Ultimate fragility
did anyone else get the sense that the guy in green was not really listening to the AMG guy explaining and was rushing and interrupting him ?
funny that he admits that the touch switches are crap. what a soulless machine.
8 sec quarter mile? im guessing
They say. You gotta. Chanbge engine every 50000 km thats the most ridiculous thing ever... An engine in anny car gotta. Last at least 1000000 miles
Hybrid Merc, half of Rimac power, slower than Bugatti and made in...uk???  200k tops
I’m waiting for the racing version to come out and bring them back to Le Mans!
AMG One Vs LaFerrari Vs Porsche 918 Spyder VS McLaren P1 ON ACTUAL RACE, MAKING FASTEST LAP TIME ... when? I`m so tire of watching the best cars ever made, being use as a dumb @ss dragsters. We get it - all rich people are unskilled morons that know only to drive with 5 klm/h in the city or floor the gas pedal in straight line. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. We want to see those 4 cars being used to their actual limits. Its what they were made for.
Ridiculous car horrible looking
What is the total torque of the car
But can it go fast????
อยากได้มาขับส่งลูกไปเรียน คงจะดี
Wow. That’s one ugly car and the new Lucid Sapphire 4 door sedan about to be released is faster. Recently tested to be the fastest production car on Earth.
The shot at 11:45 looks like Gran Turismo.
About $3 million after tax making the Tesla Roadster 2.0 affordable for the average rich man. The 2.0 has a 1.1 second 0-62 mph with the rocket booster option, CRAZY.
Most of the guys who can afford it are not capable of the car. I can only imagine what the maintenance cost are😂😂😂
Is this predecessor to amg clk gtr?
So, it is a 5 cores engine. No long ago it was single core engine.
I'd still be stuck with whichever hypercar can fit a 6'4"(193cm) 240lb(108Kg) man, AND still be able to get out, without doing a face plant, in the parking lot everytime!
I like the car but if given only one choice to pick between the AMG One and the GMA T-50, it would be the GMA T-50. Why you ask? Because the T-50 seems like a much more simple yet effective design. The fan for the downforce is much simpler than all the motors and hydraulics needed for AMG's aero which also would increase weight with all it's components. Plus, we saw how effective a fan car can be with the McMurty fancar at Goodwood destroying the record. And if you're talking about F1 engine, there's nothing more F1 than the sound of a screaming V12.
When a German engineer says “it really pushed us to our limits” you know it was hard
Back to the future   what if a Mercedes-AMG ONE would look like as a Time Machine
LOOKS LIKE A KOENIGSEGG. SAME DRIVE. JUST NOT A KOENIGSEGG....NOT EVEN CLOSE
tuker tambah sama vespa saya bisa pak?
pak satunya berapaan pak
This should be the new safety car
Legend AMG One, Timeless
would love to see the service schedule
Regarding to electric car, Tesla Roster is even faster, much much much cheaper and long range. 0-60 mph 1.9s,  top speed 250 mph,  620 miles range. Auto Drive is the highest barrier to traditional car manufacture.  Tons of people look forward to buying  Cyber Truck including me.
aaaand .005% of the world can afford it
Beautiful car. When I win the lottery I’m ordering one.
Mercedes AMG-One. For when your tax accountant reminds you that you can’t drive a house.
So it's basically a tamed F1 powerunit not a wild one
This is absolutely amazing, And I know it’s not open wheel but could DAS have worked in this car?   Imagine the grip
Here after the lap record
Combining this small fi engine into a rather heavy car despite all the other electric engines, appears somewhat misguided. Visually not very exciting. The most fascinating aspect about F1 cars is weight to power ratio, which is completely absent in this project.
That car looks insane 😍
1700KG 🤦🏻‍♂️
How long does the engine lash without loosing power or breaking ?
I remember when they claimed it to have over 1200 bhp and 0-60 in 2.5 and 0-125 in 5.5
Mha.....auto da tenere in salotto.......no grazie.
Anyone else tempted to mod it to be faster
Mercedes-Benz AMG One " one of the most fascinating machines ever made ”  https://youtu.be/bvHituco7PI
"Am I The Only One"
This just makes Gordon Murray look even more like a genius
They look like twins separated at birth
"We-heagel" Why didnt he take just a few min to check up on english pronunciation before this interview?
Mine arrives in 3 weeks, can't wait!
I wonder if this car could get a win this season.
This presenter has all the charisma of a fence post.
I'm sure we're all buying one(!)
Even the finished car is a constant failure.
What a great car.  But it’s damn ugly 🥹
Lewis Hamilton bought two of these, one for his dad and one for him.
The closest car experience to a formula 1? at 1695kg of weight?🤦
Again these other boring guys have no flair or anything interesting to say..just ZZZZzzzz
So we now know the Mercedes engine pushes 1063 hp!! MONSTER
now lets see the actual similarities it has to "the" f1 powertrain....
Absolutely gorgeous and a proper successor to the CLK GTR...   You can literally look at this car and imagine when the GTR 1st came out and saying what would it look like 20 years from now.... And this beast would be it...👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
T50 and Valkyrie have a V12. They built this car around the least loved F1 race engine generation. So it's really complicated, and you have the power, well done. But it's all about experience and this somehow really doesn't excite me as much as those others.
I find the Mercedes badge on the bonnet looks bizarre
F1 engine for the road is silly idea. Does it has neumatic valves? If not, how it is going to rev over 14krpm? Automotive enthusiasts or petrol head will prefer V12 cosworth 11krpm engines, not 1.6L
So it's twice as powerful as a Nissan GTR but is not faster 0-60?  Not doing a lot for me unfortunately. Track mode looks better though. Too bad that they used the least entertaining F1 engine to run it, but very impressive to get in functioning in a road car.  Too bad nothing on this car is revolutionary but they seem to think it is. Impressive yes, but that is it.  The valkyrie and T50 is much more impressive.
Naina mile to bt bhi h😎….
Too bad it’s not German
Hmm first vid i watch since the boys left. Nope, no feeling anymore, dont like the format this way.
I've heard hamilton demanded that buyers must sign a letter of support for BLM before being able to purchase....
But why..?
its mazda
Looks like a shark
The dude in the white shirt looks constipated 😂
It looks like a Toyota Supra 😂
How to design ugly cars
I am not sure 1063 hp will suit my needs
thats for european race tracks, the car would be trashed in the US tracks.
The car is beautiful but what's so great about putting a F1 engine in a road car when the performance figures are not better than competing super and hyper cars not powered by F1 engines?
0-100 slower than a Porsche. 0-200 slower than a 765LT. Top speed also not great.  Absolutely underwhelming
The mohawk one
We need AMG in F1, just look at this stuff!
I like the car, I dislike the painted badge.
A Hypercar..  Behind Schedule..
i wonder what the last crappy car to have a motor and electrics in it will be...like check this out bro its 1600hp 200 gas 1400 electric..why we didnt go all in beads us.  so this thing what 4/5 years after la ferrari is 50% electric.  >>  rimac is years old now and were still getting these things?
too much stories about F1....F1 here F1 There,but technologicaly is on the same way as the other production cars,Stop those cool stories about F1 world and how cool it is for 2.4-2.7mln.
This should be the F1 safety car.
Why does he have his phone out for notes??? He can’t remember the stats long enough to do the video??? 🤣 y’all need a real car guy
While this is an amazing feat of engineering, I honestly don’t see the appeal of a modern era F1 v6 against one of the otherworldly v12s in the Valkyrie or T50. It seems somewhat lacklustre in comparison.  When it was announced I understood the excitement but now it already seems uninspired and behind.   It feels more like a Mercedes advert than a project of passion.
Ahhh Deutsche Maschinenbau👍
Stupid car....
Everyone who buys this will never feel like they made a foolish investment
Electric? Oh dear
@0:47 "what would happen if you put an F1 powertrain in a road car" Very low mileage would happen. That engine won't last very long before it starts to eat itself from the inside out. 50,000km would probably be magical if it can even reach it. But I guess it wouldn't matter anyway, since the owners would probably just put in 5k-10k km at most throughout the car's life. Edit: I forgot it have electric engines. So basically if the F1 ICE engine blows up, they could probably just throw it out and put a big battery in the engine bay and just covert to full electric. Ah maybe Mercedes is looking into the future. They plan it so that when the F1 engine blows up. Everyone by then are already going full electric. So they just convert it.
Unless it heats itself to 160 Celsius before starting, it's not a f1 engine
another heavy turd
Crazy
Respect, but it’s ugly.
It's the epitome of "retarded but in a good way"
This car is so ugly... that badge on the front looks soooo bad... lol
A real testament to not just the designers and engineers, but also the management for committing to the project, which I guess cost an insane amount of money to see through to completion.
Why are you wearing a parka and a stupid big pair of sneakers !? Are you Your-a-peon or an American-can’t . Show a lil class
1000bhp is no longer remotely a hyper-car.
🚮
0-60 slower than a Tesla then?
Now THAT is what I call sexy. You did it again Mercedes-Benz.
Why? They can't make a decent sedan or suv they are soooo cheap! And maybe they can finally figure out how to wire a car so one tail light isn't always brighter than the rest.  Ever read a schematic?
why couldnt chris harris do this review ? , everyone else is irrelavent
The american made Hennessey venom f5 will mop the floor this amg
After my 2003 civic kicks this bucket I’ll give this one a try I giess
Front face/grill is fabulous
DUDE, looking at your phone to read the specs is TOTALLY unprofessional, train for your job and master it or change it. AMATER! I couldn't care less about the car given your preformance. How low has TG fallen. Disaster.
I'm not saying it's not gorgeous—it is—but it looks like it was designed in the '90s.   It looks dated.
Being a car enthusiast with no money is torture. I must succeed in my endeavor to earn monetary wealth.
is that supercar not god awful ugly? Looks like the shrek of supercars if anyone had that much money to spend.
I can only relate the anti-climatic production version of this car to the notoriously failed XJ220 project
Same 0-100 time, top speed and weight as a base aventador lol
Even in 2017 this car wouldn’t have even the fastest. In 2022 it doesn’t even make top 10 lol
All that rhetoric and the most important thing of all is missing! It would be nice if you properly drove the freaker vs yapping about it all day. 😐
I couldn't help but chuckle everytime this guy says "WEEHICLE" 😄
Sold out, the same 200 people own every one of your dream cars, not much of an exaggeration
I want the playlist😂
918 Spyder ? 🙃
They should have left all the comfort extras such as electronic steeringwheel adjjustment and even the two frontal electric motors out to save weight and make the car lighter. It is extremely heavy and because of thst defeats the purpose of having an f1 engine in the car to start with. It doesnt stand out in speed or power to the competition. And why have a pitlane speed limiter if there is no racing where it can be applied? Too gimmicky and not raw enough. The whole raw and exhilerating experience is lost. Such a shame after so many years waiting i expected better. Its just another amg now. Opportunity lost. Hopefully there will be a race version without the electric motors and comfort gimmicks............ a true f1 car on the road which is as light  as a feather and quick as lightning. Who knows maybe they'll wake up at mercedes with a project one R.
Imagine if they add ers in the features
A Williams F1 car would embarrass this Mercedes one around a track
So German, so efficient. I love it
That would be a Delage d12 for me thanks real f1 for the road there
I wonder if they had to pay Dodge for its tomahawk looking Active aero 😂
We want a Lap of Lewis in it on track and using DRS too
According to Babvvo and Tebbvo laws, sadly soon all combustion cars and trucks including classics will be banned from public streets in entire EU and Scandinavia  :-(  In Germany the Green Peoples Party gave order to shorten fuel supply from 2025  on by reducing all conventional fuel stations to only one state operated central gas station per city or county. Car washs will be forbidden too because they are climate killers, now they want to slow down all the gas station pumps from 20 litre per minute to 2 litre per minute...From 2027 on in the EU certain car spare parts will be banned too....as exhaust systems, turbo chargers and even some engine and gearbox oils...California and New York will do the same from 2027 on.... So no investments should be done in oil burning cars any longer....They even created a new kind of crime here, called emissions and smoke crime!!!!!
I like how this is the answer to the McClaren P1🤣 Like, 5 years later lmao
I just saw this car in Northampton today (Friday 15th July 2022) approaching Kingsthorpe Cemetery. I know nearby there is the Mercedes-AMG Powertrains factory in the village of Brixworth.
Drive it already…. Jesus! Why even make this video
only germans can make somrthing this interesting sound this boring.
I play GTA, so I've already owned this car for a couple years. Lol
Boring.
Boring we do not even hear drive on public road ! Total waste of 20 mins.
It’s crazy how this thing can still get walked by a plaid
But how long would the life span of the engine be and would u be able to service it yourself not that u as if u can afford this then your likely to a personal care team to look after all your outher exotic cars but would like to know what the service on this would involve
European plate in Dubai LOL
Until fuel returns to a reasonable price, nobody cares.  Even if I could afford the fuel to daily drive this, I wouldn’t dare to park it in any of the places I drive to on a daily basis.    An old merc running on used veg oil is an infinitely more attractive proposition.
all this to get beaten by bugatti
A project so challenging that the initial project manager does not seem to have brought it over the finish line. See IAA 2017 https://youtu.be/5KIFePpcos0
Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38
I am one of the lucky 275 people that’ll get to own one of these. I can’t wait to try it on track, open it a bit on the road, just another hundred thousand credits and she’ll make a great addition to my forza 5 garage……..#blessed
Unfortunately, it is just so ugly. I'd take the T50 every time.
Glad to see Merc spending more time developing this car, rather than helping their f1 drivers not get brain damage from porposing.
I needed a 20 minute video to do my cycling workout. Holly shit was this video boring, I nearly fell off the godamn bike. Lunch in a foster home is more fun than this. Get your shit together TopGear!
Top gear is not topgear without the idiot trio😢
Too soft looking, bulky and the game has moved on since 2017.
Fact check: A person who can afford this car wont have a problem with the sound waking up the neighbors, they simply are their own neighbors 😂😂😂
Awkward interview is hard to watch
It’s stats are very mediocre
Bmw already dis this with the e60 m5. And that was a much more exiting f1 engine
Logo airbrushed, not sure how I feel about it… feels wrong.
Cool car but top gear sucks compared to how it was
The Mercedes logo really doesn't look right on this.
I'm like watching something out of the OG Taxi movie. Holy shit that's good!
BUUUUUU Porshe 918 its faster car from 2010 xD BUUUUU TOP GEAR where is the critic opinion 2.9s to 100km/h 7s to 200km/h at 1690kg weight , HIPER SH.. not a car BUUUU
But is it a daily driver?
I was part of the team that worked on the first campaign images for this car back in 2016/17 (The animations you see at 1:25 also done by the same team). Slightly sick of the sight of the car, but glad they've finally overcome the issues and got it on the road.
ze weeheekle
Just read it off ya phone bro, shoot in one take
Can't be the only one who's not a fan of the painted Mercedes logo.
This interview highlights the trend now of all these YouTuber people who are not engineers, who merely regurgitate stats they are told are somehow the ones getting to review these cars and make the money from doing that. It evolved from back when it wasn't big money, these geeky car dudes would go talk a lambo dealership into some free ad space in exchange for borrowing a car to shoot a review. Now they are getting to reveal the most cutting edge cars for some reason. The question I have from watching this, is what the interviewer is needed for? What does he contribute? He just ads in boring small talk reconfirming generalized concepts the engineer describes. Why does he deserve the opportunity to make this video, he is clearly not exceptionally intelligent on this car, or even exceptionally talented as a personality- he literally shot himself reading off his stats on his notes app from his iPhone. It must be nice to make millions of dollars and get access to such prestigious machinery without being talented or being able to contribute anything meaningful to the conversation. It's like if someone was a wide receiver in the NFL with a 6 second 40 yard dash time.
247 Units only, at a price of 2.4 million Pound each, all sold out. That's 247 Hypercar being made only to just to sit still in a parking lot most of its time...Imagine being born with super power, intelligence and beauty, but all you are allowed to do is to sit, and periodically get medical check up until you get thrown away in some dark warehouse. What a sad fate...
So an F1 engine and FOUR electric motors only gets you to 1063hp and 2.9sec 0-60 ?   All for $3million a crack???   A full second slower than the upcoming $200k Tesla Roaster…
Just get #1 factory driver and British racing legend George Russell to promote the car and I bet it will sell like hot cakes.
Do anyone in comment section afford anything Mercedes-Benz?🤣😅🤣
nice vw
and its already obsolete as a 200k electric will blow it off the road.
Looking for something to drive grams to church and bingo. This might fit the bill.
Mercedes-AMG One 63👌🏿 1063 horsepower not a Coincidence
So Mercedes acknowledges that the buttons on the steering wheel are distracting when they're not tactile or "mechanical"... but continues to force them on us in their other models? I get that other models are not putting down the same power as this but if you know traditional buttons are just easier/safer to use then why not just have them on every model?
Mate I get that you are excited, but please have some composure. Always interrupting with "ye! mhmm! ye! mhmm", or making questions that you end up answering yourself. At some point it was just annoying.
was ein hässliches Auto. ein königseggverschnitt! sonst nix. nur in hässlich. 😅😅😅
Dont like it and  hurricane faster 2.9 to 60mph if very slow these days and costing £2.4 million
Lewis Hamilton = 🔔END
To whoever is reading this comment: if you buy me this car, I'll subscribe to your channel!
isn't a posrche faster than this car and like 1/4 of the price?
2.4 million pounds and they couldn't integrate those bloody tablets better? COME ON!
Volume level?!? WTF
I'm sure I have 2.4 million under a couch cushion or something...
Omg 😱 what is the world have turn to.  A Tesla off the shelf can go faster in 0-100
So are they all sold or not because I'm going to buy one
are you hiring? need work.
hopefully they'll accept my Peugeot as a trade in.
Which button turns the porpoising on/off?
hello james moriarty of top gear.
Does it have an overtake button or do you have to switch the car to strat 2?
i just stopped looking at all those cars that i will never drive .. that are build for people who drive people of my class into being poor and feeling wothless! just came in to unsub!
nice cgi
Not that it matters, I can barely afford my bicycle, but somehow I just haven’t been able to get excited about this car since the day it got announced, unlike the Valkyrie. The engineering that went into it is more than impressive though
Geez this is so typical of Top Gear these days. What an amazing subject matter presented in such a dull way
I think Mercedes had a more radical version in mind and that's why it took them so long. In the end they settled for a more dialed down version, which is a bit disappointing but still cool.
Seems like a wish version of the 1:1 segg. Also why would a pandemic interrupt the making of this car? It’s Mercedes, multibillion dollar contracts get priority that most people don’t see in resources buddy. That’s why the average people were pushed down the line to make room.
I did not expect myself to watch this entire video. Well done!
I can't believe how stuck Merc is in interior design, carrying over their 'I-give-up' design language of cheaper cars. Looks like they stuck two over-sized iPhones as display/control panels and said "yep...looks good". Sorry boys - you need help to properly integrate the form and function. Starting hint: The whole inside is curved but these rectangles stick out like bollocks on a bee. They hurt my eyes.
This car is like the modern sport of F1… an outdated joke.
So for some reason the c8 corvette can get to 60 mph just as quickly with half the horsepower.
German engineers killing it again
Did I miss the part where they spoke about the actual f1 power unit? What did they use?
Torn between this or honda ADV 150
no guys i think its called the krieger
That’s a good looking w heetle 😂
They should do this programme but use the guys that do the grand tour…
Lap performance > stupid and pointless horse power or high speed record chases.
I think all these mid engined hyper/Supercars are forming an amorphous blob of sameness. The whole category is boring me. I can’t afford one, and if I could, I’d buy a Yamaha Tenere 700 and tour the world. If you put a gun to my head, and told me to buy a car, I’d get a base 911 manual. That’s all the car most people need.
did he say 11 mile range haha
Did they really pain in the logo to be more aerodynamic. AAAAAAUGH?
its impressive but i'd still take the LFA with the orgasmic V10 over this, nothing else sounds quite like that car
Only if Königsegg didn't beat Mercedes to it.
Crossed the candy cane in the video on the track?! Why though? Why
This should be the new safety car in F1
How's the purposing on this car?
Meh, another vehicle that is not attainable
Does it come with porpoising or is that an optional feature?
Should make a full EV version .
Shame it's only one
They just stole the koenigsegg Agera body, put an Corvette z06-style bumper on it and tweaked it for better aerodynamics. I was expecting an entirely new lush, exquisite, futuristic and out-side-of-the-box design from Mercedes… i was expecting something that would really make you go wow, what an exotic, out of this world looking car. I didnt expect something so generic.
Porpoising is a no cost option 👍
Front looks like a Mazda rx8 lol
Door line is not perfacrly continuing to the back..
Looks like a shovelnose catfish.
Why it feels like Mercedes build more badass 918 Spyder but can we get AMG One without roof too???
Mercedes OMG 😱
Bought one and its amazing! great handling for its speed, won a lot of races in fh5
I'll take one in red...i.o.u ok?
Beautiful piece of machinery
I know taste differs, but this is a gloriously ugly design IMHO. Impressive tech, but still…
big face
Well, I wonder if the AMG One has the porpoising feature?
Put this up against the alpha 12.
Does it come with porpoising included?
This Wehiekl
Um, this total being presented, can the car ever actually experience all of it at the same time? Isn't 163hp of it only used during initial acceleration and maybe gear changes?
He never said ENGINE HP  ?????????
Weehetl
Probably worth to start petitioning for Lewis and George to arrive in Silverstone in these babies.
That Mercedes guy looks and sounds like Roll no : 01 during Viva💀
Can they use it in WEC?
Can they use it in WEC?
Aston Valkyrie looks more exciting.. just a better machine than this..
I wonder if it porpoises as well?
Awesome supercar! 👏💗🚗
Should have been Chris Harris not this dude smh
It still is slower than model s plaid
Would like to see a stage 1 gt2rs vs this on track. Probably comparable times!
Disappointed this was stuck as a youtube video and didn't make the programme proper.
All I dream for this car is that it’s as close to modern F1 as the CLK GTR was to Le Mans when it was made.
any porpoising ?
I admire the relentless pursuit of simplicity in this day and age.  Maintenance should be doable on my driveway.
PUT AWAY YOUR PHONE
The intro song was been done in Yoruba language I think.. I picked up Olori Ogun at the beginning..
Wow same 0-60 an an M5 nice Mercedes!
The combined 1063HP figure is a big deal because you know it is real, it's not just an empty number as opposed to other ridiculous cars, it's evident that it's backed by some serious engineering. And to top it off, it's not a perfect, round number, just something to think about. Also - look at those NACA ducts on the rear and that active aero, damn, son.
Meh
The rear is suspiciously similar to a Koenigsegg Regera.
In other words, it tool them decades to come up with a car that can be destroyed by a Tesla.....🤦
This has to be the new safety car
This looks like its going to put every track toy and tuner to shame. Is it a mid engine amg gt?  Its sorta like the new slr mclaren in a way.  But looks like a clk-gtr modernized. A mercedes took their shot at their own mclaren f1?
Can't wait until we get our first "idiot in amg one" crash compilation
Useless car, you cannot use in the normal road
Love this car ❤️❤️❤️
It's a failed project.
looks like a corvette...
Design is off on this one
The KERS and DRS along with the active aerodynamics and F1 technology has made this my dream hybrid.
Not really impressive in speed… 219mph… My 12 yo BMW M5 can go 205 mph. Doesn't seem to be getting much from that “F1 power unit  I would have expected 250mph… especially for the price.
This is a well designed car.
That painted badge is awkward.  It's has a massive drop shadow that assumes light is striking the car from behind.
Beautiful art on wheels, I love the air flaps over the wheel arch, too reduced air pressure inside the wheel arch and it helps with the aerodynamics. They look like fish Giles, as I watch them pop up and down Beautiful art, Just sub and 👍🏿.
sad thing is this is just an investment, nobody is going to really drive this
I am going to order one asap
Id rather like to own once more my 1.6 litre scirocco II from the 80s
Looks like a modern Audi and a old Jaguar 1994 XJ220 mixed
I don't think Mercedes has ever produced a genuinely beautiful sports car.
With all the delays and in 2022, that non-swan neck wing looks positively old.
Why is it so slow?
Why did you have him talking over the sound of the car? Strange editing choice.
AMG 1 vs Mclarne Senna!!
Listen, that's not "an F1 powertrain." We've heard this for thirty years now since McLaren F1. F1 cars are destruct devices, built only for one sprint race and to be rebuilt after that. The tolerances are so crazy on the engines they are seized before a race and have to be primed. The F1 car IDLES at 5000 RPMs, this one at 2000. They did put pneumatic valve "springs" on it, which the McLaren never had, I laud them for that. But many internals are different. Frankly, I'm out over just the electric motors (it has 4) and the 220 pound battery. They start sticking this in "F1 powertrains" it's over for me, I'm a purist. I'm fine w/ the electric turbo boost, but only if it ran off a standard battery and that's not happening w/ the thing spinning up to 100k rpms instantly. This car is a little motor w/ electric blenders and a battery the mass of a grown man. No thanks.
Redline?
Black hair with a red beard........ oh the car..... spectacular. As someone else commented, should be used for the f1 safety car.
WOW
Ο Πανόπουλος θα κάνει καλύτερο υπεραυτοκίνητο 😎.
Dont talk test drive go to nurburgring
Yes folks, it's finally here. Yet another pointless high performance car for the 1%. And to make matters worse, they have all been sold out already so even if you win the lottery, you can't have one......
These modern hypercars and supercars are quite special but I can't help but think if Gordon Murray and BMW teamed up again we'd have the ultimate machine, again.
Highway mode is for the open road, race mode is for the track.  Yeah, you just know that everybody lucky enough to get one will drive on race mode every time they get in it. Unless Mercedes sneaks in some hidden GPS software that knows where all race tracks are and locks the mode unless the car detects that it's on a track. Or even more annoyingly, you need to call Mercedes every time you're on a race track and they send a guy to unlock it with a code.
So can you use track mode on the street?? I’d be strat2 all the time
$2.7 Million dollars
no middle seat no care
and its not even fast
and how does in make 1700 KG?
Its definitely Ugly
Great we-heecle
please car god. give me one of this!
So basically we have 4 electric motors, a hybrid system, turbos, millions of $$$ in r&d.... all to make about the same power as a $500 junkyard LS motor with basic bolt-ons, and none of the LS reliability. Cool?
put your phone down it's not an open mic poetry gig
does'it porpoise ?
Impressive, sure.  But will it do a backflip like a 1999 CLR?
An incredible achievement of Mercedes and amazing that they have been able to implement all those track features in to the car. Bu I don’t think customers wouldn’t have bought it if there wasn’t DRS ore a qualifying lap set up. I don’t think the average billionaire has the talent ore even wants to drive this car on the limit but I could be wrong. I think most of them are gonna be tucked away safe and added to there collection.
Impressive tech but Id still take a carrera gt over this ❣️
yea.. i wanna see this on the Nurburgring 🤩
Whos gonna stop anyone from putting it in Strat 2 mode on the freeway or roads. I dont doubt it
Finally a car for the 0.00001% group
1063hp for 1700kg? That’s no better than the old Veyron Supersport. In real life, this thing will be no faster than an SF90.
As a Merc fan, hopefully they based the F1 technology on this car off last years car and not this years! Lewis and George might not have any teeth left after a season of bouncing around, cant imagine the 1% who buy this car to find no teeth appealing!
How much German accent would you like? The weheekel...
I was chatting to the AMG salesman at Mercedes-Benz World Brooklands today, and he has a client that has bought one. It's going to be doing Power Laps on the MB race track if anyone wants to see it........watch this space!
I bet the yearly cost of insurance for this car is more than the cost of my BRZ 🥲. Nicely done Mercedes-Benz for making something magical.  Not sure how I feel about those screens: doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the car.
Seems to miss the mark on so many levels…weight…power…complexity. Aston Martin and Gordon Murray must be laughing.
Car is beautiful but for other options out there with a v8 like the agera, the Mercedes is over complicated its not like the batteries are going to last you decades like the classic supercars. Imagine buying this car and putting it in your collection and in 10-30 years you cant even drive the car because the batteries are dead and out of production.... wish they would of just kept the f1 motor and kept it a true sports car with longer life span to keep and drive the car
Don't buy it ... I made the circuit boards quality control was crap..
Amazing car but black alloys spoil her 😕
Extremely complex, and still quite heavy.   Valkyrie is not practical to get into and out of.  T50 seems lighter, simpler and better.
I would like to wake up neighbors..
Painted badge lol really
It was so cringe when the interviewer brought up Lewis Hamilton
Apart from W222 and C217, this is the only coupe/sedan/hatch Mercedes that doesn't look ugly. Looks great actually, finally Mercedes decided to design something nice and made car that resembles Porsche 918
Very impressive .... This will make an amazing addition to the collections of so many who will never drive them .. and the public can gaze upon them once each year when they are brought out for dusting and polishing before being shipped to sit in an air-conditioned tent at Goodwood or Pebble Beach.  Of course, there will be videos of one running the Nurburgring with professional racing drivers at the wheel .. (Reader, please read aloud with sad sarcastic tone, and a gentle sigh at the end) ..
Nope
$$$$$$$$
Pretty pointless really. Way too heavy. Ridiculous servicing costs. I don't understand why you'd get this over for instance a Jesko/Valkyrie/AMR Pro. I'd even have the ugly T50 over this; it's certainly going to be better and faster at least. I'm not even sure this will be faster than a Porsche GT2RS  MR for about 15% of the money on most tracks, it's got 300hp less but is also 300kg lighter. Stictly a car for collectors buying it as a novelty investment because of the F1 engine.
This is one of those time if I was a car journo I'd be reminded of how much I love my job. I mean, even as a viewer, i get goosebumps from just watching this video on a small phone screen & listening to this Merc gentleman displaying his knowledge of the car.
AMG One with 'Super Pursuit Mode'
In age of Tesla model s plaid , this model comes little too late , they had anyway sold out the order book so doesn't matter to Mercedes
The best Mercedes road car since the CLK GTR?
Wished he asked about the engine needing rebuilding every certain mileage
700kg with 300hp is my ideal. Thankfully I dont have several million dollars to be thinking about this purchase.
No America release!! It could not meet safety standards :(
I just hope this time you will not gonna blow it like the Mazda Furai! It's already all sold and build, but we won't forget Top Gear waste a prototype and we want this Furai to compete with this German Beast!
Already sold out? Too many rich people. Save some for real car enthusiasts.
Soon BMW answer to  MERC AMG ONE will be revealed
They should take it to Le Mans. Looks like it would do a fantastic backflip.
Wow, remember when Top Gear used to be exciting? 🙃
Mercedes name-dropping Lewis countless times. Lewis is the brand
there should be NO OPTIONS on a $2 million vehicle
*New safety car*
I'd like to see what it can do around the Nordschleife
1700kg or 3700lbs is a PIG. That's a heavy car!
I like that F1 vibe of the painted badge. Beautiful car, i’ll probably never drive it but I’m glad it exists
Looks very underwhelming
This is the come to live version of the steriotype of germans having no idea what humor or even a smile could be. XD actually pretty untypical though most Germans have great humor, trust me
What an utterly pointless car. Will look great sitting in an underground parking lot in Dubai. Noone will ever race it, noone will ever drive it properly. Stats are underwhelming tbh. Basically a way overpriced 918 that is 9 years late and less usable.
Weeeehiiikle
Practical question... In 30 years when all the engineers of this car have retired,  who the F is going to have the knowledge to maintain/repair a car like this?
Me being 21 thinking what kind of lives people live that they can buy this off rip😂
when he goes to track mode it reminds me of Knight Riders car "kit" when he goes Into super speed mode lol.. absolutely love it
Next up: road- and tracktest. I can't wait to see it.
2millions to get a car with F1 engine is really cheap for those wealthy peoples
I was expecting a road test and it would have been nice to hear that F1 they keep bragging about. Sometimes a shut up and listen says more than words.
Did he mention what ice engine it has? He skipped right to the electric motors.
Free car charging by Tesla
Is everyone forgetting the Ferrari F50?
I like that automakers are moving towards yoke steering.
Looks so bland and boring for a hypercar
Was expecting to hear more of the actual car.  Pretty disappointing
The old school top gear would have made this video 10x better
Yep, if Jeremy Clarkson isn't involved then it just doesn't feel like Top Gear.
2.4 million quid? How much is that in real money?
1700 kg? thats crazy....
Oh my, It's... it's beautiful
All that talking and never even heard it run.
Yeah, I’ll take an E55 and bank the rest.
not impressed
Rofl reading off his phone, so unprofessional. What has top gear become
11 mile EV range LOL
Probably doesn't sound that good (just like the f1 car) that's why there wasn't a soundcheck in the video but I think having a high-revving road legal hypercar is cool. Call me out if I'm wrong but I haven't seen anything rev above 9.5k rpm on the road (+1 for the high-revving AM Valkyrie as well, and it's a V12 so another +1 )
The body of the "Mercedes-AMG One" is a wonderful basis for the GT Sport. It would be nice if such vehicles were built according to the GT regulations and these vehicles were offered to racing teams all over the world.
Listening to the product manager talking like an outdated robot, I see why AMG One project was delayed like crazy.
https://youtu.be/uEesib-JV_w
Krieger???
275 Customers must feel got scabbed. This is already born outdated. And there isn't any Merc domination in F1 anymore.
I wanna know if the engine is actually within f1 tolerances....because if it is, there's no way it would be reliable for a longer period
"16 steps for the logo" and all the fancy weightsaving and it weighs 1700kg's. I get it you get an F1 engine and a very sophisticated car but a T50 is so so much more interesting to me. This is just heavy even tho they did all the lightweight stuff, and all these drive modes why?
too complicated ... that car ue on the day of its sale already after death. Mercedes drove it all the way
please go back to ABC or graveyard hour television were you belong. fruitloops.
I wait for 2063hp version
this car build for show to world the technology Mercedes AMG PETRONAS got since they join F1 race. This is signed as a champions of the world.
Still came early than the roadster 2.0 👀
It`s just a crazy car
This, or a W201 180E? Hmm ...
All the buyers of this car will never drive it  ,  just keep it locked away  ,   what is the point  ?
I hope this beast will feature in gran turismo 7
Aventador SVJ can beat it
The damn Mercedes star is so cheap omg
The piece of chit weighs twice as much as an F1 car but only has slightly more horsepower, who thought this was a good idea? Only dummies would buy it, imagine how muchtime it needs to be in the shop with so many point of failures
it's vehicle
The main question is can it compete with bolide?
They should make a version with less exotic materials and nicely tuned twin turbo V8 without the hybrid.
As they have developed an app for the owner to utilise the car.. I'm surprised he didn't demonstrate, or, they don't have 'Driving Modes' buttons within the app which could be pressed whilst the driver is outside/walking up to the car so that the car 'Prepares' its driving mode state before the driver gets in.... 🤔😏    😎🇬🇧
About as attractive as a Vector W8
The KRIGER of GTAV ONLINE 😍🤩
Wait, a 2 million dollar car has options....... so you could spend 2 million dollars and get a base model 🤣.
yes 1063hp is actually a joke now
Wow, they waited so long that they made their own stats unimpressive.
Looks like a mclaren.
so whats the service interval on this thing? 5 laps?
Actually it looks hideous.
VEHEECLE
He couldn't wait to jump in that car , why didn't he let you sit  in it
Concept car made real = millions. Drop shadow on logo made in Paint = 2 bucks.
1700kg is impressively light?  Gordon Murray is coughing rather forcefully, the GMA T-50 is under 1000kg
Would like to know if any of the peoples comments about Valkyrie is better or other examples they have given are indeed superior actually ever driven the said example or this Mercedes??   Just because you’ve watched top gear doesn’t mean your Jeremy Clarkson 🤦🏼
@Doğankabak
the tech is great, the design is a bit bland in comparison to koeniggsegg and ferrari etc etc.
ONE? what an original name. cant believe anyone hasn't used that yet. cant believe Koenigsegg or Aston Martin hasn't use a variation of it at least. lol should have just called this the new CLK-GTR.
Music name at the beginning?
now a Chris Harris drives!
The rear is from audi and the front is like a sea cobs,  but the technical content is amazing
When you say 0-60 in 2.9 I just get bored and turn off. This is not groundbreaking. The 911 turbo s and the Ferrari sf90 will beat that. Aren’t Tesla about to release something that hits 60 under 2 seconds??! Come on
The active aero is like super-pursuit mode from Knight Rider.
So let me guess. The car will porpoising, like all the Mercedes F1 car 😬
This is an incredibly cool car, and it's a huge feat to put an F1 derived engine into a roadcar, but it's worth pointing out that this isn't the first roadcar with an F1 engine. Porsche, Ferrari and BMW, among others, have all done this in the past.
Can`t wait for Brabus to tune this one up a bit.
I can't be the only one who taught that badge was a sticker
Ferrari tried with the f50. Not much can be said of it.
GTA ONLINE BE LIKE: "COPY THAT"
💀💀💀🌹💣👊
I own a Japanese Aqua 2018 I just don’t know why I’m looking into this but I love it. I know I can’t have it but why not dream about
Weeheecle
can‘t wait to get mine😍
This baby is beautiful!
I can't see the reason for Mercedes to build this car. They will always be behind. Yes, it has a F1 engine, but what? Cars like Königsegg will leave it behind, in all aspects, anyway
Ive been waiting so long it already feels dated
This reminds me of the LFA. Designed to bring F1 tech to the road, overbudget, delivered too late, everyone complaining about the spec sheet on launch. Well, I expect once they stop selling them people will put it up on a pedestal just like they did with the Toyota.
All that talk and we never get to see the actual power unit!
"with F1 engine"  wallet: "ahh shit here we go again"
Wieso sind es immer Ludwigsburg Kennzeichen? 😅
Lmao 11 mile EV range. Well at least I guess you can use it when you're stuck in traffic.
Wooow amazing car 🚘
Looks like the veilside rx7
‘When u wanna leave the house early and u don’t wanna wake up the neighbours’ nobody that buys this car will have neighbours😭😭😭
The American Version Has 0.0 HP.
Another pointless car. To heavy, too expensive, waste of time to be completely honest
And yet a plaid is 1 second quicker 0 to 100 kmh in a straight line?
same weight as 918 but 145 more horse power, more aero and drivability. Can it smash the P1 LM or GT2RS MR Nurburgring lap time?
Can't reach 300
Porsche 918 look better imo and I also like the Maserati mc20
Lol T.50s would shit on this. It sounds even better
Someone from Ferrari should buy this and tear it down to look at the power unit 😂😂
1700 kg?? Quite disappointed with that. I thought they would bring something like a 1200kg car. And where is that weight coming from? I mean a F1 car of that generation weighs less than 800kg. Even with batteries and a bigger chassis, where did the put another ton lol?
So if you want to see this car on the road you best book your next holiday to Abu dabi
Super jojo
Vicky
Looks and sounds like a dog, compared to the Valkyrie or even the T50 !!
that front is so fuzzy, filled with holes for the air , if they had  a bigger and lower bonnet would look nicer!
Looks like that one car from gta5, can't remember the name tho
Production was held up due to ironing out porpoising.
I’m pretty sure one of the senior engineers is quoted as saying if they knew how difficult the project was going to be they wouldn’t have attempted it. Still, hats off to AMG for getting it done.
Ohhh… ummm.. yeah it looks great… ahhh 😕
An old f1 engine would be cool. This is just a very expensive rice burner. God it sounds terrible
I would much rather have the Aston.  The day I have to make that choice….  This thing weighs as much as my M5.. yuck.  On the other hand the Valkyrie is the same as my Miata.
14:05 IS THAT DAS?😳😳😳😳😳😳
Problem here is it's taken so long for them to get it to market that it's actual old on the face of it. Irrelevant almost. It isn't going to set the world alight and smash a load of records like Mercedes wanted it to back when they announced the project.
I can't help but be a little disappointed by this. It's 4 years late, very heavy, and 0-124 in 7 seconds is rather slower than the Ferrari SF90.
I know, I should be impressed. But I’m not. The question is: Why?  🤔
Nazis have come a long way from the beetle lol
It's probably the next McLaren F1
The fact that they can now use a F1 engine in a roadcar speaks more to how lame F1 has become than how great the ONE is.
I like it,I will buy a Dacia Spring 😅
Waiting for FF francise
We NEED this in Nintendo Mario Kart !!!
it's....kinda ugly tho
Those mirrors are massive
Is this car the reason why Mercedes are not upto the mark this season? 🤔
Looks like a fancy Mazda...
Just not sure about it......
id imagine that this car could have shed an insane amount of weight and dropped the hybrid system where the small amount of power gained by the electric motors could have been offset by the lower weight. I do understand that this car had to do it because of the theme, i wonder what the specs of a petrol only model would have been, im sure a prototype had this set up initially
I guess the only question is, will we see Bottas drive one?
Hmm, if Nikola taught me anything it's never trust a car that you don't see driving (uphill) 🤣  Seems like a production car should be able to be driven by a Top Gear driver. Just sayin'.
This red headed guy needs to chill out on the nose beers before doing an interview.
What a beautiful vehicle from Mercedes-AMG since the CLK-GTR. Keep up the great work.
That was painfully awkward. These German engineers are so damn smart but so serious. I would love to hear what it’s like to take a high speed corner
The question is: would Clarkson be amused?
I ordered one...Promise
The best or nothing......
These specs aren't even comparable to the Porsche 918 that came out almost a decade ago.
That's a nice wee hickle
Very boring
Honestly lost some interest in this car.
Who remembers the Renault Espace F1? 🤣🤣
Did it say what it revs to?
I like the fact that fans of F1 racing are now just a LITTLE bit closer to living out a daydream of actually racing. To have this type of engine in a street car is amazing. And yeah, I get it's a Hypercar but so what. It's something now on the street. And like it was mentioned earlier - no team of engineers and the like required.   Very impressive!!!
If I was looking for that shape I'd just buy a Lotus Evora GT and save a shit ton of money and I could actually use it as a daily driver. I just don't need that type of speed on these pothole infested streets.
will there be a right-hand drive model later?
They built a road car with DRS.   Mercy.
Beautiful car, but I'll stick to my 2013 Acura TL
And how is this better than my base jetta🤣
No way they get built and shipped out this year
You couldn't give me that car because it's too low to the ground
No manual? I think I'll pass...
14:08 Bruh just messed up his fresh Nikes 😂
Looks nice on the outside but they ruined the interior by slapping in 2 iPads.. Though I'll never have the money to buy anything like this so my opinion is irrelevant
Tolles Auto , Video aber Sorry  , was ein schlechtes Englisch, da muss MB  einen Sprachkurs spendieren.
You can't trust me with any car of over 500hp
Heavy pig of a super car...
This guy bores me to death, unfortunately neither him nor BBC gets it. Jack Rix you are great as just presenting, just keep it short.
Car's taken way too long to get into production, with that price tag I'll rather buy konigseeeeq absolute. I don't even find it special anymore and if I had money I wouldn't bother.
I bet a big, heavy Bugatti could beat this around a circuit.
What happend when you drop a F1 engine into a production car? You get a goofy car.
My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.
Looks like the XJ220
What a beauty
8:54 onward "Lets show them the changes!"  *instantly negates their own camera angle by needless twisting and other BS camera editing that makes the changes completely negligible as they're impossible to see the moment the change in mode is initiated*  Don't.... don't do this, why take away an awesome lil moment to make this genuinely horrible editing choice???? just an uninterrupted side profile with the drop'd been infinitely better then whatever nonsense you did was.
Portugal 🇵🇹 here 👍👍
You have to pay more for those wheels??.. on a £2:4 million car..
so they built a 918 coupe? lol
Heavy overweight pos, yea no thanks.
1700KG!!! Gordon Murray must be pissing himself laughing!  Is the chassis made from cast-iron?
I do not know about this car, it's taken half a century to put into production and the world is a very different place to what it was in 2017. It seems to car is old before, it even comes out?
Design is meh. Looks like a mclaren and Lamborghini had a baby
Booooring. Tech overkill, T. 33 smokes It...
275 being made selling at $2.5 mil...and all 275 already sold out!!!
they took most shy, most dry, most quiet engineer to promote their craziest car😅
I really wish Jaguar would have went through with the production of the CX75
Great engineering!
We'll see how it's lap times compare to Murray's machine but 1700kg is a bit lardy... Looks  brilliant though.
"ahm,yes,love it, genius, so fun," this guy is so annoying .
"Between your legs there is a part, you can pull on it" I was like uhhh
Really looks like they took a lot from the koeniggseg one
No doubt it would cost the same as a house, and, if in an accident, I can imagine you would come of worse. OK, looking car, but it's not exactly pretty. What, no Stig test? Disappointing! Where's Jeremy Clarkson when you need him.
Does it have a porpoising mode?
love how this car is probably better than the 2022 F1 car
wackos tv how loved it
Please tell me one of those three pointed stars is RED . ( FOR YOU NIKI 💜 )
This is late just by a year 😂They probably though thell be World Champions in 2021 too and will have a sure win in 2022
I hope this car is in Gran Turismo 7
1700kg Murray & Newey must be wetting themselves laughing
Looks like an Audi at the rear.
Lets see if vice grip garage can get it to run and drive 600 miles
First successor to the clk gtr dtm? xD :D
DOESNT RUN ON FUEL THEY WONT LET US KNOW THE SSSSS-SECRET.
👍 👏
Porsche produced a hyper car (918 Spyder) with an Le Mant power train 8 years ago, MB AMG made it just with a F1 power train today.
Personal I don't like the front: prove me wrong
The centre display looks like they found it in the parts bin, so sad…but otherwise super amazing
rather Aston Martin valkary
very nice
oh good. I was in the market for something with these features.......
that'a a nice wee-hicle.
What a toy?!
Guy looks like Sebastian Vettel in 144p
So much development money etc into this car and weighs 3500 pounds and the T50 weighs 1k less
Such BBC-type nonsense; dressed like a little boy.
Wow! 275 customers if you multiply it by $2.7m that's a lot of money, mercedes are really making money from this
Time is short   To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
I can listen to Brits say hour for entertainment
Another car that will most likely even though street legal be sat in a thermo controlled garage somewhere  for 99.9999% of its life.
Mercedes wow, Let’s make a car with a F1 motor for the road. With less HP than almost every other hypercar With less speed than almost every other hypercar Looking as a Jesko Absolut at the side if the vents above the front wheels are closed  Super innovative Mercedes!! Did I mention already heavier and more expensive than other hypercars. Did I mention alreay that Koenigegg One exists (original name???)
Really great insights
That is one hell of a weehickle.
Notice, no startup, engine sound or even having the car move under its own power yet.
Most German dude ever
1:07 OMGG THE VENTS AND NACA DUCTS
The bonnet veins look cool
What song is in the beginning?
I know that I'll never be able to drive this but just to see this live would be amazing!!!
OUCH! VW/Porsche just had its A$$ handed to it.
All that work and 99% won’t even drive it.
As powerful as a family sedan, I mean model S plaid
Can't help but let out internal chuckles every time the guy says wihicle😂😂😂
Such a boring host... Tell me what I read about...
Project top
Nice video
This will chew its rivals in sec. AMG forever 🤘🏻💪🏻
Mercedes should race this in le mans.
I HOPE THEY USE THE F1 ENGINE FROM 2021 SEASON!! THE ONE FROM 2022 SUCKS!!!...JUST SAYIN' .....😸😸😸😸
This car looks old now i don't know why. Personally I would prefer the Aston Martin Valkyrie.
Does it suffer from porposing? 😁
w e h i c l e
another fast bucket... whooopie...
Jesus, this was boring as hell.
Why and where will it be built in the U.K.
I can't wait to watch the compilation of 14 year old Dubai princes wrapping them around lampposts.
Isnt it fantastic that Mercedes finest engineers are English. Well done Mercedes AMG F1 Brackley England !
ahhh... sounds good i'll take 1
Why is it so incredibly heavy? 1695 kg! The old McLaren F1 supercar from the '90s was only 1,138 kg. But even the other modern hybrid hypercars weigh less this thing, and they have bigger engines.
Put a f1 powertrain in a road car, don’t talk about the single most important thing - the engine
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
Mercedes Marketing Team: “This is not a WEhicle. It’s a YOUhicle”
Is it just me or is 3700 pounds an astronomical amount? Especially compared to the Valkyrie that’s 2200
Aí humilhou os pobres
Porche with fins
As looks go 🤐   As engineering goes ' amazing.   Not so sure it's relevant in today's ever changing world. Apart from your ego of course.
a German should talk about this car in his own language!
amg made a ford gt
Ironically, I was watching Clarkson's video comparison between the SLS Black Edition and the fully-electric SLS and... The difference between this video and that it's quite dramatic. In a bad way.  Not only Clarkson's narrative it's way more funnier and colourful, with his distinctive mannerisms and way of speech; the camera angles, soundtrack, transitions, the edition overall it's also quite superior. It was thrilling to see!  I don't like fully-electric cars, and yet, that video managed to make me like them!   As for this video... (Yawns) I know it's hard to beat, or at the very least, compare with the "original" Top Gear cast, but Jack Rix isn't exactly an entertainer. Muted voice, lack of identity on screen, he don't carry that "energy" not only that make us love cars so much but to make people like them too, and that's something Too Gear needs so desperately.  I'm aware this video is more "informative" than anything but it's so plain, so simple... We're talking about one of the greatest engineering pieces of the last decade and this fellas make it feel quite boring, while all us should be excited!   I hope the BBC can fix this whole fiasco, once and for all.
Practically a street legal F1 car
Its not the first time an F1 powertrain has been dropped into a supercar/hypercar, have they forgotten about the Ferrari F50?
I swear if it doesn't even come with a helmet with drinks tube and a button for water what's the point
Cool Koenigsegg
For that money I would expect mercedes to beat all other cars so actually it’s kinda a disappointment
Mercedes-AMG One: 1063 hp, 1695 kg. Koenigsegg Jesko: 1600 hp, 1420 kg. Nuff said.
Weeheecle
Buggati killer !
Will we see this car setting a time in the nurburgring? It would be great
How ridiculous, you pay 2½ million for this car but you still have to pay more for the better magnesium wheels. I thought the idea here was that you are getting the best.
Seria o fim das reclamações dos pilotos de Formula 1 para o ritmo do Safety Car? Would this be the end of Formula 1 drivers' complaints about the Safety Car's pace?
which version of f1 engines, capacity, v?
OMG I HAVE A KLEGO VERSION OF THISS 😫😫😫😫😫
Finally get an F1 engine into a production car. Yet it is the most undesirable F1 engine of all time. Shame.
Faboulous car! It was so good that Mercedes produced a couple for the WEC/2023 at least a competition-client version, who Knows!
Setsuna Yuki and Ai Miyashita love the new AMG ONE as well.
Sorry but you are done with out Clarkson May and Hamound .. this program is alive only by them producing it ..with all respect to all other producers
p1 that is late and slower...."well done, mercedes"
0-62mph in 2.9s?     phahahaa   AHAHAAHHA
Pity their current F1 car is the pits! Lewis in a non-performing car is embarrassing! With everything he has suffered recently, it is a wonder he doesn’t throw the towel in!
I remember seeing this car in Frankfurt in 2017 at the IAA, it was breathtaking and still is!!
Amazing car
shitty top gear without clarkson honestly
Is the f1 engine a v6?
optional magnesium wheels as standard.......?🤔
Let’s all agree he never disappoints us with his content. 🙏❤️
I'd rather prefer a Redbull/Honda one .
"Lets start with the engine." proceeds to not mention the engine AT ALL
Does it have DAS?
NO TECHNOLOGY CAR.   F1 LOSER MERC NEED INTERNATIONAL HELP.
Awesome
If it does not have a clutch pedal and manual gears why bother making it ? I enjoy driving a car myself, not letting computers do most of the work.  And does it have toxic lithium rechargeable batteries, where I live we are not supposed to throw out even 1 AA rechargeable cell into the trash because its so toxic. Does this Merc have lots of them ?  I would love a manual gears V12 like the T50 by Gordon Murray cars, but unfortunately he already sold out the 100 cars before the launch. I wish he would make a few more.
Any Koenigsegg, besides being more beautiful, leaves this Mercedes behind in both top speed and acceleration.
So many haters talking about obsolete V12 engines in other models 😂 They are all sold so no one is forcing you to buy one
I'll still take 992 gt3  touring over any road car. Value for money
Ugly. Complicated. Political Committee-Specified Junk.
very similar to a swedish hypercar design....😁
So this is the Benefactor Krieger…
Goes to show just how far removed an F1 engine is from say a sweet Porsche engine that'd serve you for decades. I don't see the appeal of having that complicated engine in a road car. They didn't even bother firing it up and giving us a sound test, which says a lot..
I still waiting recompensation  No reason to be happy anything new until it not be proceeded
I don't think I've ever seen an uglier car.
👏👏👏👏🏁🏁🏁🏁
It also has the livery the W13 should've had
Looks like their previous hypercar.. i dont even remember the name anymore
gt63s is 2.8 0-60 so it seems as if they csnt crack that 0-60 time even with 1k hp
I think the Mercedes F1 Team used it to test the engines they use. Not very legal if you ask me. I'm sure they were testing for eliminate reliability issues. That's what a road car needs, and that's why hardly see Mercedes fail
that weight is stupid.
I like AMG for having Dr. Lochmahr instead of a marketing dude.  Could have gone much deeper
0:50 Renault has done it over 20 years ago with his Espace F1. Some you can t tell us that it is the first road car.
where Jeremy?
im more excited about this car being in video games, Because i know i will never own one
Benz the best or nothing, the future of automobile
i am just buffled why i am so utterly underwhelmed? this looks like a mclaren with a rooster comb...  if  it wins le mans, it would become mildly interesting.   was it the presentation???
Productions being a bit hampered by me having 2 weeks off work! Sorry but dont worry I will be back next week 👍
Sorry to say but compared to some of the other hyper cars this looks like a bit of a munter! Que the discourse........
And there was me thinking that transport had to be motivated by saving the planets resources .  Oh silly me !!  This German machine is about as anti social as a Russian Tank rolling into London.  If a performance car is actualy wanted but not needed by the moronic selfish few, they ought to only be allowed to buy a classic car . And on that note , with the roads in this country so gridlocked that the speed limit of 70 mph simply cannot be achieved , I have to ask myself why in the name of Zeus's Butt Hole are cars being produced such as this awkward looking beast ? Its a throw back to an anti social society populated by ignorant lunatics ..   And one a final note,  If this car was doing some berserk speed on the public road and a bird or an animal or even a child got in its way ........y'all know what I mean .
wow modern and Battery 😀
Wawww
v Heee toe
this is not topgear... this is only gear
That's Knight Rider super pursuit mode right there 😄
Great to see merc and aston martin pioneering in F1 tec for the street
Cool and all but they're way late to the game.
wait, is it the W12 or W13 engine?
soooooo $3 million dollars and slower than a $150,000 luxury Tesla SUV. Oh dear. Right up there with the Aston Martin Valkyrie.
1.6
i'm waiting for AMG One Straight pipes
Porpoise included
A Koenisegg with 3 stars in front..all the same car.
does it porpoise down the straight? :p
They made the krieger.
Center fin reduces oversteer.
Air in the front wheel well causing lift, has been common knowledge since the mid 90's, and this guy says they figured it out in a wind tunnel... My @ss.
1.6 V6 hybrid in an F1 car - Oh come on The same 1.6 V6  hybrid in a road car - Good heavens.
Who cares????
T50 is a better car, in every way.
Real F1 engine can’t even be started at room temperature — so tight it is is built.
At that price, doesn't do 250, it's not worth 2.5 milllion.
god i could only imagine what the og trio would do with this car
CORRECTION:, there IS NOT two electric motors on the front axle. There IS one electric motor on each of the two front axles. Lol, and the Mercedes exec says the only mistake he made was the weight. Really promotes confidence in AMG...
F1 engine in normal day use car? Its like having 2 feet long P in 16YO kids. Its not gonna be having it max potential used. No normal highway or road will get to see what is the real car power/speed etc. Its so tasteful. 🤣🤣
OMG the front emblem is just hilarious
the real question is how do they do that paint job in the rear, nice Detail!!
**checks dogecoin account**      I’ll get the 2024 model year.
AMG stands for ALL MIGHTY GOD!
Lfa sound though
amazing
I’ve been waiting on Mercedes Benz to build a car like this since the CLK-GTR
Se oye cómo licuadora 😂
Can't find words 🤣 this shuttle is designed 2 go 2 where
The interviewer seemed so rushed and anxious. Almost cutting the guy off on his explanations. Hard to watch
But does it porpoise?
Can this race in gt world challenge?
2017 thats when they came out with a prototype wow time fly 😳
This Top Gear sux
I got $112.13 I’ll buy it if it’s enough.😂🤣
So..... a step behind Ferrari SF90?
This is legal?
Ain't that the Krieger
Still don't know why you would want one? I mean F1 engine is cool but I don't get the appeal of this car at all.
Phoning the insurance company for a quote,  its a 1.6 mate,  yeah its nippy .
If you use a 2.5M quid car to commute daily, I reckon you have neighbours within sights, doubt that wildlife would raise a concern. Silly interpretation.
I got three minutes in and stopped. It’s all overkill. It’s sickening. And the price makes me want to puke. That’s why I stopped watching. This isn’t for me in any way. No thanks.
I saw the car in dubai because I in Dubai yall
No way dudes brain isn't 25% bigger than the average human with a head that BIG!!!!WOW
Imagina Airton Sena com as máquinas elétricas?
My good buddy Manny Koshbin is getting one...
Looks like a Toyota Supra.
Oh so you never actually drove it? K…
Ironic how they’re showing it off at yas Marina…😭😭
I didnt know seb's checking out marcedes cars🤣
FASTEST CAR TO SEE JESUS
I thought there will be no more cars soon because of 2030 and only electric. Or all that is only an idea - not going to work.
So sad that most of these will never get driven. Looks like a heck of a vehicle to get on the track or the Autobahn.
Would a fully carbon body hurts the performance?
Still using electric steering. That's a fail in my book. Power is nothing without feel and feedback. Cars have turned into computers and that itself takes away the feel from the analog raw feedback we used to get from cars of the 90s and early 2000s. I mean cars need to be cars not computers on 4 wheels. I don't know why all companies are trying to outdo each other by introducing stupid 'Tech' in their cars 99% of which is actually pointless in a car especially the touchscreens and digital dials.
At that weight the driver aids will have to be turned up to 11 for a decent track time.
U WOT M8!?! 😮 1700kg!? I mean, the stopwatch won't lie, so I'll reserve judgement but that's only an instagram model lighter than a 15 year old Nissan GTR and I'm sure someone in Stuttgart could also sneeze on a now-10-year-old 918 and end up with a better power to weight ratio as an AWD hybrid.  I'm sure this will be very quick, but it seems like we need some weight wars vs. horsepower wars with these hybrid and EV entries.
This video would be better with Jeremy Clarkson
أول عربي مغربي شاهدها ✌😅
hmm.... cheaper, faster, and V8, I think Ferrari SF90 is way more better than this.....
CLEARLY GC
Mata lampu depannya mirip karoseri bis indo
The head of the project is as aerodynamic as the car itself, if not more !
Definitely the car I’m gonna get when I move out of my parent’s basement.
It's going to be built in the UK??   Pass.
is it going to be on Gran Turismo 7?
If brabus get their hands on this it's gonna be all over
Nice
Does Valtteri get one? 🤔😀
Would be interesting to see the amg1 competing with the aaton martin valkryie wich is almost 500kg lighter, my money is on the aston for sure
Can't wait to watch Chris Harris thrash this thing
Great video til this English guy shows up and starts talking.
Almost as fast as my dad running away haha…ha…ahhh….ah.
Bad Ass!
Does anyone have problem with the fact that most footage of this car is CG and not the actual car? I know I do.
for what it is... it will sound no where as good as some other cars... but thats not the strong point of the 1.6L v6 turbo hybrid, is it...
I'm gonna soup up my old Chevy Vega, go out there and take it.
Why does the presenter seem to be so unprepared for this interview? Too many pauses, too many “umm”, one sided camera angle, definitely not the quality expected from top gear.
850.000€ service after 50.000km on the clock, and 1700 kilograms. Honestly this car might’ve been impressive in 2017, but not today. Acceleration times also not really anything mind blowing.
Amazing.
cannot wait to see it out on the streets!
I only care about the 100000 mile review.
There's only one One and it's a Koeniggsegg
Crap car
AMG One Wolverine lol MB never disappoints  Excellent job Marco beautiful ride Looks like a lot of fun to drive That rear end is sexy Front end reminds me of the beauty of the gt40 no diss  Gt40 still one of the prettiest vehicles ever made  The cabin is perfection
Imagine buying this car and never touch the racetrack🤣
You almost convinced me there, but no thanks, I'll stick to my 2010 Ford Fiesta.
I’m so lucky to own this car it truly is great …even If it is only lego.
imagine BRABUS touching this car!
At least I have money to pay for internet to watch these videos
Why do I get Porsche design vibes from this car?
I feel sorry for Marco who is articulate and professional, the presenter is painful to watch, tries so hard to be a lad, makes so many mistakes and presumptions….talks to much and asks so many terrible questions….what happened to the TG scripting ? The TG chemistry and just general knowledge and likeable banter ?
ive got a formula one car and a monster truck. no such thing as second place. 99.99 percent of the time i drive my 4 banger car.
Dont for get, when u get a flat tire. Your gonna need a tow because the car dosent have a spair. Engineers were too cheap to implement a spair. And run flats are useless.
its butt ugly
In the future people will call this era the UTERLY STUPID car era
What's in the engine bay. Sheesh. Bonet gets no luv.😁🫣💯🎯
If I purchase this fine vehicle will I get to hear Lewis complain about the tires every 15 minutes over any internal speakers the car may have?
Man, get a new jacket.....
It's very likely Mercedes and AMG had to put their heads together to find a way to make an F1 engine practical for a street car. I want to assume there was a lot of detuning involved all among other things
Weight saving, aero Mercedes badge 😂
Let's see Lewis Hamilton do a qualifying lap in this car!!!
I was actually looking into trading in my 2004 Ford Fiesta for this car. Thank you for the video, just ordered my AMG ONE.
Let’s face it: nobody is going to drive this on “highway mode”. Track mode all the way 🤪
0-100 3sec. 0-200 in 7sec. 1700 Kilos. These numbers seem very bad for what it should have been.  They said 1200 kilo and 0-200 under 6sec. That is not even close, it’s another dimension.
Those air Maxx.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎯💯♥️
slower ans heavier than the 918 and sf90 stradale 👍👍👍👍👍
Is this model prone to porpoising aswell ? 😅 hope not
why not v10?
Gm T50 for me all day son.
My claim to fame - I am the person who is building the high voltage cabling for this beauty. It's quite an honour really, to know that part of this beast has my personal touch within it.
Ve hi cle indeed.  Great machine
I’m looking for a small car for my daughter.  2 hours in the crapper , some man maths and “what can I get for an extra £500” budget creep I’m now configuring a AMG One but I’m worried that it only has 4 electric motors, I think I may need 5
Ueberkompliziert
I would like to change my answer to the question: What would you do if you hit the lottery?
What a cool weehickle
pls unlock your watch
Dear Santa,
The tech is amazing but it looks mediocre
I'll stick with my t4
Good reborn CLK GTR
Lol weight saving for an emblem…
THIS WILL KILL ALL ON A RACE TRACK EVEN A P1 OR A SENNA
Wow I want see performance of this
I wonder if it has porpoising issue 🤣🤣
Ludwigsburger Kennzeichen sin es eifach
you didnt start it just to hear it? also how long before a full engine rebuild?
Not to sure just how relevant this machine is now really.. shame
IT would be cool in Leman
...not interested...
Here we go again with the “formula1 engine” in a road car
sweet sweet car maybe 10 of them will see the track
They put a lot into this car, especially in safety testing. I am thinking the unfortunate tragedy of Paul Waker in his Porsche 918 did not go unnoticed by te car industry, It just seems like no matter who built the car, the safety systems got improved or a makeover so the nanny could drive the car if she had to.   Mercedes build quality when they get around to it. And it seems like the Big Wigs at Daimler-Benz were very insistent that the average huan being be able to drive this car like it was normal if they had to. They separated road from track - a brilliant strategy - and I 'd be curious about whatever else in the way of suspension technology and even amenities inside the car they thought they could get away with.   And I thought that Mercedes-McLaren was something else! Next time it will have a JATO pack or something on it!
Would love to see Stig drive the course on this. Will it be the fastest?
Those eyebrows tho
It’s an ugly car.
Lol, adjustable steering column is genius? 🙄🤦🏻
Overpriced 🥱. Overhyped. Jaguar CX 75 is way better and much cheaper. Sadly it didn't go in production.
doesnt look like a mercedes
Fair play to Mercedes for achieving this, even though it’s taken so long… must admit though, it looks horrendous & rather pointless.
and has the same turn signal switch as a c class.
No Chris Harris? Not interested
F1 engines run with different octane fuel than that available at a petrol station Would be interesting to know how an F1 engine has been adapted to run with ordinary octane fuel.
ONLY 1700 kg😂😂😂😂its already outdated.
I wish Jeremy clarkson had rated this!!
Do a drag race against the Mclaren 765 lt
Endless hours of design only to be destined to a few showrooms of the rich never to be driven or see the sunlight again... 😔
I want to see this car on Jay leno's garage.
NO AMG BUT OMG  ;-) :-O GEORGUS !!!  :-)
Very nice Vee-Hi-kle :)
This car is better in Forza Horizon 5
Looks like the maclaren F1 from the 90s.
If you get a ticket will they sack the police?
Front sticker looks very tacky and cheap lol why didn’t they just put a solid Mercedes symbol there?
Im so disappointed that my boss cancelled his order in the beginning of this year. Would been the only AMG Project 1 here in Sweden.
Incredible automobile video though it is not a "Top Gear" video, it misses its spirit, only facts! And that is sad... that being said a great presentation of this incredible car!
Wow - very impressive. Although as a Lotus fan, with this weight it is a tank.
I uh... couldn't figure out why this was the first super/hyper car I've seen in more than 20 yrs that actually interested me.  Very elegant design, function meets form finally in it's own category.  What a wonderful machine.
He is the chief engineer and he doesn’t know how effective the DRS is??? Not good enough.
This is what will make the future AMG cars in a new level. I still remember when Porsche came up with the 918 and how inheritance was great throughout their race cars after.
Show the engine!
The combination of petronas stickers is very perfect with Mercedes petronas and Mercedes cannot be separated ... this petronas oil is from Arabia to which country can I get info I don't know
See if you can do a shot everytime he says W-ehicle.... 🤣🍻 then try and say max wertstappen is wery good at driving his wehicle in wancouver.
so when its going to be a proper safety car and not slowing the f1 cars?
there are 4550 models in the world, and this brand is responsible for almost half of what the standard from those are. thats pretty good.   they are given the task by God, to take up all car and vehicle building in the world.   they should continue and keep improving.
Just wow 👌
It seems like we, the people, will never be impressed. Almost all of us here certainly don't own the car, nor would even come close to owning one. I feel like money talked its way in and out of the conversation. If someone wants to make a proper road going F1 car, Matt Amys made a video going over where to buy one, and then looking up your local regulations, and registering it as a kit car.
Am MGU H & K!! I’d switch out the wheels and tires though to the previous Gen F1 wheel and tire dimensions for better grip and forgiveness in taking turns at high speeds.
Customized Patta Air Max 1's ?
Very normal for today standards kinda sad
The car has a 0-100 of 2.9 seconds... I REALLY like the design and the technical know-how that went into production here but the 0-100, 0-200 and 0-300 times are really disappointing when you compare it to the 918 for example... and the 918 was first produced in 2013..
looks cool but I think I'll stick with my peugeot 208
I love how supercars have got so fast now, that nobody even cares about the times anymore.
Ah yes, Strat 2 and the century of poles it achieved. Amazing that they included all that.
Why are all the global brand ads essentially the same.
Overrated!
The smile on Jacks face tells it all, this car really is a dream car.  Great great video.
I love the design of this car. What a machine!
Pls be the safety car in F1, pls!
Looks like a crossover between koenigsegg and Bugatti
"You're ONE ugly Mercedes-Benz"  P.S. SLR McLaren #️⃣☝🏽
2.9 to 100? That's underwhelming.
Looks like a mc20 a bit
But can it do a backflip?
Ohhh, that is pure beauty!
Nice car, but my real question is where's that lovely jacket from Jack?
What a magical car.
Lecky cars won't last
Could jack ixx replace paddy ?
I never in a million years believed I would have jealousy pangs against my dream machine the AMG GT and yet here we are.....
The Mercedes logo on the front looks hideous.
*wet fart sound*
Nico Rosberg leans in......
if it has the engine of the 2022 f1 Merc engine well then even a toyota pruis is gonna be faster hehehehe
It is incredible how the Italians are able to make such beautiful cars. But Mercedez is not italian. Exactly. Any cheap Lambo looks better than this .
How is the porpoising though?
Well it isn't really an F1 engine at all, F1 inspired, but far from an actual F1 engine. It's too heavy doesn't rev nearly as high and seems little more than a marketing gimmick.
This video did not feature Clarkson, Hammond or May. It's a failure in my book.
I think vw could develop a special software for you to meet the emission limits. I heard someone say, that the software can tell if you're on the street or track. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Merc's original claims like 1:1 power to weight ratio, 0-200 in under 6 seconds were all a lie after all. Overpromise and underdelivered. Such a disappointment.
Another level this car...😯
I love the new design language of many new cars and super/hypercars that MB is implementing.
The way he says vehicle sounds like a fraggle rock character
This has more to do with a cynical marketing effort than the embodiment of petrolheads' dream
2 plus million dollars and they use the blinker stock out of a C class 🤔
I am sorry for the massive effort that had been put into this project but this is just the biggest automotive facepalm ever in car history. It’s not the fastest on a track (that’s the Valkyrie), it’s not the prettiest (Pagani has you covered), it’s not the fastest accelerating (Bugatti), it’s not the most practical (T50) it’s not the best sounding (LFA, Aventador, T50, Valkyrie, in fact ANY other hypercar sounds better) and it’s not the most brutal (Bugatti Bolide). To top it it has the same badge as my last taxi ride.  But most importantly, when people asked for a F1 powered street car they weren’t thinking of a 1.6 liter hybrid….they were thinking of a freakin’ V10 for god’s sake…
219mph? hmm that was the slowed down Brabus Mercedes SL years ago. With 730hp. 😊
Kudos to Mercedes-AMG for taking this on and delivering!  What a machine.
Didn't even turn it on what a shame
so 20-30 years later we are using new technology to make a car look like a mclaren f1 that is actually slower than a car made 20-30 years ago??????????????
The Hennessey Venom is reasonably zippy too.
Was ist die  leasingrate?
I believe Nico Rosberg was one of the first to order one of these
Ordered mine yesterday, can't wait to get it!
😮 🤐 😯
Can it also do porpoising ?
Are those the biggest NACA scoops ever fitted to a vehicle?
Imagine turning up at the lights with this, and being beaten to 60 by a Tesla with 4 people sat comfortably in it...
It's a very nice weehicle!
Great, another millon dollar hypercar which will end up in a garage and die there. sad stuff.
Bet it doesn’t sound like a 6.3 V8 😞
Its not a F1 car ots maybe a F3 car..... slower then a 918
Too expensive too ugly too slow too late to the party
I was hoping it was going to have an engine based off the musically sounding V10s in F1 from 20 years ago. This thing's V6 sounds like hot garbage.
Going to be interesting to see what kind of  lap times this thing lays down? Not pretty. Looks like it will definitely be dangerous though?
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.        .!
“Formula 1 technology brought to the streets” it says. Why? Streets should be safe and are shared- not a playground for speed maniacs.
Geil 🤩
I hate that stupid fin thing..looks like something from whacky races..be a much nicer looking machine, without that fin !
Honestly not really impressed with this. It's ugly, heavy and not overly fast.....(In terms of acceleration) Bit disappointing.
*The way that spoiler comes out* 😍
How's the porposing on it? 🤣
Next safety car ! plis !!!
Start it up then.
It should be the next f1 pace car
Yeah been waitin on this one.
We miss clarkson , we want those old lads to review this cars………..they make it more interesting 🙂
Just imagine the human brain power that was involved in the creation of this thing.  Before you start commenting, just think about that for minute, because all it takes is one moron to criticize something he knows nothing about.
Cars like these need to be exempt from emissions regulations. These cars are not going to be mass produced and will make up such a small % of cars on the road.  it would be interesting to see what is truly possible in terms of speed.
Is the porpoising included?
The T.50 weighs 986 kilo. This weighs 1700 Kilo!  why? another SLR McLaren for Mercedes.
Cor, that Mercedes guy was so stiff, painful to watch
Only took them 9 years to copy a McLaren P1, good job Mercedes 😄
Let Chris drive it!
Meanwhile GM rocks up with a high rev v12 and 400kgs less...this car makes no sense
its v6 f1 engine meh. make v10 f1engine with todays technology it would be very special car for long time.
Brabus is writing ....
it's been out on Forza horizon 5 for over 6 months now and they only just finished the real life car?
Ferrari 296 GTB: 830 horsepower...CO2/149 grams...top speed 330km/h. Sorry Mercedes but you loose.
Do not give the keys to Richard Hammond 🤪🤪
I would love to try that car. So AWESOME ... it’s like a wet dream comes true, yea?
More junk for the planet
The whole point of using a F1 engine is that it's small and light, but can still produce huge amount of power at high revs. Now the car is 1.7 ton, the engine is more of a gimmick rather than a performance deliverer. Serious, no one drives this even in Forza.
piece of shit car for the money
Hand painted star? Really? Not just a decal? Guys... not sure if I should clap or shake my head....Smarter people than me (everyone)... could you please explain?
After seeing the AM Valkyrie- most other cars now look like they’ve not been that well thought out . No doubt the Merc will be fast but I reckon the Valkyrie is faster around the track .
Enjoy 😉 😁😎 https://youtu.be/Kp2BrbqcKtM https://youtu.be/hp5jzN3H14c https://youtu.be/Bk9z1Y2AiXg
What a disappointment. Gets dropped by a tesla, looks awful and costs a fortune. Might as well buy a 720s for a tenth of the price and experience the same acceleration and is better looking or a Pista. I own a Mercedes and am really disappointed.
I have this car in forza.. it was very expensive to buy
Took long enough
Not worthy of being on the cover of Forza Horizon 5 - should have been the Valkyrie.
Would be amazing if they actually raced it....
This bloke sounds like that long question  guy in F1 press conferences
I was hoping Clarksons voice yuck this is awfull lol
Wasn't this done a looong time ago already? That Renault minivan
£2.4m and 4 years for a car that'll be pushed by a Tesla 😅
13,000 left to go
Those motors are so huge and heavy compared to Lucid's motors which are smaller and have 600hp. What the hell, mercedes? Is this really the pinnacle of innovation?
CARRIED the engineering guy in his own interview smh
i've been waiting since 2018 for this beaut. I'd still get the gt3 rs weissach 23 over this anyday but mercedes has done an  exceptional job at putting together this great piece of machinery!. The higher rpm reserve really sells this bad boy.
"the horsepower wars are getting a bit silly." *I STRONGLY DISAGREE!*
I’m sorry but you sound just like james from throttle house 😭😭😭
What about watter intake through airports to the engine when raining 🤔?
or you can just buy a c8 ZO6 for a fraction of the price and get the same specs
Sub 7 min at the Ring?
All that carbon and modern tech and it still weighs 1700kg? I'd much rather have a 700kg car with less power and less tech.
I never understood People thinking 0-100km/h (0-60mph) is a good indicator of Performance.  You see that a lot with People who compare a Tesla S Plaid with any Car that is close to or a few milliseconds slower from 0-100km/h (0-60mph) than a Tesla Model S Plaid. Of course the Tesla won't be that powerful going to even higher Speeds nor will it be able to consistenly for an Hour or more take such Speeds without Issues nor will it take a heavy Beating on a Track. Or since i'm German, on the Autobahn where driving over 200km/h (120mph) for an Hour or more consistently isn't too rare. That's what matters more regarding Performance Is the Tesla faster to 100km/h (60mph) than a lot of Cars? Yes. Will it perform consistently for long Times as in my examples above? No.  TL;DR: 0-100km/h (0-60mph) Numbers get more Focus in Performance Talks than it should. Prost & Cheers from the Bavarian Alps
No pirelli rubbish here. Michelin only!
❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
This just makes Gordon Murray look even more like a genius
Wee-hicle 🤣
Ordered one in black
The best way to invest your money🙃
I saw this car at IAA last year. Frankly speaking, it did absolutely nothing for me. In person, it looks like a blobfish with a mohawk. Also the weight and power figures are quite disappointing. The Valkyrie is on another level of ethos and purity and I am pretty sure it will destroy the Project One on the track.
One thing I did read about the AMG one was, after 30k miles the engine requires a rebuild.  I'm amazed they can get a road version of an F1 engine to last that long!
0-60 in 2.9s. Hardly ground breaking is it? 11 miles on its electric power alone... An overpriced, over engineered disappointment. A Tesla plaid would destroy it. The closest thing to an F1 car is certainly not this. 1700+kg!!! 😂
Looks cool, not sure about a 6-cylinder engine. Might pick one up to do an LS swap on.
all of that money and thought just to have a painted mercedes decal on the hood...
I hope it does not suffer from porpoising!!! 😉
probably only 5 owner will drive the car on the track the rest will keep this car in a garage
Anyone know where this was filmed?
I just wanna drive it one time.😂
Just a ugly desing and compared to a Koenigsegg Jesko miles behind in high-tech.
All that craziness and the 0-60 is slower than a Plaid.
god it looks so crappy in streetmode, thats just the downside of adding a racemode. the gap between the wheels and the chassis are way too big when its not lowered.
Nice car, but I am more intrigued by this "weheatle" he speaks of.
‘1063hp isn’t actually that much’ 🤣
The mirrors are like 🐌 eyes 💩
This car is 4 years too late 🤷🏻‍♂️ t.50, Valkyrie and jesko will smoke it.
Too ugly to sell?
Manufacturers: F1 is there to push the technology forward. One day all that tech will trickle down to everyday cars...  People: So why don't you give us the tech now?  Manufacturers: Give us 5 years to put F1 engine in a 2.7 mil car...  ...:P
Thanks god you review it before super car blonde
I'm sure Hamilton is also happier to have a true hyper car as a road car.
Not at all a lightweight vehicle, unfortunately.
Shame Mercedes are shit in this year’s F1.
Benefactor Kruger
Should of put the driver seat in the middle like a McLean F1.  It’s not the f1 experience 😅 yeah it has the engine. But come on!
bruh idk how to express my feeling for this car everyday at school i annoy  my freinds with it i sleep dream and think about it its such a masterpiece and im glad it is now here f1 tech on streets :0 crazy
Yes, please.
Anyone remember Spyhunter on Xbox! This car looks so similar 😎
-What you think AMG One can offer more than its competition? -It has aerodynamics and driving modes....  My Ford Puma 1.0 125ps has driving modes also....
Heavy. And pretty much delayed for a "based on our F1 car" tag. Mercedes is not winning any races, but most probably all cars would have been sold by now.
Hope they resolved the Porpoising issue for this One?
OMG that Petronas green on the seatbelts
Does this car porpoise? Asking for a friend
Mercedes AMG-One would be following as a greatest F1-inspired hypercars after McLaren F1 and Ferrari LaFerrari. 🔥🔥❤🇬🇧😍
Is there a Red Bull version though?
Not worth the price im sorry its just not
what a great time to be a billionaire
What is a weehickle?
What is the fastest growing market segment? Luxury you say?
still sounds like a UPS truck
Yes I am biased, but man, Mercedes and AMG know how to push the ball ahead... This is absolutely wild! We are desensitized to things in general because there is so much going on that is incredible, 1,000hp is not even crazy anymore... but it actually IS lol and this build is special!
This is one of those cars that makes you think this batch will be referred to pre war cars
Krieger 💪
Is that Bugatti with a body kit?  Side profile is uncanny!
Ugly!!
Why does it look so shit though?
Thats one really, really ugly car!!!
you will never see one on the street
This car should totally be the safety car btw
Looks like a batmobile
As someone who dislikes Mercedes because of being a key player in the 25 year import ban in the USA, I got to give credit where credit is due, this is one beauty of a car!
0-100 in 2.9 😂😂😂 For an electric shit 😂😂😂 An expensive shit...  Way cheaper with a Nissan GTR R35  0-100 in 2.9 sec.
For someone at this level, the host sure is asking some pretty dumb questions. "so you don't just stick these vents and intakes somewhere around here and hope for the best". Yes, cos for a £2.4m car, that's exactly what they would do. Germans are renowned for not doing any calculations and just sticking stuff together and "hoping for the best".
Should put Petronas logo as Mercedes using the green Petronas colored stripe
Its not as cool as the clk-gtr
all that to hear one of the worst sounding F1 engines ever produced.. golf claps
Pretty cool car.
More useless cars
Id commute with this enviornmently friendly electric hybrid
👌👏👏👏👏👏🤗❤
I would like to order 1 steering wheel please:) that's about all I can afford 😅
I can´t wait what Manny will do with this amazing machine!!!! :D I was in that car two years ago at one car show, you feel like you sit on the road! :D
"Finished" is a strong word! Anyone in the automotive world from an R&D or build tech background knows how much of a pig this will still prove to be!
I'm a little confused by it, personally. The T.50, Valkyrie, F5, Chiron etc have all shown "bigger numbers" with conventional ICE engines, and the Nevera, Battista and Evija are all superior "next gen" electric hyper cars that push into a whole new performance bracket. I get the USP is "F1 engine in a road car"... but these engines are probably regarded as the least involving, most over-complicated, worst sounding engines F1 has ever seen.
I wish they would add one red logo for Niki Lauda as on their F1 cars
It’s a cool fast car, but for $2.4M car, couldn’t they actually have a proper dashboard and gauges?! Instead of 2 crappy out of place iPads on the dash?! 🤷🏻‍♂️🤔
This is a stupid buy Even for a billionaire or millionaire.  The Range is stupid!  There are now so many hypercars with almost twice as much horsepower and enough range to get you back to a charge port.  Amg does not equal the best of the best.
Fins are back from the art deco era!
I don't think this is going to be as fast as some assume it will be. I think some production cars will be faster around the Nürburgring.
Why are you showing me heaven when I'm gonna be stuck on purgatory?!!
"2nd half of 2022" did i hear that right?
very soon every car will be a boring junk of metal filled witd lcd displays. just ugly.
Why is this AWD?   F1 cars are RWD.  No need to add the cost, complexity, and weight.    Power operated steering column?  Swing and a miss.
Meh, give me the Hennessey F5 plus, I'll save enough to buy a new beach house!
Thanks Top Gear for in-depth review, I was so confused b/w AMG ONE & Toyota Corolla.
Just im gonna say اللهم أرزقنا ياااا☝️ااارب
I remember they said this car can reach 0-200 in 6 seconds, but now is 1 second slower, its a little bit pity. And the weight might be the main factor. I hope it can beat SF90 or model S plaid in the drag race. Right now seems very hard.
"When Hamilton car was fast" Ahh I see
What’s a weh-HEE-cle?
Take a shot every time one of them says “Formula One”
Pointless, bet very few will be driven in anger. People like Shmee will buy one, #Mr beige trousers and wrap it PPF, #joke. It’s nothing like an F1 car. If you want a race car, then buy a race car 👍
FH5 graphics are nice
Forza
Can’t wait to see this weehickle on the track
Only one thing I can't shake my mind off...that printed mercs badge on the nose. Makes the 2.4 mil pounds car look 2 pounds....
Top ❤ car🎉
Does it Porpoise?
Intro song is Diatribe - Oliver Michael
Seem like a chiron, but have an corvette shape, and with some huracan style. What do you think?
There are Merc AMG for 2.4mil and.... there are honda's k24 making 1000hp and with just enough valve float not to destroy itself for a fraction of the cost hahaha
Does it include porpoising?
Ayoo !!Forza horizon 5 reference
These endless, ever more boastful horsepower figures are a complete and utter bore. They really are.
£2.4m for a car that's still weaker than a Bugatti Chiron, barely more powerful than a Veyron...absolutely nowhere near the likes of a Lotus or a Rimac.  Still slower than a Chiron, much lower top speed. Not as good as an Aston Martin Valkyrie either...  I think the price tag is extreme for a car that will be outpowered by next gen (or current gen Tesla) family EV cars.  I was looking forward to the first ever German trio hypercar..but I'm quite disappointed with the stats on paper  As for the looks..its OK I guess. Nothing too special. The entire car just feels like a gimmick
I wonder if this will bounce down the straights the same as the F1 car does?
Again with the unnecessary music; we clicked for the cars, not the soundtrack.
You could have this or an overpriced kit car from Texas called Hennessey....
Its amazing stuff!
Imagine scratching that merc star on the hood lmaoooo
what in the koenigsegg gemera
I hope Top Gear works with Nico, when he takes delivery of his for a production release and review.
Looks more like a lotus than a mercedes
Finally a worthy opponent to my Ethanol Celica T-Sport ;)
At 1700kg this thing is quite the porker. That’s ~300 and ~450 kg more than P1 and LaFerrari respectively with similar power. I expect this AMG One to be faster but still.   On paper the Valkyrie is just a far more exciting project with more horsepower, weighing 400kg less, and wilder aero. Which is faster is tbd.
this runs on liquid arrogance
No Michael no! It's not fair Michael!
I will take the roadster 2.0 for 25 times less and its quicker in every way and get 400-600miles out of a tank..
Great car, weird review
He didnt drive it
im suprise this host can make the very exciting car look so boring..mazel tov
Best Mercedes ever just wow
this car will sit in a lot of skyscrapers
2:10 my man actually said 1000hp is not enough 💀💀💀 get lost m8 seriously
Road going hoover
Acceleration figures are very underwhelming for a 4 wheel drive 1000 bhp + track car. 0-124 mph in 7.0 seconds is slower than a Mclaren Senna.
Strat 2!!! Yes!!! This car is insane.
Pit lane limiter!?!? I NEED that!!!
So this is running 100 go less than the Valkyrie and weighs 700 kg more?!!! Man I thought this may give it a run for it’s money but no way that happens
Impressive
Mercedes messed up. I mean, it's cool but how do you know where the DRS zones are when you're out driving?    : )
Congrats Mercedes-AMG, great job. Meanwhile in Munich BMW and their M Division are working on how to make their cars even uglier.
The carwow video on the same car is much more interesting tbh.
I will order one. Maybe two so I have spare parts.
xQc will react to this.
I'm guessing most of them purchased by Sheiks who'll drive it around Dubai Autodrome once a year ...
merc logo is just a lame sticker?
Disappointing that it's such a porker
Not very pretty and a bit heavy. I should buy the G.M. T50 instead. (before I wake up)
Wow this looks terrible  Hennessy Venom for the win 🏆
Worst commercial I've seen. This is not journalism its commercial and the car is not driven. The likes of Koenigsegg and other hypercar manufacturers have passed this car in the 5 years its been in the AMG workshops trying to figure out how to make something so stupid as an street car with warranty have an Formula 1 engine........
Just get a litre bike if you really want that speed 🤣 not all of us have 2.7 mil for this amazing jem
can it compete with koenigsegg jesko? no
Service after 50k kilometers or 31k miles is a mere 850k Euros lol, and then the thing is not even as quick as a 765LT in a straight line hahaha...gotta be a rocket on the circuit to compete with Valkyrie
So no talk on the engine itself. Hiw far away is this car still??. I'd be pissed if there were no real details and had bought a bucket of bolts. For that money
When do we get to see some performance comparisons of these crazy hypercars?  Been waiting years.  Even to compare to some existing cars like the P1 etc.
A friend was fortunate enough to secure one of the last chassis numbers. So proud of him.
With that price tag an ridiculous exclusivity Mercedes are doing Tesla a favour by making the s plaid look like a bargain based on the 0-60 time's, at 2m pounds it should be doing it in 2.0 flat!!! Too heavy, I doubt it will beat the Valkyrie, the t50 or the jesko
I Remember when i saw the prototype in Frankfurt in 2017 and in that moment i thought that the idea to put an f1 engine in a Road car was insane....and now it's real .
MERCEDES AMG ONE-KOENIGSEGG ONE   My dream cars
2 dollar sticker on the hood of a multi million car LOL
The AMG One is not going have porpoising issue right? lol...   All jokes aside...I am Merc fans, but it's quite frustrating with how they are not able to get around the porpoising issue and challenge Redbull and Ferrrai... :(
Hate the look of the rear. But what a technical masterpiece
Reminds me a bit of the Lotus GT1
Hope this car does not have porpoising issues like the w13
Such a great looking car.
too much...i prefer dallara stradale manual gearbox
Can anyone please share the tune code?
So it's like a Gordon Murray car you can actually buy?
that spoiler splitter situation ruins the design. Even if I had the opportunity I wouldnt buy this just on that alone
Does the horn make a "bono my tyres are gone" sound?
It's a bit ugly really
If koenigsegg and Mclaren had a baby.
brrr
Where is the Mercedes DNA ? It looks like a random supercar !
1600cc??
from the US here. but just wanted to say basically any service done on this car without any warranty or special packages etc, your body is used as currency. naturally after the 2.4 million? impressive. it reminds me of the AMG CLK GTR
That sick Mercedes project one
This or Civic with a laptop ?
RedBull will buy it, definitely
Ok, I see you Mercedes 😉
Only about 10 years of waiting for this thing....
This car looks discussing, shit design
So who is gonna buy this car ?
Really cool car, really glad it exists, but a bit of a failure from AMG in my opinion. All the fuss about an F1 engine in a road car, 5 years to develop, all for it to only have run of the mill performance numbers. And 1,700KG? Amazed I heard that right...need to take a leaf from GMA, that's just ridiculously heavy.
nice it has the mercedes f1 livery
I like how serious journalist are done with the figures and numbers battle.  how can magnesium wheels be an option? 😂 who hasn't chose them
Does it come with porpoising??
in hypercar world, this looks average.  mostly just the front end and the boring paint job... could be improved easily
2.4 million and you have to pay extra for magnesium wheels, no idea what the germans are smoking but I think they need to calm down on it
Some day I will make enough money to own a Mercedes weehicle.
And guess what? The Tesla Plaid would still destroy it...
I was going to purchase one, but the shark fin reminds of the 1960's batmobile. Hard pass. Mercedes A series, here I come.
A 2 tonne Chiron is faster? How is this so heavy? I remember them saying 1200kg when in the early stages, now nearly 1700kg.
Looks awesome. I am an AMG driver. But 1700kg?! And can't help but it feels a bit LaFerrari, P1, 918 like. So the new Astons, Koenigseggs or Lotus for example gone one step further I think.
Why put this out when I can't buy one.  Such a tease :-)
The amount of F1 tech in this is car is SEXO.
At least it’ll look good locked up in car collections…..
why the hell is this video so god damn loud relax with the volume while editing or are y'all deaf there?
It's very heavy! didnt expect that.
this is kinda like the same concept with the 300 Uhlenhaut SLR, streets body, f1 winning engine.
Wow what a car ,a well one can dream.I’d be so happy to see one on the road.
At this point, I'm not sure if the engineers accent is already a kind of trademark ("ze germans, sey do ze engineerings!") or really just the result of him 'only' being a good engineer and not being a spokesperson, too.
Hope it will be F1 safety car…
It took that long to make the car. It already looks outdated
Ok..im gonna get this ..skip lambo...😄
our customers
so F1 engines need to be preheated before they can be started cuz their gap tollerances are too precise.  I'd imagine they had to give some of that precision away for more easier to daily use
yes yes yes, the blonde hair guy, not the moody bald guy, real reviews, unbiased by stupid colours, chris is good with the feel of the car
This is a track car not for daily commuting, but i guess this is what the few that buy this will mostly do. Go to the mall and the fancy restaurants.
This is the most confused and underwhelming car on the current market. It has an F1 engine but weighs 1.7t dry, the reason why it weighs that much is because they decided to chase numbers that were impressive 6 years ago so they added all this bs electric stuff and made it AWD. It's a shame a great missed opportunity.
what a car
It’s nothing else than demonstration power . Power to just DO IT
Such a cool concept of implementing the F1 engine in a road car, but I am afraid they chose the wrong philosophy. A dry weight of 1.7 tonnes??? To add to that it is AWD, you are literally adding power just to overcompensate for the weight. If this was RWD and had a huge focus on aerodynamics like a Senna or a Valkyrie it would make so much more sense. Also, don't get me started on the front end, it looks like a catfish, and u can tell it is already getting outdated, I would sure hate it if I had to pay over 2mil GBP just to get screens from an A-class. It's a shame they had it in the bag and ruined it all up by chasing numbers that were impressive 6 years ago.
The best thing about the F1 engines is that they're unbelievably fuel-efficient and powerful for just a 1.6L engine. Interested to see if that's been carried over.
Still guaranteed to ''only'' 50000 kilometers ?
This would have been amazing in 2009.
Isn't f1 all about developing technology that would be inputed into a road car
Very dope car Mercedes !!!
Will be a maintenance nightmare like all Merc products and especially AMG variants are
That "extreme" position is called "error of project". That's why you don't have it on the amg one.
Slower than a tesla lolz
That's one of the ugliest Mercedes ice ever seen. I know its all for maximum performance but it doesn't even look like a Mercedes.  I'd sooner have an SLS or a lot of other fast Mercedes.
A review for a car that is not available anymore as it is sold out (to the rich). in the meantime it is a useless car for the society/humanity considering the times we are heading as it is just another powerful car that pollutes, uses a lot of fuel. We need innovation, efficiency - and also to be accessible for most of the people.
Who the hell put that jurnalist there?! He is more interested in uselese showoff options than a car itself. We need a motorhead in there to ask questions
this guy is so awkward
Funny a tesla can smoke this car anytime
It's a brilliant one, a bit late on design but seriously pretty. I love it. ridiculous price but then again what I would give to say 'I have an F1 engine in my car', that's priceless.
Imagine this German guy as a stand up comedian. What charisma. lol
Brilliant!.. It's nearly as ugly as their F1 car.
If anyone wants to give my a hypercar - -I'd rather have the T.50, over this or the Valkyrie, fyi.
a garage with this and the speed tail🔥👌 (winning)
goofy ahh car
Volvo much better looking
The Whicikle?…
Like any mercedes, it comes with branded badge but low in quality. Everything will fall apart or peel in less than 4 years.
Who buy these?
Damn, the front three stars logo may cost more than my car 🥹
oh shit, they finally made the asphalt mercades a thing
and then we gonna have these videos Tesla Plaid S owning this car too...
i wanna see this car become f1 safety car, there is no way driver still complain about SC move too slow
way too heavy and way slower than initially promised
I drive a Mazda 3, is this car a sensible upgrade?
A road with a f1 engine 👌🏽👌🏽This could be a hyper car entry for Le Mans Audi Porsche and Mercedes 🔥oh yea and Toyota
High priced golf cart
And it's a million miles from an F1 car.
Why don’t they show how the car drives, feels like? Instead you get a endless feature list that most don’t want to know. Looks cool, F1 engine and E Stuff, yeah I guess it’s fast. no sh#t sherlock
What a splendid machine
whats the point of fitting a small and light f1 engine when you then still are allmost 1700kg heavy.
This thing is 700kg over weight its insane. Their own GT Black series will beat this!
I heard Daimler is not happy about this money pit
Terrible presenter who keeps looking at his phone cos he’s clueless and gets facts wrong
So, does it have a knob for setting the level of porpoising you want? Say,. from light ripples, to mild bumps to severe bruises? 😂😂
That's is awesome 😍😍😍 hopefully BMW can come up with their own hypercar also.
Didn’t know they were still working on it..
The front reminds me of Shrek. Those mirrors should have been shorter
What in the bugatti ferrari!
Ok I would like to buy one. Where can I get the invite?
so each one is selling at a massive loss.
No drift mode
05:05 my guy going hard on the vegeta-cut!!
Best of all, porpusing is a main feature!
I want to see this at Nurburgring
Beautiful machine. I'm not a fan of Mercedes-Benz's designs, but this car keeps their design language in the cockpit area but makes it its own with unique lines and styling. Well done Mercedes!
Sounds bad, looks bad but is still an engineering masterpiece.
Harris please!!
🧢 if that’s a f1 motor that’s most bland sounding f1 motor of all time
F1 safety car righ there
What will they think of next?  Perhaps a one with wings?
could have done a better job at speaking but its understandable to be flabbergasted at this car
You can never have too much horsepower, but you can have too much torque. Too much torque and every time you hit the accelerator the tires break free & you lose control. The more horsepower you have the faster you can go & the quicker you can get to that speed.
Is it just me or does this look like a Toyota ?
You already know some dumbass rich kid is gonna use Strat 2 on the road and wreck into someone.
BENEFACTOR KRIEGER !!💪🏽🔥
Abu Dhabi and Dubai are in the same country. Lol
i hate mercedes but this car is amazing ... wow ..and always hate electric power of cours ..
Hmmm a car with an engine that they completely tear down and then rebuild after every race. Hmmm...
Horrible music in the start
Sexual.
looks like a botched corvette
It is  exactely like Alfa Romeo 4 c
Who else thinks the back is copy pasted from a koinseeg
This is a disappointment. 1000 something horsepower with basically for electric motors getting it to that height and the top speed is only 219? Mercedes is not the only one that dropped and F1 engine in their car. Ferrari did it with the F50, a down-tuned V 12 engine. Give me the Mercedes CLK GTR and the Hennessey F5 please
That is a nice wehicle
All sold out 😭 💪🏼 🤙🏼 https://youtu.be/PlY0Kh6jyFk
A car riddled with problems from start to finish. Already looks dated. I wouldn't be taking it on any long drives. Oh and the f50 already did the f1 engine and its far nicer. This just looks like a porsche gt1 from the 99s
Thx god for the german engineering
I've never heard anyone pronounce it "wehicle" lol.
Greta wehicle
They didn’t cover if it has adjustable lumbar support which makes me think it’s missing. Hard pass.
Bugatti beater?
i honestly wonder why it is "only" 2,9sec. it fells quite underwhelming knowing that the gt-r goes 3,5 or the gt63. also considering the fact that this uses 4 electric motors and being 4matic.
Boring Presenter
Topgear is shit
maybe you guys should start to in-moments-like-this interview actually who build it, the genius, who build it, and not someone who is afraid to make a mistake on what he memorized before interview
Great video always from top Gear bless up bro
Question... would a new engine not be cheaper to make?
The fastest super car in GTA V
Wow it's about time..thank God. I already have my order in
this top gear suck...
Strat 2, aka Party Mode
Mercedes : F1 powertrain Me: is it going to be a V12 Mercedes Its a V6 F1 engine Me: trumpet noises intensifies
the weight probably kills this car lol
already finish and already sold out about a year ago😂
Really  awesome  car i compare  it to the Porsche  918 spider   just a timelss car it will look like a new car even  in 20 years
your sneakers🔥👌
What a beautiful veHIIIcel 😆
What's the point of this video if you guys are not going for a test drive? perhaps it might persuade me to reserve for the next batch that will be produced since its already sold out.
Hey look, its another car I will never see in person, and will never own... if you never see it, and never own it, does it really exist?
This would have been epic 5 or 6 years ago.
Amazing engineering. Visually an absolute mess. Hopefully that can be sorted out with the right spec.
Ve-H-icle hahH
id prefer a classic Ferrari MOMO steering wheel. This is not a F1 car...
me love - me adore = ME LOVE ME ADORE - ALL THE RESPECT - A SUPER CAR BY ALL MEANS - I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE CALL INNOVATIVE ENGINEERING ,,,  Combustion Engine - THANKS
Imagine buying this thing then a 1100hp supra pulls on you on autobahn
Stunning car , I would love one
It's a cool car, but I prefer Gordon Murray's T.50.
17:12 People that bought this car don't have neighbours. 🤣
Tesla Model S Plaid still smokes it i bet
Woooooo, this is a monster on the road
den ser rigtig godt ud
good to see that mercedes has finally provided us with the ultimate definition of: ugly.
Friggin ugly and of course most will never even see a road let along a track.
We need Clarkson to be doing this.
looks terrible
Now get the stig in it.
Amazing machine by mercedes !
So f1 drivers can't complain about the safety car being too slow anymore
No test drive? No exhaust sound test at least? And why is the Editor become the Host? Asking too much weird questions, just shut up & drive. And please take off that stupid jacket, you are indoor.
Service price is going to be incredibly painfull even for those who can afford it. BTW what service schedule is?
A W E S O M E
Amazing wohikle yes?
alô paito, pode trazer já? kkk
Looks like an Audi rs7 from the back
When your car in trouble, box box
Impossible to dislike the technology but... can't help but notice that the overall aspect of charm for that thing was completely ignored and lived at the bottom of priorities. I think that sort of disdain can speak very loudly toward a very large sector of professionals in the automotive industry, and none of them are neither nice or respectful.
This is just what the world needs, petrol its Never been  more plentifull, never been cheaper, the environment  has not been healthier, speed limits have all been eradiicated Traffic is now almost non existent since our last nuclear war we had a 1000 years ego, its ALL great guys till population expansion for now we have more of everything we need expect faster cars we need More we need Faster 1.2 seconds to 100MPH is Not fast enough get then faster guys
Most people struggle to pay bills . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Then this.
1000 cc inline four engine, delivering 212 bhp at 14500 rpm for 198 kg wet, acceleration figures comparable, available for around 30k £,it is called the M1000RR, available at every BMW motorrad dealer.
Have they added any porpoising to bring you the full Mercedes F1 experience?
This reminds of the W08 Mercedes F1, it’s been almost 5 years now since this car was unveiled and now the production version is here. The whole car looks like a fish or some sort of a sea creature.
Great, a very expensive hypercar with a crappy engine noise 🧐
Look like McLaren F1
There goes the nurburgring record.
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
I’d love to see Clarksons take on this.
Honestly expected more from AMG One. Bit of a disappointment
As soon as I saw the Valkyrie I knew Mercedes wouldn’t be able to match it based on how long it was taking to put this car into production. I’m quite disappointed to know that it’s won’t be able to compete with the Aston Martin but nevertheless it’s innovative.
Waited so long that the MGU-H is on its way out
YES!! FINALLY!
I'd love to see a people's version of this without the front and mid electric motors, only electric spool of the turbo, and a cheaper engine etc
Complicated engineering exercise. Impressive but im a simple man that would’ve seen a V12 instead
Dated at birth
Coming soon to central London, doing 3mph through heavy traffic.
Can't beat roadster though
Would this car face porpoising issue on the track?
I want jeremy clarkson to review this
Forza
Cool but it's an ugly looking car
Tesla Plaid introduces Steering Yoke: Top Gear - Oo Tesla Bad.. How can we counter steer?  AMG One copies Steering Yoke- Top Gear: Ultimate F1 experience people 😒
I want to see this racing a Valkyrie.
Weehickel
I more respect this car more than I like it. its a good technical challenge but its a useless thing its going to be rapid on the track but no one who buys one will do that and its going to be crap on the road because its got an f1 engine and its a massive track car. just a collectors item.
I remember about 20 years back people were saying we would never get a 1000 hp road car. Now we are told 1063 "isn't that much". It's an exciting time for awesome new cars with hybrid power... if you have plenty of ca$h!
I no longer have a car, I have a weheetle 😂
Would love to see the service bill and oil change cost
This should be the f1 safety car!
Well looks like they completely missed their power to weight ratio target. Guess that's why development took so long.
Mhmmm.How mutch MPG?😅😅😅
why couldn't the video be taken from the passenger side. A pathetic way of video-graphing here.
Did y'all really need to copy Koenigsegg?
Wow they included different driving programs and energy management.
When the EVS are 2000hp they are Hyper cars so this is more just a sports car now days
Ugly and outdated. It is like a 918/LaFerrari/P1 that is 10 years late to the party.
it be hella ugly tho
On first look at this car I was blown away cos it reminds me of a Ford GT. I see it as a modified and greater improved Ford GT. I love the interior. It has the class of a Bugatti Chiron, with the precision engineering of Mercedes and Mclauren and the innovation of Tesla. Amazing vehicle.
Against any normal supercar, having an "F1 engine" would be very special. But compared to the crazy Cosworth V12s in the T50 and Valkyrie, I can't help but think a 1.6L V6 will feel a bit dry no matter the performance. No doubt it was incredibly difficult to integrate the powertrain into a road car, and I'm sure it will be very effective, but it isn't the same as an F1 car now they have had to civilise it for the road. I think the 11k+ rpm V12s will beat this for excitement, drama and noise.
Love that it makes the same bong as my 17 plate Vito 😂
I think that CLK-GTR is a way better Race car than this AMG1.  The CLK-GTR was a pure thoroughbred Race with no useless frills added for comfort.  AMG and HWA just took 25 GT-1 race cars and slapped on registration plates purely to comply with GT1 homologation rules.
Finally here!!!!!!   With one car in a showroom and testing footage from the track.
I hope it's not Hamilton's actual F1 engine, else people will keep asking for more power! 🤣
So Mercedes flag ship AMG weapon..is slower then teslas family saloon that won't cost half as much...fail?
I find it ironic how merc shot the initial footage in the abu dhabi track lol Hope this car as a horn has "no mikey that was so not right"
Will look great going around West London at 5mph
A tire on this car is probably cost the same as a 2018 Camaro SS😐
Who thinks forza horizon 5 should of being in Dubai
If it handles as well as it looks it should and can atleast get a top 5 time on the Nürburgring, then it was a success. Because the numbers are underwhelming. a 2.9s hybrid engine with 611hp directly from electric motors.
The first concept was presented in 2017... 5 years ago... no wonder that the design already looks kinda dated (to me)... it looks like a McLaren P1, Porsche 918 era car. Amazing technology of course, but I don't think people are going to buy this for it's looks.
Cool car, boring video.
what would happen if you drop f1 powertrain into a roadcar? 1999 MV Agusta F4? not exactly roadcar but, well, there you go...
Id love one, but i couldnt handle the porpoising.
My only fear of 'putting an F1 engine in a road car', is that F1 engines normally only last a few hundred miles then get rebuilt.  I wonder how much of an F1 engine it really is, or do you need to get it serviced every week?
More boring than an 8h relaxing video. Clarkson can talk about grass with more excitement
Gorgeous. Though, if you took the badges off I’d of said it was a new Lexus hypercar from the front.
Of all the F1 elements, the engine is not the draw card.
I know I might get all the keyboard ninjas lined up and ready, but I'd definitely love to know what Jeremy Clarkson's view is on this car. I'm sorry but being horn in the 90's I still know him as the OG.
It looks like a GT1 car, it will be a great investment, but I really don't like the sticker Logo on the front. It's just looks so cheap, although I know that it must be due to aerodynamics but still...  Designwise I'd still pick one from the holy trinity of hypercars.
1700kg? Slower than a Chiron? I don’t think the Valkyrie or T.50 have anything to worry about here. Total missed opportunity!
Stopped watching after hearing 0-100 in 2.9s
When I have the money I’d still rather buy  a line of all the GTR’s and still have spare cash to cop a villa on the coast of Mexico🙂 but I guess if you can buy one of these money ain’t an issue.
1700 kilos?!
i'd prefer the Valkyrie
@17:05 if you can afford a car like this, chances are your neighbors are far enough away that your car wouldn't wake them up anyways
Not even close to Valkyrie, GM, or even LaF.
this is a 2017 car... and we still waiting for it to hit the streets
Can anyone see the obscenity of a car that costs this much money? It is nice as an engineering exercise, but is a classic example of how the elites in society do not care about the surfs. These same elites are happy for fuel and electricity prices to double and fly around in private jets to the World Economic Forum at Davos.
Ugly, heavy and slow compared to the competition. Expensive af too.
Q: What happens when you put an F1 engine in a road car? A: Deliver an expensive, heavy car, late, that no longer has headline grabbing performance figures vs the competition... and (from a marketing point of view) at a time when the F1 team is no longer winning.  At least it looks pretty.
Couldn’t help noticing you didn’t drive it Jack. Definitely wanting to rub salt into that wound, I’ve been driving One since last November almost every day… in Forza Horizon 5 😂😂
Kinda lost me at 1700kgs, so that’s close to 1800kgs with a driver. Not that this means it isn’t going to be fast, of course it will. But, considering they’ve marketed this as an F1 car for the road despite being a whole tonne heavier. Considering the engine is so small, I do wonder where the extra weight comes from. A tad disappointing.
Yeh  it just ain't top gear without Jeremy Richard and James
...And BRUBUS Will come in and, BOOOM It will be  BRUBUS Mercedes-AMG One 2000HP...
does it move?
Ironic that this car took so long it finally comes out when Mercedes is struggling in F1 lol
N lewis had one already
Man... Top Gear's production quality used to be soo much higher than this. This looks really cheap in comparison what they did 5-6 years ago....
The headlights look exactly like Lamborghini‘s, they are just placed and angled differently and the entire shape of the car (looking from the front) reminds me of a Pagani.
Respect the performance but its ulgy
So this car is basically a 4y old koenigsegg, due to the specs and technology.  Wow, well done Merc.  So in a 2Y there will be Merc TWO 4 seat version of it, basically gemera, but slower ahahaha.  Interesting what it is like, to scream that *I've got an F1 Engine!!!* and be the last at the track
Does it come in any other colours? I’d quite like a blue one.
I love this car so much.. BUT I just feel like it’s a couple years too late 😫
Nice chav trainers.
Many, MANY years ago, following the success of the F40, Ferrari said that it’s successor, the F50 would essentially be an F1 car for the road, with an F1 engine, and the motoring press released many outrageous artists’ impressions of what it was going to look like. Of course when actually released it was nothing of the sort.
How is that only 1.6 liter???  That's crazy
So glad Walter White of this universe is an engineer and not a scientist....
My car has less horsepower than the motor this thing uses just to spin up the turbo...
The running cost will be in the F1 sphere! The engine sound is pretty disappointing!
But no information on the combustion engine
This car is about to get torn apart on the internet🤣
Sad all that effort for nowt really - along comes Barnard and Newey and BANG, MB dead! Previous happened back in the 40's!
Stunning! Finally
It's finished, you can't drive it though
lamborgini
What would Jack Rix do wit his hands if he had no pockets?
So 1063hp 0-60 in 2.9!!! WTF!  Shouldn't something like this be doing something like a 2 sec to 0-60????? Sorry sorry how about 2.3 0-60?
jesus it's as heavy as the all electric evija
So £2.5 million and it only has 2.9 0-60 . I could buy a lot of Tesla plaids for that and do 1.9 0-60
Too heavy, too slow, too late & not innovative enough. Seems irrelevant  compared to it's competitors.
Imagine Brabus getting their hands on one of these
All that money and performance and it will still get smashed by a model S Plaid 😂
Beautiful wee he kil.
Y’all are saying Germans are the only ones who can put a f1 engine in a legal hyper car, that’s wrong, and y’all are saying it’s so hard to put a f1 engine in a car, how is it that hard to? There’s big v12’s that’s like 6.0L for example the Mercedes’ v12 6.0L that’s way way bigger and they manage to fit it in the car. I think what y’all are trynna say is them making a reliable f1 engine.
Looking at the traffic jams in my country, I would love to buy this car with a 100hp motor. absolutely sufficient in traffic jams and max distance when jams are relieved of 50 meters between cars.
It was impressive when we 1st heard about this car, but since then rimac and a few others are more powerful and look better.
Top Gear? Top Gear?! This...This feels like an amateur vlog. Couldn't finish. Poorly blabbed explanation caught on a camera held by a man with sea legs.
Sorry, but this guy interrupting the AMG guy is quite annoying.  Let the guy talk!  Even worse when he's interrupting just to say "oh wow" or not adding to conversation and derailing the guys explanation
The engine might be F1, the whole car isn't. It's a heavy, comfortable Mercedes, as all AMG. I was hoping for 1,200 - 1,300 kg, but company's board decided otherwise.  Switching hope to the LaFerrari successor.
This car is just crazy
This video sucks
Oh come on man let it go shave it off 👨‍🦲
Kinda looks like a Toyota crossed with a porshe
2.4 million for 1700kg and 1063 horses is crap for the price 🤮
The flagship AMG and it's not going to be made at Affalterbach? What?!
3 years to late
Does it do proposing ?🤣
LOLOLOL - AMG got the ME412 project killed, and now they showcase aero solutions from the Superbird,... Looks like they learned plenty from the 'Merger of Equals', just not how to go from design to prototype to production quickly.
I was thinking about what I should get for my first car. Currently between this and the Corsa.
So many engines and that’s all it makes 🤣🤣🤣🤣 that’s slow man
As good as Hamilton this year.
Welcome the new Safety Car!
Parts and servicing could be trick.... 😂
Remember when cars were good looking….!
this top gear guy gives a great interview and asks all the right questions, loved watching it
People being disappointed by this car's performance and forgetting it's German Aston Martin are most likely stating the Valkyries performance while Mercedes are understating this car's performance I have a feeling this will be faster round a track
I want to see this vs a Valkyrie
No middle F1 drivers seat!?
2.700.000$? Maybe i can save up “All sold out” maybe next life
1,7 tonnes??
Its very cheap for what you get, im surprised
Wow finally, it took them like 5 - 7 years? So this is going to trash can, straight from the start. Nothing interesting about it.
I'd take an MC20
The technology, everything under the skin is absolutely amazing!! It's not ugly but it's not attractive either.  Not only is it too heavy, anytime it's not moving, visually it screams "obese"!   They had no choice but give it enough HP to compensate.  Porsche 918 isn't far behind weight wise but at least it's attractive and doesn't look like a boat sitting still!
The sad part is people are not going to drive this wonderful machine 🥲
Anyone remember when Renault dropped one of their F1 engines into an Espace People carrier…or when Ford dropped a Jag Xj220 into one of their Transit Vans…..it appears putting powerful engines into cars /vans isn’t a new idea…who knew 😉😂…that aside great car for sure.
Really puts into perspective the technological marvel that is the chiron
what a masterpiece
It's *Sir Lewis Hamilton
Reminds me of clk gtr!
I honestly have a hard time getting my pulse up about this or other cars in this category, it is so utterly unrelatable.
SAFETY CAR?
Like f1 car
From where do the take the inspiration of designing such a beast car
booooo! No life. boring voice. bring back Mr Clarkson!
strat 2 is for the streets lmao
So almost identical power and weight to a McLaren P1 (a car that came out 9 years ago). I'm disappointed.
Make that as F1 safety car
yet another "first look" at the amg one :)
Cool hope to see the car at Goodwood this year.
I just hope that a few of the owners of these cars actually use them on track and don’t just leave them in an air conditioned showroom.
Totally useless, ugly and obviously very expensive car.  Why so much admiration about it ?
Does it have the party mode🎉 though😂, and the spicy engine🔥😂
Looks like a tuned Mazda mx5
Manny khoshbin happy thoughts
I have to ask a question        Does it say #Blessed?
Ugly fake-3D painted star looks as cheap as those tasteless tigers and mermaids airbrushed on Lexuses
What a shame. No Demo run
Pointless endeavour, Too little too late, in short order i'll beat this and be able to do the shopping in my Tesla roadster.
Can someone fill me up on how they're able to put an F1 engine tech that's still being used in FIA regulation? Wasn't there a rule where u cant use an existing F1 engine that's still being used in F1 and regulated by an FIA? That's why Red Bull used their old V8 on all of their marketings.
Turned this off after 3 minutes. What’s with all the fake laughter when he introduces the bloke from Mercedes? So cringe nearly sick in my mouth.  Oh and the new Tesla is quicker and just over £100k 👍🏻
Already love driving this in Forza. Now can't wait to see it's true performance on IRL tracks.
He should've used "driver" instead of "customer"
I can sell my car just to buy the 4 wheels set of this car ... 😅🤣
Looks pretty average and would’ve been special tech 5 years ago. Amazing tech expertise tho - interesting Wee-hee-kle
It's indescribably ugly.
SF90 is a bargain.
Mercedes made a dolphin car ,i still like it though
The most amusing thing about this is that they developed an App for just 275 drivers 😂
I'd rather have a new W125 Streamliner with supercharged V12 civilized for road use today made of new materials to retake the world record for speed on public roads :-)
Disappointed
Very 😎 Cool 👍👍
the ram air intake is inspired by formula 1 car  me: nah it's inspired by elvis hairstyle
That guy looked like he wanted to kill him for that mistake 😂😂
3:36 why does he laugh at him whilst saying his name😂😂
I'm getting CLK-GTR vibes. I like it. I like it alot.
What is the final price? I'm trying to calculate my monthly payment and insurance and get that all figured out.
Sneaker game crazy 🔥🔥🔥
Out of all crazy halo cars, AMG One is oldest in the making. I remember it was announced back in 2016-2017. Let's hope it's a good one.
I’m sorry but I’m not impressed! 0-60 on just under 3 seconds? And the Chiron is faster to 0-124mph? I was honestly expecting this to weigh around 1000-1200kg …. I would rather have the T-50 and would way rather have the Jesko. This is a let down and unfortunately the game has moved on in the last 6 years since the announcement of this.
This is a desaster project for the image of Mercedes.  I was in 2017 in Frankfurt at the presentation of this car,because Michael Jordan ordered one on paper and wanted to know what i think about it.  I gave my analise and told that the car is a complication of himself and I think that it will have a lot of issues.  Jordan was a big Mercedes fan and his garage was full of all pearl of Mercedes,so he told that he he keep the order, because he absolutely want it. They promissed to deliver his car 2018 and this was already a delay time from the contract....than there was one dalay after the other till Jordan cancelled this order and sold all Mercedes he had. This kind cars are "emotional toys" and the buyers are even more emotinal,but Mercedes has killed all emotins after 5 years of delay.  Imagine that the clients purchased this toy on 100% trust in Mercedes, because all was sold before the Frankfurt presentation and there was already people selling "virtually" the car for 1 million more.  This is really a dark project of Mercedes even if the car would perform, but i have serious doubts that this car would perform much better than all the cars existing in his category.  PS.I could see one year ago a AM Valkyre in final spec driving next to me in München and I was blowen away from earth the AMG One I saw only at the Nürburgring some months ago and as camouflaged version.  In the end, this kind of "dream toys " nobody will really use or test properly so it doesen t really matter how finalized they are in the end. Mercedes lost the trust, because they was not sure if it would be the best hyper car after the delays.They  had not to lie and give the fault on emission issues, otherwise they tell us that Mercedes has uncompetent engeneers.  It was just a internal political issue of companies that have only managers  but no real Owner.
0-60 in 2.9s? was expecting much lower tbh.
Strat 2 Mode: Aka; " Ok Lewis Close the gap as much as u can Its Hammertime!"
It is really beautiful and aggressive looking this car 👏🏼 🔥
Well, so typical of the Germans and Mercedes - so complicated that most owners will struggle to cope with the myriad of options; and, I ask myself, will they be able to drive the car in race mode, just because they have the ability to pay for it. It is an interesting car, for sure, but not as good looking as Gordon Murray’s two cars and the Aston Martin, even if they are all built in the UK. Oh, and the V12s sound a million times better!           Martin Hann.
As amazing as it is, does anyone else think its kinda ugly? Not a good ugly like some grotesque overly styled Pagani, just plain old ugly.
Make this the new F1 Safety Car
2.5 Million $ Hypercar has the same turn signals stocks as a Mercedes A Class 😂 cost cutting Querks and Features from Doug 😂
It’s a shame it’s so ugly and looks nothing like a merc. Even the badge on the front doesn’t look like it’s supposed to be there… quick edit… is that a STICKER?
It’s these hypercar developments that could-should be-used to advance hybrid tech in every day cars instead of force feeding us EV’s
Idk, I don't seem to like the tone of the journalist here. Feels like he's forcing the lead engineer to say this and that rather than having a nice discussion and fluid transitions to the next subject
Marco: "It is a really funny thing here, ...." proceeds to tell how they carried out investigations in a wind tunnel about how air gets stuck in the front wheel arches and how that leads to less down force. Man, I love germans.
I'm on 10 quid an hour I might treat myself to a couple of these👍
I would've bought one, but there's no way I will spend a penny funding those turds Lulu Crymilton and Toto Wolff.  Besides, all they did is take the McLaren F1, and give it a modern look.
The thing looks like garbage, also the powertrain is in my opinion just a gimmick. Compared to the Valkyrie this thing appears to be a shoe box. We a have a formula one engine in a road car 🤦‍♂️ what a compromise
1700kg?!? It won't lap faster than the Valkyrie, do the 1/4 mile quicker than an Evija, or be more fun than a T.50... so what's it for?
This is an very complicated machinery. Valkyrie seems a better though vehicle with a focused goal. Why not have just two motors like the F1, ~5 kwh battery pack, and under 1300 kg weight?! Are they trying to say, "It's environmentally friendly." Which I don't think so, cause a sports car never is.
We want the AMG one and the Aston Martin Valkyrie to be f1's safety cars, not the slow turtles we have now.
Greatest car this year, worst presentation of this year 😬
I am gonna order this one,  I will be driving this car when going shopping for yacht
And the engine will blow off after 10 or 15000 km.1700 kg, what an improvement AMG!🤣🤣🤣
Benefactor Krieger
Guys what’s next??? I mean an F1 engine in a production car! All my days!
Heah write finally finished like all of us paid the depozit and waiting for the car, get out of here its only finally for you cause you can now review the car and the rich sheikh’s can add it to their collection in a garage in a desert.
So Bugatti is there thinking nice try 😂
Monster 🔝🔝🔝
I still fear its become a little dated.. I like the DRS button. wonder how many will be damaged in the first year.
It’s another world apart from the amg gt r. Only, open F1 wheels Plus the suspension on F1 that handles the lateral g forces…. More like a Cam car.  But out of this world beauty.  Thanks to AMG builders. The public will benefit in the future from the hard work and talent of the AMG engineers.
Wonder if they engineered in the porpoising so I can be exactly like Lewis!
Didn't Mercedes claim in a 2017 TG magazine the project one would do 0 to 125 quicker than the chiron ?
Not to convinced about the weight of the car…
Green hell official lap time. That's all we want to know.
The people who have bought these cars will never drive them as Intented for driving on the track, burning rubber and setting blistering laps. Due to the price they are viewed by the purchasers mostly as speculative investments that after 10-15 years will increase in value and will spend most of their time in private collections with less than 1k on the odometer.. quite sad really 😞
wow
Odd thing to say but it looks like it should be so much lighter. It’s a proper fatty at 1700kg and that will affect everything. This thing should be lighter
Sorry but I must be missing something? I have the upmost respect for Merc just for doing this but what does the f1 power train really bring to the party?  That sounds a ridiculous thing to ask but if the whole raison d’etre for this car was just doing that then I fail to see the point when the mesmerising v12’s developed for Murray and RBR offer similar power in a much lighter package. Mpg?
Clarkson or Matt Watson pls, how is this video so boring?
It was an honor to be involved in this project!! (Testbed installation in Brixworth)
Perfect example for how to ruin 20 min video by just talking rather than driving when you get AMG One for just a day
i would love to see one as f1 safety car
Ohne Jeremy Clarkson ist top gear Scheiße
Didn't know Eoin morgan designed Cars, always thought he's a sports person
GMA T50 s surely will outclass this merc basing on weight difference alone. Whopping 900 kilo difference man. Come on! ! !
It’s so ugly and boring looking
I thought I'd see the AMR first
"we're going to have a real nerd out"...proceeds to tell us nothing about the engine.
What an amazing wii-hickle
I've been using this car to win races in GTA online for years now ;-)
No way does this do 0-60 in 2.9sec. The new Mercedes Amg Gt63 E performance which weighs 2.4 tons with 840hp does 2.8sec 0-60. So there's no way this car which is lighter and got more power does 2.9sec. I say 2.5 I think Amg is trynna be conservative about is acceleration. We gonna see some crazy numbers for sure
Built in Coventry and not by Mercedes
Amazingly detailed, the big question for me now is should I go for this or the 1990 Honda civic DX at a local scrapyard
this is Bugatti chiron. same lines. back. LED.
1700kg isn't exactly lightweight 😅
out of all the years, they chose this year😂😂😂
They made a real life kreiger
Imagine if Hammond takes it on a test drive 🤔
Did anyone else guess the german accent  from the guy just by the look of his face? xD
How is the porpoising?
I was immediately disappointed when I heard the weight figures...1,600k!!! Are you kidding me?! Have they taken time to look over at the valkyrie figures.
Good think it’s fast, that way people don’t have to look at it long
Cool car 2-3 years ago. Now it's a little bit ... meh.. Troppo lento Mercedes, troppo lento
If you are a multi millionaire there are onlly two hypercars to buy. The Gordon Murray designed GMA T.50 and the astonishing GMA T.50s Niki Lauda.
How do you make a F1 engine that lasts more than 10.000 km ?
the german being a german
Awesome to hear they are being built in the UK
It’s obviously insanely cool that this car has the most dominant power unit in F1 but compared the the T50 and the Valkyrie I think it’s a day late and a dollar short…minus the dollar part of course. The aero doesn’t excite me like it does on the others. Can’t wait to see side by side lap times in 2027 or whenever all three of these cars are actually out.
while making comparisons, just remember this is a 1.6l motor
Quite possibly the most rubbish thing/personnel to ever be called “Top Gear”. That includes the metro sexual bespectacled bearded plaid wearing American that belongs on QVC, selling mops & vacuums.  Top Gear: How do we make the new AMG One w/ 1,063 hp uninspiring? Top Gear: Watch this.
I hope they take this thing around the Nurburgring. It would be very interesting to see how it fares with all that hub chub. I mean, I'm all for a little curve in the rear and a nice set of back dimples, but damn... 4,000+ lbs wet is a big girl.
1695kg isn't too bad, but can't help but wonder how it would go without the electric motors 400kg lighter
Why does it look like a McLaren
Its a cool car love the style of it but its crazy to me that the Porsche 918 came out nearly a decade ago and is quicker to 62 miles, the same speed to 124 miles and similar top speeds. I'd rather of the 918 even though I prefer the aggressive styling of the AMG One, I think I'd have more fun with a N/A 4.6L V8 Hybrid.
1700 kg? I mean... whats the point?
Ugly.
But will it be the best car.... "IN THE WORLD" ?
Grille front looks like Great Dane on rear sear with it's head outside in the wind at high speed...🤣🤣🤣
The amg looks like an Lamborghini on the front and an audi in the back
Oh look, another Hypercar. Nothing to see here, move along
Sorry, but that has to be the ugliest hyper-F1 car ... the Lotus Evija looks 100X better and is twice as fast.  No wonder Mercedes F1 is doing so poorly in 2022 ... this has to be the worst design I've seen yet.
Finally I get to see this m'fka in motion.
Disappointing weight I think for that level of car.
The worsed sounding F1 generation and NOW they made a road car based on it....
They should have kept the weight under 1500 kgs.
You lost me at ” all units sold out”, so really uninteresting to see the rest since it can not be bought anyway…..
Three years too late to the market?
can you skip the cars and get us the olders people you had before in the show?
Nothing special
This review is terrible. Top gear is completely dead now
Excellent job Mercedes!!!🤘🤘🤘
This vehicle reminds me of the P1in many ways!!
The appeal of an "F1 engine in a road car" is the noise... This doesn't have that at all. I'd have a Lexus LFA over this anyday... Or a Renault Espace F1 of course.
The Holy Trinity Part 2: AMG ONE, Aston Martin Valkyrie, Murray T50. Praying for a remaking of the first Grand Tour episode with these. Who do you think would drive which?  I think Clarkson would take the AMG ONE, Hammond takes the Valkyrie, and May takes the T50
Dumb car 0_62 in 2.9 !! Weight 1695 kg!!
Finallly！We are all waiting for you！
This car has been coming out for so long, I forgot about it.
How far has top gear fallen when you're presenting a highly exclusive car and reading everything off a phone 😂 surely they could get teleprompter
1,700 kg ??? Yea the Valkyrie definitely takes the trophy
It's absurd most people are literally  all praise and excitement for this car. While the HONDA NSX on launch received so much hate from car enthusiasts and non-enthusiasts alike for being too technologically advanced. Wow just wow. Poor NSX didn't received much recognition it deserve.
Couldn't wait to race this with Williams F1 to see which is better for grocery.
Every time he says vehicle I literally wanna burn my ears
5:17 we heatle?
With what they used to claim the final figures are underwhelming. Almost 1700kg seems wayy to heavy for this thing to be able to compete with other new-gen hypercars. The Valkyrie should dominate this car judging from stats alone.
All this years in development and all this hype around the powertrain and all we get is a cow of a car that couldn't even move with just that puny engine and it's outshined by every competitor. If you really want an F1 for the road think Vallkyre or T 50 S . As a billionare who ordered this I would be very dissapointed now.
Wow merc's corvette😙😙
1700kg. *laughs in Gordon Murray*
Wowwwww what a nice insane beautiful 😍 new AMG 1 Mercedes-Benz Super car INCREDIBLE Steering Wheel like Formula 1 race Car Thanks for this wonderful video godbless from the Philippines 🇵🇭 sir Vhin 😍❤️🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😎👏👏👍👍
What an amazing we-hickle
Is this car on PlayStation Grand Turismo 7 yet? It is all I can afford to drive.
So sick of the term, "hypercar".  Just call a supercar, a supercar, ok?  Numerous supercars travel from 0-60 mph in 2.9 seconds & travel over 200 mph.  "Hypercar" is a gimmick term with one of the intentions being to extract an extra $500,000 from ego-driven customers.  That all being said, the AMG-One is an incredible car!
This is who Top Gear sent?
lets gooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
soo... when will we get these cars as safety cars??
Looks like toyota to me
Make a station wagon version for Doug Demuro.  "THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS! is my new station wagon, and today I am going to show you all of its quirks and features before my wife finds out there is no money left in our bank accounts"
if i saw this car drives 20 mph in central london  ''ONLY'' .. i will lose hope in humanity .
This took too long I have no interest in it anymore. So much delays and lies
Tesla Plaid will smoke this no problem
Needs a hyperscreen.
Bmw could never. They just released a CSL car that’s slower than the 2 year old amg gtr and more expensive.
The true successor to the McLaren F1!!
One would never day there is massive poverty and starvation in the world when you look at what some people buy. No one needs this, go help some starving people.
That frot is very reminiscing of a Huracan, specially the headlights.
Will it fit mud terrain tires or no?
It sounded great
The amount of love "sis wehikel" must have received during its inception is really palpable.
Looks like a baby shark do do do…
3:55 🤣
Still not a fan of top gear anymore...its never going to be the same..guy doesn't even know how to present properly cos he has his phone in his hand
While Tesla hasn't managed to make an electric vehicle (the Tesla roadster) mercedes managed to put an actual F1 engine in a road car. well done mercedes! 🥳
Wow this shit don't make sense... How does a car that weighs almost 2000 pounds less and apparently similar horsepower lose to my Model S Plaid by almost a full second 0-60 and beat it to a quarter mile? Love this car but very surprising
"There is no such thing as F1 Engine for the public road..." Clarkson...
0-124 in 7? It was meant to be <6, what happened?!
I do hope they've resolved the porpoising issue :-/
I can't wait to see someone in an AMG One on the highway and uses the DRS to pass a slow Ferrari
Wenn a german speaks english, but grow up in the hills- regards from a German. HAHA. Great video!
Headlights already look dated.
Hope it’s value sky rocketed  cause honestly  Don’t understand it’s purpose. I prefer rimac not this one. All of these battery and complicated engine and etc 0-60 2.9?!really?!2.2 million dollars??
It's so funny to see how the Project Lead looks like he's semi-clueless about the car.  Jack: *"So, what's the reason behind the painted Merc logo?"* PL: *"..."* Jack: *"It must've been for aerodynamics, and weight-savings, right?"* PL: *"Yes. Absolutely."*  Perhaps it's due to language barrier, but it's funny nonetheless 😂
The weehickle is outstanding
I thought this was forza horizon 5
it's slower than bugatti. case closed
Fat car
stoped watching at 4:40....gues why🤦‍♂️😂🤐
Intro recorded in Miami's new track i believe, dope
Might be the best whehical ever made
This car is a mistake from mercedes side...
And mercedes finally made a hypercar and now Mercedes has every car in every category,  bmw:still making normal cars😂😂
I actually don’t like the shape of it from the side :/ not that I had an order placed or anything lol
At first, wait what ! Isn't the design of Porsche 911 turbo 🤔
F1 engine (V6 turbo hybrid), yea whatever. Best for billionaires who just buys hypercars for investment.
So it’s heavier than a Lotus Evija, has half the power for the same price, and will need an engine rebuild after 60k miles. The end of the ICE age is nigh…
I don’t want to know anything until CHRIS HARRIS drives it .
Can’t wait to see these porpoising down the highway
The porpoising in this car must be really bad….
I’m still trying to get a W204 C63 AMG 😂
Im sorry but the front is really ugly…
Now  I'm waiting for Nico to get his
Absolutely love that Valterri is getting a special one
If it were 20 years ago with 20 years-ago-tech - that would be awesome. Modern age F1 is as boring as is this vehicle
Does it have F1 clutch launch?
They're too late, that specs are not soo impressive anymore.
Uninspired and already old in terms of esthetics. Compared to an Aston Valkyrie it disappears instantly. Don't like it.
2.9 is embarrassing
That's heavy for a car with a formula one engine
It's the Krieger from Gta online
So, since one of the motors only spins the turbo its a theoretical 900hp  And 1700kg? What a barge. Id have a gordon murray if i had hypercar money
2.9s to 60? Hmmmm
I think the people who owns this car dont care about their neighbors very much😂
Surprised they went with 1063 hp and not 1044 hp 😉
So much technology and R&D and only 2.9s to 100km/hr…..
The electric motor on the turbo is actually a REALLY good idea. Idk why no one has thought of that. It makes total sense
It’s got DRS, pit limiter, Strat 2… the only thing missing is a radio button to tell Bono that my tyres are gone.
This guy reads the specs on his 🤳. Come on.
Wait it doesn't have true DRS?
No Mercedes car can beat ours.
Blatantly owns the F1 fantasy toy trophy! A no-excuses adult plaything. And, gee, they're already sold out.
Bono, my tyres are gone.
How about a Mercedes-AMG One Cup on iRacing? ;)
Tesla still faster 🤔
With F1 engine? I thought that is more likely a vacuum cleaner engine... Disgusting sound...
Jack Rix saying vehicle: *vehicle* Marko Lochmar: *weehittal*
I could never afford it, but if I could I’d be sending my money to Gordon for a T50. I’ll take a real driver’s car over inspector gadget.
Its time to upgrade the F1 safety car! The car can now race along with others
So this still can’t beat Tesla model S plaid in 0-60 lol 😂 man $2.4millie wow really beautiful though I bet is a beast on track till the new roadster comes out which is quarter of the price
Nice car. But those shoes, Jack?
Looks like an MC20
Unbelievable how many people there are in the comment section doubting this car ..............  You are getting a *Street Legal* car with a *F1* powertrain that looks like it came from CyberPunk. *Please read that again*.  Mercedes could make a V16 car with infinite fuel and no emissions and pretend engineers on the internet will still hate. *SMH*
Still can't decide whether I should buy this or the F/A-18 Hornet.
Pretty informative but it doesn't have that Clarkson oomph
So stunning!  Toyota/Lexus fan boys though will continue to bash this German as ‘unreliable’ 😏
bugatti: you have no power here kid
This is like the amg gtr pro wasent enough
underwhelming
What an absolute monument to pointlessness. All that work, all that thought, all that engineering to produce something so spectacularly irrelevant.
Boy, is that thing ugly!
Obviously a mega car, anyone would have one if they could. I'd be interested to hear about the decision to drive the front wheels with electric motors rather than allow it to be RWD hybrid only, it adds weight and takes away the traditional race car dynamics associated with the engine pedigree. Effectively, it's a slightly heavier SF90 with a fancier engine and bonus motor to spin up the turbo and better aero.
In 1994, the McLaren F1 ran to 60mph in 3.1s and topped out at 231mph limited and 243mph delimited. The new Turbo S will hit 60mph in 2.6s top out at 205mph for 1/10th the price of this car.   Where is the innovation or hypercar wow factor here? All I see is lots of tech for tech’s sake. Would love to have seen  900hp+  1000kg RWD with F1 engine and 1 motor between gearbox and engine with focus on amazing weight savings, handling, and suspension dynamics.
A a German I had to listen twice at 2:31 🌝😂
Wet weight 1700kg ,still toooo heavy
do you think it will beat the 919 Evo world record on the Nordschleife
Thinking of trading my house in to put finance this car 🤔. (Decisions decisions…..)
What is the song at the beginning? It’s driving me crazy I can’t remember it
Valkyrie and T.50 will walk all over this bloated pig.
We’ve had it in Forza Horizon 5 😉
don't tell me they have a sticker as their emblem for the front of the car 🤣
So flat out around a track how long before the battery depletes itself.
hmmm....same steering stalks as my Tesla Model S and Mercedes C series
I really hate people, when they really don't appreciate the amount of work and r&d has gone into developing these cars...
At 3:11 you can see it doesn't lower in sync (left/right). Hope there's a speed limit for lowering the car.
This car vs Aston Martin Valkyrie
No room for the kids. I'm out.
finished before stradmans gallardo ;)
Cameras and lights will use more energy than this after purchasing.
I already bought this car, Top 2 fastest car all around in the roads of Los Santos.
Has it not crossed the designers that with the delays in finalizing, the design is now kind of dated for 2022? Look at the front.. looks like a face lift of Supra .. again this is subjective individual opinion. But honestly neither numbers, nor the design is really a stand out when it comes to its contenders... or has it been a design deicison to imply a hybrid supercar DNA? either ways, not impressive imagining the price tag it's going to bear
They have that one done, when do they start delivering customer cars, 2025 ?
Wasn't that question answered by the Ferrari F50?
Weehickle = Vehicle.
Amazing engineering... But it's a bit heavy, no?
Is he reading off his phone?
Why did they hire Sebastian Vettel to do the commentary? 😂
So that's barely an F1 engine. It weighs what 3500 lbs ?  Slow clap.
Hmmm... Looks like Porsche 918 spyder (front) & Bugatti Chiron (back)...
It looks like a Bugatti and a Porche 918 had a baby but a VERY UGLY BABY LMAO!!!!!! LOL
Proper vid
Automated manual? Why? Just for the weight? Disapointed.
That interior looks cheap and it will age very quickly. What a huge let down this is
Beautiful masterpiece of engineering. Unfortunately, most owners won’t even drive them.
Beautiful masterpiece of engineering. Unfortunately, most owners won’t even drive them.
The front of the car is horrendous!!!!!!! HOLY ****!!!!! Absolutely ugly
Is it weird that my favourite part of this video is that green jacket? It's 🔥🔥🔥
That's one of the ugliest supercars ever 🤢🤮
Can’t wait to see a few of these around.  It’ll be great seeing all the technology
As much as technology progresses, a low weight will always be fundamental for any performance car. 1695kg is pretty darn heavy
It’s not very good looking, it’s too heavy, slower than a Chiron in a straight line and it has a stupid steering wheel.
Nobody needs this this times
Well this is already a star ⭐️
Whatever. For that price I’ll just buy an Aventador SVJ Roadster, and it sounds better and louder & I’ll have 1.5million dollars leftover.
No point in this car. Bunch of gimmicks
1.7 tonnes! Too much weight.
Rimac? nope. F1 engine? Ferrari FFX, Ford Hyper van. I'm sure its nothing new. Look good tough.
'utterly useless'
Sucks that even people who make a high earning salary can’t even afford this…. I hate seeing cars like this because they’re really only made for billionaires
Safe to assume the aston martin valkirye is faster?
So it’s slower than a Chiron in a straight line tut
I'll take 10 Model S Plaids at 1,000 Horespower each and 4 Doors. Vs just one of these.
Just not sure about the shark fin design…
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ bored
I want to get incredulously high in this.
1700kg. What in the world. It's no faster 0-124mph than a 765LT even though it's AWD with at least 200 more bhp. How? As a package, it's not even exciting considering it has an F1 engine. Out of this and the Valkyrie, the Valkyrie dominates and it's not even close like everyone thought it might have been. So much potential too.
Seems to be a car extreme in 2017?
Krieger
I just wanna see it race the Valkyrie
Massive massive respect to Mercedes for attempting and being successful for putting an F1 engine in a car and making it available to (some) people.  They should do a public tour for all F1 fans around the world, its a public service for us.
"I don't have the exact number" on the downforce change for the DRS. Shortly after he was fired for his incompetence to Mercedes standards.
Nothing special to today standards
GR63/AMG One vs Lando/McLaren P1 vs Vettel/Valkyrie vs LeClerc/LaFerrari vs Verstappen/918 @ Silverstone..🤔
And most of them will end up in collections and sold in years to come with less than 1000kms on the clock...great engineering, but no real world place to use them...except cruising in Monaco in 1st gear...
It… it doesn’t look real. I don’t know how else to say it, but it doesn’t seem like a car this insane should exist, and it truly looks like a 3D model
1600cc engine !!!!!!???? 1600 kgs, looks dumb and ricey on the road, needs a rebuild every 30000 km or something, costs millions of dollars.  Trust the germans to get this wrong on every level.  All that engineering expertise but they can never get the initial design brief right hence why Mercedes has not made a single worthy sports/super/hyper car since the gullwing.  KISS principle guys stick the v12 you sell to pagani in a less fussy version of this.
- F1 engine - Specially developed tires  Imagine how much maintenance must cost
They forgot to add the ‘Burnout’ button  to the steering wheel for those moments when you need to warm your tires up at the stop light haha
The Hamilton-ish car for the road🏎️🏎️🏎️
Looks stupid.
I'll take a Venom F5
Great decision to build it in the UK with the quality and manufacturing standards that the British are known for, as we all know that Germans can not build a proper car.
Here for the car, not TOPGear
Am i the only one who's underwhelmed by this car?
0-60 2.9 seconds? Ah hahaha, how is that good?
i thought the Ferrari f50 was the first production street legal car with an f1 engine in it. and i suppose the next will be Britain's own- the Aston Martin valkyrie
Slower than a 2 tonne chiron? Lol
oh yeah, this thing. 🥱
I wanted him to answer why they didn't make it center drive.
3:48-4:03 The moment when you realized that you haven't done your homework 😂
Ferrari F50 beat them to it.
It already looks dated
I dont like the front badge!  My build sheet if I could would be to do it in a vinyl sticker so I could remove it when it comes home.  Should save the 16 steps and about what?  $100,000??  Although I bet in a vinyl sticker would cost about $50,000 because “we don’t do that so it custom and this is what it’ll cost.”
Probably the greatest car ever to be made.  Shame just for movie stars and Arabs.
Would live to hear it
A lovely weeheecle
I’m amazed they got the cooling down with this thing. F1 cars are built around living on the track, able to regularly break 140mph every few minutes (ie a lap) and can feed those radiators a ton of air. To make one of those engines stand being driven around on the road and possibly in traffic is very impressive. That and the engine tuning must have gotten super weird, 1250rpm idle is insane, plus that thing isn’t going to be seeing ram air effects regularly throughout its life.
I still love company’s talking about taking a 1.5-2million+ dollar car to the track it will literally never even see the end of the driveway
bold and wise move from Mercedes and AMG. bravo
Run-of-the-mill, $120K, Tesla Plaid S, 0-60, 2.0 sec. And it carries a ton of luggage and people.  On the street, the AMG One would never know what happened. Will the AMG One go faster? Surely. So what? You have somewhere to drive where you can reach 200+mph? Does it handle better? Sure, where you going to drive like that? Spend time on the insurance pool and that cools you down quickly. And...this car is just ugly. The T.33 is boring. Lamborghinis are uncomfortable. SUV's everywhere. McClarens are dull-looking. Ferraris are pretty but...hot hatches are just as capable now. It's all over. All of the fun that we used to have with our cheap European sports cars with 90bhp is over. Can't even work on the bastards anymore...
They really de-tuned the engine significantly (for reliability of course) and that's why the extra 2 163hp electric motor in front.
Look amazing but so boring
13:37 that face says it all! Amazing. A joy to watch and learn about.
Too boring. Cant watch this child presenter. TG used to be interesting..
Mercedes should call Hennessey Performance to make it faster.
Ta , Can Go , Hard 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
IMO, "with an F1 engine" doesn't mean as much ever since they started sounding like John Deere tractors.
Its not a nice looking hyper car.
Can't wait to take my order,  been waiting forever.
Looks like a Porsche Spyder, Jesko Absolut and such. Next up I'll see Porsche doing a car that looks like Mercedes. Lol
More beautiful than I anticipated. A technological Marvel. But at 3700 pounds 1700 kg , You have to wonder the whole point of an F1 engine is to save weight...  In the end it is half an electric car Which is not a bad thing, But kind of takes away from the idea of an F1 street car
Overly Complicated Drivetrain & Instantly Obsolete…
Finally. Time for a race against Valkyrie & T50.
Beautiful but waaaay too heavy
This car is techno porn.
all it needs is an F1 V10
Is this amazing car going to break the automotive history ever  Real F1 engine for road car what a achievement
I think I’ll just buy another Miata.  They are, after all, always the answer.
Gumpert front CLK-GTR rear ?
I think I'll stick with my 2006 Toyota Corolla. I just don't see the value for money here. Sorry Mercedes!
Supra vibe
I'll take a Valkyrie thanks.
At least it still has a gas engine
1700kg?? Thats a disappointment
Waiting for the rest of the Forza Horizon 5 fans to arrive, we have this car already.
What's song in the beginning?
anyone find it kinda funny how it has Michelin tires instead of pirellis
All of these videos of the car in motion aren't even real.  Is 2:22 supposed to be convincing??
Can't wait to pick up this "Ve hicle" in the used car lot
Those crispy air max 1s tho👀
Benefactor Krieger ?
Called Hertz to see if they had this in stock for the day.
Bro idgaf about what’s in the car I just wanna see a review on a track
doug is gonna have a field day with these quirks and features
I'm honestly confused by this "project" A Valkyrie will embarrass this. A Chiron, 918, Laferrari, F12,812,GT2RS will all out perform this and they are all 6-10 years old..
Looks like a pagani
Valkyrie is still Better in my eyes. I respect this. But there's something else about a screaming v12
Did he say 2.9 sec 0-60?? isn't this is very much what the BMW M8 Competition does for about 5% of the cost? Hmmm
Is this Rosberg’s? 👀
Get Chris Harris on it
Damn i hate that intro. Just the car and the engine note is enough.
The noise this car makes is horrible, too bad manufacturers have to cope with regulations. Otherwise the car is perfect, engineering masterpiece.
Too late to the party, I already bought a Hyundai instead, if it had been on sale in 2017 I would’ve bought it.
Anybody else think merc might be using this to avoid the F1 budget cap on development?
Convergent Evolution works in Hypercars as well, I guess...  They are starting to all look the same.
Tesla suv still faster 0-60
The Ford transit 350 high roof had similar results in the wind tunnel 😳 😬 😄
So do you have to work pump heated coolant and heated oil through the engine before you can start it
Its kinda slow now
I wanna see Clarkson doing a top gear test of this car for us
Bmw is finish 🤣🤦🏾‍♂️
Aaand... it will be sold to Saudi Billionaires who never drive it.
is it me or is this thing pretty ugly
He starts with the engine but doesn’t even say what engine it has, just says the electric motors and total power output. lol
3:05 my grandma was sitting with me and she was like "today's gen is always on those stupid phones even when he is a reviewing" 😂
That's quite a wuh-HEEKL
Does it do a lap dance,and cook your meals for you? 🤣🤣🤣
But lowkey tho who is this bozo they chose for this, he doesn’t know anything about cars
This the New CLK AMG GTR. Pretty Fire 🔥
So Mercedes AMG HPP produces 1063 BHP. Christian would be delighted to know that😂
It looks like a catfish
They’ve already done the f1 power train with the bmw m5 e60
It doesn't sound like F1... Why would anyone buy it over Gordon Murray T1 or Aston Martin?
“You did it, you crazy son of a b*tch you did it.”                                     -Jeff Goldblum,1993
Valkyrie makes this look old.
what you get when Bugatti, Lamborghini, Ferrari, and Hennessey have an unholy foursome.
"Tested all over the world, from Abu Dhabi to Dubai" rofl
Not the prettiest car I've ever seen but I bet it's badass
Still prefer the Tesla roadster over this.  Just because of red light GP!!!  And is still much much faster.    Roadster star man is still the fastest car in our solar system.  75,000 mph currently.    Wake me up when any other brand comes close.  ;)
The krieger is finally here
Mercedes F1 team: how to salvage blown F1 engines? Mercedes road car team: Lets make a million+ dollar hypercar.
Hi guys it's shmeeeeeeeeeee look what I've just bought
Other than the engine there's nothing unique or better than competition
About time Mercedes stepped in
Would have been awesome three years ago.
Waiting on BMW to build one too
It’s a pity it looks so ugly.
Please god, I don't ask for much. But let me one day own this🙏🙏
Hope it doesn't have porpoising...
A disappointment. It came out too late, hype is gone. Specs are just so disappointing, the last thing it has to it is the sound.
A disappointment. It came out too late, hype is gone. Specs are just so disappointing, the last thing it has to it is the sound.
I never understood hyper cars. The speed limits are still 60kph to 100kph for most roads. Track days? Yes plz
A beast, ugly as sin though,
I wonder if mercedes will put nico's world title winning engine in his car
first time seeing it, i remember gemera..
I have this car on FH5
I do remember AMG claiming this will do 124mph under 6 seconds a few years back...
This is just an impressive work of engineering.
But is it cooler than a fiat multipla
This car has reset the benchmark in my opinion.
It’s not JUST about power, it’s about the experience. It doesn’t have to be the fastest, just speed doesn’t matter anymore, you can get 0-60 in 2 seconds with a Tesla, but that doesn’t mean it’s the best car in the world. Nowadays you have to give something more, something different, That’s why this car took so long, it is absolutely perfect.
seriously doubt he meant to say one electric motor of 122 hp just to drive the turbos.  surprised he didn't speak of the engine,, ie. rpm, torque etc..??
Why was Koenigsegg never mentioned  once…? :(
Can someone explain what the hell he's saying "Waheetel" or something like that?
"We somehow strapped a catalytic converter to an F1 car and made it push 1000hp" The Germans are madlads
In this category of cars, the Aston Valkyrie is still my favorite. A marvel of engineering and design IMO and of course 1:1 power to weight ratio and an absurd amount of downforce.
Superb work Mercedes AMG
Who is this shmoe? Top gear just isn't top gear without jezza hamster and Captain slow
This is Very impressive but only 275 individual’s of the of this World  Will get to ever really experience and enjoy such an awesome car, they need to make something like this possible for none billionaires and millionaire. I’m very well-off but can never afford anything more than a car that’s $150,000 Which is what I have now
there will always be some sadness when u see a top gear notification and you immediately think of is clarkson hammond and may
Nice car. Extremely impractical and very expensive. Fact is the money dudes will just have the as a place to hide money. And in the end the car will never be used and sold between other rich dudes who will never use it either.   Kinda like bit coin that's pretty to look at. Shame but that's the way it is
This is bugatti.lol
Does it come with a drivetrain warranty?
veeheekla
No offence mate,  but could you not get Jeremy Clarkson to commentate on this stunning machine?
Imagine this as the safety car in f1 😮
2013 LaFerrari, P1, 918 Spyder vs. 2023 AMG One, Valkyrie, T.50
Yes, The SF90 is probably quicker and lot cheaper but the AMG One is going down in history as one the greatest cars ever made 👏  Car manufacturers don't take risks like this anymore and this car with the F1 engine is an incredible achievement for Mercedes.
Weeheecle 🤣🤣
I'm not a fan of this tg host...
Would've liked to see Jeremy James and Richard there, not this sucker.
Daaaammmmnnnn🤯🧐
Where can I buy one of these ?
Well than as a Mercedes tech look forward to seeing someone buy this
But what about the reliability?  As we all know F1 cars go through several engines through one year. No one will be pushing this car as hard as an F1 but If they do. What will be the situation.
Hybrids are so damn stupid, make it all electric or gas, stop with overly complicated crap!!!
PETRONAS AMG-1👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
"recharge on" - me to myself, while coasting or braking... in my dreams
Nice! Good to see the 21st century's take on the mk1 Escort's "dog bone" grille!
The T.50 laughs in lightweight. 1700kg, lolllllll
How many power units to I have to buy to get through one year? How many hours is a power unit good for? Is it sealed with gaskets now instead of perfectly machined billet surfaces? Yes, how much f1 engine is there? It is totally an amazing, fantastic and exciting to see this as complete. Yet, I must know how absurd it is to use as a "car"!
Ferrari and red bull are still faster
Just one descriptive word needed  Phenomenal...,...
So pretty much an sf 90.
How on earth are they making a track weapon with an F1 engine and then lean so heavily into the completely useless „everyday luxury“ side that it becomes 1700kg? I mean… this is their hypercar and yet it‘s heavier than their GT? Someone missed the memo on what „f1 engined“ is supposed to come out to, apparently.
jack looks depressed he should get some help if he needs it , feel better buddy
Manny Khoshbin has entered the chat
Either use metric or imperial. Or when you are explaining, explain it on both unit of measurement. Its kind of confusing when he explain it the speed in miles and next the weight uses kg. :/
I'll wait for Chris Harris to drive it
Wonder what the service intervals are
Looks like it's still stuck in 2017.  Looks subdued compared to the Valkyrie.
It's going to be so unreliable
Press a button and it turns into a P1.
I can't wait to never see one of these. They will be bought up by rich people and never see the road. What's the point?
Weeeehicle
Nah,  it's 3 years late.  Others have moved on to 2000bhp range...
Up next.....the stig takes a lap!
undecided between this or twin turbo r8 now
Iv had this car in Forza for a longgggg time now. Boring.. next.
It’s gonna need an exhaust right away!
Couldn't wait for mine, cancelled order, bought a 370Z 😁
I am just lost for words. I JUST LOOOOOVE IT !!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Champagne is flowing at GMA.
I don’t want to fix this car when it breaks…they all break…but it is awesome! I have a 2008 Honda…I can fix that when it breaks😁
This is the most German guy I've ever seen
The design already looks old since they've been delaying it for so long ahahaha
Jack’s face @ 13:37
Gonna be crazy when they make this a safety car
Somehow this car will find its way into a Need For Speed game, stolen from the good guys by the bad guys so on and so forth.
I Need It
Am I the only one who noticed, he looks like sebastin vettel on the side 4.03
Sounds great. No where near as close to as fast as the rimec nevera
0-62kph in 2.9..... same as a MC20 and the MC20 is a better looking car.
Haha thought it was a Mazda until I saw the badge.
Now Chris Harris has to drive it
De weehickle
0-200 < 6s**
The best or nothing
Yeah, but does it porpoise?
Rip off McLaren P1 🤦
2:00 horsepower war become much more absurd now. Do you really need all That 1000 hp? Even an SUV now got 700 hp (Jeep TrackHawk). They great when you drag racing them or doing a track day in a high speed race track, but I guess most of you did not need that much.  My 2008 Corvette Z06 with 505 hp LS7 even a bit too much for me (but I keep learning to tame it & improve the handling), but great speed & torque while exiting corner & in straight line.   I guess around 400-450 hp is enough for daily driven cars & some weekend track action.
The Porsche CGT was first with F1 engine!
This car looks like Clarkson in an Ariel
So they went to all this effort and it's not the best in any stat? Disappointing
I wonder if I’ll ever be able to afford this…
Now that is an exciting car not the other 1800+ BHP hypercar wanna be
Good job showing the hosts face 98% of the time instead of the car. They didn’t show us any of the car!! Awful video!!
Iam going crazy driving my renault with 131 hp. What in this world would i do with 1063hp, probably fly to the moon
Woow. I agree!! ….whatever….
Pointless twattery once again from the big car manufacturers.
"so you're not sticking these vents and just hope for the best!" that is the stupidest thing Ive ever heard from a reporter....
the review is all over the place… i feel like the host just asking random questions
I have 3 , one Forza !!! Sub to buy one 🫶🏻
What is that greenish-blue color called?
Surprised by the weight considering this was originally touted as a rival to the AM Valkyrie. Both the Valkyrie and T.50 seem much more focused but the AMG One has an air of compromise, amazing technology but for what purpose?
I need to ride in this car asap. Better yet, I need richer friends 😂
Would love to get behind the wheel of one of these and feel how Sir LH set up the chassis/suspension.  Drives fantastically on Forza, I know that much 😂
I was expecting it to obliterate everything on the road. It would in 2017.
Would this be a good birthday present for my girlfriend?
Jack looked real giddy when he got in.
Don’t let Manny Koshbin see this 😂
*And meanwhile BMW doesn’t even have a supercar in their roster…*
☝
This car looks like what happens when aston martin and mclaren have a baby
Both Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg already ordered two of them. Now both of them gonna continue their rivalry on the road 😂
Unpopular opinion.. the car really is not that special.. Nothing about it is revolutionary. It’s just evolving on what everyone else is doing
This top gear guy is such an annoyance. Cringe.
Dude can't even lie, knows this is behind the Aston and the T50.
The Ferrari SF90 has 1,000 HP, takes only2.5s to 100KMPH. cost $500k, not $3m. You figure.
I haven't watched TG since Clarkson left. This guy reminds me that was a wise choice.
yo
Now you can clearly see why Adrian Newey is on another level. Valkyrie eats this mercedes on breakfast for sure
Bryan Cranston made the AMG One?
Can't wait for Doug Demuro to review its quirks.
I love the looks and overall idea of the car but I don’t think its pushing the game as far as the Valkyrie nor the T50 racing version. And at 1700kg (plus driver weight) and ‘only’ 1060hp its going to get left in the dust by the lighter competition performance wise. In short the hype is greater than the execution (at least for now).
the music is horrendous
This is pretty disappointing, performance-wise.
Now I’m curious between this car and the Aston Martin Valkyrie I like the Mercedes Benz a lot but I love the Aston more I think it’s more raw than this car
Looks like a Noble M500
Honestly, the weight ruins the performance of the car. I am sure it will be nowhere near as good as f1 car or even the Valkyrie.
Not rob big sad
Saving up for one of these babies... in forza horizon 5
O I’m sorry I thought the bbc and this show folded ?
I love all the plebs whinging about weight and top speed and range as if they're actually in the market for a hypercar lol. It's like saying you don't fancy Gal Gadot's new hairstyle. So the wedding's off, then, is it?
Hasn't Porshe and Ferrari done this before?
Hypercars are getting crazier and crazier! The Koenisegg Yesko, the Valkyrie, the T.50, the F5.  I know Ferrari is already working on the LaFerrari replacement.  Porsche should be preparing a 918 replacement, and McLaren must be working on a P1 succesor, I would call it Pole.   This car looks way better than the CLK GTR, but still is weird, specially the back even though they tryied to hide it using black paint. I have a Toyota 86, it is usable, it is light, it is cheap and simple.  Cars have to go back to basics, like a Miata.  911s are great but just too complicated, they have lost some soul, that is the reason why guys like Singer, are charging tens of thousands for their resto mods.
Great, must be POne. Is a Hypercar?
For all of the touting of the hybrid systems and electric motors, I'd expect better off the line performance than a Bugatti Chiron....
If this car isn't the new safety car in F1 next season, I'm gonna be very disappointed
This car literally gives me zero emotions, seems lost in a sea of hypercars that are just fancy spreadsheets, nothing more.
Somewhere in Sweden Christian Von Koenigsegg is watching this video thinking "Hypercar? That's cute"
Interesting car, uninteresting presentation
Weehicle
I hope the engine doesnt blow up in malaysia
Uninterested in more talk.... 🥱
Feels like it's almost one of the homologation cars for GT1......not quite the CLK GTR successor though
All credit to the Uk for being the Platform for the Manufacture Process.
Finally the production Jaguar C-X75. It’s only 10 years late.
I remember applying for this car a long time ago (Mercedes turned me down). I checked my IG post about it and the letter was dated May 10, 2017. It’s been 5 years since allocations (and ding letters) were made. That’s a long time to wait. Frankly, I think I would rather have the screaming V10 that Mercedes supplied in 2005 but hey, if I’d gotten an allocation, I’m sure I’d be happy with the 2016 F1 powerplant.
0 to 100 km/h 2.9 wtf all this years for that numbers a bmw m5 gonna smoke this easly
Getting mine deliverer as we speak
Looks to me that they're copying koenigsegg, haha!
A electric motor just for the turbos 😭 my God Almighty.
Koenigseg killer.
Looks like a simple enough drivetrain. 😂
Let me guess, all models have been spoken for and there is a 5yr waiting list
Not pritty at ALL
Lmao how bad can you be as a presenter/interviewer, fr man rushing those questions and not letting the guy talk to say shit Not to speak trash on the 'new' Top Gear just because but weird energy
AMG ONE! car jet💪
Hey Jack, U totally forgot to mention the  1.6 V6 motor with its  11,000 rpm redline. ! 🤷🏻‍♂️
Bruh the motor just to spin up the turbo is already more powerful than the actual engine in my car
And the slave drivers of Dubai get a new toy.
What is the price?.
I wonder if it will porpoise in the straights too
Can't wait to see it not being driven by their owners and being garage ornaments
They shouldve called an italian to design it, germans dont really have imagination in terms of design.
Like a jet fighter pilot you must be an adept system manager
3750 lbs, overweight like current F1 cars.
Holy smokes
F1 technology… 1700kg. What? 💀 💀 💀
3 million for those numbers? Nah...
Its been "soo long" that it feels old already, and what? lackluster? I dont know, I think the valkyrie is more "striking" in my opinion and the T.50 is more "sexier" but who I am, I dont have the money to buy one lmao
The newest crop of hypercars is NOT a meaningful advancement from the LaFerrari/918/P1 trio of 10+ years ago. These cars will be faster yes, but only because they are more race car and less street car. Slapping number plates on your LMP1 car is not engineering. Peak automobile is no longer on the horizon, it happened ten years ago.
I love this veeheegle yah ....
Must have been depressing for them over 5 years to watch the Tesla cars get faster... and faster... and then... much faster.  Must be depressing for them to see Tesla's 6-seat mid-size SUV accelerate significantly faster than this combustion-engined dog.  The writing really is on the wall https://youtu.be/AFhzl84iAXw
I see Gemera Koeniggsegg🤔
Yawn...
Imagine spending that much money on something that goofy looking
Maybe I don't get it. But in my mind it is really heavy, not any faster than a 765 lt and hideously ugly.  Tech wise really impressive though.
Is it me or the sound wasn't ground breaking?
Mercedes AMG UGLY One -
Just watched this review and RBR’s review. Surprised to say that a one man show did it so much better than a whole production team of established TV crew in my opinion.
I love that the paint is a top of the hat to the livery of the formula car. Always loved that design personally. Glad they incorporated it in the car
Wait, it actually exists?
How many miles until the engine (powerunit) needs a rebuild?
we take that entire race-crew and put it in the car's computer, so as soon as you drive it off the lot your check engine light will go off and you have 35 codes come up at the dealer  and you can wear your mercedes cap watching f1 and feel like lewis hamillton tho lmao
Also wasnt this supposed to be lighter? I dont understand this car, it seems it is going to have excelent performance, but at the same time there isnt enough to differentiate from competitors. It seems similar to a 918 Spyder, but the 918 has been around for 9 years now. I expected more from Mercedes
F1 derived engine. Not an F1 engine.
That "thing" looks weird when you remind yourself that it's a Mercedes. I know, its exterior design was probably made having performance in focus, but that still doesn't change the fact that it feels like I'm looking at an AI-generated image of an "average hypercar".
How did you not use chris harris for this?
But does it porpoise like the F1 car?
Good luck to all on it's 1st oil change!!!
BBC grifter still pretending there was a global pandemic.
Genuinely curious - How it will sound in the real world if one drives past me someday - It's an extremely exotic engine.. so servicing intervals? ordering parts? & cost? - What sort of mileage can this vehicle do (if a madman used this as his/her daily) before it would need major work (eg engine rebuild)
So, I am 100% a self proclaimed petrol head, but I would be pretty ticked getting gapped at a stop light by a Model S plaid if I had a car that looked like that.  I'd hope the cost of the car is sub $200k because if its anywhere near  $500k or more...a jetpowered batmobile sold for around $680k. That being said I'm not the demographic I live paycheck to paycheck...
Don't look at my name""""
I'll buy it when gas price drops below 5$
Looks remarkably similar to a McLaren f1 no?
Oh I thought this was a proper old-school Top Gear re-post.... *unsubs*
A f1 engine is all fine and dandy until you realise it is the engines that sound bland compared to how they did over 17 years ago
Love the exterior and drive train tech, but that interior is from 5 years ago which would be fine if you haven't sat in Mercedes latest products which have amazing interiors. It's also unfortunate that in the time they've taken to develop this car all the competitors have caught up and gone even better... So excited for this car a few years back but now, not as much...
Wow what a beautiful machine.
Well, they certainly had to hurry up and get this thing out finally. In this declining market, this thing would not sell a year from now. I still think of this thing always was and is a stupid idea. I don’t get it and I never will. My million dollars will go towards a better Mercedes super car, otherwise known as the Valhalla.
I hope its hybrid system feels exciting like the 918 rather than the clinical-feeling SF90
You say one of the electric motors is used only to spin up the turbo and eliminate lag. I'm going to throw the BS flag on that. I could be wrong, but would love to hear someone explain how a turbo needs 122 horsepower to start spinning.
This is so cool!
This guy is so stiff that I just couldn't keep watching...  for F sake, lighten the F up!
Now this is a car that is actually stylish
this car looks phenomenal, but why the heck are the displays and the animations inside looking like it could be from an a-class 6 years ago. And what was that input lag when you push the touchsreen, which you can see in the end. Is it so hard to put a faster processor or just a better software engineer on a 2.4 mil car?
This car seems to have a very complex design. I won't be surprised if it breaks down often.
The topgear journalist is meh
For the price tag the Hennessey f5 is a better car.
Jack's very excited, and dressed like a tramp. Did he rock up to this gig on the way home from a rave?
Kinda looks like a walrus
Hilarious comments
lmfao its performance specs are comparable to a c8 corvette lmfao
I so wish i could drive this just to see what it feels like
Optional wheels on a car that expensive…
I was waiting for this one for a long time
Should’ve modernized the ClK Gtr’s frontend and bubble headlamps, these headlamps look like Hyundai trying too hard  other than this is really nice. Tail lamps scream Lamborghini. What happened to the days when super cars all had their very own swag.
Original weight intended 1200 kg.. Production unit weight 1700 kg 😄😄 What will you say to the customer? It is slightly overweight about 500 kg ...Good luck with that..The " ASTON MARTIN VALKYRIE " weight 1200 kg.
I don’t want to brag or anything but I own this car in GTA 5
This had better be their return to the Hypercar category for Lemans!!!
I hope Mercedes add a porpoising element too to this hypercar. 😀
122hp electric motor just for the turbo. That's more than the entire output of many cars. I love the way Marco pronounces 'vehicle. Na, I don't think I'll get the optional magnesium wheels, it will make the car too expensive.
I wonder how bad the porpoising is on the straights ?
Vehicle
overhyped as hell. It’s Mercedes’ ugly overpriced (they’re all expensive) answer to the holy trinity.
Nice Air Max ones
This is hard to watch, literally anyone could have presented this better, the things he was saying 😂
Think the guys on coke
Aston Martin Valkyrie is a better car if you have the money to buy both. The Aston looks and sounds better. Plus, you won’t have as many engine issues as the Merc.
I’ve been waiting years to see this thing drive. We’ve seen enough talking about the damn thing
Camera man is not good at all, clearly there's a lack of preparation overall.  Car looks nice tho
my car whats it doing on here lol x
All fun and games until the MGU-K or MGU-H stops working 🔥
That DRY weight figure is a joke
British English: the vehicle German English: the ve-HE-cle  This guy: THE VEHITLER
Putting an F1 power unit in a car isn't really impressive when you look at the competition i.e. NA V12s that scream to 11,000 rpm
The Valkyrie is infinitely better than this thing in every way
Psh been driving this car in forza for almost a year😂
Sweet! Every time someone has put an F1 engine in a road car, it's been brilliant and not a disappointing / unreliable flop. It is pretty, though.
Cool I’d still rather have a P1 any day of the year
A street car called Desire.
Did anyone catch what this weighs Feels like it would be a pig
So much heavier than I thought it would be.
Looks like they took a lot of aero elements from Porsche engineering.
More like Mercedes OMG!!! It looks awesome!
Easy decision to buy one if you have $3 million, you'll get a great return on your investment and use it while you hold it long enough so Mercedes doesn't flag you as a flipper.
Wonderful wehicle
The AMG one is just a bit underwhelming from the looks of it in this video. SF90 has about the same power, faster 0-60, around the same kerb weight (which is also interesting, since sf90’s chasis is aluminum and the AMG one has a carbon tub), cost significantly less and much more available (well, as available as a top of the line Ferrari can be, need to buy a Roma to get allocated one) Yeah it’s probably slower around the track, but who cares, go buy a dedicated race car, like a proper GT3 car for significantly less money and better track performance.   So for the 2.3mil price tag on this car, you can buy a 300k well equipped Roma for the allocation of sf90, buy a tailor made sf90 for 700k to perform just as good if not better than the AMG one on the street, buy a 458 gt3 for 300k for better track performance and still have a full 1mil on hand to do whatever. And that is given you don’t sell the Roma immediately to recoup some money. In other word, I don’t see a point to the AMG one other than bragging rights.   Amg’s electrified ventures so far has been very lackluster if not down right awful (gt63e, AMG one, upcoming c63s). As a owner and long time fan of amgs (currently own GTC, GT63s, S65c, SL65, used to have SL63, CLS63s), I’ve been very disappointed and not hopeful for amg’s future. Was initially gonna upgrade the GT63s to gt63e, but the hybrid  was such a disappointment; s coupe, one of my favorite model, discontinued with no foreseeable comeback; GT two door and SL gets butchered and combined into a Frankenstein’s monster of a 2+2 soft top; having had over 10 years of being their customer and having bought 6 cars, I wasn’t even offer the opportunity to buy a GT bs without a 100k+ markup, let alone the AMG one. What exactly is going on with AMG these days? Guess I’m switching to Ferrari. At least I can get a sf90 spider by just ordering a Roma and resell it.
I normally don't care about hyper cars, but the Aston Martin Valkyrie and this are SICK :o 🔥
all well and good having done thousands of kilometres in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Spain but has it been tested in rural Northampton with its potholes with occasional sections of road?
Looks like a McLaren F1
seems incredible thay murray managed to get the t50 below 1000kg
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW EXPENSIVE THE  SERVICE ON THAT CAR WILL BE
I wanna see this race against the Aston Martin Valkyrie
Developing your regular Mom and Dad Honda Civic is easily more expensive than an F1 car development cycle just to get the reliability and idiot-proofness that you would need for a production car. The effort that went into developing a road-legal F1 car must’ve been insane
1700 kg? Wow, what a disappointment. The Valkyrie will s**t all over this.
Junk
This and the Valkyrie having taken way longer than expected to get into production. Shame it weighs so much and isn’t rwd only
My grandma has 1000hp
Show pony  But technology came too late  And too complicated
Expecting nothing short of a record at the ring.
nice
Um ,hate to say it but time has not favored this now old car.  aside from owning a rare merc, this car has fallen by the wayside before its even been sold, As it sat int he oven far too long.  Other marques have come along and are far more desirably.  Aston Martin Valkyrie Gordon Murray T50, an all new lineup of Lambo's Koenigeggs, Ferrari's, Pagani's all about to drop.  while this now looks old and long in the tooth.  More over it looks like an very late model Koenigsegg CC .  sure it will have the bells and whistles but it wont be the most modern of cars either.  F1 or not, if it doesnt deliver the promise of the sound of F1 then its simply a failure.
Dang they made the car from Forza a real thing
What a beautiful design
Why didn’t they start and rev the engine? What are they afraid of? Turnkey AMG F1 detonation?
if this doesn’t set the nurburgring lap record i’ll be disappointed
Nice, but I’d rather have either Valkyrie or Evija.
She sure is pretty. Though I'm more excited about the soon to be released Chevrolet Corvette Z06 with its flat plane crank V8.✌🏻🇺🇸
I'll be honest the front badge ruins it for me
Its finally here 🙌🏿
Don't forget to thank your producer for the matching green jacket 👍
Thought that was Jack Rix round the track😂.
1700kgs 1.6l engine. I’m sorry, no.
Really nice weeehicle
Interested to see this vs a 911 gt2rs around a track
Rear looks like Aventador and Bugatti
Wehicle is Vehicle , i was soo confused at first , i had to turn the subtitles on
Junk. I will stick with my trackhawk. Ta
Ok that’s stunning
copied Aston with the painted emblem, I wonder if ppl are bashing the yolk style steering wheel as they did with the Tesla plaid
does it come with porpoising?
Wu-he-cal!! Love it!! What a machine, Mercedes killed it! That things nasty!!
Something doesn’t look right with those headlights.
Not impressed with the weight. It's heavier than a 918 spyder. Horspower figures while impressive,  isn't a lot. An SF90 is down by 63hp but also weighs less and half the price. This makes the Valkyrie even better value. It has a bigger engine (not to mention a glorious one) and weighs A LOT less. Respect to mercedes for making the car tho.
This thing looks nuts
Bad Idea for a drinking game: rewatch this and drink whenever they say "element"
It look like a seagull
Pritty... useless.
I think someone mention this car will had overheat issue years ago, I am kinda curious how they solved that
What a beautiful weeheecle
1,700kgs yiiiikes.
Does it have a porposing problem?
Finallllly. If this lives up to it, this is going to be long worthwhile.
Crazy that this car took so long to make, the screens and user interface are from the previous generation!
Wow...Mercedes has always been my favourite marque.
0-60 2.9.and this is supposed to be a shock ??? Car??
Wow! Absolute perfection 👌
Home of x8 World Champions. Uhhh gawd this is absolutely bonkers! 😍 HammerTime!
Rip off. You make a hypercar that weighs 1700kg and charge people over 2 million? What’s amazing about that???
1.7t of over complicated weight, and this ugly painted mb star OMFG LOL. amg sorry but i want that legendary renault space f1 with that v10 and wheels who screech power, to bring kids to school.
It's a porker but it looks so great and fast...
Compare this to any other hypercar and this doesn't look good. Even tho Mercedes has to most money to develop one.
makes me so proud to be apart of the Mercedes family
This car makes sense about 6 years ago
My favorite of the new hypercars. So happy to see this actually becoming reality!
Imagine this running on biofuel, green hydrogen or/and e fuels, it will be awesome and good for the environment. 🤩🤩🏎️♻️
Video game presentation of AMG One 👋
Is that really how he says the word VEHICLE!?!? I’m a hearing him right? Is he trying to say vehicle..
This is yuuuuuge
"Weehicle"😂
WuHEEcle
gets smoked by a tesla plaid with giant panel gaps
Y most hyper cars look the same
I'll only buy one if I can drive it in front wheel drive electric mode only.
Wtf? What a colossal fail !!! From Mercedes !! 1700 kg !!! 😂😂😂😂 Joke !! Slower than an sf90 Slower than a 9/11 to sixty ?  Wasn't it meant to be 2.1 to 60 ??  The latest technology ? What's the point if it's 1700 kg ?  Will be absolutely slaughtered by a Valkyrie.  Colossal fail.
I was going to buy the GR86 but now I changed my mind...
Really good review Jack, from the look on your face, I think I can safely say you enjoyed making this video, nice job.
It looks like competition for the Aston Martin Valkyrie
As a racing fan, I really don't care much about supercars, my thinking always has been to just go and buy a LMP3 or F4 instead of a super car. But this one just looks so incredibly awesome. I love the steering wheel, the aero, the looks, I would buy one in a heartbeat given the chance.
I wanna see this vs the evija which weighs about the same also has 4 electric motors and over 1900hp but no ICE.  I think the ice age is basically now over and this matchup will prove it beyond any doubt. 🤔
Wow, it's finished.  And ugly.
No engine start up?  Fail
In the age of biblical sounding Aston & Gordon Murray V12 hypercars, this Prius powered star is dead on arrival.
The Mercedes guy said a word “veheetle?” several times and I have no clue what he’s saying.
You made a video about an F1 powered hypercar and made it boring
Wow that’s a nice looking wehitlle lol
You lost me at Mercedes
it was worth the wait...
Announced in some articles STILL to be 1200 kg and change. Overpromise...underdeliver?
Anti-Stall...?
As someone who can (probably) never afford any of these hyper cars being made, I think this is my favourite of the lot.
"weeheecle"
Not a very attractive design
Recent saw one with a different but similar plate.  LB 0698
Porsche 918 Spyder from 7 years ago looks better in my opinion.
Amazing ”wahicle”
5 years too late.
What should always happen when you TALK about CAR... Hear IT... I was waiting all the time of this Episode to hear the Sound of it...and I didn't 🙄❗ You Can't speaks about car like this without Noise....shame.....
700-800kg more than the F1 cars with the same total power, just for the extra seat, roof and lights :)
They’ve been hyping this car for at least a decade I think
I prefer the Koenigsegg jesko
1700 kg, it will be a huge task to get good lap times out of it. Will it even beat a modest but well established Porsche GT2 that has 700 hp? Let alone their own GTR?
What's the story with it being made in the UK ?
I can't say for sure..if I'm not chasing a real one
610hp of motor  11 mile range 800v DC battery at 8.4kwh.  That's only 10aH worth of storage.  Those motors must be drawing next to no current or you only get 1063 for a number of seconds/ minutes.
This is a heavy car. 1695 kilos while its main competitor the Valkyrie is around 1275 kilos with more power and probably similar levels of downforce I know this is AWD but idk if that will make up for 420 kilo disadvantage. Either way I'm glad cars like this are being made happy to see AMGs work being paid off
1700 kilos?!?  It’s a veritable porker… Way heavier than I was expecting. As heavy as my sedan, for that matter.
Phenomenal
Oh please. This car won’t be enjoyed for its driving experience. No. This is another case of catering to rich people. Seven figures and already sold out before hardly anyone even knew about their existence. These are going to be parked and hidden away from the world. I’ll be shocked if any of these cars reach over 5000 miles on their clocks. This is so excessive and unrelatable. These cars are so out of touch with your average enthusiast that it doesn’t excite me or interest me in the least. Maybe then again I just don’t know what it’s like to be rich enough to blow a million on a car. I bet the average buyer has several dozen million dollar cars… and houses… and yachts… and planes… and mistresses… next.
What an awful, gimmicky lashup. This thing is everything that's wrong with modern supercars x1000.
But will it beat the New Tesla?
So heavy! And barely more power than the Ferrari SF90. Heavier than the 2013 Porsche 918 and that one could have been this much power easily, let alone today.
It’s so heavy.
the size of these naca ducts damn
The stats are kinda disappointing, 0 - 60 in 2.9, nowadays 4 door saloons do that (M5 cs, porche Panemera turbo s etc). Also only 219 mph... What a joke 😅
You know that the electric hands-down power Wise close it away and it’s just a matter of time before the rain hits much farther than any ice F1
Yoke is a joke
That car is 😯🔥🔥🔥
i have this car in fh5 its alright very well made. handles like no other stock car
Terrible idea to try to make it an F1 derived engine. Just makes no sense. Why did they think it would work fine right away?
Will still get smoked buy some teenager in a '98 Honda Civic
Will this fly like the old mb gt
Be still my heart
Woulda been so cool if the real top gear had been able to play with this
Why call it the One if power to weight isn't 1:1 like the Koenigsegg? Still a sweet car, for sure. I wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating toast.
mercedes badge airbrushed on like a 70s rapey van wizard
You already know Manny is going to get one
Props to Mercedes for sticking with it and finding a way to make the f1 engine work but there is a reason why race cars use racing engines and street cars using street engines. After 5 years of hard work, we are left with an over weight, over complicated car whose only claim to fame is using a neutered f1 engine. I’d rather have a 918 spyder, la Ferrari, ford GT, and pagani or Bugatti, etc
Looks alright, but I think I'll stick with my current beast and dream car. A beautiful Peugeot 306 HDI estate, simply an amazing car and unlike a flashy new Merc. Has a unique weight distribution technology, so the faster it goes the more bits fall off to save on weight.
What type of fuel octane options can it run on
Now do a LMDh version of it
1.7T! Geez she’s heavy.
I know some guys from a brand called TVR that didn't asked for a wind tunnel to have cuts above the wheel arches..
17:13 pretty sure people that own this car do not have neighbours 😂 they will be living in private mansions
Finally a worthy replacement for my 96 Civic.
Let's hope its performance makes up for the fact its absolutely hideous looks-wise. Not sure what is worse, this carp fish of a car, or Gordon's lazy T.50 where basically just made a lazy and ugly clone of his F1 that is compatible with today's car safety legislation rather than designing something actually new and visually striking and/or pretty like the Valkyrie.
Was hoping to hear how it sounds. Hopefully track mode also increases the idle revs.
Nothing special besides the t50 or Valkyrie
Not wanting to take away from the task of a project manager -  but he is definitely not a marketing guy.  So much stuff that makes this car unique but it all revolves on ‚complicated‘. Then again the are sold already so nothing to loose nothing to gain I guess.
ngl not really a fan
Looks really cool with the exception of that shark fin on the rear with AMG Performance written on it.
I remember when an AMG badge on a Benz use to be cool. Now it's just stuck on everything.
Damn, I could just by a c7 z06 manual and go 0-60mph in 2.9secs… just more proof that the F1 v6 hybrid systems are a letdown over the classic V12, V10🫠, and V8 cars
Can we get Chris Harris to take one of these to the track :)
I hope this doesn't porpoise as bad as the W13 ;)
Built in the 🇬🇧 UK 😀
Me over here with my Mercedes that makes 200hp and just sprung an oil leak😵‍💫😂
Is the host on stimulants? He's been very twitchy in this episode and erratic with his posture.
Big head. He must be smart.
Hypercars are getting more and more nutty, and I absolutely love it!
T50 weighs 986kg. This weighs 1700kg; shockingly over 700 kg more. Regardless of the power differential, the AMG One is just too heavy.
Might buy a couple....
Batmobile
maybe make a 276th one for the new F1 Safety Car?
This car doesn't make sense. The power train is from a car that weighs like 700kg, and yet this car weighs 1700kg. How can two extra electric motors on the front wheels, more bodywork, an extra seat and interior plus maybe a thing or two here and there result in 1000kg extra weight? It just doesn't make sense.  0-100km/h is 2.9 seconds, which let's be real yes it's fast but in today's world that is slower than a tesla or countless supercars. What exactly are you paying for here, beyond the hype that it has an engine from an f1 car?
A little underwhelmed tbh. This was meant to break new ground but outside of the whole F1 engine novelty it's basically a new awd McLaren P1. I would guess that the Senna runs this close on a track. I'm confident the Valkyrie is much faster.
I know it’s an amazing car. But the guy explaining everything is very dry.
The Porche Carrera GT is already an example of what happens when an F1 engine is put into a road car
They'd have to cam it down a bit.   F1 like don't like to idle.
IMO Having watched a 1955 Gullwing video yesterday and commenting on how incredible the styling was, even the modern GT Benz is amazing looking.....this car is not anything like those. Design fail for me
Probably just get a Model S Plaid instead.  Not like many could afford this, if they weren’t sold out.
I dont get it.
It's beautiful yes.  However, the elephant in the room.  It's significantly overweight for its brief, and it's not particularly fast in a straight line compared to its rivals.
Scamdemicc you mean.
How many engine penalties would you have to take every season to keep up that performance 🤔
that's Toto Wolff's nice cousin
They waited so long they aren't dominant and seen as the top dogs anymore. Lol
Siema krejzol z tego merca
When compared to the Valkyrie it seems very boring and antithesis of a F1 car except for the powertrain. But compared to an AMG GT it is an extreme hypercar. Infact it is the AMG GT of hypercars for all the good/bad that that means.
Mercedes states that you only get 3 allotments of the MGU-H before you incur a penalty.
The real question is; will they take it to the Nurburgring to try and set a new lap record?
I’m so glad not to see Jeremy especially after seeing SLH
I've been using the AMG ONE in Forza Horizon 5 and it's amazing! Obviously just a video game but it's the closest I'll ever be to actually driving this car lmao
1700kg...good lord. Well that's going to be underwhelming next to the t50 and Valkyrie
back good but front like  a frog
All the Mercedes F1 team haters are in full force here today
Shame non of them will ever be driven
Built in Germany.
So an F1 engine in a vehicle that ways 1700kg, what’s the point of that? Seems like the hybrid part isn’t just a feature, but necessary…
1000hp is going to be normal in 30 years .
Se algum br comprar, me chama pra ir ver o carro? Obrigado
We are living something SPECIAL !
Great, but has Mercedes the porpoising been fixed? Lol
hope it drives better than the actual mercedes f1 car
T.50 > Valkyrie > this
i‘m going to get this car.
Cant decide if i buy one or if i stay with my Honda Civic🤔
Fat boy car, yucks who needs these fat and unnecessary heavy Abominations, simply buy a Caterham or an X-Bow and get the ride of your life. Only good for bragging in the Pub. And after the 10x Time bragging you will go home with your head in a pint glass. OHHH the engine was driven by lewis 'Who shaved my Balls - Russel!!!' Hamifart. I rather would like to have a new engine.
The Gemera is more impressive, sorry Mercedes-Benz.
Does it come with porpoising too?
Fresh Nike Air Max…the cars nice too 🙌🏽
That's a big elise
Anyone know which jacket Jack is wearing? Really like it lmao
Aston martin look closer to f1 car but I guess everything they put in here can’t be fitted in that chassis 😂 plus all the regulation homologation emission etc. no new fun car will pass this 🥲
Just AMAZING! German engineering 😍💯🙏🏽
Ugly, scowling and overweight seems like the one shares more qualities with a Lufthansa flight attendant than an F1 car
i have this in gta
Please if you hear me out, make more of these cars than 300. Make this car the legacy it is meant to be. This car will be like the holy grail of the combustion car era. It will likely be the highest engineered car of this time, the top notch of the era of combustion cars. Please let this car be as great as it can be, as it will likely be the last extreme over engineered sports car before we begin the new era of cars. Its like the CLK GTR or the Mclaren F1 or even greater.
imagine one day came where 1069 horsepowers is considered low
Rather have a natural V8!
how often was the release of it delayed? i can t remember how often...
Is it wrong that I would modify it 🤔
Cup-holders?
Mercedes already showing their George Russell favouritism. They could've made it 1044hp but they chose to make it 1063hp
Feel like this project has missed the boat. Whilst they were figuring out how to make this work, the likes of Ferrari brought out a Hybrid 'production' car with almost the same power for a third of the price.
Already timeless. Incredible. 10/10 for Merc!
Made in UK 🇬🇧 BOOM
It sounds like crap.
WEE HEE KYL
I'm so glad I didn't watch the video, I kept skipping trying to hear it lol top gear is just too much poop without the bois
Bmw..lol
Looks like some big fat guy sat on a toad   that was sitting on a Taycan.
someone has been looking at Koeningsegg.......
It's kinda sad that these cars will just end up being garage queens for rich collectors.
Wow, great, another car for the 0.001% of the population.
Too heavy  Take a Gordon Murray or Koenigsegg ahead anyday  Even the large Jesko is ~1400kg and has  16000 horses...  Only at very high speed when aero is really squashing down the car do these heavy things make sense. On roads and shorter tracks the T50 will smash it and put more smiles on the face
So is this like an Aston Martin Valkyrie rival?
Yo, maybe youll recognize the shape of this extractor wheel and all the benefits what is it for.  - it looks fantastic.  give him just a photo for the poser
Yoke steering wheel like the Plaid baby⚡🔥 2023 Roadster 🚀🇺🇸
This _weikle_ is impressive.
It's such a pity it looks terrible
I feel like the Aston makes this feel dated already somehow.
On par or Slower to 62 than a Porsche 911 Turbo S, should be 2 flat or less for £2.5m.
This car honestly seems underwhelming for price. It think it missed its mark by a few years. Lucky they already pre sold them.
I still prefer an SF90…
Finally!
but when do you get to test drive it?
The only thing it this car might excel at is a track. But the number aren’t there to even impress me to want to see it track. Really lack luster for the long wait. An expensively over priced amg once again. And doesn’t even fit the f1 inspired dream they had. They failed really
BRUH 1700KG   also nearly 500 bhp from electric means. that F1 engine (obviously) heavly limited "only" ca. 550 bhp compared to nearly 1000 in f1
Already looks dated, tech is already obsolete plus they’ve released it right when Mercedes has begun its f1 decline. Decision making straight out of Ferrari playbook
F1 engines are not particularly sexy these days so that for me is not a selling point, Valkyrie’s V12 is far more impressive.  It’s quite an ugly car unfortunately….and why is there a pit lane limiter on a road car?? 😂.
So this update is not diff than any other. A car that isn’t moving or being started...  Why not just wait until they let you use it on a track. So much about the sound of an F1 engine and can’t even hear it
A little under 1700 kg dry??  Damn this cars a porker
Ah an f1 engine, must have it so the car would be lighter oh.. wait...no.
Amazing car but why does this masseuse talk about cars?🤦🏻‍♂️
How does this compare with the aston martin valkyrie  in cornering speeds. Would it be faster?
So it's basically a slightly newer and uglier version of the Porsche 918
It looks like it murdered Steve Irwin
I'm surprised that this car is a full second slower 0-60 then the Tesla plaid. It does have a 45mph faster top speed though
That's one hell of a Wee-hekle
I was working on this car more than 3 years ago, nice to finally see it being finished 😊👍🏼
You did a whole documentary about this car without starting it up?
I just think it represents a modern interpretation of a Mclaren P1. The battle of the 1000hp hypercar hybrid was nearly 10 years ago with the trilogy.  Great to see it come to light, but i worry its a little too late.
Amg one looks pale next to the T50.
It’s the Kriger from gta
I want those air max 1s. Only thing I’ll ever be able to afford from this video
They should have sent an engineer to interview the lead engineer. My guy doesn't even know what to do with the answers
Still limited by the speed limit.
Looks like a Jesko!
Wow. This car’s performance is way more disappointing than I anticipated. Still gorgeous though.
I geting same filing amount Senna's testing and cooperation on NSX project back in that day more because Senna is Lewis idol...
this man talks like a robot 😂
those abu dhabi track footage is real,not CGI..? because nowadays CGI so real, sometimes hard to tell is video game or real car.
It's been in Forza for a while. I was wondering when AMG was gonna debut it
The Global PlanDemic
Imagine the feeling when a valkerye drives past.
That dude is a mini Toto Wolff
Why dont go with bare F1 engine without electrity mumbos jumbos for lightweight
haha, I see the train and see 918. Hear you talking about its no plugin hybrid and hear LaFerrari. I watch the active susp and aero and watch the P1. Maybe is suspended more like the GT not 40.  Maybe the other delayed Valk ll be more original.
S85 has entered the chat
1063…thats savage from AMG
What a time to be alive
Eeek that’s heavy
I can't imagine anything less cool than having to use an App to work out how to drive your car..  heading straight for the"Seriously Uncool" section of Top Gears own cool wall, sorry
What a horrible review the car doesn't even look real and it seems like the guy knows it or maybe he's just not good at his job
This has taken forever to get out and probably still a while before we see any customer cars. However, it does seem pretty cool. I love the race mode where it changes so much
They have to have a raw version of this on the drawing board somewhere
I must say that i dont like design of this vijeKle
We need more details
This is the endgame!!A tombstone for all competitors!!AMG and Mercedes are at least 15 whole years ahead of everyone else!!This is history!!
"Top Gear Editor" presenting   Things have gone downhill quite badly
Front end looks very similar to the Porsche 918...?!
Why is it so ugly?....
Was debating this for months. Either a 1997 Honda Civic or this. I’ve finally made my decision.
The way he says vihicle
It looks like Bugatti and Porsche made it 🤔
Basically they made a 918 overpriced 918 and about 10 years late but a 918 all the same .No quicker ,no lighter no more advanced iff you dont count 2 kph .it is good looking but then so was the 918.
What a technical marvel however it's not a beautiful car imo and the use of screens rather than a designed instrument cluster will age the car and just looks plan.
Where are the under 6 Seconds to 124 miles per hour from 2017?
Less impressed now sadly
Ima say it cause no one else will. Jack coming through with the drip. Man's apple watch strap is matching his jacket.
...3700 pounds ain't exactly light 😕
All these cars just go to jeffery Epsteins and oil baron sheiks. how endearing
The "F1" engine isn't better than the v12 in the Aston Martin..
Can't wait for the Mercedes-AMG III.
Gonna need to see some lap times…
thats why Rimac made hundreds of millions,now every major company stealing that tech and wauuu..look.. my kok is bigger than yours.
There's never been a better time to spend your lunch breaks watching YouTube videos about insane cars. Something to be grateful for.
This car looks like a mclaren had sex with with a pagani, not really mercedes. I think Elon Musk should get involved
I want to hear clarkson talk about it. About how its got more power than a sun, and is as slippery as an eel coated in vegetable oil, a powertrain as complicated as an interstellar spaceship's.
5 min in and hes listed off a bunch of specs with no mention of the internal combustion engine specs
Im just so glad that manny koshbin is getting one so we can watch it in his vlogs😊
He didnt even provide specs on the main engine
Poo
Mercs are the favorite vehicle for taxi drivers across Europe
For two and a half mil, this better be the best big boy toy money can buy.
How boring TG became, you need the expert holding his hand kinda selling the car instead of study the car for a more dramatic presentation. I miss the good old days of TG
I don't see any porposing, must not actually be a Merc.
It's awesome. Looks mean yet sophisticated has impressive performance and last but not least has a fricking F1 engine in the back. This will go down as one of the all time greats. Happy this is AMG's way off showing off and not some puke inducing SUV which the bavarians deemed worthy
Big wing mirrors.
It's 1700kg. I remember then the Mercedes SLR came out and everyone said it was too fat to compete with the focused Enzo and Carrera GT. They were right, at least on track. However also about 1700kg it was designed to be this super easy to drive two pedal comfy luxury car with a big boot, totally usable everyday. No matter what they say in this video about the 'practicality' of some Mercedes family switch gear (read: cost savings like the SLR) isn't this supposed to be a track focused dynamic weapon? With an engine and driving position, racing style steering wheel like that? So yes, this seems oddly heavy. That's where the Valkyrie and T.50 probably walks all over this on a track and driving enjoyment as they are less compromised on weight. If this is heavier as it is supposed be more usable it doesn't look it.
Is that the krieger from gta lol
Whee-he-cuhl
Beautiful but obsolete before it was ever built.
1700kg dry??? SMH
Ah yes! This car is appear on Forza Horizon 5
Its a stunning weehecile
tbh i'm a little bit disappointed with the stats. 2.9s to 100km/h, 7s to 200km/h. For a car that costs as much as this it's rather disappointing. When the car was first presented they told us it would make 0-200km/h in under 6s...The only cool thing this car has is the F1 Engine, but i bet the Valkyrie or T50 are going to be faster and more fun.
Turbo charged slug looking thing . GM v12 na all the way for me . If I could afford it .
Danm sad that Mercedes took away salomondrin's spot for one
Just dont get why the top speed is limited. And w the hybrid powertrain only does a 2.9 sec 0-62.
1700kg… they’re taking the piss. That’s what a 911 targa weighs and 911 is already obese. Just absurd in a world where not much more than a tonne for a super car is easily achievable.
So it's over 200 kg heavier than a P1?.........
Anyone else get a Matt Watson older brother vibe off this guy ?
Ok I am trading in my GTI for this AMG one 😅
Finally witnessing history
Ugly car looking The front
glad it's finally here! Looks and sounds amazing. Only question, if the inspiration was to include as much F1 experience as possible why not have a central seating position?
This is gonna look so cool sitting in some millionaire’s garage….
Cant believe they didnt yet found an elegant way to integrate  the tablets into the console....
immaculate design <3
Hopefully it doesn’t have porpoising problems
10’63’hp - George Russell 2022 F1 champion confirmed
In the headlines you never mention how many cylinders it has you are a CAR SHOW! Or at least used to be…
I vaguely remember this being announced at a target weight of like 1200 kg. Reality has not been kind, if my memory serves me right.
No lies, disappointed in this car. Where can we say this is class leading in the areas that matter. For 3M (approximately) a Jesko Is much more bang for the buck
you see I'm 6'6" would they be able to make one for me too?
does it have purposing to simulate 100% experience of f1?
I would like this car over any Ferrari.
The cars been so long in the making the world had moved on. The stats aren't that impressive any more.
still badass
this car should have came out like 5 years ago
I'm just going to wait for the  AMG TWO Kompressor 4-Matic Bi-Turbo S-Class 63
Ah i actually am not sure about the usage for this car . Its not faster than Bugatties and other cars on the drag race. It doesnt look that spectacular anymore as they had to delay the release , the design looks a bit outdated (not by much ofc) . But with the hype that they had around the car that has AN F1 ENGINE and power train , its only producing 1063 hp and does weight 1600kg. You might make a point about the track performance but it doesnt rly look like the fastest track car either . I might sound like i m hating but i am just pointing out the fact that the hype it had does not match the end product. They initially announced 0-100 in 2.2 seconds and 0-200 in under 6 seconds . The end product as Jack pointed out only goes from 0-100 in 2.9 and that depends on tyre and road conditions too. Given the price of the car you gotta rly consider wether customer would pick this car knowing all the aspects ,that dont rly match what they initially announced 5 years ago. Having Koenigsegg cars that have way better power to weight ratios and look more modern . I think the main selling factor that they will have to use is that this car has an F1 ENGINE , and that might actually have the value since its unique for a production car , even tho the performance does not rly match it.
I love the fact the body is not similar to any Mercedes. Finally great looking car by them.
2.9 to 100 KPH and 11 mile ev range. Hmm Lucid air - 2.5 and 500 miles of range.  cough.
I don't think there's been a time in history when so many wildly different strategies have been used to compete for the title of ultimate production car. This using F1 tech, the Valkyrie's big V12, the T.50 using fans, the Evija going full EV... we're going to have some amazing group tests over the next few years.
i own this car in forza horizon 5
“What would happen if you dropped an F1 powertrain into a road car?” Easy! If it’s the 2022 F1 powertrain, then it goes slower than all the competition. :-)
>First look >No Test drive Thats lame bruh.
I'll get 2 of those one's.  Thanks
what is the point to put a f1 engine , if the engine sound like vacuum cleaner ?
No talking about the enigine rather than just saiying "it's an F1 engine"? The Ferrari F50 was meant to have an F1 engine to but it didnt.
i'd take a GR 86 over this any day.  Have fun going 40 mph. It's reliable. Have fun with mods if you choose.   This AMG? meh ........i'd save the millions and use them on other memories/experiences
❤️💯
Bmw i8 was more impressive during release
New f1 safety car ??
i want to see track times now, so excited to see what performance it can deliver
Can I just mention how little I like this guy talking cars of any type? The f5, this, I just don't care for it. He doesn't capture the excitement or at least isn't quite able to describe via words to make you feel an emotion that properly describes each car.  If I'm top gear, and I'm going to Texas to drive a 2000hp Hennessy,  I phone Chris Harris.  I let Chris Harris drive and explain the feel and emotions.  He should be your go to.  I respect this guy, and what he does.  But I don't get the same enjoyment from these segments as I would with Harris or Matt Farrah or someone who understands what makes each car special and unique and how to make a person who will never own one feel a certain way.  Too much detached
I think Jack’s excellent jacket is of more interest. I get it, gen flex etc, but this embodies why the exact reason somebody paid 115 million for a simple but beautiful merc…. Simplicity
It would be nice if you get a presenter who can actually remember stuff without looking at their phone and ask some decent questions
I think it's meant for the racetrack!
I was disappointed with the sound.. I saw some videos of them testing at Nurburgring and the sound was pretty close to the f1 cars. It might not be a good sound for an f1 car but certainly a cool sound for a road car
only one thing missing, HALO
Not bad but better a V12 sounding Aston Valkyrie
That looks gruesome, like Clarkson in the Ariel Atom.
Hopefully they’ve sorted the porpoising on this as well
Ohh F1 Engine. Hammilton where are you😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
cracking
I stopped after weight was announced. This is ridiculous. T.50 will obliterate this so called f1 for the road xD
Tesla about this car: 🥺
Hmm, GMA T.50 for me please. 400hp and 650kg less. Still it is a very impressive weehickle.
Hehe Weehicle...
Insane 🤯
Is it really and F1 engine now, though? Is it?
But will it porpoise?
Gotta love the A Class indicator stalks in a 2.5m car.
i got this on forza it’s alright ig
Aston Martin Valkyrie is still a much more excting proposition. Screaming V12, the crazy F1/LMP esque bodywork.
Wasn't the whole point of this car that it would be lightweight and so have 1BHP per KG - hence its name? Big fail if so
Why doesn't chris harris drive those You have 1 good reviewer who'd actually intrigue you and you never let him drive the track specials
Why give a "dry" weight? You can't drive the ICE with no fluids in it, well not for very long anyway.
I was hoping to hear it...
$camdemic
Didn’t the maclaren senna already do this for less than half the price
122hp to just spool up a turbo?
Wrong 1063 is alot of HP,
I'd rather get the Rimac Nevera.  Good luck maintaining this car. Not that anyone is ever going to drive these on public roads anyways.
I hope it doesn't porpoise..
Already looks dated
I'll stick to my current ride which is another Top gear favourite. #hilux
"Its both utterly useless and completly brilliant in equal meassure and for that reason i love it"
Its performance for a "hypercar" is outdated the second its sold in a world of 2000+ BHP real Hypercars.
Helmet !!! von gerbals !!!!! he looks a buddle of laughs that one !!!!! does he smile at all  or is he miserable all the time
As an enthusiast I can honestly say they took a little too long to get to this point. But they're all sold anyway 🤷‍♂️
My dream car.
*MAYBE THEY SHOULD OF LET HAMILTON USE IT IN THIS YEARS F1*  Anything is better than his current car!
Most awkward interview ever 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
13:36 Sebastian Vettel in a merc
This is not a hyper car it is rather a hype-r car I can’t remember how long we were hyping for this…
maaaan i really want this car to be in gt7 but guess it would not be...
You telling me they drove thru portugal???? Why didnt they tell me
I'm not much of a car guy, but I thought it would have more of a one-to-one power to weight ratio i.e. 1200hp to 1200 kgs
I'll choose the Aston Martin Valkyrie over this anyday.
Imagine this car reminds you when to change to winter tyres: „Ok we’re going intermediate. Box Box Box! Box Box Box!“
It's a W13
looks like alot of things can break to me
FIRST MERCEDEDES that looks good !!!!! wow
This vs the SF90 will be interesting
Mega, bring on the ring👍🇬🇧
imagine the brabus version.
I'm thinking about either getting this, or the Valkyrie Spider
All the years of waiting for just 1000hp and 2.9 seconds 0-62?. To put things in perspective, the Veyron had the same horsepower over a decade ago.
How many cup holders?
Utterly irrelevant and soooo boring. It doesn’t even look that good. Give me a Lotus Emira any day. I’ll keep the change for the next Civic Type R and a new flat, too.
This Ve-hiiicle.
This or a Valkarie?
Looks dated to me now
Music should be louder next time. I nearly heard the engine..
Glad to see projects like this come to fruition, my favourite type of cars. Can’t wait to see what it can really do.
I can't believe they actually did it with the 1.6l V6 turbo hybrid.  They are aware that these are the most hated powertrains in the history of Formula 1, right?  There's a reason why the Valkyrie and T50 both use high-revving, naturally aspirated V12s. 🙄  I'm sorry, Mercedes, but the Ferrari F50 will forever remain the most desirable car with an F1 powertrain (as is reflected in its present value).
Recency bias, Jack... Renault installed their RS3C 3.5L V10 from the Williams FW14 into an Espace minivan
This car looks dated compared to what's come out since it's been in development
Laughing in Koenigsegg
Even though this is one of the most expensive new cars out.....it will surely be one of the most expensive cars EVER in the future!
I like the fact they r talking to the project lead and not some press guy.
Well is it possible to use the „not legal“ track mode on the roads?
that’s a special special car. i really hope i see one out on the open road at some point in my life. absolutely gorgeous thing. straight in my top 10
So wait… the electric motors put out around 500-600 hp. So the “Formula 1” engine only puts out another 500?. Did they pull this engine from a 70s F1 car?
Best car and best design  i like it
It’s nice and all but I’ll stick with my 2017 Fiesta 🥲
Incredible feat of engineering 🔥
Not even launched, already outdated. Shame.
well that looks nothing like a merc, crap!! can't care less about performance, the design it's crap, crap again
"From Abu Dhabi to Dubai" That just says it all doesnt it
mc12 body work
So the Aston Martin Valkyrie weighs substantially less, makes more power, and sounds far better.  I know which one I’d choose, although most owners are probably getting both.
I will not believe anything until I see that car being driven, in real time, no camera edits, all we've seen is it sitting still, and prototypes on the Nürburgring, we need to see this thing being driven in public, otherwise all this talk may be fake, lies were told about cars like this in the past and I don't want this to be the same, I really like this car and I need to see hard evidence of it doing what everyone says it can do, this car has the McLaren Senna to Rival it, a tall order, this car needs to do things on my list, preform turning G's of 6, 0-60 2.5 seconds, downforce that adapts to the road and turning circles, be able to match an F1 cars track time, and of course, ive seen this car in Horizon 5 with stats not listed by Mercedes, Horizon list the car with 877hp and weighs 3737 lb, makes me wonder whos telling the truth, we need to see if this car on what it boasts to be, we need to Critic this car because it has a high expectation to satisfy, especially since the cars already been sold out pre order wise
WOW   ! ! ! ! ! !  ! AWESOME AMAZING FANTASTIC MAGICAL SUPERB TOP TOP TOP   ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
WOW it looks amazing... I really wished that they entered this car into WEC into LMH
Feel like I'm the only person in the world that is disappointed with what this car turned out to be
A bit late now that redbull and ferrari are dominating
It is ugly
Dream car for any F1 fan
1700 kg..... Colin Chapman would be laughing
Errr... Ferrari already put an F1 engine in a road car... with the F50 back in the day. It has a modified version of the V12 F1 engine from the Ferrari 641 that Alain Prost drove in 1990. And if anyone says "yeah but that was modified", then yes, and that's the same here. This isn't literally the same as an F1 engine. More marketing nonsense for the idiotically super-wealthy. 2.4 million pounds? Ridiculous. Disgusting. Vulgar. Insane. Literally insane in my eyes.
1,7to? You're kidding. Back to start pls
AMG ONE VS T50
Miss the V12 V10 V8 F1 sound
I literally want to give him a hug everytime he says "vehicle" 😅
9:49 - Rotation. The wheels are on backwards.
Has to be the most hideous hyper car ever made.
Loved how he corrected him on the weight haha
Looks a lot like a 917.
i forgot how to pronounce vehicle after watching this
This car has had 10 different liveries since it was unveiled lol
And now we finally wanna see it being driven the way it was intended to
Wee hee kle
It's a lot heavier than I thought it would be
WoW. Nareszcie, endlich!
As has already been said, the F1 drivers are always complaining that the safety car is too slow… I think this may solve the problem 🏁🏁
https://youtu.be/YQRHnrFRW-0
All these hyper cars look the same. I dont care about what "contour" you see here or there, they all generally look the same. Im sure its mostly for aero, but still, YAWN.
I'm so pump right now
Must have been tempting to quietly give up and pretend they didn't want to do it, so good for them for getting it made.
Why didn't you ask the project leader how does the back of a RedBull look like?
This car is going be born already old.
it's just a fxx'k with 6 cylindres
Finally
BMW did a f1 engine car a 18 years ago  😹
ooo
I took this car first a test drive in forza horizon 5 lol 😆 😅
Looks terrible compared to the Aston Valkyrie. Interested to see how the performance compares.
Koenigsegg is laughing at this
AMG one vs aston Martin Valkyrie vs Ferrari sf90 stradale     drag race now!! It would be legendary battle like la Ferrari, p1 and 918
Now make it the f1 safety car!
It’s too late. Been outgunned before it’s been driven.
The 0-200 time is not that impressive, it means it's slower than SF90 and 765LT if it's exactly 7s as those done lower than that in reality  Also alot heavier than I expected thats Evija level of weight, but Thank You Mercedes for doing such a car, no matter the figures it's special!!!!!
Finally finished!!! 😍😍😍😍😍🙏
It's the first look this month... i think everyone has seen this car by now. Quite sure even mercedes' engineers have had enough of it
At least it seems to be faster than Hamilton's w13 😂
Can we still call it funny F1 car?
It arrived too late
Beautiful, makes me want more. Would love a modern take on the CLK GTR
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos.. 🟥

The Forza Horizon 5 Cover Car 🖼
Currently cross-shopping between this car and a 2006 Volvo V70. Very useful to get an in-depth look so I can make my decision a little better.
Wow
I was so hyped for this car. Really shows what Mercedes’ is capable of
