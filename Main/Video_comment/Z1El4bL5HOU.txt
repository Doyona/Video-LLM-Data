A long-standing viewer offered me and my "canal wife" (aka good friend) Lorna the use of his boat on the upper River Thames for a few days - thanks Ed! - which we were delighted to accept. This is the first of two videos of that trip. #AD Visit https://www.holzkern.com/en_world/cruisingthecut and use code CRUISING15  Start location: https://goo.gl/maps/ryzdckxRZiXcrg4K8 End location: https://goo.gl/maps/Mep8GUqViY2GMzMw7  Prior "Scholar Gypsy" videos:- Regent's Canal https://youtu.be/Y7jTEndUiQ0 Thames Barrier https://youtu.be/UeH5ZkA_emU Central London https://youtu.be/p0R7er1kmYM Ely to Cambridge https://youtu.be/e2iEAH5qJSQ Cambridge Backs https://youtu.be/eeyM94L1tb8
Wow, how beautiful are the brick high arch bridges passing through them and the glorious old brick houses overlooking the river. Thanks for sharing your journey with us. Bill A, USA Waco, Texas
15min  in is cleve lock not goring lock
Would you call the Thames England's Mississippi, or is that reaching too far for comparison?
Superior long boat design. Engine in rear with front steering away from noisy engine. Closed navigation and sky roof. No old Grandpa 1865 interior either!
Does your "house" wife believe Lorna has her own room?
Oh come now... Those geese deserve an 8 out of 10 at best. They mucked up the formation completely. Nobody hold position.
Ok, so if the boats you are renting are higher boats, are the ones you own lower boats then, mate? (SCNR! I know it's HIRE, not higher!) :D ^^
you should say 'my wife''' not THE wife
Awesome video. I have watched a few of your videos before, but this one got me to subscribe. Well done!
Bad advertising
You're a Jolly good kind of chappie. Thank you for this rather interesting video...I shall search out the next.
Got to say after watching a  hundred plus assorted videos - I think Id prefer cruising on rivers rather than canals...IF I ever did go in a boat
wait, the lock keeper was rude? well thats not nice of him or her. I wonder if he was having a bad day, still no reason to be rude.
Can't help but think of the Goon Show at this point....... " IN THE CANAAAALLL HAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!"
😂😂 pushing bodies over.
5:34 I swear it is TOAD HALL. I did not know it was real, but it apparently is!
What a beautiful scenery. I, as a German did most of our rivers and alkes here. But this is too spectacular. I hope I can make it to the UK and drive around the river Themes.
Wow!!!!, I really like the setup on that narrowboat "pipedream" how its steering is up front......like a floating R.V
Lovely journey… aside from the inevitable Rain.
You should copyright the windshield wiper tune
Bildifull ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I think that I have found the best site on youtube! Thank you so much
Beautiful video! Thank you. Sorry about that first lockie. Wonder what his deal was?
Just as i was thinking "Thats a very responsive boat" She said, its rather responsive. With the heavy steerage, off the top of my head and my experience operating a plethora of Power Boats, including 48' World capable cruisers, im going to guess, its got a teleflex style single cable steering system, and as quickly as it turns, im also guessing an outdrive unit, i know yall have them, ive seen regular non canal Boats, although they wete technically on Canals, i think ive heard David also call.thrm Cruisers, but i could be mistaken. The outdrive is like a lower unit 9f an outboard, it needs no rudder because youre turning the propeller. Theyre an absolute dream to dock and maneuver
Hi David, it’s nice to get back to your vlogs. I think it’s been about 4 years 😮.  I’ll try not too be gone so long this time. I know you have wounded where I have been 😅.  Thanks so much for these wonderful views of jolly old England. 🤠
Nostalgia! Let me be!! Throughout my childhood I was obsessed with canal boating holiday brochures!! And what a bonus! Every boat came with an attractive blond , a dog and a gurning middle-aged couple using their hire boat to stalk the blond and the pooch.
Brings back memories of a lads boating holiday from Caversham onboard the Maid Olivia, sometime in the early 90's. How that thing survived is beyond me.
Did 'Cruising the cut' ever pass (my beloved) Iffley Lock near Oxford, and if so, in which "'episode"?
🖐
A clump of geese you mean a Gaggle 😅😂😅 just saying
What a loverly outing you both are having , reminds me when the wife  and i had 2 weeks on the broads with a craft very simular to yours, a most enjoyable event.
I enjoy your videos so much,  I always feel sad when it ends,  haha!   So then I go to one of your playlists☺️
Very neat boat.  I've always wonder why boats are steered from the rear.
Lorna seems like she'd be a lot of fun to hang out with. she knows how to laugh
I loved the remark 'pushing bodies overboard '!
As an American, it blows my mind that boaters don't always wave to each other.
Us Americans would get tired resl quick of all that sloww put putting around. Wed bw wanting to open it up get it on plane & birn the carbon build up on the exhaust valves😂😂😂
God i wish we had a canal system like this here in Savannah GA. And we have canals crisscrossing 3 counties around us. Along with some rivers that helps connect the even more. Ive been talking about they should put walking yrails & the likes on the canals. You would be able to go all over Chatham County by the canal paths. I believe it would bring in business and promote a healthier lifestyle. If you add canal boats as well the it would be even more business. But the local would probably just commit a lot of crime on them & just throw trash everywhere. Not caring to take care of any of it. Right along with vandalizing ewater, pump ot & trash points. You they have no hime training.
Good one ..... Very entertaining...... & 'Your Wifes 😂 ' last comment - Poison 😂
Love following along your voyages. Makes one long for the canals. I hope a tourism board invites you for drinks every once in a while.
3.30 Why would a lock keeper make boaters feel unwelcome?? I think it highly unlikely that you two gave him any grief. It's awful when people behave like that. Do they actually enjoy bringing people down? They should not be in a job that involves interaction with the general public. Excellent video, thanks. Look forward to the next one. Do they make narrow versions of this that would be suitable for the canal network or are there disadvantages to using boats such as this rather than a traditional narrowboat?
People are so ignorant. Why do you say “THE WIFE” that is such a rotten thing to say when referring to your wife. Shame on you, you should know better.
Thanks for another wonderful episode of Cruising. I'm thoroughly enjoying seeing the rivers and canals and meeting your friends.
I'm curious about the watch company sponsor. I didn't see the name anywhere.
PS.  love Cruising the Cut
What a nice trip. Thanks for sharing.
⛴ ⛴ ⛴⛴⛴ ⛴ ⛴ ⛴⛴⛴
I thought the collective noun for geese was 'a gaggle'? Great video as always, thanks to both of you.
I live in Michigan (US) it was a little surprising to me how similar the landscape is to where i live.  Obviously the boats, bridge's, and home architecture is quite different. But the foliage,the waters, even the locks are similar to ones in northern Michigan.   Enjoyed the video, ill be sure to look for others. Be safe,live well.
that is a gaggle or wedge of geese.
oh wow??!?! are u a professional narrator?
Always loved a story by Peter Ustinov. When asked during the war why he would like to join a Tank Regiment, he replied 'Well, I would prefer to to go into battle sitting down'. 😂😂
Easiest way to get me to turn off - mid vid adverts.
why don't the other  oncoming boaters wave? We always wave to the other boaters in the US.
David,  I will say that I'm as loathe as most for these mid-vid adverts... but! Hearing one quoted in your nice voice... well, it's alright with me.  Paul in Oregon, USA
i just love Nora ;)
15:55 - The town of "Goring" and the name of that boat. Subliminal messages of Wilde's An Ideal Husband!
Thames, Severn , Dart, and if you want the best inland boating adventure there is, (in my opinion), The Caledonian Canal - all of it! I have a friend who's lived aboard his 55 foot cruiser, (a Linnsen A/c Variotop) on The Caledonian Canal for 10 years and it never gets boring or tiresome. I've sailed it a number of times and it's always a new experience.
Looks like Ed's boat.
all i can say is fair winds and following seas lol x
🤛👍🙏🦅⛵️🇺🇸😎
If living on a dirty boat in the most polluted canals in the world is "living the dream", you must have really low standards in life.
MMMM, boat burgers! Yummy.
19:09 Windscreen wiper: "Havin' a good time?  Havin' a good time?"
Oh dear what can i say , found myself scanning your channel to find a fountain of glorious content and as i am a land lover you convert me sir well done
Even at high Res I couldn't read the name of the boat that British viewers would appreciate
I see the use of an arrow on a map there David. What happened to your drawings?
The is peak Alan Partridge.
Please don't feed waterfowl crackers or bread. Oats, peas or sweet corn are fine.
Used to live in Abingdon, swam in the Thames often.
Cygnets not chicks! 😊
My old neck of the woods Pangbourne to reading, il return oneday but in a boat 👍👌👍👌
Spending a relaxing Sunday watching Marvel's secret invasion, what would make it perfect would be on a Narriwboat with a Nice Cuppa, eating eggs on toast. 😋
Why can't one anchor of the bank with fore and aft moorings?
Baby swans are signets.
just curious , but what GAA jersey is Lorna wearing ?
I would still love to do this once before I check out for good.  This type boat is more to my liking but I did love the narrow boat you had
David and Lorna, I am enjoying trip on the Tyames" hope I spelled it right" I am American. I will be looking for part 2  !  Lorna handles the boat like a pro. Thanks for the video.
I love the style of your narration. Wonderful.
thanks for sharing, I used to go to college in Pangbourne.. great place, should have visited the swan pub on the thames, great sunday roasts
NO my man....on a trip like this you take  a tasty young girl...just to pass the time!!!
Takes me back to a holiday we had in the mid 70s on a similar but slightly larger boat on the Thames. Ours didn’t have a sliding canopy. Hoeseasons I think we hired from.Picked it up in Reading.
can you do a feature on the off grid living of the man who lives on the huge old wooden half sunken boat on the Thames opposite the Tesco in Reading near where the canal joins the river . be good to cover things like that on the waterways
I'm probably being greedy, but could you show a few more seconds of the older odd looking boats like that black one with the white graffics on the front and window shutters. I like your humor as you narrate and want to see more so I subscribed.😊
As much as I loved all the canal videos, I think this may be a new favorite. There were some idyllic places along the river that make me want to hop on a plane, fly to England and rent a boat for my own trip downriver. I really like the look of this boat and it seems perfect. Now on to check out Lorna's video.
I cringed when at the first moment of using someone else's boat (0:51) she wacked the motor into full forward. If it was mine, at that exact moment I would want it back.
And if you subscribe David will buy us all a posh watch 😂
Swans are utter bastards that never agree to anything 13:51 I always find pigeons and horses far easier to do business with. They only need to start walking around the place and they are eagerly nodding their heads in agreement with every plan and scheme you can mention.
11:12 I'm certain that is a location for a murder on Midsommer Murders.
Reading to Abingdon - wow !
I'm in USA but remember Reading well I was born in Newbury. I moved here in 81 was 11. Have fun, be safe.
I haven’t been to your channel for a while and you now have a wife
"...pushing bodies overboard." 😂 Thanks for this video!
At 15.30 that is Cleeve Lock.  Goring is the next one, about three-quarters of a mile further downstream
Nice looking lines on that boat!  Great video as always.  :)    Happy Thanksgiving from the USA.
What a nice layout, the double ensuite set up is terrific
Great video on my part of the river ❤
I sweat this man needs to do some work with audio books as on of there readers. He turns the simplest of acts into pure ear candy
Living the dream in perpetual rain....
I rather do like the inside forward steering.
My sister and brother in law on their cruse stopped in sonning, to go home for a shower
i finally realized british people like canal boats so much because it gives them plenty of time to queue
She seems like a fun comfortable  person to be around.  The guy is easy to listen to even in the pitch
respect for surving the wild west of tescos!
Interesting that you should mention Three Men In a Boat.  I once read it aloud to my wife.  (Without the appropriate accent, I'm afraid.)  Much to my surprise, she enjoyed it immensely.  So much so that about 8 to 10 years later she asked me to read it again.  And thanks to your beautiful videotaping, we can now visualize it better the next time we read it.  I can definitely see the attraction that this stretch of the river offers to boaters.  Makes me wish I could still travel.
Really good video David you need to get another boat even if it’s a weekend boat
These locks remind me of the locks on the Trent-Severn here in Ontario. A great video.
Would like to see the interior
Add a rear view “ backup style “ camera like new cars have.
Are these swimming canals?
Sitting in a comfortable seat, out of the wind or cold weather.
With a bow thruster
I like this layout so much more than trad designs
Thanks for the cruise on the river or canal really enjoyed it ,  love seeing those white swans!!!!     💞👍.         Australia 🦘
A lovely stretch of the river. I've sailed it many times.
😀😄
Very good
This was so funny I loved it!
A serene adventure narrated with a lot of creativity and good humor... Nothing better than sailing alongside good company... thank you for your generosity in letting us accompany you... seen from Brazil
love you man
What type of boat is this
Beautiful  time on the water. BIG SIGH.......    PS, Got me with "push a body out" had me laughing and woke my wife up as I'm watching this at 2am in the morning.
That was a good one.
Thank you. I rather liked that and subscribed. All the best from Sydney Australia 🇦🇺
Great video and of course very entertaining 👍
Always enjoy your "cruises" on the cut ... not something we do around here!  What fun!!  Thanks for sharing!  [Greetings from Tucson]
Life is about freedom and happiness! Money is just a secondary
Enjoying your travels❤
David I have watched your videos since covid kept us all at home they are brilliant your lovely English accent ❤️
Human nature, maybe, but now I'm fixated on what sort of problems you had with that first lock keeper! Great trip though, looks like lots of fun. I have a small cabin motor boat which I use on the Hudson river sometimes... and you've inspired me to at least do the overnight I've been hoping to squeeze in there before the end of the year...
feeding swans cheddars...please don't tell the rspb!
I'd recommend maybe having your lady take a boaters educational course might be a good idea for you to. Lovely video although I really wish more people used nautical terms whilst on a boat. Like helm instead of drivers seat. Or starboard instead of right. It has its place and it's part of the experience. I myself have been boating from 17 foot bass boats that my dad had when I was young. To helping him build river race boats and then nowadays owning a sailboat jet ski speed boat and houseboat. I take a refresher course every year just to learn more and especially with knots and sailing. I've made trips from Hawaii to different island chains as well as sailed all around florida and the Caribbean and up the eastern coast of america. Cant wait till my two boys ages 3 and 1 right now. Are old enough to take on long sailing trips with me and mom.
Super
Really enjoyed this video. My sadly now deceased partner and myself moored our 20 foot cruiser on Nags Head Island, Abingdon, for many years. Your video has brought back so many memories of the happy, carefree days out and short Holiday breaks my partner, my younger family members, 4 border collie dogs and myself enjoyed. From baking hot sunny days to thundery, soggy rainy days, nothing before or since those precious years of cruising the River Thames, both above and below Abingdon-on-thames, has ever brought me such peace, comfort, relaxation and feelings of both pure joy and contentment. Thank you for the chance to revive the memories of the very best days of my life.
Hi David. The boats are designed that way in order to pass under the bridges at Wroxham  and Potter Heigham. I highly recommend a trip on the Broads, not sure if you have been. There are some lovely spots to moor up. Also there are number of preserved wherries you could make a video about, similarly the Nancy Oldfield trust at Neatishead offers cruising and sailing experiences for disabled people, again could be something interesting to viewers.
Brilliant journey! Greetings from Cocoa Beach, Florida. BTW, we have a nice long river that goes from Orlando flowing north to Jacksonville. It goes through a half dozen quite large lakes and has scores of restaurants and state parks you can dock at.
Would it fit in canal lock .?
Everything is so gorgeous there. Your killing me here.
A rude volunteer seems counterproductive
This is the kinda boat i would want, steering wheel, front cockpit. Sliding roof. I'd just want more deck space up front
Thanks David and Lorna, I used to live round there, taken my boys up Wittenham clumps many times
What an interesting & funny, happy video - thanks! I really enjoy your & Lorna's vids and you have both long been my imaginary friends who cheer me when I'm low & lonely. David, I loved all your little jokes & puns etc in this one! Lorna is so competent & wonderfully natural & sweet. Well done both of you lovely people! Looking forward to lots more. Best wishes. xx
Last July I decided to visit London. Leave the Netherlands, drive from Blankenberge (B) to Ramsgate and then up to London. The weather was too bad and 1 day at Ramsgate became 5, so I had to go back again. I know, time schedule and boating does not work together. But I wanted to see the Thames and see how far I could come with my trawler yacht. Luckily I found this video and I get the views I was hoping for, although I think I will never be able to get here with a boat of 5.3m airdraft, will I?
It was very beautiful.  I also like to live and sail on small canals with boats like this. You are very lucky. Stay well.
I'd forgotten how reassuring it was to listen to the opening tones of your intro music...Great vlog!
Very nice to see you again, David and with an added bonus, Lorna!  Looks like it didn't take you two much time to sort the new kind of boat.  I must say sitting and steering really must win out over standing at the tiller in the rain.   I really like the look of the boat and the sliding canopy just made it for me.  I'd have one in a trice if I weren't living in Canada.... Thanks for another most pleasant bit of time on the water.  The Thames certainly is beautiful. Cheers to both of you from Ottawa, ON!
こういうのを見ると、イギリスはやはり文明国だと思う。
I don’t know Dave…this would have to land within the top 10 of all your presentations. I sat watching with my mouth gaping!
Subtle dig at ted heath..or maybe Robert Maxwell?
That sliding hatch has me captivated. It's the most Mini Van feature I've ever seen and I love it.
'pushing a body overboard' got me laughing out loud.  what a great tour of a boat - completely different to our north american  style of boats.  And Canal boating looks so interesting.  thank you for this informative video - The Green Boater
Those "le boat" bathtubs are also common in NL. I really think they are disgusting. And the skippers always seem to forget that those fenders look very awkward as well ;) (at least in NL it is a custom of (more experienced) skippers to always 'retract' the fenders while boating unless one comes up to a lock or mooring of course).
I do so enjoy your humorous commentary! Many thanks.
Was looking for a boat tour... Maybe in part 2.
Good video and good to see London boat girl again AKA Lorna, Cruisers always seem to take a lot of turns on the wheel before coming around a tiller seems to be more direct ?? all ready seen the second vlog so i watched this just to catch up as it were, Ok David see your next vlogs soon i expect You both stay safe   Ed 40 S of Vegas
Beautiful part of the river Thames. As you came through Goring you would have gone past George Michael's beautiful house.
Doesn't have the mystique of the narrow boat, but it looks quite a bit more comfortable.
Was in Tewkesbury today and went to look what boats were on the Avon there....there was one narrowboat there of a decent ish length.... I am guessing you would know how it got there David....just thought I would mention it.... Cheers for now.... God speed.....
I'd love a Dutch Barge, but I'm with you I like an 11ft barge, yes, please.
I'm pretty sure we hired one of this design on the Norfolk Broads about 50 years ago
Nice video 😊
Such a lovely boat 👍☺️
👍🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺😁😁😁
Got Wind in the willows vibes😍
I was stationed at RAF Benson, so it was really nice to hear it on your journey.  Looked a wonderful journey, already seen part 2 so just playing catch up.
Just ordered me a watch 😊
Why are some locks so well kept and others aren’t?
Pretty sure mooring on a river is fair game unless it's someone's back garden , you can park anywhere for the night
I feel the need to speak up for the Thames Lockies. I have just got back from taking my NB from Duke's Cut to Henley and back. Without exception every Lock Keeper was friendly,  helpful and efficient at managing the traffic.
I started this channel at the beginning and must admit I have not checked in for some time. I always thought it would be a popular channel. It’s fun as a boater in America to see this entirely different type of nautical life!!  Cheers!!
Thank you both.  So lovely.
keep a bottle of Rain-X onboard, Just say no to noisy wiper motors....
Great video. Also did this stretch and agree the locals need to sort out their visitor mooring situation. Too much private mooring and far too many neglected vessels.
Captain David ⛵ it's good to see you back on the high seas.  Relatively speaking of course 😊. I hope you and your sailing Wife enjoyed the trip. Stay safe and God Bless 👍🏾
Lorna gets everywhere, on Jen on the move channel as well as her own. This cracked me up.. "What are we having Lorna?"...."Food poisoning". And as for that whinging windscreen wiper 🤣. Well done both of you 👍🏻
When you upload next part?
Nice boat and yet another lovely narrative, thanks.  Is there also narrowboats with a steering point up front and indoors? Just curious. Wishing you all the best! Greetings from Finland
Thanks for the peak at the Upper Thames which I have never seen. I'd always pictured it as an old industrial area with abandoned factories. I have no idea why. lol
Are you considering doing a vlog on Morning Star with Paul and Anthony on their electric narrowboat? That would be soooo cool.
When does episode 2 come out please?
I  am  BERNARD    living   near   PARIS....  you   see  the  man  Who  usually  ...used   to  say   (you  are   my  english  teacher)..... If  you  have  one  day...the   désir  to  travel   go   to  BUENOS  AIRES....and   go  to  the   river      ( TIGRE)... to  use   boat   like   that..........expérience     that   you  should   keep      all your  life
nice! prettier than the canals i think
How did you get on with the Tides or is that part of the Thames not tidal?
You kept that quiet congratulations 🎉
When you first start your journey, Lorna says oh Dixie Belle that is a nice name,  well our Bounty 30 was called Dixie Belle , we sold her and I think she went down to Sussex from The Broads.
I’ve missed this channel
Private moorings on public way. Outrageous some people too much money need a slap 🤑💸😜
I took Lazy Days up there many years ago and found a great mooring spot near Reading Bridge next to a pub owned by the Pleasure boat company, spent a couple of evenings chatting with the company skippers. They gave me tips on free moorings down river, just up river is Maple Durham where The Eagle Has Landed was filmed one hot summer, we camped in huge camper vans next to the film set village. Five of us looking after the WWII trucks and jeeps. If I remember right there's another grumpy lock keeper further downstream, but our excuse of an overheated engine gave us enough time to cook and eat breakfast just short of the lock landing. He likes two spoons of sugar in his coffee.!!!!!!
So there's just one thing to say - 'Plock!' - I guess
My word... is this David's first cliff hanger two part episode??
Ah, my old stomping grounds as a rowdy youth and young man. Have never seen them from the Thames, though, so that was a nice treat.  Lovely episode.
Thanks
“Chicks”? Cygnets surely!
I love the design of you loaner boat... especially the slider roof 😊
Well how about that. Been there and done that. My wife and small son James(12) had one just like yours. It was from Abingdon too. Hiring from Salter Yard as it was called. We called Goring boaring he he.
Absolutely loved this one David. t was so good to see you and Lorna back on the Thames braving the high seas . That is a most unusual boat with such a unique design, I can see this as a fun vessel to navigate the larger rivers, quite comfortable and roomy. I look forward to to part two and thanks so much for all the hard work which goes into making these.
That scenery is so spectacular!  Those properties!   It reminds me so much of the canal that runs through Hoboken New Jersey!
Goring and Streatly? Sounds like Three Men in a Boat :)
Beautiful watches
I'm watching S2E7 right now, you went through 10 locks, over 2 miles of canal. It makes me ask; why not use an 18v cordless impact? Or do the rules and regulations not permit them? I apologize if this is a common question, I've yet to finish every episode(nearly there though).
any port in a storm
Such beautiful homes.... Glad you had a fun trip!! ... Nice to see you back on the water...
Whats a geese? All I saw was Cobra Chickens...
Rotfl.."musical windscreen wiper"...hysterical
enjoyed this video , i liked the small cottage at the start .                 cheers
"the Wife".......doesnt she have a name. how rude.
I love that boat! And I'm not even a boater! Can I use it on Lake Erie? Thanks for the great video, David. Beautiful filming of a beautiful location.
Great vid.. I was on one of those  BROADS BOATS  decades ago.. I hated the steering wheel. You were always turning the damn thing to compensate for drift.  and if you turned it one way you were forever trying to straighten up only for you to go in the opposite direction.    DRY THOUGH 😀
Honestly that was the best advert seguey I've ever seen!😄
Beautiful waterways and beautiful scenery mate.  Cheers.
verry nice. thank you.
Is this  morphine for permanent moorers  who never leave the marina
Lovely to see both of you on the water again! The pipedream indeed! Thanks from Denver, CO, USA! Looking out for part II!
If you cannot find a mooring, can you just toss out an anchor on the Thames?  First time for everythinhg...
Beautiful watches...wish I knew what a chronometer was...might buy one  .. ;-)
Wittenham clumps. Or, Mother Dunch's Buttocks...
At 21:00, looking for resurrected dodos - is that a Jasper Fforde reference?  If not, what, please?
Great video. Did you know George Michael lived in  Goring and you  can see his house from the Thames.
I want a place to push bodies overboard.
You might video chronicle the Thames from Kemble to the Thames Estuary , a historical endeavor , a marvelous undertaking resulting in a significant achievement
It sounds like you know the town where I grew up, David. It includes Goring-by-Sea. I always liked that side of town, it had lots of open space, greenery, and the best of the town's beaches.  I love the willow trees. I've loved willow trees ever since there was one on the way to school in Tarring village. At times it was trimmed, but at other times its branches hung all the way down, forming tiny circular rooms. :) Sadly, like so many of the the roadside trees in town, it got chopped down years ago. The roots were damaging the foundations of peoples' houses. Only the largest town roads allow for peaceful coexistance between houses and trees, and one of the delights of Goring-by-Sea is how many such roads it has.  If that were my boat, I'd have a real struggle deciding whether or not to fix the windscreen wiper. ;)
Only 6 mins. in and very serene..therapy for last few days hectic schedule.... you may have heard Vermont has had some water of it's own this month...kayacking down Main Street in Montpelier...
I was genuinely mid bite of a cheese and tomato sandwich when you dropped the body overboard line.
Well this is different than narrow boats but enjoyable from a different perspective. Thanks
Come on mate! As a Brit in the States I have to say you’re not doing much for the British food reputation. Condiments man, mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, bit of onion, slice of cheese, well that’s assuming you can find the abomination that is “American cheese.”
G,day David from Sydney Australia. Nicely presented as always and with a sponsor. They look excellent quality. That's funny, you still need to use the locks even if not in a narrowboat?😜☘️
Hi (Captain) Lorna and (Bosun) David,  another great video..    And this time in an unusual, but fantastic looking boat..   Could you give me some details about Ed's boat, please.??   Cheers, Padraic
Love it, just love it. Thank you and can’t wait for more ‘food poisoning’ episodes!
9:10 was very funny
Loved the video, and amazed at how lovely the Thames is further upriver. This is the first chance to view  it I've had, so looking forward to the next episode. Looking at the beautiful buildings on the the riverside, my mind wanders to wonder if any of the owners of these gorgeous properties ever experienced or could possibly understand what living in a back to back, 2up 2down terrace house in a factory town was or is like? Scenes like these always seem to remind me of Animal farm.
Is Kate still lock keeper at Benson?, a credit to her craft
Awesome David and Lorna... love seing you guys on an adventure...aloha from Volcano Hawaii
food poisoning....lol
I rather like the look and layout of that boat. Steering from the front with an indoor cabin has to be nice!
Do not ask for whom the swan tolls for it tolls for food great upload as ever wait for the next I will.
The pipe dream
I'm from Memphis, TN and love your videos. Everytime I am utterly astounded at how beautiful England is. Can't wait for part two! Cheers~
Perhaps if the lockie didn't make you feel welcome showing him on YouTube may have given him food for thought about his attitude!
“There’s nothing––absolutely nothing––half so much worth doing as messing about in boats.” ― Kenneth Grahame, The Wind In The Willows 😊
That boat has been on the K&A for the last couple of months, so they must've turned off the Thames at Reading
15:21 The name of the barge seems to be Issmumatar. I have a feeling, there is a wordplay on Illuvatar, which, as a non native English speaker, I'm just not getting. Can someone please help me out?
I grew up in this area and used to go fishing and swimming with my mates in the Thames. Now I live not far from the Rhein, dreadfull.
another thoroughly enjoyable video thank you
I was waiting for "Left hand down a bit number1" (An old radio show for you younger ones).
Do they make a narrow version of these type of boats and is the draft suitable for canals?
A "floating plastic holiday box" Lol
So glad to see you at the helm and on the river again David ( & Lorna too!) Cheers from Nova Scotia :)
Thank you David, you brought me good memories from my time in berkshire. Greetings from Argentina!
Your vlogs are always interesting and enjoyable.  Thank you,  Cheers.
I would happily live in one of the boat houses! gorgeous! Less house work ahaha
the signs made me laugh out load hahaha
Actually, I think those geese scored 14 out of 14... 😂 Great trip, even with the rain. Good people make everything better.
David, thank you for another compelling video. I had no idea that part of the Thames could be so picturesque. As for the criticism by some of your sponsored ad, I simply don't understand it. You offer a wonderful brand of informative entertainment and you have to keep yourself solvent. Carry on I say.
What a lovely trip, David! So nice to see Lorna. 😎😎😎 Can’t wait for Part 2! 🥰🥰🥰❤️
aaah wifey hahaha.. Yes I follow Lorna haha
💜💙💚
Love the info on these watches/jewelry etc! Thank you !! Great video too! This little boat is great!
Fun times with the Wife🤣…. Can’t wait for the next part.. but I guess I’ll have to🩵💦
How much more POWERFUL is this boat than your old narrowboat?  Can you easily do the Thames tidal  bit with it?  Were you whipping passed the narrowboats? What was the feeling of "raw power" like? 😅😉
Lovely, brought back some memories of taking kids canoeing on the Culham cut and the Thames when I worked for PGL a very long time ago!
My hubby and I moored behind ‘Ant on Dec’ at Clifton Locks on 1st August and left early the next morning, I think we just missed you David. 😮
you cant have burgers without butter on the buns what the hell you thinking :)
I love that you and Lorna are so close you use 'wife' to refer to her. EVERYONE needs friends THAT close. Love to see you two together having adventures!
Mooring on the Thames is a total nightmare, you pay £1000 plus for a River Thames licence from the Environment Agency that requires boat safety certificates and proof of insurance and can’t moor due to the endless amount on boats squatting on moorings with non of the above.
As a long time viewer you previously said you wouldn't  sell out. So I was disappointed  when you started promoting boat companies,  but watches?  Watches, really? Hugely disappointed. Sorry
Makes me want to buy a squeeze-box & learn the Trumpet Hornpipe! ('Pugwash' theme : )
This has been one of my favorites, thank you, i love it!
Thanks David, loved it to learn more about this end of the Thames. And the narration was very entertaining as ever. Looking forward to the next installment
Brilliant as usual, I used to watch your canal adventures every Sunday morning with a bowl of cereal, my guilty pleasure, keep the videos going
Wonderful video very relaxing. I quite enjoyed the rain. It was peaceful.
Started off crap, so didn't bother carrying on.  Dissapointed, so good previously.
Is the space on the back for pushing ‘bodys’ or ‘Bobbys’?  Please say ‘Bobby’s’…there are a few guys named Bobby I would like to send your way! 😂😂
"What we having Lorna?" He asked... "Food poisoning" she said...! Love it!🤣 That made me laugh out loud. Great vid and a good trip, I enjoyed watching it - just like old times David. You and Lorna make a great team, love the humour.
so cool seeing many different styles and views of canal / river life  oh the rain, dispelled my memory of endless summers in UK
This was fantastic !!!  The wind shield wiper was hilarious.
ahah ! the swans are collecting fees
Interesting, I live off of Pangborn blvd, down the road from Pangborn elementary school, further down the road from Pangborn park here in MD, USA!
Ahh; Benson.  My hometown [village].  I particularly enjoyed this episode.  If/as/when you get back to Benson David, I can highly recommend the Cafe overlooking the river.  A cracking spot for a cup of tea and a cheese sandwich! Or a G&T!
Well that was a good laugh, enjoyed it, makes me want to go boating
I did this trip in 2017 and this got me into your channel. Abingdon is a beautiful town and the Thames a great way to see this part of the world.
Enjoyed this video- please do more boating vids! Curious as to what the first lockee said that made you and Lorna feel unwelcome?
14:00 - 'Scuse me you two, there are mooring fees here, you know! And my children are very hungry indeed...'
Enjoyable video as always. Thank you for posting.
A great video, those Broads cruisers are only made for holidays though. They're not very well fitted out galley wise, no washing machine etc. In the past I've crused that part of the Thames mayn times. Also the bit above Abingdon which in my opinion is a much nicer section.
The scene on 3.45 is really funny, a swan who was not aware of your boat. David it might be boring to praise you again for nice scenery and both cynic as well as hilaric naration but your video's really give me a good time ! Actualy this rather odd boat, is pretty welll equiped for a hollyday, and i also appreciated the movable roof enabling to steer both inside and outside. Ok not a live on board boat, but still a comfy traveler.
How did the pushing bodies out the stern, work?
Locks on the Thames? Who'd of thunk it!?
Being from the state of Massachusetts in the USA, we also have an Abington and a Reading.  I clicked on the link wondering how in the heck someone was going to boat between these two landlocked towns. Oops.  So many of our towns, cities and counties bear the names of the land our founders had left behind.
Disappointing that you've succumbed to having sponsors/advertising. The attraction of your earlier vlogs was that they were interesting and informative and if you liked an item or product that you had bought to use on your boat you said so. Similarly, if there were faults or even if it was rubbish, you said so. No matter how much you may protest that it is not the case, I find it hard to believe that if a company is "sponsoring" your video, you would appear on camera to tell your 237k subscribers that it was shite. Sorry David, I'm off.
I followed the link for the watches Will that help? I'm not buying a wooden or stone watch  Even with the rain, it seemed like a nice cruise on the river
That wiper made that din 20odd Year ago whenit were in brinkcraft hire fleet
What is happening to this wonderful channel. I cant even avoid this advertising with a premium subscription!! 😭😭😭
what a beautiful boat and love the wide open river thames, Great Vvlog as always thanks
What a lovely trip you two had. Beautiful part of the country.
But where are the cheese sandwiches and martinis?
Quality video as usual. The jokes are awesome! LOL! Love the boat adventures.  Hello to Lorna!
always worthwhile thanks again.
Pushing bodies over board,love it.
In the past I have wondered and even tried a few drawings of ways to incorporate Norfolk Broads cruiser design ideas into a canal narrow boat. In terms of fitting things in (if going for forward controls) the beam seems to be about the biggest concern. I'd want electric propulsion with a backup generator, so that allows for flexibility in locating things. Just not sure whether narrow boat builders would be interested in doing something very different as a new design would mean many extra man hours. What is the beam of the boat you are on?
I used to keep my cruiser at Better Boating in Reading and then Fry's Island with the bowls club on it. My favourite run was to Benson. Good to see that stretch of the river again after a few years away. My boat is now quietly deteriorating (albeit on dry land) very close to North Kilworth marina where I believe you sold your narrowboat. I really must get round to sorting it out and getting it on the canal!
Kinda annoying to have to watch the commercials YouTube incorporates in the videos PLUS having product placement ads added as well by the content creator. Been seeing more and more of this. I guess the money YouTube pays isn't enough. Great video, as always.
People seem to be getting more and more miserable these days!
Musical windscreen wiper made me laugh
So enjoyable even in the rain. Delightful cruise. Beautiful boat. I can see you getting yourself another wee boat at some point. Your heart is still in the waters. Thank you great video
You get a thumbs up for the dead body comment 🤣🤣
Thoroughly enjoyed your informative and amusing version of this jaunt. Thanks David.
David, as enjoyable as it is to see all the sights on your canal/river travels is the differences in the bridges that you pass under. I wonder if the builders were just trying to put together something that is functional or were they trying to make an architectural statement?
An en suite each! What luxury!!  “or for pushing bodies overboard” caught me off guard! Thanks for the laughs David 😊
Your videos are the best, most wholesome videos on YouTube. Love them David and love your channel. Looking forward to part two.  Hope it drops soon 👍🏻
You missed out on Mapledurham, the mill of which featured on the cover of Black Sabbath's first album. The village featured heavily in the film 'The Eagle Has Landed'.
an interesting change = and an ensuite shower each!!
A delightful video. .Makes me want to emulate it.  I didn't mind the watch ads and had a look but they didn't seem to have one with numerals which I gnerally prefer
I do like those broads cruisers, cozy little things, one could easily live in one. Do you know how well they manage coastal putterin' about?
Very enjoyable vlog, it looked so relaxing I can't wait to see part 2. 😀
One of the most picturesque stretches of the Thames - though the 'musical' windscreen-wiper is enough to drive you, well...back onto the roads. Thank you for a delightful river trip.
My family used own that type of boat years ago it was called Mustang
I really enjoy your stories and off the cuff humour.😂
Great, now the Song of The Windscreen Wiper is stuck in my head... :D It was a nice video though, and interesting to see a converted lifeboat (at around 20:13 ) on the river.
Sorry just found link
Had a gent, Horatio Nelson, sitting beside me, whilst watching this vlog,  poor lad started crying as you set off, then when you "waxed lyrical about -the wind, weather and chronometers", he howled, then when you said about being inside whilst it rained, steering  "a  ship",  he went and made a cup of tea.  I  "steer my ship, via keyboard & computer mouse" and between you & the 2 likely lads (of SilverFox vlogs on the canals) - have see, via the camera lens parts of the UK, that no normal tourist would ever see - including your quota of swans. Look forward to the next video.
Brilliant video! I lived on my boat at Bray for 18 months and loved being able to head up to Oxford and out to sea.
Can not see link mentioned in video
Some lovely scenery thanks for the video David and Lorna. You mention compact double bed, if I recall correctly I had to sleep across at an angle when I was last on a narrow boat. How long roughly are the beds….6ftish? Presumably compact in this case as it’s narrower? Does the cruiser have two doubles? Or double and two singles?
You must do one of the most enjoyable videos on U tube 👍 ... Can't wait for episode 2 .
I smiled ear to ear throughout this video - loved it 😄❤️🏴‍☠️
Have you got a problem with Manuel labour it looks like it lol
Interesting and entertaining. When my parents had a boat on the Ouse we would occasionally see other craft with forward control and I’ve always wondered what it must be like to “drive” from that position. I think I would worry about what the boat’s stern was up to, what was your experience? Best wishes . . .
Resurrected Dodos in Reading? Is this a Thursday Next reference?
Burgers!!!  What no cheese sandwich?  Looks like you're being converted.
No matter how polite and friendly I am, and always do everything you’re supposed to while using the lock, the Thames lock keepers are very rude and unfriendly, a real shame and do put a downer on the day.   Also, don’t worry about the ADs, it’s a part of full time YouTuber.
The Thames is a private exclusive club all though being of water boats are not welcome. Every one who ventures into the Thames struggles for mooring space. It is clear and obvious that "they" don't want it turning into an extension of the K&A. Like you as time goes and light fades anxiety levels increase. We once found a desperate just fit mooring spot at Datchet.  The mooring rings were deliberately fitted to the edge of the concrete plinth instead of on the top surface of it making it difficult. Then you noticed extremely expensive Georgian houses worth millions and massive flood lights came on as we tied up shining through the boat curtains so as to make your stop as unpleasant as possible. Not a great fan of the Thames as you might guess. What the Thames need are dedicated Narrowboat  stop over marinas designed for movement up the river from Lime House and or Brentford to the Oxford canal.
Good to see that you are NOT getting get lost onboard with all that extra room. You didn't suffer with nosebleeds with that excessive speed? Nice looking boat
This commentary is so reminiscent of childhood memories of Trumpton etc, something nice about listening to it, from another age.The understated humour is so British . Its like children's TV from the 70s for grownups , totally non offensive and a nice change from most of the non informed "shouty "presenters on You Tube , rock on David.
Great video! Enjoyed the Jasper Fforde reference as well!
Those watches were beyond my budget.  My eBay bargain cost £3.99 found whilst I was searching for a new strap!!!
That's the catchiest windshield wiper I've ever heard!
Ha! I recognise your 'boat-wife'! Say hi from me!
I want to hear about the locky situation.  Did he yell at you guys or something?
So you got tired of paying TAG for servicing?
finally a cruising video instead of the junk.
Good to see you back cruising again!  Also, I'm not really a watch-wearer (as in, I don't think I've worn a watch in years), but those Holzkern watches are so beautiful I am sorely tempted to give it another shot. Hmm....
Great vlog was enjoying it  a lot...snacking on some homemade granola.  getting very sleepy feeling great .......then the musical windsheild wipers made me nearly blow chunks of fruit and oatmeal all over my bed..Dang yur funny....😅🤣 Had to watch it twice.. it was so much fun..... can't wait for part 2....thanks mates..always a pleasure. 😊
Great to see you are in command on the water again.
Such a fun video to watch. Your commentary sometimes makes me smile. :-) Lovely river and some beautiful neighborhoods you are boating through. I look forward to Part 2.   I may have loved the sight of the rain on the water more than you both did being in the middle of it. There is something peaceful about a rain storm like that one which reminded me of my childhood summers spent by a Norwegian fjord by Oslo. Thank you for that reminder. I now live thousands of miles from my childhood home, so such reminders are always welcome, even when they have a British touch. :-)
Thanks for the fun!! : )
I liked the watch advertisement. It's higher end then I'll buy, but it was neat to see and I thought you delivered it well. The watches are beautiful.
serene cruise, love it Dave!!!!
From a cheese sandwich to a burger! You are getting spoiled.
I like to know who made the boat you and friend was cruising on I like to have one in the us, or better yet just move over there
I had every intention on complaining about the advertisement but as soon as you said made in Austria I thought oh I'm gonna listen to this, you have my interest now!!!  🤠👍🇦🇹
Loved it ! The Michael Schumacher or Max Verstappen of Inland waterways is not recognized ? ugh !  You are the original man, the Original Gangster, you started this whole Narrowboating vlog thing, who agrees ? LIKE THIS COMMENT  if you agree or remember that he started the whole Narrowboat stories on YouTube,  everyone does it now !
Thanks for another fun video, David; I'm looking forward to Part 2!
Those windscreen wipers are an example of why I always carry a  small can of WD40 whenever dealing with anything mechanical 😊
Very enjoyable,  looking forward to part 2. Thank you.
I am very surprised by all of the comments about the watch company advertising. It was fitted in to the video nicely. The company looks like it makes great products, I don't understand the fuss. I watched the Ad the whole way through. I never heard of this company, and was interested to see what it was about. To me it barely registered as an Ad, because it was fit into the video in a clever way.  No I don't work for the watch company. Don't bother with replies about that.
About the first lock - why would anyone make great people like you not feel welcome...?!?!?
Great video as always David! Great to see Lorna again too. I don't know why but i always get a good out loud laugh at your narration, absolutely love the quick quips like pushing bodies overboard 😂.  Im definitely jealous of the whole UK canal boats, barges and cruisers. Nothing quite like them here in the US. Keep up the great work and looking forward to the next video!
Wonderful boat! Lorna is a great captain. Beautiful watches.  My son is a collector so I will see what I might get him for Christmas. Safe travels.
How difficult is it to pilot a Lefthand, bow driven canal boat compared to a standard boat?
Thanks for the shot of Scholar Gypsy! I can recommend a walk to the top of Wittenham clumps. I've been meaning to do it for years,  and finally managed this summer.  Spectacular view!
Lots of complaints about the ads in the comments but, well, I didn’t have to pay anything to watch this so you are gonna have to pay the bills somehow.  People really need to understand that sponsorships are just part of doing business on YouTube.
Hello from Kansas! Glad to see you guys out and about boating! Thanks!
THUMBS UP "
I apperciate your propensity for a pseudo marriage. This could be the next biggest thing ever...for now. Thanks for the video guys.
Hey, that tiny iceberg is made of swan!  3:42
A marine chronometer is handy so as not to crash on the Isles of Scilly. Looking forward to you using it like John Harrison intended 🙂  Metal meteorite, damn, I may have to buy one of those!
David, no one can narrate a vid like you can ! Great to see you cruising again. Be well and safe journeys. Eric in Oregon
mr cc, long ago you filmed a mooring marked "MOD only, no trespassing".
"good friend" wink wink nudge nudge
My goodness, those houses were massive!! I could live in the boat house!!  I kept thinking of Jerome K Jerome and 3 men in a boat as you slowly moved along...
Never knew the Thames could be so beautiful! Only experience so far was the little stretch behind the (wonderfully eclectic) Monkey Island Estate in Bray.
Well, I got to admit, I've come to realize just how much I missed your comical narratives. Great to see you back on (notice, not in😂) the water.
Perhaps it was mostly your expertise in editing, but my impression is that the upper Thames is a remarkably pretty waterway.
This may seem like a dumb question but here we go. Clearly you are not on tidal waters. Does the River have much of a flow with all the locks?
Looked at some homes in pangbourne. Converted to Canadian dollars the homes are 'reasonable' compared to a similar home in Toronto. Tells you how expensive Toronto is. 3bd 3bth two storey home here is about 2-4m  which is ridiculous.  Plus pang is way more beautiful
Is the River Thames at that point limited to the same speed as canals or is it different given its a river and not a canal
I, too, like the inside drive . Love the wipers. Lol.
Love the boat.🙏🇦🇺👍
You Legend!   Another great video
Good to see you back at the wheel !! Such a beautiful river to cruise on. Looking forward to Part II
Excellent! Gripping commentary! Beautiful scenery and a place from MidSomer Murders. as a 70 year old Mississippian (USA) I love England and would love to see it one day.
Whitchurch Lock, I maybe mistaken,  but I think that this site was featured in one of Midsomer Murder series. Not sure actually which one
Awesome
Everything that I thought about commenting on has already been covered, but I just wanted you to know that I hooted with laughter several times during this video.  Loved the swans coming over to collect the parking up tolls, among others.  Well done!
I have to put my two cents in as well. Glad to see you on the  canals again. Your content is supreme compared to others. Comments are a hoot. Enjoy the rest of the summer. Stay healthy and safe.
:)
Another stupid question, but is there a curfew on the river?  If it got dark can you just keep on traveling along?  Do the Locks close at a certain time?
I wonder if these wide beam boats are available in the US? We recently moved to Alabama and the Tennessee River is navigable to the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes.
Do people usually swim in the river?
Just lovely to see you both together - you made my weekend :)
P.S. nice cushions you have. British & American :-)
Hi Lorna! It's a pleasure to see you!
What a sweet boat! Two en suite bedrooms.    Did I miss you telling us about the engine?  Surprisingly quiet engine.  The windscreen wiper, on the other hand ...  Alex
Absolutely brilliant, my darlings! Thanks so much for sharing ❤️
💖💖💖🇦🇺
Pangbourne was also mentioned in As Time Goes By.
If a hire boat sinks, does it become a lower boat?
9"09 - always good to have a place for pushing bodies overboard!  lol
another great canal video from david and another useless trivia comment by an american: as soon as you said "norfolk broads" it put bowie's song life on mars in my head for the entire video..... 😂
0:32 - What's the point of all the weird strings on the rail, there?  Is it to prevent birds from perching (and pooping) there?
My Coast Guard friend can only relax on a boat.  Compared to fidgety on land.
"Canal Wife" is a rather ambiguous phrase - especially as both of you are on dry land now!
Great boat!
Never expected David to say, "or pushing bodies overboard".  Still chuckling to myself.  😀
I have been to Reading a number of times as we have a UK office there!  Great little city!  🤠👍   Great to see you came to the dark size and use a wheel to do the steering and almost a pilot house!  Nice to be enclosed when you need it.
Just wanted to say that I enjoy your videos so much that I don't mind the ads (and really, you gave us SO MANY hours of videos without ads, so jeez, people, quit being so grumpy!!!!).
Loved the video, you two always seem to have fun when you get together for an adventure, the boat looked lovely,as always the commentary was superb as was the filming.thank you
While it is nice to see and hear you 'cruising' again, I was disappointed by the lack of cheese sandwiches.
What no Cheese sandwich poison
Another interesting video of an area I know well. Lots of movie locations on your route. At Mapledurham near, Reading, 'The Eagle Has Landed' was filmed - I stumbled across it by chance when they were taking a break from shooting the water wheel scene. Other productions filmed there  including 'Miss Marple', 'Midsomer Murders' and 'Sharpe'.
Hi, I am a salmon - thank's for the Benson weir tip.
Not even a cheese burger? You are letting your standards slip.
Blimey !  How old is that boat ?  My wife and I used to cruise the Broads before we got married and that design of craft was around then - and I'm talking 1973. Shortly after you claimed to be a wimp you passed our son's narrowboat on your port side, his blissful home for the past 7 years. Lovely trip !
Ooh memories!  I did this trip on a friend's narrowboat as part of my honeymoon in 1991.  Peak Forest to Goring.
🛥👍👍
you 2 are very good at vlogs, I don't know why, I am too inexperiamnced. but i just get lost in them, its realy great. I hate normat TV, its too stressfull. Thanks, keep it up.
Great to see a cruising video, even better to see you with Lorna!
1:26 visibility looks pretty bad.
The sound of that windshield wiper would drive me to drink. More.
And here I thought the single ladies of the canals swooned in bitter disappointment when I read your title, Mr Darcey of the canals.
I don’t comment often because you get bazillions of comments yes that’s right bazillions but i had to comment today.Your narration was beyond enjoyable thanks. Throwing bodies overboard that was amusing.The watch’s looked really cool yours looked amazing. Hopefully I use this term right. This video was Brilliant.  May Peace Health and Happiness follow you and yours
It's got to be a good boat house if it looks perfectly fine to live in. 🙂
15:04  16:05  Absolutely beautiful. Trippy.
It is so good to watch another of your videos.  You are a consummate professional - the quality of the videography, editing, writing and delivery are exceptional.  Thank you!
another variation on the 'will there be cheese and will it be any good' cliffhanger... get's me on the edge of my seat any time
Boat looks to be an alphacraft 34 one of the more modern boat designs   most "bathtubs" as we call them were built from the late 60s with the first being F.B.Wilds of horning Caribbean class of boats into the 80s without much redesign  by then several more companies were making similar boats including bounty of brundall and aquafibre of rackheath as well as your alphacraft also of brundall
Great video, shows us a completely unexpected view of the quiet, but elegant upper Thames with its historic architecture and parklike setting. It's too narrow to anchor, I suppose? Difficulty finding a place you can legally moor up does add an element of anxiety to planning your cruise. Also, could you provide a link to the video where you introduce Lorna? I'm sure it's my memory deteriorating with age, but I'm not remembering her.  I think inside steering is perfect for the English climate, although if I'd had to listen to that windshield wiper I would have looked for a mooring. Being below decks listening to rain on the deck above was a high point in my own cruising, almost as good as "discovering" a new harbor. Hoping to see Part 2 soon!
Swan = Goos-zilla
Canal Wife 🤔 😆
Can't wait for part 2
Good commentary, very witty in your inimitable style.
Musical wiper and Hawaii Five-O!  A pleasant and interesting journey shot and edited with charm and humor.  This was fun, looking forward to part 2, if you survived the food poisoning. 😀
Hello CC & Lorna. A great video and adventure. About 30 years ago I went from Henley to Windsor by canoe with two scouts. A great trip, a couple of locks have a “slide” of two channels, like a two tractor tracks, and the water overflows down them. Combined with a bit of algae they make great slides for canoes, saves portage or going through the locks and sharing with large boats made of tougher materiel than a small GRP canoe. Great memories.
That thing looks like a spaceship.
something i appreciate youtubers doing is having a bar that slowly shrinks during the time of sponsored segments, or having the segment time marked in the chapters
Pushing bodies overboard.  Love it!
A clump of geese is not quite as spectacular as a flamboyance of flamingos.
Was enjoying the journey until the watch advert.x good night
What a great video again and nice to see Lorna, I can't wait for the next part.
Gorgeous riverside views.   Thanks for the ride-along.     I spent 1.5 years in England 3 decades ago, 20 miles east of Cambridge.  I found it lovely, much like my home ground in Western Oregon, USA, near Eugene.  Major differences being warmer and drier summers, and no canals.  However, there is a large river there as well, the Willamette.
The body disposal cutout on the stern is a handy feature!  😃
The boat seems to have TARDIS qualities.....
I used to deliver all around there but as it was by road, I never saw these lovely, green views!
",,pushing bodies overboard" 😅 How we miss that rain in Spain!!
Nice to see you  both. Has to be a bit different steering from the front of the boat, with a wheel rather than with a tiller at the stern. You did well
Makes me want to go and hire a boat.I have done it twice many years ago
I usually don't watch ads in YouTube videos, but there some really nice watches.  Having seen Producer Michael's frequent watch purchases and views, these were very, very affordable.
What, no can of pineapple?
It was like going back in time to when you had your own narrow boat and did the wonderful narrations as you traveled the world of English canals. I greatly enjoyed part 1
You two need a channel together. 👍🏼don’t be shy David. 😎
I'm happy when you two team up. Like you both separately, but you do make a good team. Thanks for the videos.
Love it always nice to be on the water enjoy
The sound of those window wipers was crazy.🤪
I really miss your cruising videos.
You have been reading fforde
Good to see you and the "wife" out on the river.
Good to see you out on the water again. Very enjoyable video through scenic countryside.
What a lovely boat. I wish my daddy would buy me one like that! What, no pictures of Toad Hall?!Remember Prof. Sumner Millar's science classes replays on TV? "If you want to cook it quick, cook it slow", in relation to meat Burgers.
Thank you for this great video! I love watching your cruising videos after a long day!  Groetjes uit Nederland
These videos make me happy.  Thank you!
...  Lovely Scenery.  #HappySunday #Everyone
"Pushing bodies overboard" 🤣 So that's what happened to the grumpy people at the lock! 🙂
Great adventuring with you & Lorna! Eager for Part Two!
Lovely looking area.  I have visited a couple of times but found the locals somewhat aloof, shall we say.
I was fishing today near where you started out (was at Appleford). Lovely part of the world. Would I be correct in assuming it was the lock-keeper at Culham who wasn't very welcoming?
Ah, Abingdon! Famous among MG enthusiasts!
I have to say I recently discovered your channel and im really enjoy it,your voice sounds so professional,thank you
No cheese sandwiches, I'm very disappointed .
Lovely vlog! Your channel was the first one I’ve ever subscribed to and that was back when you first started, so you know I’m loyal to a fault. The controversy over embedded adverts is sticky…if the brand doesn’t mind, would suggest putting it at either end of the vlog so those who pay for ad-free vids can anticipate where it will be and can sail past or bug out before the credits roll. Whatever you pick, stay with that format so your viewers will know. This system seems to work well for other content makers that I watch. Also….you needn’t speak so hurriedly when you put the advert on the front or rear of the vlog. Putting it in the middle seems to make the whole thing feel pushier which we all know is not your style! Personally, I watch all your videos to the end because I find them to be so enjoyable. That would NOT change if there was a hand-crafted advert for dessert! Keep up the awesome work!   ❤❤❤
Well, an invitation to borrow a canal boat for a few days, that's too hard to resist once you have been bitten by the narrowboat cruising bug.  So nice to see Lorna again as well!  I really like that boat, especially steering up front, sitting down in a comfortable seat, and best of all, out of the weather.  The sliding hatch is also a nice feature - Enjoy!
I could go cruising with Lorna,she floats my boat😅
Are you permitted to keep traveling after dark, or is it just convenience and safety that compels you to tie up at night?
I hear the wipers saying……I hate this..I hate this 😡😡🤣🤣
In my experience that area might well be the snootiest and most unfriendly part of the world.
A new CruisingTheCut video! Perfect accompaniment to my afternoon G&T! Lovely to see Lorna again! 9:09 Ah the real reason for David's boat adventure, body disposal! Can't wait for Episode 2.
Ooh, the idea of being cozy (and dry) inside a boat with the rain sounds and a little fire and/or hot cocoa to complete my contentment. ❤
The Dutch barge was spectacular 🤠🤠🤠
I've hired boats on the Norfolk Broads a few times but either midships or aft helm positions, never one of those at the front, not sure how I'd cope with that, but it looked comfortable enough, everything you need onboard.  Nice video as always, thanks.
Your boatmate is very funny 😂😂😂
A musical windshield wiper! Na-na-na-num-naah, na-na-na-num-naah! LOL
As a long time follower of this channel I am extremely disappointed that commercialism has crept in. Once David started spouting on about his 'fancy watch' I signed off. Not for me anymore David ,but thank you for your past videos which I appreciated very much.
Good video!  Burger, all beef, veggie or Yak?  🇨🇦
That part of the Thames is very beautiful, a few years ago I camped near there and really enjoyed cycling and exploring the area.
The boat looks like similar to the type offered by silver marine in Brundell (and the same colour!) We preferred the steering in the middle of the boat and a raised cockpit. I found that looking at the rear of the boat at times allows you to see how much the boat is turning. It certainly helped me. They are quite nice boats, but not having been on a narrow boat I can’t make a good comparison.
Very interesting , something  different  for the both of you to try out.
"... So we fired up the musical windscreen wiper.  It's not quite Hawaii Five-O is it?"  This is the humor that I love so much.
I really like this boat!
Thoroughly enjoyed the video . Thank you
Ironically, just been on the same type of boat only last week and headed up the Thames  from Goring. It was a happy event of scattering my fathers ashes near South Stoke , where we spent many happy years mooring up and having a fun boating time. What our captain said, who was a friend of my fathers and still had his boat, long after he sold his due to getting too old to use. The lock keepers have said that traffic this year is down 60% on previous years. We found the river virtually all to ourselves , compared to when we boated of hire boats flat out to get the whole Thames in their week hire. Just weird how you had the same boat for your video. Was good to see you enjoyed it.
Looks like an ex Silverline  Marine hire boat by the colour scheme out of Brundtland on the Norfolk Broads now sadly so.d out to Richardsons of Stalham
As annoying as the adverts are, they keep YouTube free for those of us that don't have or are unable to afford the premium service. That was a lovely watch you have there. It's  nice to see someone look at their wrist for the time instead of their phone.
On the Thames you dont need to read the signs on the bank as they will all say" Private,  No mooring"
I’d like to see you take an offer of crewing on the fastnet 😉 :-)
Love the sound of rain on the roof, very soothing 👍 - enjoyed that, thank you 🙏
Brill stuff..well done on your new adventure..very comical.. thoroughly enjoyed it 😂.. thanks for sharing kind regards Dave 😁👍👍👍 we look forward to part 2..
While we're on the subject (of comparing narrowboats and wide-beams in the comments):  A German couple uploaded their narrowboat travels (aboard Ange de l'Eau) to https://youtu.be/-46U2KdunHM?si=DQHU5efsN03JyiJv, bought a cruiser (Old Gilly) in the Netherlands, shared their Dutch travels on https://youtube.com/@oldgillysreisen9821?si=Qe2PNBNaG4TV1KYC, and now are on the home stretch in Germany.
Well done David great video. When I saw " the wife" in the title, I thought, David wouldn't be daft enough would he???? Alas it was Lorna so everything was back to normal. Didn't like the look of dinner second evening better with a cheese sandwich. Roll on episode number 2.
Always a pleasure
This is my neck of the woods -great to see you here! Lovely to see familiar scenery from the river instead of the bank. Look forward to part 2.
What and where is the source of the Thames?
I recognise that boat! It was featured in @the-english-couple videos last summer.
Where is the butter in the beef burgers ?
🧐minced meat instead of cheese??? What has this world become....lol..jk...another great vid, though I felt a bit sorry you two looked so pitiful all soaking wet....hope you adventure is a good time!
I fully understand why you need to make money creating these videos, but being a viewer of your channel for years now, I was really disappointed when the first "these videos are sponsored by" started appearing. But this has to be the worst one for me. Advertising a watch company! 🙄 Sneaking in an advertisement half way through the video has to be the worst thing to do. I pay yt premium for a reason.
Still appreciating and enjoying your videos, David!  I first found Cruising the Cut on Prime, and that's how I got into YouTube.  :)   (2019)
That wiper reminds me of a dying animal...does that motor need fixing?
15:15 The late George Michael's house is just on the left up the little channel that the footbridge crosses over.
Just a picky point! Swans don't have chicks, they have cygnets!
What sorts of things might a lock keeper do or say to make one feel unwelcome?  Perhaps he or she was just feeling a bit cranky toward all comers that day, or thoughts of doing other pursuits were at top of mind and the arrival of your boat was an unwanted interruption?
"...private gardens are not places where you can stop..." - Fortuna fortunatis adjuvat :) (or in Englisch: Fortune favours the bold!)...so yes: You can stop, but most likely the owners will not like it :D
So good to see you back on the boats with your 'missus' David! The Canal youtuber community is pretty unique and brilliant and although a few have become permanent landlubbers in the past couple of years so good to see it still going strong, the friendships and collaborations between you all is a tonic.
Hooray ! This is really charming. Musical wipers. Gorgeous scenery. David and Lorna. Who could ask for anything more ?
Loved watching you guys on the river Thames and the Swan's loved you too I see. They don't like me much paddling past them on my kayak and I'm z little wary of them too as I'm at head height to them arch.  Great video looking forward to part 2.😅😊 Kev the Brinklow kayaker❤
Given your collective celebrity status, I'm surprised that any lock-keeper anywhere would have the temerity to be grouchy with you. The whole episode seemed a bit fast, though (speed-wise)... not the charming, sedate pace that your boating usually features. I'm surprised that you managed it without the power of cheese sandwiches, frankly. Looks like it was great fun. Looking forward to part deux.
Sponsor of todays vid is.... Getting like other yt stuff sold out for dollars 😮 use to be good fun watching entertaining vids of yours😢 oh well...off button beckons 😮
Great video. It's a shame that neither of you seems of much use in the kitchen. Having said that at least it's not cheese sandwiches again! :-)
Great. Well done. Thanks .
Certainly enjoyed the beauty of the upper Thames. Much appreciated. Looking forward to the next chapter. Be well and stay safe.
I love that you referenced resurrected dodos in Reading! I'm a huge Thursday Next fan. Probably the only one in Kansas!
Part 1 so relaxing….await 2 for overall view
Don't give the birds crappy bread or crackers. It is very bad for them. As someone said, peas (fresh or frozen) is good.
Wittenham Clumps features in Time Team.
Just checked out those watches. I thought they would be totally out of my reach price wise, but they’re really reasonable for a posh kind of watch. Very beautiful and unique designs.
Your advert is wasted on me. I lived my whole life by the time. Sea Watches. Railway timetables. Being on duty! The first thing I did when I retired was throw my issued time piece into the sea.
That rain!!
19:06 So funny
Great video. Happy memories of a round trip in our narrowboat Swallowtail down the Oxford, up to Lechlade, then downriver and back up the Grand Union. The upper Thames is truly stunningly beautiful.
Nice! I think I would like the sitting down, front steering too! Plus the fact that their is a nice bit of space for when the weather is foul, and en suite bathrooms for both bedrooms!  I saw this boat (or a similar one) when Mr. Sage gifted a vacation to another couple of Youtube vloggers already.  I think I would feel safer on this sort of a vessel on the Thames than a narrowboat if I was doing a big trip.  Oh yes, can you please look to see if any of those canal homes with boathouses are for sale?  🧐 Let me know.  Ha ha ha ha ha.....
Brilliant.   Always wanted one of this broads cruisers in my younger days.  Brilliant cruise.  Seems very iffy where u can and cannot moor on the Thames.   Can’t wait for part two.
14:57 What is that circular area at the point of the bow? A strange place for a cup holder
Drove trains across that girder bridge. Wondered what it looked from that angle.
Great to see Lorna again!
Reading 👍👍 my neck of the woods do miss you not being on the canal
That hilly section of the river was just awesome to see!
Watches sorry boring.
9:08 Haha. They should get ‘The Plank’ too
Oh that was such beautiful scenery. Particularly loved the bridges.
These are great videos and adventures. I love watching them.
😂 That windshield wiper sounded more like a stuck record needle than anything musical. Sorry.  But glad to see a bit of England one usually doesn't see from a narrow boat.
Not a single mention not even a whiff of a cheese sandwich.  What is going on?
love that boat!! you two have so much fun lovely to see..
Awesome houses, and mostly non-narrowboat. This is what I normally see in central europe too.
What a beautiful journey. Thank you for sharing.
After living on a narrow boat you could probably live on top that boat house in comfort!
Nice Doctor Who reference ("Turn Left"). What a great trip to enjoy on the Thames. Hope to make our own travels on it next Summer. Thanks for posting.
How come I can never find the links?  I’d like to watch Lorna’s version too.
Love this video! Just remember you are forward, so everything swings behind you. It is more your perspective as opposed to steering. In those turns leave room for the stean to swing.
Lovely.  It was delightful to be back on a boat with you David.
Holy clarky David swapped a cheese sandwich for a hamburger on a bun.  Al this malarkey on the river is getting to his head.
Your fellow  crew members boating skills are scary and lacking.
Ah happy memories. For years I cycled past your last mooring point on the way to and from work. Looking forward to part 2.
You two need to take a trip to Roys of Wroxham and have some fun on the Norfolk Broads
The team is back together again. I still remember the classic Christmas video you two did a few years ago. It gave Alistair Sim a good run for his money. That boat seems to be very well designed. Fresh air when you want and full coverage for the inclement weather.
A space for “pushing bodies overboard”. Priceless. 😂🤣 Whittenham Clumps is an enjoyable climb with great views. Lovely to see you both enjoying my stretch of the Thames very close to home. 👍😎
Practicing for the syncronised take were off they ?   Good stuff , tres droll
Excellent commentary! I've aways rather liked these river cruisers - must be a big advantage being GRP and not needing blacking or being at risk of corrosion I'd have thought. I understand the head height inside these kinds of boats tends to be a bit on the low side though.
From Deb…wonderful vlog! Than you so much for all your work to produce this.
That’s a cool boat with the sliding hatch like that 👍🏼👍🏼…but that boat in front of y’all was huge , so wide I’ll bet there’s a lot of canals that thing ain’t making it in..
You could have moored up in Wallingford.  The bit on the right just before the bridge is available for public mooring.  There is a small charge per night and a nice lady with a dog comes round and collects your fee.
LOVE IT.  CHEERS
Hi David.  I live not far from Pangbourne.  In fact we've met mum and your dad at the Swan for lunch a few times.  Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin fame apparently used to drink in there.     Interesting video which I shall show to Samantha's dad as he used to be an inspector on that stretch of the Thames and down towards Windsor.  He had many encounters with famous people living along the riverside, some more pleasant than others and has many interesting stories.
Just lovely, David. Some of those homes with the boathouses. Wowza!
Now I’m wondering what happened to upset the first lock keeper, got out of the wrong side of the bed perhaps.
🤣Ha, not so synchronized a takeoff if you stop in in mid-takeoff. 😂
Hi David, I’m contemplating a life change. Would a boat like that one, but of course narrower, be suitable for live aboard? How much would one have to pay, for an elderly one?
Poetic gem as usual. Love the interwoven humour.  I wish I had been on that journey.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That was lovely! Looking forward to part 2! Thanks!
I was thinking of getting a speed boat for some wizzing down the Thames but the lack of petrol stations has put me off.
I do miss my cruising on the Norfolk Broads days... what ever happen to Hoseasons and Blake boats?
Great video both of you.  So relaxing.
Born, bred and grew up in Pangbourne and Purley on Thames. Great place to do that as a kid and many fond memories. It was a relatively "normal" area that "normal" people could afford live in up until about 20yrs ago. Those days are long gone. To be honest, its been gentrified and is a bit pretentious now. But its on a commuter route, so times move on. Still spend a lot of time working and playing along the Thames between Reading and Abingdon. I do count myself lucky!
this did make me laugh David! XD the throwing bodies over the back of the boat and the musical windscreen wiper. lol looking forward to the next part! thanks for the entertainment as always David. 🙂
David, so pleased you keep finding new places and stories to tell.
Hawaii five o.  Bwaaaaaaa.  That was great David
Always enjoy cruises along canals or rivers. Not just any river but the Thames, awesome. for sharing     ⛴ ⛴ ⛴⛴⛴
The rule I live by as a ocean sailor:  If it might rain? Goretex. If it is raining? Plastic and Rubber.  Nothing worse than damp clothes when humidity is 100%. Great to see Lorna again.  Good to see the swans again. It's been a while.  Now, I guess they're property of the king....    If I ever befriend a swan I'm going to call him Oliver Cromwell.
Nice !
I hope you do get together, as you are very well suited tbh. Xx
that sliding roof is really cool, seems James Bond-ish
Far older than canals, Roman villas to manors dotted  the banks. One can imagine a raft loaded with stone bound for London town and the lot sold.
What an entertaining wall of subtitle text at the beginning. :)
Looking forward to part 2.... even if just to see if you survive the burgers😂😂
The  word  'THE ' implies  object...should  be  titled  my  wife  and I...great  video....
Ant on deck love it
Loved it. First vid I've watched since the format change.  Also that women is totally into you mate.
At first reading on the title, I thought you where going from Abingdon, VA to Reading, PA on your boat. The joke is on me!   I do love your videos.
A group of geese on the ground is a gaggle when they are on the wing its a skane so is there yet another term if they are on water ? Ive never heard geese being referred  to as a clump .
LOL I have always wondered about those two. Ant and Deck I mean. In a few days it will be declared as true and official in the tabloid press based on spotting this boat. That's about the limit of their research.
david would you know where your narrow boat ended up?
The houses on the Thames are largely huge!  🙂 Nice to see Lorna with a smile on her face, for a change - she's been a bit down in the dumps recently - mind she doesn't do a safety inspection, though!
Hi David. Now that’s an interesting boat to be sure.
'Lock keeper found after 8hrs treading water in Abingdon lock 'Police 'mystified' 😆😆
Thanks a lot for this vlog. finally one again
Well, if you have to travel with a wife at least you each got your own bed & bath to help keep things civilized 😁. Very interesting looking at cruising from such a different boat perspective. I bet sitting down and steering inside is a very welcome difference, particularly when the weather gets nasty. Being so much smaller than a narrowboat must make it easier to steer and even finding small mooring spots you couldn't use otherwise. But of course your inside space is much more limited. Still for just a few days, hardly an issue. Looking forward to Part 2. Hope no one ends up in the drink! Oh, and very sorry to hear about the unpleasant lock keeper near the start. Bet that's an exception rather than the rule. 😊
That wzs a very gracious offer for the use of the boat. Enjoyed the video !! 😊😊
And now.. something completely different! Awareness gymnastics for narrowboat enthousiastics. Your vlogs always deliver unusual topics. The pun stays the same of course, never a dull moment - with a smile. A cleverly designed boat indeed.
Your Goring lock is in fact Cleeve... Also when you mention wind in the willows youre looking at the house where Led Zepplin were founded, it was Jimmy Page's house at the time...
17:22 I wouldn't mind living somewhere that looks like that.
hi sorry for ne spelling...lol  lots of goslings but no gone gooselers lol.. food poisoning..lol dose that make her a miserable little burger lol oh i am glade I'm getting better...lol maybe take care all you to david.. naughty ole me
Thank you David, you and Lorna and great ❤
"What are we having for diner?" "Food poisoning!" Waaahahahahahaha gotta love that English humor. Wonderfully chill video once again.
Sailing on the stars, pushing bodies overboard? Cruising the cut with Captain David Sparrow...
Sleeping on a boat while listening to the rain sounds heavenly. I must admit even your adverts are entertaining. Thanks for the ride along.
HAHA   A GREAT VIDEO FOR SURE!!! David, i think this is one of your VERY best!! As you said its not hawaii 5-0 but in every way, much better!! Not a dull moment in wonderful views and not a boring moment of you not telling us educational and interesting or some fun!!  A beautiful boat for sure,,,,and alllll the sights along the way were also. Glad to see you doing well and of course in great spirits and willing to do the hard work and planning involved to give us a GREAT experience!! God Bless your every endeavor!! Bill in north alabama here,,,
I do miss your canal videos.
A lovely trip so far.  The views of the scenery, meaning watching for the next perfect, expensive and beautiful homes in the river, were satisfying.  Satisfying in that I could enjoy looking but don't pay the taxes!  Thank you for continuing to share.
flock of geese
⛴ ⛴ ⛴⛴⛴
warning stay upwind of him!
Amazingly beautiful Marina and houses. Quality video as always
That cruise looks like fun!👍 Thank you for sharing. 😊
I hate the noise of yhe children
Got to love a Broads cruiser - it's a holiday me and the missus do every year. If you ever get the chance David, give it a go!
Loved seeing Lorna with big smile! Food poisoning..😂😂
Making me want to hire a boat again (narrowboat or Broads cruiser, I'm not sure yet). Might be a little while though, since I'm not sure of the logistics with a newborn, but once she's ready to be in a full-sized bed...
Having only ever done boating on the Broads, indoor boating is great when the weather is bad, never even thought about doing the Thames, one to add to the list.
does your wife know your going boating with another woman?
Great vlog, looks like edds boat also used by Richard and Julia......
Why are there so many locks on the Thames?  One would think that it would be possible to just boat on the river.
Yayyy I've been looking forward to this since Lorna's posts on instagram haha
Boy....I have missed that voice and the beautiful scenery 😊
I have an important question for you David. As you're a landlubber these days, how long did it take you to rediscover your "sea legs" ?!! 😅😅
It was inevitable that the two love birds would get together for a Summer cruise together. A lovely surprise for us all. Will we get get to see P2 after those burgers cooked by Lorna? I do hope so. See you there. 😆🖖
Lovely video,. Steering with a wheel instead of a tiller looks intimidating, but that love the sliding hatch on the boat. Interestingly, also felt unwelcome in one lock between Abingdon and Reading (and very welcome in all of the others).
The best boats have a place to push bodies out of. 👍
Do u have snakes in your parts? It looks real snaky to me
Great to see you two together again!❤
So lovely to see you boating again. I do miss your videos of your full-time cruising and living on the boat. This reminds me of those. Thank you.
I don't even wear a watch but some of those look REALLY good!!
Haha, well anyways, you sound just like husband and wife.
Peas. Bring a can of peas. Swans love peas.
Great seeing you and ‘the wife’ on board again. Hope to take a cruise up the Thames next year, following your trip through London.
Can you operate your boat at night on the move? And thank you for your time so very much.
This is the drive set up id take over the stand out back and hope for the best kind lol
The wife, eh... Kept that one a secret 🤣🤣
Jeez that's a heck of a neat looking boat. What a unique design!
oh my. Sadly i don't have time to watch right now. Saved it for later. Hugs and kisses to you and Lorna
Advanced Christmas shopping? Boots have just released their Advent calendars......Perfect timing, a bit like the watches, no doubt.👍
I've boated along that stretch of the Thames. Yes, some very nice houses !
Congratulations on your recent wedding. Many happy returns.
This video made for a lovely Saturday day afternoon watch. Thank you again for what you do. I swear listening to you talk in your videos could be turned into  Zen Buddhist audio. You have a very calm demeanor sir! I am always excited to see a new post! :-)
Really enjoying seeing this adventure - especially through someone else's eyes. Glad you had a good time - looking forward to part 2!
There’s a joke in there about Cruising the Cut getting me wet…but I shall resist the urge…
Great to see you and Lorna on the water! Stay dry 😂
A long-standing viewer offered me and my "canal wife" (aka good friend) Lorna the use of his boat on the upper River Thames for a few days - thanks Ed! - which we were delighted to accept.
