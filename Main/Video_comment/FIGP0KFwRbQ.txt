Welcome back, Daniel! 🇦🇺
So well presented, thank you!
Now svg in nascar
tthank you
Y'all videos are amazing!
One of the best Australians and the best Australian Red Bull could have ever asked for! 🇦🇺 ❤
i like to imagine that Daniel literally just has the RB7 in his shed. Like it's just chilling there.
🎉😊❤
average red bull drivers morning
Ricciardo in this video didn't age well 2 years later
Danny Ric, i’ll miss you my dude 🫡🫶🏻
Can we please just make F1 Off Road racing an official thing? Thank you...
Man and machine!!!!!!!
They need to remove the walmart logo
What's that skip you just saw a F1 car lol 😂😂😂😅😅😅
This is giving Forza Horizon vibes
daniel existing after losing his f1 seat. redbull:hey we want you to drive on the sand with a not so safe redbull f1 car. daniel:bet
RedBull will go anywhere and do anything with the RB9
This is the dumbest, most cringe, fake shit I've ever seen. And I'm absolutely here for it.
Normal day in australia:
Australia is a very underrated continent.
just found out this company sells energy drinks who knew!!!
they probably get data this way to upgrade their most recent car
Love Bathurst!
So original. I dunno how is the motor after swallowing tons of dust
Огонь 🔥🔥💓🔥🔥 , большое спасибо всей команде!!! Прекрасное видео, супер - челендж!!😊❤❤
I hope in 2025 season DR will be back driving for Oracle Red Bull Racing again.
no team out there that could beat RED BULL
How many cars did you break filming those dirt road scenes?  No really....how many?
So Daniel stole the RB7, Red Bull found out
I am so happy! Daniel looks so happy with RB!
It's incredible how Red Bull has great athletes in almost very sport you can imagine.
even though this man earns more than me in two months than I will earn in my lifetime, he's still likeable. He's respectful, humble (he seems like a man who can enjoy his successes  with the understanding that  it's not only his success and, good looking (mainly because he doesn't get cought without a smile) but.... I'm sure that many would agree; handome bugger.
OMG!! Offroad tires on an F1!! LOLzzz
Thanks you red bull. I taken what mine. Thanks you. Mmuahh. I need you more
good job to Daniel doing this, the italian francesco f1 guy from cars really struggled 👏👏
Red Bull brings all the boys to the yard!!!
AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE 🇦🇺
The best ❤
Perhaps RB should stick to nice video/images, not let people speak.  The people sound as natural as the actors in the radio plays from the nineteen twenties.
Welcome back and carefull with #rdebullracist  and dint aply cero tolerance with Helmut actitude
Helmut's statements stink and are unacceptable💩💩💩💩💩
We race as one! Right? Zero tolerance! Or is it?
Racist bulls
Cuando van a despedir a "helmut marko " por racista?  hasta cuando? Los mexicanos lo esperan con mucha atencion en Mexico, a ver como le va por miserable.!  P.D. Mexico esta en Norte America, semejante falto de conocimiento BASICO
CERD. Red Bull ya dimos denunciamos a helman marcó con la organización así es que ustedes dicen que hacemos la denuncia está
Ya basta del racismo de Redbull. Marko debe disculparse por sus comentarios contra Checo por ser SUDAMERICANO.  YA BASTA DEBEMOS BLOQUEAR A REDBULL EN TODOS LOS SENTIDOS.  SON RACISTAS.
imagine u r just coming out from 7eleven and there's a F1 car with the driver
The worlds happiest man in his element
This was a Great Video, but we all know RedBull and that Pit Stop goes faster (we are not Ferrari).
There is no other team that does such crazy things with their drivers as Red Bull, just because they are very good at it and have a lot of fun doing it. There's a time to work and there's a time to have fun, lots and lots of fun.
Only McLaren and Mercedes allowed teammates to compete and decide titles on track. That is motorsport.
You guy are wasting Checo's talent by holding him back. You guys know he can outscore Max given same set car. He is a true and worthy winner. The reason you took him is because he is capable of winning from the tail end. You did the same with Webber. I wish you never achive 8 constructor titles in a row like Mercs did. Anyway you have not beaten 5 in a row what Ferrari did.
Even if Ricciardo is brought back to replace Checo, Max will remain primary point scorer not coz he is faster but RB provides him a superior set car coz knowing RB has the fastest car they don't wish to divide race wins with the other driver. Goal is to beat Ham's record 100+ wins. But with 2026 regulation change I doubt if Max can beat Michaels's record before the regulation change. Who knows AMRs, Mercs, Ferraris or even Ferrari bounce back!
Denle un Oscar a Checo y Horner por sus iconicas actuaciones
Awesome!
Why get data for the RB 7 when your gonna use the rb19
Very cool they allow them to do this f1 teams usually don't like thier cars anywhere but in a race
I'm LOVING this, just AWESOME guys!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
how much i love this video? yes!
francesco bernoulli vs everyone
I wonder how much of it is CGI 😅
RB 7 with Honda (HRC) engine?
whos here after daniel ricciardo replaces nyck de vries at alpha tauri?
WHO THE HELL EDITED THIS BC LIKE JESUS CHRIST i am very impressed
This is AWESOME!
He reminds me of the stig
This is so stupid. I love it.
Liam larson drove that car
I wonder if any of the other teams will ever catch on that YouTube is a great tool for marketing their brand
I thought Shane was a kiwi 😂
The Honey Badger is baaaaackkkk!!!
This is how you do a promo
Australia is such a cool country, cool slang, accent and way of life. Cheers from the US.
lol the map makes it look like Sea Cliff bridge is hours away from Sydney when it's really only 1-2 hours depending on traffic..  40mins if you do it in the middle of the night :P
Love it ❤
LOVE IT!! Danny is the best ambassador for Red Bull racing ever!
I didn't know I'd needed to watch an F1 off-road race, but turns out, after watching this, I need to see a (real) F1 off-road race. Time to start a new category of racing.
That's why I love RedBull...
l o l
That was mostly Liam Lawson, if not all Liam
red bull has marketing and the marketing is daniel
❤Ricciardo... 👎🏻Verstappen
I think it's safe to say DR should be the official F1 spokesperson for Redbull. Great to see him back!
Happy to see daniel❤❤
This is why I love Redbull. They do stuff like this.
You could easily make a Daniel Ricciardo series.
Good job Redbull team to show Daniel driving an orange tractor in the beginning 🤣. I see what you did here !
Would've been brilliant..... If it was Daniel driving... Liam Lawson did a great job... Why the BS pretending it was Daniel? 👎
Good-luck getting stuck in the middle of the Outback with engine problems.
I love how they are playing cricket to refrence the Australian a great cricketing nation
perfection i love vds like this
Hope my entrance was OK by my short greenscreen and black screen i did hope the red bull company got it stressing me a lil
I just love this track, would be awesome one GP there!
Awesome
Cringe level 11
Why isn't Thriller Miller in this video?!
Liam lawson can drive
Have some fun🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
👍👍👍👍
The crew 2 be like 1:27
Red Bull scared to sign Danny cause they scared he’ll beat max. Again.
Me in the Aussie video game cutscene with my custom skin
Red Bull and Danny treating real life like it’s forza horizon
Aussie is truly the turned upside American   Honey badger return
Liked for the real fastest and verified best driver in all of F1 😤  Top gear homies know
Who knew the Australian Grand Prix would end up being even more chaotic and ridiculous than this? 😂 Can't believe we got 3 red flags.
Danny Ric is a national treasure.
I LOVE THESE!! Red Bull is great haha The Pit crew showing what they do as well! Ricciardo is back home baybee!
All that budget, and that's the best they can do.
To think they just did this for fun.
8:31 interesting screen
Most extreme contrast between some of the cheesiest production, and great footage I've ever seen. Final third was great though.
So Daniel Ricciardo confirmed as Red Bull reserve driver, test driver.    What amazing team up!!
Awesome content guys thank you 👌🏿❤️
Red Bull just put Daniel on a orange trator 💀
So GOOD TO SEE DANNY RICK SMILING FACE AGAIN..HONEY BADGER
if daniel  didnt leave RB  he would have 1 championship a d max would have 1.  daniel has been the only rb driver that on occacion performed better and most of the time on par with max.. and this is comming from a max verstappen fan.
To think what Mad mike & red bull started on the Crown Range now to this (With a little bit of Hoonigan Gymkhana thrown in for good measure), this was awesome! SVG and Daniel on mount Panorama was special.
Red Bull. What a crock. You can’t even acknowledge the people that helped you do this. Rural QLD is actually Central NSW. A lot if people donated their time to help you do this and you just snobbed them. Piss poor.
They weren't wrong about the craziness of turn 1 and 2
@ORACLE RED BULL RACING. I still love the brand, but would you please pay more attention to Checo's Garage? His car has had the most issues since joining RedBull. Are you interested on improving it? if so, can you demonstrate what will be done to stop this? why can Checo's car be as ready and perfect as the other car?
Australiaaaaaaaaaaaaaa❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂❤❤😂
Riccccccardoooooo❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You guys were not kidding about Turn 1 chaos ...
when engines roared!
like watching a horizon showcase irl
Красивый клип.  Правда кто этот фермер Риккардо?
damn hatsoff ddrone pilot
seeing daniel in a rb uniform makes my heart warm 💖
I thought in Australia it was against the law for TV commercials to show cars going fast on the roads.
Daniel driving in the McLaren at the beginning 🧡 shows his love for the team
This is so cringy. Mt Panorama scene was ok though.
5:01 Turn 1 Chaos
Nothing could have prepared anyone for the last 5 laps of the Australian GP tbh 😂
I really like Daniel Ricciardo driving around in RB19 in the outback in Australia 🇦🇺 with the f1 car 🏎.
Daniel!!!
The athletes down at redbull Australia are basically all round extreme sports stars
Proper build up
Well done team and good luck Daniel
Danny Ric… he needs a world title…
Please don't expect us to believe bs.we are RB fans,not someone you can tell fairytale stories to.this looks bad for Daniel and Liam
Flippin’ awesome! 🤘🏽🤘🏽
400 hrs spent making this video. 10 min of footage, the rest was spent replacing air filters on the F1.
The best roadtrip team to be with More crazy (in all the great way) adventures please 🙂 I know F1 is your mainline but can we also see the other Red Bull teams as well? The dirt bike, baja, suppercars, the sky diving, aero stunt and all others under the Red Bull team 😊
I don't know about anyone else but it feels so right to see Danny back in a bull
Wish they would prepare a more recent car, not so much a fan of the older sowing machine they are still using
How can you do me like this...I would love to see F1's on Bathurst.
He may not be the world champion but still he is everyone's favourite❤
Daniel will be driving for the team next year
the sound of the old engine💦
Ugh I hope Danny's happy, that would make me happy
Yo,we need behind the scene
Max no 1 , he was already 5 time world champion now if he drove a Benz in the past like lewis  ... So lewis , go to sleep so that George can go forward with his team. Everybody saw what happen , George could win his 1 st race with Benz .,...because the car was sooooo goooood
yeeeeha!
Wicked 💯
I hope Daniel is back in the seat fighting Max. Although that is probably unlikely, still let's hope so!
Most people don't know this, but...Red Bull is actually a marketing company... It doesn't produce/manufacture any products, it's kinda a sweet business model... I'll help you understand if you need.
Red Bull is the best at doing this. No doubt about it!
Cringeworthy
That was an absolute cracker !! Team Redbull know how to put on a party 😂🎉
What an amazing 3rd driver
Show of hands here: who loves Daniel?!!? Me! Me! Me!
Daniel Ricciardo: 'Why did the F1 car cross the Outback?' 🤔 Oracle Red Bull Racing: 'To get to the other side, mate!' 🦘😂 Outback Wildlife: panicking in Australian 🐨 #GDaySpeedway #F1DownUnder
Now that Ken is no longer with us.... RIP.... Is this F1 gymkhana....
what a screm from a v8. the good old days
Good times!! 🇦🇺🇦🇺
What's wincup doing in the video. Craig lowndes should be in there
How original a bike jumping a car 😴
Very entertaining. Totally worth it.
I found the intro rather intriguing. Perfect storyline for a straight-to-Netflix action film, espionage down under.. _Danny Ricc Off Grid, the Turbo Tractor Farmer_
Imagine hitting a kangaroo in that.
Red Bull 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Getting Daniel back was the most genius move by Red Bull marketing. What a legend.
#ricciardobackinf1
Welcome home mate! This was a fun bit of marketing for the Au GP. Daniel is back where he belongs (in Red Bull colours). I just wish that this video was longer. Any chance of a making of video?
What a video
Danniieeeelllll❤❤❤❤❤❤
7/11 scene is dope
Fantástic!
fh5 ?
Give this man a drive in the rb19. Just a FP session. I think he is still fast as hell when given a proper car and not that shitbox of a mclaren or that even worse renault.
Forza Horizon 5 DLC: F1 Grand Prix with rally tires
I’ve always been a fan of Dani Ric but this is where I finally realized this is what he was made to do. He’s a showmen and really great at what he does and why you can’t help but like him. He just never had that killer instinct at red bull that Seb had before him and Max had/has after him. I think he should focus on being strictly a personality for F1 going forward he will have tons of opportunities down the road.
I hope Dan finds a seat for 2024, he belongs to F1!
YEAH BUDDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’ve always loved Redbulls marketing. Can’t stand Max……. But Daniel and Checo 🤙🏿🤙🏿🤙🏿🤙🏿
Watching him is the reason why I got into F1. Haven’t missed a single race since
Did they put Daniel in a Orange tractor??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This should be OZ F1 GP on the dust road NOT bloody Melbourne!!!
F1 is weird without a DR
Makes me wanna go to Australia…
In some vehicles you need a radio for music in others the vehicle supplies the most beautiful music to one's ears, especially at redline...
Liam Lawson
a usual game of forza horizon 5
The crew2 vibes
Awesome seeing Ricardo you guys smashed it
love that orange tractor Daniel drive before he's on his f1 machine... and this year still an orange tractor...
Lo q han echo con Sergio Pérez visto en FORMULA UNO TOTAL de nuestro amigo DAVID de España nos a llevado a la determinación que más de 80MIL PERSONAS ya no consumamos sus bebidas y dejemos de seguir sus páginas, repudio total a la falta de ética que va contra el alma del deporte , un auto ingobernable para uno y otro para Max siempre lo mismo en todos estos años ya no lo vamos a aceptar ojalá esto cambie hoy saludos.
this makes me wanna cop skid machine and full send it now
It always puzzled me how soda pops can make so much money. They smell like laundry washing powder to me 😅
Wait they actually found some smooth aussie roads?! 😂
This video feels like a mission from The Crew 2
sabotage to Checo  in Australia by red bull !!!!
you guys are like Forza horizon in real life
Only RB team can do this
Oh Lord, has to be one of the coolest ads ever 😜🤙🇦🇺  Bravo Danny and guys 😎👌
Forza 5 vibes
Dani in an Orange Tractor 🤣
Awesome work from Hype Republic filming it
So anyone mention to Daniel that hitting a roo..as he knows..at Mach 1.2 has limited possibilities of survival?..this comment is for those that have never driven in the outback.
Hello
Just wish they would replace the grumpy guy with danny
Red Bull def has the most fun lol and damn, they sponsor every typenof racing on earth. Absolutely love these fun little videos. Good to see Riccardo back in Red Bull colours. You beauty!  🇦🇺 🪃
okay i fully expect this car, this driver, and this track to become incorporated into D.R.I.T.3
So gross seeing american junk racing around our tracks. Supercars should have kept racing Falcons and Commodores, not the american shit they're racing now 🤮.
Epic.. Red Bull and smiley!! Match made in heaven.  Good stuff, A solid “Hell Yea Brother” from your US homies..
Looks like Forza Horizon f1
Silverton not Broken Hill 🏎👍🏼
That was actually super rad
So Daniel was the one driving, say 10% of that video?
The stunts were cool but the acting was cringe AF!!!
That was brilliant! Well done
What in the Forza Horizon was that video
DAAANG THE RB7 OF DANNY
It's funny watching this knowing he wasn't in the country at the time of filming but was over in the states at Miami (for memory) because he was going to attempt to set a new record for a F1 car at the mountain
mount P A N O R A M A!  that place is so awesome! next to the Nurburgring a must do for me! Altho I think only one I can get upon
this man left f1 racing for this lmao. sad and funny . i wonder how much money they offerd him ?
Bro is riding wets on super dry
that shevy camaro at the end looked sick
Maaan just litsten to that sound!! Damn i miss it in F1
Loving these promo videos! RB has a serious fleet of awesome machines!
Forza 6 🔥
This feels so much like Forza
Sickk
hannah i love you <3
yeah the local 7/11 makin the vid!
Wow. What a creative way to have him on the team! Whoever came up with this idea really was in touch with social perception of him. Maybe he’ll still race again, but maybe this’ll stay his nitch!
Only thing I could think of watching this is John Pork Barilaro and the crazy recordings of his Pork Barreling confession. AND IM NOT EVEN FROM NSW (Hail from Canada lol)
Cool video, would love to see Daniel back in F1 in 2024.
Petition to add dirt courses to future F1 schedules.
beautiful.. the team could use an acting class tho
This is straight out of a forza horizon game
Big nod in style to the late great ken block!
Love it! Just the kind of fun this guy needs, so good to see the smile!  Danny Ric's mojo back in 3, 2, 1...
Beware of kangaroo on road...don't make road trip to roadkill...😂😂
Danny back home…
I see an orange tractor 👀👀👀🤣💀
Daniel is the show man😂 great to see u instead max bored 😅
yall didnt think we notice you made daniel drive an "orange" tractor, i wonder what reference that is
imagine gettin paid to do that and then gettin paid by mclaren to do nothing
official clown in f1
cool vid, its a pity that none of it was actually Ricciardo though, so its all fake really.
Cool video but I was hoping to see mod max in it.
Perfection 👍
This was cringe
0:21 Danny Ric driving an orange tractor…we see what you did there Red Bull 😬🤭😂  (saw original comment on fb)
I was a Chinese overseas student who studied in Oz back in 3 years ago, when I see the seacliff bridge in the video, it brought back my memories
What a legend. So happy to see Daniel smiling and advocating for the sport and RB after the last few years
Daniel still driving an orange tractor
👍👍👍 nice
All that money on catering and nothing left for acting coaches, aye.
What a great video! Danny Ric belongs with Red Bull
Stupid and pointless waste of time
No tire change every move from tarmac to gravel, that's the only one minus doesn't like old commerce that doing tire change in every move from tarmac to gravel
It's a shame that he has to wear a full face helmet - I wanna see that big grin!
Vielen Dank. Klasse Mal etwas hinter die Kulissen von Bernd zu blicken
Just needed highway patrol to defect the F1 car for being too low
Aussie Aussie Aussie
Sick helmet for a sick driver.
GO GO Daniel!
Awesome video yet again RB!! It would be a nice comic touch if the mechanics didn’t have the tires ready when he pitted. Monaco 2016 all over again 😂
That part with the helicopter was like a forza horizon mission haha
Daniel looks to me like the kind of person that always smiles on the outside but cries on the inside...
I love it but those interactions are so fake😂 and it's like they asked Daniël to crank up his accent 200%
Daniel can make a comeback alright! yeah buddy!!!
This looks like the trailer for a forza horizon 3 remaster
Who the hell put an F1 car. Off. Road? Dang
this new Forza Horizon traielr looks awesome!
Dan driving and orange +*cough Mclaren*+ tractor 🤣🤣🤣 RB Marketing guys are savage AF!! I really do hope Dan can get back on the grid.
Hmmmm so a Daniel Ricciardo road trip without Daniel..... lets be real he was only doing voiceovers and was on camera for a total of what 20 seconds?
What an awesome clip!  Daniel and Red Bull you guys are the best !!
That was great....
In future all F1 events require a dirt sprint as well as a hillclimb. Then qualify on bitumen!
Would love to see Dan in Bathurst, maybe he can try for this year as then it would be massive marketing and he still gets a drive for Redbull
The clown of F1 🤡
Dan the Man loved it glad he's back
Daniiieeeeelll!,  f#%king legend..  so are Toby Price, Daniel Sanders, Matt Hall and definitely  Gizzy.. props for this.
Fanboys in the comments...doesnt matter how much you suk up you're not getting a free t-shirt ok.
bring back v10
WE LOVE DANIEL RICCIARDO!
Its like the beginning of a Forza Horizon game haha
Red Bull out here doing Forza Horizon things r
**Cringe**
That's sick ay.
Waiting for the jiz to start asking for blue flags 😢
HOOOOONIN!!! get it, boys!!!
This is giving hoonigan went corporate and quit making good videos for me.
DANNYS BACK
Tourism Australia advert. 👍😁👍 Go you good thing.
The new V6’s sound so much better…said no one ever. There was a missed opportunity to use the last of the V8 interceptors, the RB9
Is it a coincidence that the tractor Danny drives in the beginning is a similar shade of orange as the McLaren? Subtle jab at their cars are slow as a tractor?
What a splendid way to waste fuel.
Ahhh the sound of the RB7 😍😍😍
Looks like forza horizon amazing
I think i just became 10% dumber for watching this… maybe its 15% I can’t tell… my brain cells took a hit. I think i will stop supporting Max and go to another team that doesn’t need to create content that is irrelevant to life.
i wonder if he went back to get the watch
I can't tell if everyone knows or nobody knows that danny ric wasn't driving the car... great video regardless!
Australia looks very dusty!
Damn this video. Daniel with the RB7 this is wild I can’t believe this 🔥 🔥🔥
Redbull.  How many Aussie/NZ racing legends can we get in one video 😅.   Yes!     Ngl Jamie was a nice touch
Outback straya mate
The old Red Bull in the dirt handles better than the current Mclaren
Ricciardo is the band aid on the failing Redbull PR team rep
Danny Rick back at RB is like ice cream and  chocolate sauce, apple pie and custard, heroin and spoons.... they just go together.
Danny Fucking Ricciardo!!
was that martin copping i saw
Look, this should have ended with him doing a shoey on the top of the Opera house... Melbourne would have been furious!
Did Daniel do a hot lap round the mountain. I think Jensen has the unofficial lap record there in a mclaren ????
Can you imagine any other team doing this, this is why I always been an RB fan, their fan engagement is second to none! That they have Max as their star driver now is a bonus
Loved this. Brought a smile to my dial.  Pay no heed to the comment whingers, they're just jealous and sad sacks.
I don’t understand why it all had to be so scripted.. was cringe af
At least he can still overtake a lorry ❤
Tourism Australia after spending $50M on some crappy campaign "hold my beer"
Please supply a translation for us Americans!😅
This is really living
We are going to watch very closely throughout the season that they do not continue cheating on Checo, they are a shitty team and everyone knows that.
Awesome. I remember when Matt Hall came to fly here in Adelaide for the Adelaide Motorsport Festival a few years ago. he was flying near-on in between tress and things, totally nuts and we loved it :)
I wonder if he payed for that can of redbull?
That must've been so fun to make
Insane production, so cool to see such a video completely for free😮
Hannah Schmitz
This is why I support RBR, always loved Red Bull as a marketing powerhouse from the soapbox races, Flugtag to the professional endeavours like F1, X-Fighters or even Felix Baumgartner's skydive. They're incredibly bold and just know how to pump people up!
*nicee ricardo*
The guy is an absolute legend. Well done RB for bringing him back on board in one way or another ❤
Forza horizon 6
Danni Ric just having a blast!!
Wow, that trip brought back some old memories and never expected to see Wolongong ever again after visiting that back in 1974. Thank you Red Bull
Can't wait to have Danny commentating for redbull and F1
This feels like a Forza Horizon mission
Australia seems dusty
How can you not love red bull when they do this for their fans?! Thank you red bull for investing in us.
As a non-Australian I can confirm this is all Australians do
¡We strongly request Daniel instead of Max, because so much arrogance is not necessary in the team!
Assembled a crack team 😂😂😂
WHERE IS BEHIND THE CHARGE?!!?!?!
Guys I love Danny I really do but this first 35 seconds is cringey af 😂
It doesn't sound SCRIPTED at all 😆
Its great to see him back
This video is basically garbage... Apart from the shots of the stunts the rest is very bad. Awful storyline, awful acting and awful concept overall... This seems more a video for very young kids than a cool racing video.
that's as corny and cringe worthy as it gets. who write this script? for a company who does so many cool things, the video editing is terrible.
This video was kinda cheesy but I’ll take it. We need more Danny content!!!
They really had to put him in an ORANGE Tractor didn't they 😂😂😂
Oh no the dust
I absolutely enjoyed this video.  What a Road Trip.  That RB7 was incredible 👏
I haven't liked one of these this much since the one you made where DC was chased off the back roads of that ranch in Austin.
Upload the full onboard lap of Mount Panorama in the RB7 PLEASE!!!!
Mount panorama would be a interesting choice for a modern f1 race as its not a wide track still would be good to watch
He doesnt seem to have the worst job there is.
Coolest thing I’ve ever seen
So funny seeing Danny drive an orange tractor (you know what team)
I think that proves that Danny can still drive pretty well xD
Yoo dannyyyy😭😭❤️
RedBull is the marketing goat amk
Cringeworthy and embarrassing. The lucky country truly has become the cringe country
This is basicly a Forza  Horizon 5 trailer.
This feels like a Forza Showcase Event. 😂
I gotta admit, smart move on Redbull to bring back Danny, his infectious personality is a marketers dream! Not to mention in return he gets a chance to re-center himself and get back to who he really is. Its a win win for both sides. I am not a fan of RedBull due to that BS against Mercedes but Danny literally makes me dislike them a lil less. :D Welcome back Boyooo!
Cringe
I've watched 30 times already 🏎️🇦🇺
This feels right like a top gear challenge
Get rid of Max
“Australia’s top racing experts”… SVG shows up anyway.
Like forza horizon
Not sure what you have to do to a F1 car to make it run on dirt roads, but well done!
Thank you for sharing this powerful and thought-provoking video. It's an important reminder of the challenges we face as a society and the need for compassion and understanding.
Only redbull would rally a F1 car
That was amusing.....
I hate to break it to you all but Danial wasn't the driver at Mt Panorama.
That was AWESOME! Can’t wait for this weekend!
Man I love Danny Ricciardo so much. I really hope he gets a chance to race in the RB19 at least once or maybe the RB20 full time... Really miss seeing this guy on the grid.
I’ve driven every road and track in NSW listed in this. Nice
Bad ass video
Drop bear!!!!!
Epic!
Love it 😂 awesome
Nice try Red bull, I almost liked you for a second there
Man I would never ever think Daniel would do this in a red bull🥲
3:38 Isn't that bridge in Forza Horizon 3?
Wtf is this bullshit lol.
Red bull should have invested in Australia’s largest dirt series and included speedway in this add but grass roots Motorsport isn’t this cringe
This looks like the Starting Race to a new Forza Horzion :D
car trying everything to stay on the road 😭😭😭
Lovely to see Daniel back wearing a redbull suite ❤ welcome back Mr. Daniel Smile
this looks like forza horizon gameplay lmao
I bet even Norris wishes he could’ve left McLaren now.
oh....love it.....just like forza horizon😉😛
Thankyou Redbull for signing Daniel Back!!!!!! brilliant video, and cannot wait to see more!
Nice! Who was the driver hidden under the helmet?
No other team has ever done epic videos like red bull does, amazing cinematography as always rb mediahouse!
is it RB10?
And the pundits said if he cant get an F1 drive Why The Hell would he become the RB Reserve Driver ... welll um For Fun and he's STILL getting paid to do it by McLaren   KEK
The screaming engine SOUND!
I may have to watch this again, just for that engine sound!  I'm surprised that they showed him driving the McLaren in the beginning....
Ride height? YES!!!
Inject this into my veins
Ricciardo is a treasure. Protect him at all cost
hell that was boring
Hello Cheaters !
I love seeing Hanna here
Red Bull are superbly good at racing F1 cars.  But they should definitely stick to that.
Bridge from forza horizon 3
Literally gave off Crew 2 vibes holy smokes
When you have money like Arab people... And you spend same way. 😢
Wow - its the real Australia...minus all the 'diversity' that has ruined it...
Not Danny driving a papaya tractor 💀💀💀💀
RB7 be screamin like hell
love it
Hats off to the Marketing Team, crazy one
Noooo not Daniel starting the video in this years McLaren😭
I personally believe that his career is over. The only reason he is around F1 is because he sells and has charisma, but performance wise, that is long gone. Failure after failure with Renault and McLaren speaks itself.
¿uʍop ǝpısdn oǝpıʌ ǝןoɥʍ ǝɥʇ sı ʎɥʍ
This is sooo amazing
Daniel livin' the videogame life 🎉😂
Sad to see DR relegated to doing promo vids for RB. He was once my favorite in F1.
Love this for Daniel!
Grass wasn’t greener on the other side. He had to return smh
This is so cheesy.  I love it.
The older cars look so much better
Always great to see Daniel behind the wheel of a RB F1 car! Welcome back, Dan!! Another fantastic video btw!! Loved it! 😎😎
🫶🏽
Forcing in the watch was cringe af but the rest was amazing
Danny Ric + Red Bull + RB07 = all is right in the world. Now he needs to be on the grid.  Food for thought: Daniel and Project 91 with Red Bull colors on a NASCAR at COTA next year. Makes Danny’s dream come true, and it would be nice to see the return of Team Red Bull in NASCAR even for one race.
Daniel ricciardo é o melhor
Ahh yes, Albert Park in inner-city Melbourne is notorious for having the same surface quality as outback Australia. Good thing they tested. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
sad to see danny become this attraction...
Something about seeing Danny in the red bull brings tears to my eyes
What a road trip!
Daniel starts making car vid content for a living in the year after Ken Block died. We’ll never see the collab, but at least DR can fill part of the hole 😅
All Danny did was a few lines and the tractor shot rest was stunt driver. Man’s getting bank to do nothing. I miss him though
“Keeping him relevant” Campaign
it feels like day 1 for me again. i got into Formula 1 because of Red Bull's video with Dan and Seb introducing the turbo hybrid changes for 2014. the cg was so fun to watch
Thank you guys for keeping Danny around, now you just need to send him back to the tarmac
That was the best promo ever. Period.
man i enjoyed that, great video
Rb are everywere. In the air, inroad, offroad, in the space.... damn!!!!
We love Daniel.  Txs to RB for briging him back!
Danny, please seek career counseling.. 🙏
that was barf-tastic, but dang that car sounds good
Danny Ric the new DC?
This was SOOOOOO Awesome!!!!  Wowza!  Loved seeing the RB7 at Bathurst!  Absolutely love these videos.  Thank You!
How sad is this. He’s now been relegated to filming promo videos instead of racing.
McLaren dollars hard at work over here 😂
Imagine how cool this video would be with a good F1 driver if Daniel can make it look this cool…
Those poor air intakes on that f1 car lol
So, the dude did a few cameos, the voice over and probably is watching this chilling with a few of the mclaren mill without stress. Dude did the best move of his career.  He will be back next year after checo wins the championship and verstappen rage quits.
Feels like a forza horizon dlc 😂 love it!
Feels like a forza horizon dlc 😂 love it!
am so happy to see daniel ricciardo again at red bull btw his helmet is fire
Honestly, would rather be doing this than racing with that pile of trash that is Mclaren
Daniel is the only good thing about Red Bull this year. Has more class than Horner and Verstappen combined
Sick
So little time so many ads lol
WHAT TEAM WILL CHECO BE IN NEXT YEAR?
this is like a forza cut scene
please upload in HDR : )
No dust particles were harmed during the making of this video 💯
You see, this is why Pirelli wouldn't let the f1 race happen in the rain, turns out they were actually off-road tires.
"Back in the shed, think it still running" WHERE DO YOU KEEP THE 30 MECHANICS DANIEL? WHERE DO YOU HIDE THEM ?
Lego games humor
Such a shame seeing so much amazing footage going to waste, why not make a cool edit instead of trying to make a funny children's show..?
🔥❤
Subtitles in Español , español para america latina.!!!
Bruv Van Gisbergen isnt an aussie
Ironically, the on the time sheets at 8:32 Daniel is still racing for McLaren 😆
Could you guys do that again please? It was over in a heartbeat!
Awesome concept, poorly executed in comparison to a Hoonigan Gymkhana video though...
Glad to see him in a RB back again Sad he didnt get a seat
This is why they pay him 18 million a year
Outstanding!!
Faster than taking the plane over
Seems like Australian tourism video more than f1 lol
Danny drove an orange tractor. Brilliant!!!!!
Name me an all-rounded sports freak company other than Red Bull I'll wait... coming from a Merc fan.
Better here than rotting with that shit McLaren car this year
Daniel in a papaya tractor is crazy 🤣
He never got back for the watch... 😞 LOL
👍👍👍
Daniel sitting in an orange tractor must be a slight dig at McLaren 😂😂😂 And I'm here for it!
About as cheesy as a cheeseburger, but I f***ing love cheeseburgers.
How to breach the budget cap with one marketing video
Forza Horizon 3. 5? 🤔
No way did they have Ricciardo driving an orange tractor in the beginning, nah thats a violation 😂😂😭
Hahahaha the visor wipe during the pitstop was the cherry on top
F1 car in my garage is better.
Best vid on you tube ever, that was epic
Was this a bid to have Mt. Panorama on the calendar?
Forza Horizon 6 looks great!
Redbull marketing: we fly planes, helicopters, we ride bikes, jump off buildings and bridges…  Ferrari marketing: our drivers are handsome 😂
Amazing video! Dan and team probably had more fun doing this than most ppl will ever have in their whole lives!
nice
Watch some Honda laptop civic drive past him hahahahah
I hope the people at the start are actually Red Bull employees and not professional actors because that was awful.
Wow this is amazing
That made absolutely no sense... & I'm from Aus...
Is this forza horizon because it sounds and looks like it.
Liam!!!!
Oh of course, Danny just has an RB7 in his shed like every Red Bull driver, right?
Masterpiece. We need Daniel back !!
Are Merc fans allowed here ?
Well that wasn't cheap...
Thank you Liam Lawson
Let’s go Dan, redbulls gotta stop firing and hiring my man, he’s the best athlete you guys have in motor sports
Love this! This stunt seem familiar though, I think it start with the letter “G”  and the driver was KNB.
The orange tractor made me laugh so hard i shat myself🤣🤣🤣
this guy gets paid to have fun, like a mini vacation
Pretty sad they had to fake Ricciardo driving in this video but hey I guess it work$ for red bull
As an Aussie, this is cringe and also legendary. I want to see Daniel back on the grid in a Red Bull!
Hahaha good bye mclaren! Zac well done!!
Imagine hitting a kangaroo
This was awesome! Danny belongs at RB but in a proper F1 seat! Sorry Checo, you need to go!😅
Why does this feel like a Forza Horizon ad
Inb4 Turn10 and Microsoft copyright strikes this video 😅
8:38 That Voice 🥺😍
Were they actually allowed to race one another on Mt Panaroma?
If only it was a Holden in the last race at the Mount, no bull-sh*t
Now give gizza a steer
Confirmed, Danny is the Australian stig!
Aussie Aussie Aussie
"You're the one who cracked the eggs" 😂
Dam Fine Video! Bet all the Fella’s had a Fat Time!Aussie Bloke!👍🍺!
Damn, that Forza Horizon 6 looks great.
Nice👌
Would of been nice if Danny was actually in the RB7
Redbull making an Australian tourism add
your gonna try tell me they cant have an F1 race at bathurst bullshit
Wekcome Back Daniel/ 'Karibu Tena Daniel' in Swahili
Show pony
So good - DANNI RIC, always puts a smile on your face.
Danny driving an orange tractor in the first scene seems "odd" don't you think? lol
Other F1 teams: Showcase their cars in glass displays Red Bull:
Daniel with the orange tractor 😂😂💀💀💀😭😭😭
God this is what Daniel was made for I feel. I've seen 5 sec and already on the floor. 😂
Miss Daniel Ricciardo, miss RB7, miss the sound!!!
heh was the F1 car stuck in 3rd gear at Bathurst ? 😅😅
Every thing but Svg and you all most had it
THEY GOT THE LOLLIPOP MAN 😂
So better than “ drive to survive”😂
Dope video,  Fire the script writer.  Just let the fellas yarn, keep it authentic.
I was at the mountain when this happened! SO COOL
Can we just all agree that Bathurts is waaAay more exiting than albert park.....😌👍🏽
So Liam Lawson was doing the Bathurst driving and I assume the wooloongong driving, who was doing rest or was it all Liam?! Very cool tho
Serious Gymkhana vibes
'Not another bridge video' I couldn't help but laugh. So many of our modern car ads use Seacliff.  Honestly, not far from the airport. Near Seacliff Bridge is 'Bald Hill', great place for a picnic. And the Mount Keira hiking tracks and the National Park nearby.  And Wollongong has some pristine beaches that honestly are better than 'Bondi' but with far less people.   If you're planning a trip to Sydney, highly recommend heading south to us for a visit.
Love the drop bear :) Yer mate love the humor.
Been awhile since I got goosebumps from a vid, great job Danny and Team!
This wasn’t it but I very much like the direction they’re going in
I feel like I’m witnessing a forza 5 challenge. And yet it’s so good
DANIEL RICCARDO- OVER RATED  OVER PAID  .
Danial back in the mclaren at the start of the video
Danny We love you. ❤❤❤
👍👍👍🍥🍙🍥🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭😱😱😱
Great to have the great man back in the paddock.
6:57 man checking an invisible watch. Red bull tech is ahead of the game
We need a saudi road trip 🙏
We all know RB7 is a production car.
Forza Horizon intro sequence IRL...😅
love it!!!! ❤❤❤
this is just F1 Gymkhana...I FUCKING LOVE IT
Wonderful video! Loved it ❤❤❤
Always new information 👏🏻🙏🏻
This is giving me Severe Forza Horizon vibes
daaang coulthard doesn't have a job now
I just want to remember you RedBull, that just because you got the nicest Race driver ever in your Team, we will not like you or Max more for that XD
this one goes hard 🥵🔥 more of this (with Daniel) please 😁🫶🏻
Love, Daniel.  It's awesome seeing him back at Redbull!!!
Looks like he’s having a blast. Good to see him happy
The fuel tank must be like a Tardis to cross those sorts of distances.   Bigger on the inside.
this some Forza Horizon type stuff
All terrain tires on an F1 car look sick
When the real OGs know it’s Liam Lawson driving…
We need more Danny Ricc!
Cool video!
The story of ricciardo surely is the most modern take on the Ancient Greek tragedy
Oh that's crazy at F1 car at Bathurst.
Brilliant
Red Bull  как всегда , радуют своими задумками и видео рядом, супер !
trop coool Daniel !!!!
McLaren paid dan 20 million for this ad lol
Love Danny Ric, but tbh if Piastri beats Lando this season, then Red Bull should grab him for 2025
My god, the sounds. ❤❤❤
I miss seeing Daniel racing 😢
Sooo nobody else thinks the script is totally cringe??
woah, this is so cool. i hope someday F1 will use Mount panorama again in the future, just for fun you know... hahahaa
Oh, Big Brain Hannah! <3
who actually driving thoo
Danny Ric isn’t even driving…. You’ve got two Kiwi Redbull drivers at Bathurst… C’mon Redbull!
Danny Ric name on the car was legit painful. I really wish he could get back on the grid.
They made a dancing fool out of Daniel. But hey, a check is a check and I have to respect that.
SO GOOD... just all the feels!
That’s my dog! Her names Roxy and the start was recorded at my farm
This is like a whole Forza Horizon game in a video.
From one of the greatest drivers on the grid to the biggest PR clown on the grid. Every F1 driver past, present or future has a moment in theire career where they lose all theire hope, credibility, respect and confidence. THIS is that point for Ricciardo. This is NOT the beginning of the end for him this is the middle of the end.
Like Forza this
Well done Hype Republic on such a sick video
McLaren fan here, so happy to see him in Red Bull colours ❤️💙 wish him the best in the whole world, love u Danny
i think this was a good move for Ricardo - also Toby is an f$ckn legend - was hoping he would get airborne ❤
Shit that was cool
Show pony
1M views in a day? Only Danny Ric and RB can relate :)
For Some reason I Doubt Dani was in that car at all
so cool
Hate to know how much they spent on making this, cool video but hate to know how much it cost and still doesn't beat the guy that took his F40 drifting in the dirt.....Also reminds me of the supercheap Ads could be way cooler but prefer show
Love Daniel!! ❤
Bro will do better thing than racing formula 1 🥶🥶
The plane over the bridge in slow Mo looked epic 🙌
This video with 1 million views views after 1 day..... only other video with similar viewing is the welcome back Daniel video haha. Everyone loves a larrikin!
Something just feels right about seeing DR in the RB suit
preddiction for next year! After a season of sparks between Verstappen and Checo, with few small incidents here and there, RedBull will decide to not extend Checo's contract. Instead, they wil give Daniel the car, as secondary driver, considering his previous performances outside RedBull. And within the RedBull spirit, Daniel will florish again, and produce some very nice drives, winning few races here and there, and help Verstappen to a new championship. You've heard it here first chaps!
Daniel is the most loveable driver  ❤
2019 Stop Being Them, 2023 Yes (i'm back)
I always forget that Red Bull is actually a drink, and not just a racing team lmao
What bike is that?
How many time the Mitsubishi engine blow off between shots?!
hope danny can get back on the grid asap
You beauty ❤
You know Daniel may not have got a title(yet?) But he got huge payday from renault and mclaren then 18mill to not drive mclarens horrible car. I hope he is just enjoying it. Back at Red Bull having fun getting paid and just chilling. Hope he enjoys it wheter he drives in f1 again or not
Does this mean Danny is driving this weekend?
Red Bull always delivers with these videos, this one specifically gave me Xbox Forza Horizon vibes. Red Bull should partner with Microsoft for a DLC package for the video game.
So glad to see Daniel back at RB - good on ya
Acting is a bit cheesy, but great video
So how many RB7 were made 🤣
Am I reading between the lines or is it funny how he started in a slow orange tractor and cuts to the RB7 lol
Good luck, Mate 👍
If he just would have stuck with red bull from the start. Never listen to your ego it  will always put you on the wrong path.
That was painful to watch
7:06 how much did Toto payed you for this AMG commercial
God that engine sounds so much better than what they have now..... Damn shame they don't have that sound
Lol how much of that did Ricciardo actually do tho ?
I know the acting isn't the main thing but Jesus at least put some effort into it. The intro sequence is so bad from everyone unanimously.
Living his best life - genuinely happy for the bloke after the debacle that is McLaren
With Ken Block gone, looks like Red Bull is trying to capitalize on that fame.
Nice to se daniel sanders, ricardo and toby in the same video! My favorite Aussies! Love from the netherlands🇦🇺🇳🇱🤘
Thins Danny Ric helmet looks fire, love to see Danny back at the road!!
Dialogs written by ChatGPT
This man is such a great poster boy for F1... has there ever been a more likable and positive driver in F1? RB was smart to welcome him back, although I don't see him getting that seat from Perez if Checo keeps performing like he does. But I do hope he's going to get another chance... maybe papa Stroll will wake up and realize his son isn't going to win him any championships, Ricciardo and Alonso could make a great team!
Did he put in a proper lap time at Bathurst??
come back Danial
i love red bull
Can't believe they got to use his McLaren at the start of the video
It’s like a Forza horizon 3 showcase event 😂
Marketing making the owners soul proud, RIP what a bunch of mad men you're bulls
I hope they can let him run in the gtan prize of Australia. Even if it is some practice of the free
Daniel is more charismatic  than the two main RED BULL drivers.
Surely the fact he's driving an orange tractor at the start of that call is a shot at McLaren?
Lol at Danny driving a papaya orange tractor 😂   What a great dig at McLaren. Touche Red Bull!
A thing of beauty. I loved the cleverness of the pause for breath/Tag Heuer shop watch moment, "Is that the time?". It felt like such an authentic Danny Ric moment. That's the kind of product placement I'm happy to see.
im surprised they let daniel drive his mclaren in the beginning of the video
The orange tractor 💀🚜 Ever so suttle nod to mxlaren
Forza Horizon called. They want their creative director back 😂
The Tractor tho 💀
Love it
Did you get inspiration from Forza Horizon?
Loved it. I once had a fever dream that went exactly like this
Really, really cool video !!  🔊🏁🇦🇺 Good, old, loud SOUND & great racing action "in the Outback"!
First reserve driver to go viral
No Jack Miller? literal australian redbull rider??
cool to see an F1 car in the dirt
That helmet wipe 😌🤌🏻
I wish they still made good sounding cars
Seeing Forza Horizon in live😆😆😆
Redbull gladly taking Ricciardo back as a “reserve driver” just to harness his lovable personality for marketing
Yeah, this would have been a great video if it was actually Daniel driving.
Daniel has it covered. Everyone is trying to get a seat in the (sorry to say this) shitty hybrid turbo cars. Daniel is just having fun in the V8!
this is stupid but I love it
Well done red bull, massive W. 👏
Clicked immediately
Best regards 15 years enggering Adrian neway
What are they is scam with triple dra copy me this Ian.t legal
Daniel really is the ultimate F1 personality. He gets as many views in a day that the most popular F1 videos get in a week or more. So glad to see him back having fun hooning around where we all know he belongs, back in the Red Bull family!
At least Danny still gets to do a bunch of fun stuff.
Acting is not their strong point is it? 🤣  Cool video anyway.. 👍🤘
no mention of the part where liam lawson was driving...
😂😂😂 Danieeeeeelllll Ricaaaaaarrrrdooooooooo 0:22
I swear Redbull arguably has the best marketing of all time. Never a bad time watching these masterpieces.
That’s not Danny ric driving the car…
They really had Daniel driving an orange tractor lmaooo
Give him some FP's at least, ffs.
they could have done this for their car launch and not the snooze fest the did....
This is like a forza expedition race
Great to see Danny Ric back !!!
I Love the subtle jab at Mclaren at 0:21🤣 (Orange tractor for anyone who does not get it)
F cars on Dirt NEEDS to be a thing
Ain’t no way they put Danny in an orange tractor 💀
Forza Horizon Red Bull DLC looks sick!
What in the Forsa Horizon is going on here?
When Sanders flew in that was wicked
Yeahhh 👑👑👑🔥🔥🔥
looks like Daniel is having  fun!!!!!
I feel déjà-vu seeing Danny drive an orange tractor
Wonder if he met the bondi team while they were there
The fact that in 24hrs time this clip has received almost 1M views - shows WE NEED DANIAL aka BADGER back in F1!
Awesome Danny Ric 😎 G Day
3:08 I haven't seen "Lollipop Man" in a long time 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Daniel sanders & Toby price "offroad racer"?? Come on redbull.. Dakar sensation.. Recognition..
DANNYYYYYY
Well if this isnt living the dream i dont know what is. Dayem.
THE ORANGE TRACTOR LMFAO
Welcome back Dani.
Bathurst. V8 Supercar. V8 F1 car. This was the highlight. ❤🇦🇺
Welcome, to horizon 6!
Is that an orange tractor?
GG Daniel!!!
You know that fulfilled a lifelong dream to drive full tilt around mount panorama.
We love Daniel Ricciardo.
0:21 Daniel driving a orange tractor was peak comedy bro. 😂
They signed daniel to be a content creator, hes pretty much F1elly now lol
The next Forza Horizon is looking 🔥 🔥 🔥
Yeet yeet!!!!
Better this than a real race, no doubt🤣
Sure beats an E-scooter and a Heineken 0.0, eh Danny?
Danny already looks so much happier than he was at McLaren. Although I’m sad he did not get a seat, I’m so glad he’s more respected where he is.
Seeing Dany back is an amazing feeling 😅
DR3
Heck ya, nice way to start race week!
Danny in Orange Tractor 😂😂 0:22
He's having fun again 🥳🥳🥳🥳😁
forza horizon
Woahhh that was epic, well done guys!
We need more of this🙌
Spiders and snakes hate him for this one simple trick
Poor old RB cars, the life is not easy after retirement.
It's a bit sad to see Danny Ric back at Red Bull only to be assigned to the marketing department.
More stuff like this please. Daniel is the perfect brand ambassador for RB.
Me as a Mercedes fan a Ithink. Have to say. This is marketing at his finest. Such a Great Video.. and Riccardo 😢 my biggest respect here. Good job redbull ❤️
that papaya tractor supposed to be McLaren?🤣🤣🤣🤣
It is so great to have Daniel back. So happy to see him at RB. I miss those times back when he was Max teammate.
they've got bro doing side quests
Watch the number 3 in the Redbull car warm my heart. Also is good to see Hanna as main caracter in this video.🎉
Anybody else feel like Danny is right where he belongs? Just making awesome content and enjoying life.
Looks like somebody found a fun job.
Wollongong represent!
Please tell me that orange traktor was a dig at Dan's former employer... xD
Danny Ric - from F1 driver to promotional mascot
Ace, loved it.
You know for the last 9 years I've supported and once respected the McLaren F1 team, however as I am a fan of DR3, I cannot feel they are disgraced, and unworthy of my respect for treating Daniel the way they had, all the while the PR team deflected and denied allegations of replacement. Glad he's back at RedBull, although without a seat for now, I am glad that he far far away from McLaren. Looking forward for more ORBR!
Is this aimed at 5yo's?
Yep, they knew what they were investing In.
Welcome back Daniel and I'm loving that new helmet!
Has f1 got air filters?
The legend!
this is definitely the craziest most expensive video
Although Hannah's acting skils are not yet on the same level as her strategic skills, it's nice to see her in this impressive video! 😀
Really do miss the sound of the old screamibg V12s. Legendary.
I’d love to see him racing on the track with Red Bull. Would just be the best energy. Aeesome vid.
Great to see Daniel back with RB.
Do you want some cheese with your Red Bull acting , 😂
Wollongon lol, I'm growing the wollongon strain of 🍄 right now ! I had no idea were they were from, lol.
Incrível Daniel
Just like f1 games just for kids
We need this guy in F1!!!!!!!!!!
This should have awesome but you made it chessey as
Is there another company in the world that’s going to do a video this good ? When that F1 car bolted out of that shed I thought we were in for something special and it didn’t disappoint . Totally cornball in places but that added to it , if anything
it is great to have Danny back at RBR!
I wish we could make Mt Panorama safe enough to hold an F1 race. Would be fricking awesome
So this is why Red Bull got Danny Ric as a reserve. Because Max and Checo are as charismatic as 2 potato salads.
Hmm. It's a great entertaining video, but there is a distinct whiff of fish about it. The Bathurst footage definitely appears to be from when Liam Lawson, not Daniel drove the RB7 at the Bathurst endurance race, so I do have to wonder how much of the footage is actually Dan behind the wheel.
Dudes living a video game life. If they made this game I’d play that it
The pit box team playing cricket🤣🤣
The camera work in this is fantastic!
Epic👍🏻
I always love the acting in these videos😂
Back where he belongs. Legend.
@redbullracing when can we get our boy Daniel doing a hot lap around the Mount panorama???? Let him send it for us Aussie’s 🇦🇺🦘
Awesome video, some real Forza Horizon vibes + Danny Ric!
PUT HIM IN FP1 PLEASEEE
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤜🏻🤛🏻
Great to see DR at his home country. 💖💖
Very well done
So they got Daniel back for social media content
Welcome back Danny!! Absolute legend, awesome video even if it wasn't Danny driving it. The Bathurst part was awesome, far out I wish F1 was brought to Bathurst as a regular circuit.
why halo is removed from daniel's car
what a video, thank you! see you there!!
Give this man a car!
F1 definetly needs a dirt track, i am not even joking.
But off road is wild 🎉🎉🎉
Red bull feels like it's ran by a 5 year old that's also a billionaire, I'm all for it
Awesome way to have Jamie in there. His time with RBR and 888 meant so much to motorsports.
This is like real life Forza Horizon but with F1
Yeahh.. welcome back Daniel!!!
Very cool guys, thanks for the video
This reminds me of Forza Horizon
more of these
I'm still hoping he takes the opportunity to co-drive for an enduro in Supercars. He drove Rick Kelly's Nissan Altima during an off season and Rick said he was so intuitive he  was correcting steering mistakes before the car gave any feedback.
This is so Hoonigan and Ken Block inspired
Hahaha je l'attendais tellement !
Why would you give Daniel a podium? The guy is just a second choice.
Danny still getting some race time B-) it's cool seeing a track I've raced on Gran Turismo 7 in real life, it looks exactly the same and I remember the turns :D
Mount Panorama in Bathurst was freakin awesome
Legend Daniel , Australia luvs ya mate❤💪👌⭐ incredibly put together red bull, get Daniel racing again 🙏🥊🥊
I mean. It's cringe, but it's high production value and Dani Ric, so I'm choosing to ignore that.
R.D. still behind the scenes. Without Roland, there is no racing!
Riccardo should never have left RedBull.
Would love to see an F1 race one day at Mount Panorama Circuit.  Always challenging when I've raced it in Gran Turismo online and I bet the F1 drivers would love it.
If you weren’t a Red Bull or Riccardo fan, you should be now.  I’d love to see the making of this clip
awesome to see Gizzy at the end!
I love you Redbull!
Who's gon clean those airways?💀
from superstar to sidekick... fate has not been kind, but we all love you Daniel
Pretty friggen cool. Wish I would have know about the Seacliff Bridge stunt. Should have gone to The Compound  or Mundi Mundi l Lookout ( Mad Max Location)
Amazing!!
Its not even DR driving 😤
Good but where is Jack Miller?
Wow that was boring to say the least...riciardo isnt a personality, hes actualy realy bland and boring. 75% of the video is filler at best. The video they did in the dirt at texas was way better. This is just re-hashed stunts from old videos.
So much effort put into these videos by Red Bull.  Very impressive
0:22 back driving the McLaren
You legends! So good to see Danny back!
Hate this team with everything I have but this is some legendary stuff. Tom Cruise move over, we have Danny Ric in the house!
Welcome home.
Imagine having a real F1 race on Mt Panorama through that downhill chicaney bit
This video is missing Jack Miller
Just need a F1 or redbull combined gymhkana!!
Funny how the drivers can somewhat act but the team can not.
Redbull finally got themselves a full time clown. Good job 👏
So Liam Lawson is the Stunt Driver for Daniel Ricciardo? Nice to know 😁
I need him back racing right NOW
That tank kept on crepin
this made me smile
Meanwhile, at McLaren, people are getting depressed and Danny is having the time of his life.
He’s finally working. Where was he in Croatia? Where was he in Bathurst?
So9sad seeing DR doing such stunt drives instead of racing 😢
It was like he never left
great vid Red Bull.....
Daniel will be driving on practice 1 on Friday..
Bit cringy, but the shots are great. Nice to see Danny in an F1 car
But the fact was, Liam Lawson drove the car. Daniel was in the US at that recording.
Amazing as always 😮❤
at last, someone gave SVG a flogging
Bono my tyres are gone , shoot wrong channel
cringe.
The amount of effort redbull always puts into those videos is not talked enough about❤
This made me happy
Damn thats kinda enginesound
Daniel driving an orange tractor at the beginning is quite the dig!
That was an amazing video well done to all especially Danny Ric its good to see you back home again.
Daniel is the man! Such an easy-going and charismatic lad. We all love him, and he brings revenue to any organisation he works in
man who doesn’t love danny ric
Good to see dr is actually still being acknowledged and not just lost as a reserve driver
why does this video foreshadow forza horizon?
Don't wanna be a party pooper but that wasn't danny, it was Liam Lawson. Search it up.
Except it's Liam Lawson driving.
Sorry but cringy AF.
The intro feels like a Forza mission
This was fantastic Red Bull.
he deserve better.. best of wishes for Daniel... keep going.. hope see you soon on the tracks with a competitive car...
“Cracked the eggs” iykyk
Daniel !!!
But why?
🤙💪🇦🇺🥰
And yet in 90% of the shots in the car Daniel is not in it.... :(
interesante
What a ride! Thanks, Honey-badger 🤙🏼
Looks like just a bit more Fun than an F1 seat. You're the man Daniel. I look forward to more of this and your arse back in F1 someday. If no F1. Bring more f this shit on.....
Checo Pérez & Daniel Ricciardos 🤞🏻😈🤞🏻
It looks like Mexico from Breaking Bad
FANTASTIC  WELL PUT TOGETHER
F1 for sale ... somewhat stuffed, lol
wheres jack miller?
Gotta love them saying “Australias top racing experts” when Shane Van Gisbergen is a kiwi 🇳🇿
good to see Danny back in his old car
Let's go Ricciardo Daniel's ✌️
this feels like a forza horizon game
Daniels way of driving an f1 car, take it to the countryside. 👍👍👍
Amusing how they make it look like the formula 1 car can just start up. It needs to be warmed up before it can be started, at ambient temps the cylinders are locked. But still pretty cool looking. Though theres no way they drove it across the country like that.
Nice edit! That’s not DR driving at Bathurst though! 🧐
I really hope he get to race at least once this season. Would love to see how he perform in an actual good car…
Red bull really used an F1 car for off roading
Thank god RedBull are not in the movie biz, that opening was cringe af. Its nice to hear the roar of the car though
Sounds and feels just like forza horizon in the best way
Wait. Danny boy isn't flipping burgers in fremantle??
I missed Danny at red bull I’m happy he’s back at the team
Great package from the team at Red Bull. None else can have fun like this!!
Max out Daniel in😊
Svg is a kiwi 💀💀
I like turtles.
Danny Ric but it’s actually Liam Lawson driving 😂
It’s great to see Daniel back with red bull🇦🇺🦘
Epic form of AAA advertising Red Bull. You worked in your various motorsport icons from down under, the Australian tourism angle, Tag H. timepieces, your energy drink, and 7-11. I loved every minute of it and I want to see more as the season progresses!
That was Amazing.. everybody Loves Daniel Ricardo.. Great work Redbull bringing him back..
Red Bull at its finest
Danny just can't escape driving orange colored tractors
While Max may be the best on the grid, Daniel is the best in our hearts
For a moment I thought I was watching an episode of Ken Block’s Gymkhana.
Which cattle station in the NT was that filmed?
Danny Ric...  Driving an orange tractor.  *Subtle.*
That  F1 engine sound is much better than today’s F1 engine sound.
Seeing Daniel just brings a smile to my face! Missy you DR
Nahhhh 😂😂 Daniels now is dreaming 🎉😂
that AMG cameo 😆😆😆😆
Tourism Australia owes you a 🍺 beer. 🎉🎉
Ok, so are we all on the same page that Daniel didn't do any of the driving in these scenes?
Forza Horizon feelings anyone?
It really does suck not having Danni ricc on the grid...hope he does come back next year but I'm still happy to see that McClaren are suffering without him
Wonder how many engines they went through 😂 also abit on the gringy side
From a Merc fan, nice to see Danny back to RB, also I would love my team doing this kind of things
love that track
FIA- "these are tires for wet conditions" Redbull- "you mean offloading right"
Doin’ donuts in da outback.
It's feels like a video out of Forza Horizon 5 came to life 🔥
Q 007 vibes
Every other constructor* this is our prized championship winning car, it belongs in a museum.  Redbull* let's thrash this shit in the outback mate! I heard vetty won a championship innit
Can we please have a Daniel Roadtrip series? Oh my gosh what legends
cringe,  Sydney Clichés and the rest of AUS is a dustbowl
Gokil emang humas Red Bull ini
Smiled like Danny Ric for every second of that!! It's great to see him back at Redbull even if it's not in a racing seat just yet
We love you Dany!!!
Everyone here for DR, well I'm here for Hannah.
Forza horizon events in real life Good job Red Bull 😘
Man that's Sebs car
The RB7 was so ugly but the sound makes up for it.
Love ya Daniel!
Always feel like I'm playing Forza Horizons when I see a commercial like this.
This was more entertaining than watching an actual F1 race.
I am so happy to see Danny in an F1 car. Danny you deserve a seat mate. I know you still have it in you. Hopefully, you get back to racing in f1 soon.
I'm happy that Daniel Riccardo found a job as a clown for the traveling circus. Seems like the perfect gig for him; I always remember how laughable his driving was. Just goes to show you, you don't have to be talented to find your dream job.
This is sick! Absolutely bet he is loving getting paid to drive to drive this little nimble car, with a decent motor sound again and no halo!   He is still doing more promotion for the AUS GP and not even on the grid. We Love ya DR still tied with piastri and Lando!! Keep it up
Such an awesome video…no one like Danny Ric and no place like Oz! 😊
love how he's just being a goofy guy for the red bull promo stuff looks like he's having fun
The undisputed champion of 2023
never thought id see the day of F1 racing at mount panorama.
This was really dumb, but really entertaining.
BLOODY LOVE DANIEL BACK!!!!!
karma hitting mclaren big time
See ya down unda!!! Let’s go kick some ass!!! Checo 1st, Max 2nd, Fernando 3rd.  🇳🇱 🇲🇽 🇪🇸
Good to see you again mate!
Wish I could have the money to take a f1 car down sea cliff bridge
i wanna see dan flog it around bathurst on a timed lap in an F1 car some time
What can I say 'Australia at its Best' thanks to Dan, Well Done Mate!!
Wow didnt expect DR to be riding the MCL36 0:21
Great video but I was thinking that poor F1 car on the dirt!! Also they need to change the titles of the other guys, Toby Price "off road legend" , Daniel Sanders 'Dakar legend" Shane Van Gisbergen supercar champion.
Nice Promo!
Ain’t no way they actually painted the tractor in mclaren colors
0:21 good reference of daniel testing the 2023 McLaren
What percentage of this was actually Liam Lawson driving? Given he was driving the RB7 during show runs at Bathurst. Easy to just chuck a helmet on anyone they like really.
Who votes we have the Australian GP at mount panorama 1 year!!👍 That would be epic!!!!
Danny Ric, let's go!
Wena daniel
Red bull esta a otro nivel, increíble video. bien por Daniel, lugar donde nunca se tendría que a ver ido!!!
The person on the sea cliff bridge walk
☮️🇨🇦
That orange tractor resembles… nvm
Ricciardo being farmer is the most on brand ricciardo ever
AKA Liam Lawson's Great Aussie Road Trip
red bull in clutch again
crew 3
Great show and this looks great !! 😍😍🤍🤍✌️❤️❤️🧡🧡💛💛✌️
Go you good thing 🖖
Hmmm .. seems that DR was there only in the digital sense, and young Kiwi Lawson did the job .. bit of fun, but misleading much?
Love it. If only F1 cars still screamed like that 😭
How much fun would that have been to do! Great to see Danny Ric with a smile on his face.
Just when I thought this loser was gone for good…
of course Redbull comes in with another sick video, they never miss. best marketing/advertising as always but they thickened the accents hard and threw in every slang word possible 🤣
I feel like i just watched a forza horizon intro but i love it
all of these clips arent even ric they are all Liam lawson
Alternate Title: "Daniel Ricciardo plays Forza Horizon 3 in the Red Bull RB7"
can't wait too see a max and danny ric video just like to old days
Dude in the truck was getting pelted by rocks and dirt. Crazy. Lmao
Daniel has the best job in Formula One
Does anybody actually think that Daniel Riccardo driving around Australia. Never took off helmet, dark visor. He did voiceover, and short clip, the rest somebody else.
That poor million dollar car
I wanted a Monaco throwback were they didn't have his tires ready
Thank you for more Danny Ric
WoOOOOOOoooooOOO !!! Best ONE EVVVVVVVVEERRRR
This gave me goosebumps
what is this hahaha
Who was really driving car? Nobody believes Daniel Ricciardo go acrros Australia without taking helmet off with dark visor & no banter banter or smiles. Downvote prove its real.
Shame Max Verstappen was Danny Rics stunt double.
Had fun with the ham, very well shot.
Was danny under the helmet tho??
Did Daniel even set foot in australia? this has to be Liam Lawson in every driving scene
SHEEESHHHHH LETS GO DANIELL
I don't know who the F.... all this idea to make this videos is but it really give me more love and passion for F1 ,RED BULL from 0 to 100 As fast as you can , from their history in F1 to their car now lol   very happy to see Daniel back and i miss Kimi a lot .
You know Daniel did none of this right
1:30 - "Hooley Dooley". Love it! I'm gonna use that.
🎉🎉
So cool
Hoping to see the Lawrence brothers
Yeah Dani Avocado! Welcome back!
Fantastic 👏👏👏👏
I wonder if they pulled that sleeping F1 car from the WA Motor Museum, would be awesome if it is the same one.
Awesome video, great Driving by Liam Lawson, would have been great to actually see DR driving the car.....
Cool, he's getting paid for not driving a McLaren.
Brilliant
Once again, Red Bull keep delivering the best digital marketing campaigns with such cinematic flare. It's simply amazing and entertaining to watch.
Seeing this warms my heart! Even as a Ferrari fan.
I’d rather see Danny Ric in these videos instead of Verstappen or Perez. Can I say he’s my favorite Red Bull driver???
This video was heavily inspired by Forza Horizon - love it.
DM is smiling from heaven.
Checo Pérez tiene que hacer el video de Las Vegas porque hay mucha raza mexicana y latina para el video de Red Bull Viva México
Me da gusto ver a Daniel Ricardo regresando a Red Bull
Espero el video de Las Vegas cuando sea la carrera el premio de Las Vegas el video que va a ser Red Bull
Red Bull made a very smart move and Daniel will do wonders for their brand even when he is not behind the wheel he is so popular.  Well done guys and this video is brilliant stuff!!
oh that car sounds sooo good!
RedBull really made a genius move bringing back Daniel even if he is just used for good PR lol. They know the fans will be here
More sound of that beast please
Meh
Red bull the best crew in the world ❤🤟😎
That was fun! Love Danny Ric!
I can totally see this becoming Forza Horizon 6
Brilliant & welcome back Daniel.............. and team
Preparing for the upcoming race by having the wrong driver driving the wrong car.
I’m not crying, you are !!😢😢😢 welcome back, Danny!!!! ❤❤
What man, what a team , Dany Ric good to see you back home. All my memorabilia is current again 😁 . RB is your home  hope to see you racing again.
Daniel racing in this year's Bathurst confirmed.
A shame. Any other team this would have been charming. Cheating can't be airbrushed out by rehiring a nice guy.
What a video
One slight problem.... Shane Van Giesbergen is Kiwi, not Aussie :P
The fact that Danny ric isn’t on the grid is a crime against humanity
Forza horizon 6？
"acting"
Danny Ric did a great job with all the voice overs in this ad.
F1 to mount panorama we need it
Welcome back RBR and Danny Ric you have been missed with great content!!
glad to see him back!  ill love to see him do an race this season!
we all missed daniel
Forza Horizon by Red Bull
This is just irl Forza Horizon and I absolutely love it
Simply lovely!
Awesome.
Car sounds SEXY!!
Red bulls so far ahead they can do this mid season
Bro this could be a forza ad lol  (Ive always wanted an F1 car and an actual track to race on in forza, an F1 or at least RB partnership would be dope)
Very nice, might as well get him doing something now his F1 career is over.
Seeing an F1 car tear up Mount Panorama was awesome! How legendary would a full race there be????
I've been subscribed to the RB racing channels for a few years now, this is the 1st time i actually watched a video, good job at rehiring Daniel, dont waste his talent please.
This brought me so much joy 😊
Looks like FORZA HORIZON MISSION
I am in love with Danny Ric's helmet!
oh, it just feels so nice to see danny ric again!
If you didn't enjoy that there's something wrong with ya.
Yeah the bit with the plane was amazing!
This watches like a weird indie game
Australia is pacifc Texas.
No one can compare to Red Bull simply they are the best in the world the stuff they do It's unbelievable, keep it up
Nothing beats more fun than having Daniel behind the wheel.  F1 best driver personality.
This is nuts
I wish Danny Ric was actually driving the car rather than Liam but understand logistics
Forza Horizon Red Bull DLC confirmed.
Orange tractor, hmmmm
🙂
Strayaaaaaaa..... mates..Fair dinkum epic❤
It's so good to see Danny Boy back with RedBull, doing fun videos like this, and being there ready to step in and race.  He's just an overall good guy to have around.
Absolutely love seeing Hannah getting some screentime!
The man is having too much fun
aint no way they put Daniel in an orange tractor 💀
jaja buenísimo me encantó el video de Daniel R.
What we now is an F1 race at Mt Panorama
This is so awesome, thanks RB and Danny!
Great ad but sad to see DR has become a full time mascot
Love the 7/11 Honda shout out rip the goat
As a Mercedes fan, this content is hype af, Daniel always bring me a smile.
Can't get enough of the car around Mount Panorama
Hannah ❤
Hannah my queen 👑
Songs in the Video?
This is why red bull is the best team
That was FOC  🇦🇺
danny ric is back. THANK YOUUUU
who here thinks that was a stunt driver and not actually the honey badger. show me proof!🤨
Greeeat to see Daniel in this suit!!!
forza horizon 3 irl
Signing daniel back was the best choice next to signing verstappen and checo🔥
I might be feral for this video
HANNAAAAH!! <3!
This is awesome
making these kinds of videos should just be DR's full time job
2023 Redbull is basically Heat in 2012 or Warriors in 2017 hell 90s Yankees, 83 Sixers 90s bulls smh they loaded everywhere
Fantastic!
Daniel Ricardo is the fuggin man
100% DR drove that f1 car across the country with just 1 tank of fuel
Imagine if the Australian grand prix moved to the outback🤠
We love Daniel🔥 but he needs a seat this season. Max or Checo should win the championship early and then Dani should show his pace
The high rake design is good for offroading!
Put him on the track!
i love that he switched to a schuberth
Good to see Mr. Smiley back in a car.
This new Forza horizon Red Bull racing edition dlc looks great
Now this is Podracing
THIS WAS INSANELY DONE
So good to get some big D again! 🇦🇺
Hope Danny didn't have to do a track walk🤣🤣
A deep per stage BTS on this would be epic. Legend if RB keeps the car extra dirty and on display at the Grand Prix…
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
Good stuff
I had to look up what a drop bear was 😂. I was like Koala’s are not bears 😂 that’s a funny thing.
Where was this crew when monaco happened?
Danny Ric and Red Bull have done more for Aussie Tourism in 8 minutes the Tourism Australia have done in 20 years
What a great video!!
Awesome, great seeing it in the Illawarra my hometown ❤
Yup Danny boy 👌💨💨
Get it @DanielRicardo Wild west Style
Awesome to see the RB at the Bathurst track, which opens up a debate on an F1 race at Bathurst.  Considering that the F1 drivers come a long way down under, why not have a second F1 race for Australia at Bathurst as a double header, it would be an awesome addition to the F1 calendar and I am sure it would get the thumbs up from the drivers.
If the hybrid F1 cars only sounded this good...
Who wants to be a F1 driver when you can be Danny Ricc
Why not use the vacuums? They're supposed to be nice and liberal.
But was that not Liam Lawson at Bathurst?!?!
F1 offroad bruhh i think red bull play Forza to much 😂
Is this Forza Horizon?
I love it
Straya!
Yall said Australian drivers, Shane is from nz!
forza horizon 5 irl
Aussies do it best 👌 and one kiwi🤘🤘
That bathurst made me think of the 1000plus hp skyline getting wrestled there =D
Daang! One of the bestcountry tours! Good to have DannyRic back in the team!👊🏻
poor pistons =D
Mm, welcome back to that engine symphony 😌
the new Coulthard? =D
fmd how did i miss this it was 20 mins from my house
I wonder if Liam Lawson got any of the driving credits?
So happy to have Danny back 😢❤
Its good to see Daniel happy. Also Australia really looks like beautiful place.
The 'hooly dooly' was a bit much! 🤣 SO cool to see Danny back and having fun though, GAWD I miss him! ✌🏻👍🏼 🇦🇺
Broken Hill is shown very close to the VIC border where it is at least 280 km away - other than that what a great PR show this is and keeping Dan in the public eye...LOVE IT!
Everything right with this clip: Dannyboy in his natural environment and the sound of that engine!
Now this is the content I've been waiting for.  Missed you, Honey Badger.
this looked like a trailer for forza horizon 3
Looks like Daniel couldn't wait till 2024 to drive an F1 car aye
Daniel and Hannah!? Yes!!
This better have come out of the catering budget
EPIC........!!!!!!!!!
Que joya de vídeo! Que bien se ve el Trophy Truck al lado del RB7!
@2:07 that's taking dirty air to a whole new level.
Am I the only one that got goosebumps when he was removing the cover off and gearing up?
What a damn good vid by RBR. Best one yet.
How can anyone simply not love Daniel Riccardo? ♥
I demand there be a BLUEY integration with this!
DR publicity King . What happened?
Where is Jack Miller?
Still got the rb7? yeah back in the shed m8
So unsafe without a Halo, what if a Kangaroo would jump infront and start boxing Riccardo
Epic content, as allways!
Gotta love Daniel. The only likeable person at RB F1. Fantastic marketing as always though.
You guys should do this accross Canada next on the way to the Canadian GP :p
I am surprised that Renault engine lasted.
I'd KILL to see an actual F1 race at Baffist....  Been there many times. Euro trash would shit themselves, but LOVE it!!!!
Yeah, DR3 is back 😁❤
Warms the heart to see Daniel having fun again
D should be driving a ferrari
Feels like Forza Horizon 4 intro but real life.
Nobody does better commercial films than Redbull
❤
Gives me the crew 2 vibes
Who is this Daniel Sanders guy :P
Awesome video, but makes you wonder how many races he could have won if he never left Redbull hey.
awesome 🎉
Wish it was actually Daniel in this video!!
The most charismatic man on and off the paddock, love seeing him rip it!
Cmon y’all that’s not even Daniel in the car
Riccy might not be driving an F1 car on track this year, but I bet he has more fun this year than the boys at his previous team at McLaren...
Max Sexstappen
Anyone else notice that Daniel started out out driving a literal orange tractor before hopping back in the red bull?
Red Bull Dor da Horizon?
Yes love this.... Missed you Daniel in the Redbull videos. Those are so good. Welcome home..
Absolutely couldn't do that in a McLaren.... just sayin - Go you good thing!
This was absolutely great showing off Australia! Loved everything about this video!!
RBR finally putting in Hannah Schmitz (RBR F1 Principal Racing Strategist) in their videos.  Mad Props!  There is no doubt that other Formula 1 Teams will snatch Hannah Schmitz the second RBR decides not to pay her what she deserves. Ferrari is praying for that day to come.
Is it new Forza Horizon game presentation? )))
best marketing projects
Come on Checo!!! 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
I notice they mocked mclaren 😂
Feels like the intro scene of Forza Horizon 6
WOOOWWW 😁 ❤
forza horizon
Only Max kills the mood.
Much love to Daniel and the Team!
I think they've gone over the budget cap with this 😅 F1 car, stunt bike, helicopter, racing plane, baha truck, stock car Welcome back, Daniel
Not seeing danny on the grid kills me but his corny acting in this dope promo makes it sting a little less 😂
Danny Ric playing Forza Horizon 6
damn, those plane shots are epic, gotta love RB's marketing projects - best in the business for sure.
The Stig's Australian cousin.
Miss him sooo much, what a legend!
I want MORE of this type of content!! Daniel ❤
As an Aussie, that was pretty cringeworthy
I'm a nerd. I like the videos that Mercedes, Williams, and AMR put out on the more technical side of the house. Post-race talking points, etc. However, I will always say yes to DR and/or tire changes in zero g. Very nice!
Imagine having F1 racing at Butthurts. That would be epic.
Too much corn for my taste.
Drifting an F1 car on Gravel.  That's just nuts regardless who's behind the wheel.
This seems way more fun than driving the 2023 McLaren 🤣
The most weirdest thing here is that they put V8 Supercars Chevrolet Camaro instead of mustang. As far as I know Red Bull and Ford partnership was confirmed just recently. It's fine with me, fan of chevy and a hater of ford.
I know this sounds horrible, but can Checo or max get sick with a stomach flu JUST ONCE so we can see Daniel in a red bull one more time?!? I bet he SLAYS it
Danny Ric content is the best content
I love this man so much, hope he's happy 🥺 Love u Ric! Wishing you the best💜
So much fun! Well done everyone!
This is why red bull is the best…. Simply unmatched
THE CREW!!!!
Dan is a big asset of red bull %)
3:10
I hope Daniel can try RB19 in Fp1 or 2 in melbourne
Love Danny Ric
So good to see dr back in the car😅
Warms my heart to see daniel back in a redbull
One of the best things I've seen recently.  What a legend.
Always wished for F1 at Bathurst
THE LEGEND HAS RETURNED! GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK :)
This was a masterpiece. Well done 👏🏼
The fact this team does advertising funny too im lovin this team even more after all these crazy things they do and ofc danny
Hands down RBR has the best marketing team ! Much love from India ❤️
I bet driving that RB on trails is like ice skating with your pants down.
Isn't it great if we get to see DR doing his job as reserve driver for a few races this season for Redbull, esp if its DR vs Checo.
There should have been redbull ktm MotoGP rider Jack Miller as well🐻
An F1 car at Bathurst. Thank you RedBull!! Although I am really curious about the real one-lap performance of an F1 car over there.  Also, was that Hannah? If so, oh wow, she' looks as awesome as ever.
Daniel Ricardo carrying the red bull f1 team in the personality department 🎉
that 10.10 joke was so good
Great to see you back at RB..
Welcome back daniel our funniest guy ❤️🏎
Red Bull uses its old F1 cars to do crazy & fun stuff. Be like Red Bull!!
All of this just to sell a few more cans
It's absolutely incredible how you get this things done. Altough I just watched it, it still seems inimaginable seeing F1 car doing drifts on dirt like Danny just did it.🤯 Respect guys. Hope I'll be able to be part of the team in the future ☺️
Red Bull might be on to something here- as the marketting geniuses they are, Daniel is a goldmine of endless possibilities for the brand.  Great fokin job.
No other team would ever
Was this actual Daniel Ricciardo?
This literally plays like a Forza Horizon introduction, and I am *_here for it_*
I love Danny Ric's  smile and I forgot how much I missed seeing him on my screen. And now I desperately want to go to Australia. Wonderful video.
Love seeing the Honey Badger back at it !!!
Red Bull 🤝 Forza Horizon
IRL Forza Horizon
if you have videos of an rb racing a jet how is that tiny copter ever going to stack up to litteraly the same car that raced a jet? i get it it's some lighthearted entertainment but a little consistancy would be nice
This is Daniel in his element. Right on Red Bull, great content keep ‘em coming 🔥
It's impossible not to love Danny. Your rock mate.
Riccardo is literally a gold mine for Red Bull! Glad to know I don't have to live in a world without new Daniel Riccardo F1 content!
Well done mate. The best thing on you tube by far and Daniel its always good to see you challenging the envelope well entertaining us. Wishing you all the best and can't wait to see you back in a competitive F1 seat.
Giving Forza horizon vibes with the helicopter race
The sweat athlete is back
i fly the helicopter seen in this video, you can out run this helicopter with a ford focus, its very slow lmao
This feels like the intro to a forza horizon game
Daniel had to borrow Mark's old car?  Where was the RB10?
👏👏👏👏👏👏😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
I've been dreaming of seeing Daniel back in a Red Bull ever since he left. Its so great to see him home ♡ Welcome back Daniel!!! Also shootout to Queen Hannah, Red Bull is lucky to have you. Keep the Daniel content coming, with a little bit of Maxiel thrown in there please 🥺
Daniel is so awesome!! This video was great!! 🤙🏼💯 keep pushing Riccardo 💯
Doing marketing for RedBull doesn’t look like the worst job in the world
Oh how i have missed this....
Imagine hitting a kangaroo in that thing
The Redbull content we’ve been waiting for. Why can’t F1 allow 3 drivers per team 😩
Ric ric ric ric ric ric ric ric ric ric ric ric ric ric ric...kikiki rrra....💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
The content we need❤
It is sad that F1 doesn't race at Australia's best track
Willkommen Daniel
Home sweet home
There's only 1 DR3!
This is the best motorsports promotional video that’s ever been made! 🇦🇺
I would really like to see the team washing this F1...
Red Bull does the coolest shit with their cars
I said this preveusly. This guy is the best to promote this sport. Race winner, extremely good driver, charismatic, funny , respectfull. The complete package
Bills Mafia is excited to see the honey badger back in the car. 🎉
Is it actually Dan driving though, somehow i doubt it. Great seeing all the other Red Bull athletes!
Awesome video.
He has the best job in F1 getting paid millions not to race and do cool shit like this
Everyone who watches this share and  like and let's get this epic video to go Viral !!!!! What a way to showcase redbull and our beautiful country Australia 🇦🇺 ❤F1
This made my day. Great to see dani ric in a Red Bull again
Man F1’s at Mount Panorama would be such a vibe !!
YEAAAAAAA
I know you guys wont let him drive the race at Melborne but at least let Daniel drive a FP session!
Daniel, I have no idea if you will actually read this, but good on ya mate. Love Redbull for taking in a legend thats is just as crazy as they are, F1 needs personalities like yours! I hope you are having an absolute blast with the team, you deserve it. Sidenote to redbull, we won't mind seeing vids like this before every single grandprix ;-)
I think Daniel needs his own show 🙏😏😉😂. Missing you on the grid but happy you get to do dope stuff like this again!!
GO DANNY!!!!!!
i remember he said honda is crap and he will never drive that junk thats why he went to renault. glad they gave him the renault to drive...
Danny Ric❤
I don't F care if hes being called "Third driver".  *_Without a doubt he had to be the happiest racing driver in the world again._*
Lo mejor de lo mejor ver a Daniel divertirse haciendo lo que le gusta correr😊!!!
Boi is backkkkkk in blue
I think it's safe to say Danny is having a much better time back at Red Bull than he ever did at McLaren.
I’m not gonna lie. Hope he gets the chance to race the car just once this year.
Looks like Daniel dodged a bullet in leaving McLaren during 2023
it be crazy to see danny replace verstappin. Would be heartfelt and he would obey team orders
that engine sound 🔥
😘😘😘😘😘
Can we take a second and talk about that helmet?! Absolute beauty, It's so good to see him in RB colors!
Where have you been during the Fires in 2020, Daniel/ Dani-Boyyy????
This was better then the entire DTS 5th season
This is so much better than being Zak Browns pool boy, I tell you what.
Why does this feel like a forza horizon mission
DR back in a Red Bull, what a sight to behold. Live your best life, King!
Daniel Ricciardo is the man!!
Ric over Max all day ! Ric & Perez
HANNAH!!!
Wanna see him in RB19
Daniel！ Daniel！ Daniel！Welcome back.
Danny + RB are a perfect match.
This is where he belongs❤️
This is sick!
8x race winner, casually raking in millions from Mclauren while doing RB promo, love that for him
IN HANNAH SCHMITZ WE TRUST
Vote down below for Daniel getting his seat back.⬇
Sorry but I have never got on with DR's whole demeaner ... I just don't find him funny , more irritating than a mozzie bite... Exhibition stuff is all he's really good for as long as they keep him quiet... Hope for gods sake RBR don't consider letting him back in a  seat for any GP... Out to pasture for good
This video is so sick, welcome back daniel
Ricciardo living his best life.
BIG. BRAIN. HANNAH.
6:47 Green Red Bull
real life forza intro
Now just get him in a car back in F1.
Yes Danni ric
Wow daniel ricciardo end it just for the show 😢
Marketing at its finest like always !!:)
Ah yes, perfect conditions to use wet tires. Didnt know red bull hired ferrari strategists!
No one does it like RB with these vids
Love this! Cant wait to see more Daniel!!!
This is some Big Ric Energy! We love you DR! 💙
Real life Forza
Sad to see they are using him for brand advertisement only 😢
Oh god , F1 needs Daniel
Danny Ric doing what he loves, driving the best car, and still has the same number of points as his former team after 2 races!
That's not really him driving
When you're the most famous Australian on the grid even though you are not on the grid
RIc
Como siempre, excelente y espectacular video de Red Bull... Amazing
They have a racing team like no other…. But they are def not actors hahahaha
I only subscribed because of daniel
We need mount panorama in f1 calendar
Welcome back home!
Riff at 8 min.
Crazy how danny managed to score the same amount of points this season as McLaren without even having a car!
Always watching from Georgetown Guyana south America 🇬🇾🇬🇾🇬🇾
Ricciardooooooooo!!! Waiting for day Max is sick and we'll see Daniel again and Perez to be the World Champion
Epic!!!!!!!! Can we get a video on how you all setup the car for off-roading?!??!!!!!!
If only they could race F1 at Mount Panorama.
They asked Max to be in the video too, but he responded "I told you already. You guys don't ask that again to me. Are you clear about that? I gave you my reasons and I stand by it"
Welcome home mate! that RB7 still sounds amazing
Daniel Riccairdo is the backbone of f1 pr
Is that ms Schmidt?
When you use the test driver for PR, you know it's been easy 😂
They have abused the rb7 so much
If not possible with RB, I wish the honey badger lead toro Rosso or whatever is called now to a better place
Danny Ric, the ultimate PR machine... 🎉
When Red Bull said Welcome home.....they means Welcome HOMESSS !
shoutout to Forza Horizon 3 which brought the spirit of Australia so well in so many living rooms.  Danny Ric 🤝 Red Bull = perfect combo
Hannah Schmitz on this video is all we need
I’m sure Checo is finding this type of excitement for a “reserve” driver very natural. 😂
Red Bull makes everything seem like GTA 5 online
RedBull siendo RedBull <3
feels like a forza horizon mission
His McLaren couldn't even make it out of the garage 😂 Good luck with those dud cars Piastri
Yeah nah That car looks so much better then the current cars. And mint to see Dani in his element
3:04 why was a wet compound tyre on in the desert? 💀 💀
Baru kali ini nonton ga aku skip🗿
DR3 back on RB gotta be the greatest PR move in years.
What do they do with the cars after these off-road shoots? Surely all the gravel and dirt kicking up can’t be good on paint and parts??
More Danny Rics content please 🥰
Well done Redbull! Marketing +1, Ricciardo +1, all the racing aussies +1... Redbull allways great videos +1!
I need captions
Ridiculous marketing…. And I enjoyed every moment of it. So damned good to see Danny’s smiling mug.
...Eat Sleep Race Repeat...
Yeah Danny is back...on a green screen for the first minute and that's about it.
The PR driver role suits Ricciardo well.
This was super cool. As much as I’m sure he still wants to race in F1, I think there’s a huge piece of him that loves doing some fun stuff like this in his time off. He’ll be back rippin soon enough, and we’ll all be ready for it.
I’m totally ready to create a video with F1 ! :)
Didn't understand anything
So glad Daniel is back all I am asking is u give him at least one free practise so we can see what he can do
This 😢
Como é bom ver o Ricciardo pilotar!
Daniel just causally has an F1 car in his shed 🤣
Brilliant, bloody brilliant, Daniel is the most fun F1 driver in F1 History.
So Rad. Love seeing Daniel back with RB.
Love jt
Awesome!
I didn’t want to like this… but INCREDIBLE!
finally a video with Daniel
An F1 car on dirt reminds me of a 1/10 scale RC RWD stadium truck.  Way too much power for its own good on the dirt. lol
And for 9 lovely mintues, all was right in the world
Absolutely beautiful, sea cliff bridge
you realy know how to sell a energy drink 🔥
he got paid not only to stop driving mclaren tractor but also to drive round in that awesome v8 xddd
Good to see Danny getting into some good old Forza Horizon 3~!
That was a slow stop😂😂
Love to see him back in the redbulls videos🙌 Love you danny. Welcome home!
Feliz por Danny R que este en red bull ahora tengo mi trilogía favorita max checo y Danny falta que traigan a Vettel y Webber y estaríamos 😏
Red Bull is for sure one of the worlds top sports teams. They are in everything. Not just racing.
Daniel in Orange Tractor, does the orange tractor represent mclaren?
Sad how you have turned a great driver into a clown.  Destroyed another career.  Good on you RedBull
a like for DR!
Thank you so much Oracle Red Bull Racing!  I'm so lost without Dan on the grid, but you just made me cry and smile for this videos past 9 minutes. I'm now coming away from this feeling a renewed hope and a much broader outlook for the future.  Cannot thank you enough for keeping my love for this sport *ALIVE* 🏎❤
cant believe five years later I got to see DR back in redbull and getting involve in this kind of videos skskskjsdjdjdskksjksd
Not good enough to drive in a race but you can drive in a video to make money 😂
Ricardo and Checo is the only reason to like Red Bull.
this makes me sad somehow
I can't believe they had Danny driving a McClaren in the opening scenes.
Danny's voice... kinda different here! :D
Man an f1 race on dirt would be kinda cool. I know its dang near impossible but it would be kinda cool
Wow the first piece of Red Bull racing content I didn’t hate
They are really turning video game missions into real life. Amazing
Daniel driving is really good with the tractor now after all that time at McLaren
DANIELLLLLL RICCCCIARDOOO
team red bull this is my humble request to do 400 km/h + in an f1 car please please
Loved This ! Love from India
NEXT VIDEO NEEDS A LAWRENCE BROTHER CAMEO
Hannah 😍
Red Bull always wins the best promo vid when it comes to creativity and fun. Good to see you back Danny!
Welcome back,Daniel! I'm  looking  forward to your  race  with  Red Bull .
This should be a Forza Horizon mission😄
Daniel! That sound! Thanks RedBull! Funny how the hybrid era cars are almost never used for promotional events/footage.
Bro casually had an RB7 wrapped in the shed
What an epic video. We watch rally cars often in theses conditions but not F1. I’d say she’s recked
Things you love to see
Redbull Racing Team- impeccable on track, insane off it!
welcome back to RB, DR3🎉🎉
Cant wait for the new Maxiel content ❤
When you can take a break and still drive a F1...  legendary clip bro in the leagues of Gymkana  Welcome home Daniel and I mean Oz more than RB
Pit crew playing cricket, that was funny.  Screaming F1 engine, ah they good ole' days.
This is so lame. Reminds me of that awful car 'launch' they did for this season. Can't believe D Ricc has reduced himself to this stuff and no race seat.
Can't wait to see one of these with Jack Miller an danni .it'll be a beaut I bet .🤙🏼
they signed the man just for promo. they have no intention to have him race.
F1 at Mt. Panorama would be epic. Nice cameo from Jamie Wincupp.
I’m here for this ❤DR3
Welcome home Daniel, welcome home 😊
From the creators of "GaSLy DeSerVeS tHe RB sEaT", here's another season yet of YT keyboard warriors filling the comment section with stupidity hoping for Perez to fail so someone else takes his seat 🙄
Can’t wait to see him in track again
One of the most beautiful sights in life dani ric in a redbull brings my emotions out u know
Thats why I love redbull so much
aw daniel driving the new mclaren at the start
“See you in Melbourne Dan!” 🤔🤔🤔
This makes me so happy to see him back 🥲
Petition for area to be a track and Welcome back Daniel!!😀
🍯🦡
1:37 *Jumps over F1 Car, offroad.*  «G’day Mate» that’s the most Australian thing ever 😂
Daniel back at Redbull. You love to see it.
AHHH WELCOME HOME, INDEED!!! YEEHAW 🫶🏼
They are going to be using the old V8 era cars as show cars for the rest of eternity haha,  because the new engines are just too expensive to maintain and run, and usually returned to the manufacturer after the season.  (The F1 car featured in this video is TWELVE YEARS OLD) :)
Cringed a little. Sorry Dan
What a waste of a drvier !
Please say he has a practice session soon!
Christian Horner:  "Danni, Let Max through" Helmut Marko:  "I thought we fired this guy."
I liked how mechanics were playing cricket
More dani content
Imagine Danny Ric actually driving a session or two in Melbourne
Redbull should definitely upload this on their main channel. That was awesome!
Love Daniel! Welcome home!
@Christian Horner, what is Daniel racing again in F1? Perhaps give him a boost with your rocket car! 💪🏻
Is Lawson driving there or Ric? Lawson was in Australia filming couple months ago.
Seeing Ricciardo in a Red Bull gave me nostalgia of the good all days, when Mercedes was the villain of the movie.
Red bull media with Daniel is another level, thanks for having him back.
No better driver to show you around the mountain than Shane.   Great clip team.
SICK
Why hiring this piece of shit again, Redbull, why?
I feel like I'm watching a mini episode of Grand Tour
Most Aussie thing ever!! Love it! ❤
That last great to have you back just hit different damn lets hope he drives for rb this year for at least 1 race XD miamiiiii
It is so damn nice to see dani back in an in an F1 car specially in a RB  Much love RBfam  Love seeing the fellow ausie in action ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This was painfully cringe....apart from an F1 car on gravel.
So good to see daniel back in te redbull
I'm a simple man. I see Danny Ric, I smile, he smiles, I press Like. Edit - It seems like it's not Daniel. I had my doubts and I was right. It's Liam Lawson.
The best video 🔥🔥🔥 Danyyyyyyyy Riiiiccccc 💙❤️😍❤️
Is it Liam Lawson doing all the driving? (he was out in Australia earlier this year) or Daniel?
The acting is so obvious 😂
Hi redbull, where is the video checo, winner arabi saudí???
SVG’s blank smile 0:48 😂
Red Bull makes the best long form factor ads.
Goosebumps guaranteed 🔥
Crikey! Red Bull sure has some coin to burn for just saying “Welcome back Daniel”.
Increíble ver a Daniel en un RB y también es ver a Hannah en un video
Wanna buy a Tag Heuer Now😭
So bad, it's good!
Product placement was well done and not intrusive loved it
It’s beautiful 🥲
Шикарно!!!)))
Datz some goofy Arse sh!t.
Dinny Ric Does it again!! Fantastic drive@@
So glad to see Daniel back in marketing! I also love his lid!
Can we talk about the turnaround Daniel Ricciardo has had? A year ago he was driving a mid car in a team he wasn't fully gelling with. The Piastri drama must have been frustrating, but Daniel got paid 18 million to not drive mclaren's slow ass car this year, and now he is back at his home team driving around championship-winning Red Bulls IN THE FREAKING OUTBACK. He's winning fr
Red Bull does some wild stuff. I love how they celebrate their athletes.
This once again proves that we need an f1 race at Mt panorama. Not a race a melbourne
With all the love for DR from the Fans even if he doesn't stay in F1 he should stay at Red Bull Racing/Motorsports for these promos and stunts
glad Danny could take a break from F1 and take on rally instead
A Formula 1 in Bathurst, driven by Daniel Ricciardo. Thank you, Red Bull, for spending millions on this. Beautiful.
Rip to the mechs cleaning 😅
YESSS THE NO.1 AUSSIE
Was that a dingo in his shed?  LOL.
Common RedBull activities
Good to see the nr 3 back on the car😏
Must be jack miller here too🤟🏻🤟🏻 and scoty
Ric3 is the best thing that can happen for a Teams reputation ngl❤
Amazing content…
Love to see the icon Hannah Schmitz in this video!! She is my inspiration for real
Being on the RedBull pit crew is instant LEGEND status
Forza Horizon 6 looks great (but a bit disappointed that it takes place in Australia again)
Why still use 2013 Car in all show events?
Daniel Ric has become a mascot LOL
When Daniel was driving for Red Bull, he never had a championship winning car. Red Bull should give him a chance to drive and prove all his doubters WRONG. Love you Daniel 🎉
I have to see this ausie guy in real race next year. Im about missing him so fuckin bad ❤❤❤❤
Lets go Danny!!!!!!!
Yes boys 💥💥💥🏎🇦🇺🏁
Bit cheesy
I feel like old Red Bull cars shit bricks every time they open the hangar door.
This is why I love redbull. No pomp no circumstance. Just doing cool shit for the sake of doing cool shit.
Imagine collab Jack Miller and Daniel Ricciardo
He better drive the gp
Getting Ken Block vibes and I love it. Keep on Daniel!
Awesome
😂 loved the bit of humor in the vid  welcome back Daniel
so you wanted test your car before austarlian gp, thats why u took your old car ? xD just kidding
Legal
Can you guys achieve my dream of driving an f1 car down the great ocean road
Well its not like he is ever gonna drive for Red Bull F1 again.. its just marketing. Its a good thing McLaren let him go, because that team is a shitshow, but his F1 days are over. When they need a reserve driver they will call Liam Lawson 100%. No one will be glader then me if i´m wrong, but sadly i´m probably not.
The acting and script was pretty cringy 😂
God I Love the Red Bull Marketing Team ! Good Job Guys.
Those colours suit dani well. Missed that smile. Great vid
To me, these videos are what make Red Bull F1, Red Bull F1! Regardless of what kind of season they're having, you can count on 'em to make some top notch, F1 powered entertainment!
Legendary ;-D
Gotta love redbull videos like this.
He's still has the energy
That must be some s😢fun driving that car in the dirt!
Forza Horizan Showcase IRL - RB is amazing as ever
Awesome job by the marketing department! Right up there with the caravans.
Babe, wake up Daniel Ricciardo is back in a redbull F1 car
I honestly would like to think that Daniel did steal his RB7 lol and he has had it in the shed thinking no one knew he took it... But they all knew.   I would though honestly like to see a proper lap of Bathurst
So now we know the RB14 (?) is good to go down under ;)
MASSA
5:37 Dropbears! The first prank my co-workers pulled on me when I did my internship at the Engineering department of Virgin Australia 😂 For a while I believed there were vicious Koalas out there who would attack jumping on people from the trees!
when the chopper hovers by him *RIP INTAKE*
I like how they included Hannah
0:06 THE BEST SCENE ,,THE KANGAROO..🦘❤
Where have I seen this kid. Seems like he might join f1 and beat his four time world champion teammate in his debut season for the team.
No way Checo/Max using that car in Melbourne 😂😂😂
Pretty sure this was filmed in a closed road not bcuz there are no others cars, but cuz there are NO ROOS walking in the middle of the road trying to kill themselv an the driver…
The visor cleaning was the best bit!
Love to see the red bull ( last v8) to go around Bathurst at 95%.  Please include full incar for us all to see.  Cheers
This is why I'm a fan of RBR!
After the Aussie race they will but him back in the box ;D
This is what doing it in the RedBull way means! Loved it
Daniel's out there living the forza horizon lifestyle
I am going to  go out and buy a red bull
Love it!
As a big Max fan, let's hope Daniel gets back in the red bull in near future! I do miss him with his big smile. Maybe he is not as fast as Checo anymore, but a lot more fun tbh!
Miss having him on the Grid.
‘Another bridge scene?’😭😭
Forza Horizon vibes
I'm not crying, you are!  Love you Danny, welcome back home.
very well done promo. cheers
What track was this?
Best video I’ve seen in ages. Proud to be an Aussie. Brilliant to see Dan in the red bull colours again.
Can't wait for mount panorama to bec a main f1 track
I love all you Aussie fucko's.
If only they didnt speak like NPCs in these videos
I want a German race just to give RedBull a reason to get an F1 car to the Nurburgring
2:55 good to see the pit crew still not ready for daniel in the pits
Daniel def won life by joining RedBull at that point😂
Seriously cool, Red Bull and Daniel the best team.
Red Bull got their hype man back, even if he's not racing.
Lol only thing the wet tires are good for. Dirt driving
Let's gooooo
Red Bull's 2023 budget cap after seeing this video: nervous sweating
How ridiculous from RedBull use Daniel like puppet
Hate red bull, love Danny ric. What 2021 or 2022 could of been if he stayed. Red bull have got the best car at the min but I still think Danny Ric is better than Max.
The most unrealistic thing in this video is the servo being fully stocked with tall boy redbull cans
That RB7 sounds so good! Bet they all had fun making this, cheesy lines aside.
Saia da frente canguru, Daniel está de volta.
can't believe i'm watching a redbull video urgh the things that i would do for daniel ricciardo
Awesome video guys
None of that driving was actually Daniel was it, Red Bull.. 🤨
That video gives me Forza Horizon vibes, particularly the showcase events.
blooody hel
I heard Perez will be sick this weekend ;)
НУ хоть тут ему дали место погонять, как гонщик уже стал не нужен в ф1, промо ролики теперь клепать.Травмы не чего, он же не работает!
Please Daniel  become second driver again soon
That was just awful and yet fantastic all at once!
I want that Mount Panorama F1 onboard lap so bad.
Danny boy if that does not get you wanting back on the track nothing will your a boss keep bossing see you back on the grid next year big ric energy 😅😂
8:31 3 Albon
So glad I saw this irl at Bathurst 12 hour a couple weeks ago amazing 💯
Will he drive in pratiS?
I'm not crying, you're crying T_____T
I like how they went "Do you still got that RB7?" as though every RB F1 driver has a RB7.
I haven't been a fan of Redbull since this guy left. But he has my support wherever he goes! Cheers Mate!
Aussie Aussie Aussie 🇦🇺🦘
This video has mad Gymkhana energy!! RIP Ken Block💔
Max out, Daniel In. Please.
No way they put Daniel in an orange tractor at the start😭
Welcome back, Mr. Shoey, Daniel Ricciardo!
F1 should think about ditching the current safety cars (+ drivers) and get the RB safety car from this video (including Shane van Gisbergen as driver if possible).
sooo good to see Daniel back at RBR  Welcome back, Dani Ric
Only RedBull Works this hard and Plays even harder!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great Job folks!
These videos are normally pretty cheesy. This one was too, but it was also kinda awesome 👌
The pit crew playing cricket was golden 😂Great Stuff!
Haha! Can't wait for more DR3 content. loved it
I wonder, are these demo cars taken apart to get the sand out of every corner and crevice after a shoot? The car gets put through a lot, I presume it needs to be cleaned rigorously
Wow
That’s 😂 so funny. Danny ric in verstappen out. 🎉 😂😂😂😂
Perez needs a better contract so Daniel can take his seat back!
An F1 in Mount Panorama!? Sick! XD
You can never have enougfh Danny Ric!
DANNY RIC!!!!
Well done Red bull amazing footage the footage on the Seacliff bridge in the beautiful coastal city of wollongong nsw Australia wow wow wo just wow. Brilliant marketing and thankyou for showing my home city of Wollongong nsw Australia
Lessgo Daniel, making us Aussies proud buddy
Que video ❤  Ver a Daniel otra vez es emoción en la Fórmula 1
I forgot he was with Red Bull, so I thought this was like 5 years ago, but I looked at when it was posted, and I was like "oh".
air filters: am I a joke you?
Didn’t Liam Lawson drive at Bathurst?
wow the new forza horizon sure has upgraded its graphics.
Awesome
Daniel i miss you. The best F1 driver ever... Redbull Thanks for this moment
really cool video
That was cool watching Danny Ric and SVG go around Bathurst together👍😎
How good is this video and right here in the beautiful coastal city of wollongong nsw Australia. The home of the Seacliff bridge in the Wollongong suburb of Clifton. Amazing footage wow wow wow. How good does Wollongong look
Great to see Daniel back suit and helmet in Redbull
So who is he replacing then?
Did DR actually drive any of that?
Hey Red Bull, you do realize how good Danny Ric makes you look, right?
Felt like a FH4 dlc trailer that we never got
I don't know but I feel sad after watching this
Is that really driving by Daniel..!! Wow
Rb7 screaming with Dani in it 🫠
Please have him as a cheko replacement...plsss🙏🙏
The crew 2 in 4k
I made a comment earlier today and though I would check out the comments attached to this awesome video tonight. Holy sh*t, I have never ever seen so many comments for the love of a video and equally the love for Danny Ric.  RB wake up to yourselves, you have an incredible marketing genius on your books again that also happens to be good enough to be in that 2nd seat.  If this response doesn’t tell you that then you need your head read. Put Checo into Alpha Taurie in 2024 to  see out his contract and put Dan where he belongs, that 2nd seat.
This is Daniel place 🎉
Formula One. Red Bull Racing. Daniel Ricciardo. As one combination. What else do you need?
Daniel is still here 😂
Thats great content
Great to see Dani Ric back in a RB!
Can’t wait to see Daniel in the paddock!
So great to see Dani
i'd say the data indicates you need new air filters every 10 minutes or the car will overheat and choke :D so much dust!
Daniel better than Max... anyway
RB really knows how to do business
If only the Australian grand prix was at Bathurst...
NGL seeing the 3 back on the car just feels RIGHT!
Finally Hannah The GOAT starring in one of those 😎
Daniel and Hannah in one video? Good morning to me!!!! Love to see Daniel back where he really belongs. He's home <3
I am so glad to see him back! He never should have left. Let’s make it a good one Danny!
We love the Honey Badger! Great to see Danny back at Red Bull. (And great job to the content marketing folks on another stellar video)
Simply simply lovely to see Daniel back at Redbull
Great to see Daniel back in a RedBull!
Seeing an F1 car in dirt I don't know how I feel a bit of sorry for the car but fun at the same time 😂
RB out here recreating Forza Horizon
Just wow ! :)
Drove past my house the other day
Bloody awesome. Wish he was still racing in F1 this year 😢
As a dani and F1 fan this is the best pre race thing I've seen🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁
This brings a tear to my eye!!   Welcome back Daniel!!!! ❤❤❤
Hope to see old Danny Ric back...💓
Ma men Ricardoooo !!!!
I raced so many times in Mount Panorama in project cars 2. It looks exactly like that.
Verstappen doesn't even have a inch of a heart compared to DR
Absolutely need to know who cost cap does this get charged to ? 😂😂😂
I hope I speak for a lot of people when I say 'We miss you on track Danny Ric', your enthusiasm is infectious.  Hope this man gets a racing seat next year!
Except that's Liam Lawson driving and not Daniel
Daniel back in RB promos!!! Gonna love this!
Danny Ricc on Mt Panorama. Doesn't get better than that!
Good to see Daniel in his RB7
so iconic that they parked the car in 7 eleven lol
This looks so awesome! Welcome back Danny Ric! 😊🇦🇺❤️🦡🦘
What a shame that it’s not Danny Ric in the car.  They had Liam do that instead…  Bit of a shame they still have Ric doing the voice when he wasn’t there.   But that’s marketing for ya.   Still glad he’s back at RBR though
welcome home Daniel, the only place u belong <3
Now that's what I call some quality content!
Got 18 mil just to play arround on RB's What a chad
this just made my day... thanks a lottt red bull!!
Oscar proving Danny ric should stick to marketing 😂😂😂
Damn it's good to see Danny Ric back in a Red Bull.
How wonderful to see Daniel again :D
They forgot to mention that Matt Hall is the reigning Red Bull Air Race World Champion. He's also working to bring the series back to life and hold a round of the series from his home airfield at Lake Macquarie NSW.
That lady on the start, is she the famous smart strategies
Forza horizon 6 graphics seems to have gotten better. What graphics car were you running?
Danny Ric is such a gem. Regardless of his racing the past few years, I really hope he always stays part of F1 in some form. He has too much personality not to.
If this ain't Forza Horizon showcases in real life, I don't know what is
All I'm getting from this is that there should be dirt sections to F1 tracks, looks awesome lmao
05:40 / 05:46 "Drop bear!" 🐨🩸😂
The comment section reminds me of my company teams chat. So many company shills. There is a 'Gotta say something positive or I'll lose my job' vibe about it.  Anyway. Good to see Dan back at Red Bull.
Welcome home Daniel 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Liam Lawson has entered the chat.
This must be the dream drive a f1 car on the road in you home town. Welcome back Daniel🎉
Hannah so pretty
Wish I could like this twice!
AUSSIE AS FUCK!
🙏🏽❤👊🏽Love seeing him back @home! WelcomeBackMate!
0:21 Exclusive footage of Daniel Ricciardo driving this year's McLaren car
If they really used Riciardo for this. Then why is he wearing his helmet in every scène?
That's the most "the corporate is making me do this bullshit" acting i've ever seen
Epic……anyone would think he is driving this weekend.
Awww love Ricciardo, miss seeing him
Faltou o jack miller com a KTM
And not a hybrid in sight...
@OracleRedBull any chance Danny Ric can partner SVG for the Bathurst 1000?
This video gives major Forza Horizon 3 vibes.
Full onboard of a Bathurst lap! Now!
Glad to see DR in the car No.3 again
That was emotional! Great to have Daniel back at RBR! Wish him all the best!
Come on only the real ones know it was liam Lawson at bathurst
How F1 cars should really sound. Take off the limiter.
ferrari needs this kind of testing 🤣🤣
Is Hannah the biggest legend here?
This video contains an important not so hidden message about Daniel Ricciardo's FUTURE. It confirms that he will be racing in the Bathurst 1000 at Mount Panorama possibly even in 2023 as Shane Van Gisbergen's co-driver - unless of course it is Liam Lawson.
🥹🥹so happy for Dannyric
Love seeing Daniel in Rb colours again❤💛
OOOOOWWWWW that was fantastic RED BULL give Dan a seat.
First the cost cap breach, now illegal testing.
RAD 👍
Danny Ric! What a cast of legends in tow! See in you at Albert Park!!
Amazing content as always plus having Daniel show us a little bit of Australia is awesome. As a Mercedes fan, this is a better race to watch for now😊
Daniel’s helmet is on point shame wont see it on track 🥲
that was fully sick!!!
Even if it was just for the video, loved seeing Daniel back in Red Bull car. Looking forward to more great content !
Because Danny's back I'll buy a redbull😉
This felt exactly like a Forza Horizon showcase event
this is why redbull is the best f1 team ever            behind haas of course
These guys really hired Ricciardo for the sake of media 😂😂😂
Red Bull are experts at Marketing!
Is that Hannah ?
Haha. Good vid. Stop by in Brisbane next time Dan. 🤙
That RB7 is so durable. It literally has had some of the toughest conditions faced and ace it. As an West Aussie, I am so happy to see Ricciardo back at the team that does so well. Hopefully this is just the beginning of more to come.
Make this the official Australian Gp please
Really? No racing but he can film the promos.
Hahaha great video! Gogo Daniel! 👍💪😎
Red Bull really out here making Forza Horizon showcase events in real life...
So good to see Danny Ric having a great time whit his race family 🤜🏼🤛🏼💪🏼🙌🏼
Welcome back dude, when do you come to the Netherlands..?
Hannah!
Daniel is back home and already putting the work. Sick lid as well🔥
Daniel yessss 👊❤️ the best
awesome
DR belongs in F1 but I would love to see him in a V8 for Bathurst!!!!
Well done Liam Lawson for all the driving here, and Daniel Ricciardo on the voice overs
This feels like a forza horizon game made real  :D
Redbull always of track fun. Forza Horizon in real life :D Amazing
Epic
"Dont trash the car" trashes it rught out the box 😭😭
Was it really Dan in the car, or was it Liam Lawson? Please tell the truth?
You’d think that with all that money they’d be able to afford a few acting classes….
The seacliff bridge is about 10km from my house!
🎉🎉
Vamos Daniel era hora que vuelvas
And that alone makes his signing at RB worth it, now if there was only a way that either or the top 2 drivers could be denied a visa into Aus so he can line up on the grid 😂
What a cracker of a video! You can tell DR3 is right where he needs to be
Thisssss was so bloody GOOD  I loved every second of this !!!
DC is fumin right now 😂
that’s my boy!!!!
Greatest f1 video of all time.
No better driver for this than Daniel. Hope he gets the seat 2024
Awesome Danny 👌 🇦🇺
We want to see daniel driving RB19
You lot will really put your cars anywhere, in the words of Danny Ric hooley dooley
It was Liam Lawson driving in reality, not Ricciardo.
This video sponsored by McLaren loooool
Good to have Danny ric back at rb
This is the content I live for. The literal chills I've got. More of this please!
THE GOAT IS BACK!
DANNY RIC
Tough times for Dainel, be back soon.
Amazing 👏
Was it Daniel on the Seacliff bridge though? I thought it was Liam
make f1 race in bathurt, we want it
So good!!
Good fun road trip.  Classic Daniel.  But, nothing to do with F1 or getting Danny back in an F1 car.  And getting him back with Mad Max in a team which lets Max get away with anything, is simply not interesting.  I remember Baku, and Christian defending Max.  That was the end Danny at RB.
That last shot of Dan going over the hill is out the back of Silverton where they shot Mad Max
Just a reminder that McLaren payed him 18m to do this 😂
Dany having an rb7 is completely unrealistic. The mclaren would have been so much better.
Wen Being a reserve driver at redbull is way more fun then a full f1 driver at mc laren says alot😂
Red Bull racing but Larry
WE NEED MORE DANIEL CONTENT
I miss Daniel Ricciardo's "Pieeeeeeerrreee Gaaaaaaasssllyyyyy"
Really Danny looks so Happy .He Deserves a Championship..Hope one day Redbull will give it to him
Fair dinkum RB great to see Daniel back home mate !
Another Rebull W video
Toby Price on a car? Where's the bike? Does he plan on changing categories at Dakar? 😮 This part of the video was VERY distracting... Otherwise, excellent!! 👌
YESSSSSS DANNY!!!!
So who is your mystery stunt guy who does the driving?
And thus concludes my favourite piece of internet so far in 2023!
Look at the lad's smile... Thats mint
Madlad
Oh man, i really miss Danny Ric
The question is... Can you jump in F1 car ?
Top level acting by Hannah haha! Love to see her on this
This is why he came back, no other team does this great stuff.
รถสูงๆก่อนจะเจอปลาตะเพียร
ทางนี้รถเป็นสีดำครับ
So epic seeing DR back, and equally epic seeing a formula 1 car getting sideways on our outback roads!
Good to see Liam Lawson… I mean Daniel in the car 😅
😄
เอ็มโอ่
Epic Work Liam!
ดิ๊ฟรถแบบไดได้ปลาตระเพียรแม่แตง
And  this how marketing should be done for F1 Fans!!!!!
He'll have no chance if they Nab Hamilton #JustSayin
when world champion team meet redbull entertainment spirit
Mad -Max- Daniel
Dont understand why Redbull took him back, he's just another mark webber, had enough time to show his talent in various different cars and his speed was never there consistently. There's alot more faster and fresher and younger talent out there.  So Redbull why did u sign him as a test driver???
Not sure how much of that was AI generated... and as usual Tassie was missed 😂 .. but absolutely loved it, can't wait for the weekend!
Wait up, this is all Liam Lawson!
this was great but the kangaroo not jumping directly in front of the car was completely unrealistic.
That a boy Daniel. Getting to do all the cool shit in F 1 still. Love it good call going back to Ref Bull
i thought it was liam lawson in the car at bathurst
“It’s great to have you back” , wow. That has so much weight and the boy definitely deserves to hear it.
Glad they're not wasting Max and Checos time with this bullshit anymore
This is so stupid. I love it.
Daniel = Absolute genius marketing tool
This is so stupid. I love it.
Beats driving the McLaren tractor
This is so stupid. I love it.
this is what forza horizon desperetely try to be
I wish I could like this video 10000000000 times, I love Daniel and I love redbull!!!!!!!!!! Not to mention all the other Aussie legends in this clip!! This is my new favorite video on the internet.
Awesome our Dan Ricciardo 🤘🤘🤘🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
This went next level as soon as he got to Bathurst. Does that mean Jenson still holds the unofficial lap record in the McLaren or did Danny break it in the Red Bull?
The acting is about as good as Redbull's money management.🤣
Yeah that was corny as, but seeing Danny Ric back at RB, even if he's not racing, is just legendary.   Now I wanna see some F1 cars go round the Mountain!
Love seeing Danny Ric back home down under
You mean Daniel “Liam Lawson” Ricciardo’s aussie trip
8:13 *spots myself*
That was Bloody Bonza ,Red Bull
Fan bloody tastic!!!!!!!!!!!
❤❤❤❤
Red Bull marketing team is a beast, they sure know how to put out a great video
Fully Sick Mate 🤟🏻

Now wait a minute!  That pit stop at the pub.  Jack placement:  good.  Tyre change:  excellent.  Wiping visor… everything else stopped.  That’s a 0.3824 second delay.  That would drive the usual F1 driver nuts.  But Dany is no ordinary F1 pilot and he won’t be deterred.  He has got this!!  Fun video.
WE'RE BACK BABY!!!!!! HECK YEAHHHH!!!!!
So happy to see Danny Ric
u bring a smile in my face^^ ty all rb heros!
My road trip in Australia wasn't so fast ^^
Red bull racing do crazy thing it's best things ever  Danieyyyyyyyyyyelll 🏁🏁
I have waited for a Danny ric video from red bull for 5 years welcome back daniel
Woohoo!
Thought this is an old video. Daniel in RB 🎉
oh my gosh! you guys created a masterpiece
Shame it wasn't actually Daniel driving, not at Bathurst at least....
Good to see Daniel and the RB7
Isn’t it Liam Lawson driving at Bathurst.
So great seeing Dan back in a Red Bull🥰
What’s with 80% of time spent in NSW I completely understand Bathurst but all the rest ??
We miss you DR ❤️🇵🇹
g'day m'ate
0:37 they might wanna tell RedBull racing that Shane van Gisbergen is not australian
F1 car as an offroader, guys, this is more than I would've ever dared to ask 😆😆
WELCOME BACK DANIEL 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
You don't even show anything in Melbourne 😢
@redbullracing give him a real drive! Mint ad though.
Todo mi apoyo a este maravilloso equipo en el Gran Premio. ❤❤❤❤
HAHAHA great acting 0:22 from the red bull team
Surprised his tyres were ready for that pit stop 😮
Daniel Ricciardo is back!
NPCs everywhere.
Oh Daniel ricciardooooooo oh Daniel ricciardooooooo lol he got good old frikin seat as reserve at red bull plz hope he gets a seat for 2024
Epic!  Loved it, almost as good as Supercheap oil campaign ads!   Good to see so many Aussie legends on here that rip up the world stage.
I will watch any and all Danny Ric content
"Have you still got that RB7?" That wasn't his car akjsdhfa??
As an Australian and a massive DR fan I cannot like this enough 😂😂❤️❤️
LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
DANIEL YESSS👍
where' s ozzyman?
Hanna is ❤
finally i can watch F1 car (V8 generation) in Bathurst
Bathurst would be so asome, insanely dangerous but awesome!  "How many DRS zones at Bathurst?" - "yes"
Forza horizon vibes
We need a race in Mount Panorama.
Again a great movie by rbr! Love it daniel is such a cool fella.
Welcome home honey badger!
That was mint !! On ya Red Bull and all the crew !!
SVG isn’t Australian though
Max may be the championship, but Daniel is the real entertainer both on the grid and the daily life
It only missed Mark Webber
Action 10/10 Creativity 10/10 DR back in a Red Bull 10/10 Acting  3/10  😛
Oh man poor race car, the dust is killing it.
Petition to put Daniel in one of the red bulls in Fp1 in Australia 🇦🇺
This looks like Crew 2 IRL
No offence Albert Park, but we should be racing at Bathurst. F1 should be at Mt Panorama.
Very cool. Should have talked the South Australian government into a lap around Adelaide though. Best street circuit I ever saw
And tge RB7 never ran again because of all the melted silica in inside the car 😅
kick perez out and get ric back
Danny is baaaaackkk!!!!!!!
0:21 I don't believe it. Danny is actually driving this year's McLaren after all!
glad daniel found a seat at ferrari
😲👋👊🏻💯🎥🎬🌠🌟✨🎞️🤩wow that’s amazing how’s cool is that
Liam Lawson did a good job filling in to DR
gota say daniel at red bull, never gets old
Brilliant video. Domating the championship and have time to make this masterpiece. Incredible.
That RB7 is gorgeous!
I love Chucky with all my heart.
sensational😍😍😍
I have no idea how they ran an RB7 and a stunt plane in my backyard without me knowing.
Why was everyone talking like that?! Haha
Need the BTS to this one..!! Love it… RBR ❤
Good to see him back in the car
The clip is just missing the Men at Work
Great Driving Liam Lawson 😊
What an insane video!! 😂 driving an F1 car through all of that!  Epic Production!! DR is a Legend. 🔥🔥🤘🏻🤘🏻
Scored as many points on holiday as Mclaren have . Welcome back DR
I love you all even when except for Daniel you can't act even if your lives depended on it. Still, lovely.
Awesome
Ricardo used to actually race with Max instead of some second drivers, that just ask that they can pass himm
This is a great vid, but how dumb do u think ppl are? It’s obviously not Danny Ric doing the driving.
AYYY another awesome video and what a lovely sight seeing Ricci back!
Broken Hill is not Silverton. Silverton is around 15 mins north of broken hill and is a ghost town..
👌👌👌👌👌
Sorry guys.. really cringy 😖
I’ve been wanting to see an F1 car around Bathurst since a very long time. I’m so glad I finally got to! Way to go Red Bull! 👌
this was actually emotional seeing that Number 3 again and daniel back at home...thankyou 😢😢🤘🤘
I wonder if this video affects the budget cap.
show more mt panorama video, surly he did more than one lap?
This felt like a Forza 6 Red Bull Outback Edition trailer!
Epic! See ya’z in Melbourne!
Oohhhhhh danielll riccciarrrrrdoooooooo Hey!
Legend
Hoping we get back some of that old school content that we used to love too!! The ones with Daniel and Max goofing round, they were lower budget and much simpler but they were the most loved!
Danny Ric didn’t even spend 1min in the car for this promo!! Liam Lawson the entire time, false advertising !
Bloody brilliant 👏
Finnaly, Daniel Ricciardo, the RB9 reserve driver ladys and gents🥳🙌🙌
Haha I am gonna collect some dirt and put it in Leclerc's eyes 👀
That’s the most media-compliant you’ll see SVG all year.
Glad to see Daniel back
Even though it’s only a reserve driver role, still happy thst DaniRic’s back.
Cool.
Daniel 🎉🎉
One of the best videos i have seen 😊
Great to see D3 and RB7 back..what an insane video!!!
The Crew  Vibes lol
it's not Daniel driving
DANIEL YOU ARE A ICONIC AUSTRALIAN ! GO YOU GOOD THING !!! MICHAEL IN MELBOURNE 👍❤️🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
Other teams: Spend carefully every penny to develop their cars Red Bull: F1 in desert go brrrrr
Superb!
The driver of the RB7 at Bathurst was actually Liam Lawson, not Ricciardo….
Give him the second seat in RB already. Haha.
This is why DR is back at Redbull
Imagine the amount of air filters they went through
Now that's an Aussie RedBull Road Trip 🇦🇺!!!
dani in the rb is the best thing there is
Clearly not DR3 driving. Liam Lawson was in the car at Bathurst at the very least. Clearly why the helmet stayed on all video 😂
can we have another chassis than RB7?
So stupid we can't have F1 at Bathurst. It's beyond me how it is only a FIA grade 3 track. Some of these new street circuits in F1 these days look far more dangerous than Bathurst, yet they get Grade 1 ratings. Guess it's all about how much oil money you can pay out.
this is forza horizon 3 but irl...
Sick!
Miss you DR3 ❤
Only Red Bull can pull off such incredible things....
Good to see him in an redbull again, even if its an old car. Only redbull does such fun things like this with f1 cars and its why we love them, good to hear that high RPM v8 again and welcome back Danny.
Whether you like their F1 team or not, you gotta admit that they have by far the best marketing projects!
Cheesy, bad acting. But totally awesome. Well done.
What an amazing video wow. Goosebumps Australia is beautiful
Teasing us with real engine sounds. The good old days.
Checo out, Daniel in please🎉
So happy for Daniel 😌
Daniel went from being a Grand Prix winner to being relegated to Red Bull’s glorified marketing mascot in about five years, purely out of his own career choices. It’s gotta hurt seeing Checo and Max getting poles and wins in one of the most dominant cars in F1 history while he’s stuck doing sim work. Bet that’s not what he imagined when he decided to leave for Renault.
I like that they show Daniel behind the wheel of a McLaren at the beginning. 😄
"Just like he never left"  Daniel: I never left
Great to see Daniel❤❤❤ maybe one race he could replace max 🤣🤣 as a punishment for Max ignoring his teammates 🤣
Good to see the love between Daniel and RB is still there.
That was more cheese then fondue 🫕
Hey daniel we are driving in australia this week, we need to test the car. Takes out the 2010 redbull. That should be sufficient data!😂😂
Isn’t this Liam Lawson driving
Except Daniel wasn’t in any of these scenes driving. All Liam Lawson
"Not bad for a Number 3 Driver!"
Haha this felt like a forza horizon showcase missions 😂
My god I feel for the team having to cope with all that dust going into the intake.
I am glad hannah gets some attention. It's always the drivers in the spotlights while she is equally important to the team.
WELL DONE REDBULL  ANOTHER BANGER VIDEO!!!!
ha ha ha made my day cheers DR RB!
this actually feels like a teaser for the new the crew game😂😂
At least the tyres were ready. 🤣
Pity that Liam Lawson was driving as well
Danny Ric should never have left, hope he takes Perezs seat. Nothing against Checo, but he ain't no Danny Ric.
Love to see Danny back at RB!! But uh, Danny started with RB with the RB10 right? Why the RB7 here?
Loved the cheeky little inclusion of Jamie Whincup ;)
Hay Daniel, hay like ❤
This is awesome to see Daniel back at Red Bull Racing 🙌🏽👏🏽👏🏽
it was liam lawson at bathurst lmaoo 💀
It'd be great if Daniel could get a test at a current track in last year's car to give him a reference point against the McLaren as well as Max and Checo. Drivers don't just lose their talent. There were peculiarities with the McLaren's handling that didn't suit his style. I'm convinced that he'd be quick again in a better car, and he deserves a chance to show it.
If he can be happy being a ‘number 2 driver’ at Red Bull, then he could be prime to jump into Checos spot after his eventual fallout from the battle with Max this season.
Would be crazy if this released in a world where Daniel took the wheel this weekend for RedBull 2023...
Just loved it........ Welcome home Daniel....
リザーブドライバーでもいいと思う。
The good son returns home! Be very happy at Red Bull, Daniel! 💪🤠
It's so cool to see Daniel again !!! He's so smiling!
Welcome back Daniel! 😍😍
Danny Boy already having loads more fun as a reserve driver for RB
7/11 a new Red Bull sponsor?!
Goosebumps!
Please give this man some track time in Vegas free practice!!!
Is this Forza horizon 6 trailler? love it
How good was this? haha well done team! Glad you could get that bitumen-based RB7 dusty 💨
Loved the video. Glad Danny is back at Red Bull & being as entertaining as always. Just wish u guys had sent him to Bathurst to actually drive the car there… having watched the Bathurst 12hr race, I’m well aware he didn’t drive the car. Feel like u really missed the ball on that one.  But as I said, loved it anyway. The world needs more DanRic
Hannah my luv 😍❤️ Dakota Johnson of F1
Fair dinkum, we bloody love this! 🇦🇺🦘
Best video ever! period!!
Nice work guys :)
bloody awesome red bull  luv it !  keep it coming
That tractor is mclaren
Noone does it like the redbull boys! Great job once again!
6:42, ah yes, Car-meet heaven, 7/11
Red Bull doing Red Bull things.
Idk if anyone is like this, but i kinda hope that checo or max is unable to drive so we can see him. 🥺
Now this is how is should be.
Great acting
He BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!
More like Daniel Craig 😉  Woop woop  Aussie Oscar   What a beauty
Danny is home ❤️
Written by a 9 year old Red Bull employee, apparently 😂
seeing daniel in RB just feels so natural
Suppose Daniel should do *something* for the millions he's earning for not driving.
Gizzy and Ricciardo on the same track my heart can’t take it still wish Daniel was racing too 😭 😭 ❤️
I have a question: The car in the video is a RB7 which means it had a Renault engine back in the days. I read that after a season teams have to give back the engines to the manufactors. So I am wondering what kind of enigne do you have in it? You're proably not allowed to put the current one in either?
So great to see Daniel behind RB again!
Congratulations Danielle im so proud of you that my wiper fluid leaked 😂 you definitely deserve it 🎉 bravo🎉
Even though he’s just a reserve driver, he belongs back in Red Bull. So awesome
I wish F1 cars would be in Forza Horizon
Damn this was so cool (and expensive) haha! Love it! Budget cap crying at the moment haha
Aw man seeing a v8 n a f1 on the mountain would have been amazing.  Wish I was there
You're missing out on nothing Ric! 18 mil to *NOT* drive a shitbox Mac-and-cheese-Laren! Red Bull ribeye steak all the way mate.
He's probably faster with the old RB car on wet tires driving on sand than McLaren now on any tracks. 😂
Build another car, give it Daniel and let them all three RACE! Not advantage to anyone, just their skill and the best car in the grid. No kings, nor crybabies, just a true champion, no fakes allowed!
Nice driving Liam
If only RB could have somehow managed(IK calendar clashes) to get Jack Miller from RB Factory KTM this would've been just perfect seeing how he's an Aussie too.
now that's a job! who needs to be in f1 grid if you're having this much fun 😁
Nice placement of broken Hill 🤣 don't remember it being down on the border of Victoria
Welcome back Daniel!
Good PR.
f1 car on panorama. what a view
Cringey..
Jajaja el tractor color McLaren 🤣
We need more Daniel videos!
this is the perfect use of DR as a reserve driver. Well done
Danny boiii is back lesgooo
Redbull always amazing
What a fun video. 🏎
is this the first time an f1 car has been on mount panorama ?
Drop Bears are not Koala's..... They are much more blood thirsty.
WELCOME BACK Daniel❤❤❤❤
Am I only one that can’t stand the bad acting and dumbass videos?  I wish Red Bull with hire a normal advertising agency instead of this trash
Damn it! I live in Bathurst
I can't be the only one who desperately wants to see the behind the scenes on this!!
Is that actually Daniel in the car or just doing a voiceover?
Would love to see SVG have a go in one of those.
i loved to see NAME ON THE CAR STILL. Hope he runs in f1 again ....
Funny clip.  Welcome home Danny and give em hell at Albert Park in the Red Bull.
The acting is really solid here. 👍
Nice driving by Liam Lawson
Great, great, video. It's an enormous effort and an amazing video.  Now we need a Maxiel content. You could include Checo as well, if you want :D
Great to have Danny back at RB!!! However.... that is an RB7, from 2011...... Just saying. But GREAT to see Dan back!!!!!
Bet that RB7 handles better then that MCL36 he drove last year…
Hannah Schmitz ... cool headed tactical mastermind ... and Oscar Award deserving actress. What a gem. :)  Oh and Daniel is cool too.
How good is this mate! haha
The sound on the old cars, I miss it!! So good to See Dani Ric
Daniel Ricciardo 🤠🏎💨🔥
Red Bull know how to put a show :)
레드불 시트에 앉은 다니엘을 다시 볼 수 있어서 기뻐! 언제나 널 응원해 다니엘:-)
Most fun I'e had on youtube for weeks! This was awesome, thanks. :)
It was really sporting of them to show DR in the Mclaren at the beginning   I'd watch a season of this over DTS
Time for a shoey 😊
makes me sooo damn happy... let's hope danny will get a chance to fly some laps in australian Grand Prix....
Danny ric in the element Yeehaw~
Daniel has the BEST job now!! How much fun!!!
He sure is having more fun than being in a mclaren this year
Drop bears or as they are scientifically named, Thylarctos Plummetus, are a real problem in outback Australia, their savagery knows no bounds.
Damn, i miss that engine sound
They forgot the bit where he hits a roo on the way to Melbourne, totals the car, and the roo hops off like nothing happened.
That bridge is spectacular
MORE ASAPPPPP
That was cool as, sooooo soooooo bad lol
You'll never see Ferrari or Mercedes do this stuff with their F1 cars
Love this so much. Put him in the new car. Get max out
cringe
The car looks weird without Halo, I know it's the old spec but still.
Please don't turn Daniel into David..
Glad and sad to see Dani Ric in Red Bull colors. Here's hoping for a permanent seat sometimes later.
This videos are the coolest F1 content out there, but the dialogues are so painfully cringe.
Red Bull are geniuses to have Dan back on board, he is a marketing delight for the team. Everyone loves Dan, you can see how happy he is to be back with RB, be it a reserve driver or doing other things.
This made me so happy to see Danny back omg
More Daniel driving please
This is why I love Red Bull racing! I miss seeing Daniel on the grid, but I’m very happy he’s back with Red Bull!
F1 just isn't the same without seeing Mr Daniel Riccardo 🇦🇺
I miss Daniel Ricardo
sick as!
So happy he's back at redbull !
The “honey badger” is back!
It’s awesome to see Daniel back at Red Bull. Welcome home mate!
I'm a simple man, really. I see a happy Daniel, I'm happy too.
Now we know the real reason DR is back with RB, to make vids just like this! I just truly hope he is happy and doing what he wants to do. And I feel like this is perfect for him
So what was the F1 cars lap time?
Mount Panorama has to be on the F1 calendar.
upload full onboard from mouth panorama please...
Bro why does he have a f1 car in his shed 💀
If this is why y'all brought back Daniel, bravo 👏🏾
It's always happy to see content related to danny ric. Thank you, Red Bull. You guys literally made my day 🥺🫶🏻
Been waiting for this!
He's so priviledged, keep on pushing family, loyalty!  O, wait ... this is an actual fun video.
Danny ric and red bull are a match made in heaven 💓
Wow!!!
Danny, please do another series!  Indycar would  gladly welcome you. Go for the triple crown! We believe!
Jack Miller was missing in this video
Wasn't that the same bridge in Forza Horizon 3?
Very kind of redbull to show Daniel in the McLaren at the start of the vid
The "acting" is really on par....🙄
Yeah nar this way sick aye
Pretty cool but still not a Dan fan
legendary!! 🤘🏼🤘🏼
Not to bash McLaren but what happened to letting Daniel take an f1 McLaren car around Bathurst if he won a race???
Just realised that redbull have numbers 1, 3, 33 and 11.
Liam Lawson was doing all the driving wasn't he
Ha ha! What great fun video! Epic stuff!
It’s Liam Lawson
Daniel, you rock!!!!!
I don't know how you have an F1 team if you can't put a 17-year-old in his place
Now announce an F1 race around Bathurst 😂
2:57 cricket let's go
Why so cringe...can't they just make it without the cringe these days
Image daniel going for an actual hotlap around bathurst :0
I can't  be the only one that thinks this is awesome
Dear Mercedes fans: marketing is NOT part of the catering budget, lolz 😂
Danny Boy!!! 🤙🏻🤙🏻
Truly back where he belongs 🥹 Welcome home, mate!
this reminds me of ubisofts scripted multiplayer trailers.
All his career decisions were wrong.
It’s so nice to see him back at Red Bull
Well, at least this guy can still claim himself as a F1 car driver outside track. And I think he is doing a better job at entertaining ppl rather than racing on the track. Good job!
Daniel needs a Red Bull race seat for next year.😀
Wow!
He's definitely not in that car for 90% of the video
Hannah!!!😍
We need much more Danny Ric on our TV's.
Ricciardo is and will always be a joke.
DR3🤘😛
SO GOOD SEEING DANNY RIC BACK IN THE RED BULL. SERIOUS CHILLS
Not as good as checos run to Miami but ok I suppose
Dan Ric you are a legendary ambassador
F1 at Bathurst and Daniel can't get any better than that
Let’s go Daniel! Hope to see you at the Melbourne Gp this weekend! :) Welxome back to red Bull!
damn, how wild would mt panaramo be as an f1 track. it would be carnage but there'd be some really good racing if they made it a bit wider.
That poor sales girl... Her smile turned into pain as Dani left the watch store... I feel bad for her... 😟😟😟
Absolute Banger again from the best Team on the Grid and off the Grid! Welcome Home Danny we missed u!!
Look how they massacred my boy T_T
So glad DC3 is back at Red Bull. 🔥🔥
RB pit crew are the charm of the show❤
Thankyou RedBull for being the only ones ballsy enough to give us these awesome videos, and for showing the world this beautiful country us Aussies call home, bring on Thursday-Sunday Welcome back Daniel and RedBull to the lucky country 🏎️🐂🤙🏻🇦🇺🦘
to be honest, I rather be a reserve driver if it got me behind the wheel of a v10 F1 !
Proper RED BULL style crazy driving ...DANIEL is like cherry on cake ....AWESOME AWESOME 💯💥💥💥
Will Daniel Ricciardo be the man to drive an F1 car upside down?
That was utterly, utterly awesome, very well put together and great to highlight the magic Aussie country and some of its stars. Great to see Dan back in the RB colours with a real smile back on his face. Let’s hope that RB put him into FP1 for Melbourne to take advantage of the fan power that the boy has, the “DanFans” will go nuts. Now that the’ve got him back, I hope RB have the sense to put him into that second seat to show that he has still got it, after the 2 years of driving a rubbish car.
That helmet 😍
Red Bull just do it Differently
I’m so happy to see Danny back!!🤩🥰
Hope he gets to drive the RB19 in practice
Just a reminder that Daniel has the same amount of championship points as Norris and Piastri combined!
Daniel >>> Checo
Nice!
Awesome seeing him back in Redbull colours! Definitely seems right and brings back great memories!
Good to see Daniel back with Red Bull, where he belongs !
Yeaaah booooi!
Can we have his merch uniform tee at least? Would love to wear his numbers again!!
this Red Bull video screams Forza Horizon  Forza Horizon 6 : Australia + Red Bull sports squad DLC
It’s a tough job but somebody’s got to do it!😁
This was more fun than first two f1 races this year😅
I mean this is pretty cool but Daniel wasn't actually driving in any of these clips, it was all Liam Lawson.
Toby Price - Dakar Winner not just an off-road racer
Welcome home Danny Ric. This makes me as happy as watching McLaren this year. 😂
There are teams in F1 who doesn't have budget for upgrading their cars and here is Red bull spending millions for cinematic experiences
what a host...
SO THIS IS WHAT THE LADS BEEN UP TO 😂😂
Red bull here doing cinematic masterpieces as side missions.
Oscar winning acting going on here! But seriously, good to see DannyRic back in action!!
How good is this! Great work team
If you can drive there, Daniel will drive there
great to see such a fun ad with all the red bull team mates having fun.
Welcome back danny ric
Danny Ric is back in RB overalls!!!!!!!!
Sad they kinda stuffed up the geography lesson here. Sydney was where Coffs Harbour is.
red bulls target audience seems to be 11 year old boys…
Se divierte el Dani, un picaro
It wasn't even Ricciardo, he wasn't even in the country
Mad Shed Skid!
Welcome back Daniel 🏁🏎️
its great to see at least daniel having some fun
It's good to see him again behind a ball and what better than with Red Bull ❤
Damn Redbull make great cars but my god they are bad actors
maybe i am just a sceptic but i just doubt that was Danny Ric as you never saw him except at the start  but either way it was a cool video
I absolutely love it!!! I'm so happy to see Hannah, Daniel and more ❤❤ Great video!!
honey badger suits best in only in the bull suit
Liam Lawson is the actual Reserve driver right?
Mercedes is about to drop their video; it’s Mick, sitting in a 5 star restaurant joking with Toto about which fork to use for what 😂
Love seeing Ricc back ima Red Bull! This is a great gig for him this year
Amazing work! That was awesome
Loved it and love him
I love checo but red bull better have Danny ric and Max in the car next year.
no one does marketing like redbull!! the absolute kings
Daniel got his Wings back! Epic to see him back at Redbull💪🏽 #redbullgivesyouwings #dr3
DR3 ❤️
how i missed this roadtrips from dany
I wonder if Liam Lawson had fun filming this… none of it is Danny 😂
Content we missed alot
It’s soo good to see Daniel back at Redbull and I enjoyed the video we need more videos like this with Daniel please ❤️💯
This feels right KI KI KI AY AY
Awesome 👍👍👍
Great vídeo, great movie, Beautiful Country. All we knew Daniel Ricciard is the most famous driver and person from. Australia= PERTH. We love you Daniel more and more, everyday . I personaly miss Daniel. I hope he is happy to be back in your loved hometown as a third driver.from Redbul .Thausand thanks Redbull for all.Now I happy to see Daniel again. Till next Sunday in Albert Park.🏁💕💔
Red Bull never disappoints
Daniel the movie star, with Liam Lawson as his stunt double.. Liam does all his stunts, like driving F1 cars..
He's back home bois🎉🎉🎉
ngl, nearly teared up a bit. Redemption doesn't have to look like Monaco 2018. Sometimes redemption looks like this.
❤❤❤❤❤❤super Daniel Ricciardo
Need f1 race at Bathurst ffs!
no jump at the chase?
my mans back
I am actualy more excited about the Hanna Schmitz cameo ❤
Liam Lawson was driving this, mad respect to him. Shame he got 0 credit considering Danny Ric wasn't even there lmao.
more Danny PLEASE !!!
What will it take for Danny to race Bathurst 1000, imagine him being co drivers with SVG. Please Red Bull make this happen
F1 should race on bathurst!!!
What a legendary vid .. well done to the RB guys and welcome back Daniel!
Praying for Max Verstappen to get food poisoned again so Danny can fill in🙏
Forza horizon 6
this is great XD
リカルドもヘルメットをアライからシューベルトに変えたんだ・・・
Daniel switches to Schuberth helmet?
Good, clean fun. Thanks guys.
The RB7 just reminds me of Seb.
Goosebumps seeing Daniel back in RB colours!!!
Total gold. Red Bull at its best .. and cool to see him at Bathurst with the Giz
best f1 team
Absolute madness road trip by Red bull team. Magnificent!
I'm not crying, you are.
Danny Ricciardo back at Red Bull (as a reserve driver) is definitely one of his greatest career moves
Yeah! DR!
No se porque el cara de camello siempre se quiere hacer el gracioso.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Red Bull Racing 😍💜
So, Danny is the new Coulthard?
If this doesn’t make you proud to be Aussie don’t even talk to me
Genial 👍  En verdad me alegra ver a Daniel Ric montado nuevamente en un monoplaza de RedBull  🥹
It's great to see Daniel in action
LOVED IT!! If only Albert Park was as interesting a track as Mt Panorama.
Riccardo and Webber Colab when?
The content we need!!! DR3 back in RB! 🔥🔥🔥🍯🦡
This was awesome, made me a very proud Aussie.
Danny Ric gets paid 18 million this year to chill
i can't believe he was so close to me being in sydney city and mount panorama. He is an absolute legend and this video was absolutely awesome
And this is wy i love Red Bull......no F1 team is nuts to do these thinks....
This feels so right!
WELCOME BACK DANIEL!!
Nice to see DR having fun for a bit, bet he doesn't regret not driving a "Sh@tbox' McLaren this year and getting paid for it  🤣🤣🤣
I am so glad Daniel  is back with Red Bull!!!
Clowncciardo doing his job💪💪💪
Incredible cinematography
RedHkana?
Welcome back, Daniel! 🇦🇺
Hannah Schmitz ❤❤❤
Why doesn't Mercedes do this type of stuff 🥲
Increíble, que joya es volver a ver a Dany con RB!!
Yeaaaaaahhhhh.....
Simply lovely
Give Danny Ric a free practice session to prove everyone wrong
So nice to see Dani ric 😁😁😁
The RB7 sounds so good
Danny is the new DC
