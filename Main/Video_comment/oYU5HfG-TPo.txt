Imagine scumbagging the Audi museum
Als ich die Masken gesehen hatte, wollte ich schon gar nicht mehr weiterschauen.
Rip buddy. The world misses you so much.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥😍
Latvijā arī divi braucēji un dzeltenām audi ļoti labi!
Quando entra nel garage, Ken sembra un bimbo in un negozio di caramelle....
RIP Ken Block
Rip Ken!
Super labombastic fantastic skolastic🦀🎼🚀🤽🌜🏊🚣🏄🪂💪🧭🎸⚙️🧠🚦⛽🫁🫀🐳😍🥰💘🤿💯✈️⚓🤘👏🌞🙏😇🐬👀👍💋
Lovely car wow you didn’t really open her up
Rip Ken block
This man took a 40 year old relic and said “Yo lemme try this rq”
It's a crying shame that we didn't get to see the payoff of the Audi and Ken Relationship. RIP 43.
We miss you Ken! How is 3 years ago!
...  MANCHING Air Base  ... 😐‼
Miss you Ken 😢
A------mazing!!!!!!
Sad they didnt go film the other legendary cars from Le Mans, IMSA, and Endurance racing disciplines..then again Ken was a rally driver/stunt dude
So awesome but I love Mr block’s humbleness and respect that he and his team has. An absolute lunatic behind the wheel but total gentleman otherwise. I bet the lord tells Ken every day smooth does it!!
So sick!!!!
ken just usually drifting an audi s1 with sunglasses
I cant believe what I'm seeing.
1:12 sarà sempre l'Audi più bella del mondo
Oh look back when hunegan was still good and wasn't weighed down by corporate And pretty much everyone left
F4 phantommmmmm. Nah im joking
Gr S
R.I.P Ken Block 🕊️🕊️🕊️♥️♥️♥️
Tha fact that s1 was the worst handling of the bunch, makes me respect Walter even more
an says the car is de-tuned and 30 seconds we see the sam e"de-tuned " car going fast as hell. Don't even want to imagine how fast it would be if it would have been perfectly tuned
Rip43#
Ken driving these majestic cars, mad props to Audi. Awesome
Haven't been able to come watch videos with him in it til now.
whow if your ken block, it opens cool doors!!!
goosebumps every time i watch this
Getting to drive the group S quattro is like one of the most prestigious things Audi can give you the privilege to drive. That or one of the 16cyl auto union Grand Prix cars. ❤
I got very good wallpapers form the spots 8:33 and 8:35, 14:34 and 14:41.
When you realize its teemu the WRC driver🫡😅😅
He has been and always will be a role model. I know he's doing crazy shit in heaven and having a good time. He's always in our hearts. Ken, you will be missed by millions. You've touched our hearts and changed peoples lives forever. Thank you.
RIP TO A LEGEND still rewatching in 2023🎉😢
Squared Car even Ken's having a tough time getting sideways 😎💪😂
Love how there's a R18 just standing there menacingly
RIP
Big like  audi  quattro sport 1985 is a rocket
I turned on Youtube subtitles whilst watching the video. When the engine is singing I got "Applause" as subtitle and then "Music" few seconds later. Can't argue with that :D
I don't think any car can beat the sound of Quattro S1E2
Imagine a this vs that of these two cars
Rest in peace legend! You will be missed!
At least we now know where the 3rd rs002 is
Zzzzzzututututututuu
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I can’t keep my eyes off the Audi Sport Quattro S1, I raced with it on FH5. What a Rally Monster! RIP Ken😒
I wish Ken was here and all these cars were lost In snow…
Ken Block wasn't even allowed to drift with the s1, he got really stressed after that
SWEET and they can keep the EV
😲😲😲at 6.02 mins
😲a mid engine audi quattro super car .yikes wish audi heritage would build it 👍
And not long since then poor ken block sadly passed away 😢 .R I P  man 👍
ken block has some balls to drive a super fast group b car
RIP Ken Block.
Ok ok ill happily clean this place for a daily job til retirement
epic
Love u Ken
6:06 Ken's reaction lol
I am so happy for this opportunity RIP brother and than you for those who  made this happen for him!
antes de irse visito quiza la coleccion de ensueño del rally RIP BLOCK :(
I didn't know anything about Ken Block, only seen some videos of him drifting around with some weird cars. Then I watched a video of him and his daughter, her first experiments with race cars, their beautiful relationship, etc, and I really started to like that guy. It's so sad he died. What a wonderful person.
Добро Кен !!! 😋🙏👍
Just seen this video r.i p.
What an amazing place and to see Ken so excited like a kid in a sweet shop what a truly genuine person RIP Ken
It hurt my heart that KB43 is gone..I can't imagine what the family is going through..God Bless his family loved one's & friends.
RIP RIP you will be missed....Great one.
I wish Scotto had got to drive the cars also.
It’s so nice to see how genuine Ken is. I’m really going to miss that about him. His excitement and expression about driving those cars would be how any of us would react to someone letting us drive our dream cars. I just love Ken’s personality.
Pretty sure they forgot to de-tune the second car
La increíble reacción de Ken al ver estas joyas del rally como un niño en una jugueteria, no tiene precio. Hasta pronto hermano #KB43VER 💚
Cute mask on the Germans. Went from the holocaust to masking up to avoid the common cold 😂
Such a loss to humanity never mind motorsport... RIP Ken
RIP Ken what a loss
Miss u Ken - sad that we never met - LOVE from Hamburg - DE
R.I.P. my Block dude🙏👏👏👏🤯👍
In his memory, the number 43 is stuck to the front right and rear left of my car... and it will stay that way...!
Lia, your father was amazing.
Such a shame unreal. Rip
Is it me or does Timo look really uncomfortable whilst Ken is driving those amazing cars round the track
RIP ken block
Well he will not drive that anymore i guess
Rest In Peace Ken. you will be missed
MASK...hahahaaaa !!!!
Rips Ken blook
RIP ❤
RIP  brother , gunna miss your badass driving.
Nice to see the legend drive the legend
Such an awesome but sad video. It's cool to see someone live their car dream.
I think this is what kens heaven looks like. Hope u are there with all keys now. Rip ❤
I think this is what kens heaven looks like. Hope u are there with all keys now. Rip ❤
ken driving his dream rally car, just a wholesome moment. rip legend.
RIP legend ❤
rips ))
What a good guy
RIP you massive legend.
Rest in Peace 🙏❤️
The magic that could have been with Audi. He would have made electric cars exciting for gear heads
He will be in our hearts as the king of drifting👑 and it was way to early to go, R.I.P Ken Block
R.i.P. Ken 🙏😢
😪#43! Kudos to FIA for retireing #43 ! R.I.P. Ken 🤟
Audi Tradition was a long due option .. all owners of older audis were + are really struggling with getting replacement parts. at some point audi just went "unavailable without replacement" for almost all parts of cars exactly from 1980 on where the quattro hype started. all around the 5 cylinder engines and rallye + transam (audi 200 quattro transam..) Just told owners who wanted to keep their cars going above 20 years  in a nice state to go eff yourself , we dont care.  The only real car museums are the ones driving them and fixing them. It's a car, not a painting.
Amazing- all credit to Audi Tradition.
R.I.P Legend
Rest in peace, @Ken Block !
Rest in Peace bro. You will never be forgotten
RIP Ken, great memories
RIP Brother :(
Literally rewatched this video just to see the childish grin when he first walked in and immediately came face to face with one of the most iconic group b legends. Ken was and still is awesome. Rip Ken block
Was a lot more than 300hp, closer to 600hp. These things were beasts.
Ken you're a legend...but your mate just never seems to STFU
So sad yet another brilliant driver lost RIP KEN 🚔🚖
He give us so much pleasur 👍
So tragic my deepest condolences go to his family and friends especially his young daughter Lia her and her dad seemed so close but you know what this man lived his life not only to the fullest but he lived it his way how he wanted most people couldn’t say the same and he passed doing something he loved… rip Ken
😢😢😢😢
That Audi 50 is sweet, reminds me of my dad's stories about his red Audi 50 with Porsche engine where he told me that he kept chasing this Porsche 911 in the early late 70s/early 80s on the German Autobahn and kept flashing his headlights at him to annoy him. 😂
Rip kb
rest in peace big man
😔
ło baben benc tego typu
Pinnacle of dreams and Ken got to run the tires of these two pretty much priceless cars . I remember when this video dropped all I did was smile and laugh watching the man living  his dream .
Died at age 55
Rip
I can't watch these videos anymore 😥😥😥 ......R.I.P Ken..
RIP
Rest in peace legend
FUCK 2023, R.I.P Ken block!
R.I.P. Ken Block #hoonitforken
Rip
R.I.P Ken Block
This video makes me so happy, although it’s bittersweet watching it now. Not only is it cool to see Ken and his childlike excitement over these cars but it makes me happy to see these amazing machines doing what they were meant to do, going fast. RIP Ken Block
RIP
I'm glad Ken had the opportunity to drive the S1 before he passed. RIP, king.
R. I. P. Legend
So sad. Loved watching these videos. Ken Block was an amazing entertainer, doing wild things with legendary machinery. RIP.
Rest in Peace...
Ruhe in Frieden
RIP😒
Rip Legend
Rip drift king 👑😭
Rest in peace ken 💔
MAN I WISH I KNEW HE WAS THERE I WOULD HAVE MADE A BREAK AND RUSH TO HIM TO GET A PHOTO 😢 R.I.P
R.I.P Ken he’s died in a snowmobile accident 😢😢😢
So sad to see this in the year 2023 😢
RIP to LEGEND!
Rest In Peace Ken, absolute legend
RIP ken, drift it big up there
There will never be another one like him. Gonna miss you, wildman!
RIP Ken JAN 02 '23, at least he got the chance to drive these two group b era monsters before he passed. It is sad that one of the most influential individuals involved in bringing awareness to rally motorsport is gone.
Rest in Paradise Ken Block 💐 🕊️ 🙏🏾  watch over Lia and your family !!!
The thumbnail is wrong; the Priceless Legend and One of One Prototype was Ken 😭😭😭😭 RIP HHIC 💔💔💔
Rally is so fucking based.
lucky mfker, i am jelly as fuck.
never seen ken speechless and he's been speechless like 3 times before being in the car
1:53 Bro is fflabbergasted💀
I did a five year Audi apprenticeship respect to ken I think he loves them too and nice to see his respect for the early wrc cars.
hooligan got roots!....i had no idea he is an AUDI afficianato.....cool
Oof. Be very careful with that hand posturing at 0:55 while you're in Germany 😂 could end up getting arrested.
stuck and EV in a video any chance you get
Siendo un niño, todavia recuerdo "espiar" el parque de servicio de Audi en Chateau Carreras, durante el Rally de Argentina en 1986. Se sacudia el aire el piso, te quitaba el aire. Todo ese ruido ensordecedor, casi aterrador. Siempre voy a amar esa epoca de rally. Una locura.
Awesome, what beast that Quattro is - but that souless piece of robot at the end? Nah!
Thanks Ken. Memories of standing on a rainy dirt road in the Kielder forest as that car flew past me so close I could have touch it,
I don't know anything about rallying, but I bet this guy has won dozens of World Rally Championships
How about a S1 replica for Ken to do His stunts in. That engine is Just 🤑
"They wouldn't let me do donuts." Genuine loss in Ken's tone.
Goosebumps!
WHO is this man? Never heard from him
1:52 Christmas came early
German dude tryin to mold in the convo lol
It was really Mr. Block.... Damn.... First i hear the Cars then in was watching. Greedz from Ingolstadt
LUSH
Wtf was the point of the masks lmao… smh.
they so scared they brought Ken a brand new car to rip up in stead lol
Watching Ken like a kid on Xmas morning… priceless! Feel bad for Brian because he really is an Audi nerd
So lucky. Avagud1
i never liked ken block cause he’s a subaru guy   now he’s pretending to be a audi lover 😆
woaOOOOOOOOOOOO00000
why lay stupid annoying music over this glorious engine noise. so American..
Amazing
AUDI <333
It´s always nice to see such cars in action. It would be a shame to just let them catch dust in a garage or museum.  But I think the cars weren´t at the limit. It´s understandable because they are so expensive, but a little more pushing on a track would have been epic.
I had a garage some years ago, a "secret door" with no handle at the back of my garage led to a big room that was the owner of the buildings, bunch of crap and building materials etc. And a Mustang Shelby.. a bad ass quattro widebody type -dont know what kind but same body as the s1, and yeah also a s1, pretty bad shape on both quattros, but the owner was pretty sure that the s1 was a prototype, i dont remember if it was longer than the group b car or something?. cold be something to check out if there ever was prototypes for it. im pretty sure he still has them.
I just love the 5 cyl with the turbo noice.....
Think your wrong with the head space fact. Quote, There is one anomaly with Andrew’s car and that’s the windscreen’s rake. During Audi’s early efforts with the Quattro, works drivers complained that the front windscreen was prone to light glare, so the Sport Quattro versions were fitted with a shorter screen (on a more acute angle) borrowed from the Audi sedan.
Walter Röhrl Is still out there to give a lesson on gravel.... 😎😂 Walter drove in the night with massive massive fog in Arganil and was every km about 7 seconds faster then the guy on second place. That what's flow of two people can do it the don't make any mistake they don't Röhrl hasn't to see the track.
You had me at "Quattro," the F4 was just mean. :D
group s a.k.a. suicide squad
Original quattro sound - like Immigrant Song from Led Zeppelin! Love through the centuries!
Thats my dream.
I dont think ive ever got a legitimate chubby watching any car video until now.
The 002 looks like the car you drew as a kid, it's awesome!
I hope you're gonna have a go at the pikes peak record in an Audi Etron real soon Ken. .
It is dangerous to give such a legendary car to a person who did nothing but crash in every race xD
Love 💕   Fucking amazing
E Tron just sounds so sad.
AUDILIFE
I don't know if they do.... but if they don't.  They should for sure but these cars in rotation at the Goodwood festival. 💦💦
That S1 Quattro has to be detuned because I’ve seen this thing in person by Beres (Czech rally driver) and it is ridiculously fast.  😊
THAT WAS SUPER SICK
I laughed my as off at *sabelt*
Not to be rude but I am not a fan of Brian in the Hoonigan videos
Ive seen videos of this being driven gently at tracks just to honor the car but ken doesnt care he is driving it how it should be
Oh the sound of five cylinders! Is mint!
Like a kid at the candy store! 🙌
Congrats monster team u guys are crazy I love it ..you should go to scumbagging the Mercedes or porche museums jajaja
It means that this cars were built like a tank. Insane!
Wow! Just wow!
Junge das darf nicht jeder
With his massive crash record i would not let him drive even a shopping cart. :D
Just check 'Group B - the sound' and enjoy the cars in their heyday: you'll also see driving skills on a whole new level in comparison with Block.
How on earth did Audi let Block loose in their collection.  He's not even a minor rally driver - he's a complete non-entity.
Audi lost so much respect of this video. Where the European deal is?? WTF. Just sell off and see what you do.
I like how they gloss over the line of r18s in the background
The absolute loser in rallies thinks he is Michele Mouton
The six lights on the front are so sick.
That 5 cyl sound 😍
Köyhä..
would love to see him get his hands on an aston martin '64 db5
Damn that RS002 is so damned insane 🤯 I freaking love it 🤩
Awesome material !!!I love group B rally cars !!!
is that Timo person THE Timo Salonen? woooowww...... I love seeing the Ken's Dumbface when stared at the legendary monsters wkakakakak...soo Epic
mad respect to Audi. Keep it up
@Ken Block I designed a 1000HP 950KG Audi Quattro!!! Hoonicorn!!!! it got Superturbos
A DREAM COME TRUE!!!!!!
Ken who ????
Awesome video. However the big guy is annoying.. trying too hard to be funny
Oooooohwwww..whetties....blast m like they love IT.... thanks Audi and Ken and team;+)...... Hehehe boooommm
First American who drives a good car
Love Audis, got 2 in my driveway.  Mine has a bit more HP than my wife's (almost 3x).  LOL    Now if only she'd stop bitching about me going through tires so often.
4:00 How to NOT say Lancia 🙄
Ken should try to drift the IMSA GTO.............just kidding,      I know it´s a Crime..✌😭👍
I try to Unserstand how this Peace of Equipment build by Audi Just seems to fascinate nearly every men in this Planet.  Breath taking Car. I Go even one step further, leave the Car looking the old way, with edges and straight Lines and Just Chuck Modern tec in IT and Bring it Out with Like a 2l Turbo and a 2,5l Turbo engine. Thats it, im buy one, i even start saving now. Just please Bring it Back! And dont do it round and new so it propperly. I'll even come and Work on IT.
Kudos to audi for landing them the cars
wtf omg that S1 quattros daaaamn
I like everything but the ev.. it ain’t it all these car companies one in the same
you know you must be famous when you can clickbate with your own name before a brand like audi 😜
shit bro , its a good thing they de-tuned it , you are driving it like a drifter , constantly into the rev limiter , disrespectful and clumsy , you would not have lasted in a one on one against rohrl , these cars are not THINGS , they are works of art , if you dont know how to call them atleast dont call them things , that is so yank.
ugh , bucket please , dont be such a yank about it , you would not have survived in the group B times , not enough show for the likes of you , to much skill required .stick with Monster crap bro.
Ken looks kimi Räikkönen now
I wonder what the german guy is thinking with those almost rude americans talking endlessly.
Why is youtube recommending me a whiny second place rally racer?
ГДЕ ПЕРЕВОД БЛЯ?
Not so top secret now 😊
What is this funny tiny rally white car
Got to see his smashed up rs200 in Middlesbrough a few years ago that he’d chopped in.
He should have teamed with Lancia... he might have got to see the ECV002, the car that still makes every other 'S' car (there were several) look utterly pointless.
At the end, there is the proof that doesn't matter how much power an electric car have, it is boring. Bring back the 5 cylinders and the V8s.
The UR Quattro, the ONLY Audi I EVER wanted, and STILL want.  THIS is what a car SHOULD sound like (sorry Elon).
come to Lancia that you enjoy more
Lancia Delta HF❤️👍
You know what's crazier. Modern rally vehicles are way the fuck faster than group b.
Take that to the Nordschleife on the weekend.
It's missing a turbo , it has way to much turbo lagg now🤣.
is the legend is back or what
@Ken Block WOW that must have just been mind blowing...all the years of hard work, dedication and not being an egomaniac dickhead paid off!!! I'm a little late to the party but just wanted to say well deserved my friend...looking forward to the next video!!!
Sorry Ken, but you're not enough to S1 Quattro. You just raped that machine you do not knows on it. Watch Jozef Beres and learn to drive a real race car. it is not a personalized toy car..the audi at the end, with full of helping electronics, that's your car. You can clowning around with it
"Can I put a dog box in it first?"
1:57 golf doing audi cosplay.
the audi guy had no clue about our american jokes haha. poor guy looked clueless most of the time
Wait the car from art of rally is a real thing?
Q u a t t r o
Was it Hannu Mikkola?
5:19 Look at the DTM 2020 car in the background...
Damn this was foreshadowing
You actually saw ken blocks come face then!! Looool
Super nice 🇲🇾💖🇲🇾💖🇲🇾
At first i kinda rolled my eyes when i saw the thumbnail for this video but you can see they both really give a shit about the groupe b era/cars and that this wasnt just for views. Like i really feel like they wouldve done this without a single camera there.
The engine noises are so good.
Germans are like bring out the crayons muricans are here lol
the s1 that ken was driving was a replica but that dont mind because the real s1 e2 does not exist it was build in to the pikes peak
the sadness in they won't let me do donuts
Fair play audi !!
At first I thought these audi cars are monsters but the driver himself is more of a monster.
This isn't ken block
The steeper windscreen on the sport Quatro was because the drivers had complained about reflections in the cabin, so they replaced the windshield with one from an Audi 80.
I am literally dying of jealousy here 😵
Das ist der Traum jedes Audi - Liebhabers . ich habe das Glück einen von 992 gebauten B4 Avant 2,3 NG Quattro zu haben . Er ist hier  in Norwegen zu gelassen und Originalzustand . Muss nur noch Schönheitsoperationen machen . Der Vorbesitzer hat geschlampt ! Its a nice Car . I love it !
How many auto manufacturers would say yes to the whimsical request for a real-world comparison of their most precious museum pieces? How cool and accommodating is that Audi PR guy? I know the Hoonigans like to yuk it up, but underneath they are deadly serious race car builders and Ken Block is a world-class driver. Thanks to all the above for a video Audiphiles will treasure forever.
Fucking epic
All I can say is absolutely amazing dude like totally and undeniably awesome !!!!
In wide open spaces Ken can drive, but he does crash a lot on tight stages.....
If ya want your cars to faster than what you thought they could..stick your daughter in them lol. What a legend
🤩✌
Would have loved that  rear engine mounted audi that was in those photos... Wonder what other cars Audi would have made if they produced these ones....*long sigh*
very secret
The problem is newer cars make these cars feel like dinosaurs when you drive them, I bet Ken thought that but wouldn’t say it.
2:00 I think Ken genuinely had a moment there, so much history of race cars throughout the ages, and back to the glory days too. Amazing!
That E-tron looks like complete idiot against that S1.
WOW !!!!!
Ken now you need 5 rings 4 of These for your car and o for your wife
Timo is apparently familiar with the Ghostbusters pro-tip of "If someone asks you if Ken Block can drive your one-of-one prototypes, you say YES."
That prototype is amazing - even the slats in the grille are little airfolis! Every pound of downforce matters!
Sorry but leggend of rally and queen is Lancia.
A little cringe ah Block....
Why did scotto not drive them as well ???????
Missed a trick there should have the AUDI rings in dohnuts at the end.
Wow. Ken Block changes teams again to his "favorite" manufacturer. Again.
It amazed me more is how they preserve these cars so it runs perfectly just as it was 30 almost 40 years ago...
imagine an opportunity to drive the legendary Quatro S1 E2, but they tell you you cant drift it. Even worse they detune the car before you get in it.
Dear gods I had a ''nocturnal emissions'' in my pants when the German dude said YES! on taking the quattro out for a ride!  All I could think was '' OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!'' Oh My Fucking Gods YES!!!!!
amazing cars!
What a real car company! Love that they actually drive there museum cars!
I’m happy for Ken he didn’t roll one of those priceless museum pieces, but even happier for Audi and Timo. So cool to see the S1 in action again, one of the most successful Group B rally dream cars.
That Quatro makes me so happy.
Yeah hannu mikkola drove this thing on gravel and dirt, that was fucking insane so they had to make it illegal
<3
Frighteningly Brilliant....... Absolutely Beautiful........ Thank-you......
Ken... you lucky bastard! ;) Audi's the one and only Holy Grail ,WOW :O
nul
Either Timo lied and there is more than 1 of the group S cars or they change the license plates on them. In this video the plate is visible at 11:47 and on the video in the link it visible at 12:37. Either way I love everything about this video and wouldn't be surprised if it's just a different plate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i8u-TRwsYk
Metro 6R4 remains the beast still.
Audi heaven,I drive a A3 soft top and I just it to bits , when hubby was alive we had a coup, 80,90 and best of all turbo quott,it was a lovely beast❤️🦂
🤘💪👍💥
Alot of kids who don't know about OG rally cars didn't think they were actually fast..... They were actually FXCKN fast! 😆
Can you do a bmw collab?  Would be amazing
everytime the audi guy was about to talk you guys cut him off LOOOOL
This is the Holy Gral for Rallye fans!
Ken literally just checked a bucket list item off for Rally fans all over the world. Thanks for taking us all along for the ride.  Keep your wheels down and thumbs up my friend. Great video and please do more with Audi legendary machines 👍
Just imagine a Audi S1 with middle engine!
Get Audi back into WRC!
This...
Detuned?! Wtf?? 😀
I'm kind of interested in knowing who the five people are that have driven the Group S proto before Ken :o.
Love Ken love to be in the passenger seat while he drifting such a beast rally driver
Hey Ken, just to be clear. I was a die hard Colin McRae fan but when I see your face in the location (oh I remember my face in the Porsche Museum when they opened or later had Sound Nights) I have to give you bonus points for Charisma ;)
u need to build a gymkana s1
A~Mazing, doing it right!
i will never go home , i m home
I'm genuinely more interested in Audi as a brand/automaker after watching this series. I just wish I could afford anything they make.
Bad news to all ! Put your sound to zero and you`ll enjoy the future..
Poor timo must have been schisering in his leiderhosen
You silly kraut car making Germans you forget LANCIER had the longest success in rally car racing also fast forward today you forget Subaru will win and continue also they have the most loyal following and more perks for there owners but live on your past
8:36 That airport is closer to Munich than Inglostadt, they deadass stepping on BMWs turf
ken pausing and saying they wouldn't let him do donuts is just priceless!
Looks so weird without the beard
It's funny how the possibly meanest, most dangerous and fastest Audi rally car is the cutest and non threatening.
Can someone musical define the note that group b Quattro makes somehow?
You know Michelle Mouton, right? 🤔
wow ! Very cool stuff in Audi!
Thanks to Audi for letting us hear the sound and seeing history LIVE!  For knowing that some part of history preserved. There was tears in my eyes :-)
"...don't you have to ask another boss or something?" 😂
Röhrl is faster!🤘
Thank you, just that :) I was showing a buddy of mine legendary b group Audi and this came up after first one; he was overwhelmed (me even more of course) he isn’t a car freak but knows about  Ken, and he couldn’t stop talking about how pure and beautiful his energy was🙂
Cant wait to see a audi v10/twin turbo/sport quattro gymkhana car!
miss the ford partnership but audi should be cool to watch
Like kids in a sweet shop.
Would have been nice to see the S1 driven properly.
U lucky devil Mr block
8:35 anyone know what plane that is just wondering
Ken... i dont know if you met Walter Röhrl but you need too :o
This is the equivalent of been in heaven 😍 and the thing to think about is how much just that ground floor is worth.. wow!
That right there, that Spirt Quattro S1 E2 driven by walter rohrl, it is my dream to own it some day
This is absolutely pathetic to proudly say it"Audi Secret Storage" there is so much more than cars here. I am not even a car person but there is something to be said about this the history of people that built these that raced these and people that loved watching them. You go to Egypt you see the pyramids, India the Taj Mahal, China the great wall. Museums that house famous paintings. Not sharing this especially to generations that will never see such things. This is selfish beyond belief. It with have only been possible to achieve this because people bought Audis that gave them income to push the boundaries. Disgraceful Audi disgraceful... and by reading the comments here it defiantly seems like what I am saying is 100% correct it because most of you are car enthusiasts you are in Awe and just grateful to see this but think about it for a large group like Audi to really share its history it's a damm disgrace
That inline 5 sounds like an r8 v10. I guess it's just a v10 but chopped in half I guess
Great great car, one of my favorites, but the monster is another. Lancia Delta S4!!
poor
They just increased the value of those cars by adding another legend who has driven them.
Oh my! Ken, you’re living the dream, man! All the best!
wow kudos to audi to make this happen. I love it when Legacy equipment is shown on the stage for where they where build
The E-Tron (Detuned, less range Porsche  Taycan) marketing commercial 10 plus years too late by Audi is why he's there.
They wouldn’t let me do doughnuts 😢🤣
Hannu Mikkolas classic rally car. That sound between the trees in the forest, then a dust cloud flying by xD
Goose bumps watching this
GYMKHANA NEXT PLZ!
Look at some SSSR power https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfwgSTOvOI
2:28 that Audi with the front lights been dark, looks really, really cool.
There is just nothing that sounds like an i5 turbo engine.
I'm buying an Audi 2022
That s1 e2 is just sick. Probably one of my favorite cars ever
Kurvajó videó
This was awesome!!!
I know this is Audi, but just imagine BMWs secret showroom of cars 😂
when you go on a tour and end up teaching the tour guide things lol
Beautiful an perfect engineerd cars driven by an idiot who don't know how to respect and drive a car with performance... 🙌🏻
Nothing beats old school... i mean the power growl... That\s why i like Ken's videos
The etron ripping donuts around the s1 e2 was the coolest thing I have ever seen, ever.
damn you can just see ken feeling like he's in a candy store
its Monstrous how Ken is so proffessional yet cool and humours.
It was incredible to see that machine come back to life after over 30 years. thank you
wie geil das audi die einfach mit den dingern fahren lässt
Amazing, but let Timo talk more!! I'm sure he had a lot more to say than this, give him more screen time, the little stuff the told us about the mid engined Quattro was the most interesting part of the vid!  Also if Ken wants to open up more about how he felt about the cars, that'd be cool too. PS: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DRIVE THE LMP PROTOTYPES!!!
THE V10 AUDI R8 IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE SUPER CAR I WISH THEY WOULD MAKE A V12 SVJ KILLER
Oh My❣️
Ken is in heaven
Audi guy 1: “Tomorrow we got Ken Block dropping by.”    Audi guy 2: “Uh, time to swap in the replicas. Move, people, move!”
BOTH SOUND SO GOOD
Brian that friend who somehow weaseled his way into this position and no one knows how but just deals with him cause he’s an idiot.
The racing legend KEN BLOCK is my favourite  race driver of all time huge RESPECT 🤑 from Australia 🇦🇺
Just to notice you for me you are one of the beat rally drivers that show me what rally is and i want tk i form you that in Poland is a company making b group audi quatro replica for clients all over the world even in usa so i thinh you should check it
The ear to ear grin says it all...
This is why Audi is so cool.   Cars are meant to be driven.  We want to see them go, hear them, live vicariously through them when they are being driven.  And Quattro is legendary.   Huge thank you to Audi for doing this.
hahah you're like a teenage boy that finally gets his dream come true
the quattro s1 is my all time favorite! i even got a model signed by walther röhrl from audis 100th anniversary
its not understeer, its audisteer
Skip to 9:43 to watch the actual video
This is like Nissan letting me drive the R390. Cough* cough* Nissan *hint *hint
I understand how fantastic these cars are, but I'm not an Audi fan per say.......that said, this is really cool....go Audi!!
That white micro beast whit modern suspension and fully tuned will be scary fast
Ken.... that's the best sound you've ever made.  👍
Ken is in his on dream 🤣
Group b is best group
and when hoonidi is coming?? :D
that S1 is crazy crazy cool car!!
Thanks to #audi for change History with quattro.   Du you have a timing of this laps?  Which is faster?
lol dude is half afraid for the cars...and his job lol
I love that Ken, after all these years, and every thing he has driven which are mostly dream cars to us regular folks, still gets giddy and excited when he gets to drive something cool. He is a true car guy and this a huge reason I love the dude
Need a better camera Ken. For real. You got the money lol
Imagine being a car guy, being with Ford for 11 years, then all the sudden, you have the keys to a new car kingdom. Holy shit Ken is a lucky man
Work on Audi garbage cars for a living and you'll never want to own one, unless your rich and can afford a new one every three years.
This was when rally cars were truely mental and took alot of skill to handle.. So much love for group b
This man said “plebs will never get to see this”. Literally just insulted his whole fan base.
ah man my dream car is the pikes peak celica, that is a car i would really want to drive
you can see it in kens eyes, thats true happiness
Would NEVER buy an Audi unless I was just way too rich to care, but hands down that 1986 S1E2 is the coolest rally car ever made. That inline 5 with the BOV sound is just magical and so unique, absolutely love how ridiculous the rear wing and front aero components look. Wish this car was anywhere near attainable in terms of 1986 sport quattro chassis or monetary cost, cause it's for sure a dream car.
someday.. in 40 years... people will be in ford museum with the best rallye driver and visit the ford museum to see the hoonicorn. i can imagine him being like holy shit i can actually drive this, i love how ken is still a huge kid at heart
He starts driving at 9:42. Seriously, 10 minutes of blah blah blah and 20 commercials till he actually drives the first car. For 1 minute.... And the car isn't close to as cool as his previous cars.
"they wouldn't let me do donuts" I legit cried of laughter.
Audi heaven😍
Audi shows the rest how to do it again, never seen any pull something special from the museum and get it 'Hoon'd' <-------- (Official terminology) Well done Audi a magic little blue pill for us old 80's rally guys !  (A hint as I thought it would not be appropriate to use the word boner)
nice vid
Best sounding engine ever....
They gave the Tour guy A tour guide 😂
This would be a dream. To all Audi Group B nerds, this is a spank bank.
I love how y’all scumbagged Timo into letting y’all drive “today” 😂
Really annoying to see that these cars are hidden in some noname Audi facility. Fuck those guys.
Starting off this relationship in a very good way . . . . . . . . Hmmmmmmm
1:52 Welcome to Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory
I tell ya, if Audi released a road legal new version of that Group S prototype, I would be first in line lol I would LOVE a Mid Engine version of the TTRS and I think most Audi fans would too!! Plus with the 5 cyl mid engine you could have lots of space in the front trunk for trips!!
Another perfect This vs That episode! Wooiahawieahwooieahwoeiah... Up until 10:53, when everyone stopped calling it That.
I need tissues. 🥴
ridiculous masks, making people look like clowns and making them sound silly
Bloody Audi drivers.
Lmao yea once real auto manufacturers start making eletric cars Tesla dead in the water. Same price way better build quality and looks
i have watched almost every video of ken racing rally and gymkhana but i have never seen him smile so much while driving anything
The priceless look of Ken @ 1.50, like a kid in a toy shop :-D
@ 2:38 which car is that on the right?
Crazy audi
I love that in the group B mental era, the manufacturers, or at least Audi, had another round in the chamber reader to fucking go. Probably for the best and the lives of the drivers it didn't go ahead but damn. And LMP1 style rally class? those stage records would still exist today.
The Group S prototype looks like a Toon version of a Group C car. I recall Walter Roerhl talking about test driving it and saying the mid-engine packaging could have been the key to Audi winning another championship.
legendary. There is however 1 audi in particular that gives me goosebumps just by looking at it. it's name is "IMSA GTO"
Its the rally
DREAMKHANA
Don't care, Audi Quattro S1 E2 is the beautiest car of all time.
Ken you must drive the queens of rally..delta S4 and Delta
That yellow car sounds fucking rad af
Can we get some long videos of the 2 cars ripping with NO music, NO cuts and NO speaking? You have the only modern footage on the planet of these 2 cars with good audio, please let us have them, pleaaaseee.
..and today the best substitute Audi is a Toyota Yaris GR.  Sad
Ken Block looser
Lol, Americans found out that Audi’s are one of the best produced cars on the market ever Especially the ‘S’ and ‘RS’ models. Way better than all the JDM that they found/imported and destructed with their V8 bullshit.
I don’t see anything special in the Audi quattro other than a pile of square sheet metal. As well as the Sport Quattro RS 002 is weird. Is there something wrong with that?.
Zu dumm zum schalten...🙄🙄
No offense to Ford too
No offense to ken block but the only reason i subscribed to this channel was because he’s team Audi now.
i know all the rally cars are cool but….the LMP audi cars are beautiful
There goes the power steering in the e tron
Damn this is Dope ! Hope to see New Audi featured builds in Hoonigan !
That's insane! Such a class from audi letting Ken to rip these legends, he's exactly the man to be trusted to do it.  Cheers from Russia, audi 80 quattro owner
Admit it, we all want to see Walter Rohrl  vs Ken Block
I like how they are explaining the history of audi rally cars to the audi history guy himself
I'm pretty sure this is the first and only modern footage of these driving. Hoonigan with the exclusive footage.
So rad, new unrealistic dream is to get a job at that secret museum
are you boss enough to let me drive this....
Do they have the cars Hans Schtuck raced? That is when I was first introduced to AUDI.
I knew a fair bit about Group B, but very little about Group S, only what was mentioned in Up To Speed about the MR2 Toyota was making for it and that was it. I learned something today.
Trust in the LORD of kings Jesus Christ Forever.
You’ve made a mistake. This guy will not stop coming back…
Ken can just get in anything and drive the hell out of it.
5 cyl sound is the BEST!
He looks, underwhelmed, quite frankly.
I mean... the AUdi Quatro is cool and all ... but if a PHANTOM stands behind it... >.>
Half of time I had permanent smile on my face! Thank you Audi and mr Block.
Ken to drive Audi E rally car coming up ?
You guys are awesome!  What an event  👏 🙌 👌  Would die for... Thx @auditradition for this too!
Fuckin!!!!!  amazing !!!!! quatro legend
😺😺😺😺😺🚀🚀
How good could PR be? Audi : mmhmm
Einfach nur Wahnsinn, was Audi zu bieten hat! Auf unsere Autoindustrie kann man durchaus stolz sein :)
Walter in the 037.. hold my drink
I hope the cars are still in good condition after this ...
Mad props to Audi!  they are an amazing car company. My 1.8T with forged rods is making 400HP with a GT3071R. Such a strong engine and block..
Audi 5 cylinder sound it's like symphony orchestra
Den s1 ist nur ein mensch auf diesem planeten würdig !
Great cars 🥰🥰🥰🥰! Try the Audi 90 IMSA GTO please 🥰
s1e2
This like getting a hummer by Cindy Crawford, while Claudia Schiffer feeds you steak, and after playing basketball with Jordan at his house.
Sick
That prototype car looks tiny AF xD
That is such a tiny car but damn brute
I thought the group s car never existed... now I know how close we were to see the peak of the rally racing!!!
Fair play audi
Listen to the 5 cylinder sound and remember it!
Hannu Mikkola's legacy is living whith that  sound.
Dang audi was good at rallying
Back here for the sounds..
Better to have worn my compliance mask and been thought a pussy than to have never worn it at all. -His journal entry that night
Group B was violent beauty in motion….
not a big audi fan but you whipping the old iconic rally cars and the new car looked amazing .
thats a frog eye sprint
Grew up watching Audi rule rally during crazy days...  Spanish spectators wanted to tag the bull or touch the car... the drivers had enough to deal with.
Elec Don't Make US Laugh Ken U Lucky Sod
The look on your face driving that prototype is gold. You truly were in heaven that day. All the best with the Audi partnership.
NOBODY DRIVES MY CAR LIKE A MAD MAN unless Ken fucking Block shows up...!
Dream Cars. 🥰
What a day out
Ze Germans
thank you, thank you, thank you
hmmm, next gymkhana with audi car ??
Stunt driver, not a race driver.
Wow. De-tuned by 300 hp. Lol
Gymkhana 11: Hoonigan Audi Quattro S1 gymkhana replica.
Dirt 6: Gymkhana x Audi
What an incredible driver
A bunch of Audi pieces of shit, meh...
Audii + K.block  🔥🔥🔥🔥
One of my favorite sounds on this planet will always be the spool of the quattro’s s1 turbo 💕.
idiots wearing the symbol of suppression.
some people are just so lucky with sponsors .. It's always been my dream to race, but I never had money nor sponsors to prove my unparalleled skills. I only had chance to race touring cars for couple months as replacement driver, even tho I beat their own records, I still didn't get a permanent place :(
Ken: Donuts in the S1? Audi: No Ken: Donuts AROUND the S1? Audi: ... Ssuuuuurre....
Thank you Timo !
i wonder if they're all street legal registered. cause of the number plates with stamp on.
Die Frage wo ist Walter Röhrl ... ???
S 4
Audi's garage summed up in one small word: WOW!
the moment I heard them introduce the guys name, I got PTSD for the entire office building is full of poisons mushrooms everywhere for late night security.
It's funny how Scotto turned into ned when he sees a Honda 😂
Hooooooly fck… 🤤
Who the hell is he? Never met guy. Seems to be lame 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 drifting is for wankers
I feel like the younger generation has taken over audi which makes this possible. I don't see any of the old school Germans being cool with Ken hooning priceless race heritage museum cars, lol. Talk about a once in a lifetime thing to do. Every car enthusiast on planet earth is filled to the brim with jelly.
Who are guys at 3:59 ?
How legitimately sad Ken was when he said they wouldn’t let me do donuts. 🤣
Mas meus parabéns a AUDI POR DEIXAR QUE UM PILOTO, USA, senão não tinha tanta sorte, pois o mercado americano é tão apetecível, sempre e as pessoas têm o que é preciso 🤑 e mesmo tirar carros icónicos do museu, como Ken diz, trabalhou com muito construtor e não deixaram conduzir os seus carros icónicos de museu, só este golpe de ar publicitário da Audi vai ser ou ter imensas visualizações de ambos os vídeos, vai correr o planeta em três dias e ficar sempre Q se queira voltar a ver de novo, isto é ser inteligente, o que de mau podia acontecer, a Andi voltaria a por o carro como novo de volta, passado duas semanas estaria de volta ao museu, na pior das hipóteses, carros sem preço, clássicos da história da humanidade e seus veículos sendo de desporto ou turismo, afinal é no desporto Q se experimenta muita ideia nova e só testando ao mais alto nível de esforço é Q se via seu desempenho, todos estes desportos motorizados são a ante câmara de muita evolução auto nas ruas e nos carros Q trazemos na rua, eheh!! Obrigado Audi e Ken Block e team e o museu AUDI E SUA AUTORIZAÇÃO FANTÁSTICA, eu como amante de carros e passei muita hora nas florestas portuguesas para vos ver passar e ganhar no tempo do gr.B, bons tempos e só foi pena as pessoas que se foram por esta paixão, vertiginosa e só ao alcance de poucos, tinham o toque de MIDAS, génios e geniais, RIP para todos esses Q se foram a fazer o Q gostavam verdadeiramente 🙏💯
Já no outro vídeo é brutal e a Audi são uns amores de bons rapazes amantes da borracha queimada e pneus novos viram velhos em 10 min. 😄😄😄🤏💨
The sound... oh yes, the sound.
I love that you guys just shut up and let the legendary engine sing again. My RESPECT.
The noise of that S1!
❤️
But can they make a better hoonacorn or should I say will they............
thumbs up Audi  . A real company . Bold , you all got some balls . I'll admit that
creative editing,  seems like he took it way to easy.
Best sponsorship ever!?!?
Let's see some real rally racer from finland drive that beast
Always wondered what an adult looks like if they were a child again
Ken so laid back would be jumping with excitement like kid in a sweet shop just too see them cars! Something magical happens when see hear group b rally cars!! Fair play to Ken block! For asking for a go 100%raw!☆
Drive the same car of rohrl oh My god.   This mán was the madness behind the wheel .and he can do everything ... amazing
👎🏼no sabe ni cambiar de marchas... si lo pilla walter röhrl caga patatillas el ken este...
So happy for Ken.
They sound so incredible! I could set that audio track on repeat and listen to it all day.
I Was week ago in this city...
So this deadly virus Convid 19 is obviously not around in a room full of Audis. Interesting. What an intelligent virus. It's in the hallway where the toys are, it's in the staircase because they all wear masks but not where Audis are. They offer better protection then this so called vaccine as it seems.
Great fun indeed! Group B were The cars! Did you have the opportunity to drive the fantastic R8 Le Mans too?
China told our EU politicians that they wont do any business with underdeveloped countries that still allow CO2 emitting traffic or industry after 2030...I am sure USA and UK also will be forced by China to 100% electric traffic because today no industrialized country can afford sanctions by China....:-( China also banned all kind of synthetic fuels or hydrogen combustion. Because these are not energy efficient)
14:10 someone volumed down all emotions.
Gonna give Timo a heart attack.
Please quit the cameramen! A guy gets sick that he shakes more than that 5 cilinders at rev limiter!
The sound of the S1 is (at least to me) the coolest and most agressive car sound ever. It was probably best on gravel doing scandinavian flicks and flung around hard to get it to oversteer.
Man Ken block is literally the happiest dude ever he gets to drive greatest cars on earth 🌎  hats off man
seeing ken block driving a group b audi is very exciting ❤️
so we just saw the reason the quattro was never what everybody thought it would be . UNDERSTEER UNDERSTEER and then some more UNDERSTEER ... The S002 was even worse . I wish Ken could speak his mind freely on this subject
That quattro is dream. The sound that thing makes does things to me that my wife never could.
World class....thanks to Audi
Now this is going to be legendary.
Monster is garbage.. only trash would wear their gear..
Hahahahahahaha..... Der blöde Deutsche schön mit Maulkorb... Systemling lässt grüßen.....
Yup audi crushes the gaytrs and wrxs
ken joining audi has to be the coolest thing that ever happened in my lifetime
"The S1 E2 understeers all the time" ... - as all new Audi's 🙈
As a Finn who hates all cars that are not American, I have to admit that Audi made a smart move by getting Ken Block on board. I would never had watched an Audi video without Ken.
Hannu Mikkola! The Flying Finn! Audi group b!
Outside with mask... Inside... No mask Welcome to Germany
Ültessétek be Walter Röhl mellé!  Majd az öreg megmutatja hogy kell ezt csinálni...
Q paso ken?sin todas esas asistencias electronicas ya no es tan facil hacer q el auto haga lo q keres? Otra vez la vieja escuela demostrando q es LA escuela!
The Audi guys must be totally crasy to let you drive Walter's Car 🤣 Okok the Audi guys are crasy that's why we love them 💪❤️ And they know that you can drive but they always know that you only can one way, full throttle 👍 I hope you have enjoyed this German Masterpieces of engeniering. LG aus Deutschland (NRW) Subtitles where cool, my English is a little bit slow to follow all the stuff you say 😭  And by the way, is there any car in the world what touches your heart so hard like the Audi 5 ZYLINDER Turbo, now way that is defently the best sound ever 💪🥰
They all have street legal license plates. How is that even possible??
I think I'll go play Gran Turismo now
Man I absolutely loved this video.  Ken block is acting the same way I would if I was in his shoes.
What an incredible opportunity! How cool that you were able to drive those legendary cars!
Poor Timo xD Great video, respect that he lets you to drive them (I am just on the end of the garage scene)
Is it just me, or is it the drivers blood type after their names on the doors?? Crazy tho
the  sound of the s1 is so good.
Time for an all new series of Honoonigan videos but with new cars. Time to go back to Buffalo!!!
Incredible, absolutely fabulous video
I am from Germany and an Audi lover, good to see you having fun in AUDI Saga cars.
У настоящего раллиста группы Б мухи развбиваются  о боковое стекло :)
I'm waiting for Ken Block to drift the rs6. Famous for it's all wheel understeer.
Imagine if Audi makes him a newer one like new everything but keep the shape and everything that would be bad ass
Gotta love the 5 cylinder with that good old mechanical Quattro engagement.
We're a huge fan of Audi as well! Good one Ken!   Our little tribute to the legendary Quattro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuQoohCpPBQbS6HagFigCnA
Please send my thanks to Audi. As a guy who grew up watching group B as a boy.  Nothing has stuck with me longer then the fascination of what Audi did with those cars.  I couldn't afford an old audi, but I thought of them everytime I  slid a Subaru legacy wagon sideways through a corner in the woods. When I do build my own rally car.  It will be with the old audi quattro on my mind. Obscene.....which is exactly what the hoonicorn is.   Great video.
Ironically a new TT will be faster and handle better
1986
I'm so glad audi respects the legacy of the car but doesn't let their glory days go, they remind the cars why they're so legendary
As much as I loved Ken’s partnership with Ford this so so awesome and a great development
The camera man doesn't know when he should stfu.
Ken Block is the guy that puts a huge smile in our faces any time we see a video of him driving , drifting , teaching around how it is done in general , but this video , this video went above and beyond everything else because of that S1 Sports Quattro EVO 2
Bunch of proto-grownups behaving like childish idiots. Mildly pathetic, but quite typical.
Audi tradition? Understeer! Zzzzz
Crying shame.
Everyones ultimate dream come true and more. Gotta love to see those iconic cars driven again.
2:10 SUOMI MAINITTU! TORILLE
you know Ken, you don't have to try to drift everything. The kids will be ok. Just enjoy the sounds and the grip for once
I’m more of a bimmer guy
man just seeing those cars all lined up gives me the goosebumps i couldnt imagine being there in person
Really cool to see Ken drive cars that inspired him to be who he is today! Lovn' It!
Seltsam, dass keiner für die verfi.... E-Autos nach Deutschland kommt. Die ganze Welt bewundert, was deutsche Ingenieure in der Vergangenheit geschaffen haben aber Deutschland schafft sich gerade selbst ab!
there is only one car that can run endless circles around another car, and that is not audi...
Speechless...
So much Cars ...but He still being a patetic loser in WRC
#dreams
Wow.
Quattro is legendary. Anyone remember Martin Schankers Sachs rally Cross car?
For being “detuned” that thing seemed pretty rowdy
that audi quattro s1 best sounding rally car ever.
Wish they would let Scotto drive them thats the real Audi guy 😭
*Читаешь мой коментарий, желаю тебе и твоей семье, крепкого здоровья!*
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU HAPPY AGAIN, Ken. 😁👏👏👏🤘  That engine sound....!!!??!!! Holy HELL. GLORIOUS   This is freaking DREAM material here. And I also get quiet and tear up when blessed with being in the presence of true internal combustion engine BEAUTY.   I was sad when Ford was stupid enough to lose you, oh man I swear I cried. But the Mach-E made me cry even harder. Especially when they wouldn’t let you Hoon it. I knew that crap video was the beginning of the end. Dipshits. Mustang my ARSE. WHYYYY. It was the death of a true American icon-& Henry Ford is still rolling over in his grave. Man...🤦🏻‍♀️🤬😫   Anyhow!!! Yay happiness here!! This museum is unbelievable. Absolutely. And they still run the cars...?? I get sad when I see glorious vehicles sentenced to eternity in a 5th floor carpeted exhibit. 😞They should get to run.   Congrats Ken!! We love you man. 👏👏👏🤘
Typical americans
Honestly can’t believe they let you do this
Here is link to the lightest Porsche EVER! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YmnseEmny4
The whole dialog asking "Can we really drive these 2 cars today?" was funny,,, and they detuned the cars before handing the keys
😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷💉💉💉💉💉💉☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️👎👎👎👎🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃☢️☢️☢️
Finally! THE defining moment for me to  subscribe. Thank you sweet baby Jesus and VAG. Now have your way with the R10 tdi's please. 😁
I love how the Group S has a license plate.
TORPE
I love how he forgot to mention the lancia 037 beating the Quattro
YES,   THANK YOU AUDI
KEN. B 💣💣💣🦾🦾👍👍💪💪🤝
Die hätten Marco Degenhardt lieber fahren lassen sollen, der hätte sich mehr drüber gefreut
great video 👍 you’re a lucky guy to drive Audi Sport Quattro S1 and the Prototype 002 👏❤️🍀
Oh my God, they actually let you drive the RS 002, a Group S prototype!? Ludicrous!
Poor Timo.. 😂
Thanks audi
TY AUDI for this. this is amazing.
HHAAA   Ford saying " Damnit we should have let him shred the Mach E"
Is that Jimmy Kimmel?
That's the way
Fuck yes Audi!
Im so happy to see those beasts do what they are built for!  Thank you for letting them breathe again!
There is nothing exciting about an electric car. Ever.
Wtf? I thought he just partnered with Subaru?
Damn, Audis Sick, but that F-4 Phantom is too
A whopping 300hp!? So what you're really saying is my minivan has a chance?
I wish you were still with ford still love watching you drive
Did Ford de-tune their cars?
man, donuts in an electric car just sound so awkward. all tire screech, no engine sound.
Bro I literally have the Lego version of the group b car. That is absolutely nuts that they let Ken drive it. I wouldn't even know what to say.
When they first step foot in the garage..... It was like "did I die and go to heaven??" The collection is so stunning !!
Ауди тоже неплохо! ))
imagine upshiting
Great car history
i can also imagine Timon on the side crunching his fingers to the bones seeimg ken drive them
i absolutely love hoonigan and audi for making this video
Time to watch Roehrls pikes peak run again. Absolutely mental
Speechless
having a hard time with them 🤣
Man I bloody love the sound of a 5 pot growl
Wow it says SCCA on the side WTF?
Audi quattro S1 is a one best rallye car.  Groupe B is a world best rallye!  And thats it❗️
blow off so fantastic sound
Helmut thinks what boss gona say
Should hit up Randy savage from savage garage. He build a class B rally car just like this and I’m sure he would let you drift it and have some fun.
Did I see correctly? A rally car prototype, lighter, more powerful and with... a bottle of NOS?
When the HOONIGAN crew arrives in YOUR garage, and they make YOU, look like the visitors. See the German Audi guy being totally out of place, it's funny af.
Timo! Well done! Emotions under controll!
What was that song wen ken first seen the cars
Riping the most iconic beastly rally car ever....💥✔
love it...Tears in his eys.
3:55 great piece of Audi Sport history I had no idea
Luckiest Legend alive to Test drive these beautiful Piece Of Art....
wish they join wrc and dakar rallies...
Samo jako Ursuz Marko
Damn! This is definitely a testosterone  booster
After seeing the two side by side...I gotta say Group B > Group S.
The quattro sport is an amazing car. Very few know they are a cut and shut, they literally cut it in half and 32cm was removed and then welded back together. it did also have composite materials but it shows a cut and shut can be totally safe if done properly.
he tries to look more exited when driving the E-Tron than the time when we drove the E-Focus
Lo que faltaba ya
imagine the insurance upon damage...
Holy fuck
when you see Ken Block been Star Struck by a Rally car you know it's special!!!
What a shame. The whole video.
This video shows how awful you are at driving Ken. Complete and utter respect to Hannu MikkolaMichèle MoutonStig Blomqvist, and the great Walter Röhrl.
imagine either of these flying down a wales stage at night ... gonna say I only have the stones in Dirt Rally, and even that's scary, couldn't imagine IRL
what a cool video
It's easy when you can practice everything dozens of times before filming. His venture into rallying showed just how average he really is.
Do you know what else comes from Ingolstadt? The illuminati!
in dirt rally 2.0 in vr anyone can live the dream
Team Audi. THANK YOU. Timo I'm sorry we love you. Please keep this going caus the Audi history and progression is fantastic. Ken's amazing and Audi is amzing. nuff said
I have one for sale for you ken block a 5 cylinder turbo 4 door
nothing beats 1500 hp v8 hoonicorn
The way the 5 cylinder sounds...... Oh me, oh my! Like angels singing!
Imagine wearing a mask
6:11 Ken's whispering "what?!?! 😆"  His mind is blown!!
i love that ken turned the tour into his tour
I Love Audi CAR!!!! M'y Favorite Model Car is S4, RS4,A6, RS6,A8 Year 2004-2005-2006!!!! Its m'y Favorite Year!!!!!
Audi s1 Quattro my favorite car of all time, and the sound of it nothing compares.
My god,  this man is living the dream.  I can't even begin to express my jealousy and awe.  Ken is so lucky, getting to drive these cars.
It would be good if Ken knew how to drive these priceless machines without bouncing the engines off the rev limiter like he does in all his own cars. Show some respect 😕
Can't do donuts is the best series but can do donuts around the b car 🤣
What happened to him driving for Subaru?
Best Rallye Car Ever
If Ken's new car doesn't have the twin triple fog lights, they're missing an opportunity.
There are a few truly magnificent sounding engines out there. A hot Audi 5 cylinder is an eargasmic thing.
I don’t know about you I’m excited
Quattro sounds are the goodest
Timo’s getting fired…. But I think I want an Audi now….
The other dude needs to learn how to be quiet and let people talk..  Go audi!!
The spare tire ratchet strapped behind him added a level of Group B authenticity that I wasn't expecting.
Hot Damn
Dude first time I have ever seen whatever that new Audi is at the end but I love that slammed pancake stature it has and of course the group B legends you lucky dog!
Scotto, how were you able to even talk during this? I'd be completely speechless the entire time seeing those cars lol.
best games 2021 ( download full free)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZe39gwn134&t=48s
Audi bout to sell a lot more cars in USA
Audi made a present to Ken!
Can’t forget michèle
Group B *everybody runs*
I wish normal Audis had some of the insanity of their motorsport heritage. But kudos for their technical achievements.
My dream would be to drive the Audi 90 quattro IMSA GTO
does anyone know where there is an archive of this era rally races? i need more!!!
how to win over new audi buyers....
Hannu Mikkola. Hyvä Suomi! Osuuspankki..!
Ken and Scotto confused about not having to scumbag Timo when in reality Timo is reverse scumbagging Ken and Scotto
Was the clock of Walther röhrl actually still in the car?
Ken block hope to see you on our streets in 2021 or 2022!
Resumen: Audi deja destrozar joyas de museo en manos de un "drifter" estadounidense con el fin de promocionar coches eléctricos. Habrá pilotos y periodistas más profesionales que no han tenido la suerte de probar esas máquinas
Car porn🤣
Time to honor the one and only Audi drift king - Christof Klausner
Audi rules!!!!!!!!
Da hatte JP doch seine Finger im Spiel.
Way to go,Audi!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't know what looked happier... Ken driving the Quattro S1 or the Quattro S1 being driven by Ken.   That engine sang beautifully!
Ken hits the track and the Audi guys starts thinking we don’t have enough insurance
The turbo whistle combined with the 5 cylinder symphony
"If we all agree that we get a little more gentle"  Reminds me of the scene from Team America "I will never die"
You guys need someone who can pronounce names like Walter Röhrl's correctly for your videos. You probably wouldn't have to twist my arm too hard for me to come along on the occasional trip to Europe as a pronunciation consultant, in order to spare you the horrible embarrassment of butchering the names of such icons. Just saying. 😉
Mega cool die Jungs von Audi das die sowas machen.  War auch schon in den heiligen Hallen bei Audi Tradition . Danke noch Mal dafür
I hope the kids know about the old days of streetfire befor YouTube it was the car vids that made us car guys. The OG videos like the JUN supra drift, climb dance, Smokey negato and the 200+ mph V12 supra and dahlback Audis. Please kids if you don’t know the greatness that is the Audi tuner Dahlback do go and watch some epic videos of 5 zylinder monsters.
Dope that they brung out an old german Phantom to do a shoot with….      You should drag race it.
12:40 They seriously had the blood types of the driver and co-driver painted onto the friggin' DOOR OF THE CAR?!  That is just unbelievably awesome. In our current climate of putting safety over everything else and tuning everything down to cater to the lowest common denominator for liability reasons, it's a bit of a trip to see they had a sport so wild (Group B rally) that they felt there was enough to justify painting your blood type on the side of the car. Also makes me wonder if the teams would keep a few pints of their drivers' favored juice on tap in case they needed to start a transfusion in the ditch while waiting for evac.  Just unbelievably cool, Group B. The cars, the drivers...insane machines and titans among men came together for the most legendary contest of reflexes, guts, skill, and speed ever conceived in human history...even if only for a few years.
Beautiful cars
Never thought anything would get me out of my RS7 but im going to test drive the etron gt next week cause of this vid. Let audi know their partnership with you is already working lol
Da hat aber einer Pipi in den Augen.... 😉
Ken Block Looks like Kimi Raikönen
I'm still getting ford ads on this lol
F*"king Hell Audi!! Why must it be this noob with no clue about your heritage...?
Should've shown a pic of Scotto's green Audi for confirmation.
in my opinion the best sounding car.
Ken must have most simple disguise ever. Takes helmet off but dont put hat on and I wouldnt have a clue who hi is.
Really interesting despite Ken Block being the "star". Come on Audi, choose a drive and not a hipster. Sure he might be a "nice guy" but he's not gotten to where he is on talent. Not particularly insightful. No new revelations on the Group S. Just a mediocre publicity stunt.
I thought that prototype was a porsche for a sec
Congratulations!!! Fantastic video, fantastic driving!
Ken Block is not a rally driver. He is a YouTuber !
Welcome to my Home Ken 🥰
Aweome vid. Thanks
RS4 Drive kenblock.,
Pretty cool just to see a real group B car fired up and rolling!
That prototype looks like a mix of an Ultima and an RS200, and to be honest, I love it for that
Thats it Im buying a new ttrs for sure now. Audi ftw. #babyR8
Ken Block can drive sideways. But that's really good. The S1 only drives transversely when it is driven in the limit area, unfortunately this driver cannot. You can see in his face that he wants to drive sideways, but he hasn't moved it fast enough. Walter Röhrl can drive this car, this driver can only move it. But it's okay, congratulations to Mr. Block that Audi has granted him a wish.
Very nice video 👍👍 The cars I would dream to drive 😲 I have my Urquattro, but driving an S1 one day would be crazy... 😍 The head of Ken when he get into the "secret garage" 😁
why the fuck do you all keep touching the fuckin cars?
I have observed ken is never alone in these videos. 'arurowwararwowahraruai' Yeah thanks for that ken. Look to Translater
.I love cars too (I have a 2017 Corvette C7 with the fun manual transmission) but it ain't free and stocks are one way to make money. .....,,AMAZON:  Yep, I bought a ton on the dip.   It's getting cheaper relative to its current earnings (half compared to last year).  ...With the Delta virus coming at full speed ahead, pandemic sales will make a comeback.  Amazon's not going anywhere so I know that eventually it will come back.     Fidelity considers Amazon as a large growth company (probably because as big as it is, it still only has 7% of the retail market)  buying via Amazon Smile donations donates some money to my favorite charity too!  Get on board or be runover, it's up to you.
My god what a dream come true.
1:52-1:53 There it is, the look we all strive for.
Well the *secret * place ait no secret no more
You Lucky son of a gun!!!
Whats the name of the song???
Group B, so fast they outlawed them.
Sounds like a bit more than 300hp lol
Seeing Ken run these thing in 2021.....I couldn't stop smiling
When Audi WRC?
First audi Rs maybe ....sheeessh
Absolutely can't wait to see the Hoonigan/Audi livery combination of black, red and grey!
y el lancia para cuando ken ese es un auto leyenda
Wild! 🤙
Seeing old race cars get to live again is the best!
Ken could have the choice of any car in that shop and he chooses two of the most iconic and amazing Audis in this world. Epicness in video form here... just amazing... pure awesome.
The Group S Prototype is so incredibly cool. The fact that even Ken thinks it would be too terrifying to drive on a rally stage shows how extreme it really is. Incredible to see it being wrung out and spitting flames! Also, it sounded like the gearing was super short, so it's always on boost... 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Audi= No way to change that timing chain so you just throw the car out!
Michele Mouton and her Audi Quattro is the GOAT
Bro You are like a kid with a bunch of toys , would be driving all day
The acting with the masks is so dumb. Either wear them or don't
The legendary Walter Röhrl group B Audi, one of my favourite drivers. Ken should go say hi to him, that would be awesome.
https://youtu.be/bLObHlLtaEQ
I've never been so jealous of anyone in my entire life
I just don't think electric car is something for Ken... Other cars are just great!
Hahaha, i knew it, he isnt able to drive it like it should have been driven xD, ha boys its a car for manuel experienced, left braking quattro legends, not for boys
Learned I'm not rich nor connected enough
this is the best Audi ad I have seen in a long time, though its a bit lengthy.... LOVE KEN AND HOONIGAN! CONGRATS
best video so far this is crazy…
It's nice to see Jimmy Kimmel in casual clothes.
08:25 the look in his face is priceless 🤣🤣🤣
Love this but can you add maybe 10 more commercials?
Luck bastard
Wow amazing !!!
Just show me what's under the hood
That sound.....
Still got beaten by 2wd lancia tho 😂🤪
Ohhhh, imagine the audi as a daily dr3am car.!!!!
This is great look for Audi 😃👌🏽😬🏎
WHY DID THEY PUT MUSIC OVER THAT i5 turbo engine sacrilege!!!!
Ken. The Paul Walker of rally drivers.  And that's not a compliment.
cringe show
Amazing. Audis and Ken Block were meant for each other
Wow, I did not know the RS 002 existed!
Who is Block?  Never seen on the podium in rally or rallycross.
The prototype looks like a ford rs200 had sex with a metro 6r4 and produced the prototype
can you do anything other than drive a car Ken?  What a BORE it is to watch you outside of a car.
What Ken Block needs a thousand cuts for the video to be perfect, Sebastian Loeb only needs one, if at all
Tell me I need to buy an Audi without telling I need to buy an Audi
I could just imagine Ken slowly rolling back from his stint in the S1 to find another person standing there waiting for him. Walter Roehrl walking up to him and asking to get his car back...   I would have loved to see Ken's face at that moment 😃
Hallo aus Deutschland.
Lancia should have a museum like this with the Fulvias, stratos, 037, Integrales etc An finally electric tire smoke
Detuned?
S1 + Gymkhana = Broken Internet   Just sayin…
Best not talk about getting thrashed by Lancia. 🤔
This is insane
Ken for a second felt like he was a kid again. The moment he realised he gets to drive these beautiful machines.
ken's laugh in the beginning, fuckin love it
Love the enthusiasm from car nerds like me, these have been the best videos ever on this channel!
I've never seen Ken that happy before. This is petrolhead heaven.
super
I think they told him he can drive at the air base cause there's alot of space and nothing he can crash into if he does crash. imo
Shivers, hearing that RS E-Tron GT's screaming doughnuts.  Those legendary cars feeling the wind again.  Thank you guys for this video.
This Scotto guy from hoonigan is a cringey obnoxious dork. After talking over and belittling the German tour guide in the garage, 9:30 he proceeds to downplay the significance of Ken driving the e2 by comparing it to higher hp cars Ken's driven. He was deadass when he said he was jealous lol. Someone remind him these videos aren't about him
Nothing tops the sound of a sport quattro
Don't let em just sit there. Get em out & RUN EM !!!
You are one lucky man Ken !
Diese Dummheit regt mich auf
Great to see the guys all behaving like big kids in a big kids toy store. Wonderful enthusiasm for wonderful cars.
To Audi......... That is CAF to let them drive your cars!
You could've posted just a thumbnail, no caption and I would've still clicked right away.
The Turbo "Chirp" of the old cars, in Germany we say "zwitschern", is one of a kind. It makes me Goosebumps...
My favourite driver with Audi....!!! What else can i ask for!!???!!!???
The only thing my SAAB has incommon with the Audi Quattros is that I have the same Bosch extra head lights.....
I said to my friend "Damn Timo is wound tight" they responded " I was just going to say how much you are like Timo".
Love seeing Ken jolly as a kid in Disney!
OMG...@ 5:53...thats the original TT...wow- group S R&D expenditure did spurn a profit afterall for AUDI...roof conture, front end tapper...put that on a Golf 3  MQB platform and it's the car
Detune from 500+ to only 300hp.. sadly detune i would not accept.. at least 400hp. AWSOME video!
Note to self: sell all the Subies, buy only Audis. Because Audi suits "get it."
Timo is a BOSS!!!
Nobody thought about Michele Mouton’s car? ☹️...that’s the piece of history
Imagine having a collection like this & not allowing members of the public to come see the history. Should be criminal.
wooo, the sound is there. its perfect "D
…oh boy !!…. AWESOME, a boys dream
Love how the le mans winners are sitting there
The noise......sssssshhhhhh just listen
Make a video of just Ken's reactions.
woooooww!!!!!
Audi, Thank you. Thank you so so much.
Nice masks guys.
Hottest shit ever. So f*****g cool
holy shit all that torque at 12:01
.... *LET'S GO BRANDON!* #FJB
Und WALTER RÖHRL so:  Wer ist dieser Ken 😆
Its nice to know that famous people are still humble... Cheers guys, good to see all the smiles and to see ken become a kid again.
btw: These are called the "Holy halls" of Audi :)
Seems like they not really understand where they are. 🙈🙊🙉
now that's a place to work
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I’m pretty sure there’s still a mid engine quattro hidden in a barn somewhere in Europe. Piech was a smart player, he didn’t just let them scrap those secret cars...
10:12 so lego building full size cars now?
It broke me that they didn't go in dept with the le mans cars :(
gt etron no BUUUURRRPPPP!!!!11 meh.
The filming of the old Quattro being driven is pure garbage. Doesn't do it any justice at all, there's plenty of old rally videos online where they sound like a jet engine on steroids.
So is audi coming back to rally or what this is?
That E Tron was Crazy doing Donuts, when the only Sound is Tyres Being Shredded. Ken didn't want to Park too Close at the end there, that was funny.   I hope that Building is well Protected because the Contents are Priceless.  Knowing the Germans, they've thought of everything.
@01:48, I’d probably have a instant heart attack 😅 WOW 🤯
Ken Block , you rock you seem such a down to earth kind of bloke ,I guess that what happens when your hero is Colin McRae all the best from a Scot 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 in Oz 🇦🇺
Michelle Mouton, Pikes Peak 😁
The e-tron has Ken feeling nervous and moving his mouth nervously, that's a first
That prototype has plates so its road legal in Germany. That's insane. I think the boss there use on he's free time.
woah... I wouldn't have let someone who crashes so much drive those!! haha
I usually feel like most of the time when pros get new sponsors they play a lot of the excitement, but seeing Ken being baffled over getting to drive these cars and then the genuine happines, when he is actually in them was really heart warming. Great pairing!
Going to a museum and not knowing what is S2 - hmm...
Den där översättarrösten är inte programmerad för att tala svenska
When I see what you see live, ppppphhhh my god help us. I have water eyes.  Thank you for dis moment.  #halle77 Marco for German's
Got subtitle on, it did say ‘[applause]’ in the pure fury sound moments: OK
My favorite Hoonigan and my favorite brand! Life is good! 🙌🏼
Love the video... Somehow hate the Hoonigan guy showing off his knowledge to the Audi guy....  rather have the Audi guy explaining the stuff :p
That was epic! The look on Ken´s face!
I'm pretty sure ken can swap his ford rs2000 for Audi's rs002 prototype before anyone would notice being that they look alike.
599 Youtube Dudes bought the Audi a1, thats why they dont like that video!
If this is not considered living a dream then you're probably dead.
Camera work is just horrible. Listen one gear change at a time and jump from one cut to another. Would have been nice to actually hear the car more than 2 seconds
Thank God he went to Audi now maybe I can afford a 92 Ford Escort like I had when I was a kid
kinda like to see ken drift a dodge ram for the heck of it...
Mr. Block, you guys should built one like the Prototype Audi's
Ken  was about to cry he was so happy lol
Weldone! WELDONE! WELDONE! GUYS! THE CONFUSED FACE OF TIMO's IS PRICELESS
The audi  is the greatest rally car ever in my opinion thing is bad and that sound is unbelievable
True definition of AMAZING GRACE how sweet THAT SOUNDS 🎶🎵🎼🎸📻🎷.. the harmony in all these 🙏🙏🙏  Congratulations KEN, HOONIGAN & TEAM AUDI
Wow!!! What an amazing honor congratulations.
The sounds.... 💦
Ken please come to Wisconsin !!!!!!
The music at 1:53 is perfect.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Not even an Audi fan. But that freaking S1 is literally sex on ice.
Dear Mr. Block, ever want to mentor someone I am your guy 😝 That feel of a car moving sideways is something I would love to learn. Huge fan my man!! Very inspiring
Ken Block in a Group B Audi.....that's a match made in heaven if I could ever think of one!
AMAZING!  All it took was Ken Block to bring us all these wonderful cars!
AUDI 5 Cyl engines sound like the devil screaming.
NGL with how they are treating Ken it makes me think 1 of 2 things. 1 They think this is a really good marketing strategy for Audi. 2 they really are about this life... Either way I kinda want an Audi.
WOW. no words(edit-ok, some words) I really wish they'd have let him drive the Quattro at full power, but, I mean...even to touch that car is a gift! So yeah man, that was awesome to watch! :D
as that good rallydriver he is *cough* he definately earned to drive walther röhrls car *cough cough* not
This a beautiful vid thank you
The stance on the S1, lunacy, great noise.
Dream cars!
Bruh 1:50 Ken looked like a kid at a candy store the size of a Walmart XD
Congratulations Ken and Hoonigan team,  you've come a long way. Can't wait to see what the future holds.
독일의 50년전 자동차 기술이 한국의 현제 기술보다 우수하다
I always thought  he  was a joke and it’s confirmed….he drove one of the most crazy car in the world and….he said nothing….
5 cyl motors sound better than v8's, come at me
Please call the next hoonicorn the Raudi… that would be awesome
How cool is that ripping walters class b car coolist thing Ive seen.💯💵🏁
If there is only 1 of something then saying oNe Of One is stupid.   Just say "only" instead of trying to sound like a dramatic douche.
Feels so weird to not see the Quattro with like 300 people on his way
That F4 phantom looks pretty sick most maneuverable beast there.
I can’t wait to see hoonigan Audi devision 👊 Audi content is gonna be strong , so sick !
Ken’s been hittin the twinkies and Cheetos. I almost didn’t recognize him.
Lol ken is like a little kid😂😂
I'm curious what's stopping a company from building a series of tube chassis equivalents to the classic quattro's and renting them out for track day events? It's not like these car's can't be built today. The majority of the value is the history.
limiter king 🤣
Im a simple man, when i hear brrrbrrrrrrrrrrrbrr sudududududu i have to give a thumbs up
That inline 5 sound <3
I was thinking you should try the Lancia Delta Integrale but for drifts is better the Audi Quattro S1
I've seen the group b in person launch at goodwood FOS but it still sounds amazing on video.. proper ear-gasms! perfect content
PUTA QUE PARIU!!!!!!!!!!!!!
At the end  something must burned always...!!! Anything...!!!
Hopefully the next hoonigan will be an Audi with 5 cylinders and turbo.
nuttttzzzzz
Imagine just coming to work on this museum and you hear the lick music begin playing☠️
This is awesome. I mean all we see on these legendary cars is just sitting in a museum. Or watch videos from decades ago. More of this needs to happen with all those museum cars sitting like a statue.
That`s 4K???
wow.  that was NEXT LEVEL EPIC!
Gone in 60seconds has nothing on that list
Акуеть....где это находится
So good Ken!
Treat .... New footage of the infamous S1 in action.  (as i put away my box of kleenex)  Nice to see the prototype as well.
I HAD GOOSEBUMPS FOR YOU MAN!
Pls pls pls Audi 90 Imsa :)
Amazing👍👍
If i had a garage like that,id litreally be sleeping in there.
That five cylinder sound!!! Most engines sound like a single "note" but these are like a chord, multiple notes in perfect harmony.
Greate Audi.
Megadork
Justice for gabby
Yes.
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
So many eargasms
Better than sex
I feel for timo cuz he knows if Ken screws up he will be looking for a new job and they are just scumbagging before they drive off.
What sort of limiter were turned off for the RS GT to rip like that?
This channel is boring.
Audi really wants us to think they aren't just a BMW for women
lol e-tron...
We are very honored that you were here with us in Germany Ken !!!! 1000 thanks for that XD I still have a question ..... where do you get such a racing suit or something like that? Can one get it for sale anywhere from you ???? 1000 thanks in advance
You: I want to drive Walter Röhl's car  Me, an intellectual: I want to drive Michéle Mouton's car
08 rs6 avant twin turbskie hoonicorn!!!!!!! Dooo ittttttt  if you dont your weenur will fall off
I had goosebumps the whole time watching this😯
"They didn't let me do donuts" in the car Proceeds to do donuts around the car *big brain meme*
So there is a hooniquattro coming? Right?
If you NOT replace friction elements in that trashy differentials before EACH race... you have useless legend with one wheel derive.
krasna zbierka v garazi ne majo?
Now I feel the need to find some cash to buy a Audi
Звук просто словами не описать
Putting the music over that engine was a sin. My ears have not been pleased.
This is literal video jizz
Ken's face grappling with the Quattro
More like hOOOOnigan!
Holy Christmas Chestnuts, some mean machines in that lock up.!!!!
coolness overload!
Did Ken Block need driver instructions to drive these cars, I seen him drive and I am unimpressed
If they gave me a tour I'd have to apologize for fondling myself during it
Car of the best driver ever... Walter Röhrl
Aficionado,los pilotos de grupo b eran mejores q tú
Ken Block on Christmas day 1:52
so excited and then he does some stupid etron promotion lol. no. you remove spark plugs, you remove the soul. you are driving a train now.
worked a few years in the neighbour building with free view from my desk to the garage entrance, it was always a pleasure to watch when the vehicles had test drives or were being loaded :D
Thank you Ken and Team Audi ❤️ Hearing those turbos thirst for air once more has made my day. Stay safe and well all, peace
At least they aren't in Jay Leno's garage. Fuck that guy.
Congrats Ken for signing with a legendary team like Audi man !!!! Respect and props
Brian, I know you're American, but stop cutting Timo off.
That is so awesome!!!  By far my fave video of ken!!!
Ken lets face it you are just show driver and not actually a rally driver.As fast as i remember you have more crashes than winnings in rally.No offence ✌️
I'm drooling...
literally a dream come true. that is so amazing!
No imsa audi test would love to see that
holy shit!! this is a bit of me right here
The scream of that five pot is the most beautiful sound in motorsports history... I heard it in the Corsica mountains when I was young and it haunts me since then ^^
For Audi to let Ken drive these are freaking awesome! 😍
The S1 never won a World Championship
8:13 audi r8 le man quatrro
Che spettacolo Ken.
My husband is building the S1 E2 and stuff as Replicas.. So I see and hear them pretty often.. But hell this one is giving me goosebumps all over, every single time.. Greetings from Germany 🇩🇪😎
Sound... 😇
There are many people extremely jealous and mad right now. Lmfao
If you like that, then you gonna LOVE  https://youtu.be/mKVikEdbrrM
Excellent boys keep up the good work.
Quattro the best
I wonder what he'll be driving on the rally stages for Audi
Brings back memories! Wish I never sold my sport quattro, back in the 80's. But back then they were a LOT cheaper! I'm after one of the 2.5L 5 cylinder RS sleepers now.
hermosos
Words can't even convey how jealous I am of this experience. I'm so glad you all were able to share this with us!
Тим Блок пополнел) Стареют легенды) стареют)
The smile on Ken face literally bring joy to face man he’s a kid in a candy store and his parents is letting him get whatever he want. Happy for you Ken can’t wait to see what else your goin to do.
Fucking crazy
Lancia delta HF evo...............💦
Think about this, because of you, now over 1 million people will have been able to hear the engine sing from an obscure and secretive 1 of 1 vehicle from automotive history.
Haltet den Kerl von den schönen Audis weg der fährt doch alles zu Schrott
monster in old era
Yall playing them old clips of him and him looking even older in those old clips😂😂
Y'all about to scumbag poor Timo out of a job!
This is super cool, car porn at its peak, but would you please let the guy from Audi do the explaining? It's just weird that you guys keep attempting to explain these cars instead of him.
1:59 priceless!
Not a big fan of audi at all..most of their vehicle are ugly.
Lass dein Bart wieder wachsen ALTER @KEN BLOCK .. damit (mit dem Bart) kommst du 10.000 x cooler und kompetenter rüber!  ;-) ...
Best sounding cars ever!!!
Awesome 🤘
i’m sure there is going to be a quattro with like 1500 hp for ken
How was the group s like to the rs 200 both look similar
Are we going to see an r8 honnicorn
1;54 Ken block i'm in haven ❤️
the cars that are gonna come from this are going to be mad! and maybe they will come to forza as well which would blow my head off
Knowing Mr. W. Röhrl (personally) it provides special emotions seeing that car "racing in wild" - congrats and hopefully you've been enjoying the stay in germany you guys
EPIC👍
Remarkably few people know that they were mainly the creation of Roland Gumpert's bonkers mind - check out the Apollo IE for what he's been up to recently
reason why i love audi they scared you wreck the car but are also intrigued seeing what you could do with them cars so they take the risk bringing them cars outside audi is amazing <3
You just can't surpass this.
I'm really glad he didn't crashed any of them.
Gasp...rediculous car compared the twin turbo Mustang
Ken is unbeatable at turning other cars into real feats. These machines, however, are not made for such brutal handling; they need a driver with a finer sense of driving.
Little Timmy passed out when he saw Ken drift the etron around that beast
10:39 Such An Awesome Flyby!!
Omg that engines are loud af bring them back please 😭
I look more from legends of lmp then rally cars haha
Ken jizzed out when he came on the car floor :D
I grew up my dad and my mom brother always told me of the favorite ralleys cars especially group B cars and then telling me and showing me videos of Walter doing pikes peak made me stick to Audi vehicles to this day 👌dream come true atleast for Ken block congrats man , my son goes crazy if I show him any of Ken block videos even taking him to the race track in South Africa in cape town .
Shame on kens mate , Not such an Audi nerd @ 4:12 , He says about the windscreen angle on the SWB quattro being for headspace when in fact the angle was increased to reduce glare inside the car mainly off the dash board , Lucky boys thou getting to play with them toys .
What car are they going to build now. Hoonicorn. Dope. RSICORN SUPER DOPE.
I love the way Ken manages his hopes as he realises he might actually be allowed to drive them:  "You take these things out of here?"  😂
The tour guide feels not needed at all haha you guys just talk more than him and maybe know more ? :D
Didn't know Ken Block was a fan of Audi. Seems like he understands a bit the honor he is given. We Germans are very very strict about our heritage cars. It's great ro see them been driven though, since many of us are too young to have seen them race back in the day. Thanks a lot!
Against Walter Röhrl, in his Audi, you don't stand a chance today either.
Stig is like , bloody kids . That group s is Fugly . Tarmac ain't the same as lose gravel !
No matter how much of a Ken Block you are - when you are allowed to lay hands on the very steering wheel Walter Röhrl used to drive rally stages with you get soft knees and a tremble in your hands 🤣
Hands down epiq of Audi to actually let Ken whip them cars around. my newfound respect for Audi went up up up
Thank you Audi , for allowing this.  No realy thank you!  And who better than Ken to fang these beasts around the track , 10/10
The plain white car is the first and last try to build a Porsche 😝
Grown men in those flatcaps and especially those t-shirts with big “grafitti letters”….. you look so childish and ridiculous next to those great Audis and you’re not even getting that. Simpletons.
Way to scumbag them into letting you Hoon historical whips lol. Audi is bad ass for this. You earned this fellas. Low key heard Kens voice crack when he realized he gets to Hoon it.
Que pena da ver estos coches que hicieron historia en los rallys conducidos por grandísimos pilotos llevado por un payaso que se hace llamar piloto.
Damn dude, I wanna see you drifting the streets of Park City 😜
Amazing how the old school I5s sound exactly like newer I5's. And not only that, but if you double the playback speed, all of the sudden it sounds like an Audi V10!
RS200s baby sister
God damn I'm not into rally cars or racing ,but damn this video is perfect. Waiting for the next one already
im fanboying so hard right now
this video is so important for the car community
Walter Röhl forever!
Starting a GoFundMe for Timo's ki's college fund after he gets fired. Your sacrifice was appreciated.
This partnership is going to be epic.
First time I drove an Audi, I had just bought it (in trade for shop labor) - a semi-clapped out Audi 4000S and jumped it at 50mph going around a hairpin over a railroad track, mid drift that was behind the shop.  I fell in love that day, and it wasn't until Ken did the bullet-time jump around that corner years later I was able to realize the power of that love affair.
God bless cant wait for the new apparel
Soo HOONICORN VS A FULL BLOWN AUDI QAUTTRO
just hearinga turbo in 1986 was a jaw dropper.. add that freaky 5 cylinder sound with gears meshing in many places as AWD
This really shows you where we’ve come from. Cars today are sooo much better balanced. But these required pure driving mechanical knowledge
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Bye Ford, hello AUDI!!!!!
Who cares without the full power. 😒
https://youtu.be/9GhFdkZSww0
Fact : Audi made some really crappy cars in the early days, like 70's and 90's and .... .
Haha plebs don’t even get this!! I’d buy that if it was on a T-shirt!!
Awesome video
Not so secret now is it
@1:53 Ken Blocks Christmas vision 😅
I want an Audi
Imagine being one of the 400 people that 👎🏻 the video. No culture!
Well Audi did it. Now I want a Quattro!
This really says alot about Audi which other car manufacturere would let you take the two most iconic cars of their brand to ripp around in?
Best sounding ralley car ever. The turbo sounds are demonic.
Wonderful to see these cars in action. Too bad that tall guy in black was there, he ruined the experience.
Yea but the Porsche smokes them solid in every test & a majority of the engineering shows up on Porsche. The correct performance Audi kills all comers on the street & track...always have & always will.
Stepping into the Group B S1 is already a dream comes true. Driving it? That is the highest ever privilege someone will ever get. I mean, IT'S A CAR THAT WINS GROUP B! The most dangerous motorsports event ever existed!
Thinks that e-tron is hands down the best looking ev
I just realized, I've been smiling the entire video.
Screw Ford screw Subaru AudixKen instant dub
If you get to drive an s1 there’s no half send.
You know things were serious when the blood type was listed right after the names on the door.
It's surreal watching Ken's journey wind up here in Audi's garage. The countless hours spent grinding every single one of those gears to entertain his fans are finally coming to fruition. Congrats on joining the Audi team, Ken!
If you want to die happy you need to own in your garage only two cars from Group B era... Audi Sport Quattro S1 E2 and Lancia Delta S4.
Scotto, "Well, when Audi fire you, I have Plenty of None Running Audi's to fix back at Hooligan you can fix"!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣 I'm Dead.. This is My Most Favorite episode to Date...
that was crazy wowowowow cant believe they were willing to see these cars getting use instead of letting em sit for another few years before the next dude rips em
The best sounding cars ever imo of course
Fantastik
What can be more cool than Ken in a S1 E2 and in an unrealeased "Group S" Audi ????
The sounds of those cars was the best thing ive heard in awhile.
Audi is really rolling out the red carpet for Ken. they are letting him drive his dream car hard but not quite Hooning it. and then they let him do the same with a prototype! and then to top it all off they let him Hoon the E-Tron? Ken obviously had a blast Scotto about came in his jeans!
I worry for Timo. “You let him do WHAT?!”
Thank you AUDI for reminding us what cars are made to do. I have tons of new respect for your brand.
Oh wow. I had 4 80s era quattros, 80 x2 90 x1 100tq x1. I've watched countless YouTube videos of racing Audis, I've been a fan for 25 years. I do not think I've ever even seen that prototype! Incredible.
I could not stop smiling the entire time watching this.... my face now hurts, thank you Ken for making my face hurt. Seriously thank you 😃
Those magnesium wheels on the S1 are probably more expensive than Scotto's whole Audi collection :D
Wow this is insane !
Damn the limiter noises sounds awesome would love to have that noise as a alarm clock in my bedroom :)
so freaking cool dude, so jealous but seriously, happy for you man. Well deserved
2:43 ARGHARGHARGHARGH 😆
Kens insurance must be so high if they just let him drive those.
OK, he's a very skilled driver, but there's gobs of those. For me anyway, it's Ken's passion, personality, and childlike giddiness over cool stuff like this that makes him The Man!
I'm not sure what i'm more excited about.. The split between Ken & Ford or his new partnership with Audi!
he's doing donuts around a 2.5 mil car!
lol one of the rarest rally cars ever made and the editor barely lets us see it
That in between car is legendary. I wish Audi kept it.  Such a cool video! I love this new partnership!
Dear audi can you remanufacture this car.
wahnsinns sound kommt schon der Stradivari sehr nah genieal
cool a f4 fighter at the airbase
6r4
O M G !!! love it !!!
Am i the only one who find Ken and his cameraman very disrespectfull to the man at audi?
This is sooo RAD!
Wow, this is so freaking awesome
These things sound so alien on modern sound equipment, its incredible...
just black Dust at the tires from the Audi RS E-Tron GT
😲
They weren't kidding...  Audi LITERALLY pulled out ALL the stops for Ken!  Literally a dream come true for ANYONE who loves rally...  Can't even imagine...  😃
Nice
No ones saying rip it around only rip it around if you know how to drive with a clutch ken
Ok....so I'm still really confused 🤔 Is Ken still racing for Subaru?? Isn't that a conflict of interest??
Americans are just dopes well these guys are anyway the ignorance
I wouldn't be surprised if they don't allow Richard Hammond in the same district where this museum is located, much less come near the building itself.
Nope.
I was soo excited when the audi deal was announced
This is amazing!
Go from Ford to Audi. I'm disappointed like you are a trader to American Car companies. Sad Sad Day. Was it money made you switch?? After all you and anyone in professional sports make 100 times more money then our American Soldiers make that get shot at to protect this country. Makes me sick. Guess Vaughn is last 1 I root for. I will wish you luck and stay safe. Do hope Ford smokes you.
Ауди и андерстир -это синонимы😆
sting said  wrc are for boys group was for men
ken is finally home ;) , and he loves the Etron-Gt RS!
OMG
The sound amazing.
Mask man, siete ridicoli e vergognosi . O forse avete bisogno di una maschera per stare al mondo vergognatevi .
Is there an update for the gymkhana stuff ?
Hannu Mikkola, Ouninpohja, Jyväskylä, Finland, 1985...
I saw that E-Tron GT in the streets a week ago. Never heard of it, was it 2021 model maybe ? Or is it still not really on the market ? How can I ve seen this car then just in the city parked ? mmm
5:59 MID-ENGINE???
Love the mid 80s cars ..im not a audi guy but would like any one of them in my garage the yellow 1 kinda reminds me of a ae86
9:50 You're all welcome 👍🏻
naprostá Pecka
Holy moly.
And you thought supercars came from Italy, or England?
5:25 I got shivers
Liked before 30 seconds in lol so many awesome cars in that garage
Has the cameraman got a drinking problem?
Sad left American Ford for euro junk.
Need drive for Subaru
Would have been a lot more enjoyable without your loudmouth friends chiming in every 2 seconds
Lmao the guide just stood back...
The windshield angle change wasn't for headspace. The factory drivers complained of glare from the more laid back windshield on the long wheelbase, so they stood the glass more upright in the Sport.
A kid dream come true. Ken truely glows.  Really happy you got to hear the menacing turbo pshhhhhhhh from the inside mate :)
KEN BLOcK tu déblok ! Arrête ton Cinéma!  appel Ari Vatanen il va te défoncer ta Race malgré son vieil age ....tu n'y connais rien à part ta thune l'argent ne fait pas tout les americains... tu devrait avoir plus de respect ... tu n'en a aucun envers  ses mécaniques Européennes
Ken's partnership with Audi has definitely increased Audi's coolness factor!  Awesome vid.
My lord. You managed to scumbag them into not only letting Ken hoon Walter's original but also that mental prototype?  I mean who looks at a group B Quattro and thinks "hmm. Nice but needs a bit less weight and some extra danger"?  Then instead of his boss saying "Schmidt you're an idiot - go home" they just said "OK - build one to try it out".   Ken I think you've done the right thing going with Audi. They seem like our (rally people) kind of nutters.
Not often I actually speak out allowed when watching any car videos, in fact probably never but this one got me talking to myself in excitement. So lucky and great full for this type of video. On board or making of the video would definitely appeal to so audi nerds
Soooooooo weird, I literally bought GT6 off eBay last week and have been using that exact yellow and white Audi all week and then this pops up in my suggested 😂
Kids want Teslas... Men want Group B Audi Quattro...
The group S looks like Audi hired a couple of Ford engineers. It’s an RS 200 and with less power and an ugly rear end.
👏🔊🔊👍👌🇳🇴
Proud Swede to se so many Swedish flags 😁
Not being funny but your camera sucks big time whenever a face is in frame it looks horrible. You have all this money yet you buy a shit camera and you're making videos for Youtube?? And before anyone says it's the lighting in the garage I say Bullshit it's the camera being a potato with a sub par sensor. I mean c'mon the whole video looks grainy as fuck I would be embarreced as hell putting this up on YT.
That was awesome  yes and you should  bring your mustang and have that engineer  take a rip yes would  be fun to watch
Loving this 🥰
Fucking awsome
Lol they wouldn't let me do doughnuts hahaha
Walter Röhrl sees this and thinks: “Ok. But why is he on the brakes? "
I have some of those cars in gta
Not a fan of these cars . I would’ve like to see him stay with Subaru and the off road trucks .
Audi be treating Ken right. Remember when Ford wouldn't let Ken "HOON" the mustang Mach e?  Audi FTW!
Ken has big balls doing what he does. But Timmo HAS GIANT BALLS for allowing Ken to drive these. Well done Timmo. Thank you
OMG! So speachless. LOL@have you seen our videos. hhahahahahahaha
Love this !!!
It took them less than 7 mins of this video before they started scumbagging Audi to drive a legendary 1 of 1 car 😆😆.
Did Ken cry? He looked super emotional!  To be fair.... If that was me, I wouldn't sleep for a year 😂
5:06 why is there a Toyota sticker?
I was a little sad to hear you are with Audi but after this video. I’m glad you made the switch!
Nimm doch bitte die scheiß Maske ab
I want to see the LMS out 👀
where is Petter Solberg?
Good job driving them the way they are meant to be driven!
Always hoped to see him rip a Xr4ti after seeing that one they had sitting around.
Meanwhile audi r8 in background:excuse me I'm here too 🥺🥺
Fkg Awesome!!
As a huge audi fan boy, years ago i really wanted ken block to start working with audi. And this happening makes me insanely happy
I wish more auto retailers did this let people show off there cool shit to be document
Oh that f4 fantom mixed in ohh yes
the white audi S1 is the first evolution, before it got fully developed. michelle mouton and Hannu mikkola drove those. in my little town there is one guy building a very accurate and the only one replica of that one. the one in the audi museum has at least wrong doors and other little things on that, well at least compared to where it first was as test car.
Wow. 1
This video should be named, "Audi being the best car company for 15 minutes and 26 seconds by letting fans drive their legendary machines"
Much better editing than in the last video. Thanks!
👏👍👌🇳🇴💪
Зэ бест!👍🏻🦾
Ugly short carts....
this is part of history now.
"AUDI - только я могу заставить пустить слезу Кена Блока".
Happiest Block ever !!!
Full props to Audi for letting museum pieces not only see the light of day, but to stretch their legs.
I’ve seen a lot of donuts and general hooning around in real life and on the tubes, but this is the first time I’ve actually seen the definition of ‘tire shredding’ fully applied in that last bit with the e-tron. Did they mount special tires designed to go up in plumes of black dust like that?
Haha ken looked like he was about to cry when he first step in that garage🤣 , as a car nerd i totally get it  thats a very special place
It's so cool to watch Brians and Ken's friendship come so far...goals
Sooo S1 E2 Hoonigan, yes or yes?
At 01:50 Ken enters, looks left and creams, which was even vocalised. Then at about 07:40 'so we're taking these two out'? His knees went a bit
The prototype Audi at Goodwood FoS is a literal rocket, shame it never made a debut.
Pure rallying machines..no wonder these beasts had legends driving them back in the 80ies..
So cool!
Scotto - "We can go drive these now??" Timo - "What have I gotten myself into??"   I know he didn't say that exactly, but that sure was the look on his face! lol
Ken looked like he was about to cry , when he first entered the museum.
This vs that?
Is Marco Degenhadt (5zyl. Marco) sleeping anywhere?
Friggin Amazing...
living the dream
а личико то пугливое, да камерой скороSTi добавлено оператор 5+ ! Ken- (F)!!!
Audi S1 Top
I hope Kens next gymkana car is an old school Quattro. Tuned up of course
Ken all most crying… Awesome 😎 real passion there!
can't wait to see you in Audi
Kens good but not in the same league as Walter . Great to see him partner with audi
Such a decent guy, very respectful.  Which of course suits the Germans, that in my experience are also a well mannered fun loving folk
My gosh. This video is just perfect! These are the rally cars everyone dreamed to drive at least once in a lifetime!
Livin the life
i have never raced before. i raced ken block. i won. the guy is useless
Early Christmas day for Ken
queen of understeer
Beautiful sound.
This would be a better video with NO MUSIC, yeah it’s really annoying for a car show.
Did noone in this comment section see that his next Gymkhana video will be "Electrikhana"? Everyone is so pumped about how amazing these cars sound and how great this partnership is but this isn't how it's going to be.  The next Gymkhana will be tire noises and "whirrrrs." :(
Timo is the man
…S1 a lot of understeering …
@14:10 Now that the Era with petrol engines is nearly over Audi decides to build cars that go sideways??? Don't get it...
This is story and history created by Audi dis is a dream for rally driver like Ken 😉🔥👍😎
13:32 ahh poor Ben Klock he just dont know how to drive that Audi Quattro Group B
Best “this vs that” ever ?
Will you try to drift the r18?
I see Brian's knowledge and excitement about audi is comparable to nads with Hondas 😂😂😂
Scotto love for Audi is pure !!!
The bloke with the blue hat sounds like he's from the Simpsons...
Just wow 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful basement. Damn.
Bro this will bring a lot of people to Audi. I never even knew that Audi had all those hidden gems dude what
A new journey 🙏🛫🍫🎉
picture me just drooling uncontrollably the entire video
Now .. if he could actually do it in a proper rally .. then I'd be impressed ... come to Audi Tradition to get a guided tour .. ignore the guide ... typical Amuuuurican
ken block chez Audi c'est comme faire du patin a glace sur du sable sa sert a rien .... la marque de l'ennuie par excellence fait pour ne pas glisser prend un drifteur embassadeur... mdr
Audi <3
What an honor that must have been . Keep going block !!!!!!
There are a couple of these privetly owned and we regularly see them driven in historical hillclimb demonstrations. alongside other Group B like the 205 T16.
At 2:00 like a little kid in the candy shop…..priceless!
Timo is really the star of the show here IMO
I remember back in the early 80s when Audi sold some of the crappiest cars around. You drove it off the dealers lot and it depreciated like 4 grand in ten minutes. Not good.
The US guys laughing their asses of when Timo shows up outside with his fucking mask on😂😂
and they say the germans are stingy :3
It's interesting that a lot of the audi groub b footage is from the 1000 lakes rally in Finland
Some say his full name is Kenneth Blockington-Smythe.
Build a B5 avant again 😍
Thank you Audi.
Audi rs002 more like ford rs200 in round
The noise is just awesome.  Gorgeous, gorgeous sound
Everybody in America thinks Ken Block a "super driver" , Then he came to Finlnd to race  Thousand Lakes Rally.. There it was apparnt to be just a "tire burner"
Such typical American people, you just want more, don't listen to any other person, talk the loudest and have no understanding.
9:30 As soon as the motor starts and Ken is sitting behind the wheel he instantly gets into the focused "non talking"-mode :D love it
Thx Audi
The name of that heavy filthy bloody drum and bass drop at the end? Lol
Love this Audi series fair play! Ken seems like a top guy. Congrats on manifesting more of your dreams my dude
they dont let the guy from audi speak lol
That means some actual good  group b cars will come to forza
6 in 7-ish billion chance of driving it, what a lucky guy. awesome!
Vorsprung durch technik
As someone who has an Audi, this just makes me love the brand 1000% more. Ive never seen a company say sure, take our priceless cars out the museum and rip them😂loving this partnership already cant wait to see what Ken makes
for americans, I expected to see the 1989 IMSO Audi 90 Sport Quattro Racing, coz Rallying on dirt isnt a american thing.
So what you are telling us is that the next Hoonicar is going to be a 1000 hp monster Quattro? ...Please?
Now we are talking! The RACETRACK cars !!! YEEEES !
Living the dream. Maybe this partnership can provide driving these cars on events like rally legend or eifel rallye festival. I’ve seen the group s one on the eifel rallye festival and was unbelievable how fast is was with Mr. Röhl behind the wheel.
Can’t help but smile, Ken your simply the best
14:10 Damn... How you gonna disrespect group B like that... lol
Audi tradition,see the legendary group B rally cars is awesome and priceless! 11:53 EARGASM😍😍😍😍
fuking amazing
The quattro s1 its like you drive a dinosaur like a tirex when the turbo get boost its we be incontroleble those drivers in rally who drive it  is like a robot because its difficult drive car like that in the soil or snow its unbelievable
Fan or not, that was great.
Audi ftw. Glad he figured it out
secret key? its a RFID scanner. my shitty apt building have had those for over 10 years.
Driving a rallye queen on a airfield... Walther Röhl will laugh loud.
taRumlüg  Programmierer der Master  K. I.
Quality on YT is 4k yet the video is grainy as af, time to update camera?
This just shows how fucking superior Audi is to a brand like Ford.
In the mid of video.... 1 mind is f**** my head... Ken, u lucky bastard! Keep Sport Quattros alive...
Fair play to Audi, it's a crime to keep these locked up out of sight, no better man to show them off also
Make. A. Sport. Quattro. Hoonigan..
Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland ist nun im Besitz der Kommentar Sektion. 🇩🇪😅❣️✌🏻 Grüße aus Süddeutschland
I hope Ken Block realises that Audi are not interested in HIM, but in the sheer number of idiots that will buy Audi's just because they let him do these videos ! Amazing how much the RS 002 actually resembles the Ford RS200 ... who seem to have been ahead of Audi at the time GroupB cars were shut down.
Daumen hoch 👍
Dear, parents just because your child is smiling at their phone, doesn't mean they have boyfriend or girlfriend, they are just watching this masterpiece.
The S1 is another breed of cool
Oh my word! That engine noise!
Ken is like the most humble and most likable guy ever. Awesome to see his dreams come true – again and again ✨
For me the  group s car looks like a baby from the front.
Wow
i love it 2 million views all most in 2 day !!! Ken block your the man
I see a video with ken and jp in near future
No fucking way.
i'll love to see Ken Block race in the my summer car rally
German engineering in the perfect hands ...  i hear Audi drives all cars from time to time ... no car there is staying forever... and thats Audis love and passions for Motorsport.  thumbs up and greetz from Germany :D
Just amazing
The fact they let even a select group of people drive those is incredible and beautiful.
Pretty awesome. We'd all love to be in Ken's shoes here
Germany is the country of the best cars in the history of the car industry. car land.
Машины из того времени, когда у Ауди не было дизайнера
🇬🇧🚙👍🏼
I am so psyched for this collab haha.. Can’t wait to see what’s coming next. And i hope you still work with forza haha, so we can drive audi hoonigan cars in the next game 😜
Ken is pure good and his love of cars is infectious
First time I’ve witnessed Ken clean shaven.
That guy telling the guy from Audi about Audi's 😒
Heard that the group B cars was possible to enhance even further to 1000 or more hp from the 500 some of them had. But many people was dieing in them due to not being able to turn, so they cancelled the project.
this video is overpowered with pure 5 cylinder engine sound
Awsome👍👍
This is the type of exhhaust sound that gets edited into movie clips
sooooo cooool
Subaru to Ford to Audi. Amazing career.
Lol, they are excited about the rally cars and I’m going crazy over the TDI LMP car that broke the game when it did the 24hr distance race.
Legends. No words. I will sleep in the museum if I can.
Da bekommt Ken, ein feuchten Schlüppi, in den heiligen Hallen von Audi 😁👌
insane!!!!
You won't see him in a mitsubishi that's for sure
Was it me or did Timo look like he was regretting life decisions when they ask if they could drive them now
OMG I Wish I Could Hear These Cars In Person Thank You Audi For Letting Ken Block Test Them !!!
This is epic 💪🏽
This was fucking AWESOME for Audi to allow this. Amazing history pieces like that deserve to be displayed to the world to remember.
Wicked rides
I love old Audi's
guitarist have guitar face and ken block has drift face
Thats real comedy...the audi guy asking a giant man with a hoonigan cap to treat the cars gently...
8:34 casual f4-phantom UHHHHHH
Me thinking the white rally car looks weird Suddenly me thinking it’s an amazing car because I see the nos tank
Kens modern remake of any of these vehicles is going to be amazing
#Irozmotorsports
Hannu Mikkola's audi?
I wonder if ken driving a audi le mans car?
So really this was smart  advertising for the AUDI RS ETRON  🤔
Ken's team just takes over the audi guy from explaining what's what and they start educating him 😄
you kill me man !!! Bravo   🙌
As iconic that Quattro was I still prefer the RS200 styling.
Welcome to Germany Hahahah
Timo the plug
This is why 4 Rings is my favorite.
Wow wow wow! Amazing cars and history. The sound out of those 5 cyl motors is incredible.  So glad Ken got to drive them
Das Hoonigan?
Audi: "Ken, you want to race with us" Ken: "no" Audi: "We will let you drive the Group B car" Ken: .......
You guys should talk to randy from savage garage he has a replica of 1 and its a exactly like the actual car Ken drove in the video he may let you rip his audi and do what u wana really do watch his video you'll like the group b audi he has
I really hate the Audi nerd, stfu you’re not Ken, we get it you know about Audi, but damn just stfu.
The one of one car by audi looks a hell like ford's rs200, witch design came first audi's one of one or ford's?
Legend status.
Live the dream of all dreams! I envy you Ken and Scotto for sharing this incredible moment. Love the pre Quattro rally cars. Huge Audi fan myself and my dream Audi is the d11 v8.
E torn is incredible boring. It’s almost annoying to hear just tire screech.
The way ken said “ they wouldn’t let me drift it 😢” this dood is a legend
Modern moron BS...
9:43
The sport quarto looks like it corners like shit no wonder it a prototype an rs200 would kill it  imo
That group s prototype car is definitely the ugly duckling of the bunch
I love that sh!t eat'n grin Ken has when he is driving these beasts!
Shit.. I’d quit my job right now to have a chance to just clean those cars.
Stig Blomquist driving an S1 started a stage in the 1984 (I think) Finnish Rally and his navigator had brought the wrong route notes. "No matter." He won the stage.
Just wow!
And this folks is how an automotive manufacturer rolls out the red carpet for their new guy. Seriously awesome start to this relationship with Audi, I mean letting the one and only Ken Block drive museum piece cars is just the warmest welcome Audi could of given him.
Great PR for Audi, them doing this makes me like them way more than I already did. Legends!!
Did they even let Timo say some words? lol Oh yeah they did. :)
I absolutely love that Scotto took over the tour. Any time a hoonigan gets into his element they take over. If you need a Saturn expert ☝️I got you
Fun Fact. They filmed on an activ Airport of the Bundeswehr/Luftwaffe in Neuburg. Donau ETSN
Ken the straight brim hat is so dumb crown it.
How awesome ken. Glad you lived your heroes
That turbo sputter is mouthwatering
Went from American Ford garbage to German high class garbage!  LoL. I'm not talking about the race cars. Just the consumer cars.
FIL had a 5000 turbo - can't wait for the next episode
I like audi's but they are disposable cars for the past few decade or so sadly enough!
The windshield area of the sport quattro was from the normal 4000.
This is a enormous part of history
Holy shit that prototype made 1000hp in the 80s, thats insane
Welcome to Europe Ken Block! Have fun bro!
I mean if you're gonna trust anyone with a car like this it's Ken
I like how his video titles are in the third person. Ken block: "Ken block drive car"
So, rs002 vs rs200
audi audi audi
I got TEASED with the R10-18s! Was hoping to see more than just background shots of those monsters. Anyway, super awesome video!
At 2:00 Ken just looks like a kid in a candy store.
That anti serge housing with no bov !!! Omg
Kinda interesting to see what ken can do besides rally. This is awesome.
I had an '84 Audi Coupe GT Quattro back in '91. There were a few around at the time, but mostly non quattros. Most of the Quattros were the 4000s Quattros and 5000S Quattros. I had no idea what I had at the time and was an insurance write-off due to vandalism. One of the great "shoulda kept it" moments of my life. Nowadays is like unobtainium. Probably recycled as a soup can.   *sigh*
Lol. As the fenders grow, so do the pants
No, you're not an Audi nerd if you don't know what a fucking "A" pillar is called.
This is what makes Audi such a cool company.
couldnt imagine driving it on a gravel stage but they do best on snow stages
incredible!
Congrats Ken! I can only imagine what the experience was like.. I clearly remember the first Formula 1 race I went to.. Early practice day walking around I heard the first engines warming up and my insides just swelled up I  thought I was going to explode.   I don't know what it is about man's relationship with cars that makes someone feel like that but it's absolutely amazing.
im soooooooooooooo stoked. I WANT TO SEE SOME IMSA GTO CARS!
Lancia
Try to drive a Lancia Delta Integrale or a Lancia S4.
Just paused at 7:37 to express my happiness about this masterpiece so far🤗 you guys are awesome, thank you!
This whole video needs a comment every two seconds, but I’m overwhelmed. You are crying, I’m not crying…mumbles scratches self
This video makes me happy that after 3 days of owning my RS5 I had it out on a track.
So Ken left Subaru again?
08:10 Scotto almost crying this is too much jajaa
“They wouldn’t let me do donuts,”. He looked so sad when mentioned it.
Wow what a gesture from Audi and a dream for. Ken,   Take my hats off to them all.
Would love to own a Audi. Just not the maintenance bills that come with ownership.
Very nice! Adrenaline rush! 👍🏽👊🏽😎 Lui/Chicago
Big ups to the crew who saw this collection last year on hoonigan channel!!
that is about what my garages in gta 5 look like just rows and rows of classic iconic race cars to see it in real life is so much more amazing
Ken is da man. Recently met him at recent NHRA event where he signed my hardhat while I was on a service call. Best dude ever for taking time with his fans.
Meanwhile Toyota: (Forza horizon 4 launch) soooo, we don't want old cars represent us. Fuck them, you don't get to drive any.   Meanwhile Audi, IN FUCKING SOCIAL MEDIA: go, have fun!
legend
Tbh, cars are meant to be driven
I know we are going towards electric cars but I need to see a insane build like the hoonicorn
That group B car is what started my love of rally cars.  I think I would be terrified to drive either of those cars.
I hope they let you drive the 2.7 biturbo mk1 TT!!!
'have you seen our videos?'.... I lost it laughing on that one. Thank you Audi for allowing us to see such an amazing cache of superior engineering. KB and Crew....I am speechless on how you played that (classic).
OMG the sound is still amazing.  Fantastic machine.
I kept wanting to see the SwingLine Stapler
something special about the sound of that 5 cylinder.
When Ken is in the s1 he is geeking out so bad you can hear his thoughts and it's a 10 year old boy screaming ARRRRRRRRRRRRRR over and over again
As an Audi fan I am SO STOKED that Ken is now working with them. Hell yes.
Cars are meant to be driven
What people dont know Timo is a legend i seen him in garages during the r18 years when Audi was slaying WEC...........
Lol loses to a Audi and drops Ford and jumps ship
I love the fact that everything there is impeccably clean
Ken and Audi ~> [SUBSCRIBE]
Ken just about lost his continence when he entered the garage
You know what kudos to Ken truly accomplished
these cars are the gds of heaven and hell!
There are not enough thumbs up buttons on YouTube...
I don’t understand why people give ken block a view on the guy, I get that he not Colin McRae or some stupid comparison like that, but you can take away the pure skill away, anyway ken, keep up the good work, love from Australia.
Love it! But can we let Scotto drive something please!!!
Audi has to buy more tires now. 😅
13:52 omg did ken damage the splitter of the s2?????
Where is Walter? Call him!
Is this show about Ken...or the big guy?...honest question
if you cant imagine that 002 down a gravel stage you should check out andy burton and his peugeot 4wd rally car going down a gravel stage. pure poetry in motion
Was I meant to feel sorry for Timo? ,because I do.
the Audi group B Sport Quattro S1 was the pinnacle of rally cross meets formula 1....it was ungodly fast and the sounds it made/makes is like listening to a full on pissed off demon meaning absolutely f******* Awsome \m/
I'm so jelly!
Just remember one of those was a girls car!! Tarmac??? DIRT! Lets just hang the engine FORWARD of the front axle,,, what could go wrong!
goosebumps...
Amazing cars , Amazing seeing Ken gush over these cars 👍
I wanted to write something else, but I am just speechless. Well done👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The sound! ❤️🔥🤘
the widebody* audi r8 in the back looks so menacing just sitting there
I'm so F cking happy for you!!! NEVER STOP HAHAHA
ken is so happy  this is awsome
The S1 is notoriously difficult to drive and requires a special technique to make it go well around corners. If you play your cards right, Walther might just show you how it’s done!
The temple of myth!Audi Quattro for ever!💪💪💪Thank's for this video!!
You are living the dream
Se vuoi provare le vere auto da rally devi venire in Italia e guidare una Delta Integrale o una S4 o una 037 o una ECV 😉
I'm jealous
After leaving Ford, just can’t get serious about Ken Block with Audi. Sorry but it’s pretty lame now. It’s over for Block.
Audi is now #kenblocked ! 💪
7:45 easily the most excited anyone has ever seen Ken Block
Meanwhile Audi sales are up from last quarter. Thanks Ken 😂
Ken's Audi history class: Auto Union, 30, 40 years of other stuff, QUATTRO, Group B Quattro, the LeMans dominance, Etron. The smiles on their faces when they let us know they can't run these cars near people trying to do actual work because they're too damned loud? Priceless.
Damn! I'd be so honored if they offered me to drive one of these. I mean imagine the level of trust they must have in Ken. These cars are literally irreplaceable and a huge part of history of the brand Audi.
Watching Ken go all fangirl on these Audi’s
Hoonigans i have to say that was a bloody fantastic video, it really cheered up my day.
When they ALL put on those STUPID MASKS I lost interest
ford dont spin the tires on the mustang e even though theyre about to produce thousands. Audi hands him the keys to a museum quality rally cars worth millions and just says have at it. Ford never had a passion for racing.
Audi is love, Audi is life. Fact.
These videos are sick. Congrats ken !
Keep up the good work! Video editing is superb on these vids
“Actually, we’re going to take you on your.”
AWESOME!!!
Can't stand any of these dudes!
Thumbs up for the car. Not the tools in the video.
Daaaaaaaayummmmm 100% props to Audi for letting the Lions out of the cage! Such beautiful cars. Time to take the Pikes Peak Quattro next Ken!
I love how the ford guys said that he can't hoon the new SUV "mustang" and these guys were like yea you can race around a closed airfield in the  $2M Quattro rally group b that Walter Roehl  drove and the 1 of 1 group S plus to finish it off you can do donuts in the $3M RS E-Tron GT around the Quattro rally
One guy on Poland have just recreated one of those S1 E2 for a guy in states for dirt cheap compared to the original. I think it went for 125k USD.
I didn't even recognize blocky with clean shave 😕
So Ken... When did things start to go so badly wrong for you?? 😁
It is good to be Ken Block :)
Full of shit etron
when you see that beauty in any video it surprises me it gets any dislikes but on that only 313 to 43k i dont think ive seen higher liked ratio on any youtube video
The Audi Ceo's, hard on carcaine...''Let's give Ken Block our 2.5 Million Group B Car to rip the shit out of it!'' Thank you Audi. :D I expect to see a Group B Gymkhana Movie ''Made in Germany'' in the future. With Walter Röhrl as special guest of course.
I have seen the white one. Live.  Very special.
Ooooh that limiter at 12:11 🤩😍
Da gibt es vielleicht ne Handvoll Leute die den Gruppe B Prototypen bewegt haben, und dann lassen die einen wie Ken Block fahren, der dem Wagen auch mal richtig "in die Fresse gib"..... geiles Ding.  There are maybe a handful of people who have moved the group B prototype, and then they let you drive like Ken Block, who sometimes really "bangs the car in the face" ..... cool thing.
you have to go to jp performance
Awesome
Do this two have to laugh at every sentence ?! Being disrespectful for could seems funny for Americans
These turbo sounds man ♥️
so you're telling me, the next gymkhana car is an audi? SICK
Ken's face at 1:52... pure gold!
The etron rs gt is fast but the sounds coming from those 5 cylinders just can’t be beat! Immensely jealous that you even got to see those cars let alone drive them!
ken block is a marketing ploy, cant drive worth shit!
ahh ... the germans ^^
next time u have to drive a very crazy impressive car, the lancia Delta S4!!!!!
Ken is in heaven :D
Never really noticed how big Ken blocks head is...💆🏻‍♂️🙌   *Big ol'chromedome*
No need to San how great this is and your Videos are of Ken riding cars is. But please do a little more of carporn. You know wo is really great in doing those kind of videos. Especially if you have the chance of getting these wondeful cars out of that packed garage. Pls Import carporns to the US Just to celebrate These beauties even more and to get a better look at them. Thx and Keeper up the good work!!!
The best sounding rally cars of all time...
Make the old one faster with a stronger turbo wastegate spring. The new one needs IT help. Good fun thanks Ken
Greatest sound EVER! Thanks Audi, thanks Ken
i always thought of audi as a boring brand but i guess they are pretty cool
Ken composed a freakin orchestra with those two legends! Lovin it! Props to Audi for letting that happen
Why do they wear masks at the very beginning then take them off? Masks are dumb
im studying in leipzig and I have booked a trip to Ingolstadt to see the museum already because my audi nerdness blew up from this video like holy shit. This audi partnership is BEAUTIFUL
The Champion livery R8 in the museum 😍
ford wouldnt let him drive the mustang e fast but audi gives them museum cars LOL
I think just about every manufacturer would have something cool stuffed away in a secret place.... It would make an interesting series if someone traveled to all auto manufacturers museums or storage and test drove these cars while giving us a little history on the cars.
Drifting has been a good way to improve the sound of the electric car at the end of the video.
Very ugly Protoptype RS 002... But Group B Audi looks vey very nice :))
A man's gift makes room for him, and brings him before great men.
Damn I want Nissan to let me do this to their museum.
So happy for you ken!!! 🤩
I’m happy for ken getting to chase his dreams but I’m still heart broken he left Ford Ford and ken block were my childhood he made me fall in love with fords cars such as the hoonicorn and fiesta rally cars please say it’s not the end of the hoonicorn please
Donuts in an EV doesn't change it; they are still boring.   The S1 is stunning though.
De-tuning the cars is like hog tying a lion's dinner.....
Best thing I’ve seen for a long time 🥰
All those leman cars 😍😍🤤
U can tell ken blocks in heaven here
This is fn EPIC!!!!!!!!!
Picture quality sucks, not at all 4k, most 1080p, guess 720p👎
Hannu Mikkola <3
Wow! Simply breathtaking.
Hopefully Lancia get in touch next!
are you going to build a crazy audi to rag about
Sinceramente no creo que sea la persona mas indicada para conducir esas leyendas, son demasiado para él. Me gustaba mas cuando estaba con Ford. Esto es puro marketing de la era internet, en este caso Audi se ha equivocado de piloto, aunque es probable que la estrategia les funcione. Que pena. Al final las gymkanas las graban mil y una veces para que salgan como salen. No obstante, a ver que máquinas le preparan. Quizás me equivoque cuando los veamos.
So stoked. This and the Halo Warthog build. 🥰
That I5 sounds so freakin good 💕
Making donuts around 2.5k must be fun! xD
Sadly from 2030 on all combustion cars including classics will be banned from public streets in entire EU and Scandinavia  :-( In Germany the  Green Peoples Party gave order to shorten fuel supply from 2025 on by  reducing all conventional fuel stations to only one state operated  central gas station per city or county. Now they even want to slow down  all the gas pumps from 20 litre per minute to 2 litre per minute...From  2027 on in the EU certain car spare parts will be banned too....as  exhaust systems, turbo chargers and even some engine and gearbox  oils...California and New York will do the same from 2027 on.... So no  investments should be done in oil burning cars any longer....They even  created a new kind of crime here, called emissions and smoke crime. Called Abgasbespaßungsverordnung in German.... :-(//
They brought Americans out what did they expect when taking American driver on sign
Need… more…
🤢
I had to laugh when you took the pic of the model rally car. You guys are just big kids, living your dreams and sharing it with the world. How cool is that?
Cant wait to see more, seems its gona be 🤯
Man this video gave me goose bumps i wish i was born earlier to experience all this
DTM audi...please.
Ken has so many necks at 0:25 lol
Both car's fantastic 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😻😻😻😻😻🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩🙏🙏
Now will Ken must learn how to drive totally understeer cars. All of those .... 😀
hooly shit...a new era begins
RIP Ken's Neck
Dream car for everyone whos like rally
Just when you think it couldn't get better!! Can't wait for the next video!!
Bring back group B..PLEASE..
Dude, how good would it be they let the Audi guy speak and tell the detailed history about all of those rally cars and sometimes the big guy adding what's missing... Instead we got high school clowning...  The Audi guy said the Gr. S car was working, while talking to the big guy....and then the big guy asked him if it was working...come on!!
Omg... Its so crazy to think ken block once was like in a 50km radius of me.... I live in Ingolstadt near audi... I live near the glänze park... Its so fucking crazy...
Ken  Barbie👎👎👎👎
I don't know why hoonigan Dosent make ken a repro to run on stages.
Lmao that guyz no ken black lolkeep it lit bro
Those cars sounded just as good as I imagined they would 👌🏼👌🏼
Danke an Audi 👍🤘 just amazing
We got Nads as the Honda Valedictorian and Scotto as the Audi Valedictorian, love it.
I bet that was the most nerve racking doughnut he’s ever done 😂
He got to hoon a fucking Quattro rally car
8:27
Ken Block has the coolest job ever.
historical rally cars, awesome cool
Wasn't the early quattro extremely front heavy so it would understear
He was definitely holding back!!!
What a machine!!
As a loooooong time Audi Fanboi, I approve of this relationship.  First car in high school was a Canadian Spec Audi 4000s, current car is a B8.5 Audi S5
I know this id off topic but that symphony song at 1:51 hit me different lol like Edward scissor hand or peter pan magic moment lmao anyone know the title??? 🤔
This is some of the best content ever!
The ur quattro and the 80 coupe  s2 is still the best looking beast
Cederbergs and Blomqvist quattro was extremely fine
un-fucking-believable. What a dream come true!
So awesome for Ken to get the honor of working for Audi  Also great they allowed cameras in their "secret" museum.  I've been into German cars over 20 years but have gotten into Audi Quattro cars the past ten. Owning a few A4s, TTs, an A8/A8L and an S8, converted a 99 A4 Quattro 1.8t from an auto to a manual and recently bought a 06 A4 Quattro 3.0 cabriolet.
Very very very welcome to Germany Ken!! Always welcome!
Museum piece driving a museum piece.  Just kidding ken is a legend !
FINALLY KB get a deal with AUDI. They brought the AWD TURBO RALLY CAR into existence. Sorry Subaroo guys but you gotta understand, You ain't got nothing for this Historic Car Company. The only thing Audi hasn't done much of is F1, except their Le Mans P1 cars are fairly close. Nice job getting this partnership together.
You didn't mention hannu Mikkola with the S1 Quattro
My like of Audi begins and ends with their group B rally cars
Ken did Timo a favor. It’s called an Italian Tune Up
They wont let me do donuts “😔
Man that's a bucket list dream of mine to see those museum cars! Just to be near cars that people like Walter Rohl, Hans Stuck, Hurley Haywood , and the queen Michelle Mouton drove. I could croak right there and be complete.
Love the partnership
Between the two cars that you got to drive I am curious what is the value of the two cars you got to drive? I really would like to know.
Wow just wow👍👍
these cars are why Ken Block became a rally driver after all...
Hoonicorn getting a compound turbo w12?
So.... Ken signed with audi?
Ken Block is better for the show than the compétition 😅👎
My Jaw bloody DROPPED when they showed the garage :O Jesus christ
Hey Ken,  Were you out it Tooele in your 5.0 Mustang a couple weeks back? Trying to settle a bet.
Quattro S1E2 MONSTER!!!
Please let this legendary car in hoonigan this vs that
Cant wait to see the next gymkhana video with this partnership!!
Ken looks like a little kid in a candy store ;-)
Timo: It is not open to the public. Ken: casually showing almost a million people around the whole world the inside.
Audi knows how to build a relationship with a driver....at least this driver they do!!!
Just saying it with the words of a rally legend.  Wrc is for boys. Groupe b was for man!
I gotta be honest,  I don't buy it.  I know he's being paid a lot of money to "love audi" but I just don't believe him.   Ford Execs are watching this going....."Yeah, he'll be be back"    Even when he drove for Subaru, he had more natural enthusiasm.
Ken Block, always good for a surprise! You are my hero!
The amount of mispronunciation German things is both off the charts and hilarious.
So he didn't know what the group s one was?
That guy had no chance! He got scumbaged by the two finest! Even he had doubts trying to tell them nicley to take it easy. Ever since the guy said the day before that ken can possibly drive the car. He walked in with driving in mind  when the doors walked in.
Audi over here making the best decision they've made in decades, signing Ken.
Wenn son echt lockerer Typ auf einen trifft der nur so macht....
2.5 MIL FOR AN OLD REBADGED VOLKS??
I've only seen pictures of the RS 002 and read about and now I can see ken rip it this is awesome. And apparently there was going to be a class for the prototype like design for every car company.
Ken Block mal bei Audi in Deutschland 😂
Ken is living every rally fan's dream. He didn't just get to drive a Quattro rally car, he got to drive the Quattro rally car.
On part two of our trip to Audi HQ in Ingolstadt, Germany, we stop by Audi Tradition, the brand's secret storage facility where  they let me drive not one but TWO of the most iconic rally cars of all time.
WHAT A DREAM COME TRUE!
Entering into the Audi garage is probably one of the most ridiculous shots ive seen ina while.  Congrats on joining the team. Oh and then they pull out the Ruehrl! Thank you #Audi!
YES! Finally some Donuts 👍
https://youtu.be/aORbHvMy5pQ
❤❤❤❤ love audi !!!!!
Have ken went Juha kankkunen home..? Where he have Audi S1, Lancia S4 , Peugeot 205 T16...?
Timo lost at least 10 years of live expectancy watching Ken driving those priceless museum cars
Ken you're the Luckiest man alive. I've been a fan for years and this Audi partnership is well deserved from your racing talent to your character. Audi is very smart to recognize this as well as the talent of you and the Hoonigan team bringing the sport to the people. Congrats! Cant wait for the next vids!
Damn..... 👌🔥🔥💥💥
Check out this car in Rally Cross, LOL
Timo was thinking “fuck I’m getting fired” through this whole video.
So rad you stopped and took picture of the model/Rc car
Ken was like a child again when they said he could drive the S1
There for a tour… yet they are giving the tour and not allowing the man to speak. Then, placing their filthy paws all over each car they look at and and poking and prodding at things. Horrible manners. However just proves they are all about thrashing!
That's so awesome! I just love what ken and the guy's are always doing. I so wish I could afford to get a rally car...guess I'll have to settle for Grand Turismo on my ps4..🤪
I love this
Bah-nanas!!! Amazing opportunity of a lifetime. I feel your pain @brianscotto of not being able to drive them also.
How cool is Audi to do this?  They get some serious respect from me for this.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good on Audi for this.
The fact that these cars even still run at all after all those decades is amazing!
From the time I watched this when I got up to the time the video was done Views went from 500,000 to 900,000 Hooigan n Block you Sirs are trending
Soooo cool ..but ...??..even Whistlin Diesel has a Fast Audio...lololol ....I Am SoJoking This Is Epic.... I Mean Epic N I Love Evry Second Of It.
The 5 cylinder Audi engine is crazy. I seen them running with motorcycles and winning
Man, hearing the spool and engine noise...its so crazy, that not much gives chills like this one. A carrera gt is up there as well...and then not many cars else. :)
Loved every second of this, but I kinda felt bad that the German fella was so nice n the guys were like Do You Know Who We Are....lolol
I love how humble and GRATEFUL Ken still is with everything
My A4 Quattro could be over 900hp if i had the funding to do so lol
If you're old enough to remember the 70's and 80's, Audi had a sketchy reputation in the US (the underpowered 100LS, the "unintended acceleration" fiasco, etc.) They have certainly come a long way.
We had the street version of the first car back in the day when I was a kid....memories! :)
Why they cover the flames 😡
https://youtu.be/m8g9wpTPZwU
Wow…congratulations Ken on the partnership!
Man i hope Ken gets to drive the 1988 Audi 200 Quattro Trans-Am & the 1989 Audi 90 IMSA GTO :D :D
@Ken Block you should talk to Savage garage they have a replica that they custom made maybe you can get one of the  Sport Quattro S1 E2
That pure smile and joy is something i need to experience in my life by driving my dream cars 😂
Lol that guy had his mask on outside then took it off inside lol lol
Cant imagine the what the Audi historic engineers had to go through. Hopefully they are alive. Everytime Ken hit the revlimiter the Audi employees had a stroke.
*_Gyhmkahana coming???_* IMAGINE??
Was endlich mal gesperrter Kanal mit Müll ( Autos ) 💩💩💩💩 wie einfallsreich YouTube 💩💩💩💩💩 mir ist alles daran damit daraus total egal !!! UND ICH HASSE VERLOGENE HERSTELLER 🤮🤮🤮 nie Interesse !!! Fahr Bus und Bahn
Let Me Pin Point Where It’s At On A Map But It’s Top Secret Lmaooo
Scotto, how many nuts do I have to sell to be a part of the content / photo / video team at Hoonigan. I’ve two on offer (& I’m a pure scumbag).
Badass!
That S Group is like a bottle rocket strapped to an ant.
I’m literally so jealous lol
Make hoonicorn 2 but with a Audi quattro
Kid in a candy store. The look of awe and disbelief in your eyes was genuine. Have fun. Have more than fun, if there is such a thing
Audi :    "No donuts"  Ken :   ...."How about a few circles" 🙃
Timo handled Them pretty good
the disappointment in Ken's voice. at 13:15 "they wouldn't let me do dounuts" I'd let you do dounuts in my mustang. come hangout in ogden sometime.
Épic moment! ❤️❤️❤️
great video guys. thanks for sharing. Big up Ken, that musta been cool.
Sadly....Audi will never make cars like that again. That goes for BMW and MB as well.
is R26 there, my stepdad spent 10 years restoring rally car R26 one of the non shorty cars until it became to expensive and he sold it to a private museam in germany.  I got a ride in it as a passenger and they are still amazing even 30 years later.
Group B when man where MAN. RIP Hannu Mikkola and Henry Toivonen.
Everyone who can drive a car is jealous of ken right now 🙂
This is Automotive history on both halves.  Ken your a legend!
Now it is time to make a personal remake of the Quattro rs one off and rally it
🤘🏻🤘🏻
SOUNDS LIKE PISSED OFF BEE
I think my favourite part of the video was how genuinely awestruck and overwhelmed Ken looked when they walked into the room with all the cars. Just like any normal gearhead would be.
I think thy're detuned to about 450hp instead of 550-600 depending on race-spec..
This video definitely makes me wanna know more about Audi Quattro. I used to have some prejudices on it because my uncle’s a4l has a malfunction on his Quattro system and can only do fwd now
14:18 When the e-tron did donuts around the s1, the s1's face was like ...cute But seriously, how cool is this?!?!
Driving the legendary audi sport quattro, the car that was driven by walter röhrl, on a luftwaffen base in germany. This is an absolute dream moment
WOW ❤️
i wish Timo could have talked more lol
It's all relative right? The fact this is one of the greatest group B rally monsters to have existed, driven by Walter Rohl, I mean, imagine that experience!  But as far as wow this has blown my f-ing socks off for Ken, probably not as big a deal due to the fact he has driven WRC Focus and Fiestas plus let's not forget the Hoonicorn Mustang, amongst many other crazy powered cars. But for me who drove nothing much more than a standard 1980 2 litre, Pinto powered Ford Escort, the relative experience would be absolutely mind blowing.
SSSICK
After watching this it just makes me want to jump in my RS3 and send it. The 5 pot is a beautiful sounding engine!
Lets buy audis in support.
LOL who's giving who a tour
Typically American  🤔
Man hat es geschafft, wenn für Deinen Besuch das Museum geschlossen wird und Du das Auto aus dem Regal nehmen und fahren darfst... Einfach geil!
This is why i love Audi its not the fastest production car on a straight or track than let say its rival Bmw and mayb not as engaging, but there is so much history and heritage behind this 4 rings and thats enough for me it would be a dream come true for me to be near these monsters, and im proud to say i own a Audi regardless if its the 1.6tdi A3 Sportback lol but im driving vosprung indeed
When Ken walked into that showroom.  . First time ever that I'd seen him go weak at the knees😀
Sure, they are expensive cars. But even though you can slap a price tag on it that reflects its current value for a collector, there is no amount of money that would bring the cars back if something were to happen to them. In a way, even the 2.5 million Röhrl car is of immeasurable value.
8:15 this Silver R8 in the background 😍
Fantastic vlog. Well done Audi not normally a fan of the brand TBH however you have just gone up 100% in my opinion. Sound magnificent those cars.
Thank you Audi
damn i am so freakin jealous :O Wallther Roehrls AUdi Sports Quatro.. Insaane!
omg that sounds awesome
Where are the inline 5 drivers?
This thing under stears so badly...just imagine driving that as hard as you can in the forest roads, gravel...
Watching this and previous video literally gives me chills. That's so exciting to even watch it, I can't imagine the thrill level to be there in person. Nice. Enjoy it guys and all the best to you!!!!!
like kids in a sweet shop
Sounds beautiful and good old-fashioned gear stick manual epic video 😎💯❤️👊🙏
Yeah why not cut the footage 50 thousand times while driving the car....
Epic video I'm so glad you got to live your dream 💯❤️🙏👊
The content is on point . Shot Audi .
now i really like Audi, bc they left Ken drive those cars.very cool company:)
you make your dream come trhu  congrats !  next step drive the auto union v16 full speed (without dieing )
Hit the limiter pretty long….😵
I can't wait for the quattro gymkanna
This video took me to an emotional journey from getting hard from the pure sound of these amazing machines to falling in love with them once again and wanting to watch hours long videos of old rally and the crazy spectacle it was, thank you Ken for letting us in on this adventure ❤️
I feel like car manufacturers are the only thing bringing world 🌎 peace right now.  Good job Ken 👍
Pure class lads.
I personally would have cried 🥺😍😍😍😍
Holy smokes
Watching these is like watching Ken Block forgetting he's Ken Block... so humble.
Dear god that sound
gymkhana with the audi quattro.. one can dream
Hellllllll yeahhh made blokes
Best part of video is when he let Ken drive prototype one of one and... "Can you read this? It says Just Aint Care." 🤘😅
10:00 that sound takes me back
This. Is. Incredible.
OMG
Audi let him drive the Audi EL1
This is literally one of the coolest videos I've ever seen on the internet. I had a stupid gaping smile the whole time. Huge Block fan, huge Scotto fan, and an even bigger Audi fan. My jaw hit the floor a couple times. So hyped to see more illicit content like this!
9:49 Hard to control this rigid ugly piece of shit Audi.  They try very hard to make it look intersting.    Not FUN.  Respect Bmw E30 M3  !
Audi forever
POOR BABY,,,,,,,,not
Ken, I bet there's over 800k people who are slightly jealous, but wow! What machines!
K_K_Ken...... THIS IS NUTS  Thx. The World Thanks You!!!!!
👍🏻  💭  What would Ken‘s reaction if he drive a Audi S1 Sport Quattro with under 1KG per HP from LCE Performance with Street Legal and TüV on Track or Autobahn ? Think he will Jumping in the Air 😁 cause that thing is more Brutality as the Rally Version with 1080 PS
I rarely use the word "phenomenal", but these car sounds are PHENOMENAL
S1 E2 has 300 horsepower?? Umm no,that`s just wrong. It has atleast 550 with it running 590+ for the thousand lakes rally in 1986
I mean its a cool partnership. But Audis from the 80s and early 90s are hard to find in the US.
As once a very inteligent man said: I dont want friends, I want Audis!
THE SOUND !!!!!!!!
Detuned about 300 horsepower 🤣
Donegal rally in a quattro with modern running gear???
Typisch deutsch: erstmal ne affige Maske.
6:14 build a rear engine S1E2!
yeah electric is cool and may be faster but my god the sound of gas engines is something that will be like folk tale in the future it is a sound that gives tingles that you feel in your soul
To short Vid!!
These videos have my jaw on the floor, and I wasn't even an Audi fan to start with. I'm starting to warm up to the idea though.
Bro now I want an old Audi
Ben Klock
The music at 1:50 is so fitting, I'd be crawling all over that floor leaving a trail of slime
Owo!
Nice people working at Audi I meet some people nice there. Well done.
The sound these 5 cylinder monsters made was just so incredible! A wonderful look back at the history of rally!
Hey! Ken Block got his teeth fixed
I genuinely believe this is the most bliss we've ever seen from ken😂 I bet his happiness level here was just shy of meeting his kids
The moment he said "yes you cam take those 2 out" you can see Ken just orgasm on the spot! 😁
Someone help stop comments from being ruined ._.
Nur am Untersteuern die Karren, Ken wird schnell die Lust dran verlieren
this is the best thing ive seen. Audi are so cool for doing this :)
Scotto at 2:15 says “Take us on a tour” Homeboy talks for 15 secs and then the Scumbags take over dropping knowledge bombs for 4 mins 😂👌
What kinda BS is it you HAD to go to an Airbase to run the cars?? The tires squealling on the asphalt were louder in this video than the damn motors n I barely heard exhaust, the screwed us.
the look on his face when you asked if you get to drive this now was priceless
Incredible to see Audi and Ken Block together, best years of Rally Racing begin now!
Now im curious what car will ken build/drove for this partnership
OMFG literally crying :')
I think u should try Hyundai cars for a change 🌡️🦾💯⚡
Why do we Americans feel this weird connection to German Engineering? It is because America's largest ethnic group = German Americans. Ken's surname Block is in itself  German/Dutch. The goosebumps we experience is in part because subliminally we are witnessing a home coming.
Excellent guys...  That group B car is awesome.  Thanks for sharing.
How long before he bins one of these
300hp my ass
match made in heaven, quality.
Scotto annoying!
Walter's Quattro 😵😵😵 He could teach you a thing or two about driving Ken hehehe. The spelling of his last name on the car is actually incorrect. It's actually Röhrl but sometimes it was spelled Roehrl. One of the best rallydrivers to ever touch a steeringwheel imho.
237 bmw fanboys 🤡 gave this a thumbs down. Amazing to see this partnership!
Smart PR on Audies part
Congrats on the getting with Audi Ken! Otherwise, I don't even have words for what just happened....😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Dam…Group B?!?  For real?!?  Outta the museum even!?!  FLEX!!!
lucky guy
the Audi dude seems like he didn't actually want Ken to drive any of the cars
U lucky dog!!! Unreal stuff here, didn't even know S group was a thought. And yes bring on the DTM AUDI's of the Golden Era.
9:36 the non detuned ones were said to make a whopping 750hp
this is awesome!
😱
I'm smelling an Audi Sponsored Gymkhana coming soon...??
Anyone else go to their local Craigslist page and reach for older Audi's?
He saw the video of hank iroz sleeping at the light then smashing the hoonicorn  Nec minit !!
No american deserves this
'they wouldn't let me do donuts' 🤣🤣
This is Audi starting the relationship off right with Ken. The best signing bonus EVER for a pro driver!
Ford has left the chat...
this is the best car video ever...that quattro is a legend
Great video friend
the white one is a total rip from the rs200 no wonder its a one off
Ken has the permanent smile.  Living a dream for real!
Shittin my pants with Jealousy !!!!!
germans lack humor but this guy tries
I stg the hoonigans are the fucking rulers of peer pressure😂
imagine mouton coming to Ken and be like "sup fam"
E-Tron GT is insane. Ken is getting one for sure.
Purpose built Group B car that doesn't use a regular car as a starting point, so, Audi tried to make an RS200?
Audi is the only company that had the balls to get the museum cars out of storage and let Ken do his thing. So stoked and can’t wait to see what’s next with Audi.
idiot spectators killed group b rally...by getting killed by group b cars
how not to get emotional in such place!!
have him drift the le mans car
Masks are for morons
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🍥🍙🍥🇹🇭😱😱😱😱
the start of a very expensive relationship, dont worry audi... its the best kind of advertising.
The museum alone was epic!
Holeee this is friggen cool man. These videos went so fast. Audi is so smart. I want an Audi again now.
car porn
That is so bloody AWESOME!!!!
@ 2:10 first thing you see is the LM prototypes sitting on the left and Ken's reaction is so mint. he's like (mentaly) "Can I hoon it?.. no wait..."
Anyone who doesn’t believe that hard work pays off just needs to look at Ken Block and they’ll realize that they’re wrong. Hard work and dedication definitely pays off.
0000
Ken Block and Audi seems like a match made in heaven. That AWD stuff tastes so good.
Epic
3:46, wo sind die Masken ihr Deppen??
That place is mental never seen nothing like it lol
RIP Hoonicorn, coolest car ever and Ken cant drive anymore. Hope he doesnt sell the Group B ford now :(
ooooooooh yes old turbo noises
Ken Block, you lucky (and talented) bastard.
Thank you very much for bringing this video for the world. Now: you guys already made an old mustang and Ford Escort for rally stages. I know what to do now with an spare Quattro right?
He stay with that demonic ass hat on bra Ahaya is king in the name of yashua
This makes me wish i was ken block even more lol
Most people, when they'd find themselves strapped into a vehicle that has stickers with their blood type on the doors, would question their career choice. Those guys were a different breed.
Leave it to the germans
Before this announcement I wanted to see the hoonicorn against the dahlback racing golf rsi since the roll out of this vs that. Now this partnership.. can’t wait to see what’s coming.
Was that the drivers blood types on the doors of the S1?
Damn the people at audi are cool haha.
What type of communist would put a thumbs down on this awesome Automotive video
WOW
Brian might be even fatter than Bert Kreisher.
Ben Klock.
Nearly a million people gunna know where ya hide these cars now lol
I don't even.. holy..
dispite me loving Ford I have owned 5 audi 5000s and 1988 Audi 5000 and Audi 200 Quattro Turbo so i know about the slant 5 cylinders.. Can NOT wait for the BIG 4dr Audi of the early 90s and late 80s THOSE WHERE the BEST ( to me ) you guys will see.. Great video can wait to see the next!
https://youtu.be/JJ8Op3eVcow
The Group S cars were something else.  Saw the Lancia Delta ECV in the flesh once.  Remarkable engineering
I hope and i know that Ken Block will get and make his own audi s1 e2 with new technology, i.e. adjustable differential. After that, we see something hell of a great and loud driving across limits👍 Thank you Ken for the future.
🔥
Nice.
Like a walk in the coolest toy's store as a kid but men size, for race driver or race lover .  Ken few minute later: And your actually going to let me drive theme ?!   Ken's next episode : And you still let me take more of those toys out ?   Ken driving a Le Man super car.  Me: droping mouth :0
The auto-generated captions think the screeching tires on the S1 is [Applause]. ... It's not wrong.
The sound of audi inline 5 its something over this world 👌
audi is such a cool manufacturer mad respect they let you take out those legendary cars for a rip.
I 110% jazzzed all in my pants when the walked into that room!!!
That smile says it all 🍻
Like a kid in a Candy store...
Scotto has more knowledge than the host????
So that's what Kens face looks like on Christmas morning lol when he walks in the garage
scotto gunna retire before he cleans another bolt on his audi
Historical ain't care level achieved 😎👀😆👌🏆🏆🥇💯💯💯
This is my first time seeing Ken Block and now I can't stop.
I'm getting emotional just for how amazing this is for Ken. So happy for you.
I am sorry but electric cars while fast just lack soul. A 6cycl turbocharged car is going to be equivalent to drivers as guitarists preferring tube amps. Or Musicians preferring real wood instruments over electric counter parts. The human touch, feel, sound, fun, and emotion is in IC cars.
Savage garage has that same Audi man there so sick and sound amazing
Whole episode could have been mute. Sh.t eating grin says it all. This had my blood boiling.  Thanks.
"Pardon me good sirs, but your race cars are too loud for the race test track"
I love how Ken acts like a child when he sees all the stuff lol
I totally understand the whole "corporate" model. Gotta go with the times if you want to stay in the game. I don't have any clue as to why the Ford sponsorship ended. That said, I doubt we will EVER see anything from Hoonigan as cool as the Hoonicorn.
Dang I wanna drive something like that... Forza Horizon 4 time I guess
I felt that Timo pressure ... xD
Good for the brand.
If only Ford was this cool!
The cars are cool and all, but can we just stop and appreciate how crisp and comfortable that Audi Tradition shirt looks?
f ...ing legendary
I thought the white audi was going to be slow! That thing was a rocket!
The white S1E2 (chassis 1) won the Olympus rally with Hannu Mikkola 23 years before Ken won the Olympus.
Audi 90 gto imsa is an awesome car
Very cool of Audi.
Gotta say, I hate working on them but Audi as a company is cool as fuck.
Only Block can drift an electric car.
Ultimate dream cars😍
R.I.P. Hannu Mikkola. One of the great ones! Seven-time winner of the 1000 lakes rally.
So eventually Ken got his wish to turn donuts :).  Nice one, I enjoyed this.
dont mind me im just going to do donuts around the 3 million dollar museum rally car. MY GAWD
Rolê top!
Big S/O to ken & the AUDI racing team...
can't wait for the next gymkana!
I'm so stokes for you Ken! What an amazing experience for all of us.  Congratulations and thank you for sharing the journey
i was on edge the entire video when he what sending them
Mad
Coming Soon: "The Quattroonicorn"  (Please Ken)
Top gear rally on n64 got me loving audi
The steeper windscreen on the swb Sport Quattro was not to give the driver more headroom. It was to reduce the glare on the dashboard that came with the more angled windscreen on the original quattro. This improved visibility in strong sunlight etc.
Amazing new videos, love the new partnership with Audi! The Audi team must get a good laugh from y’all 😂
subbed for this!
Ken you are a lucky man👍
Fuck... this is too cool that they let Ken drive the prototype. Tons of respect for Audi. I want an Audi now.
I have seen a s1 replica once and that sound is really the most awesome engine sound there is 😍😍
I see Gymkhana with an Audi in Kens future. Audi vs Subaru. You and Pastrana. Would be tits.
GOOD JOB! 👍💪
I know it is not the same.. but to build a repclica for Ken of S1 Quattro?
You're the coolest!
Scum bagging at its best. So epic!
Quattros nightmare: 2wd Lancia 037
Fabulous content 👌 👏
Sup
FAN-tastic
I think I saw Audi 200 Trans-Am Where is Audi 90 Quattro  IMSA GTO...???
This is great advertisement for Audi, if I had the money for it I would but the audi e tron gt rs
We need so bad gymkhana s1
and I am kinda glad I didnt get the new 8 series...
I just had to pause @ 1:56 to say how I admire Ken's humility and how he stops to take a photo of a scale model to the car he's granted the opportunity to shred in 🙌🏽
here at 666k views
Group B machines  are awesome
Toughely enjoyed the partnership with ford, now I can sit back and enjoy a stint with another of my favourite brands, five cylinder audi's rock, well done guys 👌
I wouldn't let him have a toy Quattro, let alone a real one. Worst rally driver ever
Ken best partnership in years don't get me wrong ford was great but dang they trust you with priceless cars. Pretty awesome
Oh man, you made an old fart petrol head young again , love that howl , nice work . And thanks Audi for letting your baby out again .
Timo you can work for me at Hoonigan i got plenty of non-running Audi's there ~ Brian "Carcaine" Scotto
i am amazed that a German would allow someone, let alone an american, do this with their cars
history in the making right here
Ken hugging the car cracked me up! 😂
It would have been great when Walter showed him how to drive a rally car!
Immense!
i would kill to own those cars
Brilliant ! Sound’  performance as classic Audi. Thanksguys👍
Wow! you lucky B******d
Ken block is a real car guy because he knows what real drivers car's are.
Sounded so incredible
Ducking awesome! Lucky guy you are sir! Blessed!
Yes, I now want to buy an Audi, just because they are cool people and let you drive cool stuff
Lancia is better!!!
Good marketing operation from Audi, now I want one!
I love how Ken is like do you have to check with another boss…lol
This is why I was estatic when I heard Ken Block was signing with Audi. Being an Audi owner myself and a motorsport enthusiast this is match made in heaven.
About time
I’m gonna need to see the IMSA GTO my guy
Ok, now this is on another level. In the last video i said that Ford was daycare and Audi was High School. I´m sorry, Ford is now downgraded to infant.
the sound......
This is so fucking cool. Those are two priceless cars and Audi is like “yeah sure whip that shit around” that’s awesome
RS002 looks like Treser?
I'm so happy for joining team Audi, the content will be insane good.
Europe does it best.
🎼 o…lord, 🎵 won’t you buy me… 🎶  An Audi Quattro …. 🎶 all wheel drive 🎵  My friends all drive Fords, And We All hate that ride 🤫   My BMW’s 🎶 X-Drive 🎵 is broken 🎶 so basically I stride  O… 🎶 lord, won’t you buy me, and Audi alll wheeeeeeeel steering……   ….no “drive”  damm! I ruined it right at the end. Can I still get that Ford Focus? 🧘‍♀️
I wonder if this partnership lasts longer than the subaru one kek.
I love how the prototype car that only 5 people have driven has a license plate
That prototype one looks ridiculous lol
Please do a rally gymkhana with the s1 e2
ken block be bowing like germans are asian or some shit lol
German Engineering at its best. Best sound of an engine ever.
POOR POOR TIMO
Imagine scumbagging the Audi museum
Once again I am sooooo f*******king pumped for this partnership! I can’t wait to see what they build for you Ken! The GOAT has made it!!! Much love
Damn....
OMG! So many amazing cars! I love this series! Im in heaven!
12:10 Instant RATATATA button
The ugliest but best sounding cars vs the nice but no sound car :)
Ken this is awesome!!❤️
Holey Shimoley!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Was that not the Quattro that world rally champion Walter Röhrl described as scary? I seem to recall that he said you had to take time to calm down after the driving was done.
1:50 you're like a kid who just stepped into Willy Wonkas chocolate factory. I don't blame you tho. There's more legendary cars in that garage than you can wave a stick at.
Honestly my favorite thing ever
that’s my dream too! ❤️‍🔥
Best looking quattro ever
Best looking quattro ever
Oh that fucking rs002 😍
Enzo Ferrari would’ve thrown you out
u gotta love audi for that! <3
Epic
Being scumbagged by Timo is almost as fun to see as the drive.  That’s epic!
this is hilarious how you guys still somehow scumbag Audi into letting you drive priceless pieces of automotive history
You entered heaven
Now Ken Drives real Cars
This is one of the best marketing moves Audi has ever done. It's also about to increase the warranty rate on their transmissions and diffs by about 75%
That museum is a great place for car enthusiasts...damn
Audi inspired, Short wheel base, 5 cyl hoonicorn drifting around Audi HQ..Coming soon
i completely forgot ken block is a rally driver and not just a stuntman
14:03 best part of video where the future embrace the king of the past.. Enjoy Respect
Savage, just Savage...
Seeing a fresh video of a running S1 E2 in 2021 is the best thing that has happened this year!
damn ...
Audi: 2 WRC titles, now premium manufacturer. Lancia: 10 WRC titles, now...Ypsilon.  Thanks Fiat....
My goodness.
Scumbagging just went international!
What a fantastic opportunity; even to share it with us! Thanks so much, Audi, Ken & Hoonigan!
This video is absolutely unfuckingbelievably insane!
7:30 - What an incredible moment, cheers for capturing this!
Wait... Ken knows how to shift manual gearboxes?? 😬
4:22 I am 100% sure that this is true. Timo’s face confirms it
Ken blocks just like a kid in a candy store
Still remember the video frome jp when he was probably the first on  to go down ther and film
i can see FEAR in his eyes inside the Audi Quattro S1.
have only watched half video and this is some of the coolest things ive ever seen on youtube
I am from Ingolstadt
I am in tears, you lucky man.
Absolute bs about why the cars shortened….. Peugeot came out with their 205 which absolutely destroyed leading to questions about maneuverability with short wheel base…. Then audi shortened…. That dude thinks he’s an expert
awesome 😎
As a German , i know this Garages allready but to see you guys see this is cool :)
Audi has NO idea how good of a move this was for them.
The Permanent Smile on Kens face says it all honestly
Never mind the like button, this needs a fucking love button!! What an opportunity 🤯🤯
So happy for Ken, miss him leaving Ford but clearly he is reliving his childhood past and nobody can be mad about that.  Audi gets MAD props for letting him hoon these fantastic cars of automotive history.
Have heard interviews from people who were asked was was the best sounding rally car back in the day.  And many of them answered with a little smile and said the Audo Quattro group b cars in the forest.   I can hear why.  What a sound!
Someone make this man an R8 hoonicorn immediately!
Wow Audi is stepping up here for some great content 👍🏼
Group B. The golden era of finnish rally drivers. ”If you wanna win, take a finn” 2:10 Hannu Mikkola
I cant help but wonder if this is research for the next hoonicar.
Anyone,  please what is the car at about 15m20s near end in the next video highlights. Saloon shape? Odd engine note? Cheers
"WRC is for boys, Group B was for men" - J. Kankkunen
Sick collecton and mr Block will be the best driver!
My dream car is a 5 cylinder
i think the last shot was worth like 10 000€ for the tires
i think the last shot was worth like 10 000€ for the tires
Nuts. Just eargasm.
Amazing video brooo! Loved the ending where you got to spin the e tron around the B. Amazing to see the 40 year tech gap.
My favourite car of all time .. .. great video and what a collection 👍
If you destroy them your a dead man in Europa!
Delta S4 anyone.........?
Need to get Ken in touch with Randy Savage. He's got a replica just waiting to be thrashed by Ken!
Yanks waking up to 35 year old history........cant fault the enthusiasm.
♡
:)
As supoused to be a life.... Fun and thankful...
Scotto is more excited than ken and he isnt the one driving 🤣
You take these things out of here?  We take these things out of here, yeah.
🤤👍
This is probably one of the best videos they've put out.  Everyone loves group B.  It's so rare you see high quality videos of some of these cars actually driving.
this was awesome.
10:00 Never getting tired of that sound! Absolutely beautiful! 🤍 💛 ❤️
When your best friend get sponsored by audi and you get to see ur dream cars 😂
I am so beyond jelly haha   To see that old group B car makes me so happy
I'm speechless too.  Almost in tears for the heritage in that room. Wow, well done
Group S Rally, the S stands for Scary.
dope AF.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
" The apex predator of the apex predators."
👍 to Audi for having the 🏀🏀s to let you drive those cars .
*Timo shows the boys the cars* boys tell Timo everything about the cars.
you need to try delta s4. my dream car 💟
Lol I'm glad audi actually has the sense of car loving to do this sort of shit, I mean cars no matter how valuables are ment to be driven not sit in a museum until they are dust, Hat's off to audi! 🤟
I have to say I got goosebumps seeing and hearing Ken rip around in that Quattro's.  Amazing.  Nice work Ken.
Bro  Ken is my main inspiration for wanting to get into motorsports.  I've loved cars since a kid but it wasn't until I saw this guy drive that I was like "yea I wanna race."  this is dope af.
Those RSes still sound savage af even after 35 years.
Can we use my comment as a plee to AUDI to let ken do the donuts?
What an awesome experience, to live your childhood dream shows that dreams come true. Don't stop reaching
Congrats
guys, a have been waiting 20 years to be able to get an allroad c5, now i did, so, can i get exact adress of this place, Ingolstad museum, cause im in Croatia, so if theres parts inside and mechanics as you said here in video, i could attack this place and beg them for quick one day fix, with original parts...
lucky bastard
Omg I love this shit ahahahahahaha I’m literally laughing and smiling looking at cars fuuuuuuck!!! I LOVE THIS SHIT
Hoonigan just scumbagged Audi. The brands are strong ❤
No car matches the sound of the really old Audi’s 🙌
Too bad it was de-tuned but it makes sense 600 unfiltered zero safety BHP is pretty taxing on the car
Ken Is actually human?..Ive never seen him look Frightend While Driving!!  .#FWDKEN
Ken ..want one ! ;))👍
i grew up in a family of two audis an audi 100 s4 and an audi 90 quattro 20v sport.And when i heard you team up with audi i was amazed.
https://youtu.be/DdmNYNkcwKE
Of course it understeers, it’s an Audi 😂
2:41 ken skips the cars that never get coverage to talk about things he (and everyone watching) already knows about.
it's amazing that the guy giving the tour literally has to say nothing haha...i was hoping to at least see Scotto attempt to fit in the proto tho...:/
here is  guy from finland building his very own audi s1 rally car https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzz6AEJRkO76iW5kZCSoNWg/videos
15 mintues of pure joy 🥰😍
The sounds!😍
awesome video <3
I can't wait for next episode...
Ken looks like a kid in a candy shop
wie walter röhrl reagieren würde wenn er das sieht
Awesome!!! So glad I drive an S4 now… what heritage
Now I need to see a Hoonigan car based on RS002 replica.
PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS GONNA BE A WHOLE SEASON OF RARE CARS BEING DRIVEN
Amazing sauce!!
So damn envious. That unbridled 5 cylinder noise is just incredible.
Great content!!
They dont look like nice cars to drive, he had troubke driving them, not impressed.
I don’t care what anyone says … Audi is the best to ever do it.
I felt that deep sadness when he told us it was turned down… like using a condom, its just not as fun
is this porn ?
Wishing you the best Mr. Block. Youtube algo has me hear. The AUDI representative has said a few words, but the narration of Audi Rallycar evolution down the line makes me feel i'm missing out on life. Thanks for the unintended inspiration. Lovin the passion. Hope to become passionate about something like this. Thanks and God triunify bless.
Nice
Gotta give a like for the sick cars
they both sound insane :D
Saw the prototype one of one, driven up the hill at Goodwood FOS a few years back. Epic sounding machine
So how does the rs200 compare to a modern day rally car?
Damn this is so cool and unbelievable a the same time!!
HOLY
+++++
Man I was nervous just watching him drive these cars :P
1:50 I think Ken is a bit excited
This is so friggin’ sick!  True Audi nerd here with 4 Audi 80 quattros and 1 200 Turbo Quattro at home🔥
That Audi Quattro is one of the best sounding cars ever made, change my mind
That S1 E2 still looks soooooooo menacing even now 35 years later. When Ken took the RS e-tron GT for a drift around it, the S1 had this look, this stance of "oh yeah, go around junior, have some fun. You have no idea what i'm capable of". This has to be one of the most badass cars ever made. The sound of that howling inline 5 alone can make most modern cars pee their catalytic converters. The hoonicorn sounds like an angry bear, some cars sound like WW2 fighter planes, some like machine guns, but the S1, especially deep in the woods sounds like something even more frightening than the devil himself, coming for your soul.
brian is nads when it comes to audi
Be safe everyone ❤️
Thanks to Audi for letting us witness this. The New E looks really nice also the front end looks very similar to a Silvia S15
i cant belive u was here :( i  realy wanna meet u ... i hope u enjoy Ingolstadt :X:X  (that's a really dream came true for me)
Dude, I so wanna see Walter tear up that airfield in the RS002 at full power.
Nice Car :) Bad Cam Qually :(
Literally nothing sounds better than a group B audi quattro 5 cilinder. Watch the old video's of group B when they are not limited in boost and rpm's. Goosebumps.
Epic wow!!
WOOOOOOOW
I would die to see that one day😍😍😍 thats car heaven
Ken, the master of oversteer, complains about understeer... Obviously he struggled to get it in the drift! But not even Walter could deal with it at the beginning! But he had a nice Teammate and his friend who tought him how to handle a car like the Audi quattro. After a couple of days in the woods around Arvika/Sweden, Walter was ready prepared. If it hadn't been for these two Swedes, who knows what would have become of this Walter... What do you think I like? Sweden!
Block block Block F all you hatters
When Ken drove Subaru it was Awsome, with Ford it was Legendary and now with Audi its EPIC!
Pleeeeeeeaaaassseeeeeeee get hold of Randys group b tribute car Ken!!!! @savagegarage
Trippin' balls all the way, KB43😀
This is already WAY cooler than your FORD deal!!!!  SO excited to see where this goes!  You can tell Ken is seriously humbled by this opportunity, that says A LOT !!!
F you Ken Block lol. Making drifting a 2022 e-Tron GT around the S1 look so easy & careless & NORMALLLL. Smh 99.9999999999999999% of earths population will never experience the joy we saw you experience
Epic stuff. Big up to Audi Sport.
The value of both those rally cars went up tremendously....
Unbelievable
Poor Timo got scumbagged on the ultimate level 😂😂
Exelente gracias!
this is making me love Audi, tbh I thought no other car company could replace ford for Ken but D A M N
I'm excited to see what audi will be built as rally car for Ken
I can't tell if Timo is an idiot, a scumbag, or just about it, to let Ken drive these. Either way, he's awesome
Your going to have to build on of those mid engine sport quattros
Omg if i walked through that door and saw all them audi's i would have wet myself.
Oh wow!! I’d take the job of “ driving these beautiful babies”. Incredible!!
music to my ears... love it
if this was BMW they would let him do donuts and drift
BAD ASS
Scotto is the Nads of Audi......😂
Wait was that a Audi rally rc car 😬
can't wait for the first Hoonigan Audi!
Ok, so I get to drive an incredibly cool, old school super car, detuned to the power of my V6 Camry…yawn.  Don’t get me wrong, love seeing the cars and Ken getting to experience the old school feel. I appreciate Audi allowing this to take place, but come on, don’t detune the old monsters for this show.
Legendary Pilots on Legendary cars...one of the best video 🥳🤩 If you like cars and fun there is a good French Channel  called Vilebrequin...fun video here https://youtu.be/I6qAZqgmAbc
Funny, how i like Ken, but i dont watch any of these videos, but when comes to european stuff im all in :D
Jealous doesn't do my feelings about this justice
wow this is so cool
I saw the F4F and didn't really think about the cars again tbh
2:55 Michelle Mouton's car, the woman who beat Bobby Unser at Pikes Peak and dared him to race downhill if he had the balls to do so, he didn't.
Rad! Did they change the tires before driving?
Yes yes yes! Audiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!
OK imagine you're in 1986 in Rally Monte Carlo, and you have to drive this thing full power with ALS and 3 bar boost, flat out, on gravel, with a horde of Lancias hot behind you, under the rain, snow, sleet, mud, at night, for 3 consecutive days. What kind of men were they? This was real sport.
Does this mean Hoonigan is going to build an Audi RS 2.5 liter RZR?
Holy cow. Watched this 3 times in a row. And I'm a Lancia fan. The 037 was David. This thing is Goliath.
What a thrill for Quatro Homers like myself.
Timo just got scumbagged so hard. Lol
Audi ober gleeben grooving. Def Block,...!!  Lol. outstanding you rock...
Duuuuuude!!! This is insane! Watching my fav rally driver rip my fav brand of cars around!
Ken Block understeering... Sad but true...
Ken`s excitement made him forget to change gears unless the sound of the limiter does it for him hah hah :)
Ken is probably like, what a POS this thing is. Slow and doesn't turn. Cant believe they were so hyped. Nothing to brag about here. Get me OUT.
ken probably went home to his wife. told her I can die now.
the sport 002 in insane looking. so so cool
Timos LinkedIn profile now says pursuing new opportunities.
YOOOOOOOOO
Twincharged legends with the legend himself
Dream come true!!!
The Audi thing made me finally sub
Audi really showed their colors in this one. Props, those are some extremely legendary cars! I’m sure you’ll remember this forever Ken 🔥
Thx for Sharing this with the public🤩🤯
KEN TEAM AUDI FOREVER
KEN! NEVER LOOK BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
pretty sure everyone stopped watching at 14:09 (and skipped a certain part of the beginning..) shameful to put the pinnacle of rallying and driver skill in the same video as some silly e car that is the exact opposite pinnacle.  anyway. moral of the story is we were all here for the audio quattro.
https://youtu.be/AuUyE_oJm-0
what a fu**ing legend! :o imagine the HONOR this has been for Ken? !! :o
Next one Audi 90 IMSA GTO please!!
When you watch this video and the add is for an electric mini 🤦
And quattro sales just went up again..
WOOOOOOOOO THIS IS INSANE
This series is awesome!
Randy at Savage Garage just built a group B Audi that is just like that for 160k ...was it worth it ? . id like to see Ken drive that.
Less Brian (like a lot less) more Ken and Timo Please
Holy shit that collection is beyond legendary
A modern day rally icon driving an old school rally icon, awesome video Ken 👍👍
⬅️Awesome ⬅️
Fantastic Ken !!!!
Audi: So Ken, this is the contract, the full amount of sponsorship will be…  Ken: I just want to drive your old race cars!  Audi: Just drive our old cars…  Audi Lawyer: Just drive the old cars, love it, brilliant!  Audi: just drive some old cars?!  Ken: Drive! Old cars!
Engine sound on the rally is iiiiiisane
300 HP
Eh, Audi… they’re the automotive equivalent of the golf channel. Best of luck, Ken, I’ll care about you again when you partner with someone else.
Can't hoon the old car worth a fortune, but can hoon the brand new car worth a fortune around the old car worth a fortune.  Me many confused, but also much entertained 🤘🤘
What is that masking BULLSHIT then you take off masks , how STUPID that can be ...... i mean no words
This is why Audi do it right.
They say to never meet your heroes, in this case I think Ken was glad he did, it's great to see someone obviously excited even though his day job is driving faster cars!
Ken is probably one of the people in the world
Those are some sweet rides! I had to laugh seeing the "Fuel Injected" logos they had on the sides of some of the old race cars. Back then it was a big deal, but it hasn't been for more years than most, or maybe all of today's rally racers have been alive.
Ken just receives anther 40 million subscribers!!!!
WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! KEN and AUDI???!!!!!!!!!!! = WOW x infinity = just imagine what the world is going to be exposed too....
I don't know what's more mesmerising:  A) Ken collaborating with Audi; or, B) The various disclaimers in the videos that make me want to pause the video to read them.
I always thought you were cool Ken. But now, you're even cooler! Cheers and congrats for joining Audi
Christmas came early this year for Ken.
Oh God tell me they let you drive a GTO
More!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good bro Supercar the good ken block and all Monster
This is AWESOME! Take one car on the Nurburgring Nordschleife track :)
Wow!!  Just wow!!
6:34 is that the Audi LeMans prototype from "03?
When they first walked into that room....I may have came a little....🤣
One of the coolest automotive videos I’ve seen, that garage man 😮 I can’t even
I picture a crazy Etron build coming (maybe based inside an 80's Sport Quattro body?) and then the beginnings of some crazy class of electric gymkhana/drift competition with Vaughn and the Mach E 1400? That would not suck in so many ways :D
I kind of feel there should be an “ILTIS”in the line up,yes it was made by VW but it was the forerunner to the group B Audi and won the Dakar in 1980.
normal muss da da walter vorbei schaun und dene buam amoi zoang wiea de maschin richtig funktioniert 👍
Audi is th3 best manufacturer ever 🖤 loooved the S1 🖤🔥
That white one looks like a Porsche 959 almost in a way
Starring: Ken Block, the son of Rally legend Walter Röhrl
They should’ve had a reaction cam on Timo while Ken was driving. Poor guy was probably shitting himself.
Wow what a lucky boy, thanks so much to you & Timo for sharing with us
Ken Blocks looks like if Tony Hawks had a Drivers Licence
German Speed
Holy fuck 🤛
How tf does 300 HP sound so magical???!?!?!!
Audi figured if anyone should have a chance to drive their iconic rally cars it this guy. His is a Rally legend him self.
Ingolstadt - The Volkswagen Headquarters of Understeer
Thats really a drem come true
TarumLüg Programmierer der Master K.  I.
This makes me sooooo happy. Way to go Ken.
just one word: EPIC!!!
There is one of these for sale in Sweden right now, if I was rich Id buy it instantly! But 150k USD for it.........100% rally modded though and in great condition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I-A8umaIaQ
We need hooniquattro
This makes my day, so cool they let ken drive it. Love Audi but i also love drifting, manual trans, and reliability so maybe this partnership will do good things for Audi.
Trops to Audi to let Ken drive it's heritage! Massive respect
Never been an Audi fan, but this is a wet dream.. Insane cars that deserve all the respect they got! Great videos so far, guys!
probably my favorite car brand and driver working together… DAMN💯
I attended a gt car race car event in NewZealand, and the audi team was very friendly. They let us in the pit garage film, take pics of the gt audi cars, while the cars were being warmed up before going onto the track, I mean we were just ordinary guys. They seem to have a very friendly culture. Now I can understand why.
I’ve never seen the S prototype running. Amazing. And didn’t know about the mid engine Sport Quattro picture.
man...new cars just dont have this "car soul"  of love and power
This is amazing, great of Audi to let you drive them
I have goosebumps. I can't wait for you to do a Gymkhana with a Quattro group B-type car.
Just go careful around the electric ones! They are exploding and Audi don't know why.  A friend of mine just lost the car and the house! Well done Audi!
❤❤❤ I love this pretty sure possum born drove one of these too❤❤❤
Cool to see but also kinda sad in a way that the auto industry is struggling so much that they have to let hooligans drive their museum art pieces in order to get deals now.
Audi's are so COOL
Dam i miss my 1987 Quattro
Nothing says we are committed to this partnership more than allowing Ken to drive these beautiful machines. I can hardly wait to see what they let him do in building a car for the next gymkhana.
Bro the fact you can take an Electric car sideways like that... honestly I'm looking forward to the future.
That quattro s2 used to have around 500 hp
@4:50 - "function over fashion" yet it still looks fashionable :D :D
So is Ken going to make a understeering Gymkhana?
Dope vid
I love Audi now. 🤣
Last seen the S1 drive in a Video from JP. Nice to see it again!
Come with the quattro when u come race in Kenya
No matter what happens in the video watching ken drive is just legendary 🔥
Best. thing. ever.
heven !!! :O :O :O
Audi x Ken Block are absolutely killing it!!
Ken is living every rally fan's dream. He didn't just get to drive a Quattro rally car, he got to drive _the_ Quattro rally car.
Выражение лица Кена, когда он зашёл в музей, бесценно!😅
One ☝of the great person🙏🙏🙏🙏 ken block ken Livingstone he is natural habitat great video blessed🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Not even jealous. Ken is the guy to drive these cars the very few times they are still taken out into the sunlight.
Not bad
do any of you yanks actually know a damn thing about WRC? At a guess I'd say no because you reckon this guy is the worlds best rally driver and he's not even competing with the actual best (all European like anyone who can genuinely drive)
I am loving this, wait, you are loving this. Living the dream. Edit: holy snapping duck shit!
I was at first sad about Ken leaving ford. But now I love Audi! They trust Ken to drive these high priced relics from the past. They are insanely awesome both Audi and the cars! 🤤
that sweet 5 pot soundtrack <3
@Ken Block When can we expect to hear the announcement of the fabrication work commencing on the ALL NEW AudiCorn, or the QuattroCorn, or Hoonicorn RS ... you get the idea??!?!?  JUST SAYIN' (wink) Please listen whilst i FANTASIZE WILDLY .... it not really that much of a bigbrain idea though :D Audi gives Hoonigan a couple of old chassis and an engine .......... we can all predict the rest  :D
damn, just damn
You should build a replica based on tbe quattro rs 002
The fact that he didn't take Scotto as a passenger made me cringe a little..
Jomen and power Ken blouk!!!
HOOOLEY SHEEETT
this was epic! The media machine is on FIRE and I cant wait to see where this goes!
This partnership is solely to please Scotto... Love it!
Great choose...didnt know for this 1 of 1 audi rs 002 Like too see on racetrack one group B and new super car
Poor Ken. Think about it.  Weeks of " I can't tell you.".   But it does explain the binging of Group B Rally videos. I guess there is time to change tires while the e-tron is charging...
Sometimes your dreams come true, other times your lifelong bff's achievements in life opens doors to helping you achieve your dream 💪😆
This makes me happy!
Plot twist: This is Ken's retirement plan, and he isn't getting paid. His Audi contract just said "will work for drive Quatro".
this is like a motorsport enthusiasts wet dream, seriously can't wait for the next episode!!
Props for Audi letting them drive these precious car histories
It’s funny watching mr cool act like a schoolgirl.
Just awesome!
One of the best car videos ive seen on Youtube. The passion for cars just drips from the screen. Thanks for sharing this!
Легендарные автомобили! Ты самый счастливый человек! 🤟
We demand to see the AUDI monster project!!!
okay if he gets to take one of the LM prototype class cars out, i may actually have to quit watching youtube because nothing will beat that for me
Never have i seen ken this happy in my life. i think this has just became the happiest moment  in his life.
When the masks come off
What a stunning machine, too bad it under steers cause of the weight in the front + short wb, who cares any way. A total dream
Audi Nerddddd
I'm looking forward to seeing what they can do with their own Audi car. Would love to see an Audi version of the Hoonicorn
1:53 Ken's facial expression
Understeer never sounded so cool! Love these old monsters 😍
Oh cannot wait to see Ken rip around with the E-tron
Ken is in heaven
Legendary car, engine AND sound of the 84 Quattro ❤️‍🔥
Certainty this is a mid engine hint from Audi. I need a job though if you're hiring.
Normally you see a very conserved HHIC Ken Block but today hes a regular kid in a candy store that got the golden ticket with Timo as Wonka and were all just singing in a world of pure imagination!!!
I didn't know that Audi also made an group s prototype, to my knowledge only lancia made such cars, the delta ecv1 and ecv2. Still what an wonderful piece of history on wheels.
Group B is the best
ask timo for the legend e !
As a Swede I feel pride hearing them talk about Stig :)  Great video, this made my day !
Amazing.
audi hätte sich keinen besseren als hoonigan und ken block zu holen ! gibt kaum jemanden der so medienpresent ist! i hope they let hin drive the imsa gto
I feel so privileged to see all these cars that I have envied my entire life. thank you so much 😁
This is so damn cool.  Getting to drive these absolute legendary cars. Amazing.
We saw the rs 002 few years ago in eifel rally . It was first time out ( with walther at the wheel ofcourse )  Too bad it started raining..
Never seen Ken get emotional
Thats a porsche taycan turbo...
The man is back
Просто необходимо включить субтитры!)
I like to thing that somewhere, in some parallel universe, I have Ken Block's job.
Walking in the first time it looks like Ken had a minor accident in his pants. (NGL, I'd have one too)
this is music !
I know ken appreciates how lucky he is but this is next level.
6:18 biggest mistake made by audi was to cancel the rear engine mounted sport quattro also too many shots of ken's face and almost none with the actual windshield perspective
ken gonna make his own quattro widebody
All we need now is Jason Straham to show up.
This is fucking awesome! Greetings from Ingolstadt.. feeling very proud :)
https://youtu.be/YyJwztBCDLQ
1:55 Looks like, the little Ken in a Candy-Shop. 😄
What a privilege that must have been driving those two cars. I saw so many cars in that room I would have loved to have driven OMG Envious is an understatement3r.
Jeder weiß dass der Typ ein Drittklassiker Fahrer ist.
understeering?? what is?
You know how monstrous Group-B Audi was, when even Ken says, he's scared of it.
Audi is so cool ! LOVE THESE
AWESOME, LOVE THOSE VINTAGE AUDIS!!!
Ken could drift a drift.
always wanted an audi. time to upgrade the Vdub and get an S badge.
only Audi baby,I heave a Audi A6 C6 2.4 quattro
Gymkahna in a 5 cylinder Audi is going to make me cry I'm sure.
Some big ole rocks on this chap - but don’t be fooled by the rocks that he got - he’s still ‘Kenny from the Block’
That was nostalgic AF... the sound of these beasts are eargasmic
And after that another drive with Walter After that I subscribed cheers guys
I just lost my mind, the Group B Quattro's are things of such rugged beauty, I was lucky enough to see them race here in NZ in my early teens, my father is a sort after Race Engineer and i was lucky enough to be his shadow, The Audi Team, Lancia, Mitsubishi, Toyota etc we visited through the years, but those Quattro's were so suited to NZ they have become cars of Legend. When an official raced rally car went on display at a Car Show a few years back there was so much demand to see it that the organizers were nearly overwhelmed
Nothing better then the 4 rings
Well I'm sure ken even thinks it - jammy bas!!!
Heard  sound of in-line five Frantically starts looking for Audis .
OMG this is crule
Love the trust Audi has in Ken.
❤dream❤amazing❤ legendary❤                     ❤ dream❤
Death of the golden age for battery 🔋
Liked Ken being with a US brand but they clearly blew that...and straight out of the gate Audi is KILLING it.  Mercy,  I never thought I'd see footage of that group B car lighting them up that wasn't archival and poorish in audio/video quality.  I only know peripheral things about the brand and occasionally service their road going cars, but they seem to be nails in motorsports.  Really looking forward to the rest of this series!
I hope some rich person is bored enough to bring group S back
Audi gets major props for this and just the fact that it was put up on YouTube and not some private event. This got me hyped so much.
I Love You Guys !  But it is against the B law,  to put on any background music when 5-sylinder Turbo engine sings.
holy shit, I just knocked the top off it
A mutha f***in gold mine.
Who the F de-tunes it for KEN BLOCK ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!
dude where the track list at?
RIP Hannu mikkola, King of Ouninpohja
SOOOO FINGG COOL I DONT CARE IF KEN GOT TO DRIVE THEM. I CARE THAT THEY STILL RAN LIKE A BEAST AUDI FOR LIFE
Würde Ken Block's Reaktion gerne sehen wenn Walther Röhl und H. J -Stuck die lebenden legenden vor ihm stehen...
audi for the win
Audi 👍👍
Just reading the title gives this video a +1 from me. I'm stupid exited! Audi came threw in a matter of days! Ken is going to be like a kid at the candy store!
1400 Twin turbo r8 to replace the hoonicorn ???
The understeer looked epic, wrong terrain I suppose. Still cool cars though.
Ken is officially the most envied  person the race community, congrats!
I love group b and was always an lancia guy but god damn lol
Part one was great. Part 2 amazing. And part 3 - at least from what you could see in the trailer - is going to be on another level. I'm so happy to see this collaboration and hope it will last for a long time.
i ran out of pants to change!!!
Why you guys are ignoring the Audi guy?
Way to go Audi! Super nice!
You don’t love Audi enough if you don’t know Ingolstadt
7:09 :D
It's probably a long shot, but I'd love to see Ken in one of the LMP cars... please Timo?
“Bunch” and “crazy” in the same sentence. This must be American
sooo ken when are you gonna build a quattro 5 cylinder hoonigan gymkhana car?
They'll also discover than in Germany, not fun is allowed ; performance is all about
Alright, that RS 002 was an absolute shocker to see.   I think most car enthusiasts are familiar with the mystical rally monsters of Group B and their incredible stories, and I think *some* people are familiar with the still-born Group S that never was. But to actually see a Group S car on video and not some grainy 80s photo was a genuine shock to the system, and seeing Ken actually drive the thing, to watch it move around was next level.  From a history and carcaine standpoint, this video right here takes the cake for 2021.
Audi Awesome ness, WOW to walk in that building,  Porn at a whole new level
Loved the reaction that Ken gave first walking into the garage.
Why Ken Block looks like American Kimi Raikkonen bruh
Put your mask back on jerks
Christmas came early this year, right Ken?!
making all sorts of gearheads soil themselves lol
finally, Block is driving a proper car!
Looks like Audi made that prototype car to compete with the Ford RS500
I love you guys. Thanks for this.
Audi is the grown up's Subaru. This video was great.
I am absolutely astatic about this!!! Fudge me side ways 😭 i never subscribed to Ken Block because Ford has always just been a mundane brand overall. Now this guy signs up with the ultimate brand on the market. You think Scotto was fan boying. Oh boy if only you knew 😭 Congratulations Ken, full send all the way from here on out.
epic
donuts 😋
Holy sweet mother of god
I'm trying to wrap my head around the fact that they have such an insane museum of priceless legends of the auto world and it's closed for the public to visit. Isn't it a crime against humanity?
I can’t wait to see what’s next… But dose anyone remember the other channel giving away a done up s6? Was that some for shadowing we should of picked up earlier?
ken is overwhelmed hahaha
Imagine what a good driver could do with those cars....
Scotto, your, "Killer B's...Suicidal S's?" is honestly one of the best off the cuff car thing responses I've ever heard. Have a meaning less internet merit badge =)
This is absolutely amazing
The look on your face says it all
Wow museum
Lucky you weren’t sponsored by Ferrari… Haha what a dream, you lucky bastard
Well done Audi 👍🏼👍🏼🇦🇺
This video is cute.
"They wouldn't let me do donuts....🥺😢"
Best part about this is VW joining F1 with redbull and now ken now I know it’s going to be Porsche and VW logo on the redbull cars but VW really showing the size of their balls here and their huge
turned down right LOL
Hands down, Audis 5-cylinder engine in the S1 the best sounding engine. Ever.
Can we please get ken a b5 rs4 to play with.
Even at half the horsepower it had for rallying, the Quattro still demands respect, and to see the mythical 002 actually move is amazing imagine this flying through the forests of Finland.
That sound!!!

My god can you imagine taking one of the TDI monsters out on a track 👍
The R8GT in the background calling my name
The first time I am actually jeaulous of the cars he gets to drive... The Fords ... meh. These .... I would give a leg for....
1 word ... ENVY
..and you guys said Germans don't have humor.  Bet Timo's laughing his ass off, wishing Ken wouldn't crash, so he wouldn't lose his job.
holy fuck??????????????????
AUDI love has increased exponentially
Richard Hammond should drive all of the cars in the Audi museum .
Full blown TRT in that garage.
wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Will we get new Hooni cars in new Forza Horizon 5???))))
Be quiet Scotto
This is an awesome partnership.
the S1 is the reason I bought a 1988 Quattro 4000 cs it was a BEAST!! I crashed into a telephone pole head on at approximately 40 mph crushed the whole right side front and it started up and I drove it a mile to my home. I bought the exact same car for parts it was a lot of fun back then!! I couldn't imagine driving the S1 dude!!
Shredding that electric around the group B legend was a epic ending!
15:03 you & me both brother
So glad to see Audi teaming with Ken. This is like a dream come true!
In all honesty, you totally deserve this
I would love to see him take out one of those LMP1 cars for the hell of it
Absolutely amazing. Congrats on the new partnership. Please tell me Larry Chen was there to photograph this.
So I guess we're all Audi fans now
🛸
The quattro s1 is my all time favorite car I would kill too see it in person.
I know you guys are excited but let the man talk. lmao.  Welcome to AUDI KEN!!
Beutifull historic cars
WOW! 👍
dont ASK dont get!! love it!! 100%
Very clever move from Audi to show the history of the Quattro and why Audi is where they are today by teaming up with Ken and letting him drive the coolest car from the 80's.
The sound!!!! Wow.
Suck it Ford! You wouldn't even let Ken hoon the Mustang Mach-E. Audi for the win!
What path in life can I take to get Ken Block's job when he retires?
the amount of good being had is very good
Now we need to see a hooniquatro
This is seriously the coolest thing ever. So stoked to see what’s next!
Love for the 1:6 scale rc car on euro 98 with some 2stroke oil and go go t go
Alright, I'll be dead honest. I cried a little bit watching Ken drive the S1.
Amazing and congratulations
The Audi guy was funny 😂
Big thanks to AUDI us fans appreciate them even letting them out of the cave.
Ye know....best part about this is watching someone have a childhood dream come true. Sounds super soppy but FI...
The levels of scumbaggery have risen almost beyond measure! I love this and the fact they casually let you drive historic museum pieces in the manner they were intended is immensely appreciated. Poor Scotto, at least he got to watch history being made I guess.
Yes
IT'S CANNNDDDYYY LLLLAAAANNNNDDDDDD!!!!!!
Video starts from 9:30
I love living vicariously through these videos. Makes my day.
Ach Mein Gott! Die Gruppe S... Schön!
can't wait to see one of these quattro's on Ken Block's brand new livery😊
YES ELECTRIC DRIFTS
The Audi hoonicorn should me a modern s1 Quattro with a new rs3 5cylinder
The idea of Group S is a terrifying concept
one word... EPICSAUCE
this was all a ploy by Scotto to get free parts for his Audis. its all so clear now!
The 1st Audi gymkhana will be the equivalent of when hoonicorn was dropped on us
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲❤❤❤❤❤
"They wouldn't let me do donuts :(((((" LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO     13:13
Let me get this straight.  A 1 of 1 race car.  And it has a number plate on it?  Only in Germany
Ford is junk compared to audi...  Ill buy audi before i buy a ford.... Audi ate soo coooool..
Do y’all still have some of the old hoonigan cars?
Audi is the 🐐 for this series
So what transmission does the 002 have? How did Audi make the mid engine work? I NEED to see it.
Was hoping to see Ken take the Phantom for a spin around that track
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
kid in a candy store
WAW! and thanks Ken for sharing with us your 1 in a lifetime experience! for the entire 2 episodes i was like WAW!!!! and i'm glad to se a driver like you to admit that it's an honor to be there!
I always thought you were cool Ken. But now, you're even cooler! Cheers and congrats for joining Audi
wow!
Audi and Ken Block will be forever partnership between them for the rest of their lives.
i have to comment, those cars are probably more happy to be driven to relive their time as if they have souls in them =D thanks for the great video!
Right on
Group B needs to be brought back, I have lost interest of racing cause of that ban, don't mention the f1 restrictions.... It's all gone south....
Anyone that thumbs down this should drive a wheelchair
Soo the grab a 500+ hp monster and detuned it to 300+hp so it wont break or crash ok .....
This is so awesome! After every episode I'm more excited for the next one, this partnership is epic!
What a job to have😁😁🇺🇸🇺🇸
Coming from a life long audi lover I can’t wait to see what things occur with this partnership!!!!!
This actually corrected our timeline and things are about to get much better on earth.
Thank You.
The happy birthday's face lol, it's incredible 🔥
I just want you to know that I have owned an Audi quattro since 2016. It costed me $701,000 and I bought it from Southern San Andreas super Auto website. It's great.
Those cars sound WAY better than 99% of new cars.
I love how even the Audi execs can be scumbagged😂
Its not often you see the group S prototype in a video at all.
Awesome!
Seeing a fresh video of a running S1 E2 in 2021 is the best thing that has happened this year!
At about 13:20 you can hear the depression in kens voice when he quietly says they wouldn’t let me do donuts 😂
Pure awesomeness!
DAMN that's cool! Also had a good laugh at "They won't let me do doughnuts." then later doing doughnuts in the RS e-tron GT around a $3m rare museum piece of a car. Perfect finish.
Seeing a fresh video of a running S1 E2 in 2021 is the best thing that has happened this year!
audi is priming ken 🔥🔥🔥🔥
To see these cars was amazing. To see Ken drive them! Mind blown!! Awesome video!
10:05 whats that cargo van?
I can only image 2 videos better than this: Ken driving ALL group S prototypes A drag race against the Hoonicorn
More driving please!🙏
Oh I hope Timo still has job
14:54 Lötkö ❤
So when is the HooniQuattro build start?😁
OH MY that Audi 50 with some rally kit on it!!!! Newer knew that Audi had similar body with others like that and mk1 Polo.
I remember when I thought Quattro Audis were the coolest cars ever. Early 90s
My VAG brain is jumping in joy right now.  Scotto could be a friend of us 😂💪🏼
Wow, 8:00 ken rubbing the goosebumps on his arm is wild
So is this a prelude to a Hoon Ecorn build relationship ? cool partnership. congrats.
THE SEXY GIRLS ARE  BIGTITITS.UNO THREE IN ONE YOUTUBE: THIS IS FINE. SOMEONE: SAYS ''HECK''. YOUTUBE: BE GONE Life's story is a short journey so have fun before sleeping forever #Чо #эт #делает #на #2 #месте #в #тренде #однако #я #люблю #таких #рыбаков .#垃圾.
So rad!
They were letting Ken drive pretty much everything but the F-4. If he wanted some real power, put him in between those J-79’s. Lol.
How old are all them museum car tires thought geeze
Ford didn’t let Ken play with a preproduction car.
10/10 Best partnership. Well done Ken!
thats awesome, congratz ken
As a fan for the Ground B rally era this just heaven.
That thing has alot of grip,dammn i miss my audi 90 wish i never sold it they have become more expensive know
Kens own custom hoonigan Quattro is gonna be sick 🥺
It is so awesome to see you guys go into a space and get the same melting jelly brain as anyone else.  Especially after the level of iconic status y’all create in the automotive space.  Cargasam for everyone!
Ok keep making videos with every single car in that warehouse. I'll keep watching.
is amazing, you can see that the s1 almost refuses to turn..
teemo
Sad Ken: They wouldn't let me to donuts 😢
Do they also have one of the audi EKS S1 in there ?
When Ken first entered the garage for the audis, you could hear it, this was his version of a candy store, and him hugging his dream car is pure
I love how ken gets so excited like a kid in a candy shop
🙌🙌🙌 soooo stokked you teamed with Audi
I want to see all the other audi's
I know it's impossible but can you imagine a old time rally driver getting to drive today's monsters.
Ken you are surely one LUCKY SOB for sure.  Congrats on the Audi hook up
Ken, I must admit I skipped some of your videos uploads. But after this video? I won't skip any! Right in the feels.
Congrats Ken it's going to be awesome
Beat day ever!
This is amazing!!!! To be clear we are gunna take these two out! Legend!!!
Audi is that cool boss you always dreamed of having
exactly what i envisioned when ken signed to audi
What's the point of having some amazing car locked away in a building? You gotta drive that shit so it's in its natural habitat.
That's so cool it just shows how much they respect and trust ken as a driver to let him drive those
Audi ! Audi ! Audi ! Makes me want an buy an Audi ! Congratulations Ken best vid ever :)
legendary
Great partnership and how many times did Ken have to change his shorts?
Totally speechless Brings me back to 86 and a boy drooling over the group B cars
One detail I only just noticed on 9:04 is what seems to be the blood type of Walter Röhrl and co-driver, Christian Geistdörfer, disclosed on the S1. Bit weird that this has to be written onto the livery of a car, but this is a group B car, so...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDe-0BjVfJ0
Scotto turning into nads is always funny
I thought Ken had signed with Subaru?
Ken, Otw the new Hoonicar??   👀

All that WW2 gold = AU di    Palmface
Timo is a yes man 🤣 best thing to ever happen
YES!!
i bet you still have a wide smile stuck on your face.
Audi is nuts
WOW! Just...WOW!!
Porfa siganme
👏👏👏
Ken's gymkhana videos made me question the laws of physics, so if they ever see those, they should know they have one of the top drivers this world has to offer! at their level, might as well blame the dirt the track had on that run instead of the driver!
These Audi videos have been amazing!
This is so awesome! My favorite driver is with my favorite brand!
Gots me 3 Audi 20vs for sale in Colorado.  2 94 Urs4s and a 91 200 quattro.
I miss my old 5 cylinder Audi more than ever now, thank you 🙏
Are today’s tires better then original tires? Spec wise?
I love u ken block ❤️
Wow .. way to scum bag the shit out of poor Timo ... But thanks for the great content.
What an honor of a lifetime. Goodshit
I never knew Audi could earn even more of my respect but after they let you rip up museum masterpieces, my respect for them grew another 100 points.
Scumbag level 9000 🤣
that where they got the idea for the omni on gta
@sarahntuned  I hope you see this!
Timo is like "ok settle down little kenny block, we are Audi, you are no one, you're lucky to be here."   Ken is like. Loooooooooool pls i'm self made.
Cannot wait till he drives the imsa audi!
This is PURE crack for us  OG quattro nuts !!!
We needed in our lives! Love this new partnership
What a dream 🎩❤️ you guys are such an inspiration. Thank you for everything you do and all the content you put out 👏🏻
Fehlt nur noch JP Performance im Video
Gives a new meaning to HHIC "Happy Hoonigan In Charge" lmaoo
Those tires on the E-tron must be like rocks they're so hard. All those donuts and basically no black marks on the concrete.
who else seen the missile in the ground at 10:51 ?
OH MY CHOSEN DEITY
emot api emot api
I just cried real tears!!!
Aint never seen a better scummbagg session... both cars??? and hes seen the videos??? Audi sales just went up.... Perfect partnership if I've ever seen one before....
There is something seriouslyseriously wrong with that last doughnut
We should totally get the Sport Quattro RS002 in Forza Horizon 5
MG! Leyend cars! such a honod lads! Enjoy! Rock IT
Next time, you better take some drive lessons from Walther Röhrl. 😂😜☝️
Great vid
Now I want to hear Audi bring back a modern Quattro and headstart a homologation ASAP.
Do u need editors? Why are these only 3 mins long?!!!! We the people need more from Ken!
Dude I wasn’t personally a big fan of Audi but after this Audi is honestly goated
- Group S wasnt a faster , more extreme group B , Group S was supposed to be implemented as a replacement for the dangerous and high stakes Group B , it wouldve meant a tad slower cars and lower budget cap with more realistic homologation restriction that doesnt involve paper thin bodywork or even its chassis - The Group S proto was built to fight the top dog of the Delta S4 and the coming threats of mid engined awd race car disguised in homologation suite , they were developed on the tail end of Group B , project started awhile before Group S was announced  - The Group S proto barely counts as even a Group S proto since the car itself was overbuilt for its group - like even way more than other group b cars , it just so happens to be still on development while the Group S proposal was underway and being worked on . partly the proto was supposed to be adapted to the regulation per Group S , killing the 1000hp barely legal awd rocket if it did - The prototype was draped over a design study body , wasnt the actual body meant for the Group S proto , that was never finished , or if it was , burried under paperwork or was too early in development , they just needed a body to test the car in
ah  yes. the s1.  the myth. the legend.  the sound you never forget.  all hairs on body stands up and salute when hearing it.  i sooo envy you.
This is fucking awesome
Congrats on joining Audi Ken! You absolutely deserve it. I wish you all the best, to you and your team.
Future generations will be like: Yeah, that car was driven by Ken Block himself!
You guys should've done a ferris buler homage, where you pretend to "borrow" the cars and then go for a rip....Awesome vid
Omg this is wild.
They are pulling out all the stops letting him drive some priceless car's ken seems so much happier now
Congratulations ken in joining ur dream team...
These guys just scumbagged audi into ripping a prototype
Ken needs to build his own group B monster like a tribute car
🔥🔥🔥
So jelly
Is it just me who feels bad for timmo not being able to give the tour 😂
Ken is probably one of the only people to ever drive an rs200 and an rs002
Has Ken ever looked happier?
Gaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ken must have been a very happy boy. Must be his birthday
Wow... I have no words, just Wow.
It was neat to see and hear that one driven. I'd only just heard of it a few years ago on the web myself.
Nicely Done !!
For audiphiles this series just gets better and better.  No one, besides Ken, can drive my museum car.
I like everything about thiis video.
Am I the only one here who wanted to hear more from the Audi guy?!
Can’t wait to see pastrana smoke you on a nasty Subaru 😁👍
Ahh yes, a 15-minute video of where to go first if I ever become a thief.
Cant love these videos enough. To see such amazing cars ride again! soooo awesome.
Can you do a gymkhana with the Quattro?
You gotta shorten these up a bit.  I didn't realize I was holding my breath the whole time until I passed out.  Maybe a reminder to breathe or something?
ken Block are you ready to  competit with SUBARU and FORD in really race!!!!! PASTRANA and BALDIWIN ARE JEULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!! from PUERTO RICO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm kinda sad that him and Ford decided to end their partnership
lmao omg the look on his face.... happy happy joy joy
I was just waiting for the Rain Sesion 🤞 but its OK I know that will come for sure at least for one of the high miles beater Quattro lol cmon Block!
why did him and ford split ties
can't stop grinning
"No Ken, you can't hoon these two. But, here's the new RS E-Tron GT. Hoon your heart out." This is legendary sh*t. Audi is legendary for this. Probably my favorite high-end European car brand now.
Very cool! Its great to see dreams come true!
this is so cool. big ups to audi and timo for being so fucking cool and hospitable. im already LOVING this sponsorship and it just started. lol
A drift r8 would be sick!
*enters garage*  Ken: *looks around in heven*
Ok is happening!
This is fantastic...this makes me very happy after a long day at work! :)
Fuck yeah. Just keep drip feeding videos of Ken ripping every car in Audi’s vaults!! I love how the boys are legitimately shocked that they’re allowed to drive them, and pretty bloody hard too!
Btw, engineers don't just strap on plastic strips here and there for looks. They have a function and everything was calculated.
Dude the was explosive, can't even imagine the feel of that engine behind the wheel!
It’s too loud to run on audis race track lmaooooo…… I would’ve had to have asked to drive one of the tdi Le Mans cars
Ken does not know what the white group S is!? For a rally guru and audi enthusiast he doesn't know the history of the white ghost is!?
Need Walter to coach him, how epic would that be?
Every Audi fanboy's dream. I'm just glad I get to live it through Ken Block. These cars....just wow.
Ken Block even drove some world rally championship races, as far as I know.
That’s a dream come true
After Ken drives these cars "gently" he gets an uncomfortable call from Audi...." ya we uh were not sure about the partnership...." i can only imagine the stress.
Why the hell doesn’t this have more views this is a once in a life time moment
Audi S1 got a good beating back in the day. Legends like Walter Röhrl, Stig blomqvist, Michelle Mouton been there, got the t-shirt.  To this day, Walter Röhrl would be up there, even at 74 years old! Hey, he even did imsa gto with Hans Stuck and of course Pikes Peak.   You can smoke the tires and drift that S1 all you want, but there is nothing more pleasant than Walter Röhrl dancing on the 3 pedals and keeping that S1 beast under his control and getting the stage or lap in the shortest time with precision.
This is hardcore... The audi quatro s1 its a incredible machine... Cars like that never more will be manufactured... Today cars are boring
pauses Video, plays dirt rally with audi with sound cranked
Dude!
these are the videos that are mind bending and blowing but most of all amazing
Freakin RAD
Understeering is more rant - you are facing the tree you're running into ;)
Make a Audi q3rs sportback rally car for Kent 👀
Ken feeling like a Xmas kid when Audi let him drive the Devil Quattro
This is crack. I need more of it. So much more.
Wow! So awesome! Love those old quattro's and the sound of that 5 cylinder!
Congrats on the partnership with Audi. Can't wait to see what they build you for the next Gymkana! RS3?!?!
Well I think AUDI did one hell of a job getting Ken Block into their fold! Probably one of their best decisions in terms of business and PR!  I think they are going to see a bump in their sales in the US.
Timmo Witt. :   Dream Master, Keyholder, Guardian of the Legacy. ... this man deserves a documentary.
I’m wondering what they do with the fuel systems on these while they sit
Literally watching you guys live your dreams, can see it all over your faces. Love it! Congrats Ken! 🍻
I heard Savage Garage was selling his exact replica of the 80s rally car...
Broo you can see ken's smile driving those
did you drive any type (A,B,C) with those v16 central engines ?????
Please make a twin turbo audi r8 gymkana car
first time ever seeing Ken without a straight face while driving
OMG THAT SOUND🎯💥🔥🔥💥💥🔥💥💥💥💥💥🎯🎯🎯🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊🧊🛢️🛢️🛢️🧊🛢️🧊🛢️🧊🛢️🧊🛢️🧊🛢️🧊🛢️🧊🛢️🧊🛢️🧊🛢️🧊
I think Ken is gonna become an ol new Ken with Audi..💪😎💓
German engineering is just built different!
Yeah, I'm 1000% onboard with this
It's great to see the legend that is Ken Block act like a little kid because he gets to do something he's dreamed of for years cool congrats ken
ken block was unsuccessful in the rallye   world championship, it is gods blessing to let him drive a car from SIR Walter Röhrl! ken is only a show car driver!!!!!
Hoonicorn and Audi sport quatro mix
the look on Ken's face when he walked in was the look of after all these years iv made it
That sound though
I miss Group B
omg this is awesomee my man sheeeeshh
I fucking love you guys
Thank You Audi for getting Ken Block
💯❤️💯🎯💯🎯💯❤️💯
People buying Audis today, need to watch this video as ‘required reading’ before getting the keys to their RS Q8’s says this former B5 S4 Avant owner. 😎 Oh… and that first rally car they looked at, FWD, had the same alloy wheels as my 74 BHP, 1357cc 1978 Scirocco.. tres cool!
How many carbrands would do this? More to the people please. Amazing video
The sketchies donut ever
didn't lose value, gained spirit value
This was an Awesome experience.  One of the Best of ,HoonBlock.
So awesome to see those cars shaking the dust off!!
🔥
Group S look likea baby Lola
I don't see any Ford Logos on his Driver Suit, Is Audi drafting a contract for Ken? 🤔😉
i went through and mass reported hitty designs for unwanted spam and ayu for their porn link and got them all removed keep up the good work ken its really awesome to see your new team allow you to keep pulling museum cars out for us to watch you rip around
be a good video IF only Ken and the Audi fella spoke
The entire time I watch this I'm just pissed that they don't have these on display for the public. Like what's the point otherwise.. selfish hoarders.
SO Justin the social media man
Holy shit. WHAT A GREAT VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!
Brian at Audi is the same as Nads at Honda. Just an encyclopedia of knowledge on the stuff they love and it's so awesome to see.
Ken felt in heaven then home ...then wanted to get out...just to try 'em
Just hearing the car run would have been enough... just getting it out of the museum itself its an accomplishment... but for them to not only allow them out into the sun, run them but also allow ken to drive... thats a true partnership and trust in the driver your chosen to represent your company
Good stuff Ken, agree it would be nice to see the  quattro on a tarmac stage....
Hi...    1.   Y do telling Audi what Audi do🤔.   2.  Let the man talk.  u are the fucking guest!!
Insane...sad to see you depart FORD, but it is a Group B car!!!!
thats funny, i detune this car in dirt rally 2 all the time. its fucking monster.
Timo is the cool step father I never had
I can die in peace.
omg this was awesome. im an Audi geek and cant wait until the next vlog.
Sehr sympathisch die beiden... Audi liebe kennt keine Grenzen!! 🙌 🙌
Subaru hates u but i love u
I think Ken just jizzed his pants seeing all the Rally greats from the past.
Dream car material! Mazin
That Rs002 looks amazing and it’s even more amazing that Ken was able to exclusively rip these beauts.
So are you Dakar in there electric off road thing or not. Tell us.
OMFG
Timo looked like he might have changed his mind after Ken was so enthusiastic.
The smile on Ken's face was fucking priceless. 🤣
Group B never dies.
s1 rules
Ken Block is like a kid in a candy store
I'm excited about what kind of monster Audi & Ken unleash for the next Gymkhana.
Ken Block shredding on a Sport Quattro S1 is something I never thought I would see! Congrats Ken, My blowing stuff.
i wish it was on dirt so we could hear the engine over the rubber
I thought ken was gonna cry when he seen the timeline of cars.
Gymkhana Audi is going to be siiiiiiiick.
Waaaaaauuuwwwwwwwwwwww... Amazing!!!!
This video is miles better than any EV gymkhana crap that will be produced.
SPEECHLESS😳
That Group S Proto is INSANE!!!
Oh my gaaawwwwwd!!!    Watching Ken drive those cars is just bonkers.  What a fantastic gesture by Audi to allow not only the drive, but to allow it to be filmed!
Audi marketing now 📈📈📈📈
It’s so cool seeing a guy who’s driven some of the fastest cars on the planet, around corners at altitude you can’t breath at.  Seeing him have child like excitement driving his dream car was priceless!  Congrats Ken!
Ken are you now sponsored by Audi???
The ultimate scumbaggin happening in that basement hahaha
🤣NICE AWES0ME_ 🍨 VIEW *_  *
some germans are very awesome :)
2 must do things for Ken: a Nuerburgring lap day with Hans Jochen Stuck, and a ride through the alps with Walter Roehrl.
Best partnership ever!
would have been cool to see ken drive that monster at full power im sure that thing is barely pushing half of what it once used to be
Seeing a fresh video of a running S1 E2 in 2021 is the best thing that has happened this year!
Engine noise captions: [music] Amazing cars, I'd never even heard of group S before this video. :D
It was great to see Ken truly excited and blasting his way towards another awesome episode in his career, props to Audi for finding the best man on the planet for this marketing gig. Now make him and us mortals a NEW GROUP B street car to launch an AUDIKHANA video raping German tarmac....and please.... not that ecoterrorist electric concept POS you released a few weeks ago.... Funny that Scott actually party bombed the museum talk with his very cool nerd facts. SUPER EXCITED, this series is gonna break automotive youtube, especially if Audikhana materializes and has jumps and 120mph drifts and maybe a 360deg sideflip 😈😈😈😈
Dude... you drove my dream car!!!
If Ken’s retirement was cleaning these Audis it would be with his drool 🤤
You know when Ken is smiling....the car is good.
Ken talking about how nobody has let him drive old legendary cars yet he’s got/had a Ford rs200 one of the rarest rally cars going
Someone in the marketing department at Audi said they needed to bring a little excitement to the brand... they succeeded
Love they put blood types on the doors of the group B cars lol.
Strong work Audi
You mean mr Pablo drove Audi race cars!
Sick partnerahip dude!  Was so hoping for this!!!
The way Scotto laughs when the Audi guy says to be more gentle with stuff....
Ken smiling the whole time in 002. Love it.
What a dream day!
Unreal!!! Awesome to see that 002 out!
"300hp" defined. Crazy. Still looks like 500+hp
w
So awesome! 🤯
Ciao 👍💛❤
Ken I love the hoonitruck I drive it all the time in forza horizon
In f’ing sane!
Ken's last sponsorships were great, but I'm really excited to see what he'll do with Audi.
Fabulous trip down motor sports rally heaven
Ken Block with Audi - how long until we see Ken in an RS3/4/5 on a WRC stage instead of his WRX STi?
INSANE.
What’s the first build going to be? the in-line 5 Rs3 (hopefully hot hatch) or the TTRs?!?!? Can’t wait!
That 5 cylinder sound makes the hairs on my neck stand up, amazing collaboration, more of the same please.
What a partnership 🤘🏻
Getting in some doughnuts was a cool end to another great video.
Goodbye Ford HELLO AUDI! Love it keep killing it Ken!🥰🥰🥰
Up to this date this is the best partnership!!!
Being the same age as Ken, the Quattro was the car that introduced me to Rally. So sick to see him in a legit Group B rally car.
I’d like to see one that Michele Mouton drove one day! I’m glad to see everyone is so excited about the new partnership! My eyes lit up when I saw the first video about the partnership between Audi and Ken! Congratulations Ken, can’t wait to see what you do behind the wheel of these Beastly German Machines man!
Scotto sounds like nads @ 4:13
Love the 5-cyl sound!..
I'm not even an Audi fanboy but my girlfriend told me I was smiling the whole video and I didn't even know it....
The RS 002 looks like a bunny but its a proper wolf.
Ken , tu no eres piloto para conducir esas bestias y menos en tramos cronometrados. Recuerdas cuando corrías en rallys ??  No diste una derechas !!! Eres pésimo !!
Forza but I’m real life cus ken is the coolest dude
I can't wait to see Ken drive a modern Audi on some rally stages!
Seeing a fresh video of a running S1 E2 in 2021 is the best thing that has happened this year!
Audi S1 Quattro Rally Group B ....a Legend....but only with Driver Walter Röhrl😍😍😉
Give up Subaru for Audi or what?
Ken is like a kid in a candy store!
I think that rs002 is capable of doing wheelies.
what's the best year for the Audi S4 and RS4
Best rally car every made by far
Actual pulled out of a museum car how cool of a day to have.
That rs is incredible.
01:48- Walking into garage... Ken thinking "Is This Heaven?"... Timo "No...This Is Ingolstadt!"...
Who tf is mentally hurt enough to dislike something awesome as this? 🙄 this is awesome!
So awesome. Can’t wait to see this partnership develop. How cool. Loved the Ford stuff can’t wait for this.
I wish they never Banned group b and group s , should of made serious spectator control safety changes like now and better car safety not allowing aluminium roll cages . Ther would be alot more manufacturers left in the Wrc now . Thers only 3 left now Ford , Hyundai and Toyota .
Love Ken and I'm a huge Audi enthusiast/owner/nerd! Love this! Four rings fo' life! OOOO
I thought he just went to Subaru not long ago?
This video invented the Audigasm
8:20 Timmo imagines being retired the following day.
Love it!!!
this is so sick, liking the change up a lot already
This is the most exciting crossover in the history of crossovers
Perfect timing build a ur with modern inline 5 bumped to 1000 hp. The world needs it
Ford fucked up audi pulled out all the stops for block
Drool
1:48  Let the record show that YES, in fact, Ken Block can get overwhelmed. 😂
Thank you Audi
Love the 5 pot sound ❤️❤️❤️
Such good advertising. I never wanted an Audi until this partnership happened. Damn you.
Holy smoking joe frazier
Ken and I love the same manufacturers ....nice!
That was that cool ken block's on Audis special
Thanks AUDI for letting this happen <3
Watching Ken literally living his dream, I knew this would be great !
Audi being absolute bros
looks like group s wouldve crashed harder than group b. that roll cage is so smalla and built in the body
Still one of the best sounding combustion engines that there ever will be!
doesn't China own Audi now?
Ken is the most lucky person on earth to get to drive the S1
Just amazing, VW group is next level.  I can’t wait to see what they bring to the EV space race over the next few years.
Omg 😃 heaven you have found it as a kid I use too love watching family rally driving dads uncle rally for Mitsubishi mum in open class g Australia. But you are so lucky I remember first time driving a rs was from my mates wedding at around four in the morning going threw the mountains full of his parents his father telling me too go faster awesome fun was like driving on rails didn't matter how I went into a corner it would hold the point mind you I blew two tyres. Then getting back into my old hnu12 bluebird felt so slow. Non of my VR-4s compared nor evos I'm extremely in wonder of what next they will let you in hopefully a gt. Or if you could have a rs2000 Cosworth running against the group b Quattro
These videos are the best reminds me of the hoonigan road trip videos. Also love the new partnership and they are definitely going above and beyond for ken.
As an former Urquattro owner I can try to explain the feeling of driving one: Understeering understeering understeering understeering  - *OVERSTEERING!!!!!* You simply HAVE TO drive these like you stole it otherwise it will just laugh at you.
The group S prototype looks like a fricking Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet airplane from WW2.
Audi is awesome for doing this. Makes me wanna race for them too. Lol
My two favorite things, Ken block and audi.. congrats Ken, great job audi..
Nice.
Sweet lord above......
LANCIA 037
Come on ken you can get closer then that
HI KEN Do you want a tech? Owgee was the cars I worked on. Deutsch Wagens Ist Sehr gute .
Love that 5 cylinder sound
'Oh hello...I'd like to make a deposit into the SPANK BANK."     (iykyk)
DROP THE MASK, DUDE.
Oh so this is what heaven looks like..
That audi sound is the best!!!!!! There museum is the best!!!!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
🔥🔥🔥🐗🐗🐗🚀🚀🚀
Holy shit that was amazing. You drove my OG rally dream car... hard.
Should have taken in the grass.
lol the detuned group B, they wouldnt let you near a curb or 20ft of wall that's why your at the airport
Doing a rebuilt title project on a c5 A6. so much more inspiration to get it done now
Sometimes, liking a video is just nowhere enough to describe how awesome it is!
As an former Audi Urquattro owner I get tears in my eyes both of the awesome Quattros and of the sad feeling of missing My Urquattro. 😢
Wow wow wow! Just wouldn’t know what to look at first! The S1 E2 would be my choice too though!
Maske an, Maske aus- lasst den Sch... doch einfach weg.
Oh man I love the sound of that 5 cylinder
I love that Ken finds models just as cool as most of us would.
one of the most badass videos on youtube
Scotto dream deal. What's next???
Ken keeps looking around like he's waiting for Ashton Kutcher to come around the corner with a camera crew!
Ken you and your team are the best I love that you partnered with such legends as team Audi love it and keep up the great work
I could literally listen to that Quattro ALL DAYwith headphones  . Be hard to hide the erection tho 😅 also , I’ve always wanted to hear a group b screaming on new school tech it just hits different
wish we got to see some of the other cars, there were some legendary machines there
Guhde Ken & PornCrew, Geil wie alte Männer noch Überrascht werden können, dein Lächln im Gesicht mega Nice.
Too much bangin' abaaht and noises.
*Ken just lived out every Audi fan’s wet dream.*
I want see more Group S prototype cars in your channel 😊😊😊😊
The sound those turbo five cylinder engines make is right up there with the very best.
GroupB Rally car Garage replicas build these if you want one.....Savage Garage just got one.
Ya cheeky bastards, overlaying S1 soundtrack from the 1985 100 lakes on A1 footage !
Nothing like a 5 banger bonkers how good it sounds like angry Japanese hornets from Germany.
I cant believe I am able to out nerd Scotto at his specialist subject! Maybe Brian misspoke, but the steeper windscreen on SWB cars has nothing to do with head height. They used an Audi 80/90 saloon (sedan) A pillar that is more upright, instead of the Coupe one that is more raked back - the height of roof between coupe and saloon is exactly the same. The real reason they used the steeper screen was during night stages the steeper screen on the coupe would create distracting reflections of the dash lights - this was fixed with the steeper saloon screen.
Glad that they let you skid the 2020 finally
Test all the group b’s
Epic
Audi partnership?! Oh shit, we're entering a completely other realm of content and badassery.
I dont think original S1 E2, Rohrl's car is worth only 2,5 million usd. In auction it should be easy up to ~8 millions usd with rising value in next years.
This man just takes two absolutely legendary cars into an German military air base and rips them around damn that’s insane
Now that I've watched the entire video, LOL 😂, Ken was like a big kid meeting his idol for the first time. The huge sh!t eatin' grin from ear to ear says it all. Congratulations Ken!!! Looking forward to seeing more spectacular videos with your new partnership with Audi.🔥🔥🔥
Complete sadness for the future gen who will know nothing other than electric ⚡️ these sounds are absolutely incredible
Just got to love it congrats Ken🥳🥳🥳
Scotto, you should get your Audi Coupe running and let Ken hoon it, just to see what whould happen. No expectations needed. Just get it to be so. We might be amazed of what the Boss can do with a "base street perfomance Audi" It might suprise us. Or better yet. It might suprise you.
First off Ken lost himself qhen he saw the evolution of audi Quattro rally y cars 2nd same Quattro that Ken got to drive is the sae car that is the reason I love aydi
Ken block is a damn legend
Looking forward to Audi V8 DTM video. Should combine it with an interview with Walter Rohl and ask him about DTM finals on Hockenheim when Stuck got technical problems…in the rain Walter dropped to back of the field to see if he could be of help to Stuck and then drove back to front… power-sliding onto the straight and with one hand waiving to the public (best allround driver ever)
Is Audi getting back into Rallying?
Thank you Ken n Audi for the car porn....
Man... this episode made me feel some things. Congratulations, that is amazing
Wow…
I really hope this ends up with them building a audi
Needa build a 5 cylinder asap !
Scotto just took over the tour 😂😂😂
those with the german f4 looks so good
Ken almost cried lol he knows he made a good partnership
Scotto is the Nads of VAG.
Oh man... That's it. This is it
Wtf that's 15min. away from me xd
I think when Ken first walked into that showroom and saw all those cars he low-key got hard, LOL 😂😂😂
Ken: “They wouldn’t let me do donuts..” Up Timo’s!
Damn this is the best channel on YouTube ! Sooo dope
Ok, what was that !  It doesn't get much better than this !
I hate You guys
Vicariously HARD. Dang
This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
Just amazing 👏
These are one of those moments when Ken gets out and thinks to self... "WTF am I doing!?!?!" So unreal 😍
Insane!
pff i drove both of them on assetto corsa :P
Next Gymkana location??👀👀
The pure happiness  is so awesome
Congratulations on joining Team Audi, Ken! I really hope Audi licenses out a BUNCH of their cars through history to PlayStation for Gran Turismo 7, because Sport is lacking.
Yo, imagine if Hoonigan built a Hoonicorn style S1 (E3?) Quattro. That would be sick, and the mouth of any true rally lover would just drip at it's sight.
sirr is back
My favourite brand and Ken Block.... the future is bright! I cannot wait to see what these two come up with for his next gymkhana car
Wet dream deluxe 😂 That audi 5 cyl. sounds like nothing else 👌
This is my only favorite clip!!!!!!!!!
Audi inline 5 > everything.
This is what dreams are made off. Awesome partnership, awesome cool guys at Audi... my perception of the brand has absolutely changed after this.
That’s so awesome!  Audi just made a fantastic marketing decision.
Kocham !!! Audi i kocham !!!! Ken'a :D to połączenie to bomba Atomowa !!!!
Ima get an Audi now.
@0:55 Brian saluting their new German overlord... lol, wow...
Well the next car kens gona add is a quattro s1 evo2 to go with the mk2 escort and the rs 200🤣✌🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
EVs may be eco-friendly and heralding an eco-friendly revolution, but the tangible vibe driving a gasoline engine is irreplaceable and unparalleled. The vibration gives it all away.
Ken is bout to do BIG THANGS with Audi! 😏
Nails on a chalkboard whenever an electric car is spinning the tires.
old men gets wet in their pants...   this episode is just naaasty! if I may say so myself lol Can't go wrong with some rally quattro
So much joy. Phuck yeah
Just like a little kid 🤣. Awesome. God bless you
letting a kid lose in a candy store!
That all motor audi at the end though ugh the sound 😍
Audi: We've never had to bin someone off in their first 48 hours on the job. Ken: Hold my beer.
How many world championships did the Audi win ?
audi goes above and beyond for ken ! that he can drive the Quattro S1 is crazy but driving the RS 002 is mind bogling i only once filmed a S1 quattro  https://youtu.be/mKwqfGSOjz0
Group n with 300bhp😂😂😳😳ok
What an opportunity!! So awesome
Please give Ken and RS3 Sportback Rally car. Please please please
Group n with 300bhp😂😂😳😳ok
WE NEED "THE NEXT EPISODE"
Best partnership ever. Well done Audi 👌
IMSA GTO!  Do it. Do it.
Yoooo. Lets goo Ken. Sick man that your teaming up with Audi, love it. 💙💪💪💪
All good but real  man drove Lancia 037 😂 forza Italia 🇮🇹
The Audi 5cyl is one of the best sounding engines ever made!!
Hats off to the people at Audi to let Ken drive pure awesomeness. This relationship is def headed in the right direction. Just goes to show you on how well adored Ken is to Audi. - Just Hoon It-
Cant wait for more🤘
Fucking insane you could drive those cars . Dammm what a change.
Insane 😳
Sooooo Good !!! Scotto, I feel your pain man. Sitting on the sidelines watching. This intro with Audi is going to be sooooooooooooooooooo good !! Congratulations 🎉
I can't wait to see what the Audi counterpart to the hoonicorn is going to be!
This is so bad ass, what a lucky dude
This partnership gives me goosebumps... FOR REAL! Thanks for the amazing content ken block and audi 😍😍
NEXT TIME! ON KENBLOCK BALL Z!
Und mit dem Apparat dann eingecremt Monte Carlo, 1000-Seen und Consorten. Der Geistdörfer muss Nerven in einer Dicke gehabt haben, mit der sie aktuell Containerschiffe in Hamburg festmachen - meine Fresse
Id have the same ridiculous smile on my face if someone would let me drive either one of these, thats the dream and Ken's living it!
Timo is a hoot! 8:24 with that slight head drop from getting asked to drive the cars today had me out of breath from laughing! Audi Tradition is fantastic!
JESUS h The Sound from the Group B Audi is skin crawling in a good way
Too many groupies!!!
Ken, are you actually with Audi now?!? Dream come true.
What’s the next hoonicorn going to be
Anyone else thinking ford RS200 🤔
Timo is like who are these stoned high school kids??? LMAOOO
I can only thumbs up once, should be a crime
Omg 🔥😍😱 such a huge Audi Quattro fan this is crazy awesomeness 👌🏽🚗 love it ❤️
Wow wow wow, this is truly amazing to witness! Congrats Ken and thank you Audi!
Brian reminds me of of Bert kreischer 😆😆😆
Dammit, and I only got two Tamiya 1/10 Scale RC bodyshell scale models.
So jealous some day I will upgrade my b5, b6’s for a s1 lol
Go Home Ken we have Walther.
Congrats for the teamup with audi what a amazing combi legendary Ken Block in the legendary Audi Quattro
Banging the limiter on a prototype ! Beast mode lol
Ken You Are My HERO...
👏👏👍👍
Ken, Ken Block ... nice to see that you have so much fun, Regards from Germany
I'm so jelly :c
Godamn they look fun as fuck to drive.
Love Audi for doing that! So damn sick!
Hand rubbing to the max 🙏👏
This is what we needed! Awesome partnership!
...1:48 THE PARADISE OF AUDI😱😛😍❗
Very cool. Now, let Timo drive the Hoonicorn.
That rs002 is wild. Good lord it was evil
love the shit eating grin!
S1 Qattro 😍😍😍 my favourite car among the escort cosworth
Goodstuff
When the Quattro flies by it gives me chills down my spine
So fkn sick and such a unbelievable opportunity 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
This is pure gold, can't wait to see how this partnership plays out.
Wenn Audi mal mutig wäre, und eine Rally-Manschaft aufbauen würde mit jungen Leuten am Steuer die gefördert werden auch Zeit haben sich zu entwickeln und mal was kaputt gehen kann einen Wagen auf die Straße bringt der auch bei der Rallye gefahren wird und nicht das Geld raushaut für Leute die in 2Jahren beim nächsten Hersteller unterschreiben . Und noch eine Sache Frauen sollen, dürfen und müssen können es auch sein  , hat ja schon einmal geklappt. Seit MUTIG bei Audi und die Leute kaufen Eure Autos .
Awesome!  Americans could never build a car like this beauty 😏
Holy shit. Incredible!
I just want to see the new paint schemes on kens future audi.
The Quattro sounds insane, almost like the lfa
That sound. Like Tom Jones having an orgasm.
Ford - no hooning the Mach E. A car we will mass produce.  Audi - hoon two 40 year old cars that are one of few and one of one
audi quattro is a living legend
Poor Timo looks overwhelmed by their energy, and can't get a word in edgewise.
Look, I'm gonna post this here, because you don't get as many comments as Hoonigan.  Hoonigan, you all should step up Scumbag Labs game, and find a way to test the forces of donuts on a car.  I honestly doubt it's that bad, you could then maybe test a burnout and a drag strip launch to see if they are worse?  Make it one of your beloved multi-parters.  Just saying, this would be a bad ass thing to reference when trying to scumbag people into letting you do donuts in their cars, or it could prove they are horrible, either way, good stuff
Mit FFP2 Maulkorb 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Awesome!!! Ken is in heaven ☺️🤣
ultimate scumbagging to get in those cars. cheers
Im so hype for ken and the new team!
When you know you are quite well known, but never suspected you were this well known.
This makes sense.
drop the next episode early please
STILL HAS A BETTER EXHAUST NOTE THAN MOST CARS !
The Sport Quattro is literally the reason why I removed the muffler on my MkV 2.5 Jetta. (I'll get a ton of hate, but hearing the 5 pot is just so good)
I know your doing the electrikhana video but could you build a mental sport quattro with the 5 cylinder and do another gymkhana?
Never would thought.  Dude try one of them prototypes.  You'll teach them what their looking for. What car are you going to drive? Are you coming to Oregon Trail Rally? Dang it if your not. So many questions...
Now you have to try a Lancia delta S4
The thing about these cars, they almost deteriorate worse if you let them sit.  Shit does not last forever, definitely not things with moving parts and wearable parts.  Better to use them so you are forced to keep them working, and therefore adding new parts, keeping them fresh.  I'm glad more people are realizing that.  We tend to put stuff on pedestals until they are almost forgotten, this is MUCH better
"I've got plenty of non-running Audi's you can work on" was hilarious
The guy in the Hoonigan shirt has no manners imo. Let the Audi guy speak for a second mate.
As an absolutely audi NERD THIS IS THE BEST SHIT IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. KEN BLOCK THANK YOU FOR APPREICATING THESE CARS AND SENDING THE FUCK OUT OF THEM. DRIVE THEM FOR US NERDS BROTHER.
The funny thing is, the Group A which replaced Group B, were faster 2 or 3 years down the line. The problem was the spectators, especially in southern Europe.
I would cry the second I walked into that building
A partnership made in heaven. You rock Audi! I didn't know how much I needed this in my life.
Seeing the smile on his face made my day!
You guys went from scumbagging drifters and youtubers to do donuts in your parking lot to scumbagging audi to drive there museum pieces around a track that impressive
I love how Ken is astonished that they actually take them out of the building.
9:56 The spare tire wants to escape
WRC Rallye 0 Siege, 0 Podeste ach ja und keinen Titel ,was ist denn bei Audi los ? Hat der überhaupt jemals einen Audi Rally-wagen vorher gefahren und behauptet daß der S1 sein Liebling ist . Der müsste doch genug Doller auf der Kante haben um sich einen zu Kaufen , und kennt noch nicht mal die Gruppe S Fahrzeuge  . Ach ja neues Video  wird bestimmt auch bald kommen so mit Driften und so . Den ganzen Stall von Audi kennen wir doch schon von JP ,und der war dann auch noch schneller ! Ich könnte Kotzen.
That's why I pay for the internet every month.
They even let you drive the Gr. S!! I'm jealous.
I'm 43, I think close to Ken's age?  I haven't thought about it as much as Ken, but I guess Audi was a huge influence for me as well.  I mean, I remember them vividly in rally.  Part of what made it lackluster for me, was my lack of age and understanding.  I didn't fully understand why Audi left rally at the time.
So so sick. I loved my B5 S4. I’m so happy you chose Audi Ken. I’m a Ford guy at heart but Audi is my second favorite company so this is awesome. Also I live in Utah. I would love to come see drive at umc if possible
This vs. That..................................
Please tell me this series is leading up to your new rally spec RS3!
This heritage needs to be shred!!!!
Please do 90 IMSA GTO <3
honestly those cars SHOULD be driven until they break. whats the difference if its just going to be sitting there getting looked at, not running anyways.
Siiiiiiiick
wenn es einer wirklich verdient hätte dieses Autos selbst zufahren, dann währe es Herr Degenhart/ 5zyl marco          Ken Block hat garantiert keine 5 Zylinder oder überhaupt einen Audi in seinem Wintergarten stehen nur weil es sein ein und alles ist!  meiner Meinung könnt ihr euch .. ... ..... ..... Audi Tradition ( den rest kann sich jeder selbst denken)  unn einer musste das doch mal sagen!
Ken, the Audi ur Quattros are amazing, but you’re missing the mark in the electric, rest drive a Tesla Model 3 Performance in Track Mode, you can toggle off all the traction control, set the front rear bias, it’s way lighter and faster than the Audi eTron, you need to experience what you’re missing. If you want a fast electric boat like the Audi,  get a Tesla Model 3 Plaid, it’s the fastest on the road, and also rips on a track. But track mode is not released yet, so for a track tool, Model 3 Performance is still king.
I don't think Audi could of chose a better design consultant than the HHIC, well done VAG  🙌
I didn't think I could ever smash a like button with such force!!!
OMG so cool. Next Episode please. Fast! hehehehe
WhollyWOW!!!! SMFH!!! 😲
next ken block build should be a quattro with custom fab kit on it... make it happen
ken! every one of those cars has a knob on the dash with 7 positions. set the knob to 1 or 2 for full race mode! if knob is set on anything higher your in a lesser power mode. 1-3 is various states of tune for racing, 4-6 is for pace car mode and 7 is pit lane mode. i know this because i have the factory bosch/audi data sheets and chip reads from the motronic MP1.7 ECU in hurley haywoods #44 audi 200 trans am car and disassebled the operating code. all cars used motronic MP1.7 or the bosch motorsport V2 ECU.
I love that Audi called their concept the RS002 and Ford had their RS200
the next thing block would ask: do you overnight to the United States? Audi: Lufthansa  Ken block: really audi: NEIN!!!
😍
8:48 Sport Audi Quattro season 1 episode 2.
So cool. Congratulations Ken
I swear it looked like Ken went Mitch Hedgburg tripping acid frolicking thru a flower garden in Amsterdam. When he walked into the car layer
V8 DTM 😍
Ford , Subaru , Audi , Walter schicke den nach Hause und gut ist !!!!!!!!!!
this must be one of the hardest carporns ever made...so filthy...in the most positive way...
Insanity
Sick livery on that number 4 car.
MUCH SUPPORT🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
This Is What I'm talking About Boiii🔥🔥🔥
Here it is been waiting
love it!!! and your face when you first entered the room with all the cars was priceless!!!   i can only imagine the joy you were feeling right then!!!   what an absolute treasure trove that place is!!
A school boy's wet dream for sure .... Ken your a lucky barstuard !!!!!
Dream come true ❤️
Seeing Ken brought to tears was something else.
Best dam partnership Ever👊🏾💯
An auto enthusiast's wet dreams!
I’d be asking to drive a Le Mans car instead lol
Sie geben ein echtes Walter Roehrl Auto Ken Block😠😡🤬Audi ist auch gar nix mehr heilig!
cool video
yea the Quattro S1 might be detuned down too 300 hp but still sounds like it has 700 hp. and the rs002 is just pure p*rn in my ears well both of them are
This is so cool and reminds me so much back, this is the real sh*t, this is Roehrl and Geistdorfer stuff, this is five-cylinders sound - everything!! Ken and team, you guys are the best.
Okay I normally love y'alls editors but who ever put music behind the Quattros running deserves to be fired, let me hear the actual 5 cylinder music
I hope Audi builds a special Quattro for Ken. Mid engine 630 HP just like the prototype that got spotted early. a 1 of 1 no one has ever seen or had. A mix between group S and group B
The group b car was and is still my dream so much that I bought the Lego kit to build and set up on my shelf to look at everyday 🥰
Cool!
Imagine Ken driving a GT40!
No engine beats this sound
Props to Audi for letting the cars out to play with Ken 👍👍👍
Holy shit let’s go
Excitement level over 9000!
Ken and team why not build the sport Quattro s1 mid engine prototype that never saw the light of “ain’t care” attitude  and use it for THE next gymkana
FANTASTIC!!!!! The Sport Quattro is one of my favourites! I would love to visit that museum/storage facility!! This made me grin!!!! 👌🏼
This is some of the best stuff!
Peak life*
Brian Scott seems like a fake friend idk why
That is INSANE! Audi, Ken Block, I love you guys.
Gymkhana 2023 @ Audi S1 Pikespeak E , a New built E-CAR bei Hoonigan: i think i Like it alot xD
Damn just to see these cars os a dream come true
Ken is now officially the chosen one.
Holy shiiiiiiiiiiii 😍😍😍😍
Epic! Audi + Ken 🔥 🔥
Wings bigger than the Groupe S it sits on lol
Thanks For Keepin The Dream ALiVE!!! Lets GOoo!!!
My tour guide didn't get to say anything :(
Bad ass
Rs e-tron... I'm gonna do donuts around you 😋  S1.... You go girl 😉
Omg!  How great is Audi!  Already a fan and owner, but now I'm impressed.
Scumbagging yourself into those 2 cars has gotta be the biggest flex of all time....
that audi e-tron burns rubber so hard it doesn't leave marks on the pavement it just disintegrates them
The Subaru return didn't last long....
Coolest thing ever..
The Smile on Ken's Face is Awe
Ken If you really want one go to Group B garage and they will build you that Audi
Like a kid on christmas morning....awesome......🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
If its a one of one car, and its value is a couple million dollars, and Mr. Block hoon's it the value should only go up substantially. Just my opinion of course.
kind of surprised that they don't let you do donuts, would be sick to do donuts and make the audi logo with them.
An Audi wet dream! OK, now I'm officially envious. Damn it, Ken, you can't have all of  the fun! Move over and let me get a few laps in. lol  Lucky bastard!
that car sounds glorious
Can't do donuts in them but... you can do donuts around them lol ..Audi
This colab is the most exciting thing in motorsports for a long time.
Still sounds like death coming for you detuned
I've never been more hyped in my life. Two of the most dangerous names in motorsport are now united. Watching this gave me chills.
I've never seen that white tiny concept Audi car omg!
wow awsome!!! 1st time ever in my life i see te rs002 driven!! It is really cool from Audi!  enjoy your venture!
This new relationship will be a win-win for Audi and Ken Block.
The sound of that i5 is on another level. 🤯
You give an American to drive a manual gearbox car rest in peace to the clutch and gearbox
Fahren kann Ken , aber Walter würde in an jeder Kurve 2 sec. davon fahren :P
Can’t believe the old Le Mans prototype are there too like the R10 TDI over there on the other side from the rally cars
Welcome to Audi 😈🔥
if his experience with Ford is any indication, in a couple years he’ll be shredding his own beast of a Sport Quattro S1 E2 in a bunch of Gymkhana shorts. that would be SICK.   i’m super happy for you Ken! congrats on the partnership!
"... if we all agree that we get a little bit smooth and more gentle....  "  - pffft
One of the coolest videos I have ever seen.
Sooo…ummm…yeah, you’re gonna build one of those Ur-Quattro’s for Hooning now, right?👀
The tour guide is so confused
I couldn’t stop smiling as he got to drive these museum kept car 🤯😁
Timo is probably regretting all of his life decisions up to this point. haha
Awsome
How do you like the s1 vs the rs200?
You guys should build like a cossie v2 kinda sportqauttro. Modern handling with audi 5 pot sounds
This is propably the best partnership in world. Thank You!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Incredible. Lucky lucky boy.
I can't work out what Audi get from this ? Ken to get a Audi WEC Hypercar seat in 2023?.. Whahahahah..
hail!!!!
Got the ur :D best money ever spent
2:06 Hannu Mikkola, the Master of the Quattros. RIP His gravestone has a silhouette of a Quattro S1 !!
Hoonatic
Wow.
oh man, a big fan who's driving his 7th Audi right now over the past 30 years. Love it! Why didn't I go work for Hoonigan !?
I'd give anything to drive a Sport quattro s1
Ken is the BOSS
Absolutely sick!!! No other words to say!!!
imagine being Audi and all like: "yes, these people want to drive that car... who are they? oh, Hoonigan. You know them? oh, okay... yes, I can bring your blood pressure meds to your office."
I want to see what Ken and the Hoonigan crew would do with a new rs6!
One of my favourite hoonigan videos for a long time
Great stuff love it . Big Audi fan.
Where is this mythical place?
Such an incredible Video. The S1 is so nice.
This is hands down the best thing to ever happen between America 🇺🇸 & Germany 🇩🇪
What a smart move on Audi's part.
Quattro group B its a saint grial. but drive that beast its touch heaven...... congrats Ken.
WOW so amazing!
Danke audi
This is the best business decision Audi and Ken have ever made.
Im just mind blown that they made a rear engine sport quattro
Thank God the RS002 never raced, it look awful. Obviously styled by a committee and not by a Brit!
Dude. I mean. Ken must now build some sick Audi in hoonigan sick kind a way!!
I was looking at that r8 the entire time
14:49 I clenched
I always thought you were cool Ken. But now, you're even cooler! Cheers and congrats for joining Audi
This is why I still love Audi so much, they are totally cool with letting Ken The Block take out their two most rare and interesting vehicles in that room and let him drive them! That is just so cool!
Congrats on the Partnership and I've Grown to love Audis over time BMW had my heart but Audi has my soul
You guys scum bagged Timo so hard 😂 Ken, "so we are going to go drive these today?....🤔"
Congratulations sir . You and your team look so happy . You guys deserve nothing but the best and we as fan's couldn't be much happier. God bless and stay safe.
I’ve been badgering you on social media about hooning the S1. With it’s history, consider that request filled.    Hopefully you can build an S1 to thrash on and take to historic rallies like the RS200 👊🏻
Absolutely amazing!  Soooooo bloody cool! Go Audi!!!!!! Speechless.
I love these videos.
Before you read this know that I am a man of men...  however, in the first clip of eargasmic noises I literally had tears running down my cheeks 🤣. Thank you both Hoonigan and Audi for these, Ken I also have never been so jelly of you my man 👊
Yo I’m waiting for that Ken block livery on a classic Quattro!!!
By far my favorite episode yet just because from the combo of the last one and this one and seeing Ken get all excited and showing more of his real personal self in ways just makes it even better it’s amazing seeing that side of him🤘
Wow i can't wait for the next gymkhana, lets hope they build a sick 5 pot Turbo 😍 with sick antilag.
… the more vertical windscreen (from the Audi 80) of the sport quattro was a driver request to decrease glare and reflections on the windscreen, nothing to do with ‘head space’ … 🙄
Very nice of Audi HQ in Ingolstadt, Germany.
WOW. What a fucking treat.
omg its good to see a museum car like these driven like they are meant to be.
One of the Best sounding 5 Cylinders cars ever Made other then the Volvo S60/V70R  (Car Porn)! Hats off to Audi for letting them do this!
Best car company in the world <3
OMG! died and gone to heaven :)
I am living out my dreams since i was a child through you Mr Block,. Thank you so so so very much for deciding to embark on this awesome adventure!!! Keep up the great work and good luck on the journey !
Let the hAUDIgan begin
super vergas ken !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I imagine Audi as Adam sandler staring at Ken block,their rough opal,whispering 'this is how I win'
Anyone else thinking a Group B Gymkhana video?
Well done mate you made it ✌
just imagine
The sound of those cars is insane. I could listen to that all day long.
i like this timo guy, bring him to AMERICA
Man this is a real treat being able to see these cars man. Even just as a viewer. Can’t imagine in real life.
I would probably have to have the E-Tron over a Tesla because you can actually turn the traction control off and do donuts
I just couldn’t stop smiling at this. Such an awesome video and glad we got to see the Group S car in action!
Wow just wow
Of course we need a hoonisized version of the Audi ski jump ad!  Waiting…
So mamy amazing racecars but everyone only focuses on the quattro
I love you guys!
Lucky SOB!
So when is ken gonna build his own?
Poor Timo 😁 respect to Audi for letting cars be driven💪👌
It would be very intresting to see Walther and Ken drive the same car on the same track. I think Ken crys on the end...
In this video Ken is kid in the toys'R'us
MY DUDES- THANK YOU! It’s like I’m living my own episode of #whatif You guys have created a new multiverse.   Your formula of MAYHAM X INTELLIGENCE is just an absolute joy. NEVER STOP!   THE FUTURE IS WINNING
Surprised Ken got to drive the 'unicorn' RS 002 but then they go and dump that preview at the end and I get all fluttery at the thought that he'd get to drive one of the IMSA or Trans-Am Quattros.
Never seen Ken get emotional, and he was a kid in a candy store walking into that garage. A true purist.
So much cooler than a Ford Fiesta. Excited for Block and Audi’s future!
"Can i hoon it?" "Yes" "have you seen my videos"
Ich freu mich so sehr da drüber das ihr hier in Deutschland bei uns seid und dann noch bei Audi. Respekt, mega!! 👌🖤❤️💛
god that ra002 is amazing
😎
Ouuuuh yeah Ken. Next time with the V8 DTM.. and next is the imsa GTO? Wuhuuuuu.
Yo Ken, if you come to Düsseldorf, please tell me where you at and at what time, I'ma show you my city if you want.....
This partnership is awesome! Can’t wait to see gymkhana, hopefully in Germany, with only the sound of tires dying.
a dream come true, ken is a living legend, living our dreams for us, thanks ken as a audi/vw nerd this makes me tear up in joy to see theses cars actually being driven
Omg I wanna cry and giggle at the same time from how cool this is
I love these Audi-Block partner videos. Really good stuff. Cheers to Audi for letting those out of the museum.
Love it
Absolute legend! born on the same day as ken! that s1 is a bad muhfuka
14:41 Sorry, but thats too much! Why did they even allow him to do donuts around the S1? At 14:49 he even almost crashed into it!
And they say Germans are not fun.
Wow Ken you must have been in heaven. I know I would have been for sure! Those are my all-time favorite race cars. Being a rally driver has been my nightly dream since I was 6 then at 10 years old I "borrowed" my dad's 86 IROC while he was off island, taught myself how to drive manual and then figured out counter steer bombing around my neighborhood that had really smooth cinder road's with super long chicanes. I ended up running it out of gas and both rear tires were showing thread's. I got in deep doodoo for that one but made it much worse when he decided to "teach me how to drive" and I decided to show him what I'd learned that day. He never swears but dropped the f-bomb at least a dozen times as we hit the cinder chicanes sideways at 65ish. My dad was so pissed then he stopped asking what the fawk is wrong with me and went quiet for a few minutes then out of nowhere tells me "DO IT AGAIN" but I was instantly confused and scared thinking he was testing me or something so I told him I didn't want to so we swapped seat's then he tried to get it sideways but ended up backwards in the bushes twice before he gave up lol. Commitment and confidence are important. Not as important as always keeping your word with honor though.  I live on the big island of Hawaii and have a 12 year old son and 6 year old daughter who I could never put second to my dreams. Their mothers turned out to be crappy wives and even worse mother's so they really really need me.  Maybe someday I'll figure out how to do both at once. Need to build a proper track here first of all. 🤙🏼
A five cylinder symphony!
Nice 👍👍👍👍
"They wouldn't let me do donuts" :(
Ingleshdaad...Inglewood...same same
The public which keeps Audi going, isn't allowed. Smh
I remember as a kid in England seeing Michelle Mouton's Quattro on display at a car showroom in my rainy little Yorkshire town. It was close to 50 years ago and it still seems clear as day. Magnificent machine. Then watching her win races until Audi's AWD system got tagged as an unfair advantage. Must have been something to walk into that building in Germany. Lucky guys.
That thought like who tf thought it would be fun to race this in rally at full speed.. I love you for that
WOW.................
Bring on the Audi Hoonicorn!
This is so much cooler than the Ford partnership!
Stig used to stay in my sister's hotel in Wales when he was testing his cars. I got a signed picture of him. He's a cool guy
Ken is Home.
You just can’t stop smiling while watching this video. The enthusiasm is awesome
this is the best partnership ever
Walter will refuse to do any promotion etc. with this "Just ain't care" Guy.
Audi not playin.  Awesome video! Those cars are amazing 👏
Hi Ken I'm am a eleven year old kid and I just got into high school and your videos always make my day better!
This is kinda wholesome idk why
this cars where waiting soooo long for ken! but they finally got fun together! 🔥💪
FYI we've just seen history
Absolutely loving this partnership.  We need to have a Timo FaceCam setup for Ken's next test ride. lol
Living life maxed out like his driving
это лучшее что я видел про ауди
it look like a koenigsegg
Stop crying and build one your a millionaire
“They wouldn’t let me do donuts”
My opinion of audi has been completely changed.   Holy shit those guys are cool
I feel like this is such a good partnership matchup because of the contrast between the two. Audi is this super refined, classy company with with respected racing heritage. And The Hoonigans,... well... *"kill all tires"* and *"just ain't care"*. Making warthogs and donks and shark karts and jumping cars over rivers 😆😆😆.
Dude....I have no words
Ken needs a 5 cylinder in his garage!
I was sad when the partnership with ford ended, but this is even better
Audi knows how to get a new customer.
only car he need to drive is the imsa at full power
Ford: don't Hoon our prototype Mach-E (which will become a full production car). Audi: let us pull out priceless 1 of 1 prototype out of the secret museum for you to drive.
1:47 *Kendy Shop Universe*, Tolles Joint Venture Ken Block und Audi - mit wirklichen Gänsehaut Momenten - da wird selbst Der _Jean Pierre Kraemo_ gestaunt haben, denn die Jungs waren auch noch bei ihm ;-)
I've never been a huge fan of the old, squared-off, rally body styles, but these museum tours are kinda changing my mind
I love how Ken and Scotto know more about the history of the cars than the tour guide.
Maybe new race car mfg in the future…..
This is so sick!!!🤘
I Never saw the RS002 driving fast till now. What a monster. It was built to kick Lanca Delta S4's ass. I never thougt to say that and it hurts. But it's good that FIA banned the Group B, befor that beast hit's the Stages.
Oh, we almost got a tear in 2:00! I'm happy and freaking out for this new stage on your career, Ken!
Audi's trying to make electric cars look fun by placing them near group b car hahaha what a joke....plus group b cars are too much for ken's average talent.
I'd let Timo talk more, since... y'know he works there and knows those cars inside out.
Speechless......... 😮
great series
Ken come out with a Audi rc car plz!!!
Living the dream bro!
ah! Americans lecturing on gb B rallying, bless em
Ken should buy a replica S1 and hoon it
Absolutely brilliant can’t wait to see what you guys got planned 🙏
Ken's like a kid in a candy store
Props to Audi!!! Hope more manufacturers follow suit!
If you guys have any ford branded stuff you need to get rid of I would be happy to take it off your hands lol. All jokes aside congrats on the new partnership can't wait to see what kind of crazy content will come from the new partnership with Audi
Ken said frightening like he was really scared of 300hp when he drives 1400hp like he stole it, Come on Ken, sac up!  Love the partnership with Audi, one of my favorite car brands.
I've always liked Audi. But after watching that 80's rally car ripping around like that. I really want an old Quattro
This series is amazing. So cool to see you live out a dream of yours and many others!
you are a lucky guy Ken you going to get Scotto some help get his Audi's running
Seek Jesus! Repent!! He’s the ONLY way!!!
Those old cars are "Thank God I'm finally getting driven!!!!!"
2:33 - So is that the first gen watercooled 1.6L that eventually became the VW engine in EVERYTHING until the ABF?
Dio santo! Questi video rispolverano la storia! Fantastici!
Uhrquattro Legende und kaum Klicks echt merkwürdig
Soo good to watch
You should build your own version of the s1 quattro, like the hoonicorn!
Finally
So lucky man lol
OMG u even scumbagged Audi HQ... have u no shame?
ples stop putting music on when the car is driving man
AHHHHHHHH I CANT WAIT FOR THIS AD TO BE OVER, IM NUTTING
I love how every classic collection features drip trays - modern gaskets are a feat of engineering!
Luckiest guy alive PERIOD 🔥🤟🔥
Never seen ken smile so big
10:51 I was just thinking this same thing!! That car sounds incredible
what do you give a guy who shares his dream with the world? A chance to drive the most iconic rally cars which just happens to be his dream. God bless Ken Block his family and his hoonagins
Audi. They make good cars. They've got problems with the oiling of the engine. Pressure and temperature mostly,
On gta 5 you can get a quartto for free it's called the omnius now that I watch this it shouldn't be free kind of disrespectful but than again it's a game
Can’t wait to see what u and Audi build fuck the hoonicorn Ford made a mistake by letting u leave but hey there always making bad decisions just look at there car and truck line up hahahah Ford Mustang what’s that a tampon
wow that sucks detuned i think they made like 500 back in the day when rallying
The way Ken do donuts on RS E-Tron GT (what ever u called it) its just insanely beautyfull.. 🔥🔥🔥 Oo GOD. PLEASE BLESS ME WITH ONE OF THOOSE SICK DRIVING PACKAGE!!!  Can't wait to see the HOONIGAN X AUDI X BLOCK finished cars!  And also not forgotten, can't wait for the next Ken GYMKHANA series on AUDI!!!
U living your life to the fullest
That’s funny u left Ford and will make more the. Ever before you know why ? Cuz Ford sucks
I jogged past the Audi factory in Ingolstadt once. On the side of it is a giant digital display which tells you what kind of Audi is just coming off the production line and which German state or country it will be delivered to.  I remember thinking that most people wouldn't care about it in the slightest but I really dug it.
Awesome job Ken Block! You have made it! Good luck with Audi. I will be following your new rides. New Hoons I mean.
Almost made me cry HHIC ,, stop it
Audi😍😍😍
Listening to Scotto nerd out is fun.
Oh wait this is kens first time at the Audi place
Ken is not lucky he deserves IT... LEGEND
The airfield location and they way it was filmed brings back original Gymkhana vibes so hard and for Ken to be to drive these legends is amazing.
Tune in next week when Ken Block creates a partnership with Lancia
i hope timo does not lose his job
i hope timo does not lose his job
Timo: I’ll be giving you guys a tour today Brian: hold my coffee
I love how Scotto just bullies ppl into doing things. shoves camera in face "we can go drive these now?"
I love how excited Ken gets when they talk about him driving the two. Like when you're 16 and you parents tell you to take the car out alone for the first time.
7 Lancia rally fans dislike this video lol
There should be tours for us vintage audi owners . "Ah you own a UrS , yes what day would you like to tour"  "Oh ..  You own a base model 2.8 b5 ... I'm sorry we are closed to the public"
I have been a Audi fan. Since I was very young teen. When I saw the group b rally cars. On ESPN reruns. And the quattro in IMSA. And when they built their Audi World Sports Car. Besides the group b. The Audi S-8 Is my dream car. And the Audi R-18 Turbo Diesel and E-Tron. I hope Ken will not only run in the WRC,AMR But also in IMSA for GTD. At the 24 hours of Daytona and the 12 hours of Sebring for Audi
Audi the best
8:24 The Audi guy got sweaty when he realized who he just agreed to take these priceless cars for a spin.
How could u dislike this video
respect to both parties!!
Hans Stuck!
Insane. Thanks.
legendary.
An American driving decent European machinery - the world is full of surprises...
Yee
A JP performance vid
dude got mildly roasted. fun times
IMSA GTO NEXT!
audi is the best
As an huge VAG and Rally fan (from America), I am so happy to see Ken partner up with Audi, can't wait to see what he will do.
a few weeks ago i saw the hoonigan boys in a jp performance video. they traveled to dortmund again
This video just puts a smile on my face. That's just it.
OMFG, so jelly right now! That prototype is so fucking sick!
Please please please can you get your hands on a Audi 90 IMSA GTO..... that would be the total ultimate!
its cool to see ken be like a little kid like wtf i am driving these pieces of rally history wtf
Fucking Amazing!! Holy Shit!
This is what we wanted since we knew about the new partnership
The grin on the HHIC face while driving the Group B Sport Quattro is priceless!!!
Timo is a king !!
If group B was some of the first supercars can we all say group S was the first hyper cars being more potent than group B and probably some modern supercars
“They wouldn’t let me do doughnuts. 😢”
Kinda Cool  Audi/Ken/Hoonigan
4ring4life
Ok I always thought Audi was like closed down and stuff but it’s now it’s clear there more of the crazy cousin that’s down for anything 😂
dude... I am speechless
"Is that something we can do?" Hahaha
Trc? Never heard of that
Hopefully Ken builds a restomod styled Audi but with modern Audi driveline parts beneath and modern safety gear.  That would be cool!  (Audi -- are you reading this by chance?!?!)
Archive this footage because this never happens.
Front windscreen angle on Sportquattro is because of reflections, not necessarily headspace.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Rad
I hope electric cars dissapear be because they harm us even more than gasoline cars also were are we going to put the batteries?
How can you not love the S1 Group B This car is just pure perfection
that E-Tron drifting out behind the Sport Quattro would make a killer commercial. the newest in Audi design sliding around what made their brand truly legendary to so many people.
Are those cars faster than current cars?
I'm really happy for Ken...🙌☺️🇩🇪🇺🇲
S1 E2 is a monster. If Ken's Helmet had more stars it would be reminiscent of Hans Stuck's helmet in IMSA
Seeing Ken that blown away is amazing!
In germany it isn‘t too unusual to take museum-grade cars out on track. Porsche also keep their fleet of historic race cars and classics in running condition, with regular visits to a track :)
Audi 200
The internets is so cool, it’s a dream to even watch this stuff
So fucking jealous RN!
The amount of love and respect Audi is showing Ken in this partnership is astounding. You can see a mutual passion.
Hopefully bringing Ken in means they are going to bring some excitement back into their exterior design. I want to like audi but nothing of their design excites me besides the R8
How  6 people disliked it?
Heaven.
Now THIS is more like it. They can stick their electric shit up their ause..........
This made me giggle like little kid :)
I believe that in 1000 years people will do top notch replicas of these old monsters and sort of daily drive them like it's a video game.
A little tear formed in the corner of Ken's eye as he walked into the garage.
The sound 💚💚💚
Holy crap, dude is living the dream even more !!  And that inline 5 noise !!!!
I had to subscribe due to you join the A team 😅🤣😂 good job Ken wish you the best in Quattro power
That 5 banger litrally couldn't sound any better!
Awesome video ken you are awesome and that audi sounds insane
Just soooo good!
I vow to never buy an Audi, because you fools are wearing masks in their museum. Shame on you all, communists.
7:32 Ken light up like a child on christmes morning omg its so beautiful to see ^^,
Ey Deutscher Depp... Du stehst an der frischen Luft und trägst Maulkorb?!?  Und in der Garage, im geschlossenen Raum, trägst du keine Maske ...PEINLICH!
Scotto is happy for Ken to be driving these, but also dying inside that he can't.
Love it, my heart was beating hard! I grew up watching really scca and arc. I'm envious!
Awesome to get to see a museum practically nobody gets to see!👍🏼👌🏽🥳🤟🏼
Big respect to audi !
If Audi thinks that a tie-in with Ken Block - and videos with classic Audi rally cars - is going to make me want to buy an Audi...they are 100% correct.
Man love to see the dude drive.  And that endless smile he has damn... Great videos love it 👌. Greetings from the Netherlands 🇱🇺🇱🇺
OOOH WE CERTAINLY NEED MORE OF THIS
0:59 What is he doing lol
I fckin love it. Period. !
happiness is contagious
The quattro with the mid engine was tested in Czechoslovakia near Slušovice... Behind the steel curtain ....
I cannot believe they let you do that how incredible!
Too many Ken nut swingerz in these videos.
Audi has an amazing sound love it 👌
How does it feel To drive such legendary cars?
Going to be very interesting what they come up with for Kens Audi ripper, definitely a clash of old with new!
A moment of silence.....    for Ken Block living THE FUCKING DREAM🔥🍻🤙🏎️
So so good ✊✊✊💦💦💦
Crazy how this old audi sounds almost just like a huracan, just wild engineering in that motor for its time!
Lost some respect for Audi today.  Wtf this building isn't open to the public!?  Selfish pricks.
Uhhh more pls 👏
You should team up with savage garage. They got a quatro replica. I think that would be a funn video
I might actually be more excited for the V8 DTM video......I have owned a V8 quattro that I chipped with the Abt software and put a 016 transmission in. Such a fun sleeper car with those two upgrades.
Great video. Why don't they let the tour host talk more though.
Those Audi legends omg!!! 😍😍😍 lucky SOBs. As for the end… look I get it the E-Trons are fast in a straight line and being an Audi are built amazingly well and def built way better than a Tesla but just hearing tires screaming and no engine is so lame. Give me more of that 5 cylinder scream!!! The future is gonna suck! Need 5 and 10 cylinders in our life! Please Audi keep those 2 engines!! I know Audi invented two of the best V8s ever with the 4.2 and 4.0 but something special with the 5 and 10. Maybe because so much more rare?? Anyway keep at least those 2!!
Amazing amazing amazing! I cannot wait to see what you are all been cooking up for the next Ken Block car for the gymkhana movie! all I gotta say is that I hope is not electric :)
so im guessing some new audis in line for ken coming down the pipeline
Awesome video! Great to see that car out and being driven and to hear the story how it influenced your career. It's funny to hear Walter Rohrl talk about what it was like to drive in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQyo9guYh1Q Looking forward to more Audi content!!!
It’s great that they take the cars out and drive them.  That is need to keep the parts from rotting.  Let the wild horses out to play with Ken.
13:14 - “ they wouldn’t let me do donuts”  the sadness that ken had in his voice was like a little boy getting turned down from riding in a fire truck.  I felt that.
I love the face Ken pulls when the reality that he is gonna drive two extreme Audi's... LOL!!!! The face of "WTF is happening, is this a dream!!!!"...  Such a dream.... CONGRATS!!!!!!
the group s cars would have been so cool
Does Timo still work there?
That Group B car is a wet dream! The sound of that 5 cylinder engine when it comes up on the pipe is phenomenal!
5cylinder sound is something else.
This is amazing!
So far I see A company who understands the meaning and importance of a good relationship in a partnership.  Tip my hat to audi.
We are still waiting for audio a2
"Let Timmo give us the tour"  Timmo says 10 words...
They say....cars are driven and not stored.😁   Damn! Ken ripped it!💪🏽  I'm sure the German guys heart is pounding hard while he watch those museum cars ripped the pavement!😆
Glad to see Audi respects the passion rally drivers have and actually be on same pages rather than act like a employer and boss.
Er ist einfach in Deutschland
Glad to see Audi with the first electric car that can hoon
Now this is nice. So much better than the e-tron XD.
Here in Germany you can buy streetlegal replicas of the S1E2 and if you have the money you can feel like Walter Röhrl on a rally stage
Scotty is not the only one jealous bet most of the fan base has just passed out seeing those drive out again.
Love the sound!
The sound of that 5 cylinder tho
Congrats Ken on living out the dream. Loving these videos and can't wait to see the new Block Audi gear for sale.
This is the ultimate level of scumbaggery
Watching ken ask to drive those cars is like watching a kid ask for his favorite toy.
This is just insane🤯the sounds , damn what an era.
I'm so stoked for Ken to be with Audi. I've never seen him or Scotto this giddy.
I'm not sure who is more stoked about this partnership with Audi, Ken Block, the man behind the wheel, or Brian Scotto, the man behind the Hoonigan.  Regardless, I can't wait to see what the future holds for this awesome combination of car manufacturer and driver. So far, so good!
Have you guys seen what AUDI did to the german tuner JP Performance? They wenn to pikes Peak and some other spots.
That 5-cyl sound omg
Ken is going to be the next transporter lol
Ken, you are living the dream man! Love it!
Willkommen bei uns Autoverrückten!  Although i like FORD as equally as AUDI!  Anyway nice to see this cooperation 🇺🇸🇩🇪🤙🏼!
This is so allsome Audi let Ken Block take a museum rally car out for a text run I got to give a big Thank You to Audi for doing this Ken looked like a little kid in a candy store ones again thank you to Audi for making a dream come true for Ken Block this video is amazing.
Ken they detuned the car as a test, secretary they where timing you. What's Ken's Audi emblem going to look like? 4 skull rings? 💀💀💀💀
We want some onboard/helmet cam!!
yall really scumbagged a company.  damn.
When I die I hope I go to that place because it is heaven
The last drift
The Polar Express music got me 🤣
Serious honor to be allowed to drive a piece of history from the top secret Audi clubhouse
how much you want for the priceless legend audi??
Scum bag goals
all i can say is, HOLY SHIT.
Scum bagging on a hole new level
9:35  What he said... 🤟
I got a question how much longer can Ken block do this career choice. I really do hope it works out with Audi and Ken. and here's the thing he's got to win races for them.
I was sad when ken broke up from ford. but audi?.  damn thats even more sick.
Best sounds ever created  Electrikana go be 🔥
No words. OOOO Wonderland.
sad we didn’t get to see the engine bay of the group b car…
I love classic rally Audi's but come on, those Le Mans prototypes are just sitting there and you're not even gona show us one?  🙁
Thank you very much timo for letting ken rip!
3:03 why did u put S1 E2 sound from Finland here? 🤔
Are you actually kidding me?! This is unbelievable. The original group B quattro... man, you guys are soo lucky! Big probs to Audi, that's such a cool move.
I cant believe there's another video coming with more cars... Wild.
Ken made some of Pastrana Gymkhana's "This car scares me to death" face
So exciting to see these monsters in action.. what an exciting and brilliant partnership
This is the best video today thank you for making my day I can’t wait for the next one a legendary driver with a  legendary Audi heritage
Dare I say it seems like Audi wants Ken to experience their catalog of racing lineage to help him understand the traditions of the brand?
Наконец-то снова появились видео, которые можно бесконечно смотреть снова и снова!!))
cant wait for the next MONSTER car they make with AUDI
yall are my favorite people on earth   i llove yall so much i like idolize you ken so amazing!!!!!
Wonder if they’ll let you drive the Le Mans Quattro
I love the B class rally cars so iconic and bad ass
So if not these, what will Ken be tearing up the gravel with??
I'm a Audi geek I'm having the greatest 41st birthday today cheers guys 🔥🔥😁 i
you guys were totally scumbagging timo. lmao
This. Is. *INSANE.*
Ken's first Audi helmet, will go in there...
This feels like an American bull was let loose in an Audi china shop and I like it. On behalf of most Europeans, I welcome you.
It's first time for me to see ken block actually chicken to drive the car
You could tell that Ken was in heaven when he walked in and saw all the rally cars
I could listen to that S1 getting ripped about all day long.
Ken literally gets the damn KEYS to Audi
I am suprised ken hasn’t bought a Quattro yet. Like the homologated ones
Man that is crazy that they let you drive and it was a awesome as hell. Great video
As a nobody, in Maui, thousands of miles away that got to see this happen on my IPhone,  even I am super grateful that I got to see this happen. Thank you Timmo and Audi Tradition people! :)
I am all for this partnership because ken just looks so happy
Hear all the need/history stuff from Scotto is really cool.
Sad to see those few audis that has Mikkola writen in it. Rip Hannu Mikkola, true audi driver
Man I'm not even jealous that I'll never get to drive these cars because at least I saw Ken Block do it! I would love to drive the prototype Le Mans cars though.
The real question is if they will let you drive the R8, R10, R15 and/or R18?
Do not call him Ken Block anymore, but Marty McFly because he is back to the past and even to a past which didn't happen. Well done sir ! Next step : the Quattro S1 restomod ?
The scumbaggery is so beautiful
Those cars are priceless and then this fucker comes in and fucks them up
I’m blistering with excitement I’m on the edge of crying!
mind blown with those last two videos!!!
its the noise of the S1 E2 ..... its just fantastic.
Welcome to europe Ken👍. Great Audi trip race💪.
You just full filled every 80s kids dream!!!!!!!!!! WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Compliance masks ruin everything
I'm pretty much against this partnership, ken doesn't fit with audi, audi is prestige and ken just breaks cars
Scotto is to Audi what Nads is to Honda🤣🥴
I wanna know who the 4 ppl the thumbs down this video are and what they drive!! lol
You are driving the car that legend Hannu Mikkola used to  drive and keep in mind he was faster than you will newer be by miles!
there are going to be a lot of nice video's coming out of this relationship. I'm happy.
The look on Kens Face for at least 30 seconds was priceless
I can't even put the amount of jealousy that I have into words right now.
*_YESS!_*
And finally you picked the wrong car, the S1 should be spinning donuts around the fridge.  great video👍
The legendary quattro that only Delta can beat them... So fun and loud :D
Bulid customs Audi please :)
Ken looked like a kid in a candy shop
That engine note....
In germany we say, kranke scheiße
Oh NO.. ken didnt get his carcaine vaccine before going to drive all these.. his storage space just got too small
Ken, I think I saw a tear.
I ALWAYS NEEDED AN AUDI GROUP S IN MOVEMENT!
Damn that’s like an extra 400kg of weight in that car now because of all those dudes
I don't think I've seen Ken so excited in his life haha! That's awesome!!!!!
Speechless!  😮  So cool ! 🤙🏻
GOD tier scumbagging fellas, outstanding.
jeeeez that white car sounds angry as fuckkk love it
I’m a proud owner of a 1995 Audi RS2 in red with 105422 miles and it’s mint trust me 👌👌👌
Lucky S.O.B. for Audi to say yeah you can take cars from our hidden non public museum and give them a good hooning. That's so amazing man. This is a dream partnership. You can raise their profile and they can provide you with the machinery. Can't wait to see what's next
Rally is the best Motorsport
Wow. Tha was soo cool😍
The fact that even Ken f*cking Block is afraid to drive the Group S car on a gravel stage really speaks to how absolutely insane it is
Wow, that's very cool 😊🏎💨💨💨💨🏎 It's crazy in a good way in how #53 Herbie "Volkswagen" owns the most popular car manufactures in the world such as Lamborghini,Audi,Bugatti,Porsche and Bentley.
Turbo go brrrrrrrrrrrrr
Mantap Pak Abu ❗👊🏻
Ken, you coming to see WRC rally in Finland? Could be nice!
Amazing cant wait for an Audi Hoonigan film
😱🤯🔥 Ken + Audi
Please tell me you are going to do an S1 build similar to the Cossie? S1 but if it was built today would be the next level !
Awesome 👏🏻 anyone that thumbs down this is a complete loser!!
W O W
S1 E2 and Ken ❤️❤️❤️
Finally they checked with the other boss
My VAG endorphins are out of control right now! I like how Scotto straight up Nadded out and did the whole museum piece on his own with Timo in the background.
Group b Audi 5 cylinder sound = nonstop goosebumps
Was* secret
7:10 this is fucking hilarious🤣🤣
Audi v10 split in half but its on steroids
Ken Block,you lucky SOB 🤙🏻, that's epic 🤯
I don't think there's another person on the planet Audi would let do AWD donuts around their priceless museum pieces.  They trust the HHIC himself.
Group S prototype car looks like the love child of Audi and Porsche.
Audi seems very chill and awesome. Super excited for this partnership and to see where it leads. Hooned quattro coming???....
this is the definition of boyhood dream
Ауди легенда
That is so awesome! I can’t wait for the next video guys, that’s really cool of Audi to do.
Hey Audi, can we PLEASE get the Group S prototype car in Forza Horizon?
Ken getting to drive these cars is just epic.
LEGEDRAY CAR NEEDS LEGEDRAY DRIVER💥💪🏻
Most Audi cars aren't savage, they're Genghis Khan Savage
Good job!.
I coomed...  (I regret NOTHING)
As a Ford worker. This makes me feel sick. You Traitor!!!!  As a car lover this is siiiickkk
Watching how happy you two are is making me so freaking happy. I love everything about this!
i wanna have one of both!
Where did the mustang end up at
🌭
At least Audi realize that these cars are meant to be driven
This video is exactly what We needed in our lives! Love this new partnership!
EARGASM
Never happy are u Ken , just be happy u got to have a go
Ken is probably one of the only people to ever drive an rs200 and an rs002
If anyone should drive those cars it should be you ken.
Dream cars.... god damn it!
Best partnership ever, I would think
this will 100% be one of the best videos on the channel
You know, you’ve been posting so much awesomeness that I’m running out of stuff to say! “Rally” happy for you and all the Hoons.
They should give Ken an ALM drift Audi
6:50 Ken: Asks to drive priceless cars Audi Tradition employee: "If we all agree that we get a little more smooth and gentle to stuff, that might work" Hoonigans: *nervous silence*
I've never been more proud to be a fan. Congratulations!!!
wow! Good collections!!😂
Ken Block "Back to the future" 🤣🤣🤣👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Легендарная квадратура! Габариты с современным экземпляром поражают.
The level of excitement I have watching this is a little bit absurd.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This partnership is really really great!
its Germany...I mean what do you expect with the secret "Batcave😂"
being able to drive an S1 E2 Quattro must be a feeling that nothing can be able to reach, its a dream for us, and a reality for Ken.
Ken block and audi 🔥🔥🔥🥵make a good couple
That Audi Quattro is my favorite rally car ever
Gonna be a good sponsorship based on the past two vids
Ken almost cryed when they entered the garage
Holy Grail 😯😲😯 Paradise Garage 😍
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
I love those old Quattro s1’s, if only I could afford one
just l finished watching the first one where this left off and this popped up epic
Okej Very nice car
Just On Fire 🔥  As always 😍😍
God 🔥🔥🔥
All i every wanted was to see Ken throw that audi sideways.  Dream fulfilled!
You are the best
Love your vids
Nice i've beem waiting for this episode.. Sakto! 😊
Nice car ✔️
