you should send some suga merch to Australia 🇦🇺 🙈☺️✨
I love how he gets Jake and what he's doing ....
Triller put on a terrible show, fuck you mean..... Typically when I pay for a fight, I wanna see a fight, not terrible musical performances..... just sayin'.
U need a title shot bro
O'malley you got the curse son. Hope it was worth it. You gonna end up like ryan.
Jake Paul vs Sean O'malley!!
IM A FAN OF YOU BRO !!!!! CANT WAIT FOR YOUR NEXT FIGHT!
Gotta read the patterns . Every top fighter that's hung with lil jake get the lil jake disney curse and start losing fights. Adesayna, perry,masvidal, ryan just broke down and retired. You seeing the pattern smokey.
Nice video keep it up make more related videos
Well your one of the only fighters I know who thinks it was an amazing event.
Now call him daddy 🤦🏻‍♂️
Ite bro but you waste yr skill cos you aint champ, askren just didn't care, let go of this premadonna shit cos i was ravin on yer comeup but uve gone influencer vibes
is "boxing"...."boxing".....if its just a punch?    jake didnt "box" he threw a punch.... i could do that, u keep saying good "boxing"  he threw 1 punch!
u fight him!
*KSI gonna end Jake foshizzle myhizzle*
Crimefaces can't think up rhymes on the spot is the third thing I took away from the fight
Give Sean O’Malley a big payday
Mate Diaz or Tyrone Woodley would mess Jake up pretty good unless they didn't go super hard and somewhat took it easy on him. But Jake talking about possibly stepping in an mma ring would be a terrible idea, even though I don't like him I wouldn't wanna see him get mauled terribly..
Why ain't nobody talking about how ben got right up after being knocked down once and then they called the fight even though he was visibly still capable of fighting???? Shit was rigged as fuck if you ask me
Liked the event but Pete Davidson or whatever his name was needs to be barred from commentating. Bashing a guys looks and the fight is completely disrespectful. At the end of they day they're both fighters and you get guys like Pete who's probably never set foot in a gym trash talking other fighters.
He is calling out everyone.... Except actual Boxers.
Saying it was an "amazing event" is more delusional then claiming your undefeated
I love how his infant child hitting the heavy bag in the background.
Something happened before the fight. Paydays. Money was bet askren didn't wanna be there. Oil for a fixen
How could anyone ever think Ben Askren, a wrestler could BOX... Dude sucked @ striking in MMA, how the fuck is he gonna box anyone when you can't even strike? Jake sucks too though, it's a cash grab so he's obviously gonna pick a wrestler who's never boxed. Any decent amateur boxer would knock Jake the fuck out.
Confident young man speaking his mind without bias and jealousy. Shout out to Suga!!!
Bro while I respect you and you're opinions Jake isn't a star he's just attached himself to Disney early so kids followed him its called children are the only reason he's even considered popular fucking done with u now lost all respect
Ben Asprin
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
You need glasses, jake didn't look like a pro boxer at all, or you were drunk
This guy does drugs, why would anyone ever think he could be a viable champion lol.
LOVE TO HATE HIM. THATS WHAT IT IS !!!
Nate Diaz doesn’t know what pain is....
True words, positive guy. No hating I like your point of view 💪🏼
KSI vs Jake Paul would break the internet. IF this Ben Askren vs JP made it to the top 10 PPV fights ever. Imagine JJ vs jp.
The fact that snoop dog was a commentator I lost respect for the fight.
Dude was hyping up Ben, hung out with Logan and switched up so fucking fast, Sean you are no longer valid.
I feel like Ben was the only fighter that got knocked down and WASN'T allowed to keep fighting.
realist shit u said
damn sean i love you as ufc fighter but giving respect to someone like jake paul as  "fighter" at this point was really cool too see from u ... cant wait for ur next performance !!! huge respect
O'Malley vs Jake now plz
Nice
https://youtu.be/cyBccASEniY
Another take away - Oscar Dela Hoya was the absolute BIGGEST TOOLBAG on a mic in the ENTIRE HISTORY of combat sports.
Damn dude lol  I respect Sean for this honesty  I didn’t expect this
Saw O'malley's video before fight and thought Ben would grappling and punishment the body too but I was angry about Ben just put his head to be "knocked". I wasn't there but I can't imagine see him running and smiling haha. Keep doing your best for you and your family dude
Jake Paul can box 5’9 non-boxers... put his ass in their with an actual boxer that’s a super middleweight to cruiser weight.
It's good that you have come to your normal skin unlike any other tomato skinned MMA guy..
Curious.  Who you playing chess against?
Dude nobody cares about your thoughts on anything you cannot even admit to losing
Yo I swear most of us knew what the results were gonna be lol
1:27.  Mood when I’m playing CoD
1 thing I could say at At least he’s not going to Mexico for wins
glad the event was good for the few people there, 1.5 million people had to go through hours of Del La Hoya on party powder and shitty camera angles
you look like a ghetto andrew garfield
Most real post fight recap and explanation how the boxing game really is.
https://youtu.be/uEdwcuPRyRw
I used to have respect for sean
Hit the thumbs up if you want to see Jake Paul vs O’Malley!
Usually those “bums” are at least other aspiring boxers. The next one should be an up and coming boxer or striker with a fan base behind them.
Luv u dude...
Love ur hair
Sean knock him the fuck out that's all we need fuck the money boy
Ben needs a asprin lmao
Wayyda not hate bro 🤙!  I can't stand   hearing but hurt fanboys.   Now that a few big dogs have said it.. The bar stool fanboys will follow.  And I subscribed aha
You should fight Jake Paul and shut him up :)
"They'll go 20-0 beating up bums" big facts! I've been trying to tell people this.
Event was dogshit😂
BROOOOOO >> I TOUGHT U WILL BE THE FIRST WHO SAIS HOW FIXED IT WAS ...
Sean- triller threw a great event, there were girls twerking. I thought it was a boxing exhibition lol
He spoke facts, that’s why I fuck with O’Malley heavy. I think the reason people can’t admit Jake became a decent boxer is because of all the lies/opinions he has in the fight community, like he just called out canelo??. If he spoke the way O’Malley did he would be much more respected but it wouldn’t sell the fights to the level he did so I kinda understand both sides. Jake sells fights and wont be boxing a boxer for a while until he gets better than decent.
Spittin facts
Just found ya! Bout time. These fights are sad. Mine as well fight paraplegics. And Ben shoulda learn to block at least. There’s no way jake would do mma. If I was Ben I would attack his ego and challenge to another match but mma
Suga KO’s jake in 1 round
It was rigged
If you believe this was an actual contest, never reproduce👌
U ain't from AZ  bud
Spoke to early,  this guy is shot out and jake probably would fuk dis dude up
Yo sean O'Malley plz can u beat up joke paul
Go on impaulsive bro
DEGEN
Sean better watch out before Jake starts using his name to get more clout
That event was trash for the budget they had if I was jake I would be happy but I would also want a better production on the circus and just the overall angles of the fights
the event was horrible tho xD
0:54 I’m not an expert but I don’t think real boxers call out the best of the best then fight the worst of the best 💀 thats where people dislike him. He talks and talks but doesn’t really prove nothing because he finds loop holes such as Ben askren.
A good event doesn’t get names wrong, also heard it was pretty shit tbh
Amazing event? It was pathetic!
Nick Diaz
Here is a thought. Ben is more of a man😂😂 throws a fight not one excuse made. 🤷‍♂️😂😂 for the slow. Admits defeat like an actual grown male not a tween female 😂😂😂😂
is he paying you
you lost fans
If Dana thinks they can beat Jake I think he’d let it happen.
bambi
“Amazing event” LOL. That was a disaster from start to finish.
Ikr. People out here expecting him to go fight Canelo or some undefeated pro boxer lmfao. Pro boxers fight bum until they're like 8-0 or 10-0 before they get to fight actual undefeated pro boxers. That's how it has always been. The dude is only 3-0. Let him fight a couple more bums before he gets an actual killer. Heck his even already calling out conor who was able to go 11 rounds with Floyd and had the upper hand for the majority of the fight before he gassed out. Conor is definitely above some good boxers in striking ability and Jake is already calling him out so he isn't afraid to fight a killer striker. It's just that he has to fight someone that will bring in ppv buys and someone that will draw attention. Many boxers don't have that type of clout. Only high ranking boxers like Canelo etc can do that but jake is only 3-0. He shouldn't skip straight to the big dogs. He has to have a couple more fights against bums before getting actual good fighters. Many pro boxers have gone through the same thing.
I’ve always liked this dude but he really needs to quit marketing Kratom. Nothing but a legal opioid. F*#k around an get hooked and you’ll know exactly what I’m talkin about. Full blown, all out opiate withdrawal. I was lucky to make it out and I’m lucky to have 5 yrs clean. Y’all be careful with this sketchy s*#t... If you understand what I’m talking about please help spread the word. This shit should be illegal nationwide
And  were excited to watch yours.😜😏.. O my God your daughter so cute.💯❤🇨🇦🍻
Oscar out of his mind on that booger sugar calling everyone baby lmao.  The Black Keys and Mt Westmore was the highlight of my night.
at 1:35 it sounds like there is a forced birth being given
Nothing wrong with what Jake does..smart..
Thats kinda how u pick your opponents..highlight reel
It was fake tho
The one punch that Askren landed and Jake took off running almost turned his back to Ben if I remember right... Paul needs to fight an actual boxer.. One that’s trained how to punch.
That Triller event was 100% trash .. Sorry but not sorry .. People paid for a fight card and got a concert
Jake doesn't need to fight someone crazy good, he just needs to fight someone who actually knows how to box with their hands up for fucks sake, he's fighting some random's he gets off the internet
I read the title as Ben aspirin
Ben Asprin.
I get what he is saying, and yeah make money make money but watching Sean partying with the youtube kid and supporting that snobby kind of people bums me out :(
It was a good win for Ben! Nice amount of $$!
I can see matching the colors of your shirt with your shoes, but perfectly matching your chest tattoos with your hair is a whole different level  :)
I luv 2 watch him fight! Potential is insane! But I lost my ability to concentrate on much that he said after opening up with Triller put on an AMAZING SHOW!! 🤔😯 Followed by Jake Paul CAN BOX!! 🤔 Based off of this?? He doesn't look like a 3-0 boxer, bc he has never fought an opponent who was also a boxer! Lol 1st 3 fights, every opponent was fighting their 1st EVER BOXING MATCH! Those 3 were not boxers who have been training, and coming up through the amateur ranks, trying to make a boxing career of it, and the 1st 2, had never trained for any type of combat sports event! Hilarious, that you can compete with a guy who just walked off the street, and box him, and it be officially in the books as a professional match, and victory! It's a insult to the boxers who have worked their way up, come through the amateur ranks, and box 3 guys in their 1st 3 matches who also have been on this quest and training for yrs to make it in this sport.. It is what they do! Boston Celtics fan, always love Nate Robinson, but how is that not considered a celebrity boxing match, but a official professional boxing match! So I disagree, that anything from a guy who has been training, has the means to bring good top ppl in to assist in training for a lil over 3yrs.. That by him defeating 3 ppl, who ABSOLUTELY ARE NOT BOXERS! Not bc they just weren't any good.. But the fact that they REALLY aren't boxers, and only time they put repetition in it was preparing for their 1 match.. They haven't since! Lol Don't try to compare his 3-0 record to that of most pro boxers, and the so called tomato cans they box early.. They are all boxing other boxers, who have trained and trying to make a career out of being a pro boxer.. They did NOT come from the amateur ranks and in their 20-0 start, although they beat many guys who were not top tier boxers, they NEVER boxed a guy coming off of his 1st time of doing any and everything with boxing for the 1st time! Lol His experience being his 1 training camp!!!! 😂😂 What a joke! If he is such a superstar,  and name doesn't matter, then box other guys who are early in professional career, since YOU ARE A "PROFESSIONAL," boxer!!! Saying he can box, and him being a professional level newcomer is 2 VERY different things! They are an endless amount of amateur boxers that would destroy him 1 after another! So what do you mean exactly, when you say he can box? Ohh that he has trained for over 3yrs and he can beat ppl who has NEVER boxed!! Okay.. Although it sounds as if that should be the outcome.. 😂😂
i fuckin love you dude 🤣🤣
1:27 wtf was that, I though someone was being murdered outside of my house
That Triller event was a JOKE... Worst fighting event I’ve ever seen in my life.
This was the realest take ive heard, bro you need to fight Aldo if you cant get yan itll get you a top 4 after
I (along with EVERY SINGLE fight fan that's following Jake) Wana see him fight a REAL striker. Not a god dam wrestler, not a stupid weak ass basketball player. A STRIKER. I just don't think he has the commitment or the focus to be able to get a win over a real striker. I really don't.  His hands are obviously nice and crisp so he needs to get out there and show that he's LEGIT before he gets any more respect from the boxing/fighting community.
Haha funny joke on the title
Jake is a terrible person in more ways than one.
At 2:57 you can tell he wanted to say "That's what happens when your mouth writes a check you can't cash" but he couldn't so he just changed the subject.
Glad I didn't waste money on that "fight". Getcho money Jake, but it won't be mine lol.
dude its so cool to hear you say this. this is exactly how i feel about jake. But i'm a total casual when it comes to fighting, admittedly. I just like the story behind Jake, it's really interesting to see how far he can go
what did he said here 4:25  ?
ben needs an aspirin 😂😂😂😂
He should fight someone that will kill him that’s a super fight then stop fighting lol nobody is going to keep watching him
i get that you're trying to be level headed but this dude is a clown end of story.
Your boy is a bum

One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates⭕️
Ben Askren's only mindset was to troll convincingly. He was a champ in a different class that day.
Ben really tried but realistically jake was in a different weight class and he needed the win. After the cool down fuck jake Paul but good win.
yeah but if stipe can last until the second round with Francis why couldn't ben put up more of a fight ?
Great talk!
I can't believe how stupid society has become.
For the most part boxers fight bums who are atleast considered boxers. A boxer is someone who trains in boxing to better themselves, so put someone in the ring with the same amount of talent as an amature boxer who wants to really be there.
Lmao 🤡
Jake against Tommy Fury would be a good show
Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2  Jesus loves you! ♥️
Triller was garbage
Sean prolly the only one take can ACTUALLY make Reverse watermelon hair look dope af
Dude this guy knows where it’s at. Elite fighter. Elite personality and he understands he needs to be posting videos like this and opening. Up and gaining new fans/geting closer to his fans. Gained a new fan in me through these videos for sure
Scripted as fuck
Good to see a legit ufc fighter be happy for the lane of other fights to just bring more money and opportunities for fighters in general, thanks for the nuanced opinion suger
😆😆😆😆 let's get this clear THIS WAS NOT A SUPERFIGHT, that was not a huge win he had all the advantages you can possibly have. Dana White just lost  A LOT of money and he doesn't like Jake so I definitely wouldn't be surprised if he allowed somebody like Diaz to fight Paul
Sean u should take him. Show him what a real striker would do to him🚑🚑🚑
I’m embarrassed that Jake Paul brought me here. But I’m subscribed now.
Love your personality so much my man, great ass fighter too! 💪💪💪 Please restock the suga show logo hoodie, want one badly 👌
Imagine the trash talk if jake and conner fought lol
He looks like a guy who's had a few white collar boxing fights, maybe amateur level, maybe we'd have to see him fight a decent quality professional!
Nothin fun about a rigged fight
Dick ridin on a shitty rigged fight, all for a payday....sad
You a 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
That fight was rigged.
How can anyone consider him being 3-0 as a boxer when he has not even fought a boxer. First was another scrub YouTuber then a basketball player who was retired that can't fight. Third was Ben who is a wrestler, and his mindset was take a punch and go down as a millionaire. If Jake is such a good boxer put him in the ring with any real boxer who is in his age range, and then we'll see how good Jake really is.
Ben looked so confident in the press conference
Nate diaz would straight peace him up xD
Does it really count as a 3-0 professional record if you're not fighting professionals? 3 people who have never boxed before, let alone had a professional boxing match doesn't really count for anything does it? Unknown unnamed actual trained amateur boxers would be far more impressive.
Sean can lick Jakes's boots all he wants or pretty sure be one of his cheerleaders IDC, But the fact is people love Ben more than ever is the greatest thing. People talk about Ben more than anyone now after he even lost.
Get off his nuts! smh,  Jake is a. Bum he isn't even boxing amateur  boxers. So come back to reality.
Ben askren fought nobodies his whole career. I could fight Ben askren and Jake Paul in my driveway at the same time, a with a cigarette in my mouth. Ben was never really that great to begin with. He rolled off the couch for an easy million. Hes a smart business man
Ok
Was 100 percent planned/faked. Ben did NOT get knocked out like that by one punch. Coming from the man you takes lunches 10x harder than that and with sparing gloves on. Sooo fake.
you know what been doesnt do take his wife on every podcast like you do your boyfriend,doesnt make excuses for being beat,doesnt lay on the ground waiting for a stretcher.Bens fighting days might be over but yours never began.You have yet to fight anyone thats worth remembering.And when you had a chance to be in a real fight you took the bitch way out..This new wave of tough nerds is funny as fuck
When you speak like this your actually very articulate, Intelligent, insightful and likeable. Stick to just being yourself like this rather than all the hype talk and stupid walk offs.
Triller did NOT throw an amazing event lol
Totally agree with you, i justy subscribed btw
When are we getting some Sean/Kyler sparing tapes?
Dude, wtf is up with you? You look little a my little pony!
Like some said,,, i respect on how real you're,, dammnn,, "yea me too"
I just smoked some stank breath and I legit thought his baby was someone in my house for a sec..
You're not like them bro, you're smarter and in control. They have no control of their life.
I love how real you are!
Dude you look like a clown.
I pretty much have the same thoughts. looking forward to seeing you in the ring Sean
Okay - so now I know what a drug addled sociopath looks and acts like.  Thanks!  I'll keep my distance.
Whos getting beat up in the background
please dont call it a fight. This was clearly a payday for them both. Clearly a dive. Clearly. What you dong Sugar?
Ur trending sean👍
Ben’s careeer is to know make other people famous
"Ben looked like a 0 and 0 boxer"real 😂
The only reason Sean is defending jake is because he got tickets to the fight 😂 a real fighter should see how Ben took a dive.
It was masochism to be exact.
I did not tune into this fight so idk what you were talking about I was too busy watching UFC! I mean you’re right on how he should start his career but he is calling out top contenders in MMA not actual boxers who actually do it in the ring not the CAGE it’s a whole different sport and even you know that!
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
What’s stopping Jake from going 51-0 fighting bums 😭
When we gona see JP vs 69
Imagine winning a fight against a pro fighter when the whole world is rooting for you to get knocked out and no one is taking you seriously as a boxer. That’s gotta feel great.
U look like on the verge if tears... 😭
I don't normally like Omalley, but I agree with him on this. He seems a little more humble also.
Dont boxers typically fight other boxers?
Much love sean🙏
Great points, liked the chill delivery.
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
I loved Pete making fun of this shit
Finally someone with brain who isn't biased.
I didn’t tune in. Jake Paul is a douche bag. Ben Askren is a wrestler. So who cares.
Agreed that most pro boxers go 20-0 beating “bums” as you say but those bums are still attempting to become or are professional boxers most have been boxing since they were children’s and probably most boxing bums would slaughter jake jake has beaten one guy with combat experience in his career in askren the rest had no fighting experience he wants to fight Tommy fury I say let them do it this would be a great fight and pretty even. Tommy’s only beaten non established pro boxers believe he’s 8 or 9-0 and jake has beaten his 3 opponents there both about the same size and jake and Tommy both wanna do it allegedly so make it happen and if he beats Tommy I’ll give him respect but if he ducks and fights another retired or guy with no experience then he ain’t getting none of my respect as he’s just picking easy fights that he knows he’ll win!
Hey why don’t you box Jake?! Seriously it’s so funny to hear this from you. Ben made bank. You a dummy. Why doesn’t Jake box a real boxer? Why is he boxing the worst striker in the ufc and who is retired. Seriously how stupid are people these days.
Suga Sean is number 33 on trending. What a guy.
I heard facts.
Your personality doesn’t suit your hair
The whole event was a joke
This is not a "good win". Nobody is legitimately asking Jake to fight a top boxer, we're just asking for him to fight an actual boxer. You know, since he claims he's a legitimate pro boxer and taking the sport seriously and also claims he's an "elite prospect" and hasn't even fought anyone that competes in the sport he claims he's a prospect in.
Yoel Romero!!
He just dissed Jake in the most discrete way. It is what it is, keep boxing non-boxers for the most money.
before the fight it was “bens a real fighter he’s gonna ko jake”  now it’s “he was a wrestler he never had any boxing skills” hahahaha
If you are reading this comment:💕💕💕💞BE BLESSED!!!   x   1,000,000 !!!!💞💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Your dad lost
We can’t lie, He flopped so quick and switched to Jake’s side soon as he won😂 but I HOPE Jake fights Tyron woodly and wins!
I think you should just be a little more honest. Call a spade, a spade. Jake Paul is a boxer. Yes. Is he a high level boxer? That question is absolutely UNKNOWN, until you fight BOXERS. I think you nailed it on the head though, take the worst guy with the biggest payday because in my opinion, he’s not a high level boxer yet. I’ll choose legacy over money any day. “Wants to be the best?”   Then beat the best.
Biggest pay day and look for another terrible boxer lmaooo😂😂😂
Ban got paid $1000000 to lose
Why is nobody checking up on Dana White? Didn't he bet $1,000,000 on the fight?
Tommy fury
It was the worst event in Combat history
Andrew Garfield, is that you?
Spot on dude. Ben's might be a good guy but he was in pathetic condition. And terrible attitude towards the whole fight... he was sleeping on the table. Jake was right Ben just wanted to take a dump the whole time. And Jake dumped him.
We just want him to fight A BOXER. Doesn't have to be the best boxer in the world. Just literally anyone that boxed before.
love my sugar thumbs up before the show even begins
GO JAKE PAUL!
Sugaaaaaaaaaah bro you go please beat that clown. bro I know you can beat him. Go sugaaaaaaaaaah pawaah!!
Ben was fucking abysmal
gotta admit -- Jake Paul is the best meme boxer right now. just keep at it. fuck taking a real fighter, just get fat bags and have fun
Serious suga show is appreciated big brain talk is always fun
All you need is a big red nose!
Take Woodley
I understand you don't go up against the best boxers but for christ sake fight a dude who can legit box. Fight an ameture or golden gloves guy or soemthing.
O’Malley fuckin cooked. Probably flambé’d too
Fight was set up
👀Pupils bigger then Ben Askren’s gut 😂you really are running on 2 hours of sleep lmaoo
Only reason why I root for Jake Paul is to see the whole internet and especially my friends lose their shit 🤣. I basically robbed my friends all 3 times Jake fought.
I saw a video earlier of Ben losing a wrestling match 0-11 and come out smiling more than the guy that won 🤣
Want to see O’Malley’s career continue to get bigger as well 💯🙌🏻
https://youtu.be/-7hXL2p-W-M
Hey Sean hope all is well, Dude would you ever fight Jake Paul??
Sean would sit jake down. That’s too easy.
Good take Sean
Amazing event? It was a horrible production
O'Malley has bigger aspirations of being a C-List celebrity than UFC champ.
Can someone claim to be an professional boxer and never box professional boxers?  He'll no. Jake is a side show. Boxing circus. He will never be legit or valid.
It was rigged lol jake can’t box for shit when he fights an actual pro boxer in the ring it’s lights out and reality gonna him
nice
When the baby started talking it scared the shit outta me. Thought something crazy was behind me lol
"amazing event" lol lemme close this video right there
Everybody knew watch jakes. Overhead. . So what the hell. The first hit spin back in the first second round. Bull how stupid was Ben . He knows how to spin back
conner mcgregor would be a hit
why am i watching this lmao
Jake Paul might be a legitimate contender real soon.
Please Nate take the fight. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I don’t think Ben cared bro just wanted that bag and he secured it fosho, would love to see Jake against a real boxer though kids not bad but we wanna see some real competition
Ben didn't care or train as you said homie!!! Jake is NOT a positive influence in society...I follow people like YOU or NATE not Jake the joke Paul smh
NOPE I WATCHED WHITAKER FIGHT BRO!!!! I am NOT paying to watch JAKE PAUL fight bums smh
Woodley wants in on the action
Ben went through the motions and left w a check.
thoughts longer than the fight
I think Dana White wants Jakes ass kicked so he will let a good boxer fight him .
Sean pls fight him
What  bout  Nick Diaz  though.
like philion said, we should just stop fighting jake paul and let him fall off the face of the earth, everybody just dont fight him xDD
Fight him sugar please lol end him
3 fights back to back to back? Jan 2020, Nov 2020, and April 2021 is not that close together, especially for a Novice. Mike Tyson fought every single month, sometimes twice a month when he first went Pro. It's not like Jake is injured. He hasn't even been hit yet.
Yeah dude I agree been watching both brothers for years and the kid has got mad talent.. he’s killer
Tiktok vs youtube winner. That's next for Jake. Jake needs a proper match. An up and coming boxer that's also 3-0
Man I was backing Ben the whole way, watched the interviews and I could tell he wasn't all too serious but he was confident he could win and I was confident in his fight experience. When I saw the face-offs the night before the fight and just how much Ben did not care and didn't even want to be there that's when I knew he was going to lose. Still backed him and it sucked he lost but never underestimate your opponent no matter who it is.
Triller threw an amazing event!?!?  Hahaha, wtf. Worst event I’ve ever seen.
KSI is what the world WANTS to see, but...Well see
That entire show was so cringy.  Terrible.  Glad I didn't pay for that hot mess.
Love this guy
I like the way you look at things very wise man great content 👍
🤡🤡
Wouldn’t call that an amazing event though lol just my opinion. Was like celebrity boxing/WWE/BET
sugar you should box him
I really love how professional Sean O Malley and smart yet when it comes to fights Hes the crazy back talking young smart ass kid that does damage but also we get moments like where u can tell hes beyond intelligent
Jake dont want to fight Diaz man trust me he gonna get hes ass kicked
Its insane jake the fake is taking over boxing. I dont see how people are really thinking triller is legit amd jake is a legit boxer.
Nice lid berry surprise
Jake should fight joe biden next.
Sean had a baby and grew up quickly lol. Happens to everyone.
"Everybodys watching" - Sean "yeah on other youtube channels" -Me "who the fucks paying for that trash" -Me
go on impaulsive!!!!!! that’s be so lit hearing ur life story bro
And the ref called it early???
You can tell he’s a JP fan. Ugghhhhhhhh
Suga's hair looks like a moldy watermelon
Ben got paid!
This is no different than a Scratch golfer playing a skins match against a swimmer with 3 rounds of golf total under his belt.
Sugar, come on my guy... I love ya, but saying Jake Paul can box... Come on my guy, I realize you holding his sack bc you young as him and youtuber as well, but come on man... HE IS BOXING NON BOXERS. PERIOD...
Jakes not a pro suga. Throw him in with a pro and watch him get exposed.
Sean your a good Dude men ! From one Dad 2 another... Peace and Bless from Germany !
Smart career move , doing it slow. Build himself slow, build greatness......SMART ON HIS SIDE!!!
I just cant agree with the skill of jake paul. He just threw a 1 2 , and ben just stood there with no reaction i mean the speed wasnt even crazy. Gotta see him up against someone he cant pick someone he has to test himself against. If he can win then he can earn respect other than that he can fight all these bums and sleep them nobody will ever respect him for shit!

You were pretty spot on about how it would all go down/how trash the fight would be because askren just can’t seem to understand how to box. He should of trained way more idk I had some faith it would go to the judges and Jake would win but damn another quick knockout and boring fight... Give Jake Paul and actual boxer at his skill level already holy shit
Why not have boxers who won fight same guy fight them in MMA? Then if the fight is 1-1 even record then go back to a boxing match to finish the trilogy
Ben looked like a fish out of water.  I would have done it for that much money but I'm poor.  I almost feel like been was representing the ufc and he sold them out.
0:22 I’m confused, I think Jake is better than people give him credit for but how can u say the first but say the second at the same time, if Jake boxed someone who you say isn’t a boxer, then how does that mean Jake can really box
HUH JAKE beat an old retired mma fighter / wrestler...who's next ? CM PUNK ?
imma buy u soap
HAHAHA flex
I didnt watch it they r not fighters. Lmao me pay for Youtubers. 😂😂 ok
But the win was 100% staged. The ref stopped the fight for zero reason.
I think accepting a boxing match when you're not a boxer is a mistake. What else can you get from this ? I get it, the two sports involve striking with hands but it's very different. Even more concerning ben.
Bro you need to be on Impaulsive!!!
Are we ever going to see a boxer enter the cage 🤔 maybe no wrestling kicks punches elbows ????????????????
I want to see sugar box jake
Gsp
Finally someone who can give an honest account of the fight and take in both sides without hating one or the other. All this is true and this is what the commentary of a fight should be, not snoop yelling “give me my money” over and over again.
TRUE FIGHT FANS WATCHED BOBBY KNUCKLES OVER LOGANS LITTLE BROTHER
Sold his soul at a young.
Fight was rigged.... the way he got hit was like if they rehearsed it smh
gotta love Arizona houses and their built in shelves
love this breakdown. real as shit
Why do you give so much credit for the combover weirdo? Here’s the deal i dont know crap about boxing but when i box my 83 years old grandma i look like Iron Mike too Lol 😂
Triller is trash. 🗑🚮🗑🚮
Guaranteed if the fight went the full distance Ben Askren wouldn't of thrown a single significant punch.
Would like to see him box Nick Diaz👀
Nick Diaz !!!
But why he calling out ufc fighter can jake go into the octagon
Dude the whole production was SO cringe
Come on!!!! Robbie destroyed his face, and he was still standing. Now one punch, and he dropps like a bag of shit..... Money talks brotha
He is a good boxer. But we all tuned in to see him get his ass kicked... just the minor possibility of it happening was worth $50. However maybe that event was awesome for you.. but for viewers it was a nightmare. All love suga glad you were there
I don't agree with having kids man 🤷‍♂️
I love you nigga
You should fight Jake Paul
I think Nate would win .
As a fan of Sean, if I was Jake and Sean was saying this stuff about me, I would be so hyped man.
Like how you want them to succeed. I want the same for you, keep it up!
Lmfao
Sean your my favorite fighter period!! Love the energy brother. Im wait to see you with the belt
Nick diaz needs a fight
Love the channel man.
Dillon danis is the answer, they already got beef and his hands are trash
He beat up a old man basically what did people expect
Pro boxers who fight bums to boost their record just do it for promotion though. Jake has enough hype he needs to fight somebody
0 reason to call out anybody in the ufc. They all under contract and active..dumb as he'll and for the clout...your statement about people wanting to see him fight someone really good is false. We want to see him against an actual boxer. The opponent doesn't have to be ali. Just a boxer.
You a real one Sean!
Sean, I want to challenge you in chess! I see the board in the background.
Let’s see Jake Paul vs Steve Cunningham
Triller is WAY too played out. I like to watch fights. What I watched was 3 hours of musical performances, a man get carried out on a stretcher from a glancing blow to his side, the announcers were all high as hell just joking on everything, and lastly I watched a professional fighter get knocked DOWN, not out, in a boxing match then proceed to get up and put his hands in front of his face while the ref stopped the fight. I didn’t even pay for the PPV and I still want my money back.
He wasn’t knocked out in the first round it was a knockdown he got up immediately jake started walking towards him with his gloves up and askren says can I fight? And that ref just calls the fight for no fucking reason what a shame.
Great video, really enjoyed your take on the fight! Non bias and very informative. I guess Jake Paul, whether you like him or not is a legit pro boxer.
Shit was so fixed its not even funny.
Complety agree with Suga, too many people are hating on Jake Paul! Just pure jealously!
I didn’t tune in to the fight. I want to see him box a boxer!!
Those guys that are fighting trash opponents to pad there record aren’t fighting main events! So if he’s fighting main events and getting paid then he’s he needs to fight actual fighters!
Please fight jake, take the pay day and get the dub for the people plsssssss bro
Jakes 1 & 0 buddy his other 3 fights we're against youtubers & NBA stars
It’s a fucking shame. Back in the day fighters wanted to prove they were the best by fighting the best not just marketing to make as much money as possible
3:08 That's a great point and it all smells fishy. Ben literally took it as a joke, was fat, didn't train at all. Jake was acting like he was 50-0 going against Mayweather. Even I could of beat Ben with how bad his mentality was going in. The unfortunate thing is how serious everyone took the fight as a whole.
"Triller threw an amazing event"  Cheeto must have given you brain damage bro, the event was a clown fest
This is truth
I love you sean o malley , I love you like a 2012 girl loved Justin Bieber
people love to hate on him cause he made millions off of not only scamming kids bit illegally marketing his merch to 8 year olds. damn suga do your research
Iys not the fact we love to have him, it's that we hate the fact he thinks he's the best after beat 3 non-boxers a YouTuber, a Retired NBA player, and Ben, a recently retired wrestler who's never won a fight on his feet.. at least fight someone with a boxing background.
Suga, thanks for not being biased. We appreciate you.
Gotta completely agree with Sean...
"what's next for jake paul?" prob boxing another fat person who's never boxed in their life and selling the image of being a world class athlete while you're a normie from ohio, some sh like that
Jake always calling out MMA guys at Boxing but never boxing guys...
Jake should box a jiu-jitsu guy next, would be so dope.
Get Sean on Impaulsive
Bro got paid a bag for not even 2 mins. Ben laughing to the bank
It was a terrible fucking event lol. what are you even talking about  it was just shitty celebrities circle jerking for 4 hours
The reff also stopped it Hella early
Fight Jake bro !!
For sure. Let’s go FULL BLOWN Celebrity Death Match now.
Yeah, but if fights a bum again, the PPV buys not be there. Going to the well too many times. Maybe with the  6 months offs, but he should go with Danis by then.
Bieber was literally missing notes the whole time and his voice broke like twice when he tried to get those high notes... How tf did Bieber perform haha
Bro you are such a sell-out, a real shame since you can Fight but hey Hopefully someone tries to knock you out the way you tried with Thomas Almeida by constantly going for no look punches...
Let's go Nate Diaz!!!
the baby scared the shit out of me
what about ur next fight sugaa?
Wow my daughters name is Alaina too 🤷🏼‍♂️ she’s 1.
You're a simpleton if you believe the fight wasn't bought 1 mil to lose Lol c'mon
This is the worse video you could upload Sean.  Talking about that fight as if it was something real or competitive is disrespectful to your fans man.  There isn't a sport created by man less competitive than that fight was.  People with actual brains know that fight was nothing short of a garbage money making scam and some of us with brains are your fans.  This is a sad video and that even was way sadder.
Woodley would trash him lol
Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. should fight Jake
The only 3 fights Jake has had have been against 3 absolute jokes, like honestly 3 of the worst "boxers" of all time to even step in a ring. He could have challenged his neighbours dad who hasn't trained a day in his life and he would have done better than all 3 of them. Fair play to Jake though he should keep hustling the boxing scene and taking the pay day. He has said multiple times though that he want's to be taken seriously as a boxer and that won't happen until he fights a real boxer.
Suga Shane is so call
So weird he's 3-0 on a "pro" career he's fighting non boxers figure he would be an amateur career until he faces another pro ?
Jake Paul vs suga sean....warzone kill race
Jake is larping as Ben Stillers character in dodge ball...  triler is Paul’s promotion...  looked phony...
I know Sean is being chill but Jake is only selling shit out because he’s a piece of shit that people hate and a YouTuber 🤷‍♂️ Sean puts asses in seats off actual talent and made his name on talent. Big difference imo
next week will come and everyone won't care
Amazing event?
your the next conor SEANOR
He’s not a boxer. He hasn’t fought a boxer!!!!
Nobody brought up frank Mir  He did great
Welcome to the show
Jake Paul vs tiger woods next LETS GOOOO
I like you, so I'll let your love affair with Jake slide. You're on thin ice, though.
Ben askrens son talkin shit about his daddy needin an asprin. 🤣🤣
It’s so dumb
Jake looked good, you can tell he put the work in... too bad it was against a retired wrestler.
Not everyone tuned in. Those of us with half a brain watched Whittaker put on a clinic instead of that bullshit.
Ben took the fight for the milli like cmon win loose make a million, why would he care!
Edmonds Woodway sucked..  Oh wait sorry..  Let's this kid fight a MMA fighter in MMA. Or better yet... Fight a real boxer.  Seems to be an avoided task, fighting someone who is a real boxer and or not washed up and old.  How about fighting an MMA fighter in an MMA match? Oh, that's right, it would prove he's just a scrub with a mouth and followers who are to weak minded to call him for what he is.  A phoney..
Sugar.... the most fun fighter to watch and we need more sugar
Street Beefs could have done better.
Why can’t jake fight in the octagon? I get he’s a boxer but cmon? In a street fight ANYTHING goes.
Sean “Jake Paul suck up” O’Malley
The haters are 10x worse than Jake Paul. At least he’s doing something with his life. I think he’s an ass too but to discredit him like people are, it’s trash
“ Amazing event “ 😂😂
1:27 😂
waiting for jake paul to fight CM punk, a football player, or wilder lmao
Jake has not fought anyone? A midget basketball player? A wrestler that has less boxing skills than Sean’s baby. Lol It’s all good, Ben at least got paid.
I just subscribed  Hey sugar Sean
Sellout
"Ben isnt a boxer....But this was huge win for Jake".....WTF?? LMAO     Ben is basically laughing his way to the bank on you cats.  #fixed
Sean is actually right about high level boxers getting to 20 - 0 by fighting cans. Why would Jake to 6 months off? He's fought 3 bums, took 0 damage, so he should strike while the iron is hot. Glad Sean didn't come on here and talk smack about Ben.
"Askren is built like a bag of milk" summed up the entire fight
I'd like to see him climb into the octagon.
I'll call him a good boxer when he fights a real fighter
Ben took a fall.  You can not change my mind. He flew on the ground. Got right up cleared eye. Then it was called. Fake!!!  Good for Ben making that money. And Triller is trash promo.
CANT WAIT TILL YOU ARE THE CHAMP!!!
it was a fucking show JAKE PAUL PAID BEN 100%
13-0
Sean made a good point about boxers beefing up their records beating up bums. I always wondered how they got so many wins
BJ Penn supposedly wants to scrap that would be the easiest fight with a big payday but if I was Jake I’d take the Tommy Fury fight... there both relatively new to boxing and there both big names
That event is what happens when the trailer park gets money.    It was a fuckin shit show all around.
"triller threw an amazing event" ya bullshit buddy that was the most unproffesional shit i've ever seen i watched it for free and stilll feel like i got robbed.
Thriller is a joke it will ruin boxing not that boxing isn't all ready day
I can’t believe how you all are so dumb. You do know that this fight was fixed? Easy money for Ben Askren and Jake Paul. It’s all about the money, you guys really think this was a legit boxing match? For further proof, you can watch the altercation between Tyron and one of Jake Paul’s ringside. When they were trying to manipulate Tyron to bet, they thought Tyron didn’t know their game plan. Little did they know Tyron already knew everything before it was even announced. It was all fixed yet he kept it real. He didn’t want to admit to everyone that it’s fake since he’s gonna screw Ben’s opportunity to become a millionaire. You guys are so unbelievable. Easy to manipulate by famous celebrities. Sheeeesh 🤮
Ben Asprin is not a boxer, I’d love to see a wrestling rematch to keep it a buck
He’s a superstar for acting like a moron.  Unfortunately, people really like watching morons nowadays.
I'm not trying to hate but the PPV was only 1.3 m dude hardly selling out.
no respect for suga anymore lost a fan
Yeah and u were observing those girls twerking real closely. 🤣
How is it a good win over a wrestler. Come on.
You're 100% right. It is all about mindset. If Askren can adopt your mindset, he's 1-0 undefeated as a pro boxer.  Great win, Ben!
MMA rules
Don't forget that Ben sold his legacy for $500K (MINUS TAXES) 🤦‍♀️ 🤦‍♀️
Alway's love getting your insight Sean you're gas, don't hold back
Nice insight on wanting to see mega fights grow!
Alanna what do you think😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃 ya me to
I'm not a hater, no hating shit but it's crazy how much money Jake been making off these fights real boxers had to build themselves up. Jake fought 2 washed up ppl a youtuber and a NBA player then he been calling out ppl who dont actually box. Of course he's gonna win against a ufc fighter who mainly knows wrestling and had to learn boxing in 12 weeks. Can we just get a REAL boxing match nun of this calling out ppl who aren't in boxing. No hating shit but what happened to all the hard work you've had to put into boxing, it's just for the money now and that's the big reason he calls out ppl who dont box
I like you Sean your a great fighter but that Triller event was the worst show ever it was garbage to watch and thank god i didnt pay for it
I ain't tuning into shit Jake puts out. The only reason Jake ever wins is because he picks people way way below his boxing level. I bet he loses in less than 2 mins against Ryan Garcia
Jake Paul vs Eddie Hall
you had women singing about there private parts you had everyone high on drugs and booze the cameras where a joke the show was complete garbage
I am not a fan of Jake Paul  , but from an outsider looking in his boxing fundamentals have improved a lot.. I mean when you have unlimited funding to do whatever the hell you want to and no responsibility in life you put your time and money into what you love the most and getting the best training money can buy he is going to improve. This being said its time for him to fight some competition. The idea of Tyron Woodley sleeping Jake would make me happy. Jake is doing something right ... People want to see him lose .
That was a terrible event the worst show ever i dont know what your on bud but that was a disgrace
Ay nice plant bro what is that a fiddle leaf or sum?
Sean spitting facts 🔥
The title lol
we need Prediciton who wins of every Fight Night of the UFC
Sean why you hanging out with that scumbag bro??
Wow, the fight actually happened? There was so much hype but I never saw a single date mentioned so I thought it might not actually happen... Nobody is talking about it, no videos on youtube... This one video is all I have heard about the fight actually happening...
bro this dude got like 71 IQ
Shoogah shawn U must have some irish sean  Always remember the irish november .... when the brits made ur ancestors take the coffin ships ..... to america for sanctuary away from the factory .... of death and starvation that we called this island .... after the british came
Triller event was cringe
Hair color fits perfect
This why you’re a superstar too bro, this mentality right here! I was a fan before but even more so now. Everybody is hating but still watchin. If anything, the whole JP thing to me is nothin more than extra entertainment I wouldn’t have had otherwise, I fuck with it.
Fuck that he needs to prove himself
Tyson Fury is the only fight that makes sense at this point.
The fact u have a multi-coloured Afro and can pull it off it’s madness
“Ben needs an aspirin” lmaoo😂😂😂😂
I'm not a Jake Paul fan at all but the dude is a good boxer and is getting better so you have to respect it.
Triller is the worst
Ben has always had a dad bod but the huge belly at the weigh in told you how serious he was taking it,    he just wanted that high 6 figure payday and who can really blame him,  he probably got paid more to get punched once than he did in his 3 UFC bouts combined
Guy needs to box other entry level boxers, not 36 year old fathers who are built like an office chair
Jake Paul love fest, you are a clown , unsubscribe
Giving credit to Jake like everyone should be doing 🤙🏼 all haters are jealous and can’t handle that someone with such a toxic personality can be good at something. Nothing can change hard work, simple. Look what happened
The event was trash, camera angles that gave views of nothing but ropes, Ben is not a boxer like you said so I fail to see how that makes jake a good boxer, jake is 3 and 0 and we not got to see much of his abilities so I don't think we can call jake a good boxer yet
This guy is legit. I respect his honesty
I dont think Ben really cares win or lose he was there for the $$Milli payday and when it was stopped Ben didnt protest he was fine with it being over and him $$Milli richer ,,,
The Triller event was a satanic ritual. Don't worry in our luciferian society will be many many many more
The best analysis I've seen.
Clearly the fix was in  Boxing is the most corrupt sport imaginable   Someone was like "but ben wouldn't take a big shot like that if it was fixed "   1 million bucks says different
Nate lol
Whats up CHAMP!!! HOW MUCH FOR A SIGNED PAIR OF GLOVES
i bet ben askren =(
Jake needs to fight someone who can actually fight not necessarily a pro boxer just someone who can strike back at least
Maybe an event that you would have had to be there for it to be good
E-40 performed?
Jabbin with the jabber
sugarshow time
You def got paid for half of what you said. Lmao You also just assume all people would make the exact same decisions based on their environment. I disagree, if you assume this then you take away all individuality.  Under this standard no one should be punished for crimes.  Love ya suga
Box him and KI
it’s so dope seeing sean go mainstream
Ya man it was fun to watch. 1.5 M PPV sales, biggest pirated events of boxing more than Floyd Connor fight. This shows that people were interested to watch but not buy it.
Huge cringey event. Waste
Plot twist he’s not wearing any pants
I bet on Jake Paul for a KO in first round 😁
“Triller through a amazing event” - Sugar  That was a bullshit WWE event.
How can you compare an apparent boxer to a non boxer. There is no comparison at all. Pick another young guy... TOMMY FURY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The difference between Conor and Jake is Conor is fighting the best thinking he is still the best but he’s not
Get him in with Tommy Fury. Same age roughly and same experience, LFG!
SEAN IS THE Tekashi69 of MMA 🤔 rainbow hair & tattoos 😂
Jake Paul is not a boxer , it was luck punch. Nate Diaz will retire him.
Subscribed to your channel bro. Cool hair :)
Nick Diaz? He's retired and ex UFC fighter....nah joking he wouldn't be ready for him even now but by time he's ready Nick Diaz will be alot older and non active
I don't feel like Ben was going to win in the end but that stoppage felt premature
I really wish jake the best.  Anyone want to bet me £100 he'll be world champ within 4 years?
The man has more that a point. How ever fights like this have a sole bass in fame and money. And if that’s the man catalyst what will the end result be.
o malley should link up with nelk boys
When is sean going to fight again?
Well said, sir. 💯🇺🇸💪🏻
Would he beat the sugar show in boxing??
Thanks for that Sean! People got to take it for what it is at the end of the day, and that is, entertainment. Triller has made something new billed for a younger audience and in these crazy times we are living in, I for one is glad everything doesnt have to be so f...serious. Oscar stole the the show with his commentary, I second that. Shit was hilarious.
Comparing conor to jake... suga, chito beat u ass stfu
Sean vs jake let's do it
Hes 3-0 against none proffesional boxers bruh... stick him with a journey man that actually is a boxer.. u will see the difference.. hes 3-0 celeb boxing, not pro
Maybe it’s time to get behind jake
This dude keeps it real.
This was more a concert, circus show then a boxing event.. discrace to the sport
maia next? LOL
Hands down the most crazy and fun show
Jake Paul is hated and you cant say anyone would act like that if they were raised by him, I actually like Logan..
I love this type of content Sean big up
C'mon you didn't just compare that casual Jake with Conor didn't you...
Jake vs Logan will be next, bet!
I love how real you are! Welcome to the sugar show!
Ben needs aspirin 💀😂😂
Wigger O'Malley?
O'Malley vs. Paul, eventually?
Youre the only one who praised the event wau
I want to see a wrestling match after now😂
For anyone that's actually a pure enthusiast of boxing or MMA, this was a waste of time and money.
Woul yo beat jake straight boxing?
Bruh the fight was garbage and easy to call. Look at Ben he was outta shape and definitely looked like he didnt care...  Why doesn't he fight a amateur boxer and give that payday to someone who actually deserves it...
your video is longer than the actual "fight". that whole event was a clownfest
Can't wait for Paul to fight some retired golf player next.
Jake is a good boxer but he really needs to fix his attitude and definitely needs to work on his conferences that was wayyy too cringey to watch. Respectful fighters are always the best.
People don’t understand just cause he’s a youtuber doesn’t mean he can fight .
Sean can you please sleep Jake.
tommy fury vs jake paul ???????
FIGHT HIM !!!! With one arm Sean, massive pay day!!
Ben got paid to answer those questions...it was part of the fight. The only thing MMA should be embarrassed about is fighter pay. Ben made more money as a show clown than he ever did as champion.
Yeah it's gonna be a fun ride while it lasts. Genuinely interested to see how he can do against ufc strikers in boxing know that we know he has some legit skills.
Jake doesn't want any part of either Diaz boys
Sean cmon now. Jake 1000% did not make a statement. Everyone knew what would happen and still decided just to hate him Bc he’s a shit person. U should fight him next tbh😂 u would whoop his ass I would love to see a person who actually knows how throw a 1,2 faster than 10 seconds. Cmon. Ben. Nate. KSIs brother lol and that one gamer who literally didn’t even train when Jake trained for months and that’s all he focused on 😂
The Simping on this channel is next level XD
The thing is i still don't know who Jake Paul is...His brother i've heard of with the Japanese suicide forest ...so that's his resume? brother of "famous" you tuber and amateur boxer?
dillan danis next for jake?
boxing is a joke either way a pro boxers 3-0 record is vs a youtuber, a basketball player and a wrestler those 3 were given pro licenses for this bs  atleast we gave cm punk a couple of YEARS to train
I fucking love who u are man!!
"Huge win for Jake" Yes.. Against a guy slower than my grandma 👵
Chito beat your ass
Tyron Woodley and Nate Diaz would absolutely maul Jake Paul..
I liked just cause the title made me laugh
ben askren was KO in 119 secs and in that time he earned as much money his entire UFC career.
Plz retire confused lil kid.
Man stop congratulating this bum man
No sorry, I was watching the ufc.
That ref stoppage was BS.
Wise words Sir, you're dead on. Thanks for the content.
Great breakdown
#Sugalife
Your daughter didn't have to get all political dude 🙄
Good assessment 👍I totally agree
I’m a huge fan of you Suga  I saw you at sprouts on central and bell and you completely ignored me when I shouted out your name
what do you think about Jeremy Stephens vs Drakkar incident?
He's a good boxer, if you have no respect for the sport.
Conor Vs Jake Paul 🔥 in a boxing match
sean vs jake please
Great analysis of the fight.  I agree, it sucked seeing Ben lose like that. But you said it best...he's not a boxer!
Yeaa jake paul is verry hyped i like it bro! As you said like conor. Ben thinks yeaa i want tha 1m and enjoy my life 🤑
Imagine he jus says fuck it does absolutely nothing but box then fucking gets a title
Ben looked like he worked out for the fight....at least one or two times
I reckon Jake should fight Vidal Riley tbh, Jake is 3-0 and Vidal is 4-0, yes Vidal has been doing it longer but size and weight wise around the same
That hair/tattoo combo is wilder than the wineland KO. Green and pink is underrated
It was fixed trash.
Bro rock the fro during an upcoming fight please... or I'm just not gonna follow you anymore... like the fro is why I started watching you fight in the beginning....
Love him or hate him, Jake is an entertainer
Jake paul is undefeated unlike you just jk
You should try to convince your friend Jakey to fight a real striker or boxer. Haha Then he’ll be a real boxer. 3-0 to no boxers. NO BOXERS. Maybe he can box, but he’s not a professional boxer until he fights real boxers in a boxing fight. Right now he’s just in celebrity league. Like Sparring friends.Ben.. the guy was eating donuts before he went out. He was in it for the money. So .. there ya go. Wasn’t cry worthy acting like he won years worth of working fo a title shot. Man wtf.. hosted by TRILLER.. that’s just as bad as hosted by tiktok .. Anyway Doja cat was the highlight of the night. And the guy who pretended to get hit in the balls.
Subscribed 🤟cool chat video
Rigged
I have a bad feeling if Conor keeps slumping this shit show could be a reality
Anddd you have a newww fannn sean
I said the same thing. He can't just fight the best guys. He needs to build it up.
Yo suga the pink rinse looks ridiculous btw 🙈🤣
And that kids is why a mma fighter  that can’t swing shouldn’t try boxing unless they actually know how to box lmaoo suga Sean vs JP next?? I wonder what hasben askrew is doing
I honestly appreciate you suga for having a brain and actually using logic when it comes to things like these
Love ya bro! Cant wait to see you get back in there.
Ben Askren looked like he had never had boxing gloves on in his life until last night (Suga please answer this question)   Do you think with all the experience Ben Askren has under his belt in his MMA career His stance to the way he used his hands even his guard during last nights boxing match with Jake Paul shows he has never really trained a day in his life for a standup fight? I believe Askren seen a way for a quick biggest payday of his life and never so much as put forth the effort to learn little fundamentals like foot work correct fighting stance he honestly thought he was way over skilled to lose to Jake Paul. He may have gotten paid but he will never live that down.  0-0 No professional fights 0-0 No amateur fights I’m turning 43 soon and I would love to be paid to fight Jake Paul and guarantee I would do better than Ben Askren that’s 😞
Sean seems like a good dude, ma man
Jake Paul should fight Dillion Danis or Tommy Fury next either one would be fine for me.
This Triller promotion is straight out of idiocracy
Suckin up quick
The fact that I have to respect his boxing hurts me. I have no respect for him as a person but his boxing is ok
why is Jake Paul chasing 155-170 pounders? Is he not 200 plus pounds?
hes not bro he is calling people out in mma bro i really want him to be in the ufc ring so he can really get fcked up
Build your own up like that too! Screw the haters .. and screw anyone that says you can’t ,. Shit you should set you up a few super fights to box with some well known people ! Get you some more traffic on your channel and name
Ha i called jake paul win so many times after watching their training footage bens boxing SUCKS! What the hell man , every vid he had his chin way up and hands down smdh
KSI vs Jake is the fight to make
Sean spitting facts rn
J Paul will never get into a real fight. Just boxing matches, against non-boxers. It'll be a beautiful day when he's finally taken out and we can stop pretending he's important. And MMA fighters needs to stop hanging out with him! Joke.
I don't think that he need to fight "the best" boxer. I think he needs to fight a real one. I think that's the real issue. If he really wants people to give him credit he needs to fight someone that's been training as much as he has. I get why a lot of people, including me, don't really like him. Being a good villain also sells because people want to see a villain lose and jake is a good villain, whether he wants to be or not.
Sooo you are recomending another RIGGED HOLLYWOOD fight... PLS ....  MOVE ON!! ..  Used to look up to him...(Ben) cuz he was always so authentic ... after that night .. after seing him smile, like he won (He won the money.) .. But money is more importent to him, that hornor.. come on.. pls... It was the most hurtfull thing I have watched..  it  hurts Sean... it hurts  .. I need - we need time to heal our wounds    ... T.T
Nobody’s telling him to face the best boxer they’re just telling him to face a boxer lol. Nobody he’s faced has ever had a single match prior to him. How can he call himself a pro when he’s never even faced an amateur?
Paul v Lobov
It was rigged.
I don't want him to jump the gun and hop in the ring with some championship boxer. But it would be nice to see him box someone that can actually box. So we can see what he can really do. It's going to get boring watching quick knockouts after shelling out money to watch a fight. I want to see a fight fight. And I'd like to see him win against a guy that can go a couple of rounds with him. I just wanted to see more.
Well said
I think he should fight Nikita Ababiy who is young upcoming boxer. They stack up well. Oh and just a side note this wasn't (by definition) a super fight.
Good show by Jake Triller was CRINGE!
Wanted askren to win out of dislike for paul but fuck you gotta give it paul at the end of the day. Although I agree i want to see more fosho
Always love hearing your thoughts on recent events and fights in mma man. Can’t wait to see you fight again Suga. Keep up the great work with the training, podcast, and all the shenanigans man
nick diaz is the fight to make for him right now
He should fight The Rock or Justin Bieber big money
Oscar was coked out of his mind
It was a big KO
Frank mir
Lame. Lost a fan.
He needs to box Nakita ababy
sorry sean i’m a fan but you have to admit this was a garbage event
Mike Tyson vs jake Paul
WorD on the grapevine jake paul is calling out tiger woods next
Dudes is basically a nerd that can kick your ass😂😂😂
Jake vs dana white
You are undefeated in my eyes! For real man if it wasn't for that injury you wouldn't have that loss and I don't even consider that a loss because he didn't beat you
Everyone bigging Ben up for the pay day, such loser mentality. He got knocked out with the world watching twice in a row, this time by a Youtuber. He lost all the respect from fight fans. He should’ve taken training more seriously. He seemed way too cocky leading up to the fight. I’m glad he got stuffed
Bro u gotta hop on impaulsive soon
Call out Jake Paul to a UFC rules fight!!
That wasn’t a fake knockout. Ben is terrible at boxing and he didn’t train worth shit. His fat trainer said that he himself was Ben’s sparring partner most of the time. Ben took this way too lightly and he paid with his and Uncle Chael’s reputation
Let’s agree Jake can’t be a main event for triller, nobody is gonna pay after the horrible Presentation that triller made😂
Got air pods in and absolutely shat a brick when heard the baby lol I thought a giant baby was tryna break through my front door
Fight jake paul and smash him bad...o  melley  go figth him
Man you so sweet ^^
Wow Sean said it perfectly, like literally, great advice for Jake and great breakdown of what happened..  And I also enjoy the buildup of big exciting fights etc let the show continue..
Excellent comments Sean. Very well spoken and some thoughtful observations. Also , generous “well wishes” too  which I found uplifting. Cheers. FJN
Jake Paul will quit boxing the second he gets knocked out.
You killed it this weekend networking wise. You probably had the best performance of the weekend.
Why take time off. The hype train is strong right now. He needs to book Dillon Danis on the Youtuber vs Tik toker card if possible. He took 0 damage this fight and beating Danis will elevate his name even further. That’s the smart move
Straight up that event was whack bruh
“Who’s the worst person I could fight” 😂
In all other threads people are trashing the event for the commentary, the performances and everything under the sun. Here they seem to like it. Just shows people are mad that Asscream lost😂
Yeah there was girls twerking and snoop got every one high
Hi Sean, hope dana don't pitch you another fly and you take a real fight for your next one. You are become the jake paul of mma
Event was trash. We don’t no if Jake Paul can box he hasn’t boxed a boxer LOL
Ben showed up for the pay check. What was weak . Jake still a bum
Jake is trash Ben is old af and is a wrestler this when don’t mean a damn thing
The sound of that baby scared the shit out of me lol. I was walking around my house like wtf...
Triller is crap. Paul can’t box and neither can Ben
Jake Paul vs Sean O'Malley? Oh wait, your a jake nut rider, he already making you mma fighters look bad. He would knock you out aswell.
When is Jake going to fight someone with a modicum of boxing ability? Until then he'll be a novelty act. Nate Diaz or even Robbie Lawler would murder him. Jake should call out Anderson Silva or Chris Leben if he insists on fighting retired MMA fighters. The fight reminded me of James Toney vs Randy Couture in that one fighter was clearly out of their element.
ez $ .
I dont know anyone that tuned in to this fight ... then again i am an adult . I saved my money . Boxer vs wrestler didnt spark an interest for me ... not enough to buy it . Only heard about it because i know who ben askren is . never heard of jake paul until recently
he said he’s showing signs of CTE so he cas couple of years left
V "Ben needs an asprin".....bruh.....do better.
Yoooo it’s the sugar show!!😁
BROOOOO. Im watching this video at 1 am. my son and girl are asleep. i keep hearing what i think is my son whining. i got up and looked 3 times!!!  then realized its your babyyy. hahaha
Woodley is a possibility because the ufc are probably ready to release him anyway.
Amazing event? It was garbage. Really bad production value. The announcers were terrible... Who hired snoop, the guy is insufferable... He does not shut up.
Lmao did the baby in the back have anyone else looking around like wtf 😂
Poor tyron is gonna feel like he has to avenge ben. Jake should never fight tyron though only cause its risky. Tyron may not be a professional boxer but he knows how to throw hands and defend. Would be more of an equal footing match lol
Ur the man G 💯
hi sean
Nate would destroy him!!!!
Dana is gonna say Paul KO’d a “retired” UFC fighter...He’s gonna let loose an Active fighter (Diaz or Woodley) for his own ego’s sake.🤞🏻
Ben needs an aspirin😂😂😂
Tbh I searche the snake Paul vs.@sşcream after Robert Whittaker vs. Kevin Gastelum - Colby Covington
That shit was rigged he not even trying to  fight real boxer
ben fought at 170
Amanda nunes He should fight Amanda nunes
Suga Shaaaaaannnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeeee
Triller put on the most God awful event I have ever watched.  I streamed the fight and still feel ripped off.  That commentary team made my ears bleed. The live music was horrendous and I'm pretty sure Ben took a dive. He had the biggest smile on his face leaving.
Sean vs jake fight in ufc so it’s not rigged, this I will watch. I want to see jake get destroyed in a real fight against a real good fighter. Like if you agree
100 percent agree with sugar man even before the fight I agreed with his pre fight assessment of the fight. Askren has not shown any boxing skills or even power in his previous fights. He is a wrestler who was not allowed to even clench in this fight. Ben really had no advantages. The shorter man the shorter reach older man less experienced in pure boxing (striking is not boxing) and Ben's mindset was all wrong from the start
Don't say poor Ben , you make fun of him I saw the video , you imitating him against fake Paul , you must respect Ben for what he did , I can also tell you that he was doing great and had a nice shot then he lost concentration and lost the fight if you dont believe watch the video , you also shout be together with MMA representatives than this blondies looking for easy fights with retarded ex fighters , Fake Paul need to fight real pro boxer his age  how about that ? Sean its never a good idea to making fun of any man because of karma my friend , you might get knocked out in your next fight as you ware already ..
Damn so he really knocked out ben? Damnnn
If Ben askren had a baby with a clown it would look like Sean o malley 😂🤡
Nate would beat his ass hands down
Bro you’re a superstar, McGregor is a superstar, Masvidal is a superstar. We tune in to watch you guys win. The world tuned in to watch him lose. Big difference. He can sell a fight but he’s far from a superstar and his press game is dog shit. He has the personality of a toenail clipping. We love you though bro. Much love my brother. #602 #480 AZ all day!!!!
Listening to this vid smokin this wood and hearin Sean O’Malleys baby scared tf outta me I gotta stop smokin🤦🏽‍♂️
1:27 I thought someone shot my cat
C'mon my dude. You chill with em for one night then show up here telling us how he's a pro boxer? Your a G my dude, respect your game but there's no way you mean that. These are celebrity fights. Not a professional boxing match. You're just feeding his ego for god knows what. I'll let this one slid my dude.
Suga is an ICON
Sean o maley is número uno ☝️ .
If Ben got 500k then he won also lol
Jake Paul won't last boxing 5 rounds w this guy he's too fast and slick . This kid is on his way to the belt
I don't think there is much chance to beat Nate, besides the sugar show that is, great guy that Bean Askrin, just can't fight.. izzy could win that fight all day ery day, other than izzy i could absolutely see MASVIDAL, McGregor, Whittaker, Kevin Gas, and the ONE & ONLY SUGAR SEAN O'MALLEY, THE REST OF THE DIVISION IS FULL OF PU$$!€S, THE NEXT BIG TITLE FIGHT WILL PLACE SUGAR IN POSSESSION OF THE BELT, POSSIBLY MASVIDAL.. SUGAR IS GOING TO WIN THE BELT EVENTUALLY NO MATTER WHO HE FIGHTS..
These PPVs are worrying Dana. UFC fighters are starting to want to get these superfights.
Suga sean man imma be straight up u ain’t the GOAT but you a damn good fighter I can’t wait to be able to bring you up in the in the discussion about the greatest bantam weight to do
Sug, wassup
Great vid bro
Sean just became a superstar for real , well deserved. Welcome to the life
paul vs o’malley big fight to me
Did you smash Father Kelsey?
Good for you bro you work hard they work hard you all deserve everything life has for you guys good people never quit
You the man sugar but that remark bout megan anderson was pretty immature frat boy sort of shit
Dude im so jealous of your style. Im not afraid to admit that. Growing up i always wanted to have a hairstyle like yours but couldn't. I always wanted to be a ninja too and just never pursued it, i skated and fucked around with all sports and stayed active but just never embraced that ninja i always wanted to let loose. I think you, Conor, and Izzy are my favorite fighters ever. Just for the sake that you guys get in this flow and fight how you feel like and it reminds me of like some Bruce lee kinda shit but with your own style. Honestly just keep doing you man, your shit is the shit! I feel like it's going to get you to the top if not set a new ceiling to things because you are definitely a one of a kind kind of style and personality. Keep killing it bro!!!!
What about the ref? They let frank Mir hump his guy for 2 mins At a time and the sec Ben touched Jake the ref jumped in..it was so rigged and not fair..boxing isn't fighting its for entertainment and this showed
Im so happy this dude Exists I never been a fan of somebody I liked more than this dude.
When it started I was like “oh fuck Ben ur fucked”
It was amazingly bad that’s for sure.
People going against Jake cuz no one like him
Jake should see this video
Aint he the guy that looted the AZ mall
This man got a soul of good!.    just human doing the best aye
Nate would hurt Paul lol
the Disney kid from a rich pampered family beats the former mma champion. sheesh.
So all it means is anyone given a shot can be called a pro fighter if you can live being a pampered ahole like Paul seems to have no pride in it.
That was a shit show worse event ever......
I was busy watching Bobby knuckles put on a real performance along with Kevin showing the heart of a warrior. Screw supporting ppl that carry themselves like Jake Paul.
In my opinion ben definitely threw in the first round to get home and go to sleep as quick as possible
Chess board, nice
"Everyone tuned into this fight" yea illegally 1🤣 I would be pissed if I paid for that circus 🎪 Didn't some dude get pulled out on a stretcher for a nut kick that didn't hit his nut? 😂😂
Ben Askren? Jake Paul knocked out Ben Askue last night.
You should mop Jake
From what we seen that looked good
J
Wow I can't believe alaina went there that's crazy. Wasn't expecting an infant to have such a savage mindset but it is sugas baby so that's probably why her take was sweeet. 😜🤣
Riggggggggggged
God bless Ben wow
I never tuned into the fight at all Put Paul or logen here I’ll smesh him  Not your rubber square. I’m losing more respect for you Shawn And the fight was rigged  Ben could have kept fighting afterwards  Btw ask Robert or kelvin to box the kid he’ll get smashed too
Great advice
Fuck can i see one person just one person be real ?  That shit was a fix and a money grab .. Seriously bro ?  No wonder you're "undefeated"
Literally everyone that was there had Sean on their story. Suga's presence was the main event.
Sean, your my new favorite fighter dude...watching you fight is like watching artwork..
One of my life goals is to meet you. #sugarshow
there's no way you actually enjoyed that card, everything about it was a joke
lol ppl tuned in to see him lose. no way that happens again if he fights another bum
For all the noobs who think the paul askren fight was rigged... yall are idiots
if your hatin on jake paul for not fightin a killer then u gon hav to hate for a while. Coz he gon go 20-0 before fightin a real Boxer😂 and rightfully so
Walmart McGregor lol
Jake needs to fight a real boxer, not another MMA
Who else would love to see Sean Omalley vs Jake Paul ?
Worlds duchiest boxing match... ever... or until his next match up.
God bless you Sean we love you
I fucks with you. Speaking facts
Bruh triller aint lasting long enough for this dude to build himself up slowly, shit was trashhh..
“Triller threw an amazing event”   Ok Sean...
Real!
Are you sad Mr. Sugar?
I like the part about supporting the fighters. When  they eat... So do you! Smart man @sean
Damn bro u were wrong asl about ben i lost hella money lmao
you a real ass dude
i could be wrong but im sure most the views was for ben. ben has a punch on him tho
Exactly how jake looks at it who’s the worst guy I can fight spot on bc we got millions of kids using there dad’s credit cards to watch the fight
My 4 month old puppy has better Boxing technique than Ben
I wanna see jake Paul fight a real fighter
Your child noise background scared 😨 I thought I saw haunted 💀 😅 🤧bless her
My issue is with people is, they say oh why don't you fight a real fighter.  Well he did and knocked him out. Now they say oh fight a real boxer, or the fight was rigged. Truth is people won't be satisfied. I'm not the biggest jake paul fan but he deserves his respect point blank. Honestly I think he is or could be better then half these boxers out here.
I got one question did you smoke one with Oscar?
BUT THE BOXERS YOU CALL BUMS WOULD SLEEP YOU JUST THE SAME..
Suga can we get you to box Jake?
The only fight that makes sense is Jake Paul vs Dillon danis it would be an upgrade to Ben askren and I see Jake beating Danis. Tommy fury would be a great fight but as we know Jake Paul won’t fight a boxer.
It will get old fast. I like real fights.
Ben aspirin
Jake Paul vs Sean Omalley
how can we really say jake paul can box... lets see him fight an actual boxer and win then well see
My boy suga
Jakes at least sparring some real fighters. He could eventually box a real striker/boxer. Id like to see Suga fight him and I don't mean Shane Mosely :)
Can the AirPod people get a baby warning, I’m too high for this shit man lmao
No one should feel bad for Askren, he took 1 punch and made a million. 90% of the world would to love to be in Ben’s shoes!
Dog suga I grew up 5min away from the dude. North Olmsted vs. Westlake in all sports in school. The dude grew up loaded and mooched off big bro. I give credit where it’s due but that fight was phony bro. Wanna talk about a dive.. Ben snagged the bag and purposely leaned into that punch and to make it a minute long and walk out perfectly fine smilin with his wife.
Not only did Jake take training serious as he always has been for the last 3 years but he had someone close to him die recently motivating him to win.
I keep telling ppl bro... I don't like Jake but all these divas online act like he should fight tyson alot of boxers for the first 10 fights, fights tomato cans Jake's rec looks better than alot of boxers lol
Ben needs an aspirin lmaoo
100% Jakes been training 24/7 for the last 3 years...He's clearly developed some skill set in striking/boxing...I give him props for the dedication and what not but I can't give him total respect for picking shit competition...A youtuber, a basketball player and now a mma fighter known for wrestling/grappling. It'd be like if a known wrestler/grappler joined got into MMA and called out nothing but pure boxers or something...It's a mismatch and I'd like to see Jake fight anyone that actually has business being in the boxing ring. I think Joe Fournier(the pink shorts wearing dude) from that same event would prob be a good idea imo.
sober sean :o
I didn’t tune into it. Waste of fkin money. Who gives a shit
Exactly he will fight another guy who can't really box . He will beat them and it will make a ton of money.
Ben really didn't care about this fight
I dare him to fight woodley please 😫
And by the way... that is the mentality of a future champion: DO NOT HATE WHEN SOMEONE WINS OR CELEBRATE ANOTHER MAN DEFEAT. Props to Sean.
You have to avenge your dad! Quit being the dysfunctional son mr.
Lmao this was a fight , jake took on a out of shape past his prime wrestler , not a boxer , he never was , he never won a fight in UFC BY BOXING , hey jake fight someone who’s actually a fighter not another bum, because all this is doing is making jake Paul think he can really beat a great puncher, and it’s going to be a bad day when Jake wakes up 3 days later after stepping into the ring with a REAL FIGHTER, It’s all fun and games until someone turns off your lights 30 seconds into the 1st round. All this proved was jake can beat up a older wrestler and get paid.
Haha...I made that "Aspirin" comment in IG
The after party looked fun Sugar! Glad you had a good time 😃🎉
quit giving this clown clout...
Bro you’re trash too stop tryna be a leach lmao
There were girls twerking.... it was crazy.......... it was crazyyy.......      Sean Suga
1:27 that noised scared tf outta me I thought that was something in my house
He should fight that dude from the subway commercial that lost to caleb plant
I'm watching this video alone at a hotel on earphones.  His dog scared the shit out of me.
The people calling to fight a real boxer are the ones who are fueling his success,  he is playing on how much they hate him.  Ben's performance was pathetic. MMA community has egg on their face because it's supposed to be a step down for them to box. Pre fight everyone was praising Ben's former career and achievements but all of a sudden they say he was just a middle-aged dad and no big deal?
that event was one of the cringiest things ive ever seen
Jake Paul can't box. He can just box people who can't box. He can sort of box basically.
Sugar: Alayna what you think  Alayna: Sugar: yeah me too lmao 😂😂😂😂
Nice analysis.
Bro Ben didn't care
Sean oh my leg 😂
Fight him
Bro that knock out looked weird...I'm sorry but I'm not no ben askren fan..but that shit looked crazy.
Bro goes watch that match in slow motion, That match was fake. Jake hit ben skin only, the KO didn't go through the ben head.
Oscar screaming about russians and Americans for an hour stole the show, and Pete Davidson as a host, trolling the guy that trillers trying to promote was epic
“Biggest payday, and who’s the worst guy I can fight”
Yesssirrrr
Dillon danis would be the guy then
Box Jake bruh and avenge your father Ben 🙏
🙀🙀🔥🔥
Lil baby in the back like "Dad, why tf you talkin to an inanimate object... Also, what's an inanimate object..."
Bro..u know the NEXT fights gonna be a UFC fighter. Uncle Dana is gonna wanna get his money back. If I was Dana,I'd throw him NICK Diaz!  Nick's NOt currently active, has been training tho hasn't fought in years. And he's Jake's weight class.  Jake vs Nick Diaz would do about 1.3-1.5 mill.in PPV. Imo.
Hair and outfit looked so fucking dope.
Jake paul is looking to get recognition from this tho and he is fighting jokers he keeps complaining about people not taking him serious but the fact remains dude can box but he boxes jokers I just wanna see him fight someone that can really throw hands even if its bisping lol he calls all these dudes out he knows he isnt going to fight then picks the worst person possible lol
Props to Ben man everyone can learn from that mindset of not letting things ruin you and keep moving forward. The guy stepped into a boxing ring made a bunch of money for his family and walked away
said it all within the first minute
Suga earned that aspirin🥳
Sean should fight jake
Cute kid, bro. Glad to see role models that are also good fathers, keep it up! 👍🏻
Who the fooooook is this BOZO?
Not to mention he’s not even fighting real boxers so none of those fights should count, let him fight a real boxer and he’s fucked
Hes definitely being an entertainer not a boxer. Jake is 23 Ben 36....... Jake should call out Canelo next.
I mean but he’s getting everything handed to him for the simple fact that he’s rich and comes from money he didn’t start from the ground up he didn’t go though amateur leagues or fights, he hasn’t done anything a real pro fighter has gone through, he woke up one day and decided he wants to be a pro boxer and now he’s considered a pro boxer lol that’s a complete joke tbh
Jon jones vs jake paul
my bad suga i was watching some real action from whittaker putting in work. 50-45❗️
I didn't even know this shit happened. Fuck all that; i ain't paying no money for that. But I'll support Suga.
I agree, I get he’s playing the “Heel” or the “Problem Child” cuz it’s the fight game but I literally do not understand why people love to hate Jake so much.  I was at the bar and I bet $150 on Jake and over half the bar booed when Jake came out.
Well it has been proven that Jake can box but he just fought one of the worst strikers in MMA history... great grappler but not a boxer... Jake also beat some YouTuber and a retired NBA player... I need Jake to fight a real legit boxer... like Dustin Porier or something I need him to beat a boxer for me to believe that he is the real deal... that's all I gotta say
2 million dollars cheers for Snoop Dogg 😁👌🏻👌🏻
Jake boxed Mike Perry and didn't get knocked out..  He's obviously got some defensive skills. Jake can obviously hit hard.  It looked like Ben let Jake hit him..   We could see the punch coming a mile away. You see he had already thrown it and just missed.. So Ben should've known it was coming again.  🤷🏼‍♂️  Jake and these people are too Hollywood.. Meaning they pretend and fake shyt constantly.
Would you fight jake paul?
Joe Biden looking ref ruined the fight. What did he want Ben to do? Pat his head and rub his belly at the same time? Man was on his feet with his hands straight up.  Terrible early stoppage 😪
Brooo the hair is cleannnnnnn
bruh your baby scared the shit outta me. I had my headset up loud and thought someone one was dying in my place
I also hope Suga keep winning 🚀
sean vs jake paul. lets see it happen. get that money!!!
🤙🏼
would you fight him ?
Everyone tuned in to watch him get KOD that’s what it is. So hopefully the next one he does he hits the canvas for good.
Ben Asprin
Jake Paul making millions
I don’t think he should fight the best boxer but a guy who knows how to punch would be nice
The fight to make is Jake Paul vs Daniel  Cormier!
Dude! Your the man and this video it the nail on the head!  SugarShow superstar status!
Sean vs Jake who would win
Triller sucks
Back in the day fighters like Charles bennett would run up his ass n it wouldnt even be about the $
" "Most money, worst fighter"- Sean O'Malley " - Chael Sonnen
Fight TWood
Feed him Adesanya..hewill get KO outcoled
The Suga Cartel
Came for the commentary. Stayed for the funny comments by people who are terrified by the sounds of a child at play. If you think this is bad. You should try being a parent. Someone could break into your house with a chainsaw and it wouldn't phase you. Followed by shooting said leatherface in the head with a shotgun, and going back to sleep. Sleep deprivation will do strange things to you. Children just have a way of grinding you down until you wish for death. Not that they can't be a good thing. But God Almighty are they exhausting. Which is why it's very important for you personally being ready for such a dedicated and protracted commitment. Which makes me think of something very funny my little sister told me about. The worst nightmare she ever had was having a dream that she had a baby that just kept staring at her with vacant eyes in it's crib. She was so freaked out she almost got a hysterectomy the next day.
Imo it barely ups Pauls stock bc we all knew Ass-Q (lol jake prob paid Buffers little bro to pronounce it wrong🤣) has worse boxing than amatures.  Give it time Jake will get exposed when he fights a real fighter. Hes obviously will cherry pick some more easy fights and get wrestlers or ju jitsu guys to box him for a few more fights LOL
You're forgetting Ben is 50-0 mentally
No one is talking about Ben opening up with a huge counter overhand right that stunned Jake and had him running away. Ben had ring rust/not a boxer/ belly weight against him in the knock down, he was never ko’d. Ben was good to go when he got up. With the amount of money on the line with bets/gambling, the ref should be jailed or at least tried sabotaging a sporting event. He didn’t give Ben a chance to fight, it’s literally criminal.
I get hes gonna get memed for the loss but ben had nothing to gain for taking that fight. He fought 20 lbs then what he normally competes in and is literally about 5 months out of a hip replacement. I'm not gonna look at him any different,I just feel bad that that's going to make people forget he would tie up 95% of the population into a pretzel.. But bag was secured so good on him for that
Smartest thing I’ve heard anyway say on this shit was when he said boxers will go 20-0 fighting 🍅 cans! So true!
My g.f. doeant even know who jake paul is which blew my mind cause it seems like everyone knows him but believe it or not everyone didnt watch this fight or cared
LEGEND
Triller threw the worst boxing event of all time bar none.
Its gonna be dillon danis. Boxing grapplers arent super fights
Woah there were fights at that concert?
I don’t think as meant people will tune in the next fight if it’s on triller 😂 that whole presentation was a joke
Dillon Danis?
Put Jake against a Middleweight or a light heavyweight. Give him a REAL challenge
Props for sayin it how it is !💯 ppl love to hate on Jake but the reality is...Jake can box. I have nothing but respect for Jake stepping out of the child star mold and making his own name his way
Ben literally kept his head straight up the whole time. Hes so not a striker that anybody with 3 yrs of boxing training could beat him.  Basic fundamentals destroyed him. A 1-2 and it over? LOL For real.
Jake vs Suga i wanna see that Id pay big money
Yu god and support Ben and then go party with Jake. Fake ass clout chaser. Should call u 69. Yu the sell out. No loyalty. When did men stop being men. . . . geeze
Jake Paul is a fraud
Dude you are so smart everything you said in your video is correct and I hope you listen to your advice because you’re right and Dam this is a good video
Jake gave him exactly what he had Ben Askren for!!! 😎👌
Looked at my baby monitor 15 times
looses a charity pro wrestling match looses to game-bread and mia looses to jake paul
so hes a good boxer because he beat someone who isnt a boxer ?
Lord KSI
Askren is a wrestler, not a boxer. Jake beat a NBA player, and a UFC bum. He hasn't accomplished shit. Put Jake against a REAL boxer. Better yet, bring Jake to the UFC. Thats what Tyron was really talking about.
Nah people just want to see him box an actual boxer.
Naw I aint rocking with u on kicking it with jake Paul...u lost respect from me
1 thing to ben didn't  get a chance to get started idk why they call it a knockout jake never knocked him out,  he got up said he was fine and walked foward the ref stopped it bc everyone knows he coming out of jake's pocket.         AND ITS FUNNY BECAUSE WE KNOW JAKE PAUL IS THE TYPE OF DUDE TO PULL STUFF LIKE THAT!
Yeah but the fights didn't make it out the first couple rounds lol. He could easily keep fighting every few months. Ben looked like trash, over weight, he didn't look like he even trained for this fight. He is a good dude but this fight was not it. Also the ref shouldn't have stopped it, Ben was standing, let them fight.
Yeah.. I agree ... People need to stop hating on Jake Paul...
Here's a thought, call out, you know, an actual boxer. Lol
People who watched the event for free wanted their money back.
Suga vs Jake next , pls make it happen .
Sean needs to fight Jake
Instead of Nate Diaz it would be awsome if he would take on Nick Diaz so Nick could get a nice payday.
it ended early bro cmon
Sean is the coolest guy in UFC. I wish I had a friend like him. For real. Despite his major success in his UFC career he remains super humble and never hates on anyone which is what makes him stand out of the rest. Keep being you legend
Its weird how so many people ignored Jakes obvious talent just so they could gatekeep for MMA and the UFC. Its bizarre actually. People were posting Askren Wrestling Highlights as if that was the key to winning. Mike Buffer called him "Ben Askew"...thats how much respect Ben commanded going into this fight.  I remember folks talking about how Ben CRUSHED JAKE in the PRESS CONFERENCE.  Folks are looking really stupid right now, comin up with all the reasons why Ben lost. THE REF WAS PAID...THE FIGHT WAS FIXED...BEN TOOK A DIVE. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHHHHHHHHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
Worse show ever. More music than boxing. Cameraman was filming the ropes and showing the high/drunk commentators all fight. Jake is trash
I see you got that chessboard man. Is it for show or can you play pretty well? If you are ever up for a game, I am an avid chess player on lichess.org and my username is TheSultan31003.  I was a former pro mma fighter as well but have since retired and just work as an engineer nowadays but still follow mma. I watch all of your fights btw. I think you're cool man.
love you sean!
Your a badass to man and I agree it’s exciting to watch him fight he might just take everybody out. So what he’s paid he’s on that grind💪🏻
“Yeah me too”😂
It wasn't fun to watch..... we live in hell.
Fair play to jake on his win, but see as though you work for the ufc I thought you may have supported ben on this fight, genuinely think ben got robbed of an early stoppage though... thoughts on danis next? He was like sign the effing contract now let me save the mma community.... maybe woodley yes but after what jakes shown of his power its difficult to make a decision.
Lets see Paul box Anthony Pettis , Nick Diaz , Cowboy , M Johnson. Any of those fights would be interesting.
O'Malley vs Jake  ?????
My favorite ufc fighter man love your style brotha and digging the YouTube channel
Sean you fight at 135 and would mop the kid even in a boxing match
"Triller threw an amazing event"  are you for fucking real dude? Shit was an embarrassment.
Most people that are haters live sad lives, and there are a lot of haters in this world, it's pretty sad
You should fight him👀
From a real fighter . It’s amazing how many dweebs can’t admit what you just did . Why we love you suga
Nate will X jakes eyes no doubt
Made it past the Mir Cunningham fight before i turned it off. Had it muted and was watching other stuff all during the black empowerment music stuff. What a trash show really. UFC was by far the better event
1:26 I had headphones on that baby scared the shit out of me
he was up before the count and that ref was rigged though
He should fight KSI next for the money
I don't  get it. Jake Paul KOs Ben yet spends 10x more time on the canvas and crying
Love this man
Jake has beat up bums! He's beat ppl who don't box! Never did box! He's not selling anything but shit. Last night was shit, Literally shit. 3 hours of wasted time..
And another thing just to show you what a PUSS Jake is.. Tyron Woodley said "I'll fight you".. Jake immediately tried passing the fight to his friend, and said he wants to fight D.C. 😂 Another RETIRED OLD DUDE...  Cant make this shit up! 🤡
This guy, Fake Fall is loathed by the MMA community and given your own popularity if it were me, i would do all i could to stay as far away from the guy as possible. As for his ability, hes had 3 fights and has yet to be tagged, so we dont know how his Very ample chin can absorb some big shots, if even ONE.
Woodley could be out of the UFC soon I wouldn’t mind seeing that
A Great event?  You need to watch the television view.  It was terrible..
This dude Definitely wishes he was Team 10... 😂 Lol.. only problem with this is.. no one is going to keep paying to see him fight "bums" 20 more times.. most people from what I'm seeing ain't paying to watch another Triller/Jake Paul match again anyways.. Jake keeps talking like he's the REAL DEAL so let's see him fight a REAL DEAL Boxer or striker from the UFC.. no wants to see another Dork get punched like a punching Bag.. Ben Askren had no business being in there .. and that's why Jake picked him.. he stood there flat footed, hands down, no defense, no movement..  good thing you can watch fights for FREE that wasn't worth paying $10 for! Jake Paul is a puss..
Jake has to step up the competition to keep a lot of the viewership.  Prob a legit older MMA striker who he has another significant weight advantage on.
See id have more respect if he called out actual boxers not ball players or wrestlers and hell if u are gonna call out ball players call out LeBron call out a big name player not a short lil dude he's fought bums 3 times no u want grail  fights call out top talent boxers!!
love your content , you should be careful with your hair tho ! don't become bald o'malley at 30. Take care
He should fight Nick Diaz
Yeah me too
Well said 👍
His new name is Ben Aspirin
I bet Jake believes he could take the suga show out pretty quick
suga show was getting it in ATL
WOULD YOU BEAT JAKE PAUL
Nah bro KSI will do the job.. hes our last resort.
Valid points as always lmao
Was it an “amazing event” though? 🥶
What if Ben Askren threw the fight just so Dana White would lose that million dollars?
Finally someone that uses knowledge & just doesn't bash poor Jake why would people want him to fight the best when the best fought the weak to be best fighters Jake for now is 3-0 can't wait to see what's next love ur hair dude I'm rocking with it take care much love everyone❤️
why doesn't take jump into the octagon with these people? lol then lets see what happens
I agree with your analysis 100%
Some good realtalk with Suga Shane, at 4:00 AM Sahur time, lets go
That whole show was garbage just like Justin Sheber
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j47lo4_h-Bw
I feel like Ben had a plan or jake paid him IDK Then rt after he got dropped he popped back up instantly. Who gives a fuc# I'm just glad Ben got a pay day but Bobby knuckles won and got paid significantly less
What about him fighting James Vick? Decent hands and he is available
Why do you mma fighters call jake out to a octagon don't get it put him in his place. Nate diaz a different animal then askren. Nate diaz would kick his butt before the fight even starts jake and his yes man have big mouth. Diaz brothers don't play that sh**
People are jealous of Jake and are hating of him because he is making millions at 23. I'm impressed an Youtuber can make $65 million in less than 2 minutes. Jake is living the dream.
Nahhhh, he needs to fight more
JAKE PAUL VS TYRON WOODLEY MMA
Paul Brothers vs Diaz Brothers
Lol Ive never paid for a paul fight cause I got my good old trusty crackstream
Thank you for your take on his next opponent! Everyone expects him to fight a monster.. why would he do that!??! People wanna see him fail that’s all it is, every other pro boxer started out with straight trash cans as well.
the only thing i found wack about the fight was ben's attitude,  all nonchalant, lose win idc ... pussy shit imo
I agree I felt for Ben after this fight... so embarassing and so sad man.   But congrats to him for getting that coin.  Jake is a beast.
Chito vera.....ijs.
You vs Jake sounds like a good fight to me lol
Cerrone. He can do it
Paul was the favorite. No suprise at all. Askren is trash.
Just goes to show the difference between boxing and mma the ufc in particular. Sean admitted most boxing pros get bums to build their record which is what Jake is doing fighting the worst possible boxers he can. In the ufc young guys get like 2 bums and then get thrown to the sharks making boys become men. There’s no gimmes in the ufc. Jake can hype himself up build up his record get all of u guys to hate him and keep doing his thing eventually he’ll challenge a real boxer and hate his life forever. Don’t worry boys his time will come!
Honestly I always thought O’Malley was just a Walmart McGregor but glad I actually took the time to start watching his channel. I had the guy completely wrong and now I’m a suga fan. Dude is legit a genuinely good man and he’s fcking hilarious   Subbed
Some ideas for future opponents:   -CM Punk (@ 180 lbs)  -50 Cent (@ 195 lbs)   -Logan Paul (Big money maker) -Brendan Schaub (@ Hwt) -Colin Kaepernick (HWT?) - Common (@190lbs?) -Miles Teller (@ 180 lbs) - Charlie Hunnam (@190lbs) -Michael B Jordan (@ 185 lbs)
Jake Paul vs Sean O’Malley
Dude ben really dint get busted up at all   he just took a loss jake deserves the win for sure .
I feel like Ben never gave a shit and was like a million bucks for me to talk shit and let the YouTuber get a "win" to boost his status as a boxer by beating a former champion in mma and an Olympian. Cool.. I don't give a fuck.  Let's wrestle next time... Jake would never accept. Ben still cool and jake forever a douche. And masvidal is my favorite fighter.
all that trendy mainstream shit you care about is fake and toxic.   hes not a super star there are millions of us that still have no idea who he is nor do we care,   people keep forgetting Ben is a fucking OLYMPIAN.   that trumps everything, ufc you tube boxing.   period.  how many people can say they pinned the fuck out of everybody in the Olympics lol
Tyron is probably getting cut so I see that fight being next.
We want you to keep winning and blowing up!!
Can Jake please just fight someone real
He dove suga come on now I know you saw the same thing I saw
Jake Paul vs Your Calf. Let's get this done.
But he won’t call out real fighters like suga or in Spanish asucar
I’d beat Jake Paul
I support u to the absolute fullest my dude. Love and happiness to you, tim, rick and the family. I love the pod. 👊👊👊👊
Who has fought more Tomato Cans, like for Sean comment for Jake!
I wouldn’t call it an “amazing” event
And your talkin about this like it wasn't set up. WOW, and your still wanting to talk like it was real. Just fuckin, WOW! PLEASE O'WALLY PLEASE
Jake needs to fight ksi. Give him another full training camp
Twood would be sick
Event was shit lmfao
He set up that shot by missing the fist one two and then doing the same exact thing Ben don’t move his head. Yea he’s doing his thing he’s a celebrity but he’s still a tomato can of a fighter 🍅
I just wanna know why if all 3 of jakes wins were against guys that aren’t actually boxers how does that really validate those wins? Yeah sure Jake can look good out there but I just want him to fight another boxer. Another guy that has been training boxing for at least as long as he has. All of his opponents just picked up boxing training for their fight against jake and a 3/4 month camp isn’t enough time to get you prepared for someone who’s been training for 3 years
I don't think it's very likely that Jake will ever be World Champion but I'm curious to see how far he can go.
You are a really nice and positive guy. I would agree with most of what you said, except that the event was entertaining. To me, it highlighted why I like the UFC, bellator and One. They are so much more entertaining and well-run than Triller.   You Sean, in particular, have really fun and interesting matches. Your last one, I was on my toes. There was nothing like that in the triller show. Nothing.
Lol 😂
Hopefully the next show wont be a fucking garbage fire. What a shit event
Can you hate us for not calling him a pro boxer since he hasn’t fought a pro boxer 🤷‍♀️
I think you should call out a name instead of the guys you've fought!
Askren gets knocked by Jack and well damn shit was crazy
Sean the sellout. Triller bad for boxing good for business. So far. I stopped watching triller after the tyson vs jones jr spar.maybe o'malley smoke to much weed .
4 rounds against guys that don't box.....my great grandma would have looked just as good!
Don't call yourself a boxer when your RECORD doesn't include a professional boxer. Go against one. Then I'll support. But I do congratulate to jake. He won. Earned.  But take on a boxer.
God man you're dope. It's so refreshing to hear someone not just be blindly hating on Jake, like literally everyone else. Nobody can give any credit where it's due. People are pathetic. Hatin' ass bitches
was a fan but i cant root for anyone who befriends jake paul first masvidal now sean smh
i wonder how long it took u to thnk of this title
13-0 #SUGASHOW
I'd settle for him just boxing another boxer . Maybe that would work .
Bro no one was goin against him lol he was supposed to win, did u see the odds, I do not agree with u saying he looks like a 3-0 pro boxer... he fought he non fighters...he looked good, but anyone can look good against someone who doesn’t actually fight.
Thank GOD Sean. That was so perfectly said and the amount of haters that this kid has is insane. Everything from what u said top to bottom is what I hate arguements with people on. Why wouldnt you do what he does. Makes insane money doing it and why not keep that up. Had to show that GGG 3 first opponents were like 30 wins and 200 loses and Mike Tyson had like 17 wins and 130 loses. I'm turning into a big fan of Jake the boxer Paul, and when he shocks the world again and knocks out a real boxer, whenever he does, people are going be real mad.
Fucking love you Sean! You look like a GTA character. Love it
If you call yourself a boxer.... FIGHT A BOXER!!!!
Name of the game is Training keep training!!!
“Amazing Event” LOL   it was complete trash.  The announcing was trash.  The audio was trash.  The competition was trash.   I hope this thing helped your social media and merch sales 😂
loved your prediction video, i thought ben askren was actually some of the only class there that whole night,
He needs to fight a amateur boxer....not regular guys or wrestlers
Paul dannis would be a logical next step I reckon
Go watch Ben Askren eat punches from the Lawler fight. Then tell me how jake paul knocked him down with that punch. He took the money fall lol
Wow that combination of colours is dope suga
A SUPERSTAR?? LMFAO GTFOH... HIS FANS ARE A BUNCH OF 6-12 YR OLD KIDS!! IF I PAID 50 BUCKS FOR THAT SHIT ID OF BEEN PIST! THE LIP SINKING WAS TRASH AND THE ASKREN FIGHT LOOKED LIKE A SET UP! THE EVENT WAS TRASH GOOD THING YOUR WERE F**KED UP!! 😂😂💯💯💯
I completely agree. Many of us MMA vets wanted Ben to win just because of Jake's history. But the facts are: Jake is a "natural" striker who's been training hard for 3 years. While Ben is an incredibly talented and accomplished athlete, he is in no way a natural striker. Jake's also bigger. As much as I wanted to see Ben win, he is just way too stiff when it comes to striking and Jake's been taking it seriously for years. The other part is I don't think Ben really has a passion or love for striking. If he did, with a couple months more training I think he'd take it. He just doesn't really care about striking and that makes it very difficult to learn quickly. But props to Ben for stepping up and doing his best. He stepped up and lost, that's perfectly fine and it irritates me to see all of the shit people are saying about him.
Problem is he legit thinks hes ready for that next level
Such a legit way to look at all of this 🤘 big fan of suga
:)
That event was ass
What a homie
Clay collard 's a good fight I think. Jake would be significantly bigger but Clay's a gangster.
The triller event was shitty in all aspects. Feel bad for people who paid.
Lol that shit was staged as fuck.
get yo dad askren some asprin from the store
I think Jake Paul should either fight Dillion Danis or an up and coming boxer with a similar record as him.
If Jake Paul ie real he  needs to fight a Pro Boxer same size n weight .... 6'1 ... 200 pounds ... with a record of 3 and 0 ... But he aint got the Balls .... just like Dope head freak man boy O Mally who just fought a guy 4 inch shorter than him ..... Rat Snake's feel no shame
Jake just started an independent fighter industry and not everyone knows about it yet 🤫 everyone better hop on the wagon
You have to recognized it was rigged. It could still have been entertaining, but you can't deny that was thrown/rigged.
I think Jake vs Diaz makes the most sense if not have him fight ksi and it’s the end of the YouTube boxing era
He needs to fight an ACTUAL boxer .. until then hes not that good imo 😂😂
Or like Michael Buffer said Ben Askewn lmao 😂😂
Love you SUGA
I would love to see Jake and Nate,I would buy that fight.
hair is swagtastic! i used to hate on jake but seeing all the haters losing their shit now makes me like him. he's growing up and found a passion and is putting his BS&T into it. respect!
I don't think it's a huge win for Jake but I think he's a good boxer and a true test would be a real boxer or fighter that's in both worlds not a wrestler or retired fighter
Great video bro. Blessings to you and your daughter.. I just had my first son :)life is good... keep kickin ass
I felt ben was paid to loose just like every other fight
O Mally the same kid of Idiot as Jake Paul
Your the shit man, never fails to impress with how chill and humble you are!
Jake proved he’s a good fighter but he has also proved in the past that he’s a prick. As Pete Davidson said last night the dude should be in prison
Ben needs a aspirin 😂😂😂😭
1:27  She scared the shit out of me, idk why😭😭😂😂😂😂
Tbh Suga fit right on in with all those celebrities lol all these people hate the Paul’s and in reality theyre enjoyable marketable businessmen. we need to get Sean on impaulsive!
I'd like to see Jake step and challenge a Rapper.  Which one should it be?
He can make money with these fights but has no respect because you don't get better unless you fight pro boxers!
Lands 1 punch = can box
dont forget ben got a cool MILL.. 500k a minute .
And you were there best dressed, with crazy ass celebrities, ha. Your a winner everywhere u go. Its cool to see. Just a kid from montana, insane to see. Can't wait for my undefeated outfit to get here! Let's go! 👊 I'd love to hear your thoughts and picks on UFC 261. The 3 title fights with 15,000 fans finally able to be in attendance, fucking exciting! 🙌
love jake paul
Tyron woolly vs paul, .......Tyrone will mop the floor with this punk
I’m not saying he should fight the best guy but at least fight an amateur or someone who’s actually been boxing for a while

you know we just want to hear about the parties right
The moment a real fighter calls jake out he will run for the hills.
If he want to fight he has to fight a boxer doesn't matter if hes that good   a boxer
totally agree with ya man
dope to hear your input suga show
Ufc fight night was better
Sunday Suga Show!!!
I was watching UFC instead 😂🤣🤪
I'm no hater of Jake and really respects his passion for boxing BUT he needs to chill out with his ego. I feel like it all gets to his head 😪
theres a super fight for you...🤣
id love to see you smoke that fake smalls
Nice spot man. Who beat you in chess homie?
Nay. He needs to fight white cholcate.
He got paid home boy!!
I was taking the trash out listening to this and your cat scared tf outta me. Literally thought a crazed cat was going attack me.
Did Nate Robinson last longer than Ben?
Jake Paul vs Anderson Silva. Book it.
Ben would rag doll you both in a real fight.  Remember that
Member that time chito Vera beat the fuck outta you?
The fight was rigged
Jake paul is a bum spoiled rich boy.  Who hasnt faught anyone.   Pathetic
Dope
Ben was to Jake Paul like the Washington Generals were to the Harlem Globetrotters. Paid help.
Sean would destroy even at his weight
I love how everyone is like “fight a real boxer” but like you said NO pro boxer fights killers right away lmao
No matter what you think of Jake Paul as a person he clearly has some talent for boxing and he improves with every fight which shows hes putting in the work.....plus everyone is talking about him and hes getting the bag so hes winning right now
Sean when do you fight again? Can’t wait, but have to lol.
Sean Omalley scared of Jake.. hahah so true, what a skinny fragile poser irishman.
An amazing event. I respect you so much suga but that shit was trash. How high are you.
I mean. If he’s talking shit like that. He needs to fight someone that’s the real deal
The event was trash obv you got paid by thriller to go to it but stfu saying it was great
He looks good in the ring but he hasn't fought a real boxer but when he does ill say he good
im in arizona suga nothing going for me let me work for you
Your guard vs Chito tho
You a boxer?
That shit wasn’t an amazing event 😂
"There was girls twerking.. it was crazy"😂
my boy was turnin up with the pauls last night
If Jake's a "badass"????..then wrestle Askren
Omally speakin facts though frfr
Rather have you blow up and replace Connor lol! Poriers one of my favorite fighters, I know him from here locally! The fact Connor questioned his charity was disrespectful, they literally have videos of them spending the money on projects and Khabib went with Dustin to install the water supplies. That was just Connor hyping the fight, Dustin's charity spending is actually public record, someone posted it and showed that they don't even pay their own workers, funds go straight to projects and volunteers help.
All the folks with 0-3 years fresh out of their parents house, and zero experience in a boxing gym, seem to think the fight was rigged.
Diggin the new hair sean
I bet he is hangover
Askren was an embarrassment. He did not look like he  put in any effort, in training or the fight.
Jake did good but I was confused on why the ref didn't let Ben continue
Yo Suga if you actually read comments drop a reply
i didnt even watch it and i feel robbed
Sean is going to put on 50 pounds and do this! #OnePunch
I love you big dawg my favorite fighter and just chill ass dude I’m trynna meet you one day and smoke a blunt w you 💯💯
You’re right though, easy payday for both parties. On the other hand, how about that Whittaker and Gastelum fight? Whittaker was lights out!
Captain berry crunch should sponsor you.
Thoughts on people saying the fight is rigged/fixed? Personally i think Jake just fucked em up with a 1-2 and it was a good stoppage by ref. Ben wouldve just got unnecessary punishment
🔥🔥
Fight him so I can hear Snoop yell O’MALLEY again when you sleep him
Keyboard warriors can't understand how with training and dedication you can achieve your goals... this is what's happening with jake Paul, no matter how annoying or cringe he is you have to respect his desire to win
watermelon sour patch hair...Nicee
I watch the fight illegally but I still want my refund.
Jake isnt really calling out people like diaz and woodley. He knows damn well he isnt ready for that yet. He is gonna slowly keep increasing his competition level, while he keeps training and getting better. Eventually he will fight connor or mayweather, and will be the biggest ppv ever. Him and his team are gonna keep building the hype before a huge fight. And if he beats one of those two guys, we we will 100% know for sure it is fixed.
I've never hated someone more than Paul Jake
I know I wasn’t the only one who was super happy to see Sean with all the stars! My boy sugaaaaa 😭
Amazing event? Lol Thrillas production was almost embarrassing as the fight. The commentating was awful. The whole thing was a joke...
NOOOOO SEAN!!!! PLS DO NOT ROOT FOR JAKE PAUL!!!! I LIKE YOU!!!!!
jake paul a clown bro come on
Let's be honest, all the music and shit sucked. We don't have to act like we liked it.
Ben didn't dispute the knock out because he didn't want to be in the ring anymore.
First and 0
Imagine hating on Jake, couldn’t be me.
You're a great dad. ✌ and ❤
And dana white loses a million...
Awesome video suga!!!
I dig the hair, Suga!
I agree the event was 🔥. De La Hoya getting stoned was hilarious as shit and music was good
But never underestimate your opponent.
I want to see Jake fight a good boxer on his level.
I want to see him fight Tyson Fury. But I know he would kill Jake.
I trust you Suga, ok look was it really a KO? You were there.
Sean I’m a huge fan. You know This was a damn joke man cmon.You know damn well Diaz, Woodley, YOU would catch the shit outta him and fast. You know almost anyone in the UFC would hurt him and bad.
He stay calling out the oldest dudes in the sport 😆
Jake Paul does not need a money fight! It’s red panty night for whoever fights him.
That fight was an absolute work by the way. Askren took the half milly fall. Ref and everyone were in on it.
Tyron Woodley next don’t think UFC resigns him.
Love you Sean! My nephew Anthony thinks you're the best coach. Much respect.
Yo Sean, Any news from Dom?
What up Sean
That fight was the biggest shit show this year by far and away. Oscar's nostrils was the doing the most work on that night.
Triller through a garbage event. It was freaking rigged.
I want jake Paul to go to MMA.
Idfk what happened lol I feel asleep at 12:00 when the Spanish music came on
I didn't even pay for it and I feel robbed.
I think it was aid. Askren said hes fine. Referee says no you're not. But you was there lets see what you say.
SUGAR NOTIFCATION SQUAD!!!!!!!!
Sean your a true legend man!!!💯👊
Love you bro ❤
you’re a fucking undefeated legend bro
One word rigged
The king
Suga v. Jake?
Sugashow💯💯
Lmaoo “Ben needs and aspiran.” That’s a new one
Whasup
Was waiting to hear about this from you 👌🏼
hey sean
First one here
