I miss Christian
I think you can't imagine how much I enjoyed watching the video, and sharing that minimal experience, That for some of us is a life dream.
he is driving sergio car
David Coulthard was driving redbulls old bolid in Wrocław
DC is a freaking legend, without him Red Bull would not be where they are today. He sacrificed the last of his best years for this team.
0:49 That one aged well :D
Vettel please
In my opinion David,s helmet design is the most beautiful, still to this day ❤
DC the best commantator  on F1 , not the to much babbling of Frere Jacques , and mini me Brundle , they are killing the sport , viva DC
Video idea: "YouTuber Drives The Most Dominant F1 Car For The First Time"
This idiot saying how easy it is to drive.. yet everyone can see it’s not. Meaning that he was slow
Well, the MCL39 edges it because it's a car that both drivers can excel in this on the other hand was built for Max. Great car though
Go to hit the like button, realize I've been here before.
To know that a man that is from where I am that drove for my favourite team is crazy
Loved David when he was racing , and loved the time of V10 and before the V12 , those were beasts and worth watching every time!
One of? Don’t you mean THE most dominant F1 car ever made
I want to see David Coulthard hammer a can of Red Bull.
So what DC is basically saying is that the car is way easier to drive than the cars from his era.  We all knew that.
The car that got Max his massive following during lockdown
In the words of Bernie - Don't fuck it up - well you kinda did didn't you christian?
y'all need to make another rocketship like this man
Turns out that DC cursed Lawson, because he did,  in fact, f*ck it up.
Imagine Ayrton Senna driving this car in older age ...
the W11 would say to argue
4:25 it's the same width as the cars dc drove to the cm up until. 98
Was the car that dominant? Or was it Verstappen? Perez barely took second in the championship.
Yes DC , you could have won the title  !! 😀
i want to see Helmut show us how its done
I'd love to see someone like DC given more time in a modern car as a scientific test to see how close he could get to the younger drivers. I don't reckon he'd be far off at all.
I wonder if F1 teams are mandated to have a new car every season, or is it some rule change? The RB19 seems to be better than the RB21.
Sounds like a Dyson. Too big, too complex and the engines sound terrible.
Last words to Liam.  Dont fuck it up 😁
Its not one the most dominant. Its THE MOST DOMINANT F1 CAR OF ALL TIME
might be quick but sounds like shit
The last comment to Liam didn't age well.
They should put him in car next to Max...
I like DC so much !!!!! too many memories...... !
Huge car and sounds bad
6:20: DC to LAW, 'As a racing driver to another, don't f*ck it up''. Well....LAW did not take note of that advice it seems...
the v6 sounds cool when he is driving. he is defenitly reving it much higher at times. not the v10 but still cool
......pity onboard F1 microphone technology is still stuck in the 90s.....
Ya me dio ambre🥩©️🌮🌭🍔🥙🥪🍻🧆🍜🍙🚓🍲🍙🥡🍕🥘🍘🥞
And the next day they  looked at Lawson ..🙄
0:51 this aged well
WHAT WAS DC'S LAP TIME????
what was dc his laptime?
Wow! That old DC can still drive! Must be nostalgia.
Now make David teach Liam some tricks for his first year in f1 (as a full time driver/first team)
Man drives better that Stroll lmao
Dc kept himself in shape.
DC you will never be forgiven for the lies in the Senna trial.
NASCAR <_> a small order of FRIES
The RB7 you drive usually is far better
David Coulthard - legendary talent, brilliant driver, consummate sportsman.  Great to see him in the RB-19.    I really miss his calling F1 races.  His witty, inciteful commentary and intimate knowledge of how the cars work made  watching F1 races feel like having an excellent meal.  Sky Sports leaves much to  be desired.
to be in the 50's and still have a fit body is something tho
I hope to befriend someone in the f1 world someday that can get me into an old f1 car.  I’d love to be able to experience that
he was unusually tall for a driver no?
Would love to see you get Kyle Larson in one
Petition to let DC drive every RBs as long as he's able to drive one!
Honda has now claimed credit for the top 2 dominant race cars in F1 history.
Wouldn't it be great if former drivers from other teams drove their old cars and the new ones as well. Maybe McLaren and Ferrari drivers from the past?
1:56 he sounded so sad saying this lol
all fun and games until u realise the f1 champion when rb1 was released is still one of the best drivers on the grid..
Beautiful t cam. not dis zoomed crap from fom
Red bull , been caught cheating twice. Tech has moved on , attitudes haven't.
RB1 that was a F1 best sound
It is the most dominant car in f1 yet
The most successful f1 car was the mercades w11
I love DC's commentary, makes you engaged in the video and he's doing it while driving
I feel like F1 is messing with the sound in the broadcast (they do have the power to do so). This same car sounds quite a bit different (even in the pit lane) during a Grand Prix transmission I think. Gods the V10 were amazing
David has to be the luckiest f1 driver. He has the opportunity to ride f1 cars even when hes no longer in the grid. Other drivers when they retire or get replaced find it hard to fill the adrenaline and rush of F1 and look for ways to fill that hole, sure there may be other former drivers that get reunited with F1 but the amount david gets it is what makes him lucky great job redbull
Now give us his times..
once a racing driver, always a racing driver
Well Done.  Thank you 😊
I only wish! ... that Michael could experience this... SAD
Looks down tuned
DC, still a cool guy
You knew if he it were for him he would have driven for an hour or two to extract all the pace he can.
This is fantastic!!
DC keeping himself in shape even after all these years. Fairplay
What a Lie Its Not Better Than That W11
If I were FIA I would think a bit letting older drivers race alongside young ones MrCulthard has just demonstrated  As for DC man go assist at McLaren
They laughed now and they laughed then. I support DC and do certainly believe he could have been champion in RB19 in his prime. They also laughed when he predicted Vettel and Red Bulls championships 2010. He's a driver he knows what he talks about 👍
Always great to see DC in the car :)
Now throw him in an Alpine
Да еп та😂😅
Poor coulthard, he only frove an out lap, a full lap and an in lap
Still drives better than lance
Not true it's the most successful F1 car of all time. It's not a like for like comparison. The McLaren MP4/4 won 15 of 16 races in 1988.
Very wonderful commentary from INSIDE the cockpit!
If he drove RB1 after that...old car would stole the show.
Please make Sebastian Vettel drive it.
These cars sound absolutely crap
Plees drive in full speed
F1 cars should not be 'super easy to drive' as Liam Lawson said. They need to be untamed animals like the V10 and V8 eras were. I pray that the 2026 cars bring back something missing, both in driver challenge and engine sound.
I wonder if these older f1 drivers could throw down a competitive lap in these newer cars ?
Simply lovely to see cristian smiling and enjoying his work in the video even though he had all the drama ongoing at the time of filming
v10 only!!!
The SUV formula 1 car.
0:10 so the texts were to DC this whole time? he was begging for it
wasnt exactly thrashing the nuts off it was he
I would  love to see Vettel Drive that thing.
So good to see him get a chance to drive the new car. He is an awesome racer.....Take care, Bluefin.
You were good indeed, David! Hats off!
Can't David succeed Horner? Gentleman at its best, greetings from the Netherlands.....
Never ever did I hear somebody talk this mutch while driving.....  A lady couldt do it better liker this!!
Always loved David's driving.
Love it more please
Wish this team is dismantled soon. They have won on favourable and biased conditions always
always love DC and so glad he is still in F1, especially commentary.
hmm Horner should replace Max with DC... biggest difference? No BS drama with DC in the driver's seat.
i have got a feeling this years machine is going to be even more dominant than this one.. as hard as it might feel to imagine that.. we will see how 2024 unfolds for Red Bull..
Would be nice to know his lap time, because he is an excellent river, but without experience with this RB19 with newer technology, and see what the lap time of the RB19 drivers had been on this circuit.
I loved the way DC described driving the RB19. Absolutely phenomenal! Felt as if I was there in the cockpit instead of him. He really put into perspective the amount of effort that goes into building these cars that are practically spaceships. Legend!
What does he mean he doesn't need to use the throttle when leaving the garage?
Epic
DC always number 2 driver bless him.
Wish you would run Hill sometime or vs culthard
Bring back the V10s!
Great to watch. Only thing that would be better is Mark Webber too. DC and MW were always great doing this stuff.
Now the second most dominant. RB20 😅
Come on red bull , let’s invite some current players to have a go, I’d love to see if any can come close to maxs’ time, I doubt they could .
Very entertaining , you’ve still got it David. 😊👍
I cant look at Horner the same 😂
Sick to see Liam in the black redbull fit.
David is such a nice person....i miss his racing years
Id love if Redbull timed lap old drivers vs Max Verstappen.
It would be nice to see your lap time against Max Verstappen time on the same car.
Sorry David but I think you have forgotten you also have driven the Williams FW36 😅: https://youtu.be/iLJVtDzjJ10?si=bBGHlCSs4AchCp_u
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Please Vettel
We need an over 50y/o ex formula 1 driver race. PLEASSEEEE
I do miss seeing that helmet on the grid.
David Coulthard looks amazing with his white hairs, and drives like a beast, give him more laps to drive and he will demolish those youngsters ;)   amazing content! @Oracle Red Bull Racing
Christian Horner's a funny guy
DC is the OG Red Bull guy
This is SO nice, please more of this! :)
you have to let other RB drivers try it they won't crash it DW
hey kid did you know who you talking to, David Coulthard he's a legend you should ask hm for some advice.
Not sure why they laughed anyone could win the championship in that car
It's much nicer to listen to in this video compared to live coverage. That Honda ICE purrs.... It looks lovely through the high speed stuff.  What a car.
David Coulthard-to-get rid of.
The best car ever made, undoubtedly, no questions asked ❤
Horner was busy doing other things.
There is no other sport in the world where it is known in advance who will win. F1 has become incredibly boring. 99% is the car and only 1% is the driver.
good job David
curious if he actually tried to do an actual lap and his lap times compared to liam's.
and was faster than Perez
DC had a lot of fun in that RB.  He was an awesome driver back in the day.
Sera muy difocil superar ese coche a puesto el liston tan alto que sera dificil hasta para el nuevo RB 20 pero yo tengo fe en que por lo menos lo iguale aumque todo es posible segun es mucho mas  rapido y mas potente el motor Honda asi que plena Fe con vestappen
you should go back think about it there is a steering wheel in mercedes
RB created perfection.
Most overrated driver ever.
Its not Max's RB19....  That was the most dominant car of all time.
Im sure he is better and faster than perez
01:28 these are RuPauls words. Just saying. :D
sounds amazing damn i missed f1
Can we get this or one of Redbull other championship winning F1 cars demonstrate up Goodwood FOS Hill this year ?
What is it with people not saying "the" before things that should have a "the" preceding them.  It should be "THE RB19".  I hear the same with more and more other subjects.  It's like people are trying to be pretentious or different somehow.  It's pathetic
idk if i hard a v6 or v8
Masterpiece Newey respect guys 🙏💪
Bet if Lewis is watching, he is phoning toto.. it's so not right toto..
wanna also see seb vettel in that RB19, the max verstappen of ~2010
Nothing good about a hybrid v6 you can't beat the 3ltr v10
LOL they just had to make that that reserve driver for next year when DC said "You know we are in competition for the drive in this car for the next year" You guys aint fooling nobody Welcome Liam, byebye Checo!
I’d love to see SEB driving it!! ❤
Hybrid is a gimmick.
🥸🥸🥸🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hate Red Bull Love DC Simple As
Liam deserves a drive
did not say honda engine   seem he does not like honda  lucke to get a drive
I wish one day, there could be a special episode, where Max will try Hamiltons 21 car and vice versa.
Some years ago somewhere: how much money we can give to Adrian? Answer: How much cost you a second per lap at circuit? Hire an  Adrian   is the best thing which red bull did.
Love this video and love the relationship and atmosphere with DC and RB.
There is absolutely no reason these need to run on a V6 instead of a V8. By the logic of turning F1 into a demonstration of energy efficiency they would be way better off engineering the ultimate i4 engine instead of a V6, but here we are with cars that sound terrible and still aren't as efficient as the best compact engines.
What a nice video, DC is so humble 🫶🏼
What an outstanding video, thank you.  Happy New Year to all.
1000hp machine and why its looks so slooow at 60% corners
This is the most awesome thing ever
The old boy still has it.
DC's driving the rb19 coz he catched the two balls. 🤭
They should have got him in the RB1 first for a comparison.
Honda powaaaa 🔥
Just love DC, ultimate RBR and simular as Max is. Full on speed. Marvelous!!!!!!!!!! Tnx DC, tnx RBR, epic!
they gave him the biggest wing i've ever seen on that car 😂
#Vettel
Fuck DC!
@David Coulthart what was your lap time?
I was enjoying watching this video, but sadly I had to stop due to the blasphemy...  😓😓
i love that DC keeps himself absolutely 100% ready to hop in to a modern F1 car at a moments notice. Big respect
His time is better than Checo's, right?
Its scary to see that DC is starting to look a LOT older than his age. Time does fly Alonso is already in his 40's, soon it will be Hamilton and soon both have to RETIRE from the sport
what was DCs lap time? Asking for a friend called Seb :)
Did anyone else get emotional when all you could see was DC's eyes from the helmet? YES! DC IS THE GOAT!!!
30+ seconds?
get vettel in there
Very, very cool!
This is great. Could tell he think's its way more pussy than pure racing cars. Wide and fat with plenty of electronic aids but an easy access to the power.  Good on ya Stig
next VETTEL 😁 please
Kimi next please
Dc is a legend 😂
This is the greatest Formula One car ever, and I'm glad David Coulthard got to drive it. Nice!!!!
DC vs Guy Martin was a good watch too
His forever home😊🎉😅😅
Subtitles please next time
This car doesn't get the credit it deserves, Probably no other car in the next 100 will come close to its on track success.
They should have let David open up the DRS and really unleash the RB19.
David could win the Championship in this car, what a Rocket ship. Adrian Newey, what a machine!
The ageism jokes in this segment are pretty crude. We will all succumb to the effects of time and should be thankful for every trip around the sun.
I have to have disagree with Coulthard saying the RB19 was "one of the best F1 cars he ever drove," no; it its the greatest F1 car ever made. Full stop. Period.
Max would not have had such an easy season if DC was his teammate that's for sure.
One of? Why down play it. It’s the most dominant F1 car ever…
You spelled "the most dominant" wrong
Alright Red Bull, please please please get Sebastian Vettel to drive the RB 19 next.
The smile on his face says everything.
They didn’t gave you a lot one lap
May I be next,pleaaaaase😂😂😢
the car is that succesfful because of max
This is awesome. So glad DC drove this!
I allways liked this guy
This steering wheel dosen't play as much as the one in the Williams fw16...right David?
Thank you RB and DC, that was excellent ;)
How freaking cool was that? Coulthard is a classic Scott with dry humourand lightheartedness. At 52 years old  he gave us a reference to some degree of what it would be light as a mere mortal to drive that car. Christian Horner is a total classic also as was Liam. Cheers!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣I used to be good
DC what a class 💪
What did you say about Kimi? You said retire, you should take your own advice.
Kalle rovanperä next pls😊
Its so wholesome to see DC and Liam together in the RB-19! Congrats Bulls!
Max 🐐
He sat next to the mecanic  'Elivis' Priestly at lunch on Priestlys first day and had a great chat with him! When he expressed his surprise, David explained that he relied on everyone in the team, so he needed to get to know everyone
Best car ever
Wholesome
This is why I don't like seeing DC as an F1TV pundit.
One of the most?… its literally the most dominant car, great car but unfortunately the worst year of f1 racing I’ve ever seen.
How on earth they were allowed to film this under current testing restrictions regulations?
Such a class act, mr Coulthard!
Great watch DC.  The question is, could a current driver who relies so massively on driver aids have won a title driving a car from your era???
DC is so tall compared to today's racers - and what a lovely guy this is!
Title tu bh..mcm sial🤣🤣🤣
Que agradable saber que existen deportistas como David Coulhart que a pesar de la edad mantienen una forma física impresionante. Parece fácil, pero poder montar un F1 a su edad no es lo más sencillo. Mi respeto para este gran campeón, disfrute mucho el vídeo.
At least they recognize what we all been saying the whole time: it's mainly the car.
15 years in F1 with 13 wins, 62 podiums and 12 poles. Yup, he's qualified to do a few laps in RB19!
I have not enjoyed F1 for many years. Better to watch MotoGP.
arguably? this piece of machinery in combination with max verstappen has broken the most records ever and has the highest win percentage in f1 history.
David !
Vomit TV. built by over spending total Red Bile
DC has always been a great character. I enjoy his enthusiasm.
Would have been nice if they could have given him 10 laps, just so he could get his eye in properly, 1 lap for even an expert of their trade isn't much to realise even near the potential, super cool to see him drive it tho for sure :)
DC is such a legend, love to see him!
I have to commend DC. Still being able to drive these F1 cars, 15 years after the end of his 14 year F1 career.
I think it's an honor for red bull to get DC back in the car
So was that the fastest lap you’ve ever done at silverstone?
Maybe not the best driver but certainly one of the most easygoing and coolest guys ever. By the way, did I hear that correct 5:55?
DC is such a sycophant for the cheating RedBull.
Plus a legends probs last lap
How do I get to host RB YouTube channel? Not that many channel got a dominant F1 car in their garage for a test drive. You are one lucky host David! ❤❤
The fact his commentary notes "so precise" so many times.
Didn't know it was allowed...to drive a car from last season, while the rules have hardly changed.
Car that became perfection under Max Verstappen…..
DC driving Miss Daisy around Silverstone. Would have been great to see him give it the beans!
No vettal he's a climate mental case
David, you are an honest man. If I had this car, and I got the radio call to “Box, Box.. pit.” Oh man, I’d be looking for the track access road and they’d never see me again.
Adrian Newey should be designing spaceships and they somehow have him designing F1 cars. That's probably why it's so good.
DC - you still are good 😊🎉
We knew it was the car even if Hamilton is better they won’t say it just to lick ass and drive the car
How did Liam do?
loved this and nice to see the interaction with Liam, your a gentleman David and not a bad peddler either.
To pose a threat to Mika you definitely had to be good. You're a legend DC, it was a pleasure to see you drive. Despite constant jump cuts.
Its not one of the most dominant F1 cars         It is the most dominant F1 Car
I like dave
Well done David.  I doubt a professional f1 driver never ever really has lost it . Takes us back to when it was more competitive
So, DC, says it’s the most successful GP car in to ever have raced. Then Liam Lawson, explains just how remarkably easy the car is to drive … Wow! Isn’t Max just the best 😂😂😂
Really nice to see DC in a car again 👏👏👏👏
Lucky Lucky guy
Give Hamilton ago just to stir things up. 😂
Some people say he's out there still running on adrenaline and haggis gas.
DC deserved that.
You were a very good driver David, good to see you driving again.
This car is a snore compared to what David drove in the day.
Weird, Red Bull actually paid Christian Horner to come from Netflix to be present on this video! 🤪
Honda has it wrapped up
We need to have DC try and push the RB1 and RB19 and see how much of a gap there is!
It's not even a great car to drive I mean look at checho
Why he's running so slow?
So I guess DC finally got his Wiings 😂
You need to cum back to f1 DC... To see if you can get a championship!!
David Coulthard is absolutely legendary in the history of formula 1 racing with 13 Grand Prix victories and 62 podium finishes. 👏👏👏
Such a treat for us to be taken around a lap in the RB19 by the legend that is DC! Thank you. 🙏🏽😊
Love watching DC have a go in a RB and not just be blinded by stupid bias because of where he was born.
This is just absolute madness. Thanks  for this legendary video Redbull!
Replace Perez with the kiwi !
https://youtu.be/-xro2lhmmXQ?si=T4RNWiGHMBcEy8Sy
Great driver but couldn't handle pressure
D.C. is still my favourite F1 driver that never won a world championship! Thanks D.C. for all the fun and enjoyment you have afforded us with your career both on the track and commentating about it!
Everyone loves David Coulthard
DC is right, so much power and so much downforce, he might be the WC with this car....
Love this DC!!!
lap time? haha
Smooth equals slow. Got it.
Dc could probably still beat perez😂😂
Dang, just three laps? That must have been amazing. What a scorcher.
He did use to be good.
Love seeing DC get to drive it. Vettel next?
Great seeing DC in a car again. Would love it if he could get in a full day's test.  One can only imagine how things might be if they'd had him in a car that reliable (the one Max drove anyay) and consistently quick back in the day.  Honestly I wouldn't hesitate to put him  in that car today.
Scotland's answer to Ireland's Eddie Ivvine driving the number one car in formula one.lol❤Slainte David,  you can go faster. Slainte 😅❤
just shxt up
Its awesome watching legends drive new cars. David is very handsome, same with Michael.
Glad they got David to drive again. Wonder who's next on the list?
a thing that i find pretty funny is the fact that dc revs the hybrid engine quite high (in the beginning) because thats what he is used to
I love how when drivers are told to box they always sound sad like a kid that's told the ride is over.
All that tech and they use a 5 quid mic
This is amazing
All that technology, yet they still can't get a proper working microphone
People forget how great a driver DC was...At a competitive time for the sport, he had his fair share of wins and only  narrowly missing out on the title
El R v20 más poderoso
Cuando cambien de motor asta y llegaron
Oh god DC was so annoying as a driver. Love him since he stopped though and great to set him back behind the wheel.
David Coulthard is an amazing driver and a formidable person! I met him in Jeddah in 2021, i shouted « David!! » and the guy just casually turned, said hi and engaged in a casual conversation with me! I told him how big of a fan of his i was since his Mclaren days, and his humbleness is indescribable.. He gave me 10min of his time chatting about F1 like he was a simple fan like i was, he even proposed to resume the chat afterwards in the paddock after his press conference with the top 3 drivers of the Q3!! Top lad, an example of a true gentleman, and especially a true F1 fan.. Thank you David, will never forgive that! Cheers
Sergio Perez from the 90s LMFAO
I feel like DC acquitted himself well.
Well done DC you’ve still got it 😂
Dam I love that Red Bull does stuff like this. So cool
Names every part of the track, bar the Hamilton straight 😂 RedBull for you
Missed the sound of engine 😢❤
What was his best laptime? Just for reference...
Just ashame you've now got a fake 3x world champion!😢
Aaaah the good old formula 1 days :) Greetz from Holland!
I think DC was right. Anyone but Perez could've won in that car
Vettel could win a title in that car, against Max.
How cool is that
love liam honesty "its easy to drive" while they tell us always how hard it is to drive a modern f1 car ^^
What a machine
We need a seniors paddock.
Im glad 'gp2 engine' were not the final words in Hondas f1 history.
For the love of Christ get Vettel in the seat please.
So smuuth!
Fantastic 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
He should drive the W11, fastest ever f1 car
Seeing that helmet with the Scottish flag on track man....that brought back so many 2000s memories man!!  "I knew I had one last good lap on me" that hit hard! Loved to see this!! Imagine Alonso, Lewis, Vettel, Schumacher or Senna in this car??? I can only dream!! 🥰
They should invite Lewis 😅😅
Would love to see this back to back with RB1
Now put Max in rb1 😂
Not a Max fan, but I think Max is more dominant than RB is.
Don't watch F1 anymore but nice to see DC driving again, didn't know the cars have 1,000 bhp, guess they're heavier now though, anyway interesting viewing.
I'm not sure when this was filmed but we've not had sun and cloudless skies in Northampton for 2 months lol
Could you imagine the insane publicity you would get if you let D.C come back for 1 race??!!!
Beware the ANZACs 2024. 💪
The older you get, the faster you was...  Thank you for that great piece of humour DC
Fact: Coultard could come out of retirement and win a DWC with that car. Damon Hill could come out of retirement and win a DWC in that car. Christian Horner himself could win a DWC in that car. A talentless idiot with a banger racer mentality who says get out my way or we crash can win a DWC in that car. Max is NOTHING, that car is EVERYTHING.
mp4-4 did it first and better
30 years for those taller than 1.70m it was difficult to be a pilot
Bravo, David!!
DC was, is and will be a legend.....    Btw why only one lap ... Might have given at least 5 or 6
Great video!  Well done, DC!
For anyone who doesn't know. Red Bull has changed the world of sports for the better. From some of the sports most of the planet didn't even know existed, to the most prestigious stage with F1.Many athletes wouldn't have a career without Red Bull. I have never had a favorite driver or athlete in any sport but watch all i can because I love competition.I like knowing the overpriced beverage I'm buying actually helps the athletes and their respected sport.
He could probably still beat Checo!
His helmet...so iconic! One helmet: stop.
As a child growing up, Ferrari and McLaren were my two favorite teams, so I remember well DC, Mika, and Kimi racing against Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello. It's really nice to see DC still having a chance to drive these cars.  Also, the RB19 is not just "one of the most dominant F1 cars"; it is THE most dominant F1 car, breaking the McLaren MP4/4's 35-year record (95.45% races won to 93.75% for the MP4/4).
if an old goat like dc can manhandle this machine easily max aint that special
Simping for a car with no competition aint it 🥱
I'll always love DC. What a great character
Great to see the saltire back where it belongs 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Bro f1 should make veteran league.. Gives them maybe f3 car with 5-6 rounds pairing with non sprint weekend.. It be lit.. 🔥🔥🔥 It will better than women league ahaha
the best car in history.
You know what DC stands for??
This guy here was testing CVT williams FW15C. I am pretty sure that car would be the most dominant from all times even today.
Thank you David, an elegant drive!  Makes me think, if this oldest generation of current F1 drivers (Lewis and Fernando) want to keep racing the next 10 years, they can probably be competitive doing so and they will have no trouble finding a team.  It is not like traditional sports where the likelihood of injury is greater, it’s more about loosing your edge, but these guys seem to have a recipe that works to keep that edge honed.
He sounded disappointed when he said "the power of a v6 turbo hybrid behind me"
Big congrats to red bull and max cheatstappen on taking 3 fake world championships, and a even bigger congrats to David Coulthard for becoming a mouth peace for red bull, also a big hello to the racist HELLmut marko
"I used to be good!"  Hahahaha!  That was so much fun to watch, and DC did a great job in the RB19 for a man of many years.  Mere mortals wouldn't have had a chance, and he's still got it.  I always wish he could have won a WDC, but glad we still get to enjoy his commentary and wit.
RB19, W11, F2004, FW14, MP4/4. The greatest modern F1 machines made by the hand of man.
I'd be like "Mother f**ker, you wrecked in the pit wall once!" Ha ha. Good show.
what ever has happened to Ferrari
Any laptimes?
DC is older than Max's father so I guess geriatric is a fair joke.....sadly, I'm older than DC....
Sorry, aber das ist doch kein Test? Er fährt weder die volle Leistung noch fährt er wirklich schnell? Wie will man da herausfinden, was das Auto wirklich kann?
He was revving the shit out of that haha
That’s DC reward for been RB lap dog for the year… all worth it I guess…
"it feels nimble to me" as he drives like a grandma coming home from church on sunday
I Think Red Bull Have Found A New Driver For Next Year🤣🤣🤣
Amazing cars no denying that but they all sound shit.
Arguably? Cmon! You cant be serious! (Obviously red bull contract talk) 1988 mclaren was ssssoooo dominant. Look how many seconds they were ahead in qualifying at monaco than the feild...not tenths...SECONDS nothing came close to winning except senna crashing out at monza they had pole every single race. Often there fastest race laps were faster than the rest of the feilds qualifying laps (and the whole field had qualifying tyres that were so much grippier than race tyres they were only good for 3-4 laps   Even Berger at Adelaide leading early was nothing more than he had the boost turned up to max and was going to run out of fuel before 3/4 way through the race and by the time arnoux took him out at fosters hairpin, prost who always slowly settled into a race building speed as he went was closing. And knowing the performance of the mclaren Berger probably wouldnt even have even been leading by the time his car ran out of fuel.
LOVED every bit!!!
Please let Seb drive this monster please 🥺🙏🏻
Love this content good to see DC getting back in the office , and good from RBull to make it happen , we need Brundle and Blundell next come on ! plus where is Johhny?
Yeah, put Lewis in there.
w11🤡🤡🤡
We need Seb in this car just 1 time please RedBull 🙏🙏
Would like to see what sort of time DC could put in after getting comfortable for 10 - 15 laps. Now let's see Seb get behind the wheel of it..
What session is this? Normally cars gotta be 2 years old to run unrestricted
DC.. The most humble and such an amazing person.. He drove it like he stole it 👌 Wonder what laptime he got?? We have to know!!! If he had just got a few moore laps. He soo deserved this champion DC!🎉
Lucky You DC !! and congratulations for the thrill ride at 53.     The "No Respect Laughs" were unacceptable.   You were racing F1 before they were born
Great to see DC in the car... I'd actually like to see Horner in it!
This video made me kind of sad, honestly. DC is an absolute treasure, what a lovely guy.
Ohhhhhhh but I thought the Mercedes was more dominant? U see that redbull fans 💀
most dominant car weve ever seen, and id bet max just cruises once ahead, he could double his lead if wanted. mclaren and williams fan boy here
DC was a top driver with some rotten mechanical luck. What the 90"s and 00's and see how many F1 cars blew up.
Wish DC could've stayed with McLaren to drive the MP4-20, but then again he wouldn'yt have been able to start the RB journey.  Great stuff.
Let Lewis drive it for a few laps 😅
I don't think it would have been the most dominant if it wasn't for Max
Most dominant does not mean the fastest.
Great job, you’re an absolute class act always
DC, still a hero! Great to see such a big smile!
I love that they keep DC around and keep him active with the team and brand.
Dat Drone though
Vettel PLEASE DRIVE ITTTT
OKAY SO NOW BRING UP DANIEL I KNOW HE TRIED IT BUT WE NEED MORE
Девід Култхард крутий!
epic 🤙🏻🤙🏻
GREAT . I always wanted DC to well in grand prix.    Glad he got a drive of this car .
holy fuck editor dont need to cut every 5 seconds its just annoying as fuck way to make a lap un watchable
RB even said themselfs the car is dominant lol
It’s also the driver like max  he is a complete master at his job. Max best driver in f1 ever. And best driver ever to sit in a g1 car next to senna
Bet the dutch are malding about this title. They all insist the car is rubbish and its only pure belgian racecraft that's causing these wins.
Vettel next please 🥹
I wonder if DC could still manage a time to qualify for a race with it 🤔
STARE F1 BYLO LEPSZE WIECEJ SIE DZIALO .DUZO BO NIEWIADOMYCH I TE TAJNE STRATEGIE... 😊😊😊
But Verstappen brings the ultimate out of it!! ..... Hee!! DC ,you still got it 😛
DC Max`s teammate confirmed?
let sebastian do some quali laps
No need to lie David, we all know they are too heavy 😅
2009年にイベントでサインをくれたDavidが今も様々な形でF1に携わり またマシンをドライブしている事が最高に嬉しい
I'd love to see the times of past Red bull drivers after giving them a day of testing 😁
great video
What did he mean by don’t need to use the throttle in the pits?
This is so cool!
RB crime did pay. Fast car.
Dc is and always will be one of my iconic drivers
Honestly DC was really good and could have been WC if it wasn't for those terrible reliability issues of McLaren.
*The most dominant f1 cars
I’m always in awe that they are able to still talk whilst testing the cars limit. Here I am doing go karts having to remind myself to catch a breath sometimes.
At the end of each season they should organize an event where each driver has to drive other teams car in a Qualifying style format, just to see if other drivers can walk the talk saying "RB just has the most dominant car", "Max and Checo aren't that good" etc or they are just all talk.
What a man!  awesome sight to see such a veteran of the sport and such an important part of the history of Red Bull Racing driving the most dominant car ever to race a full season.
Still in good shape David.  👌
DC should have Helmut's job
Whenever I see David I think of a group of F1 experts and the question: "What will be the domminant team of the year" and when it was David's turn he said: "Probably RedBull" and everybody was loughing. At the end of the season nobody was loughing anymore ;-)  Fly RedBull fly!
Thank you Oracle Red Bull Racing and David for this!  Its nice to get someone elses input on this fantastic combined effort of the most successful race car
Todo un caballero. Gracias DC
Very well deserved for DC he can replace Checo for 2024! 🤩✌️
What a gentleman DC is.
Everybody loves DC. What a lively guy.
He have to say it, but he likes to V8 and 18000 rpm
DC you are now a great entertainer!  Thank you for the inside view you make possible to all of us.
The 2020 cars were faster in general. I mean Williams 2020 must be faster than RB19, I get the hype but compared to cars over the years, it isn't the fastest by any means.
I wonder why DC chose number '37' for his number.  Was it merely because of the garage number?
Love the Camera angles/position on the car. Wish F1 had used it, instead of shoulder mounted ones.
Got toove DC
You can’t not smile at this. 2024 world champion
DC, you're always a joy to watch, your _joie de vivre_ !
LAWSON IS OUR RESERVE DRIVER
Grandpa still has thet monster neck
"This Car Generation" DC Said, well basically its build by Old dinosaur who also destroy F1 with Vettel. I love DC driving this car, never raced outside F1 like JB or Keating who 51 y/o but still he has a joy a driving like 25 y/0 while he was 52.......got emotional how this professional Grandpa driving the record breaker car, love you DC😢😢😢
Hamilton comento que a todos los pilotos les gustaria probar el RB19 ,..
DC throwing shade at Checo at the end there
Very cool. Well done DC 👌
I have no doubt that, just a few years back, DC would have indeed won the title in this car. Maybe not against Max, but certainly against quite a few other drivers.
The Chemistry & Back & forth between DC & CH never fails to make me giggle! 😂
I would love to see Michael Schumacher drive the SF23 car
Everybody liked that. Happy for you, DC. The video we didn't now we needed..
Why is RedBull just so freaking AMAZING!! You guys seriously put out the best content out of all the other teams combined. Happy to see Coulthard drive that beast!
First.. Mass respect for RBR for giving DC this unique opportunity. That shows mutual love and respect.  Second.. Mass respect for DC for still having his Superlicense and showing some smooth operating in the RB19 after a 15 year F1 retirement..
seeing that helmet inside a current red bull car feels so right
Two young drivers ❤
Wonder who will win Coulthard in RB19 or Schumacher in Ferarri F2004,that will be epic battle🙏
Very familiar sight DC behind the wheel of a F1 car. But how quick are those Old foxes still comparing the new generation?
1 lap? Are you serious? 1 lap was to get the tires and brakes warm.
Never seen Anyone take cops corner this slow 🤣
As a Scottish Kiwi, I thoroughly enjoyed that. Can't wait till Liam gets the full time drive he deserves!😊
“One of” 😂 More like “By far”. I’m so happy DC gets to have a go.
Shame your not
Thanks for the information on AI sis!
''Lightning'' holy smoke! the energy comes right out of this guy
Awesome, although part of me feels a lil bit teased as to what his lap time was. A true test of age Deg'
Cool video! DC is awesome
Awesome
I just love seeing the Scottish flag atop DC's helmet. Find memories. FREEEEEDDDDOOOOOMMMM
The people want to see: A warmup lap  A second warm up lap An absolute FULL SEND lap.  Let’s see Seb next
Just another ex-driver to water down the narrative. Who cares what he thinks. Cars and courses have changed. He doesn't automatically qualify to rate an opinion worthy of the current situation.
Incredible!!!
He had fun, you could see it when he get's ut of the car.  He's beaming with awe
He probably would have won the title in that car at 52.
Let's be honest here. Most of the downforce was generated by DC's jaw. It did hurt his straightline speed though.
2:35  Through goes Coulthard.
So what were the lap times?
Was that a subtle hint that Lawson is going to be driving the RB next year, Don't fuck it up....
rlly enjoyed this one thank u!
give us sebastian!
DC i think is reason RBR was ALWAYS gona bring Dani Ric back. Both are so charismatic great PR investments. Even if Dani Ric didnt put in a time in the rb19 that impressed Horner , theyd kept him to do DCs job smoozing Sponsors, doing events etc etc once DC retires  Also ppl said homda lost its sound off throttle. NOPE
Me: yeah, English is my first language  A scott in a helmet:
Tell that to Perez .  It takes a virtuous to extract the best from the best
As Jeremy Clarkson once said "What a machiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine".
DC is the GOAT gentleman that has ever graced the paddock. I'm glad he is still part of it.
I didn't know David Hasselhoff drives Formula 1 cars...😅
This guy may not have won a title but matters not a single yota. To me DC is one of the best sportsmen, ever.
That was excellent! DC is one of the top drivers of our times and certainly appeals to my generation more than the current young drivers. To get his opinion and see his reaction to the car means more to me than seeing Max win because I know what DC was driving in the past. If it was up to me the minimum age entry to F1 would be 30.  What a great car though. Max has talent for sure but IMO the car is the real secret to his victory. I've driven karts and learned the hard way that the man with the best equipment (and most cash) typically is the man who wins the race.
dani ric watching this
I'm surprised the car could handle that jawline. Just goes to show you how strong this car was.
why isnt the 4x wc driving the car?
Give DC another Season 👌🏻🤝🏻
Thank you for this video - I lived vicariously for 6:58 full seconds. Thank You
Still faster than Perez
Great video but wish DC could’ve pushed a little harder
Is that Traction Control at 3:45 right out of Cobbs corner? Sounds like it (just like in the F1 game), but I know F1 cars don't have TC during the race. Is it a feature they can turn on though?
It’s hard not to like DC.
omg im still such a massive DC fan
Liam saying its very easy to drive is what is missing from f1 and the reason it just doesnt feel the same as a fan
Shame for the rules, rules, rules. Would have liked to see DC get up to speed.
I love it!
DC is a cool cat, really enjoy his stuff.
Sounds like a 1.3 fiesta with a bean tin exhaust😂
DC is awesome
Lewis could win 10 championships with that car
I want to see Hinch take a few laps, get an Indy drivers perspective!
I'm amazed how he can comment on the lap while driving although hes not pushing 100% its still impressive
Vettel next, PLEASE!!!!!!!
You got feel for DC, he packed just before the car got good.
Why no throttle in the pits?
Vettel pls
DC drove so Max could...well, also drive.
Please put Seb behind that wheel 🥹 it would make the circle round again. Current RB WDC champion -> First ever RB driver to get podium -> former RB WDC champion
Love DC, he always has such a positive attitude. He needs to do more F1 commentary. Thank you to Redbull for allowing him to drive the RB19
Works for F1 TV but is still clearly in the Redbull camp which is why I hate when they have him as a broadcaster because he can't be unbiased like you can always tell no matter what he's on Redbulls side and don't say anything wrong when it comes to them if anything he tries to justify everything like several times Max when the whole pitlane drama was unfolding he was always fine when Max did it but when George did it I think in Brazil he's like oh that's a slam dunk penalty for George when Max did it already in Singapore multiple times and COTA plus in sing. Max impeded 2 drivers badly one was Tsunoda other was Piastri both instances he explained why Max shouldn't get a pen but someone else did the same and he was like slam dunk penalty if the get away with it that's just a complete miscall lol get dude out he can go kiss ass at Redbull and do stuff for them get his unbiased ass off F1 TV please!
Love you David !
Well done DC , young man 😊. You're only 52👍🏿👍🏿😁
Happiness is a bit like that, isn’t it?
Very enjoyable great to see DC out there again. I'm sure it was a thrill.
Come on David, my grandma could drive faster ...😅😅😅
ABu DHabi 2021 still has not been forgotten.
Imagine what Max will be allows to drive 15 seasons after his retirement! I bet it will be a hydrogen powered F1 car
The W11 smashes day and night this overrated.
congrats brother...
❤
It was David fucking Coulthard driving a Red Bull RB19! That's one of the most dominant F1 cars the world has ever seen in history.  #redbull #redbullracing #rb #rb19 #f1 #formula1 #givesyouwings #davidcoulthard #dc
People don't have names anymore, they are addressed by their initials. Polite, isn't it.
Liam instead of Checo, please RBR!
That look in his eyes at the end is just pure enjoyment to watch
David is such a good dude!
0:36 RB team has the best banter on the grid
I'm not sure how far form the truth that last comment is.
It's amazing how different these cars sound when a non full-time driver gets behind the wheel.... You can actually hear the wastegates and all the trickery going on in the background!  On ya D.C!
Next to Shumi, DC was my favorite driver of his generation, I love that he's still in it.
As a fellow Scott - all I can say is , you only gave him one lap , couldn’t give him three or four 😐
I'm impressed he can fit in the car.  DC is a legend.
I wish this rocketship had a sound of v10
Perez replacement?
What a true Beast
You just gotta love DC
Not bad for a senior citizen!
you mean in the words of RuPaul "don't fuck it up"
DC you are an absolute legend. You have done and continue to do so much for the sport. Thank you from a lifelong fan
52 y.o. D.C. could still outdrive 99.99% of    all citizen road car drivers.
it is the most dominant but not the best in history
That’s amazing. Congrats DC - huge respect. Well deserved.
1:52 I didn't know they charge the car with USB-C, oh man!
Wish DC had a few fast laps in the RB19, now it's cut and dry outlap, fastlap, inlap. He was slow but like he said, it's lacking confidence.. you need more then 1 pushlap to build confidence. But great to see the oldie in the RB19... oldie.. I'm only 4 years younger XD ...
Lawson next to Max!!!
I’d have loved to have seen David and max do some laps together.
Did Liam bring his Supra?
The shot at 2:44 should be default go to onboard in TV broadcast. And i have no idea why it hasn't been done yet.
4:57 That sound of the engine at downshifting!...so cool🏎
Lewis complicated you guys so much.. let him have a go.. please 😂😂
Very funny when he said “i ve used to be good” - pls DC tell us when 😂
It's the same width as pre 1998 cars
Great vid, very envious and good to see you back in a car.
This is why we love F1, Always remember who paved the path.
This sort of thing warms my heart.  I know it's all PR, but there's also no other good reason to risk such an expensive item.  But to pay respect to a great driver, to allow a race driver to experience the very first then the very latest machine of very different generations - this is what it's all about.  Respect, fun, honouring those who came before you etc.  And you can see what it truly meant to DC to have such a rare experience. It's like seeing old race cars being driven flat out rather than gathering dust in a private collection, never to be driven again.  Excellent stuff Red Bull and DC.
❤❤
He reviews the driving experience like he's road testing a Hyundai.
Can we see Liam driving RB1 next please?
That was so awesome to watch thank you David coltar. I remember the days of you racing 15 years ago such joy. I've been following formula 1 since the '60s. Being that I'm 62 years old lol Jim Clark was my first introduction to formula 1
Throttle sounds a bit restricted to my ear. Either that or he's taking it easy.  Pretty wild.
I enjoyed this! I'm pleased for DC. I was there at the beginning (as a fan) too!
Happy for DC! Is Bro not allowed to use the 7th gear?
Why not softs?
DC ...Legend.
Your payment for being such a nice trash talker for the Verstappens, hope you really enjoy it cause you sold your honor and credibility.
did he just commented on himself while driving lmao, i cant even blink playing f1 cars in a sim game
This is great to see. Top job DC
RB1 sounds infinitely better
Imagine seeing dc with max in the same car!
He gave me the feeling that he drives a toy car compared to the real monsters he used to drive back in his era... I really miss those small noisy rockets of the past.. Really miss the real hardcore F1..
How good would it be to see the best F1 drivers do a fastest lap all on the same car?
VETTTTTTTEEEEELLLLL
horner next, pls
David Coulthard 🤝 Daniel Ricciardo = "Please please please Christian, please let me drive it"
Be careful mate , only and only MAX can drive this machine to its maximum .
Ah Pity you weren't engerlish David,Sky would have been kissing your arse.like they do with shamilton Russell etc! Freedom!!!
Why's it edited like Liam Neeson vaulting a fence? Literally couldn't watch half the lap because apparently it's more important to show DC's helmeted face.
I could only dream.
Next put vettel in it
Such a great story for DC - you can see the excitement. Never give up! Well done Redbull. When is Christian heading out?
His lap time was 3 days faster than any of ours 🤣☺️🔥
Love DC. Also....Spies Lawson in the Red Bull gear 👀 (Yes, I know he's the reserve for AT😅)
David was lucky Lewis wasnt around to put him in the barriers at copse 😂
What were the laps times (or best sectors), so we can compare to Liam?
Can I try?
The fact he can talk the whole lap full throttle is crazy haha
More like this, please 🎉🎉🎉
damn ! im miss DC on track ! 😢
He drove quite slow, he's an ex driver, he could have pushed a bit harder, that was extremely slow.
DC vs Seb five laps.  DC is great.
Coulthard is a fucking G. What a great and respectable energy!
What a Legend 😊... and the car looks also OK I guess...
Nice to see the enjoyment on his face :-). There did not seem to be any porpoising at all. Did they solve the issue totally?
I genuinely appreciate what the RB19 has accomplished, however I will always prefer the far more compact RB1 and its screaming V10.  Cheers DC.  We had a brief word before the drivers parade in Montreal 2005.
Nice to see. Actually wondering how Lawson went
DC always put out for the team, and still make good laps in the rb19 what a champion✌️
Big RB mistake, coulthard Is SPYmercedes.
It would be nice to see Liam driving DC's car too
Love this! Amazing to hear David's reactions
Rest well RB19. Privileged to have seen you perform.
Great video. It's a shame SIlverstone is a shadow of its former self 😢
😂😂😂😂
David Coulthard is the type of guy who can say "been here since day 1"
What an incredible opportunity experience the most dominant of the new F1 cars 15 years after retirement.
Amazing content.  And very wholesome to see one of my childhood heroes having the time of his life doing side quests now good for you DC 🥰
ベッテルにも乗ってみて欲しかったなぁ…
How is he is driving and talking the same time
I preferred Ralph driving the V10 Williams BMW, thank you very much.
Did he beat Max's fastest lap?
Cheating team with a cheating car
you get home after having an awesome day driving the rb19 when christian horner texts you saying ... was only on half power mate
Vettel please  ! ! !
Great but needed subtitles, like all radio messages on Sky F1
Question is why is Liam so omnipresent in the RB's garage with the RB19; especially the last ''advice'' from DC - "Don't f*** it up"? Something [good for Liam] is brewing..
Respect DC  ! You have always been one of my favourite characters in F1 (and I have been watching for 50+ years) and even though I am neither Scottish or even from the UK - I will always be a fan ! The expression on your face, the gleaming in your eyes showed it all ... a racer through and through ! Stay well !
Undoubtfully the best F1 car ever, but the car that made F1 boring as its maximum level...
GP: box box DC: 🤔... Nope
Vettel the goat
Got to wonder if DC got a clean lap or did some of it fall on the floor during editing. And did they speed things up a bit to make it "fun" for the Bull Boys and Girls. He is an interesting person and I always enjoy his commentary.
Let's put Lewis in it, just for fun.
Love to see him back in the car, brings back great memories. Legend and gentlemen for the sport
Are teams allowed to drive their out of season cars as much as they want?
I would have loved if DC talked a bit more about the differences between his generation and this generation of cars. More technical talk would have been intriguing.
1:24 That's a Daniel Ricciardo laugh haha
Who here is excited for 2024 /rb20
Seeing him brake for copse was hilarious. I don’t blame him, these cars are terrifying.
Coulthard was a brilliant driver. He did a lot for Red Bull and had faith in what was a fledgling team.
So awesome to see david in a modern redbull suit and car.   Also love hearing him throughout the lap, would love to have more of that from Max or Checo. Also other teams take notes on how to do content
I feel C Horner made the best descision in the hybrid era to sign Honda. That engine is and sounds insane
Why didn’t you sign David for next season? 😢
DC could still win Grand Prix’s!!👍🏼👍🏼🏆🏁
I love that he didn't call it "Sir Hamilton straight..." Had to leave that out, right DC?
love this content
SCOTLAND BRO YESSSS SCOT YES YES YES SCOTLAND BACK ON TRACK
Why did he only get one lap and not a few more?
@Oracle Red Bull Racing Wouldn't it be nice to let Adrian Newey having a go with the RB19 ?
I want to age just like DC
the smile on davids face 🥰
sorry for asking, but what was time of lap?
Vettel PLEASE
we will always love david 👍👍😊😊
DC is talking while doing the lap.......relaxed conversing to the audience.   That's how easy the new cars are to be driven...
50 year olds raced in the F1 in the 1950’s DC 2025 F1 driver ❤️❤️
I wish he would go into detail about the driving dynamics, I am very interest to how the balance is compared to other red bull f1 cars from other eras
i hope David signed an NDA......otherwise all info is at mercedes next year :P
Gotta love DC ... one of the most awesome personalities in F1!
Pure class.
Red Bull at 4:57 show us why the RB18-19 is the best V6 F1 car sound ever load of pops and bangs, barrrrrrrrr
I think Liam actually touched on one of the reasons modern F1 is so boring. The cars are too easy to drive so there's little room to really shine as a driver. If your car is fast, you're fast. We rarely see the good drivers getting out of sorts cause they don't have to wrestle the cars like they used to.
Could we put liam or max in the rb1 would love to see that😂
Love it, David is such a nice bloke.  Give him 20 laps and he’d be on Liam’s pace. Miss DC and that amazing era.  Good times.
Legend!!
Would like to see a few drivers get in and have a go. Seb and Mark in a pair would be cool.
I bet DC can still score some decent points. Do a Red Bull thing and give him the second seat.
would be nice to see hamilton drive this car when he's retired😂
DC is still one of the best, not just inside the car but outside with his self deprecating humour.
Och aye, that was braw!
Invite Barrichelo
Damn microphones.   With the buzz of the mike and the Scots excitement, hard to hear.
I would say, let the whole crew try the car, inclusive Marco Helmut.
I reckon if DC steps up for a whole year he'd be faster than checo for the second half of the season :D
It's so nice to watch a former F1 driver tastes the modern era!
I wonder how well DC would do if he'd actually race at this age.
that honda engine is the best sounding one in this hybrid era
Coulthlard is one of the most responsible person for the success of Red Bull. He really helped giving his experience and effort in building the roots of this team. So it is just AMAZING to see him driving the RB-19. Nuts!
Funny enough Liam Lawson wasnt even born when DC was runner up in the WC 2001.
Vettel's turn now
Happy for dc he put a lot of effort into building this team glad he got to drive their best car to this date
DC deserved this one
I’m absolutely thrilled to DC amazing person amazing driver
That was pure gold, thanks for sharing your experience David!🏁
DC is still a king!
"What your laughing at, I used to be good" He's such a nice guy. What a privilige it must be to be allowed to take the RB19 for a spin. Thanks Red Bull...
It's not sunny in Silverstone and shorts weather in December, and how can he drive the RB19, that is against the rules?! Fake Video
ive been watching his podcasts with damon hill and eddie. big up sir!!
Playing on GT7 the helmet looks familiar to me i did , also tried to recreate redbull liveries RB3 and RB19 to my best of abilities. DC was a fantastic driver and good sense of humour. The driver i followed in F1 back in the day
I've had the pleasure to work with DC on several occassions for these kinds of Red Bull productions. And he really is just as likeable, genuin, humble and professional in person as he comes across in the content.  He gives everyone the same amount of respect and time. Such a gentleman!
It's coincidental that the car is called RB19 and Max won 19 races.   With that logic, the RB20, Max will win 20 races in 2024?  I will come back in a year to see if this comment aged well. >.< Haha!
Love this man, such a character!
6:21 Are we gonna see video of Liam driving RB19 too? 🥲❤️
Also makes you appreciate El Padre the more
He not flat out....
the greatest formula 1 car ever built  - so far
this was not filmed recently, this must have been months ago
It's things likes this that make me a big RedBull fan It's for reasons likes this I love RedBull ❤🚀
I was watching a video on DriveTribe when I saw the thumbnail of this video of DC against what looked liked the RB19. I clicked so fast, I almost smashed my trackpad. 😂
his eyes remind me of michael schumacher, the legend
can you make 2024 exhaust mic like when dc going out from pit?
Awesome sight.
DC is right… bring back bridge!
Have dc race agaimst verstappen i reckon it would be interesting haha
Stoked for DC!!! He deserves a little sampling!
Now drive another one from the same grid, so you can compare right.
This Is illegally , because every teams can't use the cars of last 2 Years
Another Newey masterpiece!
DC was useless when he was racing and achieved nothing. Jenson button would be a better driver.
Thanks you Red Bull for all you do - Including this OBVIOUS heartwarming moment to let DC play in the newest legend! - Cough, did you ... let him try out in Checos car and keep Max's winner one(s) locked up in the vault? :) Either way, thanks for the entertainment and - Vettel next! Vettel vs Max, Q3 setup, 10 all-out laps each, 10 sets of Softs, on a classic track they both like in Europe! LET GO!
It would be more interesting if he drove Hamiltons car
DC in the RB19 and I nearly broke my finger clicking so fast
wow imagine that commentating while driving 120mph in every corner and G force wow such a Legend!
Why does it sound like it has an early-generation v6 hybrid engine like the 2014-2015 engine?
That’s so nice to see. Great guy, massive humor
Thank u
He’s thinking how fucking awful the car sounds compared to when he was driving and why the fuck are there fuel save modes…what a cuck sport it’s become from a gladiatorial one
"What are you laughing at?! I used to be good!" - No DC, you were great!
I wonder how much money we’d have to chuck in for charity to engineer a car-swap between, ohhhhh, I don’t know…. Sayyyyyy, Max and Lewis??
Cant understand a single word he said, so MUFFLED
"one of the most dominant" ....That means that next year will be even better 😏💪
DC got a drive before Grosjean, who'd have thought
I don't think that car is that dominant the gap between Verstappen and Perez show that. Compare to other seasons Mercades had bigger gaps in performance. It was the Dutch difference
DAVID ( CULT) COULTHARD ..SORRY  GREAT😂 Wishes from Austria
DC such a fantastic guy. Perfect video
Still perez managed p16 in that car in silverstone
Well done! Very cool :)
Honda The Power of Dreamsss 🔥🔥🔥
DC was my favorite driver when I was a kid. I just loved something about him. And now, he is my favorite F1 promoter. He still looks to be in great shape, talks passionately and throws jokes all the time. Such a joy to watch him. So nice of RB to let him drive the current car for a change. He definitely deserved it.
I have been watching f1 my entire life but i didn’t realize until recently how this motorsport wasn’t popular in the US. Fascinating to see a new fanbase growing in real time like this. My only quibble for actual f1 is the constant rule and format changes. I understand they look for more spectacle but it gets confusing sometimes.
Let's be honest anyone could win in this car even I could with some preparation and training as its more about endurance than now days the car if set up right dose 70% of the work just needs some about hold on 50+ laps
To me David Coulthard is the most friendly and sympathetic F1-driver of all time. I compare him to the late Stirling Moss.
Hell of a car, Max is one hell of a driver, and cheers to the team for putting together the most historic Formula 1 season of all time.
if checo cant deliver next year, DC: fine I do it myself
"I used to be good" DC - well DC it's better to be a has-been than a never-was :)
man this was cool seeing/hearing DC in this car and his thoughts while lapping!
Kinda curious what his lap time was compared to other lap times on that track
Breaking, David Coulthard to replace Sergio Pérez for the 2024 session.
Nothing like the naturally aspirated V12-V10 of yesteryear.......THE SOUND🤗
My lawn mowner sounds better than this. Sad
so you let an old timer drive a brand new car.
Thank you for not having any background music during the track session!
Thanks DC and Red Bull for an ear to ear smile throughout. Liam comes across as a thoroughly decent guy. Not my team but they seem to promote a family feel. Very enjoyable.
looks so natural to see DC behind the wheel ;-)
Ok now get Max in the RB1
I can provide a "heart-beat" of your system 😊
No kidding, if DC drove this car he'd have won the championship. Y'know, if somehow he transported this car back into the past and competed against the cars of the late 90's and 00's.  Just kidding though. What a beast is this car. Looking forward to next year's car!
thanks for sharing DC , watch out Max ,
we want to see  lulu have ago !
Nice of red bull to let a subscriber drive a F1 car
Good Morning. I'm an Italian F1 fan. I like Ferrari, but Max and you are the best now. Please, can I do 2 or 3 laps on your car?
Well deserved ❤
Still these modern cars have nothing on the high-revving V8s and V10s
Excellen! DC is such a genuine guy!
CAN WE GET MORE LIAM ON THE CHANNEL!!!
Good video 📹 👍 👌
The whitty humor of DC, LOVE IT 😂😂😂 And the comeradery within the team is so wonderful to see. How Liam fits right in. GP there. This was filmed on DR’s tyre testing day at Silverstone I think, few days after Silverstone GP. That’s why Horner was there too. I just love the humor and the fun RBR has while working hard with full focus.
*puts in a faster lap than perez
He and us  deserved more than 1 hot lap
😭😭😭 DC deserved this drive so much 😭😭😭 He looked so comfortable driving RB19. ❤❤❤
W11 was better
Awesome vid
David MaxiFanboi Coulthard! No titles for mr. u should give up...
DC sounds like Jackie Stewart while driving. Cool.
The sound of that honda engine as he pits💦
DC makes fun of himself a lot and often jokes that he wasn’t a great driver. But that’s quite far from the truth, he was a beast in his Williams/Mclaren days and definitely one of the top drivers at the time
Would be nice to have some subtitles for the video. My english isn't bad but the loud noises make it sometimes extremely hard to understand what they are saying.
Absolute legend
I thought private testing was forbidden 😛
Much respect for the team to honor its past drivers. RB is a team unlike no other. DC great to see them give you a crack at RB19.
I'm sure the RB1 is more exciting to drive. Much smaller, lighter, less refined, more nimble car, a screaming V10 at 900+ HP 19k rpm.
Liam in the red bull suit is odd but fitting
How much did that 1 lap cost?
😍😍❤❤🥰🥰
TBH, had DC got a few months to prepare, I wouldn't be surprised he could win a title in this car.
What you need to do here David let's have the engine taken out of the RB19 take that engine out and put in the engine out of the RB1 into the RB19 Then you'll have a real race car .  I still think the V/10 rules .
DC is top class. Was privileged to watch DC showing his skills and some donuts in Mumbai, India at Red Bull event in back in March 2023 😍
Who wanna see David race for 1 gp
Some of us remember that you were once on the verge of a championship season if not for the fate of others was the order of the universe. I bet you couldn't wait to share you experience with Max and compare the RBs with each other, lol! Enjoy life!
Was it rev limited to like 9k? Geriatric lap indeed. I like DC, but that was tame af
DC is gold! Love RBR team!
If that car is at a museum you will go see it. It’s as close to perfect as any F1 car has ever gotten.
Liam lawson looks right at home in the redbull colours.
All sector were purple, that's Pole Position (P1) for you DC 😅
Would love to see him race against Max, just for fun. Great guy.
WOW GOOSEBUMPS!!! D.C Driving the RB19?? What a fever dream!
DC You are a legend!!!
Glad the old man got a go!
Hearing DC say "down a gear" is shades of Sir Jackie Stewart!
Dominant yes, but it’s way slower than the cars a few years ago. This sport has become a joke in many respects!
That Aussie test driver is one cocky little shit
RB19 is such an amazing car I can’t wait to see RB20
Can someone explain his comment about breaking and downshifting in turn 1?
We need to get GP in a car.....
Only 3 laps? what a bunch of cheapskates
Did the audio guy get fired for clipping the hell out of his lav mic?
i think given a lil time even DC could still win the title in this car
DC has still got "it", crazy to watch a commentator reminding us that (in his words) "he used to be good"
At the end it should've been wah ah you laughing foh im being serieessh im being seriessh
wow this car Looks much real than simulator ha ha haaa...
How did they prepare a seat for DC to fit in?
I didn't know that the current hybrid cars can gently pull out of the garage (of from a stop) without applying any throttle - that's fascinating! Gone are the days of risking going into anti-stall when creeping out. Is that just the higher torque levels or something else?
DC sounds like he's reviewing a Ford Fiesta or something while driving that beast.
Dude!  What was your lap time?
I'm not gonna lie. Seeing DC in the 19 rustles me in all the right ways.
DC didn't used to be good. DC was awesome.
How nice it must be to be David Coulthard to be given all of Silverstone to be able to play.
Thank you Red Bull for dethroning Mercedes.  Now please give the fans what we want.  We want to have a close title fight.  We also need to know how Max Verstappen stacks up against the greats.  The fans deserve Fernando Alonso at Red Bull.  Even if it's for one year.  That would cross over into popular culture.
l miss DC drive f1 car years 😊😊😊😉
It's always good to see that helmet design in the cockpit of an F1 car.
So everybody but PER likes the car which was allegedly built especially for VER.
Ill say it over and over again, despite being a Merc fan, you absolutely have to love RBs marketing and the content they put out. This is just awesome to see, really fun video. You guys are doing a ton for F1 by putting this content out. Hopefully next year Merc gives you a challenge lol, good luck!
Could DC of out pointed Perez this year?
DC still got it in his 50s & still as square. LOL, just taking the piss out of you, buddy. You are still awesome.
Love DC Man! What a legend!
I wish I could drive an F1 car 😭 was my dream to be a race car driver, but wasn't in my cards.
Hope the VTEC kicked in........yo
Que incrível e legal
Just one push lap….. would love to see how the older generation’s lap times on that beast!!!
Loved this, DC is a legend. Give Liam a drive! He deserves it surely :)
Realmente espero que Liam y no Daniel sea quien ocupe el asiento de Checo en el futuro. Sería lo mejor Liam tiene carisma, juventud y velocidad. Cosas que ya no tiene Daniel
arguably the most dominant? you mean...actually the most dominant
It's good to see DC behind the cockpit again😍😍😍
F1 Video of the year
But in reality The most successful F1 car in history is a whole 2 second per lap slower than the w11... I feel sad that we have gone back in speed at lot
So wholesome! That was awesome!
Amazing. my dream
Newey next please.
Ol silver fox
Lawson - its very eazy to drive Coulthard - 🙂 Pérez - 💀
I guess they can't call it the "Hamilton Straight" in a Red Bull video, huh?
What are you laughing at? I used to be good. Anyone that can drive these cars is STILL good.
Why is DC driving with an expired helmet?
Making us Scots proud DC! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Not "one of the most dominant F1 cars". THE most dominant car ever. The RB19 and the RB18 are by far the best and most dominant cars ever made.
4:58 moment of eargasm
DC "UN"official driver lmao
Ngl, if DC could really go up against what he used to and what driver up against in this era, then i really curious what he'll be like to compete in a season or the least he would contribute some points in AT but really want him to be in RB
That was awesome. Thanks for the insight from DC himself.
They should give DC 2 laps
oh Liam × David 😀
When was this filmed???
David is truly living his best life…
i wouldnt be surprised if DC could still keep up with today's drivers
You're still good DC, a wonderful asset to F1 and a treasure to all of us who've ever dreamed of getting behind the wheel of an F1 car.  Thank you...
I’d like to see Sir Lewis drive the RB19. Just to see what he would say. It’s truly a remarkable car and provided a remarkable f1 season.
Will be nice if he can compare the McLaren car from 1999 to this one
Damn the mic on F1TV REALLY DOESN’T give the same sound of that hybrid V6
You should have @Driver61 drive the RB19
How about you guys replace Checo with Coulthard next season...
I wonder if old, out of shape, washed DC would have been faster than perez over a whole season 😂
I wonder if old, out of shape, washed DC would have been faster than perez over a whole season 😂
But what was his lap time and how does it compare to current F1 times?
That was an awesome video. Idk if there’s an Espy for short videos?
Now, we need all top tier RB driver in this masterpiece 👏
I’ll like to see Mark in this car in that unique helmet cheers
David: "Okay Box.." - .. you can just feel in David voice that he would've loved to drive some more laps to get a feel of the car to go faster... More to come next year I guess..!
man, he should be a commentator
what a video! Big up DC
Jos v.s. David... that would be really nice!
Es emocionante ver a DC con el RB19 Tengo 31 años y soy un gran fan de el! Me encanta que sea parte de la familia de Red Bull y que lo traten con  el respeto y el afecto que se merece 😁  Saludos desde Uruguay!!! 🇺🇾
Full Closure. For David Coulthard.  Life's Complete.
2:04 that shot made me emotional. I felt empathy for his old horse looking at him go with the newer, younger, more powerful one. Wow
It must have felt AMAZING :)
RB has the youngest F1 World Champion, time to break the oldest world champ record! Go DC! 😂
Any half-decent F1 driver could have won the title with this car. Coulthard in his prime would have been able to, as long as he could have beaten Perez, and I suspect that he would have, given Perez's performance this season. Sure, Coulthard could be inconsistent, an issue which a lot of brave drivers who like to drive close to the limit have, but the RB 19's good balance I think would make it easier for drivers like that to stay on the right side of the limit more often.  The main challenge would only be that you have to collect more points than your teammate. Other than that, any decent F1 driver would have been able to win the championship in this car.
Gotta get Newey in that car sometime, too.
DC who does not like this man? What a legend!
"David its Christian, you are faster then Checo!"
Stop cheating,…pricks.
Love you DC - great to see him get a chance to experience the thunder!
Since Christian has a racing background I’m surprised he has never driven one of the cars himself
That fpv shot from the stands onto the car was juicy
Must feel so happy to finally drive such machine glad he was able to do such job
RB19 is still ugly a sin just like every other F1 car this era and the engine sounds like crap
Im soo Happy for DC! legend
They have Liam Lawson driving the rb19? Sick
Bruh said it will easy to drive
Anybody can champ with that car. Eveb David old ass can win with that car.😅😅😅😅😅😅
They should do Lewis Hamilton next.
Amazing. Great to see DC out there.
Can you drag race this in the carwow channel?
DC was a good driver for Mclaren, he was just in the team at the same time as Mika was winning the titles.
DC rocks, I heard he lapped it faster than Max.
Brilliant - DC. Didn't take the old boy long before being up to speed in the car.
The faster he goes the more he sounds like Jackie.
Nice seeing DC putting in a lap in the RB19, he was there for the start of RBR and put in the laps. Some day many years from now, Max is going to climb back into this car and for many, it will bring tears to their eyes.
I don't think "One of" is even needed, this is THE most dominant car in F1 history so far
We want more DC driving modern f1 cars please ❤❤
You've got a smile with David, such a decent grounded bloke who's a joy to watch.
Amazing!! Thanks for showing the whole lap simply without over-editing
Lovely project! DC is a true gem!
Great to see David behind the wheel , the improved  traction through the corners , the cars have improved a lot since the last time he got in.
I wish they had given him like half an hour or so to get familiar with the car. It is obvious he could have gone a lot faster. Still, great video.
One of my absolute Childhood Heroes. So well deserved for all he‘s done.
It's something special about Liam coaching DC
please, more!
Glad for Coulthard to return to this car that he used to drive for 4 seasons plus pne as a test driver.
Car sounded like it had a different engine. No straight-cut gear sound on this one...
DC is awesome, I'm glad he is part of the F1TV team.
At this rate the RB19 is gonna become the W11 of this generation of Formula 1 car.
Should have given him at least a 3 or 4 full laps dude, just one full lap is peanuts
Man these camera angles are better than from Fom. These t-cam fov is so good. It's a shame we only get this zoomed in shit.
I think DC would be fighting for the championship with that car even in his 50s
I'm so sorry David Coulthard you used to be good but you're not Fangio or Ascari. Let Alone Helio Castroneves, Juan Pablo Montoya or even Fernando Alonso
its not argueallby the most amazing car in history its a fact no one has won so many races in a single year, max is already another 7 wins in a row since his record breaking 10 in a row can u believe!
happy for redbulll to do this, happy for DC. they should make this the off season chempionship. let former raceing drivers drive new cars...
Love DC
i'd be very curious what his laptimes actually are
This was fantastic
Please dont tell me He did better time than checo !!!.
"I knew I had one good lap left in me"- David Culthard.  That one hit me hard, may not be the best driver of all time but he sure sticks to me like the yolk i try to rinse from my frying pan.
plot twist,this is alry the rb 20,.been tested lol
Hasn’t lost his race craft what a thrill for DC  bravo red bull 🎉
I am 52 as well, still struggling with my Yamaha neo`s 4T scooter! 😁
still looking good , old man.
lowkey david should come back
What we need to know is the lap times for same car, same day, same track same everything accept drivers Max vs David.
At 1:52 you can see that this car's hybrid battery can be charged with a USB-C cable :)
Love the bit of Sellotape on the gap where the halo joins the main chassis. Probably 0.001 seconds worth of aerodynamics there.
No throttle on exit of the garage?? How😭
Let Kalle drive!
Wasn't this on Channel 4?
Coulthard was a significant factor in Newey signing for Red Bull. Given that, Coulthard may turn out to be one of Red Bull's most lucrative ever signings.
Lets go David. Going for Max's partner ey LMAO. Go get them tiger
Probably faster than Checo 🤣  This car is the best machine around fast and medium speed corners. But even Max has said it is a _handful_ to work around slow speed corners. Probably where Checo lost a lot of time. Especially when a slow corner leads to a straight.
Love to see things like this!
Came here for a clipping mic and was not let down. Thx.
Now let Robert Doornbos and any other Red Bull driver ever let drive the car❤🎉 Recommendation Kyvat last 😜
DC is a treasure :) Thank you Oracle Red Bull Racing for letting the legend drive the legend.
His commentating and this is perfect should definitely do this more
*the most
Seeing Daniel Riccardo in this will be a dream
That RB19 is one hell of a car, truly something special, honestly watching this video makes me sad that we will never see that car racing on the grid again, damn, I guess you really don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone.
He was marginaly faster than Checo there on that lap.
shame how gently he's driving it - i get that on a filming day you aren't supposed to thrash it around in quali mode but it does make all the talk about how planted the car is in high speed feel a bit silly when he's a gear or two down in every fast corner.
Wonder who would do better. Checo or DC.
DC the clown!
If it was the best car ever, why perez performed so bad with it?
What a lucky young lad this DC fella is!!! Proud of you for successfully advocating your case w/ Christian to drive the iconic RB19 which Max was able to win 19 grand prixs with, let us not forget the 2 grand prixs Checo was able to win as well!!!-!!!-!!!-!!!-!!!-!!!-!!!21outof22for2022-2023F1-Season
Can we get Vettel red bull videos? People r dying to see him
DC is used to redlining before shifting lol
Well done DC, RB... well done!
And then I ask: why the Austrian hymn? I suppose that only the beverage is Austrian and even so I have my doubts…
Gonna miss the rb19
As I know RB19 which driven by Max
David Hasselhoff belongs on the beach, not in an F1 car
W11 was more dominant, im sorry for ruining the red bull party
I would like to see LH driving this car......just to hear how much it's different it is....
that car was a  fucking monster.
Not the best in my opinion...these hybrids sound rubbish.   V10 and v12s feom the 80s and 90s only for me
Do this more! More ex-drivers! This is amazing! Make a ranking xD
Proper send off for RB19 is in order! DC first, now Mark Webber next? Seb?
Whoever done the sound for his helmet mic needs to be fired or at least trained in audio production 🤦‍♂️
liam lawson is the next max verstappen.
Respect to DC for that last joke, man can really laugh at himself.
Wooooooooowwwwww: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Other teams should do more of this. Nico to AMG Merc F1 to drive the new cars, etc.
Very cool - I'm sure those are going in a few museums for a long, long time.  The car that won all but one race in a season, remarkable.    We need a debrief from David!!!
This Coulthard guy could make a good F1 driver one day
DC for 2024
The take away from this video is that Liam Lawson is ready to take Checo's seat, lol
I love David Coulthard! So glad he is connected to Red Bull :)
Amazing!!
Good to see the "Flying Scotchman" going fast in a Red Bull again.
Genuine question here:   aren't teams not allowed to run any testing in cars that are less than two years old? In which case, why is it that videos like this are allowed to be made, even if it's not necessarily a 'test' session? How does that actually work?
I was surprised Couthard hasnt driven the almighty RB19. Glad to see him drive it
Watching my childhood hero driving this car puts a massive smile on my face. He's the reason I got into F1 and still watch to this day. DC is a legend 😎
Might as well give DC the 2md seat
That was very classy, Christian.  Well done, RB team.  Congrats, DC.  Cheers and Happy Christmas.
What many dont know is DC used to be Sergio of today, barely in the fight for wins and always 2nd best to Hakinnen
David is such a great guy, he is the one you wanna have on the table with christmas.👌
DC is a RBR legend 😊
A monkey 🐒 could drive that car.... Oh yeah... I forgot..... They did .....😅
DC you are a legend
Awesome DC!! simply lovely #RB19
Next One is Vettel pls! <3
Good for you   D - C.     This will open your eyes   Liam is the future..
Potential signing for 2024???
They Should put Mika into the Max's car so David would feel just like the old days 👀
Looks like they turned the engine down
Seb next please!!!!! Let seb drive it
One of the most? THE MOST
Quicker than Sergio ?
LAWSON IN RESERVE COOL FOR HIM..
I wanna see liam drive it so baad ffs
Liam Larson testing for Redbull! Perez is sweating bullet this off season and the next season. If he does like this season, he is gone.
Watching a legend like DC get back into a modern car is definitely a treat.  We've got the filler series like Formula E, the Susie Formula ... but I think what we all want is a Formula Legends where all the old school hero's get back into a modern car and go go broke !! Instead of Sprint Weekends with current drivers, let's have the old dogs battle it out.
They should have timed his hot lap, just to show how much is off the time of Max...
Better than Checo, tho
Now let’s see Liam in the RB1
Atta boy DC!!  Was smiling with ya the whole time!
Quick someone invent time travel so we can bring 2013 Seb to the future to drive this beast. lol
This car was not very dominant, was not that dominant as many many Maren, Ferrari, Williams, Lotus and Mercedes cars were with of 1.5 second and way more advantage over rest on the grid.
Just out of curiosity I would have liked to see his lap time. Even if it would have been very much below the pace
Wish this was a 20 minute video!
DC could have won a driver's championship during his stint at Williams, McLaren, and then RedBull when Adrian Newey left McLaren after Ron Dennis exit.
I love seeing DC in the commentary box and still getting after it with RB.
One thing DC has over Max in that car is DC didn't hit the wall leaving the pit box. So he's got something to hang his hat on. ;) Great video as always lads and lasses!
Dave - You never used to be good buddy X
Let's put Seb on it
Lucky they didn't give him Sergio's car
Love DC he is always on the nose with his commentary and his interviews, what a great guy just make a Redbull history series with him as the presentator walking past all the cars and what made them work or what made them fail
DC deserves it after all he's done for and with Red Bull! Good you guys honor him.
DC = Red Bull {2024 Formula 1 season Driver} DC Comeback 🤷‍♂️
The guy that helped get Newey to RB, gets to drive some of Newey 's best work. Beautiful to see
Wait, wait, wait: "... driving one of the most dominant F1 cars..." ??? Who made this title? It was THE most dominant F1 car of all times!
DC is one of my favourite F1 drivers, he has such charisma and also had some driving skills.
David is such a great guy! He deserved this opportunity
Credit to DC , the average human couldn't even press the brakes,  never mind a lap!
RBR is such a different team on the grid, from the loud music to how they seem to bring back former drivers like Ricciardo and now DC drives the RB19! Hat’s off to you guys.
Wel..... W11
Great video. DC still has it - he made it look easy to drive that car - which is a handful even for modern drivers. He managed to do a commentary while racing it.
DC is such a treasure.
Es Demasiado auto para David
He is driving Max´s or Checo´s version?
DC is great, best of the F1 commentators too
It's not one of the most dominant cars. It's THE most dominant car.
Great vid. Next time please put subtitles under David's comments during driving. i could hardly understand what he said...
Imagine Vettel driving it and decides to come out of retirement. 🤯
That C Horner is a big ASSHOLLE!
The coult. Great driver. Good to see him drive the best f1 car from 2023
My respects to you David. You are a F1 champion too.
I think 90% of the current drivers could have won the title in that car .
better than Checo :0
Would have been nice to go out in the RB1 again and embarrass Lawson and the crew with how much better sounding and raw it was
not even in his best he was good imagine now...
You should try the W11 😅
Such a lucky guy you are David 🤩
"The cars are very easy to drive" - Liam Lawson the man who replaced Ricciardo after he crashed, who replaced a De Vries that couldn't stop crashing.
Not bad for an ex-driver...
W11 > RB19
Max vs Coulthard >>>> Max vs checo
Now jos verstappen
Can we get seb in this car then?
😅
Amazing
Martin Brundle's commentary would be better if he was able to drive a current spec F1 car.
All they have to do for 2024 is, make the RB20 sound like the RB1, but faster than the RB19 - job done!
DC, an Iconic, a legend
DC is hands down the most likeable person in F1. You just cannot hate this man, an absolute legend!
Would of loved to see Liam in the RB1 beside him
Why the need for " arguably " ? it is the most successful Period. based on facts and records.
WANNA SEE LAPTIMES VS LIAM
Finally David gets to drive that beast, and he deserves it as he is that one guy who somehow never quit his RB job, even if they did not have a car for him. For me, he is like Marko and Christian, (a) Mr. RedBull.  So that being said, i'm really happy for David :)
This is so sick. Coulthard is such a cool dude, what a great idea for a video.
DC you are a legend
why they aren't full sending it ?
When that "Ok, box" statement was made at @4:50, I thought DC was going to say, "Eh, think I'll rip her around a few more laps, gents- see you in a bit, thank you!"
DC might have been comical but that was no joke🙄 Question has to be; Was it 18 times better?
Such an iconic helmet
Why is the impostor in silverstone and not at austria
Red Bill will never say no to DC . What a car!!
Red Bull makes the best content!
That's great.  Good to see Uncle David in that machinery.
Correction: THE MOST DOMINANT CAR OF ALL TIME*  There you go :)
Neither of them are taking Checos car 😂, I’m a MV fan by all accounts but checo did manage to secure the first 1-2 for RB I think that counts for something
I don't know who has the power of deciding where to put microphone on the car to enable us to have the sound of it during GP season. But he should be fired. I means, one lap here with where they placed the microphone is better than the entire season of onboard. Man, the brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr when low revs, the turbo sound...
Happy to see DC getting the respect
Could’ve had him do a voice overlay…not sure why you didn’t
0:49 they have lied to us... f1 is overrated
DC was a good racer, no doubt about it
Great video, what an opportunity for DC. Me personally I'd have liked to see a few more laps with DC getting more confident and faster and faster. But even this one lap, with live pundit/driver commentary, priceless!! Thanks to the entire Red Bull Racing team and to DC for making this possible. Truly epic! Next up: Seb 👍😁💪💯
Now that’s formula for success
Please invite Lando Norris to drive it! We want a LAP TIME
Put Sergio on the Alpha and give the RB to Liam.
Love this ❤
its still slower than W-11 but  yeah sure
Legend has it that even DC’s times around Silverstone were better than Checo’s - talks were held shortly after for the 2025 drive next to Max
Wonderful. Nothing but respect for this man.
Is it true? Liam is the official reserve for 2024,?
One could dream!
DC had some good preparation earlier when he drove together with Seb on the Nürburgring
"the cars is clearly build for Max and hard to drive for other drivers (Perez)'. Mean while David Coulthard: 'It's is planted, it's so smooth, it's so precise'.
One of the Red Bull drivers is not able to drive for a weekend.. Laim is busy.. David as stand in?🤔🤔
A fantastic watch. Love DC, he knows what he is on about and has everyones respect for it. Would absolutely love to see Seb do this and hear his feedback on the car. That would be incredible.
It was great to see that helmet in a formula 1 car again 🧐👏🙌
DC for president of FIA
This has been at the tire test days at Silverstone post GP.
The exhaust mic location for the onboard sounds so much better than the official F1TV onboard mic location. I wish they'd go back to the exhaust like they did in 2019 and 2020.
Great video
Get our favorite YouTuber, Liam, a F1 seat already. He deserves it!
I remember DC going around COTA when it was just a dirt track....
David will always be part of Red Bull somehow, he earned it.
Bloody Hell!
So Lawson will replace Perez for 2024?
Driving *the most* dominant car in F1 history
I have a huge amount of respect for DC he helped this team go forward, and i think the team know this
I bet DC could actually be competitive if conditioned and trained as in up to par and some simulation.
52 years and in such a gret shape, good job DC
now think back, red bull bought jaguar for 1 dollar... now they are the best team ! (also with seb. vettel) as an austrian, i'm very proud !!! 30 years ago no one imagend that an austria team would win an formula 1 championship !!!!
better than perez
time lap?
So good to see DC back in an F1 car, even briefly. Props to Red Bull for giving him the opportunity and extra good he didn't f**k it up. :)
I think it felt nimble for DC becuase even though these cars are 300kg heavier from his last season, its so planted that you're probably not fighting it and dancing around the entire time. Atleast that is the feeling I get when driving around in sims.
No matter what you think/feel about RB, that's a bad a$$ machine! Well done ORBR! I'm an overall fan of F1, and multiple teams!
DC looks *right* in that modern RB race suit. He still looks like he could be dangerous out there. 😎
they should let him drive the last years car every year :) !!!
That is what respect looks like. Bravo DC.... you used to be good ... indeed... But you are still great right now! Well done!
"Maybe i could win the WDC with this car." Sure, if Max quits racing.
That was simply lovely... 😊
100 times easier to drive then the old school cars
The joy in his eyes when he got pushed back into the pit while realizing what he just felt is great to see!
ok redbull now let lewis hamilton try this car 😭😭😭
Thank you, Red Bull and Christian, for letting DC take a lap in a truly beautiful, powerful, dominant, and awe-inspiring machine!
No it's Lewis Hamiltons W11 that's F1s most dominant car
Damn he got old
It could be a RB18-ish RB19.  Only the chassis number will tell if this is the early 2023 model or end of 2023 year
We're going to need to crowd fund a microphone for Red Bull. What with the cost cap n all.....
Simply lovely seeing DC driving Rocky!😉
Pls show us his lap time.....compare it to Max, Checo and Vettel's in the same car. 😆
The floor looks different
Cute.
The older I get, the better I was… 😊 Great drive DC!

Don't fuck Up 😂 Nice to see you behind the wheel David 👍
Geriatric Driver Control Engineering Procedures! 😂😂😂
The resignation and disappointment in that 'Ok, Box...' was palpable. I'm sure DC would have loved a few laps more...
If anyone deserved it it is D.C. Great to see you still manage to get it around the track without binning it :)
Thay should put DC on lap guides every weekend, just like Simon Crafar does in MotoGP.
What to go DC. 👍👍🏁 That was a great idea RB to have him back in the car. 👍👍
Thing is, he drove the best car in the grid at Williams and didn’t dominate, even Damon Hill won a title in that car! He is a good driver or was but not one of the very best.
Oh!, look at him, he could replace the useless Checo next season, c'mon RedBull, make it true  😒😒😒
DC wearing the Superman cape on the podium in Monaco; and doing donuts on the Burj Kalifa helipad... those are THE most iconic F1 moments IMNSHO 🏎️😎👍
Red Bull is kind of company which takes a good care of its drivers, Sebastian Buemi and DC are still under RB's payroll, Mark Webber had RB money in his pocket years after he retired from F1, the company still supports Marc Marquez in MotoGP despite he's been riding for rival teams since RB-KTM partnership and Alex Albon during 2022 season in Williams had it as personal sponsor, he separated from RB just because the nature of Mercedes-Williams cooperation. Kudos to Red Bull, I wish we had more sponsors like it.
CUAL LE DIERON A DAVID, EL DE MAX O EL DE CHECO, PORQUE NO SON IGUALES.
52 years old in an current gen era car is fantastic, you can see the old school early 2000s trackline approach  Quite a reward from Horner to a person who was dare to left McLaren Mercedes and switched to a "new" team run by drink company and develop the car from not competitive into very dominating..   Also how people remember DC nowadays : "Schumacher angry pitlane meme"
Vettel leaving RB then crying for a car from Horner is a cherished memory.
Love DC
Fantastic to see RedBull made this reunion possible between RB racing machine and DC. Would love to see Vettel get his chance as well!
This makes me wonder how he'd do in today's f1 in his prime
Vettel next please, don't make us beg for it. It just simply has to happen.
David, Max is faster than you.
My ex employer sponsored Stewart then Ford, where all this began.  Kudos to DC
An legend behind the wheel of the legendary RB19 that by now is historical as the best car ever! I cant wait for RB20!
DC!
Scotland the Brave❤
I gotta say: DC is one of the reasons I love F1TV.
🐐🐐🐐
This is just another way for RBR to get more test laps in outside the regs.  Smart
Why did he not need to use the throttle leaving the garage. How does it move forward?
We love David
I love how RB brings back their old drivers to drive some of their cars again and again!!! Must be a fun company to work for!!
Happy for him, RBR legend. This was a beautiful watch!
0:12  DC learned well, Powerpoint is how you get into top teams.
SEBASTIAN VETTEL NEEDS TO DO THIS
Imagine modern drivers - David C., Mika, Shumi, Senna, Prost, Mansell,Rubinho, Massa, Max, Lewis, Kimi, Sebastian, Nico R, and Villeneuve on the grid and driving Equal machinery ! today in their prime, SCARY!
The way a 52 yrs old narrates the track while accelerating and decelerating under immense g forces. Yeah, he could have won the title with that car for sure.
damn 🔥
There's no one who can possibly hate this man. What a top lad.
DC has humor, this was fun to watch...
Good to see DC driving a F1 car again after all this year he put the effort to Redbull
Oh hell yes!! Can't believe this actually happened haha, amazing. Thanks for the fanservice guys! Would love to see some more of the older drivers return for things like this!  Heck, why stop there, can we please just get some sort of mini "senior season" of a couple of sprint races between the actual F1 seasons please? where the old legends drive last seasons cars of their final teams?? just for the "im still faster than you are" bragging rights???  Somebody with some 'weight' email the FIA that we need this please 😉😂👍
Either I’m losing my hearing or the audio guy who set up DCs mic needs fired
Well done DC
Why do people say arguably the most dominant car ever.. IT IS the most dominant car ever in every statistical category…
Say what you will but max can make a normal car do something more! I know this isn’t a normal car but regardless
Get liam into the RB!
should bring those master pieces latest f1 car out more , when season end, some f1 car might in warehouse ,then never see these f1 car driving again , only redbull team do this kind of fun stuffs,   redbull dudes knows how to have fun.
An RB1 in 2024 to celebrate 20 years of RBF1 would be glorious.
DC is a Legend but also Legends get Old
❤ love DC from the beginning. Glad to see him take the rb19 for a spin. Thank you RB. What an iconic shot and the v10 at 0:0:22
Did RBR sacrifice a few filming kms for DC? Looked like in-season tyres and all even.
Simply incredible 🔥 Nice to see Liam, GP, CH, Tom in the video 👍😍
He earned that drive, shame he could not put in a couple more laps to really get a feel for this amazing machine.
DC seems like such a great lad! Fun to watch him drive and comment on his own lap too!
My absolute idol driving the most dominant car ever... I'd cut my jewels just to be in the grandstand...
damn 30 mins and 0 dislikes, good to see
Why do you call it 'one of the' most dominant F1 cars ever. Isn't it statistically THE most dominant car ever?
DC you a f n LEGEND
Holy Trinity of Formula 1: MP4/4, F2002, RB19
🏎️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿✨🏆✨🏁
Given the chance of driving RB1 or RB19...... I'd choose RB1 any day of the week to be honest! Mainly due to the fact that it has that raw, screaming V10!
Was at Silverstone on 6th September during the heatwave when this I believed was filmed. Thank you Oracle Red Bull Racing for doing this on that date, so could see an F1 car going round the circuit during family trip to Silverstone Museum to see the classic Prost Ferrari 1990 and Senna's 1991 McLaren. Worth standing on Luffield Corner being chased by a Wasp hah- Even a weird bot account reposted this in the comments.
😍👏👍🤙
I still love the Reasons Why PowerPoint ... what a class Act DC <3
DC reserve for 2024 confirmed
For all the work DC has done for RB to lay the foundation for what it is today, he absolutely deserves to experience such masterpiece of machinery. Now I wanna see Newey, Webber, and Vettel in the RB19 as well
"I Used to be Good"
David Coulthard to replace pérez 😂😂
It's a shame he only got one lap. I would have liked to see him get fully comfortable over the course of a day.
That was just something special to see!!
Well, it's not 'ONE" of the dominant F1 cars............It is literally 'the most" dominant F1 car
so beautiful👍️☺️
Enjoy your Retirement RB19
🥰🥰❤️
DC to Red Bull 2024
Its thanks to DC that Red Bull is what we know and love today
RB making dreams come true. Very classy move by all. God Bless you all.
DC is one of the smartest, funniest and most knowledgeable lads around, and it's an absolute joy to watch every time he does coverage for F1. It's so amazing to see him tear up the track like an absolute pro!
Give DC the drive next year, tear Max's contract up!   LMAO
LEGEND.  DC is not too bad either. 😁
DC in the RB19?! Love to see this!!
Love this
W content 🔥
Gotta love seeing DC in a F1 car, let alone in the best ever made!
We needed a special RB1 livery for next year's car as memorial to this event!
Can I drive the RB-19 please
David is getting ready to replace Checo 💀
DC what a legend
If I see DC and RB, I click. Simple as that.
DC another contender for Perez’s seat?
Perez's 2024 replacement confirmed
dc is such a legend
dc is great at what he does
Happy for DC, he put a lot of effort into building up this team, glad he got to drive their best car to this date
Lovely seeing that Scottish flag on the RB19's monocoque. DC is the reason why I ever watched F1 in the first place & why I follow this team 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏆
David Coulthard 2024 F1 world champion
This is sick, nice to see something after the season!
Luckly David 😅
This is your sign to bring back DC from retirement.
Omg
