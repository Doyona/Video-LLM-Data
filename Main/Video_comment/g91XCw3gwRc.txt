How can you have Steve Smith, Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer
He's just a brilliant cricketer.
welcome to CSK :)
what a playerrrrr
Born in Barbadian an English cricketer. Good to see him back.
A brilliant knock,what a catch by archer,
8:56 😂😂😂
Stokes and Archer oh do we english need you in the T20 World Cup…
Finishing job of the highest quality…the bowling is absolutely shocking from the Indians. Only Jofra Archer bowled alright. Also the boundaries are tiny…
Look at Stokes’ reaction to winning this compared to Headingley 2019 He understands what truly matters
Who’s the commentator at 2.26?
Archer arched his way into archery 🎯 class catching. Love you.
Hardik smashed 5 bounders form Tyagi bowling it full and wide but he keeps bowling it there 🤷🏻‍♂️
Which stadium is this? Looks really good
Ridiculous how easy he makes it look
Ishan kishan  That’s an unfortunate choice of names
His reaction to his own hundred tells you everything you need to know about the IPL. It's not proper cricket and the only reason they all play it is for the money. He looked like he wasn't really fussed either way.  If he got a 4 day red ball county championship ton for Durham, he'd celebrate more than that. Yet we're being fed this narrative that the IPL is somehow the pinnacle of domestic cricket. It's just crash bang wallop, who cares if we win, because we're all getting paid anyway.  Was this an incredible hundred? There was a lot of slogging, with short boundaries and some fortunate top edges. Do we have to sensationalise everything to do with the IPL? If this was incredible, what was his ton at Headingly?
Sar
Typical English cricketer not great stats , great performances when it matters most
Whatta player 🙌
Archer will happily bowl 90mph plus for franchises but can't bowl for England
What a game 😍😍😍😍
Such a talented sportsman-he can play baseball, and cricket....
That Last Over Of Tyagi and Hardik Pandya. The bowler is so predictable 😂
hi
But Ben is a great player
He was not that good
5:20 🔥🔥🔥and 13:06 horrible man take shower
I can't believe on off English player break world record wow
Stokes is GOD
Stokesy is a legend
The way Hardik Pandya keeps his eyes on the ball...
11:37 Pattinson here looking like someone's washed up uncle...
RR has 3 English players which are playing massive part for the team
Shoutout to Danny Morrison his commentary has been great as always
make this have one reply
Stokes reminds me of Gilchrist, only his other super power is bowling not keeping
“Only a West Indian could do that”... think finch, maxwell, Lyth, Stokes, Collingwood would have something to say about that
You could do with some variety in the crowd noises.
And that is why I call him Super Stokes!
Well today he was in he’s own mood Stoke well played
Benjamin Stokes The worrier👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽being waiting sometime to watch your come back to the game.  Superb batting vs No1 team of the league.
Hardik's innings was absolute class and the total was competitive. But Ben stokes makes an absolute mockery of it 😂 . Honestly, you could set 250 and I bet you'd still feel uneasy until the moment he is out.
I guess mumbai is nothing without rohit
Stokes fails most of the time and then come-up with an innings like this, so people forget his failures... Just look at his batting and bowling average to see, how medicore he truly is...!
Nice hundreds for ben stokes
It was often said of the late England football captain Bobby Moore that the better the opposition and/or the more important the game the better he played.  I think that can also be said of Ben Stokes too.  He makes a huge difference to any team that he plays for - whether it be a stunning catch, overs of really good seam bowling, tactical advice or a game changing innings.  Any team, be it a World cup winning side or a struggling IPL franchise, are just so much better when Ben Stokes is fully motivated, playing and in form!
RR bowling attack is just weak, they shouldn’t have to rely on super human innings like this.
No one talking about Hardik Pandya 60 off 21
Interviewer  In the world cup : Would you pick jofra in your team ?  Holder : no coz he's English  Commentator on this match : Only a west Indian can jump like that . ... Awkward 😂😂😂😂😂
Stunning Catch by Archer, skipper led the match and our Sanjay was the backbone of the innings .Great to watch
Over confident pandya during innings break tells Ian Bishop to remember the name. 10 minutes later drops Ben stokes and the match.
Every one should appreciate RR team management for believing on Stokes because he wasn’t at his best until this innings and he kept his strike rate over 150 since start to end, compares to his previous  innings in this year ipl which was almost run a ball and hasn’t even hit a six or a 50. Any way it’s a brilliant comeback for Stokes Well done bro👍
Sanju😍
at 3.18  he plays for England, not the West Indies.
curran needs to play instead of tyagi
Royals’ bowling (apart from archer) is god awful
Stokes fantastic. Samson played a great innings as well!
ARCHER is  a legend
Tyagi has got to go, awful bowling once again
That reverse hit @9:50.... ?!? We need to put the red blue yellow cape on this dude Stokes where it belongs
What is the though process behind a team when at the auction they bid for Rajpoot or Unadkat, the team is shooting themselves in the foot.
you know its a good take when sky actually shows a replay!!!
Who is the best all rounder  Ben Stokes likes Hardik Pandya comments
Why does smith have a shrey helmet with a masuri neck guard
Simply the greatest cricketer on the planet today. I want to meet him and tell him what he means to us all and to me. An inspiration.
Its Sir Ben Stokes😎
He said “only a West Indian can do that” when Archer is English
Hardik brilliant finish
Sorry i dnt know but wt happnd to rohit sharma y is he not playing
Stokes 🐐
Go-Go Gadget Jofra arms!
I would have thought that Stokes would have been dropped before this game. Stokes showed his worth by putting on a great performance. Archer's catch is probably the best I seen in the IPL this year. ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. Expression on the bowler was priceless.
Jofra nearly sent De Kock’s wicket into an Unacademy cracking six
Wow stokesey!
Stokes is back in form everyone be scared
Can see the logic of Stokes opening - if he fires, he wins the game. He hasn't had a great IPL so far, but maybe a turning point? That catch by Archer though, he has no business catching that
OMG ARCHER! WHAT A CATCH!
Why was pandya so serious after playing a fruitful innings..is dat a leaf from bollywood acting. How to act after batting well.😂😂😂
Stokes didn't pick up a bat for two months and experts were surprised he was struggling
YES STOKESY!
I dnt understand why these bones(bowlers) cant bowl yorkers
He just is the best all round cricketer, he is a match winner, who comes in when u need him most. Well played Sir Ben Stokes.
what a difference a week makes. archer couldn't catch delhi belly and now he's back to catching scorches on the boundary. great game
He never give up
Filthy catch from Archer!!!!
Stokes > Kohli
smith is honestly a waste of a batting spot on the rajasthan team
Sanju and Stokes complimented each other, taking  the pressure off, What a great player Ben❤❤❤❤
She will win the cup
Form is temporary Class is permanent
Class player Stokes One of my favourite English and RR team player,Enjoyed your knock buddy Also young Sanju played very well also👌
Why isnt buttler behind the stumps?
What a catch from Archer!!!! LIKE STOKES IN THE 2019 World Cup against South Africa!
such a good player to watch. It's so exciting to watch these innings, especially in test cricket, but the most important thing for me is that he's quickly developing consistency in tests - scoring those 40s and 50s in between  the headingley type innings. Fantastic player
What a performance by Ben Stokes🔥👏
Hardick Pandya was the best today
Wow Tiwary got fat
Stoky Such a Super Classy....
That archer catch at 3rd man 🔥
I think both rajasthan and Punjab will make a comeback and go through
Amazing win. All credits go to classy Stokesy
Hardik was again shown who the best all rounder of his generation is. Someone whom he can only dream to be. There is no comparison between Pandya and Stokes. Pandya is good but just not of Ben’s class!!
Where is rohit?
Great chase by RR. Why is not Rohit Sharma playing?
Different level. 🐐
ben stokes, in a class of his own as per.
When Stokes is on the other team, you’ve never won the game until its officially over
Great lad stuiky
Ben=👍
Best all rounder in world cricket
Never write him off ever
Good job
The person on my profile pic just played an incredible innings
Superman Stokesy! This time the catch was Archer!
Stokesy with a masterclass
He’s just class.
Brilliant
