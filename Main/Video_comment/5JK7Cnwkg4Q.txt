Wearing a white skirt is more suitable for Leylah Fernandez ... 😂😂❤❤🤣🤣👍👍
It seems that in the WTA only Iga can maintain the level for over a year (despite several defeats). A true QUEEN, a true CHAMPION.
Very hard time to see LF's loss.
Iga the fake phenom exposer
Iga is fantastic but I love Leylah more.. maybe because of her style of play and movement on the court.
Iga is so winning this tournament again in 2023. Hopefully AO too.
Iga came back.
Обосралась выскочка Фернандес... чего и следовало ожидать
冒頭、ラケットをそのまま片手に持って入場するのは、ラファの影響かな？
F!!! I watch her match in 2019, 2020 and now. Clearly a different player on court There will be some days like that for Iga 😌 To be precise, the probability of a real Iga and fake Iga appear on court is 50-50. When it's real, it's fire and demolition. Otherwise, it would be an UE and lost-break machine
First time with Swiatek I see play where the other player winn the same number of balls but the end of the game is disaster for the other player.
Amazing player with an awesome arsenal of shots !
la seule joueuse qui pourrait poser des problemes a iga swiatek est la chinoise zenck le reste les doigts dans le nez
Did the Fernandez win the game? I am a little confused.
leylah reminds me of wozniacki but lefty and with a better forehand and worse serve
Impresionante, cómo juega Iga, ella es fabulosa. Cuántas habilidades y destrezas posee, además de que es muy inteligente. Que el Señor Jesús siempre te lleve por el camino del éxito y del triunfo. Dios te bendiga siempre bebé.
Oh my gosh, I just love the voice of the lady who introduced the players .
Iga Świątek is  now fourth in the world rankings . I would be happy if she managed to get 1st place!
Unlike Kerber, Leylah is a predictable lefty.
I think Iga has the game to reach world #1, and think she will climb to #4 after today (2/26/22).  As a fan, two things I'd like to see more from Iga:  1.  Play like she did in this match - with a little more aggression  2. She's very likable off court, but I would like to see here relax and smile occasionally on court.
Misery guts Leylah, gets beaten by the better player Iga 😀
The first slide down . Fernandez was a blip nothing more
crazy how swantek can beatup both these girls who reached the US open finals. trouble is she couldn't get to the US finals herself because she loses to opponents (such as bencic and sakkari) that those girls are able to beat wtf
Oh, how can you not love Iga play tennis.
The two ladies giant killers, Emma Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez, are both out of form. I like the syyle of play of iga Swiatek and Emma Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez.
My two bests
bien x Iga excellent game !!!
Fernandez is a joke. WAY over rated.
Both 2021 US Open Champ and Runner-up haven’t really shown the form which brought them to the top of said tourney.
good match!
Iga’s play is so beautiful and clean it makes me want to cry
Leylah should look for new coach, new voice
Lesson number 1 : keep being humble  Lesson number2: keep feet on the ground. Lesson number3 read lesson one and two. This advice for Fernandez and Raducanu and whoever is managing their careers.
The Match up we have been waiting for.
women are never consistent like the men.
boycott Australia Open....don’t buy anything Made in Australia...let Australia dictatorship tyranny government of deep state go starving
again the gulf in class is obvious . Leyla may  not reach another GS final i dare say but think she is a better player than raducanu
Both US open phenoms getting absolutely crushed. At least Fernandez did a little better and I believe she will continue doing better.  She needs to work on some things but I think her game can be tuned to become a winning one.
Fernandez have grown really tall since I saw her last time
simply a beat down.
Iga❤
I like Iga's play style
Iga needs to do exactly what Raducanu did after the US Open: get rid of her coach. I have nothing against him or her team but these guys are just not good enough. Time for next level tennis. Iga’s next coach should be someone who played at the highest level or even won slams, not the average Joe sticking around for the paycheck. Her team did a brilliant job bringing her to this level, time to switch gear now.
Australia is the new Germany in 1934
LEYLAH  NEEDS  A  NEW  COACH..
Leylah's playing style is horrible glad she's not going to be successful in her career, she got smoked by a real player
Fernandez ❤️🇨🇦
Вага Святек - супер!
Swiatek can seriously make a run at Serena's record, she is absolutely dominant and has been in almost every match i've seen her play.
Leylah Fernandez is really good player, no doubt. I see Hingis-like playing style out of her, but just like Hingis, who eventually had to bow out to power hitters, I see the same fate could happen to Leylah. She can not climb up to the upper echelon of professional tennis if she doesn't improve her power game. Sure she has sharp anticipation and quick reflexes for her size, but in the era of big power players, she will be constantly demolized because her strokes lack consistent punch and not penetrating enough against big hitters.   In her excellent run at the US Open, other players were probably unfamiliar with her playing style, but this is professional tennis where coaches & other elite players always studying one another. They finally crack her patterns and style, come up with solution: attack her relatively weak serves, pin her deep on the baseline to cut her preparation time (and force her to hit short reply), and not letting her create sharp angles.   She, in my opinion, must work on her strength more to keep up with big hitters. Otherwise, it will be extremely hard for her to replicate her run to 2021 US Open final.
Nice free tennis lesson.
Fernandez has to work so hard to get anything, poor girl. Women's tennis is at its height, I feel like. It is extremely competitive. But, Barty may change that this year and start to look like she is just a level higher than everybody else. It will be interesting to see what happens.
Great Warior. Congratulations 🌹
Shame on the WTA and ATP for not banning all games in Australia like they did with China! They are committing crimes against humanity!
Mutants tennis show in Australia's concentration camp.
Swiatek will  fight to  the  end
With glowing hearts
Young Canadian fighting for  glory
Full match please
Always rooting & believeng for Leyha Fernandez. Losing is a part of winning, comeback strong 💪🏻🙏🏻
7:23 that was a cute shot by Iga! :D
My Iga Pie. :* :*
Fernandez needs to keep that same energy
This was one of the most defensive matches I’ve seen from Iga. Her forehand didn’t look like it had the same pop as it usually does.
Gratulacje IGA ŚWIĄTEK  . Piękne zwycięstwo i emocje  . 🇵🇱
Leylah plays like a junior player , nothing really special , just because she can run fast doesn’t mean that she is a good player, still has a long way to go
I don't get the fist pumping after they win a point.  Every point.  By both of them.  It's even the freakin' thumbnail for this video.  You won a point.
The score looks like an easy win, but the first set was 40 minutes long, that's a lot for 7 games. Leylah was fighting hard most of the match, but Iga prevailed in the crucial moments in almost every game they played. Hard loss for Leylah, but she will get better, probably needs to get a bit stronger physically, she looks so fragile and her serve is not really a weapon, she needs to fight for every ball. But I think that's why many people fell in love with her at the US Open. Hopefully both of these young players get a lot of wins this year.
Iga mam nadzieję że zostaniesz dominatorką kobiecego tenisa..
Are the adelaide and melbourne tournaments just a warm to the AO? Can someone explain plz!? I thought the AO is happening already
kocham cię Iga
Swiatek has a great kick serve
Hopefully the viewing figures hit rock bottom and it all goes to shit.
These two will contend for the top 5 through 2030
You can see that Fernandez is not a good sport. Swiatek brought her down to earth. Excellent.
Both players are young and have time to continue to improve on their game. Iga is 20 years old (born on May 2001) and Leylah is 19 years old (born on September 2002). They are 1 year apart but Iga has more experience. Iga is the 2020 French Open CHAMPION
what a dangerous opponent Iga is
*_Fernandez expended all her energy with her big mouth when she was telling everyone she can beat Emma Raducanu. Sorry, but Emma the real deal as we saw at Wimbledon and of course the US OPEN whereas Fernandez is just a One-Trick Pony or One-Hit Wonder as she proved here by losing in dramatic style._*
LETS GO CHETAN
So disappointed with Leylah's performance level. 😱 She looked like juniors in Pro circuit. She has to improve a lot to level up on the Pro Circuit.
I watched all Leylah's match last night. Abysmal 1st serve and a variety of errors done it for her. Swiatek played very much at the top of her game, was very impressive and never made a slip. Leylah's defeat was reminiscent of Emma's loss to Marta Kostyuk in Romania, just didn't know how to stem the flow. Leylah has had a decent rest but looked sluggish and needs more match practice. Jorge even resorted to looking at his phone at times. A bit of a reality check for Leylah here but she'll be better by start of Melbourne I think.
Swiatek uses so much top spin and high kick serves to put Leylah out of rhythm and harder for the balls to attack
Poor leylah .....she played well but really got a lesson here ........
Brawo Iga
Swiatek was all over her from the get go, taking the ball so early. Fernandez was just suffocated
Iga Swiatek is such a well-schooled tennis player maan, wow! Her shots are picture perfect, even when she's caught off-guard and has to improvise at 7:30 in the video, she seems so controlled.  Take nothing away from Leylah Fernandez who is such a fighter and doesn't give away much on the court, Iga had to play a good game to win this match and that's what she did.  A next thing about Iga is, she's so patient and always have her emotions under "wraps", very even-keel.
Sorry for Leyla she deserved  to win
More of this Iga please..
jesli widzicie to chłopaki z wk na live to chce bluze z wkdzik pozdrawiam
looking for swiatek raducanu
this is a new version of iga swiatek
There's a lot of Fernandez haters for various reasons (the family's behavior at the USO, the hopping, fist pumping) but I think perhaps we are seeing that both her and Emma may have found they took a shortcut to a final that neither may not reach again.   A lot of the top players missed the USO and/or had injuries... now players have had time to study both of their games, found their weaknesses, and the chess match that many of us don't even understand is being played on the court.  Simply being young, full of energy and appearing athletic doesn't win tennis matches.   Perhaps both of these youngsters will prove us wrong in the Australian, but there are hundreds of amazing female tennis players out there and to be at the top takes something very special.
so happy that shit-nandez lost
I got the feeling that Swiatek knew she wasn't going to lose that match.
Leylah might be just too small and lightweight to be consistently competitive for the modern game. Also her fitness coach is super creepy too.
And also something else that I noticed, Iga seems to be a little more muscular. Not a lot just a little bit and she seems a little more powerful.
światek is looking physically stronger than ever, probably it's the new coach influence who often talks in interviews how important it's in modern game to have a lot of power, it's a nice change cause i think the old coach downplayed the importance of strength, the same with iga's father, im glad now it's changed, Fernandez was never able to counter Swiątek power in this match, and she has a lot of work to do to be a top 10 player, she's short but Barty has showed it's possible, also Sakkari had an amazing year
love how Swiatek slides into her forehand like she playing on clay.  amazing
Swiatek's sliding neutralising shots look like those you'd find in men's tennis.
What really impressed me was Iga's movement. She's FAST. And, she has almost Novak-like stretching ability. That's on top of everything else that was working. It will take a VERY strong player to stop her in this form.
Down to earth time
Leylah has ZERO energy if there is no crowd behind her.
Iga played really well in this game. She showed who is the champion!
Leylah is my third favorite tennis player but she has a lot to learn. Iga is one of my favorites too, below Leylah, but Iga is much more well-rounded player at the moment:
Fernandez , a beautiful baseliner, is hampered by a lack of pace in the first serve. That's why Swiatek was able to dominate on Leylah's serve. Needs gym muscle and some shoulders like her friend Coco Gauff who can hit a first at 200kph. Look for both those young women in the near future to win Slams.
BRAVO IGA !!!!!!!!!, what a match, what a performance. Keep going IGA !!!!!
that combed that received leylah. we hope you learn from this defeat
Leylah made it too easy for Iga. A lot of unforced errors and double foults. Iga Swiatek always dominant against players that don't have a lot of power. But always falls apart against players that have more power than her.
Fernandez looks good in highlights... if you do not place the ball well she will finish it, but here in this match she was outmaneuvered by Swiatek
Iga is in a class of her own!
I love watching Swiatek when she's in the zone. Sometimes her play reminds me of Serena - balancing deep heavy strokes with shorter angles that pull her opponent completely off the court.
Leylah didn’t even play bad - Iga can really run away with a match when she played well
Well done Iga! It was an annihilation.
It looks like Swiatek improved her groundstrokes during the December break.  Near the end of last year, especially at the top-8 tournament she played terribly, making many errors from her baseline groundstrokes.  Only when playing like this she proves that she belongs to the top 8.  For Fernandez, and also Raducanu, I think it's hard for them to repeat the success they did at the last USO.  It might take them a few years.  IMO Fernandez has less room for improvement than Raducanu.
You can tell by the focus of these highlights on Swiatek that she was the winner.  Obvious.
When she's focused and calm, it is very difficult to beat Iga Świątek. She puts a lot of pressure on her opponent with her aggressive way of play and it really takes something more than usual to confront her with equal chances. Fernandez is definitely a top 10 material, but today she showed that there's still a lot of work ahead of her to accomplish that goal. On the other hand, I get the feeling that major lack of audience is something that helps Świątek in her performance. If AO is going to be played in similar circumstances, this could be a very productive beginning of year for Iga.
Bravo Iga🥰🥰🥰🥰
Leylah is saying “now I know how to beat you in the real “Slams”
Creates angles, low errors and hard hitting. Iga did dominate the match. Too bad for Leylah. I don't think she played her best tennis.
The beginning couple of games were so tight and the quality so high, that I thought this was gonna be an epic 3 setter for sure. But then Iga just lay the hammer down! Very impressive
A much needed slice of humble pie for the "young gun from Canada."
Jazda Iga 🎾🎾🎾🎾pięknie i teraz Azarenka… pozdrawiam z Wiednia
Love watching Swiatek!! ❤️💜🔥
To me it was as simple as this: Iga hits the ball with much more pace than Leylah...she just hits it so much harder!
wow Iga
That movement from swiatek is like djokovic   Such strong sliding movement on hard fantastic
Serena would eat IGA serves!
When Fernandez gets a serve thats a weapon,  her tennis life will skyrocket. She chasing too many balls on defense the whole match.
I get bored with the clinched fist after every point scored. So shallow.
Leylah must change her dad as coach. I said this 3 months ago. Lets see
Yay Swiatek, first girl tennis player in a very long time I'm excited about. Hope she prevails!!
Leylah is young and if she keeps focus on her training with a good Coach she will be champion. I don’t think she will be as lucky as she was in the US open this time
18 double faults by sabalenka 18. 4 service games in a row where she got 1 second serve in just 1 hitting bottom of the net.missing the service box 4 to 5 feet or more way worse than this match by fernandez
Piękny mecz w wykonaniu Igi, wielkie brawa.
Iga = pure fire.
right wta  show highlights of this poor showing by fernandez but nothing of sabalenkas meltdoen. which was way worse than this.
Iga is a good player but she doesnt have the star aura. Leylah has star material.
I Love Swiatek playing when she looks relaxed and focused on every point. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I love both of them. Iga is superior today, when Iga is ON she’s unstoppable. Leylah is still in development, but she’ll be a star.
Mark my words...Fernandez will never make it to another GS Final.  It was a fluke.
Congratulation Iga! 🥨
Świetny tenis gra kątowa, ostra, taka cię pamiętam z turniejów np. Toronto. Warto było nie spać 💜💜💜💜❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘
poor Fernandez… Iga’s topspin FH bounces too high for her, and her kick serve is difficult to be returned by LAF. Her shots were extra deep today too
Still of different class between these two players. Fernandez still have alot of work to catch up but she has potential.
O ador pe aceasta tanara poloneza ,are un talent deosebit si muncitoare bravo ei si super de frumoasa .Are toata viata si cariera ei inainte este super tanara si se vede ca stie ce isi doreste de la aceasta viata. Succes frumoasa Swiatek.
Iga Światek wraca !!!
8m 20s feels like only 2m 30s. Leylah need to be patients, she needs more experience with to players. She'll improve.
Nice. Super and Profi!
Without a great serve and powerful groundstrokes, it's almost impossible to beat Iga... As an Iga fan, I would like to see more progress on the serve and the net play, but I'm satisfied so far.
Fernandez  jest Super 👍mimo wszystko lepsza .
Iga will gave  very good year I feel,
I'm a 55 year old average club player and would comfortably beat Lalya. Most 10-11 year old boys in the regional circuit would beat her
Absolutly great play from both. Iga  play with more vereiyty and solid  strokes .Has cut down on unforced mistakes. Great ! And remember to follow up at the net !
Damn such smart play from Swiatek. If only she had more mental strength, she could be at the top anyday. To me shes even better than Barty
Glad to see Fernandez lose. I was rooting for her to win the U.S. Open and then she acted like a fool and now I’m done with her.
Zmuszają te dziewczyny do noszenia szmatexu.Powinny z bojkotować te zawody .Niech sobie Żydowki znajdą  i niech im grają --- w co tam chcą ,bądź w im do łbów żydowskich przyjdzie
Superb performance by Iga! High intensity high level. Wishing her best of luck on the up coming AO
Hi leylah watching from cayman island.
This was some serious ass whooping damn..
Iga you are the best 👍👏👏
well done Swiatek, hope you will keep that form until AO 😉
Iga just destroyed Leylah, lol. Another overrated player again.
Not even that close.
That lopsided score was expected, she cannot play that level all the time shameful effortless perfomance for USOPEN finalist on the same hard surface,
Go swiantek мы тебя любим ты обьязательно везде и всегда победишь удачи тебе
Such a sore loser leylah is, look at her face during her handshake...
jest dobrze
Muy buen partido Iga, has empezado el año con mejoría en tú juego, enhorabuena. " Desperta Ferro "
Anett Kontaveit. Where ara you????
👏❤💪🇵🇱
Another fluke !
Incredible shots from  Swiatek. Just like Emma she has a very good IQ in playing her opponent  leylah has the fighting spirit attitude but she needs to learn her opponents weakness.
Congratulations sweet Iga Swiatek i like u & love u very very much 👍👍❤❤💋💋
What happened to leylah doubles match
Hype around Fernandez gone up in smoke.
Leylah’s court positioning was a bit off.  She did not position herself on the right spot to hit winners.  May be the legs are still a bit rusty.
Congratulations to Iga and to her new Coach! The win looked so easy for her. Good luck to Leylah in the AO or she may still want to try another match in Sydney WTA 500 or Adelaide WTA 250 before heading to the GS in Melbourne for more practice.
Bravo Iga!
Nice cricket shot by Swiatek
Am I the only one to think Fernandez’ footwork did not seem to be at the level it was before?
Yes Iga!!! 👏👏
Iga go🇵🇱⚾️⚾️⚾️
Leyla simply didn't have her day. I am Iga's compatriot and I support her but Leyla is very talented and perspective player. Also very nice person.
awesome job. actually thought leylah would snatch this since she is freeier without anything to lose. iga is finally coming into her own. until she meets bartycofc
So many empty seats??
Kochana Igo... Przez Ciebie odechcialo mi sie dzisiaj spac...Twoja Przyjaciolka tez wspaniale wygrala...!   Good Luck...!
Damn Leylah got demolished
Swiatek hits clean like female jannik sinner
Leyla kept serving  to Swiatek‘s backhand. It was too predictable and Swiatek’s BH is too good.
What a match! What a performance by Iga! Simply anihilated Leylah despite a very good play by Canadian. I have noticed Iga's arsenal of tricks got enriched with the arrival of former Radwanska's coach, Wiktorowski. There are subtle changes in tactics, building up the point but also a vast improvement in serving
Those Poland stars are sooo cute! Iga and Hurkacz!!
Chociaż Świątek zwyciężyła w sposób miażdżący t wyświetlili więcej zwycięzkich piłek filipince.
I love swaitek!!!
Iga played flawlessly today. Leylah is looking fit but she needs more power in her shots. Too many sitters for Iga.
Leylah is going to have to consistently hit the ball deeper than she did today.
Totally crushed this iga
Swatek too fast lots of energy
Why did the Canadian woman lose clothes sponsorship?
They know how she plays now. They are going to be all over her
Beautiful . That was good. So exciting to watch you play like that .Period. NJ
I said it many times... Swiatek needed to lose her coach, happy that she did. The man was leeching off of her without having any sort of positive influence on her tennis game. Those are the people you need to watch out for. If you can't help or improve someone's tennis then you don't belong there.
Love the game of  swaitek,clean hitting with good footwork
Season just starting. I think people think Leyla Fernandez going play US Open style every time she hits court. Lots of Tennis 🎾 this season for her to improve and get better.
Two of my favorite players! Leylah is at a stage where she can never lose but win experience at every match at the top level. After US Open no one takes her lightly so I am not surprised they try to beat her 6-1 or so. Iga I'm glad you are working with a more experienced coach now, it shows in your game tactics, finally. Can't wait for RG 2022.
Swiatek é uma das mais completas jogadoras com apenas 20 anos. Vai longe. É maravilhoso torcer por ela! Leylah será uma das grandes também,
Seems like Iga is getting back to her best.
Not a very good start for Fernandez
1:05 Leylah produced the most beautiful forehand shot of this match or probably this tournament; but Iga is a better player today; she truly played like a champion and she is.
It's ok Leylah has plenty of time to get better . I love her so much . Congrats to Iga
my two favs to watch and cheer, go Leylah- from Canada.... you have the goods...
YES, YES, YES that's how you dominate Iga!!!
brawo Pani Iga - Powroci do swojej formy i obroni tytul
Iga Swiatek has lot of shots and can play great when she is calm. Iga may have some resentment against Emma Radacanu and Laylah Fernandez considering she didn't get 5% of the publicity or endorsements compared to them. When Iga won the French Open, she beat top players/ GS champions including Simona Halep and Sofia Kenin where as Emma didn't have to face a single Top 10 player. Of course, she could beat whoever was in front of her but still media has totally ignored Iga.
Same Level but Iga outmatched Leylah today. Shall we say it’s Iga’s day. We didn’t see LEylah we saw at the USO. We’ll see at AO22. Congrats 🎊 Iga .. fan of both players😘
ayo lella berlatih lagi yg lebih keras ❤️
iga said she was angry after she found out about Novak visa situation and took it on Fernandez
Too much power
I'm a lefty and root for lefties,  but this was a clinic by Swiatek.  All power to Leylah, but she's not going to sneak up on anybody this year and someone like Iga who has a GS of her own is going to take this pretty seriously like here.  This won't be atypical, Leylah's going to have a rougher year than folks are predicting.
Yikes this may be players figuring out how to beat Leyla   Iga skillfully pulled her wide both directions    She didn’t try and power her off the court which Leyla loves as a really effective deflector.
Wow this is my 2 fovorite idol leylah iga amazing i love both of you guys good lock all win👏👏❤
wonderful full-on asskicking of THE MOST overrated chick out there. i love iga--but any day fernandez loses is a red letter day for me.
Iga with a clinical win!!! This lady is going to go far!!! Keep it up Iga!!!!!!
So where are all the Iga haters out there? Hiding in their underground COVID tunnels?
iga is playing like the true champion she is. She is looking more relax and aggressive on court. I am glad she did some changes in the off season. If she stays focus, she is going to raise a couple of slam trophies this year for sure. Lobs and drop shots are also coming back, versatility is the key.
Don't normally see Leylah dominated like that.  Iga when right is very hard to beat.
This, on paper, was a mouthwatering matchup... but mean Iga doesnt want to share the fun!!  😋. Anyways, it seems that she really won the match and Leyla didn´t loose it.  I dont know why the dinamics of this match reminded me of the Rios - Safin matchup back in the day:  beautiful crafty points, a few of them won majestically by Rios but the control of the whole match was never in doubt and was almost allways on Safin´s side, is like Rios met a just as talented but twice as big and powerful player than him.    So, may be a diferent story for this two ultralikeable players with great present and AMAZING future but the way the points presented it seems that Leyla will really have to figure out Iga in order to play a competitive march against her...   here wishing really hard she will.
They should have BOYCOTTED this  fascist, tyrannical country - as should we ALL!
Good game, Iga. My girl, Leylah, please keep your head up. KEEP training and never slow down. Keep challenging yourself. You can do wonders eventually, even though you may lose overall to get there, but you have many years left. Never stop, baby girl.
Fernandez has lots of potential, but Swiatek is just more experienced and just too good
Only if Fernandez were taller as rest of the players
Iga looked good today.  Fernandez's serve requires a lot of work though.  Practically all of her service games had break point opportunities in them.
Leylah has no physical weapons in her game, just a good fighting spirit and never-say-die attitude. She needs to develop a stronger serve and maybe a more potent net game. Swiatek has a stronger all-round game, which explains why she’s already a Grand Slam champion.
Two of my favorite players.  Good experience for Leylah.  Iga was too good today.
Brawo Iga świetny mecz. Oby tak dalej.
Great match IGA
If this was Emma, you toxic Leylah fans would've been bashing her just like every other video.
Wow, that was a beatdown. Congratulations Iga. She is so dangerous when she is focused
What an easy win from Ida,… unbelievable,… Leylah was out for sure,… 👏✌️👍🙏😎
Fernandez = One hit wonder like so often in WTA Tennis😂
Back to reality.
Leylah is only good with a crowd.
Iga was almost flawless ngl not really much Leylah could do today but tip your cap
Better luck next time Leylah
I hope Leylah would just focus on her singles, no doubles for now..she looked tired in Indian wells.
emma didnt win against iga... no doubt LF wont win over iga
Great win from Iga!! Putting this overhyped player in her place!! Better player won!
Would’ve been different if she had played the same in round 1. Committed 5 df on this game and not moving in the court that much but its fine great match, still for leylah. Iga played so well today..next is at Sidney wta 500. Goodluck on ur doubles later Leylah!.. congrats Iga.. fan of both ❤️
Women's tennis has really kicked it up a notch past few years especially 2021
Two of my favorite players. Sorry to see Leylah go. Iga starting the season in good shape.
Leylah...😞
Good match.
2 one-trick ponies. One was better. Next? Real mares like barty.
Leylah is at the stage Swiatek was at when she was 19. She's on track to be a top player. Swiatek is a level above Fernandez right now, very strong and will get better, probably winning a few more majors. Fernandez will be there in two years.
Funny how someone said Fernandez will destroy Swiatek
Man.  That was an impressive performance by Iga today.  Thought it would be a lot closer.  New coach could be key to taking her to next level??
Iga reminding Leylah that there are levels to this game.
Iga crushed Leylah, Iga is 100% better than either Leylah and Emma when fit. Iga crushed both when she was a junior as well.
If this was Emma people would be trash talking her so bad! -_-
Iga keep improving loved your determination . And leylah good luck for next match .
Congrats, Iga!
Why Iga won? Unexpected down the line shot!
Vi a Swiatek muy superior a Fernandez. Pense que estaban mas igualadas. Aunque vi a Fernandez llevarse la mano a la espalda en varias ocasiones. Tal vez sea una lesion.
I was told by the media that Raducanu and Fernandez were going win everything for the next ten years?🤔
Leylah, will still be rooting for you in AO Slam
Love the 🔥 in Leylah's eyes... She hates losing and you can tell those practice courts aren't safe💪🏽
Gran partido
Iga always hit the ball high cuz Leylah is petite, that's her weakness.
Iga ją po prostu zmiotła z kortu, z Azarenka będzie o wiele trudniej ale wierzę że da radę,powodzenia
Iga pełna kontrola co powiedzieć więcej .Dziękujemy !!! Jak był USO kibicowałem Fernandez i uważam że ten tytuł powinien należeć do niej .Dzisiaj Iga pozamiatała trzymam kciuki niech obroni ten tytuł, napewno łatwo nie będzie ale dzisiaj grała swobodnie, pewnie tak trzymać .🎾🏃🏆♕🎾
請問一下、有人懂中文嗎？ 這是什麼比賽～？ 粉色的打者、是那個國籍？ 能告訴我打者的稱呼嗎？ 我覺得她打的很棒～ 有看到（喬克維奇）的影子～ 未來一定在（四大公開賽）～ 一定會有很好的成績～
Fernandez is great at returning the ball, so it is important to play the ball behind her a lot. If only Sabalenka had realised that, she would probably be the US Open champion.
Leylah outmatched today. Iga anticipated Leylah's shots and was rarely out of position.
2 aces, 0 df, 30 winners, 8 ue  she smashed
Bravo Iga. Greetings from Toronto.
Playing Leylah is like playing against a wall. She hits the ball back as early as she can and tries to get every ball in. Unfortunately Swiatek is a higher level player for her. Only the best Top 10 beat Iga for the most part.
Layla couldn’t play her game…. Iga didn’t allow her to spread her wings…  Azarenka, you next
Swiantek's skills could beat a Leylah.  It showed right here.
Swiatek is like a female version of Sinner lol
gratuluję
This really showed Leylah’ lack of experience still. Iga seemed so relaxed and just kept returning all the balls until Leylah made a mistake. Leylah could’ve kept the match closer but she just lacked the experience. She’ll come back stronger
Brawo Iga jedziesz z nimi
Iga went off in this match. I think she is a good contender to take this title like she did last year
Swiatek has a lot of resources, when she wants to put on a show, she gives
Leylah has the fire and grit... LovE HER
Cold shower and tenis lesson for Leylah
