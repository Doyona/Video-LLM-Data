I think most people are missing the point to this post. My issue isn’t a replacement drummer as much as the fact that they took out an ad during the Super Bowl to promote a gig that one of the four members is not going to play. This extended video ad shows all these new fans (and one old one) to U2 that are desperate to hear the Achtung Baby record. If it’s so important for these “new fans” to hear, U2 play this particular record, isn’t it important to include all the original band members? Is this something that could’ve been advertised on U2.com and not the biggest sporting event in the US? Bands replace members or have musicians fill in all the time but they don’t advertise these gigs on the Super Bowl. As a long time, U2 fan, I thought it was an odd move. Larry is the driving force behind the band. The were a stadium band because of him.
Your point is very truly. But I have been thinking about the time, the clock is click click, click, Larry is not feeling good to play, but the rest of the members are still strong enough to mak a gig (but for how much time?), the Bono's eyes continue getting worse. Yes maybe and surely is about the money, but I think is about continue doing what You know to do, and the best way You can, This venue is awesome and gave them a chance to innovate, so... 3/4 of a total is a good deal for the fans!
Larry dah to do back surgery while they did shows at the sphere thats why they had to replace him for a bit
I saw them in 1987 on the original joshua tree tour. Tickets were 20 bucks
I heard the gig's were amazing............just say'n.
Appreciate Rick for the call out
He had both shoulders operated on
If it would have been a regular tour they would have postponed like they did in 2010 when Bono was injured. The fact is that the sphere wanted the greatest live act of all time for the opening of that revolutionary venue. Which is 100% natural. The band couldn't let it slip away. It's like a sport team. Do you lose the finals just because one of your players is injured? You'll try to replace him and win anyway. Show must go on.
I saw them at the Sphere. It was awesome.
Totally agree.  They’re just not as good anymore.  Haven’t been for some time to be fair.
Rick, the sad truth is that U2 have been losing it since the early 2000s and have mostly been a money-printing machine after they gave up their artistic integrity when the masses couldn't handle Pop and Popmart
I travelled from Chile to Las Vegas, and I have seen U2 4 times live. Fully understanding LMJ and his back issues, however, as a live show, I think this was one of the best performances of U2 since the Zooropa tour/Joshua Tree tour. Good to hear LMJ is better, can't wait for the new music.
What about when David Gilmour and Nick Mason filled stadiums in 1987-1989 under the name 'Pink Floyd' without Roger Waters (the guy who wrote ALL the band's hits) and Rick Wright as a session musician...? They announced themselves as 'Pink Floyd', just as they did in 1994, when they let Wright be officially part of the band because it looked better that way...
Without Larry, it's not U2, its U1.5
Drummers are athletes as much as they're musicians.
Bro this post is so irrelevant
what to say man, then ACDC must be shutdown 40 years ago, Stones the same, not to mention this ´´small´´ groups who change more stuff then in NHL teams.
Rattle & Hum (record) should have been (in this order): 1. Desire 2. Angel Of Harlem 3. Heartland 4. Hawkmoon 269 5. Love Rescue Me 6. Van Diemens Land 7. God Part II 8. When Love Comes To Town 9. All I Want Is You   A 5 Star U2 Masterpiece; they should have left the mix of the live songs / new songs just for the movie.
Just saw this for the first time and it certainly didn’t age well.  Bringing up The Beatles & The Police doesn’t work as U2 has never had the conflict & drama those bands were famous for. I can’t think of another band who has remotely come close to the longevity with an original lineup as U2 has had.
Update: Larry's back!
Wasn’t the whole thing because The Sphere only opens ONCE? You know they wanted Larry with them MORE THAN ANYONE…but it’s only the opening band of the Sphere once? Unless I’m wrong and another band had already played.
I just saw this today and well it did not age well LOL  Larry is back and was totally supportive of his sit in drummer.
I saw the show twice at The Sphere, early during the residency and then just before the end, and loved both performances. All 40 shows during the residency were sold out. If you're a fan like you say, then I assume you went to see them there. If you did, what is your opinion now?
Totally agreee! I used to be a huge fan. I cried when I first heard Ruttle&Hum, I took it as a betray. But then a totally appriciate it. They reached their best with Acthung Baby. Then personally Grunge took place and so I changed listenings. I still remeber U2 at Stadio Flaminio in Rome with Pearl Jam as support!!!!! And hearing their production after 95, I didn't miss much!
I missed zoo tv because they didn’t came to South America. The Las Vegas show was my chance to see the album fully played. I am a u2 fan since I was 13 years old; I knew them from the Joshua tree and I HATE, ABSOLUTELY HATE gatekeeping from new or other fans that haven’t seen the band.  If Larry agreed on the situation, how dare us to critizice it? If you didn’t like it, don’t pay, don’t go and that’s it.  I was so HAPPY, my dad just passed in 2023, I went with my daughter of 15 yo, we bonded, she had the 90’s aesthetic with the expo and I touched a trabant.  You are a great musician, but gatekeeping is so horrible. Think on people that didn’t watched the Super Bowl, Americans are not the only U2 fans.   This attitude really annoys me.
Saw them in LV and while it was disappointing to not see Larry Mullin jr, but they still rocked it.  Not knowing whether I'd get to ever see U2 live ever again, it was worth it.  The effects in the sphere only enhanced the experience.
2 year old video, still interesting.
I am a young person. U2 is my favorite band. I went to the sphere by myself. A religious experience, and my first time seeing U2. Zoo TV best tour of all time. Young U2 fans exist, interestingly.
The Police at the Sphere without Stewart Copeland,that is not the Police. I would be very disapointed.
Just looked this up and Larry on Drum world or drummers world said he backed out of the residency to get the much needed surgery.
You don't think that by the time Larry was injured that their contract wouldn't let them out?
BRAM ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Call me what you eill , but U2 lost me at The Joshua Tree .
They're not U2 without Larry. It's symbolic: Even if they had to risk being sued whatever, it goes beyond money. It's like Zeppelin or the Who or R.E.M. where all members are crucial. You have bands like the Cure, whereas long as Robert and Simon are there, okay, but U2 can only be those four guys....
The Apple ITunes album sucked, and I am a tremendous U2 fan.
In their retirement they have moved to Las Vegas and have become Wayne Newton.
Came across this and it’s amazing how poorly it has aged. I went, and I can say Sphere was the show, not the band or the album, and many bands would have done it if they could. It  is a place that is so mind blowing it’s almost hard to describe. I do think U2 should ramp it down, but they made around 4 million dollars a night to show off that unbelievable space with an unbelievable record. Rick just didn’t grasp what it really was. A money grab, but one worth seeing.
This video popped up on my channel & it made me think….did you per chance get to any of the 40 shows?? I would enjoy your take on the Sphere. I saw a U2 show in October & went back in Feb cuz my mind was literally blown away by the SOUND. The visuals are incredible but the audio is beyond imagination. As a 65 y/o concert goer I wanted to be there for this & it was WORTHY!! (I live on the East coast so it was a trip). U2 loves cutting edge tech (no pun intended) & this was right in their wheelhouse. Love your vids Rick!!
The show"conpensation" must go on, a friend fills in at a bad sounding system .   The guys are taking care of themselves. Whatever
I agree with this. U2 peaked in 91-92. "Numb" is the only song post-Achtung Baby worth mentioning (a pretty awesome song at that), rest of the stuff is pretty forgettable, some downright embarrassing. Just my opinion at least. Know when to hang it up!
I can't believe some people think Rattle and Hum was a misstep!?! I love that album
It's called money, silly.
I have seen the Rattle and Hum movie and they were great!
Larry’s my hero no Larry no u3 and bono needs to make new friends fast Rick you Rock 👍😎
After "All That You Can Leave Behind" (the last rests of creative juices after the superalbum Zooropa)this band must have make a bow and call to retirement with pride, grace and honour. Their subsequent albums are a sophomore lethany with maybe 1 hit per album, a Bono Vox unable to end his phrases live,  with total absence of that vibrato, harmonics and passion from the past. Last time I saw them live was the 360 Tour on Berlin and besides the hiper realistic visuals the vocal performance was lame, The Edge save the night with his vocals. I saw a pair videos here from that sphere and they makes mammoth efforts to destroy their own glory and legacy to be honest. But well, the tickets are there, the people buy them and the business go round........
I miss Paul McGuiness.
They should have hired Robbie Mullen , look him up. He plats exactly like Larry.
Paul Mcginnis was the 5th member of U2 and they fired him.
U2! Now this is the name I haven't been thinking of for like 25 years! I can't believe they are still actually playing live and even existing! To me they kinda disappeared into a wormhole after POP world tour.
As usual, some very astute analysis of a classic album!
REMEMBER PETE BEST!!!
No member of U2 can be replaced. All four work together to support the weaknesses of their band mates. It's a rare chemistry that if broken the entire band suffers. It only took one bar for me to know Larry wasn't the one drumming.
I totally agree with you. Something wrong is happening with the band. It’s sad but true.
I saw the show in Vegas.. It was amazing top four shows I've ever seen.
Maybe Larry asked if this was actually going ahead and the reply was "With or Without You"?
@RickBeato Larry said he needed a break as all his medical issues over 40 years had caught with him. Which is fair enough he is only human. He has needed injections in his arm for years to keep it working properly. He was quite happy to watch from the audience.
This video to me was your big miss step
Totally agree with you Rick. Achtung Baby is such a monumental album, drum wise, I was shocked at them agreeing to the residency without Larry. Bram appears to be a great drummer and having watched a lot of the footage from the Sphere gigs I must take my hat off to him. That being said, I'm sure he would be the first person to say he is not Larry. Not in terms of ability but more so lacking Larry's quirks. Some points watching the footage you can almost kind of forget Larry's not there then suddenly you hear something that Larry wouldn't do which, to me, disturbs me from the song. I think U2 are one of very few bands that musically/live can match whatever art you put on the screens and Achtung Baby is just the perfect album for this immersive experience. But without Larry.....? Fair play to Bram Larry get well soon
Your Buddy Rich?
As Bob Dylan said, when you make a deal the chief commander 😈, you are forever paying back your side.  They look like old women
Like a lot of the comments here, It's not U2 without Larry. I believe this Las Vegas residency had to go ahead due to contractual obligations, something had originally been planned I think for 2021 which would be the 3oth anniversary of Achtung Baby, but of course Covid cancelled that. I think if they had waited any longer the whole AB anniversary would have passed, it was just unfortunate that it clashed with Larry's impending back surgery.
U2 is four men: Bono, The Edge, Adam, and Larry. The end.
I felt the same way until I heard "Atomic City."   It reassured me that Larry really was coming back and I completely changed my mind on the Sphere shows.   The shows were amazing. You shoulda gone.
I completely agree with you!
Rick, a huge respect to you for your opinion. I'm 53 and I'd been their huge fan up to No Line On The Horizon cos next albums were simply .... not gonna end😂. And their latest idea of replacing Larry is the same, you know what I mean?
I'm sure they were already committed to doing the show before Larry was injured. While I don't agree that they should call it a day if they are all still motivated to continue, given they are now well into their sixties, they should maybe think a bit more about getting into such long term contracts.
Larry was sick, and his drum Tech stood in for him, because Larry had taught him all the riffs/songs. That’s what Bono wrote about the problem.
They had a monumental run at the sphere grossing a 1/4 of a billion dollars and considered a monumental residency.  So it looks like the joke is on you Rick Beato. Lol
The contract probably allowed for not doing the shows in the event of a health issue. They have enough money and Bono lost his voice and swagger years ago. They should have retired around 2010.
U2 has become plastic and pompous, I stopped listening to them after No Line On The Horizon. Their music after that album is lame and lacks passion.
They were thinking our drummer needs to have an operation so he can't play for a long time, let's replace him temporally. Like the did Bono (with Chris Martin) in December 2014 due to a cycling accident.
A year later, remembering the talk at the time. I didnt like the show v a concert. I thought perhaps U2 couldn't get out of it without getting sued. Nothing else makes any sense. The Rolling Stones are a different breed.  Keith will till he drops on stage.Maybe Mick Jagger too. keiths blues heros played till they dropped. U2 i wish they did a Beatles Led Zep ( Robert Plant )option quit. I like u2 i dont love them.
I'm a huge U2 fan too and after watching a few Sphere Shows on YT, despite the fact nobody can beat Larry and Achtung Baby is all about the drums....the most bizarre thing is that....I think it totally worked !
They played without an original band member before, in 1993, when Adam was too drunk to play. They played on anyway with his guitar technician on bass because they were contractually obligated to play, and, as the old saying goes, “The Show Must Go On.” You don’t let your fans down once you’re committed to something people have bought tickets for already, and especially if you know you can fulfill your commitments if you really want to. I don’t see much of a difference/issue here other than that Larry couldn’t do it for health reasons beyond his control (rather than someone voluntarily getting too drunk) which is surely the more easily forgivable of the two reasons for not being there; both for himself and the rest of the band, who were commited to launching the most spectacular music venue ever built anywhere. The contract MUST have already been signed before the super bowl ad (which all of the World’s international non-USA fans like me didn’t even see, know or care about anyway; there’s a whole big world out there) but we all travelled a very long way to enjoy it, and we turned up in our thousands anyway. So what are the band supposed to do in the face of this demand having already made a commitment? Quit? The Sphere show was a great success, and they were the ideal band to open the venue (making a BIG sound to match the scale of venue feel somehow personal and intimate at the same time? yes, U2). Larry gave Bram his blessing and the ‘rightness’ of that decision, morally, is between themselves as far as I’m concerned. I’ve no reason to doubt their integrity.
You are understating the health issues Larry has. He needed to take a long break and physical therapy.
It's all about one thing & one thing only .......... MONEY! ....... The Sphere is a new venture & if they didn't do it, someone else would ha e stepped in & done it!! The amount of money they were being paid to have a residency there was astronomical & in the same ad where you have all the different aged fans, Bono's actual words were 'We'd be mad not to do it'!! ......... Says it all ....... Ker-ching! 🤑🤑🤑
Just now found this...I was also not ok with U2 without Larry. I considered selling my epic U2 collection to go, but in the end, I just couldn't do it. Not without Larry.  That's just not U2.
Some people says the 40 concerts its the opinion of the fans. They are  right. The pay and thats all.  But not me.
My introduction to U2 was the Joshua Tree album in '87. Still my favorite Album ever.
Not sure what the fuss is here.  1. They had a commitment to play, hard to change contracts like this. 2. LMJ couldn’t make it but gave his blessing for a replacement. 3. The band announced long in advance that LMJ couldn’t join and there would be a replacement drummer, so no surprises. 4. If you don’t want to see U2 without LMJ, then don’t buy a ticket. 5. In the end Bram did a great job, showing that the band selected their drummer wisely, probably with input from Larry. Hopefully Larry recovers quickly and will be back for the next album/tour.  Honestly, how many bands haven’t had to temporarily replace a band member, especially for live gigs. And some bands permanently replace band members (Rolling Stones, AC/DC, even Queen is trying to continue without Freddie).
To be brutally honest with you Rick I don't really see what the point of your post is. I'm sure the four of them would have got together and discussed this at length and Larry has given Bram the go ahead  to step into his shoes as it were and give the skins a good hiding for 40 nights  and of course the rest is history.
I saw them live in 1980, and live again on the Zooropa tour 1993 so I guess you could say I’ve followed them for a long time. I’ve only seen recordings of the sphere shows but on the face of it they were on the money, I’m the same age as Bono unfortunately things change as age creeps in and adjustments are sometimes required……
There was the one time Chris Martin filled in for Bono.
3 things  1. The show was amazing and Bram did a great job.  2. I’m a young U2 fan since 2010 (I’m 26 now) and I gotta say I always like Actung baby, but fell in love with it after seeing them twice in the sphere. 3. If you didn’t go see them only because Larry wasn’t there, you made a big mistake.
RICK got the wrong end of the STICK 😂
Bono is a bozo one of the most overated guitar players ever do not get it and I know I am not alone here.
Interested to know if you actually went to one of the Sphere gigs? While I understand your point about Larry, I am pleased the other members of the band (with larry's blessing) took the opportunity to launch the revolutionary musical epic that is that venue. I did not go, I live in New Zealand and had no idea it was even happening until it stopped happening but after seeing just the youtube videos of the performances and hearing The Edge talk about the venue in a few mini-docos I can tell it was a truly u2 thing to do. I may never bother to go to a sport field venue for a music event ever again.
U2 Yuk !
Didn't U2 do a show on TV with Chris Martin from Coldplay filling in for Bono? I don't remember anyone in an uproar over that.
This video has not aged well. Their residency was a success, once again they are at the forefront of shows. And they couldn't stop doing it even if Larry had a bad back.
U2 sucked starting in the 90's
apparently the name of the band u2 stands for the untalented two that bono and edge called the other two bandmates.
Has Bono saved the world yet?
Your analysis is very sensible (and by the way, I've just read your post about the Superbowl ad being, let's say ... almost indecent), but I think there's one thing missing : Is Larry going to / intending to ever come back into the band ? He probably will since he had surgery, so they thought playing Achtung Baby without him for once wan't such a big deal. Now if (O what a sorrowful IF) Larry failed to resume his rightful place in the band, we might call it the end of U2, whatever the other three decided to do. But if he does come back as we all hope and think he will, they are well capable of churning out another  dozen well-crafted, well-engineered albums ... without the energy - without the soul - they instilled into the first 6 albums anyway.
Pure greed. Bono’s Trough will never be full enough. 🐷💰💰💰💰
Cheap trick did it with Bun. Aerosmith did it kiss did it.
This didn’t age well
I would never ever pay to see a U2 concert without Larry. I don’t buy Bono’s explanations. I think after this residency, which was a total sell out, they’re done. And if not, they should be. Turns out Mullen has started an acting career. Is that a coincidence? Maybe, maybe not.
How has this aged?
Well, like the rest of the world in business reacts these days, it's all about one thing & one thing only & that's the money plus they probably didn't want to miss out the chance to be the first band to christen the sphere ...... I was initially gutted about Larry but Bram did a cracking job & it wasn't going to affect me because I couldn't afford tickets for the Sphere so why worry about it! I just hope they tour Europe & I pray Larry makes a full recovery because that's most important to me 🙏❤️
I too have been listening from the beginning,  as soon as was available to U.S. Sidebar first 4 albums the best. I also appreciate rattle and hum. But I couldn't agree with you more. First 3 were the VERY BEST.
Having seen Larry play at every gig we've been to since Joshua Tree at Wembley in 1987, his absence was weird. That said, our night at the Sphere was incredible and Bram did a brilliant job. The aspect of that venue I didn't like was the large amount of casual fans who didn't even know the words to a lot of the songs. When Bono held the mic up to the audience to sing along to One, the silence was embarrasing. I've seen Fat Elvis on the Strip get more audience involvement. Listening to a group of very well heeled 40 somethings talk about the show as we walked back to our hotel, it was clear for them it was just another night out in Vegas. When one of the ladies asked the group which was their favourite song, one shouted 'Sunday Sunday' while another admitted that she didn't know any of the song titles. This would not have been any different - with or without Larry.
I originally thought doing the Vegas shows without Larry was a terrible idea.  Since then I've seen some of the video footage from those shows and it looked and sounded amazing.  This is something that took a few years to prepare for, so I can see why they couldn't postpone.  Bran was a very capable replacement drummer for these shows.  The fans that attended the Vegas shows looked like they enjoyed and had a good time.  I had my doubts, but I was very impressed with how things turned out.  Having Larry in the audience the 2nd last show and saluting him was a nice touch.  Rick, keep posting these great videos.
Rick, love ya truly, but how quickly you forgot the Rolling Stones... *Same* band members for *60* years, still touring, except for their drummer who had to be, a-hem, permanently "replaced". R.I.P. Charlie Watts...but the show must go on.  U2 absolutely nailed their residency at The Sphere with their phenomenal sub! And all respect was given, including a standing ovation, to Larry Mullen, Jr. who was in the audience 😉
In my opinion, if Journey can keep on rocking with a new frontman (who does a really good Steve Perry, btw), than why can't U2 keep rocking with a replacement drummer? People get sick... people get old. But the music is timeless. How many replacements has Alice Cooper had over the years?
Care to issue a follow up and or retraction?
Most overrated band in the world
IMO "Gloria" is their best song.  It's so rocky...  but it makes sense. And their worst album is "Achtung Baby".  It's too industrial.  I did see the Zoo tour.  It was ok.  I know.  People like Achtung Baby.  I can't stand that record.  When Achtung Baby was released, my friend, Floyd made fun of me.  Why?  Because I said that the best song on that record is "Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses".  That's how bad that record is.
U2 should have retired in 1976
Well, this hasn't aged well.  I had assumed for decades that the best U2 concert (and best concert) I would ever see was Joshua Tree (original recipe). I figured that nostalgia had it firmly secure at #1 no matter what else I ever saw. Yeah, well... U2 at the Sphere was mind blowing. I DO wish Larry could have done even one show (he did manage to record the drums for Atomic City) - I do feel like something was missing spiritually. But on the Night Bram(?) practically made me forget that Larry wasn't there.  This is hardly a "bad look" take, but it is entirely wrong.
Saw them in 87 on the Joshua Tree Tour. Car Stevens and Los Lobos opened for them. They were so far away I watched the screen on the field. People doing drugs all around me. Not a good time at all!  But I love U2’s music.
U2 biggest sell out band ever
All I know is the British monarchy should've made it crown law that The Stones must disband immediately at the passing of Charlie Watts.  Now they're no different than the KISS cover band playing without Peter and Ace.  I am very passionate about this topic. I'm sure Bram van den Berg is a great drummer, but he is not Larry.  Zeppelin made the right choice!
Rick, have you considered updating your original take on this? 600+ thousand tickets sold
I think Bram is awesome
Nobody cares about Larry dude! All las Vegas concert are sold out! So suck it!
Neither Larry nor Adam are playing  I didn't appreciate all rhw stupid Alluminati signs Bono started throwing out ...such a great band
U2 lost all musical relevance since the 2000. So who cares?
Just came back from seeing U2 at the Sphere, they would’ve been stupid to pass up this show, with or without Larry (see what I did there?). A mind-blowing marriage of music, technology (the sound is incredible) and digital art. A must see.
It's sold so well that they have had to put on extra dates
It was Apple's fault that you couldn't delete it at first
The economics of it all win, maybe? As a long time fan, it just feels weird. What also feels weird is Adam Clayton without his Fender Precision Bass.
Never cared about U2
U2 ARE THE AWESOME 4..💙🎶
Z00 Tv was epic...l still have not found what l am looking for since then.
No Larry at a concert means...it's simple...U2 did not pitch up. INSANE. I tried to watch the concerts at the Sphere...was not the same without Larry.
Black Sabbath without Bill Ward in 2013 (shame),  The Doors without John Densmore (mixed, their issues, Copeland involved),  The Who without Keith Moon (big mistake, sad),  Rolling Stones without Charlie Watts (excusable - they MUST keep on rocking to prove they're the greatest).  LZ - wise decision...  Ian Paice!!!!!   P.S. No Cream without Ginger Baker,  But Band of Gypsies is without Mitch Mitchell... Buddy Miles appears...   Hey! Even Spirit had an album or two without Mr Skin Ed Cassidy! It's ok to me.   P.P.S. John Coltrane at the very end of his career accidentally lost his natural drummer, the greatest Alvin Jones, by hiring the second drummer (as if Elvin's mighty noise wasn't enough for St John...)  King Crimson ended up with three drummers!!!   The Grateful Dead's Mickey Hart's story comes to mind. He had quit because his father stole the band's money for his church needs in 1970.  Mickey returned in 1975 and stayed until the end.   I have no drums on my albums 😢. That's why I'm that much into drummers 😂🎉  Please visit my Bandcamp, it's in the description of my channel ❤
"With or without you...."
What do you think now after the most shows are played? Bram is doing a good job and Mullen will come back for the next album and tour. Tickets are too expensive but I would like to see them in Vegas. But it's not possible because music is not a product. But the show and the music is great performed.
Safe to say this video didn’t age well…
The truth is Larry Mullen Jr is not on board with the politics
I couldn’t afford to see them at first avenue in 1981 or two it’s been a while but I did see them Five more times starting in LA in 1987 and Finally last Wednesday night at the sphere  I imagine they proceeded with Larry’s blessing I’m really glad I got to see them again and to share that with my son was priceless
I'm still scratching my head to why everyone is still blaming the band because an album they simply gave away for free had been ridiculed for so long because "Apple's tech people" made it hard to delete off the phones and yet the company has copped nothing, pathetic.
I figured it was because of the Sphere technology. They either do it now, or someone else does it.
2024.WHO'S STILL A BIG FAN? AFTER ALL THEIR STILL TOGETHER
Almost a year later after this video was made, I'm listening to Mr. Beato rant about how stupid U2 is/was for doing a Vegas residency without Larry Mullen Jr., what a blunder their new manager has made, etc. I wonder what he thinks now that the Sphere is open, and the shows have been blowing the minds of nearly everyone who has experienced it? By the end of 2023, Rick knew that U2 signed a contract 2 years earlier to open the $2.2 billion, one of a kind (for now) building. They were committed. Larry needed surgery. He could not play a show, let alone 22 shows (extended to 40). If I had made this video, I would've removed it at least a couple of months ago. It's embarrassing. (As is his comment that "most people are missing" his point.)
I agree with you, but maybe Larry doesn't want to do anymore gigs.
He still gets a cut. Think of it as Disability Coverage.
Larry wasn’t A founding member, he is THE founding member. My first U2 show was in 1983, about a dozen more throughout the last 40 years, but no Larry is a deal breaker. Read the cheapest seat in that Vegas venue is over $300. Too much for a no Larry show.
This didn’t age well, because a) the show turned out great, b) it’s commonly understood now that the contract predates Larry’s injury and c) the ‘nobody’ is doing fine.
This has aged pretty poorly.  These shows have been amazing. Also U2 did not take out the ad, MSG did as they wanted to promote Sphere.  Reality is bands have contractual obligations to tour. U2 is ultimately managed by Live Nation and they had not played a gig since 2019. They also were asked to open a technological marvel (and it is).    It worked. Extended stay there with every single show sold out.  Has been a massive success for them and gotten them more global attention. They have indicated a new album may be coming later this year with a tour next year and it sounds like Larry will be able to be part of all of that. He did play on Atomic City and I suspect he may be in a good place by the time we get to summer.
Rick is an encyclopedia, exceptionally gifted, hard working and multi  talented. Whether hes' talking about U2 or Bach his take is always amazingly refreshing and enlightening.
I watched some of the Las Vegas gig on UT and I could tell Mullins wasn't on drums! I am 65 and have listened to U2 since they started out 45 years!
Not your best rant.
Never was a U2 fan
Totally agree I think it's time for U2 to  break up. I grew up with them it's time to say goodbye!😢
Queen without Freddy is a deal breaker for me but U2 without Larry Mullen? Once a new drummer settles in even the most ardent U2 fan won't tell the difference unless they're looking at the guy sitting on the throne.
Tim Cook is a complete fool.  Everything he does faills.
Bet Rick feels dumb know long how successful the shows are now
Did you see the show, Rick.  It was a concert of a lifetime.
Haha, nice plot twist in the end, Rick! 😂
They can do what they want. Do you think they won't be warmly received? U2 forever!
U2 have always referred to themselves as “A gang from the north side of Dublin.” What people are seeing in Vagas is not U2. Bono, Edge, and Adam, you have sold out.
You can't spout save the planet and have huge carbon footprint using  private jets , the most polluting form of transport
I tried to watch one of the shows from the sphere . It was crap they should stop now
I think they made a commitment to MSG and Larry could not go and the call to be first at the Sphere was the draw. I saw them at Sphere and Bram I thought was great. I am no music expert and no U2 purist, but they put on a heck of a show in a unique setting and it was great and people loved it.
Nope, not missing the point. Player injured so substitute comes on, does a great job. Player back well again and gets back on the pitch, substitute having done a great job.
40 shows have sold out. The fans have voted with dollars and feet.
Rick, I'm a big fan of your videos and I've learned a lot from watching them. I probably wouldn't have ever listened to Joe Pass if it wasn't for your video on him. I also love the "what makes this song great series."  I play the drums as a hobby and I think the first song I learned to play well was "Sunday Bloody Sunday."  I'm also a huge U2 fan. I've seen them 48 times and was also at Aloha Stadium for the U2 / Pearl Jam show that was epic. I'll never forget watching Eddie Vedder jumping all over the stage with U2 singing "Rocking in the Free World." I've now seen U2 3 times at the Sphere and I have no words to describe what an amazing spectacle it is and the band sounds better than ever. It's like nothing I've seen before and recommend to all that it's a must see. I was also torn about the Larry situation but.... I'm ok with it and actually think that Bram van den Berg is a better drummer than Larry and seems to enjoy himself much more than Larry ever did at a gig that I saw. Larry always looks pissed. Maybe Bono get's under his skin. Bram can play some of the grooves without having to rely on an extra floor tom on his left (I know you and drummers will understand what I mean by this).  I know he formed the band and he'll profit tremendously from the U2 residency and.... he'll be back. At the end of the day, I'm totally ok with it and respectfully agree to disagree with you on this one.  Keep doing your videos!     Rocking in the Free World,   Alberto
Maybe Larry quit
So... That Charlie Watts is no longer playing with the Stones (for whatever reason) means they shouldn't play,?
Very disappointing video, Rick. You’re slowly getting prototypical old man yelling at clouds, with a very possessive attitude towards music. Maybe time to call it quits.
U2 is actung baby.... And thats enough, all after this, is crap.
I admire your sense of loyalty, Rick. You're a great guy.
Look, Larry needed surgey for his forever on going issues it was his choice to have it done then and picked a drummer he's never missed a day of work, it's a "mini" residency  AND Larry is still getting paid for it, Bram is being paid a % from all 4 members,  Don't make such a big deal about it, such drama for a short term and yes I've been a HUGE U2 fan since the Joshua Tree came out, I'm 6 months older than Bono  Stop fueling the fire! It's a phenomenal show!!!!!  And actually, Bono is the driving force of the band, if it wasnt for him U2 wouldn't have the charisma that it does!!!!!
".....Buddy Rich is a huge U2 fan...."  I was like "what??🤨" :DDD   (at 0:53)
Also about Dublin, They do not have street signs like we have in the USA. I really thought the streets have no name until a local pointed out the street signs on the buildings. We were looking to tour a castle and took a few wrong turns. I almost didn't find what I was looking for.
I was in Dublin recently and was so supprised to not see any tribute or mention of U2. We also were in Liverpool and toured the  Beatles museum which was a big deal. I expected to see something like that for U2.
I've heard Larry is having issues with the arm and leg jounts and physically not able to do this concert.
I think that Bram van den Berg has nothing to do with this. If you were a drummer, and U2 would ask you to play gigs with them, would you say, no thank you? Come on... And Bram said, that there is only one Larry Mullen Jr.. So what he did, will do, took a lot of guts, and is fantastic. Look at Bono, Edge, Adam, and Larry. Beause they decide.
Bram first couple of nights had struggles with tempo or following the click. But he settled in and has done a very formidable job. I did not miss Larry and I’m sure Larry coached Bram to do the gig. I’mglad they did the residency in this incredible new venue. I’m sure they missed Larry but it was definitely full blown U2 up on that stage. The only absolutely irreplaceable guys in U2 are Bono and Edge.
U2 has made agreements with Larry to provide a temporary perfect drummer and that is Bram van den Berg. He has already shown it in concerts. So I don't understand what your problem is? Please explain a little better what you bother about that decision you have made to come to this conclusion?
I respectfully disagree.  They are crushing it it Vegas.  Larry recovering from surgery couldn't withstand night after night shows, now they extended the residency.  Bram is an amazing drummer, he fits perfectly.  As Bono says, " I'm still tryin to figure out who this guy is."  You should just relax and enjoy the show.  I am 55 and been with them from the beginning, 15 shows and will go again.  There is no replacing Larry, listen to what he says each night during the show.  Peace
Saw the show a few nights ago: it was stunning. Can understand the disappointment an original member is not there. But opening a brand new other-worldly arena like Sphere was a once in a lifetime opportunity. And to be honest (not being a drummer) I can't tell much of a difference in the sound, at all. You could replace either Larry or Adam and I doubt 95% of people would notice. That;s not a crack on them, but Edge and Bono are the major personality and spirit of what they do. Wouldn't be surprised if Larry and Adam thought the same.
I saw them back in the day Murrayfield Scotland Joshua Tree awesome however Larry not very well and you have to think they must have sat down and spoke about this and it’s they’re decision if we like it or not just like the free album you can choose to go or not what’s more disturbing was Queen irreplaceable Freddy Mercury was replaced major fail
You had better accept, these guys are getting older and will have health issues.  There will need to be temporary people filling in at times. We just lost Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac. People don’t live forever.
Bram van den Berg is a good temporary replacement for Larry who has time to recover properly.
To Rick’s point… a Super Bowl ad was a WAY pompous and unnecessary move. Gotta wonder how much of Bono’s ego was involved in that business choice. I’m a HUGE lifelong fan…. who doesn’t use ITunes on my iPhone… and even I was PISSED when SoI randomly started playing every time I connected my headphones. Point being… 1st band to play the Sphere? Can’t pass that up…even if it means finding a substitute. But I surely won’t go if Larry’s not there. That’s like Primus without Herb…. Still great… but just not the same.
They were obligated and already under contract for the shows.
@rickbeato Hey Rick I travelled from Argentina to see the show and it was the most breathtaking audio visual experience of my life. I'm 40, I'm a fan of u2 but would not consider myself hardcore fan, but I basically like the old records and not much anything after 2000. Anyway, the show brought me to tears and I was wondering if you had the chance to go and what is your reaction. If you didn't, you should, get on a plane
looks like the sold out shows are indicative of the need U2 is satisfying. also sure a contract negotiated a year or two earlier needed to be honored. and worry not, they'll do a world tour starting next summer.
The fact that Larry could not play due to a back injury was made clear well in advance. I found that out on general media. I've been a fan for many decades. As I am a Beatles fan. I was at the sphere the second night. 14 hours travel each ways for a 3 night stay. It was great beyond belief, without Larry who was badly missed. Bram van den Berg was superb ! As a bass player myself have loads of respect how he gelled with Adam, which must have been a big ask. During the gig they threw a song at him he had not rehearsed to keep him on his toes. It was raw. Just brilliant. Bram van den Berg is not Larry and will never replace him, but give him credit. He was playing in front of the most amazing spolight I've ever seen.... Respect for Bram van den Berg
I love Larry's playing. He is an inspiration to my playing. I am not interested in the business of U2...only the music. ♪♫♪ I just checked out this video to see if Larry is okay.
Bram is doing very well in U2. And that for an ordinary Dutch boy who plays drums in the Dutch band Krezip. But he does it anyway with U2!!
He has a very good substitute, Bram V.d. Berg is a great drummer!
Let’s talk about Foo Fighters and their unexpected album and tour when it’s not even a year after Taylor death...
I was a fan since 6 grade 1983 now im disgusted that sold out to corporate America
Couldn’t disagree with this whole video more.
Bram van den Berg is a beast behind the kit
Mount Temple. There’s no point taking anything that you say seriously if you can’t even get your facts straight. Given your high amount of followers, wouldn’t you agree that you have a responsibility to be accurate with what you post?
I had not seen this video, but Rick, you were a little too emotional about this, they were contractually obligated to do it, that show was a MASSIVE investment and they simply had to do it, no way out, and well, there was no way you could've know this 8 months ago, but now that they have started their residency, the show is fantastic according to every review, so that little idea you had there of them breaking up was not your brightest moment, U2 can still perform at their top level, Bono and the guys sound amazing. Love your channle btw.
Go see the show in Vegas and get back to us. It is incredible. Was I a little bummed Larry wasn't behind the kit? Sure.
People humiliate and embarrass themselves for money all the time, nothing usual or shocking about it.
Totally agree, larry should always be in the drum seat..Period..
>Boom<  Well said, Rick.  Personally, I think the world could/would have waited until Larry was healthy.  Someone was probably in their ear saying 'U2 should open the joint' and the band couldn't resist temptation.  But, Vegas is for gamblers.....  🙂 - U2 fan since 1980.
No Larry? How?
Larry is out due to an operation I believe and recovering
You were so wrong about this and have seen the show 3 times. Excellent
I kinda think the contracts were signed before Larry’s surgery.! The show must go on…….the show at the sphere was awesome.
*LEAVE U2 ALONE*
At what point is enough enough? NOT YET FOR U2!!!!! Catch the wave . . .
Best show I have ever seen- October 25, 2023 at the Sphere. it was almost worth getting COVID for.
You don't think Larry isn't getting PAID for the sphere gig?  He's making money while taking time off.
So Rick, have you changed your mind.  The sphere residency is going fine, no?
Heh Rick, Im pretty damn sure that it is because they get to open The Sphere.  If you haven't checked it out, The Sphere is by far the best ever Music Venue ever.  So U2 got to open The Sphere, which is massive. That opportunity won't ever come along again.
That's an A-rated kick in the balls of Larry. It's about sorting in a band who is vital and who could be exchanged. That's a point for a newbie band, but not for U2. Thats a fire. It doesnt matter if Larry may have agreed or not. It's  a matter of holding together. They should have canceled the gig and transmit the human message: Stand together. Missed chance.
Heh Rick,   I saw U2 live a few times. One time I saw them on the 1st night of Zoo TV Tour in 1993. Lineup was Bono, The Edge, Stuart Morgan, & Larry Mullen Jnr.  It was the 26th the night they were supposed to be doing the Zoo TV Video, however they pushed that back to the 27th. Maybe they used footage from the 26th, but minus any Bass Guitarist.  They were pretty coy about it, & Stuart Morgan played brilliantly or perfectly. Most People in the stadium had no idea. They did not use the spotlight on Stuart. Although I knew, so did the People around me. * I was right up front, 2nd row of compressed People right in front of Stuart Morgan, & had I been further back I would of had no idea. Also I only knew it was Stuart Morgan a few years latter. I knew it was someone different, just I didn't know who, until researching it years latter.
Have you now seen the replacement drummer? What's your comment now?
Hey even the Beatles had a replacement drummer when Ringo got sick. Larry will be back, but there are some bands I wish would just hang it up and let younger bands get the chance to tour.
salty dog
Wow I didn’t know you were such big a U2 fan 🤘
went to 2 the U2 Sphere shows with Bram on drugs. best concert experiences of my life! missed LMJ but Bram was fun to watch honestly
well, that didnt age well
Lead time and logistics are hard. The cost and planning inertia to stop it was way too high.  Drummer FWIW seems fine.  The sphere is the main star anyway.
‘Some fill in drummer’ damn show some respect old man. You can’t talk about people like that just because you don’t like it. Be happy they are doing shows and don’t take it for granted. Old folks like you really have no chill. Don’t act elitist and step back in line…
I just returned from this show and thoroughly enjoyed it, as has pretty much everyone whose seen it. As a long time fan of the band (since War), I never give up the opportunity to see them live one more time, because you never know when it will be the last. I saw Rush, Clockwork Angels, but didn't make the effort to see R40. I'm kicking myself now. I also fulfilled a lifelong dream to see Joe Strummer live with Mescaleros. Was it Joe with The Clash? No, a completely new but amazing group of of largely unknown (unknown to me at least) musicians who "got" Joe. It was in a small club in Toronto, with a few thousand people, but Joe and the band were cooking. A month later, he died. So treat yourself and see U2 one more time, because you never know if it will be the last time.
Don't become a grumpy old man, Rick. Please. Don't drag in the iTunes album, it's got nothing to do with the choice to do the residency with a replacement drummer. If Bram van den Berg was doing a bad job at it, fine, but I've not heard comments like that, so give Larry a break (it's his first time missing out), give Bram a break (what an occasion to rise to!) and give the rest of the band a break. We've enjoyed their music too much over the years to start nagging about a one-off replacement drummer
I think as bands age you have to be realistic that some members may not be able to continue due to health problems. I saw U2 live 30 yrs ago in Montreal and I'm seeing them in December in Vegas. I'm not sure my health can wait much longer to hear Actung Baby live one last time. Look at ACDC--that window is closed. I'm grateful U2 is giving us this gift--Bono won't be singing for 2+ hours when he is 70 in just a few years.
I'm guessing this video isn't aging well.
U2 ...since and including "New Line..." are just SH*T! And I was a diehard fan since WAR and absolutely defended them against everything! But I can't anymore! It is just horrific! And "Song os surrender" is an abomination!
Why is it hard to believe there are young fans of Achtung Baby???
He’s had a couple of surgeries… it’s not permanent.
THEY'RE NOT REPLACING LMJ! HE NEEDED SURGERY! CHILL BRO!!!
I saw U2 at the Sphere last week.  Visually it was pretty amazing.  However I wasn't impressed with the audio.  It felt way too processed.  Not to mention they did the show w/ out the original drummer (Larry Mullen).  :-/
Bono said himself in an interview that Larry junior was injured and that's why he wasn't there.  That's all no big drama..
Anyone else think that LM jnr just couldn’t bring himself to spend THAT much time in close proximity to Bono’s ego.
I'm glad I saw ZooTV back in the day. At 15 I could afford a U2 show, at 48 and a career, I'm too poor.
oohhh - Come to the light, Rick! Come join us on the other side where we can see how overrated U2 is and always has been and how full of themselves they are and always have been. Don't just blame their manager - U2 has ALWAYS surrounded themselves with "yes" men....they chose their manager and they chose someone who would say "yes" and help them achieve their financial and political aspirations. u2 is a cog in the machine.
Actung Baby is amazing…
Go see show and you'll change your tun e like a friend of mine did. Unbelievable  show and venue.
Sir.. luv your content and honesty. I also actually somewhat agreed with pieces of what you said here , back when I listened to it 7 months ago but… .. after just watching U2 at the Sphere, it’s time for you to acknowledge this aged poorly and that the band made a great decision. Groundbreaking and the perfect marriage…  I’ve been to 15 U2 gigs, all yours since 97 and this was the best
Rick, love and respect your channel, and of course have subscribed.  That said, we're similar in age, I'm 60, and have been a huge U2 fan since 1983 when I first heard New Years Day, and then the entire War album, and I was hooked ever since.  Hard to remember that long ago, but probably liked them even before then when I first saw them on MTV, probably Gloria from October.  And I saw them live in 1987 on the Joshua Tree tour.  But anyway, I'm not one to support some of their decisions.  I hated when they picked on Trump, not being US citizens, and then later when they promoted abortion for Ireland, as I hate when artists and sports get involved in politics.  Just play your music or play your sport and let me enjoy the escape from politics.  So, I am critical of them at times, but in this case I get your point, but sort of understand their point as well.  They love performing, and hadn't performed in 4 years.  That's a long time.  And I'm sure they had Larry's blessing, and this is just temporary until Larry is better.  So not a big deal to me.  Just my 2 cents worth.  Much respect, and keep on rocking in the free world.
arrogance!
Its not a big deal
i think you're forgetting larry mullin chose this lol.. he's making millions and gave the ok for them to play without him. This is pretty obvious
Since im visiting Vegas, drove past the Sphere the other evening.  When my friend told me that U2 were playing and have a residency here, i was like.. "i want to go see them!" but now on hearing that Larry is not performing with them? Nah, i'll give it a miss. Not the same without him. Will just take a look on youtube, cos i want to see the interior of the Sphere, looks absolutely amazing!!
Good point Rick!!! Larry is a pivotal member as others are in  U2, any of the musicians of U2 are "IRREPLACEABLE"!
U2 were contractually obligated to open Sphere and once it was determined Larry Mullen Jr. needed surgery and couldn't perform, U2 could not get out of the contract, so they had no choice.  I believe, the manager who negotiated the contract, is no longer the manager of U2.
Changed your mind yet
True honest practical question is; how many of you are willing to give up all the ZILIONS of Dollars U2 is receiving for those 25 gigs? Don´t be hypocrites. Literally ZERO people would give up all those hundreds of moneys deposit in their bank account, Larry Mullen Jr. included. Period.  The Sphere Entertainment Company had a deadline to open the venue, or risk bankrupting even before opening, and they still are at high risk, no matter their stocks made a 11% increase in the market. Ask Real Estate Investment Trust people. U2 accepted the deal and its date, with the acceptance of Larry Mullen Jr. as well.  It´s a pity for us that Larry couldn´t be at the gig, health issues. But that´s not the end of the world.  Larry is, and will always be, U2 founder and full member, and benefiting from it til the end of times...
Stones got a new drummer after 80 years, Journey get a new singer every other week. Foreigner tours without any original member.
Well Rick.. tell that to The Stones... 😏
What about Queen then?
U1.5
The real story apparently is that, they went looking for Larry at his new address, but the street had no name, so they had to hire some other dude.
Bram grooved incredible hard with respect for the original parts Larry played. Great, great job Bram, congrats!!
I can understand the point. But what about the Stones then? I guess they are going to go on - without Charlie Watts. I mean; Bill Wymann - gone, Charlie Watts - RIP. So? Or maybe I've got sth wrong, dunno.
@RickBeato it's a decision the original band made together, from everything I've read. If Larry can't play, and presumably was part of (or asked to be part of) the audition process, why should any of us get to have an opinion? It's their band, their music, their careers, their shows, and this is what they want to do. What's there to talk about?
I’m talking from October 23. The U2 sphere show is excellent.
6 months after...the world is glad U2 introduce the Sphere to the world and the internet is full of videos of that night - tickets start from 500$ and everybody wishes to get in.  As much as i love Larry It was a briliant idea to do this.
Sorry, Rick…I usually am on the same page as you,, generally speaking. But not in this case.
Hello from Ireland and, yes, I completely agree. I've been a U2 head for decades. I have every album, every DVD, the books and the memories. But this LV gig is about one thing and one thing only: Cash. Larry's absence should have been the signal to call it off, even if it was going to cost them. Without Larry U2 is three-quarters of an iconic band and three-quarters isn't good enough. No disrespect intended to the fine stand-in drummer. Instead of trying to cream more money, the band should have got themselves back to the studio to start work on a new album. Unless the well has run dry. Has it? Instead, they issued a double album of old songs with a new makeover. First U2 album I didn't bother buying. It feels like we're seeing the beginning of the end and it had to come some time. Nothing is permanent except death. Anyway, it was a great ride and their best albums are still the best albums rock has to offer. Pity they chose do their swan song in a place that embodies everything Bono professes to detest.
The ONLY thing stopping us from instantly grabbing a ticket and burning money on the ticket, hotel, week unpaid off work, etc...was the Larry Mullen factor. Having seen the show via Youtube (cause we're not gonna make it to vegas), Bram is awesome and Bono's acknowledgement of 'who the hell are you?' (in time slip Fly character) on opening night (YouTube gave me the ticket and we went...before the record company crushed it..LOL!)  was perfect. But it is noticeable it's not Larry playing the fills. I'm glad the show went on because what they (the whole U2 team) have created is an incredible show that zooms from intensity to intimacy seamlessly. Only U2 could pull this new media off These venues need to be (and are going to be) built everywhere.
After seeing footage from the shows it’s clear the production has been planned well before the building construction and from what I’ve seen the sound is something unique to the venue and needs to be experienced to truly appreciate.   What is interesting is Larry is with the band as they had been all together when shooting the video in downtown Las Vegas.  U2 has been a band I’ve always wanted to see in concert and had been worried I’d not get to see them as the original lineup however they sound incredible in the footage from the sphere.
I agree with your assessment Rick 100%. Yes as a drummer Larry Mullen Jr. Has been an inspiration,  besides that they are like Led Zeppelin,  you cannot play without the magic of the four individuals coming together. I felt the same way about ZZ Top touring without Dusty. You cannot go on without such a key member. There are amazing, fantastic, over the Top drummers that could play all the Rush songs with ease. (Portnoy) comes to mind.  But without Neil Peart on drums in Rush the fans would not accept it. I think Armageddon would occur if Rush did that. So I feel the fans would understand lf they had to wait a little while for Larry to come back.  Larry's grooves and feel make the music and feel in U2. I've seen The Smashing Pumpkins with and without Jimmy Chamberlain and honestly they were low grade without Jimmy..The band s strength and groove are centered around Jimmy's drumming.
This seems to be kind of an absurd argument. You also play loose with facts. U2 has performers without Mullin before. They have also performed without Clayton. There is, despite your argument, a LOT of money coming in for U2 even without these shows. Do your research! That said, this was a once in a life time offer that any band would kill for. Just like Zoo TV changed stadium shows permanently, this Sphere show will change the future of concerts. Mullin is in full support of it and he is even recording with them during the residency. It would have been great if Larry could perform, but he is taking care of Larry. It is an amazing show and I hope you get to see it. The band has made history, again.
I respect Rick's perspective, however those who've been to the Sphere shows seem to be thrilled U2 are doing this.
Correction Rick, The school where U2 started is called Mount Temple, I know because I live close by.
5:06 someone took a break on the guitar between takes 🙂
I think U2 wanted to be the first Rock act to appear in the Sphere and,unfortunately,Larry’s surgery made it impossible for him to participate.
Video didnt age well
Am I on crack or did Larry Mullen Jr just get injured? I mean it’s reported by multiple reputable sources and by Mullen himself. Dude isn’t going anywhere this was just bad timing
Hear me out, Larry Mullen Jr., hologram.
Am I wrong in my understanding that they made the deal pre-Larry injury/surgery and that they were contractually obligated to play the dates regardless?
Tuned in...Thought I was watching Adam Clayton.......
And then..there was the more than fantastic Bram van den Berg...what a great drummer..and in full respect to Larry.
It was actually a (potentially) brilliant move.  We were at the Sphere on the first night and the technology was the show.  Don't get me wrong, the music was amazing but the experience was like standing in a pair of virtual reality googles.  This sets up a second residency or tour billed as Larry's return.  Expect "Pop Mart - 2027" at a "Sphere" somewhere in Europe, on the 30th anniversary of that album.  We'll be there.
I don't think that U2 payed for that ad. I'm pretty sure that that Sphere thing did and they need the biggest stars.
Give it up, Rick. Larry needs back surgery. The Sphere gigs were booked a long time ago.
Larry could only go 30 minutes in rehearsal.  His body is 62 years old and it took a beating during their last 3 tours.  He didn't think he could endure an 11-day stint in Vegas so they got his protege' to stand in.  I think the Sphere paid for some if not all of the Super Bowl ad. Costing over $1 billion to create the Sphere, a Super Bowl ad is pennies. They'll make that back on concessions as it costs $50 for a beer and 2 water bottles.  They will make money on hotel rooms as well.  Also, Apple paid U2 over $100 million to put their album on all of their devices.
With or Without You...Without YOu it is
You wanna rethink this now?
As you U2 fan since 1983 I am 95% agree with you. I've seen all the Italian gigs since 1987 (unfortunatly I missed The Unforgettable Fire Tour in 1985), I was also very lucky to work for them in several gigs in Italy as well, I knew them personally, I had some quick chat with them too and in my opinion they have chosen to do the Las Vegas gig mainly for the opportunity to expolit the magnificient of the technologies embedded in the venue (particulary for Achtung Baby's music/visual concept) and the Opening it was too much yummy for them despite of the Mullen's injury. This is my 5% excuse but the 95% it's actually a money matter and it's very sad to me as a first time fan. After McGuinness' retirement (don't sure if it was so planned for him), but mostly after Live Nation's contract and during the actual Fogel's era, U2 became very "money oriented" either musically and live performing. Probably a little step back to the origin could be good think both for them and the audience but I think that it will be hard. Anyway I hope that Mullen will fully recover from the surgery and still attend to original U2 gigs.
I don't think his health has anything to do with Larry being mia. It's because Larry said U2 was becoming "more of a benevolent dictatorship"...
What kind of surgery takes half a year to recover from? Perhaps Larry is seriously ill, and it's in doubt he'll be back at all.
Let me tell you a little story about a little girl and a wolf.  And the little girl 's grandma...
my buddy Rich lol
Let's face it, Bram isn't the problem with U2 at the moment. He's a great drummer and a worthy temp replacement of Larry (just YT The Fly of both gigs, he sounds great). But as he said on night 1, there's only one Larry Mullen Jr. The biggest flaw with the recent Las Vegas gigs is that Bono vocals are lacking.
Bram isn;t there to write the album, he's there to do the live stuff. The album is already 30 years old. Any seasoned and skilled hired-gun drummer should have no problem to emulate Larry and do a good show.
It seems as if nobody here gets it. There is only one Grand Opening, only 1 first show in a venue like the sphere. Nobody has seen anything like it. It was an honor for them.
I'm sure Larry is fine with the payday and honor that they're all going to make for opening a technological breakthrough like the sphere venue.
Bram has done wonderful drumming in the first 2 sphere concert..... after these 25 shows, Larry will be back. Stop complaining and enjoy the music.
I didn’t see the ad but my opinion on the Larry Mullen issue is that it’s not so much about Larry or the fans even…It’s wanting to be the first band to open this venue of 360 degree immersive technology the likes of which appear nowhere else on earth. Imagine MSG merged with the Hayden Planetarium.  Being the first will be historic if you can appreciate the virgin technology being utilized in this venue. It would be like missing out on Woodstock or Live-Aid. It’s historic. I get it. I get their thought process. I’m sure it was met with some intense lash back by Larry and those in his camp and who knows maybe the band as a whole were disappointed and distressed over the fact that his health was going to keep him from performing at this venue that they have been working towards for years now. Couldn’t have been an easy decision. I’ve read an interview LMJ gave about his health issues post pandemic and from years of touring and the toll it’s taken on his joints and spine, etc. He stated that he felt now was the time to focus on his health. His decision. Bad timing? Necessary timing. Yeah I’m upset by it also that I passed on early purchase of tickets months and months ago when I was notified through the fan club about early access. I was busy and thought I’d get back to it. I fear it was a mistake I will regret deeply. These shows will be historic ones and that’s why the band as a whole made the difficult decision that the show must go on. Not unlike the Stones after Charlie Watts passing or Queen after Freddie died. Both bands still going. Thankfully Larry is alive and will recover and be back when he’s well enough to do so.
They  signed a contract and they cant get out of it ....its that simple +money money money and jobs .
Vegas is where artists go to die but U2 lost it decades ago. By doing these gigs U2 are essentially saying to their fans 'we're not travelling anymore and don't want to the cost of hauling around all the staging etc'. Fuck it, you lot can come to us'.  It's all about the money.
Hey Rick. Did you catch LMj on new release Atomic City? Love from Billionaire fan since 1999 U2 since 1989.
I think U2 should have had the spine to say: 'We want to do this gig, especially one about this excellent record, but only with Larry, when he's back on his feet.' Like Rick I am a big fan of U2, ever since I accidently got a copy of Achtung Baby. I was hooked. I mean I get that there's probably contractual agreements as well? I am pretty sure money plays a big role here, but as I said I think U2 should have had the spine to say 'No, not now.'
I’m a fan of your channel Rick, but I totally disagree with this one. Page and a plant played w/o Bonham or JpJ and I was so grateful to see them, Pimk Floyd played without Syd or Roger and again I was so grateful to see them. Larry is amazing and yes, it’s a bummer he’s not playing for sure, but if the other guys want to rock then they surely should.
Listened to the residency. Sounds bloody awful. Bono can’t remember his lyrics. His voice sounds terrible. And tbh they should have sacked it off like REM did decades ago - Tbf they haven’t done anything approaching a decent album since All That You Can’t Leave Behind!
So take out Larry, cancel the shows and ruin everyone who planned for it? No, the show must go on
Why don't you give the replacement drummer a chance?
I'm still waiting for the day Boner will be replaced.
They just wanted to open the sphere i guess and not miss out. Cant beat a Dutch drummer with clogs btw :)
The fact that they are able to sell tickets proves that most people don’t care who the drummer it and will pay to see what’s left of U2.
U2 may have committed to opening the sphere before the construction went at least a year beyond schedule.  They were probably contractually bound to opening the venue. Further, the development of the very technology being used may have been heavily dependent  on U2's residency and all the multimedia used, developed, and tested just to get it working.  Most importantly though, U2 is a four-piece equal partnership operation. It used to be 5-equal before manager Paul McGuinness retired.  Nothing gets done in this band without Larry's approval. They have at least 2 albums ready to come out.  Their future is a long-range campaign, probably planned years in advance and opening the most revolutionary high-tech concert space is a MUST-DO for them.  In my opinion, Larry likely had a huge part in this decision and very likely a very huge part in selecting Bram van den Berg as the drummer to stand in for him.  Larry's not just the band's drummer. He's the founder and 25% owner.  I'm sure Larry is 100% cool with this. And if you disagree, you should probably speak to Larry Mullen Jr. about it.    Love ya, Rick.
Larry’s decision
Larry hasnot been replaced. He's had neck surgrey and can't drum for a year. New album is due next year Larry will be back. Chirs Martin stood in for bono when he had his bike accident its sick leave I  a way. I do agree won't be same without Larry. But he will be back
There's only one opinion that matters here...and that is Larry's own opinion. And we don't know, do we? I can only hope his opinion was heard and the band is following this. In case it was...then just accept it...if not...by all means rant
So I read the other day that the guy who’s behind the sphere was dead set on u2 being the first band. He offered them 10M + 90% of door. I’m pretty sure that’s what I read.
I don't think is a as bad as you make it sound...  it's not like they are kicking Larry out of the band.
Can we be happy for the fill in drummer who will make more money in a few weeks than most of us will make in a lifetime?
Every breaking wave is their best song.
It’s showbizz. ‘Las Vegas’. Establishment (and the show must go on). Substitute drummer is from the Netherlands (as am I). Plays with a band called Krezip. Anagram (in Dutch) of the word ‘peach’. Perzik. Why this guy ended up playing with U2 still isn’t clear, is it? But anyway… can you imagine…. Vegas. Says it all, doesn’t it? Seems they’ve lost what they were looking for… Once upon a long ago.
Truth! The same is New Order without Peter Hook. If Larry can’t play or any other member, stop with dignity. Love you U2!
Rick, Larry had surgery and is recuperating !! That's why they have a stand in playing with them !! Don't worry he's not leaving the band just recuperating!!
I did not listen to your presentation but when I saw the name U2 I just want to comment that they are the most overrated band of all time!
Why hate? Good for U2
Bono joined the WEF...what more can you say....don't ever have heroes... they'll disappoint you every time. Bono is a WEF puppet.
As a lifelong fan since 1983, I am a little disheartened that Larry isn’t playing at these, the most important shows of their (the band’s) lives, and career. I can’t understand how the creators of the Sphere couldn’t have delayed the opening for a couple(few) more moths in order to have U2 - the worlds greatest band, open the greatest venue in the world - in their entirety.  The 👁️ of the world will be on this drummer (honestly - no pressure m8 🫣)!   The extremely brave man has an awful lot to live up to, and I wish him all the very best!!   Rather him than me!!!
U2 is Larry Mullen Jnr without him U2 wouldn’t be a band they would all be in a band but it would not U2. As a massive fan that’s seen them live many times, even if it was on my doorstep in the UK, I  wouldn’t be going.
I was a metal head when they came out. My sis friend told me I gotta hear this band. HOGWASH I said! Played me New Year's Day and I felt something that hooked me from then. Thank God I wised up!!! Soooooo many hours spent listening to them!!! Thank U U2!!!
What would happen if it was The Edge? Do they were looking for someone to fill his place?
Now, why did Led Zeppelin quit originally?
U2 need to retire. Go and release solo records or whatever and people will always love them but they can't deny the band itself is spent.
Wait for Larry to get well or tell the truth saying he’s done playing!
But what do you think about this venue?
People wanted to get rid of the album off their phones because people shuffle they’re music, and don’t want something they don’t like randomly coming on all the time
I'd like to see you revisit this now that six months have passed and we're closer to the event, or when their residency is complete with some hindsight.
"they don't want to let people down"? they've been doing nothing but, for the biggest part of their career, since the early 90s. "lucky" thing that doesn't mean too many albums.  i used to be a huge u2 fan, too. after all that you can't leave behind, i couldn't be bothered to download their songs for free - it was clear they weren't among those things. that, and how to dismantle... bla-bla, i still tried to listen to, at least, but it could take days or weeks since learning about them, to get to it - that's how excited i was - more out of hope that a miracle might have happened, although i wasn't counting on it - and it was an effort. now i don't even know when and if they release anything anymore, and if i accidentally hear they do, it's like listening to news about the weather.  since achtung baby, and their "friendship" with the "movers and the shakers" of this world, they've completely lost compass - moral, musical, and any other way you can think of.  it's probably one of the biggest and most disappointing 180 degree turnarounds in the history of music. listening to their interviews, as a young guy, i thought they were smart. now i think they have sterile wits, but the deep intelligence is not there. otherwise they wouldn't have chosen they path that they have. and in terms of their political involvement, i could even get some harsh words out, but i'm gonna refrain. i'd just say they wouldn't necessary leave out the word "murderous".
The goal is simple, get someone who can fill Larry’s shoes. If they can do it, the party will be amazing. I’d love to go and see it and particularly in this groundbreaking venue. Maybe they shouldn’t focus on Actung baby and just play the best of set list. Still, replacing Larry is doable. Replacing Bono or the edge, then you seriously have a no go. As far as the Superbowl advertisement, big deal. Most people probably didn’t even notice.
I think you're right Rick. They've been together from school until their 60's and why at the last hurdle of their careers so to speak would they do this and taint that incredible, unrivalled story of a bands longevity and dedication to each other. To be playing without Larry at this stage of the bands career is just bizarre. Somethings not right. If Larry just needs time to recover then why not all take the break with him.  Hopefully it's not because Larry is more ill than is being said. The other thing that comes to mind is that Larry particularly has had disagreements with Bono over his  involvement with Bush, Clinton and the likes and I think Bono and Edges underground Ukraine gig could have been the last straw, who knows but somethings not right.
Back problems. If you ever have back problems, you will understand it hurts
You wouldn't say that about The cure, would you?
I've been a U2 fan for exactly 39 years this summer, I became a fan at the perfect time to see them blast off into the stratosphere! I am a drummer, Stewart Copeland and Larry Mullen jr. were a big part of that. Larry is my favourite member of the band and I honestly can't imagine what it would be like to hear HIS songs live without him playing them.
That would be Mount temple not the other way round
My understanding of Larry’s injury’s is his wrists from bashing out those drums all these years. I pray this isn’t his demise permanently he’s an underrated drummer that’s for sure.  I could never stand that 80s beat monologue that Larry didn’t play. I think it’s ok to get a fill in while he recovers from surgery.  Bono’s voice I think is a little lower and raspy as well in my opinion but he still handles it ok, years of screaming I guess ! Really he’s a great singer still and at the 360 tour in Sydney they were perfect even better than last time.
As U2, I would not disband, but I surely wouldn´t make a concert w/o one band member.
I love how riled up you are here.
I don’t think they are replacing Larry from his band. Remember it is his band. I think is is just puffed out and physically can’t do it anymore. Not his fault or the band’s fault it’s just he can’t physically do it with being self taught. A bit must be said for structure good technique and discipline 🤷🏼‍♂️ when yer puffed oot yer puffed oot as we say in Scotland 😏
I will watch them, I do not care if Larry is not there, I know that they have a contract to open the Sphere, bad luck that Larry is not going to be there
I smell big cash grab by an untested manager. U2 have every right to perform without Larry, if he's ill, but announcing it via a Superbowl commercial? Tacky and waste of the band's money. I've been a fan since Boy, I'm disappointed.
I saw commercial this week for the Vargas gig and it was flashing words constantly to the point of severe annoyance.
The band is largely inconsequential here. The sphere isn’t a regular concert venue. It’s a strange 360 type experience.
I heard some years ago that U2 was considered an industry in Ireland, that being said, the train won't stop.
Late getting here for this one and almost certainly not the first to point out that you may have noticed how some of the bands activities etc have changed since their livenation deal that changed the entire management...  It sounded too good to be true at the time and funnily enough was. @RickBeato sadly many of your comments about seeing them live etc are entirely true, but they just don't have full control over their live performances etc anymore.  In many ways it's the complete opposite of Taylor Swifts situation.
There are some members of bands that can't be replaced .Larry is one of those guys
I just think U2 wanted to have the unique occasion to open the Sphere, but those at the Sphere couldn't wait until Larry Mullen Jr. has recoverd from surgery. Therefore a replacement drummer was needed...
The wheels are falling off. First Paul McGuinnes left as manager. Then  U2 became a legacy/tribute act, touring the Joshua Tree 30 years after its release Then there was an album of 're-imagined' old classics. Now they are doing a tour for rich Vegas high rollers without their drummer and founding member.
How very Vegas.
Got your point. I didn’t get it either why they can’t just simply wait for Larry to recuperate and join. So when are you going to have The Edge on your channel? Have you tried reaching out?
Yes, bands replace members all the time and go on.  Sometimes it works out.  But, U2 isn't U2 without Larry Mullen, Jr.
LP played after Chester died. So will Foo Fighters, a residency without Larry is not a big deal
Clearly short of a few quid. Seen the ticket prices!!!! Streuth!!!!
This is such a myopic viewpoint imo. Love your show, but here you are essentially saying a band should call it quits when they have been around for 40 years and an original member cannot play with them for whatever reason.    While I understand the viewpoint, this absolute purist mentality doesn't show any support to the band at all and what they want to do. It is only about what the fan wants them to do. Ugh.
The only time I've seen U2 was for their Lemon tour, I had been a fan until Unforgettable Fire mostly, then I was just listening to other stuff. The thing is the concert was amazing and what most caught my attention was Larry's drumming, I had thought they would be using more programming, so seeing him playing everything and sounding so great was awesome. So yeah, bad move.
I wonder what Glen Fricker thinks about all the Gibsons in the background.
Rick Beato looks a little like Adam Clayton!!!
Rick spitting facts
Why so much animosity from you?  This Vegas deal has been in the works for years.  They are getting older and medical stuff will happen more frequently.  They will probably not be the same group going forward.  It’s hard for a drummer to keep that stamina up for that many years.  Cut em some slack dude.
U2 make me wanna die I don’t get the catch
The best singer is Roy Orbison the second best is Elvis
100% AGREE WITH YOU.that would be like rolling stones replacing KEITH RICHARDS ..so underwhelming  to here this stuff goes on.
lm jr wanted to leave years ago...
Totally agree! To leave out Mullen Jr. is just straight wrong.
Yeah, I mean it's very strange. Why does U2 have, need or want to do this???? They have some of the biggest records of all time!!!! I love them. Been a fan since Unforgettable Fire and I've seen and followed them ever since. I just don't get why they're doing this.
I like U2 a lot but their Songs of Surrender just doesn’t cut it for me.  I love a good instrumental version of an original but these songs just feel flat.  It appears to me that with Surrender and the Sphere shows they are just rehashing old songs to make money.  New material with all the members PLEASE!
Queen replacing Mercury...?
Its all about the money.
It’s all very weird. But, you’re right. I’m much less inclined to go to Vegas without the whole band. Feels desperate, when they make the rules.
it’s the hardest thing, knowing when to quit and move on to other projects (they are still great musicians) and I agree, I think The Police (my favorite band) did it just right, I’m glad they came back for an impromptu tour…but there is no need to be redundant with albums that you know are not going to measure up to the standard you yourself created.  U2’s great last album was Achtung Baby IMHO, and although I feel some single gems came out between then and now, their sound and output became a bit redundant and less relevant (sort of like The Stones) and whether this is to please the fans, make more money, or some other narcissistic reason (maybe all of the above) all this is just it’s a waste of an amazing music legacy.
I agree with you Rick. But 95% of the people going to that show wouldn't know Larry Mullen Jr. if they tripped over him on the sidewalk. If the new drummer plays the parts and Edge and Bono front a good show it will be well received. It's musicians who will take offence to this. I think the truth of it is that being out of the public eye too long leads to people forgetting you and this is likely why they can't wait another year for Mullen's return from surgery and recuperation. Another aspect of this is just how hard it is for drummers to play over many decades as it is the most physical job in the band.
Agreed, also Larry misses out on playing the new Venue
Another reason why I respect Rush more than ever.
It's not about fans or a long hiatus. Bono's ego has run amok again. Edge ain't too far behind. The new manager is just stroking it. U2 is U-poo without Larry!
I think Bonos stuck in a moment
You should hear the band of Bono’s son, Inhaler, they’re great
Agreed that it's weird! But we support the guys and wish Larry the very best with recovery. Can't wait to see him back on the kit in the future!
Rick,,, Bono and the band want to go out and play,,,,it's gotta be A LITTLE BIT OF Money\Stardom thing. There's probably bored out of there minds. Musicians play that's what we do. BUT I get you 43 years with the same guys ,,,,MAYBE THERE IS A GET-ALONG PROBLEM WITH THE DRUMMER. WE DON'T LIVE WITH THESE GUYS ,SO THE REAL TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS LOST TO US. ALSO IF YOU NEVER SAW U2 THEN HERES YOUR CHANCE.   I THINK IT'S ALL THE MONEY THING.  ASK IF THEY WOULD DO THE RESIDENTIAL FOR FREE TO SUPPORT THE HOMRLESS OR POOR PEOPLE,,,THEN THEY PROBABLY WOULD NOT SHOW UP.
The fill in is actually a good drummer but it's a very strange move. Golden Earing stopped as aband because George Kooimans unfortunately has ALS. He can not be replaced.
I have been a U2 fan since 1983.  I watched them climb up from nothing.  I always had them figured as 4 individuals who were greater than the sum of their parts.  The only justification for a fill in or replacement member is if someone in the band dies.  Maybe not even then.  Led Zeppelin hung it up when John Bonham died.   Take away any member and it's just not U2 anymore.
u2 died at achtung baby
I suspect the word "Content" was being bandied around in a lot of the meetings that "New Manager Guy" has been arranging.  Wherever one notices a "soul vacuum" in an artist's trajectory (Vegas Residency also hits this same mark), there's usually some non-artist Agent/Manager type pedalling this same kind of mojo-killing, revenue based rhetoric.   Look, I'm not saying he actually "worships" satan...
I'm as massive fan. I think they should rap it up. They haven't made anything of substance in over a decade.
Usually love these videos but the thought that someone who became a fan fairly recently couldn’t have discovered Achtung Baby and loved it isn’t something that is that far fetched. Younger fans discover and love older music all the time. I am always surrounded by much younger people at shows for bands I have been a fan of for decades and they weren’t even born when the albums came out.
U2's last great album was "All That You Can't Leave Behind"  -  after that the band simply died  -  it's been 23 years since then, so unsurprisingly they again do mistakes like this one -  and yes, I'm still a U2 fan, from 2000s  and before, just not after
Larry Mullin Jr had shoulder, elbow and hand surgery. It takes a long time to recover. With that said I'll wait until he comes back. He's the foundation of this great band.
Rick Beato telling it like it is. Follow the money!
No Larry, no biggie. It’s only a few shows that a minimal amount of their total fan base are going to see. They’ll be back full strength when Larry heals.
It's so WEAK... Money Grab...  Bozo and the Edge, wow.
Did Lazzer fall out with the Ed?
Fan for decades here, I dont know what they are doing, they re selling tons of tickets,, but it feels wrong
..and: no regular guy can afford these tickets. What is the sick talking about "wanting to see our fans again"? What does Bono mean? His rich fans? He misses his rich fans, aha, understood...!
In my opinion, for every band or artist there comes a time when you are running out of ideas. Of course you always get songs together somehow but it's nothing special anymore or you repeat yourself. I think U2 have reached this point. The albums of the 80s and 90s were phenomenal. What should come after that? The bar is raised higher and higher and at some point it doesn't work anymore or you get tired of pushing it further and further. On the last U2 albums I couldn't hear that earlier spirit anymore. The songs became predictable and no more big surprises. When I heard "Pride" or "Bad" for the first time, I got goose bumps. But you can't expect such ideas from musicians all the time and I think they want to cash in again before they stop. If you're honest, most people would do that.
If I'm going to see U2 perform, it's because of the band members. I don't care if they roll on stage in wheel chairs, because I'm there to see them play their music, not some substitute. Besides, nobody can play Larry Mullen Jr's drum licks like he can. NOBODY!! Can you dig it?
Music is such an *intensely personal* aspect of an individual's identity that many people get upset/indignant/outraged when a band changes things around.  Remember when Michael McDonald joined the Doobie Brothers when Tom Johnston took a break?  It was like The Holocaust for some people.  Music is a business, and it goes way beyond four chaps in a garage pounding out some tunes until the neighbors call the cops.  We as fans don't own our favorite bands; we don't get to vote on how they run their business.  But we can vote with our money--we buy their stuff or we don't.
The 1st 3 albums are my favs. Especially October. More spacious Great bass!
U2 playing Vegas doesn’t sit with me. I guess they had a commitment to the shows and just had to get someone to fill in.
I too was at the Sept. 3rd show at Veterans Stadium.
Got my tickets for LV this week. Sad Larry won't be there, but hoping the Sphere will take the Achtung / Zoo TV video experience to another level.  Pray for Larry's full healing.
Honestly, I don’t even think they give a f***! They’ve already been to the moon 🌙 & back so many times with all thier fans anyways. If anything it’ll be quite invigorating for U2 just as was Adam Clayton’s recently born baby, both anomaly’s will prove to have been the driving force behind what will be U2s final chapter ❤
I Believe Larry Mullen Jr. is Recovering from Spinal Surgery ....
U2 is amazing!
with that Logic I guess the Who should have stopped recording and playing after Keith Moon died .. or John Entwistle
It's not clear to me what you're taking issue with here. They've been offered the opportunity to forever be the band that launched this groundbreaking music/experience venue. I'm sure they'd much rather do it with Larry, but he's not fit for it. Should they just say no and stay home? I'm sure Larry Mullen wouldn't want that
I like it when it sounds like you say YouTube every time you say U2. Not sure if that is on purpose or no, but it kept cracking me up.
Ok, I respect the hell out of Rick, but I totally disagree with him here. 1.  U2 have been contemplating an AB tour for a few years already.  2. Anyone who saw the original ZOO TV tour knows it was technologically driven. This is apparently the most technology infused stadium ever built. Like the commercial says “how could they say no?” 3.  Is there any better city for Bono’s alter ego “The Fly” to play in than Las Vegas?  It just makes sense.  4.  Surely it’s just bad timing for Larry. He’d be there if he wasn’t recovering. There really is no better band + album to have as the opening gig at this place.
Perhaps Larry has given his blessing - he may be very poorly ??
Think it's -150 that Bono put a chunk of money in FTX.
😮People never heard Bram (the Dutch drummer hired for the Tour) play with the band yet they all have their opinions ready. Sad !!
Could a contractual obligation have anything to do with this?
I think there is a 90% chance Larry feels much better in time for rehearsals
U2 suck... again. No U2 album is centred around Mullin jnr. Every album is about Hewson . Me me me look at me
Thus residency was set up a while ago as seen by a superbowl video. I'm guessing the band expected to do This as the original 4, but. I'm sure they are under contract for the opening of the MSG sphere, which was pushed. And whether Larry is available for rhe new dates or not as they sat inn showbiz..  the show must go on.
Let’s wait and hear what the temporary new guy does. The boys say that he’s doing great in rehearsals. Listen to the Krezip records on which he drummed.
Look at ZZTOP 😢 NEVER MISSED A BEAT 😢
Actung Baby was one of the first CDs we bought when we were transitioning from "Cassette Tape" to CDs in the early 90s. Love that album.
The problem was that everytime you apple I tunes would start playing, It would be that damn U2 album.  EVERY TIME
I'm only aware of one U2 concert where not all four band members played, and that was on the ZooTV Tour.  Playing without Larry seems weird, though if he's in desperate need of this surgery, and the band have already committed to playing the Vegas residency, I guess they don't have much choice.  It could well end up that Larry becomes only their studio player, if he's having that many problems performing these days.  That'll be a sad situation for the band, but that way he still contributes to their sound.
I saw the Achtung Baby tour in a hockey arena in Toronto…I would never pay to see U2 without their original drummer, same with Aerosmith.
There is a 0.1% chance Larry misses these shows. He was just feeling bad when they announced them. Trust me, in October Larry will be there
Having surgery is of course a good reason not to play.  However, more to your point, it is odd they will perform without Larry.      As for the iTunes thing, that was embarrassing for the band.  Other people, such as you Rick, take music to the heart.  Bono's got a big head, and he especially was put in his place by people who use iTunes.  For me, iTunes is yucky as the sound quality lacks.  Yet, I'm sure if I didn't like the band and I actually used iTunes, I would have applauded deletion of their forced gift.    I've been a U2 fan for quite some time.  Most are at least very good if not great songs.  Some, not so good but that's expected given their generous output.  I'm more curious about what you think of their odd decision to make a so-called album, SONGS OF SURRENDER. I feel it's a lazy excuse to remain relevant given there is nothing new on the... "album."  And now, seeing how they will continue to perform in Vegas without Larry, it seems coherent to make the decision to move forward without Larry as an effort to somewhat desperately return to the spotlight.
what
I understand what's being said, but I don't understand the depth of emotion any more than Rick seemed to understand the anger over Songs of Innocence. At this stage of their careers - like the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd, et als - they're a cabaret act. There's nothing wrong with that, but the reason I stopped going to see my heroes is because I saw one over-hyped cabaret act too many. The passion and danger of the original material was utterly lacking. The walls of production and the armies of backing players prevent any mishaps. "No rock' n' roll was harmed or produced in the making of this schmaltz..."
Rick,  lets not criticize the band and lets  face it  as professional musicians. You know, I know and everybody, who has or had a band, knows how complicated is to make the things go on between 4 or 5 people in a band. Sometimes people want to go further , and the others don't . Well, so why the other members can't go into other different directions ? A band isn't the group of 13 people in the last supper, they can be replaced, with different musicians  If its creatively better or not, that's a different story,  but as the Greatest Freddie Mercury said " the show must go on".
I won't see New Order without Peter Hook! They need to call it off.
I'm so sorry, as a huge fan, i think this is very wrong. Larry IS U2. He's the cement, without Larry there would be no Bono, no Edge or an Adam. And yes, after October, Boy, War and the Joshua Tree is Achtung Baby there most special and for me the best sounding album. U2 at his biggest moment with a f***ing great show. I miss U2 when they were U2. Is this the begin of the end ?
I agree with Rick
I heard that Bono told Larry "I'm doing these shows...with or without you!"..... Sigh,  sorry! 😒
This is a good reason not to have an ego,  it's too late for Bono and the Edge. Don't get sucked in to your own success.
Im a lifelong U2 fanatic but at this point Id rather just go see a really good U2 Tribute band. It saddens me to see U2 live now as its nowhere close to what it used to be. They always just seem to be going through the motions now. Rick, check out U2 Lemon, A U2 tribute band from Chile if you get a chance. They are amazing!
I've been a massive U2 fan my whole life and I couldn't agree with you more. This is beyond stupid. If ya really feel the need to get out there and play these shows then just wait until Larry is well enough to join you! It almost seems like being the 1st band to perform in this new venue is what's most important to them which is very disappointing.
There will be plenty of fans who think of Bono and The Edge being the core of U2 so they won't feel cheated. From my point of view Larry Mullen is essential and I wish him a speedy recovery.
They can’t go play without their Heartbeat. I agree with you Rick. Bad idea. In the name of Love what are they thinking
The Beatles replaced Ringo on a tour because of illness so nothing new
U2 should have retired after ZooTV, in their peak, Achtung Baby was the last time they were actually relevant, Pop was the last time they tried to be relevant. It's jus like what you said about The Police but ego and money are too strong.
They are not U2 without Larry Mullen they are just Larry Mullen's cover band.
🎶 It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success 🎶 💸
Being that they're going to have a new version of ZooTV, I bet Larry is going to be up at 6AM in Dublin and play from home. He might play with one arm, he might joke with the fans and roast Bono a bit, but I bet he'll be a part of the shows. They did it 30 years ago with "Garth" (Dana Carvey) so I think history will repeat itself.
Dear Rick, What Are You Thinking?   All our triggers are egoic reactions.  Your entertaining video had me laughing. It’s a funny rant.   Unneighbourly what’s really going on? Psychologically based on your trigger it appears that your not good enough for Larry to join this show, or that your not good enough for u2 to not put the show on without Larry.  So putting egos aside.  Facts:  - the dome is the first 3D Spatial Audio built facility -U2 has the opportunity to be the first opening act - Larry can’t make for reasons we believe (but may not be true as the truth may be intentionally withheld) - Larry not attending will make no difference to me buying tickets as there is no way I want to miss this show at this location. I’d go see the show even if U2 were holograms, so if I get to see Bono and the Edge again as I did at the MCG for Achtung Baby & Zooropa, Wembley for Pop, Hyde Park, and Sydney Olympic for … Atomic Bomb  I wonder how your video would come across if you made it with showing your trigger on Larry and just reporting it as news of the event itself?
I feel really bad for Larry, but I'm sure that they cleared it with him before they decided to play without him It makes me sad, but I just hope that Larry is okay and recovers completely so that he can play with them next time And I have no idea why ANYBODY would object to having U2's music put on their phones! What the heck? I sure wouldn't object!!!!!!
I think I heard Jon Bon Jovi say that his band is not like U2... evidently he was wrong.
Money, money, money...
Bravo Rick what you say is true..I think that U2 has become a machine for making money and when one point is reached, everything is neglected except that the show goes on, i.e. that the money flows.   U2 became something they ran away from and moved against and against such principles they fought. I've been a U2 fan since the beginning, this is something new.
Watch Simple Minds instead.
Think f.f are carrying on without Taylor....
I remember watching ‘That Thing You Do’, it’s a movie about a one hit wonder band called ’The Wonders’. When the band is breaking up, the drumer meets one of his favorite musicians and he tells him that bands will break up and musicians got to keep playing. I guess he was telling him that the show must go on. While I don’t think U2 is breaking up, they surely talked about it and all 4 decided to go for it. I don’t really remember what show they made a film on a 2 day gig, but the band was forced to film it in one take, because Adam Clayton was hungover and had to take a break for one show. It must’ve been disappointing for hard core fans to see U2 without Clayton for one show, but it has happened before. U2 is one of those huge acts that has remained the same 4 musicians, so this will be interesting to see them live.
Hey I'm 30 and Achtung Baby is my favorite U2 album and top 5 albums for me of all time. And I discovered the album in around 2016. For some reason I just bounced between Joshua tree and HTDAAB and never forayed deeper into u2. Then I heard Ultraviolet Ray on shuffle and was like wait who is this U2
Very odd, and sad.  I hope Larry will be ok.
Well said, the best thing about u2 is they wrote every song together and played all but 1 concert together, the magic happens because they were a great team. This move is greedy and ruins their legacy for ever. Shame on you Bono and Edge, all you have achieved is to embarrass yourselves in front of your lifelong fans….. pathetic
Honestly, that project has been in the works for a long ass time.  The stage they’ve created is revolutionary. And for sure, they wouldn’t have done it without Larry‘s blessing.   U2 is a club, there are a lot of members in this club, the real fans know what I’m talking about.     Larry may not be there in the flesh but he will be there in spirit and guaranteed they’re gonna put on a great show regardless.     I’m sure he really wanted to be there, but the train was already rolling and you can’t fight nature.  A lot of people who have something to say have never really been injured as a performer or had other people rely on them to that level. I speak as a professional dancer of 25 years.   Sometimes my crew has to perform or compete without me.  Even though I’m the founder of the group, nothing is going to stop the spirit and those who are involved from doing what they gotta do for those who support them.  It’s time for people to mature a little bit and their perspective
You asked who wants to see Achtung Baby after 30 years. Well did you see the news? Ticket requests have reached 1 Million.
Rick. I first saw u2 in 1984 at Birmingham NEC England. Fan since seeing under a blood...in 83 on the tube. True original fan. Like you it's not perfect. But what a catalogue. I'm 53 now. Hope to see them in the English Midlands again. Love your stuff.
This is bizarre they are doing the Mecca of cabaret shows, maybe they just need the money, in fact next Dubai weddings, maybe a few spin off bands yeah 4 bands with one of each in the offshoot bands and bingo $$$$$
I think there are bigger issues behind...probably contractual? The Sphere is basically opening with U2 in mind. LMjr just unluckily got injured with a year long recovery. Probably it's financially better this way for the whole band?
Bono is an amazing songwriter and singer; Edge is an amazing guitarist; Adam is groovy and cool. But let's face it--U2 have made some godawful decisions since 2009 or so, and a lot of that has to do with Bono not being able to handle being the rich powerful person he is. He still pretends he's humble and is an ordinary guy, but he's really let the money get to him, even when he's doing supposedly good things like charitable "giving"--I mean moneymaking. Larry is the only one who I would trust with my money, and the fact that they're doing this without him really angers me.
I don't know what Rick's talking about, since U2 quit after "All That You Can't Leave behind" and NEVER RELEASED ANOTHER ALBUM AGAIN.
Completely disagree and my tickets are already booked ...bring it on
They certainly are allowed to take a stage and be entertainers, but it isn't "U2" without Larry. Larry and Adam did a thing together with Mission Impossible, and Bono/Edge have done the same. But it is not a U2 concert without all four of them. It is exactly their chemistry that makes them great.
Rick complains that most people are missing his point but he's the one that hides that point with digressions, repartitions and ramblings that bring up multiple "points".
I agree. One of those bands that ain't the same without the drummer
Calm down. Larry has a son who plays drums passing the torch to  his trusted air to hopefully extend "his band" and self made family business, to new generations  Their a very private family so you never herd of him 🤫🥁 Maybe Elija will come aboard???
I will not be going to see them at the Sphere because of this. Part of U2's legacy is the four OG members making legendary music together. It'll be hard to stomach watching them play again with some guy named Brad (from Guitar Center) filling in. Sure Brad will be technically good and hit every note perfectly but the songs just won't sound the same without Larry's personality, flair, and panache. At this point, they'd be better served to do what ABBA did with the holograms. Well, maybe not.
on zootv / zooropa Adam was few times too wasted to play so they did the gig without him, his tech played the bass
you are wrong on many levels in this video
this is no blunder
I generally like RB's interviews but this is a bit of a rant looking in from the outside. There are some excellent comments here which  mention commitments, rehabilitation etc. It is just 5 shows, it should be an incredible experience and as someone says here, lots of people will go buy the album with LM on it. Bands need to keep moving, playing. LM will be fit to come back in 2024. Hopefully! I think RB should take down this video. It's not helping and does not reflect well on him.
Mullen Jr and the Band aren't playing until late September. This is very intentional. Whatever surgery he has to recuperate from, he could recuperate from. Are the other three so desperate to play that they can't wait for him to heal? It is weird. On the other hand, a band with as much success as U2 is a business and there is clearly their own individual financial interests at play. Maybe he's not into it and the business end disagrees with him. To some degree they all probably have individual managers and handlers and who really knows what's going on? After 40+ years as a band, he is allowed to sit some shows out. No harm there. It shouldn't be such a big deal, but it seems quite deliberate. Whatever...
I got some U2 albums all on CD Compilations: 1. The best of 1980-1990 (1998 standard edition with B Side disc) and 1990-2000 (2002 standard edition without B-Side and remix disc and Japanese edition with B-Side and remix disc) I combined these two albums because both compilations I have by U2 starts with The Best Of Studio album: 2.  Boy (1980 the 12 track version) 3.  All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000, 20 years after the release of Boy)
Has anyone seen the information about Larry not touring with the band in the future? I thought I read that somewhere and not that he wasn’t just doing the Vegas stuff.
There could be lots of reasons this is happening.  1. They signed the residency contract pre Larry’s surgery requirement.   2. Larry may just have had enough for now and needs a time out.   3. Larry has a more serious issue which requires attention, but fully intends to come back.  4. In order for Larry to tour the two new albums they’re working on, he needs the time away now to ensure he can.   It pains me to say it, particularly having been a fan since the mid-80’s, but their time passed when NLOTH dropped.   Some material remains good, but there was a time when some wouldn’t have been good enough for U2.   All good things must come to an end.
Yep agreed Rick. U2 was my first "favorite band". They're rich enough...they don't need the money. Just wait till Larry's better.
Larry's replaced by the drummer from the Dutch band Krezip. It's our revenge for the time when The Beatles did their (only!) show in The Netherlands but had a replacement drummer, because Ringo was in the hospital. It's musical karma.
They did recently what IMHO is another 'blunder like that:  Bono Vox and The Edge went to NPR's Tiny Desk as a duo, simultaneously cashing on   U2's ultra mega superstar status and fame  while also trying to crash into and appeal  the TD's internet 'hipness' and its Gen XYZ appeal, in a sort of faux 'minimalist' format.   They did it by ditching Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr. Maybe they fell like they 'own' the band.
They have been a shell of themselves  for almost 20 years now.
Maybe they should give fans a 25% discount (or 50% or 75%)
Old Man Yelling at Clouds .......I love u2 and supporth their decisin to have a residency without Larry Mullins.  Now, is he essential to the bands sound,  HELL YES,  but I am all for another , yet temporary version of the band without Larry.  It wont be the SAME U2,  but it will probably still be bonecrusinly great.  Lilfe is not perfect
What do you think about this Motley Crue thing with Mick Mars and John 5
But I still love you too. Even though you got stuck in a moment🥳😊👍Rick. I forgive you.💝
Get over it  Love never fails. Larry has given his blessing so whats the prob. Plenty of drummers play these tunes for the love. Im going.  To support those I love. I think u r whining. Have some cheese. Goeswell with your whine.
I read the story about Larry Mullin needing surgery for tendinitis or something from drumming but I had no idea it was because of this. 😳I wouldn't want to see U2 without all members present since they are all still alive. Why not wait until Larry's recovered? Don't they already have enough money? I can't imagine being that bored or addicted to being on stage that I'd want to mess it up without having my band mates with me. It's why Led Zeppelin called it quits, it's just not the same.
They're surely not short of a quid? Plus Songs of Surrender in all the colours of the rainbow, the book tour, now residency. gees cmon!! enough!! I think its pretty poor form to carry on without a  member of the band that's injured. Make a proper album.
I think Larry is recovering from surgery
No one wears jean shirts as wear them. Such a cool guy you are.
You are so right, Rick.
i dunno... people still go to see the stones. if they wanna play till they die on stage, why not i guess
Rumor has it, he’s actually fed up with the direction the bands has been taken the last 20 years or so. The surgery is just an excuse. Since Achtung Baby they have not been the same at all. No real hit record or memorable, but the touring has been their Trademark.  They toured the Joshua Tree and now Achtung Baby?.... Sounds to many they have run out if any fresh ideas or memorable music or tunes.And this last “re-imagined”  of their hits album is just to light up these rumors even more. Nobody needs this new versions.
First all, I'm a huge u2 fan. Growing up with their music before the auctung 1990 CD. My first exposure was buying war CD in a pawn shop before that. I did manage to see them live finally for 2001 elevation tour. Almost for zooropa tour before. The drummer in any group seems to be the one replaceable in many groups and it's a travesty!  Especially a founding member! All about $$$. I still can't get that danm iTunes u2 album off my iPhone!
What's the old saying, the show must go on. Has anyone asked if Larry was the one to suggest the band proceed with the venue.
truthfully, I'm  going to Vegas see a performance in the Sphere mainly because it's a technical marvel.  U2 is just the side show at this point. Pretty good fit for it, they've written alot of good songs. But the Sphere hosting 3 top edm artists would probably be better show!
C'mon this happens all the time, a decent drummer can play these beats as well. Coming up them is hard of course, but that was already done.
Totally agree .. don’t do it
Celine, Brittany, Keith Urban, Garth... and U2?  Just seems like a sad way for them to go out.  I think he didn't want to be around for it and I don't blame him.
Unrelated but did you see professor fig in Hogwarts Legacy? I swear he’s modeled after you
U2 probably didn't think that anybody would complain that they advertised a residency during the Superbowl so that newer fans could see Achtung Baby played live, without the original drummer. It is a very specific, and odd, complaint.
Bono and Larry have had serious health problems for years. Both of them were heavy cigarette smokers until fairly recently. They’re not young men anymore, and things like this are to be expected.
Hewson's clearly not going to go quietly into that night.
Seeing them live during the Joshua Tree tour in 87 at 17 is one of those timeless memories. They were fantastic live back then. I can understand them missing the connection with the crowd from the stage, and Im guessing Larry gives his blessing… if he didnt want them to go without him I dont think they would.
Oi Mate, What Day are they Playing? Sunday. Bloody Sunday !
Not that they are on the same level, but Korn have played shows/tours with every member missing except Jon Davis. People still buy tickets.
I think the real question is how Bono continues not to pay taxes.
Have been a U2 fan for quite a while and the last album that gave me something was Pop, it's been pretty bland after that. And as someone said in another comment, Bono's voice isn't what it used to be. All things considered I think they should've quit on top of their game some 2 decades ago, leaving a treasure trove of music behind to be enjoyed for generations. But I get that it might be difficult for artists to just quit.
Terrible.
You are right and you are wrong. U2 without Larry is not U2 but if they want to play why shouldn't they? It is their job. I gig 9 gigs a week for the last 10 years and I should stop but I would hate not playing. In this day and age there's nothing wrong with getting a replacement for any length of time. Ask Pink Floyd with three lead singers. I hope Larry gets better enough to come back but the rest of the lads should continue without him if they want to.
U2 is a terrible band with ugly music. Will never get it why they got so big.
bono is a musician. the money means nothing. He lives to perform.
I gave up on U2 over ten years ago... at one point they were second only to The Beatles for me for many years.
Let’s all give Larry a break
It's disappointing to see U2 do this.  Would they continue if The Edge or Bono wasn't able to play?  Definitely not!  It sends the message that Larry (and let's face it, Adam too) are seen as replaceable.
I’ve been a U2 fan since I was a child (October album). I completely agree with you. It is hard to believe that a band a great as U2 is completely tone deaf with some of their decisions.
couldn't agree more. they have lost all dignity. they ARE LIKE BON JOVI.
Must be running out of money
What Bono Ono and his supporting band does since POP ( that's 1997!) is the biggest disgrace in popular music ever. And you ask yourself why Larry isn't here ? He's not an moron.
Larry's drumming is the foundation of the U2 signature sound and the rest of the band would be the first to say that. So for him to step down like that there must be a very very serious reason. Drumming is physically demanding and who knows, if Taylor Hawkins had done the same maybe he would still be alive, without being able to tour anymore.. Many pro athletes in their 30s or even younger had to stop their career suddenly and unexpectedly in the 2-3 recent years.. I think that was a safe and effective move from their part.
U2 has always moved in mysterious ways.
What a huge cynic. Many people miss playing live esp after the pandemic. I have seen U2 live many times and that's where they live, not in the studio. I'm 77 now and would love to see them live again. Even after surgery Larry may not be right again. I don’t blame them for trying out a new drummer just in case. u2 are the only band I know that have not had any line up changes since school.
a lot of people would still want to see U2 without Larry. i would. im more of a bono and the edge fan. plus its not the member.its their songs
I put U2 on the bench with the Popmart tour and they haven't earned their way off of it yet.
common....
😂😂😂 U2? Nooo it's Mr Ego Bono. Noooo way.  Yeah Rick enough is enough
It's a shame the drummer has got medical issues but if the rest of the band f if I can still perform I don't see the problem and they're happy to do steel come from playing with another drummer for the moment I don't see the problem Larry will be back playing with the U2 when he is better the Rolling Stones are doing it so why not you two ok I know the drummer passed away  if I can still perform I don't see the problem and they're happy to do it
…Rolling Stones 6:20 - with you on Rattle & Hum 4:53 superb album
I think this is all about economics-- U2 isn't the only band rushing to get dates lined up this year to cash in on the fact that people still have a 3+ year pent up demand for live events. God bless Larry for not rescheduling his surgery.
How's the drummer? The drummer is not fine.
I think October was easily their best album followed by boy. It seems that controversial lyrics determine a "great" record over the music itself, but while War and Fire were UNDOUBTABLY great U2 records, October was just so much more ear pleasing, interesting and raw from the heart as was Boy. I'm glad I don't listen to music like most people.
LM Jr is a criminally underrated drummer.
From what I've read, the band committed to this residency pre-COVID; COVID pushed the opening of this new venue back by several years. Whether for health and/or other reasons (read an October or November 2022 Washington Post interview where Larry almost suggests he's considering leaving the band because it's no longer enjoyable for him), Larry has said no touring in 2023. Other band members have said Larry will talk more when/if he's ready to do so. So Larry might be (for reasons apart from this Las Vegas residency)  considering leaving the band, but the rest of the band is not ready to retire. I hope I'm wrong on this. But lend no credence to the idea that the band *must* get back on the road; that's just standard Bono spin.  And is this a fumble? Yes, but the more appropriate comparison is to doing the Kmart promo for POP and opening the POPmart tour in Las Vegas.
Correct. Why do it if Larry’s not there? It’s his beats that drive the work. Why make the trip? Man, that money must be serious!
Wholeheartedly agree with Rick
My money would be that they had a contractual agreement to be the first band to perform in The Sphere set years ago, likely before the ground was even broken to build the thing. Given this arena was built specifically for visuals and sound and some supposedly awesome live experience, U2 would be the perfect band to open the place, probably with some special effects and visuals that have been in development for a long time just for this show.  I would imagine it would be far too expensive for them to back out at this stage.  Larry isn't out of the band, and no doubt he's still going to get a quarter share of those shows.  I would imagine he was likely pushing them to move forward so he could get that check (or at least didn't have to pay back what they likely were already paid)
So, it's U 1 1/4 ?
Perhaps Larry has cancer or something worse And the band just wants to play
They can do whatever the fuck they want , but they still suck , last good album was pop album
Didn’t Larry Mullen, Jr. form the band?   No Larry, no U2.
Not everyone has the grace to leave the stage on top like REM did.
I suspect Bono is behind this.. notice how Larry and Adam have always distanced themselves from Bono's galavanting and rubbing shoulders with politicians.. only Edge seems to follow Bono on his tirades..   As much as I can respect Bono for his undeniable musical/vocal contribution to the band, that much I sometimes cringe at some of his more questionable decisions..   You are right Rick.. what sort of friends are they to Larry if they can't wait for him to get better.. they don't need the money really and I don't buy this whole "we need to see our fans" thing..
I agree 100% Rick, I never thought U2 would become the band that did this, I thought if one member couldn't play that would be it, no gigs. I'd rather them quit than carry on with another drummer as Larry is essential to U2. I'm a fan since 1983 and I'm gutted they are doing this. U2 is Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton, Larry Mullen Jnr! One very disappointed fan!!
What about The Rolling Stones? They have had a lot of members and keep going.
I still remember buying tickets to hear Focus at my University Student Union in Glasgow in 1976. They were at the peak of their fame so I was looking forward to it. As soon as they came on stage we knew something was wrong. In place of legendary lead guitarist Jan Ackerman there was this young guy stooped over sheets of paper on the floor. Years later I read what had happened:  ‘In February 1976, two and a half days before the group's arrival to the UK for a tour, van Leer asked Akkerman to leave Focus over his disagreements with the music … [Belgian guitarist Philip Catherine was asked to step in]… After Catherine agreed to step in, the group rehearsed for fifty hours without sleep;[58] van Leer spent the evening prior the first gig mapping out the guitar parts on paper which Catherine followed on stage.[4]’ Wikipedia. Philip did his best and van Leer tried really hard to hold it together but it just didn’t work 😢
Who cares? U-2 are WEF creeps and most of their music is crap.
Not quite the same caliber as the iTunes fiasco, and I understand the significance of Larry Mullen Jr. not being there, but they haven't played live for over 3 years with a HUGE Vegas residency hanging in the balance! I think you play on. (And, how does Larry Mullen Jr. feel about it?) This could NOT have been an easy decision for the band to make.
Well if you want to show off your detachment from the average fan, and your general state of corruption, Las Vegas is a decent place to do it. I hope it will at least be entertainingly terrible, like Elvis' Vegas period.
I’m a long term fan, since Under a Blood Red Sky… the Sunday Bloody Sunday drum intro draws you into the maelstrom that follows… I’d be devastated if Larry left the band, but it’s not about me, or you… it’s about Larry and his band mates… if Larry’s back is as painful as I understand it is, he has my blessings to do whatever he needs to get right (not that he needs them!)  I’m his age and I know how it feels to look forward to perhaps the last 20 years of your life and want to be in reasonable condition … I wish Larry all the very best… as for the Vegas gigs… it’s the most tech advanced venue around, and I couldn’t think of anyone but U2 opening the venue… and Achtung Baby is the perfect vehicle to make a massive splash… so I wish them well too… it’ll be monumental… take care folks 😊
Larry is injured. It’s not rocket science. It’s about the location. The Sphere is going to be incredible. Look up the Sphere.
Larry Mullen Jr is all that you can't leave behind.
Agree 100%.  As a lifelong U2 fan, this sits poorly with me.
As a lifelong fan this feels like Larry has left the band, but it has not been publicly disclosed yet.
They could have asked buddy Klaus Schwab to fill in the drums 🤷
Come on U2.
Rolling Stone magazine said Larry Mullen Jr. To miss 2023 tour dates because of upcoming surgery.
I agree unless Larry is very sick but that brings up a whole other level.
YOU ARE TOTALLY CORRECT RICK!! Larry Mullen Jr. is absolutely essential to the concept of U2. It's not U2 without him. U2...LISTEN UP!!!
GENESIS   DONE!!!...did it the right way!!
PAUL McGUINNESS was the 5th member!!!!! ..then Terry Lawless in the underground!!!!
THANK GOD RICK HAD THE BALLS TO POST THIS!!!  THERE IS NO U2 WITHOUT LARRY!!! ITS HIS FUCKING BAND!!!
You nailed it. U2 without Larry Mullen, Jr. is not U2. It seems that contractual obligations have triumphed??
The guys are getting on. Bono's memoir Surrender, the bands new album Songs of Surrender and the upcoming Las Vegas residency all point to the same thing: nostalgia, looking back, rehashing, rinsing, repeating and re-evaluating. In short, with age comes evolutionary retardation and the potential danger of hitting of a creative brick wall.....oh, and these boys never said no to a few extra $$$$$$$'s in the back pocket.
He really is the genuine pulse of the band. No thanx, punk. Yes heard them in 92 at Dodger LA. Sure they were far away, but still a good spirited show all around. Vega$ I don't get. Esp with them. Elvis, they are not. poor U2. Change their name to Uzi cuz they so rad now.
Why does Led Zeppelin no longer exist?
I think Bono is all over this decision. it closely matches his solo gig for his book and given that Covid kept them off the road, he's eager to do something. Call it late life crisis or whatever but to push ahead while their drummer and friend is getting treatment surgery is just gross. They could wait but they won't...
😢 totally agree - btw - you said “33 years old kid “  😂😂
The reality is that people still want to hear the music. Yes its a pity the Larrys health has got in the way of him playing but he has given them the okay and you can guarantee U2 would not be pushed about to do something that they would be against. Musicians should not stop playing because of some peoples opinions on something that does not effect them. Good luck Larry in your recovery.
I'm still mad that they're supposed new album is just rehashed songs and they all sound awful.  Sadly Bono has no voice anymore and I think they should call it quits but yeah I don't think the residency is a good idea without Larry.  Plus of Bono can't sing how are they going to do a live show? I seriously doubt they're going to do auchtung baby acoustic
that's all they care about is the$$$$$$and they will get it!!!!! because people are stupid enough to pay for the fucking ridiculous prices that  others charge ❗❗❗❗❗ from the blacks to the whitess to the Asians and all of them.. females and males alike ❗❗❗❗ ITS A FUKIN CRIME ❗❗❗❗ DO YOU ALL KNOW HOW RICH THESE BANDS ARE BECAUSE OF YOU ❗❗❗❗❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓😡😠
I'm sure it's Bonos idea.. and I'm sure the other two band members sucked up to whatever Bono says... except for Larry 😡
If you injure yourself in football the team plays on and you return when recovered..I don’t understand even having the conversation
Total fail. Like the Clash without Topper. Speaking of the Clash, as Strummer said “theres a rule of rock & roll, you’re only as good as your drummer” U2 works because (like all great bands) the sum of the whole is greater than the individual parts, remove the drummer, the chemistry collapses, I’m sure the sit in guy is solid, the gig will be competent, but this is blunder-ville.
Most likely, the residency deal was done months before they realized Mullen couldn't play.  They were contractually locked in and didn't have a choice.  Regarding the commercial, the band had nothing to do with that.  The ad was arranged and paid for by the Vegas venue.
How 'bout they recruit Lanois, & Eno, to fill in for Larry!?
Rick….you nailed it
The last of the rockstars When hip-hop drove the big cars In the time when new media Was the big idea That was the big idea.
Seems like U2 is Stuck in a moment they can’t get out of
Larry needs back surgery before he can play again.
one of my favorite bands, but yes, Larry Mullen Jr. have we must
Isn't Larry Mullen missing the Vegas shows due to some medical issue? Besides..contract is contract these days...bookers just want them to play...it's all about the money. Instead of throwing themselves under the bus they found themselves a very capable replacement drummer. Simple as that. And besides...stuff like that happens all the time and for lot less solid reasons! 🤷‍♂
You even took the time to look up the name of 'some fill in guy'. Oh wait...I see people appreciating Rick for mentioning the importance of the drummer. No, he is being very respectful of one drummer and very disrespectful of another. In my opinion, of course.
Apart from the obvious, I knew Larry Mullen Jnr was sick of touring and felt as anyone doing repetitive "motions" over a long period and age was in pain and not enjoying it.  We get COVID, the vaccines and the virus. I know that after my first shot I was ill for 2 days, particularly in my wrists and  ankles felt pain they never had before. I see why Larry would not want to play, fair enough. But to just drop him like a drum machine and get some guy in I feel is bad craic. You are supposed to be a band, unless some of them have "money problems" I find it as a U2 fan from the early 80's to stink. I expected better, obviously stronger  personalities are desperate for U2 to perform. Probably Bono's family, they are sick of him mooching about the house LOL.
I was a massive U2 fan from 87, until around 2001. From that point, in my opinion, they became mediocre. Fast forward to now and these gigs with Larry, I mean, wtf? They could've waited for him to recover, but no. Imagine that happening when Bono was recovering from his bike accident when they postponed Glastonbury, "Ummm Bono, we really wannabe do this gig so we got (enter singer here) to do it, we can't wait for you to recover, sorry!". Well they did wait because it's not U2 without Bono or any other of the 4, so why not wait for Larry? Selfish imo. However, I bet there's a lot more to it than this, I reckon Larry didn't want to do it, they're supposed to be a forward looking band and for the past 6 years they've been looking back. Time to call it a day boys.
management rarely have the fans or the bands ethos forefront in their minds.
I think this is a band split, done in a very corporate way i.e. break the news gently and blur the lines.  Larry is on film stating he would never do a Vegas residency. He was not involved in Songs of Surrender (old recordings if he is on a track). Songs of Ascent (final breakup album) already in the can....I'm a massive fan, all periods, stuff on SOI/SOE is some of the best I think. Every album is a fav at release time and I go back to them all. But Larry's not messing about, he knows his own mind. Perhaps they're meeting contractual release numbers (suspiciously SOS is a "re-imagining", another play on words to make it count as a new album release rather than a "best of" or "unplugged" Granted he has back issues but doesn't stop you participating in promos etc...
I’ll just leave this here…U2 without Larry Mullen Jr. is like YES without Chris Squire or Jon Anderson…
Haven't been a good band for years..Bono has lost his way and dragged a good band down with him...sad.
I heard Larry has back issues.  Could it be that bad that he can't play?
To quote Neal Schon; “I just want my band back.” They want to rock, let ‘em rock. The drummer can’t or doesn’t want to be there.
You have to consider the studio time, as well as the touring schedule. Think of working out for 40 years straight. Take time to take care Larry.
Wait! You were at the U2/PJ show in Hawaii on your honeymoon?! I got married there the day before and went to that same show!
Rick, you´re right. And that re-imagined songs album? One of the most horrendous things I've heard in years - four disc album, 40 songs, bono with no force in his voice, no drums, no punch in any track. U2 rest in pieces:(
I completely agree with you!!!!!!
They had the Sphere already booked they cant help LMJ had a medical issue since.
U2 stopped being interesting as soon as Achtung Baby came out. It had great songs but the focus changed. The main collapse in the band is Bono. His writing became weak, his lyrics were just imitations of a younger man.
I agree. My favorite band. My MS days saw Boy, October, HS was War, Unforgettable Fire....then Joshua Tree my Freshman year of college and they have been cemented as the sound track of my life. Bad decision performing without Larry. Popmart wasn't a great decision. I am sure I will forgive them. Still hope Bad gets played at my funeral!!!lol
Look at the venue! u2 has always pushed the boundaries of experiential concerts they couldn’t pass on this opportunity to be the first ones to perform there
I didn't think that but I agree.
100% in agreement with you, Rick.
I hear Jimmie Nichol is still available to drum.
Finally, U2 have become a tribute band.   U2 were playing Glasgow and Bono did one of his political speeches. He started clapping slowly and announced "every time I clap my hands, a child in Africa dies"  A voice from the audience shouted "well stop f*cking clapping".
Two aspects. 1. Doing a LV residency is just corny as hell. 2. Without LMJ it’s not U2.
Once their new album comes out they’ll do a normal tour with the og 4
Bono want the bitty
Totally and wholeheartedly agree. I love U2. But what's the point without Mullen. They can't wait 6 months or a year? It just makes no sense to me unless there is just more to the story than we know. But even then, why?
Agree 100%. Been seeing them play live since 1981.  This is a big mistake  In fact they truly should retire.
This sounds like a rant😆
Absolutamente de acuerdo con todo lo que dices. Especialmente con lo de los fans en el video promocional. Hace años que pienso que U2 se esfuerza demasiado por seguir siendo relevante cuando la verdad es que ya no lo son, al menos no musicalmente. Siguen siendo para mi una de las mejores bandas, siguen sacando alguna que otra joya, pero ya no son relevantes. Parece que el mayor esfuerzo lo dirigen en cómo llegar a nuevo publico, en vez de hacerlo en lo musical. Y con eso quiero decir que BONO es el que lo hace.
Rick, you are so right I follow them since 1987 Sing this with me, this is 40 40 days in the desert and HE resisted
Glad i saw them on December 2019.
You knew music was in trouble when people didn't want a new U2 album. Idiotic. It's a great album, even better live.  And btw, people don't "own" iTunes. So Apple could do whatever they want.
Word by word, i agree on what you're saying there. U2-fan since 1980 (I was 9 years old, heard 'I will follow' on the radio and didn't know what hit me. Achtung Baby is, to this day, my favorite album of all time. But seeing them without Larry... the short answer is no.
Pretty much lost all interest in that slick, pretentious dinosaur band when they released Rattle and Hum as well as that video-clip where they're playing on the roof in downtown L.A. pretending to be the Beatles. Zzzz...
I'm a huge U2 fan since I was in my single digits. My favorite band, hands down. But yes, not playing with Larry is deeply upsetting. Can't they wait for him to have surgery and recover? I'd be much happier with that.  Maybe the COVID lockdowns in Ireland put ants in some of their pants. I'll still follow what I can of it, but not so excited to hear them without Larry.  And yes, a Super Bowl Ad was an odd choice. It's not as if they don't have the name recognition to fill all the seats.
Boohoo
As a 29 year old fan I have to say Achtung Baby is in fact my favorite album of all time- but I realize this isn't an opinion I've ever heard someone my age express 🤣  I share your feelings about this residency, but also have other concerns. Larry Mullen not playing is really unfortunate, and as much as they say it's just because he has to have back surgery- I can't help but wonder if that is cover for the fact that he might be burned on out on playing with U2. Sad as it is no band lasts forever, and he has made comments recently (and in the past) that suggest he might be ready to move on, apart from whatever health issues he is facing. I think in 2010 he said "I don't see myself at 65 playing in Vegas"....   Aside from Larry I have real concerns about whether Bono is up to the task of singing these songs again. If you've seen any of their limited live material of the last 3-4 years, it is clear his voice is not what it used to be at all- he can't hit any of the high notes he used to. After he completely lost his voice at a show on the last tour, and hearing how limited his range is in recent performances, I just don't know how he can pull off the big stadium belting rock voice that is required for this material. The Songs of Surrender release shows that even in a controlled, studio environment, he isn't able to sing the songs like he used to. Pretty much all of the songs are either lowered by many keys, or he just doesn't go for the high notes at all. U2 is a stadium band, and if Bono doesn't have the voice to fill these stadiums, I don't think there will be much steam left in U2's live shows. Breaks my heart to say it, I've been obsessed with this band for 15 years now, can sing & play most of their biggest songs on every instrument. U2 is a big part of the reason I love music so much today, but it might be time for them to move on 😢
This might be the only time I've disagreed with Rick. He seems to not even be considering the possibility that the band contractually agreed to the sphere launch, then Adam's back problem developed to the point of severity that he wasn't going to improve without surgery. And what better time to take a breather to recoup than a Las Vegas residency? Seems like the best possible opportunity to me, rather than a thing to get pissy about. Everything in Vegas is WAY less than 100% genuine.
Get over it I’m getting my tickets to the sphere and will seek them for the 7th time
People need to chill. It's just a residency. He's being subbed, not as if he's being replaced. Live, no one is gonna notice anyway.
Bono is like : Rick "with or without you" we're gonna do this.
Oh,I thought this was going to be a critique on Songs of Surrender because I finally got through all 40 songs and easily half of them are complete garbage. Bono's falsetto ruined several potentially good songs (like wtf was he thinking on Desire?)  Judging from the reactions on the 4 songs they released,I'm in the minority, but I stand by my opinion.
I feel the same way about ZZ Top. Huge fan, but they should've just called it quits once Dusty Hill passed away.
I agree with you but I’ve seen crap like this. Journey without Steve Perry. Van Halen without (list of singers). Fleetwood Mac without Lindsay Buckingham, Pink Floyd without Roger waters…. “Money changes everything.” (Love Cyndi Lauper)
Totally agree. Amen What a shame.  At this point of their lives...all of them in 60's....is that necessary ?  23 years without a great album....No Line only 2-3 Big songs...
I am not a big U2 fan.  I do like a lot of their stuff.  Rick is much more emotionally invested in this than I am.  My somewhat objective opinion is this looks like a money grab.  Larry Mullen jr. is crucial to their sound.  I guess a bunch of drunk people getting comped for a show, won’t notice the difference.    I would notice.  No drummer can sound like another.  It just isn’t the same.
I'm confused here coz bands finding temporary fill in musicians is very normal. Beatles literally did it for their first European tour when Ringo had tonsillitis and same with George briefly when he had a fever the day before their first taping for Ed Sullivan so they got someone to fill in for rehearsals. Larry Mullin Jr will be back as soon as he's recovered.
One of my earliest memories of songs playing on the radio is U2. I’ve seen them 4 times. I thought the special they did on Disney + was so strange not having Adam or Larry. I know Bono addresses why they’re not in it, but I agree with you Rick. U2 is all of the band in my mind. They had Paul as their manager their whole career until he retired. The band has always been a package deal. Sure, they can do what they like, and I will still love their music, but when I saw them in 2018 I was afraid their chapter of live performances was coming to a close.
Helge Schneider for the Win
My first thought was that maybe the sphere residency and super bowl add spot contracts were already signed and paid for before Larry's health issues came into light, and it was too expensive and difficult to back out?
This is slightly misguided in that Larry MJ wasn't particularly happy with the direction of the rhythm section - and more specifically the drumming - from Achtung's producers, Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno.  He wanted something closer to Joshua Tree.  So we have Lanois and Eno to thank for the industrial sounding and more dance influenced beats on that album, some of which reflected it being recorded in Berlin.  Yes, such a talented drummer was easily able to emulate their wishes, but he didn't inspire the concept of drumming on the album.  Bands often slot someone else in when one member is ill or injured, it doesn't feel particularly controversial to me.  You couldn't obviously do it without Paul or Dave, sorry Bono or the Edge!  However longer term let's hope he recovers and still has the verve to keep going.  He is a drumming legend.
U2 is a corporation more than a band.  See also Rolling Stones.
I'm not going to say any kind of opinion until Larry comes out and tells us what he thinks.
I love everything before and including No Line on the Horizon, but after that I just can’t listen to anything they’ve made. They’ve made nothing but blunders since then. It’s really kindof sad, but I’ve still got the memories.
There is no U2 without Larry. If they're going to do this, they need to call themselves "Me3". Me because it sounds like they're thinking of themselves over the band. SMH.
U2 tryna be depeche mode songs of faith and devotion to this day
Without Larry Mullen Jr., it's not U2, it's U minus 1. I'll pass.
Loved this take Rick! I am a diehard fan of U2 and I find the latest promo tour with just Edge and Bono  (Letterman, Tiny Desk..) a bit odd.  It feels ego driven. I know that's harsh but maybe it's time...
Old man yells at cloud.
Liked U2... until I worked as part of their local road crew. Total assholes, top to bottom in that outfit.
we  - the  -   audience .fans , listeners , consumers,  enjoyers of the  music played out by artists and bands who offer this to the world from the depth of their  being  - have little or no right  to expect them to act behave perform as we think they should...who are we to label categorize  judge  restrict or criticize them  ... we do not own them or their music... set the music free......let it play resound reverberate freee......shut up and listen....to the music.. gratefully ..joyfully
I picked up Boy at Believe In Music in Big Rapids, Michigan when it was released.  I dropped the needle on track one and heard two things - Bono proclaiming "I  Will Follow " and a cascade of drum beats that propelled the song and rest of the album into constant rotation on my turntable.   I've seen U2 going back to their first US tour and have no interest in seeing them without Larry.
Everything went downhill after Songs of Innocence. No Line on the Horizon was decent, but the “Songs of” duology was so underwhelming
I just have to say I have been a U2  fan since day 1 and grew up waiting for the next album to come out and witnessed first hand how their musical styles changed. From Boy to Achtung Baby were some of the biggest changes I've ever seen from a band musically. I was lucky to be at the Red Rocks show in 1983 and it was amazing.  Larry Mullen Jr.  and Adam Clayton were great but you're fooling yourself if you don't admit it's Bono and The Edge who are the backbone of that band and for me The Edge over Bono.  It's just a sign of the times. They're not the young men they use to be and every passing year counts. It is sad but so many other bands have toured when a member got injured, quit, got fired, or died. I guess U2 are now in that category. Bono's voice is not what it used to be and cannot sing many of the older, better songs in my opinion. Maybe their new manager will replace him also one day to keep the money train moving.
For the last 2 decades U2 has been nothing more than a vehicle to keep Bono relevant, the better to preach his politics to the world.
Zoo tv tour was their greatest. When you close with love is blindness the audience can't be anything than emotionally moved. All downhill from there. Allthough Popmart tour was ok, it just didn't get close to Zoo tv.
Achtung Baby is Larry Mullen. There is a reason why Zep called it quits after Bonham died.
Money and woke politics are driving this tired gravy train, not the love of music anymore.
Did The Rolling Stones stop after Charlie died? Castle mortgages add up!
Unfortunately 2U are not the only band who have no idea about their fans feeling and what some actions might cost them. Probably the potential one-time short-term big income totally corrupts long-term thinking process.
Goes to prove that drummers are interchangeable - althought bassists are the worst
It would not be the first concert without all the original members.  Technically there was one show in Australia where Adam was too polluted to play.  Them being a legacy act is obnoxious.  New material or let it go away.  Image if the Beatles were still around and did old album tours? Lame.  The only thing about this that’s good is they talked about a residency for a very very very long time.  Their politics are sideways, their rehashing old material and the stupid Lennon glasses are totally cringe.  I still hope one day they write a new song that blows my mind. I know they still can but don’t.
Something like $10million for U2 to be first at the sphere +more $$. Larry is admittedly physically broken/nerve damaged and needs time/surgeries to recover to get to where he needs to be to make new music.
Cheap Trick is about the only band that did a Vegas residency and didn't implode afterward.  That may be a slight exaggeration, but you get the point.  Songs of Surrender is nothing new...just basically an official bootleg of alternate versions of songs for people who can't get enough.   Put it all together and it's not something vital and exciting, but rather something that seems tired and desperate.  And please stop with the black and white mug shots of the band.  The record company is making them look like pedos who cut off their electronic bracelets and are on the lamb from house arrest.
love you Rick, but i really dont get what the dissapointment is about despite your explaining and YT comments... im sure its about something but just dont get it... they wanna do achtung series of shows in vegas and their drummer is not in best of health so they need a replacement/sessionist drummer... are you saying they should stop playing live as U2 because one member is temporarily not in play? if its about the ad during superbowl...then i REALLY dont get it lol maybe its an american thing... the significance of superbowl ads i mean... oh and please consider doing something from NIN in one of your WMTSG series, theyre awesome and have excellent elements in their songs especially Downward or Fragile album... despite being more of electronic/industrial im sure you'd still appreciate their musicianship
I've been a fan for like ever. But let's be honest they haven't done a good album in probably 20 years. I think there's just a certain time that some band should probably think about packing it up.
What's your take on Queen without Freddie then Rick?
well said.
They’ve lost there minds release new old songs as a new record
They should have followed The Police path- leave at the peak and allow your legacy to go on. U2 has become a bloated band that has nothing to offer- U2 should have retired longtime ago.
Larry Mullen Jr. is the drummer that made me want to play drums. I have a hard time thinking of U2 without him. It just feels wrong.
U2 got some bangers but real talk the rhythm section sounds like low sodium saltines topped w/ mayo
The company that owns The Sphere took out the ad.  They have invested more than two billion dollars building this facility.  The ad is to drum up business for The Sphere.  U2 is the first if many attractions.  Super Bowl commercials are supposed to create interest in products that generate revenue.  U2 is a pawn in MSG's empire.  A well compensated pawn.
Rick, I respectfully disagree.  I’ll take any sliver of U2 that I can get.
If Rick's friend, Rich, doesn't like it, you know something is up.  Rick's surname should also be obvious. *EVANS* U2 have a LOT of explaining to do.
Larry is dead
It's simply all about the money they really don't care about the fans.
This is like Jane’s Addiction touring without Dave Navarro with the sham narrative of him having long COVID. Buhhhhh
Beato says U2 enough is enough. After listening to Songs of Surrender I’m thinking does Beato know what he’s talking about? I mean for almost three hours U2 takes these songs just to new beautiful levels. I use to think Lennon McCartney were far better song writers, now I’m not so sure.
U2 doing Las Vegas residency?!  That’s where all great stars go to die.  No wonder Larry doesn’t want to do it, I think he has more pride, excuse the pun.  Sorry, but Las Vegas is the pits, and I’m surprised The Edge is game for it as well. Bono I can understand, he’s in retirement now I would say.  I doubt Clayton cares any more, the easy life now for him.  But Larry, hmm, I think he’s the most serious one in the band, the one least likely to sell out for easy money.
you are right
I have loved U-2 since their inception in the late 70's. It's tragic to me now how much they've sold out. Bono is a frequent Davos attendee and spends way too much time kissing up to the elites. Oh and it's Mount Temple, not Temple Mount. One of my best friend's went to the same school and I know the guy who was asked to join them as a keyboards player when they were called The Hype and he turned them down. Oh boy, did we give him grief :)
31 yo here. Been a fan since 2005 and Achtung Baby is by far my favourite album and I’ll definitely go see them - with or without Larry. This is the closest I’ll get to see Zoo TV and I’m here for it!
U2 without LMJ is the biggest letdown they could ever pull.
I think they just got tied into this with MSG Sphere early into the construction or planning of it as far as i remember here in local Vegas news. From the beginning there were rumors it was going to be U2 playing the opening. Honestly I think they need to push back the opening to make sure the venue is ready and give him time to recover.
If you're a grown man and you can't tell a good idea from a bad idea for your band you clearly don't give a sh**. I was a U2 fan and the last record I listened to was in fact Achtung Baby, from that point forward for me U2 was over.
AW WHO GIVES A FUCK? U2 has been U2 long enough to know what they're doing. And the idea that they're going to get just "some replacement drummer" is very ill thought out. don't like it? Don't go.
I think they were forced to do it without Larry because the Sphere is opening at a particular time and they're going to pay U2 BUNDLES of money to open the venue.  No one wants to turn down that cash or promotion.
As someone who’s attempted to play his parts,  I’d say Larry is tough to replace
Everyone needs to make a living.
Who in their right mind can say that rattle and hum is a “big misstep”? R&H, along with Achtung are U2s absolute best!
Relax !   But guess what ? ? They are going to have a Fill in Singer too ! !!
I unfollowed U2 when I saw them hanging with the WEF
Bono and Edge are illoyal asswholes. It`s as simple as that.
These bookings are made years in advance. Maybe Larry did not know about the surgery and convalescence when the ink was drying on the contract?    Nothing to see here. I have been a fan since War. They were asked to launch The Sphere but Larry can’t do it so Larry essentially blessed a temporary replacement.  End of story. My only disappointment is that Larry won’t be up there on stage, not with the decision making. Larry was part of the decision making. It was the right decision. Maybe he will show up and play some percussion?
Maybe Larry wanted them to do it...
U2 superfan, Rick Beato, bustin' U2's chops over the band's questionable business decision.  Pretty awesome.
Totally agree with you Rick. U2 is not aging well and have been too obsessed with money. Simple Minds are doing much better in their old days. As an aside, Achtung Baby is a good album, but it was past peak. U2 was at its best from War to The Joshua Tree (with The Unforgettable Fire, in the middle, their deepest album in my opinion).
Unpopular opinion. Casual U2 fans see Bono on stage and mayyyybe the Edge. That's it. And there are A LOT of casual U2 fans. One of my best friends is a huge U2 fan. Huge in the sense that he loves the songs. But very casual, if not clueless, with regard to the inner workings of the band itself. Saw them with him at MSG a few years ago.  Not once did we discuss personnel but he sang every tune at the top of his lungs.
I remember blur carrying on without Graham Coxon. Sacreligious!
Does U2 need the money this badly?   -  I shouldn't think so.   Are they obligated under some contract?  -  I'm sure there is a clause for illness or injury to a member. Is the new manager money hungry and telling Bono what to do?  {cough} So it begs the question of why?  Or at least, why not wait?  Honestly, they have lost their relevance since Achtung.  For 30 years they have been essentially a tribute band.  I think they really are wanting to get back in front of people because they (think they) need to be out there or be forgotten by the current generation of concert goers.  And I think that's wrong.  Their fans will wait.  They should too.
I once got 15th row tickets for Aerosmith and.....uh, er..REO (oh shut up). REO was out 2 months prior, Aerosmith comes out, no Joe Perry. Guy named Jimmy Crespo in his place.  Opening act was T-Bone Burnett and at that point I had never heard of him. Things were thrown at the stage.   Was a cpmplete waste and arguably the concert I remember most.
So Mullen can't play because of chronic back problems. It's not as if it was because of a conflict right? So if the band wants to continue, they have to do it with SOMEBODY. If Mullen has no problem with them continuing, I sure don't. This isn't a Van Halen soap opera type thing.
Had no idea about this, and it definitely sounds odd! Couldn't agree more Rick!
Interesting to compare and contrast U2 with Rush, a band of similar vintage. Geddy and Alex always saw Neil as being an integral part of the band and the performed together or not at all. They stood by Neil Peart when he tragically lost both his wife and daughter, and they've had the integrity/respect not to bring in a replacement after his death. As you've pointed out, this is about money more than legacy.
Rick - I could not agree more.  I am a fan from Australia, I have bene since 1982, my fondest memories are of listening to those first 4 albums on my tape deck in my room as a mis-guided teen.  Now I am an adult, I still listen to those first 4 albums with the fondest of memories.  They have gone well and truly beyond where their use-by date.  I'm not keen on this Vegas stint, nor am I keen on the Songs of Surrender album.  I had heard that they wanted to do an AB30 and from what I'd heard, was going to be the end of their touring, similar to what they did with Joshua Tree in 2017 - 2019, (which might I say was absolutely brilliant).  Because of COVID there was no chance they were going on the road at that time in 2021!  TO be honest, I don't listen to much of what they have released the past 20 years, except for some of what is on No Line on the Horizon.  I am not a fan of the past 2 albums, nor the Atomic Bomb album.
They told Larry “we’re gigging with or without you”.
They lost me after Under a Blood Red Sky.
The Beatles would  have eventually done a reunion tour if John hadn't been murdered.
That i-Tunes U2 record was annoying.  The cover art was pedo creepy, and you just could not get it off your playlist.  I must've deleted that album fifty times.
I wanna see Larry drum. Not a substitute!
Mount Temple not Temple Mount.
I can go further than that. I remember they were called The Hype, then U23 before they made it simpler with U2.
No one is getting into U2 these days because they like their new music so much.  I don't think it's so outrageous to imagine a new fan is into their 90s output the most
It seems more that Larry is a victim of organizational politics.   It appears corporate maneuvering and aligning by the other business interests both inside and outside the U2 corporation has yielded a new power structure different from the previous incarnation: the 4 band members and their manager Paul McGuinness operating as equal owners.  Now it seems the drummer has found himself in a severely diminished position despite his being a principal corporate owner and the founder of the organization itself.   This is evidenced by a recent public statement where he compared U2's internal management mechanism to a politburo.  He called it a benevolent dictatorship, and he said he was now questioning his ability and willingness to continue as an active member of the touring group(maybe even as a corporate owner).   While health reasons is the official narrative, his absence from the Vegas residency seems to be much more the product or symptom of some type of non-public internal power struggle amongst the principal partners and their corporate partners.
agree, what's the hurry
They could play with Larry through video screens like they did in zootv tour singing with lou Reed "live from the moon"
This is what every Van Halen fan said in 2007.  I agree with Rick. But the average fan went and saw VH and never missed Michael Anthony. If they did, it didn’t matter. And then the fanatics went because Roth was back.  Now we have Achtung Baby and Vegas. This will be successful because the two cool nicknames aren’t the ones missing. Sad but true.
How long, how long must we sing this song?
money grab.
Money
Larry is recuperating in 2023.  The rest needs to get the music muscles going so not to get rusty.  Prep for big tours when Larry is back.  U2 says chill.
That's actually grotesque
It's a corporate decision 💰💰💰💰💰 It's only about the fans paying them money now and buying the corporate sponsors goods and services. In addition to that, the first release or taste of reimagined 'Beautiful Day' is terrible and proves that Bono need lots of big noise around him to disguise his not so great voice. It's over, no Larry NO U2 .
I guarantee they didn't pay a penny for the ad. The Venetian is paying for it. I think is a good choice for them. It's effectively a 6-month practice session while Larry recuperates. For all we know, this surgery may be potentially career ending and he's given his blessing for them to continue with someone else.   I mean, would it be a problem if they weren't using the name U2? Perhaps call themselves SR-71 instead? Roger Waters and David Gilmour continue to perform Pink Floyd music under a different name.
Couldn't agree more. As a lifetime U2 fan, it really pains me to see the band make such ill-advised decisions. Isn't there someone close to the band (an advisor or friend)who has the nuts to tell them this is a horrible idea? Almost as bad as releasing Songs of Surrender- a reworked/remade compilation of 40 of their greatest songs just simply butchered.
Rick, As usual, You ROCK! Spot on; I've been a fan since the inception.
I swear every time this dude says, “U2”, he’s actually saying, YouTube.
I remember being in a Music store in 1983 and they played the video for New Years Day, I was transfixed, Been a U2 fan since. depending on the  day, different albums are my favourite, but War, The Unforgettable Fire, Joshua Tree, are far and away my favourites. I can't imagine them playing without Larry Mullen Jr., much like I can't imagine Rush playing without Neil Peart. I don't fault them, just don't know if I would pay to see them.
_"All bands break up, or at least they should at some point."_  -Rick Beato, 11/29/2021
2014 was where it all started going wrong
Old man yells at cloud.
Contractual obligation. With or without Larry.
No Larry, no U2...
Once again Rick you are right on the money.
Man I’m gonna get scorched for this. I’m 63.  My take on U2 has always been that they have terrific song writing and vocals, but only competent playing.  I think they are like the Stones in this limited way. Really great songs and an iconic front man carry the day.  They know swapping the drummer will not be a problem.  They just told us.
Bono needs to pay off his gambling debts to the mob, and he wants to kiss all his female fans.
U2 and Chilli Peppers who’s had the most disappointing back nine of their careers
I will never watch a show without Larry!!!
👌👌👌👏👏👏
As an avid U2 fan. I can see why this move definitely upsets people. I think it’s important to take into account that contracts for this were probably signed way before Larry had to get surgery. If anything this is being done with his blessing, we all know how close they are. Larry would want them to play
Larry is preparing to retire.  Getting rested and in shape for his Last Tour.  2026 will be 50 years.  Hype machine starts early.
Rick, I completely agree with you. It will not really be U2 in Vegas.
It appears U2 has been afflicted with lead singer syndrome.  Larry Mullen is as vital to the U2 sound as Edge or Adam Clayton or even their lead singer.  You haven't played for over three years; what is another year at this point?  Unless Larry has actually quit, then they should just come out and announce it.  If there is desire for privacy, and Larry is a pretty private guy, U2 should remain on the shelf until he is ready, even if that is forever.
There has to be a reason he can't or doesn't want to do it. If anybody is bothered by it, it wouldn't sell tickets, but it'll be a sell-out for obvious reasons.
Apple is never going to live down that U2 album thing. It doesn’t help that it’s one of their worst albums (in my opinion).
I m also a big U2 fan since the early 1980ies starting with the "unforgettable Fire" album. In general I don t think that a temporary replacement of a musician is a big drama under cercain circumstance. In case a tour is running and a drummer is ill and can t play for maybe two weeks - I think this was not a problem to replace the drummer for the running gigs during that time to be able to continue the tour. Of course this drummer needed to be able to play the songs of the tour in a good and acceptable quality. And it was nessecary to be honest with this problem and to say "yes we are playing this gig without Larry, because ... and we could find a fantastic drummer who will play tonight as replacement." - Of course it was impossible to replace Bono and maybe also very difficult to do this with the Edge, because they are much more present in the view of the audience. But of course as fan to be honest I would also expect to see the full band, but in a special case like described I would accept it. Because the alternitive was to cancel the concert.
No Lawrence? SACRILEGE.
Remember RHCP were considered "done" when Frusciante leaved for ten years.  They weren't.
Subtitles on this are so confusing, as YouTube captions "U2" as... "YouTube". So it took me a while to twig why Rick was saying he'd been a YouTube fan for decades... doh!
Megastars tend to be hostage to their lifestyle burn rate or high fixed expenses.  And the demands of the marketing machine around them.  They get into a channel where they can never stop touring, like a horse that's forced to keep competing until its last breath.
I watched them live on 30 November 2019, best concert experience inmy life, yet.  Yeah, kinda agree with you Rick, c'mon if you wanna go on the road, just wait untill Larry's recovered. What's the point of watching U2 live if it's not Bono-Edge-Adam-Larry??
I feel they already did the achtung nostalgia like ten years ago with the 360 tour and the album documentary. If they want to go vintage they should do All that you can't which didn't have a proper world tour
I swear bono and the edge did a small acoustoc tour withiut andy and larry. Why didn't they just dp this and male it like a vh1 storytellers gig to male it a 1 off event? Seems odd they are forcing a band environment gig for this las vegas show.
Might just be that Larry isn't   healthy enough to ever play again OR doesn't want to. They are getting on and some folk just want to take it easy.
I use to be a huge U2 fan but because of Bono and his politics I threw in the towel. I have seen them 8 times spending loads of money for tickets and travel and wouldn't attend a concert now if it were free.
They must be hurting for money.  After all, they haven't had a decent album since Rattle and Hum.
I’ll admit I had a mild panic attack when I read Larry wasn’t going to be playing with them. Once I found out why, I’m just hoping he is able to come back while they’re still in Vegas. As much as I want to see them live again, I would much rather wait till he’s back to spend the thousands of dollars it will probably take to fly there, get a hotel, see the show a couple of times and fly home. My guess is they’re contractually obligated at this point and can’t delay like they would a tour. Which really sucks for the fans that go to the early shows
Achtung Baby is Or 31 years, 3 months, 18 days today. All waiting for the 35th anniversary tour? :)
Bono definitely doesn't need the money the others might but not him.
Apple users who are offended for being spoon fed stuff they don’t want.  Just do an update and tell me we’re not sheep.  I admit it, I have an iPhone.  🐑
In over 40 years, this is the first time Larry's called in sick. I think we can give the band a break.
He's an aging drummer!! With numerous surgeries and injuries.
At least the Sex Pistols were honest about it and called it The Filthy Lucre Tour.
U2 had been my favorite band since Joshua Tree came out and  I still listen to them daily.  I'd mean the world to me to take my daughter to see U2 even w/o Larry.  Thankfully I'm not as jaded and bitter as you are.
One of the first bass lines I learned was the riff in New Years Day.. then I see a vid and this guy is playing what appears to be an Ibanez Musician like mine !! .. I've seen them 4 times since early mid 80's.. and worked 2 of their shows at the stadium that I luckily work getting the entertainment in and out of backstage.. and waiting on them and their entourages.. .. 56 Semi's and 100's of crew building that gigantic spider over 3-24/7 days..  sadly from backstage the sound sucked.. but one thing was certain.. All the Beats were Larry !!.. and As They Should Always Only Be. ..
I loved so much when a free u2's album appeared in my iTunes. It turned to be my favorite album from them... weeks later I went to the store to buy it physical.
Is Bono related to Sonny Bono 😂
FIRST THING I SAID, “no Larry Mullen Jr?! Why do it?!”
You could not be more right.  It would be like RUSH going on to play without Neil Peart.
If Larry can't play, he can't play. It's not like they can just make him. No decided "let's give Larry health problems so he can't play". Come on man, this wasn't a decision they chose, it's just something that happens when people age!
Love U2, and lived on Joshua Tree in ‘88 and ‘89 while serving in the military.
Well said Rick, complete money grab to do it without Larry The Founder on kit🤑
This would be like Rush replacing Neil Peart, except the Professor passed away.  Larry Mullen Jr did not
I hate U2. Always did. Shoving their stupid music onto my phone ensured I would never give them another chance.
Wow. When they gave thier album away for FREE and people were up in arms over it, I thought we don't have enough real things to complain about anymore. This is the society we currently live in. Rick, I love your videos, but I think this is the first one I've seen that seems like you're just whining. (One in how many good videos? I think your track record is safe!)
What is it about Bono that made you think this type of decision wasn't in play?   In fairness though,  we don't know what is going on with Mullen and his health...  and I don't blame bands like Journey for carrying on with the new singer,  although we all wish it wasn't so.
I really enjoy your videos and agree with much of what you say, but I found your entire thought process here to be off target. I think it's ridiculous to say that U2 shouldn't seize this unique opportunity to perform their seminal album Achtung Baby just because Larry will be recovering from surgery. It's not like they are kicking him out of the band, they are just going to do a few shows without him. I'm pretty sure that he is fully in support of this.
The ' fill inn' drummer is Dutch! ;-)
Couldn’t agree more Rick. U2 was my favorite band from the first time I saw them live in 85’ up until 2016. I was at that same show in Philly in 92’. The last 3 albums are putrid. Bono’s lyrics are beyond saccharine and benign. Bono’s ideology that once came across as genuine is now a desperate attempt at relevancy. They have played it very safe since Pop yet those tours from 01’ -06’ were great. They always said they would never play without an original member. Didn’t realize they were on their second manager since Paul.  I wish they would go away as this version of U2 is depressing.
walk away, walk away  I won’t follow
As a gigging drummer of similar age to Larry, I can say that sitting for hours at a time with you body weight directly on the spine takes it toll.  Your legs are effectively floating between your pedals so the body is balancing with a poor posture.  Larry a body must be destroyed after a world tour in his 60s.  Having said that, no Larry, no U2.   Get well soon Larry ❤
I believe life happens and the show must go on.
After “ All You Can’t Leave Behind “…..THEY SUUUUCKKKK….& I mean that with a STUDDER….sssuuss…sssuusscc….SSSUUUCCCCKKKSSS….SUCK!!!??
I think you missed a couple points... first off, the Apple phone thing... remember how much memory you on your phone back then... that was, I think the underpinning of the anger.  That may have played into the fact that people didn't like being asked, but I think that was the driving reason people were upset.  As for playing without a member who can't tour at the moment... the show must go on.  If he can't play with them at the moment what else are they going to do?  They are a band that plays as a band.  It's not like Genesis where three former members have charted with their own stuff.  They do band stuff.  The pandemic sidelined them, they want to start up, but they are a man down.  You get an understudy to step in until the main actor gets back.  /Maybe I'm bitter... my band's lead singer hurt his arm.  He said he couldn't sing well without playing (anxiety) and he strung us along for 9 months without saying he wanted to quit, time that we could have focused on rearranging the band.  At the end of the day, you want to play.  You have friendships, yeah, but if someone can't play for whatever reason, unless you just flat out kick them out of the band there isn't a loyalty issue, and in today's music world... I mean, are they going to be able to pick up someone who could have written all the drum parts for those albums?  That might be a long shot, but being able to find someone who can credibly play them?  Give the replacement guy a shot.
The first thing I thought too, was, THAT record is their most Larry record! And Rick, I was at that Philly show at the vet in 1992! Also saw them at the spectrum that tour.  I’m not interested in this Vegas thing, though it’s my favorite record. If they keep glorifying the past, I guess the future’s dried up. I still don’t begrudge them this, but I’m not interested. I’m also not finding songs of surrender all that interesting…
My music teacher in middle school told us, everyone is replaceable.
You cannot replace Larry Mullen Jr. It is impossible, it is like trying to replace Peart or Bonham.
"My Buddy Rich".. hihi... OK, I´ll grow up...
Rick, you got to chill. You are too much a purist. You freaked like this with Fleetwood mac. Bands get old and they go on like the the ship of the ship of Theseus.
There are VERY few bands in the same category as U2 in terms of membership "authenticity" and you named the two greatest - The Beatles and The Police. Every single member of each of those bands is fundamental to their band and each is totally irreplaceable, including Larry Mullen Jr.........if the guy is having surgery, then you postpone the residency until he's gig fit again, Simple.
Did Larry Mullen write all the drum parts on the records ?
Maybe three guys want keep playing and one doesn’t. Idk?
I guess in 2013 U2 stopped making music and politics, started making politics without music. And politics NEEDS MONEY!
How about 25% discount on tickets? You’re getting 75% of The Real Thing.
I was a fan until Achtung Baby. That was a good album, but I could hear them leaving their Irish roots behind and go commercial. Anything since then… AB was the transition for me. They had physically left Ireland, and that was that. They gave up the fight. But Bram is just a placeholder, his commitment is to Krezip, Larry will return. That’s the official position anyway
U2 burned out right after Achtung baby     They became a liberal- globalist- political  party band.         And a big investor into the big tech.    Th. Most annoying singer of all time … Bono      ( delete my comment Rick.  It’s all right )
No Larry = No U2
Risk, MSG (the Madison Square Garden group) that is building the Sphere for Billions, signed U2 before Larry's medical issues (it's been under construction for years) so for U2 to back out would cost U2 $$$$$. U2 is spinning it, but it really comes down to what it would cost them. Remember Adele backed out of a Caesars residency at the 23rd hour and hosed audiences and the Casino. So I think riders are in place if a group/person does back out to protect the venue.
They should have called Keith Moon
He had to have an operation on his back
Maybe they need to make some money to send to Ukraine
I here you Rick. Perpetual tours work for some unique bands= Dead, Phish, DMB. Can you do a video on why that seems to work?
I love your videos but here I disagree. Fans will decide if worthwhile. A lotta fans generally want to hear the front man, and yes the general groove. Mullen is a creative force yes, but much of his performances can be replicated. I saw the Stone Roses back for Second Coming when drummer Remy flaked. They thankfully kept the show with a fill in, and even tho he couldn't get the Fools Gold rhythm right, I m still thankful they performed, wouldn't have saw them otherwise.
I honestly don't think this is such a big of a deal as some are making it out to be. It's only a residency gig for what, probably a few months. They wouldn't do a world tour if he wasn't with them. The Sphere by all accounts is going to be the first of its kind and imo U2 are the perfect fit for the audio/visuals that it boasts have never been seen/heard before. Will it be the same without Larry, of course not, will they sellout every show, absolutely.
@5:45 I was born in 1987, my favourite band is Iron Maiden, my favourite records of theirs came out in 1984 and 1986. The idea that it is that unbeleivable that fans younger than the age of the record or fans the are new can't be huge fans of what you yourself claim are "monumental" records is quite something. Monumental records are that for a reason, because they span generations.  While I do think those people in the advert were fakes and actors, the idea that many people like that don't exist is not as unbelievable as you make it sound. For a band the size of u2 to not be getting new generations of fans would be more surprising tbh. If the band and the album is a monumental as you claim surely they should get new young fans. Anyone who starts gettting into standard rock music will probably find their way to U2 sooner or later, some will like it, some will hate it but they are a big enough band the the ear traffic giving them a listen will be high.  Steve Harris said that one of the best things about their live shows is how many young fans they see in the audience, that it isn't just old grey men but young boys AND girls.  I agree to not include a key member of the band sucks, it would be like Maiden playing without Nicko at this point.
I of course would prefer they play with Larry but being a life long fan and having not seen them live since Dec 2019, I’m still very much looking forward to this show. Especially at this new venue which will probably be amazing, and Achtung Baby is my second fav album just behind The Joshua Tree. You definitely make good points but 3 out of 4 members (as long as one is Bono) will be sufficient for me. Zoo TV tour is still the best tour I’ve ever seen.  I just pray that I can get tickets.
They are clearly desperate for cash, they're not doing a Vegas show for nothing. 2 years without touring they are essentially bleeding cash
Bono must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that
Now if this was Metallica, we all would be excited
I’ve been a U2 fan my entire life - 43yrs. I am not mad at this.   Hear me out : Larry is obviously ok with this. It’s not like they kicked him out of the band. I am sure that they agreed to this long before they knew Larry was going to need to have time away from the band.   That being said.. yeah the specific album thing is a little weird. It’s not one of my fav albums.. but I mean, is it really that serious?
Bono sang it years ago and it is true...especially for U2.  "You glorify the past when the future dries up."
I know it's just me, but I was sick of U2 before all the singles from War were released, circa 1981 (or somewhere thereabouts).  They're still making noise?
I wish Larry the best   But this is nonsense wait until he’s healed   Only way it would be acceptable is if he passed away and his son (if he has one?) and was taught by his father, filled in   Like seeing Pink Floyd without David Gilmour (I know this will piss off all the Roger Water fans)  And on and on
I'll be completely honest: I'm really not the biggest U2 fan. At all. I think they are (along with The Police and The Doors) one of the most overhyped and underwhelming bands of all time.   That said, it is not U2 without Larry Mullen, Jr. As when Bill Berry left R.E.M., they forged on, but it really felt like the "Buck/Mills/Stipe" project. It wasn't the same band. You can say what you want about Steven Adler as a person, but  "Appetite For Destruction" is as great as it is because of him.  A great drummer is worth his or her weight in gold.   There's a reason why LZ disbanded when Bonham died.  The same reason Rush called it quits when Neil died.  You don't replace those guys.  I'm not saying Mullen is on the aforementioned drummers' level. I'm saying if you take out his sound, it completely alters the feel of the band.
How much money would it take for me to spend many months in Vegas playing old U2 songs? Not as much as you'd think. Sounds fun. If Larry's ok with it (and being paid to sit home and recover?) then just enjoy the show, man. I also saw them in '92, but for the life of me, I can't remember where. Probably Chicago?
I think it's astonishing that this band has some need for additional capitol at this stage of their lives. Of course, this is what the LV residency is all about. There is NO other explanation. I believed iTunes "free album" fiasco was a glitch. A big glitch, but a comparatively small hick up in what's been a truly dream career. Personally, I've not really been into their music this century, but I was all over the first twenty years of it. I've seen theme a number of times, including the Zoo TV tour, which as Rick stated, was phenomenal. U2 should now be managing their exit strategy, which, let's face it, isn't that far off in the future,  by carefully picking and choosing releases and shows that keep their "fabled rock band" status in tact. But now, by making some bizarre money-grubbing decision, they have elected to squander pretty much all of that legend equity for a residency in one of the tackiest places on earth to see a show. Blue Man Group, Penn and Teller, Carrot Top and... U2. Damn...
Shame on one of my favorite bands for not sticking by their mate and putting the dollar signs ahead the loyalty and camaraderie.
Maybe Larry doesn’t approve of the Vegas Act thing, and just said something to the effect of, “if you guys insist on doing this vegas oldies show thing, you might as well do it when I’m having my surgery, because I don’t like it, we don’t need it, and I won’t do it.”
Hey Rick, love your videos always! Even though I don't like the idea of U2 playing without Larry, he's not being replaced by some random drummer. Bram vd Berg is the drummer from very successful Dutch band Krezip. Their stuff is very nice :)
The Beatles did a tour of Holland without Ringo. Had a "fill in" guy called "Jimmie Nicol". Actually a really good drummer and could really rock. Thirteen days a Beatle!
I mean... Is ANYONE going to see them for Larry? Whoever is going to Vegas is paying for Bono and the Edge, right? Larry's DEFINITELY going to get his cut. So what's the problem?
I loved the Album, and think it’s their best. Even if I could be in Vegas, It would be an incomplete experience without Larry.
Example: I was born in ‘81. I never saw Jeff Porcaro play with Toto. I started listening to their music in 1992 when he had just passed away. Yet all those twenty plus shows I saw them live were absolutely great. What’s your point? Is it melancholy?
"That's like your opinion, man" which is pretty narrow
The Drum intro to "bullet the blue sky" is as iconic as John Bonham's intro to "when the levee breaks". Just as Led Zeppelin couldn't go on without Bonzo, I don't see how U2 can go on without LMJr.
Somehow it seems like they were contracted to open the sphere quite a while ago and then Larry announces that if U2 tours in 2023 it will be without him as he has significant overuse injuries that require surgery before he will be fit to play/tour again. Not sure why he hasn’t done it in last 4 years. It almost sounds like they committed to opening the sphere without consulting everyone or at least not Larry. I think they have to open the building with or without him.
They're a band on mission, and the show must go on! 🎉 (Rick's just upset they didn't ask him to fill in for Larry on drums😉🥁)
I'm out.  I fell in love with U2 in 1990.  I went back through their catalog, and it was fantastic...I went forward with them through even through parts of No Line...the last two albums are dreck, and now they're rewriting old songs making new dreck.  Songs of Surrender is a disaster for me.  I can't do it anymore....what happened?
♥
6:19 "Yes, some bands replace people and go on." Was that "Yes" accidental? :D
The gig doesn't make sense because I believe only once a bandmember missed a show, that was Adam Clayton in Australia Zoo TV outdoor broadcast. So this move without a band member is very un U2ish and inappropriate IMO.
‘Dear U2, what are you thinking?’ is what have screamed internally at the release of all of their albums since 1999.
😂 Totally lovin it Rick. You’re absolutely right, what the frigg 🤷🏻‍♂️ How do you not go out without your drummer who founded the band and is absolutely one of the most underrated drummers of all time, his drumming is out of this world.
Mount Temple, not Temple Mount :)
U2 would become living legends if they broke up 20 years ago.
Maybe they feel like WTF if Vince Neil can STILL be out on stages why cant we...  If fans are that loyal to sit thru that fiasco.. Jump on that covid crackhead profiteering bandwagon like everyone else. After all they can now charge 10x or more what tickets were the last time they played and they wouldn't have to go on the road and people will pay it..
U2 are the worst thing to happen to Ireland  since England
Their political affiliation through the years should tell you enough about who they really are. Love their music. Hate the band.
U2... They are...... :)
Larry: Guys, I can´t go to the Super Bowl gig... Are you guys still gonna do it? Bono: With or without you...
U2 used to be cool. Now we can see , "Bone-O' is a globalist shill. With his anti-white comments.  What a joke.
got bills to pay!
The whole thing is really bizarre. They don't need the money so why do this?
The fifth member is the pedals that play the Edge's guitar :p So overrated.
It's only about the MONEY..MONEY..MONEY.  Oh we miss the fans,  yes, you miss the fans money. It's such a joke when these die hard fans complain about their much loved bands touring without their original members. The band members don't care about you and what you think, they are in it to make money. The music industry is a business and the business is to make money. To Quote a famous movie line, "Greed IS Good".
thats not always the band fault .. is the fault of the people that always saw bands as "singer + random musicians", take the case of the GnR 1996-2016 period .. or Janes Addiction touring without Navarro, wtf... the bands are the people  NOT a name...
Money talks 🤑
brilliant!!
Its al about the money, Simple Minds are doing the same. Drummer Mel Gaynor left en Mick Mc Neil thit and the old Bassplayer. Im also a drummer if the band members want to move on ure out. Big ego's think only about money.
Watch the entire Elevation tour video - one of the most genuinely exciting live captures I've ever seen by anyone - and imagine it without Larry Mullen. No way.
If he's injured, he's injured. Adam Clayton's bass tech played gigs in Australia back in the early 90s, and they  didn't break up..
Rick, you are maybe the only one who gets this. It drives me insane that U2 is doing this. U2 is the full band; not Bono. Not Bono and Edge. If Edge had to have surgery, bet this isn’t happening. It’s a slap in Larry’s face. This is yet another money grab; as is Songs of Surrender (which is the worst U2 release to date). Bring back Paul McGuiness because they have been lost since he left.   U2 used to be the “gold standard” that I always felt was a rung better than REM and Pearl Jam and the like. They showed them all how it was done. But now, I really think U2 is quickly becoming a novelty act.
U2 should call it quits.
I disagree. bono and the edge wrote those songs mostly, if I wrote so many of the greatest songs of all time, no one guy is gonna stop me singing them. If Larry is just recovering and will be back to playing in a year or two, then yes, they should wait for him. But if there is more to it (which I suspect there would be) then they should play if they want to play.  As for the Apple thing, I don’t think anyone would have been able to predict that giving away a free album from one of the greatest bands of all time would not be received well. If you think you could have predicted that, you are fooling yourself.
Little surprised a fan would be so surprised about no Larry - he’s been saying or at least hinting in interviews for months that if they toured it wouldn’t be with him
Purist overreaction?  I assume you stopped listening to the Who after Keith Moon died?
Rick, if Larry does this residency he will possibly never play drums again. The surgery he’s had is pretty major and does need a year off.   Also U2 played their first concert in Sydney in 1992 without Adam (he was too wasted from the night before). His guitar tech, Stuart Morgan stepped up and played for him. It was still a brilliant concert and I would argue bass is just as important as drums.  The point is even if you don’t agree with this (I don’t but only because I’m overseas and jealous I can’t get to Vegas for it) it’s been a long time between drinks as far as live performances are concerned. Maybe it’s a warmup before the next album and world tour. Yeah, there’s no Larry but I’m sure you’d have to agree his health is more important. Will be interesting to see how Bram Van Den Berg goes.
What's an MSG sphere? A big ball full of monosodium glutamate? That should get the crown going!
I was at Red Rocks in 1983 for 'Blood Sky'... I was freezing and wet, but so very happy.... and high.... LOL I was 22. ♥
Oh poo poo. They're a band that plays whenever, wherever, with whomever they chose. U2 is a product that doesn't need your opinion. Express it away. You have no say so
Buddy, rich.....unintentionally...or?
Love the channel Rick!  I CAN believe how much it's grown over the last couple years I've been watching.  Keep it up!
I would love to see Acthung Baby in Vegas.
Everyone loves the band Youtube. Note the title when scrolling or pausing around  2:43 to 6:52
Let's all be honest, the drummer is the most replaceable  member of a band, and I'm a drummer.
...dude, Larry NEEDS surgery, he's in PAIN... trust me, BRAM, who has been Larry's drum tekk, will hit every 'Larry drum part' perfectly... and you'll do just fine...
Playing Achtung Baby without Larry is “So Cruel”.
A statement on the band's website said: “Larry will take time out to undergo and recuperate from surgery in 2023.”
I heard some months ago that Larry Mullen, Jr. just flat didn't want to tour anymore. He's just tired of it.
Is Charlie Watts still playing the Stones concerts ?
They told Larry *we are doing this gig With or Without You "
What I found more baffling is that Larry effectively had two years or so of definite down time during Covid and he chooses the first year that the band will likely be able to get on the road again to mend his back. Anyway, U2 can do whatever they want in this regard with respect Rick. As long as they are servicing their fans everything is permissable
Achtung baby is a terrible terrible album. Period.
That is horrible, I always respected the band for sticking together that long. I think that is total slap in face to Larry and just cash grab. I am really big u2 fan and it sad to see this.
The Vegas residency is a money grab for lazy musicians. No traveling, bringing the music to the fans, no hotels. You have to travel to them. Billy Joel, Motley Spew and others have all taken the lazy road of has-beens and gotten extremely more wealthy.
R.I.P. the band that change my life since the early 80's, I'm watching the funeral, and I'm very sad 😢.
I was born in 1967 and am one of the biggest Beatles fans ever. I would kill to see Paul or RIngo live one more time even if they only played Beatles songs during the show. I didn't discover Kings of Leon until their 3rd record, but Youth and Young Manhood might be my favorite. My sons are 18 and 20 and both love Nirvana.  I hope I'm making my point here. 😁 While I don't love the SB ad part of it, but I don't find fault with them playing some shows with a fill-in drummer. Although I hope Larry will be back again with the band in the future.
BEEN  IN  MANY  LOCAL  BANDS...........LOYALTY  TO  ONES  MATES  IS  NOT  ALWAYS  A  THING  !
They probably signed contracts to do the shows a couple of years ago before they realised Larry wouldn't be able to play. If they don't fulfill the contract my guess is they would get sued. I could be wrong but that may be the reality...
I agree Rick! It’s kind of whack they are doing this! I have to believe he gave his blessing on this! Maybe there is something we don’t know🤷🏻‍♀️ I’m glad there are doing some shows but…..😒 The band is the band though and that should always include all 4 original members!
WILLIAM HUNG AND KENNY G SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE HEADLINERS OF THE SPHERE
William hung and milli vanilli and vanilla ice should be the headliners instead of u2….also live aid Led Zeppelin
I hope William hung also headlines the spheres
i feel weird about it too but i feel like that wasnt just an easy decision on anyone's part. Larry's not doing great, clearly. I'm sure the Stones and the Foo's also wish they didnt have to...but they have to keep going. Hell, even dream theater were able to find a "replacement"... you gotta keep moving  :(  As a drummer who had to stop playing permanently due to injury, nothing would break my heart more than seeing my band-mates lay down and die. PS. the apple thing still makes me laugh. What a case study for so many college classes ahah
Talking about over rated bands
Play a fckin U2 beat !!!
I’ve seen them 113 times. My first show in 1987 at RFK when Bono slipped in the rain, fell, and dislocated his shoulder. It makes me sick to think they’re going to play this show without Larry. I too was at Aloha Stadium for Vertigo at the make up show they did because of Edge’s father. I won’t be in Vegas without Larry.
This is a weird gatekeeping rant. They have every right to continue playing in front of audiences if they want to. They almost certainly don't need the money, so it seems they do enjoy playing for live audiences. Nothing wrong with that.  And, you know, if they want to make more money and people are willing to pay, then more power to them. The people will tell them either which way if this was a good idea or not by showing up or not.  The same as you mentioned about people maybe just not listening to the auto-loaded U2 album on iTunes, just don't go to the show if you don't want to see them without Larry Mullen Jr.   In case it matters to anyone's thinking at all, LMJ said sometime last year he would not be playing with the band in 2023 because he needed surgery to be able to keep playing. So, this shouldn't have been too much of a surprise.
U2, one of the most overrated bands ever
I agree not cool
What is your opinion on the Stones then? After Charlie died especially
If they miss their audience why play 80 nights for basically the same audience?
U2 came together one day in the Mullen residency kitchen, where Edge's brother was also trying out for the band. They should just postpone the gig so that the person who started the band, can be present.
I have all of their records up through All that you can't leave behind, except for Pop which I didn't care for. Joshua tree still my favorite by them. I heard Larry is having surgery which is why he won't be on the new residency. I get what you're saying and no disrespect to drummers but its not like they're going on with axl rose singing the vocals in place of Bono. Now that would be crazy
U r right Rick! U2 are not U2 without their founder Larry Mullen jr. Larry said in an interview that he isn’t up to howl at the same gods as bono and Edge do! whatever that means🤷‍♂️ Sounds like heavy beef among the best band in the world!
LOVED U2 from 83 to 97. Saw them in ATL for UNFORGETTABLE FIRE tour. Pretty much stopped listening after Y2K.
Just don't go Rick the tickets will be expensive anyway stay home and play your drums
truth brave, 59 palms
Guess you think the Stones should stop too since Charlie died or should have stopped earlier when Bill Wyman left.
U2 sold all their moral principles a long time ago for a lot of tax-free money.
I respect you are a long term fan but you misunderstand a couple of things here , bono confirmed in his book that the album giveaway Apple idea was his , not old or new managers ,he pitched Tim Cook in Apple and he admits it was the wrong call / secondly , the live nation contract was the foundation of the idea the band be the opener for the new state of the art MSG venue opening fall 2023 , unfortunately with this timing of the venue they had to decide to either go ahead without Larry who cannot play at this time or else decide they would indeed be the opening artist for this venue , not them just announcing a tour without Larry as you intimate , of course after 40 years they would prefer all band , but the opportunity to open new msg venue in Vegas could be passed and the band may never play live again as a unit anyways , so personally if the choice is 3 U2 in Achtung Tour for opening MSG sphere in Vegas or maybe no U2 tours ever again / then il settle for this , if they decided not to bother we would be saying they should have compromised to make it happen rather than some other band replace them imo
Well done Rick you are one of us , we are U2ers for life , since 1984 here , greetings
If you don't want to let down your audience, wouldn't you just delay the shows until your founding member drummer is physically able to play?
Show business is a business. The Sphere has been in development since before COVID. U2 was contracted to be the grand opening and the specialized media assets for the Sphere are probably as costly as any tour. I think they’re on a train that can’t be stopped just because Larry is sidelined right now. Otherwise they would cancel or postpone?
I still cannot wrap my head around why Cheap Trick and Bun E. Carlos are not together after some on and off
I was a fan of U2 from the 70 until                                              I'm not a Christian (nor any organized religion) they started doing satanic CGI shows.                                       But Satan games are RIGHT OUT~!
What is really wierd is the ad, so creepy.
I could be wrong but maybe Larry doesn't want to go to Vegas for a year to do hard work. What if he just wants to enjoy the rest of his life the way he wants it, he has earned and deserves this freedom? Perhaps it's not that the band mates kicked him out, but more like he is the sane one when the rest of the band turned senile and are on a highway to Zombieland. The desire of a once large than life band to stay relevant not throught their legacy but through permanently being on stage might attract new fans yet it might turn away the old ones. Let's see what happens, it's going to be a great experiment, not so sure about the show though.
Perhaps - just perhaps - this sis something to do with the ego and . . . . huge amounts of . . . money.
That’s a good ONE!
I think if U2 had chosen a son (or daughter) of Larry’s or of any of the band members for that matter, to fill in for Larry, a lot more people would be ok with this decision to play on like this.  Genesis, Van Halen, and the Eagles all had their super talented kids up their playing and it was great in every instance.   Nic, Wolfgang, and Deacon all gave the air of legitimacy being up there on the stage bc they are the offspring of the original band members.   U2 have to decided to go out there with a hired gun like The Who and the Stones have done before them (unlike Rush and Zep who didn’t tour any further without their drummer)  If they wanna play, all the more power to them, but this sits really wrong with me.      I suspect a full World Achtung Tour will follow in 2024. I just hope Larry will be back onboard for that, otherwise this seems really disingenuous from a band that used to be all about sincerity.  I don’t mind them going out to play the classics if they know they don’t have a great album left in them, but I’ve read they’re writing a new album too, so I don’t know really what to make of this.  I just can’t see why they couldn’t wait for Larry IF he is coming back, but I guess that’s the unanswered million dollar question as of right now.
agreed...comes down to greed. 😊
@RickBeato I just don't understand the point of them doing this (aside from the massive pay day... which, by any reasonable assessment of their wealth, they don't need). Sure, it's easy and somewhat naïve for someone like myself and most/all of us who are not in a multi-platinum selling, supper successful, legendary band to sit around on the internet and say, "well what you should do is..." Frankly, it reminds me of a bunch of guys at the bar, three beers deep, screaming at the TV about how, whoever on the Yankees, just needs to do XYZ in order to turn his season around. Be that as it may, it's hard for me see how the band thought that this, and frankly the series of choices they've made in recent years, would accomplish what they ostensibly say they'd like to accomplish. Bono has gone on and on about his desire to stay relevant. He's backed off from that sentiment a little bit in the last year or so, but it's clear that he'd love a re-do of the early 2000's (or mid-80's, or early 90's). I think they're realizing that's not going to happen.   At that point a band in their position has two options: blow it all up and do something fresh and interesting (which they've done and it was AWESOME *cough* Achtung *cough* Baby) or lean into the machine and milk it. Unfortunately they're choosing the latter.  They did the whole "let's play our biggest album on tour" thing (credit where credit is due, I saw them on the JT tour and it was awesome, regardless it doesn't exactly say "we're here, we're relevant, listen to us!") Their latest "album" is just an acoustic re-recording their old songs...changing some lyrics... I don't know, who cares?  I wasn't sure how much louder they could scream "we've run out of ideas and have no clue where to go from here!" until this gem of an idea came about.   All that's to say, here's my armchair, BS, no one cares, screaming at the TV three-beers deep opinion on one of my favorite band's recent rash (like nearly a decade's worth...) of completely tone-deaf decisions: You did it, not once but multiple times, do it again - tear it all down and start over. Screw the money, you're richer than Croesus. Forget competing with pop stars,  or being "relevant."  Forget the stupid gimmicks like Las Vegas spheres or iPhone security intrusions. Don't go to Las Vegas and do the whole "play a hit album back to front" thing without a founding and pivotal member of the band just to suck money away from whoever happens to be rolling through town. You're better than jockeying for a spot on the vacationing boomer's post-buffet night out (or at least you should be). Competing for that dollar against Maroon 5 and Garth Brooks actually does the OPPOSITE of what you have openly said you want to do. So ignore all that nonsense and focus on making meaningful art that makes sense to you and take the risk that it, the music - not some gimmick- may or may not make sense to others as well. It's what you did in the 90s when you were in post-Soviet Berlin and when you were hanging out in the East Village to catch Jeff Buckley shows. You just cared about art and putting your fingerprint on it. Do it again. There's nothing to say you can't.
I became a U2 fan listening Achtung Baby and Zooropa, and it's very disappointing to see what they are doing in the last years.
This venue was supposed to open last year. My guess is, U2 agreed to this a while ago and then the project got delayed because of COVID. Cut to the end of 2022 and Larry is told he needs surgery or else he may never drum again. There is probably a lot of money on the table that would be lost by saying no at this stage. Or maybe, just maybe Larry says I will play and injure myself or you get a replacement for me, but do not turn this down!
Right on, Rick. Correct on all points. I would add that we are 31+ years since one of their twin tower albums was released. Why not wait till Larry has recovered?
Couldn't agree more.  I love all of those earlier releases up to Achtung Baby.  And to hold a concert without Larry Mullen Jr is selfish imo.  Larry is intrinsic to the band and to cheat the fans out of hearing him play is tantamount to a betrayal.  The fans don't want 75% of U2...they want the whole meal deal!
It's like the Who without Keith Moon. It's like the Rolling Stones without Brian Jones . It's like the grateful Dead without Jerry Garcia.   It's like Sonny and Cher without Sonny. It's like the Crickets without Buddy Holly. It's like the Neville Brothers Without Aaron.
One of only times I will disagree with you. Superfans like me have been hoping for an Achtung Baby tour or set of shows for a few years now. The album still sounds like it's from the future. Covid quashed any plans to coincide with the album's 30th anniversary. LMJ is said to be fully supportive and will most certainly have his own healthy payday as an owner of the overall enterprise. These guys ain't getting any younger and any chance to see their live shows and the Edge is a gift. The last couple tours have been so damn good the last couple tours, and I date back to seeing the Unforgettable Fire tour when I was 13. This was no doubt a great deal for the band and their entire extended crew to play when they, and especially that crew, would otherwise be sitting on the sidelines. MGM is pumping major bucks in this Sphere thing and trying to draw people back to Vegas, and that's who funded commercials. Love, love, love your channel and breakdowns. See you in Vegas ✌
I think, to a certain extent, having replacement members for a tour or a residency can become inevitable as bands age. The cause can be anything from health problems, to regular band animosity, to fatigue. People handle things differently, and at different speeds.   I remember a roadie having to play bass at one point on a tour because Adam was having, if I remember correctly, alcohol related issues and missed some shows. I remember him saying it was a wake up call for him regarding not only his place in the band, but also the fact that a roadie could step in and play his parts. The experience helped him not only sober up, but he re-dedicated himself to improving his skill on the bass.
I don’t think I have ever seen you this upset.
Mentions Pearl Jam the band which has had more drummers then anyone. I think U2 will be fine.
My first thought, without watching the video (watching it now) was that Larry is having (back?) problems again. Just like during the Pop sessions.
I’m with you on this Rick 🤙🏻
Pop Mart was good I thought, along with Zooropa
Mount Temple comprehensive
Dear Rick, I think you are "Stuck in a moment you can't get out of." Bands should be allowed to progress and morph over time. I think U2 not formally recognizing the long time keyboardist as the fifth member of the band is a much bigger deal.
The apple thing was horrible…stupidity beyond belief…it made me really turn away from u2
A Simple Google search shows the LMJ needs to have some significant surgery and stated last year already that he would not be able to do any gigs this year in order to recoup.  While I fully agree that U2 will not be complete without LMJ, I do not think that it is so outrageous.  They clearly are a band that loves to be in front of people.  What better way to do so than a Las Vegas residency while LMJ recoups, to go back to stadiums at a later stage.  Nothing wrong with that.  Following Bono's book, they clearly are a band of brothers, so why should they stop performing.  Last I checked when they tour, they usually outdo other artists who tour in terms of selling out stadiums.  So again, why stop touring.  I think, in any event, that most Las Vegas residencies are watered-down events anyway...so what a great opportunity to still make some money, spend time in front of fans and give the heartbeat of the band to recoup.  I will venture that it will still be a great gig.
For me, U2 started a downhill trend after Unforgettable Fire.
They're musicians who want to play their music!  If one is not available they should be able to play their music without him.  No offence but you music geeks can get too sensitive.  They have enough money, they just like playing their music for audiences.  Chill out!
Bono doesn't have the record. He IS the record.
Perhaps after this their new manager will be experiening "The unforgettable Fire"
Hah...being commercial I suppose, me knowing about Larrys surgery and such and them venturing out in Vegas? Ouch. Bad move, hope they rethink that decision aye?
You know where I really feel like this is such a slap in the face to Larry? During a leg of that Vertigo tour Rick was talking about, one of Edge’s children got very sick. I’m sorry that I don’t remember with what but I think it could have been cancer related. Parts of the tour were cancelled so Edge could be with his family. The second time around for U2 to play America on their 360 tour, Bono gets hurt riding his bike. They postpone the entire leg and play it two summers later. So, Edge becomes unavailable tour gets postponed. Bono gets injured tour gets postponed. Larry needs surgery and rest, the hell with him we’ll find someone else. That disappoints me as a huge U2 fan who will not be paying the crazy money they charge me for every concert if I’m going to then watch 3/4 of the band perform.
WTF you sound like a Karen time to pack it in oldman
Rick I agree I feel doing the Las Vegas residency is very tacky for one, and they shouldn’t tour or perform with out their long time band member and so after Larry gets better.
What U2 is is not up to you to decide but to them. Makes me think of people going round saying, "Pink Floyd without Syd Barret has no future" or, "The Rolling Stones without Brian Jones are not The Rolling Stones", or even, "We want Pete!" Probably people did say it at the time but in retrospect it may seem absurd. And yes, Larry is important for the band, but maybe we have just got too used to the formula of those four men, like the world has got used to the formula of Coca Cola. The fans don't get to decide who is part of U2, let alone who plays or does not play a certain gig.
Achtung Baby is not centring around Larry Mullen Jr, it's a complete falsehood. Obviously, they were all important for the album, but none more so perhaps than Bono and The Edge, without whom the "sound of four men chopping down the joshua tree" would never have been heard. Larry Mullen was at first opposed to going in a completely different direction. I can't help feeling that you are so enraged by their going on the trip without Larry that you forget these central facts.
Larry's back is shot.  That's why half the drums on Pop are programmed.  It's 100% health.
I guess there's a certain momentum behind a Las Vegas residency once you throw the switch.  We've got <trademarked sports event> ads, we rebuilt a theatre, the online ad campaign is in full swing.  Your drummer was healthy when we signed, a deal's a deal.   Even U2 has no power to delay the opening date.
Something to do with contracts, money, insurances etc. Bram will do a good job, whether you agree or not.
In my opinion the last acceptable U2 album was Achtung Baby, from then on everything went from fair to bad. Something similar happened with Depeche mode, since Alan Wilder left the albums were barely acceptable compared to the previous ones.
Hey, it might be Larry's kid Ezra (also a drummer) filling in for him. Might be interesting. Or even Ryan McMahon from Inhaler :)
I would venture to guess, it is all down to pre-arranged contractual obligations.
The Beatles plated with the another drummer for a couple of months when they had Ringo. It is not personal with Larry.
We'll miss Larry, but relax. He'll hopefully be back next year and many fans will be grateful to hear U2 in Vegas this year. Life is short. Grateful they keep coming back to show us a good time. See U in Vegas.
Take care as a drummer obviously, if you hope to play throughout your life. The spine takes a knock when carrying the kit and other gear when you are young and it reminds you for the rest of your life. For some of us, it means we can hardly play/walk due to the pain and it is incredibly sad to give it up drumming and of course functioning as an active person.  I hope Larry recovers from his health problem but I think it may be that his back has finally given up on him and no amount of money a person has can help deaden the continuous chronic pain without becoming addicted to strong pain meds. Using strong pain meds is another health problem in its own category. Maybe Larry's bandmates should say well that's it for this musical group. We /he has given his all.  Time will reveal the true story.
U2's interesting albums finish with No Line on the Horizon for me. That was 14 years ago.
Larry can't play he needs surgery
Spot on, was gob-smacked to read this, what on earth were they thinking?!
Agree, time to call it a day. Saw U2 in the very early days in Ireland (1980), supporting the Police in a field outside of Dublin and many times following that gig. Lost interest in recent years and have no desire to see them live again. I do, however, listen to the older albums once in a while, anything up to and including Ashtung Baby. Maybe Larry agrees that it's time to give it up ?
Larry Is probably 90% of why I love U2 so much. Like he’s said, it’s all about the drums. And it is. No Larry, no U2.
U2 is playing at an amazing new venue in Vegas. Bands perform live all the time without their original members. What's the big f**king problem? People today just like to be miserable and always complain about something.
U2 - 1
For many, Achtung was U2's final album...  it was a 'warning' haha...
I started following U2 and became a fan when they were young and out there out on a mission.  To spread the word about love, justice, hope, bring dignify and make a new generation aware of leaders like Martin Luther King (MLK and In the Name of Love) and Nelson Mandela.  They were considered by some Christians although I don't think they accepted being think as such.  How the "music business" have changed since those days!!!!
There has never been a band more motivated by the almighty $$$...absolute money grubbers, one and all.  But Rick, you seem to be awfully sensitive about Mullen's absence. Who cares, really? And how do you know that the others don't have his blessing to play the Vegas gigs without him?
basically fans would love to see bands keep playing until they gone. sad really.
I used to be a HUGE U2 fan, but I've been put off by Bono's political stunts (besties with some nefarious Bills) and their newer music not really being that good. As they've aged, they've lost their edge (pun intended). I really believe they had a heart to be a voice for people in need back in the day, but over time they just seem to be about the money grab.
Ever seen a u2 gig with a missing band member? Yep. Zoo TV Sydney 1993, the night before they filmed the concert. Bass guitar technician Stuart Morgan stepped in to replace Adam Clayton who apparently had a "mystery illness" (read the book U2: At the End of the World for more info). Was it still a u2 gig? Yes. I saw Lovetown back in the late 80's and I had a view to the side of the stage and I swear I could see another person drumming off stage. I saw u2 again in 2006 and they should have called it the "going through the motions" tour. They seemed to lack that spark I saw many years before. I said I'd never see them again and I haven't. So far from what I've heard, "Songs of Surrender" sounds like a band butchering u2 songs. u2 is at the risk of becoming a parody of themselves. If Las Vegas is the only way you can see them then go do it, without Larry it will be a u2 of sorts, but maybe it's best to pull out your old dvd's of Under a Blood Red Sky or Zoo Tv to see what a great live band they once were.
Some bands just rather die an embarrassingly slow death. others know when the party's over.
same when deftones went on tour recently without Stephen Carpenter, now its mainly cause he's against the vaccine which i got no problem with him being against it, but then the band still decides to go on a european tour without him, its stupid, if you're going to do that then you should cut the ticket price in half, i mean sure deftones you want to hear Chino, you can't do it without that, but just as big for me a guitarist is watching Steph play his 8 string guitar, i don't want to pay 200 bucks to see some random dude they literally said in the press release "our buddy jeff from sacremento is going to take over on guitar for the upcoming shows" its just treating fans like bank machines, there was another story just yesterday some rap group played a show, theres like 3-4 guys in the group and the concert only one of them showed up, thats bullshit.
I've liked U2 since the beginning. But, like in your recent post about why we fall away from artists we love, I have not really paid close attention to them for years now. Add to the mix this lovely news and well...let's just say I don't feel guilty for moving on. Wish Bono and the rest all the best. Am sure they won't suffer without my support. ✌
Like U2 but not a thrill.. Achtung Babe and Joshua Tree, and Sunday bloody Sunday were good.. But never blow my mind.. Saw the in 94 good production, Satelite of love of Lou Reed, sundely Bono dress as a devil or something.. Got a DVD from concert in 2000 something.. It's OK.. I think that Edge plays with to much pedals and stuff like that.. There's a video on YouTube several years ago with Jimmy Page, Edge and Jack White.. Page giving a lesson of Kashmir... The best band in the world and live are the Stones.. Just pure rock and roll.. And great Riffs from Keith, as always..They are not virtual guitarrists but only strong riffs and great Rock.. A great guitarrist was Mick Taylor but Ronnie fits perfectly with the band.. Charlie Watts was one of the best drummer ever.. Simple drums and great swing and strong rock.. The old Dixie's school with rock and roll school..! U2 in several concerts in Las Vegas.. Well.. I think it gives a lot of Money and is bored to travel.. Bought a ticket in 2019 to Aerosmith European tour 2020...Keep it.. In 2022 this "band" canceled the European tour 2022 because of Covid 19, full of apologizes... They go to Las Vegas to make twenty or more "concerts"... Casino bands now... Decadence..
Original members, or nothing.  IMHO.  I understand that business contract was probably signed prior to the surgery on Larry's back took priority.  We may never know. I close with the notion, "money talks and bull#$@t walks"   Money does things to people
Is all about money, money worsipers ....
Dear U2, what are you SMOKING.
If I opened this venue: Who would I want to inaugurate it and demonstrate the full potential? It's a no brainer.   Keep in mind there is risk of failure and huge financial loss to the investors and COVID added significant unforeseen cost to this already risky venture.   This had to be years in the making/planning.  As far as Larry: I'd say He's done.   Whether his health issues are worse than reported or he's over being in U2.  His recent interview leads me to believe the latter for sure.
What are they thinking? Sadly, I don't think they've been thinking much for some time now. And I'm saying this as someone who became a fan after I spent a night listening to The Unforgettable Fire back in the 1980's.
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
I've been a fan since Achtung baby came out. I'd go see them in Vegas, Mullen or not.
Totally agree. As a huge fan by 20 years, I just get less and less interested by tjer new music since Songs of experiencie, and the very dissapointing Joshua Tree anniversary tour. But make shows whotout one of them it's a complete new level of absurd ambition, and with a smell of betrayal. After all of this they could just wait for him. Sad to see make covers of the younger versions of themselves, repeated tours and leave behind one of them. Such a decadence. Luckylly, nothing changes my love for their music from 1980 to 2009
I used to say that there were only three bands who've been together for 40 years or more without ever changing members from the first album.  ZZ Top, whose debut came out in 1971 had the same tres hombres until Dusty Hill's passing in 2021.  King's X same three guys since 1980 (with two different additional rhythm guitarists as The Edge between 1980-83) put out their first album together as Sneak Preview in 1984; debut King's X album in 1988; same three guys put out their most recent album last year!  U2, same four guys since 1976 (with two additional second guitarists including The Edge's brother in the first two years), with a touring keyboardist for the past 20 years and now a fill-in drummer?  I am unaware of ZZ Top or King's X ever being augmented or having fill-ins and/or additional touring musicians.  I know that lots of bands have (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, Cheap Trick, Deep Purple, The Eagles, Journey, Judas Priest, Kansas, KISS, Led Zeppelin [post-Bonham], Ozzy, Pink Floyd, Queen, Queensryche, Styx, Toto, UFO, Van Halen, The Who, Yes, et al) but these three bands are legendary for the consistency of the founding members.  I will add Rush with the honorable mention of John Rutsey on drums before and up to their debut, but Neil Peart did the tour for that album and it was the same trio until his death.  I saw ZZ Top about 25 years ago and while it was cool to see them again in 2022, it really wasn't quite the same without Dusty Hill.  I have only seen U2 three times (War, UF and JT) but I feel like those four are irreplaceable - like The Beatles, The Doors and Led Zeppelin.  Granted, when someone dies, the options are either to call it a day or augmenting in one way or another, but I don't think that I would be interested in going to see them with this arrangement.
It might have been different if they knew you had a Buddy Rich!
I totally agree with you Rick. If U2 come to the UK without Larry (or any member) I will not buy a ticket. Perhaps I’m a purist, or simply just loyal to U2. Either way, I agree.
Should I care? Ignore the dinosaurs.
You mean it’s not only about the the God-given, American right of millionaires to become billionaires?
Same goes for The Rolling Stones. You’d think Charlie Watts dying would cause the band to hang it up, especially seeing as how they’re fuckin 80 years old. But no. They just replaced him too!
I thought rick was going to complain about U2 doing a residency in las Vegas. Seems it's quite normal now.
Back in the days, bands had the BALLS to retire... Now it's just called milking the cow.
Seriously....? Any good drummer can do the job. The only question U2 fans should ask themselves is do you wanna see U2 or not.
Have you heard about the 2023 RUSH tour? No. Why? Because the band no longer exists without Neil Peart. U2 sold out decades ago. This coming from someone who listened to The Joshua Tree more than anyone alive today.
When Adam Clayton got dumped by whatsherface he was so upset he couldn’t play. The bass tech stood in and got a $100 for it.
health problems or they don't see eye_to_eye on stuff anymore.....differing life views?  this is hinted at in a Larry interview
I have been a U2 fan since Under A Blood Red Sky. I have seen them live many times...Vegas really?  Rick, does your friend Rich's last name begin with a N?
One of my first big concerts was U2 on the Joshua Tree tour.  That was a great show.
Achtung baby without larry? In a live concert…..really…
"We need to get out and see those faces" - BULLSHIT!! They need the money because they spent all their money of commercials, swag, photo shoots, publicity tours, expensive stages, and promotions through free downloads, etc. and lived above and beyond their means and now need to make all that money back. I loved U2 when I was a kid and I still am. They were a HUGE influence on me musically but even I wouldn't go out on tour after forty years and aging fans. These guys are in need of a serious retirement or at least consideration of it. Just like The Rolling Stones - they too need to retire A LONG TIME AGO!!! Some people just need to give up when the getting is over with. This is not a good thing! I won't go see them unless Larry was with them. I've never got to see them live but I don't think I want to now that their glory days are over with.
It’s not U2 without Larry Mullen Jr.  He is my favorite member of the band.
I applaud U2 for doing something different artistically.  A series in Las Vegas will be just that.  Touring may not have the same appeal at their age as it once did and they can be at the same place for a while and people come to them.  They have earned that ability and good for them.  I also applaud their artistic decision to present an album to their listener live in this day of sound bites, memes and just “playing the hits.”  The diehard fans who want to hear their favorite songs just need to get over it and trust the artists who are evolving humans wanting to explore something different.  They have the money to let people know about it through a Super Bowl ad, then again, good for them with another smart decision.  As for Larry Mullen not playing, it is not a deal breaker and an admission that U2 is bigger than just one person and plenty of bands have made great additions to their body of work down one member.  U2 knows that their time is limited and they want to keep playing and presenting their art to the listener and I’m glad they are choosing to do it in a new way for a period.
Apparently, the lads have not seen Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic...
Love U2, specially the magical period between War & Achtung, saw them live 1st time in the amazing AB tour, will always be a special part of my musical life. Even through their ups and downs, it was always the same team, now it seems that no more and plowing through just for the sake of trying to remain relevant (& making big bucks in the process) is so just anti U2, at least the one I fell in love with. Look at Rush, when NP passed, they had the integrity to call it a day, and more power to them. Bono & Edge need to look into their hearts and stop, for the sake of their legacy. And don't get me started on the awful decision to record new versions of their classics!
Larry out and me too. Good bye U2
I can see the point.  I hope Larry recovers from whatever ailments are keeping him away, and that he can rejoin his cohorts.  But people will still show up to see the band minus one. If they can play the songs as people know them, people will come back and come back for more.  But everone draws their line in the sand as to how much they'll accept.  If you take Bono or the Edge out of U2, they won't come because the essence would be too depleted.  But I get it; after seeing the Beatles in 1966, I've never made an attempt to see Paul without the other Beatles, even if his backing band has the chops to replicate their parts. It would feel sad....
I wonder if Larry has actually left the band and they just haven't announced it.
U2 have lost the plot. I don't understand why they need the money they are virtually one of the most successful bands of all time. Doing a tour without Larry is their final mistake. I won't see them without Larry.
I think the point of the SB ad was to reinject U2 into the public conversation.  They've been gone for a while.  And there's an entire generation of music fans who have no idea who the drummer is/was.   The Who without Keith, the Stones without Charlie...  it can certainly be done.  The fact is, believe it or not, the drummer can be replaced.  Hell, often the bassist can be replaced.   Yes, it's not the Beatles without Ringo, but there aren't many Beatles.  And I'd still buy a ticket to see the other three without him (no longer possible.)  So if Larry dies (God forbid) U2 should just retire from playing live music?  SMH.
The thing is I'm a venezuelan and I just got out of my country after 39 years because the dictatorship BS. Anyway, they never had a show in my country and I'm waiting the new U2's shows to go and watch them live. And just at this right time Larry will not be at the tour.. OMG 😱🤦🏻
Life doesn't stop because a drummer has surgery. This doesn't bother me. But I'm not a U2 fan.
I read somewhere that it was actually the manager that they just fired who was responsible for negotiating a terrible contract that got them into this mess - that's why they fired both the manager and Live Nation this past Fall.  But I'm not so sure about that - seems a given that if any band member is incapacitated, it would be enough to delay their involvement.  Perhaps the payout of being the opening act for the venue is too huge to miss out on, and forgoing the opportunity would have been a significant loss. My guess is Larry will get his full share even without playing.
Lifelong fan here.  So many thoughts.  First, perhaps LMJr is ok with this.  Maybe this project is not his jam.  He apparently hated the Passengers project.  If that is the case, that Larry is ok with this, what are everyone’s thoughts?   These shows are going to be so obscenely over priced and you are not even getting the original line up.  It’s a sin that they are finally choosing to perform their arguable greatest album without the original line up.  My opinion is they have always been desperate to stay relevant. Other bands like REM aren’t willing to give up their band identity to modernize. The whole thing is unfortunate.  I think they are tainting their legacy.
ACTUAL CORRECT ANSWER IS HERE:  It’s so simple: Larry Mullen has been having to have two hours physio before and after every gig. Imagine that every few nights for 2 years, at his age.  They’re playing a few residential shows for no doubt tens of millions of dollars. I don’t understand the issue everyone has, AT ALL. Even the iPhone Apple Music story is BS, it didn’t magically download, you had to actually click ‘DOWNLOAD’ to make it available on your phone. Apple paid them $100M for that. How many albums would you have to sell to get that sort of money?  Every point you’re making, you’re totally coming from the wrong direction IN EVERY SINGLE WAY. The fact Larry isn’t with them is the whole reason why they’re doing a short residency as opposed to a global tour. Also, it’s quite widely accepted that Achtung is their ‘other’ masterpiece. When Bono said at The NYE gig in Dublin saying they had to “go away and dream it all up again” to quote Bono.  So they went to Berlin, struggled, almost split up, created One, almost by accident, and things grew rapidly from there. If you’re going to make a ‘U2 WTF’ video, at least get the basics right? No offence. You’re just wrong with every reason you’re querying it.
I hope all the haters that don't like what they band are doing with this residency stay the hell home, so I can have a better chance to get tickets.
well bono will always need his tax free ivory back scratcher. they were done after actung baby as far as i`m concerned.
It's fine. Let them play
This Residence Gig is not about the fans.  It's all about dollars and cent$.  If U2 were being truthful, then honesty would be a world tour.
A globalist Bono U2 becoming a Vegas  caricatural
tempest in a teapot...🙄
Sadly, it's about money. Maybe, they miss the fans (then why not a traveling tour?) Sounds like they over extended themselves and schedules did not align for Larry to be there
You are SPOT! on.
I think Larrys back problems may be more serious and that he might be unofficially retired from U2....or that recovery will take years not months. Something doesnt feel right about it, we dont have all the info.
Oh, stop crying. It’s just temporarily. Other huge bands did the same. Bram is a great drummer and it’s going to be fine. Cry about the upcoming SOS album, that’s a fucking shame
I feel you in this one Rick Beato. I’m an old school fan as well.  Money grab. I’m surprised Larry’s ok with it and I wonder whether he may eventually overcome whatever is ailing him and play these shows.  I mean , these guys are ultra rich.  Maybe Larry bring out of commission is a marketing ploy that we’re falling for. Who know’s ? And to any new U2 fans out there- listen to the early albums when they were young and hungry .
Is Van Halen, Van Halen without Alex on the drums?  Is Metallica, Metallica without Lars?  Is Nirvana still Nirvana without Dave Grohl?  What are you thinking U2?  Maybe Phil Collins will do a Vegas residency without.....Phil Collins.
Completely agree with Rick
Big U2 fan for a long time but never been to a concert. A few weeks back my wife asked me if I could see any band live who I would like to see. I said U2 or Metallica. Turns out Metallica is touring this year and will be in Arlington, Texas which is not a bad drive from where I live. I then see the Super Bowl ad and get excited. After reading more about the lack of Larry Mullen, JR I just told my wife “If you are surprising me with tickets I want to see Metallica”.
I agree with you Rick
All things must pass..
I disagree..life is short. Do it while u still can. Tomorrow is not promised.
Rick B... Please Do A Profile On Stevie Wonder...   PLEASE!!!  We Would Greatly Appreciate It... Try To Do A Full Interview And Equipment Profile And Thangs .... That Would Be Insane Man....!!!   Love Your Channel..
You sound like a 15 year old worrying about your favorite band Rick. Good! That's the fun of it.
U2 suck!  BonER is a globalist George Soros Muppet sellout anti Irish bastard. . Never too late to see the error of your ways my friend. FROM A  Dubliner.
Gloria black &white video..hum...1979 ish  Wow time flies   Do they have your permission??
Some guy talking about a guy who can't anymore....really rubs it in like calling him lazy or something.... Hope he don't piss in the cherros for everyone....
True fans would prefer they use the time to write great songs again (vs. the recent garb) while Larry heals.
Have you changed your mind on this?
"It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success" The Fly - U2
after tthe unforgettable fire...  they have sucked
Band wants to  make some cash ? I am SHOCKED  ,shocked I tell you  !!
Journey comes to mind...
I refuse to see anything that is not the original lineup.
Well, Queen aka the band that Freddie Mercury was in, is touring with Adam Lambert for 12 years now. Not one new song in that time, only the old hits every year. So, yeah, when enough is enough?
Really ?! U2 fan since "0CTOBER" up to "Joshua Tree".
Thx for telling the naked truth, Rick !!!
Spot on!! nuts that they'd play without him!!
Im not a fan of the band at all so it doesn’t matter who is in the band. I am a fan of the Edge though.
That’s like going on vacation with you kids and leaving you wife behind because she broke her foot or something like that. You either bring her or don’t go on vacation.
Lifelong hard-core U2 fan....and I agree. This is a bad idea.
Remind me not to join the cash cows In Vegas, no Larry, NO U2.
Poor guys.... need to make a little extra to help their poor friends !
U2 isn't becoming Kansas are they?  Let's hope they replace their management before that form of slow death occurs.
Bono turned out to be a see you in tea
It seems to me like there have been a lot of signs that U2 is ready to pack it up and this Vegas residency seems like just another nail in the coffin.  When I listened to "The Little Things That Give You Away" from "Songs of Experience" I thought "This is the beginning of the end".  I heard...  Sometimes The end isn't coming It's not coming The end is here Sometimes  ...and I thought "that sounds so strange" but then it dawned on me.  I think "The end isn't coming" is alluding to the creative process.  The song writing process.  Like it's getting tougher and tougher to make new songs and "The end is here" is alluding to the end of their journey as a band.  They're just out of gas.  Then they name their latest work "Songs of Surrender" and it's just a collection of existing songs re-imagined.  Now the Vegas residency.  This is a farewell thing in my opinion.  I'll probably never see this band live again.  All good things must come to an end.
No Larry,  no party...
Bono is one money grubbing bar steward for someone who is supposed to be a humanitarian.
Rick do you like the British band EMF? If you're a fan of Achtung Baby you should check them out, since they were using a lot of the same kind of sounds (especially similar to songs like the Fly) a year or two before Achtung Baby came out. Worth a listen!
Saw them play a full gig at a stadium in Sydney Australia without Adam Clayton - i believe he was still recovering from a big nite out and wasn't feeling the love. The Bass/guitar tech took his place, not what we were hoping for i can tell you. It was the Zoo Tv tour. Still love their music and have seen them 7 or 8 times
I was glad they put that album on for free!
Now don't get me wrong here, I think the world of some of the musicians involved-like Vince Gill-but the Eagles are nothing more than a Don Henley money grubbing cover band. I hope U2 is going that route.
After reading several very hysterical comments I will give my opinion: U2 has maintained its formation since 1976, I think it should be the maximum case of longevity for a band. They only acted without a member on 2 occasions, Adam Clayton on the ZooTv tour and Bono when he had an accident (U2+1). U2 must have a contract to fulfill and Larry has a health problem... what is the problem that the group acts with the consent of Mullen???? Of course, if it were not so, it would be very bad, but there is no indication that this is the case. Furthermore, his absence is not definitive. And if it were, I want Larry to keep collaborating on future projects. We fans know that he is the origin of U2. Greetings from a U2 fan from Argentina.
I agree Rick. Grow old gracefully. Do a tour every five years and become proficient at gardening.
Dear U2, why do you still exist?
Huge nothing burger.
I'm with you, Rick. I like Rattle and Hum. I let The Joshua Tree slip by. R&H is where I caught on (I was 15). Achtung Baby was huge!
We want to connect with our fans, so let's play a bunch of gigs........in only 1 city!!   Oh, and let's make it tbe most commercial, decadent place on earth!! Even though only about 10% of our fans can attend.
Take a shot ever time Rick says YouTube instead of U2
I'm 40 years old, got into this band when I was 10, in high school I did a deep dive into U2 and have been a die hard fan ever since. I can't get behind this residency and going at it without Larry behind the kit.
They lost their entire dignity.
I'm not sure using The Police or The Beatles is a good comparison here — in both those cases they were really not getting along at the end. Maybe think about The Who or The Stones. Who could imagine them without Keith Moon and Charlie Watts? And yet they continued. Of course, you might argue those are exactly the bands to prove your point! :P Also... we don't really know Larry's condition and prognosis. In any case, all the best to Larry!
Charlie Watts was in the Stones for 58 years and they just replaced him and kept going.
That's abandoning 25% of your family U2.
No one wants to see Mullen go out like Phil Collins did, unable to play, and that's where he's at right now. Mullen himself said his elbow and knee injuries will force him to take some time to heal and won't tour in 2023 because he needs another surgery. He's 61, has already had surgery on his knee and back throughout the years and has tendonitis, give the guy and the band a break. Sadly, most fans won't miss him much even though he's an integral part of the band to us musicians.
Pretty sure this was planned before Larry wasn't able to be part of.  Hopefully if so many people are upset, that will leave a greater chance of me scoring some tickets!  💃🏻🤞🏻
Totally agree...
U2 have become so bad, they really should have hung it up when the IRA did.  Since then they have just become insistent on themselves.  The music world would be the same....with or without them.  Also, Las Vegas residency is code for "last chance cash grab", so who cares who's playing the drums.  Legend has it that once upon a time Bono wrote a letter to Captain Beefheart asking if he'd like to work with him on some music.  Captain Beefheart wrote back: "Dear Bongo, no."  I hope that's a true story.
Money. Money. Money
Without this drummer, it is not U2.  U2 has tons of money. They can find other projects and call it something else (not U2) and wait for their drummer to return.
Actung Baby's stage show was wickedly expensive to put on, I suspect you will be able to see the original props in this show as they recoup the investment.
Regret never seeing them, but can’t imagine traveling expense and show expense to see this show? Their whole catalog is so deep with HITS! Great band , great music. LM Jr. (…the rhythm section of that band) is the heart and soul.
Yeah, well, an eternal debate, right? I mean, what is ZZ Top nowadays? A parody, right. Or the Stones? Give me a break, why didn´t they stop when Charlie died? I understand that small bands like Dr Feelgood keep going even without a single original member. There are bills to pay. But Bands like the Stones, ZZ Top or U2 probably don´t have any trouble paying their bills...and they literally cannibalize small groups with the rediculous amount of cash you can only spend once to see them. A sick business...
Larry is a home bird.  I've no idea why U2 are doing this without him, but I'm sure he's happy enough them going ahead with it.  It's not really U2 though, is it..
I wonder how the Edge or Bono would feel if the band went out without one of them? Total BS, wait for L.M. to get healthy.
Agreed, I think Rattle and Hum is excellent. I don't understand the controversy around it.
The guy who is filling in is from here. I actually opened up for him back in 1999. Yes…I’m old… And spot on regarding the intrusive mandatory U2 album…. Had to delete it five times !!
"How many yachts can you water-ski behind, Gordon? How much is enough?"
one thing to bear in mind is that drummer's bodies are the first to go, especially drummer playing with a tom heavy style like Fleetwood (who uses a lot of "help" to get thru shows and has for years) and Mullen Jr. these are not young men anymore and even bono isn't the little ball of speed he was when he was a kid. in short, there's a chauvinism among other musicians about drummer and generally it seems like the only people who appreciater it are the guitarists of us that are also trained dummers as well. If there's a member of a band thart requires a bit of coddling, it's your stick person.
Yeah, Rick's nailed it. Done is done and everything else is nostalgia. I've seen U2 three times encompassing their classic period. 1984, 1989, 1993. All in Christchurch, NZ. The 84 show was the first time they ever played Pride, indoor, Town Hall. 1989 was 60,000 strong at Lancaster Park, the Love Town Tour which was the Rattle and Hum Tour by a different name with BB King opening, and it was monumental. I still get chills. Right time, right place, right age, right girl, right everything. 1993 was the Zoo TV Tour with the swinging Trabants. Horrible sound. Even on the official concert release video, the show in Sydney, AU, a couple of days before I saw them, the sound is kinda thick and muddy. But Zooropa is a great album so all is excused.  And Bono is now so woke. But damn, I love the Rattle and Hum movie as it captures so much about that time period.  Only the Stones can mess will lineups and get away with it, though dropping Brown Sugar smells awfully bad.
There must be some internal frustration with Mullen or the other 3 members wouldn't have gone along with this. Maybe he just doesn't have it in him anymore? Or it may be that his days are numbered and the band wants us to get used to U2 without him? But if that's the case (that Mullen has a terminal illness or he's just checked out), yes, the gentlemanly thing to do is just close up shop, do a farewell tour and call it a day... not replace him. The remaining 3 can tour as something else, but they are not U2.
I refused to see Kiss without Peter. Will never see the Stones now without Charlie. And would not see U2 without Larry. They were the heartbeat of these bands. Are you going to see Van Halen without Eddie? Of course not. This is the same thing. Just money grabbing.
What about when the Pixies replaced Kim Deal?
Achtung baby is literally my favorite album ever of all the times but all this bullsh*t that there's no Larry and also just doing this just in the USA is the most ridiculous thing ever (i don't Even care about the technology of the stadium just give me a classic zoo tv and that's it) Bono is literally every single year more an "American" rather that Irish :/
What do think about the Stones, Pearl Jam? I tend to agree with you.
Templemore secondary school
Larry Mullen Jr. has ruled himself out from touring for all of 2023.  Under normal circumstances, I think there's little question that the band would take the year off for Larry.  Unfortunately, if they want to continue playing at the level they are accustomed to for some years to come, the circumstances pretty much dictate that they need to get playing asap.  It's an understatement to say that U2 shows are epic productions.  Beyond that aspect, their sets are generally over two hours long.  They are in their 60's and they haven't played a show in over three years.  Given the incredible live performance level that the band has maintained for 40+ years, fans nor the band members themselves (especially) would be satisfied with a decline in quality.  It's no different than being an athlete.  The older one gets, the more work is required to maintain "game fitness".  Practicing in the studio or the jam space is just not the same thing.  I agree, the ad is a bit of an odd move, but I completely understand why the band is choosing to push on without Larry at this point.  They have to.
I was so excited about going to see U2 for this Las Vegas Residency. I'm sorry but It's Not U2 if Larry isn't going to be performing. Would they make the same decision if Bono or The Edge were not able to make this event? I'm really disappointed with the band members making this kind of money grab, what else can you call it? You can't have my money this time U2!
never cared for u2
Have boy and Unforgettable fire, love those albums , got them in our wee local record shop when they came out , I pop them on the autochanger pretty often. What a great band, of their time one of the best
This is what is next to Laughing gas !
If the Stones can just replace Charlie Watts
I don't agree.  If they are all comfortable with it and Larry is good,  then let there be Rawk!
The drummer no one wanted looks like the Luke Skywalker no one wanted.
I totally agree. I've been a fan since 1981. When I first heard the single "Gloria". Larry has always played a big part of their sound. In interviews I've seen Bono and Edge stating that it really is Larry Mullen's band. And now they are going on a Las Vegas gig without their band leader? It's surreal and it's stupid.
Boy and War is the U2 I started with.  Everything after Achtung Baby was when I lost interest.  Las Vegas represents a money grab to me.  These guys are very rich by any standard.  Why?
Temple Mount ????   .... Mount Temple actually.
U2's ZooTV tour is still the greatest tour of any band/musical artist in history.
Larry's embarassed by U2 now - dont blame him
U2 is a nostalgia act?
Talk about DeadCo. The slow folks led by Mayer, , Oteil, and Chimenti.
Rick, on your next video why don't you study the outro on You've Got A Friend by Anita Kerr, that last drop by the drums is just fabulous! Just to hold the idea in line next time you study the end of a song and outros.
It's 100% about the building.  It cost $ 2 billion.  The list of entertainers that could open that venue is short: Rolling Stones or U2.  I can't think of another.
Agreed, even if I was in Vegas and could afford tickets, I would not go. Been a fan since 1982. Come on, U2! Wait it out until Larry can play.
Q: What’s the difference between God and Bono?  A: God doesn’t walk around Dublin acting like he’s Bono
“We’re Only In It For The Money”…sarcastic  comment by Frank Zappa… now embraced whole heartedly by U2. I saw them during the War tour in 1983. Best concert that I ever saw…saw them for UF, Joshua Tree, AB…including the concert Rick mentioned. They sold their souls a long time ago. Hopefully they’ll get them back someday.
I think that U2 should have disbanded after POP. Or continued into the same path of avant-gardizing themselves that started with Achtung Baby. But they chose to go back to their old safe commercial sound and make forgettable albums --"Songs of Experience" has some interesting stuff but as "Collector's box" stuff, not as a proper album. And now replacing their iconic drummer just for the money? The rest of the band (mainly Bono) should have their egos surgically removed because they aren't able to see when it is time to say NO to cash.
Please react to NFs new song HOPE!! I wanna see what you think about this!!
We were out in Vegas in August 2022 and I asked our Lyft driver what that big sphere thing was when we drove past it. They were still finishing it up at that point, but he said it was a new entertainment arena. He also said that U2 was slated to be the first act with a residency in it when it opens in 2023, so they had to have that deal inked for a while even at that point. I'm guessing they were working on it way before Larry had to go into back surgery.
yep i am living in Dublin for the last 44 years and you are absolutely right U2 with out Larry Mullen Jr non merci .
They should call the residency 'With or Without You, Larry Mullen Jr'.
I'm betting they pulled an unknown from a U2 tribute band.  I couldn't do it.  My band of 24 years is now performing our last few shows as our drummer (of 17 years) has to step down for medical reasons.  And I just can't bring myself to replace him...not now.  Maybe it's a grieving process I have to go through first, but the idea of weeding through the wackos on Craigslist and doing auditions just turns my stomach.  U2 don't need the money, but I can understand the need to perform.  But geez...when you've had a line-up that hasn't changed in the life of the band, that should be respected.
They want to open the greatest music venue of all time!!! And the venue wants to have a monster band opening it!!! Larry is injured. It's that simple! 😮‍💨
What I find interesting is not just replacing Larry for LV (which I guess they had to do to be the first act in the giant globe - U2 can’t wait for Larry and be the 4th or 5th act!) but that this is their 3rd rehash the hits project since 2017. They have this new Achtung Baby in LV, they are coming out with a 4(!) CD  set of new versions of their old songs and in 2018 did a stadium tour playing the entire Joshua Tree.  I appreciate their business sense and am not against having a good time listening to these great songs if you have the money, but this is U2 on the downward slope of the creative arc.
Whatever. The band knows what they’re doing and we don’t know all the facts.  Much ado about nothing.
Comments from Henry Rollins would be interesting
All due respect to Larry but this was not as bad as the SOI apple stunt, or as their brand new album taylor swifting their impeccable old songs… I’m a huge fan, but they do need someone to tell them when they are being less than brilliant
And they are using Ticketmaster 😢
I am a U2 fan ever since the late 1980s. I am one of the few die-hard defenders of U2 in my circle of friends and peers, where apparently nobody likes them. But: I absolutely agree with the Apple thing being a crappy idea; and now the Vegas gig? You didn't mention it Rick, but what is even worse than doing it without Larry Mullen Jr. is that they are doing it in Vegas, as a commercial residency, of all things and all places. Bono of all people should be someone aware about the absurdity, yes perversion Las Vegas is, what it does to the entire environment around it, what it can do to people. Yes, there can be a morbid fascination about that, but joining the rollercoaster ride to doom? And for what? Yes, they might not have made any money since 2019 with playing live, but come on - they are not poor fellas who need some cash for retirement so they still gotta work a little bit.
Bono is the crap
Absolutely on the button man!
Surely a Las Vegas audience will demand all their greatest hits not just stuff from Achtung Baby ?!?
Rick says:  "YES - some bands replace people, and go on" (06:20)  An unintended, yet very apt statement.  YES.  Today, the line-up of YES consists of:  - Jay Schellen - Billy Sherwood - Geoff Downes - Jon Davison - Steve Howe  If U2 can be criticized for performing without ONE original band member, how shall we consider YES?  It's a NO from me.  Really? Really. .
This band moves in mysterious ways.
What is the big deal?   From what I understand Mullens has a bad back and can't play.   People get old.   Some guys health give out.   Tiger can't play anymore it is still golf.   Brady retired, there will still be football.   It isn't disrespectful if Mullen can't play and they move on.   It is this thing called life.   What should U2 never play again?   Silly.   Not the same sure.   But not any good?  Preposterous.
The lads are all in their 60s now. Some of them are going to miss shows for health reasons. I can understand Larry's reasons for not wanting to live in Vegas for a stretch.  They subbed some other fella in for Adam on the Zoo tour back in the day and nobody noticed.
What about the stones and Charlie???
You did not mention if Larry Mullen Jr. plans to return after health issues are addressed, but if he is done performing, retiring the U2 name would be the class move. When Neil Peart passed on, every Rush fan knew that there would never be another concert by "Rush" without him. Geddy and Alex may play again with another drummer as they did for the Taylor Hawkins memorial, but the name they used with Neil is retired.
U2 did a concert in Brisbane Australia in about 92 with a stand in bassist when Adam Clayton was too drunk to play. Was at the concert
I was the same about that U2 / Apple thing.. Even though I had been a U2 fan since 1982 - I was LIVID at their arrogance, taking away MY CHOICE to buy or not to buy it. I was like, who the f*ck do they think they are, the sheer intrusion to go into my record collection when I wasn’t looking and put their new album in there !
Ask Larry what he thinks, could even be his idea. Maybe this was the less worst option?
The one that *really* winds me up, and for the same reasons you've expressed Rick, is Queen.  Queen, for 20 years, was Fred, Brian, Rog and John.   Queen+ means _those four guys_ ... plus someone else (e.g. Bowie, Jackson).  For Brian and Rog to bill themselves as 'Queen' is as illogical as Macca and Ringo billing themselves as 'The Beatles'.  But, sadly, not all fans are created equal.   The vast majority lack depth of discernment, and see a U2 or Queen gig as simply an excuse to boogie in the same room as some rich celebrities on a stage. They're motivated by the same desire for vicarious greatness as those who seek to be photographed with, say, the Dalai Lama.  Kinda nauseating actually.
It’s a crazy decision. Last of a serie of stupid decisions ruining the image of the band. Somewhere in the band there’s a lack of reality awareness. They risk becoming pathetic.  And this is from a long time U2 fan.
I'll tell U2 the truth to their face: Hey guys, congratulations on all the success, and I hope you have happy, fulfilling, wonderful lives. I mean that sincerely. Also, you're the 3rd-most overrated band in the history of everything ever.
Achtung Baby concert was one of the best. The album was a departure from their sound. Electronic, hip hop beats, middle eastern theme, on and on... game changer for U2
Couldn’t be as awful as the Songs of Surrender stuff…what are they thinking indeed
Haha, Rick, you say "YouTube" throughout the video instead of "U2".
I was born in 1981 and Achtung Baby is my favorite U2 album.
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
I am a fan of U2 but I would not buy a ticket to this residency.. You guys were making music together for 4 decades..  You played many , many live shows together , and each member was an integral part of the band and the songs..  You have made your millions , toured many times , and made a great legacy.  But , going back on tour with a fill in drummer just reeks of greed ..   It should only be the original members of the band , and nothing else.
Rick did you even consider the possibility that they had already planned all of this before Larry Mullens health problems?
U2 have been irrelevant for decades…anything after zooropa is garbage
I've been a U2 fan since the early 80's, and to hear that they are replacing Larry with someone else just rubbed me the wrong way.  This sounds like a 12 show residency, which will be very expensive, and without Larry I don't care how much this new guy sounds you won't be able to replace the original sound.  40 plus years of being able to look at each other and know each other's ticks and movements.  This just won't be there.  I love U2, but maybe they should hold up the residency/tour until Larry is healed.  I'm also a huge Rush fan, and you will never be able to emulate the sound of Neil Peart.  Each drummer, guitarist, bassist, singer has there own sound.  You just cannot emulate this.  You can try, but in the end the originals are what you are there for.
Times change Rick. People get older. How many bands even just ten years old has the original band members. Oh well. Move on.
I really liked "War" when it came out but eventually I just couldn't stand Bono (as a person) and everything they did became "coloured" by that.... I know...I know.
No new manager of a huge band like U2 is taking 20%. Probably not even 10%. It's the unknown and small time bands that have to pay 15-20%. But I agree, Rick - this is a massive misstep to play without Larry.
«Band» or «brand», that is the question.
I've been a U2 fan since the 80s, but here's the thing about "new" fans:  If you're a fan, you usually go back and listen to the old albums too.  I mean, the Doors were before my time, but I own all their albums.  So yes, Achtung Baby should be fine, even for new fans.  It's arguably their best album besides Joshua Tree, so it makes sense.
boy....someone's kissing up for free tickets 😂🤣
I loved U2 but they have been falling off for a long time in my opinion.This Las Vegas thing without Larry is just sad.
I wish you'd do a segment on Stevie Ray Vaughan
In 1974, Stephan Stills was interviewed about the upcoming CSN&Y tour.  He said, "the first tour was for the music, the second for the Chicks and this one's for the money." At least he was honest.
I was there at Celtic Park for Zoo TV. What can I say, the best concert ever. It had everything. What a sound and delivery by Bono. I loved the Glam they added to the show. No Wonder he wore those Fly Glasses. Playing live is in their blood. Its where U2 songs take their own identity, often a complete transform from the Studio. As a fan, there are only a few studio songs I listen to, the rest are all Live. Gone are the days of Rack Spotting & LED lights flashing to guess what Edge is using from Bootleg CD's. I'm sure this will be one concert not to miss even with or without Larry, LOL!!!
The band's yachts aren't gonna pay for themselves.
I don’t know what the big deal is about seeing as Rolling Stones have continued after original members left or died . U2 are hypocrites and although I like them and seen them twice they’ve always been a money making machine managed more by accountants than music loving people
Nailed it Rick!
I've been reading Bono's book and, as you would suspect, it's a great read. He talks about Larry Mullen Jr and his initial hesitance with the use of drum machines and such on Achtung Baby and how it turned out great with Larry's work. He also gets into a hilarious story about the Apple download debacle. But to your point, the SB ads were weird and without Larry one could argue that fans are getting ripped off by 25%. It's one thing to have an emergency where the drum tech or another player performs to save the show. But this is different - they could rebook.
Good Rant Rick.  I'm in complete agreement.    I saw them the 1st time in 1981, but they lost me after Actung baby   I tried again with How to Dismantle a Nuclear bomb and found out it was How to Dismantle a great band.
The ultimatum given Larry was simply "with or without you"  ....I'll show myself out.
The Who slotted in Kenny Jones when Keith Moon passed, and that album and the 82-83 tour were amazing. If Larry Mullin has health issues and has given his blessing to this, I'm not seeing a problem.
They should learn some loyalty from Def Leppard.
While I agree that playing without Larry will be a letdown, I never got to see the Zoo TV tour, and reports are they're going to modernize that concert for these Vegas dates. If I can get tickets, I want to finally see it live. The Stones replaced players all throughout their careers. Queen still forges on without Freddie Mercury, even today. You're as much of a student of this stuff as I am. The Temptations and Four Tops are still playing. With how many original members? This is not unprecedented.
Very true Rick. AB is my favorite U2 record and I was always isolating the low end from Larry and Adam when listening to it. Astonishing work! But no way in hell is this “residency” about ANY of the honor and dignity this band always represented themselves as being all about. And certainly not about loyalty.
I'm a U2 fan AND I'm a drummer. Probably been playing as long as Larry. On every level it has always been okay to leave the drummer behind because the guitarist/singer ego prevents them from waiting. They don't think it will make that much of a difference. Aerosmith did it. Cheap Trick and scores of other bands continue after their long term drummer needs time off. I always thought that U2 was NOT one of those bands.   I guess I was wrong.
The average age of the people going to see U2 in Las Vegas is probably 50 to 55 (not counting the kids who get dragged there by their parents and grandparents).
Rick, I fear Larry is going out of the band for good due to the phisical problems. If you look closely in the video he appears with the other three so, somehow he's there.  This residency seems to be the swan song and farewell gig for the guys. And they wouldn't do it without Larry blessing them from outside.  As you are, I'm old enough to have attended the original ZooTV show (even then with Pearl Jam opening!) and it was magical. All in all I think it's a good way for ending the Mount Temple School adventure with a "bang". Yes and with Larry cheering and clapping from the front row and on stage for the final curtain call.
Money.  This is it.  When I was working in Vegas last year, the Uber driver was telling me all about the sphere that will be done next year and that U2 would open the sphere.  Without a doubt............the boys from Dublin were fronted a ton of coin, and the band will be there.  LMJ won't be able to make it, no problem, let's find some unknown drummer to fill the spot.  Don't read into the crappy PR release of 'back in front of fans'.  If they wanted to do that, there would be a full-blown tour with the top dollar seat of $25.  Pure greed, no different than a 'private' show that they are being w-e-l-l paid for.
To my humble opinion, Larry just pushed them, that's it...
yep, full stop.  These guys are legends and to go on without the founder even for a few shows is disrespectful.
Totally agree, nowadays almost every band doesn´t gives a sh%$ about their original members. And in this case what´s the point or the urgency to do it without Mr. Larry Mullen Jr . I truly believe the only honest band is Rush as always.
Hated that Apple thing. Hated it. :P    I love U2, however.
Jimmie Nicol version 2.0
true!
Так себе поступок от своих коллег друзей по группе.  Можно было и подождать
R.E.M. were never the same band without drummer Bill Berry - but the problem was the new albums.  They were still an awesome live band.  U2 can still sound awesome with someone else playing the drum parts that Larry Mullen Jr. wrote.  They're still his parts, but someone else can play them and no one will notice the difference.   The bigger question would be whether U2 should make new records without him, and this is different from R.E.M. too.  Bill Berry left when R.E.M. was at the height of its powers (even though I personally prefer the IRS years),  but U2 already stopped making great albums years ago.
I used to be a huge U2 fan all throughout the 80's and 90's. Then I hit a point of oversaturation, I guess, and burnout of hearing their music. Then I realized how much I dislike Bono's whiny, over desperate, angsty voice. Now, even 20-30 years later I can't stand U2 and really dislike their music and hearing Bono's voice is like fingernails on a chalk board.
This is a great decision for U2 and fans. Las Vegas is the perfect hub for fans to fly into and also provides a base for the artists to stay and not have to deal with all the expense for travel that makes it nearly impossible for making a profit while touring.
He’s injured…
This is a brand new venue that is opening and their residency is the key to it and it is likely that as part of their contract that they do promotion for it. This isn't rocket science Rick. Though doth protest too much.
They don't need the money, especially Bono, he has private equity ventures that bring in much more money. Maybe he does just need to be on stage 🤷‍♂️ An ad during the super bowl is quite the flex, which is a U2 thing. They've always gone larger than their contemporaries, and set a precedent for live music production everytime. So, I guess they flexed again! 😂
That is very wrong.  I saw U2 in 1993 Zooropa tour at RDS stadium in Dublin, both shows.  As great as drummer, not as a singer. He had the smaller drum set didn't go all out.  It was great, just like Bun E. Carlos of Cheap Trick.  Neil Peart was extremely different, but it fit in perfect with the Rush sound.  Their sound was 1 in 25.  Think Led Zep. Called it quits after Bonham, no true replacement.  Certain bands bring a 1 in 25 sound. Very detectable,  You can't change that.  Its taking the PB out of a Reeses PB cup and calling it Reeses Air Cup.  I say don't play without Larry !
great rant, from a U2 fan from the 'I will follow' days.... Haven't followed them much lately.
People also forget that Adam didn't play a gig on an Australian tour. He was arrested for possession of pot (I think). The bass tech filled in on at least one show.
Put simply, money money, ego and more money $$$.
My take away from this well founded (and stated) rant: Going to see U2 without Larry Mullen Jr. would be like going to the Rocky Horror Show on stage at the Roxy and finding out that Tim Curry was not going to perform... yeah that happened: Or, going to see the Stones with a replacement for Mick Jagger. At least U2 has the decency to announce that LMJ will not be on stage playing.  Oh, of course it's for the money.
I'm offended, as a drummer, that this would be considered at all. But also, as a drummer, I know there are only a few of us who will notice. Nobody cares who's behind the kit.
I agree with the rant, and I feel they should have waited until Larry had recovered from his back surgery. My guess is they had it booked and can't back out. Why not wait another 6-12 months?
I was all in to see them in Vegas. Until I found out no Larry, now I see no point in going to the show.
got to agree with you on this one
U2 have ten million reasons to put on the show at the Las Vegas Sphere.  I am sure Larry will be getting two and a half million reasons not to give a toss that a session guy is standing in for him! The Sphere is now costing over $2Billion to build and they have a deadline of opening Fall 2023. U2 committed to this so they will have to play despite Larry Mullen Jnr not being there. It's a case of With or Without You for sure!
Especially for the concert tours that followed the 1991 release of Achtung Baby (but even going back as far as War and the 1983 Red Rocks concert), U2 has always employed cutting edge technology to enhance its live performances. If I were the powers-that-be, instead of bringing on Bram van den Berg, I would figure out some way to have a virtual version of 1991 Larry Mullen, Jr. playing along with Bono, the Edge, and Adam Clayton during their residency at The Sphere. And then also figure out some way to replicate the 1991 versions of Bono, the Edge, and Adam Clayton. Frankly, they're all getting way too old and decrepit for this. Grace Slick had it right when she said, "“All rock-and-rollers over the age of 50 look stupid and should retire.“
Get a grip man. First of all, the Police reunion tour was more than a “few shows”. They went AROUND the world, I saw them twice, fantastic. And bands do this all the time. The Who, Stones, GnR, Pearl Jam… Mullen is great, but if there’s an “easier” member to replace in a band than the rest of the members, the order probably starts with drummer. Sad but true 🤷
Dear Rick, I couldn't agree more. This is so stupid it makes me think that Ian McCulloch from Echo & The Bunnymen was always right. Bono is a knobhead (Ian calls him Nobo instead of Bono).
"We'll make tons of money."  Says it all.
RB is correct. Recall this same situation was dissected around their second album, October, when Adam Clayton wanted to quit. It is only these four with the U2 chemistry. R.E.M. made this same mistake when losing drummer Bill Berry. They lost the full R.E.M. chemistry but embarrassed themselves for another 15 years, limping along without their full chemistry.
Rick, I completely agree with you. If anything, I think you are softening your language bit too much. Bono is worth seven hundred million dollars. He could have waited another year for Larry.
What happened with the guitar while you were recording, Rick?
Having never had the opportunity and money meet at a time U2 was touring, this might be my last shot.  It really bums me out about Larry, but if it all boils down to poor timing and contracts, I get it.
I met Bono and Edge when they gigged at Belfield bar at University College Dublin in 1980. I've been a fan ever since. As such, I wouldn't waste my time or money on this obvious cash grab.
Never liked them...honestly...who cares!...WITH ALL DUE RESPECT OF COURSE!
My first concert was the Zoo TV tour, it was mind blowing and at that stage I was already a massive U2 fan, starting with War. They had Primus open for them. I agree it is strange and simply put, without Larry Mullen Jr. it isn't U2. If the band feels the need to get out and celebrate an album like Achtung Baby, it has to be with all 4 of them otherwise it isn't possible, the moment has passed. Fans can go listen to the record but I can't see what there is to offer live without all 4 of them.
Rick....it's the drummer
My parents took me to my first concert when I was in 4th grade. It was the Auctunq baby tour in Hershey,PA
My only thought would be is that they signed a contract with the Vegas venue before they knew Larry was going to need surgery - and he couldn't play - hopefully they continue the Achtung Baby shows into 2024 when Larry is ready to come back
So correct. Its a question all bands need to ask themselves when they've been around so long. When is enough enough?  U2 without Larry is like the Simpsons without one of the family.  You just can't.
management milking the brand. Unforgettable Fire btw is their best album. That's when they became world class.
FKU2
Screw u2.  I'm 58 years old and they've always sucked.
Man, I love Actung Baby, one of my faves. Rattle and Hum is epic. Sounds like their manager is grubbin'.
I can't believe the news today...
The Stones used to include Brian Jones, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts (58 YEARS WITH THE BAND!).  They (bands) love to sweet talk the media and fans about the irreplaceablity of someone.  But when push comes to shove, the band must go on (and the $$$$$ has to keep coming in and touring contracts need to be honoured). Their live sound will change of course but that's inevitable with any change.  People shouldn't go and see them if they're really upset bc income is the only thing that will make them take notice.
what surprised me most in this video is that there still are U2 fans nowadays  the funniest hing in the video was Bono saying they are missing "the fans"
The Joshua Tree album came out, at perhaps, the most pivotal moment in my life, after the death of my first husband. And it was almost, uncannily, autobiographical. I can't begin to tell you of how much that album meant to me. And I found myself traveling alone throughout the SW, at that time, blasting the album on my car stereo, & living every note as they rose into the vivid, intensely-blue, Southwestern sky. But as big of a fan as I was of U2, I'm not sure that I had ever seen them in concert. (Maybe at a local church, when they first started-out?) But that was to finally change when U2 announced their Joshua Tree 30th Anniversary Tour, & my husband & I had tickets to see them in St. Louis, on September 16, 2017. But due to the acquittal of Officer Jason Stockley, in the shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, & the subsequent peaceful protests that turned violent; it became the only date in which U2 cancelled their concert. We went to St. Louis, anyway, & walked around the Arch, & downtown. I remember conversing with some homeless people in a park. And overall, it was actually quite quiet, that evening, & we didn't have any problems. But here we are, still not having seen U2. And especially not having heard them perform The Joshua Tree. Maybe some day...
The band that has a politician as their singer had become increasingly less interesting after issuing Rattle and Hum (and I think that is the point when the singer became the politician), so no surprise here: it's been a downward spiral since 1988 when my idols were no longer my heroes who performed that fantastic gig that became the Under a Blood Red Sky album. So yes, Rick, I am one of those people 4:54 😋
Staying on the subject of Irish Musicians, is there any chance you could delve into some Gary Moore specifically, The Messiah Will Come Again | LIVE Montreux Jazz Festival 1990. I would love to see you take that song apart. Gary was a master musician and EXTREMLEY underated as a guitar player, why, I have no idea!
They only rage for the machine, are now a political establishment band against the individual. Neil Peary would be horrified.
Not showing much respect Rick, let alone you don't even care to mention the replacement drummer, but also who the bleep are you all together to bash a band over this? Al Capone? Their drummer is sick, so they get a replacement. Get Over It.
I was 12 when I heard the Joshua Tree, and been a fan ever since only missing tours recently because of the ticket prices and also because 95 % of the audience watching the show through their phone (but that’s another story). Zoo TV remains as the definitive live masterpiece from a period of creative fertility for the band, only really matched in scope perhaps by the 360 tour and the emotional impact that brought. At the time of Achtung Baby’s release Larry made a throw-away tongue-in-cheek quip that went something like this : “I don’t care about the lyrics - I think it’s all about Drums!”.   The sphere cost a LOT of money, and it’s U2’s opening the doors and fulfilling a prestigious and lucrative premier as well as this lust for a pioneering kudos that has forced a hasty announcement. No doubt U2 had to make a hard decision, but for the first time they appear to have put the U2 machine in front of the music or any of the four members. This is not a move for the fans - it scans like a political statement, and the fans can see through it. Unfortunately the shows can only really be a commercial success, which they will be, but the real damage will be to the unique romantic notion of the 4 members of the band powerful, ‘in the sound’, an unshakable force that exists because of that famous and by now mythical ‘4 legged table’.   Put simply, a U2 show without Larry (or any of the four) is not a U2 show. It’s showBUSINESS alright, which might be in line with the kind of crass and cynical art they so successfully and artistically lampooned with ZooTV in the first place, but U2 never took U2 for granted before, at least not on this scale, and not at the expense of the identity of the band.  It’s disappointing. They shouldn’t have done it, and they should have waited for Larry, blessing or not.
I thought this the last time 'Fleetwood Crowded Mac House' toured - "come on, either bury your differences and tour, or else give it up".
And LMJ has been in Australia playing with Nick Cave abd Warren Ellis. Maybe there is more to this story.
Nobody is saying anything about Charlie Watts being replaced after a 120 years. I think Larry Mullen Jr.'s health problems are probably more serious than we are lead to believe.
Las Vegas residency - the nature of those concerts says it all ...They're not doing those shows for the original U2 fans, but they'll be racking in on those jolly casino tourists in search of a fun - uncheap - little night out, who might recognize a couple of songs at best, and wouldn't even know who the heck Larry Mullen Jr. is anyway. And you're right, Rick: it's really sad to see all those great bands that we love for the great music they once produced slowly fade away, and be so desperate to recreate their magic from the past, at all cost. Once the well runs dry, no need to keep digging...
As a fan who has loved them since 1985, I think they should call it quits. Honestly boys, end on a good note.
Wait until 'Songs of Surrender' comes out - with classic songs rearranged in lower keys so Bono can sing them live without breaking a sweat. That'll really stir things up with the fans. I wouldn't be surprised if they do that with most of 'Achtung Baby' in concert this fall.
They used to be good but like most bands who go on too long, creativity grinds to a halt ...they go out year after year doing pension tours to crowds trying to recapture their youth..you wouldn't find me at these gigs if they were free
Vegas is where good bands go to die
Thought I'd heard Larry was taking time off, and it was being done with his blessing.
The new drummer is Conor McGregor
Bono, is it getting better?
My theory about the U2 residency is more about being part of a historic event. I was in Las Vegas a month before the Super Bowl and that tv ad. The talk in Vegas is about the new sphere venue. It’s suppose to have the best sound, light, and audience experience than any venue in the world. Just seeing the venue has everyone talking about it, every cab driver I had brought it up. It’s more about being a part of history and gossip around the globe, it puts U2’s name back on the radar.
Follow the money. Bono always does.  He is his favorite recipient of his charities.
Not a U2 fan, but why does your rant bring to mind the band Yes? Talk about personal changes. Although, I've not seen them since Squire passed away. So maybe you have a point?
Not as upset as some are about this. It is almost unheard of for a band to have been together for over 40 years and still have all its original members. After all this time, if one member either had enough or physically can't do it anymore and the other members still want to play, I won't hold it against them to replace the member. Not every band will do the right thing like Zeppelin to call it quits after Bonham passed away.
Bono was once a revolutionary and a freedom fighter who spoke truth to power.  Now he's a stooge for the World Economic Forum.
Rick, I live about 15 minutes from Philly, across the Delaware River in Jersey, so it was much to my surprise when you said you saw their tour at Veteran's Stadium. Place was called a dump by everyone but for Philly sports fans like me, it was "my" dump.
U2 really should have stopped playing a lot time ago. The have been going down since 2000.
I agree that they shouldn't do it without Larry. I don't think they should stop doing shows if they don't want to. There's a lot of 70's bands with almost no original members who still tour....and let's not forget the Stones!
2019 tour was Joshua Tree, that’s with this is A-Baby. Do you even know the band?
Mostly agree with you, but you are off here. You should delete this and save face. If Larry chooses to sit out for personal reasons, who are you to criticize or know what he’s thinking. Stop man.
Remember Ringo wasn’t the original drummer and even Ringo had a replacement for a number of gigs, too. We’ll see how this turns out (if Larry returns or not).
Truth is, they were on the hook for this before his surgery issues came up. As much money as they have, they probably can’t afford to back out.
This uproar is ridiculous. The band most certainly signed  a contract to open the MSG years ago. Since then the sphere undoubtedly has other acts booked.  You can’t just break contracts nor does Larry want them too.  He is getting surgery so that he can play with U2 in the future, Vegas gigs aside.
will prolly make it out there b/c I live in Socal my kids have never seen them. But yeah, it's a far cry from the "Under a blood red sky' band that cared about their message
Yeah, this feels different, Rick, you're right. I actually didn't know Mullen wasn't playing. They mentioned in interviews at the Kennedy Center Honors that Mullen was having physical issues preventing him from potentially playing. Now, I saw the ad and I thought it was a great idea, and I have no doubt young fans know Achtung Baby. One is probably their biggest song on Spotify. But then I see you here and find out he isn't playing. Yes, guys come and go, but U2 has been the same for 47 years. It's not going to be the same. I've loved them since the early 90s, finally saw them in 2018, and this is a BAD IDEA. They're enshrined in Cleveland for a reason, but at some point, they need to see that they've done enough. They don't need to stay, "relevant," anymore. The Apple thing was an example of this, and it overshadowed a pretty good record. Anyhow, Rick, spot on as usual.
Couldn't agree more, Rick! Well we will disagree on Rattle and Hum, lol. But they absolutely should not be going out and playing shows without Larry. Obviously they're doing it to cash in.   But if Larry is recovering from some sort of illness or injury would it kill them to wait six months to a year?
I used to be really into U2, but their shtick got really stale after the 90s.
I would even prefer they play with Larry’s drum track than with another drummer!
Did the Stones play after Charlie died? Foo Fighters? INXS? Joy Division/New Order? Chic? I saw Duran Duran when Nick Rhodes was on leave, it was still an awesome concert. It might be U2's last shot at live performing.
I’m one of those old fans who followed them since the release of BOY! Larry Mullen Jr. like John Bonham and Neil Peart, cannot be replaced!
Reality; They most certainly have a large staff to support. Are they supposed to stop playing because of a drummer? Sounds absurd to me. The show must go on.
Hey Rick, I know you are  from ATL, curious if you saw U2 at the Civic Center (I believe it was the War tour, and first show here)? Unbelievable show, the energy was insane.  We saw Bono out later at a local club, he was checking out a band we both knew! (The Hollyfaith) This Vegas thing is a mess.
I think Achtung Baby was U2's best work ever...and I would say that Achtung Baby is ONE of the greatest albums of all time. Up until Achtung Baby was released, I heard of U2 and liked their music..but I was a fan after Achtung Baby. But let me say this...maybe Larry Mullen doesn't mind...maybe he's getting a very generous slice of the pie?
Isn't the Dude getting surgery and indicated he wouldn't be playing in 2023?
As Pat Metheny said in your interview, it doesn’t matter who the headliner is on the marquee, it’s the drummer. Larry Mullen is the tightest drummer I’ve ever heard. When U2 played Live Aid, he and Adam Clayton kept a vamp going in rock solid time for something like ten minutes while Bono surfed the crowd… it was amazing. I’m interested but skeptical to hear what they sound like with someone else behind the kit.
so went to a GF house and while waiting I was  watching MTV  I see this new band riding horses in the snow....
Fact is Larry has been like this since POP,most of the sings were written with a drym machine as he couldnt do the sessions,he later put his drumming onto the recorded tracks.Also Jimmy Nichol replaced ringo on the Beatles tour of Australia and they survived it.But U2 have run out new ideas musically speaking a while ago,the last few albums have been lacking to say the least.They should call it a day now.
Lets remember that the Drummer the hire is a hired gun and used for temp purposes.
But the Beatles did the same thing in June 1964. They replaced Ringo for eight dates when he was sick. No big deal.
Your rant is weird. It's as if you don't understand what is important - as if their advertising during the Superbowl, and without mentioning his absence,  is blasphemous or something..?? Of the four band members U2 could not afford to lose, the list order couldn't be more obvious - 1) Bono 2) The Edge 3) Adam Clayton and 4) Larry Mullen Jr. He will not be missed much. They will most certainly find someone as good or better than he is....  Love U2, but for what it's worth, they went downhill notably after Achtung Baby - there was nothing close to it after, and it's been a downward spiral ever since...
You hit it on the head for me Rick. I liked U2 when they were an " alternative" band. Listening to "I will follow" from Boy with my friends when it just came out blew us all away. Then October,War and I think Under a blood red sky was where they really took off in the states with live songs and videos from Red Rock. Some of their  later stuff is pretty good let's face it but so love the earlier stuff. "Gloria" from October a bit if a fave.
You are damm right!
You're a Hoot Rick!  Couldn't agree more.
From one perspective I think it is a good thing that they are being 100% upfront with their fans. Just setting an expectation. Now let's say Larry is recovered and can actually play, imagine the response to all the hard core fans. That would a big under promise over deliver
Bono need's the money. His investments may went wrong.
This band overachieved. Good stuff but it's never been a smart rock band.
U2 the most overrated band
Isn’t that what REM did? And they even had an agreement when they were going to stop, but the rest of the band wanted to continue despite that agreement. That said, isn’t Las Vegas where bands get their retirement gigs?
Getting paid $10M plus 90% of the "door" is why they just push ahead with this Rick .. It's all about he Benjamins..
U2 suck now so bad! Washed up. Haven't done a great record or tour since ATYCLB and Elevation tour. U2 1980-2002.
if U2 is the democracy we are led to believe..i'm sure Larry is right behind the decision, otherwise they wouldn't tour. he will be missed and his drumming is iconic and metronome tight. get well and cant wait for the next proper tour/album release.  "give me one more chance....you'll be satisfied....'
You keep calling them YouTube.  Rock ‘n’ roll may have started as a revolution, but it’s now an industry.
I mean...can a band substitute a drummer every 45 years or so? Overacting a bit, Rick? 🤣
Apart from the current state of world affairs, what's the rush?
Rick - Not sure you're aware of just how much Bono and Edge love money. They got a lot of flak here in Ireland for not paying their taxes after it was discovered they moved all their financial affairs to Holland. Bono defended it by simply stating 'it's not illegal to do so'. This is a guy who touts his charity work but at the same time won't pay his share of taxes which helps pays for healthcare and education desperately needed by the poorest here. They deliberately do things like charge 99c on amazon for their albums to ensure they get to the top of the charts (when other bands couldn't afford to charge such a low amount). To address your point about the Beatles and the Police - they knew when their time was up. U2 haven't written a decent tune arguably since Achtung Baby. There's a few on the follow up EP but everything after is very MOR. They're now re-recording earlier tunes. They've nothing left to say and Bono always said they'd stop when they weren't relevant and the truth is, they're not. But his ego prevents him from quitting so they do stunts like this in Vegas. I'd say Larry has just had enough and just wasn't arsed with it all.
I was fortunate enough to see U2 at a club on Long Island back in Dec. of '81. My girlfriend (future wife) and I arrived early to grab a spot right at the front of the stage. Unbelievable show... her comment to me during the show.. Bono is sweating on me !!!
U2 has just never done it for me. Just don't care for them.
Journey and Van Halen and AC/DC replaced their lead singers !    . . . The Who and Rolling Stones replaced their Drummers.  So can U2 ! . . . sorry Rick, This is not a blunder.
Why is U2 Playing Las Vegas "So Weird" ?  Seems normal to me, and I live in Las Vegas !
Even after all these years, U2 still sux.
Most U2 fans knew that Larry was scheduled to have surgery and couldn’t play this year,  Larry gave his blessing for them to do this without him.  He’s not leaving the band.  I don’t see the problem in having these 12 shows without Larry if he is Ok with it.
Love U2. They are one of my favorite bands but they are not the same.  I remember the Who doing final tour after final tour and it just got pathetic. That’s where U2 is heading
Preach on, Brother Rick!! Fully agree with this rant!!
Is it just me or is Rick saying "YouTube" almost every time he means to say "U2"? This residency really has him worked up! :D Honestly I think they probably shouldn't do it, but at least it's 3 of the original members. You want to talk about a band that is just relentlessly cashing in, how about YES? Their two longest-serving members both died, there have been NO original members since Chris Squire died in 2015, and the only remaining "classic" member is Steve Howe, who *really* should have hung it up at least a decade ago.
One for all. All four One.
I've never missed Bono
As a long time U2 fan I feel the same way, Rick. Maybe they should have retired U2 McGuiness quit…
Actung Baby is a majestic Album, but this is the second time they have regurgitated it… Now (lets face it) they are creatively spent. Bono spends more time hanging out with financiers than in the studio.. they’re done
fat elvis u2 phase of career = founder drummer optional
Is he saying “u2” or “YouTube”?
It's painfully obvious that for quite a few years U2 has bought into the laughable hype that they're an "important" band. They were definitely worth paying attention to for a couple of decades. Now? Not so much.
Larry played on Alice Cooper's Paranormal album and before going in the studio he requested the lyrics and Alice asked why and Larry explained that he plays his drums to the lyrics. Never heard of any drummer doing that before. Interesting fact to consider when listening to U2 songs again.
The driving force - because the drums and bass create the "drive". Let's give the substitute guy a chance.
I am a huge U2 Fan as well and totally agree with Rick! I saw their last tour in Germany and they weren't the same as before. I was missing the magic, the vibe and the groove. A good U2 cover band could have done it better. I also don't get this veteran Las Vegas thing... However musical skills don't have to decline with age. See the late Jeff Beck, Robben Ford or Vinnie Colaiuta...
Rick, you are spot on. I’m from Dublin and been a massive fan since ‘86. This new album of “reimagined” songs with Bono’s depleted voice and this tour without LMJ is an abomination.  They have become a cabaret band doing “anniversary” tours.  They’re done.  I sense LMJ has left but they’re committed to this and they’re delaying announcing it.  Just my two cents.
At least I would give the gig to a U2-FAN with serious drumming skills.-)
I stopped liking U2 when I realized Bono was a cog in the machine.
yeah, this is how I felt, when I found out Black Sabbath will go on the farewell tour without Bill Ward.....   hope I don't have to mention, that we all knew from day 1, that the witch of Salem was behind that whole shitshow, right 😠😠😠
Well said, Rick! U2 with Larry Mullen Jr. is *NOT* U2. He is so much of the DNA of the band. That's like replacing Bono or The Edge with some back up.
Maybe they were contractually obligated to do those Vegas shows. i'm not really sure but if that's the case they have to replace Larry temporarily. Or they can choose to not do those shows and lose a lot of money. I don't know what the current status of Larry's health is at the moment but it seems that he's not capable of playing right now.
Went to see U2 with friends, in Tampa Florida, on my Birthday in 1987. The moon was full and it was cold out. It was the best concert I have ever attended.
Larry is the most down to earth guy in this band by far. I met him backstage at Giant stadium during the Achtung Baby tour. I had a good friend who owned a record store and did rigging for Meadowlands shows I went with him. After the show there were two parties going on ….one that the band was hosting supposedly and the other was a Paul McGuinness fête. The band members and the entourage were bouncing back-and-forth between these two parties underneath the stands in the end zone where the band was set up. Noted photographer, Anton Corbin was prancing around with the best looking girls. Not bad for a guy who’s a virtual midget and pretty strange looking. I think the Edge was on the edge of his divorce at the time while Bono and Adam were busy with the parties.   Meanwhile there was a pretty high ceiling back there and a lot of empty space as you might imagine under a grandstand. The parties were going on in these big makeshift tented areas for privacy I would imagine. Right across from the parties back toward the stage, there was kind of a big walkway for forklifts and other thing. When I turned around, Larry was sitting on a rather large travel case. He was wearing a T-shirt and jeans and looking pretty sullen. I popped up on the other end of the case. Pretty sure I was wearing the same thing, v-neck t-shirt and jeans. We were roughly the same age. It was warm outside and we began to talk …he couldn’t have been more accommodating and very easy to talk to. He was married, and I think he had already started his family. He had absolutely zero interest in the parties.   During this tour, apparently what he had been doing right after shows was riding his motorcycle, a Harley Davidson I think to the next venue. In this case, Washington DC. As it turns out, we were sitting on the case that held the motorcycle. Apparently next to us there was another case, holding a similar motorcycle. This other motorcycle was for a companion/bodyguard on the tour who would ride with Larry to safeguard his trips. As luck would have it …it started to drizzle after the show. Larry was waiting for confirmation to hop on the bike and get out of there. A short while later Paul McGuinness came over to let him know there would be no motorcycle trip tonight and he handed us some champagne bottles. I’m assuming Paul did not want to be the manager of Def Leppard if you get my drift. Larry was not happy at all about the decision, and was not interested in joining the parties across the way. He talked to me for a little while longer and then I believe he went straight back to the hotel.   Like everybody on here I’ve been a fan of that band for a long time, but have lost interest over the years. Quite frankly, can’t believe the prices Bono is getting for Tickets during his run at the Beacon theater here in New York. He’s starting to morph into the Iranian dude that wrote the Satanic verses …Maybe people are spending all their China flu money on those tickets. I saw U2 on their first tour here. I still have all the early import singles, the remixes everything in pristine condition from the first three albums. I also have a giant unforgettable fire poster, a promo poster for the album. The kind that used to hang in the record stores. I believe I saw them at the Palladium downtown NYC shortly after they ripped out all the seats. It was packed, it was good, it was exciting. Bono climbed up on the PA system, waving some kind of flag or something at that point it was already getting a little obnoxious. I remember the edge looking up at him thinking dude you’re gonna take a tumble one of these days.  Then as time went by and Bono got more political this band in my opinion begin to lose their mojo. I quickly lost interest… Left-wing, politics, are juvenile, and all the woke bullshit that ensues is destructive. Yeah Rick, I might’ve been the first person to go into an Apple store and say how the hell do you get this dreck off my phone?!?!?  Now years later it’s still there, somehow it comes back on the phone and PLAYS ITSELF or when you change phones or whatever… like Jacob Marley rattling his chains. Tim Cook has destroyed Apple, kind of like Bono has destroyed U2…  Not sure how well-known it is, but Larry, like most drummers has had carpal tunnel issues in the past. If you’re smacking those things hard over time it’s gonna be problematic. I pray for Larry and his family that it’s not something worse. I’ve seen him from time to time up in Nyack, New York. He has a property up there and occasionally he’s out there in town. There’s a proper Irish pub and the food is actually excellent.. I’ll let you figure out which one, there’s two… Look for Lenny the Kiwi bartender you’ll know you are in the right place….
Enough is enough? Not sure if you are implying that they should disband. Saw them for the Joshua Tree tour in Oakland, and like others have stated, yes it’s disappointing that Larry won’t be able to play these shows. I don’t sense that this is a permanent replacement. Even the Beatles during their world tour in 1964 had to sub in Jimmie Nicol when Ringo was ill, so huge bands have had to deal with this. I think we’re confusing a temporary substitution with a permanent replacement (which hasn’t been announced). Larry started the band, he is the reason why U2 exists. Beyond the Vegas shows….time will tell if he wants to continue or stop and I will support him either way. They’ve always said that all four of them have to agree or they don’t proceed. I hope that’s still the case. I wish Larry a speedy recovery.
Loved Achtung Baby, basically my introduction to the group, but quickly grew to hate Bono so stopped paying attention.   But yeah, the drummer and bass player drive the band. .
Im on day whatever (of 43.5 years) without knowing an actual U2 Fan
I’ve seen a Sammy Hagar interview just after he was fired from Van Halen and he said “Bad manegement can kill anything”, referring to everything that happened in the band after Alex's brother-in-law joined as manager. This is really true ….
Name me a band,(of this caliber) that hasn't temporarily  used a replacement member...........I'll wait.  T
They probably don't care. They are looking at $$$$$. Hope you are doing well Larry. You're the beat that U2 relies on.
I saw U2 at the Capitol Theater in March of 1983...The venue was almost empty...The show was awesome...Sorry to say U2 faded away almost 30 years ago....
All about Money...
It’s been a long time that u2 isn’t the same. This gig couldn’t be any where else than LV. The perfect spot to do empty gigs. Doesn’t look at all to the band that make history countless times. Red rocks it’s about to colapse, with this News! And what about this 40 songs collection! Tell me about Rick! 😢
Given your entire rant, you do know that this will sell out every night right? Also the the venue has the potential to be better than the band.
Cash grab at its finest.
To be fair, the band members know the real reason. Hopefully it’s not something serious.  I agree though that whatever the reason, they should wait to include LMJ.
I saw the Zoo TV Tour in 1992 at Camp Randall--one of the best concerts I ever went to. Love Achtung Baby
It's gonna be a dutch drummer. :-) :   Bram van den Berg from Krezip... pretty weird.
I agree wholeheartedly. I saw the ad and investigated. U2 in Vegas- awesome. But then I read no Larry, and the bubble burst. I’ll pay top $ a U2 Vegas show, but this isn’t U2, is it?
How many Marshall Amps do you have ???
U2......dont know what to say. really?
Rick, couldn’t agree with you more. Larry's drumming on Achtung Baby is iconic... They are playing Vegas, right... Sooo, instead they could do their favorite Cover songs with a replacement drummer ;-)  Not U2 songs... And especially not "Achtung baby". For now, at least, we are assuming that Larry Mullen Jr. will be back with the band?
I like U2 way back.  They are too whiney and leftie and I'm NOT Political.  I think they Suck now.  Once the Politricks overrides the Music..It's GAME OVER.
Has anyone asked Larry what he thinks about this? Maybe it was his idea ? I don’t really care about U2, but it’s funny to me how much people confuse a band that once was with a BRAND that they now are.
Man, what a great video!!!  I totally agree with you!!! Thank you for telling everyone the truth...
I got into U2 with their first album, "Boy." A lot of my friends were quite skeptical of them at the time, but I said, you just wait! I went to see them play a bar in Buffalo on their October tour. I think a lot of this depends on timing. Maybe Larry was originally supposed to do these shows, but then his health issues came up? By then, contracts had been signed, etc. I imagine these residencies are planned very far ahead of time, and involve a lot of money. Maybe by that point they couldn't back out of it? I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. The point remains, if you don't want to see U2 without Larry, then just don't spend your money and go to any of these shows.
By that logic, it would be next to impossible to see a classic rock band live. It doesn't matter to me if Cetera is playing with Chicago, I'm going to go.   Oh, the Marshall Tucker band is down to just one original member? I'll go see for $30. It's still good music.      Did your lead singer die? I guess the rest of y'all might as well go to the old age home and forget about it.
Haven't read all the comments............agree w/you Rick....but sadly methinks there may be something more to this "temp(?) replacement"?
I'm sure most casual fans don't even know his name much less care who is behind the kit.
I'm assuming Larry's way of expressing 'its over...' take a hint, gents.
I will reserve judgement on this until the results are in. I think it is important that Larry take care of his health issue. Look at what happen to Tom Petty who went on a major tour without taking care of some serious health issues first. That tour killed him. I think a capable drummer will be fine for a temporary fill in and perhaps will bring something new to the songs. The Stones did well with Steve Steve Jordan as replacement drummer for the late Charlie Watts in their last round of touring. I think your too caught up in the Super Bowl ad.
Agreed. And is fans don’t like your opinion they can delete it from their library
Rolling Stones
I agree with you completely i hate it when bands do this Larry has been their original drummer going on decades and this is disrespectful  to him and the fans especially these so called new ones who have never seen or heard him play live. It’s basically a fucking cash grab which is weird considering how much a super bowl commercial costs.
What about the Stones????
I heard that Bono is working on a badass, super-punk, Cedarwood-Road-fist-fight worthy duet with Barry Manilow while playing along his 3 inseparable childhood friends, you know the ones that grew up together in that oh so tough Dublin neighborhood and that would play together until death do them apart .....  blah blah blah ... the problem with Bono and by extension U2 is not the multiple questionable decisions they've been making since the Paul McGuinness days but the BS that always precede them. I'd say the criticisms are deserved. Fan since 1982 here....
He's acting like this is the first time a band has ever played without their original drummer.
Larry has had Back problems for years.  Pray He has a quick recovery ❤️‍🩹.
Last time I saw them much of the percussion was pre-reocrded tracks, so I don't really care to see them, with any drummer.
Trust the Gen Z fan base to love U2. They’re our kids after all. We can stick to Red Rocks.
It’s Larry’s band!
Rick , I totally agree with you. Where is loyalty, fidelity, respect? I can't believe that.  I'm 56 years old, a U2 from the beginning, and never had the opportunity to be in a U2 concert because they never went to my country.  Now I have the opportunity, but you know what  I don't want to,  It's a shame.
Will Bono be wearing his original sun glasses? 🕶
How many times have we heard about bands and their idiotic management? Be they corrupt, short sighted, heavy handed, inept or greedy, the net effect is the same. Larry is to U2 what Bonzo was to Zeppelin where their respective techniques and sound are concerned in that both are so easily identifiable. Been a fan for decades and bought every album since "Boy" was released. This is a new world with a new paradigm, all I can do is give a headshake and eyeroll.   We hear ya Rick.
U2 is playing Vegas.  I'm officially old.
I listened to your video carefully. It's simple: you're right. It's just a bad decision.
Do it when Larry can be a part of it. If that isn't going to happen at any point, then just be honest about it.
No more u2 for me, especially with Bono.
I read an article in a newspaper about a dutch guy has been asked to play the drums in u2. Don't know his name.
he was just here in istanbul
I dunno what the deal is but I'm guessing a contract is a contract, something like that. Won't quite be the same without him.
It's a good opinion and you are bloody right.
They shouldn't go out and play without the original members. They should see if they possibly could come up with another Record that is truly great. And I mean better then the last ones.. in that case they could tour that with the original members. Otherwise they should just call it quits. Such a great legacy, such a shame to spoil it or stain it by seeming to greedy.
If the Rolling Stones can play without Charlie Watts , U2 can play without a recovering Larry Mullen Jr. !  Nobody is IRREPLACABLE, not even maybe God himself. Personally I think it is easier for the replacement drummer to deliver the original 1992 beats than it is for 'God's good voice' to reimmulate the vocals of Achtung Baby.   The biggest problem is that the devotional disciples of U2 find it hard to conceive that the 4 apostles are a normal band, for whom money matters.  (Which I find hard to believe they would not already know a long time ....)
Good point made here Rick , sorry to say : Nobody of us exactly knows how deals & contracts are made with tours from artists&bands such as the Stones , Genesis or U2 , and hard to see in wich Condition Mullen Jr will be for the future , but your point When's Enough is enough is very Valid to me :  Eagles vs Don Felder , The Who without Moon or Entwistle same thing really for example
I’m not a fan of rehashing old albums and I’m really nervous about Songs if Surrender. Is this move to play without Larry - the heart and soul of U2  - the end of the band? I hope not.
Every time he says U2 it sounds like he's saying YouTube
Maybe somon made dem an offa de couldnt refuse?
Well said Rick. I've been a U2 fan since 1980 but their (Bono and The Edge) ever expanding ego's have turned me off. Larry in some ways is U2. We would never have heard of them without him
Love the rant, I took it a different way. This to me, talks about their band and thing being bigger than any one of them. It speaks about mortality and the lack of  ego from Larry Mullen Jr. They are not being selfish, it is a band decision that they are preparing themselves and fanbase for in case one of them pack it in unexpectedly as so many of their contemporaries have been doing lately. Love the Beato channel!
Being a U2 fan of 20+ years and "Achtung Baby" being the best U2 album of all times (in my opinion), I 100% agree! "Achtung Baby" has Larry Mullen Jr. all over it.
Maybe he just doesn’t want to do it. Whats the problem. This is just click bait.
And? Larry Mullen is unable to play, will have a surgery. You could have cancelled the concert, got into contract trouble, lost millions, and who knows when Larry recovers and when in the schedule you can repeat the concerts.    And the fans would not have heard the U2 songs live at all.    So they get 3/4 the original, the replacement Bram van den Berg is apparently instructed by Larry, so is completely OK with that.      In any case it is way better than Phil Collins who has to give up and there is ZERO chance that he will come back.
I thought it was common knowledge that Larry was seriously injured and his recovery is going to take a while? Perhaps I have been given the wrong info?  Also in Sydney on 26 November, 1993 Adam Clayton didn't make it to a show. The show still went on and we all had a great night (I was at both Sydney shows 26 and 27).  I believe this band can still perform without one of it's members but it will be sad.
Airline tickets are high. Bono needs the extra cash to buy seats for his hat.
I AGREE WITH ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING YOU SAID HERE. wtf???
I couldn’t agree with you more Rick! You summed up EXACTLY how I feel as a decades long U2 fanatic! I slept on the pavement overnight to get tix to the original Joshua Tree tour in Vancouver BC. I travelled to Dublin as a teenager and walked the streets listening to Streets on my Walkman … I flew from Munich to Seattle for a weekend to see the opening of the Vertigo tour…now I couldn’t be bothered…and wait till we see the ticket prices!🤯🤮
Who are you to say what they should or shouldn’t do? You’re not their mother.
I love what you do, Rick Beato, but you’re a studio guy. Stay in your lane and don’t try to tell bands what to do. No one can break a song down like you. But being a genius studio rat  doesn’t translate to knowing how to make choices for band careers. Telling U2 to give it up, comparing them to the Beatles and the Police—because you personally are not pleased with what they are doing? This kind of drivel makes you sound like an out-of-the-industry fan boy, quite honestly.   Bottom line, like most giant bands, U2 are in your vocabulary because they made their own choices, and did what they want. YOUR choice is to follow them or not.   Most bands fall off this tightrope of recognition before they even set foot on it. So far, U2 has managed to do quite well for many decades. And even with all original members playing every show.  Real life isn’t studio concoctions, record covers and legendary stories. It’s people. People who make choices, go to hospitals, get criticized—and mostly fail, to be honest. Telling anyone in music to “give it up” is rotten and just a crappy thing to do.  I love what you do, but this rant was cheap, disappointing, very peanut-gallery-y and screamed lack of on-the-ground experience. I hope you don’t do more of these, because you’ll lose me as a subscriber.
Apparently they aren’t listening to you bro… find something else to talk about
Rick that was the first u2 songs I heard lol man did I get tired on listening to those songs😂
Rick is giving U2 grief for continuing as a band. I have to disagree. While their creativity is not the same as it was in the 80s and early 90s, they still rock and are obviously still in high demand.   I guess we will have to see how it shakes out with Larry’s health, but as long as they continue to be genuine, and people want to see them, I say let’s rock!
Bono is a joke. The Edge is quite possibly the most overrated musician ever. Wait for Larry. Two words, Def Leppard.
I actually have a lot to say on this. For one thing, the fill-in guy is just that: a fill-in guy. I sincerely doubt he’s replacing Larry forever.  If he was playing with them, though, I kind of doubt that would satisfy Rick and others since he capped off the video with the “enough is enough, I can name two other bands who stopped touring.” Yes, LV residencies are a sign of hasbeenoitude but there’s also the option of not going to them especially if you aren’t in or going to Vegas anyway.  I also never got on the bandwagon of bashing them for the free album. Yeah maybe it should have been just something you could download at the store, but IT’S A FREE ALBUM!!! Ingrates.  Finally, is it really so hard to believe that people who weren’t teenagers or young adults when “Auchtung Baby,” came out got into it later on? How many fans of the Beatles or Led Zeppelin weren’t even born when they were around? I know I wasn’t.  I… I just don’t agree with Rick’s take.
As long as they keep Chicken salesman Lillywhite out of it
Bono is the biggest tool around
i am a big u2 fan for many years and i have to agree with this.  i think they are destroying their legacy with "bad" decisions....U2 are the most unique band in history for many reasons one of which is the origianl lineup NEVER changed in the bands 40+ year history! a feat unheard of in rock or any other genre.  U2 are not U2 without each of those 4 founding fathers!  Queen getting a new vocalist YEARS after freddys death got a lot of stick but thats different , the lead signer was no longer with us and the band wanted to perform so they found someone who could NEVER replace Freddy )thats impossible) but someone who could at least at ther love of freddy to theie own performance adn it worked!  LARRY is very much alve and kicking (despite his personal health issues) and I feel that it is disrespecfull to not only him but also the legion of U2 fans for the other 3 to take the stage  without him!  U2 are running out of steam and thats fine, it comes with age, Bono cant run laps fo the stage like he did 20 years ago and that energy about them has disappated over the last number of years so I feel they would be best to do TOURS like the Joshua Tree 30th show back in 2017 which was receivd to much acclaim....they dont even need to  write new material /new records.....artists today would DIE to have their back catalogue  not to mention the tonne of music that hit the cutting room floor!   Paul McGuiness was the greatest manger any band could have asked for and was with them right from their humble beginnings...........i think they didint even need a new manager when he retired.....what fo THEY need a manager for???! they are in their 60s (twilight of their careers) they have achieved EVERYTHING in music have more MONEY they can spend!  I seriously dont get it! and of all things a VEGAS resisdency....that was of for ELVIS but comon he never toured outside the US.......u2 have sold out STADIUMS WORLDWIDE for the last 4 decades! i am SPEECHLESS at this move!  i thought with Bono doing his book tour was in a way his swan song....  and he was going to devote his time to other things which would suit me just fine..........DONT BURN YOUR LEGACY BOYS!
The Who?  Still doing farewell tours...
Seems to me (extremely amateur) that a critic that has issues with an aging band’s evolution and adaptation to new realities is actually responding to that critic’s own waning vigor above all. Also, whoever has seen Bono’s “Surrender” tour (still going on) must realize that innovation is still where it’s at for Bono, at least. The Vegas thing will open up new experiences for lots of people. “Let it be.”
QUEEN and Adam Lambert and they are doing Great 👍🏻  U2 can do what they want  There are plenty of fans that want to see and hear them
Songs of Surrender is trash. I hate it. Let’s take classic songs and destroy them bc we have no new ideas. I’ve been a fan since ‘86, sold drums to see Achtung Baby and have a tattoo. Geniuses in their prime, every song after ‘92 is suspect. It’s long past time to retire. It’s kind of embarrassing.
Glad I gave up on them when Achtung Baby came out.
The first time I saw them was St Patty's Day at The Ritz in NYC. A bagpipe band opened for them. U2 is the one band that translated well from clubs to stadiums.
No self respecting human being likes U2..
I guess Bono isn’t rich enough….
If Larry has given his blessing then i don’t have a problem.
Thing is U2 could have easily not booked any shows until Larry was better.... They would have known way before now that he needed medical care...Sounds a little strange to me ..
I gotta think that they locked into a contract before they found out Larry couldn't make it.  There's too much money on the line.  I'm sure they have a whole crew that is depending on them to tour.  Exodus did a show without Gary a few years ago.  ZZ Top is touring without Dusty.  The Rolling Stones toured without Charlie.  Black Sabbath toured without Bill.  Vicious Rumors did a show without Geoff.
Mr. Beato, You are spot on with your opinion piece. I have been a U2 fan since 1980 and frankly I think it's time for the band to hang up their proverbial cleats and call it a career. Dave from Canada
It's the zio manager.
They lost the plot years ago,  don't even know themselves if they're for good or evil.
Please Listen To Bono With An Open Mind, He’s Noisy , He Makes A Dreadful Noise, U2 Pulled The Wool , And Became Very Wealthy , Give Us Music Lovers A Break, And Retire, Call It A Day, 19.02.2023.
Okay Rick, let's see if you're consistent. It has been 5 years since Glenn Frey died and still, Don Henley continues to bastardize the name of a great band founded by he and Glenn Frey. Why? It can't be for money because these guys are set for life. So, in my opinion, I can no longer respect Don Henley because when you lose the pillar of the group you put it to bed. Here's the thing, why would a band like U2 ever agree to play a residency gig in Las Vegas? And, if there wasn't a clause in the contract that released the band from a contractual obligation in the event of health issues, I'd be very surprised. Given the number of musicians or bands who have had to cancel performances due to COVID, I can't imagine that U2 would ever walk on a stage without the full 4 member band intact. I certainly wouldn't buy a ticket to see these shows without Mullen no more than I'd buy a ticket to see the eagles without Glenn Frey.
U2 Are One Of The Most Overrated Bands EVER, And As For Bono, A Poser , An Opinionated 10th Rate “Frontman” Look At All The Truly Great Frontmen, U2 , A Noisy Band , With An Imposter Bono Up Front. 19.02.2023.
Yeah I got into u2 I was GI in Frankfurt Germany,, 1984 or something.. it just fit that vibe Hearing it over there, it's a whole nother world.. Sunday Bloody Sunday and New Year's Day.. It's just,, I wish I was there now
Sad, I've loved that band since Boy. This getting old thing sucks.
I agree Rick. I have also seen the only U2 show ever, where Adam Clayton didn't play. This was the Zoomerang / Achtung Baby tour Sydney in early 90s.
The Beatles replaced Ringo for some live shows
The only good U2 is old U2.
Big fan since 1982 here ... for me, the U2 wheels started to fall off in 2000 (All that you can't leave behind) and the subsequent set of BS records where the band would be oh so punk, oh so back to the basics ... except that the music became bland and mainstream, the exact thing they were not supposed to be in the first place. I kid you not, the morning of the Super Bowl I was thinking U2 will sooner or later start touring Vegas.... The fact that Bono has been peddling his book in the morning TV shows pretty much told me the writing was on the wall. I suspect Larry's medical condition is an exaggerated excuse because Larry himself probably doesn't want to play in Vegas anyway. This tour is yet another money grab just like the endless string of remixes, special editions, etc. etc. etc. Quite sad to see. I've been listening to War a lot lately - one of my favorites. 'Twas magical back then. Now, the thrill is gone.
A 15 or 20 million dollar ad for a Las Vegas residency? Shite! That tells you what they expect to bring in on the shows and turn a profit. Also, consider that it wasn’t U2 that had this done but the hotel/venue they will be playing at that is promoting it to insure maximum profit. Finally, I’m sure whether Larry is there or not, he will get his full 25% share. It’s not the end of the world if he’s not there for this , knowing he will return later. I also noticed you did not mention the Stones continuing to tour without Charlie Watts while having been around a good decade + longer than U2.
I think it’s been nice that Larry, Adam, and David have drug Paul this far in life.
REM. Bill Berry. Let the lads play.
i suppose if the band wants to do it, and people show up to see them, it really doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.
It's wild they are going to do it without him. Larry was rocking Brady snares on that tour. I was in a Band that toured with them doing the zoo tour. I can't see another drummer doing that Gig.
100 % agree, it seems its the end for u2, lets face it, they haven't been right since Paul retired.
Rick! Longtime listener, first time caller....would you ever do an episode on completely unknown bedroom producers? You might be able to guess why I'm asking...and it's true! I make weird music with zero theory and absolutely zero music education.....so after watching alot of these vids...I said to myself 'Self....I wonder what Rick Beato would think of one of my weird little songs?'
The real 5th member is Terry Lawless who plays all the keys and triggers loops from beneath the stage.  A true legend of a guy
Other than “The Unforgettable Fire” and everything that came before, U2 have been a dad rock band for almost 40 years.
Bono and the Edge enter a pub in Dublin, the barman looks at them and it says; "Oh no! U2 again?
All of your points are valid, except for the part where you seem to advocate retirement in order to maintain purity.  That to me is a step too far.  I would rather have a u2 in the world than not,  just like the Stones.  Also, I'm sure there is more to this story than is being revealed.  My guess would be that Larry has been trying therapies for years now and they haven't worked.  Now it's at the point where it's questionable when or if he will ever be able to tour with the band again, and it's possible that U2 is letting the fans down easy.  I hope that's not the case, but either way, the situation must be more serious than they are letting on.
Achtung baby live shows were a 'You had to be there at the time' scenario as this was the 80's becoming the 90's musically, the changes were drastic and incredible, out with the pastels and soft pop into hard bleak beats and grooves and touches of glam rock in there with great simple guitar riffs, It made it OK to be rock stars again. In 2023 I don't think anyone younger will understand the dynamic of it all, From Hansa by the wall in Berlin to Las Vegas, I think not
U2 have become everything they said they would never be.
You're right. They should all give it up because the drummer got sick. Although if I were the drummer and original creator, I think my value would go up with the ad on the Super Bowl and would be happy to know Rick Beato was prompted to make a video promoting it also. Your right though. It would be best to just stay quiet and go unnoticed and forgotten.
Celine Dion retired leaving the stage for U2!!   Hahahaha
Boy!
Totally agree!!! Hey Rick. U should tell the Stones the same thing about stop playing without Charlie Watts!!!
Hopefully Larry is ok & recovers soon. However, I can understand the band preforming without him & wouldn’t doubt they have Larry’s blessing to do so. Seems Larry has kept wanting to call it a day ever since the Rattle & Hum tour completed. Every album since the band has to plead and convince Larry to do another album starting with Achtung. I would absolutely miss Larry not not playing his iconic drums driving the band live, but understand the band wanting to preform. Also Bono vocally may feel he only have so many years left. Not to mention with Covid Achtung didn’t get a 30 year anniversary like they did for Joshua Tree. Both being their most iconic albums; Achtung deserves some kind of celebration as well.
Some fill in drummer........with all due respect. Give the guy some respect. To dare to step up and step into Mullen's shoes and do this. This is not his fault , but he will probably get all the trash thrown over him.
U2 is sadly one big case of selling out ... & I'm not referring to ticket sales.
Tell us how you really feel!!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Great rant, Rick!!!
Yeah, crazy.  One of the longest running bands with an original line up.  Oy!
Really Really...... arey the replacing , I dont think so... I think you know how contacts work.......We all want Larry .....
Larry can't play?? How could they play without him??
Fell in love with U2 with their Live at Red Rocks album and went backward and forward in their collection from there.  Sadly I've never seen them live and without Larry at the residency, I'm not sure I will soon.
I went to the Achtung Baby/ZooTV show in 1992 in Houston, TX. My friend had an extra ticket. I was fairly anti-U2/anti-non metal at the time, but who passes up a free ticket? That show made me a convert, it was really stupendous.
Maybe Negativland can fill in the Vegas gig until Larry gets better. 😊
I love U2 and I also love my fellow Dutch band Krezip since they started about 23 years ago. Very proud of Bram and sure he will do a great job
Achtung Baby! is in the same category as "The Black Album" for me. An album that killed dead my interest in a band that I really liked up till that point in time.
Rick that was a great post. I was ready to light you on fire. I thought YOU, a person I enjoy and trust was going to go negative on my beautiful band. I will never doubt you again. No band is as close to my heart as U2. From first hearing them on an underground radio station from San Francisco, to first seeing them on the Tom Snyder show, U2 was my band. Before that, music was what everyone else enjoyed and I listened too. One of the first images that comes to my mind in regards to U2 is Larry playing the intro to Sunday Bloody Sunday at Redrocks or him riding a horse with a drum on his back through the winter of Sweeden. How important is Larry to me in the whole of U2. More important than Elvis Aaron Presley was to rock'n roll in my eyes, and I LOVE Elvis. No one member of U2 is more important than the next. Simply put into perspective. Would you replace Bono? Never. Replace the Edge's guitar style? Adam's bass (my personal favorite bassist ever!)? Larry is not replaceable, even for a brief moment. Great post, you are becoming one of my favorite rock voices.
I became a U2 fan w Achtung Baby and it sounds really weird to see sby else drumming the album. Es muy raro esto.
I nervkkmew you made medicine for nose and such. Good to know where to find it
U2 was THE band that made me pick up music and guitar - I was born in 93 and the release that changed my life was Slane Castle's live DVD. By watching that gig/performance countless times, my life changed. And yes, I studied back their catalog since the beginning and even when I started not enjoying their newer albums as much, I always respected the way they tried to change and keep their identity at the same time. It's also impossible to think about touring/big shows without recognizing U2's importance in this (the Zoo TV tour was monumental here). I respect them a lot, respect and enjoy their music and lose count to the amount of stuff I see other bands going for/doing that wasn't started by them.  Having said all this, they should stop. If not now, soon. If they want to make a residency in Vegas, fine; if they don't all agree, don't. And Larry has expressed a few times over the years the will to kind of stop the band - no new stuff, no big and long tours. Bono is, and has been, pushing for a while. But it's just not right. It's sad to see, not only a super influential band, but the band that changed my life not be able to recognize that it's time to slow down, stop completely or just change the approach to music. Thank you Rick for your opinion and for the extra info you shared - I was not aware of the management changes. And while I agree with you, that these weren't very good choices, it's difficult for me to understand how the band can't clearly see that these weren't good decisions.
Playing Las Vegas is the surest sign that an artist (or band) has lost their mojo, and are just out for the cash grab. Sad to see U2 resign themselves to this level of mediocrity.
Rick, I love this topic because it’s part of a bigger thought exercise on when is enough, enough? And also trustworthy band/manager relationships. U2 has a great live show but without Larry Mullen, Jr.? It’s a circus performance. Bono had a great line in “Mofo” off the Pop record: “Mama, you left and made me someone / now I’m still a child / no one tells me no” He knows he needs good people in his life to anchor him to reality because since the age of 17 he’s been famous. Without those people he does dumb Bono things, becomes a caricature of himself. I loved your insight here about new management and how this may have led to their decision. (As someone who has seen at least a dozen U2 live shows and still am threatening to drag my partner to one, I feel a need to say “I mayyyyy still need to go see them in Vegas though.”) 😂
After some 45 years, I thought U2 might be the one band who could make it to the finish line without losing any original members. U2 without Larry is not a good thing. And here I thought the album full of bad remakes was the worst thing they were going to do this year.  Been a fan of this band since day one, but I don't get this at all.
Let's not forget zooropa
Larry's just recuperating from back surgery... at least... he will be soon!  (Don't read into any of this non-sensical drivel about him quitting the band.) It's pure rubbish!
Wow a band with no more backbone.  Larry Mullen Jr is one of the most underrated drummer ever.  No he's not performance oriented and does not display a huge set of skills but he is the steadiest stadium drummer ever.  This guy got stadiums full of people to dance and move to his simple  but brilliantly crafted drum beats.  He's a different kind a genius but a genius nonetheless !!!!!
I wonder what would happen if Bono had simialr health problems. Would they run the ad and just replace the singer?
Hey what do you think of David Bowie`s Guitar lick at the end of ``Moonage Daydream`` ? I think its one of the most underrated guitar licks of all time
Rick is all warmed up, got his blood moving, and is now ready to talk Hyundais and Kias with Scotty Kilmer.
He's recovering from surgery. Get over it. They have Larry's blessing. Period.
Drummers spontaneously combust all the time and can be replaced.
No Bonham, No Led Zeppelin. No Larry Mullen Jr, No U2. If I see them again, and I've seen them many times... it'll be after Larry comes back.
I never understood that fascination of people with U2. Joshua Tree was OK and they have their style and perhaps they were a "voice" of one or two generations. But come on, they are not at the level of Yes, Allman Brothers, or The Beatles and other giants. U2 is mostly a pop culture phenomenon. In particular, there is minimal melodic component in their music.
Hey Rick,  I’m sure this is having to be done because contracts are in place and they have to do the shows.  ( probably got paid up front) It sounds like Larry has to have some unexpected surgery and now they are forced to move ahead with a replacement for the shows
U2 is the ONLY band to stay relevant and stay together for their entire, continuous journey. They are still relevant. Their last album was as good as their 1st, or 2nd or 3rd or.. and arguably their best
jack black is replacing the Edge on the gig. And Bono.
IMHO, Rick is spot on here.  Personally, I think last U2 album worth listening to was Achtung Baby (I saw them for that tour). After that, they kept on declining, becoming a very rich, wealthy joke. That's about it, really.
Rick, you were at Aloha Stadium if ‘06 for Pearl Jam & U2? Nice, I was at that awesome show as well. Not the greatest acoustics in that rust bucket but a great show nonetheless.
You nailed it Rick....nothing else to say....
*Hello...Hello...! Yeah...Yeah...Yeah...Yeah...Yeah...Yeah...Yeah...Yeah...Yeah...!*
Rattle and hum was so offensive to me that I quit listening to them. I randomly heard something from Achtung Baby,and was back on board for that ans Zooropa. Pop sucked, and other than a few songs on Atomic Bomb,they've been shite
This is a bad move for U2. It will bite them in the ass.
Count de Monet.  Period.
A new manager coming into a huge band would not get that much...  probably 5% tops.
$$$
A musician dies and goes to heaven. Looking around he  sees  a lot of rock stars and remarks to a person standing close: "Sorry, is this Bono? I did not knew he died."   - "No this is God. But he believes he is Bono."
PROFESSOR FIG ?????
Led Zeppelin toured years after...
The Larry Mullen Jr quartet, aka “U2” have been my #1 favorite band since 1985 when I first heard “Pride (In the name of love)” and the rest of unforgettable fire. I was excited about this residency and was making plans to go but no Larry? Doesn’t seem right. I’ll probably still go because I haven’t seen U2 since the 360 tour in 2009 and Achtung Baby is such an amazing album but it won’t be the same.
Still would like you to review Prince.
It's just bad timing. They were booked to open the Sphere before it was determined that Larry needed surgery before he could play again. The Sphere is going to be the most unique venue on the planet, until the second one opens in London in a couple years, and seems almost built for U2. They are never going to get this opportunity again, and even if they postpone they won't be first. And if they did postpone, it would probably be two or three years before they could do the shows, after the next album and tour. And then there's still no guarantee that Larry will be able to play again after surgery. So I don't doubt it was a difficult decision that wasn't taken lightly, and I believe Larry is on board with it.
Honestly, this seems like "much ado about nothing" to me. Rick keeps referring to "some fill-in drummer" as if they are going to get some guy from a local vegas pick up band to replace Larry Mullen, Jr. Come on, there are probably 100 session drummers in Los Angles that will be able to play the exact riffs that Larry did on the original recordings. The band will make a lot of money (and I'm sure Larry will get a slice) and the fans will get to hear a great band. It's a win/win, except for the harping critics.
Milking  the cow to the end, the Irish way ! Or killing the golden goose !   Mullins probably spoke to the lads in Ballymon and they said don’t do it…. Ego is a terrible thing when you can’t control it !!!!(Bono)
Questions of artistic integrity and fan entitlement aside for one moment, I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that Larry was cool with it and will get a chunk of the $$$$$$$ that the brand (not band) U2 is going to earn from taking the contract for a high-profile gig that will somehow already be sold out seconds after tickets go on sale.
When I heard "fill in drummer", at first I thought it was "villian drummer", which is how some fans will see him.
When Bono had his bike accident a handful of years ago, the band was slated to play a televised gig, and they had a number of star singers fill in for him. Didn't go too well. They came out & said at the time that they wouldn't do such a thing again. Well, here we are.
Rick, let's just say What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas - I always feel like I am in some alternate universe when I visit that place anyway :)
I think you swung and missed on this one, Rick.
Even the Beatles had a fill in drummer on one tour. Look up Jimmie Nicol.
I'd go for the Achtung, ZOOROPA and POP tunes....Those three CDs belong in 2023, not 1993.
- I’ve been a U2 fan since the early 80’s but I still wanted to delete that album from my iPhone on principal. Bono can spare me all his altruistic humanitarian lectures while he goes on his money grab. Every time I got in my car an that album started playing by itself I wanted to throw my phone out the window.
Can’t stand u2, but you can’t deny the uniqueness of the drum parts.
Aerosmith did the same thing
No Larry?! No like-Ee ;(
Not a big U2 fan due to not understanding all the adulation for the worst rhythm section in music.
The tax evasion and hypocritical, preachy and overlong Bono speeches weren't enough to make one think; What are they doing?
I ABSOLUTELY love your channel Rick; I access your INCREDIBLE information, track isolation deconstruction & opinions OFTEN.  However, indeed, your "rant" (as you humbly made mention to) I DO accept, but solely as 'opinion' or 'commentary'.  May I explain?  Coming from being a drummer myself, since 14 years of age...then much, much later in my life (age 55) having to go under the sharp knife and brave an "A.L.I.F." (Anterior approach to Lumbar Interbody Fusion) of the L4/L5 Disc, was one of the scariest, but needed, moments of my life.  Kudos & High Congratulations to the IMPECCABLE staff of Cedars-Sinai of Los Angeles/Marina del Rey and renowned USC Tojans/L.A. Dodgers Spinal Surgeon Dr. Robert Watkins, MD...this procedure...this MAJOR OPERATION, which also included a highly experienced Vascular Surgeon to "CUTT-My-GUTT-Open" to allow Watkins to approach the highly degenerated disc at the aforementioned L4/L5 section; replace it with a bone grafted apparatus, install 6 titanium screws & end plate for stability...saved my ability to walk, sit & stand...and yes, it can give "back" the ability for a drummer in his early to mid 60s (Mr. Larry Mullen, Jr.) to sit on his drum throne....and play, once again.  It is my dear hope, that Mullen, the original founder of U2, undergoes the most successful spinal surgery ever; whether he chooses a skilled surgical staff in the UK, or here in the US.  Spinal Surgery is no cake-walk...BUT...as mentioned, this may just be able to put HIM "back" where he belongs...AND...loves to be, in the Drummer's Seat, of U2.  Thank you Rick.  BolsaChicaRadio
I like u2 but I was absolutely repulsed when they teamed up with apple and forced their album on iPhone users. That album may have been ok, but the way it was pushed on me made me hate it. It was a tacky, sad move and very much not rock and roll. Just my rambling opinion.
I’ve noticed a lot of Sting sings being used for silly pop songs is this a consequence of selling your publishing rights that anyone can use these now?
Pure greed by the band , all residents in Ireland but they refuse to pay Tax that they can well afford there . Leaving public services which serve their fans and employees there without the cash they need . They call themselves a Christian band . I wonder what Jesus would have to say about it . And no I’m not religious. Hypocrites!
Big fan of U2. Saw many shows here in Melbourne late 80s to 2010. They should have called it quits not long after 2010. Some just don't know their time is up.
The Stones without Charlie or Keith. Some things should stop.
dont tell them to roll over and die just because Larry is not available  - they are amazing even without Larry     Good decision for U2
Pop was their last shot at greatness in 1997 - a lifetime ago. Since 2004, everything has been sh*t. Yet since then, they’ve made more money than most of the bands in the world combined. 🤮
I guess they told Larry Mullen "we'll do this gig With or Without you"
Don Felder sez "Hold my Beer"
They need/want the $. It's that simple.
Thought I heard Larry announce he was done playing due to medical reasons prior to this announcement. Never got the impression he meant just for the short term but simply done for good. If the band were to go on, it would have to without him. Not sure if they should go on without him. Without him, they are no longer U2 in my eyes. However, if you look at The Who, they have survived the passing of several band members and continue to perform for those who still want to hear their music. I'd really like to know how Larry feels about this issue. I have to believe he gave them his blessing. He also will probably continue to benefit financially from this endeavor without him. "With or Without You?" That is the question for both the band and the fans!
Admittedly, Brad Wilk absolutely NAILED IT for Black Sabbath, perhaps this new fella is quite good and won’t miss a beat.
They were probably thinking, "Who the @#$% is Rick Beato and why should we give a @#$% what he thinks?"
I agree with everything you're saying there Rick. If they have contractual obligations, they should perform a different show, maybe some sort of greatest hits thing, but delay the Achtung Baby shows until Larry is well enough to play them, or don't play THAT particular show at all.
Spinal Tap kept replacing drummers and was very successful.
U2 is the FOUR, no less. That said, no drummer needed if you’ve heard that stuff they are trying to pass off with Songs of Surrender. Not much of anything there.
If 25% of the band is missing from U2's live shows, there should be a 25% reduction in the ticket prices. Or, am I missing the point here...
Good rant.
That statement from Bono is vomit inducingly cringe and dishonest. U2 have been one of the biggest sellouts in rock history and the only reason they're doing these shows is money. To say it's "to see the fans' faces again" is pandering and surely fans are smart enough to see through his non-stop bullshit.
U2 need to disband 15 years ago. The recent reworkings are absolute dross. Embarrassing.
As a U2 fan since 1983, I'm also distraught at the notion of the band taking the stage without Larry Mullen Jr. after all this time. But in fairness to the band, back in December Larry told the Washington Post that he probably wouldn't tour with U2 in 2023 if they decided to hit the road. He mentioned needing surgery and time to recover, but his comments also suggested he may be done with touring altogether. He said, "You only do this if you’re having the best time, and not everyone is going to make it because the price is so high." I suspect that the Las Vegas gigs were lined up even in December and Larry was setting the stage for his future with U2, which is to remain a creative writing and recording member, but not touring. If that is what he wants, then there are only two options: U2 live with a different drummer, or no U2 shows ever.
I have no problem with this honestly. They've advertised they're doing a residency, that's fine; they've announced a key band member won't be there, that's a shame but it's fine. There's no dishonesty about what this is, people can choose to go or not go. Four years is a long time for any band to go without playing live, even one with as much public weight as U2. I'm sure they have Larry's blessing and would do it with him if they could.
"We need to come out and see those rich faces again" U2 only exists to take 300$ per ticket. They miss robbing their old and their new fans too.
Bono keeps 99% of the money he raises for Africa. what a fuckin turd
Huge U2 fan. I won’t go to these shows. Not a chance.
I can't get past Bono's politics; he's a World Economic Forum member, an organization that makes stunning claims such as, "you will own nothing and be happy". Meanwhile the band seems preoccupied with cashing in, it's all pretty creepy to me.
U2 are unquestioninably one of the best rock bands of the modern era, and sadly one I've only briefly seen live, a couple of songs at the opening ceremony to the 2003 Special Olympics in Croke Park(Dublin). If only Bono would shut up, he's become an embarrassment with his right-on Globalist pontificating, something that thankfully the rest of the band have had the good sense to stay away from, and concentrate on the music, for which I really respect.
The Stones replaced Charlie and it worked quite good. Charlie was very essential and iconic too. I would say give the new drummer a chance and see how the band sounds with hime before deciding if you like it. If it is a mistake, then of course you're right but at least listen to it before creating your own opinion. indeed millions of people want to sing along to the bands hits and probably many of them don't even know who the drummer is because they are not music experts, they just want to hear the songs
Sorry U2, I can probably buy a car for the asking ticket price.
You are too damn right. Just another cash grab from some used to be A-listers. Not my U2, baby.
one of the most overestimated band in the world.
I went to see them a few years back, in Brussels. Honestly I was bored. Video wall, different guitar every song, on and on. I'd have found it more interesting to just stand on a big stage and play songs. But I accept I'm a dinosaur and that's the biz. Ok.  But I don't think it's anyone's business but their own. Maybe Larry has serious health issues and they are thinking ahead. Perhaps they don't want to call it quits. I don't see the issue.
Larry Mullen Jr. had a distinct drum sound. I love the drum roll he does in "Pride(In the Name of Love)" just before Bono sings into the chorus. That is why "Unforgettable Fire" album is my favorite US album and their best work becore they went commercial with "The Joshua Tree"
Bonos narcissism is out of control. He is a paid member of the WEF who believes they should govern everyone's life which sums up perfectly his short man ego. I was a HUGE U2 fan and saw them in 8 gigs across 3 countries over 25 years and read everything i could about U2 and Bono in particular. The more i discovered about him in particular the less interested i became. I recently removed all their records and CDs and scrubbed them off my Spotify playlist. I cannot even listen to their music, now that i know about Bono. I am still a big fan of the other 3 members, and now that the great Larry has been 'replaced' my interest is below ZERO. So sad.
I have been a big u2 fan since 1984, saw them for the first time in 1987 in Gothenburg, Sweden. I think Achtung Baby is their best album. Can't believe they're going to play without Larry Mullen Jr. absolutely sick. Can't they wait for him to recover?
Life is a constant change. Why ranting about this, as opposed to being happy seeing any hearing the other three. Why should they sit at home longing for a gig as the fourth guy doesn‘t want. I am father of triplets and know how it is being in collective constellations trying to find an agreeable place to go. I choose a perspective where I can appreciate this.
Very disappointed in this rant. Many bands play with an occasional stand-in. The stand-in drummer will have a great time now since this (and other) rants. A fill-in guy? Really? No respect!
I know what you mean about the drummer's importance. I've seen the Dutch band Focus a few times in the last 20 years and, even though I've never seen them with Jan Akkerman, to me they still became Focus again when Pierre van der Linden rejoined. He wasn't the original drummer but was in the classic line-ups.
I mean, it’s been done before with huge bands. Fleetwood Mac springs to mind. Obviously for very different reasons. I do see both sides of the argument, on this one!
5:58 in other words, stay in the kitchen too long and you burn everything.
I have been a fan of U2 since ‘80. A concert with out Mullen?! Is not U2. Benn to 5 Tours. I could have waited for Mullen. Sad.
Wait a minute - does this mean I have to go to Las Vegas to see Achtung Baby performed? Son of a-! I was thrilled we got to see the Joshua Tree anniversary show in DC while I visiting since back in the day U2 never came near enough that my parents would have let me go to see the original show (I lived in NM back then - few ever came to Albuquerque). Confound it!
Wow Rick, I admire most of your work, since it is all very respectful to the musicians and informative. For some reason however, based upon NO inside knowledge at all you choose to be quite disrespectful here. AND you think we're missing "your" point? I don't. I do think you're off by being disrespectful here. Towards "some drummer" (why not being curious who he is and why he was selected to step in temporarily? That's what I would like to know) Towards Larry Mullen Jr and the other band members of U2, since you have no clue what's going on in their lives that led to this band decision and suggesting they should stop by arguing bands that hated each others guts at some point did? Why should any artist EVER be told to stop? That's up to them and no-one else. Please, I can understand you may not like their decision, as many do. Well, don't buy a ticket to the show then! Let those that are looking forward to it, and those curious to check out a new musician do and refrain from negativity. It doesn't serve any purpose, does it? The show must go on, as they say.
Don't see the issue here.... Think Guns and Roses various changes.... I like the Original line up but many people like/ prefer Matt on drums... And what about the Eagles, Metallica, AC-DC changedtheir lead singer! Iron Maiden did also.... Line up changes are common... I think you got a bee in your bonnet over something that really isn't all that big of a deal....   This just sounds like a "no post" I love your intelligent approach and the way you break down songs and deliver content  in such an interesting and unique way... However this post is none of the above!  Im sure it's just a hiccup and you'll be back posting seriously interesting content again...  All the best..
Has anyone considered possible obligations due to contract? Every band to a record company is a 'product' which needs to make revenue. Having been quiet for so long, maybe they've been put under pressure, or this new manager was, to give a sign of life and make money flow. In most instances it's about the output of recorded work (albums, singles), but revenue can of course be generated through concerts as well. Maybe U2 is doing this because they 'had to', maybe this was planned before Larry Mullen turned unable to play and the whole thing was too expensive, or too damaging for their reputation to call off. Many bands that go into their 'legacy-phase' keep on playing because of the economic incentive, not because of any creative juices.
I agree. This is ridiculous. Would they replace The Edge or Bono?? Clearly that would not be possible. Just a cash in and a very bad decision. The Stones should also hang it up now that Charlie has passed.
Saw the Achtung Baby tour the first time it came through in smaller venues. Almost didn’t get tickets even though I had Ticketmaster on speed dial and kept hitting redial at midnight when the tickets went on sale. Finally got through and only nosebleed tickets behind the stage were left, so I took them. We showed up as early as they’d let us in, several hours before the show, to watch the setup and sound check. A roadie came over to us and said, “Are these really your seats?” And we were like, “Yes”. He said, “Show me your tickets”. So we handed them over, and he goes, “Wow, these suck”. Then he ripped them up, and gave us new tickets, and said, “The band saved these for their real fans” as he handed us front row center tickets. We couldn’t believe it. They took us down and we were literally right next to the stage. The yellow jacket security guys formed a wall behind us when the concert started, so we didn’t even have to deal with a crowd pressing us into the stage. Best concert ever. We saw them again when they came through for the stadium tour, but nothing will beat that original time ever. Great band, and even better live. They really do love what they do and love their fans. 😎👍
Seems like Larry has health issues and gave his blessing for the Vegas residency. No problem with that. C'mon Rick.
Larry is not ok?
I can’t be holding on to what you got. When all U2 got it hurt.
I saw U2 in Vegas in the later 90s, it was pretty uninspired. They had technical problems galore and huddled in between songs. Their breaks were longer than the songs!
U2. I love half of their songs and despise the other half.  I saw them on their Joshua Tree tour and was hooked. Then I saw them on the Zooropa tour and was so turned off.   Side note. IMO, their halftime performance following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, was legendary.   No Larry Mullins Jr.  no U2!
They lost me  in the nineties. They are not that good. The Edge is ok, but not great. Heis good with colour and effects, I give hime that. Larry is always been the backbone, it is about the rhythm. Bono is pretentious and pompous. Adam is great. The songs are ok, a few albums are good. But do they deserve those accolades? Hell no!
Larry's back is broken Rick... I'm not a huge fan...but I'm irish so it is probably in my news more... but yeah, his back is fuckrd... they are doing this with his blessings...
I'm Good With Alex Van Halen filling in
U2 is a joke
It’s a shame I can’t sand to listen to U2. I always get told they are so me, but ever since I lived with someone who had U2 on repeat for 5 years, I can’t do it.
If Larry Mullen has a health issue and can't / doesn't feel up to performing, I don't care how many brothers or friends you have that spaz out about U2 - he should do what's best for his health and himself.
This had me laughing too. How absurd! They hardly need the money, and to play a residency in Las Vegas is beyond tasteless. It’s like putting a McDonalds in the Sistine Chapel.
U3?
I believe U2 works hard to honor their commitments and had made a commitment to play this residency opening the venue. In the meantime, Larry has health issues preventing him from playing. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, they either break their commitment, cost a lot of people money (including themselves, but let’s not forget about production staff) damaging their business reputation; or they hire a replacement with Larry’s blessing. They made the latter choice. There is precedence for this with U2…Adam was too “sick” to play a gig in Australia with his tech filling in for the night…and when Bono was injured from a bike accident Chris Martin and The Boss filled in for Bono for a world AIDS day show in Times Square. Seems like they’re making the best of a bad situation and Bono is selling it to the fans. I haven’t seen U2 since the Innocence and Experience tour and was considering catching a show simply to see and hear what it would be like without Larry in the chair. It’s a unique experience and will shed light on what makes the band tick. The risk associated with it will probably invigorate the band and make them work harder and play better than they have in quite some time.
Love U2 despite other millennial’s and younger generations shitting on them.  I’ve noticed with people at the top, have an army of yes men warping their perspective’s.
U2 was always scheduled to be the band to open this venue.  When they started building it here everyone in Vegas already heard U2 was opening it so I’m sure they already had a deal signed. From what I heard Larry doesn’t want to tour anymore so they just are doing what they have to do to play this venue that they had a deal a few years ago to open.
Larry's got 80 mil in the bank , what else does he need?
They de$perately needed to $ee their fan$ again, you know?
No John Bonham, no Led Zeppelin.  No Larry Mullen, no U2??? Sounds about right.
Yeah, I'm with you on this. This REALLY couldn't have waited another 6 months or a year? Larry doesn't want to do it right now. He's tired and obviously in pain. As a drummer I get it. It beats you up physically. This is all about BONO needing to get out in front of fans. Always my least favorite member...haha. He was always a bit eccentric, but he became a caricature of himself and just plain weird after Rattle and Hum. I'm fairly certain Larry recognizes they don't need to prove anything to anybody, they will never have to worry about money, and they're not touring a new album, so why do this?  Dude is ready to retire! He's earned it.
Well this is a downer.
U2 ARE the most boring thing ive ever heard in my life
I have "Boy" the LP record. The Edge did not wear a head covering, the distorted image on the album shows he had hair! Good disc too.  Great band, a little too taken with themselves, especially Bono. They've done some good work though so they get a pass.  Won't be going to the LV show though.
You're a HATER...GO #$@#!  YOURSELF!!!!!!!!
Larry is the most powerful part of U2's I'm not coming to a concert without him...
Really liked U2 until they decided their path to success is to help the corrupt, lying, weasel politicians that rule California spread their lies.  Their damage and impact to the world is massive. Hope their Vegas gig flops. They "still haven't found what they are looking for" because they chose to get it by helping con their fans that despicable lies are truth.   FYI: Almost zero bands find a way to stay together. Drummer probably was fed up with all the lies.
Here's my take on it..... Who cares about You Too?  Bono loves Klaus Schwab.
It's with or without you...ah  ah
``The necessity of positioning your arms and hands in front of your body to play creates the tendency for drummers to arch their backs forward and “hang” on the ligaments of the spine. This arching is one of the most common factors for lumbar spine injuries.`Come on, that man`s back is a mess.  Larry will always be part of U2.  As you say, he started the band. Come on.
It is odd that a musician like yourself wouldn't be more sensitive toward the very real wear and tear that playing live takes on musicians.
Agreed Rick. At the end of the day though it's all about the $$$. Shame on U2.
Could not agree more!
AGREED...GOOD ON YOU RICK BEATO...WHAT`S UP WITH LARRY MULLEN Jr?  Is it really repetitive motion surgery?
"Get out and see people"? No, make fans add the cost of travelling to, and staying in, Las Vegas to the cost of a ticket.
I could care less, as I dislike U2 with a passion. but I think that Larry's probably done, either health reasons or burnout. This is just a way of getting people used to the idea of a new drummer in U2.
To me they can do what they feel. All the best
YEA YEA YEA YEA YEA
Just change the name to U2.1
IN THE END RICK ITS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY JUST LIKE YOUR CHANNEL.
Easy...they already have Larry's blessing for the upcoming shows.
Bono probably needs to push some WEF agenda points out.
Rick just said the same thing I started saying recently they have not made a great album in years it's time for them to hang it up. Now they want their fans just to live in the past with this nastalga tour.smfh😠🤦
AcDc will never be the same either Rick
U2 was the rebel band -- crazy they'd ruin their image with a money grab and toss away their loyalty to Larry. Bono, look at "all that you can't leave behind"!
Sounds more like Me2 than U2! Wtf!!! Larry is U2. They don’t need any more money or fame. If Larry can’t play cos he’s not able to, then wait until he’s bloody ready. Don’t ruin your legacy for a Vegas money grab! Aaaaaaarrrrrrgh
Rick, this is not new at all. Happens all the time.  Ofcourse it would be better with all original members, but that's not an option.The purists that don't like it don't have to buy a ticket.... I believe the masses do not really care as long as it's not the frontman.
The one time I have to disagree with you Rick.  I for one can't wait to see them in Vegas.  Especially at a crazy modern venue as the MSG Sphere.
I won't go, I want U2, the original band... period!
The U2 sellout continues. First with Apple, now with the Vegas Residency    Btw, you know a band/artist is in the waning career, the fat lady is warming up phase when they announce & do the "Vega$ residency" thing.
What makes this song great - "language I: intuition" by the contortionist
Rick, looks like you have stepped on a nerve of someone in the music business.  Just watched another video and they were saying some things about you to that are strange.  I think you are a musical genius and I watch and agree with your videos.  Keep up the great work.  You are truly making a difference and especially those who appreciate good quality music.
Achtung blew me away because I thought they were going to go Springsteen or country after Rattle and Hum.
Larry not wanting to or is not physically able to are pretty much synonymous.  As for the ad, the band and/or promoter was just getting the word out there that they would be minus one member because they don’t want people complaining about it afterwards saying they didn’t know.  The band might have wanted to back out of the gig since Larry can’t make it, but are contractually obligated.  Often times everyone knows there is a lineup change in a band, but people aren’t used to seeing U2 with anyone besides those 4.  So it is significant.
I have a feeling they’ll do okay.  Not worth ranting about.
Wrap it up guys! You made 4 masterpieces in a row!  War, Unforgettable Fire, Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby.  Rattle and Hum was a misstep in my opinion aside from All I Want Is You…brilliant!
Beato beats U2 on U2be 😅
If Def Leppard can wait for Rick, U2 can wait for Larry...
I don't like U2 because they are in world economic Forum
🎯
Oh hello.  I am Irish. Ok. I saw U2 in Belfast. 2019? £65. I left after 15 minutes. This is not the bsnd (boy October) I grew up with
Kiss has proven there is still money to be made regardless of the members. I don’t like it, but hey some suckers do. More power to U2, I’ll keep my money.
I'm a U2 fan and went to their concert but the last album i bought was htdaab. I don't know if Vegas will pay off🤷‍♀️
0:53 hehe, Buddy Rich
Larry is too sick to play right now.  He'll be back once he's able to be back. They're not making a new album without him. I feel that would be a mistake.  Thus doesn't feel like a big deal to me.
Maybe Larry's gone fishing.
Rick how dare you voice your opinion on your own channel!
Well, it's just temporary, and events like this are being planned way early. I bet U2 had every intention to play with their original drummer. Unfortunately, that didn't seem to work out  this time. But I think 'this or some kid' might not do justice to him. U2 wouldn't pick just 'some kid' to replace Larry. I feel that  Bram deserves a fair chance. For him, this is a dream come through. Just let him play and support him instead. Next time, hopefully, Larry will be back.I understand the disappointment, but give the new drummer some credit. At least the benefit of the doubt.
At nearly 69, so many members have passed from the bands that I grew up with and yet these bands are still touring as the "original" band just because a "rodey" who toured with the band back in the day is still with them. Yes, I'm being more than facetious but I so identified with your video.
Larry will get a hefty deposit for his "blessing", don't worry. The perfect, 100% pure "Rock Star" doesn't exist. It's called music business for a reason. There's the Rock 'n Roll Fantasy camp and stuff like that for those who (sigh) "don't want to stop believing".
" Apparently,  they got some fill in guy" Wow, bet he feels proud about his new gig! But seriously folks, who is the real winner here? Larry Mullen Jr. Why? Because after the Apple  iTunes debacle of Song of Innocence why take on another huge  business venture that could possibly backfire and tarnish your bands reputation even further. Just look up the specs of what  the $2.18 billion MSG Sphere will  offer as a premiere venue. Here is an excerpt  " The MSG Sphere will be equipped with 19,000 by 13,500 resolution LED screens which will spread across the interior of the venue.The wraparound screen will measure 160,000 sq ft (15,000 m2). It will be the largest and highest-resolution LED screen in the world."  It screams Zoo TV. It makes sense on paper and U2 has the pedigree to pull in a crowd, but it ain't the 90's. It sure as hell better be worth every dime  every night we have to pay to see it.  Some of those late 80's early  90's alt rock kids are now crazy Karens who will be real tough customers if you they don't get what is expected of this spectacle. It is already missing a key member of the group and inflations is hitting us hard. If there is a hint of lip synching, backing tracks or tele prompters there will be hell to pay. The ticket prices, the hotel, gas, food and drink etc sounds to be real $$$. Good luck to them, but Achtung Babies!
The fans will let U2 know whether they're okay with the substitution.  Wishing Larry Mullen Jr a speedy recovery. Great drummer.
They’ve been (creatively) bankrupt for years………MONEY, MONEY, MONEY
the Sphere opening is a huge deal. Do NOT underestimate that.  They are getting PAID is secondary.
I hate to say it, but I think they feel like they can get away with playing without Larry precisely because it’s Vegas. I don’t think they would try to mount a full tour without him. Then again, I could be wrong. The idea they would do this residency without him would’ve been unthinkable a few days ago.
I'm not sure why Rick thinks that a band that includes tax-dodging money-grubbing hypocrite Bono is in any way surprising. There's a reason why Bono is so disliked in Ireland.
What about Jimmy Nicol?
You're not that stupid, @Rick Beato.  Bet, just bet, that the Sphere people paid for that ad.  It's sad without Larry but so many bands have replacements.  Larry is probably going to be out of commission for at least a year.
My first U2 show was at my college, 4th date on the WAR Tour.   Last Show was 2017 for the Joshua Tree 30th Anniversary.   Saw at least one show on every tour in between them except the 360 tour.  No interest in seeing the band without Larry Mullen Jr.  Fame and Celebrity is a funny life.  Retirement would be the honorable thing to do at this point.  They having nothing left to prove, and no new ground to break.
Fully agree with you on this... Was and still am a huge fan of their earlier work until Achtung Baby.  You barely touched the subject of greed as the main motivator for this sad decision...  So I'll just go ahead and say that for all the value signaling the band (esp. Bono) has done over the years, now is at last the time for them to walk their talk. And they should.
I think Mullen's going to quit. He looks tired of the whole thing in every photo shoot.
It is my belief that big-time bands like U2 don't become big-time unless they become yes-men. At some point, they become beholden to very powerful people and give up a lot of autonomy. This is why you see certain bands or celebrities embracing things like political extremism and hanging around long beyond their shelf life. U2 can still play - they were great last I saw them in 2017 - but playing a Vegas residency and without their founder tells me they don't have much of a choice.
An overzealous approach to brotherly bandness has always been a big part of their charm has a group. This is evidenced even in the undertones of the iTunes debacle. I think we’re all fine with this, as long as Larry is involved. Guys, wait for Larry.
The name U2 came from the name of the Irish Unemployment form. Hmmm...foreshadowing? LOL, I watch bands all the time with original missing. Stones went out without Bill Wyman the Charlie (RIP)
Simple. They need to generate the money to pay their staff. They employ hundreds. Same reason a lot of bands still do tours. While artistically this sucks, it's just business. They need to generate the funding to keep the business going at the scale they developed with that dedicated staff.
They haven't made even a half decent record since 1993 and since 2000 have basically been releasing the same record over and over . Time to quit lads it's not like you need the money and you ran out of inspiration years ago
Rick, easy on the fanboy moves 😅
Surely its still not about the money?
Sure it would be better with Larry Mullen Jr. but , I would go see them regardless. Would it be better if Zeppelin didn't do the O2 concert with Jason ?  Sometimes you don't always get what you want. Music is their passion and Im sure they're driven to carry on. Look at David Crosby, pretty much toured and made new music  up to like the last year of his life.
U2 has always sucked. Call this divine intervention.
They will be just fine without Larry. This is better than not playing at all.
My first thought upon watching this was, "only a band like U2 would do such a thing (Super Bowl ad), and only a band like U2 would get away with it." Because in most people's minds they are the biggest most grandiose band in existence to the verge of pomposity.   That's not to say I don't love them. Just that if you told me a band was going to make this kind of announcement in advertisement during a major sporting event, in my mind it couldn't be anyone else.
Would you care to comment about ACDC hiring Axel Rose in a wheelchair for that ridiculous tour a few years ago?
😆
What about the Stones after Charlie Watts passing?!?
U2 should have broken up after Zooropa. They just stopped pushing creatively in a unique way.
I'm still looking forward to this.  My sons (ages 19 & 14) can't wait to see this show.
The lighting and look of your videos reminds me of old school film.Just awesome Rick.
Absolutely correct.  R.E.M. They did it right. I miss them, but time waits for no one.
Not a fan.
Saw them first on an interview on “The New Music” in Canada back pre Much Music/pre-MTV days of the late 70’s and been a huge fan ever since October, (only got Boy later in Canada) and was completely hooked by the time Live Under a Blood Red Sky was released! Had that album on vinyl! I can’t imagine Larry not playing with them. Get well soon Larry and see you on the road soon we hope!
I think it's alright mate. I'm sure they have discussed this with Larry.
This is hilarious, Rick. I'm 34 and started listening to them in earnest just a few years ago. I wouldn't say Achtung Baby is my favorite record, but I grew up with some seriously iconic songs off of that album, and I definitely do still choose to put it on occasionally. I became a big fan after (but not because of) the release of Songs of Experience, but I still went back and really dug into their old material. I think that it's a mistake to pretend that new fans can't have favorites from so long ago. In fact, my favorite is The Joshua Tree, which was released BEFORE Achtung Baby and the year before I was born.  However, I do agree that while Larry Mullen Jr. is alive and kicking and part of the band, they need to not play shows without him. That feels wrong.   But posting a whole rant about it? Ehhhhh... not sure. Is the ad a little weird? Sure. Is the BAND a little weird? Oh, yeah, buddy, that's why we love them. So yeah, it's weird, but it's not going to make me angry. Makes me wonder if maybe you need me to bring you a stick to shake while you yell at kids to get off your lawn ;)  Also I did think Songs of Innocence was an incredibly good album, but I think I pretty much stand alone, there.
I am a longtime U2 fan, back to early 80's in War/Unforgettable Fire era.  What I think we may be missing here is U2 doing something we are not expecting, as they are about pushing boundaries, especially in their live shows.  They are a live band, in that their songs sound better live, compared to their studio counterparts - They refine the songs on the road - Bad, Streets, New Years Day etc.  The Sphere is a multimedia exeprience, including smells from what I have read, and the Edge recently said they are going to take advantage of the innovation and push the boundaries.  I understand Larry Mullen Jr has been injured for a long time and during Covid it came to light just how bad he is, so he said he is not playing in 2023 as he needs to heal up.  With that being said, I am not sure they will have a live drummer to replace him, as they probably will use some tech to have his part played(even by him in video), kind of like a further extention of what they did on the Experience tour where they played along with video parts too.  Whatever the case, I am sure it is going to push boundaries and expectations.
Nobody cares about the bass or drummer. Basically, U2 is Bono and the Edge. Like Led Zep is Page and Plant. The Who is Roger and Pete, although Entwistles virtuosity really stood out. But you know what I mean. Nobody cared when Kiss replaced their drummer.
It’s like watching an elephant do the backstroke in a bikini, when it should be wild and free running through the Tundra Where’s the new music? Why go backwards? Why play without one member? If the  lead singer or guitar player couldn’t make the show would they be so easily replaced? In Vegas no less lol maybe it’s time for white jumpsuit and sequins. Maybe American politicians will be there! U2 have managed themselves into Kmart, apple and now Vegas. 🎉 they may have become their own tribute band! They seem to delight in the circus of it all.
You say it Rick!
Something is telling me Larry Mullan wanted nothing to do with this. I don't think he wants to play a residency or be associated with it. Not only that, but he doesn't seem to have been a part of this reworked songs of surrender which sounds absolutely terrible by the way. Maybe he just can't get on board with what the band are trying to do and the direction they are going in. Maybe he has had enough of it all. Who knows. I will say this, if songs of surrender is the level that the band are at presently then it is time to give it up. And I wouldn't blame Larry for wanting out.
I've been a hater of U2 since 1987.  I'm a lifelong non-fan.
Agree 100%, as I usually do with Rick. I'm currently a Las Vegas resident and onetime musician here, and could write a book about what I think. Just hard to figure out. Larry, not just his drum parts, is what makes this band what it is (or was). And then Bono shows up on TV with Jill Biden last week? Is he that desperate for affirmation or what? How much more $$ and attention does he need? They will sell out though, not just because it's U2, but because people come to Vegas for one reason, to be entertained, and they usually aren't particular about who the entertainer is. They're here to do the opposite of the things Jesus says, the very things Bono preaches about. I'm sad about the whole thing I must say.
I agree. I’m also going on line to delete that monumental blunder the dumped on my apple products. Actually since they really didn’t come up with anything worth listening to and dumped on that pathetic noise on my apple products I was done with them. Everything after Achtung Baby for me sucked, but Joshua Tree, Rattle and Hum DVD and of course the off the charts Achtung Baby have been listened to all the time. U2 who cares. They should bow out gracefully……
Agree with you 100% First U2 show was the Unforgettable Fire.
This thing has "contractual obligation" written all over it. Probably something U2 signed up for in 2019 or 2020 and took the payday. They HAVE to play on without Larry, or else they'll get sued/lose money.
Led Zep did it right. Lost a band mate: ended the band
Achtung Baby was my favorite U2 album.
i used to love U2 for years...their best albums, WAR,UNFORGETTABLE FIRE,JOSHUA TREE,ACTUNG BABY until i read Bono's book....raising money for the sick,poor and aids all good but now he's greedy for his band(you'll never be the rolling stonesBono)  ..get over yourself you pompous greedy fuck....i agree Rick 100%
Who are they going to use?
From the Spotify image of “One”:  “…I am eventually reminded that I am one quarter of an artist without Edge Adam and Larry”
If it's ok with Larry, why should anyone else have a problem with it?
U2/YouTube ....?@ 3.40 in ....
You know, they could've announced a hologram residency instead 🤷‍♂️
Ageed!! Saw them at Wembley Stadium on the Pop Mart tour, back in the days before seating, right at the front , totally epic show,  but I'd feel let down not seeing the OG lineup, especially performing one of their very best albums.
U2 have been my favorite band since seeing them on the first ‘Boy’ tour way back in 1981. I’ve seen them nine times but I really think they should’ve waited until Larry was healed up even if it took a year till they did this…just because that’s what you do with a close knit band of four, like they are. I doubt that money is too tight that they couldn’t wait another year but I still love the band and will always continue to, but as one of the biggest fans, I truly wish they would’ve waited for Larry.
Larry seemed to change his style of drumming over time look at him at Live Aid compared to recent tours - completely different player.
I fear that this isn't as much a misstep as is the Songs of Surrender compilation.  From what I've heard so far: One, Pride, With or without you and Beautiful day....  It's almost unlistenable - I'm shocked by how drab and tired it sounds. 😫😳😫
An official rant.  I saw U2 in Chicago and would love to go again. I discovered them while in a record store in 1982
Do a video on Tom Bukovac…
Once you reach those altitudes you have to be very thankful to get some honest feedback from your entourage, I guess! Same in other branches (George Lucas, Elon Musk, ...)
After so many years and such a big following …. Why advertise ? Just seems inappropriate I guess is the phrase but add the fact that Larry isn’t playing and the reason that “they need to connect” with their audience again ??? Really ??? Strange move u2 strange indeed.
I felt kind of like this when i heard that Jane's Addiction is touring without Dave Navarro, who they had never played a show without since he joined the band. They even got their original bassist Eric Avery back and then go on tour with the guitarist from QOTSA, who did a great job honestly, but still... Now they're even talking about making the next album without Navarro and i've just about had it.
I agree with almost all of your points- this makes NO sense. The only thing I don't totally agree with is "new U2 fans don't want Achtung Baby." I was born in 1999, I grew up on U2 through my dad (whose fav album is Joshua Tree) and Achtung Baby is my single favorite record of all time. I was ecstatic to hear that they were doing a run of shows for this album, right up until I heard about Larry...
I'm sure this isn't the case with Larry. but I remember waking up one day after playing drums for 35 years and thinking " I don't want to do this anymore"
Rick, I get where you're coming from and as a long time U2 fan I agree that they don't need the money to do this string of appearances in Vegas.  How do we know it wasn't just Larry's decision to back out and he left the other guys high and dry? I'm so sick of bands "calling in sick" to cash in on their tour insurance that I find it refreshing that U2 is moving forward, ahem, With Or Without Larry on this one.  As for the show being "Achtung Baby" - I'm not really into that album.  I think I'd prefer to see U2 recreating the Joshua Tree tour, which was the first concert I ever attended.  Do we know if this "Achtung Baby" residency isn't part of a bigger 2 or 3 residency deal where U2's final farewell will culminate with a Joshua Tree Tour experience? Maybe the whole package was too big to screw up because of one member's injury.
Bono Is may next door neighbor , I'll ask him when I see him today or maybe tomorrow
As much as I would like to attend one of these shows. I can't see myself going with no Larry on the bill. I will cut them some slack as this is a one off and the contracts were probably signed long ago, but it's not for me.
Has anyone seen Bono’s highly successful Surrender tour, without the whole band? There will be an appreciative audience in Vegas, I predict. They are artists who forge their way in their own way and new audiences will appreciate what they get there.
Most of best top 5000 drummers  could replace Mullen , in playing , but U2 is U2 with LM
Mullen replaced by a Dutch drummer
I thought they were a "Democratic" band meaning they do everything equally. For example, they all have the same rights and receive the same royalties from their songs. This seems like it would mess that up a bit.
We are getting the point, Rick. I’m merely defending the replacement drummer. For him, it will be a great once in a lifetime experience.
The replacement drummer is a Dutch guy so I am happy. Marcel, from the Netherlands.
the honest truth is the majority of the $$ paying crowd does not care who is playing drums. I do not not subscribe to this belief but it is legit unfortunately.
The Backstreet Boys did a residence in Vegas, why can't u2? Theyve shown throughout pretty much the last 35+ years they're a band driven by fame and fortune. Are you upset the Stones are still touring? I get it, U2 are antithema to their anti political message, but they're one of the biggest acts ever. Paul McCartney sounds like garbage people dont criticize him for still doing what he loves. Your heart is in tbe right place, your brain isn't. U2 will sell out every show.
Love U2 of the '80s (including "Rattle and Hum"), but I distinctly remember buying "Achtung, Baby" and HATING it, like wtf?!? Then Nirvana and Pearl Jam hit, and I was kinda over U2. To see so much love for their 1991 album (and abrupt pivot) is surprising, but then I'm not a musician like Rick and maybe a lot of these commenters.
It's a shame that Larry won't be playing, but I think it's important to keep in mind that this is a Las Vegas residency where they'll be performing songs from "Achtung Baby." Now, if they'd announced that they were working a *new album* without Larry--for me, *THAT* would be the forbidden line, not to be crossed. We'll have to wait and see what the future holds...
Rick, The Rolling Stones did the same thing in 2021 didn’t they?
U2 fired Paul McGuinness for various reasons but primarily because Larry hates him. Then Larry gave out even worse about Guy Oseary. Bono and Larry don’t get on and sadly the band are threading water and running their legacy. Such a shame for them.
Larry jab jab ?
He's not ONLY the drummer but the Founder of the band
I love U2 and not because of BONO.. but because of Larry and the Edge. He's such an interesting drummer. I really liked the sounds they  got from the guitar and the drums. Good Video Rick and I agree 100%
I think the more troubling part is the residency in Vegas.  But, yeah, it's not really U2 without Larry. Have they become a nostalgia a act?
I agree; I'm not sure I want to go see U2 without Larry Mullen Jr. ( a band who I've been regularly seeing for most of my life, being 60 and having first seen them at a little place called Woolsey Hall in New Haven, part of Yale University in 1983...)
One down 3 to go.
Rick, love your work and your fond support of real singers. Why do you use AI nonsense for your artwork in that case?
Would you go see Tool without Danny Carey? Sure, someone else could do it. But regardless of his medical issues and he has had some significant surgeries, they wait for him to recover. He’s in his 60’s as well.
U2’s music has always been commercial pop garbage to me. That said, I came up in the 90s when bands like Pearl Jam and TOOL were what it was really about. I see U2 as like an original Coldplay.
Achtung Baby was the album that made me change from the hardest of die hard fans to one who stopped caring about new U2 music. Never really cared for anything after Rattle and Hum.
It was actually each user who made it possible for the U2 album to appear on their devices. U2 released the album for free and Apple did this by automatically making it “owned” by everyone who had an iTunes account. If a user had their settings for “automatically download owned songs” turned on got the album downloaded.
Tell that to the Rolling Stones !
The thing is that artists have an expiration date, which is hard to accept for the artists themselves and the fans. These guys are done, and they know it, so they want to get paid, and the greedy don't want to wait. Maybe Larry is the only artist remaining in the band, the rest of U2 are businessmen.
"Big Money" by Rush said it all👍👌💯 🤠
Oh come on it is a one off performance with one member being replaced but because it is U2 people decide to have a go mainly based of an underlying jealousy because they have been at the top for decades with live performances and a back catalogue that goes far beyond what any other band can reach, other famous bands continued with original members missing yet they don't receive the same hate why is that? I include Queen, ACDC, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, Iron Maiden, Van Halen, Genesis to name but a few yet U2 are doing it as a one off and you have a go, get off your moral high horse and celebrate these once in a generation musical legends instead.
Joshua Tree far Superior to Achtung Baby...  I'd actually love to see that full album played live.  "With or Without" Larry.    Better with him though
Something else I am wondering is whether doing a residency in Las Vegas is indeed the best response to the desire of fans from all over the world, as those shown in the promo video, to see the band live…
Regarding the Apple thing. It isn't as easy as just not listening to it. My wife has an iPhone, and those tracks are always prioritzed when the phone connects to our car Blutooth, so it is Autoplayed when we start the car, we can't stop it fast enough and go to Spotify.....
Agree, Rick.
Sorry Rick. Next man up. If Larry is medically a no go, then next man up! It’s show biz. He’s still in the band for new music.
U are right, Rick
Im sorry but U2 hasnt done ANYTHING ive liked since unforgettable fire and i LOVED U2.  Dave please throw away all the effects
Kansas has been recording with  new players from Drastic Measures through Absence of Presence (1982 through 2019) and are still performing wonderfully today. Although I will admit that Kansas with Kerry Livgren playing lead guitar & keyboards along with composing, orchestrating, and writing lyrics in the 70s (1974 - 1882) made the greatest version of Kansas.
Dear Rick,  Interesting coincidence.  A little over a week ago I re-watched your clip about "Drowning Man", at the beginning of which you mention the many people who hate U2.  For some reason I felt compelled to write several paragraphs in the comments about why even as a listener I could see the haters' points of view.   Your rant here reflects much of my exasperation.   For a group that largely defined 80's post-punk and 90's post-grunge, catapulting from college-radio underground to the top of the world, they've done some embarrassing and remarkably insecure things.  I can empathize with a man who's in pain, but that seems beside the point: it's this decision by U2 as a group that prompts this discussion.
The real issue is a Vegas residency…. A facsimile of U2 would be appropriate.  This just seems like a cash grab. Little to do with the fans.
It’d be great if Dave Grohl play the drums for this gig and not just a John Doe.
100% agree.  U2 is those 4 guys.  I saw them in 88 on the Love Come to Town tour with BB King in Australia post Rattle & Hum (that album was no miss.. its up there with the best albums) and in 06 on the Pop Mart Tour (Rage against the Machine supporting)  in San Diego (just happened to be in town and there was still tickets (album was a bust but that tour was unbelievable, as good as Achtung Baby and Zoo TV tours).  Maybe the best 2 concerts I've even seen.  I'm not sure I see them again if tickets were cheap with a fill in ringer drummer... don't know.. have to think about it.
4:30 damn I forgot how many good albums they made. That said, I did see floyd without Waters which seemed unbelievable, and it was still marvelous, and Waters was my favorite band member through the 80s.
The MSG Sphere will most likely be the premier concert venue in LV. I drive by the construction site periodically and it is mind-blowing with its design and technology capabilities. I think this might be more about U2 wanting to be the first band to christen this new venue, and perhaps MSG was ready to book their plan B band but Bono et al decided they wanted to be the first band.
Am huge u2 fan i went saw them live in new zealand on joshua tree tour then love town then again u2 tv then last tour .after for me dispointment last well 3 albums i cant remember one song of last two .well 30 seconds into last show i was like all dobt vanished.omg this band best just wow.but this them playing best album .i wondered how larry mullan jnr felt playing sorry dull lifeless boring music.last one slightly better .but lyrics had no bono vocal ticks or his style .i liked when did intresting film scores or do side projects .come back feel u2 buzz where has it gone.i understand np band stays great creative new ideas run out .to everone .keep playing live but please stop .putting out average records .its embarrsing .new one recording old songs why.why .u2 are about passion speaking out .which best thing about them .i understand bono wanting express things learnt about his life its cool .and can relate but music to me about beat rythm .sure atmosphric allways been nice part that eno danniel lynios .where my band gone i miss them .feel this end with larry surley this is him had enough waiting for rock n roll .rhcp proven u can regain the love of being happy and a force again .i hope am wrong i really do.
It wasn’t supposed to end like this. Fat Elvis U2.  Hard pass.
My brother and I saw U2 once, on the Unforgettable Fire tour, it was an enjoyable show.
Agreed 100%.  But if they'd been considering doing an interview with you before this…I wouldn't hold your breath. LOL  In all seriousness, Larry must be really sick. I hope he gets better.  Rock has lost many amazing drummers lately.
U2 blows anyway lol should of stopped 43 years ago
or maybe it's better interpreted this way: Try having your chest sawed open for bypass surgery, and then when you realize you're still alive, asking yourself "Ah heck, let's just put off touring for another year, after it's already been 4 years since you last played in front of thousands of fans.....the sense of immediacy fills your arteries I'd imagine.
Pls do something about Lionel richie.  Love will conquer all song.  I don't understand how much music can fit into a single stereo track...lol!
Mr. Beato, in my humble opinion, (and Im just one fan) but during the pandemic and over the past 4 years, I've wondered about the mental health of Bono and how not performing has affected him emotionally. If we think about what's he has been telling us thru his Shure Microphone on stage and in albums, that for example Rock & Roll has saved his life, the he's blown away by U2 audiences every night he gets on stage, and for someone who pours his soul out to hundreds of thousands, maybe just maybe he's having a difficult time coping without the approval of cheering fans. So much so, that he got Larry's blessing to pack up the U2 mantle and hit the road with Krezip's drummer. Try to put yourself in Bono's shoes. Larry's back needs surgical repair. Bono's ego needs immediate repair that can only be repaired by going on tour. Just my opinion. Thank you for your time.
I was at that the show at the Vet in '92 too. Great show.
I think Rick missed the point of what a residency means for a band. Especially if one of the band members is ill. Stability. And then there is the amazing breakthrough venue that will begin the post movie theater, post stadium concert experience. MSG Sphere is 20,000 people enjoying a merge of VR and personalized sound. U2 is happy to be the first to present this new theater experience that hopefully duplicates in other large markets. Seriously…$500 for bad seats is the current norm. Vs a venue where every seat has a perfect view with perfect sound.  Lastly it was Apple fault with the Itunes since the song automatically came on every time bluetooth was activated. Can you blame U2 managers with trusting Apple to do technology right. Of course not.
They’ll probably get backing singers along with a keyboard player. It’s all about the money now. Their not interested in releasing new music. Probably don’t have the confidence. Very sad.
Very easy if you were to go up to 100 people in a Las Vegas casino and ask them Do You like U2? Most would say Yes I'd imagine. Then ask the same person name a member of U2 and pretty much every single person who answered Yes would say Bono. Then you would get The Edge in 2nd place by a huge margin. After that unless you really like U2 the answers to naming the other 2 guys Clayton and Mullen to the average music fan is going to be Ummm don't know the other 2 guys or Hmmm I have no clue but I know the singer is Bono. Then unless you  are a diehard huge U2 fan who knows the band's history or has a bunch of general music knowledge if you ask them whether they would skip the show because Larry Mullen is not playing 99 percent minus Rick Beato the 1 percent would say hell No I'm going to the show. With that said I like Larry Mullen. I think he is a huge part of the band and a super underrated drummer that deserves much more credit. With that said I also know he is not a persona or "Rockstar". Not based on talent but based on being recognized walking down the street he is not a Tommy Lee or Travis Barker or Lars Ulrich where he is a super well known personality of the band to everyday average music fans. So regardless of what reasons they give with a ton of money on the table and a ton of sold out shows on the table I can safely say as much as I do like him the Show can go on without Larry Mullen. I wish people with the music background knowledge and dedication like Rick Beato were the 99 percenters and not the 1 percenters unfortunately it's the other way around so the show goes on as does the money train minus Larry Mullen for awhile.
If you re a musician you understand his point , that band relies so much on each of its part , remove one and sound nothing lie  it . thats the problem
I wasn't sure how I felt until I read one of the comments in this thread that pointed out that the concerts are an advertisement for the venue, which makes the Super Bowl ad, the firmness of the dates despite Larry's absence, and all the rest make sense. Not that there's not more than a whiff of tackiness. I came to this video expecting to get defensive, but I was disarmed by Rick's self-disclosure as a fan. U2's ambition, and their missteps along the way, are inextricable from who they are as a band. I love them, have for years, but I can't fault any one their ambivalence, or even hatred. It's like being in love with someone with "issues;" The highs are high, but Bono can be ... a lot.
When Eno got involved, I lost interest.
Love U2, fan since late 70s, drummer myself....but Rick...gotta disagree. The Who, Queen, Stones.....they all have done the same thing. Sure, it's not the same, but like you say - fans will vote with ticket sales.
Well, I saw the Who with Simon Phillips way back when and he totally kicked ass 🤠
Man I remember when I was 15 in 1987, going to the New Jersey Meadowlands Brendan Byrne arena by myself (no one wanted to go) and buying a good seat off a scalper for 17 bucks with a stripped down stage set!  Times have certainly changed way too much!
"War" var det første plata jeg kjøpte og for meg vil "War" alltid være U2's beste plate.
Kinda low in my opinion
Vegas is weird.  If anything should ever be considered "contrived" for money, it's Vegas.  Everything is designed to get you, as you're mildly drunk, to say "yeah, I LOVE that band" and buy expensive tickets because "we're on vacation!"  This is just another example of that.
U-who?
Geez, Rick. I can image what you think of today's version of the Beach Boys. ))
I keep thinking you're saying "YouTube"
I've never seen U2 live, and I won't unless all the original members are there.
Was this actually an argument in good faith? U2 is a band, yes, but also a machine. Possibly hundreds of people are responsible for putting on their shows either through design, construction, testing, etc. The venue probably sunk substantial costs dedicating their state-of-the-art stage to U2's slot. It could be that, due to the upfront costs, they had no choice but to put on the show to recoup their substantial investment. This is the inevitable consequence of having amazing stage experiences--the show must go on.  It's going to be okay for people to enjoy themselves at the show even if it's not Larry. There's no way this drummer will suck. It's rock and roll. Give him a chance. Let's not adopt the absurd pretention of classical music and bitch about someone's playing before you even hear it.  The disappointing thing is that I think you know this, Rick, and went for the clickbait. Well you got me!
As Frank Zappa said on his 1967 album, "We're only in it for the money".
Yes I was surprised they went ahead without Larry but I think the sequence of events were saying yes first and the contract with MSG building the Sphere went ahead then the health issue with Larry came up and they might have gotten sued. Bono the salesman just plays the diplomat. He out of all of us is closer to Larry from childhood so I don’t think we should be lecturing him about his own mate.
It all boils down to money.  Not that they need more lol.
Agreed!
Achtung Maybe.
Been a U2 fan since my first exposure as a 13 y.o. Back in ‘81.  Achtung Baby is a masterpiece.  They could have ended it all there and they’d still be considered one of the greatest rock bands ever.   Bono turned my stomach last year with his self aggrandizing comment about how he can’t stand listening to his singing on all of those great recordings and wonders how anyone would.  I guess we’re all suckers, Bono.  …and was that him in the gallery at the State of the Union address last week?  Good Lord.
Fan since 1984. I couldn’t agree more.
From what I read Larry was fine with it and they want to be the opening act at the sphere. Also they haven't toured since 2019 and they  love playing live so you really can't blame them.
Two corrections:  U2 are 47 years old.  And the ultimate drums record is War, arguably the greatest album BECAUSE of the drums.
Spot on... seems like a sell out... they really couldn't wait for him to be able to play with them?? There's got to be more to this, my guess is that Larry is done, doesn't want to do it anymore
I doubt there’s enough room in Las Vegas for Bono’s ego.
Yeah I remember that free itunes album that noboday asked for!  Outside of their early stuff I stopped following shortly after Joshua Tree, mainly because I think it got over played. Unrelated, but I noticed a Korg Nautilus in the foreground, pretty slick. I own a pair of Kronos and was tempted but am staying on the old stuff for a while.
MONEY!!!!   IS THE ROOT OF ALL------!!
Y’a that iTunes thing really irritated me sadly I think it’s over for them. October was beautiful, Unforgettable Fire mesmerizing and Joshua Tree sublime
More like, "Dear Rick, This Video Is Pointless". U2 does whatever it freaking wants. It's not for us to decide.
Must be taxes.
To me, U2's been dead since 2000  with _ATTTYCLB_ (my God, even the acronym is a loooong title), but apparently, no one has told them. Great band until that record. Yeah yeah yeah... some good singles, but not one great album. U2 lost their way. Sadly.
I love Rick but this video is strange. Not everyone's health holds up. Sometimes people develop health issues. It's a sad fact of life. Phil Collins isn't the same drummer he used to be. Syd Barrett developed mental issues. Do other band members need to give up music because of this?  Bruce Springsteen should've retired after Danny and Clarence died?
Saw them a few years ago at the Rose Bowl. There’s only one guy that plays U2 like Larry Mullen Jr. How are you going to have LMJ not playing Sunday Bloody Sunday?!
"Until the End of the World" is the only song they every wrote. All the other stuff is noise.
I discovered U2 in earnest in 1987. Yes, I knew the dogs from War, and Unforgettable Fire, but Joshua Tree is the album all of my friends were listening to in 7th grade. For me, that “holy cow” moment for me was when Achtung Baby came out. I got it on release day. I liked Zooropa, I even followed them through their odd Passengers and Pop/PopMart era. I thoroughly enjoyed their return to roots with All You Can’t Leave Behind. And I even liked Atomic Bomb. But, even this mega U2 fan realized that Bomb was the last “good” U2 album to be released. No Line On the Horizon sucked. I couldn’t find even a single song I liked or could relate to or was moved by. This is something I thought impossible from U2. And yet…it happened. I gave them another chance with Songs of Innocence. Again, not a single song I liked. That was it for me. I am a completist - and yet I could not bring myself to purchase Songs of Experience. The magic was gone. As I understand it, Edge thought it would be fun to release an album this March which is a re-hash of old songs. They can’t even write new songs anymore. They’re creatively bankrupt. This Vegas show is further evidence. Sad. I choose to remember them in their prime: as The Fly & Company, complete with Fly glasses.
spot on Rick
I remember in 93 their win on the Grammys.i was so proud. I would think Larry gave his blessing.. but at heart I will not, never, see them live if it isn't all 4 of them. I agree with every word you said. I think they have been misdirected for many years since Paul retired. They are still my #1. But I won't see them if they aren't all together, doesn't and wouldn't feel right. Achtung is u second fave album never to unforgettable fire.
You are 100% correct. This wreaks of corporatism, something they have always stood against. Also, I caught The Joshua Tree tribute tour in 2017 thinking that was the last tour. And, that should have been it, save 1 offs here and there. Part of the deal was telling your friends they missed it and they should of been there for the last tour, thinking that was the last time only to See U2 come out again in 2019. I feel jipped and I paid through the nose to buy those tickets in 2017!!! Why did I do that if they were just going to keep coming around? It is the law of diminishing returns here on display front and center. They went out on top and this can only hurt them and their legacy.  With that said, I am a longtime fan from the start of U2(MTV era) and this was one of a very very few bands that used to make the hair stand on my arms when I would hear one of their songs, especially a live version. Their music was amazing. Please guys, dont let your egos tarnish it, bow out gracefully.
I completly agree with you, Rick!!! It Just makes no Sense at ALL!!!
I use U2 m7sic to scare rats and raccoons in the garden at night. Works like a charm.
I thought we were going to get some information about the fill in drummer. Maybe he's even better than the real thing.
I don’t like U2.
That's what U2 gets for being a blocker!
From what I heard the replacement drummer is a good drummer, but yeah it's not Larry. Reminds me a bit of Genesis continuing without Phil (however that was a real change), Ray did a good job, but still no success. Also the Beatles used a replacement (Jimmy) to stand in for Ringo some times.
I will say that when Bill Berry left R.E.M. it somehow seemed wrong for them to continue without their original drummer, and they ultimately did a string of fairly solid and revitalized records.  But I'll also say that I appreciate that R.E.M. knew when to quit, and maybe U2 can't figure out that it might be time.
That was spot on. For some people doing shows is like being on heroin ... That's all that is. Another dopamin hit. They where doing it for more than 40 years ...
Favorite band (against my metal will, ha) since 1996. I'm all about celebrating Achtung Baby, which I consider one of their best (along with JT), and moreover, a GOAT contender. Thing is, they did a huge JT tour in 2017 for the 30th, and talked about doing this with AB, but COVID screwed touring for 2021. But 2023 still overlaps with the ZooTV tour, so I get them wanting to do it, especially with this new venue opening in Vegas this year.   All that said, not having Larry is... troubling. Like Rick said, it's always been these four since 1976, and that's an amazing legacy to have. If Larry can't play, well... an argument could be made that maybe they shouldn't. At least until if and when he can again.
So do you think the same thing about Motley Crue having John 5 instead of Mick Mars?!
I saw them in 1983 with The Alarm opening up at the LA Sports Arena
It sounds like the real story can only be gotten from Larry Mullen. Call him up.
Reminder: Chris Martin replaced Bono for a one-off TV performance after Bono’s bicycle accident. My understanding was that they’d committed to the gig and the show must go on.
So, since Larry is having surgery for neck, elbow, and knee issues, the band shouldn’t be able to perform? If he’s signed off on it, why not?
this is not an ordinary gig - The " Sphere" is reportedly a next level audio and visual experience - a place that sounds fitting for U2 and Achtung Baby, and U2 are opening it.  I dont think this new venue could wait around for Larry Mullen to recover from his surgery.  Larry has given his blessing for this- he is a no nonsense guy after all, and his no nonsense approach is one of the big reasons U2 have lasted so long
U2 without LM Jr. Is not U2.
I think their manager made them sign a contract for Las Vegas before they knew Larry needed surgery and they couldn't cancel or it would cost them a lot of money. And management in Las Vegas can be very persuasive... Just a thought. And this 'fill in guy' happens to be an excellent drummer so he doesn't deserve to be called the 'fill in guy'. It has a sound of inferiority in it. His name is Bram van den Berg.
Only reason to care is if Larry was put out by it.  I don’t know that he is.   Personally, I wish they’d just retire.  There is no clamor to perform Achtung live or recreate ZooTV.  It’s just a business now.  Has been for a while. And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.  But it is a bunch of rich old guys on stage, playing to a bunch of relatively rich old guys in the audience.   For my money this middle age guy would rather spend my money watching other middle age guys do their thing while they’re still exciting (The National).
Cool band that ran out of gas a long time ago. Anybody could play drums for U2. A drum machine might even do the trick.
Great video Rick. Did a bit of research: U2 will be paid $10 MILLION to "Produce" the show PLUS 90% of ticket sales.  They've been booked for a dozen shows. If average ticket prices are around the $250 mark they could make up to $50 MILLION. Add the original 10 plus any merch & record sales and Bono and lads could be looking at a windfall of $70 MILLION smackaroonies. Not bad for 12 gigs!!!! Btw, the replacement drummer is an unknown Dutch muso: Berg is his surname.  Apparently Bono hired him cos he's cheap 😆
Off the subject:  I watched Rihanna's Super Bowl halftime concert, then, by chance, I happened across a video of Peggy Lee singing "Is That All There Is?"  All by herself in the spotlight and live on stage, Peggy Lee commanded more attention from the audience than Rihanna and her 400 choreographed high-wire dancers ever could.  It was quite a lesson in what an artist can do.
4:51 I am glad to not know hardly anyone that thinks 'Eattle n' Hum' was any type of "misstep". We all agree with Rick, and I personally play that album most often.   Thank you for mentioning this Rick!  My wife told me about Larry not playing, I still can not believe it and think it's totally bunk.
Unforgivable Fire.
I’ve been a huge U2 fan since the first time I saw them in Worcester Massachusetts in 1984 I was only 15. I’ll never forget it. Seen them several times since. No Larry …. No shows.
I agree I think Larry is important but I don't think they're fighting maybe Larry wants to take a break and he had surgery.  And this is their job is to tour and do live music and they haven't done it for years and they're still pretty young so why not,  they probably already are under contract.
Geez Rick. I really admire your video’s but as a former music bizz insider I think you really overrate the influence of the U2 management on autonome minds like Bono and such.   And besides that….you as an online advocate of real musicians and genuine talent are really not doing that well deserved image any good in disrespecting the temporary drummer as ‘some fill in drummer’. Bram van den Berg is his name and he deserves a bit more respect from a guy like you. Although in a tiny country like The Netherlands, van den Berg is a hell of a drummer in the band he and his bandmates have for several decades. Breaking several records.   I get the emotional point on Larry you are making but let’s not forget there is a real life drummer, and great man behing the term ‘Some fill in guy’
Mount Temple School not Templemount😅
The only good U2 albums are with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois
Someone in a band named U2 needs to pay bills…
Rick, The Police were the hottest selling tour on the planet in 2007-2008. I thought it was better than the Synchronicity tour and also got the privilege of getting to see them at Churchill Downs.
Most overrated band in modern times
Rick, sorry, not one of your best hot takes videos. Maybe the replacement will be Ringo Starr or Dave Grohl.
Maybe  Bono , can adress the Ohio train Derailment DISASTER ?! nah..... Sssaahhhhh
So you, your buddy Rich, and your brother are "HUGE" U2 fans but had no idea about this? If you were "HUGE" U2 fans you'd know that Larry has been in pain and struggling for a while now. This shouldn't stop the band for fulfilling their commitments.  And throwing the Apple thing in there too. Way to kick a band while they're down. With fans like you, who need them?  It 12 friggin' shows. Grow up.
I literally took a torch to all my U2 CD’s after I saw the kind of person Bono is. He’s onboard with the new world order, just for starters.
no worries either way for me. i think u2 sucks.
Yea, I agree, Rick. You can’t replace Larry. Also agree with your characterization of those albums. Still remember in college sleeping on the sidewalk in front of a record store to be early in line for the Joshua Tree tour tix for the Los Angeles shows. 😊 And yes, I liked Rattle and Hum as well. Achtung Baby is a masterpiece.
I share the passion there, and appreciate Larry's longstanding contributions to the band. And I don't think their public statements are meant to put the whole truth out there. I'd have to guess that while Larry was firm on not participating until his recovery, the band was just as firm about playing live again.  It comes down to either a fill-in drummer or nothing at all until Larry can tour again.
Without Larry, U2 is just a 3 legged table, but, I guess the band told him "we're playing 'With or Without You'".
Yes, crazy for them to play without Larry and also I think it's crazy for them to do a las Vegas residency.
I liked the Music in the beginning and then I saw an Interview with ''God'' Bono and never again wasted my time. He is an arrogant Legend in his own mind that literally had the gall to say and believe that ''His'' band is the best band ever, amongst other things. So for this to happen doesn't surprise me in the least, I'll stop right there.
I love rattle and hum. How can anyone think that was a mistake? What. I own the movie too.
Love achtune baby. I saw that show at Foxboro stadium in 92. It was insane. Best concert I've ever seen.
At least they're out there doing some gigs and making people happy, even if less than ideal.  Hope Larry feels better and can get back out there too.  I don't think they're doing it for the money at this point (or ever did for that matter)...
A fan since 1985, but when achtung baby came out, that's when I starting letting go.  They need to stop before they ruin all our memories.  Enough with the politics too.
You're not a "big U2 fan" if you didn't know before 2 days ago that Larry was bowing out due to surgery.
I heard a while back that Larry has really bad arthritis and it is very hard for him to play.  This was several years ago so it is probably worse now.
The pedo cover of Songs of Innocence was also a weird moment. Definitely caused me to take a step back from the band.
1. The show must go on  2. Zoo TV imagery with HD or  4K  visuals should  be amazing  3. U2 concerts are hard  to beat  4. U2 don't  need more money  5. Yes.. Bono talks too much.. but I think he always means well  6. U2 's best work are behind them..but they always..always want to put on a good show.
Ricks not happy, been a fan for since 91 myself seen them a number of times, it’s definitely an odd situation, I think it’s nothing to do with wanting to play live again, I do believe they made commercial commitments and LMJ situation threw a spanner in the works, but this choice I don’t get,
How as Rattle and Hum a misstep? I still recall seeing that film in the theater.
They just wanna make piles of money with a fill in drummer. They needa feed the money machine.  So what.   People still pay to see the eagles and Fleetwood Mac and james Taylor.  It’s all about money.  Plain and simple. Don’t like it, do go see it.   Heck, ill bet the Grampa Stones will tour soon as well
I think Larry’s had enough. He’s hinted before that he’d be ok with the band doing less… probably just wants to ease into his golden years and enjoy the fruits of his labor. The others probably said “fine. We’ll do this with or without you.” (Had to 😊)
It's a simple equation. The band cancels their gigs or they find a replacement drummer. As you say, it happens all the time. I fully understand what Mullen means to the band (and the album) and no doubt many fans will be upset. But with all due respect, I am not sure why you saw a need for this video even with the bizarre Superbowl ad.
Totally agree. Not a fan at all of their recent albums.
I love you Rick but I feel like your boomer is showing. 😂
It's all about the money.  U2 ceased to be relevant a long time ago.  They are trying to milk a dead cow.  Sadly, it will probably work.
What's the problem? Bands change members all the time, even if they have been long standing/founding members..if they wanna play and get out there they should do so! Look at the stones!! Steve Jordan??
Achtung Baby is one of my favorite records of all time. There isn't a proper way to condense what U2 means to my brother and I, and how special that record in particular is to us and tough times in our life. While I may have moved on from following or caring about the band, Achtung Baby will always be firmly rooted at the psychological core of my musical experience, and it sounds just as good today as it does when it came out in '91
2 prime examples of this is Styx firing Dennis DeYoung and Yes firing Jon Anderson. Both at the time were ill and they decide to move on. Both were the creative force behind the bands. In both case the fans would like to see a reunion but those now controlling the band veto the idea.
C'mon, everyone knows how great it was when Phil Collins played with Zeppelin!  (that's sarcasm, kids)
So they should just not play out until he's fit? I'm struggling to feel outrage here. What does he have to say about it, btw?
Mistake. ....I know the show will be great. But. I'm not going.
I don't know. The show and the marketing campaign have probably been in the pipeline for a very long time. Tons of money spent, tons of preparation and planning. I really don't think this is a big deal. They play a show, you go see it or you don't.
Yeah, nah. Desperate, embarrassing & just plain wrong. No Larry, Bono’s voice is totally shot. Part of me feels as though they may be behest to the Live Nation machine and have no choice. Either way it’s just a terrible decision. Well & truly time to rack the microphone boys. Really should have happened a long time ago. I completely agree with Rick here. Once they were fresh, powerful and relevant, now it’s a sad, faded caricature of a once great musical force.
Not a huge U2 fan; don't really care.
Bang on Beato - this is a ghastly, cynical cash grab. Like they need it...  I guess there's a little more to it - Bun E Carlos?
U2 sold out long ago. Too bad. I loved them back in the day.
I'm convinced that NOBODY actually likes U2 - they only SAY they like U2, because their friends all "say" they like U2..  ad infinitum..
Rick, makes so much sense.  And your logic is fantastic.
It's not u2 without Larry Mullen Jr.  End of story. I've been a u2 fan all my life and seen the band live 40 times, ironically enough. This is a cash grab and I'm embarrassed and deeply disappointed that they would do this. I'm really really upset and will never see another u2 concert again!
OK, so I thought Rattle and Hum was amazing. On this issue though my guess is, Larry's issue  (whatever it is) came up after the ink had dried on this deal. I would further speculate that the band didn't seek out this residency and that it was born in Vegas as a nostalgia cash grab, the band is just honoring their contract.   “Of course, that’s just my opinion. I could be wrong.”  — Dennis Miller
I just like hearing your rant.
I hope they are waiting for Larry to get healthy and then doing The Joshua Tree and Earlier Tour. No offense to Achtung Baby
They are killing the legend factor
Funny how Rick stops mentioning great U2 albums after achtung baby 😂
U2 has sucked for decades, and Bono consistently makes bad decisions.  Go back and listen to 'War' and 'Achtung Baby' at home, and save your time and money from seeing a band that is LOOOOOOONG past their prime.
The rumours have it that the studio had to be aired out for about two weeks after they finished recording AB. 😁
Imagine if they did this when Bono fell off his bike
I'm curious to know the circumstances and timing around everything. I know from some past artists that have done residencies, that they have usually been in the wroks for a long time, and loads of money already poured into making it become a reality. I wonder if this is something they've been planning for a while and after it was set in stone something happened to Larry, which prompted the surgery, which then led to, "what should we do about this residency," which led to "well we can't get out of it without loosing a crap ton of cash." which led to, "hey guys, just do it without me till I can get better and meet you out there ASAP."  At least, that's what I'm hoping happened, because you're right, Rick... boneheaded move to do something like this without Larry... it just won't be the same. God forbid they're keeping a "Neal Peart" type of situation under wraps.
Hmmm, U2 was my favorite band throughout the 80s/90s/00s, and I supported them on each tour during the 10s.  I won't be going to Vegas though. U2 has always tried to "go big or go home" with promoting itself, so I don't mind the Super Bowl advertising (which I didn't see).  As for forging ahead without Larry, I guess everyone thought it was just too good an opportunity to pass up, but I think mainly they are just dying to get back out there playing concerts again, and maybe they know something we don't about Larry, i.e. maybe he's never coming back as a drummer, because of his physical issues.  I give them the benefit of the doubt, but I also have reached the end of the line in terms of shelling out money for expensive things like a trip to Vegas to see U2, which would run into hundreds of dollars (maybe even $1,000), especially without Larry, not that he is the main focus of attention on stage, but because it's always been the four of them on stage since 1978.  Furthermore, there last tour already was pretty much a combination of the new album from 2018 plus mostly songs from "Achtung Baby", so it's like I've already seen that.
Imagine how awesome a zoo TV concert will be inside that sphere
'Vegas' - nuff said.
Pretty sure because this MSG sphere is going to be the world's first state of the art 360 round stadium. And they want to be the first to play it, if they don't someone else will do it
3:39 AND DON'T ARGUE WITH ME.....He says "youtube's original manager"
U2 is one of the most overrated bands of all time. Just like Aerosmith I could be perfectly happy not hearing another song again for the rest of my life. I never understood why people placed them on such a pedastal.
You've got a point, but for me your conclusion at the end is not at all coherent with what you're were arguing before. Also, your thumbnail doesn't reflect your arguments at all - why even include the replacement drummer in there if you won't talk about him.   Money rules Rick. You know this, but the rant seems more emotional than anything. Hopefully Larry will be okay, but this doesn't look good.
Been a fan of the band for 30+ years. One of the most admirable and impressive things I find with U2 is their camaraderie and togetherness. The same line up without interruption for over 40 years. Simply put U2 is Bono, Adam, Larry and Edge.  When Bono was injured in 2010, U2 made the decision to cancel Glastonbury. Yes it was a disappointment but if they couldn't ALL play it,  then they'd wait until they could.  I think it's really poor that they're willing to go ahead with the Las Vegas residency without Larry. I think it would have been better received by fans and the media (in terms of integrity and solidarity) if the band declined the gigs, saying sorry but we can't do this without Larry....maybe next year.  Where is that group mentality? That integrity and loyalty?  Larry was interviewed just before the Kennedy Awards and his answers appeared quite negative. Almost like he was unaware and uninformed of U2's plans for the coming year.  Get the impression that Larry has decided he's had enough, Bono and Edge are desperate to continue at all costs and Adam is very torn and conflicted. Can't help feeling a bit disappointed.
I saw the Zoo Station tour (Actung Baby).  Pixies opened.   One of my top 5 concerts ever!
Why didn't they just issue a press release about Larry Mullen Junior being replaved? Tjen they could jave clarifoed rhings by staring whether this was a temporary or a permanent rhing and alsonwhh rheh choose ro take that move.
I agree completely !
Heh, it sounds like you keep accidentally calling the band "youtube!"
Good thing the band really sucks now. Know one cares about their concerts, and out of touch Bono can’t shut his political mouth. Just play the old songs, dork!
I first saw U2 at the US Festival in 1982. So there. ;-)  But I'm sure that U2 (and their new manager) looked at the cost of a Super Bowl ad and figured it was worth it in terms of making a big splash and reaching their core audience all at once in a way no other medium could. I don't know what the viewership for the game is, but it's not trivial. And it's not like it's a one-and-done thing. Everyone who buys ad time on the Super Bowl amortizes the investment by repurposing the ad content and then re-broadcasting it on cheaper outlets like XM, YouTube, etc. But they must have thought a "big rock band" deserved a "big splashy PR stunt". Whaddevuh. I just wonder if Bono is going to use the Vegas residency to go "full Elvis." :-D
They miss the faces I'm sure... Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson, Jackson, Grant, and Franklin.
First album I ever bought was was How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb when I was 14. Soon bought every U2 album after that and have seen them 15 times since. Achtung Baby and Zooropa were always my favorites, and Zoo TV was the tour I would have loved to be able to see if I was older. I am excited and let down for the residency at the same time. I live in AZ so Vegas is easy enough of a drive but it won't feel the same without Larry
The idea of a residency in Vegas officially removes the last vestiges of cool and renders them artistically valueless. Unless the entirety of the profit is donated to charity and/or a private project with charitable intent, this is a money grab plain and simple. U2, a band that preach humanist and Christian values and use tax shelters to avoid paying their fair share. Fuck'em.
This is nothing compared to the Pantera "reunion" travesty without the Abbott brothers. Pure greed.
Nothing wrong with this at all. This residency has been one of the worst kept secrets in the music industry for the past several years and Larry’s decision to get surgery was a recent one. Larry is getting these surgeries now because he WANTS to extend his time with the band. Honestly, this is probably the best time to do it. The band are not promoting new material and are not going to be constantly on the road with this Vegas residency. It is a natural pause for the band’s normal touring/recording pace.  Regarding the residency, nothing wrong with it at all. The band has never done one before, so it will be exciting to see U2 as a long-term fixture in Vegas. They are designing a show centered around Achtung Baby, which will utilize the advanced multi-media capabilities that the MSG Sphere is touting. I think this is the perfect album to do this with and am excited to see what they can draw up.  Do people really have problems with the Super Bowl ad? The intent is to not only advertise the show, but also the MSG Sphere venue.
Mullen has long been considered the founder of U2. He posted an ad on his high school bulletin board looking for musicians. It was reported that Larry had some serious issues with his neck and elbows that needed surgery. He was advised to stay at home and recuperate
I think it was other drummers who came in to teach Larry Mullen Jr the drum beats
Not surprised. To me, after JT, U2 were only about raking it in with middle of the road inoffensive little tunes. After Boy, October, War, Under a Bloodred Sky, in my opinion, they were done, musically.
Honestly, why wouldn't they play with a substitute? Nobody is forcing you to go and see them and I'm sure they will sell all the (probably way to expensive) tickets...
Something's fishy. There's ZERO reason why U2 couldn't just wait til Larry is feeling tip top and fully recovered to begin their Vegas residency. I genuinely hope he's okay and I fear that he's worse off than they're sharing. Inside the band, they could be aware that Larry is in dire condition and that this is the transitional pivot they've all agreed on. If this were a simple ailment being treated with surgery followed by recovery, the band would postpone & stand by their bro.
probably a dumb question (as I'm not a U2 fan), but are fans going to pony up the big bucks to see a beloved band minus one of the legends no matter what ?
My bet is the add had more to do with the Venetian/Sphere than it did with U2. Either way, I'll be going to one of the shows. Bummed Larry isn't playing. But what can you do?? Health takes precedent.
Few organizational units in history have come up with more bad ideas than rock bands.  Rock bands gonna rock band.
They should give Bill Berry a call. He's drumming a bit more now. Plus he was a good backing vocalist.  The only problem is Bill was REM's bullshit detector. He'd really be working overtime with Bono. More detecting than drumming.
"You glorify the past when the future dries up."
It is an odd move.  I’m sure there are contract arrangements they need to honor.  But I think you point to another issue here , maybe it’s time U2 ‘ walk on’ into a graceful retirement.
Saw them live @ The Commodore Ballroom in 81' Cool band to have caught in a 1200 seater. Almost as cool as catching The Police and Allan Holdsworth in 200 seaters.  Ah, the good ole days...And U2 was hungry then and just killed it.
Not great, but still  better than 'The Cars' without Ric Ocasek.
U2 is one of those bands where every member brings a unique flavor to the band. Larry Mullen Jr's drums are iconic. I can hear the drums right now in Sunday, Bloody Sunday without listening to it. It's amazing drumming. So iconic.   I agree with you on this, Rick. Not having Larry in the band when Larry is fully capable is a misstep. Give him the time off to rest and recoup and then hit it. Don't replace.
WHY oh why are they doing this?  The same reason U2 does everything ...$$$$$.
0:52 Fantastic drummer
In football, all the great ones (Namath, Favre, Esiason, Rogers, and now Brady) tend to hang on one season too long and wind up tarnishing their legacy.  In rock music, it's even worse.  The great ones hang on DECADES too long and wind up sounding like a Vegas lounge act.  The Stones should have called it quits at the turn of the millenium.  Chicago has only three original members left, and they're still hanging on, even though they don't sound anything like they used to.  Fleetwood Mac is a never-ending soap opera.  (I can sing higher than Stevie Nicks, and I'm a baritone!)  The Eagles should have wrapped it up after Glenn Frey passed away.  Bruce Springsteen's voice is a mere shadow of what it used to be.  And now U2 is applying a defibrillator to themselves.  Guys--you're not in your 20's anymore.  Find a shred of dignity and make a graceful exit.
I like the passion. But U2 and controversy go hand in hand. Rattle is certainly not the most controversial album, either. Pop was. But here's a band with notoriously minimal drama, and all the money is in playing live right now. James Dolan is a spoiled brat rich kid who's once again in the media for all the wrong reasons, so maybe this is also him pushing his businesses to take the stink off those board room meetings, who knows. The question is why is the drummer not playing with them? Maybe because he's recouping form surgery... Is this that big of a deal? They ain't no spring chickens so timetables are not quite as reliable as, let's say Baseball players. Even after 30 the docs just can't know, so they "play it by ear..." You are signing on for a residency for $10mil. People are going to want guarantees the show will go on, so they need to know it will even if a sub is needed.   Now, if that's the deal they all signed, there is no drama here. There are contracts and obligations that need to be met. This is the brave new world. Bands like U2 don't have the revenue stream form royalties anymore. The part of the story we are all missing is the fact that U2 are doing a residency for $10 mil signing bonus up front, and 90% of the gate for 12 shows. Come on, Rick, this is the info I expect to get when I come here. And the internet is a beautiful thing. It doesn't matter when an album came out. It's all out there for 7 billion to enjoy or dismiss. So they know what they're doing. They need to fill 17k seats for 12 shows and still have songs left in the tank. Like, how much can they get for Joshua Tree? Those fans are of an age where they have disposable incomes all over the place and Vegas is very, very good at targeting people with cash burning a hole in their pocket. On the basis of Achtung Baby they can gauge what every single other album will do, or if they should do albums vs just a setlist, as well as how much they should demand for their next residency.
Replacing a drummer in an old band is like replacing the brakes in an old car.  They just wear out.  Dick Dale could burn out a drummer in a year.
Huge U2 fan here. I was turned on to U2 back in 1981 by a foreign exchange student from Dublin. He worked at the Hilton in Washington DC; I was a junior in high school. He had a cassette tape and recorder from U2 playing on the hill behind his house! Do you guys remember the portable tape recorders that you needed 2 fingers to press the buttons to "record"? Yeah, that's how old I am! One day he dragged me into the sporting goods room and made me listen to U2 and I was forever hooked. A few months later I heard an announcement on radio station 99.1 WHFS about U2 playing Richie Coliseum at U of MD. I cut school and saw them at this 1950's built college gymnasium with the bench seats that pulled out from the wall. I think there were maybe 60 people at the show, and they played a few songs twice! I have never missed a show and have seen most shows more than once. I will be selling a kidney on Ebay to fund the U2 Vegas trip. I hope to see you there, Rick. BTW.. absolutely LOVE your channel and I don't play any instruments!
So much for the Bono interview.....
One thing I have heard is that they signed the contract before knowing Larry would need surgery, so they were contractually bound to do it. They'd lose a ton of money over lawsuits.
Long time fan, but with or without Larry I'm tired of spending money on them.  SOE tour was a snooze.  One thing I never thought I'd be at U2 show was bored.
This is off-topic, but I just recently learned that you produced a demo for a band called Smugface back in the early 2000's.  They went on to become City Sleeps, but that 3-song demo was one of the best sounding demos of anyone in the local area at that time!  I was amazed when I read that you worked with them.  Just a fun fact I learned today.  Cheers!
It’s like if Floyd played without Roger Waters.  Oh, wait!
Bram van den Berg (the Dutch drummer) is no more and no less than the new Jimmy Nichol.... 😂
I have been a fan of U2 since the October album and I am still a loyal fan to this very day however it is my opinion that the band has been without a singer ever since the 2000 release of all that you can't leave behind! Let us be honest folks and fans alike Bono has lost his voice and has not been able to hit a note properly in many years and to watch him get up there and wail like a coyote with emphysema is heartbreaking and pathetic! Larry can recover and be honest about his situation but Bono is delusional!
Saw them up close at the Apollo in 2018 and it was one of the best shows I've ever been to. I also had a female celebrity ask for my phone number (she was standing behind me and my friend for the entire show) and I was so drunk that I didn't recognize her at first and blew my opportunity. I no longer drink. I don't care if Larry can't make it -- I'm assuming if he isn't there, it's for a valid health concern, and this has been planned for a while, so backing out at this point probably would have cost a lot of money -- not to mention jobs for their road crew. I don't blame them for carrying on.
Led Zeppelin. No Bonzo No band
U2 completely lost me during the Zooropa/Discotheque period. They should have called it quits after that.
''Why don't they just not listen to it?''. Because iPhones have limited data and charge for extra space when it runs out. I don't want 1 bit wasted on that trash.  ''Hey Siri, play my songs on random shuffle function'', is not a command I want to have to further qualify with ''but NOT U2!'' every time.
It’s called contractual obligations Rick - Larry did not recover in time for the tour so they need to go forward - what’s hard to believe ?
U2 lost me....like madonna ....this is not an example of aging gracefully.
Doesn't really matter. It was all downhill after Boy.
2:08 "YouTube" hasn't played a live 'gang' since December 2019 😄
The U2-Apple iPod thing happened in 2004, not 2014. Steve Jobs was still alive & running the company.
Ridiculous. One of the the most overrated bands ever. I saw them in Johannesburg on the Pop tour and they were fucking awful. This is a cash grab from a band who really don't need the cash.
I was a huge U2 fan up until the last two albums.  I remember cruising around and listening to them on college radio.  UF, JT, and AB are classics.  I liked R&H and the movie also.  They seemed to have lost a step from the earlier U2.    And being a drummer why didn't I get a call to fill in!!   bastards!    lol
U2 was great in the 80s and early 90s. I don't care for their stupid politics, front man, and prefer they go away. I will make every effort to avoid wasting my money and time. Great video!
U1.5
Agreed with you!
really ... look at the Stones ,  as long as Bono and Edge are there I'm pretty sure thats all they need
I hear you Rick.  I understand your frustration, and I share some of it.  Was there no way to hold off this gig until Larry could perform?  Did the new manager sign a contract that prevented such a cancellation and delay?  It's all possible.     Reading from sources on line, such the Irish Times, they are saying that Larry need surgery due to some problems in his neck and elbows.   As a person who has also suffered neck vertebrae problems, such a thing is very painful and debilitating.  I'm a guitar player, and I would venture that a drummer is really going to suffer from such problems.  I don't know the extent of what his condition is.  It very well may be that the elbow issue is related to his neck issue.  For me, the surgery went very well, and recovery took some time, as your head is help up by a neck brace in order to relax your neck muscles, all the while waiting for the healing from the surgery.   I wish Larry the best.     I love U2.  I started listening to them in college back in 1984, and have loved their music and messages since then. I have to mention that I've seen Bono live on a couple of TV shows, and he looks older than his years.  I hope he is well.  He has been an inspiration human being to me, and to all of his fans who share his views.
Maybe there's a reason behind him not joining them. I doubt that he's being excluded. Maybe he just doesn't want to do it and the rest of them do. They are being up front about him not playing with them. I don't see what the BFD is.
I live now in Berlin. ZooStation is a place I go as a resident. Saw the show in Miami in 1991. Not as good as The Joshua Tree show in 1987. But they were onto something. They always were back then. But their moment has passed. I mean, they are not RUSH man. They simply do not have THOSE kind of fans. Love 'em, love what they did then. But not loving it now.
Introducing The Ultimate U2 Cover Band!!! - LIVE FROM LAAAAASSSSS VEEEEEGASSSSS! It's:   U2-SORTA!!!!  That's right! U2 Sorta! - All the original band members are there, except the one that isnt. The one that makes us groove properly. Don't worry - We're using a drum machine instead.  Larry never gets drunk or smiles anyway. Niether does the drum machine! Both have perfect timing. (Maybe a little too perfect.) We're charging $10,000 for Lodge GA tickets! We're U2 Sorta! WE ARE OLD AND POOR!!! We need MONEY!!!! Wheelbarows full of it! Lots and lots of wheelbarrows. No, wait!!!: DUMP-TRUCKS! Dump-trucks full of $100 bills scRaped together by our working class fans out of their social security and WalMart paychecks  ....Over the counter, with that shotgun. Pretty soon, everybody's got one!  DESIRE!!!!  (clearly it got the best of them...)
U2 have been the most important band in my life but I can't tolerate this.  This is such a massive blunder.
The tour should be called Rattle and Dumb,or Achtung Lazy,The Forgettable Fire.Larry you Can leave behind.
You make some good points @RickBeato but I don't agree with one of the last ones. I was born in 70 and a LOT of my favourite and most listened to music is from late 60's before I was born and early 70's when I was too young to have heard/remember it. Would you have a more nostalgic attachment to the music if you actually lived through it? Sure. But that doesn't mean you can't connect to music from before your time. I'd say most of the music I listen to is from bands that are long gone.
It's called "Jumping the Shark" in Hollywood. Seriously. U2?   Vegas residency?   This is a disgrace. Time for the lads to hang-up their spurs. If the members need an audience they should go solo and build new careers around something other than U2. All this residency does is turns them into a U2 cover band.
Spoken like a fan! From the heart. Way to go. I've been a fan since the opened, yes opened for J. Geils in Louisville, KY.
Great mention on The Police, Rick. At the time, I thought it was crazy when they broke up. But they went out with a catalog that is pretty much, all killer; no filler. The Police knew when to not overstay their welcome!
So True!! Exactly what I think
I lost respect for Bono after his name was revealed as part of the Panama papers investigation.... hypocrite!
Zeppelin refused to go on without Bonham, back in the day.  11 years, and that was it.  With increasingly large gaps in between albums and tours near the end...
99% - esp. the Vegas crowd - can name Bono, and maybe the Edge.
like Bono sang in 1997 - they put Jesus in show business, now it's hard to get in the door. i'm rather disillusioned at this point.
Grow up dude, U2 are sellouts. Likely Tavistock Institute and NWO shills. Ffs people in IRELAND hate them🤣
Complain about something important.
Who is the fill-in drummer?
yeah no larry no U2. I agree Rick. and said so on facebook but I didn't get good replies lol. whatever. people hear the band name get all excited and dont' pay attention
I think it's a fine criticism - basically, why not wait and reschedule the dates at this state-of-the-art venue? I think they are all getting older and feeling the finality of their careers. I can't blame them for wanting to dwell in the light a little longer before hitting the twilights of their careers - we have seen bands like the Stones, The Who and Aerosmith go on with credible effect. It's cool younger kids can see these bands still. One thing about U2 - they have had the rarity and the gift of preserving their friendship, partnership and entire band with all original members for 4 incredible decades. To me, it's not about the need to know when to stop, it's about appreciating them while they are here still doing it for us. The second a member goes, it's just not U2 anymore. We've gotten the ACTUAL U2 for 40 years! That is just nuts, and all their interesting missteps aside, they put on the best live show ever, pound for pound, that can go toe to toe with any rock greats. They care a lot about the fans and the fan experience, which shows. That being said, why not just wait for Larry? Sure, a lot of money is tied up, but you can't tell me that another artists wouldn't gladly slip into those dates, freeing U2 of any contractual obligation and giving Larry time to heal so he can come back ready for the gigs at the Sphere. Do the right thing, boys!
Rick, correct me if I am wrong but I think that your rant is about the fact that U2's persona (at least to me) was that they were originally a virtuous image of purity and integrity that transcended rock and roll depravity. This Vegas residency sounds like the ultimate sell-out, to the point where they don't even care enough to bring their original lineup back for long-time fans.
Love your videos, Rick.  This one is getting a lot of views, understandably.  Honestly, I don’t think this is a big deal.  Now, if The Edge couldn’t make it and Bono rang up John Mayer to fill in, I could maybe understand the outrage.😉  Seriously, though, these “residency” gigs are like manna from Heaven.  They don’t have to jump around from city to city, there is a steady flow of audience, and it’s a pretty nice place to set up shop for a while (dry heat and all).  Drumming must be murder on the body after four decades, so I can understand wanting to sit this one out.  The greater good is keeping the music fresh and reaching new audience.  Guaranty they will impress and win new fans, perhaps a younger generation that never heard music like this live.
What everyone seems to be missing is these shows aren't about U2: it's the debut of this new venue in Las Vegas. Apparently, it will have 360 degree visuals/screens that go around the building including the back walls behind the audience.
Maybe Bono could pusue the musical career. Make a musical about Ant-man.
People=money.
They move in Mysterious Ways.
These guys aren't young men anymore, if they want to play live they should play. Mullen has said he intends to take 2023 off to get right, so the other 3 should do what they want. Those Vegas shows will be in demand.
So do they have to break up if he doesn't recover? I mean, I get that Zep quit after Bonham died, and Queen limp on like their own tribute band (God bless you, Brian, x.) but I've seen plenty of gigs by great bands who don't have all the original members. By this measure, most bands should quit gigging after their first album. I'll confess, I had no idea who Larry Mullen Jr was until this video, and I still couldn't tell you the bassist's name, because U2 are, put simply, Bono and the Edge.  Oasis were the Gallaghers. If Chris Martin wandered on stage with a handful of session musicians and played a Coldplay set, 90% the audience wouldn't even notice.  It is obvious that millions of dollars has already been spent, organising and promoting the shows. Countless lawyers have been hired, contracts have been signed and Bono has his eye on a new super-yacht. You think they're going to pull out cus a drummer had to bail. A drummer? Come on.
First they’re getting older and it’s probably more difficult to travel. Also I’d venture to guess that the majority of people that would pay for tickets to see a show are in their 40s and 50s.  The bulk of which are actually not huge fans that go see concerts on the regular… they’re the folks who travel with their spouse on a vacation to Vegas without their kids. These people will be their audience.
The weirdest part to me is that Larry let it happen. Believe it or not, U2 is a democracy both practically and financially. Everything is split equally. I'm so surprised that Larry let it happen. They could have vetoed the management idea. So, all I can think of is that the cash grab was just too big to pass up? Why else would they do it?
Of what i understood, is that, larry is recuperating of a surgery, and they got one more huge deal, who no one wants to be miss, which it was presenting on a new live show at a new las vegas venue.  They kicked off Larry? No way!  But they need a drummer!  In my humble opinion, U2 as a comercial band(nothing wrong with that) they need a new hype and probably opening a new state of the art Las vegas Venue, is what they need!
Everyone blaring on about when they played ONE gig without Adam cos he was too effed up that particular night, that was a last minute call as it was one of the 2 shows they were filming for the Zoo TV video release but ended up using all the footage from the next night when Adam was back cos U2 isn't U2 without Adam, just like it's not U2 without Larry. Please stop trying to compare the two situations. I've seen U2 three times, the last in London in 2015 on the innonence tour but have totally lost interest in them these days and this backs up why. Sad.
When the members are iconic, it’s short changing the fans. Unless that member will never play again.
Has the fill in drummer ever heard of Jimmie Nicol? If the answer is no, welcome to the same level of relevance.
"Some bands replace people."  Just look at AC/DC!!!
How do I get u2 off my phone that’s all I want
Rick Have you listened to anything by Greg Lake I was listening to him a few minutes ago playing the song in the beginning I was so enjoying the beautiful guitar parts in that song to get time listen to it if you haven't listened to him for awhile Lori night have a good day
Drummers wear out. Two words: Neil Peart.
Right,  for some reason (for this band), he is their drummer.  Now, when I saw, for example, the Sabbath show (2013),  it was ok that Ward wasn't there (for whatever reason). In fact, Brad Wilk's solo (not boring!) gave the geezers some rest time...before kickin out Iron Man. Again, Larry Mullen, Jr. is the drummer for U2...period.  U2, you're integrity is @ stake here. To me, that's far more important than all the accolades. So, how bout this? Sit your asses down, make a NEW  record, and then tour...as U2. Dare to be different, guys!!
Very Weird
My thoughts: Larry Mullen Jr is probably the only dude in the band that was like “Las Vegas residency? That’s cheesy. I ain’t doin’ it.” And the band was like “okay, have it your way.” I mean… they could have waited for his surgery to be done. It’s BS. Rush waited years for Neil to come back. Any band that moves on because a particular member is going through health issues doesn’t like that particular member. Look at Yes: they left Anderson behind when he got sick. Let’s face it: Yes was probably getting tired of Anderson. Something is strange here in the land of U2.
Sad thing is it's Vegas and in the new MSG sphere so it's a sell out no matter what.
Bono loves the attention. He will eventually replace Wayne Newton.
Agree to bad so sad but Little Feat without Lowell George well That’s Not Little Feat
By now, it should be clear U2 is a cult. And its greatest devotees are the band members themselves. Enough already.
On one hand, I think Larry has played enough landmark shows with his mates over the years that he probably isn't feeling any FOMO. Like any long lasting and healthy union there needs to be space as much as there is intimacy.  On the other hand, the idealist in me would rather see them wait and play with their original teammate.  Realistically, the man has been drumming for 45 years. It was going to be his wrists or Bono's throat to go first. It's... fine.
U2 is THE most overrated band ever, IMHO. This is a money grab, plain and simple. Boner will puff up his chest and say how wonderful he is and Edge will try to make listenable sounds with his guitar and completely fail once more. Two of the biggest TOOLS in the music world. I saw the Joshua Tree tour at the Pontiac Silverdome years ago. Worst show I've ever seen.
Play a drum track and have Larry there live on tambourine.
Bono, another frontman turned into a hypocrite politician...
Where are some of the new videos going? There was just a music theory video that used Disarm by the Pumpkins. Gone. A week or so ago there was a video on Nirvana. Gone. I need to start downloading these videos before they get deleted.
A-cash-in Baby!
Everything must end. If you can, why not end WELL?
It must be bad if he won't  be ready  in 7 months
I very much enjoy all your videos and I do watch most of them. But I finally utterly UtTerLy disagree with you.  Why should they not perform with a stand in? And promote their show? They have said this is temporary, they are not recording any new music, and if you don't like it don't buy a ticket this time.  What you are saying is that The Who should never have played live after Keith Moon died, that Queen does not have the right to play concerts post Freddy.  I would say that a band themselves decide what they can an cannot do, and the audience then makes up their minds about if they want to be a part of it. Not the other way around.  PS. This opinion is of course in no way influenced by the fact that they have chosen a dutch drummer... ;)
Not a u2 fan.
Sadly, a financial decision, not an artistic one. Personally, I'd want to wait, otherwise you haven't really seen U2. Different matter if this was the only way to see them, but presumably, Larry will be back. I'd go to see, say, Bono and The Edge doing a stripped down tour of smaller venues, because that wouldn't be billed as a full on U2 gig, and although I'm sure the Las Vegas gigs will be great shows, it smacks of the same corporate mindset that has brought us ludicrous ticket prices for, say, Springsteen gigs - another decision that doesn't sit well with the perception of that artist's values (and I'm a fan of both bands). 😎
Even though I'm a big fan, U2 has run  their course.  They've ripped off their own sound and that upcoming songs of surrender sounds like unplugged versions of big hits, and not a reinventing as the band claims.  Sometime it's even harder to walk away.
Bono is dead to me. He's become such a WEF/corporate schill I just cant take it. (He was even at The State of Union address..amazing)
Never understood the hate for rattle and hum. I love that album
Thought about this overnight……nobody mentioned U2 becoming a Vegas act, i.e. lounge lizards. Thoughts?
everytime i watch ur vids i am blown away by ur knowledge!!!
In addition to the points of your commentary, Rick, how do they recreate the spectacle that was ZooTV for their "new" fans in a casino auditorium?
Was a big U2 fan until the turn of the century. Garbage since then
Was it not that they already have the Vegas residency booked as their full band and Larry’s surgery is a recent development requiring the decision to back out or delay the residency?
We’ll said Rick, love U2 always have, can’t believe they would play without Larry, very disappointing..
Bono is giving the proceeds to Ukraine and the George Bush library
Dude, look at Yes touring now. Steve Howe is the only “original” member. Howe is basically in a tribute band
Heres my two cents...they should have waited for Larry. As fans know, we waited on Vertigo tour for Edges daughter. We waited on 360 tour for.Bono. And now these 12 shows cant wait ??? And give AB a proper stadium tour, not fancy Vegas for Richie Rich and celebs....
I've always liked U2 since early 80s however I could do without Bono's political BS it's kinda hard to overlook. Maybe Larry Mullen has had it with lefty political view points of Bono.
Big fan of Rick and U2. But U2 IS LARRY 2.
The balloons in the sky everyone was looking up at and asking "what is that?" is what got me.  These Chinese balloons are fresh in our minds freakin us all out and U2'S intro is  freaking balloons in the sky that nobody knows what they are???
This rant is shared by 1% of u2 fans. The rest just wants to hear their music giving a rats ass who is bashing the drums, and they probably won't hear any difference anyways.
So what happened to Larry? I think Rattle and Hum is amazing and don't understand why anyone would think different.
Seen Journey lately?
I agree with Rick.  But it's not as bad as the Pantera thing going on, which is akin to Van Halen touring without Eddie.  Greed has no bounds.
chaa chiiinggg🤑🤢
I was 16 in 1987 when I saw U2 at the Pontiac Silverdome. I’ll never forget that opening , then walking onstage. To use a cliche , to me as teenager at the time , it was a religious experience. I’d been a fan forever and to see them progress to the Joshua Tree was beautiful. I still have the tourbook. Love the channel Rick !
Would you feel the same about the Stones going on without Charlie Watts? Just interested. I agree with everything you've said re U2.
I lived in Boston and was at the March 6, 198  U2 concert  at the Paradise. It was the October show which was simulcast by WBLC. I still have the tape (which I recorded from the radio). After the pandemic  also stopped our band and eventually broke up the all original music band, I totally understand why they have the desire to move forward. I can only imagine that  this was agreed on by the original members. I'm almost 67 and have been playing guitar since I saw the  Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show.  The sound of Jimi Hendrix started my journey to electronics trying to get that sound. I understand the new drummer is from The Netherlands where I currently live. Thet need to make a living as we all do. That ad is some very  expensive promotional  activity.
Sorry...U2 Sucks...Bono is a schreecher and pompous as hell..Edge is a 3 chord rythym robot...Just cannot ber bothered whem theire are so many better bands
I agree with Rick on this. Maybe it's a musician's perspective a little bit to understand more fully the contribution of each band member to the entity, beyond just what is visible during the 3 hours on the stage. I feel that there are some bands where one or two members are the figureheads or primary creators and maybe other members might be less integral to the bands identity. U2 is so unique in the "topsy, turvy world of rock and roll" for remaining 4 original members, 4 characters, 4 friends...It just feels like they should not present themselves as U2 without Larry. Yes, a different drummer could play Larry's drum parts spot on...not the point. Almost any other band could get away with continuing on minus certain members, not U2. It will diminish their identity to MANY of us lifelong fans. It has defined U2 and elevated them as the years have piled up, so much so that they  have attained a certain mythical status for remaining this ideal of what a band could and should be. Are we expecting too much out of our mortal heroes??😉
IDK on this one, I get what you're saying, but... I just saw that Soundgarden is touring without Chris Cornell (how's that even possible?), Van Halen replaced DLR and was fine, the Stones replaced Bill Wyman and were fine, and more recently the heart and soul of the band, Charlie Watts (RIP) and the show goes on... Seems like it's the way of big acts, they replace people and move on.
Adam Clayton missed a show during the ZOO TV tour - and they didn’t cancel the gig, he was replaced by a bass technician.  This isn’t a big deal.  How did you not bring up Charlie Watts? Drummer for 58 years - replaced. More recently Taylor Hawkins - 25 years.
This gig that U2 are playing is a promotion for the venue. "The Sphere" is a $1.8 billion entertainment facility scheduled to open at the end of September,  and they have the biggest band in the world lined up to draw the people in. It has been in the works for a long time. I was in Vegas in June 2022 and it was known then. The fact that Larry needs surgery is an unfortunate damper on the event, but the show must go on. Hopefully this kicks off a world tour, to go with the new rekindled album.
ur take on prince bands then??
Songs like "one"  have been in the charts! I watched the grammys 2023: Beoynce is now the star with the most grammys in history: I did not recognise one song and can't remember one song - only the costumes. Everybody had a cosmecitc surgery. That really shocked me as European. (I only remember Trevor Noah as moderator). The pop music industry treats artists like chicken in a battery farm : )
Every old muso knows that it's the drummer who works hardest.. physically. All the best to this lad.  'Achtung Baby' is a masterpiece, but I have always felt that it was mainly Brian Eno's masterpiece.
"U2" is not a band but a corporation, sadly. It is sad they cannot wait for their mate; the "show" must go on, they still lack some millions or the adrenaline to mitigate their egos.
$$$$$$
I have a feeling that the Larry is all for this and encouraging the band to play on. If I got sick and couldn't go on a vacay I was planning for a long time with my three best friends, I'm telling them to go without me and have a great time!  I'm sure Larry feels awful that his health is interfering with the bands plans, but if I were in his shoes, I'd feel even worse if they cancelled everything on my account! It won't be the same without Larry, but I suspect that they will be able to find a halfway decent fill in.
Achtung Baby is their best album.  The shows make sense. Back in about 2007 I met a teenager who said she was a massive U2 fan, but did;t know AB.  I laughed, and introduced it to ear. Mind blown, she embraced it immediately.  The dern young people today are rediscovering older music.  I have no doubt the shows will be sold out to fans of all ages.
Im sure this is with the blessing of Larry. Drumming is HARD on a 60 yr old body. They’re thinking it was good enough for Elvis. No travel, which is brutal on tour.
The dollars. They don't need them,  but they don't want to lose any.
Everyone we all know, U2 has the success, the money, and the power to tell the promoters/managers, Hey let's hold off on this Las Vegas Residency until Larry Mullen Jr. is better.   End of story, Rick you are 100 percent right on this.   I agree, all these years the band has been the same four, now for money they are  going to just throw that away.   I think it sucks, they should hold off until Larry is able to be there.  Not right.
bono has - many times now - taken full responsibility for the apple debacle. read his book! yes, that is my takeaway from this video because i’m tired of talking about the larry thing. 😆
please comment in a similar way on TOTO...;-)
Yeah, when is enough, enough. When you think money is more important than a buddy you have for 43 years.
U2 is way Over Rated! Way Over Paid!!!! They Suck!!!! I wouldn't go see them for Free!
Totally agree... U2 is a band that's not the same when one of the guys is not there... The manager who had that stupid idea should be fired immediately... Period.
U2 bowing down before the system. Hats off to Eric Clapton, Van Morrison and Roger Waters. They are real artists.
The U2 tide has been rolling out since The Joshua Tree's high water mark. If you look carefully you can see them way way out to sea.
It would be at least acceptable if the band were going to donate 1/4 of the proceeds to Larry's medical... oh, wait, he has that horrible Socialized Health Care, and won't go bankrupt getting out of the hospital. Never mind, let the fans know he's getting a cut anyway. I can't imagine the fans letting the replacement get away with trying to personalize the drum parts to 'make his mark'.
u2 jumped the shark years ago...hard pass.
Memo to Tim Cook: Give up the Apple car dude...it will never sell...no one is going to buy a car from their phone peeps.
Larry clearly said "If u2 plays in 2023...it won't be with me." Larry is older now and never was a spotlight seeker like Bono...
Chris Buzby (Echolyn) says hello...he is one of my best friends!
Bono basically never wants to become irrelevant...
Relax everybody...The Beatles hired a temporary drummer to fill in for 8 shows on their 1964 world tour-Jimmy Nicol-when Ringo was hospitalized with tonsillitis. The shows went on without a hitch 'n Ringo rejoined as soon as he had recovered. In retrospect no big deal but at the time I'm sure there were some doubters...
Old man yells at Bono-shaped cloud.
The problem with this chioce is not only that LMJ will not be there. That's "a problem", but its also a legitimate choice (and anyway, all the best to Bram Van Der Berg, who I'm sure will make the job done).   The real issue, at least for me, with this tipe of thing is that U2 will play 12 concerts in a venue that it cost 2 billion to be built. It's a superexclusive show that will probably see the price of the tickets going to a level that will be insane. 12 concerts celebrating one of your most beloved album that will took place only in one city in the world, with prices that will not be so "popular", probably; but in the band statement they said that they are excited to see the fans again! Which fans? A super-elitarian minority of the fans. And also they're doing this without on of their member. Of course, its not a band's fault that LMJ is not going well with his health; but..c'mon guys! I know that U2 are obsessed to be relevant and the "number 1", but ehy, its not your time anymore, and that could be GOOD for you and your music! And anyway, let's be honest; U2 music its not so good since 20+ years; also here its not thier fault of course, a lot of bands fatigued to be creative after 10 years togheter, not to mention after 45... but U2 can at least do some better chioces, from my humble standpoint.   I'm still an U2 afecionado (not a fan anymore, but an afecionado), as they are are the band of my childhood and I "defended" them from people who love to costantly bash them - of course if I think that the opinions of who bash them are...bad; and its not always the case - over the same issues. Yes the Apple thing was annoying but it was only an album on an Iphone; people reacted to that like if they made a murder..; yes, Bono can be annoying with his charity work but for me it's only a passionate man; yes the taxes issue was bad managed but I cannot argue about the fact that U2 are a "world business", not only an Irish one... And I still say that it's kind of unfair to say that U2 are a crap band, because for twenty years they were not. Yes, you could not appreciate them but back in the days they have some great substance and a lot of professionality.   But the band obsession to still be relevant and to be "the top of the game"  had been the main causes of poor artistic and extra-artistic chioces. Their music became bland and predictable., and they're managing their affairs in a way which suggest, at least to me, that building their heritage and create money after it its their main purpose. U2 are become the opposite of cool, but they' still desperatly want to be relevant. For me it's a nonsense and they are in a cul de sac since 2000. Which is a shame 'cause U2 for some years were one of the coolest band around (especially during the '90ies).   I admire them a lot but this kind of choices are very different from the ones that they made from 1980 to 2000. It's seems that another band taked place of the old one, musically and "ethically". It's weird.   Well, that only my opinion, man.
First of all.. I've been a U2 fan since 1980. When I count my two upcoming shows I will have seen them 33 times live. Larry initially never liked U2's 90s stuff. Too experimental and progressive for the most conservative member of the band. He was the main reason the band almost broke up during the making of AB. And.. Larry was replaced two times before, Adam at least once during the 1993 Zoo tour in Australia. While Bono was in the hospital he was replaced by Chris Martin. So.. what's the big deal? This drummer Bram is insane, my guess is, he won't dissappoint. Larry will be back before the new album gets released in 2024. So don't read  more into this then it actually is man. No biggy.. And.. yes, the 90's showed U2 at their peak. Breaking new ground with fresh, innovative sounds that never get old. Most of their 80s stuff did get old. So it's obvious that new young fans are more drawn to U2's 90s sound then their 80s stuff. I still listen to U2's 90s work and almost never to their 80s work.
U2 sounds just like YouTube in your accent.
Hoping Larry can get back in business soon, but thinking of INXS when Michael Hutchence died, they copped a lot of flack for trying to continue with various new singers (and most of it was pretty crap), but what's to stop 5 life long mates from continuing to play music together? On the other hand Alice In Chains have managed to do brilliantly after the loss of 2 original members, including a much loved lead singer.
Seriously the most overrated band ever.
Some ChatGPT support on how to pronounce "Achtung".  (checked by a native German) :)   Start with the "ah" sound as in "father."   Pronounce the "ch" sound by exhaling sharply and making a sound similar to clearing your throat. This sound is made by moving the back of your tongue up towards the soft palate.   Next, add a short and crisp "t" sound immediately after the "ch" sound.   Finally, end with the "ung" sound, which is similar to the "oong" sound in "sung."   Putting it all together, the correct pronunciation of "Achtung" would be "ah-ch-toong".
Geez it’s their band. They can do what they like. People don’t like it…Don’t go 🤷‍♂️ I’d say Larry Mullen is ok with this.
Everyone is replaceable
That MSG Sphere would be a great venue for U2. I would consider going, in the past. But I didn’t know that Larry will not be part of it. That would be weird. I actually think they need to hang it up.
I saw U2 when they did the Joshua Tree tour, and they were fantastic.  It wouldn’t have been the same with a different drummer.  If they’re going to Vegas, they need to wait until the whole band can be there.
I agree. I love your channel
Achtung Baby was the first CD I ever bought back in 91 when I was 9 years old and I still have it today...  somehow.
Obviously this is a concert series for their slot machine fans who are losing their hearing and vision.
This is silly. They got a plum gig. They need a drummer. They got one. People might MARGINALLY care if Edge was gone. But I'll guaran-damn-tee you most U2 fans couldn't name the bassist and drummer. It's Bono that they want to see (those that still care). How many people know John Densmore? How many people know Nigel Olsen? D.J. Fontana? Clive Bunker? Ed Cassidy? Get my point?
What amazes me most is the fact that they don't patiently wait until Larry has recovered. I mean, why now, what's the hurry ? And you're right Rick, you don't replace your drummer of 47 years for the first time ever, unless there's something else going on. Maybe Larry has serious health issues. What also amazes me is that they are not open and honest about what's going on with him, which causes a lot of rumors and speculation.
Preach brother; couldn’t agree more!
Zero shot U2 took out the ad. James Dolan is up to his neck in this MSG Sphere project (hence why he fired two top execs on it this week). I can only imagine the money truck that was backed up to get U2 to play these shows and not to back out, down a man or not.
Amen Rick! I like you share the same U2 fandom. I agree completely on every end of the spectrum. REM went, but it's not the same and some bands are seamless in their approach, for example Pearl Jam and  Matt Cameron. What you nail is this, to a true U2 fan, hell yes this is not the direction you should go! Money grab and the peril of their legacy, just like Kiss and the fact their makeup is long over so for removal... maybe it's time for the Flu to put the shades away and own the fact their brand and empire is more important than some shows in cheesy ass Vegas! Awesome rant my fellow U2 lover and most innovative music channel hands down on YouTube! I really loved the rant, I think you should do a rant segment as a feature where you just go off the deep end like you're in one of those metal early 20th century scuba gear outfits, man that was awesome and I always thought of Achtung  Baby  & Joshua Tree the same way, as well as how you spoke to WAR and unforgettable fire, it's almost instinctively creepy, bono-vibes only a U2 fan could have. Their whole catalog from the beginning to Achtung Baby was this evolution your ears heard unfold from album to album, it was a true thing of beauty to be a part of that, in that time era. Sorry for the long post, you just made me remember why I love U2 so much.Maybe they will hear you're plea and we as fans can keep them from being scuzzy little Vegas street walkers! So Amen Reverend Beato, and keep preaching the good news!
I think I'm with you on this one Rick. They've made a few missteps, but I think this one will be a big one.  Health is important, and as another post mentions, LMJ's health may be not so great right now which is why they decided to move ahead. But this will be the "*" show/residency where everybody says, "it would've been even better if..." Overall, it sounds to me like an aging band lookin' for some of that 90's glory again. And that ad is just...silly and a bit creepy. They could've skipped the ad and lowered the ticket price of the shows. I'll pass.
Hyopcrits pretending to be annoyed when a band that's been going for 50 years replace their unwell drummer,when AC/DC and Journey are on their 15th or 27th lead singer or whatever.
No Larry=no U2!
Mrs Doubtfire n the boys minus Larry ,ride the gravy train again
Rick Beato I'd like to hear your opinion on the new Pantera. After hearing this rant it should be good. But I totally agree
I think Bun E Carlos is available
Shades of fat body suit Elvis...
I am so torn on this.  I want to agree with you so much, but I'm not sure I can say no to going.  I'm a long time fan that started out casual as a child but became a serious fan and AB is my favorite album. The Joshua Tree is fantastic and will always have a place in my heart, but there's something about Achtung Baby that still sounds modern 30+ years later. I've seen U2 5 times but without Larry is tough.   My understanding is that Larry can't play for now due to recovery from back surgery.  Part of me says don't play till he's healthy, but part of me says ow can you say no.  I'm afaid to find out how expensive tickets will be.
I am not even a U2 fan and I am thinking someone is not thinking about what they're doing.  I can see fan whiplash from this.
Dude, U2 made millions from that Apple iTune thingy ..Singers and guitar players are all folk care about...
The “where are they now” tour…. If the drummer is in no shape to do the gigs, they’re playing for the hubristic indulgence of the singer.
Atchung, Azov Baby...U2 support Nazis.
Las Vegas residency?!!!! A complete sellout!
Maybe Larry just didn't want to play in a fixed Vegas venue.
Dear Rick, i love U2 but i hate Bono. The guy is just a big greedy A-hole. He wont ever have enough. So if the original drummer cant come they will get another.
If Larry isn it in, then it's time to hang it up. Had a good run. Let it go. Everything has a shelf life
U2 played at The City Limits in East Syracuse NY in 81 I think. It was the Boy Tour. Man those were the days. My first, without my parents, was Aerosmith. It was the Draw the Line tour in 78. Tickets cost $6. Minimum wage $4. All I had to do was work one hour and a half. Wonder how many hours that kid will have to put in for the LV show.
I'm ready for the the hate but here I go...  Love U2.  Not in love with anything they put out after Joshua Tree.  For me; War, October, Boy,  Under a Blood Red Sky and Joshua Tree are the "must" have U2.  But I digress...  Most of the bands that I like are old.  The lineups have changed.  It sucks that we can't see the original act but sometimes we have to roll with it.  Better than Rihanna's lip sync in any event.
BUT, are they BETTER THAN EZRA??????
U carnt replace Larry
It’s not U2, it’s U.75. I also find the ad hard to believe. Great album, but it’s not the single album that I’m having withdrawal symptoms to experience live. Especially not at 75%.
Zooropa doesn't get the love it deserves.
I’ve heard the new recording of Pride…why mess with something that didn’t need any changes. The new version isn’t remotely close to the original.  This new album worries me.
irrelevancy
larry mullen is the beating heart of u2, they are famous,are on the top, they dont need to do that with out larry, maybe its fear, look what they are doing today with they classics song.....im a u2 fan, love the edge, but i dont now what its happend, maybe the are lookig outside ...whe they need to look inside.
Apparently, they need to pay the bills...
As far as the Super Bowl ad and the long form video that conspicuously erased U2’s extremely large fan base consisting of middle-aged women while highlighting an older man, I’ve long said that U2’s coms team is a disaster. But, as a fan since I was aged 7 in the 1980s, I would never diminish the importance of Larry’s contributions, and yet am still excited about these Vegas shows. Larry’s absence will be felt, but I’m still expecting a phenomenal show, like every other live show I’ve seen. I’m planning to take my kids to his show, and as all 4 of U2’s members get older, their ability to ever play again is not a given. I’m smelling the flowers while I can, praying for Larry’s recovery, and being grateful anytime I get to experience the joy of U2 in whole or in part. And since there isn’t any reason to think Larry has a problem with any of this, I’m not on board with the folks that think boycotting U2 is somehow a way to stand up for Larry or the band they claim to love.
AC/DC replaced Malcomb.
Many an ill-advised venture starts out with the optimistic words "I have a good idea!"  Posting a list of such undertakings would be endless, and there is a high probability that, with the human condition being what it is, there will be many more to come.
Perhaps for this Vegas run, they should bill themselves as U -1.
I was three when AB came out. I'd love to get the chance to get a little bit of the ZooTV experience. I don't see anyone else doing anything even remotely close to that experience anymore. I gather the sphere is supposed to be an excellent audio/visual venue - has to be better than the acoustical mess that is a stadium tour. I'll take what I can get.
I bought Chicago tickets last summer only to discover, no Walter Parazaider. The venue was 10 minutes from my house and I sold my tickets.
You gotta appreciate it for what it is.  I'd rather see U2 minus 1 than no U2.  I'd rather see Paul and Ringo without John and George than no Beatles.  I'd rather see Roger Waters and Dave Gilmour without Rick Wright than no Pink Floyd.  Enjoy what you can get these guys wont be around much longer
I have an idea of what could work and everybody's happy, except the fill-in guy! Get a hold of the multi-track masters from the original sessions. Make loops out of them, most of them were loops anyway. Have the boys just play to the right loops triggered live at the right time. It's still Larry who played that stuff. Have no drummer on stage, well maybe a fake dummy Larry with a screen for a head. Once every show real Larry calls in to that TV head from bed or whatever and tells the audience he gives the band permission to go on. Larry still gets paid as if he played and all the fans would know that. I think it would actually warm ppls hearts and no one would be mad about not having the drummer that time. What do you think?
I wore out my VHS tape of U2 in Sydney.  And forgot about the song ‘Dirty Day’.  What a forgotten classic.
Huge U2 fan, but you make a valid point
I would most definitely not go to a  U2 concert without all of the original members..
you 3 should diet so your not huge U2 fans its unhealthy
Bono, the Edge and Adam Clayton will be joined by drummer Bram van den Berg, who will be sitting at the kit instead of founding member Larry Mullen Jr. as the latter takes “time out to undergo and recuperate from surgery in 2023,” the band said in a statement.
Let the free market decide whether or not this arrangement is a good idea. Who are we to speculate?
Right on Rick.
When Bono needed back surgery years ago, they canceled their shows and rescheduled them (meaning that I couldn't go to the replacement show, but...). Now that Larry needs surgery, they're just playing without him. It's a shame.
Drummers are (unfortunately) expendable. Examples of this are abundant.
I don’t see the blunder at all. People pay thousands of dollars to see Paul McCartney barely duet his way through I’ve Got a Feeling with the Let it Be footage of John Lennon, who’s been dead for 43 years…. U2 hasn’t performed since before the pandemic. And I can attest that my wife is 29 years old- I got her into Achtung Baby (now her favorite u2 album) and was just asking me if we should try to get tickets. Seeing the cryptic ad during the Super Bowl was totally unexpected and very intriguing. Also, what about the weird synchronicity with the Chinese balloon and reports of UFOs…? It’s all mysterious and weird, which is…. Kinda cool?
They played gigs without Bono!I hope Larry is OK 👍
What, Jimmy Nicol wasn’t available?
Rick, is there a musician or band you aren't a "Fan Of"? I'm not a fan of U2. Their sound is "noisy". Be honest with us and let us know.
"This kid who's 32..."  Hooboy, Rick. Showed your age. 🤣
U2's drummer Larry Mullen Jr. has ruled himself out of touring with U2 next year due to ongoing physical health issues. The 61-year-old sticksman explained that he requires surgery after injuring his “elbows, knees [and] neck", and should Bono and co decide to hit the road in 2023, he won't be joining them.Dec 6, 2022
After the Vegas show they will tour with Larry
I love your channel, but I don't understand this take... a band of 60+ year old guys can't replace their drummer who needs surgery and recovery for a dozen shows?  He's not leaving the band, all indication is he's perfectly onboard with this (and may show up in some shows)... A tribute band re-starts Pantera and people think it's amazing, but U2 can't use a different guy for a few shows?  Sure, we'd love to see all four, but their getting older, things happen... and technically they have done shows already missing someone before.  It's also a dream come true for the replacement to play with them for a few months, that's a great story too... oh well, fewer people to compete against for tickets, I'm fine with that.
Great points, Rick. If you're not going to play with the full band AND you don't have new songs, what's the point of a residency? Let's face it; their best years are behind them. A graceful retirement would be the best move for all of them.
Are you trying to say that some of the members of U2 aren't really that smart?
Am I the only person that doesn't find U2  appealing or interesting at all?  The incredible narcissism and egotism of a musician to call himself "The Edge" I find bizarre and incredibly self indulgent.  I think that they're boring and uninteresting.  Listen to the Ramones,  John Lydon,  PIL  and Bowie instead.  Want to hear some other great drummers listen to  Will Calhoun of Living Color and Carter Beauford of the Dave Matthews Bamd or the best drummer in the world,..Dave Weckl with anyone.
I think maybe they are looking for that which they had once found but since lost...
Hardly seems fair to expect that a band can only perform live providing that all original members are on stage. Why should the illness or death of one member dictate the end of everyone else's passion and career?  Ticket sales will reveal how people feel about it anyway.  Hopefully Larry is able to heal up well and get behind the kit again soon.  His drumming is unique and is an important part of the U2 sound!
U2 is the most overrated band ever. I still haven't found a reason why I should like it.
That U2 download was strange.  Couldn't they wait?
People want to hear the original and authentic sound of U2. That sound is defined, embodied, by the masterful guitar playing of The Edge, the always flawless, rich vocals of Bono - and by one of the best musicians ever to sit behind a drum kit. Perhaps the best rock drummer ever. Larry Mullen Jr. End of. Mic drop. Feedback cutting through the silence...
We can at least be grateful that it's not Dave Grohl sitting in on drums!  :p
Begins to sound (to me) a little like what Townshend drags around, pretending it's The Who, only without Moon or Entwistle. Come to think of it, are Mick and Keith pretending that you can replace Charlie? At least Zeppelin had the taste to toss in the towel after Bonham died. Others' mileage may vary, of course.
a U2 vegas residency proves the band has entered the "snowbird in florida" stage of their lives, in rockstar terms. They have nothing to prove, catalogs of music they can play, and people willing to pay sums of money to see them do it. They are past the point of trying to prove legitimacy. They are in the "dahling another perrier please before I hit the stage" phase. uuugh. And outside of Edge's guitar playing, are noticeably dull. (Hot take I know, I own it)
Incredibly disappointing.  I wish they would disclose all the facts.
Maybe the initiative is all in service to Larry’s good health and escalating costs of medical costs and time associated with healing. Sometimes even the most dedicated of musicians need a break. :) What’s a year in the big scheme of things. The band’s legacy has already been made. ❤️
I fail to see the need for outrage. I'm confident that most in the target audience couldn't name the drummer, if asked.  In fact, I wasn't even aware that Anthony Bourdain was in the band until I saw your thumbnail.
Right on, Rick. You nailed it. I went from elation when I saw the ad to being annoyed and angry when I found out it was a cash grab with no artistic integrity.
You tell 'em Rick!! Maybe get Larry on an interview??
It's TEMPORARY, Rick...only until Larry recovers from his surgery that he already had, my guess is this gig was already booked BEFORE the surgery and U2 is the first act to play the Las Vegas Sphere, they are the inaugural performers.  You know every show will sell out regardless.
Wouldn't want to see U2 without Larry. It's that simple.
Yeah ! Like Rick said . . .
Rick, right on with your commentary.  I'm a lifelong lover of original rock (like you, I'm 60 too).  U2 risks being labeled as frauds and money grubbing old rockers if they really go through with this.  Seriously?  Vegas?! Gimme a break.
You nailed it Rick.
The Rattle And Hum record wasn’t a misstep in my opinion. It was a solid album and the movie is incredible.
They haven't done a show in 5 years, unless Larry has a really bad health condition, I think they should wait a couple months for him
Maybe they'll get Jimmy Nicol. It is because in the age of transparency, they'd better say Larry ain't going to be there first, otherwise the optics would look bad if they didn't mention it and went on without Larry shocking the fans at the gig.  Adam also missed a gig during their Sydney show on the Zoomerang tour. Maybe this is in tribute of that. At the next one, Edge could sit it out.
This is  how i feel on GNR touring  without Izzy and Steven;Aerosmith without  Joey Kramer -----------------------This is why  the Led Zeppelin are the most legendary group- no Bonzo - no shows,no money grab
Weird. So weird.
1) I honestly think Achtung Baby is the most important album since Dark Side of the Moon. 2) I'm guessing there is a reason why Larry Mullen Jr is sitting this out. And while I agree he is important to the band it wouldn't stop me from going, if the Edge or Bono were out that would.
Well said. Big U2 fan but this stinks. Lost a lot of respect for them.
Sigh... Rick, music is more than art. In it's commercial form it's a product. Like other commercial products, it's meant to generate revenue. Who effing cares if U2 decides to or needs to go out and earn more money? They remind me of Roger Waters, full of themselves and willing to milk their cash cow for all they can. Don't like it? don't pay and go to the shows but you know as well as I do, you will seek and watch videos of it to have something to piss and moan about. Get over it.
It's fun to play to people who want to hear you. They have a following. If they wait for the drummer it might never happen.
With Bono's recent book, "Surrender" out, which was really good, by the way, it's obvious that the band has never really been Larry Mullen Jr.'s anyway, he just happens to be the guy who put the advert out there. That said, I think the band does whatever Bono wants. I've never gone to see a band without the original lineup. I wouldn't pay the exorbitant prices they command without the original lineup. A lot of the cheesy 80's rockers and their iterations of the original almost always seem insincere (and that's my era). Newer fans will show because they don't know who Larry Mullen Jr. Fans are anyway, or Edge, or Adam Clayton. They won't have a problem getting their money in the over-glossed, schmaltzy Las Vegas. Most lifelong fans will wait for the tour.
They sold out after Joshua Tree
100% U2 sold out long ago.
I'm assuming none of them have had a recent divorce, so I don't think it's a money grab. Bono's NOT poor. (How do they split songwriting credits/royalties?) I'd assume this really is them just wanting to get out and play. So let them play. They're musicians.
So I wondered as I listened to this, (and you may have done this already) what did you think of the Stones with Watts and Steve Jordan.
well, for the record, The Police could still be out there kickling ass, if not for the issue of them kicking each other's asses first.
I was lucky enough to see the Zoo tour at Wembley Stadium in 1993 with Bjork, Stereo Mc's and Paul Oakenfold supporting. Me and a friend got in the cage, second row from the front right in front of Edge. It was incredible, in my top five gigs of all time. That was the first time i saw them and I've seen them five times since, including The Joshua Tree anniversary show at Twickenham Stadium. It saddens me in a way, I've been listening to them since 1983, i just hope Larry's ok and the four of them produce another groundbreaking original record. The experimental rock records of the 90's was their peak for me.
I've been a fan since 2000 (I'm 32). My favourite album is not ATYCLB, or No line on the horizon, it's Achtung Baby so here you have an example of someone that was just a toddler when It came out but it's still my favourite. I would sell some of my organs if there was a time machine so that I could see a real ZooTv show back in 92-93.  That being said I agree with everything you say regarding the band's decision to play Vegas, in the first place, and even worse, without one of its members.
They are good.  A one trick pony that has made it for so long must remain the same.
U2 should of definitely went independent it didn't hurt Nine inch nails and Radiohead . Songs of Surrender is horrendous by U2's standards I record at home by myself and have a better recording quality then this. The corporate influence is destroying U2
I would not go see them without Larry and them doing it without him is Mega Douchey
Bono is greedy and wants his money
Et tu, U2?
Bono spent whole life trying to stay relevant… why he's doing this
I think they had agreed to do the gig before the surgery… and didn’t want to pass on this big new opportunity. This venue is supposed to be transcendent. Hopefully they’ll end up there again with Larry in the future.
I really fancy this show, Achtung Baby is definitely U2's best period, and the ZooTV outdoor shows were the pinnacle of live performance as far as I'm concerned. But not waiting until Larry's healed is a misstep by U2. Larry is integral to the band. Anyone can play Larry's parts, but only Larry plays like Larry. Bad move.  EDIT: To be fair, this isn't the first gig U2 have done without a longtime member, Adam missed the first Sydney gig on the ZooTV tour due to an apparently horrendous hangover. But a whole residency is definitely a mistake.
2:55 False. During the Zoo TV tour (that's what it was called), Adam missed one of their Sydney shows. Granted, that was because Adam was locked in his room and his bass tech had to fill in THAT night.   But enough with this "Why is U2 doing this" bullshit. Have you stopped to think what LARRY wanted? What has HE said about it? I'm willing to bet he's the guy who gave the green light to this. But no, too many people are too selfish to wonder what Larry wants.  If LARRY wants this, then it should happen. If fans aren't happy about HIS decision, well, they can stay the fuck home.  How you didn't already know about Larry's need for surgery (which will set him on the sidelines for a year in recovery) makes me wonder how much you've been keeping up with U2. I've known for a while now.  As for 2014, that was new management's blunder.
They didn't put the album on everyone's device, they put the metadata on to allow you to add it to your library. It took up like, 32kb, but scores of people thought that their precious drive space was being filled up.
100%
l just think you are hot under the collar because this was/is a stable rock and roll quartet. A lot of these cats, playing live and recording is all they know how to do. Or all they love to do. When John Bonham died, Led Zep announced publicly that this was it. Over. Done. On the other side, Molly Hatchet played recently at a venue close by here with ZERO original members. l cannot judge in any of these examples.
I'm a diehard U2 fan and have been since the mid to late 90's. I honestly wish U2 had packed it in 10 years ago, just to consolidate their legacy. The last few years have just seemed a bit desperate to stay relative, which they just aren't anymore.I don't know, I stilll love them but it's all a bit embarrasing to see them doing their old stuff whle they're in their 60s.
If you can use the bass tech for a global pay per view with a few hours notice, you can do a Vegas residency with a pro drummer fill-in.
It's like seeing the Stones without Charlie, or AC/DC without Brian, or the Little River Band without anyone! Steve Jordan and Axel Rose clearly had great respect for the position they were in and they both did an amazing job, but it's just never better than the real thing.. CHILD!!!
Managers will fuck things up so fast. The relationship between an artist and their manager is so important. And U2 really picked poorly.
I don't see this as a big deal. The show was planned ages ago before Larry had need for extensive surgery with a long recovery based on what I had read. Contracts need to be honored and if the show is a success and runs long Larry could return to close out the show.  Achtung Baby is the culmination of the great trilogy U2 started with The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree. R&H is, IMO, just a side project. AB is one of my favorite all time U2 albums. It's timeless.
Stupid take Beato
Achtung Baby and Joshua Tree 2 Greatest Albums of Alltime. And Zoo Tv Tour the greatest live tour ever.
0:52 "...my buddy rich... So fitting, as this clip is also about a drummer :-P
I have actually been thinking Bono should try a solo album.
I get it. However these guys are really OLD.
Time, gentlemen, please! Have the good grace to stop bothering us at last. If only the great Brian Eno hadn’t revived your career by producing that tree thingummyjig, rather than concentrating on his own wonderful music, we’d all have been a lot happier. Anyway, hope you’re OK, Larry.
I feel the same about those guys calling themselves Yes these days.
Rick, I think there might be more to this than meets the eye here.... They've been talking about this for a while now and I think Larry was always meant to be there. But at some point (probably after they finished working on Songs of Surrender) it turns out he needed surgery. He talked about it when they got the Kennedy Center Honors, check out that video online, the thing abut that video is that the way Larry talks abut doing the surgery and taking a break to take care of his body almost sounds like he has the choice of not doing it now but he decided not to delay it. SO I think it's possible he is doing this now so by the time they're ready to work on their new album he is back in shape OR.... because he doesn't want to do a Vegas residency. Check out this quote from him from 2013: “I can’t see myself in Las Vegas at age 65. If U2 still makes music that is relevant I’ll be more than happy and proud to tour that music. But if it turns out that that is something the band will not do then I’m more than happy to direct a movie or act in a movie.” So it MIGHT be that he is not joining on purpose. Again back on the Kennedy Center Honors thing the way he talks about it is suspicious. After all, if these physical issues have been lingering for a long while (as he alludes to on that video) then why did he not take care of them during covid when he had all the time in the world and U2 was not working....? Like I said, I think there's more behind this than we know right now.   PS: It was my dream to see U2 do another ZooTV, but Larry not being there is really sad.
Like everything in this world, money talks. It's always about the money
It's gonna flop !
@3:40 Did you mean "U2"? I guess you're used to ranting about YouTube...
It is kind of interesting to me actually. It doesn't sound like Larry Mullen is upset about it either. It will be interesting to see how they do.
My favorite band of all time is Rush.  I'm so glad I got to see them on their R40 tour.  The last one.  If they ever sold a show as Rush without Neil, they would lose me as a fan.  But I don't think they would.  I was never a big Led Zep fan, but I respect what they did when John died. "The band no longer exists."  But those are times when the drummer has died.  Larry is still alive.  And don't give me this "the fans want to see it" BS.  That's why KISS is still on the road 22 years after I saw them on their "farewell" tour!
Well, Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney stay also for a Long time... U2 until the end of the World
U2 are a walking dead group since first years of 2000 ... I loved them in my youth until Achtung Baby came out: a big disappointment and I didn't want to listen to them since How to Dismantle .... quite a few good songs but after that again disappeared. It's obvious they are still there for the money, maybe Larry Mullen can't stand with these things and want to stay away from this slow musical dead
Larry has shoulder issues from carrying the band.  Bono’s ego needs a few more hundred million.
It was a billion dollar deal to open the Sphere. I'm pretty sure they had to go for it.
I still say Boy is my favorite album
Money Talks, BS Walks. Simple as.
I'm wondering if a bunch of this wasn't already in motion before they knew he was going to have to have a surgery and wouldn't be able to play. If they'd already signed a bunch of contracts, it might be difficult or expensive to back out of it.
I think they are betraying their principles. Going against their very essence. Big mistake. You cannot return back from that.
Money Money Money!!!
100% accurate & smart opinion. I do agree for sure!
Larry's work on Joshua Tree, in particular One Tree Hill, speaks for what a great drummer he is
It's not going to work without that tension between The Edges' guitar delays fighting at times with Larrys drums and Adam's pumping bass .....I'll just watch Rattle and Hum thankyou ...
I'm sorry but if I'm not mistaken.... Bun E Carlos isn't playing with Cheap Trick anymore and he was the greatest... and Joey Kramer was once not playing with Aerosmith but he eventually came back to the band.... same thing applies here! It's like The Beatles without Ringo... come now ... really?!
Sorry mate,not my cup of tea 🥱
Adam missed one show during the Australian leg of the AB tour. he had his bass techie fill in for him. but that was spur of the moment. he had a debilitating hangover. he quite drinking by the end of the tour and has been clean&sober ever since.
Like The OJays said " For Love ( greed) Of Money " 💰! Not a good idea but.... anything to make A Buck huh? Sad because I'm a Drummer and I would feel " left out "!
Longtime U2 fan - first tour I saw was The Unforgettable Fire, have never missed one since. Achtung Baby is my fave album, always in my top 3 "desert island records" and the ZooTv is and always be my fave tour ever by any artist. (Preferred indoor broadcasts, but the scale of the outside shows was truly a spectacle to behold) I've seen them 74 times and really REALLY REALLY want to see "So Cruel" live. Is it worth flying to Vegas for that one song? Does it even count if Larry's not  behind the drum kit? Will I have to take out a second mortgage and / or sell some organs to be able to afford the tickets / hotels and flights? I know that FOMO is going to kick in and I will want to see this, but I am really put off by the way this was announced (even though we still don't have any dates). As I recall, this is not their first SB related announcement - I believe it was the song "Invisible" that debuted during a Superbowl.
Hey Rick, I don't comment very often, but this time I feel inclined to. You'll probably not read this, although I hope you do.  First of all: I totally get where you're coming from. Although I was born in '89 and don't listen to U2 very often these days, I grew up with and have loved their music. And as with most bands, I prefer the original line-ups.  But as someone from the Netherlands, it's a big deal and very cool to see someone as Bram van den Berg getting such a prolific gig. He's a great drummer and a nice guy, who's has done some awesome stuff here in the Netherlands. Getting to fill in for U2 is a huge deal for the Dutch music scene. You won't feel that sentiment like I do, but it's a pity you overlook the fact that a drummer who's unknown to most of the world gets such a great gig and just shrug him off as "some fill in drummer". I get there is an angry story from your side, but the positive story of the underdog musician getting the gig gets overlooked.  And we're missing context. Maybe Larry Mullen Jr. wanted this. If I were unable to play for some reason, I wouldn't want my band to stop working in the meantime. Like Dusty Hill wanted his guitar tech to take over bass duties. And if this is what he wants for the band, who are we to tell him he's wrong?  Once again, totally get where you're coming from, but I think there's a lot more to this 🙂
3:38 YouTube‘s manager?
Achtung Baby is their near perfect masterpiece. Saw the ZooTV tour at Yankee Stadium. The first time I heard 'One' live, I openly wept. The lyrics, the sunflowers, the buffalo falling off the cliff...speechless. I can't vision anyone else behind the drum kit other than Larry. But if tickets aren't in the Taylor Swift range, I'll be there.
LMJ : Sorry guys, don't think I can make it. New Manager : I'm fine, with or without you.
The Joshua Tree is easily one of the greatest albums in rock history.
This one feels like another "Old man yells at cloud" moment from Rick. U2 is playing a big show, without their drummer. To promote the big show they put out a 15 second spot during the biggest advertising window of the year. U2 have been a big band for this long in no small part because they put on amazing shows like this. It sucks that Larry won't be a part of those shows, but I don't see it as being a huge deal. I'm 35 years old, a U2 fan since "Beautiful Day" came on the radio, and to me The Edge is the defining element of the band.
U2 - Derivative, over rated, boring, uninteresting , full of themselves, polarizing
Larry is U2's secret weapon.  This was dissapointing.  I know, likely they are under threat of not being the first act at The Sphere (maybe Foo Fighters would take their place?).  Here's the thing, being the first band to open this venue is a cool, no doubt, but who's going to care in a week who opened this effin' venue?!?!
Not a U2 fan, but has Larry issued a statement.  The only thing I can find is a statement from the band that indicates Larry is cool with it.  If Larry is indeed cool with it then the band isn't doing shady things.
U2 = no big deal. Just my opinion, but I would love it if they just went away.
Don’t worry the The Dutch drummer Will do fine believe me.🇳🇱🥁👌
10/10 Rant
The drummer that is filling in for Larry, studied music in my hometown; Tilburg. Also known as Tilly, Tillywood❤️ He plays in one of the coolest bands in The Netherlands, Krezip. We Dutchies find the news epic but also hilarious. I mean Tilburg, Holland and U2. Come on🙅‍♀️  I also had the great honor to interview Adam Clayton. Looking back at that lovely and calming afternoon. I think U2 is absolutely okay with Bram from The Netherlands😬
It's totally a money thing! U2 is my favorite band ever, and achtung baby is my favorite album ever! Bono is a pretentious ass, who is so fake, and goes on conjecture instead of facts! He will knock Trump, which is his right, but sits a the most racist president ever, at the state of the union, Joe biden! No Larry, no u2! Southpark may have called ot right. Bono the biggest #2 ever!
i agree with you 100% without Larry it's not U2
i was at the 2006 aloha stadium show ! it was great
Spot on, Rick
Check out Crown Lands Starlifter Paisano
I stopped listening to U2 when Achtung Baby dropped, that was the time when U2 started to sound like A-ha and A-ha made a good record
I agree with Rick, but you just know that this gig is in America because all those seats will be filled. Some soul fans but mainly place- holders. I think surely the fact that they have even gone for a corpulent LV residency says it all?  Long gone driving up a down a freeway to rough bar gigs and fair enougj  without even a roadie. The ultimate sellimg-out. Whatever Bono might moralise
Let me get this right: Larry Mullen Jr is like your Buddy Rich??  😉
Perhaps if they call the band U3 ?       :)
I thought the rant would be about their rehashing of their original songs. As much as I love U2, I don't really like how all of their new songs sound like basic pop music. The whole thrill of U2 is how incredibly inventive all of their music is, but now it's just very basic and bland. The rehashing of the really good, older songs into basic pop is just saddening me tbh.
With or without you has new meaning.
Larry can't make the Vegas dates because he'll be recovering from back surgery. Sheesh - show some compassion!
Let's see what they sound like before passing judgement; conversely, they could rename themselves, U2 II?
I think it's probably exactly as reported with zero sinister undertones. Mullen is the sound of U2, but life gets in the way sometimes.
Rick you rule , but as an old musician (gawd too old) I have to repeat what was explained to me 30 years ago.... "NEVER..EVER cancel a gig for a drummer". Always thought that was profound,  cruel, accurate and Hilarious. Remember when Ringo got laryngitis.? just sayin
Amen Rick! U2 are in my top 10 favorite bands of all time. But sone of their decisions baffle me.
I love your commentary Rick. Your sentiments are right on.
Boy, I really respected when John Paul, Robert, and Jimmy said, "We lost our drummer. We're done." A bustle in your hedgerow indeed.   Peace out from Taipei
Love the passion and totally agree with you. Wtf are they thinking🤦‍♂️
Yeah - they should have hung up the shingles in early 2000's... Alternatively they could have become Radiohead and pushed into genuinely new experiments. Perhaps they weren't capable of that?  Does Bono need to stay on stage to push ageing globalist agendas? Getting a bit sad looking at this point...
I also don't get what you're upset about.  AC/DC had a bunch of guest singers recently....other groups have replaced people due to health reasons.  U2 is my favourite band and it's sad Larry can't continue but don't you think he's telling them to go on without him?
We don’t know if Larry’s medical issues are something more, hope not!
Larry had major arthritis from what I understand, or hand pain brought on by playing drums for 40 years.  This could be why he can't play?
As was stated in your conversation with Pat Metheny, the drummer drives the bus, so to speak. Zeppelin without John Bonham would have been some other band entirely. U2 billing themselves as U2 without Larry is false advertising.
Dude!! That Veteran’s stadium show was my first concert back when I was a freshman in high school — changed my life!  I’m a full time professional musician today.
When will U2 be putting on the Make UP 😑
I loved Vertigo. I thought that the Edge was great. Influenced by Andy Summers , bring it to the next level without the knowledge. No Edge, no U2. The rest is, as they say, futile. Sunday bloody Sunday without the Edge ? Larry Mullens got very lucky, a bit like the Beatles. The probability of getting 4 geniuses in the same neighbourhood is slim.
saw them front row at Soldier Field 6/28/97 on the Pop Mart Tour...changed my life.  I can't imagine them without Larry behind the kit.
Hahah I love the rants
If this was new music being created for a new album while Larry is in recovery I could understand the problem but it isn’t. I do hope that they go for traditional arrangements however and I really want to see Bono as the Fly once more.
100% agreed. I must go even further... I'm not sure they got new fans, specially with their latest offering. Being a massive U2 fan myself (AB and Zoo TV are the most incredible album and tour), I don't recognise my favorite band anymore...
Larry has spinal problems. So do I. Guess what I did? Got another guitarist to “fill in” the parts I can’t play. He’s awesome.Granted I’m a spec of dust but good grief Beato is missing the or a point. Pain makes you…bizarre. And they likely signed the Vegas contracts long ago. Back to pain. You think you’re playing in time, then listen back (pun intended) and it’s like I’m a beginner. Years of physical therapy. Literally years. If anything I feel bad (pun intended) for Adam, Edge and Bono. They’re already paid to open the new arena but they have to play without their drummer. If you hadn’t noticed at least Adam and Bono head organizations that help people. I met Adam by accident. He was incredible kind and seemed like that nice guy you run into at work. Watching someone you love suffer just sucks. This rant is backwards.
Although this is a dumb move on their part when people say U2 is overrated, they just shoe how stupid and/or ignorant they are. Right up there with idiot speak saying Hendrix or the Beatles were overrated.
I’m not a fan, never was. I will not ever be. For every decent song, there’s a story about complete idiocy.
So apparently a drummer can be replaced.But the new management should maybe think about the future and use this opportunity to also replace the singer like Queen did? To make the impossible ... possible?  Maybe the Coldplay guy Chris Martin? Fuck it! maybe Coldplay should just play Achtung Baby? Win win win!
I whole heartedly agree. The iTunes thing was a disaster, when I saw the ad, my wife was like; "Achtung Baby?? Didn't they already release that album?" We had no idea what it was for until this video. Like you, I've been a fan since 1980 when "Boy" came out. It blew my mind, especially since as an 18 year old, the band members were within a year or two in age to myself. I saw them in 1988 at the old Boston Garden and again in the mid 90's at Gillette Stadium (Home of the NE Patriots). I get the whole Las Vegas residency thing, since many bands are doing it, but wait until Larry is well and can join, and let's not just do Achtung Baby shall we?
I couldn't disagree with you more on this Rick. You make a lot of false assumptions here. You are not as knowledgeable of a U2 fan or of the U2 fan base as you think you are. Lets make a video together and I will explain why. Other than that, love your channel keep up the great work.
Hmm... Will U2 fans turn up? Maybe...  Some will be so disgusted they won't. Others will think, better something than nothing?
U2 is garbage…with their WEF clown fanboy Bono
I went to see Japan in 1982 (London, Hammersmith Odeon). They had Masami Tsuchiya from Ippu-Do, and he totally ruined it. Different scenario but same effect!
Daryl Jones seemed to do a pretty good job replacing Bill Wyman then there’s Pino replacing John Entwistle.. oh yes then Abe Laboriel Jnr doing a bang up job replacing Ringo..this is a dep job and I’m sure he’ll be very good.  The sky’s not actually falling in ffs
Larrys having a procedure done.  He'll be back.  Since it's a residency most likely he'll even return to do that.
I haven’t missed a concert since 1987. U2 has changed Bono has no voice and now they’re playing without Larry?? I’m done with U2. Larry is U2
You're dogging their choice of marketing? Why? The Sphere is an extraordinary venue, and these guys are in their 60s for crying out loud. There is a limited time before The Sphere becomes just another venue, and the space is perfect for Achtung Baby. (You can make an argument for Zooropa, but the songs just aren't as well known.) Who wants to go back on the road? Are you assuming they didn't ask Larry if he was cool with it? Or that he wouldn't get a cut? What do you take them for?  I love ya, Rick, but take a step back. You say bands don't replace members and then advertise at the big game. Okay... bands don't advertise on the Super Bowl, AT ALL. If it's in the budget, why the hell not?! It's U2. Super Bowl ad is on brand.
It's all about the money and maybe, just maybe a desire to get back out there and do their thing. Performers as you well know, love to perform. My band and I were never a big deal but I still miss performing in little bars, clubs, festivals, shelter houses, heck even outhouses ;-) ... I agree that performing as U2 without Larry Mullen feels like a lie. If there is anything redeeming it's that they at least say that Mullen will not be with them at the outset. Ticket buyers in that case should know what they are getting. I'm not sure how they should have promoted it and yeah, promoting as U2 will obviously bring in the most money but they should have promoted it as Bono, The Edge and Adam Clayton. Bono/Edge/Clayton? BEC? They also shouldn't be doing that album without Mullen, since as you said, he was the driving force behind that album. Drum grooves on Joshua Tree are fantastic but as you said, Achtung Baby has Larry Mullen Jr's fingerprints, err drumprints all over it.
I could never stand U2. For me is the most overrated band in rock history. Don't like his songs, don't like their album productions and I hate Edge's guitar sound
Stinks yes, and while I don't agree with it... it is not without precedent. During the "Zoomerang" leg of the Zoo TV Tour Adam got so drunk that he was replaced for one night by Stuart Morgan, Adam's bass tech.
Why didn’t they just reschedule after he recovers from surgery, do they need money that bad?
Love seeing people publicly saying they love U2, they get a ton of undeserved hate cuz it’s trendy to hate them. Fans need to stick up for them more often.
Bonos ego has ballooned higher than the chinese spy balloons
U2’s been terribly managed for like 10+ years. They’re prob contractually required to play Vegas without Larry but he’s had these health issues for a while, they should’ve seen it coming. PLEASE get new management.
I smiled when you mentioned Wide Awake In America. Loved getting that as a time filler before The Joshua Tree dropped. Always hoped for a full live album from The Unforgettable Fire tour. Daniel Lanois and Eno were a great team and took them in an interesting new direction.
Once upon a time I liked their WAR album and Joshua Tree. Now I'm sick of U2. Sick of Bono. Sick of their pretentious marketing moves.
positive side: Dutch drummer Bram van den Berg will soon play in the best U2 cover band there is....
U2 have spoilt us by staying together as long as they have.
u2 moves in mysterious ways.
This is a bunch of BS. Springsteen replaced his drummer Max Weinberg with his son for a tour and Little Steven with Tom Morello because they had other obligations. The Beatles replaced an ill Ringo for another drummer during a EU tour in 1964. And remember when Van Halen replaced their lead singer and actually became a better band because of it. There's tons of examples, the show must go on!
Now I even appreciatie you even more Rick and U2 a bit less. It really takes courage to make this statement being such an influential voice as you are. You are so right in this matter. The music of U2 and the band itself stands for faith, hold on  to your principes and beliefs. Stick together etc. What wil be next, a stand in for Bono?
I don't think this signals the end of Larry as a member of U2, nor do I think this diminishes the pivotal role Larry has played in the band since forming U2. While the performances won't be the same without Larry, I think a Vegas residency is the perfect venue for 3/4U2. If they were touring the world without Larry, then I would have a problem with this, but under these circumstances, I wish them well.  Come on... it's Vegas, where everything is glitzy and overdone, it's not like they are playing The Royal Alberta Hall.
Rick, if the band wants to do it and Larry is not suing their asses, then I'm all for them going to Vegas. Larry will get his check just the same. I'm sure it's not about money because God knows they are out of money! They want to do it because they like playing live. Bob, Dylan at 81 plus years old is still touring the world. God bless him for it too! I saw him in 2019 and he was kick ass!
Seriously, there are people that don't like Rattle and Hum? That's a classic.
Without Larry Mullen Jr. it’s not U2! If I would be in the situation that I could attend these shows I wouldn’t go as long as Larry isn’t playing. I am curious how the ticket selling is going for the shows without him.
Absolutely right
thats funny, their ex manager paul mcguinness was always the fifth member of the band, followed by Daniel Lanois
From what I understand Larry has given his blessing for the band to play with a stand in drummer.
I think you nailed the key issue, U2 is U2, with the 4 original members.
Our aging music heroes have to adjust in the new music industry climate, they do weird things. Tone def marketing people, who think they are hip, but show their stupidity.  I last saw U2 in Minneapolis in 2017, it was a great concert.
U2 has been gross & forced upon the public my entire life..
This may have already been stated in the currently 3400+ comments but, Larry Mullen Jr. stated last year (Dec. 2022) that if U2 decided to do any dates in 2023 that he would not do it. to quote him in an interview from The Washington Post "My body is not what it used to be physically. Like next year, I won’t be performing live next year. I don’t know what the band’s plan is. There’s talk of all kinds of things." So, yeah the Super bowl ad was something to wonder WHY? but, it is Larry's choice not to play the dates. That really shouldn't hold the other guys back.
I love Rick´s rants. It´s pure passion. By the way: when legends start to perform in Vegas, this is mostly the beginning of the end. Just my 2 percent.
Separate request:  Please do a video on SRV's tone.  It's one of the more hotly debated topics among guitarists to this day.
I get it,but if they signed a contract to appear,what are they supposed to do,Larry would be there but he decided he can't do it,so on with the show,it will sound fine,make lemonade people!
Now do a rant on the AWFUL versions of their own songs that they recorded in conjunction with Bono's book "Surrender".  They're lifeless and dull.
It is not like they have to do it because they need the money. This must be a contract written long before they knew Larry could not do it... it must be.
Well did the Rolling Stones continue after Charlie  Watts died ?  Money talks ,baby...
Lol... Tell us how you really feel Rick. 🤣
I love your videos and all the musical knowledge you share. by the way, I already asked you to comment on more U2 songs. I've been a fan of the band for as long as I can remember. I'm 45 years old I have to remember that U2 already played without Adam Clayton and although that was echoed in the media, it didn't provoke this backlash. This residency at Sphere had already been talked about for a few months. A unique opportunity to be the first to play in a space that matches everything U2 has tried in their live shows. immersiveness, spectacularity, breaking all barriers away from the audience. however, after all the appointments are taken and the gigantic marketing and touring machine is in motion, Larry has to undergo surgery. We don't even know what and how serious. should U2 stop everything? I don't think so. Would it be better with Larry? Of course. Will all tickets sell out in minutes? I bet!!!! I don't think I've ever seen a band stir up so much controversy. so much love, admiration, hate and contempt and that's amazing. It shows the greatness and unique influence that many seek to deny or lessen. I wish I could be at this concert and scream for Larry by the way. get well soon Larry, looks like you have a lot of fans. U2 forever
The stand in drummer for november gigs, will be from The Netherlands..
And if Larry is unable to continue they should follow Zeps lead.
U2 is a cooking rhythm section, a singer and a guitarist plays variations on the same rif. Chuck-- chuka- chuck-chuka. You could replace the latter two but not the former. I'm a 63 year old rocker never U2 big fan. Imo
U2 is a business that must keep making money. Happened to The Rolling Stones too.
I agree.  Wait until your band mate is well enough to play. U2 fans want to see Larry, not a replacement drummer.
Graveyards are full of people who couldn't be replaced. C'est la vie.
Agree with you Rick. This also shows that besides all of us music geeks, musicians etc. that care about this stuff, the general everyday passive listener won't care or even know the difference. Hell, half of them only think U2 is Bono and that's it. I think we're giving the normal guy who listens to a band, knows a few hits, too much credit!
Wasn't sure how to get this question to you, but have you done anything on the Producers? Since you're in Atlanta ... Love your channel.
Bono’s stocks and investments crashed so he needs the money!
Would we like him behind the drums ? Of course ! I think it's fair that they want to play, even without him. They aren't getting younger ! It's up to the fans to decide if they wish to pay or not for that concert.
This is why I stopped listening to them after Joshua Tree. Saw them in '87, and it's been a steady sellout ever since. Vegas hasn't only killed Elvis, it's finally, and justifiably killing U2 now.
Just another case where the drummer is perceived as being "replaceable, just put anybody in there, it doesn't matter".  This is NOT true and especially for a long time legacy band, foolish to think.  I'm sure U2 has a lot of clout and could have postponed the gig and wait for Larry to return.
Always felt Bono was an egomaniac. And I’m a U2 fan (altho I’ve waned in last ten years or so admittedly).
You know it's Over when 'Whoredom' strikes.
It is what it is. They all do. Pantera, Kiss, David Lee Roth, Cure,.... They need to maintain their lifestyles
As always, it's all about the Benjamin's! $$$$$$
Where the beats have no name.
It's only for a while. Shows where booked. Larry couldn't make it. U2 adjusted by overly advertising in an unpopular way to true fans. Weird? Yes. Not the real thing? I get that. But Larry will come back. Stated as well by the band. The other drummer is a solution to a problem. Plus. I've seen him play on numerous occasions. This guy is good. No joke. But I get how people who've loved U2 for many years receive this as awkward. Thing is, bands get older, so do their members. And so do we. Sometimes it's hard to accept realities such as that. U2 did it. Maybe people should be more empathic to Larry's situation instead of rambling on about how they feel themselves....
Metal Band... widely known (outside US) as one of the greatest of all time. Consistently put out great albums since 1995. Just toured America with lead singer 60 years old, promoting a brand new album that is the best metal album of the year (or decade?). Band has never had a lineup change.   Rick Beato says... "Let's pay more attention to U2!"  Come on, man.
WTF dude, I don't like U2 but if they enjoy playing then why shouldn't they. Even if one of them isn't well enough to.  Do you rant about the Stones still playing or Rod Stewart?
I was told by a long time horn player, now in his 80's, that as drummers age they tend to loose their chops before players of other instruments. I'm curious how you feel about the Stones continuing on without Charlie? I find that when singers age it can be a pretty sharp decline. There's the money ...hard to turn down and there are artist who get up in the morning and that's what they do.
I would have a hard time believing it’s because they need money. I’ve been a fan since 1980. I’ve lost some love throughout the years but I still get in a mood that only putting on The Unforgettable Fire will do. Getting rid of Larry Mullen, Jr? No way!!
Ha! Spot on assessment! I've been reading Bono's book, Surrender, which has revitalized my love for U2 but this Vegas move (without Larry Mullen, Jr.) is an oddity. That said, this may be the reality: What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...
This kinda reminds me of TV shows that keep going and going and going just because they're popular. (The Walking Dead, I'm looking at you...) It's so much better for things to have a story arc...a beginning, middle and end. These guys probably just need a paycheck so they're going to do this no matter what it takes.
It's just some shows. It's only some shows that they are clearly being paid for. When Adam can't show up for the biggest television appearance they have been or ever made from being too drunk. Nobody said a word about them replacing him that day. It's just some shows without a drummer who clearly can't drum for it. I didn't bitch when Neil Peart said I can't do this. I'm not going to now
There are some really great 'tribute' bands out there doing U2 - The 'fill-in' drummer will be playing (let's hope) carbon copy Larry Mullen Jnr, his beats. I'd certainly think they should call it a day if Larry wasn't able to at least artistically direct the band and the output - For Achtung Baby he did that job decades ago. A new U2 album without him involved would definitely not be U2.
There were times in the past when Adam Clayton was unable to tour due to health reasons. It happens and the living got to go on living.
I've followed you on many musical adventures Rick but you're on your own on this one. Sounds like you're asking them to pack it in. Pffft. While the band is in residency in LA Larry can get the medical issues looked and heal. The band can play because they've been gone a long time. And your ideas is to just get them to quit? What is with your griping? Sorry buddy but you'll have to dry your tears on this one.
The only time the full band didn't play a show was on November 26th 1993 in Sydney when Adam was having alcohol issues. He showed up too drunk to perform and had to be replaced last minute by his technician and it shook him up so much to not be up there with the band that he quit alcohol right there and then. It sure doesn't feel like U2 without all four members. I'm assuming Mullen is ok with it though. Anyway if it turns out Mullen can't play anymore (Im confident about his surgery though, they do marvels nowadays) I definitely think the band should retire from performing. Though i don't know that Bono would know how to live without playing shows.
They should go out and play along to the drum parts from the record, then cash that check.
it becomes all clear when you view it from a business perspective. The best selling living band in the world selling their best product live knowing it will sell to willing-paying consumers...
I worked with the band a few times in the late 90's - early 2000's. It would be interesting to know who is covering for LMJ. Sam O'Sullivan has been LMJ's drum tech and fill in percussionist since very early in the band's history. It's been a long time so I don't know if he's still around, but back then he was the shadowy figure playing the kit when LMJ came out front with his floor tom, etc. Sam is one of the sweetest people I've ever met professionally and I wouldn't feel bad seeing him play. Not even sure if that is a possibility.
let's face it, las Vegas residencies are money making bullshit with the art  utterly forgotten. If they did it without any original members I wouldn't be surprised
Additionally, I've seen Fleetwood Mac play without Christine McVie. I've seen Sting play Police songs with his own backing band. I've seen Paul McCartney play Beatles songs with his own backing band. The Eagles toured without Glenn Frey. Saw the Rolling Stones play when they were basically just Mick and Keith. Why would "new fans" snub their noses at hearing great artists play great songs unless they could hear the original lineup. That is a weird position to stake.
I'm sure that there are issues that we are not aware of behind the scenes.  I would think that the residency was in the works prior to Larry needing the surgery.  It would be costly to cancel now.  They are a popular band and would need a large venue.  They are not going to just work in a generic space or one that was customized for someone else.  Maybe there is a huge penalty for backing out now.  Perhaps they don't want to lose the opportunity.  I am sure that it is explained somewhere on the internet.
I'd prefer an angle grinder next to my ear to u2.
Well, I guess the WEF thing has bitten the dust for Bono, so whaddaya gonna do?!
I for one have no desire to see them with a replacement. U2 is not U2 without Larry.
Maybe a time to call it quits as Rick says.
ACCCHHHTUNG!!  behbee?
Rest assured, we’ll see Larry Mullen Jr in two years when U2’s “Search for More Money Tour” kicks off.
It is no shock that one of the band members wouldn't be available.  If it were Bono or The Edge missing from the roster it wouldn't work.  Yes, it would be nice to have all of the original band members.  But it does work without their drummer.  Lastly, Rick knows more than anyone, unless you want to rely on backing tracks or a second drummer, it's hardest for the drummer more than any other band member to maintain a rigorous schedule.  Especially when they are nearly 50 years on into their career.
Larry isn’t playing. They have their reasons. All those cool drum bits have been written and recorded. Which means many other capable drummer will be able to pick up sticks and lay it down. You do what you can.
Rick, what's worse is this re-imagined 40 songs or whatever that they are releasing called Songs of Surrender. I've heard a few of them. They're nothing to write home about. They're not good. I would rather listen to the original versions of these songs. I've been a fan since I was 12 in 1984. I think they are really "jumping the shark" here. Good golly!!
I discovered U2 as a teenager with Achtung Baby back in 1992. The love affair grew and grew - i was as hardcore as they came. It was around 2005 when i started to scratch my head a little. the songs just weren't all that good anymore, and started feeling a little contrived. The blackberry product placements, the *extremely* selective standing up for justice, the eagerness to be seen as one of the big boys be it Apple, Davos, or politicians of all shapes (but only one size). It just didn't feel like rock n roll anymore, it felt like an unending popularity contest. i've been done with them for a while now. Achtung Baby is unimpeachable, but the band... i just see them as overly needy, and not just for money.
I get it. It's weird. But what makes a band a band? The current Pantera lineup is not Pantera...but they're touring as if they are. And they're good, but it's just not the same without Dime and Vinnie. Same here... Will proba ly sound good, but it's not the same with Larry. Also... Why Achtung Baby? It's weird all around. Very specifically weird.
Good morning Rick , first of all you are the best ... keep it up..... I must have stepped away as I missed the U2 commercial during Super Bowl , so this YouTube news is the first I am hearing about this , good to hear it from a friend. This seems to be the stupidest thing I have heard about in a long time, and I think the real fans would wait a little longer to have the real band show up for this. It just seems to be a money grab which I think flies in the face of what this band has been about their whole career , and now Bono himself should shut his big mouth about whatever cause he is flying up the flagpole next , as he is just another sellout now , with way less credibility than before.  Would I go see this, maybe,  but I would not consider it a U2 show , just another Vegas freak/sideshow.
Couldn't agree more Rick. I never thought a band like U2 that has always stood for so much and rebelled against the norm could sell out so badly.  Playing Vegas is bad enough but without Larry!! ?? 🤷🏻‍♂️ And let's not even start with the "Reimagining" of old classics to look forward to 🙄
Nostalgia reigns supreme in the older rock community. The only way live music should be heard is by a traditional concert tour with all of the pain associated, no matter what age the band is? Just don't connect with that. Of course I'm getting old and what I consider an effort now would have been laughable in 20s-30s. Even 40s. When we comment on a business strategy, the proof is in the results. I don't believe we have those do we? On missing a founding member... This may not be analogous but its where my old brain went. My first concert was Jackson Browne 1974. Seeing him now play his old songs without David Lindley is a brain scramble. He was a part of the DNA of everything Jackson did back then. But I still enjoy it. This is old people talk....  On the plus side, love your channel Rick. Its fun.
You are very passionate about this band
I visited the Joshua Tree in 2012 and felt closer to God at that tree than I did in any church and I got this feeling God is up there right now saying wtf?
Robert Smith would be chuckling, I mean to say....how many drummers have The Cure had? Do you see them for Lol ? or Boris? Sadly, can't see Andy Anderson rip, any more ...Jason Cooper? yet, they each had to play songs the others originally recorded and it works all the time!
Money talks bullshit walks
This. Absolutely.
Larry's having surgery and is needing a long recovery period. Larry himself wants  them to continue regardless. So what do you do? Ignore Larry??
They must of had a fat Elvis wallet to pay for an ad on the super bowl circuit,those ads are expensive,$uperBowl Sunday bloody Sunday. 🤣👍🇺🇸
Aerosmith did the same thing when they hit Vegas… no Joey Kramer.
I'm not a fan of U2, but if any of the bands I love played live with a replacement member instead of delaying until the health of the person improved, I'd be turned off of it completely. Even in cases where the "MVP" band members have died (Metallica, Slipknot) I just can't enjoy the live performances nearly as much, and that's a situation where they have no choice. But if your member is sick, just don't play. You would never replace a front man, don't treat the instrumentalists that way either, because they bring just as much to the table in terms of performance and vibe.
Shout out to Def Leppard for sticking with their drummer!
How about the Edge always wearing a stupid beanie even though we know he's bald.  He wears it to formal events.  Or how about Edge being turned down by California when he proposed building on environmentally protected land.  I still love their music, most of these missteps aren't criminal, they're just a little cringeworthy.
Josh Freese?
Knowing the facts as we do today (2.15.23), this makes absolutely no sense at all and frankly is f'ing disappointing as hell. My biggest fear is that Larry's health is worse then they are telling us. And if it is, the band should respect this and walk away from the money that they absolutely do not need. They have been my favorite band since 1981 and I certainly don't "need" to see just 3 of their faces on stage - and they really don't need to see mine.
Some of the best notes are the ones left un-played.
U2 minus 1: ridiculous! I'm sure you get a multitude of requests but would maybe do a "what makes this song great" of the song Wire off Unforgettable Fire?
I went to see U2 on the Joshua Tree revisited tour 2018.  One of the greatest disappointments in a long time.  You could just tell they were trying to just pay bills.  I've been s fan of U2 literally my entire life and I wont go to see them again.
Which came first - the contracts being signed for the Sphere gig, or Larry finding out he needs surgery?
I wonder how much of the $7 million spent on the ad will they get back?
As a lifelong fan of U2 I was surprised by this announcement regarding Larry Mullen Jr. I hope he recovers fully and is able to rejoin the band eventually. Obviously there is no bad blood between the members as they recently appeared together at the Kennedy Center Honors. This is likely more contractual than anything else. No matter how they have decided to sell these performances ( A celebration of Achtung, Baby. A return to the stage for the fans) they can not back out now. Too much money on the table and law suits would ensue if they cancelled. It is unfortunate. The folks that will go to Vegas and pay the astronomical prices for tickets are not their typical fan. When the band finishes up the residency they will hit the road on a proper tour with Larry Mullen Jr.
I had a summer job at an incredible  record store when when I heard Boy. Holy S**t. Instant fan girl. I grew with monumental music from the ‘60s & ‘70s because of my 9 & 12 year old brothers. One brother gave me Tommy at 12. Who does that?! So I had the ear to recognize greatness & Boy blew me away. The brother who gave me Tommy asked me once what new bands of the era had the staying power to become greats. Without even thinking out popped U-2. I forget the other two. Perhaps The Police & The Talking Heads. So yeah. What are they thinking?!?! And when did U-2 need a residency? Just call it quits already.
1.The replacement drummer could be amazing, with Larry's full blessing. 2. Maybe Larry hates Vegas, on top of his surgery 3. Different musicians have different muscles to exercise. Bono's voice probably needs to grind out shows from time to time or it all will just go away. Now I may not go and see them in Vegas - I didn't love Achtung, Baby - but I'm not sure there is anything to be outraged by here, and I'm a total music snob. 🤔
Definitely top 3 overrated bands of all time.see also oasis and rem
Wait until you hear about The Who.
Ringo, when going through health problems, was temporarily replaced by Jimmie Nichol during part of The Beatles' 1964 world tour. Nobody rejected the Rolling Stones when Mick Taylor replaced Brian Jones after he was fired. Nobody rejected the Stones when Ron Wood replaced Mick Taylor. They continued as the Stones after Bill Wyman left ; and now Charlie Watts is no longer with us. Elwood Francis has replaced the late Dusty Hill in ZZ Top who will be releasing new music under that name.  Wishing Larry Mullen a speedy recovery, but as the old adage goes "The show must go on".
Spot on!
Oh, to know, the band, and so, to quote 3rd track of romum !c  e   He ppooppooqqeeeooeeppoo2
U2🤟🏽🤘🏽
Having grown up with U2, the idea of them playing without Mullen is absurd.  It reminds me of the Mustang SUV which denies the Mustangliness thereof,  Yuck yuck yuck!
He spoke to his Buddy Rich
A group (or artist) knowing when to leave the stage at their peak is an elusive skill.  Crossing the line between relevancy to being a musical curiosity is a thin one.
Rick, Veteran’s Stadium 1992!! i was there too. great show.
We are very proud they choose a guy from The Netherlands. He is the drummer from the band Krezip. Bye the way U2 got his financial headquarters in the Netherlands 😂
Dear U2: What Rick said! We love you guys all so much!!! You inspire us and fill us with joy. You make us think and you make us better. **Please don’t debase what you are that your new manager gets his payday.** We will be here for the band always, but none of us ever were rocked by your manager. With our most sincere love, JOM
Jeez, calm down everyone! Bands replace performing musicians all the time, on either a full-time or temporary basis, especially the "legacy" bands that reunite and tour on an almost annual basis. Now I am NOT a U-2 fan but that is besides the point. If Bono and the boyz want to use other musicians for a tour or residency, than more power to them. Better to keep playing and performing rather than stagnating, and certainly better than waiting for an indefinite time period for the recovery of a band member with obvious health problems that may require a long rehabilitation and continuing treatment. Consider too, that playing drums and percussion can be a difficult task for older musicians (Rick knows that, I think!) particularly for those with a health issue or physical infirmity. So Rick's stance seem quite curious to me.
Not U2 without Larry.
YEP. BIG MISTAKE.
I'm with you Rick.
Look man the album is probably mostly programmed drums so Larry said F it I’m not playing over electronic drums or recreating computer drums. I’m sure he said fine bye.
he is only the drummer...... who cares...lol drummers are interchangeable..lets not pretend otherwise please.Yes he came up with the parts..they arent virtuoso, they can be copied easily and by drummers who are probably better
YES! You you are correct. But you didn't mention the new "reimagined" songs One, With or Without You and Pride from the upcoming Songs of Surrender release.........I can't be the only one that is not a fan.
yeah. bad move. U2 has been my favorite band since the War album.
This is why I have great admiration and respect for Led Zeppelin. Without Bonzo, there IS NO Led Zep. Sure the three guys could have made boatloads of money, and maybe even justify it and make it palatable by saying "hey...at least Bonzo's son is on the drums" but nope....that's still not Led Zep.
Hard to disagree with you, Rick. I’m 43, and my first exposure was Zooropa in 1994. Loved everything before it, too, including Rattle and Hum.
Biggest talentless hacks I've ever seen.  Kesha is a close 2nd
Rick I’m always looking at you wall o amps. Do you not have any mesas?
Dusty Hill was in ZZ Top from 1969 to 2021 and when he died, ZZ Top were back on the road within days. Sad. Pathetic. Artists/bands are corporations. A death or absence is just a "staffing issue" and can not be allowed to interfere with the company's never ending cash grab.
I'm sure that in retrospect we will all agree that it turned out fine with Bram van den Berg.
Not a single word about Larry's health issue!?!?  You missed an important point Rick.
George Harrison was  right. They really are pretentious fops. . I always felt they were superb posers. However I really appreciated some of the music and The Edge (TM)  ...how do you call yourself The Edge and be more than 18? Who can argue with this one trick pony that took over modern guitar play.? But to install yourself in Las Vegas with with Celine and Donny and Marie is such a staggering statement on who and what you are.  A beautiful  and fitting coda.  I expect a U2 themed Casino is on the table drawing board.
Kalispera Maestro. I hope you are doing well. Will you consider analysing 'Blue Skies' by Irving Berlin, but the Willie Nelson version? Berlin's piano playing was limited and apparently he picked out many a melody with just the black notes of the piano which, as you know is the pentatonic. Also, Nelson's version has an awesome semitone shift. Love from Greece. T & Z xxx
Watch the southpark about Bono and you will understand lol
It would be different if this was a fully booked tour.  But Vegas?   Dumping this news in an ad during the Super Bowl was kind of cheesy.  Canceling a Vegas residency is done all the time, most recently Adele pulling the plug at the last minute, and in U2's case we're talking the fall of 2023.  I say Larry Mullen Jr has quit.  U2 needs to come clean about this.
Two of my favorite bands have changed their line up multiple times. Faith No More and Alice in Chains. They still made records I loved, and in some cases like in the case of Faith No More they even got better after the changes. Though I do understand, some members are irreplaceable and when they are gone, it's not the same thing. But such is life. If it's due to health issues, or in case of AIC Layne passing away, I can't really blame them too much for it.
Right on the money, Rick.  No Larry = No U2.
I'm wondering if this isn't due to some contractual obligations they already had in place, and Larry's surgery came up afterward.  They have made some odd choices the last 10 years, particularly with the Songs of Surrender album.
It’s not ideal but I’m still excited about this. Best album, best era, will Bono dress like the Fly again ? So much to look forward to. Larry will heal and then they can get onto new things together.
Oh for the love of God, let the band make their own decisions. Rick has no idea how good the stand-in drummer is, so this is all supposition on his part. If LMJ is recovering from health problems, then let him heal. Drummers have a highly physical job and I hate to say this, but they are often the first members to be replaced with a younger player.
Think about how Pantera fans feel lol
0:52 I thought Buddy Rich passed sometime in the 80s?
Absolutely agree. When I heard Larry wasn't going to be performing, my interest in attending plummeted.
Folks will pay $1000+ for a ticket with or without Larry. Not me, but there are plenty who will, and U2 appreciates it all the way to the bank.
it’s just awkward when you’re using the U2 image, (a band of 4 “brothers”)to sell the gig, and in the very same breath say, “Oh, btw, there’s only 3 of us showing up. “Clumsy” advertising to be sure.
I wish Larry is great and well he is the best I”ve been fan of u2 since I was a teenager for more than 25 years I hope to see you again all 4 together and healthy!
I bought the Ultimate Bundle last year, without the Beginner Guitar Course, I wrote to them, and Beato CS is really good and accommodating. You can still add it with a small fee. Thank you very much.
I think the band should have retired at least an album or two ago. I'm a huge fan too, and I remember when the album came out into our iTunes accounts. According to Bono in his new memoir, it was his idea and he takes full responsibility for it.   The Police did it right stopping when they were on top. Now, after the 80's U2 still had a lot of gas in the tank and some really wonderful ideas. These last two albums were not great though, especially the last one. Songs of Innocence has grown on me a bit but I almost never listen to Songs of Experience.
i like Dark Beato. calling it as everyone sees it. agree 100%.
Let's face it, we live in a world of lies and illusions. The truth will come out eventually.   On that note, look at what's going on within Journey. Neal, as great a musician as he, needs a cargo ship size of humbling. His ego will be the downfall of Journey. Just my own personal opinion.... and we all know what they say about opinions. 😉
In 1964, the Beatles toured in Australia with a drummer called Jimmie Nicol, since Ringo was sick.
A lot of people don't know the true genius, talents, and how good some bands were till now. Try remember them at their peaks is the best thing you can do. Watching them doing a show is not the same.
Like Larry Mullen Jr isn't getting paid a ton of money from this also lol
I stopped my self as a fan after unforgettable fire, I love October, War, etc, then sometimes they come out with gems like Beautiful day, here and there.  I have a great respect and love for them, maybe they have to riconsider music from another point of view.  They are the most influential band in rock pop music since decades (coldplay)  Come on...
Apart from this all clearly being about making money, . . . who says the stand-in is not a good drummer, just because he's not world famous (yet)
Hearing after the fact about Neil Peart's health issues I feel bad that he went through all that pain to do the last tour. At least at a residency one could set up therapy and a comfortable living space. The odd thing about neil is he likes being on the road it lets him do his motorcycling
They suffer in Madonna-syndrome
I really don't think it's ridiculous if Larry can't play. Even the Beatles did a tour with a stand-in drummer. My beloved Sea Power played a few dates with a stand-in drummer instead of the excellent Woody. Maybe not ideal but better than nothing.
Just temporarily, and it's NOT the first time they've done this. At least the third time. First Mullen had back surgery, second he had hurt his foot. Jeese, it's not like the end of the world.
The gig aside - the way Rick pronounces “Achtung“ is hilarious
So I pretty well agree right down the line with you Rick and I had no idea Larry wouldn’t be with him… I heard about the residency I have mixed feelings on that… Just don’t know how special it will be but it will certainly make them accessible to a lot more people but without Larry…Bag it. I had one shot really good shot to go see you to back around 2012 in Charlottesville Virginia at UVA stadium… Got sick and couldn’t go front of my one in my place he said it was the most phenomenal concert he’s ever seen it might’ve been 2010 I can’t remember but regardless all the regional guys… So I’ve never seen them live it’s been a bucket list thing to see them live like it was to see the eagles I waited too long Glenn Frey no longer with us even though I’d still like to see the Eagles and it’s not a special seeing Vince Gill up there even as cool as he is there’s a part of me that doesn’t want to do it… And if I was going to go and there’s no Larry Mullen there’s a part of me that says nope… I’m like you maybe it’s time to just hang it up or only tour when you have all the original dudes. I still like to hear some new albums from them I still think they have a lot in them, and for dudes that are getting up there in years they can still rock but I am not interested in seeing you to live without Larry or any of them it’s a package or not at all
I don't think this is a big deal. Larry says it's OK. They want to open the Sphere. Larry will be back.
A rock band has a shelf life. I always said at the age of around 40 a rock musician needs to stop touring. It's hard to have teen angst when you're 40. They need to pivot into a new field such as producing. U2 is falling into the same category as the Stones and The Beach Boys. There comes a point where you're just a parody of your former self. An occasional live performance is cool but that's it. Hopefully you're smart and save some money when you're young. Big misstep by the band.
New Order isn't New Order without Peter Hook. The Stones aren't the Stones without Charlie Watts. U2 isn't U2 without Larry Mullen. So I think the band is unofficially dead.
I think they should do it. Just change the band name to "U 1.5"
I'd love to see Achtung Baby performed in full... But no I won't go to Las Vegas to see it, and no I wouldn't go unless Larry was drumming
U2 is one of a very few bands whose  integrity I respect  - same 4 members since inception. Very sad that Mr Mullins is dealing with health issues that prevent him from being able to play. Not knowing the whole story, I won't comment about the Vegas gig...but I will pray that Larry Mullins will recover and rejoin the band very soon- he is the heartbeat of U2!
Larry ain't being replaced..... everyone calm down
U2 landing in your iTunes playlist as an album...is NOT spyware, intrusive...nooooo..cannot be..the album isn't a person. You got free music... nothing is better than that. All its says ...is the people whinging about that are neurotic, illogical and need a good talking to
Thank you Rick. Great rant. I became a great fan of U2 in 1983 watching the gig at Loreley St. Gioarshausen/Germany on TV From War to Pop they surfed the big wave. In my opinion the 1991 album Achtung Baby was the climax of their successful career. And the Zoo TV shows was State of the Art.. Mind-blowing.  From 2000 on with "All That You Can't Leave Behind" I slowly lost interest in U2. They became boring to me. The last show I've attented was in 2005 at Olympic stadium in Munich. They always wanted to stay relevant but they lost the plot and the relevance. Obviously the want to go for a big hit for the last 20 years. The last one was Beautiful Day. Instead of creating quality and sometimes more experimental music they create cheesy boring stuff throughout the years. Totally uncool For me they are HasBeens. Sorry
Residency’s are only good for the band…I call it: THE TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN TOUR!!! As the old popular saying goes: SELL OUT and in a bad way! I saw U2 on the Joshua Tree tour in 87 for $18.50 and was 8th row center stage! A decade later on the POPMART tour in 97 I saw them in Oakland stadium for $50 dollars and I left before the show ended because it truly sucked! Plus I’m a drummer so no Larry Mullen Jr equals no go for me regardless of the cost! I just can’t believe the band would perform without him and he founded U2 and U2 wouldn’t exist without him. Enough soapbox preaching but in my estimation it’s called: U2 SELLOUT AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY IN MY BOOK! JUST SAYIN!
They should take a page from rush. In an interview, Getty Lee said that if a member decides to leave the band, they would stop playing because rush was and is about the three founding members. To this day, they have not played since they lost their Drummer.
U2 has officially entered their "Fat Elvis Period."
The man needs to rest and recover. Show must go on.
They need Adam Lambert to front it !!
So does Larry Mullen Jr. get paid? This band U2 is broke. Record companies have made their money off of them. The older bands need to sustain their business the residency option probably pays off. So Larry will get paid, right?
I am totally with you at this!
Was a huge U2 fan for decades. Have just about all the albums.  I find Bono and to some degree the Edge annoying enough to change the station when one of their songs come on.
Now try being a Sleater-Kinney fan after what they did to Janet Weiss
"Some fill in guy" 😂😂😂 Rick's pissed and i get it.
One of the reasons for the substitution is apparently to 'obey their contract'. Okay. But who in the world would sign a contract with U2 that would allow them to replace any band member instead of the actual band members? Do they get a discount on the band's fee if any member gets replaced? If so, how much would the discount be if they replaced say 2 or 3 members? Does any U2 member need to be present to obey the contract? I have questions.
When you do a LV residency you have essentially admitted you are done and just doing a money grab.  Not a fan, one of the most over rated groups in history.  I did see them once and have to admit they were great live.  Just not a big fan of their music.
If they had pride they would call the thing off. That would be the sweetest thing
I was at ZOO TV in dublin about 1992 it was the best concert i ever been too.
I've been a total U2 Fan since The album October and I saw them live so many times, each time they played in France actually, until the Zoo TV Tour. My favourite albums are The Unforgettable Fire and Achtung Baby. But I almost never listend to their more recent stuff (with the exception of Magnificent which was a gorgeous song) and I would not want to go to a concert without Larry Mullen at the drums. Larry is the founding memeber and his drumming is the core of U2's music. Most of all, a Vegas residency sounds like the negation of the rock spirit. To me, U2  playing Vegas sounds like a great Chef organizing a fine parmigiano reggiano tasting on the production line of a velveeta factory...
Money drives the business of music. Always has. Always will. I agree. Why do a live gig without your main guy on tubs. I don't get it. Wait till he's ready to play... Then book the gig.
I had the same reaction, Rick! Can’t imagine them performing without Larry, let alone performing a monumental record like Achtung Baby. Doesn’t make sense
Well said Rick!
For this gig, they could call themselves U2.0
I will never forget the first time I listened to Unforgettable Fire w my little sister.  We were sitting on the floor with our ears next to the speakers of our parents giant furniture stereo. The opening drum sequence to a sort of homecoming still gives me chills.
Oh rick, I'm anthony from france, I love your comment on U2 ! i love them, but what. this is time ! time to stay home !
My guess is that Larry is very sick and he will probably be out for a long period, otherwise this makes no sense - I wish they were honest about the whole situation. At lease for their die hard fan !
Honestly, I think something weird is happening with U2 for some time now. A lot of appearances where only Bono and The Edge were present, videos, interviews. The only time I´ve seen the four of them together was at the Kennedy Center Honors. I thought the band had broken up. Now there are these sad news of health problems with Larry Mullen... and it immediately reminded me of Neil Peart. How "Rush" suddenly stopped doing shows and they said Peart had retired. I hope it´s nothing like that. BUT, if everything is all right with Mullen it´s a very stupid idea to have these shows without him. Come on, it´s U2, you can afford to wait until he is fit to tour again.
There's been such little actual explanation from the band - hence all the speculation.  Plus, why on earth are none of the band in the trailer? They're all lookalikes. But no explanation. Very weird.
I think most people are missing the point to this post. My issue isn’t a replacement drummer as much as the fact that they took out an ad during the Super Bowl to promote a gig that one of the four members is not going to play. This extended video ad shows all these new fans (and one old one) to U2 that are desperate to hear the Achtung Baby record. If it’s so important for these “new fans” to hear, U2 play this particular record, isn’t it important to include all the original band members? Is this something that could’ve been advertised on U2.com and not the biggest sporting event in the US? Bands replace members or have musicians fill in all the time but they don’t advertise these gigs on the Super Bowl. As a long time, U2 fan, I thought it was an odd move. Larry is the driving force behind the band. The were a stadium band because of him.
I was there in 2006 Aloha Stadium as well! Also uncomfortable about this no Larry Mullin Jr nonsense
If I was around Las Vegas I would be so pissed of, the Ashtung Baby tour is the one I would really want to attend. U2 fan since 1982 (?), anyway since War.
I'm a huge U2 fan since 1988 and I've got more than a hundred itens of the band between LPs, CDs, VHSs, DVDs, books, etc. They're a decadent band for the last 20 years and, in this period, haven't released one hour of really good music. Their last good record was the soundtrack for The Million Dollar Hotel (what an ensemble they've gathered). Even the side project Passengers was surprising and fresh at the time of the release (Brian Eno rules!), much more interesting than what they did after 2002/2003. BUT I don't care. They gave the world a lot already, between 1980 and 2000. They can do whatever they want, even dumb or inocuous things. If other people likes it, I'm fine with it.
So you can only be an AB fan if you are old enough to be alive when that record came out? Lame argument. Im a huge U2 fans from decades and although I agree with the LMJ absence your arguments are shallow.
I’m not a fan of U2 and I think I still have some songs in my iTunes account.  I delete them as they come up in rotation
U2 has essentially become their own tribute band. Their Joshua Tree Redux tour basically announced that they're out of ideas and just out to rake in some cash from folks who didn't get to see them in their heyday. Why Vegas? Because Elvis! Well also, because touring is horribly difficult and expensive; The Edge's gear alone takes up one of the what is it now, six semis?
I think this all depends on Larry and his input into the decision.
No different than Fleetwood Mac...an equally iconic band...touring without Lindsey Buckingham a few years ago.  Greed.  You can also look at how Rush and ZZ Top each handled the death of one member of their trios.  ZZ Top quickly "replaced" Dusty Hill and kept touring...Rush, I'm quite certain, will never perform again under the Rush name.
Isn't a band getting a "Las Vegas Residency" kinda like your grandparents getting a Florida timeshare? A sure indication that you are now old and ready to retire.
U2 did perform without Adam Clayton in the early 1990s when his bass tech filled in.
Dear Rick, let there be music, big hug
Is Tyrion sitting in with U2?
They’re money grabbers!
With or without, ..Larry Mullen JR.  Yes, Mullen jr did miss only a few shows in the past. But to me it's a stupid rant, because it's merely about none of U2's members really missed out early on, or that there were no member changes like in bands like the Stones or Metallica. Even Queen plays on with a new singer.   Achtung Baby is U2's greatest album in the eyes of many fans. So why not? Would U2 like to have seen it differently if possible, would fans have? Sure! But if people don't  mind because of circumstances and the band is commited to that 'tour', ..carry on.  Maybe this time you're more stuck in your mind than you think, Rick.  ..I don't even know why I bother writing, because not to long ago I heard you say on a live chat you don't even read the comments. Carry on 🙄👍🏻
$$$
Theres a lot of hate out there for Bono .  Why is that ? I haven't listened to them since  Mysterious ways
First, I don't think they made the decision without  Mullen's consent. Second, it's a bit of exaggeration to think no one else can play Mullen's drum parts. Third, I wonder how many fans will be able to tell the difference in a blind test. So, actually I think it's a storm in a cup of tea.
Hmm... smells like a cash-grab ploy to me. I was a fan of their first few records, not so much anything past that, except for moments here and there. I even think this would be an ill-advised move even *with* Larry Mullen, let alone without him. As you say, smells like greedy management to me. Cheers!
I was 9 when my father bought me my first drum kit, and Larry was the first drummer that fired up my imagination. Then came Ian Paice, Stewart Copeland...almost 20 years later, now I play jazz and experimental music; something that Larry probably wont like. But Larry was my gatekeeper to drumming and I still admire him a lot.  Thank you Larry and I wish you all the best for your recovery. Also a big thank you from Italy to Rick for all your videos, which are super!
They are one, but they’re not the same.
I don’t like the word “replace” for LMJ. More like this person will be a stand in  or placeholder. There is no replacement for any member of U2. I am happy to hear actually they are doing a residency in Vegas.
jethro tull, martin barre? idk the history..
Devil's advocate here, but I don't think this is as tragic as it's seems.  Larry's exclusion from this gig was choice made months ago, if not more, and the choice was his.  I find him to be a man of great integrity to allow himself to sit out while the band that has been his life continues.  True, U2's sound weighs heavily on LMJr's drumming, but so was Bill Wyman's influence on the Rolling Stones sound, ...I don't remember anyone lamenting, or "ranting" when Bill decided to call it a day, and the Stones are still doing quite well.   For all we know LMJr wants to let his body heal, perhaps he has other health problems we don't know about, or wants to spend his golden days with family, again...integrity.  That's all for now, thank you for all you do Rick Beato!!!
Actually, U2 original members have been together for 46 years. It was a kind of an immortal line-up... until now.
At what point did they sell their souls ? I'm not sure ...this latest is a rather oddball choice. Listened to Actung baby last year a few times after many years, thought I'd rediscover the love from early 90's but was underwhelmed over all.  Aside from Larry's drumming and love is blindness.
I have to say I agree with Rick - I think it's a ridiculous decision and one they might regret.  And for those saying "it's been in the works for ages, contracts signed etc" it's not like the members of U2 (or the parent company through which they work) can't either pay penalties for walking away or possibly say "look, we can't do it now, Larry isn't well. Organise shows with someone else for the dates agreed and when Larry is able / fit again, we'll do the shows then".  I didn't see a huge kerfuffle when Adele had to postpone her Vegas residency, and that was because the show wasn't ready, it wasn't a proper reason like the drummer of 43 years and founder of the band needs surgery and physically can't play !!
"He explained that he has injured his ‘elbows, knees [and] neck,’ and requires surgery, and that if the band go on tour next year, it won’t be with him." I love Rick but I don't see the problem. He is physically unable to perform. The band hasn't played live in three years and is dying to get in front of people again. He's given his blessing for the band to perform w/o him. With any luck it's only temporary and Godspeed to Larry's recovery from his ailments.
I've been a U2 fan since the very beginning, and the first U2 show I ever went to was at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, 1987.....but I can't agree with you more Rick.  This is just a bad idea.  I'm not ready to say they need to call it a day because I think they all have much more to give, but THIS is just a bad bad idea.  Let LMJ heal and THEN go out with him.  I don't care if he gave his blessing, this just doesn't work and for how innovative a band they were when Achtung Baby came out, they haven't been good with some decisions and this just adds to them.  Something would be missing...it wouldn't feel right.
The most disappointing thing about this whole mess is hearing that Rick is a U2 fan.
Fan since 2004, totally agree. (I've never see them live...)
Bono save us!!!
wait; so it's okay for the stones to do it, but not U2?  where's the charlie watts is dead rant?
Bono v Beato!
I don't see the problem.
Drummers are the most underpreciated members of the bands. They are game-changers. U2, smashing pumpkins, Nirvana, (early) pearl jam, arctic monkeys, Zep, Rush, you name it.
I was a huge U2 fan in the 80s.  I loved everything up until Rattle and Hum. When that came out, I still liked it though.  It just didn't have the same power as any of their previous albums, at least for me.  Overall, it seemed to be a flop though as friends wouldn't even mention the album or its songs.  After that album, I never bought another U2 album and had no interest in them.  They just bugged me, didn't have the same meaning to me anymore, and there was just way too much good music happening at that time to give them any chance.  I've liked some of their hits since Rattle and Hum, and I've tried to listen to an album, but just can't.  It's just too boring.  It's not the band I liked when I was younger.  It's odd that they probably got even bigger after the 80s than they ever were.
Have they sold their publishing rights? Could that factor into this?
That new upcoming album of reworked songs is what really scares me. So far every "reworked" version I've heard from it sounds just unbelievably awful.
I love U2 but it’s about the money. That’s it.
Agree completely. I feel like you read my comments left on the u2 channel😂 absolutely ridiculous…. As is this Songs of Surrender rehash of old sons. U2 have become a parody of themselves. Very disappointing
Big deal. Any man would do the same thing. All bands do the same thing.  They love the adulation. They love the adrenaline rush. They love all the MILFs throwing their 🐈 at them.
Bono is strapped for cash I’m sure…
It's not the first time U2 did a major project without one of its members. As others here have already mentioned, there was an Australian gig that Adam Clayton missed on the ZooTV Tour in '93 because of too much partying. It was a fairly critical show, too, a technical dry-run for a second show that would be broadcast live globally via satellite and would later be released on various home video formats. A roadie covered for Adam that night, wearing a baseball cap to hide the fact that he was a last-minute substitute. As I understand it, the incident caused Adam to seriously reevaluate his priorities and clean up his act.   Also, I believe Larry's back issues flared up rather infamously during the recording of the Pop album in '96, and the band continued without him for a time using drum loops and such. If I'm remembering correctly, the injury was one of the reasons why U2 always felt the album's production was rushed and unfocused, and that not enough time was spent rehearsing for the pre-booked PopMart Tour kicking off in the following Spring.
Larry said in an interview last year that due to health issues he wouldn't be touring with the band this year.  He even said in the same interview that the band had things in the works.  The guys aren't getting any younger and who knows if they were to wait around for Larry's physical condition to improve if they would ever play again.  I think this is an enormous overreaction.  It's not an ideal situation, but there are extenuating circumstances at play.
Have a cigar and relax. I can't see why this is a problem if Larry needs surgery, why is a fill in wrong. The Beatles did it back in the day.   I guess the contract was done and dusted. If anything it's a shedload of money as well.
As a fellow Dutchman: It is a cashgrab. Larry also will get millions. And let 'our' Bram have his moment with the band for some fixed fee. Everybody happy. U2 as we knew it is long gone.
Ouch. $$$$
At least he didn’t choke on his own vomit.  Big deal. Bands inevitably wind up with lineup changes. That’s life.
Larry knows himself whether he can do now what he once did. Drummers, of all musicians, are not always able to physically achieve their former prowess. They tend to over-medicate themselves (to put it politely) in order to force their body to do what it once was capable of without chemicals. I think Larry is wise. He has given his blessing and is probably delighted to be at home with his feet up.
I get it. LMjr and AC are probably the reasons I'd go see U2 at this point. However, the "replacing key members" precedent has been set by many bands already - The Who, Cheap Trick ... with the latest being The Rolling Stones (again) and ZZ Top. Maybe the ballsiest (not recent) was Queen.
This wouldn't have been a good idea two or three decades ago.  But audiences now are MUCH less demanding of specifics like this.  99 percent of the people buying tickets to this show probably couldn't name the drummer if you asked them... Or the bass player for that matter.  Audiences today are the lowest standard, unfortunately... And that's why the music business is in the horrific state that it has been in for the last twenty years.  Quite honestly, the modern audiences killed the art.
Rattle & Hum is absolutely amazing! One of my favorite concert films
Just curious if you feel the same way about Mötley Crüe touring without Mick Mars.
You Too Should Pay Taxes...                                .
On another perspective; for Bram van der Berg this is a HUGE opportunity. As a Dutchman myself, I feel proud he is the guy who has been chosen. But as well for musicians; these things can happen apparently. Your dreams can come true. Ha, so cool for him. Not fun for the fans of U2 who like to see the original band, but change happens sometimes.
It doesn't matter what you, me, or anyone else thinks. What matters is whether Larry Mullen Jr agreed with it and gave it his full blessing - that it was a unanimous decision. C'mon Rick, everything else is just clickbait, and you know it. Fans will vote with their pockets. No-one is being made to go and see these shows so if they do pay to do so, then it's all consensual, for all parties, no?
Larry Mullen Jr.’s artistry behind the kit has contributed as much to the bands success as did the Edge’s unique guitar sound. It’s almost impossible to imagine U2 with out him (aside from him being the one who started the group). He’s up there with Keith Moon and the Who and John Bonham and Led Zeppelin in terms of the vital input the drummer brought to the bands success.
Rick, a voice of reason and sanity in insane times! 😎🤟
And you thought it was about the music…
new MSG Las Vegas is owned by Oak View Group and build for residencies = Irving Azoff - new management is Full Stop = Jeff Azoff.  All Azoff clients will do residencies there.
Dude, there's a Pantera sans the Abbott Brothers touring around; talk about missing core founding members!
I don't get it. Dude's getting surgery so they're doing a few shows without him. I love the guy and would be disappointed to not see him, but this reaction doesn't make sense to me.
No, no. Seems like some of these major label older bands think that they can temporarily ( in this case?), or permanently replace drummers and no one's going to care, that drums are drums and drummers don't have their own individual "voices". I've always disagreed with this. Does U2 need money? Maybe the band members don't, maybe the U2 corporation does. I'm guessing one of those Vegas residencies grosses a lot of dollars. Everyone knows the advertising spots during the Superbowl cost a lot. Why can't they wait a year, or 2, or 3, however long it takes until Larry is healed? I don't like this kind of thing at all.  Could be that there is more to it like others here have said. Perhaps Larry isn't sure if he can/ or wants to come back so because he isn't sure and the other guys are tired of waiting for a decision they're doing it like this for now. But if it's really, he's having surgery and definitely coming back afterwards then wait for the guy! Jeez. I wonder if they would try it with a fill in vocalists ( well Vegas wouldn't want it but you know what I mean), or three guitarists and 2 keyboard players to fill in for the Edge. I wonder what Adam Clayton thinks about not having his rhythm section partner. Speaking of which, bassist are another victim (for lack of better word) of this kind of thing.
Beloved Rick, I really think you are exaggerating about that. I mean, yes the bands should be considered as one. But if someone has health issues it's not that questionable to replace for just one gig. No one can ever know the desire of the other members to play their songs and communicate with their audience, and they have every right to do so. Now, U2 have sold out their heart and soul long before, that's my opinion, and that apple thing very rightfully drawn the global hate towards them because it was so so so offensive. But the replacement thing is not for us to judge. It would be different if they replaced their drummer for other than health reasons.   The artists in general should have the right to do whatever move needed to transmit their signal, that's not for the audience to judge. Even if they did that gig all four of them, it would also be a sell out. They have made a very conscious decision to prioritize money over music, that's the critique, not their internal decisions. They have altered the context of the message they try to send to the audience over the years with the perspective how to make more money. That's the sellout. And they are all four responsible about that.  You refer to John Lennon, but there can be no similarity. He wanted to transmit the truth from his songs at all costs, being the most successful person in music ever. He risked everything for that.  Of course, Rush let's say, would never have a concert other than an honourable concert to Neil without him, but they have kept true to themselves throughout the whole journey. Freedom of choice without judging from the audience is one thing, and sell out is another. And by the way, sell out is not changing the style etc, because that is natural progression. Genesis made spectacular albums after Peter Gabriel's departure. Peter Gabriel did as well. Genesis split and that was for good as it turned out.  Anyway, change is good, sellout is bad, that's my point.
I agree Rick, Larry Mullen Jr is an essential part of what makes U2 great. But unfortunately we live in a time where swapping or exchanging key members of bands is not seen as a big deal anymore. It’s sad. People now pay big money to go see what is essentially a tribute band with maybe one original member and nobody cares!  I also think your point about the new manager wanting to make money is a key part of this decision. Great video
Sorry, Rick, but having watched this band since the initial album release, I don’t believe you are sufficiently presenting the reason that Larry isn’t going to join the band in Vegas. It’s entirely possible that he has a chronic illness & withdrew himself from the gig.  In addition, U2 may be paying him his share of the money for the Vegas residency. My point is, you shouldn’t rant until you know about the situation. BTW, Look at Spinal Tap! Their drummers died during each gig! 😉
Dear U2, respect the drummer. Rush broke up when they lost Neil. Rush may be my personal favorite, but U2 sometimes gets in my number 1 spot. I'm in no way a non-fan. I've been listening to U4 4ever.
Undersigned. When wraparound screens and fancy shaky seats in Vegas become more important than your 43-old band mate. They've lost it.
It's probably a bit more nuanced than it seems and a tour must involve a fairly long-term commitment of stage design and general production. I'm sure they didn't originally plan to play without Larry. The irony here is that the ultimate four piece band once did a tour, or at least some dates (in Australia I think) without Ringo, due to tonsillitis. They replaced him with a guy called Jimmy Nicol. He's actually mentioned briefly in Get Back. Being a total Beatles geek, I picked up on it.
Couldn’t agree more with you. Been a fan since 1995.
"What are you thinking?" could define the last 20 years of U2. I say this as a massive fan in 90s/00s.
I still have the U2 album on my iPad... Never understood how it came there, until today.
Everyone seemed to think that the Rolling Stones couldn't replace Charlie, either. Steve Jordan was the guy they all knew could pull it off. The difference, obviously, is Larry will be back! Let's see how this resolves, at least U2's temp drummer is a lifelong fan of their music, and passed the auditions.
Love your passion, but I don’t really agree with you here. When a band becomes iconic, yes, all the members are icons. But when you really boil it down, for the vast majority of fans of these huge bands, the band = the song catalogue and the singer, and often the guitarist or other prominent lead instrument. Right or wrong, drummers and bass players  - crucial and talented as they may be - can be replaced with fans barely even noticing. If Edge and Bono could play a residency with session players, call it U2, and fans would show up. That’s just the reality. And it’s not for me to judge whether that’s right or wrong.
Pretty much the same thing as if Rush started a residency without Neil
Pop is a very underrated album RICK!!!🎸❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
🤑
"Get off my Strip!"🤣🤣🤣
As a U2 fan since the first album (saw them for the first time in 1982) I subscribe every single word you say, Rick. And would add: Larry Mullen Jr. is the rock that’s been keeping U2 together for a long, long time. I didn’t ear anything about this residence without Larry and I’m shocked. Is it money? Naaaa! Something else really wrong is going on.
I do not like the shoulders that are rubbed by Bono. Plus his own activities are not my liking too. And their last 'Experience' album looks like written by others (check the names on credits). Actually Experience is the perfect U2 album. As brand. But mainly others work I suspect.
Just another reason for all the rest of us to hate U2 🤑
They had to get a dutch drummer for tax reasons (U2 company is located in the Netherlands) next step, the edge will be replaced by a ukelele player from the kayman islands.
TooL
BONO is a disgusting little man...hey Bono, leave those kids alone
I love U2. Been a fan since 1981.  I agree with you 100%.
It's not U2 minus any member of U2.
honestly, why all this fuzz? Only twice before has the band taken stage without all four members — when Clayton missed a gig in Australia for health reasons in 1993, and after Mullen broke his foot in a motorcycle accident in 1978, according to Bono’s book, “Surrender.” THEY DID THIS BEFORE. TWICE
Without Larry they will just be U1.
I remember the opening of the Achtung concert—Zoo Station, when the first crash hit, all the lights went on, I still get chills thinking about it.
Absolutely agree! Cheers, Tamas from Hungary, fan since 1987 (from age 11!)
This was one of your best videos Rick.  While I love your theory and musical insight, this showed Rick-the-deep-fan on full display, unadulterated. Pure Rick U2 Roll.
Rico I love you
used to love this band...by about 2005 I couldn't stomach them anymore.. achtung baby will always be one of my favorite albums ever...touring without Larry...nah
They will tour with or without you especially now that they are down a couple million from a Super Bowl ad.
Bang on the money, Rick!
what's the problem! He is having surgery, and he is cool with it
The band said to Larry..we are doing this “ with or without you”….
7minutes to ask why larry isn't gonna stay in vegas.  maybe larry thinks thats too boring. he likes to see the world.  it feels like work when he has to be in one spot for that long?
From “Drummer seeks musicians to form band.” in 1976 To “Musicians seeks drummer to form something stupid” in 2023
The root of the problem is: U2 are all about $$
Just wait to play utill larry hs recovered completely - or dismantle the bomb. You are rich enough
What I thought was weird is the sole idea of Las Vegas residency. That smells like a decline, sell - out and cheap cabaret.
I reckon it's called contractual commitments :)
ya this is like if the Beatles would have toured without Ringo in the day.
bad step for U2...
Perhaps a band isn't that different from a company, where people can be replaced by others who fit the culture and have the right capabilities and personality. To replace the one(s) who comes up with the ideas (songs in a band) and vision is the hardest or impossible. Artists like Frank Zappa and James Brown completely changed their bands from time to time, but because of the direction they gave and their songwriting, they remained recognizable.
Rick, '92 veterans stadium, I was there also. Second night. Seen them also at JFK stadium Philly in '87. I was 16. Been a fan since the first time I heard and seen "Two Hearts.." on the MTV.  Boy-Zooropa, should have called it there.  IMO
the fill in better be one in 10,000 damn good- and indistinguishably able to mimic Larry
U2 is one of the most repulsive bands of all time.
You missed the point that they want to take the opportunity to be the opening Act of "The Sphere", and will do only 12 Shows in Las Vegas, and then in 2024 will go on the Road WITH Larry.
Absolutely agree. Been a fan since Boy. Saw them 2 days before my high school graduation in 1983, War tour. Red Rock's era. Then I saw the SB commercial and told my wife we should plan to see the band. Relatively excited. Found out "Larry's Band," as Bono refers to the band, would not have Larry in the band. No longer interested in seeing this band, not Larry's Band. Good luck, guys. You'll make money. Just not including mine.
Wow! Who a thunk that U2 would go down KISS Blvd?
I was at that ZooTV Sydney show early 93 that was filmed and you can see on Youtube. Incredible.
U2 without Larry Mullin Jr. is not U2, it’s something else..
Money makes the world go round
They're not really going out to see people, they're letting people come see them while they stay in a place that's unaffordable to visit for most of the planet.
No Larry = no ticket for me
This is how I feel about the Stones. The band really changed when Wyman left in 1991-92 (no offense to Darryl Jones) and when Charlie died, they should have stopped. Steve Jordan is a basher, which suited Chuck Berry,  but he lacks Charlie's delicacy. He isn't Charlie. And the Stones are no longer the Stones; they are the Mick 'n Keef Show, and Keith can hardly play any more. It's heartbreaking.
Sounds like Larry participation in the band has come to end. Whether its health related or he just is no longer interested, Im sure he gave his blessing to the others to go out and play.  His drumming style is not a Charlie Watts style, it has taken a physical toll.
I totally agree ; to me it's just like coming out with a big Led Zeppelin reunion gig without Robert Plant, or Iron Maiden anxiously seeking for a concert, but without Steve Harris.. Sometime it shouldn't be just about money...
Is Tyrion Lannister the replacement drummer?
I've known and listened to U2 since I can remember being me. I'm 34 and I consider being listening to them for at least 33 years. When I first heard about Larry's health situation I thought: "Well, I guess this is it, it's been a hell of a ride". And then this. That's completely BS.   Btw, even being a fan I hated that thing with Apple Tunes and deleted the album from there too.
Larry Mullen Jr. Is the best part of the band . No band without him
just to give you a little different perspective....I was furious when the put the U2 tracks on my iPhone. I was furious because my phone was FULL and they deleted other music off my phone to add the U2 tracks. The tracks they deleted were MY OWN MUSIC, I am a hobby music producer and had mostly my own music on my phone. Of course the tracks they deleted were NOT iTunes or music I paid for so they picked those songs to delete. So Apple deleted my own music I created and replaced it with that U2 crap. I WAS a U2 fan until that day, that was a crappy set of tracks. I have NEVER trusted Apple again, it's when i realized I don't own my Apple hardware. It was so bad they eventually completely changed how iTunes works.
as a longtime U2 fan too .. i couldnt agree more with your opinion ... that its the same as mine ...  but .. .i have a theory ...  Larry wont come back, he's leaving ....  the (old) U2 i've always knew ... would NEVER ever ... ... start a NEW ... world tour ... ... without all the members available ... if they thought it was momentarily ... never ...  They know Larry wont comeback ....   Songs of Ascending ... was planned to be the last of the triology ... SOI + SOE + SOA ... this trilogy would tell us the Begining of the band (SOI) + the adult fase of the band (SOE) and goodbye (SOA) and we would have the EPIC bands farrewell (to recordings)  ... now Bono decided to do SOS (songs of surrender a cover album of their own songs) and wants to do a Rock n Roll album before SOA ...  Larry ... recorded SOA ... and now ... he might think ... ok .. its enough ... this might never stop ... its time to take care of myself ... see ya ...  eheheh ... thats my understanding ...
I'd put Mullins up there with Ringo for original raw genius percussion.
Here in the Netherlands yesterday all over the news dutch drummer of the band Krezip is gonna stand in for Larry Mullen jr in Las Vegas during his recovery from surgery.I'm actually happy for the guy.But you are right if this was not planned like one  or half a year ago
U3/4
Nothing says Rock N Roll like a money grab in the capital of poor taste and gambling addiction.
So U2 are doing some big stadium gig somewhere and Bono calls for silence. Single spotlight on him. He claps his hands once. A few seconds pass. He claps his hands again. A few seconds pass. He claps his hands a third time. Then he speaks. "Every time I clap my hands, a child in Africa dies." Silence. Then, from the audience, a loud Irish voice rings out: "So stop fuckin' doin' it then!!".
At 4:37 there is an edit- you can see the 335 in the background changes position.  PROOF that Rick is actually in that room
Still haven't found their nookie bar.
Time moves on, People fall by the wayside. Life happens. Rock or Bust....
Bro just shitting all over the hightlight of some drummr's career
Vegas?  U2 in Vegas?  Sure.  It has the infrastructure for an elaborate show.  No doubt there is a ton of $$ to be made.  But U2 in Vegas?  Their beloved audience has to go to Vegas?  ... to see U1.5 ... without LMJr?  Why not Branson, MO or Dubai for that matter?  Money, money, money, mon-ay.  The least they could have done would have been to do the residency in a place off the capitalist grid.... take a chance and develop some sort of alternative residency that is sustainable.  Practice what you preach boys.  It would require more work on your parts, but it would be the right thing to do.  Vegas and U1.5 are just plain wrong.
Its only one gig. Drummers get old , get ill. thats life. People leave bands and get replaced and carry on. Larrys not a robot.
Rick, dude, the Rolling Stones are still calling themselves the Rolling Stones without Charlie Watts. The Who have been The Who without Moon for 45 years. I don’t think this is a big deal. But Given the content of the album they’re releasing, it’s seems like they’re done creatively but the record company won’t let them admit it.
I have been a huge fan since 1986..I was there in Bombay concert on their last tour...but it's hard to imagine the band without Larry.. after all he is the backbone...!
Spot on Rick … Larry has always been the conscience of the band … he is fine and could play but doesnt want to become a Vegas lounge act  … who would blame him … what a way to ruin the legacy of their best album ever
The Who come to mind
Right on it !
Totally unrelated to the topic here, but the lighting in this video is terrific.
So much for nostalgia. This is business with lot's of peoples jobs involved. The drummer can't drum. It speaks for the band they find a solution. Like, you don't have to go to visit that show, if you don't like to see another person on drums. It not they announced Larry's absence, when tickets were already sold.   Or would you like that your 3.35M subscribers tell you, what you can and can't do in your life, relations and business opportunities? I don't think so.
U2  should have packed up years ago
Spot on Rick. Its not U2 with or without one of them. Also to me if you haven’t experienced Achtung Baby you should not call yourself a U2 Fan.
For what it's worth, am remembering they played the first of the Sydney '93 gigs (the ones that became the ZooTV DVD) with Adam's bass tech standing in, dressed up as much as poss to make it hard to realise it wasn't in fact a certain Mr Clayton, after Adam went on his last big bender and was too broken to play the first gig. This residency thing is a different kettle of fish (and to be honest, the idea of U2 being a residency band doesn't feel right to me but c'est la vie) but I guess I'm just thinking it isn't the first time one of the band hasn't been able to take part in a big commitment, although different reasons etc. I dunno - at some point they're going to eventually have to call it a day and if Larry's health isn't great for the future, maybe this is where the swansong starts. As others have said, this residency is doubtless a big contract that can't be put back or pulled out of for financial reasons so they had to find a solution to replace Larry for the duration... all good things etc.
U2 was done after the release of POP. After that, they just floundered around. Their albums became long-winded snoozefests.
Ah Vegas, Where once promising careers go to die.
Haha, "Get off my grass!"😆
This is bad, but not as bad as the "Queen" without Freddie and John
Whats to get worked up about ? Everyones at it ....... Thin Lizzy, Reo Speedwagon, Journey, Fleetwood mac .... Im waiting for 'The Police' to swap Andy Summers, then we'll have the Full Set !
Beatles did part of a tour without Ringo once, when he got sick suddenly and couldn’t play for thirteen days in 1964–John, Paul, George, and Jimmy Nicol.  Gave him a mop top, a suit, and off they went. Weird, but they honoured their contract too.
Yes Rick, you are entirely correct. My first U2 show was at Long Beach Arena in November '84. I've seen them 6 times since all over the world. I would not bother seeing this residency in Vegas. No Larry no band.
If it has Larry Mullen Jnr's blessings or not, to me that's what makes the difference. Charlie Watts was and is absolutely irreplaceable yet the Stones roll on.
I`m more shocked about them re-recording and releasing an album of  re-recorded songs that sound like elevator music or some bad muzak crap.
You are damn right.
Think you're right, Rick, just won't be the same.
Emerson, Lake and Palmer replaced Carl Palmer with his blessing for one album because he was still had commitments with Asia. I am sure that when Larry Mullen Jr. is ready to come back he will.
Man..Rick I’d lox to hear your opinions on the album Pop. I think is quite literally U2’s most underrated and misunderstood albums
I'm sorry it's not U2. No Interest. You talking to someone that saw U2 on the war tour and unforgettable fire tour.
How dare you question the U2
One must not forget that even that madly popular and inseparable (at the time) unit The Beatles had to play part of a world tour in 1964 without Ringo. So one can't be too critical on that account. However, my main comment relates to the mere fact of a group like U2 contracting into a Las Vegas residency. Not just a U2 issue of course, but it can only be because it is much cheaper and you make more money when the fans to travel to see you rather than you going to entertain them where they live. A (dollar) sign of the times I suppose.
Seems to me a "residency" in Las Vegas is associated with some kind of "entrapment" and leads to a death spiral. Elvis, Wayne Newton (Yeah he is still doing it, has plenty of money, but look at him! Why is he still out there until he dies on stage??) Sinatra and so many others. I agree.... REALLY?? How rich, or popular you are has nothing to do with the types of contractual entrapments artists have always fell prey to. It extends beyond just artists to political figures, or just about anyone with any influence if they are not extremely guarded and protective of themselves. The new management deal, loss of the founder, blah, blah. This industry is worse than ever. Try dealing with music on TikTok. If you think Spotify sucks, TikTok will have you screaming, including the stuff they shove in your face....
Having played U2 music for the last 20 years of my life, there is no way this guy is gonna hack it. It’s another them trying to be hip choice. Honestly after seeing them play streets in 2010 with edge, muse’s drummer would have been a better choice.
Rick can I take it your not keen on them doing this. 😂😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿👍👍👍🥃Respect to you mate
Larry is to U2, what Benny and others are for Motown
We've all heard Rush without their original drummer and know how that turned out!
not so much worried about Larry taking a break.  But, a vegas residency.....?
Sorry , but Rattle and Hum is there best album , general public hardly knew u2 before that album , just sayin
After 50-years of wildly swinging sticks around his wrists, elbows, and shoulders might be blown out like a MLB pitcher might be after a their career.
This is only the reflection of the era we live in ... Hyper corporate capitalism  . . Too much money destroys humanity. No one is immune . Not even Godlike Bono and Co. . . .  Simple as that.
Bram van den Berg fills in for Larry Mullen, Bram is a drummer from the Netherlands he plays in the band Krezip
So….don’t attend
U2 should just stop. Their last album was a disaster with only a few rays of light. People go Toto play Vegas gigs when they are desperate for attention. Sad thing is, people will go and witness the legendary band’s self destruction.
i always hated u2.  as a drummer, now i REALLY hate u2.  i guess bono is living up to his reputation of being number 2
I really think this has to do with contract obligations and their management pushing them. There are a lot of people involved. Does not make it ok but usually thats what does it. At first they thought Larry would make it but after time progessed it turns out he needs an operation. I am afraid Larry  is not coming back anymore. its a sad moment.
Larry is having shoulder surgery, U2 fans have known this for a while, as well as we knew about the Superbowl ad announcing Las Vegas shows, the ad cost 7 million dollars.  Lots of U2 fans are whinging about no larry, maybe live nation are making them do it??   I
I agree. Tacky doing a residency in Vegas too. They seem to be following in Elvis' footsteps. Sad.
I wonder if they were under contractional obligation before he found out he could not play it.
Watch your words Rick. The 'some fill-in guy' is one of the best drummers in the Netherlands (my home country). Give him a chance to prove he's worth it. It's only for a short period of time, so you'll be seeing Larry within not too long again. No need to get upset... 🙂
Achtung Baby for me is one of the best records of all time and the one that influenced me the most. And it's not just the songs, it's the sonics too. To me, it always sounds like the Berlin of the early 90's resonating with the Berlin of the 20's and 30's. The Fly must have one of my favourite guitar solo's of all time. It's not a difficult solo in terms of notes, but the sound is sheer genius. I still try to capture that exact sound on my guitar to this day. No idea how they got that sound on the record.
How about Rolling stones
I felt the same when AC/DC kept touring without Malcolm.
U2 jumped the shark many years ago.
Weird busines move by bono I guess, it's strange that Only now I'm hearing about Larry, I hope he's okay
I love dynamics of the lighting and the framing of Rick in his studio. Looks fantastic
I have all their albums (CDs).  I saw their concert at U of O with Rage Against the Machine opening. They should not play without Larry.
I don't really understand the saltiness about this. As far as I can tell, you don't know anything about the business decision going into this. U2 is a business after all, that's pretty clear by now. These shows have been years in the making, I'm sure there were obligations. Why make assumptions? You can't get all entitled because of how long you've been a fan of a band. I haven't seen all of your videos, but from what I have seen, you have no issues with tracks that were recorded with session musicians filling in for whomever, and actual studio recordings will live on in history more than any one live show would. Also, you know nothing about how the temporary drummer is going to approach this, give him a chance. I love they picked a relatively unknown drummer for his chops, instead of one of the same faces you always see in rock, it's an awesome opportunity that I'm sure he deserves. There is no reason to assume Larry isn't coming back. This is just a weird take.
Well, if the Stones did replace Charlie Watts, then everything is possible… But I totally agree, one should know better when to call it quits.
Come on man...U-2???...Really? I would suggest you give your head a good shake...They certainly have the means, maybe they should 'hologram' LARRY for the Big Vegas Show! Or, better yet, they should stay home and 'hologram' the whole damned thing...Ever heard of the band The Pop Will Eat Itself? Death and decay are part of Life, Rick...be thankful...😎
Hey Rick - although I kind of like the idea of album tours, you’re right- sometimes you need to know when to ride off. I saw Black Crowes at the Peach in 22. I’ve been a fan since Money Maker. Heck, those were my college days, hard to believe I remember them. Anyway, they were practically inaudible as they blasted through their set. Definitely wish I caught them earlier. And, like you, I saw U2 in their prime and hearing it wasn’t complete left me feeling like it wouldn’t be worth the price of admission, whatever that ends up being. “Yeah, I saw U2 in Vegas. Well, it was without Larry Mullen, so….”
Dear Rick. If you are so kind to everybody to the lvl that one cannot say whether is it true or not, please don't make shitstorm and leave U2 by its own.
AC/DC did it. Has he not got a bad back? If he is not able too or can’t in the future then why not. Yes important but lots of bands have lost drummers, the Foo’s the Who. Led zeppelin to name a few. U2 write in an unusual way where they jame something up until it becomes a song so this might change but why not.  Relax
I'm a massive U2 fan and can't wait to see what the replacement drummer will bring to the mix, let's not dismiss a fellow musician like this. "Some fill in guy" feels a bit brutal to describe somebody who is probably a hugely talented musician and who is probably ecstatic to be playing with such high level musicians. Probably a dream come true! Larry and U2 are eternal, when I saw Bono alone doing his surrender tour he wasn't Bono, he was all of them. They have a trust and love that is rarely seen in this world and sometimes you have to trust when you are really up against it. Their love is a true example of non dualism and I find it hugely emotional and empowering. Walk on chaps, this will be probably one of their greatest shows ever!
Rattle and hum is my favorite album by them. How is that a misstep!?
Agree 100%. His feel and subtlety can't be replicated.
My opinion? You're fu***ng right, that's my opinion.
I love U2 and I agree with you Rick.
Shouldn’t happen, very lacking, it’s a band or it isn’t and without Larry Mullen on the gig it’s not U2, not a nice thing to do.
The problem will be... The contracts were signed years ago...and openings are only at the door opening. So they have to play. Even though larry already knows he won't be fit...
Lol that itunes thing was retarded and super annoying. I never really use apple music, so I had no other music in that app. But my iphone started automatically playing that album sometimes when connecting it to a car audio system or in some other cases, which made me hate it to the extreme. So no this isn't just a matter of "just not playing it".. For some reason, some years after this epic mistake, some fools decided to do exactly the same with a (pretty good) song of the arctic monkeys that started playing every time I connected my phone to a van we rented for a holiday trip. I hate that song so much ever since..
Crazy idea, easily postpone the dates until Larry's ready to go again
OTOH, if they *did* reanimate Bonzo, there's 3 other guys who'd like to catch up with him first 🙂
I'm not sure what this rant is really about... Larry Mullen Jr. is injured in a way that affects his drumming. He is still in U2, loves his bandmates, wants them to tour... but can't play with them for now because he needs to heal. What are you objecting to...? That he isn't playing while injured? This makes no sense
I saw U2 supporting the Police at Gateshead stadium in 1982. Now they are doing a residency in Las Vegas. Oh dear.
I appreciate Rick's love of original lineups, but stuff happens, and although band changes break your heart when you are young, you learn to roll with it as you get older.  Lineup changes do ruin some bands, though. Since they are only playing one album, 99% of fans wouldn't have even noticed.
Managers are Dumbasses.  Unless "Some Fill-In Drummer Guy" is Dave Grohl, or they somehow managed to reanimate Bonzo, fuhgeddaboudit!
I must admit that I am not a huge U2 fan. My favourite albums are The Joshua Tree, released when I was 15, Achtung Baby and that is basically it. I did like Rattle&Hum when it came out, but not any longer. Regardless of all that, what immediately comes to mind after watching this video is a big WTF@#!!Blitz, and more that I will leave on my mind. This is not how things are done. It is a tremendous error and, for a band fighting for human rights, it shows one of the big flaws of human nature. Very disappointed. Thank you  Rick, as always, you are huge.
Most people don't care who the drummer is. Maybe U2 fans are different...?
Bono´s a tool
1) Rick you’re absolutely bang on. Enough is enough… 2) The replacement drummer is a nobody from the Netherlands (big news here). No idea how he got the gig.  3) Think the biggest issue is the lack of new acts… if there would be another band like these old ones, people would go and see them. But there just isn’t… 4) And yes, without Larry there is NO U2…
Pantera Reunion
I've seen lots of (metal) bands that played since the early 80s with new musicians. Sometimes temporarily. It was never a problem to me. Why rant before seeing the show? Maybe this guy is awesome at it. Or maybe he is in his way good enough. I really do not understand what you are going on about. I agree with the advert with people loving the Achtung Baby album but then again it is marketing and isn't that always stupid?
I would love one of U2 to respond and maybe get the ball rolling for an interview for Rick with them! 🤞🏻An epic band.
Looking at that thumbnail and I for one was impressed that Tyrion Lannister got the drumming gig for U2's residency!
sincerely, I don't understand what is the problem. Larry Mullen has some medical issues (we all hope that it's nothing serious) and the band is returning to perform live after a long stop... it's not the first time and it will be not the last time for a rock band to temporarily substitute a member.  Maybe the real problem is that everything U2 (and Bono in the first place) does in recent times is hipercriticezed... just relax a bit, people: they have more than 40 years of career on their back and they can't be the same that they were in the 70ies and 80ies...
I guess they are gonna play, With or without him. ;-)
No Larry, no U2. Just a copy without him.
Yap, doing karaoke exclusively U2 hits every day... all I want is U2...
I'm not a big U2 fan, but I loved Achtung Baby. That, and to a slightly lesser extent Zooropa, was the U2 album for people like me that weren't so keen on the band's earlier work.  I agree with you that it's a big drum record. I don't' doubt that there are drummers out there that could replicate LM's work on that record – but I think people would prefer to see the original line-up in a show like this.  What's the rush? Fans have waited this long… why not hang on until Larry is match-fit again?   And if his health problems are severe enough to prevent him from playing a regular kit in the long term, maybe he should take a leaf out of Rick Allen's book and integrate the playing with some cutting edge technology; of all the albums in U2's canon, Achtung Baby would lend itself very well to that approach.
Zoo Station has one of the best lyrics in music imo. "Time is a train, makes the future the past. Leaves you standing in the station, your face pressed up against the glass". Ranks right up there with Billy Joel's "they're sharing a drink they call loneliness, but it's better than drinking alone".
What's ridiculous is you thinking you can dictate U2 how they go about their career. You have no inside information on how they made the decision to do these shows, but yet, like everyone else you run your mouth. That is ridiculous. Unless Larry comes out saying it's absolutely against his will and that he's deeply upset that they do these shows without him, everyone really should just shut the fuck up.
"Our fans are like the fifth bandmember" "we want to see their faces". Jeez, Bono clearly didn't stop being a pompous twat did he? You're doing it for money, everyone knows that, so just shut up...
U2 are all about the money and Bono's ego is a driving factor. Yes they've done some good songs over the years but they're no rolling stones, LED Zep, Pink Floyd etc.. It was time to give it up decades ago. IMO They are, at best average.
You never know. As unlikely as it is, the new guy or guys might be really good. 🙏
100% agree. Unfortunately the rumours around Dublin was there's been a disconnect within the band. I wouldn't be surprised if Larry's 'op' means he can't play anymore...
This gives me Guns n Roses vibes. U2 has not made a great album since Dismantle. Clearly they are in their hasbeen era and as a fan I am not even sure I would pay to see them live here anno 2023. Especially if band was not intact. Just like with GnR. Those bands were my everything once along with Pearl Jam and Radiohead. Nowadays only Radiohead are still exciting and relevant.
Larry mullen is all that you can't leave behind, U2 ARE BONO THE EDGE ADAM AND LARRY! This concert is something ridiculous! I have been following U2 since 2001 when i was just 12,  this is the first time i don't feel like listening to their "new" album and their shows! I feel betrayed!
Def Leppard waited for years for their drummer to recover from a car crash
Of course, nobody is being told the real story. There'll be more to this than an just an old man cash grab.
U2 beats to a different drummer
They're early 60's. Things happen. We don't all age the same.  I've not read anything about him being out of the band. Maybe he is sick. Maybe he does have issues.  So one guy can't make the gig the band is done forever?  Lots of bands replace guys after years and years. Led Zeppelin did it with Bonham.  Queen did it with Freddie Mercury.  Def Lepard did it with Savage? I can't remember which one died.... Megadeth does it every 3 weeks with all the members.
It is drummer Bram van den Berg from a Dutch mediocre band called Krezip, he is also a very mediocre drummer in my opinion. Of course we should give him a chance, but I don't understand the choice at all.
I totally agree... No Larry, no party
Love U2 music, hate Bono. He's a satanist who collaborates with peadophiles and crooks. Horrid man. Shame he was groomed so much by the Clintons and co back in the day, big shame.
Was hoping after the rant you would look into the drummer that will replace Larry mullen jr. Would love to hear your opinion about him.😉
U2 without Larry Mullen Jnr,, is kinda like saying The Egde can’t play rhythm guitar.. I respect Rick’s outrage.  Someone needed to say it
ZooTV was a fun tour. For me, Achtung Baby was there last really great album. They've had good songs since then but no great albums. All albums prior to Achtung are just so d*mn strong.
They remind me of Aerosmith, making tons of money, residency in Vegas, leaving drummer behind...
They should change the singer😂
U2 hasn't played live since December 2019 ? Woah, it means that show was in Mumbai - Dec 15, 2019. So lucky that I was there to see the original line-up for probably the last time ever ?
I remember seeing them in 1982 in Knoxville when they were backing up J Geils. We went to the concert to see U2 and they were great. In ways, I like the early stuff the most.
I did not quite get this rant. Is it a click-bait?  Any band like that is also a commercial project, an enterprise. Why should they not maximize the profits? Really, it is their business, not ours. And no one is forcing you to go to a concert in Vegas. If you do a good product it sells itself and the law of supply and demand take care of the rest. The music has its beyond-money-value. That will stay even when we are gone. Im sure Mullen gets something out of this too and maybe he is not against it if it is the will of the three other members. No band is a God. Remember the quarrels in Eagles. None of that is our business. Our, fans, business is to enjoy the music.  I dont get this…
Playing in Vegas is the musical version of being put out to pasture.  Kudos to Sting and Beatles for not dragging their fans into such an embarrassment.
While they were at it they should have asked our Rick to replace Mr Three Chords and an Echo Pedal 🙂
The last time they played live was Dec. 2019. Larry had over three years to get his surgery done , so now he decides to do it. Larry said recently , if you not going to have fun going out on tour then why do it.
Well said. I've been a fan since 1981. It is so unfortunate, to say the least!
My assumption with this is that they were contractually obligated to perform and couldn’t delay it any longer - sphere’s launch has been in the works for a long time.   Think they may also go the Tipton in Priest route if Larry’s health doesn’t stabilise - still a full member of the band in studio - but only makes guest appearances live. I think most fans would live with that.   Also think a lot of younger U2 fans would love AB above all! I’m 30 - grew up with them as musical background noise. When I became a bigger fan (in 2014) and started exploring their back catalogue beyond what was on the radio it was their 90s records I loved the most - Pop and Zooropa!  The other aspect is that it definitely feels like Bono is becoming a more dominant personality in the band again - the two ‘songs of’ albums feels like Bono solo albums. Experience in particular sounded like it emphasised Bono’s vocals first, then production FX, and only then the actual band’s music.
I would prefer it if they do the gigs without Bonio...and the Edge....and Adam Clayton too...then Pearl Jam could do the shows.
Bobo is a breadhead. Didn't you know?
u2 is only ruled by money for decades… Achtung Baby was there best LP. Now it’s only business unfortunately
I’m surprised Rick didn’t mention the connection between this Vegas “residency” and the awful idea that is this Songs of Surrender album out in March.    If the 3 or 4 songs already released are anything to go by, this is going to be shockingly poor album. Who in the world wanted a collection of 40, yes 40! dull, mumbling versions of their own songs stripped of the passion, atmosphere and creativity that made them great in the first place?   It’s no surprise Larry isn’t part of this Vegas cash grab, given the entire rhythm section seem to be missing on the Surrender album!  I’m curious to see just how many of these “reimagined” versions are performed live in place of the original songs in the Vegas shows?  Bono’s voice has long been far from what it was, and I have the horrible feeling these half-mumbled talky-singing versions are all he can manage live now.  This could be easily performed by just Bono and Edge, and I think going forward this might be what the band become.
I agree it’s like when I c the Rolling Stones great band and u2 a like . But it’s time to retire my god I’m watching grandad on stage how much money do they need lol😂
Well said Rick. In just under 7 minutes you've changed my opinion from "Oh, ok, Larry's not there" to "Hang on, he's right, what ARE they doing?", and that's because your approach is so consistently enthusiastic (and informative) that when you have something specific to say (like this) it carries some weight. You are rapidly becoming the voice of reason (so be careful, ha ha).
Remember the Simpsons episode? Adam: ”Can I come?” (to Moes for a pint) Edge: “No” Adam: “Wankers”  Maybe they should have gone without Adam instead.
I can't help feeling that Achtung baby is their best album... one of the best albums that came out in those years at all. Not a single song an that album disappoints and I bet I will still listen to it when I'm old(er) lol.
I can definitely see where you're coming from, but these guys love to play live and bottom line love music and love their fans. I know the chemistry of the unit and that magic of the four of those guys playing together won't be the same, but this will still be a great show that I would gladly part with my hard earned money to see. And as for the guy who will be playing with them also, please give him a chance. He has big boots to fill, but don't disrespect him and refer to him as 'some drummer' before you have heard him play with them. I'm sure he is a top notch musician and will do just fine. U2 are so meticulous about how things sound that they would never have got to this point without trying it out already and saying to themselves "that sounds and feels good". Please just give it a chance before writing it off.
I hear Echo ( of Echo & the Bunny men ) will be sitting in behind the skins.
Disagree. If you're 4th man in bridge is sick, you don't stop playing cards. They want to play some gigs, nothing world changing about that.  Will they be as good as they were? Probably not. But if they want to play their songs to an audience who want to come see it, it's nothing to do with me or with you.
I have to assume that they got far into the planning stages before they realized that Larry would have to sit it out, to the point it was either play with the fill in or scrap the whole plan.
Isn’t it just simply Bono wanting to cash in? I understand that there are big U2 fans out there wanting to believe Bono just wants to get out there to see their faces. I don’t think that’s why they’re doing this. Out of pure love for the band and the fans, they should be there with the proper band.
A great rant Rick. Keep up the good work. Maybe U2 or their manager need the money.
wasn't U2 that band where is was mainly about the money?!
Huge U2 fan also, and I can see why they are doing this. If Larry can't do it because of his surgery, I'm sure he gave his blessing to go ahead- the Sphere opening is going ahead at that date, and they wanted the biggest band in the world, (next to the Stones) so LMJ isn't going to hold his brothers back.
Honestly if Larry ends up saying that he's out I really think U2 should just call it. They've been around long enough and have made lots of great records. The new album sounds interesting but i don't think they're contributing anything to interesting anymore. Just call it a day U2.
U2 have been rubbish since 2000, Bono’s voice is shot.  To be fair Larry’s not a great drummer he’s replaceable from a drum perspective.  The bands fake humanitarian posturing is sickening, look at Bono’s elite friends they are the very definition hypocritical sell outs
I'll admit that I'm probably an edge case (no pun intended), but Achtung Baby was the first album I ever bought as an 8 year old in 2002. Would 100% go watch that show. What a fkn album
The Dutch drummer Bram van den Berg who replace Larry in Vegas , is a great choice!! 👍
There’s a video from irelands national broadcaster titled “u2s Larry Mullen’s acting debut” 2013. It’s a 2 minute piece. Is it possible that Larry has stuck to artistic integrity. As much as I love u2, are they, as he says, still relevant? Or is it just coincidence? I hope you check it out.
they're huge enough and humble enough to sustain over such long periods - I always say the best aspect of Ireland is the people and why they compete so well internationally in things like Rugby union and elsewhere, they have good work and team ethics which has led to their almost uniquely sustained success - unlike so many arenas I ve experienced, these 4 don´t have excessive ego
U3, am I right?
I think it's a contract they can't get out of
Vegas Res = Where musicians go to die.
The Beatles toured Australia without ringo
They reached their peak with the Joshua Tree for me. Some decent songs followed but the only album I have after that is H2DAAB and a compilation set. Didn't really care for the original material on Achtung Baby, it felt disingenuous.
Actung Baby was the last time U2 was great.
Bono takes a leaf from Don Henley's book.....lose an original member?....plug the hole and keep on making money....
I'll be disappointed if Bono isn't wearing a sequined jumpsuit. 😂
Damn right, Rick!
I'm guessing U2 signed the contract for this residency before Larry's health problems came to light and getting out of the contract would have probably set them back millions. I also doubt they're playing these shows with a fill in drummer without Larry's blessing. I worked in music for 10 years. Sometimes you've just gotta make things work because you've already made the commitment and that means you bring in folks to fill in. Soundgarden did several shows of their 2014 tour with NIN without Matt Cameron (and instead used the phenomenal Matt Chamberlain) including the show I saw at the Hollywood Bowl because Matt had commitments with Pearl Jam. Again, you make it work when you have to. It was still an amazing Soundgarden show and a memory I will always cherish. I think this U2 residency will also be  amazing. I doubt they'd bring in a drummer who wasn't fantastic to play such an exceptional album. I saw U2's '92 tour at Dodger Stadium. What an incredible night! Saw the Joshua Tree tour a few years ago, too. I'll be equally enthused to see them in this residency in Vegas.
Rick, love the video’s but in this instance I have to disagree. I was born in ‘95 and Achtung Baby, to be specific, is my fav album of all time (followed by In Rainbows by Radiohead and Synchronicity by The Police). I believe the 30th anniversary of Achtung Baby in ‘21 would’ve had a tour as that’s what a lot of fans wanted, but obviously covid didn’t allow that to happen. I need to see a rendition of Zoo TV in my lifetime and I mean NEED, as I wasn’t born when the original tour happened. And of course I’d prefer it to be with Larry Mullen Jr, as he is indeed a powerhouse and key to the U2 sound. But if I get to see the other 3 perform that magical album, I’ll take it. I’ll also scrape together every penny I can find to travel to LA from the UK. So if there’s even 1 other person in the same boat as I am then I think they’re doing it for the right reasons. And it sounds like Larry was a part of that decision. The band want to record new music, but if the stage production is there for an Achtung Baby tour, it would be a shame if it didn’t see the light of day. Here’s to a speedy recovery for Larry, and hopefully a return to the band sometime soon.  P.S. The songs of Innocence release was a blunder I agree, but it’s actually a fantastic U2 album, invasion of privacy? Maaaybe, but sometimes people can’t see brilliance when it slaps them in the face as a freebie!
Stupid idea U2 . Your a Band that’s been playing for 40 something years with the same line up . All though I was in Australia working with the clash and we supported you guys u2 ,and if I remember rightly Adam didn’t do the Gig . Other than that it’s all was been the 4 of you . Bono your not a solo artist you need your brothers with you . But if Larry is sicker than what they are letting us know well that’s not good . Anyways see how it goes. I’m not a fan of the idea. 👎🏽
I am so glad this wasn't a rant against the replacing drummer himself, my fellow Dutchy Bram van den Berg. Respect.
yeah U2 had its time and they have place in my heart ... better to stop with dignity
I agree, sadly it is time to hang up the mikes and retire gracefully from live shows. Bono has problems with his eyes, Larry clearly has some problems that are maybe more serious than is being reported. Its about dignity. If U2 really want to see the faces of their beloved fans, try some small, intimate gigs in the old-style venues where you really see the whites of the eyes. A glitterball in the sky for an overpaying few is not how to do it. It hurts to say it, as a lifelong U2 fan, but let it go boys.
U2 in two words: FOUR FRAUDS.
It's not like another drummer can't play those tracks.
I seem to remember a massive leg of the 360 tour being delayed for a full year because Bono injured his back and needed surgery. Not sure why they can't postpone or even a cancel these shows for Larry AKA the man that started everything.
Aerosmith did the EXACT same thing.
Second only to Coldplay as the most overrated band on the planet.
Rick, you nailed it.  U2 fan since 1984
U2 WAS amazing. Their newer stuff is just not on par anymore.
James Dolan (Rick might be familiar with the name) is building this 2 billion "state of the art" venue in Vegas. Bono put a book out and one of the venues he was doing a book tour on was The Beacon- which Dolan owns (he also owns MSG, Beacon, Radio City Music Hall, The Knicks, and The Rangers and a couple of other venues and sold off Cablevision for billions of dollars). Bono's one Beacon show wound up in the hands of resellers and the tix were going for crazy amounts of money. Just to watch Bono read from a book! So it's pretty obvious Bono and Dolan are bros, and Bono's pretty much using the U2 brand to help bring people from all over (insert the "if we build it they will come" soundbite). I'm sure Billy Joel will also be playing the Sphere because he locked into a contract with Dolan years ago to do a lucrative MSG residency. This is a powerful guy -he renovated MSG and The Beacon, and basically made the city move the train system around him. He was also in the news for kicking a mom out escorting her kid on a FIELD TRIP to a Rockettes Christmas show - because she also happened to be working for a law firm that's suing him, and identified her with facial recognition software. Scary stuff. Bottom line - Dolan made Bono an offer he couldn't refuse.
Bono is a bread head. Thats the reason
How else is Bono going to pay to fuel the private jet he flies around on to lecture people about global warming?  U2 is a great band, but let's be honest.  How many people have really been sitting around through this whole last 3 years of pandemic yearning for the day when they can spend $500 to go see U2 play again.  Oh, and U2 without it's founding member, and a show focused on one album as well.
Agreed. it's a lame move. not just saying that as a drummer but as a fan. u2 is the 4 of them NOT 3 plus a drummer.
This has been talked about for a while.
First: U2 sucks, has always sucked and will continue to suck forever. Second: That said; nobody is bigger than the band. It’s about the music, not the people.  Third: Larry Mullen isn’t a good drummer, this guy will be just fine.  Oh, and U2 sucks.
REM went on without Bill Barry, but they were sucking by then as well. My bigger U2 issue is the "re-imagined" re-recordings that totally lack any imagination.
I'm just hoping Larry Mullen is ok.  Been a fan of U2 since the Joshua Tree.
I don't know.... This is there job, it's what the love, it's not fair for the rest of the band not to play because Larry can't.  It's fine for six months, but man, it's been 4 years.
Jimmie Nicol is still going strong, perhaps they should give him a call.
The era of the hasbeens has never been this easy... That's why.
Good on ya, Rick. Well said.
On the topic of U2 doing a Vegas residency, Bono will almost certainly bring back Mr Macphisto, who in himself, was a parody of Vegas lounge singers past their prime. The level of irony here is pretty funny.
Saw the original 3 REM members w/ and w/out Bill Beery didn’t even notice difference
No surpise, given the years between albums,  the "acoustic" album about to come out, it seems clear the band has run its course and the tank is dry. Vegas seems like a tacky cash in to me, and I suspect Larry has actaully finally left the band, something hes been contemplating for years apparently. The right thing do is not play the gigs if it is indeeed  Larrys health out of respect to him, but clearly there is none, so they playing it anyway with someone else. Larry's cryptic comments over the last couple of months, certainly seem to indicate some significant differnces of opinion in the band. For me the high water marrk was Unforgettable Fire and Achtung Baby. Shame they couldnt have exited gracefully like REM .....
I love how it sounds like Rick is calling them YouTube. Love listening to Rick.
I don't see a problem. Why shouldn't the other three play together while the drummer recuperates? Don't think its purely a money grab - they want to perform!
what is u2? this band is very overrated. the world pays too much attention to them.
There were always the four and same members over decades. This is why we feel , that's not right. But is it?  I wish U2 all the best . And I hope Larry is doing well.
You are of course free to have your own opinion of any matter, but frankly this is none of your business.  Strange snobbish attitudes like this really sucks. I'm sure there's tons of people out there happy to see them giving again, Mullen or not.
Larry may never play drugs again. He has literally worn out his joints. Very sad.  Bono took full responsibility for the iPhone mis-step in his book, Surrender.
...and Larry is my favorite band member
You can say what you want, as someone from The Netherlands I'm kind a proud a Dutch drummer is going to do it. And I understand the sentiment, "the band is not ... without ...". When Rush's drummer Neil Peart passed away there was discussion if Portnoy could take Pearts spot. As a big Rush fun I think: why not? Portnoy can deliver, he's no Peart but I bet I'd enjoy concerts with him. But many fans were against. It seems like a bit of gatekeeping. Larry Mullen Jr might be the drummer since the start, but if Bram van den Berg can deliver (and I think replacing Larry Mullen Jr won't be as hard as replacing Neil Peart 🤣) and the songs sound like they should... does it really matter? I mean... these halls are so big you can't see the band anyway 😁
I used to be a big fan of you Rick but you turned into an old man yelling at clouds
they want to be rockstars again.   All good
I mean, it’s still Bono and the Edge. What percentage of U2’s fans (aside from hardcore fans) know LMJ’s name? I’d be shocked if it was more than half.
If Larry still gets his cut, he might be happy being sick and still earning
Gonna feature Weyes Blood anytime soon? You're missing out on the finest artist around.
To be fair, this gig has apparently been in the works a very long time. With a contract, designed sets & production, people sub-contracted & everything. The band didn’t plan on doing it without Larry. And I know he’s given his blessing to the other three members to proceed & honor their contract—I just wish if they must preform without any member of the four, that they’d do it under another name. U2 are unique in rock for their longevity & NEVER having any lineup changes for 43 yrs.   It’s a shame, because I love the album Achtung Baby so much. And I still love U2. Legends. GET WELL SOON, LARRY.
BS"D You're a smart guy Rick. It's obviously a money grab. Not worth your mental energy to think about it
Do we know why Larry isn't doing it? What if he is having health problems or just simply doesn't want to do it any longer and the rest of the band do? I get being disappointed that Larry is gone, but I don't understand why they should get crapped on for wanting to play. 95% of U2 fans are going to the show for Bono's vocals and stage presence anyways.
When a band becomes a corp ..... Pathetic
I saw U2  1993 in Oviedo🇪🇦 20 years old Atchung Baby. I was in the first raw in the convert because I spend 12 hours in the street singing with fans Sow them in 1997 in Vicente Calderon Madrid at 24, Pop Mart. The next day I had my last exam of my economics degree, but I sleep in a bus to see them.  In Camp Nou, Barcelona 2003 30 years old, was the last I saw with Keane.  That where the Good U2 times,  I don't like the last albums 30 years later I learn to play guitar and I can do some classic Edge riffs. Buy I guitar and play rock it's never late!! Without Larry Jr its not U2 🤘🤘😎🎸
What's the big deal. U2 played without Bono when he was incapacitated & Chris Martin saved the day!
Maybe Larry wants to cool it.....he has had a very blessed career..it's all the unsung musicians out there that bugs me.
Do we note this as U2-1 or U(2-1)?
Rick, the Las Vegas shows where written in stone and they couldn't get out of it. They had to.
I agree and disagree at the same time. Yes, you can’t replace a single person in that band and have it be the same. Especially the drummer when he’s always been the driving force of the band in my opinion. However, it’s unfair to expect a band that wants to keep going to stop because one person in the band cannot continue. The music is already written. There are many drummers that can replicate the parts needed to perform the songs. In my opinion, performing live is much different than writing songs and having memorable drum parts written for those songs.
I was a fan of U2 until Under a Blood Red Sky. After that, it went all way too jangly and pop. The anger had gone, which may have been understandable, but they lost me
He still going to get paid to sit at home.
WOW... name ONE band that hasn't gone on without an original member.  Its not that big a deal.
KISS fans: first time?
I lived in Vegas for 38 years. I had plates for awhile that were a ref to Achtung Baby. I’ll never forget the one time someone shouted “U2 sucks!” as they drove by. I’m sure that I laughed. I’m laughing now. It’s tough to get me back to that city these days, and without Larry I certainly wouldn’t go to the show. That said, I wish them all the best. They were a big part of my younger days.
Couldn’t agree more Rick!
I saw what I believe was they're 2nd U.S. show in 1978 in think it was.They were very young and had to repeat songs to fill out the set.I definitely remember them playing "I will follow" twice. I've seen a few shows since and a couple of them were monumental.But now I'm pretty much over them especially St.Bono.When I heard they're doing Vegas I thought,how typical.
Irish guy - have seen them 17 times live, seen them in Dub etc. How greedy are they for the dollars that they cant wait a few months for Larry to get better ? Bit disappointed
I was a HUGE fan from the time I discovered U2 in 1982 until "Achtung Baby". That's where they lost me. They became a different band and the change in direction and sound didn't appeal to me. The last U2 album I bought was "Rattle And Hum". They've had a few singles over the years that I've liked...but I've never been inspired to buy an album. I just lost interest....which blows my mind because my main diet during my formative teenage years in the 80's was U2 and The Police.
Dunno, hope they've really thought this through. I get that their itching to play, but there must  be more to the injury than  they're letting on. Getting older and aging joints, tendons, muscles and nerves can get pretty persnickity especially someone who never holds back when plays.
Kinda like seeing Led Zeppelin without John Bonham.. oh, wait a minute 😀
How on earth is Bono's voice going to last for a whole year?
U2 suck, Rick, in every way. Always have, always will.
I can understand why they would go for Achtung Baby for this residency.  It was peak U2.  I loved (most of) Zooropa, but a lot of people counted it as an experimental album and gave them a pass for trying new stuff.  So when you go back and think of U2 at their best, you're easily in the Joshua Tree/Achtung Baby era.  As far as whether this is a mistake, for me, it depends on two things.  One, is Larry cool with it?  Maybe he's going to make it later in the residency.  Maybe it'll be a part of his recovery.  Who knows, but if he really deep down is cool, then I'm cool.    And two, they can't just fill the seat with some session drummer.  They have an opportunity to explore their own music in interesting ways by changing up the lineup.  U2 featuring Dave Grohl?  U2 featuring Danny Carey?  Meg White?  Phil Collins?  Ringo??  There's a lot of potential there, if they take advantage of it.
You know what would fix this??   BONO THE EDGE ADAM CLAYTON RICK BEATO!!!!!
He's an incredible drummer. Amazing musician.
They should change the name of the band to U2-1 (minus one).
I feel your disappointment Rick... but someone once told me  “Taking responsibility means never blaming anyone else for anything you are being, doing, having, or feeling.” These are all grown men aren't they?
I saw them in 1992 , in the front row, together with Velvet Underground. Great Show. But since Bono, this catholic twat, thinks he has to play political left wing activist, they f****in lost it.  Moneymaking c***s!!
so i get that the gig being centered like around an album driven by the drums but without the original drummer is a weird choice to say the least but really after the pandemic and not being able to play gigs in front of audiance like they used to you can't blame them for wanting to do these gigs and yes a key member is not availables because of a surgery but that doesn't that all the other members should not have the right to play live it is certainlyy nott ideal but i mean they are human they are artists and want to play live so i feel this rant is a bit unfair given how many bands replaced musician along the way yes be dissapointed but don't blame them for doing what they love especially if they are still able to do it  side note about thee promotings video yes you might be cynical about the marketin and a new fan isn't like an old fan that was there when the album came out but anyone can be fans and isnt that what you would want to young people still discover older great bands i think if you doubt the legitimity of the people in the video i get it it's marketin but saying that you doubt newer fans love an album that came out in 1991 is not relevant and ridiculous i mean i was born in 1988 and the first artist i fell in love with his music was Chris De Burgh with his art rock masterpiece Spanish Train from 1975 and i'm a huge prog rock fan especially the golden era in the 70s and even my favorite album Kid A from Radiohead came out in 2000 but i discovered it around 2006 so your love for a band doesn't require you to having been there when the album came out ..  sorry i love your videos but i'm nott a fan of rants especially if the argument is not well founded and the main idea that i agree with is that the gig around an album where the drum is so importants without the drummer is indeed not a good choice anyway peace everyone lets enjoy great music
It is like after the How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb tour things got bad. Music not as good anymore (apart from a few songs here and there), bad decision like the iTunes thing... the new re-recorded album is not good at all.... I have no idea what kind of surgery Larry has to undergo... I hope it is not too serious.
U2 without Bono, the Edge or Larry is just not U2.  If it was Adam missing it wouldn't be a huge issue.
Yeah it'll be weird not having Larry in the band doing these shows. But it's not like they're replacing Neil Peart. They'll be fine.
Love your stuff, but had to chime in here -   1. If Larry Mullen Jr is unable to perform at this time, one would have to assume he loves the band too much to want to hold them back. I'm sure he'll return if/when he's able, but you can't bust their chops for trying to keep the flame alight. None of them are getting any younger - if they want to rock, so be it!   2. I happen to know Bram van den Berg and he's not just a 'fill in'. He's been one of the most successful drummers in Holland for decades (while still being pretty young), having headlined arenas (and beyond) with his original band Krezip, as well as The Dutch Queen tribute (that has also played to MANY massive crowds) and lots of other cool projects (including a stint with me about 10 years ago). I fell in love with him at our first soundcheck - he came in prepared and carefree. Bram has pocket for days and an easy-coolness about him that can't be denied. No wonder he got the call! When I started hearing about this from my Dutch peeps (most working musicians) this week, everyone was in agreement that he was a great choice for such an important gig. I truly love L.M. Jr as much as anyone and agree he's an absoltely singular drummer and arranger, but Bram will do everyone proud 100%. Let's wish them success.
In the same times I'm trying to imagine someone ranting over Lars being replaced for Metallica show.
Love Rick and his appreciation for the amazing Larry Mullen Jr. ... And I don't feel the same way he does about this. I've been a fan since 1986 and I'm  incredibly excited and will definitely go and see them open up this amazing new venue in Vegas. I wish Larry could be there, but I'm glad they're doing the shows. My biggest concern is for his health, and I really hope he has a full recovery and can return to touring with the band very soon.
It’s not Bram’s fault. This so called “stand-in guy” is a phenomenal drummer, way too good for this overrated band. I’m happy finally someone like Rick dares to speak: they should have call it a day years ago!
I really don't get all the fuss. The replacement is *temporary* and only for a couple of Las Vegas shows, because Mullen has to undergo back surgery (from Dutch media and Dutch band Krezip  where Bram van den Berg, the drummer who replaces Mullen, is coming from). How many bands temporary replaced members due to all kind of issues, a lot I would say.
Larry is a grown assed man, from Dublin.  Injured he could still flatten basicalliy anyone that looked at him wrong.  Point being.  He's not some fragile little weakling that needs to be stood up for.  The band is playing because he also wanted them to play and he benched himself for the sake of the team.  If you can't play your own material the way it should be played, you'd still want people to hear it.  You just need someone off the bench to fill in for you that gig (or game metaphorically).  Your video feels icky
I saw Zoo TV in ‘92, with Public Enemy and The Sugarcubes. What a blast that was.
didn't this video just slap the face of the replacement drummer who just wants to feed his family by getting the gig? 🤔 ... just my 2cents😁 Rick could've mentioned, "with due respect to the drummer..." or something like that as a disclaimer
Happy to go see them with a different drummer. Would go for Bono and The Edge. Don’t really care who plays the drums and bass tbh.
Rick, did you have the same problem with The Rolling Stones? If they want to go out and play and are able to produce a great product live, do so.   You only live 1 time. Don't hold back. If LMJ gets well and can perform, maybe he could join them again.  I don't see the big deal.
It's weird. My favorite song of all time is by U2 (still haven't found what I'm looking for). Yet, they annoy me as a band.
I'm 36, I've been a fan of U2 since the late 90s...Achtung Baby is hands down my favourite U2 record. Just saying...
Since Larry finds this a good idea why don’t you give Bram a fair chance? The band wants to be on stage again like most musicians 6:48 and I’m sure Bram can handle this. I’m a guitarist from The Netherlands and I know Bram, he’s a great musician!
The name of the fill-in drummer is Bram van den Berg, he plays in the Dutch band Krezip. I don’t know the reasons of U2 to want to play knowing LMJ is not present in Las Vegas…  U2 fans hammer down on Bram since the news was released, which to me is unfair.  You’re right Rick to say “WHY” U2 do you want to do something like this which will surely get a lot of backlash from fans.  His name is Bram 😁 (Greetings from me from NL)
I wouldn't expect anything different from a guy who considers George Dubya as a personal friend. They've been establishment lackeys for quite some time now.
They could use a Roland CR78 CompuRhythm
Next to Roger Taylor, Larry is the coolest rock drummer alive.
Rick, since we are on the subject of touring basically, let’s talk Motley Crüe.  Haha
Well, I remember reading they had a 4 tour contract with live nation back in ‘17 when they started the I+e tour and that was one of the reasons they stuck the Joshua tree tour right in the middle (meaning to fulfill contract stuff). I’m sure live nation is waiting on the rest and this will be part of that. After the pandemic I don’t know if they’ll return to the studio to make more music so it kinda makes sense they’re playing their old material. But as far as timing goes I imagine it just didn’t work out with Larry’s health issues. I Can understand that. What I don’t understand is how U2 having access to any drummer in the world (to fill in for a few gigs) went with someone with such a small resume. I mean, if they had asked Grohl to play with them he’d say yes, Chad smith… yes… freaking ringo! I guess everyone was busy???? Conflicting schedules? But a guy in a band that broke up for +10 years and barely got back in 2019 just doesn’t make sense!
Rick are you seriously saying that those younger fans can't be fans of Achtung Baby because they weren't around?  If so that's some serious gate keeping on your part and pretty damn ignorant.  I hope I'm just misunderstanding what you're saying at the point of the video.
Waaaaaaaa!!!!!!
I agree, I saw the news and thought it was super weird. Las vegas residency time after a few years without hit singles or albums is usually a sign to bow out. Missing a core member is yet another reason to bow out.
Been following U2 since War was released (I was 10). U2 a great band, unbelievable band, creating amazing songs until Zooropa. Then it all went wrong. Before that, every album was worth listening to from first song to last. Since Zooropa, one song, maybe two is worth giving a shot. They lost their way. Their totally unique, raw sound of the early albums being over produced in that period of concept albums of the early 90s. Now I don’t even pay attention when they release/do something new. Muse are in the process of doing exactly the same thing. And then there’s Bono and his soap boxing. Leave that to people who know what they’re talking about.
Yeah.  Dunno about this.  They’ve gone on and on for decades about the band being “sum of all its parts” and whatnot.   Guess the parts are interchangeable.   Lol.
Get off my lawn! 😁
Ah, man. You couldn't find a bigger U2 head than me up until the Pop album. They were dead to me, albumwise, thereafter. And, they continue to disappoint, time after time, with their optics. Tried watching A Conversation With Bono, held at some monumental Catholic church in DC recently, discussing his new book, Surrender. I just couldn't. Just so embarrassing and out of touch with reality. This new move is unsurprising and heartbreaking!
If it was done with Larry's blessing then I have no issue.  If not, then that's pretty shitty.
Happy for fellow Dutchman Bram van den Berg to fill in for Larry, but yeah, it's a shame.
Absolutely agree with you Rick! The chemistry between the band members on stage will be totally different and the music outcome will not be the same as perfect as it used to be.
If The Rolling Stones can play without Charlie Watts, U2 can certainly play without Mullen. For all we know Mullen may have given the band his blessings and when he's ready he'll come back.  This is a non-issue.
Chill, folks. This is due to Larry trying to recover from issues with his back. He hinted in November 2022 that this was coming.
Glad that you mention McGuinness. I remember reading somewhere, that he was considered the "key" member of U2. That has been proven more than correct because since he left it's been a downward spiral for them. The i tunes fiasco, those two albums (that controversial sleeve), the pointblank leftist approach to absolutely everything, something that even permeated all the Joshua Tree anniversary messaging, the unnecesary Songs of Surrender...And now this. I wonder what McGuinness actually thinks of it all. Like you I am a fan of U2 and it's painful to see how they have become like a parody. They ZOO TV parody was genious; this one is for real and it's very sad to see
Rick, U2 may well be the greatest band of all time. But this is really shameful, just unforgivable. If a member of U2 cannot play, then there should be no U2. Thats how this 4 guys shook the world. They are like the Beatles. And Rattle and Hum was a monumental quality record, a masterpiece of music. But to recieve the praise it deserved, it should have been:  1. Desire 2. Angel of Harlem 3. Van Demiens Land 4. Hawkmoon 269 5. Love Rescue Me 6. God Part II 7. When Love Comes To Town 8. All I Want is You  And the live versions (which were amazing by the way) should have been included only in the movie
How many times did Rick say Youtube instead of U2?  Is this his way of doing the "meow" gag?
I'm gonna be totally honest here.  I never really cared much for U2. And If that bugs you, I've got more to bug you.
I don’t necessarily disagree with your point but I would point out that other bands have continued on without their long serving drummer. The Rolling Stones come to mind right away.
Saw them in 1985...Brisbane Australia...small venue....amazing!.....They should have pulled the pin mid 1990s IMHO
It's business and diehard fans desire. Concerts of past have now become shows in Vegas. There's a group of historic bands which should have retired touring for good. Especially when vital members are no longer in the mix. Take a good look when The Eagles stated they were doing their farewell tour back in the '90s. Milked every fan with the highest concert ticket prices for that time and era. Still milked the fans on upcoming tours, even after Glenn Frey passed away in 2016. Not holding truth to their word, regarding initial farewell tour. Abet, Mötley Crüe did the same. Money Crüe. Still milking it. Fans buying it. $$$
U2 are the most over rated band of all time.
The fact some people are pissed off is just proof of how unique and amazing they are. Drummers take a beating particularly after 46 years. They want to be the first to play, and get paid for playing the Sphere. So many elements that are now standard live production U2 and Willie Williams invented. To let someone else design and perform the first shows in this new generation of performance space is a bigger loss than performing 12 shows with a sub drummer. Everyone assumes the surgery will be successful but to be honest you never know that. If you are disappointed that is fair because everyone is as well. But that doesn't mean you don't do the shows and doesn't mean they won't be great.
Here in the Netherlands we are mostly preoccupied with the fact that they chose a fairly unknown dutch drummer for his replacement...how did they go about that?
When John Bonham died in Dec 1980, Led Zep decided it was not right to continue with someone else playing drums. That decision has blessed the world with a body of work which is an enduring legacy.
I get to see Rick Beato breath Fire. Man oh man are you fired up.
It bugs me. But I’m sure the members of U2 aren’t thrilled either. They want to keep working . And things get in the way. But it’s no reason to quit. This is still the Larry Mullen Jr. Band (U2). He’ll be back (I hope).
Larry Mullen, Jr is complaining of injuries, which are probably drum related. He might not be able to play now and this may not change.
Contractual obligations anyone? Yes of course there are probably huge lumps of money involved, and at stake. From a fan’s point of view I get the rant, even though it’s a bit silly as well.  It’s business, and U2 is a mega business. Yes, Bono is Irish Jesus but U2 grew into a multi-billion dollar monster in the Nineties. LMJ no doubt would have participated if he had been able to, but the old adage ‘the show must go on’ means the show will go on without LMJ, because of monetary reasons. And addressing Dutch drummer Bart as ‘some filler drummer’ isn’t very chique from a musician’s point of view. Bart’s band Krezip skyrocketed in the Netherlands in 2000 at the age of 17 and they still chart over here. He deserves the benefit of the doubt and not to be put down by Youtube’s biggest musician’s channel, Rick.
Love U2.  Been a fan since Under a Blood Red Sky.  Don't care at all.  Good for them.  Sorry Rick.   It's not a big deal.  I'm sure Larry is OK with it.  For fans who maybe never had a chance to see them why should they stop?   They've earned the right to do whatever they want.  Sorry Rick but you're WAY wrong on this one in my opinion.  But hey...it's all a choice.  Nobody is making anyone go to see them.
It's not always as simple as not listening to it. For example, a lot of car systems are set up to start playing automatically when they connect. Since iOS doesn't let you set default apps, if you use something like Spotify, it won't play, but whatever the default iOS music app is will, and if that album is all you have, then it plays! It happens on my wife's phone all the time. We get in the car, and there is U2. She's even deleted it, and it seems to come back. I'm not sure if it is synced with iCloud or something to do with updates.
You couldn't pay me to see U2 without Larry. Period. This is a terrible idea. Just postpone until next year. Simple.
Yikes. Super cringey take…
The Beatles toured Sweden with a replacement for Ringo. When the Band backed Dylan, Levon stayed home. Granted this was early on in their careers, but Bill Wyman left the Stones decades ago and Charlie's death didn't stop them; the Who soldiers on without Entwistle and Moon. Playing music is what these people do. If they choose to continue doing it, good for them. At the same time I applaud Robert Plant's refusal to do Zep reunions and the Police's decision to pack it in (of course, they hated each other at that point).. Just fess up that you are doing it because you need to play or need the money; don't lay it off on the fans.
Rolling Stones called it quit? Deep Purple is arriving to Tokyo to play at Budokan, shall we call it quit? Judas Priest? Iron Maiden? KISS?
Larry is the drummer that convinced a 7 year old me to play the drums. I get all the logical things about why this is okay, but it feels very not okay.
Come on Rick, it's not that important, people can either pay and go and try to have a good time or they can stay at home and order some pizza and burgers or just keep their money. If the 4 of them have agreed and are OK with it, why should we be so offended by this?. I'm a huge U2 fan myself and also a fan of your videos and most of your positions and opinions, but not this time Rick.
I don't understand the objection at all. 43years on a drum throne has obviously injured the guy. He needs to maybe stop for the sake of his health. Meanwhile, the band, with Larry's blessing, want to do some gigs for their fans. Obvious solution is draft in another drummer. Larry's happy. The rest of the band are happy. The audience is happy. Where's the downside? (Edit: just checked wikipedia and the guy's been through all kinds of health issues with tendonitis, back problems etc. He's about the same age as Rick, and co-incidentally myself, so why begrudge him a time-out for his health at our age?)
The real shame here is that Wayne Newton can’t open for them 😂
Err Rick. Rolling Stones? Foo Fighters are going to tour with a new drummer. I know what you're saying however if they can sell out stadiums, go for it.
Wholeheartedly agree.
Agreed Rick. Larry Mullen Jr is too big a part of the band to replace, unless he's quit and they're broke(impossible) in which case I wouldn't judge. He's not flashy but nobody sounds like him and anyone who thinks they can is most likely sadly mistaken -despite the simplicity of his parts, his very unique feel when playing them is not to be underestimated. Given that there's no comparing the two drummers, I always respected Zep for calling it after Bonzo passed.
Bono's voice is shot also.
Liked all there stuff up til Joshua Tree. After that, they lost me.
Just a shameless money grab, as if they need it. It's like their "new" album which is just a "re-imagining" of their old songs. LOL. They were a once great band who are past their used by date. They have clearly run out of new ideas and just aren't relevant anymore.  They're tarnishing their legacy. This Las Vegas residency will be 30 minutes of songs and 2 hours of Bono virtual signaling. And what the hell is going on with Bono's hair? His hair/rug/weave needs it's own residency.
Most young U2 fans are not fans because of their recent material.  They’re fans because of albums like Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby.  I’m a 27 year old fan, and I’d love to see the ZooTV era stuff live, with Larry though
U2 without Larry Mullen Jr. is not U2. Period. So disappointing.
It's about the money honey.
I’ve been a U2 fan since they were dismissed as a “Christian band”
U2 music in the background makes me aggravated. I don't know why.
Why Rush will never play again. Geddy, Alex, Neil; the Holy Triumvirate. There's only one Rush as it should be. There should only be one U2.
With other bands, the line up can change and it is no big deal. But with U2 this is not the case. For decades it has been, 'we are the band, and we will do this until it is not fun anymore.  There for a while it was not fun and we did not do anything, then we realized we actually missed all this.  Then we rediscovered some of the old stuff. This is a song we stopped playing, for a long time. But we found it's soul again. It's Sunday Blood Sunday.'  This is paraphrased from the 11.05.2001 Austin Texas show on the Elevation tour. For decades this was a band that either did it all together or did not do it at all.
You’re dangerous cause you’re honest as U2 themselves would say it. But you’re absolutely right man.
Thumb down from me. Most fanboy rants are bs. Its about the music I like older U2 songs. Hate the new. But i never idol musisions or actors . The problem with fellow musisians who drum and are fan the might sense different style if drummer changes but problem with instrument is that talented people can imitate iconic player very well. Singers is different as voice is more uniek and level difficult to imitate . But core of U2 sound for non musisans is voice of bono and massive guitar effect guru the edge. . Its dutch Krezip drummer and other band drummer comment ot might not differ that much bit could. Aparently the show must go on. Replacing bono or the edge might very big change on the music it self. Drummer and base not that much.
Love it. Rick is keeping it real per usual. U2 need to hang it up or … dare i say just pull their collective heads out of their A**’s lol
U2 sold out to DAVOS and the United Nations a long time ago.
Te amo Rick, ojalá se den cuenta los viejos que le están pidiendo con estas decisiones
I don't want to hate on my favorite band of all time. But this is just weird on so many levels.   Manila was one of the last shows in their tour in December 2019. It was an amazing experience. But as a fan for nearly 30 years, it felt like they were effectively a legacy act at that point, without a legitimate hit since Vertigo. I think this pretty much seals the deal.
Larry has been suffering with low back pain for many years. He had to have extensive lumbar surgery. Sitting for the amount of time required to do a residency would not be advisable in order to insure a successful recovery for Larry. I think it’s a shame that they are not waiting for him to recover before doing these shows.
U2 playing without Larry Mullen Jr. because he has health issues? That would be like Rush finding a replacement for Neil Peart in the late 90s.
The replacement drummer became famous playing in Dutch teenage pop rock band Krezip, which produced some absolute mediocre and irrelevant music. Unbelievable that U2 swaps Larry for this nitwit.
I blame The Wiggles for starting all this.
I can’t agree, in my soul. Larry is the scaffolding and REASON u2 persevere, was formed
I think this video was clickbait
Simple fix, just bill it as Bono, The Edge, and Adam. It ain't U2 without the 4 of them... the fans would still go if they want to see those 3 guys. Bono had no trouble selling out his book tour shows. Also, Larry always said he would stop being interested if they were only going out to play the old hits. No new originals record in 5 years. I know he has some physical issues being the masher that he is and I'm sure that's the real issue, but that old quote crossed my mind when I saw this news.
Why didn't they do this when Paul smashed his face in a bicycle accident? They could have replaced him with anybody? LOL One of the biggest reasons so many LOVE U2, is because they always have been the same guys. From beginning,,, To End.. WTF is this demon putting in their heads now?
The Rolling Stones?
U2 have been irrelevant for 23/24 years, and that's being generous...
Love U2. HATED having that album forced on us!  One of their worst albums too.  It was like catching a virus!  I still can’t delete those songs!  Rick is right, another bad idea.
Honestly for me, the last U2 album I ever gave attention was Achtung Baby. After that, things went south for their records. And absent U2 member JUST WON'T CUT IT! They have been together for 47 years and this is the first time one of the members will be absent in one of their major gigs. Nope, no dice on me!
im 53 following them since day 1 if Larry cant play then dont do the tour
U2?... worst things have happened
I love U2 and have been a fan ever since I was 8 years old over three decades ago. When Guy O’Seary took over for Paul McGuinness when he retired, I knew something was amiss. They started working with producers and songwriters that couldn’t hold a candle to what U2 accomplished with Lillywhite, Eno , Lanois, and Flood. (Yes, I’m referring to Ryan Tedder, who’s mediocrity is all over both Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience). When they made the Pop album in 1996-97, McGuinness famously said that it was a case of “Too many cooks in the kitchen” as to why the album sounded like an unfinished work (75% of that album is some of their strongest material ever). We see them repeating the same mistake now, except Pop had Flood, Nellee Hooper, Steve Osborne, Marius Devries, Ben Hillier, Spike Stent, Howie B and Alan Moulder. Sorry, but Ryan Tedder, Paul Epworth, and Andy Barlow aren’t even qualified to be in the same room as any of the guys who worked on Pop. Danger Mouse, maybe. And those are the people who are shaping the direction of U2’s new music. Rant over.
You’re Badass Beato!  I was an early 80’s U2 fan  Achtung Baby was a disappointment in my opinion   That bass players big dick was disturbing to see  No wonder he got with that black fox
As a lifelong U2 fan I really think their time's up, essentially they are a spent force musically. Why would anyone pay good money to see a bunch of borderline granddads 'rock out' to an album they made back in '91?
I'm sure they'll be alright.
well they can end up like that one south park were rod Stewart goes out in a wheel chair and tells everyone that he pooped himself ! and the crowd cheered  on !
Wd love to see U2s comment on this... I guess Larry supported and maby even encouraged 'em to do it. Sometimes steping aside it's the best way to let things flow...  Now, let's see how many fans actually attend to this show acknowledged
Don't mince words Rick. What do you really thing? ;)
This is your worst video.
I'm a big fan of Rattle and Hum. Love it!
U2 sucks, always have ,always will. Bono is a tool!!
It's still about the ALMIGHTY BUCK.  Sad.  Nobody sounds like Larry Mullen Jr.
he's old man. give him a break
I think that Larry Mullen have earn the title of senior now.
One other comment, rant if you like.  These guys are filthy rich.  Do they really need the cash so badly to a) sell themselves down the drain with a fucking Vegas residency and b) do it without their drummer and founder?
I am glad they are in residence in Vegas.  Long career they deserve it.  And as a fan, I'd rather see them there than slep to my local 80,000 stadium or crappy Fenway Park and watch a big TV for an expensive night of hassles.  Fans will get better seats and see a better show.  Who says rock stars have to constantly be on the road suffering.  I'm sure this isnt forever.
Why they didn’t get Lars is beyond me…
Klaus Schwab is the new drummer.
My all time favorite band. Converted on the War tour. I can understand their wanting to play and be the first in the venue but stand with Larry dammit. It’s all or nothing. There’s no other band like them and they shouldn’t start compromising now. And they should also all get back into the band room together and start writing as a unit again. That’s where the magic is!
At least they hired a live drummer, not a synth track
THEY'VE LOST IT since mid 2000s.    Bono hanging out with the most venal, humanity-hating people in the world.    Tepid, vanilla last two albums.
Love ya, Rick! Happy V-Day!
Ok I've never missed a U2 show in Sydney Australia. Been a fan since I Will Follow. Now imagine my surprise when they play the 1st night of their ZooTv Zooropa tour in 1993 without Adam Clayton on bass, but his bass tech playing. Did it look weird? Absolutely, was I annoyed that no announcement was made before the show? I was 2 songs in before I noticed so yes I was pissed off a bit, but did it effect their show? Not really. Did I miss Adam? Absolutely, but then again I have had a new experience of seeing a temporary line up change because Adam was sick. Was I pissed off with Adam when I found out it was because he was so drunk he couldn't stand, I was so pissed off with him & for all the band. When I found out why he'd gotten so drunk because of a break up with his then girlfriend. Well I've been there before so I got over it. Same here perhaps they are contractually obligated to play the show? Possibly delayed by the pandemic? We don't know? If it because of injury, we'll they're not getting any younger are they? At least they are making it clear this time there will be a substitute sitting in with the band. As for the FREE album, ok slight misstep there, but what do you ever get for free these days? I purchased the CD anyway, because that's what fans do.
Also the have been reworking songs why ? It’s not like they need the money, what is their end goal for doing this ?
Um, Queen?
Could not agree more – what are they thinking? Maybe they’re following  Disneys “we don’t give a s--- about the fans” strategy. Disturbing even though not a huge U2 fan - saw them at Toads in 1980, War tour,  and 2 of the 3 Hartford Joshua Tree shows.
The band hasn't made a decent album since How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb.  Then, they began recycling their material, first on the road and now in the studio and with this Vegas residency.  Beato's rant about Larry is beside the point -- the band stopped growing long ago and is in a creative tailspin.  That's fine -- they've made some great statements along the way and can afford to coast now.  There's little point in flogging them into doing something new if they aren't feelin' it.  Larry isn't being "replaced", only temporarily filled in for while he's on the mend.  Big difference.  Stow it, Rick.  You've got bigger fish to fry than this old mackerel.
My favorite U2 shows were  Unforgettable Fire Tour at the Brendan Byrne Arena in NJ and  Amnesty International Show at Giants Stadium. U2 played second to last right played before The Police in one of their final shows of the 20th Century. That was a show with 2 Headliners! GREAT! I wont go to the Vegas Gig unless I somehow win tickets! Get Well soon Larry!
I agree U2 had their run.  Time to move on.
..... likely more to do with the construction delays of the $2+ BILLION MSG Sphere which began in 2018, but stopped due to Covid-related supply chain problems. It was supposed to open in 2021. U2 might have been the originally planned residency act to kick off this new concert venue 2 years ago.....or maybe James Dollan of MSG offered them so much money they couldn't say no. U2's Crew have been out of work for 2+ years.
Bono surrounds himself with only "yes" people, it was his idea and the previous manager's to release Songs of Innocence for free on Itunes, something that the band has never recovered. And now these: that awful lame ass record that should have been Bono's and this Vegas tenure without Larry. They're making it seem like they need the money, but they don't.
This band is self imploding.  This hideous Vegas residency plus the horrendous soon to be released Songs of Surrender ( a blatant cash grab of reimagined versions of once classic songs)
I totally agree. I have seen every tour since 1982 but I’m skipping this one. I’m not happy.
Amen and amen
I saw them on The Unforgettable Fire tour, and remember the entire crowd singing the line in "40" for like 10 minute AFTER the concert was over.  I stood in line to buy Joshua Tree and expected Achtung Baby to be the same awesome as the previous 6 albums I had from them.  I thought it was awful. Fortunately, I had found Alice In Chains and other grunge bands, and moved on from U2. Everything I heard after that, which was not much, just did not really hit me. I think it is great that people still like them, but yeah, playing without their drummer is not really in line with "fan friendly". Sounds like their new manager just wants to get paid while they are still able to play.
They are a good group
LOL at the poor, nameless "fill-in drummer." Also the 33-year-old fan described as a "kid." 😄
I saw U2 during the Achtung Baby tour.  September of 1992 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.  Definitely an *amazing* concert!
Easy there, brother Rick.... I think you're getting yourself fired up about a tempest in a teapot! I'm going to take the opposing view. The commercial aside, I think we're so starved for real musicians that we should encourage these veteran bands to keep going. Hell, I saw ELO 3 years ago and they blew the doors off! With all the low-grade lyrics & auto tune dominating today's music scene, U2 back on stage  is good news. Larry Mullen needs to have back surgery and that could take time to heal. If he's good w/ the band doing a LV residency, who are we to criticize?
Only saw U2 once - around 1980 - at the Agora Ballroom in Atlanta. This was their first American tour. They didn't have enough songs to do a different one, so (as I recall), they repeated a song for their encore. I doubt there were more than 300 people there, as no one knew much about them. "Boy" had just been released. Went to buy tickets early afternoon and Bono was by the bar, with no one around him. I saw the B-52s there about the same time (best concert I ever saw!).
I can live without or without U2
Being a drummer myself, I'm constantly trying to make myself less expendable by learning more instruments, singing in some songs, and writing songs. Drumming is my favorite thing to do, but we are so easily replaced with another drummer or just drum machines. Super good to hear you stick up for him as he IS an integral part of U2's sound
Achtung is my favorite album of theirs, I remember breaking down in the desert with a mate and I had this in my Walkman on cassette tape, I lost count of how many times I flipped that cassette walking out to get help it definitely kept me moving forward, such a trip! To be honest I think I may also have been tripping for real! Just saying!
Vegas residencies are for crooners and magicians who can't fill venues around the country (or world) so get their hard-core fans, and bored Vegas tourists looking for something to do, to come and fill a venue in Vegas. A Vegas residency is not for any rock band with any credibility and U2 has got plenty of that, so what they heck are they thinking? If Bono thinks they'll be performing for their fans, he's dead wrong. Most of their fans will not be able to afford to fly to Vegas, spend a couple of nights in a hotel and pay for all the incidentals along the way. Strange how these really famous rockers like Springsteen, Eagles, U2 and many others, lose touch with reality and can no longer relate to the fans who made it all possible for them?
Money. Cold hard cash. Green folding paper. It's that simple. They're a business and they are probably running a little low, relative to the lifestyle they are accustomed to. Time to pretend to miss the fans. 🤣🤣🤣 That's the funniest part of it all. "We miss you guys!" Yeah, they miss making millions and millions off of them.
What's funny to me, on this too is, U2 HATED LV when they paled there, 3rd or 4th date or their Joshoa Tree tour, back in the mid-80's!  I was at that show!  They filmed the video, "I still haven't found what I'm looking for" video to PROTEST the CORRUPTION of LV!  TRUE! b TRUE!
Untrue.  An example: Chicago replaced (fired) their drummer (Dan Seraphine), after 30 years - despite being one of the 3 founders (of the original 7 - incidentally none with the band now). Seraphine defined a new type of rock-n-roll drumming, as a lead voice, bombastic fills and all. So identifiable as the original '70s sound. Subsequent drummers were very good, even great - but the sound was different.  Nobody cared.  Fans went and didn't even know the difference, or cared quite frankly (they still go).  The manager knows that - $$$$$!.
No Larry = No U2. Period. Wait for your mate or don't play at all!
Seems like a "the show must go on" decision more than anything. Now if they kicked him out the band because of his back issues then I could understand your anger Rick.
Um, they couldn't wait until Larry recovers from his surgery? WTAF Seems very fishy.
So what should they do if Mullen can't play? Give up playing music? Binge watch lots and lots of TV shows?
It's totally understandable ... he's a drummer. Look at Phil Collins ... his back injury really messed him up, to the point where he has challenges singing now. Drumming is really hard on the back, and anyone hitting 60 is going to have issues playing, let alone someone who plans to play night after night. I understand this decision, the other members still want to play live, and Larry Mullin, Jr. just can't do it without constant pain. The only thing I can think he might try is to do what Phil used to do in his 50s...get a second drummer to help out and just play fills.
Rick! I was supposed to be at that same U2 show with Pearl Jam in Hawaii with my best friend Mike. But at the last moment my boss yanked the permission for time off. 🤦🏻‍♂️
The highlight for me was Joshua tree and rattle and hum, after that, it took me a minute to dig some of their songs. With or without u, their best song, new year 's day was the first one I heard and liked it immediately
I've been a fan of U2 since the first album, but it actually took me a few decades to realize the heart and soul of U2 music, the real magic of the band has always been that rhythm section. Adam Clayton & Larry Mullen Jr., no one has done it better.
Bono, the Edge and Adam Clayton will be joined by drummer Bram van den Berg, who will be sitting at the kit instead of founding member Larry Mullen Jr. as the latter takes “time out to undergo and recuperate from surgery in 2023,” the band said in a statement.  “It’s going to take all we’ve got to approach the Sphere without our bandmate in the drum seat, but Larry has joined us in welcoming Bram van den Berg who is a force in his own right,” Bono, the Edge and Clayton said.  My guess is they had already signed the contracts and have to honor the dates and or they are itching to play and he will be welcomed back with open arms. I dunno, just a guess like everyone else.
Won’t be the first here to point out the Stones, eh? When does a band stop being the band they were? Anyhow, us drummers and bass players, we are the replaceable back seaters 😕
A little harsh Rick ... a band that his been together for 43 years is virtually unheard of.  Musicians lose interest, change focus, go in different directions... and unfortunately get sick, and die.  Larry's body is apparently showing it's age from smashing skins for 50 years.  Name another band with the same longevity. The Stones ... well Watts is dead and they haven't hung it up.  Elton John ... I think it is his last go round but he is an act not an band.  The Eagles ... still touring.  U2 is at the end of their career.  I don't get the slamming of a band you are supposedly a huge fan of.  Is your view ship down?  ... do better.
In my my opinion Bono and the Edge are U2 and I would love to see them in Las Vegas. Because their drummer has medical issues- should they give up what they Love? Go on a rant about Journey replacing Steve Perry.  I'm Not sure what you are whining about but it would be a cold existance without your channel.
It’s U1.5 in LV
I suppose we won’t be seeing a U2 interview then, Rick?  I think you might have just sunk that battleship. 😂
People are kind of deaf these days..  They can go with a drum loop and people surely can dig it.  Anyway... Maybe they need the money, and getting old still sucks.
Great rant Rick!
Although I agree with Rick, I'll be shocked if the shows don't sell out. People who were fans 30+ years ago when the album came out, might not be likely to see a show in Vegas today; for various reasons. I've been surprised how much the younger generations listen to older music. Maybe cause in the past 20 years, not much original music has come out. Rock was evolving every decade from the 50's on and I don't know why after Linkin Park, it kind of stopped.
I’m a big fan. Seen the band live a dozen times. I last saw them here in NZ in December 2019. It feels odd this move. As for being a fan of Achtung Baby. You have to have felt the energy of that album when it came out. The dissonance of it and raw emotion of the tours that followed it. Larry is the engine in that band. I hope he gets back if their residency is extended. To play as many tours and shows at the level he has had to contribute at it’s no wonder he has had injuries. Watch him on Rattle And Hum and you can see there are some hard miles on the clock with his heavy hitting ✊Love him and the band. Hard to think of any other drummers who have had to do what he has for so long.
Two groups that I thought would call it quits after a member's passing was Steely Dan (Fagen and Becker) and ZZ Top. When Becker passed, I was sure that Fagen would call it quits. Nope. When Dusty Hill passed, I was very surprised that they kept touring without him...like right away after his passing. Not passing judgements because they can do what they like but I think the days of "I'm not continuing without you" are gone.
In 20 years the band can nap up on stage in reclining chairs while a cover band plays and the audience will pay 4 digit ticket prices just as long as Bono burps into the microphone every now and then.
Money grabbing is really sad to see as a music fan. The "Pantera" reunion. Journey and their money driven implosion. Blink reunion and their $600 tickets. The greed is out of control!
I’m sorry Rick, but I can’t let this BS about SoI auto downloading and calling it their mistake.  Fact: I’m a huge U2 fan. Fact: I had an iPhone Fact: it never downloaded to my phone.  Why? Because I didn’t set my phone up to do auto download everything. It was (and is) a manual process. Thus, Superfan never got his copy of the album from Apple. I bought the CD and ripped it to flac then converted it to MP3.
Having watched "Elivs". I wonder if their manager is allowed to leave the US. Is it cheaper for this 40+ year old band to take a residency in Las Vetgas or are they just too old (in their 60's) to tour?
People are so fucking selfish about having the band in a way they romatisise it in their head, I know there's nothing better than original members, the poor guy is ill. I think it's great they're going ahead with the gigs, enormous amounts of otganisation go into these things, can't just drop it all cause people 'want' original members only.
The drummers always fall off…Peart, Bonham, Hawkins, Ward, Moon. That’s why Carey doing what he’s doing is stunning.
U² are working for the Ukrainian laundromat now!
Rick no offense but I think your missing the point entirely. U2 is not Larry Mullen jr. U2 are a collective of people who want to go out and play a few shows to fans that would enjoy this experience. This is not a tour. Having a member miss out on shows is nothing new to the music world it happens often where bands have carried on, it's even happened to my band. U2 wants to present this awesome album in a new/ modern show to fans who love the album.  Will Larry be missed? Yes I'm sure but the whole reason U2 is doing this is simple...because they can. I love ya Rick but no offense your rant didn't hold any merit.
I stopped listening to U2 when they became globalist puppets
The Beatles played a few live dates with a substitute drummer when Ringo was ill.  This is hard for some musicians to accept, but most non-musicians don't care who the drummer is.  Or any the other musicians, either.  Which is why so many singers in a band leave the band for solo careers... when it dawns on them that most non-musicians don't care who the other other band members are, so why split the take when one can hire musicians and pay them a salary?  Which is not to say that all singers who leave their band for a solo career make it, but probably more do than don't.  So, sorry, Rick, and yes, a "substitute drummer" may very well be insufficiently creative to come up with unique drum grooves on new songs.  But I"m sure the substitute drummer will be able to play all of Mullen's drum grooves on their existing songs just as well or at least well enough that no one will care.  Just as the Rolling Stones are really Mick and Keith, U2 is really Bono and the Edge.  I remember, in U2's early days, a running joke in NME or some British music paper, where various of the writers would ask, "What does Adam Clayton do?"  Mullen is a creative drummer, but Clayton is your average cookie cutter bassist, could be replace with any competent bassist in a heartbeat.
The Edge needs to stop wearing his stupid knit cap.
Larry's just following the shrewd example of Bono's voice - which also hasn't been with the band since around 2003.   (time to hang it up guys)
Maybe Larry has finally had a gutful of Bono lol
maybe they spent all their money 🤣🤣.. probably not.. another bonehead new manager decision. maybe the band has to play in front of  a audience so bad, they're listening to bad decisions.. 🤣🤣. is that like ,Grand funk railroad without Mark Farner 🤣🤣
Should have tapped Phil Collins for a real douche fest.
Yeah, this has "money grab" written all over it.
U2 is finished. Last good album they released was Pop in 1997. I was fan back then. Now i completely doesnt care about u2
I know it pays the bills, but this is a truly weak rant. A terrible take, poorly delivered.
If I'm remembering right, there was one person who was against the Apple deal. Larry Mullen Jr
U2’s last great album was Achtung, which is over 30 years ago. After that, Bono became too full of himself and also became an NWO stooge (who recalls the triangle photo?). Now, as Rick suggests, they are just trying to rake in the money while they still can. Without Mullin, this is nit U2.
Who knows.  I am a big LMJ influenced drummer and major WAR and Unforgettable Fire fan, and had honeymoon tickets to see them in ‘97 but it didn’t work out.  Had a great honeymoon anyway.  Maybe I will take her to see most of the band for our 26th.  If nothing else, get to see a great visual show and hear one of my favorite guitar players.
Yeah, I’m more concerned about the Songs of Surrender album approaching. Redoing old classics? That RARELY works out. Might be jumping the shark more than they did with the Apple iTunes debacle!😢
Not to sound cynical, but this is all about $$$, not so much about missing people's faces.  Above all, I hope Larry Mullen Jr.'s health is okay--wishing him the best.
Without Larry, U2 is not U2.  I get their contractual obligations to play the MSG Sphere shows but to do so without one of the original band members does not sit well with me at all.  U2 seem to have lost that creative edge (no pun intended) which once made them the biggest band in the world and they now seem to be searching for things that should have no interest for a band of their stature.  The answer is simple… get all of the band together in a room, dream it all up again and put out some new records of songs which they actually want to make instead of rehashing their old tracks and doing a glitzy Vegas residency without the man which started the band!  Rant over!
Amen Rick.
Been a fan since '81 .. the Four is it or nothing for me. Kinda like Bill Berry and R.E.M. it's just ... different.
I don’t care what ANYONE says… U2 without LMJr. is NOT U2. Period.
Sad!
Not a fan. Sorry.
U2 was my first concert in 1986...
Amen Rick. U2 was my first big influence as a kid and Achtung Baby is my favourite album. I was in grade 10 when it was released and it changed everything (along with Grunge admittedly). That album was was my guide to darker, awsome music, especially learning about Bowie's Berlin period.  Like their contemporaries RHCP, it's obvious that it's time to move on. "You glorify the past when the future dries up."
U2 played several shows in the early 90s without Adam Clayton while he was sobering up.
A Vegas residency seems like something they should have done during the Pop era-to be ironic. This  reeks of a long in the tooth nostalgia band realizing how expensive it is to tour post-covid trying to cash in and save money.  I think Sting summed it up perfectly in his interview with RIck...a band is a gang but you can't stay in a gang all your life, you have to move on or you end up repeating yourself.
I’m glad no one told Led Zeppelin this when they decided to play the O2 with Jason Bonham
I totally agree - wait till it’s the entire band. I hate money grabs. Sadness….
I am going to make unpopular opinion statements. I haven't cared about U2's music after Achtung Baby. I have felt that after that period, they've become far too commercial. If they want to do a residency in Vegas, it is their right to do so. However, they need to be more transparent as to why Larry Mullen Jr. isn't going to participate. For me, the whole thing comes across as a big money grab.
U3
And one other thing songs of surrender the new versions of these songs is to me, a mess I love the old versions I don’t need new versions that actually sounds kind of worse than the old ones and the old ones are epically great and perfect so sorry you u2. On the other hand, my nephew who is 14 years old absolutely loves them and I hope he gets to see them someday whether it’s Vegas or somewhere else so they are still turning out fans and it’s incredible so God bless
I saw U2 at Oakland Stadium with the Sugarcubes opening! 👏
I agree.
Couldn’t agree more. I’m 53. Saw them in Philly in 1984 on the unforgettable fire tour saw them at the Meadowlands and 87 and I saw them at the show you referenced at that stadium at the zoo TV tour. I just find it incredible that they can’t see past the idea of simply making a ton of money. tickets that you know are going to start at $500 and go up from there and I ask myself when you add in a flight and a hotel that you’re gonna be paying three or $4000 a person to see this show just not worth it and I’m good with u2 in my memory and on record don’t need to see them again.
$$$
What, the Stones should've stopped because Charlie died?  Yeah, If Paul and Ringo ever toured together...who would come?  YOU.  ARE.  WRONG.
It'd be like if Tool went on tour without Danny Carey.
U2 is so old does anyone care at all? I would rather see an LED hologram U2 show at the Sphere.
Theres a list of veteran big bands as long as my arm that do this, slight over reaction. Im sure he will be back when his backs mended. The tackier thing is that theyre doing vegas!
It's not OK to retire from that mess? If I had to keep listening to the Edge play the SAME lousy crap over and over, I'd retire too.
U2 playing a Vegas residency? . . . Next thing you know they’ll be selling off their catalog for a bazillion dollars.  But hey, they earned it.
That band, as great as they are, lost me after Achtung Baby. Imo, they became the band they once railed against...style over substance the last 30 years.
101% agree!!!
definitely think that at the very least they play songs from all the albums.. or just go on tour everywhere..
Rick is a purist and that is why we love him
It's a money-making machine, contracts ought to be complied with. Did the Stones stop touring when Watts died? Exactly! ;) Now, they even have more hype and coverage because of this news. People will rush to their gigs just the same.
Bands are a cup of coffee...............one member is hot water, one is coffee grounds, one is sugar, and one is cream. Together it is heaven in the mouth........individually it is  the pleasure equivalent of eating a band aid (used or new).....I think this is true of most bands-police-the beatles-pink floyd. I was a huge fan of the band until Joshua tree. Achtung baby for me was  really where the band went from being an influence for young musicians, to themselves being influenced-the Manchester scene fully infiltrated their sound ; inspiral carpets, charlatans UK, stone roses etc. Granted, it is a tough thing to be at the top of innovation and expect to stay there
Never cared that much for their music.
Maybe they need the money?
I have every confidence in the tour drummer they selected. Journey did it with Steve Perry, and that was a frontman. The show goes on...
U2 is now more like Big Pharma, NATO and MIC just want to squeeze everyone’s last dollar.
Larry has back problems. Probably doubtful he will play again on tour. Sad he won’t be playing but other bands play on (e.g Mick Mars not playing in Mötley Crüe )  If it’s the only way then so be it.   Also Achtung Baby IS U2 best album
This was clickbait and not well thought out
As long as the new drummer doesn't play on a new album, no one has been replaced
Anyone who believes the band’s manager is calling the shots is delusional. The band has been one of the biggest on the planet since 1988…no one tells them to do anything that they don’t want to do.
I have NOT been a fan for over 40 years...
Big U2 fan. Seen them 6 times in New Zealand.  Love them and would love to see them with Larry again, but if it means the have to tour with another drummer so people can see them again, so be it. I'm in.
I agree, at least it’s not as bad as Genesis in terms of replacing band members
It was mentioned around the time of the Kennedy Center that if U2 went on tour it would be without Larry because he needed surgery. I know it seems strange for them to tour without Larry. Odder still is the new album of remixes coming out in March.
If I heard Rick correctly (perhaps I didn't)...Rock bands have expiration dates. Sometimes they are the last ones to know when that is.
I would love to see U2 in Vegas but not without Larry Mullen, this band has been in a slow fizzle these past years but now they are clearly crumbling.
Rick:  How do you feel about the Rolling Stones' lineup?
That band has lost the plot. eek
Residency is basically retirement home 😅
“Yes, some bands replace people and go on.” Absolutely. I love Yes.
I get why Larry can’t play, but U2 without all four guys is just U1½.
Just more GREED.....go away you’ve made enough money
i know you upset but they need money to keep on. and larry somehow will understand that( or maybe not) . so we better hear from the men itself. that will be clear all the problem.
a lot of drummers have been sick and dying these past few years  .....hop LMJ is ok
Ahh yes, now you are finally sounding like me. With age Mr Beato, comes wisdom..
I figure they can do what they want. Nobody is forced to attend.
I would offer my drumming services to U2 but playing onstage with them doing that album is scary!!😬😅seriously I would do it in a heartbeat!
I was never a U2 fan. So, either they're here or close up shop. No problem for me. They're not my cup of tea.
You are 100% correct, sir! Larry is so key to their sound, and Achtung Baby, it's absurd that they'd do this and for such a lame excuse. I hope Larry is ok and bounces back from whatever back issues he has.
I agree, this just seems unnecessary. Honestly I think Larry is tired of the whole thing and wants off the treadmill.
Saw U2 in South Korea December 2019-Seoul
Proof they're just in it for the money and don't give a flip. I can't find the article, but Bono said to some kind of music mag in like the 80s, maybe early 90s, that he's just in it for the money. That's a paraphrase but essentially how I remember it. I've never liked them. Sorry. I know they're iconic, but they're posers IMO.
ALL newbies that love U2 going back 15-20 years probably dont care who the drummer is or really dont know who the EDGE is, they just dont care
Bono has appeared on stage with the leaders of the World Economic Forum, all holding hands together raised in the air in a self-congratulatory victory salute.  He is supporting this evil institution that is pushing the ideas that "you'll own nothing and be happy', you will eat plant-based protein and crickets instead of meat and be happy, and of course all digital currency that you can lose your access to if you aren't acting like a good little slave.  Either he's been threatened or blackmailed, or he's basically sold his soul to the devil.  I refuse to listen to this music anymore or support them in any way.  I liked their original material but then it got boring, and their Zoo TV tour was a huge turnoff.
Amen Rick. This no Larry is as bizarre of an idea as it is dumb.
Its a lotta pounds and the tax rate is much higher  in the  Emerald Isle.
Between this and how Aerosmith did Joey Kramer recently it’s so frustrating to hear about this news. I’d love to go see U2 but I’m  a drummer, and that includes Larry Mullen Jr.
I don't even like U2 but I can still see that this is a bad idea.
The Ship of Theseus approach kills me, when bands continue with multiple new members. Most of the time, Foreigner plays with no original members as Mick Jones only hits the stage as his health allows. Styx essentially has one original member, two if you count Tommy (important but not original) and who knows how much longer JY will stick it out. Blackfoot has had two all-new lineups in the past five years. Blood Sweat, and Tears... Quiet Riot... Thin Lizzy... Iron Butterfly... all without any original members.
Poor fill-in Drummer, a huge fan of Rick's  ...clicks on Rick's new upload...and...
Solid point, no U2 member is replaceable, who could "fill in" for The Edge? But Rick, I do feel you are being a bit harsh... When Bono was hurt in the bike accident, the band still played live without him. Chris Martin and Bruce Springsteen came and sang for him, and they were great! This is a huge opportunity for the band, and also for Achtung Baby to get some really well deserved attention and recognition! Larry, (along with the rest of the band) was a big part of that record, and it is such an awesome album!! U2 can honour Larry's work, and let it shine! If only I could go see these shows! It's so cruel...
Pity Bono turned into a hypocritical, one world government WEF shill. U2 died years ago.
Can't say I'm even remotely bothered that U2 might play without Larry Mullen Jr. The stand-in will be a brilliant player, and they will sound and look great.  I have seen Simple Minds live four times - with three different drummers - and they were fantastic every time. I hope the folk that go to see U2 have a fabulous time.
What a weird take!?! So if a band member has health issues and is unavailable to play for a while, the rest of the band has to sit out and fans can’t enjoy their shows? If a quarterback is injured, we stop the games?!? Come on Rick.
They played one gig in Sydney from memory without Adam Clayton, who was hung over....I think that is the only other gig without the 4
The stones don't like this video.
My guess is Mullen is not interested.
Sensei Beato has spoken!! totally agree
C’mon Rick! It’s all about the coin. But, I’d go, lol
Agreed - total cash grab and misstep
For the first time I wish Dave Grohl would pull a Zelig on this.
This does have the vibe of disappointment. U2 is the four members.
they probably need the money. the agent is ripping them off. they do not need an agent to get a residency in vegas. they do not care. people with that much money live in another world. the fans will pay through the nose and they will gladly take the money. i heard they are not even performing. they are using the new tesla robots dress as them.
I quit going to Beatles performances after they fired Pete Best. Sometimes you gotta stick it to their pocketbooks to get your point across.
They should have gone out like REM.
A fan here. But a -residency at Caesar’s in Vegas ? U2 ??    Maybe Bono needs to preach a message to his people .  Not sure
That would be if Rush went on without Neil ..
Been a U2 fan since I was 12, 41 years ago. I don’t think this is a good move.  Their rhythm section is their secret weapon.  With so much money, why do this? The Stones get a pass as Watts died but outside of that, 👎🏻👎🏻
So much for that interview with The Edge.
Wow, selfish (and pointless) rant ?  Poor Larry is what I was thinking.
Led Zeppelin didn't find a "replacement". You're right, when is enough enough? I've been a fan since Boy in 1980 and I'm not going.
Bow
Now out gracefully... Spellchecker gets it wrong sometimes
U2 is the Tom Brady of the music world... Just go away. You were great, awesome and loved...just go away...don't be Kiss, THE Rolling stones or the other bands that have just lingrred...and lingered...and lingered. Mick Jagged needs to go away...Gene Simmons needs to go away...Tom Brady needs to go away ...and Yes,  U2 needs to go away... With fond memories of what they accomplished...of the impact they made...but enough is enough... Please know how to now our gracefully
Doing it without Larry is one thing but thinking that you’re being true to your fans by playing a residency in Vegas is just bullshit. Touring is how you give your fans the chance to see you play live, you take the show on the road. I’m gonna stop now before I get carried away. Vegas, give me a break!
I would not be surprised if Larry isn’t replaced by a hologram Larry. I’m a big U2 fan from around 1983. I saw them once, the final Achtung Baby performance at Anaheim, CA stadium in 1993. It lasted over 3 hours and we only sat down for one song. This was the pinnacle of the band’s musical performance abilities. Soon afterward, their front man went on a self-serving power trip that continues today. Their later music does not transcend. It is instead very commercialized. I removed their forced download album simply because it sucked. I live in Las Vegas and doubt I’ll go to their show. I believe it will be more of a recorded light and sound show than live performance.
Dude, chill, you're overreacting...
Dude needs surgery, will be out of action during a long convalescence and the show must go on. Bands replace members permanently or temporarily all the time, and mostly don't miss a beat. What's the big deal?
I’ve been a fan since 1980 and have seen them live 8 times in multiple N. American cities. I was so excited when I heard they were doing a LAS residency, but I didn’t know LMJr wouldn’t be playing. I wish they would have given him a chance to recover and then schedule the residency WITH him. Bummer.
“Songs of Innocence“ automatically plays on my phone whenever I connect to Bluetooth. I HATE IT! (and I generally love U2)
And by the way, The Police broke up because they couldn’t stand each other.   The Beatles broke up because they wanted to.   LOL.  U2 are still together because they like each other.
Wow! Spot on Rick! As someone your age who has seen the band seven times and considers Achtung Baby to be one of the greatest albums of all-time, I was initially very excited to hear the news of their residency in Vegas…and then…I found out that Larry will not be behind the kit for the shows. I actually started laughing at how stupid this idea is; like the Beatles without Ringo. Suffice to say I won’t be going to the show; not without their ‘original’ drummer in the lineup.
This is a symptom of Front Man Syndrome....people thinking Bono (& perhaps The Edge) are the only important part of the band.  Which tells me either the management know nothing about music, or that Bono's insane ego came into play, or both.  Don't underestimate the singer rating themselves higher than the drummer. Robert Plant used to put down John Bonham all the time.
Arguably, each album alone: Boy (1980), October (1981), War (1983), Under A Blood Red Sky (1983), Unforgettable Fire (1984), Wide Awake in America (1985), The Joshua Tree (1987), could be the definition of "MASTERPIECE." And what is truly astonishing is that those were consecutive album releases. Everything U2 had ever recorded up to that point in time was like that. Genius. Then came Rattle and Hum (1988), and it was welcomed, and it had its own league. Then came Achtung Baby (1991), and after The Fly it was hard to get to the end of the record just to listen to Love is Blindness and think that it had been worth the wait. Achtung Baby was produced by Steve Lillywhite, Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno. Those names solely should have gathered legions of U2 fans around Achtung Baby, back in 1991. So, I have 7 + 2 U2 albums, and that is it. I am happy they found new listeners.
When any member of U2 cannot play in the band, U2 is done.
Everything has its time...everything dies... I should know...I am the lord of time.
Come on Rick.   Relax dude.  U2 miss playing live.  The fans miss them playing live.   Larry gave them his blessing to do these shows.  Sheesh.     Quit blabbering.   It’s only rock and roll but we love it.    Achtung Baby, yah!!  Quit bashing U2 man.   They’re not replacing Larry.   I thought you were more intelligent Beato.   Think I’ll go watch Zoo TV.
I have been a long time fan since 1981 and this band seems lost and just about money now.  I am really saddened by this.  It seems to be a blatant money grab. SOS seems really ill-conceived to as well.  They should fire their manager.  Or they are completely out of new ideas and can’t come to terms with making music for themselves and for their art even though it may not be huge hits or all that relevant anymore.  So they are stuck in the past and now abandoning the band for a chance to be relevant and open a new arena.  I Hope I am wrong, but it seems that ego is off the hook here.  I thought SOE could have been a great record if they cut a few songs.  Hopefully they will prove me wrong and put out a great record after this and tour with Larry in 2024 or 2025.  But it seems they are out of ideas and trying to cash in.  Which I guess they have every right to do so, but it would be better to just end it.  End the ego and expectations on the band and start over smaller and better, eventually maybe tour as a band again.  I heard  My Blue Room today, and it struck me how easy and beautiful that song feels, which is unlike the forced feeling of the last 2 records.  It seems any vestige of artistic integrity is fading.
If they're going to do something like this, Mullen should be part of the messaging. Having his face out there and hearing how proud he is for the band to continue would be a great thing to have in press releases and adverts. It would have taken very little to shoot a promo with all of them talking about the band, what they've been through, and how important it is for fans to hear live U2.   Even a short, "I wish I could be there" clip from Mullen would lean into some goodwill and respect towards fans.
Look, there's rants ... and then there's whiny rants. To be fair, I thought Crowded House could not bring it after the loss of their amazing drummer Paul Hester. But they did. Achtung Baby was the peak of U2 (along with Joshua Tree and **maaaaybe** ZooTV). If there's one album that deserves returning to, that would be my pick. And if the replacement drummer is skilled (as I'm sure he is or he wouldn't have got the gig) it'll be fine, and a huge success.
Rick...I think you HIT THE NAIL RIGHT ON THE HEAD with this one!!
War was their best for me, so intense and transcendent. They never did both quite the same again,. but had some great studio albums. Bono lost me years ago.
So, I guess no "Bono interview" on the way, huh?
Remember that time U2 was busking in disguise in Grand Central Station and nobody cared then Jimmy Fallon announced it was US and still nobody cared?
The U2 Experience, with Brawndo, The Urge, Alan Claypool and Barry Muffin Snr.  I'd pay $200 to see that.
I’m a HUGE U2 fan. But without Larry, it isn’t U2.
Remerber that episode of South Park about Bono? That is all I can comment
Wow. I can’t wrap my head around a U2 without Larry Mullen, Jr. That’s like a U2 without The Edge. That’s hard No from me. 👎🏻 Sounds like the boys need to fire this new manager ASAP.
How many drummers did Spin̈al Tap have? U2 are only at drummer #2!
Achtung Baby was my gateway to U2 and has long been my favorite of their work. One of those albums where every tune on it is welcome to your ears.  And I agree with your graceful exit notion. There’s something always awkward about aged rock bands.
20%!? Seems like the manager is the 5th member of the band, not the fans.
I enjoy your channel. I’m not going to tell you how to run it. U2 are doing what they want to do - you don’t get to tell them what they should do.  Their situation doesn’t need to be compared to other bands, this isn’t the same.  See you in Vegas!
My guess is the venue is opening up and they are going to be the act for it there when it opens.  They either do it or completely miss out, its not a thing thats going to wait.  I hope he gets feeling better.
April 10, 1992 U2 @ Tempe is my favorite show ever. Achtung just hits me on all cylinders.
I've been a U2 fan since Boy came out.  It's telling that you don't list any of the Albums they released after Achtung Baby (which I agree was their greatest album, a masterpiece).  And then, they're musical mojo vanished, and sadly, they've been riding their fame since, slowly sliding into forgotten obscurity.  I suspect their residency will be shorter than they planned. A shame really.
And let's remember Larry started the band!
U2 affirming their good corporate-citizen status.    Going Vegas!   Mucho $$$$$$$$$$  is the bottom line.   Who cares about artistic integrity?
As long as people don't start hating on whoever the fill-in drummer is. People re-directing their outrage at the person who takes the fill-in gig in famous bands always disappoints me. The *band* made the decision; someone was going to be hired. Take it up with the band, not the person who said yes to a good (maybe even a once-in-a-career) payday.
Bring back the Disco Lemon! 😉  Since I first heard the opening cries and killer riff of "Gloria" . . . U2 fan 4 Life 💜
Can’t play without my kinfolk!
Rumour has it they told LMJ we can do this 'with or without you'
What's the big deal? This isn't the first time this has happened with a band. Bill Wyman isn't a Rolling Stone anymore for example.
No issue if Larry has no issues with it
I saw U2 in Denver at the Rainbow music Hall. I dont remember what year, but they were great!  Then a few years ago I saw them at the Pepsi Center and maybe they were the best Ive ever seen, and ive seen everybody. Very special band!
Either LMJ has issues far bigger than what he’s letting on and he’s played his last show, or the residency leads into a tour that LMJ will join them for.
EDGE
Also, a fifteen second ad (regardless of how much it cost), seems to me, a member of the general public, something cheap. It’s like they knew people would not like the announcement or the fact that band was minus one important member.
U2 is releasing an album of covers….of their own songs!  It’s over as a creative band & if members start dropping out it’s an even more obvious sign that they are an oldies act….not that there is anything wrong with that.  It was a hell of a run but if they are going to do a show in a 360 degree giant ball in Las Vegas, what other album to feature than Auchtun?  Hopefully they add in some Zooropa too.
I agree with everything you say here. You nailed it. I’m a huge u2 fan and have been right from their start. I just can’t wrap my head around the thinking they can do this with 3/4 of the band.  That’s not something I want to see.
I hope his illness and surgery is quick and easy. Anyone know what's that about. Regardless, unless he gave them his blessing, it's just wrong for the dollar sake
Unfortunately this is money driven, as much as I agree  what Ricks saying most fans wouldn’t care or even know who is play drums. I think it is a sad sign of the times, just get a fill in guy. I wonder what LMJ thinks about it. Granted I can’t stand Bona 😂 but don’t they enough of that tax exempt money in Ireland.
So Led Zepplin stopped in 1980 when they lost their drummer for a long time but now they are touring Rick so are you going to rant about that.
U2 is doing what David Gilmour and Roger Waters are doing.  U2 and Pink Floyd are rock legends, and they're all squeezing every last dollar out of their legacies before they fade into history.  ... I'd probably do the same.
Dang media. I'd hire a whole tribute band. Sorry , please heal & be well Larry. I'm all for orig. lineups. So....I hope the band can get to the original lineup.Maybe this isn"t up to us.
you were talking to Buddy Rich?!?!?! so jealous
You are the best
dont agree. let them play the way they want
I agree, U2 is the four guys or nothing. Plus can’t imagine how high ticket prices will be. I’ll pass.
Absolutely one of my favourite bands (and body of work) of all time, but I have to say as much as I love their best work, some essential thing started to go MIA just after Achtung Baby. It’s hard to identify, but I feel something like overthinking came into their process, and the songs didn’t always have the power of pieces like Acrobat or The unforgettable Fire or Love is blindness or Drowning Man; all pretty dark songs from a band that philosophically speaking was all about…gag… love and light. It was the perfect combination of contradictory emotional/spiritual ingredients that was in their best music and I don’t know if they’re ever gonna get that back. It has been said over and over again that you can only go to the well so many times, and this band has given me some of the greatest listening experiences in my lifetime, so I’m thankful for that as a musician and as a listener. Maybe it’s time for them to think about some other kind of collaborations with other interesting artists who pull them back to a place of musical power. Tricky. Where can I apply ? 😃😂🤣
Isn't Mullen the actual legal head of the group and NOT Bono? The one responsible for contracts and such?
ive hated them since 1976
Rolling Stones? How long have they been going for now? They will basically keep touring until Mick or Keith are dead.
"With or without you, we can play, with or without you." 🎶
Did The Cars ever get back together before Ben Orr died? I'm kinda mad they stayed broke up.
Vegas will be the downfall of all the great-but-aging musical acts, as they line up to do their version of Wayne Newton.  Sheesh, now I really feel old!  U2 plays for the Barcalounger and slot machine crowd.  What's next, the water park?  Carnival Cruise Lines?  KISS pulled the plug just in time....
Yeah, well...Why was Bono paling around with Paul Pelosi at the SOTU address? 🤔 How does Bono get into the capital building and sit next to Paul Pelosi? How does an Irish celebrity get a front row seat for the U.S. SOTU address?? Something is FISHY.
one of the most over rated bands of all time.    in my opinion.  they had a couple good songs, but to me, very over rated.
Here's a band that hasn't played live for over three years, but now they have to do this silly residency thing _so quickly_ that they're willing to play as a hybrid of U2, because they just can't wait.   Pretty silly if you ask me.
Rick needs to calm the F down…… The Beatles toured without Ringo… Larry Mullin will be back. I’ve played in bands for years, and if someone is sick, soldiering on with a sub is admirable… I don’t know why Rick is freaking out…. U2 are great… Larry is great… The Sphere shows will be great… Relax!!!!!
New fans that get into U2 get into them for 3 albums in particular, Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby and All That You Cant Leave Behind.  Yes new fans do get into U2 based on Achtung Baby because it has some of the biggest hits U2 made as a band.  This vegas residency was supposed to happen back during the pandemic but never did due to COVID.  They had already signed the contract with the venue.  Also Larry Mullen gave his blessing to have this happen.  He plans on returning to the band next year if his surgery goes well.  Get over it.  If you don't want to go to the show don't go.
I think a lot of things are in play here.  1. The Sphere has been in works for years  2. It's been rumored for over a year that the band would open the venue with a residency. Why miss out of on such a momentous occasion, the venue is supposed to be state of the art in every way and unlike anything before 3. Larry Mullen Jr has stated months ago he won't be playing with U2 the next time they gig due to scheduled back surgery. Deals were probably signed before Mullen had to pull out  4. Money. A lot of money
If Larry Mullen Jr is ok with it, I guess I am too. I hope he gets better, but he may be at the point where he's going to be healthier and happier off the big stage.
Easily the greatest rock band for the last 40+ years.
I dolike U2 but not as much as they like themselves. Look up their plans to make a museum for themselves in Dublin.
I don't get the U2 thing.   Just don't see the appeal.
Amazing how U2 went from the top band ww to a cheesy boring band… they got lost in the 90s
I'll have to respectfully disagree, Rick.  Doing live performances is what makes a great rock band great. Would it be nice if they could do this with all four members? Absolutely. But that's not possible. They didn't kick Larry Mullen out of the band. He just physically couldn't do it.  I'll withhold judgement until the show itself comes out.
Beato!
I just know I don´t want U2 to become: The Rolling Stones, Motley Crue, Black Sabbath, KISS, Van Halen, Journey, Queen, etc.
Bono's EGO
It's sad because they're one of the few bands ever to keep the original lineup, and while Larry's still in the band, it really puts a black eye on their legacy to do this. I'm never one to poo poo one to earn as much as they can but this just seems, and I hate to say it, greedy.
They're Broke!
Love your rant! 100% dead on. What a crappy way to end their legacy… Las Vegas where 70% of attendees will not be real fans. I call BS on U2. Total money grab. So much for integrity.
U2 has always been a scam and a sell-out band
U2 has been a laughing stock for decades now. Who cares what they do
I always wondered where the hell that U2 album came from. All this time, I didn't know.
If Larry's back and health are secretly career-ending bad (See: Phil Collins), then what should probably happen is Larry be the one who makes a public approval of a new drummer. Give him his credit/blessing, etc. We'd accept that. If Larry wanted to retire and the band when on without him, that'd be different.
I'm also a fan of U2. But, when Bono starts talking about his politics, I'm done.
I think U2 has completely forgotten their first few (best) albums. So sad.
Bono needs more money for charity... lol.
I mean… can he play the songs? I’m sure plenty of people will want to hang me for this… but…. If Bono and The Edge are there, I’m thinking they have no problem selling out to less die hard fans. Especially in Vagas.
1. Achtung Baby is my favorite album of all time, period. 2. Love you, Rick, but I don't get you calling on the band to retire. U2 always found a way to pivot and stay relevant. I think the residency is a cool idea since COVID knocked out the 30th-anniversary ZooTV tour idea, but I think the re-recording songs album is a dumb step. I think of this as a Ringo/Jimmy Nichols situation. No one said Larry was done forever.
The Apple force of the U2 download was classic pompous U2.
I saw them 1993 in Sydney when Adam was too hungover to perform at their first of 2 Sydney gigs (I guess breaking up with Naomi Campbell will do that). It was a phenomenal concert all the same, and I have found myself watching the concert to recapture that feeling. I agree with you Rick… Larry in the engine room and it would be impossible to imagine them performing without him for a residency. I just hope Larry gave his blessing to it.
Saw them on the Joshua Tree tour at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. Terrible concert. They had no business playing stadiums.
4 times on the cover of Time magazine. Bono believes his own press clippings & he’s not All That.
I’ve been a fan since the War album the last 3 records have stopped me caring.
Ok, yes we are of a similar age Rick and I heartily agree.  This happened with the last Black Sabbath gigs and the obviously missing Bill Ward. His replacement was great, BUT... Bill Ward was such a great drummer, especially on the first album. His jazz influence and manic style really set the tone to pieces like Black Sabbath and Iron Man. Listen to the live tapes from 1970 in Belgium. Money was mentioned but Bill later admitted he was not in the greatest health. So in my opinion, as a band, don't do that last tour at all. But back to your point, I started listening to U2 in 1982 after an Irish exchange student gave me a tape of a Dublin Battle of the Bands. Definitely into the earlier albums and would consider a quick flight to Vegas for the show. But no Larry Mullen Jr., is the deal killer. Keep ranting Rick, I'm right there with you.
U2 hasn’t released a good song since Joshua Tree
The Stones replaced Charlie Wats fgs! It's fine: show must go on!
Hard pressed to think of a band with less of a sense of humor.  My Gawd, even the melancholy Smiths and The Cure inject humor into their music - And neither took/take themselves as seriously as U2 does.  Yeah, never cared for them.  Left me cold.  Not to mention the sheer monotony of their entire catalog.
I agree. Larry Mullen Jr. has always been a pivotal element of their sound. I saw their "Joshua Tree" anniversary tour in 2017 and he was still killing it on drums. Glad I got to see him play when I did, because this announcement makes it sound like his future with the band might be uncertain.
They should take a cue from Led Zeppelin. And Larry's still around. Wait til he's fully recovered then play Vegas
My first college roommate saw U2 in Madison Wisconsin at a small club called Merlyn’s in 1980/81(?) before the band exploded.  He said “I saw this band that came all the way from Ireland that wasn’t very good”. Even legends can have an off-night I guess!
My understanding is they are now under the same management (manager) as the Eagles - which I think the question literally answers itself
Don’t care overhyped
U2 without LMJ !! What made U2 special is that you knew the 4 pillars of the band were always there on stage! LMJ is the railroad that pushes U2 forward. This is a huge money grab!! If the four members were on the stage, I would pay to see them one more time!!
U2 have been out to lunch mentally for almost three decades now. Something is wrong with these kids. Something was never right.
The edge walk into a bar and says. Can I have................................................................. a beer? The bar tender replies, sure, but why the delay?
I want to go see them. I’m interested
That Apple BS made me hate U2. I was done after that.
I guess when you have 3 million subscribers there is money to be made yelling at clouds. Did you yell at your buddy Luke for touring with five Toto replacements? If the drummer cannot physically play, are they supposed to retire?
I'd rather is exact rant had been directed at The Rolling Stones after Charlie Watts died and they decided to do the tour.
In light of the pre-march madness Luv the Rant against teams players or (bands) that do Brain dead deals  ✌☺! I Love guitar... But without the drive and pace of a great base and or Drum to pull thing together.. 😗 not a band 😉...led Zepplin knew it.. Power station Knew it .. Peter Frampton knew it..Eric Clapton Knew it...ect. ect. Will it deter people from going ☝😏.The "Name" now precedes the "group"...
The magic of U2 has always been the chemistry of the 4 members.  It'll be strange with just 3 up there.
I wonder if they already had a contract with Live Nation in place for the shows, before knowing LMJ would not be able to play?  I would love to hear Larry clear the air. If he is truly all good with it… then we should be. I hope he gets healthy and back behind the kit ASAP!!
It's probably all about the money. The annoying thing about the iTunes thing was that me phone immediately went to their tracks every single time. Load the app and even though you have other music recorded it went straight to the U2 tracks.
I totally get your point but I think you're not seeing the big picture. U2 is the 4 guys but for most people that listen to U2 the band is mainly Bono and maybe The Edge, those are the faces in the front and the people that get most notoreity. U2 listeners are mostly casual fans imo since theyre huge and have been active for a long time, and those persons only know bono, so they're really not gonna care if the drummers missing as long as there is session player that can play the part well.  U2 shows are known for being way more than the music (crazy stages, lightning, visuals, bono interacting with the crowd), with all that present, larry missing is gonna be less than a quarter of the show missing. I personally im saddened to see that larry wont be playing (have been a fans since 2009 and I love achtung baby and the old records, everything from 2009 forward is not of my taste) but theyre coming to my town I know it will be really great and unforgetable show,
Bono needs a new cause. I believe Roger Water's may have an opening.
I loved U2 back in the day. Still love them. But Songs of Innocence does nothing for me, and I haven’t been able to permanently delete it from my devices after three tries. It just keeps showing back up.
maybe they just need the 💰? 💁
There not replacing Larry for good. It's just temporary because he is undergoing surgery and needs time to heal. I'm sure once he's better he'll be back.   This gig has also been in the works for awhile now.
They once were a great band.
Bono started talking about this in his interview on the SMARTLESS podcast a few weeks ago. Didn't mention the Larry situation.  Edge fought like 15 yrs to build some mansions in Malibu and it sounds like some payments are due, is truly what this is all about.
Rick Beato, Mate welcome to New Zealand  No Crocs, No Snakes, Just going through a huge  Cyclone at the moment (Unheard of in NZ)  yes we have Earthquakes   but nothing like this beauty How ever  "U2"  most pathetic band I have ever heard mate, You have a guy (He calls himself the Edge"?????)  only knows 4  chords has 27 guitars on stage, all tuned differently   plays the same 4 chords on all of them Sure it looks impressive, but come on What a bunch of ponces they are,,,,,  Just saying
I disagree.  We love U2.  They have a major problem and perhaps we should support them for now.  The U2 I know, ain’t short of cash, mister.  They are just doing what they have to do
LMJ is great, Rick is great, U2 is great(er).  Its sucks LMJ will not be with them, that said 99.99% of people will not be able to tell the difference.  I'm sure the studio drummer they get will be a great guy and a perfect drummer.  Drumming is physically very difficult on its own, much less being 61 years old with health issues.  The show must go on, it will be ok.  I appreciate all you do Rick, but I think this topic is a bit of smart marketing/clickbait on your part.  Just to illustrate my point ( and really piss people off), How many people can tell the difference between John Frusciante and Josh Klinghoffer with their eyes closed when they are playing the same song live, I would say .0000001% (besides the fact that JF takes huge solos all the time).  Not that this is an even comparison, but look at how much negative press Vince Neal gets for being a lead singer when he is not in the same shape he was 30 years ago. Rock on U2.  If I have a spare $2,000.00 I will go see you in Vegas for sure.  I dare U2 to be the first band to not make tickets transferable...if they really love their audience, I know they wont do it, but I also know U2 does not need money and would never do anything for money.  Sorry about bringing up 15 topics, but if you know what I'm saying, I think you'll have to agree.  Would love to hear any intelligent and/or humorous feedback to my post.  Thank You!  PS Check out my YouTube Channel...it sucks (hit the unlike and unsubscribe buttons).
Hey U2; shut up and retire.
THOUGHTS ON THE “REIMAGINED” NEW TRACKS? LMJr seemingly isn’t on it either.
As I remember, the big issue with Apple forcing that U2 album on all their devices was it ate up so much storage on the iPhones that there was no room for the apps people actually wanted.  They should have just had a link to download it if you wanted the album, and let you delete it easily if you had no interest.  I'm not a big U2 fan, so it makes no difference to me, but maybe this replacement drummer will do a great job filling in.  Hopefully it's not like Alan White "replacing" Bill Bruford of Yes, where he played a much simpler beat on the classic songs that practically ruins them.
R.E.M. replaced Bill Berry and then flopped.
If all four Beatles were still alive, would you go see them if they had another drummer besides Ringo? I sure as hell would.
I wouldn't pay to see them without the full lineup.
What's wrong with Rattle and Hum, it's one of my favorite albums...
Bands go on without their lead singers and you are ranting about a drummer?  Plus it’s U2,  who cares!
If the original members, who were essential to defining a legendary group,  are no longer in the group then isn't it just a tribute band?
Please research the venue they will be playing at, state of art.
Rick…a track from Achtung Baby would make a great WMTSG ! Maybe Until the End of the World.
Agreed.  Not sure it's really U2 without Larry.  I hope that he's doing well and gets back on his feet soon.  Been a fan since they first started playing I Will Follow on WBCN in Boston.
OMG He's probably ill. If The Who, Zeppelin, Sabbath and others can forge ahead so can U2. C'mon Rick.
Paul McGuiness was the fifth member. And the four lads in stage cannot be replaced.
In full agreement Rick. Zeppelin is another band that was not going to carry on without their original drummer for good reason. Not a good decision…
I absolutely hate the superbowl halftimes. Just horrible. The best musical performance was Chris Stapleton. Unless I’m way off the mark, he played and sang live….no lip syncing. I don’t see him going for that crap.
For those of you that watch South Park, Bono is the record! Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I thought I read that Larry is sick/not feeling well, which is why he can't make it.
I don't own an iPhone. Never did. When U2 pushed that song through to every iTunes user, they lost me as a listener. Just the thought of having a song downloaded to my phone without me knowing pissed me off so much I stopped listening to them.
He is just the drummer man.
Rick i think your spot on , been a U2 fan since beginning, as you said Joshua tree and auctung baby were epic and then doing this WITHOUT the drummer is insane
How about the Stones Rick?
It's a cash grab, the well is dry and they need $$$ for the lifestyle and ego
The show must go on.  Sorry to disagree.
I get the sense the gig was already in the works but Larry had to have this surgery. I think most fans will be as understanding as I am. Especially since they’re apparently planning on going on tour after the Vegas gig WITH Larry.
I'll bet it's politics
He has an injured back and can't drum (at least at this time). Are you saying if a member leaves then the band should retire? There are many, many bands touring with changed members - Yes, the Beach Boys, King Crimson, the last version of Pink Floyd etc etc. I don't see an issue as long as you know what you are paying for and long standing members get replaced all the time - sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but its up to them and the fans (who can choose to go or not).
Led Zeppelin understood. No drummer, no band.
Hilarious . . . . . . Radiohead's 2017 Coachella vid towards the end between songs York says to audience 'what do you think about Radiohead doing residency in Las Vegas?' . . .crowd goes nuts and York guffaws as was just f-ing with them by floating ridiculous scenario.   Very funny
Maybe Bono can get a Pepsi comercial and retire comfortably.
Henry Rollins on Howard Stern talking about U2 is quite hilarious hahaha
I've NEVER been a fan of 'You Too'. Bono's off-key singing grates on my ears.
Krezip, one of the worst bands ever....
My 2 cents - most people see U2 as Bono and Edge…this news is not shocking to me. They want to get out there and play so let them.
It certainly could be the case that they signed the contract to open this new MSG Sphere arena before Larry needed to get surgery.   Think of it this way: Achtung Baby's 30th anniversary was 2021. Say they planned on doing this Sphere residency to coincide with that, but covid delayed those plans until now (it also delayed the construction of the Sphere, which was originally supposed to be completed in/around 2021). So maybe they are simply unable to postpone/cancel the shows (i.e. break the contract) without serious legal ramifications. With that in mind, and under the presumption that Larry have given his blessing for the rest of the band to go ahead with it? I'm okay with that.
Larry already said that he wouldn’t be touring with U2 a few months ago due to his surgery, so I guess he knew this was coming. He never made it sound like he was leaving the band though
When you enjoy the "Shuffle All" feature of your MP3 player the most then there is not such thing as "Just don't listen to it". I don;t know what it is about mp3 players and shuffle mode but they will always pick the stuff you least like. I have to hit the fast forward button at least three times between every song to hear stuff I actualy wat to hear...but it's still better than radio!
Well I guess they can do whatever they like. I mean if it’s just playing the same stuff every night… They’ll hire whoever they want .. perhaps even having the blessing of Larry Mullen 🤷‍♀️. ?
U 1.5  I love them but I'd give Bono one more American tour before he comes out as trans. He's already been voted woman of the year FFS !
If you were around for Achtung Baby, it means you're getting old, and it sucks. Rick, IMO you protesteth too much, now go do another WMTSG, OK?
Rick didn't even mention the lazy cash grab of a re-imagined album their coming out with.
Before I'd attack them I'd want to know what LMJ wanted. I bet this was all booked long before he was hurt.
I can't imagine how outrageous ticket prices are going to be. I've been a U2 for 30+ years and would never see U2 without Larry Mullen Jr. I'm sure the guy filling in is a fine drummer, but I don't want to see anyone else playing "Until the End of the World" or "Acrobat" as U2. It just feels like 1997 when they rushed the release of the POP album because they booked an enormous tour, but I'm guessing there were too many zeroes on the payday to pass it up.
Does Larry Mullen have a son? If not, Jason Bonham might be available.
U2 played one of my favorite shows of all time. I would never attend a show without the original line up.   I don’t even enjoy these remakes of their old songs being released because they always reinterpreted them live anyway (and they were usually better). Why paint a mustache on the Mona Lisa?
Meanwhile the replacement drummer has the time of his life. He is no session player, but a very passionate long time member of a succesful Dutch band. Nobody has ever heard of outside the country. And totally unlike U2. Give it a chance. It's either this or nothing at all.
I wouldn't walk across the street to watch U2 if they were giving away free tickets unless the Rattle & Hum album was the play list.
AND WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE FRAKIN $$$$$ TICKET PRICES ??????
The new manager always has to prove himself. Ask any blue collar worker about new managers. The proverbial punctuality & attendance warnings. People start disappearing. They know all about new managers.
Rick is such a dyed-in-the-wool YouTuber that he even refers to U2 as YouTube at 2:09 and again at 3:39
You fan guys are funny
Please wait for LMJ to heal properly and then launch a farewell tour. Make it a two or three year extensive tour. Play all the best venues in each city regardless of the size of the venue. You'll have a blast and so will we.
They HAVE played Australia without Adam Clayton due to addiction BUT the old saying “a band is only as good as it’s drummer” still holds true IMHO!!
I tend to agree.  For me, its enough already.  Just retire, fellas.  Its Larry's band!
And... what about The Eagles? They are still touring to great acclaim after Glenn Frey died.
At 2:08 he called them “YouTube” why do I notice these things.
WITHOUT LARRY THEY ARE JUST A GOOD BAND..THAT I WOULDN'T GO AND PAY MONEY TO SEE..I WAS LIKE WTF???? WHEN BONO BROUGHT UP THAT YOUNG ITALIAN GIRL ONSTAGE WITH HER TANK TOP AND SWEAT PANTS HALF NAKED DANCING AND CUDDLING HER AS HER SWEAT PANTS ARE FALLING OFF !!!!!!!! TOTALLY WRONG..BUT BECAUSE HE'S BONO HE GOT AWAY WITH THAT ??????? 👎👎👎
Thank you for doing this!!
I feel the same about the Stones . Have some respect . Stones are like “ next ! “
Imagine Rush going out on tour without Neil!!! There are some things which are sacred and should be left untouched.
I have to agree I’ve been a fan since 1980 no Larry no show for me
While I largely agree with you, Rick, The Rolling Stones have played a long time without Brian Jones. A few other musicians have cycled through that band (Bill Wyman?), and now they're playing without Charlie Watts! The Who have been performing for years with only Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey from the original lineup, and they have been sounding great - even without Keith Moon and then John Entwistle, who were both exceptional musicians. And it's not the same... Keep up the great work!
I was at that show at the Vet too! Disposable Heros of Hypoprosy opened.
Just like Rush will never record or tour again without Neil Peart. Unfortunately U2 is going for the cash grab.
Yeah this is a tough one for old fans to swallow. But their old now. Larry's on the D.L. After all the contracts, infrastructure, hiring, & scheduling has been done for the Residency. The well being of families/children, & Vegas Economy are dependent on it all. Maybe the sub drummer is a buddy of Larry's and the band? Who for years said he'd cover for him in this situation? He's not going to be taking the gig from Larry. The band has Larry's green light. He'll stay true to the grooves. Larry gets his cut. Lives aren't upended. Larry returns for the next tour. Everybody is happy!
Right on Ricky...tellin like it izzz...its MONEY AND STUPIDITY
First of all it's Vegas. Most of the people going to the show, might know a song or two and maybe they have heard of Bono, but that's it. A good cover band posing as them, would probably do as well, Vegas has become a theme park and nothing more.
I found out about U2 in 1982. Thought they were kind of cool. Bought and literally hated The Joshua Tree but absolutely loved Achtung Baby. Haven't given a crap about them since then. One of me heroes is Billy Corgan and I think he was always pissed at U2 because they claimed the Christian rock thing. Anyway, Rick totally rules.
If the drummer does well, this might give Krezip some new fans 😀
U2 fan since 82. Rattle & Hum was amazing to me too.  Didnt some suit try to suggest getting rid of Larry sometime around the album October? The band said absolutely unequivocally no! So there's at least one person who is going to watch this sacrilege with interest 🙂 Do you really need the money U2? Seriously?
With or Without Larry
I started with U2 when the War album came out. I sort of lost interest in them after Achtung Baby came out (I really liked Achtung Baby -- just not what came after). I don't criticize working people including bands that might want/need money for whatever reason. I appreciate their place in the rock pantheon and in the 1980s and just into the 1990s, they gave me great stuff to listen to. I appreciate a band that sticks together like they have because we all know how rare that is. I'm sure there is a good reason for Larry Mullen not appearing in Las Vegas for whatever reason. So I'm sure they'll get a drummer who can handle the drumming and chillax Rick.
Uncalled for rant. I'm 100% for VEGAS SHOW minus Larry. Let's go!!!!
UNO!  DOS!  TRES!  CATORCE!  I was never a big fan but when they pulled that crap with the album downloaded to iPods without permission (another "what are you thinking?" moment), I decide I had no room in my music collection for U2.
It takes a lot of fuel to fly those private jets to UN meetings. Can’t wait around for ever, ya know?
I deeply understand the need to play with and for people.
Just wait until Rick hears their rerecorded versions of their hits. "One" with just a piano? It ain't promising...
Get Rick from Def Leppard. This dude wants to play
Yeah, Led Zeppelin, without Bonham, they made the right decision.  Thought U2 was smarter, guess not.
Greed. I agree with you Rick.
Hey Rick, it'd be incredible if you interview Yngwie Malmsteen (yes my comment has nothing to do with the video haha), you can talk about music theory, composition and guitar techniques for hours with him.  He composed a Concerto, he's the king of Neoclassical style.  So well, it'd be awesome Rick! Greetings from Argentina!
U2 Boy?
Putting your feelings aside and accepting that they will do the shows with a sub for Larry, who would you pick to be their drummer?
Maybe Larry gave them his blessing and permission to do the gig. ???
they need the money... inflation
sounds like someones itching to make some bank
Saw them play War at Maysfield Leisure Centre, Belfast 20/12/82. Lost count of the gigs after that. The one I will always remember is 82. I will not be in Vegas.
U2 hasn't been relevant in 30+ years. Ever since Bono was made the Pope of Rock their music has sucked, largely, enormously. Hanging on the yachts of the rich and famous with assorted Eurotrash types does not make for good music, when he's not hanging in Davos and other woke watering holes with assorted Eurotrash types, preaching the Gospels of the Woke for all it's worth. So, it's fitting Mr Hewson & Co would end up in Las Vegas playing the Hits of the 80's for those old enough to remember. Charging how much for a ticket? A thousand bucks? Sorry, Rick, but this is just pathetic. (Can Sir Mick & Co. be far behind?)
For years / tours  now Larry has been unsatisfied touring. He has said in interviews he’s tired of being behind the kit “He wants to be out front”. The last two or three tours he comes out and plays in the round with the rest of the band. He even opens the show on the last tour. Video shoots have him in his own scenes and he requests to film in private. I hope he gets better because I agree U2 is Bono Edge Adam and Larry definitely.  Love every color and style of U2s music always have.
Totally agree, Rick. Enough already...
The band members are about 10 years older than me, and I feel like I've gone through a good chunk of my life with their music. I'll say this for U2, they are willing to try sh*t.  Sometimes it's spectacularly great--as in how they changed their sound for Achtung Baby!--and sometimes it bombs, like the Apple fiasco.  This year they are trying two things that strike me as risky: the Vegas residency without LMJ and "Songs of Surrender."  I have no idea how the residency will turn out, and the whole "Songs of Surrender" thing strikes me as anathema to the post-punk sound those songs emerged from, but I haven't heard it all yet.  But I'm happy they are willing to go out and try sh*t rather than trod down the same road others have before them.  I wish more folks were willing to take the risks they do.
So, who's going to be replacing the drummer? 🥁 🤔💭🤷🏻⁉️
I agree totally.
You are correct, Rick. They should wait until they can play with Larry. There's really no other way. Can they not learn a lesson from Led Zeppelin? Love you Rick! Take care. Cheers!
These shows will sellout in short order. The people who go see them will stay in nice hotel rooms, eat nice meals, and blow money gambling. This is a genius idea.
What they really miss is the smiling Grover Cleveland bill$.
They think they can cash in more without  LMJ , just greed!
Am I the only one on the planet who hates U2? Boring and dumb with abysmal musicianship, IMHO.
I have seen them 60 plus times going back to 1985.. Larry needs surgery and needs to recover…I am sure he has said this is okay. I also am sure there might be contractual obligations (read or listen to Bono’s book to learn how Paul McGuinness told them even God doesn’t want someone to break a contract) to Live Nation. My HOPE is that following residency Larry will be healthy enough to play on a world tour. Zoo TV toured once before and it can tour again!
Rush never, ever considered going out without Peart.  (TH Tribute aside) And never will.  Ever.
My thoughts exactly. Like what is U2 thinking?!
I guess you can *never* have enough money.
Fair call Rick.
I guess they're trying to bully the blue sky.
To me, the problem isn't the drummer. It's the lead singer. Saw The Joshua Tree Tour, he looks too old to still be doing this.
U2 was the band that got me to look beyond metal.....though I still love metal I also love what the edge brought to guitar and got many of us out of our ruts at the time. Been a fan ever since I heard those first hits on the snare on Sunday Bloody Sunday!!!!  How can they tour with out Larry!!????
I agree with a true fan being upset.  But as a managerial/financial move it’s not dumb. A band called Foreigner is filling large theaters and small arenas with zero original members. There are enough casual fans that it won’t matter, especially if Bono is there. Add to that the Vegas factor. What the heck…we’re in Vegas..,let’s go see U2!  You can justifiably criticize this on ethical and purist grounds, but it’s a wise business decision and I’m sure they need the cash.
When they announced that the Sphere was being built a year or two ago, U2 committed to playing the gig.  This was before Larry announced he was off any live gigs because of shoulder surgeries, etc.  They might have signed contracts, etc and they HAVE to play the gig, with or without Larry.  Two sides to every story.
I have been a fairweather Rick Beato fan - but no more!!! I couldn't agree with Rick more on this, however, having been a LEGIT fan since the release of The Unforgettable Fire, I think 2 things happened - 1) Larry's back issues are real - some folks have alluded to this already, and 2) Larry has almost quit the band before (I am reading Bono's book right now). Also at play is the fact that Bono (damn (and I say this with sadness) he hasn't aged well) experienced some close brushes with death in recent years that I think has moved his clock forward on his "things to do" list - including performing. Further, in the recording of Achtung Baby - as much as you want to say it's a "drum album" was not really the direction Larry wanted to go - give me the opening to SBS, brutha! AB is a fine album, but I am not as enthusiastic about it in their catalogue - totally agree with Rick - you want to see U2 because you discovered Achtung Baby? Fat chance. Astute observation on the manager as well. And I hope, I PRAY, that this is not the last of LMJ --- perhaps this is the "shock" they want (Bono has done this before) to sew a reunion tour ... and it is a one location, limited run show. That said, I would love to BE Bram van der Berg - what a gig to get! (that will be a great U2 trivia question some day... who was the guy that ...???) - no offense, but I hope to never hear the guy's name again with respect to U2 - as the Irish say, Two People Shorten the Road - hopefully back to the one and only Larry Mullen Jr.!!!
if the drummer is a pro, he won't bring the show down. Glad they are still alive.
I completely agree Rick!
I’ve tried reaching you so many times man and u never respond. I know you get a crap ton of comments but you would think after 4 years their might be a pattern.
At 5:45, I have to disagree. I'm one of those younger U2 fans (mid 20s) who considers Achtung Baby their favorite U2 album.
I can watch people's crappy phone videos LOL and that's a pain in the freaking ass to yeah I like to film yes I like to do photography no I don't do it the whole time during a concert in front of people when it's f****** bothering others it's not the same anymore
Agree 💯 you need Larry or it won't be the same. Love U2 though, and you may have just shafted your chances of getting a Bono interview. Love your channel too brother
Right on Rick. Love this rant...some things should just be called out. And...I totally agree with you...Rattle and Hum is a really good album.
Last time I saw the band U2 was in Buffalo at the Bills stadium I think it was 2018 in the nosebleeds and it was $80 a ticket or something 30 freaking dollars to park LOL yeah it was good but I wonder what the prices of the tickets there will be? Average citizens cannot afford that anymore I'd have to save up for years just to go to a concert nowadays because I'm on a very limited income so they can all kiss my freaking ass I'm not going anymore I want the $18 tickets from the 70s back
They told Larry they’re playing the gig with or without you
My initial reaction when I heard Larry was out for this was much the same as Rick's, but I think we're missing the weight of the machinery that was already set in motion behind the curtain.  Given that this was announced on such a huge stage (at such a huge cost) I would guess that this has been in the works for a while and they had every intention of doing it as the quartet they've been for decades. Following that either Larry tried to proceed with some treatments with the intent of being ready for the show but the procedure and/or recovery is not going as well as expected (w.r.t. the opening schedule for The Sphere) or something came up that necessitated treatment without the necessary recovery time to fulfill the contractual obligations.  Larry's parts and feel are crucial ingredients in the U2 sound - but a live gig is not a writing session. I'm sure that with the resources at their disposal, U2 ought to be able to find someone with the ability to fill in and do it justice for a few shows - somewhat constraining the setlist and allowing them to hone in during rehearsal. It won't be the same, but I'm sure it'll still be spectacular.  Personally I'm just glad I saw them back in 2010 on the 360 tour.
End of U2 as a band, which they have maintained for over 40 years into being an "act".
Been a fan of U2 since their second album, October (1982?). I thought they hit it out of the park with War but they just kept getting better until... Anyway, as usual, Rick's perspective reflects my own in many ways and his musicology informs me.
U2 are an absolute joke, I find it hard to believe there are people just discovering this now for the first time.
Dear Rick Beato, What Are YOU Thinking????? Clearly, you've never toured for 40+ years Whilst playing Drums with Chronic Pain And having to properly recover from the surgery. LMJ is 61 and if he NEEDS the rest then it's none of our goddam business and we should wish him well.   Sorry, Rick, love most of your channel but Unless you've drummed in another man's shoes...  Also, it was a band decision that Larry was cool with and supports, and will get a cut of the tour sales as U2 split everything 4 ways. It is Not a DISS it is a necessity.   Unless you've written:  a body of work that is as good as - October, War, The Unforgettable Fire, Joshua Tree & Achtung Baby and songs like: Raised By Wolves, Cedarwood rd, Iris, Every Breaking Wave & light of Home....maybe think before you make something as damaging as this!!!   U2 get ENOUGH unnecessary hate towards them for decades now. STOP adding to it or baiting for the clicks  It is funny how you don't get this angry when a Rapper who roofied guys, robbed them, raped them, boasted about it, and has such wonderful lyrics like ' Spit in my mouth, look at my eyes This pussy is wet, come take a dive' ....in fact, you feature this sonic excrement with no attitude!
Ac/dc many great line ups. Also although I dislike U2, I would imagine fans would prefer to see U2 rather than a …’You two’ cover band
U2 lol
I’m not the biggest U2 fan but I can appreciate your passion here Rick.   For me it would be like if Phish played a MSG run w/o Fishman.  The community would be up in arms to put it lightly.  Haha.  Love your conviction and  zero f#%!s to put it out there!!
I agree with you Rick, this is ridiculous and a bad move on their part. I'm a long time and big U2 fan but I can't condone this money grab.
I really don’t care what they do myself….they want more big money I guess can’t wait for their original guy…who is going to replace him Travis Barker!!
“Rattle and Hum” is a fantastic album. Captured a moment with the live stuff and the new songs were epic. “Heartland”, “All I Want Is You”, “Angel of Harlem”, “Desire”, “When Love Came to Town”, “Van Dieman’s Land”. That’s more great songs than some bands have in a career.
One of my best show memories. U2 1981-12-12 - Hartford, USA - Stage West.  Literally standing 5ft from Edge while having a beer. Tiny place and they were still just a "band known to the college scene"
It could have already been set up before Larry had (or needed) surgery, and it may have been too expensive to postpone/cancel. For all anyone knows, Larry could have insisted they play the dates while he recuperates.
Thank you Rick! I hope they don't impose copyright strikes on you after this.
A lot of bands don't understand the phrase "shelf life" unfortunately.
I think its complete garbage and I'll still go see them.
I'd be happy if U2 never played again.
This all sounds perfect for Las Vegas!
The Stones. REM. The Who. Kiss. AC/DC. Cheap Trick. Spinal Tap. All toured again without original drummers.
the new versions of the U2 songs are aweful, Bono's voice is gone, how will he sing those high notes on Achtung baby?
That's not a good idea
FYI  1) Mullen is having extensive surgery.  He won't recover in time for the sphere gig. 2) All of the band members regard themselves as 4 legs of a table.  If Mullen was out permanently -- U2 would be done. 3) Their first performances won't be until the fall. If Bram van den Berg can't halfway fill Mullen's shoes, the band will find out in about a week and there's time to replace him.
Who is this Phil In drummer you keep talking about Rick😉😁
I'm afraid I've got to buck the trend.... I've always thought they were bloody awful and their songs are repetitive boring unimaginative unmusical crap, led by a guy that calls himself after a dog biscuit and not to mention the feckin 'Edge' as a 'guitarist' FFS... but only my opinion
Sorry Rick I got bored with them the first day I heard them. I was on a "Yes" kick, tails from topographic oceans, sound chaser, you know. U2 sounded like watching black and white with bad reception in comparison. I kept a open mind giving them a second third try. But there formula is predictable and.....gulp, BORING 😩
U2 jumped the shark a long time ago.
Rattle and Hum was awesome! The movie was a hell of an experience. Unlike anything that had existed at the time.  People love to hate U2. They were great. They haven't released a really good album since zooropa in my opinion. And it's continued to get worse. Bono did a couple really good Beatles covers in across the universe. Maybe needs to take some psychedelics and write some songs that are actually interesting. Create a new project is relevant with or without the band. The Edge is one of the all-time most influential guitarists. As long as they we're creative.... Maybe lose the name drop some other musicians to get new Sparks off of they could create awesome music.  They are so not interesting now. Super not interesting
U2 started to lose me at  Joshua Tree (though its a great album) and that was mainly due to an “ego” that started coming from the band….and when Actung Baby was released they lost me…the ego was in full swing…  Don’t listen to their albums anymore…except for a song or two in my Spotify mix tape…
Love and appreciate you Rick! Unfair rant though…Journey, Styx, Foreigner (even Rush in recent special appearances) as  well as so many other huge bands from that era replaced iconic and/or founding members in order to keep playing. When guys are in their sixties with health problems, Band politics and such it is very difficult to keep an original lineup together. I’m grateful that these bands are at least still out there giving longtime fans and younger audiences a chance to experience some classic music live.
Grateful Dead without Bob Weir  - same thing. The Who after Keith Moon - lame.
I've been listening to U2 since the late 90s. I saw them in Atlanta in 2000 for the Elevation tour. Amazing show. But after sticking to the original lineup for so long, it just doesn't seem right to replace any of them, even temporarily.
I see why you struggled in the recording industry at times.  You aren't afraid to speak the truth.  Good take on this.  I'm curious how they are going to hold up under the residency schedule.  It's brutal.
I’m a HUGE U2 fan and I think they’ve made nothing but bad decisions since their manager, Paul McGuinness, retired.
Huge U2 fan and a drummer. Rick your rant is spot on.  WTF
There you see that it is all about money. So pathetic, they should do it only WITH LMJ and not without him. "With or without you"???
Wait until you hear about this banded called Journey.
Bad elbow? My guess is Larry Mullen would rather hula hoop naked next to a bacon slicer than play a Vegas residency: it stands for everything that the band always said they hated.
Hear you man. Too big an opportunity to turn down I’d say. With or without LMj. They wouldn’t have dared try it without either B or Edge though methinks. Will bubble the molecules nicely though for a full band tour in U- 24. Bang on saying Baby is a drum record.
Agree 100%. I think they should pursue other artistic directions. I say this with love. I was sad but also understanding when R.E.M. called it quits in 2011. They were never the same after their drummer left, even though they put out some great songs. U2 should follow suit.
Mullen made it pretty clear he would not be touring in 2023 for health reasons. He talked about injuries and needing surgery and rest. The other 3 made a decision to play for mountains of cash. I can understand the financial reasons (millionaire rock stars have expensive lifestyles) but I also suspect they know there won't be too many more of these opportunities and they may not be physically up to the task of taking them. Collectively, they are looking old and tired. They're in danger of becoming the nostalgia act they allegedly never wanted to become.
I agree with you 100% Rick!
I'm going to see'em. For all we know, Larry was probably like, go for it; I'm good.
I will not follow.
Another blunder Rick did not mention; getting stuck in a giant lemon that was on a cable coming from the ceiling of the arena down to the stage - it got stuck half way through it's journey.  Talk about a Spinal Tap moment.
Apparently U2 have millions of fans all over the world... you'd think at some point you'd see someone wearing a U2 t-shirt
It was that weird pedo-ish cover that made the iTunes stunt even more bad. That picture would pop up all the time it seemed.
They carried on With or Without him.
Why is U2 being raised to some corporate status? Why is Bono sitting front and center at State of Union Address? Follow the money..
This thing happens to all bands....  It's sad, but that's the way of the music business.
I'm a huge fan and first saw them on the War tour in the early 80's, this is a little bit sad, silver and gold indeed
Ringo owned the Beatles.  End of story.
The Grateful Dead might disagree with rotating members… 😂 … I’m on the fence… Joshua Tree tour was unreal
I feel like Bono and the Edge are what people focus on. I know many of you wont agree. Let's just be happy to see them play again after a 4 year hiatus. The real fans will be so psyched to see them no matter what they have to do to make it happen. Just my humble opinion.
I agree the optics on this aren’t great but at some point we as fans can’t be more invested in the “all for one and one for all” band mentality than the performers themselves. We simply don’t know all the finer details of their relationships and the choices they have to make. If Larry was supportive of this move who are we to judge?
I’m right there with you Rick. I’ve been a huge U2 fan since 1983.  I’ve seen them live every tour since Joshua Tree and usually multiple times.  This is how you ruin your legacy.  Huge misstep.  No Larry, no U2.  A really disappointing decision.  And as much as I love this band, Songs of Surrender is painful to listen to.
I never know what u2 is thinking  but they are my favorite band right next to the cure .
with out Larry, they shouldn't play until he's better.
I have read the first slew of comments and have not heard the reasoning I find for this situation. 1. It is because of this radical, one of a kind venue and I could see any artist wanting to be the first one to perform and I can see MSG wanting a top band to be that first act. 2. The venue is supposedly so interactive that Auchtung Baby would be the perfect immersive experience and one U2 would love to explore new technology and frankly a new form of entertainment. It is not just a concert, it is a new form of experience/entertainment. That is a hard treat to stay away from. And the timing of Larry not being able to be there is just what it is, bad timing. The SPHERE opening is a one time thing so playing without Larry just has to be that way.
even worse than the real thing
I agree with you, Rick. That was a huge mistake. They don't need such a thing. They're legends already.
I am a massive U2 fan. Saw them during the Joshua Tree tour (Singapore show) right before the pandemic hit. Back then my buddies and I were hoping there would be an Achtung Baby tour. It is hands down my favorite U2 album. This is it, sort of.   Sure, we all know it’s a cash grab. But after COVID it’s better than nothing. But I agree that it sucks that Larry’s not playing. I thought he just didn’t want to tour different venues and countries (he said as much). I thought a residency was the compromise so he could join.
I loved Boy.  That was such a great album.  I think U2 have become something else over the years.  I get it, but....WOW..Lost touch at bit? Ya think?
You know they're U2. They going to be able to get a drummer capable of filling in for Larry for this. There are hundreds of outstanding professional musicians who could step in, some of whom I'm sure you know personally Rick. They could go get a local union guy here in Vegas and he would be great.   Quit whining. If Larry doesn't have a problem with it you shouldn't.
Awesome drummer but if his surgery needs to heal then he’s best to sit out…they are launching the new stadium…Larry will be back! (I’m a drummer and LOVE your support too..) JPMusic
Pretty sure they'll sell the shows out. Not my place to tell another musician what to do.
I knew Larry had to have back surgery, but I thought this stand in drummer would be totally temporary. Also, Zooropa is just as amazing as all the previous albums.
A bonehead -Bono-head decision from my perspective. How does Larry feel about this? Cannot you postpone until he is ready to play? Are there there that many fans that don't care? Or won't notice?......
You’re a legend Rick, hope they see this
"The Joshua Tree" was a superb album. I like "Achtung Baby" but didn't love it.  But, I will say, I really loved "Rattle and Hum".  I thought that was one of their best albums!
The dude says he can’t play. Maybe he can’t ever again
Word.
Maybe LMJ is ok with it. He could be having serious health issues. I’ve been a serious fan since 1983. I don’t think this is a band that would make that type of decision lightly, or trilaterally (if that’s a word).
They probably would try it without Bono in this day and age just for the almighty $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Honestly, Bono merely existing pisses me off more than this. Him and his stupid glasses, god my stomach is churning just thinking about it.    Let's face it, Bono is just a number 2
Totally agree rick. Im a long time fan. U2 has been on a downslide for a while. Vegas residency? Ugh you guys are rich enough. BTW we might have been at same Vet stadium show Ha!
Totally agree.  Froze outside waiting in line at the Ticketmaster outlet in 1985 to get tickets for their Unforgettable Fire tour, but my credit card doesn't need to be concerned about any Achtung Baby charges hitting it this year.  Big mistake.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.  I am an Irish citizen so I'm usually interested in what U2 is up to.
I don't think we know much about why Larry isn't playing in Vegas.  Maybe surgery, maybe something more.  I suspect something more, or the rest of the group would just wait it out.
the tiny man still needs his GIANT ego massaged
Rick, I’m a 16 year old diehard U2 fan and Achtung Baby is my Favourite album ever. I became a fan at 2 years old (2011). I understand Larry is a VERY important member of the band. I don’t mind that they’re replacing Larry id just like to see him get better and perform better than ever. I understand you may disagree but I would love to see Achtung Baby live with or without Larry. Preferably with Larry but you need to understand it from the point of view of young kids or adults who never saw ZooTV. It’s U2 performing songs they haven’t performed in 30 years or have never performed before and songs that I’ve DREAMED of seeing live. I know for a fact my phone doesn’t do ZooTV justice. U2 are 60 year olds who’ve still got it! We don’t know how much longer they’ve got so we gotta see them while we can and they need to perform while they still can!
Dear U2, Achtung Baby!
Tell em Rick!
1986, I'm stationed up in Alaska. One of the guys from California mentions seeing U2 playing in a few clubs when he was there, before Unforgettable Fire boosted their popularity. Boy, October, and War I was familiar with from listening to college radio through high school. It's always been those guys. I can't imagine paying good money to see U2 3.5. Larry Mullen ought to be a part of that. Unless U2 is going to embark on the state fair circuit...
The Stones have been around longer and now we're expecting new songs and probably a tour.
I just can't stand U2. Sorry.
What's the big problem? Why couldn't bands do nostalgia tours? If they still have an audience that wants to see them, then why not. It doesn't have to be the best musical moment of your life, you go and see them for other reasons at that point.    I don't know if I would go to a U2 show anymore myself but I don't have anything against them still performing as long as they want. I saw them in the 90's after Zooropa and it was a great concert. I would have loved to see that concert in Sydney they filmed. I still get goosebumps watching "Where the streers have no name" when they light the whole stadium during the intro. What a moment!  I saw Smashing Pumpkins 3 years ago. They were nothing like in the 90's but it was still an enjoyable show for sure, a nostalgic trip back to my teenage years when they were my favorite band for a while. So, you just have to accept it's not like it was before and enjoy the moment.     Achtung Baby, The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree are my favorite U2 albums. All great in their own way.
Just heartbreaking. I remember when Larry said he’s out the moment they make a crap record. I guess this counts...
Unless Larry is dead U2 should not play with out him.
Maybe Bono got this BIG idea from this year's World Economic Foram conference?....☺️ It's a joke.. Don't get mad!!😊
The Stones replaced Charlie. They should of retired long ago!
I don't like trying to make an homage to a record and tour that in reality was breaking new ground when it arrived three decades ago. Both in the new sound of U2 and the ballsy ZooTV video/art installation/reality show concept. I understand the band want to be the first to exploit the new MSG Sphere's capabilities but at the cost of leaving a founding member at home who's on the mend (tells me U2 or the new managers don't want to wait a few months)  and that it is centered on revisiting music from thirty two years ago (rehashing rather than having new music and a new show concept that would turn fans' heads and the industry upside down.) I will be sitting these shows out.
Inflation Rick. Gotta make some dough. Greetings from Ireland.
Yeah. Probably sick. Lot of that going on these days...
Songs of Innocence is pretty damn good !
Its as if "Tool" did something like this and did't have Danny Carey on drums... Like NO
Your buddy Rich? Thee Buddy Rich? 🤔😏🥁😁
REM, Black Sabbath, Rolling Stones, The Who, Pearl Jam to name a few.
I was a U2 fan since their very first album in 1980. One of the best rock bands ever. However, their time in the sun passed decades ago. Like so many aging rock bands that continue to tour and are way past their prime, this is a money grab.
I first saw them 40 years ago this summer on the War tour and have seen virtually every tour since. You couldn't pay me to fly to Vegas, with a free meet and greet, to see this residency without LMJ.
It seems to me that if the drummer is recovering from a surgery, having a fill in let’s them do the show. Am I missing something? I could see if it’s bono or the edge. But the alternative is to cancel the show. How is that a better outcome? I’m sure the fans will appreciate they didn’t cancel.  All that said, if zeppelin did a show and I was old enough to go, and John Bonham had a fill in, it’s not the same band. So, I can see why some die hard fans would see it as a different band.
It does seem a strange thing to do, they must be doing it for the money but surely they are not desperate for the money??? I wonder what LMJ really thinks of this, I'm sure it will feel like a kick in the balls to think that he can be easily replaced. If the need to play is so great I am sure there are other ways to do it that would come over less cynically. I would like to hear more of the background to this so I can understand their reasoning. U2 in Las Vegas residency, how the world has turned upside down. When I first saw U2 live, 1980 something, Joshua Tree tour, I described it to friends as an event akin to a religious experience, now it seems the religion is the $$$$$$$$. I hate to think Bono and co are morphing into the very characters they despised in their songs.
Eh, they're bored, and want to do something for a bit. Agree I'm not super excited about it at the moment, but, nothing wrong with them wanting to do something creative again.
Two mistakes here, actually: doing it without Larry, _and_ doing it LV-exclusive.  How many people can afford a ticket to begin with (tickets to U2 tours these days certainly aren't cheaper than all the other gigs)?  And how many people can afford a ticket *and* a trip and stay in Vegas?  Money talks, to quote Milo Bloom.  I'm a big U2 fan too… but I do wish them that this turns into a flop (which it sadly won't).
You’re ABSOLUTELY right Rick. I’m a huge U2 fan too since the 80’s and and so am I very very disappointed. Come on guys !!!! F**k !!!
Larry Mullen Jr has the perfect reason for not gigging. He’s 61 and worth over 300 million. Time to relax and enjoy the fruits of a successful career.
U2 is not U2 without Larry Mullen Jr. Plain and simple. TRUTH
Only an American could say The Beatles 1964 - 1970. Glad you corrected yourself Rick😂
I have to disagree with this. A guy gives you everything he's got for 40+ years... and you get angry at him for missing 1 round of shows because he needs surgery? That seems terribly ungrateful to me.
Overrated band in my opinion
Bono is a W E F loving freak. I totally boycott his stupidity. Case in point here.
U2 Lifer here, what can I contribute besides a big sigh? Larry is THE cornerstone. Undoubtedly . His health is a priority as it should be. Will it still be a great concert? Yes. Will he be sorely missed? Yes. My lament is ,besides celebrities and influencers, who can afford to go see this residency? Especially post covid , inflation deep 2023.
Worst rock band ever. They even make joy division sound good, and man, they sucked too.
I am right with you Rick. No Larry, no U2.
What’s up with the drummer, he’s got to go into hospital or something?
I don't know.  I think Vegas, and I think "Old Elvis", Celine Dion, and any number of old lounge acts.  I suppose things have changed, but really...has it? hmmmm...  Like have maybe some class, and do a broadway thing like Bruce did.
You did say please leave a comment. So here goes. U2 is the most overrated band in history. So I'm that guy. Thank you.
It's U2 the best live band ever, don't worry it'll work
Bono is a douche.  That's all I wanted to say.
I don’t get the Vegas residency. Staying in the same place might drive them mad. Unless it’s really a retirement thing.
I dont see bands with replacements anymore. I saw chicago with Kath and later without kath. I told myself never again. I saw the stones with bill wyman then without. Never again. I saw the eagles with don felder then again without felder. Never again. Ha ha. It never quite has the same sound or feel. I always feel ripped off when i walk away from a show that had a replacement.
If I am not mistaken they had booked this show before there was an issue with LMJ.   It should come as no surprise that being the first show at the MSG Sphere in Las Vegas that they would weigh all options to keep the show going on.  All the people that are involved,  the crew.....I mean you got to understand if you really think about it.  They were contractually locked in before LMJ couldn't do it.  Of course they have his blessing and of course the show must go on.  I do understand the rant,  LMJ is as much U2 as the other members,  but just like with everything in life there are double standards.  You can get away with temporarily replacing the rhythm section in this band.
so try.  the music is the four of them.  they are four personalities i want to see on stage.   all of them.  its not the same.
Lol.  Rattle & Hum is one of my favorite U2 albums...
I hope they get Kenny Aronoff. Or Ringo.
What's more disappointing to their fans? Not doing a concert, or seeing almost all the members expect one who is some stand in. It's like Tool playing without Danny.  My mum is a big U2 fan, and I know for a fact she'd be disappointed if not all the members were there
Hey Rick, calm down. I understand where you're coming from. But don't
Relax! They're not replacing LMJ. He has to undergo surgeries for his arthritic neck and back among other areas. The band has the support and blessing from LMJ regarding the new interim drummer. No one is replacing anyone. Quite frankly I'm surprised you would make such knee jerk comments as to what's really going on without doing a little research first. Pump the brakes!
one word - GREED. "The drummer drives the band" a drummer once told me, it took me decades to realize how spot on he was...
Looking at the timeline.... I'm pretty sure it's because Larry Mullin JR didn't get the waxxine.
U 1.5
Well, Larry's got some health problems now, which may have cropped up after this whole Las Vegas thing was arranged. So, the show must go on, as they say. He can't play it right now, and I'm sure there are thousands of professional drummers who can play every single one of LMJr's drum parts. As unique as The Edge is, I'm sure there are legions of guitarists who have sorted out what he's doing on those recordings. Perhaps the only "irreplaceable" member is Bono, because he has such a distinctive voice and stage presence. Fans would feel cheated if U2 came out on stage, but rather than Bono, you had Joe the Singer up there. Actually, I think the Edge has some other guy playing second guitar below stage, so there's already some stand-ins at hand. Adam Clayton is a good bassist, but you could swap in another guy pretty seamlessly. So, big deal, they hired a different drummer out of necessity. If U2 continues to perform in the coming years, this will be an ongoing issue potentially, as with age comes health challenges.
Give 'em "What for" Rick! Hear, hear!
U2 was legendary in the early 80's....but I began to lose interest after the Unforgettable Fire album. Then....in 1988, the sound & style took a nauseating turn for the worst. Then in the 90's they became a poppy boy band. At that point, they lost their heart, soul, style, and their minds. Everything from 90's & onward, was & is, absolute rubbish & as artists, they were & are, utter failures...who are still riding the coattails of their past success. I refused & still refuse to this day, to see them in concert(as I am not going to sit through all of the garbage they made in the last 35 years, just to hear their hits from the early 80's.) They are a f**king disgrace & should have disbanded decades ago.
No longer a fan since 2023
Just a comment that U2s 1992 tour stop here for Achtung Baby is in my top 5 concerts by anyone. And they managed this in a stadium. Amazing. The tour/concert was called Zoo TV.. Best wishes to Larry for a speedy recovery.
My friend I was at red rocks concert in 1982 the under a blood red sky getting first time I saw him and then I saw him again the next night because it was so damn cold. We got invited to take a supposed to get to see him again, and see you at Medcenter with the headliners, who are by the way not U2 but the Fixx and Flock ofSeagulls!
Rick I totally respect your amazing knowledge and talent! However… my personal feeling is that your saying "Some fill-in drummer" is a bit mean spirited. And wouldn't you feel a bit embarrassed if it turned out to be Mike Portnoy or Dave Grohl?  Hmmmm… come to think of it, Mike Portnoy needs yet another band to play with!
How about this new re hashing of their old hits that sound horrible.  This new album might give the apple u2 record a run for its money.
U2 is 1 of those Bands, I never cared for, and never understood the appeal. 1, or 2 good songs, and the rest are snoozers.
I've been a huge U2 fan for the past 43 years. Since Larry gave his blessing, I'm OK with it. They don't have a tour booked, just the residency, so my hope is that Larry will heal from his surgery and be back with the band.
OK BOOMER
Might give 'em a pass if he'd passed away, but I think the fans would be willing to wait until Mullen has recovered from whatever is ailing him.
Bono has disappeared up his own bum. He is a joke character here at home.
I'm 17 and I've been a massive fan since 2017 and achtung baby has been my favourite since I first heard it i would be interested in a show like this but I live in the UK. But I do think its wrong to do it without the boss himself. As you you say it's such a drum centred album which was inspiring to me when I started playing drums. I think the shows will probably be amazing but it doesn't mean it's the right thing to do
Bono is a POS Globalist!...not a fan!
I really didn't think much about it since I stopped liking their albums in the early 2000's. But from starters the mere idea of doing a residency in Vegas sounds like a huge NOOOOOO! Now, it's utterly ironic they doing it with Achtung Baby, which was a concept that mocked comercialization. Maybe Larry just wanted to skip this one because of that which I applaud. If on top of this you think of their new album Songs of Surrender, which I'm trying to give a freepass seeing it as a type of unplugged instead of a remake of songs that never did to be re-writen since they were PERFECT, I'd fire their manager on spot.
I’ve been a fan for 30 years. U2 is easily the most influential band in my life.   The Joshua Tree was the first album I bought. U2 was the common interest that formed my relationship with my best friend in college, which continued to this day. When my brother turned 13 I gave him Achtung Baby and Joshua Tree for his birthday; he’s spent more than 20 years since writing and recording his own music. And when my 16 year old daughter created a playlist of our favorite road-trip songs for a big cross country adventure, there was more U2 on there than any other band.   I would pay almost any price (including suffering the special circle of hell that is Vegas) to see them live.   But this? There’s no way I could even call it a U2 concert without Larry Mullen Jr.
I remember the first couple of U2 albums coming out and they were very good, especially October, but since then they have not really produced anything particularly interesting, just re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic really. Very few bands have more than a couple of great albums in them - The Beatles a very rare exception - and I think many more bands should do what The Police did, and stop while they're ahead 🙏🏽 Oasis also are a bit like U2 - first two albums really interesting and exciting, but they dribbled on for many years, long after any magic had vanished 😭
Solo albums from any of them that wanted would be preferable to this.
At least the Chief's won!
You are talking about guys who run to stand still.
A fan since 1983 and this the first time I am truly baffled by what the band is doing. I was not happy about the idea of a Las Vegas residency but the thought of them doing it without their founding member is repulsive. God only knows how expensive the tickets will be. I am very disappointed in this.
What about the Stones still touring after the death of Charlie Watts?
Nice one, Rick! 👍
Wait a minute...a while back you were ok with click tracks being part of a band's performance. U2 got A. REAL. LIVE. DRUMMER. to play the parts. Would you rather have LMj's drum tracks instead for the just for sake of nostalgia? C'mon, man.
Still nothing about Television and Tom Verlaine and Marquee Moon. What a disappointment.
Where business makes the music seem cheap......in ethics.....not cost
I have seen U2 seven times since their first USA tour in 1981. I went to Achtung Baby twice, it was amazing. Bring back Larry!
Rick, this isn't like you.  There are plenty of great druumers out there...shouldn't you give them a chance before you skin them alive?  Just saying.
I cannot imagine U2 without Larry and good luck to the poor soul who has to “imitate” him.
Always did play live "pro Bono."
Screw U2, Bono is a filthy WEF-puppet!
I would think he gets a cut? If not, fire the manager, and he can be manager. Lol. Maybe he's going to die and wants to make some money beforehand.
I have been a Motley Crue fan since the mid eighties but never got to see them live. Finally, I got my chance last summer, and Tommy Lee breaks his ribs. While I would never compare the bands, just the fact that it was an absolutely devastating feeling to only see/hear Tommy for 4 songs. After all these years of digging Tommy's style and obvious contributions to Crue's sound,  it was a massive letdown. I could not imagine seeing U2 without Larry.
49 year old life long fan here. Would U2 do this without Bono? Without The Edge? Never. Larry is just as essential IMO.
Oh no!!! A different drummer! Oh, the humanity! Let's be honest how many people come to see U2 for the drummer?
Its the Larry Mullen Jnr Band, This is not U2. Long term U2 fan with 11 shows under the belt, no interest in this what so ever. No Larry, no show!
Light up people it's music and a replacement won't kill it. Larry gave his blessing so it's ok.
Is Bono still trying to recover what he lost on his Palm Pilot investment???
This one goes in the "old man yelling at clouds" file. You can't possibly know all the "what if's" that could be going on here. Is Larry considering retirement, and the band is beta testing how the fans will react to a replacement ? Is his health in question as to if he might not get back into playing shape? Wants to spend more time with the family ? (always a good one). And this will only be handful of shows out of hundreds they done and will do. Besides the drummer they got ain't no slouch, he's got some chops. I mean C'mon, 1 2 3 4 repeat, how hard can it be ?
So true Rick! Long time fan (purchased October when it came out)  big fan from that point on. First U2 show at Stony Brook University spring 1983 (senior year High School). Seen almost every tour and cant imagine seeing them without Larry. I'd be lying if I didnt ponder tickets to this though.  One show was Fall of 87 at Rochester Silver (Baseball) stadium, with Little Stephen Van Zandt and  a hip hop group I cant remember, maybe you were there...
Is it possible they committed to do this before they found out Larry needs surgery?  Is it possible he'll never be able to play again?
They were so mad about it because the cover looked like a couple fellas about to go at it.
Hmmmm.....what about WHY he isn't there? Anyone?  Forget about all the other things, in this rant! Where and why is Larry not playing this gig?  Btw....i have been a fan since 82' ✌️♥️🇩🇰
Grew up with U2.  LOVED them. Stopped listening when Bono started hanging out with George Soros, easily the most evil man in the world.  F Bono. F U2.
I used to be a big fan of the band ... but Bono big fat ego... spoiled it for me
They are going down like Bonjovi?
Rattle and Hum was a "miss-step"? I can't see how. I wasn't a U2 fan until I went to the theater with a buddy, who was a huge U2 fan. Silver and Gold live from the movie is amazing!
Vegas = free soup for seniors
While attending Berklee, I worked for a concert promoter.   Got tickets to a concert...band I'd never heard of.  The concert was U2 at the Orpheum Theater in Boston, War tour 1983.  I was blown away.  Been a huge fan ever since.  No Larry?  ... even with his "blessing"?  I'll pass
When you see Ricky Beato this mad, you know these guys are doing something wrong.
I’m sure it has more to do with the timing of the Sphere opening and contracts etc. The bigger crime is doing lounge singer versions of their hits for Songs of Surrender. Hoping they shock the world with a real rock album for their next release.
I remember Bono saying in several interviews over the years that they would never do anything as U2 unless it was the four of them. This is disappointing.
Yeah wow...I love U2 they're my all time favourite band but gee whiz they must be pretty desperate to play...and in Las Vegas!?...I think they may have only ever played live twice without Larry. I don't get it. Is it a contractural obligation thing? Very odd.
I was kinda hoping it was Bono that was gettin replaced...
Rick, please do a video on Burt Bacharach.
They lost a big chunk of a younger audience due to their iphone disaster.
One huge area of disagreement with Rick:  Boy and October are actually excellent albums.
Aerosmith waiting for their call out, too.
Achtung Baby was HATED by critics - I loved it right away.  The greatest left turn in R&R history.  U2 is gravely important and risks its reputation by being a cover band for their own songs.
Sounds like the Sphere venue wants them to open it, timing doesn't line up for Larry and Larry has given his blessing.  If he makes his $ cut, fine.  Just hurting the audience.  Anyone who thinks a drummer isn't a vital member to the band and can do shows with a fill-in, can suck it!
Rick, you are spot on. It doesn’t make sense. Neither does their 40 song reinterpretation money grab…though that’s a discussion for a different video. On second thought, knowing that they just got another new manager does explain things. Doesn’t mean either are a good move.
Achtung Baby was their last great album.
Rick, this is you at your best! Short, sweet and directly to the point.
Yeah, this is like Rush trying to play without Neil, or the Police trying to play without Stewart...it just ain't right. Not interested.
Agreed.
People need to grow up. There many bands that I would have loved to see in what ever line up I though was best or classic, whatever. Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn’t. It was however never bad, just different. U2, just like any other band, can do whatever the EF they want.
not saying i agree, but i appreciate you speaking up. everything after boy/october/war was a disappointment. but they never lost my heart. wire. heartland. one. last night on earth. elevation. breathe. a man and a woman. 43 years of me buying their stuff. vegas without larry - i'm not mad. i'm not going. but i'm not mad. btw, i've read their individual net worth's approach $9figures - so i don't think it's about money. and folks can kick bono but i appreciate his perspective - authentic or not - pulling me in the direction of my better self.
Yeah man, I thought that was stupid move from u2. I’m not a huge fan so it’s doesn’t matter to me either way but still it’s dumb. Sure there are far better drummers out there but Larry is a massive part of that band in every way. Just dumb
Over here in Ireland a few weeks back Larry Mullen Jr had said to the media that he had been putting off a surgery for the while because of touring and band business, and he said he had decided that he needs to get the surgery done now, and would be stepping away from live shows while recovering, from the piece I read it appears that Larry mullin was the person insisting that U2 should play live shows next year without him while he recovers. Although the song with or without you might take on a whole new meaning 😉.
When I see a Beato vid with "rant" in the title I click thumbs up even before the vid starts. I don't even care about U2, aside from a few songs I like, but Rick's strong opinions are always worth a watch.
I was a huge U2 fan since the late 80’s, my mom did have their Boy and War records in the mid 80’s and I liked them but I became a huge fan after Joshua Tree, specially when the Rattle and Home movie came out, I went to the cinema to watch it like 10 times! And I was 10 years old. The first time they came to México City was with the ZooTv tour, they played 4 shows here, and went to all of them! And went to every single concert they played here until the 2017 Joshua Tree tour. I even traveled to Montreal for the only tour they didn’t played here, the Elevation tour in 2001, one month after 9/11. But their music has been declining since the mid 90’s, the only thing decent after that is No Line on the Horizon, and that’s 25 years or more. I also got into more complex and better music a long time ago, but still like their old music because of nostalgia. I think they should have retired in the early 2000’s at the latest, they have been irrelevant and kind of cheesy and corny ever since. Their last albums are just bad, and even their torus are not that great, even playing the entire Joshua tree album. This is just the final straw, a Vegas residency is just too low, even for Bono.   Having said that, most fans are there because of how good they were in the 80’s and 90’s. So choosing Achtung Baby is a great decision, it’s the best album and tour of their career.
Crazy idea and a bad idea at that. It's U2 or a cover act featuring past members of the band .
I saw U2 at Yankee stadium for Achtung Baby then again at Aloha stadium with Pearl Jam. Best concerts I've ever seen.  Sad to see that Larry Mullen Jr won't be in Las Vegas, but I will!
I agree 100% Rick! That's absurd! I wouldn't wanna see them without being all 4 of them.
😂👍
I absolutly loved U2 , no other group can or will ever sound like U2 . Impermanence applies to all beings and things in the infinite and endless Universe . I will always love them , but it's time to hang-up The Ego !!!!!   PS: The truth will soon be revealed about Bono and ain't good !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sorry but you're wrong.  Most of U2 is better than no U2. All the folks that will be employed by the Vegas show will agree. It won't be as good (Probably) The show must go on. People get sick, can't play, or die. The music continues.  What's the rest of band supposed to do?  Pack it up.  And I'm not even a U2 fan.
I think Larry is OK with this set of gigs. Who am I to say what the band should do with their music? Let them play and celebrate the songs with their fans. The fans have the final say with their money. If they buy tickets... that means they are OK with Larry sitting one out. I hope Larry is OK, back problems suck. Time is shorter than we realize. I say play on!
Some bands can change members and it's no big deal. Others, like Led Zeppelin, The Beatles,  The Police, and U2 are not who they are without the original members. Period.
The Songs Of Innocence iTunes fiasco was ALL Bono's idea. He sold it to Tim Cook. They both regretted it and Bono, for once, did a mea culpa and actually put all the blame on himself.
U2 is all about $$$$$$$ at this point.  Bono has IMHO serious megalomania - the US Bank concert (worst venue in America) was final straw for me when Bono went on a half hour plus political rant, I decided that night I will never see them live again.  They were a great band for a lot of years though.
If I have to choose between a U2 record and the Forbidden city dog food album, the latter wins every time.
So many great drummers have died, and the band carried on. They are never the same without them, but this is life, nobody goes on forever, or can play when they're recovering from surgery. I'm pleased Led Zep, The Who, REM etc. didn't just stop playing live. I have no problem with U2 doing this, and I hope LMJ will be back next year.
U2 never did it for me.  Never was into the effects driven gimmicks of David Howell Evans.
Perform as BtEA or some such thing. It ain't U2 without Larry, just isn't. Everyone will know who you are, what you're going to play. If Def Leppard can wait for their drummer to heal and figure things out, so can you. People don't understand how punishing drumming can be physically.
For how long is this "residency"? It's like cashing in on a fat retirement check and farewell from the world stage. At least it's IMHO what happens to acts that go to Las Vegas for a long time. Like Celine Dion being a lot in the variety news before LV, then nothing after (not that I was complaining about that).
I don’t get it, are they supposed to stop working every time one of them takes time off for a medical procedure? They’re ancient, they’d never be able to tour again. Someone being unavailable isn’t a reason to stop working, surely.
100% agree Rick.  MASSIVE U2 fan since War!   The Vegas gig - It’s a money grab.  You miss your fans, go out and play a TOUR for cut rate ticket price everyone of them can afford …not a residency that only the wealthy can afford.  Sadly, I’ve lost a lot of respect for Bono in recent years for several reasons (and not just because there last tour was WAY to over the top with the Trump hatred.  But it didn’t help) Ridiculous.
Was REM a band without Bill Berry?
Of course Larry is one of a kind and inreplacable for the sound of the band. But it’s just a couple of gigs in a terrible city. Give Bram the change to play with his most favorite band. Give the band the change to make some money there too. They probably need it 🤔
Achtung Baby is one of my top 10 albums of all time. It came out my freshman year of high school. I do agree it's weird they are performing without Larry Mullen Jr, but also believe the band must have gotten his okay to do it or they wouldn't have... I dont think it's unheard of that a session drummer can play those parts and it still be a great show though.. but im not undermining Larry's big drive for industrial, big beat and hip hop grooves to making that record so amazing.  So while it is unexpected, I don't see these shows as big of a misstep as forcing an album download on every apple device.
With such an iconic music catalogue (Achtung Baby alone is one of the greatest albums in rock history), it would be sad to see U2 become something the group from the '80s and '90s wouldn't even recognize.
Don’t think I agree with the bit about ages of fans, I’m 18 and I love achtung baby, if Vegas wasn’t halfway across the world I would most definitely go to see U2
Perhaps Larry gave them his blessing. Perhaps the pandemic took a toll on their finances. The Who did a reunion tour to help John Entwistle get out of the red. Most likely, like most humans, they value the almighty dollar more than anything else. Even the church has to ask for money.
I think you’re way off base on this one, Rick. Just about every major band has had fill-in players when one of the core members is out of commission for a little while. Even U2 had a substitute bass player in Australia because Adam Clayton was incapacitated buy alcohol. REM kept on after Bill Berry had an aneurysm. In a perfect world, rock stars would live forever. They don’t.
Maybe it's just because my favorite band still tours and has replaced 3/5 of their original lineup over the years, but this seems like an overreaction to me. Their original drummer is considered one of the most influential drummers of the genre, but if I'm being honest, I think the current drummer is even better. Their current bassist is a solid upgrade over the original, and the current guitarist isn't exactly a downgrade.    Maybe if Larry Mullen was publicly pissed off about it, that would be one thing, but as far as I can tell, he's cool with it. Dude's 61 years old with elbow issues. I've heard from some of the faster/harder drummers that it's just not possible to keep at those paces forever. Mullen almost certainly doesn't put the same stress on his body that they do, but I've known guys in their 20s that had to retire for wrist issues. I could certainly imagine him being comfortable with his contributions and not wanting to derail the band over his health.
Agree totally Rick ! It’s a dumb move
I'd rather they give the people who havent seen them live a chance to see atleast 75% of the original U2 than stop performing altogether
100% accuracy, once again.
I'm a huge U2 fan since 1982 and unfortunately, U2 has become a corporation more than a band since the early 2000s and when Paul MacGuiness left. They should have postponed the Vegas until Larry is up to play.
There collective net worth is over a million dollars… They can’t afford surgery in time for a show in the fall? Huh?
Great post here.  Rick asks: "At what point is enough enough?"  Answer: with U2 - never.  Their egos, desire for relevance and appetite for $$$ is literally endless.
U 1.5
It's just business. Bloke's gotta make a quid.
That would be U1.5, then????
I loved U2 back in the 90's, later they came with all that merchandise paraphernalia, enjoying their stardom and in some point it was to much in my opinion. Since 2004 I'm asking myself what the hell is U2 thinking?
Sometimes it's the "commitments" that are made which keep people playing live shows long after they should have stopped...at least that's what Bob said to Ed Bradley anyway.
Why haven’t you gone on a rant about The Rolling Stones or the Who ? They’ve been milking their fans for a lot longer than U2.
Speaking as an Irish fan who's been listening to U2 since 1983, I can tell you that this is exactly the sort of thing that has alienated their Irish fans for years. So much of what they do these days is purely motivated by greed. If they were really interested in their audience, they'd wait for Larry to recover and then go out on a proper tour and lower their ticket prices so that everyone could see them.
I got into them in 1982 and saw them live in 1986, but still think they peaked with War, which is still my all-time favourite album.  Bono is worth around $700m. He doesn’t need the cash. Guys, please call it a day!
Larry was very memorably always last to leave the stage having given every last drop of energy and sweat to the gig.Maybe now he’s the first to leave the stage and if he is then I commend him on his decision.It’s possible he’s finishing what he started all those years ago and if the rest of the band had any sense and if they’re not contractually obliged to do this then they’d let it be,skip the Vegas residency and do occasional charity gigs when Larry’s better as a thank you to the fans who have supported them all through the years.Indeed,how much is enough?
I love U2 as Bono, The Edge, Adam and Larry, and for being friends and sticking out for one another. I love their team-spirit. That said, I don't really get what the fuss is about. Larry Mullen Jr. couldn't make the gig for once, so what? Ringo was once replaced in Australia. That didn't mean that he didn't come back. To quote the great philosopher Mick Jagger, "You can't always get what you want."
It's a Vegas residency. They likely signed on some time ago, before Larry's surgery was necessary. Backing out or delaying a residency for whatever reason can do tremendous harm to their reputation. Think of Britney Spears and all of her drama. U2 doesn't need another scandal. The number of people who will be angry that Larry isn't there, will be minuscule compared to the overall drama and scandal that would come with backing out completely. As to the iTunes debacle, I still haven't got that thing off of my phone. And it is intrusive. And anyway, who gives a crap if they like playing live and want to get out there? It isn't for any of us to say whether their reasons are right or wrong. It's just up to the concert goers to buy the tickets or not.
u2 is done. and imo, it's long overdue.
X2
In comparison to be in complete sellouts to the WEF, this decision is brilliant
I stumbled onto a Yamaha drum piece about Larry some 6 months back. They were visiting him at home etc.  He was heavily hinting about being beat up physically and needing serious time off to heal- he also hinted and at possibly being done with touring live as well.. His choice in the end. It ain’t easy when you got that many miles in your rear view mirror. Let’s collect all the data I’d say.. all the best⚡️
Disappointing to be sure but I don't think Larry is out of the band, right? I'm going. It's U2 + Vegas and I'm going to PARTY!
I guess we won't see "The U2 Interview".....
Never understood U2, don't dislike them just never seemed to be much different than October.
And when Larry is fine next year ¿What? ¿Everything wil be fine trying to do a new record. 🤔 And then ¿What? Leave Bono at home for the world tour. Larry don't forget this. This thing can be do It when LMJr. Will be okay to record and tour. This is only for money  and it's so ******* sad.
You're free to have and express you're opinion, Rick, but aren't the members of U2 old and wise enough to decide for themselves, with whomever musicians and in whatever formation they do or do not want to perform? It's a free world and they're free people; they don't owe anyone any explanation. If you don't like to see and hear U2 without Larry, simply don't buy tickets for these shows; no-one is putting a gun to your head to do so.
You are right ! Vous avez raison ! I saw them in 1987 (the Joshua Tree tour) in Paris. Best wishes from NAntes (France)
Agreed, big mistake, don’t tour until Larry is able.
Bono has turned into a self righteous doucher.
According to U2's egos, they're still a struggling band that needs to get their break.
With or Without You
Achtung Baby! Is the last of the great band. Haven't done anything worth listening to since.  They'll make plenty of money on this of course. Maybe Bono can do a bunch of duets with holograms of dead artists?!?!
I mean, does it matter?   They are hardly the young musicians they once were.   At this point, it must be for the fun of doing it.   They are just lucky they aren’t a punk band from the 80’s who has to tour in order to not be putting groceries on a shelf.
They want money and Larry can't do it. Collectively, they probably dropped under a billion.
If Mullen doesn't care, why should I? Lol
On U2's behalf - Larry recently had surgery and gave them the OK. Larry did say he would be on the rest of the Achtung Baby tour.
You don’t go out without Larry, you just don’t.  They are the 4 members that all the long term fans know the band by and they’re long time friends on top of it.  To me, it’s the equivalent of Geddy and Alex going out without Neil Peart and doing Rush shows, it just wouldn’t be right.  Larry is the backbone of U2.  This tampers the bands legacy in my opinion.
U2 can do whatever the hell they want. They’ve earned it. Im sure Larry is relieved that he doesn’t have to play Vegas anyway. Im also sure Larry will be taking a cut if the residency too so, just let them do their thing.
I started listening to U2 when October came out. I was lucky to finally see them on the Unforgettable Fire Tour in 1984 at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium (with the Waterboys supporting). The crowd was small enough and mellow enough that my friends and I were "elbows on the stage" in front of The Edge. I have continued to be a fan, but never saw them again because that experience was truly unbeatable. Hard to imagine a stand-in musician for any of them.
That little slime ball Bono is pushing the Woke agenda for his Satanic Overlords.
I 100% agree with everything that you said, Rick.
Bet their manager watched Baz Luhrman's "Elvis" and thought: "Vegas Baby!". What could possibly go wrong?
For what it's worth - I think Songs Of Innocence and Songs of Experience are two of their best albums.   If Larry's recovering form surgery, and the rest of the band has his blessing, I don't see a problem with this.  Drummers have it hard.
I'm a drummer who has been a fan of U2 since the 80s. I would definitely see them with or without Mullen (no pun intended). They have a prolific catalog to draw from and, if Mullen can't play, I don't think pulling the plug on U2 makes sense. Wish they could have done it with him. But there are far worse bands that carry on without a member and I don't think it's fair to be judgemental about their decision. All the fans know it isn't the same but we also might enjoy it and the other members of the band are great performers that have built their entire career in one band. Do you think they should start from scratch or what.  Many times I agree with you, Beato. But not this time.
Adam clayton and the edge are the best and BOTH English born
Some people like to perform forever (Ozzy, Kiss, Rolling Stones), some people like to enjoy their 100 million bucks and retire. I don't blame either party. AC/DC replaced the freaking singer, twice. The drummer and the bass player can be easily replaced... Apparently it is a health issue with Larry, why should the other 3 and millions of fans suffer?
It's a dash for the cash by U2 Incorporated. I love you pointing out the real artists like Sting know when enough is enough. Bono and the rest of the U2 conglomerate long ago gave up on being about anything deep and authentic.
The guys want to play, their drummer can’t, he’s injured or sick…. What’s the big rub? It’s not like they just said hey let’s get a new dude. It’s fine.
Completely awful. Larry is the soul of that sound. Without him, what the hell have they got?!?!!!
Thing is, in my view, when you get to a certain age, there's no Time to lose! Its now or never! So! Get josh freese to do it,  I mean come on,  he's a fuckin legend fill in drummer 😎 sorted
Well to me, this is it… the end of U2 (for good). Honestly, started a while ago, when Bono was everything but the front man of a past great rock band. Led Zeppelin broke up after the death of their drummer Bonham only to reunite for live concert with Bonham‘s son on drums… now that was Rock’n’Roll. U2 is pure business. Sad to end a career this way.
Been Following U2 just be4 they came Famous right from the SetGo!! .. & even to think any of the members not playing & getting a stand in is a Defo No! No!  they just a Unique Band & just cant imagine a stand in on any level. TBH tho dont know the full true story behind it & if couldnt get away from this then all good,, but when time comes to where any member cant play on anymore then thats when it be the end for U2 as no standins will ever keep them flowing & should always keep them remembered as there True Orig Form ... much love U2 Forever
I can count on two fingers the number of U2 songs I enjoy.
The iTunes thing was so odd. If they'd come out and said, "everyone can download this album for free", people would have been stampeding to download it and the PR would have been positive. But even the most successful albums ever are only owned by a small minority of the population. By forcing it on everyone, the people who found it unwelcome or unwanted far outnumber those who would have sought it out.  Completely agree with you about this new thing. It's always been all of them or nothing for this band. The timing of this seems completely arbitrary - no one is clamoring for them to do it. So why not wait until Mullen is ready? I don't get it. If he has issues that will limit his return indefinitely, why not say that?
They are saying it is back surgery, which certainly is highly possible to recover from and be fine to continue working with the band.  Unless they are completely covering up the real issue, this is all very strange.  Even Bono has said in interviews that Larry is the heart and soul of the band - I cannot understand this decision outside of health issues they are not divulging.  They do not need the money - they are all multimillionaires.  This smells like the things that Yes did to Jon Anderson or that Journey did to Steve Perry when they had health issues.  For the sake of your bandmate - wait for him to recover.
I don't believe the health issues.  I reckon Mullen Jr just said fuck that, I'm not doing a Las Vegas residency.  He's always struck me as having the most integrity in that band.
U2 is definitely one of those bands that people rave about and I have no idea why.
It’s Larry’s band.  U2 without Larry is not U2.  Can’t replace Larry’s right foot.
I guess they're stuck in a contract they can't get out of.....😄 Speedy recovery to Larry Mullen Jr.
They say Mullen is having surgery
That is not U2. That is U1.5
Larry’s back problems may be preventing him from playing. C’mon, Rick.
Honestly having seen sigur ros this last summer with the replacement drummer, it was fantastic regardless. Should somebody competent enough to not only fill the shoes but nail the feel and lift of Larry, I would hope it would be a sort of revitalization of the act.
Looking for a gig with Super Bowl 2024?
I totally agree.
Always hated U2, for every reason imaginable.
Bands switch members all the time. What's the point of watching a drummer who can't drum or an Axl who can't sing
Rick I think for once you are way off😊.  I would see the greatest bands of all time without there drummer any day of the week.  What ,I’m not going to see the Beatles because Ringo is having surgery??  I’m a huge U2 fan and am glad that I hopefully get another chance to see them even if it’s without Larry Mullen Jr😢.
I LOVE U2 WITH ALL MY HEART…Except after 2000 with All That You Can’t Leave Behind.   They lost their sound, their passion, their spirit…  Everything went studio-bluh sound and BONO’s voice was shoved in the forefront with no noteworthy lyrical poetry.  I love how Rick describes the Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby as drum-driven records.  There was distinct rhythms and uniqueness to those songs.  It wasn’t allllll about Bono’s rather annoying voice (when shoved in your face e.g. Recent albums).  Love Bono’s voice back in the day and the band is my favorite group still, but that new shi* is soulless.
LOL I remember deleting that album from my Mac
As a very big Queen fan I knew why Larry Mullen jr didn’t do the gig because of a operation. I think a huge U2 fan had to know this.
It's no big deal. Don't go, let other people enjoy it. Or hate it. (And I've been listening since my little's sister's friend took my Deep Purple record off the deck and put on Boy.)
The replacement Drummer is a Dutch Drummer from the Dutch band Krezip. If hé is good? Well we gone find out!
Yes did a similar thing when Jon Anderson got sick. They replaced him and went touring without him. He is one of the founders. When Anderson got well, he was not invited back, nor was Rick Wakeman. Anderson said they left him for dead. Then their drummer died and have replaced him. Yes is not Yes without Anderson and Wakeman.
Wayne Newton will be their opening act.
I saw U2 when they were touring for Unforgettable fire and I saw them touring for Joshua Tree. they were incredible live. This news makes me worry about LMJs actual condition. these guys dont need the money
Rick please post on Burt Bacharach. Please, please. I’m still grieving.
Man I miss the good old times being a kid, you know, when I was 33 😂
On a tangent-  **I think giving Songs of Innocence away for free SEEMED like a great idea...  and it would have seemed like a great idea to nearly anyone.   It would have been hard to anticipate the backlash.   For the record, I think it's a great collection of songs.  Every Breaking Wave, in particular.  My 2 cents.
Drummers sadly are often the most overlooked musicians in any band. Black Sabbath's final tour featured three of the four original members, but had a fill in drummer rather than Bill Ward. And honestly, Bill Ward's jazz influenced style was as integral to their sound as Tony Iommi's guitar wizardry, Geezer Butler's innovative bass work, and Ozzy Osbourne's unique vocal approach. I dare say U2 is just as much a result of ALL the original musicians.
I love U2. Was lucky enough to finally see them back in 2017 in Seattle. Without the whole band, I'm just not interested. Being a residency in Vegas? Even less interested.
Yeah, LV residency is a horrible idea...IMO. And I dig the band, from the start. No Larry?  Perhaps Larry wants to retire, and this is the replacement's "intro"? Whatever. Don't need my $, they have piles? If they're ushering in a replacement, write, record, and release an album, followed by a regular tour?
Larry is my favorite U2 member. I can't imagine myself watching a show without him on the stage.
I don't remember any of the songs from their albums after Achtung Baby.  Mostly just unoriginal drivel and neutered drums.  I remember listening to the "War" album and the heavy, distinct beat and raw sound.  "Like a Song" is drums personified.  It was mesmerizing.  As much as Edge defines the U2 sound, Mullen Jr. was the backbone of their music.  In a way, once his drumming disappeared into the cacophony of the later songs, he was gone.  What they're doing to his legacy now just seems like a continuation of where they were going.  I know that's not the case but there is some sort of macabre symmetry to what they are doing now.  Sigh.
A good majority of smashing pumpkins is all Jimmie chamberlain and his grooves
Yes sir! I agree with you 💯 it's just so odd, man.
Kind of embarrassing they are doing a "residency" in Las Vegas of all places. So much for even the appearance of socio-spiritual integrity.
U2, Rick is your new manager!
My daughter, as a Temple Mount student herself, can confirm that the school is in fact called Mount Temple!
Money grab.
Ease up Rick. I saw Yes a few years ago. Steve Howe was the only original member, but some of the replacements have been in the band longer than the original members. It was definitely sad that Jon Anderson was unable to sing with the band, but his replacement hit all the high notes and was sufficiently Elfin. Sometimes you just want to hear the songs performed. Also see: EXTC.
Now billing themselves as "World's greatest 3/4 of a Band" ? lol
U2 should have quit 15 years ago. They're burnouts.
Some drummer? The drummer they got for this concert is a real good drummer. ( I come from the Netherlands and I've seen this drummer and he's really good) I know he's not the original drummer, but let's give that guy a chance, otherwise they don't go to the  US and I think you want to see them "With or without him".
I thought this was about something important.
Been a U2 fan since War in 1983. Saw them once on Joshua Tree tour in 1987. I would not, even then, see them without LMJ! He’s the heart of the band!
I still wanna fly over from Dublin.
I think opening the MSG Sphere is reason enough to do it. Have you seen it? It takes full immersion to a whole new level and promises an audio visual experience unlike anything else on earth. 160,000 3d beamforming speakers covering 360° of the internal skin. Sound will even come from the flooring. Add in the largest curved screen on earth forming an internal 8k resolution skin, holographic technology, and the sheer possibilities of such a game changing venue ... then U2 and Achtung Baby are 'exactly' the kind of band and album that lends itself to what will be an extraordinarily immersive and artistic experience. Makes perfect sense for the opening of the Sphere ... and for the album.  My brother is a drummer and loves U2. He can't wait.
It's my understanding that Larry isn't "being replaced", but since he has been having back problems, he's currently unable to tour for this particular Achtung Baby! anniversary tour. Yes, they're having someone to fill in for him for the Vegas residency, but I seriously doubt they will just cut him loose for good. If he gets back surgery and makes a full recovery, I fully expect him to be back with his bandmates for perhaps one final farewell tour.
McPhisto must be managing the band these days.
Compare the fates of two bands that took different courses. The Who kept going after Keith Moon's death but were never the same. They couldn't replace Moon's power and drive that he gave to the music and they slowly faded into a tribute band of themselves. Led Zeppelin stopped cold when John Bonham died. And because they didn't adulterate their sound with  another drummer, their entire catalogue is still treasured to this day.
bono may be in the beginning of dementia.
Ive always hated U2
The inimitable elements of U2 are The Edge and the singer.
It is sad that Larry won't be playing at these shows, but the unofficial word is this a short term stay to kick off the opening of the Sphere, so I don't have a big problem with it. There are rumors that U2 will release an album of new songs at the end of this year and will tour it in 2024 if Larry is fully recovered from back surgery. Get well soon Larry... Hope to see you on tour in 2024.  Also, please let Bono and The Edge know that the Songs of Surrender album that will be released on March 17th was a really bad idea... Almost as bad as the agreement with Apple to put Songs of Innocence on everyone's iPhone :-)
When U2, The Who & Black Sabbath show no respect for their drummer, it makes Led Zeppelin's decision to end with John Bonham's passing all the more intuitive & praiseworthy.
Larry has the most integrity in this band, always has. I’ll bet he never wanted to do this resignation into has-been-dom. As the originator of the band I’m sure he just said, “I’m stepping out on this one boys. Enjoy your greatest hits jukebox show. …Wöt? Just tell ‘em I finally hurt my back carrying you blokes all this way”.
Can’t stand U2.
This is a ridiculous take. What if a band member dies? Do you just stop touring?  The band doesn't make money and fans miss a chance to see great songs performed live. Plenty of bands replace members and still put on a great show.
I was at that show in Honolulu!!!  I was a little upset they had postponed the show for a year and then they changed the stadium configuration and our "great" seats were now located furthest from the stage....but they rocked for sure.
"Hey dude I'm going to go see U2 in Vegas".  Are you though?
Wait full on replacing or just temporary stand in for tour?
I’m not interested in anything that includes Bono anymore especially the WEF.
My Bride and I had our first date at the Achtung Baby show on 20 March 1992 at Madison Square Garden. One of the most amazing concert experiences I've ever had. Unforgettable.
I do agree that it is weird that they do this without the original drummer, they should wait. That being said tho, the "filler drummer" you are talking about is maybe a total unknown for 99.99% of Americans, but like you, he is a massive U2 fan, and he is a highly rated drummer in these parts (Europe). As far as i know, they also have been friends for quite some time and the band knows what he brings to the table, that he can play those drum parts. So i really hope people will show him some love because he can't help being in this situation, other than that he was given the chance of a life time to play with his favorite band. Don't blame the "Filler drummer" which sounds a bit disrespectful to me.
What a load of tripe. They are doing Acthung Baby because its the 30 anniversary of the album. Back in 2013 Larry did an interview and said he woukd never do Vegas... so the surgery thing to me is an excuse. They obviously contracted through Live nation to do this and can't break the contract. Larry obviously not going to do it, so agreed to a replacement for these shows. No big deal. U2 owe their fans nothing, and with all this moaning and abuse, don't be surprised if they never tour again. U2 fans my arse.... never have I saw so much abuse over something that wad known about for months. Get over yourselves... U2 owe us 40 plus years fans nothing.
I dont see this as a very big deal honestly. Granted I'm not a big U2 fan, but I think about when Bill Berry quit R.E.M. whom I love and while disappointed, they kept growing and creating and it was good. As long as they aren't somehow screwing over Larry its all gravy.
U2 haven't been thinking striaght for years, especially Bono.
I still haven't figured out what I'm supposed to be looking for
Hey Rick, are you just as angry about the Stones doing gigs without Charlie Watts?
U2 has been the soundtrack of my life although more so since Achtung Baby but I have to agree with you on this Rick…rather poor show in my opinion.
U2 owes Live Nation some shows. They should have never signed that contract with them.
If it's 75% of U2, maybe the tickets should be 25% off
I don't mind that 3+ minutes clip that musta cast as much as an MCU movie. They're one of the biggest rockbands left. They may do that. But what rubs me the wrong way is this continuous shtick of theirs to milk 30-years-anniversaries. First Joshua, now Achtung. And look... It's ok to celebrate them. They deserve to be. But I'm thinking about lazy @ss Madonna, who can't be bothered recording a new album before going on tour now. Here's the hits. I'm Madonna, biatches. Depeche are releasing a new album before going on tour – and I get it. U2 are doing a one-time-deal. Still I want a new album. They hinted at a follow-up record to Achtung, where they revisit the fatal and misleading consumption of Media and News. They had already been very vocal about that in the early nineties, where they stated that you should def NOT believe everything they tell on TV. And here we are. 30 years later. The mainstream news are littered with garbage, lies and deception. It's be the perfect time for AB2. But no. No, no, no. Let's tell people (and I quote the baby): There's room for everyone. Yes, everyone who has the spare cash to fly to the middle of the desert into the most vapid, artificial and fake place in the Multiverse, where other artists go to die. Just for the lolz and bucks. It's PREPOSTEROUS! Give us a new album already. Throw all your money and that. And the videos, and the tour. They really need to fire their manager yesterday! ... And a wonderful rant, btw, Rick! Love ya! <3
The big issue is the fact that they’re only playing that one album (the first bad U2 album as far as I’m concerned), I could care less about the drummer and probably wouldn’t even have noticed
DANG it U2
Totally agree with you here Rick.  Disgraceful to the memory of U2!  Been a fan since the 80's and this is just shocking!  Have they not made enough money from the music industry?
True. I'm a huge U2 fan. I know all of their songs even the ones that are not famous. When they came here to the Philippines, I ensured that I was there. U2 is not U2 without any of them. Either do it with a complete line-up or don't. There's no in-between.
gotta get that paper, boy
"Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth?" yes you fucking did.  Is it any wonder that Larry wants nothing to do with Songs of Surrender and the sphere? Bono has finally become the worst version of himself and he seemingly has decided to take the songs and the band down with him. What makes it worse is that he has dragged The Edge down with him, I would of thought he would have been the one in the room saying maybe this isn't such a good idea. I was there in Sydney when they had to use Adam's tech as a replacement when he was too wasted to play and it was just a terrible night and a horrible feeling knowing that they had ditched him. This feels like the beginning of the end and it breaks my heart. BTW I've been a fan since 1983 and seen 25 U2 shows.  I was hoping you would say something Rick, because you understand how we feel.
I would think Larry is still making bank off of that residency.
most of their albums after 2000 to me just felt like they sold out or just were doing it for the money more than for the soul of the songs and the messages they wanted to share with the world.  Every album they released before had something to say, every song had a soul to it that would move you in different ways.  Just my opinion and how I've felt about it.  I love U2 but just gave up trying to come back and like their sound on any of the after 2000 albums.  I tried several times to like them...to understand where they were maybe trying to go or evolve with their new music...but for me it just no longer felt like the U2 I grew up with and loved.  Its not that the music was bad just it didn't reach me like their other previous albums had in the past.  Maybe its just me, maybe I've changed and have become set in what I like..hmmm not sure.  I feel Rick's conflict and understandable disappointment in their not doing this location based tour of an older album as the pointless money grab that it seems to be too.  I don't feel that its a bad thing to not be putting any pressure on Larry Mullin Jr. to hurry his recovery after surgery to join the tour, that is actually considerate of the band for their fellow band mate.  I'm sure if during the run of this if he actually is cleared to play and feels up to it fully that he will of course come to play and they will kick the temp to the curb...cause lets be honest there are few drummers who can do what Larry has done for U2.  I hope his surgery goes well and his recovery too.
Dear Rick, you're 100% right. I've been a big, big fan of U2 up to (and including) POP. Since then they just make boring music. It makes me sad to say so...
I think he’s done playing live. He’s self thought, has suffered all sorts of playing related injuries for decades. That German bull blood stories were around in the 90s during Zoo TV. Maybe he’ll play sessions and complete the “songs of” trilogy with them.   So now what?  He doesn’t want/can’t play live. But the other three still want to?  They never play around because of injuries or they play as they can.  They don’t need the money. They still want to live on the live space as best they can. This is it.
U2 without Larry! ?? They may as well just call themselves U after that! Crazy 😜
In 1983 as a young teen who had been listening to bands like zepplin sabbath ACDC and deep purple  U2 came into my life with the war album I have seen them many times live the first being at the miltonkeynes bowl on the unforgettable fire tour Actunge baby being my favorite album is a show i so enjoyed watching .but could i watch with out larry noway do they think real u2 fans will go to las vagas really i dont think so people enjoy u2 for there togetherness .not 3 - 1
I agree, it's a bad idea to tour without Larry Mullen, Jr. I wonder if he's really quitting?
The Filthy Lucre tour.
I believe Led Zeppelin set the gold standard for what you do when a founding member can't make it.
Is he out the band or is he just on injury leave?
Who made the right decision The Who or Led Zeppelin?
drama drama drama  makes the world go around
Its just another cash grab by a band that has not found all the money they were looking for. Just Retire !
Not a smart idea to put U2 on Apple products? GTFO here, my wife bout 2 of there albums, DL 4 extra songs and never heard of the band prior.  PEOPLE WERE PISSED BUT DONT FORGET THE GRAMMY AWARDS 2 YEARS LATER.... U2 WON LIKE 5 AWARDS.
Rick agree with you. However I don't know how severely ill Larry is. Don't you think if he was physically able to that they definitely wouldn't have him included. I've seen a lot of my favorite bands in the past that have replaced members do to health, death, or just retirement. I know it's never the same. Sometimes the substitutes are good sometimes they're just not the same. We never know till we give them a shot. It would be interesting to hear from Larry what his take is.
My sister worked for a concert promoter in Rochester NY. She got me back stage for the Joshua Tree Tour. I was over the moon, and never was I so disappointed in meeting. who at the time, were my idols. Bono strutted around backstage like he was God’s gift to women, and if he spoke to you, it was like you were having an audience with God himself had deigned to communicate with you. The Edge just shuffled around, and avoided eye contact, and Adam Clayton just chain smoked cigarettes during Los Lobos’s set. Larry Mullen Jr. was the nicest one out of the bunch. Talked to me, and asked me what I thought of the new album, and the opening act Los Lobos. He was the sole redeeming member of the band.
Thank you!
The Rolling Stones, Queen, The Who, Fleetwood Mac, Journey, Pink Floyd and The Eagles have all toured with replacement members. This may be disappointing, but it’s not unique.
Irving Azoff , U2's new management head is also the head of the MSG sphere. This deal is a natural progression and in the works for a while. It's a shame that the show will go on without Larry.
Vegas must have thrown the bank at U2 for them to even consider a Vegas residency!!  I ain't buying the explanation.
I feel sad that Larry is not doing these Achtung Baby shows.  Some very confusing and mixed messaging from the band's PR announcement on Super Bowl Sunday.  There seems to be a lot of disappointment in their fanbase at this announcement of shows happening without Larry.
I feel exactly the same way.  And yes, Zoo TV was the absolute peak of U2, which surpasses the peak of nearly every other band.  This news, along with this Songs of Surrender project, really raises an eyebrow.
Larry Mullen Jr is not well as Bono mentioned in various interviews. Larry indicated that he wanted the band to keep playing.
Same with ZZ Top . Elwood CANNOT replace The Dust . I love Reverend Willy G but $$$ is his main motivation :(
U2 sucks ass sorry but not sorry
U2 is a great band and the early records are amazing. But they are so frickin unlikeable lol
I bought The Unforgettable Fire on vinyl at a Camelot Music store in my local mall in 1984.  So, I'm pushing 40 years as a huge U2 fan.  Saw them in 1987 on the Joshua Tree tour.  I've seen them other times since then.  Each time has been an incredible moment in my life.  They don't need the money (ok, maybe the new manager does), but, still.  First off, U2 in Las Vegas????  No.  Just no.  And U2 (as Rick states) is Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and LARRY MULLEN JR.  Without him on the drums, it is NOT U2.  It's just not.  Ok, gonna step down from my soapbox now.
They should come out and say what's wrong with Larry... If he said I'm out and don't want the Vegas thing then say.... get the new drummer... Groups evolve and carry on...The Stones, The Who, Eagles, Rainbow, whitesnake..... Zak Starkey has played with The Who for 30 years.. Still carry on....live music is great..
I'd ask if Col. Tom Parker has become their manager if he wasn't dead.  This is a move worthy of that.  C'mon guys...No Larry?  WTAF?
The Police isn't such a great example of letting sleeping dogs lie. They came back and mad a fortune on tour, at least it was with the original three members.
4 years off the stages, but they cant wait 6 extra months so the freaking drummer can play? Hahaha
I love U2, but I wouldn't go see them again without LMJr. It won't be the same without him. Add the fact he is an incredible drummer.
Guess we won't be seeing "The Bono Interview" on your channel anytime soon.
Hey Rick, this is the standard operating procedure in the industry these days. There are bands out there with not a single original member in them. And I'm not talking about yes which at least has a guitarist that everyone considered to be "the" guitarist for the band. I saw something the other day that says not only does the Little River band not have any original members in it, the people in there aren't even from Australia and all the original members want to tour but can't use the name.  No disrespect to Ron would but at this point the stones are basically Mick and Keith. I don't know if this is true but someone told me the only original member of Foreigner is the manager. Let's be honest if you went to see u2 and they didn't tell you who was on the drums you never know, or at least the average ticket buyer wouldn't. I'm willing to bet as long as Bono in the edge show up that's almost people want. I'm not saying you're wrong I'm just saying that this problem is much bigger than this particular band.
I was a huge fan of Rattle and Hum. Opening with Helter Skelter was a great choice
I agree U2 without Larry is not going to be the same; but it seems like contracts for the opening of the Sphere were signed some time ago and they are fulfilling those commitments. Larry will be back when he is able to play.
100% spot on Rick.  I'm wondering if they struck the contract with MGM/The Sphere before Larry knew he needed surgery and maybe they couldn't back out.  Even so really makes me not want to see them and reeks of a money grab.  Ironically, despite Larry's drums being so prominent on Achtung Baby, the rift and difficulties within the band when making that album initially in the Berlin sessions actually centered around the initial use of drum machines and electronic sounds.  Therefore as an honor to Larry, would be even LESS of a reason for the band to do the show w/o him.  This may be management/contract issues more than anything else and agree, former manager McGuinness would have never agreed to this.
i haven't cared for U2 for 30 years ... i don't hate/dislike them , just don't care.  they represent music "Establishment" ,  the worst of it , actually.  this is just a dumb
I can understand them wanting to play live, it gives musicians a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction and identity, but a) without Larry Mullen jr is crazy and b) a residency in Vegas is super cheesy for a band that came out of the punk/post punk scene.
I guess they said to Larry "We will do it..... With or Without You" 😁
Youtube is having a Las Vegas residency according to the auto captions.
If Larry signed off on it and gave his blessing then thats life man he will come back once he is fully healed. No one is there for new music i dont think the legacy is in danger lol
Too much time hanging out with Klaus Schwab and cokehead Zelensky
I love U2, have since high school.  Is it just me or does Larry appear to be the most unhappy when they're on stage? To my eye he doesn't really look like he's enjoying playing with the band. Maybe his body language just hard to read?  Maybe he just flat out refused to go tour or is physically unable to and the rest of the band wants to so there you have it, get a fill in drummer. Fact is we don't know what's going on. Larry has been known for being a very private person and that's his right.
Nice one. Totally agree with Rick. Also, a drummer can't just phone it in. Theirs is the most demanding job. It's always questionable to do a residency in Vegas isn't it?
I saw Antonio Sánchez rehearsing U2 songs in YT
He didn't mention it, but it's kinda like Zeppelin without Bonzo. They did one show with Bonzo's son Jason on drums, and that was it. Done..
U2 desperately trying to stay relevant which they haven't been in 30 years. Zooropa in '93 was the last decent album..
Well, Sunday Bloody Sunday was good at least.
If Larry can't go, they should hang it up.  They are already richer than god, why go abase yourself in Vegas?  Ugh from a long time fan.
I’ve been listening to U2 for about 36 years, and the reason I first gravitated towards that band was because of LMJ. Something about his drumming just pulled me in. U2 was the first band where I would put on a song while exclusively listening to the drum parts. To me, he is the main ingredient in the special sauce that is U2, and it’s lame they aren’t willing to wait for him to recover before they start doing shows again. Fans are happy to wait for LMJ, it’s the rest of the band or their management that seems to be pushing; don’t blame this on the fans, because true fans feel otherwise.
I agree, Hang it Up in a classy way.  Do A full FINAL TOUR of only hits World wide (over about two Years) with all four members and then "Hang It Up" bigly In a place like London with 4 nights!
I dig old U2 -- the stuff over the last 20 years has sucked (for the most part).  There have been a few good tracks here and there, but nothing like the stuff they created way back in the day.  Sorry, not sorry.  Also, this ad/announcement is really stupid and doing it without their drummer is even worse.  Manager:  How much money can I get??  It's stuff like this that makes me not want to be a fan of the band.  It's all about money -- like they need more of it.  Ridiculous.
Agreed!
Larry Mullen has been suffering from back problems since the 80’s. It is something he has struggled with for a long time. As someone who has chronic back problems (I have two metal rods in my spine) I can understand where he’s coming from. Ultimately this was done with Larry’s blessing. He’s not being permanently replaced. I imagine that this residency has been in the works for awhile. They probably signed contracts a long time ago and are therefore committed to it.
Hello gatekeepers of U2 and Larry Mullen. Keep it calm. It's not your band lol
0:52 Dude, you've got an own Buddy Rich?!? xD
They are the band and they can do whatever they want. Let them be.
Sticking this out there. I have no knowledge of this, but, I'd put money on that Larry Mullen jr hasn't had any Covid jabs. This means that at the moment he isn't allowed into the USA. Also, I would put money that this will change by the summer and Larry will be there.
I don't have a problem with this at all.  Live music is what it's all about and many people have not had the chance to see this great band.  If Larry has given his OK then who are we to complain?
@rickbeato hear what you are saying. I am a huge U2 fan since 80’s. S till the “fill in” drummer is not that bad at all. Check the band  Krezip on you tube. Best ever gig at Pinkpop. Been to there concerts many times as well (I’m Dutch like the band). I get that U2 fans from abroad don’t know this guy. But think, how would U2 come up with this drummer if nobody heard of him?!? How did they find him…
Not much of a fan. Bono is a poser lmho
The only drummer that mattered was Neil Peart.
Stopped listening to U2 around 1985. Hard to believe they are still around. Their show in Las Vegas better be Climate Change friendly!
Not so much worried about band member replacements as much as the gap in time, at least putting out new material and hoping their entire or a good part of their fan base will pay to see and support them still, maybe they will? Look how long it took VH to get DLR back into the band and by the time they released something new, it was without much if any lasting fanfare.
Zz Top did same thing you could argue
I think Larry has had enough of Bono and Edge.  He said something recently like, ‘We don’t all believe in the same God’. I thought that was a bit strange and cryptic then this happens… Maybe he’s wise enough to call it quits.
I was 15 and saw the Achtung Baby stadium tour.  80,000 people and I was front row in front of The Edge.  Will never forget that!
I'll sum it up this way...I might see U2 without Larry if they came within 90 minutes' drive of me, but I'd only fly to Vegas to see the real deal. If I'm already there anyway, who knows...  Either way, we're accepting a bit of a knock-off without the original lineup, which is sad for all of us, including the band, I'm sure.
If Larry is OK with it, I'm OK with it.
I agree with you 100%. I could see maybe a one off show when someone is ill. But an entire residency? Maybe they're contractually obligated to start on time. It is a little weird.
Rick edited out the last part of the video:  “Can’t wait to see ‘em again in Vegas!”  😁
At 5:06 that yellow Les Paul Jr. moves!
Rick, we're getting the band back together. You in? P.S. don't tell the drummer.
As they'll be missing a quarter of the band, they should perform under the name U1.5.
Nice one Rick, keep it real!
It's exactly why I couldn't get into Yes after they fired Jon Anderson.  How the hell do you have Yes without Jon Anderson?  Drama should have been a whole new band.  The new "Yes" was really a new band.  I like the music, but it wasn't "Yes".  ABWH was more "Yes" than "Yes" was at the time.    I'm not a huge U2 fan.  If I was, I'd probably be a bit turned off.  But to those who are casual fans, perhaps it doesn't make a difference.  Maybe that is REALLY who this residency is catering...
I read news weeks ago that Larry Mullen wanted to quit U2 because of back/neck/arm issues. And because he was tired of Bono's preaching. So the latest news doesn't come as a surprise to me. The new drummer will do the job though. He's Dutch, just like me :-D
I was at the Vet in 1992. Great show!!
I was so disappointed when I read that Larry would not be playing with them. I hope this doesn't mean they're about to retire.
I personally find it hard to believe anyone would want to see U2 period. I don't get the draw. Their music, especially the guitar, is so boring to me. On top of that,  Bono always appeared to be an arrogant, attention-seeking jerk to me.  Tell me what I'm missing because I just don't get it.
I’ve been a U2 fan my whole life but their business decisions the past decade (and declining music quality) has just been disappointing time and time again. If Larry can’t play, I think we’re all fine with that being the end of the band.
Journey did a similar thing …. That doesn’t make it right. I have to agree with you. In 2000 I saw the Stones without Bill Wyman but Daryl Jones is damn good too. I guess there’s never enough even when there is
Love U2 but dear I won't see them again, something is too big and it just feels bad now.   Can they just do some small venues?
What happens in Vegas…stays in Vegas…viva Los Vegas✌️
You know, sometimes people do things for decades, and then they’re tired of doing them. Take Bill Berry for example, from REM. The drummer is arguably the most physical of any part of the band. Dude has been doing this for over 40 years. Sometimes you just don’t wanna do it anymore!
Larry's been dealing with serious back issues for many years. He's basically unable to drum anymore. It sucks but as you no doubt know, drumming is hard on the body. So yeah, it sucks that he won't be able to play the residency, but it's not like they're intentionally pushing him out. As far as the residency goes, I think it's awesome. I'm excited to see it. Touring is super hard, and they've toured at the highest level for over 30 years. Just let them do the residency and have fun.
I gotta' say, my favorite U2 album is still Joshua Tree.  Released before I was born I believe.
I think it was a large amount of space in phones that had limited gigabytes available at that point. It should've been opt in, and with more user control.  iOS updates was  creating some other havoc on its own simultaneously. Apps that people wanted to always be on their phones that were life changing, that leveled sensory access like never before were getting automatically moved off the phone to make room for mandatory updating and other stuff like this not well thought out marking scheme.   Having said all this, I do feel for the stranger who is filling in.  He's probably a professional just doing his job.
I think Bono wants to bring more $$$ to show off at the next Klaus Schwab WEF Summit.
I saw U2 when they were touring with “Achtung baby”. But I really only cared about seeing the Pixies who were opening for them…. Weird seeing pixies in such a large venue!
Can't agree or disagree with this take... would need to hear from Larry. He's happy? He's pissed? He can never play again? He wished they would wait a year? What?
Bono needs the cash for his Davos trips, and WEF membership fees!
1:22 The spirit of Larry Mullen Jr. moved Rick's guitar.
It's like doing a Las Vegas residency with a substitute vocalist, that is exactly what it's like..... Enjoy your seventeenth yacht, Bono, and your Illuminati parties I guess
Totally off topic but your channel LOOKS amazing these days. Would totally watch a BTS video on your shooting method, camera, lights, grade, etc, etc, although I'd probably be the only one watching it. Anyway, love the channel!
I saw U2 at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin during the Joshua Tree Anniversary tour a few years back. The experience was pretty good, the concert, not so much. I’m not going to say it was rubbish, but it wasn’t worth how much the entire thing cost. Luckily as part of a visit to an amazing city, and the fun of the entire weekend, that was worth it. I don’t think I would have bothered if they had announced Larry wasn’t going to be playing.
I have to agree with you Rick - I get that this venue is the hot new thing and it's going to be a huge deal, especially if opened with a residency by arguably the biggest band in the world, but it's crazy to me that they'd do it without Larry. I really want to go see it but honestly it would take away from the experience not having LMJ there. I think they should've graciously passed on the opportunity to another big draw band and come back to do their residency once Larry recovered.
Yeah this is an odd move by them and their management. U2 without Larry ain't U2.
I did not realize that Paul McGinnis retired in 2013. When I saw the quality drop  on how to dismantle an atomic bomb, I firmly believe that they should have retired after all that you can't leave behind
If only regular people knew how Bono was destroying his own country. Like and reply so Susan won't delete my comment
I get the annoyance but c'mon, no band can go on forever. They're in their 60's, likely very aware of their own limitations as ageing human beings. Who knows how many shows/tours they have left. Also, the venue in Vegas looks incredible and they'll be the first act to play inside it
Maybe Larry can get With Micheal Anthony and DLR and make a supergroup.
let the audience speak at the ticket box - they can all hang out the back with Boyz 2 men
I'm Dutch and the 'some fill in guy' is a great drummer and a lifelong fan. But i get your point.
I m not goin to attend those shows
Right On  Rick  !!
Interesting rant, I'm sure a lot of people would love to see a new version of Zoo TV for the 2020s. W Larry Mullen Jr of course, if his health permits it?
U2 has been concentrated cringe for a couple decades now. The Apple tie-up forcing an album onto people's phones, the decline of the actual music... and now a Vegas residency? They're turning into a tax-dodging Aerosmith while pretending they're still the revolutionary upstarts that sang Sunday Bloody Sunday.
U2 - Larry = U1.5  Very sad. Don't do it, guys.
When money talks integrity walks, U2 have sold its history and legacy for a Vegas cash cow. Recent interviews with Larry have highlighted that all is not well in the U2 camp
U2 lost relevance and credibility when Bono started sharing the podium with people of power.
Rick Beato: Voice of Reason. (And yes, the Stones are carrying on with Steve Jordan, but for stadiums not cabaret nights at Vegas).
That's what happens when you hang out with the World Economic Forum too long.  U2 used to be a rebellious band.  They then became a fat-cat establishment band.  It's sad for their fans, of which I was one, but I can't lie.  It's just another thing like the rest now.
Imagine being a postman where they live!
February 1982 - U2 plays First Avenue in Minneapolis. This 21 year old was there and U2 has been my favorite band ever since and I've lost count as to the number of U2 concerts I've been to.  Now living in Phoenix, I was excited when they announced the residency gig down the road in Vegas....only to learn Larry wasn't going be playing?!?!  Not the same. I hope Larry's health is ok and they consider delaying until the band is whole again.
I agree U2 has become all about the $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Their new music is horrible !!!!!!!!
I agree, even if Larry himself urged them to do this the guys should realize that they're only U2 when they're all together. That's when the magic happens. Divided, they may fall.
I'm 33, born in 1989. My favorite album of all time is Achtung Baby
I (first) saw U2 at Toad's Place in New Haven, CT in December (as I recall...) of 1980; there were about 40 people in attendance and we all became forever U2 fans, largely because of the the undeniable groove that LARRY (as he was then know on their album "BOY") laid down all night (he kept on playing until he destroyed his kick-drum 'batter' head (no lie...)!
Call me crazy, but I'm almost certain they have mouths to feed and bills to pay.
Is it possible they had signed the contract before Larry's health issue?  Otherwise, this is really weird.  Or maybe Larry didn't want to do it, and the health issue is just an excuse?
Sorry Rick but I've always seen them as the kings new clothes. Never did understand what they were about.
U2: "With or without you, Larry?!"  ... as a U2 fan, all I can say , I agree with you Rick.
I absolutely hate U2, so I wish they would give it a rest now. I was one of those people trying to figure out how to remove that album from my phone, because who wants a band they absolutely hate in their music library? The only thing that could have been worse than U2 would have been Oasis in my music library...
Seeing Bono (Is he a US citizen?) in the limelight the other Annual Politic night was disappointing.  I love Achtung Baby. Bono, one of the strongest pure voices, for their first few decades.
Bono sold his soul to the wef many moons ago
I'm assuming this Vegas MSG Sphere thing was in the works for possibly years. I'm not saying I agree with it them doing it sans Larry, but when you've got millions of dollars, a brand new state of the art venue, promotors, marketing, etc. involved, it gets difficult to stop the bus. I've been a  huge U2 fan since 1983, but between this and the lets-phone-it-in "reimagined" album coming out, I just don't know what to think about their current state. These classic songs don't need to be reimagined by the band that wrote and performed them in the first place. Maybe do a stripped down take on them a la "Unplugged" and give us two or three new songs, but this is completely stripping the magic out of the original songs for absolutely no good reason.
Hey @RickBeato: Larry Mullen Jr. already anounced last year the he won't be touring next year due to health issues. It's a bit unfair to blame U2 for it, I too had to make that choice last year and it's okay (I'd rather have a backup playing than my band playing not at all)
I’m sorry but Bono is no doubt behind it, his apology for the last f€%k up with the iTunes thing might have been the most wanky piece of s#%t I’ve ever seen. His head disappeared up his ass years ago
Without Larry Mullen it's not U2! It's U other 3!
With all respect to larry mullen you're still seeing 2/3 of a great band I don't see the gripe. It's sad to not see larry but why give up over one member.  The Stones are touring rn without charlie and still putting on great shows.
I saw the Achtung Baby tour three times. Twice in my hometown (Vancouver) and once in Dublin (a dream come true, that concert). I’ve seen U2 in concert many times and bono often goes out of his way to thank Larry for letting him (bono) “join his band”. But now they do a residency without him?? Boo and Hiss.
My mom was 77 in memory care before she died.  Rather see her than Genesis with Phil's kid or Cheap Trick with Rick's kid.  Can we call it a day?  Or just make new music that matters?
Larry is having surgery this year. That’s why he’s out for this residency.
they should call it U3....
i grew up while listening joshua tree, war and under a blood red sky, then rattle and hum struck me. at first i didn't get achtung baby, thought wtf? thats not my u2 anympre  luckily MTV played the fly over and over and over again, and somehow then it made click, than came zooropa, i almost peed in my pants first time seeing the Numb video. and than pop was even a more different but great record.  but after that they lost me. today i can't decide which is my favourite u2 album, its a tie between zooropa, achtung baby, rattle and hum (including the tunes only in the movie)  last time they played in austria in 2018 or 19 the cheapest ticket was 140euro and i nope'd, i've seen them in '93 and not willing to pay their current ticket prices. i hope larry gets better soon and i wish him all the best, but i don't care about their vegas show
Bono. The ultimate hypocrite
I think what is missing here is what does LARRY think.  He'd probably hate to be the guy that is holding back the other 3 members of the band - maybe not, but there's that possibility.  Given the brotherhood of the band, I can't imagine that this would be a long-term replacement unless it HAD to be.  I first heard Where The Streets... at 8 years old when it came out - instant goosebumps.  Having read their books, owned all their albums, and having Achtung Baby artwork in my house, I'm a pretty big fan.  I imagine that much more thought and discussion went into this than the Apple debacle - but I feel like we have to somewhat give their brotherhood the benefit of the doubt.  As for the Vegas angle - who cares if it's Vegas?  This doesn't immediately turn them into a caricature of themselves.  Vegas is already a destination for many people, so it's a somewhat democratic location for fans to come from afar to see them.  They're also in their 60s, so touring almost certainly takes a toll on the quality of their performances over time.  They also don't have to deal nearly as much with soundchecks/audio quality/audio issues if they can play the same place every night.  It might also give them the chance to try or do NEW things in a state-of-the-art venue that they couldn't pull off on tour.  Just my 2 cents - I'd definitely go see them with a different drummer as long as Larry WANTS it that way.
He might get better...
I’m shocked… the commercial didn’t show me???  I’ve hated U2’s political bullsh$t for decades!!!  Why didn’t they have me on that commercial?  I’m confused.
They should do it without Bono
Been a Fan of U2 since 1980 when Boy came out...."I Will Follow" got insane airtime, and after hearing it a few times I was hooked. Wasnt a fan of October, but loved War and Under A Blood Red Sky, which I bought on cassette....and of course HUGE fan of Joshua Tree in 1986, which I consider their best record.  So at this point, its been 47 years since they started...and if one of them is sick or injured...that is life.  The signature sounds are Bono's singing and the Edge's guitar playing...it wouldnt be a U2 concert with either of them missing, but the drums isnt a show stopper, I am sure there are tons of people who couldt replicate his sound....
I'm also a fan since I was 11 years old.  30 years.  They have a new 40-track album coming out March 17th called Songs of Surrender which is all reimagined classics in a new tone/style/production.  I'm excited for that.
It's the real thing. Almost as good as the real thing, yeah...  Did they name a drummer, or will they stoop to using tracks?
Replace Liberty and Stan...NEVER the same.  It becomes a corporation
Rick, I rarely disagree with you, but you may want to think some aspects of this through a bit more before condemning the whole thing as sacrilege.    First, would you be this upset if Larry had retired like Bill Berry?  R.E.M. went on for many years without him, and nobody suffered for it, as they had people like Bill Rieflin holding it down admirably.    Or what if U2 had simply broken up, like the Beatles?  Abe Laboriel Jr. and Gregg Bissonette, among many others, have brought Ringo's parts to new audiences for decades now.  If you can approximate Ringo's sound faithfully, don't tell me no one can "sub" for Larry Mullen Jr., or that Achtung Baby is too unique of a drum performance.  I'm both a drummer AND a huge fan, and I can tell you there are thousands of seasoned professional drummers who could do this, and if you were blindfolded you would not know.  How about Matt Sherrod, who took over for Paul Hester in Crowded House?  Simon Phillips, Zakk Starkey and others with the WHO!!!    Would you be this upset if the fill in was Josh Freese?  Or Matt Cameron?  Bram van den Berg is a bit of an unknown, which makes the optics troubling, but you've gotta give a working musician a fair chance, Rick.  Come on.  Fans are big enough jerks to absolute legends like Neil Finn and Vince Gill when they fill in, this kid doesn't need you turning a giant chunk of the U2 fanbase against him before he plays a note.      The other thing is that, if this really has been in the works for a long time, then fulfilling it is not necessarily a money grab move or something to abandon on "principle."  Lots of working people are counting on this residency.   Just a few things to consider, from one cranky old musician to another.
U2 fan since 1984. I could not agree with you more, and there is no way I’m paying to see a show without the 4 members. It’s not U2 without all 4 present.
God, I love your insights Rick, but maybe you’re wrong on this… if he can’t play, he can’t play. Irony is, if they didn’t tour anymore, people would probably bitch about that. It is what it is… let it go
I hear that this money grab is sponsored by Pfizer and a free clot shot  is included with every ticket purchased.  Also, Klaus Shwaub has been announced as the new drummer.  All hail the NWO.
I think people should keep doing what they love to do and give the middle finger to anyone that tells them otherwise. That is a different point though to performing without Larry Mullen. The reason for when and why U2 is great  is the rhythm section. They are ok otherwise both the best U2 songs have a rhythm pocket that is rarely matched. Hopefully it is a temporary thing or a commitment that was made before Larry’s shoulder issues and that they come back together and keep doing what defines them - just like we all should.
Larry said: “I have lots of bits falling off, elbows, knees, necks, and so during Covid, when we weren’t playing, I got a chance to have a look at some of these things. So, there’s some damage along the way. So, I’d like to take some time, which I will do to get myself healed.
As long as people are willing to pay for it, and the guys want to play.  There isn’t a darn thing anyone can do about it.   Congrats Bram for this amazing opportunity.
And to your point re: new (young) fans of U2 Achtung Baby -- Vegas residencies are for tourists. Young people don't have the disposable income or time to drive/fly to Vegas, get a decent hotel, buy the tickets and the swag.  It's the presence of the Empty Nesters who will make or break this Residency.  It needs to be marketed that way.   I don't go around accusing people of being stupid; they have to prove it.
Never in my top 5, but I loved U2 since early on. After Achtung Baby though, I kind of stopped caring. I think Bono especially changed from the fame and fortune and it just wasn't there for me anymore. I can't say I'm surprised that they would relinquish themselves to a residency, much less be willing to do it minus Larry. Sad though.
Larry is literally the heartbeat of the band. If he’s not there, then you’re not seeing U2.
They have enough money to last a few lifetimes. But egos are insatiable.
The last of the bands where you know all their names - John Paul George Ringo.... No Ringo?
Rick, I usually agree with you but this video is all emotion and no analysis. I get it but the band has agreed to do this historic gig after they signed a new Live Nation agreement and before Covid. More importantly, before Larry had decided to do something about his nagging injuries which only came to mind for him after watching, during the pandemic, the physical deterioration of Phil Collins. Additionally, the economics of touring  slayed a lot of tours so they’ve been holding off releasing their new album Songs of Ascent and instead released Songs of Surrender (an Edge idea from during the pandemic closures).. it is also a limited run of weekend shows so not a full tour.
Already rich people going for profit over quality. it's the saddest epidemic of the modern age
I respect Rick a lot but find his stance here really strange. He just glosses over the reason’s why Larry won’t be performing. Do you really think the band made this decision lightly? They’ve only got so many years left, let them play if that’s what they want to do. Geez.
Btw R.E.M. lost their drummer in 1996. They never were the same afterwards, but still, better than nothing
ba dum tss
Money talks and U2 are listening.
I have to laugh but the drum parts of U2 aren't that hard, and it's not me saying it but it was Cesar Zuiderwijk (drummer of The Goldon Earring) who said it on Dutch television following this news that Krezip drummer Bram van den Berg joining U2 parttime. Sorry Rick but your rant is a bloody joke and it's not even Bloody Sunday yet. Anyone that's gone to a Dutch conservatory can probably replace Larry Mullin Jr. It must be American ignorance of the skill of musicians around the world and how they are trained in other countries than the USA. The bigger issue is finding a personality that fits in with the band, and not the music itself. Even Queen had a great new lead to replace Freddy Mercury when they found Adam Lambert. Nightwish also had to go through a dip after they lost Tarja Turunen als lead vocal and in the end found something as good or better in Floor Janssen.
overreaction. 90% of the audience only wants to see Edge and Bono. 1% will miss LMJ.
Lifelong fan. Love these guys. This is bullshit. They shouldn’t play the shows without Larry. I’m not sure I can ever get past this decision.
I can understand My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult touring on the strength of what they did in the early 90s because they didn't do much after '97. So filling a room requires invoking their best stuff. U2 could play nothing from the first 3 albums and still have a great show.
As a Dutch guy, I can assure you that Bram van den Berg is an amazing drummer. He is best known in my country for Krezip. I have also seen him perform in an amazing Queen tribute band. This man can drum amazingly.
Since at least two decades, U2 is just a PR machine to generate money.
What is that guys name that played for VanHalen?
It’s U1 and a half, or so.
Black Sabbath replaced Bill Ward after 50 years. Drummers, they get old. It's the most physically demanding job of any band member, and sometimes comparing a 55 year-old back to a 60 year-old back is like night and day.
In the movie , Spinal Tap... all the drummers EXPLODE  ! 💥
Larry is actually going to join the Foo Fighters.  JK 😂🎉😢😅😮
Yes, I agree Rick - this is ABSURD on many levels. And although I'm a drummer myself, this is coming from a pretty casual U2 fan since 1988. A smart manager would have booked the residency for well AFTER Larry's surgery. A loyal band would have waited and not taken the stance of "we are doing this with or without you" - no pun intended. And then to top it off they don't get a household name like Vinnie Colaiuta to step in, they get a little-known (in North America) Dutch drummer!  I mean, congrats; GREAT gig but REALLY?? :I
Something bizarre. You mentioned the U2 drummer and his name and it dawned on me that I didn’t recognize the name or his face. Like he lived in the shadows as they became successful. Bizarre.
Do one about Ozzy!!
I'm 23 and I discovered U2 with Songs of Innocence in 2014 when I was in the 10th grade (just about to turn 15yrs old). Achtung Baby is in my Top 3 albums of all-time. I'm not sure I get your point about those younger people in the 4-minute advertisement not actually being fans of Achtung Baby. Good music knows no age limits.  I'm not gonna lie, I'd love to go see one of these shows. The multimedia experience alone sounds like it'll be incredible. Is it disappointing that Larry won't be there? Absolutely. But I can't lie and say I wouldn't kill to be there and hear all of those songs live.
Hey Rick have you covered Inhaler in a video yet? Elijah sounds so like Bono.
Yeah that is a mistake to do it without Larry. Also not quite understanding the foreboding/creepy giant ball UFO thing. Weirdly distopian, which isn't their thing.
I've been a U2 fan since October (40+ yrs)...I would actually feel awkward to be at U2 concert without Larry there
For what it’s worth for the two people to read this, I’m a life long fan of the band’s. Seen them 17 times. Even in Times Square when Bono couldn’t join. If Larry gave his blessing, then so be it. I hope to see the Vegas show. The sphere just screams U2!
Bono wants another castle.
Agreed, Rick!
They always act in mysterious ways, it's all right
Personally, I think U2 didn't go far enough. Should have replaced the bass player too. Neither one of them can keep time.
Who needs another 'pension top up' tour?
The band said to Larry we are playing with or without you!  ZooTV was the best tour in history for me. Best music and monitors and tv what more do you want from a concert?
Couldn’t agree more Rick. Been a fan since 1984 and never thought I would see them do this. Break the contract if you need to. Family first.
The whole iTunes thing was such an overblown crock. One of the first major millennial outrage events... People being totally over the top offended just for the sake of it. People were more upset about owning a U2 album than the war in Iraq
There's obviously something more to this decision that we're not privy to.  I just have no idea what that might be.
Seems like something of an overreaction IMO. U2 are the most united and stable band in history. I'm sure Larry was fully on board with the idea. And I think the whole Songs Of Innocence thing was also an overreaction.  Welcome to social media- the place where people lose their sh1t over nothing.
Try telling Rolling Stones that. Or Metallica. Or...loads of other bands that are still playing after several decades. It won't be the same without Larry but idk, maybe give it a chance? I never got a chance to see U2 live so I might actually check this show out.
This is some yelling-at-clouds level stuff right here. Miss.
haha Did you ever think that maybe Larry doesn't want to do it Rick. It's ok.
I first heard U2 in early 82 with the October album. They were phenomenal! Something about Achtung Baby had a similar experience for me - all four elements that work so well together. My drummer friends had always been especially impressed with Larry Mullin Jr. U2 has, on more than one occasion, cocked up, this being the latest
Not  sure why Peter Dinklage felt he to change his name but I'm glad he's in the band now.
I'm a huge U2 fan and I disagree with Rick. U2 IS the four guys, but what are you going to do when you can go on with 3 three other members for a few shows in Las Vegas? I don't have a problem with it. Larry Mullin Jr. probably doesn't have a problem with it, and chances are that he not only gave them his blessing, but he's most likely being PAID as well. The Killers have rotated their live-performing lineup a bit over the years, and people don't get bent out of shape. The show must go on.
I’m done with U2. It’s not the music, I love the music (except for the squashed production). My gripe with U2 started with a concert I went to see at Wembley Stadium (U.K.). It was billed as the 360 degree tour and I paid for tickets quite close to the stage for my wife’s birthday surprise. I imagined that the 360 degree referred to a rotating stage. Imagine my anger when it turned out that the stage did not rotate and even though we WERE close to the stage, we were BEHIND it! The only thing about it that was 360 degree was the giant wraparound video screen! Very occasionally, one of the band members would walk in a circle round the back of the stage and continue back to their position at the front. The sound was awful from our position and I felt really cheated. I concluded that the only reason they did this was to maximise their revenue. I tried to complain on their website the next day and was unable to do so without paying a fan club membership fee! I was outraged then and I am still angry about it now. So that is why I’m done with U2. I will never give that greedy band another single penny after the way they ripped me off.
Has Larry made a statement ?  Could they have waited to get him in better condition to play ?
Achtung Baby is my fav U2 album. It was just so radical & so different to what they had done before, yet they still managed to sound like U2. Let's hope this doesn't mean Larry is retiring on health grounds
It's the opening of the MSG Sphere. They're going to make a boatload of $$.
i've never had to down-vote a comment by you before. usually i love your stuff, but this is totally off the rails.
C’mon lads,  don’t do it.
Bram van den Berg is (as I am, too) Dutch and he was chosen by the other 3 U2 bandmembers, so he must be doing something right. If Larry's not up for it for any legit reason, give Bram a break and let him do his thing.
Love your videos Rick, you need to do a break down of Dave Knudson or do a video with him.
Now do Bon Jovi/Sambora…
I couldn't agree with you more, Rick. This smells like a big monry grab and nothing more. This is not how you cement your musical legacy.
U2 should go out in style! Rush did it when Neil Pert was gone.    The album's will still sell,  they don't need the money. Come on guys, do it with style
Speaking of bands that went on too long, you forgot to mention that the Stones continued on after Exile on Main Street, during which only Some Girls is qualitatively at par with their golden period of 1968-72.
Not a big Bono fan.   I recall Bono sending over his Musclehead Goon to knock down my friend's iPhone we he took a pic from 40 feet away.
Ummm... I think U2 has the means and should believe in the quality of their work, to hold off and wait on this residency project. Come on guys!!
I suspect Mullen being 61 is having health issues playing the drums. Look at Phil Collins - back issues, nerve problems. Even Neil Peart really struggled on the R40 tour to play at the level expected of him (and himself). He may just be done. Could also be a bonehead mgmt decision, who knows.
If The Edge was having health issues, would the band mount a residency gig with a replacement guitarist? Of course not, so what is their message about Larry's importance in the band? If Larry can't play, then get another drummer, a keyboard player and a horn section and do Motown covers under a different name for all I care,  I'd pay to see that. But don't call yourselves  U2 and perform U2 music without Larry.
U2 is a hugely creative and remarkably talented band. But, in my humble opinion, I think Larry Mullins Jr., their drummer, is the best actual musician in the band.
btw, you need to look for the borat video where he makes fun of them to their face about that itunes thing. It happened a few months ago. also that 1992 show was amazeballs.
I think most people don’t think a drummer matters (not my feeling believe me). I believe most think you can sit anyone behind the drums and it will be fine.
Bono used to visit Epstein Island.
Rick, you're so right on the money. How insulting to Larry Mullen Jr., and the army of U2 fans. The guy that started the band needs surgery, so they should be with him, their brother. Without him, there is no U2. Bono, what are you thinking ?
Simple, doing a new tour to celebrate Achtung baby anniversary with Inhaler as a support act.
U2 without Mullen is like Beastie Boys without Yauch.
Not sure if this comment was made already, but my guess is the real reason for "Sans Larry"  is that they can't get out of the contract with the Vegas venue without a significant financial penalty, and my guess is the insurance coverage didn't cover what is probably considered in the governing regulatory body (the US/Nevada) "elective surgery". It's about the money, but probably in the sense of not loosing boatloads of money due to the penalty clauses for delays or cancellations. It's the reason The Who played concerts within days of John Entwistle's death.
U2 have played exactly one show without all four members. It was a ZooTV show in Sydney when Adam was passed out drunk at the hotel and didn't show up (his bass tech filled in). He went on the wagon the next day, and none of them have ever missed a show. This is going to be weird without Larry.
Maybe….just maybe, the residency was all set up and THEN Larry got sick? Just devil’s advocate here.
Radiohead did the same thing with Smile though.
I first saw U2 in April 1981, performing at small dive club in Pittsburgh called The Decade. Although barely bigger than my garage, The Decade featured an amazing run of future iconic bands, yet to break the big time (The Pretenders, The Police, The Ramones, Pat Bentar, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Red Hot Chili Peppers, etc.). U2 played most of the songs from their first album and then one song off the yet to be released October album ("I Fall Down"). At that point they ran out of songs, so they played the set again! I've seen U2 many times since, but none more electrifying than that first 1981 gig.
Bono doesn’t just want the record….he IS the record.
After McGuiness had left managing the band, he advised them against doing the iTunes thing. Of course they didn't listen. They haven't been the same since he left managing them.
Bono and The Edge walk into a bar....The barman sighs, and says 'not you two again'!....
Bono’s gone mad anyway with his “save the humanity” BS and been prostituting himself in Davos.
We need to cash in with or without you.
Rick, you're so right
Now do The Cult, the Cure, and Everclear.  IDK how The Cult is still The Cult. Ian Astbury isn't The Cult, even if he's the Voice of The Cult.    Same with Danzig.   Bands that carry on without key founding members aren't the same band, or even the same project, as the original. Bands with only 1 remaining member are absolutely not the same band at all.
HOLY SPINAL TAP BATMAN! Apparently The Edge's favorite film...ponder...
😑
Larry is not out for a short time, he has some major health issues.
Nailed it!
Agreed. Sounds like a sell-out move, and I do not mean tickets. If they really cared about the fans they would wait until all members could make it. If Larry doesn’t want to play with them anymore, and doesn’t want the road life, then come out and say it. I would not go see this show.
This is coming from someone who listened since War...   They haven't had a good album since No Line on the Horizon.  (I liked this album)  But honestly... they haven't had a different sound since All That You Can'T Leave Behind.  They are trutly. "Stuck in a moment" and can't get out of it. :/  I love Boy - No Line...  worst song in that bunch? Playboy Mansion amirite?  lol.  But...  the rest of the stuff is just more regurgitation of what we've already heard.  :/  I'd truly love a "go away and dream it all up again" moment... but that ain't happening.
It’s about the songs
This Songs of Innocence artwork, popping up in iTunes (and in a screensaver) makes me want to puke all the time. What is the tool to delete it?
Simmer it. It's just a gig. They wanna go out and play. If they didn't have Larry's blessing to do it, I'm sure they wouldn't do it. The show won't suck. Faces will melt.
My wife convinced me to enjoy the new Pantera lineup. You can enjoy U2 without the drummer 😉
I would bet money (in Vegas during the residency, of course) that they're contractually obligated to this. Cue LiveNation hate, and perhaps whatever their manager signed. That, or they absolutely want to stick to being the first to show off the capabilities of the MSG Sphere. Everyone knows U2 concerts are technical masterpieces, MSG Sphere takes it to another level. The venue will remain (and another built in London), but only one band gets to be first.  It's been stated for more than a month that Larry wouldn't be joining this residency, and I hoped things might change before this got announced.  Obviously not.
Apparently Larry Mullen gave his blessing knowing by the time he recovers they'll be far removed from Achtung baby 30 🤷‍♂️ They are my favorite band but you're right. Time for them to have a farewell tour
Much love Rick, but out of all things you could comment or rant about, I would put this last on the list....😬 Poor Larry is getting a surgery, how do you know he didn't say, please go ahead and do the residency with his blessing? I mean, I'm a drummer, I like U2, and love a bunch of their songs, but admittedly not a huge fan, AND don't feel they're going to be losing much besides nostalgia w/o Larry playing. There's sooooo many talented drummers out there, sounds like a great chance for U2 to get someone to bridge the fan gap. Though most likely they'll get an old-school session guy to just chill in the shadows and let the other guys shine?!  It's going to be alright and hopefully Larry gets back to full health and they do a World Tour!  🙏
Come on Rick, give them a break. Cocaine is expensive!
I'm not a huge U2 fan, and maybe that's why I'm having trouble understanding why their drummer's absence is such a deal-breaker.  Would I rather see The Who with Keith Moon, or Dream Theater with Mike Portnoy, or King Crimson with Bill Bruford, or Led Zeppelin with John Bonham, or Foo Fighters with Taylor Hawkins?  Yes to all of the above!  Nevertheless, I have enjoyed seeing each of these bands play live without their iconic drummer, either in person, or on a DVD or a YouTube video.  I wouldn't have wanted to miss those performances just because their iconic drummer had passed away, or had left the band, or wasn't available for whatever reason.  Even if U2's drummer is as key to their band as Neil Peart was to Rush (and I'm not convinced that he is, but maybe), well, I would still jump at the chance to see Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson play Rush music with another drummer, because that would be better than not seeing them at all.
Who liked the Rihanna performance?
Might it be a possibility that they signed a contract to do this before they knew Larry needed the surgery?  I don’t think this developed overnight and probably was signed a long time ago.
First of all, Vegas? Seriously?  Secondly, I thought that Larry Mullen made an announcement a year or two ago, that he was no longer going to perform with the group. Have I remembered that incorrectly?  Back in the '90s, I was a huge U2 fan, and when Achtung Baby came out, it was a revelation. But then I saw them live during their Pop Mart tour, and that ended it for me.
Got to rock on.
It's their call if they wanna do it that way kinda like R.E.M. carried on without Bill Berry with Bill's blessing of course.
LOL. It's like the Police without Stewart. Unthinkable. Somethings you just don't do. And I don't even particularly like U2.
Money grabbing Irish
U2 have written a ton of amazing songs over the decades. Buuuuuuuuuut:  Bono.
All I know is the Super Bowl is in Las Vegas next year. If The Killers are not at least whispered as a thought for consideration for the halftime show I’m going to be FUCKING FURIOUS
I heard that the re-mastering team was working on this 5 years ago.
How could Rush ever replace Neil Peart? Or, how could Led Zeppelin ever replace John Bonham? Short answer: They can’t, and — thankfully — they never tried!! I’m with Rick on this one.
I mean, getting their album on every iTunes library, I kinda get why they went for it. It's easy to slander them in hindsight, and it was a gamble. But, no one could've predicted it would get as much hate as it did. Not to mention around this time, a lot of artists were experimenting with different ways to do album releases. Björk made an app, Radiohead did the whole "pay what you want"-thing. I'm sure they all just saw it as a huge opportunity they couldn't say no to, band members themselves included.
Bono needs vacation home number 14.
The three singles on spotify from the new album sound promising!
That is not U2, is theee guys from U2 with a drummer.
Love U2 and recall how Peart regarded surrender.
Bono is crown prince of the deep state shills
In a way I agree, but I've also seen Guns n Roses when Axl Rose was the only remaining member. It was still Guns n Roses.  There are certain members of bands that can't be replaced, but a drummer almost always isn't one of them. I'd probably see the show if I could. I saw them around 2011 and could barely see Mullen from where I was sitting anyway.
Disagree on the fans of that album stuff. I love when Iron Maiden did their tours on classic periods of their catalog and bring out songs from albums that many of the young generation, including me, weren't able to enjoy live..
U2 and especially Bono have become distant shadows of themselves. Bono hasn’t aged well (he looks like he’s in his 70’s). This is sad news all around.
Old man yells at cloud
Right on. I waited outside tower records for Achtung Baby to be released after midnight in 1991. That was the pinnacle. That Horizon LP was the last I bought. The old things are still moving, but the gimmicky thing catches up with you… they need to age more gracefully.
As long as Bono and the Edge are there, that's all that matters. I was 24 when their first album came out.
I saw them in Toronto more than a decade ago. Larry looked like he hated being there. Maybe he's just tired of being away from home. It killed John Bonham.
The rest of the band are itching to play and yes make some coin so who can blame them. They definitely will have an audience but for this stand they should rebrand themselves U 3/4 so they make it understood that they aren't the complete band but you still get a good show...
Larry needs to let us know what is going on, fans want to know.
$$$$$$$$$$$
This is a bit of a OLD MAN YELLS AT CLOUD moment for you Rick. It's just a few shows, and if heaven forbid Larry's health is worse than known, then should they never play again if he can't. I'm sure he wouldn't want his mates to have to stop because of him.
Rick's a legend for telling it like it is. I'm convinced he'd tell Bono and Edge to their face. 😂👏🔥
U2 is dead to me
If Larry doesn't care, or is over playing live then go for it. I think they should let him get the surgery and get fit again. Then play a tour
I'd like to ask Edge and Adam what are they thinking? I'll give Larry a pass. This is not U2. Shame on you. Just stop, if that's what it has come to.
Deep Purple made some absolutely fantastic records with Tommy Bolin, and Steve Morse after Ritchie Blackmore. They even had great replacement singers (Glenn Hughes and David Coverdale). But they could nok replace Ian Paice. I think - in U2 - noone is replacable
There can be no Pretenders without James Honeyman Scott. No Ozzy Osbourne without Randy Rhoads. No Doors without Jim Morrison. No U2 without...
Larry's rhythms makes so many records what they are.Its not about art it's about money. Not approved by me a fan.
Good afternoon Rick. A little off topic and I love your vids but am a little disappointed no mention of the passing of Burt Bacharach.
You could not be more right about this! Always the drummer is always replaceable...NOT!
This is one news story that won't affect me in any way shape or form 🙂
I hope Larry is OK. Replacing him, even briefly, seems drastic. There must be a whole lot more to this story. Why the urgency? Financial pressure? Is it possible that Larry does not expect to perform again? A million questions...
This will be as nauseating as if Rush did one more show with a fill-in drummer. Terrible mistake!
They've been a product for a long time. Remember the connection they had to their audience. It's hard to hold that connection when you're living in Monaco.  Actung Baby was okay but they peaked at Unforgettable Fire and it's been downhill since then.
I would prefer they did it without bono but kept larry..
I'm surprised they didn't get Dave Grohl to play drums.
Rick, Veterans Stadium in Philly? I was at that same show. 😊 Oh yeah, I’m not going to see them without Larry.
OMG U2 is pulling an Elvis.  I agree 100% we all took this journey together.  When one of us decides it's done, we all follow.  Do solo work.  You are going to turn into Blackfoot.  pathetic money grab.  Can't wait to hear the thousand topping salad bar chatter between songs.  I mean..  have you seen that buffet?  Just too many choices for one person.  Lemon..  see thru in the sunlight...
One thing I haven't seen anyone mention is that this could be permanent. Mullen's had pain for years and none of us can ever know when the end may come for him. But musicians play music - they have to. So what are the other three guys supposed to do? Become accountants?  Change is a part of life. It's rarely comfortable but it's never avoidable.
If I had to take a stab at it, They are contractually obligated to do the stint and obviously Larry Mullen can't make it. You would never expect it, from the bands position, Larry runs the band, and nothing happens in U2 if he disapproves. You can't seriously think that they need to see faces is a "real" reason  On another note, Ive been a U2 fan since "I Will Follow" hit MTV. At the time it was a completely fresh sound and they followed that up with Sunday Bloody Sunday! They were the  Pearl Jam of the 80's! Records 2-7 were just all monsters IMO. I hated Achtung Baby when it came out. it has a couple of songs on it but nothing I would be dying to go see, especially without the full line up.
Saw them in Jax Florida right after they released the Unforgettable Fire.  So the set list is from Boy October War and UFF...  it doesn't get any better.  No politics or crazy stages.  Just U2 playing hit after hit...
" It's  a musical  journey......."    Can't  do it without  Larry Mullen  Jr.
I say give the new drummer a chance. Health problems or worse happen. Like you said, band members sometimes change. Nothing wrong with the band trying to carry on. At least wait until you hear the band. Then you can set your hair on fire and rant all you want. Now that would be some video!
Signing up for a Las Vegas residency is the musician's equivalent of checking into a VA convalescent home. Looks like they're done.
We miss the fans so much...more a question of keeping the money machine rolling; concerts in Las Vegas with some stand in shows that they don't take the fans and themselves seriously anymore. From  icons to charicatures.
And here I thought they stopped touring because of Bono’s activism and/or lack of vocal practice for so many years.  I suspect they booked this HUGE money residency before the realization Larry wouldn’t be able to perform adequately.  Wife want to go, but I’d prefer to remember the awesome shows of the past, rather than have a recent memory of disappointment.
They should hire Dave Weckl as a stand-in, only to check his treshold of patience. No seriously...  the energy and "primitive" drumming of Mr Mullen is all the band needs.  Like Ringo he is shaping the band into what it is, and should for the sake of lojalty and band chemistry not be replaced
Bono 🙄
Don’t see a problem
U2 used to be one of my favorite bands but they have completely lost the plot and are running on fumes. And doing this pointless Vegas retro show without Larry Mullen Jr. is an insult to their already tarnished legacy.
The more I think about it. I feel like Larry is simply done. Least the touring. The timing feels odd to now get these issues fixed. Maybe it’s legit. But it feels like a test of sorts to see if he still wants to do this by next year. And if not. Then what do they do.
Funny this should come up today, I googled "when did Bono..." and it autofilled with "sell his soul?"
U2's drum parts aren't hard, so any reasonably competent drummer could fill in without anyone noticing unless they're on stage.  It's not like Mullen is like Bonham, with a style and feel that you can hear if it's missing.  Even so, U2 is those four individuals.  They're not a band made up of a revolving door of session players, so it is pretty weird.  I don't think that it will a difference in terms of drummer (it's quite likely the replacement will be better than Mullen anyway), but it won't feel right to go and see 3/4ths of U2 as U2, especially to long time fans who have emotional attachments to each of the members of the band.
The stones have been doing last show tours for 20 years with various replacements and they still sell out. I guess there's 2 meanings to selling out!
My first time hearing U2 was in 1983, with the album War. And it's that opening drum beat on Sunday Bloody Sunday that sets the whole tone for that record.
Larry Mullen Jr is IMO the most original drummer ever. He is the backbone. This is not U2 as far as I’m concerned. I agree this is a blunder. I just hope that Larry is ok and this isn’t something more serious.
I really have always disliked U2 , can’t listen to 1 song all the way through , the drums are probably the only thing I was ok with.
Larry also said he wanted time off. Bun E. Was replaced after 35 or so yrs as was Joey Kramer.
THe Zoo Station concert in Budapest, Hungary in 1992 was one of th e most memorable experiences of my life. I still keep the ticket in my wallet.
Surely they have enough money at this point? They could sell their catalogue if they need money.
Let me preface this by saying that I'm a U2 fan. Not as big of a fan as some, but, definitely a fan.  I am fine with U2 performing their residency in Las Vegas minus Larry Mullin Jr. Yes, it sucks that he's not able to participate. But, first and foremost, he has to focus on his health. Given that the residency is "this fall" and he's already ruled himself out...that tells me that his priorities are in the right place.  As far as U2 goes, this is the business side of things. And as the saying goes, the show must go on. It sounds like conversations about U2's participation have been taking place for a while...and, I wonder what the legal/financial ramifications would have been for them if they were to pull out.
i dont know man. walter becker died and steely dan is playing gigs. the show must go on.
Glad I caught U2 in 1983 at the NY Palladium. They only had 3 albums under their belt at the time but they were amazing. 40 years went by like nothing. Tempus fugit.
I saw U2 for the first time when I was 16 in 1983 at the Loreley Rockpalast Open Air high above the river Rhine. It was a weid line up with Joe Cocker, Stray Cats, Dave Edmunds, Steve Miller Band. But U2 stood out for me that day. Even this early material hit a nerve in me and I stayed a fan.  They always kept their certain style but came up with fresh and powerful songs at the same time. Doing this show without Larry Mullen is stupid and wrong. With one of the four missing it is not the same band. I can not immagine there is financial pressure on them. So WTF?
This reminds me of the Rolling Stones bass player replacement. Huge deal when you think of all the iconic bass lines of Bill Wyman. Darryl Jones is a phenomenal player too, and I know he's not a "member" of the Stones, but the remaining members are still the Rolling Stones. I'm sorry to say it (being a bass player myself), but the rhythm section of any band can be substituted for road work - that's the way a lot of the music business has treated them. It might not be fair, but probably less than half of the Stones fans cared. I'm going to guess that it will be similar with U2 fans regarding this replacement.
That's what drum machines are for, right? 🤣
Irritated Rick REMAINS the greatest part of the internet. :) <3
UTUBE
This is all following Bono's excellent book, Surrender. I saw them during the original Achtung Baby tour, great show.  Las Vegas isn't alluring enough to me, and without Larry? C'mon - not gonna happen.
They want to play live so bad they can't wait for LMJr to recover? They're really trying to sell this out?
Vegas...it's part of the arc. Next is "PUPPET SHOW and U2" then a jazz album.
If it was for the fans and not the money, they would tour so people could actually see them without spending thousands of dollars for airline tickets, hotels, and concert tickets!
The Rolling Stones
The MSG Sphere will have but one grand opening.  Who better to introduce the world to a venue that has been built from the ground up with the latest audio and video technology than a band that since the Zoo TV tour has been introducing the world to the latest in audio and video technology?  Rarely is there a match so perfectly made. It’s unfortunate that Larry’s surgery will prevent him from participating but that’s life.  It happens to all of us, even rockstars.   U2 is more than a band.  They are a business that employs hundreds of people like roadies who have been with them since the 80s.  When the band isn’t working, neither are they and in fact, haven’t been working since 2019 before the pandemic shut down the concert industry.  This residency is an opportunity to provide them with income while the band completes their next album and mounts the tour to support it.  Sure, the band will make a boatload of money but that’s the way the industry works.   At the end of the day, all of the disappointment being expressed is just a knee jerk reaction that will be forgotten when the tickets go on sale.  Why would you deny yourself of what is guaranteed to be a memorable concert experience over something that  was unavoidable and doesn’t effect you personally?
Well..........BULLET THE BLUE SKY!!!!
I used to be a huge U2 fan, but it ended with Rattle and Hum. Wow, that was bad. Achtung Baby was a great comeback, though, and saw them again on that tour.
I was assuming there were some sort of contractual obligations that they couldn’t get around.
I am unsure what is going on with Larry Mullin however, I can't imagine that this was not a progressive discussion between them. I can say this however, I do have some inside information concerning the Sphere here in Vegas and I am thinking it has some correlation. This project has been ongoing for a few years now and MSG has dumped a country of money into it. Tons of problems and one area has been in marketing & promotion. Deals have been locked in for years,literally . Again, unsure with Larry and his surgery but, I am wondering if there would have been a breach of contract somewhere. We knew here in Vegas 3 years ago U2 was going to have a residency at the Sphere so if U2 already agreed before Larry's surgery....dunno
Just like The Vapors turned Japanese, U2 turned American and are keeping the Money Machine rolling. When is your rant on the Stones and their corporate engine?
If he'll never play again & they want to carry on, it makes sense. People are replaced all the time & most people never care who is playing drums. Queen had the best vocalist on the planet & they're still doing it. If you can replace Freddie, you can certainly replace Larry. End of story.
Always appreciate your expert insiders well seasoned opinion, but has any asked Mullen’s opinion.  I hear he gave his blessing. And I hope I can make it to Vegas to see them. Having seen them twice in stadiums, 17000 fans might seem intimate 😂. I’m betting it’s going to be a great show.
Shame Bono,  Edge and  Clayton !!!
I grew up with U2. I'm a HUGE fan. I've had moments where I was less of a fan than more, but their major win for me was Joshua Tree. Anyway, when I started to learn (teach myself) the drums, LMJ was my main influence. I learned at his knee, as it were. So, this news is heartbreaking. He's one of my favorite drummers of all time and that's like big news. My top five, Ginger Baker, LMJ, Danny Cary, Stewart Copeland, Jeff Porcaro.  So, this, for me, is a terrifying and sad thing. There's no LMJ, there's no U2.  This isn't megadeth...
Yeah U2's residency is... comical and pathetic.
They went Sjw anyway so FOOK u2
$12 ticket at UIC in '85. Was amazing. Was.
As for me, I stopped listening to U2 after Rattle And Hum. That's when Bono went ballistic with his pro-this, pro-that, and that was for me over the line. So whatever they did after R&H, I don't care, unfortunately.
How long to sing this song? Home long? How long? How long? It seems too ble*din long! Get off the fe*king stage lads. Are yiz for f**kin real? Your time is up. Jaysus... Fair play te ya, Rick. This was a worth while rant.
I never knew Rattle and Hum was considered a mis-step?  That is when i was introduced to the band.  What was the reason for the negativity for that album?
U2 can do anything they want in my opinion. I’d pay to see Adam Clayton do a solo tour of Linda Ronstadt hits. It doesn’t matter. After the Joshua Tree gig in Philly in 1987 at JFK stadium, they can do whatever the heck they feel like doing. They can play oom-pa polkas for all I care. They did their job.
I don’t see what the big deal is. Why would they prevent themselves from playing live if the drummer can’t/won’t? If it was the edge or bono, then I wouldn’t understand….
Hey Rick something to keep in mind.  The MSG Sphear gig is the gig to open the joint.  Its a HUGE HUGE HUGE deal. Like 3 bands on the road today could be the openers there to make noise.  U2, Stones, maybe Garth?
Hilarious.  I believe people can still do whatever they want. What's it to you? I think Larry Mullens opinion is the one that counts here.
There are so many people they bring on the road\Technicians, etc... those guys might be needing a job and this is hopefully why they are doing this, to give these people work. I had roadie friend that said when they do shows unemployment in Ireland goes down lol. I am sure that was just a joke but... anyway Larry is a huge part of what they do I just hope its to help their crew out.
I know the situation is different, but wouldn't it be like Rush moving on as Rush without Neil Peart???
Just a stop down the line
I have "erased" that record 100 times it still there, PLUS is THE WORST u2 music ever
Didn't Frank Sinatra describe them dressed like vagrants once when they were in an audience in his Vegas show...?
U2 has been living on the dark side for decades now.  Sad to see. Bono palling around with George W. Bush, Bill Gates, and all the rich and powerful, should have been the tip-off for people.  And Mullen, the lone Catholic in the group, and the most politically conservative, probably has had enough.   As Mullen said a couple of months ago, "I am autonomous and I value my autonomy. I don't sing from the same hymn sheet," Mullen said in a recent Washington Post interview, surrounding U2's upcoming Kennedy Center Honors. "I don't pray to the same version of God. So everyone has their limits."  On top of this, Mullen is taking time out to get his body back in order after suffering all the deterioration and damage that comes from playing drums passionately for 50 years.   So, a residency in Las Vegas (of all places) right now (when Mullen is working on his health) is the bridge too far for Mullen.  Good for him.    And, the hell with U2.  Really.
From 'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb' an on it's clear to me that U2 kept on going just to keep the money machine rolling.
Nope
Being Dutch, I am proud that a fellow Dutchy get'st to play with U2, and he is a big fan of the band and an excellent drummer. But I understand your point.. Let's wait & see...
Pretty sure it's just a "Contractual Obligation" made before they knew Larry would be out
Huge U2 fan - maybe the other three just want to play. Not tour but just play. Larry can't - it sucks but what are you gonna do? Everybody is doing a Vegas residency. Sting's Vegas show was incredible. This is nowhere as near of a mistake that the Itunes debacle was. Ease up.
Personally had enough of U2. Bono is unbearable, those glasses, hanging out in Davos and his bromance with Bush. Then there is U2's use of tax havens. And now Vegas. Ick. Need to take a shower. Guess I keep a couple of their records, but at a certain point the music isn't enough.
U2 is my favorite band but I’m ok with the decision. Lots of bands do this. Ironically the band used Adam Clayton’s bass tech during the original Zoo TV tour because he was too drunk to play and then had some stints in rehab. One of the times was the night before they recorded the live at Sydney gig. They have always been a democracy. So I’m pretty sure if they are playing then Larry gave his consent. I would love to see all of them playing but I’m just happy they still have the desire to play.
Las Vegas is where performers go to die.  Good riddance, the last full good album that they put out was War.  ZZ Top replaced Dusty Hill(RIP). That band was the same lineup for what? 50 years?
This happened with Black Sabbath when the guys (Sharon Osbourne) didn't invite the legendary Bill Ward on the final tour OR to even perform on their final album, 13. Also, when Page and Plant reformed in 1994 and toured together until 1998, JPJ's wasn't invited. This happens A LOT with legendary bands unfortunately.
They sold out a LONG TIME AGO. This Vegas run only proves it. Anything for a buck...sorry Rick...
This is a dumb take if the band wants to play and the drummer can't physically do the show then you get a different drummer duh.. telling bands they shouldn't play because one member can't make it really that's president you want to set. I know you have this really successful band that you've put a ton of work into but hey your drummer is sick so you three guys don't ever get to play again. The list of bands that have gone on without major members is countless. Journey, ac/dc, lynyrd skynyrd, etc. I don't even understand how something this boneheaded came out of Rick's mouth..
Three words, The Rolling Stones
Rick, given your status and popularity maybe you can talk them out of it
You're spot on Rick. U2 without Larry is just not U2. Perhaps the health issues are worse than they are letting on. Perhaps Larry can't play any longer. PACK IT IN OUT OF RESPECT. How much more money do you guys need? I think this is an appalling decision. I love Achtung Baby and would have flown across the country to see a few of the shows in Vegas. Not any more. If they do go through with this I wouldn't catch another U2 show ever. And I've seen them over 40 times, starting in 1982. It's called respect. R.E.S.P. E.C.T.  This band has played together since teenagers. There HAS to be more to the story. Are they contractually locked in to do this residency? Break the contract. Surely there's been insurance the band took out. And surely the band can afford to get out of the contract. This angers me so.  There isn't a U2 album I would rather see a "review" of than Achtung Baby. But without Larry? Are you guys out of your mind? (They've gone downhill since Paul McGuinness retired).
That manager pushed for them to do it cause HE wanted the money. Typical music "business" evil move. The worst word after music, is "business".👹
Hey Larry, we’re doing this gig WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.
The biggest problem with this is that they will get a drummer far more technically proficient to fill in rather than the self taught unique style of Larry. That's a compliment to Larry by the way.
Completely normal.  There are bands out with between zero and one original member, and people still line up to see them.  I may be the odd man out here, but I don't like U2 anyway.
Agreed. Nothing sadder than watching old farts on stage trying to recapture their youth.
As someone who grew up with them from the time I was 10 yrs old  (1983),  This is absolutely horrible. I admit I got bored with their albums and especially Bono's pontificating from upon high about practically everything after around 2006, BUT, They always earned my respect for acting as a BAND. Not elevating individuals any more than they had to, Their entire existence. They've talked many times about being very hesitant or outright rejecting offers or circumstances to perform or participate in any band functions without ALL members present. Of course they've amended that over the decades in certain areas, But they stuck together and leaned on one another and rarely wavered for almost 47 years. I understand they want to stay relevant while they have the opportunity to, And keep their brand or vision for themselves out in the public eye. No one earns much anymore nor garners much attention anymore as far as legitimate musical acts, So I'm sure they want to get out there and pun intended, Drum up attention and make some cash while at it. Fine. But this to me just shows how far a band can fall, Whatever the reason over time, From their original vision, And heritage they helped create. As a former professional musician, I always respected and appreciated that they insist upon always elevating Adam and Larry as integral members, As equals. Now sadly, It looks to me like money and the slivers left of adulation left for them are the above all. I will never view or hear them the same way again.
REM had to replace Bill Berry but managed to continue......Hard to imagine U2 without Larry though I agree.
I wonder if its got something to do with Bono's insane globalist propaganda views as Larry was always the least political of the band.
Nonsense Rick. Are you the global conscience of music now? Don't let your succes get into your head. Of course you can replace certain musicians. The Stones for example replaced Charlie Watts after 60 years, and they are doing well.
Dear Rick, I know what you mean. However...... the replacement drummer is called Bram van den Berg. Not "some drummer". I have played with him in music school. He is an absolute animal. U2 doesn't pick just anyone. I understand the sentiment, but maybe give the kid a chance instead of calling him "some guy". He's a Pro. Anyway, keep the video's coming. I enjoy them everytime. With love from Holland.
So Queen touring with Adam Lambert is a travesty? Blink continuing on without Tom was amoral? Dio replacing Ozzy? Tons of band want to keep going. Maybe Larry Mullin Jr. was fine with them keeping their promises to their fans. Some might not like it but some other are fine as long as U2 is playing a live concert. Gatekeeping is a plague. As long as everyone in the band/off the band/going to the show is informed and fine with it the more power to them!
I offered to drum for them, but they wanted someone who could drum.
If Larry is okay with it (which I'm guessing he is), it's not like he's being replaced IN THE BAND. The Stones had to go on tour without Charlie, even the Beatles replaced Ringo for a few shows in Australia back in the day.
wow.....i dont think ive ever seen such a heartless and selfish commentary from this channel. i think its ok to keep playing if they want to, especially if they have Larrys blessing. we only have so many years left to us, if they want to continue, let them. and this isnt some fake band with only the bass player left as an original member. they didnt fire the guy, he is unable to play. i am a moderate U2 fan that has never had the opportunity to see them live. i dont think its the end of the world if i get to see most of them, eventually. its a pity this annoys you so much that you must condemn the whole idea, without having seen them actually play with the new drummer
Luckily most people can only name Bono and the Edge.
good talking points!
disagree with you here, rick. would you rather have seen Queen split in the late seventies?
It’s funny you mention fans who started with “Achtung Baby”. I remember seeing U2 on the “Zooropa” tour (Rosemont Horizon with Pixies opening) and hearing a conversation going on behind me before the show where someone said, “Achtung Baby was a great debut album.” My tongue is still sore from biting it that day.
This video looks SOOOO nice, what's your main cam Rick?
Maybe Larry still gets his cut; gets to kickback and watch the new season of Yellowstone while the checks roll in.
I remember hearing about the Super Bowl commercial, and my mind went immediately back to the iPhone fiasco.  That being said, it's a Vegas residency and people will go to the show on a whim - they won't necessarily travel to Vegas just to see U2.
You're making assumptions about the reasons behind the decision Rick. Maybe there's more to it.
Saw them twice on the Zoo TV tour. No Larry? Not for me either.
Yep, he's a U2 fan alright. Don't think I've seen Rick so angry. At least they didn't retire "forever" like Motley Crue, then just come back for another tour, because they felt like it, then when Mick's health/age says "enough" they continue with a new guitarist!
You said it all so well Rick. I’m an irish life long fan and I think it. Sucks big big time. And as for the rehashed garbage the are putting out next month.
U2 aren't a band so much as a business conglomerate and source of income at this point. Managers, roadies, marketing teams, not to mention the bank accounts of the band themselves. There are a lot of mouths to feed and touring is the way they do it. Why else would Tool tour almost non-stop for 15 years between albums, even when Maynard wanted to be anywhere else. Same reason the Eagles have replaced numerous members of the band (including founder/singer/songwriter Glen Fry) over the years and continue to tour. This is the music business these days.
It's like driving a car with one wheel missing and its engine firing only three out of four cylinders... Not good at all.
Totally agree RB. Not only does this seem like a cash grab, it feels like a betrayal. I’ve been a fan since 1984. But I think it’s time for this faux U2 to Surrender before they become a parody of true U2.
Well said Rick, this needed to be said. U2 are undoubtedly one of the greatest live bands ever, but without Larry? Come on lads, behave.
I couldn't care less about U2.
+1
I’d not see U2 without Larry. And U2 has been my band since I first heard them in 1981.
They probably can afford a risk like this (I mean, they coughed up $3.5m for their ad). Residency in Vegas, maybe LM Jr. will arrive later??
i m witch you Rick!
It's like Def Leppard without Rick Allen, it's not Def Leppard.
It is going to happen Rick. What if they already had this planned, payed out all the money, then their drummer had a medical problem and told them to go ahead with it? Would that change your mind. We cannot know these things, if they haven't shared it.
Man do you know those videos about demonetising and the big bad music industry complaints?  Could you consider a view that you are becoming that yourself in a new coat called youtube? I mean these guys are not cardboard cutouts, or a CD cover, they have a life, stories, and with age likely challenges......and chosen to do a gig (that they do not need to do). What is your problem man? Are they not doing exactly what YOU want them to do? WTF? Do you really know why....or chosen to post these assumptions to get likes? Come on....I thought you can do better than this. Ou je, lets give a 'manager the fault". I am sorry this is the most stupid video on your channel so far.
The timing is absurd. Unless Mullen needed loads of time to rehab, you wait it out. Talk about tarnishing your brand. I'm guessing that like many of us drummers, he's got a herniated disc or other back issues. Since the gig is stationary and there is no travel involved, he could rehab enough to do those shows without much more delay. The only acceptable excuse is if he is done with the band permanently.
U2 found  what they were looking for. MONEY, MONEY
Saw them Brisbane Australia 2019 Joshua Tree tour and IMO Bono was done then.
Only makes sense if they made a commitment and then Larry became unavailable for health/personal reason hence a substitute to fill in, but U2 certainly has power to reschedule to allow Larry to participate. I hate to bring it up but I recall there was some bio of U2 that came out with some negative take on bono's relationship towards Larry, but I never read it and have no real insight to imply anything. Maybe this is something more like REM with their original drummer, he stopped playing for personal health issues I think, most U2 fans I know would have a hard time being enthusiastic about a U2 without Larry
I am a drummer and I appreciate your support and respect for how important the role of and the person drumming is!
I agree with all of the comments. Larry is an intricate part of the U2 brand, it's sound and identity.  However, it is still show BUSINESS and there's a side of me that says that Larry will certainly collect on this business. He is 1/4 of U2.   If his health cannot sustain performing every night or every other night - his health must come first. But I can't imagine the rest of the guys saying "sucks for you Larry" and performing without compensating him.  I'm also sure Larry doesn't want be the reason why U2 is no longer performing either. Through all of the adversities bands face - to your point Rick - they've survived 45 years! Maybe this is just the guys saying "we got this" - don't worry about it and get better. There will be other shows. In the meantime - here's your 25% of a gazillion dollars. 😎
Completely disagree. Fans think they "own" the band. The band decides fot themselfs what to do. So if these concerts are succesfull, who is someone else to tell them they are wrong. Plenty of examples of bands that changed members and were just as succesfull, maybe even more. The band makes the decisions, it is their band, not anyone else.
The Stones continued without Brian Jones, Mick Taylor, Bill Wyman, and now Charlie Watts…Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers continued without Ron Blair, Stan Lynch, Howie Epstein…Van Halen continued without DLR,…Journey and Santana continued without…pretty much everyone!  The list goes on and on. Arguably, great stuff happened in each band as they evolved. Sometimes line-ups changed amicably, sometimes in anger, sometimes for ego and money, sometimes in illness/death, sometimes in addiction, sometimes in burnout, sometimes to save off-stage relationships — lots of reasons.  Is Larry obligated to always want to do/play/live as his HS friends always want to, even in his 60’s?  If Larry has chosen not to proceed and the other guys want to do it, and all are okay with that,  why not live and let live without judgement?  Music benefits from harmony more than dissonance. If Larry is harmonious with the guys, who are we to create dissonance?  I hope it sparks new energy. Respect the individuals,  expect nothing; and accept what’s offered and what’s to come — just might be better than ever!
What if the new drummer is even better than grandpa Mullen (not so) jr. (anymore)?
I suspect Larry actually retired
ZZ Top is playing without Dusty.  Life goes on.
The MSG Sphere asked U2 to enter but Larry could only crawl...... Bono couldn't keep holding on to what Larry got when all he got is hurt
Playing in Vegas reaks already of selling out TBH Larry be damned!  🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
I am a longtime U2 fan (since Joshua Tree), but playing devil's advocate here: Bands change members ALL THE TIME. What makes U2 different? My favorite band, The Cure, has had members come and go almost constantly. Seems rather presumptive to think that the new/temp drummer won't be any good.
When they shoved that free album in my Itunes I was so outraged I quit all Apple products!
U2 is at once great and self-aggrandizing. I've lost count on how many times they jumped the shark, starting with "Rattle and Hum," which borders on American cultural appropriation throughout.
While I agree with most of Rick's criticism, labeling the drummer  "some fill in drummer" is a bit harsh on Bram van den Berg. He is a drummer from Dutch band Krezip and liked quite a bit there. Sure the band's reputation isn't that big compared to U2, but a bit more credit to the bloke would have been nice.
At first glance, I thought the rant was about the fact they were playing Las Vegas.
It's their life, their careers and their choice. Maybe Larry doesn't want to be in Las Vegas, if the other 3 do, and Larry gives his blessing, why should I object? Let's be real, how many bands were together with no changes for that amount of time? If this is temporary or not, as long as it's their choice, is fine by me. I love U2, I've been a fan of them since 1996, when I was 14 years old. And, unlike other bands I also love, they are the most consistent thing out there. To criticize them because after more than 40 years as being a band, they decide to change something is overreacting imho. Not even to mention to tell them to stop being a band or doing music. That's insane. Let them do, what they want to do.  Plus, I don't see people telling Depeche Mode to quit because Andrew Fletcher died, or even criticize them for releasing a new album and tour without one of their founding members. Life goes on, didn't know Larry is not well, and I wish all the best for him and hope he will be back with U2 soon, but if this is a case similar to R.E.M., where a member left fue to health reasons and the rest decided to go on, why should anybody have a say about it?
LMJ is the cornerstone, the rock, essential. Putting in a sub is like having fake pasta in your signature lasagna and hoping nobody notices. But hey whatever, it's not like I can afford to go anyway.
Non-musicians have no idea how important the drummer is to the recorded sound of many bands. Led Zep quit forever after Bonham died. Smashing Pumpkins were the top band in the world when their drummer went to jail, and they released an album using electronic drums which tanked. G&R could never recreate the swingy-ness of their original drummer. Who cares about the Who as a recording band since Keith Moon died?   For live concerts/tours, stuff happens. Beatles toured Australia with jimmy Nicol when Ringo was sick. The Stones trundle on without Charlie (and Bill, and Mick Taylor, and BJ). Spinal Tap the same. I assume Dave Grohl is competent to hire another drummer for gigs, while playing on recordings. A Vegas residency is a pure money grab, and only 1% of paying customers are gonna care who's behind the drum kit.
I’ve had tremendous respect for U2 over the years I saw them in Sunderland on their first English tour 1979. 1980, something like that, after all these years, it should be all or nothing Led Zeppelin couldn’t go on without their drummer The Who tried, but never really came up with the goods, and now you have The Rolling Stones without Charley, Watts, they shouldn’t be playing somebody should be saying call it a day
I am with you Rick! That would be like the rolling Stones going out without Keith! Or Zeppelin going without Jimmy Page! Total sacrilege! He is one of the most original rock drummers! This is why I subscribe Rick!
Maybe they have the... DESIIIIIRE...  for it
Good on ya, Rick!  And I wholeheartedly agree with you!  They could've always postponed those gigs until Larry was feeling better again!  Which hopefully he soon will, too.
Relax, for some people it will still be an enjoyable show.  Injuries happen.  People are acting as if Bono was being replaced by Squiggy.
Not very progressive really... They're "Running to stand still"  🤔😜
I used to like U2...I lost all respect for Bono when he started promoting Globalism and the corrupt leaders of the UN. Total sell-out. It didn't help that they stopped making quality music around the same time...haven't listened to them in years. No loss!
Never liked U2 …
If they replace Larry with Gavin harrison, it would be worth seeing. I don't think Pineapple Thief would let him go!
What about the Stones without Charlie Watts FUBAR!
Some people think "Rattle and Hum" was a big misstep??? WHY??? That was my FAVORITE U2 album!
It's hard to believe U2 are gonna do gigs without Larry!...So yer tellin' me there's a chance - Drummer
Who cares, U2 are a joke band?
I’ve got no issues with the decision. They are musicians who want to play their catalogue. The show must go on.
Spot On Rick.  My favorite band. Seen them 19 times since 1992..,Don’t forget the resounding success of Passengers…  Larry’s style is so unique, can’t see how it sounds right without him.
No Larry, no U2.  And why "Achtung Baby"? "Joshua Tree" is a better album beginning to end.
I’m a longtime fan (since 1981 and “Boy”) who is of two minds on this question: 1) U2 are a BAND. The band is greater than the sum of their parts. Each member is essential for U2. When they stray from that cohesiveness, the result is “Pop” or “No Line on the Horizon”, both of which I consider sub-par records. They were able to pull it back each time, but why go there again? 2) U2 are a live band at their core. They were the first concert I saw ( Hartford Civic Center 1987) where the crowd were singing the songs as loudly as the band. They don’t perform as much as they connect. They are getting older and Larry has paid a high price physically to tour. If he can no longer do it and he is supportive, I can understand why the other members want to proceed.  I’ve heard people talk of this being a cash grab ( and there is a Big pile of money on the table) but I’m seeing it as people who are still able to do what they do at a high level and not wanting to stop (see Tom Brady). God bless the boys.
I guess I won't be going to see U2 any time soon much like I am never going to see Cheap Trick live because they replaced Bun E. Carlos with Rick's son. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Absolutely agreed!
RICK, we're living in a time where a man broke up a band that he didn't form, made statements that indirectly lead to the murder of one of the founding members of that band, and then the other founding member of that band, who is also the brother of the formally mentioned slain member, stated the band would NEVER reunite, and after the remaining founding member passed away, the aforementioned man that broke up the band, is currently touring under the name that he didn't create.  A band playing without the originally drummer because he can't keep up is not a reason that is going to stop anyone.   The other band is Pantera in case you didn't know.
Been a fan since Boy, this is ridiculous, but who am i
U2😴
You’re all going to hate me but i never really got to like U2. Yes they have some good songs but all in all it’s not for me.
U2 is over.  They should just break up.  My theory is that Larry wanted to quit permanently but it was going to cost the band a bunch of money because they'd already signed on to open the Sphere.  So this is a fig leaf, but we'll never see all 4 members of U2 on the same stage again.
I love how your voice gradually rises to a crescendo! Great rant.
Instead of paying all that money for an ad about a gig to make money, maybe they should just sit in their tiny mansions and write a song about greed.
Yeah they must have contractual obligations with this music behemoth sphere thingie. Well, at least he is not dead, like the Who's drummer Keith Moon. That concert with PJ you saw must have been great. My 2 fave rock bands together. 2005 U2 show I saw was the best ever. Lots of chatter among the U2 fans about this Larry absence and is it worth going to this Vegas experience.
This is kinda ridiculous. If the band has sat down and agreed together that the show should go  on, (just 12 shows by the way - NOT a tour) and Larry takes the time to recover from surgery and be back stronger to make new music and then go on an actual tour. Than so be it. I would guess that all these commenters here, could go to a show blindfolded for 5 songs and have no clue that it isn't Larry on drums. They are the perfect band to open this insane arena. If you are the first it's an honor and U2 deserve. Larry knows it, reasonable long time fans like myself know it. The band is in their 60's. probably got 1 maaaayyybee 2 albums/tours left. Larry can't play to record new material anyway right now. Are they gonna sit out another year? It's been almost 4 years off the road already. Time is their enemy right now. Let them do what THEY want to do. If you don't want to go see a once in a lifetime show of your favorite band, honoring your favorite album, then don't go. Have fun staying home on your high horse.
This has obviously been the works for years, I'm guessing this show was always meant to be the first show at the Sphere when it opened but it's opening was delayed by Covid. I'm also willing to bet that it's opening would have originally coincided with the 30th anniversary of Achtung Baby, which is why they chose that album to perform.   There's probably a ton of money tied up in this and a huge financial loss for both the band and the venue if the show doesn't go on as planned. So though it sucks that Larry won't be there (obviously the rest of the band want him there), the financial loss from outraged fans is less than if the show doesn't happen at all. Also, you can't predict medical issues, it's just really bad timing.
Might as well see their tribute band......
He almost left on achtung baby. He hates the change on the sound of the band.
They actually played a gig in Sydney with one of the guitar techs filling in for Adam Clayton, who was under the weather. So it has happened before.
Just a money grab
Following in the footsteps of their idol, Liberace, and bringing the lounge act to Las Vegas.
It's a musical journey
The last song that they made that I liked was Gloria
None of those drums you mentioned were what he wanted.  He hated it.
U2 has a new manager? It’s not Guy Oseary anymore? Hope that’s true, lol. I think Larry will be back after he recovers, and I don’t think the band is done creatively. I actually liked the commercial.
One more band to your list: Rush 1974-2020. At least in their case, they stayed true to themselves and I find it inconceivable that they would ever do another "Rush" show without Peart.
So I grew up listening to Achtung Baby and Joshua Tree because of my dad and that's how I became a U2 fan. Sincerely I would go to Las Vegas just to see U2 playing Achtung Baby in full and a few more hits if I had the money for it, even with a drummer replacing Larry Mullen Jr (who I thought was going to retire, but he just had surgery and is still recovering), 'cause it's THE BEST U2 RECORD, they haven't released anything better than Achtung Baby since then, if the concert is like the ZooTV Tour it would be even better than the real thing.
I would say as a big big fan. That was such a disappointment to me. Real fans wouldn't matter to wait for Larry. My guess is that there is more behind the scenes.
The Joshua Tree Tour was immensely successful.  That was the last U2 show that I've been to.  I suspect that they figure that doing another album tour is the right move, in this case Achtung Baby!  I'm sure they got the blessing from LMJr., so it's all good.  The other thing too is that, that venue needs to hit the ground sprinting because it's still under construction and its project budget is out the dome roof (pun intended), and the investors have already planned a 2nd dome in England, so it needs to make a splash, so U2 was the obvious choice.
Vet stadium!  I was at all those shows! :)  Can't believe they're doing this, but even more, i don't know why the hell Larry hasn't had the surgery done yet.  Bono has had heart surgery, back surgery, etc.   I guess there's something about this Sphere location that they can't pass up.  These guys are way too big to blame a manager. . . .  they don't do anything w/out wanting to.    I think they will feel the hurt on this - same with this 'new' album - why ruin the catalogue with adult contemporary versions of their best songs??  That would be a good video for you - you reacting to those songs . . . so far they've put 3 out, and as a huge fan, i'm bummed . . . .
Eh. I think this is an over-reaction. Larry Mullen Jr is stepping back for medical issues. The forthcoming record is just a greatest hits volume 3 type of thing. They wanna play to audiences. They're old. If they were putting out brand new material it might be different.
Turns out what the US shoot down last week wasn't a Chinese spy balloon, it's was Bono's humongous head and ego!
Yes, thank you so much of this! i am a huge U2 fan and feel totally betrayed by this. Thank you!
LOL don't know if you've been working on doing an interview with Bono or not but you can probably go and work on something else now. I'm with you 100% Rick!
I get what you are coming from, but this is gonna be a massive gig for a monumental album, and they wouldn't do it without Larry being OK with it. Plus, it's temporary. He just has a few health problems he needs to get sorted out. No one is undermining Larry's contribution to U2. They've said multiple times that Larry is the leader of U2. If Larry's not OK with it, it wouldn't be happening.  Also, why tf are you bringing up the Apple thing again. We get it. They executed an idea poorly, but the album wasn't bad, and people were too stupid to know how to remove it. No need to still be butthurt after 9 years. People have been mad at U2 for many different reasons over their 47-year career, but they are still relevant for a reason.  Bottom line. It's a temporary replacement for a residency that Larry is 100% in support of. If you're that upset, just don't go to the concert. There is no need to be angry over it, especially since you are a fan.
Sorry, Bono is a pud.   Soon as his stupid ass was mingling with the elite any Album I had went in the trash.   Same thing for several other bands I refuse to listen to. "FU I will do what you tell me"
I can definitely understand that it's hard not to be able to perform when it's a passion. But I think definitely replacing a band member or replacing it for a certain period of time is always a risk. And with bands like U2 the question comes to me even if it is sad, when do you stop? If it's only for this or a few more concerts, I think that's completely fine. But in the long run, of course, you have to think about how you want to live without a part of your body and sound.
Being a huge U2 fan I can understand why this could anger fans, but , and this is coming from someone who's never experienced the band live outside of TV or youtube, I personally don't see it as a bad thing as long as their drummer is ok with it , true your sans one of the key components of the band , but this could also give them a new perspective as a band and as long as he in the mix when they put out their  next album,l don't see a problem with it,I got a kick out of seeing Chris Martin of Coldplay front for Bono when he could not perform once as long as its not a permanent replacement I'll be interesting to hear how someone else changes the dynamics of the band, also unlike many bands U2 have demonstrated that they still have a lot of milage in this long and winding musical road they been traveling to still deserve a place on it...true they're not at  100 percent but even a U2 at 80 percent is more formidable in comparison to many newer or older bands.
U2 = Overrated
Since you brought up the Beatles, I'm sure you probably know alot about them, so I'm sure you're familiar with the story about how a guy named Jimmie Nicol filled in for Ringo for 8 concerts on one of their tours, because Ringo had to undergo tonsillitis. It's not like the guy permanently replaced Ringo and in U2's case they aren't permanently replacing Larry Mullen Jr either.
if Larry can't play with the band, it's a missed opportunity for Bono and The Edge to make the residency into a more intimate set of guitar-vocal shows, which outside promotions they've never done.
Not only is Larry sitting it out a bad move, it's flat out insane they're directly going to compete against ZooTV. That's a legendary tour, and inviting comparisons to it (subtracting the B-stage stuff, the Zooropa stuff, and the other material used to flesh it out...not to mention the constumes and set design) is so incredibly boneheaded. It's the only concert tour I know of that, itself, is a work of art with a thesis, theme, and tone.
Agreed. With all you said.
It warmamy heart that there are still people out there that resent having unwanted product rammed down their throats. :D
Can't see why this is such a big deal. My favorite bands from the 90s lost their singers and still persist. People come and go, people are unavailable, people have medical issues, people lose interest. They didn't kick him out of the band they just want to play some shows.
My favorite song off achtung baby was love is blind. Haunting and original and I couldn't stop listening to it
It can get even weirder: the band Yes is coming to The Netherlands with only one original band member, Steve Howe. The rest I've never heard of.
It's a harsh business to be in. Remember how Yes kicked Jon Anderson out when he was unwell, replacing him with a singer from a tribute band? Then that new singer's voice needed a rest and he got kicked out.
That idea wAs great for fans
So, what if U2 signed the contracts before the surgery, etc... was deemed to be required, and got stuck in the contract.  Do the shows or be out millions because of a surgery.  Sometimes you just have to roll with the punches.  U2 may be trying to make lemonade out of lemons.  They may not want to do this any more than you want them to.  Of course that's speculation.  Who you need to talk to is Larry Mullen Jr.
Have to agree with the other comments: Larry Mullen Jr is an absolutely crucial part of their sound. Right up there with Bono and the Edge. But then again, I'm a drummer. 😊
Totally agree.  Larry's unusual and original drumming is as big a part of the band as edges guitar playing.
Larry is sick of Bono.
More over: they hired a Dutch drummer from a band that had 1 popular song in the ninetees; not a rockband in any way..how they came up with him no idea. Perhaps because U2 keeps their holdings in Holland for tax reasons..Well good luck in Vegas anyway!
The music sucks now and Bono is insufferable.
Man, you rock !
Surprised you didn't mention Led Zeppelin. Lost a member, band is over. Doing a few reunion shows with Jason is ok.
The big assumption is that Mullen can drum the way he did in 1991.  Its 32 years later. Maybe Larry can't or doesn't want to, and this singling of him out will actually make things more awkward for him, instead of a nice show of support. Neil Peart was having challenges beyond his cancer that likely would have limited him, just as Alex Lifeson on guitar wasn't going to be able to continue touring even if Neil hadn't passed. Age happens. And for a drummer, the physical aspect leaves them even more vulnerable. No one ever thought Rush could continue without Neil and would never be Rush again, but I guarantee if they announced a tour with Mike Portnoy or a Bill Bruford type, people would go. I would.
I cannot disagree with one sentence of your rant. I was born in 1969. My entire music experience as an adult follows U2. This may be a mistake. Unfortunately tickets are still going to cost $300 a show in Vegas.
Maybe they are contractually obligated to do it? Maybe Larry doesn't care?
if Larry Mullin has heath issues that prevents him to do his job with U2 I don't see why the band could't tour with a replacement. and then he returns when he is well
This is kinda silly. I love Larry as much as anyone. But there is no world where 3/4 of U2 isn’t better than no U2.
Great rant, Rick! The whole Vegas thing is a joke anyway! How much money do they need? U2 needs someone like Pete Townsend who refused for the olngest time to go on a The Who reunion tour because, "I don't want to waste my time helping Roger and John pay off the castles they bought." Brilliant!😂
Why are you judging without knowing their side of the story...maybe there is something that you don't know...
What happened to the that one guitar at 5:06?
I think you are making a WAY too big of a deal here. They were asked to be FIRST band to open this wholly unique stadium with the most cutting edge video screen that is a full sphere and will have the worlds most advance sound system with a museum type exhibit in the halls. It’s NOT a residency, and Larry will be joining them when the show actually goes on tour. THEY ALL decided this opportunity was too great to give up, being the first to utilize this amazing venue (look it up if you don’t know what it is, it’s too amazing to get in to all the details here) so if they all want this to happen, I will be there. I got to see one of the Joshua Tree anniversary shows so it’s not like I need to check off a bucket list item, but I want to experience this venue ASAP and what a band to see christen it.
Has anyone thought about the possibility that they may have signed a contract or that these shows were planned for a long time already? There were talks for special Achtung Baby shows pre covid times and the construction of the MSG was set to finish in 2021, so most likely the band had planned to play these shows as usual with all 4 members of course. But then Covid happened and it all had to be delayed, and noone knew when life would become normal again. Time flew by and now this year Larry Mullen Jr. unfortunately has to have surgery and can't play, but of course they couldn't have known that when they planned the whole thing. Project management is not an easy thing. My guess is that these plans to play the "opener shows" for the MSG existed for years, and they didn't want to dip out now. Not just because of the concerts, but also because it has to be a huge thing for them to play inside of that sphere as the first band. Which is brand new technology. If they had planned a "normal" tour they would have most likely delayed it.
I guess this will be U3+1. Can't imagine what drummer they're gonna get to fill those shoes. Stu Copeland maybe? ;)  Oh wait, I know.... Ringo! :)
We don't know what Mullen's health status is, but he has hinted that surgery will keep him out for 2023.  In recent interviews he's indicated that he's not happy with how decisions are made in the band, leading me to believe that his heart isn't in it. I suspect that he parts ways sometime in the future.  I imagine the rest of the band sees it and wants earn some money. I'm a little puzzled by the choice of Achtung Baby as well.
I was a huge U2 fan starting the early 80's.  Favourite album is 'The Unforgettable Fire", followed by "October".  Love "Achtung Baby".  First time I ever flew in a plane I was listening to that album. I stopped being a U2 fan not long after Pop.  Their music lost that "punch" or whatever it was, it all started to sound the same.  Bob Dylan was the same, Dire Straits and even Pink Floyd to an extent. I agree with you on the Police, do what the band is going to do, them move on.  Its OK to move on. Not sure what happens to bands, but like comedians, age isn't a good fit in general.  Maybe its that "safe" option perhaps... Las Vegas is where you go to die as an artist.
They were my favorite band for a very long time. But in 2018 they publicly announced their support of Ireland's legalization of abortion. Like MANY other Christian fans of U2 (and we have always represented a large percentage of their fans), I stopped listening to them in 2018. I completely lost interest in the band.
Know , Comment Allez-vous ... 👻🌟 Child
I wonder how much Mullins gets paid to not be there. I wonderer if he'd think, "No, people, don't screw this up for me. Go see the show. I want the dump truck of money!"
Maybe the drummer is sick or has other things going on? They can't always do the same things as eachother
My impression is that Larry is ready to retire and the rest of the group is not. I can’t imagine the group going forward without Larry without his blessing.
Even at 75% they give a better concert than any other band. I will still go.
If they want to play they should be allowed to. Underneath the purist rants is fear of change and also aging. If the shoe was on the other foot and you wanted to go out and play and make some money most people would justify it to themselves. U2 had a lot of time to say what they wanted to say. I think a real fan would want them to be happy doing what makes them happy.
I don't think LArry Mullen wants to be resident in vegas. Thats what Cher and Tom Jones do and cando because they are not offensive to the blue haired crowd.
this seems pretty likely in a world where a band called YES  can exist without Jon Anderson.
You're a good guy, Rick. And I'm totally with you on this one.
What do you think about ZZ Top, Rick?
Most overrated band to ever exist, just so safe and sterile it's like department store music for boomers.
Let’s face it, AB was their last good record. They’ve sucked since then.
Go see them if your there but dont tell anyone what you did in Vegas
Wrong move. Period. Larry Mullen IS U2. The backbone of the musical engine.
Some bands should just know when it's time to retire.
I always remember going to see The Alarm in the early/mid 80s when they supported their good mates  U2 ,  the venue was rammed , The Alarm played a stormer , most of the crowd left after The Alarm played and headliners U2 played to an half empty venue , how times change .
Sounds to me like one or more people in the band just need or want more money.
It's U1.5
Biggest U2 fan here in the 80s and 90s. After that they lost me. As of very late I am really lost. Every move seems like a money grab and a desperate attempt to be relevant again.
If I colleague of mine calls in sick, you think my boss would say “ y’all stay at home too, cause it’s not the same if you’re not complete in the office?
I've been listening to this band since 1982 at 15 years old when I heard 'I Will Follow' in the movie 'Last American Virgin'.  Boy, October, War, Under a Blood Red Sky, The Unforgettable Fire......I was in college when the Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum  came out...and so on.  A lifetime soundtrack.    I LOVE this band!?!?      Rick, you're 100% correct:  U2 is Larry Mullen Jr, Adam Clayton, The Edge, Bono.
The MSG Sphere in Las Vegas is going to be the bust of all busts...already $100+m overbudget. No idea why U2 would want to be the guinea pig for the opening of this venue. No way the same without Larry. I would think they were locked into this residency contract before Larry's surgery came up.
Larry founded U2 , end of story
I think it was $7M for 30 second ad…   Fork it over suckers..
I lost interest in U2 after Bono died on the cross for the forgiveness of sin.....
So the commercial shows people from all around the world, but the residency is only in Las Vegas? How many people are going to or are able to travel to see them -1 one key member?
100% right Rick 👍
Sorry, but I don't get the rant. Larry can't play now. This band has been together for ages. I'm pretty sure they talked about this and this is what they wanted to do.   A real U2 fan. Really? This TEMPORARY new drummer (he's only filling in) has already received a lot of hate mails from so called U2 fans. HATE MAILS!!!   You turn this into something much bigger than it really is. A real U2 fan would support the band in this decision, of which I'm sure it wasn't an easy one to make.   I thought it was a worse idea when Axl Rose replaced Brian Johnson for a whole tour.  Again, you make this much bigger than it really is.
I’m not sure what going on.  I’ve known about their residency for quite a while now, so I’m not sure if they had originally planned for all 4 to be a part of it and then something happened to Larry.  It’s not like this is some new thing.  I’m sure it’s been in the planning for years now.  I have no understanding of what’s happened behind the scenes, but I’d at least like to hope that the original idea was for all of them and then something happened to Larry to where he couldn’t make it.  If that’s at all possible then it’s not like they stabbed Larry in the back.  Sometimes when your locked into something, there aren’t much options when things go wrong.  Just an idea.  I could be 100 percent off base here
Spot on! It's not U2 without Larry. I'm a huge fan since Boy. I wouldn't go see this show.
Well, what does Larry think about it? Maybe he was all for it, and there will be a gig waiting on him when he recovers from his surgery. Or is there something else I don't know? The Beatles did a couple of weeks at the beginning of their 1964 tour with Jimmie Nicol standing in for Ringo... that may be a bit different, but just saying. It didn't hurt them any.
Hahahahaha THANk you. I legitimately thought that was an airwave hack when I saw that ridiculous POS that aired during the Super Bowl
He he, Pantera vibes XD
I believe Larry Mullen jr. said plenty of times he does not want to play anymore...
Would be like seeing RUSH without Neil.  WTF?  Nope... we can wait for Larry's recovery or just not see the band.
Spot on!
0:53 "My buddy Rich"...I did a double take
Right on point with this one.
I am pretty sure it is about a stupid 20 years contract they signed with Live Nation, but also they postponed that because of the pandemy and of course, a huuuuge ego of Bono and Edge. Last year Larry Mullen was straight to say he would not do this, the others he didn’t know, but he would take care of his health first instead of put his head down for a benevolent dictatorship in the band.
I don't see if it's a blunder if the guy needs medical treatment. Hopefully he will recover and join them later. The band probably had contractual obligations.
Love Ricks’s channel, particularly his rants, but I’m not getting why this is such a big issue. Larry Mullen is not available because of health reasons and, in the meantime, the rest of the band wants to get back to playing live. Presumably, when LM is better, he’ll join them, in the meantime, another drummer is filling in. What’s the big deal? I don’t get it…
Didn't the band this drummer is from open for U2 on their European tours? I think there is some connection there at least.
Really?  REALLY?!   LMFAO
I think you're missing another thing really wrong with this announcement... that Mr. Bono, Mr. human rights guy is getting in bed with MSG owner Larry Dolan to do a residency at the MSG Sphere at the Venetian Resort who uses facial recognition software at all his venues he owns and uses it to profile anyone MGS/Larry Dolan doesn't like to ban them from the venue. Another sell out down the drain!
Led Zeppelin without Bonham.
I'm not a fan of U2, but I will say "Mysterious Ways" is pretty awesome.
Saw them co-headline with The Alarm at the old Miller Time concerts at pier on NYC back in the early 80's.  Sad to see the blatant cash grab.  There's no U2 without LMJ.
I discovered U2 in 2021. It got me to start playing guitar. Achtung Baby is my favorite album
U2 lost me after autchung baby. Saw them on the unforgettable fire tour, phenomenal! No big production just them playing their hearts out. It's all about trying to stay relevant in the one and done culture.  Bono needs to stay the hell out of AMERICAN POLITICAL ISSUES!!!!!!!
As a fan of U2, and a guitar player myself, I think of Larry 1st when I even THINK about the band. Edge and Bono are great, but I want to hear Adam and Larry locking up the groove before anything. Not a good move, sorry. Peace ☮️
This is where a band like Rush knew when to say when. When Neil said he was done because of his limbs not being able to play to his high standards anymore, as badly as Geddy and Alex felt like they still had plenty of gas left in the tank and still wanted to continue,, they knew without Neil on the stool, it would no longer be Rush and called a day. U2 is making a serious error of judgement here and it must be based on misplaced ego, because they sure as hell don't need the money!!
Normally agree with Rick 100%, but this is far from unprecedented. The Who did it after Keith Moon, for decades. People would have paid a fortune to see Zep with Jason instead of his father if they'd toured. People enjoyed seeing Sabbath even without Bill Ward. The most recent to do it are the Stones, and Charlie was their drummer approx 15 years before U2 even existed. This may be the last or only chance for people to see U2 and the vast majority won't even be able to see the stage from where they're sitting, let alone know its not the original drummer.
Exactly right. Greedy little bastards if you ask me....can't even wait for Larry.
they re lost
Yea, I would not pay to listen to a 3/4 of U2. I'd wait until they're all back at their designated stations. They are the best live band ever.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions!!!
Most overrated band in history.
They'll Wither Without him...
Yep. You’re entirely correct.
We don't know what's going on behind the scene. Larry has, at a couple different times, thought about giving it up. Bono usually has had to persuade him to not. I also recall that the "electronic" period of U2 (Achtung, Zoo, Pop [and Passengers]) were not Larry's favorite, as he had to play alongside a drum machine. This could very well be their way of keeping him a part of band in the long run, but not making him play Achtung in Vegas night after night. He is 61 you know, quite wealthy and has given his all to a band that he loves, but a band that has also occasionally overruled him in artistic direction. If you like the album and are in Vegas, I wouldn't let a (likely very capable) drummer stop you from going.
How serious is the neck and elbow surgery that Larry Mullen Jr. had?    Is it career ending?  The neck and elbow are important to a drummer.  If he can't play and people want to go, then it is fine.
I disagree whole heartedly. If it’s done with Larry’s blessing, why not? What kind of lesson are we teaching here? When things aren’t perfect, quit? This channel is so passionate about music I would think Rick would understand why the show must go on. Absolutely terrible energy saying younger generations aren’t in love with this album.
Who starts "Sunday Bloody Sunday?" Larry does! The first basement cover band I played in did an okay cover of that song. I'm not big on nostalgia, but it's kind of how I hear echoes of high school, and learning songs, rather than riffs, and hearing ourselves in a room, not sounding too bad. And that snare is Larry Mullen Jr.  Dumb idea. Lots people are doing it. But they should wait for Larry to recuperate and do a real tour.  They kind of have the gigantic show dialed in like no one else does, and their music has enough instances of lump-in-your-throat grandeur that stadiums and arenas make thematic and physical sense. Oh wait, will there be a buffet? Sunday Bloody Prime Rib? Bono may as well do the gig solo, to a BIG track, with a fleet of matching dancers, like a 21st century super bowl glitz-fest. Tacky move, U2.
I am just hearing about this from this video. Not sure how I feel, but I appreciate hearing your perspective Rick.  Achtung Baby is my favorite album of all time…started listening to them around 1995.
Not sure why it's apparently OK for the Stones to go on without their drummer, but not OK for U2.
Yeah it sucks he can’t be there but it’s only 12 shows. He’s not quitting the band and should be back in time for a new album release within the next year followed by a world tour.
Just courious Rick. I don’t remember you going this hard on Black Sabbath when bill ward wasn’t included on their tour.
Larry Mullen founded the band, its his band in essence. It would be like steve harris not playing with Iron Maiden
All Bono could care about seeing is more money. He’s a Sellout Globalist  Shill !!
@rickbeato what do you think of the new songs released from the Songs of Surrender album that us coming out in March?
Rick, Its a legit point you raise. However, are there extenuating circumstances? Is Larry's health not good? Are there other reasons? There just might be something else in there, in the story. Be good to know if there is. Cheers, Sam McNally Australia
the hubris. why not replace their lead singer?  It's not like Larry went all Syd Barrett. Such an insult.
I don’t see the problem. If U2 wants to play without Larry and there’s an audience who loves to see it, who are we to judge that?  Let them have a good time. If you don’t like it, just go somewhere else.  Normally I agree with your rants, but this one is a bit sad
Your frustration is understandable although it also reminds me a bit of the “bring back Ace and Peter” posse😅 in the end it’s their call and we’ll see how many tickets they sell, I wish my fellow Dutchman lots of luck and happiness filling those shoes🍀 😊✌️
Didn't realise that Buddy Rich was also a U2 fan...
Honestly, I like three of their older songs—Pride, New Years Day and Sunday Bloody Sunday. That’s it. Never been to a show, never bought an album and never understood the hype. Guess I’m weird. Joshua Tree did nothing for me. In fact the last half of the 80’s is a musical dead zone to me.
I bet you Larry will still get paid whether he is there or not, I am sure the casino paid for the ads and the rest of the band is not going to pass up a major paying gig. It does show how much they love to play as I am sure they all dont need the money
Can somebody please share the video where you criticize the Stones for continuing without Charlie?  I can't find the link.  I'm sure this residency has more to do with the uniqueness of the venue and being the first band to play there.  They simply couldn't wait for Larry to be better before opening.  I'm sure U2 will be back on the road with Larry as soon as he's better.
Well said. What and Idiotic idea!
It doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me.  Its not like they did this to slight him or that they tried to negotiate with him and failed (ala Bill Ward).  He is still in the band and will return after he recovers from surgery.  In the meantime, I am confident that as a shareholder in U2, Inc., he will make plenty of money from these shows even if he does not play.
I still cannot believe Aerosmith did theirs without Joey Kramer! WTF!
Mind your own business. You haven't got a clue about U2. Muppet.
Achtung Baby was the last completely good album for me, after that, only a couple of good songs in each album. It's so sad they made this kind of decision. Poor hired gun drummer, I feel for him, he'll get a lot of undeserved hate.
If they want to get out and see people, maybe they want to do an actual tour of different cities and countries and not tie it up in a Las Vegas residency.
Larry Mullen Jr to join Foo Fighters ;)  And yeah... stupid idea. Tickets are expensive enough these days without the whole band not being there. Also... how many pushes are they doing at one time? They've just started releasing these terrible re-imagined 40 songs. But then they are at the same time announcing an Achtung Baby push? It's too much, especially when everybody and their dog is touring to make up for the last couple years.
U2 jumped the credibility shark decades ago; this is just confirmation for the rest of you.
The Old Boys want to stay in one place.. and keep making’ the $$$$..  Taxes are high.. Mansions are big….  And there’s still a lot of hungry hurting folks..
Seems suspect.
I agree they should do this without Larry...but I disagree that a younger fan can't find Actung Baby a compelling enough album that they would want to see them play live.  As an aside, I've been a U2 Fan since they played the Paradise Club in Boston, back when I rode my dinosaur to work. :)
I would like to know when they signed the contact to play this gig. I imagine it was well before LM needed surgery. I imagine the contract is VERY specific about what is allowed to cancel the gig. A sick or band member is probably not on that list.  They didn't kick him out of the band. After he has healed, he will be back. Not sure what the big deal is.
It's not the same, but Mick and Keith did replace Charlie Watts, so
Now if they were touring without Bono I would happily see them ;)
Maybe they can learn from Adele, who cancelled her Las Vegas residency 24hrs before it was due to start. She wasn't happy with it and had it rescheduled for a later date.
U2 is one of my favorite bands ever. I'm only 34, but discovering Achtung Baby and the ZOOTV Sydney performance pretty much changed my life around 15 years ago. I will always admire them, and I still consider No Line on the Horizon their last great successful attempt at something unique only they and their producers are capable of. A Vegas residency, to me, is in itself sad, but without Larry Mullen, it's an absolute waste. I truly love U2 and always will. But their desperation to say "relevant" has been their worst enemy for a while. No Line on the Horizon was an artistic triumph, but a commercial disappointment, and since then, they've seemed desperate to get their moment again, ignoring what people most expect: great, adventurous music. They will never be the trendiest band in the world, and that's just fine. It's a shame they seem to care so much about the spotlight they were so good at rejecting not so long ago. In any case, U2 will always be an amazing band, I just wish they realized it more often.
I'm a huge U2 fan and Achtung Baby is my favorite album of all time.  I'll be skipping these shows. No Larry, no U2. U2 is the sum of their parts. Playing without a member is like trying to drive a car with three wheels.
totally agree with you Rick. Larry is such a unique and amzing drummer. Live in my opinion he is 50% (or more) of the band.
Lol, I've got to agree! Was there any demand for an Achteung Baby tour?
Band / Brand / Bland . Stones ,no Charlie Who , no Keith Z Z TOP , no Dusty and so it goes . $ talks .💰
I wanna see them put on an amazing technology show and its sad larry cant do it, but if he is ok with it, do it !  im going !!!! Achtung Baby changed my life i saw Zoo TV Live 3 times and have seen U2 live 11 times and  counting !
"my buddy, Rich"... did you see what you did there?
Dear RICK, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ? You make a lot of assumptions.  What if Mullen wants them to play ? Its their band and they should play music as much as they want.  Don't like the lineup? Don't friggin go.  You have no idea what will come out of those guys being in the same space for all that time ? Another U2 album? You think U2's new manager gets 20%??? or had any say in this ??  Are you on the pipe??:) You sound like an old man complaining because you want to complain.  Don't you think the drummer that will play will be amazing?  I like a great deal of what you are doing but I think your RANT is just RONG.
With or without you?
Someone has a balloon payment due.
I also saw the original Achtung Baby tour in '92 or '93, in Oakland, CA. Great shows, but I wouldn't go see them now.
I'm from the Netherlands and no one here even know via what route U2 dug up the Dutch fill-in drummer. The guy is obviously a great drummer,  but it's weird.
I just have one question.....what's residency concert? 🤔
I'm a drummer and I love Larry. Always have. But I gotta say, for the last 20 years or so, I have noticed that Larry seems incredibly bored of the whole thing. He used to play with a lot of conviction, but now he barely hits the drums at all. Maybe he is too old to play hard for two hours at a time, or maybe he is just done with playing drums and was just doing it for the money. I'm shocked, but not surprised to be honest.
Strangely no mention of the stones in this? Chance is this was all set in stone when Larry informed the band of his absence. And if Larry is okay with it, why shouldn't everyone else? I usually agree with you on your views Rick, but I really don't see what the big deal is. And i'm a drummer.
I can't understand if Rick's point is that the band should quit altogether (the point about the Beatles, Police, etc.), or if he's OK with them still making/playing music, but not without Mullen.
I'm mixed on this one. Part of me doesn't care too much who sits at the kit.  My first Who show in '82 was with Kenny Jones; never got to see Keith Moon.  Didn't see Pearl Jam until Matt Cameron joined in '98.   Didn't see Yes w/ Bill Bruford; first Yes concert was with Alan White. Didn't get to see John Silver or John Mayhew w/ Genesis. I saw their third drummer Phil something. Never saw John Rutsey with Rush.  Never saw RHCP prior to Chad Smith.  Never saw Petty's first drummer.  Put an asterisk next to 2023 if you must but I look at it as a unique opportunity to see a temporary, different version of U2.
Holy Friggin Boomer vid
Give um a break Rick...Maybe it's just for their own amusement....and it can't  get more fun than Las Vegas....Loose change for the slot machine....after playing a few tunes.....Nice work if you can get it....🤠
What If Larry Mullen is really sick… remember what happened to Depeache Mode during the pandemic with Allan Moulder… best wishes to Larry and his family, hope everything is alright.
Imagine if Aerosmith replaced Joey Kramer after 40 years! Oh wait...
Really, it's Larry's band. He started it all. Without him, it's just weird... like Rush without Peart, or Zep without Bonham.
It's their band, also Larry gave his blessing and helped in chosing his replacement. He obviously doesn't have much of a problem with it as some fans do.. Fans who peobably were never attending the residency gigs in the first place.
When Phil Collins, at age 70, slowly walked out to sit on a stool and sing for Genesis as his son played drums, I realized what a toll a lifetime of drumming takes on the body.  If LMJ needs some tweaks to play later in life, I hope he has the best surgeries and recoveries.
I like the innovation of the edge, but can't stand boner
What they meant was  they miss the faces on the dollar bills from touring.
Rick, you need to have this talk with Roger Daltrey & Pete Townsend. I thought for sure after the “Ox” passed they would call it quits. Now they’re the Who -2.
Yeah Baby!!
I respectfully disagree…. U2 are getting older. They are not “replacing” him if he can’t physically perform at the time the other members wish to work. Bands do this all the time on tour if a band member gets hurt or has a family conflict.
U2 was over by the time of the bloated Rattle and Hum
I live in the past anyway. I can listen to the music as it was anytime I choose. What any band or their members do these days doesn't affect me either way. I still like their music and that can take me back.
I don't get it. I really hate U2. I was coerced to go to a U2 concert in 2009, I was never more bored in my life. The worst part was I had to wait till the end to hear the one song I actually liked. Don't get me wrong I can listen to their music on the radio, but Muse opened for them and they killed it. I have been a muse fan ever since. Should left after the opening band finished.
Great rant, totally agree...  but I'm distracted by the guitar in the rack moving at 4:36...
No big deal.  Your guy that just did the 20 drum solos in your video can fill in just fine.  What U2 really needs is the guy from Greta Van Fleet to replace Bono.
Wow, talk about old man-rant. You can’t really be this upset about them having someone fill in on drums. Really? Really?
U2 is on my all-time over rated list just my opinion.  Never been a fan.  No my band is not bigger or even better than U2... just never liked them.   Also Bono= 💩 \m/  (>,<)  \m/
Agree, Rick.  Def Leppard held off playing shows until Rick Allen figured out how to play drums again after losing an arm in a car accident.  WTF, U2???
People get older and want to retire.  Or go in other directions.  Or recover from illness.  It happens.  Bill Wyman left the Stones.  In Yes the only original member is Steve Howe.  And they are great in concert.  I assume he is at the helm making sure the sound is right.  But find a good replacement and go on.  It may be only temporary.
Irony of ironies: Bono has become ZOO-TV's MacPhisto, in Bono's own words, (paraphrasing) the tired, sad pop star who can't let go of the glory days and milks whatever he has left on the Las Vegas strip. Life imitating art. Sad.
Money talks.
Seems there really is No forgiveness for success1‼️
It ain't about the fans or performing live. There are three reasons they're doing this. Money, money, and what was the last one again, oh ya, money.
Lots of whinging in the video.  Very little factual information.  Larry Mullen Jr (may have surgery) - okay, if so, I would think it a pretty serious surgery, and not something minor.  Basing that theory on the presumption that it takes a fair while to negotiate a Las Vegas residency.  Dunno if that's true.  That's the only logical reason I can think of for using a replacement drummer.  Anyway, I don't care much.  Stopped listening to U2 when Achtung! Baby came out.  Only Boy/October/War made the transition to CD in my house.
Isn't he recovering from surgery, hence his absence? Surely that's understandable- no?
I don't think you are being fair to the fill in drummer! It must be amazing for him! Also their shows mean WORK for more than just the band members
Maybe he’s burned out…
It’s really interesting to see this video, because I had no idea about the Vegas residency, but just 2 days ago was wondering when the band was going to come to an end, disintegrate, or do something odd like this. I have enjoyed select music by them for the last few decades, but man, the 80s era of the band, when I was a teenager, was life changing. And I don’t just mean the music - the entire “aura” or mystique. I can’t find the right words. At least I have my memories, including a beautiful day in 1987: It was the day the Joshua Tree came out. It also happened to be the day I bought my first drum machine. I stopped by the mall afterward and bought the cassette. I remember heading home on the interstate, the windows down, the opening to “Streets” beginning, and looking over at the box my drum machine was in. I lived far enough away from the city that I heard the entire album before I got home. I was moved by it. It was strange to hear something that was brand new, but seemed timeless. Ahh, memories of a more sane and fun world.
U2 without Larry! It doesn't make any sense...
There are lots of bands I don't like but only one I detest. Guess who?
If he's sick and not seeing that he's going to be getting better enough to start touring any time soon, and publicly voices consent that he's good with them doing shows again without him, then I think that may be acceptable to the U2 fans...and I just looked up, and that appears to be the case in regard to this:  U2's drummer Larry Mullen Jr. has ruled himself out of touring with U2 next year due to ongoing physical health issues. The 61-year-old sticksman explained that he requires surgery after injuring his “elbows, knees [and] neck", and should Bono and co decide to hit the road in 2023, he won't be joining them.Dec 6, 2022  This is kind of the same deal in regard to Motley Crew with them replacing 1981 founding member, Mick Mars, because his health situation prohibited him to continue, and John 5 stepped in...
The most overrated band of all time...
Exactly!
I'm pretty sure this will be for a great cause. Bono will give all the money to the poor.
Quote from NME: _Larry Mullen Jr. says he may not drum with U2 if the band tours in 2023 The U2 bandmate said elbow and knee injuries will force him "to take some time… to get myself healed”_
I saw them in Paris in 1989. God they were good. That said they have not made a good record since 2004.
Hate u2
Come on man. Toto without the great Jeff Porcaro is still Toto. U2 just want to do this for just one tour.
So... Who ran out of money? That's the first thing I thought of... Someone's bankrupt,  and talked the others into it.
If he can't perform due to ill-health and is ok with the rest of them playing with a temporary drummer, surely that's up to him? 🤔 Sometimes it seems fans think they own the bands and must do what they say. And what is Rick's thoughts on the Stones carrying on after Charlie's death? Did he want them to retire?
All of them are replaceable at this point.  Just release the holograms of them and pre-recorded tracks for these massive productions and be done with it.
U2 is one of the worst rock bands of all time
They jumped the shark long ago.
Crazy how business works sometimes, amirite?
Spot on!
I wanna see them play achtung baby !!!!!!! my favorite album. Rick i was at veterans stadium in for zoo tv as well
It’s not uncommon to have someone else stand in when a member is sick. I highly doubt they made this decision without Larry’s blessing. Did you feel the same way about The Rolling Stones when they continued to tour after Charlie Watts died? Or after Brian Jones left? Or after Bill Wyman quit?
I believe they have canceled or delayed gigs dues to Bono losing his voice, no much else they can do there. But also Bono's back. So why not wait until Larry is able to play again? It's so rare that a band with that kind of longevity still features all its original members, much less one where each of the four is so integral to what the band is. It's really something special. And worth waiting for. They can't possibly need to make another dollar. It genuinely shortchanges fans.
Greed is a real thing...
Agree 100%. U2 is one of those bands where the drummer's style kind of makes their songs. Maybe not so much as: The Police, Genesis, Led Zeppelin, The Who. However, Larry Mullen Jr. still has a signature sound that wouldn't be present at these Vegas shows. Fans want to see the band, not just Bono.
Achtung is  the only album of theirs I really liked
I would suggest replacing Bono with Dua Lipa on the show. Then they would fit better into current events.
Great, Beato's gospel!
Part of their Elvis fetish, following in his footsteps to play in Vegas.  I think this will be cringey.
Don't see what the big deal is. Maybe the drummer told the guys they should do this. Maybe some want to play and some don't. This happens to almost every single band as they age. Whether its a mistake will be seen by the audience. I'm willing to bet they sell out everything. And I've been a fan since day 1. Same vintage as Rick +2or3. Respectfully, this isn't worth ranting over when we do not know any details of how the decision was made. Plus, no tour travel, same location for guys that are getting older. I fail to see the downside or how its a bad decision.
Should the Foo Fighters continue on with a new drummer? Or call it a career?
Anyone else see the ghost move that yellow guitar at 4:36?
i fear that this is driven by numbers - the show was apparently planned and scoped in 2019. Covid has delayed things - and now Larry is unwell. given it is a technologically driven show in a new mega-venue 'the show must go on' - with or without Larry. Therefore, Rick, you are probably wrong - quitting is not an option.
I have little sympathy for people who are outraged that U2 gave out a free album.  How dare they?!  But going on stage without Larry Mullin Jr.?  That just seems like not only a bone headed move, but a hurtful one.
Rick I could not agree more. As a U2 fan since 1981, first concert Paradise Theater Club Boston 3/81, this is a mistake. I have gone to ever tour (except Rattle and Hum in Australia) and I will not be going to this one…
Larry's been not doing well for a couple of years. He's getting surgery for back issues. Been known for a while now
I want to see these shows I love that record and zootv was my first u2 concert
Speaking of the Apple Store, have you noticed there is no longer a Genius Bar? I would suggest that one need'nt strain one's eyes to see the symbolism there, regarding both the Apple brand and our culture in general.
Achtung Baby is the only album I loved by U2. I remember my mom buying a CD player just for that album and Toy Matinee, I was 9 I think. And I remember telling her. “U2 is really good” and her saying something like “I’m glad you think so”  Toy Matinee blew that out of the water though.
Sorry but if the guy can play the parts there is still 75% of the band playing. Alternative is 0% of the band playing. Not sure if fans would prefer that. Sorry man, but this is ranting for the sake of ranting before a note (or beat) is played 🤷🏻‍♂️
Bram van den Berg from the Dutch band Krezip is the drummer U2 sought for the Las Vegas concerts. He's a very good drummer - and a big U2 fan. Of course he jumped at the chance to fill in for Larry. Meanwhile Krezip canceled their shows until when Bram returns. Let's allow him to enjoy this unique gig and hope it all turns out well.
This is bullshit! I wanna see Larry play drums on my second favorite U2 album. Can't they wait until he heals? I thought U2 was like RUSH. The brotherhood being too strong to go on without another member. Massive FAIL...
I love U2 but they've missed a step and have faded somewhat in recent years. Their last album was dreary for me..Piano pop rock stuff that lacked the Edge! It just sounded tired. None of the younger music reactors react online to their stuff relative to the Beatles,Queen ,Zep,BeeGees,Floyd, Metallica. They shouldn't do the gig without Larry.
Saw that tour at the Omni in Atlanta.  My first concert!  Public Enemy and Big Audio Dynamite opened!
I had the impression that he didn't want to do it...
Ah! New manager. Now this makes sense. I’ll still be a fan and hope to see the residency but I can’t imagine it’d be great without LMjr.
I've deleted that U2 album on my Iphone too many times and it keeps coming back.  It messes with me cause I listen to my tunes on shuffle most times.
Hey, don't underestimate Bram van den Berg. Krezip (his band) is the Netherlands' top Acapella Technical Death Core ensemble.
"It was the Larry Mullen Band for about 10 minutes until Bono walked in." 😉
Saw them in New Zealand… brilliant!! Just looses its heartbeat without Larry.
I wanted the "free" U2 album off my ipod because it stunk, and it would come up ALOT when I'd hit random.
Why still no videos about Toy Matinee?!?!?!?
agree
1. They are CERTAINLY going to play stuff from their whole catalog. 2. I'm sure that MGM has an opening date and they want the biggest band in the world to play it. 3. Sadly, Larry is not well, we'll be praying for him. 4. The show must go on.  I think i LOT of newer fans don't even know who Larry is, they'll go see U2 with ANY drummer as long as Bono is singing. if they residency lasts, and Larry gets better, they will sell a WHOLE NEW crop of tickets and probably a lot of people will see the show again.  The real issue will be, how long can you keep the boys out of Dublin? If we use the Zoo Tour as a guide, then we can assume about 2 years that they can handle "being on the road".  Larry will be missed, but it'll still be a nice show.
The dude is 61 and rich as hell.  Even musicians are allowed to retire or take a break if they want to.
Okay.. I understand your point.  But will you go see them?
If U2 really had to play in Las Vegas, they could at least ask Antonio Sanchez. Great drummer!
I’m still blundering into songs from that terrible album! Luckily I delete as soon as I see it!
I'm a fan of Rick but this is an awful take.  I'd be shocked if even 25% of bands from the 80's are touring with the original lineup.
Ric,  I agree with you . U2 is, are, and will be those 4 guys. Money talks everyone else can walk.
Doesn't have anything to do with money though.  (sarcasm)
Bunch ae tossers ..I give not  a F..k
Maybe Larry doesn’t want a Vegas residency?
Who doesn't wish Zeppelin had just found a new drummer? Or if The Who hadn't carried on without Keith?
Since 1/4 of the real band is playing, shouldn't they be billed as U1.5?
i am an early fan , but i gave up on them after  Joshua Tree
Rick you should interview Larry Mullin Jr. since it seems unlikely that Bono or the other members would be up for it any time soon.
Funny, Mullen always sounded to me like a bodran player with a full kit....YMMV                                As far as continuing without original members...... Rolling Stones? AC/DC? Metalica? Red Hot Chili Peppers?  yes, it can be done....
The December 2019 show they're talking about, I was there. It was the best show I've ever seen in my life.
I got to vegas  for  whores who will not tell my wife i have had sex with them in exchange for money.
I guess I don't understand the bitterness. Mullen is hurt and they want to play so they got a sub. Ho long should they wait before touring? We don't know the extent of Mullen's injury(ies), so why judge them so harshly?
I'm guessing the members of U2 still like making a lot of money 💰.   I guess Larry Mullen Jr. Is ok with them doing these shows.
You have mick fleetwood saying Fleetwood Mac will not tour without Christine McVie, I bet you thats Bullshit, see them next year. Can any band ever call it a day, these Days
After Achtung baby I had enough of Bono and his preaching, but loved all the albums prior, saw them in ‘87 in Vancouver during the Joshua tree tour, that will always be U2 to me .
You can't have Achtung Baby without Larry Mullen Jr. Drum sounds defined that album. And it's by far their best.
It feels like a really sad way to end a band that has touched so many people. I would rather they just come out and say "this is the end" than try to limp along doing casino residences with stand-in players. That's not what U2 has ever stood for. It's a shame.
What about the stones going on without Charlie W ?
I met Larry at Windmill Lane Studios when I was in college and was a U2 freak in 1989.  What a great guy.  I also had a big man crush on Bono back then, and his vocal lines taught me more than anyone how to sing.  It's too bad that Bono has become such a pompous ass.  I resent seeing him at the State of the Union, and resent him thinking he can tell U.S. citizens how to live.  Bono is just another billionaire hypocrite.  The self proclaimed "champion" of the poor Irish and impoverished of the world moved the corporate headquarters of U2 out of Ireland as soon as Ireland decided to abolish their traditional policy of not taxing artists.  A guy who stands up for the poor in public, but refuses to give them his tax money....Larry is probably sick of his BS too...
I LOVED us for the first 15 years of their recorded existence. The reason I BECAME a musician! Since then, not so much.
Maybe Bono has to push the WEF agenda and make more money to fuel his private jet to stop climate crisis. Maybe larry woke up and don't wanna push that nonsense agenda.
average fan doesn't care about the musicians (singer excluded). drummer least of all.
On the plus side, maybe tickets to their Vegas show will be more affordable. You know, like, 25% off or something? 😁
Bono being blown by the wind
Rick, you hit the nail on the head when you mentioned the retirement of Paul McGuinness. They’ve literally done nothing of real impactful artistic consequence since then and they’ve made a succession of bad business decisions. The primary purpose of any U2 manager has to be to facilitate the tours which were always the logical continuation of the current album’s narrative so you felt you were riding along on a great artistic wave. That hasn’t happened since maybe No Line on the Horizon. Las Vegas??? They’ve become a cabaret act. A tribute act of themselves. I suspect Larry wants no part in it!
I’ve read that Larry’s hands are damaged and he can no longer play drums.
Apparently, Larry has recently had some kind of surgery that he is recovering from.
Bono-  Sorry Larry... we are doing these Vegas 💰 gigs With or Without You
I saw U2 Live when they first came to the US. They were very good. Then…..
Maybe U2 signed a contract and couldn't postpone the concerts?
Achtung Baby must be their most romantic collection of songs! I remember it was playing continuously on the radio when it came out. Glad to hear that it’s still popular.
The Stones without Charlie The Who without Moon Black Sabbath without Bill..........keep going.
This would be like Dream Theater replacing Mike Portnoy.  Oh wait…
I feel the same way about KISS, but I'm not a "real fan."
I think Rick just Blew his Shot at A Bono interview 🤙
That ad was a million dollars well spent.
Rush is smart enough to know that Rush without Neil Peart does not exist. U2 is making a mistake. For longevity, look at French band Magma, who are now 54 years into their existence, but with always changing personnel including children of former band members.
U .....Who?
As a fan, something without Larry Mullen Jr is as disappointing as a cancellation.
Wtf is Ricks problem? Metallica did a gig without Lars. ACDC did several gigs without Brian Johnson. If someone in the band cant make it but you want to keep the ball rolling (ESPECIALLY after a freaking global pandemic) you just do not wait. If I would be this drummer I would actually tell my band mates to not wait for me and get the f*** out there. He will be back when he can.
i'm a fan of the band as well (was at the, "Under A Blood Red Sky" concert at Red Rocks)...but, the sheer arrogance of forcing everyone on itunes to have, "Songs of Innocence" in their libraries was astounding (and incredibly annoying)...
The Unforgettable Fired amiright’?
Very well said.  I’ve been a massive U2 fan for so long that they were my favourite band when most people (at least in North America) had not yet heard of them.  U2 without Larry Mullen Jr. isn’t U2.
They are creative guys who want to be out there.  I could see the remaking of the 40 songs as a companion for the audio book by Bono.  I have mixed emotions of them doing an anniversary of a classic album tour without Larry.  New music without Larry...maybe you get away with that, but not a tour honoring Achtung.  And I have been a fan since 1983 and seen them multiple times over the last 30 years.
Bono should have called the band ME2
This was all over the news in Holland, all seem to be proud a Dutch drummer gets to play with U2.
Lots of stupid comments here as always, loads of haters. If anything, U2 is an UNDERRATED band by now, not overrated! That said, they made a lot of poor decisions which led them to be almost universially hated. Awful PR work and poor, middle-of-the-road material brought them here. POP was the last exciting U2 record but due to the ordinary 'Fuck Yeah' Yank's disapproval of it, it flopped.  Had U2 followed that path, they might have had a few shitty years up until say 2010, but they would've held on to their integrity and by this point been a revered band along the likes of The Cure and Depeche Mode.  Instead, they catered to the masses, and as a result the music is just about as interesting as most of the Average Joes they appeal to. It's been a massive sellout since 2000, and this is a natural step on that path. A massive fan of their 80's and 90's work, I am greatly disappointed in my favorite band.
Loyalty to your band members before anyone or anything else. The only option with integrity.
Surrounded by yes man Just a big Corporate machine living off past glories  Still mad for the Green Pathetic
U2 being out of touch again?  said it aint so!
Yeah, I didn’t dislike Rattle and Hum, but it was disappointing. Discovered U2 in 1982 and then parted ways with Them when Achtung Baby came out. Not my bag.That said, I can’t help But feel this is purely driven by money. They don’t need any more. One last pay day? Why don’t they just sell their back catalogue and be done with it?
Seriously, why doesn't Bono just write another book.  They haven't played in that long and now they want to play Vegas like some has been band.  Spare me.  They don't need to.  Have some integrity.  You can't play without Larry.  If it was one date, fair enough.
iTunes was always more of a virus than a program, anyway. But I thought you were going to talk about the awkward timing of a promotion featuring what looked like a spy balloon considering recent events in which jets are now shooting down balloons left and right. LOL. Also,  you didn't mention their worse promotion, the Pop Mart thing which sucked ass. U2 has a long history of stupid things.
If the band is ok with it, AND the sound is covered....I say play the gig.  So many players in and out of most bands.  I think shows a mature level of detachment. YES would have played about 90% less shows had they stuck to original line ups ;)
Lets turn this around with historical perspective. How many great bands haven't toured an amazing album/show without one of its band members?
It is a temporary replacement. For all we know Larry came up with it and selected his replacement. Have you listened to how good he is before you created this? He is actually quite a good drummer and I think they went through some process before doing all this. Maybe you are right, but maybe you will have to eat your words. Let's hope for the second option.
The Rolling Stones replaced their drummer after 50 years.... And yes Rick, I do understand your frustration. But talking about 'some guy' or 'some drummer' is maybe a bit disrespectful to that guy. I'm sure they found someone who is up to the job. Does not mean I do not agree with you about the choice to replace Larry Mullen.
I'm at least thankful that Robert Plant stood his ground with the idea of some kind of Zep tour, and also glad that Geddy and Alex decided there is no Rush without Neil.  Money talks though, so maybe that's the reason.
I agree 100%!! Actung Baby was my introduction to U2 at 12 years old and is my all time favorite U2 album. But I don’t care what album it is…. No Larry = no U2. Period. Side note: I hate Vegas residency shows and I think they’re cop outs for people too lazy to tour.
As soon as a band with the original members for so long decides to change a lineup, everything changes. It is their choice for sure. But it also sounds like this isn't permanent. Perhaps they were already committed to all the advertising, etc. As long as the fans know this isn't going to be the entire U2 lineup. It's their $$ that gets laid out. I saw a clip of Motley Crüe with John 5 in place of Mick. I know it's  not the same. But John 5 is incredibley talented. So I say if you like the temporary U2, buy a ticket. If you don't, then save your money.
Boomers have a real hard time letting go. It's why our congress and senate are filled with them. It's why 83% of CEOs are boomers. And it's why 78% of all property is owned by them. They just wont fucking let go. Woodstock shouldve ended with napalm.
I used to like em until i realised what a tosser their lead singer is. Sorry for being negative but he is.
It'll be EZdrummer 3 anyhow Rick 🤘
Capitalists gonna capitalise.
Just more $$$$ then?
They should have taken a lesson from Led Zeppelin and Bonzo.
He's 61 years old. Things start dropping off.
You’ve got to understand that like in the world of rock and roll there are certain changes that sometimes occur, and you’ve just got to, sort of, roll with them, you know. I mean you read... you read... you saw exactly how many people who’s been in this band over the years, 37 people’s been in this band over the years. I mean it’s like, you know, six months from now, I can’t see myself missing Nigel more than I might miss Ross McLochness, or Ronnie Pudding, or Danny Upham, or Little Danny Schindler, or any of those, you know, it’s...    MARTY: I can’t...I can’t believe it. I can’t believe that, you know, that, you’re lumping Nigel in with uh you know these people you’ve played with for a short period of time...    DAVID: Well, I’m sure I’d feel much worse if I weren’t under such heavy sedation, but still in all, I mean you’ve got to be realistic about this sort of thing, you know....
Excellent
Really, who cares?
U2 never understood how much their Drummer made the Hits!
As much as anyone can fill in for Larry Mullen, when it's not the original members it's not U2. Only got to see REM after Bill Berry left after having grown up with their music, it just wasn't "right". A rose by any other name... it still has to be the rose though.
Fair enough - it didn't make sense to me and I suppose the contracts/money was too good at this point.  Kinda funny when you think about their message.  You going to Pollstar next week?
Sorry, but the show must go on. Bands change lineups all the time, and frankly, Bono and the Edge are more significant components than Larry or even Adam.
Maybe you've already said, but  what's your take on John 5 replacing Mick Mars?
No!  Someone was honest and THEY DIDN"T LISTEN.  PEOPLE do what they want to do.  If they're determined, they will get their way.  Just look at the country!   They were told and they didn't believe!   There are far more bad ideas than good idesa because smart people consider unintended consequences;  everyone else creates, takes the credits and wants no part of the resulting problems.
I have listened to them since "Boy" came out. This is all about money.
Larry's not permanently replaced. Also the Beatles played without Ringo. As someone who was at the same Philly and Hawaii gig Rick, I agree it's weird.
90% of their fans can't afford these shows.  Bono is completely out-of-touch.  The music has no edge, the dramatic autobiography, now this...
U2 is one of the most over rated bands of all time, IMHO.
From what I understand, Larry Mullen Jr has suffered from back pain for years now. This stuck out to me because I have as well. Evidently one of the surgeries he underwent had less than a ‘good outcome’. Like you, I can’t see U2 performing without Larry… or any of the quartet. They’re all so individual in their styles of performance that it would seem glaringly obvious if any of them were missing. Even with someone who might be able to ‘get close’ to their particular sound.   U2 want to perform live. We all want to see them perform live. But we want ‘them’ not a facsimile. Even a good facsimile. I hope Larry feels better soon, and I hope U2 realize the danger they’re playing with. Things like this has ended bands.
Has anybody heard what Larry says about this ? I haven’t . Maybe he’s fine with it. I’m sure he’s still getting paid.
Nothing lasts forever.  What do you think would be a befitting last hurrah for a supergroup that's dominated concert stadiums the world over, since 1985?  If you were going to choose a swansong, what would it be?  A Vegas residency, maybe..... ?  And what if, by the time you'd decided that, your drummer felt he just couldn't go on?  What do you do then - cancel your plans?  Forget about your swansong?  Come on, Rick.  Give em a break.  With Covid, they never had a farewell tour.  Don't you think they should???
The Guess Who for years played without Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings; so perhaps for the sakes of just performing or just earning more cash - sometimes other members go on performing without key band members? My question is why Vegas? It just hurt Elvis playing there too long.
Achtung Baby is my fav album of all time. The band though, in the last 10+ years has become a sad parody of themselves. All their old beliefs (forward thinking, never revisit the past, etc) they just turned their backs on their principles. Milking the old cow (Joshua Tree Anniversary Tour, re-imagining their hits album, Achtung Baby residency (without Larry))..I recall a legendary singer once sang “You glorify the past, when the future dries up….”. Oh right that legendary singer is you Bono!
I live in Vegas, I have to go.  Wish the entire band was there, but what an opportunity.  I’ll be going
Huge fan since 81. Last show i saw was 2005. Was at the vet show, zootv. Was at the achtubg baby show april of 92, spectrum.  Saw them on ar, unforgettable, joshua, achtung, zooropa,, pop and atomic.   The degree to which Bono especially has fallen into a staye of clueless globalist breaks my heart. Im w you on this rick.
gives some people a chance to experience them, I saw Billy Joel and he really delivered. Bruce never let's me down. There are many I missed and would like to see.
My jaw hit the floor too.  I've been a fan since 1984
Slags.
It seems very selfish to do that residency without him.
Maybe I'm wrong here but I don't think you do a Vegas gig 'for the fans'.  Most of the people seeing you are people who are visiting Vegas for OTHER reasons.  It's like when I saw Carlin in the late 90s - I love his stuff but I was in Vegas for a friend's wedding, he was a bonus (as were the Cranberries at the Palms).  So, I'm thinking most of the people seeing their show there probably can't even name their drummer and their manager at least probably knows that.
I just cannot believe this! They should know fans would rather wait for LMJ to get better than to have some random drummer!! Definitely not going to that show……
ACHTUNG BABY = BERLIN WALL has fallen down, they drove the iconic communist car trabant across Berlin in ONE.
Rick it ain't about the money..U2 is one of the richest out there..its about the technology..they have always been the band that got the first crack at new technology..just look at their innovative stadium shows that every other band was envious of.They were the first band to tour with a global satellite linkup(ZOO TV) the first band that ever toured with a   HD screen (POPMART tour) The first band that had a stage shaped like a claw for stadium shows that you could hang the speakers and screen off of with the latest HD at the time.(360 tour) The first band that toured with a  7K resolution screen.(Joshua Tree 30th anniversary tour) This new SPHERE arena in Las Vegas has multimedia in 16K they wanted to be the first band to open the venue. It makes sense and Larry Mullen Jr signed off on it..if he didn't he would have quit the band. I don't like the idea of them having this residency without him but it is what it is..he will be back in 2024.
I just got tickets to see Live (the band) with JUST Ed Kowalczyk in it. Pretty weird, but I think it should be a fun show. I'm sure U2 will put out a high-quality and entertaining show. Plus make a shitload of cash.
Your confusing the artist with the business. No shows, no income. This is a huge corporate business with employees and taxes to pay. And is it really that hard to believe that new fans of u2 will gravitate to their best work? That would be like saying no young kid could possibly appreciate the Beatles. Nonsense! I love the album, I love the songs, I love the spectacle. I won’t miss Larry! Love him. But it’s not the end of the world, Until? 🤣
For what I understand, it's just the Vegas residency that Larry is not playing. Next year when they do a full Achtung Baby tour Larry will be back.
U1.5
Is Larry hangin out with Bun E. Carlos?
I feel like RB just poked a bee's nest, but he's right, and whatever follows will be entertaining.
I think the harsh reality may be that the average person going to see a show in Vegas doesn't know anyone in the band other than Bono and maybe The Edge. The band and management know this. The hardcore U2 fan will be pissed, but 80-90% of the concert going public can't name most members of a band or their albums, they know the hits and show up expecting to see Bono and whoever else is playing they really don't care about.
U2 sucks , period
at 1:24 and 5:08 the natural-tone les paul moves. did you play it and then think better of the middle section and then go rerecord that part? curious...
I am sorry Larry! Makes me mad actually!👿
What ever happened to band loyalty? Is Larry filing for free agency? I listen to songs like "Desire" where Larry's drumming is the signature sound. 🤔
So by his own account Larry needs a surgery just to allow him to keep playing. Doesn't say what but i bet he needs some elbow work which can lead to a long recovery. And if you have to have BOTH done they normally do not do those both at the same time in order to give you at least one functional arm. We also don't really know WHEN these shows were contracted as I have seen a couple articles that U2 has long been the planned opening act for the Sphere.  Without actually talking to them(I wish hahaha), I will simply presume (perhaps wrongly) that they have discussed this and determined it to be the best option. Does it suck? Absolutely. But it does not seem like a permanent change so will just wait and see.
I hope Larry recovers from his injuries, ailments and surgeries and returns to the stage with his band!
I agree. U2 without Larry isn’t U2.   REM wasn’t ever the same without Bill Berry.
U1!! You have to call it U1!!
Henry Rollins had sn interesting take on  U2
Eh, it's just a Vegas show.  Wind it up and repeat the same set, over and over again in the exact same venue with essentially the same audience every night.
Bono has always been a smug opportunist ... this is my opinion
Im no fan of U2, they've never hit home for me, but I cant deny their class/longevity and the 10 or so songs of theirs that I have to admit...really fuckin rock!  In saying that, if one of my fave bands who had been so solid, for even half the time U2 have been, tried this stunt!? I'd be be properly fucked off too. Nevermind the concept of a Las Vega residency being utterly cringe. Abysmal.
Well I still saw Van Halen twice when Wolfgang Van Halen replaced former bassist Michael Anthony and I have no regrets.
When Ringo was sick the Beatles played with another drummer
Led Zeppelin - John Bonham. Without John Bonham there is no Led Zeppelin!  I personally think it has a lot to do with the Kiev thing with that aNzi.... I don't think we'll see Larry Mullen again. U2, a bunch of idiots now! And I was a BIG FAN! Vegas - I hope it's a wash-out!
What happens when you shake hands with biden and accept the honours of the sick establishment ?
I’m thinking commitments were made and LMJ backed out because of his health issue.
It's all about the money now. Been listening to U2 since New Year's Day came out. Watched them live in Glasgow in 1993.
Would you mind if 3/4 of the band played U2 songs live if they didn’t call themselves U2?    People get sick, they don’t owe explanations to anyone. If a musician becomes seriously I’ll or dies, does this mean that 3/4 of the band shouldn’t ever play together again?
Remember when Led Zeppelin lost their drummer and that was the end of the band?
the couple of tracks that I've heard from the upcoming 40 song retrospective are not terribly good either. And I'm a huge fan of U2.
I can't imagine how much Ticketmaster is getting for this residency. And if I were to imagine it - it would enrage me.
Is this a sort of homecoming of sorts, sort of?
Have to agree, Rick. Totally tone deaf. Not to mention the timing of the weird spy balloon-looking stuff in the video.
Definitely a band made up of four key parts. I've followed them since the War tour but increasingly...they have lost me. Frankly, a Las Vegas residency is enough to question their validity. But doing it without Larry Mullin Junior is...not U2. Well said Rick.
U2 is a has been band...U2 Joshua Tree - good stuff - the rest you can have - walked out half way of their concert.. Bono wants to be a black Mandela..
I've been a fan since 1981 as a 14 year old.
I just want to go on record saying "Songs of Innocence" is a great album.  Fell in love with it 3 years ago.
I hate when musicians try to be politicians
What Rick says...100%
We love our fans all over the world so much that they better drag their asses all the way to the to sleazy gambling town in the middle of the desert cause we ain't going nowhere. PS bring lots of cash
I read an article (interview) with Larry Mullins, Jr. at the tale end of last year. He talked how drumming for all those years, his body is a bit broken, and he needed to fix it. He said he had no idea if U2 was going on tour this year, but, if they did, he wouldn't be joining them.  My first and only thought was well, U2's done. It's the four of them or none of them.....Guess I was wrong...I can't imagine seeing them without him drumming
Rant away!!  No good thing can come if this !  Where is the loyalty?  Can u imagine how he feels?  The fans want the real thing… they will lose fans….😢
How about going to Vegas to see ‘U1 in concert 😂’ and Not U2 anymore.
Larry Mullen Jr. has been reduced to the role of a drum machine for decades....real drums disappeared long ago
That was awesome :) proud fellow Atlantan :)
U2 are excellent performers but they flew up their own arses a long long time ago particulary Bono (he was always like that probably).  The rock band of the elite.
Sounds like he’s having surgery
Will wait to see the show when Larry comes back. Otherwise, why even bother?!
You know if I had certain key members i would call it Live Bait. It needs to be authentic.  Just come up with another name. Dont use U2 as title of band. Its Fake.
When John Bonham died in 1980 the greatest rock band in the world, Led Zeppelin,  (yes, they were bigger than U2, ) called it a day and stopped recording and touring as a complete band. Bono needs to show his respect in the same way to Larry. No Larry, no U2.
I couldn't say it better. Thank You.
Bono's ego has been stroked enough since Pop in 1997.
There flushes down Vegas whats left of U2. Which is not much at all after decades of Bono doublespeak. Still - their old music is still execellent, but they can't hold a candle to someone like Roger Waters when it comes to political messages and how to stand for it.
Larry's drumming is integral to the chemistry of the band and vital to the song compositions. I don't have a problem with Vegas residencies per se, especially for older acts, but it is a huge mistake. The Lynyrd Skynyrd cover band of the 2,000s prove you can still make a pile of money with practically no original members. So I think that must be intent. Notwithstanding Bono missing the crowds as he claims.
Is there even anyone who can sound like Larry? I'd be happier if they just had Larry record all his drum parts and they play as a three-piece to his tracks with a video Larry in the background. I mean, U2 has always been at the forefront of concert technology - I can't imagine they'd have much of an issue pulling that off...just an idea. :)
My fear is that this means that Larry's health problems are much worse than they're letting on. :(
Whatever your feelings for U2, and whether it's a smart or good idea to play without their original drummer. Could you at least be NICE about and to the person who has to fill those boots. He's not just "Some fill in guy". He's a person, with feelings. (And, as a fellow Dutchie, I have to say, a damn good musician).
Never thought I would see Rick reach the "old man yelling at clouds" stage, but here we are.
Absolute bollocks!!
Yeah, I've lost all respect for Bono. But I did listen to Boy again last weekend, good memories.
Is it possible the drummer has private reasons for not attending (family issues, personal illness, etc)?   Just a thought. 🫤
Wouldn't it be a matter of contract issues? If they cancel or delay that residency now it's gonna cost them an awful lot? We obviously don't know how everything exactly went, en for how long this will be. And sure, U2 without Larry will never be the same. But as long as it's his choice, and he got the last say in his replacement, so be it.  I've been a U2 fan for decades and have seen them live several times, though I have to admit I was already a bit over them. But that's mostly because of Bono, who has become a caricature  of himself. Maybe they should try to find a replacement for him 😅
I am 100% in agreement. AND I was at that Veteran's Stadium show in 1992 with you! Simply incredible show.   Larry is the heartbeat.
nope. not u2 without all four.
I met Bono twice. The first time was very late at night, back in 2005. I walking down Grafton street after being out drinking in Whelans, must have been 2 or 3 in morning, maybe later, needless to say I was fairly drunk. So I was walking down the road to get the nightlink bus home and there he was walking up the road with a bit of an entourage around him. There use to be a club on Grafton street that all the famous people went to, i forget the name. So me with a big smiley drunken head on me stumble toward him with my hand outstretched and straightaway he walked over to me and shook my hand, I remember he was smiling as well. Have to say I was delighted with that as I'm a big U2 fan.
I am 20. Why can’t I be a fan of an album that’s older than me? Why can’t I attend a show of an album I love? I don’t get the argument here? It’s an amazing album that people love so why not give the fans what they want? The stones do nothing else by the way.
I don't  see the big deal to be honest. Its well known that larry said a few months ago if they toured this year it would be reluctantly without him as he needs surgery. to they decided to tour and he cant play .so what? Id rather see them with three of the members than not at all. how many bands still play without the original line up? Guns n roses, pearl jam, alice in chains, rolling stones,metallica,  etc .the list goes on and on. This drummer will be more the capable of playing the pieces perfect and give the same feel. so why such a rant? Im 47 and following them since 1984. I live 1/2 mile from adam claytons house where the joshua tree album was written and half recorded. Ill fly from Dublin for this and still really enjoy it.
the bigger misstep is rerecording classic songs for Bono's book.
U2 sucks. Just pawns in the political machine for decades now
I'm not a huge U2 fan, but sorry, it's not U2 without Larry. End of story.
Cheap Trick with out Bun E. 🤯
This is a bad choice, but it will always be THEIR choice. Without 25% of their heart and soul? Money must be the driver here. Too bad. 😕👎
They are doing it is not to not disappoint people it's so Bono can buy a new Yacht and a new mansion.
Bands get to determine who's in the band and who's playing the gigs, not fans. Fans get to determine whether to go to the gigs. Either go see them or don't; no reason to get bent out of shape about it.
Like most neighborhoods in West Virginia....it's all relative.  Any time I want to castigate a rich rock star for making a cash grab because, "REALLY?? Don't you already have enough?", I think of the Ecuadorian dude selling flowers out of a bucket at an intersection, looking at all the people in cars that cost more than he'll make in twenty life times thinking, "Really, you needed to spend $90K on a car?  REALLY?".
I'm not sure what's going on with U2 at this point. Please think about interviewing Robert Smith of The Cure.
Band member injured. Get a temporary replacement. So what?  Once the gig starts, not one person is bothered.
My understanding is that they’re helping to launch the new venue. If so, probably not something the owners/backers are willing or able to postpone. I also wonder how long this has been in the pipeline and how contractually bound they are. U2 performing without any member is insane - I don’t think they can be oblivious to that therefore I’m guessing they’ve got little or choice but to go ahead with the original plan.
Bono has a book out……he needs to promote it….this seems to be about the money IMHO
At least they didn't lose their Edge.
U2's decisions like that always make me remember "Casey Kasem with a song dedicated for a little dog named Snuggles", Negativland and some other controversies.
Whoa! You are really off the rails here. Larry Mullen is awaiting surgery. They just hired a replacement. And he is pretty good. You obviously haven't heard the guy play the drums.
my favorite story about Larry was Eno talking about how one time Larry said that a click track was changed by a few BPM- he just ignored him because neither he nor anyone else in the studio could perceive it. But it turned out that Larry was right- his sense of time was so acute he could hear the change in feel just from those couple of BPM difference
Back in 1982, a friend and I were on our way back to Gainesville for school at UF.  We found out that the G. Giles Band was playing in Tallahassee around the same time, so we got tickets.  We got there early and the opening band was really good.  We were blown away by this band and they played three encores.  Then G. Giles played and even before they played a note, J got on the mic and said "we have to fire those guys!  They are impossible to follow."  That band was U2.
Rick, take 30 seconds to look up who their new management are and what their connection is to MSG
It’$ all about the mu$ic, Rick. Ha!  Without Larry they’d still be huge…in European discos and whatnot. Larry is the one who has had to remind them that they’re first and foremost a Rock band, at least until Pop happened.
Lots of great bands move on with one member who is sick,... everyone know that... But is Larry getting a cut of the action as part of the deal?
Can't be much worse than your typical 'remastered' album!
Well, if any member of the band would call the rest of the band on their BS, it’d be Larry, so I’m sure he had to give them the approval. But yeah….weird vibe, for sure!
I doubt most people that will turn up care either way. Maybe I'm just negative but I doubt most fans can name anyone besides Edge and Bono.
"...but not after 43 years." Rick still doesn't acknowledge Iron Maiden. :)
I kind of wish the reason would have been that Mullen said "NO F***ING WAY am I going to play a residence in Las Vegas!" and the band agreed to cover for Larry by scheduling an elective surgery that he'd been planning anyway. How much is the "U2: The Complete Residency Live" box set with a 12" of two new unreleased studio cuts going to cost?
I've been a fan for more than 25 years. I've seen them live two times, and I have all their records twice (CD and LP). They are a huge part of my life's soundtrack.But I also believe that they should have called it a day a long time ago.
Not a die hard U2 fan, but this is a crazy "money grab" by the band. It seems like they don't care about Larry Mullin Jr! It's just about $$$. Sad when bands stoop to this level!
That U2 album from iTunes is absolutely horrific. Hate the band lol
U3
Sometimes enough is never enough.
Sounds like the band is itching to play and doesn't want to wait on Mullin.  Perhaps Mullin is cool with that cuz he knows the boys need the cobwebs dusted NOW or it will be too late.  Voices are a strange thing... maybe Bono is like "if i dont use this now i lose it forever."  Maybe Mullin is OK with that knowing he can dust off quickly after their residency.  Hard telling.  More info from U2 would be cool.
This might be that U2 is keeping a contractual obligation.
Agreed Rick! As a drummer and Larry being my number one influence on me, I will not be going to these shows and I live 2 hours from Vegas. Just a shame. They couldn’t wait another year for him to recover?
I wasn’t a huge fan of the album back then. It’s warmed slightly over the years but not enough for me to give serious money to see it even with Larry playing. Without him, absolutely ZERO chance. Don’t know if you touched on the Songs of Surrender release but that too is another bad step IMHO. I like creativity, I like trying new things. Those songs are just horrible though.
So, Larry is unable to perform in 2023, the band should take a year off?
Zooropa was pretty darn good too!
Larry FOUNDED the damned band.
3 out of 4 members is a rather good %. It's not like it's just Bono, The Edge, or Adam Clayton  and calling it U2. Larry Mullen jr is a kick-azz drummer but... People will be happy seeing them and those that work for them that aren't multi-millionaires will make money.
U 2.  Plus Warm up Wayne Newton. Where they all join in on Donkey Shane. Finish dressed as Elvis. Sell stuff too. Tickets start at only $1000 a seat.  Seriously what a freakin disappointing sell out. Just name it something else
Preach!
Achtung Baby was my first CD ever, that I bought with my own money, as a teenager. I had cassette tapes and LPs of U2, but the CD was new, and it was a huge deal. That album also features One, my favorite U2 song since the first time I listen to the entire album. That was the first song where I was like, wait a minute, this is incredible. So when I heard it was an Achtung Baby tour, and the new sphere with supposed incredible immersive sound, it sounds like something U2 would be into. Their live shows are always spectacles. But it does make you wonder, can some random Dutch guy I've never heard of, do what Larry Mullen Jr does so beautifully...
Shoutout to the Vet! What brought you to Philly back then?
I’ve been a U2 fan since the 80s, a big part of my musical childhood. Seen them twice on the Elevation tour in 2021 and they are great. I’ve always respected them for the fact that it’s always been the same four guys. Only time before now was when Adam got ill before a gig in at a gig in Sydney 1993. I think this is a mistake.
It's their band, they can do what they like let's be honest. Don't go to watch it if you don't like the idea of it; yeah it'll be a bit odd, but I'm sure the shows will be sold out every night anyway.
The sound and nuances of the drums is everything. I realized this when Guns and Roses replaced Steven Adler. This is not good.
I can tell you what they were thinking.................$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
I used to be a huge U2 fan and have seen several shows including the show you mentioned on Oahu.  But bono has proven the type of Illuminati scumbag of person he is, hanging out with the likes of the traitor George Soros who brags about turning in the Jews to the Germans.  Their songs have hidden meanings meant to keep us from following Christ as our savior, and frankly I couldn’t care less what they do.  I’ll never follow or see that again.
I maintain that Zooropa is the best album they ever did. It isn’t a popular opinion and I catch a lot of flack for it, but I stand by that opinion.
Achtung Baby is the only U2 album I really got into.  But even if they had Larry for these shows, the ad campaign was a terrible idea.  It seemed pretentious AF.
They should get a gimmick drummer, like Dave Grohl.  He's everywhere anyway.
Agreed. It's outrageous. It must be some sort of prank, Irish humour. They've made a big deal out of the fact that they've been friends and bandmates since their school years. A band is like a family, all for one and one for all. If this residency is  true, it's a disgrace.
Rolling Stones: those old farts don't know when to quit either...but then they have always had high ticket prices and who are they to turn down a payday? Dragging their  saggy arses on stage again without Charlie.  However, they moved on from Brian Jones, they moved on from Bill Wyman, and they will move on from Charlie, and probably will again after the next one pops off.  Genesis another example.  Depeche Mode probably heading out...from 5, down to 4, down to 3, down to 2.  In a lot of cases, going out while still on top is the better idea. John Deacon carried on with Queen for a while but it is probable he knew the writing was on that wall and decided to close that door.  The surviving two are still propping up nobodies on stage to keep bashing out the hits.
Folk don't care about the drummer.  Watch the ticket sales and see.
It's all marketing b.s.......like the band from their first album....
Achtung Baby. The laser in my Discman burned holes in that disc. It’s like twinkies - I have to limit my intake because it’s probably bad for me in some way to indulge myself to that extent too often.
I thought U2 was Bono and The Edge but I guess I'm not a hardcore fan
Agreed Rick...
The hubris is dripping off this decision.
Maybe they just want to get back on stage. Won't be the same of course but 4 years is a long time to not be playing. Apparently Larry is having issues with his arm. Who knows he might never tour again. So it may just be a case of if they wanna play they have to do it without Larry sadly.
As a long-time fan, U2 doing a residency in Las Vegas tarnishes their legacy more than any of their other missteps in my opinion. Not at least waiting for Larry to heal up and join them from the onset further commoditizes them. What's next, Axl filling in for Bono when he has a cold?
The Rolling Stones still play after even more decades. And they'll be around for many more decades 😂
Maybe the new guy is better than Larry! And tbh, people aren't coming to see LMJ, they're coming for the music, so if the music is good, nobody will care.
I remember when you got a free U2 cassette when ya bought a Walkman…… lol
I believe Larry was fed up with all the political bs....he's not a sellout to the elites like the rest of the band and the corrupt music industry....hope the tour flops.  Independent musicians (eg. Tom MacDonald etc.) is where it's at in todays music scene
Yeah when I heard they were doing the Megasphere shows I assumed that Larry was all healed up. If Larry needs a year to heal I can't believe the band can't shift this to 2024 for his sake.
Only if Garth would play the drums man.
Totally agree with your analysis Rick
Amazing. Considering that Bono is a billionaire with his early investment in Facebook. Does he really need more money?
Well, they lost their wheels at least 20 years ago (as being huge old U2 fan, I would say even 30), and never come back...
What if all the contracts were signed before this guy had his operation ? Maybe they didn't have a way out.
As a big fan of The Who, I totally see your point.
Yeah, agree. I can see where they got this idea from but as you said when Larry's been part of the band so long, it's not right. He's only getting surgery, it's not like he can't come back. They're using the reason as Genesis had in trying to get Peter to come back and tour with them on Turn It On Again (2007) but he had so many projects going, he couldn't do it and so Phil said in response, "Okay, it'll just be the 3 of us." And they could do that because they were that line up including the unofficial member Darryl Struemer (sp?) who'd take over the kit when Phil sang in front. So, yeah, they could switch drummers because Darryl could play just as well as Phil after many years of playing together. The two of them playing drum battles and then in unison. They could go as long as 15 minutes. Anyway, most of this post is Genesis, not U2 but I'm showing contrast. The U2 fans want to see and hear Larry and the band should've waited for him to do this after the surgery. If they booked, they can reschedule, the pandemic lockdowns / restrictions were a PITA but this isn't brand new. They've been doing schedule changes for a few decades now.
Is the new drummer going to tell me who to vote for?
I'm not surprised at all. Larry's always hating touring and the whole "rock star" lifestyle. I remember him saying tongue-in-cheek something along the lines of "Another world tour? Guess I'll buy an island with my cut."  My guess is this surgery is a cover for him not wanting to participate in the venture. Bono is such a narcissist he can't help but exclude the founder for the band for his own selfish promotion.  BTW - fan since the Boy album. Great music! That said - Bono is still a tw@t.
Absolutely right, Rick. Larry Mullen Jr. is U2's Ringo and he has invented a few signature grooves that nobody else could have come up with.
Sooo in essence this is U1. U2-1 = ? Ha!
Doesn't seem like this is worthy of a Rick Rant.  They weren't able to tour during the pandemic and miss performing in front of an audience so they decide to do this residency in Vegas to get back in the groove and give fans an opportunity to see them live.  My guess is they'll follow it up with a tour when he recovers.  Not such a big deal imo but then again I'm not a hardcore fan and haven't been to one of their shows since their 1st US tour when I saw them open for the J Geils Band in San Francisco.  Both bands killed it btw.
I saw U2 in 1985 and 1987 and never saw them after that as they got to full of themselves over the years.
Agreed.
The MSG Sphere holds less than 20K people, and Joshua Tree Tour -- which was a huge money maker -- was in stadiums. It'll be interesting to see what the tickets cost, but it's not a long residency, and Joshua Tree tix sold out in seconds and I, even as a fan club member, could only get nosebleed seats in Levi Stadium trying to buy tickets the *second* they went on sale.
Thank you for your words
This is so disrespectful I could not believe it at first. Larry Mullen can't play the gigs because of health issues. It's not up to you, me or anybody than the band members themselves who should play those shows. I personally think Mullen is OK with this. The man you so disrespectfully call "some stand-in guy" is Bram van den Berg, a well respected, professional drummer from the Netherlands. He's the drummer for the succesfull alternative rock band Krezip, who had a number of hits and regularly play venues like the famous Pinkpop festival. The guy graduated from the Rock Academy in Tilburg. It'll be hard enough for him temporarily stepping in for Larry Mullen Jr, but it's also an opportunity that not many musicians are given. Give the guy a break.
Agree 💯%!!!
Not the Beatles, but an incredible simulation!
They’ve sucked ever since they did that song Elevation. They became the Tom Cruise of jumping the shark fame. They drank their own cool-aid. I loved Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum. But this had been going on for a long time Rick.
I have never like u2 since realizing Bono is a fascist and a sell out to the WEF.
As if a band as big as U2 needs an ad in the middle of the Super Bowl. They don't need the publicity to sell out the stadium. Some bands are so far up themselves they become detached from reality. They have done some great records over the years but Bono for one is a massive hypocrite.
I saw them in late 1987 in Tempe, AZ. B.B. King was the opener. It was an Amazing Concert! I liked some of U2‘s albums, War and The Joshua Tree in particular. But, their later stuff I just never got into. I mean no disrespect to those albums, but they just didn’t do anything for me for some reason. But the whole forcing the Songs of Innocence album to every iTunes user was way too much. For people who never heard of U2, or don’t like them to have an album foisted on them with what could be interpreted as homoerotic cover artwork was a bad decision. Not the way to win new fans, and it was offputting to a mild fan like me.
"How much is enough?" Yup. I wonder that all the time.
U2 just became Us3
mount temple
Let me play Devil's Advocate for a moment here: would you have the same problem if Larry Mullen Jr. had passed away? Bands, and particularly older bands, tour all the time with replacements for "irreplaceable" members - Led Zeppelin without John Bonham, The Who without Keith Moon. If the rest of the band want to keep on going but one member doesn't do you simply expect the whole band to retire? Storm in a teacup, much ado about nothing.
You hit the nail on the head, as always. I've been a fan for decades but have never seen them live (sadly missed that Aloha Stadium gig you mentioned). When I heard about the LV gigs, I thought…hmm, maybe. But after hearing Larry wasn't going to be playing, hard no for me.
It reminds me of that old joke. What’s the difference between Bono and Jesus? Jesus knows he’s Christ.
I heard Larry had a surgery ... but I still would have postponed the gig!
U2 have played without Adam Clayton for a few gigs and everything turned out ok. They will get by without Larry while he recovers from surgery. Everyone relax, don't do it, even when you want to rant through it ✌️
Hopefully Larry is not having any health issues.
April Fools' Day comes early this year
100% agree. Wouldn't have ever seen Rush without Neil. Huge U2 fan. No reason for this unless they think they'll get NEW fans who don't care who the drummer is. Ugh
You seem to be making a lot of assumptions here. Maybe I'm missing something, but couldn't it be that they're under contract and Larry Mullen Jr's need for surgery unexpectedly conflicted with that? I mean, there are other explanations besides the whims of a bone-headed manager.
I'm sure this Vegas residency will be just as successful as Spider Man: Turn Off the Dark.
I'm sure the fill in guy will have the time of his life 😅
If you want material for 'What are you thinking?', how about Roger Waters re-recording Dark Side of the Moon just to spite David Gilmour. Talk of cutting the nose to spite the face.
In my opinion the fifth and sixth member of the band are Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno. Whether or not they were involved has been a decent indicator if a U2 album is good or not, ever since they first collaborated. So, the fans can only be number seven.
As a bass player I hate to admit it -  ALL drummers and bass players are expendable (exceptions: ones who are lead singers and  Flea).  Look at the Stones. ZZ Top. The Who(!) If THE WHO can carry on without Moon and Entwistle,  ANYONE can scrub their rhythm section.
I’m still looking forward to seeing them.
Um it's really no big deal.  He will be back for the true tour which will be tons and tons of shows.  People are making way too big of a deal about this.  And this is coming from a longtime fan who has seen them a million times starting back on The Joshua Tree tour.
Appreciate your opinion. The manager, and the band, are big boys and made the decision to play.  Larry opted to hang at home.  I’m excited to see them perform.
Hahaha go get them Rick.
Understandable, though listening to this makes me feel a bit sorry for Dutch drummer Bram van den Berg, who will replace Mullen and can't wait to play with the band. He's been a huge U2 fan since he was a kid, so it's a once in a life-time dream come true.
2013 - Bon Jovi should've called it quits!
Larry is a one of a kind drummer who ads something totally unique to the band. Has to be there.
Spot on. 💯
U 1 and a half.....
They want to play live, what's the problem?
Sorry, but this is a ridiculous rant.  Contracts were signed, the gig was set, and Larry had to pull out for medical reasons--and for that you give the band grief?  Time to get priorities in order.  99.9% of fans will get over it 1 song into the show, as they should.  Now, if you named the replacement drummer and showed us he was a hack, then sure, rant away.  But I'm pretty sure U2 can get anyone they want for this gig.  He'll be more than fine.
Nope, this is the ultimate betrayal. Either quit altogether or wait until Larry has healed. Been a fan for nearly 40 years, but I can't live with this.
Look at what happened to Genesis when they put out a post Phil Collins album. To me, Phil was the voice of Genesis. Two decades after the fact, I gave the album a chance. Calling All Stations is not bad. The only thing wrong with it IMO, is that they called themselves Genesis.
I agrée, but the Stones have made an industry of replacement. For goodness sakes, Ronnie Wood is a replacement, to say nothing of Munch and now Steve Jordan.  As a drummer and a U2 fan, I’m not sure if I’d be less or more interested in seeing them without Larry - what would another drummer bring? Same arrangements, or reinvigorated tunes? - as a novel idea, but U2 isn’t really U2 without Larry. Plus, Vegas? Achtung Baby? The whole package is a likely pass for me.
U2: The Money Tour 2023
Everyone is entitled to their opinion but I think it's a little overblown. They are in their 60's. If one of them can't perform and the rest want to, then they should play. How many more times will they play? I'm sure they will sound great and and it will be a good show. I also think many fans might not even notice.
Not the first time Larry Jr has said enough... this was on the cards for quite some time and to be fair Larry has been quite disillusioned with the band for over a decade.
Maybe Larry gave U2 his blessing to go on without him
The Beatles toured with a fill in drummer when Ringo was sick. If they could do it, I see no reason why U2 couldn’t.
what I have read was that the replacement  drummer was only for  a view shows in vegas ! until Larry is back! .
I was also at the Vet stadium show too!!
U2's marketing with the sphere is unfortunate timing. Larry needing to recover from drumming-related surgery...fine. i'm excited about an Achtung Baby-related tour. Now, the bad: they are touring AB coinciding with the release of Songs of Surrender, a mellow acoustic reimagining (that has disappointed fans with the first three singles)...that does nothing to hype up the AB tour (which was all about excess). The 3-minute ad is slow and boring, which makes me worry about the shows. It does not make me curious. The floating sphere is not weird (though fodder for people looking to take a jab and tie it to the spy balloons)...just boring. AB/Zooropa was them at their most energized, creative, and intetesting. This ad, Surrender, no Larry...WTFU2? Please, review the Surrender series so far. Maybe you can shed some light on the reimaginings of Pride, With or Without You, and One (released during the Super Bowl. They don't have Guy (Madonna's manager) anymore, but is this the work of the new one?
W0W!
"Larry Mullen Jr. is not playing with U2......My buddy Rich...."
As a fan of the band, I think you said it all... "Really???"...
If Mullen Jr.'s unable to participate because of recent surgeries, don't you think he'd be on board to join the performances once he's fully recovered?
I cat believe the News today…To use the same businesses model as record industry days is perhaps not very fashionable- But lateral thinking may provide interesting content / new ideas  Keep up the sterling work old chap
I do think the whole thing is a little weird but I understand why it’s Achtung Baby. That was the last U2 show I saw and everything about it had a very Las Vegas vibe.
some fill in guy? Blunder? haha, maybe you're in for a surprise...anyway, if Larry can't do it, why not? Don't see the problem...Obviously, they're not in it only for the money. Let them hear the crowd roar again. I see only comments of people saying, I've seen them here, I saw them there...what about the people who never saw those guys playing live. With all respect but U2 is bigger than Larry...
Stop being so hard on them. Rent is due, mortgages are due. They don’t pay themselves. You gotta man up and work. I’m sure Larry will be collecting some disability or something. Can’t say I’m away of what one can only call the U2 HR machine.
Gotta disagree. This is just a fill-in, right? And it's Vegas, not a stadium tour. More power to them, I say.
Krezip is a great band. And i was very surprised to hear this. Perhaps we Will be surprised!
I don't care at all. Never liked U2 😅
Good points Rick.
Hmm, now they’re U 1.5.
Agree 100%
I still say to this day. My favorite concert ever was U2 The Unforgettable Fire Tour May 1985 . Can't imagine them without Larry.
Spot-on, Rick.✌️😎
Shrunk warhawk Elvis is boring lame embarrasing predictable and all the way irrelevant and out of touch
Who's the substitute drummer?
Rick, they're blowing it.  I have to wonder if it's purely a contractual thing.  Is there an asterisk in a contract that they signed years ago that Larry also signed that says, "The performances can only be cancelled if Bono can't perform"....?  I can't believe it, man.  It's just nuts.  I'd way rather see them hang it up.  Larry has had physical problems for a while.  As a drummer, I knew something was up in recent concert footage where his drum throne was very, very high.  I suspect the audience will be full of people who a) aren't hardcore fans, or b) haven't had the chance to see them before.  I hate seeing U2 "go out" like this.  I'll gladly take the 2017 Joshua Tree shows (I saw the show twice) as my last U2 shows.  I was lucky enough to see Songs of Innocence tour once, as well as the 360 Tour twice (including the Rose Bowl show that they made a DVD of).  I was at the last Rush show in LA.  Neil was ready to stop.  Geddy and Alex were not.  But they knew Rush is those 3 guys.  Heck, U2 is even more those 4 guys than Rush is those 3 guys!  But Rush knew that meant Rush was over that night.
Does anybody Know how you’re supposed to know when Your fingertip should mute The string above and when not cause I’ve seen both done at different times
The one lick that he plays all of the time shouldn't be hard to replace, but it is HIS lick to be playing. Strange when bands do this on one hand, but $$$ isn't hard to understand
lol "we don't like to let people down"...  Sorry U2 has always come off as not 'genuine' to me and has become more corporate as years go on, doing a Las Vegas residency has to do w/ more than 'letting fans down', starts w/ a 'C' ends w/ an 'H', with a whole lot of 'ass' in the middle :P
They are like Springsteen these days.  A lounge act.  Pathetic.
I appreciate you referring to the replacement only as 'some other drummer.'
Btw I hope you do a video about Bacharach (who we just lost) compositions
Bono should have just been truthful: “They made us an offah we no canna refuse.”  It’s all about money!
It’s funny and ironic how the Las Vegas Sphere is opening the same year while the US is playing Space Invaders with Spy UFO’s.
I saw U2 at Elland Road, Leeds UK, July 1st 1987, I was 17.  It was one of the best gigs of my my life.  Now I'm 53 tomorrow, and it's STILL is one of the best gigs I've ever seen.  I've never seen them again.  Perhaps, if they are going to do this BS, I never will.  U2 without Larry?  Give me a break, thats not U2 imho.
Loyalty is no longer a commodity. Hopefully Larry will enjoy the uptick in royalties from the resurgence.
Who really gives a squirt?  As a long time fan of U2, They can do whatever they want. The Grateful Dead still sells out with 3 original members.  Business is business.  Sometimes it’s bad, sometimes it’s good.  For U2, it’s Good Bu$iness😎
Agree, fan since Live Aid.  I would not attend.
They’re Running to Stand Still without Larry
Being a huge Rush fan, I immediately think to myself that this would be like Geddy and Alex performing without Neil. Aside from the Taylor Hawkins tribute where multiple drummers sat in, these guys have had the decency to honor Neil by not doing something like that. Couldn't they have put this on hold until LMJr had recovered?
You really don't expect a band as big as U2 to 'dep' any member for any significant gig...surely?
Isn’t this what bands typically do after 40 years? Give them a break.
Do this to an important band member like Mullen, and you may find hard times ahead. What goes around comes around. Think Yes without Jon Anderson, then without Chris Squire, etc.
Larry’s got a back issue that requires surgery. I’m sure this ok with all parties.  He will be back with the band when the new studio album drops late 2023/2024
Naaa WTF?!? They‘re finally on the road to hitting rock-bottom with this move. Larry is the heart of U2‘s sound, he has to be on stage, that’s ridiculous ! Fans haven‘t forgotten about 2014, they won‘t forgive THIS!! 🤬 That‘s a proper sellout and nothing else.
This is what Robert Plant told Jason Bonham about replacing his father John in Led Zepplin;  "It doesn’t matter how great you are on the drums, Jason. I love you to bits, and you play absolutely amazing. But John was the drummer in Led Zeppelin, and John was part of me and Jimmy and John Paul. We shared something very, very special.'”  So there's someone who gets what being band mates is all about.
The Police were OG and make U2 look like dicks 👏🤘✌️ agree Rick🇦🇺
Hey Rick ~ I fully agree with you. They certainly can wait until Larry is recovered enough to play. I wouldn't go see them until he's back with them.
Many think U2 rhythm section is mediocre
U2 playing a few shows with a fill in doesn't bother me in the least. Bands have fill ins all the time.
I'm not a U2 fan so I couldn't care less. To me, he's just the drummer in the band. And drummers get replaced very easily. You mentioned the Beatles, they did a part of a tour in 64 or 65 without Ringo at the height of Beatlemania and when it was done, he came back and kicked ass again. If their drummer is getting surgery, I'm sure he's okay with these shows taking place without him because I'm sure he's getting paid too. I don't see the what the big deal is here.
The last U2 album that I consider myself as "listenable" is "All That You Can't Leave Behind". So, it was a long, long time
The only thing that could preserve U2's integrity at this point is if LMJ comes out publicly and supports this move otherwise shame on Bono for pandering to the almighty buck.
Bono - and, y'know, we, um, really need the $$$....
He had 3 YEARS to have this surgery. Waits until NOW to get it done?
I feel sorry for the new guy, i am sure he is awesome and super nice and will get paid, but..... I watched Antonio Sanchez play a u2 song today, was amazing
I didn't become a U2 fan until Achtung Baby when I thought they stopped trying to be important and started making good pop music...until then I mostly tolerated them.
Thank you for your Video Rick.  I‘m a huge U2 and in particular Achtung Baby Fan since EVER, that is the band that connects me and my dad (carpenter and fan since 1987 btw).  I grew up with U2 I saw them 2017 in Berlin, I wish I would have been able to see them 1992 in Kiel on ZooTV Tour but unfortunately I am born in 2000. Anyway, I’m 101% your opinion and I am disappointed. I was hoping they may do a celebration of Achtung baby in some way but this isn’t the right way. 3/4 of U2 isn’t enough, Larry and his style of drumming is fundamental.  I just don’t know what to say.
they were a great band once but went on far too long IMO
From what I heard, U2 wanted to be the 1st perform at the Sphere. Someone should have checked their ego and let Larry heal well enough to play & tour again before scheduling a tour.
Jimmy Nichol available ???
Drummers are usually the first to suffer with age, due to the physical demands. Mullen is 61.
Probably because Achtung Baby was the last decent album U2 made and Larry Mullen Jr I'm sure disagrees with doing a Las Vegas residency because anyone knows that's where artist's go to die !
Bono is friends with eat the bugs.
Greed is a terrible thing.
Bad gig, bad timing for the commercial. $$$ 👽
I would'nt play with a worldleader-lover either...
The Joshua Tree was my last U2 album. I just felt it was the perfect album and I didn’t need anymore from that band.
They couldn't pass up the opportunity of a residency at LV Sphere. They will sell out every show at ridiculously high ticket prices. That's really why they are doing it.
The Stones played without Charlie Watts, what’s the difference with U2? And yes I am a drummer…
I have a lot of respect for you Rick, but have to disagree with you on this one. U2 has been under contract to do these gigs for a while now. As you know, you can’t just walk away from a contract, even if you are a rich rock and roll band. And the temporary drummer, Bram, is not replacing Larry. He is just filling him for him for these 10-12 gigs at the MSG Sphere in Las Vegas. Larry is still very much the drummer of U2, and the band has confirmed this.  U2 has always pushed the envelope and done things differently. Achtung Baby was a perfect example of this. Unforgettable Fire was another. The MSG Sphere gigs will be another example. People have been calling for U2 to call it a day since 1984. Thankfully, they haven’t listened.
I agree Rick, some bands change line ups a lot and that's cool (happens a huge amount in jazz of course) but some bands remain the same. And when a band remains the same for long enough, it becomes a part of their identity, you can't imagine them any other way - Beatles, Zep, Queen, U2 spring most readily to mind. I think they should re-schedule gigs for when Larry is well.
Gr8 commentary!  😁
don't care.. never liked them anyway
Really funny to see that we Dutch people and media are really proud that a Dutch drummer is going to play with U2. But from a U2 fan perspective I can fully understand your criticism.
Saw their very first show in North American in1980 at The Ritz in New York City. I guess I'm like that first example.
From documentaries (including Rattle and Hum) and interviews I’ve seen, Larry and Adam have always been the more conservative members of the band. I think it’s Larry is older, his health isn’t great, and he’s just like “fook it. I made my bag. Let me retire” while the rest of the band wants to still do stuff. It’s a fair compromise if it preserves their friendship
I’ve been a fan since the summer of ‘82. Their video Gloria was on rotation during MTV’s infancy, and I found their sound intriguing. I’m not against people making some bank by doing things like this, but U2 is special and doing it without LMJ is not a good idea. I’m guessing the suits may have them by the gonads over this.
Spot on! Sadly to some bands, money means more than integrity...
Larry is fantastic and a foundation of the sound of course, but many people won’t even notice sadly.
U2 ??? Long gone.  Noel Gallagher is far better. U2 hasn't released anything decent for years. Bono It's all about the $$$$$$ I saw U2 with NGHFB. U2s sound was crap, to much lo-fi I almost threw up. To many backing tracks and Noel Gallagher was not allowed to sell merchandise.. Go away U2
I agree Rick... i'm 51 and this is not a good move. They're becoming just like every other run of the mill band. It's sad.
I'll be 62 in March and have been a huge U2 fan since 'Boy' in 1980.  I think this is a mistake along with the recent release of re-imagined songs.  One of the best things about them is that they've had the same lineup their entire career.  It's silly to break this string just for a pay day.
It’s always a sad moment when your heroes sellout. The defiance of youth gives way to the greed of old age.
They're doing a residency in Vegas without Larry, they're a Cabaret band.
Is Larry dying? I don't know. Without the original four members, to me its just a tribute band. And Bono makes me sick.
Who in gods names would consider Unforgettable Fire a failure? Maybe sales wise at the time but that’s unreal.
Buddy Rich was a huge U2 fan?
Wow, I did not know! Terrible is my takeaway of this. Been a fan for så long I can´t remember, but I must admit it took a while before I was hooked. Sad 😞
Touring and playing in front of people isn't a part of my musical life; Nobody could do it like U2 though. I've been to a U2 concert; that kind of thing enhances your soul for eternity. They are just something special, the likes of which we will never see again.   I don't like Vegas, I'm not a Vegas kind of guy; I don't do coke anymore, I never did H*kers, I hate gambling, or being roofied and robbed. But, I hope to see it on video in YouTube!
Wouldn’t watch U2 without Larry. I’ve pre-ordered their new album with reimagined songs. I liked the song as how they were originally so nervous that this is not going to be good. A good manager knows when to say no to the band!
Sadly 0.001% of their Las Vegas audience will notice if they have a different drummer.
Playing with pre-recorded tracks is ok but playing with another drummer is not? It's nosense. Both cases are absolute lie.
Larry has medical problems and needs to get better first before playing again.
Amazing Album!!! It is not U2 without Larry. I agree with you Rick. 🤘😎
Spot on Rick, I love Achtung Baby so much because of the drum sounds and percussion. It’s unlike anything they had done prior to that record.
Bono is too pre occupied with being a wannabe elite, rubbing shoulders with all the parasitic class on a regular basis.
Yeah, man. Been listening since '80 or whenever. As an ex-drummer I was into them for their grooves, as for me it was Peart, Copeland, Mullen, Collins, and Bonham.  I wouldn't be interested in seeing a cash grab without Mullen. It would feel all Beach Boys 1980.  Oh, and it's "Mullen" not "Mullin" just in case you want to correct it in the description.
It was big news here in the Netherlands. The "fill in guy" is Dutch. Of course, when the Beatles did their one and only show in the Netherlands they did it without Ringo...
1M % agreed! I first saw them at the US Festival circa 1983…no Larry Mullins Jr. No band. Show some loyalty.
I saw them in 2001 and found that to be their performance peak…kinda with Rick see Rush living members not touring as Rush
Bono probably needs the money.....
I *thought* I was a big U2 fan until I saw this commercial. Didn’t even know this album existed. Not that it’s a bad album, but even people like me who grew up learning guitar from U2 songs doesn’t even know this album… I wouldn’t go to that residency
The lure of the almighty dollar is responsible for many dumb decisions.  This is one of them.  What's next?  A Stones tour without Mick Jagger?
Good thing their name isn't U4, or it would be a serious case of false advertising.
I never thought U2 is someone’s favorite band. They have as much harizma as Bryan Adams 😁
There are a few songs I do like from U2 but I am not a huge all round fan. I worked with a guy who was and when I hear things like this I think of him and how this will affect him. He was such a huge fan, he followed the band on tour on every UK tour they did and also over to Europe and the US several times. I can understand the rant but I'm hoping of all hope that the band had a full discussion about this without just going off without all the original members.
Rick, did you see babyface playing right handed guitar as a lefty. Playing all the chords backwards
I love U2. And can't believe I'm saying this. But there is no way I'd go see them for that show. I saw them in 2017 for the Joshua Tree Tour. And their first song that night is burned in my memory. Larry Mullen, Jr walked out on stage, by himself, and kicked off Sunday Bloody Sunday. How could U2 do a show without him? Well, they can't. Because it's not U2 without any one of those band members. Period.
Bono told Larry (With or With-Out You) we are going to get another big bag!
There’s more to it.   Larry needs surgery.   And it seems their bringing in a sun has more to do with their having to meet a contractual obligation.   The venue is new. It has some great technology to it. It’s perfect for a ZOOTV tribute.   But the venue only opens once. And they contracted U2 to do it.   To pass it up could be a contractual nightmare.    I don’t like the idea of them playing without any member.   But I get it under the circumstances.
Great points Rick.  I agree, this is a mistake.  I have no idea why they would play without Larry.  And yes, Rattle and Hum to me is a great record. It was not a misstep. Rolling Stone hated on it, but that magazine hasn’t been decent in decades.
It's all about the money!
It's about the venue - MSG Sphere. They could wait but someone else would be the first with a new kind of experience
I think Larry would have wanted to play but he couldn’t. He did say that in an interview prior. Yeah it’s sad he’s not playing in this show.
Most arrogant band I know.
I still can’t delete their album on my iPhone. I have tried and tried and it keeps coming back. Last week I got in my car to drive somewhere, I had been listening to my last album on my previous journey, and lo and behold that effing U2 album came on when I started the engine! I was not, and am not amused!!!!!
I agree with a lot of that Rick but should the Stones deny their fans or love of playing because Charlie is gone? STP still touring without Scott Weiland. Imaging if the Allman Brothers stopped after Duane died.
Seeing the faces of their fans is secondary. Needing cash to continue funding the lifestyles they're accustomed to is the primary focus.
It’s not like they didn’t have to take a pause when Bono had that bike wreck 5 or 10 yrs ago.  Maybe do an acoustic show at the least, but to replace Larry…. SMDH.   Let’s hope this doesn’t turn out to be like Jon Anderson and Yes.
Ummmm, NO, NO, NO, NYET, AND HELL TO DA NO! I have been a HUUUUUUUGE fan of U2 for nearly 40 years! LARRY MULLEN, JR was THE MAIN REASON why I took to U2. His drumming is DA SH**! No slights against Bono, The Edge, and Adam Clayton, BUT LARRY'S THE MAN!  To each his or her own, but I would not be interested in seeing U2 perform or recording an album without Larry. That's a BIIIIIIG deal breaker FOR ME. 😐☹️😠💔
It's hard to imagine seeing them without all four members. However, the only time I've seen them live it was in an arena with the worst sound imaginable. I was in the nosebleeds and it was all reverb from the roof bouncing back and mixing with the PA, so... what's the difference?
All you can do is call it how you see it...  hahaha
U2 have played once without all 4 members in the whole of there history. 1993 when Adam was too pissed/hungover. This led to him calling time on his alcohol addiction.   U2 without Larry just isn’t U2.
If the drummer doesn’t want to do it. I don’t see the problem.    He doesn’t like playing sane sings over and over
It´s strange yes. I do get it, and I won´t pay the ful price, let alone sick dynamic pricing tickets… would have flown from Europe to see them if Larry was there, maybe even with dynamic pricing…
“Some fill in drummer” sounds terribly degrading to the professional they will put in Larry’s place. There are many drummers that can do the same as Larry Mullen Jr.
Agreed Rick! Shame on them!😮
Thank you for your input. Myself, I find that it would be a let-down to not have their original drummer, since he is still alive and presumably still the same good drummer as he used to be. Never mind, I am not likely to go there. But if I were, the lack of their original drummer would dampen the experience, since I have seen his charismatic presence.
I hope it goes well for them, but to me, this has the makings of the biggest misstep U2 has ever made.
The fulcrum of this event is the VENUE.  The MSG Sphere is going to be incredible.  That's why U2 is doing this, not because of the fans.
Complete madness
In defence of U2, if they don’t do the residency it would be another 12 to 18 months before Larry is ready to go. That’s a long time to be out of the public eye and they aren’t getting any younger. They played without Adam once and everything went well.
U2 without LMJr is not U2. Their band is about chemistry between the 4 of them. Without Larry they are a cover band.
Well said Rick 👏👏
The Stones- love 'em, but enough already...
Tell 'em Brother. Say it as it is!!!
You also forgot that REDICULOUS Spider-Man musical.
Maybe Bono's saving up for new shades and needs the gig. A man's gotta make a buck.
Totally agree. Was excited to see them until I found out Larry isn’t going to be there. Feels like a cash grab. I would be willing to wait an extra year or two for a new album and Larry.
Well said! No Larry, no U2!
Larry Mullin or bust baby!  Plus, I would not pay top dollar prices without that iconic drumming
So I take it you’re not going to interview Bono anytime soon?
People need to calm down. Larry Mullen Jr. is only temporarily out of the running due to health issues. And temporary replacements of band members are nothing new. U2 isn't doing anything that so many other bands haven't already done before.
good call
Reworking old songs and now this? I'm with you, Rick, no Larry, no U2.
Money
Wonder how Larry feels about it?
I'm sure Larry is as upset as us fans, if he could do the shows he would. Enjoyable video though, your passion for U2 is clear to see! The pride of Ireland 🇮🇪👌
They should have a screen behind them with Larry cussing and insulting them the whole time for this stupid idea
The real name of the band U2 is the "Larry Mullins Jr. Band" and we ALL know this.
I've seen U2 many times– amazing live band– and I wouldn't be as excited to see them without Larry. But if he needs to take a break and the others want to do it without him, I don't see why it's a problem.
I'd rather go see Half Man Half Biscuit perform Achtung Bono than listen to U2 without Larry.
Larry has made it clear that he doesn’t like playing their hits he feels like a jukebox I can definitely see him not wanting to do it
♥
Whaaat?
For the right money, I'm sure Jimmy Nichol would be available.
It's ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS....
The band that overstayed its welcome for the past 25 years, running purely on Bono's thermonuclear ego and iTunes promo.
Springsteen actually stepped in for Bono when Bono had his accident
Bono is a pure Satanist; you can forget U2!
YouTube drummer is sick of their hits and sick of playing them he’s been complaining about that forever I can’t see him even wanting to do it
To be fair, U2 hasn't been relevant since maybe Pop
Been a fan since 1980. Also 62.
I’m sure Larry wants them to do it. Kinda lame to make a call out video with the leverage your channel has. Even if it doesn’t impact sales it will get people talking crap
Not only did they put an album I didn’t want, they wiped all the music I had on my then iphone 4s.
They are thinking. It’s a money grab! No new music. Let’s play an album that is 30 years old, without our drummer.
It is strange. Can’t believe they are playing without him! At the same time if Larry is good with it, I suppose it’s okay. Will have to see how it goes over.
He's probably sick to death of Bono's crap .
Is attendance at these shows obligatory?
As a guy from The Netherlands myself...i'm wondering how U2 came up with this unknown Dutch guy as well!
Rick, what are YOU thinking bud ... ???
U2 have stopped being a rock band for some time now. Not sure there is any passion left there. Ughhh..the more I listen the more I get annoyed. Everything seems like a cash grab these days. A reach for past glory. They are so living in the past that there is just nothing fresh at all from them. Sad what happened to what was my favorite band.
He's not vaxxed can't enter USA
U2 haven't had a proper thought since Bono put on sunglasses 🕶️ lol
Songs of Innocence is bangin ngl
U2 copied the drumming style of Stone Roses on Achtung Baby
It was Mount Temple school
I walked into a Tower records when October came out. I was transfixed and it didn't leave my turntable for 4 months. Been a big U2 fan ever since. Well, until the 90s. But they were the real deal. Saw them in the 80s in front of 150,000 at the US festival and then in front of 80,000 people.
I saw U2 in Gateshead in 1980 supporting The Police and 11 times since. Its unacceptable to play without Larry but, even worse, a Las Vegas residency? You're fucking kidding me.
I guarantee the tickets to those LV shows are going to be ridiculous.
During the sting interview I have a feeling Rick and Sting were speaking of them….thoughts?
the school Is called mount temple also rick I reckon it's their pension fund
What a waste of money, nobody makes money back from the Super Bowl ads.
Bonobo knows what he's doing.
Its U2…only iOS can have the show
My thoughts exactly. LMJ stared the band!!!!!!!!!
I am really looking forward for that concert. I have been a fan since I remember, actually I was in that concert in Honolulu in 2006, there was a marathon the next day and I had to sleep on the beach because I couldn’t find a hotel. Nice memories.
The best album ever.
They haven't been good in 30 years
Bono is a weirdo.
U2 aren’t thinking!
