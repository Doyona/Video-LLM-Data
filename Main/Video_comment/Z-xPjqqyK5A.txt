德約在2010年Davis cup final 迎來生涯轉折，23年的辛納亦如此
e fu così che da quel giorno Jannik non ne perse più una con il buon Nole😀
quel giorno Djokovic ha capito che non c'era più trippa per gatti
E da qui cominciò la scalata , e nello stesso tempo l'astio di Djokovic nei confronti di Sinner.
Da riguardare ogni tanto e ringraziarlo.❤
that was a real turnpoint
Sincerely hope that people don’t forget they have such a great champion…instead of turning their backs so quickly 🫠🥹
Non ci credo che non vuole giocare la finale!!!!
la fine dello zingaro
The start to the end of essentially everyone else…
The match that flipped the Djokovic-Sinner rivalry
Jannik ❤❤❤
Da questo giorno, esattamente da questo giorno, è cambiato tutto.
This match changed history. Is a turning point for Sinner. He knew he could beat Djokovic.
Grande Jannik 🙌🙌🙌🏆🏆🏆👏👏👏
È qui che il vigliacco ha iniziato ad odiarti,qui li hai fatto capire che sei tu ora il numero uno è non più lui.
This is where the Djokovic downfall began! ❤️❤️❤️
Da li djokovic ......
La classe di Sinner non ha eguali. Avrebbe battuto Djockovic anche nel suo tempo migliore. Nettamente più forte l'italiano. Solo la Wada poteva fermarlo con una squalifica Vergognosa.
MASTERPIECE ..........here he wrote the HISTORY of ITALIAN TENNIS!!!!
Fantastic Sinner!! Number 1❤❤❤
DESTROYED PEPELAUGH
Without doubt, the most painful loss of nole's entire career !!!
I’m convinced this was the match that ignited Sinner’s confidence which led to his incredible 2024 season.
Iconic match
😂now novak Djokovic's  gave regret to giving tips to sinner coach to improve his game.he is just a fool.why he give to good tips.now  sinner use his tricks and tips to beat him.
This is the turning point of Sinner's career...
Sinner & Alcaraz sont les seuls à pouvoir inquieter Djokovic.Sans eux,on ne parlerait plus jamais de big 3.Malgré son palmarès est complet,on continue le débat ''Qui est le Goat?Je pense que Nadal et fed en signe de reconnaissance devrait honnorer ces deux jeunes talents.Comme on n'a cessé de comparer Messi à Ronaldo.
Che capolavoro, grande Jannik 🎾🎾🎾🎾🎾
fit sinner can beat everyone in the tour
JUICED UP SINNER
Sinner the winner 🏆
Its special representing your country in anything sports.
3:24
0-40 It's a nightmare...for the rest of your life...
yannik singled handidly won Davis cup for iTaly!
Djokovic a son niveau il gagne sinner hein
Grandissimo . Campione!
This is where Sinner got Djokovic' number.
This match turned the tide of Sinner vs Djokovic from now on. This match did more damage to Joker more than the AO 2024.
Domani così, ma per almeno tre set. Poi possiamo anche perdere la finale...
Domani mattina ci divertiamo io personalmente ho visto nei primi 5 turni un Jannik ragioniere molto calcolatore domani credo che vedremo un Sinner molto aggressivo come a Malaga e basterà
Sinner is the reason I started playing tennis. He transmits passion, dedication, humility. He is a born champion. I believe he is the only one who can counter the leadership of Djokovic and Alcaraz
Al posto di Djokovic, avrei preferito Alcaraz venerdì in semifinale
Non ce la faccio ... troppi ricordi!😂
The day I realized Djokovic is not really strong.  All his knows is to enter the head of his adversers before winning.  So the moment you stop Novak Djokovic from anticipating your hits, he becomes so weak 😂
Almost a month later, I'm still in awe of what this young man accomplished. Such a brilliant and fearless personality,  you gotta love Jannik 🦊
Supposed GOAT of tennis.. How many ppl hate djokovic man?
Nole: "inculassort!"
Forza sinner  viva l' italia
Abbiamo trovato un campione formidabile. Grazie Jannik!❤
Wait--- 3 match points? Not shown in Italy utub of course.
And this is just the beginning...vai Jannik, vai!
There are various stages in the game it felt to me like Djokovic was letting Sinner win. Out of brotherly love, so I imagine.
Il sorriso di Jannik 😊❤
Fantastic Sinner! It's beautiful to see the egomaniac spoiled serbian boy loosing for his country.
❤❤
immenso Jannik
Italia di santi carbonerie poeti navigatori numeri uno in tutto
Non so quando, comunque JANNIK diventerà il numero uno della classifica mondiale ATP
Sinner stepped up and did it for Italy. Great to see this.
Sinner is a master. He has enormous power, speed and precision. He can defeat anyone. He only needs to work on his confidence (psychology) when playing Djokovic or any big player.
Huge respect for Nole, we love him in Italy but...what a game by Jannik ❤
haha serbs
Sinner looks so lean and leaner than djokovic with power
Sinner is 2/3 vs Djokovic in his last 3 but I bet he'd exchange his 2 for Djokovic's 1.   It's encouraging for Sinner but when it matters most Djokovic won't drop match points and lose.
Sinner will be put in his place soon.
Sinner’s got Djokovic’s number 😊
I cant believe, he was flying to win in thec3rd..... then.. choke 0x40.. than lost his serve to loose 5/7.... Teory of conspiration on Novak.. Final in Italy, hum.. Lots of pressure to Sinner win.
I'm here only to see the 3 consecutive match point failed by Djokovic. And there aren't.
Keep rewatching this and enjoy every single time
l'Italia come una fenice è capace di risorgere dalle ceneri come l'europeo di calcio del 2020 ed ora in coppa Davis.
Big congratulations to Sinner.  But don't forget, Novak has almost perfectly demonstrated his wonderful skills in 2023.  He reached the finals of all four Grand Slams and won three championships. He won a record-breaking seventh championship at the year-end. The number of weeks he spent at the top of the world exceeded 400. He is 36 years old this year and can continue to write many records. record.  At his age, in such condition, and with his performance throughout the year, he can still compete against these young, powerful and outstanding players who are more than 10 years younger than him.  Novak Djokovic is really already great. In the past few years since he returned to the top after surgery in 2018, the records he has set.  There is no doubt that he is the greatest player of all time.
Sinner mi deve una cospicua parte dei suo guadagni in Davis...mi spiego,ogni volta che giravo durante il match con Djokovic, Sinner sbagliava il rovescio,alla sesta volta non ho più cambiato fino a che non ha vinto
I agree with  @fabribeijing, how could it be that this part is missing. He recovered a match from 0 - 40 and the second service, not even the first one. It gives an idea of the mental strength of Sinner, who beat the number 1 in the world three times in 10 days, two times in single and once in Double with Sonego.
VOLEVA VINNNCEEEEREEEEEEE
Einfach...Sinner ❤
Da 0 40 sul 5 4 per diokovic poi l apoteosi la leggenda e il godimento più totale .... grazie grazie grazie grazie
Mamma mia Sinner che rovescio!
What a disappointing end to a sensational year for Djokovic.
Grazie mille per questa gioia e grazie per la felicità che hai dato a noi ❤❤❤❤❤
sto piangendo per la stretta di mano tra i 2.  im crying for the hug friend between them
Sinner will be number 1
I know why I dont like Davis Cup. These exaggerated unnatural emotions from everyone, feels so cheap and fake. Tennis never was supposed to be played in teams.
It's a pleasure to see Sinner playing so well and giving a lesson of how to behave like an adult and being a truly champion to the egomaniac serbian mama's boy.
Djoko out !!!
Sinner is a beast🔥 💪💯🇮🇹
you did not see what happend before match 1.5 to the match starting they take his blood and pea to see the blood if he takes something... and is this normal ?
End of an era!!!
I think Carlos Alcaraz's tennis is a little bit above Sinner (and he'is almost two years younger!) but Sinner mental strenght is incredible. Remember tennis is 50% mental and 50% skills.  Interesting time ahead
It's so weird that Djoko no win having had match points...
Now this will be something for Western Media  to cry for...to sum up Djokovic's year...they will write 10 lines on this match loss and 2 line on all his this years achievements 😂
Highlights deludenti perché non fanno vedere i 3 match point annullati da Sinner.
L'hanno vinta qua la Davis
I don't like Djokovic's game but i really have to give him credit for it. He masterd two shots....forehand and backhand. Rarely misses them, always on target. Thats how he beats anyone. Damn be Volley, smash etc. So boring to watch him.
2024 onwards sinner rocks
Well done Jannik … just a total pro!!!
Grand slam Nole is a different beast …
why can't novak just ignore the crowd? doesn't he realize he is doing exactly what they want him to do? the totally took him out of it mentally because he ALLOWED them to. it's okay he isn't perfect.  he can't win 100 percent of matches played
always good to see the arrogant fall and defeated...
Sinner gli ha  somministrato un bel vaccino😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Complimenti per le capacità, circostanze imbarazzanti del torneo.
Too bad he couldn't beat him the last time they played...
Sinner brutal bravo Italia.
Jannik beat Nole 3 out of 4 times in the span of just a few days. It was really unfortunate and, unbelievalbe I'd say, that he didn't snatch the ATP Finals title, bummer. We finally won a Davis Cup after 47 years. I feel hopeful for Italian Tennis thanks to these guys and even though Jannik is 4th in the ranking, these last days he's been the undisputed #1! Campioni 🇮🇹🏆
Scusate ma il decimo game del 3° set va fatto vedere per intero per Legge!!!
Congratulations Sinner, you’re the next to Novak 🤝🤞🌟🌟🌟👑👑👑
Sinner saved 3 match points against Djokovic 😳🧠
Grande Jannik!
cevapcici 1 pizza 2
Campioni ❤
Ü
Best austrian player ever!!
this video didn't capture the intensity of the macht points saved by sinner
Absolutely masterful
Who did Nole blame this on?
Bravo YAnnik, go for title! 🙏👏🏆🍀🍀
Was für ein super Spiel von Sinner TOP
Karma... Tasting his own medicine😂😂😂😂... Surprised that didn't take any MTO... CHOKERRRRRR😂😂😂😂
Djokovic is the best
It looks like Nole's journey has started passing the peak and slowly on the way down on the other side of the hill whereas Sinner is at the foothill and ascending. It's been some wonderful years for Djokovic, and now it's time for the new, young, and talented one to rise and share the fame. Sinner, you will surely be another GOAT!
W😅W
sinner presto sara' presto il numero uno
Yannick was clearly not well during the Masters finals, the score would not have been so severe otherwise.
After losing so clearly to Djokovic last week, I didn't expect this from Sinner.
So porpette di nuovo
That was a tough one Djokovic choked for sure what must be the first time in years because he losses fine normal but that was not a typical loss that was a choke only.
Aaaaaaaa grande
🇮🇹🇮🇹 ad 01:31 parola della ragazza?
Sei un Gigante Sinner🙌
MONUMENTAL Sinner! Come on Italy! 🇮🇹
Well deserved win for Italy. And a well deserved lesson for Djokovic, he was overconfident of his invincibility.
ma il cielo è sempreee più bluuuuuu 💙💙💙🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹 ok Serbian friends you can take your carrots and ...  uhm  😂 FINAL VS 🇦🇺 can't wait !!
Djokovic let sinner win in return for allowing djokovic through SF at Nitto.
What a player jannik
Bravo Jannik!!!!❤🇮🇹 sei un sogno meraviglioso!!!! Grazieeeeeee
LETTSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Sinner, il primo essere umano a rimontare 3 match point  a sfavore e poi vincere contro sua Maestà Djokovic. Immenso.
🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
Sinner next nr 1.....coming soon.............
Think you mean semi finals Davis cup 😂
It pays to train like a Sinner.
Sinner is the reason why I still watch tennis after Rogerer. Mindblowing
Steely Sinner
usra mu se Siner u zivot, placi srpski rode Kosovo a i Vojvodina uskoro ti ode
After losing in front of his crowd last time to Djoko, Jannik had to raise it for his country now, proud
Chi è il numero 1...??
How beautiful was the game tennis?!!...
SINNER IS THE REAL NUMBER 1 ATP IN THE WORLD 👑  IDEMOOOOOOOO JANNIK 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
The next number 1 … forza Jannik
Questa finale è tutta merito tuo, diventerai molto presto il migliore al mondo,se gia non lo sei,a mio modesto parere!!!
Always been nole fan and I am, but oh man, this guy Sinner is a real beast, beating all top ten one after other, with a mental strength that I saw only in Nole
So Sinner saved the match points, breaks Djoker and then goes on to win the game himself 😮😮😮
A great games.
It's a good day when Sinner wins!
From 0-40 to winning the match that too against Nole is simply incredible ! Bravo Jannik 🙌 Love this rivalry ❤
I don’t understand how Novak has never had a player with a big solid game denying him so many titles. To put it simply how he has won this many titles, no power game at all. If sinner played like this all the time he would easily beat Novak 8-10 times. Novak crumbled the tie was over once he missed the first match point with a poor slice shot that went wide. Sinner broke him mentally after that with balls of steel. This match and the Wimbledon final, just shows why no other finalist who has played against him has not been able enough to either compete or put him under serious pressure, because Djokovic does have the game that can collapse- he’s not unbeatable especially with his serve.
Djoko forgot to drink his magic water.
I like djokvic as person, but his tennis style is boring. I am very happy when somebody can beat him. Congratulation Sinner🎉
Sinner the winner ..thats how it should be always..
Congrats sinner
You win some, (many, many in the case of Nole), and you lose some. That’s life, and sometimes it is extremely hard because you play for your country. Well, if another Serbian player had been the cause of defeat it would have been worse imo. Novak has the strongest shoulders to bear this, and he obviously takes full responsibility. Big champion! Sinner must have played very well so deserved to win. Novak, always my number one ! Support from Belgium 🇧🇪😘
The Italian grim reaper is taking Djokovic to his funeral.
Shit, Nole fans will blame the crowd now. Or the media. But Sinner take a bow.
Djokovic you deserve to loose, your arrogance your unprofessional manners saying yesterday that you were going to take the Davis cup to your country. Eat that up!
Se devi battere il bambino devi giocare a ritmi altissimi
😅Nole  không phải là siêu nhân
In the last 6 months, while media was overhyping carlos, sinner was quietly covering lots of ground.. Considering past few months performances, Sinner is the real threat to Novak in slams instead of carlos..
Djokovic has to his 100% otherwise,  they will beat him regularly. I feel he has not given his 100%. More casual in his approach
Sweet revenge
Such smart groundstrokes by Djokovic. He really is the current standard. Props to Sinner for beating the standard. I expect he'll be more confident and relaxed the next time he meets Djokovic.
This will make 2024 interesting. For the first time Novak has a couple of real young challengers. Carlos initially seemed to be the one but it is looking more like Sinner who will challenge him for number 1 spot next year.
Damn...3 match points down against novak? Wow...similar to what novak did to roger
Novak finally fading out  no more “medical timeouts” to throw off the opponent or fake falls
Il futuro n.1 al mondo batte l'attuale n.1 al mondo
If Sinner is consistent  , he is destined for greatness
Why couldn't Sinner do this in the ATP Finals final?
As a Serbian and a Djoko fan, such a loss is difficult to take, but it's our mistake that we sometimes think Nole must or is going to win every match. Of course, we're used to him winning due to all of his incredible victories and greatness he's achieved! However, in this case you gotta give credit to Italy and their team, well played. Hopefully we'll see a rematch of these two next year.
Молоток Синнер,  удачи в карьере!
Djoker plan is playing cross court opponents should try the same trick to shut himm
As a longtime Djokovic fan, the only time I don't feel bad when djokovic looses is when he looses to Sinner. Because in this new generation, I love Sinner and am already a fan.
Sinner the saint...❤
Never loved Novak
Beating Nole 2 times in a month, that's not a fluke! Sinner has catching up to Nole's level, like it or not. Incoming Nole fans saying "bUt, NoLE 24 GS hUeHehEhEHehe".  I'm talking about their current level of playing, not lifetime achievements.
sinner is the undertaker of tennis
Djokovic got Djokovic'd
For me. after this match Sinner will probably gonna win a GS next year, he is prepared
2:53 ABSOLUTE CHOKE by Nole there. Why not go for down the  One backhand winner
Incredible match for Sinner.  🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🍝🍕🍝
13 of last 16 points to Sinner  Wow
Novak couldn’t care less. These matches are nothing to him but every thing for Italy apparently 😂
Wonderful sinner
Nothing much to be said. When these two play it's always very close. Maybe the lessons learned from Djoko can help Sinner become the best player eventually like Federer's and Nadal's helped Djoko. Now it's vacay time for the GOAT. ⚡️🍀⚡️🇷🇸
Risvegliaci Yannik ❤
Djokovic always failed for his nation....everytime we saw him playing for Serbia he always losses... Congratulations to Sinner....
Che bello ragazzi!!!
amazing sportsmanship from both players, cant wait to see what sinner will become in the later years, and we all know for a fact that we didn't see the best of djokovic, we all also know he's gonna learn from his mistakes and come back a beast next year.
What a rivalry
Sinner has so much potential. I can see him and Alcaraz having a dynasty when Djokovic retires
My money gone 😢😢😢
0.08 ..... SINNER È IL TENNISTA "PIÙ POTENTE" AL MONDO
It's unbelievable. Sinner is likely to have a mental edge over Novak in tight moments after this encounter.
3 match points as soon as i saw Nole fans cheering to loud to distract Sinner on match point and he delivered two shots knew it wasnt going to be any closer, Nole played catastrophic from that moment wasnt even close on any serve and return,kept yelling 3 match point for final for Serbia
Well well, lets see if Djokovic will manqge to win 1 grand slam next year. Sinner seems to beat him on hardcourt. Alcaraz on grass. And Djokovic won RG because of Alcaraz cramps while Nadal will return. Next year could become hell for mister Djokovic.
well the tour finals hurt so much more, but it still nice that Sinner shows the world that he can beat Nole
sinners redemption!!!
I love them  both, all the best for nole
Che forte jannik. Sta diventando il tomba del tennis
1:40 Djokovic celebrating a double fault. Nothing wrong with it, but if Alcaraz/Nadal did it, Djokovic fans would criticize them for it, so I will point it out.   Also Djokovic was up 5-4 40-0 and lost. Super well-played by Sinner, awesome match by both. But I can’t help but think if Alcaraz/Nadal/Federer did this, Djokovic fans would spam it in every comment section. Oh yeah, they have since Wimbledon 2019. So I’m gonna have to be toxic unfortunately: “Chokeovic blew 40-0 😂😂😂😂😂”
3 face to face in two weeks 😳
love it
1:36 that right there is why people dislike djokovic even though he is the most successful player of all time. Nadal or Federer would not have celebrated on a double fault
Damn Sinner
Toilet break couldn't save him this time.
Ajmo siner karaj cetnike u usta.
what i saw today was incredibley done by Sinner, congrats to him and his team! Otherwise that wasn`t djokovic like today :/ He missed many shots that he wouldn't miss usually. Sinner got the revenge of the ATP Final
That's my man!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Fenomeno Sinner
Lol when did serbia become good at tennis
This was ridiculous, Djokovic was just handing over the first set, and how he squandered that 4-5 0-40 lead....unbelievable. Sometimes I think he and others are betting on his matches.
Grandissimo Sinner!!!🤩👍
Issokay it’s just Davis cup
Wow. 2023 is really the breakthrough season for Sinner. I’m a big Djokovic fan but I’m happy for Sinner. Hope he’ll have a even better 2024.
Chokeovik.
ITALIA
Sinner is word from a "sin" and we all know what that word means in bible and on the other side Novak is against everything what is a sin he is against everything what west whant to impose to all normal side of the world so for me this hate from his haters is just a synonym for the situation in world politics
Novak beaten TWICE by Sinner in this month alone! More defeats to come.😊
Bravo Jannik!! Good job!!💪💪
Love the celebration.. He could have rip his shirt as well after saving match points and defeating djoker (twice in last 3 matches in 3 weeks) but he didn't.. That shows a true class and character of Sinner.. Djoker can learn from him..
Novak is king number 1
Djokovic really can’t handle the nerves when playing for Serbia or in Serbia.  - Lost from 2 sets to love and a double break up against Davydenko Davis Cup 2008  - Missed the smash in Olympics 2008 match point vs Nadal  - Lost to Krajinovic Belgrade 2010  - Lost to Del Potro Davis cup 2011 and cried  - Lost to Murray and bronze medal match to Del Potro Olympics 2012  - Went to 5 sets with kukushkin Davis cup 2016  -  Lost first round Olympics to Del Potro 2016 and cried  - Lost from match point to Rublev and Khachanov in doubles Davis Cup 2019  - Lost to Krajinovic Adria Tour 2020 and cried  - Lost to Karatsev Belgrade 2021  - Struggled through all his matches against bad players Belgrade 2 which also took place in 2021  - Choked from a set and break up against Zverev Olympics 2021  - Lost another bronze medal match to Carreno Busta Olympics 2021  - Struggled through all his matches en route to the final in Belgrade 2022  - Got bageled by Rublev and lost in the final of Belgrade 2022  - Lost to Lajovic in Belgrade tournament 2023 (hosted in Banja Luka)  - Lost from 0-40 having 3 match points against Sinner Davis Cup 2023   If anything, he is getting worse when competing for Serbia. It’s clear the Olympics is clearly on his mind. Does not bode well for him ahead of the games next year. These wouldn’t even be terrible stats, but he only plays for Serbia around once a year and to have this many losses compared to his usual level clearly shows he struggles big time
Nole prendi e porta a casa ! Questa volta la lezione di tennis te l' ha data L' IMMENSO SINNER!!!
Sinner e basta!!!
Sinner C'è eeeee!!!!!  Vola.❤
Grande Sinner, partita fenomenale!!!
Bye bye Djokovic. End is near
Congratulations sinner!
You see how much No1e cares, he celebrated so many points. Never happens in his tour matches.
01:32 la ragazzina che gli dice "maglione" non ha prezzo😂
Djokovic really sucks when playing for his country or playing in Serbia. Incredible from Sinner. He’s really at that level now
If only he beat Djokovich too at the ATP finals 😢
Bravo italiano….
Wow, this is classic karma- Sinner winning after saving multiple match points, karma bit Novak big time, thank God for that, he is mortal after all, not the Invincible God of tennis we all thought- shows he can be beaten, hope Federer gets inspiration from this, and comes back, to put the icing on the cake!
❤ Sinner in action
Im the biggest fan of the BIG 3 but once in a while I would like to see new player emerge as champion. With Djokovic I dont see any seasoned player can beat him and he managed to stop the rise of the younger players. Djokovic will win all 4 GS in 2024! Good Luck Djokovic, stay healthy and go for the biggest record in tennis history!
These highlights don't show how Djokovic was throwing everything he could at Sinner in the third set and yet the redhead resisted with nerves of steel. Think about it, he was down 0/40 at 4-5 and he not only saved three match points, he then broke Djoko's serve and held his last serve game. Foxes die hard.
Novaak wasnt even playing serious 😅
Novaak let him win clearly 😂
Italy dominating Serbia
Proud to be Italian today! 🔥
Wow! What a match!
Just like that, Serbian is out of the Davis Cup. They could have won the Davis Cup if they made it to the final. The 3 match points is going to haunt Djokovic!
I guess it counts to the official H2H ? So now it is only 4-2 for Nole. But to win twice with Nole one day is something special.
100% team support effort from both countries.  What a sportsmanship.
Djokovic como te quedo el ojo te comieron y bien comido
Sinner definitely reached another level.
Jannik non è leggenda, è qualcosa di più
Novak is still my champion 🏆 🏆 🏆 Sinner plays well. He's gaining momentum to carry on. He's good.
When Novak is winning his arrogance and bragging comes out, but when he ends up losing you can see he is so pissed...He thinks he can never lose....Well done Sinner
Oggi x il tennis giorno da ricordare finale di Davis 2 coppie italiane una maschile una femminile hanno vinto la finale e Fognini domani in finale in  Spagna che spettacolo.
Sinner is great but djokovic let himself down there. Im surprised he didnt go for the passing shot at 40-30 for match point
Why Djokovic didn't go down the line on match point is a mystery given he's done that in the past with Fed in ATP finals and other times.
Sinner is on the rise. The way he handle himself is extraordinary.
Mi sono commosso con non mi era mai successo prima, non riuscivo più a parlare dall'emozione a fine partita...sullo 0-40 i Serbi  festeggiavano  sicuri di avere già vinto,stavolta se ne vanno a casa con la coda tra le gambe, inoltre abbiamo vinto anche nel doppio..ditemi quando mai Djokovic ha perso 2 partite nello stesso pomeriggio..GODOOOOOO!!!!!!!
I would’ve clicked this video of it were triple the length. You could’ve shown all three match point opportunities, we wouldn’t mind ;)
Novak is only a good singles player his greatness doesn’t translate to doubles
The thing i would delete from the rules is that long toilet break. Tell me the reason why a player after losing the first set should go to the bathroom and spend 15-20 min in there. Why? Do you need to pee? Ok, 5 min is enough.  In my opinion it is a bad rule and nosense
That was awesome 👏🏼.
So he blew it from 40-0 at 5-4? Jesus christ
Jannick sei il nostro orgoglio 🟩⬜🟥
Nole es vencedor 2023 y viene muy cansado así mismo llegó en la final solo quería ganar más un título porqué el puede y es grande
grandissimo Sinner!
Serve and volley did not work against Sinner in the round-robin match of the ATP finals. In the final of the ATP finals Djokovic did not use serve and volley much and he won. Now he used it again (f.ex on the crucial break punt in set 3) and he lost again. Normally Djokovic is smarter than that.
Jannick is the new Roger ❤️
Would wait for Sinner to do more Outdoors and in Bo5 ,to conclude he is sensational...
I am an Alcaraz fan, but i also like watching Sinner.  These young rookies are amazing.
A courageous effort by ice cool Sinner who deserved the win. This was followed by a fearless Italian doubles team of Sinner & Sonego who were victorious against the weaker less coordinated Serbians in Djokovic and Kecmanovic.  Serbia being knocked out will be very painful to Djokovic, after much shouting about his desire to win everything, including the Davis Cup and his jeering of the opposing crowds. Perhaps a little more humility would serve him well.
Tbh, i don't mind about djokovic's loss cuz this group tournament doesn't grant any ATP points. But, the problem is djokocic led 5-4 with 40-0 on 3rd set but ended up 5-5 and finally 5-7??? Well, djokovic has to be careful with that in australia open 2024 which he has to defend there
BIG , BIG , SINNER
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Semifinals. Not quarterfinals
He will be number 1 soon
Haha that is the best win against Djokovic and Serbia as whole
Beating twice a very good form Djokovic in the space of two weeks is a great achievement by Sinner
Novak "0-40" Clownovic 😂😂😂
Novak was very flat-footed in the first set but as usual he fixed it and made Jannik look slow in the second set. What a great ending and a boost for Jannik’s confidence to save match points in the final set and triumph!
I think Davis Cup shouldn't be so close to the ATP Finals, Nole had spent his body to the max for the title sunday, and the next day was going to Malaga.
Novak was so lethargic in this match he only plays for personal Records not for his country if it was Master1000 he might have defeated sinner in 2 sets😏
We have to take into account that Nole is 36, has just finished an intense season with 7 titles, and faced a young Sinner who's absolutely an elite player. Unfortunately he couldn't win, but it was a great match.
Finally
Avesse giocato così Sinner la finale dei Finals di Torino.
0:40 . Pressure is a privilege.
A 21 yrs old showing more maturity on court than a 36 champion
Sinner !!🔥🔥🔥🔥 bam .!!! Sinner 1 djokovic 0 .😂
Italia's future tennis # 1.
mamma jannik sará il nuovo Nole
Wow this is incredible for sinner now he has to do in a grand slam .
Aaaah, unbeateble.....OK.
Sto iniziando a credere che possa diventare numero uno. Chi? Ovvio no? L'altro e' gia' numero uno. Vai Jannik!
Play like this is why I LOVE this game. It is so important to have several good athletes pushing each other in their respective sports,  champions become champions because they are pushed to be so, by other champions.✊
this kid is ready to kick Alcaraz ass
Haha
lol sinner to sonego, "go get ready dude".
Good to see Tipsie and Berra in the respective team boxes.
Orgoglio italiano 🇮🇹
If anyone is going to do something incredible and rare against Djokovic, I'm glad it was Sinner.  Future great right here.
Idemooo bree❤
What a choke from Novak... crazy that this happens so often when playing for his country
Bravo, ma avrei preferito vincesse il master. La devis nel tennis è come la coppa Italia nel calcio
The Prince That Was Promised
Super, bravo Italia 👍
At 2:54, Djokovic's match point, instead of a passing shot down the line to seal the win, Djokovic hit the ball right back to Sinner in the middle of the court, for an easy put-away. That was a brain fart.
I would like to ask the Serbs in the stands who were holding and waving all those carrots during the match, I would like to ask them at the end of the matches what they did with them
It's semifinal, no quarter-final
Sinner ha battuto Djokovic 2 volte in singolare negli ultimi 12 giorni...non è un caso, secondo me lo vedremo ancora più in alto in classifica, il quarto posto gli va stretto!!
in 2024 Sinner will be a force to reckon with !
Terrible highlights: Sinner have recovered 3 match points in a row and only one of them is in the clip.
Novak will take his revenge at the AO Open 2024 😂😂😂 Never Underestimate The Joker
Sinner marziano, prossimo numero 1 al mondo
that is why I said Sinner will be world No. 1 soon.
Sinner ❤
Yeah it’s gonna be sinner and Alcaraz dueling for #1  one day
Well done 🇮🇹!
Seems like djoko handed over the match to sinner, intentionally because the result goes in djoko s favor 99.9% of the time yk
Italy FTW!!!
Novak is basically a very good man. He helped everyone a lot. He has a wonderful family. A true believer and a good Christian. Leave him alone. He is excellent at his job, he works hard, unlike those who think they are humiliating him by whistling. Ordinary scumbags and thugs. It doesn't matter where you are from, it matters what kind of person you are. Greetings to all good people from beautiful Serbia. 🇷🇸
Chokovic 🤣
You could've done that in ATP finals sinner, congratulations
To care ajmo xhole vreme je za penziju
Nole 🇷🇸👍❤️
This is the best loss for Novak , not a GS Final or major Masters event, yes he wanted to top off his season but this will be the fuel needed for a big Australian swing in January hopefully
That's crazy.
That's crazy.
Djokovic should have gone down the line with that 30-40 match point, had the open court what an error from Djokovic!
OLÈ OLÈ OLÈ OLEEEE, SINNEEER, SINNEEER 👊🏻💙
I can't wait to see what Sinner will accomplish in 2024
A casa djokowc 😂
San Jannik 🙏
In questo momento Jannik è secondo al mondo in pectore, ha raggiunto Alcaraz come numero di vittorie contro Nole (2). Nè Alcaraz e nè Medvedev sono più forti di lui
Sinner is the man. The future.
Sorry Nole, time is undefeated
BRAVO SINNER 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
FORZA SINNER!
I sogni di gloria....ma il cielo è sempre più azzurroooooooo...  Grazie amici spagnoli che alla fine avete fatto partire la canzone Il cielo è sempre più blu del mitico Rino Gaetano 🖐️🖐️
Mature people would just accept that Italy played well, instead of saying Serbia doesn’t take it seriously. Nobody ever wants to give credit to this nation.
what a player Sinner 🥕🥕🧡!!
Это третий матч за полторы недели чтоли??🤣🥎🤣
Mamma mia Jannik 🔥
Bravo Siiner, battere il n. 1 è sempre un'impresa
Watch out for Sinner come 2034. He dares to go toe to toe no fear or favor. Grande Janik. Vamos Janik. 💪 💪 💪
Mamma mia 🙌🏻
A great winner for a great Djokovic.
We all feel bad for Mr 40-0 today... Hope he will do better next year 🙏
Sinner played incredible today, he will win Davis cup for Italy tomorrow
that match point save in the highlights....shades of 40-30, but if Fed had approached into the backhand instead
That come back is just mesmerising
Balls of steel. I love how Sinner has been taking it to Djokovic last few matches they played.
Another example Novak not taking these seriously
After the singles win, Sinner/Sonego also beat Djokovic/Kecmanovic in doubles. Sinner now can claim to have beaten Djokovic twice in the same day...I don't think this has ever happened before !
I am so happy that Djokovic is not winning everything...
MA IL CIELO E' SEMPRE PIU' BLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Semifinal
Andiamo!!!!!🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
Great game by Jannik.👏
È una buffonata rispetto alla coppa Davis di una volta. 3 match al meglio di 3 sets invece che 5 al meglio di 5. Ma Sinner è stato eccezionale.. Djokovic è sempre il numero uno, ma forse stasera ha visto il suo più probabile successore. Grande Sinner, ma anche grande Djokovic...
Djokovic verliest héél af en toe en vandaag is zon dag. Ik wens zijn gezin en familie vee succes toe met de rest van deze dag. Hij zal wel not amused zijn.😅
Now i feels Djokovic getting older
Sinner real world n 1 at the moment, no doubt
Fracaso total de Serbia y de Djokovic 😅
Grazie di esistere Jannik sei un avenger carotaman il mio supereroe
wow Berrettini it's the only one that doesn't look happy for Sinner.... that is so easy to see... why is there????? go home if you don't support all of your team lol.
Godo
Great win for Sinner, but Nole was not at his best acter his big win...the best is yet to come!
When Djokovic plays for his country, he can't seem to handle the pressure. If this match was played in like Canada or Indian Wells, he would have won.
How is it possible and how can my mind believe in this ?😮
what an hell of a game same thing with Sonego  0-40 they end up wining that point.
im a novak fan but this is when he realizes he should have retired years ago  a turning point for the good tennis player
Now it looks like he’s human afterall…
It’s funny how much more beatable djokovic is during non-elimination matches lol.
What a match, forget the djokovic alcaraz rivalry, its now the djokovic sinner rivalry which i like more and a much more entertaining match up, sinner really has djokovic's number now lol
Djokovic doesnt give his all in davis cup matches and laver cup matches...
insane, today they play tennis at lavel INSANE!
Musetti doveva vincere porca la miseria ! 😢😢😢
Bravo...sinner...great match keep up...future wirld no 1.sinner
Djokovic out-hit, out-powered and out-maneuvered Sinner in the 2nd and 3rd set...almost every service game of Sinner in the 3rd set had a break point, while he held comfortably and he still managed to loose.   Gods were kind on Sinner today, considering his heart breaking loss at the WTF.  Djokovic will be scratching his head at this loss.
Huge confidence booster for Sinner, even though it's not a Masters 1000 or a slam.
The slice at the first match point will be one of the worst shot selection ever from Djokovic XD
From 0-40 and match point of Djokovic to winning the match for Sinner.. absolutely incredible
I didn't know there was a traffic jam in this stadium!😂😂
Go Sinner!
Sinner is the 4th man ever to beat Djokovic  despite being match point down.Until today only Youzhny in 2007, Nadal in 2009 and Cilic in 2018 managed to achieve this. Incredible from the italian😊
After more than 1000 pro matches he played,Djokovic lost after 3 consecutive match points for the first time.
Sinner deserved the win so much ❤ Grande Jannik!
