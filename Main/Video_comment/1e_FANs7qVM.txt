I think Liverpool need to take the investment route because of the United Sale! Anyone that wants to buy a football club why would you buy liverpool vs United 😂😂
We need an owner who can beat the devil out of the club 🤣
Mark, I love your content but Jesus Christ how many times can you repeat the garnacho point…. Flippin said the same thing 10 times over
Didn't Maguire win the premier League with Leicester
Anthony Gordon is horrific. Onana is the only positive thing at Everton right now. Saying this because he got asked who he’d take from Everton if they were to be relegated
@Goldbridge: at 9:20 you say that Jadon Sancho is like a new signing and then you proceed to rating him. Now in my eyes 👀 and I wonder if anyone thinks the same that: Jadon Sancho, is nothing but another "Paul Pogba".!!! Please let me know if you agree, or give me your view if you think otherwise. Thank you 💯 ⚽  🙈 🙉 🙊
Get him out the club
Take a shot every time mark says sentimentality
Club  captain  Always  at the  bench. He has  to  know is time to  move on. He  always  freezes  our striker's  by keeping the ball at the back playing  with  David  DeGea.
Long winded Bob
Lucia Luke Shaw Martinez this better than him by far Martinez won the World Cup watch Luke shaw as win
Do we have to pay for loaning Maguire 🤭🤭🤭
Atletico should pay us a loan fee for Lindelof, around 9 millions...or we just ask that to mock them! Atletico cannot even pay they toilet paper bill how are they going to pay his vage?!?!?
I'd get Scammaca/Paqueta and Onana/Iwobi
Maguire swap for rice
Loan Maguire for 5mil. Then sell him got 45mil summer
@Goldbridge: Ha-Ha Ha L.o.L What the hell was that about Mark.??? At 2:51 into the show wow.!! Yah couldn't get that one out could yah. OMG..!!! If any English speaking person just started watching this video at the said '2:51', they would be completely lost... As it looks like you too was. I hope that you keep a copy of that 😂🤣😭 Get ready to be clipped up on that statement. That is the main problem with live streaming because if you mess up, there's No editing that out. Well done Goldbridge, still laughing an hour later 😂🤣😭
The background looks good Mark
What a load of twaddle about maguire. He has been great for United since he signed in a top four team as well as the best cb in the England team.  Short memories people forget how uniteds defence struggled nearly every game until maguire joined
I would loan him. Get a portion of his wages offset….albeit a small amount but would be good for him to get playing time with a team that suits him. He is not imo up to standards of the current team.
IDE like to see Bailey coached by 10 hag and see what he can do.
united should get gray if everton to be relegated
Sources close to the club have confirmed that Todd Bohely is planning a shock last minute move for Sir Jim Radcliffe's target Manchester United
Sell Maguire Lindelof is a better player than him
Everything you see in Dubai is built on credit. They have no oil left - Abu Dhabi does. They never had any Natural Gas - Qatar has it all. Dubai owning United would just be another version of the Glazers, but this time we wouldn't know who we are in hock to...
Why is my question for Maguire. Shocking player
Chelsea and Man City ruined a lot . I just don’t want the great institution that is man United to go down that route.
Why even debate who the new owners will be at the end of the day we have zero say on who it will be the glazers do not care about us ultimately it’s their decision it will be the highest bidder whether we like the new owners or not a lot of fans didn’t want the glazers and look how that turned out
Luke Shaw is an inspiration.
Meh, he's our 5th choice cb
Phil Jones just wow
Maguire out out out!!!
Maybe I'm the only one but when I see maguire coming on with 10 mins to go against a lower quality side who are going to pump balls into the box, I actually get a little bit of relief. He hasn't messed up in a while and he'd actually very good in the air
I don't want to see him lifting any trophy...
Westham would actually suit maquire since they play a low block so no pushing up high and getting beat for pace .
The benefit is not having to see him take the captain's armband every time he steps on the pitch. What a fucking farce.
Glazers and Klaus Schwab, makes sense.
Utd win a few games and apparently you now have a few world class players lol
Harry Maguire is human being like all of us it's not nice the way he is being treated give the guy a break .
I mean sell maguire and bring back eric bailey or bring telles and play shaw at cb(hypothetically possible)
manscape, so you can look like ten hag where it counts
Tonalli will never leave Italy
Varna go 75k is about just rit he’s the future for us !!!!🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
We need owner with vision and capability to run the club. Biased personal preference won’t bring us anywhere
He won a prem didn't he ?
Garnacho just break out in the team and want move aready the youth Fi just cool
Ratcliffe has a much higher net worth than boehly for instance
Manscaped. Make sure you don't trim the yard and make the grass look redder. 😖
No one should be loaned on January. Our squad is not the the biggest, even maguire will have a role to play during the season.
Shaw reminds me of Paul Parker. Despite not being the tallest, both were excellent at both full and centre back.
BBC was enjoying some BBC. 💪🏾
We will need Sancho coming to the end of the season
We need to get rid of Maguire but not now. Permanent transfer in the summer is the right move for him.
Thanks for highlighting the Cowboys victory over Tom Brady and the Glazers! Glazers Out! Let’s go United
Lewis Hamilton is gonna buy the club too lol
If he stays, ETH needs to sit him down and explain to him that he is not our captain anymore and won't be lifting any trophy!
Ineos v Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. I'm sorry but that dude wont be able to compete against Man City, Newcastle, PSG or Chelsea for one.
Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) is looking into the purchase of either Man Utd or Spurs as quoted by Ebrahim Al Mahmoud on Bloomberg yesterday.
Jim Radcliffe = Ineos = cycling tours, America Cup sailing,   Formula One with Mercedes,  looks good to me!
Maguire lifting any trophy Utd win will absolutely ruin the feeling of winning! Get rid of him. Bruno's our captain. End of!
God I'd love to see Maguire gone! Every time he comes on he's straight over grabbing the captain's armband which he never deserved in the first place. I'd say ETH has been planning this. Another reason why Shaw's been playing CB and has been 100 times better than Maguire
Manu player wages are insane...
Martinez in midfield is the future.
Old Trafford needs a roof. Like the Mercedes Benz sponsored stadium in Atlanta to get boxing and Martial Arts events to make more revenue
Sir Jim Radcliffe likes to have friends / people he knows and trusts to run his businesses.
There are six Glazers only two are interested in United.
The Best Owner is what's needed
Honestly I understand you keeping going on about “Maguire isn’t/won’t leave in January “ BUT you have to understand at this point he’s not even a United player he is just a liability to United… he needs to leave for his own career
Mu
Jim Radcliffe trying to buy us and this is the best headline you can come up with maguire is going nowhere
Yes
Guys why has Ten hag not moved on Phil Jones?
Please leave Maguire
Would get rid of harry yesterday
Gordon frm EVERTON.....n there's Damari Gray....c'mon Mark.....ssshh
United are in the title race, for now
Why no club asking for Jones, etc.
Memory serves me right few months ago Mark was saying Sir Jim would be the perfect owner...
Didn't  Harry win the league?
I’m still laughing at the dude that said Maguire gonna play CDM 😂
its wierd we didint see MArty, rashy and sanchy frontline yet after preseasson :D
Don’t forget Maguire is also our emergency striker 😂
I hope sancho is well dryed out and ready  to go
Hopefully any attempt from the Middle East to buy us gets blocked
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SHOUT IN THE INTRO?????
Sancho! My favourite United player 😇

... have a choice.
Not only don't we have the information, we also don't
Inios  has its dark side like every successful company , angels are not successful in business
Remember he played casimero at cb could be the replacement for varane in the mean time
Can't loan Maguire without a replacement  or a squad addition
Maguire is an absolute sloth, needs to go asap.
Better attributes, its like ETH is playing top trumps for the lineup
I don't understand what we saw every Man Utd is getting better and better look at Rashford, Shaw, and Bisaka maybe one day this season Maguire would be the one saving us It is always easy for us to let players go just like that just like Scott McTominay Give Ten Hag time he will improve these players
It shouldn't be Maguire alone, also Martial.
God don’t send him to brighton
20k a week is called incentive, Mark. If he comes calling in a year, he's doing the business. 75k is doing the same idiot deals that Utd have been doing for years.
He was born in England mark that makes him English. You might be someone who isnt proud to be English but doesnt mean every other English person is the same as you.
Avvv pleeeeed the giimmmmmmmm!!!
Who's taking Maguire? That would be brilliant news. West Ham? Replacement for Dawson. Works for both teams
Was Sancho suffering mental health problems?
Kane rice and maguire have never won a trophy.... shocking lol
I heard ETH fancy’s maguire upfront.. banging them in training 😮
Martinez is the better CB but Shaw has proven he can fill in and is more than capable
Do you feel something different this window? Strangely, teams want to buy/loan our players. No body was interested in our players in the past.
Giving Garnacho £75k a week would be a ridiculous idea, keep him at £20k and give him a better contract as he performs. Everyone wants to increase their earnings for good performance, you need to keep the leverage to increase it rather than blowing your load at £75k over 5 years.
Garnacho, or any younger player shouldn't be given more than 25k a week, then give them incentive based boosts per year. It's time we started being more sensible and strict with wages.
I don’t know if anyones mentioned this but I feel ten hag has handled this Sancho situation amazingly because if you remember ole was playing lingard through his mental issues rashford was getting played while he was having issues but ten hag has seemed to have really supported Sancho and left him out and helping him get better I just love this manager everything about him I’m so glad we got him! GGMU
Oil me up✌️
The reason why people don't want middle eastern countries in charge of the club is because they just want to use it as a sports washing enterprise, they want to hide the fact that 90% of their labour force is made up of literal slaves. I do not want slave owners to have anything to do with United. That's the end of it.
I think sancho need to be fighting with Antony , I don’t want him stunting garnacho on the left
If Newcastle want mctominay start the bidding at 40 million pounds no offers below make them over pay
Swap maguire for rice in the summer good deal obviously we would need to trow a few quid aswell??
United had to get this contra Contract sorted quick with garnacho because real Madrid and juventus were lerking 😢😢😢
Honestly think that there are many people or consortiums can easily out bid sir jim so just cos he in the bidding doesn't mean he will be the new owner
Swap deal for paquetta
Glazers out
i would love dubai to get united and one the main reasons being would be the stadium they would build would be unbelievable 7 star job best in the world
Shedding a light on the buy, a bit like the light on your jumper
Maguire is an experienced pro at relegation battles. It will suit him perfectly
Dalot on 25 k a week is mad and garnacho should leave if offered anything less than 50 k the board need to fix up sharpish
OIL ME UP
Quick thought - do you think there’s a chance with new owners, they may want to put their stamp on the club and get rid of EtH at the first sign of trouble during the season or in the summer? It would set them up for an awful start with the fans but something to perhaps consider
Loan ELANGA and Maguire so we can loan a forward or a defender for the dept
Regarding Garnacho and contract - Don't spoil these young players too early with huge contracts, look at what happened with Nicklas Bendnter at Arsenal. All joke aside, his talent was enormous, he could have been one of the best strikers, but he got swallowed in the lifestyle of the rich and famous, instead of applying himself and working hard to reach a very high level.
Maguire isn't my favorite but I wouldn't sell nor loan any player at this stage have so many games to come n in that manner in which they coming. Every player is important at this point.  If y'all notice Every player is performing now
Maguire on loan to Westham makes perfect sense. He can add another relegation to his CV and simultaneously lower the asking price for Declan Rice.
LMAO " Harry Maguires never won anything in his life, I don't even think he won during the school sports day" 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
The glazers may never sell utd. Could just be a ploy for a cash injection.
if garnacho takes 20k a week and agrees . if he does not perform to the level expected u have nothing to lose. if he comes back in a year he aint asking for 150k a week u have lost ur mind
Swap harry maguire and scott mctominay for Rice. good deal for both teams
Imagine we won the PL and CR7 got a premier league winners medal from Saudi Arabia 🤔
Maguire won the Bangkok cup 😂
Maguire must go. He needs to play regularly. 🙄
Lmao Don’t worry that won’t be funny sounds on the background 😂This guy got jokes
Hopefully our good form will inspire Sancho to get back to his old form. People need to remember his true level
Sell him please 🙏🏽
We need to bring more players in not deplete our ranks more. Have you seen our fixture list? So congested. Isn't the Champions league going to include more teams next season? We need to strengthen the team and with the right players who suit Ten Hag's style.
No to the loan deal it's too soon to get rid we don't have replacements for specific players yet
50k fair for Gernacho
Savagebridge 😂
No we need the depth. In Ten Hag we trust.
People are saying United don't have enough squad depth, why would we loan out three of our squad players for god sake (McTominay, Maguire, Elanga)
I don’t want owners that appoint ex-players in strong roles within United
"If they said loan to buy for Harry Maguire, for 50 million, I'd drive him there myself" 🤣
Imagine if u could quicksell players like in UT, I would quicksell maguire
Sell him!
NO LOAN DEAL!!! Sell only!!
He is gonna play like lingardinho not better
I’ll be happy as well as a little sad if maguire leaves I pity him sometimes ,guy is over trolled don’t know if the people trolling can bear what he has gone through,there should be a limit to everything that all I’m saying .
Glazers : "It's like a new signing"
Finally
Nobody is gonna want Maguire.
the squad selection is extremely shallow. why would they loan out maguire? makes no sense.
Sell maguire
Loving the LEDs mark
Shaw has been excellent at cb, but I wanna see him in his rightful place at lb..
