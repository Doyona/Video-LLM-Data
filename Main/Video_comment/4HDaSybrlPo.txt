Lego needs to take inspiration and make a arcade at the Lego building
Make a EV3 into a gameboy
Hi bro, I made my own gun and Ashley and I made it today. It took very hard work.

Lol
You should change the button to fixs it
Omg😍😎😲
Your. So entertaining
Everything is not lego the room your desk
Yo that td bricks video
Wait until he writes a script to get lego to beat games

He’s watching td bricks
5:40 blud is watching to bricks
Why does he sound straight and look gay
I have GX >:)
bruuhh
Can it play bad apple!! on the tv?
this is cool but use a real joystick and buttons. cant skimp out on the most important part aka not legos. your monitor isnt legos. this is beyond impressive anyways and more impressive with legos, i do get it. and that girl - never been to arcade? wtf?
Very cool! But there is a big flaw in your design, the stick should be at the left and the buttons to the right, it has been like this since always during 80s and the 90s, I have been in the arcade so many times. Maybe you should have done a street fighter image like pixel art on the sides of the arcade. Your lighting bolts are nice, but the top looks like a cat paw 🐾
The clock in the background does not work😂.
Do you have Star Wars lego
What you are a master builder
Never use duplo or never trust it use normal lego bcs it's stronger
Make a secric Minecraft gaming room inside of the lego room

Make the Empire State building
note for the sponsor part, chrome already has "Tab Islands"
6:34 Instant regret 💀
Me when I walk into that room without socks 😨😨😨😭😭😭😭 (bcuz the floor is the Lego tops)
you should do a video last to leave the lego room
Why not make custom cd discs out of legos but instead of it going in it falls and put the disc in

I probably would glue Lego pcs on control panel
Riley: Look at that.  *Bricks Snap* Me: What are we looking at again? 😂😂
Dude is so smart
U always make it work❤😂
*this so cool do more i love it*
This man has to be ADHD free to do dis (I have ADHD) but atleast I,m smarter    I think
Also they don’t know they’re playing with a ps5 controller
I love his creative mind
What game was he playing in 15:39 to 16:06 ?

That is impressive mechanical engineering on the controllers. Very cool.
There is no r2 and L2, also you can’t use those up, down, left and right things ( not square triangle x and circle)
6:30
shower thoughts be like:
I want to build dat😊 can you please Show me which briks i need to  use so i can buy them😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊❤ and your videos are cool
PS5 has become an Arcade machine.

You should try to add buttons for the triggers

When he said they put steel frames inside them sometimes but their main option is glue
wait how do the controllers charge
very risky
Hello
This guy is the best youtuber and I love when he build any Lego he's cool.
Duelshock wasn't in the PlayStation 5 event. They went beyond duelshock to create duelsense with hundreds of chips. How about recreating the Lego duelsense machine with the PlayStation 4 Pro? By doing so I get a perfect view of my racing sonic game.
12:49 uuuummmm actually did you mean a cube🤓
Can we respect the fact that he came up with this by himself he is a absaloute genius
POV controller dies has to take it all apart 😂
WHOA MAN, JUST WHOA.
His hands after finishing it💀
Roxk paper scissor in cat. 😂
This is my favourite video❤
You literally made a entire Lego room And an entire Lego arcade machine and an entire Lego vending machine and so much more you are literally the king
Would be interesting to see a redesign with the new access controller
What about the airflow? This thing is gonna be an oven
you will probably have to install some fans in there other whys it will over heat
I bet this can't get 1 likes
I made a Lego born 😢😢

You should add a charger for the controllers
How do you charge your controller
I have an idea. Get a PS2, Do the same method with the PS5 Arcade Machine And Print Out Different Giant Stickers For Each Disk Put In The PS2
I love lego so much
On the joystick system you should have made a square around and then put an axel on the top😅 btw nice vid❤👽👌
Like this comment if you think brick science should be in a season of lego masters  👇
I like arcade so much
stepping on lego is painful Brick Science: makes a whole room of lego
The best “downgrade” ever. Or upgrade?
The best “downgrade” ever
Do you think you could try building that same thing, but with a Nintendo Switch and Pro Controllers? I am stuck, and cant do the joystick or buttons.
Brick.
The fact that he used the MR whosetheboss theme supporting his channel
right when he pulled up the lightning bolts I just screamed "FREDDY FAZBEAR?" love you content btw.
what if u want to play Astros playroom to play the you need to use the touchpad
What about R2 and L2 ????🤔

POV me when playing with Lego
How do you charge controller
How many does it take to build that??
Just look at the PlayStation logo 😮🎉🎉
But of a shame that the joystick is on the right side
Hello everyone
Ah i sh*t forgot to charge it 🤦
What this guy does is magic!
This is awesome. But I’m kinda worried about it overheating. Since the console is in a very small area without airflow.   Not to mention you don’t use the stand, which means that some vents on the bottom are blocked, making it even worse
I would love to build something like that, this is so cool!
Kuhgkjghýg7i!uyk¡y6uk8uyløōōœôôœœœōōōœôœõõliu

Kunmi,tcr gt zhvvhvh
Watching this video off Opera
It looks cool, but you need to fix the joysticks.  They’re on the wrong side.  You control the joystick with the left hand and press the buttons with your right.
Why are the joysticks on the wrong side of the buttons?
send this to mrbeast
How the heck are you capable of standing on a Lego ocean?😩 9:12     Anyways nice build👌
Thanks for watching TD BRICKS

i love legos end i bild this
Shu
Good
i have a ps3
I had an idea for if you wanted to make a lego moving chair for the desk, im not a expert but maybe ypu cpuld build a chair, then add me mechanisms under it under the floor that let it roll back and foward a few feet and have a button or something that lowers some stoppers on the back legs to make it not move when you want it to stay still, this might have some issues but I thought it could work, also love your lego content and your creativity is amazing.
It occurs to me that if I had a lego room I would want to put tile pieces along the entire floor so that you are not stepping on studs. I suppose you would want to make that modular possibly using those little quarter sized baseplates.
Our guy here building stuff that i dreamt about when i was a kid
Am I the only one who got hurt when Riley dropped the controller?
bro what about R2 and L2
I wish i had the blocks to build this

14:23 1)if you break it your money on that PS5 you will die         15:03 2)if you do this thing fans you will actually bro actually don’t do that
For the joystick, you could build a sort of gripper, that holds an old technic ball piece. Like brick machines did for his LEGO laptop
bro is actually a g for making this like imagine the time and dedication it must've took
👏👏👏👏👏 will done bro🎅 and merry christmas

Van you build a arcade for a Nintendo switch so it’s a mini arcade ❤
play fortnite lego
https://shrinkme.org/hWML    Fortnite has had many major crossovers with big-name properties over the years, with the most recent one being the appearance of Ahsoka Tano of Star Wars fame as an unlockable character skin to celebrate her recent Disney+ series. This rumored Fortnite x LEGO event will be different, as it will feature not only in-game content but real-world building sets as well. Official details are still scarce at the moment, so eager fans will have to stay tuned for more information about this ambitious union between Fortnite and LEGO.
Make it so it can play minecraft

Flip the ps5 horizontally! I had a ps5 vertical and it fried and broke cause of Liquid Metal!!!
Something else you didn’t point out is that you could just take out the controller and play anything
I wouldn’t mind doing this
You should put the stand on the PS5, without the stand it has no rubber feet
Im watching this while wearing a playstaition shirt.

Wow
A small fresnel lens (you can find them in TVs) would distribute the light up top more evenly 😊
Real Brick science fans like to my comment
I have a request for the next video maybe a gun that work that shoots and you don’t have to accept my request but I would like if you did
This is insane!!!
That is very cool that must have taken you ages!
PS5s tend to overheat when placed upright because gravity slowly pulls on the Liquid Metal on the cpu and melts it so it loses contact and fries the chip. Just something to think about. Fantastic build otherwise!
batman
It’s all fun and games until the battery dies on the controllers💀
Thats realy cool
Did anyone else notice he looks like Thomas from Maze Runner
You're out here living my childhood dreams. One thing I always wanted to build was a LEGO arcade claw machine game... I feel like if anyone could do it, it'd be you.
Ahhhhhhhh! Green Goblin! 6:34
have you ever made a claw machine if not you should
hi

Add a slot for quarters where you pay and it comes back out the lower area like you won the game
Now, try building an EXA Arcadia cabinet of sorts with legos!
Imagine someone winning a fortnite tournament by playing on this
Love that shirt
The wobble right after he said "that's so cool" 😂😂😂😂
why didn't he just use an old NES?
oooo nice arcade machine you have there.  Can I have it?
This is sc=uch a cool arcade, and it's mordern with a PS5 too!
4:15 15bucks for a tv give me the garage sale rn
Wait, brick science, aren’t you technically not making a working Lego arcade machine cause your also using a controller
What about charging it😮😢
How is he gonna change the controller batteries 🤔🤔🤔
There are problems with the controller setup I think he could figure out a way to have the controller be right side up but all in all awesome build
Make a life size version of yourself
great job! it looks amazing
the origin of lego games:
When the controller runs out of battery 😢
Play ultimate chicken horse
There is no way i could build anything close to this and the fact that this guy spends most of his day making things like this is amazing 🙃
Is it okay if you build the world's biggest boxing glove out of red and white Legos
You should do a full sized Lego pool table
its all fun and games until he needs to charge the controller of reconect it
WOW😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 NICE
Aria? That’s the name of the rouge AI in the movie “Eagle Eye”!
Bro I subscribed love your builds amazing ❤
7:16 they don't put steel frames on it, they glue the bricks together
If you make a dispenser I will subscribe and like
Xbox is better!!!!!!!!
bro there are to arcades in your lego room
This arcade machine is valid!
Bro don't even know how to build with duplo meanwhile I'm  making a vault that actually works at 7 years old
I love your channel it inspired me to create my channel about Lego unfortunly  I don't  have a lot of subscribers.
Bro the amount of effort
Dude that’s so cool what you can do with Lego keep it up 👍
Ne nieter😂
Bro should be not this underrated!
He's a magician with lego😅
I really want to make that but I don't have enough lego pieces
I don’t know how you do it but it always turns out so well❤❤
(Suggestion) show how you make it
Your Arcade Machine is great!
Should I get the lego Titanic or the lego Eiffel Tower?     Btw amazing arcade machine👏
kj
How is no one talking about the crazy amount of patience this legend had to have to place bricks for that long? This is underrated content.
11:00 Bro really said where's my hammeh?  👴🏼
question is can I play Call of Duty
I love watching brick science and so do my kids in fact, my kids idolize him and when they grew up, they wanna be like him.
I'm more surprised he got a tv for 15$
The effort he puts to the LEGO creations are just amazing!!!💯💯
Please play fortnite on this
and boom it breaks-riley 11/25/2023 at 1:37
why you steal ben shapiro voice 😭😭😭
How do u charge the controllers inside
Never told us about the ps5button
The inverted buttons are triggering my OCD btw you should make some videos on the other channel and you should make more panels
Too bad Opera's broken.
this is impressive.
This is the coolest Lego video I ever saw
whatever Xbox you like
maybe like with the 360 or Series X
What if you make a Xbox version
15:51 this would have been a w opportunity.
there's acatully no ps5 arcade but ah yo was that sick
Bro your so creative and good in lego i hope i can be like you 😍❤️ ig you know any website that can ship LEGO star wars or something else to the middle east to Lebanon plsss tell me)
ps5 access controller: let me introduce myself

His next video: I built a Lego PS5!

This  would  have  token  me 10 years  for  me to finish  this!
Is this based off rjm bricks?
Make a Lego gaming pc, just a Lego case I guess but it’ll be cool. Probably
I actually use Opera daily.😂
Imagine an earthquake🫥
Try to beat The World Record for The biggest flag made of Lego
this man belongs on lego masters
I have been to an arcade in Oregon though I am in Washington.
Make a Lego working umbrella!
12:31
Tv for £15 🤯
He’s Use PS5 to make arcade machine
Batman
Flipping the controllers upside down was a 200IQ move
You should make a full sized Lego pool table
You should make shorts to popularize the Lego room so everyone know your doing it and more people will watch the videos
1 hour gang
Dang I want one
Put the playstacion sideways beacuse if you dont the liquid metal will melt and brace other component
That is INSANEEEEE WOW it looks AMAZING!! You are a MASTER BUILDER
😅
SSSSSSiiicccckkkk
The fact that this guy has every single brick planned out this is insanely impressive.
And if you want to play all day just make a gaming chair
Denver
Whay does 'john' mean in his description?
❤❤❤

Lego room
Hi brick sciences, are you able to Build a pistol with legos? Best regards
Thats really cool and cleaver, but damn hows that nerdy guy know such a hot chick.
Hey guys I’m trying to be able to stream so I’d really appreciate any new subscribers, thanks! 😊
When glueing lego is legal be like
If he keeps going like this next up is gonna be a working Lego keyboard and mouse.
Now you sell this as a set for $10k and I’m sure a lotta people will buy it
This is a great build! Keep it up!
you are a very talented at this stuff. keep it up
Bro what if a controller dies😭
goated video dude! You're such a creative person in the lego community😮, love to see more kind of videos like this in the future😊
yoooooo 2:33
We had a case like this for my original Nintendo with a tv in 89 we had it for over 15 yrs in our living room it was awesome!
At this point he is gonna make a whole entire working lego car 😨😨
I would love too see him redesign it with all of the buttons in mind because this is such a cool idea!!
sony should pay him
This is huge and awesome your a legend
imagine rage quitting on it.
You should have just used wires for the controllers
W content
Using longer legos more than 2×4 is structural more stable. Use 2×8 for your walls.
REALY REALY COOL!!!!!!!!
Awesome I decided to do that with the switch🙂
Red, white, blue, America!
You can also make it sturdy by using bracing in your build.
Cool and plus I also try to recreate some of your projects I think there really inspiring
Can you make a Lego omnitrix
Next, make a nuke missile out of legos that uses actual Uranium.
Build a life size vending machine
I love that your back
Love the content keep up the hard work👍
Looks awesome The pacman set in the background 👍
Siht saw looc
Coolest thing ever
OMG that was amazing and crazy but you could of put the PS5 on the floor so it won’t fall off the stable it was on but overall it was a 1000000000000000000000000000/10000 like it should be in the museum of LEGO.❤❤❤❤😮😮😮🎉🎉
Absolutely amazing! I love how you built the control console, and nice steal on the tv!
❤❤😂😂🎉🎉🎉😢😢😮😮😅😊
You’ve outdone yourself!
I like the shirt
Bro you deserve a oscar
I Love the video and good job and I'm wish I could build like that I am shocked 🤯
👌
You should build a Lego game chair for it
lego
you should try out for Lego masters.
Can we play Minecraft
Interesting, you da best GG
Wait wait wait… why did I hear ball guys 😢
They should hire you for legoland
Riley in 2 months: I made a functioning PC completely out legos!
Heyo
Could you add the outher joystick
Wow I wish I could build that I mean I could but I don’t have the bricks
Wait the TV is just like ours
You are the best builder ever seen
Don't some games require both sticks?
Ok
It's so cool that the room was all Lego! I am a Lego person as well and... I have no words.
The sister tho-
This is my best view ever seen
I love this machine
when the controller runs out of battery:
You should move the PS five to the right and put a mini fridge in the bottom  Then a Lego door opening the mini fridge
W vid
Brick science empire 👇             And please make a 5 player arcade machine I've seen one irl And fav best build of yours *ever*
I love your videos Riley    😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀
Do you ever get bored building over and over❓
glue.
you are the best IMPOSSIBLE LEGO BUILDER!
i play brawlhalla and fall guys too
I'm more impressed by the girl to be honest
Awesome job!
what abour the D-pad for games like teardown
this is amazing but how are you gonna charge the controllers without messing up the board
Do you know that they put the blue bricks inside the big model structure for saving bricks?
I do that all the time 10:21
Suggestion: when you take out a panel, try to customize it to slowly make your room look cooler and cooler as time goes by. Great video!
this is the equivalent to not all legos are for kids
You should have gotten the Lego dimensions starter pack for PS4 so the PS5 can play it and incorporate the toy pad (yes it is Lego as well) into the arcade cabinet.
Xbox series X watching from the corner: "dear Neptune I'm next aren't I?..."
How do you build this!
You are an absolute genius. Subscribed and liked.
Where can i get that shirt
What about L2,R2,R3,L3,options,share,the big button and home button no hate ❤ u

DOPLO is not Lego!!!
How about a mini one using remote play?
I meant to say duplo
Diploma sssssssssssssssuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuukkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkksssssssssssssssss
"I Beat Minecraft on my Custom LEGO PS5 Arcade Machine!" Some customizing recommended but it could be done.

So awesome.   ^^
This is honestly amazing
FIRST PLAN THEN BUILD!!!!!!!!!
Bro how do you build sick stuff like this
MAKE A LEGO CHAIR
People who use opera gx ⬇️
Love your work brick science, keep building!
You are amazing!
I imagine god of war on there would be extremely hard bc you basically need to click almost every button at once.
pls build an simracing setup out of Lego
Can you join lego masters?
This is insane!
It is today
Who uses opera 👇
Ight lego take notes  Make this a lego set
Sir you belong in lego😂
You should name it PS PLayer
Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuui
Suuuuuup
Who is your editor?
This dude gonna have lego animatronics in a few months
Bro your so sigma😎🍷
Always love it when he puts out another one of his lego sorcery videos. I mean, seriously, HOW? You do such a great job, these all look and work amazing. Keep it up!
this is looks like ash ketchum arcade machine
That's amazing!!
coool:D:D:D:D
This was actually really sick. The arcade machine is HUGE, and it's so cool that you integrated machinery to it. There is only one more sentence to say...    WELCOME, TO BRAWLHALLA!
This is SO AMAZING! You should actually be on lego masters! It would be awesome!
jesus is lord of lords
This is insane
WHY AREN’T YOU A MASTERBUILDER YET!!! LEGO is missing out on your talent sir!
This one is special!
Make a separate video when you make a Spider-Man control panel
Has this guy ever heard of universal joints they take way less parts and space
Your cracked at Fortnite my guy
I've always wanted to build a Lego Arcade Machine when I was younger So seeing it actually realized is kind of a childhood dream come true
this was so fun to watch it was amazing it makes me wish that icould make this
Best lego build I've seen in years
How would you play Hogwarts legacy? You didn’t make a mechanic for the R2 button. That’s the only game I play on the PS5 besides Spider-Man Miles Morales.
Sweet "shock" bonus.
Good work👍
do a lego controller where you take all the wiring put it in lego controller (or simpler build around it like the wii controller) and make extentions
When u get angry and kick it
Skibidi
But I liked my own comment 😅
Why didn’t you apply for Lego masters yiu would’ve made the top quick
Help me be the most liked comment🎉🎉🎉
nice arcade machine!!.
Is the girl your girlfriend ??? And btw W vid
Brick science bought a PS5 for the video 🗿
Watches this from start to finish and was invested the whole way through This was such a fun "dream build" that many of us have fantasized about but will never be able to truly accomplish Hats off to you for this build this was truly an awesome build and video to watch
I wach this and its a AMAZING KEEP UP THE WORK 🎉🎉🎉
isnt that sponsor just opera gx but for work?
His shirt is great
Something you can do is remap the stick so that you can have the controls inverted.
What happens when the controllers die
he needs to play fortnite on the arcade
fntastic idea but how are you supost to charge the controlers ?
This going to be sick
Like this video if you love PS5
Very amazing🎉
If this arcade machine was at my local arcade, I would play on this ALL DAY LONG!!
Brickscince is a genius and a lego master mind
I got a antman quantumania ad before this and it ruined me day
Yo that was Epic!!!
You are freaking Amazing, and really Cool too! Why doesn't Lego have real Talent like you?
I have more an 4000 or 3000 legos and I still can’t make something like that!!! But I love it
Bro you have way to much lego
today i watched tons of your videos, old ones and new ones
Let’s go keep the work up
😮😮😮😮 cool
Great video as always mate your arcade machine looks awesome😊👍👍

Imagine building your dream car out of Lego that is drivable. By the way, nice arcade machine.
I love your videos ❤❤❤
The next video gonna be about arcade chairs
Ham burber
Why has LEGO not hired you yet.
Suggestion: leave your ps5 sideways because up and down slowly kills it because of gravity and Liquid Metal.
The ONLY Man who can do this and still make it interesting thank you for this wonderful video Riley.
If you flip the colors on the PS logo the LEDs will pop more.
this makes me want to do this with my ps5
