Hello I just wanted to tell you that Jesus loves you and he wants a relationship with you. If you are willing to give your life to him and follow him then he will transform your life into something greater than you can ever imagine. Make sure to obey him and strive to be like him in all his ways and he will give you the gift of heaven. In Jesus' name I pray that you will accept him, Amen

Deuteronômio 31  Depois foi Moisés, e falou estas palavras a todo o Israel, E disse-lhes: Da idade de cento e vinte anos sou eu hoje; já não poderei mais sair e entrar; além disto o Senhor me disse: Não passarás o Jordão. O Senhor teu Deus passará adiante de ti; ele destruirá estas nações de diante de ti, para que as possuas; Josué passará adiante de ti, como o Senhor tem falado. E o Senhor lhes fará como fez a Siom e a Ogue, reis dos amorreus, e à sua terra, os quais destruiu. Quando, pois, o Senhor vo-los der diante de vós, então com eles fareis conforme a todo o mandamento que vos tenho ordenado. Esforçai-vos, e animai-vos; não temais, nem vos espanteis diante deles; porque o Senhor teu Deus é o que vai contigo; não te deixará nem te desamparará. E chamou Moisés a Josué, e lhe disse aos olhos de todo o Israel:

I want my own PC. It’s my dream. Not a prebuilt one — I want to build it myself. Pick every part, make it truly mine. I want to play DOOM and other heavy games on max settings with no lag. I want to sit at my desk, put on my headphones, and fully dive into the game. It’s not just a machine — it’s my goal, my tool, my way to relax and grow. I’m ready to save up, wait, and work for it. I want it more than anything.

"Hey Karl I love your videos a lot  I’m trying to build my first PC, so i can play minecraft but my budget is super tight. If you have any i7 12700 CPUs you don’t need, I’d really appreciate it! No worries if not, just wanted to ask. Keep up the awesome work!"
deadass I would buy the 100 dollar computer if it would perform that well when actually recording on it.
Bro my pc is only 300$ worth but it's way better than your 5000$ pc😅
100 dollar pc better than my pc😢

Värd en kommentar!😮😂😂❤😂🎉🎉😢😮🎉😂❤
can you gift me the 5.000$ computer :D?
The test for the $1 computer would eventually crash any computer, including the desk build from LTT. That is unless its power scaled with stress, kinda like the hulk lol, and even then, power is finite. The national grid would eventually crash, so power plants would have to be able to indefinitely sustain exponential power generation, for which you would literally need to harness and recycle all energy universally.
OMG I HAVE THE 100 ONEE
bro watched the minecraft movie before it was released

Hello, I hope you’re doing well. I’m a student passionate about learning programming and pursuing my dreams, but financial challenges are holding me back from getting a PC. Having one would be a game-changer for my studies and would help me kickstart my journey into programming and content creation, which has always been a dream of mine.  I’ve also tried starting a YouTube channel, but I’ve struggled to make progress due to the lack of proper equipment. If there’s any way you could help, it would truly mean the world to me.  Thank you for all the incredible work you do and for inspiring so many people around the world!

Карл пропустил все позможные варианты с бедного компа за 100$ до 5000$ на котором уже можно играть в CyberPunk. Столько наигранных эмоций, особенно где шейдеры, будто парень никогда шейдеры не видел. Уверен что компьютер НЕ СТОИЛ 100,000$, потому что можно купить компьер за 5000$ и этого вполне хватит
Я играю с компьютером за0.50 центов
$100k pc with wired mouse Bruh! seriously?

components? (Just kidding but if someone wants to tell me or Karl it wouldn't bother me)
Ain't no way an 100,000$ dollar PC only gets you 80 fps in a Minecraft mod. You could have spent like 35,000$ with the right equipment and gotten a PC capable of around 1000fps with those same mods.

Hello
que jamás se crashea dice...se nota que no has jugado VRChat xD
В Minecraft надо поставить для таких PC выше 120 fps в настройках
mi pregunta es, que componentes tiene? enserio, pa ese precio no creo que tenga una 4090 y un i9 no es tan caro y no creo que tenga un nvidia hoper h100, un intel gaudi2 o amd un mi300 (rondan los 30000 dolares) ya que esta mas optimizado a centros de datos tampoco creo que tenga un procesador cuantico, xq no hay sistema operativo dedicado a videojuegos para este y tampoco uno fotonico ya que esos componentes aun no se venden (aunque recien se estan empezando a vender a base de datos)
Me darías la PC de 100 dólares.

Hey Karl, if the low-performance PC is no longer useful to you, give it a miss 🥹🤧 mine is a piece of junk 🥹🤧🤌🏻😩Minecraft barely runs, technically I only have to watch how other players play and as a spectator, when they were going to buy my PC I thought that It would be good but anyway my grandparents have little money and I don't feel bad on the contrary I feel happy but sometimes I would like to play but the PC doesn't measure up 🤭🥹🤧 I tried to play Fornite but it doesn't even let me enter hahaha that's bad for me but anyway I guess the comment It will be lost among the others. I speak in Spanish but I translated it into English and maybe you will see it but it is just an illusion of mine but you know I prefer to have that illusion. Maybe you will see it or maybe they will make fun of me, even if it is, I know that. I tried it suerte para mí 😊
Please translate your videos into Russian

Came here after Linus's video building this system. And I will say, I wont be back. Not only did you barely even show what Linus made for you in your 8 minute video, this was boring. I've never heard of you and now I know why. No appreciation for the work that went into this build at all
Super computer
Bro one thing I noticed is that the 100k has lower fps than the 25k
Yoo share denzel your freind from good news

Do you have a pc
I’m here in 2024 /08/24
i am Bangladesh  man i❤u video 🎉i❤u mr best
Ayyyy uhh could I have one of those pcs
the 15 year old laptop is laggy because you used the highest settings possible, and you used windows 10.
What the actual fuck how pc for 100.000$ has 90 fps?????
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13kFgAnYeA&t
Quick question, what operating systems do the computers use? I've seen 1.75-2x increase in FPS from Windows to Linux, and I think the FPS would have been higher with atleast Artix or Alpine Linux.. By the way, I'm only at the 100 dollar PC timestamp.
Karl, Wow, this made my day brighter! Thank you!
literally my pc
Dislike for not showing specs
if only they used linux
My Amazon table which is 5 year olds is better than the 100k computer

Isn’t George older then carl
Wow, the difference between these setups is mind-blowing! 💻 I'm curious how they'd perform in real-world tasks like video editing or gaming. I recently made a video testing out a budget build, and seeing this makes me want to push my setup even further. Would love to hear your thoughts on it! 🚀

$1 laptop? really? looks like you're learning how to lie to get views like Mr Beast. Nobody is selling a working laptop for $1, that's a bullcrap story just like the $1 island that Mr Beast bought. Lies.
The 100k texture pack is like the graphics of rdr2
🤨
I love the fact that the upgrade from $100 to a $5000 without even mentioning about the $2000 or the $4000

cool bro
necesitamos que tus videos esten en español
you can already kinda tell sometimes that the minecraft isnt running actually on the device like on the 2nd computer that they showed the minecraft infomation thingy showed a i7-9750h which is a laptop cpu so they probably ran the game on a laptop that was hidden. The pc that was suppost to run minecraft wasnt even being used and the cpu of that computer is probably worse than the first device that they showed
i love you

fun fact: 5k pc has the same specs as the 100k one but 100k has really good features with better cooling and the performance should be close

at 1:45 Karl cursed MrBeasts gaming channel and thats why they havnt uploaded since
They finally upgraded the texture pack in the $100,000 PC they didn't for every other computer before then just the final PC
Loving the regular Karl videos
Eventhough im using Probook 4520s HP . I have to minimize Roblox's Window to play smoothly . i'm still happy  with it bc i have a laptop while some people don't
Nahhhh that last pc is a nasa pc💀💀💀💀
The 5000 one is me dream
Ltt's video on the last pc was amazing. He put so much work and effort for that pc and even went abit over the budget.
Let’s share our thoughts on the message of the video.
change your PFP NOW
The optiplex desktop platform, even the old ones are extremely versatile for light gaming like minecraft. I used to have one and I upgraded the CPU in it for no more than like $5 and put an Nvidia GT730 in it and it ran EXTREMELY well. 60+ FPS. For something like 200-300 bucks max you can make a system that runs well with a dedicated graphics card
“Oh my gyat”is making me Laugh so bad😂 8:12
My pc worth only 50 bucks lol 😅

🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🚗🚗
This is supposed to be a computer video why did it turn into a full on Minecraft video instead 😂😂😂
No way the 1$ laptop is better than mine. ( I run 5-3 fps while looking at the ground at the lowest settings )
Can you give me a PC?
So this is why the Mr. Beast Gaming Channel hasn’t been uploading. Karl botched his computer 😂
Casual mrbeast video
Im not even joking my uncle has had  the world record of building pcs alot of times (not to be that guy)
Karl gay
How long have you been following this channel? I just discovered it!
my laptop is 15y old too and i cannot even run minecraft too bruh

They still kept the Linus selfie background💀
That 100 dollar computer does not have an i7-9750h in it. That old dell is from like 2008 at the newest, plus the 9750h is a laptop cpu.
Bro computer 1 dolar In Indonesia as bad
Still remembered.

hi jarl i am a fan

I love how fake this is. The "100" dollar computer was literally worse than the "1" dollar laptop, and also it wasn't even being used lmao. They used a 9th gen laptop instead of it (Which is more like worth around 350). This is literally such a dumb video.
Bro is turning into mr beast
I just did one but just with AI. on my video
watch the build was awesome
100 dollar pc better than mie
1 bucks would do that and sell it for 15 bucks
tbh I wish I had that $100 computer
The *real* way to destroy the $100,000 PC. 1. Load into BeamNG 2. Download thousands of mods and pick an extremely demanding map 3. Spawn traffic 4. Spawn hundreds of mod cars that are extremely demanding 5. Make a huge pileup 6. Watch the frames drop.
I love Karl
🏳️‍⚧️
I would have loved to hear the specs of the computers.
bro $100 one isnt that bad tbh
1 q
how you go from 100 to 5000 !?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
the 100k cost alot not because of the parts but cause of the desk, the parts on their own are like 5k
Bruh if i had the 100k i woukd get mad at the game then accidetnaly break the glass pc

MRKARL PLS GIVE ME A PC IM STUCK WITH MY 200$ PC😭
they go from 100 to 5000 dollar pc lol
When you rage on the 100 thousand dollar pc🫡🫡🫡
7:26 Rest in peace Frank, you will be missed :(
the 100,00 computer was built by LTT XDD
Karl mrbeast acaba de pasar a t-series
the fact that you jumped from 100 to 5000 made the entire video pointless
my pc exploded while watching this video very nice
The 1 dollar laptop is better then my laptop and I find that crazy
Question to Karl , are you using $100,000 computer daily or selling it off??
4:53 nice pc
uh karl what about the specs
hey the 100 dollar computer justs needs a good gpu, it already has a good (a little old) cpu
Is good i am good to buid mine own

To be fair some pcs are worse than the 5k gaming pc he showed like the 2k gaming pc but modifing your settings can make your fps jump to thousands like 1k or 2k some people have 10k
Why is nobody talking about that 5k pc got i9 10900k with a 3090, which is a huge bottleneck💀
Karl you are cool.

So now Karl is even ripping jimmy off?
can you buy me a 100,000 computer
Hold on, you are gonna tell me for 100 euro I can get a PC with a 12 core i7 9th gen?? That seems too good to be true tbh. Also, the second test should've been more intensive than the third, as it would get laggier exponentionally. But what surprises me the most, is that you managed to lag a 20 core i9 and a rtx 3090 with just minecraft. Ridiculoud (i bet you used some artificial way to lag the computer (also why did you blur the framerate in f3 lol) sorry for this but I just had to say it, don't get me wrong, it is a cool vid!

ltt did a realy great job at building that
How did you make the 100k pc look like shit in the showcase

why does tnt make a computer crash?
When you pressed f3 on the $100 pc, it said it had a core i7 9750h. Which is a 12 core processor, which costs $228 new.
NOLANS MOM IS GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
SSICKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Love how Karl has his own time to film his own videos even though he works for MrBeast
Stress testing a 100k computer... By blowing up tnt in Minecraft...  Could not think of a more dumb test that is very much single threaded and is also largely down to how the game schedules explosions over multiple ticks instead of exploding them all at once...
5000 at least have a 4070 and i9 core man that’s bullshit
Skips right past the 500 1000 and 2000 dollar PC. The main ones people use

FRANK, NOoOoOoOOo 7:25
the first pc actually has a graphics card,  but an integrated one. theres no pc without a gpu, cause it wont work without one
From my point of view, the budget PC should be optimized. I was able to run GTA V at 45 fps on a VERY WEAK laptop(Pentium 4 and gt720m) Idk why did I do this, because then I had a powerful PC (I'm sorry, but I sitting trough a translator)

So rich guy 100000$ PC i have 100$ pc :)
I don't believe you bought that garbage computer for $1 and you can't find that price in third world countries either. I guess this is a lie or a clickbait just to gain more views with that kind of hype.
meanwhile the CameraMan is just recording the whole scene very smoothly
my pc craches watching this video

he wasnt testing , he was playing
Loving the regular Karl uploads
I was surprised to hear that the author of the video found a computer on sale for just $1! It's probably a very simple and basic option, but it's still impressive. On the other hand, I was surprised to learn that a $100,000 computer is capable of such powerful and complex work. This proves that technology continues to evolve and improve our lives. Thank you so much for the video! Very interesting and dynamic. I wish you even more subscribers and views
Yt Alexthegamer

#problems0
If you got a pc for 5000$ what this bad... I feel sorry for ya
anything after the 5000 computer is the exact same because frame rates are from the graphics card which is used and the 100k was just for pc being in the table
Keep up the good work!! Deserving for a sub. The vids that i make hopefully gets to your level. Thank you

I really like this video. Thank you very much
BRO 🤯literally he blured that part where the fps are shown in f3 he just showed it for 1 second when the fps where low Broo the $5000 pc has a RTX 3090 no way it would crash like that. Its a 100% scripted cz RTX 3090 could never crash like that.
day 1 of asking for an 5K PC
it is easy to crash the $100,000 PC just play on minecraft bedrock and summon like thousands of withers
why did the $25000 at it max said 120 fps
yo  can i get a pc
Please give me a pc 🙏
this video almost crashed my computer
such a coincidence in 1:40 they havent uploaded in 7 months
My computer is the one dollar "pc"
You make a video about computers but don't mention the specs once? And only test Minecraft when there are much more demanding games? This might well be the worst video I've ever seen
5000€ for a rtx 3090 and i9 man that's expensive
please karl do a giveaaway i use a junk
i am so poor:( please a pc or laptop or computer i am from germany
Can you give me your computer 😊

i hate minecraft texture

People who was watching Mr beast 👇
MRBEAST IS ALSO GOOD
they spent 5k for the actual pc and 95k for the rest of build of this 100k pc and prob they didnt want to spend any more money and got some trash pc-s from garbage and compared with this 5kpc+95k wastepc
Bro thinks he´s Karl from MrBeast
Love fake reactions and clickbait!  Computers can't even realistically get up to 100k
u can find a pc that has the same specs for 5k  wth
The $10 computer is even better than mine😂
Bro minecraft sucks u should play harder games
If you are a human, like my comments.
no 500 dollar? 1000 dollar? 2500? the jump from 100 to 5000 is honestly insane. Thats going from a trash pc to a perfect pc for basically anything
ну ты карл молодец
aint no way you got that laptop for 1 dollar. Might as well give it away for free lol.
Even with the best hardware out there you will not reach 100k for a gaming pc.
these guys testing PCs with minecraft... bruh.
wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's funny that my pc of $650 gets better frames in Minecraft with the same shaders and texture packs just because of 7 or 8 optimization mods
Dubingkan ke bahasa Indonesia karena sebagian dari kita belum bisa memahami bahasa anda topong ya🎉😂❤❤❤❤❤
better than beast
i have 200$ and i play minecarft with 400 FPS

Nah bro how does a 5k pc crash from minecraft
Wow, Karl! I wish I had a computar like that. Maybe I can sell my kidney and buy one. You are the best, Karl. Love from Kidney
Cool
Hi
these are just mr beast videos with karls face... wtf
If you're actually looking for a good PC, I'd suggest checking out Build Pro PC. I have been using my PC from then for over a year, and I can strongly recommend them with confidence.
if u wanna do an actual comparison buy a capture card and maybe lower the graphics if ur not dumb
I can see why George is with Karl and not Dream
Mr beast should  do this 😂
I once played with a computer which made 0 fps :) , explanation: it survives the game but it gave me 1 image over 2 or maybe 3 seconds and without knowing better I still played that. Imagine playing Starcraft II with that :)
Please upload video also in hindi
wtf how does a 100$ computer has an i7-9750H it shouldn't lag that much then?
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/EgLXQPyOFW0

Cause .... Capitalism & Materialism.
I don't know why YouTube recommend you to me  I wanted to tell you Darkest bit of hell has opened to swallow you all so keep the devil waiting

That 100$ pc is better than my 500$ laptop
Gay 😂
I have the 1 dollar laptop😭
The $100,000 is actually around as powerful as a $5000 computer. It just has an expensive desk case, tons of water cooling, and many overpriced/useless parts. For example, that machine likely has way more RAM than minecraft needs. Completely useless.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
anyone notice that the $100 pc if you Google the specs it has a core 2 duo but in Minecraft it had a i7 9750h?
He really bought a 100000 dollar computer for like 3 minutes of content…
hi Karl! During my illness, all I do is watch your videos. I love you very much ❤! and I really hope that you will read TV and respond to this comment! with love Nastya 💗
What’s the song ? 7:34
the performance doesnt get better after u spend 5k cause a 4090 + 13900k build costs 5k prebuilt im pretty sure
Nu ty urod, svoroval prevyushku u windy31, urod

Sup boso
Wow there was a 5000% jump from the second and third
So can you gift me the 100k setup =) I'm a good boy and i'm broke to even afford 100 dollar pc setup
ridiculous how many hits you can get and how rich just by being part of another team that already makes and spends money on bs. i wouldn't even waste time with the YT videos, just live off him instead. especially considering these videos are shit
Bro Should've went on the top of the mansion when he was against Nolan bc Nolan never blew up the top mod the Mansion
Karl, I’ll give you 100 dollars for the 100,000 dollar PC please!!! It’ll be my very first computer to be able to play games on
George was found💀
Plz help me plz

هدت كرنج وقاي يحيى رقم 2
my mum has the first one
No one cares  odjdidjxjicjdid
i am called linus as well
my pc better no cap
100k on a PC has a gigantic amount of diminishing returns for sure.  In fact, 100k goes far past that and is at negative returns.  You're probably probably aware that your PC capped out on tech capability at around 10k.  The remaining 90k is probably spent on casing and embelishments
wish i had a pc
wish i had that 5K pc tbh
Can i mabye get a pc please
If i had 5000 to build a computer, minecraft would NOT crash it, trust me.

ngl for a price of 100 dollar computer that shit runs smooth
i perfectly got a pixel playground ad before i got this vid :D
Karl: I actually got this PC from Mr. Beast gaming, so if it crashes, I hope Mr. Beast gaming never uploads again.  Mr. Beast Gaming:
I get 60 FPS with sodium and c2e and continuity and more:(
7:30 what's that song again? I forgoooooooooot but I love it
try and see if it can withstand getting chunk banned
😡😡😠😠😠😠😠😠🤬🔞❌gay
gay stop uploading vids
I’m glad his vacation helped him. He looks rejuvenated and happy hopp he get diare  och skiter i sängen prutt och hej
ngl 100k pc at the best graphics and rtx shaders and the best graphics should have around  140-280 fps and when i mean the heaviest shaders and THE BEST i mean it
25k and still only at 120 fps? bru
Karl if you read my comment I angry to you I'm very angry say to Chris I hate her now
i got more fps than 5k dollar pc on my 600$ custom pc
I watched how the 100k pc was made
VWNEANS
Imagine they test that on cyberpunk 2077 path tracing IMAGINE
love the scene with clair de lune playing
Omg that Linus computer 🤤. Being a computer nerd this was my favorite versus video ever ❤
Bro i wish to own at least a $1 pc 😢
пон
you gay!!!
Exposed!!!! i have the very model of Toshiba laptop portege and I can get 180fps ((with perfomnce mods) and render distance at 7)on it, it was made in 2015 so DAH its slow but the Toshibas are good laptops. And its not 15 years old as it running windows 7
karl your laugh is goofy
I didn't knew , Mr. Beast had a son
School's computers is better than the 1st computer 💀
If you really wanted to crash those PC's so badly, maybe you shouldn't have waited until the 100k PC to use Minecraft shaders.
Nah 5k pc was so bad how
i hate chris
Only 90 FPS on a 4090? Wtf??? Also 5000 Could easily be the same as the 25000, you cant cap the 4090.
So the $1 laptop is 65,000 times better value for money
how did bro get an i7-9750h for $100
THE
bye may a pc pls
Tareq is so humble ( I may have misspelled his name)
Hii i am from India I will subscribe your channel and you will give me 10000 money😊❤

Honestly, Linus spent so much time on that PC, just for it to be in a video for like 2 minutes 💀
I hate Chris Tyson
Mr whew february
21 fps with a $5000 pc make no sense, even with all the tnt.

bro the 1$ computer has 20 seconds per frame
What's so cool about a game that looks from the 90s ..😂

karl is the best i hope you succses!!!! have a good day im just a poor guy:(
this video needs to get 20 million views
Mr. Beats No Post Vedio 😢
this is how u bully ur pc
I came to this video from Linus Tech Tips. What makes the computer so expensive is that it is in a desk, not the components inside. I think if they maxed everything out using two of the strongest pc components I think the computer could be stronger.
The first computer can't even survive just one tnt😂
Tareq hasn’t played Minecraft and I’m 7 and I have played minecraft
Karl  and  mrbeast  my 😂
hey wassup man! i dare you to eat stuff from only gas stations for a day, AND NO JUNK FOOD ALLOWED!!
"has no gpu" *preceeds to open minecraft*
on the high end one (5k) where you using all the ram or was it set to the default limit? Also what about shaders? On Java. There are. Path traced one’s
What was the ram on the last computer?
го перевод на руский карл
Wait a sec that George not found
Honestly expected worse for the first computer and better for the second one
Bro the 1$ laptop is as bad as my cousins “NASA laptop”
Ha 100k pc only giving 85 fps??? Atleast i can expect 1000 fps from it
Gimpy rich kids being toxic about framerates on minecraft, man why did linus go anywhere near these pubes?
Ur chocolates came to tasmaina on the 23 of sep 2023 I was the first person ever to try it in tasmaina we only tried the nut one my mum ate the Deeznuts one it only taste like peanut butter but it's awesome I should make one named Mr beast loves his fans
Topic for next video.  Our custom build 10million pc.
Iphone or Samsung
Karl’s videos make me lose brain cells in an unironic way.
Bro image you have 100K computer
YOU KNOW THESE COMMENTS MIGHT BE REAL BUT KARL IS STILL A BAD YOUTUBE PROLLY THE MOST UNFUNIEST TOO ITS A FACT NOT AN OPINION
The pc parts cost only 5 grand. The other 95.000$ were invested into the desk
The fact you can run like 2k+ fps if you do optimizations if you need help am always up lol
EGOREK.
The computer to not do😊
The last world is a mod
Please show the specification
🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿
I cant play Minecraft in my laptop
Umm mr beast pc thats sounds good and my dream
That $100 pc actually did pretty well. I wish I knew what pc to buy to play Minecraft full render and no lag but still trying to stay maximum under 2000

Gay
Mr beast jr?
So apparently,my computer is not even worth $1

Karl should have placed two command blocks on repeat one that commands /kill @e and the other summon ended dragon bc of all the xp orbs destruction and entity spawn
Привет классно видео
W KARL AND W LINUS!!!
I want 1 solar laptop
I'm curious as to why the $100 PC has a 9th gen i7 which also happens to be a laptop CPU? The i7-9750H was a high performance laptop chip when it came out and it usually was paired with a dedicated GPU in laptops. It seems like the IGPU was used intentionally.
hey can i have the 100k pc this can be taken as a joke or fr but im in both i need ab better pc
6:10 name of the texture pack someone?
Karl pls give me 5k dollars PC . My PC Minecraft 30 fps
Yo aqui con mi pc del gobierno bien gracias xd

Thank you karl!
Karl the best!!
Hello, Carl! I'm from Russia, I wanted to tell you that Russian fans of Mr. Beast like you!! you are the best, baby, never be sad, when Jimmy's English fans hate you, then at this time the Russians love you very much, and in general you are a bunny and very cute!!! we love you!! (your mom too))). the translation was done with the help of a translator     привет, Карл! я из России, я хотела передать, что ты нравишься русским фанатам мистера биста!! ты самый лучший, пупсик никогда не грусти, когда тебя хейтят английские фанаты, то в это время русские очень сильно любят тебя и вообще ты зайка  и очень милый!!! мы любим тебя!! (твою маму тоже))). перевод сделан с помощью переводчика
Karl you're doing great, this is a very big sum of money for me, it's cool, it's serizna thank you for the content

I love Carl's mom

That’s 100 dollar pc wasn’t even that bad actually
I'm the only one who sees that the 100$ computer has an i7 9th gen and a 1080p display?
Just so you know alot of the quick edits of the real looking explosion sparks some of them actually originate from the little girl who was filming a makeup video (9 years of  age at the time) whos house exploaded in a gas fire who died. Everytime I see those sparks it reminds me of that video :(.
Can you gift me 1 computer

Hey Karl, my computer is actually a second gen $5 computer without a graphic card and I just used it to watch, like and subscribe to your channel 😃. I'm a huge fan of your work, Mr. Beast and LTT as well and I love the $100,000 custom computer built for you by Linus 😉
Korl
0:19 you think this is bad? my computer takes 9-10 seconds before showing the next frame
the f3 menu decreases fps

the fact that 80% of people compuiter range from 300 tu 2000$
my pc is thost machine
But it isn't a 100k computer and I dont think this dude even bought the computer... you all are fawing over a liar. Somebody who will lie to your face if he feels it benefits him and you are praising him. We live in a sad sad world.
Where did you get that helicopter mod
Where did this guy get a good computer for 100$ and record Minecraft Java Edition mine is more than 100 dollars yet I get 15 fps without recording with sodium and other fps mods

its hard to believe that these pcs are at these frames mostly the expensive ones
How much does mrbeast pay you??
How is all the laptops have your main acc?
Karl is GREAT just like camman18
Instead of using F3, try using MSI Afterburner because the F3 menu actually takes up power from your client's performance. This usually isn't the case for higher end computers, plus OBS or any other recording software can put some HEAVY lag on your game. I recommend using external devices or putting it on a LAN server with a separate client instead of ReplayMod so the testing client doesn't get put on more pressure from mods.  Someone get me to the top so Karl sees this comment and puts this into account
just cuz you had a good pc doesnt mean you get a better minecraft lol xd🤣🤣
bruh the helicopter helicopter shoots better quality exloding tnt bruh
Hi can we trade iwill give you 15k dollars and give me ur account

Hello Karl. I love you🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
I'm a Big Fan
I tried your gummies for the first time today and oh my God they are really the best Candy I have ever had. Only gummies I liked before was the starburst gummies until I tried yours. They stand no chance. Please don't ever stop making them they are amazing.😮. Oh also just bought 84 bucks worth of the sour blue raspberry
Bro ruined Chris😒
His channel is kind of under-rated
Karl is the best mrbeast member
fun fact: if you want the same performance as the last computer: it will only cost 5K which is 20% of the 100K, if he 95K is mostly spent on cosmetics

Queria tanto que os vídeos fossem dublados, estou aprendendo inglês e um dos motivos e ver seus vídeos e lives

Look at me, ima youtuber with lots of money to waste.
Is it just me or does anyone else want Tariq to become a full-fledged member instead of the cameraman?
KARL I LOVE YOU
How dare you insult my computer that cost me a whole $1
Amazing PC, can you imagine how much normal IT equipment you can donate to third world countries with 100k?
Not even a good shader oof. The Nvidia when probably would have been better.

TAREQQQQQQQQQQQQ
lets get nolan his mrbeast gaming pc 😌😌
Mind blown🤯
Türkish dublaj plss Carl fovorite
Funny how nobody notices that at 1:05 you see the debug screen of the "100$ computer" but on the right side of the screen you can clearly see that the cpu in use is a Intel core i7-9750H, which is a laptop cpu (NOT A DESKTOP CPU), and most of the laptops (for example dell or lenovo ones) that come with this cpu have a dedicated gpu like an 1650, a 1660/1660Ti, or more expensive ones a 2060, but he literally uses the integrated graphics, which obviously performance wise does not even compare with one of the above mentioned dedicated gpus. Also he didn't mention anything of optimizing the devices, such as removing bloat, cleaning up the installation, disabling useless services, replacing thermal paste, or maybe TO USE A CAPTURE CARD ON AN EXTERNAL PC and not obs studio which takes a significant amount of resources for low end devices which in other words means it reduces FPS.      Also anybody noticed that he never showed the actual screen of the "100$ computer" 🤔
Quackity??
hooray, new video, Carl is the best 💋
this man is not letting us starve 😭😭
i  dont like karl after knowing he's gay
what the fuck i have a 900 dollar laptop and it takes 20 minutes (literally) to make/open a minecraft world and then it runs at 1 frame per 5 seconds
5000 dollar pc is way better tbh
my laptop worth 225 dollors and i get 2 frames in Minecraft so I don't play it
Yall so lucky u can buy a pc my      I cant even buy one

We love Karl's Mom
Oh my god! That computer is super expensive O_O'
Karl is grinding hard nowadays with  all his  YouTube channel .  Also, let me just say that his recent videos is very entertaining and awesome. I swear!!!
I was waiting to see the pc when i saw the video in the Linus's channel
Idk why some people hate Karl. He's such a good creator!
I love how the tnt says alergic to fire 😂
GOGYYYY
Where's kreek
the 5000$ pc literaly having the same specs as the 100.000$ one what a fake video man
the second pc was a laptop 💀cuz a i7 was a h model which is only on laptop and the xps would prbly have a i7 4770 also that laptop prbly cost about 500 dollars atleast
5:18 thats the closest we will ever get to the Minecraft movie

Don't be upset about your birthday, we all love you like your mom😊
Now give it to me😉

Carl know when they say nasty things to you, for example, you're fat, don't listen to them, they just don't understand your beauty and subscribers love you❤❤❤

Jimmy money?
Yo! the 100k custom made computer is the GOAT! The  graphics are exquisite. The camera of the PC is so top notch. Karl and George looks so flawless. Now we all know that Karl Jacobs is one of the richest content creator out there  for spending 100K for 8 min content . Amazing videos Karl. Seriously your video is getting awesome now! Good job! Also, your Pixel playground is awesome too.
Future gummie
Gogy is sounding mad American now..
Please, I'm a Big Fan, Can You Give me a Gaming PC, I'm very like to play games & stream it, please.....!😥💔
0:08 Bruh I play on that

I’m trying to buy a gaming motherboard. Wanna play high graphics games. Wondering 2000$ ok?
I love the videos you guys make! But I just don't get the ending: 8:22
"Karl effect, chandlers the last real one left"

That Wallpaper on $100,000 worth's more than the PC 💀
Karl, you are very cute!  do not pay attention to insults, you are the best and most beautiful! ❤💜💕
I love you
I like turtles
They have just built you a pc worth really more than 100000$, have spent nearly a year on it just so you do this stupid video on it??? Really?? Talk about a waste of time!

my pc is stronger than the $100k one kmao
GOGGY
Still waiting for the Tales From The SMP

Karl effect
Wow, couldn't have given much more of a thank you to LTT? Was this just for one video, and now it's gonna sit in a closet somewhere? LTT spent months designing and producing this piece of art and it was extremely well refined. Such a shame.
Gay
Your pink hair ruined Chris!
KARL IS ACTIVE RN??OMG
Karl’s Neck Must Have Hurt So Much Looking At That Movie Theatre Screen
my fps is only 61 fps and my computer didnt broke

*Whoever reading this. Don't give up. Hustle everyday.*
Bro went “blahahaha” 💀
A
Karl's been spending too much time with MrBeast
9 fps is high
The dude went from 100 to 5000 like i got one for 2$
That one tiktoker putting 10m tnt and didn't drop a single frame🗿🗿       (Edit: im trying to find him now)
If the PC Karl is playing on worth $5000, then how much monstrous MrBeast PC is worth? 🤔
Nolan is a better villain than Karl (Changed my mind) 😂
Ngl my pc is worse then the $100 pc 😂😂😂
Colby have a cancer whats ur reaction karl
Outro >> Whole Video
How would the 100 k computer go against a repeating command block that spawned an entity. Like xp, or wardens
Awww gogys wave, but ty for being so active
Hi can I have Robux. I want to surpise my brother for his birthday. Goal 5k. Username: KEVYROBOT

Omg

….That moment I thought the $100 was amazing………all because a lot of computers mysteriously get slower and slower even if you dont change anything on them
I love how consistently ur posting ❤ it's giving my new fav YouTuber
How much money do you make every month on youtube on this channel
interestingly when Karl started to set off more explosions vs the 100k computer, my internet crapped out and froze and I briefly thought my own computer had somehow crashed even though that's not how anything works and I know it lmao.
You called my pc trash Karl
0:35  Yo stop, why does George sound so American😂
KNF =)))
Tareq is so funny

POV:  EvanMCGaming is here
I’m loving the new videos. These are hilarious.
Words cannot describe the joy when Carl releases a video
When everyone is talking bout Karl but George was funny too lol. (Karl is great ngl)
The effort put into this video is amazing
I wish i had a pc loved the video tho!!
Español por favor!!!!!

KEEP GOING KARL!
Hi karl
what did you do to chris? GIve us the chris we know back!
Carl, you should use this exact video but instead of with computers, do it with mouses
Put Mrbeast and Chandler in your next video
Hi Karl
The upload schedule is an upload schedule
i kina like Karl hes cute and funny tho😢
literally everyone in the comments: *CAN WE PLEASE APPRECIATE HOW KARL IS FINALLY UPLOADING!!🎉*
Respect for Karl he sure spent a lot of money for this video
Thank Karl for happiness❤
this is crazy
Dear Karl and George, as zWromZ tested normal minecraft (no sahder or texure pack) as same specs, it was like 1000 FPS at 4K Resolution
“Nolan did you ever get a computer to explode?” “Well yours is gonna explode!” “I at least have one to explode….”  The disrespect is wild  💀 💀💀
I love your videos so much and how funny they are
less go
cant believe you spent 100k on this one of a kind pc custom built by linus tech tips.. and this is the video you make from it??? it  makes me so depressed i actually feel sick.. ugh
Кто у нас Русские?
RIP Frank😭
thank u karl for uploading. i knew i could count on u for gaming content when beast gaming isn't uploading as much ❤️
How can i get the last computer i want to buy it
I saw the Linus video on this first. Sad it was used only for the video. Is it going to be your setup for the gaming channel? What are you doing with it. I think you should give it to someone who can’t afford a gaming setup
Its a shame that after a certain point its software holding it back rather than hardware
Frank is in good place now
Awesome
Hi Karl 👋😊
Scared that karl will turn into mr bro but gaming...... I love karl but hes doing the exact same style as mr beast. To be fair though mr beast doesnt upload nearly as much on his gaming channel, and karl is better at being infront of a camera compared to mr bro.
Hm, I guess tnt IS allergic to fire.
ate
😊😅😮❤🎉
RIP MINECRAFT Villager 1 sec - 2 sec
Good thing we have Karl to hold us over while we're waiting for Mr. Beast to upload.
my pc would've been already gone
KARL🥰
OMGG I LOVE UR VIDEOS SO MUCH!!!
MORE OF KARL PLS

Bro the $100,000 computer's quality is just mind+boggling🤯🤯🤯🤯

Carl never disappoints us❤❤❤
Yo Karl do you like kreek?
The $100 computer is better then mine
i only have a 75$ trashy pc
His laugh
4 hours ago and 109 thousand views?! This is proof you are awesome
Loving the regular Karl uploads
Bro that slow mo video of the tnt explosions was so good
I forgot you exist
Karl: “When I was back in high school!” George: “so 20 years ago!!!” Karl: “shut up._.” George you’re literally older than Karl💀
Ey LTT computer
Karl’s never gets boring to watch
Can I have that LTT PC Karl? :P

Karl never fails to entertain us
We all know that Karl is amazing
Bir türk olarak tek yapabildiğim videoyu beğenip geçmek🥲

LTT really outdid themselves with the desk PC. That thing looks beautiful!
RIP FRANK 2023😭😭😭

Came from LTT to see how the $100,000.00 PC is being put to use. Was not disappointed 😌
W Karl video
1:47 what if MrBeastGaming just doesn't upload anymore even though the computers didn't crash. 😅😅😅 Let Karl take over the Minecraft content!
Minecraft has got to stop being the standard for reaching maximum fps, challenging the pc for God's sake
Karl looks like Mathew beam
Can we appreciate how active karl is these days n george is there too HIII GOGGGYYYYY :)
George looks so good in this video 🫶🏻💘
Yo gay ?
can you please solution Arabic pleese😭
First 42:00
Hey Karl, that is one super dooper deluxe pc desk that Linus and his sidekicks built for you! I know that you will enjoy it for a long time.😊
ah yes who knew that tnt was allerigc to fire. lol
الله يهديكم يا قوم لوط الملعون لم و لن تتعلموا من الذين قبلكم  ادعوا الله ان ينزل عليكم عذاب اكثر من الذين قبلكم
And I'm also from Ukraine) I don't know English well, so the translation may not be clear to you. I hope you will respond to my comment. (Wrote by Andrii) :) I wish you luck:) see you soon;)
My computer can’t even run Minecraft and I’m a 3d designer and I use blender so a simple render takes days, I genuinely can’t comprehend how it’s so bad rendering a single cure with one light took about 3 and a half hours, I can afford a slightly better computer but want to save up the money for college even though it’s not that much
Yeah Karl! You still rock!!
PAWFECT 7:45 😂😂😂😂😂
Hi Karl, I'm your fan, I saw you in Mr. Beast team and I started watching Mr. Beast because of you and I saw a video on tik tok where you are being insulted on the stream, if that's the case, I feel sorry for you.
goes from 100 to 5000 dollars why
KARL, I LOVE YOU ❤
I have a slight suspicion he may have taken a pinch of inspiration from mr beast
7:20 this music sounds familiar
5:54 at this point i feel like he's using a mod
The Nolan face better be at the end of EVERY video EVERY time
😮wow 2 hours ago
KARLLLLL!!!!! YAYYYY!!!! ANOTHER KARL VIDEO!!!!
wtf... man gets a 100k computer and literally films it with blurry ass shitty effect filled video... AND THEN PROCEEDS TO STRESS TEST IT IN SURVIVAL, DYING BEFORE IT CAN EVEN BEGIN TO DROP FRAMES... What the fuck is wrong with you?
The $100 PC is honestly pretty good for the price, with a graphics card and another 8gb ram, it'd be a great budget system!
Yesss Karl uploaded again and i am watching it at 1 am
Giv me a comupter dat is 1,00000 dolar
This is bad. And the computer didn't break. The screen won't break. It's bad. Check the numbers of the last videos and this style works for him with views but it's bad and it's false advertising aka click bait. Nice that the crew will help but this is bad. I left the video early. My bad for subscribing but this is bad and pretty lame. Grown men making kids videos and lying to the audience. Terrible
ahhh it’s so fun when Karl and George are together :D
The videos are Always funny
George is so cute
Yay George is in here
Урааа новое видео!!
Karl is the new mr beast :3
Karl is Goated
I was impressed with the $100 computer

OMG I saw that $100,000 a lot of time ago in linus tech tips, and now you upload the video?!?!?!  You are so slow, hurry it up Mr. Snail 🐌

I still can't get over george and karl irl content
Karl uploads hit different
Clair de Lune as Frank met his unfortunate end was a nice touch.
I have a laptop for gaming worth 1500$ and it survived 1000s of tnt  I don’t know the exact number but it survived 1000s or 10000s of tnt but I know 500,000 can crash it if I’m right next to it
karl is the best please make karl in russian 😢💗я буду очень рада ... Люблю его 😢❤
Oh my gosh 😮😮 that’s so cool 😊❤
hellooo karl eu sou do BR
HI
Karl is more consistent than Mr beast.
I’m literally so happy that Karl’s been posting so much recently!! Karl content = best content
I met Linus Tech Tips at a Micro Center in California
I was doing math with my mother but, seeing that Karl uploaded once again made me wanna do the math quicker so I could watch the video XD
