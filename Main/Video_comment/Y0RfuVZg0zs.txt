Brendan looked at not getting paid for six months and couldn't stand it! He has to get paid. It is who he is. Loves it.
Anyone know where I can buy that top he's wearing?
What would be: a good/success-FULL:  Season/Year; for you: -Celtic, Fan's/supporter's?? -M.K.S. -P.S. Say, for: this coming_season; of course?? (And/or; for:  The Next; 5-10: years)??
He's obviously forgotten the loving supporters that screwed his hoose and terrified his wife, he'll be gone next year to Saudi.
True glad John Kennedy, stayed put to existing times ahead all to see👀roll on season 23/24🍀👏👏
can't believe brenda is back in town. gonna miss big ange
he'll be off once the first job offer comes in from England or Europe.....
Just be competitive in Europe..not get gubbed 7-1 and 5-0..always difficult in a league where only rangers can challenge..in the eighties we had Celtic rangers Aberdeen and Dundee utd all challenging for trophies.
kudos to the board in getting this guy back, literally the best man for the job
Brenda is back 💩
Best that was going but sorry if he told me tomorrow was Sunday I’d phone danny mcgrain
He too the easy option. Sad. Scottish and Welsh football should fully merge i to the EFL. Just change the name of it. It would be best for all concerned and bring Scottish and Welsh football to a higher level. Just get over the idiotic nationalism.
At least the Green Brigade aren’t hypocrites!
Pure scum the way he left but glad he has scurried back after getting sacked, if he loses that first old firm it is game over he better get it right
No doubt the green brigade will make an arse of themselves in his first game 😂
This guy is using Celtic as a stepping stone yet again
Always loved Celtic , proud and honoured to be grabbing the dosh.. Will definitely jump ship when another premiership club comes knocking
I was surprised when Ange got the big job at Tottenham Hotspurs mainly  due to his poor record in Europe and equally so when Rodgers decided to return to Celtic but fair play to Dermot Desmond and his powers of persuasion in getting a top class man for the Celtiic job - easily the best of the candidates being touted.
Next Spurs boss.
Welcome Back Brendan☘🇮🇪
Wee all hate how he left but he pushed the club in the direction that was needed from the pitch to champions league football so for that big respect nb or not accepting what wee don’t want we want more at Celtic not settling for wining the league every year and just tsking mine from the champions legato stead of taking part you have my support mate 👌🏻🇮🇪👍🍀
Brendan would move in the middle of pre-season if a big team comes in for him
As a Chelsea fan and a Scot, I think this is a wonderful appointment, we’ll done Celtic you are an amazing club and great ambassadors for Scotland! Vietnam loves you 🍀⚽️🍀⚽️🍀
Beale's wee mole will be twitching uncontrollably as he ponders the year ahead !
Absolutely delighted to have a genuinely top drawer manager back where he belongs, welcome home Brendan 🍀🥳🏆
If Spurs had come in or another decent premier league club then he wouldn't have gone back.He hasnt done it for the love of Celtic theyve nowt to beat apart fom one other every season.
We love ya bredan enjoy it
My fear's: (say); for: Celtic_ "Under:_ "B.R." (Brendan_Rodgers)": It could be [Heaven: Forbid]; -like:  Neil_Lennon (going back): His time, @ L.C.F.C., end-ed: so poor-ly??   -[Near to:  "The [very]_Relegation;_ places!?"!!]??  (And they end-ed -up: get-ting; Relegated: of -course). Some (of the many??): People; say, that: his -signing's, can be poor **and he is more: -defensive**   and finally??  =  "the rankers": were: a poor-er:  side/team; back then!!  Will the competition; be better/have: "the rankers":  caught -up/Improved; a lot/so much!!??
Winning games 🎉Winning trophies fair n Square he's capable 2 achieve 🍀💚🇨🇮🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
chocolate biscuit is back at the tattie bowl
Try & fit a trip to Swansea before your preseason Brendan 🙏 it’s magic having the Bhoys  here
Did nothing in Europe nothing and that's our money maker
Brendan is Celtic manager now for the same reason he was manager in the first place. Nobody wants him in the Premier League. That's the reality unfortunately. As soon as a club from down south come in, the snake 🐍 will be gone again.
Sorry I can't support a manager that souled his soul to the devil
He’s welcome back with the Jacks anytime 🥇⚽️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿💯
The best possible outcome.  Maybe this is a good opportunity to get rid of the pyro boys.
fake...before he managed Celtic first time round he was a multi millionaire. he left Celtic in the shit potentially missing 10 in a row because of greed....he should never be aloud back in the stadium...
Citi Group here we come...whether we like it or not. Our trad emerald green is slowly becoming sea-green and then it will be sky blue. The name change will be next. Welcome to Celtic City!
Probably the best appointment we could have made in terms of experience. Just don't expect any loyalty from him! Not only did he  leave the club at a vital time, he basically took the backroom staff too. That said, the days of loyalty from coaches, players and managers are a rarity, unfortunately. As long as he does what he is payed to do, that's all we can ask for. Our club is bigger than any individual. HH.
Speaks like a champion 🍀 great to have have him
Keep them in there box and improve in Europe and it will be a job well done.
Mibee Brendan can do sumhing about these fckn boring black away kits , thur was ah reason refs used tae wear black kits
Very proud of him.
🍀💚🍀💚When can I buy this top he's wearing ??
He's a mercenary, but a top quality manager. He's still a rat though
He’s back, let’s support him & the Team 🙌🍀⚪️🟢⚽️
He came back to do something in Europe, aw my fucking side
Why wasn't he asked how he felt about the Celtic fans making up a song for him and his family to be shot when he left last time
A don't believe a word he says, he's clearly uncomfortable in this interview n after watching Callum McGregor's interview a don't think he believes this is the right man for the job either
👏👏👏👏
So this is how it feels to be Celtic, Brenda is a rat. He's happy loads of money but I 🐁 Rodgers can go to the barras for all care HH
No be as easy this time
welcome again ,great manager and a brilliant ambassador for CELTIC.... CMON THE BHOYS.😅
🐀
past is the past onto next season lest defend this treble👊
Same old pish
Well a have mixed emotions,a don't think  this guy wants to be here,it's where else could he have went,a don't care what he does but  keep Kyogo,sell him it's short term gains with no substance,we'll lose him,then I have had it,a  ain't even bothering to check the results
Welcome back big man
Time to get behind Brendan and the Team 🍀🍀🍀
Let's go big man..the past stays in the past. Right behind you 🍀🍀🍀
Brendan will have us overtake the buns 55 titles and their tears will taste sweet when we do
Very proud to be here again
Good luck mate glad to have you back now let's get together and behind this man as one family and keep these clowns in there place hail hail
James Forrest “ how’s currently still here” ???
We forgive you gaffer
Complete lying rat but let's get behind him🎉🎉
You are guaranteed the 3 T's  with Rodgers, Tan Teeth and Trebles
Welcome home Brendan. Onward and upwards 🏆🏆🏆🍀🍀🍀
Have great confidence in Brendan
In hoops bar tenerife  were all buzing
He should not be back.
Please bring Tierney home. He was different levels working with Rodger's 🤞
If the ranjers can say they’re the same club then we can say Brendan never left..welcome back Gaffer let’s get to work☘️HH🟩⬜️🟧
We're all behind you again Brendan.🍀🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿☘️🇮🇪
Welcome back Brendon 💚🍀 hail hail
Welcome home brendan 💚🍀
Welcome back # Brendan hail hail
Its just a business now, we shouldn't get so attached to managers. Banging the chest just doesn't do it anymore. Come in, do the job and then celebrate but don't lead the fans on. Good to see that the backroom team have stuck together.
Would have been happy to never have seen his face again after what he done, but just seeing the actual balls on him to comeback after the abuse he took, then I'll certainly back him, he's here now! And he has a massive bit of making up to do but we've got to all back him ! Ange wasn't any better was he? First chance he got he was out the door!
Ange left the club is a very good spot
I’m ready to get hurt again fkn buzzing he’s back! I’m more excited for this season now he’s back home 🍀
He will do a great job ….. until a premier league club comes in for him
In time I will forgive but I will never FORGET
Welcome home boss ☘☘☘
Absolutely bloody over the moon!!!
Welcome back big man.
Please get us a Goalkeeper Brendan.......
Welcome back home it's going to be amazing 👏 let's go to work 💪 🙌 😊
he signed for 3 easy years v no doubt 4 plus managers bring on the next treble brendan🎉
World Exclusive WTF This interviewer talks as if Scotland is a World Power . It’s the arshole of Europe
🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮
Chuffed he is back and if you are against him for the past then fine but celtic fans are meant to be faithful through and through
😒He's just not Ange.  Can we do it... Instead of... We can do it
How pissed is he that the Bournmouth gig was 2 days after he signed,?   Honestly?
As long as he maintains success and recruits well that’s all that matters 🍀
A fantastic appointment for Celtic plays the game the correct way fine attacking football on the floor he’s made for Celtic and I’m a Rangers fan good luck Brendan 👍
I feel no one is remembering the feeling of betrayal when he fuckin dumped the team mid season. "I'm so happy to be allowed back"  Big cheque, white teeth, fuckin rat!
LFG
Perfect first interview
Good shout for forest tae ❤👌🍀🇮🇪
Never a stepping stone 😉 welcome back 🍀🇮🇪🏆
To go back to the club you love after the bad timing 8:57 he left takes a lot of guts. Anybody  else would never go near paradise again. Balls of steel. Get behind him, he will do us proud. A half-thinking Brendan will pile more misery on that load of dung up the road. Coybig.
It's a no from me.
Like most I didn't like how he left, but let's not forget some of the player signings that came through the door. Players that it appeared he did not have any say if they were coming in. The board Lawell seemed to be bringing those players in. In some aspects the board did back him Edward is the most expensive player we've ever bought. This time the board should be congratulationed on BR coming back. As the new Celtic Manager he will have my full support and hopefully he does well in Europe and brings in some quality players and plays entertaining football. He has a chance to move us to another level and as a celtic fan that's all I want MONTHEHOOPS
Take the crap with you  what you signed for Leicester should do well in Scotland 😂😂😂
Best man for the job. Our family are so pleased you are in charge again. HH.
Welcome back Brendan🍀🍀🍀🍀
He heard us calling in the night 😆🍀🏆🏆🏆
I love how he didn't even mention anything negative whatsoever. Here to win. That'll do for me 🍀
Welcome back 🍀💚
Very proud of my £3m a year. So cringe!
Lets get goin Brendan, intae them ! 👍🍀
Only man fit to manage our club
I love this man
I can forgive the way he left before, but will never forget....  the positives from his last spell far outweigh that for me, invincible treble that was a catalyst for a quadruple, pumped sevco so hard they banned our fans from their stadium......this is the first time I feel our board has shown proper ambition beyond being better than the other side playing in Glasgow.....if it took him to leave, to finally get the board to get their act together & show some proper ambition & backing....to entice him back? Then I'm happy with the situation as it is, welcome back Brendan, think this is gonna be an exciting season
🐍🐍🐍🐍
You're the man, Brendan. Welcome back ! The Celtic fans are right behind you.
I can’t see Celtics dominance up in Scotland changing anytime soon not only are they the biggest club up there but they have the best Management Team.
💚
We all make mistakes in life. Welcome home, Brendan
Hi Brendan from south Africa .the way u left was very hard Gutted But it's great to see u back cannot wait for champions league .I cannot get the gers out my head they didn't see this one coming after ange .we need to thank the board making sure we stay on top making sure all the fans in Glasgow and around the world are all happy bhoys .so Brendan let's go show our club around the world let other clubs come see our fans at celtic Park and off course first game at ibrox cannot wait for that one .go there and let the blue side of Glasgow see Brendan is back in town hail hail
Failed at Leicester and will fail this time around at Celtic.. Rangers Dominate this year after last old firm game
My daughter and he pals will be at the game in Seoul
Bottom line is, if Jock Stein had been the manager of Celtic in the modern game and a massive english premiership team came in for him, he'd be off to. Its the promise land of football for every professional. Not to mention the astronomical money they are on down there to
World exclusive ahahahahaha
Welcome home Brendan 🍀
Embarrassing Morth Korean interviewer. Vacant questions. Softball & moronic. CFC PRAVDA stuff.
This is surreal
Boa Noite a todos os guerreiros e guerreiras do celtic fc.
Onwards and Upwards!!
Fantastic delving into the psyche of a Elite Level manager one thing I picked up is Brendan's wants to throw punches at a European Level  ok he is realistic and isn't saying we will win the CL but he definitely has ambitions for the Europa League  should we end up there and I seen a glint in his eye when he spoke  clearly hoping for the best but focused on the task at hand if Celtic could reach the last 16 of the CL that would be a monumental achievement  for a club constrained by the finical gulf we will be facing but to drop into the Europa League and win it is a tantalising thought  both him and us as fans are under no illusions what we are facing  I for one hope BR sees the 80 chances we created as a squad in the CL and puts the clubs money where it matters most on a pedigree Striker  who will be feared at European Level and can retain the Gems in our squad and further polish those diamonds .  HH
So fucking excited about next year now. Wasn't happy when Ange left but this is the best result we could get I think. Well done Mr Desmond 👏🍀💚
Soon as Leicester got relegated he jumped ship 😅
The most successful manager since Jock Stein. If Celtic had backed him the first time around things could have been different.
I still feel like I'm tripping or having a very vivid dream . Surreal as 😂😂😂 Wasn't happy. Fully backing him & I'm dying for the season to start COYBIG 🍀💚☘
Brendan is admired by many other club supporters. Good man.
Let’s get tae work …. HH
Who wee fancy as new keeper?  thats a must for the big nights build from the back on our weekness,.a big of height threw the team 3 or 4 big lads and wee will be a hard team to beat. Plus theres a few gems that big ange will put him on to lets be honest probs the first call to eachother as both know the answers on both sides of the stick will a stay or will a go will a come back ect 😅
Pretty much how I thought it would go, I’m happy with the boss, I think he will surprise a few folk now he’s got the boards backing and also, are we not about forgiveness? We all make mistakes and I always respect anyone who at least tries to rectify it, really looking forward to this season, mon the hoops! 🍀🍀👍
Let's hope the GB don't hang any cringey banners having a go at Brendan. We need to stay united. Friction between manager and fans doesn't help the players on the pitch. Welcone back Brendan! HH
Amazing to have Brendan back
Obviously as a Celtic fan I wish Brendan Rodgers all the best at Celtic & in his life in general. He's a decent human being &deserves respect. Welcome back to Scottish 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿⚽️ football Brendan 👍🍀
Got to achieve something in Europe with this man… Mon the hoops!
Magic stuff 🍀🇮🇪
World exclusive. He’s the manager of YOUR club🤣🤣🤣
Good luck and enjoy the experience.  Great to see you back!
He didn't have to come back, he could have stayed away, might have been the easier option but he wanted to return to celtic, people will always hold the past against him, but hes a damn good coach, so i hope we all can back him and the team and try get more success.
The huns are shitten bricks😂😂😂
The Blue Swamp has been strangely quiet 🤫...That can only mean one thing .... They're 💩it 🤣😂🤣
We have been hurt before and again! But he is without sin cast the first stone! We have all fallen short as a Scott a celt and greatness!" By the temptations of silver and gold! Let the huddle the brigade and the celtic greats welcome this man back and remember what we stand for as a culture a religion a nation hail hail fucking hail more than a club x
Very excited by Brendan Rodgers return!
How many of these people here commenting on this work for the club? Or are you just forgetful about what this man done. Oh I'm a celtic man blah blah blah.....and then leaves just over half way through a season for a mediocre and dismal small club like Leicester. There were also alot of discontent with Brendan has his clear lack of say at times in signings. Complaining about how many wingers we have....poor loan signings being made near the end of his tenure. And in this interview they ask him about HIS new signing. He didn't sign him! What a dismal interview where he should have been asked out right about his manner of leaving but of course, the usual hierarchy celtic line has been walked.
Brendan the Fraud, it’s always all about him.  Can’t be trusted that man.
If he never managed Liverpool, I'd fully suppport him lol. He's a great manager and he left in bad circumstances but he can right that wrong now. Good luck to him
I have a great feeling about this, euro success is on the cards
Embarrassing taking him back he walked during the night
Pinnochio the liar .
Let's Get To Work 🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💚🫶💪
WOW!! Now it feels real !!
The notoriously stupid Celtc fans will believe anything.  🤣🤣🤣  Not one EPL club would touch Rodgers with a bargepole.  Box Office Brendan just relegated Leicester.
He could’ve said no…he didn’t. Get behind this man:
I still can't believe he's back. What a signing best guy for the job. And regardless how he left he's still a Bhoy .HH
The prodigal son returns
He left He came back what's the problem.  Let's get to work. HH
I believe he can do great things with Celtic but I hope to christ he doesn't do the dirty on us again fuckin no way jose. HAIL HAIL
Best of luck, Brendan. Here's to continue winning leagues & cups domestically, but possibly even more important: Let's finally start to rebuild our strength on the European stage. cheers, P. in Japan, (ex-Scotland)
I need that kit man is that a new training kit or something it looks quality
Happy with that 👍👍🍀🍀
Welcome back to the Celtic family
We go again
He's always been articulate and speaks brilliantly. His compliments of Ange are a good thing, I'll always remember how Deila got off on the wrong foot questioning the fitness of Lennons side. I don't expect trebles every year but with this guy at the helm, I'm pretty sure we can retain our league title for a few years yet and maybe have a wee run in Europe too. I'd like him to use the depth of squad the way Ange did. Lots of changes, lots of freshness. We are financially superior to our domestic rivals and in the winter breaks, we can ensure we stay ahead with clever recruitment.
Glad tae see him home 💚🍀
Leicester was experience to help him manage a much bigger club even better than he did before. Welcome home Brendan. There may have been some anger at your departure but losing a massive part of you is always a sore one. Don’t take it personally. Anyway, look forward to all the success you will bring to Celtic
The league and a good run in Europe that's all I ask for .
Buzzing 😎🍀
Be good if he said Sorry 😢
A hear Brendan saying the brand when talking about going to Japan , isn’t it about time we went back to our roots and repay the incredible loyalty of Celtic fans in Ireland by having pre season in Derry , Belfast , Dublin , it might not be box office for some Celtic fans more interested in banking even more money , but sometimes repaying loyalty can go a long way 🇮🇪🇮🇪☘️☘️
Genuinely excited to see Brendan back!
All the best Brendan HH🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
It's as if he never left! Delighted with his appointment. Ange who???!!
No one was happy you left but we're delighted you're back. 💪 Welcome home Rodge ✔
Welcome Back Brendan HH 🍀
I was gutted when brendan left but understood it the epl riches are just to hard to turn down,I'm now really excited to see what he can do with our team I think it will work out great hail hail.
Agent ange will be back next year and he'll bring Son with him after buying James mcarthy for a record $80 million fee. Hard to lose our prized playmaker but I think 80 million is fair
Welcome home BR
Rendan bodgers very first time at the club he supported as a boy ☘️🇮🇪🤗
3 in a row here we go! 🥰
Brilliant.    Really want us to carry on improving and we defo should under out Man.  BR, welcome home.   HH 🍀💚🍀💚🍀
Overjoyed to have him back and the sevco mob will be absolutely hating it. Lets crack on and defend our 8th treble and go for 9🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Weak Celtic, a man who disrespected your club and you take him back 😅😅😅
Amazing to see him back....Be proud Brendan...we are !!!
I'm very proud to have Brendan back, he's a beautiful human being
With the foundations ange has put down, surely we should kick on in Europe this season. More experience in the squad at that level and arguably a better man manager. Either way buzzing for the season 🍀 hail hail
Canny believe brendan is back. Yassssssss
Brenda's back and celtic dominance will continue
Brilliant to have him back, can we replace gerry though? Does ma head in
He’s got a lot to make back up, another treble would help 🎉
"Well I'm very proud" I thought he stopped saying that since Darren Farley ripped into him 🤣😂
Welcome back Brendan that training top is a beauty 🍀🍀🇮🇪🇮🇪🟢⚪️🟠
Lucky to have him. Welcome back Brennan, time to dominate once again HH 🍀
lucky boy getting a 2nd chance!
Aaaa fucking love br...... dynamite let's get to work
We're in a good spot, more glory to come bhoys 🍀
Will be interesting to see how the players react to him on the pitch, first game of the season could be a statement🍀. Need to keep our good players increase their transfer valuation abit and introduce some raw talent, Celtic FC has probably never been in a better position three in a row incoming 🍀💚
Glad to have him back. Onwards and upwards
Gutted when he left. Buzzing he’s back.
Celtic fans should be blessed to have this man back at the helm, he is a brilliant manager who was thrown under the bus at Leicester in his last season there. All the teams around him bought players & upgraded whilst Leicester refused to give him the tools as they were in financial disarray.
I can’t lie I’m still struggling. I think he walk away again but…. It’s my club and hopefully he helps us overtake the other lots 55! That means they’ll have nothing on us then!
Sevco fans  😢😢😢😢😢
It’s like we’ve taken back that hot girlfriend after she’s banged half the town. Now they’ve had their way with her, we’ve taken her back.
Let’s get to work,Hail hail 🍀
Team behind the team has been totally revamped since he left under a cloud. This time will be much better & we're off to a flier with Odin. Very excited!
Damn my hearts in my mouth 💚😮 never mind uncle Brendan the 1 fan watching here is all over the place HH
Brilliant welcome home brenden 🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮 HAIL HAIL
He's already forgotten about Tony Ralston

👍🏾
Liverpool fan here but I love Celtic too.. Really hope Brendan is still hungry for success, hope he batters them Sevco neighbours. 😊 Mon the Hoops, YNWA
It's good to see the green brigade sticking to their GUNS..the same guns Yous wanted to shoot him with..hahaha.Yous are still a JOKE..love it..keep it coming please..hahaha..salty tears taste so nice..hahaha.watp.
Left under a cloud , came back in the sunshine, let's get behind Brendan and the treble train will keep on rolling 🍀💚🏆🏆🏆
Let’s be honest he could of held off n waited a few n been first choice for most premier league clubs. So he’s back by choice n he’s here to win! Let’s go big man 🟢⚪️
HH Rodgers let’s get to work 👌💚
Poor ange man😂 imagine ko your delighted to have rodgers back when deep down yous all love ange and still wish he was celtic manager!😂 bloody ko your happy. Fake fans. What a laugh. Singing about a rat and being fake. Cany wait to batter his team from last time rangers where weak n shite. Bring it on Brenda
Courtesy of Pete Townshend;  "Yeah Meet the new boss Same as the old boss" ;  A chest thumping,  badge kissing spoofer, "one of our own"! Until a "bigger" club like Leicester/Spurs comes along!  I think alot more of Celtic Football Club than this fawning nonsense of welcome back!  Our Celtic, that entity of the Heat of Lisbon, or the cold of ibrox,  as raith win on penalties.  The Celtic of our families, through generations, investing hard earned money into Our Club, while at the same time the transient badge kissers take millions per year, out!  The Celtic of a real "One of Our Own" Tommy Burns, a decent man, as he tried, with 2 arms tied behind his back, to stop a proven rotten club win 9 in a row.  Celtic deserves better than a Rodgers or a Postecoglu. They won trebles with our sole competitor in a post receivership heap.  Jock Stein and MON did it against better Hun teams and got to European finals. Tommy Burns 95 Cup win far outweighs any treble since 2016. Wim Jansen stopped a 10.   Rodgers turned his back on one.  Won't get fooled again!  Forever HAIL! HAIL! by the way!
sign excellent players asap please 😁
He's back to make things right !!!! Welcome back boss💚🍀💚🍀💚💪🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Just give him the benefit of the doubt and get behind him
Bredan Rodgers is here for Taylor and Oh....
Welcome to our new / old manager as long as he does the business for the club and supporters thats good enough for me regardless how he left before he's here now and thats all that matters.  Hail hail 🍀🍀
Anje who
He’s back, he’s made a choice to come bck …  On wards   Hail hail   King hunskelper
He's a bum of f%ck but he's a great coach, we now know more than ever not to get to bothered with loyalty. Just win in style and that'll do  let's get to work.
Love Brendan 👍 a legend and loves the club!!!
No point in holding a grudge, get behind the manager.
Let’s  fk the hun😅🇨🇮
brendan
Let's do it
Welcome home Brendon hail hail 💚🍀💚🍀👍
Fraud of a manager who can only win in a Mickey Mouse league.
Will Danny McGrain remain part of the coaching team?
Best possible appointment. Very happy Brendan is back.
The future is looking Rosey,I am glad to see and hear Brendan... Welcome back to Paradise
Buzzing.
I’ll give him a break but I won’t forget
League winning T-shirts at the end of the season will read "Job Done"
His European vision 🤣🤣🤣🤣 The best he has done is the last 16 of the europa league ffs broxi bear has went further in europe 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Trading a traitor for a relegated traitor 🤣🤣🤣🤣Better get better security this time brenda and dont tell selik fans were you stay this time brenda look what happened the last when celtic fans broke into your house and terrorised your wife and kids . I wonder if the gangrene brigade will still  call him a fraud and and a traitor 🤣🤣 Will selik fans still sing there brenda rogers song 🎵 i hope you die in your with a bullet from the ira ?  Taking brenda back is like getting hurt and humiliated by your ex then paying her every week for humilating you 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Enjoyable Q&A.  Best of luck to a proven winner whose teams I've always enjoyed watching and if his success continues as before at Celtic, it'll be a great time. HH
HAIL HAIL BRENDAN
Welcome Home Brendan ❤☘️
Best of luck Brendan, just don't walk halfway through a season again please,i,ll back you like most Celts 100%,HAIL HAIL
Happy to be here my arse
I honestly see someone who is fecking itching and time ain't passing quick enough for him to get stuck right in 🍀 we are in for a treat 🍀 COYBIG. Welcome back Brendan.
Be hilarious if he left halfway through the season to be a scout for albion rovers
It shows the love the man has for Celtic. His affiliation with Celtic brought him back. Could’ve got the money and more anywhere in the world. It really hurt when he left and stung for a good couple years but I’m more than delighted he is back. Welcome home
Welcome back Brendan, I’m glad you answered the call. Let’s do this! 🍀
Played selik like a banjo! Walks back in on 3 million quid! No one else wanted him...just got the richest team ever relegated! 😃😃😃😃
The past is the past let's get behind Brendan. Don't give these Huns a sniff of hope by being divided. Hail hail 🇮🇪🇮🇪
Hh
Leicester over Celtic never seemed a gud move! But he did win a FA Cup didn't he!?? Very few Managers win an FA Cup, its historic any way u look at it.🤔
only now, having seen this interview does it actually feel real, the man is back! let's get to work.
Feels to be Celtic..hahaha..the guy ran away as fast as he could..hahaha.Yous wanted to put a bullet in him..hahaha.the banners were out..hahaha.done nothing for Yous in Europe..hahaha.got sacked...got his last team relegated..hahaha.laughing stock..hahaha.that's how it feels to be Celtic.hahaha.watp
Happy to see roders back in
Big mistake, never go back in Life!  Another example of Brendan grandiose ego! He can only fail to live up to his first stint.😂
Brendan left to do another 4 years in a top league so that he would come back as a much better manager, all part of the long term plan
His eyes are further apart than the board and the fans
He's a better coach than Ange. With these players we could be in for a special season. I can feel it in the air.
YOU  are a very lucky man Brendan  !  Get to work 💪
Hi
Keep It down, know wot I mean, COYBIG, HH.
Cannot wait for next season HH 🍀🍀
Great to hear him say the first time success is in the past, and he’s ready to win trophies now 🍀🍀🍀
Welcome back Brendan. We were devastated to lose you but just as delighted you have returned. The Prodigal Son. Let's get to work
Welcome home
Smart appointment Rodgers will do well
Welcome home Brendan 💚🍀
Who in life has never made a mistake? Yeah we've all  made mistakes in life and no one really knows what happened last time round when he departed for the EPL, lets be greater than the haters and get behind the team and the manager and drive them onto more success HH up the MIGHTY CELTIC GLASGOW ✊🍀💚✊
All for the team, don't get brain washed that our new signing was made by BR come on now! It's actually BR part 4 cus he left just before the third treble and any previous signings are not welcome back as is him. 🌟🏆🏆🏆
You need to think about what made him decide to take the job back, I look at it as, he wants to right a wrong, you don't get many chances to do that in life, so to the green brigade, get behind this ....
Welcome home BR 💚
Damn. I should of taken a walk up earlier
As soon as Man Utd come in I'll be off like a shot.
I believe him ❤
9th treble inbound
Welcome back Brendan HH
Here we go 🍀 absolutely buzzin for the new season now 🍀
Once a 🐀 always a 🐀 he won't change will frig off back to the overrated league first sniff of a job unlike ange
For us to appoint a manager who won almost 3 trebles with Celtic in under 2 weeks of another manager leaving is great work by the club, real show of intent and I’m looking forward to kicking off with Brendan at the helm again
Welcome back gaffer I can't wait 🍀
welcome back brendan onwards and upwards hail hail
Ange leaving was the best thing that happened to Celtic this Summer .Brendan returning was written in the stars. I can feel it in me water!!
Still can’t quite believe it. All feels right in the world

Celtic  the Best make a 3 in a row
The players must be knackered no break internationals then pre season no chance to recharge

BR needs to have Celtic more clinical with corners and set pieces. Also defending them too.

Welcome home you beautiful human being you!

God bless you and yours x
A brilliant appointment. To replace a treble winning manager with a double treble winning manager is brilliant from the club. Despite the way he left, he’s the man to continue our dominance. Welcome back Brendan
A true celtic man. A true winner.  A true elite manager. Special times ahead.  WELCOME BACK BRENDAN 🙏  HAIL HAIL
