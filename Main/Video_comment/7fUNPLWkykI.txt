The only woman more hated in America more than Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi is Kathleen Kennedy.  If #Disney wants to save #DisneyStarWars and the rest of their company is to fire Kathleen Kennedy.  I’m not buying or paying for ANYTHING DISNEY until she is gone.  #FireKathleenKennedy  #JusticeForGinaCarano  #WeLoveGinaCarano   #StarWarsFansWillBotBeSilenced  *
I'm with Her, that's right: Gina Carano!
My daughter is crushed. She loves Gina Carano and the Cara Dune character. Kathleen Kennedy took this joy away from her. What do I tell my little girl??
Best show ever
THIS IS THE WAY!!! Love this series. Love Mando. Love Cara Dune. Love Gina Carano. Love Grogu. Love BOBA FETT!!
Yesss non political good content!!
OwO

I love you Mandalorian!!!! SO MUUUUUUUUCH!!!!!!!!
What is the name of this song?
Giancarlo esposito killin it. He in two of the best series out. Mandalorian and The Boys
0:03 is that what I see? Black Sabre like in the animated series.
Guys, look, it’s Gus Fring’s past!
Today is OCT 30
Mandalorians WERE cool...then they became another slop the buffet.
Isn’t anyone else freaking over the return of Boba Fett??? Come on, I can’t be the only one!!! (Reply if you are dying to see him return!!!)
TOMORROW 😁
Seriously who would put a thumbs down on this
In disney plus all the series of Star Wars are in Spanish language or English all?
I Think He Wants Something.
2 DAYS TO GO LADS
Hello there
Giancarlo Esposito is just amazing at everything he does
The clone wars is so much better.
You guys should make more seasons
If you go on 0:03 at a slower speed you will be amazed at what you see
Yooo black lightsaber where did he find that relic
Since when did Star wars have boats? This looks like another instance of Disney doing whatever they want because they don't care, regardless of how much it makes sense compared to the rest of the pre-disney canonical universe
Well I still do NoT have Disney + but the show looks awesome!
So hot
Show of 2020
If only everything Disney Star Wars turned out this good.
3 more days
Let’s just call the show Yodalorian 😂
Is that a boat?  An actual boat on water?
Give it to me
Baby yoda's face when his on the ship Lol XD
ABOUT TIME
Check it out, it’s Stanley Edgar! I guess Vought controls the Star Wars franchise as well
The only reason I’m on Disney+ is because of the Mandalorian. I hope the execs understand that as soon as season 2 is over, I’m canceling my trial
Приветствую
BABI   🐷🐷🐷
*chants* AHSOKA! AHSOKA! AHOSKA!!
nice
I would like this music please
(ray mak is typing)
Great series!!!
I am a Time traveler from the year 2070
Is there only one season coming
Hey Disney like what you doing can we get some old republic too ?
Who had to rewatch season 1 just so you can be prepared for season 2
Season 1 is to let em know what’s up, season 2 is to set the bar, and season 3 is to blow everyone away
omg yoder!!!!
Yes, please!!!!!!!!!!  😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
Jon Favreau is a legend
hey, here
The only thing that’s keeping Star Wars relevant.
And just like that I forgot about corona
The mandolorian is better then the new movies tbh.
Hell ya, everyone’s favorite show is about to come out
Does Star Wars have boats now?
Mandalorian : Oh you playing Minecraft   The Child : ........  Mandalorian : I like ya cut g
Am I the only one who absolutely loves that black lightsaber?
Mandalorian Pog
Let’s gooooo bois
OMG YESS
Looking forward to it, pretty cool 😎
Why do I feel like cara dune is gonna die in season 2?
claim your here before 1m token here
*"May the force be with you!"*
1 week!!
I really wish that some confirmation on Ahsoka, Boba, or Rex appeared in the trailers. All I can do is hope for the best.
Why is Gustavo Fring in  space
This is what star wars suppose to be unlike the movies they twisted 🤣 of course they hired the right man for the job. Best move they made for star wars, finally something I will watch and pay for .
Giancarlo Esposito is everywhere. Just finished the boys. And now mandalorian.
So very tired of Giancarlo
First super heroes, now jedi
Is it only one ep or all release at once?
When like the third trailer gets released for the same show within a couple weeks “a surprise to be sure but a welcome one”
I’m in! 2020 shitshow be damned!
He wants the blue stuff.
Ayyy he got one of those
Ok, I hate most of Disney’s choices lately because instead of just making good products they’re instead being politically correct, but I’ll check this video series out because everyone is saying this is the exception and it’s really good.
Well time for another free trial ya ya ya
Time to pirate this
Been waiting 😁
Do you think that could have been hoth? Or possibly illum? Illum would be cool since he is looking for jedi.
Dude baby returns
Can’t wait to make a new free trial account to binge it!😊😂
I loved the first season but its been so long i forgot the whole storyline
MORE Wokeness from Disney.. I'm out
#BringBenSoloBack
Once this season comes out, and in a couple years, the Obi Wan series, I could finally say I'd pick Star Wars over Marvel.
I’ve got a bad feeling about this. I have spoken
Why would anybody use boats in Star Wars?
That Dark Sabre didn’t translate well to screen
0:27 somebody smokin deathsticks in the background
This show actually makes Star Wars Better.... Each episode played more like a movie.... very excited for the return.... don’t waist time and start filming the next 3 seasons.... Jon Favreau get that going.....
Be prepared for more disappointment,,,,,
Almost every person I know will probably be watching this 😂
Clip of a boat? Is this prior to spaceships or anything else that flies or hovers? Looking forward to finding out but sorry Disney. You lost any chance of getting another dollar out of me until you rehire all those employees you fired, quit complaining about current conditions and adapt like Walt would do and make it work out.
UNLIMITED POWER!!!!!!
Finally holy geez
FINALLY ANOTHER SEASON!  I Cant wait!🎉🥳🎉
This might be the reason I buy disney plus for a month
Alrigggght been waiting for this💯
I cant thsinfnk
The craziest part is I wasn’t even a Star Wars fan but, the Mandalorian... I’m a new convert and I’ve seen the light!
I like how they are risking getting sick just to make us happy. I will appreciate this season very well.
It is actually not the way
K'oyacyi
Yessss im ready
This season is the high ground
Boats in Star Wars? Can’t a ship just you know float over the water lol?
Mr White this is the wrong universe
Try spinning, it’s a good trick.
I’m not paying for Disney plus the company has lost their minds
Pretty looking show with no story or substance whatsoever.
Now this is pod racing
The Black Saber!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
black lightsaber black lightsaber black lightsaber this is important but my pea-brain does not remember w h y
YeeeeeeeEEEEEAAAAAAAAA BOOOOIIIIIIII!!!!!!
Bro I have been waiting forever just for season 3 I mean I see the problem it's covid-19
Omg finally!!!🤩🤩
The baby returns to shine😻
Will be the greatest Star Wars show of all time and will keep viewers so long as SJW politics are kept out
How cute ... But not really
I've got a good feeling about this
Estoy viendo el video pero lavoz del creeo que es el locutor quenarra es muy fea mucricaturesca  com sediria en mexico lepone demasiada crema azuz tacos talvez sea para llamar la agencio  pero lavoz muy fea y siofendo perdon no fue mi intencion gracoas
Bro the music hits
Why the stunningly boring thumbnail? I’ve scrolled past this like 8 time before realizing what it was.
Hello there  Disney:General lacmin
I have a good feeling about this
So excited for this!
So let me get this straight,they have baby carriers,and vehicles,and spaceships,that can fly pretty much anywhere,but still boats that float on water
I'm excited, but was the cliché super hero landing really necessary?
Los Pollos Hermanos will be mine!!
I’m a shareholder of Disney
I have to be honest.  I don't know what all the hype is about. I didn't think it was that great. I mean,  it was ok.
Now this is definitely the way
Hello folks and God bless you all today stay safe everyone .
*I like those odds*
hey that guy is manager of los pollos hermanos
Ich hab Bock
Türkiye'e gelin artık.
What music is this?
Help us mandalorion your our only hope
Our long awaited meeting, shall come at last.
This is gonna be fun I have spoken
The People Who disliked this are friends of moff gideon
*IMO this is the true sequel*
Who's the voice at the end?
If Ashoka isn’t in it I’m not watching it
Giancarlo Esposito is the best!
I have spoken
get this on trending
I really wish Paz Vizsla gets a bigger role.
0:06 The music is so breaking bad that I think they added it because of Giancarlo(Gus)
Esposito is hell of an actor, i hope he will make this character cool, dangerous, badass and scary like Gustavo Fring can’t wait seeing this with my dad
Can't wait for the soundtrack of this trailer to be released
ok
The biggest question: Why do they use a boat when they have spaceships?
yay my junior year has some slight meaning again, but i'll take it
I never thought i would like any new Star Wars since 1983 but i must say that this series is pretty amazing so far. I am really looking forward to season 2.
The only thing that sounds awful is the word Disney ar the end, is out of place
This is the way.
I guess no Halloween for me I’m going to binge watch this instead on my day off ((:
Moff Gideon: you have something I want   Me: come get it!
It's incredible how this TV series is saving the SW franchise by fixing what a 3-part big-budget trilogy wrecked almost beyond repair.
has mando lost some weight..? looks a bit skinnier this time around
Initiate excited screams sequence
Only 2 more weeks until season 2s first episode!!! I swear the second my Online school zoom call ends I am rushing to Disney plus to watch this
Bro mandos gonna die doin this
Ashoka aparecerá en esta segunda temporada?
Can’t wait 😊
This Is The Month!
(1/3 Batman + 1/3 Ironman + 1/3 Lone Wolf & Cub) * Man With No Name = The Mandalorian
you have something i want it be will my
If my calculations are correct there is only a 2.23 percent chance this season will disappoint me
Barely any new footage it was mostly footage from the last trailer and stock footage
- You have something I want! - Yes, the new season is here.😎
The video uses an ultrawide aspect ratio, why don't upload it as such?  That way people with an ultrawide monitor can enjoy it more.  Thanks in advance.
I hope you guys are doing wonderful and vote me for prez
This is butiful
This is the way!
kiedy to w końcu bo będzie w Polsce :/
0:25  I see what you did here, Jon Favreau. - Every Youtuber Ever
Can you watch it without disney plus?it is not in my country yet
Is it true Pedro Pascal quit the Mandalorian?
my hype is through the universe right now!!
I hite  te manderlorin
fyi: if you have disney plus, guess what day i am coming over? i will bring the snacks!
Screw Disney plus
Yea the first half of the season  will be good. Second half is what I'm scared about.
I Firmly believe that the only thing that could out do The Mandalorian is the Original Star Wars Expanded Universe.
COME ON AHSOKA DON’T FAIL US NOW
Just gimme it now, please...
YES!!!
THIS PROVES THAT I AM STILL CUTE
youtu.be/R5MnjY08-Fc
But Pedro Pascal isn’t mando anymore :(
We follow the Way.
I hope this new Filoni verse means a modern golden era for SW, as a brand they really need it after the disaster of the secuels and Solo. Kenobi, Cassian series, Ezra and Thrawn, The Bad Batch, Ashoka and Satine, we'll see
Brilliant
This feels like a Super Bowl Trailer
I'm so hyped for Season 2!!
Super Hero Landing!    oooh, so hard on the knees...
Just 15 more days!!! 🤯
The odds of successfully creating a quality Star Wars series with Lucasfilm and Disney in 2020 is approximately 3720 to 1. Favreau/Filoni: Never tell me the odds..
yepyepyep !! I love it !
Counting down the days. This is the wait.
I love this show!!!!!
Can ppl stop using Ironmans landing?
*REEEEE THE CGI SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!*
This is too freakin cool. Im in.
This is the way
Let the game BEGIN
The mandalorian one of the best tv show!
I dont know this is just me mando is sound soooo kurdish
"You have something I want..."  Me: *Star Wars legos*
Please make deathtroopers stronger
Yes yes yes
Who else is excited about 2 seconds of new footage?
LETS GO
DO it! Give that series to us earlier !
Ohh, I've Got A Good Feeling About This.
We haven't got the whole first season yet 😩
can't watch, dumb country restrictions
Looks good. Too bad Disney supports human rights abuses in China and hoped we would not notice.
May the force be with you. 😎✊
I love the western vibe the Mandalorian has
I just hope that they don't ruin it like they have with everything else.
let the Hype begin!
Ahsoka Tano I can feel her presence _so close, so close_
"Fighter crashed saved the day Your welcome"
Tellement hâte cette série est vraiment bien il font pas de merde pour une fois Disney
To the haters spreading lies; Remember...Kathleen Kennedy is still CEO of LucasFilm...  Remember that, when you pass judgement on the new season of Mando...  ps. and no... The ceo does not get banned from the set of any of the productions for obvious reasons.
Now THIS is podracing!
Featuring the voice of Pedro Pascal and his stunt double.
How much blue do you want?  Disney: yes
But where’s Ashoka
Thank god for torrents, and the people who upload! 🙏
YouTube: what are you doing? Me: taking one last look sir...at the trailer.  S2 is here to save Star Wars and 2020
0:14 to 0:16. Is this the forgotten martial art Teras Kasi? Came to the comments section because of a link about this.   Feel free to share about this, I'm not familiar with Legends
😦
The mandolorian is so cool
Hello there
I cant wait more 2 weeks
The crew's back! The crew's back!  And he's got a jetpack! He's got the high ground! Obi-wan would be proud
Mando looking shiny....
THIS IS THE WAY
Los Pollos Hermanos
this best save 2020
I don't care
Sabine clips, please!
This is the only thing that can save 2020
I have low expectations because it's Disney but hey it might be good going off of this
Terrible trailer
If you're reading this comment hope you will have a nice day 💎💫🎉❤🤗🤗
This looks great like the first season but I can’t be the only one who noticed the weird color grading at the beginning right?
Is this even real?
Give it to me already aghhh
Omg omg omg omg omg my life
That black lightsaber doe 😳
This is the way.
This is the way.
Can’t wait!!
U
Dancing dancing 💃
@ Once Upon A Time fans: So this is where Sidney Glass ended up 🤔
Yassssss
gf.me/u/y4uha2 🙏💞
Beautiful!!! NOW SHOW US AHSOKA
I'm exited for sasha banks / mercedes to be into there!
It's over Sequel Trilogy, the Mandalorian has the high ground!
I really do wish I could watch this on regular television; this's a promising show of true maturity in a lot of ways.
This is getting out of hand! Now there are two of them!!!
the child omg sweet boy 🥺 ALSO MANDO LOOKS SO BADASS IM SO EXCITED
I truly feel The Mandalorian saved the Star Wars franchise. This show captures the true essence of Star Wars unlike the last Star Wars films that weren't all that good.
Justice for Seal Team 6. See “Benghazi betrayal, Charles Woods, Nick Noe”
Netflix: u have something i want.. Disney: ignites lightsaber..
This soundtrack... Oh god... I hope this music starts when boba fett appears on screen
You have something I want..... it WILL be mine
Boba Fett please
The music is just amazing
WHERE IS AHSOKA???
Disney Plus has something I want! It will be mine!
Dam can’t wait to listen to that soundtrack
Quite a step up from Los Pollos Hermanos, Gus...
This is the way
This is the way
Walt Disney is a 33 degree free mason who puts illuminati and child predator symbols in his films screw Freemasons like him
This is the way.
Are the DVD's out there for Season 1 legit?
This has breaking bad vibes, which is not a bad a thing
I hope everything with Pedro has been or can be sorted out.
its already a masterpiece
This season better have Ahsoka...
This is the way
Cool but it will still be bad except for Giancarlo
This Is The Way.
Can’t wait
This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them.
Yeah right
I have a question for you who believe that there’s no God and that nothing made the universe. If this is true. Then if God is no-thing and therefore is nothing. Then can’t the universe come from him?  Also if you believe that the universe is infinite; then how is it that our bodies are part of the universe whilst our consciousness is also part of our bodies whilst our consciousness came into existence via our birth? This means that our consciousness is finite because it began, there for our bodies are finite and finally the universe MUST be finite...
Gus Fringggggg
good WAHAHAHAHAHA
Whoa a boat?? In starwars??? When everything can fly?? I am sold
Hello there
Can't wait!
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates♦️Non-Duality
John Boyega should pray to be Disney+'d
So who wants to watch this with me on Halloween
Bob Chapek - "Okay, so we're going to delete that dumpster fire Kathleen Kennedy sequel trilogy and focus on the awe inspiring Filoni/ Favreau Mandalorian series going forward. Let's bring Star Wars back to the way it is meant to be and then maybe reboot the sequel trilogy with the original cast and do a better job this time." Real Star Wars fans - "This is the way"
IM SO HYPED!!!!!!  Also: Moff Gideon: YOU HAVE SOMETHING I WANT! IT WILL BE MINE. Mando: No.
Is it me, or is anything with Giancarlo Esposito something great, or legendary? The Boys, Breaking Bad, this show, Once Upon a Time..
I've wanted to see boats for ages!
Giancarlo Esposito has one of the best voices ever
The dislikes are stormtroopers that missed the like button
The only reason I may watch this season is for Gus Fring
This show would be so much better if this season had a more focused story throughout
Are they still doing single episode releases a week?
#awready
Epic
This is the way
I loved this program so good !
I can only hear the dentist from payday 2
Gus vader over here looks like he's wearing a Halloween costume.
I just finished watching The Boys S2. The main villain in that show was really good.   Now it’s time to watch The Mandolorian S2 and the main villain from S1 is really good too.   I wonder if those actors know each other in real life.
The only reason anyone gets Disney plus
Can't wait!!!
Gustavo running a drug business, a chicken business, a superhero business and now he’s in SPACE!
Dat fett return....can just hear it now ”you’re comin with me.... (boba fett chronicles) ✌️
thats the only reason i pay for disney plus
Where the fun begins, this is.
Lowkey hoping we at least get a Boba or a Jango Fett reference
Some Star Wars fans: please overstuff this signature series with my favs from other shows/movies. Other fans: No don't ruin it keep it PURE. Disney: Wow, we see many, many spinoffs and many dollars in our future. Mucho dolares! Pass the champagne!  HBO: We hates you, precioussssss, yes, yes, we do....  All fans:  just sayin', I will totally lose it if the 'net crashes Oct 30. TOTALLY. We need our Baby fix.
Hopefully they use this season to retcon the Sequel Trilogy out of existence. It is the way.
We are going close!
This is the way
Looks so good
BABY BABY BABY
CAN WE SKIP TO OCT. 30TH ALREADY 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
thumbnail looks like mando and yode at the subway
Trash
Baby Yodi: ._. Niemand:   Ich: Milcheinschuß!
Somebody cashapp me $1. I’m trying to see something $igobyprice
I want to review this for my youtube channel 🩸🔥
🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🧨🧨🎖🎖🥇🎖🥇🧨🧨🎯🎯🧨🧨🎖🎖🥇🎯🎯🧨🎖♠️
This is where the juicy fun begins!!!
This is the way!
Still haven't watched the first season I'm on episode 2.
I could definitely see this have up to six or seven Seasons maybe even more if it’s made correctly
]
*_This is the way_*
here we go, pirate pages :v
Hell yea its back 😭
heterogametic neb
The only time i will quote something out of ST: "More......, more............ mooooooore !"
Is she in the trailer?  Ta-no
This is awesome. But the music SUCKS.
This is the Way
say something Mando.... why he quiet though ?
Where is the second trailer????????
Gus Fring gonna get you!!!
That music though..
This is the way
WOW! Zero new footage!
Still can't see Ahsoka being in it... which is sad, but also she deserves her own series.
My theory they will find baby yodas home at the end of the series
#MandalorianHype
Ahhhhhhhhhhh so excited
wow !!
This brings me back to my childhood...that original trilogy feeling
can't wait for mandalor season 2 bring in on give us Ezra Sabin and ashoka.
Is this real?
🔥
Hello there
So far from what I’ve seen no ones social distancing
Huge respect to the master - Jon Favreau !
Anything with Giancarlo Esposito is automatically good.
oh yeah baby!
I was hoping for ahsoka but they gonna save the best for last imagine if they showed ahsoka when the very first trailer came out everybody would have been more.excited but this.still works :D
Video too short...
Oh boy, I can tell that scene where they're on a ship is going to involve a massive underwater creature
When this trailer makes you more excited than anything else in the trilogy
Does mandalorian in neutralism ? Neither helping the empire nor the rebellion?
#caralorian
Disney: are you still watching? Me: yes
This is the way
Boba, Boba Fett. Where?
Wondering where ahsoka is
if this flops because disney forces them to use it to make the sequel trilogy better (kinda like what clone wars did for the prequels) then 2020 is officially the worst year ever
At last
This series' powers have doubled since the last time we met.
Oh no.   Spoiler guess     He must get the Child and Mando’s team has to go on the Star Destroyer to rescue him?
OH MAAAAAAAAAAN!!
This is the way
I've been looking forward to this
Good, still no boba or ahsoka though.
Remember when this show was meant to he about the dark bounty hunter life lol...
When we have Disney+ in Poland?
I’m so excited I am spending my hole day today binge watching season 1
This trailer, another fine addition to my collection!
Think everyone will cancel disney+ again once the season is over?
Nice👍🏻
Superhero landing!
When will this and the rest of season one come to disney+ in europe?
Star Wars Fans: “You have something I want”😌  Disney: Couple more days😉
Pickup your visual scanning.....
I just watched the mandelorian and it was awesome, im looking forward for the next season.
Hype
And still no familiar face..
Give me more
This is the way.
From what i guess: Din, Cara and Griff Will team up to go to that Navaro Underground rock base to de-establish it so that The lava below erupts and destroys The base. We can See it here but that's after Din escape using Jet Pack and landing because The lava is about to errupt so all the ties  escapes.  Seeing Griff in a ship turrent makes me think its either Razor or another ship because i dont remember The Razor having a turrent like Falcon.   Anyway: The more i See, The more im ready! Our hype for Season 2 grows every Day now!
16 days to gooo :D
Trailer, you're shorter than I expected
Goosebumps anyone. Hell ya!!
There is Ashoka
He finaly got one of those
Hyped!! Can’t wait!!
0:21 Looks like this series may start where it left off.
I got Breaking Bad vibes from the beginning of this trailers score. Especially when I saw Mr Esposito.
I got Breaking Bad vibes from the beginning of this trailers score. Especially when I saw Giancarlo.
A few weeks ago.......   You don't have to stay in doors any longer, lockdowns over.  Now:"Indoors is where the fun begins !!!"

Me during lockdown:😞😞😞  Post lockdown:"This is where the fun begins"!!!
Post lockdown:"This is where the fun begins"!!!
"This is where the fun begins"!!!
All I'll say is.    "This is where the fun begins"!!!
Superhero landing! Superhero landing!
Firat
0:23 looks like Gideon was sniffing some deathsticks
even without clue, i still got chill
2:44 Beautiful 💋💋love u💋💋
the only reason why 99% of the people are subscribed to Disney+
Please give us season 1 on DVD and Blu-ray already!
THIS IS THE BEST THING ON TELLY IN 2020............................. HELL YEA !!
hope they get taika in for a few more episodes
#WeAreTheWay
High ground at 0:25
This is the way.
I don't want this season fail it's sequel don't fail the new season
I am happy that this teaser is only 30 sec long. Otherwise i would have died holding my breath.
legit gonna be the only reason I pay for Disney +... and I'm not gonna be able to mind doing it!
I watched the show without watching the movies, and i adored i immediately started watching star wars movies after that, now I'm a fanboy
Why i can't see star wars rebels 2 season.. And i live in finland
Go on Disney this is the way.
This is the way!!!!
Oh my god! I can't wait second season!!!
The odds of this series sucking are approximately 3720 to 1
Таков путь.
Pls launch mandalorian in hindi also!!!
who also hoped to see Ahsoka?
Fans: you have something i want!     Ahsoka in mandalorian season 2
THIS IS THE WAY. 🔥 I HAVE SPOKEN. 😢
time for more cut action bois
Ill restart mg sub when this drops :) love this show!!!
You get a thumb down for no subtitles. 🤨
THIS IS THE WAY
Me watching S1: YOOOO THE DARKSABBBERRR My dad watching with me: Hm?
This should help wash away the taste of Rise of Skywalker.
I just want to see what Ahsoka Tano looks like.
Please have ryan Johnson direct the next season. He was a good director
Awesome Star Wars: The Mandalorian Video.
Do you know what the chances are of this being good? It's high. Very high
This is the way
I am rly afraid that mandalorian will be canceled one day It costs insane amount of money to make one episode And with covid, it's even harder For now, I am happy we can enjoy it And I hope we will not lose it
I saw Sabine Wren
TV series is the way...     I have spoken.
Rerally love the music! Is this going to be a full theme releasing later?
Am I the only one who gets major Fallen Order vibes?
I can NOT wait to hear the full version of this theme song.  Mr. Goransson strikes again!
So hyped for this!
YES! This is the way...
I just love the acting. Whoever hired these stormtroopers did an excellent job and deserves a pay raise!
I was hoping for Ahsoka
this is the way
I can't wait!
You make think you know what you are in possession of you do not.
0:13 that song gives me breaking bad vibes
The Lack of Kathleen Kenedy  flows with this show
The soundtrack is epic. Hope Ludwig Göransson would be a  legend like John Williams in Star Wars community.
OKAY THIS IS THE WAY.
Where is Lady Tano? Is she safe, is she alright?
Amazing
I’m so hyped for this but as soon as this comes out my dad has to leave for next 4 months, I’m gonna miss him😭
This is the way.
Long have I waited...
The mandalorian is going to finish 2 seasons before any Marvel Studios show starts Season 1, WOW the creative team is really passionate about this show!
THIS IS THE WAYYY 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wish Disney plus was in my country
"MORE GIVE ME MORE"         - Pervy the purge trooper

Star Wars has spoken
It's going to be terrible since Disney has 100% focus on this show now because all the shows and movies are done
The mandalorian. It’s literally only about yodas life story 😂
I am at the edge of my seat right now, can’t wait till it comes.
Where is boba fett ?
Chiccy nuggies

THAT SCORE
I was hoping for a full trailer.
THIS IS THE WAY

This Is The Way!:)
CANT WAIT FOR OCTOBER 30
this is better than sequels😁
Canon question: do all Ties fold like that meow or are these special variants? Because I could see his personal Moff Tie being special, but that got destroyed.
Yes
Looks like sullust!
Favreau and Filoni not spoiling anything for season 2 lol.
Can we see ahsoka please?
😍😍😍
I have a good feeling about this.
Disney! Why couldn't you have made the star wars new movies as good as this series??? Stop holding on! Fresh is good! No more recycling, re-envision
Yeet
THIS IS THE WAY!
No spoilers, yet still intriguing. This is the way (all trailers should be)
Who will win?  Some random imperial with a fake lightsaber  Or   The apprentice of the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy
So badass
Look boba fett in the back guys you missed it
Excellent!  #StarWars  #TheMandalorian  #DisneyPlus
Anyone else think the TIE Fighters & stormtroopers are on Sullust? Lava, burned up magma & clear skys.
I'm really digging this new music. Ludwig Gorranson is an up-and-coming genuis in creating music.
😁🙌😁🙌😁🙌😁🙌
The one flying up from the fire, it kinda looks like there is a red stripe on the armor
This is the way...
This could probably save 2020
This is the way
This is the way
i love this bro
THIS IS THE WAY
When it went, errruhhhUHH, I felt that
.I have something no one wants, space horses....lolol......
Imagine how legendary it would be if Darth Vader joined the show🤞🤞
Hopefully the writing is better and all the characters actually have interesting personalities
Nice
Fun fact I binged the first season in one day ! This is the way 🤣🤍
At least give us a Kenobi teaser trailer.
That part where Cara gets up was hot
I thought it was funny how the trailer for season 1 of this and season 1 of Wandavision shows how little faith disney had in this show. I’m happy that disney gave this show the money it deserves
Me frantically searching for a glimpse of anything that resembles a Torgruta.
So ready
Baby yoga be like me go bye bye in this trailer I used the force to disappear
This is the way.
I would like to see ahsoka tano
Give me Ashoka Tano 🙏
This is the way.
Now this is podracing
Nice jokes and cuts at the end
Is this the delayed trailer?
Lets go
Man, Disney’s best Star Wars content HAS to be the Mandalorian. *Change my mind.*
HECK YEAH
Epic
I'm so ready!
Idk why my mind went Orto Plutonia 0:12 from the clone wars, the setup looks just like it too tho (the snow planet from S1 E15)
Stormfront comes back in Mando as Darth Muder
Taking a guess. They get the child and they have to safe him
My birthday yea
Now this is pod racing
Finally, no more of the SQ's bs
If he removes his helmet I am going to quit
Doesn’t the black saber belong to the mandoloarins so if the guy who has it die they get there saber back
This is the way
*[Insert Prequel Meme Here]*
I’ve been looking forward to this
2 more weeks and counting. Can't wait to see Ahsoka and Boba fett.
Please show us Rosario Dawson I’m literally foaming at the mouth
SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
quick, inject this into my veins, I cannot continue to live without it. PepeHands
Why does his armor look cleaner than the season finale  of season 1 he must have gotten more beskar some how
Love that Mr. Edgar is in this.
I thought it was October 20th?
I AM SOOO HYPED!! This season is going to be so sick ,I really enjoyed the first one, and I'm definitely looking forward to this one. There's so many possibilities of characters appearing that we haven't see on live action before!
This is the way!
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one  But I need to see the real second trailer
The new music sounds amazing
I've been looking forward to this.
Alrighty then!
0:25 Mustafar or the Citadel??🤔
Wait I thought Gus Fring was blown up by Hector?
Clone wars is better
I was hoping for Ahsoka... Why isn't she here...
Literally just got Disney+. LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
This is the way
This better not go woke
mustafar
hype hype Hype Hype HYPE HYPE! HYPE! HYPE!! HYPE!!! (join me!)
I have a good feeling about this.
Be honest this is the only reason you still have disney plus
Breaking news: Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin is suffering from severe backpain as a result of carrying the whole star wars franchise
Absolutely. Brilliant.
0:25 is that mustafar?
Me compass says, yes this is indeed the way....
The Mandalorian is one of the best shows on any streaming service- I have spoken.
Was this delayed? I could've sworn this was coming out in mid October...
Plot twist: The real reason Gideon wants The Child is because its blood can be used to create more Compound V
Looking forward to this, I have been.
This and clone wars are Star Wars!!!
0:25 Superman is The Mandalorian
Let the fun begin. T-minus 17 days.
Was that Sullest?
Sucks that we have to wait every week for a new episode! It’s not a tv show! It’s on a streaming service. Can’t binge watch it unless you wait for all the episodes of the season to come out and that’s a pain. Wish they would just release all the episodes at once for those who like to binge watch like myself.  Great show though!
My body is ready.
Bet
This is the way!!!
This is the way.
Is that a boat?! In Star Wars?   Weird.
THIS IS THE WAY
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!
THERE WAS A SHOT OF ILLUM IT HAD TO BE
Ooh, a boat that actually sails in water. That's rare for Star Wars.
To the people who are commenting "This is the way" to get likes.        This is the way
*THIS IS THE MF WAY!*
It’s the superhero landing!...really does a number on your knees
SABEN ASHOKA      WHERE YO AT....?..??😀😁
COVID: We have you outnumbered four to one. Filoni: I like those odds.
SLYSIC
I’m excited for my show to come out! Can’t wait for all of u to watch it.... :)
Pedro Pascal IS the Mandalorian
Can someone tell me why the tie fighters are folding
Honestly still quite mehhh and nothing special...
This is the way
Sooooooo EPIC !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!!
This is the way!!!!  Gideon : you have something I want .
:)
I've been looking forward to this.
👎👎👎
The trailers cool and all but that music?   Ohh that got me grinnin from ear to ear.   This gonna be good.
I am excited!
Where is ahsoka, is she alright, is she safe?
Looks cool but needs more blue
God the music for this is sick
A mostly peaceful series
*Where is Ashoka?*
wheres my meth Mr white
I'm on boat!
J.J. Abrams: You underestimate my power of mystery boxes!!!!  John Favreau and The Mandalorian team: we have the high ground you fool.
Surprised no one mentioned Greef being a turret gunner; we get to have another ship added to canon.
10 tHIngS YoU MiST iN ManDoLOriAn SeaSoN 2 TRaiLeR
My Sister:You Have Something I Want.... It will be Mine.  Me:Not if I sell it first for...the ps5.
This comes out 2 days after my 21st birthday
Well, I'm ready. And, that superhero pose landing...Ming Na Wen would approve.
Long have I waited...
I've been looking forward to this.
We can probably expect a little snipbit of the show almost every day
now this is the way!
the child has returned fellow jedi and sith ;))
Trailer: no spoilers Me: This is the way
The Madalorian was so much better than the new Star Wars trilogy. I hope Jon Favreau takes over the franchise
That looks hella good
SUPER HERO LANDING!
I have a good feeling about this!
Will the whole season come out all at once or once at week? I'm new to this
You know what else is streaming Oct 30         the owl house!
yo esperando a la sombra del imperio para hacer un analisis de esto
I SAW SULLUST!!!!
Thank god they filmed this before the lock down
Now this is where the fun begins...
I really hope the assault on the Imperial Base on Nevarro is in the first episode. Start the season off with a bang.
Excited to see Ahsoka in live action! Still wish it was Ashley playing the character But Hopefully it's Ashley doing the voice work!
The Mandalorian came to make 2020 worthwhile
*AHHHHHHHHHHH*
No one:   Absolutely no one:  Me screaming at the top of my lungs: THIS IS THE WAY
So hyped.!!!!!! Hopefully we get all episodes at once and not weekly.! 😭🙏🏼💐
The amount of dumb fan theories I see in these comments just shows you peasants have never seen Clone Wars 😂
Mesa see Jar Jar, oops those are Quarrens 😆
“It is the way” to watch this the second it gets released on Disney +
This is the way
I would like to see the baby
Oberyn Martell carries Green Stitch to try and run away from Gus Fring: The Series
Is that Mustafar!?
This is the way
This is the way.
“You have something I want.” Yeah. *SEASON TWO.*
Sullust whaaaat omg
Moff Gideon is the least intimidating villain I've ever seen in Star Wars.
Now if only Disney + was available in my country.
Yesssssssiiiirrrrrrrr THIS IS THE WAY
Yes
Make notes JJ and Rian... This is how you make Star Wars!
😱😱😱
I can't believe mandalorian was second most anticipated shows instead of first         First one was his dark materials that makes no sense
This is even better than Star Wars itself, but Star Wars is still good.
This is the way
🔥
Holy Shiii- Dis Month!!!???
this is the way i cant wait for season 2
I hope we see some familiar characters
I’m re-watching season one on Disney+
Should put it on Prime so it could be a bit more violent
Some new footage, looks like Sullest from Battlefront 1 lol
When the new season drops on ur birthday so u r now a certified   JEDI
I have spoken.
Give me another trailer
Quickly becoming my favorite part of the Star Wars Universe.
I got a feeling this is all from the first episode because it’s more of the stuff we’ve already seen
This is the way
0:16 thats definitely a decommissioned hammerhead frigate (or corvette)
Hello There
I can't get enough of the music on this show! So awesome!
Disney get ready to take my money!
Cant wait to pirate this
Execute October 30th already
Just show us Ahsoka don’t be shy
That music though. . .😁
The Mandalorian is carrying Star Wars right now.
Disney Plus Star Wars: "It's Over Movies, I have The *Better Script* " Star Wars Movies: "You Underestimate My Power!" Disney Plus Star wars: "Don't Do It! Don't Divide The Fandom!"
More Mando... More Carl Weathers... More Gina Carano...  Sold.
I cried for joy !! Finally something good in 2020
I was hoping to see the live action version of Ahsoka 😥😭
NOW THIS IS POD RACING!!!!
This series shows that Disney can do Star Wars right. They should show that more often though.
Leeeeets go.
I'm soo ready... This is the way
YAHOO!!😆  A NEW SEASON OF "THE MANDALORIAN" IS COMING TO Disney+ with a whole new Allies, like Ashoka and Ezra from "Star Wars: The Clone Wars" and "Star Wars: Rebels", which is travel back in time!!!  And now, it's time to collect that bounty!!!
AYOO
The Mandalorian's about to release its second season and you guys haven't even released D+ in Latin America yet, been saying it for a year but it looks like you guys want your content pirated.
So is the whole season gonna be available on Oct 30th? Or is it gonna be an episode a week?
This show saved Star Wars
yessiir
Waiting for Boba vs Mando.
Well.. I have to say it.. THIS IS THE WAY.
“I’ve been looking forward to this”  (Count Dooku Voice)
This is the way
FOR MANDALORE
Explain why Greef Karga is going to have a white beard... Is there going to be a huge time jump? Otherwise it's too inconsistent.
This is the way
This Is The Way.
shortest 30 seconds of my life
WHERE IS AHSOKA??!! 😭😭😭😭
It will be my... That being... the power to see who wins the 2020 election
HE GOT A JETPACK!
looks at the date. Realises its still two weeks away. *R2-D2 Screams from the bottom of my heart*
*Mando lands after using jetpack* Me: Wooo! Superhero landing!! You know, thats really hard on your knees.
Boring
Sullust!!!
I hope fett is in it
Mmm gotta love that Mandalorian jetpack!
I would rather watch this than the last three Star Wars movies back to back
bUt wHeReS aHsOkA?
This is the slowest month ever
THE HYPE IS ON I'm really excited😎
My body is literally turning inside out right now
I can’t wait 🔥🔥🔥
Im glad to see more Cara Dune and Greef Karga in this trailer.
I’d like to see the baby
Now this my friends is... STAR WARS.
Now I must rewatch the first season. This is the way.
This is the way.
While I am hyped for the season, I’m more hyped for Boba Fett
That People: Wait there are black lightsabers?  Me who has watched Clone Wars and Rebels: I find your lack of Star Wars knowledge disturbing
Whys the picture quality this season look terrible? I'm on the highest frame rate and it still blurry as hell
This is the way
Fire Kathleen Kennedy
Meh.... 😒
0:25 Another happy landing
This is the way
I've waited for this moment for a long, long time
Let’s go bois! Only 17 more days
Faloni is the truth
Finally a new trailerrrrrRrRrRRRRRR. Even if there are only a couple extra bits of footage, whatever, I'm happy. I know they really don't want to reveal too much about the new season, and idk, I'm honestly fine with leaving some surprises and guessing. I'm so excited for the 30th
uhhhhhhhhhhh October 30 pleaseeee hurry upppp
Literally every Giancarlo Esposito show will have him eventually say “You have something I want.”
I love how vague the promotions are. This is why I’m looking forward even more than ever.
He Has The High Ground
0:25 Super Hero Landing
Imagine they made it u have to have premium like mulan
Never thought I’d see the day when a tv show would save the series
me: wow! a new video! I wonder what new scenes or footage they will show!  disney: *nah fam here have some old S1 clips and the old trailer clips*
I would like to see the -child- first episode.
Iron man Landing I see what you did there Favrue
"I have a GOOD feeling about this"
Oh it’s beautiful
This is the way
HYPE
This music is so good.
I do have something you want  My subscription
Whoooo
This is the way!
*Always two seasons there are. No more, no less*
I'm going to be busy this month and next. Mando. de dlc. Ac valhalla. Cyberpunk. I'll take my birthday gifts now pls
I can't wait to see it
Shut up and take my money
“This is where the fun begins...” I mean– “This is the way”
Well the mandalorian is the one star wars thing disney has released (I don't count clone wars personally) that I don't hate, season 1 was rough but fun so hopefully season 2 irons out the kinks
"You have something I want. It will be mine."   Not on my watch!
0:02 When the kid at the Lego store grabs the last 501st battle pack
This is the way bois  *wE aRe home*
Not just the Mandalorian, but the Womandalorian and Childrendalorian too
Man-Doe‼️
He's wants the Compound V right? That's what he's after?
Yeah... I guess this is the way.
Looks like he got himself one of those.
Yes!!
I’m so exciting!!
Great VOUGHT is coming for our son.
I’m gonna watch this at night and eat a bunch of Halloween candy this will be a fun time
wow
Me: this part of my life, this little part of my Life, is called Happiness. '' this is the way ''.
MORE MORE MORE!!!
I have never clicked on a video so fast in my life
LETS GOO
This is how many people like star wars 👇
Just set your phone/computer to October 30 and watch this early lmao cheating the system
THIS IS THE WAY
What time on the 30th though?
Can’t wait
I just hope Mandalorian doesn't connect in any way to the sequel trilogy, cause in my mind sequel trilogy is not canon, it's just bad fan fiction that completelly ruins whole saga
I’m excited for this
this is going to be so good!!
I NEED TO SEE MORE:(
Wait is that the prison Anakin and obi wan broke into to save that general dude in clone wars? (With fire hole)
Dislikes are from the people involved in S.W. 7-8-9! :)

Man
Yeah boy!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm excited because these trailers haven't revealed much so I'm hoping for some pretty big surprises to come!
The Mandalorian is the John wick of Star Wars
Disney: How can we do Star Wars well? The Mandalorian: '' this is the way ''.
DEN OF NERDS!! ASSEMBLE!!!
thank god more content
can't wait for star wars channels to stretch this out into a 12 minute long video "analyzing" few seconds of new footage that don't show that much
I've been waiting for this...
here we goooooo
I am hyped for season 2 in two weeks from now
WOOOOOO
Ahsoka when?
Some people that watch the Mandalorian, don’t even know anything about Star Wars, which is annoying to think about, but it’s cool.
Long have I waited
I just watched the entire series and right after I find this
Patiently waiting for Samuel Kim to make an epic version of the trailer music.
This is looking cleaner
Hello there
I feel like all there is to be said is “This is the way”
I cant wait to watch this wonderfully made show again.
Ahsoka at 00:24
THIS IS THE WAY
There were some new scenes there
But who is sasha banks playing and is she a big role, she doesn't look like sabine but maybe, I hope she's a force user/force sensitive and maybe she feels the child in the force 🤔
Wonder if they did that Star Wars reference in the boys because of the actor of Stan Edgar in the mandolran
This is the way
Who’s here before trending
Baby Yoda's ears flapping in the wind 😆
A série é tão boa que mesmo sem falar  inglês eu tô aqui vendo esse trailer kk🇧🇷
Here before 10k likes
Cannot wait for this!
He got the jet pack!!!
SULLUST????
This is the way
Everyone excited for the new episodes not realizing the main characters gonna come out unaffected lol I'm still in tho
That’s much more of a trailer
Can’t wait mando
Here before this becomes super popular and goes on the trending list ;). Also, why did the quality/resolution just drop out of nowhere at 0:19?
This is the way
I’m very excited
"This is where the fun begins"
I'm too hyped for this
Great series 🔥
Super excited!!! This is the way🔥💯
Oh yeahhhhh let's goooooo!!! I can't wait
Is that Sullust
nice
I have a very good feeling about this
This is:  ☐ where the fun begins  ☑ the way
So excited to see how this builds into the sequels!
thank you Star Wars, very cool
Where is Ahsoka? Is she safe? Is she alright?
And it would be cool to see Mando team up with some Jedi. They don’t need to be enemies, they just gotta share a drink and share war stories.
Newbies: why does he have a black lightsaber?   People who watched clone wars: sit down and let me tell you a great story!
this made my sisters day (and mine)
I will be laughing when people cry that Ahsoka was not in season 2 haha
YES, The Chi- I mean The Mandalorian is back!
This TV spot is so good, it makes me reply to my own comment!
i can't wait
Why are we here
This is wonderful! Disney (and Lucasfilm) keep it up!
OH MY GOD THE SHOT OF THE TIES LIFTING OFF WITH THE LAVASDHFUWJUH
*T H I S  I S  T H E  W A Y*
This is the way!
This is the way.
0:25 wait a second is that mustafar?
lessgooo
Why did 4 people dislike?
Just inject this show into my veins.
Got some stopmotion work to do now
Va estar  cabron
"You have something I want" is a strange way of saying *"is for me"*
Can we get more story driven episodes rather than the filler episodes we got last season.
This is where the fun begins
They are really hiding the scenes with Tatoonine and the ice planet....... wonder why?
I am so hyped!!!
This is the way..
Who got hyped as soon as they heard Moff Gideon?!?
This is the Way
This is the way.
Yayyyyy
HYPEE!!!!!
Hello there
This is the way, and hello there
Where's Ahsoka!?!?!?!?!
Trailers are so deceiving...
Ok
This is the way.
When a TV series is better than the new trilogy.. 😂😂😂😂
Bro I thought it was gonna have way more new things can’t wait for the series they better put a new two min trailer soon
Can't wait for season 2 on Oct. 30. Star Wars Fans Rejoice! "'I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in happiness  and were suddenly satisfied."
i've watched this 10 times now and it gets better every time
Yess! Can't wait!
HYYYPPPEEE
Haha AWESOME!! 👍 😂     Still no sign of Boba Fett, Sabine or Ezra, or Rex or any of the other supposed rumored characters lol and ESPECIALLY no Rosario Dawson trying to look like Ahsoka!  I couldn't BE more HYPED!!!   (Bo Katan would be great, but ONLY if she's portrayed by Katee Sackhoff. Of course. 👍😇)
JETPACK!
16 more days can’t wait!!!!
Every like= one stormtrooper hitting a blaster shot
Cara in fighting mode is the best Cara. 🙌🏼
There’s only 2000 likes on here lol I guess I’m early...

And where's Ashoka Tano.
I hope the issues with the actor guy are worked out. If not, can't say he isn't easy to replace though.
This is the way...
so this is how Star Wars begins again... to thunderous applause 👏
Yeah? Good.
Well hello there
This just appeared out of nowhere so um...Uh....
The Mandalorian: A child Without Home
Waiting for Ahsoka😭
WHERE IS SHE?!?!
YAYYY I CAN’T WAITT!!!

I’m early. What do I do?
(Gasps)aooh?
Hell yeah
If boba is going to be in this season, he better do something cool! He has been mistreated for to long!
This is the way
Watching a video two minutes after it was released is a complicated profession, don't you agree?
Me: You have something I want. It will be mine!   Disney: by that do you mean the Mandalorian?  Me: this is the way!!!!!!!!!!
Still early comments haven't ripened yet
SECOND TRAILER WOOOOOO wait wut
Show us bobaaaaaa
Why did him flying away from the stormtroopers over lava give me chills?
This is the Way!
0:30 Holy sht it's Ahsoka Tano
Wow I'm so stoked !

Mustafar?
