Tell me the hot goss 🤭 yes I’m trying to make hot goss a thing hahahahah   LOVE U
I love your videos so much!!❤❤
Literally my first thought was why didnt you just paint it red in the first place?
THE RED IS STUNNNNNNING living my dream
2:48 ok I wanna marry that lovely man, he was adorable
I luv the red barn❤
“I’m a bitch that likes to be vertical”*motions horizontally* girl I love you 😂❤️
How classic a red barn i love it!!
Just casually rewatching and that last quote has cracked me open... having a sad day, someone I was crushing on who was flirting with me is taken so now I'm gaslit and confused and sad. Feeling so unworthy since I always get hit on by unavailable guys and idk why, and it's hard to move on... but I will try. <3
oops I said what I said🤐
I know this video was posted 5 months ago but, the red you picked is PERFECT.
Thank you. 21:13 ❤
LOVE it
Morgan, you said a lot of things in your closing that were true. But you told one lie- and that is that you don’t deserve the good things that are happening to you.  That couldn’t be further from the truth. You DO deserve goodness and progress and happiness.
Morgan now you have to buy& read Big Red Barn to Jet & Max ❤🐄🐓🐖
❤❤❤
So haqppy for you Love you and your Family  Beautiful Love the  Red
If you want to add another Maddie to your collection lol I’m available 😂
Every time I find a new channel and binge watch it, there comes a point where I find out the person is neurodivergent as well. Just the way you talk and cut the video is so comfortable and easy to follow on.
The sweetest barn re built& painted by the sweetest crew ❤
Girl you got me 😢
I think you meant you like to be horizontal😂 6:41 but me too. 😂
The difference is that hardworking and family men aren’t online making podcast. Online men trash, irl men are good
ITS TAMALE SEASON LETS GO
"vertical" - moves hand horizontally hahahaa
Really appreciate the words of wisdom. That resonates so hard with me ❤
I'm so happy for you Morgan. You are healing and changing in the monst beautiful and natural way ❤ you inspire me to do the same!
can the barn pls be named clifford?
"How many times do you drive through Kansas and see a red barn?"  Me: Yes. 😂😂😂
I fucking love you dude. You are seen. I really enjoy your sweet heart and  honest intentions. I resonate with you and your depth. Thank you for continuing to be vulnerable. Let’s stay blessed🤞🏼
Giant chess pieces would look dope as decor in the checker room
i would've loved to see a pink barn :) but the red is gonna look so crisp against the snow 😫😫😫😫
The last part of your video... after The End, that you read from your IG comments or dm or whatever was inspiring and hit home. Thank you for sharing your struggles, pain happiness etc. bc like you said its nice to know youre not alone and not the only one feeling what we're feeling. Love YOU so much! Congrats on getti g closer to one of your dreams coming to. ❤
I love over sharing. Also, we need men!! There are plenty good ones🥲
Aunty Morgan’s house is going the be THE house to hang out at.
I really needed to hear the words towards the end of this video. Thank you for sharing ❤️
the difference between how your mom acts when she’s in your videos vs how she acts when she’s in rylands videos is so relatable lmaooo why do moms always treat their sons better than their daughters 😭 anyways this was brought to you by the Dads Rule Club (i am a daughter with a mom who likes my brothers more lol)
I’m so sad to see the white covered 😢
Morgan you are beautiful 🖤
LOL morgan 'im a bitch that likes to be vertical!!' (motions horizontal) HAHAH ❤😂
THAT BARN LOOKS SO GOOD OMG
Girl you better get that spider out of there, she is HUGE. What if she’s pregnant 😭
Thank you, Morgan, for sharing your thoughts at the end. You help so much when you don't know that you are. I apppreciate that. dg
The red barn is just beautiful. I love being apart of this journey😍 your videos always make my day🎉
I love the talk sessions 🩷 today was one of those days I needed it 🥺 love you forever Morgan
They’re so cute for bringing food & sharing🥹
The paint job on the barn really made it pop✨
Every barn in Ohio.
💖 The barn.  Your pick of this colour red is gorgeous!  It's perfect. 🙂
Men didn't save you, your fam SHOULD be there for you, and then you PAID people to do their job. The fact that they're nice is a bonus.
omg am i the only one that thinks the barn was beautiful white?! 😭
I don’t comment all that often but I have to say I have loved watching your journey so far with the house and barn! You’ve been super strong throughout everything. Keep making awesome content
The barn looks SOO good!
You went a did what girls do ~ changed your mind for the 12th time lol 1:01
I'm proud of you bring proud and happy
Love you Morgan. I'm loving seeing you come into your own. Stay strong and keep being you and growing as a person each day ! Blessing to you
Girl how tf is this home still being built? It’s been 75 years
I get what you're saying at the end. It's comforting to know you aren't the only one feeling how you feel or going thru what you are going thru. Therapy taught me that. I always felt so alone in my feelings. But I'm not alone.
Yes girl tamales are the best
Ok but we need to know where the sunglasses are from
I'm so happy for you that things are finally going good in your life. You deserve it!!!!❤ Sending you lots of love from Ontario Canada.
Barn turned out in a word..... gorgeous 😍
Love it
Love this can’t wait for the next one ❤❤❤
Watching this while cooking pasta for dinner… It’s like it was meant to be. Lol
No Halloween videos , big disappointment…
I wanna be like Morgan when I grow up! Btw I'm 34 lol
IVE MISSED MORGAN
Someone that has better painting skills then me needs to paint 23:46-23:47. Shes gorgeous and the background 😍
This video gives me hope that all the hardships and work I’ve been putting in my life to progress, get through school, get the house, help my family, create generational wealth and feel a sense of accomplishment and happiness.. will one day happen. So happy for you !! Your glowing ❤
loved the painters 🥰 ps. that was  pan dulce 😂
Living your life "horizontal" and watching t.v. etc. sounds great when it is done by choice... but when you lose your health and it's now forced on you... and you don't have the option to live life "vertical" anymore... it's really not fun or "the easier choice".
I been here living for this whole journey hoping a good ending for you and this shit just makes my heart so happy, I’m so happy for dude 🎉❤ I would love to start a philanthropy organization with you  one day 🥲 you’d get me
Ahhh love seeing you taking on that hill! You are a beautiful hot mess of inspiration good vibes and comfort 😅 so relatable ✨️ thank you for continuing to share your journey! The barn looks soo good! ❤  P.s. have you considered getting a llama since you've met Ryan's llamammas?
Red barns are so tacky and outplayed 😩 The white barn with the black accents were so classy and really made the BARn the focus. Now it could be someone's fuking tool shed, idk, who cares.  It will also make it more of a target for theft, so have Shane help you with setting up a full Jeffree Starr approved security system, miss thing. Tools and farming equipment are where the real money is at 🤑🤑🤑
I love when your mom videos, it reminds me of my old childhood family videos with her prompting you and moving items around all while holding the camera. The shaking and random zooming just adds to the amazing value 😂
Haven’t watched you in years but just woke up from a dream where you had brought a property, had quads- 3 girls, 1 boy.   Started fixing up the house that also had stables attached. With a contractor your planning out where everything will be going.   Soo when I went to see what you have been up to and find you with a barn and fixing it up.    Just crazy
Amazing Morgan, I needed to hear that. I think we feel like everyone sees our pain and hurt. But they dont. We are women at a time when there is way to much judgement from people we dont even know. So live your best life ,stand-in the light and love you're self . Take care.Your barn looks amazing. ❤🙏🙌
I don't wanna be a spiderrrrr
🎃🎃🎃🎃
Still wish you just left the barn black and white. Painting your barn red is so dumb and boring.
This video is probably my favourite that she’s made.  I love how open she is about her feelings, about her “failures”, about her highs!  It makes me feel less alone in this world.
So happy to see that the project is almost complete!
I don't even know if you believe in God. But I just felt like you could use some prayer. You have gone through so much. I love you and God loves you. You are such a light to so many people. People go through a lot of crap and they just don't talk about it. We pretend it's all good, but it's not. That's why we need each other!! 😭😭😭
The red barb is such a power move. I love it!
Morgan, I think you meant horizontal, not vertical! 😂😂😂 I love you
Cannot wait to watch you decorate !!
I’m also a bitch that likes to be vertical 😅
I love you morgan but let’s go to target, let’s go to Starbucks, TJ Maxx would be fun anything but house! ❤
Yessss. We need manly men in our lives. Love it.
Damn Morgan looks so freaking BEAUTIFUL my Goodness!!!! she’s stunning
You are beautiful Morgan. You are strong! You are growing!! I’m excited for you. Everything is coming together the way it was supposed to. Sending lots of love. ♥️
The red is timeless for sure, but I am kinda sad to see the white go
Morgan! You're a beautiful soul! You've got this and we are all loving the journey you're on! Also hot goss...lol love it❤❤❤❤
you are wiser for sharing things after the fact. its better for your mental health too
2:45 the rizz got me giggling 😂
Morgan in case someone haven't mentioned this already 'Al dente' is something almost cooked and firm to the bite, contrary to your hot goss analogy💀
it looks so good, Morgan! happy for & proud of you. I enjoy watching all of your house journey videos. ❤
The barn looks absolutely gorgeous!!! Such a perfect shade of red!! 😍💕
We need more men like your contractors in the world. ❤ they're a crucial part of society!
Thank you for the warning. Even with it, I had a visceral response to seeing that spider.
Wow. I love this video. All your videos are amazing. But the editing and pace is especially good in this one. I miss you! I want to see the barn! This is so exciting. Love you Morgan! ☺️❤️
Morgan is looking hotter by the day
crying 10am on a monday
I am a bitch that likes to be vertical as well
What ever happened with Angie? Did she follow you?
I don't know what's cuter, Morgan or the barn?!  Awwww, you are Morgan! All the very best to you! ❤😊❤
only thing I ask is that you slow down😭 when you insert the pics I always miss them and have to go back I love looking at the polaroids. Also side note, I loved the ending you are more than deserving you are more than what you have been through. Always hoping for better days for you and anyone going through something. Love ya morgs!!!
You do deserve this!
“I’m a bitch that likes to be vertical” *proceeds to show what horizontal is*😂❤️
I love men too! I dont understand the manhating that goes on lol
1. Love the red 2. 70% Swiss coffee the way 2 go
Once again Bryan coming through with amazing energy and enthusiasm
Girl 😂 My mom fed me Ego waffles and peanut butter too! 😂😂 I had to edit to come back and say i used to love the smell of Cement glue too!! Might explain alot about my brain now a days 😆
Honestly so invested in the success of this project! ❤🎉
I had no idea she went through a lawsuit. Did she sue the old construction crew that f$%ked her over?
I work full time and struggle with life so sometimes keeping up with others is a little hard but could someone please fill me in on this lawsuit Morgan is mentioning? T.I.a. 🙏💙
6:30 Says “vertical” with conviction, while gesturing horizontally 😂
can't wait to see when the house is ready, it's going to be amazing! I'm so jelly ..
Was this your first time trying tamales? If so, I would've thought you tried them already because I assume your ex is Hispanic. 🤔
I think your thinking of the word grateful, evolving successfully! So happy for you!
I was thinking we were going to see the inside too since the title says 'tour' I'll keep watching for that cause I am excited to see it finished.
Imagining you with dark hair and I think you could totally pull it off
That barn is going to a land mark in locals giving directions, for years to come. 😂❤
Poor Shirley lol
So what was the hot gos? The lawsuit? It yes, what was it about, without too many details of course?
I think you meant horizontal! But I love this for you! Good choice with the red!!
As a woman of the same age, your hot take on men def needs to be integrated more in society 🔥 plenty of good helpful men out there not trying to walk all over women 🎉  And THE END OMG 😭 ❤
Morgan, can you PLEASE tell me where you got your sunglasses from. The ones you wear specifically at 20:34. I need them.
11:09 oh… not cinnamon bread-😀
I didn’t know if the red was it BUT IT IS IT! I’m in love
Morgan I love yiu
💖💖💖
Wait til you do trim..it was better than giving birth and about as expensive as a child’s college education ..I’m on the same journey..but I’m a bit ahead of you .But I aced the septic for last so I’m not able to experience the fruits of my labors ..literally.. no running water yet or toilet flushing!! And the whole damn interior is done ..Arghhhhhhhh feel my pain
Little did Morgan know that she makes thumbnails which are basically the same thing as a photo 😂
Morgan i think that you are GLOWING, in my opinion this is the best you have looked ever, not only physically but also mentally I’m really proud of you, you look beautiful girl! ❤❤❤❤
wow this barn is gorgeous you did an amazing job
Gray mist with white trim! ❤
On 4:03 girl u are so beautiful I don’t get how u single
Are your teeth real???
"when did men get so involved in my life" when you literally paid them to be 😭
@6:31 Vertical is up and down horizontal is side to side lol but we get ya 😂
Why did I think the barn was supposed to be white!!?? Lol
Awesome video! I was thinking about it, and searching for a costume but I have no idea. My almost 11 year old is being a train conductor. He's obsessed with trains. Happy Halloween, Garrett. 🎃
Vertical! (As she draws a horizontal line talking about how laying down is easier) 😂😂😂
The ending was so moving 😢 That was beautifully written and so relatable.
Thank you for this Morgan. I haven't been feeling myself lately, feels like I am in a burn out phase of my life rn, but I thank for this vlog upload. Feels like I have a big sister comforting me. Please upload more soon hehe. Cheers to this new chapter in your life❤
Idc what anyone says… men are necessary 😂 they do things I don’t wanna do
Can I get a hello or anything I love your videos ❤️
The guys put in the blood and sweat but u definitely put in the tears 😂
After you finish renovating the house and the barn, you should start a series of interior designs and most importantly a series of landscaping and outdoor living.
It makes me so happy to see you thrive Morgan! Congrats on the "new" barn! <3 <3
girlll idt you’ll ever be content
Morgan I'd love to see a what I eat in a day or week video from you!! <3
It was not ever used as a barn, it was used to house an entire mini train and many many tools for an incredibly amazing family. Despite you and your family continuing to bad mouth then AFTER you said how sweet my Gram was.
I LOVE the red barn! Great choice Morgan!!
Morgan you are so cute, you always talk in 3s! Around 12:00:  un-comfortable, un-sure, & un-willing, followed by 3 flippy peace signs, then the drywall has been drywalled, texture has been textured, drying has been dried...lol! :)
Girl we have seen the unfinished barn so many times, this isn't a tour. Show us when you're finished.
Love Morgan but sometimes she speaks in repeated analogies to the point I am so confused as to what she was supposed to say / was trying to get at..  Morgan I love knowing about you journeys but could you spit it out and then explain instead of explaining what we have no idea you are talking about?
Crustic red looks great! Now if you only had enough paint left over from the spill fest that occured...
6:29 did you mean horizontal?
I love your vlogs recently more than ever! They are so cozy, slow, peaceful, just perfect really. I love the red barn as well, can't wait for the walls inside to be pianted already. And yes, you CAN move on Morgan, love
LOVE the red barn and the house & all is really coming together & looking GREAT! :) I LOVE You & your video's but wish there were MORE! LOL Keep up the good work! I'm sure you must be getting excited for your actual move in day!! Love the journey as hard/long as it has been. Not many women can say they have done what you have been doing! SO HAPPY FOR YOU!  :)  <3
I liked the barn better white
The barn and the leaves changing oh my 😍😍
Beautiful Morgan...love you!!
Morgan, please look up Desiderata, it's a poem I printed out in some of my hard times and read daily. ♥
Move on but be accountable of your actions, what you did and who you chose. Move on by being responsable and IMPROVING not making the same mistakes
You should make a tiktok account of loving men. Women are lost- hating men and blaming men in their own choices and misery!   You should share this message. When someone attacks you- you want female or male police? When you are stuck somewhere and need someone to carry you- you want male firefighter or female?? And in general- who actually is ready to help you with actual problems? MEN!  MEN DO IT!  I have HUGE respect for men. They deserve it. WOmen need to start earning respect because right now- it aint shit!
Country music in the background, she’s going back to her roots  LA is leaving her blood like a Toxin
Dude. You went HARD with the end. From one dark and twisty girl to another, thank you.
Those trees are so pretty! Love this!
You definitely deserve this, Morgan. You deserve ALL THE GOOD THINGS! (now that you have found a great team of contractors I hope you do more project managing with your team of RELIABLE MEN)
Never mind Better Heath for therapy I need a Morgan friend in my life!! You're such a beautiful soul ❤
I respect Morgan in the aspect that I can admire men for doing hard Jobs like good job 😄 you did that now next
That is a ban of gorgeous perfection!  And, thank you so much for sharing that ending. There are so many of us that feel the same and that needed to hear it❤️
Oh my god, you look so beautiful. Take lots of pictures! Be proud. You look amazing.
Clifford the big red barn, I’m obsessed!
You do deserve this Morgan.  Get you some!!!
❤
Morgan, I’m usually a silent follower, I watch videos and never comment much. Today your video came up on my feed and I put it on as background noise while I got ready for work. Today is my 28th birthday, I got married about a week ago and my mom suddenly passed away a week before my wedding; the poem that  you read at the end of the video really made a difference in my day. Today is my first birthday without my mom who was my best friend in the whole world and I’ve never felt pain this deep before. Thank you for reading that, thank you so much. I hope you see this and know that you lightened up my day just a little ❤️
Love the red barn!!!!  I love the painters bringing tamales and pan dulce for every one lol
HIS LIL DANCE
I’m so happy for you Morgan !!! ❤❤❤
Morgan it's beautiful! Relish in the victory and beauty ❤
Looks great👍
usually i watch through every ad because i want creators to get that coin, and im a big supporter of going to therapy. but something about better help gives me bad vibes and i always skip the ads and despite knowing its not my place, i with creators would stop endorsing the platform. maybe i just need to do more research but for now, i felt like i should share incase anyone else has thoughts
Hot goss = So Fetch! Hee Hee! Just kidding!! Morgan, you deserve to be joyful and accepting of all the love we give back to you! The red barn is EPIC!!
Morgan, you and the barn are beautiful 🤩 ❤
morgan! love these videos. you should make a scrapbook with the polaroids and have the guys who helped you put their handprints in and write you messages or an album “hands that built this home” and just the hands with their message ❤❤❤❤would be a lovely memory for them and you
Morgan you need to listen to “Hills and Valleys” by Tauren Wells 🙌🏻
Horizontal...
us hispanos love to share :) so sweet of the painters to share their breakfast
I love the barn Morgan!!! Really gorgeous!
“I am a bitch that likes to be vertical” YES SIS I AM SHE, SHE IS ME
The cinnamon bread is called, pan de dulce aka sweet bread.
A man also messed it up. 😂 The key word is the right men.
So proud of you Morgan! Always feel free to share your thoughts and feelings. The barn colour is perfect!! We love yah♥️
Rustic red is it, sis 🤌🏼
love what you said about the guys - so true especially in today’s society. Good people are everywhere :) love your videos Morgan!
The “I hate men” thing is valid. I’m 32 and feel the same but actually enjoy being around men. It’s because they’re different when they’re romantically involved with a woman
Thank you for sharing that poem, it was so beautiful and very relatable probably to many people. I loved it and will be sharing it.
I was in Denver over the weekend, loved it!!!
LOVING the editing style of your videos lately Morgan!!
1:04 “I went and did the thing that us girls do” 😂😂😅 I feel EXPOSED
Holy cow the lighting at 3:50 …omg 😍
this was a video I didnt think I needed! as someone REALLY struggling that last part of this video really made me ugly cry so thank you for adding those words even if its from another! I hope things turn around you are beautiful and wonderful and deserve it all!
I’m so happy that things are finally falling into place for you!
We don’t deserve you Morgan. Thank you for being you, I hope to shine half as bright as you one day ❤️
Love you Morgan!!!! Your videos make me so happy!
Not the painter being obsessed with Morgan ❤😂 love it !!
Your barn is absolutely gorgeous.  I always loved picking colors & other house things. I have a friend who was building a house & I'd come home & find big manilla envelopes by my door with samples of things for me to weigh in on. Lol.
Your red barn is very cute. And joy looks good on you. xox
I think you mean you like to be horizontal 😂😂😂
love you Morgan and all the hot goss <3
The barn looks insanely good! So beautiful. ❤
am i hearing a red barn revival??
I’m genuinely curious how you’re affording this. I get it’s not our business but as a 25 year old with great credit, who can’t get financed for any type of loan…. How are you literally building your dream home?
i genually love morgan and i love the fact that she got a lil taste of the mexican tradition😭. as a mexican i feel like my worlds have collided ☝🏻 specially with the pan dulce😋 hope you like it morgan !
I'm proud of you.
Thank you for reading the poem. I am bawling. You are amazing ❤
May this New milestone bring you much sense of accomplishment, fulfillment, as well as catapult you into new productive and hope filled future… with more happiness, peace and love than your heart can contain! Thanks for the reading… very inspiring, even for this chronically  nearly drowning, middle aged optimist!
We love MEN, we hate BOYS
Uhmmm.. That's not how al dente works😅
Can’t wait to see everything you do to this house 🏡
Your house is looking so beautiful, I'm so glad these men came into your life and gave you new hope.
Morgan. I love you. But as someone who is not wealthy, can't afford to remodeled a home, can barely afford to just pay my bills or struggles to find food.. I can't watch these videos right now.
I love seeing you feel happy redeemed refreshed and deserving! ❤ you!
You couldn’t have painted it any other color and it have fit so well. It looks absolutely amazing and I believe the secret beauty is going to be behind those gorgeous red walls. The peaceful white walls and trimmed in dark beams is the best compliment yet contrast.
Morgan listen to the reggae song called hills & values by Buju banton 😂😂it’s a vibe
You need to release a lippy: Boss Barn Red
can we talk about how gorgeous morgan is?? stunning blonde beauty fo real. your beauty glows from the inside out. never change - and never shut up;)
So cool Morgan! ❤❤
Hmmmm. You opened your eyes to the real world. And all the hate in socisl media. I would rather hang with all guys. Way less drama and emotions. Much more laid back
Fellow Morgan here!   When I was deciding on an interior color we chose 3 creams just like you did. We painted paper just like you did but we only labeled the back. We hung each one in each room, in the morning, noon and night. We all voted A, B or C. But changed it so only one person recorded the results and put it to a vote. You be surprised how popular one color actually becomes, and we love it!  Sending love ❤️
Thank you for the take away
I love the red barn.  Most important you survived!❤😂
I love seeing you upload so often and it’s nice seeing you happy! I look forward to your videos and I love your over sharing because I do the same.. 😂
Damn!!! This vlog hit different this time! 😭😭 i am so happy for you and all you have done !! I been and i am in that black hole and feel you girl is hard! But we can move, of course que can! We got this ! 🎉❤
crying at 10 pm on a wednesday. that was beautiful
vertical ↔️
I think you mean that you like being horizontal! Not vertical haha
@MORGAN , LOVE THE COLOR OF THE BARN💯💯💯💯💯
*I hope you put some colour into the house, so it feels warm*
Did she mean horizontal tho?
[@16:05] killed me 😂 I love this series so much! It's inspired me the last 2 years while we build and develop on our own land ❤
The barn looks gorg. The shot with the white fence line in there too 👌🏼😍
I hardly ever comment, but you really got me at the end there 🥲 I legit cried with you. Apparently I really needed to hear all that and I appreciate you not second guessing yourself and sharing it with us :) Also, I’m really not just saying this but you are super photogenic-remember we’re usually our own worst critics. What if we loved ourselves with the kind of love talked about in the poem you read? That’s going to be my renewed goal, thank you for the reminder ❤
What is the song playing over the painting day 2 segment?
I'm sorry but you annouy me. Your so spoiled and have nothing to worry about....other then picking what color RED you want to choose for your barn. I'm not in a good mood. So I'm done. Moving ON NOW. BYE.
Son conchas! O cemitas! Depends where your from. Lol not cinnamon bread. Shell bread.
Thats the prettiest barn I've ever seen!!
I Love what you read 😭😭😭💖
who you vote for?
yeah you need more than a therapist. get help
Morgan if you didn't put at least 4 gorgeous big monsteras in your gigantic living room windows I would call the 👮🏻‍♂️. I swear it would be criminal to have this enormous windows with so much sunlight to not have some type off greenery in them. I know it would take time before it's all done but just think about it 😄😄😄 love you
Quick thing about the spider. I know we only saw it on the screen for like half a second but I think it's a false widow. They are less shiny and they have dimples in their abdomen but black widows are completely smooth and shiny. She also mentioned the spider in a previous video and was saying she thought it was pregnant, but spiders don't really get pregnant lol
Wait. You have an HOA?
As a fellow Mexican/ Latina I promise you we love sharing our food 🥰
it's funny the end of the video i would normally be like ok lame, but i actually really needed to hear that today 😢
Wait but what about those pink Christmas lights you wanted to hang on the barn? It won’t go with the red 😩😩😩😩
The red is a great red. like its RED but not a loud bright red.  Also, if you havent already, even though they all look very similar on camera, the swiss coffee seemed warmer and will work with the wood and make it not feel like a glue pot as you described it XD
The ending was healing for me thank you❤
Thank you for being you! You make me feel seen. ♥️
Omg Morgan you are a hell of woman what you been through and conquered. Have more faith in yourself.  You give women hope. We can do it.  Thanks so much.  I pray that you find that Prince Charming you so deserve.  Don’t understand why men don’t see the beautiful heart and kindness inside and out.  Sending hugs
Hey, just a helpful remodeling tip (currently doing my kitchen)!  You can buy peel and stick paint samples online :-)
I know it feels like a never ending project but you're gonna be so sad when it's all over and all these amazing people you see everyday, who have supported you through this will have to move on. Even if you still remain in contact you will miss these days. So don't think of it as a never ending project, enjoy this time because it will creep up on you and then it's over.
cuuute
Yep the barn looks freaking awesome!
I love you girl keep your head up 🥰🙏🏽💃🏻
Now I want an update house tour with walls and all.
Morgan I need the  jeans you are wearing when you are reporting by the fence wearing a cowboy hat! Send me a link lol
Paint the Barn Red *Doja Voice*
Morgan the red barn is so cute and classic!! I’m so glad you went with it!! 😍
Red is it girl!  Looks so gooood
Now we just need to get this girl some chickens for that coop🤪 and finish the coop? Love it all morgan!!!
Morgan you look so good now! You're glowing!! You can see that you are doing so much better and that makes me so happy and so proud ;__;
The barn looks amazing, and it’s so nice seeing it with some fall foliage and the gate 🤎
Thank you for reading the comment ❤️
Morgan just know you are doing everything you can to be the best you you can be! take a deep breath, with every hill and valley you're coming closer to where you are meant to be <3 i love you and am so proud of you for conquering everything you've been through
Morgan you are looking amazing and you seem so happy lately I love it keep doing whatever your doing girl, it looks good on you. Love it 🥰
Do a shot every time she says literally! Olivia will get you there. 😂Love you Morgan No hate!!!!!
Ok but is the painter man married or should he just ask Morgan already because y’all 👀👀👀😭
I watch every week just in hopes there may be a relationship announcement
the men helping to complete that house are under the “not all men” category
Okay, here we are trending 👏
so damn happy for this guhrl  Karma is her boyfriend
Morgan, do you like the platform uggs?! I want them so bad but I’m worried they aren’t comfortable. I would LOVE your thoughts 😘💖
This was a very heartfelt video. I loved every part of it and the end made me cry. But i need to know, Morgan did u get ur chick fil a and how long was the line ? 🤔😂😂
Girl you’re so gorgeous you got that ✨natural✨beauty
Now you need a barn quilt! 😃
Oliviaaaaa! :D
Morgan, vertical is up and down. Horizontal is sideways, like the horizon.
Love the poem love your content 🧡🎃🍂🍁
Red > white
Vertical😂😂😂
Morgan you are such a light. I’m so glad you are sharing your life with us! I truly feel like you’re a friend and am so happy that you are in a better headspace for yourself.
Morgan and her obsession with everything related to glue 🤣🤣
ugh i liked the black& white🥺 red feels like it’s a barn for animals. NOt a dream house barn🥺
Women/people don’t hate men because it’s “trendy” or fun. It’s because of traumatic experiences, what men are capable of and all kinds of situations and everything we’ve gone through because of men. Personally I don’t hate all men but I don’t trust men as easily. always have and always will keep my guard up against men
You look amazing and so does that beautiful barn. ❤ so happy for you.
Your mom lmao  “I hope we didn’t get in your way 😬”
I know the feeling when any little thing goes right it feels so weird and uncomfortable because things have been going wrong for so long 💖
waw I think I need the august 1 clip saved as my alarm
awwee im so happy for you and how far your home has come! You look stunning by the way! ❤️
As long as I’ve been following your journey w the barn from purchase until now I thought the barn WAS your house but just realized there’s a while separate house 🤦‍♀️.  It’s going to be soooo well worth it when this is all over. Can’t wait for the peace and quiet you will find when there’s no more construction!!
I liked the barn white but the red just fits and feels right! I pray nothing steps in the way of your hike to the top of your mountain of happiness! I’m also so happy that your journey has restored your faith in good men because there are still some out there!🥰
also omg WHO MAKES AN F BY MAKING AN r FIRST AND ADDING AN EXTRA LINE?!
I need literally every sweater from this video. Especially the one the 6:36 clip 😭❤️
this is amazing…the barn, the tamales, the moment, the movement. 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
I don’t know if anyone else is thinking this but I love when she keeps rambling at the end
You mixing up being vertical vs horizontal is the best LOL my mom always says "Well, im off to do my favourite thing... laying horizontally with a bag of Lays" hahaha
Morgan getting vertical and horizontal mixed up in the most confident way
horizontal*😂🫶🏼
You’re like a sister I couldn’t be more proud of! Dont ever give up on anything you’re doing (unless it’s not good for you). You are always amazing and there are plenty of us that will be here along the way! ❤💕
But also that construction 🏗️ crew you hired are what good men look like.
So happy you are verge of moving in your house🎉
So proud of who you are becoming! From a mom.
your house is coming together SO well
better help is a scam company btw!
Omg the way your parents blocked the shot 😂. That sums up all parents
Idt you realize how pretty you look in the video 😍
Wow!! All of it is absolutely gorgeous!
Morgan, this is so amazing. Everything looks amazing and you are glowing. Thank you for allowing us to go along with you on your journey. Valleys and hills!
They gave you tamales and pan dulce 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💕💕💕💕🥹
I loooove how you edit your videos with all the Polaroid pictures 🤍
The barn looks awesome! ❤
Girl! I love seeing you this excited and happy. I loved to see the videos you put in there from yourself from a while ago. You look so happy, radiant and mature. I normally never comment on videos, I rarely do. But I just felt so much happiness and feel so proud of you. We love seeing you like this babe!
The intro was giving “in the last episode of-“ 😂
I rewatch your videos all the time. You’re my favorite Morgan!
I am so happy for you. ❤
Too much energy wasted on a red barn 😂
I love it❤❤❤
it's sooooo beautiful!!
The barn looks sooo beautiful... little by little it's coming along 😊
Do you what is so funny… everytime I see your thumbnail (basically a photo) I think omg she is so gorgeous … I wish I looked like her 😂 . Please post photos Morgan!!!!!
Morgan, the barn looks fabulous!! Brilliant job, the house is really moving along now, so exciting! Love you, Px
i love the way you put polaroid picures as  a transitions for your videos... its such a cool morgan thing!! and thats the hot goss
❤
The barn looks amazing! Literally goals with your house and land🤍
I think you are gorgeous and you take great pictures.
“I love having life long dreams that I thought of last week.” She’s so real for that.
When she said I’m a bitch that likes being vertical.. but she’s talking about laying down 🤣🤣
BUENO!!
Thank you so much for sharing that beautiful message at the end. You may not have been the writer, but you got it out to more people who needed it <3
I love the expression “tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it’. ….. today didn’t work, let’s try again tomorrow. I guess if everything was perfect you wouldn’t learn, grow and achieve. Remember your life is what U make of it❤
OMG! The barn is so pretty.
The workers are very kind for sharing their food and cultural. As a hispanic we tend to in addition to pay we provide meals to our workers. Them providing you homemade meals just shows how invested they are in their work and team. You have so much support to help you heal.
Love the red barn ❤ and I had hardest time finding a white also I did 30 samples I love how guys saved u
morgannnnn. i think youre a real life angel!! I have the worst 2 years and in the past 3 days ive accepted that ive hit rock bottom and its where i belong. but this vid and all the things youve shared in it, i feel like its shun a light on where im at and given me hella hope. Thanks morgan you angel <3
it looks amazing! especially with the trees turning all these autumn colours. The shot with the sun coming through made me want to have my own red barn.
Morgan! Vertical is upright. You meant horizontal... :) <3
I truly ENJOY your vlogs....your so REAL..and it's a breath of fresh air......LOVE YOU MORGAN!!
*As much as I liked the black and white I like the red more. looks amazing*
It looks so great Morgan! 🤩👏
The red barn is a symbol, you are on the right path. It is beautiful, just like you... revitalized, revamped,  renewed! It's all coming together! We love you, too, Morgan!
The barn looks so beautiful! You totally picked the perfect red and I love the white trim with it.  Authentic, homemade tamales are epic! Haven't had one in years and years, but I still remember how great they were.
It's Showtime!
I’m so sorry but I hate that you called conchas … cinnamon bread wtf 😭
Humble queen
It's giving Doja Cat!! Paint the BARN red!
I could absolutely see you with a tradie!! Do it! I don’t think it is not easier to ‘lay in bed’ all day, as a social worker I know how hard it is for people to do society at all! But I understand where you’re coming from and I don’t think this is what you meant.  ❤ You are amazing, and deserving of all the things!! Life has its ebbs and flows- it’s riding the wave. It can be hard, but you have a lot of love behind you!!
girl you are stunning and glowing and so freaking funny!!
GO MORGAN!! 💖
Any chance you want to take in a 27 year old lady? She’s fully domesticated, just needs collection from Australia. She is me. Please I want to chill in your barn 😂
Morgan, I’m always so happy to see there’s a video from you, your voice, your face, your personality are just the most comforting and awesome! I wish I was your friend in real life so I could be there for you and help you whenever you needed.  I loooove your red barn! I loooove how you wore your tank top showing your scar like a warrior!  I know I’m 1 small person for the multitude that you have, but I hope you know that if you ever want to talk to someone different, that is living with cancer, and renovating a house, you can message me! 😊 Sending you all the good vibes!
Morgan, thank you for taking us along with you on this journey, even though it has had its ups and downs, and has taken way longer than you ever anticipated it to… it is finally all coming together and I am super excited and so proud of you! 💗 I definitely think that you made the right decision about the barn. It turned out stunning. 💞
❤❤❤❤❤
The way I sensed this coming in my bones❤
I’m so excited to watch your journey! This is going to be incredible. ❤
I know you’ll probably never see this, but just know I’m vicariously living through you ❤ I’ve always dreamed of having a white house and a red barn. You’re doing amazing sweetie 🎉
The barn looks great, love the colour
You mentioned the amount of guys in your life a few times in this video as well as how you were rescued by them. Honestly I think you were blessed with community that you really needed and that’s beautiful and they just happened to be guys. Ignoring the part where you pay them, the guys haven’t treated you like The Customer but basically like a cousin or a sister since the start. It’s been awesome seeing you be involved with each aspect with the guys and seeing not just how you’ve been included but supported by them and how you’ve included and supported them in return. I hope you keep finding things for them to build 😂
My Latino familia know how to do things well and quickly! And our food is just so good. Love that you appreciate it. 🥰 Barn look amazing! So fun to see it all come together! 🥳
Oh, Morgan! I'm so ecstatic for you!
Morgan you are beautiful inside and OUT! Your smile is gorgeous!! Please feel good about pictures of yourself!!!
💜💜💜💜💜💜
Morgan, i'd say Instagram photos are a fear you don't necessarily have to face. Instagram isn't the most healthy 'place' to be. Society tells us we need Instagram, but we don't. Don't worry about it
I think it’s ok to over share about something so wholesome. Love us some “toxic masculine” life savers
Omg it lookkkks awesome 👌🏻 👏🏻 beautiful majestic barn 🚜 🐖 🧱
Please tell Shane Eugenia Cooney is dying. Yes he made a lot of money off of her but Shane isn’t that evil right? He’s gonna say something to her publicly right? Oh Shane got cancelled years ago after finding out he was a terrible person? Oh he just used Eugenia Cooney to make some money and that was it.. you’re gonna burn in hell with him Morgan.
I can't believe you painted it red lol. I couldn't imagine you doing tjat. I LOVED THE WHITE
6:29 HORIZONTAL 🤭
The barn looks freakin amazing!  I love it!
Im 45 and have had things haunt me for a long time. I have made strides and then I let them go, they come back, so happy to have this reminder to keep on going, again. I built a house and it was so hard, sold it and bought a dream house, now selling again to downsize and buy the dream location. The rollercoaster really doesn't stop for some of us. No matter what age we are, there is always ups and downs. But it is an amazing time no matter what.
MORGAN, your barn looks stunning! You have the best team around you, always working hard on a dream you thought  you wouldn't see light too. Keep going at it, you can push through any obstacle! I cry each time I get notified Morgan posted a new video. Makes my day and night <3 much love
The barn is beautiful! Can’t wait to see everything completed ❤
Congratulations Morgan! You have broken through the fog of feminism! Men are great! I wouldn't want to live in this world without them.
THAT BARN LOOKS FREAKIN AMAZING!!! And Bryans reaction to it, precious. I am livin for all of it ♥️
Morgan, you are a beautiful person inside & out. I relate so much to the feelings you have, & that message you read at the end resonated so well with what I have been feeling this past week. You are inspiring me to *really* start moving forward & letting myself have what I deserve and desire. Life is beautiful. We really do need to enjoy those special moments. ❤
What is wrong with you that you're not killing the deadly spider living in the toilet what if we not gets moved to the next job site or event that someone gets bitten killed by it please kill the spider find a spider collector to come get it something
Morgan is like Snow white but with way more men 😂 . I love it
You so dam beautiful Morgan
Gurrrllllll your vlogs make me happy ❤
MORGAN WHO ARE YOU DATING
The construction guys sharing tamales with you makes my little heart happyyyy
ozempic?
this is so millennial
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Morgan is so Prettty and how are you geting so snatched ! We Must know ❤
Morgan - please remember, those men who came and “saved you” were there because YOU earned the $ to not only buy your own place but to hire that whole crew to come in and do the work. You can tell they just as we have come to root & care for you and that’s because it is really easy to do but YOU made this happen. I used to live in an old converted red barn and I loved it so this gave me all the nostalgic feels. I hope someday you give yourself more credit. All the best ✨
Not me picking my face and watching this video and you mentioned picking your pimples LMAO I was like  👀 👀
I was unsure about the red barn at first but OH MY GOD. ♥
Okay but drop that “I got a runnin tab and it’s run away” song @ 9:44 !! I’m a small town girl who’s lost her roots, so click your boots and help me out
i love our red barn🥰
It is a damn slay sis, and you deserve it.  Impeccable content. <3
I wasn’t initially sold on the red barn but it looks sooo good oh my goodness
It fills me with so much joy seeing this all come together, I can’t imagine how Morgan feels
Dude we should be friends ❤
White paint, which got its tint from white lead, was tougher to come by and more expensive than red paint, which was tinted with the much more plentiful ferrous oxide, or rust. Farmers used a combination of linseed oil and rust to protect their barn wood from decay.
In this video there is so much that can’t even be put into words of sorrow, hope and gratitude. What a journey you are on and allowing all of us go through this with you. I as well as many of us here have known such things and are cheering you on.
Your literally paying those men …. To fix it… cuz that’s their jobs….😂 but yes not all men are trash when you pay them and are a pretty blonde girl Morgan 😂✨ Charlize Theron lookin ass 🫶🏻🤣✨what’s going to in the barn ?
Any health updates 😊 sending healing light
Beautiful! Every bit  of this video and you. The red barn is stunning and the sun shining through the windows in your house.. Breathtaking, so so happy for you
Really needed the ending. Thank you <3 give yourself permission
I know it's a barn and all but why all the gross country music?  blahhh
This episode filled my cup. Thank you Morgan. Come to New Jersey my sister in trauma 💖
Morgan, where do you buy all of your hoodies/sweat shirts/sweatpants? They all look so comfy but stylish!
I look forward to ur new content!! Thank u😊❤
That's so wholesome! One thing about my people is that they always be sharing their food! such sweet human beings
Im so glad the house is finally almost done. You guys have been working so long on it. Im glad it finally all came together ❤️
Yes this red barn is actually a THING! It looks gorgeous and kind of lucky...if that makes sense.👱‍♀️🍂🕸🕷📷❤
“Embreaded”  -Morgan Adams  2023
I would so buy a place just for the barn as well. 😁
morgan you meant horizontal not vertical😭😭
Morgans era ✨️  Most looked forward to content on youtube. Thanks for continouing to share your journey with us girl! Your barn with the fall colours and the golden light looks so peaceful✨️
YES POP OFF RED BARN❤
That SPIDER , you’re so chill around it I’m so jealous lol, had to take care of one at work the other day and it was the scariest thing for me
Bryan's excitement over the red barn is so wholesome I love it
❤❤❤
Horizontal* 😅
That's not cinnamon bread... That's pan dulce.
We are all human, and we all have trials and tribulations. I do believe that things always get better if you keep trying.  You are beautiful and don't stop!!!  🥰
Thank you
She’s a healing queen. Welcome to being an adult Morgan. You deserve happiness
Congratulations on the barn house!! I love it so awesome! 🎉❤ also your looking gorgeous!!
That red barn just makes me so happy! It looks soooo amazing!
Morgen you are literally my whole life I have watched you for so so long and I have watched you rise and fall and seeing how amazing things are going for you and how genuinely happy you look makes me smile every time you post a video I save it so I can sit down I front of my tv and watch your videos thank you for all the years of love you have sent out and amazing messages that have helped me get through horrible times in my life it’s your turn now  love you girl 🤍
3:44 pic is giving the favorite niece with all the uncles during a family gathering HAHAHAHA thats so cute!
You’ve come to such a beautiful place Morgan. I am so happy for you! You deserve every ounce of joy and happiness that you are experiencing right now. ❤
Absolutely love love love the red barn! Red is awesome color I even painted my living room red!
Be honest…she’s not doing better help.  My better help therapist was peeing on the phone with me.
Glad you went with red tho it’s a classic so gorg
In the beginning of this process I weirdly thought the barn was your house lol I don’t know why I thought that but
you didn´t had to make me cry on a Tuesday at 9 pm...
Morgan, please do some research into Betterhelp, they aren't as great as they appear.
The barn looks AMAZING!
Shout out to the hardworking Latinos!
I love how excited he is about your barn! Y'all really have become a lil family 🥰
My people bringing her tamales and pan dulce ❤ you were well taken care of ❤
i can't wait tell you live in your sweet home ❤❤❤❤
Wow I really needed to hear that whole ending.
Morgan, you look absolutely gorgeous. Your happiness reflects in you physically.
I think she ment horizontal😅
Morgan, I am so happy for you and seeing your beautiful home and barn come together makes me smile!😊 Thank you for sharing your journey through these sweet, funny and heartwarming vlogs and bringing a bit of joy to my otherwise dull day☺️
SOMETIMES men actually pull through! So proud of your growth morgan! Happy the house is turning out to be everything you wanted
I love it
which video was it that she talked about the lawsuit results?
I love these guys!  They are amazing!  The red barn looks so so good!
Good for you speaking up about men lol we love men and we need men 🤍🤍  The barn is beautiful ❤
Side note but morgan you look amazing! You are beautiful inside and out ❤
Omgsh totally relate to taking pics of myself! I can’t do it and hate it more than anything
Looks like a giant period 😂
Girl you are literally glowing you look so good, you look healthier, happier, tanner, and GORGEOUS! The fact you don’t think so breaks my heart! You look AMAZING!
The BARN is STUNNING!!! I LOVE IT!
I look forward to these videos more than anything else
OMG THEM GIVING YOU TAMALES AND PAN DULCE IS WHOLESOME , THEY LOVE YOU ❤️❤️❤️ mi raza❤️❤️
Better help charged my son $350 up front. The first "text session " the provider joined 15 minutes late and ended 10 minutes early. It was a joke and they wouldn't refund him.
The barn being red is perfection! 😍
OMG! morgan that poem was amazing even if you didnt write it. thank you for reading it to me.
You could never over share your thoughts or woes as you always get your feelings right out there front and center. You’ve an endearing soul. I’m here to see how all your personal decisions take charge. Never underestimate yourself.  Second guessing is humanistic. You’re human with a most wonderful outcome. Your barn is delicious!
Those guys going up those wobbly ass ladders still makes my butt pucker 😅
Wait when my home went through a year and half long renovation (while living in it) I DID become more appreciative of men too. But only the ones that build things.
I really loved this video from beginning to end!  & It’s okay to be sad it’s okay to feel the way you feel. I am really happy for you! You do deserve this and to be happy ❤
I was team white barn, and I was completely wrong ❤
You had me until you called a concha cinnamon bread. 😒
So is the barn you're actual home?
Loving the red barn!
please for the love of god do more research on better help,  they have scammed so many people and i dont understand why people have forgotten this.
You are too obnoxious for me! No thanks
Address the ozempic
Morgan the barn and you look absolutely incredible!!!!! I’m so happy for you. Watching you grow and get your glow makes me so happy. Love you girl ❤
Morgan  the barn rocks, btw, you are beautiful please believe me
I love how  the barn looks & the red ♥️ color so beautiful ❤️😍
Fall vibes
🇨🇭☕️💯
I’m so glad you didn’t finish the vlog without the poem I e been clawing my way out from hell and I personally loved and needed to hear that after loosing my mother I thought things couldn’t get worse then I lost my father recently as well then caught my husband of 19 years and 3 sons cheating on me I’ve seen such darkness I didn’t want to live on. I’ve been trying my best lately to find purpose and to be strong for my sons and that poem man it got me it’s real I feel you Morgan living in your head is dark I just want to thankyou for being you and sharing it all there’s got to be more to come it is only up too us personally to dig out of it and live on thankyou chook I appreciate it all enjoy that hilltop you deserve it my friend 🥰🙌xx
Morgan, usually I’m a silent subscriber and supporter but you genuinely give me so much joy and motivation. I aspire to be as strong, motivated, funny, real, and positive as you are. It’s been a dream of mine since a young age to move away from LA and buy a big plot of land and have a barn and lots of animals.. you give me a lot of hope that this dream is possible. Thank you for being you and making me realize that this dream is actually possible. You are amazing and thank you for all you do. Words don’t do justice to this how uplifting and inspiring you are!
The barn is gorgeous, but you know—it ain’t called “barn red” for nothin’.
I love that red! Looks great!!!
Likes to be vertical.....proceeds to gesture horizontal 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm deceased
Glad to see you on a hill rather than a valley. I say I'm on a rollercoaster most of the time. And sometimes hate the highs because they make the lows feel lower. But I'm very glad to see things going better for you. And hope you have much more time going up.
This red barn will look magical when it snows and around Christmas time.
Someone please tell her what vertical means 😂❤
The barn is so gorgeous with the fall colors. My brain is definitely chaotic, dark, stressed, and haunted too. You’re not alone. ❤
MORGAN THE RED WAS THE MOVE 🥂
Maybe it’s weird to name a barn, but I think you should name it “Clifford” 🥰😂💓
WE LOVE OLIVIAAA
You need a blue collar Colorado country boy, stop dating in LA <3
You need a barn quilt now 😍
Mom: *disappointed* “Morgan, that’s not a good thing to admit to” 😂😂
Morgan I just wanted to say that you are beautiful and take great selfies. Its funny how we all don't like pictures of ourselves, don't worry I get it, but you ARE beautiful.  Also, the barn looks great! I was wondering if you were considering a weather vane? I think that would be an awesome accessory to the barn. Love you so much. xoxo
Love the freaking red barn!! ❤️‍🔥 It’s fire!! 🔥
loving the red barn!! it’s gonna be worth it, hard work pays off girl! bought a house myself this year and i’ve been doing some small renovations myself 🥰🏡 love this channel and so excited to see what’s to come!
I don't believe your affinity towards your black widow is coincidental. Your at a stage in your life spider symbolism is relevant, in that you both weave your own story/home. She tend to her needs, wants and desires to nurture herself. Female spiders are notorious for many things... have a read and see if anything resonates
Just in time for me to start cooking dinner thx u bae
I love how the guys are really excited for the barn too! it does look amazing. bravo
when you said "my red barn is your red barn" 🥹 girl we really been thru this with you feels like!!
I love Bryan so much
Love you Morgan 😊
Painted my interior Swiss milk. It’s more cream. I kinda wish I’d done a diff color 🤔but I think It’s only because everyone has some shade of grey..
Morgan, I don’t know you but from what you show on the internet.  Your content, style and delivery are fucking top notch!! Entertaining in all ways! And girl!!!! You are gorgeous! I hope you are see through the filters of your experiences the beautiful woman your audience sees.  The more you see it the more we get to see from you!   Love the red barn!  Great choice! And I’m a former Sherwin Williams employee! Best paint! Yes!! ❤  I’m remodeling as well so I understand the journey your on! Press on girl!
Ugh i’m so happy you uploaded, what a great day early birthday gift ❤
Its all coming together so well ❤ im so emotionally invested in you and your house! I cant wait until its done and the interior decorating starts!!!!
Love all of it Morgan!!!!!
She’s painting the town RED 🥰
MORGAN THE BARN IS FREAKIN CUTE!!
Why is Morgan's mom always correcting and condescending to Morgan but never to ryland? Seriously pisses me off. She reminds me alot of my mom, minus the alcoholic
The fall leaves, the red barn!! It’s all coming together
I didn't notice until 24:30 that you were sitting in front of the porta-potty lol
Red barn + yellow tree ❤
Can't wait to see the house finished! Btw vertical is up and down, your hand went horizontal. Lol
I’m literally still crying — truly a beautiful end to such a joyful video. That writing that you read touched something deep within my brain. So thank you.   We are not defined by our darkness ❤
The Big Red Barn is beautiful, and I love the messages in this video 🩷
YAY! The barn looks lovely
Omg I want to be your friend so bad
Morgan- I wish you could see yourself through someone else’s (anyone else’s) eyes, you are so pretty!
I'mma be honest I was a lil nervous for you in the beginning but girl it's the very very best Red Barn I have ever seen  😭😭😭😭
You are not alone. That was beautifully written.   Amazing choice on the barn! ❤
A red barn is a true classic. It turned out awesome!!
One thing about my people….we love to feed people ☺️
Vertical would be standing
Iconic. ❤
It looks amazing
I'm so very proud of your adulting journey ❤️
Morgannnn your skin looks SO good you're glowing 😩❤
OMG tell me why I had the same thoughts today! I was like, why do Gen Z girls hate men, I love hAving my dad and husband doing all the hard work. Cause girl, I was spray painting a big mirror and I kept making mistakes. But if my dad or husband would've been there, they would've finished in a heart beat and I wouldn't be sweating outside. . I believe we can do anything men can but they FOR SURE can do it better and faster. Thank God for them!
The audible gasp I did when I saw the inside of the house like wow Morgan it’s finally happening!!! I’m so proud of you
I love to crochet hunny what colours do you like? A fan from Canada 🇨🇦 I am recovering from dental surgery thank  the Lord  for legal drugs
This video was so frontal lobe developing coded
Morgan your body is my ideal body you looking banging gurl
YAY!! 👏👏👏THE BAR BARN IS RED.
Morgan, take the pictures! I'm in my 50s and I wish I had more pics of when I was younger. You are stunning! <3
You look so amazing Morgan, I’m so proud of you 🥲
Thanks for that last quote 🥹
💚🖤❤️🤠🎃I'm in tears of joy for you congrats on the barn!!! and also you just make my day shine and bring laughter when it's much needed. Can't express how much your videos have helped me emotionally and mentally this past two years. Thank you Morgan for sharing your valleys and hill climbs! I loved that analogy I wrote it down.. and added, "once u conquer on mt. The only way to conquer the next is to go down threw the valley for a bit".  You're a blessing thank u again for the content.
Love the scene cuts with the Polaroids ❤
Morgan, go look for and purchase the children’s book, “The Big Red Barn”. It’s in the “Goodnight Moon” genre. Your barn IS the barn from the book and I read this freaking book a million times to my children(now 24 and 20 and forever 3). I ♥️ your barn! It’s perfect! Congratulations😊
I wasn’t sure how I would feel about the red (lol not like it matters🤣) but when I saw it I was like YASSS 😍 It looks so great! Also, I love your little talks or “oversharing”! It’s nice to see someone so genuine and open.  It’s crazy how we don’t see in ourselves what other people see in us sometimes. Every time it shows little Polaroids of you I think “Omg she’s so cute! I wish I looked like that!” Then you said you never like pictures of yourself I just couldn’t believe it! I hate how we just tear ourselves apart sometimes, but in a way it’s nice you are so open about your struggles because it normalizes that no matter how perfect someone’s life seems we all struggle with mental/physical health issues. ❤
Not Morgan calling conchas “cinnamon bread”😩🤣🤣💗
Proud of you stranger friend ❤
Once again, I feel like I am listening to my best friend vent to me and I absolutely am here for it. 🩷❤🖤
❤
Im so happy that things are going so much better in your life, you definetly deserve it, and you're so brave for showing your vulnerability
the end..omg im crying
I hope she helps us all to remember that we can all move on, we can all acknowledge our old selves, whilst leaving them in the past and finding our new path. I hope I remember to take that lesson too
The thing is you think you don't deserve any of this great things in your life, but you do. You're awesome Morgan we love you're whole face!!! Another thing that big ass beautiful red barn is so damn amazing that you should be very freaking proud of it Morgan!! ❤ya!!!
21:56 🥹🥹🥹

Swiss Coffee is the default paint color for every single apartment in Los Angeles.
I'm happy for you ❤🎉
the red barn is absolutely beautiful.
"I am a bitch that likes to be vertical" and makes a horizontal line with your hand😂😂😂
I needed those words of encouragement so bad, I appreciate you so much ! - Girl in a valley </3
I say it alll the time! I love men! It’s brave and controversial to say in these days lol but, it’s what I think lol😂
SLAY
Your gratitude and happiness is shining through! I’m happy to see you happy !🩷
Morgan you’re honestly one of my main YouTubers I constantly wait for and you just give me hope when I have bad days or even good ones tbh that wants me to say let’s keep going it’s like a mental reset thank you for sharing your red barn and house remodeling content  Here’s to 20 something’s 🫶🏼 Love you Morgan 🩷
Morgan you should be a counsellor .  You are so understanding and real.  Love the barn |
Wow. That poem really hit this 58 year old HARD. SO poignant!
Please come to Kansas City 😂❤❤❤
I am so happy for you Morgan. You have grown through all the hoops, ups and downs you had to encounter to have your home. You should be proud of yourself. Congrats to your angels too! Thank you for helping Morgan get her forever home. 🎉🎉🎉
RIDE THAT HILL QUEEN ILY S'MUCH

The yellow tree next to the red barn is actually really pretty I bet people stop for fall pictures ! ❤
Morgan I'm crying on a Tuesday night 😢😢😢😅❤❤❤ I think u should do this for every video, just a sentimental quote that you saw or read and give your insights to it. I think it's beautiful 🥰🫠😭🥺🥹
I wish you saw yourself how we see you! We love you. ❤
Love Morgan pack bonding with a black widow 😂
@0:49 bish you been crying don’t lie 😂
So fuggin happy for you duuuuude fuck
So proud of you Morgan ❤
😅 im confused is her house the white one and the barn is extra space?  Whats the barn gonna be for? because they're redoing inside so looks like a house as well (is it a guest house)?
Morgan thank you for reading that from rainbowsalt! That was meant for you to hear and feel deep into your soul and I felt it so much I’m sitting here sobbing cause at 55 years old I’ve gave up on ever finding my happy spot in life and I dwell on my past mistakes and they do haunt me in my dreams as well as daily and just listening to that beautiful passage she wrote you opened up my mind to possibilities that I can find my happy place and not only find it, it can meet me half way and just knowing that I truly think I’ll sleep and have sweet dreams tonight instead of being haunted by my mistakes. I love your red barn as much as I love you Morgan. I’m so torn between wanting it all to be finished for you but I’m going to miss your videos of it coming together. I love that you love the men in your life! You’ve stumbled upon an incredible team that has not only great workmanship but beautiful personalities that shine and they’ve brought out a side of you that has made your light shine so bright and I’m living my life vicariously thru you and loving every min you share with the universe! Keep shining  beautiful lady! Thank you for making my day brighter! ❤❤❤
Absolute love the way the barn turned out!!!!!!!!!! I couldn’t imagine it any other way
I absolutely love your videos. Please never stop posting because it’s so refreshing to hear someone who says your exact thoughts without ever speaking them 💛
It looks amazing. We love and support you
Omg!! Work put me through it!! This is just the happiness I need!!!
If I tried to spray paint and climb up a ladder at the same time I would for sure fall off 😅
Morgan, you're so beautiful. We are our own worse critics....always. Remember we think you're a beautiful human inside & out❤❤
It makes me think of snuggling up in a big bed-sized piece of fluffy bread
People who live on that street are going to give directions to their houses based on your big red barn,! “If you’ve gotten to the big beautiful red barn, you’ve gone too far!”
I love you!! Barn looks amazing!!
Morgan coined the term 'embreaded' and I'm using it from here on out.
Morgan its all coming together...i love the barn...you are glowing hunni...so happy for you xx ❤❤❤
Morgan has saved Colorado by painting the Barn red & it looks EPIC!!!!!
She’s taking longer then sharee from real housewives of Atlanta 😂
Babe Al dente means the pasta isn’t overcooked. It still has a slight crunch lol. It can be hot and al dente.
Not me crying over a red barn and a poem at 7 pm on a Tuesday
I love how Morgan called pan dulce cinnamon bread. ❤
everything looks fabulous!
Btw the spray painting guys complimented your choice of color and your eyes
“My mom makes me toaster waffles and peanut butter” I feel personally attacked! 😂
I am IN LOVE with our red gorgeous barn. ❤ With that beautiful yellow tree aside
Morgan ik damn well you did not just call concha’s cinnamon bread 😪
You said it right 💖
Luv the red ❤🌹🍁🍎
The barn really looks amazing and I’m just so happy for you!! And I love when you over share because you’re so real about it. Which is super relatable. And you got so lucky with all those guys and I love that they came in and saved you because some men will. They all seem super nice and they were exactly what you needed 🥹🫶🏼💖✨ (I ship you and Luke so much there’s an over share for ya 💖☺️🥰🤣) love you girl, so good to hear from you.
Love ❤ the red barn
I personally like the white, it makes it look nice and fresh, but as long as you love it girl that all the matters!
I’m so excited to see a Christmas tree in that living room!!!
Men didn't save you Morgan- it's literally their job
Morgan! We have a similar body type and the jeans you’re wearing at 1:10 fit you PERFECTLY! I can never find that style to fit me, where did you get them??! ❤❤
I've been watching the barn process since day 1 and have a understanding that's your home, do your Parents own the white house next to it? I've always been curious and int is vlog you brought up the white house. lol just me being nosey. Have a great day!
Morgan you are one of the most beautiful &real YouTuber I watch.
it’s spooky season so you should TOTALLY decorate ur barn with halloween decorations !!!!!!
Moving on is not only OK, it's necessary to get the life you want
❤❤❤
I gave you a like, charity work of the day accomplished🎉
Morgan all your choices are beautiful because they are yours .❤the poem its like you needed to hear that ,so you to the lady whom wrote it ❤😊 keep going your almost there girl 😊so proud of your progress 😊
You deserve All the Hills!!! Wishing u  Valley free for A long time❤❤
That touched me at the end to the core! You deserve this Morgan and I’m so happy to see you HAPPY!! Xoxox
hello morgan!! i’ve missed you 😌 ur barn looks AMAZING !!!!!!!!!! and ur house is looking great too :) it makes me happy seeing you make so much progress & it’s obviously making you happier too (considering the amount of struggling you’ve gone through with this house lol). also, don’t apologize for over sharing bc it never feels that way tbh! it just feels like a friend calling me, updating me on the hot goss LOL. keep it up morgan! you’re doing great :)
Morgan addressing the HOA and neighbors watching 😂
You have permission to relax, expect good things and be happy!
So happy to seee youuuu can’t wait to see it finished!! 🫶🏼💖✨
The red barn with the fall colored leaves on the trees in the background is so pretty.
Thanks for lifting men up in this video, Morgan!
Without a word of a lie yesterday I checked the channel thinking it's been a while since the last video and yay you uploaded today 😊
If we were friends in real life, I'd make you tamales and bake you sweet bread.
My favorite parts of Morgan’s vids are the Polaroid picssss so CUTE
14:40-14:48 😂😂
Your mom not being able to handle that you use a different brand of paint is sending me. "I don't want to know that." lmaooo
doja has been real quiet since this video dropped
red was absolutely the right choice for the barn
10:59-11:03 how would it look offensive
Great job, Morgan! Your house is finally coming together! I’m so excited to see you make this a cozy home.😊
I have Swiss coffee in my living room and I absolutely love it!
Damn girl, props to you and your crew for doing the damn thang. It's coming together, the barn is gorgeous 😍
I love watching you. I think that you are one of the most honest influencers here on YouTube. I love the making of your dream home. I am so happy for you. Can't wait to see what the finished product comes out to look like. Wishing you all the best.
I’m not going to lie, last video I was so so sad and distraught that you were trying to paint the barn red. And though I do love the clean look of the white, the red is gorgeous. Good on you, Morgan ♥️
Morgan you need to do like an Amazon register would love to send you a house warming present.
I love how you are showing Men is such a positive light during all this Morgan!!  They really do seem to get a very bad rap on Social Media and in general anymore.  This entire process has shown how there are a lot of men who are decent who want and are willing to help, in so many ways.   Of course there are shit ones. But there are shit women too!  But there a lot of decent ones out there who are truly good people. I’m so glad you’ve had so many great ones helping you out along this journey. 😊
Morgan, your exterior voice is not very nice to you. Say beautiful things to you. You are supposed to love yourself so others know to love you too ! Brightest Blessings Babe!
Surround yourself with GOOD men, Morgan. ❤
I am so happy Morgan’s home is coming together! The red barn looks soooo cute ❤❤
Bryan sounding like a proud uncle 😂
3:10 it looks great!
I can’t wait for move in day
You’re the freaking best Morgan!!! Love your updates on the red Barn and I love hearing about your personal growth and feelings throughout this whole process!! So awesome to have a positive space like your channel to just be real and genuine! Love always!!! Xoxo
I love it!
They are called conchas 😂❤
So proud of you Morgan 🥰
I also got attached to two spiders that lived in my mailbox but one day the mailman shoved a magazine inside and killed one of them. Can’t help but think it’s now lonely and a widow now and it makes me sad lol
Can we please talk about how freaking adorable your painters were! The little dance at the start of the painting section was adorable!
You so deserve this and more.
I'm going to be sad when the house is complete, I love these house reno vlogs of it coming together.
Morgan, I’ve been in the mud and the filth, covered in 🩸the world war in my brain! I’ve lost countless battles, I’ve struggled and cried and hurt myself and beat my own azz. I spent 3 yrs in bed. H8ing myself! Why me? I’ll tell you why me, the short answer is, God (or who you believe in or don’t) gives his/hers/they/them strongest warriors the hardest and longest battles, because he knows we are his strongest and will pull through and survive. We will do more than survive, we will thrive! Everyone’s thrive is different. Mine is getting out of bed and being as present as my ADHD, PTSD, and faith will allow. Am I perfect everyday NO! Perfect is not achieviable ever! We do the best that we can. And, that’s enough! I’ve been married 25 yrs I’m clean 21 yrs my husband and family by the grace of God have never left me. My family supports me the best they’re able to. And, that’s enough. Im enough. I can say that today, because today I know this, yesterday and tomorrow don’t matter! You are loved, you are enough, you are blessed. Your still here! My nephews struggles and unimaginable pain took him to God at 17. He was needed elsewhere to do Gods work in a different way. God had more work to be done so his brother followed him at 21. My only nephew’s live in heaven. At first i h8ted God, my faith was being tested. I strayed because I was in pain and angry, blaming him and others. I was heartbroken and miserable. I listened to their mothers pain every day for years. It broke me every day. Now I know I was doing Gods will not mine. And my anger is better today and I’m trying to have acceptance and love and faith. It’s never easy! Idk who started a rumor that life should be easy, because I believed it, and it’s a lie! Nothing worth doing is easy. I’m not a church member, I don’t preach or judge. I have no religion other than on my birth certificate. Many, many years ago I was a forced Protestant. Im spiritual. God knows my heart and that’s ENOUGH!!! Keep it pushin or you’ll miss the beauty of you! Stop beating yourself up, stop hurting yourself stop lying to yourself, sounds easy right? It’s not. Work needs to happen. It’s the only way. I love you, I’ve watched you grow and change through highs and lows. Your right where your supposed to be! I love your red barn! I was so happy to see your video. You give me strength. Your beautiful and kind and fun. Much love from NYC ♥️🎤 positive rant over 🤣🤣🤣
Keep riding those hills Queen 👑 your big red barn is pure joy ❤
"I am a bitch that likes to be verticial" *motions horitzontally* sorry this had me laughing. This is something I would do/say.
The Red Barn is proud and beautiful Morgan! A place future generations will go to contemplate rejuvenate . Now cut the tree branch back that’s threatening the well being of your roof darling!
You made me miss my therapist 😢 she was perfect for me. Shes been on maternity leave since may. I’m ready for her to come back!!!  Awwww my heart when the painters feed you and asked if you liked it. Such a LatinX thing to do
I couldn’t stand your music selection in this vlog 😖
Looove rainbowsalt
It’s so annoying to me that the HOA would give you so many issues when you’re LITERALLY making the house so much better than it was before
2 things..the white was better. I think the red looks boring and has no personality like someone from Kansas. and second, stop giving your power away...men did not save you. They wouldn't be there if you weren't paying them. If society didn't make women think they cant do construction, there would be more women in construction now and they would be saving you. That's all. You are doing everything really well, just stop making yourself look like you don't know anything or you are dumb, it ain't cute!
Yay! I love to see you Morgan I'm so glad your house is getting done finally, you deserve it girl❤❤❤
Love the colour of the barn and really loved the end of the vlog. Thank you for sharing.
Am i the only one overanalyzing Morgan saying when did men become a big part of my life 👀
Where can I find the flag sweater? 🇺🇸🦅
6:30 You mean horizontal not vertical 😘 I know this because I say this all the time about myself!
The red barn is so pretty with all the tree's changing colors 😊
❤omg Morgan looks so much thinner now ❤ get that fitness thing ❤
I’m pretty sure you meant to say you’re a b*tch that likes to be horizontal. Vertical means up and down. Horizontal (think sun sets on the horizon) means level. Easier to be lying down all day than up.
Morgan - ‘i like to be Vertical’  Morgan - draws a horizontal line  😂😂😂😂😂
The RED looks so good - but also the white interior / room looks amazing!! 👏🫶✨️
Creamy from Sherwin Williams is a wonderful white!! I have my entire house painted in it. It’s white but now bright white. It’s neutral which is nice!
She got that ozempic look
i love the way morgan seems to have fun with _everyone_ 🥹 so excited for the barn!!
free Palestine!!!!!!!!!!!
Morgan, you are glowing! It goes to show what good people and good energy can do for someone. Not to take away from all the work you’ve done on your own but you just seem so genuinely happy!💕
what happened to the guy who everyone shipped morgan with? i havent been caught up
I'm so confused wasnt the black and white something she did purposely for her bar(n) look?
I think you confused vertical and horizontal 😂
The hills and valleys talk was so needed ❤ the barn and house are looking so beautiful
Morgan you look so good! Glowing with happiness ☺️
There are so many people that get attacked by the very dangerous animal they’re insistent on saving. Watch, Morgan is gonna get bitten by that black widow. It would be just her luck. Not sure why she’s tempting fate keeping that thing around.
Al dente is how much its cooked not how hot its served. Just saying :) Also eggs are not dairy lol. Memories. Sometimes I think you are trying to be the new Jessica Simpson.
Love seeing you so happy!! There was so much that I needed to hear in this. Thank you for taking us with you 💜
Love the barn. I would consider a white with more of a pink or red hint, it would look less muddy. It would also kinda glow at sunset. Everything looks phenomenal. I'm so happy you're making progress and that you decided to keep it. That really is an awesome property.
Omg I love the smell of rubber cement!
Painters are freaking amazing. Inside and outside they knock out jobs so quickly. I love your barn and you are a sweetheart. Nobody is throwing darts at you.
Looking sooo good!!! ❤❤❤❤
Biiiig facts on the “social media making us hate men” theory. Like it’s a problem I’m actively having to work through. 🥲
The librarian at my highschool had cement paint. That shit hits.
Who sued Morgan ?? 😅
Yay Morgan you look happy ❤
thank you for adding that ending it. it was something i really needed to hear.
I love the barn!!! ❤
I’m gonna be delulu and pretend you named the black widow after me 🥹❤️
that is fab, cannot wait until you have it complete
LOVE LOVE LOVE THE COLOR OF THE BARN  And Grandma is just the cutest!
The barn looks absolutely AMAZING 🤩 also to see your house coming together so well and beautifully is making me feel so happy and proud for you 🥹
So happy for you Morgan 💛 where are your sunglasses from that your wearing right at the beginning? Xx
I needed to hear that last part thank you 🥲❤️
Horizontal
Twinning! I feel like we work with the same brain. But so happy to see the beautiful transition of your home and beautiful red barn. 💕💕💕
I love the red, barns are supposed to be red. It’s a beautiful barn!! Those men are lucky to have you in their lives! Love and hugs to you dear Morgan!!
Morgan the barn looks beautiful and so are you girl.
Thanks for making fry in my car at 4:57 on a Tuesday. I needed that.😢
I just realized my boyfriend is related to Morgan’s mom 😲
The barn looks amazing!!!❤❤
Congrats!
☆♡☆♡☆♡☆♡
Bryan out here being super supportive.  Love to see it. ❤
4 words: Benjamin Moore White Dove.  My mom is a white paint aficionado
Awesome vlog Morgan thumb up
I don’t think it’s that we “hate” men it’s mostly that we’ve fallen into their traps one too many times and we know and recognize the red flags and want everyone else to know that we’ve been there and you’re not alone. . We’re not going to fall for the traps again we’re smarter especially uniting and acknowledging that we’ve been through similar situations . 😭😖 it’s not all men. But we only need to see the red flags once 🚩😌🧘‍♀️
The barn is beautiful and perfect.
Thank you for sharing the poem at the end, it was a beautiful way to remember moving on after a terrible loss is possible.❤
finally someone else admits to huffing rubber cement as a child. I've never known anyone else lmao 😭
I am so good you found an amazing construction company and crew
I am a fellow oversharer. I've learned to embrace it and own it. You get what you get, no need to ask. lol
I love the relationship you have with the people that are working on your house. I’m sure the guys really appreciate that and the painters sharing a home cooked meal with you is very generous! I hope you gave them a good bonus!
I wish you knew how much you’ve helped me over the past couple of years. Our lives are strangely parallel (to an extent of course) and what you’ve shared has always been at the right time for me. You’re not over sharing, you’re helping a community grow and learn and giggle
Gravity at Lowe’s!!  Trust me
The being comfortable around a bunch of men is kind of how I feel working as an EMT lol. There’s a few women, but being mostly around men all day, they become very protective of the new EMT girly and I just love them all 😂
I think you mean horizontal. Not vertical
I definitely needed this video today,,
McKenna Lee just did gray mist on her house and it’s so pretty !!!
Love you Morgan❤
the barn looks gorgeous!
Idk if Morgan willl ever see this but… I just want to say that every time you post and I get that notification I have a smile on my face!!! You are so down to earth relatable and just genuine, it give me someone to relate too! And I feel like your house is my house and the struggle is reall! Im just so genuinely happy that I found you as a influencer/vlogger/ person it just makes my day, and I’m so proud that things are finally starting to look up for you.   And also girl you did not have to make me cry at 3:39 on a random Tuesday like girl, but I loved the last segment 🫶🏻🫶🏻   Anyways that’s a lot much love and I love your channel and you :)
You look different than you did before. You look happy.
The funk rant is too real for me 😂
OH MY GOD! LOVESSSSSS IT!!!!  The barn is everything - perfect color! BTW, I love your team! They are all awesome!
I love it! And I love you Morgan.
Morgan❤
you make me feel hope
Like how the video clip was on my birthday 😂 and here I am watching it depressed and wanting to be horizontal. Also I’m sorry Morgan but better help is garbage…they tried to just put me on pills and then took my money even tho I never got to talk to a therapist or ordered medication. They’re just trying to make money and absolute garbage of a company
Do I see a comp!etion party celebration for you and your construction crew in the near future??  Everything looks fantastic.  You should be very proud.
Big scary spider 😂😂. Laughing in Australian.
the barn looks amazing! great decision
Love how it turned out!! 😊
It looks so good!!! So glad there's finally massive progress
I have total barn envy!❤😊
It’s very upsetting to me as a severe arachnophobe that your spider has my name 😢😂
The barn is literally going to be a Hallmark Christmas movie set when it snows. ❤ love it so much!!
I went from being in awe of the cute bar-n to laughing at your moms camera work to balling my eyes out at the end of the video because I couldn’t relate more. Love you so much Morgan🫶🏻
The massage at the end hit me so very hard you have no idea how much my heart needed to hear those words ❤😭 Thank you so much for sharing them 💜💜💜 Love you so much Morgan 💕💕💕
It's bec of you... I feel better now.
❤
Swiss coffee has been horrible in both houses I’ve purchased. It’s a contractors color and if you have anything that’s white next to it the walls look yellow.
The painter dude has EYESSSSS girl he is SO SLAYYY
Ok but I need to know what texturing the walls means. Is it like popcorn ceilings? I'm in Australia and I've never heard of it.   I had to write a new comment because my last was about meditation and this comment is a total about face in terms of subject lol.
That barn is EVERYTHING ❤❤❤
I’m SO SO excited for you!
Love these updates! Makes me so happy seeing your home/BARn coming together so beautifully :))) So incredibly happy for you Morgan you waited so long for these moments and they are finally here!!! 🎉🏡❤
You might like practicing lovingkindness meditation. It's really lovely and helps you connect to yourself and to the world with a sense of acceptance and knowing you're not dealing with crap alone. Sharon Salzberg is one of my favourite people writing about lovingkindness.
loved the Tio's in this episode 'add a little bit of spice"
Also girl! I keep spiders as pets and I have to say I never saw that coming for you, but holy cow I LOVE THE LOVE YOU HAVE FOR OLIVA!!!!
The red barn looks so gorgeous amongst the beautiful autumn leaves 😍🍁You made the perfect choice!!!
The barn is truly stunning. It pops and definitely catches your attention. I'm happy that after years you get the home of your dreams and maybe you had to go through all these so you can stay forever. It is perhaps the universe way of pointing out to you that this is where you belong. Because otherwise you wouldn't have fought so hard. ❤ Love you Morgan!
Me likee!❤
I like your flag sweater And your red barn 😊
"My red barn is your red barn" why'd that make me so emotional...must be my current valley. I'll climb out of my valley to go to your hill with the red barn. (did that make sense)
I'm happy cuz ur happy and that everything is finally coming together in ur life. U got this girl. Love u since day 1 😊❤
Oof. I definitely needed that last message too. 😭 I can’t wait to see your home come together for you Morgan.
Oh cool, Morgan, now I'm crying. Wth
Morgan and the BIG red barn 🙌🏼🥰
🎶Morgan don’t care she paint the barn red🎶
God I am gonna miss Byran
Words Can’t Express how happy I am for you Morgan💐💐💐💐💐💐💐
Here for the hot goss!
*5years later* "Did we finish the barn? Update
I’m so happy for you and all the growth you are having !!  You deserve all the good things and the barn is beautiful 😩🙏🏻🥹👏🏻💜💜💜💜
I watched this whilst putting on makeup but then cried part of it off because I really needed to hear that last part of what you read! 😭 Anyway, I really love the red barn and the peace that the inside of that white room brings! Much love to you and all! ❤️
i did not see the vision for the red barn but i loooove the result ! can't believe that you might be moving into the house sooner rather than later, love u morgan ❤️
We Mexicans are the hardest workers 😌
Daily top :   Drink coffee before sex .
Damn girl. You didn’t have to make me cry at 4pm on a Tuesday 😢
Morgan, your a beautiful young lady, Blessings for you always!!!❤
I love the posts by rainbowsalt.  They seem to show up just when you need them ❤ I LOVE the red barn.  So glad you did it.  It makes it stand out in the very best way.
as a swedish viewer i'm so *_thrilled_* about the red barn! 😍❤ it turned out beautiful!
Your home is beautiful. And the barn!!! Yes!!! Love a red barn. Iconic
Such a last minute change!  I thought you were doing white with black trim on everything,  that would have been so nice
Morgan, I reallllllly needed the quote you read at the end of your video and the inspirational chat. I’ve had a really rough week, and you said exactly what I needed to hear. ❤ also your red barn is awesome. Appreciating your uploads, thank you!! ☺️
Just don't get rid of the trees, just give them a short bob.
The hot goss scene sunglasses are to die for what brand are they 😍
No one’s gonna mention that she used vertical instead of horizontal haha
Honestly I wasn’t excited about the red but it looks so good!
I L❤️VE IT!!!!
Does anyone know what camera Morgan uses to take the photos at 3:44?
This video brought me so much of a boost you can’t imagine. I’ve been struggling with motivation and confidence and seeing this happen for Morgan and her pep talk has me thriving today and working even harder to leave this “living in my own sad world”. ❤❤
Tell me why i’ve been watching this since she started the reno’s and only last week did i clue that there was also a house. I thought you were doing up the barn to live in!!!! How did i not know there’s a fullass house attached. When i say my mind was blown, oh honey
I love how at 22:34 the light shining on the side of the barn look like little hearts
Love the red barn!  It’s gorgeous!  Just like you, gorgeous!  ❤❤❤❤
These videos make me so happpppyyyy!!!!
Love the red you picked for your barn! God speed on finishing your home. 😊🙏🏾
I am so proud of Morgan for seeing this complicated project through to the end. The house is beautiful and the barn is perfect!!! I really hope Morgan stays in the house.
The barn looks gorgeous! ♥️
That barn looks FABULOUS!!! I’m so happy for you Morgan! ♥️🥰☀️
Morgan thank you for sharing that at the end. Girl you made me cry on a Tuesday too!
My bf is also a kappa sigma. Yes, you definitely can tell when men are in a frat lol
🤍
When people ask for directions from now on….they’ll say turn right or left after the beautiful red barn….making history girl…love it. Stay safe well and happy x
thats the hot goss
With each new release of the house series I can’t tell you how excited I am to see what’s next for you. To see a vlog with you in your house doing your thing is bringing me immense joy. I’m so excited and happy for you. I love you!
My favorite blogger! 😊🩷🩷🩷
Red barn (Morgan’s version) ❤
Skinny legend wtf where’s the rest of you!!! You look great
I can't believe you left  that massive fart in at 1:56
I wish the barn was taupe
I needed this today. Love Morgan ❤
So nice to FINALLY see Morgan get her dreams with this house. Never give up
I literally love your content Morgan. Thank you for being you. Thank you for being so vulnerable on a platform where most just put on an act for the glitz and glam. I’m so glad watching Shane and Ryland brought me to you. You’re amazing. I’m so happy to see you build a home for yourself. It’s so inspiring. I hope no matter the lows and highs of your life you can see how beautiful you are to those who are around you and watch you. If authenticity was a person it’d be you.
The way you pronounce tamales was so funny to me, I'm sorry
We had an adorable house that looked like your barn, red and all.
Rooting for Olivia ✌️
Girl the red looks amazing!!
Barn looks great, really making progress
I appreciate you sharing that a the end Morgs really needed to hear it <3 Enjoy the moment fugg the past!!!
Morgan is a freaking Slay
Justin just pissed off all of Kansas lol. It looks awesome, Morgan!!!
Morgan you are the best! Taking care of your mental health is just as important as your physical body. You, Shane, Ryland (and let’s just say it…your whole family) make my bad days so happy! ❤
Honestly thank you for the spider warning. I hate when creators give me a bug jump scare and I'm living in fear for the next week. I appreciate you!
I love that the painters shared their breakfast with y’all, it’s tamales and Pan Dulce 😂
Tamales and conchas. Yummy😊
You deserve good things to cone to you.
I really needed to hear the quote at the end so thankyou!❤
Short hair is soo beautiful on you
Loved the picture in the end, happy you overcame it and posted it ❤
I’ve been here for all of the farm/house vlogs. And to finally see it come to life makes me so happy for you! ❤️
That yellow tree is perfection
Morgan… I cannot emphasize this enough… the red barn I EVERYTHING I am obsessed
Swiss coffee is beautiful, that’s what I used and love it
The red barn is going to look so beautiful surrounded by snow
It looks gorgeous! Especially with the changing tree colors ❤❤❤
The barn looks so pretty red!!
morgan you are glowing!!!!
You are doing an amazing job & you always have , be kind to yourself . Sending love 💗
Love you so much! 🥰
It looks GORGEOUS! And with the yellow tree🥰 our favorite food during fall and winter definitely are tamales and conchas with chocolate abuelita!🇲🇽. Can’t wait to see this beautiful project finished, and the friendship that was made🥲
Mommy!!!
you're definitely not alone with those feelings and emotions, reasons may differ, but the feelings are the same. I'm trying to play "strong woman" a lot less because I realised it may bring people down and make them feel like they're alone when I'm hurting too, but they don't know.... I don't want them to feel alone, we're all in this together
✨Morgan✨ Thanks for the quote, definitely summed up quite a bit for me too. Appreciate your kindness ❤
Hot goss is IN, SIS
Thank you for your vulnerability, the message you shared with us truly resonated. I always look forward to watching the universe be on your side during your fight for something more. Patience is our biggest tool, and forgiveness is our armor; the world feels less lonely knowing I'm not the only one focusing on being more kind to myself.
We just love your channel and watching updates on the house and you! I’ve been a fan for years. I’m in Colorado. If you ever want to do something paranormal creepy we are going to be starting a ‘hot ones" type of paranormal series of videos for celebrities!!! You are my first invite. 😄🥰 Who wants to see Morgan do something paranormal??? 👍👆
I love to see you so happy - and the red barn is perfection!
Red was the move. Perfect. Can't wait to see house done and this beautiful barn next to it. Reminds me of when I grew up on my farm and miss my late father. Just the best vibes
Morgan is the sister I always wished I had ❤
What is that background fart noise is that the song?! 1:56-1:57 😂😂😂 Im losin it
Morgan, please do your research on Better Help, they are not good, a lot of stuff went down about them, hope you have a great week 😀
Looks great 👍❤
Love the barn. Can't wait to see the house and barn come together. That is a huge black widow. The creepiest spideer I've ever seen is a sun spider, looks like a combo spider and scorpion mixed. One chased my 5 year old several.years ago.

It's all coming together so well. I can't wait until it's all done. luv the red barn. Also luv that u have made life-long friends with the amazing crew working on ur house. Do u think u will be sad when the works done and they aren't there daily?
You are so very deserving ❤❤❤
Remember. The dark valleys make us thankful for the BRIGHT BRILLIANT PEAKS! If I say so myself..That shiny peak looks GOOD ON YOU SWEETHEART!!! 🤍✨🥰
I’m so happy that your house is ch almost finished!! Can’t wait to see how you decorate the inside!!❤
I actually liked the white barn better. 🤷‍♀️
swiss coffee
I am so glad you got such a great team working on your home. It is really coming along nicely. And they are all nice people. The barn looks amazing and is so picturesque.  Also, thank you for being so open and honest about your struggles and your paths to overcome them. It is not only an inspiration, but also sheds a light on ways for others to deal with their obstacles.
Love the red barn! I'm so excited to see the final reveal of your home and amazing barn!
I love the red barn so much and the house giving me total ideas on what I want in my own house one day

I have a neighbor with a red barn style she-shed and it sort of peaks out of the trees in all of my photos of people sitting in my porch swing. But you can’t tell the size of it at that angle so it looks like I live on a farm. It’s cute and love it.
Not Morgan apologizing for sharing her thoughts and feelings on her channel, amiga we are here for that exactly 🧡 sweetest guys! The way you’re glowing knowing you can trust your team is amazing 🫶🏽
Ahh, yes, it tracks that he’s a kappa sig
Can link that post from rainbow salt? I went through her posts but can't find it. I need to save that
This "BIG RED BARN" , is the jewel of that neighborhood girl yessssss, really stunnin , not as much as you ... 💚❇💚🏡😍💖🐾🐾🐿🌾🍁🍃🍂🌿
Morgan, as always thank you for being so human on YouTube. And thank you for reading that passage because it really hits heart to me too and I'm glad that you get to remind me of certain life things and you really do put it in perspective and thank you, I love you and your videos!
Morgan saying "inbredded" sent me 😂 love you sis same 🥰😘
Red barn is I C O N I C!!
Morgan, I truly appreciate You and Your uniquely awesomeness!!! I love the way You allow Us to see Your slice of life through Your beautiful eyes!!! Never stop being so freaking Cool!!!! Thanks for sharing Your journey. I love all the progress, it looks Amazing!!!!  Lots of Love, Renee from Florida 🏖️🌴🌴 p.s. WE LOVE YOU RIGHT BACK!!!
Morgan you are amazing and I so enjoy all your videos I wish there were more…don’t let anyone tell you other wise… you are deserving of everything…let go and live girl
loved the video morgan... i also need the hot goss on the sunnies with the square logo. what are they?? they are fab
Congratulations Morgan your home is really coming together.  I enjoy your videos with you and your family.   Morgan you remind me of my daughter and her struggles to find a happy life.  I can relate to your words about climbing a mountain or falling into the valley.  I'm 60 and trying to climb that mountain is hard.  I get knocked down but I get up again.    You got this Morgan!  You go girl!
didn't (different) men mess up the house to begin with? lol
The barn looks amazing! I want tamales now.😋
I love the colour of your barn. It's so beautiful. What is the colour called as I want this for my art studio? I'm so happy for you Morgan.
You're so pretty just so you know. Brown is your colour I swear.
You are the only one I watch the commercials for. ❤️
Morgan I love you 💚
I think you’re stunningly gorgeous but I think it would be a lot of fun for you to take a modeling class to get yourself more comfy with photos of yourself!!! You may have a breakthrough in the discomfort ✨   All I know is that the world needs to see more of your beautiful face!!!!!
6:16 girl why you talking about yourself but deflecting it on us??
Clifford the Big Red Barn is here! ❤
I’m a bitch that likes to be vertical! *signals horizontally* 🤣
Nothing wrong with eastern Kansas! Cone on over Morgan!
The red was such a good move. It’s looking so good!!
Your barn looks AMAZING! And you look so gorgeous in this video. <3 It's always a good day when Morgan posts. :) The way you edit is so flawless, love every moment of your videos.  That ending really struck a chord with me... thank you for sharing that.
I love the barn color. That deep red is Gorgeous 🥰. Morgan you are freaking gorgeous and get more beautiful every year so stop with the negativity about your looks. Your a damn Angel.
Imbreaded? Morgan made a new word, lolol 😂
you look amazing literally glowing ✨✨
Legitimately, the phrase "not all men" finally has meaning now seeing the men who came into your life and helped you. Lowkey gives me hope lol.
BM paint, yuck. Js
Finally I missed you ❤
I hope you tip them extremely well
The red barn is EVERYTHING! ❤❤❤
I LOVE YOU MORGAN!
That’s the hot goss
Everything is moving along beautifully. Love the color of the barn, classic with a modern twist. Look forward to seeing more of the progress of your home. :)
We love u Morgan u are amazing
You look so good 🤩
you are so right ! im so tired of the whole '' hate on men;; epidemic , men deserve so much love and recognition fr , im so glad you said it , makes me love you even more haha
Love you, Morgan. You are just awesome. The barn color is _beyond_ perfection. And now that the inside is "imaginable" - DAMN, GIRL! You're going to have the NICEST home that you put your entire mind, body (sometimes!), and soul into. You PAINED over and for this house. AND IT'S YOURS! So unbelievably proud of you - a stranger that is somehow not a stranger. You may not know it yet - but you're doing this "life" thing pretty well. You have amazing parents (thank God every day - as I did, too,) who brought you and your brothers up RIGHT. Love this video. Love your home. Love your hair length. Love your spirit. An A+ human being. Thanks for being REAL!
It was a fantastic call on the red barn. It really makes the windows pop with black framing. I can't wait to see more. Morgan, you look fabulous, with a beautiful smile. So find that theme song that makes that confident you and strut that gorgeous you. See you next time ❤
Girl without your parents, and how life turned out for you you would be a unhous like me
Your mom is soo sweet.
The end is insane bc half way through when showing the paint swatches I thought the house almost looks done, like if you have your floors and stains picked out and they’re ready to go - like you said - it’s progressing so fast. I almost didn’t want to comment bc Ik allllllll the setbacks every step of the way and it feels like everything is going right, but the way you put it at the end, we have to move past our anxieties and just bc there have been setbacks or lawsuits lol in the past doesn’t mean they’re bound to happen, or doesn’t mean that we can’t handle inconveniences when they happen bc they’re just a part of life. Expect the unexpected & learn & grow & deal, but also be optimistic and enjoy the highs and good moments and the progression towards a better you/ more finished house 🥹🥹🥹 love you so much Morgan 🤍🫶 so happy for you & your growth :)
I wanna red barn!
So at 43 I have mastered a few things, Girl Math and Girl Reality  _ Girl Reality if you look hot on film camera at ANY point, you are hot in real life.  And you Morgan have and DO look hot at many many times in all weight forms of your body (so sad but most girls I know myself at one point too) our depression is directly related on how we feel about about ourselves physically. So take the photo your HOT
Gosh it’s beautiful 😍
YAS! It looks soooooo goood
i still don’t understand how morgan’s dad didn’t find the previous contractor suspicious
I loveeeeee the red!!! Everything is coming together so beautifully. I look forward to every video, Morgan you are living my absolute dream!
Okay girl you didn't have to make me cry at 1:30 on a Tuesday 😭💖
Can anyone tell me what the lawsuit was about if she shared it publicly? For some reason I am blanking. Idk if I missed it somehow or I am just having mild memory loss. My grandmother passed away and I’ve been a little out of it for awhile.
i feel like painting a barn red has to be a peak career highlight for a painter
Well it was 2:20 on a Wednesday for me. 😭😭😭  Let's get them hills! Laugh like a psycho trudging back up those valleys!  It def comes and goes in waves.....the tide always changing to weather our souls into what they're meant to be.   As always I luv watching your journey....hills and valleys, showing your true self's authenticity in it all.   So far my hill today was being off of work, free to do whatever with this awesome autumn day. My valley so far was trudging a dead gopher found drowned in my cats water to the woods to leave as an offering to nature first thing upon awakening. 🙃🙄   Much luv to you and your fam, sweetpea!
The workers were so sweet sharing tamales with you ❤
also THE RED BARN LOOK SO GOOD
i love your blurb about men. it's true. that team you got there is a beautiful group of what seems to be amazing men. they do exist 🥰
Omg I’m off work sick today and I literally opened youtube and said to myself ‘I really wanna watch a Morgan vlog where is sheeee’ and you blessed us today I couldn’t be happier
Damn, this vlog hit different today. Seeing you and your crew happy and, as always, saying the exact thing that I didn't know I needed or wanted to hear, but was very much welcomed. Thank you for sharing ❤ p.s. the quick shots of the Polaroids are my favorite thing.
You said you included the ending because you don't know when to stop, but I think that was a lovely way to end the video. I'm sure a lot of people, like you, needed and deserved to hear that. Thanks you for sharing that.
Yay so happy for you <3
That barn is my new nails inspo
THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN TREES *#PLANTATREE*
what, wait! I didn't think Morgan was apart of an HOA, rough.
❤your truly blessed.
We love good men ❤
I want to watch all 6 seas of gg rn too 😂 life is just too much
Morgan should totes have a big Christmas party in the barn for the crew. they look so happy to see the progress! the earth has blessed her with the best dudes.
Mom: “hope we didn’t get in your way!” Morgan: “right in the smack center of the shot” Mom: “I know, dad has no clue”  Re 👏🏽 La 👏🏽 Ta 👏🏽 Ble 👏🏽
Now you need a big red dog 😂😂😂😂
"This is the vlog that never ends, it goes on and on my friend" lol  Love the vlogs!  Don't stop!
The red barn is SO pretty against the greens of the trees and grass. It's going to look stunning in snow!
loving the coutry music with the beautiful moments happening in your life , idk , it's just wholesome and im so happy for you!!
The red barn with the fall tress!!🥰🥰
Im proud of you Morgan
Awww, I loved the ending so much. And I can relate. Thank you for your vulnerability, Morgan!  P.S. Men are awesome. And your Mom makes me laugh so much! 😂
Morgan you are gorgeous! Your house and barn are looking so good! ❤
I'm glad you uploaded. You always make me laugh. I'm so excited about the barn. 🫶🏻💜🫶🏻💜
Morgan,  I am so happy for you.  The barn turned out beautiful.  Your home is coming together and you will have it finished before you know it.  What a great group of guys you have around you.  You are glowing with happiness.  I love seeing that.
Yes!!!! I love that you’re making amazing content
It looks so so good!!! And you look fab too. Loving the hair cut! Now when are Morgan and Lucas going to come out as being official??? Hehe 🤪
omg the red barn with the fall leaves on that tree.....so gorgeous! <3
Morgan keep doing what you are doing! Thanks for making my day I always look forward to watching your videos 😊
This barn looks stunning with all the fall Colorado colors. I hope there is a collage of all the Polaroids of everyone who built it (barn and home) along with you ❤️
This episode was brought to you by the letter R: red, revamp, revive, renew, remake, redesign, recreate, rise up, right, rejuvenate, reconnect, remember, refresh, restart, regain.  Yes queen.  The barn looks amazing.
This is definitely the happiest I've seen you in a YouTube video in a minute, Morgan! I'm so excited for you and your house! Your barn is stunning! God Bless you, sister.
Morgan please do some more research on BetterHelp before using them as a sponsorship. Their therapists only have to take one class to be ‘certified’ and they were just fined $7.4 million for selling clients sensitive information. Promoting bad therapy is irresponsible and could cost someone their life. Please do better!
Morgan renovating for 5 years makes me feel better about taking 9 months
❤
Love the support from the guys
omg is it a possibility you’ll be in your house by Christmas 🥺 or at least new years 😭 i’m so happy to see the progress on the house. you look beautiful as always morgan 🤍
Love you to pieces Morgan ❤💕‼️🥰💋
Hey ! Love your content and your personnality and person ! Keep going Morgan ❤ You are gorgeous and a strong women 😊
23:48 I relate so much. But I just have to take it day by day. Thank you.🙂
Horizontal, not vertical 😂😂 but same, same….
I miss Morgan bae😫🫶🏽
When you read that quote.. it hit me deep. That’s exactly how I’ve always felt, but could never truly express it into words. When you read something like that, it makes you feel so understood. So, thank you Morgan ♥️
The red barn looks so good!!! I love these updates so much. I get so excited when I get a notification that you uploaded 🎉
Awww the barn painter has the most beautiful smile!! ❤
Been loving watching this house transformation and seeing Morgan also transform along the way. She bought this house a month before I gave birth to my first born and he’s now almost 2 1/2. I remember saying “I can’t wait to see the empty house tour video” thinking it would be before he turned 1. I’m now currently 23 weeks pregnant with my second child and literally praying she has her house done by the time I have my daughter in February. Sending nothing but good vibes and energy her way. 🫶🏻
My therapist, from better help, literally told me the words a scarred child would need to hear. "You are safe." And I tear up as I write this because it is still hard to believe. That last thing you read really hit as well. Love you girl, continue to grow you beautiful flower you. 🌻
Morgan I know this has been such a journey for you and I can NOT imagine how hard this is for you. My life has also been such a challenge. I want to say that your videos are such a good point for people to see someone who is authentically true to their issues. Someone who can show not everything is perfect and wonderful in life (especially on YT). As much as our issues are WAY different your authentic- ness and true self is very helpful for me personally as sometimes it's very hard to be in such a rough spot alone. You are a stranger and I'll probably never meet you but I want you to know that I appreciate all you do for this channel and I CAN NOT WAIT to see this place!
I love how your workers are soo invested, and how happy they get seeingn your vision come to life... great job Morgan the  barn is beautiful 😍
So proud of you Morgan!!! I'm on a similar journey right now, with ADHD and darkness and relearning self love. You're an inspiration <3 keep it up girly
Wow the red barn is just AMAZING 😍 made me tear up how far you’ve come 🥹
Why didn't you start on the house first?
AHHHHHH!!! Im literally screaming!! Im so freaking excited for all the progress it looks absolutely stunning 🤩 💕
I LOVE the barn! Even more beautiful than I imagined!! You’re absolutely glowing Morgan! So happy for you!❤
The red barn is IT!!! That’s the hot goss ❤
My GOSH Morgan, you’re absolutely glowing these days. I need a face routine or make up reveal. Whatever you’re doing, it’s working ❤
It’s a good day when we get a Morgan blog!  You are beautiful Morgan!
I knew today was gonna be a good day when I saw you post 💕
Do yourselfs a favour and just skip to the painting bits unless you fancy more moaning.
I literally just subscribed this morning and watched your last video hoping an update would be uploaded soon!!! 🌷☀️✨
Hills and Valleys - Tauren Wells 🙌🏻🎶
Share the photos!! Take the photos!! <3 You are beautiful!!
The ladder wobbling was giving me anxiety
I was literally thinking about you yesterday and how I’ve been missing your videos !
Morgan you are a beautiful young lady with a beautiful soul.  Don't ever let anyone tell you who you are.  The barn and the house are looking amazing so keep doing what you're doing because it's working
Omg the construction guys are so nice, bringing tamales and pan dulce
you are so pretty
MORGAN! Your videos mean the world to me! I was literally having a crisis over finding my new normal all last month. My mom passed away a year ago and now I'm ready to move on, move out of the house and just put effort into my life again but it feels like such a large task! Let's find our new normal together once we get out of this valley <3
Shout out to the good men in the world!!
It looks amazing!  Yay!
❤
I just adore you. Your the kind of chick that would make the best kind of bestie. I love so much what you read out. It too resonated with me waaay to much. One quick thing I keep trying to say to myself daily is  'don't look back cause you ain't going that way" Sending huge love from New Zealand. If you've ever heard of my teeny tiny country haha. ❤❤❤
Awwww i love you so much ! You’re a great human Morgan !❤
Purrrrr❤
Check the color in all lights and corners of rooms, cause it may look horrific in some spots. Agreeable grey is a pretty safe bet for large areas
Ugh, a better help sponsorship??? You’re better than shilling those scam artists
the post you read at the end made me cry. it fits very well
Girl better help has 3 major lawsuits that you should check out before promoting them anymore!!!!!!
it's giving "yee-haw"
My great grandparents had a red barn. I love it!!!
I get it completely. I feel like the last 4 years have been such a struggle. If things were to change I don’t know if I would know what to do. How to react, or would I even know? I’m so so happy things are going great for you! I love your and your families videos. Sometimes the right men need to come into your life and they found you!
You genuinely bring so much light and joy anywhere you are and i’m so grateful and happy you choose to share your journeys with us thank you Morgan we need more youtubers like you 🫶
The barn is BEAUTIFUL, Morgan! You made it all the way here 🥹
happy for you love ❤️‍🔥 you look so happy too i jus love you girlie 🫶 you deserve this 🥰 who else think she need a llama or something tho??? im fr 😂 or some type of exotic animal would be so cool nbs
I love the fall colors of the leaves that surround the red barn. At the 18 minute mark the yellow fall leaves next to the barn should be a picture. To me it would be a great example of how something was once ugly can be turned into something beautiful. You should make a copy of that slide.  Love it.
You have a deeply sensitive soul Morgan and thats why it was deeply hurt. My tiny advise to you, which I also try to follow, is to make careful choices. Take your time and do the thing that feels absolutely right for you. Not kind of right, not close to what you want, EXACTLY what you want. In that way, you protect your heart. And take your time with everything! Love you and thank you for sharing what so many of us are going through ❤
Yes we NEED men.  F those idiots acting like we don't.
🤍
I NEED to know how you do your slicked back bun or ponytail!!! Also, I’m so excited for you!!! Things are coming along so fast!!!🎉🎉🎉
aww the barn is a beauty! loving all the progress!!!
Aw Morgan congratulations it looks so great. ❤ Edit: Holy crap i needed those words you read more than you know. It was my birthday yesterday - i spiralled. It was my year in review. I spent majority of the day crying. Newly single mum, my ex of 15 years moved in with a younger model 2 days after leaving me. I keep telking myself I'm better without him. But it hurts. My daughter whos 8 brought home her creative writing book from school yesterday, she had written an elaborate sweet story about going to the beach with her dad, step mum and new sep sisters (shes an only child). It was so bitter sweet. I had ached for another child so she had a friend but my ex said no. Now he has 3 step children.  Okay had to poor my heart out to strangers on the internet. Vent over xo Everything will be ok
Wow the red barn 😍 things are coming together! This has been a journeyyyy to watch
omg the pan dulce 🥺
Morgan you are living my dreams, i am so so proud of you. keep up the amazing work!
The red is the perfect shade for the barn. Excellent choice!
Girlll why do you keep moving out and moving in 😭😭😭 that’s like your brand now😭😭
❤❤
It’s ok Morgan x
Red barn is beautiful!  Thank you for sharing your journey with us!
excited to see the house fully done! it's going so fast 😍
I love morgan Adams more than i love most people
The barn looks amazing! You should be very proud of all of the progress that you've made with your home! I don't know you personally but I'm proud of your accomplishments!❤
Morgan never fails to look like such a babe
I was having a real shite morning so far, I'm so happy the queen posted <3 gonna grab some brekkie and enjoy this. :)
MORGAN <3 ^-^
Haha I love the red but missing the white❤😂
Picturing how beautiful your home is going to be. I love the barn, and love watching your home come to life.
I overshare all the time!  Your house and barn are beautiful! Red was perfect for the barn!❤
The girls that say men suck is there fault…. They have bad taste or attract the wrong men cuz of the way the girl is. I’ve always had great men around me but I’m a strong cute women lol
It looks so good!!!! ❤
The barn is ❤‍🔥!
My actual lifelong dream is to own a red barn and I'm happily living vicariously through you for now considering how much this series has scared me off from my life long dream entirely 😀
Man ihope when this is all over we still get to see luckas (sp?) He is such a sweet guy!@
Love when you post!!!! just know that red was the best decision 😍😍😍😍
I can't express how much I look forward to the house update videos! My favorite youtube content rn
I’m also a mom who doesn’t make bread and in fact gave my son an Eggo waffle with PB this morning 😂
I love the red barn!!
I love seeing Morgan pop up on my page and I immediately run to get my coffee and watch what's new with her. Thank you Morgan for my morning coffee videos!
That shit scared me.. and it's just a school bus... I ain't got no kids 😂😂😂😂 Morgan is HILARIOUS 😅❤❤
💜💜💜💜💜
Not just MEN but BLUE COLLAR MEN are the best kind of men 🩵
I swear your house reno is my Roman Empire 😂😅 RAN here from instagram stories 🏃‍♀️☠️
So excited about all the progress with the property!!!!
So happy for you! 🤍
Morgan, you 100% made the right choice! It looks stunning!
Looooove seeing you thriving girl. You deserve nothing less. Seeing you in videos brings me such joy because you're so upbeat and charismatic ❤❤❤ loooots of love from Colombia 🇨🇴
This is nothing but pure JOY ♥
Not better help…
What a happy ending to my evening when I saw a notification that you posted a vid! ILYSM Morgan <3 Ur such a positive QUEEN
OMG! I always say rubber cement is my favorite "weird' smell and NOBODY ever knows what I'm talking about!!
I am living for the red barn!!!  ❤❤❤
how many fresh starts can there be in one year? asking for a friend ofc.
Seeing a non-working barn red just feels...off to me.
Literal conversation of me and my husband when we are driving back to the house. Me: babe, should I watch the video now or do you want me to wait until we are at home?  Babe: wait till we get home she’s doing the one with the house still right?  Me: yes, an the barn ❤  Literally, five minutes away from home. Can’t wait to watch it.  Lol 😂
YESSSS MORGANNNNNNNNN   I haven't started it yet but I AM READY. The blunt is rolled, fuzzy socks ON, and it's ACTUALLY cold today. Then you come on this here Youtubes and bless US?!?!       Today is a good day!!  EDIT: This video made me realize how bittersweet it will be when it's all done... Baby you better build a pool or maybe even a carousel? I mean it wouldn't be too off brand lmao. Love u babes
It's the "a bitch that likes to be vertical" while making a horizontal line in the air for me HAHAH gotta love Morgan❤
That's the hot goss! 🙌
