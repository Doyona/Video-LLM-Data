Messi is the goat
Israel said that Paris Saint - Germain are bad at playing in Israel 🇮🇱
Farmers league ffs
The weight of pass reminds me of Barca vs Chelsea when Messi assisted Iniesta. It was so perfectly weighted that Iniesta just rolled the ball past Peter Cech
if suarez moved to psg msn would be wonderful
🇵🇸
Schoolboy defending. Not fit for Champions League. Who let them in.
Anybody gonna highlight the fact that this team is NOT from Europe and are playing in a EUROPEAN COMPETITION?!  Sigh
PENALTY!!!!!!! He out done the keeper and he took him down.
free Palestine
All credit due to Maccabi Haifa, gave PSG a proper game, could’ve easily been a 2-0 maybe even a 3-0 win for them on a different day. In the end PSG showed the quality they possess. Too many 1 on 1’s that were wasted by PSG but managed to get the W.
🤮🤮
I know neymar has a bad rep but tha was 100% a peno!
What’s the record??? I don’t get it… poor goal anyways…
🇵🇸
So a European competition allows a middle Eastern Non-Non-european team play in its competition? Not being hateful but can anyone explain how that works? Do certain Israeli teams have dual-continental status? Maybe we could have some Hongkong based teams in the Uefa-CL Next season to add a bit or spice or a couple more Patsy-teams!
Free Palestine
Is that team from Europe? I swear it’s the Middle East.
I don't even think I could do anything but clap if Messi scored against my team. Just the greatest.  Big props to Tjaron Chery too! He had a great game
I’m disgusted that uefa allows this disgusting nation to allow their teams to play yet don’t allow Russian teams
Messi is far more of a team player than Ronaldo. May even be a better player.
Free Palestine
Psg can’t defend in the air
Can everybody see the difference between Messi and Ronaldo now ?
🐐
Thee amount of incredible passes M’bappe receives and misses on a daily basis is pathetic. The 1 on 1 chances that he had in this game and even in other games as well - absolutely soils it 🤦🏻‍♂️ The amount of money this guy gets and people make him out to be the next Ronaldo. Messi or Ronaldo would’ve easily scored them back in the day, even Haaland would’ve scored them. Don’t get me wrong - he’s a great player, but his finishing isn’t that great I don’t think. I think his finishing is over rated. M’bappe will never be as good as Messi or Ronaldo - no chance.
Maccabi 💩
Mbappe's shooting is genuinely unbelievable at times.
Messi 👑
Why is haifa in the champions league lol. Not many fan shots the ultras defo the worst hooligans
That pass from messi was perfect
Argentina are going to win the World Cup. Messi is more of a threat when he plays as a playmaker than goal scorer.
What were Mbappe and Neymar tryna do in the first half? Dribble past the keeper or something? 😂
"Neymar goes down.."  IMAGINE MY SHOCK
Why teams from Israel and Turkey take part to the European Champions League?
Messi Mbappe Neymar
Mbappe is just all hype isnt he cant take penalties cant score a one on one.
Mbappe goal is better than it looks... That is precise and amazing technique. So we have Mbappe.. who is the next Christiano and  Lionel?
Haifa played really well offensively to be fair
I never knew Israel was in Europe?
If messi is in top form like tonight he will win champions league
Maccabi Haifa? That’s a team in Palestine right?
Wow…..
Why are war criminals allowed to play?
Neymar has a rare talent and he is unpredictable as defenders never knows what he will do...
Neymar miles off side
Mbaps earlier missed chances are why they won’t win the champs league, they aren’t used to decent competition in the french league.
Credit to Haifa they played brilliant considering they playing one of best teams in world
Mbappe is pish. 1st touch and control is dreadful. Only scores due to pace.
Messi Mbappe Neymar > Messi Neymar Suarez. Change my mind
There good too watch PS5 but defensively I ust think the better teams  will punish them.
Mbappe is the best player in the world right now, what a beast.
Can someone explain to me how maccabi are in the ucl as they aren’t even remotely in Europe??
PSG are absolutely wide open and will be picked apart again by a quality team.
Amazing to see a in the Maccabi Haifa field Jewish, Christian and Muslim players whi play together harmoniously. The rest of the Middle East has a lot to learn.
If neymar never left barca and stayed with messi he surely would have been the Third greatest after cr7/messi
Mbappe is no different to Theo Walcott ….. fast, has so many chances to score and poor decision making

Messi is the 🐐
Mbappe is overrated
There's just no passion where's the celebration the commentators just seem dead 🤣
What record?
Messi just quietly going about his business. Ronnie could learn a thing or two.
How are Israel allowed to field a team. Even if they weren't a murderous brutal terrorist state regime,  there still not in Europe! So who else will take part in the competition next year? - Putin XI, Isis United,  Cartel FC
The opposing team played very well but donnaruma was on fire
Messi breaking records while fake Ronaldo is rotting at Man U 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Messi just caresses it inch perfect into his path. Best player ever
Well in Messi, beat the Israelis did it for Palestine!
They should occupy the Asian tournament while they're at it
Uefa don't mess with the zohan
What record did he break?
Brilliant game from both the teams
Another match for the referees and var
I just love how the Ronaldo clown club doesn’t rush over to these videos anymore after Messi shows that he can change his play to be world class at not just finishing but assisting too. And Penaldo has been dropped.
Mbappe still makes the difference.
Mbappe is so frustrating, the amount of times he could slide Messi or Neymar in but he doesn’t have the football IQ of either of them. He also misses so many chances.
Messi absolutely is the GOAT- don't get me wrong, but it bothers me so much at how messi fans force the compliments on him. The top 6 comments on this video are all talking about his good through ball- when veratti literally played an almost identically good through ball to mbappe. He was astonishing, but now he really is past his best and I think it's time to stop forcing the comments, trying to clutch onto any little good thing he does and claim it as best in the world material.
4:14 can admit I got a bit excited when he was on the ball going forward like this  🧙
👍
Mbappe is such a wasteful footballer.
Macabi haifa played really well in fairness
Another tap in for Pessi lmao 😂
Maccabi Haifa are a world class team
Everyone can come together and say they were so excited when Haifa took the lead.
Vamos! 🇵🇸
Meeeesssssssssiiiiiiìii 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Abdoulaye Seck daaal yow do dem Coupe du Monde, tactiquement il a ete nul !
why is this team from a terrorist state allowed to play in european competition
If mbappe can keep his cool on and off the pitch MNM might be a real threat
Psg miss so many chances it's unreal
Messi should be having at least 95 short passing now like xavi and iniesta. He literally is that good...
Unbelievable stuff by PSG. However Maccabi created a lot of great chances too, I still think PSG's defence will let them down in this competition as usual
Why is a team from Israel playing in Europe?
This was embarrassing.
I don't think anyone realises how good vitinha is 👍
Getting nowhere near the trophy yet again
Mbappe is the most overrated player I've seen all he his I'd fast he's to fast for himself tricks himself absolute bang average
I didn't know Israel was in Europe
Our first goal in the competition for 2 decades the first in my lifetime. What an honour this was to experience.
Which part of Europe was this played 🤔
Hakimi booed by fans cos he supports Palestine. Disgusting behaviour from a disgusting society
Buy your way to the top ,football has lost its soul
Why are we allowing israeli teams in Europe? They are not in Europe and should not be part of European official sports. Otherwise Morocco should be allowed in as well. Secondly since when do we allow an apartheid state aka Israel to get a free pass
Highlights show nothing of the work Veratti did.
Props to Maccabi, they definitely went toe-to-toe with PSG for a while. As a Celtic fan I can sympathise with losing to a big team despite a good performance. Maybe we'll both get some points out of the away games haha
Too much fire power 💥🔥
PSG finishing was poor
Its all between mbappe and halaand now these two are gonna hold the torch now
THATS WHY HES THE GOAT , THE GOAT
3:05 this guy is a baller ! That touch into kick ups was too smooth
Some will say psg are amazing going forward, but they are so frail everywhere else. They won’t win the champions league. Not even close
Haaland clear of mbappe
Palestine 1.... PSG 3
10:35 Mbappe or not, who does that? Bad miss
Should be a pen
Mbappe needs perfect his finishing, he can easily score 50 goals in a season, PSG defending still lacking thou
Sorry, why is there an Israeli team playing in a EUROPEAN competition??? I'm not the best at geography but last time I checked, Israel was somewhere in the Middle East, Lol. It just goes to show the special privilege some get.
Israel is in Europe?
Farmers league champions 2022-2023
Someone explain how Neymar didn't get a pen there
I have to say if this psg front three keep connecting like they have this season they will beat anybody in the world.
Mbappe is pathetically overrated. 😂
how is a team no where near europe in a european football competition?
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Even after playing 1000 senior games and Messi can still play like this. There will never be another Messi
PSG to win CL?  Erm no
Messi the 🐐 respect to maccabi played well
Can someone tell me why thats not a neymar penalty?
Macabbi Haifa is in Europe? Mm
Haifa put up a very good fight
haifia is so clapped
What record did this one break?  If it's in the title, it's gotta be in the vid :P
MNM 👍
Thanks Bt Sport. it's Awsome. Anyway i stand with palestine!
If PSG actually built the team around Messi, they would literally be impossible to beat, even Liverpool and Manchester City would struggle
Messi the best playmaker of all time. As well as dribbler and goal scorer
Messi please come back to Barca 🥹🥹🥹
Free Palestine
Psg are not a team, the front 3 are selfish players especially Neymar & Mbappe.  The club is just a joke, and will NEVER win the big one
My question is: What Neymar wanted to do after Messi`s shot?
Accept it ronaldo fanboys
Nobody talking about that ball to neymar from verratti
Haven't heard the name Tjaronn Chery since he was at QPR
Messi still ruined his team's chances of progressing against his biggest rival last season
Am I the only one that thinks that Neymar has grown up a bit
@ 0:33 why didn't mbappe take the long range shot!? it was perfect
Neymar, Messi, & Mpabé = Trouble
cherry on top
The weight on Messi's tax evasion skill is immaculate.
Messi n neymar shows game after game that they are top class !!! Gazelle of mpabee doesn’t even know how to dribble a defender but again lucky to score !!!!
Messi makes it look so easy lol
When celtic won the European cup ,all their players were from three miles of the city center,the players today are all mercenaries there's no loyalty ,I don't want to watch footballers who he have no loyalty or heart for their football club ,FOOTBALL TO DAY IS JUST A GAME OF MONEY,
Free Palestine!
PSG made this game look so hard.
PSG won, what an upset
FREE PALESTINE
It’s a disgrace having a team from Israel in a European football tournament. Politics aside, get rid of them.
no way PSG are winning the champions league
Messi's pass to mbappe WOW i see why they call him the lil magician now 💯
The records:  1) First player to score in 18 different seasons of the Champions League (Karim could level if returns from injury)  2) Scored against 39 different teams in the UCL
Is Isreal in Eureope? How is this team eligible for a European competition?
Love to see Maccabi get slapped :)
Not as one sided as the scoreline suggests this game
Psg winning no champions league
There is no end to what Messi can do with a ball, also his little turns and dribbles and one touch passing with Neymar is reminding me of 2009-2012 Messi, GOAT
What was Neymar doing (throwing his foot) when Messi shot for his goal?
Heavy hitters!! Spain 🇪🇸 Brazil 🇧🇷 Argentina 🇦🇷 France 🇫🇷. As a Selecao fan, it's a good place to be...
Messi doing Messi things 😍
Just got a feeling PSG defence are gonna bottle it this season again
Why has no one ended Neymars career? I would happily watch someone break his legs… not a role model for young footballers coming through…
The 2013-19 Messi is coming out for WC and I can't funking wait to see it.
4:21 Great sportsmanship between defenders.. Mukiele is the first one to appreciate Cornud's clearance that stopped him from scoring an open goal
This could be the best front 3 ever

PSG is a retirement home for aging superstars
messi neymar mbappe all scoring again this team and city now wanna make it unfair with their money🤣  Messi’s assist tho is a strikers wet dream of a pass

Didn't watch this game but seen most of psg matches doesn't vitinha look like a class signing

every psg game, MESSI, NEYMAR, MBAPPE Blah blah blah
Messi making Mbappe job way easier and making it look so simple
Farmer's league pessi 🤣
MNM vs MSN vs BBC - who wins?
I think so much credit is due to Maccabee Haifa for managing to hold their ground for so long against a seemingly unstoppable psg and for the incredible atmosphere they made
Is it me or is mbappe very wasteful
1:00 2:35
What's wrong with the neymar celebration goal? Why was it a yellow card lol
Only three-one that’s embarrassing
How was the goalkeeper on Neymar not a penalty?
The M&M combo
Money team
Messi and Mbappe are an amazing underrated duo
I'm glad PSG won tbh. Israel is not in Europe!
Still they will not win the CL this season…. Teams like PSG should not exist…
Israel is in Europe?
Pretty tough game unlike scoreline
I fear when mbappe loses a bit if pace he won't be a great
Vitinha played well
Better than rondog who can’t even get first team football for a finished united team 😂😂😂
Free Palestine
That’s why I’m psg on fifa 😂 the only reason . Thanks mbappe
What record? Scoring in the most consecutive UCL seasons?
i dont think people realise how many good passes Mbappe gets and misses
I’m not sure if anyone else realised, but Messi had GOAT on his sleeve 🐐
Ronaldo cannot pass like messi does. He’s a goal machine but that’s it. He doesn’t come close to messi pass range vision and dribbling ability. 🤷🏽‍♂️
PSG must be such a toxic team to play in
Messi or Ronaldo, let's enjoy them both while we can! Their era is nearly over, with Mbappe and Halaand around the corner.
Why do psg always get the longest highlights???££££££
Messi passes is too good dangerous👍
Messi is too much
Haaland on another level to Mbappe. Haaland is a generational talent, Mbappe is a slightly better Rashford
The mighty Macabbi!  🤣🤣🤣🤣
In all my years of supporting football, through thick and thin, through blood sweat tears suppporting my team and just generally being a football fan, i have never heard of macabia hafia lol 🐄🐄🐄
Still not going to win the CL.
Messi fans unite lmao
Messi not quite as good as he was but still sublime.
Messi should hit the balls harder in front of the goal. He will score more
He broke a record against WHO?? 💀💀
Messi to win 10 Ballon D’or 🐐
Great Win for PSG in Palestine!  🇵🇸
MNM 🥵
Psg didn't dominate possession lol
Trio of hell! Messi is the ambassador of football after zidane. Honorable mention : neymar. The most complete forward: mpappe.  PSG has monopoly on genius of footballers.
Mbabbe is extremely overrated
MNM or  Mnessmar which is better?
Neymar the rat trying to steal Messi’s goal. Lucky he didn’t touch it for offside
Neymar is having a stormer this season 🔥
Henry would of buried both chances.  Dont ever compare both of them. Am a liverpool fan too. Henry was something else. Scary
Neymar's Top Quality Above The Rest
No Messi, no win. 1goal, 1pass worth of 3 goals. Can't believe he still makes those short explosive bursts and leaves everyone behind Really Joy to watch
PSG won but they had enough struggle in that match. That suggests that they won't be this season UCL winner.
Mbappe n neymar shoukda scored in the first half tho they tried being too fancy tryna skill the goalkeeper rather than just finishing and scoring
Neymar 🐐
Messi is only 14 goals away from beating Ronaldo's all time Champions league goal record so Ronaldo must be sweating.  Ronaldo is unable to add to his goal record this year so it gives Messi tut chance to catch up to him. I can see Messi scoring at least 7 Champions league goals this season. That's why Ronaldo was so desperate to leave United and join any club at all to get into the Champions league. By the end of this year there will probably be only 6 goals separating them. Ronaldo's champions league goal record is his most treasured record of all and Messi is on tut brink of reaching it
PSG secure a 3-1 win against Maccabi whom scored first in what look like a open game,with PSG missing easy chances on the break.
They're the best three forwards in time world, as potent as Neymar, Messi, and Suarez used to be for Barcelona. Messi is finally adapting to his new team
"buhhhh... the champ-yuns!"
05:23 what a pass from Verratti
All of a sudden all these fake Messi fans back to suck on he’s knob now that psg have better form. He was good last year but being in a new country for the first time in basically his whole life deffinently did impact his on field performance but overall  psg and Messi had some very good and entertaining games
Didn't macaabi haifa fans say we hate arabs? Now they got beat by Arab owners.
Why are Russian teams banned from the UCL yet teams from Israel (a country not even in Europe) allowed despite their 55 year long illegal occupation of Palestine? Rank hypocrisy. Let them all in or none.
Once again PSG look bang average. Zero chance they'll ever win the UCL, just a load of individuals grouped together will never be a team in a million years
🇵🇸
The BT and the queen of England are only after money
Why is no1 talking about that number 10 😳
Messi still the GOD no flicks tricks stepovers just does everything simple. Mbappe should be cleaning his boots he might learn something
What record did the Messi goal break? Or is it clickbait?
Finally. Messi is the MIT.  GOAT 🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏

Wtf is this new interface for scrolling through the video? It's so slow. Can't even click the screen to play

Vitinha and Chery are really good players. They played so well and their keeper made really good saves. Although the team lost, the team did play really good football. Hope they win against Celtic
i love messi so much
Neymar has a goal contribution in every game he’s played in best player on the planet right now
😂😁😁😁😁😁
I like how no mention is made in the hightlights of what record is broken...
PSG are amazing going forward, however, not so good at the back. A defensive team will be able to beat PSG getting goals on a counter-attack.
I only come to see the first goal.
Cherey was actually really impressive 👌👌
Messi, neymar and mbappe we really are seeing something incredible here
This game was actually so much closer than the score line suggests, they are 100% not winning this, Stick to stat padding in the farmers league.
Neymar is hated
Mbappe is so amazing.
The Messi Show 🤔
Really good performance from Messi! Another record broken! 🐐 Great result!
It's maccabi Haifa relax.
What is an Israeli team doing in a European competition? last time I checked they were middle eastern.
5:14
name smth more accurate than Messi's through balls. I'll wait...
Neymars left foot is clinical
I really don't understand how Mbappe got given motm over Messi
CLICKBAIT... WHAT RECORD?  CAN AT LEAST SAY WHAT IT IS FFS
Messi, Neymar and Mbappe strike again!
watch the fanboys say the team they played are actually really good😂
against who?
Did the commentator say it's there first goal in this competition for 20 years ?!?!? How's that even possible
Title says Messi Goal Breaks ANOTHER Record! Um, doesn't mention that in the video, so what record did Messi break?
This is why Ronaldo wanted to join a Champion's league club

The assist from Messi is beautiful. The greatest player to ever play this sport.
Mbappe's finish was goat like 🔥
Can someone explain to me why a team from IsraHELL which is blatantly in the continent of Asia, taking part in a European competition🤔🇸🇩
Always find it stupid isrealie teams are in the UCL
Why are Israeli team in the CL ? They're not in Europe, pathetic allowing them in.
Mbappes selfishness gets worder by the day
Mbappe is quality but that pace makes him next level. Impossible for defenders to deal with.
we need mpappe and haaland to go to real and barca
Thank God that israeli team lost. The Muslim PSG players made sure of that.
Apartheid states should be banned from football.
The weight on Messi passes is immaculate. Mbappe didn’t even have to break stride and the defender was completely removed from the equation
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Messi is like a ninja with those passes
Chim CHimmeney Chim Chimmeney Tjaronn Chery
Goal no. 2 for PSG could have been saved
I am a Neymar fan but look at the opponents number 10,he was unstoppable on this match..I don’t know his name even but he played better than Neymar, Messi or Mbappe
The two records Messi broke tonight are: 1-Scored against most teams in champions league (39) now 1 ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo 2-Scored in 18 different consecutive champions league campaigns now 1 ahead of Karim Benzema
Is that like 20 games in a row that neymar's made a goal contribution?
Mbappe runs a bit like Ronaldo
Why did neymar get booked for that celebration 🤣
Ishowspeeds reaction to messis goals was jokes😂😂😂
PSG shitter than I thought. Why does Messi always try and pass his shots into the goal these days? Bit more power would be good instead of trying to roll it past the gk
If I’m honest I don’t really care if they are or aren’t, but I’m curious how come that team are in the UCL when they’re from Israel?

This why Ronaldo wanted to leave us sorry Ronaldo from united fan
MNM all score. Love to see it. If those 3 r on form theres gonna be a lot of goals for PSG
'1st goal in the competition for almost 20 years'   Course it comes against the French farmers
Wait so what Record did Messi break?

mbappe is the most selfish player i have ever seen
Messi been dominating since ps2 to ps5 🤯
Love how messi has ‘goat’ written on his sleeve 😂
Since when is Israel in Europe? Its closer to Africa.... Interesting.
What was the actual record he broke?
Should be banned to play in criminal , illegal and  stolen land. FiFA and Uefa are hypocrites.
PSG have a terrible defense
Now lemme tune in on united game…
He can beat Ronaldo record since Ronny in Europa League
Mmm Burp Eh?
Ambappe should learn there are other forwards too
This game was actually a lot closer than the scoreline suggests. PSG just had too much quality for Maccabi Haifa in the end.
Despite losing 1-3 Maccabi played some great football and should be proud of themselves
Unbelievable how psg was struggling to win the match once again !!!

Messi literally making this look like PES at this point

Messi who is apparently 'finished' has more Goals and Assists than prime Kevin De Bruyne this Season 🐐
Messi with full pre-season, no COVID, not missing league games:  1) Messi has been MOTM 8 times out of 10 games this season. 2) Top assister of 2022 across all top 5 leagues. 3) He has 5 goals and 8 assists in 10 games (just September!)  He means business this season 🔥 👀  The Copa America Champion and record 7 times Ballondor also becomes the first player in UCL to score against different 39 UCL teams, and 18th consecutive campaign.  Lionel Messi also becomes the player with the most recorded assists and goals, a sum of 1113. Ridiculous.
Psgs attacking trio on fire 🔥🔥🔥
Wait, can someone tell me why a team from Israel are in the champions league?
Messi, Neymar and Mbappe really clicking this season unstoppable 😳
This is the goat people, not a guy whos struggling to get into the starting eleven at manchester united. Even if messi only scores 15 goals this season hes still levels clear as he will provide plenty of chances and assists as a playmaker
Record, Goals,assist  are very simple     things in MESSI
Many people say that Messi creates chances and scores, while Ronaldo only scores, but Ronaldo is actually the 4th player with the most assists in history, behind Suarez, Muller, and Messi.
I wish Messi would just smash it into the roof of the net sometimes...
Sooooooooo... which record did he break?
Rumour has it that Messi is still waiting for Mbappe to pass him the ball .
Israel are only good at killing Palestinians
BORING… PSG will lose in the semis as always… BORING
mmn the new msn
Messis shooting has became so bad the past 2 seasons, he easily could’ve got 2 or 3 more
Messi breaking records again... What an absolute Legend 😏
Mbappe again too selfish and he doesnt even care   . Made a hard game for PSG not passing the ball early in the second half  . Not once but twice   . Fair play to Maccabi Haifa   , they played hard until the last minute   . What an atmosphere from the Maccabi Haifa supporters   !!!

mbappes sheer speed gives him so much more time to angle his body/decide what to do, he gets to the ball whole seconds before defenders when they're only metres away

Well played both teams, Maccabi Haifa were brilliant but PSG quality shone through in the end
Mbappe's skill and burst of pace very similar to Henry he reminds me of him a lot.
Mbappe reminds me of a young thiery Henry with that finish
Tap in against this hafi team .  messi the goat 😂 . benfica vs psg bring it on .
Haaland will likely break many of Messi’s and Ronaldo’s goal records, but this harms Ronaldo more than Messi. Because Messi is so much more than just goals. He’s a true artist.
Messi is much better than Ronaldo♥️
Why is an Israeli team in a UEFA competition. I'm sure Israel is a different continent

Seriously tho, want to rattle the public, asides the World Cup (could’ve gone to the final in 2014 if neymar never got injured) and not winning the ballon dor during the Messi and Ronaldo era, what puts neymar below ronaldinho?
