UPDATE 2/6/21: Braxton, I'm honored that you chose me for your Make-A-Wish. Your ceremony was absolutely beautiful buddy. Your family is so amazing. Everyone kept saying how I was your hero and how I positively affected your life, but you did that to me ten fold. You've inspired me to live the best life I can. You're family said green was your favorite color, so I wore green for you at your funeral. Save some treasure up in heaven for me! We miss you bud. Lets live our lives "Kicking Butt With Two T's" just like Braxton!   You can directly donate to Braxton's family with my link provided here: https://bit.ly/BraxtonWeidman  If you would like to take it to the next level feel free to donate to Make-A-Wish Foundation and help their amazing cause.

Nobody deserves this. Every child deserves to grow to be an adult alongside family and friends. He’ll be forever missed. Rest in peace beautiful boy ❤
Heart breaking
The amount of trolls in the comments is horrifying! If you think it's funny to laugh at a boy passing away, there is a special place in Hell for you. You wouldn't be laughing if someone you cared about was had the same fate. Have some empathy!
Honey, its ok to cry. Its ok to be crushed by this news. Its ok to not be ok. You were worthy of his adoration.
2 TT
You made me tear up man. You made his wish come true !
Rest and peace Braxton

Hey man. Just ignore the mean comments. They're just messing with you. May Braxton rest in peace.
You are human and your emotions are real, condolences to the family, and May he be in eternal glory!
Jake @DALLMYD thank you for making Braxton's wish come true!!! I've only recently found your page.  I read the description & watched both videos. But brother when you cried I lost it 😭. Thank you for being you Jake, don't ever change ❤❤❤
Hey Jake, i just watched the video where you hung out with Braxton and made his little world so much bigger and brighter,  im so sorry to see this video posted so soon afterwards 😢 ❤
4:08 weird face
May little Braxton rest in piece!!
Opened up his casket to take a 💩in it
This is so sad 😢
Jake, the world needs more people like you! Cleaning up the environment and making a difference in other’s lives. You brought much joy to Braxton! Keep up the good work!
How did he pass away 😔*pin
Rip):
It's okay Amer that means we love the god the poor kid like what happened to him 😔
You got a good heart Jake rip braaxtonn
Jake, I am new to your channel and I am so glad I did. I believe that everyone comes into our lives for a reason. Braxton I believe knew how huge your heart is. Your kind heart and great attitude showed him that there is a purpose for everyone. I have learned that even young kids will teach us adults to love and respect each other. He is watching over you now. Sometimes the strongest people come in little packages ❤❤ Rest In Peace Braxton
Jake 😢 Braxton knows that you are his favorite YouTuber he is looking down on you
Braxton right now: 👹🔥😭🔥👹
Funny af death
You have such a great heart. Glad I found your channel.
I come back to watch this video from time to time to remind myself that life is precious and it can be taken from us at any moment. R.I.P Braxton. We all miss you and we all know you’re treasure hunting up there in heaven 🕊️
We miss you Braxton🙏
He actually murdered Braxton and is using cancer as a reason for a cover up
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
People pass away, but you just gotta realize that he got his wish to do some treasure hunting with you and he's happy and it's sad to have somebody that you have so much fun with pass away. I feel your pain.  I'm very sorry😢
Very hilarious situation
I love you
tHanks for taking us along, we all can learn how to be better people each day when we see a video like this.
The reason why his face is so red is because he smeared Braxton's guts all over it
Just started watching your videos. Watch the foundation video first than I came cross this one. So sorry thought Baxton had the day of is life. Please take some time for yourself.
He's in the trashcan now lol
Rest in peace Braxton god has a plan for you in heaven

A real true humanitarian, Jake. To make this little boy's Make-A-Wish come true for the little time he had left, absolutely beautiful. And it was even more beautiful that Braxton wanted to go treasure hunt and clean up our bodies of water with Jake. Jake, if there were more people like you in the world, it would be a much better place. ❤
❤🧡💚💜💙
Sometimes all we can do in a person's life is show them something they never thought they could do on their own. I feel your pain because it's a child who lost his life. But it was a beautiful thing what you did for him. And even if his life was short it was impacted greatly by your actions. And that young boy's life is going to inspire many now that you have shared the experience with the rest of us. God bless you for who you are. 🖤🩶🖤🩶 RIP Braxton may God watch over you and your family.
Rest in power
😞😞😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥹
THAT IS SO SAD I WISH I COULD HELP YOU OUT MEN
😢😪😭😭😢😥

I don’t easily tear up but when hearing about kids that go through this I start crying as well, it’s so painful to hear about, a kid has so much life in front of them, so much potential and then something like this can just take that all away😢

The worst feeling is a loss of a child, my condolences to the Wideman family, may he rest in peace.

My friend, it's so tough when a little one passes before their time. When I worked at Walt Disney World I met so many wonderful Make a Wish Families. Braxton clearly made a wonderful choice for his wish.
RIP
I have no words. My heart goes out to you sir. Exactly why me? You were blessed to be the wish.
This kills me. I have 2 boys who have been diagnosed with cancer… this really kicks me in the gut.
You have a special son and you all made some perfect memories.  I hope you all are doing OK after Braxton's passing.
Our family friend passed away years ago from a brain tumor at 40 years which too young, but 9 y/o is just tragic. My nephew is also called Braxton around the same age.. My condolences to the family. I'm sorry for your loss. RIP
You are a good person Jake
Aww bro love you man. God bless you. 🙌🏾  wishing you all the very best.  The boy was beautiful.

Dallmyd, you were chosen to be with this little amazing boy. God had chose you before you were even born.  God knew that he needed you and that you needed him in your lives.. I am so happy that you gave Braxton the best time he has ever had.  Make a wish is willing to do anything for a child to give them a day full of joy. And it sounded like you gave Braxton more than that. Your. Friendship grew from day 1. To everyone, you are just a youtuber. To this little boy, you were his best friend, his hero, his favorite person, besides mom annd dad. And you kept that going even after your Make a wish day was done  you were an angel to this little boy, and now Braxton is your angel to wnatch over you. May Godd bless you and be with you annd his family through this tough time.. I will be praying for all involved.

He was a great comrade, and will be missed.
Absolutely heartbreaking 😢.  The world needs more like you to mentor these precious kids.
"Oh how blessed am I to have someone that makes me hurt this much in their absents." I'm so sorry you had to deal with his loss in such a sad way, but I'm so glad you got to met such a pure, and beautiful soul, and that you gave him such a beautiful memory to give him a brighter light at the end of the tunnel. This experience will make you stronger, and will help you love more, and I hope you stay safe, and strong!!
RIP Braxton❤

R.i.p Braxton😢🧎🏽‍♂️🥹
I was watching durin my lecture and people thought i was crying cuz of the math
Rip
This video is so sad, why I keep coming back is beyond me. Although, Braxton will be remembered forever.
I wouldn't feel sad about his life - of course you should be because he passed, but trust me man, you're a saviour. You made his dreams come true. That's literally the biggest thing you could ever do! So I feel like we should rather be celebrating because you made a kid happier than ever, and you should not feel sad for that.
Braxton was a sigma 🔥🔥💪🏼💪🏼
R.I.P braxton
RIP Braxton your so strong
Just joining this for the great video. You did a great job. Mad respect for someone to a make a wish. You will always be his hero. No matter what

This video made me cry. The part where he says he wants to go scuba diving with jake the only thing he wants to do. It shows a lot about the light that you brought to him and his life was so bright.. It’s amazing how children can change the world by how innocent they think and live. I’m so sorry about this I’m still crying.
Dear Braxton, we love you so much I wish you never died I alsomost died until I found you on his channel, WE miss you Braxton buddy
Braxton, RIP little man

you where a true fighter
You are a great person. I can see why that bright little angle wanted to spend time with you.

RIP Braxton.
I think your videos are so genuine and raw and the emotion you and your significant other are willing to share with your viewers is so authentic and real.
Dude, it’s so cool that you were his make a wish. Now Braxton gets to live on forever with your video. His parents get to watch their little boy smile and have fun when they miss him. He’s going on so many treasure hunts and showing off is cool crystal he got from you to everyone in the afterlife. You’re a good guy, and it’s sad that the world lost an amazing kid, but you immortalized him. So keep your head up man.
Rest in Piece Braxton🙏
REST IN PEACE BRAXTON

and to think this happens every day, all the time.
Is god real?
Good work good deed that will forever be remembered stay blessed
He chose you of all people, and you showed up for him
F cancer! Kids shouldn’t have to deal with that stuff. Thanks for being a good guy and giving him a positive experience during a very hard time. Thanks also for not editing out your reaction. Sorrow is real and necessary in these cases. Too much of the world feels like it has become cold and jaded.
So glad he could have this time with you. Sorry for the loss. God bless.
you misspelled biden
*Rest in peace, Braxton.*
im tearing up from this right now RIP Braxton
clout chasers in ohio 😂😂💀💀
If Heaven and Hell exist, where do you think you’d go? You can know today by judging yourself by God’s standards (The Ten Commandments). Ever lied? Ever stolen? If that’s not enough, Jesus said in Matthew 5:22 that if you hate someone (without cause) you are subject to judgment. And James 2:10 says that if you break the law only at one point , you are as guilty as a person who has broken it all.   So be honest with yourself. If God judges you on the day of judgement by the ten commandments, would you be innocent or guilty? Heaven or hell? Well, Revelation 21:8 says that all liars will have their part in the lake of fire.   So how can anyone escape the fires of hell? Well, imagine this: You have a bunch of speeding fines worth 500.000$. You don’t even have a single cent to pay it. Just as you are about to get life in prison without parole, somebody comes in and sells everything he has to pay for your fines so you can go free.  Similarly, you and I have broken God’s moral law, but Jesus(who is God manifested in the flesh) lived a sinless life, took our punishment on the cross, paying for our sins. Then 3 days later he resurrected and defeated death. And what you have to do is simply put your trust in Christ alone, not in your good works to save you (Ephesians 2:8-9)  Afterwards read His Word (The Bible) daily and obey it.  "Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”"- John 8:32  Thank you for reading this. God bless you nigga :)l
Rest in peace, Braxton.
i guess you could say it's  so rad!!!😎
ok, now this is epic
He lost a battle, but not the war.
Resp in peace, you won't be forgotten.
rip lil bro
Rest In Peace Braxton🙏, my condolences to his family, friends, and loved ones. God bless them all ❤
Reast in peace Angel Prince
For everyone saying that this is for clout, please remember that one will often accuse others of doing what oneself does, or accuse another of having the mindset that you yourself have. You're exposing yourselves. Get on with yourselves, you have a life to live, you don't need to insult others even if that's the only thing that makes you happier.
Rest in peace Braxton
Rest in peace...
4:08 weird face

This was such a hard video to watch. He was adorable I believe he made as much of an impact on you. It’s amazing how you made his day. Sending prayers to his family because a broken heart never mends and sending prayers and hugs to you for making his wish come true

You are a hero for doing that for him.
Rest in peace Braxton. So many people around the world adore you!

Having lost a sibling to childhood cancer 30 years ago I can so empathize with what's going on in this video,  Nothing more soul crushing than this.  Brought back some serious memories and tears.  Such a beautiful kid.  So sad.
Rip Braxton! ❤
God bless you ! Braxton was an awesome kid adorable and sweet may god bless him❤🙏🔥💪❤️🕊️
❤
Rest easy, Braxton <3   But, anyone else wondering why this is on our recommended?
bruh all of these make a wish kids die sooner or later 💀💀💀💀 whats the point of being sad
TOP 10 saddest skibidi ohio moments 😭😭😭😭😡😡😡😡💀💀
Kicking Butt With 2 T's-  A lot of kids are learning around that age the difference between "but" and "butt" and I think when Braxton said he was kicking Butt with 2 T's he was saying he was trying to tell you "BUTT" not But.   For an Example.. Im kicking but.. with 2 t's = Im kicking BUTT.   (I think this is what he meant. <3)
Rest in peace Brax. Is this just now getting shown for everyone?
F@cking sucks when kids dont get a chance to grow an live life 😢❤   truly sad.
rip braxton
why are people only starting to comment now?
I'm so sorry for the loss cancer is a 50/50 I hope you get better.
😢❤
Honor
I think the most valuable thing he ever found was you Braxton …..😢
Brother you getting emotional shows how compassionate and caring you are. Braxton affected your life on a deep level! I can only imagine how much you mean to his family for doing what you did for him! ❤️
Prayers for the family 🙏
Bro got me tearin up at work.
the fact that you are feeling emotions means you cared deply for this child. May God be with his family in their time of need and mourning.
We're crying with you buddy!
hey, this made me sad js watching him tear up with the things jake said.
RIP
Much love. Thank you for doing this. It also takes a lot of courage to showing your emotions like that. Thank you for being a good human being.
I’m a former Navy pilot, rescue swimmer / diver…  just know today you’re my hero….  RIP Little Man 😢
What a great kid. My heart goes out to the family. 💙 anyway we can help further after donating just let us know.
Come on guys we can do better than 10k for this little boys death and his family
4:26 While Braxton did die, so did the cancer. Only one of them is in a better place right now and it sure as hell isn't the cancer. Braxton is still a winner in my book. you made his dream come true and made his last days memorable.
you can tell he is broken people would just shake it off, but he is crying it all out, mad respect for helping him it’s heart broken what sickness can do to you 😢 I thank you so much for protecting him 🥺😣😭
Thank you for being real and vulnerable. It shows your kindness, strength and courage.
poor child
RIP Braxton
It's heartbreaking to see ones sick at such a tender age. He's in God's memory and his life is not the end. He's at peace. I truly believe there's more to it.
So sorry

No matter the emotions brought up by looking back on those memories, never stop looking back at them. Those are the memories we need to cherish the most. Don’t be scared to remember the ones you loved, you don’t ever want to forget them. You made a tremendously positive impact on that boys life and that will never be forgotten. I don’t know you, but thank you for your kindness.

Poor kiddo. I work with kids and I can’t imagine this happening to one of my kiddos. Prayers for everyone involved. And Braxton, you fought with bravery and honor. Cancer may have stolen your body, but it didn’t steal your spirit. ❤

nothing hurts more than a young child passing away and not seeing their full potential
My best friend Died in 2nd grade I am now in 9th and I still cry about it sometimes. He had the same cancer he had.
So sorry to hear!! R.I.P ! 😪😪😪
R.I.P
If Braxton was looking for treasure, you should’ve given him a mirror. 🫶
Wow unbelievable I feel bad for the kid he is so young 😭😭😭😭😭😭🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️rip
Humanity's #1 enemy really is Cancer, and incurable diseases like Alzheimer's for instance... At least technology improved a lot in the last generations, but there's still a lot to learn and improve, I'm sure. Regardless... Rest in peace, Braxton.
I wish one day soon there is a cure for all cancers so these children can live their lives and parents do not have to bury their kids. When I meant a cure for cancer that is children's cancer and adult cancer. Cancer is one of the most evil of diseases.
How is there hate comments on this video? That shows how fucked up people are.
Watched it again, Broke down again. Braxton, I bet the most precious thing hes ever found was you. Love you.
Rest in peace, Braxton Weidman, your more of a survivor and fighter than any of us.
May Jeus watch over him in heaven.
❤
Braxton rest in peace
My hearts broken bless his little heart. So sorry guys. Kids sure don’t deserve this. His face with that big smile is how I will always remember Braxton.
❤
the video is the most adorable thing seeing the kids reaction to finding things wish he was still here today RIP love from sweden
we love you braxton you made the world a better place with the time you had
Rip ❤😭🕊️

He touched more people’s lives than he could ever imagine. Even a year later. Still reaching people. Making them smile. Making them cry. Reminding them how lucky we are. He was a precious blessing to this earth. And he lives on.

Rest In Peace❤
Nothing breaks my heart more than hearing about a child losing their life for any reason. I've never seen you or your channel and not even sure why YT recommended it to me as I didn't want to cry today and now my heart really hurts for Braxton and his family and friends.  I'm sure his family really appreciates you for what you were able to do for him and you sincerely seem like an amazing person.
You're a wonderful man for granting him this wish!  God bless you!!!!
God Bless Braxton and his family as well as you for being a great human being!
God Bless!
whats up wuth everyone being here a year after and being so recent
Rest in peace little man. Your in a better place now 🕊️. We love you so much.
So sad, what you did was unbelievable.😢 the angel looking down on you.. 😢
being able to upload the video which got over a million views was VERY important wasn't it ? what kind of things do you do to genuinely help someone ? WITHOUT getting something back for it ?
man....that note got my crying sooooo sorry😥😭😥
Dude, I don't know you. I've never seen you till you popped up in my feed. But if I never learn anything else about you I will always know this... you are  a decent human being with a kind, tender soul. You did well bud. You did him proper and should be proud. May God keep watch over this child and over your heart as well. Keep doing what you do man. You have obviously made a difference and will definitely keep doing so. Thank you Pure Heart
why is everyone here now? what is up with recommendations? also RIP
RIP glad you got to live your best life!
What an amazing gift you gave to him!!!
#braxton will be missed
im not sure why we are all getting recommended this, but rip Braxton he will be missed.

Rest in peace Braxton :(
RIP
Im here ya bra and im sure he is happy up there and living his best life and im sure he is happy now that he is in youtube now (RIP)Rest In Peace Braxton
RIP #Braxton  😇😇😭❤❤
Life is absolutely gutting sometimes. There's nothing more soul crushing than watching little kids go through and eventually succumb to health issues. Really makes a person contemplate what life is really about and puts squarely into perspective how unfair it all is sometimes. Feel fortunate you were able to make such a huge positive impact on that little dude who didn't deserve what happened to him.
You are what every person in this world should strive to be.  Thank you for making his last days great for him.
Just remember is that he would have really enjoyed his day, as a treasure hunter/ You Tuber. Given him many happy memories of his day and for the rest of his short life.
that sux bro I'm crying for you RIP Braxton ❤❤
RIP❤
what the heck are up with these comments, some of y'all are messed up. Fly high, king.
i just saw this video not seeing other videos. RIP to Braxton, just know hes at peace. I would never imagine the feeling of being the one wish someone has. Goes to show the innocence and what you do with your videos. Take care.
Rip braxton Rip a legend
🫡

When he started crying I literally started crying 1:44
hi
Rest in peace Braxton
You did it right brother.  Everything you could do was done.  Memories made, for both.  As a dad, that has and will always be my only fear.  Having to go on for your other children and not being able to stop the pain.  Rest in peace Braxton.  And God Bless his parents in this awful time.
Rip Little one :(
Your heart is so special that's why that kid chose you....  God bless you bro 🙏❤️ and to the families of that kid.
I can’t even finish the video bc of how sad this is Rip Braxton ❤
damn man. thats a tough story about a tough kid. you made the last few years of that kid the best he probably ever had, your kindness warms the part of my heart frozen by todays society ❤️! peace be to you
sorry for your loss
F**k Cancer
RIP
😭
<3
Love sending...
❤
You have done God's work and I'm proud to leave a comment here in memory of this child. He is with the Lord in Heaven with the other Angels and Saints. Lord above, grant everyone left in the wake of sorrow, the strength to carry on in his memory. Give them the knowledge that this child is with you now and knows nothing but happiness and love. You are the light in the dark for all of your children on earth and giver of peace as your son Jesus was offered up on the cross so that we may be accepted into heaven. Amen
This made me cry 😢💔
Rest in Peace little man, my heart is broken for the loss your family and this man is feeling !
Rest In Peace little guy
RIP I hate cancer
It's okay buddy ❤he's In a better place with God, with Christ. Rip little buddy. Rip Braxton❤
Appreciate your raw honesty. Life is precious, you are honoring his by remembering him well.
Go scuba Jake
Rest in peace 😢😢😢😢❤🙏🙏🙏
This video reminds me of when I was little and lost my friend to cancer.I didn't really get the chance to see her as she always lived far away.
Crazy that you’re the 1% of a well known influencer who will have the courage to come on here and show emotion about a child whose one wish was to meet someone like you. There’s celebrities who probably do it once, and forget the day even happened.
❤
Rest in piece Braxton may God bless your sweet young soul, Amen🙏😣💔
Fly high buddy, may god be by your side to guide you through the gates of heaven🥺🕊 Will never be forgotten! sending love & condolences to the Weidman family🙏 Stay strong!!!
❤❤❤❤❤
rip man
Thank you for making him happy even if it was only a few minutes, it lasted him his whole life I promise.

This is the hardest thing to deal with, little children are so precious, I'm glad you got to be there for him when he could enjoy it. You made him happy , God bless you.   Make a Wish and St Judes to me, are the best     He made a great choice picking you.  RIP Brandon May God Bless You.

Much love. May you rest in peace strong fighter.
It is okay bro I love you
weve seen DallMyD at his best, now  this worst moment, thank you Jake, it is a sobering video.
This is Heartbreaking but also Inspiring, Sometimes a childs wish seems to simple but you showed up and made it happen for him, Your role in this was way bigger in his heart than you could have ever known, Life is not fair especially when children leave to live in heaven, but hopefully he was sent off fulfilled and happy that he was loved so much and he lived his best life , Thankyou for sharing this ❤🌹You are a kind man
Thanks for giving this kid the time of his life!
This wasnt performed this was real emotion you are the realest hope you are ok rip💔🙏😭🕊️
Rest in peace Braxton you need to take some time of you have already done so much for the community
if theres any youtuber that deserves subs you do great dude man love ya brother
You such a good person!
Rest in peace Braxton I hope you had a good life we all remember you in our souls
Rest in peace Braxton ❤️
R.I.P Braxton
❤️
Hey, if you see this DALLMYD. I hope you're having a good day today.   Unlike @TraditionRoots, who has nothing better to do than hate and make rude remarks about a child passing away. I hope that Braxton has everything well with him in heaven. And I hope that everything's going well for you here.   I had to go through this trauma too, it was painful. But that didn't stop me from making my life the happiest it could. So don't let this be a roadblock and pursue the things in life that you want to achieve. :>       <3
Damn bro... RIP
I’m sore
I love you man 😂❤
Rest in peace. It made me tear up
Rest in peace Braxton 🙏
Rest in peace Braxton love you.😭🥹😭😭😭😭❤💕
Im not crying i just got dirt in my eye😭😭😭😭😭
Always hard to work with after their gone, love him or hate him Jhon Cena talks about how hard it is to get close with the kids and for them to go
rip 🕊️❤️
Okay people have taken this WAY TO FAR!   To the people who are saying "L Bozo and Lmao he died" what is wrong with you. Are you doing this for attention this child has DIED. THIS IS NOT A JOKE PEOPLE! DEATH IS NOT A JOKE AND IT IS NOT RIGHT OR OKAY TO MAKE FUN OF IT AND JOKE ABOUT IT! You people need to grow up and realise internet attention isnt everything. You're telling me you want to be the person that made fun of a dead child. It's not funny to laugh on the dead. You are disgusting people stop doing dumb things for internet attention.
God can you help this man and The kid's Payments Help them to know that you are in their heart. God, it's like me if you want me to feel better. He makes sure he feels better too. In Jesus name we pray, Amen.😢😢
Let's pray
It's okay I lost a person before but I know what it feels like
all the people hating and making fun of this need to grow tf up. yall so disrespectful, its disgusting
All these haters need to get a life
I can't believe I missed this... It's been a Year..   Rest in Peace Braxton.. Rest in Peace little buddy.. I can't believe this happen.
RIP buddy
boo hoo
Rest on Peace...
RIP Braxton... Prayers for him and his family...You did such a great thing for him and was his hero...
rip
I just watched the treasure hunt vid it brings tears to my eyes rip lil guy 😔😔
Rest in Peace :((
Rest in peace 😔😔
What is up with all the toxic ass comments on this video?
Tell me again about the existence of a God, Nobody will ever convince me.
all the incels in the comments talking shit i hope you experience this but 1000× worse.
I know this a painful video for you Jake, but it's beautiful. On a side note there's a YouTube commentor: EDPSSON who is leaving tasteless comments. If you have the time or chance to see this, I urge you to block this user on your channel. Whether a bot or a person; no one should be leaving the comments they are. Take care of yourself friend. <3 This was an amazingly kind gesture.
I wish I would’ve seen this when you first posted this. It’s heartbreaking to see any child suffer. Losing a child is probably every parent’s worst nightmare. Thank you for sharing this with us, Jake.  Everyone should know Braxton and what an amazing kid he was, and his parents, and siblings as well. I’m very sorry for the pain and the loss the Weidman’s, their family, and friends went through. Jake, you’re a really good man and you did a great thing by making his wish come true. I have tremendous respect for you.  Thank you!
Afterward his body was stomped on and chucked in the trash 😹
Smoking that braxton pack 😹✌🏼
Skill issue bozo
Rip
RIP Sweet Angel 😢  You made his life that extra sweet. He did the same for you. Kicking butt with 2 T's references Butt vs. But.
Prayers to all his family and you as well
Rest in peace from 2023
This man fought through his tears and gave every detail to the end, no cuts, no edits. Mad respect for him and regards for the young soul.
I am so sorry dude.  You're a freaking solid guy! you got a grown man crying at work!!!  Thanks for making a difference.
Rest In Peace Braxton 🕊 fly high.
buried with the crystal. i love that.
Afterward his body was stomped on and chucked in the trash 😹
Braxton took the L
Hey man I want you to know that the fact you did that for him is very special. I have a brain tumor as well and seeing you lift someone up in this position is amazing
he is in a better place now bro where no one can hurt him he is watching over you too Rest in peace to the little dude
Skill issue bozo
rest in paradise Braxton 🥺💔 you made him happy in his final days and that’s all that matters, he got to do what he wanted to do and that’s go treasure hunting with his favorite creator on YT, love ya Dallas big love from MT 🫶🏼✨🤎
R.I.P Braxton, I may not have known you personally, but I know you didn't deserve this.
Everybody comes and goes and you gotta remember them sometimes and I get it that it’s hard on people On people because sometimes in life you have the hard things and sometimes in life you have the easiest things so keep him in your heart rest in peace Braxton❤
What!!!!!
he definitly touched your heart and I am positive thats what he wanted most -he will always be a special part of you on all your journeys- but I feel most of all he wants you to carry on with happiness and smiles, you were given a special moment with him so that part of him can live insideof  you....
rip😔
I've always enjoyed your videos, so this one popped up and I watched it. This showed how genuine you are and shows that you have a big heart.  I have big respect for you.   RIP Braxton
Rest in Peace Braxton even after 1 year we still miss you. "Kicking butt with 2 Ts"
Rest in peace, Braxton You're family misses you more than you can imagine At least we know you're in a better place now♥
RIP Braxton, brave little warrior, you`re in a better place now mate!
You are awesome! This really hit home.. My son has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and he was granted a shopping trip thru make a wish foundation. He had a blast. We don't know how long he will be here but we are going to enjoy every minute! It's people like you that really help these children! You are an amazing person!
To the creator: I'm sorry I don't know who you are, I don't believe I've seen your channel before, but Youtube recommended me this video and man, I'm glad they did. Such a heartbreaking story with also a great message. You gave that kid the best day ever.  To Braxton: You fought hard, but you're no longer in any pain and I know you're looking down on your family and smiling. What a brave and strong soul. Rest easy young man and keep on hunting that treasure!
The doctor whose main team got a tumor out of my brain.. This doctor.. Always positive.. Every 6 months I have to do a brain scan and he would check the test to see if everything is ok and I could see how with every year he looked more and more depressed, broken and exhausted still trying to be 100% positive.. No amount of money is enough for someone to go trough this kind of stuff every single day..
youre awsome my dude. you did something amazing. and i hope you see the impact you make on pepoles.
Rip Braxton 😢 this choked me up so badly
I stumble upon video's like these a lot, and it just reminds me how big and wide YouTube is. The internet can be a cruel place sometimes, but it's nice to see a wholesome community. Rest in Peace Braxton, the legendary treasure hunter.

i compatibly broke down when i saw that text
this is probably one of the hardest things anyone has to go through, the parents, his friends, the organization, you, and while I am seeing this a year later I hope youre alright and may Braxton rest in peace
you did all you could man, you let that kid live his dream. he will be forever grateful for that opportunity you were able to give him. you're a great man for that man.
You can tell on the look on braxton's face that he was happy even in his last moments thanks to you, you are a wonderfull person and you helped him in fighting his battle. Such an innocent child was taken from our lives, but he will live on in our hearts. Let's just live life like Braxton wanted us to, "Kicking Butt With Two T's". Rest in peace little fella, you deserve it.
God receive him heaven
Absolutely devastating for anyone who has to experience a loss of someone close to them. Rest In Peace Braxton.
You’re a good man
Rest in peace Braxton. I bet you made a lot of people around you happy and loved, despite being cut way too short in our world. My heart goes out to the family and friends of Braxton ❤
im so sorry for your loss i started feeling emotional and im actually very sorry for your loss and we hope hes looking from hevan down to earth smiling with joy that he got to meet you
I've have been watching you for years and this is the saddest video so far
🥺
This is one of the hardest things to watch 😰💔
Hey man, I think you should talk to someone if you aren't already. Very traumatic experience.
it's incredible how easy it is to fool kids....at least in this case,ignorance was bliss , he got what he wanted most, even if faked,he wasn't aware and was thrilled, can anyone really ask for more than to have just one wish granted before death?
Rest easy in paradise little man❤
RIP young ledgend
I know nothing about your channel but brotha you got me in tears
Rest in peace god bless man
R.I.P. Braxton. Fly high, legend.

To the family: the cancer didn’t beat him. It was a draw. That kid's across the rainbow bridge and is having the greatest treasure hunts imaginable. RIP Braxton.

Ima be tottalu honest haven’t watched you in grip but I did when I was younger probably five years ago now and I loved all your videos couldn’t get enough especially you finding guns but seeing this in my feed getting the nostalgia and seeing how you touched all our hearts especially that, that little boy looked  up to you so much and you made of his biggest wishes come true very heartfelt
🙏Have faith my friend, it sucks when someone so young is taken. You made him the happiest kid in the world and he is so lucky to have you there with him doing what you do🙏. Praying for all of us.
🙏💔🙏
Broke me when I saw the message saying he will be buried holding the crystal. Saddest thing is seeing children taken from this world. RIP Braxton
it's so hard to actually believe famous people even have hearts anymore... you may have restored a little hope in my own heart today... thanks for doin this for the young dude. I hope this core memory locks in for all.
Rest in peace little man
RIP Braxton 😢

rip
scammer gets scammed xd
😢
RIP Braxton ❤
Usually I'm suspicious of these videos.   HOWEVER. You are genuine. Your love made me cry, so I can tell it's true.   You are a genuine human with a humongous heart. Kicking but with 2 T's is my new motto.
thank you for sharing this.
hey man, you gave that kid an amazing day. one of the best of his life. hes in a better place now. no more suffering. he is now your guardian angel, watching over you. Rest in Peace Braxton.  Hope youre doing ok man. best wishes to you and for your mental health. its good to let oout your emotions like this. you are a stronger man for being able to.
You are a good man Sir.. Condolences to Braxton's family, what a sweet young man full of goodness.
wiping my tears with you as I watch this video again❤️
enough to make a grown man cry
Your a man with a big hart, we love you and Braxton and his family. Legends never die
He is at a good place now at our holy father. Rest in peace Braxton 🕊🕊🕊
my Aunt died 3 years ago to cancer and some people said she didn't lose her battle but she won it and im sure braxton is no longer in pain and he is in heaven with god.
I don’t even know how many times I watched this now, but jake, you impacted his life so much and it’s sad that this happens to kids as young as him, or anyone to be fair. You did what you could for him, not everyone gets the opportunity to change a kids life like this
Rest easy buddy, you will be missed.
i almost cryed
R.I.P
Did you ACTUALLY put pepper on your fingers to make you cry? :|
rest in peace
rip
Someone I knew passed away a month ago and it hit like a truck. Our entire community was shocked that someone so young was gone so quickly and all I can think about is how he would have really, really liked the candlelight vigil.
R.I.P
RIP
dang
it is only when you stop crying, he can rest in peace
What the shit? How is this showing up in my recommended a year later?
rest in peace
this is so sad :/ rip lil man
RIP
RIP Lil' buddy
No matter how deep I study philosophy, life, why we are here I will never understand why we have been given self ego and awareness just to suffer. The only thing I derive is our ego is the biggest illusion and causation for our experience in which we enjoy and suffer.  The beauty of life isn’t life its the beauty of the existence of everything.   Rest in piece you have returned to the soil of which we all will lay rest.   Whether you believe in god or not is entirely up to your own belief I don’t believe in religion but I do personally believe the idea that all of which that can’t be derived can’t be believed or not believed in. Therefore I will always remain until my death someone who questions our fundamental reality.
Rest In Peace Braxton Weidman
rest in peace
Seeing him break just tears my heart into pieces, this man is THE man, a legend, a Hero with no cape
rest in peace
ù
God I broke but then I broke even harder when I found out he was buried with the crystal you guys found. Unsure why this is getting recommended to everybody now, but god damn that was hard to watch. Every time I see you it’s all smiles, so it was rough to see you like this. I’m so so sorry
R.I.P little man can’t believe it 🙏🏻
this is the pure corner of the internet
RIP Braxton 🪦 We will never forget you
rest in peace
Rest In peace.
Those who are seeing this, the algorithm did it's job to make us know of this. Rest in Peace Braxton 😢
rest in peace angel
Watching innocent children die unjustly is one of the most painful things that can happen. You made bleak days better for that kid, that’s commendable. RIP.
I’m so sorry for your loss.
<3
youre an angel bro <3
You did a great job man
at least the kid died happy 😢
Sending prayers to the Weidman family so sorry for your loss
real.
Thanks for being real
Braxton.
Algorhytm brought me here, watched the whole video and the original vid. Respect for doing this. 08:02 hit me hard, heartfelt
This is something special you'll remember your whole life. It's a happy memory this boy gave you before he passed and you helped him. You helped him smile and have the time of his life in his final days. ♥ Thank you.
R.i.P little buddy
So sorry to hear that!🧡❤❤
I am so sorry for your loss, you had the honor of meeting Braxton, even if for a short while, i can see how he impacted your life. Thak you for sharing your story with us.
this one hurts
He was a good person, man.
Cancer really is scary. It strikes and there is no stopping. I knew my friends uncle, we used to go on vacations with him and my friend of course. He was a really nice guy who didn't deserve any of that. He died 1 may this year and it really hit me. This shit sucks
You are a kind man. We are all waiting until the next time death arises.  Strange but true. My father passed at 52. I’m gonna be 50 on the 4th. So it’s on my mind.  Life is SO short. Sorry to hear about Braxton’s passing. I’m sending lot’s positive energy your way.
This is heart braking. I wish you and his family the best. I know this was a year ago but I hope that all proceeds go to the family. May I also say some people need to chill people saying stuff like he's acting and he's doing this and that. He's not you can tell he's not acting so just take it down a notch. I'm gonna go chop some onions now. R.I.P Braxton.
I learned a lot about chopping onions in this video. And dust. And allergies.
1:10 The worst acting in human history.
Never take your sadness as a weakness.   It just means you have a huge heart and you care immensely about Braxton.  We honestly need more people like you and Braxton in this world.
I’m so sorry for your loss
Heartbreaking
I see no cape, but you are undoubtably a hero. Chin up brother, you did gods work
</3
Im SO SORRY JAKE! That little boy was such an AMAZING little boy and Im si happy you got to spend time witb him buddy! At least you know you put a smile on that little boys face in the couple days he got to spend with you¡! Think about how happy you made him Jake
❣He will always be in our hearts 🫀
You are an AMAZING human being bro for what you did for little Braxton! ❤ Such a sad story bro!
You did Braxton proud, he wanted to spend the day with you and he did what he wanted to do. It is so sad to here that Braxton is no longer here. Braxton was here for a short time but made more of an impact in his life than most of us do in our life times. Proud of Braxton, his family, and you for being so strong for him. As you quoted Braxton saying "he kicked butt with two T's).
L ratio should have won the gulag
sorry for your loss that must be hard what you went through
RIP Braxton. We will beat cancer in  your name and others who lost their battles. Rest in Power.
He’s a great kid. I’m so sorry for your loss
Dud I know I'm posting this message a year and whatever later, I just watched this video after watching the video with little Braxton and while watching this video of you explaining everything, made me CRY MORE than you bro :( so frigging SAD MAN!!!!! ❤ My heart goes out to you and his family bro:( words can't even begin to explain how SAD THIS STORY IS MAN!!!!!

Hey man cancer can have a big F,U my grandmom passed away from cancer back in 2012 it destroyed my family i attempted suicide a couple times but i knew that was not the answer  i loved her with all my heart and i know that you loved that little boy he was a awesome kid you gave him what he wanted most to be just like you think of it this was he's no longer suffering he's not in pain  and he will always be with you and his family you can't see him but he can see you.

Tears don't show weakness. Tears demonstrate the empathy we are all made for, and the truth that you have the strength to grab it tight and hold on.  In memory of my own boy, father of my granddaughter, Liam. 3/14/1999-9/2/2022. Give Braxton a hug for me, ok?
its like he changed your life more than you thought and also you impacted his in the same way
It always happens to the really nice people rest in peace
I will make an effort to watch all of your content. Thank you for being a real human being. You clearly have a good soul.  God Bless.  RIP little Angel!

So much love and support to you bro
worked with Make-A-Wish in Wyoming who were helping a kid named Oughen whose wish was to be a Youtuber Gamer. He rang the cancer bell (meaning he went into remission) and we were so happy for him! Unfortunately, Oughen's outcome is rare and I really loved Braxton's video with you.
rest in peace braxton🙏🏼

comments: IT'S GOD'S FAULT!!!!!!!!!111!
Children are so pure and innocent, this shouldn't have ro happen. I completely lost it when the message said that Braxton will be buried with your crystal. Such a honor. Rest In Peace Braxton 🙏😥
You truly are good guy.The fact you made that boys dream come true will not go unnoticed. Life is not about achievements, it's about what you do and you did something so precious.

<3
Nothing bad should ever happen to a child.
@Dallmyd,  I'd like for you to know and understand, in your own heart, Braxton is still there, with you and his family everyday and you, made alot of that possible by simply, being who you are and doing what you did and still will do regardless.   The bravery, and courage, he showed you, is his legacy. He's still with you and always will be. He never left you.  Sure his physical presence isn't here, but that indomitable spirit of his, transferred itself to you.   All that time and he chose you, to show him what fun is.   He chose you, and he made that impression on you to continue to carry on.   I was an RN on a pediatric oncology unit for a while and those little souls are braver than any adult I've ever met in any active feild of combat.  They have a great handle on it while the parents, are the ones who usually are beyond mere stress.    You sir, with that huge huge heart of yours that stretches from horizon to horizon made all of this possible.   YOU made this possible and for that, we owe you a debt of grattitde we'll never, ever be paid back.   "These things we do so others may live"   You did that, and a million other little things that all added to his entire time.   Remain focused. Eyes straight ahead.  Keep your heart open, and your vision pure.  From Washington State.  Semper Deinceps
Every lesson people have learned from him and everyone he touched with his bravery in such a horrible situation lets him live on through those people. He made you learn something you might not know anything about and I'd argue he's made you and others better, more caring people. Just living life to the fullest and helping others is a great way to honor Braxton.
You did good by him ❤ God bless you 😢 may there be more people like you ❤ an inspiration
rest in peace braxton
You did good man.
Bless you for the gift of friendship you gave to Braxton ❤😢
You DID GOOD
You did GOOD
You did good man. You did really good. I feel your heart.
Ya did good, mate!
😢
Rest in peace little bro🕊️
R.I.P Braxton
Rest in Peace Braxton
Rest in Peace, died too young 😭😭
Bless you, your family, and most importantly Braxton.  We don't chose who comes in our lives, we are only blessed to encounter them.
This ones to you Braxton thoughts and all to the family too, wishes all the way from Scotland. RIP...
Rip son of god
I want to believe this is proof that god needs little angels👍🏻
RIP little buddy
And people talk about god what god
Such a sad video. The kid didn't show at all he was sick. Just wondering though, what had covid to do with not being able to post the video. I didn't quite get that part
It must have been amazing to be with him that day, he's an angel now living in peace and happiness.
Rip fighter
rip big guy.
Happy I got this recommended, Ty Jake and RIP Braxton ❤
RIP BRAXTON
Just a kid that all he wanted to do is find some treasure.......
Rest in peace little guy. So sorry for the family. I cannot imagine how heart wrenching this must feel.
Thank you for the impact you had on this child's life, RIP Braxton. <3
Awe bless. Sending love to his family and to you. Thank you for doing that with him.❤
God bless you and Braxton's family.
😢😢
Try not to cry challenge impossible 😢
i can relate because my little brother died of cancer a few days ago R.I.P braxton
1 year buddy I we will still miss you
😢
yk i hate to say this but youre crying over a kid that you knew was going to die thats what the make a wish foundation is based upon giving kids their final thing to do before they pass on
1 year later and we still miss you buddy RIP Little guy we love you
Feel for your homie. Braxton was a warrior. RIP
R.I.P Lil man
Rest in peace hero. ❤
You made a huge impact in his life 😢
Rest peacefully little man💛🙏🏽
R.I.P Braxton,  I'm so happy you got your wish, and your day was amazing.  Such a special little man
Now here I am at work crying. This video is very touching and what you were able to do for that little boy is amazing. God Bless!
Your a good dude, sorry for the loss of that young homie!!
I'm not sure why this was suggested to me. I have never heard of you before and treasure hunting is not something I've ever looked up in youtube, But I am glad it found me. You are a hell of a man. Good on you for making that child's life by doing everything you could to make his fantasy come true. But I think Braxton choosing you shows what an impact you and other youtubers have on people's lives. Not saying you didn't realize that or anything, but I do know a lot of youtubers who make content geared towards younger humans don't realize that. Just like a hollywood celebrity or sports hero, youtubers are this generation's superstars so make sure you always keep that in mind.
R.I.P
Proof there is no god. All these comments saying "Jesus took him to save him from evil or god bless you" etc is so stupid...How about donate instead of talking about your absent god that allows children to suffer cancer before they even had a chance to live life. There is no god and its so very sad that this young man knew nothing but pain and suffering. Ill be damned if i see people use a childs death to praise their fictional character. Keep praying people cause that seems to do so much for the innocent.
God took him away to be with Jesus and his dead relatives forevermore 💓  God takes away young people to save them from more evil & suffering
Why is his camera shaking when he mentions how he loved spending time with him and just hanging with him?
You are a great person and braxton was a true fighter, sadly not all battles can be won, but he lived fighting strong.   In many, many years you both will meet again, laugh and have fun. He is waiting for you up there and im sure he is looking over you now from above❤
Braxton makes you value every day you have. Live like there is no tomorrow. No regrets.
♥♥♥
I feel for you brother. I am glad that you got to give Braxton a great experience. You're a good man. Stay strong.
Hi Jake, I am so happy that you were able to bring so much happiness to Braxton and his family. I am also moved by your reaction to the loss of your young friend. I am a retired pediatric nurse and I worked with very fragile kids. The beauty of these kids is that they just want to be kids. To be able to live and play. I have learned so many lessons from my work. You a good man Jake! Ray Moderski
Rest In Peace Braxton. We'll miss you buddy! 😭❤
R.I.P Braxton rest easy little man. 🕊🕊
R.I.P braxton, you fought well young warrior and all we can do now is wish you safe travels in your future to become the most legendary treasure hunter ever to have lived❤‍🩹

we need more youtubers like you caring about ur followers, braxton was so happy to be around you, you gave braxton love and for that we all thank you and love you for everything you do. keep making content. I always look forward to your videos. rest in peace braxton
🙏 Rest in peace little buddy. The best ones seem to go too early! Sad!!!!!
Rest well, Braxton. Rest well, Mom. Maureen.
😢
This guy got me crying like it was my own son.  I always try to bring perspective to my children's lives when talking to them in the hopes that they appreciate things like a good home and something as basic as their health.  The biggest injustice of our existence is the suffering and death of children.  There is nothing worse.
Death is misunderstood anyways, If we were more in tune with nature cancer would not be a thing.. Thank society for him being gone, Cause none of this is natural that we're living. We will miss the pain when we leave, Death is an open door, The afterlife is the before, Nothing is lost, Cause we were never really here, Earth is a school for souls, We are not the body or mind and all our source lifeforce is identical, Everyone is staring in the same mirror, With the same promise of death to prepare for.
God bless you all suffering this loss. What a brilliant soul Braxton is. May his memory always be a blessing! Rest in joy, Braxton ❤️🙏🕊
Brother, there is a special place in heaven for you. God Bless
dan

hey, this is the first time I have seen any of your vidoes ,this vid really touched me, you made a kid have an amazing last year and an really cool life.  You are an amazing person, god bless you ❤️
rip little bro
I just watched this video, dont ever think you didnt make a difference, you made the difference in a childs life before he left this world ,you are the person that made him happy and thats what counts ,i wish things like this didnt happen to children it kills me inside im sure you feel the same ,you did something not only to make him happy but you make a difference in this world ,im sorry for the lose of this child but he took happiness to heaven and you made that happen ,stay safe and god bless you
he in a better place now
r.i.p. Braxton, you gave him special memories.
YouTube really just decided to make me cry today huh? Rip to young Brax!
You have such a good heart. The time you spent with him was probably the most important event in his final short life. You will carry him with you as he carries you with him into the next life. We are all here for a purpose and part of yours was bringing that sweet child a glimmer of joy when he needed it most. Bless you and keep kicking butt...yeah...with 2 "t's".
😢😢😢😢😢
What an incredible thing you did for him! You should be so proud that you were chosen to make his dream come true! Well done Man...I can see how hard it is but what you've done is amazing.
We love him and try to not show your motion rest in peace
I’m crying with you.  No child should ever suffer or die from anything but they should all live a full life and be all they desire to be.   Braxton was certainly a strong little warrior.  My heart breaks for you as well as his sweet parents, siblings, family and friends.  They lost one amazing little boy.  He’s now living with Jesus, no more pain and suffering.  He’s free at last from the awful cancer.❤
😢Rest In Peace Braxton
🖤
rest in piece lil bro
I’m so sorry. 😭
Rooooolllllll Tiiiiidddddeee Braxton!!! ❤🐘🏈 Alabama behind you !! 🥹 ❤
Braxton is and was stronger than i'll ever be. I hope there is a heaven where you can be at peace for eternity. I dont know this channel, i dont know this kid. Your life was cut short too quickly.
Rest in peace braxton
Rest in peace, Braxton.

Rest in piece little buddy. Such a great, happy kid. Cancer is so sad and cruel
Rest in peace Braxton ❤🙏

I cant really donate, but i will just say  Braxton did not deserve all this that happened to him. but he definitely deserved every single thing you did for him. it may not seem like much, but for him it was probably just. the best
Jake, on behalf of all your viewers, thank you for making that kids life so much better and to his family we love you and he will be missed by alot of people.

Rest in peace braxton
RIP 🕊🙏
Om Shanti little brother 🙏🏻🌞❤️🕉️
your impact was big on him man. you made the little guy's day so much better by being there for him and words can't express how tough it was to hold the emotions back just to be happy so he can be happy. you both are warriors him and you together are like dynamite, the fuel to each other's hearts and holding to that. and he is there my friend, and he still is, just keep your head up for him so he can always see the emotions he feels coming from you just keep finding a reason to keep going just like how he kept going to see you. we all love you little guy it was too soon but at least you used your last moments with your loved ones and the guys you looked up too. rest in piece baxton gone but never forgotten <3
Fly high little fellow ❤
we love you braxton, we love you jake. rip.
Rip ❤❤ braxen
man your a great guy  I hope braxton is in a better place now
your a good guy
Godspeed, little man. Godspeed.
Rip Braxton he’s in a great place right now🥺 he loves u and he’s looking down to keep u safe and he’s family safe too I just Know he loves u all!!❤️
Your a good man.
Haven't seen it in the comments yet, so I thought I'd comment it. If you don't already see a therapist or a counselor, or just someone who is trained to talk about trauma then you should. This encounter seems like it has affected you a lot, and that is completely okay and so is crying, but seeing someone who can help you process this even more helps a lot. Hope you find peace man.
This is absolutely heartbreaking Jake. The vulnerability you showed and the emotion is what makes us love and support you man. You're a genuine good hearted amazing person. I hope now you can think about the times with Braxton and his family and be happy about the wonderful days you gave him. I can't imagine the hurt though. God Bless brother. <3
It's a tough thing to happen. But we all have to understand this is the part of life. But his was taken too soon. Rest in peace Braxton, we'll miss you.    Screw cancer... I'd sacrifice myself just to find a cure.
Damn bro... this is the part of the job nobody ever talks about
Its human to cry Jake when my mom passed  back in 2000 she was suffering with MS and they found out the cause of her death was Congestive Heart Failure. I was happy yet I was sad my mom died in her sleep. I feel yah brother.
Rest in peace Braxtonno may you find all the treasures up in heaven
You did something amazing for that young boy, so you'll always have that knowledge at least! You gave his life a special memory that I'm sure his family is more than grateful for!   It's so sad when a young child is taken away, he seemed like he was such a sweet kid. But thank you for making him happy!   RIP Braxton 💙
Incredible, I have been going through treatment at a children's hospital even though I'm 22. My main oncologist says that it is the most amazing yet the worst job she has ever had. I have seen kids alone for days to weeks in those hospital rooms, and this is the type of thing that keeps them going. Thank you so much for sharing this story.  You have done something amazing.
You’re a great guy, man. There’s a reason his one wish in the world to be with you. Rest In Peace Braxton.
Rest in peace Braxton <3
Shit is just unfair man, poor kid :(

RIP.
Braxton was the strongest fighter I've ever seen and he did not stop until cancer had taken over. Really frick cancer. Rest in peace Braxton...
Awww. Man I am so sorry
Why is everyone only seeing this video now (including me)
Just because his body gave up, doesn't mean he ever did. Rest in peace Braxton you'll be missed by so many.
Hang in there.  My.   Buddy
I don't know you, I don't know Braxton, and never heard about his battle before.  But these tears know his pain. They know your pain, and the families pain. They know him. I may not, but my tears sure do.
i just won my first warzone game
Children should NOT be dying of cancer. What kind of world are we allowing that children experience such a fate? Time for a change.
R.I.P G
I think he impacted you more than you ever thought. You made an equal impact on his life, I'm sure. Rip Braxton 😢
❤🙏
You did everything you could to make him happy at least for a day, a moment, a second and you earn that, you make it happens... I wish Braxton rest in peace and he probably somewhere watching you too because he loves you, much love from Brazil.
May you dance in the fields of elysium young warrior.
I'm so sorry to hear...😢 Rest in peace Braxton! ❤ Life is really unfair sometimes...
Fly high Braxton. To the family, we are deeply saddened but we will always be welcome to supporting you all. We loved watching Braxton spend a day with Jake. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. Love, The Flip Tech crew and family. ❤

The problem with the make a wish. My son was granted a wish. The trouble is the reason for the wish. RIP little Dude, The only wish I had was for my son to reach adulthood. I am sure that was your parent's wish as well. Sadly, your wish was granted, we, as parents were not so lucky. Just know not one day, heck one minute goes by they are thinking & missing you.  One day these wishes of children won't be needed because the wishes & prayers Of past & future parents came true, and all the killers of dreams are no more. No more Cancer, No more DMD, and no more children passing before their time. peace
Rest in Peace Braxton
My friend and uncle just died from cancer and my stepmum has stage 3. It’s hard as hell and breaks you to watch people suffer knowing you can’t help them and take all the pain away. This young boy is now pain free even though it’s excruciatingly painful for everyone who knew him he is now in a better place. Rest easy little man ❤
I hope Braxton is now having a peacefull life in haven and rest in piece braxton .
he's your guardian angel now man. i'm sure he looks forward to all the future treasure hunts you two will have.
ive got no words. Rest in peace lil fella<3
❤ 🙏

Thanks for sharing this story about your experience with Braxton. It is always hard trying to understand why things happen but we must move on. He must be happy now with all of the magically beautiful gems he is collecting in heaven. I pray and hope that his caring family is doing well with guidance from above.

You’re a super strong dude. So many men would definitely not film themselves crying the way you are. It’s all good man. I’m so pleased you let your emotions go. That’s the best way to heal. Sending you so many hugs. 💞💞💞💞
You did so much. He could have wanted to go with anyone else but he chose you. And you made it the best.❤
Everyone is a child in the inside we are all a child sometimes tbh and it's ay okay to sob buddy I sob sometimes too

Long live Braxton forever in our hearts 😣😥

And it’s okay to cry man  we all loved that kid  he was a special little kid  we miss u buddy
R.I.p Braxie
I'm so sorry for your loss. Braxton was a very special little boy and I'm sure he is busy playing with the angels ❤💔🫂🙏🙏🙏
I know how hard this is . Thank you for giving him joy and happiness. Crying is how we show love and compassion and he's definitely worth every tear! Prayers for his family.
im glad that youre the type of person to know how special that wish just was... he chose to come hang out with a good person and have some fun!!!! way to go!! his energy is still around!
🙏🏻Eternal rest grant unto Braxton O Lord and let the perpetual light shine upon him. May he Rest in Peace. Amen. 🙏🏻
The fact that this kid could have done anything but chose to hang out with Jake, that shit broke my heart into a trillion pieces. Rest in peace Braxton, Hope you had a good life ❤ 😇.
You are a hero. I am sending big hugs. You both helped each other. May the memories help ease the pain of loss.
Awe… this is so amazing… for Braxton and you ❤❤❤ a life changing adventure for both of you.  Real men do cry ❤❤
Half the video is you crying, we get it
This is heartbreaking. You came up on my feed, I’m afraid I’ve never heard of you before. However, the sheer fact that you will sit in front of the camera and lay your emotions bare is some powerful stuff. Sadness and grief is a human right of passage, and it is something that we all experience but for those who feel like they can’t show it I have to hide it, your video will have more impact the new new. You’re not just celebrating the life of a wonderful little boy here, but you’re showing other dudes that this is normal and crying is normal and being heartbroken is normal and that’s probably one of the most prominent societal problems lately.  Braxton was right. You’re a total hero and a legend.  ❤  New follower interested to see what you get up to.
God bless you.
Praying for his family.
he is treasure hunting with wild, healthy, limitless abandon right now and super smiling upon the grace you showed him.. its all love… we all be kickin’ butt (with 2 t’s) in honor of Braxton, Make-a-Wish and all the children navigating scary illnesses…
You show so much passion in every one of your videos. You gave Braxton one of the best experiences he could have ever wanted but meeting him is the greatest treasure you’ve ever found. I’m glad you both had each other and that his family will always have you and your support as well. He will always be with you Jake, on all of your adventures. Rest in peace Braxton, you are gone way too soon
Rest in peace Braxton
So sorry you had to go through this rip
I’m so sorry so heart breaking for you..but he is in heaven with Jesus and he is happy not in pain..we are in the end of days get tight with Jesus you will see him again really soon.
I am so sorry for your loss praying for all
I’m not crying, you’re crying!!!😢😢😢😢😢
❤
Braxton is your shining crystal in the night sky!! God Bless You All♥️🇺🇸🙏🏻♥️
I am so very sorry❤ I wish that cancer did not exist!!!  My condolences 🙏🙏🫂
Braxton is with God, now.  Braxton is healthy and happy in Heaven.  Please remember this.  Braxton would not have it any other way.  One day, those who love Braxton will see this beautiful child again.  God will make that promise come true.  May Our Beautiful and Loving God, give peace and comfort to all those who knew and loved Braxton. 🙏 🤗 😢 🌈
I’m seeing this a year later, but I just want to tell you how proud I am of you. A group of people gave my grandson his wish 11 years ago to go to the ocean. It takes a village and Carter loved it! Thank you again for your servant spirit. And God bless you!
I don’t understand why innocent kids get horrible sick and pass.
You are a beautiful soul. I am grateful he chose you💕❤️ RIP Braxton
❤ Thank you for your generous heart ❤
Condolences to Braxton's family and friends. I'm grateful for the opportunity to see this video, so thank you
Precious Braxton - fly high with the angels as you are. RIP. You will be misses.  No more suffering.
For Braxton  Fly, fly little wing Fly beyond imagining The softest cloud, the whitest dove Upon the wind of Heaven's love Past the planets and the stars Leave this lonely world of ours Escape the sorrow and the pain And fly again Fly, fly precious one Your endless journey has begun Take your gentle happiness Far too beautiful for this Cross over to the other shore There is peace forevermore But hold this memory bittersweet Until we meet Fly, fly, do not fear Don't waste a breath, don't shed a tear Your heart is pure, your soul is free Be on your way, don't wait for me Above the universe, you'll climb On beyond the hands of time The moon will rise, the sun will set But I won't forget Fly, fly, little wing Fly where only angels sing Fly away, the time is right Go now, find the light
You will be rewarded for the kind thing you did for  that sweet little boy You made him so happy 😊 He's in Heaven now  no more pain n suffering Prayers  for family

#fuckcancer
#FUCKCANCER. i lost one of my closest friends from Leukemia, we were playing PS3 one night, the next morning she never woke up.
Thank you for your compassion and kindness and making a difference when this beautiful child needed it the most. You and Braxton were obviously forever changed in the best way possible and thankfully he lives on in the hearts of those who truly loved him. As Braxton Rests In Heavenly Peace, I lift up his family and friends and pray they find comfort in God’s word and His promises and know that they will see him again one day. Till then, they have the most beautiful beloved guardian angel watching over them until they meet him again someday, in Paradise.❤️‍🩹🙏😇🕊️
Thank you for not editing out your emotions and tears.  What an impact, and he has obviously changed your life.  He will live on through you now, along with his family and friends.
That is incredibly sad news that I am sorry to hear. The fact that his one wish was to met and hang out with you and the fact that you were able to fulfill that for him I'm sure it meant everything for him.
Wondering where is god in such a moments. When we expirance so much pain under an All-Powerful "Love"... :(
RIP little man 💗

I am so sorry for your loss and the pain you are in but you have to remember that YOU made this special little boy happy.  Now Braxton is watching out for you from heaven.
Rest in peace, sweet Braxton…..it is just not fair for children to die….ever.
Jake, you are a truly good, caring, humble and compassionate man! If only the US (and the world) shared your genuine empathy  - we would all be in a much better place today! Please stop making cry, too!  Rest in Peace, dear Braxton - you were a truly inspirational young person!

You can make a day each year dedicated to him. The Braxton Day Treasure Hunt. It will always be a special day to you, his family, friends, etc. Go for it!
Much love to you for being there for Braxton.
RIP sweetheart. I bet you’ve been finding lots of treasure with the help of the Angels.
You have a heart ❤️ of gold  .... 5hank you so much for the love you gave him .... love from Canada
You're an amazing human being ❤ may Braxton rest in peace
Wow!  Braxton’s loss is incredibly palpable in this video. I shed tears watching this!  What an honor indeed to have had him in your life.  It is obvious that everyone who knew him will be forever changed, and know how to count our blessings. He is now in my heart too❣️. Sweet sweet blessings and peace to Braxton’s family and friends.
I wish i would have seen this way before now. I'm truly sorry for your loss.
Man this video broke my heart. I understand. I lost my cousin when he was 11 to Cystic Fibrosis. Losing a child is very hard. This is a very hard cruel life. I can't express how hard losing a child you love is. Especially when its family.
Jake I don't know you, at all! I got here from a Cave Diver video? IDK how that even happened? But I just fell in love with your heart!!! God Bless Him, and God Bless YOU! I've done my best to help! I lost my only daughter and my brother that was my best friend in Aprils....Rest In Peace Braxton
Rest In Peace sweet boy🙏🦋🌈
You made  his wish come true, thank you
Jesus Loves Us very Much . We will all be together in Heaven. You must Behave love one another and relish the Journey. Rest is Peace Braxton see you up there . 💪🏽✝️💪🏽🙏📿✝️✝️✝️❤
My mom was a Pediatric Oncology RN for 40 years. I used to volunteer in my youth until someone I got close to suddenly died when I showed up with a gift for him. I lost it and never went back. I laid down in the back of her van and cried the whole way home and asked her, “mom, how do you do it?” Through silent tears she said, “you love your patients truly, but you learn to build a distance. You have to in order to help the thousand others who need you. That’s what they taught me.” However, I know my mom never had that true distance. She would have a drink on her nights off and drown in her silent despair. She called them her “bebeles” and would buy them gifts from her own money and never missed a funeral of one of her bebeles. My mom… oof… my mom is one of the good ones. Cancer is so wrong and unfair on every level.   Unfortunately, my hero mother who saved countless lives of both adults and children is now a brain damaged triplegic due to strokes. They didn’t believe her when she showed up at the hospital telling them (in her heavy accent), “I am having a stroke.” They let her brain die for 2 days until she went into a coma and needed emergency brain surgery. Her disabilities have bankrupted us both and I alone take care of her without an ounce of help. Just like cancer, human error and assumption can be just as deadly.   Life isn’t fair. Most of the time, it really sucks (if I’m honest). But it’s because of beautiful people like this little boy, his family—and a YouTuber along with a community who was willing to grant him and his family some rare joy in this world that makes life bearable. I see a lot of what makes my mom so special in you, sir. Despite all she’s lost, she still smiles her big childlike smile every single day. Nothing can take away her heart of gold. I hope you never lose yours. Cheers.
I’m so sorry for your loss.
Why is everyone getting this vid recommended after a year
❤😢❤😢
Why did it take a year to see this 😭😡 this is what should take priority amongst the millions of videos may you rip Braxton and thank you for making his day better and his life in general 😭
R.I.P. little buddy ❤❤❤
So sad that such a sweet innocent child dies so young. Dear Braxton you kick butt with two TT … see you up in heaven! Yes I’d trade places … what a sweetie! Condolences Braxton’s Family, may God give you peace in your heart!
So sorry about losing your buddy Braxton last year.  This video just popped up in my feed. Braxton sounded like a lovely boy - cancer sucks!  My boy Jason was diagnosed when he was 7 with one of the more treatable forms of childhood cancer, Hodgkins Lymphoma, & went into remission after chemo & radiation treatments and received a grant from Make A Wish to go to Disney World in Florida.........he did not have any siblings to share the trip with so they told him to invite a friend & they covered the additional expense.  It's such a wonderful organization.  The boys had a wonderful & memorable experience.  Five years later the cancer returned with a less favorable prognosis but he pushed through. Children are so resilient in facing these battles but sadly, his immune system was destroyed by the intense treatment and he got an infection that took his life before the last scheduled treatment---he was so very close to remission again.  It's heart-breaking when a child dies, I know.  Yours & Braxton's story is very touching - thank you for sharing it.  He obviously touched your heart strings...I pray that you and his family are doing better.  Sending love & hugs to you, & a special thanks for bringing joy to Braxton & making his wish come true.  I'm going to watch the Make A Wish video now but I wanted to take a moment to leave you a comment on this one.  Take care Jake, Wanda 🤗
What a most beautiful man who really cares with an amazing heart and soul 😅😅😅😅😅
How I’m just seeing this, is beyond me. Thank you for being who you are, Dall, and thank you for stepping out and being their for Braxton. He’ll be there waiting for more adventures, and in the mean time, don’t ever stop kicking butt with two ‘T’s’. 👊🏼🙃🫵🏼
this just came across my feed, never heard of your channel or braxton but this spoke to my heart. so real and heartfelt. god bless you and braxton and his family
❤❤❤
So sad much respect appreciate you bro keep your head up rip braxton
I'll never understand why children die. It's just wrong. We aren't supposed to bury our children.
Stay humble and God bless you and his family
😢I remember his make a wish, how excited he was. Thank you for everything.  I sure do miss seeing Brax.
Im sorry that he got cancer at  that age. If God was real, he would never give a child cancer. May he rest at peace hold your crystal.
You are a wonderful young man. Now you got me crying too, and I never had the pleasure of meeting that little kid! May he rest in peace and may his family and friends rediscover smiling again soonest!
You really cared about him, you loved him. I appreciate that. Thank you for everything you did for him. He’s not my son and I didn’t know him personally, but if his time was being cut short, he deserved every ounce of love in the world.
its okay braxton not hurting he okay he dont have that bad body anymore he just okay he's with god and is happy and not hurting sorry for your loss
Sweet soul...He is running the streets of Gold with a perfect body and unimaginable fun adventures. So glad you got to experience time with Braxton.
I hate that cancer does not discriminate. It's always harder when it's a child.
Breaks my heart man. For you and Braxtons family. Got I cant stop crying.
Fly high little man 😢
💔😢🛐✝️🙏🏻📖💙💙💙💙💙💙 God Bless you Braxton..... you're running, laughing and playing in Heaven now  precious boy....🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️

Rest in Peace Braxton-thank you for caring about that little boy because it made a huge impact in his life!
🙏🙏
Man I cannot imagine as a parent having this happen to one of my young kids. God would really have to hold me up in something like this. I am a mess just thinking about this little boy, and his family. Thank you for doing something for him that really impacted him during the hardest time of his life.

Oh my gosh I have no idea why this video popped into my feed but this is so emotional. You made that kid so happy!!
Thank you for what you did for him! When someone has a talent, they need to share it with others. It really doesn’t cost you that much, if anything, but as a gift it can mean more than we can ever know. Rest in peace Braxton.
He cared about you just as much!
❤Bless him, his family & you.  A forever angel 😇
Prayers to Braxton his family, friends  and you !!  Jake , Just remember just as you were his angel he is yours ! I whole heartedly feel as though God puts people in our paths to lead us and show us the way ! Thanks for being such a good hearted person !  You are making a difference in this world ! Keep up the good work !!
God bless you bro, God will reward you and hold him in His hand now
You are one hell of a fine young man Jake, and I am sure that Brandon will be remembering his wish with you with fondness in his heart.  He did enjoy his day with you.  Sometimes the therapy that we may provide for others turns out to be therapy for us.  And I believe that you received  your share in spades.  That was an awesome thing that you did for Bandon?  That is why you have the fan base that you have.  Jake.  You have a good heart  and you lead with it.  Keep up the good work.  We will have Brandon's  family as well as you and your's in our prayers.  Keep up the good work.
You have a heart of gold❤😢 I've watched  your video where you had a wreath made for the Titanic & threw it overboard ❤ you made that little man's dream come true & for him to be buried with your crystal absolutely blows my mind away, he truly loved you❤😢💔Thank you for helping Braxton❤RIP Braxton ❤💔💔😢
What a special story you have to tell. Just think how happy you made Braxton feel. His family will always remember what you did for him.RIP Braxton.💙
Little man is a true gem 💎 💙🌈
Sweetest ever..so very very precious ❤️ God rest you precious treasure ❤ hunter
Made me bust a couple tears, god bless that kiddo and you
Crying with you❤️ What a wonderful connection you made with him❤️
❤❤❤❤💯
I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW A CHILD GETS CANCER.
Prayers for his family and friends
You made the last few chapter's of Braxton's life an incredible journey and I strongly believe Braxton is still on this journey with you until you meet him in Paradise.
I just found this. You are a Saint my friend. Braxton had his wish come true. How great is that!!! Keep giving your light. The world needs it.
If you've spent any time with a child who has cancer you will soon notice how strong they are. They have a divine peace about them. They are not alone, God takes care of the little ones. Braxton's parents said he never cried. He's in a place so beautiful we can't even imagine. I'm Catholic and I'll light a candle for you Braxton and my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family during this difficult time for them. Rest in peace little man you have found your greatest treasure.  Phil. 4:13
He chose you because your awesome dude, You made his dream come true and for that your a hero, Thank you! Rest easy little buddy

somehow I missed the notification for this video and the original video for this, but I just wanted to say that I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how much Braxton enjoyed his time with you and how much effort you put in to making it the best day ever.. Total respect for that.

This ones for Braxton. RIP little guy.
I.can feel the emotion through the screen! You truly are an amazing person. I love that you dont hold back your emotions. I will definitely keep them in my prayers. I'm watching this a year later but still  pray continuously for them.  ❤❤❤ what a beautiful sweet treasure hunter!!!!
Rest in Peace Braxton. May you enter gods kingdom and search for all the shiniest crystals and little treasures you could imagine. Be at Peace buddy
Rest in peace little buddy.. <3 i know how it feels, i lost my mom to pancreatic cancer on the 21st
God bless you Weidmen family! Praying for Holy Spirit to bring you peace and comfort in this painful time! Sending all our love!
i'm glad that i donated to help Braxton but i am beyond sadden that Braxton is gone................its not fair and not right that a 9 yearold is taken before even getting to enjoy life
Brain cancer is a tough one. My niece died of it. I am so sorry that this little guy had to fight through it. I hope the family knows that there are so many people who are sharing in their grief and loss. Prayers as they deal with this horrible loss. Thank you so much for doing what you did for him. You probably have no idea what it meant for him. God bless you all. There were so many expenses when my niece was going through brain cancer. Gas expenses, hotels, food out, medical expenses, time away from work. Please give anything you can. If the only thing 500 people can give is a dollar. It is still $500!
🙏🙏🙏🙏

Rest in peace little bro you will never be forgotten your legends will life on formefer

Thank you guys, Jake, Make a Wish, and especially the family for letting us be a part of such an amazing moment.

Mi amigo eres muy bendecido por qué Dios te puso a  un angelito en tu camino para que lo conocieras y hicieras de su alegría algo hermoso y que creciera ese amor que solo dios nos comparte y tu fuiste el que hiciste que si vida tuviera sentido apesar de las circunstancias que fueren le distes una alegría que nadie se la podrá quitar y que siempre vivirá en nuestros corazones que dios abrace tu corazón y que ese llanto alivie tu alma te deseo muchas bendiciones y aquí estamos contigo siempre bendiciones
Braxton were so sorry
Rip man at least you made his wish😢
He has left a mark on you and many of us who follow you. He was a unique little warrior. Remember that video from make a wish He was in a relationship with his hero, You. It is the greatest gift he could receive and you let him be with you and your friends. Thank you so much🙏
So sad He lost Hos fight but uou made Him have a special day that uou could see He loveed every minute thanks for sharing a great lost snd lovely boy.
RIP Braxton you were an amazing diver 😢
😭😭😭😭😭😭 god be with you braxton
Braxton, you're my hero, God Bless You! RIP
Rip little buddy
Don’t think for a second he is gone. His body gave out but God doesn’t create life to destroy it. Not only is he alive, but he’s actually having the best time you could ever imagine!  This I promise you. The soul that was Braxton, is now Braxton x 1000. One thing that makes me happy due to pain from loss is to watch near-death videos, and how people who have clinically died report seeing the most beautiful reality, feeling the best theyve ever felt, and they know they are in the pure essence of love. It’s THIS life that hurts. Dont think for a second he is having anything other than an amazing time with God. Believe it. Through and through.
I’m truly sorry for your loss may he rest peacefully in heaven
I going to miss him
Rest in peace I rember watching the video then I saw this and he will be remembered forever even the after life
This little guy and his family will be in my prayers and I pray the best for you  and everyone who was apart of that family and friends. It is also amazing how you did a little thing by giving a crystal to him that you were going to keep, that says a lot about you and who you are. I hope the best for y’all.
Pip ❤Braxton
❤ ur heart!  Inspiration.
I remember this video what u do Jake it's amazing . Up u raised a lot of money for the family and u absolutely made that little boys day. Your amazing Jake.

I’m just soooo sorry 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖
Sorry 😞
rip
Rip Braxton, you are really amazing, you will be missed.
His first anniversary after passing which is feb 1st. On that day no matter what we shall remember him for his funny jokes and humor. I was in his class. In his journal we quoted something which is “even when Times get ruf never have disbelief in your self becose Things will alwas get beter ina way. So never give UP!” - Braxy this is in the same exact spelling. this on a shirt that was green for his favorite color
i am crying he was so kind
Rest in peace Braxton
Jake he’s in a better place now god had to put a end to his suffering
I cried watching this
I hope Braxton has a good life in heaven✝✝
Rest in peace Braxton
Hey bro Braxton is in a better place now he’s not suffering he’s not hurting he’s going to be missed and he got to live out his last few eight a few days or a week or a long for his true last wish to go in treasure hunt in with you and everything and he will always remember you and he will always remember him I know it’s hard seeing someone like that you can’t show no motion and then after that
We all have these mottos for life and something thats been written in the past, now painted on the wall or on a sticker. Throw them all away because Kicking Butt with 2 Ts tops them all
Rest In Peace Braxton
Braxton so many people miss you right now even your family they wish you were there with them and  at the dinner table but  but just know everyone loves you. Feast in peace busy

I am crying watching this this is so sad
Hi
hugs and love jake u have made a big impact on little Braxton life he will forever remember the time he had with you and his family ( rest in peace little one)
Jake, you are an amazing person. You went out of your way to make him as happy as possible. This video made me cry, so I hope you know that you and Braxton's family are not alone. Rest in peace little Braxton. You will be missed. I would have chosen to hang out with you as well, because you are a good person.
Wow, such a moving tribute you have given to Braxton and it explains fully why he wanted to spend his Make A Wish day with you. When I was diagnosed with prostrate cancer, I made up my mind then that I would be victorious over cancer, victorious either in life or in death. Either way I would defeat it and that’s exactly what Braxton has done. He is Victorious.    Thank you sir for sharing your emotions.
R.I.P. Little Fella  Sorry I couldn't donate more than 5 bucks, we are struggling but I wanted to donate at least that and my condolences to the family. Thank you D. for sharing and making your videos.  You mean more to us than just a videos, you take us on journeys and adventures that some or most of us will never be able to do and Braxton was one of the lucky ones you blessed with your time and adventures for him. I'm sure he is smiling down knowing he had the best time with you. You are one amazing young man. God bless Braxton's family.
rest in peace
You have the softest heart. I so glad you got to grant his wish. I can see your heart is broken. Keep up the good work.
RIP Braxton🙏🏼 I'm sorry for your loss
😢😢😢 I watchd that jam sory for your Los 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I'm sorry for your loss but great job keeping it 💯 👌 👍 👏

May you rest in peace The best live Braxton We wish you Good Hope.
💔💔💔
❤💔
God Bless You!
I know it is painful to see innocent children die far before their time. Please try to take comfort in knowing that Braxton is with God in Heaven. Braxton is no longer suffering, rather, he is experiencing the ultimate love, joy, peace and light that we cannot even begin to comprehend.   Jake, all I ask is for you to continue with serving children the best you can and hopefully you will assist with putting a smile on their beautiful faces. If you need to talk, I am a licensed professional Therapist.   May God bless, protect and give you strength always.
seeing Jake cry jus brakes me its so sad to see him cry💔(rest-in-peace)
Braxton sounds awesome
I so sorry bro it’s hard without a friend
1:45 “he could’ve done anything… and his one wish… was to hang out with me… and go find some treasure.” This truly broke me the first time I watched this. R.I.P. Braxton

And now, I'm now I  watch this video of his passing. My thoughts and prayers go out to you and his family. He's a angel flying high in heaven. Thanks for your videos. 💔🙏😭
R.I.P Braxton
Rest in pest
Family Of Hope here on YouTube lost their son Elijah to cancer. While he had tumors in his head and skull, he actually had a form of bone cancer. It’s wild seeing a healthy happy kid go through treatment and get so so so so sick. I don’t think I could survive chemo, I don’t. I don’t know how kids physically do. But with their son, he got better then he got worse. The steroids and the tumors made him appear a lot different and it can be hard to see. Elijah was always so handsome, even in the end, but seeing what that cancer did to his body was devastating. Unfair, and devastating and every single ounce of Elijah was too good for that cancer. Seeing children deteriorate like that is just something…something unnatural. It is natural, it naturally happens unfortunately, and yet..I still can’t say its natural. The craziest thing of all though..is seeing how resilient children are. I mean..my god… they’re resilient as..as anything. It’s wild to watch and reminds me that I need to stop whining about so much h.
I cannot even fathom the honor of having a child chose to meet me for their Make-A-Wish. That’s so special.
Sending prayers to you, Braxton, and Braxton family. Rest in peace Braxton. Even I dont know him I love him with all my heart. Braxton is an angle😇😇😇
my Granma and grandpa died from cancer, so I feel you
Rip Braxton bye bud
We are with y you man
rest in peace little man
You have a big heart ❤. I feel whit you. All love to you. I love your videos ❤
I lost my aunt from cancer she was amazing ever since she died I have been quite. But when I saw Braxton it made not be quite he is so brave. And I know what you and the family are going through. You are so nice Jake to do that for him. R.i.p. Braxston
Rest in peace little man! ❤️
That video made my day and I loved that kid he was so great and bright and amazing. We love you Braxton and you touched all of our hearts❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sinto pela perca do garoto   estou no Brasil  vir o video do caça tesouro onde  foi  muito divertido e  gostei muito  pela felicidade daquele dia que tiveram juntos. Devermos guardar sempre aquele sorriso  do Braxton e orar pela família e amigos  que  Deus venha confortar a todos.
I sorry
Rest in peace little man

I've watched this video about 50 times now just to help the family of this sweet brave young man
Braxton Rest In Peace ❤❤ my heart is broke
for christmas  i want  to see you i love you so much when i see you cry i cry i care about you
This video is sad and makes me cry every time I watch it.. But it also makes me happy to see there are ppl like u in the world that all they want is to make someone happy
Braxton will be ok he his going to be take cared by god he will always be your favorite youtuber
Now I don't usually cry but when I do it's for a good reason, to know that a child who's life was cut short spends some of their last moments with you is crazy, they could almost ANYTHING yet they decide to spend the last moments of their life with you. I wish Braxton was my brother because he just seems like a really nice kid, RIP Braxton.
i swear i almost cried my friend had cancer about 3 years ago but thankfully she survived although the effects of the chemo are damaging her heart and her lungs currently the doctors dont know whats going on but ye
You're a good man. Keep doing what you're doing.
Jake, you nene cease to amaze me! You are so humble.  I cried with you ❤
love you jake

Jack it’s good bro❤😢❤
Dude you're such a good guy!! Braxton you got to hang with the coolest guy ever Brax. What wonderful parents. Stay strong mom and dad. Heaven just gained another angel.
Come on, man. You gave that little guy the time of his life and the opportunity to meet and hang out with his hero. You did a magnificent thing. I don't know what, if anything, comes after our time here, but you made the short time he had special. If he's anywhere, he'll never forget that day and your generosity.

Fly high little guy
My little girl lost her battle to brain cancer. She loved watching your videos. We spent her last months watching you together. Cancer is not fair! But thank you for being there for us at the time and thank you for being here for me and who knows how many people. Keep up the good work brother. You inspire so many people. You make a difference in this world!!

First may God bless this family. I'm honestly searching for help. My granddaughter has rett. It's a horrible thing. Make a wish is granting her wish. However she can't talk. How do we pick a wish. I'm sorry I don't know where else to ask

R.I.P Braxton ⚰
This made my day, even though I cried it’s very special to me because I recently had my grandpa die of cancer and I felt the same emotion to when my grandpa died and Braxton. At least they will be happy in heaven.❤
Of all the adventures Braxton could have chosen he chose you Jake. You've made big impacts on people your biggest impact was for Braxton. You made his world the best it could be. Your greatest and most valuable gift is your time. You took time to give to Braxton and his family. You truly are an amazing person and a gift to this world. I'm sure Braxton will be with you guiding you to treasure. To the family this world is too imperfect for a perfect angel. His earthly mission is complete his angel mission is starting. God has great plans for special angels Braxton is one of them. Lots of love to all.
We miss you Braxton
dat so sad and  canser its so sad :( dallmyd your the best person for dat kid
Dude this made me cry’s so hard even when I didn’t watch it😢😢😢
Heaven has gained another angel, Rest in peace Braxton.
I'm so sorry Jake, but he'll remember you and he'll be in your heart, you're such wonderful man to help him have a wonderful time with you it was great seeing you with him finding treasure he really enjoyed it seeing his big smile 😁  Seeing you like this is good because you are sensitive that you really cared about him alot! Love you for that!  Keep doing what you love to do Jake.

I just watched that video yesterday. It was great to see him so happy. He will be missed but at least he isn't hurting anymore. rest in peace buddy.
😪I'm so sorry! He was a sweet little guy! I just watched that video with my 6yr granddaughter two days ago.
Rest in peace little bud 🙏 💚
Rest In Peace 😢
You are a good person rest in peace Braxton😢😢❤🫡🫶🫡❤️‍🩹🫡
Rest In Peace 😢❤
Cancer really sucks. It's so unfair especially with kids. You gave him an awesome day and I'm sure his family is grateful to have that memory. You're a man with a big heart. Not everyone would take time out of their day to spend the day with a child. Seeing him talk about how you pick up trash you find has to feel good to know that you're setting an example and making an impact on other people by doing this small thing to make a difference in the community to pick up trash to make a better place.
🥹❤
It’s ok he will always be in your heart
He is in a better place now and don’t be sad because he is in your ❤🥹
😢❤❤❤❤❤😥
i cry no joke we will miss you Braxton i am so sorry i am cryimg just from tiping this if i had money i wood love you help we will miss you and we love you RIP
imagine diying
Brother be strong. Read the Holy Bible it will help You understand that some of us are meant to be with our Father quicker than most people.  Second thing must be said though that US has the most toxic food and water on the planet and the high cancer rate is not a surprise and something needs to be done. Otherwise more and more children and their families will suffer.
God chose you for this position. You know you can handle it or HE wouldn't have given it to you be strong and good courage for the Lord your God is with you.
Your compassion and love for Braxton is so very loving. God bless you.
You are a good man bro
This made my heart break man poor kid :/
I’m so sorry jake i hope u get better soon rip braxton

What happened to Braxton was terrible and I wish he could have grown up to have loved his life to the fullest. At Least he's in a better place and can rest knowing he met you Jake.  What you did for him was so selfless and I would trade places with him too, I hope your doing well and I hope this comment make what your going through just a little bit better.

Jake, you’ve got a great big heart. We all know this was hard for you to make this video. I’m very proud of you for sharing your thoughts about Braxton. I lost my first son when he was very young and like him, and because of you, Braxton will live forever in my heart with my son, David Foster. God bless you Jake and God bless Braxton’s family. Like you Jake, I’m shedding visible tears but it’s raining in my heart. Braxton, we’re all glad we got a chance to meet you.  Love you brother.
Long live Braxton❤️
NO matter what else - You are an AWESOME guy! Braxton was very lucky to meet and spend the day with you! You are Exceptionally humble with a hugely caring and compassionate heart. God Bless you. You touch more people than you realize with your experiences and efforts! I have only found your posts in the last 3 days, but have been basically binge watching every episode I come across! I ray you continue to touch lives in such a positive and promising way! o7
As soon as I seen the video tag I started crying, i didn't want to watch this but had to.  He looked like a amazing sweet kid, my heart goes out to the family, no child should suffer or have to go through such things.  Just know what you did for that Child was amazing and truly you made him happy and gave him something to look forward to and fight for.

Sorry man feel bad for you…….R.I.P
😨😰😥😢😭 I'm so so so so so so so so so so sorry😨😰😥😢😭
No no no hé kent die  no no noooo
As a father of 4, I pray to God that I die first than all of my kids. This is a such a hard situation.
Jake, you restore faith in humanity. My condolences to you, and Braxton's family.      R.I.P. Braxton.
I wish you could come back alive It sucks if you have cancer a lot
I'm sorry for you Jake I wish you didn't die And I'd like to describe the video cause I like that cause I watch both videos
I teach a special program for kids with complex medical situations. Obviously managing the day to day health stuff is number one, but besides that, the only priority we emphasize is that every single student finds a moment of joy every single day. Sometimes being “happy” is impossible in these situations, but a life full of joyful moments matters more than you can imagine for sick kids. It sounds to me like Jake, you filled Braxton’s life with countless moments of joy. That’s something that will continue to carry his family through the hard days! Take comfort in knowing you brought comfort to all of them ♥️
R.I.P. braxton
we will miss him
if i lost a kid like that i no your pane love you braxton miss you it is good that you had a good life
Damn man, no little kid deserves that, Poor little dude. People out here all depressed and sad for the littlest minor reason but bro over here never let his situation get to him. Kids attitude is inspiring.
So proud of you Jake. It was truly an honor to do this for Braxton. He chose well, and you went above and beyond. Kudos buddy. This event will stay with you forever and your a better man because of it. RIP Little Man, RIP........

Jake, I would like to start this out with you are an absolutely amazing person and I normally don't comment on much at all but i felt like this was a good time to start. You and that baby was so cool together. His eyes glowed when around you but so did yours when around him. It was a beautiful experience to see. It hurts my soul for an innocent child to get cheated out of life but I know he is up in Heaven jumping up and down Everytime you find some treasure. Now your biggest fan is watching over you at all times. Thank you for all that you do for people. You are truly an inspiration for me and I'll continue to watch your videos. Keep up the outstanding work you do and just know that you are making a huge difference for many people and the earth. Stay cool!!
Well done Dude! I worked as a social worker for hospice for 15 yrs and that by far is one of the nicest things I've seen. Thank you for sharing this and I'm glad this boy and his family touched your life as much as you touched theirs. We need more people and actions like yours today. Thanks

This is so sad I’m so sorry I am praying for that family. 💔🙏RIP BRAXTON
God Bless the family and all who loved Braxton.🙏🏻❤️
Hop the family Allright
Nothing makes me sader then seeing a kid suffer
Nothing makes me cry like a baby more than when I see animals and children suffering and/or dying.  There's nothing more painfully sad and unfair than seeing the most innocent and loving among us, (animals and children) hurting.  Because there's nothing you can do to stop and prevent it, except just to be there with unconditional love kindness, which is exactly what you did for Braxton.  Try to find some peace and solace with the understanding that you did that for him, despite how painful it is for you now, so that he was able to forget about his struggles and just thoroughly enjoy the time he spent with you.  Braxton no longer is in pain, struggling, mortal, and fearing the unknown.  He's now living in total immortality and eternal joy and peace.  There is only love, with no more suffering...for Braxton.  For those left with his memory, their sadness but only because we selfishly can't see him again.  Yet he's now everywhere seeing everything and knowing how much he still is loved and will always be forever.  RIP little dude.  The world will never forget you buddy.
Rest In Peace Braxton
So are you okay now did you see the kid
And what happened to him
I'm so sorry Jake that the kid was your friend
Braxton is always with you Jake

Jake you are a wonderful young man and Braxton chose you as his hero so feel honored and if you want to cry when you feel the pain just let it all out. Braxton is no longer hurting or in pain and where he is at he has millions of beautiful crystals all around him and he is with the best of hero's ever. Keep up the good work sweetie.
Lots of love is being sent that family’s way. What a wonderful young man that they had in their world ❤️

Damn this enough to make a grown man cry 😭😭😭 this is so sad
Typically, I would leave something similar to what everyone else is saying, something I'm sorry and what not. However, as sad as it is he is gone from us now, this fine young lady is in the house of the Lord in eternal paradise, with no worries, and nothing to bother him. A truly better place. So long as he is there, in the hands of God, all is good for him, I assure you all of that.

Rip in piece Best kide
Rip Braxton
Rip 😢🙏🥺
I am truly happy to see that Braxton chose you for Make-A-Wish and you made him so happy, and it was even his biggest dream! It is every little kids dream to meet there role model’s(fav.YouTuber) in real for something and it means so much to them.  I have just lost my grandpa to Diabetes 4 weeks ago, and I can relate to your & Braxton’s family sorrow. My family has a history with both diabetes & cancer in every generation, so they are really watching me to make sure that I don’t have cancer(girl) and have lost a lot of people to both of them                                                                                                                                                             Rest In Peace Braxton
You and him are great
You really needed to get that out. I feel you, buddy. I hope you got people IRL who supported you, because even if you don't show it, that kind of stuff hurts the most. Despite the short amount of time you spent with Braxton, you did your best, especially showing him a good time and making his wish come true.  It's really hard when you realize the person's gone and the feels hit you. It might never leave you but that's ok. Just think about speaking up to your friends and people around you about that, if you feel down again. Sorry if my comment reawakens that, too, but I just wanted to let you know that you're an absolute unit, man. I'm sure the kid left an impact as huge as the one you left in his life, and that shows how much a fantastic person you are. Keep doing what you do, and don't live without any regrets.
omg 😭😭
He loves you so much and that’s why he wanted to hang out with you because like you’re the best person in the world like you don’t just take care of the likes and the rivers you take care of all of us so actually my name is Harper and just letting you know I love you and just thank you for doing all that stuff for us God bless you🫶🙏🥺❤️‍🩹🫶🫶❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rest In Peace little when 🙏🏻😭 god loved him a lot and still loves him today goodbye
R.I.P Braxton. Your in a good place now.🕊🕊 I’m sure Braxton loved spending the time with you💔. I’m sure Braxton will be watching you forever ♾! Braxton loves you❤️! Love from Australia.🇦🇺 sending hugs x 🥺
Much love RIP Braxton
Why two sad deaths first technoblade but then this pops up on my recommended why YouTube WHY U MAKIN ME CRY😢 Rest In Peace
Jake I am a grown man of many many years, and this video tore me apart.  But I want to explain not as much with sadness as I didn't know the little boy, but to see the effect it had on you and what you did for him.  Out of everyone he could have chose, he chose you.  That has to be the most amazing feeling in the world.  A feeling that very few will ever experience.  Man, you have inspired so many people.  I have hundreds of dives now all due to stumbling upon one of your videos one day, and then I watched them all.  I knew I had to learn how to scuba dive.  Now I help people recover their lost items. I clean up the lakes, I record many of my dives, and to be totally honest, its all due to how you presented what you do on Youtube and who you are as a person.  You inspired me.  For that, I thank you.
Rest In Peace Braxton. You will forever be missed.🕊❤️‍🩹
R.I.P little angel 🕊

Such an amazing rollmodel keep doing what you do rip Braxton
Turn that rock into a necklace
As a single mother of two girls 4 and 10, it scares me everyday that my cancer will take my life, and there's not much support or help for us struggling with cancer im working my ass off to make sure I give my two kids the best life I can, but it breaks me that I'm to weak to be able to do the outdoor stuff we used to and that if I didn't have to work 3 jobs I'd be able to have the energy and it's just touched my soul hearing this story and I'm putting this video on repeat for the day I can't donate but I can help in that way. Xoxoxoxox love and prayer 🙏 ❤  all my love goes to them.

i didn't even know the kid and i haven't cried in 7 months, yet this made me cry harder than i have in probably 3 years. I don't get why kids have to go through this stuff, they don't deserve it, they should be free to at least get their childhood. I am so sorry you had to deal with this, Jake.
We're sorry Jake. Rest In Peace Braxton
Sorry i can't wach this video any more beacouse this too sad but respect for you and him and his family

This shows that you are truly a good man real men cry obviously this little lad touched your heart and you made his day well actually made his year possibly and his parents will always remember the fact that you went out of your way to make sure you made him happy life deals us and fair hands and takes people that should not be taken away earlier than they should be and you help this young lad realise his dream there’s not many people out there would do that and it’s not like you’re a famous TV star you’re a YouTuber with a big heart

Idk what to say but I was crying through the whole video
God, I'm not very emotional, but after this story it broke my heart...
Seeing this video made me 😭
I cried so hard right at the start we love you Braxton
Rest In Peace Braxton🙏❤️
This is so sad I'm going to cry so bad right now

Braxton ur a tuff boy 🙏 🕊
There is nothing worse than buriing a child. If you don't cry about this you're not human. I wish Braxton's family strength. God is now watching over him until someday everyone is reunited. I cry just thinking about how bad such a situation must be when your own child fights such a battle and in the end doesn't make it. I am so sorry for their loss. I'm a father, too. So I can relate to the pain.  Stay strong as a family, Weidman's. Sending love from Germany. Rest in Peace, Braxton!
He looked like such a great kid. Jake your awesome it looked like he loved spending time with you R.I.P Braxton 👼
Don’t cry jake
So sad R.I.P Braxton you are one of the most great kid in the world

Soo sorry to hear that;  My condoleances to Braxton's family. He was such a brave , little warrior. May he rest in peace in heaven. Kudos to you Jake for making a difference in his life, while he was still here and helping his wish come true. I can see how much of an impact he made on your life. It is the hardest thing to lose a child to any illness. This video will always be there for the family to remember the bright little Braxton on one of his happiest days in his life. May God bless them and help them be strong. God bless you too Jake for all your help for Braxton's family.
You are an epic human, Jake. We definitely need "Kickin' butt with two Ts" merch as a fundraiser!
Really no words. God bless Braxton, God bless his family and God bless you Jake. Very sorry for the loss. Thoughts and prayers.

I am genuinely crying.

Even though I don’t know him I hope he rests in peace knowing that he got to spend time with you and you also made his wish came true he is looking out for you and going on the adventures with you in the future he didn’t deserve to die he’s lucky to have met someone as kind and as thoughtful as you he gave it his best and your probably his hero I mean his wish was to spend time with you and he got to do just that, I also understand how you feel when my great uncle died, I know he was not as young as Braxton but I got to meet him a few times and I got the news while I was in school too, I know it’s not the exact same thing but I get how you feel

You made Braxton happy at a bad time in his life. You seem surprised that he wanted you for his make a wish but I can see the goodness in you as do many of your YouTube community. You did something amazing for him..and his family, so be proud of yourself and one day you’ll see each other again 😊😊
Braxton was a good kid and you made his wildest dreams come true he loved you and your videos vary much and hoped to see more. R.I.P Our firend Braxton 💖💖

Жалко конечно, так же как и сотен детей Донбасса с 2014 года,которые погибли от обстрелов городов украинскими войсками, только вы молчите об этом и потокаете украинских фашистов дальше убивать детей…
Watching this video made me value my life and notice how selfish I am I don’t even know this kid and I already feel terrible like I did something terribly wrong to him. So every like I get for this comment will be the amount I will be donating for him.
Rest In Peace little guy. Sending all the love to the Weidmans 🙏🙏❤️❤️
❤❤❤😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😚😚😚😙😙😙😗😗😗
????????
RIP Braxton, Sie werden in Erinnerung bleiben
Rip🥲🥲🥲
Rest in peace, Braxton. 😔
Jake I’m so sorry it’s taken me this long to watch this video! I feel very sorry for Braxtons family!!! I’m so very glad that you were able to bond with him so closely. May the good Lord watch over you and Braxton eternally!
"kicking Butt with two T's" maybe the best saying of all time. R.I.P soldier!
R.I.P Braxton now you don't have to suffer man you are 100% healed my friend ❤ 🙏
WE LOVE YOU BRAXTON!  💌 Rest in peace.
Rest in peace little dude
I so sorry that's all I can think of
Omg I'm litarly balling my eyes out
You are such a sweet person
sorry to hear that mate
@Jake I don't know much about you, I've only seen a small part of your videos. You wonder why on earth Braxton wanted to meet you of all people?  And the answer is actually super simple. Because you are who you are. You are such a good person and you have such an enormously positive aura! Always friendly, never a bad word about anything. You are dedicated, smart and authentic.  Don't think that 10mio. followers watch your channel, because it is so mega interesting, how someone fished garbage from rivers. But you are not someone! You are the one who insires, who is engaged, who takes responsibility! My everyday hero.  I am convinced that Braxton also felt that. be very proud of your self God bless you and there family.  R.I.P Braxton ❤
Braxton you will forever remember
I`m so sorry! He sound like a great kid!!!❤️😔
Hes treasure hunting with Jesus now may he Rest In Peace
😔
I’m  sorry man
I Hope he Wil get 999999999999dollers
Dont CRY😭😭😭😱
😭😭❤❤❤😭😭 R.I.P. Braxton we loved him 😭😭❤❤❤😭😭
You gave the boy the best day of his life you should be very proud of your self God bless you and there family ❤️
What a great person you are (: , you made this lil boys day in so many ways. You have given him strength as long as it was possible for him. He's been the happiest soul that there can be left, because you helped him make a dream come true
RIP Braxton God bless ur family And Jake u r truly amazing at everything you do God bless u Jake
Hope you fell better and rip Braxton he was great like you and we got your back

You know it’s bad when a grown man starts crying. RIP Braxton ❤

I have never heard of this kid. nonetheless it was a tragedy. he was just happy. he did what he wanted in life. he had the best day of his life. don't feel sad because it's over. be happy that it happened at all. He was. Smile, just for his memory. he was most likely smiling in that very last day.
you are the best you care so much
I was crying during this video
This is such a sad story, R.I.P Braxton. No more suffering now little guy, so cool what you did with him Jake. I hate all cancer so much, i lost my dad 3 years ago now, it still hurts so bad. Sending love to Braxtons family ❤️

Hi
I hope Braxton is living in a much happier place, more safer place, and even tho he has sadly passed away so soon. Braxton we will all miss you. Rest In Peace
You gave him his dream you made his life he will remember you up in a better place than down here and you have helped him live his life by a complete life. You did a good job just remember he is your life long memory
Dw :) he’ll always call you his favorite, he likes u like a brother, he knows he can look up to you :)
I watched that video and I wished him the best of luck battling his cancer, and I felt really bad for him. But now he ended up dying and It saddened me to see his death occurred when he was a child and he didnt even get a chance to live his life to its fullest. But now he is in a better place and he is safe up in heaven.

I am sorry about your friend Braxton
Love you Braxton RIP😢

Rest In Peace😥
you made hes live amazing jake ill beth he will be dreaming of it up there💫💫💫R.I.P.
😢😭😭😭😭😭
This earth is not our  true home. we  are briefly passing  through Heaven  is our real home.  all our pets we had  through every lifetime  family, friends everyone we have met  for short times they have all gone back  to the true God who created ALL!! someday when time is right they will be given back to everyone.
“For God so loved the world that HE gave HIS only begotten SON, that whoever BELIEVES in HIM should not perish but have everlasting life..... It's that simple my friends, put you faith and trust in JESUS, HE suffered and died to save you, we all need HIM as SAVIOUR because we all have sinned and fallow short of the glory of GOD (Romans 3-23)
Jake,  in our lifetime  we have lost  loved ones to all kinds of  death we are  all still together  wherever we go they live  on in ours hearts, dreams and all of our memories past, present and in the future  when we will be reunited in  Heaven.
Angels come into our  lives for a purpose.  when they go back to Heaven.  we we are never  the same. be comforted  Jake you made a very  special friend you met each  other briefly  Braxton will be with you where  ever you go in your  journeys.👼🏼👼🏼
For this little boy you where a big super hero. You made his life a little easier for the last moments on earth. But also made a new wonderfull friendship with memories that last forever.
<3 rest in peace
You sir are a good man.  This world needs more men like you.
Idk i think i just see a crying kid
Rest in peace Braxton.   God made a special place for you.  My heart goes out to your family as you were sooooo important while you were here for that very short time.  I hope your family can feel all of the hugs they are receiving from Jake's followers.  God bless you.

You're a good man with a big heart.  Thank you for sharing your light with others especially with sweet Braxton. ❤️

I don't understand cancer, but especially when a kid has to fight that battle.  Thank you Jake for making his wish special.  Braxton may you rest in peace, and prayers to your family.    I thought the kicking butt with 2 t's, meant the butt that is spelled with 2 t's since he was a kid and wouldn't say ass.
this video was so sweet keep doing what your doing Jake!! ❤️
Rest in peace little braxton
Kicking Butt with two T's probably means one T in his name and one T for the Tumor he got right? However, Braxton is a champ. No child deserves to pass away this young. We'll remember you !
RIP

Bless your heart. You are an amazing role model and for Braxton you were his superhero. This story will touch other younger souls and help them to live by the example you set.   Dear Weidman family, I am so sorry for your loss and I know that there are no words I can say to make this hurt less. Just always remember that you did everything possible to give him the best life. I do believe he fought extra hard because he had your support, comfort and love. He is your guardian angel now and will never be far away. He is in you hearts and if you close your eyes you can see him anytime you like, and you will feel his hugs. A child's love is forever. He will live on in our hearts forever too. God bless your hearts and heal your hurt.
I feel so bad for you and his parents 🙏🏻

The way your honesty, positivity and energy flows through you and your video's inspire people and you are a great example for many.

Keep on doing what you do, stay yourself and you will be helping others even if you cannot see or feel it, trust me you do really good to people!

Mate you have such a good heart. Honestly I don’t cry much but I cried with you. Life sucks sometimes. I just recently lost my cuz. I’m still grieving.
I send all my love and best wishes to the family. i know the pain of losing my sister to caner. There is days it is hard but as time has moved on I have learned to love all my time I had with her. The good and Bad. If Braxton wa anything like my sister I know they are both in a much happier place looking down on us wishing the best for their family. The love in their hearts will always live on in all of us.
Its ok to cry man! I'm so sorry about ur loss. He's in a much better place now, and his suffering is over, and he can be free. He wouldn't want you to be upset.

hi DALLMYD
;u
To the family,  I'm sorry and I know that nothing  I or anyone  else say or do will help with the pain and loss. But remember this, you helped him in a fight, you gave him strength for a battle that some have to go through alone. And he is at peace, he is looking  down upon you and smiling and waiting for you. he will be there when it's time to meet again. And D you have every right to feel this way,  but you gave this young man happiness, hope and so much more love than he realized because  his story touched  not just your heart but all of ours as well. He had a bright and fighting spirit. He shone brighter and hotter than so many of us. And to Braxton, you have touched so many peoples  lives without  even  knowing it, you are an explorer, and now until you meet with your  family  again you have a vast new place to explore. and hopefully  we all start kickin butt with two t's. From a no one in Texas, let kick butt with two t's and live our lives with a smile  like this young explorer  extraordinaire  did.
Rip Braxton
I feel so emotional because jake was crying
I’m going to put down a like 👍 I don’t know if it’s the right move

That one small child made such an impact on your life just as you made such an important & special impact on his life. You have no idea how many lives you have touched & changed for the better in some way no matter how big or small. You go out & make these videos with your buddies all over the world having fun, doing what you love to do & what you have such a deep passion for. Then you share those videos with the world after some careful, time consuming, tiring & skillful editing & guess what? You are one person that has changed a portion of the world!!! YOU DID IT!!! YOU!!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!! DON'T EVER let anyone change that in you. That is why that one small little boy had a wish to be with you. He wanted to grow up to be just like you. You inspired that sweet little boy to also want to change the world for the better. There is something about you. You are so very genuine. You are so humble. You are so extremely kind-hearted. You are so sweet & playful. I love it when you play with your dog, Treasure, or when you cuddle with her. It's just the absolute cutest!!! I have only recently stumbled upon your channel & I thank God that I did. I have thoroughly enjoyed every video I have watched of yours so far. And yes, of course, I subscribed. I love what you are doing. If I were about 50 yrs younger I would love to be doing the same things right there with you except with the alligators. LOL DON'T EVER doubt the impact you are having on the world or at least a portion of the world. You are living up to your user name. 😊 Much love to you & Treasure. 💕🐾💕 God bless you & always be with you. 💞✝️💞
Poor kid 😥

I am From India
Jake, your input and time spent with that young man was life changing for him, I take my hat off to you and all I can say is RESPECT Brother. To the Weidman family, the loss you suffered is immense and profound, no parent should have to burry their child or children, this does happen and it is a heavy burden, take comfort in knowing you did everything for Braxton in his living years and find peace in his memory. May his name never be forgotten and memories of him live on forever.
This is one of the saddest video.Rest in peace Braxton 🙏

RIP, Im so sorry for him
لقد عرضتم الفتى للهلاك بعرضه على شاشات الانترنيت دون حصانة، نحن المسلمين نؤمن بأن العين حق، هكذا علمنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، هذا الطفل كان فريدا مميزا في سلوكه وقد تجاوز سنه وعمره بكثير ولذا كان محل اهتمام الكثير، وحين تردد على الإنترنيت نهشته العيون الشيطانية الحاقدة من حيث تدري أو لا تدري فكانت نهايته إنه في الجنة بلا شك ولا ريب، نبينا علمنا أن نقرأ أدعية خاصة بالأطفال؛ لأنهم عرضة للعيون الشريرة وقد تم عرض ما في الطفل من إيجابيات رائعة على الإنترنيت وعلى مستوى عالمي أي على مستوى عالمي تمنكت منه العيون الشريرة الغاشمة فهي لا ترى الإيجابيات والمحاسن لتدوم وتبقى لأصحابها بل تتمنى زوالها من حيث تدري أو لا تدري، لذا علمنا محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم أن نقول (تبارك الله) أو (اللهم بارك) وأما بالنسبة للأطفال فعلمنا بعد أن نضع يدنا اليمنى على رأس الطفل أو الطفلة ثم نقول ( أعيذك بكلمات الله التامة من كل شيطان وهامة ومن كل عين لامة) ولا نرفع أيدينا حتى نكمل الدعاء تعازيي لأسرته وعوضهم بطفل مبارك صالح خيرا منه آمين.

Rip Braxton love you buddy even tho I’ve never met you
Jake, I've noticed your absence from YouTube, and I wanted to know if you're okay. Something like this can really get into your soul and cause long-term problems, and when people don't care to check in on you it can be far worse. So I'm offering my ears if you need someone to listen. Hoping you're okay, from Jenifer Church.
I am sorry to hear about that  Rest in peace Braxton 🙏 🕊

It was a great thing that you did for Braxton I have watched all your videos ever since I seen your videos on snap
Rest In Peace, Braxton 🙏🏻

When I realised what happened I felt shocked
I hope Braxton will Rest In Peace and I hope that god is on his side which he always is.
May Braxton rest in peace and for every kick but with 2 t's
I watch your videos because they're fun and exciting. The main reason is because you have what most have forgotten. Respect !
DALLMYD, I am so sorry for what happened and I am sorry for his family. I sat in tears when I watched this. I hope Braxton has a good time in heaven and I hope he is doing well. I hope that y’all reach to 1M in this fundraiser. All the boy wanted is to have a good time and hang out with you, but unfortunately he had a brain tumor and he couldn’t do that. On the bright side least he’s is not in the hospital suffering from it. REST IN PEACE BRAXTON!
One of the last things that he will remember is being with you and treasure hunting! You are amazing!! Rest In Peace Braxton💓
I hope he will have a good   time in heaven😭
I am so sorry for your loss😢
Rest in peace little man you will be gone but not forgotten you in a better place now,you filled up maney people with joy.❤

He could've chose anyone and he chose you and you were the best choice. You did follow up trips and you really cared for him. He made a lasting impact on you and you made his dream come true. You're a real good guy thank you.
May God take good care of him he will always remember you R.I.P (P.S. He is probably looking down at you from heaven thinking of how great you are;) )

Jake...."kicking' it up with 2T's"...means living life with 2 thumbs up! You may not know or see or believe it...but you are a true inspiration to everyone!👍😎💪💪❤
Braxton lived a great live (Rest In Peace) we will always remember you
May he be safe in heaven. May god take care of Braxton. Rest In Peace, Braxton. I feel really empathetic, we all feel the same emotion that you feel.
I’ve been passively watching your videos for a while…After watching Braxton’s story and what you did for his family, I am now an officially subscribed fan. What you did for that little boy was amazing and you clearly had love and admiration for him. You are awesome. I hope his family is able to find a measure of peace knowing that so many were routing for him and them. RIP, Braxton. Keep watching over Jake and keep him safe while he keeps doing his part to make the world better. God Bless.
He's always going to be with us in our hearts

I am so sorry for all the people who have lost children to cancer or any other terminal disease.  As a childhood cancer survivor I know first hand what a lot of them go through when fighting a disease.  My heart 💗 goes out to everyone who is touched by such tragedy.  It is hard to loose someone, but even harder to loose a baby or child.    Life is Short, Make it Sweet!

He will be showing his crystal to everyone up there, amazing kid rest in peace
when I saw that text showing that he will be buried with the Crystal that you gave him I started crying 😢
So is it finally going to happen where your going to act as an adult??? Not go and pull on people's legs as they are floating down a river, or use a alligator head to scare people, life is short, don't give someone a heart attack for YouTube views and money, keep the horse play for friends, leave innocent people alone, keep pulling garbage from lakes, rivers and streams
braxton i am so sorry
Jake this made me feel sad i even shed a few tears 😭 🙏 and I just wanted to let you know you made his life so much better🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Aw thats sad that you lost you bud 😭🙏 rest in peace Braxton
May he rest in peace 🙏🏾 🕊
There is a reason the Lord put you on this earth and it was to impact this little boys life.  You blessed him beyond his dreams.  Braxton is in the arms of Jesus now and He is now in the happiest place imaginable.  We may not understand the ‘whys’ things are allowed to happen, but God does.  We, as human beings, have to put our trust in the Lord and try to learn from Him by reading His Word and praying to Him constantly.  Over time, understanding becomes much more clearer.  God gave each of a purpose in life.  Try to put your trust in Him for the future.  That is what Braxton would want you to do for him.  Keep using your incredible platform to honor God and give Him the Glory.  You did a wonderful thing for Braxton and I’m sure there will be more in the future.  God Bless You.
Rest In Peace Braxton ❤❤
Rest In Peace Braxton 🥺❤️❤️

Ephesians 5:4 in the Bible: nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving
John 3:3 in the Bible: Jesus replied, very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born again
Hang in there man grief his hard but the lord will guide you threw it and you just got to see the light at the end of the tunnel

Not every hero wears a cape. For him you were a hero. RIP Braxton
Dallmyd is a true legend. he’s such a hero to so many little kids. that’s one dream a lot of kids have is to be a treasure hunter and it’s such an amazing think to hear that Jake is helping to full fill little kids dreams. bless your soul Jake
M'y childhood Friend is gonne too thing is in a better place💯❤️😭
RIP little Braxton. I've never liked and subscribed to a channel that fast. I know how it feels to lose a loved one to cancer. My aunt passed away from pancreatic cancer. It was extremely hard to watch her suffer through it. Especially as kind of a soul she was. This video hits hard and is a cold hard fact of life, however it's also things like this that teaches us what importance life is to one another. Never take a moment on this earth for granted as its a blessing in itself just to wake up and be a part of it.   Hang tough buddy. You did a good thing and I'm sure Braxton is up there bragging about how honored and cool he is to have gotten the chance to hang out with ya. Keep it up 💪😎
Good video man you is a good person.
Rip🎚
His eyes were probably super dry after this video
Man thats sad 😥😞😔😢😪

Your generosity has touched us all ❤ God bless you.
rip bro
Not only did you set the comments to "Newest First" instead of "Top Comments" to drown out any hate, but your thumbnail is just terrible. You already have Rest in Peace in the title. You don't need a heavily edited thumbnail of you crying to get the point across. RIP Braxton, and hopefully you're doing better than you were down here on Earth.
RIP braxton

Your a great man
Rest easy Braxton, fly high and watch over Jake.  Jake you are an amazing person for everything you are doing. You made Braxton’s day that day. It’s always a pleaser watching your videos. This one really hit me hard.

It’s so sad things like this happen, but you at least brought some joy to him and now little dude is always gonna be remembered by 100s of Ks of people who never even knew him, and praying for his family during this time. That’s some pretty powerful stuff when you stop and think about it. You’re an awesome dude for doing this man.
Super emotional I feel for you my brotha

It's so sad because kids nore Anyone should have to go through this
If there's an afterlife, you know he's going to have all the best treasure hunting spots figured out by the time you get there, and he'll have all the subs ❤️
His sub and him will always be with you [Braxton Weidman 2/1/2022]
I'm so sorry for the loss of him. Remember though, you are the reason why his life dreams were fulfilled. You are the inspiration that that kid had, and the motivation that kept him going for as long as he did. You are a hero, Dallmyd, and I want you to truly know that. You are the inspiration for children like Braxton all around the world just by your amazing personality. Me and millions of other people are so proud of you for what did for that child, and in my book, you are an absolute hero. Good luck with this horrible situation and I wish you the best  -A long time viewer
Man....god bless.

Rest In Easy Little one
My little cousin Tyson passed away from DIPG a little over a year ago and today he was on my mind a lot. My Aunt Maggie and Uncle Colt did everything they could to give him the best memories any child could ever have the day they found out he had cancer. The pain it caused for my family was awful but I know he’s in a better place now and that gives me peace of mind. I’m sorry you had to go through this man.
Amazing story, amazing kid and amazing YouTuber. He’s in a better place with Jesus Christ. That kid will be waiting for you in heaven until you meet again. God bless you.
😭
R.I.P 🥺🥺😔 I’m sorry to hear that
🥺
Rest In Peace ❤️

you are a wonderful and kind hearted soul Dall. I hope you truly know how amazing you made that kid feel <3. being the person who is called apon at a final hour is unimaginable too me and the stress and feelings would be immense. just know whatever happens for the rest of your life you truly did good for someone and made them smile when times were hard.   I have no idea who you are but video's like these are powerful for the human soul both for viewer and poster, I really hope you give yourself time too look back at the good you did so you don't get stuck on the bad. we all love you man <3
Much respect and loved for doing such a awesome thing for a young angel.

And to hear this story just proves that nothing in life is guaranteed and all we can do is push forward. I absolutely love watching your videos Jake keep pushing forward man and would love to do a video with you one day.

When people cry on the internet it 89% of the time seems Ingenuine, screams “give me your sympathy”, looks desperate, looks completely pitiful. Not this time. Nope. Nope. Damn dude . Great video truly
Rest in peace braxton❤️❤️
You’re amazing! What an honor it was for you to be able to do that for him . I have so much respect for you . You have no idea how many lives your videos touch . It really hits home for me because I’m a mom to 2 little boys that love watching your channel . I can’t help but feel like your doing gods work and don’t even realize it . It’s very hard to find videos that are appropriate for little boys to watch and I have to thank you for having good wholesome content. ❤️THANK YOU
he was the coolest kid ever miss you braxton
I'm so sorry i had a friend who died of cancer named Yuki i feel ya i know what it's like to hear a message like that.

RIP🕊
I know I’m just seeing this but this is really heart breaking and I got really emotional watching this video seeing how this kid was growing up wanting to do what you did and was so happy having the experience of meeting his favorite YouTuber and making his dream come true and you made a major impact on his life and his family’s for making his wish come true and beyond that.
rip brazton. died too soon but no soon enought to expierience the best of the best before he passed away be proud you took your time to help this young child out to make his wishes come true
When you showed the message about him and the crystal I lost it and teared up, so sad man.
rest in peace braxton ill pray for your family  🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Rest in pease Braxton
Things like this make it so difficult for me to believe that there is such a thing as a "merciful god". No child should suffer like this or be subjected to terminal illness. It's about as unfair as it gets. But I guess we're not supposed to understand.
I started crying myself... o7 Little man. He was a true soldier
Rest in peace little angel
He’s in a better place..saving all the treasure he wants Rest In Peace😔
Rest In Peace I feel bad if I got a random text saying if I could go I would rip😔
Rest in peace Braxton! I'm crying right along side you Jake. To see that smile on that little boy's face is everything. You made his day and made him feel special!
I am sorry for the loss :(
Hohoho
this is so heartbreaking, but seeing the support is amazing. this video has more than the original. honestly just restored my faith in humanity a little. God bless Braxton, his family, and Dallmyd.
damn man i cried watching this bro i just feel so bad man rip
Your a good dude. Made that kids day.
Don’t cry whatever happened just suck in your tears be a big man I’m a girl so I need to suck in my tears took😭🥺😢
May Braxton rest in peace DALLMYD you did the best thing you could ever do for him you made a friend and that’s something a lot of people may not have
Damn this is now getting recommended to me rip 😔🙏
I want Braxton's family to know  "the world lost a absolutely amazing kid who chose to only see the light in things not the dark the world lost an amazing fighter"!
Rest in peice little man
So sorry for his family's loss and I'm sorry you lost a new friend who looked up to you. I can only imagine how you must feel  to have been thought of as someone with such importance that before a child took his last breath, his dream was to spend a day with you.  Well brother,  just so you know, you are a great man. You're a gentleman, kind hearted enough to give to people in need, you're an inspiration to others and someone that I would be honored to call a friend and I have never met you in person. Keep making a difference brother. Everyone is proud of you.  Semper Fi !!!!  - J. MacKenzie
i feel so terrible i felt heart warmed when you made the video with him
Rip Braxton
rip lil buddy live a good life up stairs
RIP Braxton
So glad you got the opportunity to share yourself & time with him! It matters so much to kids!
First time I've cried in ages, it really is amazing what you did for him and how much you cared for him. I wish you and him the best.
God bless you Braxton’s family! Our thoughts and prayers are with you all!
God bless you for what you did for that special little guy! He loved you and you loved him!

Man it's a blessing
Rest in piece kid
You are such a good person. I can definitely see the pain it’s caused you, but I know he was so happy. I know you changed his life and you’d given him something that he’d always wanted. You changed this kids life, and you’re such a wonderful person for that. And to his family, the loss of losing a kid leaves a hole that is hard to fill. You all are so strong. Things may not ever be 100%, but you all gave him the life that he always dreamed of. Rest In Peace Braxton, I hope you’re somewhere living out the treasure hunting experience you deserve. ❤️
keep moving forward bro you are awesome you're a great guy
Rest In Peace Braxton😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

R.I.P Braxton your are amazing, and DALLMYD you are one of the best people in the WORLD,I’m super sorry for you jake
Rest in peace
man thank you for sharing, you are a great guy
We need more people like jake
Sorry for the families loss I lost my sister to cancer she had a brain tumor it was hard on me as a child. I feel for you as no parent should have to bury a child. May god bless this family and bring them piece in this time of grief. Rest in peace Braxton.
Man this made me pretty emotional   I wish braxtons family the best and you did the right thing by giving him a amazing day
I’m sorry but these are things that matter. Stop donating to save some random endangered animal, giving money to planned Parenthood, and donating to political parties. Saving our innocent children is more important than any of that garbage. Stop giving money to perform abortions, and save our kids. Born or not.
L Bozo 💀
Rest In Peace Braxton
You made him happy. Rest In Peace Braxton
I’ve made a small donation. It’s amazing to see that the fundraiser has already exceeded its target. I sincerely hope that the funds raised provide some comfort and support to the family after their loss.
Rip😢
I have a small tumor in my foot
my prayers go out to his family, his spirit lives on within you and beside you, thank for you giving him such amazing moments, you are each other's angels and god bless you for your passion and your heart, thank you for everything that you do for us with amazing content and hard work, i'm grateful and appreciative. god bless you.
We will miss you braxton
rest in peace Braxton, thanks for doing all you could to bring him better days, to the family and dallmyd from a sentimental stranger, god bless.

I have been a follower since the beginning.  I never post but feel compelled this time.

Jake you did so much for Braxton in a little time you had with him. I’m so sorry for your loss and his parents loss. You made him so happy and had all that time to impacted his  whole life with the little time you had with him. I know he love everything you did for him. I could just see that he was a happy kid and never took anything ungrateful for. He was a good kid and he didn’t deserve this. I would trade my life if I could. Once again I’m so sorry for you and his parents loss.
Jake you are such a kind man to do all that for him. He is watching you from above. Just keep it up he will bring you good luck on all of your other adventures. RIP Braxton ❤🧡💛💚💙💜

Well Done, God Bless

rip
Good life my man and Rest In Peace ✌️😔
Rip Braxton .
As a grown man, I’ve got to say I never cried so hard after watching this. Been putting this video off for a month now but thought it was time. Rip
This is extremely sad
Rest in peace little warrior
With as many evil people in the world it sucks to know that someone so innocent and kind gets taken away. RIP lil man
RIP lil man hope u have it great up there❤
Rest in piece Braxton you will be truly missed
I'm not sure how to react to this video. first off you are a great man for doing this... dedicating your time, and life to helping this child fulfill his life. 15 months ago my brother was diagnosed with leukemia and was told he had about a year left to live before cancer would eventually kill him. So we were told if he could do one thing that's always been his dream what would he do and he picked meeting Dale Earnhardt Jr. but time had passed since then and my brother is gone now but seeing that you can manage time and awareness for Braxton is a HUGE koodos to you. thx man keep up the good work.
rip lil man
Rest In Peace Braxton. Thank you Dall for giving him an amazing day, we need more people like you in this world.
I’m a grown ass man crying on a Saturday morning watching this. RIP Braxton
Who cried 💔😭🕊
Wow man I’m hurt the boy didn’t make it smh 🤦‍♂️
rip
RIp sweet Braxton. Dallymyd, pure heart.
dall you made him happy for one day of his life be proud of yourself you did what you could too make him happy for one day and he is not in pain anymore
I don't think you realize what you did for that boy and especially his family. They will be eternally grateful to you.
What an amazing kid!
Rest in peace.. i cried with you. ❤️
Rest in piece man
It’s. Ok
Reset in peace❤️❤️😓
❤🙏
He could have done anything, and to an adult, who would likely consider these elaborate vacations and big celebrations, it may feel like such a small wish; but to Braxton I'm sure it felt like the coolest adventure quest with his celebrity hero finding the greatest treasures.
❤
Respect bro.  rest in peace Braxton
RIP Braxton
You know my name Braxton
Rest In Peace little man, Jesus is holding him tight, I just pray for his family that they will take comfort in that. God bless you guys.
Heartbreaker. :(
I reapect Braxton he is a fighter and I hope he is doing good
We love braxton rest I  peace and thought will be remember
Rest Up Little Man
this is hard to watch, watching you crying i cant
Rest In peace 🙏
May Braxton rest in peace I know just how you feel my sister is fighting a brain tumer she has made many friends on her journey but two of them have past away so I hope everyone out there fighting cancer I hope you all win that battle and keep fighting
I    hop       you        feel          betu
Keep on Loving
Rip buddy I wish u fly high bud
Rest In Peace Braxton. I am so sorry that you had to go through that, but you were his wish! You made his biggest wish happen! And that’s every kids dream. Rest In Peace Braxton and your soul will live on forever!

എനിക്കും കരച്ചിൽ വരുന്നൂ
Only $8390 raised when there’s over 2 million views and it’s been a month? That isn’t even a cent a person. Just under half a cent, ridiculous
Im sorry for your loss, you have to experience all the pain but without time to prepare for it.  Still, im glad you gave the kid a good time.
May his memory live on!
RIP Braxton 🥺🥺 sending prayers to ur family 👪 ❤.
dammit, may his memory live on, rest well buddy :( :(  <3
Don’t think I ever cried this much   RIP Braxton🕊
It's hard when it's an older person, but harder when it's a kid. No parent should have to lose their child. This just was randomly in my recommendations, but that's fine.   Cancer is a terrible disease, I lost my wonderful Nan last year to it, you hear of people losing loved ones to cancer but you don't fully know what it's like until it's you who loses someone close.    My deepest condolences to Braxtons family, may he rest peacefully.
What a blessing.  This really touched my heart.  God touches us in doesn't ways. Mahalo for sharing Braxtons story.
it's a terrible day for rain
Rest easy legend, you will be missed <3
Kids should never have to go through things like these. Life is simply not fair.
poor baby :( i didn't know him but would trade places in a heart beat, no ones should have to go through that especially an innocent kid   wishing the best for his family, i'm so sorry you have to go through this he seems so great 💖
rip
My condolences to Braxton's family it sucks loosing a family to cancer but may God bless them and bring  them the peace in their hear the lost a son, brother, cousin but they gained an awesome angel that will watch over then Rest In Peaven Braxton #f**kcancer
it was hard watching u cry man nearly had me bursting out rip braxton you be missed little buddy had a whole life ahead of him ❤️🕊😔
Rest in piece Braxton we love you
This came too my recommendation but rip brax and stay strong
God damn it all. Please lord take this suffering away. Haven't we suffered enough?
Bless his little heart 🕊️❤️, fly high Braxton he'll be watching over us all🥺🕊️❤️
RIP Braxton💔🕊
He was literally so happy... after dream coming true.... sorry to heard about BRAXTON..... RIP...Brave boy❤️❤️❤️
I’m send love❤️❤️ I’m sorry to hear he’s was  such a fighter
its sad that a kid died but remember there are millions of kids dying from hunger around the world and cancer is the minority if someone has to get my money is the hungry people that die in just 2 weeks not those who need expensive therapy to be held alive for 2 weeks
Braxton will forever be in our hearts, all though we never met him, he still impacted our lives
hope we can have a world without cancer soon
You’re a good man. This is why a kid would use their wish on you. He saw that you love what you do and he loved the same thing. RIP
May you Rest In Peace Braxton god is there by your side I give all my condolences to your family with ❤️.
what point of make a wish if they all die anyway
The original video had me in tears as a father of two young boys seeing you go above and beyond for him with all the phones and other treasures made my heart swell. This news is absolutely heartbreaking. You changed their entire family’s lives. Keep up the amazing work Jake.
I can tell this one is gonna sting a bit already.
sad very sad also sad this thumbnail things people do for clicks
Poor Braxton, such an amazing person its amazing how much we all take for granted. When sad things like this happen it really shows us to just live life how you want to live life!!
，salute to him
Rip little man he will always be loved
Rip little man. But come on dude, you really have to film yourself crying and put it on the internet? I really feel like people only do this stuff for clout
rip
To Braxtons family. I'm so sorry for your loss. My prayers are with you through this horrible time! :(
sorry for your loss. and god bless you. what you did for that boy is so inspiring. Youre a genuinely good, selfless person!
He was a good kid. You for filled his wish and made him happy. May he rest in peace
❤️
I feel so bad for his family, keeping them in my thoughts and prayers
Thank God for people like you, sir.  It's easy to forget sometimes that there is still love, goodness, and kindness in the world.  Thank you for reminding me.
R.I.P
There is always more joy in giving than there is in receiving. Rip ❤️😔
I’m so sorry bro 😔😔😔
Rest In Peace everyone watching this is so sad and want to support Braxton an his family
I cried with you! I just want you to know as a mom its refreshing to have my 2 boys watch your videos.. I tell them in a work full of @$$holes be a Jake❤️ thanks for being you!
Your special person Jake!! You are worthy of the special gifts .to show your worthy and your an amazing young man you are. Sometimes people just need there worth.  And you have amazing heart . That lil precious little boy soul will live a long time because of you ! Wanna say alot more. Keep doing what you were born to do sweetie!  Love watching you and all your friends and adventure.
It’s pretty incredible that you provided him with such an awesome time, you gave that kid hope and happiness for a day and that is ALL that matters
Man I am sad about him and you I hope you have a good life and feel better soon
Jake I want you to know that when it comes to loss people who loved the lost one always think it's their fault okay just know this is not your fault and all of us loved Braxton and the butiful impact you made on his life. This is not your fault we are all here for you. Rest in Peace Braxton, Fly high 🥀🕊️
This was so sad rest in peace Braxton.
What an amazing video was hard to watch but you did him proud man.  RiP
I’m sorry this happened I feel so bad
Awww i feel super bad rest in peace
I have had so much  respect for you but I can't say how much respect i have for you. You are an amazing person.
Insane amounts of respect. Rest in peace.
I hope you have a great day today 👍
Dude I’m at work crying like a little baby 😭. And other coworkers are looking at me & I don’t care ! May good be with you & his family !!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
As I clear the uncontrollable tears from my eyes & my heart skips a palpable beat...the inspiration of Braxton's story is now within me, the way I'm sure it is with every other person who has witnessed it. The lesson shown to me here is... Live life to the fullest of your abilities...whatever that is for you.  When we look back at our lives, it's at that point we can say,  "Yep, that was a life that was, Kickin' Butt With Two TT's"!!! Thank you Braxton.  Godspeed...🙏 Healing thoughts to his family.
I work in healthcare and I have seen a lot of death. It’s things like this that I really rely on my Faith in Jesus Christ. It gives me peace knowing that those who are young are definitely with him in heaven. God blessed that child through you and I’m sure it was the best time he could have had. If you are not a believer I hope that you can give Jesus Christ a chance. God Bless
God created men to lead and to save the kids incase mama turned them into corrupted when she no longer listens to her husband and her kids will recreate carruption
this is really hard to watch. rest in peace Braxton
Jeez this was just recomended to me ... wow/...
Respect to braxton he is a good kid R.I.P Braxton....
Rest In Peace. Hope the family can take comfort in the good memories. Makes you cherish life a little bit more.
Prayers for the family.
Get rid of those microwaves one of the biggest thing to cause cancer in kids ( and every odd keeps them in there house this is just my opinion) my kids don't know what a microwave is because a little toaster oven does the same thing but doesn't leak radiation like a microwave I'm pretty sire there banned in alot of different countries I could he wrong on that but who knows also if you keep a microwave and read the book itcomes  with it says your suppose to have it checked every year buy a licensed person and who do you know who has a microwave for years amd never get it checked and never replaces it (EVERYBODY)
I’m so… :(
Rest in peace little boy🕊️..... In heaven inshallah
:(
I pay my respects my guy. Haven’t watched your videos in two years but helped me go through my senior years at school. Thanks for YouTube recommended in bringing me this video.
Love your heart brother and I’ll be praying for you and the Weidman fam!
❤
sad
rest in peace man :((((
I’m so sorry to hear of Braxton’s passing. RIP little dude. Jake you are such a good role model, teaching kids not only to treasure hunt, but to take care of the environment as well. You are such a genuine kind guy. I’m not surprised he chose you. Thinking of you and Braxtons family during this sad time.
Rest easy sweet boy
R.I.P
Just let tears run down....
Jake, you did more for him than anybody else could have. Thanks for sharing his story so we could celebrate his life with you. Our tiny minds can’t even fathom the treasure he’s diving for now.
R.I.P :(
Im so sorry
Dang I’m sorry man I lost my mom to cancer when I was 9. I know what that’s like. Hang in thier and keep inspiring us. Wishing his family all the best. Thier in my prayers and thoughts.
Gosh I'm so sorry for the loss of this sweet boy. This video broke me down but also just reminds me of how beautiful some people are in this world.
What 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Love you Jake
Rest in peace <3
I know there are no words I can express to convey the sorrow and loss you are feeling, God himself knows this. But if I may say this instead, Jake you are a good man, with a kind heart, go forward knowing you made a real difference in a childs life, IMHO there are not many things that can compare to that. The world *ABSOLUTELY* needs more people like you in it.
yeah man i can imagine this is tough but you did a very nice deed giving him a little taste of life. and  the saddest part of it is,children are not suppose to get cancer at this young age. unless big pharma companies like johnhon and johnson  mixing baby powder with high carcinogenic asbestos powder ,you wonder why ,   dont believe me look it up. and if i was you i would not get the shot because history made it damn clear , big pharma can not be trusted and a mistake is made ez ,oeps we put in some wrong ingredients,sorry but we are not liable. next pls...
It's ok man  I know haw you fill
Oooh hell nah what u say to me
im gonna replay this as much as i can
You are a good person
B♥️
Does the family have a Go Fund Me?

May he Rest In Peace ❤️
RIP little man..
Rest in Peace little Braxton
RIP little guy.. you’ll always be remembered..
RIP just learned about Braxtons story, very sad, very touching. Glad he got to live out his wish and further help those with similar conditions. You wont be forgotten.
I can only watch half of this video I am in tears watching this. Cannot ever imagine how his family must be feeling. So sad.
Fly high, little man.  Some people take decades to make the smallest impact on humanity. Some are so incredible, they change the world in just a few years and that was Braxton.
Rest in peace loving boy,may he find all the treasures he wants
Rip little buddy! You made this kids life  Thank you for making his day
Rest in peace <3
rest in peace little man
much love to you for giving this beautiful boy the best day of his life. I am certain that he loved you and looks up to you as a hero. He was so innocent and it is so unfortunate for him to leave this beautiful world with you in it so early. You made him the happiest he could be my man. that is what matters at the end of the day.
well respected man and also rest in peace braxton
God bless your soul
my heart goes out to to Weidman's an yourself Jacobson. l think the answer to Braxton's question on the most valuable thing ya ever found would be friendship, what ya do with it...appreciated it. God Bless...🙏🤟
he fought with a smile on his face, he will be missed.
You are such a generous and genuine soul. You cared deeply for that boy and he definitely appreciated everything you did for him. May he rest in paradise, prayers to the family. He was so young :(
💚
This was so heartbreaking
This hurts me it’d be so hard for me to be a kids make a wise choice. He was awesome I’m sure he had fun and I’m so glad you went to see him again.
You have such a good heart man! KeeP up what you are doing! It's changing lives
He is in a better place now
Rip
Rest in peace little man
He’s with all our family and friends now doing all the treasure hunts he can ever imagine and it’s all in memory of the life and memories not only his family gave him but you also bro I bet he was the happiest kid
RIP Braxton. Thanks for giving him that experience, it meant a lot to him.
I have no words that’s actually terrible I was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cancer last June and we’ve made some money from a benefit recently and I’m gonna try and donate some money to his family that kids a legend R.I.P. Braxton
Rest in peace. To a child that most of us didn't know about, the kid that made Jake happy and have fun, the kid...that left this world to early, he had a lot more life to live, he Braxton's family, i hope you are all doing well, i wish you all good health, may Braxton be well in heaven.   A kid that i never knew, but I got attached to. Jake, I would like you to know that there sadly wasn't anything you or we could have ever done, but at least we made his wish come true, and it was to meet his favourite youtuber. A child that was always happy and laughing, playing games with his friends, is now in heaven.                                                                                   Fly high Braxton.
RIP Braxton Your are a legend
youre truly a great guy for doing this! waht a beautiful and tragic story

I’m so so sorry to here this he was such an awesome kid I feel so bad but we all know it was his time and he is in a better place now and I what you to know I will pray every day for him and his family Rest In Peace 😭😭😭😭
R.I.P Braxton. I was a make a wish kid but I am lucky enough to be here. I realize others aren't so lucky and I really hope that they rest in peace in heaven. You are an amazing person Dally and thanks for making this kid's dream come true before passing on. RIP Braxton.
When the kid asked at the last part "what was the most valuable thing he found was" I think the answer is when you found him ( Braxton ) and gave him the best experience he had when you were with him treasure hunting, his dream came true. RIP Braxton.
RIP
death is part of like, you cant have life without death, so sad that the most beautiful souls are taken from us so early.
RIP Braxton

You made him so so happy 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
You sir are a true angel here on earth. Please for the sake of all humanity don't change who you are and how you express yourself. Crying isn't a sign of weakness and if only more people were like this it would be a better world. It takes a true man and I mean a true man to cry and especially reveal it to everyone. You're a wonderful compassionate person and everything you do is in an effort to help others. It's wonderful what you did for Braxton and RIP little man.
Rest in Peace Braxton😭😭
RIP ❤️
Braxton was a real fighter ❤️
Rest In Peace Braxton
Braxton got what he has always wanted, I did not see this vid until 3 weeks after you uploaded but I support you man, keep doing what you can, he got to do something he’s wanted to do with his hero, his hero is you, and I’m glad you got to spend the time with him, rest in piece Braxton, will be missed but never forgotten

I would like to say thank you to you for making his biggest dream came true.may his soul rest in peace 🕊️ and may in his after life he becomes the best treasure hunter as he can be.
"What is the most valuable treasure he has found" I would say the connection you shared on the special days you were able to spend with Braxton, because from this day forward, little man will always be with you on every treasure hunt you go on. Let your emotions flow, feel the heart ache, the tears, the joy and love. Feel it and hold it close. RIP Precious Braxton. So much love to his family as well.  <3 <3
Braxton May God rest your beautiful soul. My thoughts & prayers for your family.  Jake, you are amazing!! Your humbleness of not knowing the joy & happiness that you bring to your viewers & all around you makes you even more endearing. Much love ❤️
I am so sorry you had to go throught this. I have a friend battling leukemia right now, and its hard. His leukemia is almost gone but he has a gene that can bring back the leukemia again. So im praying for Braxtons family and loved ones! S

Rest in peace little fighter. F@CK CANCER.
I lost a loved one due to an brain tumor in 2018 or 2019 It's definitely one of the worst feelings in the world It's extremly hard to get past and accept the loss but you have to keep strong and live in their memory If you don't, it might get worse and the sadness catches up to you and you will feel depressed But if you just from the sadness and focus on the happiness you had together Sometime, someday the sadness will give up and you can live happily in their memory thereafter
Rest In Peace lil guy.

Jake you’re going to make the most amazing Daddy one day. The love you can show for a little boy after spending just a few days with him shows that there is love in this world. There really does need to be more guys like you. I am so sorry for the pain you are feeling, made me emotional watching. Sending so much love 😭💙

i am so sorry, this breaks my heart. i cannot imagine the things his family and friends are going through right now. you make your platform a place for nothing but positivity and help. and we all love you. Braxton was a fighter and lived his life, one that was too short. He is not gone, and will always be with us and i hope that no one ever forgets that. my prayers go out to anyone who ever knew Braxton. i am so sorry. keep making the world a better place in memory of Braxton.
R.i.p from uk
Losing a loved one is the worst thing in this world. No words in the world can describe how you feel. But I hope my words give you some strength. Braxton is not gone, he will always be with you! He will cry with you and laugh with you! He will look down on you and always carry in his heart what you have done for him. Live for Braxton he will always be a part of you. I hope and pray for you. Warm greetings from Germany
RIP

Dude.. I never cry at anything but this did make me cry a lot I really hope there is peace in his family and RIP Braxton. What made me cry most was the fact he was getting buried with the crystal YOU Gave him knowing he really was a big fan that really enjoyed knowing you and he may Rest In Peace. He’s probably watching you and your videos from heaven and god bless their family. And it’s a good thing he was able to meet you and have a great time and have the best friendship with you. RIP

Life is short, keep the ones you love close and focus on the positivity and love you can spread around those you love. Ignore as much negativity as possible and live life like there is no tomorrow. Rest in Peace Braxton. 🙏❤️
This hurts...I'm not a frequent around YouTube, but I remember seeing this video, and now to see this...my heart hurts, so much. Thank you for making Braxton's dream come true. Thank you for being a light in his life. I cant imagine the pain they're working through, but may peace surround the family and relatives. To you Jake, you're strong, keep your head up and keep doing things like this for people. You're an inspiration to all and its a pleasure to be able to see how selfless you are. God bless, RIP Braxton ❤
Life is so unfair. You were such a gift to this little guy and  brought joy to him.  He brought to you love and gratefulness.
I don't know you on a personal level but I can see you're a good person. We need more people like you. I'm sad to hear about Braxton. Children should be off limits to everything negative. It's not fair. My thoughts are with you and his family. So sorry.
Did he really die ?😢😢😢
So sorry for the families loss RIP😢
Respect for Braxton all the way
Did he die?
Your so kind

“Kickin butt with 2 T’s”. You need to make merch with that quote on some clothing and give all profits to the family.

My condolences to you and to Braxton's Family,  Braxton Rest In Peace little man, I've no doubt you'll be treasure hunting in heaven free and happy. A Tiny Flower that was loaned not given, to grow on earth but to flourish in Heaven.
Go kick but with 2 ts and we will miss braxton
Oh man this is so heartbreaking😞 I watched your video with Braxton when you first published it and you could see by his face how much of a hero you was to him🙏🏻 Your such an inspiration to many people, it’s such a lovely thing your doing for Braxtons family too. He’ll be looking down on you all, sending all our love from the UK to braxtons family, friends and your team! Rest in paradise young man 🙏🏻👼🤍💙
R.I.P Braxton
Thank you for showing the raw emotion of a wonderful story. I just subscribed to your channel. Now, go kick butt with 2 Ts!!
You made him so happy thats what matters.😭😭
I’m crying it’s so un fair kids don’t deserve this f cancer man we just gotta love each other and make the best of it you never know when the end is rip
Kicken but with 2 T's                               -Braxton Rest in peace. You are with our lord and have no more pain and only happiness. 🙏
Dude I know the pain, my brother just died from Covid. However I have comfort in knowing that the world we live in is more magical than any book you could ever write. He's not gone, he's just done his journey.  Don't feel sad as you were his joy and he would not want you to be sad. He would want you to keep doing what he loved and what we all love.....seeing you enjoy yourself with your friends. So here's to rejoicing a wonderful young man and thanking god he was here.
one sub = one pray for him
Sub for braxton please do it for him
I’m so sad he was nice loved you and I almost cried like bye little man we all loved you man the stupid brain tumor

Sorry what happened.
I doubt you'll ever see this. But this is exactly why I adore you. And my kids always wonder why I say he's so cute. Not like you're hot and whatnot but you remind me of a kid that I'd be so proud to have. Your personality and your true self makes you adorable to me. You have the biggest heart. And I know this was not a Happy video to share but this is 1000001 reason why I truly adore you as a human being you are such a kind person and I'm sure your parents are so very proud of you and all your family and that's what matters most. Keep it coming cuz I know your future is bright.
Siento mucho lo que pasó...un abrazo desde España.

Little Braxton did do great things with his life. He's influenced you Jake, who has a huge influence on a ton of other people. That's massive! Sometimes, it's not what we do in our lives, but how we influence others, for the better. Good on you, Jake. You've got a good heart. Braxton's watching you on high and he's loving every second of it.

Keep your head up bro.  It's a sad ending story but I hope that little guy made you feel special and this YouTube thing was meant to be.   R.I.P little Braxton.  He'll definitely be with you on all your next finds and looking after you

I watched that video. You did an incredible thing for that kid. I actually knew someone from my high school class who was in a similar situation as Braxton. When Make-a-Wish came to him and offered to grant him a wish, his wish was for his older sister to get a scholarship and go to college.
You should be happy at least you could make his dream come true you are a good person

Rest In Peace and you have done your best and his wish came true.  as a human being somehow when the time comes we all have to go but, what you have done will never goes waste, I understand your feelings and emotions. Never give up no matter what and always think positive and help for other kids wish fulfilled in the future. For example like that kid. You are a true super hero for those kids which their wish and dream come true.

Thank you for sharing this.  You brought joy to Braxton. Hold on to that memory.  😢
In your pinned comment below, you mention Braxton saying you were his hero, but I just wanted to acknowledge the fact that, in using your platform to be this vulnerable, emotional, & raw, *you are also being an excellent example of positive masculinity for all your viewers* and I admire and commend you for that. We need more of that in this world. ♥
Fly high Braxton. Rest In Peace

Fly high Braxton, fly high. We will see you again one day. “ For as in ​​​Adam​ all ​​​die​, even so in ​​​Christ​ shall all be made ​​​alive​.” - 1 Corinthians 15:22
rest in peace kid <3 you really inspire people man!
Rest in peace Braxton 😔
he watching us
Rest in peace Braxton
Rest in peace little braxton.  the Kicking butt with two T's part, that hit me man..
Dear Jake. Your heartfelt video touched my heart and hit very close to home. I started watching your videos because of my Son, Joshua. Joshua was 8 when he introduced me to your YouTube Channel. Joshua and I would sit and watch your videos and adventures together. In September 2017 at the age of 9, Joshua was diagnosed with Stage Four Neuroblastoma Cancer.  The diagnosis was something that came out of the blue and hit our family to its cure. From the very start Joshua would assure us he was going to be just fine. He said "God gave him this disease so another child didn't have to suffer with it". Neuroblastoma is typically a Cancer that effects much younger children and not children's Joshua's age, but in rare cases older children are diagnosed.  Joshua fought for 4 long years and underwent many rounds of chemotherapy,  immunotherapy, radiations, surgeries, experimental and study treatments, stem cell harvesting and transplants,  and so much more. Joshua and I spent many hours sitting and watching your videos. It was our special time together. Like Braxton, Joshua was also eligible for a Wish. Joshua wanted a pool because he loved swimming and wanted to learn to scuba drive.  Due to the Covid restrictions at the time we were unable to have Joshua's pool installed. Unfortunately Joshua passed away in December 2020, just 8 days after his 13 birthday. My heart goes out to Braxton's family because I know the heartache they are feeling and going through. As a parent we are never supposed to outlive our children.  The struggle of watching your child under go treatments and surgeries is heartbreaking. I would have taken my Son's place in a heartbeat. I love that you took such an interest in Braxton and made his wish come true. You made his dreams come true! You are such a special man, for so many reasons, but most of all your kindness and love for others shines through. My heart breaks for Braxton's family and those who loved him and were blessed to know him. I'm so sorry this comment was so very long. I wanted you to know, that although you don't know it, you were a part of many special memories my Son, Joshua, and I shared. You are and amazing young man with a heart of gold. My thoughts and prayers are with Braxton's family and all who knew, loved, and supported him through his journey. May Braxton rest in peace and fly high as the angel he is now.
🤘🖤🖤🖤
Rest in peace 🕊️

RIP Braxton 😥😢❤
RIP Braxton the best treasure hunter there ever was. I'm so glad you were there to give him a special day that had such a great impact on him. As well as your viewers. We are all crying with you. He was just a kid, but he definitely lived life to it's fullest. I bet he is treasure hunting to is hearts content up there. That crystal made his day and he is going to hold on to it till the end of time. I bet he's going to be with you in spirit on all your future hunts. Also thank you for showing your raw emotions it makes you human. The fact he meant that much to you is what is so beautiful. Never lose touch with his family. They are happier more than you for your support. I lost my father to Pancreatic Cancer (wich isn't the same, but I was young. However every bit of love and support meant the world to me.

Make-A-Wish is dear to my heart I Have a Wish child she had a kidney transplant and is doing great prayers for this family!!!
My heart goes on, we'll miss you.
First of all, my heart goes out to the family of Braxton. And to you, for taking time to make a boys wish come true…  Braxton looked like he was a fun boy to hang out with. Im glad you got to make 1 wish come true for him. And I think he won his battle against cancer. He is free from his restraints of cancer and tubes. He lived his best life thanks to his family and you. Im glad I got to see a glimpse into his world through your camera lens…❤️. This can be something that his family can have out there to watch and keep reliving his best day when they need comfort. Best wishes to his family and you as you guys continue to grieve. Braxton, you fly high… rest easy…. You hung your heroes cape up here and gained your wings…❤️💔

I just stumbled upon this randomly,  I’m deeply sorry for anyone and everyone that new Braxton. Losing a loved one to cancer myself I understand to a degree how tough it can be. What you did for him is incredibly amazing and I’m happy you did that. To  him you were and still are the one thing that brings him the most happiness. He will be watching from above. Rest In Peace Braxton. “Don’t cry because he’s gone, smile because he existed” - We all love you!
i’m so sorry Jake. it’s hard going through something like that. i hope everything going well. ❤️
This made me sad but he got his dream come true too spend the day with you.  I lost a very dear friend of mine that had cancer.
I had a friend who was a make a wish kid, she passed away when we were twelve, the brightest lights really burn the fastest, RIp Braxton and Rip Aimee
I'm so sorry for taking such a great time with a kid
You know we are capable as adults to make moments like this anytime we want for kids out there especially our own, but for some stupid reason we decide , not today kid.  ☹  Thanks Dallymd for making me excited tomorrow to do a treasure hunt with my kiddo tomorrow after school!!
Heart goes out to Braxtons family, Keep your heart open D, keep  doing the great things you do !!! love from canada

He's In A Greater Place Now
What really got my attention is that sciences have invented all kinds of viruses to destroy humanity but no one cure from r this illness.      So many cruel people living and good people that deserve are dying. So sad.
Im like crying right now and im so sorry Really From the bottom of my heart im sorry  but im so happy seeing him with a big smile when you went treasure hunting  your so strong jake you can make this video Remember that all of us Love you 😘😢😭
Bro your going to make me cry fly high braxton
RIP Braxton💔
What an honor to make a child's wish come true. You're such a kind and generous person to spend time with him and make him feel so happy and special.
There is so much hate in this world and so much division. Yet we have these beautiful young children who are battling these deadly diseases that could teach us adults how to be better humans.  These children are so full of love and gratefulness and anything else don’t matter. We need to learn from them we need to honor them we need to do all we can as a society to make sure no child has to go through this again. My heart goes out to any child affected by this disease.
I'm so 😥
Rest in peace little buddy.
@Dallmyd God bless his family he is just a child really touch my heart😭😭😢😢 in Jesus name amen🙏❤💚💜💙💛
This video put me in tears

Rest in peace Braxton
To Braxton, that was his wish, to hang out with you, was a HUGE deal to him. It's hard to accept that you mean that much to another person who is fighting for their very life, but it's true. And it's a beautiful tribute to Braxton, and to you and who you are that this affected you as it did. RIP Braxton fly high buddy!! Jake, you're awesome!!

Omg did he die because I watch that video a minute ago 😪😪😥😥😢😢😭😭
My heart is breaking. Sending love to family.
He was such a sweet, brave, cool and cute kid. He was having so much fun in the treasure hunt video. I only knew of him because of that video, but this news made me sick and depressed. I can't imagine how you feel or especially his family. Such a heartbreaking situation but Braxton was a fighter and gave more motivation than most of us could give in a lifetime.  Rest easy, little buddy. I feel terrible for the family.

Blow this up to make Braxton’s parents feel better
This video really made me cry I didn’t know him but I watch all your videos and I’ve kept up with the little guy and he definitely is stronger than I could ever be like knowing that your sick and instead of being down he lived his best life the longest he could and living life with people in my family that has cancer any and all support I can give I’m going too I appreciate everyone and anyone that’s finding faith and the positive things in all aspects of life … we all lose so much in life and a lot of times it isn’t fair I just hope god faith and healing too the family comes as fast as they need it and too anyone dealing with a hard time I hope everyone keeps faith because life is a beautiful thing and we should cherish it and be kind always it takes just a little kindness everyday and the more we get people too be kind the more we can change the world for a better future for the ones we have too fight for … I’ve lost 6 of my family members too cancer I’ve been trough a lot if you guys would like too reply and leave a comment below mine I’d love too reach out and talk with anyone going trough a hard time right now because nobody is alone you don’t have too be we call unite and get trough everything together you tube and social media can be crucial too the downside of things sometimes but it also really makes great things happen and brings people together.. I love everyone in the world and I have no hate for anyone no matter what I’ve been trough or how I’ve been treated I care for everyone I hope everything can be okay and healing and the future bright for everyone god bless 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💯

We will always remember you Braxton RIP God bless 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🙏😭😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭😭😭😭😭🙏😭😭😭😭😭😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏
Do you remember You Braxton RIP God bless
This is why I believe being a YouTuber must be harder than it looks... Because when you're an influencer (AN AMAZING ONE AT THAT!) and when you co-operate with Make-A-Wish to carry out the wish of a kid like that... Jake you're an amazing man to do that with Braxton (R.I.P. Braxton) see I always say... I'd rather deal with the pain than to see anyone else in pain... so I can imagine how hard it was for you to read a message about an amazing kid who loved your stuff to pass away... It's really hard to hear about people passing away... especially pets or children... I am so sorry for your loss Jake and the Weidman family...
Rip God bless buddy 👏👏👏👏
You made a big impact actually because the only thing he wanted to do was be with you.
I know this is something but yeah a lot of other kids around the world couldn't live like him...at least he had a good lives, sending out loves to more kids out there who couldn't even eat and die to starvation, may humanity changes to *HELP THOSE IN NEED*.
Rest easy bud
Rip God bless
He was happy at least
RIP little man. @DALLMYD  Well done bro for being a good human <3
R.I.P Braxton never knew him I beat he was amazing ❤️.

I firmly believe souls are put in this planet for as long as their needed. We may not understand it, but the soul's purpose has been achieved and has moved onto  a new purpose. Be happy for him - I'm sure he is happy for you and is willing you on to keep doing what you're doing. Onya Jake!

May he Rest In Peace. 😔😔😔
We will remember  him
Braxton R.I.P I HOPE YOUR GOOD UP THEIR YOU GOOD LAD
It has nothing to do with or related to DALLMYD or scuba, but in the army when we lose something who fought till the end we say " 'Til Valhalla" Little Braxton fought hard and he had so many behind him. In some ways, it might be a loss but it doesn't equal defeat. It is only when we live in fear of that loss will the enemy defeat us and those who fought along the way. Jake I've been watching your videos for years man, I've watched videos of you and your friends finding skulls and getting bit by gators. You are a solid dude man, a good guy, and clearly a hero to many.
Thank you for having a heart for a child you didn’t know.
Poor braxton....fly high braxton😢🤧😿
Sad 😭😭😭
Rest In Peace Braxton, the world will miss you 😢
Rest In Peace Braxton 🙏
life is so unfair man… RIP little angel
Wish I could donate but my prayers are out to the family
Rip Braxton
Prayers to Braxton family as a parent I can’t imagine what it is to endure such heart ache! Prayers and luv from my Family here in Texas to yours
#4Braxton
I'm brand new here, but I can tell you that you made more than a little impact on Braxton's life. Despite him not fully being there during your last visit, the memory of your time together had to have been there as well. Rest in peace, Braxton. Fly high little man.
May Allah bless him and grant him jannah
Love you buddy. We'll see you in heaven Braxton
💔
I'm sure that Braxton was a great kid I hope he has a good life in heaven😞🙏
Its tragic to hear of young lives being taken to soon  fly high Braxton🕊
You're awesome, Jake. You meant something to Braxton and you made a difference in his life.
You can tell this shattered his heart to make this video and explain his situation
Thanks for giving him a day of fun!
rest in peace little buddy :(
My sincere condolences for the family may he rest in eternal peace and love.
Jesus Christ has that baby. See you in Heaven Braxton
Im so sad for braxton and dallmyd
One thing that always stood and still stands out to me is your positive energy. You gave Braxton the time of his life and he couldn't have wished for anything better to come true. It's a tough situation indeed and getting that call definitely sets your world on pause for a moment. But being there for him alone is already something to be incredibly proud of. And even though he passed horribly young, he also passed happily.   So here's a lot of love to you and Braxton's family from me and your community. ❤
Im super sorry braxton rip♥️
My heart goes out for you and his family
Rest in peace🙏
Rest in peace buddy, #kickbuttwithtwots
It's sad he passed away, but the good news is, he lived it to the fullest he could. I think the real treasure for him, was being with you
Rest easy little one
i am cryig rip
Rest in peace braxton xx
it deeply saddens me to see youtubers cry after hearing one of their fans pass away. My condolences to braxton's family.
May he rest in peace this kid is such an inspiration for all of us much love and support for the family ❤️❤️❤️
Rest In Peace little guy. Millions loved you.

You are beautiful person. Thanks you for being awesome.

Rest in peace Braxton 😞🙏🙏
Treasure hunting now with Jesus Christ in heaven!! Thank you Abba Father Jesus Christ, Holy Spirit , for blessing Braxton with eternal life.
I lost my grandma to lymphoma and lung cancer back in 2019, watching this video wasnt easy but just knowing that people act differently from 2 simple encounters, thank you for giving him the best few moments
I don't usually post on videos but thank you for letting this kid enjoy the one thing he wanted, you have a real heart and you truly made his wish come true. Keep being you, keep being an inspiration to these kids, not many people go out of their way for others. What a kind, thoughtful and genuine person you are.
Rest In Peace Braxton 🙏
What happened?
He lived a good life and he will always be with us.
Rest in peace, Braxton.  Thank you for what you did to help him enjoy life while he could, Jake.
Rest in peace Braxton. You made an impact on all of us, including Jake, and I hope you get to treasure hunt all you want now, you were a lovely child, and rest in peace buddy x

Braxton it is so sad to hear that you’ve passed away, and yet somewhat comforting to know that your wish came true. That was a darn good wish you made, treasure hunting is such a fun thing to do, and I’m glad you got to share that moment with the people you admired most. It’s so lovely to see pictures of you enjoying yourself being the coolest kid. A warm hug goodbye little one.

R.I.P Braxton Weidman
Rest in peace, you young madlad.
You did everything you could to make him happy. You are his hero.  I'm glad you two had the opportunity to meet and spend time with each other.  I can't imagine how much it hurts you and everyone Braxton met now that he is gone. You made his last bit of time here unforgettable. You influence many just by going out and doing something you are passionate about. Thanks for showing so much love to your community. Just know now you will always have little Braxton there watching over you when you treasure hunt.  Don't be afraid to talk to us about things like this. Your true fans will always be here for you and support your endeavors.  Loss is one of the most painful and emotionally draining things we as human go through. Keep your head held high Jake, Love ya!   And to Braxton's family I cannot imagine the pain you are going through. He seemed like such a wonderful kid that was full of energy and had a thirst for adventure.  Find comfort in the fact he is with the Lord now in his Kingdom. I wish there was a way for me to be able to ease the pain, but I know that it is not possible to stop missing a loved one. Sending love and prayers your way. Love you guys and gals! Stay strong <3

RIP 👼 🙏
RIP little buddy. ❤
❤
It’s Braxton’s video that reeled me in. You can tell that he comes from a loving family & thank you, DALLMYD for showing him pure love & friendship. I know what it’s like to meet a friend, have a deep connection, then lose them to cancer. In my case, our meeting was divinely orchestrated & we both knew it. I was there for her in a way that nobody else she knew could be, but it was her & that friendship that had the biggest impact on me. I think of her all of the time. You’ll be forever impacted by this little man & his legacy will live on in many ways. You won’t forget him & neither will we. By this, he lives on. ❤️
Rest In Peace lil Braxton, heaven gained another precious angel 😇. Sending my sincerest condolences to all his family at this extremely sad time. Keep doing you and spreading the kindness Jake. We just never know, no matter how small, those seconds, minutes, hours we share with people make such a profound impact on their wellbeing and life. A Special treasured memory! Xx
It’s alright he is watching over you and his familey I promise just because he’s not there doesant really mean he’s not here with you we love you and we are here for you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Rest in Peace Braxton. You are a Good Man Jake!

Rest in peace Braxton ❤️
With poisons in our air & food, humans hardly have a chance. Consider, really consider  saying NO, like we did  in 2018, to all  injected poisons distributed by the evil Rockefeller medical system.  When the scamdemic  came along,  we were not deceived. The evilll are killing up us with their poisons. They posted it on the Georgia Guidestones in about 1981. We WILL defeat them...it's them or us..I choose us,  God  chooses us. They are going down right now! Pray because it's God  vs  satan.
Poor guy
Rest In Peace Braxton may you Rest In Peace and let Jesus guide you  ❤️
My heart goes out to the family 🙏❤️. This is a truly beautiful moment in YouTube history. I thank God that he has blessed people with the platform to change other people’s lives. I think that Jake made a impact on Braxton’s life, and I know that Braxton made a huge impact on Jakes life. Rest In Paradise.
Stop your making me cry too😭😭😭
I have no clue who the hell you are, never heard of you... But you popped up on my feed. If you ain't a good person, I don't wanna know what the hell it takes to become a great person. 👍  First off, At age 31 I had a lung cancer scare....Had a DR tell me straight up, "I'm very sorry, we're almost positive you have lung cancer.." I'm sure you can imagine I learned my fair share about cancer.  And I was EXTREMELY BLESSED and LUCKY to find out I was benign. I accepted my fate at 31... Things became so valuable to me: a bottle of water, a rainy day, the tree's calmly flapping in the wind.   This kid and MANY other people actually have to battle this horrible disease. This kid was 100x braver than I was, and THAT my friend is amazing. You helped create that in him.   We MUST find a cure. The hard thing about this, is theres hundreds of different kinds... So its not like taking down just one simple disease. As technology improves, we MUST find a cure. This disease has no place cursing human beings, let alone an innocent sweet child. I wouldn't wish cancer on my worst enemy. We need to figure this thing out.   Anyways, you are a great man. You gave this kid his dream come true before leaving this world bro. Rest easy, and grieve safely man. 👊
Idk what happened but did he die
Fly high little dude
R.I.P. Braxton you are a strong little guy we all will remember you

I am so sorry
Your a good guy man
so sad man no one should have to got throught some thing like that let alone a kid
This video legit has me in tears!  You are such a kind human to do something so amazing for this little boy! Being a wish kid myself I know how big of an impact it makes on your life to receive such an amazing gift!  Not only that, but you keeping in contact with him and showing him the kindness that you did is amazing & I’m sure it changed his life! Thank you for being so amazing and being willing to make his life better.  I’m sure it means the world to his family as well.
May the Lord,  bring comfort to the Wyman family and to you!😭
he is dead 😰🙏🙏🙏
Rest In Peace Braxton.  I didn’t know you, but I will always remember your day treasure hunting.  Your smile will live on in our hearts forever ❤️

Thank you for taking time to create positive memories for this family and Braxton. As a father this really hit me hard and really makes me appreciative of the big and little moments that I have with my kids.
Just had a daughter and she got sick and needed to go the er and just seeing her with the ekg hooked up to her brought me to tears…. I can’t imagine what this family is going through, but even though I’m just some nobody, thank you Jake for all you do and for being such an awesome person and for giving Braxton an unforgettable day and for continuing to support this family. Rest In Peace Braxton.
This is so sad 🥺😢🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I'll admit I don't always have time to watch all of your videos but you are doing YouTube right! Your character shows through on every video Braxton saw it, I can see it and everyone else can see it. RIP Braxton 🙏
❤️
Green hearts for braxton 💚💚💚💚💚
He was a good kid rest in pease Braxton ♥️♥️
🥺💖
Losing somebody is awful, especially when it’s a kid. The way I cope with it is knowing how big of a privilege that it was to know them in the first place. I imagine a world where I would have never met them and how much more bland it would have been. They were a blessing while they were here with us, even if it was just for a short period of time. R.I.P. Braxton.
Rest In Peace little man
In memory of Braxton as well as Eliza, FROG YOU CANCER!!!!
What a great kid Rest In Peace Braxton
You are each other’s heros💕

I live in new jersey there are a few parks here called Jakes place. They were built by jakes family.  The idea was to build it so that handicap and/or kids with special needs could enjoy it as well as regular kids. It would be lovely to hear something similar called Braxton’s Hunt or something like that!!! RIP Champion!!!!

So sorry for your loss 😭😭😭
Rip Braxton gone too soon
he is looking down at u
Fortunately, there are people in this world, this distraught, broken world where we help those who are in need. People we never thought about, we didn’t know. But those people are the ones that we as fully functioning humans need the most. It teaches us how to treat those who don’t function to societies guidelines.   Side note to anyone who looks at this, I personally want everyone to do good in this world. Be the mentor, be a leader, and most importantly, look out for each other.
Rest In Peace Braxton 💚🙏🏽
Was fine till the text messages
I hope to meet him someday
RIP 😥

I cryed a lot watching this video  We love you Braxton

I first read about Braxton from a story presented by Rick Karl, a tv personality in Birmingham, showcasing Braxton's love for Alabama football. The display of courage this young man showed is an example to us all and how we should look at each day and know we are blessed with each moment. I give my condolence to his family. I lament the phrase "Kicking Butt with 2 Ts".  And Rooollll TIde Roll!!  my friend. Keep Bear Bryant busy in heaven young man.
RIP 🙏💙
Your a great man dude my condolences goes to there family
I am truly grateful to have been able to observe such an amazing feat of kindness on your behalf. I am also heartbroken from the news, as you have lost someone that clearly meant something to you after meeting him. He is a loss of all of ours and my deepest condolences go to you and his family. He will forever live in the hearts of his loved ones, friends, family and wide variety of your viewers as we all came to know and love and support him. Stay strong D, Stay strong. <3

The world would be awesome if everyone was like you and that is a honor to you to just show you what a wonderful human being you are.

You are A Legend DALLMYD. Thank for making Braxton's Dream come true. I know his family will cherish these moments you had with him forever. I have never done business with Make A Wish, but seeing how your experiences has been has inspired me to maybe one day do it too. Your committment and dedication with Braxton not just changed my life but so many others too. Continue doing what you do because I've been a huge fan of yours since 2015. My Absolute Love to Braxton's Family.
You are a great person for doing that for him and his family. Prayer's for all❤️

Make-A-Wish is an amazing charity.  My daughter has a brain tumor and was granted her wish to see the Eiffel Tower after she stabilized from her first procedure (craniotomy).  She has a deep fascination with monuments and statues.  While we have visited various monuments from coast to coast in USA, the Eiffel Tower is the pinnacle of monuments in her eyes.  Make-A-Wish made this wish a reality for her, along with many other historic monument visits in Paris.  Please consider donating to Make-A-Wish.  They truly do change lives, exemplify generosity, and most importantly, bring hope and a much needed smile to those who desperately need it.

Innocence is humbling in so many different ways. Children are a treasure that enriches all our lives.

Losing the kids is always the hardest. Takes so much time to get over it. Knowing and seeing what they could do in their life. I think some of the things the living have to keep having that reminder that they are not in pain or sick any more and that we need to live ours to the fullest and not hold back of seeing what is out there. Take care of one another and love. You have been an inspiration to many young ones. Keep it up. I think I found you because of my oldest who I lost in August 2021.
I am so sorry
Rest in Peace
rest in peace
Bless your  heart ❤️
Jake, you are an amazing person ! What you did for Braxton was so special . My prayers are with the family .  Keep putting smiles on these young peoples faces and keep showing them what you do best.

I wish the family and everyone that was touched by Braxton, the peace from the Lord that surpasses all understanding. The one thing that puts things in perspective is death, and as unfair as it is none of us are immune. There is nothing that can be said to make anyone feel better about his passing, but I truly pray that everyone has peace knowing he is with the Lord now. I saw this video pop up in my feed, it was very moving. I will keep the family and you in my prayers
Cancer is a peace of crap
Jake you are a legend don’t let this hold you down.Keep up the great work.
I lost my daughter two years ago, and that feeling is the worst possible feeling ever. Condolences to the family I hope they find peace in all of this.
God bless you for being his earth Angel
I know how you feel sorry he's smiling from heaven 😭😭😭😭😞😞😞⚰️

R.I.P Braxton 💚 I'll give you a green heart because it's your favourite color
I’m sorry for you and everyone ones loss. My prayers are with his family. Loosing a child is the worst thing that could ever happen to anyone so praying for his mother and father and family especially. It never gets better but it will in time become tolerable. In time you will be able to look at pictures again without breaking down completely and even be able to smile at the good memories. It will take time. I’m greatful you were there for him and were so willing to drop what you were doing to fulfill this angels dream. Not many famous people, youtubers, or internet people are as good hearted enough to share their time with another. Thank you for that. You are a good man for this.
Prayers to you and the Weidman family. This world definitely lost a wonderful kid but heaven gained an angel. Hopefully he is looking over you and his family. Thank you for all you’ve done!
Im pretty Sure God puts Kids in first place  always.
Rest easy buddy
Life’s so cruel man
Bless you my guy!!! Youre a beautiful soul !!! 💞💞🙏🏽 Big Heart

Kicking Butt with Two T’s 🥲 absolute legend Braxton. May you rest with all the angels little man . Sending love to mom and pop.this story touched my heart🙏🏽
Amazing to see you so vulnerable
Im sorry to hear that hapened
I liked and sub while watching this heartbreaking video, you made a dream come true. Seeing your emotion broke my heart but reminds me in this crewl world there is amazing people like yourself that made a kids wish come true, Rest in peace Braxton from Australia mate may we all go for a treasure hunt with you again soon.
God grants us just so many days, for Braxton it was time for him to be with the Lord, without pain and suffering! Let us rejoice that he was a part of our lives for the time he was here, the impact that he made and the love that he shared. As a retired PICU nurse, I understand the pain of loss felt. I had gone on vacation for ten days, returned to the PICU and was told that seven kids I had been a primary nurse with had passed duty the time I was gone. I so understand the tears, each of these children are an amazing blessing. For me, I tried to continue working in the PICU, but I was not strong enough emotionally and needed a break. I praise all the doctors, nurses and support staff who work with critically/terminally ill children. That work is the most demanding and yet rewarding work one can imagine. The families of the children are amazing, supportive and such a blessing. I thank God I had such an opportunity to work there. Braxton may you Rest In Peace forever more!
your heart bro, amazing<33
I feel for you man my grandmother just got diagnosed with stage two lung cancer no matter who it is cancer is the worst thing you could ever go through I hope you know that god has a special place for them and I hope you are okay
I couldn't watch this video bc my grandfather died a couple days ago and I had the same reaction  there in a better place God bless
Rest In Peace Braxton, I pray that your Family gets through this loss and that you will be remembered forever!
Rest In Peace Braxton
RIP Braxton you'll be missed
You have an amazing heart and soul my man, you really made it easy to see and feel how much you cared about him and how awesome a kid he was. He’ll be with you on the rest of your walk through life guiding you to change lives like you did his. Praying for you and his family.❤️

I don't normally get emotional but the first video was amazing to watch. The best out of all your videos. But this one choked Me up and my heart goes to his family.  I can't donate but I can watch this video everyday and share it to everyone I can.

This is hearbreaking rip lil angel
I feel you man.    I babysat a little girl with a brain tumor a 2 years ago.  I’m literally gonna cry as I’m typing this but she Wanted a brother to hang out with because she was an only child.   But here’s the messed up thing. The parents never told me she had a brain tumor and it I was destroyed when she told me about it 2 WEEKS before her death.  I remember 1 week before her death at the hospital she promised that when she gets better we can go and play at the park where we went for the past 3 months every day after school.       Out of all the death I’ve witnessed in my life this one was very depressing.  I’m sorry for the family’s loss and I’m sorry if this mentally affected you.   Trust me I was suicidal after her death because it was really unfair.  RIP and I’ll send my respects if they still have a go fund me page.  To Braxton: We love you 3000
Childhood cancer sucks. There are many like this in the children's hospital. I do my best to donate to St Jude Children's Research hospital if I can. 🏨 ☹😢

I couldn’t breathe listening to this. Rest In Peace Braxton life is just too short to waste. Nothing can be taken for granted as you said. Sorry for your loss.
Kicking Butt with two T’s. A mentally weak individual who is battling a deadly disease would say “I’m kicking but…” In Braxton’s mind, he was kicking BUTT and didn’t give up til the end. What a strong lad, my respect and condolences to him & his family
🥰🥰🥰😭😭😭 we love you Brandon you will always be in are hearts ❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰
Reast in peace BRAXTON 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

Rip Braxton fly high and spread your wings
So sad
In a number of ocasions i felt that life was unfair to me. But the fact that kids as young as Braxton have to deal with stuff such as cancer, just makes me ashamed to have ever felt like i had the short end on anything that has ever happend to me.  And to catch myself feeling miserable and not wanting to do anything, i'll remember Braxton's story. From now on, imma live my life kicking butt (with two t's).  May this little explorer rest in peace, and may his family find peace in knowing how much his story has touched us all.
Rest In Peace Braxton you were a good kid
RIP
R.i.p man😪👼🤞🏼💔
Rest In Peace Braxton, you made such an Impact on his life and never say u didn’t because you did, he looked like he had soo much fun with you. You have made such an impact on people, you were such an amazing person even not meeting you and only seeing you from a video you seen like such an amazing and beautiful lovey person as I have seen in the video, and caring person I’m so sorry that it had to come for an end but you got to at least do something you loved and cared about (kicking but with 2 t’s) even though I never met you or had seen u before you still made an impact on me. REST IN PEASE BRAXTON!

This is crushing. I'm so happy that he got to live out that day with you. But it's still so hard to have something like this happen to a child. It's absolutely heart breaking.

Rest In Peace Braxton
Jake, this is why you’re the greatest. Not because of what you did, but because of the genuine love you feel for him. You didn’t just make a video, but you made an effort to keep in contact, to visit, and to befriend this boy and his family. I’d say I’m sorry for his loss but he wasn’t a loss. Because of him strangers on the internet gained more love and kindness. Thanks for doing what you do. ❤️
Rip 🙏🏽

RIP Braxton
Rest In Peace Braxton, you made such an Impact on his life and never say u didn’t because you did, he looked like he had soo much fun with you. You have made such an impact on people, you were such an amazing person even not meeting you and only seeing you from a video you seen like such an amazing and beautiful lovey person as I have seen in the video, and caring person I’m so sorry that it had to come for an end but you got to at least do something you loved and cared about (kicking but with 2 t’s) even though I never met you or had seen u before you still made an impact on me. REST IN PEASE BRAXTON!

Thank you for sharing Braxton story & for sharing your heart!
Way too young! So sad! I feel for all of you! Jake, you are a hell of a guy for all that you do!
Rip lil man he up there finding more treasures ❤️
You made that kid's life better. Don't grieve. Be happy that he did what he loved with you. My brother also died of a brain tumor. All of us, family and friends, tried to make the best possible days for him during the fight and we did not give any sign that we felt sorry for him during his fight with that vicious disease. I don't regret what my brother and I went through together, but the only thing I regret is that he is no longer with us. He lives in our hearts and as long as we remember him, he will live. Heads up and brighten the day for everyone you come across. It's the most beautiful thing you can do for someone. All the best, buddy. It's honor to be someone's hero, and you were for that kid. Respect, man.
Rest in peace Braxton. Dally, in all your future endeavors, just know that any luck you receive has been bestowed upon you by this amazing young man! Love you buddy, hope you're doing alright!
❤❤❤
Rip Braxton you will be remembered
Praise God for this awesome kid! You gave him his dream. Please know that you will be blessed beyond measure for showing Braxton nothing but love. May he Rest In Peace🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾.  To Braxton: WE LOVE YOU ❤️❤️❤️

We may not be able to change the world but nevertheless we can still make a huge positive impact upon it. Extremely proud of what you do And who you are.  RIP Braxton : Let God embrace him with all his love and glory and may he forever rest in paradise .

As a parent of two boys with a rare disease and one about to Make-a-Wish I just want to say I appreciate you and what you did for Braxton.
RIP Braxton 🖤🖤
God rest his little soul, and God bless you, as well.
Rest in Peace Braxton.
Hi Jake. my name is Joel and I live in Brazil. I watch your videos and have fun with you and your adventurous friends. I noticed your sadness in your tears and I tell you to be at peace because you brought immense happiness to this angel when you were with him. its content reaches many people around the world and inspires as well. keep doing it from the heart. an idea for you, pay homage to the boy by sticking something on his wetsuit because everyone will see and remember him when you record his videos. God bless you
I was recently diagnosed with leukemia on my 29th birthday. I couldn't image what him and his family are going through. Getting told you have cancer is the scariest feeling I've ever felt. I wouldn't wish it on no one. I'll keep them in my prayers.
❤️
Thank you Jake…. Braxton was a strong soul on earth and now is an amazing soul in Heaven. 🥲
im glad that you are telling us the negative things in life too
Rest in Peace Braxton, fly higher then the sky and continue to "kick butt with two T's"
Rip little buddy ❤️

You made his only wish possible and you couldn’t have done it better, massive respect to you my dude. It’s always the angels that are taken from us, truly heartbreaking. RIP Braxton ❤️
DALLMYD bless your heart, God we ask you to take this child into your embrace show him the light of the loved ones he left behind let him know he is in the hearts and minds of so many and bless his family for the loss of this beautiful child that was full of life all the way up till the end We pray in your name amen. in Braxton's name we KICK BUTT WITH 2 T'S. 🙏❤

Rest In Peace little fella ❤️💪🏽
Rest In Peace buddy 🕊
Dude you are a legend keep going remember YOU ARE ALLOWED TO CRY rip braxton you probably make his last times in life fun for him okay dude :)
Tough stuff to digest....it's hard to understand why God takes innocent children. I hope there's a much greater plan than what we're capable of understanding. Rest easy little guy. Glad you were able to fulfill his wish. I'm sure that's something he held onto until his last day.
Definitely so cute watching his face light up every step he took there was yet ANOTHER phone😉 You made his day so bright & cheerful I have no doubt that is all he talked about since 💖 YOU are such an amazing HERO to look up to.... no wonder he chose the day to spend with you💕 My kiddo's want to meet you & you are a hero to kids everywhere!  Thank you for being the BEST 🤍💙🤍💙 RIP Adorable Braxton🤍💙🤍💙
You have a big heart. You’re a blessing to everyone you meet.
I’m so sorry that you feel so broken, Braxton was such a fighter. You did your best for him, you was all he wanted you was in effect his “hero”. Stay strong 💕
RIP Glad he got to meet u, keep up the great work
That's so sad, rest in peace, Braxton!
what happend to that idiots comment about it being hilarious? karma coming his way sooner than later i hope
Rip Braxton you are a warrior
You did what he wanted to do,you made him happy, made him not think of his own mortality.... that's a great think brother, it's ok to grieve the loss...just know you occupied a very special place in his heart. God Bless ya brother, RIP lil fella.
So sorry for your loss!  I am so glad he chose you! Just remember Braxton is healed and has a new body in Heaven! Amen! You are an amazing person, ❤️ all that you do for others!
daimn. My bus driver died today too. He was really cool person.
Just remember that were ever he is going he will remember you rest in peace braxton
God bless
Your a great man you had a inpact on that kid rip
You're good man Jake <3
Man you made him so happy. You were his idol. You should feel really good that he loved you so much and wanted to be so much like you. He picked a great person to look up to. You have a big heart I have have so much respect for you my guy. Stay strong man😪☺️
Thanks for not apologizing for being human, for being who you are. An idea, make a t-shirt "kicken butt with two tt's" and proceeds go to the family. 🙏 For you.
Rest In Peace Braxton rest easy buddy
This guy is so sweet❤
No one, especially children, deserves to go through this. It's so amazing that you got to be part of his life and bring him happiness. I know for a fact it's one of the most amazing feelings in the world, to make a child happy and for them to love spending time with you. I hope his family will be ok and I hope anyone else going through situations like this will be ok too. I hope I get to see the day doctors continue to advance in medicine and technology so more can be saved, but those we lost will always be remembered, for who they were and how strong they were. Stay safe, folks, and take great care of yourselves and those you love. Rest in Peace, Braxton.
This video is the most genuine I have ever seen on Youtube.  I appreciate so much this has no cuts, just raw emotion.  Such a precious soul lost, RIP Braxton 💙💚
Great job keep up the good work
God bless everyone involved in braxtons life, I hope you can find comfort and peace, just as he has ❤️

Rest easy little buddy Brax 😞💔
I kind of knew what to prepare for especially being a sensitive guy (wimp) but the moment they showed him talking his voice and face was just a uncanny match to my son my gut sank and it's too much... damn little dude rest easy.
I wished the best for him and almost everyone did to! I can’t believe this! He was such a great kid.. we miss him so much.. so much love here from to his family.. rest in peace♥️
God bless you for doing what you could, may he forever be a little treasure hunter 🙏🏻😭💔
I'm so so sorry
R.I.P
I just want to hug you and his Mom&Dad! I hope you you find him in your dreams & get to go on an adventure! Poor Mama, I hope she can find him in her dreams and wake up knowing in her soul he is safe & happy!  His Dad is going to find the best biggest brightest green crystal & he'll know it's "Kickin Butt w/2T's" Brandon!   Thank You for sharing a real video! I just saw your sad face & had to hear what was going on. What a beautiful experience for you. Children are for the adults to nurture, Good Job! 💖
its good to see him happy rest in peace
your such a good person everyone loves u rest in peace braxton
Rest in piece in heaven❤️
I must say I cried a bit while watching this and I feel very bad for you and his parents
For those that live too long, the friends of days gone by and scenes from their adventures live on in their memories.  As such I have no regrets in meeting you, friend. Should the day ever come that we are not together, you will continue to shine like gold in my memories- John Lee  Sorry for your loss dallmyd, also just remember God won’t forsake us in the time of need, Godbless you and your family and anyone reading this
For anyone wondering, the meaning of the saying "Kicking butt with 2 t's" is that with 1 T it is "I'm kicking, but.." whereas with 2 T's it is "I'm kicking butt!"
This is the saddest thing we have to go through in our lives. Now Braxton can seek treasures in heaven as an angel, like his role model. Rest in peace little man, my condolences to his family.
We are so sorry for your loss of Braxton he was a good kid and brave one at that we will keep him in our thoughts while he is dancing with friends in heaven 🙏🏻🥺😔rest in peace Braxton
Rest in peace Braxton
Rip, young man. 💔
Rest in Piece Fly high 🕊
Dude I didnt wanna cry this morning. Amazing story. Ive been a follower for year and theres a reason why you were Braxrons Hero,  you should make a shirt with Kicking butt with 2 T's on it
R.I.P
Sounds like he loved u like a big brother & tat's probably hw he felt!! In his eyes u were an absolute angel 2 him. Ur energy must've gave off on him!! Trust me when I say this he would've wanted 2 meet u 1 way or another!! To Braxton's family  & Jake please listen 2 this song by BTS "Let Go".  Here's the English translation. BTS - Let Go (English Translation) Lyrics  [Intro: Jung Kook, Jimin] Before we say goodbye, let go But I'm lost in the maze of my heart From stereo to mono That's how the path splits  [Verse 1: RM] If my fate is to disappear like this, then this is my last letter Penned words, written then erased Feelings for you, so many to let go Unpuzzle my lego At a level where it can't return to its original shape So be it don't cry, I'mma let you go and fly  [Verse 2: SUGA] Hectic days, keeping myself busy Distraction filled schedule But I won't forget Burned into the back of my mind like tattoo We can't return to those days If I could, I'd call your name No, but I'll accept your blame It really is time to say goodbye  [Pre-Chorus: V, Jin] Before we say goodbye, let go But I'm lost in the maze of my heart From stereo to mono That's how the path splits, it continues  [Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin] In order to release your hand right now I gotta let you know (Gotta let you know) That I need to let you go (Need to let you go) Hard to say goodbye, but I can't run  [Refrain: Jimin, Jung Kook, Jin, V] I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo) I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo) I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo) (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo)  [Verse 3: j-hope] What have you been up to lately? Who are you thinking of so far away? Life without you is really unbelievable But even so I still gotta go To the person I loved too much To the red thread that got too entangled in itself I couldn't reach you, so I'll walk a separate path For that reason, I'll say goodbye  [Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jung Kook] At first every day is like that Beyond the tears hidden in the rain I'll wait for you, let's start over So that in the future I can meet you again with a smile  [Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin] In order to release your hand right now I gotta let you know (Gotta let you know) That I need to let you go (Need to let you go) Hard to say goodbye, but I can' run  [Refrain: Jimin, Jung Kook, Jin, V] I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo) I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo) I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo) (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo)  [Bridge: Jin, V, Jung Kook & Jimin] The color of the sky we saw together The scent of the path we walked down together Don't forget them  [Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin] In order to release your hand right now (Ah) I gotta let you know (Gotta let you know) That I need to let you go (Need to let you go) Hard to say goodbye, but I can't run  [Refrain: Jimin, Jung Kook, Jin, V] I'm ready to let go, oh (Hoo, hoo, hoo) I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo) yeah I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo) I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo) I'm ready to let go
Much love to yourself and Braxtons family from UK :( can't imagine how you are all feeling right now! Rest in peace Braxton x

I know that the pain hits hard right now but I promise that they will transition into tears of joy when you look back on your time spent together. God bless you and Rest in Peace Braxton.
Kicking butt. 👍🏽
You made him so happy before he gone... rest in peace Braxton.
You have always been a man who wears his heart on his sleeve, but you gave him the thing he wanted most in the World. RIP brave one x
RIP
Rest In Peace Braxton
Rest In Peace braxton ❤️❤️
Crying my eyes out here😭...Knowing there is nothing anybody could say that would make this better I do hope this day you gave him brings them comfort. I wish all the best and all the love for them 💖
Rest in peace.
Your raw emotions probably mean so much to Braxton’s family. I’ve been in their position and my heart rebreaks for them, not that it has been whole in a while. Here is an idea…merchandise that says kicking butt with two ts and all proceeds to make a wish ??
Rip little one❤️
Fly high little dude
Sending love to Braxtons Family.

I’m sorry for your loss, such a cute little boy who wanted to have an adventure. I lost a close friend of mine who was like a 3rd older brother to me, he passed away from Brain Cancer.

I’m not usually an emotional person at all but this dropped a tear from my eye. RIP little buddy 🙏🏻
I’m paying outside of the us without a credit card. Is there a bank account number I can transfer money to?
I pray that it’s no time soon but, he will be waiting for you with the same smile on his face when you get to heaven. You’re amazing.
Rip little guy.. it pains me so much just to see how many horrible comments there are. That side note part made me cry sm. You made him happy and I’m sure the family is so happy you were there to see him and make him happy before he went

I lost a friend to cancer a couple months ago and it sucks man..She was so strong and she faught really hard for really long...It sucks that people who are so young have to live in pain and leave this world so young..Rip Braxton and Selena...I hate cancer man😔
@Mrbeast
R.I.P.
What a amazing thing you did and received!! God bless!!
R.I.P Braxton, you sound like you were an amazing person
It's like I'm reliving a specific type of heartache all over again. Our school had a little boy that went to our school named Braxton as well, and he passed I'm pretty sure the same way, and he is now out school's mascot. We're now called the Warriors. Both of these kids were fighters. This little boy fought tooth and nail just to be with you, Jake. That's so inspiring. I'm so sorry that this has happened, and I give all of my love and hope towards the family and you. I hope that one day I get to meet this heroic little guy in heaven. It'd be an honor meeting someone so strong and brave. From now on, I'm going to kick butt with two T's, because if I do I know I can face anything, just like this little boy did. Rest easy and well, Braxton. I hope you meet our Braxton up there as well. Two Warriors will meet each other and live their best lives in heaven together. Tomorrow I'm going to find everything that I can that has green on it. I don't have much, but I will do what it takes to find something with green on it. 💚💚💚
Rip I will send prayers to his family we love you ❤
Rest in Peace Braxton. 👊
dude is dead :(
Rest Easy buddy treasure hunt dive in heaven for us brother🙏🏾🌎

Rip
You are amazing! This is first time watching your vids it’s okay to cry hunny thank you for sharing his story! I can tell he really enjoyed himself with you! My son didn’t get a chance to fulfill his wish from make a wish. He wanted to go to Disney Land. It’s really sucks there’s not a day I don’t miss him.  Rest in Paradise Braxton you will be truly missed 🕊♥️ To the family may God bring you peace and healing during this difficult time I know it hard I’m still grieving and it been 3 years. I will continue to pray for y’all 😘
Awe I'm crying with you. You brought him joy, keep that in your heart. Take care!
Rip I’m so sorry for your loss
I was a Make a Wish child as well. I went through chemo for ALL (a type of Leukemia) in first grade. I can honestly say Make a Wish just... made everything better. It was a life changing experience. Seeing you go out of your way to make sure another child had his wish come true is beyond moving. I know this is a hard time, but I can safely say you made a GIGANTIC impact on Braxton's life. The world needs more people like you. I hope more people strive to do this, because it truly transforms a child's mindset. Thank you for doing what you do, and thank you to everyone who donates, supports and drives the fight against cancer for everyone. Rest in peace Braxton. I wish you were here with the rest of us. If you have stories from hardships like this, please share your stories. I'd love to hear them.
Hi
I hope you fully let it all out. I feel grateful that you were brave enough to post raw emotions and thought, man if only we had "hug-o-vision"  Sending so much love to you/your crew & his family & friends If he happened to draw something related to the connection he shared witg you - that would be a rad tat or even tshirt design with proceeds going to reputable childhood cancer research/treatment. ❤
What's this? I missed the news, please explain, this video appears on my homepage
My father passed away a few days ago on Feb-5th, I found your channel looking for positivity through these hard times. Thank you for the cool uploads RIP Braxton
Rest In Peace Braxton, may god give you a lot of hunts to do up in heaven little men…🤍🕊
Anyone passing away is sad but it definitely hits harder when its a child
RIP Braxton and condolences to the family
idk how I came to this vid, but wow... been in tears since I hit play.. rest in love to the boy...
i feel bad rip 😔
May re Rest In Peace
May Braxton rest in peace and fly high 😔🕊️
Love ya man pretty cool you made that kids dream come true and screw cancer takes to many people away way to soon Rest In Peace little guy
RIP  BRAXTON 🙏
So sad my friend I know what he was going through as I went through cancer  just remember the fun time you were able to share with him and make a big huge difference in his life what little he had you did your best brotha your a good man stay blessed ....
😭😭😢😢😢😭😭😭😢😢😭😢🥺
When
You truly made him so happy Jake. And he made a huge impact on everyone's life. Rest in peace Braxton. My prayers are with his family, friends and everyone who followed his story. Long live Braxton 💚🙏
I’m also a Make-A-Wish person and ik his experience with you meant the world to him. Thanks for doing that for him.
Rest In Peace Braxton, you are the embodiment of love and light. You will always be remembered for your innocent and adventurous heart ❤️
That’s unfortunate, but he’s in heaven now, lucky tbh because all children go to heaven and don’t have to worry about hell like most of us. Everyone who has reached the age of accountability of 13, that’s when your sin means you are headed for hell and the only way to escape the fate is to follow Jesus, repent of your sin which means no longer sin, and become born again through baptism in Jesus name from someone who has the Holy Spirit in them, not in titles from these heathen. Now think about your salvation, you could die tonight and you’re guilty with a sentence of hell on the line if you don’t obey. So get right with Jesus and that starts by reading and praying for wisdom. God bless you all and hopefully you follow Christ and in the days of heaven on earth, if we are in the kingdom, we can even connect to Braxton
got to the part where he got the text ab the burial omg i actually broke up and cried
You gave the greatest gift you can give. You gave of yourself, your time and your kindness. Those are the gifts money can’t buy. God Bless You.
Let it out Jake. He's always looking over you wishing you the best for everything. You made his life complete. You're amazing! We respect everything you do.  My dearest condolences 💐
I'm so sorry.. rest in peace and i hope his family is doing alright. god this is sad.
Much love to you for doing that for him... may God bless you and grant ease to you and the family as well. RIP young prince 💙😔
Rip buddy💙
Oh Jake I just want to give you a hug seeing you cry & hurt broke my heart!!! You are a amazing person Jake & you made that baby's day! Hats off to you for that you blessed that baby! I know it hurts Jake & no words ease the pain but that baby is your & his family's angel watching over! You have such a beautiful heart Jake & it shows! Proud of you! Hugs & prayers for you & his Family!
Man I  feel you, my friend was a make a wish kid and he passed, I cried for a week straight.
I’m a make-a-wish kid myself, and to see that you can see just how much this means to each kid is truly amazing. For a short amount of time that day, you made his greatest wish come true, and you brought him so much happiness. I’m tearing up as I’m typing this, because I can remember how I felt when I had my wish granted and what it meant to me. RIP Braxton, fly high buddy.
Rest in peace Braxton. I wish the best to him and he’s family 💙🥺💙
This made me tear up rip bud
You did a good job by fulfilling his dream . RIP Braxton
Rest In Peace Braxton wiedman
He's a  Real trooper ❤️
Rest easy Braxton. I’m praying for your family.
damn this crazy i’m happy he looked up to you as a hero, it’s a good reminder that anyone can be a role model to anyone.. even if it’s as simple as finding some treasure
RIP
You changed a persons life and made his life man. I think you did everything anyone could wish for man. Life sucks and we take it for granted sometime but small things like this is what keeps the world going man. Wish people would be a blessing and an inspiration like you are Jake.
Life can be so beautiful but evil at the same time. RIP Braxton, god rest your soul 😖😭
REST In Peace Braxton this made me tear up

RIP Braxton. I feel for you, man. Death is cruel; whoever decided to make us so hyper aware of both our own and others' mortality, while also making us care so much about those close to us is pretty sick in the head.
He’ll be in a better place atleast, once he wakes back up, above in the sky. He’ll remember those memories you brought him. Rest in piece braxton 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I’m so sorry :(
Rest up big man

Dear Heavenly Father we may never understand why you took such a young innocent soul so soon, but we know you needed Braxton with you and he got to accomplish his task you had for him here on earth! Pleas keep Jake and everyone and Braxton’s family from hurting help them threw these difficult times and help them find peace! Lord I ask you to look over Jake and Braxton’s family and give them comfort and let them know that everything is okay, lord I ask you to give them strength to keep moving forward and to know yes the family chain may have been temporarily broken, but all chains can be fixed and put back together over time! In Jesus name I pray amen! If you guys need anything anything at all please reach out
I cried with you through this whole video. Rest In Peace Braxton. I also donated to Make a Wish as well.
I haven’t watch jake for a little while, And I hate to see the first video I see it’s him upset about something. I feel like the algorithm pushes more negative content and positive. So sorry for your loss Jake.

So young.. He's with the Lord in heaven right now enjoying his brand new perfect body.  Rejoice for him. Mourn for the family. To be absent from the body, is to be present with the Lord. May his death make us realize we aren't guaranteed tomorrow.  Seek out Christ while you can.
Sorry for the lose ❤️

Man I am soo sorry my guy I lost my brother to cancer on October 16th at 7.35 am the day I lost my brother to cancer i was broken and destroyed seeing u and they kid going hunting in. The River it was like watching a father and a son together i bit u that kid  counted you as a father figure . Like my brother he was my best friend and a  inspiration on me cancer sucks and I wish there was a cure for it . But man I am soo sorry for ur loss
I am sorry
You made his day may he rest in peace
you did something for that kid, something that he will remember throughout his entire excitants, thats, THATS, what really broke my heart. ❤ You did something to make his last days the ones he would cherish the most. I am bawling my eyes out from the shear fact that Braxton wanted to be burred with the crystal you gave him. It just goes to show, how much he loved you, and how much what you did for him mattered. Do a good deed daily, and kick butt with 2 t's. Much love ❤
God bless
he was loved so much may his soul rest at peace
Rest In Peace Braxton 😢
I’m sure you will make even more kids happy! Rest In Peace Braxton🕊🕊

RIP little buddy, your in a better place now.
I'm dealing with a brain tumor taking my big sister slowly causing her to pretty much loose her mind. It's tough and it sucks really bad especially because we got her back from heroin for this to happen just when I thought we finally got her back.

For Braxtons Family  Odin has called another one home You will be missed, dear friend Release your pain and sickness Allow the valkyries to float your spirit high up as you ascend beyond these white clouds and blue sky Leave the physical world but your memory will not be left behind It will never die Walk through the gates of marble and gold Smiling with a smile, brave and bold;  Odin has called another one home To Braxton, Till Valhalla

This is So Sad Poor Braxton he didn’t deserve to go thru this he was brave and had his whole life ahead of him.😔 Long Live Braxton👼🏻🙏🏻
Hats off to you for making that young mans wish come true. You're a stand up guy and i bet he and his family truly appreciated what you did for him. Keep your head up brother.
Like I said before… you had a chance to be a hero and succeeded well. You blessed his life with your time and thoughtfulness. And he blessed yours…. He taught you even more about the value of the life we each have and to make the best of the time we get. But of course it is too short for some like Braxton. Your real tears honor his life and your character. Bless Braxton and bless you too for giving home a piece of your life that clearly made him very happy.
Rip Braxton
RIP.
Things like this are bitter-sweet. I love to see it but unfortunately, there are more struggling children than amazing influencers Just recently I lost one of the students in my school because of covid, even though they did not lose their life because of cancer, or anything like it, I still feel it was necessary to mention. Life is like a rollercoaster, it has its up and downs, but I know the Youtube community, especially the DALLMYD community can get through this together.  My condolences are sent to this family of Braxton Weidman <3.
Rest In Peace Braxton
Your a great person bro keep your head up you gave him the time of his life cherish that. 🙏🏻🙏🏻
I am so sorry this happened to you
My grandma died from the same thing man I feel the pain I’m sorry
Fly high little angles Braxton 🕊🤍

Rest in peace Braxton you will always be missed and you will always be loved I hope to meet you someday in heaven and maybe when I meet you in heaven we could be best friends and please save some treasure for me love you Braxton and I'm really sorry that you had to die at such a young age miss you Braxton 🙏🥺

Sorry 😞
Losing a loved one to cancer is the hardest thing anyone can deal with. Other than the patient fighting the terrible disease of course. Family members and friends are left wondering WHY! Why God did you take my mom, my son, my friend, my _________ ! It leaves you feeling so empty, so sad, so numb. God bless his little soul.
May he be with gid🙏🏻
Rest in peace Braxton 🇺🇸😭
I respect everything you did god bless you 🙏
This ones for you braxton 👑
❤️
rip in piece little guy rip

I remember watching the original video to this. You made him so happy even if it was just for one day. You made such an impact on his life in such a short amount of time. And for the family if they're seeing any of this, I'm sorry you had to go through this. I know he was a strong kid.
You asked why you? He knew you have a great heart! You showed him an awesome, normal day. He will always be in your heart! God puts people in our lives for a reason and Braxton needed you at that time. RIH Braxton! 💜💜💜🙏🙏🙏💜💜💜
rip braxton
I’m sorry Jake. You had such a huge impact and were a huge inspiration to him.

Stay strong Jake, live life honoring Braxton. Live life stronger, better, and as a fighter just like Braxton.

Keep doing what you're doing Jake, you have a great heart and are an inspiration.
RIP Braxton 🙏
The little guy chose you because your awesome, you don't realize this but millions of people look up to you. Plus, you are the nicest person in the world, for this precise reason.

I’m so sorry 😞😢
I’m so sorry for your loss. I’m not a subscriber, I just stumbled upon this video in my feed. As sad as it was, I’m glad I found it. Taking him out made his whole year. His memory will live on through you and that video.   #kickingbuttwith2t’s
Once you started crying tears started falling down my tears..... 😭
Always watched your videos, never subscribed. You got a subscriber now. " it's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice."  I hope you continue the grind and I hope to see more wishes granted! Everyone is a hero to someone.
You did good man. You did good. Respect man. Mad respect. RIP little man & Fly High!!!
Praying for you brother for your peace and well being
You’ve got to know how much respect I’ve got for you showing and sharing your emotions and you gave the kid the best and most beautiful thing ever.LOVE. R.I.P Braxton one day we will meet you again❤️❤️

Sorry for Braxton he was a legend I wish he had made it DALLMYD
Such a compassionate man you are! I wish everyone could show the love and compassion for fellow humans that you.
Rip little buddy
🥺 This hurts my heart. My cousin has leukemia and it scares me all the time .
🤭😨😭
I remember watching this guy grind for the Faze500, and now he's out here inspiring people so much that there are kids wishing to be with him just for a weekend. That should be a tell tale sign that he has really grown into such a great and inspirational person. Being willing to put your emotions out on the line with this video really gives a insight on the type of person you are and as we can see you are a amazing soul.
seeing Jake cry made me cry too bless you Jake
im so sorry for you
RIP BRAXTON
Rest in peace Braxton

R.I.P fly high
Keep your chin up. Braxton looked like he had a blast with you in the video. It’s so sad that he lost his battle. He is in heaven and is no longer suffering. Jake what you did speaks volumes about you. You gave a sick child a day not to worry about being sick. You gave him a chance to smile and be happy. RIP Braxton.
youtubers haven't yet realized the impact they are having on kids today. Youtube is their tv YOU are their moviestars and super hero's and that is a huge responsibility. I know you didn't ask for that responsibility but its yours. Thank you for doing it so well! what a humbling experience to be a childs make a wish...such an honor. I'm happy to see you both touched each others lives in such a positive way. God Bless! KICK'N BUTT WITH 2 T'S!!!
rest in peace little man. To you man and to all of the Weidman family please accept my deepest condolences. Much love and support to you all <3

Rip Braxton
You're a saint brother! Just goes to show you even tho you're unaware of it, there's always, ALWAYS someone that looks up to you. No matter who you are there's someone looking at you as an example. What a great hero this young man found in you sir! If it's okay I would like to adopt that kickin' butt with two t's saying. I love it cuz you could be kickin but, which is like saying I'm alive but... Or you can say kickin' butt with two t's which in Braxton's case that's how he chose to live, not just by being alive but by kickin' butt everyday 💪💪 wise beyond is years 🙏 rest easy Braxton 😇
Fly high buddy hope there’s lots of treasures for you to find wherever you’re at.
Prayers for you brother. You have a genuine heart and the Lord will bless your continued work. Prayers for the family...
R.I.P I hope he had a great life 🕊
Rest In Peace for Braxton Pray for him 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 :(
U made his day but he touched ur life and heart... condolences to his family.

Send all the love in the world to the Weidman family. You were kicking butt here, Braxton- and I'm sure you're kicking butt up in the sky, too.
🥺❤
Rest in peace little guy 😥
I think he was refering the word *butt* because *Butt* has literally two tees.
:(((((((((((
Love this! ❤️ sending love to you and his family. RIP Braxton
R.I.P Braxton❤️🕊
rest in peace braxton🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️❤️
We love you braxton.  REST IN PEACE 🕊
Jake, I'm sorry the family's loss and yours too.
May he be happy above us forever you did good jake 😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️
I love that you took the opportunity to impact that sweet boys life. But no one ever expects these kids to impact your life more than anything else. You will always have a special place in your heart for that sweet boy.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️
❤️🥺🥺🥺
I feel always sorry to her these story’s. You did a wonderful job, spending fun days with him. We will be by his side even though he’s gone. 💔
Rest in peace Praxton😞#Kickingbuttwith2t's
Praying For his family and also for you. RIP Little Man
Rip Braxton
I enjoyed watching Braxtons video so much. I love how much effort you put into him having such an amazing day.. Not all heros wear capes. Braxton will forever be in my memory. Sending my love to his entire family.❤️
It's hard now. But to think that he prolly didnt even think about being sick for that whole day. Prolly for days after really. That is so much more then people will ever understand. Hard to understand that it's not how u look at urself. But how others think of u. You may not feel like the hero he knew u are. None of them will forget that Jake. I hope this doesnt deter u from future wishes. Because it doesn't get easier. Please keep up the good work. Having 3 kids made this hard to even watch till the end. No kids should ever have to deal with any part of cancer. The parents should never have to never deal with the things they go thru because of cancer. I'm from toledo. The founder of st judes Danny Thomas was born in Mich but raised in toledo. Almost makes me proud he was from here. I pray that they get it figured out sooner then later. Please if u are able donate to st judes.
RIP braxton
Rest in Peace 🙁😭
Rest in Paradise Braxton.
Sending you hugs, DALLMYD.
RIP🙏🏾BRAXTON
Rest In Peace Braxton ✝️

Rest in Peace :( so sad man
Rip 🙏 hope he is better up there 🙏
rip
Dall I feel everything that you said in that video and I have to say I wish the best for you and the Weidman Family. I am 16 and I kind of know what it feels like to go thru all the emotions flowing through as time moves on. I have had a colostomy bag since birth. Been thru 3 major and 27 minor at least that is what I was told. But the one that has impacted me the most was when I had to get a soft ball sized tumor removed when I was an infant. But, what happened to Braxton is worse than that. I am sorry for the Weidman families loss. But I am in foster care right now due to an abusive family and I just wanted to say I wish for the best of your Channel and the Weidman Family. If you read this. My name is Daniel Hunter, Thanks for reading
Rest in Peace :(
Bro thats so sad☹︎
Rest In Peace Braxton 🙏, you were an example to us all
Rest in peace little buddy. I'm so glad you got to have your wish fulfilled.
This was a heartbreakingly beautiful tribute ❤ Keep kicking butt with two Ts Braxton's family!
May he Rest In Peace❤️🕊
I love you man you're doing great things
may he rest in peace he is in a better place now
R.i.p
That's too bad.  It was really nice of you to do that for him.  It's like a faith in humanity restored thing.  Thanks for that.
Jake and Braxton's family you did the best that you could and that's what matters the most. he was a great kid and Braxton rest in peace and keep on kicking butt with two T's

First things first. Braxton and his family. May you always remember his soul. To you Jake you gave him everything he wanted. He left this earth fulfilled.  You share yourself with us all the time. For that moment his role model was just there for him. Wish granted. The lesson here is to make sure you live life to the fullest doing what grants you joy. May you heal, and remember his soul. Kicking butt with two T's.

Personally I believe that kids like Braxton and others with illnesses like this are too pure for our world. They are always fighters with kind hearts and positive outlooks on life, and they help show us the best we can be despite our circumstances. RIP Braxton, Jakes little treasure hunter 🏴‍☠️👑🤿

Didn't know my respect for you could exceed 100%, but it just did. You are AWESOME! As a diver myself, I recognise the passion and sparkle in the eyes of Braxton when he was with you. Take care. Take a well-deserved break if you need it. I don't have the words to say how big of a role model you are to me and probably soooo many people all around the world.
rest in peace
Prayers for the family and you jake! The fact he was buried with a piece of treasure you found is so special!! RIP sweet Braxton! 💚💚

I can't imagine how humbling and honoring it must feel to be a kids only wish.
We love you Braxton Rip✊🏻🙏🏻
Hi jake! I’ve been following your videos for a long time, what you’ve done for Braxton was amazing. Your selfless heart and positivity on life has put such a big impact on me, I was so touched by your compassion towards Braxton. I am definitely inspired to live life kicking butt with 2 TT’s this has definitely reminded me not to take life for granted… Keep sending those positive vibes the world needs it!!!!! 1 Thessalonians 5:20 Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing. Me my wife and my family are praying that God will be with you and comfort you Jake and for Braxton and his family! strength, peace, joy and happiness in life! God bless bro!🙏🏼
God bless you!

Dang it man, I'm in class right now getting distracted. I don't need to cry. 😭  You're amazing. Don't you forget it!
man, life aint fair. rip braxton
Shoutout to Jake, obviously I don’t know you personally but the stuff you do on a consistent basis, helping police, returning lost items, and spending time with fans, I don’t even think you realize how much of a positive impact you have on the world through you’re YouTube channel. Keep it up man, one day you’ll look back and realize all the good stuff you’ve done for everyone. ❤️
Omg. This video has me in tears brother!  You’re a great guy to make this kids day!
Rest In Peace Braxton❤️
U amazing
Braxton sounds like one amazing little kid!!! His impact on your life is just as much of a gift as spending time with you was a gift to him.  When you make a soul connection with someone, I believe that never ends.  May you always carry and honor Braxton’s kindred spirit of love, adventure & discovery with you.  Every now and again, as it comes out to play, let it shine in all of it’s glory as your grief is given wings to fly.  What a blessing to share such time together!!!  This must be what it feels like to be someone’s hero. 💗
Rest in peace Braxton
❤
RIp Braxton 🙏😭

You made his dream happen, made a child happy, you did make an impact on his life, that is something that most of us should do for any child in such a situation, even if it is small, thank you so much for showing us this, very emotional and a good example for all of us to make it happen for a child with cancer R.I.P Braxton

Rest in peace buddy
rest in peace man this is so sad
🙏🙏❤
I only realised years after having had cancer as a teen that make a wish was a thing. While I didn’t personally profit from it after I got to know the foundation I made sure to encourage friends of mine that were still in or just out of treatment to make a wish and I can tell you, those experiences were definite highlights for all the kids!  Thank you for granting Braxton his wish, I’m sure that’s as a memory he cherished a lot. Rest in peace buddy
😭😭😭 RIP
Big up Braxton
RIP braxton.   My deepest condolences to the family 😓
You´ll be remembered Braxton!! RIP

To the Weidman’s, I am so sorry for all you’ve been through and all you will continue to face. You raised a bright, witty, joyous young man who has touched the lives of so many of us here. We feel his loss and will hold him in our hearts. ❤️❤️❤️
Hmm… how about u go to his house when u go mining for treasures, how about u place it in his room for memories with him and u being together. R.I.P Braxton. Btw I also lost my aunt in October 1 2021 she was being a fighter for the battle of cancer but she lost against the cancer. Cancer has won.
Thank you for doing this update, I could feel your trauma in doing it, this makes you a man amongst men, for giving a very sick little boy time to live his dream, & you were it, so do not belittle what you do, just acknowledge you made things better for a stranger for a bit, bless you, Braxton & your team. I only just noticed how closely Braxton's last name & mine are similar, mine is spelled Wieden, cheers.
You honour his memory and his family by making this. You know he’s up there with that big, beautiful smile having the time of his life with a spectacular crystal collection and no more pain. You helped him make his biggest wish come true.  That’s pretty special for anyone, especially a young, bright boy like Braxton. Let’s kick life with two t’s. ❤️❤️❤️
May he Rest In Peace you made him so happy that day and he loved every moment so where every he is in his next life or in heaven we will all miss him and remember him as a fighter
Rest In Peace little buddy ! 😢
We love you braxtion rest easy buddy 💙 n sending love to braxtion family n im so sorry just know ill never for get braxtion thank to Jake I loved watching his video with your beautiful little boy 😘😘 all the way from Australia lots of love ❤

My condolences to the family 🙏🙏🕊️🕊️🕊️
You gave this kid a great send off as bad as that sounds but it's true. I know this video wasn't easy for you to make and you could tell right off the bat that you tried a few times previous to try and get through with what you wanted to say. Look at it this way the kid no longer has to suffer and be in such a crappy world that we're having and is better off where he is now. Where ever that may be.
Rest In Peace little champ your much loved
Rip ❤️
This hurts u can really show how close and how much Jake cares about this little boy they spent a little time together and formed the best bond in such little time
No one should ever die at a young age. May you Rest In Peace, Little Braxton.
Rest in peace Braxton! My condolences are with his family! This is such a sad ending to the life of such a young kid. You've made his life so much better by just doing what you're doing
Rest in peace Braxton🙏🏽😢 amazing that you got to make such an impact on his life! This video made me cry.
braxton was a g... rip. you r amazing!
Rest In Peace Braxton ♥️
We love you Jake and braxton will always live in your heart and we are here to support you through this horrible time. Braxton is in a better place now. Rest In Peace ❤️
Rest in peace Paxton you really affected his life in a good way 💔🙏🙏
Dang Jake you made a kids day then to hear that he's gone I know how u feel man I lost 2 of my family members while I was in the hospital and I couldn't go to their funeral
R.I.P
This made me want to start crying tbh may him Rest In Peace
Rest In Pest Braxton 🙏🏻
Just know how happy you made him Rip little man 💙
Much love from Australia
May God bless you for the positive role you  played in his life, and may he rest in peace.
This is an example of when game doesn’t change a person he still has a heart of gold and braxton is going to be watching over you man
sad.
Rest In Peace, Paradise, and Power, Braxton. You didn't deserve to leave this world so early, but you made your 9 years here the best 9 years the world could see.
I'm so sorry you had to go through that. I've been through something recently, I lost my dad to cancer and it was hard. Me and him were so close and the last 2 weeks were hard. And he passed as soon as I gave him his pain medicine and I thought I did something but they kept telling me I didn't but thought I did it. But both of them and all of the people who died from cancer are no longer suffering and are in a better place, and God will take good care of all of them.
Respect for you crying on video that takes a real man to show emotions like that and still post it for millions
Rest In Peace Braxton.  Thank you for being a great person Jake.  You and Braxton’s family have an angel lookin down on ya.  🙏 🙏 🙏
You are a good man 🥺🥺🥺🥺🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️ Rest In Peace Braxton
Rest in peace Braxton 🙏

I want to comment on a comment in here. I believe you should make a “kickin butt with 2 T’s.” Merchandise fundraiser. All money made from the merchandise would be directly donated to the make a wish foundation to help fund dreams like his. I’ve heard some heart breaking tales. But this one hits pretty hard. May he Rest In Peace and thank you for making his dream come true.
Braxton, rest in peace, little pal! 😢
I'm so deeply sorry. RIP sweet angel.
Oh my heart 💔🥺

Sorry for your loss 😢😢😢
Rip Braxton  i love you 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😢😢😢
This is the first video of yours I have ever seen. And to be honest, you showed your humanity at 10x the level of so many other well know people and celebrities who have the means and resources to do great things like this for people but don’t. You definitely made a difference in this young man’s life. Good job man. Life has painful moments. I fully understand your feelings here. I have been in the same type of place. Keep doing great things. 👍💯💯💯💯
R.I.P
You’re a good man Jake. Seeing you at the funeral and reception was one of the most heartwarming parts of that day.

To Jake, you were no small part of Braxton's life you were the spark of happiness at the end of a dark tunnel, you gave him joy in his hardest time and while its unfair he was taken away so soon he will always be with you on all your adventures smiling because you cared to know him. Out 12 million people you choose to spend time with him and that's what matters. Rest in peace Braxton you will never be forgotten
Love yall I cried and i will kick butt with two t’s its sad but he is in a better place now and he will not hurt any more fly high braxton we love you 💔❤️

Hey at least he's in a better place and he's not suffering anymore and he's probably happy where he is and he don't want you to cry so please try and stay happy just for him I know it said I lost two dogs and less than a month but they wouldn't want me to be sad and neither would he so I try and be happy for them so you should try and be happy for him I know it's hard but you'll get through it

Rest In Peace Braxton
To the Weidman family. I don't even know if you will read this and I know I am just some stranger on the internet who has no personal connection to you but I can tell your son was a good kid, I remember seeing Jakes first video and just smiling you could just tell he was the kid who just lit up the room when he entered and its not fair he was taken from you so soon.  I can not imagine what it feels like going through this,  and even though I can't compare any loss I've had to the one your dealing with now remember he's in a better place, with no pain, watching down on you smiling.  Rest in Peace Braxton your story touched the hearts of so many.
RIP Buddy!
All love goes to you and this little boy I hope the best for you and his family!💙💙💙💙💙💙
Rip
My heart and prayers go out to Braxton😭❤
RIP BRAXTON WE WILL MISS YOU
Rip
Fly high Braxton! 🙌🏼💜
Dued I didn't meet this kid but I'm crying with you man.
that was so difficult getting through that video. Two years ago in January, my mom died of cancer 9 months after being diagnosed, it was stage 4. I was in shock for the first full year, I didn't cry, I couldn't cry. I am just thankful that I was able to take care of her during that time, as hard as it was, I am eternally grateful that I was there for her the whole time. This video had me crying, what a sweet boy. Tonight in my evening prayer I will pray for him and his family.
Rest In Peace fly high lil man
God bless you for giving Braxton his wish. I'm so sorry for the loss of such a beautiful young man 🙏🏼💕
Plz stop I hope you are joking I really am crying (Rest in peace Braxton) he's just kid plz pray for him TYSM dallmyd for making him so happy before he was so young I wish it was me and not him he is so young I just cant

Rip Braxton 🙏 you were the best treasure hunter to ever touch the water we all love and miss you Buddy ❤️
RIP Braxton
Lil boy dead and he my age too I can’t imagine losing someone my age that I know 😭 😭 😭 :(
Rest In Peace, Braxton. Jake, You weren’t a small part of his life. This was huge for him. You made him so happy with what you did and by visiting him and giving that crystal must’ve meant the world to him. Braxton fought and fought hard. ❤️❤️
My prayers go out to everyone affected by Braxtons passing. He was clearly an amazing kid but for some reason God had a much bigger plan for him.  Jake your videos are absolutely amazing and all your hard work shows. Thanks so much for your dedication to your channel. IMO you are by far one of the best entertainers out there, God bless you!
I pray for your and the family's peace of minds and hearts.
Sad that any child has to go through that rip buddy
RIP Braxton young kid and its a sad thing to hear but just know that we will be praying for his family and I know everyone watching this video is sad and touched by this story but he will be remembered and loved by many people RIP little Braxton
I know how this feels buddy. I haven’t lost my daughter but she is battling with a rare brain tumor. Everyday is hard. I feel like i cant breath.  I hate and don’t understand why children have to go through this. Every time were at OHSU i cant help but cry. Seeing sick kids and having one of my own is the hardest thing ive ever done.
Sorry for your loss. Rest In Peace Braxton.
That’s so sad you almost made me cry I liked that kid.
Rip 🕊 fly high 🙏🏻
My heart goes out to you Jake and to Braxton’s family, seems the little guy left a treasure worth more than anything in your life. Rest In Peace Braxton

What a blessing you are for Braxton and his family! Your crowns await you in heaven!  God Bless the family during this difficult time of saying, " I will see you later".   And may the Lord be with you in your endeavors. Remember, You don't have to be an athlete, rock star, or actor to be admired. Continue to be yourself, kind, and humble. That is what Braxton probably admired the most!
best wishes to you guys - Braxton famliy  stay strong
My heart hurts for you Jake, and for Braxtons  family and friends. It’s obvious your heart was with this little man. While you head comforting words for the family, you need to know YOU did all you could too.   He’s treasure hunting in Heaven, no doubt!

I can’t imagine what it’s like to deal with something like that but people like you show us what positivity, courage, determination and an amazing attitude under terrible circumstances is. You may have lost your battle but you’ve won the hearts and minds of the masses with all of your amazing character traits! And for that you will live on for eternity. Rest easy little warrior!! You are and always will be an inspiration to everyone! My condolences to your family and friends. Watch over them now and remain the light in their lives!!!! 🙏🏻💪🏻👊🏻💚😇

What happened to the boy
A small action given can mean the galaxy to the receiving person even if they do die due to cancer because cancer or any deadly diseases don't care about your age race or background or even wealth it is sad yes it is but at least you gave that child comfort when he needed it the most and maybe that's why he fought even more which honestly kudos to him for being a fighter it will not be easy but just know that you are making a difference in these children's lives because even though they may die and it is hard to deal with grief and I won't know exactly what you are going through but I have lost about 9 or 10 people that were close to me one being my fire chief now I experienced all of this death but yet it has not gotten easier because it doesn't get easier you just have to learn how to cope with it well not me I haven't learned how to cope with it yet but you my friend have changed a lot of us by your content and even Braxton's life even though I may been short but you still made a difference and that is what counts so keep what you're doing because it is what some people don't even think about doing 💙💙💙💙💙💙
Jake this was heartbreaking, because you always have fun finding things and you gave Braxton the same joy in treasure hunting, you gave the same joy you get with the big find. So sorry he was lost so young, but you help make his dreams come true, so sorry for Braxton's family and you, but you gave him the biggest joy in his way to short life💚💚💚💚💚,much love to his family and friends
godspeed jake
dally has done some cringe vids but i respect him for this you can really tell he cares bc ive been through similar and its how everybody tells a story about somebody who passed that they cared about

Don’t ever be embarrassed for crying brother. I could flood the Atlantic with the amount of tears I shed over kids dying from cancer.  It sucks.  Virtual embracing you brother.  You’re awesome for what you do.
This is the saddest video I have ever Sean. Can we get an rip in the comments.
Thank you!  I love your heart!  You made his life great!
Rest easy .💝💝
Jake is one of the greatest, most humble human beings on YouTube. Ef that…on the planet. I didn’t see the video with Braxton, but I know you made his life better. Keep doing what you’re doing, Jake…impacting lives in a positive way. Can’t say enough good things.
May his good soul rest in peace
Damn man I saw the thumbnail and new something was up
Rest In Peace 😭
The emotion you showed in this video really meant a lot to me, cause you only knew Braxton for such a short time yet he means so much to you Bro… not only to my prayers go out to his family but also to you to help alleviate both your feelings… I’m so sorry for his families loss but also for you cause I can tell how much he meant to you… your a great man brother God Bless you and his Family, he is with the father now
You sir….are a great influencer. God Bless Braxton and his family, and God Bless you Jake.
No parent should ever have to bury their little boy💔
it’s okay jake :/, this definitely hit the heart, stay up king, keep doing what you’re doing for braxton
pray for him
❤️RIP Braxton. Hugs to you Jake
It's the definition of unfair man.. beautiful people don't deserve disgusting things like cancer
I have watched most of your videos, I have to say Braxton's video was by far the best one. Jake, I want to say you did an amazing thing that day for Braxton, and I am sorry for his loss as Braxton seemed to be a kewl kid :) R.IP Braxton.
Hello my name is Matheus I'm from Brazil I always watch your videos I'm sorry for him never forget who he was in your heart my financial conditions are not good but if I can help with anything I could send a flower or a green teddy bear that he likes for you to put it wherever he is but he is sad not because he will always be in your heart and he is with God at this moment admiring your feeling for him may God comfort your heart of family and friends if what I wrote comes out something strange is that I used Google translator because I don't know how to write in English
rest in peace
such a awesome thing you did for him. Rest in peace bud.
i am sorry to hear that. R.I.P
Rip Braxton
Braxton is in a better place and he is looking for treasure up there

You will
Deadline
Your donation
Rip braxton we will always remember you
Rip Braxton, your up there hunting for treasure.
Go bye
It’s so goddamn unfair when kids die so extremely young. Nothing is more humbling than being someone’s inspiration, but it hits so much harder when that someone is a child.
Rest in Peace Braxton
I apologize get together
Man as a new dad this hits hard. I feel so bad for his parents. As a parent your one job is to protect your child and you can’t protect them from that. Glad you gave little man the best day. RIP little one
RIP Braxton!
I have a brother brother and you.
God bless him. Prayers for the family and you.
Rest in Peace Braxton ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jake you gave this little boy, his family and friends the best thing ever! Memories! Wonderful memories! And he gave you the best gift ever in return. Memories of the day you spent with him. Love ❤️ you man!
Mate. The fact that Braxton impacted you so greatly and how you made his day so awesome shows what a quality person you are. These things are very tough and I now believe wonderful people like Braxton are sent to teach us all something and give us something. I think he achieved his mission. He was lucky to have his wish granted with you but I suspect you are the lucky one. Chin up buddy you did good.
RIP Braxton
We all will miss Braxston😞
Rip braxton
You are such a good human man. RIP little treasure hunter!

Breaks my heart. 3 of my older brothers passed away at 27, 28 and 33. They fought till the end. The years were brutally hard, but I am happy I was able to help them until the end. Diseases really suck and the people that battle them are true gladiators.   RIP

Rest in peace Braxton ❤️
Let’s go run up the views on the other video as well
Your very real jake and everybody sees this! Rest in peace little Braxton! Much Love the UK.
As hard as that Kid fought, he was made up of happiness getting to hang out with you. Life is cruel taking him at such a young age. Cancer is an awful thing.  You are an incredible guy ensuring you gave that kid his wish of being able to meet you, and hang out with you. Guaranteed that meant ALOT to him. Thank you for giving him his wish and doing more than that, basically becoming his friend, visiting him. May he rest in peace 🕯
RIP I’m going to be praying for him his family and you
I am so sorry  hopefully  his family is  well
You are a good man Jake
Hope your finding all the treasures you heart can hold. RIP Braxton

I hope god is with you and rest in peace love that boy he cool lost a brother
Sorry for your loss.
You made him forget everything that was wrong with his world and the impact you made on him must have meant so much.

I am so sorry. I was randomly watching your videos the other day and one of them was Braxton's video. I am not good at saying but it was not a length of year we live, it is how meaningful and full of warm fun human and nature encounters we get and we can see Braxton had a great time with you. thanks for your channel. I will watch more of your videos.
I participated in a Make A Wish when I was a member of the 501st Legion....  It was amazing. It was sad....it was happy...it was so many emotions all at once...it's so hard to explain the feeling when you see that child smile.  All I can say is thank GOODNESS I wore a helmet and no one could see me....
R.I.P Braxton 🕊

Type in his name and it will show a video of his Funeral
I'm so sorry for your loss. Sending love <3
It's gonna get hard and we will be there for you and his family to get through life.
To see the love you have for the little man is so sweet. Losing anyone is difficult, but losing a child is absolutely devastating. No words could ever take the pain and loss one feels. However, knowing that with each passing day, we are one day closer to an eternal reunion, may help bring a little peace. Little man is rejoicing in Heaven & there is nothing better than eternity with God. May Our Lord comfort the whole family during such a difficult time. This video had me crying as soon as the first tear was shed. Thank you for sharing this story with the world.
😟😟😟
I am sorry 😔 to hear that he passed away and love you bro Grant his wish to be the best YouTuber

To Widemans, I am very sorry for your loss
Oh dear this is so heartbreaking. Sending prayers 🙏❤️
This is very sad
Rest In peace braxton
Thinking about you and the family. Rest in paradise little man 🙏❤
Thank you for giving him that. Proof you touch a lot of peoples lives.
Jake just remember brother he's in a better place now he doesn't have to deal with this world the way it is. I lost my cousin last year to bone cancer. I'm seriously crying right now watching your video and trying to type this. To the Weidman family may Braxton always be with you in your heart and in your mind and just remember he will always be watching over you.❤❤❤
Don't give in man he was the best 👼😔
That was so heartwarming
Rest in peace lil man 🖤🖤
Rip braxton
😭😭😭😭😭😭 RIP the best little ma ever 👼👼
so sorry to hear! R.I.P. little dude. And to Jake, keep being awesome and keep doing what you do best. Kicking butt with 2 "T's" ma dude.
Well that was rough to watch - you are a good man …
r.i.p braxton
God bless your soul Jake, you made his wish come true, he’s looking down from heaven smiling at you and thinking how grateful he was to meet you. RIP kiddo 🙏🏽💔
RIP little man 👼
Love to the family and everyone involved,  rip buddy ❤️
Rest in peace little man. Gone too soon. Prayers go out to the family. Words can't express that form of sadness. May God bless the rest of your life with Braxton by his side. 🙏
R.I.L little man, I hope everything for the best to the family and his loved ones may you heal for him and have a brighter future ahead of you for him!
RIP BRAXTON! sending my condolences to the Weidman family.
Rip Braxton hope you'll find all the treasure you've ever dreamed of and watch over Jake on all the dives and treasure hunts he goes on you will be missed. Thoughts to the family and to you Jake.
Rip little guy
May he fly with the angels 😇 R.I.P. Little dude So sorry for the loss😔
🕊
Tell them sorry bout yor laost
It's really not surprising that his wish was to spend a day treasure hunting with you, Jake.  You're an amazing person who's bettering the world by cleaning up the waterways of trash, helping the environment by doing your best for the creatures, returning what you can to those who lost the things, and by inspiring others to do the same through watching your videos. What you do is so admirable. That's why Braxton wanted to spend the day with you; because he wanted to be just like you and do his part for the planet and, at the same time, have fun doing it.  None of us ever know how much time we have left to make a difference in this world, so always treasure the memories more than the treasures you find.
What a sad story man. Cancer is something else to go through. I'm glad you got to make his wish  and make his life just a little bit better.  Condolences to the parents no one should ever have to go through with that especially kids. To the parents of Braxton , stay strong  RIP Braxton.
Rip lil man 💔🕊
RIP sweet boy🙏💙
RIP lil man. 🥺

God bless this kid and his family
Rip
Sorry to hear he has passed away. He is with the lord now and we should all take comfort in that. Jake brother I'm really encouraged by you and just being a genuine guy and hanging out with this little man. It's very obvious you cared alot for him. I'll be praying for his family and for you too that God comforts your hearts in that he isn't gone forever he is just somewhere else for the time being. Death was just the first step to an eternity for our little buddy. God bless and be comforted in Jesus name.
❤️❤️

I can't imagine going through this as a parent, more than earth shattering I imagine.
Rest in Peace Braxton WE LOVE YOU!!!!

To think that he couldve done anything or went anywhere and he chose to spend time a day with you shows your impact on young children.
Rest In Peace
You are such an amazing guy!!!! You are by far my favorite YouTuber!!!!
Rest in power little Braxton!
You would be very proud of your yourself bro for making that one amazing adventure for Braxton 🙏🏻 was not a make a wish it was make a new family member video that you will forever hold in your heart Rest In Peace and blessings and love to his family
It’s harder than people think(!)… you live your life, doing what you do thinking like you’re just this  “average guy” but turns out…  you’re somebody’s hero!  I’m not surprised by it & I hope you never get used to it because I think it’s gonna be happening a lot in your lifetime! LoL! if only because still you are nothing if not humble & kind. Today of all others, I can’t help but to think… if only there were MORE (I feel I need to say how needing there to be “MORE…” seems to be a running theme the fates have chosen for me to have to deal with myself today but…). YES, you are a hero! Not only because you did a wonderful thing for a wonderful little boy but because you thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it & created a friendship with a little boy. A friendship that one little boy, who was robbed by a medicinal form of evil of a life that was full of possibilities, who followed everything you did as if he was reading a blueprint for life (one that given the chance would’ve been very similar, lol!). 👊🏼💥👋🏼❗️ Please know I cannot say “I’m sorry” enough to really matter & that my thoughts + prayers are offered up for you & of course his family but, it is exactly at times like this when I find myself wondering… why can’t there be MORE?!? (more people like you, more kids like him, more research into the killing diseases, more time to give, just plain MORE!? Maybe if there was, the world today would be a much better place, just sayin… 🤷🏻‍♀️ thanks for sharing what must be tough to be doing! TTFN ✌🏼🤟🏼🧼🖖🏼

Rest in peace buddy and kick some butt with two t's up there! You better! ❤❤
My father-in-law had a glioblastoma mulitform, the most aggressive type of cancer that begins with the brain. He was feeling really down in the dumps one day when he was getting fitted for a special radiation helmet, until he looked over and there on the shelf were a bunch of little tiny ones. They were for children! It was that day when he basically just told the doctors to learn from him. Use him to get closer to a cure. He was initially told he had a few months. He lasted 3 more years, entering a few studies along the way. The doctors didn't know how he was doing it, but we like to think that today some kids might live a little longer now. This is one of the many reasons I don't believe in the concept of a God. What kind of sick all powerful being would give children cancer? Science is the way to a cure. It's the only way we'll get there.
Im crying rn, may he Rest In Peace❤️
For the life that you lived, it was a rough one full of up's and downs. With Jake granting your final wish we all are not only grateful for what he did but also for the impact your life left upon the world. You'll truly be missed and we will always remember you. RIP buddy ❤

Young man I watch you often but to see a MAN express TRUE emotions is what I believe our world needs. To see you emotionally touched and express it openly tells me you are truly a good and blessed human being. God bless you in all your craziness and continue to bless others beyond yourself.
It sucks when kids can't be kids because of cancer. Just feel at peace believing that there is more than just this life. God Bless him.
God bless you kid X

First, my most sincere condolences to The Weidman Family. And to you Jake, and those who knew Braxton, and came to know Braxton. May Braxton be whole, pain free and happy in Heaven. Thank you Jake, for letting us all know of Braxton's passing. I've prayed for our Lord to wrap His loving arms around ALL that knew Braxton (and of Braxton) and love Braxton, to comfort them in their time (s) of need and sorrow. Much love to each and every one of you. God Bless.
you are so amazing to give this little guy a dream come true.
Man this is heavy 😞
We love you Braxton 🤍

Rip lil bro… he lives on in all of us now thanks to u brother.. thank u for sharing
Rest In Peace ☮️ Braxton
from watching the first video, you could immediately see that braxton was a happy kid. dealing with cancer and being put through cancer, especially as a kid, is really hard on not only the kid, but the family and friends. he will never forget what you did for him and how much he was loved. i truly wish the family is doing okay, i've never really lost an immediate family member, but i couldn't imagine how much pain it would bring. braxton fought until he couldn't fight anymore. he is a true warrior. he spent his last few days with the people he loves most with him. some things we can't control no matter how much we wish we could. braxton was a truly inspiring kid. rest in peace ☁️💓✊🏼
So tough! 🙏🏻🙏🏻 You’re a good man
He was a beautiful child. Thank you for all you do.
Hats off to you my friend..you are truly an inspiration. Rest up kiddo..🙏prayers to the family
Are u going to he’s funeral
Love... It's all about love and love is all you need. If only everyone was this loving.
What a beautiful little guy, may he rest in peace. Blessings to his family, stay strong💗🙏🏼
Rest in paradise buddy 💙🙏🏽
Kickin butt with two “T”s
My heart goes out to this family and you I was in tears watching this video. I'm so glad his wish came true  to meet you not a lot of kids get that.❤
Rip Braxton! Forever be remembered never be forgotten.
So sad 😞 Rest In Peace Braxton 🙏🏾♥️

I’m sorry for this all happening it made me sad hearing about it and I can’t even imagine all the emotions you and the family are feeling❤️you made an impact on his life and you were his role model and his dream was to meet you and you made that come true just remember that you made his last moments some of the best he’s had❤️
Looking like Trisha
Kickin Butt with two t’s! Rest In Peace Braxton❤️
Don’t cry. He’s always with you know this♥️
These are tears from a man. Tears from a man who TRULY loves his son. Man i know the pain i can hear it in your voice. Be happy that he lived with you and he enjoyed life with you. Don't worry man.
He was just a kid and it's heartbreaking that he had to go, but what you did for him is inspiring and overwhelming and beautiful!!!! You can see in the video how excited and happy he was. You did that for him. You gave your heart and soul. Not everyone is willing to do that <3
Bless you

You knew going into this that this was a likely possibility. You knew you could've said no, and none of your viewers would ever know. Yet you said yes, all because this kids dream was to meet you. Wish there were more people out there like that. Fly high Braxton.

God bless, R.I.P
Thank for using your platform to do things like this! You will be blessed beyond for this!! What an amazing person you are and what an awesome little man! Heart is breaking for his family and for you !! #CANCERSUCKS
Very sad. To show that he didn’t let his fight with cancer turn his attitude. He just wanted to have the best time of his life.
R.I.P Braxton I don't know you but I love you and my heart goes out the Weidman family. Jake you are truly an inspiration and continue to make the world more positive. Braxton from the few videos I've seen of you bud you are and will always be the strongest little boy I've ever seen. God gained a beautiful and wonderful angel 💗

RIP Braxton All prayers to you and his family and friends🙏 “My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.” Psalms 73:26
Rest in peace Braxton you're  amazing
My wife & I just finished watching this video. So very sad!! Our hearts go out to the family!!! My wife’s son (my step-son) passed away back in 2018 at the age of 24. Even though he was not as young as Braxton, we know what that pain of losing a child feels like. It’s hard enough when you lose a loved one, but when it’s your child, it’s a unimaginable pain that no parent should ever have to feel. Braxton seemed like such an amazing outgoing child that was full of energy and seemed to be so positive about everything, it would have been awesome to have met him and the family personally but just from watching this video, it sincerely touched my wife and i’s hearts!!!! Braxton is in heaven now and We are sure that he is going on all kinds of treasure hunts up there!!! Our condolences to the family of Braxton!! God bless & our thoughts and prayers are with all of you!!!!  Sincerely, Jason & Danielle  Hagerstown MD
rest in peace fly high❤️🕊😔
Rest In Peace little braxton ❤️ so glad you got to meet him and he got to experience that precious moment with you in life
If everyone 1M people who watched this video donated a dollar we would have $1,000,000 donated ❤️
RIP Braxton, but what's also good is that people like you once they get a little famous, take the time to do things like this, good on you jake
The memory of him lives on for as long as there's people to mention him.  (I don't know if it makes sense in english, but it's a saying from here - which basically means, that when ever someone mentions him or how ever he's mentioned, his memory lives on.)  Wishing the family all the best.
RIP kid
So much love to you and Braxton and his family! Keep doing what you do brother!
REST IN PEACE LITTLE HERO
Rest in Peace, Braxton! You're immortalized here for the world to see! To his family, I'll be keeping y'all in my prayers, and I'm so sorry for your loss!

To Braxton's family and all who loved him, my heart breaks for you. I am so sorry. He did kick butt with 2 T's. I bet there was a discussion sometime about "butt" and "but". Definitely did kick butt with 2 T's. Love to all of you. 😔❤❤❤❤
It's very hard to breathe watching videos like these, my heart goes out to Braxton's family, I'm so sorry for your loss but you're a great man letting that kiddo live out his dream.

💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
To the family: A wise person once said "Passing is evidence that you have lived" Brax's time here may have been short, but you have been blessed to be the facilitator of his living. You saw him through it all. You got to see his smiles, hear his laughs, and witness all the lives hes touched. you got to watch a young boy who had to brave grow up. Brax may no longer be physically present with you and that may never stop hurting, but he FOR SURE still lives on. His legacy still lives, his name will still be heard, and most importantly, his impact will forever be FELT. Brax came to this earth and did what he needed to do.  He didnt deserve the pain, but he deserved all the joy he could have. And you gave that to him as much as you could. May strength be with you. I hope cherishing the understanding that you were the people he loved the most will bring you comfort. May his young, beautiful soul rest in peace🕊
Hate to see you hurting bro, it's sad kids having to deal with illness.
I feel like the most valuable thing ou ever found was Braxton, rest in peace sweet child!

This is one of the things th a pisses me off about rich governments. They have the money to end cancer but so many politicians prefer the money from big pharm. We need to end this shit now so no more kids lose their lives from it.

Awe man. If gods real just why does he let things like this happen to kids? Had me crying like a waterfall T^T
'Your the sweetest heart I’ve ever seen.  Thank you for doing the most wonderful things.  Your an angel on this earth.
I’m so sorry for the loss of such an impactful individual! Your tears aren’t the only ones shed, but because of you sharing. Many heartful prayers for all of you.
Rest In Peace Braxton we miss you! Braxton is a star ⭐️
The CDC, NIH, AMA, and importantly the FDA should be doing a massive investigation into the cause of the epidemic of cancer in children (specifically glioblastoma [brain cancer], leukemia, and lymphoma), the second leading cause of non-accident related death of children in the US,.average age of diagnosis 8. The cause is environmental, not genetic. What do all of these children share in common with different environments, diets, etc.? Why is no investigation being done?
8:15 I'd say his best find is your friendship  lil man. God bless you and your family xX
DAMNIT man this one got me...thank you for giving me faith in humanity again....thank you...your emotions weren't wasted my friend...new sub.
RIP Braxton, He will always be a Hero
For Braxton
💛💛💛💛💛 f&@k cancer
Rest In Peace 🕊
Jake, regardless of what we do in life, you can never tell the lives that you touch. I do children’s ministry at my church and just a couple of hours a week brings a love that is hard to explain. When we do prayer requests, they always ask everyone to pray for “Mr. Anthony” because they know I have surgery on my neck soon. As adults, we are setting examples for the next generation. Braxton loved you and felt a connection with you through your videos. I pray God allows you to be a light to everyone you meet. Never ever forget that what you do reaches so many. I’m 41 and I absolutely love to watch your content. May God bring comfort to you and Braxton’s family.
Kickin butt with 2 t's Words from the truest.
Rest in eternal peace, Braxton. You’re a good man, Jake. I subscribed.
Because of you jake is he was able to pass happily knowing he got to spend time with his idol. Your an amazing guy jake and braxton was one hell of a tough kid he put up a hell of a fight. Rest easy braxton
RIP braxton may he lay in peace
Two TTs
Rip litle man all hero❤❤❤❤❤❤ boy🇲🇳 (mongolia)🇲🇳
⭐️A small but strong new star in the night sky⭐️. RIP, Little boy🌹❤️
My daughters are 6 and 8, I found you through them, their interests and our subsequent YouTube searches. They are continually excited by your videos. Braxton's video is one of their favourites. I don't think that I will let them see this one because of how badly it broke my heart. But we will definitely be having the conversation. I'll probably watch it  a bunch more times, and follow the links. I'm sorry for your loss, and mostly for Braxtons family. He was a bright light, as are you. Honour him by being you, who he so loved. As do we.
((((
you are an absolute legend by doing this for him <3
He was a fight mate
Rest in paradise Braxton 🕊
I kinda shed a tear
Been watching you for the longest your always so happy and smiling and seeing you cry makes me cry literally hurts me. my heart goes out to you and the family #rip buddy  💔

To the Weidman Family: I’m  very sorry for your lose, I don’t understand brain cancer in a child but I do know what it takes, it takes away the best people.. it makes them fight till the very end, instead of just being themselves.. it’s heartbreaking..  I also know that cancer takes the best people in life, I know that first hand however I don’t know what its like for a child but anyways I’m very very very very sorry for your loss you will be in my thoughts
You're an awesome person to do this for Braxton! Rest easy Braxton 💛

Please Jake take solace in the fact that you probably gave this young man the greatest memory he could ever take with him to heaven. This young boy and his family will never forget what you did for them. Your kindness and generosity and compassion towards others is what makes you great. Take comfort in the Lord!

God bless you buddy your love for Brandon and the fact you shared your love and pain with us is beautiful! God please bless Brandon keep him near to you, bless his family and ease their pain. Father we ask this in Jesus Christ our savior's name, Amen.

My heart hurts for the family and little Braxton. But at the same time my heart smiles for the most amazing time you and the family have given him. You’re amazing. Please don’t forget that
That poor family! I can't imagine the hurt they are going through! Nobody should ever see their child pass before them! I'm sure he was a special soul RiP little man!

RIP

Bless you for having such a tender heart . God rest his soul.
R.I.P Little Mate
:( :( :(
Jake, God bless you for taking the time to enrich Braxton's life; he obviously enriched your life as well.  Don't ever lose that tender heart, it's impressive to see a man care for others the way you do.  With all the weird stuff out there, your channel is one that we continue to come back to.  We watch them over and over again, because they are clean, family friendly, you show the real you.  So, when you took Braxton under your wing, it was another outpouring of love from your heart.  When serving others, it's often the one doing the serving who gets the richest blessing.  (I've experienced this time and time again, myself so I know it's true.)    To the Weidman Family: So sorry for your loss, I am truly moved by just the brief exposure of Braxton with Jake.  What beautiful young man.  So well mannered, so loving, it's apparent that you raised your son right. Braxton showed us he is a man with maturity beyond his years, so rare in this world today.  You should be proud of Braxton.  Thank you for sharing him with us.  God bless and comfort your family in your time of loss.
I’m bawling 😭 you’re such a great man. You did all you could to make sure he had the best day of his life ❤️
R.i.p Braxton Fly High Buddy
You gave him the best day of his life, fulfilled his wish 100%, you made him very happy. And he was strong, holding on to the end... Sit tibi terra levis, little Braxton <3
Rest in peace little man! 💔💔💔
Its just so sad :'(
The death of anyone is incredibly sad. But when it’s a child, there are never words for the amount of grief that is felt. Children are the purest beings on the planet and I feel that so much more after having my own son. They deserve the world. RIP little man ❤️ condolences to his family and everyone that knew him ❤️
I’m crying right now and you made he’s day😖😭😢🥺
RIP Little man.....
Anybody else struggle to make it through this video?...bless you man...just take peace knowing you did everything you could to help him and his family smile through such a terrible time
RIP precious one. There’s a wonderful new angel up there.
Jake you made that kids final moments You have a huge  heart my man! Rest in peace
That's a gift the impact you made for a wish rip lil man hug my brother for me love gos out to the family.had me crying God bless and I'll be kicking butt with 2ts <3
SALUTE & massive Respect ✊🏻 to you! Thank you so much for your kind big heart. Being there with the little angel. I can’t allow myself to imagine my son sick like that. His parents are so strong. My condolences go deep & far out to them. ~My sons favorite person to watch since he was about 9 was you. It was our mother son quality time. We live in OR so he constantly went treasure hunting. He was ALWAYS so proud when he’d find cans or a couple coins. It is precious. I even learned a little from you. One day I had lost a ring I loved. It was a pretty strong current. But from watching you with my son. We were both able to grab a hold of some big rocks. And I delicately waved the sand at the bottom to look for it. I didn’t have any gear so I kept coming up for air. I went in probably 10-15 times. But my son spotted the ring from the surface between 2 rocks & guided me to it. With him I was able to recover my ring. We were both so ecstatic. He still treasure dives and treasure hunts. It’s priceless. Keep on keeping on. Your an awesome human being.
This video Just goes to show your bravery honesty and vulnerability I'm so sorry Jake I could not understand how you feel right now but I do know how it feels to lose someone closest to you and I do know that if those who pass on could tell us one thing, it's too keep going and stay strong we love you Jake❤️ rest in peace Braxton 🙏
My thoughts and prayers are going towards Braxton’s family ❤️❤️❤️ lots of love!!
Love you dude thank you for being raw and loving the little dude so fiercely live on for him brother

God Bless…Prayers for all families involved!

Sorry to hear that Braxton passed away.  Keep up the good work that you do.
Kicking butt with two TT’s, hell yeah Braxton. Rest In Peace bud. He passed knowing he was loved and had is dream come true.
rip braxton im praying for you family
I feel so sad for his family
I wasn't ready for this video to hit my feed. Wow, I can't imagine how hard this must have been to get through... I'm proud of you for all you did. You were never obligated to cross paths with Braxton but not only granted his wish, you even checked back long after the fact and were his friend above all else. I'm sorry you lost your friend. He seemed like one helluva good kid. I wish I could've known him.
Jake, you bring out the best in people.  I'm so thankful that you 2 got to meet.  If you're so overwhelmed and in this position ever again, all you have to do is just take a time out.  It was to hard to watch w/you in pain.  Never think less of you for that... Told my son with his "men don't cry mum" business.   showing him this. "sorry bud, Real Men Do Cry".   We all love you bud. Don't forget that's why you're here... For all that you give of yourself.  So with that I say be safe, feel the love and many blessings to you Luv.
R.I.P. Braxton!!!🤧😟☹😰😨😧😥😰😭😢
This was one of the only videos that has made me cry
I’m glad Braxton got to make his wish and have the best day of his life
GOD BLESS KEEP UP WHAT YOU DO IT IS A BLESSING TO SOOO MANY. HAVEA BLESSED DAY AND STAY WELL.
RIP Braxton. Beautiful soul.
I haven't see you cry since you hit 1 mil it's sad that Braxton has passed may he rest in peace

r i p lil buddy
R.I.P Braxton.  I am soo sorry for the families loss.  My thoughts are with you.
R.I.P little champ 💙
If I had one wish and only one I would banish childhood cancer. So many little lives gone too soon.
Should put “kickin butt with 2 Ts” on a shirt and donate all the proceeds to the family
You know I’ve heard a lot of people with health problems, or older people die after a important holiday or day for them, and to know this kid lived his dream before he died and that’s what gets me every time. The feeling of knowing he actually died after something that he dreamed forever, makes my heart ache.   RIP Braxton, you will be missed <3
R.i.p little buddy dude
A moment of silence please
Rest in power little guy
He didn't have enough time to enjoy himself on this earth, but you were the person who made him enjoy himself the most. You lit up his last days.
Never watched befor..liked..sub and commented 4 Braxton and you ..I hope it helps you help .

Braxton, you had the heart of a true treasure hunter. DALLMYD was blessed to have the honor of hunting treasure with you! Fly high big man!
Rest in Peace Braxton.
I was told when someone you love dies especially a child, it means they reached perfection and are no longer able to stay on earth. Braxton reached perfection and is on to his next journey.  Godspeed little man. Love to those left behind until they reach perfection.
R.I.P BRAX🙏
Damn, that sucks. RIP little dude.
Thank you . I lost my dad to brain brain cancer as a kid, am now an adult with kids who love your channel, finding lake superior agate's, and cool rocks. Its not about treasure hunting and getting lost phones, it's about being the difference.
R.I.P Braxton fly high man 🖕cancer
It’s people that matter most in this world. We’ve got to love each other as well as we can in as short a time as we have. It all counts. People count. Thanks @Dallmyd for your authenticity and for being Braxton’s hero! So glad he got to be yours too.

Rip in gods hands
I can not like this video any more. I am truly sorry to the Weidman Family for losing their beloved son to a horrible disease like cancer. I can not relate to how it feels to lose a son but I can relate to losing loved ones especially to cancer. R.I.P. Little man and from now on I am going to start Kicking Butt with 2 T's in honor of this young kid who didn't stop fighting till the last moment. Hopefully everyone decides to share this video with everyone they can because this is a tragic story is heart warming because of people at Make-A-Wish helping those who might not make it to meet that one special person that they never expect to meet. Thank You DALLMYD for taking time out of your life to make some of this kids memory's even better.
Look things happen in life that can make us sad I understand he was a great kid fun kid to hang out with
That so sad 😔🙏
this is so unfair for kids thats my only wish for everyone to live a life they want, your his hero Jake he at least spent his last moments with someone he enjoyed and loved its unfair bro (R.I.P Braxton your in a better place instead of this unfair world) your amazing bro (:

I will pray for you tonight. God bless Braxton, an angel in heaven. Jake, you're a great guy. 💕💕😪
Rest in peace sweet boy in Jesus's arms.  Amen.
He is the lucky one as we suffer here. Praying for the parents! Thats all we can do. Bless u for helping his dreams on earth come true!

RIP Braxton, you will be missed
Rest In Peace Braxton. 🙏
Hey sorry very sorry for their loss! It’s evident he made perhaps a larger impact on you than you did on him  In the thousands of comments, it may have already been suggested but….  What if you created some merch with that slogan “kicking butt with two T’s”  Maybe magnets, t-shirts, window stickers etc  Then all those proceeds could go to the family as well….  Hang in there! My sincere condolences to the family!   Psalms 147:3 He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds [curing their pains and their sorrows].
Rest In Peace braxton
Rest In Peace to the treasure hunting king
Prayers to Braxton’s family

F Cancer. Rest In Peace Braxton.

As a mother my heart breaks for Braxtons family. I can’t even imagine what they’re going thru, and I don’t mean It’s not possibly I mean I CANT coz I’d break. My children are my reason for living as with most parents and this is just so so so tragic. Kids are pure and innocent and shouldn’t have to go thru this, and no mother or father should have to burry their child. My heart goes out to Bractons family x
Braxton fly high and everone loves you so so so much fly high Braxton love you.

Sorry bro Braxton was so cool and I feel bad for the parents I'm not like the parents but my parents are both dead and it is horrible to live through it like that cause you have to live through it for the rest of your life and you think about that the first month is the worst I'm sorry bro and I'm sorry Braxtons parents

I'm sorry for your loss he had such a beautiful soul
I can’t imagine the pain you and Braxton’s family is going though, I hope for a fast recovery for you and his family.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂gg good game
The courage it take to step forward and talk about an event like this is incredible. You obviously meant a lot to this child, and it honestly probably broke every persons heart when they watched this video.   r.i.p. 🕊Braxton🕊   •..=the kid with the crystal=..•
Just know that after his suffering, he is now in a place with no suffering. I will keep his family and you in my prayers.💕🙌🏻🙏
It’s ok jake
Rest In Peace 🙏

RIP🙏 ❤️ 😇👼 💐
Rip so sorry
I didn't realize this had just happened. My heart goes out to there family, as well as you and yours. Looking at how well the donations are doing I am so glad that not only where you able to give Braxton and his family the wish that he could ask for, but rhe help financially with your platform that they didn't. Your a good man, your an even better Make A Wish partner. All love from SC. I hope to see more videos in the future in memory of Braxton. Maybe a community outreach, working with the school in his area, as a last hoorah for Braxton and what he loved.
Rest easy buddy.
Rest in paradise
Such a good kid. RIP Braxton ❤️❤️

🙏🙏🙏
You said you wonder why of all people he chose you. For some it’s not always that big name sports player or race car driver etc etc. sometimes it’s the smaller people who are just great people with big hearts who still have the ability to inspire others in ways they don’t know. God blessed you with that ability. Keep up the great work and inspiration to all. And to little braxton’s family. My prayers go out to you. Rest In Peace bud.
rest in peace 💔😭
My prayers to his family and you… Rest In Peace little dude 🕊

Cancer sucks, such a loss he had such a life ahead of him obviously taken wayyy too soon… Bro you made his day with the adventures very touching, your videos bring happiness to others
Doesnt matter who or what you do... It can make someones day, life for ever... You are Godsent brotha, keep doing you. Never Change
You will forever hold a special place in his heart. Cancer is an evil disease and will take the brightest of souls. Even though his time of earth was short you made someone smile.
You may have made a "little impact" on Braxton, but he definitely made a huge impact on your life, Jake. Thanks for doing this and raising funds for Make A wish and Braxton's family.

Braxton may you go on alot of treasure hunts in heaven.
Some of us are so special, so amazing, that our spirit is too much for the body to handle. A flash in the pan that shines so bright for it's time and leaves the world seeing after images of the incredible soul contained within. To the family my condolences, I did not know your son but what I did see was how he made everything around him better, more special, and memorable just by his presence. Rest In Peace Braxton "Dear Lord, I just ask that you be with the family during these hard times. Hold them in your hands Lord and let them know their son is with you in a better place at peace and happy. I ask that you touch their lives so they know they are not alone and that they will see their baby boy again one day in heaven. In Jesus name we pray, Amen"
rest in peace 😭

Rip
Made me cry
my brother had the same thing and i didnt understand it at the time but i know how hard it is, it doesnt get easier at all it takes a long time, it happend when i was 9, im 18 now and its ever harder then it was for me now then it was when i was 9 and he passed away. Rest in Paradise Braxton hope you see Will up there <3
Dear Braxton rest in peace you angel
God's has him in His loving arms! Take it easy! Jesus Christ will make it all alright!🙏🏾💜🕊️😔
Sending my prayers to Braxton's Family RIP Braxton Let's hope you have the greatest treasure hunt up in heaven🕊
Why does YouTubers aren’t like you… just a real Person infront of only one camera
@DALLMYD I am sorry for your loss. I know how you feel. I have been through want you went through. Rip Braxton I know how you feel. I loss someone also. I that I was close to. I cried litterally, when I heard the news
Seems like Braxton made a huge impact on you.  Cherish that and think about how many other kid's are out there that would love to have that same experience that Braxton had with you.  Rest in peace Braxton, I hope in heaven that you see how many people love you.
I want to reiterate on something Jake said that I don't think a lot of people really took in and understood, the whole "choosing to spend time with Jake when he could have done anything else."  Braxton could have chose anything - anyone - to do an/or spend time with. He chose Jake, a guy who picks up trash underwater and takes us along on the journey. A guy who giggles like a schoolgirl underwater and literally touches fish that most of us will never even see in real life.   Jake is really a special person, one of the very few pure individuals we have in our world. Braxton could see that, and wanted to meet such a nice person.
This video breaks my heart just hearing these horrible things happening to innocent children  Rest in peace Braxton 🙏 and have fun up there in heaven
In my prayers
So sorry to hear this sad news. You did a great thing by being there for him and to show him a great adventure
Maaannn…
So sad to see stuff happen like this, he will forever be in our hearts
Rip I watch the vid 😖😢😭😭😭😭😭

Rest in peace <3
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
This man is crying genuine, real tears, you know he is serious. Jake, I am very sorry. Condolences for your lost and prayers to you and to Braxton's family. Let's hope that champ's in a better place. Take as long as you need to set yourself together Jake. ❤️🙏  Side Note: If there are any troll accounts out there in this comment section (which there probably are sadly), I don't care if it's bait, I show no respect to you.
This is why I watch you. You're selfless and the fact that you want to give away any proceeds you make, instead of keeping it is just amazing
I’m really sorry…. I hope he had a good life and I think you really did a good thing, your a good guy, don’t let anyone put you down, Rest in piece
I think in your youtube banner, you should put a cameo of Braxton to forever have him as a memory
What a beautiful tribute to Braxton. So sorry for your loss. It's ok to sob as much as you need to. We are 😭 along with you.
Descanse em paz Braxton
RIP<3
Rest in peace
Rest In Peace Braxton. May you find all the treasures in heaven ❤️

This would be the first time for me to comment on your videos but I've been a long time subscriber. and I know how you're feeling I felt the same way when one of my grandmother's passed away watching this video I'm not even done watching it I'm 3 minutes in and just watching this video is reminding me of her I didn't go to her funeral because how sad I was I know how you're feeling I know the pain I know the hardship. it just hurts. It hurts everyone go through it in their life that's for other people it hurt way more like me and you I know the pain. The only advice I can give you is stay strong.
RIP little buddy! You were loved and cherished by so many.

You truly are a great human being brother!

Rest in peace !
R.I.P Braxton 🕊🕊🕊
Legend man 👍
It's so hard to lose your child.  Even when you're prepared for it, it's still tough.   I lost two of my baby girls both 15 when they passed.  They had a rare genetic disease called Ataxia Telangiectasia.  They were diagnosed pretty early and they lived pretty hard lives in and out of doctors, months long hospital stays, poked, prodded, operated on.  My oldest had a skin infection for years until they had to amputate her knee.  She then got cancer and had to undergo chemo.  She passed first in 2019.  Her younger sister then passed in 2021.  Make a wish sent us to Disney World back in 2013 when they could still get around some.  We stayed at the Give the Kids the World village for a week and had the best time ever.  Their youngest sister just turned 15 yesterday and although she doesn't have the disease, she's a carrier and that will still impact her life as well.  If she has children they have a 50/50 chance of having the disease.  Her two older sisters are in heaven now with their perfect bodies and I'll bet anything they're showing Braxton around and having a blast together.  ❤️🙏
Rip 😭💔
Rest in Piece buddy. 🥲😢🥺

Thank you for being such and awesome person and granting this kid his biggest wish in the world. The world needs more people like you in it. He is in a better place and is no longer suffering. I know it doesn't make sense why these things happen but this kid touched your heart and changed you for the better and so many others who you shared your experience with. Rest in peace Braxton. Thousands of people love him and will always remember him. To his family, I am deeply saddened for your loss. All of this makes me think about a poem that helps me with the people I have lost in my life.  When tomorrow starts without me by David Romano.  When tomorrow starts without me, And I'm not there to see, If the sun should rise and find your eyes all filled with tears for me, I wish so much you wouldn't cry The way you did today, While thinking of the many things, We didn't get to say. I know how much you love me, As much as I love you, and each time that you think of me, I know you'll miss me too. But when tomorrow starts without me, Please try to understand, That an angel came and called my name, And took me by the hand, And said my place was ready, In heaven far above, And that I'd have to leave behind All those I dearly love. But as I turned to walk away, A tear fell from my eye For all my life, I'd always thought, I didn't want to die. I had so much to live for, So much left yet to do, It seemed almost impossible, That I was leaving you. I thought of all the yesterdays The good ones and the bad, I thought of all the love we shared, and all the fun we had. If I could re-live yesterday Just even for a while, I'd say good-bye and kiss you And maybe see you smile. But then I fully realized, That this could never be, For emptiness and memories, would take the place of me. And when I thought of worldly things, I might miss come tomorrow, I thought of you, and when I did, My heart was filled with sorrow. But when I walked through heaven's gates, I felt so much at home When God looked down and smiled at me, From His great golden throne. He said, "This is eternity, And all I've promised you." Today your life on earth is past, But here life starts anew I promise no tomorrow, But today will always last, And since each day's the same way There's no longing for the past. You have been so faithful, So trusting and so true. Though there were times You did some things You knew you shouldn't do. But you have been forgiven And now at last you're free. So won't you come and take my hand And share my life with me? So when tomorrow starts without me, Don't think we're far apart, For every time you think of me, I'm right here, in your heart.
RIP BRANXTON God bless 🙌
So sorry to hear this brother. You are a good man. You made Braxton’s day!
Rip to a new good people

😭😭😭😭
You made such an impact on Braxton. I have no doubt it meant the world to him to hang out with you. Very sorry for the family's loss.
R.I.P  ❤😭😭😭
It is important that You and your fans were able to touch his life and I can see that he touched yours.  These are the magical special moments that truly matter in life.  Nothing else will truly last, not wealth, not possessions, nor monuments, just the lives we touch and that touch ours, changing who we are and every interaction to come. We will never know the impact we have or the lives we touch.  So it is important to tread lightly, touch gently, speak kindly, and love unconditionally.
This is terrible 😢
No 😭
My condolences and prayers for him and his family.
RiP little Buddy <3
I'm sorry for your loss Jake.  Good on you man.  RIP Braxton

God Bless you and  you should be very proud of everything your doing..   congratulations young man God bless and keep kicking buTT.   YES WITH 2 ts....     God bless the family 🙏

Rest in Heaven at the Lord's side, Braxton.  To Braxton's family, there is no greater battle than for life itself.....and that lil man gets a Purple Heart.  When Jesus came to heal the sick, their illnesses different, he healed them accordingly.  For Braxton, his healing came in the form of entrance into God's great kingdom, the greatest gift of all.  Peace to all touched by his passing.
Being a mother we all pray for a healthy child. But you know it’s the angel’s like Braxton that teach us the greatest lessons and leave a special place in our hearts. Braxton seemed like a great kid and I know he’s in heaven and has found the greatest treasure that we all search for, God and the greatest life in the hereafter! Fly high little buddy!
rest in peace BraxtonBraxton

This little man is in the loving arms of our savior, Jesus Christ. I am so thankful he is no longer suffering.

Rip Braxton 🕊🕊
I'm so very sorry sir! What an amazing little boy and wonderful family!I'm I don't know you sir, but this popped up on my news feed and it was like I just needed to check out the video. I felt drawn to it. I'm so glad that I did. I would like to say to you that you were an inspiration for this precious child and you are a very special person. Not many people would be willing to put aside their own feelings for the benefit of someone else. It's just too hard in a situation like this. Most people would say" I'm sorry" or "I'm praying for you" and then move on. Those words are great but you went above and beyond, placing Braxton first as well as the family. You became an actual living, breathing and tangible gift. You gave to Braxton something that no one else could. He chose you and you literally gave yourself to him. Pure selflessness! What an awesome honor.  Also, may I say how much I appreciate you for being transparent and authentic in your genuine emotions and willingness to share something so difficult and personal to express is very humbling. Braxton will live on in the minds and heart's of many. Thousands who never met Braxton (me as an example) will be able to carry his spirit and share to countless others because of the generosity of his family to allow their child to be an example of what is the best  parts of life. Living each day with the fullness of our ability, strength, perservility, joy, laughter, peace even in the midst of a storm. Most of all Love. Unconditional! It's rare and hard to find! Braxton had it in spades for you! Through the innocence and unadulterated  pureness of a child he became the epitome of what real love is. If we as adults could learn something so wonderful and wise from a little boy our world would be much different. Perhaps we should observe/listen to the children more often! It certainly wouldn't hurt and we just might find the answers to some of life's most  asked questions or the key to many of the seemingly  unobtainable goals we as the so called more wise demographic haven't yet learned. Thank you sir for letting us see into your heart. Your vulnerability was raw yet refreshing. Hopefully each person who stumbles upon your video will be as touched as I am and Braxton's life will have a phenomenal effect on multitudes of people. An amazing legacy from such a beautiful soul and short life. How Incredible! How blessed are the people who knew him! And how blessed are we that have just now met him? We should all strive to have the amount of power in our lives that this young boy had in his little pinky. God Bless Braxton's Family and God Bless You Kind Sir! Sending love from South Georgia!❤️
It is so hard to lose a child!  I'm glad you got to have a wonderful day with him. Hugs and hold you close to my heart. Sending. An Angel to his family for healing
I'm so sorry :( you gave him his wish and that's amazing. My prayers go out to his family.
Dam bro that’s sad
Rest Dow in peace we will miss you forever❤️

So sorry for his family and the loss of your friend. You have such an amazing soul and heart don't ever change ❤️

You are lots of people's hero buddy. Your videos help lots of people by showing what a true human being should be like.  I have mad respect for you mate. Keep up the great energy you have bro. You are one of very few who touch many people's lives and your legend will outlive the dusts of time.  Your purpose is to spread your love bro, you can tell that just from watching one of your videos. You wear your heart on your sleeve, not afraid to show emotion.  Braxton was probably one of the luckiest kids in the world, he met his hero who he aspired to one day become. You would have been a massive part of who he was bro.
One of my favorite of your vids. that little dude was so happy! We all will miss him
What a great kid he was awesome I’m so sad 😭 I’m going to cry
Rest In Peace, Braxton 💔
You gave him his “WISH” and it looked like he had a wonderful day!!! Thank you for taking a day to make his day. I don’t know Braxton or his family but know what you did for them. Your a good man.

You made his dream come true, and that’s magical. Thank you.
May his beautiful soul Rest In Peace 🤍🕊
I believe the term YouTube uses is, "Influencer".  It would seem that Braxton, for all his short years, was exactly that, and much more.  Thank you, Jake, for sharing this story and, thank you Braxton, for inspiring us to live this life to the fullest with the time we have, and kick butt with two "T's".
im so sorry ab that, he will be missed (Rest In Peace)
Braxton was a well-loved boy whom realized his dream with you.  You made that sweet boy's dream a realization.  Very proud of you  and your heart.  My sincerest condolences to Braxton's family and friends.  RIP, Sweet boy!!!
Good job for making him happy! Sorry for your loss. DO NOT donate to the Ronald McDonald House....they are turning down cancer children who are not vaxxed!!😡
Rest easy buddy
I send my deepest condolences to you and the family.🙏🏾
RIP Braxton
Jake, you are a man among men.  My level of respect from day one was enormous and after watching this video, I have even more respect for you. I'm sure he's in heaven telling everyone else up there how awesome YOU made HIS day. Love you brother.  Braxton, Rest In Peace buddy. Your smile & outlook on life is one in a million... just like you. "Kick BuTT w/2 T's lil' man!!".
Rest easy young man. Love and prayers going out for your family.
Rest in Peace 🙏🏼

Much love from the other side of the world Braxton♥️
Jake , sometimes God puts his angels in our path to inspire us and to change us and guide us to a better path. Braxton was that Angel for you. The work you do and your YouTube Channel inspire many ..many people and it inspired Braxton to be like you, what an Honor. Braxton will be sorely missed and you gave him a platform and introduced him to the world. RIP Braxton you have found the best treasure of all.
RIP Little one, you will be missed
Man this really hurts. 😭
I know he’s in a better place but I sometimes still don’t understand why God does this to people.  I know God has a plan for everyone but still why ?   My neighbor lost her only child and my nephew lost his baby.  Why??   Good people don’t deserve to lose!!!   I know someday I will get an answer.  Till then I just have to trust that God needs them worse than we do !! 💙😢💔
RIP
Sorry for your lost Braxton family!!!!

Braxton you are a fighter rest in peace
R.I.P Braxton you will be missed 🙏
Praying for you and Braxton stay strong 💪✊🏼😥😢
My grandmother died to cancer, but we all should look at those who have died to cancer. Not as a loss or defeat in the battle, because if the battle was never going to be won in the first place than there was nothing he could have done different to make it. My grandmother did not loose her battle with cancer, we simply did all we could but it wasn’t enough.
He lived a good life r.I.p
RIP
Knowing all this he is one of the few who truly care about their fans let's have a moment of silence for Braxton
Thank you for making such a special impact on a young person's life.
Rest in peace Braxton 🙏
Rest in peace Braxton, may you find the biggest treasures anyone could ever dream of
I know that there are no words to ease the pain you are feeling. Just wanted to let you know that I am holding you and the Weidmans in my heart and prayers.
The Wideman family is in my prayers. What an awful tragedy. He was such a sweet little boy.

Humbled. Humbled by the things you've done with your life Jake . I wish I had spent more of my years doing things like this . Making the world a better place. Making people happy . He chose you for who you are my friend . R.i.p Braxton . You've touched so many lives in the short time you had. And you'll continue to touch lives in the after .
Damn 🙏🏽
Fly high 🕊💙❤️
Bless you for doing the make a son dream come true for Braxton. I was able to watch the video and the smile you put on his face brought joy to my heart knowing that there is still good people out in this world. God bless you and braxtons family rip little dude I know your up there finding all kinds of treasures with the good lord

RIP BRAXTON. You are loved❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤ R.I.P    💝
I have three children ,I can’t even imagine losing one , I would never be the same 😞  But knowing he would want you to be there for others and ones self . To  even have a life worth living ,one HAS  too move on and you will never forget, this you all know . YOU WILL SEE HIM AGAIN, make him proud and have a life he could be proud of you all having , instead of living in sadness .  My Prayers and thoughts are with you . God Bless you all .
Rest In Peace Braxton!!! DALLMYD you are an awesome person!!!
Very sorry
People push off the fact death is real. Realize it because if you don’t then you won’t live your life to the fullest
Prayers to the family.  You made his dreams come true.  What a great and memorable experience for all.
Rest in peace lil buddy.

It's so often that we are unaware of how much we can influence someone elses life, how much our interactions can mean to someone else.  Wearing green was a sweet touch.  I hope you'll stay in touch with the family. I feel like you will <3
RIP young man, gone far too soon, too bright of a soul for this cold world
Jake you give me hope . With all the bad things going on in the world you make me remember there are still good strong men out there doing the right things

Some times I have to check myself because I want to scream at the sky and ask God why, why so young, why are you being so cruel. I've had to bury alot of friends who have gone way to soon. This broke me though I'm a big tough biker 6foor 5 and I didn't know the kid but I'm in tears just feeling the pain your going through.  Your a good man my friend and you did an amazing thing for that young man God bless you and again my thoughts and prayers are with you and his family

Never seen you before this video...you are an amazing guy, and he idolized you, because of what you do and WHO YOU ARE. I'm sure you would've never imagined the impact your treasure hunts would have on people, and this must have been the most amazing honor. You are blessed. And you have truly given him joy and comfort. Thank you for being so good to him, and loving him the way you clearly do. My heart goes out to you as well. He has given you many gifts to carry with you, and I know you'll cherish them.
Rest In Peace to braxton
My heart goes out to you and his family.  I'm soooo sorry. And the best to everyone involved. Rest in peace little one.💗
So glad you made his wish come true. To Braxton's family so sorry for your loss. Prayers for comfort and healing and good memories. He was so sweet. Ran across this video totally by accident. A short but rich life. RIP.
Just think about it this way you gave him the best time of his life
My thoughts and prayers go out to his family, and you. Fly high Braxton 💙
Praying for the family.

RIP.  I’m sorry to hear he’s gone… I guarantee he’s hugging you in spirit, somehow. Hang in there, life will deal you something to make up for your pain in the future.  And honestly… he found the treasure of a lifetime in a friend like you.

Amazing story. My condolences to the family. Keep up the good work that you do.

So sad
Thank you for your care and compassion. It certainly meant a huge deal to Braxton and his family.
RIP
it hurts to see you like this bro
Kickin butt with two T's sounds like a cool bumper sticker or window sticker. Could be something you sell with your merch with proceeds going to his family and/or make a wish in his name....God Bless you for making his wish come true!
Rip little man 🙏😪
RIP
Tell his parents he we never be forgotten
Good job DALLMYD! YOU ARE AWESOME!! RIP BRAXTON!!
Miss ya
Braxton is finding amazing treasures in Heaven.  May he rest in peace.
Rip kid I loved his video with you I liked and I’m commenting pay respects to him he was a good kid I feel sad even though i don’t know him also hope he has a good respect ✊ and his family I hope that get throw this time bye ✌️
Kids can identify great people!🥰
Stay strong brother Jake
Rest in peace Braxton
I cant watch this, I'm starting to tear up also.
You have a good heart. Many get too caught up in the daily grind to reflect of just how fragile life is. To be a hero to even 1 person is what we should all strive for.
It’s been 4 days and already there has been 5 million dollars raised just shows how good the YouTube community can be
Tough story to hear being a father to a young child. Thank you for making this kid's wish come true. RIP Braxton
You were a great kid Braxton thanks for turning so many peoples hearts warm especially your family. You will live on through them, through us, and through Jake forever! May your soul live on🖤
all my thoughts are with the family and you too he is looking down on you and saying to god if you believe in him look that guy was the best person in the earth and you well see him again as i well see my grandad again i well see him too and braxton if you are watching up there in the stars you are loved by all of us all your family loves you and all on here love you too always remember that and if braxtons family are reading this place do not be sad we all see each other again as i well see my grandad again you well see him again to he well be waiting for you  all best from daniel fisher

Damn bro 😔 chin up jake! You're an amazing human being, the world needs more people like you. So sorry for the loss
Gawd damn you childhood cancer, just gawd damn you.
Just went to rewatch that video, brother you made that kids day! Always remember the great things and memories you were able to give him. God bless you Jake RIP Braxton :(
Commenting for Braxton. RIP little hero x
Prayers and Love to Braxton and his family. ❤️
The devil hates children. Pray over your kids. Pray Psalm 91 over them
Great job Jake!!
Salute you brother ..  Rip young one
I love that you are not scared to show how you feel thank you ! You have him the best day he could have asked for ❤️🙏🏻
R.I.P😔😔
Weidman family, I don't know what Jake would say the most precious thing he has ever found is (I think I do - but I can't speak for him); but as far as I can say for myself, the moist precious thing he has ever shared with his viewers was the joy of a young man who wanted, more than ANYTHING else, to hang out with Jake and kick butt with two T's. Seeing that video, and the joy in Braxton's and your faces, made all of us better people. We all share your loss of your dear child, and send thoughts of comfort, peace, and healing your way; Braxton has found his at last. Blessings be with you all in your time of loss, and remember that you are never alone.  Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine, et lux perpetua luceat eis - Amen
You are a good man, Jake!  You have a heart of gold.
Rest In Peace little man, you are truly my hero!
Thanks for giving Braxton this great day! It's obvious he truly loved you - he was so tough and so brave. And he never felt sorry for himself. Truly the most special person I've ever seen. He will never be forgotten - nor should he be. #BeLikeBrax
fly high braxton
Don't worry now he is in a better place in heaven
This is truly very sad, i hate seeing a little kid not get to live there life fully, it doesn’t seem fair at all, I’m glad you made his dreams come true before his final day did come, that kid deserved everything, and he was the sweetest kid, RIP Braxton ! You will be remembered for awhile
I wish braxtons family and All of the other Near People like auntie and uncle to fight through it he was o you to die but he will never be forgotten RIP 🪦
Rip Braxton
Damn 😔
R.I.P Braxton...😢My heart goes out to his family.😢 Thank you Dallmyd for  making Braxton wish and dream came true....👌
RIP Braxton 🙏
❤️
THANK YOU BRAXTON WEIDMAN’S PARENTS FOR ALLOWING US TO BE PART OF HIS TREASURE HUNT WITH JAKE‼️ The bravery and strength you instilled in him are an inspiration to all of us that got to see it!!
I just stumbled upon this video through luck, I'm sorry for the loss but the inspiration I gained from this and hearing the quote "Kickin' butt with two t's" Is unforgettable...R.I.P. Braxton!
Rest in peace buddy we love you 😘💜
This is sad to hear he was so young no one this young should go rip
Rest easy Braxton you were the best treasure hunter to walk this beautiful globe🌎 🙌🏾
He probably said kicking but with two ts because thats how he probably remembered the difference between but and butt, ik that's how I remembered as a little kid. It's so sad to see someone so innocent and young be taken away so early. Dosnt feel fair, my prayers go out to his family and everyone touched by Braxton
Braxton had a great time. Rest in peace!
R.I.P
Rest in peace Braxton 🙏
Rip bud
such a brave stong kid no one should have to deal with anything like that at that age, Rest in peace Braxton
Sorry for your loss !
Im truly sorry to hear that Braxton had passed,that video was amazing you made a great impact on alot of us as well as Braxton has .we thank you for all you do your a great person .God bless you n Braxton's family.R.I.P BRAXTON......
I am so sorry for him RIP
🙏
Jake, my brother, it doesn't matter if you blessed him for a day, a week, or a year - but you gave that little boy incredible joy. At your age you have not felt this sting as often as older folks have (I'm 58, and tired of these stings) - but you have to remember the joy you gave him in the midst of his pain. The time will come when you will be able to do that (yes, it will) - until then, please keep in mind that in sharing that joy with the YouTube family you have gathered, you made one HUGE number of smiles and warm hearts. The tears we share with you are not a bad thing - but the joy will outlast the tears. Thank you for being you, and for sharing your kindness with the rest of us - and most especially with that young man and his amazing family.
I was not expecting to cry today man 🤦🏼‍♂️ you got a big heart and so did this little man. Thank you for giving this kid the best joy you could
Jake, Mannnnnnn, HUGE THANK YOU for being so real! BRAXTON is Cancer Free, & Free Indeed!
GOD BLESS YOU SIR, good Heart
Such a sweet boy.  Prayers for his family.
@dallmyd  always loved your videos. And this entire video is the reason you’re one of the guys I admire on here. Not too many people are willing to be open and emotional with people. Have to give you all the respect and hope that you continue to make peoples dreams come true.   You’re an amazing human being.
I am so sorry DALLMYD take your time ok
Rest In Peace 🙏🏽🙏🏽❤❤
You are a good man D , prayers for you and the family. Fly hi Lil bubby ! We know you are running and playing in your new body!

But what you have done for Braxton was a dream come true and you was his hero. You are a genuine earth angel that has done a small amount to keep evil from over ruling this planet. My heart and thoughts are with Braxtons family and friends People like you and braxton are the salt of the earth. RIP BRAXTON 🤗
You did such a great thing for that little guy. You have him what he wanted most! A great day of treasure hunting....I know it hurts.....but you made him smile!

As a parent of a make a wish kid your video was both inspiring and heart breaking. The magnitude of your emotion shows how much you really cared and that you were not in it for views or for monetary value! You a light ! Never change !

FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST, WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE  EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER. John 3:16 Bible....THE RAINBOW🌈THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE, Revelation 4 and Revelation 22 Bible. And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.🔥This is the second death. Revelations 20 bible.... ❤️I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. 2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” 5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”❤️ 6 And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. 8 But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone,🔥which is the second death.”..  Revelation  21 b.i.b.l.e.....Have a sweet week
this is so sad man. RIP Braxton
God will watch over him. He’s there with him in heavenly paradise. The place where there’s no pain and his suffering is done. Waiting for his family to see them again.  “I am he who hath lived and was dead and behold I’m alive forever more. And I bare the keys to death {heaven} and hell.” - Revelations 1:18.  RIP Braxton Weidman ✝️🙏🏻♥️ “Kicking butt with two T’s.”
Big respect goes out to you you're a hero and you are amazing
That's just not fair!  Rest In Peace 🖤
I'm sorry  😢😭
Man, this guy really gonna monetize a make a wish kid, Jesus christ
For the family keep your hearts full off love for your lost son I think everyone’s heart goes out to you guys he seemed like a wonderful boy we don’t understand why god takes them so young but there a reason god has a plan for BRAXTON
That's some bulls****, is situations like this, that makes me think where's God, where's Jesus. I the bet family pray till the last moment. Screw going to the moon, he'll with unnecessary technology cell phones, iPad, nuclear weapons, surveillance. Maybe we need more focus on critical situation as this
My condolences to the family, Braxton fought the best he could but god loved him more. Rest in peace buddy.
❤️❤️
RIP Braxton.
Thank you so much for sharing this with all of us. I means so much ❤️ I hope you are all okay. Kicking but with 2 ts is because your butt is spelled with 2 ts 😁. But that's so Amazing 🤩. Thank you for helping the world to know him in a little way.
❤❤❤❤ love from Norway
Such a beautiful little boy so sad I couldn't stop crying either. Praying for Braxton and his family!!!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 God has his arms wrapped around Braxton and he is happy and safe!

RIP😔
All my love!!!
Jake you are an amazing person and you made his wish come true you are his hero ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ all my love to the family xx
To his family your little boy touched millions of peoples hearts and shined a light on childhood cancer. No one deserves to go through losing a child parents are always supposed to go first. No words anyone can say or money could ever rectify what you have been through. May your little boy rest in peace i'm sorry for your loss.     "kicking Butt With 2 T"s"
If only he could see you as you make this video
I honestly feel so bad he’s so sad and how he loved him so much and will probably never forget him . I started to tear up just listening😭😢kicking butt with two t’s😢 Rest In Peace
My condolences fam, It's ok to greive, I work in Public Safety and it's never easy seeing someone go through something like that, especially kids, their innocent and have so much to look forward to. Glad you were able to be there and make his dream come true.
R.I.P Braxton. Thanks for sharing Dallmyd. much love from sweden❤❤❤
R.I.P, fly high little angel
My Condolences go to his Family Rest in peace Braxton

Im not crying its just alergys.......
Aww good kid, May he rest in piece. At least he’s got a hero to watch explore the deep, it’ll be alright Dall. You made that kid smile every time he saw you, your a good man, ain’t see many people who are as kind as you. He passed after having the most amazing day hanging out with you.
Rip Braxton 🕊🕊
Jesus this video destroyed me and I don't cry at much. What a beautiful little boy. Thank you for sharing him with us and for making his wish come true 💖. Rest in peace sweetie 💖 sending lots of love to your family 💖
man.....that really suck's, imagine having cancer that would suck and this kid fought so hard  he deserves sooooo much (r.i,o)
R.I.P Braxton may your after life be amazing in heaven
💙braxton💙
RIP Braxton I wish his soul get piece 🙏
Rip
So sorry, Jake. You touched sweet little Braxton at the end of his life and what an honor! You made Braxton so happy!!!!! Poor little guy to have to go through so much in his short life. RIP sweet boy.
<3
People may disagree with me over this and I really don't care but its because of little kids like this that I believe that God exists and that we will see them again because saying he dont exist is a insult to everything this boy was in life he deserves to be able to go on and be happy in a place where he can never feel pain again. People have a right to believe what ever they want but kids as special as the one in this video deserve to be in a place where they are happy and not suffering he deserves that and more.
im almost crying ffs
Rest in peace little man. Sleep easy.  X
You were such a bright kid with a great heart and soul love and support to the family fly high Braxton!!

As a NDE survivor I can tell you he is in a great place and can feel all the love and support we are sharing with you. He will always be treasured in hearts.  Dalley we are here for you brother your a great soul.
You are a wonderful human. Heartbreaking situation.
Things like this seem very unfair when it happens but we have to stay strong for Him because that’s all he would want. ❤️
Heartfelt Jake🥺, rest easy little dude, what you did for Braxton on that day was amazing Jake, I remember your vlog and it was very emotional to watch and special. You gave him that little bit more fight that day. "Kicking Butt wit 2 T's" thankyou for sharing and being YOU and giving hope, joy and some of your energy to your audience too 👍
When you started to cry I knew what had happened I'm sorry bro R.I.P😢
Aw man I’d trade my worthless life for his anyday at least he has a family that totally adores him. And such a little cutie

Rip Braxton the most coolest and sweetest child of all time all of us will miss you bud😭😭😭😭
❤️😢
Condolonces Mate.
Oh no man… you did a great thing for  the young lad Braxton, his episode was so uplifting. It was great to see him having fun and living his dream, searching with you. It was reaffirming to see an example of “the good stuff” people do, during a personal rough patch. Seeing my colleagues from over the pond doing their bit was also encouraging for me to see. I’m gutted for you,  it is very sad to hear this news. My thoughts are with his family. Despite having worked closely with a few parents who have lost children, I still find it hard to imagine. My little girl (who’s a huge fan) is my world. So, I sincerely hope his family, especially his parents have all the support they need and can somehow manage to find their way forwards. A lovely young man, who’s strength of character amplified across oceans, inspiring a burnt-out firefighter to get back on his feet. I’m so very sorry for your loss. Hold fast Jake ✊👨‍🚒 nothing but respect for you mate. Yours is one on a shortlist of channels I allow (and in your case, actively encourage) my little girl to watch. Cleaning up the mess is humans make, having outdoor adventures, and of course your outstanding acts of kindness win my vote all day long. (I’ve edited once but eyes are somewhat blurry so please excuse and remaining typos).
I'm going back into working with kids/ w disabilities...and part of that reason is Braxton and you...Praise the Lord🙏💜🙏
RIP i want to cry
LLB. RIP Braxton
I'm sorry for your loss sir.
My heat goes out to the family big time so sad 😞
My Prayers are with you all 🙏

Much love man ❤❤❤❤
Love you rest in peace Braxton hope your catching treasure up their in heaven to 🥽🐟
I’m sorry to the family. I cannot imagine going through this and I’m so sorry and feel so bad for y’all. I wish I could say the right words to make it better but I know nothing ever will. I just wish I could give y’all a hug. You raised a great lil man and even if it was just for a little bit he touched so many lives and reminded us what’s important. God bless y’all and God bless Braxton..
Out of sight but NEVER out of the heart !!!
You did the most important thing anyone can do for another in that position. The only thing we take from this world are the memories we create and you made a fantastic memory possible for him
Rip 🕊
This is hard to watch man. Rest in peace.
Awesome little treasure hunter
May he Rest In Peace . His soul was ready to move on after all the joy and eternal memories you created with him ❤️❤️
What a sad and beautiful thing all in one,I'm very sorry for his family and yourself, He got his wish and it shows your influence made a difference to his life and enjoyed the excitement of what you do.   His treasure that he wanted to find was you and he found it.  You should be very proud of yourself.  Rest in peace little fella
Rest In Peace little man❤️
❤️
Rest in peace braxton
Poor baby :( may he Rest In Peace :( we love u Braxton 💜🕊
Really touched by that video. Braxton was just a kid who wanted to have fun is a perfect resume. Life is unfair took one wonderful little boy but you got the chance to cross his path and he was probably the best fan of yours. You now have something to remember how good you need to be and how war you have to go. This little boy dream is in your hand never let it go.   For the incredible family my condolences. This little was a piece of joy and you supported him until the end supporting him to see his favorite buddy on the planet.  Braxton you brought so much happiness in the videos. Rest in peace and I hope that where you are a lot of treasures are waiting for you to discover them.
Rest In Peace Braxton
I’m sorry for your loss.
God bless you to continue to do what you do and make everyone smile 🥰
May our Father bless you Jake. You’re a true hero bro.
It was far more than just a little impact that you made on that kids life. Hang on in there. May his soul rest in a better place.
I'm setting here craying that's so sad 😭😭😭😭
Rest up big guy 🙏🏾🙏🏾
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥Be strong.
You are so incredibly man.  Rest in peace Braxton.
Jake, I understand you are grieving for Braxton. I is awesome he choose you and after watching your video. You made that child’s dream come true; you are awesome. Braxton really had the best day ever!! Your contribution to ‘make a wish foundation’ is the best I have seen so far. You gave him the best treasure hunt he could ever image, with all the bells and whistles. Braxton is now with our Lord telling him his best wish ever. Jake it hurts now but remember his face handing over the gun to the Police, you can only smile. God will comfort you and his family in His Loving arms. God bless
Rest in peace little man ,my heart goes out to the family and your self keep your head up in memory of braxton
R.I.P Braxton, My Prayers are with your Family and Friends 😇💔❤‍🩹
Rest In Peace Braxton ❤️
Thoughts & prayers to the Weidman family!!  You raised an amazing, curious, smart & strong boy in Braxton!  It's wonderful that he picked Jake so we all had a chance to see him & get to know him, if even a tiny bit.  #PeaceForBraxton ✌💚💚🙏💚
Much love man!!
Braxton you shall be missed. R. I. P.

First of all, my prayers and support g out to the Weidman family!! It's hard to lose a loved one, but I can't imagine the pain of losing one's child!! May God continue to strengthen and console you in this difficult time!! Jake, I wish to thank God for the work you do on this channel.. especially when it comes to impacting children for good!!!!

i hate braxton
Hey jake, I can see this definitely took a toll on you. Just be sure to keep doing what you do. I’m grateful for what you do man. This bring tears of joy and tears of pain, life sucks and I feel for you and his family. Just know that you gave him the most joy of his life.
My baby brother (36) was just killed in a massive car crash 1-3-22. He left behind 5 kids (4 boys and 1 girl ages 17, 11, 9, 7, and 5)! It has been so incredibly devastating for all of us but I know he's with my 6 children I lost (4 miscarriage and 2 stillbirth). I know the pain and disbelief his family is going thru and my prayers and love are with you all
❤️
RIP Braxton. I remember watching that video, I thought Braxton was having the best time of his life...sometimes, it's the simple things that mean the most. Everyone has a different take on what is "awesome"...it's all a matter of perspective.
Jake you are an amazing person with a beautiful soul. I love that you show your pure true emotions without trying to hide them. That makes you an outstanding man! You make a difference in many lives but this one I say is #1. I will keep you and the family in my prayers. Fly High Braxton, watch over your loved ones.
he was just a kid why it’s everyone being a little baby stop crying kid L bozo + dead
Rest in Piece little guy.

my best friend passed away from cancer 6 years ago. her mom texted me after she passed, and I will never forget the pain i felt when that message came. it is without a doubt the most painful thing I've ever experienced - I don't think I've ever cried that hard before. it's something you never get over, and I don't speak for everyone, but from personal experience, it does get easier with time, at least a little bit. my thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones🖤
We all love you so much Braxton nay you rest in peace ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😇
God Bless You and Braxton family in Christ Jesus!
Damned
My deepest symothy and condolences.May God comfort his family and friends.Rest in Peace Braxton.
I’m a fellow Braxton myself loved watching that video may he Rest In Peace no kid should ever have to go through what he did
You should make shirts, "Kicking Butt with 2 T's"  proceeds to the family
May god welcome him with open arms rip 😞
People say how real men don't cry and they don't have emotions a real man isn't scared to show his emotions and this is awesome how he really truly cares about this kid and he's showing emotions he's crying and that shows that he really cares and he's a good person and I'm sorry for your loss I hope everything gets better he was a cute kid you guys are awesome
I’m sorry for the hard feelings your feeling right now in life, I know he impacted you like you impacted his life! Stay well man and take care of yourself! I’m sorry for you and I’m sorry from Braxtons family! All love goes out to everyone who was affected ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Your amazing!! Real men show emotions. Love you keep doing amazing work ❤ 💗 💖 💕
God bless them all who knew him.
Wow so sad 😭 my thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Braxton 🙏🏻 glad you could make his wish come true Jake, the world needs more good people like you to spread joy in peoples lives ❤️
You’ve got a big heart. Keep up the good work. Impacting children in a positive way is the most rewarding thing you can do for them. Good job. RIP Braxton.
It's wild how just a couple days could impact someone so much both you and the little man we could see how broke you was by it . Rip little man ❤
Rest in Peace little Fighter <3

Thank you so much Jake for everything you did for Braxton. You put a smile on his face and helped Braxton fight for that long. I was so great full to see you supporting at the funeral two days ago and I could see the joy that you brought to the family because for them to know that you loved there son and you loved one of my friends was amazing I could not ask for more than what you did. “Yeah buddy.”

This is the only time i saw this much in a situation at all condolence for you and the fam of braxton
noooooooooooooooo rip
UPDATE 2/6/21: Braxton, I'm honored that you chose me for your Make-A-Wish. Your ceremony was absolutely beautiful buddy. Your family is so amazing. Everyone kept saying how I was your hero and how I positively affected your life, but you did that to me ten fold. You've inspired me to live the best life I can. You're family said green was your favorite color, so I wore green for you at your funeral. Save some treasure up in heaven for me! We miss you bud. Lets live our lives "Kicking butt with 2 T's" just like Braxton!

Awesome story, sorry man that’s a hard one swallow. Just be happy you made his life a little brighter
Jake, you have such an A-Mazing soul brother. I don't know too many YouTubers or people in general that would put themselves out there like you have in this video. You are definitely a one of a kind as was Braxton. Honestly I believe that is why he was so drawn to you. Both of your are complete Rockstars. Never let pride change who you are brother.  I see you in a whole new light now my friend. Never stop being who you are. Thank you for sharing this I know it was probably the hardest video you have ever had to make. You have a lifelong fan here after that. Jake sincerely, thank you!!!!!!!!💕💕💕💕💕
Damn this hits hard.

I’ve never watched a single one of your videos. I came here off of recommended. But, as a father, to a preemie…this is my biggest fear. And, I could only hope, God forbid that if it’s ever anything I face. I would hope that someone like you is the person that answers that call. Massive respect.

Experience a similar situation. A couple from South Carolina rented an apartment in Kentucky from my wife. Their son about Braxton age also had cancer and was being treated at St Jude hospital in Cincinnati Ohio. Sweetest little boy with a southern draw who only wish was to be a chef. Unfortunately he also lost his battle with cancer. This story gets worst. The couple other son was diagnosed with anther form of cancer. He was a senior in high school. They also stayed at my wife’s building , free of charge while their son was in treatment. Sadly he also passed.  Losing both your children to two different kinds of cancer is unbelievable. So sorry for them. Tears continue to flow when hear these kind of stories.  Thanks for making one tough guys wish come true …
Rip
rest in peace :)

I don’t really cry but this made me cry
Make a wish is canceled… I love this video and you but they’re canceled they told a kid he wasn’t dying fast enough for them to grant him a wish and that’s unacceptable.
RIP and God Bless Braxton 🙌
We will miss him it sucks that we lost him I love you and his family
Rest in peace  Braxton
so sad😭
Rest In Peace 🥺😢.
I truly understand why he inspired you. You are one amazing person. May Braxtons soul Rest In Peace.

Rest in Peace
Jake i watched that video and i kinda figured that you might of planted some stuff. That being said you made him very happy i commend you on that. I am sorry to here that he passed away that is horrible. I had a Boss and a really good friend that i had known  since 5th grade. They both past away from Glioblastoma. My friend from school was a carer Navy man and was pined a Commander just before he passed. It made my so sad to actually have to feed my friend and watch him go down hill. I will forever miss him. i was honored to be able to help out with him as i was off work due to a knee injury. I was the only non Navy pole barer at his funeral. I was very honored to be the only civilian and the only friend from school to do this. You are a great person to be able to make him happy. I wold love to be able to do things like that. As sad as it is that he passed you made his short life for being the person you are. RIP Braxton.
I know no one probably won’t see this nor will you but I just recently had brain surgery to take a tumor out, it was non cancerous and in the pineal region and it was one of the hardest things I’ve had to go through and waking up everyday just depressed and sick all the time and I’m so much pain but I really want to say you will always be remembered lil bro and that you fought strong and hard and I’m proud that you wanted to inspire other ppl to also help the environment and stuff but from the bottom of my heart we all love and miss you Braxton.
Fly high🥺🕊❤

Rest in peace lil man!!!
Rest in peace braxton ur a gem keep hunting for gems buddy hope u find a rare gem😭😥😥🙏🙏🙏
Brother each of us has a book of life that is written for us. There are only two chapters pre-written, the chapter of we are born and the final chapter when we pass on to the next life. The book of life is a mystery novel, where we fill the pages with the story of our life and the lives of others we interact with. You gave Braxton the wish he wanted more then anything, not only did you give him that one wish, you bonded with him and his family and stayed a part of his life. It is an extremely difficult time for you and Braxton’s family. If you can try to memorialize his life by remembering how great of a little man he was. Even though his physical presence is no longer here on earth, he continues to live in your mind and forever in your heart. You can be at peace knowing that you wrote a wonderful chapter in his book of life, as he did in yours. You and Braxton’s family are in our prayers during this difficult time. Rest In Peace Braxton as you are now being fitted with your golden angels wings so you can soar around the heavens.
Rip 😔
😢
I’m so sorry to hear about Braxton’s passing.  Prayers of peace and comfort.
Rip
Fly high buddy. Treasure hunt up there. Rest In Peace
RIP Braxton. You're a gem.
You sweet little love you kick buTT in heaven. Thank you for giving him the wish he truly wanted!
You got a good heart matey, sometimes you just never realise that no matter how simple you yourself think your videos are or if you think they're no good, they make a difference to someone out there, and they lift someone's spirits.  Never give up and, keep up your fantastic work. From your friend down under,   Rory
braxton is the gratest litte boy ever

You fought a big battle and God decided he wanted his precious child home to not endure any more pain or worry - you will truly be missed

Rest In Peace Braxton. #MiniMYD
Rip little man
Rest In Peace Braxton you will be greatly missed. Cancer is a terrible thing for anyone, my little sister had brain cancer that she fought for about 2 years. There were countless prayers and mental breakdowns asking god why he did it but with the grace of god she has been cancer free for over 2 years and is kicking everything ass. There will be lots of prayers for the Weidman family as they recover from Their loss.
You know you really never know anyone until you become friends you think that what your doing isn’t much but just to be there for them they mean the most to them you are a great man Jake you did best thing for him Rest In Peace Braxton
🙏
Thats a huge experience that you got to have with that lil guy, it's got to be a honor knowing that all he wanted to do was to hangout with you hunting for treasure!. Those are huge shoes to fill. U did a great job bro.

OK first never forget the time you had with him, also I am a correctional officer and that is something that is on my goals list is to help fulfill wishes. 2nd create a cool t shirt to help raise money and awareness of make a wish. And last keep your head up high man and remember he chose you to be his wish granter that is a honor few get to participate in.  He will be missed RIP little man. I'll be praying for the family and you.
God bless that kids heart man it's so sad how your life can just end just within a snap of a finger. @DALLMYD u are a great man for showing that kid a good time in his life u made him so happy and he is still happy looking down on all his family and u cause u gave him something no one hardly gets to see the role model. God bless Braxton family. Rip  Braxton.
Much love to you my brother , May Braxton rest in peace prayers to his family, Rest in peace Braxton 🙏❤❤❤
happy treasure hunting in heaven big man
I started crying when he said he was holding the Crystal
I was on the verge of tears the entire video and then seeing “He will be buried with the crystal you gave him” got me.
You will be missed braxton
Rest In Peace, Braxton. My prayers go out to his family. Keeping you in my thoughts!🙏🏼
Braxton, you were a true fighter and you never let anything bring you down. You were a tough cookie and it’s heartbreaking to see you leave. I know you’re metal detecting and treasure hunting in Heaven. Rest In Peace little buddy.
rip Braxton you will be missed little man
Rest In Peace Braxton
Rest in peace Braxton. You're one amazing little guy. Fly high . And prayers for all your family and friends.
As the father of a "wish kid", thank you for granting Braxton's wish and sharing it with the world. MAW is an amazing organization that changes lives and gives these kids something to look forward to in their darkest days.  Keep up the great work!
"Kick Butt with 2 t's" Quote from Braxton. I will remember this forever
Chin up jake you made braxton who he wanted to be for the day you're a good role model bro keep it up. Rip braxton
Rest In Peace Braxton. I hope you are finding lots of treasure in heaven.
You're not in pain anymore little guy. Rest in Piece Braxton.  Just isn't fair for a little one to have to go through something like that.
Rest In Peace Braxton :(
Man that sucks I’m so srry fly high our little king
i am so sorry
Hes only gone till we gorget but i dont think that will happen every fly high 🕊🕊🕊
You are an amazing man, keep your head up. Braxton is in a better place and finding treasure pain free.
I just wanted to tell you what you did for Braxton was amazing. Our son passed away from cancer in 2020 and someone special took time out of his day to do the same for my son before he died. It meant everything to my son, so I know what you did for Braxton made him so very happy and meant the world to him.  Thank you.
Rip Braxton,  🙏  great work Jake from for being that support and model to him
Rest In Peace Braxton 🙏🏽
Rest in peace little buddy .
Rest easy Braxton ❤️
Rest in peace Buddy.
Rip fly high budy
Keep your head up jake. You made that kids dream come true. And his family will be forever thankful for you. Love you Jake. Here for you if you wanna talk
This was the first time I've ever seen him cry and honestly it hurt
Rest In Peace little man🕊
RIP 😭😭😭😭😭😭
you're a great man
You have such a great heart! It’s unfortunate to see anyone especially a child loose a fight to cancer. Rest In Peace Braxton. ❤️
I’m so glad he got to spend time with you, I’m sure it meant the world to him. I’ve worked/volunteered with a children’s cancer charity for about ten years, and seeing beautiful lives with so much potential lost never stops being absolutely devastating. I hope you find peace in knowing, as overwhelming as it may be, he got to do his once in a lifetime experience because of you and that is something he carried with him forever. Life is too often short and fragile, what you did for and with him was extraordinary. Condolences to you and Braxton’s family, I’m so sorry for your loss. Fly high Braxton ❤️
R.I.P. little man fly high bud 👼🏻🕊
RIP Braxton, dead ass teared up
Fly high as you need miss yea bud🙏😇

Rip
Rest In Peace 🙏🏻
I know how you feel when you hear that a kid died from cancer or some other disease and you feel helpless.. Just know that out of everything in this world he chose time with you.. That you mattered more then anything in the world… Be honored and blessed and go forward and continue to help others as you do and be the amazing person you are..  it is hard not to get upset and sad and wish you could have done more to help.. You did the best thing and made his day… I could not watch the video till today because death is a close to home thing.. I lost 5 people in 1 week and one was my dad… We got back in touch 4 years before he passed and it was the best thing in my life.. Sadly I had to let him go.. If I ever get married I will have no one to walk me down the isle or dance with…. He was my world and I miss him every day…
Ive been following this channel for a long time. You always do everything you can for everyone else Jake, its truly inspirational.
Rest In Peace buddy, fly high🕊❤️

None of us know when our last breath will be. But we can know for sure where our very next breath will be. All we have to do is believe, trust in Jesus's finished work on the cross. He paid our sin debt in full and rose again on the third day.  Trust in that and you too will spend eternity with Him and Braxton. Maranatha!
Rest in peace Braxton. 🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️

He had a blessed kind family and his favourite youtuber together on those couple days! He loved you and his family so much. You may miss him a lot but he’ll always be in your memory and the video is there to remind us that to always live with love around us. The moment its gone, its hard to fill in the void. We need to be strong and continue to love them even while they are gone. ٩( 'ω' )و

RIP Braxton
R.I.P Braxton
Jake,  I'm not sure if you will ever read this,  but you are doing the work of Jesus himself.  You blessed this beautiful child in a mighty mighty way.  Perhaps your name dallmyd is really the serving of Thee All Mighty!  Braxton is in the arms of Jesus now.  No More pain,  sorrow,  frustrations, disappointments or worry.  Pure unending joy and love for all of eternity until we all meet up again.   To Braxtons Parents, may God carry you and your family through this hard time. You were part of something so much bigger than you will ever realize.  The God of the universe chose you to bless this little beautiful innocent child right into heaven.  Please don't look at this as a negative,  as it is easy to do,  but realize that if you hadnt had shown him your love,  Braxton wouldn't be with Jesus right now.  I am so sorry for your loss.  We are praying for you here in Texas.  May The Lord bless you and keep you,  may the Lord make His face shine upon you and be gracious toward you, may the Lord turn His face toward you and give you peace.  Numbers 6:24-26
🦢🕊📿🕊🦢
Sorry jake

Rest In Peace little Braxton, you will be remembered for your smile. May you treasure hunt in another life

Rip Braxton and amazing job for fighting cancer
He’s going to remember you. Jake your a legend.
Rip to a amazing little cute kid we will never forget you we will miss you so much 😢❤️❤️ he was a amazing kid my heart dropped when I seen this
Good bless you Jake and all you do. You made this kids day. I know it can be a cruel world,but there is a plan for all of us. He was so you and full of life,but I'm sure Braxton had accepted his terms the best of his abilities. For him to get a chance to treasure hunt and hang out with you, I'll bet you made a beautiful sunny day to a cloudy situation. It's really great the stuff you do,cleaning the environment,giving lost items back to people that thought they'd never see them again. I watch all your videos and am very proud of you for the things you do,and the person you are. Thank you.
Rip lil man. Sorry for the family. Praying for the family
Can I came with you to help you.
Oh, Jake. We are so sorry for such a huge loss. You can be sure that you made a difference in that little boy's life. A long-lasting difference. As you said, he could have selected any kind of activity to take part in for his WISH. But he chose YOU. We think he chose a very good role model to follow.  You showed Braxton that it is OK to be a kind and honest man. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his Parents. How shattered they must be.  I cannot imagine the pain of losing a child. May God hold them in the palm of his hand and bring them PEACE.
Rip Braxton
Rest in peace😇🙏
Rest in Peace Braxton, Fly High Man!
Rest In Peace buddy.
You made his wish come true! He had a happy ending and you should be so honored🥰

Sorry for your loss sending prayers 🙏. Braxton is flying high with the angels RIP 🙏.
Rip
rest in peace braxton. jake god is taking good care of him i know it
It is ok Jake we all know that Braxton will be alive in us and he will be so happy to see you soon
Rest In Peace, Braxton.   Jake, you are an amazing individual.  The world needs more people like you. You didn’t take him treasure hunting for the views or the likes. You did it because Braxton and his family were dealt a tough hand and this was a dream of his that you could help come true.  The fact that he impacted your life as much as you did his is just a testament to the kind heart that you have.  Take the time you need to grieve the loss of a friend, but then go kick some butt with two “t”s for Braxton.  I hope our paths cross some day just so I can shake your hand and thank you for being you.
Rip🥺
Yes, that was his wish Jake, and You fulfilled it for him. That is amazing! God has him in his arms now. He has no more pain, and he can treasure hunt all of the time if he wants to. I'm so sorry for you and everyone who loved him.
Rest In Peace buddy, long live Braxton❤️ You was a fighter into the very end
RIP Braxton. Jake just keep him in ur mind and heart.  And keep up the great job
We are here for brother Matt his little buddy big soul rest in paradise maybe my brother up there will take care of him my heart goes out to his family
This was emotional. Way to be a stand up dude. On another note, Braxton gave you a great saying you could use to raise money for a good cause. Kicking butt with 2 t's could be an awesome shirt!
Rest in

Amazing child with a gentle spirit. His Creator called him home. Braxton Did more for this world than anyone will ever imagine.
Well done, Jake. You sent him to heaven with an extra set of wings to get an already fantastic child to the NEXT portion of his life who you helped get a little less pain as you made him A LOT happier.   On to a place without pain but a whooole ton of Jake's flying around.
Rest in peace little angel. You picked the perfect role model to spend time with. I'm positive you two will see each other again. Kick that butt with 2 tees.
Im so sorry for Braxton

Braxton Buddy Rest in Peace Little Man you did well Fighting and I'm sure you are still staying strong and mighty from beyond the heavens searching for treasure's sending them down from the heavens to Jake , wishing you all the best to the family may god send you his love from the heavens.
I know this video isn't about Jake. But I really respect the fact that he's showing his emotions. Men are not made of stone. and it's stupid that it's kind of a taboo for men to open up and cry or vent  our emotions. Mad respect, I wish u all the best. Also my condolences to you and the family of this beautiful kid. R.I.P. Braxton hope you find al the treasures of the universe.
Jake pls awnser this it’s ok I feel u I loved the vid ❤️❤️❤️
Rest In Peace Braxton, you will be missed and you made a mark on so many lives❤️🙏

Sleep tight buddy ☹   Broke down reading he was going to be buried with the rock. Poor kid! I have a son and I don't know how I'd go on without him! He's my best friend and my world. Feel so sorry for this boys family and you too jake. What a sad time for all.
Rest in peace!! You have a huge heart and just remember you made his dream come true!!!
Lil dude rip my bro
Man…….
R.I.H young soul 😇
Hang on to the memory you made with Braxton. You changed that boys life and your selfless act affected him in more ways than you can imagine and obviously if affected you too. Until something of this magnitude happens to us we don’t realize how the smallest act can change a persons entire world. Be it a smile and wave at the store or an amazing treasure hunt. Your heart is genuine and so is your pain. It hurts to be there knowing what most likely will happen but it’s also amazing to be there knowing how impactful this was to him, his family, and yourself. Thanks for doing it.
rest in peace
Rest In Peace Braxton you will always be remembered especially by me because I lost my friend from cancer and it hurt really bad so Braxton I hope you Rest In Peace

:( sad 😢
you are a great guy keep your head up all happy memory's
My face when he started crying: 😧😧😖😖
To the Weidman family: I am sorry for your loss. I pray for your peace and comfort during this time of mourning. Braxton is no longer suffering and lived out his dream wish. Not many of us could say that. As a parent myself I can only imagine the pain you must be feeling. Take comfort in knowing that your treasure hunter has found the greatest treasure of all.  To Jake: Braxton chose you because you were his hero. You literally helped make his dream come true! Take comfort in knowing you helped a child find his most memorable,  intangible, and priceless treasure anyone could ever find.   RIP Braxton. RIP.
rip braxton he was strong fly high
He is in a better place. Rest In Peace 💫
Rest in peace little man 🙏
Jesus. I’ll never get it man. Why does God let things like this happen? I’ll never understand. Kid never hurt anyone, hell he barely had a chance to live. Probably didn’t even understand what was happening to him. I have a hard time with things like this. Why? That’s the ultimate question. We may never know the answer. We may never know why. I couldn’t imagine losing my son. No way. How would I go on? How could I live life without him here in it? I can’t begin to imagine the level of pain these people went through and are still going through. Nobody should ever have to feel that. I’m so sorry.
RIP Braxton ❤❤❤ fly high little man ...God bless you Jake your THE best!!!
This has me crying, fly high Braxton. :(

RIP
WOW ! Let me start off by saying that it's not like me at all to get emotional over a youtube video , not that I don't have a heart , just its easy to shut off emotion and just change the video at the swipe of a finger... But A KID??!  This is killing me! He didn't deserve this to happen, he hasn't even lived ! I have 3 girls that are younger then him and I can't even begin to imagine the feeling of losing one of them to cancer 💔.  But Braxton,  your my Hero for being tougher then any person I know, fighting cancer and not letting it get in the way of you living ! Heaven just got a new angel 😇 and God knows he's got a special one up there ! Rest easy little man! May your family be blessed with you watching over their shoulders .... you got your wings now, it's okay to fly and be at peace! God bless you and your family!! And everyone behind this channel and make a wish foundation for letting this happen and putting it together!!  To know that he will be buried with the crystal you gave him ........ it is making tears roll down my face uncontrollable... Rest In Peace little bro!
You are by far the most kindest and full hearted person that I love watching on here. You made his day the best ever and I am so happy for that! You're amazing, keep doing what you're doing <3 <3 <3

Rest in peace, Braxton. My condolences to his Family, and you as well, Jake! I don't know what it is like to lose a child, but I have lost a young Niece, who I loved like my own child, and that was devastating. Focus on the good times you had with Braxton, not his passing, and remember, he is not suffering anymore.

Hey Jake I'm not sure if you are really reading these but incase you are  My brother was a Make-A-Wish kid and after he was able to meet his wish he didn't stop smiling and was always talking about what they did.I say this because you said "I played only a small role for a short few days", but trust me you played a way bigger role than can be described. I hope this helps  at least a little. RIP Hank and Braxton Kick butt with two t's

Who can blame him for wanting to hang out with you, I’ve been watching your videos for years now!! Never once skipped through or not finished one!

Rip Braxton! My condolences and prayers from my family to yours. @DALLYMYD. Your a great person. Been following you for years now and just know he's pain free and you were an idol! Treasure that

We weep for a short time, but always remember that all of our Braxtons will be waiting for us with a toothy grin and a big hug, ready to show us around!
Rest In Peace braxton
You say he could have chose to do anything but jake you are an idol to many folks! You're videos got me into scuba diving and I'm sure many others but it's not just the treasure hunting it's the clearing up the rivers and the stuff you do for the community and the people around you ! RIP Braxton

I take 14 pills a day to keep me from having grand-mal seizures... but I lived.... Sooo sorry buddy, you deserved to of made it like me. Life just isn't fair.😔 When my dad was alive, he told me that brain tumors are a curse. To the Weidman family, stay strong.💪RIP Braxton.💯

Yes, you made an important impact on his short life but even more importantly he made a HUGE impact on YOURS and isn’t that all we can ask for in life…to make some kind of meaningful impact while we are here in earth?   I’d say he lived a great life…and achieved more than most.   Rest on peace Braxton.   Everyone who loved Braxton is in my heart and prayers for comfort and peace.
I wish I could take the place of this sweet boy. R.i.p sweet boy
Rest well sweet fighter.  Jake, thank you for taking the time to update us on this story.  To the family and friends of Braxton, there are no words to convey just how much he touched all of us watching his adventure. Our hearts are breaking with you. Prayers for all of you  I hope to live my life "kicking butt with 2 t's."  Thank you again for allowing us to know Braxton just a little bit.
Your a great man!

RIP Braxton! 🙏🏼🙏🏼 you did good by him bro. You were an amazing part of his life and he will always be a special person in your heart.
It is not said enough, that this world needs more good-hearted people like yourself and it is hard  knowing there are more kids everyday that won’t get that one-wish. I applaud all your time and effort that you give to this YT channel, ALWAYS ALWAYS smiling all the time, how contagious that is, you obviously already know… and of course the tears 😢 😭 are too. Much love to you Buddy

Love you Braxton. RIP
It takes a lot to break down and open yourself up to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people. You’re a real one and I was breaking down with you while I was eating my lunch. Cancer is awful and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I’ve been watching someone I work with slowly succumbing to it and it breaks my heart every day. You’re a real one, man, and Braxton couldn’t have chosen a better person to spend the day with. Rest In Peace, little guy.
Rest in piece Braxton! Fly high little guy. I'm sure your finding way better treasure up there!
So much respect for you the family an little braxton

Live long Braxton
The amount of emotion here made this so hard to watch. Love your content man. Prayers for the family and Jake. One thing I've always admired about this channel, not only is everyone good at smiling, they are good at putting smiles on people's faces. That is a gift few people have anymore, you did an amazing thing.
RIP Braxton
Be at peace Braxton xx it is hard, but remember you made the dreams of one strong and determined little solider come true!
Sorry my friend, you made his one wish come true your a good man keep your head up brother
Braxton's life may have been short  but you gave that kid and his family happiness in dark time and that is no small thing. You also have to remember he gave you something to a new outlook on life and that is no small thing either. He will always be hunting with you keep your head up brother.  Hunt in peace Braxton.
Braxton was one amazing kid. His family has also been amazingly, unbelievably strong through all this and all your efforts have made their lives better. Thanks again for being there yesterday and for having such a huge heart. #TeamBraxy
i wish i could go see dallmyd and jake and triston and just spend the day with him like braxton did i would love to do that for my birthday (it’s in may btw)
Braxton I know you're in a much better place finding treasures in much cooler places like Atlantis! Keep kicking butt with 2 "T" s! Love you buddy! To Braxtons parents, as a father I can't imagine the suffering you're going through. You are incredible and I hope I can be half the parent you two are. Stay strong and always hunt for treasure Braxton would want that.
Praying 🙏🏻 for Jesus to comfort in the loss of Braxton! I’m sorry.
Rip 😭🥺🕊💔🕊💔🕊
Rest In Peace Brax
What a blessing you were to Braxton! Bless your heart love 💗

I’m so sad to hear this. I’m so glad you were able to make his wish possible. This is just so unfair! No parent should out live their child! Sending lots of love to Braxton’s family and friends.
This was the most emotional video you have shared, I am so sorry for the loss. I am happy you gave him a great day. I wish I were not disabled and barely making it, I would make a big donation.

Rest in piece Braxton you will be missed
im so sorry for your loss a lot of people would not believe me but I know what its like 2 of my grand mas passed away only one day apart last year im so sorry
Love you Jake❤️
Aww,  So sad.  I am sorry.  I am really glad you got to spend some time with him and make him happy.
To DALLMYD my mom just passed away in January, she was going to be 84 this month. Although she had a fear of going under water she enjoyed watching your videos with me.  To the Weidman family - I read in a book that only time separates us from our loved ones.  Braxton is still here in the past. Being a Christian I believe that although they can't come to us, when God decides to call us home we can go to them through the accepted salvation of Christ. I hope this brings peace and comfort to all those impacted by the loss of your sweet boy Braxton.
It sucks for sure. You made his life brighter. Children should never have to suffer and go through these things. You are a great guy and will make an awesome dad one day
Rest in Peace Braxton, praying for his family.
respect respect respect that you can make a vedeo of somthing what so sad is loveeeee
How many have you lost to the beast know as Cancer. Donate. These folks need one last amazing adventure on Earth before they move on to enlightenment. I'll see you their Braxton. I hope.
Rest in peace little buddy.
Videos like this is hard to hit the thumbs up, prayers for his family and for you jake
Rest in Peace Angel Braxton, You did something so amazing for him, you blessed him with his wish. God Bless You and Your Family. Prayers..

So sorry for the loss of little Braxton 😢😞💔😔🙏😕
Noooooooooooooooooo😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔
I wish you peace and blessings. I cried with you, and you are a good guy. Don’t feel so hurt from it. We aren’t here for a long time. Sometimes a child leaves us so early but I know there is a purpose for everything, and he came here to touch your heart and many others. We are here to become closer to God, to be humane to each other. To stop and prevent evil from being done. Children are our teachers.
No jake pls tell me  this is not real 💔💔💔🥳😭😭rip little king you will be missed 💔👼👼👑

We’re all here for you Jake, he was a good kid and you made him smile so much. You did good and you couldn’t do anything else to help and that’s ok. He loved that day bro and just think about him watching you whilst you dive for treasure❤️
Rest in peace braxton! Keep searching for that treasure in the sky♥️
Rest In Peace Braxton
No words :( .
braxton lives on in our hearts rip little man ❤️ 🙏
Braxton you will be the legend of the season
❤️
❤️
Bro your videos are always so wholesome and they always touch my heart definitely my top 5 favorite youtubers
R.I.P BRAXTON  sending condolences to his family and jake you should feel proud that he chose you because what you do touches a lot of people especially the ones who like to treasure hunt that was his thing and you gave him that wish you gave him a reason to smile in his last days you brought happiness to his family to because they got to see him not suffer the pain if any they will remember him joyful for the time he spent with you and them god bless him and you ❤️🙏🏼
While Braxton might be gone, you'll always have the knowledge that this young man chose you, out of an entire world full of people, to spend the day w/, and this should let you know how much of a difference you make in the lives of other people.  Children are really intelligent and intuitive, a lot more so than we tend to give them credit for, and they know when adults are being genuine w/ them and when they're just placating them.  You obviously treated Braxton like a friend and an equal, and it gave him something to cherish, albeit for the short period of time he had remaining, which made it all the more special.  Taking part in the Make-A-Wish program should be an honor, and you made it seem so for Braxton, and your video really portrays this.  I think that you did an amazing job, and I'm glad that the two of you were able to spend that time together.
RIP Braxton and Rayan. Fly high
Fly high 🕊
Goes to show that you are a very good kind hearted person Jake.  Bless you and Bless Braxton. My Thoughts and Prayers are with all who Loved Braxton. ❤
RIP Braxton buddy 🥺🥺🕊❤️

Never underestimate the impact even the smallest gesture of kindness can mean to someone. Jake, thank you for sharing your adventures with complete strangers. I can only speak for myself, but I assume that many others would agree that what you do, not just the cool things you find, but the happiness you show and share and even just the simple trash pick-ups really brings a light to this world. The world could use some more of that. Keep on "kicking butt with two 'T's'."   Rest in peace Braxton.

Rest In Peace Braxton, I respect you for fulfilling his wish.  Also sssniperwolf sucks
rest in paradise Braxton
rest in peace lil legend
The word cancer is the heaviest word to ever leave our mouths. To say it with a child’s name attached is soul ripping. When I saw this vlog I skipped over it, twice. I knew it was gonna rip in to me so I passed over it. But then I came back to it because this little dude deserved all the respect for his courage and dignity and living his life as full as he could. My respect goes out to you too because it takes a lot of strength and courage to look into a child’s eyes knowing he’ll never grow up and live the life that every child should. To grow up, start a family, and retire after a life filled with love and adventure. In British Columbia we have a bear called a Kermode bear also known as a spirit bear. I’m giving one the honorary name Braxton. Kermode hugs to you and his family from Canader eh!
Jack think of happy times with him don’t let sadness take over
🙏🏽🙏🏽fly high lil guy 😔 wonderful job you made his wish and beyond more
Rip dude you're going to make me cry I just want to say the amazing content creator I love you dog love you channel love you content of course I want to hang out with you but I'm in Georgia having fun so rest in peace to him and love you man peace

That beautiful little boy left this earth surrounded by love, and knowing how many people loved him! The pain you feel shows that love. He's free now, from pain and all earthly bonds. And wherever he is he's happy. What an incredible gift to him but also clearly you, one person can change the world and that's obviously very true for Braxton! Big love 🤍🤍

R.I.P. Braxton
Rest In Peace Braxton
In my opinion is that you gave him the best day ever
Rest easy Braxton!  Such an amazing video and the video of him getting to live out his dream is priceless.
I am crying with you man. You helped him live his best moment. Thank you for letting his dream come true. We, we all are here for you. all 12.6 M of us. You need to talk? We will all listen. If Braxton was here, im sure he would say something along the lines of "So, how many subs do you have now?". Thank you for making a boys wish come true. God, the text, that broke me. I guess we all need a little cry sometimes.  Thank you.   Do not stand at my grave and weep, I am not there, I do not sleep. I am in a thousand winds that blow, I am the softly falling snow. I am the gentle showers of rain, I am the fields of ripening grain. I am in the morning hush, I am in the graceful rush Of beautiful birds in circling flight, I am the starshine of the night. I am in the flowers that bloom, I am in a quiet room. I am in the birds that sing, I am in each lovely thing. Do not stand at my grave and cry, I am not there. I do not die.
So sorry Jake just remember the good times you had with him and know he is always looking over you  and in your thoughts and heart
Our most sincere condolences and our prayers to the lord that he will give you peace and unconditional love. R.I.P. sweetheart,  you are now in paradise with Jesus and playing and frolicking with all your new friends 🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤oh god is so good 🌹🌹🌹🌹
Much R.E.S.P.E.C.T. to you bro! Keep on kicking buTT, all the best for the future. To Braxton, RIP😔😭 little hero may you fly high. And to his family, may God comfort you in this difficult time, my family's deepest condolences to you🙏🏼🙏🏼
You’re a good man, thanks for being a part of his joy!
RIP Braxton… I have a child that fought cancer… this melts my heart!!! Prayers to the family.
Rest peacefully in God’s loving arms, little guy! ❤️🙏🏼
Your awesome Jake… Rest In Paradise little Braxton … and keep diving on buddy 🙏🏽
I’m not religious but for his sake I hope heaven is real he deserved better
Roll Tide Braxton, Roll Tide.

Buried holding the crystal you gave him. That one broke me 😔
May little Braxton find all the treasure ever in his next life.  Rip little buddy💙💙💙.  #Kickinbuttwith2ts
Forever cherished and forever in our memories. You will live on through everyone. R.I.P Braxton.
I'm crying with you, bro. Rip. Only a kid :[
Rest In Peace Braxton. U fought a long and hard battle. 😢😢😢😢😢
Rest In Peace Braxton such a brave kid goin through that your a hero to everyone RIP Bro
My heart goes out to your family Braxton. Thank you for giving this brave fighter an amazing time. You not only gave him a good time and memory, but you gave his family something to hold onto forever. Thank you for that.   My mom passed away 11 years ago end of March from cancer. It was so hard, but I know she's not hurting anymore just like Mr. Braxton. Maybe he can show my mom some good treasure hunting spots.   Much love and support for you, Braxtons family, and make a wish foundation.
You have a heart of gold. ❤️
He's in a better place now
RIP.... Realist shit ive ever watched made me tear up he will watch you from the clouds man.
you're an awesome guy. he did not lose the battle he tied. I believe Norm Mcdonald is the first place I heard that. I agree he took the cancer out with him fighting all the way. may he rest in peace.
We gotcha bro. We're crying with you!! Rest In Peace Braxton.
Amazing !
There was a parade today for him 🙏
It's crazy how much a child can leave an impact on us unknowingly, to know how much we mean to other people is overwhelming, and you got to  experience that firsthand Jake. Know that it takes a special kind of person to do what you did for that kid. Therefore, you are a very special person that will no doubt take his spirit with you on your future adventures. That is special in itself, so take pride in that. Rest in peace Braxton, and good job on making his life that more exciting, even for just one day Jake. ❤
Jake, I hope your love and generosity inspires all your viewers! There are so many children in need and we all need to do our part to help! It’s heartbreaking to not know why he was taken so young but Braxton is in God’s loving arms now. I pray for peace for his family and friends.

Damn I have been wrapped up in my own emotional blackhole , this video touched softend my heart tho , RIP kiddo!
Saying goodbye isn't for us. But Instead, I will say that I look forward to seeing my friend again, each time I am reminded of him/her through a phrase, a joke, even an article of clothing. These are the things that will keep us close despite death. Love you jake keep being an amazing person.
I would definitely  trade  places  if it was my own  son Aiden. I  don't  like seeing  anyone  suffer from cancer  I lost my dad 9 years  ago from brain  and  lung cancer
Jake ...  Feel proud that you got to know such a precious little soul... He idealized you, and all the adventures you could go on... To Braxton's family, I'm very sorry that he lost his fight... Prayers for the family and friends, God's hand will be upon you in the help for healing the hurt you are feeling right now🙏🏼🙏🏼

That text message from his dad just BROKE me. That’s so sad. Rest In Peace Braxton 🕊
DALLMYD my boyfriend& I really appreciate and look up to you, look up too the bravery of that amazing, happy, loving, inspiring little boy, you inspire so many, make huge impacts on so many peoples lives, leave positive imprints, keep your chin up and keep doing what your doing. The fact your showing the world your tears and speaking from the bottom of your heart well doing so makes you such a down to earth, loyal, loving, amazing, brave human being! The things you do to make this earth a better place is awesome and there’s a lot of people including myself trying so hard everyday to accomplish things like you or other things that make little or big impacts on people, animals, the earth or just about anything❤️ Our condolences go out to Braxton’s family he was honestly one of the bravest, strongest amazing, loving little boys I’ve heard of, he was unfortunately taken way too soon, but he’s definitely left a positive impact on everyone he’s met or that’s watched him or been part of his life😇❤️ May Braxton forever rest in piece, you will always be remember little man xo

I never watched this channel before but rip Braxton.
Rest in Piece Braxton. It's crazy how someone can make a huge difference in a kids life.
Rest in peace. Braxton.  To his family no words can express my deepest  condolences for your loss of your son. Cancer sucks. Braxton will be watching over you and making sure you will be safe. #kickingbuttwith2ts

Fly high little.buddy Braxton, Jake it's awesome you got to be there with him while you could and make his wish come true always remember the good times you had with him. He has all the subscribers in the world now he is with our lord and savior 🙏
RIP Braxton.
God bless you Jake for making a sweet little boys wish come true. I know it had to be tough holding it together for him. Let's you know just how strong he was. ❤❤
kid was a big fighter had an amazing smile on his face when he saw u we all love you Braxton and hope you see this video up above you this absolutely broke my heart this one is for you we all love you until we see u again god bless u
Rest in Peace sweet Braxton! ❤ My God hold you so tightly in his arms and give comfort to family and friends!
As a father this got me in tears. Damn dude ur a great human for what you did. Sounds like u both learned from each other, Braxton rest in peace.
May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, Rest In Peace, Amen.   What an awesome thing you did for that boy and his family, just fantastic.
Suggestion, Braxton had a great motto Kick butt with two T's". Maybe create some t-shirts or hat with his motto on them. Sell them and donate proceeds to cancer research in his name. I would kick some cash in
U earned my respect, this is a tough video
Fly high Braxton
Praying you found your peace Braxton. Your memory will to continue to live on in the hearts and minds of all your new found friends. To the parents of Braxton, keep strong and hold your faith, do your best to live the life your son would want you to live.   And to anyone reading this message..  Go tell someone in your life that you love them, hug them when you can, and make every day special with them. You never know if that might be the last moment you get to make a lasting memory.
You know what man you cared enough to make a difference in not only that kids life but many others. Apart of that kid remembered. And you will always hold a piece of that kid and as you live on Braxton will live on. This comment will probably never matter but man you made a difference in that's kid's life and that is something inspirational! My heart goes to Braxton and his family. God bless you and Braxton and the family of Braxton. May Braxton's story inspire many!
I am sorry

I'm so sorry for your lost Jake 😢
Rest In Peace Braxton. I know how it feels to loose a loved one. I lost my grandpa 2 years ago and still hurts to this day. Stay strong 💪.
Do you realize, how much of an impression you made in his life, but also how much of an impression he made in yours? That was awesome how you helped make one of his dreams come true! He will be missed by all I am sure. He is finding new treasures now, and he isn't sick any longer. Be grateful for the time everyone had with him. I am sure you will never forget, Be blessed!
I remember watching this channel when it was nothing a young man much younger me I’m 33 and being captivated by your content then you got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and damn you were his hero good for you and all that you do
And fly high
Rip
R.I.P. lil man  hes treasure hunting in heaven now.
Jake you are the real treasure, above anything you find in your videos. And Braxton realized this more than anyone. I cried watching this and I had literally no connection or knowledge toward the situation and it’s because I was so moved by how sincere you were. Most influencers have Fans…. You have FRIENDS. And that’s truly amazing. Braxton was so lucky to be able to experience his true dream, something most people can’t say even after 80 years of living.  You helped him live that dream.   You are truly a gift from God, man. You really are. Thank you for everything you do for your fans, your friends, your family, and the world as a whole. You inspire me to make a change.
That is so sad 😭.I feel so sad.jake you are such a great person for making this.Rest in peace Braxon.
👊🏻🐽🤠
Rest In Peace Braxton 🙏

Rest In Peace little man. Jake, many guys like you who make a great living on this platform use it for the wrong reasons. You do great things. Don’t ever stop. You are a good man. If the world was only full of guys like you. What a different place this would be.
Love you braxton
Rip
Weidman family, I am so sorry for your loss! Praying for you and your family. For peace and comfort, to find joy in the midst of loss. This song helped me through a recent family loss, maybe it will for you as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eus8LvZDRpQ
Rest In Peace love and prayers for you and the widemen fam
Rest in Peace Braxton you Will be remembered forever ❤️
Jake, Thank you for doing this. Making Braxton's wish come true. Checking in on this family. Meeting with Braxton before he passed since you were close enough to visit. Making this hard video letting us know. Donating the money for this video to them. You are a good man and this is a huge part of why we love to support you.
These experiences have to be the hardest but most inspiring times you face while being a “YouTuber”. I feel like a lot of people fail to realize how much responsibilities and impact you have on your viewers, especially when you have to explain what you do for a living. I don’t think people realize just how much your efforts mean to some people, nor will they understand often. Thank you for being a light in the dark times for some people who watch your videos for a break from their reality. You wear that weight of expectation on your shoulders, and you do it well. Just like you left an impression on Braxton through your videos and time you spent with him, he has left a major impression on you as well. I hope you take this as pure inspiration to continue doing what you love. Peace and love my man.
sending prayers to Braxtons family, stay strong buddy.
Rest in peace 😭 Braxton😔

Rest in peace buddy
Hi Jake,  I’m from Birmingham UK- I’ve been watching your channel for a few years now, I love your enthusiasm and the warm, wholesome nature you carry through the screen. Finding people’s belongings and returning them to the owners where possible for free gives a really attractive feel good draw to your content. It’s no wonder you became a hero to Braxton, he obviously looked up to you and was stoked on your adventures like many millions of us DALLMYD fans and subscribers are. You can definitely hold his memory high in your heart, I send my thoughts to Brixton’s family, to you and your family and friends. You have done a truly great thing in this young boy’s life that you can be proud of all your life.   Best wishes from Paul
You had a big impact on his life you made hi wish come true God got him now he's ok and not suffering rest in heaven  lil man praying 🙏 for the family

Rest in Peace  Braxton bud yall be missed, also you are loved from all over the world and also Jake I know you miss but the thing is that he is not fighting in pain. Also you did nothing to him all you did was made his wish come true and make him happy which you did so, so  he was happy, but you can not control what the tumor does. Braxton will always have a peace of you and a memory of you and so will you " the crystals " .
Rest in peace Braxton and much love the the Wiedman family. 💙

Hi Jake, there are no words........ Rest in Peace Braxton, hopefully he will be treasure hunting in Heaven . My condolences to the family. I have a son Freddie who is 12 and already full time in a wheelchair. He has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy which is a life limiting disease. Like Braxton he is full of joy and loves everybody. Lots of our friends plan good things for him and all we can do in this world is as much as possible to make him happy before its time to say goodbye. Jake, you are a wonderful person and you made a difference to Braxton's life and that my friend is a wonderful thing. You are one of the most down to earth youtubers and I am sure you will go on to do special things. Lots of Love, Ady, Carmen and Freddie [ and the mad sausage dog, Chilli woof]
My whole heart is with u and the wideman family💙
I watched the treasure hunt with Braxton and it was excellent  fun, lovely heartfilly..and 2 watch this one..Jake think of it this way you made his day, his wish come true and think of the joy you brought to him just a day for you meant a life Time of joy for that little Angel 😇...God bless you Jake and I'm sure Braxton is treasure hunting in heaven ❤ 💙..

RIP Braxton  you was a shooting star 🌠.  You will be greatly missed by so many. You touched so many peoples hearts 💕.
It's so sad when a child passes away from such a terrible disease it's an absolute tragedy. To Braxton's family I'm so very sorry for your loss I know the pain must be unbearable. Also to you the maker of this video it's obvious this affected you greatly by your show of emotions, keep in mind you made that little boys day. Also everyone remember although it's tragic and very sad that he's gone, he's an angel now safe from all harm. Love and positivity goes out to all affected by this and brighter days come to you all.
Your a great guy, keep inspiring people man. Much love ❤️ you impacted him in an amazing way.
The angels above gained another, rip braxton fly high❤️ 👼
Rest In Peace little buddy... I'm glad to see some real emotion in this video cus i truly think you cared which is so nice to see!  Seriously this was hard to watch as someone who makes a living working with children... I couldn't imagine how I'd feel if one of my kiddos passed away...  Again... RIP Little man! You made me smile so hard :) thank you for that!
That Braxton spirit will be with you every time you go out for treasure hunting no child should have to go through that and have there life take to soon rest in peace little man rest in peace.
Rest in Peace❤️🕊

And I think you're an awesome man in general a lot of people look up to you my friend and yeah Braxton could have chose anything else but I always believed not every person wants to go to Disneyland to be remembered or stuff like that it's just the simple things in life that you do everyday that mean the world to some people that can't do those everyday things because I like to think of it this way not every person gets to experience in everyday life or the little things you do in life that you may not think about but if some people who can't do those everyday things it means the world to them rest in peace Braxton 🙏🙏🙏🙏
fly high young braxton
Rip braxton he is in a better place now:((( that happy kid.
OMG,  My Heart goes out to Braxton family. R.I.P. little man. You are with the Angels and with God now and we look after you in heaven my prayers are with your family. From me and my family in Bourne Lincolnshire England UK
Jake just remember hes in a better place now, he's no longer in pain. Youre a sweetheart jake and we all love you for that. And as for the family, we love you and you are amazing parents. We love you and your son or sibling is watching over you and is able to watch his family grow and is not in pain. Rest in piece ❤❤❤
I've been watching Dallmyd for a long time and this video definitely hits the heart with me because I have a nephew roughly around the same age as Braxton and I cannot bear to imagine losing him my condolences to his family and may Braxton rest in peace and with God
That's is so sweet of you to have his back after all that you and him as Ben through
He's in such a better place now instead of being on this planet, and I'm pretty sure he's waiting for you somewhere out there
You dont have to feel bad or apologize for crying man. You make this kids life amazing. Its sad hes gone but its amazing seeing the other half of these make a wish foundations, i feel like alot of celebrities probably happens more often to them than we think but they never talk about these. Its very humanizing. I love everything you do man. Keep up the great work and keep changing lives.
😢
Rest in peace Braxton I send my love to the family is there any like go fund me page or something

"Kickin' Butt WITH 2 T's"  😎👍That would be an awesome t-shirt to honor Braxton & his family with. Hopefully some1 could come up with a design & logo for something like that so it could be included in the fundraiser. I would definitely buy at least a few myself. 🙏Thank you for sharing this whole story & experience. I'll always remember this💎🙏😇✌️
RIP Braxton you will be missed buddy
Rest easy Braxton 🙏 condolences to all the loved ones

Rest In Peace, Braxton. Prayers 🙏
RIP Braxton! ❤️🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽❤️
Hey maybe you could have shirts printed with that “kickin butt with 2 Ts”  and sell them and give the proceeds to the family or to the children cancer society in Braxton nane
Look. If you believe in any type of God, you have to know that when your kid dies of some weird or messed-up childhood illness or disease, that's just God's way of saying, "Hey, I'm sorry. I kind of messed up on this one. Let me take that back and give you the option of living your life happier without this burden weighing on your shoulders." Seriously, these parents are better off without this little money pit running around. If they have other kids, they can now afford to take them to Six Flags or Disney World. There's always a brighter side to things...😄
The joy he has i will try to achieve. A true role model. Rip buddy
😓😪😭😢
Sad to hear Jake and condolences to Braxton's family.... rest in peace little treasure hunter
Rest in peace Braxton
It's so messed up. One day your treasure hunting with your idle, and the next your gone.

thats tuff i know how it feels to lose some one to cancer

Jake, you are the best prison on this planet, you had a 1 and 1 million chance to meet this young man and for him to chose you you should be honerd that he chose you,  so don't tear yourself up, and just think how happy he was doing that with you.
wow... rest in paradise Braxton.
RIP King 👑
R.I.P Braxton 😢
How much this touched my heart. I felt your pain. God bless you and Rest in Heaven Braxton.🙏😢
I can never imagine the pain for both the family and you. You made a big impact on his life and plenty of other kids and even the adults that watch your content. It is sad to hear or see a loved one go.   R.I.P Braxton. You can go find all the treasure you want in heaven now.
Cancer truly is one of the worst things that exist.  Hopefully with time we can eventually find a way to prevent or cure it, so that tragedies like this won't have to happen anymore.  I'm sorry you and his family had to see this child pass like that.  It's probably the hardest thing to watch in life.
Rest in peace braxton your a tough kid
What a sweet little spirit… I’m sure his presence will be missed greatly!!  I’m sorry for your pain & especially his family… as a mom this is your worst fear, I can’t imagine their heartbreak!  RIP Braxton!!!!!! ❤️🙏🏻
Rest in Peace Braxton
Rest In Peace Braxton
:(
Rest In Peace , young man 🙏🏻
Rip Braxton.. u fought hard.😢
I'm so sorry for you and the family's loss. I understand what your going through. I watched my cousin lose his battle to a tumor in his lungs when he was only 2. His story will live on as all of us "kick butt with two Ts". Thank you for sharing his incredible story. Rest in peace little man. I hope I can meet you up in heaven one day. ❤️
The one thing I really hope you take away from all this jake. The difference Braxton made in your life I can say you made the same impact in his and many others, you were able to give with pure generosity to a young man in need. I hope you take that as one of your biggest achievements, forget views, follows, subs likes, you made a little mans life as complete as possible. Bless you all.
I’m so sorry
Rest in peace Braxton fly high and look for treasure up in heaven with the angels
RIP BRAXTON. Strong kid.

Rip buddy!
If Braxton family reads this I want you to know your young man made a large impact on many people through these videos and you should be SO proud! Thank you DALLMYD so much for being such a kind soul
I’m so sorry for your loss. He sure had smiles from ear to ear. God bless you and praying for you and his family. Sending hugs too
Rest In Peace Braxton, Fly High
OMG I’m so sorry for u and him😭😭😖😟😕😢😣😔😔…RIP
Rip Young b  Jake u did a very good thing by helping that kid I bet he is smiling down from heaven at u
It's so devastating when you lose a loved one but for it to be a little kid man it breaks your heart and soul he's a little baby in the context of life and he had so much to live for which makes it even more difficult to accept my most heartfelt condolences go to that family and I really hope everyone raises hundreds of thousands of dollars for these parents
Rest In Peace and it is sad he had to leave the world at a young age and I have to say to all people that donate to the programs for kids keep doing it  because the thing is that you need to give them there last wish’s or give them the energy to keep going on
R.I.P Braxton the coolest kid
RIP
Rest in peace braxton
Rest in piece
Rip we will be there for you we love 💘

Rest In Peace little buddy. And thanks make a wish for hooking him up with one of the most wholesome YouTubers 💛
Jake I heard about this young man recently when i made a FB post about my husband and a friend commented. Your sadness is consuming me i feel the pain you are experiencing, not because i lost a child, but my husband age 54 to GBM as well. He fought 14 months but ultimately passed March 2020. This disease is a monster and i can feel their pain. Hugs to Braxtons family whom I know are devastated. It’s difficult to move on,..but moving forward will come with time. ♥️
Rest In Peace little man
Rip little buddy🙏
Rest in peace Braxton
You have a heart of gold. Anyone would enjoy hanging out with you! Braxton was a tough young man and showing his Crystal to God telling him all of his stories. Time with others in need is always a blessing. It makes their time in life worth it.
Rest in peace Braxton he will always be remembered no matter what
Jake, you made a difference.  Bless you.  Rest in Peace Braxton.  Hugs to your family.
RIP Braxton 🙏
You’re an inspiration to us all Braxton! Thank you for doing what you do Jake and bringing a little light to that kids life!
I’m so sorry this has happened I know first hand what it’s like when your relative has cancer because my uncle had a brain tumour, my moms friends husband who I was rly close to has passed away, and I know a lot more people who I’m close to who have cancer, but I should stop making this comment about myself, and give Braxton a Rest In Peace…😔✌️

😥😥😥😭😭😭😭😖😭🤧🤧 he don’t deserve that 😭😭
RIP Braxton. I am so pleased you got to make his wish come true. You are an incredible person Jake.
🥰you are so awesome I am glad I am a sub
To the parents of that precious little boy… I am praying for you! I can’t imagine the pain you are going through. Know your son’s life is changing lives as we speak. Stay strong, keep your faith, you will see him again!!
You brought so much joy to him in a hard time of his life. I know it's hard to see him go. But it was time for him to rest and stop hurting. ❤
this hit me hard because my names braxton and this kid had the same wish as me
That video will be something his family and friends will have to remember Braxton. Great job Jake!
I have nothing to make you feel better but I can promise he in a better place. When I was 7 or 8 my uncle passed and that was the saddest days of my life but there is no reason to be sad. He had a good life and crying won't bring him back. I had to learn this. I get it he had a special place in your heart just like my uncle but the lord helped me
RIP Braxton god bless him and his family.. I am very young and only have 3 dollars so I'm going to give that to the donation place  (I forgot what it was called) but good luck to  Braxton's family.. I ain't trying to make this about me but my brothers kid died before being born I know how it feels god bless Braxton's family recover soon
Rip- braxton
So sorry jake
Rest In Peace Braxton you will be remembered forever I love watching your treasure hunt

Both of you are such sweet souls.  😭 RIP Braxton
Poor kid, he is so young but he is in a better place now. What happened will be hard on everyone. I hope the best for his family members/friends. Just to see the emotion on Jake's face made me tear up. I truly hop the best for everyone.
RIP 😭😭😭😭
Jake, you are one of the most amazing human beings. I want to thank you for so many things; the work you do cleaning up our rivers, lakes, and oceans, the message you spread of caring about our waterways and planet, the kindness that you show to everyone, but, most especially, the incredibly caring soul that you are. As the parent of a 2 time cancer survivor ( she fought Burkitts Lymphoma and Burkitts Leukemia and WON), I can tell you, without a doubt, that what you did for him did so much more for his heart and his family than any doctor or surgery or drug could ever have done. You literally took away his pain, suffering, and fear, even if only briefly. You gave him life back, even if it was only for a short time. You gave his family happy memories, of his last days, when otherwise they might not have been. They received so much comfort, and this will continue, from seeing him happy and smiling during an otherwise horrible time, and they will carry those Happy memories with them eternally. YOU are a Good Man, in a world where those are few and far between, please take comfort in that. And, Thank You, from the bottom of my heart, for all that you do. Stay safe and be at peace.
Fly high my little angel your in a better place and your perfectly healthy now good luck Braxton
God bless you for making this young man's wish come true.
WHOS chopping onions!   Doing Gods work Jake. God bless my dude.
Rest In Peace we love you Braxton I’m sorry so so sorry for you jake

RIP Braxton. Jake your amazing dude/Content Creator keep doing what your doing. You are changing lives.
Fly high my dude❤️
God bless you Braxton, may we all see you in haven little man
Fly high❤
Oh my momma heart 😭 rest in peace sweet little man 🙏
I don’t usually comment on things like this because my relationship with death is a lot different than most people, but idk if these words may comfort someone. I’ve lost a lot of close people to cancer and I’ve learned to cope in a lot of ways. When people say someone “loses” to cancer it makes it sound darker than it already feels sometime so I learned to say they made a truce with the cancer. His body and the cancer decided neither could fight anymore and came to a truce. He was a strong young man and to say he lost just simply isn’t true. You can’t lose when you’ve fair as hard as someone like this young man. Rest In Peace Braxton. Sending love to the family and friends
As Father this very heartbreaking video to watch,made me cry! Fly high little angel Braxton.
RIP braxton 💔
Very touching. Whenever you can touch someone’s life the way you did, there is nothing but love. Rest easy little buddy.
Rest peacefully sweet Braxton
R.I.P. BRAXTON he will forerver stay in our hearts

My man if you cry it’s ok we won’t make fun of you also rip Braxton
I am so sorry for your loss and the families loss. I can’t imagine what it must be like to lose a child and I pray that I never have to. Thank you for making his wish come true! I’m sure he’s going to continue watching you and his family from above. My thoughts and prayers go to you all.
Rest In Peace Braxton
It will be over soon I promise I was going through the same thing and now I try not to think about it it will be over soon I promise R.I.P love you fly high into the gates of heaven
God bless this young boy. Welcome him into your loving arms and make his place in your kingdom. And bless you for giving this incredible young man his dream a chance to happen. Know in your heart he is beyond the pain of his disease. And is whole again by God's eternal grace and power.
❤️💔

Oh

Jake I admittedly don’t watch all your videos. I did subscribe a couple years ago after watching a few of your videos simply because I realized what a genuine and good person you are. You made Braxton’s life better and in turn he made your life better.  Keep doing what you’re doing brother. The world needs many more like yourself and Braxton.
You did everything you could have done, and don’t forget that, just know that a really long time from now, he’ll be looking forward to that next treasure hunt. Fly high buddy🕊
RIP little man
Rest easy Braxton
im so sorry

You never know what God calls you to do. Have comfort knowing Braxton is no longer in pain. Even the bravest warriors deserve a rest, and he certainly was one.
Jake you are an awesome person for doing this. You have a heart which seems most YouTubers don’t, but you do and you changed Braxtons life for the good therefore you are the best human for doing and your heart is made of gold

I actually watched that video pretty recently. I thought it was the sweetest thing to take him on a treasure hunt. Every kids dream come true.  Kids recognize good in people. He saw you. He chose you. He'll be with you always.   To the family, my deepest and most sincere condolences.  I just lost my mom to small cell brain cancer just a few months ago, but losing a kid is absolutely gut-wrenching. My prayers and love with you all. 🙏
Rip braxton
My thoughts and prayers are with you and his family and friends....you did such a great job with his wish...loved that video! Take care....

Jake, thank you for making Braxton’s biggest wish come true! You were one of his greatest idols and a wonderful friend to him! I know the kindness and friendship you showed Braxton blessed his family too! I never got to meet Braxton but followed him on social media during his battle with his illness and prayed hard. He left a huge imprint on my heart that will never leave me. He was such a loving, positive, strong, funny guy with the biggest heart!  Your presence in Braxton’s life meant the world to him and all who love him. God bless you!

By the way I didn’t mean Braxton should’ve died I’m saying the guy just said he just said as a Fortnite player he’s being mean to me because the game I play I should die
I don’t mean to do this on this video but everybody start being mean VSC in the comments because it what he said to me was terrible he said as a Fortnite player you should’ve been taken away from the world instead of Braxton
Rest In Peace Braxton. Jake- don’t be surprised about kids want to treasure hunt with you man my kids are the ones that found your videos and I know I can trust what you put on you’re a great person man keep on keepin on

Hey Brother my buddy and I are veterans and we do road marchs for fallen military, law enforcement, firefighters, and first responders. We fold a flag and carry it on our road march and we log our miles for the person we are honoring. These videos of Braxton pulled at my heart string and I'm going to dedicate a flag to him and I want to give it to his family. After I get finished with the miles and I will get in touch with you. I'll keep you updated.
Rest in peace Braxton ....
You're a solid human being Dally.  He's not in pain anymore my man. This is an example that all of us can take time to really become part of someone else's story. We tend to focus on our path in life and where we want to go, without realizing that other people are living their stories right next to us.  Become a solid supporting character for someone else.  Lift them up and let them be the hero in their own story.
You are an incredible person for making that child's wish come true. And the fact that you kept following up and visiting, staying in touch. You and Braxton are allstars. Thoughts to you and Braxton's family.
Dude let those tears flow. Don't hold it in. You made Braxton so happy and he had the time of his life. You gained a guardian angel that will be on every treasure hunt from here on out.
Rest in peace Braxton love you
Rip little boy🙏🏻
Rest In Peace Braxton. We will miss you 💗

RIP Braxton. That you stayed in touch with him Jake is what makes all the difference to him. I'm heart broken for his family and you. God bless you.
Hold your head up champ. He did do exactly what he wanted to do. You weren’t just “anything”, you got to be his everything. You do great work both inside and outside the water.
Rest In Peace Braxton
That is asome
I'm so sorry for your loss! You made a HUGE impact in his life. RIP 🕊️
we love you braxton
R.I.P Braxton, it must be sad that he couldn't achieve what he wanted. He could have had a degree, get married and have kids. So sad to see him go so soon. You will be missed
You made his wish come true and Braxton and his family wont ever forget it. I am grateful I got to meet him. Your a hero Jake.
Fly high Braxton sending love to your family ❤️❤️❤️ xxx
I’m sobbing 😭 You were literally this child’s Earth Angel, what an honor! Just imagine had you not started your channel or followed your heart  ❤️ God bless you, Braxton and his family xo.
I am sorry that this happened, and you and your subscribers will always be with you for ever more. We love you, and hope you feel better.  -Haiden
I’m so happy that you gave him the one thing he wanted
Bless Braxton. Love that saying - Jake - you def need to use that every day to honor him. The reason he wanted his Wish to be you Jake - is because you inspire people with your kindness, heart and generosity and more! Shows he was a special kid. He saw a kindred spirit in you and to see you as his role model and Wish come true..............is because of you and your work. That kid knew. Rest well and in peace now Braxton.
You did a great thing. I'm sure it was a highlight of his life. RIP
Rest In Peace buddy, God be with the family. ♥️ what a blessing you were.
I’m legit crying so hard
Rip

R.I.P.Braxton condolanses to the family.Such sad news, he will be doing his treasure hunting  amongst the stars. Jake thanks for the update, god man you made me cry when you started. You are a cool dude not many would put a video up like you have. Keep up the good work Braxton will be with you everytime you put on that dive suit, he will be watching over you . God bless my friend from here in Kent in the UK.
You did such an amazing thing for that little boy. Watching the video of Braxton's treasure hunt and seeing how much his face lit up every time he found a treasure, and how much he enjoyed spending the day with you... You are an amazing human and I hope you always remember the impact you had on Braxton's life and the impact he had on yours. Keep your chin up, and keep being your best self.
Jake I'm crying with you as I watch this. R. I. P. Braxton

I loved the video when it came out. You're a great person, Jake. You made Braxton's day with his treasure hunt. R.I.P. Braxton. Prayers for his family.
I literally can’t count how many times I teared up in both videos that’s just to sad he was way to young. Rest In Peace Braxton and I hope and pray your in a better place doing a lot better 🙏
You made me cry
You young YouTubers have such an incredible impact on young peoples lives. For you Jake, this was a small thing to do. But for him it was huge. Never forget the smile you put on his little face. He's pain free and back home with our father in heaven. God bless you and all that you did for Braxton, and continue to do with your films ❣️🙏
Rip Braxton

CBG from hemp shrinks tumors, for future reference. It's in the pubmed.
rip buddy I know how it feels when my guinea pig died just absolutely terrible. I may just look like a useless comment on the internet that is just saying rip for this sweet kid who should never have to go through that but I am truly sad for this kids family and someone should make a go fund me for funeral fees for him. And at least he got his biggest dream come true before he had to pass away. It is not your fault jake that this child is deceased now so don't make it feel like that. We just have to move on and focus on how good he was while he lasted from the bottom of my heart R.I.P for this sweet soul.
Rest in paece
this has broken my heart rip braxton 💜💜
my heart is so broken! This one was tough to watch. Thank you for making this video and I hope the family feels an overwhelming of love and support from God, the Youtube community, family and friends.   Life isn't perfect, and this boy died way too soon. But I hope that the short life he lived, will have a positive impact on those who knew him, and found out about him through these videos.
Rip best to his family and friends
I’m am so sorry to hear this devastating news. Rest In Peace Braxton❤️❤️❤️We will never forget you
You have a huge heart, Braxton and you. It’s amazing the impact they think you have on them, but little do they know how much we adore them too. So sorry for everyone’s loss. 💕

being a brain tumor survivor myself and having our lives change as it progresses, you spending time with Braxton and treating him as a normal kid means the world. as little of a gesture as you think it was, its huge to him. donating your time is everything. Keep being awesome Jake!!

Rip Braxton❤️
Prayers to sweet Braxtons family!
Rest In Peace he’s treasure hunting with God now❤️
R.I.P.
Rest in peace Braxton
This sucks. Kids shouldn't have to die so early. They all deserve to have at least a taste of adult life. We'll remember you, Braxton. I hope that if some other kid wants to spend time with you as part of a Wish, that you'll still do it even though there is a risk of them leaving so soon.
RIP
💔💔💔💔💔💔🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😮😮😮😭😭😭😭😭😭😣😣😣😣😣😫😫😫😫😫😫
Rest In Peace 😥😢
RIP Braxton 😥      Youre a great guy, thanks for taking the time for him and being there.   👍
You said you’re happy you got to make a little impact on his life, but I think he made a bigger impact on yours.! Gotta treasure the kids man. Too pure hearted. Rest In Peace Braxton.
R.I.P Braxton :'(
What a precious boy. Loved watching his day of treasure hunting! Love and prayers for his family. 🙏❤
And now Braxton is forever a part of your channel. His dreams came true. I just hope the rest of us who are left can learn to live a life that full. RIP, big man.

Brax if you see my dog Jed up there I would be honored if you threw a ball around for him.  He would be in good hands. Rest In Peace.
GOD only takes the ones he needs. Fly hight little man. ( R .I .P )
<33
I'm crying just because no reason on earth Heaven needs a child.   I've been to exactly one child funeral.  She was 9yo.  No parent should ever ever ever have to bury a child.
Prayers to Braxtons Family. Rest In Peace little man! So sad  😔
Much love to you I'm happy to have donated to Braxtons great family! RIP angel xo
RIP Braxton and blessings to his family :(
May braxton rest in peace, he truly was a fighter, and great job helping him with his last wish jake you done him and his family proud
For Brazton, RIP brother. Although your time on Earth was short your influence was mighty.
❤️❤️
Braxton I didn't had the honor of meeting you but I know you were a really good person fly high and I hope you find peace
Jake I'm the director of an Industrial Arts program that works with kids that are undergoing cancer treatment.  This doesn't get easier, but none of us have any guarantees of the amount of time we have on this earth.  What we can do is love and support each other while we're here; what you did for this guy made his whole year.  Love your heart and positivity, God bless and stay safe.
I feel this more than ever right now Jake. I just lost my little brother to Aplastic Anemia 2 weeks ago. While he wasn't as young, he was still just 20. I have no doubt you looked at Braxton as a little brother. He seemed like a great kid. Rest easy Braxton.
Rest in peace Braxton
Rip
Rip Braxton 🙏 🕊
❤
Rest in peace braxton. fly high🕊️🕊️
The man up stairs only takes the ones he needs. Fly high little man. Watch over all of us.
As one who lost several friends to cancer as well as many family members I know how hard it hits and how the recovery is never complete. I was also granted a wish in 1993 as I was dying from Lupus damaged liver disease and my wish was to see my grandparents who could not afford to come see me, I can tell you how wonderful the organization is. Thankfully I got a new liver just in time.
I'm so sorry for your loss.  Rest In Peace Braxton.  Thank you for making this kid's day. You are a good man
Amazing. Thank you for sharing his legacy.
Rest in peace
Rip Braxton, you will be remembered
😟Yeah it's really sad we don't all get born with good health. This reminds me of when my mom asked me how the first day of 2nd grade went. I told her it was fine but that I didn't see my friend on the school bus from last year. She then had to tell me that he had been sick and had passed away over the school break. Anyway.. condolences to Braxton's friends and family. RIP
Braxton did not lose his battle. I consider it a stalemate. The little king fought so hard. Rest In Peace Braxton’
God bless him and his family.
My heart goes out to you and his family. So young to be fighting that hard for his life. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Much love 😘
R.i.p littleone  😭💔
Rest in peace 😔
Dam bro really. You got me all messed up bro. May God be with his family
Rest in heaven sweet boy. ❤️ Jake you should be proud of the impact you have on your subscribers & beyond. I have to say it, f cancer!
❤️
R.I.P
whos chopping onions :(
Rest in peace braxton 🙏
God bless you it is very nice of you For someone that much
You gave a child a day he could live a lifetime on. I admire you for giving him probably the greatest day of his to short life. Respect to you and may he rest in piece.
cancer is a horrible decease for any one to deal with but kids don't deserve to go through that. People are trying to find cures to basically eradicate cancer but if a complete eradication doesn't come I hope all the cancers that kids can get will be eradicated because a kid is just suppose to play and enjoy life not be stuck in a hospital or at home fighting cancer or any other incurable deadly decease.
Jake, You made little braxton have one amazing day doing exactly what he wished, spending time with his hero on the river finding treasure and making him a YouTube star ⭐️ he was a true natural and I’m stoked that you made him have a fantastic time!  Rest in peace Braxton.  Wishing all his family love in this horrible time and jake keep doing what your doing your an inspiration to many people and we love you for how genuine you are.
RIP Braxton you are flying high and enjoy life with no pain.
Smile big brother you're the change in the world most of us dream we could be. Do well and doubt not
One of the most heartbreaking video's I've seen in a while! I like how you aren't afraid to show who you really are! Little Braxton is in a place where there's lots of treasure and kind spirits!

Rip
Rest in Peace Braxton!!! Jake, when I heard your comment regarding Braxtons choice of saying "kicking butt with two T's" I chuckled because I instantly thought of an innocent child who isnt allowed to cuss and is mindful of his parents so he chose saying two T's as a way to distinguish between but and butt and not cuss!!! Genius!!!
im sorry bro im so so so sorry
Если здесь есть русские, то переведите пожалуйста, что случилось 🙏🏼
❤️🇧🇻
Definately touched my heart 🥺 I'm crying just as much especially with the text that said that he would be buried holding the crystal you gave him. Rest in peace young man ❤
Rip Braxton. Wow real emotional video. Thanks For granting his wish. Dope
Rest in peace.
Jake, I can see how much making this video hurt. Just know that you were like an angel on earth to little Braxton on his day out with you. My prayers are with his family and also with you. Keep on being the wonderful soul you are!
For Braxton ❤️
DON'T CRY BRO ITS  LIFE
So glad his wish to spend a day with you!
That is so sad I am sorry he died
He was such a big kind heart. May he rest in peace. i just love how he was just so thankful. May he stay with God. Love you Braxton.
Jake you TRUELY are a special person. I'm very sad for your loss and the Weidman family's loss. Such a terrible loss. Keep your head up Jake and keep doing what you do!!!
I see a lot of inflammatory things on the internet, Jake you are the one thing on here that NEVER fails to make me smile...until you made me cry. You're a positive force for all of us who tune in, especially Braxton and that's what makes you special. Glad to be part of your community and yes this is a community of people who love seeing good be done 🙌🙏

Thank you for sharing this update. May the Lord comfort this family, and everyone who he had an impact upon. It was so neat to watch the treasure hunt that you did with him. Thank you for making his wish come true.

Thank you Jake. I needed inspiration. I lost my life less then a month ago. My wife passed away. Age 37. Both so young. Lots of tears the smorning. Once again thank you 😊 🙏
You will be missed Braxton ❤️
Love you brother. I admire your great emotions. Res in peace little buddy ❤️
RIP Braxton. So sorry for your loss.
Salve mi dispiace tantissimo 💔riposa in pace piccola stella⭐️
Prayers of comfort for his family 💖🙏
Keep your head up he is looking down on you making sure you are okay because of what you did for him 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Rest in peace braxton. ❤❤❤❤ Love and care to the family.  Jake you were so kind to make that boys dream come true. Any kid would love to meet there fav youtuber but I think braxton truly deserved it.  Note to the family: sorry for your loss and sending love ❤ from me. Keep going. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤   I teard up so much during this video. Sending love from England   Freya. Xox
DALLMYD what you did was honestly the kindest thing I think i have ever seen. You lit up Braxtons face like he just went treasure hunting and found the best treasure out of all treasures. And he found you. Keep this kid in your wide heart and im sure you'll never forget him. None of us will. Rest in peace Braxton. And may we all live life kicking but with 2 t's. To the Weidmans: I know loosing someone you love is one of the worst things you will ever have to go through. Especially as it was the king Braxton himself. But just know you did every thing you ever could to help him. The support you gave him was knight worthy. I'm sure he loved you immeasurably because of it.  Till the next time we see him. Rest in peace braxton.
Rip brax fly high lil buddy

Another beautiful angel got his wings
Tragic loss my condolences to the family

You know it is very sad when a child passes away from an illness a disease. Cancer itself is a horrible horrible horrible illness to have. There are some children that are able to fight it and get through it and it's great. But for those who don't make it their families left the hole in her heart. That sometimes can and can't be repaired. The people that knew that child are going to miss him terribly. And they're left with this emptiness. And sometimes like I said it could be repaired. Sometimes those family members just get so depressed afterwards. But they forget who their child was I forget who they are. They have to try to live on in his memory. And they have to keep him alive in theirs. But the cool thing is. He's not in any more pain he's not suffering he's in heaven God's got him. And he's got a brand-new bodies got his little angel wings and he'll be fine. He's just watching over his family now washing over his friends. Waiting for them. Waiting for God to call them home. God takes people from us no Rhyme or Reason he just takes them. He takes them in his own time he takes them when he's ready for them to come home period death has a purpose without death there is no life without life There Is No Death. Sometimes things just have to happen now they happen. It's heartbreaking is sad it leaves a big hole in our hearts. But this happened death is part of life. I recently lost my aunt Pam to cancer. She was in the hospital room with strangers my Uncle Paul couldn't be with her while she died because of Corona. My aunt Pam died alone. She chose not to fight her cancer cuz she had it when she was younger. And she hated with the chemo did to her. And she swore she'd never put herself through it again. She had been suffering with cancer for quite some time but never let it keep her down. And God finally called her home. And she's in a better place. She's not in pain she's not hurting. So if my Uncle Paul all alone with a broken heart. But he'll see her again. It's never good-bye it's all see you later.
I'm so sorry for you and his family.
Rest in pest little guy. You will be missed.❤️
Rest in piece Braxton.
We'll always remember Braxton as he was and he was a good kid Rest in peace

You know u never really realize what u do makes a impact on something until something like this happens. I watched the treasure hunt video and it truly looked like Braxton was having the time of his life. Just think about it for a sec all Braxton wanted was to kick it with a dude he seen on YouTube. Jake u give me hope the the world isn’t totally lost yet. There are a few of us truly good people left in the world. I gave a homeless vet the shirt of my back once. RIP BRAXTON
Jake you got a big heart maing….   You’re a good guy, and you made a difference for Braxton!   Life can be cruel sometimes, we have to accept them.   But do not let the tragedy overshadow the memory of such a brave tenacious little guy!   RIP BW!
Rest in peace little fellow. ❤️❤️

I do enjoy the content you do, but i sadly can't donate... if i could i would to bring a smile back to your face and his families....  if you do see this, please tell me... and i will be sending prayers to his family and to you, God bless and have a good Day Jake If not, just know that God is there for you and everyone, through the good and bad, darkness and light, God is there.
Rest In Peace Braxton 🙏🏻

This is broke my heart💔💔💔💔😭😭😭
This is so sad 😭
Sorry to hear about Braxton. He was so very happy when you did that treasure hunt with him Jake. You are fortunate to be a part of his life. Rest in Peace Braxton.
I literally cried that whole time I’m so sad but first of all tho RIP Braxton Weidman I could write a whole book on this but I don’t want to do that in the comments. Jake u are the best, and u made Braxton so happy I watched the vid on the treasure hunt with him and I was blown away by the way that he was smiling the whole time. I have a utube channel of my own and I’m totally spreading the word that u are raising money for the Weidman family. I wish I could do more than that. I will keep u in my prayer Weidman family and don’t stop kicking butt with 2 T’s.
To the Weidman Family: From our house hold to yours our condolences. Losing a battle with cancer at such a young age is devastating. He was such a strong kid and deserved to live but know that he's no longer here in person but he will always be here in spirit. Take time to greave. You must do this. Take it from someone who has sat there in your shoes(with my grandmother) and took care of and watched the deterioration and you just know that there's nothing you can do. I know that pain. I don't wish this upon anyone. I hope you can feel the love and support from the YouTube community because that's what we are. A Community. We come together in times like these and support another. Braxton was a awesome little guy and he will truly be missed.   To Jake: Keep up the good work bud. Every day you make a impact on so may peoples lives. Braxton knew that. That's why he chose you for his wish. He wanted to have fun and be like you and make a impact. You are a awesome individual and I wish you all the success in life. Take some time to greave as well bud. I know this guy touched your heart in so many ways and it sucks to deal with a loss like this bud. Just know he's in a better place now.
You will be in soul for ever god bless to you and his family ❤️🙏
Braxton will help you out when hunting for treasure forever now! He will always be looking over you and his family! Stay strong legend!
God bless you, what a gift you gave him.
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Rest in Peace Braxton 🙏
Rest In Peace Braxton, your memory will live on forever ❤️
Everything happens for a reason Rest In Peace so sorry
He will be right next to you on ur hunting fun
Rip, Braxton's family you will be in my prayers.

Rest in peace braxton fly high little angle
Awww, this broke my heart 😔😭.. May that little trooper rest in peace❤🙏 My thoughts go out to the family 😔❤❤
This is so sad.literally broke my heart
To Braxton and family Braxton I am sure that you were a amazing son, friend, family member and more. I am sure that you were always trying to see what you do and to fight against the brain tumor  and you fight strong.   To the Family Braxton, I also know that you guys were always they with him along his side helping and staying up all night trying to see what you could do. You did the best that you could have done,  you gave him your heart and helped him get better not from the surgery’s but from showing him that you were there and that is the best you could do.
It was so sad to hear I was just crying watching this video rip Braxton

Riposa in pace piccolo angelo. Ora il paradiso è tutto tuo. I tesori più grandi sono lassù’, come i miei nonni ed un sacco di gente fantastica. Che Dio benedica la tua famiglia e tutti gli angeli che come te hanno lasciato questo mondo terreno per la vita eterna.  I’m sure that the most valuable treasure find was you. With love, Matteo from Italy.

Our sincere condolences to the Weidman family. Thank you for sharing a special memory.
🕊❤️
My heart & prayers go out to Braxtons family. I watched his video as soon as Jake posted it & it was amazing to watch him have an amazing day treasure hunting. He was so excited & his face just lit up! God Bless you Jake for not only granting his wish but for just being the amazing person that you are, you have just a huge & kind heart. Also, you didn’t just grant his wish, you continued a relationship with him & his family and that shows your heart. I’m praying for you too Jake & what an honor for Braxton to be holding the crystal you gave him & be buried with it. God Bless & Rest in Heaven Braxton 🙏🏼❤️
Some video's need not to be made sometimes. Heartbreaking and transparency but maybe he needed to just get it out the only way he knows how. I don't know how I would react either, crazy to even think about it honestly. Prayers
Rest in Peace little one❤
❤️

RIP Braxton you made a great difference to everyone in the world we honour your appearance and hope your family feel better after loosing you...
To the Weidman family, my truest and deepest condolences 💐 for Braxton, life shouldn't be this way  but Braxton is in Gods hands now. The world is a lesser place without Braxton but heaven has improved with Braxtons presents there. I believe in my heart that we will see all the people we lost in life again. You are very strong parents and you fought just as hard for Braxton just as Braxton fought for himself. May god be with you and your family during these difficult days. I'm sure Braxton would want you to remain as strong as he did and continue living life in the most positive and joyful ways. I'm so sorry for your loss.  Joseph.   Connecticut
Words escape me, respect to you for making his wish come true
Rest in peace Braxton

There was a good reason Braxton choose you Jake, because you are such a caring, decent, sensitive soul who likes to have fun - who knows how to find treasure and the good things in life.  I was only wondering the other day, how Braxton was, so I am heartbroken he lost his valiant battle.  He was a very brave soul, who shared a gift for life with so many who never even met him.  RIP Braxton - one of God's special angels...
Rest in peace big boy Braxton... God bless your family always!
My thoughts and prayer are with you and his family 🙏🙏🙏🙏
GODSPEED BRAXTON. Prayers coming to all. Thank you for sharing your story Jake.  Your a good person 💙

Hey Jake I enjoy your videos it's amazing the things you find or do....It's sad that Braxton didn't make it may he rest in peace but look at the positive in it you gave him the best day he got to have an adventure with you and with as emotional as you are about it just shows how big a heart you have and how caring you are... You're a very selfless person you don't see that as much as we should in this world especially the last couple years keep up everything your doing

Your're a legend Jake!. RIP Braxton
Rip braxton
As soon as I saw that Braxton had passed, I knew that you would be heartbroken. It's bittersweet to have been a part of his young life, only to see it end. Life is never certain, so it's inspiring to see you living out your best life for other's to see. Your example of doing the right thing, being vulnerable with the world and making it better a little bit at a time, is what we should all aspire to. More than ever, we need people like you to be authentic, adventurous and brave. As I type this, I am reminded that not all hope is lost! God has provided a way for Braxton to make his mark on this world, through you! Such a blessing! Now he is resting in heaven watching to see what your next adventure will be!   Continue to be a light in this dark world, Jake! The darkness can never win as long as we are there to light the way, and your light is shining brightly for so many to see! God bless you and your family! Remember, we can never fully appreciate love without experiencing loss, so while it is painful that Braxton is gone, God will redeem it for good! Think of how many kids, young adults and adults you reach, who will see Braxton's incredible spirit and light! This experience will forever change you, like so many other's have been changed before you. Death is so final and painful for us who are left behind, but because of God you will see Braxton again and he will be restored to full health! What a glorious reunion that will be! Big hugs and thank you for being real and showing us that it's okay to show emotion.
Rest in Peace Braxton. You fought so hard and to see you smile even despite all you had to go through, man you're just an absolute hero. I know you're looking down and watching over your family lil man.
🕊❤️
Sorry to hear this Jake. It was such a great thing you did for him, I watched it and it broke my heart to hear this. You have such a big heart and do so much for so many people. 😢😢

RIP Braxton, lost my aunt to brain cancer. Know exactly how you feel
Oh my God this breaks my heart rest in peace this is so heartbreaking
Rip
Jake, you meant so much to that lil man. You changed his life and made him feel like he was on top of the world. I know the feeling since I used to volunteer at Give Kids the World. It's hard to remain happy for them, but that's just what they deserve. Happiness till the very end. This did make me cry seeing his happy little face with the badge at the end. I hope he is doing good wherever he is now
You are the best you teach so much people the right thing to clean up
Thank you. For only being you. It's super sad, but Braxton is with you. You gave him something from you and he gave you something from him. It hurts a lot. But... he is in a save place and watched that video and kicked some butts 💛
Rest in peace Braxton you will be remembered fly high 🕊🕊🕊🕳

You’re feeling honored that of all the wishes, Braxton, could be granted, he chose to hang out with you. But my friend, you’re even more special than that, because you got to hang out with an Angel. May his family find comfort and support from those who surround them. R.I.P. young Braxton.

Sry rip 🙏
Rest in peace Braxton! 🙏
Rest In Peace Braxton
RIP little buddy ❤️
I hope he rests in peace
"Kicking butt with 2 T's " is awesome if u really thing about it. Because he was saying he's "kicking butt "( 2 T's) like he's pushing forward and fighting. He wasn't "kicking but" ( 1 T )   Like there's nothing he was contrasting. Like he wasn't saying he's kicking, but.....    He meant he was kicking Butt with 2 T's not 1....that's amazing
Rest In Peace Braxton you will be remembered forever fly high buddy
Treasure hunting in heaven, rip Braxton
My thoughts are with you and his family 💙
RIP and in love Braxton🤍🙏🏾
Love you Braxton. rip little buddy

When Buzz lightyear realized he was a toy. Hahaha. Sorry there is always a light side to jokes aside. If I hadn't I wouldn't be me and I appreciate you for what you did as well as the burden you put on your soul. The mind can take more than you think it can it all about managing it. May you do more in this area and not let it harm your soul as it is the warmth of your soul to do so. The most important part...
Rest easy kiddo your in a better place now 🕊
My God bless the hearts of those who were blessed to know Braxton with healing and love.

To have a humble request like his tells me that he came from a humble family! Why this was allowed to happen, I do not know! But I do know one thing, he is no longer suffering an that he's in the presence of Jesus Christ, and I'm sure he's telling Him about the wonderful time he had looking for treasure! May God turn your tears into blessings, and may He wrap you in His loving arms!

Fair play mate you're a good person 👍
As a parent, I can't imagine the loss of my child. What you did was amazing bro and you made Braxton HAPPY! RIP Braxton, keep the adventure going little man.
The fact that he chose you over anyone else, shows that he idolized you. You showed him that achieving your dreams is possible and I am sure that he treasured those moments that he got to spend with you for the rest of his life. I know that he will be waiting to hang out with you again on the other side. Hanging out with you was probably the best days of his life. I know that he treasured those days until the end. You are a great human being Jake! I hope you know that. Braxton is in a better place now. And I’m sure that he would want you to know that he is OK now. You our and forever will be his hero.
Rest in peace Braxton

My son was diagnosed with LGS which is a sever type of epilepsy.

This video brings me to tears cause at any given moment his time may come and I’m glad to see you gave this boy an amazing experience that will last forever with his soul. Bless you my guy.
Rest in peace

The impact these wishes have on these kids are something amazing to see. My wife is a wish granter and we've been able to see the miracles these wish truly have for these kids. Whether it empowers them to keep fighting or to have that moment of pure joy as a respite from the struggles they endure daily, these wishes mean so much to these kids and their families. Thank you for being willing to give Braxton those moments of pure happiness that made his time on earth better.
You are such a genuine guy man. you inspire many people. keep your head up and keeping killing the content. continue to help other kids the same way you did with braxton. you got this brother
RIP Braxton 👼🏻
rest in peace buddy 🤍🙏🏽
My thoughts to all involved. Life is precious.
You do great things, and help so many people, if it's cleaning up the local waters, or making children wishes come true, you amazing man! Never stop what you do, and never change the way you are. This video has much feels, I cried, but chin up. Much loving wishes to Braxton's family, and may him rest in peace, happy he got the best day ever!
It’s kids with unfortunate situations like this that reminds me to enjoy every moment of my own life that I am taking for granted. Let’s all kick butt with 2 T’s.
Rest In Peace God bless you, Braxton and his fam
Rip

The pain you feel is the price we pay for loving someone as much as we do. Your pain shows Braxton you cared so much and this community shows he will never ever be forgotten and it's the most anyone could do. You should be proud to give a child the day of his life and I'm so sorry for the pain you and his family are going through.
That little boy that big ❤️

RIP Braxton.
Rip Braxton much love gose out to your family will always remember u as have videos of u and jake rip my man 😪🤧🙏
❤❤❤❤❤
Jake I know it's hard. I have a daughter that had madula blastoma brain cancer. She went thru radiation and the tech radiate her too close to her short term memory. She didn't recognize me or know me. I drive a truck n would slip in really quietly she would wake up just to be with me. Then she doesn't know me and her mom has kept her from me for over 19 years. I do know what you are feeling. It's hard but you overcome it. Just remember he's in a better place now more pain n suffering. Go out to a creek just you and nothing else. No one else. Just sit there and listen close your eyes and say your personal goodbyes let it out don't hold onto it. It's not good.
Rip much luck
RIP bud..
We will miss you Braxton we will never forget you it is on
Rip little man bless you
My prayers go out to the family of Braxton and to you Jake. Thank you for sharing.
Rest in peace Braxton, you were such a cool little fella, you made me smile that whole video.

😖 Heart broken... Rest in Peace little man... You made your mark man, and that is what matters. The best thing anyone can do in life is make an impact on the world. You have made beyond an impact. Keep doing what you are doing and keep strong 👊
Damn dude, I hope it's of some consolation to read that you gave him one super special experience. I feel your pain yet can only imagine the pain the family is going through. I rarely see guys show their true emotions as much as I've seen you do. It's so very humbling to see how connected you become with your fans. I can only imagine that Braxton will be looking over you and your future expeditions. *big hugs to you and Braxtons family*

Sweet Braxton. 🥺😢
You should make a T-shirt that says “Kickin Butt with 2 T’s” and sale it and give the money from the shirts to Make A Wish and Braxton’s family
never comment on youtube videos!.. Your a legend brother. R.I.P Braxton! ✨💙
😔🤧🤧🤧😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔🙏
To lose a child is the hardest thing a parent can go through.  The video Jake made with Braxton was a great video. The time they spent together is what a great childhood is all about. Jake you can be sure you will see Braxton again and he will be whole and you two can pick up where you left off. God bless you all! 🙏
Rest and peace braxton fly high buddy

Jake, you are so tender hearted. You have so many followers and influence so many people and for you to be so humble and kind, it is a joy to see. Braxton is at peace now, no more suffering, no more pain. I pray for peace and strength for the Weidman’s. Little Braxton will always be with y’all. ❤️

Rest In Peace Braxton 🥺🙏🏼
Rip
You both made a wonderful impact on each other with your friendship and love.  Sorry to you and to Braxtons family for your loss.
You did a great thing my guy you made a kids dream come true not everyone gets to do that
May Braxton REST IN PEACE 🙏
😭💔
You’re a great dude.
I think I can say for all of us when I say his family will be in our prayers
No one should die of cancer when you can kill it easily with Oregano oil pills.  Take 5 pills 3 times a day for a week and everything will die.  Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide also kills cancer.  Put a couple drops in a full glass of water and drink it 3 times a day for a week.  Why do people still not know this info?  My high school Zoology teacher taught me cancer cannot survive in an oxygen environment and that was over 25 years ago, so idk why people still don't know this.  RIP little guy and hope you get born again soon.
"Kickin' butt with two T's" RIP buddy
Rest in peace Braxton! I hope you are in a better place
Rest easy little guy knowing that you will live on in over one million memories  Your life and legacy won’t be in vein  And Jake youre the true gem 💎  Rest In Peace
May your rest in peace Braxton
U made his lil life better dont b sad ur a gd guy
Long live Braxton the prince of treasure hunting
With u is the best part
RIP
I got this video on repeat. I know too many people who have lost their lives to cancer. One was brain cancer. It's not something that I would wish on anyone let alone witness it. I love your passion to put smiles on people's faces like this kid. RIP Braxton.
Also I love how your so caring towards this fantastic kid I'm 10 and I love watching you soooo much and one of my wishes is to go to that Cristal resort that u went to!!!
I hope you heal well 🙏 rip Braxton
Rest In Peace Braxton.
RIP Braxton ... Jake it is great to see the huge heart that you have. And great to see that what you do is making an impact on other people. I think you should make a Kickin BUTT shirt and sale it.
It is a very good thing you did to make that young boys wish come true he will be waiting for us in heaven I'm crying right now😭. God bless you brother 🙏 🙌 ❤
I grew up watching you when you were just a kid playing cod, and when I was just a kid trying to watch someone play black ops 2 seeing you Transition into diving and fishing. You defiantly make an impact on some peoples lives more than you think. I see you all over Facebook nowadays and I just wanna say congrats on doing your dream and doing what you love. Keep up the content and may Braxton Rest In Peace.
RIP
At least he did what he always wanted to do 🥺🥺

My heart goes out to everyone. It's not easy seeing a loved one yet alone a child go through cancer. I've had an experience with this although it had a happy ending. I am not good at comforting through through a comment I do much better with saying it face to face. Anyways I'm sending lots of love to everyone who was impacted by Braxton's death.
I know what you are going through my sister is the same so I'm here for you
I am praying for the Braxton family. Jake I have never balled my eyes out that much brother!  Thank you for introducing your viewers to Braxton! Incredible kid! Incredible family!
Rest easy Braxton, sending prayers for comfort for your family, I can’t begin to imagine what a loss this is.  God bless.
Rest in peace, little man. You were a fantastic treasure hunter. Well wishes to the family and you, Jake.
RIP Braxton. Jake you are an incredible person. You wear your heart on your sleeve. Thank you for doing what you do.

Every now and then I thought about how I figured this video would be coming. Its hard to see it so soon. Rest easy little man.
You did your best....
😔.. May He Rest Peacefully in the Presence of God… Deepest condolences to his really family and friends.
Rest in peace Braxton. ❤😥
It's all good brother. You were able to make a difference for him. Love you D
What a great opportunity to give a little boy a great day away from his worries. 🙏🏼
It hurts my heart to hear of one so young dying. 😢 My study of the Bible convinces me that God hurts when we hurt and wants to comfort us. (2 Corinthians 1:3,4) And that he will soon do away with death forever, and all the pain that goes with it. (Revelation 21:3,4) In the meantime, his promises for the future give us hope and help us cope with the pain of losing someone we love. (Acts 24:15) I hope looking at those Scriptures can help bring comfort to anyone that needs it. 💕
From the morris family we send are deep’s condolences for the family’s loss we are deeply saddened by it
So sorry to hear , Rip
Rest in peace Braxton 🙏
You have such a big heart, it’s no wonder that hanging out with you was his wish. Two beautiful souls united for a bigger purpose, Rest easy Braxton
Braxton will rest easy, Jesus will take care of him. Praying for the family and you.

This kid is so special and I hope you know how much he adored you. He battled and overcame so many obstacles during his 17 month journey, but never once complained-always finding the positive. He has the best family and parents who helped prolong his journey, even with doubts from the doctors. While God needed him for something important, he will always be important down here as well. I’m one of Braxton’s many cousins and though we didn’t get together very often, the time spent was a happy adventure. So much love to you, Jake for caring for him as well as making his dream come true! Continued prayers and love for our angel in the sky and his wonderful family and friends.
prayers to you and his family❤️
Braxton you made one good treasure hunter. Fly high buddy

Your son was unique and magic I would say and he got to live a wonderful life full of dreams despite the diseases that was consuming him and I know how hard it is to live with disease myself who as dispraxia, hypotonia and some other one. But your son was such a warrior he is much much stronger than I'll ever be in my life. He was wonderful. I wish you guys the best and he might not be with you physically anymore but he will always be in your heart and this is what count. Keep fighting for him!! All my love and support is directed to you guys you are so wonderful and did everything you could for him.

You are the kindest human!! Braxton was the cutest genuine little kid ❤️ RIP Sweet little man 😇
Maybe what he meant was: _Hey, how are you doing?_ -"I'm kickin', but..."- "I'm kickin' butt." One "t" is dwelling on a negative situation, but two "t's" is staying positive. A very profound little dude.
Rest In Peace to our favourite treasure hunter fly high bud.  Condolences to the family and to you Jake.   Much love 🙏❤️
God bless praying for his family and let him rest. In. Peace. ♥️
For 1 day u made that child of God feel like a little kid.. with you he was free from his chains- u taught him how to play and I think he ment u and him were the 2 'ts'... kicked butt with 2 Ts! No one should have to loose a child and im so sorry I see the sorrow this has left but when ur really sad remember he and you have something special that transcends this life.. the energy yall shared was sent into the universe and will forever be there for u to pull from when u need him to lift u up like u did for him.. bless ur soul

the Most valuable thing you found was him m8. Rest easy little man
Rest In Peace buddy.   Jake, props to you, his wish was to meet you, and you pulled through.
You're a good soul. It's clear that he had as much of an impact on you as you had on him, if not more so. Your genuine emotions in this video show just how much y'alls time together meant/means  to you. Sending you, but mostly his family love and strength in this difficult time. Braxton's family, as someone who has experienced a similar loss, this unbearable pain you feel right now is like a grain of sand in an oyster. Time will coat it and make it less painful, but it will always be there. Rest in Peace Braxton
Rest in peace and fly high
Praying for his family❤️❤️❤️ so very sad 😞
Rest in peace 💫 Thank you to you for making his dreams come true!
Jake. Better to care deeply for humanity than not at all. Doing things for other people is great for the soul. It can hurt but is greatly rewarding. Just remember that you made that lads pain go away for a day and replaced it with a memory he could draw on when things were bad and that is something to be proud of. Keep on doing what you do mate. RIP the little treasure hunter.
rest in peace Braxton, Fly high you will be remembered
Rest in peace Braxton you will be missed little man no matter what
We're all in this with you Jake, he was a good guy. We can just hope that he is happy wherever he's going to be. R.I.P

Rest In Peace to Braxton. Fly high little dude
Rip Braxton you are with the stars now.  Forever shining bright  🌟
R.I.P. Braxton you will be remembered forever as well as missed by your family, Jake, & all of Jake’s subscribers on Facebook & YouTube.   P.S. also to Braxton’s family I give you my condolences 💐 to you for your loss. I’m unbelievably sorry you had to go through something as devastating as losing a son or daughter. I know how you must be feeling because my best friend that I consider to be my brother. Well our sister actually went through the same thing Braxton did, and she unfortunately passed away from a brain tumor as well. But towards the end of her life his mom and him were letting me come over and spend time with her before she passed and I saw it just crush my friends and his families hearts and their was absolutely nothing I could have done to make them happy at least for a while. But I really considered her to be part of my own immediate family and it totally crushed me as well. So I just wanted to say that I’m so so so sorry you had to go through the same thing that we did. I hope you will be able to start the healing process ASAP. Also just know that Braxton is in a much better place than we are & he will always be by your side even though you can see him. He will definitely live on in yours, Jake’s, & All of Jake’s Subscribers on both media platforms.   P.P.S. Try to remember Braxton as he was before the tumor took him away from this sometimes Happy, & sometimes Depressing world we call life. Also Braxton and you guys will be in my prayers. And to that amazing kid/Survivor named Braxton I hope you are happy and having fun flying high up in heaven. I’m sorry you had to go through that buddy.
Why does this have to be true😭😭
Im sorry to hear that
RIP Brakton. You are a little legend.
Rest In Peace Braxton!   Praying for the family as they go through this hard time. May God grant them peace and comfort.

Jake you one special person bro and you impact a lot of people and it was amazing seeing you give that little boy the day of his life keep your head and kick butt with two Ts
This was extremely hard to watch. To the family, I'm extremely sorry for your loss. When I was five I was given the opportunity of a make-a-wish wish because I had cancer in my abdomen. Looking back on it now, it is crazy how kids can go through so much and still be happy. You helped fuel that Jake, but giving him his best life is all you could do. Now to Braxton family. You did everything to support Braxton, nurture him, love him, and give him his best life possible. Stay strong. And now to Braxton. Braxton you can rest now. May the lord let you rest alongside him in heaven. Be safe, be strong, and give love. Again my extreme condolences to Braxtons family. Stay together. Rest in peace Braxton. #RIPBRAXTON

I've had four family members diagnosed with cancer, three passed. Losing my Grandfather was the hardest and has left a hole that simply cannot be filled or mended. Cancer is pure evil and needs to be eradicated forever if possible. You and I may not live to see such a day but I pray maybe my son's will and what a joyous day it will be for the world. Hang in there Jake.
Just watching this video, I know, just for you, it was extremely hard. I can't imagine for his parents, family and friends, how it was for them. Very much appreciation for spending the time with him and his family. You made his Make-A-Wish come true! R.I.P. Braxton. We will all miss you! Love You!
💙💙🙏
Rest in Peace the lil treasure hunter *military salute*

He was a fighter and so strong so tough so brave. Just like you. He should’ve lived a life.

Literally I had just been listening to the song, with or without you just moments before
Kickin' butt (not "but" with one "t") with two "t"s.
I Just Know He's Hunting Treasure Rest Easy Braxton
Well damn. So very sad a young child's life has to get cut short for any reason.  I know you feel so proud to have been chosen as the person to spend part of his short life with you!! God bless sweetie!!
Thats rough man. I'm glad he got to spend some of his final moments with you having the most fun he has ever had. Thinking of you buddy.
Have a happy after life

I’m so sorry Braxton rest in pease you’ll always be remembered
Fly high Branxton You are inspirational ❤
I feel so bad

Hey jake, id just like to say, that as a Make-A-Wisher myself, that what you did for this young boy gave him the single most important and  amazing memory that he ever could have asked for. Those moments mean so much and granted him a moment of a life time for him to cherish. I cant imagine the sobering humility you must be feeling that such an honor would be granted to you, but your selflessness to give your time, heart and energy to this boy and his family is truly beautiful. I commend you greatly for also not just taking the one wish for granted, but to take the time knowing how youd be close by, to stop and see him again was awesome. Cancer is a horrific monster but to see how he still recognized you and felt joy by your presence just shows how important you were to him.
Rip Brattain 😢
You made his dream come true that was probably the best time of his life rip fly high Braxton
I watched that  episode with Braxton . He was so excited finding all those treasures with you . My heart goes out to you and Braxton's family

“Kickin’ butt with two ‘T’s” 💛
Rest well spiffy lil dude. Glad you had a blast with Scuba Jake. Jake buddy, you gave him an adventure he thought he could only dream of. You started off his hero but became his mate. He's out of pain and treasure hunting on the ultimate adventure now. He won. Many go through long lives without living their dreams. Thanks to you he lived his.
I hate seeing you like this man but i completely understand and im sure you have heard this already but you really brightened up his last couple years. RIP Braxton, fly high my man.
My heart breaks for his family I am so sorry.
Rip
😭😢 I feel bad for you that you had to go through this man! 😪 Be strong! 💪 💪
we love you jack
Man I so sorry he seem like a amazing person and hope his family are well and I have much respect for you
My heart hurts for this beautiful boy, his parents and all family members. You did a great thing for Braxton, and I had so much fun watching the time you spent with him. I know your heart is broken for this brave little soul.  RIP little angel.
Fly high little bro <3

You made his dream come true ❤  rest in peace Braxton praying for the family
I cried watching this video…….. Rest in peace little guy.. we love you.
😭rip
I know that this will sound cliché but I am so sorry for your loss. I didn’t know Braxton, but from my point of view, he seemed to be a vibrant child. Losing a loved one is never easy, let alone someone so young. He is no longer suffering from the pain of the surgeries and brain tumor. I know that this may not seem to be the answer the family nor anyone else was hoping, but I do know that The Lord saw fit to bring him home before he had to suffer anymore in this life. I am praying for Braxton’s family and friends.
Got my son out of bed to watch this, you are such a great role model for him! He tries to recreate every adventure. Thank you for being who you are!
Rest In Peace Braxton, prayers to the family
Fly high lil dude 🥺🕊
Rip Braxton
The reason I follow you. Rest in peace 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Man you did a great thing u should be proud rest in peace braxton.
You got me crying 🥺
Hugs and prayers to Braxdon and D. The video you did with him ment the world to him you cloud see it in his eyes . He's not hurting anymore and he will always be in our prayers 🙏. Thank you D for sharing this video.
We love you braxton
Braxton will be remembered in all of our hearts ♥️
You’re right he could of done anything for his birthday but he picked you. Everything happens for a reason, you were his reason. He loved you and he’ll forever be your little buddy. Big hugs to you and Braxtons family.

Rest in paradise Braxton 😢
Rip Braxton this had me crying to
That is so sad he is in a better place thank God for his life on this earth he changed so many people
so much innocence and love braxton had. It's absolutely heart wrenching to see anyone with cancer let alone a child. My deepest condolences to Weidman family I'm sure that the thousands of people who watch this video will share this sentiment, Braxton was and always will be a role model for perseverance and strength and thanks to Dallymyd all of us were blessed to witness him.
Rest In Peace little man
Rest In Peace Braxton. Every child wishes for adventure and seeing his smiling face was the best gift you could’ve ever gotten from that beautiful young boy. Jake, you have such a golden heart and I think in honor of Braxton, you should either seek out or help as many children like this. Braxton was definitely happy to spend his day with you, so that memory will never disappear. Remember this: “Loving someone is the bravest thing you can do, so let go and be happy even if it’s just for a little while.” No doubt about it, that small adventure you had with Braxton meant the world to him up until his last moments.
What a day you gave Braxton. This has also impacted your life in a very special way too. RIP Braxton!
R.i.p Branxton fly high with God and may you rest in piece 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Rest easy Braxton.. DALLMYD you are an awesome young man..

You have a fanbase that looks up to brother. Braxton is proof of that. You gave that kid one of the best memory's and gifts for him. R.I.P little buddy.
This is Really Sad 😭😭😭
Rip Braxton #CancerSucks

Being someone who has lost a few loved ones to cancer. I will say this, Braxton, for how long you fought the thing that tried to tear you down. You are a warrior through and through. You will be remembered.
Braxton my friend Rest In Peace my friend lord hold braxton in your arms and hold him in heaven Braxton will never be forgotten 🙏
What you have shared with us is absolutely incredible. I watched your video with Braxton and it was obvious you cared a lot. I know you are hurting a lot right now but I hope you are still open to any other Make-A-Wish requests. To the Weidman family, your love shines brightly and thank you for sharing Braxton's journey with us. Please allow me to hug all of you virtually. I am sobbing but happy he had such an awesome day.
So sorry, I’m praying for his family! He definitely will be remembered!!

Here’s the thing absolutely it’s sad and upsetting however I can tell you understand the concept of you yourself being picked for an individual to choose you for Make-A-Wish is the biggest honor you could ever have yeah unfortunately there is sad outcome sometimes miracles do happen but he is in a better place he’s not in pain anymore he’s good keep what you’re doing man just keep what you’re doing that will make him proud he already has and was
I watched the video yesterday, I see this on my recommended my jaw drops, this is so sad. May he Rest In Peace and hope everyone heals.

Thoughts and prayers to the family rip Braxton
Rip Braxton thank u jake for making this lil boys dream come true your an amazing person never change
GodBless you Braxton.🙏 All the love and prayers to the family. Jake, thank you for making his final wish come true, and just know that he's probably already found treasure in heaven!🥰💖💞💕
He's in Jesus' hands now. You were very blessed for him to have chosen you for his make a wish.
We loved you Braxton!
Rip Braxton man fly high man. At least he's in a better place now Jake don't be sad that he's gone. Be happy that his pain that was hurting him so much. Is noe gone and he is not in pain anymore so don't cry man he's alright now
Hey yall, just thought I'd leave something, I know how it feels to have lost something so important in your life, FE I lost my sister just a few months before I was born, so even though I never new her, it still means a lot to me. Also, a few years back we had to put down our dog which was the worst thing I have ever felt in my whole life, But what you all need to know is that it will never feel better, but you need to remember what impact they left on your life and how they made you happy.   :)  Love you George
Hearts of gold, drawn together.
At least you made a dream come true unlike like Sniperwolf .  Your a good man thank you for taking time out of your life to hangout with a kid May your life be blessed
God bless you, Jake.  I'm sure you made Braxton's day special.  He also gave you a gift.  You may not know it now, but you will some day.  Little kids have this uncanny ability to see and seek out good people and his wish was to spend the day with you.  You're one of the good ones, my friend.  And that is so rare these days.  You'll have this memory for the rest of your life.  When you think back on it, think about how happy you made him.  If you ever want to go shark diving, look me up.  I'd be honored to buddy up with you take you on an adventure, SoFl style.   Keep the faith!
❤️
So sad. Condolences to you Jake and to Braxton's family.
Rest in peace little man
You are an amazing person for all that you do!
Happy treasure hunting little  angel. R.I.P. Braxton..

Little Braxton is flying high, flying free and he is in no pain and no worries. Your little Braxton will be within your hearts and soul forever and his spirit will always will be by your sides holding your hands forever.

Braxton truly was deserving of spending time with you and having a great day. cancer can get you at anytime and that's why I cried a lot for this video because as a kid you should never get cancer because you have not got to experience life yet its its not sad its beyond that.
Rest in peace Braxton.  Jake, you're a stand-up guy.  please keep being you
Rest In Peace
Rip
Incredible! You should make a t-shirt with that saying on it... "Kicking butt, with 2 T's!" . Amazing friend story.
Rip Braxton !!! He actually was an amazing kid and loved being out with you Jake. That was his best day ever and my condolences to the family.
Rest in paradise Braxton!!!

Rip
God bless Braxton's family and you Jake. Giving to others is the best thing you can do for yourself.
Rest in peace ❤
I'm a first responder and the only thing that gets me every time is when it's a kid. I feel your pain, but always hold that moment in your heart, when you made that day so special for him. Do that for any other that you do it for in the future, too. Takes a special person to go out of your way to make someone else's day better in their worst times. Bless you and bless Braxton and his family. 🙏🏼
R.I.P
I gained a lot of respect for you after this video Jake. I’ve watched your videos for a while, your a good man. Much respect…. Rest In Peace Braxton!

R.I.P braxton
Rest easy buddy. Sad to see such a young amazing kid leave this planet 😢
Rip little man may God bring peace to your family and friends including you Jake
As a friend of Braxton, this is heartbreaking. I never expected this to happen to Braxton, but it did. Braxton is one of the most kind, caring, funny kid I’ve ever been around and I wish I could’ve known this would happen to Braxton so I could spend more time with him. He put up one hell of a fight and is one tough person. I never knew how much Braxton has made an impact on my life until he passed away.   May he Rest In Peace…  P.S. This is Braxton’s channel  youtube.com/channel/UCKzpeRNQ9k8hB7AmzuRPNfw  I hope the channel will give you a better idea of what a wonderful person Braxton was. (I had the honors of recording the last few) Rest In Peace Braxton  2/1/22
Man, my little ones name is Braxton and this hit hard! To often we all take life for granted. Praying for you and the family!

Thank you for doing what you did. I hope again you can do it again. Young lives are precious! What a moment! I feel your journey at this time!
I balled the whole time you talked, my Aunt had a petting Zoo and horse ranch in R.I. and kids ( boys and girls) from Make-A-Wish would come up and work, I told one child that I will see him next year, and he said with a straight face ( no you won't I am going to die before that!) and he did and I cried for weeks, I even cried when the next round of kids came the next year and only one out of ten made it back! I'm crying as I text this! A big pile of mush right now! I'm so sorry for your loss and The Weidman's family!
im so sorry this happened, Braxton was a great kid not great but an amazing kid, we love you buddy may you rest in peace
R.i.p Braxton!!!! I hate that kids gotta go thru this 😢😢😢😢

Rest Easy Braxton You can go scooba diving in the clouds now, go find yourself some stars
Even I cried watching this video. Its tough man it really is I'm really sorry Jake we all know you made a difference and that's all that matters.
I don't know if this comment will even be seen, but I want the Weidman family to know that all of my prayers go out to them! I can't really make anything better from a comment section, but just know if I could I would give you guys all you need! RIP Braxton and may he forever stay "kicking butt with 2 T's! Also to Jake, I want you to know that you are an amazing person for doing what you do, and please keep being you! You mean so much to so many people! You inspire me to go above and beyond for others and do more in about every aspect of life! Hold your head up and keep it up just like you always have. I hope the Wiedman family has some comfort knowing that a great community will continue to support you along side Jake!
God honors the love and joy you shared with Braxton. Praying for the family and for you!  Keep Braxton in your heart!

For god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and whoever believes in him should not Parrish but have everlasting life John 3:16 don’t worry he is with the lord where there is no pain and no suffering. Much blessings to Jake and the family❤️

💔😭Rest in Peace sweet Angel!

I am very sorry jake, he is living atleast not suffering pain, fly high Braxton 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Rip kid. Fly. High😭😭🕊
😢My heart goes out to you DALLMYD and to Braxton’s Family too!!! Keep all your good memories of Braxton close to your hearts until you see him again up in Heaven!
No I'm so sorry😥😭, I knew it was bad when I seen you in tears😭😥😭
Jake thank you for the update, continue to keep you heart soft and thank you - you where a blessing and were blessed by serving this little guy plus you helped the parents too because you cared and shined a bit of love into all their lives - WAY TO GO ... BTW I had tears along side yours brother. God Bless - stay soft in the heart, safe and well - Jim
Peace be with Braxton, his family, and you.🙏❤️
Rest well Braxton, Heaven got an Angel who kicks butt with two t’s
You are so amazing I love your heart.
You gave a dream to a child, and as such made that day so much brighter for him and his family. Some candles burn slow and steady, others are so bright and beautiful they are almost blinding, but they burn out sooner. Braxton was the brightest, and you were part of that, thank you. Rest in peace.
My mom passed away from cancer. That last month was the hardest. You are an amazing person Jake. Hopefully he is hanging on tight to that crystal. Love you jake.
Rest In Peace Braxton well remember you forever bro bro
My condolences and Prayers to the Boys Family and Friends. RIP Little Treasure Hunter!
Don’t be sad because he’s gone. Be happy he was here.
"Kickin' butt w/ 2 "T's" sounds like a great idea for  a shirt! Then you could donate those proceeds to children's cancer research or The St. Judes hospital for children.  Many prayers to Braxton's family!
So what you're saying is the more I watch this video the more the family will make to take care of expenses I will watch it once every day just to help the family out no one deserves this especially losing your child
Rest in peace Braxton 🙏
God Bless You Braxton
Jake you are an amazing human and God has given you this life to bless so many people!
I watched the video and sorry to hear this news and he just got his wings and flew home were there us no more hurt sadness or suffering he's home now
Braxton chose the best person in the world to have his last memory’s with and spend time with you and I’m sure he’s looking down on you and always with you by your side treasure hunting with you always. Rest In Peace Braxton ❤️🥺
RIP Braxton
We all love you Braxton 😇😇

Say Hello to God for us Braxton!
REST IN PEACE🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏Stay strong BRAXTONS
Rest in peace Little Braxton. U will always be remembered with the cute smile u had 😢😢
Couldn’t get through the video. I’m so sad to hear this. Braxton, I hope you are treasure hunting up there in heaven and of course finding all the cool treasures. To the family, I’m sorry for your loss. No child should go that soon. I hope you guys are holding up well. Sending lots of love.
You are an inspiration Jake everyday. Never stop doing what you love. Dive in peace Braxton.
RIP  hope he's in paradise
I resonate with your pain man I lost my mum to a brain tumour and it such horrible thing to deal with , he’s in a better place now and just know you made his life special in the time he had ❤️
Weidman family,  I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost my youngest daughter to a drunk driver, so I can kind of understand your pain and suffering.  People will say that it will get better, you'll get over it in time... Sadly I have found that to not be true. I don't think that we ever get over the loss of a child. It's something you carry with you forever, at least it has been for me. If you ever need to just talk, I am always available to you. Just comment here and I will see it and get back to you as soon as I can. Rest in peace Braxton, you were well and truly loved by many.
Rip
he's gonna have a good life with you and God
rest in peace 🙏
🕊🕊🕊rip😥
Jake rely on your dog treasure to help you with this hard time
Rest in peace Braxton, I'm sorry to here this

I remember watching that video…it was totally awesome….and now watching this, just breaks my soul! I haven’t cried to ANY YouTube video…then I watched this one…..
Rest In Peace Braxton fly high you will be in my heart and other peoples  Hold you feel better man I’m sorry for what happened I’m crying for 2 hours with you man
Rest In Peace, Braxton. There's nothing more innocent than a child trying to pull through a sickness. I know that it might be rough on you, Jake...but one thing that you can and should be proud of is that of all of the things that Braxton could have watched, he liked your channel so much. There's no telling how many ridiculous amounts of hours he has watched your videos - perhaps even every single one of them many times. Then he got to meet you and you made his day. He got his wish fulfilled very well. One of the greatest gifts that you can give a kid like this with limited time is what their ultimate wish is and you've done that. You also did it unknowingly because even during times when he undoubtedly didn't feel well, was getting treatments, etc., he would use your videos to experience the adventure that he could physically enjoy. You did it for him and recorded it and it was almost as much fun for him as being there. That made far more than just one of his days through the Make-A-Wish. The only other thing that you don't have to do, but are already doing, is continuing to raise money for other kids to also fulfill their dreams. Here's hoping that other Braxtons in the future also get to fulfill a similar wish through you. If your channel wasn't here and you weren't doing these things, then Braxton wouldn't have had an outlet to physically enjoy something vs watching cartoons or many of the other non-interactive things that boys his age typically are focused on. Now he's finding all kinds of good stuff on the other side. Maybe we can all have a treasure hunting party someday with Braxton. Can't wait, little buddy.
As we pray for Braxton family also pray for Dallmyd he is really hurting now also .
Rest up buddy
Rest in Peace Braxton🕊
So so sad, he is resting in peace now knowing he had the most amazing adventure with the most amazing human possible!! Xx
I hate brain cancer and all the other types of cancer, especially in children. Rest with the angels, Braxton Weidman. You fought a great fight and now you are free from pain and suffering.  Prayers for your family and friends. Jake, God bless you for making this young man's day.
Prayers for the family. As a father myself I can't imagine what they are feeling. I hope they can find peace
So so sorry to hear about their loss. May he Rest In Peace. God will take care of him now.
R.I.P BRAXTON🙏
You're a good man Jake. Rest easy Braxton

You can see the Smile on Braxton face he enjoyed every minute of it! I’m glad as I’m sure all of your followers we got to see this adventure it look like Braxton got what he wanted that day and so much more, you truly gave him HIS WISH!!

Braxton died, but he died fulfilling his wish. 🥺 Rest In Peace Braxton.
Rest in peace little man sad news
Dude. This is the time to get an awesome Braxton tattoo. Kickin butt with 2 T’s.
He is resting now. Watching over you every single day. Fly high Braxton
I have an idea.? Why not go to Braxton's grave, put down a crystal that is in a clear box either on his grave or near it.? 🤔 I think that would be beautiful. I feel bad for his family rest in paradise Braxton. 💔
Braxton much love rip little brother u will be missed blessed be and much love to your family
Rest In Peace
Rest easy fly high 💔
Rest in peace little man  Jake you are an amazing person keep strong brother
Rest In Peace
I lost my godfather due to a sudden heart attack. He had the comedic touch of Chris Farley and the biggest heart out of anyone I ever knew. When I came to visit him in the hospital, I saw him on a ventilator an inch away from death and he still found the strength to break a smile even though he couldn't move his limbs or even talk at all. It's rough going through a loss like this. But you're not alone. We are all here for you and his family no matter what
.
Rest now lil man you're flying with the angels whole and healthy. D, you are an amazing man for making his dream come true. Stay strong
The “Make A Wish Foundation” is by far the best charities, and a close second is any Childrens Hospital. God put Braxton and you together. Tears are flowing.
Rest in peace braxton
RIP Braxton fly high buddy
my gram passed away on december 30th she will see braxton rest in peace
Beautiful tribute! RIP little man!
Rest In Peace Braxton 🕊❤️‍🔥😇
Sorry bro..  that cant be easy at all.  My heart goes out to you and his family.  Sad deal.  But I give you Tons of respect for getting involved with make a wish and giving that boy some love!  R.I.P. young man
Rest In Peace
Rest in peace little man. And you are a good man for shouting out and doing this
Rest in peace. Jake your an amazing person and beautiful soul. Your an awesome big brother to him
Peacefully rest In Heaven young Braxton i truly see that you care so much for Braxton and it is so sad to see that he is gone and to see how you feel just makes me wonder how bad his family feels he lived a life that most of us would not enjoy but he was just so greatful for everything and that is what makes me have so much respect for him but we all should not be sad because that is not what Braxton would want so if some people could leave positive thoughts inside of the comments instead of putting sad comments because that makes no one happy so can people put comments that would put a smile on people's faces and i would be so greatful to see that at least one person would do that and i am pretty sure that Braxton's family would be looking at these comments and i'm sure that they do not want to see RIP braxton in every comment i am sure that it would make them cry and if they did cry i'm sure that we all would want them to be crying happy tears oh yeah and one more thing lets keep KICKIN BUT WITH TWO TEES
May he Rest In Peace you have a beautiful heart.
You did good man, Braxton appreciated it a lot. Be happy for him, RIP.
Rest in peace Braxton fly high little man

Rest in peace little angle fly high dream big
I am so sorry for the loss of such a treasure. However, he is okay, he is no longer in pain, he is happy. He is sitting face to face with the lord right now getting every treasure he could ever want. He is at peace and to know that you, here today, made this kid that much happier before his going, is not only the best treasure you will ever have but one that will stick with you forever. Jake, you are forever awesome and we are here for you and the family. Much love and prayers!!!
Vaccines have been causing cancer since the 50's

sorry for your loss . thoughts and prayers to Braxton''s family
Jake I just wanted to thank you for introducing me to Brax. Brax changed my life. I was living in a dark place. And I followed his family after that day. And the kid took me out of it! Seeing how he lived life to the fullest. Made what I am going through seem like nothing. So thank you. It may have saved my life.  I am so sad he died. But  I watched my grandfather go through something simular with his cancer. So I know Brax is fine now. And I made a promise to Brax to kick vutt with 2 ts. Thank you Jake.
I watch that video and he had so much fun. RIP little man. Prayers
RIP sweet boy
Jake you and your crew are awesome!!!
Rest In Peace!!
You made an impact and that’s what mattered.  Now that he’s made one on you you just keep carrying on and you’ll never know who else you’ll impact.
Rest in peace little dude you have came so far in this world and I pray that your family will be ok and Jake I pray that your ok after hearing the sad news I pray that everyone is well and make a full recovery from all the sad times

Childhood cancer is like 200% because of preservatives in food, water and medicine including vaccines.. If you give your child any vaccine. You should be tied up and given injections back to back till your heart stops beating.

Thank you for making this little man's day by spending it with you. You're right, he could have chosen anything else, but he chose you. That goes to show what an impact you have on your fans. RIP Braxton. God called you up, because he has a plan for you. Prayers!

Rip little man
I am so sorry. Condolences to you and the family. Braxton is now healthy and hunting for treasure where ever he be. He was such a brave child and fought so hard. You made his life with just one day.
Brain tumors are terrible. My sister died from a brain tumor in her early 30's and I know what you mean when you said he was there, but wasn't there. That's how my sister was at the end too. It's awful. RIP Braxton
Don’t worry you will get better it is always hard DALLY it’s gonna be hard but you got this. Braxton I hope you spread your wings and fly high… ❤️ you will be missed a lot.
Rest in peace Braxton
You're  a great person  Jake!! RIP Braxton  no more suffering  little  bubby
Brother you were his hero for what you did for Braxton. I watched the video Rest Easy Braxton
RIP.  The thing about making it in life is that you have the power to change someones life. Whether directly or indirectly, you make a difference.  You gave joy to someone and meant more than you could have imagined and gave him a great memory.
Damn, we lost a good one. Hope your doin good Braxton, wherever you may be.
That’s so sad he seemed like such a nice kid 😕
This is so true:  A wife who loses a husband is called a widow. A husband who loses a wife is called a widower. A child who loses his parents is called an orphan. There is no word for a parent who loses a child. That’s how awful the loss is. – Jay Neugeboren — An Orphan’s Tale — 1976
Rip little buddy

Thank you for sharing your raw emotion putting your heart out there.
My cousin, Braxton, was such a fire cracker! He was one of the smartest and wittiest little kids I have ever met. I remember sitting on the back porch with him. He made up riddles on the fly that stumped me! Thank you so much, Jake, for being part of my little cousin’s life. You made such a massive impact. What you did for him not only lifted his spirits, but also the rest of our family’s. You allowed him to be a kid. This week has been very tough on all of us, and I know you share that pain. I will be forever grateful for the impact you made. 💕
May God bless your memories  that bring joy and comfort to your hearts...May He bring peace Thu o your shattered dreams.... Rest in the knowledge that you can join him in Heaven one day... Trust in God and His promises.
Rest In Peace Braxton 🙏

Man, Jake. I wish I could donate, but I cannot because I'm to young to make the money. But his family has all my heart and love for what they just went through. Fly High, Braxton. You will be missed dearly, buddy. Sorry for your lost to those who knew him.
You said that out of everything he could ever want to do he chose to hang out with you. Don’t sell yourself short. An adventure with you WAS everything he ever wanted to do. You have a platform that encourages young people to want to explore the world around them. Not just the world with their electronic device. You gave him a day to not worry about all the hard stuff he had to endure and just live. You are an amazing man with a huge heart. Amen to you. May he rest in piece.
So sorry

My heart 💔. Life is full of pain, but when people like you do those things i always get some hope. Keep it up man. Also my condolences to the family. So damn sad.
ANGLES AMONG US, RIP LITTLE  BUDDY!
He is in haven watching over you and he will always be right by your side day and night and in all of our prayers 🙏🏽😇😇😇🕊
Dude that is so awesome that you did that .you are a good people .we need more like you
So sad 😭 am praying 🙏 for his family
RIP Braxton. Jake you should feel proud of what you did for Braxton, look you gave him a time of his life that he wouldn’t forget. You  are a true gentleman with real emotion so it’s ok to cry because you in your heart you will do it again, I’m proud of you 👍
Oh my gosh. Such a sad moment, but we gotta know he's in a better place no longer suffering. Rest in peace young Angel, you will forever be missed. You made a wonderful part of this world.
Rest In Peace Braxton
Don't worry he is treasure hunting in heaven
It's pretty rough to think we have to put a like on such a sad story but I know this is how he can make money that he so gratefully decided to give to the family. What a great move Jake, one more reason why we love you and love to follow you. Your such a kindhearted person and I now know exactly why Braxton chose you for his make a wish. Braxton, Rest In Peace little man and look out for your family and loved ones up there and save them a place beside you for when god decides to send you a friend but I know you probably already made a bunch of friends up there and that you are probably running around with no more pain and "that" makes me happy for you just to be pain free. Don't forget about the millions of people that followed your story and that will be crying tonight like Jake a bunch of others like me and I didn't even have the honor to meet you. It's just that god or Jesus is not suppose to take or children before they take us, the parents. RIP Braxton and my sincere condolences to the family and the people that had the chance to be around you for your too short of a life. Ok I'll stop cause I could write all night that's how sad this makes me. #restinpeacebraxton
As part of your community I just want to say that I see that this takes a toll not only on you but on all of us Braxton will be missed but he is with the lord now. No more suffering only peace. Much love to the family and to you as well for making his wish come true your truly amazing.
Condolences to his family (you) and friends.
You're a good  man x

Rest In Peace Braxton.❤️ Fly High Little Guy
Prayers for comfort for u all. Thanks to you for being an inspiring person with your platform. Keep your head up!
It is extremely tough to lose a child, family or friend.

Man I'm telling you this now. That things can go good. things can go bad. You can't control it. Many people wish they can control it but it's just something that we can't control. It's just the way of our life in and your right he was just a kid there's many kids that died out here today which is wrong but life is just going to keep throwing things out us. Just be prepared
He is safe in the lords arms now and without any pain.

You should make a hoodie that says kicking butt with two T.T’s an picture of the crystal he gave you an place it on the left stitched in the hoodie but the same color of the actual crystal an the writing in cursive across the middle of the back….   Braxton your a strong one 🙏
Thank you for being kind enough to allow him to live out a dream of his. Some people don’t realize what a little kindness can do. Sorry to the family for their loss. He hopefully will be a shining star in another child’s dream.
We are all here with you Jake and you did your best.
Thanks for sharing that Jake that was a very emotional. And quite the reminder that things happen quick and much love to that family!
RIP Braxton I’m sorry 😞 life is  tuff buddy

Rest in Peace
Rest In Peace Braxton
You’ve touched more people than you’ll ever know little dude. Rest Easy Braxton 🙏
Rest In Peace Braxton🙏🏼
I’m so sorry to hear that. He was such a great kid. You said he lost his battle to cancer, but in my opinion he won, because he kept being so happy, smiley, and positive right to the very end. He didn’t let the cancer take his happiness away. Being a cancer survivor myself, I think that’s the true battle.  The make-a-wish video you did with him will stand as a lasting testimony of that.
RIP Braxton 🕊
Rest in peace Braxton. You were a great kid and will be remembered.
🙏🕊
🤜 🤛
Braxton was such a nice young kid and to know that he chose to hang out with DALLMYD for his wish is amazing out of a;l the other things he could do. He is such an inspiration. Rest In Peace
Fly high
May he Rest In Peace and may you rest knowing that you sir blessed Braxton more than you will ever know. RIP BRAXTON!
You are so selfless. You spent genuine time planning out the best day he probably ever had, and you really cared about him and his family. The part about you giving him the crystal which was clearly important to you, and the text about him being hurried with it, that got me man. Kudos to you for donating all the money to his family, and for the fundraiser. You’re a hero, and little Braxton died knowing that. Rest in peace Braxton ❤️
Rest in Peace, you were such a good hearted boy who reach for the stars and will always love in are hearts. Now search for treasures in heaven.
R.I.P Braxton
Damn I’m sitting here crying dude. What you did was awesome!
Thank you Jake, Braxton and family for enriching my life with your story of courage and compassion!  Your legacy will live on to inspire all of us!

Rest in Peace Braxton you'll be missed but never forgotten. And for the family sorry for your loss of a child.   Jake just remember the good times you had with Braxton and his family and Make the Wish Foundation and everyone that made that wish come true.
Nothing made me happier to see him happy and get his wish come true. Life is cruel at times It all happens for a reason and we have to trust the process.
rest in peace.
Rest in peace sweet Braxton.
Sharing for Braxton and his family.
Life is made of good and bad times.. and you definitely added to this little guys good times... You should be super proud of that! We all are  (Taken from a TV show.. but very relevant)
What an incredible story of one little boy's life-wish...and the incredible way one little boy's life-wish was turned into a friendship that will last forever!   My prayers are with Braxton's family and friends, including you, Jake.  God bless you and give you peace.   ✝️
Rest in heaven ❤️ continue to find your love of treasure!
sry for your loss man
RIP Braxton. I am so glad you got to get your Make A Wish trip.  Prayers for the family.
He didn’t lose the battle, he won and gained his wings.  Thank you for making his time here that much brighter.  Prayers the family finds peace and same for you Jake.
You are such a good soul Jake!!  What a blessing to be able to spend an entire day with Braxton and be his sidekick while he treasure hunts!  My heart goes out for the family and anyone blessed enough to have known that little warrior!!  I bet he had such an amazing reception in Heaven waiting on him!!  Love to you all!
RIP Braxton you will be missed sending prayers to his family and I hope he rest peacefully
Come down ok
Thank you for bringing joy to Braxton’s life and for sharing the experience with us.  I love your tender heart and generous spirit.  Rest In Peace Braxton.  God bless.
Precious Braxton. In the arms of Jesus. 🙏🏻
What an honour you have been to Braxton, you have been his hero. Thanks for all the support and making his wish come true Jake. To Braxton’s mom and dad, sending you a big hug, May the lord be with you and you experience the lords peace at this difficult time. Rest in peace Braxton.
RIP Braxton
Wish  Braxton  Rest in Peace with god man I  almost cried just thinking about it
RIP little man !
What a great memory. Braxton must have had a tremendous time being with you looking for treasure. Thank you for your kindness.
R.I.P Braxton 💜  Respect mate
I’m so sorry this had to happen. I am crying and  I could not imagine having to go through that.
I absolutely bawled my eyes out watching this update, after watching the original make a wish video you guys did.  He was one cool kid, humble, fun loving, filled with the excitement of life we should all be filled with every day.   Top job Mum and Dad, you did everything and gave it all of your energy to allow Braxton a short shot at being a regular kid and not let his illness define him.  I'm so so sorry you had such a supernova human taken from you so early. The brightest stars burn hottest and fastest sometimes.  I hope the universe grants you some peace and fast healing.   Grief isn't sadness or the absence of  love, it's the proof that love is still there even if the person isn't.  🇬🇧 🙏🏻 Namastè 🙏🏻 🇬🇧
Rip braxton, you will never be forgotten. Legends are never forgotten 🙏🕊
🥺fly high little one
Its so sad rest in peace buddy we just need everyone to donate 1 or 2 dollars and we can raise over 30 grand its just one dollar💜💜💜😭😭😭

Make a wish is such an amazing organization. I’ve had the absolute pleasure of participating in a wish. It was the greatest honor of my life. Getting that news was one of the hardest things I’ve ever dealt with. Wonderful thing you did. Prayers to you and his family.
Fly high Braxton
Rest In Peace little buddy
RIP To braxton cancer sucks and its the worst thing in this world every one should set aside there diffrences for just a day and think about this crap going on there these kids struggling but rest in peace braxton we will see you one day up in the clods
Bless your heart!  Praying for his family!❤️
Prayers for you buddy god bless you
So sorry for the loss of Braxton. Thank you for sharing your heart with us. You have a big heart. God Bless
What you did for him was wonderful and then to still see him after the Make-A-Wish episode just shows what an amazing person you are. Childhood cancer is terrible. Prayers to his family and to you 🙏🏻😢
Bless the both of you! ❤️
and god bless jake braxton and his family
Heartbreaking. You're a great guy Jake. We see what Braxton saw. Rest in peace little guy. We're glad you let us in on your wish.
Fly high king 👑
Sorry Braxton’s family
Deepest condolences to the Weidman family, thoughts and prayers are with you all.  Jake, kudos to you for having made Braxton’s wish come true.
RIP braxton
Watching this video was hard.  I cant imagine trying to hold it together on the other side of the camera.  Jake you gave Braxton more than just a day with his favorite Youtuber.  You started a friendship with Braxton.  You continued to stop by and check in on him when most people would have been one and done, and on to the next one.  This shows us and to me that you care greatly for those around you and those whom admire you.  It's never easy losing a friend, and no parent should have to bury their child, but it's a harsh reality that we ALL have to face at times.   You did everything you could to make Braxton smile, and gave him more motivation the. You will ever know to make the best of everyday he was granted to have.  Braxton lives on, he lives in your memories and in your heart.  He will never be too far away.  Big hugs to you all.  Rest Easy Braxton.
rip braxton he was a good kid 🕊🕊 he faught hard he will be missed he was a very good kid RIP 🕊🕊fly high little braxton
Dont be sad that he passed away be happy that he was born and got to have those memories FOREVER.♥

Oh Jake my heart breaks for you and his family, I did Children’s wish helping grant those wishes for several years. I’ve lost so many precious little ones. It’s so hard, your there for the best day of their lives and the worst day. Sending love ❤️ ❤️❤️ He will be searching for treasure in heaven, thank you for giving him his best day ❤️❤️❤️
I want you to know, in case you don't already! A year or so when you first met Braxton... The minute he, in person, laid eyes on you.... I can only imagine how much pain, suffering, trauma... All the doctors visits, the tests, the scans, the shots, the medicine.... The minute he laid eyes on you... Your gift as a human being completely erased every memory, every feeling, every emotion that little boy had gone through, due to his battle with cancer... There stood his hero! Braxton was tarnished by cancer, but when he met you, immediately,  he was polished! Shining, no thoughts or weight from the past, he was ready for the fight! I think from the second he was diagnosed, every single memory.... all the pain he went through, was completely erased!!! As you said... he was a tough boy! When you went back to see him at his home and gave him that Crystal... You did it again... And I imagine, in his little mind, he knew that things were different this time. What I hope you realize is that you were better than any pain medication, any treatment... You confirmed in that little boy's heart, that he had a true friend and that you cared enough to go see him again! He died knowing his hero truly cared about him and really was his friend!!! And to Braxton's parents.... Your son was an angel, a friend to everyone he met.... A kind soul, that warmed your heart when you were near him... Let your mind rest in peace next to Braxton, knowing that he was a complete reflection of your perfect parenting, and love... from day one till that last breath!
Bless you, Jake for making Braxtons dream come true. YOU MADE A DIFFERENCE.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Awesome video keep up the good work 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

REST IN PEACE Braxton
😢 wish you will Braxton 😭
I have heard a talk about "Lifting where you stand"  and you are a great example of that. You always lift peoples lives by your example. For you it may not feel like you've done anything major, but you  do things without asking anything in return. Jake may you continue to be such a great person and be stong enough to continue your work ethic.   Rest In Peace Braxton.
R.I.P
Rest In Peace Braxton

Praying for Braxton family, may he Rest In Peace.  Thank you Jake for making his wish come through, God Bless you for your loving and giving heart ❤️
Good to see you vulnerable. It isn’t comfortable, but this was not about you, it was about a sweet boy who left way too soon. Chin up, be proud for him. He is pain free in the arms of our Heavenly Father.
You don’t know how much you did for that kid Jake you made his dreams come true yes we will miss him but you should be proud of what you did for him and he will go to heaven with that memory still in his heart this is such a sad video but you should be so happy for what you have done
You were his greatest treasure of all brother RIP Braxton

May he rest in peace
🙏🏻😭
You are an amazing person.
How did he die?
Rest in peace
Jake...that you feel so deeply, is one of the things that makes you special. A couple of years ago, my community lost a very special boy named Jake to leukemia. He was diagnosed while going to the elementary school that I worked at. He lived every day to the fullest and his last wishes were modest. As much as it hurts to lose these special children, that come into our lives, we are so lucky to have known them. The lessons we learn from them are immeasurable and priceless. My thoughts are with Braxton's family and friends as I also continue to remember #teamjake .
R I P Braxton x😢

Rest In Peace Braxton
I'm so sorry to hear about Braxton. I understand your feelings. I had Lukima when I was (11-14) I was on of the older ones on the children's ward it was incredibly hard going thought that let alone watching all those younger children go through it, it was utterly heart breaking. You would often have long stays in the hospital and as Ireland is a small nation there was almost always two people a room on the ward. So you would often make have a room mate. I made good friends with a girl called Aiofe (Effa) she had a brain tumor and was 10 and we had a good bit in common. We would spend hours talking about having sleep over's when we got out and binge watch all the extended Lord of the rings movies with her favorite snack (Doritos!) , or debate who's dad snored the loudest as one parent would almost always stay the nights with us (her dad was the worst but I let her think it was mine as it made her so happy lol) We had so much fun planing what we would do when we got out of there.. A few months later I saw her at an event for children with caner. She was in a pram/ buggy at that stage and was so thin and pale and fail looking we still talked about what we would do when she was feeling better but you could tell that she had little energy left. I had thought she was just tired as the treatment can really take it out of you. Another few months later I was going into the ward to get meds and blood done. I ran into her mother and father. She had just passed on and they were finishing up on the ward with the staff. Her mom and dad thanked me for how much time I spent with her and effort I put into talking to her and for how happy I made her and joy I had brought them all and really helped her. At the time I was so numb I can only remember thinking.. But I didn't do anything, I was her friend..I only did what friends do, and we didn't even get to do what we planed, I shouldn't be thanked. My immune system was not good enough to go to her funeral and I never saw them again... It still hurt years later thinking on that amazing bubbly girl with buckets of personality and all we never got to do.. She was sadly one of many friends I lost in that period of time.  For what its worth I would say allow yourself to feel heal and processes. But also take joy form the fact that you got the privilege to know them and impact their life make them happy and they did the same for you. That in of itself is a gift we can often forget as we let the pain of what we think should have been take over. I am so great-full to Jesus who has healed me of the pain of the past and brought me through to the other side. I pray that he heals you and Braxton's family also form any hurt pain trauma and helps them to grieve in a way that would heal their souls and bless them. Knowing that he was a gift and that one day we will see them again in heaven as his children. My genuine condolences and prayers for you and especially Braxton's family, much Love  form Ireland <3

3:59 these are the moments in this world that bring any person who comes across them to their knees in tears. You changed a life, Jake. No matter how short it unfortunately was, Braxton got to do what he dreamed of doing. Fly high, little man, you fought as hard as you could, and in the end, we’re all so proud of you.   Also, props to you for using your platform and showing your love for this kid. Sometimes, MakeAWish events are a one time thing, but you made it a lot more than that. That alone means so much more than it could have. Way to go the extra mile.
R.I.P BRAXTON. you seem to be taking this pretty hard yourself, but remember, you planted one of the most cherishable and joyest memeroies into this angle's heart, of his life. every that saw that video saw the excitement and thanks in his face, be proud of that and rememder, he's in good hands now and thestruggle is over. thank you for taking his problems away from his mind for that day. not everyone can share that honor.
Feel for you mate. RIP young man
Aww rest in peace Braxton I'm so sad
Jake you are truly a gentlemen amongst people this was obviously a difficult video to make and you showed the raw emotion involved that couldn't have easy but you achieved so much more
What an honor to be in a position to inspire and make real dreams come true.
🙏🏽
Rest in peace little frend.
Good on You man. His struggles are over now.
RIP Braxton. May you have to happiest in Heaven and know you will always be loved and remembered. ❤❤❤
Praying for little Braxton and his family. Kickin' butt with two T's merch to raise more money for the fam?
Prayers out to his family. Remember that he god need him up in heaven. 😢
Rest in peace Braxton. Condolences to the Weidman family.
Rest In Peace Braxton.

Rest In Peace Braxton, you will be remembered forever and forever be immortalized through your videos Jake. May he forever soar behind the pearly gates and find peace.
Rest In Peace Braxton!,  Jake you were the perfect person to make his wish come true, you made his day when he got to be an amazing treasure hunter. Good thoughts going to Braxton’s family.

There's not much left to say, you did a good job, of doing a good thing, for a little kid who needed some time smiling.
Rest In Peace little guy🥺🕊

Rip Braxton you had a great heart you where so amazing
Rest in peace Lil dude I'm sorry for everyone's loss, I can see the pain and sadness in your face Jake sorry for the loss of your friend, I really don't know what to say, I'm just so sorry 👍🙏❤️
❤️❤️❤️
R.i.p little one ♡ Believe me he will be watching you find all the treasures! ♡
I am so so so sad I am praying for all of the people that knew him
I meant such
Very touching story
Rest in piece little Braxton 🙏
You are an amazing person and the impact you have is great. You gave a young kid the time of his life and I am sure his family is eternally grateful. You keep doing that thing you do! Thank you for being such a positive role model!
this world can make people very jaded and most of the time when you see a youtube person grow a huge audience, they lose some of the heart that made their channel so much fun to watch. how much Braxton means to you is evidence that we picked a great person to elevate into fame. you carry it with grace and authenticity. you made Braxton's short time on this earth better with what you were able to do for him and in return he opened your heart with his love and friendship. you are both heroic in my book.
Rip Braxton suck a cool kid your spirit will live on forever
Rip
❤️❤️
Thank you for sharing Braxton with us.  I feel honored to have been able to watch this incredible child living out his special wish with you.  You are such a good person to make sure Braxton had the most fantastic experience and cherished memories.  God Bless.
RIP Braxton
This is truly heartbreaking thank  you Jake for making his dream come true ❤️😭 Lots of love and support for you and the family
Rest In The Most Peaceful Sleep Braxton 🥺😇
RIP Baby Boy!!  You’re a good guy Jake. ❤️
Wow that's crazy to hear. Rest in peace Braxton and he is with Jesus right now in his kingdom. And we all need to take heart of this because we don't know when that day will come. If you are a believer in Jesus and have him in your heart that someday when that day comes we will be going to heaven praising God and having a celebration. Because we made it home to Jesus! God bless everybody and stay positive be happy and be you!😞🙏🏻

Fly 🕊️ Braxton
To Braxton’s family and Jake: There is no doubt in my mind that this little man was not only loved, but also full of love and energy! There is also no doubt in my mind that Braxton was taught to want for nothing but love. There is no doubt in the short time God you with Braxton, you did an amazing job, Mom and Dad. Jake: your response to his passing shows your character and passion for service and people. RIP Braxton! You will definitely be missed!
Thanks you for your time and humanity
I’m so sorry he seemed like an amazing kid
I'm praying for his family, Braxton may all the angels guide you in you adventures. Rest gently.

Fly high young man 💙 may you rest in peace
Thank you for sharing this and for your devotion to Braxton. Kids are so innocent and deserve the treasure of LOVE. Clearly you have given him both treasures. God bless you and Braxton's family. What a perfectly lovely boy. 😪🙏
Rest In Peace Braxton. So sad ☹️
As a mom, I can’t begin to imagine the suffering his parents have endured. My deepest sympathies to them. Granting Braxton’s wish had a bigger impact than just one day, it brought awareness to all the millions who watched of how severe the battle of childhood cancer truly is. The numbers are growing every year, we really need to find a cure.
To the family may God comfort you all now and always. God bless you guys. He’s looking in Jesus face and smiling ear to ear. Don’t even doubt that he’s ok. Jesus won’t let anything hurt him ever again. May you find peace and love in Gods comfort.
R.I.P Braxton you will truly be missed buddy

May Braxton rest in peace and I want to send my love to his family and hope that they can find their way through the pain.  I have two sons with terminal brain cancer but they are both adult men.  One is 42 and the other is 31.  They both have children of their own now but it never gets easier to know that this horrid disease will someday take them from all of us who love them so very much.
Nnoo is it dream😞
i'm sorry for you jake and to braxton's family and mainly to you braxton if i could i would switch places between us so that you could live the life you deserved i don't work for what i get and i'm sometimes greedy and i don't think that it is right for us to be like me and be sometimes greedy with somethings and not be respectful to those of us around us we need to show our respect and honor to braxton, jake, and the weidmans for the loss of braxton. braxton was a kind and cheerful little kid and i don't think it should've been him to go. we love you and we miss your bright lighted spirit braxton may you and your soul rest in peace. we honor you today braxton. we love you
Rest In Peace Braxton. This has broke my heart today  This world is a cold one for real tho 😢😭😭
RIP little man 🙏 you're a true fighter ♥️

The joy and happiness he experienced before he passed will be set in the Heavens forever. I'm sure he's bragging about it to God right now. You're a blessing Jake. Braxton loved you like all get out. He thought the world of you and was stoked to be with you. Take comfort hun. God is comforting and healing you as well. Read the prayer that I sent his family. I pray this for you too.

Rest In Peace Braxton kick butt with 2 t,s
Dallmyed I know how you buddy, but I want you to know something. Braxton will always be watching over you!
It takes a man to cry but a legend to talk about it. Especially in front of 1 mil+ people. You rock Jake
we can have a bad day together.....
He’s such a nice person. You can see how hard it is for him even without knowing him for a long time. Best wishes to the family.
Damn shame there are kids his age not waking up in the morning dying from hunger and all sorts as well. It's just a cruel world sometimes and we are forced to look on the bright side of life but we are very very far from human dignity and human rights for all. governments showing a lack of empathy, compassion and kindness.
Rest in peace Braxton
Jake, you’ve touched so many peoples lives, big and small. What an honor for him to choose you and have both of you leave imprints on each other’s hearts. I know he will be with you for the rest of your life, never stop thinking about him. RIP Braxton.
REST IN PEICE. I hope he has a good time in heaven he was good and strong kid
hi jake i just want you to know it takes a very special type of person to do what you did for braxton and his family and you are a very special type of person i know it hurts but please don't stop doing it please keep your heart open and willing to the possibility of another wish request my heart goes out to braxton's entire family rest in peace braxton i hope your next life is a billion times better

I so sorry R.i.p. Braxton
Jake ,  I watched your video where you partnered with the famous treasure hunter Braxton .  Yes he was young but already very accomplished and you both had a ball and he was so stoked to be with you , you could see it .  August 31 2018 my wife won her 20 some year fight with breast cancer and went home to the Lord .  When I saw you with Braxton that just warmed my heart . His zest for what he was doing was contagious .  That little warrior was so true to life .  As soon as you started the video this time I for some reason just started to cry I just seemed to know .  His family are hurting and need to know that for all you did for him he will be watching over you  ,  I know the pain of their being gone but it does get better  though it still hurts . Remember them and the good times .  I really am so sorry for the loss of that Brave little warrior he is fantastic  .  Rest In Peace little warrior you will be missed  !...!...!
So sorry Jake I know he lent a lot to you and his family
Braxton wanted us to kick buTT instead of saying ‘buT’ and making excuses. That’s my new mantra. Our deepest condolences to Braxton’s family, and all who knew him. Thanks also for showing the impact of MAW, Jake.
Rest easy Braxton. Keep kicking butt with 2 Ts.
So sad. Praying for the family.
R.I.P. braxton I feel so sorry for u and the family to go through that is so hard
You will always be remembered Braxton!! Rest In Peace 😭 🕊

OH, the treasures that await you, little buddy!! Rest in peace❤️
Jake I just wanted to say that you are just a GREAT person for doing what you do.  I don’t watch your videos because I’m in to scuba diving or hunting for crystals.  I watch just because you always seem to be having the time of your life.  You’re one of the lucky ones that is successful in YouTube and get to do the things you really want to.  You keep that positive attitude going and I’m sure others will get so much joy in watching you just be Jake!!!  What an honor it must have been to be chosen for someone’s Make a Wish!!  It must really mean the world to you. Keep being you and keep kickin’ butt with two T’s.
rest in peace Braxton..he has big dream like u jake

My deepest love to you all....:(
And Jake, i am absolutely nobody. But thank you for making this kid smile when you had the opportunity. You earned my respect and a loyal fan for life.
Ah dang thats sucks so bad 😭😭😭😭
Braxton rest easy little fella, we’ll be kicking butt’s with 2 T’s. Watch over your loved ones until you reunite.
God is running out of angels and he needed Braxton!!!!
Rip buddy
There’s so much strength in this video. Strength from Braxton’s family for sharing their son’s story. Strength from Jake for showing raw emotion and vulnerability on camera. Strength in the make a wish foundation for continuing to fight against the pain that illnesses cause. This was beautiful to watch. Sending much love to Braxton’s family and everyone involved with this project ❤️
Not only you, but his family will treasure the memories you made together, and as difficult as this was to tape and post, they will find comfort in your unselfish acts of love. I have buried a son, and i know first hand what it feels like. The parents will never be able to heal the hole in their hearts that Braxton filled, but they will find comfort and peace because of people like you,  who are not afraid to step up and be there in the most difficult of times.  Many hugs and much love to you.  YOU are the treasure.
☹️

Rest easy little Buddy. My condolences to his friends and family.
Damn.
Heaven gained another Angel, and Im glad he chose you because you are an awesome example to these kids. Prayers for the family and friends.
A message for the the family, There’s a quote by my favorite author, Joseph Campbell, and it goes like this: “Find a place inside where there’s joy, and the joy will burn out the pain.”  Don't let this loss keep you down, instead be thankful for the time you spent together. An smile knowing he's at peace.
I know exactly how y’all feel. I lost my daughter to neuroblastoma in 2006. It is a loss that no one should ever have to experience. My heart goes out to you Jake and to Braxton and his family. I will always cherish the 2 years I had with my daughter. The wound never really heals, we just learn to cope with the pain. I pray that the time you had with Braxton is never forgotten.
Damn
He will be treasure hunting in heaven.
Rest In Peace Braxton 💔
Rest In Peace to the poor little guy😭
Dang dude what a hard video to make. You made his dreams come true, brother. This just shows how fragile life is. Take advantage of what we have and live life to the fullest. Not time for fighting. Take care bud.
How amazing that you were able to make such an incredible impact in the life of a boy you would have never met had you not started your channel. You do make a difference in the life of many people, especially Braxton.
Rest in peace braxton 🥀

Rest In Peace Braxton 🥺😢
What a beautiful thing to share with Braxton and his family. Such an honour to be chosen by him ... But I think anyone who watches you understands why. Braxton will be keeping a close eye on your adventures I'm sure 💗 I put rose quartz into my aunts coffin and gave same stone  to my sister and mom while we spend time with her at her wake. For me it was a symbol of love 💗 Braxton having your crystal with him is just so so special 💗 huge virtual hugs.
Rest In Peace Braxton.
I am so sorry
He saw you helped people and genuinely was having fun doing what you love so I’m happy for him. He got to hang with a cool guy 🦋  Rest In Peace Braxton 💙

I live with a debilitating disease and if I had the ability to hang out with a utuber it would definitely be you. God Bless you kiddo you do good!!

Rest in peace, sweet Braxton.  Prayers for the Weidman family.
Your such a great person Jake and I wish I could have met Braxton. He seemed like a good kid.
Awe man your a great person! Rest In Peace young treasure hunter.
What a tremendous litter warrior 😔
It's so sad when children pass away.  So sorry for their loss.
Rest In Peace. Hope you fly high little Braxton. 👼
That was tough... Tough to watch, to learn about the passing of Braxton, the pain of losing a loved one, and the impact he has made on so many people. It's always the hardest to comprehend when it comes to the innocent. I am thankful that you accepted the request to fulfill his wish, tell us his story, included his family, and allowing us to learn of his completion on this Earth. To go back and see him again later on, and to make another video afterwards shows the content of your character, and earns a huge ton of respect from a lot of people. At least everyone will have the video to watch one of his best days ever! Never forgotten...
Rest in peace Braxton.
Hi Jake I am sorry to you I watch that vid a month ago and I was braking my hard just now x
Fly high Braxton
Rest in peace Braxton 🙏. We hope you are happy in God's arms. You will always be remembered.

Every man is given a chance to live, but very few are given the choice in how they die, and even fewer are able to choose how they are remembered. Thanks to you and your kind heart, he will be remembered not as a boy with cancer, but as a strong young man who held his head high.
Rest In Peace Braxton💛
My thoughts and prayers are with the Weidman family. Braxton will never be forgotten...what a sweet little boy! ❤️ Jake you really have a heart of gold. Just know that you gave him a day that he and his family will always remember. ❤️ For you to set that up is amazing and also know that all the treasures you both put in the treasure case.

R. I. P Braxton. X
Rest in peace Braxton
RIP Braxton. a life truly taken too soon. shows that you are so beyond special jake. thank you for all you do.
i have lost a cat 3 snails a fish and all of them I cried a lot they where my best friends but a kid I cant that must have been... well... rip
Have a great big time in Heaven Braxton. BTW, I hear the streets are made of gold and there is a crystal river. Go exploring.
World is unfair....Soo many bad thugs is walking on the streets and this soo young kid just pass away for nothing, inocent boy...I start crying so bad
he was so young 😥
I just wish there was an emergency tissue box that was in our daily supplies for videos like this.
Weidman Family- as a mother, my heart breaks. I cannot imagine and I wish I could take this pain from you. There’s really never anything meaningful you can say in these situations. We are experiencing a fraction of your pain but maybe knowing he will live on forever here on YouTube will bring you some comfort. Sounds silly but now he is a part of all our lives just from the videos. I’ll tell my mama to give him a big hug for you guys up above. ♥️ Jake- Thank you for being raw and not cutting out the emotional parts. My heart is saddened and I wish comfort for you and his family. I appreciate that you see what an honor it was to have him choose you to be his life adventure, not just when he came to see you but watching your videos throughout his life.
Rest In Peace Braxton.  Go Kick butt with two T's young man.   Jake what you did for Braxton and his family and what you are doing for them now will stay in theirs and your hearts for a long, long time.  Stay strong.
Rest In peace Braxton, you will be remembered.
You made his wish come true and you didn't just finish that day and walk off. You went far and above by keeping in touch with him. Always remember that he is now well and in no more pain and you will see him again some day. To you it will be years but for him it will only be a blink of an eye,  he won't have time to miss anyone before he is reunited with his family and friends. May God bless you for being such a kind and loving person.
Rest in Heaven Braxton
May all of our memories be remembered of Braxton. Rest in peace Braxton, we'll miss you.
Rip
😥
Make a Wish helps make grownups realize what’s really important in life. Braxton RIP.
😭😭 big sad 😭😭😭
RIP Braxton
Man you know Braxton was the first one to watch and like this video. He's having the time of his life with the good lord treasure hunting finding the best finds anyone could ask for. My condolences to his family and anyone else affected by his passing. And of course Jake.. these are the things in life that humble you and that you'll cherish for the rest of your life. For everyone out there keep kicking butt with 2 t's just like Braxton did.
Jake I am so humbled and impressed by your transparency and compassion. Thank you for honoring this young man and supporting his family during this tragic time.
That kid was a fighter that was probably your best video I can't talk anymore I'm bowling 😭😭😭😭 my eyes out
Rest easy little man.  Your fight is over but ours is not.  One day we’ll be able to say we beat cancer and kicked it’s butt (with two T’s).  God bless.
Damn man making me cry 😢...your a good man Jake, that was super cool of you, and his family appreciates what you did, and im sure that little man thought of that trip before he held hands with god. Your a good man
It’s hard when it’s a child. My daughter had a best friend who passed when they were 9. He was an awesome kid who just happened to have leukemia. He lived to make her happy. She wanted a turtle but I couldn’t find one of the small turtles that you can get at the pet store. They’re illegal here. He went to the river and found her a turtle. Turns out it was a snapping turtle. It was a baby so we kept it for a while then released it. That was her goodbye to him. So I understand. It hurts.
Rest in peace, Braxton. Condolences to you and his family. Sending prayers of comfort. ❤❤🙏🏼🙏🏼
I just wanted to let you know I donated $150 and there wasn't an option to let you know I care and my heart goes out to you and Braxton's family. God bless and thank you for all you do Jake. And know that you do make a difference in this world so thank you!
Rest in peace Braxton. You will be missed.
Braxton you may have only been on this earth for a little but you’ve made an impact to last a lifetime. May you Rest In Peace ❤️❤️  I hope you hit those gold streets on two wheels Hope your mansion in the sky's got a ten-acre field With some mud and some hubs you can lock in Make some thunder, make 'em wonder how you got in Hide your beer, hide your clear from the man upstairs Crank it loud, hold it down 'til I get there And when I do I hope you got some new stories to tell 'Til then, give heaven some hell
You did a great thing just think when he tells the maker about how much fun he had with you. Thank you for all you do. 🙏 God bless his family and yours 🙌
This really hit home! The tears just keep coming out. What a great guy you are jake! My condolences to Weidman family! May you Rest In Peace Braxton buddy! 🙏❤️
RIP Braxton
God bless you all 💜💜💜

Rest easy buddy. We’ll all be together soon!
i'm just happy that jake is giving the wiedman sorry if i mispelled the name but i'm just in shock that he would instead of donating the money to charity i love how he is giving the money to braxton's family. it is so inspirational that you would do something like this even when we know it physically hurts you on the inside. we love and miss you braxton and we love the bright light and the bright aura that you had where ever you went. we love and miss you braxton may you and your soul rest in peace see you in heaven man love and miss you rest in peace🤟😭👑🔥

You're a real one Jake. Imagine, you started a channel to share your world with people and look how much you mean to them? I bet Braxton had the time of his life with you and he couldn't have been with anyone better.
Jake you are truly a humble and kind person with a huge heart. Your heartbreak is honest and felt.  I’m so sorry to you, his family and friends. He was far too young to go through such a battle. He was so brave. Rest well Braxton.❤️

Jake, thank you for letting us know. Seems like he got to meet his hero. With our actions in life, you never know who is watching or who is listening. That's why all of us should make a decision to be that of good influence and not of bad. And Jake, you deserved to meet Braxton, just the same as he deserved to meet you ❤️  rip, sweet Braxton, who touched so many hearts.
R.I.P Braxton... out of all the videos you have made that video hit me the most...   F**K CANCER

You did really good man, proud of you. You gave him an amazing experience he and his family will never forget.
It was one of my favorite videos of yours. Jake you are such a great guy. I love watching all of your videos but this video of you and Braxton was the best you put a big smile on his face. ❤️
I shared that video everywhere I could when you published it.. To see this update hurts. He was so down to earth, so excited to do something so simple like hanging out with you. Just shows how much of an impact you have on others. Never forget how many folks you reach even if your videos seem silly fun. We make impacts on people everyday.
RIP Braxton, we will remember you
😢🥺💔
Sorry for the loss of this amazing young man. He is one of Gods angels looking down. Rest In Peace Braxton!
Prayers go out to his family. 🤍🕊
It is so hard to lose someone you care for. It’s Ok to cry.  Just always remember the joy he got from meeting you.

Rest in peace Braxton we will remember you and have u in our hearts. He always be a best buddy to you on make-a-wish. Thanks u for being his buddy and be there for him I'm sending my prayers
Hey man you got to be that kids big brother his awesome friend till the end. Love your passion for this and passion for helping. Stay strong man.
You made his dream come true. It is going to be ok. We will always remember him.
Hey man... atleast you made that kids LIFE keep it up!  Edit: 4:00 killed me
Much love for his family💗
Oh my God.  Buddy, I know it hurts, but you made that boys dream come true.  Its always important to remember that its never a goodbye, but a see ya later.  He can now free dive and explore unhindered.  He's finding you all sorts of crystals and nodes to share with you when you see him again.    We have to remember that folks like Braxton can teach us all valuable lessons.  They show us how fragile life is.  Just how short the time we spend here is and can be even shorter.    They teach us that taking time for the things that really matter is what life's all about.  They also teach us a large lesson on humility.     People like Braxton punch these things straight in the mouth when a lot of us would fold and let it take hold much quicker.   It makes it hurt worse when they do pass because theyre fighters and it makes it tough because they leave so early.     Rest in peace, Braxton.
We all feel the same Jake, wishing the best for you, Braxton (Rest in Peace ❤️), his family and friends ❤️❤️ Fly high Braxton ❤️
Your day for a man you different god bless you man God will keep him safe
R.I.P Braxton

Everyone kept saying how I was your hero and how I positively affected your life, but you did that to me ten fold. You've inspired me to live the best life I can. You're family said green was your favorite color, so I wore green for you at your funeral. Save some treasure up in heaven for me! We miss you bud. Lets live our lives "Kicking Butt With Two T's" just like Braxton!   You can directly donate to Braxton's family with my link provided here: https://bit.ly/BraxtonWeidman  If you would like to take it to the next level feel free to donate to Make-A-Wish Foundation and help their amazing cause.
