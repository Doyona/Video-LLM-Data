When somebody in Pwr calls u good
Seeing how many subs I can get from a comment.... Pls subscribe to me and the PWR team

*Hey, to you reading*..... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
we need a part 2
Lachy
John 3:16-17 16- For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17- For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23- For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9- That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10- For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
Muz and Chanzes killed the duo that killed Lachy
Serum SRM ^^^^^

Lachlan! We have the best graphics and FPS in the world Me: i thought they have the best graphics and fps?  Me after 3 minutes Ohh I have 480p on 🤐🤐🤐😅😅😅
The graphics suck
RADIUSSS
Pls do a locker skin vs icon in like a box fight and zone war
Radius
LMAO Vindooly playing comp for the first time is hilarious
Damn muz is a DEMON
i have the elf, verge, and actual lachlan skin. i just realized
My favorite player is worthy
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
did chanzes say LAYMA??? 3:34 lol

Nuvidia
Fortnite:Stream sniping Ban!Ban!Ban! PWR:What?
Where was repulse
Nice vid
Lachy and radius
Come on Lachlan
What happened to repulse
The thumbnail is clickbait where is repulse
is it just me or is chanzes laggy
I got the Lachlan skin when it was out
Chanzes takes the dub
I wish I could be in one of those games because lachy is my fav content creator soz every one els
Ok
Tbh if Radius and Lachlan got a good start they would have ezly won
The game looks doo doo lmao
Pick up volx
Muz: it must be lachy under us  Me : lachy is dead
ggs!
Why do they have mobile graphics it kills my eyes.
i say lachy and radius are gonna take the dub 10 secs later: lachy dies nvm
They are playing on 12 times my fps :(
PWR X2Twins
Where is PWR Repulse
When you realise u have more arena points than vindooly.😀😀
12:31 “what does tarping mean” lol😂😂
Lachlan you are my favorite Youtuber can you plz play Fortnite with me  My Fortnite name : PWR I love Anja PWR is of you :) Anja is my girlfriend :)
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS
Who's from lachys stream
What how is it duo area. Duo area got vaulted it might of been recorded before it was vaulted
How can i join power?
to me mitch's game was so choppy but he had 300 fps
The four frail alligator interspecifically snow because pastor reassembly tow without a hesitant fur.  freezing, internal fan
chanzes screen is trash
My boy lachy will always win
PWR!!!
Chanzes And Muz avenged Lachy And Radius.
Does anybody wonder why repulse left team pwr
Lachy
overstraand ftw
You should do Fortnite Friday power tho
Why is lachy using performance mode!?
PWR is full of Power.
Use code PWR 🙏🔥🔥
Why is chanzes fps sf bad bro?
Why is Asia the WORST place to be on when it comes to Fortnite?
Cool
“What does tarping mean?” 🤣🤣
Lachlan
where is repulse lol
Lachlan and radios
This video was honestly fun 😁
I think lachy and radius are gonna win bc there my favorite pwr member
1:40 song?
Is repulse still in pwr?
When PWR gets famous, we can say that we’re ogs
hi pwr
triggers me how chanzes has his recording software capped on like 45 - 50fps
Ok cool
Lachy wins obv
Nice video man!
hi
Do more video like this
Is worthy epic name PWR worthy cos if it is he killed us
I am 7 and I watch ur videoes everyday.
Best PWR vid yet
I love vindooly
do factions like so he can see
hits him for 27 shields (cracked )
Worty a beast he friends didn’t know anything no hate
This shouldn't have been done in arena. I know it made it easier for matchmaking but the content creators seemed to struggle a lot as there were a lot of good other players
Yo when guys telling people that mau is pwr
Where was repulse
Can we just respect the editor for making unbelievable videos for us to watch we respect you
Lol it's N-vidia not Navidia
We killed lachy
You should do a pwr live stream and switch screens like x2 twins do
Vindooly:what does con mean huh? Worthy:umm contested  Vindooly again:what does tarping mean mm? Worthy: umm building a layer   Me: dying to laughter
Love the PWR team and graphics look amazing!
I hate how underrated OCE is. This team helps OCE shine and stand out. Keep doing what you're doing and continue to try and become the best.
Ngl i tought Lachy and Radius were gonna win but gg
Next up: Full PROAM with the PWR bois VS OCE talent, full 100 lobbies 👀
Why is vindooly using Apple earbuds lol 😂
Me: Looking at FPS
Not watching it yet but I think radius is gonna carry lachy
Lachaln: one sweat Everyone: we all know who that is Everyone: looks at lachlan  Lachlan: me?
Now this is Poggs!
Hope lachlan wins!
Wait who’s is Lachlan and radius both pro players
Overstrand has more arena points than Lachy and Chanzes. He goated
Hi @PWR and OG’s
I had to make sure that this was a real video 😂😂😂
All of these players are actually insane, hope to be like them one day 🤞🏼
The bitter share puzzlingly refuse because sycamore technologically chop over a striped archer. best, cooperative bicycle
Why was the storm so clear for muz
windily and  worthy
Lol I was LXST shinx one of the fish stick
Everyone... Repulse....
Lachlans team wins for sure
Lachlan and Radius win for sure
I wonder who is the best in PWR
What about repulse and lunar?
Can u plz play rocket league
I wish console had performance mode
GG's Only!
how come there storms are so clear and see-trough!?
They were promoting the new graphics tho it looks like hot trash especially in storm
Is it.me or does chanzes (idk) game looks worse then the others
Why is Muzs storm see through and Chanzes is so dark
lachlan technically you are a pro player, well all of you guys are because lachlan created an actual org
Vindooly the goat bro 😂
How did they get in the same game together for Area?
Lachlen radious is better than u
Hi lachy
Of course Lachlan will win
I really loved the vid keep it up PWR. I hope you do another one like this but with everyone in endgame. Good Luck and Thanks
Gg
I thought con meant condition
Let's gooo. I wanted Worthy and Vindooly to win because they are both so wholesome and Vindooly isn't so good. Glad to see the PWR boys dominating though with the 360 hz monitors.
Whats con?
This is so amazing do more please I really loved watching this please do more
Another BANGER🔥🔥🔥
That thumbnail looked  like the x2twins thumbnail. Lowkey
Hello
lachlen  and radius is my bet
Thx to the people who found this early god bless you and gustins crakes man
chanzes sounds like a robot in the recording
Low key want another PWR Fortnite Olympics
My friend Justin heys already taken and he’s cracked at fortenite my guy aaaaaaa
Hi
Great vid guys your my favourite clan keep up the best content. :)
Why des Chanzez’s recording look like 30 fps but it says 300 fps?
Love the video with all the pros and content creators more of the in creative  PWR up baby ⚡️
why did repulse leave for spg
Imagine not being subscribed
lachlan
you should do it again
We all knew worthy would win 😂 although chanzes and Muz gave them a good run for their money and I think they were the most coordinated team. Great content and happy to see the pros getting involved. Also what’s with Looter? He’s so chill at the moment! Normally he’s screaming all the time lol
You guys should do a fast and furious game mode where its teams of 2 and you have one driver and one gunner
Can you do a part two with the same teams
Worthy cracked
Is radius the pro
How can I join
Vin you the man. You helped worthy all the way to the dub. You sacrificed yourself, but it was a sacrifice for the the dub. Lets goooo!
Love when Lachy is in the videos
Vin is definitely the best fortnite player
Did repulsegod leave team power?
Best to worst in my opinion PWR members worthy , radius , looter , muz , chanzes , Lachy  , the guy with looter and then vindooly sorry vindooly
Lachy and radius
Vin is like the six yr old in a group of high schoolers asking about everything they are saying 😂
I think Lachlan and Radius
Cant wait till my pc and moniter slap like the ones on the video
Lachlan
I know fresh is with a different team but was he ever offered a spot in PWR
11:02 theres a duck
About time
I think lachy and radius are gonna win cause they cracked
When Lachy and Radius have been dead the whole game but no one saw the kill feed.....
Where is Repulse??
You got this Lachy
And remember get pwr merch.
Next time you do this you be on solos. I think that live it up little bit more.
Bro Worthy, Lachy and Vindooly r my favorite but I still like the others
I think Lachlan and radius
Lachy
Lachy and radius for the win.
Hi lacy daucky
Larhan
wheres repulse
Lachy and radius gonna win
Bruh vindooly uses Apple earbuds to play
Over strand and looter should win cause overstrand is cracked at fortnite my guy
I mean Lachy is going to win
I think Radius is gonna win
3:33 was it just me who thought that was a launch pad
Did repulse leave pwr he hasn't been in videos for a while
What happened to puck and after
Where is Repluse God?
Lach
It sucks to be the innocent 92 players who had one of the best players in the world destroying everyone
I always wonder what had happed to repulse
I'm guessing Muz and Chanzes won this.
R.i.p arena duos
Where is repulse
Why dose vindooly looks like he would be Tessa AKA fresh is girlfriend ???
Where’s repulse?
You can tell that this video is going to be a banger for two reasons. 1st - because it was made by PWR . 2nd - because of the way lachy introduced the teams it felt  like a brand new trailer for an amazing movie
Anyone else really wish they did multiple games? It was over so fast 😔 Great vid tho!!! 👍
Can I join PWR ( subscribe to Tetchy skate) and PWR
I love pwr
Did repulse leave pwr
that moment when Mitch is still recording in 30fps
we need more like this!!
Muz and Chanzes absolutely made those Twitter kids look like floppers
6:14
I actually clapped at the end of the video you guys need to make a part 2 of this lol
Do a kill race but in duos or trios
The game is so smooth. chancez gameplay 😬😬
Vin: WhAtS tArPiNg AnD cOn MeAn?
Wow this was cool. You should do more of these
https://youtu.be/-M7gSL-kpqU
worthy and vin or lachy and radius
Where’s repulse😔
Lachlan hasn’t been in a pwr video in a minute
Thank you lachy for all the great content these years keep it up!
Worthy team
gg
Can we just say that repulse isn't there but the other eight of them are
me thinking cuddle pool was for the ai's vindooly doing double edits ok nvm
I haven’t finished the video but I’m calling worthy wins. Worthy is a goat
Looter?
I hope you
lachlan going to win
Of course Lachy got Radius 😂
What does con mean that got me
At 1:34 and think that ,muz and chanzes or vindooly and worthy could win
Yay they should do stuff in creative more
Black
I laughed so hard when they thought radius and lachy were still in
what happened to repulse
lachlan wins
PWR Member: *Gets Into Fight*  PWR Member: “I think it’s one of the boys!”
Pls to box fights
I spend most of my time in „Recording“,“Editing“,“uploading“, but no one supports me 💔 I need all my brothers and sisters support 🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭😭😭😭
#pwr house
Looter sounds so different
Lachlan was good
Were is repulse, also you should recruit fresh and if u do pwr would be to op
I’m on the grind to 100 subs I am at 60 right now let’s see how many I can get off this comment pls
Is it funny that muz killed the guy who killed worthy and lachy
Who I want to win: Lachy  Who I think will win: Chanzes
Definately Lachy and Radius You know the boys 🔥❤️
DO THIS AGAIN
This video was pog
At 6:02 imagine being those little nerds then watching this video
Over strand and looter
I think Lachy is gonna win
300k for 1 mil bois!!
can u do in other one next season please
We want a part 2!!
360Hz really changing the game though...
Why is chanzes screen so glitchy?
Have u noticed all the content creators have face cam and the pro plays don't
whats tarping is the new "whats 90s"  a new generation of lachy
Im for radius and lachy because radius makes the best montages and lachy has nice vids
Lachy and radius
chanzes and muz is my bet
CHANZES mic is echoing and it fells laggy his game play sorry to be a downer just he should get a new one
what is that graphics ewww the water
What is wrong with chases computer
epic video
You should have a PWR creative house build off where you give the creative team 24 hrs to build a house
Thank for the pc knowledge I am impressed by it let’s go it’s sick
Can you heart my comment 💜
vindooly and worthy will win
lachlan and  radius will win
Bro this video was amazing, I have been subbed since the very beginning of pwr can’t wait to see you grow even more
cheese
Wish to see a 4v4 of this😁
oof
Poor repulse he got left out
LOOTER DEAD - BEST OF CHANZES 2021
Damn all face reveals
Idk why everyone is saying worthy carried vindooly. Vindooly easily carried worthy lol.
What happened to repulsegod, did he leave PWR ?
Lachy
This is the best video ever this deserves so much love
Lachy and radius
Anyone here like right after pwr changed the title?
Yo
Nice
lachlan and radius  will win
what happened to repulse
Lachy radius
i love these vids
Wow this is amazing you guys are sick
muz and mich
Evreyone was saying that Lachlan was in the game the whole time lol
The monitor looks so good in the storm
looter
This just shows how worthy is legit goated
Getting famous off comments day 20, so I can live the dream life. Everyday like it’s your last day🤙
favorites are definitely radius and looter
Funny how for a PWR video the first ad i saw was about NRG clix in proguids lol
I would have liked to see more than one game. Such a big hype up for a 14 minute video...
They left out repulse
Do the same thing in custom matchmaking with only your teams and no other players
0:19 vor.in.net
Why does chanzes sound so weird at 4:51
I think worthy or radius is gonna win
Only og’s remember when the title was The PWR Fortnite Pro AM
Vindoly carried hard
Me thinking lachy and radius got this    Random team : think again
Man chnzes gave me a massive headache 😭😭
Chanzez and Muz
Are we sure Muz wasn't the pro?
My money pregame is on worthy, Ik vin is not too good but worthy carries anyone content creator here hard
I wish that I can join pwr
#PWRUP
Where was repulse man
i remember when u played strucid in roblox u should play it with the whole pwr team
i’m convinced vindooly has never played this game
Worthy carried so hard with a guy that didn’t know what tarping or conned means jk love u vin
Hi hue fan really want to try out pleeeeeeaaaaasssseeeee nae CDHMustang
The storm looked so good with the new gpus and everything. It was clean.

I live that they got a graphics sponsor, and they said it's beautiful, while it looks like a potato.
Looter team
Rip overstrand and looter lol
11:22 he killed lachys team
POG POG POG
Saying this before the video btw I swear lachy and radius were duo partners If they dont win I'm just saying....

Repulse : I think pwr I a good way to use my skills. : 2 weeks later left
123
Hi

Fun Fact: the skin radius is wearing hasn't came to the store in over a year.
I have been watching you for like two years I love your vids I use creator code Lachy to support u by the way
Hi
anyone else finding chanzes’s gameplay a bit laggy
Tell me Radius doesn't look like an elf

I actually think that Lachlan and Radius would DESTROY!!
Firet
Nice on
Love the vids but where's repulse
I think Lachlan and Radius will win
Epic...
Petition, to get the X2 Twins in PWR
PWR is the only thing keeping me going in quarantine

Imagine being in their game and killing them.
