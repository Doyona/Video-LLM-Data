Shoulda said “zero”

They should’ve said “Zero”
Yassssss Karl!
jgyg
both say hi is the easiest
no way I actually said Shoelace
I'd point at my shoe and nod. Then say umbrella.
Man they dumb they could’ve said zero at the same time
Banana.
always banana
Tomato🍅!
They should’ve just told eachother the word they were gonna say cuz mrbeast never said they couldn’t
They should’ve just said word
personally i probably would’ve said “zero”
They should’ve nodded at each other and said yes
I would have said the P word
I said cheese
THE JUST HAD TO SAY “HI”
Should have communicated about the word in the five seconds
Should’ve said go
Meow 😸
I thought they were gonna say cheese burger
meow
Bruh meme gang

Hi mrbEAST
they should have said the most common word"hi"
Meow
Yeet
Before the 5 seconds ended I would have problably tell the other person the word I was gonna say
Why didn’t they just tell each other to say the same word
I thought they were gonna say word
I thought they would say zero
0:09vmeow

Chris: MeWo
I'm shocked carl didn't say *YEEEEEHAWWWWW*
*MEOW*
Chris said shoelace in cat language and Karl said meow in shoelace language?
I thought they were both gonna say zero

The guy on the right is kinda cute
Jello
Ya know he didn't say you couldn't tell each other what you were gonna say
They’re just weird
I thought karl was boutta say ratatouille
They should have said zero
I would’ve said word
The exact same word.
There were no rules against speaking before the 5 seconds was up...
Please mr beast can you sponsor me to help students for educational purposes. ???? ..
They could have just said "the exact same word"
Donit
69
Op criss jimmy salute you
One of them should have just held up 2 fingers and mouthed the word “two” and then they both say “two”.

I love that they did three bids  in the same day
Idk what to comment
Me and my BROTHER love your show
anyone else think of apple ? just me? ok

karl be emo now - sora 2022
👍🏻 describe
But what they should have said was “shop mrbeast”
Hi
oof
They Could've Just Said Jinx
I was thinking coconuts 💀💀
Meow
Why did i expect both to say 'butt'
The could have just said 0
Wy don’t they do subscribe
I thought Karl and Chris will say at least this word: Jimmy
They had about 5 seconds to tell eachother what to say 🤣
Chris: meow
I thought they would say zero
Should’ve said same word lol
"the exact same word"... do I win?!?!
Chris should've pointed at his shirt
Same Word : Mrbeast👈
I’d say the, decent chance
Chris did want to say the same word though
Lol I was thinking of beast
What random words, where did you get Meow from Chris!
chris said shoelace but in cat language
Meow and shoelace are far beyond random out of everything in the world  I'd of immediately gone to either subscribe or same word
I thought he was gonna point at something so they can both say it's name.
I was assuming they would both say “subscribe”. It was the best choice
cool
i wouldve said yes
communication is key boys communication is key
I expected they would both say subscribe
Jimmy can you say happy birthday to my friend Jayden
i would said literally said the same word
Why didn’t they just tell each other the word they should say
I Expected them to say 0.
I am so offended they didn't say antidisestablishmentariunisn
I'd have said "zero"
Sus
The easiest word would be subscribe or just say hello/hi
Dude i can’t stop watching this 😂😂😂
Chris =🐱😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Meow sandwich
I was surprised karl didn't say "sapnap and Quackity are hot"
Do this but with twins
Love you bro from Pakistan 😍😍😍🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
i would have just said chandler or chris
They should have said “the same word”
I love how Karl throws Chris’s hat
Maw
Bruh meme
there was a 0.0006% chance so no
Alt universe: they say the same word by discussing what they were going to say since Jimmy didn't exactly say they couldn't 🤤
"Exact same word" how easy is that.
I would have said hi or hello
I would say "0"
Shoelace
Meow
小さい頃よく親が車の中で流してた曲でなんも分からないまま聞いてたけど。めちゃくちゃいい曲で感動した
Hehe
Okay but why was I thinking that Chris was gonna say meow and I was correct-
I'd have said money
Chris: meow
I would have Said money
I would point at something and hopefully he gets it
Wow
They should have said subscribe lol
they should have said " *THE EXACT SAME WORD* " and they won
Mine would be OP. Mine would be teri maki chut. It’s all one word when translated
They should say 10 grand
I would hit his leg then say ow
Just say Mr beast
Say Never Gona Give You Up...
Lol😂
Love you so so so so so much Karl and Chris
I woulda said "Zero"
Meow
They both looked at the curtains so I thought they would said curtains
Me: goes to an evil scientist *archives telepathy* ok I am ready
But why they didn't agree for the word to say ? Mr beast didn't say they  couldn't agree
"Taco" was the obvious answer.
I know the word  it was SUBCRIBE TO MRBEAST!!!!!!!!
Hahahaha
im surprised chris didn't say beans
Chris could have said shoelace I cat language lol 😆

The word they were supposed to say was "same"

I would have gone for zero
susuis

Something tells me Chris wanna go say beans
Karl is so angry
I thought for sure Chris was going to say Joe.
Lol
Did he say meow?
they maybe say karl's favorite word.
Chris said shoelace in cat
Mr Beast♡♡♡♡♡♡
lmao *im surprised they even said* a word
chris should have said Ratatouille
i thought they will say mr beast or jimmy                                                                      ....            . .  . . .
I think Chris said "MEOW" because Karl makes a cat noise sometimes😂
Same word
Assault against a $1,000
Flowey the Flower liked the experience What Jimmy is making on.

Plot twist: thwy both said shoelace but chris was speaking cat
Could have held up fingers or pointed at something lol
I thought they were gonna say pizza😳😳😳😳😳
I thought what they had to say is literally "exactly the same word" ...
I would say okay
Chris is beluga fan
Logic would say to use the word “the” since it is the most commonly used word.
they can easily say Mr beast
Joseph Joestar would have won
Hi
Unless MrBeast speaks cat he has no clue what word Chris actually said...
I was sooooo close I said shoe
3333+1th comment is mine 😂

They can tell mr beast 🤯

Chris never cease to amaze!!!!!! 🤣
Channel GumglaCZ
Sir I need 8000 dollars 💵 Please help me 🙏🙏
i would say "Hello World"
Can you give me 10grand/20 need to buy a laptop
Everyone’s talking about the words but no one’s talking about Karl’s outfit! It’s so cute 🥺
Mrbest i love your vidios 😁
Karl is known for meowing so I see were Chris is coming from
I thought they’d see the blinds behind them and say that
THE EXACT SAME WORD
The odds of this info being useful are slim, but just in case: if mr beast ever does the same thing to you and I'm the other person, I'll say pancake, dont forget
woulda said zero
One of them should’ve pointed to an item (e.g hat)
should’ve said zero it makes sense because he’s counting down
chandler would just say c h e e s e b a l l s
meow?
Why didn't they just say 0?
They could of both said yes 😂
@Beluga pls confirm chris word
Meow
I thought they would say chandler.
Shoelace, that might be the least used word in the world
They shoulda looked at something and agreed
I would have said 0
they actually did say the same word, chris just said it in cat and karl said it in english
Ilovi you❤
hahahahaha
Ñ
Plot twist: mrbeast got the 10k cause the vid got 10mil views
Mr beast said say the “same word”
easy point 2 fingers and say two
cats say that!
Ñ
Why is it, it’s his friends n a fan that he do it too
They probably would have rehearsed
Did anyone think of banana? Or is it just me 😂
Shoelace literally 😭😂
9.9 million views
I thought they were both gonna say “ok”
It’s concerning to me that the first word that came to my mind was “bananarama”
They should have both said "zero".
Why didn’t they just say zero? 😂
I would point to my shirt and the other person would know what to say and we both would say shirt
He should’ve said supermicroscopiccilicovolcanoconiosis
69
Hi mr beast
I’d just say the
mine was "peanut butter"
ngl, my mind would have gone blank and forgot every word i ever knew xD
Mr beast : you two must say the same word any word  Both: no!
Catboy Chris
Are u guys dumb? Chris clearly said Shoelace in Cat language
I would’ve said subscribe to mr beast
Should've signalled the hat
Brother please come in India
Bruh is my favourite word
they could’ve said what word to say when he was counting
Toast was in my head
Cats say that! Lmao
Just say "hi"
I would’ve said either “the same word” or “banana” 😂
“The same word”
You know they could have just decided on what word to say and then said it together with a sign of a nod or something - there wasn't a rule against that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
someBODY
Banana
Why did I say cheese-
9.5M views…
omg
Banana
would’ve just said zero
"shoelace"
I would have chosen zero as my word
hi
I’m sorry
Why would you say a random word they should say a basic word
Plot twist: Chris said shoelace in cat language 😶
Bwahahaha
Mrbeast: say the same word for $10,000 Me: say the wrong word for $0
Hi
This was funny
Me and my best friend would’ve said the n-word
$10,000 If They Say The Same Word
God loves you guys!
They should have talked about the word they should have said, and said it
what are the odds that they would have both said "shoelaces?"
Bruh
dummies should have said money
my favorite word is favorite
The could just say the countdown.
Hiiii
Why shoelace?
I was hoping they would both say couch since they both kinda looked at it
I would say "yes".
they shoud've said 10.000 instead of just random words.
Ni-
should’ve motioned to the shirt and said shirt
Should’ve said subscribe smh
Lol
Me “The exact same word”
If i karl i say MEOW well i haven't watched this SOOO BYE
I was genuinely surprised when they didn't both immediately say "subscribe"
They really should’ve said box
Ok so just in case, ill tell a friend to remember a word we say if we ever meet mrbeast.
My favourite is MrBeast
Should’ve gone with “the” its the most commonly used word in the English language and if you exaggerate your facial features it’s easier for the other to know what your gonna say.
That will be 6 secs.
So finally third Diamond button diamond 💎on its way .. Congo Mr. Beast  Shorts for 10 M
Is it even possible ?
Why don't you people say "one"
9.99M
They could have said “the exact same word”
almost at 10 mil
If it were me I wouldve said go
Yeah Karl go chuck that hat!
MR. Beast is what they should of said or subscribe
could have say zero
MrBeast in 2050: *If you exist, I'll give you $10.000*
We can easily say see him and then we can say Jimmy or mr beast
ZERO
They both should of said same words
I SWEAR TO GOD I SAID MEOW
Congratulations for 10 million in advance

I would have said amogus
I’d stick out my tongue and look at my tongue then say the word tongue
Me and my three friends all said bananana with the extra na
they should have said 0
How are they supposed to guess the same word that is literally almost impossible
Chris should have spoken a word first and then Karl can say the same. He didn't had rules for this.🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️

I would have said “zero” and pray my friend has the same idea as me
they could've just said "word"
I was expecting "Mr beast." Instead of meow and shoelace.
"So, how did you guys get married?" "Well, I proposed to her in a giant circle with 30 other people in a MrBeast challenge"☺☺
if i was in that game, i would point a object to give them a idea
To te sigo en español
Lik mijn billen

The thing is that Chris knows Karl meows a lot and assumes that the first word Karl thinks of but when the two are in a situation where they have to think of the same thing Chris thinks Karl will meow so he meows

Vedio idea for main channel: Jimmy i guess u guys should create hiking/ adventure/ travelling vedios with your team... That would be really cool... In your main channel, always money giving to strangers doesn't look that good always...I think u guys can create awesome adventerous vedios...
they could have non-verbally pointed to an object and agree to say that together lol

Betttgtttttt
I would have said "cheese burger"
Hi
*MINECRAFT!!!*
Chris the cat Karl the shoelace
you guys could’ve just said “the exact same word” lmao
I tought they were going to say 'Subscribe' ...
They shoulda said "same word"
Yo
Surprised they didn’t say Pog…
Yesz
Chris steal moneh
E
Too ez
early
I would punch the other person while saying ow
Me: “The exact same word.”
I really thought they would say it based off of there friendship that’s broken rn
2021
E
a
I would have said 10 grand
I think karl was supposed to say meow and chris say shoelace
I wish they said WOckY SlUsH
Mau
I would say Jimmy, its probably one of the biggest chance to say same word.
Omg they was Karl threw he’s hat lmao
I am a chicken
Too easy
MR BEAST IS BEST
*THEY SHOULD HAVE SAID ONE!*
Just point to a pillow or something
We all know jimmy would've said subscribe
I would've said banana. Anyone else?
Meow and shoelace?
I would have just said "ok"
hit chris and at the same time say "OUCHHH"
The outcome is that Chris wanted to be a Cat and Karl wanted the Money Seriously.
I would have definitely said subscribe xD
Just do a hand motion to try and communicate what you should say.
Plot Twist: They actually had to say "The exact same word."
who else said banana? just curious if someone actually thought the same as me
they could've just said "CERO" after Mr. Beast was done counting
Joe mama
Ok
He never said they can't tell each other in the 5 seconds.
Lol
Why can’t they just say ok at the same time
Talk about impressions of Gary from spongebob
*Meow*
hi
Wha
Banger
XD
Shoelace- Ah yes
I would say Give money
hi
“Word” would’ve worked
Why didn't they just smile at each other. Then they'd both know to say cheese! 🧀
I would’ve said zero
Oo
The same word when do I get payed
Hello
Mr beast 6000 ohhhhhhh
Give karl my #
I feel so bad for Karl
Karl is a god
"Cats say that!" yes chris, cats do indeed say "meow", but I don't think karl is a cat.
why are "all" shorts reuploading, whats happening
When mr beast needs some extra cash he posts this 😂
Give me the $10,000🤣😂😂😂
Zero! they shall say "zero" This is infuriatingggg
yo
omg great
Your the best
It would've been easier with Chandler cause we know he's gonna say McDonald's
Hi

Mr beast : if you say the exact same word in 5 seconds you get 10 000 $ Me : the exact same word
I thought they would both say “subscribe to mrbeast shorts”
If i was there i would say name
I was expecting the word to be "subscribe".
Bruh the obvious answer would've been "subscribe"
I see karl went to tumblr 😂
Can I chime into this or any next challenge? Could really use 10k right now. Thanks🤣
they should have said 69

Wow

MrBeast in 2069: Destroying Eiffel Tower and surprise France with a taller one....
They could easily have say "Mr Beast"
Karl: I'm just gonna say shoelace and win 10k$  Chris:uhh i really want to be a cat
Imagine if both of said zero

Mrbeast: Chris clearly didn’t want you guys to win Karl: grabs Chris,s hat and yeets it  Chris : cats say that!

Haha
mr beast is running out of ideas
i would've said "the" because that's a pretty common word
first
Chris really craving for cats, then theres Karl..
Both should have said "Chandler"
I hope that whoever found this comment stays safe
Wow Chris is a cat
Is it just me or does Karl look different?
Chris is a cat and karl said shoelace... boo
poor karl with his shoelace...
Best YouTuber subscribe to Mr Beast
Eg
Det var

Only OGs will understand “Hey Chris do you moisturize?
Lol Jimmy still doing these challenges
Karl should have hissed, or said woof
WIFE COMES HOME THESE TWO CUDDLED UP TOGETHER :p
Hhdh
Chris how dare you
Early
They failed, meow and shoelace don’t actually mean the same thing 😢
Maybe if Karl spoke cat they could have won
Karl: shoelace Chris:cat
He never said they couldn’t talk about it for 5 seconds while he counted…… lol

Never ask: -a man his salary  -a woman her age  -Chris what was going through his head while making cat noices
Early
Can I get pinned :(
chris: became a literal cat
hi mrbeast
You wont pin this comment (do it)
i Love it when notification show up " Legend liked " your comment  And You Have ‘‘ New Subscriber ’’
amaze
"Subscribe" would've been the surefire word to win $10,000 here
Never ask: -A woman her age -A man his salary -Chris why the fawk he has transcended into a cat
Meow
It's clearly Karl's fault in that scenario. Meowing's the only logical thing to do.
"what" is my favorite word
lol
I honestly thought they would say subscribe
im the 132 comment
Should have said beans
Karl - Shoelace Chris - *Meow*  So, clearly, the 10k is gone.
shoelace intensifies
Evil Chris
