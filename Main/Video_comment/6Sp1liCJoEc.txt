2025
Hmm I wonder what happened at that Liverpool game....
CONTE = Tried tested and proved manager as spurs look like the real deal.
Don’t forget to add that we’ve had the easiest fixtures so far amongst the top 6 clubs
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Listen to goldbridge talk, his low key "Ole out " 😅 ... i love it
Mark Goldbrige this is the best analysis you have ever done since you opened this channel. Absolute Truth!!
Everything he says is pointing to Ole Out. But he won’t say it. Wonder why?
How can you blame the glaziers because of the loss to Leicester??? Look at the team United had 🤣🤣
Penaldo is not top even top 5 best players of all time.
United couldn't handle the press, both Matic and Pogba were ripped to shreds, then the back four. Dreadful. Hard to pin this on Ole.
Greenwood. Needs to be less selfish. He needs to be passing . Start sancho on the right next game
United in the mud
I sincerely hope Arsenal finish above ManU this season. That'd highlight your club's plight like nothing else 😂
Matic and Pogba are the best two midfielders for United? Do you really have to say any more?
What I don’t get is you rate Matic but if Fred made those mistakes he gets slaughtered
"David de Gea is MOTM, and he's conceded four goals" 😯 👀
Broke & Desperate. Pls send Donations to Mark Edwards, Flat 7, Preston Court, Sandford Lane, Wareham, Dorset, BH20 4DX, UK. Pls Share address everywhere 🙏🏻
I love man Utd they are such a joke of a club haha
Only have to look everytime UTD play a team with a decent coach they get outplayed, Dean Smith, Rafa, Emery, Rodgers..
OLE IN,OLE IN, OLE IN, OLE IN!!!!
Ole should change the style of play..
This is literally last season on repeat but I see the same sort of thing happening ole figures  it out pulls his finger out you start playing well and get a decent run going and come the business end youll start stuttering like a car on empty maybe finish 3rd 4th and it's seen as a good season "progress" if you win something
Ask ole who he think is responsible for losing that match……wonder what will he say.
I love how Goldbridge keeps bantering Arsenal 🤣🤣🤣 week after week yet we have a crap manager  in OLE
I think Ole selects his team and sends it to WoodWard for approval.😂
ole out bored now
" But he's got the Man Utd DNA " ..... what bollocks
The only kick up the arse this Manchester United need is from a new manager, simple stuff, but hey, United will wait till Newcastle is a the door of top 4 to get going with some proper goals.
Even with the players we bought in the summer I had hope but my thoughts were we would not win anything because of the lack of quality coaching. This fool will never win us anything simple as. Bring Zidane in!
Like Arteta. Ole needs some time 😜
100% agree with you Mark ... wasn't expecting I would, but I do. Sad to see all the way from ownership down to all the coaches are not interested or competent to run our club ... Thanks for caring and for your content. ... Long live Manchester United!
Beg Jose to come back
Do u think the players dont want to play for ole
Ole is a great manager, he is at the wheel. No penalty basically UTD is fucked and he blamed Klopp. LMAO
Lindelof played well though
It’s like Friends Reunited
We don't need a rookie manager who is as clueless as a headless chicken. He has no authoritive presence and he mocks the quality of the players he actually has at his disposal. Ronaldo had EVERY RIGHT NOT TO CELEBRATE the nonsense clapping because it was BEYOND TERRIBLE and BEYOND SHAMEFUL...if Ole and the entire coaching staff and the damn Glazers had any genuine love for the club, they should vacate their positions in all sectors and bring in people like Pep or Zidane who KNOW what they are doing and an experienced coaching staff with an absolute winning mentality is needed. We don't need a managerial staff based on sentimental crap.. We need staff who have experience and the know how to ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND HAVE THE HUNGER TO WIN.. Miracles only happen when effort is genuine, Ole.. You can't burden Ronaldo as the sole savior to help the club.. He can't work his magic if the team that are meant to be his support are pathetically not even putting in the effort..i won't blame him if he decides to leave for Man City where he will be utilized WISELY and with ACTUAL support from the team who work their own asses off to win in every game. I would be happy for him if he goes to other clubs because he doesn't deserve to be in a club that has become such a dipshit...i feel for him and he has every right to be furious and embarrassed... and many United fans need to stop being delusional arrogant morons...we don't have anything to boast about and we lost the actual right to gloat the moment we took things for granted. Sad but true... I have never seen the club I have supported for the past 4 decades become so hopelessly pathetic under the blind guidance of an immature coaching staff along with a delusional manager and ignorant owners. Oh how the greats have fallen. And we deserve the reverse humiliation from the Liverpool supporters as we have been doing that to them for so long and now it's their turn to mock us and I don't blame them.
Stop fooling yourself talking about go ahead and beat Liverpool 😂😅
Ole in!
Make or break time with these upcoming fixtures.
Ole is selfish and thinks of boosting his own resume for other jobs at Man U expenses and being bribed by Glazers to take the wave for their own personal greed
You won’t see a title for 30 years.
7:44 Mark says Ole should resign. At last!
wow trending
Glazier protest before LFC game again surely
People need to realise Maguire ain’t good enough to, we make excuse for him because he is English he was a fault for all four goals yesterday Maguire is average at best tbh besides his heading abilities and he is worlds most expensive defender it’s shocking
I hope pogba goes good PSG or citeh wow they would improve as a team
Ole needs to go cause the Glazer's aren't going anywhere soon
Lol I love this guy
Worse performance we’ve had in a long time seems to be the statement after every game now
When your best player is the keeper week after week you're in big trouble...😱😳
thank you for your comment on ronaldo! he needs to be used as substitute specially against above  middle table teams.
GLAZERS WERE ALWAYS THE PROBLEM NOW U BUMS TURN TO THEM WHEN U LOSE BUT WHEN U WIN U FORGET 🤡
Pogba's comment shows that the players are not happy with the manager!
Mourinho lost his job after losing to Liverpool
I am starting to feel that we are turning into Arsenal. Once champions, than consistent top4, than fighting for top4 and now mid-table.. Please correct me if I am wrong!
If we don't get rid of ollie now then Newcastle will beat us to another manager the prem league is now going to get even harder with Newcastle its like trying win the 100 metre freestyle with lead weights around our ankles and oliie is the weights
When Utd don't finish in the top 4 and fail to get out of the group stages of the Champions League the Glazers might not be so supportive of Ole.
Nervous Breakdown FC... Glazers Out!
Mark: "this board only cares if we are in the Champions League".  Mark, we will not be in the EUROPA league at the rate we are losing.
You've massively over achieved in recent times, all the penalties and Fernandez worldies just plastered over the cracks and bailed Ole out of poor performances and poor tactics/game plans. Once those dry up you see what's really going on
seb 😢😢😢😢
A joke of a club, living off of the Fergie years,
Chelsea would DEFINITELY sack him
How glazers are the issue I just wants to know ? You have Pogba Sancho Ronaldo Varane all targets you want they gave you still if your are not performing well and blaming owners then seriously mate you are wrong
Only if we had Chris Wood and James Tarkowski
Why blame the glazers? They spent miliions to bring in top class players to a mid class team to get 5 th place finish. Next year that might be impossible with NEW CASTLE challenging them.
Work experience manager
Ole deserves lifetime contract 😂
Ole out!
Why won’t this guy just say ole out! It’s clearly what he wants. Weirdo
Love Ole. Always will. But not good enough to manage this team yet. With more experience maybe come back on down the line but it’s now time for a change.
Why is Mark defending Ole, he asks why should fans decide whether Ole stays or goes, because they pay his wages, Solskjaer has no technical or tactical nous, he doesn't know how to use substitutes, let's not talk about Ronaldo, the honeymoon is over, he is past it, he is not a 90 minute player, he is now an impact player, an off the bench player, Cavani is far better player and works for the team. Maguire should have moved to that ball, that was basic, a disgrace, a shambles.
Mark was not Glazers out when Lvg n Jose were losing games  Glazers were same that time too
Ole is such a fraud, he knows he isn’t good enough but he’s hanging on to this job because he know his managing career is over when he leaves united.
Blaming the Glazers when you have this squad. I like Mark but let's be serious for a second mate.
Ronaldo should have went to city.
Maguire just shot Leicester back on form
Ole had enough period in the international break to restructure everything
Take your point but Chelsea would never sack him because they would never have appointed him in the first place. They don't want inexperienced coaches leaning on the job, big clubs don't do that (except Man U and Arsenal). Lampard was a one-off in exceptional circumstances.
I'm not saying they need to sack ole Next min- they need to start talking to other managers  Next min- he needs to resign...   Make up your mind son
Mark I don’t understand how you can say all things, yet still be adamant you’re not ole out? It’s blatantly obvious we need to get him out, stop being so stubborn. These results are nothing to do with the glazers
Time up for Ole.
Salah to pack OLE bags and Kane to drop him off to the airport
Mark ur ranting but like to sit on the fence.  You're Ole out but don't wanna admit it!
This guy Goldberg is so two faced! Few weeks back he was cursing fans who are calling Ole out. More like Rustberg then Goldberg!
Blabkabla
Mark. God bless you bud. You should definitely have your own YouTube channel!
Next week this bloke says Ole Out 100%
Goldbridge getting emo about ole out LOL
OLE OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!
.
You want the glazers out but they bought you Varane, Ronaldo, Sancho. Stop crying, you have a shite manager
Ole in Gary N out
Glazers Out are your line but they are not managing the team(I don't like glazers by the way and are a big issue but do we stop going to matches stop buying new shirts every year no, so do you really support Man Utd) Solskaer is and it's his team. Players have to have self-respect from there themselves I always gave 110% for my team and teammates they are walking across around the field leaving the likes of Fred run around like headless chickens trying to sweep up and cannot be that bad plays for Brazil in his right position.
ole in
Manchester united is like Sri Lankan government family & friends who runs
OGS is another SAF appointment since he retired and he needs to stop butting in. CR7 singing was a smoke screen
pogba was saying that the players need help because they dont know what to do
Foreign rich owners will/are take english football back 50 years - remember 1966 . Now it is becoming circusfarewell to sport.
I’m ole out We need a good coach We need somebody to improve players such as sancho Rashford martial  We need zidane
We will be better one Pogba leaves, how many times did he lose the ball today.
The truth is that ole cannot manager Manchester,
Olé out
Well I cant believe it's took you this long to realise he ain't going to work .we need a strong good manager that gets backed that's it BEAUSE THE OWNERS ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNLESS WE PROTEST RELENTLESLEY
🤣🤣🤣
As an observer I think 🤔 u replace Ole with a Klopp even with this board u are flying ! Maybe 🤔 I don’t understand it all in great detail - from what I’m seeing it’s very very hard to come across a ole in supporter.
neco williams has more assists than bumcho lmao
Disgusting no philosophy from top to bottom and to top it off the manager who's sailing the ship hasn't a clue. He needs no start changing or being ruthless as there's nothing to lose now. Some big games coming up that will be the end of it.
You said it your self ole is not gonna win us anything so how is it still the glazers fault. Ye we all won’t them out. But ole has to go no matter who the owners are. He has to go now before we lose out on another season.
Your soo right 💯💯
Keep Ole please 🙏.Top manager in premier league.  😂 🤣 😆
This was One of maguire worts preformnets
greenwood’s all round play has improved massively. you’re lying there mark and you were spot on about most things today
"I won't say Ole out....but this is sackable....he should resign"  🤣
When one watches the football other teams are playing - Man City, Liverpool, Chelsea and even Brentford and then watch the bland, colourless, abject football played by Man United its painful! Much as the club owners are to take blame, as a manager you must produce on the field. This guy OGS is just a cliwn & failure masquerading as a football coach- pathetic! The coaching has ruined this club. One needs to just look at Jadon Sancho if ever there was evidence of poor coaching needed - at Man United he is not even a quarter of the player he was at  Dortmund! So sad.
Unbelievable blame the glazers they spend over 100million every year but blame the glazers.
Friends for real club smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
We want Ole stay. And won trophies. Even if it would take another 5 years
Ole please please stay🙏. I find happiness week in week out seeing mu play. Pls stay... please please please stay. 😂
Ole out. Let's go Brandon!
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO - ‘The Glazers’🥴
At this point I’d drop Bruno or Pogba for DVB 100%…. AWB should stick to defending
Get Ole away from our club.. Forever.. I don't want to ever see him there again.. Erase his playing history from Uniteds records.. Change his Wikipedia too... NOW
Thumbnail is wrong..
This club is finished from top to bottom we united fans need to start protesting but this time even harder because we don’t deserve this
Ole is going to bring glories to Man UTD... He only need another billion dollar investment... Pls give it to him
Arsenal will be above manu by december
When lazy players like pogba start calling you out live on tv your days are numbered. He’s done well to bring the feeling back but that’s it and each game that passes  we’re in danger of slipping into the back end of Jose and van gaal era.
Almost every player did well for their national teams but not in United. It is all Ole's faults.
This guys a joke. Still refuses to be OLE OUT because its IrReLeVaNt! But was happy to be MOURINHO OUT, VAN GAAL OUT.   Whata  joke
If glazers really support and love United, they would have sack ole and paid his compensation but unwilling because THEY NEED MORE PROFIT.
Can people protest against the ownership and management again. There is power in unity, let’s get united against the Glazers 💪🏿. The season is still salvageable but not for long. It may just be up to the fans in the stadium. Have your voice heard please.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ole is as good as a league one manager. Glazers + ole out. Such a clueless manager
Eddie howe is available he is young and is a great coach reminds me of Nagelssman, Sack ole today and go for howe he would be able to get this team playing incredibly well, Fred was a huge miss today, Sancho isnt good enough
Ole out
It’s not only glazers out, OLE + GLAZERS OUT. glazers don’t want to sack him because they don’t want to pay compensation
Imagine Ole managing City or Liverpool etc …. Oh yeah it wouldn’t happen! Because he’s not f**king good enough!
The Glazers were responsible for that result? You are insane mate. Get help.
Well said! Every word so true 👏🏻👏🏻
Lazy play, lazy players, feels like the players aren't playing for him
I’m tired and sick of watching Ronaldo head hanging leaving the pitch.He came in a hero and now he wondering why?
He has to go…enough now
Mark please stop messing about he has to go
OLE OUT
Ole is so predictable. After this loss, he will play mcfred in every match from now onwards. Thats the only thing he knows to do. Sack him before MU slide into  7th or 8th. To me this season is done. Get a better manager in before ole ruins the club.
Mark really deflected on the glazers coz he doesn’t wanna say Ole needs to go , wow 💀
come on now, ole out conte in
When Rogers went to Leicester within a month you saw a style and pattern of play. Ole 3yrs on and I’m still waiting for a style. Each game we NEVER have a midfield we are wasting talent
Ole's problem is he can't manage a team and the coaches we know are crap and when we got Ronaldo don't forget he left the premier league over a decade ago and that league he left is not the same as it is now its a lot tougher relying on a solo striker to win you the league isn't happening because you need a pressing team and i mean the front 6 players full of energy we are lacking that and we will be worse off because Ronaldo will not be able to handle the intensity, which we are seeing.
Poor seb..even he knows ole is shite
Honestly i dont know if it was Ole's fault or was it Maguire's fault .
When Fred’s back things will be grand
I remember few years ago When Man United fans they where furious on David De Gea, you’re the only man who backed the man and now I see why.
What is reason calling Man Utd one of biggest Club if we can't fix managerial problem.
Siiuuuuuu ole's at the wheel 🤣
Boy you talk alot of bs
I don't see any changes from last season..Ole has started reminding me of lampard who got so many players signed for him yet the performance didn't change and tuchel did wonders with the same team. Time to get rid of ole.
Spurs were once called mates fc under mason......now it'sman united that's mates fc straight from the board
It's so sad that, I was Brentford play Chelsea without fear with attack after attack. They are playing more the United way than, Manchester United
Honestly, I start to feel that my health ( My heart, my chest, my head) not suitable for watching Manchester United matches under the leadership of Ole Solskjaer!! Oh my God, now I am forced not to attend matches and not watch them live on TV. What have you done to us, Ole Solskjaer, you and the bad management of Manchester United
The graveyard for great players continues. Static and Pogba also offer little.
Of course it was McTominay that, just after he was brought on, was the one who let the cross come in for 3-2.
To be fair, Murtough is good enough! He brought the players Ole needed, In fact, the previous managers would only have dreamed of the players Ole has. If Mourinho got Varane, Maguire, Sancho, Ronaldo, Cavani, Bruno, he would have won the league
mark we are lucky if we finish 4th these is where ole could take us at most that's  it!!!!
Just say it ole out have u been paid by ole. They got all d players u asked for.
Ole out please
"If liverpool beat us next week" the irony. Maguire will get turned inside out might well stay at home. Drop maguire please.
Manutd fans should put pressure on club.ole out ole out. What is his tactic
I agree Ole may not be the man. But his team selection wasn't terrible (bar taking sancho off and playing him on the left) the players were choppy all over today
OGS = Only Given Smiles
Pogba was awful today. Our important players are not performing
I’m crying that he thinks the protests led to buying players
He’s finally Ole out
Could Moyes, Van Gaal, or Jose do much better than Ole with the current squad?
Over 300 mil. spent. Another disaster, another manager needed. Off-loading shares. Utd in free fall.
Why don't  you go to overlap channel and talk to nevile  caragher  and Scholes  face to face and talk about this current  situation  about man united
I said this and I'll say it again, Ronaldo Will repent!  Football isn't ti be handled, managed by emotions, feelings, but actually with Trophies.  The only teams that could do that are Man city and Bayern München  Most likely Man City and he chose he's heart. Now he's paying.. and will continue to do
yeah....just buy most expensive manager too.... you really think you can buy success hahahah...you allready have Maguire haah
We know when managers loses their confidence with their players, well the United players have lost the confidence with their manager and coaching staff.  Sorry Ole you need to go.
Grow some balls mark and just say Ole out
If you wanna play cr7 up front then don't play Greenwood! Since his first instinct is to score than assist and I would rather play Sancho of RW and Martial on LW and if you wanna play Mason then Drop Ronaldo
Livpool game is ole last game trust me
There are serval matches proved Ronald isn’t the right guy to be our solo striker, we should put cavani or greenwood at that position instead, put Ronald at the left side and give him a free role, that’s the formula of his success in the last decade
Ole is the best Liverpool manager since David Moyes.
I've seen elephant's turn quicker than Maguire
Still blows my mind that people think he’s the right man for the job. He is tactically clueless
We miss Fred
MR MOLDE get back to the level you belong to!
The point is the owners are not deciding on things to protect the club that is why we need to voice out.
Ole out. Is what you must say, because we can’t don’t anything with that
After this match , we definitely need a change , Eric Bailey on the bench with a back line that were lacking speed except for was , bisaka , a midfield that needed a pit bull and a tenacious midfielder and whole and behold Donny van Derek on the bench . Our captain macquire giving away two goals and manager Ole just looking as if he does not have a clue to the game . This is totally unacceptable and disappointing , we have the class and the talent but yet still we played class less and talent less . Something has to change .
You are absolutely  right. Long time supporter . MU are a crap team.
However pathetic Glazers are they invested superb on Ole and any manager could do this job…
Who tf would play ronaldo at 9 he was never great at number 9 position only when mourinho tried it. Ole thinks he is mourinho. Let Cavani play at number 9 an CR7 as a winger. This ole has to get out I can't wait
The problem with man u is that all the Superstar are playing for induval glory other than playing as a team for the club to win games?
How the hell can these so call supporters  sing his name unbelievable rubbish
Be funny of man u beat liverpool and man city then everyone will love ole again
Apt commentary. No tactics no direction. United are in shambles
Can blame ole all you want but if players don't turn up thats not ole fault 💁‍♂️
Ole is such a unfair guy he should just leave the club since he claims he loves united
ronaldo is the reasons for this failures ... they will be better team without him
united is the most clueless side in the world right now the worst team to watch it hurts
Man City can play Bernardo Silva and De Bruyne as two 8s, regardless of who plays as the 6 (Rodri, Gundo, Ferna). But we can't seem to find the right balance with Pogba and Bruno in the same team. It's down to coaching, 100%
Mike Ashley is looking to buy a new club. Maybe the Glazers will sell to him?. 😉
Other than all the mismanagement, no one is questioning Oles signing record. Dan James, Wan Bissaka, DVB, Sancho and the best of all, Maguire.
988888888888988888888888888898888888888888
Maguire was truly awful today. I know he probably isn’t 100% but still. He’s been terrible all season. The truth is, Lindelof deserves to start along with Varane when he comes back. But the politics will say otherwise
Over seven years on from that famous 5-3 humbling by the same team in Blue. Man United produce another record - how to lose heavy to teams that they used to destroy without breaking sweat.
The only good thing about all this is this will be ole's last managerial job LOL
The board need to be on the phone with zizo after that performance
Liverpool will absolutely spank us. They are a proper TEAM. We are just a bunch of headless chickens running about. When that happens I think ole will go.
The moment united got Ronaldo...Greenwood became a useless greedy prat!! He wants to shoot from impossible angles instead of passing the ball. I will bench him and get Sancho into his right position! (Even though i believe Sancho should have not been bought, we needed a DMF instead)
Manu would probably fluke a win/draw against liverpool then keep ole for another 2years
Blaming the owners after bringing in Sancho, Ronaldo and Varane hahahhahahah
u guys in england should go in old trafford and protest the glazers out
Mark is just living a deluded life with this "ole may not be good" stance. Ole is a crap manager, POINT BLANK!! he was never good from his interim days.
No mcfred to blame today, ole maybe?
Totally agree. The players don’t know what to do. They play like a amateur team, don’t know when to play quick when to play slow, don’t know to control the game. Totally no clue. Cheers
Leicester were better drilled than man utd. The way we lost the ball in both halves....we looked lazy and lost.....disgusting...I don't know what they're doing on the training ground
It's not about OLE. This is about the Glazers. Ole is a Club Legend. Of course he believes he can do the job. The Glazers need to make a decision. Not Ole.
Ole out.....any decent manager with even a bit of tactics would coach this team to trophies
Ole is so stubborn what van dee beek will do more worse that this match performance????can you just give him chances??
If we get a proper manager who actually does his job nobody will care about the glazers back when united were winning we had the glazers ole is just a poor excuse of a manager
I really do think that Ole is just a bit of an overall idiot. Great player but not much going on upstairs.
Absolutely embarrassing, no other way to put it
Stop it goldbridge..olly need to go ok.stop saying to fans..you not olly out yet..it time to rid of olly asap..
Trust the process ole will deliver
Marks only got off the fence when it’s taken down
A life without Jesus-Christ is a wasted life , people!  Believe in Christ now while there's still time, and get your sins washed away by His redeeming Blood.  You are being lied to by this satanic self-deceived world, the devil is lying to us Only Jesus Christ The savior is going to get us out of this whole mess. No one else can, not even ourselves The Bible says in Mark 8:36 ''For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? ''
"Leicester 4-2 Manchester United! Mark Goldbridge reacts to a massive win for United" Description sus
Ole got some of the best players yet,  he still managed to put together the worst team again n again......
I have defended ole from the start, but his time is done, took this team as far as he can, need a manager in to take us to levels we should be at. Never wanted to say Ole out but that’s where i am
The problem with you and ole is that u complex certain players like pogba, greenwood, matic, linderlof etc, and condemn important players like Fred, Baily, mata, lingard and Martial
Ole has to go simple as that
We lost fine......... atleast its not as bad as your marriage or your hair line your an ex officer for and arrest ole
The type of football were playing. Not good enough to win against liverpool or fighting for a title
Lampard is a legend at Chelsea and yet he was fired by his boss. So stop saying that Ole is a legend. He's not good at coaching United. he does not have the level.
Ole and Carrick seem to have fallen out.
Never felt more like singing the bluesssss
Slow, lack of a plan, poor out of possession, not enough closing down opposition players, not winning enough 50/50 balls, not aggressive enough, defending is a mess, attacking is not designed to make the best of Ronaldo. United do have many good players, players other top teams in Europe would consider buying, being badly managed. United have a manager no other top team in Europe would ever employ.    United need a manager who has already won silverware at the top level.  Fire Ole Now! Bring in a credible top manager for Wednesday.  Ole is done! Zidanne and Conte are available.
Manutd doesn't have any ambition to win any title. Most of the actions at this club are reactive actions rather than proactive actions. If there is any ambition, we would get Conte now.
Fair play to the glazers, they have actually invested in the squad the last two years.. after all said and done I think they have finally lifted their game.. now we need a manager and coaching staff that can do the same..   I agree with the sentiment of glazers out.. but I reckon they have finally heard the cries and have pulled their finger out.. who can truly deny we haven’t invested properly.. look at our team.. if we can’t find midfielders it’s frickin Ollies fault for not going after one..   Cmon everyone, look at the proper direction now..
when did woodward say he was gonna leave? Did he give a date?
Ole in Ole in. Ole at the wheels
Man united fans finally realising what I've been saying since the day ole came in united will never win a trophy with ole in charge because he's a dogshite manager
He should resign.
Give Ole one more year
dont worry guys...Its Klopps fault!!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
United is not doing that bad.  It's just that their rivals are doing so well.
I just don't think a change of manager will make too much difference with these owners! However! If this continues then for the first time since his appointment i feel that his time will and should be at an end and replaced by believe it or not Pep! There I've said it......👹
Team play with no passion to win. The midfield & back are terrible. Ole doesn't have enough capability to manage MU. OLE OUT !!!
This 4231 formation doesn't suit United. Maybe it's time for a change (433)
Ole.... In
Parsimonious spending tactics by the family Glazer - Full Stop !
United is a team that routinely demonstrates individual brilliance and collective incompetence.
Ole actually said  They missed Fred, Mark called it
It has been the coaching, admit it that your analysis are flawed. Check the records, most games Fred doesn’t play in, we lose, check it. He isn’t the greatest cdm Cos that’s not his players. They ran through the midfield today, even the commentator said, they have never seen a ball played through the midfield so easily. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
No MU player played actually. They were just watched and waited for leichester bad passing. No one tried to catch or win the ball. No one. And they had Maguire who played like no one good enough to bit him.
Haaland and mbappe =Generational talent greenwood no never far too individualistic will have fantastic moments but never plays well when he doesn’t score
Ole out ffs!!!!
he is ole out
we have arteta
United got good players.  United  midfield was weak.
these things are not easy, i agree
we are rebuilding
Should hire Bob Martínez or ten Hag.
Glaziers won't make that decision.....Ollie made early subs... didn't work...so,who's fault is it? Club is a mess.
i get it
i dont want to say i watched that final
who takes over from Ole?
long ball iis easy, just clear it
4 goals by a back 5?
so in or out?
i believe you, i didnt watch it
you hate the long ball? but if works it works?
stop dodging behind Fred.
Ole in or out?
yo middle table fc win a match.
Ole can be a nice guy but he’s learning on the job and his managerial mind isn’t up to scratch. We should have gone for Laurent blanc, a manager who has a set way his teams play, has won trophies and is know for having great man management.
This is United's game plan. Lads get the ball to the wingers and you guys go and dribble at them and score and setup Ronnie.
I've said so many times it's not just mcfred and I think today proves it. What did we create today except for a long ball and moments from Greenwood? We look clueless!
If United were Liverpool, City or Chelsea, Ole wouldn't have got the job in the first place,
Sorry Ole, midfield getting caught going sideways and backwards, defenders should be owning and bullying their own box. Bruno totally lost in a nowhere position, no wonder the opposition just walk straight through the team. Every other manager sees it except for one !!!
No ones in a title race in october 16th mark!! Man city were 11th at this point last season on 12 points and win the league
Mark unreal!👌
Love ole as a player and person, hate ole the manager!!
Goldberg you are a joke. Maguire was by far the worst player but you slate Lindgard and Mctonamy. Bruno did absolutely nothing but you slate other players. You are part of the problem mate
Ole in for life!!
Idk why Mark is glazers out. They gave ole Sancho, Varane and fking Ronaldo I mean what more do you want from transfers. Ole has been backed enough imo.
Last game he make double change on take off the players who daminating the game on we draw on cud have lose the game this have no brain.
Good job again Ole 😂
This has been man u since fergie but  everyone is afriad to say it fergie had no style of play but because he was a bully he got away with it. The fear factor has gone from man u and the chickens have to come to roost.
Imagine Manchester United dragging Ronaldo to europa league, disgraceful smh
Why you having a dig at arsenal lol you lot are crap 💩 don’t take it out on the gunners
How can u blame about the glazers  U have ronaldo ffs
OLE IS AT THE WHEEL 😂
Tbf United were lucky to beat West Ham and the victory over Wolves was totally undeserved...let's be honest....it could be and should be even worse!!!
This guy is full of oxymorons
You are becoming more and more political. Today's debacle at Leicester City was down to the poor manager and staff; and not the Glazers. Same way, had they won the game today, you wouldn't be attributing the win to the Glazers. Stop playing *both* sides, Mark! You don't have to say "Ole out", but don't feed us bovine excrement either!
Our english based backline is SHIITE. 120M?? MAGUIRE SHAW N BISSAKA cant string a pass together. Wan bissaka with his stupid chewing gum. OLE FOOKIN OUT
Funny enough Ole said he missed Fred. FFS
It’s time to go!!
“Ole needs to resign” but still isn’t Ole out lol
We dropped so many points already and we still haven't played Liverpool, city and Chelsea...
Ole won’t play anything but 4-2-3-1 no matter if we’re winning or getting battered, he has no plan-b or any other ideas. Teams have figured him out so he can no longer out play them, they know what to expect of Ole.
There any Ole in fans left, because if so please explain
Please  God🙏 Ole Remains At The  Wheel.
Forget this club forever
Nah we need a change of system
To many fanboys
To many supporters defend the manager
Ole Out more than ever. Get him gone. Ole if you're reading this, if you love the club just step down, you aren't good enough for the job. Resign if you want some fans to have respect for you.
Ole out Thomas frank in
OLE OUT!!!
The thee Fs . Mark the legend i folow u frm ur begaining ur realy great  i m happy that i followed u this long
I would advice Donny to stick it out....at this rate he's gonna outlast that manager
What doesn’t make any sense is the Donny signing came out of nowhere and as much as we loved it Ole clearly didn’t, but Sancho has been our top target other then Haaland for over a year!
We have the fear factor back, we are scared of every team in the premier ,awful football no plan A or B OLE out please.
Ole isn't even a championship level mamanger
Jonny evans was able to stroll about made it look easy
Ronaldo's only bad choice in football was coming to united and not city.
Remember when Leicester trashed City 5-2 last season and then City went on a good run and eventually won the League. So, this is a good sign, Ole will surely win the Premiership now.
Crisis is not over until we sack ole
You man United fans are so entitled you’ve spent over a billion but are moaning
Ole "we need more legs" .Ok Fred's coming back lol .
The glazers delivered u Ronaldo, Sancho, varane and yet u want them out lol bunch of spoiled brats 😂🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
If ole goes who should we get conte for me premier league winner
Who does not know by now when it come to tactics on the fly Ole is clueless.
Mark do you think the players are playing for ole
Another weekend ruined by ole the wally
One of the goals was because Matich mistake 🤦‍♂️
Ole just needs some time.
We need to drive the Glazers out NOW, they wouldn’t support any NEW manager or coach set up.The coaching is so poor we would’ve still lost with Varane
We need to change the coaching staff or else we are going to the championship
Come on ole sack your staff
We really need Zidane, he made Ronaldo the most dangerous forward itw during his years coaching madrid.
We need a Roy Keane who put in flying tackles show same bloody passion
See what happens when Fred's left on the beach
I only watched the highlights but it looked as though Maguire had a nightmare.
I love how Maguire gets no criticism in this whole video tirade despite him being the worst player for us today. The teflon English players wear is superb quality.
I promise you were not losing any of the next 9 games
Don’t sack ole, the players are to blame , a waste of space the lot of them.
Ole to play a back 10 against Liverpool to try and steal a draw.
Please keep Golum..... Please!
Mark this just isn't on Ed Woodward or the glazers, this is ALL on Ole and his terrible coaching staff. He's gotten practically everything he's asked for. OLE OUTTTTTTTT
This is precisely why I didn't want Ronaldo to come back to the club because I was afraid his legacy was going to be tarnished under Ole's management.
We fire Ole and then what? We bring Conte. If that doesn't work then we will go back to hate de Glaziers.  People should focus their anger with the owners.
These players have politely down tools
why does maguire get away with these terrible performances
Wasn't surprised, not even angry just resigned....that's bad right?
I'm scared of how Liverpool are gonna destroy us at Old Trafford
Ex legends of the club don't work
Matic mctommi Fred Pogba out
Do not go to old traffords until olé leaves !
Simple mark,do not go to old traffords !
🤡🤡🤡🤡
Then change the fkn manager and made these players that “don’t suit the system”
How United fans pick on individual players 🤕. Absolutely delusional. We all know that we are being screwed by the management of this team but fans are still calling out players as the main issue. I am 100% in support of criticising all the players, but calling them overrated or not living up to the United shirt like this United still has a shirt to live up to is absolutely abhorrent. We can clearly see that this club doesn't want to improve the game either by not supporting the managers or not recruiting properly.
Last couple of years yeah it was all the cos of the Glazers, but this time it’s all about Ole and still lots of fans support him.
There were literally just 10 players on the pitch for Man U. He has no idea how to use Ronaldo. Just wasting his time on the pitch. Fans should stop going to the ground to agitate against these shambolic performances.
Oli plz stay 😂
Simply EMBARRASSING
Lewis dunk Jessie lingard start
Bruno gone off the boil. Harry Kane Shane Duffy and Pieria from Leicester.
Frank Thomas Frank Thomas
Its starting to get really really sad now. I don't know how much longer this will go on for but our problems are bigger than Ole and his bunch of crap coaches. Our club is rotten to the core and nothing will change anytime soon. May as well get used to this feeling now 💔   🔴⚪⚫
Did ole win a make a wish foundation
You guys don't press on the back four since Ronaldo has arrived, to easy to pass through the lines
ole out
What is Ronaldo supposed to do???? Coach or manage the team???? That's OBVIOUSLY not his job
Goldbrige is saving his Ole out when we get a spanking from liverpool next weekend.
No Fred this time to complain about.
If we lose Wednesday and Sunday... ole will be gone 100%
Maguire ha Duffy in straight away
MEULENSTEEN BACK!!
A new manager will happen within a month.
maguire fault
Ole out💯
The board brought ronaldo! Maybe you just shite
The performance was totally awful today😢😢😢
I don’t live in England so I can’t, but I’m begging the fans in Manchester please start protesting again because we need change and we need it now
Love the passion dude ! Say it !
The owners have backed United - FACT Mark in denial by blaming the owners - FACT  Da Gea - 50mil Wan Bisaka - 50mil Verane - 40mil Maguire - 80mil Shaw - 35mil Matic - 40mil Pogba - 90 mil Fernandez - 50mil Sancho - 75mil Greenwood - worth 40mil Ronaldo - priceless Ole not good enough - FACT
Stop Solskjaer from staying at United
I can't even talk about this crap today, absolutely shattered!!
🤣🤣🤣
Why r u guys so pressed over him not saying Ole out 😂😂
I feel for Ole. He did what everyone including you Mark wanted, and played Matic and Pogba in the midfield, and it was still terrible.  It's hard to say that it's his fault for MacGuire and Shaw's dips in form. Because one could say he was equally the cause of their good form. Although I can see there's an argument he fatigued them. MacGuire's terrible mistake didn't look like fatigue though.  Our passing was so inaccurate. Leicester took the ball off us at will,  and split us apart at will.  We looked  turgid, disorganised, and panicked, and Ole is ultimately to blame for that, and we can say that's because he has never been a proper manager. But we looked terrible with Van  Haal and Jose too. They're proper managers. No way back for Ole now though, his luck has run out.
Greedy Greenwood
We need a manager with competent coaches who can create a pattern of play, players need to know where they need to run and know that the service will come. Our team is clueless and slow.
Totally I agree. Team selection based on Favourites
Let’s face it,lecister stoped our strikers getting the ball,fair play,great tactics.
You want glazers out even though they got you Sandhu, varane and Ronaldo?
I just love the way marks family gets involved.  Seb you’re a legend
Mark..are you oles PRO...ole get out
You aren't irrelevant!
Ole in, please
And what is replacement if sack Ole?? Goldbridge? Name a top class manager who is availabe now
What a joke, blame the owners, they gave this man everything he wanted, Varane, Sancho, Ronaldo and he still can win games, what more can the owners do, just say it man, OGS needs to go.
If ole loved this club he should step down and let a proper coach come in
🤣🤣
Ollie is just not good enough
‘I normally do a tactical breakdown, today, i think it would be a nervous breakdown.’ 😂
Ole in. The best we ever had.
Brought in Cavani, Ronaldo, Bruno, Sancho, Pellistri, Diallo, James, Donny, Telles, AWB, Varane, Maguire and we still blame the board. We can't Change the board or the Glazers but Ole has been poor for a long, Ten Haag is way better.
not to worry !!! I Understand Utd sold a few more Ronaldo shirts in Azbekistan !!!
Today showed you that Fred is not the problem
Marks best vids are when hes passionate. This is a classic
Anybody that wanted Jose out deserves this.
It  is  ok  only  the  8rh  game a  long  way  to  go   ole  in   give  ole till  end  of  the  season       every  good  manager  have  a  bad  day   .     Liverpool suffer   last  season  .
!HAHA OLE AT THE WHEELLLLLLLL GET HIM TO SIGN A 50 YEAR CONTRACT NOW
It's fans like you Goldbridge (sentiment fc) who has caused the lack of unity. Ole's crap from last season and we ole outers have been crying out for change. But no u ole inners because of blind sentiment have to wait one more year to see he's crap and clueless. Then u accuse us outers as not being real fans because we want better for our club. GET RID OF HIM NOW. We can still save this season. If we all unite it will work.
All you Man who fans at the start of the season 😂
OLE is a mess
Love OLE ❤️
Ole at the wheel lol
Ole wasn't the one on the pitch... Players didn't turn up today. Same players that stabbed Mourinho in the back
Mark don't fool yourself. Man United is finish.
100% backing a  poor manager = 100% bad board and owners
I love ole I love ole I love ole
No such thing as a manager Fergy and wenger were the last successful managers.. Jose done his own tactics so does pep and klop.   All head coaches . United a fucking joke not to have the very best in charge
OLE OUT
So pogba gets a pass again from mark
All we do is just a joke 😩😣
CAN ANY OLE'S KEYBOARD CHAMPION EXPLAIN WHATS OLE'S TACTICS OR HOW HE WANTED TO PLAY TODAY.
Please move him on before people start abusing him. He s never been up to this level, he's done his best , thank u , goodbye
I'm officially ole out as of now I can't defend him anymore it's not just this performance today. We have had to many performances like this and today we got found out.
Thanks for everything Ole you will always be our legend. Board please do it now its early enough to make things right!
BOBBY AND SALAH WILL PUT THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN NEXT SUNDAY 😄😄😄
You know what will b funny is if united lose to spurs Liverpool Chelsea and Atalanta and ole is still coach
Relying on individual brilliance from the front line but getting let down by individual mistakes in the backline  We don't have a midfield and teams with quality like Youri Tielemans just pass straight through us and run the entire game against us   What a way to start this run of games, Ole Solskjaers back is really against the wall now
Ole is a joke
All City do is pass the ball around. They don't have a style of play. They pass it around and hope a player does something spectacular. Isn't that all they do? and their "pressing" is just a gamble. Ole could've tried to do the same, he's just too cautious.
Ole would struggle to get tune out of Brazil 1970 team
Mark's analysis has become as inconsistent as Arsenal.
Mark's analysis has become as inconsistent as Arsenal.
Ole OUT !!! Mark come on ….
Blaming the Glazers is lately become an unfair adage, That team has no pattern,no style,no coordination whatsoever, basically NO IDENTITY, honestly i don't know whats being coached at Carrington. Ole and his crew have failed us
Things need to changed fast
17:14 long ball FC 😂
Why do match going fans like singing "Ole's at the wheel" it's sickening
Ole out. Stop Trying to blame everything or deflect the problems everywhere else. He's done fam
Just accept Ole Out
Need Zidane in now before the season is gone.
The “that’s the worst performance we’ve seen in a long time” comment has become a regular over the last 7 games.
OLE in greatest manger
United doesn't even have a playing style no tactics the players are just confused we need to replaced Ole
Pogbas comments shows ole is losing the team
Get rid of Harry Maguire...a great man once shouted😂🤣😂🤣
All you sentimental twats pat yourselves in the shoulder 👏👏👏 bravo and you lot that are so called “ we’re the real fans because we live in England “ clap your hands too because you allowed this club being run downed by these owners. # EveryoneOut
Ole out!!!!!!!!!
Ronaldo is also not the same ronaldo when he first was at man utd He is still a good player but you see he is past his prime  Young ronaldo would win us some matches but this ronaldo  Not
Personally I would let Pogba go, for all the talent he loses the ball far too often and he Greatly imbalances our midfield playing in the deeper role
Same old bollocks from Mark. For having a channel based on opinion you fairly shy away from your opinion on Ole.
5:30 sebs clip thank me later
Who cares about player ratings, the entire team was garbage.
How is this fool still manager???? Oh Lord
"it's not football, we aren't watching football at Manchester United" 😂😂😂I love the match reaction buddy, sorry for your loss 😢🎂
Mark a Ole In supporter. Buts too weak to say it.
Ole ole ole
You are a coward. You are Ole out from everything you are saying, but you will not say it. You are protecting your channel
The glazers are a cop out lol the real person is ole that needs to go.
Funny thing he says he won't say Ole out even though his whole reaction spells exactly that!
4-2-3-1                                   Ronaldo  Rashford                   Bruno                     Sancho                 Pogba                       Mctominay  Shaw                                                               A-W-B                     Maguire            Varane                                      De Gea
Goldbridge bingo: ‘We’re Manchester United!’ ‘Ole hasn’t got a clue’ ‘I won’t say ole out’ ‘If you’re ole out based on this result you need to have a look at yourself ‘ Bonus: ‘Man city are irrelevant I don’t care about them at all’
I will blame both the glazers and the couch because if players are playing what the couch hasn't told them to play so what is the use of the coach.
How many from the 9 points?  Moron / Marky G: *Eight* Sane person: 0  :D
Still blaming the glazers . How much they spent again ?
If the Glazers were good owners, Ole wouldn't be a problem. He would not be the manager. What was Ronaldo thinking when he came back
"We got one of the best players that ever lived upfront",classic vintage goldbridge 🤣🤣🤣strikes again (enjoying my pop corn)
Oles logic in his head will be like we lost because Fred wasn’t playing
Ole's tactics have never won us a game i really don't remember one game
Liverpool, Chelsea and City on fire but United is on cold and cannot be in the title race. Get a manager who can match the top dogs.
Bruno will always have awful goals but that shitty manager never ever brings on van de beek to give us something different from what bruno was offering
Anybody who doesn’t want Ole out at this stage is completely delusional. This has to stop. We have a good squad now so it’s the perfect time to get him out and bring a manager who can bring the best out of these players
Thumbs up but it was painful to listen the entire thing coz truth hurts.
If getting battered by Liverpool brings the sack I’m okay with that
I'm just here to hear Mark say he is not Ole out 😂😂😂
Coaching is what SAF did with the likes of Cleverly and Evans, making average players play well in your system and style of football. Ole right now neither has a style nor does he coach.
We were watching basketball 😡😡😡😡. It's the coaching every day same game so predictable sit behind and counter then you smash man u.every team playing man u now knows what to do to smash ManU 😡😡😡😡😡
100% agree
My local team Peterborough United lost 2-0 at Middlesbrough today and played so much better than United today. Bloody disgrace.
Stop complaining about Glazzer,if you can't go change the club.Why would they move on from1 of their fortune.Only way they sold is the buyer come with tripple price.
Mark was able to call Mourinho out but can’t bring himself to do the same to Ole. Ole has far much better squad than what Van Gaal and Mourinho had.
Well said mark
Mark is in too many pockets. Simple as that
The top 4 race mentality leads to arsenal
Guys we need to push for a glazers out harder then ever I mean protest week in week out every game and get them out PLZ PEOPLE IN MANCHESTER AND UK GET THEM OUT
I really don't see changing the manager as the answer! No manager will do any better for me! I don't know the answer, I just don't see changing the management as the answer!
Oh well 😂 you Ole inners. Back the manager no matter what. Top reds say we Ole outers aren't real fans because we're not from Manchester. Well there. Hope ur proud of your stupid f..king manager now.
OLE OUT from a Norwegian who knows the mechanics behind the fraud.
How has it taken some people this long to realise Ole is a PE teacher
Solkjaer  has to go  his coaching staff and imagine bruno leaves ronaldo leaves this team is broken,  he as to go
OUT OUT OUT
Liverpool cant wait for next weekend
If you're playing Matic sitting you need McT or Donny alongside him to make up for his lack of legs. Can't be playing with Pogba and Bruno 50 yards away most of the match. We needed a world class holding midfielder this summer before anyone else.
Sean Dyche or Steve Bruce would get a better tune out of this team
Ole's at the wheel 🤣
The players are letting him down.
Long balls 😅😅😅😅 even my village team plays better football
Mark, I called this continuation of a s*** show last year the way Ole was managing the club the pathetic brand of football if he had any and the style that is absolute garbage third level division and no one, two, or three top players would have changed anything.  We are now seeing that exact thing, the sh*t show, continue  the way that I predicted.
OLE OUT  OLE OUT OLE OUT.    Glazers aren't leaving, so you can either say it or continue to  win nothing.  Your choice.
Leister plays better football
Ole should go for better results
Yea its not working , teams have improved, utd might need a new manager, but who? Zz conte nah its a difficult situation but ole has to go , so sad , what a player, just cant have those results..........
Glazers out? How much did he spend this summer? What more do you want from them?
A title race, we are not even in a race for the Europa league right now, Ole must go he isn’t good enough and I would like  Conte as manager, he is Man Utd level in my opinion and even more probably
We have pogba, bruno, cr, the best gk in the world, varane.... And still got trashed!
👀 Damn aint a single Ole inner in sight here
More time for ole, more problem for man utd.
Sack Ole and Ronaldo ! Yesterday’s men.Ronaldo way passed his sell by date zzzzzzzzz😞
Sancho player rating 5
Ole Out!!!!
5:28 lol
Rashford did more in 15 minutes than Sancho in 9 GAMES!!
Relegation
The Glazers were ot playing. CR7 and Bruno Fenarndez were......
One thing that nobody is saying but it was clearly visible today - Maguire is bollocks. If we hadn't stupidly paid so much for him and stupidly made him captain, he would have gone the way of Dan James by now.
Is Lingaard better then Amad Diallo?
If ole is not changing the tactics and being stubborn, how can we not ole out?
Pogba just has no interest in defending at all, that’s why Ole plays him on the wing, it’s not his fault but he’s a weak spot in games like this. You guys should actually consider whether he’d be good at any team in the prem other than City and maybe Chelsea
Ole makes David Moyes look like Pep Guardiola and Alex Ferguson combined. Ole is the worst manager in the world.
Speaking the truth
LOOOOOOOL this is hilarious to watch. Listening to so many say United would win the league just cause they signed Ronaldo.. Like he would improve their whole starting XI. He's a poacher now. Nothing else. Still an OK team with a sh*t coach.
mark you are fighting the wrong battle the glazers did their job in the summer and ole has failed today has shown us that he is not good enough other clubs have worse owners ole has failed us all its time to let go
Bounce back fc
16.15 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jose definitely would win the title with this squad. I’m tired of ole’s management, he’s simply clueless.
We bought sancho as right winger.  Rashford back and sancho on the left.  Rashford swapped with sancho onto the left. Wan basaka can not cross. Ole trainung him to push forward and he cant do it and now his tackling has gone tits up with no confidence. Sancho should be ahead of wan basaka end off.  One direction ole fc
Ole must go, the guy doesn't know what he's doing, who can say they enjoy watching man united play? Yes players have their own short coming but Ole is the reason the team is bad
CR7 WAS A BAD SIGNING. Man didn't do nothing all game no movement by him. Cavani should be the starter over cr7
Very nice of Ole to rest CR7 for Portugal. A true gent .
Even a mediocre coach would have corrected their mistakes by now. I was an Ole supporter and I don’t think him leaving will equate to results or titles. But he’s not doing the fundamentals of his role. And worse still, he seems to be refusing to learn from his mistakes.
GenerationalTalentBridge
Ole Fucking Out
Supporting united for the glory years the players that made this club great, sir Alex, cr7, scholes, giggsy, Beckham, Rooney, van persie...
If I'm Eric Bailly tonight, I wanna get on the phone tonight, and get Man United and Ole charged with fraud. 😂😂
The Scandinavian Noddy!!! Noddy No Tactics!!! Noddy No Clue!!! ;D
Ole face says it all.  Fergie riled players to get that extra step out of each player.  Ole cuddles men.  Sorry ole but belt up and roast these lads down the training pitch daily or forget it and resign.  No drills in passing. No expression no fire in the belly.
Ole in he’s at the wheeeeel
come on mark!! ole has destroyed worse then anyone period!!!
Out now its time
It's not relegation form but it is DEFINITELY sackable form.
The only way to lift United is to get Conte and his men in and funding his ambitions
I think McFred not being there was a huge loss
Glazers out
50+million players all over the pitch. Can’t blame Ole for everything. Sancho looks mediocre at best.
He has to go
Mendy>de gea 🤫🤫🤫
dont want to hear anything ever again against McFred . Now you know! Without Varane, Lindelof and Maguire against top 6 NEED MCFRED!!!! Matic and Pogba cannot do it
Great match ratings, Lindelöf maybe couldve got a 5.
Glazer out
Mark:I'm not saying they need to sack Olé.  Also Mark:(INDIRECTLY) Olé out.
I really  hope ole  see this show i really hope so
We are becoming ‘coming back stronger FC’ I don’t know but Ole is so clueless😬🤭but the fact is we seriously need a strong CDM.😤
Man u were never in the title race.
In other words Goldbridge you have finally admitted  Ole's clueless
Conte gets you challenging for a title. It's that simple. Pay him what he wants
Yeah but you're Ole in Dumbbridge
ole out!
Rashford a fantastic player lol. WHAT? Rashford is one of the worst players I've ever seen at MU a headless chicken who's been used as a leftist politician by his publicity team. He should have been sold by now, he produces nothing every season.
Ole Out that simple 🤷🏽‍♂️
Newcastle will win the premier League before us. Let that sink in
Im confident i could manage ..Henderson, Dalot, Bailly, Lindelof, Telles, Matic, (and whichever donkey doesnt start in 1st team) Lingaard, VDB, Martial, Cavani....and beat Oles team
United won’t even be top five by the end of the weekend. Lol.
Goldbridges three Fs is the best summary of Oles and one as manager 😂
Ole in.
Enjoyed this
GLAZERS OUT ARE YOU THICKKKKK, THE SQUAD OLE HAS SHOULD NOT BE PERFORMING HOW IT IS , WE GOT PLAYERS NOW, 70M SANCHO  50M VARANE WOT MORE DO YOU WANT , DOESNT MATTER IF WE SIGNED HAALAND OR DECLAN RICE OLE CANT CUT IT
Scott and Jessy need to be sold.
Ole is a big failure at United.
Mark says Ole should resign, but he won't say Ole out. Don't they mean the same thing? 🤔🙄
Ole luck is drying out.
I’m feel
I have lived to watch the Glazers and Ole destroy the club I love.We will lose Ronaldo.
Ole is way out of his depth
This team reminds me of the last episode of the Young ones and Ole is at the wheel crashing the bus over Cliff.
'It's about the Glazers' 'they sign a couple of players & you buy the shirts' *promotes his sons shirt on twitter*
My concern is Ronaldo. What is he thinking rn? "Should I have gone to City"? Because he's surely not winning anything this season
Ole will get us relegated if we continue  to play like this.
Still wonder why Man Utd buy Sancho with 75m? They have a better player than sancho in their reverse team, i think...
We will not beat Liverpool . Man City  and Spurs under ole.
LMAOOOO dead club 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mark’s funny and he doesn’t even try to be
Still don't know why United bought Ronaldo, holding midfielders would be my choice
Blame the Glazers who has give you all the players you wanted still no good.
Why everyone saying Ole out. He is fantastic coach. He is not responsible for the lost. We have world class expensive player. They didn't deliver. Ole didn't play in field. He is fantastic Manager. Respect 🙌 and Ole should in. Stop talking OLE OUT, this is not good for the team . love Manchester United  ❤💖💗 Ole.
Mark, imagine if this were Jose. Your reaction can never be same. United as a football club and  fans are political party.
I will say this one more time and I will not repeat it! Ronaldo does not suit the Premiere League and our team.  Yes, Ole is a horrible Manager but he makes us worse BECAUSE we will NOT be able to press and press effectively.   When we don't press, teams will press us like Leicester did and when the team have the ball in the defense and we don't press they get to get into our final third with any difficulty.  Then we cannot get out of our have because we are being pressed.  This will result in mistakes and us not being able to create opportunities from mistake in their half.  Contrary to Mark's suggestion that City do not press - they do high up the pitch when the lose the ball so they maintain possession and pressure.  This is how Barcelona used to play and how Chelsea and Liverpool play as well.  Ronaldo is not the problem exclusively,  he has worsen by us not having legs up front.  Watch this space...something will have to give.
please ole never leave
I dread to think what the sessions are like...🙄....what are they working on in the week?
Who would be the most realistic replacement for Ole?
Mark you are a really smart smart man !!!!
Wow the lack of football knowledge here is amazing, but at the same time I am not surprised.  Leicester have better players and a better manager. Not rocket science.
Leicester played there best game of the season today. When they play like this they can beat most teams ( on there day ). It's not that bad of a result for Man U.
Agree Mark...!! Coaching is terrible. Its not premier league quality.
Ole is good at recruiting and bringing back United culture. That's it. That's the end of his job and that's totally fine. As a coach, no.
Donny to be at the club longer than Solskjaer!
it's a fucking joke
"Friends, favourites and f*cking sh*t" 😂
This guy really hates lindelof
How Ole plays locomotive Maguire instead of Bailey then subs Matic with McTomany still baffles me
What boring game was that am tired enough is enough  bring ole out banner at oldtraffod. Next week he give us a headache everyday 😏😏  I don't want to see this boring club until ole out
cavani played in partner with Ibra, suarez, Forlan but can't partner Ronaldo? OGS most be feeling like some professional... And thank God no Fred today so y'all can see that OGS is the problem. Conte is still available
Just say it Mark
please keep Ole forever. We love him at MU.
Ole need to go long time, he have no idea about couching.
I stop watching united since Everton game I lived in Australia so I won't waste my sleep anymore to watch ole and his crap football.
Pogba out 😂
" Leicester 4-2 Manchester United! Mark Goldbridge reacts to a massive win for United. Get the latest Man Utd transfer news on The United Stand. Player Ratings Vote here    may want to change the description mate :)
The manager is an academy coach at best
Ole decision making is awful in match is awful. His recruitment is excellent he should be in charge of that etc and we need him well away from the team on match day. We need a world class coach & backroom team.
You can't blame the glazers.Ole has spent a fortune.
OLE needs to stay he is a great manager.
What was one of the Biggest Football club in the world has become the biggest joke of a club. Give Ole more time so that he can get us relegated.
I can hear your kids watching the highlights !
OLE OUT!!!!!!
Ole , the clueless one .
If Fred played today everyone would be blaming him
🚫OLE OUT🚫
Chelski, City and the scousers all have TEAMS with some talented individuals in them. We have a group of individuals, some of them highly talented, who have no clue how to play as a team.  Just watched Chelsea defend heroically in the 2nd half to win at Brentford - we would have lost that game 4-1.
But if ole loves Manchester United he should just resign
Get rid of this toxic useless manager
Wtf you moaning about Goldbridge? You were the one going on about we having better players like you did against villa. We can get beat by anybody. It's all about our shyt manager.
The Glazers are not the tacticians.
The fact that Harry Maguire is crap is the main reason, he can’t play for united without mcfred (Fact) plus ole is useless.
Ole is a joke!!! OUT
Do the glazers pick the team&tactics??? This guy is a meme
Mark Goldbridge is 100% correct .....  If man utd beat Atalanta suddenly everyone sings Ole at the wheel..Its absolutely damn ,bullshit OMG... Ole should resign himself if he is a true United Devotee..... Mark is 200% correct..... finally I saw school football today..
We lost again? Well, what’s new..guess they’re still tactically inept? Well, keep the manager and his coaching staff..they’re brilliant, aren’t they?
Ole out
Guy's and girl's. I got a good one. Listen, When the going gets tough ole gets rough. I'm loving it.... Pampers f.c. Liverpool are legends! 😀👍⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
Nobody will argue if you, Markie, can say Ole out, as this will help the momentum for Ole to get the boot
how about rooney coaching the team after ole out. based on his management of derby county.
Why doe's left footed Greenwood play on the right  and  right footed Sancho play on left?  Ole out for me I'm afraid! Gonna get trashed by the scousers, very worried 😯
Ronaldo must be regretting coming back.
Change the record Mark! The Glazers are not going anywhere so we need to go for the next level down. Ole has never been good enough and should never have got the job from day one. Ole is losing his 'legandary' status'.
This team is riddled with  brilliant individuals but it’s not a team, they were out matched and out played, no continuity, no cohesiveness, no midfield control and one has to see now that big names with huge price tags doesn’t necessarily translate to on field chemistry and it’s probably goin to get worse, longball FC
It’s not just the manager, it’s the over paid underperforming ponces.
Ole Out!!!!!!
There is something wrong at the club. It is not working. It’s October and our title hopes are based on other clubs losing. The sad part is that I am not surprised.
"There's no point being ole in or out. It's the glazers fault"  Bro wtf. You can be glazers out AND ole out.
Whatever happens Ole is laughing all the way to the Bank. Whatever happens from here, he is already financially set for like.
Move heaven and earth and get Luis Enrique in
I'm baffled how EVERYONE isn't Ole out
Tbh our midfield was not the problem. Our defence was. The old Lindelof and Maguire playing shite. Even Lindelof was bad. Varane and Lindelof was great, Maguire and Varane was decent but Maguire and Lindelof is the worst
The back stops with the coach!!....we may pretend that our problem is the glaziers but deep down we know we don't have a coach....the sooner we accept that the faster we solve the problem... meanwhile we accept the mediocrity and get satisfied with an unlikely top 4 finish....no silverware for another season
Being Ole in at this stage is like cutting your wrists. Get help.
OLE NEEDS TO RESIGN 😐
Matic was the best, easily
Ole out
I love it when people give a goalkeeper a good score when they lose.
Pogba is a part of the problem. Definitely not part of the solution. Strutting around looking like he is God’s gift to football.
Maguire  he is funny
Brighton better than Utd 😜😂😝what’s BEST for UTD I think 🤔 Utd need to get Morinhio back at least he won 🏆 something
the next five game  is really fun for ole atlanta live, spurs uuuuu good for joking thank you ole , u disgrace our team
Maguire is useless
Ole in or ole out Glazers in or glazers out  Both out for me 👍 this clubs a mess
The long ball, is literally like throwing a Hail Mary in NFL. There's no brains behind it, no tactics, just 100% pure luck. THAT IS NOT HOW MANCHESTER UNITED SHOULD PLAY.
Mark. Do us a favour and back another Club instead. You are extremely tiring.
Seeing manutd lose like this with great players.... is absolutely embarrassing 💔💔😓.....plz ole out...
MU keep losong since Selfish 7 join again...
Every year we end up complaining about the same things, even when we have a some what better side. What are the tactics going to be now.
why lingard and not van de beek brought on?
why was Matic taken off and he played very well???
It's blatantly obvious that we need a manager who is a hands on coach. Our coaching squad is embarrassing
Feel sorry for the team. Ronaldo probably regretting his decision.
Man u just have name player but dem not good enough 😂🤣🤣🤣
I rather watch BrentFord
Player rating 21:25
Just done player ratings how has ole got a 4+ rating honestly
I wasn't ole out until the villa game
Who does suit us??? The system, and style of play is ABYSMAL. Pathetic an disgusting. Get this coaching staff and ole OUT
Liverpool is coming at man u
When Fred gone it's time for Man united beat by leicester
Who do you bring in right now.
U can't even do player rating when there's no tactics it's not fair on the players, might as well just do manager rating which would be shite every week.
This guy literally said Ole out without actually saying it 🤡🤡
Ole out ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out Ole out
GET OLE TF OUT OF HERE NOW
If this was the first season, I wouldn’t be that worried.. 3rd season and with a squad that should be a top5 in the world, it’s not good enough.. I don’t mind a manager’s coaching ability is not up to par, if it’s a player that got the club’s dna and can provide with culture and identity. Ole brings none… unfortunately.. and what’s left then? He brought us out of in a dark place.. but we’re pivoting right back into that space again.
It’s why Ole doesn’t like playing Donny. Not really a player looking to play long balls at every opportunity
Get ole out now before it’s even a worse season that what it is already
United's next 9 fixtures: Atalanta Liverpool Tottenham Atalanta City Watford Villareal Chelsea Arsenal Realistically, the way we are playing football now, I cannot see Solskjaer saving his job. Enough is enough, even for the Glazers.
Ole will get sack next week lol
Doesn't mention the glazers for weeks but as soon as we lose its their fault and no clueless oles ? Mark is inconsistent this time. This loss wasn't on the glazers. Its on ole.
No players are following their positions... Defense is zero... What coaching is Ole giving to players?
talkign facts, Ronaldo should of gone to city
eric ten hag will be another koeman
Glazers won’t sack Ole because he is cheap compared to top managers. Guardiola is on £19m a year, Ole about a quarter of that.
I dont even get upset anymore... i am just suprised when we dont lose...
Mark you have made a great assessment from the bottom of your heart
David De Gea man of the match every weekend, OGS for you...
Sad time for our club after 8 games were behind Brighton. OLE LEAVE NOW
Please let's be patient with Ole.. lets give him 5 yrs more to build the team we will all be proud of.
Lingard>Donny it's not even close
I heard many times that Fred and MCt are the problem, they didn't play today. The team everyone expected failed, so what is going on, the coach is the problem he is not a championship coach level. it is very embarrassing and disappointed sacking Jose for Ole style. At least Jose won trophies for MU. You can keep Ole, but believe me he is not going to do anything for MU,. Mark Ole is not going to resign, he is a legend and you all supported him in replacement of Jose, please stop complaining. Ridiculous!!!!!
Still moaning about the Glazers LOL  They bought Sancho, Ronaldo, Varane, Pogba, Maguire, Donny and you're still moaning
I don’t like the Glazers at all but can’t blame them for Ole being totally useless as a manager. Pains me to say but Klopp, Pep or Tuchel would be doing miles better with this squad of players
You was all happy when he got a new contract.
Ronaldo is a problem to this management and will be to whoever replaces Ole. He is a brand, he gets benched and throws a tantrum.. whatever the not so competent coaching were building upfront has been greatly hampered by his signing.. there is big disconnect between the forward players... Yes the coaching is abysmal but in my opinion Cr7 was a mistake.. However he will always be the goat in my opinion..
Who do we go for if we sack ole
Ole needs to go now, not tomorrow, not monday, not next week, not at the end of the season NOW
N ; n v
At this point Marks gone so far down the rabbit hole now he can't say "ole out" even if he's thinking it 😂
Ole is a disgrace of a manager... OUT!!!!
every player is regressing... so sickening seriously. OLE OUT fast guys please
LMAO
Ole is a club legend, in 99 he helped complete the impossible. As a 5 year old I remember being on my dad's shoulders on deansgate as the bus went past unreal. As a manc since fergie retired I've watched united fall and city rise and its not a nice feeling but I will always be a red. For me Ole has to be replaced the months after Jose left were a breath of fresh air but it wasn't going to last. At the level United are at in club status and league we can't have a manager learning on the job.  Sorry Ole but you need to go.
Midfield and defence are still a shambles. Two new mids, (one CDM and one B to B) and another CB. Also, play Sancho on the RIGHT!
Leicester’s Man of the Match - Maguire 👏👏👏
MY HEART BROKE TODAY. BEING CHEATED ON DOES NOT HURT THIS MUCH
MU FC = Ole United FC
After careful consideration OLE needs another 5 years contract
I don't know whether it's me or other man utd fans feel this defeat even didn't hurt like others feel like it's going to be a loss or draw coming each week no matter what team we play.
Ole out
No doubt the board and owners are horrible and need to go But Ole has had time to learn now, he should have improved now it’s not that hard to see we have no style of play and he also has the power to say his coaches are shocking and need to go but hasn’t because he’s clueless and conned in way in, we should have wait till the end of that season to give him that contract because as soon as he signed it the warning messages showed up in performances
What would have Jose done with all that backing?
Ole out
Man United died when that cheat Alex Ferguson left that pathetic club
You are saying Ole out ie ‘he should resign’  sic  ‘the board should sack him as Chelsea etc would
I concur - Ole is just a smoke screen. The Glazers are the problem. Until they leave this will be the circus.
Crap from top to bottom Time to piss on this team stop buying shirts and gadget hit them financially
My Saturday is complete Liverpool win 5 - 0 and the manc shite get wolloped 4-2
He was saying Manchester United going to win 2-1 that tells how much you know about our team
The glazers thought the had a stroke of brilliance with signing Ronaldo. In reality, now, the fans will be fuming if we don’t start contesting for trophies.
I still think when fans don't have ownership this will still happen.
Don't start crying now goldbidge about we let the owners off the hook. You and all man u fans at the start of the year was acting like you are title contenders,  your fanbase starting buying Ronaldo shirts at record pace never seen before. Now you are complaining.
Made by OLE🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭 💩💩💩
Sancho is so shite 😂😂
Mark finally saying Ole out ! Without saying it. Lol
"Man United might not thank me, but get the contract out, put it on the table, let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there -- given what he's done since he's come in -- and let him sign the contract and go. Ole's at the wheel, man -- he's doing his thing. Man United are back!"
Ole is climbing to his roof to turn on the nev signal.. Gary takes up his phone after seeing the signal. “Siri find me another excuse for ole please..” it would interesting to hear what excuses ole’s pals can come up with now….
If Ole had integrity, he would resign tomorrow.
Anyone remember when Mark said United wernt conceding goals he was worried about 😂 1 clean sheet to liverpools 5 and cities 6
How can you blame the glazers today - to be fair they provided some good players but Ole can’t get a tune out of them
Olé admitted that he is learning on the job. Can we afford to have an apprentice manager ?
I can't understand your view..... You say EVERYTHING is the Glaziers fault and then quite rightly say the way we are set up on the pitch and perform is terrible????   Pogba and Fred are S**t and always have been.  Matic is too old.  McTominay is a good player in need of support.
Ole in!!!!!
Just say it
Pogba is essence calling for the managers head
Ole out
‘Mark Goldbridge reacts to a massive win for United’   Please edit your video description :)
“The people you need out the club are the glazers” bro they don’t manage the team tactics etc etc, wtf
You will continue fuming and crying as long as Ole is the manager for I now already know dat Ole is sheet and waiting for him to resign
Missed Fred today lmao
MU are good for Las Vegas circus show....Be happy because MU win with West Ham....in champions league....etc...! What happent today it s just normal...!
at last. The storm has gained enough momentum to finally sweep away Ole. When something is not good enough it's a matter of time before irretrievable failure.
You gave maguire 4 out of 10, the only reason he should get a 1 rating is because zero isn't given an as option. The worse performance I've seen from a captain in years, he should be dropped, and eventually moved on.
You can have another legend in Bruceless as your next manager.
Brendan Rodgers is some manager! Hate to say it.
Why not the criticism for Pogba Mark? Other than Maguire he was the worst player on the pitch. He played for advance than Matic and did absolutely nothing. Continuously gave the ball away, have away far too many fouls, and always needs 5mins on the ball to do anything decent. Lazy and entitled. Club will be better off with the mercenary leaves.
And they took the plane to Leicester from manchester to play this game and served us up with that crap Ole is embarrassing the club left-right and center
Obviously the management isn’t good. So if you want to win, get successful management. Solved!  The players have quality overall. Ole needs to realize he’s not the quality we need and resign. I would respect him for that. But none of this matters unless the ownership demands excellence. If it’s just Top 4, forget it.
Great game, as a Liverpool supporter I couldn't be more happy, The Scandinavian Noddy has lost the plot, Ole hasn't got a clue, your players aren't arsed and it's amazing to see, it was a really entertaining game though, especially how you played, sorry, I really enjoy your football commentary Mark, you're really on it so no disrespect, you're team are a bunch of overpaid superstars and eh Pogba's hair, are you kidding me??? ;D
How many games we need to lose  before we get rid of our manager, who proved many times that he is not the man for this job? He was not the man from day one.
Our players are demoralised. Not playing in a decent system, know they should be better than they are playing and are lost. Ole and his boys need to go to revive the season.
And Paul Pogba... Time to move on bro. You've really done your bit. You have tried hitherto. Madrid needs you NOW!..
You're giving Pogba too much credit he's just repeating what Ole told them after the match if he actually believed any of that shite he might show it on the pitch from time to time.
I just can't believe this guy 🤡🤡
if ole still respects himself and then he should resign tonite
Ole just bought players that other clubs were interested in
Is it only me who has a 4.9 rating on ole on the website
Oh come on mark if you grew a pair said ole out on your big platform and your season ticket holders called for ole out at games it would happen. You’re spineless you’re a squeaky little man.
Let's face it Maguire is not a footballer
I'm tired of hearing Ole promised Lingard , Bailly , Mata e.t.c games as if they are blind to see the kind of squad we've got and know the kind of Coach Ole is .. If we fans can see that Lingard , Van de beek , Mata , Bailly e.t.c won't get enough game times i wonder why they can't see that themselves..
For the ones who wanted Pogba in the pivot 🤣🤣 that midfield was a highway
🤑🤑🤑
Doesn't matter who we sign. Look at the players we have in defence, it is a complete mess. I don't want to hear about signings until the team looks organised, and that is not going to happen with Solskjaer.
Start with five English players  you win nothing, Chelsea,  Liverpool and man city are good examples.
I still can't believe this trainee manager Ole has lasted all these years as manager of one of the world's biggest clubs. Unreal!
Maguire had the worst game of his life atrocious
Couple things to take from this season  We don’t have a perfect midfield pairing  Bruno plays as a second striker hardly in the midfield  Maguire has been shaky nearly every game Ole is clueless  Ronaldo has changed the way we play
Individual player brilliance saved Ole and the team last season.. No doubts. The Red lights could've shown back then too... Sighs...
Excuse me, but I have to say: RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE
Ole Gunnar is the worst coach is the prem
Really fucking hate watching us play like this. Moments FC for both goals and midfield ain't got no fight. No matter who we play, we make them look prime Barca or Madrid. Ole is out of his depth and the coaching is terrible and it shows in the way we play. Depressing stuff
I rather watch paint dry
Hahhaahahaha you give Lindelof and Maguire both 4. You are so bias Mark its not even funny...
25:55 when you realise the already defensive manager is switching to a back 5
Spot-on. Abramovich didn't have time for loyalty and nostalgia; he got rid of Lampard and won the champions league. If anything, Abramovich did Lampard a favour by sacking him, otherwise he'd have ended up tarnishing his legacy in the same way Ole is doing now. The guy won the lottery when they gave him a permanent contract; he should never have been gifted such a massive job. United should dump him and try to get Simeone.
I’ve never been on the train but enough is enough….ole out!!
GOLDBRIDGE is ole out always has been he doesn't need to say the words anyone with half a brain knows he is and wots the point he is gone now anyway
Why do you think Antonio Conte refused to be linked to the Newcastle job?. Conte will be in charge as of Monday at Man utd. Thats the job hes been waiting on.
Not to worry. Good vibes will save us.
Ole needs to go...... now ...and take maquire and Fred with you... clueless and shocker...  not shocked.
the best solution for man united formation is 4-3-3 or 4-4-2
🤔Now,  tactically speaking, I think feeders' team coaches have a limit. I clearly remember Lampard's case as  well last season.. Thank God for the prudence of the Chelsea BOD.. No one'd like to have imagined where Chelsea would be found at the end of the season.
I started seriously doubting Ole when he didn’t prioritise a midfielder… now this. He must resign.
Fire Ole!
I’m sick of pundits always saying that lindelof is the problem in united’s defence, ‘if Maguire’ had someone decent along side him’ maguire is the problem! And the fact he’s captain is staggering. Sure he had a decent euros but it papers over the cracks season after season
There’s a reason why Ole has been relegated with Cardiff. Had enough of him, I rate him as a player but not as a manager🤮
How the board didn’t see that this dude is clueless is really beyond me ,way beyond me .
You did everything apart from actually admit you want Ole out, and thats ok, I want Ole out but your fear of saying them words is becoma little embarrassing for you pal. Great podcast and a great show today, agree with everything you said
In Molde his best seasons were when he had injuries so he could not rotate. When he had his best squads he rotated them into 3rd, 4th and 5th place. Decent but with Moldes budget and players faaar below expectations. The seasons he won titles he actually was forced to not rotate. So he gets the best out of «lesser» players when he is forced to make it simple. Being «underdog» because of injuries despite top notch budget and «forced» to play counter attack football.
Ronaldo will know how martial felt
Stop blaming the manager, just like you told Arsenal
OLE OUT GLAZERS OUT 💀💀
Why don't we play 4-4-2 with Ronaldo and Cavani on top? Cavani will create more space for Ronaldo
Ole out no cap
I really did believe OLE learnt so much about management behind the scenes under Sir Alex Ferguson...but the only thing he has the same as sir Alex is in dressing room red faced anger shouting swearing but now I have no choice but to admit it's not enough something is wrong I thought ole had tactical ability and knowledge but unfortunately it's becoming clear he not sure tactically he isn't even getting quality advice something I very wrong ole is gone after Liverpool so sad
36
When I saw goldbridge's face on the thumbnail. Me being like😂😂😂😂😂
From a neutral perspective, I’d love to see Ole do well. Nothing better than a young manager and club legend succeeding. But he’s been riding his luck in games for a long time, now it seems the luck has run out. Some of the tactical decisions from him are genuinely Championship level
The opposition constantly run through Pogba and Matic
Spent 200M in a transfer Call Man City Oil City Play Europa League  Repeat
And Mark will still blame Glazer's instead of Ole 🤣😅😂😅🤣 absolutely sheet
Matic is ded
Why did we buy Sancho? To play support passes?
Eat humble pie as you were confident UTD would win this game…
I would to see Roy Keane as manager
FRED WAY BETER THN MATIC SO IS FRED
hear me out. mctominay and Fred miss out today, and 4 goals conceded, and a loss.
I hate Glazers but let's not talk bs here.  He's been backed but I agree ole is done. There no reason we should be here.
Just chill we are trusting the process 😆😆😆😆
Ole’s got no tactical neuce. 4-2-3-1 is our down fall. I have said it many times. Apart from the fact that the players are good but clueless as to what is needed and thats down to the manager.
They just bought oli Ronaldo , Varane and Sancho how is this the owners fault 🤣🤣
Bruno's effect with pogba and matic isn't there
You lack serious pace. Very slow team
There's a saying that says a builder can have the best tools, if they work sh@t then the tools are sh@t
Despite all this the golem will get his players so inspired and motivated and beat Liverpool. That’s what annoys me the most, he goes that extra yard against us
Why is mark hiding his Ole Out, talking round and round , just hit the nail on the head mate .. It's time for Ole to go..
Fred has to play.of the ball we were poor we can't press with that team
If you're still Ole in then your the problem of Manchester United
The team played uninspired, and our midfield was broken in two by the 60th minute in the second half. Maguire and Pogba were awful today. Overall, just disappointing.
Why is this guy so dumb how has man united ever been considered been in a title race they have been shocking for the past 8 years
As others forgot their duty degea remembered his 😑😑
I don't understand why the fans in the stadium are still singing "ole on the wheel" with this bad game and results...there's no hope for this club anymore, this team is not going anywhere this season.
Ronaldo isn’t good enough
Its the "HOPE" that kills us and its clear as day he just aint good enough!!
United's problem is not the manager! It is playing a striker who past his sell by date long ago in most competetive league in the world! Cavani would do alot better!
SIIIUUUU!!!
Man Utd saved their ass against Wolve, West Ham and Villareal. The series of poor performances continues. Next up, you fall back to reality!
United seems to be doomed we cant do anything
'Hello darkness my old friend' 🤣😂🤣😂
Our defense on set pieces never ever improves
No worries United won the game today delusional.
Ole needs to go..we needs to win
The glazers have given every manager over 350 million, massive mistake to get ole totally out of his depth
Ole: Just give the ball to Ronaldo! Players: Boss, we can't keep the ball!
Ole must go, we need a big ego manager to manage this team full of superstars.
Ole out no problem.....gimme NAMES to replace him
If you're irrelevant, why did you say LVG out? Are you doing what you're accusing the Glazers of doing? Putting up with Ole because of his history with the club?
Thats what happens when Pogba plays in midfield
It's just way too embarrassing. No pattern to our play. Maguire can't be our captain, that's a shame itself. You need someone who has the Man U DNA!
Spot on Mark, but Ole is not bigger than the Club, just have the courage to be Ole out... Your  reviews say Ole out but you won't say it... "Ole out" say it and it will set you free....
Ole outers should be so happy cause afterbwe loose or draw to Liverpool the board will sack him as fans will demand it so you got ur wish finally
In 1999 he stuck his leg out and got lucky.
Am so glad Fred wasn't part of this mess...
Ole In 😉
Today was a great disappointment from those players
Erik ten Hag about his future, after being named as possible manager of Juventus and Barcelona: " I am enjoying my job here at Ajax. I don't see myself leaving, I love being at Ajax!"   Do what you want to do with that statement. I am telling you, it takes a bit more than possible to persuade him from taking another job, away from Ajax.
OMG
Leave Ole alone. He's playing a blinder.
So from what I understood from this is that he is Ole out but not Ole out😂
Bring back mourihnio
So it's not Martial, it's Ronaldo, too
Ole will be gone within 5 weeks or definitely in the first week of January. Get down the bookies and place your bet. Utd will then head hunt Brendan Rodgers!
This is the first big team United have faced and they got battered. Dont get me wrong, Arsenal (my club) are an utter shambles at the minute but I think both clubs are facing the same problems, unfortunately. It is the same problem; ownership.
Stop blaming the Glazers. They have done well enough under Ole. We just been selfish blaming the Glazers for Ole’s failure. In fact Manchester United fans should start giving them some credit at least. Ole is simply not good enough. He should have gone in the summer but they left him. Sacking him now will be bad business for United. They know this as well but he is got to GO!!!!!!
He's taken us as far as possible. Assembled the squad for the next attacking manager. Time to let ole go
this is what they deserve for not buying a good cdm.
We need a real CF and maybe a new manager too
Totally agree with everything you said 💯💯💯
Now Rashford is back. Another headache 😔😔
Ole ole ole ole mark it ain’t the glazers it the fooking useless manager get him out
Ole IN...Absolute fucking Banter FC...
Im officially Ole out. Im a norwegian, Ole was my hero growing up, Ive got all the respect for him as a club legend. But he just isn't good enough. He needs to go.
This match simply proves that McFred is the best midfield pairing that Utd have !
Making seb sad is the last straw
Goldbridge: The problem is not Ole out! Ole: Here's your bags, lad.
What a Prat!!! blaming the glazer's after signing Ronaldo, Varane and Sancho, what more do the owners have to do? oh why not coach the dam team as well. Goldbridge you are delusional if you can't see the biggest problem at the club, Ole and his entire coaching team. Pep did not get  a striker or a left back,  Liverpool only signed one player yet look at the football they play now compare that to that shite we play.
I prefer Luis Enrique to Zidane and Conte
Utd have been really poor this season and lucky to get some of the wins they got so far especially the win over us! This result was coming
Am not happy we lost, BUT I did say if Lester. Arse-null or the totties have a half decent season, at current form. We could be in a scrap for forth place.
Mark i strongly disagree with you it isn't the glazers in charge of coaching the team ole is just not good enough to take us forward.mark I think it's time u call it ole out
Ole's bandwagon is getting a bit light.
You can’t blame the glazers mark that’s bs they bought you quality players Ronaldo sancho and varane and ole still can’t do nothing with them
The Glaziers are not the Manager.
OLE OUT
Martial should play diffence
Man U owners overpays a LOT. The fanbase is deluded if you think owners are the actual problem here.
Wasting the worlds best players with the leagues most inexperienced coach. Every match is like a boring movie  Mark I told you on Thursday not to underestimate Leicester City knowing how clueless ole is
I'm from Hong Kong. You are right. Hong Kong is very much like China now. Police state, barbaric communism and detained human rights activists.
By the way we are not going t beat Atalanta
Our main problem is ole tactical and glazer
Ol e out
Nowadays... any team on EPL who need point will gladly to face MU..please Give ole another 5 years contract.. 😝 😝 😝 ✌ ✌
I'm not sure if ronaldo had a bad game or he's finished
Ole has been worst than Van Gaal and Mourinho because he has a better squad of players.
Can they talk to Luis Enrique?
How many times have said.. Ole and his management team will never get the best out of the players we have or players we bring in .. but I’m sure the players on the pitch know what they need to do and don’t necessarily need direction in the game..
So it's irrelevant to say ole out   but not glazers out ???
Maguire was crap again but he's getting away with it on this channel again. He is not good enough for Manchester United, let alone captain the team. The next manager needs to get rid of him.
Ole needs more time. Ole In.
Ole needs to go it’s time for him to go . He’s not good enough he’s lost every match and we’ve got a better team get conte get zidane. We need a proper manager . Get rid of ole he’s not good enough manu going down the drawin ole is crap get ole out
I am ole out I have been since he got the job I always think mark is a hypocrite as it relates to ole but mark is right not the time to be ole out our problems are bigger than that glazers need to go
SSSIIIIIIIIIIIUUUUUUUUUU
If ole don’t go soon then we will lose pogba and donny and can’t see ronaldo stocking around with no service and probs no champs league so whoever comes in next job will be a lot harder , get rid now get a better manager like zidane or Enrique or literally anyone is an upgrade who can get the best out these players and and give time to donny and hopefully pogba will sign donny will stay and ronaldo will bang in the goals
We don’t need cr7
We dont cr7
AHAHAHAHAHHAAH OLE IS CLUELESS
Zidane in
Glazer out
This guy talk nonsense all the time he always changes his mind
Came here to laugh at Girlchester United fans. Black fans and Blackie team (Blackie Rashford, lingard and pogba) :)
Ole out
Mark saying Ole out, without saying Ole out.
This was the most shambolic of all performances and was typical of what we’ve all had to endure for much too long.  The question that needs answering is who is the right man for the job, it’s definitely not Conte.  But who do your subscribers believe is capable from those we could get?  Sadly I think they gave Phelan a new contract so they can make him temporary coach after Ole has gone…..I despair, and frankly have for most of Ole’s reign.   Another fruitless season awaits us and this when we have the best squad we’ve had for many many years.
Please leave our club olee
I love Manchester United  but not ole
Ole has to go.... Didn't understand Y he played Maguire
He is not a manager
Sorry but the Glaziers dont play for utd.Oles been given millions to spend.He has the players he wanted, so sink or swim,it all comes back to Ole and his impotent coaches.They coach the team,Ole leads the setup so hes responcible for wins and loses.If we want to end up at the right end of the table,they must go now,"Ole and Coaches."
Watching Ole manage this club is like watching someone with no arms and legs trying to swim in the deep end.
Shame on ole and coaching staff!!! Shame on maguire, shaw, ...overall shame on the glazers!!!!
We can piss and moan about Ole out till the cows come home, Ole won't get the sack anytime soon. I'd like to see Ten Haag in next though
Ole needs throw himself out of the club ASAP. He is over his head.
Finished tinpot club
Am sick of ole
If you are Glazers out you are Ole (Phelan, Carrick, Mckenna) out. Mark please call it like it is. No new owner would keep them. Ive been saying, We have NO system, tactics!! No pattern of play... these fools need to go.
Ole out ole out ole out ole out ole out ole out ole out ole out ole out ole out ole out ole out ole out ole out ole out  am sick and tired of ole he is not good enough 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
As someone has said - Individual Brilliance FC !! 😓 This isn't how a top team should play 😭
See fack you ole & wood ward out from all time from united
BAILLY AND DONNY ARE BEING THOROUGHLY DISRESPECTED
A great result for United fans because it has come to a point where the fans will only realise OLE is not cut out for the job is when United lose!
Mark saying Glazers out before Ole out is beyond me...Glazers have been terrible but this season Ole has got the best players possible and still couldn't deliver...Oleout before glazersout !!!
Glazers spent on players. Absolute millions. How can u blame them!? Yes they ultimately need to go but its on the manager. Fisher price manager.
Hey guys, I have a new book coming out this Christmas. Sweat, more sweat, and quite a lot of tears. A fans perspective of man uniteds defending
Ole out.
If ole loves the club like he says he does he leave
This may get a lot of dislikes but I have to say this,I don't think we need Ronaldo. We were a far better unit without him. Ole's tactics doesn't help us either but Ronaldo is just all hype. He does nothing extra ordinary like people make him to be.
Seb lol
😳😳😳😳 best players?? What colour is the sky in your world Mark???  Man U fans are always delusional anyway 🤦‍♂️
Cheers Ole, Seb’s crying
So you lost because of MacFred🤣🤣🤣
Lets see how delusional Mark still is. If Liverpool beat us....The only things sure in the coming weeks is that we will loose to Liverpool, Spurs and Villareal
The scary thing is we are slowly becoming Arsenal,us the fans simply watch to support,we don’t expect anything of this team anymore 🤦🏽‍♂️
The Ole wheel is out and broken beyond repair...
CR7 is a ghost on the field without tap-ins. He can't past, dribble don't press. What does he do?
Man utd on paper are suberb but on grass terrible
I'd love to see where your Leicester hate is now, Goldbridge. I suppose Man United were never really going to remain in the game 4-2 long before Leicester exposed the crap out of "title-favourites" United.
Ole is still learning and developing and has definitely become much more tactically astute he's just having bad luck atm. We have one of the best managers in the league, lets get behind him and support him. OLE IN. GGMU.
Don't forget Atalanta in the Champions League we have to win there to
The way things are going we might end up with big Sam lol
Pogba needs to go he's terrible
The sad thing is OLE himself is destroying his own LEGACY the way he is going his LEGACY as a player legend will be forgotten and all we will remember is he will be the worst MANAGER in UNITED HISTORY.
Another Ole masterclass
The problems isn't sacking Ole but who is going to replace him . Personally i would like to see Graham Porter as our manager. Look at where he has gotten Brighton to with the squad he has .
Mark stop blaming the glazers. The only thing they have done wrong is hire ole and the super league
I've noticed we have this moment around this time every season with ole and then the team goes on a huge run. But I don't see a run coming this time.
CR7 signing is the worst signing in our history. What does he offer that we didn't have before? He only make our team-worst because it's clear Ole will not get sack
Time to be honest, Mark.  Man U are a Poundland Tottenham Hotspur
Watching Mark Goldbridge when Utd lose is one of my favourite activites
Ole in
Ole out
It's simple. He is a good Feeders' Team Coach. Period. (Ole)
Throw him out asap😡😡😡😡
Ole at the wheel no midfield no supply to the fowards
Not Ole's fault. Yes he has to take some of the blame, but maguire fucked up today. That's not on Ole.
Garbage again some players are just not the grade .love olly but he's not good enough
I’m ole in but I will decide after when we play city
Manchester United are a laugh  stock   Blame fred blame mctominay but yet they didnt play ? Where was Bruno today or Ronaldo ? Or the defensive colossus that is Maguire and his trusty sidekicks shaw & AwB? 🤣🤦‍♂️ laughing stock this current squad not one decent player in this team who stand up when they need a lifeline , gone are the days or Kenae,Scholes or Ryan Giggs
Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City are so much better than you. The arrogance of your fans makes it even funnier.
Ole is barely a championship manager, it's only because we have world class players being good enough to play his crap tactics. We need a Zidane to come in and actually give us good tactics and a playing style. Zidane has shown he can win, and with this team and these CLASS players, he could do something. But our players were utter crap today.
Ole poor tactic,  he just wait 4 magic o lucky to win the match.. man utd is to big 4 ole
Liverpool could be the end of Ole
Ole is a fraud!
This is classic! It’s really simple your manager is shite. You’ve got a really good squad better than Liverpool. It’s funny 😆
Hello darkness my old friend... Ole Solskjaer strikes again 😡😡😡
The problem is you think you have a good team, you do not.
How can you blame the glazers and they’ve given Ole £450 million
Leicester outplayed us without playing any wingers..It should have been 7- 2. David De gea saved us from embarassment. Still 4 - 2 is a  embarassing score though.
I think utd are finished regarding the league title.
I'm sorry Mark. This is not on the Glazers. Yes they run the club terribly but performances like this are on the manager and his coaching staff. Period.
I'm actually looking forward to a Liverpool loss. The Titanic has hit the iceberg. Ole does not know which way to turn the wheel. We are done. Newcastle United will be the new club in top 4 😭😭😭
If the players don't know what there doing are you telling me they have confidence in Ole and the management team.
How’ can you still blame the glazers!? 😂
Ole is the current specialist in failure
Sincerely, I can't imagine Solksjaer coaching MCI, that great team by now would've been horrible. 🙄🙄🙄🤔
To all those saying, Let's give Ole Till end of season???? Lmao
I am tagging the United vs Liverpool game next weekend, "Barbarians At The Gate".
Uncle mou is coming back to haunt the glazers
Oles at the wheel. Trust him and back him
@Mark you making a mock of yourself dude stop trying be in the middle and stop bashing ppl for saying Ole out, and swearing at your viewers, I've stopped subscribing to you channel cause you just deflecting, if it was any other manager you would have said OUT when we lost the Europa League final but no you are not Ole our or Ole in, just ridiculous @Mark.
Goldbridge is an idiot. Cant he actually just man up and say it how it is. Ole OUT. He is gonna turn eventually so he might aswell just speed it up and state the truth. Cuz ole ain't getting us nowhere and he knows it
If Zidane comes, pogba might actually stay
Time for Zidane to take over
I'm not a Glazer supported by any stretch of the imagination , but let's cut the BS ..Ole has been backed in the transfer window..Nobody can say our owners have done a Daniel Levy or Mike Ashley on us , this is the season for results and Solskjaer is failing ..While the season is still somewhat salvagavable let's sack the manager and get a Zidane or Conte in .
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Halloween comes early at Old Trafford.
he managed cardiff and molde... what do you expect should have lost last week to
Who remembers the first game against leeds
Mcfred wasn't the problem. The coaching was always the problem.
How can we have great players like Sancho , Ronaldo but still losing. Its the manager that causing us problems.
I have been ole in this whole time...but what is our identity?? Why can’t we adapt in game??! Why have we got the best player In the world playing graveyard?? What are we trying to do here? I’m sorry but ole out
Ole said, we will go again
"Leicester 4-2 Manchester United! Mark Goldbridge reacts to a massive win for United." 🤔🤔
How can you say Ole should resign and he is not good enough but you are not Ole Out Mark...smh
"Ole needs to resign now"  - Mark It's official. Mark is unofficially Ole out.
Helpless United without lord Fred
God i love when united lose.
NOT Oles fault!! The players let him down today, again. His tactics were spot on, but the players failed. Oles at the wheel!
CAN WE HAVE A POLL FOR WHO WANTS OLE TO REMAIN AS THE MANAGER!!
Enough is enough.. Get rid ASAP
You can't blame this on the glazers they don't make the team sheet nor make the subs they have provided us with the players it's all oles fault
Ole out! Mark stop being on fence
i think man utd will not win champions league and premier league
Bruv you bought the new man utd kit when we signed Ronaldo, you fell for it 🙄
It's scary how many people are still supporting Ole
Its absolute shite . Ole is shite . Ole will relegate United soon
What is point of having squad depth when Ole dont want to use them. Just sick of this man and his excuses.
What's Ole excuse now, No freddy, Matic should have been playing all season, same VDB, I feel sorry for him, ole out clueless
Pogba s never been good enough, we've held on to old players to long, we need a quality hard nut in midfield who's got an engine like a train, oles time is up, a new manager with kick arse attitude is needed
Mark you are a problem if you can't say Ole Out...you expecting accountability from the Glazer but not from yourself...why should the Glazer be Ole Out but you can't say it yourself now you want to hide behind them.
Only ole can come out at the end of the game and say we deserved to win WTF seriously
ronaldo should play on the left ffs. Even for portugal he plays best when he is on the wing. Ole needs to be thrown out now . Enough is enough.
It’s Anthony martial fault and it’s mcfred fault bro this coaching staff is a joke and I am sick of it 8 years man how much long can this continue
ΔΙΩΞΤΕ ΑΥΤΟΝ ΤΟΝ ΧΑΧΑΜΙΚΟ ΤΟΝ ΣΟΛΣΙΕΡ ΤΟΝ ΑΜΠΑΛΛΟ ΚΑΙ ΦΕΡΤΕ ΕΝΑΝ ΚΑΝΟΝΙΚΟ ΠΡΟΠΟΝΗΤΗ ΡΕΕΕΕ
Ole Out The glazers won the Champions League
we’ve wasted enough years and talent under ole time to move on
McFred: I didnt play, nothing bad can happen in the game   Maguire: My time has come
salah best player in the world
Playing a Defender who just came back from injury and who just trained couple days ago, long ball fc no tactics and hoping for  moments ... he has finally made me OLE out
it’s funny how mark thinks we should wait till the end of the game to say ole out or in bruh even if we win 4:0 i would still be ole out
Simple   OLE OUT
On a positive note a beating against Liverpool might just be enough for ole to get the sack
Why ole not use 4 4 2 formation: .OLE SİUUU
Man U is out of title race already
Mark get ole out going
Mark 'on the fence' Goldbridge. Enough is enough, Ole the Wally out!
On ole I love the guy but it’s time to go if we go on to beat Liverpool and city I’ll enjoy it but looking forward it will probably just be delaying the inevitable lets just get zidane or Erik ten Hag in as soon as possible
Ole just get out just honestly sack him pls. Those who are ole out hit that like button
Embarrassment for Ronaldo and our world class players! They need to speak out!!! This is pure crap from Ole!!! Pure crap 💩
Ole out
At least that result has woke a few more up eh
I said to my mate Ronaldo could disrupt the balance of the side and here we are
Goldbridge "Play Matic & Pogba and drop McFred" that aged well.
Surly ole is gone now  has to be
David De Gea made 7 saves 4 inside the box and still conceded 4 goals  You have to strip off Harry Maguires captaincy surely
Ole isn't the man get him out And if you still back him, you're lying to yourself or you don't want our club to succeed.
Sack bilbo baggins tonight im sick of him
Shambolic. So sad to see the downfall of man united ...
The Glazers Out
“Oooo carricky does this mean I can play Fred and mctominay”  Ole just sack urself if u love the club
This is the best team we have had in years and we’re going backwards, how does this happen 😡😡😡
Leicester city destroyed u
Missing Fred in today's Game was really costly 😭 He is the Engine that keeps everything flowing! Give Ole Time to get his Best Player back 🙏 OLE IN ✔️
Fred : Thank God i can't play. Fans will crucify me . . .
Haha
Please fire him!
Enough is enough Ole out we want to see Man Utd vin trophies
unlucky mate
