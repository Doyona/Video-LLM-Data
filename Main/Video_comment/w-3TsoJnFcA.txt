Gyal, don't play hard, I know you wanna go yard with me She act like she never knew I'm a superstar Ask your girls they know who we are Shit we done to get where we are Pray and hope I don't see karma All them nights I was on my last (all them nights) I thank God thank God that's in the past  Oh Lord, show me who's true She said she seen me on YouTube I think she's done Juju Love can turn man to a fool Don't wanna meet no one new (uh-huh) 'Cause I don't know who's who (come on, come on) Show me who's true (yeah, Tion Wayne from the 9) JAE5  Yo, my life like a film She ask how I make a mil' and still go on a drill My ting in Tottenham said she wan' fuck with the real I pray my brothers mad mix, come get his appeal Only fuck with the real, only some left Was running from the old bill, now they upset If love don't really cost a thing, what's the concept? Cocktails, sipping on the beach up in Dom Rep Cases I caught were no misdemeanors How we take .44 just to lick the dealers Hid the heaters, so I kiss and treat her All our problems got smoked like Wiz Khalifa Remember twenty bag licks, I wanted it all Now for a hundred bag lick, I hang up the call But all these people show me love but want me to fall But a wise man never said nothing at all  Gyal, don't play hard, I know you wanna go yard with me (with me) She act like she never knew I'm a superstar (star) Ask your girls they know who we are Shit we done to get where we are Pray and hope I don't see karma All them nights I was on my last (all them nights) I thank God thank God that's in the past  Oh Lord, show me who's true She said she seen me on YouTube I think she's done Juju Love can turn man to a fool Don't wanna meet no one new 'Cause I don't know who's who Show me who's true  From the 9, see her step so class Every time I think about her sex, oh God She a ten, so smart, make my head go Making all my friends go, gwan Yo, all about my paper Got rich now, everybody want a favor But my babes told me, "Never put yourself in danger" Said, "You're up now, why you rolling with your shaver?" Life change from a L, free my real niggas, get the fake in the jail She acting all funny like Dave Chappelle But I see your teeth grinning when I gave your Chanel  Who's true? Don't know who's true Don't know who's true (Don't know) who's true?  Gyal, don't play hard, I know you wanna go yard with me She act like she never knew I'm a superstar (star) Ask your girls they know who we are Shit we done to get where we are Pray and hope I don't see karma (all them nights) All them nights I was on my last I thank God thank God that's in the past  Oh Lord, show me who's true She said she seen me on YouTube I think she's done Juju Love can turn man to a fool Don't wanna meet no one new 'Cause I don't know who's who Show me who's true  So gyal, don't play hard I know you wanna go yard with me, yeah She act like she never knew I'm a superstar, oh-oh-oh, yeah Shit we done, oh-yeah

To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
T-Pain influenced.
🤞🏾🏁
The way he sings the hook isnt that the same melody Stormzy uses in the hook of "Burna Boy - Real life" ?
Ummm a little too similar to T-Pain's I'm Sprung song but still a banger

Davidos bit sounded like burna boy ft stormzy - real life chorus mixed with t- pain I’m sprung chorus
🐐🐐
This song is everything, I just wished Davido was a little more original with the hook..would’ve killed it even more
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Tion Just took the quality to that next level, Popstar buisness
Heavenly Father I pray that you keep the person reading this alive, safe, healthy and financially blessed Amen
This melody is hella familiar but i can't clock it 😤
