It reminded of summer school
I like Aston villa and man city and fcb and Everton and west Brom Albion and other team I just love football I like the bird on it it like Christmas
22 stiffs.
These goals are the worse I've ever seen
Why is this in my reccommended, I don't even watch Soccer
From a Birmingham fan I’m glad you lot are doing shit absolutely tinpot club
Hello everyone
Hello
GREAT BALL! McGOLDRICK’S ONSIDE!! AND HE’S…nudged it wide.
This video gives the impression that SU deserved something from the game. West Brom never looked in any danger.
Who is that goalie? He looks like he's won a competition to play in goal for the day

It’s like West Brom gets bored of being mediocre in the Prem after a while, so they go back down to the Championship to dominate. 🤣😂
Don’t worry guys, you gonna be back .. to the league one 😂😂😂
Bring back Chris … 😢
Slav needs to have a good rethink - a lot of these players have the heart of a pea, too old or are just NGE.  Get Freeman, Bogle, Norrington-Davies and Jebbison in the team and go back to a back three.  The teams Slav are sending out are painful to watch.    Blood the youngsters in like Brunt and Gordon as the season progresses - no way this rabble are finishing top 6.      Bin Sander off.  Doesn't want to be here and looks like he's playing for a move.
united need to get off their fecking knees and start putting some pride and passion back into job they are paid well to do.
Well atleast when we loose dont have to listen to wilder excuses cus u can't  understand a word told jokanovic says mumble foreign  mumble something do better blah blah blah lol
tf has happened to sheffield united 😭
Desperate last night.. can't think of a single positive apart from when the ref blew the final whistle. .
Dog. And. Duck
We are shit
Set pieces 😬
That’s what happens when we loose a decent keeper… but 3 games in league with a out a goal is bad. ⚪️🔴⚔️
Praying wilder gets a new job and takes 6/7 of these muppets
This new manager can't have that many games to change things. If he can't he needs to be moved on ASAP. Bring back Warnock!
Hmmmmm this looks familiar.  It's not the manager(s) fault - it's the players and their complete lack of EVERYTHING.  The only team in the league without a goal after 3 matches.  Tells you everything you need to know.  Optimistic or realistic?  It's only going to get worse.  Honestly, I was watching the game live and it was almost as if half of them just couldn't be bothered.
Sheffied Utd look in trouble, they will do well to avoid a relegation battle again this season.
Balls into the box… think we need to work on that?
The fact yous swapped Burke for robbo is class 😂😂😂
West Brom fully deserved this victory, we looked frightened and didn't look up for a battle, Jokanovic has a problem on his hands co.'s his players dont look to be buying into his way of playing or they dont want to play for him, hardly won a second ball and at least an attempt to do so, Flecks a left sided player and he was on the right! I'm dismayed has to what this is all about, hardly any effort at all, and McGoldrick's miss was criminal, but to be fair we didn't deserve anything from this game.
Guy in the crowd with a towel for long throws shouldn't be allowed
mcburnie = 🐐
How bad is it now that there are no championship highlights on sky sports . I support liverpool but its nice to watch a good championship game now and again
Thought i was watching arsenal concede those long throwins .
Down to league one you go.
Birmingham versus WBA should be an interesting game.
Verrips’s performance was the worst I have seen since Karius during UCL final
highlight of the evening at 4-0 down singing “we’ve had a shot, we’ve had a shot, how shit must you be, we’ve had a shot”… disgraceful performance
Absolute 5hite, disgraceful display, Why not play Veripps ? because he is the worst keeper we have had since John Hope in the 70s. The lot of them shoud give a weks wages tothe Childrens hospital appeal .
Ollie  Burke  still stealing a wage as a footballer
This is fucking disgusting
Why did they all  miss that offside 4th goal?
Jokanovic ain’t going to sort this out tactical chaos just a carry on from Birmingham game under wilder we use to press now we are depressed worst game plan since Adkins 3 more games like this and no points he will be sacked tonight’s team sheet spelt disaster Norwood fleck berge beign overrun Burke lacks a football brain freeman must start over him with mcburnie and Brewster down the middle verbals a goalie do me a favour just flapping at crosses
Norwood hasn’t made a decent pass since 2019 , but he starts every game and the players still let him try and dictate our play , he’s shit and shouldn’t play again
Utter dog shit.
I'm a west brom fan.. can we play you every week?? 😂👍 easy 3 points.
Robinson is not a left back sort midfield out utter disgrace and for God's sake get some fresh blood in
As much as it’s nice to see this as a owl , it’s also so surprising and shocking to see how you’ve started the season. 2 years ago I was watching you thinking these guys are cruising in the prem you was playing such great footy it’s crazy how quick some things change. Same goes for us. Last few seasons we’ve dogshit so I know how a lot of you are feeling. I’m sure you’ll battle out of it though there are plenty of worse teams in the league your just hitting a rough patch atm.
Big changes are needed.we are a shit show right now.
Embarrassing !! No one deserved the shirt last night get the youngsters starting !
I STG Do NOT make an extended highlights of this. Ffs
Up the Baggies 💙🤍💙🤍
UTD O, SAME  OLD SAME OLD.
Don't think we need the highlights tbh the last 3 of our games been shown on TV as been embarrassing enough for us with out seeing it on YouTube aswell 😶
Up the fucking Baggies
I'm Available for your next game if you need a keeper because I could do a better job than that. Shocking
verrips is definately not good enough. strikers cant hit a barn door and midfield cant create.
Old mates throw ins are more overpowered than Model 1887 Akimbo used to be in MW2
2 seasons ago you were acting like you were Real Madrid
Disgusting performance GET BETTER PLAYERS IN
I don’t know who that West Brom player who does throw ins but he was very effective with his opportunities
Damn that throw in is terrifying.
Hope they stopped at the shop on way home bought a bus load of beer and got shit faced.  Team needs to become 1
Bring on the championship, they said.   It'll be fun, they said...
BOING BOING
Why tf is hex sponsored on the billboard. Its literally a crypto scam.
Verrips is shit
should have been 7-0
Pathetic
League 1 inbound 💀
bruh verrips
You guys suck
What a disgrace
🙌♥️♥️♥️♥️
