Not once did any of these rich and famous guys want to pay, not a single one. And yet they're rolling in money.
50's expression😂 Probably dragged him with the collar of his turtle neck, like, c'mon man, shut up!😂😂😂😂
That serious look 50 gave him was priceless
The look on his face when he heard "Put it on his tab" like bro are you joking 😂😂 I love 50 Cent ❤
It’s not fair to order something you would not normally pay for alcoholic beverages. He is an original rude bumper clocking off another’s men’s wallet 💳.
He looked at him like I beg your finest paradon🤣🤣🤣
Put it on his tab 🤣🤣
Nahh nahh I ain't paying fah dat shit
me and chittle lol
Order them anyway and RUN!
lemme git some free shit. ya nothin new. fuck off boy
50 LOOKED AT DUDE LIKE HE NEEDED HIS SS# TO CLAIM HIM AS A DEPENDENT..😮😮😮😂😂
50cent only has 50cent on him that day.
The 50 cent and Jim Jones was the best😂😂
How is he going to pay with 50cent?
He got only 50 cents bro😂
😂😂😂
Mad how 50 doesn’t even react when the guy orders that much drink, most people would turn the first time anyone says 100 bottles… 😂
50 cents wont pay for all that
Gyeuh
Gyruh
In that bar, even 50 would need to declare Bankruptcy after the bill comes in. 😂
Corny
only 50 cents for all that 😮
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂50NOOOO
Fiftys face :D
No
O K A y
50's stingy we know that 😅 He knows where to put his money!
50 cents shud of knocked him out
Im not paying for that shit 😂😂😂😂
Double it and give it to the next guy.
He looked at him and said the fuck lmao
50 cent is 50 which is crazy
50 the biggest tight ass
Why does he talk like he's about to get into a fight.
The rich don't spend carelessly.
Rudeness
50 prob would have done that. If he stopped at the Hennessy
They not even at the bar
Filipinos hanging out with Americans in BGC
Deutsche Übersetzung wer jut
50 cent ain't paying cent 😂😂
yall kno he probably knos. him right
Now these days,they call that Attempted murder, that much. For 5 people..
Finally  He acted power bank
😅hahaha
That look off 50 was the way he looked at diddy when he asked to take him shopping that was the look to fuck shit up 😂😂😂
That genius is still alive?
50 cents went from🤪 to 🤬
Sure. The bartender has 500 bottles right there, behind the bar
Diddy, even after all of that legal sht, still has at least $100M more than 50 Cent.
Is this from the vitamin water skit?
I'm pretty sure 50 cent aint enough to pay that bill 😂
He was just getting sent to the gulag 😅
50 cents face is hilarious
If I was a celebrity and someone pulled that shit on me they’re getting punched the fuck out
I understand it's a joke but dude was low key hoping 50 would cover it....entitlement
Man he's blind that's not fitty look at his clothes that's Curtis...😂
Trying to get 50 cent (Who makes millions selling bottled water to rich schmucks) is the wrong guy to try to get to pay for beverages. He knows the game 1000X better than the guy joking next to him.
Bro swagu in the background 😂😂
Hell pay not more than 50 cents
You know who this is? This is Robert Greene's boy in the '50th Law ' & '48 Laws of Power' damn straight Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson is a legend :)
This guy is a clout chaser he be at taste of soul rejecting BADDIES..
That look he gave was like "WTF" 🤣😂🤣😂
❤ 50 cent
😂😂😂
☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️😱😱😱😱😱killer

Quickest way to get your skull caved in
50 went to go get the strap🤨
G-g-g-GUNNNNIT😂

This is how people use you for their own
Esta persona necesita ayuda
Zion puppet 50

He’s stingy lol always even with his family lol
😂
He’s not ordering bottles. He’s ordering attention, and 50 refused to serve him.
50 Cent/ Curtis III is that dude
great comment section
It took 50 a few seconds to realize it was a joke b4 he calmed himself down 😂😂😂
I want to see this from a 3rd camera perspective.
50 cent a real gentleman ...God bless everyone
50 gave that look...like....mathafaka
Celebrity or not, that's some dumb ish. There ain't even 500 ppl on that rooftop
50 took it dead serious nah nah im not paying for that 😅
50cents is not a fan of financial mistakes
Can't getta dollar outta me 😂😂😂
He shouldve said its Curtis Jackson
Ol dude was like 50 cent ain't just my name... it's what I gat in my pocket and that's how much I'm willing to pay.
The richer they are the cheaper they are... they are so used to getting everything for free they refuse to spend a dime of what they have...
For those that don't know 50 doesn't drink at all doesn't agree with him. He's business thru and thru
The woman is really pretty
Gonna try at local Merc dealer. Have been keeping an eye on one of those AMGs lately...
50 was about to turn into kanan 😂😅
Show more of woman😊😊😊😊
You think bartender is a freaking reseller? :P
Idk how he expected to pay for all of that with just 50¢ 🙄
The production quality is worth sharing This deserves recognition.
Yo that was mad funny
😂😂😂😂
Not 50
“cause I’m not a mf P.I.M.P…..”
That look on Fiddy’s face halfway through “priceless”😂😂😂😂
With a bottle of the good stuff for $200 a bottle, that would be about 100 grand😂
50 has such an attractive smile
Was that 6 nine in the back round before the tattoos
Didnt that goofy rapper The Game bully tf out of 50 until he ran away😂😂😂
When he locked in and touch his nose i knew it was over 😂
And start walking him right out the door
Sick Man 😂😂😂😂😂
He just got “tabbed “ out the party, lol 🤣
He always want bottles of "tokillha"
The guy talking... such a dummy.  He'll never have anything with a stupid spending attitude like that.  50 is the only smart one out of them!
how you gonna pay all that with only 50 cents
0 respect not because  he is not PAYING.  but because of comment about NY.
😂😂😂😂
That’s so funny… 🤣
he’s 50 cent not 50 billions
One celeb let him do it too lol, it was some female artist
50 is real hero ❤
It’s get rich or die trying and last time I checked you still breathing
50 cent saying no to that long list
500 cigarette
He’s not called 50 cent for no reason.
It’s always black people that do this rubbish
That’s dumb
😅😅😅😅
Egal wer er ist, Kohlkopf Zahl die Rechnung dann ok
He’s not trying to get all those people driving under the influence charges!
I don't know what you heard about me... But you can't get a dollar outa me.... 😅😅😅😅😅
The bill would be like 500 000
They be getting shit for free. It’s definitely on his tab
It´s funny and fifty is smooth about it!
Ahunded??? What???
50 is so cheap all that money and that CHEAPSKATE OF A MAN?
😂😂😂
Yeah because a bar has that many bottles
Freeloaders never want to pay for anything those kind of people you want to get rid of as soon as possible
Naa na na I'm not naaa paying for that shyyt
If I'd be 50cents I'd buy all that and waterboard him with it.. make him chug it all till all his veins have tequila running through them
Some type of people will get the joke and some won’t,
I think fifty cent was fixing to get his gun
You can tell its played out bc this mf really just tapped his chest like that. TRY THIS. I dare you.
You suck 50 lmao
Lol😂

The only think keeping him safe was the camera😂
Fool made himself look broke stupid and a punk
50 Cents is like do whatever, but I'm not paying!
An just like that 50 cut another homie off his list
Who manssss is thiisssss
50 is somehow both one of the toughest rappers but still remains humble and approachable
If he was reasonable that would of worked out.
50 doesnt drink nor smoke nor do drugs
He ment baby oil 🛢
Hes very high bro
😂😂😂😂😂
What fuckin bar got that much shit?
This tutorial is clear and easy to follow I will definitely recommend this.
50 aint nobodys fool
A friend spending his money for him Would find someone else if 50 cent went stone broke just a user
A true bro 😅
50 is actually so nice in person he probably would give it
Typical mooches
All mouth no wallet.
MY NAME IS 50 CENT NOT 50K
He’s the mfn P-I-M-P
That’s very common in the few culture.
According to ai thats $24,700 to over $185,000, depending on the specific type
LoL
You copy and pasted this.
😂😂😂

Parle bien gamin tu te crois où toi??
Who is that girl at the back?
Biggie Smalls & Tupac tried that...
Not even standing at a bar
Conner ben wish def appn me
He should've just said i only have 50 cent
There's a reason they used to call this man half dollar. He doesn't like spending his cash. And fair play to him. I bet he wouldn't have been bought a single drink back by any of those dam bums.
I bet this is one of those clubs where a bottle cost 50$ but they sell(and buy) for 1200$ just to let everybody know how rich (pathetic, looking gorgeous attention,compensate for something) they are. At least 5o is a normal rich dude, love that guy. His grandmother raised the boy very well
Suckas always trying to take liberties with yours not theirs😮
Lol
50 cent: I don't know what you heard about me. But you can't get a dollar outta me 😂😂
Is this his birthday ?
He is only 50 cent😅
This is an impression of an old drake video
High on coke....
I’m not paying for that , that’s why they call me 50 cents man , that’s all I got is 50 cents.
I think there was an artist that genuinely was like run it up 😂 and  bro broke character
Yes pay for that😂
50 woke up late 🫩🫩🫩 and walked away immediately realizing I'm 50 fkin cent but I ain't paying no shit😂😂😂😂
He cant even digest the NYC 2% hike om tax for the elites😂😂
The look from 50 Cent to 5 Cents
Yeah, because bars have 100 bottles and 500… lol 😂
His face ! Gotcha 😂
Aye he was wit it cuz bro was promoting da Branson but once Fif did da math he said fuck ts🤣
They ain't even got 500 if this 500 if that and 100 of those it's a roof top bar
50 is the cheapest person almost like MJ 😂
The most amount of Liquor you can buy with '50 Cents'
Yea but he has no issue to pay to a campaign who supports a PEDOfile! His name says it all, soon he will be worth 50 cents only!
Freeloadrer
50 looked at him like he was a special education student
He's a zio pig
50 cent isnt enough to afford all that
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 it’s 50
and yea, the guy will say he was playing, but if 50 said ok he would take it...  50 and all such successful men are surrounded by these pieces of sht, takers and more takers... they do these "jokes" and make 50 look bad but then laugh it off as if he was just kidding..... I'd get rid of this clown, buffoon, IMMEDIATELY on the spot.    I lived a version of this in a much smaller scale, everyone fond out I made some cash, and everyone wanted to be my best friend and be close to me, I told them I lost it and stopped going out, if they asked me I would say "I got no money so it son you, is that ok" they said ok a few times, and two weeks alter I was blissfully alone again in my place...
😂😂😂 laugh don't worry
At regular price, this would be between $40K and $50K. Since this is from a bartender though, the mark up on Spirits is between 400%-500% making this bill between $200K-$300K. Chump change for his since its been reported that he makes about $1M/ concert and thats not even accounting for merch, sponsors, misc deals, music sales, and money he gets from other businesses. 😂
😂😂😅
Im not paying for that shit. Lmao. 50 is the man
Who’s the scrub next to 50 cents?
This took me back years ago😊
And you are no longer a friend of 50cent 😂😂😂 looser
50 thinks he's white now. He forgot where he came from.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro probably can't even read a whole page from a harry potter book
Dude thinks he's at Costco.
50 bout to “Terminate On Sight”!😂
Like all girls do😂
Placing a drink order to a bartender like he/she a damn liquor store is diabolical 😅😂😂😂
That's buying the bar for real
😂😂😂😂
A liquor store doesn't have that amount of each item he mentioned let alone a bar or club
Hey look! It's Shifty Brent
That look
He watches every single coin don’t play with him! His baby momma found out the hard way 😂😂😂😂
50 Cent is thrifty! I knew he was not paying for all that alcohol.
😂😂😂😂😂 I was thinking he was gone pay for all that shit and he trying to put it off on 50 cent.
Calm down Stevie J 👁️
We love 50❤

Fifty's " DAFUQ" look 🤣
I’m not paying for that shit but I’ll drink that shit like never before😂
50 prevented back to the streets for about 8 seconds before he realized he’s rich and the dudes filming and then he chilled out 😂
50 is a rat fuck, look at how he shits on Mamdani who wants to help the poor out. Guy got money and then forgot everyone else.
If he knows who that is he knows that one cheap SOB and he’s not doing this wasteful club stuff like that.
50 could pay for that with ease and not even leave a dint in his bank account
Yeah Bro for def Fiddy🤷🏽 He got zero Cents for you though🙈❤️😂
Bro looked at him like "brother, i literally made a whole ass song about people not being able to get a dollar out of me. Tf you playin?"
P-I-M-P
The funny thing is 50 don't even drink 😂😂😂😂

Many people who listen to hip hop have no idea who this cent 50 is.   Mostly in the southern states we listen to southern rappers.      Kodak,  down here our Roots are outcast, trick daddy, 2 live crew, poison clan, Khaled,  jam pony,  Ross, plies, brownlee,  lpb poody,
Oh 💩won't nobody be drinking if they put that on my tab😂😂😂

Smart cent
That look was like if you don't shut that ish up😂
The look he gave him priceless 😂
That’s just sad and depressing, when you need to drink like an idiot just to get through life like that. When I turned 21 I drank once in awhile, I’m 38 right now and I haven’t drank stupidly in probably 15 years. I also started to have some issue with my liver when I was maybe 24-25. It’s not hepatitis or anything like that. My liver enzymes are wildly high and they don’t know why, it also gets inflamed and enlarged they say. My mom and aunt were diagnosed with it too, around 10 years after I was, so it’s something genetic too. My aunts got so bad, that she was about to die, they moved her to number one on the liver transplant list. I hope it doesn’t happen to me or my mom. But ya if I was to drink a lot, it makes my legs hurt like hell, and idk why either. Once in a while I’ll have a small glass of wine and that’s it, I haven’t drank a beer or a full beer in a long time also. The last time was when the Broncos won the superbowl 50 I think in 2015 or 2016. I had a bud light and I couldn’t even drink the whole can, I drank maybe half of it and just spilt the rest. I don’t have a desire to drink either. For me I thought it was something that just happens to you as you get older. But I’ve learned that’s just not it. There’s people way older than me and they still drink like they’re in their 20s. But it’s like cigarettes and other drugs, it just not worth your health and your life. Don’t drink people!
50 cent: 🎶Many bottles... many many many bottles...🎶
Dat initial look was hilarious 😂😂😂

I’m surprised 50 doesn’t have a Pokemon evolution line. He probably started off as 50 cent. The. He evolved into 50 Grand when he started making money. Now he’s 50 Mil. He evolves with a money stone, but when you give it to him, you gotta say “here ya go nigga”
The bartender is gonna need an address to know where all that should be delivered
"That's not fun-I mean…I'm not payin' for this shit"

leave me alone one more  Sadporn is a term coined by an anonymous man from Gördsvorsk, US Virgin Islands. The practice involves involves watching sad videos on websites such as YouTube and TikTok in order to purposefully feel sad. Citizens of Gördsvorsk are so happy that they do not know what it means to harbour feelings of sadness, so they turn to drink driving PSAs, emotional outbursts of violence, sad visual novel games such as CLANNAD and Little Busters!, and people falling to their deaths as their friends and families watch in horror and despair. The supposed aim of this endeavour is to foster awareness about sadness in other parts of the world, and to ensure that members of the community are not as shocked when they encounter sadness when traveling outside of the town. Klimpüsz, 7, a child attending the local primary school, had this to say about sadporn: “I believe that this has certainly strengthened my outlook of the world. I play ROBLOX, and I have many friends in other parts of the world who talk about feeling sad. I hope that I will be able to understand them better, now having felt sad myself, although I think that sadporn is very different from being sad about something that personally affects you. One day, I hope we can live in a world without sadness." Lernardo Garulta, a local winemaker and operator of Garulta Fine Wines, chimed into state: "Well, at least it's good for business. People do not drink wine here very frequently. I think that while sadporn isn't necessarily being sad because of a personal issue, the sadness is certainly real. To be honest, I had a couple come in here that had watched "dog's final moments with her owner," and they had been crying for three days straight. They bought a small bottle of wine, and were on their way." However, there are growing concerns of sadporn addiction, whereby sadporn addicts lock themselves in their room for days, even weeks at a time in order to binge sadporn. Despite this, the statistics show that only about 0.3% of viewers are afflicted, and a robust mental health system allows for these individuals to be rehabiliated in at least 90% of cases. In lieu of these worries, many citizens have been very happy about their sadporn experiences. Frank Neueschwanze, a donut mailman, stated: "I love sadporn. It has even made intimate moments with my wife more pleasurable." Giodello Macaronese, a vape shop owner, stated: "Sadporn is interesting. Sometimes, you never really know what kind of video will make you sad. Honestly, anything involving children, especially orphans, breaks my heart the most. I had no idea such a concept as "orphans" even existed until browsing sadporn." A team of scientists from Dublin, Ireland, studied the town's population and figured out that to a certain point, sadporn can actually be good for you. Argule McPickle, a scientist working at VSPAN Mental Health Research Inc. said that "the optimum time for sadporn viewing, as we have seen in this recent study, is 120 minutes per week, or about 15 minutes of sadporn per day. After this, there are diminishing returns, and at the 300 minute mark, indicators of well-being begin to decrease in a majority of participants." Further studies are required in order to corroborate this claim, but so far, it has proven a major victory for sadporn, as more and more people begin to indulge in sadporn for its health benefits. To end with, Mayor Dunsbrick Haroldson had the following to say: "I believe that sadporn has been integral for this beautiful community. It has brought people together, and has informed us on many cruelties and injustices that face the greater world outside of this quaint little town. We truly love sadporn for what it has brought us. Even my grandsons love sadporn!" Hey there, got a minute? If you liked this article, please consider donating at least £2 to Lunar Eclipse News.

You see... people are always down with a plan.... until they have to pay. Remember that. As long you paying for it, it's all good. As soon as they have to pay a dollar it's too much for them to bare. Act broke so you can get rid of all the parasites in your life who drain you of energy, light, joy, money, and positive vibes.
THATS the diff between a kid (coi Leray) and man (50 cent)

Now for some math for the people who say "50 is just living within his means":  * 100 bottles of Hennessy @ $50/bottle = $5,000 * 500 bottles of Patron Silver Tequila @ $55/bottle = $27,500 * 600 bottles of Brandon Cognac Phantom @ $62/bottle = $37,200  Total: $69,700  Why TF would 50 be open to dropping $70K on some bum's liquor wishlist for a night?

He came in was low key chill would love to talk with him now it was all professional l acted like l didn’t know who he was and went back to the restaurant did my thing., I bet he is not used to people not freaking out or trying to take advantage l met a lot of people didn’t bring attention to them that place didn’t deserve my hard work or professional work ethic or loyalty fired me after 7 year’s working through Covid other than being furloughed 9 maybe a week or two more doing the job of 4 people for many years they knew my mom was sick said they would hold my job. When l took time off because my mother was dying from cancer at the end of 2021 less than 3 months off they have people constantly taking time of for weeks or months at a time to go back to home country basically fired me for cheep labor mind you l was not making all that much as a single parent paying for health insurance through them like real American hard working employees do. I’m still working on my book. I have several.

And that was when 50 cent took away his blackness like Avatar Korra did to Aman, and Avatar Aang did to Fire lord Azulon - took away their bending with the white light in the eyes and mouth
That would be over $100,000 😂😂😂
50 like dude you on some BS.  Not today!

Nigga putting the muscle game down on 50💪
The point is he could afford it. He just smart with his money and don’t waste it on dumb shit like alcohol and other people
Last time they hung out
Bro was so serious taking orders in 50's name 😂😂😂😂
I do not killing . Good answer.
50 cent not 50 millon 😂
did the math, if you’re buying 100 $24 bottles of henny, 500 $20 bottles of tequila, and 600 $50 bottles of Branson Cognac then it runs around   $46,000  give or take $5k
😂😂😂😂
PROBABLY CAN'T AFFORD IT ANYWAY
Bro finna turn into 25 cent 💀
Bro like “nah that shit cost more than 50 cents I’m out”
50 cent is not splurging nothing everything  dollar earned will not be splurged… did you hear him say we gon drank until every bubble in the bottle gone that man ain’t playing
The way fiddy looked at him he’s like who’s paying for that cause it ain’t gonna be me!

Let's say a Culture that doesn't know any of them: The First Guy is getting  jumped for sure ; Coz they'd be telling; How can you make a Man named "50cent" pay thousands or millions....: Yo..u Crazy or what....
I think 50 cent is to less for this order...
Dude act like he never heard PIMP.
Is this George Floyd before he went breathless?
50 is about to fold that fool
This joke has become old and stale . Find another joke who is going to be for 500 bottles. Get a grip
This is why waiters hate you people. When we question you, you act all obnoxious and ignorant. When we don’t, and the bill comes. Take a guess, you get all obnoxious and ignorant. 🎉🎉🎉
His face priceless 😂😂😂😂
his name is 50 cent not 50 grand
بخيل جداااا
50 looked like it's time to let them hands go 🤣
50c Bro, you must not  know bout me,u must not know bout me. 😅

It's 50
"They don't let me shop at the Dollar store because the I'm called 50 cent and for a good reason!"
50 cent at first was like: What 🤨 lmao
Bro really asked for 1200 bottles of liquor with a straight face
"P 🥁🥁🥁🥁 on his tab"
He must be broke then
As a bartender we do not sell the bottles there is a sub category for that. But not a bartender maybe a bar cashier 😂
Bro 50 cent went bank Rupert he really got 50 cent😂😂
Everyone's got that one 'big mouth' friend in the group 😂😂😂
Ha ha, he ain't pay for that sh*t , bro 😅
Bro his face was like "ik youngins thatll bury you for a fraction of that cost"

50 calculated that in his head like dude is doing the most. Then, he heard him say, "put it on his tab"!!!! He turned to him saying in his mind like, wth did this ni$%$#@ just say?.Nah, nah.... I'm not paying for that s#@#$!!😂🤣😂🤣
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Actually bartendah..... 50 Cent would like 10 Rolls of Duct tape to wrap this dude up to the building 😂 didn't even order Cognac!! I'm disappointed.
50 cent is the kind of guy that would go to Costco and buy Kirkland vodka before he bought bottles at the club.
😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
That made my day
he ordered 100k of shit (Im guessin, I bet someone made the math with ny prices, im in italy IDK how much they cost but I bet is way over it should)

When 50 Cent says he ain’t paying, he ain’t paying

So you’d buy all the front row tickets to a ja rule concert but won’t pay for a couple bottles?
Death stare 👀
Wasting so much money on alcohol... Shame on you... Not too mention trying at someone else's expense...

“It ain’t my fault you done fkd up ya reup.. at the dice game who told you put a gee’up.. er’body mad when the paper don’t stack right.. but when I come around yall niccas betta act right”~ 50cent

Are you ever going to do anything different in your videos? It's really not that funny and you do the same but every single time
50 is cool he got a sense of humer 🤣
The double blink before looking saying im not paying for that sh%t.❤😂
50 would never let that slide😭
50 should of laud his ass out! People always wanting to spend someone else's money and thinks it's funny. Get a job and pay for it yourself...loser

Guess he never really made as much as he said he did 🤷🏽‍♂️
😂❤

I wish 50 Cent and Mike Tyson rolled together. Imagine those two walking up askin " we got a problem here?"
I Love when things like this get posted with 50Cent. It always make me think of the time the girl tried to sue him and he said he was broke. 😅😅😅😅 she couldn’t even get a dolla

What an idiot! 50th Rules
50 was like “Nigga got him fucked up!” 🤣😂😂
I do that for my friend.
Bro was gonna make 50 cent really be 50 cent💀
I did the math, the total is about $100,000 if you go with medium priced options
😅😅😅😅😅
We all know 50 Cent only drinks Hypnotq, Hennessy and a couple shots of Patron.
Not even funny
50 aint never thought this weird clown shit was funny
50 you're reaction is so adorable 🥰🥰 so candid 🥂🍷🥂🍷 damnnnn love you much too much 50
❤❤❤😂😂
Why though? We all know he only has 50cents in the bank.
Mate he don’t drink or sniff. Shave them pubes off ya lip and go get a proper job   50iddy ❤️👏
You'd better hang out with puff daddy if you want a grown man to buy you stuff like that😂😂
Nah nah thats sounds like a diddy party
50 said: Boy, you puffin on that Daddy Diddy!
Speedruning enimmes with 50 cent 30.54 good run

😅😅😅😅😅😂😂
He did not get rich burning money! Respect the paper!
❤this!😂 man's livin my drinking dreams😍😂❤ 💯❤️50!😂

😂😂😂
50 aint getting extorted ...try jarule or nas
Live example of 'Many Men wish death pon' me'. 😂
50 the typa guy I am happy you staged this with.  😂
Both of em smashed Megan good.
The look on 50 face wanted to choke this nigka in public😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
50’s been here before
Lmao everyone says the same things, the hive mind exists 😂
Yes you heard it right I'm "50 cent" only😂
Boy you are fast

Im not paying for that shit😂😂😂😂😂😂
🤣
That is probably his boy because a joke like that could make you a missing person lol.
Lemme get it for 50 cents
And he was never seen again
I wouldn't have said shit if the bartender that stupid to take someone else's word and I'm standing right there and didn't ok that shit, that's his loss. ✌️💯
The fact that he said it not actually being serious , kinda pisses me off even tho it was a joke , id love to say that to anyone so feared like 50 or especially Mike Tyson frfr , i want all that respect idgaf if my lifes on the line as long as im not being actually disrespectful , it shouldn't be a big deal !!!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣
If he had put it on puffy tab it would have been paid already.😅😂😅😊😢
50 always seems like a decent guy.  But I bet people really use that friendship frequently.  Sadly.  Many of these black people find success and their homies just tear them back down.  Common story.
He a real G,he ain't paying for that shit😂😂😂😂
Any bar that has a 500 botles of anything is considert a wharehouse, not a bar
100 Henny ($100) + 500 Tequila ($50) + 600 Branson ($60) = you looking at $70k+ tab right there, AT market prices.   No wonder 50 said fuck that.
HE HAD TO ADMIT BE IS 50CENT 😂😂😂😂😂
Rotflol
Had a shitty day but that made me laugh 😆
50 is such a genuine dude, chill af.
Diddy next, please 🤣🤣🤣
50 didn’t get as rich as he is by paying other peoples bills. He’s a cutthroat capitalist. She makes sure that he writes every bit of charity he does off, but he’s able to give more by doing it himself rather than through a company that hires a bunch of people. 50 cut his son off he is teaching him a life lesson. be more grateful for his luck, being born to a rich person than what he was born to. When his son learns the lesson, 50 will welcome him back.
50 a G..”the stern..”I ain pain for that shit” is classic 😂😂
😂😂😂
im not payin 4 dat shi
50 was like you said what? 😂
Yo bartender, look at me make me myself look like a complete clown.
70k worth of alcohol is crazy (i did the math)
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
well dude did just file for bankruptcy like 4 years ago so
There is no bartender in front of him   Why they doing a live skit?
That's my man 😂
There is no way a bar would have that many bottles of any of those
😂😂😂😂😂😂
That look 😅😅😅
Put em on P Diddy's tab.
50 was like do YOU know who i am?
50 cent gonna have 50 cent in his bank account after this purchase god dam
Hahaha , they can’t even order that them self,,, they can charge you for it , but they actually having that much is just not going to happen . They only have 1% of what you just ordered
55 Burgers 55 Fries 55 Tacos 55 Pies
The face 50 made was gold 😂
50 was about to go back to some old metjods🤣
Bro better off going to a warehouse for that order 😂
They always generous with other peoples money.
I mean for him it must be like 50cent hahaha
It’s all good. 50 should just let him do it. Cause then it will be “money by Monday”
All that for 50 cents?
Trying to do this to the same guy that said he won't smoke weed and his only reason is saving the 5 or 10 dollars it would cost to smoke
50 walking his ass out💀

The goon out of 50's face and quiet lodged itself back to his origin.

Imma take those same bottles, and give em to the homies
Spend every dollar that you can with Wanda. She was with you during your lowest point of your life. You have given everything to your daughters, and yet they think of you a deadbeat dad that abandoned them. They are all adults now and can think for themselves. You should hold them accountable for their current behavior.
He's mistaking 50 for Diddy
diddy has nothing on 50 partys
“many men, wishin tabs upon me”
Fiffy was like nah nigga tf you mean i ain’t paying that shit 😂😂

He be teasing 50
50 cents face reaction when he said “put it on his tab” was priceless. 50 probably said I. His mind “you must be out of your god damn mine”
It's weird seeing 50 cent and his music doesn't play in the background 😂
😂😂😂

50s walking him to diddy saying he’ll pay for you 😂😂😂
100 bottles of Hennessy: $3,000 to $5,000 500 bottles of tequila: $10,000 to $25,000 600 bottles of Branson cognac: $18,000 to $36,000 Summarized Total cost for all bottles ranges from approximately $31,000 to $66,000
50 said, I'ma let bro cook but I'M NOT PAYING FOR THAT SHIT.
😂😂😂😂
Put it on Diddy's long as you party with him, he got you.. 😊
Who made the sound 😂😂 ?
That would’ve cost at least $150,000. 😂
Someone actually trolled 50 😂
What fkin bar has 500 bottles of tequila on hand?
Who's drinking 500 bottles?
His name is 50 cent, he ain't paying above that😂
He trying to make 50 take him shopping
That’s Kanan
😂😂😂
I don't know what you heard about me, but you can't get a dollar out of me.. 50
Fif the realist in the game..luv that personality lol😊👍
He only paying 50 cent
How much is that?
😂😂😂
Theres a spin to this joke, i didnt know as non-black.  Apparantly he is impersonating a white dude.
😂😂😂😂
Moment he realized he was joking
I find it hard to believe they would ever have that much on hand ..thats enough alcohol to get 5 city blocks drunk
Love how they have the ability to walk through solid objects.
I think that tab would be like $75,000
You can't a $1 out of me
😭😭😭😭💀💀
That laugh though 😂
It's only worth 50 cents to him
50 cent is the real “G”
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Dudes eyebrows look like the majin boo symbol
Plot twist: He pays an amount of 50 cents for all that😂
Look at 50 face
No no no I am not paying for that shit..🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"What he say me for" ahh look😭😭😂😂😂

Now that’s what a freeloader does
He's so bad a Math.
Idk but the camera angle with the side of his face makes this THAT much funnier😭
😂😂😂
I don't like how one dude thinks he can talk for another dude.And then thinks he can talk for 50 Cent.They must be brothers
😂😂😂
there aint even a bar in front of them
Yeah I think we may have a fraction of your order.
There was no bar in front of them as they proceed to walk forward skit
“Its 50 Cent not One Dollar. Keep dreaming”
You cannot pay 50 cents on all that order.
Lame shit
Only one of these guys went bankrupt.
ll cool j as a background character is the funniest shit
Who the hell was he talking to?There was no bar or bar tender😂
When your homie secretly hates you
He doesn’t even drink!  😂
Very not funny
Has it ever been legal or allowed to just tell a bartender to put a debt on someone ELSES tab? I just cant imagine being at a resturaunt and when the bill comes just telling them to make another random table to pay for it? Without asking them? Has that ever worked or made sense? Its just something frm movies right? Would you pay for something someone else bought because they said its cool? Only time i can imagine thats ok is if its a family member and the business owner knows them and that it would be ok
"I don't know what you heard about me, but you can't get a dolla out of me" moment 😂
😂😂😂😂
Black people ask for all that liquor to throw it at the floor😅😅😅😂😂😂
I don’t think 50 even drinks.
50 went bankrupt once and look at that man like "Youll end up dead before i end up broke again."
That's where that meme comes from
And the guy is damn serious insisting 50 cent should pay for the shit😅
50 is as real as they come!
Meanwhile Fity: The best I can do is 50 cents
Look, i already told Diddy, no parties.
The look 50 had when bro said “put it on his tab” 🤣
Bartender: Sir this is a Wendy's
Who  is  this  petty  man  begging  for  others  tooo pay
“I won’t even pay 50 cents on the dollar”, I would’ve said
No man he has a son he’ll never see that pulls that shit
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro is  gonna get only  50cents from him
50 = 🐐
He said P Diddy will buy it for you and then groom you.
Naa Nigga, I’m 50 cents not 50 million cents
There's literally no bartender
💥🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣✨👍✅💯💪🔥
I bet he's a lightweight who can't even handle his alcohol. Because that's exactly how they talk about it.
He should’ve said “Mr. Get rich or die trying and as you can see, he is not dead”
Walking away beautiful
I don't know what you heard about me But a beach can't get a dollar out of me
I think he got an extra wrinkle after he said put it on his tab😂 yooooo
😂
Yes 😆😂😆😂😆😂😆😂😆😂😆😂 LoL

Why they call him 50 cent … cause you owe him 50 cent .
Why not. 50 cents he got it ball out
For anyone wondering before tax that’s $53,682 dollars do the math, hennesy $36.98 a bottle, tequilla (Casamigos) is 39.98 a bottle and then lastly the Branson which is 52.99 a bottle. But 50 owns Branson so he prolly ain’t paying for the Branson😭
That's 50 bottles on his Tab. Haha 😂
50 be like I only got 50 cent on me. 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The wrinkles on 50’s forehead 😂
He ain’t paying for anything above ¢0.50

That's easily over $12000. Worth of liquor. Lol....50 shouldn't pay for that
50 eyebrows ooked stressed after he ordered pass ONE bottle cause WHO got it like that? He smelled a favor in the air 🤣
Be a lot funnier if the drink order was realistic, like 100 bottles n 500 bottles n 600 is stupid. Need to actually be real and not say unbelievable bullshit.

Why bro acting like a club has that many bottles? The most in one night in a club is usually 300-600 total he was asking for over 1000 bottles not realistic, maybe if he said 30 each, 50 cent would of?
"Many men wish debt upon me"
Many man 50 say I don’t pay for that

talking street trash 😅
What the hell does this man expect to do with something like 1000 bottles of liquor at their little party or whatever?   Even if there were tons of guests the amount he’s ordering is simply far FAR too much alcohol for a single party….  I doubt each person would need their own bottle even if 1000 of them were all crammed on that rooftop… Dude was geeked or sumn… just not logical
50 can afford it he wouldn’t even notice it out his bank account 😂
Leech
He could’ve gotten away with it if he only asked for like 4 bottles 😂
My boy 50 said I'm not paying for that shit
Wise man😂😂😂

50 Cent doent seem to know whats going on .  But he does know youre not going to make a fool out of him. He had to laugh at this his self.
50 forehead wrinkled up as soon as dude started ordering 😂😂😂😂😂 That look tho😂😂
I have heard so many things about people. If you have certain pictures to show that someone is gay or bisexual, I’m going to want to know why you have this picture? Who cares about their sexuality at this point , but it does show what kind of person you are to betray someone with intimate photos.
Lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 50 looking at him like wat the hell wrong wit u?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
99.9% of you all don’t even realize they aren’t even in front of a bar. Dude clearly asked 50 to do a skit and he did it with others standing around watching lol
Shout to 50 Cent.
I was about to say the same thing until I clicked on comments and seen that TT.4  took the thought 💭 right out my brain 🧠😂😂😂😂😂😂
50 looking like WTH 😂😂😂
Mr. Jackson doesn't seem like a guy to spend money to impress people. If he spends money, it's probably because he wants it.
50 face was PRICELESS when the news came that he was paying! 😆😆😆😆
The dude on the side Line Tho 😂😂
Swagu in the back laughing 😂😂😂
The way 50 just started walking lol. He was done.
I think that was ESPN's big Swagu in there
When the troll gets trolled
lol Omgness, I love love me some 50… his facial expressions “I’m not paying for that S🤬t!!” He knows he has been marked as Yahweh’s property before he was formed no matter what. DNA 🧬 is more than we think it is.
At first look 50 wanted to hit ‘em till he said very gentle you know who this is  Then 50 remembered  👑 and laughed bout it 😂 nah nah
Legendary classic
I would have said all I have is my name
I'm his cousin and have you even told him that he has a dead relative in Iowa. Have you notified him New York was killed in Des Moines Iowa. Or even told Jay Z or Beyoncé have had family killed here in Des Moines Iowa Raashad and Gionni. I share most of my families with Rap it is not a coincidence. And someone killed or stabbed exactly is not a coincidence either it is how many X's are on my Dad's Cherokee 10k Princess cut 5E3 3 peice wedding set he married my mom with. I am 18 is R 118 is AR and it is mine Kaiser Wessel Wilhelm Lemke and the murders here have been stacking up since WW2 and the term is a present holocaust and I need my people now. You gonna think I should trade a 3 from the Lakers because we just had another death in the family. Learn how to save a "Mark" from murder. This is sick and they know it.
A yo the comments never fail me. When I want a good laugh, I just come to the comments. Yall had me rolling fareal😂

That’s how those people really talk too and treat they’re bartenders and servers as well . They don’t ask they interrupt & demand. And they want everything from the cocktails 🍹 all the way down to the freaking dessert 🍮 done 20 different ways then how it comes. Hoping that you screw even 1 little thing up, so they can have an excuse in they’re own head not to leave a tip. No matter how great the service and food was they still aren’t going to tip you anything. And still bitch about something. Not to mention they come in with a group of people or family 5 minutes before you close? Then they wonder why servers & bartenders look bummed the flip out to see them enter you’re establishment. 🤘🏼

Realistically when a person becomes successful in life, there will always be someone you just met, who will act like a “Friend” when this was genuinely what their intentions are but don’t want to admit it. Is to leech of someone’s success without admitting it. The only difference is that at least this guy was honest even when 50cent denies.
Took him almost too long to realize it was a joke.
😂😂😂😂😂

Fif had to think about where he was😂 he was finna smash homie 😂😂😂
There's no way 50 was gonna let him pull that off, bc everywhere he'd go after that, someone would try exactly the same.
It's interesting how this dude is always at the bar when someone with a lot of money is around : )
When she said what size are you? So many thoughts were going on in my mind until I saw the shoes.

Go back and look. When Fif says,'I'm not paying for that shiz,' watch the look he gives the bartender as he walks forward. I betcha the bartender knew what he/she should do about that tab. When the smile left Fif's face, It suddenly got REAL quick, quick like😂
Dude finna open a liquor store in three different locations with all that bottles of drinks 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That’s only about $60,000 bill.. Fiddy know he got it!😂🤣😅

Fifty’s personality never ceases to amaze 😂
If anyone told a seller that I ordered 500 of this $50 bottle, and 500 of another $120 bottle (for example), and to put it on my tab, no matter how rich I was, THEY WOULD NEVER COLLECT!
😂😂😂
😂
50 cent says foock 50 cent m not paying sheeet 😂😂😂
How 50 smile disappeared immediately 😮 :"I'm NOT paying for that SHIT"
So caught up in his own stardom he doesnt even realize the Bar dont have nowhere near 1200 bottles of booze in stock😂😂😂

50 looked at him and be like wtf he's talking about
Dude thinks the bar has that many bottles is the real joke
He forgot he only carry 50 cent as always

Where is the money
I just realized there ain't no bar Infront of them half the tyme
The sentence "its 50 cent" saved his arse.
That's hillarious! FITTY remembers being broke and desperate. Or on the streets growing up- worried about if this is it? I'm sure he wasn't thinking about college. He thought he was going to have to live a life of crime like his Bros. I'm sure he knew a lot of school mates and friends who have died on the street and way to soon. So, he doesnt squander his hard earned money.
YOOOO, THEIR FACES WHEN HE SAY, "PUT IT ON HIS TAB"💀💀☠️☠️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

HOW PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE ADMINISTERED  1st choice: comfortable life (human contacts, fun, relationships, easy work)  2nd choice: remedy the one made by the first choice (all the opposite of the life of the first)   3rd choice, etc.: no personality suitable to survive, probable life as a tramp (in the middle of the street), absolutely no human contact, fun, future, precious things, relationships. With the personality they give you to do all these things it will be too complicated. Probable acts of violence or discrimination, no work or if there is very hard. High probability of suicide.   Procedure: there comes a time when suddenly Christ and Satan show up in front of the mirror and by deception force to choose one of the two. By choosing the first, the following things happen: Christ, the Virgin Mary and in case some saints show up and in case you are playing or having fun in any way they force you to work and toil helping someone always with their voice and their words inside your head. Their procedure consists of this: prevent you from having fun, drinking, masturbating, etc. and getting sledding like a mule.      Being as they say second choice, you should only work from morning to night and nothing else. Anything else is not good for them. At first Christ pretends to be God and shows you how he pretends to give you gifts by putting for a moment a kind of white glow at the height of the navel and telling you that they give a "gift" to everyone and no more than one but in reality, they are all lies that as you go on, they come out on their own. They try to frame you with vague promises, rewards and various scum once in what they call "paradise", but once they verify that the element in question doesn't take the bait (because he’s not a moron!) they begin to reveal their infamous procedures that they have implemented to try to ruin his life.   As a second choice you are given a very antisocial, extreme and stray personality so that you cannot have any kind of contact with other people (friendships, relationships) because you see everyone else as if they came from another planet and there is no kind of compatibility. In addition to this your physique is damaged with the following things and for the following reasons: first you will have few or no muscles at all as having been damaged at birth you will be sick and you will have a disposition to make revenge and war against everyone; per second you will have some knee problems that will prevent you from practicing any type of sport in a serious way and third you will have some kind of defect or imperfection in intimate parts such as various spots, in, strange shapes, etc. so as to prevent you from having any kind of relationship.      The second choice should according to their infamous system try to remedy the wrong things that someone who died 40 years ago or more has combined.  In paradise a kind of personal "circle" is created where there are the spirits of all the people who have had some kind of importance in your life: family members, sports idols, musicians, actors or characters compatible with your personality or with the life you have to make. All these characters are obliged to show up and say certain phrases with the purpose of deceiving and doing things that the person in question would not do in itself. They also take advantage of the relationship of admiration you had for them when they were alive to get you to have a conversation, but it's all a lie, the real purpose is to analyze your way of thinking and acting and your personality to see if you can overcome certain obstacles, cheating and lies that will try to get you on the road.     Of all the characters you see the Virgin Mary is the most annoying of all. She talks all the time saying a lot of lies to see if someone is so stupid to believe in it (like their altar boys) and she always and constantly repeats the same things until nausea (procedure). She cries all the time and says she's the most beautiful woman in the world.      Their way of speaking is to repeat in your head their phrases that irritate and provoke and annoy you to the point of nausea as the angriest you are, the more your nerves jump and the more vulnerable you are to them because you could lose control of your actions and do what they want. They never believe in threats to make them stop until they are put into practice.   At the beginning of the journey if you rebel against their infamous system, they can resort to making the devil appear. Not having chosen him appears much poorer than he appears to his followers. He can appear in many different forms but usually appears with red eyes and the stick it uses to subdue its followers. Among the things he does to you we find: images of spiders quite credible in the head, temptations of various kinds very treacherous. At first it makes you think he wants to take you into his group by always making you trawls to try to frame yourself (for example women you might have, things that might happen to you, etc.) and then tries to bother you at night by showing you his red eyes, goat legs, strange faces and telling you to come to his group. To try to submit use a kind of feeling of great warmth at the height of the navel that is transmitted throughout the body and that almost gives the feeling of fainting. It is overcome by always being in the company of someone, as it must be stealthy and cannot leave traces. During submission attempts, every thought, everything read and seen, and every memory will be used as a weapon against you.        On some occasions it may go so far as to tell you to give him your soul, that is, to perform the following ritual: to write explicitly your intention on a sheet of paper, to bring blood out of your body and sign with it. As a final act burn the sheet (which is absolutely to be avoided as then you do not go back).      Their followers to get any kind of role in hell must sacrifice everything they have in life and kill someone, better if someone they care about or some complete stranger and as a final gesture themselves.  Demons cannot bring anything out and it must be the adept who performs certain rituals to learn new things and improve level, but at each of these acts their lives are ruined more and more. Hell consists of 9 levels.  The souls of people who commit suicide are struck by the eyes little by little until they get their eyes ripped, a process that lasts years and they have to turn 15 turns before they can be saved.

50 At the end: "aye let's discuss this over  there real quick"
50 Cent: I'll take u to tha candy shop🤣🤣🤣
and after this stunt that guy went missing
50 Cent is looking old, which is I’m seeing this a lot with all the stars I grew up on as a teenager. All of which is making me feel old. I’m a good few years older than 50 cent at the time when he blew. He was only like 28 years of age at the time. A kid basically. I’m a good few years older than that (my 20’s are long gone for a start). So, a depressing thought! 😂
That’s really like a 3 -6 million dollar tab fucking with the club
Damn 50 lookin older
LOL  :)
How far away were they standing from the bar lol?

Branson cognac is retail around $260 you figure at a bar the price would be about $500 a bottle multiply that by 600 thats 300,000 and that's not including the  500 bottles of tequila and 100 bottles of hennesy. My estimate 750,000 for all.

There are limitations to being generous, this is a prime example. Why you think Genies can't grant certain wishes no matter how specific you be. Dragon Ball Z villains up here wishing for immortality, not realizing they're asking for their own personal hell of eternal boredom etcetera.

Jokes it’s soooooo funny 50 rich af but stingy in a good way
Hi
Man if I was in his shoes I'd of 1000000% Said "Run It Up!" Thats A Handful Of Pennies In Comparison To His [Actual Amount Of Cash In His Control] Now whether its Hidden or Buried (THE SMARTEST POSSIBLE WAY TO KEEP YOUR CASH, GOLD, AND GUNS SAFE) or in a Bank But on paper he made it look as he wasn't quite as rich as he is so filing bankruptcy was possible I guess I dont know the details or rules to all that but I know he played his part. Then stupidity took over and he posted millions spelling not broke or sumn n then said its fake money.
Climbing out of that debt and getting his shit together, I guess he finally done learned the difference between real friends and moochers!
Hi
😂😂😂
Dang HEAVY PENNY

Even though it's a joke. In life as you walk through it at your desired pace. You'll start to see similarities between the joke and real life interactions of relationships. Only a person with a poor mentality will act, or say something like this with an acquaintance, or worse, a friend.
This is staged af. Like they not even at a bar lmao
Bro I then watched this 50 plus times 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That sound effect tho…I’m over it 🤣😩

Ferrari you ain't on that .
he was trying 50   you know what 50 is like he realised its a joke late 😂😂😂
None of these  so called  celebrities  have all that money you think they got anyway they have what's called assets and  credit lines on those assets,  they are so called worth a amount that's their value not actual cash on hand or in the bank,  so nah he ain't paying  these people don't understand  what the meaning  of  your net worth or value  is. Those are estimates  of  your potential  and  assets,  doesn't  mean  the house you bought for 50 million is gonna sell for more than 10 million it just a asset you bought with a credit  line that you leverage. Don't be fooled OK.
😭🤣🤣😂😂✊🏾💪🏾
This guy try a be queens flip. Find your own thing homie

So far 50 has the best reaction hands down very good 👍
Dude lucky he was on camera Infront of people
100 Bottles of Hennessy (ie. Hennessy VS Cognac - 750ml Bottle $47.99 each)  500 Bottles of Tequila (ie. Patrón Silver Tequila - 375ml Bottle $26.99 each)  600 Bottles of Branson Cognac (ie. Branson Cognac VSOP Grand Champagne $72.99 each)  $4799 + $13,495 + $43,794 = $62,088  4% New York Sales tax= $2,483.52  Assuming 50 cent were to tip the bartender 18% of the pre tax amount because he rich rich = $11,175.84  In total this request would have cost $75,474.36
For one thing most bars aren't gonna have that many bottles of any liquor at any given moment unless it's preordered for a party and paid for 50 cent don't blow his money hes smart with his money

The question is what would be the cost of all that
The cost of that will be around 80000 dollars more or less.
You didn't even get the right drinks. He would have,if you asked for the right Ones
50 cent has money again. Didn't he declar bankruptcy?

50 cent what you do to Hailie bro this Eminem Diss is the Hardest Ever!  Get the information on the diss track Omg!  https://youtu.be/t_feZ7-Rvx8
I bet the club had all that ready if the order was real. Immagine him saying yes and doing it like a one time random deal just to see the outcome. Most of that wold be unoppened. First rule in this situations I belive is order if you know you can finish it yourself and no delivery. Also if you want someone else to buy you drinks to give away is also like a fraud to youre own spine. But all aside I like de idea from the back of the story but couldnt it be more itresting? Also maybe this person is saying it out loud to clearefy its better not even to think of doing it yourself. Ok.
Was there even a bartender...
At this point, I don't even think he be in front of a bartender.
This dude is tryna open his own bar with all them bottles sheesh
50 da man! Looking like Tony Montana!
50 got the joke at least, Drake got real mad with the tobacco joke
🤯🤯🤣🤣🤣
He needs a bar 😂🤣😂🤣
biggest flex is wen they say yes
😂😂😂
😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
😂😂🤣🤣😂😂
I usually love these but let's be reality, no way he gets that close to 50 and then makes that order while tapping on 50s chest. You can't just walk up on 50 nah mean so this was super duper staged. That's what we doing now? Maybe they all were?
God Loves You Remember That 🙏🏾✝️❤️
Get Mayweather next.. and he's foolish enough and would pay for it🤣🤣

How tf do waiters/waitresses do that? I can't remember what I ate for breakfast and they somehow remember an entire tables order (2-8 orders( plus drinks deserts !!! Plus they got orders from other tables! If I had a couple order drinks + apatetizers while the couple behind rhen dud tge sane 99% likely I mess an order up. It's kind of intimidating as I'm late 30s and never did college and I'm always wondering if all college students are like that ??
50 was like… not today 😂😂
50 didnt look like he liked playing like that.. I dont blame him. Kinda of a shit move . Love 50💪🙌

The look on 50 cent's faces priceless 🤣🤣🤣
Nothing like spending other people's 💸💸💸💸...Even 50 cent looked slightly concerned for a second.. That would have been a lot of alcohol!!
John 3:16 "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." 🧡💙🧡💙🧡💙  God has showed his compassion and love to each of us. This deep sense of love he has for us, has been shown when he willingly placed all the bad things we have done onto Jesus. He did this because we needed someone to pay the price for our faults, and he has given us that someone. This means that while we are doing so many things in our lives that are not good through God's eyes, he has made a way for all the bad we have done to be forgiven.  Jesus is the only one God has given to us from Heaven for us to be saved. We can never save ourselves, and God knew that, that's why God has made a way for us all, so that if we repent and turn from our ways,, we will be saved. 😁
🤣🤣🤣

Top 10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners ever!  1. Always go to other people's funerals, or they won't go to yours. 2. If everything is coming your way, then you're in the wrong lane. 3. There are three kinds of people: Those who can count and those who can't.  4. The Big Bang Theory: God Spoke and BANG! it happened.  5. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it.  6. Nobody's perfect. I'm a nobody. 7. My mind is like a steel trap, rusty and illegal in 37 states. 8. Who is "General Failure" and why is he reading my hard disk?  9. All generalizations are false.   10. Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time.    Perhaps the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
