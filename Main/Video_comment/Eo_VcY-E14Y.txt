What do you think, is it worth the price tag?
20 Jahre zu spät.
The best feature is its stylish design, is it one of the rare SUV's worth that kind of spend rather handling tech involved should presented drastically awaits lauched mods updates postslosingac sonprivate?
What you on about losing phone signal??? If you download the maps beforehand the sat-nav always works… cause guess what…? It uses SATELLITES (GPS) not a phone network to locate you. Dope.
Worth more ok. Still a ferrari like this under 400k
Czysta moc bez turbo tych silników elektrycznych i tego calego gówna ktore za chwilę może sie zapalić i być zagrożeniem dla innych !V12 , 6.5 litara i 740KM !! TAK TZYMAĆ FERRARI TO JEST PRAWDZIWY SAMOCHÓD A NIE PRZYRZĄD DO JEŻDŻENIA Z SILNIKIEM OD ODKURZACZA NA 200km i zaraz ?trzeba albo ładowac albo naprawiać !!👍👍👍👍👍👍
A V12 all-wheel-drive four seat Ferrari, what's not to like? Yeah I'll have one . . . . now if I can just find a lazy half a million dollars [$AUD]
Ferrari is the epitome of quality, speed and design!
SuV # FuV forza Ferrari.
Oauu! I love Ferrari!  Drive safetly and good lock! ***
Love it!  Hope to scoop one under $200k is a few years!
New title: "Ferrari Purosangue DRIVEN: Worth £800k???????? No. "

This is how top gear should be. No silly pranks just in depth car reviews 👌 PS. pre-download maps before driving in off-grid areas 👍👍😂
BSb car A TOyota does beter mouhahaha
Dude hahaha your are not driving this well...
It's a Fiat with ferrari engine and badge. Also all the small criticisms Tom has are total common sense things that Ferrari should have absolutely done. No mechanical start button. The joke dash with it's rotary dial.
The music used at 10:24?
💩
Ugly looking in my opinion. Stupid name that most people can’t pronounce.
This is one Beautiful Ferrari
I need to get the installment price for the latest SUV farrari
Price quote for farrari SUV latest
How to buy or how much is the latest SUV farrari
Much more expensive brands and models but neither one  functional and puresound like
All vehycle drive
1/2 million dollars car does not have a map 🗺️ 😂
FUV WOULD ONLY SAY PEOPLE WHO GOT PAID FROM FERRARI LOL
400,000 dollars , ferrari is exagerating but if there aer enough idiot to pay that amount should remember the URUS beats it in accelartion and size at half the price ill take the URUS
"Starting an engine should be a more mechanical process I actually want a button to press". How about actually turning a key? Or is that too mechanical for you?

msg to Top Gear, secret of maps… you can download them so they work offline especially in your domestic country 🖖
Impressive this video is sponsored by and features the Man himself:  Tom Ford.  Looks a little worse for wear but , eh at least he still loves his Ferraris!
This guy's a pretty decent presenter but I miss the cheeky side of top gear
100% rip off Ferrari. Proof that money could buy Ferrari
If Ferrari donates one to Ukrainian Military, I will weld and install a roof rack, a ladder and an external canister mount FOR FREE. Got examples of roof racks in my vids.
Thanks god 4 this cars still🤔
That’ll be one of the fastest depreciating cars on the planet. No idea what that car’s trying to be.
Google map can be downloaded beforehand! You can have satnav without signal easily!
I want to drive this thru Napa valley
Какой же он убогий. похож на очередной китайский зикерт! Ламборгини УРУС красивее)у ламбы вид ламбы остается
Thank you for this excellent review.
No its not worth the price. My neighbor got this does car pooling with it. When she gets her son and mine from school, her son sits in the front and puts mine in the bank. My 5'7 14 year old cant sit in the back well, head hits the slanted rear window. Its VERY small in the back.
I would take one. Red one. Pretty sure its a very special car giving special feelings. Great toy.
日本車でも、日産スカイラインクロスオーバーがありましたが、トヨタクラウンクロスオーバーもFR ベース車でこんなんだったら良かったです。
I now know the power of a badge and name. If this car has a Piguet badge on it it wouldn't feel special. But it does because of the name. Of course the v12 helps too
To answer the question... No.
This car looks small
Thanks for the video, i wasn't sure whether this or the Urus was in my price range and i established, i cant afford either!
Ferari is definately passion ,
Amazing piece of engineering on so many levels (not least of all that amazing V12), but IMHO the front just looks like a Honda, or a Yaris or any of the other generic crossovers.
Just use sygic and you have your gps even in non-gsm areas
No ferrari every is worth that amount of money. It's really the name you pay for. They could put a 600k sticker on it and the same amount of people will buy it as for 400k.
Reminds me of Mazda RX8
terrible presentation
The side looks a lot like the Mazda CX4😅；the appearance of Mazda is still very advanced
In the contemporary auto industry trends full of dull, similar plastic craps with pathetic small engines, Ferrari saved the soul of a true car, but only for the reachest. Probably when all of us will eat insects and drive boxy soulless e-crap cars, the owners of such true cars will eat true steaks also.
One more episode can't afford to buy.
It's definitely worth 400 K because now someone can flip theirs sell for over $1 million.
Nissan quashai or ninssan note?
400 k and then no sat nav, sorry, never ever!!
Superb video, Tom. More of this, please. The 6.5L V12 engine, really amazing ️ great work .
Give £150K instead for the Audi RSq8, it's more beautiful inside and outside, more comfortable, much safer and equally fast.
Ferrari be pimpin' 😅 They laugh all the way to the bank thanks to deep pocket dumb fanboys.
I want you to drive a Nissan GTR nizmo
CX30 with a V12
Very good car, but price :(
Really great presenter 👍👍 Enjoyed that
Ferrari SUV 😱🤬
Just wondering if those back seats have completely folded down yet.  Good Lord.
Классная машина. Наконец-то Феррари подходит для России.  )
Mazda rx8 😏
Not a SUV because it would destroy any of them on a racetrack 😮‍💨
Kr u redu voziček ...
Does it come in Automatic? 😂
Straight pipe and tune by GINTANI  maybe an exhaust from them as well  make over shit then off to NOVITEC for a final touch in aero
Looks like an KIA
Wish someday i will able to buy the wheels 🛞 only
That's not a Ferrari. It's a SUV. This is not what this brand represents.
they could price this even 800k and still would sell. this is one of those car that even if you had the money you could not buy it, i bet you have to own a couple of ferraris to be even put you on the waiting list.
Chhhhheat

Way better & cooler than a Lamborghini Urus, which is basically just an overpriced and restyled Audi Q8. I have no interest in an SUV. But if I did, this would be it.
So its a Ferrari made for F fanboys who got older and have a family now, so they need to take their kids with them but do not want to get off Ferrari. Bcs noone else will "comfortably" fit in these back seats. What a great car wow.. Just tells that F managers got too jealous by Lambo Porsche and the rest of them who already released their SUVs and made profit.
Now 20000000 millions billions dollars for u babez 〽️
Why are all the journalists so hung up on saying it’s an SUV when the manufacturer doesn’t see it as such look at the car it is a lot lot smaller than any traditional SUV. It isn’t as long as an SUV. The fact that they label it as something else is there prerogative get over yourselves and review the car stop banging on that they don’t call it an SUV for God sake.
Ugly front and back, my opinion.
Why is that dirty guy reviewing a ferrari?
So it’s gonna depreciate like crazy, be unreliable, has suicide doors, has a crazy high revving n/a engine, do single digit mpg, has surprising amount of space in the rear and a nice interior. It’s basically an RX8 🤙
Where Cockpit???
Oh God top gear has the best presenters. 👌🏻

After watching this some new Top Gear clips I can say damn, it's boring. Just stating fact. Looks like every over motor show out there.
A cat has got to be a cat, a dog has to be a dog, and Ferrari has to be Ferrari, but I think they misunderstand the market. The purpose of SUV's, in that, even FUVs are designed to carry the family about, so why do I want an overpowered, corner straightener which will throw my passengers from side to side, violently. Is it overpriced, I do not know, but, for the money and the purpose of an SUV, I would opt for the Bently equivalent, stick a hundred thousand quid into the kid's college fund and call it a day. If you are in a hurry, the Bently will do 289.68 KPH, for Christs sake.
It's not an SF90.
Not to mention, it gives you the flu
4seats is not practical. Make it 5, Ferrari.
During hair pin turn, you drove all the way to the other lane 😅😅😅 Pretty scary , like you drive without concerning the others on the road.   Please drive to your side of road, keep safe, for everyone

$400,000 Base Price USD.   Trust me, people are showing up in droves to purchase these in the States. Dealers have a 2+ year waiting list PLUS they're up charging $50,000 for the rare privilege of owning one. Your "Base Price" quote doesn't portray the actual cars people are buying. Try upwards of $500,000 with options, then add taxes, fees, Insurance (ouch!) & upkeep. If you aren't prepared to spend $500,000 for ownership, move on.

A grossly overpriced Italian mazda cx5 with a cheap sounding exhaust and underwhelming interior... bravo ferrari

This car is a masterpiece. Perfect family car, perfect GT.
looks like a sparkly santa fe
Rome gone wild 😂
$430,000 USD and still can't beat a $130,000 Tesla Model X plaid. LOL  You're paying an additional $300,000 just for the name brand, that's it. Otherwise, the Tesla will wipe the floor with this little Ferrari.
Статистику поломок за два года эксплуатации данной модели , зарегистрированных официальными сервисными центрами хотя бы Америки и Европы - подскажите где посмотреть? Интересует статистика тех экземпляров, которые "пробегают" не менее 30 000км/год
Saying “it gets prettier the more you get used to it” means it’s ugly.  Car companies have been making a ton of ugly cars lately
thats an rx8 guys
Забудьте это всё отсталое гавно!!! Любой Китайский авто за 150.000 в 10 раз лучше этого.

why it looks like Prius from the front?

No car is worth that kind of money, that said, it is a beautiful vehicle. It is not a valid question.
the new c63s weighs as much as this
I think it is a great car, but fails at being an SUV for existing Ferrari super car buyers.  If I played in this realm, and had a Ferrari super car, I would still be purchasing a G Wagen for my SUV.
Looks like a KIA
А на Русский язык переводить не нада, да???
I think you really do have to be a Fezza fan to appreciate this car, it just left me cold and the engine is wasted on such an ugly pointless lump of a vehicle, just my opinion.
Lamborghini Urus left the chat
Why do I need this sh-t, if I can buy an airplane for it's price?
To me it looks like a real life hot wheels car. Absolutely ridiculous and no aesthetics.
унылый тип однако, топ гир не тот больше...
is this a Urus?
Another lame hyper SUV.  Stick to making sport's cars.
I’m sure it’s nice to drive and it has a great engine but it’s ugly imo
I guess I'm in the minority when it comes to the design. Front has zero personality, lines are not sleek and the back looks like some Korean SUV... Even if I had the funds that's not the Ferrari I would buy.
its a pos with a V12
Purosangue -vs- DBX -vs- Bentagua -vs-  ........ The Ferrari is the priciest and the smallest.
I don’t know why the trend exists for petrol heads to rev cars to the rev limiter but it sounds awful, like a obnoxiously loud cd skipping.
I wish ferrari still produce naturally aspirated mid engine cars smh
Это топ гир?! Это не топ гир
What an abomination. I pray for the future of Ferrari
its just a souped up smart roadster
It looks like a Prius
Its not and never will be worth a house. but if your a sucker you will own one anyways
Bettee looking than the Urus, if i had the money thid would be the one
Here's the problem with Ferrari reviews.  It's a well know fact that Ferrari blacklists anyone that talks badly about them or reviews them negatively.  That being said, no ferrari review can be believed UNLESS it's negative.
I don't like its design at all, it looks like combination of Mazda CX-3 and Porsche Taycan, really look "electrified", I hate that smooth tipe of design of todays cars! Only respect I have to this model is V12 and interior, which are homework for the Urus that did almost everything right except screw up the V8 engine and make it actually an Audi SQ8! Even it sounds like Stelvio V6!
Don’t care how good it is-£400k is insane
For 400K I'd be heading to my local estate agent - not the car dealership!
whos this I'm watching?? where is the real top gear journalist ?
What it is is a money grab
So like 8 mpg?
Holy shit! Ferrari make the CH-R concept car!!!
not worth 400k. maybe 100k only because its Ferrari
It’s an SUV with a Ferrari badge
LIKE
Im gonna to buy it to drive to the speed limit and to go to the mall. All that power to go 70mph on the highway!!!!!
Really nice Mazda
blemish who perfume
what is this smell and blotches
capische spritz with what?!
Not worth $400K . Lambo Urus looks better in n out but cheaper .
It's a good time to be a mom.
Damn an urus looks so much better it’s insane
what a scarce design, what a clown car I want back my 90s with F40 and 575 maranello having iconic design
Love Ferrari. Love their passion and what they stand for. I may just buy one soon.
Amazing car and engine but that’s not worth more than a cullinan, I’d get that for about 250k
this thing is cool for an SUV but in the "practical Ferrari" category I'd take an FF or GTC4 10 times out of 10 over this.
its price is 400k but its worth 20k. there is a big difference with "price" and "worth"
Beautiful vehicle, only wish the demand for these types were less than 4000. These cars at that price should be in museums or rare care collections. anyone who pays of 200 k (plus) for a car is juvenile due to the opportunity cost they sacrifice. Despite one's income, the impact that can occur with that kind of money far outweighs a child's ambition to sit in a shiny thing. Unfortunately, many are still children not at heart but in their narcissistic imagination.
Wheels are kinda small and looks not so muscular. And rear seats are very small also. Not impressed!
And then toyota with a  toyota Crown😂
interior look slow quality, nothing impressive besides the engine
If not an SUV, what is it besides that, or a sedan? And it's definitely not a coupe so what it? Nice vehicle, but confusing process.
1st of it's kind that's why it's overpriced by 100k Ferrari stock should do well
nahhhh
Isn’t this presenter, from fifth gear?
Be a wonderful car if it didn't overheat in normal driving
SUV
A bit like the brace of estates they made for the Sultan of Brunei back in the 1990’s
I really don’t understand the fascination with fast SUVs. They are never going to be as fast or handle as well as a car, and they don’t come anywhere close to looking as good as a supercar. And for the price tag, you could buy a very fast car, and an SUV that can haul more, and handle better off-road.
i want this car
If I had enough money to consider buying a 400k car, I wouldn't care if it's "worth it." IT has a V12 and it's a Ferrari.
35000 millions billions dollars for u babez 〽️
The company who says will never build an "SUV" eventually gave in.
Think of it as a Mazda. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Very nice, reminds me of Mazda SUV
V12 Kia
This is seriously a good looking utility vehicle, it’s stunning at every angle.
Honestly, how can you make a vehicle like this and not make it four wheeled drive. A fail from the get go
You can tell Ferrari is either paying a lot or has taken his children hostage if he is seriously saying a low down suv with no real off road capability is more practical 💀   Taller isn’t more practical when the sweepingly low roofline sacrifices cabin and luggage space. Which, with how low this thing is, is a fact 😂. An estate would be much more “practical” and allow you to enjoy driving even more whilst being kinder to the planet and not ripping up the roads.   Anyone noticed how potholes are popping up everywhere? SUVs and EVs. The act like jackhammers when water fills a small crack. If a car weighs a ton more than it really should, then the potholes form a hell of a lot faster.   God I hate suvs so much
It just looks like a Citroen suv thing your geography teachers wife gave him a loan of to get to work on time cos his Peugeot 106 broke down.
thought it was the crown by tayota
A Ferrari hatchback 😂
Kinda looks like a oversized Mazda RX8. Zoom Zoom!
This Ferrari its something different,not the audi urus
Amazing suves.
In the comments there is someone who for various fantasies due to not having seen the Ferrari Purosangue and compares it to the Madza CX 30 !!!Absolutely not!!! First of all because Ferrari has put the engine where all the SUVs in the world don't!Not to mention the interiors, the style, the elegance of the aesthetic design that makes it unique (try to believe in an SUV that runs like a splinter) Ferrari does not build any house but builds cars to evolve in what he loves most that is: the four wheels together you have engines !!
Dream fuv
Looks like a V12 Mazda
Does anyone find Ferrari Purosangue similar to Mazda CX-30?
A fatter less good looking FF, FF prices on the rise and can see why … 🧐  that aside a decent review but should have mentioned FF right from the off imo.
Did Ferrari prohibit you from comparing it to the GTC4 Lusso??!! Because, HELLO!!
The Mazda CX-30 with ferrari logo
Yeah its an SUV .  You just want to name it something else.  Typical snooty attitude from ferrari.  So when will your company win an F1 race? Hinda has been cooking all you big brand expensive brands that dont win!
The reason one buys a Ferrari is for the V12
It's a suv
Long waiting ferrari by many people i think, the car is work of art and really detailed, however its still just art or gadgets, because they rapidly stop thinking about room in the back seat during project, especially for the legs. unfortunately it looks very unfinished for suvs, they could just move the wheels back and there would be more space and these automatic doors with a button look like they added them at the last minute, forgetting that they should start with...... the amount of space with such extravagance , a separate issue is too much weight of the car, they could have made a monocoque for such a price or used lighter materials and only at 1600 kg one could talk about a sporty jam of this car. above that, this car is still fast but too hard in the corners...., but they could put in a smaller and lighter V8 from 430??, it would still be the same power and lower fuel consumption. hmm ferrari did 3s 0-100 and this is great achievement but this car is still missing a lot things
Looks like the new prius
This confirms it, modern top gear is awful. Bring Clarkson back! Bring Hammond back! Clone captain slow! The guy doing this review reminds me of my dads annoying golf buddy.
Why people don't learn to say the name well? Listen puro san gué hurts my ears and soul.
No
Mazda Cx30  !
The first 30 sec on this video is how the Ford Mach E should have marketed their vehicle. “Ford Mach E, Mustang Trim model, off road racing.
All this, just to be outclassed by a Tesla Model 3
Well...bring your Ferrari here....  https://youtu.be/8CZ_OtYixhU
Hard to follow up Clarkson, Hammond, and May but I can tell they're trying.
Midnight blue one for me please :)
Those new Multimatic dampers are incredible.  I'm amazed at how flat and stable it looks while cornering.  That's something I did not expect from an "FUV."
The design is sleek. The color is all wrong
Crossover, rater then a SUV. But that thing need Novitec!
"The headlights are actually down here, so these bits are aero channels.." - it's like pointing at a human face and saying - "the eye sockets are actually empty channels for brain ventilation, ant the eyes themselves are down here in the nostrils".. What a ridiqulosly ugly car fashion trend!
A beautiful car from Ferrari,but too expensive.
Sorry, but looks absolutely hideous.. what was wrong with the FF/GTC4 (they look amazing and sleek). I Would prefer those any day, but then again all those awful sportscarmaker SUVs sell like nothing
Fun fact... Did you know the word Jenga is swahili and means Build or Pile
Ferrari is always had a lot of baggage when purchasing them that's why I never buy them new and if it's going to be imported into the United States it will be classified by the US government as an SUV and so on the insurance companies
That V12 make that vehicle to be  worth what is worth, for the lucky rich people who can afford it.
all about Ferrari are worth it....!
로마하고 푸로산게는 페라리답지않게 멋이 없음... Rome and Purosange are not as cool as Ferrari...
I don't see choosing this over the Roma though.
Ferrari Mazda CX9 TURBO
Why would anyone need a suv Ferrari for driving in pavimented roads?   Try answering that question without something related to ego.
Excellent review top gear 🎉
It’s just a bigger FF or GTC4Lusso
Reminds me of the mustang mach e honestly
Whoa
It loooks not so good
what kinda idiot bounces the rev limiter on ice... don't quit your day job
if had the money.. i would have the wagon and suv...
nope
you will see this car around school drop off the most. Great size for the school drop-n-kiss ;)
Oh an SUV.
So it's a Ferrari Cross? 😂😂😂
Just trash
this car may not sell as expected
It's beautiful like all Ferraris'are, but I don't need an SUV; and I definitely don't need an SUV that's not an SUV!  I notice that there is a word that none of the reviewers use when reviewing this Ferrari; I'm guessing out of fear that if (they) do, Ferrari will never give them another courtesy vehicle to test....  and that word is, "crossover!"  Call it what you want, this is a crossover. If you call it anything else,  or don't call it anything else, it's just an overpriced Italian crossover... for those of you who aren't in denial.
Ferrari call what ever for rest world Ferrari SUV ❤️
looks like a Mazda 3 on steroids 😅
Beautiful audi and Volkswagen
One way to get around the mapping issue in Andriod is Google Maps lets you download a map offline so you can still navigate the roadways if you lose service.
That's a nice hatchback.
Well... 400k is an understatement, the list of requirements to access the purchase of this car alone is quite scary.  Until you step foot in a Ferrari dealership, you don't understand how disgustingly classy they are and how little they deserve your money, always secondhand, and just by not giving them your money directly, it is worth the subsequent expenses in repairs and tuning.
What was the sound when taking the hairpin at min. 14:49?
🤣🤣🤣
Okey,i know its but this engine not enough rpm bcoz tired too low spin🤔
Yes of course,but i want function dashboard displays can change anything🤔
No satnav, I mean, come on... Deal breaker for me lol
Great review. Honestly the car is kind of disappointing
cant wait till uzed 1 z  etc.  wind noise dissapointing  thanxz great review
Love this car. It looks like a GTC4Lusso hit the gym for a couple years and is now ready for a good old fashion fist fight...followed by dinner with your 😍, and a Puccini opera.
I always owned sports cars.  SUV’s seemed a waste  as 7 passenger vehicle that usually transports one person.  My first suv was a Model X as I did not feel it was a gas hog 7 seater.  I am spoiled with minimal maintenance and ability to charge at home with solar.  No more oil filters in land fills.
If it did not have a v12, I would purchase a Urus.  The car looks similar to a Juke suv.  The interior is great.  Similar options in $60,000 car plus.  Your buying it for the V12, let’s be honest.  It’s more practical as a SUV with easier ingress and egress.  Exotics use to be both performance and moving art.  Now with 1000 horsepower,  stealthy EV’s more moving art.
Top gear has gone down hill since Jeremy, Hammond and may left
Giving me Infinity fx35 vibes for some odd reason...
It's not an SUV it's a pompous 4 seat Coupè... if you go offroad (which is not "road with some snow" but actual mud, pebbles, small rocks and vegetation) you bill in 10000 euro x kilometer in damage to all the fancy carbon fiber things, paint job and especially the refined underbelly and mechanics 🤭 Better to hike or rent an actual SUV for the day...
A Ferrari review, but in blue… I won’t watch it sorry.
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Love V12’s.  Owned a AM with a V12.  Owned a Gallardo v10 almost as good.  This is an interesting vehicle but now spoiled by low maintenance Tesla Model x.  Safest suv in the world and fast enough.  I like quiet and stealth in my older life.  People leave you alone in parking lots.
Hate the name love the car
Enzo is redlining in his grave …
It's a Ferrari hatchback.
COST £400K....NOT WORTH £400K

looks ugly. looks like those korean cars.
Cool but all we want is a two-seater with a gated shifter.
It looks absolute shit.

Any car with a touch screen inside is shit.
Looks the front end of my 23 Prius o feel lucky lol
funny car , exellent and beautiful on the showcase ,its really serious that this can be good enough  in bed weather out from the garage ?????
It’s super shite

This makes me want to buy a Blue Hyundai Kona. Looks wise, I'll be close.🤣
The answer is NO.
looks like mazda
This is the least SUV looking SUV I’ve ever seen.
This thing exists only for people who already have a Ferrari (or two or 3) and would like to show up to their favorite ski resort in style. Thats it. Unlike Porsche with the Cayenne, Macan this is unlikely to be anyones first and only Ferrari...same with the Lamborghini Urus.
Nice Mazda
What a nice Mazda
More like Puromerda
Listening to the explanation that’s it’s not an suv but looks like an suv but it’s an fuv, I really understand how they stuffed up Charles Leclerc last year
7:05 -- Good to show off ...  not brilliant on the move..
why not just let us hear and see it move arse ...you guys talk to much no wonder top gear is not seen equal to the old
8:15 a Ferrari with recycled plastic???
Background awful music……..why?
The width and length are actually comparable to BMW X5 G05. BUT it is way too lower. Even Porsche Macan is higher. It is like Nissan Juke with respect to height LOL
This sounds like a paid Ad by Ferrari. This car is ugly and I doubt is going to sell well. Literally looks like Mazda CX-5. Just admit that you were wrong about a suvs in 2016 and make a proper suv.
Really enjoyed the presenters take on this. Great video, delivered well
Definitely not an SUV….
looks like a Kia
This is NO Match for el Macho Tesla.
For the price you can buy a V12 Lusso and a 488 and still have change.
Oh, another fancy suv with an even fancier designation... now that's original in this day an age! Way to go ferrari.
Mazda cx-3 with more HP
GTA needs more like this and less nonsense
Ferrari🤔 i dont want a picture of that on my wall..... no thank you
Top Gear will never be the same as it was with Jeremy and the guys...now is so dull and boring. It's not fun to watch
Finally  a Ferrari that can be driven on many , many roads in the world. Beautiful effort 👌 ; wonderful performance. Good value for money so far as am concerned.
Excellent piece of work and NA at that 👏
Looks like Ferrari blinked and joined the "me too" brigade.  Everyone has their price.  This one's so overpriced.
No.  Oh sorry, just blurted out the answer to the question in the title.
Looks like a Puromazda! It Sucks...Ferrari is in the dust!
God, didn’t recognise Tom Ford, he’s grown up and now seems credible
Family Ferrari
Topgear in the old days was fameous, now its boaring like evry other car chanel
This car is for retiree's with a large amount of cash.  They buy it, and drive it below the speed limit, because they want a Ferrari that is practical, which beats the purpose of buying a Ferrari.  Let's face it, this car sucks and the people that will buy it will suck. An SUV of a supercar brand is generally a baby boomer verhicle.
Someone has most likely farted in it so it’s junk really.
REFR stock symbol behind the tech in the changeable roof in the car...On the Nasdaq..Smart glass is now catching on!!
Looks miles better than the Lambo
Type in google blue 2023 Toyota Prius and tell me this is not a Prius suv
"I think it gets prettier, the more you get used to it". No Tom, that's called Stockholm Syndrome.
in a bit of sarcasm we are living in a world of extremes! that car cost 400 k and the panoramic roof 22k like a new dacia duster  this is one of them ,and this example we can apply in everthing some people they afford overprice items without thinking if thei spend to much or if they still have money in theyr bank accounts and other they live by the mercy of godd becose they dont have nothing
This car runs a lot of gas
id rather have a porsche S U V
Uma Ferrari é uma joia!
Uma Ferrari azul? Linda também!
Mazda
They’re sick, but I just hate the stock wheels on all of them. All of these new Ferrari wheel designs suck ass. They look like they should be on a new Honda Pilot or something. Def gotta go aftermarket. Idk who’s designing and approving them, but absolut horrible taste.
The BMW X6 did it first and now everyone is copying them.
style over substance
Look at how you're sitting (@05:26 for instance) and where your headrest is pointing. Please adjust your seat to a proper position. It not only looks stupid, it's unsafe as well.
Tom is great
The guy in Ferrari who decided to use haptic engine start button don’t belong to the industry
Lamborghini did wrong, now ferrari is doing wrong.  Lamborghini could at least make a LM sports truck. This a a Roma lifted up
Can't wait to see what novitec does with this. Front wheels do look tiny as compared to the rear. Looks like a kangaroo
purosangue dakar series..... someday?
Love this SUV! Nice move, Ferrari!
THIS THIS and this are all suvs
Great a V12 mazda🙌😂
PERFECTION ITSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!💎🇮🇹💎💎🇮🇹💎👑👑👑👑🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🌞❤️❤️❤️ 🏎FERRARI🏎 = PERFECTION💎🏎💎🇮🇹👑❤️🌞
A rear engined v8 four door with a gt balance & comfort with no suv DNA would have been incredible.
oh my god, im not surprised how boring is top gear today
Sat nav going out on phone need to pre download the map on phone if it disconnects. Ferrari knows this. Still place some form of sat nav
Like every Ferrari this car is very ugly :(
so manny people need to get fired in ferrari, for years now....di is silly what theyv came out....non sense
I believe Jesus with all my heart. Harden not your heart and do not stop believing and thinking about what his words mean. God loves, take that fact and make it awesome
Ricordavo TG come un luogo di passione e amore per i motori. Questo video trasmette lo stesso entusiasmo di un impiegato della posta che mette i timbri sulla corrispondenza. Schifo
Allwheeldrive, 12 Cylinders. I like a lot about this car. The look is fine, although it could look a little snappier/sharper and not so rounded up. But what I totally dislike is the weight. I wish for it to be a bit lighter. 1750Kg at most, or even better would have blown me away & might land on my wishlist. But in this instance, although it's still amazing, then I look at the price again, and I feel like something around 300K british pounds at most should have done it. But unfortunately, that's not the case. Maybe save a little more and just go with a Koenigsegg Gemera then haha. 😄
I like those "car experts". PURE IDIOTS.
I can't even afford to buy a nut bolt of Ferrari, but absolutely loved this review.
Looks like a expensive Mazda
If you ask if it worth it, you should not buy this type of cars
It's a Mazda MX30
Nice to see Tom Ford has a great career as an automobile journalist after his successful career in fashion
Way overpriced
For the no network issue you have a mod on waze that keeps you on track even when the network is gone
For $790k I'll take a Urus to UGR and with the money left over, I'll hire an attorney in Maranello to keep me out of jail after I do 790 donuts in front of the Ferrari factory.
What a great & honest review. Love the green! This ride is wicked. 🔥
Who are all these bots and paid accounts saying this thing is "beautiful" haha? Society have completely lost any taste.
Nice
looks like my mazda cx-5
Ну пойдет
Just get a cx30 and try to put this engine in it. Cheaper and almost similar looks.
Great Bragging Rights,  Oh that sound
I love how when motoring journo's review super and hyper cars, they chat to us regular schmoes like we have a Chiron as a daily driver when in reality we're battling to make the payment on a Kia Rio...😢😢😢
This was an exceptionally boring video given the product at hand. I found myself drifting off several times.  The presenter is very monotonous and linear and too much time soent on boring subjects not particularly important to Ferrari imo. The video really needed som tempo switching or shorter running time
ugly car, i could name 30 cars below 50k € i would rather drive than this one
Such a beauty. Germans can’t make car like this in a 1000 years. This is pure beauty, passion, and power.
2,2 Tons is not Light but i guess it doesnt matter with a V 12 inside. Still dont See Why the World needs a Ferrari SUV or a Lamborgini SUV. Whats Next Mitsubishi building a Sportscar with 400 HP in 2024 ?
Truly beautiful FUV "Car" 😼 😎
Bmw i3
The name itself is one of the most beautiful things you can imagine being spoken. So beautfiul.
Only thing I got a comment on, is if you are smart, and relied on maps because you're a moron and don't know where you're going. You'd probably automatically download the map to your region
Car porn .... ❤
👍👍👍👍
Красивая машина
Complaining about a buttom you touched once you can never make people happy😢😢😢
Each time he pronounces “purosangue” a cat dies in Florence.
how can a video on a ferrari suv be so darn boring? even the visuals couldnt save it. paused at 1:11.
6:37 this small thing is dangerous **** at a high speed. What a shame, who designed it!?
Looks like a Mazda CX that costs 20x  more lol
FUV?  F______  UTILITY VEHICLE.  I'm not writing the first joke. 😁
Im really in the ”team ferrari” but with this one i would prefer urus.. this one looks more of a womens car imo.
E' una Ferrari ! Stop.
While I do not consider myself a classical or conventional person, but if a red or yellow Ferrari paint was chosen to present this car, it would have been a blast.  While this blue paint is beautiful, I see it (out of tune) on a Ferrari, whatever class it is.
Urus>>>>Purosangue
I miss the old TG. This was really boring
They are right its FUV they FU if u buy ferrari :P
FUV not SUV? Lol 😂😂😂
Google maps on apple and android allows you to download offline maps so mobile signal in the mountains isn't an issue as long as you have GPS.
Imagine... This car with a Novitec Exhaust.
refugees in italy can design better .... hire them ferrari pls ....smh
I don't know reminds me of a Mazda
New top gear blows man.
That 22v ferrari 👌 ❤forza italia all worth it 🎉
Why is this called TopGear it is more like 1st gear sooo dull
Damn. I just spent 150k on a skin in CSGO. Maybe next year
That Mazda looks dope.
it looks like an oversized mx5 RF
Very nice to see Tom Ford back doing car reviews 👌
ppl think this is a beautiful and perfect suv just because his name is Ferrari. if doesn’t show that logo horse. he doesn’t even in top20
man, top gear has really gone down the toilet after clarkson and co left. a review of a ferrari that left me sleepy
Fun fact : 95% who actually buys this car won't watch this video. Majority are the people watching are just here to dream
zoom zoom
80s Top Gear is back !
It looks like a kia ev6  :(
Rear doors are competing against Toyota C-HR for lack of glass and visibility. Why not Senna them?
How many presenters does top gear have?
That's noice car, way better than Peugeot 4008 and Nissan Qashqai
autotrader review and video is superior to this
Gtc4lusso owner here, I see peoples not seeing really weak parts in car, just Google PTU FERRARI, this is 4RM front gearbox which will get broked after 10-20k miles, and it costs 30k$, so funny because ferrari using this since 2011 and didn't even fixed weak parts. So this is just beautiful design with very big problems in future, I can not recommend to use this daily drive or do drift.
Mazda CX 5.
Looks like Mazda. Needs to look much more aggressive. Urus 10x better
This looks like junk. Seriously
"its not a _sports_ Utility Vehicle, its A _Ferrari_ Utility Vehicle  i love how farrari made up a whole new type of car just so they didnt have to call it an SUV
Filmed boring.
its just fire🔥🔥
Can't wait for the Ferrari pizza margherita to come out
Insane
Wait till gintani tune one 👀👀
I recognize Tom Ford from some other program, but cant seem to remember which one. I'm getting old...
😴😴😴
Ferrari is only about 40 years after Lamborghini then. It was about 1983 as Lamborghini put a V12 in their SUV. The LM 002 however was  absolutely off road capable and "practical" compared with this car as YouTube textfunction is calling "poorer sangre".
So Top Gear allowed to get their hands on Ferrari now?
Give me an Urus over that anyday
Saturday evening 9pm watching this brilliant review! Who is this guy and why is he not a presenter on the show. Straight forward no nonsense report. This is the type of presenter Top Gear needs to bring back the car lovers to the Tv show! 🎉
Ferrari basically made a sexy new sports car and raised it up a few inches. And I'm here for it. 😍
Yawn
Way better than the jokers before, actually about the cars
Thats a Mazda CX30. LOL
Nice mazda
finally my dream come true they made an suv
Ferrari is red!
400.000🤣🤣🤣
i think is funny how englese says latin words
It's a PERFECT looking car imo.  Just perfect.
nice video, wehere is location?
Ugly, over designed, no classic elegance, impractical etc.. I guess people buy it just because the brand.. only situation I would see myself have one is if I already had 2-3 other Ferraris
"Ferrari is makin a SUV , we ain't got a choice , we ordering these " - Drake 🔥
400k  is there a scratch head emoji?
I hate to say, now in 2023, too many cars look like iron man faced.
Der Ferrari unter den PuffTrommeln
Not bad, took me a while - but by the end of the video, totally sold me.
There are a lot or cars I would have before this one & I really like ferrari.
Honestly the design looks like a kia suv, with this they cannot compete against the urus, not even with the q8
beautiful, but there is no car should cost 400K pounds.
this video just approved that ferrari v12 is what making ppl get excite. throwing that engine in toyota and ppl will worship.
👎🏾Looks ugly.
Opening scene above the clouds looks like Squaw Valley (or now named Olympic Valley) lol.. Killer video!!
Bro are you wwe undertaker’s younger brother ? You look a like
Mazda 😅😅😅😅😂
Mazda CX-30 body with v12 slapped in it...
Alfas Stelvio has the agile Power-Distribution to the front axle once the rear wheels loose grip - amazing feature. What I wonder: What is the steering ratio with this absolute and mind boggling beauty? Since I drive a Stelvio with a 12:1 exceptionally direct steering ratio, I don't enjoy other cars that much anymore (less go-carty).
FUV. F Ur Vehicle. Sorry, I just had to say it.
Daaaammmmmmmnnnn insane
Ferrari Mazdangue 5!
Looks like a Mazda CX3
V12 love ❤❤❤❤😊
For Aston Martin to squeeze the 5.2 V12 into the DBX
That was an awesome review of the Mazda CX-30.
Nice car but Ferrari's pricing is beyond a joke.
So, it’s a hatchback?
Purosangue means thoroughbred
Super 👌 ❤
아무리잘 만들어도...너무 비싸다...이새끼들아~~~
70% of the price is status
om mobi pasti nonton nih video yakin gw
You’ll all be impressed to know the Ferrari sued a charity to steal the name for this car. The charity was named and established years before Ferrari even announced a plan for an SUV. They stole the name because they liked it. The actions of a truly classy company. Ferrari owners can be proud to own a car produced by such a sleazy company.
It looks like Toyota Prius 2023 in front
Hot Hatch 🚙 expensive one 🔥
who would of thought that an SUV without a rear wash/wipe function didnt work!!!
Can it fit a set of clubs?🏌️‍♂️lol
They needed to build this like they needed to build an economy car with a Ferrari badge.
ya its not an SUV, its worse, its a crossover. 🤦‍♂ Its an Italian-made Kona.
You can take a picture of any part of this car, make a wallpaper from it and it will look beautiful
I have always liked Tom's car reviews.
All that time on the snow and not one comment about the chassis controls...
😂😂😂 saburu all the way!!!
End of an era. Last bastion of good cars has fallen
That Mazda cx-30 looks amazing in blue!
Ugly front.
no
Nah , it's Italian.  I'm surprised it doesn't go faster in reverse like their tanks during ww2 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The big Lusso.
A Ferrari demorou para fazer um SUV, quando fez, fez o mais lindo do mundo !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mazda cx30 Sales Will probably shoot up.
That guy is really really good at reviewing, absolute natural thoroughly enjoyed the whole video and of course the car is absolutely stunning
Damn Mazda, stop copying Ferrari!
urus>
its a mazda cx-30 its worth shit
Rather have an Aston Martin Valkyrie
Nice review, enjoyed the presentation. I started thinking, this voice sounds familiar... then realised it was Tom Ford, but less weight and a lot less hair than the last time I saw him!! The car? Absolutely absurd price.
Mazda.
I was upset when they stopped the GTC4 Lusso. I see this as more of a successor to that and raised up a bit with 2 more doors. I love it!!!
S U V !!!!
Lots of talking to excuse a horrible piece of turd.
❤❤❤❤💋💋💋💋💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
the most boring review ever in history of topgear reviews....big mistake bbc made firing the dream team
Can’t help but see this as a GTC4 Lusso redesigned to look like an SUV...
Jesus that sounds unbelievable
Those wheels are crap
So now Ferrari playing catch up to Lamborghini?
“this Quran has been revealed to me that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach.” [al-An’am 6:18]  “This (Quran) is a Message for mankind (and a clear proof against them), in order that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know that He is the only One Ilah (God — Allah) — (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah) — and that men of understanding may take heed.” [Ibrahim 14:52]
I never thought I'd say something bad about a Ferrari but, that's the new prius' front end
Yes, it is worth it. In 2023, V12 naturally aspirated V12...
Its tragic that the demand for suvs is so immense that manufacturers such as Ferrari and Lamborghini have had to make one. Having a Ferrari was cool because they make sports cars. If they just start selling vehicles that will earn them profit, I suppose we could soon see the new Ferrari tractor, Ferrari lorry, or Ferrari firetruck.
This isn't Ferrari. Ever.
It's only for the super rich to boast or better each other. For everyone else, no.
Car is so wack. Looks like a Hyundai
Tom, the "U" on Purosangue is silent :)
An FF with a left up I guess 😅
Ferrari are Right. It’s not an SUV as you only get AWD up to 4th.  Which you failed to mention. For 400 grand I’d want AWD in reverse too!
Nice but… if I will ever buy a Ferrari, it won’t be an SUV.
Purosangue thats it Amber blues in crypto in winterfall season not habit to dakar race sangueta for strada exchause for horse power headlight bit different languanged  froom the wheels  and gonna make still agresive design new bucking hamster really dont care it.
Its a horribly expensive Mazda. Such a Shame
Oh shit! Top Gear journalist is TOM FORD!! 😱
Say what you want to me it is a SUV. Period (not "purosange" period, no pun intended :D). Porsche made a good selling with their 1st SUV, so did Lamborghini and Bentley (but all of them are VW so basically not a big risk there) and since Ferarri needs to branch out as well.. what options do you have? SUV. They can call it FUV or FAP for what I care but it still is what it is. And considering how high the usual Ferrari is in comparison to a regular persons car this could be as well called a bus or La Bussari in fancy terms :)
Karınızda zengin mi Tanışmak isterim bir gece. Ama param yok
F U V not S U V.....it looks like hatchback to me..😅
Looks great in BLUE - 22.5k worth of blue (WTH?!), that cannot be right.  Also looks great when a person is next to it for scale, along with seeing it in motion.  I did not like stagnate pictures of this Ferrari when I first saw it.
it's an exotic crossovwr
Is it me or does it look like a beefy Mazda CX5?
Technically remarkable, amazing looking, will sell out.   Most will never go off road of course... and I suspect 15mpg on a good day !  Great review.
Front part of the car is Ugly
This sound is at maximum revs perfect!
Looks like the Mazda Mx 30 🤣
It has Mazda rx7 styling to me for some reason. The back and back seat leaves a bit to be desired. I think they could of gone 4 more inches in length but that's just my opinion.  And I guess you wouldn't be able to customize it outside of Ferrari in house customs.
When I think about how long i have to work to have $400k, the answer is clearly no. This car is not worth it. A house yes, an apartment yes but this dispensable item. No.
Wow another illegally parked car in London
Look like all road wagon tho
Awesome review
I love this car😜
very objective, thank you !
Look kinda small for an suv.
All I'd like to say is . . . . That was a well rounded, professional, through and quintessentially British review. Good job Tom Ford
is it me or does it look too much like a mazda
BELLISSIMO  VIDEO
Ferrari's initial claim against producing SUVs likely stemmed from their pride in maintaining the brand's exclusive image and heritage, which has been built around high-performance sports cars. Their focus on staying true to their roots might have been the driving force behind the statement, but market trends and consumer demand have influenced their eventual decision to develop an FUV. But when Ferrari eventually developed and released their FUV, it was met with acclaim due to its impressive design, performance, and features. Despite their initial hesitation to enter the SUV market, the company managed to create an exceptional vehicle that embodies the essence of the brand while catering to the growing demand for versatile luxury automobiles.
Still looks like a Mazda SUV... and no matter how good it is,  it will always be a sell-out car when Ferrari gave up the last of their principles
That's a nice Mazda
Reinvented the car
I feel sad for cars like this that are never used as intended. The real owners save them to show off on sunny days before finding out they can't drive and wrap it around a tree.
Any Urus fans💥
Hate doublespeak at end too.  Grow a set
Hate how much time is spent explaining features in car videos nowadays.  Rediculous
Well,i guess I've never seen a car worse like price/quality than this peace of shi*.Sorry people,but it's as bad that i can't find another words
On the outside it looks just like a Mazda CX-5 I think Ferrari really nailed the we want to be like everybody else
💙
👍
Ferrari:I would never build any SUV      Lamborghini Aston Martin Bentley Rolls Royce:relly?    Ferrari:No it's too lucrative!I am in.
No, its Mazda CX3 :))))))))))))))))
Not true statement about the SUV! One of the Enzo Ferrari dream was a four-door sedan and this is finally it. Nothing to do with a Suv. Bullshit talk from English ppl like always, go and check some reviews made by Italians.
Would buy this day 1  What a car
I get you Sir and I fully agree with the "Start Button" issue. It should be more mechanical. Haptic feedback "Start Button" is no different to having a performance car steered by a joystick instead of a steering wheel. Lacks involvement & emotion. With regards to the lack of rear wiper, both Purosangue & DBX have got it super wrong. Yes, it's nice & clean but the rear spoiler doesn't serve the rear wiper purpose. Atleast they should have their rear-view mirror be camera style just like in the new Defender. Great review, man.
I knew I've died and gone to hell.
I don't like it. It seems to be built mechanically well but it looks like a Mazda SUV. For that price, I don't want no one to wonder why a Mazda sounds so good? Failed Utility Vehicle if you ask me. Hmmm, nice try though. I rather drive a Model X Plaid or a Lambo SUV.
Yen newly ferrarri has starting making toyota cars with ferrari engine 😂
It’s a sedan gtc4
Ask Charles Leclerc about Ferrari :)
Looks UGLY!!!   front and rear lights are squashed, no proportions to the long white hood or rear panel, and all the air bullshit is ugly and useless because no one drives that piece of "meat" at 9000 rpm and almost never ever. I have a 458 Italia, 2015 which I drove for 56,000 miles, and F12 which I bought just 2.5 years ago and already put 12,000 on it and I want another Ferrari, but all cars after those 2 models which were designed by Pininfarina do not match the proportional slick and muscular design like F12, because Ferrari can not make a beautiful car, they all look the same and shitty. Why do those idiots stop dealing with Pininfarina? UGLY! UGLY! UGLY!
It’s a Mazda CX30 😊
After you started to drive it something changes, now I only see the new Toyota Supra front... Ferrari Supra😆
I Dont like front lights
F U V !!!
❤️‍🔥👑
Ferrari! Ho detto tutto...ciao
should be red
Ferrari - nothing more to say
Mazda
8:40 that's on you for not downloading the maps tho, literally user error
Top gear reviews always enlighten the day.
WOW‼️‼️‼️ A Mazda CX-5... on steroids
waiting for v8+hybrid
I'd take the lusso but it's a nice attempt from rarri.
I feel petty for this topgear nowadays , if G.Clarkson would review this car it would have been a masterpiece .
Theres a ferrari and then theres a porsche. Everything else cows after it.
But it's still in the class of SUVs
This guy makes the car review boring..
if it was an F16 maybe instead of a measly V12..
Thing is, Ferrari used to make cars as they wanted - now this is a car that marketing wanted
Nice looking Mazda!
good vid ... good presenter
Hello very expensive Mazda MX-30 with Italian Logo 😂😂😂
Cool car
Only women will use it.
They copy a Mazda?
Tom Ford 💯
It has the proportions of a real-life Hot Wheels car. Uncanny, but not in a good way.
Oh my God a front-wheel drive SUV from Ferrari enthusiasts count your days.... Yes I know it's all-wheel drive but it's front wheels until you need the rear.
This stupid trend changed the meaning of “SUV”. It now means Soccer mom Utility Vehicle SMUV.
ICh mache mirSorgen um die Kosten für eine Wartung! u dem Motor kommt man ja überhaupt nicht! :-)
The Premium Mazda MX-30,yes nice car.
unholyBodyshop
Ah, it is the all new Mazda CX-30, oh wait hang on...
Can someone explain an "FUV" to me? I assumed Ferrari's were bought as toys ( & investments) for the wealthy. They were largely used for fun, 2ndary cars, driven for leisure, usually clocking low annual miles. Ferrari's were also kept in pristine condition, so that the owner could "show it off". So why the heck does this FUV exist?  It is like a marathon runner taking place in a race with snow boots; or a bear in ballet attire.  Is this to be used as all terrain, rugged take me anywhere vehicle?  Is this a "transition" FUV ie; when will this be discontinued in favor of hybrid or EV?.
Panda 4x4
Nice filming, but 10 minutes is too long chatting about the car before you actually drive it. This isn’t trying to fill up a 1 hour tv segment.
This is not an SUV. This is a lifted ugly hatchback.
Can someone please tell me what happens when you open the electric rear doors in a car park, parked between two other cars?
Looks like infinity
Looks like something Mazda would make
So much to go wrong in a few years 😂 shame.
Urus Zjada konkurencję
The new Mazda cx30 😍
Внешка ни чего выдающегося. Тоже самое корейцы с китайцами сейчас делают. ВД какое-то слабое, зад буксует, перед стоит на месте.
Does this guy ever smile? He seems depressed.
Took Ferrari only 20 years to make their own Cayenne. They still didn't get the practicality aspect of it with ridiculous engine and stupid doors.
The new Mazda CX-30 looks and drives insane!
Woww😍😍😍
good
That’s not Top Gear
Bu araca bu parayı veren bagajı çok önemser mi sizce? Katlanıyor da bagaj alanı genişliyor filan🤦‍♂️🤣
This is perfection... Germans must be scratching their heads.
He doesn't know about google offline map? lol
Die Karre geht bestimmt schnell kaputt👌
Its great but nog SUV enough its like an audi a6 allroad
Even if I had boat loads of money I wouldn't buy this, ugly and not practical as an suv
All technique and no soul, made for the Chinese lifestyle materialism.
So a hatchback with a massive price tag with average looks. I'm sure it will break the cock-o-meter quite easily, and all the snobs will trample each other trying to get one.
Ferrari. Fantastic.
is that Tom Ford? Jeezus - good to see you doing stuff with cars still
I am so disappointed they should have but a w16 engine in it's hood like V12 is definitely not overkill
I cldnt help but notice that u kept drifting btw lanes especially when taking the bends and I strongly doubt u’r a bad driver.  So is the handling of the car bad or the road was closed to other drivers while u were filming and driving?
The car looks so clean, it looks like CGI from some angles 😅
Does Ferrari know anything about electro innovations or they prefer to stay 20 years late developing old good atmo?
If there was one brand that you thought wouldn't jump on the band wagon its ferrari,   well another suv , just like all the rest ...   boring
Ne zaman alacağım
Wookieeeeee!
Una cafonata per venditori di cammelli.
What a beast.
Let's agree this is not a SUV Looks Good regardless.
So this is basically Infiniti FX or QX of the modern time. Infiniti was way ahead of it's time I always knew that.
V12 suv sf90 😂
I want more car reviews by Tom Ford.
It is a very well performing car for a Mazda CX-30
Looks like a Mazda CX30
🤔, looks pretty mich alike a Mazda MX30…
Time to stop this SUV thing before any more hideous cars are made. If you want a good luxurious 4x4... get a range rover, if on the other hand you want and can afford an amazing fast car... get normal Ferrari.
We want a proper driver, someone that can push a car like a ferrari not a semi old grandad driver on a Sunday run. Zzzzzzzzz
its deserved price is 60.000 dollars.That's it....
So what? Even a Renault Clio is worth over 400K back at the time it is still a concept test car and only 7-8 of them are hand-built for the tests. LOL!
That is a insane steroide boosted  CX30
This Gentleman’s review is great. To all the “Youtube” reviewers, this is how it should be done!
2200 KG Ferrari. No thanks
Looks like a new Prius in the front, the side view a stretched Toyota CH-R. I must admit the magic happened when he opened the hood…
Nice lookin Mazda CX-30
bullshit you can't shift in corners shifters should be on stereng wheel
The engine has got to be my most favorite part about this car. Leaving it NA and not adding any EV/hybrid nonsense to it just to please the new trends
This man could bore for Britain. My god I really didn't believe that it was possible for someone to make a Ferrari sound suicidally boring.   Once again the BBC completely trainwrecking one of their most loved shows.   'He wants passion & Excitement' - So do the viewers sadly not likely with this drone in front of camera
would be a killer Dakar car
Worthless piece of advertising crap PERIOD!
🤑🐲💯🎆
not a suv,,looks crap too
There is no God.
This is probably the best YouTube video Top Gear has ever uploaded. Great review
I can say the comment about sat nav is true, I have a early macan s and the map dating must be close to when Australia was colonised. Porsche Australia don’t seem to care . I can say I love the driving experience and day to day use.
I'll have a Model X P100D. Third of the price, twice as fast (nearly). Also with Alcantara lol.
Those boomerang lights above the LED lights in the front ruin the car.
I remember top gear in a different way…I had a nap
I’m italian and i prefer Lamborghini urus
Probable 90% of these will all be boring blacked out
Cool mazda
best of both worlds, epic
This is the predecessor to the Ferrari FF
Another toy for the rich
if its  not an suv how can it be against urus,cayenne and `DBX (and not DBS as you sad)?
È una pantofola
Doeis it come with isofix?
why you cant say your height? i never understood it
look like mazda
They should’ve just kept the lusso going
Just looks like a Mazda cx5 from the side lol
FUV 🤣😂🤣😂, the absolute bullsh** companies come up with…
Absolutely boring ! The client for this car doesn't give a toss about technical stuff so there is no point in ... pointing it out for about 20 minutes... Clarkson's metaphors... I am a dinosaur !
У него привод как у финика , всю зиму будеш боком ездить
Now this does make Porsche Cayenne Turbo being reasonable
8:50 With Android Auto, you tell Google to download the map of the region into your phone but I believe you have to do it thru maps on your phone first.  I agree with it being a pain to not have a dedicated sat nav, but that's the work-around if you're in the mountains or remote as I often drive.
Nice Mazda
Thats mazda cx50 400k
That's the difference between Lambo and Ferrari - we all wanted the magical V10 in Urus, that they never did. On the other hand, we all expected the V8 in Purosanque, but they didn't disappoint.
Top gears not the same
Looks almost exactly like the Mazda MX 30. Perhaps you shouldn't buy it for the looks...
Hopefully its reliable.
Im in love  ❣️😂
I don't like it. The Urus is not a Lamborghini, and this is not a Ferrari. Sports cars should remain sports cars, I hate these things. Don't we have enough god-awful SUVs on the road?
The review as such is spot on, however I would very much like to see a comparison in specs, looks and practicability against the DBX, Bentayga and Cayenne.
This is definitely an SUV
Looks like Tycoon and CX-5 had a baby
it looks like a normal sportscar, just bigger. But it looks great :D
SUV era is done for now. Weird that Ferrari made a sin with this car at the dusk of this car era. They spoiled their reputation just when the niche is dropping rapidly in popularity.
The car as such is amazing. However, if I was a Ferrari worker or a long time Ferrari customer, it would make me quit the brand. If one brand should not have SUVs, it is Ferrari.
A Mazda on steroids; only the Mazda looks much better 🤣 This looks cheap like Playmobil, which is kinda pathetic 🥳
still looks like a mazda to me
must be red though
Double arch dashboard - mimicking the Mustang?
Paying that much for a Mazda cx3 lookalike..... not for me
It need more power
Is this Mazda ?????😂😂😂😂
no jezza no interrest
The writing on the script is exquisite. It answers all the right questions. Well done.
It is in dream only
Ferrari selling you a Mazda lookalike for 400k! SMH
It looks like Mazda MX30 for rich people.
There’s nothing special left to see on Top gear anymore. #boring
Haptic touch start button is just plain lazy from Ferrari. But the dual screens are a complete breathe of fresh air. And so elegant
Why do they have retired pro wrestler pick up truck driver looking sasquatch reviewing this, couldnt watch a moment of this because of that. I will say any Ferrari that is not the typical boring red of any kind is breathtaking.
It’s a nice car but 400k it’s way too much and if ur gonna spec it it’s probably closer to 500k. Those back seats look way too close to the front seats they need to push those back
I like the design and the V12 engine!!! sweet!!! can't wait to buy one!!
its not rly an suv just a big ass fancy sedan
Is that Tom Ford from Fifth Gear?!
Ford driving Ferrari 🗿
Nope…you can keep it.  I’ll take a GT4 Lusso, thanks!
SUPER! 😇
hey look its a ferrari mazda cx 30
but why...
Top Gear is still on air? XD
I met these 5 purosangue going to Madonna di Campiglio...the sound is incredibile and they look beatiful
first it's not a SUV but CUV let's test it on drag race
Whooooaah super gutsy sliding up that hill like that , props to you man freaking sick. Thing must feels wonderful
Toyota Prius
Its XC30 from mazda with v12
This guy reminds me of one guy from Fifth gear who had long hair.
Reminds me of my GLA 45 But way better
This is bullshit for brand, lets be honest
V12 sounds killer, but it looks uncannily like a kia from the front.
big black wheel arches on 23 inch wheels are just a gimmick to hide how FAT that SUV is.
Ferrari spent millions developing a Mazda mx-30
It's like a piece of Art 🎨Wow
Call me old fashioned but you could have dressed better - the cars nice though
15 years late.
16:08 - the rev limiter is an eargasm
Hmm doesn’t this look “a bit” like Mazda 3 or CX3? 😮
Urus is very beautiful
What an ugly, absurd monstrosity.  It dethrones the Lamorghini Urus. Oversized, overweight, overpowered, overpriced, overstyled. But to answer the question, is it worth the price tag? IMO not relevant. I don't think the potential buyer of this car would even care.
400K and no sat nav?! I'm out 😆
Basically, a mazda cx-30 on steroids
I thought I'd hate it - but I love it. Class of its own. 👍🏼
if this guy did more reviews i might start watching top gear again
I had my reservations about this car when it was announced however what a stunning looking & sounding machine. Strangely, I seem to be in the vast minority when it comes to the option of satnavs in cars. On the positive side, a built in system is of course easier to use. But... In todays technical climate, it really is a waste of money for manufacturers. So long as Android auto (or apple Carplay) is included. I believe this is by far a much better option. As for folk saying losing the phone signal is bad, Google maps prompts you to download any maps when you install it. It then prompts you to update these maps when they need it. You can also download, free of charge, any map data onto your phone so that you can fully navigate 'offline'. From experience this works a wee treat. Good on Ferrari....... Dacia do this as well to save build costs!
5 or 10 mpg when pushing it hard?
I think i' ve never seen a luggage space ability presentation in a Ferrari before. Brave new world...
Норм Тачка 👍
Mazda jeep with engine on steroids😂
0:08 doesn't engage 4wd when it spins like that????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Great review, really well done and I agree with all your positives and negatives
looks like a chinese-made car tbh
BMW X5 ///M power faster and reliabler then 4 time cheaper 😒
Hahahahahaha bumpers? They don't know a shit about them. Bumpers... Well I hope this vehicle sales incomes... Give to Ferrari the money they "require" to get out the hell hole they have been since 20 year ago in F1
When they first started showing these and all not I was like nah Ferrari should stick to 2 seaters but after looking at it this closely and not being like everybody else with a twin turbo v6, v8 or naturally aspirated v10 this thing is a masterpiece 🙌🏽🔥🔥
Looks like Mazda mx 30 to me
I want one for my dog
Mazda CX-5
It’s a beautiful car,Ferrari not taking anymore orders,people with money buying up the car production for next few years, to sell at a profit to people with even more money,for that price you can buy 3  stelvio Alfa quads fully loaded!, that saying would still buy one😂❤
Big as a bear, but sounds like a bird!
its a Mazda CX80 to me HAHAHA
400K Mazda mx-30
when is the everyday V8 or hybrid coming?
Nice mazda :D
The ugliest Ferrari EVER!
One sexy looking sleeping beauty… damn this would cost easily more than half a million in my country
Ferrari would have to pay ME to buy a Ferrari, it is not the cars it is Ferrari's arrogance towards their customers
Same as the Lamborghini SUV?
V12 is nice, but front side - Hyundai Purosangue.
really really nice video and such a beautiful car.
Best 'pour some sangria' review out here on YouTube. Thx.
You can download any map so you can use it without connectivity.
Looks like a hyundai
imagine spending millions to develop a Mazda CX-30🤣
I'll stick with my santa fe. Pretty good value
I got 20$ in my bank account and it's the 11th of March... 😂 That hood is too naked though and the panoramic roof needs to open and tilt, the car would look more aggressive and just better.
peugeot has built an incredible car for sure!
Ugly
The interior is so damn ugly and the exterior is juat ok. 400k for this? You must be joking
in regards to the phone dropping out of service if you use google maps, and load your destination and don't exit out of the app and if you lose service  it will go into offline mode and you'll still be able to get to where you were going with directions. I don't really see that as being a problem for most people who are buying this car and even in offline mode, with pre loaded info you can still see roads around you and have a general idea of where you are. I have sat nav in my car and have never used it and I've been to some pretty remote areas just always find it clunky.
He's got this car spot on. The people who actually buy this car are already Ferrari customers so they don't care about the price. What an astonishing car. I fall for it the more I see it. Sure there's a couple of little things that are annoying (the climate control dial) but remember the overly complicated BMW M5? Push one button and it doesn't matter, it becomes the ultimate driving machine and still as practical as they come.
It has a V12. Its worth 400k easily.
I dont know man, the design of many cars these days looks more and more like Chinese rip off of western cars. Some cars like the new Toyota Prius impresses me with clean and stylish lines, but the new western cars are just too over stylized. They look so busy with all the lines and all.. Cleaner and simpler lines please! :P   Another thing, all the touch screen/haptic buttons, why have governments not taken action against these new crappy interior trends. They have when it comes to shapes and stuff of the cars to make them safer but the most obvious issue for an accident to happen is not taken into account? ie when one is trying to adjust something in the car via the touch screen instead of good old tactile buttons? Governments, wake up!
perfect car for a group of young spoilt girls
it looks great but it does have a little bit of a cheap vibe to it kinda like modern bmws.  Looks expensive but at close look kinda has a cheap feel
on every shot, you crossed the median: you just can't do that. Seriously distracting and even made me stop watching before the end.
❤❤❤❤
Fanno la sf90 sbagliata pesante e con un motore ibrido e questo cesso con un v12… In Ferrari hanno perso la logica di come si fanno le auto vere .  D’altronde è il male di oggi non saper fare niente di nuovo e originale
If I won the lotto, I'd buy one👍
looks like a mazada cx 10 on outside
how many of you feel its kind of mazda xc30 look....oh noooo
Ferrari has their head so far up their own ass and the buyers are right there with them. “We will never produce a SUV 🥴”.
Has to be the only person alive that has called this thing anything other than stunning
Arriva 20 anni dopo il Cayenne quando ormai nessuno se lo caga. D'altronde anche in f1 sono abituati arrivare sempre dopo. E vivono di rendita da troppi anni. Il suv Ferrari= la fine della passione sportiva
Top gear is not in brazil. Perhaps our roads are not good enough. Our country is no safe. But we love top gear
Personally Clarkson was better
If you replace the nameplate with Kia, then no one will think that this is a Ferrari. This is the ugliest Ferrari
amazing presentation
I like this guy
Where is this filmed? Austria/Italian Alps?
nice car, but looks like a car that it will break in a weekend use for a regular family so no thanks I love my Japanese SUV.
Cayenne turbo gt ALL day
I just love this. It's absolutely amazing. Beautiful
This car so lovely, can do Uber with Ferrari now 🥰
The FUV thing is so cringy and so Ferrari ego. Cool car though but it's an SUV Ferrari
A tad pricey for a Mazda MX30
Dumbest idea ever.
Mazda CX-30😁
I'm waiting Ferrari Minivan
Great review. I actually enjoyed more than the usual suspects. More information and detailed. Nice 👍🏻
Ferrari makes this because STUPID AMERICANS.
Even if I could afford it I'd rather have a more practical Panamera and save £200k
Love that its 2023 and Ferrari still drop a naturally aspirated v12 on us. Beautiful
Better than the urus for sure…
Mazda CX30 lol
Missed watching Tom Ford!
A Piece of ART
A Ferrari isn't meant to be practical. Someone who can afford a $400k vehicle can afford to supplement it with a $50k truck or SUV if they really need practicality. This is an unnecessary watering down of the Ferrari brand.
tom ford, excellent
Familien Auto
Would look nice with a Peugeot badge on it
it looks like a beefed up 599. i like it.
I'd be nitpicking too if I had hair like that. ever heard hair implant procedure
Most actual cars looks similarly, even hyundais and kias.  Boring. Post scriptum: where is Jeremy?
1:10 Hey my shoes 👞 aren't shoes.... they are walking utility tools cool huh 😑
Love those rear doors tbf😍
It's Ferrari's Nissan Juke 🤣
Ferrari have already sold the entire production run. They look good from any angle and what anyone (who doesn't have one) thinks about them doesn't matter to the prospective owners.
100 %price worth , it is puro sangue , good for valais and montaign hausing environment ...
the bugatti is 4-5 millions, the koenigseg is 2-3 millions, the pagani is 2-3 million, hell yeah a ferrari worth 400 000.
"Is it worth the price tag" is a stupid question 🙄
Nice Mazda MX-30 😂
Never thought a Ferrari and a Prius would have the same front end😂🤣
Nice farerri😆
It’s identical to a Mazda
Шляпа , а не Топ Гир
It’s a Mazda MX30
8:38 I would use a smartphone navigation app with offline maps like Sygic or Here.
An exciting looking car that I will never drive, I just dream of a car, any car with AWD, never mind an expensive one. But that looks like so much fun in the snow.
What have we here?.. Ferrari's version of a Air Jordan Hightop Sneaker?..
Rwd suv💀💀💀💀💀😂😂😂
It actually looks great. Futuristic without unnecessary extravagance. I love the short overhangs which are not a usual Ferrari feature.
this ferrari needs a DOUG SCORE..!
This host guy gives me Sean Bean vibes. i like it
Well you're DEFINITELY going to want that 'Carbon Ceramic Brake' package to avoid any potential BRAKE FADE when you take your Purosangue on TRACK DAYS every weekend!
Looks like mazda mx3 to me🤣
looks like a hyundai tbh LMAO
I would buy a Hellcat and still have enough money left over to get a mansion.
Great colored car
Top Gear would be so brilliant with just Tom and Chris presenting. This review was literally all we need to see, entertaining and informative.
old topgear was better
Loving the color blue. What’s not to like❤❤
400k for recycled plastic bootles? Give me a break!
Smart to run with a V12 to keep the journalists happy. No doubt the next one will be a v8 hybrid once the initial shock of a Ferrari SUV has died down.
This thing is amazing
I just download my maps, duh... 🤷🏻‍♂️ That car has too many ugly angles, nice technical solution for 2.2 tons, but completely unnecessary. No one needs this car, except for attention. No one will take their family, in an SUV, on the race track. And not racing regularly with 4 people, it's a downside too, having this much weight with you. This is just a: "we also need an SUV in our portfolio, but won't even admit it"-car.
Man , I need to win the lottery Asap
Ferrari spent millions developing a Mazda MX30.....
once you have loaded google maps using data/wifi etc, does it not then work soley from gps??
If you can afford this car, you can also afford a phone plan that works worldwide and never loses signal. Also, as any Apple CarPlay user can tell you, navigation keeps working even without signal as long as you started it with signal. There are also offline maps which you do not always get when you have a proprietary GPS.  I actually find Ferrari's approach to navigation to make a lot of sense: instead of re-engineering an infotaiment and navigation system that goes obsolete after 2 years (hello, Audi), they let that work done by the best companies in tech: Apple and Google. So they can focus on what they know how to do, which is the car itself.
Umm there is this thing called offline maps... so that's not an issue.
Instead, buy a Range Rover and an actual Ferrari
Looks like the mustang mach e. Ashamed. I thought Ferrari would of at least make some changes to a design. But meh same thing as an Mach e,  instead of hot wheels it's a matchbox. Design for the back is meh not worth the 400k. It can become beautiful but it's missing way to many shape to it
The front looks a little compressed.. Cld have been more thicker./lifted to make hood parallel to ground.. Feels pinched in the front
bruv what you on about? remove the badge and it look like a kia 23 model
I’m a Ferrari over Lambo guy most days of the week but this new “over sleek” look of Ferrari’s latest cars just really isn’t the one. Especially jumping into the SUV market where aesthetics are way more valued. They’ve missed a trick on the Urus’ aggressive look.
What Lamborghini Urus ? N/A V12 vs TT V8 .. 100% Italian Ferrari Chassis, Engine, & Gearbox with outrages Suspension vs 85% VW Parts glued in Lamborghini glue .. just look at the damn thing, its a Ferrari V12 with 715 HP 🇮🇹
This is the end of Ferrari, 20 years from now they'll be making school buses and vans.
The solution to a problem that didn't exist.
This presentation, mind you, of this one of a kind Ferrari managed to get me bored to the point I had to quit midpoint! 👏👏👏 Congrats
7 commercial interruptions in one video, how 🤑 is that, Top Gear!
I'd rather buy the Lotus Eletre for a 3rd of its price
Alfa Romeo Stelvio on steroids...
*its an SUV*  *get triggered now*
Silly name
Looks like any new hybrid crossover🤮
GT4C Lusso with 2 extra doors and a 1.5" lift
Really like this guy, great car
Very good
Competitor for Lamborghini urus😝👍
So if you got a flat tire...and there's only one spare wheel... what do you do because the front wheels are smaller than the back wheels by an inch
it looks like a mazda....
what a bunch of silly hypocrites...so they make statements about not wanting to make an SUV then watch all their rivals make ones; and now they make one and just to save a non-existing face they call it... FUV ??!! really?
These are meant for women
The front is not good. Looks like a normal Hyundai these days.
There is nothing to say about SUVs🥱. But would there be potential here. ? Really nice details☺️👍🏻. The driving pleasure is certainly top-notch, but is it still too much for an SUV🤔
welcome back tom ford.
I have a 12 dimonsional ferrari watch....lol..im satisfied😉.
I must be sick or something. I got bored at 10:00 onwards. Maybe  it is the carbohydrates giving me ADHD.
Love cars with v12 , thanks
Beautiful car and concept indeed.  I hope the build quality and the serviceability overall has improved as well.
What happened to the old 3 hosts... they are best host I have ever seen for cars...
Give me Clarkson back
Sounds great, but looks horrible
Have you seen a Mazda CX30 ?😂
i hate the light thing lol
FU-V?! HaHa! That’s genius! When I first saw the thumbnails I thought it was a Mazda or a Mach -e.  If I had the money I’d buy one just so i can say i have an FU-V!
Why they copy everything from the Range Rover. !!
Absolutely approved - beautiful 🙌🏻♥️
I really hope I see someone chucking out an old bathroom at the tip, from their Perusangue! 🚽
It looks like a Ferrari F12 Pininfarina that swallowed a Subaru Crosstreck
The name that describes this vehicle is one that has been pushed to the side. This is the text book crossover .
Obvionsly it’s not an SUV, it’s a high sitting hatchback
Corvette's CUV is going to be literally a direct clone!
Looks like a Ferrari FF
Looks like a mazada cx-30
This entire thing is a monstrosity.. And this is coming from someone who is a Ferrari owner.  MONSTROUSITY
It looks like that ghastly mustang EV   If the Ferrari Roma was a peep and you stuck it in the microwave for just long enough for it to start inflating, you’d get this  The first thing I think when I see this car is: highway safety regulations.
Looks like a overpriced Mazda CX-3
Prius
It looks like a taller 2023 Toyota Prius
NO Ferrari is worth it. Buy Lambo or damn near anything else before this pretentious gutter trash company.
Quietest V12 Ferrari ever made - can't wait to hear it with an exhaust.
I’m not a big fan of sports cars, this would be my dream machine.
Lmao why don’t they work on their reliability and mechanical issues first
Whatever it looks like a cross over then😂
This is basically an ultta luxury crossover hatchback with a V12 and sporty bits
It’s perfect  Beautiful  Nice  Everything fantastic
Actually way cooler and nicer and faster than I thought it’d be… I like it all except for the interior panels/tools as you stated - like what if it broke and wouldn’t come up you just have no air control lol!? Really weird looking but it grew on my throughout the video - if it had different wheels it’d be better. And that soundddd 🤤
It was cool until he mentioned the price. At that price I think I'll just get a SF90 lol
I prefer any Mazda CX - Anything than the Purosangre (In Spanish)... Even I could afford it.
No no no. Is not Ferrari!
Surprised that they made an SUV and used FF/Lusso style rear seats with not much more room  Anyone thats owned an FF and or Lusso , sucks to see that these seats dont look more comfy... i loved my ff/lusso but man the daytona seats, etc just weren't really cushy at all..... the way he got in and out of rear and the opening of the rear door looks so claustrophobic !  Another note the rear door fully swung open, have to really watch where you are parking and who is next to you, cant really position it open manually in a tighter space? maybe you can hm
Too bad, like the 296 GTB, that the exterior is god awful ugly.
Kia looks better
Hello mate! Where ya been?! Glad to see ya around
yeah get a RSQ8 more the space and enought power no need to pay a gazzilion dollars
Maybe worth that for more seats and cargo
can this dude be any more boring
Damn 23's from the factory on a ferrari. Crazy
Psalm 33 verse 17  An horse is a *vain thing* for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.
This is art, the car is something new in the market
I thought I was going to hate this thing, but I actually rather like it. I wouldn’t want it as my only Ferrari, but as a second one yes please.
It looks amazing but for some reason the front tire width looks very thin.
Kona N
The problem with these reviews is that they take a small stab at glaring and obvious deficiencies but can't resist to suck up to the brand otherwise they will be on some sort of black list .  So, lets review,  zero SUV utility, crap sat nav, totally and utterly over priced, " beefier interior" in conjunction with quasi SUV or off-road is a oxymoron, re-cycled Alcantara is nothing short of idiotic, and virtually zero luggage space for four people.  In other words, a complete waste of money.  The waffle of the reviewer is sickening ("this is a SUV" - after saying its not - on how it goes into a turn).  I can't wait to read the off-road review and enjoy the carbon bits falling off left and right!
Its the age old thing,the start button for instance,Times progress,if it was like the standard on a brand new car it was not be advancing ! Times change & car inovation changes .
Ugly. Doesn't do anything very well. Stick with sports cars.
LOL, far to expensive. Nice commercial project thought, 40k and i am in
The design reminds me of a Mazda CX-30
6:35 NO ONE COPY THIS!!!!!
It will never be a Porsche - next !
What are the chances it’s not reliable , pretty high but hey it’s Ferrari
Its super cool, but come on FUV 🤦
This guy talks to much. Shhh, let the V12 do the talking. No one gives a shite about anything else at 400k. 😂
Looks like a BSUV.
Worth 400k, no. Will people still buy it just to show off, yes.
Closest thing i can think of as similar shape is 5 series gt
Ferrari nailed it
What Sergio Marchionne said about Ferrari not getting into the SUV market was exactly like former CEO of Porsche  Wendelin Wiedeking when in the 1990's he said on a interview that Porshe would never build a sedan. Years later, surprise surprise: The Porsche Panamera was born. These companies only care about trends and the money it brings. The vision of the people who created the brand is completely disregarded. Enzo Ferrari must be rolling in his grave now, knowing that this abomination has a Ferrari badge.
Oh how they laughed at the RX8 rear doors
maserati and ferrari made some babies xD
This guy is such a snob. Just enjoy the driving mate, you had one of the best cars on the world under your ass...
Fabulosa..! pero la terminación de los escapes es totalmente antigua..! no van con la buena estética..!
This car is so friggen sick
I miss the old 3, Top Gear just isn't good anymore
Absolutely fantastic. But then, it should be at that price 😰
400K !! no way i'd buy this ferrari, i would buy a lancia kimera 037 for myself and a stelvio QV for the family,  enough for my life and happiness.
Hmm...wenn ich jetzt fies wäre..ein Hyundai Kona mit toller V12 Maschine🤣  Die Optik dürfte Geschmackssache sein..gerade weil es ein Ferrari ist-meins ist sie nicht..  Den Innenraum finde ich bis auf die Lüftungsdüsen(die erinnern mich eher an die eines I20 der ersten Generation 🫣) gelungen..  Vielleicht sollten Ferrari aber auch Lamborghini die SUV Idee ganz vergessen ..den Urus finde ich persönlich jetzt optisch auch nicht wirklich schöner als nen DB GLC/ GLE...im Gegenteil.  Alfa Stelvio hat was...gediegener Italo Charme als SUV..aber ohne das klassische Alfa Styling zu verwässert...passt da evtl der V12 rein? 🤣
Damn - this FUV kills all SUVs in the market atm.
I just threw up in my mouth a little. Oh ferrari, what have you done!
£320,000 yep for a SUV …..😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
always funny to see Ford in a ferrari
wasted review on a pointless suv that 1% can afford ..
Amazing
Пурген.
So it's Like Peugeot 408
Needs taller tire profile or the arches need shrinking. Everything else looks great but the wheel/car ratio is slightly off to my eye.
Just buy 4 range rovers and all 4 of you can have as much legroom as you want
If they let the production run free then Ferrari will sell more of these than Greggs will sell meat and potato pies. They won’t be able to sell enough of these. Regardless of how much they cost.
Putting the V12 in there is pure class from Ferrari. Love it. Going to get one when my numbers come in from the lotto.🙏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I love it
I would not say it is my favorite Ferrari, cause it is not, but I must give them that they did make it original compared to other SUV's.
4:40 You don't look like you just "jumped" in. You definitely look like you SQUEEZED in, but Ferrari will probably cancel you if you said that, lol.
Good video good host👍
“You’d never take it off road to test its all wheel drive capabilities”   WhistlinDiesel: “and I took that personally”
https://youtu.be/VH34w3_xIMw
id*ots are those, who wait for two long years and pay 400k for it !!! After 2 years no longer an up to date car.
Top gear is still just mehh
I'm sick of that trend of separating the headlights from the LEDs ... from Hyundai, then BMW, and here is Ferrari doing the same thing!!! why ferrari,Why didn't you leave the front bumper clean or put fog lights in it and put the  headlights in one of the big holes above and below the front LED lights??? Also a super SUV or FUV with electric suicide doors? Come oooon ferrari ?!  am an athlete so let me  close the door and open it myself !!! Also I can't imagine myself owning a half-million-dollar car and not being able to control the songs I listen to while I'm driving, while someone is sitting next to me messing with my playlist and pissing me off... Where's the manly driving mode change stick in a v12 half milion car ???!!! I still prefer the URUS😩
I like a lot that look... But since I don't have the money to buy or maintain will probably get a good looking toyota prius
iT'S  a mouthful, and you'll need a gob full of money to get one with.      calling all POST-COVID MILLIONAIRES
iT is AN suv
Wow. it's a new Toyota Prius?
Beautiful car, BUT those Headlight's ..... >.< They should have been in the gap above the LED Strips!
It's a SLV=sport luxury vehicle
If you want a Ferrari for the road, this is the one! Everything else is too fast for the street so you can't enjoy it. This one, Analog V12 with four seats, the best idea ever!
Probably drives better than it looks
This is a masterpiece of science and epic
I love it 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Faster 0-60 than a Porsche CGT
Looks like an ev6 in the front
Wow it just looks like some ford or whatever...
Rory said 7speed transmission and TopGear says 8. Which one is it?
SUV
Blimey if Enzo was alive to see this he would sack the designer’s, middle management and whichever Senior person gave this the go ahead in fact I would be amazed if he did not to set fire to the factory! This is not Ferrari I feel the great man will be physically sick
Car reviewers are always fairly tall and get get in and say "I'm fairly tall and I fit ok" I say this as a slightly shorter, very trim man - try that same test with a big (fat) bloke, with back fat. They're gonna struggle. And no, I don't think cars should be built to accommodate that, but it just shows that being tall and fitting isn't the only indication of space.
As a big and old Ferrari fan, this doesn't convince me it's not an SUV, neither does it convince me it's a good SUV, and it convinces me even less that it's as special as Ferraris from a few years ago - and the same applies to the 296 GTB and the Roma. I used to get excited every time Ferrari launched a new model. Now, they just seem like another very expensive brand with nothing special. Very sad.
if your phone loses signal, chances are your sat nav would have too, no?
Is it nice? yes Is it worth 400k? no
Ferrari 🔝 🔝 🔝 🇮🇹 🇮🇹 🇮🇹 💪 💪 💪 ❤❤❤
400 000 euros for it? a joke?
Watches you guys video about Purosangue and then watches Evo video about Purosangue and both of you use the same Clip for this ice 0:07 LOL You guys sharing video asset now?
If you use google maps then if you lose data you still can continue using the maps ive never had that problem you just dont get live traffic updates
comparing to the Lamborgini urus, the design is not that special.
nice skids
Complete garbage! Dishonest crap! Loathsome bullpoo!
Still looks like a glorified Mazda cx-5
Superb video, Tom. More of this, please
Ahhh finally. A car that i need.
I feel a little stupid. In the beginning of this video i was thinking "i like this presenter. He's got a Tom from Fifth Gear vibe." ...yeah, i wonder why.. 😄 Different hair, very different hair, fooled me. Anyways: I loved his style back then, and still do. Relaxed, personable and informative. Good job 🙂  The car: I will make it a point to call it a SUV at every given opportunity, because they're taking the piss. ..but: In a world of badge engineering i respect Ferrari for doing their own thing, and - especially - for adding a N/A V12 to the mix. My opinion on the price doesn't matter as i'm FAR from being able to afford even running such a car, but i do love that they did this. Showing the rest of them how it's done. ..and: While too busy for me when looking at the details, i love the overall look of it. Something i can't say for the many big SUVs out there.
Super knowledgeable review… 🎉
Why does it look EXACTLY like the Mazda CX-30? I'd just buy that instead for 10% the cost lol.
it  looks like mazda 3 sportback
Materials are not that expensive to build such a cars,so no its not worth 400k I would say build of this car costs around 30k
Wow, what a great car. Looks amazing. Cool video guys.
It definitely looks like a typical compact SUV, just musclier, Don't tell Ferrari that haha.
Another way to offload money from the gullible. FUV?
This is not an typical suv but just crossover with screaming v12. Smoothing like your t roc with longer bonet and arches
Its awful, as is the Urus and Bentayga. There isnt one SUV from any high end manufacturer that looks nice
That's why You have offline google maps...but true...for that kind of money, Ferrari should have included Sat Nav.
More Sport cross than SUV perhaps a FAV - Ferrari Activity Vehicle  Great to see you back on TG Mr Ford and great video Heat controls a bit JLR copy but not as functional
Looks like a startled FF !!!
What was the color spec of the car in the video?
That sound of the limiter is insane!
No mention you need a cable for android auto and apple car play? What else did you skip over?
It’s like they built a tall car and are doing all they can to make it into a low sports car. I don’t get it.
Basically it's a Ferrari more suited to the pothole riddled British road network.
*Понравилось советнику Москвича*
At 0:10 you hear it’s worth it
Personally , the only reason i'd take the purosangue over other SUVs would be the V12. The urus is the classic flashy SUV every rapper buys and every brokie rents. So it would be in between X5mcomp , DBX707 , Turbo GT and the purosangue.
And that’s the only time one of these things will ever be off road.  LOL
Ferrari Z3M bread van
It’s not a suv, it’s a crossover 😛😛
Ugly name, ugly looks, ridiculous price tag, but beautiful engine, can't argue with that. Never thought I'd live to see the day Ferrari succumbs to convention and builds a "sports" SUV
Watching this vieod, I thought this thing is rear wheel drive only, until you said, it supposedly is all wheel drive. In video you do not see that. Maybe it is 90% rear & 10% front then.
I just fell in love. Definitely getting one
Why have they done the dashboard to mimic what electric cars have? Haptic glass everything. Especially disappointing is the start/stop button. I know they've been doing it on the steering wheel for the last few years, which is doubly stupid. It's already a bit complicated when they first use it in the 599 with real buttons. Because the steering wheel moves. Now you're vaguely touching illuminated moving glass. And that big knob at the middle with more than one functions, a potential huge distraction.  22-23" rims kinda look cool.. if you don't mind having no room inside. Other than that I think it looks and definitely sounds fantastic. And suicide doors. That's quite a bit of a surprise. A welcome one too, I think as there's not much rear doorway space (thanks to the oversized wheels)
Yes!
Hate it!!!!!!!!!!! Like all SUVs  Over priced like almost all Euro cars
Just a comment on the Nav dropping out of signal given phone connection for Apple car play. Using Waze there is an option to download your route at the start of your journey - this resolves this issue entirely and I would urge people on holiday with limited data more generally to use this option in the app itself. No need for OEM Nav indeed!
" When you buy a Ferrari, you pay for the engine, and i will give the rest of the car free"  Enzo Ferrari
How do those auto open rear doors work when you’re parked next to other vehicles?
I love it.
Do a stig family meet up
Listen. I want one. Really bad. But I don’t have enough. Please?
It looks more like a hatchback...I love it
Of course not but I do want it more than anything in this moment. I’m normally a sleek coupe kinda guy but this has me drooling. But all cool cars have to be inflated right now so I get it. Imma stop before rant.
Will be 100% useless at any price in the U.S. when we remove all our petrol stations.
Market of idiots finally pushed even Ferrari to cave in on the suv crap - like cayenne and the rest of them, marketing exercise and a cashgrab, but if it helps them to stay afloat it must be a good thing - i guess...
Thing looks bad ass!
Got competition now, Aston, Lambo, Ferrari. It will depend on what cars will be in the garage parked next to that one 😂 Price tag ? If someone can afford 400k car, 50k more or lesser not an issue to them…
Nice corvett SUV,...looks just like a Ferrari
The Ferrari SUV priced for those who have more money than sense.
Not an SUV. Not a wagon. So Ferrari pretty much built their equivalent of a 1997-2008 Subaru Forester. Fair enough.
It's an SUV, plain and obvious. It is also twice the price of any competitor and yet no better. Not that it matters. Ferrari won't sell you one unless you already have a couple of their over-priced, rarely-driven cars in the garage anyhow. As for me, I plan to drive - actually drive - the Aston Martin DBX which is bigger, faster, and half the price while still being insanely expensive.
Hell no it’s not worth it
You didn't say how many litres has for luggage. You just put down the rear sits and that's all.
This is so stupid.
It is an SUV
hideous, stupid, expensive, and pointless.
This does look a bit interesting doesn’t it…
perfection on wheels!
Successor GTC4Lusso
Man, that haptic-touch start “button” just ruins the whole beautiful package for me. Feels like you’re starting a fancy cell phone. Yuck.
How's the steering can we adjust the steering wheel.
So it’s literally “Ford vs Ferrari”
Ferrari didn't need to do this. If you have the money to buy a Ferrari, you don't need to buy a Ferrari SUV
This would be the best medical car in F1
I still prefer the urus, but purosanguo is still a nice looking car
I actually think all cars should have advanced reliable voice control, and tactile buttons. Therefore, if the voice control breaks, you have actual buttons to press as a back up, or you have the choice. Voice control should be the future. Your hands would always be on the wheel at all times.
I love it! I want it! way out of my lifetime financial ability
"It's not an SUV. It's a FUV". Translation: It's an SUV with marketing buzzwords thrown in.
looks like a beefed up cx5
I cannot find something I don't like on this, jesus.
The ugliest Ferrari !!! 🤢🤮  Great video though 👌🏻 👍🏻
Oh dear all that fancy tech, sounds very expensive, when the Italian build quality finally kicks in. Warranty?
It really really looks like a big Mazda
Yes 100%
I'm amazed it wasn't Chris Harris driving this one.
Almost perfect! Get rid of the B pillar, replace the UI and give it to me for free and I'M SOLD!
Model X Plaid: more reliable, more useful, better tech, better performance in all conditions, 1/4 the upfront cost & even less to operate. BDE.
It's an SUV.
My wish
If you are travelling, you should download the map data for the area where you are travelling so you have it ahead of time.  You never know how your cell signal will fare when travelling in an unfamiliar area...
3:25  RIP paint after 1 summer. noted
Amazing video, I've waited forever for the Purosangue to be reviewed, I've followed the development for years. I've respected and watched you guys for years, so I'm elated that my first proper look at this was from you guys.   If no one else reviews this, I won't be sad. Very thorough. I love everything about the Purosangue down to the "half Daytona" seats.  I'd buy the "base" version for just under $500k Canadian and get 18" after market wheels all around for better tire selection and I just like even diameter wheels all around.  It's just semantics and trying to save face, it's an SUV and Ferrari did an amazing job, I just don't get the suicide rear doors. Thank you for taking it off road.
Ferrari is makin an SUV' We aint got a choice we orderin these edit: props to Ferrari for actually using a V12 and not a generic turbo v8 like in the Urus
To be honest I expected the Purosangue to be a bit bigger
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mRU3UDvhF0s
By the way it's boring
Not much
It's like Ferrari's version of an Infiniti FX50/QX70
Looks like a Chinito car.
I can buy 9 Model 3 for this price.
And try buy one if you can, even if you go with the money in you're hand tou still wouldn't be able to buy it, what a world
I think it's heinous. Good tech but a pig not a pony.
Take that over a uris any day there to comon
If one has the money and then some to afford one, and has a garage nice enough to fit one in, then why not? This is probably the best actual CAR in the world right now. What used to be the best real world car (from any category and class)? A Golf GTI Clubsport? A Golf R? Audi RS3? BMW 340i xdrive? M5? Not anymore. Purosangue must be on any rich car enthusiasts dream list.
It's ugly for a Ferrari, sorry but it really is ugly
If Ferrari is an FUV Then Lamborghini is a LUV
it bleeds power to the back*
Nice to see the top gear take on it. The engine does sound fantastic!  For the love of God some buttons and nobs are good! Very quick and easy to change/adjust things without or very little looking at them. Car manufacturers stop this insanity please. Ok, thanks! 👍
I'm not a Ferrari purist so, I love it!
I suppose this is the 21st century Ferrari, and the younger generation will no doubt love it. For me, I hail back to the 20th century  I am 60 now, and for me Ferrari was always the definitive 2 seat sports car! For me this will never change! Guess I’m of a bygone era, but you can’t help who you are and your history
The Urus is a spaceship and the Cayenne is a bit ugly....   This one though looks AWESOME!!! 😍😍😍 And a V12 too boot! 🤩🤩🤩
It's nice but it's not a Mazda 3
If Porsche, Lambo, Aston, Bentley, and Ferrari would agree to a rallycross-style SUV race series with actual race-focused versions of their SUVs, you could make these cars genetically cool to the masses, everyman and enthusiast alike.  I wish they would all stop trying to draw upon the coolness of their sports car prowess/heritage to make SUVs cool, and just give these cars a new legacy of coolness that stands on its own two feet. Let's race and crash these hambeasts, dammit.
jeez hwtever happend to proper supercars instead of this stupid suv trend for people having a mid life crisis
400k it's not nowhere near worth that much
Not Purosangue, it's not french. It's PURA SANGRE, you people need to learn to speak other languages properly! Don't be disrespectful to other people's languages! PURA SANGRE!
I paid $3500 for my CRV. I'd rather buy 100 more Hondas than one stupid Ferrari.
Ugly as sin and has no idea at all what its supposed to be. Only its V12 engine saves it from being just an overpriced turd lol
Inspired by the 365 GTB4
🤢
Ferrari said they would never make an SUV. And it seems they havent.
Why o why did they not use circular ring rear lights? I can't believe they would not have looked better. Still beautiful though..........
Hope Ferrari gets that start button improved in a future release.
Classic presenter... Love this guy, miss the long hair...
How bout we call it a "UV"
Very cool car and video! And the price in Norway is aound 500000 BP...
It's a masterpiece.
*looks over boredly at garbage covered coffee table* *knocks old food cartons off of something and picks up wad of cash* "uhg....what else am i gonna used this 400k for ............"
Please... English speakers, its not Purosanguê... Its Purosange, the U its a mute letter in latin languages like Italian.
whatever they wanna call it, it is absolutely gorgeous
Hammond was a better driver
Stopped watching car reviews but this one has the original top gear swag and enough facts to keep up happy! Loved this review
Musk laughs. Dinosaurs.
Ferrari makes a SUV? Ive lost all hope in the automotive world.
bro v12 in 2023 getting boring here the past is past
Great but no, not worth it, at least for the drivers out there.   But NOT because it cannot handle, oh no , let me explain...  The limiting factor I have always found is not the car, not the road BUT my bloody family sitting next to and behind me  complaining when I wanna have a bit of fun!  So regardless of the actual car's capability whoever is driving is screwed anyway in terms of being able to use it!  So then how can  you  actually drive like a nutter and ship the family around in style ?  Answer: For 400k go get a 296GTB and with the spare change grab a Range Rover because you will realise as I did that doing the two AT THE SAME TIME is impossible anyway!   Posing down the Kings Road? Now that's a different proposition altogether....
Surprisingly not annoying presenter. Liked.
This is just 599 X-over,or this just CX-30 Mazda copying by Ferrari?
Looks a lot like an Uris
Ferrari knocked it out the park…found another park and knocked it out of that park too🤯🔥🥹
This has to be the least "ferrari" Ferrari I've ever seen. Quite sad actually.
I wonder if this car will be the true test of ferrari reliability - since alot more people will use this as a daily driver than an F8 or something
Amazing the fact you're driving a £400,000 ferrari in the snow, let alone in decent weather. I've never sat in one, let alone driven one in the sunshine 🌞
I'm curious how different the Multimatic suspension in this is different than the Multimatic DSSV in the Corvette.
Love they used V12 but not gonna lie, should have been the turbo 8 or turbo 6. If they actually wanted to sell a ton of them. Would have literally been their #1 seller if they did that. Also a little bigger with more space in the back
The car looks huge when you're standing next to it
is it just me or is "top gear" 10x to slow to watch now
Beautiful poster car design + Ferrari badge + 4 seats + 12 cylinders = perfected heaven on earth 😍. I'll live with the first-world problem of having to download my journey in Google maps before setting off to the mountains.  So it's fair to say a reasonably optioned example would be around £350k, only £349,999.50 to go and I'm ordering mine 🤪 can't wait.
Ferrari, what did you do? You made a car I want? I like nearly everything about the Purosangue; styling, stance, aero, V12 (though you would have had me at V8) ... Other than the nit-picks mentioned in the video ... A Ferrari I would buy is astonishing.
2:24 Cameraman was looking at the car and completely lost focus :D
The future is just shit for cars
That’s a good-looking Mazda.
Damn this road looks familiar... it's the passo della Mendola and I life just at the bottom of it :)
Those haptic controls will be great in a month when they're broken and you can't even start the ridiculous thing.
Paid to be on peoples recommendeds. 3 videos as I scroll down about this car and I don't actively search for car videos.
i like the anchor.. very nice way of explaining calmly then those dancing car experts :)
Futuristic car
Rather spend 300k on this than spend the same money on a glorified Toureg. Front looks like the new Prius. And that's not a bad thing.
That walk off was cold 🥶😮‍💨
It sounds so good 😩
Top Gear's pic is way better than Auto Trader pic.
Gotta love ferrari.
I want one. Perfect for turning up at a camp site at Le Mans....
More Wookie please 👍👍
14:49 great noise....
I see a  bit of Ford Mach-E profile with this.
Rear seats settings are visible to the side!  Isn't it going back?
There will always be a Fool who is soon parted with their money.
Think Tom does a beautiful job of summing up the car and fantastic to see him on screen 👏👏
Ford puma
If I wanted off road ability I’d buy an LR Defender.  If I had £400k to go fast I wouldn’t buy an SUV.  They’re creating a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.
@Greta yep...
I want to go back to the 80's even the 90's lol.
Why in the world would you buy this all things considered over a Urus??
Completely overpriced and overrated... Next!
I dunno, it looks like a Mustang Mach-E on steroids.
shame on ferrari for going the stupid suv route just cash in more money, its a complete peace of shit car, the car looks so ugly that the devaluation with time will be HUGE on this complete shit of car
Whether you like it or not, you have to admit the design is correctly balanced. Unlike an Urus or a hideous DBX
Nice Mazda!
wait till novitec gets their hands on this
That car is beautiful…, before I thought it looked weird, but the more I look at it, especially towards the end of the video, the more I like it
Looks like a KIA
buy a used FF and save a whole load of cash.
Actually a lifted- facelifted ff
I really wanted to hate it but it seems I can't. Great review and great presenter btw!
I would rather buy the Aston Martin suv with my vast fortune....
Great vid Tom. I love that it’s a N/A V12 but other than that it does nothing for me whatsoever. Mental money and I assume they still charge you a couple of grand for Apple CarPlay?
TOO MANY ADS - unwatchable
The best car
Your phone should not lose its maps. Once it’s been loaded on doesn’t matter if you lose signal n
sounds like its got a pd popcorn limiter on it
That blue is astonishing, it looks like it has CGI lighting, the reflections on the body curves are amazing
i’m not gonna lie it’s a weird car for 400k, i would have preferred a real suv
It's really not an SUV it's an 812 with accidental height measurements.
The most beautiful suv/crossover type thing that ever exists
The front doesn’t look like a ferrari 😢
It doesn't look real 😳
She's BEAUTIFUL THAN THE LAMBORGHINI URUS
She's better than Urus
Enzo is making Italian hand gestures in his grave, rolling. Whoever was in charge of this should delete himself.
A 2.2 Tons Ferrari... (facepalm)
What a superb review.
it's just hideous.
Ferrari Utility Vehicle. Yeah, I like it 🖤🏁😎
Should be able to pick one of these up for 3k in 8 years time if it follows the trend of suv’s
What's the title and artist of the track at 16:28?
one of the most eagerly anticipated cars to be released in the past 3 years and they choose a presenter who comes across as the script writer for matt at car wow... NEXT!!
You could download the maps before you set off
Seem like a Peugeot 408
I miss jeremy..
"doesn't work".....lol
opening music????
gtc4lusso>
As a Ferrari owner, not interested in this product. I would prefer a Bentley Bentayga or RR Cullinan. Driving fast in inclement weather isn’t a priority, being sure footed is.
PATHETIC… to buy one, Ferrari would insist that you first buy a few older models before they decide whether to sell you a Purosangue.  Buy from a brand that puts the customer first.
Looks like a Kia EV6 GT
Didn't this guy used to work for the enemy?? Fifth Gear that is
a very well made review, interesting and smooth. thanks!
"comfort doors" / "welcome doors" just ferrari avoiding the correct designation. Suicide doors it's the name. It's cool. Use it.
I haven’t watched Top Gear Since Jeremy Clarkson decided he’d had enough of the BBC  It should have folded right then
400k for the wheelarches off an a3 allroad.
Levante Trofeo> Purosangue
siamo stati bravi abbastanza? 🟩⬜🟥
Remarkable video. Thank you for reminding me the old Top Gear of the nineties.
The show should of died when Jeremy and co left the show
Look not bad
This car is absolutely awesome: I dont see this as a SUV. It is NOT. It's more a hot hatchback with pure sports genes. ☺
The first suv ill buy sorry fuv))
Complicated 🤦💩😅😂
Complaining about the Sat nav.. in reality no one is going to the “mountians” and unknown roads with this
Nice FUV, really good looking! But to be honest, I'd rather pay £400k for a GTC4 Lusso, with a slightly better sound and practicality :)
400k ⁉
I WATCH YOUR VIDEOS SINCE I WAS BORN AND I'M YOUR NUMBER ONE FAN I KNOW THE FUNIESST VIDEOS
The v12 sound when it's bouncing off the limiter 😍
well you can not even buy one if you are not chosen one.....so test for general public is prety useless but yet fun to see :)
Lovely review with a good conclusion: it’s not an SUV made by Ferrari, but a Ferrari with some Utility sprinkled on top. 👍
Oh the sound!! 🎶🎵
Non hai capito un beato casso... meglio che ti metti a recensire monopattini elettrici vah
Looks ready for a cannonball record attempt
Here's hoping Koenisegg never builds an SUV!
Car for posh fat or old people who can't get in normal sports car :D
Top Gear
Whoever designed the interior with all those cool styling and functions deserves a bonus.
BORING!
URUS looks much better... This looks like a KIA!
Why does it sound like a Thai Tuk Tuk ?🤦🏻
Who is this? I WANT CLARKSON BACK!
Chubby hatchback
Imagine what those new 'glass cockpit' will look like in 30/40 years from now..!!..looking today at a magnificent F 250 LM  or Testarossa interior & cluster kept mint..compared to this..400 G's for a car that will be completely out dated and probably 'bugged out' with obsolete &  out dated computers...!!!..sounds horrible..
I think I will hold out for the Bugatti SUV.
The Launch control sounds awful though.
anything, be it car, house etc. is only worth what someone will pay for it. if you put a price tag of $1,000,000 on something but someone will only give you $500,000 for it, then that's all it's worth
OMG i loved the video the car the sharp bends but then at exactly @5:29 everything changed lol Twin Cockpit like what no
Great job Tom! 🔝
Sorry, it’s just not ‘ Ferrari’ enough.
We give you the less fashionable Tom Ford. That looks like a valets nightmare to clean, the owners of these car will never clean them personally. 😂
OK, that looks amazing...
Looks like a Kia.   And TBH not as pretty
they just created a monster. looks so stunning and gorgeous
No. Not worth 400k. Its just a ferrari
I hate that they stole the name from an anti doping group in Italy
Looks like a bit like a Kia EV6 from the front… and the back a little
Love it !!! 👌
That transmission resembles a small peniz.
It's an old FF  on steroids
Meh
IT LOOKS LIKE KIA  ! Congratulations !
Что , ты делаешь из насс,   Ferrari ???
there is one important question, how much space do you have when you park in parking lot, because the rear door opens very wide
these are going to look killer on the start line of gumball3000
It´s much prettier than the Urus, the design is spot on, also liked the fact that the engine is a V12. But I believe that Ferrari needs to change its interior philosophy, It´s not the first time that i heard automotive journalists criticism around the steering wheel buttons and other functionalities, not only on Purosangue, but also with Roma and the 296... Just put some knobs to adjust AC and volume configurations and stop with these touchscreen buttons.
This is such a pure review. None of that forced humour you see on channels such as Throttle House.
Who buys a Ferrari for its practicality?
aston, i think is more beautiful
Feels like Ferrari are playing catch up here, it’s far too small for a proper SUV and no over the air updates in a car that expensive is unforgivable. The NA V12 also seems a bit last century and a good reason to axe it if it doesn’t sell.
Like this guy. Who is he?
That new Ferrar-i Mach-e looks pretty dope!!! 😉👌🏎️🏁 8:20 Nevermind that button hiding himself on the dash was even cooler!!! 😂👌👌
They really did the buyers of this car dirty by not including the signature start engine button. Still a shadow statement saying this is not really a ferrari
Sounds like your budget povvo phone service provider is the issue, not the $400k Ferrari.
Yeah the last big manufacturer that made and SUV and tried to not call it that, I think was BMW. Remember when the E53 debuted, they insisted it was an SAV, not an SUV. Now look how well that marketing campaign worked.. 🙄
Too complicated!
Love it. Absolutely love it. Just wish it was a bit bigger.
I was skeptical about it at first, but now i have to admit that this car delivers the emotions of a “normal” Ferrari and it’s an amazing achievement for a 2.2 tons vehicle. Talking about the price, yes it is high, very high, but let’s be honest, it’s a freaking v12 Ferrari suv , you need it and you know it
This car feels too gimmicky with the electric doors and handles, two dash screens, raising knob for climate, and haptic feedback on the steering wheel
The fact that it has a V12 and not a tt V8 makes it that much more special! 🙌🏽😁
Ferrari is the best car brand in the world period
Enzo is turning in his grave.
The 6.5L V12 engine, really amazing ❤️ great work 👍
Perfect car , if there's such a thing
wheres Chris Harris ?
That engine - Rembrandt himself would be like 👍 😍
No SUV is worth 400k+ , if this had a Ford or Kia badge on people would say it’s ugly, and it is.
Who shot and edited this thing?? Focus shifting... non color matched clips... bad audio. Get better cinematographers and editors top gear. I think you have the budget to afford them.
By god. The rev limiter is just pure platinum.
Uh, a FF allroad
out of all the videos of this car. this one had the most emotion
Too weird.
Ferrari calling it a FUV is just proof that Ferrari execs are the snobbiest people on planet earth
Let's be honest, this isn't going to be touring across Europe to ski resorts in mountain snow, it's going to be going 20mph in traffic in Dubai and Shanghai.  Excellent review though.
0:22 is it just me or is the middle r in ferRari not mounted correctly?
Total masterpiece. Sorry Rest Of The World :))
Feels like such a worthless vehicle. But if I was rich I wouldn’t care, looks fun to beat the hell out of.
ooooh you are that bloke from 5th gear ages ago... where are your funny bits? shed them along with the long hair?
It is anything BUT a purebred Ferrari, a purebred Ferrari would be a race derived car. The capacitive buttons are rubish, the styling is ok, but nothing special, the price is bonkers, it sucks in more ways than can be described,  and yet, that roar amd scream of the V12 ERASES ALL THE NEGATIVES ABOUT THE CAR AND MAKES IT EPIC!!! In the world of small turbo engines, this is a unicorn!!!
So 450,000 euro give or take that can seat 4 and not 5 people as a cheap car and have to fiddle for an hour to create boot space for a luggage. Now apart from an engine that drinks a size-able pond of fuel per trip if i could afford it i dont get sat nav if i feel like switching off my phone for a little drive away from hectic life and i cant pop on the aircon or heated seat while driving as there isn’t handy buttons you can reach without taking ur eyes off the road. Who’s idea was this? Some 12 yr old kid who spends 12hrs a day glued to a phone and think its cool? I’d be ashamed to sell,something like this.
I think it would have been nice to have heard a bit more of it's V12 engine/exhaust note, since that's its distinguishing feature. However, if they put real buttons into the updated model and got rid of those bullsh!t electric door handles, only then, would I consider buying one.
Quick answer: no, because it's an "SUV"
Man this looks great! Nice take on a crossover from Ferrari
Mr. Ford, as always the very best motoring journalism. Spot on review. Crazy car, and even crazier money! Gulp! And 2 year waiting list? What?! Insane in every sense. Thank you. Excellent. ''realistic'' review.
The front end looks ugly in my opinion
Two types of people buy ferrari. Trustfund babies and old farts with bones so brittle that they can break at the first bump. So finally they have a car for half their audience.
that is a nice looking and performing SUV.
Imagine this with a novitec exhaust.
Ferrari executives have inherited the ego of the founder of Ferrari... But this thing gives me an idea of an Urus having a v12 or V10
Ferrari is so full of shit. lol
The fact that they put that raw, untouched and unfiltered Naturally Aspirated V12 Engine. Now that is unmistakably Ferraristic.
IL PUT A FERRARI BADGE IN FRONT OF MY NEW PRIUS
Purosangue with Novitec exhaust 😮😮😮😮
FUV Not SUV 😁😁😁, Classic Ferrari
Are the front and rear door arcs 100% non-interference? The colloquial “suicide door” term aside, this is the best way for passengers on one side to distribute themselves into the front and rear seats. IF there is no chance that they can accidentally hang up on each other. I’m guessing the electronic rear door actuators are there because the two doors CAN lock horns unless one of the doors isn’t governed.
The kids don't understand about what true analog experience especially from a brand like ferrari is. Surely a Lamborghini is flashy and more bang for buck but it will never be a ferrari.
It´s worth what people pay for it I guess... To me, the GTC4 Lusso wasn´t worth 300.000 euros but they did amazingly well. This successor - at 100.000 euros more for laughs and giggles - probably will do extremely well too...
looks ugly, ferrari needs some new designers.
It’s 100% an SUV. Let’s not kid around. If you took the Ferrari badge off and added a Toyota. No one would know. Those backseats are cramped also. Interior looks nice for an Audi or Mercedes. It’s not Ferrari at all to me.
Work of art 💙
Ridiculous, frivolous toy for the idle rich. Great review by an articulate, experienced driver.
Doesn't look as good as Urus/Dbx/ Cayenne
Shame not many could afford it but not necessarily because of lack of money
I'll take one
Why does it look like the new prius
If you want passion in a practical car, there's Honda Civic. :)
Looks more along the lines of a Taycan Cross Tourismo than a SUV
FUV
why does it has coarse leather
Unbelievable that Ferrari built a rear spoiler like the one on the Hyundai Ioniq 5: one that doesn't work.
At least looks miles better than the Urus!
like an RS6
You really have to see it in person to realise how good it looks
Amazing car
YES it is!!
So if i'm alone its gonna be a pain in te ass to manage touch screen on the passenger side for music and other stuff
@DailyDrivenExotics this is the Gumball vehicle you've been looking for!
It's not an SUV, it's a crossover. I lost respect for ferrari years ago, and this thing is absolutely ridiculous and not in a good way
The car doesn't make sense at all. The size, the weight, the engine choice. Seems to be an evolution of GTC4Lusso, but raised. There is probably a market for a couple of hundreds of these annually.  Ferrari will always find some nouveau riche peeps that want to buy some bragging rights. A christmas gift for Lamborghini, which probably will sell 20 Uruses for each Poursangue. Such a wasted opportunity, they could have chosen to mass produce something low CO emission, turbo/hybrid charged in order to keep the n/a 12 alive in more exclusive models.
amazing camara works
Take a shot every time the commentator says “it’s not an SUV”
Design wise - is bland, anonymous. Just like any Ferrari since 488 era. The front is dull, i understand it has to be purposeful for aero and safety reasons, but you look at it and wonder what brand it is. Yes, i know, prancing horse is kinda giveaway, but you were able to tell it´s Ferrari even without badge.
Great looking motor it's perfect in every way .just  need the spair 400 grand to buy it .great video and well.put across how the car is overall.
I like pure breed better than urus
.400k for a car?? But are people stupid? A bunch of derivative of oil, metal and other materials put it together nicely and sold to hunter-gathers fueled by money it can only end in stupidity....jezzz....no hope I'm humanity whatsoever!
Did well to find snow!
Just weird to me calling your first prancing horse ""SUV"" thoroughbred.
The answer is obviously no
Imo - Can't believe they didn't shoehorn the SF90 powertrain. V12 sounds 🔥🔥🔥
What a ridiculous car…. Would I want one….. Yes!!!
The way he shows off with this gear changing moves is ridiculous 🤦‍♂️
Nice hatchback
This review and presenter was a masterclass. I never bother to write on any reviews these days but for this one, I had to tip my hat. Bravo 👏🏻  Absolutely stunning car as well.
Ferrari Roma grown up... it's really worth it.
Not a farrari fan but I like this a lot ! 🤔😉👍🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Damn that V12 pure eargasm ... I love it, really sounds great. I wish more car manufacturers could stick to the big old V8`s and V12`s but...
FUV?? wow such creativity from the Ferrari Mob.
Why dressed like a dad that goes in the woods with the dog around one of the most expensive cars?! No style, no posture, nothing. Looks like a redneck stole this car. A 💩💩💩 society.
Sponsor one for me ia mayors
haven't watched the vid yet, but my opinion, NO its not worth 400K, but it is, so it stays special, so that not every boy with a record deal can buy one, and its so that you won't see another one in ur town! I think they made the right move with the pricing
Porsche panamera-ish
It's just an oversized FF. Lol
this car is unnesesary. stupid
If it was Ollie reviewing this thing I would be clicking on the next video.
I want to hate it.
How I wish clarkson would be the one reviewing this
The back 🔙 end 🔚 looks like a Mazda RX7
God that is a beautiful car
1:10 Bro forgot Cayenne GT and compared it to Turbo S...
W
This guy is lowkey a very good car reviewer.
Haptic 'buttons' are the bain of the modern car world. They're crap in a £30k EV and I'm sure they're crap in this too.
Love it. Now I just a a few million to own and maintain it
This car comes in at what the other super SUVs are doing, providing those who can afford ultra premium names with a car that they can use with family and their dog. This is why SUVs are outselling their siblings by large margins. There's a lot of young millionaires these days who are still raising young families, with these things they can go on a long weekend away without having to leave behind the Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bently, etc.
What a name; Tom Ford
It really is a shame that this is what came out to replace a GTC4Lusso, which was a gorgeous, gorgeous car. No matter what they call it, it will remain another unnecessary SUV.
In 2016: "We will not build a Ferrari SUV"
Imagine having 400k and spending it for this nonsense instead of buying an actual Ferrari.
Purely and simply, it's "Ferrari's version of an SUV" - they were forced to do one, as the market demanded it and they were just missing out on too much revenue by not having one in their product line.
The urus looks so much better... and they cant beat the original crossover nissan juke lol...
"Ferrari making an SUV we ain't gotta choice we ordering these" Drake
I'd rather buy the Purosangue than a Bugatti, if I were a billionaire, so let's just say that!  However, with my humble annual salary, I would never spend more for a car than my house!
the most sporty crossover ever 😀
Congrats to Ferrari, this is now my favorite SUV
The car is great and all but can I please bring your attention to this guy? His style, his speech, his delivery and his eye for details for things that viewers would wanna know is plain fantastic! The car is amazing but so was this review and the presenter. A total asset for BBC if this guys sticks around. I wanna see him take the Aventador replacement for a spin whenever that happens. Just as good as Mr. Harris.
is ugly the front ,i love the engine nothing else other than that i prefer tottaly the urus
“We gave the FF a lift, and added suicide doors” “please don’t call it a SUV”
Good car but its not look like an SUV. It is look like a Station Wagon..
i am sure it will do well, but it looks to me more like a wagon/car, i mean the height of the thing is super low it looks more car than SUV, although the Cayenne, x5m and urus, rsq8 etc are in a league below i look at them and think those are Mid Size SUVS but performance variants, this almost looks like it would compete with the a panamera turbo s, or the aston 4 door...nothing SUV about this personally....
Cool car, awfully boring review
Car looks ok, but not supercar ok. Looks like a Mazda or Alfa Romeo more than a Ferrari. Lamborghini did a great job making the Urus unmistakable supercar derived.
So basically it’s a Porsche Panamera, on stilts……. with a V12.
Grandpa-Ferrari
Very nice, very impressive. But it does rather look like a VW Scirocco crossed with a Hyundai faux-by-four.
Hell no . .its not worth it even 200 300 is huge money for a car even if ferrari or any other model
I do like Tom Ford, wish I could see him on the Top Gear programme.
Dare I say the scenery at the 4-minute mark is not really fitting neither the car, nor the channel?
Did everyone forget that the FF and GTC4Lusso existed?
lol its quicker then a porshe 911 turbo s from previous gen
Dont matter what Ferrari calls it lol, still a crossover
Wow love it.
Fantastic review! Amazing film!
Life with Ferrari a lot easier.
To me it looks really good altough I think its not a SUV but more like a hothatch.
FUV ? its a hatch back on steroids
Looks like a Mach-e and a taycan love child.
no not worth it.... its an suv djeezes
How many people are on Top Gear? I always see a new face.
@DailyDrivenExotics
I would rather get a GTC4LUSSO or an FF, somehow this new front design doesn't sit with me very well at all
No Sat Nav?...... can you imagine seeing a Ferrari drive past with a Tom-tom stuck to its windscreen?
He's done a Few Thousand Miles in it! Wow!! I was expecting journo's to get access to the Purosangue for a just few hours each, then hand to the next, then to the next etc.  I Still think a classier more luxurious way for 4 to travel, and to arrive, would be a 3.8L V8 Quattroporte Trofeo. At half the price.
We need more Tom Ford reviews!
Ferrari what are you doing, don’t like it never will👎
autoTrader review was better
Other than the daft full arm paddle shifting, really enjoyed watching this presenter's review
V12 baby😈
I love Tom, you should put him on more!
Great to see Tom Ford back. Very much missed! 👍
No car is worth 400K!!!
Well, the v12 makes this car so special and that noise …..❤
great car, looks very good.. But what is the point? Its rather faster in acceleration or in top speed as for eg. BMW M3 g80 xdrive. Go for a touring and you´ll be even better off.. Buy an M3 and a used Ferrari.....
It's a SUV.
This is the car to have in your garage
I think they should’ve used the v8. If even the SUVs are getting the v12 then it makes them less of a rarity. Just sayin…
Critic:style over substance  Me: well yeah, it’s a ferrari mate😂
Not for high guys
i bought one i need to wait 4 years
It doesn't look as good as they could have made it
Absolutely mindblowing!
Exactly the thing we needed in 2023+...#ironic off...what a waste
Murano lookalike
Very small point.  If you save offline data in Google Maps for the area you are driving in, it doesn't matter if your data signal drops, your GPS will keep you on the right course.
6:06 I call it a giant hatchback
It doesn’t come with a satellite navigation, you have to use your phone..as you mistakenly said then I think you corrected yourself
3:55 You haven’t gone fast enough mate 😏😅😅
The most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen
Worth: NO 🤷🤦
Ugly. They must put A class front design.. this design is shit
I SSSO agree on the start Button. The haptic start-stop is not nearly as satisfying as the big red button they used to put on wheels before.
A fat Roma for the new classless rich. How sad is to see the world greatest dreamcar company bending to those compromise.
The more I see it the more I like it
16.0 mins; rear wheels spinning , attempting grip and no apparent drive at the front . Not good ???
I just don’t the latest new design language of the ferrari what do you guys think?
So, who affords overly expensive cars in Europe today? I assume only pimps or drug dealers.
He was using Google maps so why not download offline maps ? Not a Ferrari issue ?
Ferrari: "Aerodynamics is good on fuel" Also Ferrari: "It's V12 is good for 190+"
Needs to be red
good one great review, whats this blokes name
It’s a shooting brake!
I recently came up with a good name for cars like this: High heel cars. Or let's say HiHe cars for short (because it sounds funny).
if u live in mountains or u drive to mountains u allways download that region to google maps offline cap. and problem solved. if your phone would lost GPS signal. The car itself would also lost it... Simple fix. Ferrari did it right.
I enjoyed this review, thanks.
Tom is a great presenter.
I don't like the idea of Ferrari building SUV. Also too expensive compared to the Cayenne Turbo GT.
So, we are not gonna make an SUV, ever, because it is not in our blood. But we will make a tall, 4 door car and call it a FUV...Brilliant, problem solved! Now, when is the Ferrari money coming, we at Ferrari did a great job to enter a niche market where the margins are huge and people just buy whatever they can?
A more comprehensive review that all the others, especially the aero!!
I don't think it's going to get my mother out of her Hyundai Kona but, it's not bad 😂
Really enjoyed Tom’s review. The best presenter you’ve had on here in a very long time.
It seems Top Gear got some exclusive version? All other british channels git the red press car.  It's hard to choose between Shmee, Harry, Top Gear and Autotrader. All released Purosangue reviews at the same time.
Guy is chatting a big bag farts
Idk if anyone else notices that this is the same location as Top Gear - The Perfect Roadtrip??? 🤔🤔
Oh man, this thing is ugly 😢
Its really not a suv, far to short
I think it looks OK , but Cant wait for Novitec to put their hands on this … once they do it ll be a veryyyy expensive car
Sold!! I'd take this over lamborghini etc.
Top gear got a blue one lol nice
I actually really liked this video, good job
Backpedaled hard on that no suv thing huh 🤣🤣
Use Google maps offline. Negates any inconvenience of losing signal.
What do you think, is it worth the price tag?
Very pretty ✅🤝
For a car that expensive, there are too many imperfections.   With many competitors that offer the same aesthetic appeal but do not have the “form over function” weaknesses, which include: no fifth seat possible, disappointing haptic Start button, odd and somewhat disfunctional settings rotary controller especially for passengers, no (updateable) SatNav which is a ridiculous choice given you have no way of navigating without phone connection.  The engine itself can’t make up for these weaknesses IMO. The car is just not “perfect” enough of a product. And simply put, it would have to be closer to being a perfect product given (1) the price, (2) expectations that come with the Ferrari name, and (3) strong competition.   Function must ALWAYS be close to perfect for a car to meet expectations in any car in my opinion. And in a Ferrari, aesthetics, luxury, and super car feel must be added to that. However, particularly in a SUV/FUV that is marketed as being a more “practice” Ferrari, the aesthetics, luxury, and super car feeling should simply not come at the cost of functionality imperfections.
Ferrari is dead, all hail to Ferrari....
Bro you lost reception on your phone not gps. Next time download the area map ahead of time so your phone/ferrari will work perfectly with no reception 👍
I like the way the journalist changes gears for millions of people to watch, not caring about the criticism at all.
A car everyone wants but no one needs from a company that said they will never build one. What a shame.
Cheesy and half sloppy with a fancy name 😂
More Tom Ford, please. Simply lovely.
Porche taycan wheels ugh
Great to see Tom back in front of the camera. He's come a long way since towing a 747 with a Touareg for 5thGear.
"This give Ferrari lovers a bit of an option" Well, thank God for that - as everyone knows that these poor souls rarely have options in their lives.  Christ, this thing is idiotic. Don't get me wrong: IMO, every SUV is idiotic. But when it comes to pure, unadulterated idiocy, this one really takes the cake. And calling it "Purosangue"? Yeah... right.
People are blind. This is hideous
@6:40 *Sitting* here. You're not speaking in the past tense!
Really love the purusangue. It’s a brilliant and beautiful car but for the money, I rather get the Porsche Cayenne turbo GT
The front is so ugly OMG, the back actually not ugly, but the part that sticks out at the front 🤮
Great review video! Haptic buttons are touch buttons with vibration or actual buttons. I think the word you're looking for is "capacitative" buttons. Buttons that function like a touchscreen. No haptic feedback at all.
Watch Harry's Garage instead. Filmed on an iPhone and way better than this BBC rubbish
Keeping the rear window clean with airflow not working? You're clearly not going fast enough!
400k is crazy its £700 worth of aluminium
400k what lira
Great cinematography
Ferrari "PuroSegway" xD
Wowwww that exhaust note is just music 🎶
3:52 ''doesn't work''  ''ch ch'' (Mafia pistols sound)
Its light aircraft & power yacht money. Super looking but...
It is not an SUV it's a Crossover
Excellent video Tom. Thank you.
So Ferrari built a Mazda Rx8?
Ferrari became a truck, just to survive. SHAME
Still very very ugly
very good job from Tom ford and ferrari...good video
I thought Ferrari said they were never, ever, ever going to do an SUV?
Prefer the Urus
Pure v12 sound🤤especially on limiter
Sorry but its too ugly
Looks great in this blue color.  It's an SAV, not meaning Sports Activity Vehicle but Supercar Activity Vehicle
cant help but look at the 2023 prius drl on a ferrari
Very good conclusion.
They should have gone 'B' pillarless, that would have made it even more awesome.
Ferrari goes suv
this guy has a whole new V12 ferrari and he started driving the car at 10 minutes, and he barley even drove it
The really big question is this - if it’s going to be “a more practical Ferrari” (as you put it) then it’s going to have to be built to do real mileage and not just an occasional few miles as a weekend toy!
do you remember when you used to laugh and see a car review at the same time? Good old times...
That sound....😍
I am pretty sure this thing whatever it is its a Fiat's idea, not Ferrari's. 🤑🤑🤑🤑
Finally a manufacturer dropping there own satnav.  Google maps is by far the best option (it should still work without signal just without live traffic)
BUY A PORSCHE!
10:50 dmo shifts
It looks like a nice Mazda...
It’s weight is comparable to the R/T Challenger.😂
I just wanted to point out that Tom Ford is an underrated presenter/journalist. I always find him nice to listen to. He has the right balance between enthousiasm and honesty. He says what lots of us car enthusiasts think, combined with lots of knowledge and facts and I really appreciate that 👌🏻 Nice car as well 🙂
The spoiler looks ugly. But remove it and voila you have an Aston Martin DBX
14:46 “this is an SUV”  Ferrari: 😡
i want to this the beautiful machine line up with a trackhawk
edited by tom "ford" pun intended
The name suggests a KIA, looks like a MAZDA MX-39 but at least it sounds & goes like a FERRARI
How stupid could be this: Put carbon fiber roof to lower center of gravity, making 5kilos LIGHTER, then put some PANORAMIC SUNROOF which ADD about TWENTY KILOS ON THE ROOF, to lift center of gravity 😂. That is what nowdays market ask: Expensive things for lobotomised and VERY stupid rich people which desperately want to look even more richer than they really are 😂
Ive just placed an order for one.        Not
Fancy Mazda 3?
Without reading the Caption! I thought it was blue 2023 'Toyota Prius'😅😅😅
Wow those wheels are horrendous..
We`ll not build SUV. Builds SUV.
That front door looks really small. Reminds me of my girlfriend's four door mini that I struggle to get in and out of. Likewise, the rotary dash control is like the mini's idrive control and touchscreen combo which I find horrible to use when on the move. Touch controls (whether screens or haptics) are terrible for using while actually driving.
"It get's prettier the more you get used to it" - That's what I told my girlfriend when she first saw me naked.
It's a bigger, fatter, slower Ferrari FF
I like this car
That’s a lot of money for a little FUV 😅
Great review by this dude.
I miss the hair.
Should of had normally opening four doors... Looks like a car trying to be a SUV, but was born two months premature. I think electric opening/closing doors are dumb and same with the screen on the passenger side lol.  The car should of been cheaper so more people can buy them so Ferrari can get more money to make better spot cars..  It looks decent, but I feel they missed the mark on this one.. again I drive a 07 Colorado so wtf do I know ha
Love this new lifted 2023 Toyota Prius. Looks fast, I hope the hybrid version saves me gas ;)
Good to see Tom Ford!
when car stand still and you want to back up, there is no wind to clear rear window...but what we know
those in ferari are really good, invent a new title for a car
No
Gets prettier the ‘more you get used to it’. For 400k I think that is a tough pill to swallow. A vehicle only really useful for two people. The Ferrari that nobody wants or will buy.
awesome.
At around 07:56 we see a piece of trim on the rear seats which seems to mimic the tie down straps in the rear of something like a 250. Either very nerdily cool, or I’m reading too much into a detail.
Looks like a Fiat or Renault 😂
This journalist looks like a drunkard. And his face is arrogant.
Expensive brick.
Ferrari really needs to get more creative with their rear light designs. They are so boring
Tom Ford... quality content.. thanks for sharing..😎
2.2 tons? Could as well be an EV.
Good lookin' front
Nope
That sound is just magical
That sound is just magical
I thought that was a Mazda. Oops!
Looks like the first generation GLA or X1 but okay
Do we think ferrari played the timing of this car well? It seems late but it may disrupt the urus as far as overally superlux SUV sales? Great video and seemingly great car. Props to those involved
Y tho?
but can you tow a trailer with it ?
Easy solution to sat nav problem , just download offline maps
Ferrari killed it with this model, it's gorgeous, but for that SF90 esque front end. I am sad to see the GTC4 Lusso go though, it was a great car.
Edit:I always know Ferrari develop really cool cars! Now i want see Purosangue by Mansory:)
The airintakes in the front shold have been the lights.. That would have fixed this cars nose.. The rest is beutiful
Seems a bit late to the party for me, 5 years ago this would have been ground breaking but now it looks like the a new Hyundai with the haptic buttons people don't like from a 2 year old Golf, at least they jammed the V12 in there to make it special though!
So... it's a bulky crossover?🤨🤔
So ugly 🤮
Is it just me or has Tesla just made most sports car 0-60s just sound run of the mill not worth mentioning as a bonus sort of thing
FUV
Where's Tom Fords - Tom Baker hair gone....and is it me this just looks like a posh Hyundai Kona. It will only be driven by ladies that have fallen on their wallet . What's the point of noisey SUVs that are destined to sit in traffic in Chelsea or the Waitrose car park.
Firstly, i think Top Gear and this presenter should get Ferrari's knob out of their mouths, then it might be an unbiased and honest review.  Secondly, if this isn't an SUV i'll be winning the lottery later on today.  Thirdly, £400k.... You are having a laugh! 🤣🤣🤣  All the high end performance manufacturers are creating SUV's that do as much maximum damage to your wallet as possible. This is almost a last hurrah before the demise of the ICE car and they'll certainly take all they can from you. Audi, BMW, Lamborghini, Porsche, all do max performance SUV's for half the price, this SUV is a proper rip-off and Ferrari think their name is worth paying double for?  Another car for proper Fools and their very deep pockets. 😐
Hmm so this car rivals the Octavia Scout and Audi Allroad? 😅
Totally overpriced
9:00 you can save maps on google maps. I do this when travelling to places when I’m unsure of the journeys signal quality
Looks like a Mazda
0:51 i don't care about Ferrari saying it's an "FUV" at all. it's an SUV, it looks like it from many angles
Waiting to see how it performs around the Nurburgring 😭
Nissan Juke
This guy just whinges about the car the whole time.
I see where Ferraris going with this car they are following BMWs front grill and styling completely lost .
👍 💙
What a machine.
A landcruiser is an SUV. This is not an SUV.
The Front is nothing more than ugly
Yes it worth money....V12 N/A SUV Ferrari and that great name,what more you need?
Sounds like a futuristic machine gun on the limiter like in starship troopers 😂
and yet, couldn't give Charles a decent car...
The Wookie is back! Finally, a proper motoring journalist is back at Top Gear with Harris Monkey. Shame he got the short straw of an SUV over a proper Ferrari.
sounds amazing but im not sure if i like the look of it
You can download offline maps for Google Maps so you have mapping when you're without signal. It's something I do when I'm going to a busy city as well because phone signals can be a bit crap in overly busy places.
I don't get the point of this car. A Ferrari FF is pretty much the same car but isn't jacked up, so the driving experience would just be better
It's all well and good the prancing horse finally realized the business value (for them obvs!) of expanding their product portfolio into the SUV market but I honestly wish the designers over at Maranello were a bit more creative with the aesthetics, this thing basically looks like an SF90 Strsdale had a growth spurt.
Ferrari SUV bad
This will be cheapest used Ferrari in 20 years. I can imagine this going for 20-30k when "suv mania" end.
Nobody's gonna mention the infamous Dotz Hanzo "axe" wheels?
Hearing a car reviewer saying "not bad" about a Ferrari, sad....
Hmm… no.
BMW take notes. This is how you do a split headlight design without it feeling like you are being punched in the eyes by a 4 armed man....
The sound ! Which extinct in this electric hybrid era ! Super rare now !!! Can’t believe we can here this
Fantastic review..
Interior looks cheap and exterior looks like every other SUV on the market
Love the snow driving and skids at the end of the Video. Tom Ford is one of the best presenters in this industry!
Awful looking car. Looks just like any SUV. Pointless.
Nowadays @Topgear team (narrators) should be learning from Hagerty professionals
Yea FUv makes sense 🥇✨
As Italian used to listen to Enzo first, and Marchionne afterwards, about Ferrari's DNA I feel sort of betrayed...i admit it's a nice car with lots of qualities...let's just stop.playing with words...it's an SUV and they shouldn't have named it PUROSANGUE...his son (Piero still alive) should have avoided that
The name of the car is a nightmare for British people…Purosanguwaaayyy
Looks like all the others…horrible
So Ferrari became stupider
Love it!
You do know you could have downloaded the whole map for the area on Google maps so you still have navigation while your phone has no signal . Remember that
The car is great but you talk to much rather then driving the machine
I have always liked Tom's car reviews.  Real-world review blended with passion and driving knowledge.  Kudos
Looks a bit dated, the front looks like a 1999 Saturn?
Repeatedly bouncing off the rev limiter in a car that is not yours. What class.
400k for a SUV ? 😅😦
Really cool that they made vents look like headlights. Basically the face of the car isn’t actually the lights. New dream car for sure
The only gripe I had is that, it doesn't look Ferrari enough. Looks more like a Maserati.
Tom Ford Purosangue 👌
Saleproof!  Looks like a Nissan Murano.  Enzo is rolling over in his grave.
That jusst looks like a Model Y coming towards you... Ugly.
Great car  Weirdly small though, especially compared to a urus/cayenne turbo/rr svr   Won’t stop it selling like crazy though
Don’t like the actual car, but good on them for producing another NA engine - I thought we wouldn’t get many more of them in my lifetime.
Ford reviewing Ferrari
Who stole from who on that back end, KIA or Ferrari?
At least they put the right engine in 😍
Not an suv or cuv, an fuv?? lol Leave it to Ferrari to create their own utility name. We all know what it is. It would look so much better with a much thicker tire to take care of that "huge" panel gap. $400k though? Nope! I have the money and there are much better options on the current market for a vehicle like this. Ferrari... get your heads out of the clouds.!
"I'm quite tall" so how tall is that? 1,75m? 1,80m? 1,85m? What information is that? Do you also say "it's quite fast" and quite wide? FAIL
The new Chrysler PT cruiser?
Maybe it's a great car, but it's not a daily, with unreliable v12 , and if it's not a daily car, all this  ,, practicality " basically useless.
Beautiful
Not for me id better chose 707 AM
Who designed the middle console 🤮
Hands in the pockets, visible reflection and shadows from the cameramen, staining the floor mats, leaving the false floor on the damp ground below and shifting gears like a teenager. I gotta say Top Gear has gone down hard on its production. Either BBC has cut funding dramatically or we're seeing the actual downfall of a giant. Either way, more power to us independent creators!
the bloody effin' haptic "buttons" need to disappear once and for all, nobody asked for them in the first place..
This is definitely a FUV. F#ck you vehicle, that is.
Looks like kia electric
Looks like a Mazda
Not a very good SUV!
What an ugly SUV. The Ferrari name if further tainted
Awaited review... It a Ferrari✌
Ferrari has already sold all production of the Purosangue for the next two years, that's all
In this day and age you can identify yourself as whatever the F you want. So if Ferrari identifies this as NOT and SUV we just have to accept that. And never call this an SUV 🤌🤣
I'd still take a gt4clusso
Reminds me of a jacked up GTC4 Lusso
Your phone losing signal is not a Ferrari problem just saying
Ferrari Purosangue DRIVEN ( at 10:15 )
I never liked ferraris but the fact that they did not just go with the trend completely, makes me want to add a roma in my collection
In this "practical car" can you open the rear suicide doors with the front doors closed?
"It's a Ferrari Utility Vehicle" -sounds like something a car company would say if half their revenue came from merchandising (not actual cars)  🤣🤣🤣
Not worth it! I would still buy an urus
🇮🇳🇮🇳🙏🙏👍👍
almost double the time of the aston martin valkyrie from Chris Harris. really wished that got a longer feature.
THAT THING IS FIRE
The Ferrari Kona
Sound: 10/10. Looks:  3/10.
Ferrari Roma on steroid
That UI completely demolished all other vehicles in this segment. It’s been my biggest gripe with the DBX and Urus.
Forgive them Enzo, they don't know what they do.
New Petrol Cars like these will make electric cars obsolete! Noise, speed, looks! Keep em coming Ferrari, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Lambo and many more ...
Ferrari made a Golf!
Has got no other name easier to pronounce
I miss the keys to start a car. Hope car companies read this. Like if you agree.
This and the Lamborghini Urus are two of the ugliest cars ever made, no matter how fast they might be.
An F U Vehicle.
This is the best review (seen Harry,Rory and tims) covered all the bases and then some👍
This is easily the best SUV and most beautiful Ive ever seen.
The Urus is 80% a twin-turbo V8 Volkswagen SUV and 20% Lambo, this is 100% Ferrari
Think GTC4 Lusso on stilts.
it looks like a chinese ev
I can’t believe you didn’t show what the thing in the central console that looks like a geared shifter is. I honestly did not enjoy this review at all. Such an interesting car but WHAT A BORING REVIEW
anyone knows the matching yacht for this ?
But can you put a ski rack on it?
As Drake said Ferrari is makin’ an SUV, we ain’t got no choice, we orderin’ these.
Never has a car looked so pointless. F..U..V... indeed.
Of course, it's just what the manufacturers think they can get away with, whilst laughing into their latte's in the dealership.
Those black wheel arches are just hideous
I'm blown away, not only by this car but by the host as well, good job
These rear door windows make the rear of the car feel like Kia Ceed 2 door firm 2008 - no view out.  Also, I do not know why, but whole dashboard design and amount of interior space reminds me of 2020 Fiat Tipo hatchback.   I would like if somebody would compare Tipo with this car, and apart from V12, they are identical.
So... Formentor on steroids in case of dimensions? :D
Standard...anyway ..
Ferrari’s look great in blue, it’s a shame every one is always done in red
The front is so hideously ugly
that thing is so ugly
Seems an expensive attempt to (not) catch a Model X Plaid. It's pretty, I like it. There's a couple of years window for something like this. Hope they sell a few.
blue ferrari suv. clown joke
thanks ferrari for not making your first ever fuv a hybrid
Not nearly as good looking as the GTC4 Lusso
Cannot wait for this one in Forza Horizon 5's next update! Perfect Forza Horizon car, 4WD, handling, ground clearance and a great sound!
It's a crossover
The GTC 4 LUSSO has evolved❤all grown up❤❤a bit💷💷😍😋😋💷💷💷
Jeremy Clarkson needs a voice over to complete this review properly
Dude, what a boring review for such an exciting car
I'm sure I'm not the only one but this Ferrari is actually growing on me 👌🏼
Never heard of downloading a map 8:50
Good looking, great engine, but wow Ferrari is TERRIBLE at interiors these days
All these car companies unloading all their gas car creations before the EV age comes 😆
Another masterpiece from Maranello.
Bro I'm not lying I thought it was the Lamborghini from the thumbnail
Will it drive 200,000 miles?😅
Imagine you buy a car for 400 K and then you need another device to navigate!
this is going to cost so much to maintain
The world needs ditch diggers too
G80 will smoke that
What a video. The cinematography. Autotrader’s and Henry Catchpole’s videos on this are amazing as well. The combination between nature scene and the Ferrari. Damnnnnn
Very difficult car to dislike.
Bro the limiter at the end just 😘👌
You can't review a ferrari like would review a fiesta.
This isnt a Ferrari. Ferraris arent supposed to be daily drivable. Also watch this become the highest selling car made by Ferrari.
The new prius looks great!
It looks just like the Ford Mustang Mach-E.
A crossover Ferrari for soccer moms. I don't care how much horsepower it has, there's only one word to describe it; LAME.
By far the prettiest SUV on the market!
Thank you it makes perfect sense,  a car you want but don't need and sound brilliant.
I'm ordering
The elite get a Ferrari Purosangue while Greta Thunberg and Klaus Schwab take away our Demons, Corvetts, and TRX Rams. When is Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, or Rolls Royce going total EV?
it's like a modernized 456 wagon! it's great to see ferrari try something new, they clearly know what they're doing but sometimes get caught up in adhering to their traditions rather than innovating
Look like a upgraded Prius 😂
Top gear not wanting to offend Ferrari, but so much better and better value options out there
It's as ugly as a Prius 2 see😔
Urus is 3.2 seconds 0-60
715hp Mazda CX-30 dupe. Should've lifted a Roma.
I'd rather have the Bentley or Roll Royce for that price but who am I kidding, I'll never be behind the wheel of any of them
This really smokes the Lamborghini. The Lamborghini went wrong with putting a V8 in the Urus. Ferrari fixed this w/ the V12… wow
It’s an uglier Lusso. Congrats
Beautiful car! I reckon if they dropped it on its guts it would be a runner for the Hot Hatch of the year!
My kids and I were at the dealership and we saw this thing get dropped off for the first time about 2 years ago
FUV (translated into Ferrari)- a F*ckYouV
It's a hatchback. A super hatch.....with a v12! 🤤
Ford VS Ferrari
Ugly
you want a button to press? thats a bit new school isnt it? wouldn't you prefer to hand crank it like the good old days
yeah....uh...tetris, not jenga in my opinion for the biggest hatchback advantage
Solution losing GPS signal.   CACHE YOUR MAP DATA!
soo Ferrari has still not made an suv what a shame😂😂😂
Great review, I want it now even more than I did before. Great to see Tom on camera, more reviews from him please.
Ugly. Plus, Chris harris is not in this epi.
Very against having Ferrari have an FUV. I wish they were bold enough to say that we don’t care that we could increase sales 500% but we will not make an SUV. But they succumbed to pressure like anyone else😢
Hey Ferrari, it’s an SUV
For.$400k I think I'd rather have an Urus Performante with all the options tbh.
I wish Ferrari still made beautiful cars instead of nerdy ones.
Can't wait for influencers to buy these and slam them to the ground.
Ironically the clarkson curse lives on. When the F1 team is shit, the car division puts out a genuinely good vehicle. You may dislike the form factor, but cuvs can be fun.
Rick
Wow top gear, thanks for giving us back to back 2 great reviews.
The car is fantastic and the presenter is awesome.
I cant be the only one who thinks this is one of the worst looking vehicles of the whole SUV craze. Its like ferrari took notes on the new chevy blazer and somehow made it worse.
Change the other guy, bring this one more! Such a difference.
Ahhh yes,  exactly how 99.99% of the people who own one of these will drive it.
Top gear have declined now. This review is boring
I don’t love it purely for the story of how they got the name.
it's big hot hatch.
Is this more the size of a porsche Macon?
Just shows hpow far up themselves ferrari are.
Looks like an RX8 mixed with a Mazda 3
should've given it to chris
Looks like the mazda mx5 🤣🤣
You just download offline maps before your journey. How don’t you know this. You can since 2014
It's just a 2+2
Wow it's heinous looking. Money can't buy taste.
I think it’s gorgeous. Loved it at first sight
I still prefer the Lamborghini Urus.
This is for a Dad that wants a v12 or someone that wants a ferrari but cant have a low car. Any other person i feel would just buy the car.
Brilliant review Tom !!!
It's not good looking
A lifted FF
I hate the plastic looking wheel wells. It reminds me of the new WRX and they didn't get a pass.
Mazda mx 30
BURN IT. Burn every Ferrari until they win a championship. Period.
If a jeep cherokee an ferrari had a kid this would be it.
Seriously... good luck trying to get in that back seat when you are parked up alongside some other car.
Imagine this vid with Jeremy Clarkson ah the dreams that could have been
But can it pill a trailer?
Those wheel arches look really wrong.
Ferrari crossover... Not SUV.
What a beast of car " Instant Classic"
Don't want to rain on anyone's parade but for the money they want for this thing, it's a testament to the stupidity and crassness of the wealthy class that they will buy it. The plasticky black painted wheel arches demonstrate the absolute lack of creativity by Ferrari that they resort to such a cheap (both literally and figuratively) effort by their designers to make this thing look somewhat less chunky and ugly. F for effort. What Ferrari should have done was to stop acting embarrassed for building an SUV and actually built a world beating SUV, which was both big and sporty, that you could fit 5 easily with a shit ton of luggage to separate oneself from the trophy wives driving range rovers. Maybe than all this money they want for it could actually be justified.  PS the two screen solution is idiotic if the passenger can't be locked out. It's so distracting when a passenger even plays with air conditioning, having a second screen, this would be unbearable.
Ferrari says it's an FUV.  Yes, it's an F U vehicle.
How absolutely amazing would this thing be if it had a 6 speed manual?
looks like a toyota
ferrari saw those pics of the urus towing the lambo and the q5 towing a r8 and finally brought something to the party love to see it
This guy is great.  Best guy on TG after Chris by far.   I can't even remember where he used to be, maybe Fifth Gear?   Haven't seen him in years but he deserves to be on the front with CH.
Seems as good as you could possibly hope an SUV to be, but seeing that Ferrari badge on it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth
This then is the ultimate example of misinterpreting the meaning of a sports car. Overweight (2.2 tons!!!), over luxurious, overpowered and catered not to the enthusiasts but for the completely vain and utterly confused.
This video is boring compare with the topgear cross turismo video
Did ferrari make a crossover??
What's the point of having suicide doors is the B pillar is still in the way?
All the other competitors use a base from a cheap car, that’s the difference. An urus is really a VW atlas underneath sadly. This is special.
the blue 0-0
Haptic, that word.  You keep using it.  I don't think if means what you think it means.  (it is actually the opposite of what you think it means)
Not that I'm their demographic, but they lost me at the start button or lack thereof.
Has the new Prius front end so that's  unfortunate. I'm sure it's great and those that buy it will love it.    Let's be honest this was done for the same reason Porsche made the Cayenne and the Macan. So if this keeps Ferrari in the black so it can keep making actual fun cars then so be it.
Love this! Would buy it in a heartbeat if I could
The fact that companies continue to make ICE cars at a point when the earth is approaching the point of no return with respect to climate change, is totally astounding to me.  It's madness.  These companies need to be shut down, hard, for all our sakes.
this car does look like a painting or not? on camera and in person, it's a true game changer on design.
No tks
Not quite as ugly as a DBX, but that's not a pretty vehicle.
This car is a work of art, so majestic, it's almost a different shape every time you see it
its not pronouced sangWAY, the U is silent, SanGAY, Puro Sangue!!
Blue 🔵🔥
This new body style called "Shooting brake/SUV coupe crossover" 😂
Looks like an expensive Mazda 3
Rip top gear giving real critique
Ferrari hit the point. Really amazing look and thanks for the natural V12.
It's an X4 size
Top Gear was about calling cars and people stupid.
Yuk! Top gear SUCKS ASS now
Once you see the mazda hatch you can't unsee it.
I wouldn’t call myself an environmentalist but seriously, Alcantara made from recycled bottles, no sat nav, a tight interior, aerodynamic styling trinkets, it’s not an SUV when it clearly is, with the very latest in last century internal combustion! If this isn’t a case of “The Emperors New Clothes” I don’t know what is! If this was any other manufacturer it would completely panned!
As a Ferrari fan I was opposed to the idea of Ferrari making an SUV/Crossover at first but Ferrari really did such an amazing job on the design and the overall package that I absolutely love it now. The Purosangue is fantastic. Looks great, sounds great, has plenty of power and luxury + quite practical too. What's not love?
It'll depreciate like a rock
google maps on an Android phone will let you download maps for offline use. You select the region to download.
I like the swastika wheels. It's a nice nod to the name and their Italian past.
Y’all remember the show killer bean an his car
*_Dear Lord THAT THING IS UNGODLY UGLY!!_* 🤢🤮 *_Does it realy come for Italy!?_* 🤔😳
Nissan Juke?
More like new age high ground clearance version of GTC4 lusso nothing special
Purosangue?  Sounds like a city in North Korea.  Nice car with a really stupid name!
This is definitely a beautiful vehicle that Ferrari has created regardless of what they want to call it
What a ugly car
THIS makes me so happy. I worked on the project as a vehicle dev. engineer (oh, the endless nights testing this thing!) and grew up in THESE exact mountains. Seeing the shots of a car that I spent time on, and in my beloved mountains around Madonna di Campiglio... I'm just so happy. What a great accomplishment this car is. in every single way.
It’s absolutely stunning
Why are Ferraris so ugly? Looks like a clown shoe 👞
Didn’t Ferrari sue a damn charity to get the rights for the purosangue name? All just to make an ugly suv that they said they wouldn’t make in the first place…. Typical Ferrari 😂
Nah,this grazed the mark for me. Too basic. Has absolutely nothing on the urus, which is who they should be aiming to beat, not say an X5. This looks like a W in a competition with an X5 type thing
Reminds me of a Subaru Crosstrek
Just awesome.
is it me or does the front end look like the porsche gt2 rs ??
It is only familiar in the Manzoni era. Terrible review. And Tom Ford is just meh. Actually truly awful in evert respect. F'ing Useless Vehicle.
Surely delighted to see an SUV from ferrari.  But calling an “SUV” an “FUV” is a bit of an overkill. I mean come on Ferrari, you should have thought before making that comment years back based on just ego. 🙂
Stop lying...its an suv
Triple F watching this and ordering one as we speak haha
Why did they make it so ugly
So its bad as an SUV and not as good as a normal ferrari.  And its called pure blood.  Huh Seems ferrari made a tall hatch back.
sidewall on this tires looks way to thin.
Cool seeing this much functional aero on an suv
Ferrari is the only brand that can get away naming their car “Eugenics” in 2023
Hmm, it looks like chopped and pumped up pininfarina rather than Ferrari🤔
I think it looks rather fantastic. I've got 2 kids, so this would be the perfect family hauler.
Gtc kiddo lusso
I kinda like it tbh. Can’t wait till Alex from Gintani gets ahold of one of these. RDB will get one first.
With cars like these, spec is everything. So I wouldn’t fault an owner for adding 100k in options. Especially when the quality of work is that good. It’s not like the car will depreciate in value. It has an N’A V12 for heaven’s sake
That front end is a 2023 Toyota Prius for a fraction of the price!  Toyota is on point with its design language @FrankStephensondesign !!
Let's call it what it is, a hideous crossover with a mouth watering engine and it's going to outsell every Ferrari combined  and then some.
Ridiculous overpriced overstyled cliche
Good car but at what point do cars become so expensive you don't wanna drive them anymore? I get a million dollar hypercar that gets taken out a few times a year, but a 400k SUV that should be used daily or nearly daily is silly. Even if you have the money to use it everyday, you'd still worry a bit about having it dented, scratched, etc.
this was a really good review - just seen Harry's garage review of same car, and that was flat, boring and uninformative.  Good job!
Never did I ever think that the new Prius looks better than the new Ferrari..
Ferrari sold out a long time ago
Ferrari Sport Utility Vehicle (FSUV). There you go, its not an SUV.  No rear window wiper? When you talk about some dork trying to be clever for the sake of being clever and thinking his shit doesnt stink... that's a great example. Probably the same guy who designed the 296's user interface.
Honestly? I think it's one of the greatest cars ever made (at least on paper) lol. I despite the recent trend of SUVs - but I also despise the recent trend of poorly packaged 2+2 cars passing as grand tourers. To me, this is perfect. It's on the larger side - but yet it's on the smaller end of 'the larger side'. It also apparently weighs less than most modern luxury saloons (or even much less than a Bentley Contintental GT - which is a GT coupe). It remains exotic with a naturally aspirated V12 (seriously, no one else can say the same), and it just looks right.   I agree with Ferrari. This is an FUV. I'm not sure if it's really anymore practical than the GTC4Lusso - but it manages to just not cross that line of being too big or too heavy - and that's something that every other manufacturer gets completely wrong.  My only gripe (which is admittedly something that i think ruins the car by a LOT) is the stupid haptic touch buttons on the interior.
At a glance I thought it was the Mach-e
The FF is so much better.
Best loooking suv
I'm just sick of SUVs.
Its everything the FF was trying to be.
It's very ugly and the people who buy it are very stupid. Your wives want a proper car too, you tasteless gits!!
it’s definitely an FU…
Looks like a raised RX-8
Not DRIVEN I expected from TOP GEAR
You can always just buy a real Ferrari and a Jeep Grand Cherokee for the snow.
1:47 ... same footage we can see in Henry Catchpole video about the same car, but number plates are different. How can it be?   In all other aspects,Top Gear, You did exellent job.
Ferrari made an SUV. Thanks a lot...
offline maps with Google Maps has been a thing for ages. but i do agree its nice to have even a crappy GPS system as a back-up.
It always bewilders me when English people put on an accent when they say a foreign word 🤣       Im no so sure there are people in Italy that pronounce pie and mash with a cockney accent.
Much better than Urus
Appreciate the truth style run down on it.  Some of those features I can see in the future they becoming an issue that only time and usage can uncover. I'm sure maybe they'll be another take on it when it has some time in owners hands and on the road. Let's see..
That is one ugly thing! HAHA. Just terrible. They will sell well in Miami.
Please bring back the GTC4 Lusso
Tbh the headlights look like the new Prius
to me it looks more like a crossover, sorry a ferrossover
very good presentator.
not bad. a bit expensive though
WHAT'S UP WITH THE DOTZ HANZO WHEELS??
I started to type a whole of things I didn’t like about the job this “ journalist “ did , I deleted it to just say……..  I miss CLARKSON 😢.
Is this the guy that Jeremy Clarkson punched 😂
Cool machine. It's sad that Ferrari is a garbage company.
Between the name and the imaginary "FUV" form factor, Ferrari is trying way too hard to convince people that they are not diluting their brand with it.  More so than any other sports or luxury marque that has decided to take advantage of US chicken tax.
8:30 in re: no native satnav - it's on the driver to make sure when they're going to go touring someplace new, they download maps offline within their main mapping app (e.g google maps etc).  It's been a feature for almost a decade. I rely on it whenever I'm anywhere new and even slightly rural.
That’s the new Hyundai Kona
those wheels are horrible...stop the 2 tone
It's won me over... but at the same time, I would've been totally fine with an updated GT4C Lusso (lights and whatnot).
I think this is the most Enzo Ferrari car Ferrari made in years. He would have loved it
What's the name of that 20,000 paint you mention? I wanna make sure I add it on mine, thanks
RIP Ferrari. 1947-2023.
it's worth the price based on that screaming v12 alone 😍😍
Remember that Ferrari sued a Charity Org Purosangue Foundation just for the name?  Yea
Wayyyy toooo looong for showing the details
Saw one in person at a party at the Ferrari dealership in Austin ahead of the US GP. Gorgeous.
That infotainment design is so… Italian 😢
Ferrari and Pininfarina should never have broken up. Their cars just aren’t the same without them. The only current Ferrari that really looks properly exciting and bonkers is the Monza SP3, which is a $2 million hypercar, so it has to look bonkers. The 812 looks too fussy and boring simultaneously, the F8 looks like a blob, the Portofino looks dull, the Roma looks like an Aston Martin, the GTC4 is just a long 812, and this looks like a Nissan crossover.
“It’s not an SUV, it’s an FUV”    …    What?🧍🏻‍♂️
Woah, Tom Ford has changed a bit !!!
The only sporty v12 SUV on the market ?... Thats the only reason to o7 would buy this....
Is too small for it to be an SUV, ferrari can try to call it what it wants but a crap is a crap no matter how you dress it up. This is something you can use as a daily for work, run errands and the occasional weekend trip.
kinda looks like the kia ev6 lol
I couldn’t want a Ferrari any less than I do right now.
Cool? Yes. $400,000 cool… nope
a lifted FF - not original
FUV just call it a cross over no harm. but really if no issue with money this is a proper ferrari GT you could cross continets further than 812 can as it has more ground clearance than other GTs. now tehr question is this or audi rs6 or bmw m3 touring hhhhhmmmm
Sorry Ferrari- it's an SUV
That Engine by itself makes this model a proper Ferrari.
FF/Gt4 Lusso Reimagined.
Now, rich ladies can shit on less rich ladies that drive porsche suvs.
Far out it is ugly
A practical Ferrari, who would have thunk.  I want me one of these...And a Porche Dakar.
if you dont want to get sued by Ferrari, you dont wanna call it SUV man.
Looks like a Kia/Hyundai
the only Ferrari that looks cheap
It’s way too expensive
How has the man who ruined 5th gear ended up on T&?
Denying to call it a SUV is ferrari being childish + ego LOL…🤣🤣🤣🤣  Or anything to justify their claim?😂
Anyone buying a modern day Ferrari doesn’t give two shit about performance or class. They are the same people that would pay 500k for a Hyundai ioniq with a horse emblem and stitched leather
still SUV
I do love it, but is it just me or does it look like the love child of an SF90 and a Mustang Mach E? It sure does work tho!
Wookie is back!
It’s unlike anything we’ve seen from Ferrari but everything we’ve seen from Hyundai and Lamborghini 😂😂😂 Ferrari stopped giving a shit about bring number one in anything outside of F1 a decade ago
this seems to be more subaru outback than wrangler or bronco.
"Purosangue" What a STUPID name for a car!
I wish there was an SUV racing series that would be interesting to watch
Impressive SUV. The prancing horse in the grille could be considerably larger. Same at the rear.
The problem with this video is that all they have done is cheaply knock off the designs of four other auto makers and hope their audiences are too fuvking stupid to notice anything but the over rated badge
would love to see a ferrari that will rival panamera and rapide and gt4 amg
they are going to sell a LOT of these.
sucha cool looking car even in that blue been a ferrari lover since childhood
I hope it's not an SUV because I like it.
What a Purosangue is, is cash grab after seeing Urus do so well.
With the position of the headlights I would certainly believe that they are not competing against Urus nor DBX or Bentayga but most likely against Kia Hyundai Citroen and Renault. 🤦🏽‍♂️
rari is finally modernizing
I can't help myself.. That car is really beautiful looking, especially in this color!
Beautiful car! The FF is just a distant memory now ;-)
Most boring Top Gear video I’ve ever seen.
now I forget  about all the cayennes ,urus,x5x6M,DBX..GLE AMGs..this ferrari is just on its own class & the v12 just makes it special nice job ferrari!!
great review wookie, would love to see some more reviews from u
As a top gear fellow, you should know the difference between 4 wheel drive which is shown as 4x4 on a vehicle and All Wheel Drive which is AWD. It’s. A big difference. Most SUV and some cars now are AWD. Did you notice how power was delivered differently on the 4 corners while driving in the snow and that’s the AWD being in action driven by sensors and computer to properly apply power to individual wheels for best traction possible.
400k for SUV ? Never, nooooooooooo way.
Very expensive for a station wagon
Definitely a F U Vehicle
Bro doesn’t know that he can download maps on a phone to use offline 💀
This is a first gen fuv, I’d definitely wait for a second gen
The front looks like a new Yamaha r1 in car form lol
Disgusting
is there a better country than Italy? its sceneries, its food, its people, its culture, its art, its language and....its cars
They must be proud. First time in history they made a Ferrari that you can actually drive outside podiume lol... All of those exotic car nonsense makes me laugh
Thought it was the new Toyota crown 😂
That blue paint color is pretty cool
Great video host is great as always but that car is just "meh".
FUV 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 imagine the old dudes “you’re most incorrect child, Ferrari would never make an SUV, this here is a Ferrari Utility Vehicle”
Great, the RX-8 is back on the market.
Sit on the limiter while in negative cold weather lol
מדהים לחלוטין!
If Urus gets sales I do not see why this one won't sell like crazy too.
It’s awesome to see Tom Ford reviewing cars on Top Gear again. I have fond memories of him as a presenter on Fifth Gear, including his review of the Maybach when it was new and the elaborate process of customizing one.
And then there's u with an electric and u r vegan and u have no pron*un.
I haven’t watched much yet but this looks like one of those “dress shoes” that’s supposed to fit and feel like a tennis shoe but kinda fails at both.
400k for a glorified SUV that resembles a toyota crown lol
Pretty sure Cayenne turbo GT spanks it
💙🏁💙🏁💙🏁💙🏁💙🏁🏁💙🏁💙🏁
looks amazing
Why do I get the sinking feeling that a Kia will start to look like this in 5 years
that na v12 is carrying it hard tbh
OMG I´m in loveeeee!
So it’s like those new Lambo and Porsche Safari type cars but with extra seats. I’ll admit I really do like it though and it has quite possibly the best name ever.
The competition looks boring compared to this
But does it have ISOFIX?
Wow, it's been years since I watched Top Gear; what has it become.....
If Ferrari focused more on Formula 1 rather than coming up with stupid names to call their SUV, they would be winning championships.
I like the new Prius front.
I thought they were going to use the 3.9 litre V8. The fact that they jammed the V12 in there is just classic Ferrari. Fantastic.
Now all we need is a showdown between all the supercar manufacturer SUVs to see what's what
Imagine rolling up in this to a Ferrari club meeting
Ha! FUv! That’s kind of clever. It’s probably gonna sell a lot of Priora.
ferrari caved long before any of the other brands even sketched up an SUV, let's be real
Had a Mercedes GLA 250 in south seas blue that looked identical, even had a white interior
It looks like shit, and Ferrari sold their soul, like the rest of the legends...
Looks like a KIA
Wether it's worth 400K is now irrelevant.. they've sold out, Ferrari won't be taking further orders, and won't be producing any more than it has.
What a sad car. The FF was more true to the Ferrari character but people didn’t get it so they made it uglier on purpose to sell more. Like all SUVs it looks cheaper while being more expensive.  I will never get what people see in these things.
Right now its a best car in a world. And ferrari ev get the same suspension
Looks lika an ev6 together with a dbx
It's not an SUV 🙄
It looks like common chinese electric car
Ferrari calling it's SUV "pure blood" is a joke on it's own, just like this "review"...
They left out the round tail lights otherwise what a beauty
Loving that blue
Not a fan, a chunk of Ferrari's DNA was lost with this one.
debadge it and it looks like a mazda 3.
Ugly
$50 Tom Tom, problem solved
At some point I saw a Renault Cleo
If I wanted a car with those headlights, I would simply get the new Prius. Now that’s not knocking on the Ferrari, but it certainly is a hand to the Prius and it is at least mildly amusing they they’re comparably shaped.
Imho this looks weird.. it doesn't look ferrari. It looks like a cross between a luxury italian brand and some chinese EV company. But of course to each their own.
Great video, Tom is the man.
So a crossover. And we know how much those worked out
Really enjoyed this guy’s review. Naturalistic on camera, honest, not trying to be too funny… Good stuff
5:00 pause… so you have to hold the button to close the rear door or?
It's like a Ferrari take on the Ioniq 5/EV6 - a hatchback, but massive. I don't hate it, but I still don't really get why being higher up is better for anyone whose hips work, the GT4C makes much more sense. The GT4C doesn't have stupid touch buttons on the wheel either, so...well realistically I'm never going to buy either anyway, but then neither are 99.999% of other people watching/commenting, I'm just never going to fantasise about buying one of these either.
I'll take them Lambo, thanks
I actually really like how the Purosangue looks. It just looks more elegant and less fussy than the Urus.
ugly as shit,they should have kept their word and stayed away from SUV like they said.
Toyota stole that design and give us the new Prius🤣
I think this is a great report, video, the vehicle looks awesome!!! Seeing the car made me wonder what a Ferrari version of not a Ford Raptor style pickup would look like if this is suppose to not be an SUV style vehicle? 😁
im sorry but that redline sounds so ugly
I am going to stereotype every person who buys one of these as being the antithesis of a car enthusiast.
What a stupid thing. I will never understand the obsession with fast SUVs.  Just get an estate car and a decent sports car for the weekends.
Seems fine, but it's hard to see what this does better than a GTC4 Lusso other than have a couple inches more ground clearance.
Worst Ferrari I've seen in my life
That’s gonna sound real good with a proper exhaust
I can't stop thinking about James May when I listen to him speaking... Does anyone else feel the same?
Enzo will be Krueger and come to kill all Ferrari Team.
*Checks couch money* Nope. Not today. Maybe next week.
I don't own a Ferrari but I own their stocks and these FUVs are gonna rocketship the share price to the moooon!
Eff You Vee? Sigh.
SUV, FUV… whatever they call it, this thing is beautiful. Ferrari came in to shake up the market!
Utter Heresy and killing of a ledendary brand. Enzo would be spinning in his grave knowing this exists.
Side profile reminds me of a lifted GTC4 Lusso/FF, I dig it.
I think this will be Ferrari's best selling car ever just like the Urus is for Lambo.  I always thought the Urus was ugly.  This is gorgeous.  They will be all over LA. It will be the IT car every rich person wants.
Regarding the "no sat nav" situation, I agree with Ferrari on that one:  nothing they come out with will ever be as good as an up-to-date iOS or Android device.  But really wish the map apps would pre-emptively cache the data on its own when it knows you're not local.
How do you say Chelsea Tractor in Italian?
Wow, Tom, haven't seen you in ages. It's a shame because you're so nicely on the subject, so well spoken... Really an honest pleasure to listen to. Thank you for the review!
Sorry Ferrari but this one doesn't look good at all  :S They should just do a raised GTC4Lusso
It's like an engorged shooting brake
At first I didn't like the Purosangue. However by now I really appreciate it. Naturally aspirated V12, roomy interior in a Ferrari, a trunk and special looks to set it apart from all other SUVs? That's a win. The Urus and Benteyga are just big Q8s/Touaregs, this is really special. I couldn't choose between the Purosangue and the DBX, luckily (or sadly) I'm not in that position anyway xD  Another thing is, that Ferrari didn't have to make an SUV, they made enough profit anyway. They just did it because they wanted to. They just said to themselves "what would the best SUV possible look like?" and developed this.
I'm ok with idiots buying this, driving it around and letting me listen to it.
How did your parents name you Tom Ford? That’s dope lol.
Tom Ford 😂 or was that just me
That blue is beautiful 😍
Since when did this guy go from fifth gear to top gear
Worth 400k? Of course not. Faster than the competition? Of course not. Yep, it's definitely a Ferrari
The irony of a man called Ford reviewing a Ferrari
Basically it's a Ferrari hot hatchback 😁
The best suv ever made!!
god that thing sounds fantastic
Good seeing you Tom. Nominative determinism holds true. Cheers.
Looks exactly like the lotus one
Nice video. Hunk of junk vehicle.
Not Chris. Over to Catchpole, Metcalf and Sutcliffe on the other channels
The wheels look too small despite being 23 inches.
Expected
So much for Ferrari years ago saying they weren't interested in electric or SUVs!!
Goofy ahh Ferrari
I shouldn't like it, the styling is absolutely bob on if you really must make a SUV
This trend of heavy huge suv cars… so much unnecessary weight with a ferrari badge! 😢 2,2 tons with an ugly face
🧐
Stunning car, amazing engineering
