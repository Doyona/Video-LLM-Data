Truth is blind when one cannotDat. .only those who loves their brothers is worthy of being loved,true dat. You see I am the last negro Zwart in Dutch means what? Exactly 💯 I am the least of his and the greatest of his reborn in2012 in the Spirit and know that I am my brothers keeper. Rev7-17 and Isaiah 22-22 One like the son of Atom man. I have already walked in everyone's shoes and spent 21 years at least in prison in two states,an have records long enough to ✝️ a room.Yet YAHAYWAHAY his heavenly name chose me why? Because I offered my life for your sins and mine.Thats right I became sin so Yeshua Ben Joseph could come back without the world's sin.Truth 💔 Truth is this I have cut the vines seals,I have opened up the ring of fire and I have the Morning star Sun. Watch and see 👀 his power and the anti rise up against this country. Babylon the great falls when??? When my spirit leaves this body all the earth will burn an none will escape his judgement. Repent seek truth be born again, them that are born again will live again. But you must keep your faith and love God with all your heart and mind and strength. JZ the 1st JZ not that fake ass want a bee.One love One Race the human race. One nation under God, STOP being devided and stand for God, don't fall for anything. PEACE LOVE RESPECT. FORGIVENESS AND GOD WILL OPEN ALL PRISON DOORS AND LET HIS CHILDREN OUT. WORD BUT ONLY WHEN YOU STAND TOGETHER ❤

These are the people who would be washing other men’s clothes in the penitentiary, but they’ve never been inside one so they don’t realize that they wouldn’t survive.

Jesus is Coming📯📯📯🗣️⛪⏰🔊 Mathew4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.   Romans 10:9  If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 14Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by its gates. 15But outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. 16“I, Jesus, have sent My angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright Morning Star.”… Revelation 21:8,27 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death…🔥🔥😭 1 Corinthians 6:9,11 9 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And that is what some of you were.But you were washed,you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.,.,.,.,,,

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.  May God Bless you all!

Jesus is Coming📯📯📯🗣️⛪⏰🔊 Mathew4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.   Romans 10:9  If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 14Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by its gates. 15But outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. 16“I, Jesus, have sent My angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright Morning Star.”… Revelation 21:8,27 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death…🔥🔥😭 1 Corinthians 6:9,11 9 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And that is what some of you were.But you were washed,you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.,.,.,.🙏🏼🙏🏼🫂

† We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing in our hearts that Jesus died for us, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we have done or will do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                         †  Romans 10:9

this New generation.. ... (#wemissing the reals: Tupac, Big, Jay z; the back in the day Jay z The Life and times of Shawn Carter volume one two and three, the cold ass music like UGK pimp c n  Bun B, slimm thug, people that really spit real lyrics. everybody got to be on Adderall or something and they can't even rap they just came up and put their money in the music and got chains and diamonds but they are whack as f***😔 maybe I'm sleeping on them but as far as the Migos n future go that's that first generation BS to me none of them can really rap except offset to be honest the rest just be repeating the same old things I just missed my chance maybe it wasn't meant for me like DMX the realest.. said quote "if you wasn't born with it it wasn't meant for you to be," so true

Jesus is coming soon; please repent of your sin and turn to him.  Jesus was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, and God raised him from the dead on the third day, in fulfillment of the scriptures.  He loves you and wishes that none should perish.  He died so that we may have life, eternal life in heaven.  Read Romans 10:9-13 for starters.  Believe in your heart who Jesus is and what he did for you.  Are you paying attention to what is happening in the world??  We are at the end, Jesus is coming.
