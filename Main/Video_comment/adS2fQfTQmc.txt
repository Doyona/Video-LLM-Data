callender was on fireeeeeeee
messi scored it on my birthday 😍
You really start seeing patterns once you follow people like mansaarnault. That whole second half felt... directed
Messi responded to how do like that Messi Messi be like cool but I can do it better
7 - 2
I am a philly fan, and we can win but, WE NEED TO SCORE
Messi distance
Miami a ganar
Philadelphia e Flamengo!
Hoje tem vocês contra meu Mengão 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷❤🖤❤🖤❤
horrible league omg
GOAT🎉🎉🎉
commentator's ball knowledge is nil
Messi the goat rondalo suck butt
They’re too good for this league! Love watching it ❤
why ref no call 2:41 lmao. that foul is so obvious
Topp
insane game
Leo Messi's a pro amongst amateurs in the MLS! Messi's the Michael Jordan of football!
women soccer is better
Bedoya snap for that
PHI⚫️ 0-1 🐐MIA 0:35 Martínez PHI⚫️ 0-2 🐐MIA 1:45 Messi PHI⚫️ 0-3 🐐MIA 2:58 Jordi Alba PHI⚫️ 1-3 🐐MIA 5:30 Bedoya PHI⚫️ 1-4 🐐MIA 6:20 Ruiz
Imagine if Philadelphia could have scored any of their chances.
I can't believe messi is in the MLS as someone who was at this game Andre Blake played every poorly
If the goalkeeper didn't did that nice and opponents didn't did simple finishing mistakes this could be 4-4
Reminds the game vs mexico in world cup
⚽ 01:38 Messi
Wow
Messi Barselona ❤❤❤

Respekt an Gazdag
EN TODOS LOS GOLES DE IdM LOS JUGADORES DE PHILADELPHIA SOLO MIRAN Y NO ESTIRAN LA PIERNA🤦, NO ME IMAGINO LA MILLONADA Q LE DIERON A CADA EQUIPO Q ENFRENTÓ AL INTER DE MIAMI
1:54 the Phily guys holding the Messi jerseys 🤣🤣🤣 phenomenal
MESSI FROM DISTANCE
Seeing the goat happy makes me happy
They hide the scripted for Messi to score but Philadenphia had forgotten. They dont show it here or neither the full match to watch😅
I can not stand American commentators. Nice match, though.
0:28
I think my team was just star struck 😮
Bro it seems all scripted
Yes good goal my brother 💯❤️🙂
Messi is legit still the best player in the world!
Jamaicans are the smartest,  our keeper have the honor of having the best ever scoring a goal from the furthest distance he ever scored
No outside call on goal three? Just wondering
Nice to see Alba play 🇦🇷🇪🇸🇪🇸🗿🐐
Magic moment again for Messi, just like what he always did in these twenty years.
keeper: this one is for you Messi.  Messi from distance.
น่าเพิ่มอีกสักอีพี  เอาใาออกอีกนะ
Messi is Messing up the defenders and goalkeepers of the opposing teams😅
2 footballers's Sons played in this match Chris Donovan (Landon Donovan's Son) Harvey Neville (Gary Neville's Son)
bro stop talking about messi, this is piss league level, he would have never be able to do that in european leagues, ofc he would be able to score but not so easy
Smile on Messi's face says it all, whether he scores or any of his teammates. He looks happy playing here which I suppose was not the case when he was in PSG.
Messi effect ...Like to be easy wins all the games🎉🎉
Varsity playing cteam
yall see at 0:33 Messi throws his hand up and the play literally goes into motion leading to a goal..nice
Last goal was a goalie mistake. Defender was on striker, no need to come out.
AMAZINGLY COOL
Callender was flawless though got to admit he was in form
Everyone knows the results. But they forgot the next year they going to play in Mexico and we will break messis legs lol.
The referee of this match didn’t give a card for the faults on Gomez and Allen. The MLS federation should sanction him as an example for other referees so this kind of fault won’t happen again. He is completely under qualified for his job.
Gayest league ever
MESSI is very magnanimous in coming to play MLS soccer. It’s so beneath his level of skill it’s laughable. The US audience can certainly appreciate MESSI but at the same time they have to realize the USMNT is about as good as an MLS team and by the next World Cup they will not be very competitive with the teams coming to the tournament.
Lol. Very foolish goalkeeper.
Fixed matches are real, I paid for a match and I got what I paid for, it came out positive
inter miami defender should congratulate more with the goalkeeper.
The greatest footballer of all time. . Consistently for his entire adult life .... never had a bad season.  Wow
The great messi ❤
What's the philadelphia goalkeeper doing💀💀
1. If we were to play against Miami, and they decided to come and press “Block high,” how should we raise to 6 yards? a) Our keeper should play long in all situations. b) Our central defenders should be high in the penalty area and wide in order to allow the full-backs to come up more. c) We should involve a midfielder in the takeover of 'Zone One' (he would come next to our keeper initially). d) It doesn't matter, football is a sport where you constantly improvise.
Leo Messi
My word tha was tragic
Great for Messi but the level of defenses and GKs is ridiculous... I think he knew he was too old and weak now to get passed european defenses so he tried his luck in the disneyland league
It called football
Alba - traditional race to the gate))
That’s why messi better than Ronaldo!  Ronaldo and all see only the money.
MESSI’s Kick from that distance is definition of a BAWSE!!! Lol
Inter miami Messi
Hello goaltender 👏👏👏
Messi
The tactical level is very weak, almost non-existent. The technical quality is not good but it is improving little by little, these great veteran players help this development too. But this Miami team is fun, "Messi and his friends" are doing a good job.
The narrator praising Philadelfia just for them to concede a goal, it worked 🤣🤣🤣
Amazing saves from Callender
Messi messi messi 🎉🎉🎉
Joke league with joke defence
Thank god you guys don't put the score in thumbnail or title
Bro the judge is totally a ronaldo fan he was like when martines scored he was like take that messi
The Unions GK shirt says it all. The Bimbo 😂
americans finally witnessing real football, not that tom brady hand egg ball crap they play.
I am.happy to see Messi smile again, never saw him happy like this in PSG
Its a barbie league but who can miss the goat 🐐 EVER
i thought Philly guy was celebrating after there first goal.😅 Dude yall ain't winning against Messi & Miami.
Messi 🎉
Penjaga gawang Philadelphia mungkin lupa dia sangka itu miami yg biasa,padahal di situ ada bintang no 1 dunia,,bila bola di kaki mesi di garis 16 m + - anda gerak dikit maka dia akan langsung nendang bola ke arah yg berlawanan,makanya penjaga gawang kelas dunia sering terkecoh,messi tetablah messi skilnya gak bakal hilang karna skil alami bukan hasil prodah atau latihan
Will be fun to watch last standing in table team win a Cup
1:20 world class passing right there
The impact of Lionel Messi on Inter Miami is surreal. He not only scores and assists the team but also instills a winner's mentality in a team that was winless for 13 matches 🐐⚡🔥
el mejor del mundon !!!
Do you think there’s any chance for inter to win the championship?
Best Messi performance
At this point the MLS is a joke
INDONESIA HADIR TRS
Philadelphia can't even score simple goal 😅😅😅
Messi winning it all first year in the league.
CALENDAR CALLENDER ARE MAN OF THE MATCH , NO CONTEST.
Воротар - дирка
The keeper's a big HOLE.
i see GOAT❤
미국리그는 축구공 공기압 15psi 넘는것같은데.. 볼 튀는것 봐라..
Messi keeps on exposing this league as a farmers league it is.
Es la cabra simplemente!
Messi robbery
Messi is making a m9ckery of the MLS 😂😂 soccer is rasier than football
Inter Miami need to bring Ray Hudson back as commentator
Messi's goal Is beatiful
Vamos inter miami
Messi like button ❤
Messi GOAT 🐐
These guys are just scoring goals so they can give Messi a hug LOL
Now we can clearly see how bad the Burger League (MLS) is. Not even Top 25 in the world. Messi and Barcelona Lite having an easy time against these US College Kid Burger Flippers.
I bet you guys here only for Messi
Ion gone lie that goalkeeper is absolute garbage lol
When messi joined their keeper turned into prime buffon
Mls is boring asf
Great game!!! Is nobody gonna talk about that Philly Union goal tho? That was also a great one along with Messi’s insane goal 33 yds out
I know the first 11 of inter miami but i dont know the first 11 of inter milan
This league is way too easy
The last goal Kicker use back number 41..😅😅😅
It’s about time!
anyone else notice messi signalling the pass for the first goal lol
No matter how shitty they play, they don’t get relegated  MLS
Ese portero es una coladera
Messi = Goles ⚽⚽⚽⚽ MLS = Millones de views. Inter Miami = 💵💵💵💰💰
Rigged ass league for messi to win it!! a sunday league keeper could have stopped those first 2 goals.
screaming american announcers ruin the mls.
I've seen female gk's at the women's world cup better than that Philadelphia goalie. Christ! The defending in this league is disastrous.  It makes so much sense why Fifa (the game) is as ridiculous as it is, everything has to be an arcade.
whoa, messi manhandled at 2;40!!  temporarily...
Is this really league😂😂😂
Can't stand these american commentators, will you stop shouting
Give my idol pessi tap in d’or or he will retire 🥺🥺
Love how the commentator kept yapping about how the union had highest point best defence bla bla and them BAM ...immediately a goal ..like on your face!
Stellungsspiel vom Torwart 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
Scripted
Messi on fire!
Every one looks gay in pink
MLS needs a long way for improvement. Looks like I was watching scrims.
Honestly I’m so happy for Messi  he looks like he’s having so much fun playing for them and what a start for the GOAT 🐐 🇦🇷
Les américains avec leur Messi et leur niveau de National mdrrrr 😂😂😂
Messi seems a lot more happier than in Paris, finaly he have found a championship were he doesn't have to run to much
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
the GK is so bad
Please change these sports commentator. I rather leave it on mute :/
Goalkeeper  left the chat
Jokers league...😂😂😂
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
The best thing of all of this is that the level in MLS must increace in the future
Да, Кривцов еще мог бы поиграть в сборной
Bro who watches american football💀💀☠️
Is this a goalkeeper or what Philadelphia is having !!!  And their strikers tried best not to score !!  Match fixed man !
Josef Martinez, Messi quien se iba a imaginar esto! Un astro argentino y uno venezolano viva sudamerica y su fútbol
It all looks scripted.. how did Messi even score??? Is this a competition?
European football >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> American football ^^
Busquets pulls two players away and tells them where to go...goal.  Busi is past his prime but a legend.
scripted 🙂
Setingan nih😊
MLS is a joke to this Barça trio.
Messi goal is insane as usual The 🤫🐐
The best thing is Messi is happy with Inter Miami, & he's enjoying the gameplay ❤️😎
😂😂😂😂Only easy goals
These Union players missing worse than imperial storm troopers
Everyone blaming the Phily's goali while their defence is the one to blame. That Alba goal would be offside if the LB stayed in the line. Messi couldn't have scored the goal if they actually closed down on him and put pressure (Also the GK should do better).
GET THIS COMMENT TO A MILLION LIKES
american league is ass  these kids dont  know how to play i feel bad for messi
3:21 man I cant even look at that defensive awareness of apparently one of the best MLS teams. The barca bois at old age still way ahead of the whole MLS and show that MLS still have lot of work to do to become a worldwide top league
Easy League
Just rename the league from MLS to La Pulga league
😂😂😅,Jordy Alba Ft Leonel Mezzi..🕵🏻‍♂️😁👍🏻⚽
1:43 that must be one of da best goals of the century decade day year week even hour
Joke league😂😂
Fressi que te regalen la copa tbm ya aburres
Esta liga nadie la ve ni estando en eeuu, se imagina el Verdadero impacto de cr7
Messi la fifa la mejor dupla del futbol
Jesus, does he even need to get on the plane for the next game? He can score goals from his couch.
burger league
0:33 great pass
The goalkeapper this noob dude 😂😂
Messi and Trio Barcelona convert Miami become Great and Super Team .... just only one Month ...!!!!! INSANE ...
Watching Major League Soccer is like watching College games in South Africa. How can professional players make amateur mistakes throughout the whole game? European soccer isn't perfect but amateur mistakes take place 5% of the time but in the US it's more than 80% of the time. And here I thought I'd watch my hero Messi play in a competitive League 😢💔
Lets be real this league is a joke... Saudi is much more higher level
W
Zombie city vs messi😲
My man❤🎉
let's be honest phila's gk and strikers are terrible @@
fifa boy, mafia and funny league mls 🤣
Thank. You
If we weren't so close we'd be able to see the strings and whose pulling who. But fucking lio messi is so damn distracting
❤❤❤MESSIJORDIALBASERGIO❤❤❤TAYLORMARTNEZDRUIZ❤❤❤❤❤INTERMIAMITEAM....BERSAMA MESSI SEMUA DISULAP BERUBAH JADI PEMAIN TERBAIK👍👍👍👍👍👍👍GREETINGSFROM 🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨78
Wtf was the defender doing at the first goal 😂
Messi
Worst defenders ever
It’s like if Lebron went to the worst team in china lol. Instantly the best
Messi never fails to produce magic. What a stunning strike from the magician.
The defensive standards in MLS are really low, compared to the attacks. It is really hard to watch, they don't know how to keep a line, looks like they don't even know what offside is (just look at where number 17 in philly's team is and where the rest of the defense is at 2:57), they leave massive defensive holes (1:20 in miami's defense, the pass was class tho). It is like watching a third division league in some european countries, except for the world class players and the economical power of the teams
I adore Messi but many keepers in the women's world cup would have got to that
So let me get this straight, inter miami were a terrible team, that was barely winning games, and all of their players were trash, and now messi arrives and suddenly inter miami are the best and everyone is at peak form???? That doesnt make much sense. And dont say its the messi effect, causa its been shown that messi isnt able to carry bad teams. So i wonder what could be thats making inter miami the best team out of nowhere.
Mantap kiper miami jadi onfire 🔥
Sick
Nossa, essa liga só tem zagueiro marca fofo. Pro Messi é tipo jogar pelada.
Wow
Bro... are skipping over the fact that the philadelphia players are not defending, their goalkeeper was always wrong footed, and they missed like 3 open goals??? Am i the only finiding this suspicious??? More even after the last game against dallas where a dallas player literally and purposefully shoots a rocket header in his own net, helping inter miami back in the game
Can we all appreciate how Messi no matter what team he plays always brings his magic to him
I mean if philly weren’t poor in front of goal it could have been a more respectable scoreline...
That goalkeeper is joke😂😂😂
와 진짜 리그수준 처참하넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ k리그보다 못하는거같은데
Indeed we are watching greatness!
after watch more and more mls, now i think saudi league is so much better, wth mls doesnt look like professional league at all.
Imagine being that good that everyone thinks that no matter what you do, it is scripted
놀이터에서 장난치고 뛰어노는 아이 같은 메시. ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Inter miamis ball movement and passing are ridiculous.
Love the energy of the commentating. What a game!
This team kills
messi effect so magic , inter miami from underground to the sky
mickey mouse league
2million views. Im sure we are here to see Messi.
This game is simple 😂😂😂😂😂
Lol players and lol league
Awful match😂 no tactics nothing Sunday leagues are better😂
I'm not a football fan .. and I'm from Sydney Australia.. but I'm only here to see Messi in the MLS
Philadelphia keeper is kind of trash, positioning mistake in the first goal didn't anticipate it, messis goal was literally a ground ball 25 to 30 yards away
Awful Goalkeeping! 😂
I like how Messi’s just walking in the start😂
Ronaldo winning Al Nassr their first ever Arab Cup Messi taking Inter Miami to their first ever final THE GOATS CANNOT BE REPLACED
Messi and Inter Miami are doing great things, but man MLS is sooo bad. There’s like no pressure. Even the English championship is way better
If Philadelphia could finish their dinner this would have been a lot closer
been a barca fan since i could remember glad to see my heroes have a smile on there faces while playing there last chapter of their careers
Philly were piss poor. For a semi final you cant allow players space. Should have been more pressure on the ball. They should have sat in and dug deep. Inter found the gaps. It was too easy.
I'm here for Martinez goal
What an incredible goal from Leo Messi.That's why he is the best player in the world.Also fantastic goal from Jordi Alba.And Inter Miami's goalkeeper showed his class 🔥💙
Inter Miami needs an goalie from a top 5 Europe league. Swear to God mls keepers are shyt
What a gameplay from Inter Miami, but Lionel Messi goal is insanely good 🔥
Damn this the worst defense Ive ever seen since I started watching football
Dont know whats worse Womens Football or MLS lol
because of messi i have subscribe ❤❤🎉
Anyone noticed that jordi alba's goal was identical to the one he scored in  euro2012 final against Italy
Every match looks like fixed
I don’t see worst defen like MLS in any other league 😂
imagine if inter miami sign suarez
Proper Center Forwad goal.
who fan messi
Americans really need to know Ankara Messi
Messi Messi Messi
That’s how you realise just how difficult european football is .  Messi was trash in Paris and couldn’t find a spot after that . Now he‘s a hero in the MLS 😂
Honestly its like he's playing against kids 😂🤦🏿‍♂️
How the hell did Philly fumble that 4:07
Messi effect!  Everybody got eyes on MSL now
😮😮😮😮😮😮
😢🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Thank you MLS for not spoiling the ending so we could watch it in full suspense and enjoy the game  Take a hint NFL
MLS is definitely not a professional league.. Messi just from that distance score oh no surprising but I have seen stupid goals just like the one in women league…. Please STOP this shittty league
Seeing Philadelphia it shows how bad the MLS is my God no body even traces  back and messi fan enjoy seeing him score in burger league.Full respect to messi but it is way below his standards
This Taylor guy has a future😂❤the Goat effect is just massive
Callender has improved greatly because of Messi. Having to practice with him shooting on you.. Impressive!
Kindergarten Fußball 😅
Of course Inter Miami..💪💪💪💪💪
I’m happy to see Messi having fun in his rec league
Messi is playing Fifa comp. on Semi-pro at this point.
The GOAT power 😮❤
34 on trending the GOAT power ✨💥💯
Missing a lot of chances
The other team is week
Jordi Alba, Busquets and Messi on the same team again... reminds me of the late 00s, early 2010s Barcelona teams. As a madrid fan, its great to see how much barca has fallen off, but its also quite sad to see the end of an era. Messi playing against plumbers and mailmen is a crazy falloff from what he was doing.
Its always the philly teams
Te Amo MESSI ❤
the defense is so bad
Callendar deserves a call up for that third GK spot NGL.
From 1-4 to 4-1 GOAT effect
Messi! Messi! Messi!
One of the narrators was hating on Mesi after the first goal 😂he stayed quiet for a little after Mesi scoring that master piece 🤫 cállese 😅
Philly had 5 defenders too. ROFL
Don’t forget that in addition to Messi, Miami FC also recently added Sergio Busquets (free transfer), Diego Gómez ($3 million), Jordi Alba (free transfer), Facundo Farías ($5.5 million), and Tomás Avilés ($7 million + add-ons).  Of course they were going to be a lot better. Messi’s great, but the turn around of the team is not just due to him!
Just cancel the tournament and give Messi the trophy already goddammit!
Oloco 4 x 1 pro Inter Miami. Será que vai ser mais um título pro Messi? Se ganhar vai direto pra liga dos campeões da comcacaf
Exceptionally poor goalkeeping at the first goal, wow — where is he standing?  Edit: ok, the second one was even poorer, what is with this keeper?!?
I expected alot more from the union
Tata Martino always wants his celebratory huggies, what a cutie lmao
Everyone's talking about how good Messi was in this game but I think Callender was insane
Convengamos que el arquero de Philadelphia es una vergüenza
Messi in the MLS looks like me playing FIFA23 on amateur mode.  It's ridiculous how good he is.
Just me or did the Philly goalie have a shocker
Messi tem uma precisão de fora da área impressionante , ele mostrou isso na Copa do Mundo e agora vem mostrando de novo pelo Inter Miami .
Official Video from MLS get 2 millions vievs, Same video of this game in another fake accaunt - 8.2 million views😂 how it’s real
That’s one of the most horrendous displays of goalkeeping/ defending I’ve seen in a while.
The GOAT has made such a massive difference! Other guys like Alba, Busquets and Taylor have also been outstanding for Miami! Massive props to Callender's save and tenacity at goal too
Andre Blake is a legend, but...that performance was ABYSMAL. On Messi's goal, he's still moving backward when Messi shoots, so he's got no chance to get enough power in his dive to get to the ball.
andre blake has awful positioning as you can see on the opener so messi must have been dying to get the ball in that part of the field and slam one at the opposite corner
Barcelona boys just toying with the MLS. Credit to the Inter Miami team though. They really work hard to win the ball and create chances for the likes of Sergio and Messi 👏👏
❤
Yeah idk how you Americans are watching this nonsense.  A conference side from England could Join MLS and probably win it that’s how ass this league is.
union lost i is sad now😢😓
77 goals in 3 years, pretty decent. Messi scored 91 in a year💀
Did he say “on side flag’ 😂
MESSI'S ARRIVAL ENDED ALL COMPETITION IN THE LEAGUE, EVERYTHING IS NOW "FIXED"..  THERE'S NO POINT IN PLAYING THE REST OF THE GAMES, UNA VERGUENZA IGUAL Q EL MUNDIAL ARREGLADO D QATAR.
4:05 bruhhhhh how do you miss that?
Wow!!! This comment was perfectly said 1:59... 🔥 "What can he not do, we are watching greatness"
I'm always a proud Messi fan, anywhere, anytime. Full stop!
Mmmeeesssiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
MLS is rigged, ain’t no way Miami is this good to win it all. It’s a beautiful script for Messi and Beckham tho!
Terrible display from the Union and there coach by benching there best players and playing too conservative the first half. They had so many opportunities but couldn’t finish. What’s sad is Miami didn’t even play that good. Shameful display from a team that’s supposed to be one of the best teams the MLS has
1:42 Messi got old. Usually he would've dribbled thorugh the 3 defender in style but in the old days he doesn't want to run so much so he just finishes with an insane long shot haha
🦩🩷
From serial looser to serial winners almost overnight..now that is the definition Lionel Messi. All hail the GOAT
Does someone see that Messi change this team ?❤
1:42 🐐 things
I’m a simple man I see inter Miami I click
In my opinion there is no need to talk about whether Messi is too good for MLS or MLS too bad for Messi.... He's always been better than everyone else on the pitch for Barcelona, ​​Paris and Argentina too!  Secondly...  What a great game from Callender!!! Even he is getting better and better from game to game at the moment.  This Benjamin Cremaschi would be great for the Bundesliga here in Germany🙏🇺🇸🇩🇪 😁
Beckham enter my Amy slapped money to take  why after mess just to put eye to that mess. Now My Amy is performing great.
Inter Barcelona CF
U.S.A is a federation made from over 50 nations. so the league is international. the game is called FOOTBALL not Soccer. So you should call yourself: "Major International League Football", or MILF... 💩
Bro their keeper is terrible
this is me playing in rookie on fifa and trading messy to my team
You noticed how the whole 🌴 Miami team became more confident and played better with the arrival of Messi.  And how the goalkeeper's level has increased🫶🔥🔥
Y’all on Inter Miami and I agree but the goal from phi was absolutely crazy
Y’all on Inter Miami and I agree but the goal from phi was absolutely crazy
Inter Miami has a terrible defense. They need Ramos
Callenders toty card is gonna he insane boys
They just letting Messi and Miami win now lol
six match nine goal..   Messi real Goat🔥🔥🔥
That goalkeeper is horrible 😭😅
Messi doesnt even take long shots, goalie was brutal
Messi dan kawan kawan lagi latihan di liga MLS.
MLS : Messi league Soccer🔥
Thumbs up to Messi and Co... but anyone notice how horrible philadephia Keeper was?
Va a lograr todos los records!
Callender and Yedlin is so underrated!!!
jajajaja, ahora a la final
Philly could’ve had 5 this game, monterrey not gonna be an easy one
How in the world did that Philadelphia Goalkeeper  manage to be a professional? Horrible positioning in the first two goals. That Messi shot should never ever end up being a goal.
this league can't be serious. Just look at the goaldkeeper or the defending against Alba third goal.
Messi mania in usa..well played calendar... calendar played the role of dibu Martinez..
The goalkeeper OMG😂😂 That's insane
Do the opponents even know how to play soccer??
Messi should start switching teams at the half to keep the games close
4:04 clearly offside but they keep playing😂
I know a fixed match when I see one 😂
Ma che livello è? Sembra di vedere una partita di terza categoria. In europa il tiro di messi sarebbe stato parato anche da un ragazzino...
How many Miami away fans were there at Philadelphia last season?
What a game by Callender
That Drake guy sure practicing with Messi in the training damn hard
Goalkeeper is working at McDonald's while playing football 😂
dear Messi come back to Europe
Amazing Magic
that saves at 50mnt though.. 😮
Talk about cartoon football
Messi just made MLS boom worldwide.
When your best player makes the game easy for everyone around him... Yes! Good things will happen. Now you can't sleep on anyone because your best player will encourage everyone to "play the right way". I'm so happy to finally watch "football" I can appreciate. A team playing the game like a team. No "Hero Ballers" with blinders on.
Why does it look so scripted?
paeada
Philly goalkeeper has the worst positioning in professional football 😂
que gol do cara do union
jordi que gol em
messi que golaço
That Goalkeeper works in KFC and Uber driver part time
Can't spell Philadelphia without an L. Lets go messi
From Europe to USA learning each league thanks to our genius Leo Messi
This time Messi scored almost from stadium car parking 😂..GOAT
❤❤❤
Messi League Soccer
Martinez not knowing Messi's goal still rolling for the whistle
Magic
"No defensive pressure" seems to be a common theme in MSL matches. But seriously, every Inter Miami game has me smiling right now. Its amazing to watch this team's journey with Leo Messi.
Messi 🐐❤️
Philadelphia modo Estrada
did he just say Leonardo Messi?
The philadelphia goal is more impressive
Grande messi e bosques e Jordi Alba hanno trasformato la squadra
That long range ground shot goal says more about the level of the goalkeeper than about Messi
Nothing better than making a team play at their best, even better than scoring a bunch of goals.
Give Calendar his props
No way Miamis opponents are trying,, questionable stuff is going on. Lack of effort, intensity and the defenses take absolute liberties. The Philly chance at minute 54 is a perfect example
fds até eu defendia essa merda que o messi fez
Inter Miami is amazing!!!
its not called soccer
Stop calling it 'Soccer' ! It's FOOTBALL. Played with your FEET and a Ball.  90% of World population call it Football (or a direct translation of 'foot-ball' in their language. Americans value democracy, right? So accept the majority vote. Stop calling it Soccer.
why did Josef Martinez's celebrate like its a Fifa glitch 😂😂😂
Philly strikers are like kindergartners
Messi at ils level, poor player for poor championship!
que mal defienden los yanquis dios mio
Is that Philly GK a professional player? 2 easy goals given.
Did he say semyyfinals😂😂
Taylor really is a better player with the ball than most of the midfielders in europe
If Miami want to cruise in the MLS, they need 2 class center back´s. if philadelphia are the top team in the last 10 years and they play like this. if Miami put some more signings, they are going to the top.
Anytime any Philly team loses America wins.  Thank you Miami!
belle le difese delle squadre americane :D
CR7 GOAT🦅
why do all those team logos look like shyte?
Great game from Miami but damn philadelphia's keeper was atrocious in this game...
Suarez, I hope Suarez joins, and the goalkeeper will choose, goals from Messi or Suarez 😅
respect to Callender, but these burger league goalkeepers just nuts
“The fewest goals conceded”  *immediately conceded goal*
the famer is back at it again🐐
Callender is good!
Rigged
No CALENDAR for 2023 you're my CALENDAR FOR 2024😊😊😊😊
Great performance from Callender, portrayed very good performance 🙌🙌. Let's appreciate his saves 🎉❤
the blakes performance was so bad
The Philly goalkeeper is awful…
Messi😊😊😊😊
Messi
I hope they qualify for the club world cup. They going to destroy a lot of teams👌🏼
Messi scored a Banger
I wish we stood a chance :(
Simply amazing
Messi never played in the best league. Too scared. 😂
🖕 Messi go away! Ronaldo better!!
Callender 🐐
The defence in this league is a joke button
Commentary seems like wwf commentary😂😂
That goalkeeper is a joke.... That Messi long shot wasn't a stunner
MLS has to be aggressive than Saudi and pick the best players too.
If Messi would play wearing suit and tie, it would be the appropriate clothing for the elegance and maestry.
Leo has taken the last place MLS team to the Leagues Cup FINAL  Magical Messi!
This is like watching amateurs vs professionals  Messi makes miracles :D
Goat leo ❤️❤️❤️
Philadelphia players are lazy 🤣🤣🤣
bruh MLS really needs to make other teams better. Like holy miami is soooo dominant.
That goalie is good! Callendar is a baddasssss
Major League is so as* and there's people who say its better than Saudi League LOL!
Anyone here who only knows Messi😂
Es increíble el Inter de Miami no pierde un partido desde que llegó Messi
I cant believe I am watching MLS lol. But seriously the Philadelphia GK was asleep
Messi va hacer goles de todas las formas posibles en la MLS
I don't care about the quality of their soccer. But honestly man, now mls is more entertain than beckham, rooney, henry or ibra era. Messi is pelle of this century.
This league is a joke. You’ve got Philadelphia fans waving Miami Messi shirts in the air when he scored. 🤣🤦‍♂️
Philly needs a keeper 😂😂😂
Le niveau du gardien de Philadelphia est assez médiocre, comme leurs attaquants.. Normal que Messi s'éclate là-bas, il a l'impression de jouer contre une équipe de d4 😂
Messi makes things look too easy, just to point out how difficult Messi's goal is to score, look at the clip immediately after Messi's goal. Gazdag (#10) shot it from similar distance
Philadelphia's goal keeper looks more like a swimming amateur than a professional footballer
The commentators make the game sound like WWE 😂
Eeeee ronaldo clear
Night and day difference between Miami’s keeper and Philadelphia’s! Was that their 3rd string keeper? The defense wasn’t that great but dang that keep sucks, didn’t even get a hand on a single ball. Plus that shot from Messi was miles out and didn’t have a ton of pace on it.
Wow... Greatness at it's best....  Messi.....
Defending is so trash, esp first goal. you gotta get to that ball and make a block
Wow!!! Callender!!! Took a hugeee deflection to beat him...
Thought there was a writers strike but clearly not😂
Selam selâm SELAM ⚽💜
Seeing messi so happy makes me happy
messi the goat
MLS HAS THE MOST ELEGANT TEAM LOGO EVER
Messi is pure trolling this league. 🙈
This might be the start of a wild fairy tale for Inter Miami….👀
Philadelphia nightmare  ....... What a phrase
IELTS STUDYING AM LEARNING SOMETHING NOBODY CAN IGNORE
Philly has the worst defense I’ve ever seen my god.
NO DEBATES messi is the god of football, hes a true leader, he made the worst team of the MLS the best one
Messi is awesome
MESSI has brought wild popularity and crazy amount of money to Inter Miami CF and MLS. The biggest winner? Apple TV
Hey Philadelphia; Spain Sevilla goolkeeper BONO is a great option.
👋👋👋👋👋
Ligma balls!
GOAT 🐐
Philadelphia goolkeeper !!! 😮
Bro’s playing on easy mode 💀😂!
Messi teaching the LIFE of FOOTBALL.
Philadelphia goalkeeper ☕
America You have the Goat
Hey messi i think you need to turn up the difficulty on of your fifa one time,  this is like playing with 4 yo kids xD
This is the best definition of farmer league. Most peoples from different backgrounds will support Messi and team. The commenters, the audience, the artists and so on. Even their opponent will support Inter Miami. And the average quality of palyer in every team is quite low compare of MLS standard. That's one of reason that make me not interesting and boring to watch the game till end. Maybe MLS can make positive changes for the excellence of American football in the future.   Sorry just my little opinion. I have to admit that.
Joset y Messi la dubla del inter Miami 😎
Opponent had the worst goalkeeper
4:10 this is why the MLS is suck garbage LMFAO. dam.
I love how MLS reuploads their highlights so they keep showing up on my recommended even tho i watched it 30 min after they uploaded it
The goalkeeper is an paid actor
MLcircuS  OLÉ  😭😭😭😭😭
The commentator is 💥they are good makes the game more interesting
Philadelphia's goal keeper sucks 😂😂
How did messi score that this guy has some eyesight
I love those casters
Haha
Scooter is Phillies Goalmusic 😂
Messi ya no tiene nada que demostrar. Sabemos que es el mejor jugador de la galaxia.  Ahora solo esta disfrutando el futbol 👌
Messi magic.. makes the whole team and coach look good... Drake Calender... what a goalkeeper.. a move away to a bigger club if he keeps this up for the full season.. he is class
Messi’s good yeah but Andre Blake was fuckin awful in this game supposed to be one of the best goalies in the league he has to play better
Philly trash city trash team
❤
The keeper should have stopped the Miami second goal.
USA and Soccer😅 That's new for me.
Messi is the best of all time ❤❤❤❤❤
My dear bejesus, goalies are aweful in MLS
Messi is class
Embarrassing performance from the Union, Philly deserves a better team, one that actually plays in Philadelphia.
Messi dragged that ball like the World Cup goal against Mexico 🎉amazing
For starters. This wasn't just possible of Messi. The name you might've to search for is Busi. Sergio Busquests. The man makes a lotta difference to a team.
😢Messi has gone to MLS to enjoy football or sorry soccer
This is for Philly, you gotta let go those who fouled up and get new quality players!!
Messi should not be scoring from there. Keeper was woeful
Goal keeper wasn't even looking for Messis goal
What a goal from this distance. What a accuracy!!
philadelphia gk... mls level
Messi ❤from IND 🇮🇳
With all due respect to Inter Miami, Philly's goalie was absolutely terrible. This is some of the worst goalkeeping displays I've seen in a while. Directly at fault in each and every goal he conceded.
Now Robert Taylor can call himself a football player
there is no way on this earth messi scores that long distance goal in europe tf😂 its too easy for him
I love Messi and all but he is really playing against bricklayers, did you see what the Philadelphia players missed???
That was smooth Mr announcer. I imagine it went over a lot of people’s head. Miami Dream. Philadelphia Nightmare. Dreams and Nightmares. Bravo
Was certain the Union would win it. And kinda slow down the whole INTER Barca E Miami show! But no such luck. WTG, well done, and congrats🎉😮😅
Scores at minute 19, like #19 his old number, from the day he joined PSG to the day he joined Inter Miami, was literally 666 days later. Coincidence? Or just a numbers game lol
Messi is happy and the entire football world celebrates 😅
Messi 💙💙💙✅
Not scripted btw
For Messi MLS is easy mode
lol 😂 I’m of a belief that inter Miami had a deal with the goalkeeper if you know what I mean
Messi olmasa bu ligi izlemem amk
MLS is like watching  football in very slow motion...
Siu
It doesn't take "rigged play" or "terrible defending" to stop that shot from Lionel Messi 😎
taylor plays so well i rly like him
Taylor Twellman hurts my ears.
Qué mal portero en el gol de Messi
MLS :- Messi likes scoring ❤
Would be nice to invite few teams from Central America too,
Humiliation much 😭
MLS top 3 GK  1 Roman Burki 2 Drake Callender( could be 1 honestly) 3 Djordje Petrovic
Goal from Messi 🔥🔥
Why don't I see any comments about how absolutely terrible Andre Blake was in this game? That has to be the worst game of his professional career. Bad enough that I wouldn't be surprised if he was throwing the match.
Rosa y Negra
I love how the commentators act like this is really big deal in messi’s career
the union goalie may have been paid off
Its messi league soccer not major league soccer 😂this single handedly does it❤
Messssssssiii🎉🎉🎉😂
If drake wasn’t the goalie union would of won
Nothing is better than seeing the Union get obliterated at home, Miami made them look silly! What an all-around performance by Inter!
Shocking goal keeper.. 😮
Messi❤❤
Haha I had no idea how awful the MLS really was. Messi is just playing around , no sweat and still scores 2 goals every game LMAO
MLS is toooo easy for messi lmaooo
Everyone: Messi wont win a ballon dor playing in the MSL anymore. Messi: Hold my bear
Hi.. Indonesia ! 😅
Such bad defending LMAO
💞💞🇧🇩🇦🇷Messi🇧🇩🇦🇷💞 মেসি,বুটকেস,আলবা মিলে বিপক্ষ ক্লাব গুলোকে পাড়ার ক্লাবে নামিয়ে এনেছে!
🐐
Philly honestly could’ve won this game, but the lazy defense and the missed goals were just awful
it's like everyone at inter Miami has lifted their game
Can't wait to go the Nashville vs Miami game on Saturday now for the Championship, should be a banger!
MLS stands for messi league soccer
1:43 Messi is just to good what a strike
0:35 the keeper positioning, leaving a tremendous part of the goal open 💀💀💀
Impressive coachhing from Miami, but wow everytime they play the teams defense are all asleep, no covering runs, every man defends for himself, nobody runs, the MLS needs good coaches because it's laughable
Such poor, poor defending.  It's almost like they have been told to let Messi score. The Messi League Soccer is living up to its reputation.
I am capable of being a world class player in the MLS on God
Messis Skill in USA > Ronaldos Hype in Arabia
MLS league boring just watching cause messi and Barcelona teams
Либо матч договорной, либо за филадельфию играют очень плохие игроки 😂
Me encantan todos 😊
The union players were putting to much pressure on Busi thinking they’ll stop Messi 😂😂. Let’s go Miami
Wanna see  luez suarex together
Imagine busquets looks quick in the mls , that let you know how bad this league is. Now you know why riqui puig looks that good in the mls while he had no chance in Spain   I like the way Messi enjoy his last station. Well deserved rest
Miami the new Barcelona from 2010
this games looks more of fixed matches
Lo q fallo el manco a puerta vacía 😂😂
these defenses are awful 🤣
The save from Callender was insane!
Phili need a new goalkeeper.
😂😂😂feels great to score in a beginner league
Philadelphia Union's keeper is so bad
Amazing how a whole team of losers can improve so quickly. I think they play knowing that Messi is there, stealthy, ready for them. So, they play completely loose, worryless, knowing that if they screw it up, the new guy would come out with a rescue plan. Now it's even more dangerous with Alba. But remember Alba arrived after the 4th game, so the team was already going up at logarithmic curves
Muy bien por el portero ! No solo es Mesi ! Es todo un equipo.
Easy League 😂
He will make 60 goals. The league is an absolute joke for him, lets be honest. Its like second tier european league..
Really poor goalkeeper 🤦🏻‍♂️
The team is flying. Go Miami
Did no 17´s controller disconnect before Jordi Albas goal?
no pueden ser tan malos  en hpiladelia de perderse goles claros
The legendary messi 🙌 if only I ever made it professional. I'd be the haitian messi😂😂😂
I am sorry but keeper is very week! for union
Der Tormann von Philadelphia ist sicher MC Donald,s Angestellter … der haltet ja garnicht,s 😂😂
Messi goal was Billiards technique
messi vs sunday league trashes
please pass on this channel all the complete matches live but deferred from Inter Miami. Thank you
What a wonderful keeper Philadelphia have 😂😂
The level of defence of both teams is criminal. C tier European teams defend better.
When i saw Taylor keeping the ball and pass like a Messi
The once guy who score at 30 meters low to the ground
lil bro name if wagner 🤣🤣🤣
The goat 😎😎
Бро Кривцов вот ты фартовый однако, никогда про тебя не знал, теперь не забуду. Месси рядом, красавчик бро
As an Englishman it is very interesting to see Americans experience Messi’s greatness first hand. I’m sure most of them had heard about him but now you see what the fuss is about.   Also, I am enjoying seeing MLS players I wasn’t aware of - this Robert Taylor guy looks great.
EMBARRASSING defending, no wonder why the MLS is known as the Retirement League across the world.
It's embarrasing that a washed-out Messi can come here and single-handedly dominate the MLS teams so easily; 4-1, 4-0, 3-1, 4-0…
My home team got demolished
😂 the game was joke for messi
Inter Miami has the most chilled managers of all time. Bro looks more like a spectator than a manager 😂😂
No one defends in MLS. Why? Cuz the good players are in Europe?
American and MLS can't play football and also can't score the open goal. Poor quality League
🎉🐐🦁
Bramkarz Philadelfii sprzedał meczyk 😊
MLS = Mediocre League Soccer
To be honest I think I only know two teams in MLS mainly LA Galaxy and now Inter Miami But following it more due to the fact that Messi is still producing his magic. With time MLS could overshadow all football leagues but progress not only has to continue but pick up some pace. In time players and managers will be moving over to MLS in their prime and not for retirement.
From what i saw the only 3 good players were the obvious 3. And Philadelphia was the better squad by a big margin. Its just inters 3 who got the win really. Every time anyone else would get the ball they panic and pass to the other team.
That Philadelphia keeper wtf was he doing, that was just a simple low shot, i can save that with my legs... Ffs man...
Imo, this win proves that the league is bought. I've been to Subaru Park at least 20 times, and never, NEVER have they ever played the goal song of the opposing away team after they have scored. Not in any league game, not in the Concacaf CL, and not ever in the MLS playoffs. Yet here, when Miami scores, lights start flashing and Miami's goal song starts blaring.   If that ever happened in a regular league match and - for example - Atlanta's train horn played when they scored at Subaru Park, the Sons of Ben would probably leave the stadium. But of course, because it's Messi, they roll out the red carpet and make him welcome with several individual player mistakes and his own goal song. Subaru Park has historically been a fortress because of its hostile atmosphere and its devoted fanbase, but as soon as Messi arrives, it becomes as welcoming as a 5-star resort from the official's end (give credit to most of the fans who cheered their own team on).   While I appreciate the publicity Messi is giving the MLS, it sets a terrible precedent that powerful and influential players can uproot the whole establishment and turn a formerly competitive and professional league into their own personal playground. It's only been a month and the poor refereeing decisions that favor Miami already are innumerable. It's evident that the league establishment is rooting for Messi. It becomes disheartening that teams with swaths of money and influence can crush well-run and developed teams in sports. No one outside of Philadelphia roots for the Union, and the only reason they have gotten good results is because they have been well managed and run for the past decade; then, teams like Miami and LAFC are able to beat them because they can throw money and sign big players to get it done (Bale, Chiellini, Alba, Busquets, and Messi). It's the same thing that is occurring in the EPL now with Man City.   If the MLS really wants to make football(soccer) similar in popularity in the US as it is in Europe/South America, they need to encourage youth development and show that if teams are smart and well-run, they can succeed. The most critical part of the game is its universal ability to be played by all. Hundreds of professional European/South American players grew up in poverty and built their skill because they were inspired by other players that started out in similar situations. However, when you have teams that just throw money at marquee signings and get the literal league on their side, it drastically discourages any young American player to get good at the game because it gives the impression that MLS is nothing more than a rigged playground for the rich. Developments like this will give great publicity for the league for a little while, but it drastically harms the league and the country's footballing future in the long run.   If Alba, Busquets, and Messi were distributed across 3 teams, we would have a far different and more productive situation that would encourage competition and make games interesting. However, in the current situation, I would not be surprised if Miami win all major North American club competitions for the next two years - the competition is basically dead at this point; Messi will keep miraculously winning like this as he tours the United States like Taylor Swift. Fantastic win for Inter Miami, but a monumental loss for the future of the sport in the US.
Glad you don't call this football
MLS (Messi Loves Scoring)  🔥🔥🔥
The MLS game level is incredibly low, non-existent defense. Messi would have never scored that first goal in Europe. It's entertaining to watch champions style on these teams but it's also  sad and plain unfair, that Alba goal too was hilarious.
Lmao look at all the bandwagon fans.
Commentator about Philadelphia Union: 🤓"...the most points, the most goals scored, the fewest goals conceded since 2020... HERE'S A CHANCE FOR MARTINEZ, AND A GOAL!!!😳🤯.... 😂 made one of the best teams look bad in minutes.  Messi, Busquets & Alba turned one of the worse teams in the MLS into a winning team. Kinda nuts for just 3 players to totally transform a team like that.
Wtf is that
Man of the match should be Calendar. What a performance He is on fire.
Miami goal keeper is stunning❤
Burger league😂 what was the Philadelphia keeper doing.
The GK didnt do his job well today. 2 Goals from Martinez and Messi, not only the GK didnt center himself, he also didnt move forward to minimize the space of the Goal.
the amount of views these games are giving mls
Messi lanzó así xq el arquero estaba nervioso desde el primer gol 😅😂
Sorry but mls football tactics are a joke 😂😂
🔥🔥
Ronaldo had to bride most of Europe to make the Saudi league relevant… Messi just had himself and has made the MLS more relevant than the Saudi league 😅
Philadelphia keeper had a really awful day. Just seems like every decision he made to come out or not come out was punished.
From 30 yards out not in lol yanks just don’t know this game it’s funny & sad
Taylor Twellman's yelling is so entirely unnecessary
MLS smh. He watched that ball roll toward him from 2000 feet away lol. Traveling 30mph.
Callemder's performance is something else I love it
MLS league is cakewalk compares to European league
This game in USA is nothing without European football
lets talk about the keeper looolll omg, he wouldnt make it into a  regional division in  any europe league,  thats amateur stuff, jesus!!!
What kind of goalie was that  I bet Messi can’t do that in Europe .
Philadelphia goalkeeper 😅😅
They way Robert Taylor is playing, I imagine their training sessions being like "So how would you do it Messi?"
It’s called football btw
Inter Miami lol that funny
It's crazy how last year it was hard for MIA to score, this year with ease
If you hate seeing this and you just hate soccer. It is amazing that we get to witness this level of soccer in the US. I think Miami goes undefeated the rest of the year and I won’t care one bit because this is just fun to watch. Martinez and Taylor are the perfect fit to play with other players at this level. I’m an RSL fan, but I will be watching every single Miami game.
Messi from way down town! Bang Bang!!!
Taylor's pass to Alba, and the super saves by Callander.... wow...  as important as the the 3 star players last night.
The Philadelphia Union’s Goalkeeper was either bribed or something is wrong somewhere. He could have caught most of the goals and their players missed clear cut chances (hopefully, it wasn’t deliberate)
A WHOLE WORD RN WATCHING MESSI IN MLS 🤯🤯🤯
Rigged
💯👏👏
Messi been getting the lebron treatment but I don’t think it would matter. But u can visibly tell defenders are less physical with him
Phili's goalee needs to be fired on the spot
The goalkeeper save was good
Bro these league
Defenders in MLS are worse than a joke, because a joke has meaning.
"How do you like that messi?!"  *messi proceeds to score a slow out of the box goal and humbled the commentator* 💀
5:16 did the commentators just curse a cuss word
Taylor Twellman had money on the game. His commentary was so bad
My keeper smiles and concedes the 2nd goal I'll be on a madders
It is now Messi League Soccer
What can he not do
Znowu efekt messiego z 32 m strzela bramkę ogórka
gara2 mesi jadi nonton MLS
Esse goleiro do Miami é uma muralha!! 👏🏻😳
🇺🇸 don’t know jack about “soccer” meatriding outta hand
People are massively raising their levels in this team now. If you want to be a part of this, these are the standards. It’s had a really positive impact on the squad to get to know what world class looks like, to have it walk beside you, breathe beside you.❤🎉
It really is almost hilarious how much better Miami is now than every other team on the continent.
callenders absolutely great, those saves were critical ⭐️
Philadelphia should fired their kiper
Messsiiii
The Keeper has improved so so much
Messi really did do a “hold my beer” on Martinez’s goal.😂 Commentator said “how do you like that Lionel Messi” Messi-“hold my beer”. Crazy from about 40 out.😮
Number 17 on the 3rd goal. Come on, you played him onside.
The ONLY G.O.A.T.🐐 This is Lionel Messi 🛐
ya para que juegan la final, otro regalito para messi.
Is it just me or is this not even fair anymore. I can just see Miami rolling every team they play.
bro this just isnt fair 💀
Messi could beat the whole USMNT by himself.
it's just too easy
Error 404, Philadelphia Goalkeeper Not found
Union goalkeeper is booty
are the philadelphian players hitting the goal or clearing the ball for inter miami
2:08 broooo💀  wetin be is this?🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Philadelphia's 17, in 0-1 and 0-3, is a shame to this sport in his position.
Yes, I understand that Messi is good despite his age, yes, I understand. that he is the World Cup Champion.)) But damn, either this show with Miami was bought) or the level of MLS is so weak that a couple of players who came from Europe are "put on the ears" forever championship  you can throw rags at me..)
The greatest of all time 🐐
i knew they had busquets, didn't know they had alba too... its a whole live barca reunion tour
Cómo han crecido los de Inter de Miami! ya no solo es Messi sino todo el equipo. En este partido me quedo con las salvadas de Callender y el golazo de Messi.
Messi > Philadelphia cheese 😂
2:08 💀
Again🫠🥹! Next please🐐🐐🐐
what a terrible performance by Philadelphia's goalkeeper, at least 2 of Miami's goals were is fault. Philadelphia's offence, also cost it the game.
do all the Home fans sit with Away fans. Is the a Philly home game? bizarre.
If I don’t save Messi’s goal make I bend 😹
Copa McDonalds de amateurs, Messi hará 5000 goles
That keeper must be betting😂😊
Golazooo David Ruiz 🇭🇳⚽❤️
Messi effect
Keeper fell asleep on that 2nd goal
Second goal is a joke c'mon dude from many yards away 1:40 , its a shame that mls teams dont show respect for their fans and put a tough game against miami, all the mls teams become to excited to play against messi..
Literally 3 goals they waste🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Those guys got two goals and dash it a way🤦🏽‍♂️
rigged cup
I need Miami to add a second team named AC Miami with Benzema, CR7 and Pepe
It's like taking candy from a baby for Leo
fifa mobile goalkeeping and defending
Opponent are very easy , loose defense
Callender is freaking amazing, shame he couldn’t make it out with a clean sheet but damn he was 🔥
This league is getting crucified
Msuhnya nub
Everytime a mls team plays against the miami-messi team they dont play the same, they're like too nervous or too excited to play againts messi and end up making a lot of mistakes, you will see the strong nashville wont be the same in the final, probably will receive a goal before the first 5 minutes, a shame that miami cant find a serious and strong adversary..
Stop calling Kryvtsov Krystov, he is Kryvtsov
1:19 This pass deserved a goal
I would watch more MLS if Englishman commentated it
They only need to bring smalling and payet to win the league
Nah im sorry but phillys keeper is allowing them to score....  3 of the 4 goals he could of saved. Trust a prem fan. The eye test overalls the stats test
Messi gives spirit,morale and victory to the club, players and fans
I live in Orlando, but now I'm a Miami fan...
The MLS is by best a 3rd tier league... its quite pathetic how the league developed in the last decade. Clown Competition tbf, the defenders are amateur level.
Philadelphia's goalkeeper is made of wood. In Messi's goal he reacted slower than a snail.
Messis goal should of never went in. Terrible defending and even worse goaltending. Smh and the same thing goes with the first goal. Terrible positioning by the GK. Messi just stat padding in a weak ass league
you can tell that Messi is happy for his teammates from his heart
That goal was fire🔥
Didn't know the quality of MLS was this low 😂😂
"how do you like that Lionel Messi" - I think he showed you- Dont ever talk down on he goat even with his own teammate!! lol
No im sorry but thats absolute bullshit. That keeper could of saved 2 of them goals against Martinez and messi. (Premier league fan) hes deliberately letting them in  CLEAR AS DAY!!!!!! We seen this at Barcelona keeps allowing barca to scoring its no hiding secret.
The Messi show is insane. But lets be honest, philadelphias defence is ridiculous
MLS = Messi Love Scoring
the GOAT, and boys
Mamma mia le difese sono scandalose, sono meglio quelle di terza categoria
Just give Miami the cup already. Sheesh.
Piladelphia goalie's positioning is the worst ever hahaha
No doubts about Messi greatness but come on, that defending and goalkeeping from PHI ... third division ENG team would do better.
Anyone else not buying this?
idiot and blind players + idiot and handless goalkeeper = MLS... If anyone from outside America comes, he will be king anyway.
I didn't realize how bad the MLS really is until Messi got here. Don't get me wrong, Messi is great, top three of all time, IMO, but wow the MLS just plays terrible defense, over and over again.
Even the Miami keeper is turning into A too class player
Beckham is doing wonders there!
MESSI IS SO GOOD 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Lion Messi 💪
Buying Messi is the best thing inter Miami did
Poor goalkeeping, poor conversion of good chances to goals. This was all on Philly though not taking away Inter Miami's effort and persistence.
my guy gives a 30XP boost for all creatures within 99 Range
Tf is this league😭😭😭
muss sich für die barca connection wie kreisliga anfühlen :D
watching MLS makes me feel watching WWE due to commentary
GOALS (Spoiler Alert) Goal 1: 0:32 (Inter Miami) Josef Martínez 3' Goal 2: 1:32 (Inter Miami) Lionel Messi 20' Goal 3: 2:48 (Inter Miami) Jordi Alba 45+3' Goal 4: 5:28 (Philadelphia) Alejandro Bedoya 73' Goal 5: 6:12 (Inter Miami) David Ruiz 84' Final Score: Philadelphia  1-4 Inter Miami
It's just nice to see everyone on the pitch having fun.  Makes it more enjoyable to watch and probably more enjoyable to play.
Salvo 2 o 3 jugadores todos los demas son espantasoso!
Everyone has a Calendar 🗓
Inter-Miami goal keeper was clutch this game. One got in bc those ppl blocked his view BUT he did so good this match so kudos to him. This team is the worst in MLS - it's still wild to think about but we know its the MESSI EFFECT..
Calendar was Man of the match for me, Messi was phenomenal though
Kinda sad that Phildealphia didn't advance, but I'm just happy Messi got to see the city of brotherly love, AKA my hometown.
Le niveau de la mls est vraiment catastrophique
That messi goal❤
MLS the best at provoding us with content from games. No other league does it like them. They seem to appreciate more the game for the fans than the leagues in Europe
Defenders not even trying to stop
Blake had a rough night...
kya tatti hai,, scripted lag rha hai
Really poor positioning and decision making from Blake, this was terrible.
Union missed many easy goals
Messi will become all time top goal scorer
THE KING
Andre Blake with some mad alligator arms in this game. Pretty poor goalkeeping.
LM10 ❤
Messi has improved the whole team
The 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Good league
I need to be signed in the MLS asap
Messi is obviously extremely good, but the defending in the MLS is very bad. I think almost no team could stand a chance against any english 4th division team.
4:21 what a Save 🔥🙌
finally you get the idea that FOOTBALL is a good sport and call it soccer and use yards!? WTF is a yard. nobody on the whole rest of the earth knows what a yard is.
First time I have seen a referee wave play on for a blatant red card tackle, is it because the ball fell to Messi’s feet? We’re gonna completely ignore the fact that someone got wiped out from behind with studs up? This league is a joke……
Philadelphia almost had it 2 clear goals missed
philadelphia  gk would suck even in the women league, a chair has better positioning than him
I'm sorry but PL and other European league players who feel like they're past it should just come to the MLS Wilfred Zaha, Neymar, Benzema, come light up this league and push talent here not in the middle east 😂
😊
Messi is spoiling his talent in MLS
Final will be tougher the opponents is good
The positioning of the keeper for the first goal was poor. The second he should've got a glove to it.
The positioning of the keeper for the first goal was poor. The second he should've got a glove to it.
"Fewest Goals Conceded" and then 0:36 Happened, from there it all went south PU. Philly got jinxed hard. 😭
MLS (Messi League Soccer)
Fun fact. The goal Messi made in this match is his longest distance goal ever made in his career
Easier to play football with busquets at the Middlefield
Blake tiene muy mala posición
Wow mls is a joke 😂
happy messi ❤
noboddy:jordi alba a new Left winger
Philadelphia played without goalkeeper definitely
All Inter matches are bought. I can't explain in another way how the Philadelphia players missed the empty net 2 times ...
What was that philadelphia defence doing?
THE SAVES ARE INSANE!
soccer in america is absolutely ridiculous.  Rating: unwatchable!.
callendar is pretty good 🔥
Still better than oil money Saudi league
What an unusual performance from Blake
Mls player need more practice in defs
Bro they dont put 100%. There's a cheat in with miami
C'est quoi ce gardien même moi je suis meilleur au cage 😂😂😂😂
Ptdr le niveau de la compétition même moi je joue mieux 😂😂😂😂
🤣 🤣 🤣 Philadelphia was supposed to be the first real test for Miami?
Seems even less competitive than saudi league
The only thing we need here in Europe from MLS are these commentators. Energy, reactions, buzz - they got everything.   Ps, Philly's keeper is a disaster
Goated american football
And they say messi can't score from long range 😂 GOAT for a reason.
never seen Blake so out of position as he was  on those first two goals
King Messi❤
سخجف
Messi 🐐
-El portero más malo del mundo no existe..  - El portero del Philadelphia:
Messi's got his whole team feeling like all stars. And its working!
Every individual in Inter Miami became more than average players since Messi, Busi and Jordi joined. Wow!
to easy the goals , wtf messi goal was like a W pass in fifa =]
Wow! Messi Magic continues...long may it last!
Fácil
I really wish the MLS can succeed but maaaaaaan is the level low 😂
4:12 beginner difficulty on fifa
Surely it can't be long before USA becomes a really serious force at the World Cup?
Love❤ you Messi from India🇮🇳
this league is such a joke XDDDDD   you didnt even need to walk to score goals with player like busqets, alba, messi, martinez
On top of being the best, Messi has a passive aura called GOAT that increases the stats of everyone in his team by 50%
Messi hace lo que quiere con la pelota
"how do you like that Lionel Messi"?? What are you blabbering you stupid american commentator?!
Je trouve que Philadelphie on beaucoup raté malgré le score
Miami was lucky to get past FC Dallas.
❤
Jim curtain benching 4 of his starters.  Blake all of a sudden forgot how to play. This game was a fraud.
Calendar new Martinez
Amazing
Honestly this is way to low for messi qnd inter miami. I hope there is still sime tough teams out there who can make the game challenging a bit.
Jajajajajaja rayos pero que malos esos futbolistas jajajajaj
Messi 2022-2023 version is so underrated.  Honestly i love this version.  This messi can make a team like a warrior who ready to fight for his King. Like Argentina and now in Miami. GOAT.
Вратарь дырка полнейшая конечно 😅
wtf the golie doing?
So...this Messi guy might have a bright career ahead of him, no?
I'm still waiting for a tough game for I.M
OMG, was this a kindergarden match? Even I would catch that second goal and I am not a goalkeeper. :-D That was one of the most embarising goalkeepers moments I have ever seen.
Di Mana Ada Messi,Di Situ Ada Saya😂
😂 el portero es un chiste
Leo messi the Greatest ❤❤
They keeper for Philadelphia is awful
Messi GOAT ❤❤❤
these commentators are so bad wtf
Callender super Goalkeeper 🔥🔥💪
20'       Messiiii, What a goal from distance!  45+3'   And Messi's mate Jordi Alba has showed his class. What a goal by alba! চোখের শান্তি🥺❤️  Congratulations Miami for Leagues Cup Final match(MLS) for the First time. Congratulations Messi-Busquets-Jordi Alba❤️
Imagine playing in the obesity league at 35 Ronaldo was still scoring hat tricks in the UCL at that age😭
Philly's goalkeeper would be a joke also here in Hungary and our league is far from European top leagues. Anyway, it's great to see Messi and Alba enjoying the last years of their career in MLS. It's a very entertaining, spetacular league.
Philadelphia were prepared for Messi and busi but they forgot they got 9 more players to deal with
Im enjoy watching GOAT
Messi's effect on MLS is simply INSANE!
the opponent team doesnt bring the legs... lol
Easy Mode for Messi
Man. i feel like i'm watching some kids game
Philadelphia union's keeper is some waste. Conceding some cheap goals
Not fair Messi is two players!
MLS IS TERRIBLE LMFAO 😂😂😂😂💀💀💀🤡🤡
Philadelphia Union play like they would do better in a Sunday Football League
While Ronaldo, Neymar, Benzema let their legacies rot in Saudi Arabia, Messi, Busquets and Alba introduce football to America and strengthen the MLS in Europe. I stayed up til 3am yesterday to watch the match live and it was so worth it! Can't wait for the first US-raised talents to shake up the European market.
Callender is actually crazy
The MLS has been playing soccer… Messi, Busquets, and Alba brought Football to the states.
The pass at 1:20 was unreal, unfortunate that it didn't end in a goal.
Yeah, well, also, it is MLS after all. No need to get your knickers in a twist over the level of play.
This is match fixing. Look at the third goal. The number 5 didn't even try to block the pass
GOAT
I am actually better than the Philli keeper
Poor goalkeeping
cant get over the way the commentator says Jordi Alba 😂or the atrocious defending of mls teams love the enthusiasm though, good to see all the new football fans
Watching greatness? Messi is undoubtedly still a super player, but whoever lets in a shot like that from 30 yards out doesn't deserve to be called goalkeeper.
If this Messi kid keeps playing like this one of the big European teams might come in for him.
Messi is the goat, but even Americans can’t deny, the level that these goalkeepers are at are worse than UK Sunday league 😂😂😂
Philadelphia are shocking at finishing
Amazing messi & Amazing miami final  6 matches 9 goals 👑GOAT👑
🐐
Magic messi
La diferencia entre soccer y fulbo
Philadelphia Union gk is so bed
In the first match the Miami team couldn’t even keep their defensive shape they were so bad look at them now Messi’s presence is gonna force MLS teams to get better in order to survive. I mean the defenders in Jordi Alba’s goal are just painful to watch. But I’m sure they’ll learn soon enough.
Am I watching European women’s football or American men’s football
Wtf is goalkeeper doing?
No one gonna talk about how bad the GK of losing team was. He was so bad it made it seem like the game was fixed
Inter Miami who?? Up Seattle Sounders!!!
Touch down more like GOAL. Good try Union
Calender woke up and said, I am Prime Neuer !!!
Wow what was the keeper doing for Messi’s goal lol
"How do you like that Lionel Messi?" Why do these american commentators compare these "soccer" players to the Goat?
Wow
Leo , i am from Russia and i Love u!!!!!!!!)
The first goal, wow 😂 nice script
I’ve been a Barcelona fan since I was a young kid and I’m so glad to see these guys have a blast playing football and spreading that joy to their teammates. That’s how the sport is meant to be played.
He’s insane
Messi is the goat
4:07 - 4:30 cudownie mecz oddany dla inter Miami. Żeby w bramkę nawet nie trafić z tych akcji. Żałosne
MLS is the most entertaining league
Callender is fantastic❤️🔥
This Nashville team looks solid defensively with really fast attack up front. When Miami faced a really fast attack last time when they faced Dallas, their defense just crumbled and conceded 4 goals. How worried should I be of this Nashville team? Are they a legitimate threat?
Keeper is definitely MOTM right?
Kryvtsov 💪
MLS is scripted
American soccer 🤣🤣🤣
Saw it in stadium.
Philli fans taking photos of Messi goal against their team is just like taking photos of your wife with another much better looking man in your bed
An MLS highlight with 1mil view in just few hours? Messi effect
MLS now top 6 best soccer leagues in the world.
Messi 9 goals in 6 games Haters: Rigged or worst league in the world  People have to realize some people are just really good.  Remember when everyone said the EPL was the best league in the world and Haaland was going to find it difficult? Well Haaland scored 36goals, broke goal scoring records in a league that's suppose to be "the best in the world" and City went on to win a treble.  Some people are just really good, let's sit back and enjoy Messi's, Alba's and Bousquet's greatness. If MLS didn't invest in defenders, they'll have no choice but invest now.
great Messi, but this league needs to improve a lot. It's not even on the level of an Italian Serie D... goalkeeper and defenders totally out of position. Terrible
Absolutely awful play by Philadelphia's keeper. Professional keeper should not concede such goals. His level seems to be amateur
WHY MESSI'S FANS HATE RONALDO ,MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER IS SO MUCH EASIER THAN SAUDI LEAUGE 😡
Its fixed
GOAT is enjoying himself!
Its scripted
Since Messi has been in MLS, I've been watching the recaps as he seems to be in great shape again, but I can't avoid wondering if it always defends like this in this league. What a passive attitude!!! Nothing to do with European soccer!
У Филадельфии в воротах какой-то клоун стоит. У него, видимо, контракте написано "не пропускать мячи в ближний угол", другой причины я не вижу оставлять все время дальний угол открытым.😂
Oh my word. Who even are these philly players? I have seen better under 15’s team, absolutely horrendous 😂😂😂
MESSI MESSI MESSI🇦🇷❤💙
How bad is phila goalkeeper.
What a goal
Messi is one heck of a rookie...
❤❤❤Leo Leo Leo❤❤❤❤ One of The greatest player in football history ❤ Sooo blessed to be born in this era  To watch his match Let's go intermiami for the final 🎉
MLS is a joke with this kinda defending and goalkeeping
It seems like this keeper was told to allow in any ball that came to him
3 ex Barcelona players shows the difference between MLS and Europe :) They just came here to play.
Love the way Inter Miami team plays the game. Everybody gets involved. Sweet to see Jordi Alba's goal. Looking forward to the finals.
Messi from the distance!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Miss the match but won't miss the highlights 😊🎉
Messi is too good for MLS. He should be in Europe playing for Barcelona.
There’s something that hasn’t really been said because I think it’s too overwhelming to think about: we are witnessing the birth of a club. Inter Miami is only 5 years old, Messi made such an impact on this team already that it’s not a stretch to claim that he’ll be their biggest club legend. This is how I imagine it felt for people to watch Cruyff at Barcelona: he is at the center of this club’s rebirth. So exciting and amazing to witness, what a gift it is to be alive at the same time as Leo Messi.
liga mafia
People are so stupid if MLS is easy than you can first qualified your local league than domestic than national league than international 😂
0:32 Messi instructing Kryvstov to make that long pass.
I think Messi kicked the spin ball, because when the ball touching the ground, the ball becomes faster.
callander played just like prime Van Der Sar last night
Nda USA sok2 inggris deh palingan yg nonton sebagian besar dari indo
Just goes to show how poor the overall quality of the MLS is. All it took for Miami to go from bottom of the table to potential champions was Alba, Busquets and Messi at the end of their careers. Not taking away from any of their footballing abilities (they've all had amazing careers and are amazing players) Just think it highlights how poor the overall quality of the MLS is, especially the defending. Miami's defending was just as suspect as Philadelphia's imo.
Final match between MLS teams is the proof are ready to play CONMEBOL Libertadores
This is pathetic, either they are giving him the games or mls just straight up sucks and they need to get rid of these "boys" on these mls team and let men who want to win play. By the way, good job on missing a 40 yard goal Philly smh
Messi had an effect on the goalkeeper too, what a goalie
I know it’s mls but my lord the defending and keeper is terrible made it way to easy for Messi can’t do that when he on the pitch
Wow, Philadelphia's goalie is absolute trash. Incredible
Amateur league
Inter miami sekarang tidak terhentikan mengerikan 😮
that Messi goal is the kind of goals I score in FIFA 23
That messi goal, lol, the goat really play against close to the beginner level in mls
I guess Inter Miami forgot to change the Beginner difficulty
Месси Какашка !
What is this league? 💀
ABSOLUTE CARNAGE. ❤
Meu deus el arquero😮 para que te traje😂
Messi is the first and the goat
Gk from jnter impresses mw much but also messi goal
miami keeper is so good ngl
It seems he has got his smile back
Besides messi's performance , inter miami gk is just  🔥🔥
My jaw hit the floor when Messi scored from that spot. What a strike.
My first time ever watching a soccer anything 🔥
MESSI MELHOR DO MUNDO
Último puesto en la tabla 😮
Lol like Training for miami. The quality in this League is so bad lmao
Lionel theGOT oft all Times❤
messi ❤
Drake Callender does not get enough credit
It seems Ronaldo was right about MLS it looks junior league 😂😂😂😂 messi scoring from 32 meters.
Who is gonna beat this team? This Miami Team can play in the Premier League. They won’t be top, but they have enough pieces to compete.
Callender is World Class. He’s a prem level keeper for sure
That first assist by Kryvtsov.. 🔥🔥
🐐
Amazing 🎉🎉🎉🎉, you agree
Mess is doing what he does best
Messi is just like Kuroko in basketball.. He puts all his team mates in the Zone 😎🏀
the goalkeeper is so bad
Por estos videos sigo pensando que con 24 años si voy a la mls la rompo jaja
Yo, why Philadelphia players were so imprecise? Is that even common?
Such a great humbling as well 😊
I wonder if Americans are going to start watching more European football, given that almost retired players from Europe are having huge impact in MLS
The defenders just watch ball and do nothing,giving them so much space to operate,unlike any other league like spl is way much better than mls,they don't let any player to play so easily giving too much space.
the goalkeeping for philadelphia is absolutely shocking, bloke hasnt got a clue where his goal is lol
lol philadalpia team 😂  how toddler they are..  under 16 girls team alike.
Oh the goalkeeper !!! Bas level when you see «  real goalkeeper in Europe « 😂😂 It’s we compare basket-ball NBA with basket ball in Europe
Feel bad for the goalkeeper 🤣🤣
That Philadelphia Goalkeeper is trash 🗑️🚮
Good.job CALENDER
tbf as a Messi fan I think that Ronaldo would do the same
shitty gk😂
5:17 aint no way 😂😂😂
If you guys underestimate MLS team and will down to bottom level u're purely mistake. Wait until Inter Miami become champs and one of next contestant for FIFA CLUB WORLD CUP, then you will see how BIG IMPACT LM10 for American soccer...  Trust me, Messi not putting high level on himself but for overall MLS TEAM TO COMPETE ON HIM..
garbage this guy is no Pele or Maradonna these games are fixed to let Messi look good wow man scores from almost half Blake the best in Mls lets everygoal in they just want to see Messi in the finals
That goalkeeper is shambolic
The Only One 🐐
Philadelphia ha sprecato molte occasioni favorevoli.  Difensori in ritardo sulle azioni di attacco di Miami. Organizzazione della difesa da revisionare
Oh yeah baby ‘nother long range messi goal.
Barcelona West…. Messi…. Busquets… Alba….
The strikers and goalkeepers in the MLS are horrendous, lol a true farmers League
Gracias D Lowe ,😅 Philadelphia,
Messi playing in beginner mode 👽🙆🏻‍♂️🐐
i think Philla players love to play wwe more than football . Messi took the team abilities sky high
FC Dallas and Cruz Azul are more better opponents compare to Philly
Yo Robert Lewandowski looks amazing in the MLS!!!
I can't get over how terrible the MLS is bro  I really thought this league had at least gotten up to championship level over the last decade   This is meant to be one of the best teams   RIP
that Miami keeper is amazing
It is funny how they make it look like so hard and an important game this is for Messi. I mean this is and the MLS is a joke to hime
Mucho Phentanilo y poco futboll eehh, estos cringos no aprenden ajajajajajajaj 😂😂😂
“What can he not do,we’re watching greatness” 😢
Messi's first goal with a couple of defenders just watching him and Taylor's unending period with the ball in the midfield before Jordi's goal tells you how naive and almost amateur the level of football is in MLS. Messi is showing the world how mediocre the level of MLS is.
Messi is the best player in the world 🌎 Leo 🦁
Messe tá sobrando,joga muito👽🔥
GOAT EFFECT🎉🎉
Ok in mls there is no competition, they are completely screwed up, their defense is zero. But on the other hand, there are things that Messi shows and which absolutely do not depend on the quality of the team opposite. He's just too strong. When he is confident he does ridiculous things, just like at Barça even in 2021 for that matter, but in Paris we rarely saw him try these kinds of things and we said it's off when it's not
😲 that messi goal
Inter Miami wins this tournament and then probably goes on to make the playoffs and win the MLS this year...what a real joke!
the game more intense than past 2 3 year..i hope MLS can be a top league in uerope
MLS ain’t boring when Messi’s on the field, it’s like a fifa mobile game
@MLS please provide highlights without commentators removed (they are bad) and only crowd noise.
That 35 yard pee roller just goes to show Messi is the GOAT 🐐
They are just getting better and better!
Why is the Philly GK so bad
Callender was solid as always, Alba was magical once again, Busquets was really good, Taylor was decent aas well, Martinez looking great, Messi is Messi. I see the team winning the Leagues cup
❤😂😂😂😂
i am a messi fan but that philly keeper is having a bloody laugh !!!
I just love these commentators. Damn the energy
Drake Calendar 🥅🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hi everyone please GK haven't trained  well he  is anxious to see Messi in his first time need psychologist .😅
Philadelphia could have score more goals , but too bad their forwards are all yellow stats on finishing
Unions GK has no fucking idea how to position himself. He couldve saved the first and he shouldve saved the second one.
🤣🤣 sry but who can take this serious? It’s like Messi playing with kids. Horrendous defense! Poor quality compared to pretty much anything I saw from 1 division teams. Even Portuguese league is probably miles away
Messi playing with high school kids
Nice
Yeah he will do great in MLS but I can see no one remembers what Zlatan did in MLS
My grandfather will save that messi shot😂😂
❤❤❤Messi
WHAT A GOAL
What was the Philly centre back doing in that 3rd goal?! If he holds his line Alba is offside 🤦‍♂️
inter miami looks like they are playing beginners football(soccer) in a football(soccer) video game
Какой то постановочный матч. Пятилетний ребёнок успел бы сгруппироваться под такие мячи. Вратарь будто уворачивался от мячей. Кино
Philadelphia is hilariously bad
Stardet to watch mls since the GOAT went over there
And they said he can’t score long shots.
Now THIS is football.
They didnt lose after messi came right? Thats crazy
let's win the final too 😍😍
GOOAALLLAASSOOOO ⚽ 9TH GOAL ⚽ FOR LIONEL MESSI 🔥👏🏾👍🏾 AND JORDI ALBA SCORED A GOAL⚽🔥👍🏾 IN THE SAME MATCH TOO👍🏾 WHAT A FUTBOL REUNION ⚽W FOR INTER MIAMI, TO THE FINALS THEY GO🔥👍🏾
Messi has transform this team to the one he was during his days at FC Barcelona 🤥
Philiy’s GK soo bad lmao 😅
Inter Miami is a monster too cos I noticed his hunger to keep clean sheets and better himself which is having a positive impact on his performance on the pitch
Does messi already speak english?
is the commentator watching soccer or boxing? "youve got to PUNCH the opponent IN THE FACE!"
MLS level is too low
those goals dont mean anything in this league look at the fkn goalkeeper, hes playing against amateurs in this joke league
It's DELIGHTFUL to wake and know the GOAT and his team had won🎉😌☺️🇬🇭 Go for Gold 🥇 Inter💪
кипер молоток
Ku Sali nabigayna the best person ever the most knowledge able and the most shine all created prophet mohamed (salalaahu caleehim wasalim)❤❤❤❤
Philadelphia's whole team is just pathetic. That's the word. Not just bad, but laughable. It was physically painful to watch. Keeper just standing there as a furniture, attackers see the ball for the first time in their lives and don't know how to hit it properly. Just pay attention to what keeper was doing during second goal 🤣🤣🤣 I can GARANTEE you that if someone in my neighbourhood during football match would concede goal like this, he would be out of everyones team for at least 1 month. Holy wow, that's one the most ridiculous teams I have ever seen in my life.
Messi Effects 🇧🇩💖
2 minutes of stoppage time when literally 15 mins of rolling around had happened. But when the MX teams play and are winning they give +10 stoppage time. It's crazy.
Looks like the match was staged. Terrible defending all over. Maybe the players were tired before the first half ended. Shambolic defending
The whole team has gotten better by playing with Messi. It’s amazing what the presence of one player can do!
بتحس انو بس انتر الفريق العادي عفوا ميامي يلي بالملعب مباراة الدوري السوري اقوى منها ميسي المتخاذل 😂
Football in the US is a joke lol. No defense pressure no nothing. I think Ronaldo is right about the Saudi league being better than the MLS
Bro and this was the last team in MLS league imagin what would of happen if Messi would of join a better team. That would of been insane 🤯🤯
inter miami goalkeeper was so busy today, not even a single holiday for Callender
Messi my idol❤..36 and still the best ..
PSG fans hating every minute of it . . France SUc*s
‏‪0:43‬‏
A.blake is the worst goalkeeper I have ever seen. Even in the captains series on Netflix, that dude is the most average goalkeeper I have seen.   Idk what teams see in A.blake
Callender is going to Europe
Philadelphia goal keeper was not focus this game.
Phil Neville built this team....
blake was awful wtf
What is this GK positioning from Philadelphia Union. It's so much worse that messi just tap the ball from the outside the box
MESSI​ THE GOAT. 💖
🐐
❤❤❤Messi❤❤❤
I know messi is probably the best player ever but tbh MLS is so bad , they don't have tactics  , their defence easy to go through, no pressure on players and also most of the players can't hit the target in realy easy opportunities, that's why it's called soccer not football in US bc they really suck on it
Messi goat...
Inter Miami's match is more entertaining than PSG
We love pessi
Andre Blake had a mare in this game.
1:19 what a pass that was 🔥
Messi king of football
porque oparece que la pelota resbale tanto
I like how some idiots are saying it’s the MLS! Like we don’t know and here you came to watch it anyway!!
Josef Martinez is just like a look alike to Messi and squarez in Barca much love here ❤❤
Somewhere somehow the Union defenders looks so ametuer, all their performance. Looks scripted, Holywood style. Wrexham wannabe influenced.
philadelphia’s goalkeeper is trash
Lionel Messi is going to play a new final, hopefully I can say this all my life, I don't care where I play.  As long as he is there we will all be much happier.
Terrible Philly keeper
Let’s be honest for us Messi fans this is way more enjoyable than the PSG games of the last 2 seasons… we just want to see Messi shine
Messi playing against kids 😂😂😂
nevermind Messi or how good Inter Miami attacks are-- that keeper was just a bit shite
Where is the defense of Philadelphia? 😅
Just imagine messi and roonaldo both goats win the league cup. 💀💀😱😱😱😱
I have two words different gravey
easy league 😂😂😂
Messi, Alba and Busquets have transformed that team prior to their arrival they hadn't won a game in over a month since Messi' arrival they are unbeaten
PU’s goalie needs to train his ready stance and positioning 😅
I wonder who's actually happy... Inter Miami fans or MLS fans...
Phila goalkeeper.........
GOAT = Lionel Andres Messi
It's crazy what belief does to a team. Only GOAT level players can immediately increase the level of play and expectation of an entire organization. Saw this with Lebron James going back to Cleveland. Tom Brady's 1st year in Tampa. And now with Messi with Inter Miami. The WORST team in the league to the favorites in just two WEEKS. Insane
See that second goal  Fucking useless league
Callender man of the match,what a performance!
I startet crying of hapyness
El portero del philadelphia , de verdad es portero???😂😂😂😂
Philadelphia ten que mudar o goleiro
Every player on Miami is on 99 confidence right now. Messi has  made them all so much better.
What a goal 👏 😳 👌
🐐🇦🇷🔥
That Inter Maimi Goalie "Drake Callendar" is something else 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Callendar so good
Look at messi closely in the first tells the player to go long and look what happens. Football brain
GOAT
Mls Barcelona
Rất vui khi Messi đến MLS. Do có con nhỏ nên mình không thức khuya được, cảm thấy may mắn vì đỡ phải coi highlight mà được coi trực tiếp luôn. Bàn thắng quá đẹp và bất ngờ.
Martinez 1 gol bello e il 2 gol si messi una meraviglia !!!!! Woooow
@ 1:15  Philly  goalie was smiling after Messi scored 🤣
These league is a joke 😅😅😅😅
Comentary: number then
compare this to other MLS YT vids with less than 90k views lmao
1:38 He’s done it again!!
what a garbage goalkeeper
Worst LB I've ever seen
1:35 imagine to be Martinez and can´t see that goal ´cause you are in the floor
This wouldn't be possible in the English Premier League
All whole my life I cheer on the Inter Miami🧁
That’s the dirtiest tackle I’ve seen in professional football in a long while lmao
I swear this looks like playing FIFA on easy mode
메시는 엄청나다
Inter Miami absolutely on 🔥🔥🔥
Germany‘s 4th Division > MLS
messi messi messi he is at the heart of this club but man if bekham sells calendar i think inter miami will stay as a bottom league club
messi messi messi he is at the heart of this club but man if bekham sells calendar i think inter miami will stay as a bottom league club
tambien ese portero parece coladera
Messi's a joy to watch
Phili players were a bit too selfish
I ❤ messi
Love watching MLS get exposed!
The ball seems really big or heavy.
That’s one of the best saves I’ve seen, incredible!
how is this a professional league? i was born in the wrong country. if I was a us citizen, I would be playing pro for sure
Feels like I'm watching a WWE match, with their fake beatdowns. Only difference is, they're not skilled enough for a football team, so they're allowing the Miami team to win since they can't do any better.
I am sorry but what am seeing is bs, major league soccer feels scripted. Defenders scoring own goals and now the weakest shot from 32 meters goes in. I am done for real.
Philadelphia needs a new goalkeeper obviously
At 3:39 the numeber 5 was trying to defend the ball telepathically?
The way robert Taylor playing reminds me of pedri
Union made to the top ladder with that abysmal Goalkeeper? World been too harsh on Karius.
That Philadelphia's goalkeeper  is far too generous
I love Messi ❤ incredible how he changed not only his team but the league!! Aside from that this Philadelphia team was disastrous, the defense was non existent the whole game
I hope the Philadelphia goaltender will one day be taught to take the right position in the net, not to open a very far corner and come forward to reduce the angle of the shot. 😉
Messi, Alba and Busquets is not fair for every other MLS Team. Cheatcode acvtivated
1:47 messi cold❤😢😮
Go go go inter miami
Messi is too good
Look at that first goal. Amateur league.
nah bro 3 of my favourite players scoring long goals in the mls?
O nível do futebol nos EUA tá subindo muito, parece Champions League! Acho que na próxima copa EUA vai surpreender
The defending is appalling the games so open. would be interesting to see any prem team vs a mls side
Inter Miami's keeper just keeps getting better!!!! Messi the whole team is looking good...
Philadelphia is so mean. They had like 20 fouls. Were they trying to kick the ball or kick people??
Both defenses are so incredibly bad it hurts my eyes. Thats sunday league football with some elderly superstars having the time of their lives with no effort whatsoever
Кривцов 👍
It's nice to see Messi do well, but my god the American league sucks.
If neymar  came  to that league he will play with them like toddlers lol
It's great that Messi is very happy 😍
Goat messi❤
We are watching greatness!!! He did this very easily in Europe, America soccer is actually good... Enjoying watching MLS
A high press system could do wonders in the MLS. So many players are just free to take their first touch and look around.
goalkeeper made a  mistake not  doing 2 step more to his left because ball was going wider
Goalkeapers are so bad....
I missed that initially. The opening goal was messi creation. He filled space pulling a defender and ask the attention on him. He signaled to his teammate when to make the play
Messi boosts his whole teams performance and morale by 3x
Go inter miami
wow, what a game!
Defenders from Wish
Rigged league
This is fun to me
Bedoya’s goal was an unreal finish. Gotta give him that credit. I want to see Miami in league play
And then they say MLS is better than Saudi league 😂😂😂😂 are you kidding me the mistakes they make here are embarrassing wtf
Poor defense and finishing by Philla
Really strong saves from callender this match!
We hope Inter Miami will win in the final
What's wrong with this shitty Philadelphia goalkeeper? Is this women soccer?
I love watching the mls, but the quality of how they play is worse than I thought.
Having watched both now, it's shocking how much worse MLS play is compared to the Saudi league
2:54 that goal from Jordi Alba is the same goal he scored against Italy in the Euro 2012 final.
that callender guy is insane
Lawak League anjer wkwkwk 😂
This cannot be playing inter Miami it took only one man to make it eternal Miami 😮
0:29 Caminando te arma la jugada. 🐐
Messi is teaching US some soccer
Кривцов красава, гольовий пас
What if messi came to inter miami from the start of the season.Will intermiami in 1 postition?
Ronaldo won Europe and went on for Saudi but Messi conquered Europe, the world and now both the American continents.
Messi showing his magic to take his team to final
Messi effect🐐👑
3 key players from Barcelona has done it once again
I'm curious how the commentator reacts when a really good play happens.
Farmer league
Messi is Perfect...
congrat to final miami
Philly had plenty of chances they couldn’t convert
What's wrong with the Goal keeper ..
this leag is really weak
The keeper just made Messi look good. That was too easy. The keeper does not deserve to play at all
This boy Messi has a big future, could get a big money move with these performances
Messi Takes His Team To Final Magical GOAT 🐐
2.5 lakh views in just one hour of uploading. People are literally watching MLS because of Messi.
Callender became prime Neuer
"They have been the most consist..." 0-2 after 20'
the philadelphia GK is soooo bad, I've never seen that. But glad to see Messi is happy here
the gk kinda sucks
Whoever is writing these scripts for Messi since 2021 has saved my life 😂❤
usually he's not shooting from this distance..I guess he figured out that the goalkeepers are much weaker in this league.
Lionel Messi goal was his farest goal I’ve ever seen
Goalkeeper masterclass! What saves he did!
Was john cena the goal keeper for phily?
Messi´s impact in the MLS is crazy, every team mate around him turn into best players, even rival teams i would say.
Messi walks in MLS😂
Gerardo Martino is the happiest coach in this World
какой отскок
That‘s some of the worst defensive play ever
*A ouais le deuxième but c terrifiant... Avec tout l'respect mais là y'a mm pas d'effort.*
should be 3-4. Phi wasted so many goals.
💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Good stuff by Miami for sure, but also insanely poor defending by Philly. The first 3 goals is a total joke.
Insane 🐐
Also die Torhüter in den USA sind aber auch anders schlecht :D
Goalkeeper sleeping
MESSSI THE GOAT!!! O MY GOD
6:30 I heard siuuuuu
messi goat🎉
I've never watched so many MLS games in my life 😂
What a match !
Match fixing
The greatest scenes of match fixing I've ever seen...these guys can't be that bad💀
they had the reactants and got the perfect catalyst as messi,amazing energy,chemistry,everyone is at their best,the saves from callender were bravo and now the product will hopefully be a win in the final,if not,it was a great effort and journey
Philadelphia should've have won
Lmao. “BIMBO” written on the philly jerseys
Just one player bro 😂
That keeper from Philadelphia liked to dive in slowmotion and his positioning wasn’t good that game
As much as I like what I see here, its fair to say MLS is lacking some quality. On one hand Messi scored his longest-distance goal in his career, but what I saw was bad goaltending. Frist goal same issue, the goalie went too close to the near post. Third - goal lack of pressure to allow a killer pass behind defense.  Compared to saudi league - as funny as that may sound - MLS is slower and less physically demanding. Also if you take into a count that three "retired" world class players turn a club 180degs around, going from table bottom into not coming close to losing a single game speaks how much quality difference there is. However, I think it will necessarily raise awareness of entire league as a need to improve on every aspect of the game, especially its tempo. But one can not blame someone else for giving people so much joy by playing the beautiful game so I thinks its fine. In my opinion MLS is in a much healthier habitat to grow than Saudi league, but Saudis  have a lot of money and arguably a head start so we shall see how its gonna look like in 5-10-15 years - maybe some day champions league will grow overseas (one way or the other) , fingers crossed.
It's hard to believe, the team that was at the bottom of the standing turned into a monster in just 2 weeks
*_Messi Mania🎉_*
Nah....say what you will. This got to be the poorest league ever. Credit to Inter Miami but damn!!! The fucking hell is that defence. Horrific. Pathetic. Shiet man.
Seit wann spielt Delay Spirts MLS
Cool🎉
I'm a fans of Messi, and now become new fans of MLS
The goalkeeper was also great...what a tournament the Miami players is have because of the Goat arriver...Lionel Messi🤗🤗🤗
Tbh a goalkeeper in Europe leagues would deny that far away goal from messi
Ok. There must have been a force field shielding that Inter Miami goal. Some of those misses were just insane
Some very suspect goalkeeping from philly
It's was like watching Michael Jordan team playing against high school kids team...men amongst boys
Taylor when he's not under guilty pressure always give decent perform as support character imo.  And Calender getting really enjoyable to watch!   Good luck for the final!
You will never get me to understand why a men’s teams need to have their kit be pink though I guess it is America after all.
THERE'S NO STOPPING THEM 💪🏼
Defensively this league is almost laughable….
Messiiiiii<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Do Inter Miami have plot armour or something? Their opponents just somehow never score their chances
🐐
Tiki taka trio ...
Before Messi busquets and alba inter Miami was one of the worst MLS team but now they can win the mls
Barcelona boys bullying the mls😂
I'm the type of guy to rewind highlights to see if Messi got the assist 👀
That pass though 1:20 💀
Wow, philly are a horrible team 😂
Only the brilliant Messi possesses the power to utterly revolutionize a team that languished at the bottom of the standings just a month ago, propelling them to the pinnacle of reaching the final.
Goat 🐐 Messi 👏👏
Philadelphia's GK footwork and positioning needs some work
Some of Philadelphias misses were criminal
Philadelphia's keeper is not even good enough for 3rd division English football...
4:08 shows you why mls is such a terrible league
Goal keeper deserves a clean sheet😢
🐐🐐
Tutti gasati per le prestazioni di messi, ma ricordatevi che è mls e non i top 5 campionati al mondo, basta solo guardare quante palle sbagliano e quanti passaggi a vuoto. Svegliatevi
that ref giving Messi advantage even tho Martinez was faulted, underrated af.
Goal keeper was expecting Messi to take on the defenders but no.....   He activates saitama: on kick man version 😂
these defenses gotta learn how to play offside oml
Messi's celebration on way Spider-Man in m.y ch.ann.el 🥰
5:00 funny how they cut off that sentence 😂😂😂
The quality of the MLS is shocking. I felt like I was watching League One for the majority of this. If not for Messi, Alba and Busquets, I'd probably even say the Vanarama National League! haha
Nah bro, this league Cup is scripted. First 2 goals could have been easily avoided.
they say philadephia Union Is Undefeted And Favorite in this Cup..  But Messi say Nope. 😅
Messi ❤
1:17 what a pass by Wagner. Honestly one of most astonishing passes i have seen in my live😲 and I say that as a 37 year old guy living in Germany and growing up with european football.. The MLS is WAY underrated man...
MESSI!!!!!🐐🐐🐐🐐
,
Callender is good
Feel like the game to a certain extent is rigged for Miami to win this season after the Messi and busquets move
what a plastic-league
Scripted match
That keeper …
Such a poor quality league. Messi will run riot
Gosh… I’m French, looking every days European football (or soccer, as you prefer), the gap between the MLS and all the European league is huge… you gonna see a magical Messi for sure, this is too easy for him
I think there is nothing more to say: Leo is devastating the MLS. Simply the best. ❤
Philie were woeful.
After Messi's debut 2-1 win, Inter Miami always scores four in every match they play
Congrats Messi , Martinez and the team Inter Miami
this league is poor
It's rigged 😂😂😂
wwe wtf??
Блять, МЛС и то лучше чем РПЛ
Philadelphia keeper wouldn’t even cut it in league two
rubbish league tbh 😁
Wtf is wrong with Philadelphia gk??? His positioning is terrible
Messi i walking through this sunday league.  Man City would walk over Philadelphia Union maybe 15- 0
God Messi
i think MLS could be in top 5 worst league after watching some matches.. our school team GK is way more better than MLS best GK 🤣
How many times he is going perform those magic.
NA football is the funniest man
These American commentators are too funny😭😭 another player scores messi aint got nun to do with it (its his own teammate by the way) “how do you like that messi”
That blue goalie did not know where to position himself..........
Terrible keeping for that Messi goal, that Philly keeper got punished for his positioning.
The Defense is horrible in the mls.
Just got a Tide commercial after the video. It said “Life is messy”.  Perfect timing.
"What can he not do". Run? haha
The GOAT
God, American commentators are cringy as hell
Inter Miami > al nassr. Borussia Dortmund 🤝 Inter Miami
У Филы не вратарь,а дыра какае-то!
defenses in MLS are basically inexistent
Pazzesco Messi. Finalmente un club che lo tratta da migliore del mondo ancora vivente e in attività. Grazie Inter
i am miami fan but Philadelphia played well  and missed so many chances i think they deserve a point atleast...
Ronaldo CAN HAVE The Goat Status! this is the Futbol God. 2 entirely different levels of lifting..
This shows how weak MLS and concacaf is compared to everyone else.
lol the level in the MLS is a joke
Messi, alba ans busi just toying in the mls
I watched this and saudi league, this is 10x worse than Saudi league look on the 2nd goal keeper let it roll in lol wheres the shame of playing in this league if your under 30
The defense in the MLS Is ridicolous. Messi can play with slippers 😂😂
ROFL what a joke of a league omg this is hilarious!!!
Messi could win the trophys with inter Miami Leagues Cup US Open Cup MLS cup ( main) and the Supporters Sheid And they could play Concaf champions cup in next year
Philadelphia can't defend ☠️ there keeper was sus but that Miami keeper is brilliant ig Philadelphia can't shoot, missing 2 sitters
ภาพโครตสวยคับ❤🎉
Which trash can did they find this keeper
The quality of player in MLS is actually shocking
Happy for messi but mls teams are so trash 😂 they leave soo much space in between the lines, no pressure at all, they’re making it so easy for messi
Messi has gone to MLS not only to turn the MLS upside down. But also to change "Soccer" into Football
Messi might score 91 again this season. 😂 Defensive play looks very poor across MLS teams. No one: sticks to their man; blocks passing lanes; checks over their shoulders or maintains defensive shape. It’s like every team only plans to score 🤦🏽‍♂️
😅😅😅😅
The goalkeeper for Philadelphia. Come on.
the 2nd goal was a joke!😂
O Philadelphia pipocou.
😮😮
It doesn't amazes anymore on how Messi elevates his team-mates performance in Inter Miami, since he has being doing the same for ages at Barcelona, Argentina and even at PSG.
5:53 - Americans copy the song STEAUA BUCHAREST ( FCSB )
messi effect is insane from a team that had a lot of loses before he arrived
🥰🥰🥰🥰
He'll end the season with 80 goals
This league is so easy for him
Messi is the GoAT but let’s be honest the quality of MLS is pretty poor. Before Messi was playing against men, now he is playing against boys and it’s showing
What is that defending though?  Wouldn't even pass for Scottish Championship level...
hahahahaha americans just don't know how to comment a football game... "This is criminal"
Messi League Soccer
Bro am I the only one who thinks that this match was scripted 🤔🤔
This league is the same as women Football, real trash. For Messi, Alba and Busquets this is training
Kryvtsov's assist in the first goal is just the highlight of the game!
Goat
This championship is a joke hahahaha 😂
It's bad when even your fans can't help but cheer on an opponent because he is just too good
if my keeper would position himself like this in a video game, I'd instantly turn my console off
1:20 this pass tho
Callender to Chelsea is Here we go !!! Toddy Bolly wants the keeper to replace Kepa !!!!
Wtf is the goalie doing?
What an easy league to play in no tackles just room to do what you please
With Messi, all the opponents teams are psychologically dead in the MLS. We are habituated to it☠️This guy is not from our planet earth 😂he comes to colonize us 😂
Glad to see Messi happy again, doing and enjoying what he loves the most while promoting Soccer in the USA at the same time. Soccer will flourish and become a top sport in the US thanks to him and the seeds that were planted by many others in the past throughout the years,  he is gonna definitely make soccer popularity skyrocket in the USA for ever. Nobody on this planet including Pelé and Maradona contributed to this sport like Messi did and keeps doing.  Over 20 years playing at top level and keeps going. The most awarded player in history: 42 Titles that includes 10 La Liga, 4 Champions, 3 World Clubs, 1 World Cup sub-20, 1 Finalissima, 1 Olympic Gold Medal, 1 Copa America and 1 World Cup. Over 50 personal Awards that include 7 Golden Ball, 6 Golden Boots, 8 Pichichis LaLiga, 9 MVP LaLiga, 6 times best Champions scorer. 15 Personal records that include best scorer in one natural year with 91 goals and best scorer ever in one season with 50 goals LaLiga. He is definitely the G.O.A.T
I just want to thank the Major League Soccer channel for not putting the score in the title or thumbnail. For some reason all the European and UK highlights do that, and it makes it so much less exciting to watch the highlights. I keep coming back for Inter Miami highlights! Thanks again, it really makes a difference!
thank you mls for the thumbnail❤
Al nassr vs Inter Miami??
The impact Messi has on the opponent as well. The amount of shots Philladelphia was sending into the stratosphere was comical.
For a moment there I thought I was watching Barca! Then the cameras zoom out and shows the tiny stadium. Messi looks like he's still enjoying football. I don't even watch the MLS but am glad that Youtube recommended this video to me. Loved it!
Goalkeeper Is a joke
This is like watching play station .. how good are they😅
" you need to stop Lionel Messi" bro like people havent tried for decades
Embarrassing leage so bad defense lol!
From Malaysia, been watching wc, premier league, seria A and la liga for more than 20 years, hafta say MLS is catching up to europe, And the commentators have stepped up massively.... kudos to the organization
Inter Miami vs Nashville SC in the final!!!
My grandmother is better than the goalkeeper
Pantes aja messi msh bagus,pemainnya kek gini🤣
Al nasr better club and can beat inter miami....😊
im pretty sure ppl would "flame" ronaldo too for the easy goalkeeper. if anyone ever would watch saudi i mean xD
It’s crazy how bad the MLS level is, what in the world is that defense? They’re awful!
I take nothing away from Inter Miami, but my goodness teams in MLS really need to improve their defending sense.
Miami The New Barca- Only Ramos Needed In Defence 😢- the messi busquets alba coaching and tactics ar effective on the pitch- look at dallas and philedelphia match its clearly evident of progress🎉
I realised a while ago that MLS standard is poor especially when high performance players in Europe crossover. Even Carlos Vela was scoring goals for fun and was considered a top strker in MLS until Zlatan came and just showed how much of a difference there is.   Also when Bradley Wright Phillips was also scoring for fun lol. Not to say they are bad strikers, but they both didnt make the cut in the Englis Premeir league.   So there was no doubt that it would be a walk in the park for Messi. Easy work for him. I am also sure it would have been the same for Ronaldo if he went to MLS.
Yo
It’s crazy how huge the spaces are that the forwards get here compared to European leagues. 🤯
Bro how much was Blake paid to play like this 💀
the positioning of the Philadelphia keeper is atrocious
🇬🇧  Lionel Messi  what does it feel like being dressed up like a " Girls Blouse "  .
Dude Messi on MLS is not fair but Philly was straight garbage that game. Keeper had two challenging but getable saves missed and the countless chances where Philly made the worst of good opportunities was tragic
The best player of the year ❤❤❤
Honestly who can stop Inter Miami at this point?
4:04 perfectly explains how Philly played this game...congrats to Miami they played well and Philly did not...
The Goat ❤❤❤
Goal Keeper are so average in this league
wtf are these goalkeepers doing in the MLS, unbelievable lmao
Inter Miami is  on a winning spree i wonder how 🤔😂
Miamis keeper is 🔥
Inter has that one coach that’s always smiles like „I can’t believe this is happening to us“ whenever messi scores 😂
У филодельфии на воротах чей то батя стоит?
Melhor de todos os tempos
Inter Miami before Messi  22 matches 22 goals  With Messi  6 games  21 goals
Снйчас наверное все молодые таланты в Америке хотят оказаться в инетер маими.   😊
King Leo
I’ve seen more mls than Saudi league, but they’ll still say Saudi league is better than the MLS…….The Messi effect in my recommended feed.
that goalkeeper is shocking
mls is so bad
Philadelphia's midfield and goalkeeper (first two goals) had a terrible first half.  Great third and fourth goal from Miami.  I wonder if opponents need to bring the old school one-on-one to shut down Messi. Just a tough midfielder that shuts down Messi, as in the 80s the ones that remind you the even on the next day.  Way way too easy. High pressure and fitness is required to shut down playmakers, otherwise Miami has too many time to cook a decent attack
Messi :  Hey, goalie keeps going to his right, oh well, shoot to the left.
Who knew the MLS was this entertaining?? We thank Messi for exposing us to this league! GOAT Stuff!!!!
why are those players not pressing and roaming around casually?
Messi give100% opportunity to all team
Why Philadelphia play without goalkeeper and forwards
Hãy nhìn xem JM lấy lại tự tin và mở tỷ số. Đó là lý do tại sao GOAT nhường đến 2 quả pen cho cậu ta. Chứ cậu ta chơi bên cạnh fake goat là có khi hủy hoại cả sự nghiệp như Maguire, đã tâm lý rồi nó còn gây sức ép tranh dành quyền lực, đòi lấy băng đội trưởng, gây bè kết phái cô lập, cà khịa , châm chọc cộng thêm lũ fan hùa trên mạng.....cả đống lý do đánh sập 1 cầu thủ giỏi. JM cũng vậy, đang là cây săn bàn số 1 đội, biết là vị thế Messi ở trên quá xa nhưng vẫn chạnh lòng, tâm lý đâm ra rất nhiều hệ lụy sau đó, ở đâu mới tới lấy hết của mình....nhưng không, đây là GOAT , REAL GOAT 🇦🇷🦙🌏 trong truyền thuyết chứ ko phải hàng fake ích kỉ, đạo đức giả kia. Nếu muốn biết chính xác nghĩa của từ HIỆU ỨNG, NÂNG TẦM thì nhìn vào Miami những trận cầu vừa qua là chính xác nhất. Cậu ta nâng tầm cả giải đấu, bóng đá là môn xếp chót bẹt ở Mỹ giờ nóng sôi sùng sục, ở bất cứ clb nào cũng vậy ko riêng gì Miami, giá vé tăng khủng khiếp, clb năn nỉ c đv nhà đừng bán vé của mình vì lợi nhuận quá cao, nước Mỹ chưa bao giờ như vậy với bóng bầu dục, bóng rổ chứ đừng nói bóng đá. Mỗi trận cầu có Messi bán vé bằng doanh thu nữa năm trc đó khi GOAT chưa đến . MLS đc cả thế giới dõi theo ko khác gì mấy giải đấu lớn, sợ bây giờ còn hơn L1 của Pháp. Tất cả những gì xung quanh đều đc hưởng lợi. Taylor cầu thủ vô danh giờ ko khác gì Lewandowski phiên bản Mỹ , 1 bức hình 2k like của cậu ta giờ 200k like chỉ vài phút....nhiều cái để kể lắm. Đó chính xác là HIỆU ỨNG,NÂNG TẦM chứ ko phải bỏ cả đống tiền trả mức lương gấp 5, gâp 10 lần phá giá để lôi kéo rồi gọi là hiệu ứng của người này người kia. Mls chỉ cần 1 Cầu thủ mà từ chối h đ 1 tỷ 6 2 năm rưỡi của Arah giờ gây chú ý vang dội hơn cả một đống cầu thủ Arah đem về. Tuy Arah gây tiếng vang nhưng ko bằng Mls hiện tại. Ở giải đấu mà celeb hàng đầu thế giới nhiều vô kể đến xem GOAT thi đấu. Một clb mà ở dưới đáy xh thắng nhiều trận liên tiếp với số bàn thắng khủng khiếp hiên ngang vài ck. Nói thật chứ thua trận bk này cũng thành công ngoài mong đợi rồi nhưng GOAT còn làm nó nhiều hơn thế nữa.  Tất cả những gì từ sút phạt, chạy chỗ đỡ ngực vole, chân trái , chân phải , sút xa , đệm bóng cận thành....GOAT cho nguoi Mỹ chiêm ngưỡng tất cả, đa phần trong đó là quyết định chứ ko phải chờ đồng đội phục vụ ngay mõm, giật pen...rồi làm đủ trò lố ăn mừng. Đéo nghĩ gì đến cảm giác đồng đội xung quanh.  Đá cái giải mà 4 clb mạnh nhất của 1 chủ thì đá con mẹ gì, đố clb nào khác vô địch đc ngoài băng tụi nó. 11 ct Al Narls đá, Hilal còn thắng chứ 10 người. Ko phải đc lệnh ở trên xuống phải thua vì Al Narls có media player dễ làm truyền thông hơn hả. Thử nghĩ Mc, Mu , Arsenal và Liverpool cùng 1 chủ ở NHA còn mấy clb còn lại đa số dưới đáy xh thì đá cái gì nũa, nhưng nó có thật ở giải Arah đó, giải mà có ct nói sẽ lọt top 5 thế giới trong vài năm nữa. Chuyện thật như đùa         Bl này ta spam qua mọi video nói về GOAT, vì tao thích vậy
Calendar was the goat in this match
That miss at 4:11 is just something else😢😂
I''ve watched all Miami games since Messi's move. It's been entertaining so far, but this one turned me off... Awful football!
Mls is so sihit bro .. look at their defense 😂 , They’re playing soccer bro not football😂
Messiiiiiiii 🐐 goosebumps 🔥
Not to undermine messi goal but the positioning of the keeper at that moment 🤦
They just didn't want to score 😅
First and second goalkeepers goal.
ヤギのメッシ🐐とラクダのペンデュ🐪
Its fun to watch but this league is so weak
Messi!!! Messi!!! Messi!! Messi!!
When I looked at the philadelphia guy run back after equalising one I was stuck wondering what he was feeling like😂😂😂
Terrible Keeper 🤣🤣 Komplett fehlerhaftes Stellungsspiel
Everybode hates Philly
this league is so bad bro. that messi goal should've never been a goal. he just make yall look silly bruh
Bruhh american commentators are cringe
Bro Miami looks like they are on steroids in MLS
Deary me this is like League One quality
Aint no way this league is not scripted 💀
Bro i swear the 8th tier german league is better than the mls😂😂
Messi🔥🔥🔥
4:25 what a save😮
That Philadelphia Goalkeeper showed some of the worst professional keeping I've seen in my life...
Messi has turned Inter Miami into a EPL team, they are playing like Man City. They are making every other MLS team look like crap.
Tata Martinez is a great coach. The goal keeper was exellent and helped Miami keep the momentum going on. Philly should think twice about their defencive failures, a lot of miscommunication, people standing behind the line and thus conceiding at least 2 goals that easily should have been offsides.
4:11 easy goal why he miss
Messi league soccer
Anyone knws who is the mom?
3:38 no.5 didn't even react. he just watched the ball roll right past him.
Barbie league
I feel like Philadelphias goalie is not positioned well in any of these goals, thats why they take the shot and place it out of his reach easily
Messi is the best
MESSI 🐐🇦🇷
Dude Miami has become Barcelonas happy retirement home and I freaking love it 😂
Goalkeeper on fire 💥 inter
Unions defense is terrible
That’s such a slow shoot by messi. That goalkeeper couldn’t even stop that 😭
How tf did the keeper not get that first goal Jesus 😂
This Taylor guy is also shining 😢
4:20 That save by Callender is WORLD CLASS. Talk about Messi shining but that is just phenomenal.
messi vs McDonald's workers
Messi is just,wow❤
I think the term 'putting pressure on an opponent' is still unknown in the MLS.
Miami 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
MLS- Defence is a joke, far too easy
Lionel Messi is the undisputed king of football. There are no two like him. That those who agree put a like and follow me
crazy
“How do you like that, Lionel Messi?” I mean, come on, Messi is the one who decides the fate of MLS today.
Nice keeper 😂😂😂
@3:24 Someone needs to learn how to play offside
I guess south African league is better than mls after seing those goals....anyshot on target is likely a goal
4:23 damn what a save
Messi is playing Fifa on his ps5 on Miami , Great football matches , you can see his happiness , enjoying like a kid , made the best choice to go to Miami 🫡🫡🫡
That keeper is wack
Impressive Miami,  on the other hand, Philly has a terrible defence and even worse keeper! Goal 1 and Goal 2. Poor goalkeeper positioning.   3rd goal,  Taylor allowed too much space and time on the ball.
Just give the cup to Messi already lmao. Messi really avoided all the real strong teams again like he did at the World cup and played vs probably the worst teams (excluding FC Dallas) to get to the final 😂 didn't get to play Tigers, LA FC, Monterey, or any real potential threat.
Npc league🤣🤣🤣
That second goal ,what is the keeper doing lol
3:20 what in the world is this defense? looks like 7th tier english football
Simplemente NON PLUS ULTRA !!! ❤💪
what do you guys think the defenses's level in the MLS compares to? Regionalliga in Germany? League Two in England? Its obviously way lower than the average offensive quality in the MLS
In Deutschland  🇩🇪  ist  das  kreisliga  nieveu was ist das für  ein  Torwart  garkein stellungspiel nichts   wie  kann  man so  ein  im  Tor 🥅  stellen
Let be honest here. I'm a messi fan but these teams make it too easy for messi wtf!!😂 they give him too much space . They don't even know how to cover spaces and defend tactically lmao ..
Inter Miami was a trash, until Messi came in action :)
The goalie has been incredible
Take a joyful ride....on the Lionel Train.
I guess south African league is better than mls after seing those goals....anyshot on target is likely a goal
Messi like play with his son.. he not looking serious i think...
The Messi Effect 👍💪
2:44 that save 🫰
What a rigged league lol
Carrer mode: easy
The Philadelphia Union GK is so bad.
Love you Messi
what were those cbs doing😭😭
لاعب مدارس وش ذا لو جاء الهلال افضل
The level in the US is like 3rd tier uk
Philadelphia were great but wasted there chances wide open....😊
Messi and co clearly took advantage over Philadelphia's goal keeper as he was no way near to a proper goalie stance.
The Inter Miami, best team of U.S.A. now.
Goalie was straight Azz 💀
This league is mediocre,  Messi just has to do the bare minimum.
Hasta los hinchas del rival, hinchan por Messi 😂
Messi telah membawa perubahan kepada club inter miami...kepada MLS dan seluruh pecinta sepakbola...unstopable...semoga nnati difinal menang..agar menjadi plot twis n happy ending
That goalkeeper is a joke
GOAT 🐐❤
The Philadelphia keeper sucks. He missed everything that flew in his direction.
at this rate top 10 Saudi teams will beat top 10 mls teams easily wtf is this defending
The defence of MLS teams are horrendous. I hope they will get better over time.
On the 2nd half, messi just stayed midfield, still giving teammates goals. what a chad. goat forever
6:22 player with shirt number 41 scores to make it 4-1
Messi impact alone on MLS is more than all the stars in the Saudi Arabia
That Messi goal from that far out. Insane accuracy.
Their defending is nothing more than a joke.
1:51 dad saying: look son, that's the greatest of all time.
It’s like watching englands 3rd tier, standard is soooooo bad
Wtf Philadelphia has scooter as goal music? 😂 It’s the Gladbach goal music and its one of the best i have ever heard in a stadium
that goalkeeper from Philadelphia just started goalkeeping? thats weird thhe 1st and second goal
GOAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Imagine Callender the goalkeeper now can practice saving shots from Messi, Busquets & Jordi Alba. No wonder his game has since been improved and his confidence boosted.
The standard of defending is so bad in the MLS. That third goal was a joke how easy it was
Messi the goat
5:35 bro thinks they are making a comeback
Rigged tournament
The best thing about this, is the odds I’m still getting on inter Miami to win games!
Shocking goalkeeping from Philly. 💀
I'll go out on a limb and say that the Philli keeper terrible 🙈
The first goal, wtf was that angle from Blake?
Grande Leo 💪 vamos Inter, que arquero Callender un muro💪
For the people saying that the keeper sucks.. don’t only blame him. The whole defense gave away too much which led to the keeper getting into 1v1’s every time.. as a former goalkeeper that’s the most annoying thing that could happen, no matter if I save it or don’t it’s just annoying if the defense sucked like that, that I kept going into 1v1’s
I can fully beat my chest and say, MLS is shitty league 😂😂😂😂. I just watched the HL btw 2 championship teams and my lawd the difference is clear.. championship team oooo wow
MLS 💩
These Barca bois came for a Holiday 🤣🫡
Letting a Goal in on purpose is so pathetic, Stop ruining Football for everyone watching and playing that Game OK?
Miami goalkeeper must be MOM
Pinging that first-time pass at 1:20 was o u t r a g e o u s
Mana orang Indo
They are really playing on Easy Mode
This shows perfectly the level of the MLS😂 It is like 2nd or 3rd leauge in Europe
Fixed matches 👌😌👍😎🙌
Philadelphia GK at fault for first two goals with absolutely awful positioning; no wonder Messi scored from 30 yards!!
Miami bought match obvisialy.
Messi Messi Messi
the level of mls is so low lmaoo no wonder Pepsi is scoring twice each match
The GOAT🐐🐐 doing his usual business, you also can't ignore Callender saves🔥🔥
👑⚽🐐
Commentator on first goal "How do you like that Lionel Messi?' Messi: Challenge Accepted 1:42
messi is happier here than psg
Yes, messi's goal was good but i feel like alba , busquets  and joseph Martinez  aren't getting enough attention  too  also can we just appreciate albas first goal for the club 😊
Look at all those brainwashed, stockholm syndrome, toe suckers in the comments. Yes Pesi will take all your worthless money don't worry! 😂😂😂
Goalkeeper = a plank
Messi after seeing keepers gaming level at first goal, know exacly what to do :)
Inter Miami❎ Barca Miami✅ Haters🤫
Amazing game from the keeper, some stunning saves
Inter miami have changed alot due to messi but they should work more on their defence because calendar would not always save every shot they need a good ariel defender
Union are a terrible team, it’s like watching the women World Cup… no offence ladies
Wow, saya salut kepada goalkeeper nya. Kiper inter Miami luar biasa.
King Messi
All talking about Messi and I understand that guys, but we need to give more credit too the keeper, I mean he made some awesome saves not only this game 💪🏻
This is the most fixed game I’ve ever seen. I wonder how much Philadelphia got paid 😢
That first goal was possible because Messi bought the LB forward creating space at the back for Martinez to receive the pass that Messi pointed his team mate to make. The commentators failed to appreciate Messi’s involvement and said “how do you like that messi” - I had to say something
Месси правильно перешёл в Америку, ему нужно готовиться здесь для следующего мундиаля ))) четыре года поиграет в штатах подготовиться и завоюет чемпионство.
Philly goalkeeper is not on This level
Callender deserves to play elsewhere
Menuda risa lo de esta ligab
the phyladelphia deffence is so bad they dont desserve the cup in this way.
The goalkeeper for Miami's first two goals. LMAO!
Дякуємо за відео! Фантастика. Мессі Термінатор!
At this rate Messi is doing side quests maybe he'll get one from his own half or maybe an Olimpico.
For messi's 30 meter goal it was very lazy from the gk, slowly jogging back as the opposition were rushing forward and flatfooted whilst standing upright
Inter Miami was a bad team, lost 11 matches, and only scored 22 goals in 22 games. When Messi arrived:   - 21 goals and won all 6 games ( Messi scored 9 goals )   - The opportunity to get the first championship   - Boost the confidence of the team   What a miracle, Leo Messi. You're an unbelievable man
The defense are absolutely terrible.
Messi!
that pass though 1:19
I'm a Messi fan but I honestly think Saudi teams are better than these MLS teams that means Saudi league is better than MLS.
Simply goat
I honestly think i could go pro for some of these MLS teams. No pressure, no sense of positioning, awful shots.
Easy breezy ⛵
The Goalkeeper is sooooo bad, omg 😱
Messi is crazy !!! Scoring goals from 30 yards away like nothing 😂
Messi is already tearing it up, the MLS is now finally getting the recognition it deserves
albas goal was so easy. what is the defensive line doing :D
Как приятно наблюдать за игрой Майами. 😊 Не только Месси забивает, но и другие игроки. Это важно.  И вратарь очень хорош! Молодцы все! С Победой!! Продолжайте в том же духе!!
Messi messi messi
Taylor is talented and ubderrated
MLS could never be at the european level 😂😂😂
LM10 💕   LM10 💙    LM10 💛      LM10 💚        LM10 💗 LM10 💓   LM10 💙 LM10 💕   LM10 💙    LM10 💛      LM10 💚        LM10 💗 LM10 💓   LM10 💙
The goat  🐐 effect
Miami in making of 2nd hand Barcelona
Bro what is the gk doing I don't find the quality in spl or mls
Perfect plessing ball of leo messi🐐👍👏👏👏
Messi League Soccer is good league
No no no, this League is Scandal. Everyone want Leo scoring a goal. Not Except his enemy
As an European watching MLS always kept me wondering why all goalies in the US seem to struggle in certain situations. Like there is a big difference between goalkeeper in Europe compared to the US. Congrats to Messi and his fellow Barca friends. They bring new ways and styles to the mls. Great to watch and see Messi happy as he was as an 18 years old!
Messi is The Greatest Of All Time 🙌🙌🙌
Wow the positional play by the goalie from Philly on the first 2 goals is dogshit...
Messi meta carte 😂😂😂 for me it is better than cr7 🐐🐐 that end career is more honorable 🤜🏽🤛🏽
NON CI CREDO! In America gli highlights durano più di 3 minuti!
Are those professional players?
Captain Argentina is back in the United States  Good luck in the Final, Captain
MLS is fun to watch, as you see many individual skills and actions. But most of the teams have a lack of structure, defensive awareness, tactical understanding. Philadelphias defense was ridiculous.
Ronaldoooooooo😏😏
Kryvtsov assist 1-st goal! Glory to Ukraine!
Bu nasıl bi lig lan fifa gibi aq 😂😂😂
MLS looks soft tbh...
Mehn the union defense was weak and too open. They did their best tho, best of luck next time guys. Messi as always a driving force of excitement in Europe and the U.S.
9 goals in 6 games for messi because the league is bad, worst defenders ever :D
Great to see MArtinez score from the run of play. He was CRACK for ATL UTD in their earliest days. Now he is regaining his form...
Commentator: Union are the most consistent team of the decade, conceding the least number of goals.  Josef Martinez: Hold my beer🍺😂😂😂 Miami 1-0 Union
Ever since Messi got that number 10 back he's on fire.
Enjoy watching the real 🐐🔥🔥
americans are so funny xD
This Callender guy is something else
😊
Last season Erling Haaland scored 52 (36 in the Premier League)  goals for ManCity, and they got orgasm over some guy who scored 77 goals in 3 years 😅😅😅
A goalkeeper's feet tell you a lot about what they think is about to happen. Look at Blake's legs when Messi was about to strike the ball—dude is SHOOK. He has no idea where the ball is about to go. And how could he, really? Messi can put the ball past someone so many different ways.
Look at that 3rd goal..Sunday league
SETTINGAN.
im sorry but the Philadelphia goalie needs to be investigated
this is the most weird shittty game I watched ever, what a weak league , a street league
Wagner. putting some great flankers in there for Philly.
Meeeeesi meeeeesi😊
That Goal even got Jordis attention
Meeeeesìiiiii❤
Callender is a really good gk
You'd think these center backs would at some point start adapting when in every game there's multiply guys just running past them with a through pass 😅
Miami's goal were beautiful but how the f*ck did PHI miss those 2 chances. Like seriously what the hell was that 🤷
Man How Messi is bullying MLS teams is crazy 🔥
The level of this league is embarrassing 😂
Blake is the best goalkeeper in major league soccer.
Goalkeepers positioning is horrendous 😂😂
Philly got dismantled unbelievable.
messi scores more in mls than me in sundays league
Makes a vertical run???🧐
Poor Kipper
Miami gole keeper is pro 😮
Where was the goalkeeper?
Good to see Messi look like he is enjoying football again
Philadelphia defense doesnt exist bruh☠️
MLS Better than Saudi Pro League...........
Messi League soccer
Philadelphia goalkeeper 😂😂😂🤦🏻
Amateurs level defences, amateur level goalkeepers, MLS teams will probably be relegated in each one of the top10 Europeans leagues
I know these are only highlights, but it looks like Philadelphia had the chances to score a few more.  Great highlights.
You know that the MLS is crap, when even Messi scores his longest yard goal of his CAREER😂😂😂
I love callender especially how he's saving goals I wish next season he will come to Barca
Nah MLS the real farmers league.
MLS >>>> Camel League  Messi >>>>>>>> Ronaldo
To play without goalkeeper isn’t very good idea…
1:47 that goalkeeper belike😂: is that even a person?! :D
Sergey Kryvtsov assist 💪
messi goal is good.. credit him for taking that shot.. if you don't shoot, you don't score. I'm not taking anything from him, but has to say the goalkeeper is very poor. it's not like a thunderbolt shot into the top corner. His positioning prior to messi's shot is not good.
Messi literally changed Inter Miami. -Philly Fan
Không có gì sướng bằng một buổi chiều chill với anh tôi ghi bàn :)))))
Wow
Was ein schwaches Stellungsspiel von Blake bei den ersten beiden Toren oh je 😂😂😂
Messi is the G.O.A.T
For Lionel, training at Barca was tougher than MLS games.  Very, very poor level of soccer in USA.Huge gaps between defenders, you can go with the ball  and nobody challenges you. Just like in Saudi Arabia: you can buy big names with tons of money, but you can't buy tradition in football, that is native
farmer's league
It hurts to see how bad MLS is comparing to other bad leagues like Saudi Arabia... i thought Saudi was bad, but MLS is in a different level of badness.
Messi shouldn’t be here… he’s bullying the entire US “soccer” league
Comm..ry lit🔥 It's a Miami Dream - It's a Philadelphia Nightmare
The game Futbol with the Commentary of WWE
Messi📌💥💥💥
Boy that goalkeeper sucks
How is Callendar so good and the other keeper so bad?
Messi has had an impact on the whole league not just MLS
Messi arrived Martinez skillz unlocked Taylor skillz unlocked Busquets and Alba, not you guys, your a legend already.
If a ball bounces twice it should have been saved smh
Ngl messi is good but i think they laid every team to lose cause this is to EZ wtf
I’m just lost for words at this point. Messi League Soccer.
Messii❤❤❤❤❤
Philadelphia goalkeeper's positioning was abysmal on the first 2 goals
Commentary jinx Philadelphia on the first goal
How i wish, Miami would get Puig
the keeper some times makes incredible saves but sometimes eat stupid goals like the 1 - 3 where the ball came near his face
4:09 and they say mls is better than saudi 🤣🤣
Messi is the only one who left Europe we can’t complain about
Keeper man🤦🏽‍♂️
Are teams told not to defend against Miami !
Watching these defenses make my eyes bleed, atrocious football
Pie face is a better keeper than that donny
“Somebody needs to stop Messi from 30 yards out, the only thing he needs is a gap, half a yard, and you’ll be picking up the ball from the net” Wow. American commentators are underrated
MLS goalkeeper's quality is very very low
Amazing saves from Calender, and amazing goal from GOAT.
Inter Miami were always in the bottom of table points but suddenly they are in the final of league !! Martinez and messi impacts !!
He hits the corners EVERY SINGLE TIME. And his passing is unreal when they double team him. He makes it look so easy..ITS NOT! I feel privileged to watch the GOAT before he hangs it up. I have a friend who plays professional soccer. He told me Messi was going to destroy defenses. He was so right.
philly keepers not up to standard
You can't name another team in the world that's in last place in league and on the verge of winning a trophy. The fact that this is happening and no one is calling it out as strange is just...well...strange. Well done, MLS?
I really enjoy watiching those mls highlights but I can’t help but think that it’s a shame Messi didn’t stay in Europe a few more years. It just looks way too easy for him. Side note: American football commentators are funny but make me cringe a lot.
Messi literally changed difficulty from world class to semi pro on the plane to Miami
Amateur league .
wtf im just watching
WoW… Philadelphia goalkeeper are bad on the first and second goals
Miami just pulled their foreskins and put them in front of Philadelphia’s mouths
i actually support Miami and now MESSI AND SERGIO BUSQUETS
애미 우승각
The Philadenphia team is a joke. Bad midfileder, bad defender, bad keeper.
The Philly goalkeeper is shocking
How bad is Philadelphia’s Goalkeeper
Barca cabang usa
i'm scary by the lvl in this league OMG to easy
У филадельфии до 73ей минуты была установка лупить выше ворот)))
Barca players have got a perfect retirement home😊
The MLS must incorporate relegation into their league if they want teams to consider defending and goalkeeping seriously. Football isnt all about attacking
When 5 years experienced pubgm player played with a new account and matching a bot lobby he scored like that .. xD 😀
That Philli GK Fifa card should defo be rated 52
Como se lo pasa Leo jugando al fútbol en la MLS. Está más feliz acá que en sus dos años en el PSG
С Месси, команда хочет сама играть. Красавцы!
ffs was this a semi final or just a friendly game? Philadelphia's defence was shambolic, their keeper was a##🤔
That Philadelphia keeper is starstruck abd committing blunders upon blunders
❤
The goat 🐐🐐🐐🐐 always keep football alive✌️✌️
Why would the backside defender track the overlapping run on the opposite side of the field? It makes no sense, unless you are trying to let the other team score. It's just odd at this level to see soccer IQs that low. Looks staged.
That Philli goalkeeper is suspect
Blake, who on his day is one of the best goalkeepers in the MLS, had a stinker, he was at fault for goals 1,2 and 4 IMO. His body positioning for the first 2 goals could have been better, the 4th goal was a misjudgment coming off his line so quickly.
messi it is better to leave the league is not at  your level
What a farmers league..
Poor goalkeeping 😢😢
Put a keeper in that goal...
Let's just congratulate Miami on winning the League Cup final ❤
the only reason I watch this Pommes League Match is Messi, so you all know.
Nobody talks about Kai Wagners pass in the 8th minute. That was class
Poor Andre Blake...he had the worst game of his career.
Miami right now reminds me of season 3 of Ted lasso 😂
Holy, this is worse than women's football, wtf did I just watch?
This goalkeeper man!!! Seriously
MESSI IS A PHENOMENON, REALLY THE BEST!   WHAT GOAL, OMG!!  AND ALBA GOAL!   INTER MIAMI IS A STRONG TEAM!!
Mls what a joke
Messi is playing against fifa npc players
Perdieron mis víboras 🐍🐍😭😭😭
Who is that guy with number 17 on phili?. He does everything wrong, he played so bad. 😂
MLS defense and attack is such a blast to watch, its the best comedy show lol, one side is dominationg, and the other ones have no clue what to do
OMG, MLS has bad defense.....
Imagine Philadelphia playing in Germany while their shirt says bimbo 🫠
Messi with old vibes 😱😱🥶🥶
this league has by far the worst goalkeepers hahaha
Messi is goat 🐐🎉
Callender 👍
No defence in MLS
USA learning soccer from other countries while other’s countries learning basketball from USA(NBA).. Europe countries r climbing up too.. c how no.1 draft & any drafts r from  Europe recently years..
what is kids football? MLS is absolutely football where there is no fight at all... dear amrican people, this is not a real football!
How bad is the positioning of the goali from Phili😂😂😂
🐐🐐🐐🐐
Drake Callender!!!!
This league is literally a joke
G. O. A. T.
Philly playing the wrong type of football
I'm Ukrainian. When Messi moved to this club, I became curious about Kryvtsov. Holds the level or not, because he was never a top back. And after looking at several highlights, I realized that everything is ok. No, he does not play brilliantly. But I saw how other backs play in MLS :'D
This league is so bad at defending
It’s Messiiii
Messi
Messi goat❤
🐐
Messi has no right to score from that distance. Insane precision and pace from that distance 🔥
the caster curse is crazy
Vamooooos Inter 🩷
Come on Andre Blake. Arguably the best keeper in the league looking brutal on those first two goals.
Keepernya baru belajar wkwkwkw
As much as people credit Messi for helping to inspire this team to perform well (which is well deserved), one should not forget not only the contributions his veteran Barça teammates Busquets and J. Alba make, but also how Deandre Yedlin, who is a US Men's national team veteran who played in both 2014 and 2022 World Cups helps Alba in defending the back row
какой низкий уровень у команд) даже в англ чемпиошипе американским командам было бы тяжело
Damn, Philadelphia only has a 4th division keeper and defence LMAO
King🇦🇷🐐
That keeper is a joke,how do you concede and still laugh
still goat🎉
Damn the MLS is so bad 😢
Messi Messi Messi
The MESSI league soccer
The keeper is loosing the net all the time...
I am glad for Messi, but those MSL teams are too weak and do not know how to make defence!
Ngeri
Amk was hat Philadelphia die Gladbach torhymne
Great Game from callender, insane saves
Btw this format of not saying the score in the title or thumbnail is much better imo.
We understand that the only thing you can watch in MLS is Messi. How do you get a low goal from that distance?
What a easy league 😂
Drake not getting enough credit
Inter Miami might currently be the most thrilling to watch football team!
the standard of football out there is purely laughable, my local sunday league side would compete in that league, jesus christ
PU looks like a garbage team!
The whole team has a global fame , thanks to greatness of the great messi....
How much did they pay the goalie 😂 😂😂😂😂😂 ffs that's an easy save
03:40 Philadelphia no. 5 WTF. He made no attempt to stop the ball. MATCH FIXING???
Mls league is the worat in the world, even china's league is better, dis u aee the goalkeeper haha a joke
Messi showed how low the level of play in mls
Nashville has much better defense, better goalkeeper, more organize and better attack. Game will be in Nashville home, so final will be different for Miami. Nashville 2 - 1 Miami
💪 powerful person make team powerful Messi King Namsate 🙏
Ofcourse, the saves of Callender were on point! But is nobody gonna talk about how bad the goalkeeper of Philadelphia Union is?😅
The level is very very low. Players basically standing just after kick off.  Like under 12. It really is a retirement league
mls is so bad lol
I cant help my self, but goalkeepers in MLS are terrible
Inter Miami are now a different team, thanks to Messi!
How do you like that Lionel Messi??? Aren't they on the same team??
messi changing miami's career
americans dont realize that for messi this is just a high school  level game , he is casually  playing and assists others in making a goal
Τhey are doing everything in the fkin MLS federation they do everything for fucking Inter Miami to win basically for fkin Messi to win. Man by far MLS is the most corrupted football "league" in the world. I didn't see anything like this before.
the script writers did a good job
bouquets goat  stupid 😂😂😂😂😂
2:56 - Commentators didn't say a single word about #17 there on the right, at least 5 yards behind the nearest defender, negating any possibility of offside and basically inviting Miami to score? Are they new to this game or something?
Love to watch Messi ruling MLS
match fixing at its finest
I feel like if you switch the goalkeepers, Philly win this one.
I'm watching MLS for the first time, it feels like I'm watching UFC
you know this is an Amateur league when number 17 be   not playing the offside and staying behing when all his teammates are pressing more forward lmao like at least stay in line with your other CB
Penaldo fans crying

"They want wagner to have an impact" they already do but now they need to have a impact in football? 🤣🤣
Messi is good but MLS is so far below his level... He is never covered, goalkeeper is on is heels with Messi on the ball with space... Terrible
inter need to reinforce that leaky defense
MLS ... like "Kreisklasse" in Germany 😅
That save from Callender 🔥
ผลกระทบที่เมสซี่มีต่อทีมอินเตอร์ไมอามี่มันบ้าไปแล้ว🐐 วันอาทิตย์นี้ต้องได้แชมป์🏆
Callender is very underrated he is a class keeper
The Goalkeeper from Inter Miami Just pure 🔥🔥
Philadephia's keeper made all the wrong moves tonight lol

This game looked rigged.  Philly defense and GK didn't even try to prevent any of those goals.
Why philadelphia team very weak!!! And some players missed big chances strangely🤨
Кривцов тащит. Ну и Месси тож норм.
Burger league even saudi league is better 😂😂😂
Messi aint in his right mind.  No player besides messi looks at the goal from 33 yards with 3 players on him and says hmmmm its think its a good idea to shoot from 33 yards
what a goal from messi
Was messi's shot that good or is the keeper poor?
American commentators are funny😂😂😂😂
The commentary is like WWE 😂
Penaldo fans: Messi can’t score like Ronaldo from 30 yards 😂
Messi 👑👑👑👑
Did PHI play with their janitor in the goal? 😂 What's that lad doing? XD
Amazing spectacle 😍😍😍
lawak anjir liat kiper philadepia . kebobolan malah nyengir😆
FIFA in beginners mode🤣🤣.
The defending is so poor from both teams
Mmmeeesssiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
The goalie could have saved that, but, props to Messi for trying, he saw that the goalie was in a bad position, running backwards, and that shot placement was precise! Instant impact on the team, the morale must be pretty high right now. And also props to Drake Callender for keeping them in the lead, some of those saves were amazing.
Messi will completely change MLS  Ronaldo changing Saudi pro league 😍
The atmosphere of the team looks great, as if they truly enjoy football
Are we gonna act like that Messi goal was a gift by the Keeper.?
Messi goood good n good cr7 ambisius.
Sad to see the goat belittling himself to play in this trash retirement home league!
philadelphia copied french kits so they deserved to lose.
atrocious keeping
Wtf MLS teams are so good in soccer 😅
Fixed goal for Messi 😑
Philly is not even League Two level… afwul defending and goalkeeper
Messi is the best....magical goal...
I love watching leo play but as always the enemies defend like they ve just startet playing football couple of weeks ago 😂 it’s insane
"Messi might be on the ball, but he is always watching you" -  Atletico Goal keeper Jan Oblack
A Ferrari against Lada's. Messi vs players (Lada's). 90% of players in MLS won't play in Europe cause of lack of skills and experience end of the story. Messi was and he is the GOAT (the Ferrari)
Were the Philadelphia team deliberately missing? And their defenders deliberately leaving the defense? Cus this is ridiculous. The pass to Jordi Alba, the defender literally dodged that pass or what 😂😂😂😂
Glad Messi didn‘t go to Saudi Arabia to play in the desert…honest people can‘t be bought.
Messuuuuuuu
How do you like that Lionel Messi!  Messi shuts him up....what a jack @ss of a commentator
Articial field? cmone guys this is joke !
The ticket price was insane I'd say.
It's almost as if Messi is playing with sliders on ☠️
Burger league magic
I love Messi but Philadelphia is horrible
This keeper
This is so funny, even Messi feels like he cheating this is like playing fifa on beginner. That’s not happening in top leagues 😂😂
Das ist doch kein Fußball…die stehen gefühlt nur rum und kicken den Ball bisschen hin und her. Erinnert mich stark an Altherren Fußball was die da betreiben
Messiiiii
Молодець Кривцов, чудова гра!!!
How do you stop him
What a good goalkeeper Inter Miami has
Leo❤🎉
Intermiami pembunuh raksasa
Defending in MLS is non existent
Everyone is talking about messi, but no one noticed the work of the coach Tata Martino. Imagine how impactful he is as well!  Its not only about messi! :)
❤️
"the worst team in the league" 🤣 the headlines not even 2 months ago. Miami's front 3 is DEADLY! & with the support of Alba, Busquets & Yedlin... this team is insane man.
Messi gets most of the credit, but u gotta give man of the match to Inter Miami's Goalkeepr
It’s rigged over all cmon now , let’s be honest
What a route.
greatest of all time carry his team to final
Messi on the team has brought out the best from the WHOLE team! these men combined are playing like a Champions League team!! you love to see it.
When Messi is in town 👏👏👏👏👏 weldone Miami. Now there is team spirit and confidence 🤞
Eterno Lionel 🔥❤🇦🇷 the G.O.A.T BY MILES
Mls low level
Siuuuuuuuu
Dios te proteja Messi
Messi and Miami is now the most interesting team in the world.
That goal that made the score 1 - 3, was literally "L2 + O" on Fifa 23 🤣
God protect you Messi
HO. LEE. FUQ. You just cannot be this good. Every play was perfect, including every save from Callender. I literally only saw one mistake in 94 minutes. If Busquets had cleared that ball instead of letting it bounce off him and Union score, this would have been the perfect game from Inter Miami. The most clinical teams in the world don't play this well. I cannot believe what I've just seen.
Blake had a shocker
That Phili keeper’s reaction speed is appalling
The GOAT drives the inter miami into the Finale.
Look at them fans celebrating that 1-3 like an equalizer lmao, bros really thought they could come back. 😭
This keeper is so crazy
that pass :D
Kids vs professional football player  Philly vs Miami
Oh Leo how I miss watching you in my beloved Barça. Glad you are having fun there ❤️🐐
Did Victoria select the colours for Inter Miami team?
inter miami like
Messi is him
goalie's clearly at fault for goals 1 and 2, could've done better with number 4
Ridicolous the Philly Goalkeeper
Callender! Doing amazing saves JESUS
Rigged
Its like they are playing with kids😂😂
This is crazy, but great for the league! Messi doesn't just uplift Miami, he uplifts the whole league. Don't forget that these guys aren't just playing with the greatest player in the world, they're also playing AGAINST him. This is a tremendous opportunity for young players on all sides to get a taste of continental football. This is great for everyone involved.
First goal from Martinez the defender was just watching. Sergio Ramos would definitely kick the ball out together with striker's legs))
Never used to watch MLS highlights. Now it’s all I can watch. Messi magic
No way bro really said soccer
Nise game . Inter miami 🐐. Messi is goat 🐐
Messi's influence is unreal🐐🐐
Unstoppable Messi👽👽👽❣️
What a Match 😊❤❤ Messi in another final 😅😂❤❤❤
This league is a joke
Messi impact is no joke
I am so happy for this team.
Awful goalkeeper for messi goal
LM10 >MLS
Messi rules
Liga lawak
Blake positioning was a disgrace in all goals conceded
NGL would appreciate a better thumbnail from MLS Media, but if your going for something authentic I think this is fine.
MESSI EFFECT Even a lower ranked team reached the Final 😍😍
Good luck for final goat❤️❤️
Why every match in MLS isnt that competitive ? I admired LM10 and CR7 both of them. And i follow every match that they play . But TBH, right now imo .. saudi league is more competitive. Every match, the defense , the strike , the goalkeeper.
Leo Messi 💕💕
You can just see the Messi effect cus Robert Taylor and drake calendar are now just outstanding
Second goal should have been saved from that distance, third goal a real blunder by that defender playing Alba onside
This goalkeeper is a joker
😂😂 Hai Hai lool noo msl
That GK of Philly is horrendous lol
Bro that Miami goalkeeper is really good
Philadelphia keeper 😂
Philadelphia kiper ia the big jokes
Kak keeper
It’s easy to score against Burger King employee. Embarrassing league.
Messi’a playing at MLS like it’s on easy difficulty on fifa 😂😂
Keeper was shocking for those first two goals his positioning is Sunday league-esque
goal keeping was very poor
I could’ve stopped messi’s goal even if i didn’t have legs
Leo is 25 yo again 😊...
My 10 years brother is better than Philadelphia's keeper 😂
Just give the league cup and the MLS to Messi
Bro Miami won  nearly Nothing before messi and now they are Champions contender😂
Jordi Alba+Busquets+Messi=🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
What 😦 Is messsi Doing Brooo Love from Bangladesh 💙🤍💙
Messi's goal was just superb but  Philadelphia's attack should be detained in jail. Like who tf misses 4 open goals if I am not wrong !!!
That's why he is in major league soccer ... guys  remind the 2026 wc
Its amazing how a commentator can ignore amateurish mistakes on the part of one team to make another team seem like a bunch of superstars.
Inter Miami Vice  A story about a former Real Madrid player (an English man) recruiting his sworn enemies from Barcelona (mainly an Argentine) from Spain to come and disrupt (inspire) an under dog MLS team in America. The plot thickens.
Goat... Leo leo leo leo leo leo leo leo leo mes siiiiiiiii..
Is there anyone to blame to Philadelphia's goalkeeper and also to appreciate Inter Miami? For me, Messi and Inter Miami is 100% good and Philadelphia's goalkeeper is 100% bad.. After all, just lover Inter Miami❤❤❤❤❤
Well i must say the saves are incredible
Philly playing basketball out there with all the high balls
The joy I feel from watching Messi here is similar to what I felt at the World Cup. At first I didn’t know how well Inter Miami would do with Messi after their winless streak but this is much more than I would have ever expected. Love you messi
Messi
goal reminded me of Messi vs Mexico
On that first goal Messi signaled Krytsov to make that pass to Martinez. Messi was definitely coaching in that situation.
Inter miami signs some cheatcode. From worst to best  team.
PHILADELPHIA DEFENDER & GOALKEEPER IS SLEEPY 😂😂
Great game, question to the experts how many games do they need to win to qualify for playoff??
PHILADELPHIA DEFENDER & GOALKEEPER IS SLEEPY 😂😂
MLS defending is atrocious
barca is probably already regretting that busquets is not with them. Really different player
Why no hibrid pitch in major leage stdiums
Why is PHI keeper so terrible?
PHILADELPHIA GOALKEEPER 's SLEEPY 😂😂
Lionel messi is absolutely genius 👏 🙌🏻
Major Leauge Football man
philly guys need much more training on their shooting accuracy💀
That keeper is insane 🎉
PHILADELPHIA GOALKEEPER 's SLEEPY 😂😂
Inter Miami 👍
The real Messi is number 10
Imagine playing 5 defend player and still can't stop this beast 🔥🔥
PHILADELPHIA GOALKEEPER 's SLEEPY 😂😂PHILADELPHIA GOALKEEPER 's SLEEPY 😂😂
is ut only me or when robert tailor when doing that spin turn to pass, his movements looked like hoe Messi moves?
Messi will force Americans to fall in love with the beautiful game. He's already done more for football in America than any other player in history.
What kind of a goal keeper is that!?
I never saw a football match more scripted than this. American football is absolutely third class.
RONALDO miles better than this minnow basher dwarf
A long range shot by Messi on the ground. Hmmm, now that's something new.
Inter Messi F.C.
Messi, Busquets, Alba changed the whole team chemistry. Love seeing this.
🐐
Funny,it took a dude from Miami to score against Inter Miami,dammit Philadelphia had their chances,wasted chances!
Teacher: Can anyone show us how to miss chances by the bucket load? Philadephia Union: ✋
They have three Ferrari in the team against eleven Fiat. 😆
Miami start to believe unbeatable after 4-3
15 year olds in the uk defend better than that first goal lol
Messi has turned Inter Miami to a prime Barcelona...
❤🎉
Mesi is all rounder..In almost half game he is played as Defender
Callender did his thing mannn hats off
The GOATkeeper
Goat just doing side missions.
GK had a storming game!!!
Messi's effect is just amazing, team that was losing everything now wins every game
Callender is player of the match
i do not think it is fair for this inter miami team to keep playing in MLS.😭😭😭😭😭 this is just bullying at this point. they should play some europe teams that would be interesting to see
GOAT MESSI EFFECT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
@mls now that you are attracting many EPL, UEFA , and worldwide fans, maybe its time to call yourself @MLF. AFterall, the game is called football by the rest of us.
The defense is improving and massive shout-outs to Callender🎉 Taylor🎉and messi🎉
When will Messi lose
Truly the greatest of all time… it’s baby work for him.   Edited : Btw, Alba scoring his goal gave me a lot of flashbacks… imo he’s the same if not slightly better than balde… Messi x Alba was as good as Messi x Dani in their own categories
Robert Taylor will be in Europe soon.  What a talent.
The goalie was shocking... totally at fault for the first two
this league is not at all worth watching
Mls deffender🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
The frightening thing is Miami only going to get better and better as time goes on the more they play together ... plus messi just can stop scoring 🐐
Messi League Soccer 😂😂 MLS, i can see only soccer, no football is being played there 😂😂
Haha that guy on the Messi guy rolling around is hilarious
❤😂EVERY BODY JUST CONTINUES TO" DOUBT" THIS GENUIS🎉🎉😂😂😮😮❤❤❤
As a European watching this reminds me of the season 2010/11 at barça. They just won everything. The Messi effect not only made inter Miami better but will also force the other MLS teams to perform better.
As a European watching Messi and Miami Fc i am interested more in MLS now!
this is so neautiful i am enjoying every moment of thiss
🐐
Honestly this is a cheap league for an african third division player  if i had  the chance I would play and progress in this league.
He could never ground the ball from that far out in Europe. Defense over there is tighter. Messi coming to the US will force the MLS to adjust their play and bring it to a higher level.
Its sad how scripted this league is😂😂
The goalie almost celebrated that goal
Damn Messi really is insane
Philadelphia Union look awful
One has to wonder about that Philly 'keeper...
Wow that Union GK has awful positioning
Leo Messi always king of football Hestroy love you boss ❤️❤️❤️
..truth be told ..this commentator is another gem..😁😇
King 👑
Callender deserves massive thumbs up...
MLS disetting untuk Tesi biar Jadi promo PILDUN Mamarika 2026  MLS (Mesi Lig Soker)
The keeper could have done better.
The gk was a Messi fan 😮‍💨
Messi is a true leader
Miami has to improve on their defence... They were able to breathe easy thanks to abysmal finishing from Philadelphia
🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
*Just change it to MLF!*
il calcio maschile statunitense è infimo livello, penso che anche i giovani delle primavere della nostra serie A  potrebbero competere o anche vincere nella loro lega; e se fosse possibile farlo poi dovremmo dire le stesse cose che vengono delle sul calcio femminile, cioè : dato che non battono neanche dei calciatori maschi quindicenni , non " meritano " il diritto di giocare a calcio, e dovrebbero andare a cucinare o a lavorare . ripeto, se dovessimo usare  lo stesso metro di giudizio
Messi is an alien with an alien impact on his teammates.
“The most important match in Miami’s history” haha ffs they’re history only spans 5 years. This commentator loves hyperbole 😅
Visca Barca! ❤💙
Let’s take a moment to appreciate Callender’s save 😮🙌🏽
only American commentator would say something like "How do you like that Messi" after Messi's teammate scored
A vertical run?! I’d like to see that very much.
That goalie from philly😂
Despite all the star players the league has, I dont care one bit about the Saudi Pro League. But as a European I do care about the MLS this season, and its all because of the GOAT.
Sorry to say but not anyone on here saying the keeper should of saved that poor keeping mls is a very average league
Terrible goalkeeper from PU side
Inter Miami just proved they are one hell of a defense to beat. Until first 60-70 min they were really good (Miami had to endure around 15 fouls as well). That Union goal was out of bad luck. Mark my words, Miami is winning it all in the Final as well. 🤩😍
Very very poor marking and goalkeeper
Isn't it illegal to score from that far out?
I will testify it to my grandchildren
Ambatakam
Mls Defenders are joke
What are these goalkeepers how are Messifans blaming Saudi League, this is even worse lol
MLS defenders are no joke
1:33 Messi Goal
Semi Finals we watched in 2022: Man City vs Real Madrid 4-0 Semi Finals we watch now: Inter Miami vs Philadelphia Union 4-1
They prepared for Busquets, Kryvtsov came out of syllabus. 😂😂
messi show His Magic 🔥🔥🔥🔥
messi smurfing in the mls
Aku cuman liat goal messi aja😅
Who knows that Messi is the 👑🐐🐐     👇
Did Philly get paid to lose this game. Such easy goals (but quality) from IM ⚽️
This is McDonalds league 😂
Superman Messi
This league ist actually such a joke. Philadelphia defenders are just a bunch of NPCs. They have no sense for pressing or defending a space. If they arnt hugging the next best player they just stand in the middle of nowhere. I mean seriously. There are senior teams of people over 40 playing better than this. No wonder a team with some decent players and someone like Messi can do what they do. Its like playing on easy mode
Goat ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I am very happy that Messi got rid of the fascist PSG fans 🙂🙏
We need more haters and still this man wouldn't stop showing the best skills of football and team spirit.....I believe He was born different only for mesmerizing the eyes of those watching football games all the time....We are Lucky to watch him playing ❤ Respect Messi❤
messi🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Inter Miami before Messi : mediocre Inter Miami after Messi : peak Barcelona FC
God I’ve been a Miami supporter since before they ever played a single minute, this run feels like a dream
That #10 has a bright future
That goalie could have done better for every goal. Especially the first. His positioning was very off
They really need to improve defense in this league
What a goal by the GOAT 🔥 Happy to see Alba scoring his first for miami. Hope busquets gets his one soon too
What a goal!!
Goat 🐐 affect
Messi card is broken in MLS
Twellman is annoying.
MLS best league in the world
People keep saying Messi changed the team, forgetting that also Tata is a new coach and wherever he changes everything
Impossible is nothing ❤❤❤
В таком слабом чемпионате даже Кокорин бы забивал походу.
Talk about improvement, i dont think Inter Miami could have made much better trades.
Messi cooked them all
I still don’t understand (from the first game) why no one pressures Sergio when he has the ball…   Philly’s defence and number of missed chances ☠️
Messi Goat 🐐
вратарь очень слабый, позицию выбирать не умеет, к ударам не готов, уровень любой двор стран снг
Massi magic❤
Never watched US football Since Messi watched all match highlights of Miami Messi is on fire
Our idol keeps rioting in retirement league.
MLS : messi league soccer😂
Miami spent $50-$60million on just messi for this season. Union spent $10million for the WHOLE TEAM last season.
Tendangan messi macam rudal wow wow
That Robert Taylor assist for Jordi Alba's goal is so underrated. He literally held the ball through Philly players and laid a perfect ball. What a tournament he's having!
Props to the goalkeeper. Played really well too
wtf this league ?
This league is joke
322
🐐
Ever since messi came to inter miami the whole team got a upgrade and now everyone is playing very well
Defence is banned in America.
Every team will have to increase their quality and standards of play in order to not get massacred by Miami again in the future.  This is a wake up call for the MLS.  One man alone has really shown how lacking MLS is in terms of playing the game overall given its a professional stage.
This Callender guy is pretty good. MLS defending is still terrible, Messi is still the GOAT
Goalkeeper on fire!!!!
Messi plot armour continues
Messi was the one piece missing in the MLS - he is Joyboy!!!
The way the media were bigging up Union like they were the 2nd coming of Barcelona 😂
Pessi is farming whit unkonw club 😂🤡🤡
MLS > EPL
think the game scripted for Messi getting a trophy
Messi goal maybe can get puskas
mls 😇🥰😍💯💥saudi league🤬🤮🤢🤕🤒😷🥴
Messi is to MLS to what Michael Jorden was to the NBA.  It shows us what greatness is capable of accomplishing !  This will elevate the the entire league.
Прицел игроков Филадельфия Юнион просто имба.
This is playing fifa at Amateur level!!!
Looks like the union GK is not interested to save or is the MLS goalkeeper standards this bad.  2 easy saves converted to goal.
thatS we call rocket in football! Oh MESSI oh MESSI
The best team in MLS.....inter Miami CF. Congratulations to Miami CF.
Bro that miami goal keeper turned into prime Neuer in this match.
Inter Miami's goal keeper did really well today. He is the man of the match for me.
Thank you MLS Youtube handlers for not spoiling the score in the title! :)
It's the most easy league , damn 😅
Callender has been insane
Bro gonna score every match
This time I like to say that the goalkeeper is fantastic, he saved so many ball which would have been goals. Hands up for him. 😊
❤❤❤❤always love to see our goat magic and his new capacity.... waoh awesome
Everyone appreciating messi only but  Gk callender is also the beast 🔥🔥
Looks like Miami have got a top class keeper.
The Barcelona boys are doing wonders for this club. Messi’s leadership with Busquets and Alba. Just beautiful football to watch
Philadelphia goalie is very bad lol
I was really nervous about this match because Philadelphia was a hard rival… but honestly, from all the teams, this was the most easy to fight, even Charlotte (4-0) gave a better fight…
waching messi from brasil
Philly has a horrible defense none of them tried
GK of PHI was a horrible nightmare for a fans
Ffs messi doesn’t deserve to play in this league
Inter miami doesn't have  goal keeper ❌❌ They have goat keeper ✅✅
Messiiii Messiiiiii Messiiiiiiii ❤
King is always king wherever he goes,Goat Messi
Since messi they are all playing top tier level  Brave and perfect team at the moment
🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷 LOVE U MESSI  LOVE U INTER MIAMI
Philadelphia was trying so hard not to score
Mls commentary...lol😂
Taylor Is a major league problem
jeez wtf keeper
Messi is just enjoying his time at inter Miami. The 🐐
I could confirm Messi is playing career mode 😂
What were those defenders doing for Messi's goal? they just let people turn and run? unreal.
0:32 : Messi signal on Martinez's goal 👀
1:19 that pass was clean
1:18 that pass 🔥
Кривцов машина)
Messis shot wasnt that great. The goalies are just on different levels.
Messi is playing football. The rest plays soccer. Big difference.
It is just too easy
Messi the GOAT!!!!  🇦🇷🇮🇹
Amazing
Golazooooo Messii🎉🎉🎉🎉
I still believe if psg would have played like inter Miami is playing they could have done something in champions. He’s enjoying the game playing with no stress. 🐐
👍👍👍👍👍
🩷🐐Messi🤜🤛 Martinez🩷
Look the Messi goal was a huge Union mistake but the Jordi Alba goal was pure Union mistake because he is a full left back but he went ahead of Messi like a faulse 9/10 at the same time, pure Barcelona!!!
*MLS is a baby league, when u can do 40 meter simple shot and score. And all defenders don't know how to play. 👍 It's not a real football, its exactly soccer*
This fucking man should never have left Europe. Oh God, plz bring him back to Europe😩😩
Callender  >>>> Donnarumma
MTM on fire✌💓
not only hes contributing to goals of each matches, but also his presence is enough to boost the spirit and morality of everyone in inter miami, truly a 🐐
The team names are so funny man :D
Inter's attack is brutal, of course, the best player is there. Now they need at least 2 good defenders, because the keeper can't save them every time. This game could've been 4-3 easily.
the goalie was so far over for that first goal
Callender really doing some insane saves
Y toda la Florida está feliz, menos Orlando
การมาของเมสซี่ ได้ทำให้พัฒนาการของทีมนั้นก้าวหน้าไวมากๆ ไหนจะเซอร์กี้และอัลบา ต่างแบ่งปันประสบการณ์ในยุโรปใน MLS ทุกสายตาจับจ้องแล้ว เมสซี่ยังคงเป็นเมสซี่
wow
I love Messi but this league is sh*t man 😅😅
No other star that came to MLS ever had this kind of impact
Miami is just incredible. Messi still GOATing.
Messi has been a beast after coming to inter Miami and they have become unstoppable.
callender look a like prime casillas dawg
Messi is on career mode
That Philadelphia defence is shocking... So many gaps to run into
everything is already set for messi
Inter Miami created a new monster. Robert Taylor
The impact that Messi, Alba and Busquets have had on this team is ridiculous
MLS : Messi Like Scoring 😅
It should be like this not always dependent on messi 👌
Tunisian championnat 19aout
That is absolutely garbage goal keeping. Not even an obstruction blocking the keepers view and it still went in??
Changing the face of American football. Messi the 🐐🐐🐐🐐
Miami messiye nannayi upayogikkunnu
OH MY GOD🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
very happy for Messi but the defending in this game looked abysmal. Hope its not a true showing of MLS defensive quality
Miami has a goalkeeper, Philadelphia no.
Messi scoring outside the box is rear, let alone from such a distance. Laser-beam precision.
MLS is not a league 😂. WTH is this? There’s no competition
Cầu thủ già ở tuổi 36 trong 1 tháng đã thay đổi xếp hạng đội cuối bảng thành không thể cản, làm cho giải MLS trở lên sinh động trên toàn thế giới. Đến từ Việt Nam
Messi is Messi but can we take a second to appreciate that first-time through ball by the Philadelphia player at 1:20
At first I didn't like these boring-ass rhumbnails, but i didn't watch the game, didn't know the score, and I really enjoyed the video. Well done 😁👍💙🤍💙
great saves by Callender! black day for Blake!
the game is not as close as everyone making it out to be after the 3 goals Inter Miami just played back and run the clock
MLS is so so rigged😂👎🏻
ميسي افضل على وجه الارض😎
what is the goalkeeper doing bruh
5 Penalty for Argentina in worldcup,paid referee in Barcelona and rigged Mls for messi, so you guys  still consider him as a goat
goal keeper too lousy
You could tell Philadelphia is a good team. They just lack end product
Philadelphia looked like they were playing with out a goalie everything and anything was going in  they should really consider finding a new goalie
Impact of Messi on team morale is phenomenal. This is the same InterMiami who lost 18 games in a row and now look at them!!!!!!!!
Why is the replay of a normal goal shown over a minute wtf who needs that
Lionel Messi has scored 9 goals in 6 official games since he joined Inter Miami 🇦🇷🇺🇸  …guess how many goals at the end of the season 🕺🏼
الكورة في امريكا مثل المصارعة الحرة ، مسرحية تمثيل 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Messi makes the players around him play even better.
nice win
Calendar what a save
who is calender🤯🤯🤯🤯
This was a very weird game. Miami had only 5 shots the entire game while Philadelphia had 16.  The first three goals were defensive mistakes. The 1st goal Busquests was being man marked and he pulled the midfielders with him to the centre allowing the CB a clear run in the middle with no pressure and a great finish from Martinez. The 2nd goal again the same CB runs into midfield with no pressure gives the ball to Martinez gets fouled the ball comes to Messi and he had three players around him but they allowed him to run through. They probably expected him to pass to Taylor in LW but still the lack of press allowed Messi to pick his spot from such a great distance. It was just a precise shot. The 3rd goal was even more bizarre with everyone just watching Taylor turn and twist around, not a single defender tried to get near him nor did they check Alba's run on the left hand side. That was just an easy goal from a schoolyard mistake. The 2nd half was very different. If it wasn't for Callendar Philadelphia would have scored 3 or 4 back. He made two good saves in the first half and then a ridiculous save off the header in the 2nd half. Philadelphia changed their formation brought an extra striker in with 4-4-2 diamond formation. It was attack after attack from Philly. Just wave after wave of balls being pinged into the box with 3 or 4 players waiting for it. They missed a lot of good chances during that 20 minute period after 60 minutes had passed where Miami had no answer just sit back and defend. A lot of shots went over the post, got deflected, there were open chances where the goalkeeper was off the line where they missed the goal. This would have been more like the Dallas game if they had taken their chances.
The Goal of Messi reminds me of the world cup goal against maxico ✌️🔥🐐
Inter Miami is playing it like a video game 😂
Man Messi changed the entire team... I can't believe it's inter Miami ❤️
horrible goalkeeping that shot from messi can easily savable by any average keeper .
great performance by Callender
Match fixing 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
Mls = Messi League Soccer
99% Messi comments lol who cares about the other junk players 😂
Bro is just playing fifa on easy mode
If you love Messi, show some love here
Đỉnh cao thế giới. MESSI là tinh hoa của bóng đá thế giới. Từ khi Xavi giải nghệ, MESSI mới được đá phạt, chia bài, kiến tạo, thoát pressing, key pass ... đều tiến hóa đến thần sầu. Đừng xem thống kê bàn thắng mà hãy xem MESSI thi đấu trực tiếp rồi dùng tư duy bóng đá ra cảm nhận mới thấy sự khác biệt mọi thiên tài trên thế giới. Nó biến hóa, ảo điệu, đầy sắc màu ... và toát lên vẻ đẹp tinh hoa của bóng đá.
Burger 🍔 league full rigged
Hold on, where all the hater that say Inter Miami will get crush???😂😂😂
Messi
I am so happy for Messi and Ronaldo now. They deserve this happy ending. ❤
UFC Commentary 👍😃
3:57
It's a solid prove why messi is the goat  , he can just change the environment of the team if you just let him talk and let him lead the team, he can won the world cup with an average team and he can won with lowest position team against tough teams, love you living legend ❤❤❤
OMG Leo Messi 🫣
No one is talking about how Philip are missing open goals😂
MLS Messi leauges soccer ⚽
All are boosted because of my legend💓🖤
I love it how the coaches and managers be celebrating whenever Messi scores 😂 it's like they coached him xD
Garbage goalkeeper making them look good lol
OK
inhuman reaction by callender hahaha
The MLS is FIFA on amateur mode. This won't be entertaining for long. Unless you like watching kids get bullied by a superteam 😂😂
As a Messi fan, what is that keeper doing
this is bullying 😂 european legends barely out of their prime in the MLS
Yard League
seems like Philadelphia players were saving all their goals by clearing them above the goal post😂
Miami GK saves the day
Messi Jordi and Busi really improved this team
Philadelphia missing 3 Clear goal chances, I wonder how they even got this far
King messi
Messi ❤❤❤❤❤
Philadelphia's keeper 😂😂🤣
Wish the matches were earlier 1 AM I can’t see. This was probably one of the worst matches of the philly keeper, he could have safe 3/4 goals if he made better positional decisions
Lol. Philadelphia missed so many empty nets😂
Masterpiece (Messi)
Vamos inter vamos Messi. 🇦🇷🐐💪
It's almost unfair to have messi, busquet n alba in the team 😂
is this Match for real😂😂😂 Goals Are so Easy to score in MLS they don't press and Even left too much space😂😂
CALLENDER IS INSANE
Messi and alba on the playground. The defending and keeping on those goals are laugable.
Looks like Blake was off his game
What stadium atmosphère !!!!!What a long shot from Messi😱😱OH MY GOSHHHHHHH!!!32 meter : A TRUE SHOTGUN!!!
Indonesia Hadir 😅
I’m sorry but the Messi has exposed mls for being such a dead end league🤣 the quality REALLY drops
I’m a union fan and this is the worst game we’ve ever played. Blake was nowhere near up to his usually high standards and it’s sad that people won’t see that side of him and insisted ridicule him. Curtin and the rest of the coaching stuff also stunk with the starting 11. Donovan over Uhre is not what we needed, nor flach over mcglynn, or the 5 at the back. If we weren’t so afraid of the game and could actually act like we normally do in a championship/semifinal game we could have potentially won. An off day all around, and it’s sad that Miami fans can’t see the real Philly union
Philly’s goalkeeper is GARBAGE
Dre calendar might have to be USAs keeper
Kesabaran yang membuahkan hasil...Martinez mendapat dukungan dari rekan team karna akan tiba waktunya unjuk Gigi
Let's goo Miamiiii. Get that trophyyy
The positioning of the goalkeeper 🤣
wtf is the MlS? lol iv seen before defenders play who aren't even pros.
shouldve shown more of the taylor alba clip. He made a great defensive play to start it.
mls is scripted
Messi has to be the greatest football mind ever. Look at the first goal by Martinez. He basically conducted it.
Are you all b***es...!!!???can't stop a little man...😂😂😂
Buy Philadelphia a Goalie...
That block against Messi in front of goal by that Philadelphia defender was epic. That should have been part of highlights. Messi's face said it all. What I learnt from that particular moment: No matter how hard things have been... Never give up, keep trying. Miracles do happen. Keep your spirits high. If not today, tomorrow will be better.
This League is a joke fr
Tf? Busquets too?
Lionel messi goat of football ⚽️
🎉🎉🎉
Qatar's gk
What a Drama 📽️🎬
Inter Miami needs a more quality midfield and defence...What happens if messi and the Spanish boys get injured
Philadelphia goalkeeper is really interesting 😂😂
Messi no have braves to arab league
MLS MESSI LORD Of SOCCER
I wont be surprised if Messi scores 40-50 goals in the MLS next season. He is playing with children
Messi would have harder time in Saudi Arabia. MLS is such a bad league
Bravo inter Miami 👏
I like how the subtitles keep saying Calendar when the commentators calls the keeper's name
This is now a TEAM ❤ Everyone played their part. Amazing. Goal Keeper probably man of the match. Messi... ridiculous goal.
What the fudge brownies Messi goal is actually godly
It’s Inter Miami cup
0:33 Messi giving direction that lead to the first goal. Fantastic pass though 🤩
মেসি ! একটা নাম যথেষ্ট 🤍🤍🖤🖤
I have never seen such atrocious defending in my entire life. Especially for Alba's goal. WTF was that?
Philadelphia union absolutely suck 😂😂😂
Seriously different level of soccer.
MESSI GOTTA WIN THE TROPHY!
Too way for Messi here 😂😂😂😂ngl
Messi
why did they takedown the first video??
This American "soccer" is too easy for Messi😂😂
That firepower is amazing! I don’t see anyone stopping Inter Miami 🎉
This proves one thing. Even Footballers in the US are highly overpaid. The amount of missing chances to score a goal is too damn high. I'm used to watch better quality of football. The missing chances make me angry
31.8m distance 😁  Messi still remain brilliant. He saw the wrong positioned goalkeeper who was also panicking as well. 😂
Another Magical moment by the GOAT
Leo10❤
At Last.. Final..👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Lionel " Dr.Strange " Messi         VS CaptAin " AmeriCA " Zimmermann . Inter MiaMi Magic vs NashVille Knights.. Who Will Be the King..?🏅🥇🏆 Greetings From West BorneO,Indonesia ..
That new kid number 10 should probably be defended.
I love messi
I know Messi’s rightfully getting most of the attention but Inter’s keeper is something else! 😮🙆🏽‍♂️🔥🔥
POLAND
Querétaro hubiera jugado mucho mejor que estos de Filadelfia, caramba pareció que se regalaron.
The room is given to Messi on field shows a lower quality of players in this league compare to Europe 😀.
what a goolkeeper :( 🥲
Why the reupload?
Philadelphia needs a new goalkeeper
Every miami game is entertaining!
😊
Messi is out there completing sidequests and stat achievements
Goat in final
Even if Messi Loses against Nashville which is an incredible fairy tale team story as well..he has already done far moree than anyone expected of him..win or lose, he is the best of all Time, screw his 9 goals in 6 games..he is inspiring and making everyone around him even No name players into all stars..t
Messi🥂🐐🐐 The goat effect on entire team is just fantastic 😍
Apart from messi brilliance, its good to see jordi alba score
Robert Taylor = Kevin De Bruyne ?
Whoever is writing this script, needs to stop!
the things Philly was missing is insane
Messi😮🥺
burger league it is😂😂
Türk butonu🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Philly has been 1 of the more consistent winners in MLS since Jim Curtin took over.  The Union hadn't lost a game at home all season.  & Miami just crushed them.  The rest of the league should now officially be afraid; very afraid.  Team defenses must be built up immediately if not sooner; Lord knows some of them have had plenty of time given their early exit from the Leagues Cup.
💯💯
goat.
Serguiy Krivtsov - the best defender! One assist and one pre-assist are excellent for central defender
The Impact of Messi in this club is unreal. He went to the weakest club in the league but turned it into one of the best club with winning Mentality just like he did with Argentina
Empty stadiums in the majority of MLS markets and Beckham brings Messi to play against players who aren’t quite up to the task. We’ve already seen this play and how it ends.
Dep,qua,
Honestly out of all the great football players in the world, messi probably is having the best, what could potentially be, his final seasons
Phiadelphia keeper was terrible
I mean I don’t want to take anything away from this Miami Team but that was way to easy I mean that defense might be the worst I’ve ever seen in a match
They are doing well with messi helping the attack. But Those defenders need to step up.
Wow
what’s happen with union defenders, even they didn’t try to stop the ball 😅
in mls all the keepers are on english 5th league level or worse... 🤣
Dale Messi
This is amazing, this goal is similar to the one in the 2022 World Cup against Mexico.
No doubt Messi is GOAT but what really surprise me is how Messi inspires each in the team to be a better or even great version of himself.
What or Who is Philadelphia when you are playing against the GOAT
Messi is putting on a show for them every night. phenomenal
MESSI ❤
Amazing game
Messi hizo que el Inter Miami pasara de ser un equipo perdedor a ser un equipo dominante y de temer, y ya estan a punto de ganar su primer titulo, simplemente disfrutemos del GOAT 🐐
Messi 9 goals 1 assist in 6 matches, and also Jordi Alba scored his first goal in MSL with Inter Miami.
Phiadelphia hoy se vio como un equipo chico 🥴 existe una gran barrera cuándo juntas jugadores de renombre jugando en Europa contra jugadores de MLS que siguen siendo amateurs.
The goalkeeper did a great job today 👍🏻⚡
Messi 🐐 Ronaldo 🐪
The pass at 1:19 is crazy
That Callender goalkeeper is good. Also Messi's goal was ridiculous. 33 yards, bottom left corner oh my god the accuracy.
WHAT A GOALKEEPER
🐐
The MLS is officially on notice! Before you could maybe say that they have played mid-table to bad teams. But Philly is THIRD in the same conference where Inter Miami is FIFTEENTH! ⚽️🐐
gacor kang
🐐
Sorry I don't follow American leagues but is Philadelphia union division 1 league team?
So happy for Messi, Busquets, and Alba. Undefeated and enjoying life.
🐐 GOATED GOATED GOATED
5'7 I'm Messi girl
That's a fantastic goal and for those blaming the goalkeeper, watch his first goal vs Mexico in world cup 2022.
Man!!.. Messi's arrival at Inter Miami/ MLS is like a fairy tale!.. He literally transformed an average team into a much formidable team!!.. Champion 🏆 mentality!!!...
It's absolutely a completely different team. 22 goals in 22 games, now 21 goals in what 5 games?
Goalkeeper is from Sunday league? 😂😂😂
This is like some anime and Messi is the main overpowered character who went to isekai or something😱😱😱
Messi ❤🐐 👑
Glad to see the result but the defense is so weak, they need world-class defense to improve and compete on the world stage.
MLS most be scripted. How else could Inter Miami playing this good in such a short time, because of just one man?.. 🤔🤯
Giving credit to messi is very important for the change in this team . But also do not forget the team as a whole has improved bcoz of busquets & jordi alba . These 3 are the reason why the team has become so strong . Not just Messi
Is kinda crazy how a player can totally change a 13 game winless team.
Amazing Goal From Messi 🔥🔥🔥
Wow, Philly just...sucks.
World class save by the Miami goalie!
Mls need to step their game up
Am I crazy to think that Inter Miami might be the best team in MLS?
Messi League Soccer
Did anyone else notice Messi giving the "Through Ball overhead sign" that leads to the first goal???   Unbelievable vision
The one and only GOAT
Philadelphia Union should've easily won this game. They were very wasteful and paid the price.
🎉The best ever has done it again 🎉
Messi at this moment is basically toying Mls.😂
Martinez never got to see Messi's goal live 😅😂
Destroyed in the home ground 😅😂
MIAMI qualified for the Concachampions, this is great. Who would say that the team lifted so much and found good performance? Marvelous. There will be a very tough and even battle with Nashville (great team) where both have a chance to be champion, but what Inter did in this competition is very good
Damn... wtf... Messi got me watching MLS... never thought I'd see the day
Lol don't they coach defending in MLS?
The match is fixed Look at the philadelphia goal keeper
Fantastic long range goal from  🐐🔥
Absolutely awful goalkeeping making Messi look way better than he actually is. The shot for that Messi goal. Absolutely no power in it... Terrible keeping
Es una falta de respeto total que silben a Inter Miami.. Por consiguiente  a Alba,  Busquets y Messi. No entienden de futbol.. Cuanto mas los hagas enojar.. Peor para los contrarios
I'm glad Miami is consistently winning by 3-4 goals. It makes me feel a lot better when I score a hat trick in FIFA with Messi every game.
Im here for messi ❤
Messi is happier in Inter Miami than being in PSG makes me smile.
one more step a champion❤❤❤❤
Messi making mls historic moment
Messi makes everyone else better on his team, because he also brings fear in the majority of his opponents hearts.   THIS WHAT TRUE LEADERSHIP  & TEAMWORK LOOKS LIKE.   Shine bright enough to blind your opponents, while his teammates uses that same light to better themselves in their own way.   Such a beautiful, egoless exchange. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Messi❤❤❤
Messi is The GOAT 🐐
ليو ليو
Philly goalie sucks
마이애미 전부 얼굴에서 미소가 떠나질 않네.. 레알 행복축구!
“And the Philadelphia Union, they have been the most consistently excellent team in Major League Soccer this decade. The most points, the most goals scored and the fewest goals conceded sense 2020 - *concedes goal*”
Messi What a goal 😮
Messi doing what Messi does best, spreading joy in MLS just like he's been doing for decades in Europe. Loving every moment of the MLS matches.
Messi has scored and been MVP in every match he has played for Inter Miami…at 36 years old. MLS is under the King’s reign
Messi scored a goal which i cant even score in fifa
A la Final 🎉🎉🎉
I love that MLS does not spoil the score in their titles!!
Propers to Callender man, what a goalie
Messi looks more comfortable than psg. Who wait for 2024 copa&2026 wc. Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Although Messi deserves all the credit he gets the Goalkeeper is SEVERELY underrated. He has been absolutely brilliant so far.
Man its seems like a whole new squad from the debut match.
Miami's morale is getting higher match after match
sorry but worst goalkeeper I've ever seen
How can't you enjoy football playing like that; Beckham choices have turned Inter Miami to a Barcelona like 😍😍😍
insane goal by messi👏👏👏
MLS = Super Lionel Messi
Messi got his shin guards on the wrong leg 😂 5:27
what am i watching omg!!!
What! How did Messi score that? Bro he’s the goat
Jordi Alba 🐐🐐🐐
I mean great attack but we gotta show respect to Callender for saving this game💯🎉
2:25 announcer is in disbelief lol
That's the influence of Leo Messi ,  see how my GOAT just changed the whole Inter Miami. Let's enjoy my GOAT because trust me  you won't see anyone like him again. He is the point of difference.
Messi the goat 🔥🔥
That's Miami in the Champions Cup. Win that and he leads them to the first expanded club world cup.
La diferencia entre el Inter Miami y el PSG es que los chicos de Inter se entusiasmaron con la llegada del mejor de todos los tiempos y eso se nota en la cancha. Los conos del PSG no, bien merecida la final para el Inter!
The King L.Messi
When there is Messi everything is possible ❤.Messi makes everything look easier
Que guapo el equipo de Messi y el más inclusivo con un N-palabra, un Ucraniano y un Venezolano 🫡🫡🫡🫡
GOAT ❤
If Philly capitalized on any of their other million chances.... this game should have been so much closer.
Undefeated. 🇵🇭👏
Messi Magic
All eyes on MLS, on Inter Miami. The progress the team has made is colossal! They ve started to believe and to create back to back with the Only one! My goodness, Leo, do not stop!!!
No puedes ir por encima del Inter Miami en liga y meter línea de 5 en este partido 😂 Asustados estaban en Philadelphia
Leo nih bos
We might have New England Patriots 2007 in the second half of the MLS if people are sleeping.
hey, did they re-upload this video? 🤔
The impact Messi has had on Inter Miami is insane!   His arrival along with Busquets and Alba motivated all the players and got them into great form.
Messi scoring a goal that we probably score with him on FIFA by just pressing the shoot button and hoping it goes in.. absolutely beautiful and precise goal.. Just 🐐 tings
Messi
🐐 just enjoying play ⚽
They had plenty of chances to come back. It’s easy to forget because of the result but it could’ve easily went badly for Miami

Without Messi nobody would have saw MLS game. The 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐, the 👑👑👑👑👑
keeper is a part time dominos delivery guy
That’s got to be the worst keeping I’ve ever seen.
32.2 meters away from the goal post - his longest career goal ever… magical  Edit: 31.8 m - his 2nd longest career goal. Still magical
Callender is EXTREMELY Underated
I guess Philly team just did not want to win today. They missed so many opportunities
Ảo thuật gia, đội trưởng Leo Messi
they will win it. The league cup 💯💯
Messi made inter Miami the new Barcelona
