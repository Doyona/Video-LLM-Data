"the show of the recipe" but I think you meant STAR of the show or star of the recipe AHAHAHAHA
My boyfriend has a boy cousin   name   Louise  Nathaniel  gabriel  Eron  juries
like this if yur watching in novembi 2024.
I remember a long time ago you caught me and my cousins watching your YouTube videos in Buffalo Wild Wings😭
I think you needed more parsley 🌿 but anyway luv you
0:31
Louie is me saying agragar instead of agregar 😂💀
Me about to do this recipe
Love seeing you post more on yt 👏👏
Ima try this out 😝😝😝
soften butter is just mixed/beaten or wisked butter
That looks bomb stop 🥴
That does look hella fire!!! Even try dipping it in a little bit of marinara sauce!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😋😋😋😋😋
Amazing ❤❤❤
This Gave Me Old Louie Vibes In The Best Way Possible 🩷💜
“le voy a agragar”😹😹😹 5:53
Your kitchen 😍😍😍😍
🔥
It’s because you melted the better that’s why it’s watery 😂😂😂
That looked really good.  Gotta try it🤗Blessings you this holiday season.  ❤️❤️🙏🙏
When Travis said “imagine they all throw up” 😂😂😂
Random but is there anyway you could do a boyfriend Q & A with Fernando?? I already have a questions to submit, "who reach back out to who first", "who said they missed the other first" etc 😆. I truly feel like you guys will get married some day ♥
I LOVE UUU NEVER MAKE ME FAIL TO LAUGH😂😂
Wtf i just watched the butter face episode on shameless 😂😂😂😂 ifykyk!!!
Is it just me or am I the only one that loves his kitchen ❤
6:47 the slappp 😭😭😭😭😭
Dear Louie, I wanna say Thank You. Thank You for being such a funny content creator. I’ve been watching for a while and it’s amazing to see how you have grown so much. I checked my Spotify Wrapped and Pretty, Not Smart was no.1 with a total of 216 minutes and top 27% fan. Thank You so so much
I love when u act like RASFUSHA😂☠️🤣
Can we talk about the “diced” parsley 😭😭💀💀💀
💯💯❤️❤️😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
6:26 i’m no chef or anything but i’m pretty sure softened butter means room temperature so the butter literally has to be soft 😭😭 that’s probably why te quedo all soupy cause you melted it lmao
Yummy I believe this garlic bread must be good because your whole family loved it …. It looked good
Louie is hilarious he made garlic bread. Wow big deal.
I love how your kitchen looks like!! 💜 I'm also gonna be trying that recipe!!
Louie you should make a cooking video with Daniela Rodrice
Not my high ass just got closer to the screen when he said “ look at this shit” 10:10
Louieeee you look hella good and made me giggle when you was heating the butter uppp hahaha
Did I miss something? When was he on Reality House?!
You melted the butter vs having it just soft. That's where the paste consistency comes from jejeje regardless you did amazing looks delicious!!
Reality house season 4??😫😭If there ever going to come out with new season I hope you’ll  be on ituuhhhhhh!!! 🤪
LMAOO when you were talking shit to the brushes 😂😂😂😂
The rasputia voice😆😆😆
Love you 😍
It was watery cause u put in microwaveuuhhh tip for next time use ur body to soften it, ur body heat will soften it.
Love how you’re wearing your reality house shirt Louie !! 🥹🫶🏼❤️
Your video is #20 trending Louie🥹💜!!!!
19 on trendinngggUhhh
Ella has the cutest eyes ahh she’s so adorable !💕
Louie you looked like a boxer when you took out the bread from the oven  anyway love you and your videos ❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤
I can’t WAAIITTT for a house tour . Loving the kitchen ssttuuppiidddaaa ❤❤
You did put too much butter. You melted the butter. There’s a difference between softened and melted butter. You should have left the butter out for a few hours before you made this.
“Yurrr do it” 😭😂😂😂 TOOK ME OUT
I genuinely love you louie ♡ your so funny 😅 I love you cooking videos. 😊
Dude your such a good YouTuber, you entertain so manny people this is the platform you started and it’s so sad how you don’t post as much 😭 I love watching you and literally you posting makes my day !! ❤️
It wasn’t too much butter, es que la derretiste 😅 hehe
That’s cooking not baking 😂
Wow your dish looks delicious
Ok hear me out. You need a YouTube segment of testing other people’s recipes. So pretty much you look into YouTube videos of recipes other YouTubers make, like cooking YouTubers. You write everything down, get the ingredients and invite friends and family over 1 by 1  For example. Invite yoatzi and copy 1 recipe from someone. In the video it will be “TRYING _____’s soup recipe” and you give them the shout out for u getting their recipe from their channel . Do the recipe and taste it. Was it a success?? Or a fail. A fail means you did something wrong or it didn’t taste good. And the fails would be so funny to the viewers and the success means they’ll try it at home ❤️ that would be so fun to watch. And each video invite someone new or by urself. It doesn’t have to be everyday or weekly, they’ll be just randomly
Laughing throughout this whole video 😂 the paint brushes took me out 💀
I love watching you’re videos can you try and do vlogmas this year 🥰 hope you had a good thanksgiving also where is Addy and Lauro ?

You melted the butter too long. Always microwave for less time. You can heat more, but you can't take it back. So like 5 seconds at a time.
Bro Louie never fails to make me laugh 🤣🤣💜
