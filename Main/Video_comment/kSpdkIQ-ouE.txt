Mistaking a hanging coat for a murderer in your house is WAY too accurate!
My brain make me hallucinate a a humanoid figure with Black skin, like the absense of color not the race, with no facial features that jumped out at me. It did it twice in twenty minutes, so I turned on the lights and nothing was there, not even something resembling it. I thought someone was in the house
My brain at 3 a.m:   “…Did you ever realize that being able to die of old age means that everyone you love/care about now will either be dead or no longer friends with you more?”
Wait, you actually get to SLEEP before this happens? Why am I stuck staring at the ceiling for hours instead? Jealous
I had that with my jacket and I knew it was a jacket. Still it looked WAY too scary man.
Do you ever think the thought of endless time through and get absolute chills?
This could not be more real
Me every night
I just realized Ryan was Canadian
Brains are jerks period.
You know it's not 3am when you wake up and turn on your mobile flash to see if you are actually alone or some YouTube IceBerg Entities have entered your room I still remember being traumatized when I saw Soup . AVI video I lost sleep for days when I was young It was a Hoax.. And the memory part is true  A cringe memory always a core memory
😆😂😆
Ryan George looks like Wayne Static in the dark.
Brain: "we're way too hot under the covers" Me: *kicks off covers* Brain: "you can't do that the monster under the bed is going to get us" Me: "we're not a child anymore we know there's no such thing as under the bed monsters" Brain: "there definitely are under the bed monsters! Do you want us to die?! Put the covers back on!!!!"  Me: *pulls covers back on* "happy now?" My autism: "hate to be that person but this blanket's really itchy" Me: "oh fu-
My brain at 3 AM asks things like "Could Homelander beat Shadow The Hedgehog 1-on-1?"
this was suggested to me at 3 am 😂
I'm watching this just past midnight.
This high school memory felt personal, poor ryan 😂
Stupid cortisol... I had a bad business relationship and there was a bike rider who rode past my house at 2am. Thought it was my ex business partner and could sleep for 1 hour. Even though I knew he had motorcycle accident and couldn't have been him I kept thinking it was him. The brain is stupid at times. 😅
What are you doing in my head?
This inspired me
"Everyone we know is gonna die one day"- Brain Ryan, shrouded in darkness.
1:22 The staring really sent this point home (and made me lol)
0:17 He looks like a horror movie villain in that light
So this is what over a million years of natural selection produced....
A little over 3 years later, Ryan has finally gone for a jog
“It’s a jacket, it’s a coat.” Top 10 best inventions
“Yeah you see that shadow there?” “Yes?” “That’s a guy now. He’s in our home and he wants to murder us.” “Oh no. Let me just-“ “No” “What?” “ *Brain Used Paralyze!* “
My brain when I go to sleep: "We're falling now, better wake up."
The accuracy 😂
So, you have a thought for me? Yes sir, I do.
Going to sleep every night I can confirm this is exactly how brains are at 3AM
My brain at 3AM: "Would you like to have an existential crisis?" Me: "No!" My brain: "One existential crisis coming up!" Me: "I said no!"
😮😅this literally just happened to me  except 3am is when i fell asleep but woke at 6am i dont need to be up till 11am 12pm ....struggle
Literally was my night last night just 15 min earlier, lol
I have two big chairs in my room, one time I was sitting in one and I turned around and saw the other one. Thought it was a big scary person and nearly fell off said chair
This was literally me last night...
"Why'd you say it twice it wasn't funny" "Well nobody reacted how i was i supposed to know"
With ADHD it’s worse
Omg it's 9 minutes til 3pm I'm getting scared
3:00 AM is the demonic witching hour. Once I woke up at EXACTLY 3:00 AM sensing something evil in my room.
When YouTube recommends this video to me at 3AM, how can I NOT watch it. 👀
Why we as a person and our brain are 2 different personalities 😂
omg I thought their was something wrong with me that I remember in vivid detail horrible moments in my life to the point I can actually feel the pain/humiliation of something that happened 20 years ago. now I know were all crazy! I feel better ty!
Do you love Jesus? If you want to go to Heaven with him you must repent from your sins and Read and Obey the Bible everyday! You must preach his word to others! Jesus died on the cross so that you can have eternal life! He is the way, the truth, the life, and he will always be! He loves you, God bless!
THIS GUY JUST CALLED HIMSELF A JERK😅
He is bullied by his own brain
It's a coat, it's a jacket
give us more videos my guy
Watching this at 3 am
I can't sleep right now. Lol
Anyone else watching this at 3 am?
This is amazing i have a job interview tomorrow and im watching this at 2 am. Its almost poetic
Ryan’s brain made a video about Ryan’s brain 💀
Why did i read it as brain after jerk at 3 am
That "I know" at the end is shows how many times they had been through fake promises to themselves. So funnily relatable.
Of course theres someone's in the house. We have siblings
Its either a person to murder us or a ghost
I love the way he sinks down into the bed so smoothly. “Oh no no no!” 😂
Why has this never happened to me? When I wake up in the middle of the night, I'm either thirsty of *thirsty* 😏
i wish i could switch my mental state from when i wake up with the mental state of when im trying to sleep. i would be full of motivation and wide awake in the morning and almost comatose in the evenings. that would be great
Cats
It's ALWAYS at 3am for me. Brain: Hey, we should get up and get a snack. Also, there's probably monsters around so if we get up they can't kill us in our sleep. Me: Good point. Let's get up.
I definitely relate to the "that's either a ghost or someone's here to murder us".
This bloke is a friggin genius!!!!
Fun fact that's irrelevant to the video but I had a deja vu while watching this video
Definitely not doing that.
Amygdala...
This it my brain at basically any time of sleeping time plus a  Brain “hey, hey you know are pet he’s so cute right” Me “uh ya he is can we fall asleep before you say-“ Brain “ WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HE DIES! THATS GONA BE SO SAD RIGHT” Me “that before you say that” Brain “YUP ONE DAY HELL BE GONE FOREVER” Me “can you not right now… please” Brain “ya ya fine go to sleep 😒… CRY” Me 😭😴
Butyou want to know the most schocking twist of them all ? ... You were your own brain all allong ! .. That's right you are your own 3Am jerk. I bet no one saw that comming !
Brains are jerks everytime you're idle. And, it's especially worse when you're trying to sleep.
*wakes* Brain: Hey, something is wrong. Me: What? Brain: Nothing looks familiar. We aren't in our room. We've been abducted. Me: How is that possible? Brain: I don't know but I know this is definitely not our room. Time to panic. Me: *panics and gets out of bed and turns on light* Brain: Whoops. It is our room/apartment. Sorry big guy. Me: Idiot.
My brain has been a piece of… one time my brain was being a… and I said to myself “if jellyfish can live without a brain, so can I”
My brain: the clock battery died at 3 a long time ago .
Shut up, brain, before I stab you with a Q-tip! -Homer Simpson
I hate how accurate this is.
My brain: Ohh you should say this without filtering it, it will be funny! 4 sec later My brain: You probably should not have said that.
my brain at 3AM: Hey, you remember that actor? yeah what was his name again? me: I don't care, now shut up and let me sleep! brain:.... me:.... brain: Just google it real quick, will you? pleaase? me: ughh ok, then me half an hour later: *scroll scroll scroll*
How did you know about me? Are you stalking me?! How do you even know who I am?!!! I'm just a nobody! (Made this at 4:15 am btw so I really can relate)
I was wondering if I was the only person who went through that every night lol
RYAN WHEN DID U PUT A CAMERA IN MY ROOM 🤣
Hey @ Ryan George This is me every night, lol
It’s always at 3am
Wow this video was before Ryan’s brain got his own control room.  Neat!
I had shadow demon actually, he was climbed the curtains and was looking at me. He just stayed there so I named him Kevin.
This guy giving my jerk brain sone 3 AM ideas
I've been trying to go on that jog since this video came out, diligently, every single morning, but unfortunately have missed the last 616 times.
The typical thing when you get some water during the night  "AAAH" "WHAT?!" "GHOST!" "GHOSTS AREN'T REAL!" "Oh right."
I thought this was a thing with conjoined twins
My brain at 3:00 a.m.: You want cheese toast. You want cheese toast…..cheese toast. And a drink.
i never get thoughts like that
Carlos Mencia did this first...
😂😂😂
My brain at 3am: did you turn the oven off? You must have, didn't you? Yeah we're probably good. ... Might want to check to be sure but it's probably fine.
He’s right, and not only is everyone going to die , but everyone is dying as we speak 😭
3AM be like: Me: BRAIN FALL ASLEEP! Brain: No, wanna talk about the gas attacks of WWI?
OMG!  Yes.  Perfect play by play of why I get no sleep.  Lol.
This is surprisingly accurate
Ryan! GET OUT OF MY HEAD!  How do you know me well.
Aw geez, I gotta live through that inner turmoil TWICE? HAVE YOU NO SYMPATHY, BEARDED MAN ON MY PHONE?!?
My brain: Hey! Since you can’t fall asleep I’ll read you a story! Once upon a time, a man named Mr. Toe went into a car and drove around until he saw- then your favorite video game character got skinned alive, all your friends died, and remember that one time you did that one awkward thing 7 years ago? Yeah, that was pretty cool! And if you feel bad, always remember that someone will break into your house and kill your family! Right?
Kid Me: oh man. I gotta pee! Brain: A MONSTER IS ON THE HALLWAY, SLEEP NOW!
It's 1:33 am and I'm watching this 🥱
Me: oof, that was a rough day! My brain: you know it, I can’t believe we got so much done today, how’s it going down there body? My body: yeah hi, hello, yeah things aren’t going so well, we probably shouldn’t have exercised so rigorously after working so hard all day, I’m probably going to be sore for days! My brain: oh yeah, whoops! My body: whoopsie My brain: so I’d like to sleep now because I got up for work at 3:30 am, that was like 19 hours ago now!  Me: oh yeah sure, I bet it’ll be easy falling asleep after a day like today! My brain: actually it turns out it’ll be super difficult, quite and inconvenience! Me: oh really? My brain: yes, turns out I’ve got a bunch of bad memories to show and some horrible thoughts about what’ll happen in the future! Me: can we maybe, you know, not do that? You’ve been up for 19 hours too, shouldn’t you also need sleep? My brain: hey shutup, so then I was thinking I’ll do that thing where if you put on some tv to distract you from what I was just showing you I’ll either get super interested in what’s on tv or super bored and demand you change the channel!  Me: that’s not fun at all, I’d rather just go to sleep My brain: so then I was thinking I’ll let you sleep! Me: oh I can’t wait to sleep! I wonder what I’ll dream about  My brain: yeah… so anyway I figured we’ll just skip right past that and not have a dream or any restful sleep at all Me: amazing so do you think I’ll be able to function tomorrow? My brain: I don’t knooow Me: well ok then, good night My alarm: AAAAHHH AAAAHHH AAAAHHH!
Hey brain you got an intrusive thought for me at 3 am? Yes sir I do it's called all your friends secretly hate you.
i got to the 7 am part right at 7 am
Yes, I agree that brains are jerks at 3am.
i misread the title.
I don't think my brain knows we're supposed to be on the team
Instead of sleeping, my brain just constantly wants to watch videos of this guy talking to himself
My brain: Oh no, a minor inconvenience! You should start crying and embarrassing yourself now Me: Why? My brain: Well I don’t know, just do it. Me: but why? My brain: Listen, I need to make you overly anxious at 3am because of things you did in the past so that you suffer every day all day without a single break, and you will be haunted forever. Me: …ok
I read that "Brian jerks at 3 am"💀
with paranoira your brains like this in any situation your the slightest bit vulnerable in.
The First Guy To Invent Sleeping Meds!
This is too relatable, I think you’re reading my mind.
Brain at 3 a.m.:  Hey since we're up, and not dead, how about we go to the bathroom. Me: Sounds good, hard to sleep with a full bladder. Brain: Oh my god!  When was the last time you cleaned the bathroom sink? AND OH MY GOD! Me: What!? Brain: SPIDER!  In the corner!  Oh no wait, false alarm, it's just a dust bunny. Me: Well, crap! Now I'm just fully awake.  Might as well clean the bathroom.
This needs more
PLEASE MAKE THIS A SHORT SERIES!! 😭😭😂👏
Me up a 3am watching this damn video! 🧠🤣
Of course I just watched this at 3:20 am. Stupid brains
my dumbass brain after a nightmare: You died to who you call, The Figure.
Can we get some more of these!?!?
My brain: Hey remember that one horrible image you saw yesterday? Y’know this one?  Me: Weren’t you the one trying to forget that?  My brain: yea
The invention of the panic attack. Brains need an off button.
Hey brain where did I leave my keys that I had an hour ago  brain: fucked if I know Hey brain remember that embarrassing thing happen when we where 14  brain: fuck yes, here's a high resolution replay of it out of left field
So the Amazon LOTR series spends a BILLION dollars and gets all their trailers ratioed into oblivion. Ryan makes this gem for nearly zero dollars and has 140k likes and counting. Love to see it.
I  feel as if your highschool memory was a real story. Thanks. lol
This is currently me
Watching Ryan at 03:15 hrs here in UK….and he’s right!!!😂
Definitely watched this at 3am before needing to wake up for work at 6am. It was kind of meta.
watching this at 1:15 in the morning
GET OUT OF MY BRAIN RYAN. Do it now. I mean it. I will charge you rent. Out. It's 4 am and I really have tons of things to do today.  I can sleep an hour. 😭
This is the most True and most Brilliant thing you ever Made xD
My brain: should we get ready for bed? Me: yes we should. Brain: I don't think so.  Me:you want me to browse either Reddit or Wattpad to read and look at stuff? Brain: yes.  Me: thought so. Brain: Are we insomniacs?  Me: probably.  Brain: that's good, right?  Me: .... Brain: Right? *nervously* Me: ... No. I both love you and am scared of you at the same time.
My brain: hey is there an end to the afterlife if there is than what’s it like to not exist and if there isn’t we have an eternity and we can do literally anything
My brain is always giving a montage of dumb shit I've said and/or done throughout my life...
Do you know that when you have bad thoughts those are demons whispering and when you have good thoughts that's god talking to you you know this right.... It says in the bible , all good things come from heaven (where does that make bad things come)  If you watch Charmed by darkness demons come out at midnight so if you are waking up after midnight and having all these bad thoughts pray to god That he Cass the away
Brians are jerks
😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
My brain at 3 am: " Are you awake?" Me: " Yeah...." Brain: " Good, we need to clean our home." Me: " It's 3 AM. I will wake everyone."  Brain: " After the cleaning we will eat a cheesburger." Me: " Burger at 3 am, are you nuts?" Brain: "Never mind go to sleep, but we will be hungry." Me: " (sigh) Ok, ok. I will eat something, no burger, and do some silent cleaning." Brain: " NOW?, I am tired" Me: "Aaaaaaaaaaaah!"
The trouble with Brain is you’re trapped inside your body with it
Me discovering "Brains are Jerks" at exactly 3am
Brains are lazy, too.
Me at 3AM…. Where the fucks my birth certificate?!
MORE BRAIN VIDEOS PLEASE
“I guess we should go for that jog” “Yeah, we’re not doin that” Accurate af 💯
Something else jerks at 3am…   It’s me… I jerk at 3am
Me watching this late at night 😰
😂😅 omg why is this so accurate
Facts allll facts
God. Not so much the 3am part, but I can really relate to the end. Telling myself I am going to/should do something, then I just don't. Not even like "I should do it tomorrow" then I forget, I'm just like "yeah, a walk would be good right now" as I proceed to get on youtube.
possibly already
Oh, man, I can relate to this so well. Can't count the amount of times my brain starts rehashing all the things I've procrastinated on and still need to get done, while I try to get back to sleep. Also replaying all the stupid decisions I've recently made. I've literally sat up and said to myself; "okay, look, can we maybe worry about all this when I'm up and doing things? I need some sleep here!" Brains can be real jerks at times.
Haaaa unfortunately I know a few thousand times over HOW TRUE THIS IS!!
Always when I close my eyes to fall asleep my brain shows me the most terrifying face like wtf let me sleep.
1:26 Gangsta Paradise note
Me before finals and interviews
So accurate how just random thoughts pop into our heads last night I suddenly started thinking about grizzly bears then my mind went to the bear attack in the revenant
The story of my life's brain...
My Brain at 3 PM:  *plotting and making useless shit that's cool*
I’ve gone to bed early for a job interview tomorrow… this is super relatable. Barely inconceivable. Or something….
happens everytime
If you liked this, can I recommend Foil Arms & Hogg's "Hangover"?
Interesting vid.
Interesting and cool
His brain seems to suffer from terrible boredom whenever it is expected to let him rest.
when you get Bruce Green content from Wish
Me: trying to sleep Brain: Minas Tirith, Rivendell, Mount doom, must destroy the ring...
I woke at 2am and couldn't get back to sleep. Turned on YT and this was recommended to me. Think I at least woke up and scared the neighbors with laughter.
I love your channel keep up the great stuff!
At least there's one thing my brain and I can always agree on, no matter the time of night. I do not feel like going for a run
*brains are assholes..*
My brain gladly leaves me in peace in most nights, but especially before important days, it won't shut up. But at least in exchange, when it makes us both severely lack sleep, it still manages to work in high power mode through that important day. As long as I get to receive a royal sleep afterwards, things are fine. Of not, I am starting to see coats and jackets everywhere. No matter the light conditions.
Me awake since 3am
Did we accidentally swap brains
This.... Is me..... Lol
why is this accurate
My brain at 3AM: hm, yeah protogens spinning makes happy.
Ryan George is the only thing that can make me laugh while I have covid I decided
The brain at 0:23 is right. "Life" and "death" are not opposites. Anything that's "living" is dying. To "beat aging and death," you'd have to die and become a "lifeless" material. There would be no "you"
Ryan acting as Ryan talking to Ryan acting as Ryan’s character (played by Ryan) brain is tight!
my brain at 3m:  demon thing  showed up in fornt bed and  looked at me   then disappered  and there was no coat there
Brains are Jerks at 3am Brain "What's that song you used to sing a few years ago that you liked?" Me I don't remember Brain: WE have to figure it out its IMPORTANT I decided........
Woke up at midnight, and YouTube has recommended this lol
Watching this at 3AM
This is so true also im watching in 3am
My brain: remember when your mom said something weird about SpongeBob   Me: yes I do
Yooo Ryan you are a funny man Lmaoooo
I really need to sleep tonight. Brain: "oh let me start with an itching on your left foot at 3:30 am"
Silly brain talking at night about unimportant almost forgotten things that we wish we could change or never witnessed is tight!
Me: okay let’s go pee, Brain: are you sure you want to do this? Me: I have to, I’m going Brain: make sure to switch on all the lights along the way so that darkness monsters can’t get you. Me: okay let’s do this… *after peeing* Me: okay on my way back I need to switch off all the lights Brain: you know that if you switch off the light you have 1 second or else darkness monsters will get you. Me: getting to my room after turning off the light in the corridor. Brain: quick! Close the doors before they get here!!! Me; *closing doors and switching off the light* Brain: you gotta get to bed asap or you’re dead! Me: *rushing to bed and jumping under blanket* Brain: your foot is not under the blanket, something will grab it… Me: covering my whole body under blanket Brain: okay time to sleep Me: finally… Brain: actually… do you remember that time you tried to hit on a girl but you were SOOO awkward?!
#relatable
Me at 3am: I'm gonna rewatch this video instead of going to sleep.
So glad I know it's not just me. Cept 4am-ish.
Anyone else feel that 'repeated joke from school' story was oddly TOO specific? lol
more pls
One 3 am, my coat looked just like the Grim Reaper. I was relieved when I didn't die. The next night, my brain told me that maybe seeing the grim reaper didn't mean you were going to die immediately, but maybe just soon. It took about a week of me not dying before brain would shut up about it.
The face at 1:22....🤣🤣🤣
Me watching this at 3 am
that is very true, brains are jst a bunch of jackasses, who needs them
Yet brains are all your thoughts and mind so this entire video is just a insult to his self.
Me - Remember where I put my keys! Brain - Yeah, ofc! Those keys are important. Me - Alright. Some time has past. Now I need to go. Where are my keys? Brain - I don't know. You're running late.
This may be the most relatable video ever posted on YouTube Ever
Dude, this is a low-budget by high quality video
😂😂😂😂
What the actual fuck?!? I try to share this video on facebook, and get a "can't post because people have reported this video as abusive"...WHAT THE ACTUAL...}sigh{...what do I expect. People are idiots...
Like my mom says “leave him alone, he’ll be dead in the morning.”
Spot on.
aint this trey kennedy? lol
Haha, jokes on you, my brain is a jerk at every hour of the day 🙃
Yep. Happens to me all the time. I spend the whole day just getting jazzed up to be super-active at night! But then I have to go to bed, and my brain just won't cooperate with that.
"We are gonna get so much work done tommorow my man" "Yeah we are" "Start the day off with a jog maybe get the blood pumping" "Oh yeah absolutely thats a great idea" "I guess we should go for that jog" "Yeah were not doing that" "I know"  So relatable
I'm just amazed that some people are only like this when trying to sleep.  My brain is going like this 24/7
Body: I'm sick I'm tired I need to sleep Brain: good for u I'm always sleepy Body: *2 hours later* So, remember that sleep thing? Brain: yeaaahhhh, about that: ever heard of insomnia?
This is hilarious, and true. Instincts in us from being hunted by sabertooths and such make us naturally suspicious of certain sounds and silhouettes.  Evolution baby.
me: so you have scenario for me? Brain: yes sir i do!
do y'all know how well people would sleep if they ate hamburgers
My brain: Did you turn off the stove? Me: ... My brain: Can't remember 100% can you? Me: ... My brain: We usually turn it off don't we? But what if? My brain: Also did you REALLY lock the door when you entered? Me: ALRIGHT FINE! 10 minutes later My brain: PUH! As expected the door was locked and the stove was turned off! Let's recap everything that happened today and think up scenarios for future possibilities of them. Let's also dive into a bit of thinking about space and other miscellaneous things so that our dreams don't have to do that for us later on. Also, this pillow isn't that comfy, is it? Isn't your head a bit too warm? Aren't you getting... ... 7AM
My Brain at 3am: Hey, do you remember that song? The song that goes like "[sings really REALLY catchy song, but gets the lyrics wrong]". Me: No, that's not how the song goes. It goes like "[sings the song the right way]". My Brain: Oh yeah, you're right. Ok, I'm gonna keep singing now. [Continues singing song wrong.] Me: What? No! You're singing it wrong again. That is incredibly annoying. My Brain: Well, I don't no what to tell you, man. That's the way I'm gonna sing it, and there's no way I will not be singing this song tonight. Me: Uuugggh. Just let me sleep! My Brain: Sure thing. [Continues singing song wrong and ONLY the part the he/it sings wrong.]
I swear u were the screen rant guy.  Or something along those lines.     But u make really good stuff
my disphorpha be like
Me: **on the verge of falling asleep** My brain: "That cute girl from 5 years ago was absolutely flirting with you." Me: **lies awake for another 3 hours**
The worst thing is when the alarm goes off in the morning: Me: "Ok I'm awake. I specifically put the phone on the cupboard over here so I had to literally stand up to get it." Brain: "Yeah that was a great idea, now we can go back to bed." Me: "Dude, that would defeat the purpose. We are standing, lets just go to the bathroom" Brain: "Oh, I'm not listening, I'm sleeping again." Me: "Dude, I'm standing! You can't sleep while I'm standing!" Brain: "Zzzzz...." Me: "I can tell you're pretending you know." Brain: "Come on dude just 5 more minutes" Me: "No, you know that wouldn't happen. We'd go full back to REM state and sleep another hour like it always happens!" Brain: "Yeah it always goes like that, but I feel this time will be different." Me: "How can I be the more reasonable here?? How is this even possible!"
It should have been like: "Yeah, it's not a person. Who would try to kill you nobody knows you anyway you don't have friends"
This is the truest thing I ever did see
"So I guess we should go for that jog..." "We're not doing that." NO SHIT?  REALLY?
Imagine if the brain did exactly the opposite and said soothing things. Imagine this happened for a full month. Literally would be reborn.
The fact that I go to bed late and I get up in the middle of the night to check if my front door is locked this sketch hits home for me. My brain is the same way. It’s annoying
"we should go on that jog" "Yeah we're not doing that" "I know" Relatable
Soooooo it’s like 3:15am and I just woke up from a nightmare and now anxious thoughts won’t leave my head 🤣😥😥😥😥😥
I'm glad im not the only one
"tommorrow"
“I guess we should go for that jog” “Yeah, we’re not doing that” “I know” I died laughing there!
That is basically the sleep meme acted out and I love it! 🤣
i just had the weirdest ad ever. basically a mobile game where you try and catch all the hamburgers as a milf, to raise her booty size... the first ad i didn't pressed skip on
LOOOOOOOOLOLOL I think we have all gotten scared of a random object before
I busted out laughing so hard the second "the brain" showed back up at 3 am.. that's me bro 😂😂😂
That's so true😂
I relate VERY hardcore to this.
did you know that humans arent made or supposed to sleep through the night all the way through. you wake up once a night. some more, some less. in ye olde times, people used that time to pray or think of other stuff, until they fell asleep again.
Hey it's screen rant
LMAO!!!
smh so true sadly
0:29-0:47 is so relatable.
I obsess all day about the problems I ever had, currently have, and ever will have. That's why I'm able to sleep so fast and so well! This way I'm rested to ruminate all day again the next day! Try it!
The highschool joke fail is so relatable. Remember that stupid thing you did 11 years ago that nobody but you remembers? Let's feel embarrassed about that for a few a hours.
You kind of remind me of John Mulaney with that delivery and I live
me: In bed. Finally about to fall asleep. Starting to nod off.  brain: *DID YOU LOCK THE FRONT DOOR?*
Me every night.
😆😆😆
The dying this is the truth that's exactly what my brain does
Man everybody gonna die and i look at my dad and was like 0_0
Body: Man that was a rough 12 hour shift, gonna go to bed early to rest and recover. Brain at 3am: Time to get up after only 4 hours! And I’m super charged so that you won’t be able to go back to sleep!
My brain at night: thinks of literally ANY reason to keep me awake.
My brain every day.
My brain: Me dreaming of something happy like maybe I found a unicorn brain: THE UNICORNS ARE GONNA KILL US. LOOK OUT SEE THAT DEMONIC ONE! Me: Imposible brain; RUNNNNNN
The human brain evolved in such a way because it was very advantageous back then. If we saw a bush as a bush and a bear as a bear without any bias, we only need to be not careful enough in our observation once to get killed by a bear. But, because of the strong bias that makes us think everything unknown(Fear of the dark) is always trying to kill us all the time because they have no hobbies other than to make us not very much alive anymore (which may even be lethal in some rare cases), we'd only assume a bush is a bush when we're VERY certain that it is and otherwise just default to RUN. It's potentially not-alive making to mistaken a Bear for a Bush once in a 100 times, than to run from bushes 1000 times.  Thank you for your time, you're beautiful and loved.
I lost my breath laughing at this on it's sooo funny 😂😂😂
"Yup. We're definitely not going for that jog. We'll be lucky if we can do our job given that you woke us up at 3:00 AM just so that we can have a panic attack! Stupid brain!"
That’s about right.  Your brain decides to go into overdrive being productive and thinking non-stop at a time you don’t have the energy to follow it up,  and when come during the day when you need it the most then it decides to take a snooze. Also:  Your brain can’t read words in a dream slows you down when trying to run Puts you in compromising and embarrassing situations - naked, in the toilet, etc.. LOVES to wake you up just before participating in a pleasurable erotic dream.
I read this wrong.  I read all Brians are jerks.  My brain did that to me.  Damn, brains really ARE jerks.
It's 3:05 AM
I was not expecting that jump scare in a video about brains being jerks at 3AM
Me: "OK, Brain, I need to catch an early flight tomorrow, so let's bunk down early." Brain: "I've got a better idea - let's just pull an all-nighter!"  My brain is so evil it even tricks me into thinking I'm distracting it. When it started replaying (again) the time Scott Olsen overhead me trash-talking him at the school lunch table, I tried changing the subject - and ended up lying awake anyway proving in my head the irrationality of the square root of two. Brain 2, me 0.
me at 2 am let me sleep  my brain at 2 am no lets think about stuff like everything ever  me oh my no I need to be up at 5 for work  my brain chill dude thats hours away just let me stay up and chill me at 5 am okay its time to get up for work  my brain at 5 am fuck dude I'm trying to sleep!
I'm super late to this, but this happened recently:  My wife wakes up at 2am having just been smacked hard in the face. I'm looming over her, pillow in hand, staring at her with murderous intent.   My idiot sleep-brain had woken up slightly, seen her hand curled up in a weird way high up on her chest, and thought it was a giant, pale spider. I couldn't see her wrist, all I could see was her hand near her face. So I, in defense mode, grabbed a pillow, choked up on it to give it good swatting leverage, and smacked her full tilt in the face with it.
"Yeah, we're not doing that." "I know." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can relate!
Brain at 3:01 A.M.  "WERE ALL GONNA DIE!!"
3AM is when I think about going to bed. So, this is more like 10AM for me.
at 3AM Brain: somebody is walking in your room me: who? brain: idk shall we turn on the light? me: no i'm too scared brain: do it me: *turns on light* cat: *meow?*
This is too accurate lol 😂
me watching this at 1 am
At 3am, all the cringey things I’ve done since I can remember start flooding in. That along with winning imaginary arguments go hand in hand
Yep. I remember that…
This is so true... hilarious....
It's a jacket, it's a coat.
Oh god I feel this haha
Perfection! Seriously, my life every night.
Here's a list of all the things you have reason to be bitter and disappointed and disgusted with yourself about and also a list of your deepest darkest existential horror fears:
literally
Keep strong. Dont forget that despite the struggles in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love.   Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world's previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don't think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God's perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says "the soul that sins shall die" - if we break one in thought/word/deed it's as if we're guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans   . The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God's perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn't and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom.   If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. He will help us through the struggle, the stress, and anything we experience in the world. It's about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves, we need Him to help us as it's impossible without depending on His power and instruction).   He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ's death as our own in our place.   He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it.   He doesn't want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can't. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way.   Christ says in John 16:33: I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have [perfect] peace. In the world you have tribulation and distress and suffering, but be courageous [be confident, be undaunted, be filled with joy]; I have overcome the world.” [My conquest is accomplished, My victory abiding.] -  (AMPLIFIED version)   NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER. Regardless of what you've done or what you're going through you CAN make it through Jesus.   If you have any questions let me know xx
Now, we know how children feel;/felt; Well, technically we're those children.
"Is not funny" even is/are funny Every-body w/their "humor"; *Ah yes THAT one's funny.*
Legend states when u can't sleep is/are because u'r awake.
Why do you think I am whatching this video at 03:33 AM? Yep,, the Brain was a jerk again.
Auuugh 3 am- witching hour 😒
This whole sketch is like my real life. Except for me it was my own brother instead of a football player.
Maybe I'm just clueless of any concequences, but now I kinda wish my brain would work like that! XD
Sometimes when I've had a shitty night of sleep and I wake up super early I got a sudden urge to get shit down, I'm never as constructive as when I'm on super lack of sleep.
"do you remember that time you told a joke and no one laughed" 🤣🤣 that's my brain every night!!!
There’s a demon in my room
So much content in 1:40 seconds.
Hahah. Well done sir. Took the pitch meetings formula to a new level
When I was a kid, I wrote a letter to an actress who was on a popular TV show saying I wanted to be just like her character when I grew up. Thing is, the character she played was kind of a bitch who ruined people's lives. She never wrote me back but once mentioned in an interview dumb little kids writing her letters wanting to be like her character. That quote is on her Wikipedia page.
*Awkward thing happens* Me: "Oof, I sure do hope I forget that soon because that was embarrassing." Brain: "Roger. This memory has been stored in priority synapses and will now be a recurring thought at bedtime for decades to come."
Me: Night night. My brain: We're going to get up early tomorrow and go for a jog! Me: Huh? My brain: Yep, an early morning jog! Me: (laughs) My brain: (laughs) Me: That's funny. My brain: Right?
That moment where your brain wakes you up at 3:00 a.m. just to be like "What if the events of Mandela Catalogue actually happened?" and you're like "shut up" and then everything around you is now a potential threat:
Ryan *NAILS* it again! My night brain *HATES* me.
A couple weeks ago, the coats and other stuff hanging in my room were arranged in such a way that it straight up looked like the Grudge in the dark. Needless to say that rearranging them was a good move for my health.
My brain at 3AM: Do you remember the movie Annabelle?
My Brain: Heeeeey, I got some story ideas for you!   Me: Why now and not when I was trying to write?  Brain: Because.   Me: Fair enough.
I thought it was only me.
The random high school memories IS a thing!!!!! 😭
I imagine this is how all of the ideas for bits are created.
Brain:  "you know that fart you did as you were coming out of sleep a bit?" Me: "yes" Brain:"are you sure it wasn't-" Me: "no, I mean yes. I mean, of course I'm sure" Brain: "are you REALLY sure? You wouldn't want to spend all night laying-" Me: "fine, I KNOW it's okay but I'll get up and check... see, no problem!" Brain: "good luck getting back to sleep now sucker!"
For me, the problem isn't my brain; it's the other things. My bladder tells me it can't wait, so I go to the bathroom. Then, when I try to go back to bed, my stomach starts growling because it thinks it's time to get up. I grab a snack to tide it over, but no, it will not be satisfied with anything less than a full meal. Once I'm done, I realize I might as well just stay up because my alarm would be going off soon.
Low risk of a killer but never zero.
That is me. Everyday I tell myself I will study harder and more seriously, but I end up either doing nothing or do the absolute minimum.
Me watching this at 4:32 AM...
Yeah, like when your brain starts wondering if you left DNA at that crime scene where you murdered all those people, right? And you can't get to sleep because maybe you're going to get the electric chair if they catch you, right? Everyone identifies with that, right? Hahaha normal thought, right.
Story of my life
Me:peacefuly living my life My brain: ✨embarrassing memory from 6 years ago✨
More night-brain episodes!!
Why do we just randomly recall humiating, awkward, and/or traumatic situations from sometimes decades ago? I'll be trying to get sleep, and my chest will tighten, and I overthink it... You sit there thinking that people who in actuality probably don't even remember your name are just recounting every terrible situation you've ever been in.... I finally got a degree in political science, and won't even go into politics for fear that something from my past will be brought to light, and broadcast to an even wider audience than my high school cafeteria... So, now all I can do short of spending $100k at least on law school is hospitality, serving, or.... ny worst nightmare... teaching.
oh you forgot this part:  brain: "haha remember that three month project you have?" me: "yeah i'll make sure to sleep well tonight so i can do it tomorrow" brain: "oh no no no" me: "what do you mean" brain: "go do that right now" me: "oh yeah okay-" brain: "actually no we're to tired we'll do it tomorrow" *repeat process for three months*
Me before bed: "Monsters aren't real." Me waking up at 3am and seeing my t-shirt hanging over a chair: "OMG it's a monster!"
This literally happened to me a couple of days ago. I was trying to sleep at 2am and my brain decided to be a jerk and not let me sleep till prob 4. I kept restarting my sleep music at 30 min increments. And I had school the next day so I couldn’t just sleep in to make it up
That’s not your brain that’s Satan interfering with you giving you anger and anxiety or sadness. I just tell him to go in Jesus name and he does.
We need a part 2 or something this is hilarious
more brain vids make BRAIN A RECURING CHARICTER this is so good
Brain right as the lights go out and its bed time: So, say you're going to write your own horror novel. What would be the creepiest thing that you could see over there in that corner of the room? Like, think wide eyes, no pupils, maybe a little blood coming out the eye sockets, gaping mouth, pale skin, maybe in a frilly, lacey dress holding a porcelain doll... What if we did, like, a sort of clown face? Remember that scary story your friend told you about what he saw in the middle of the night at camp? What if you saw those eyes staring at you from over there?
sorry Ryan, but I think you mean that Minds are jerks at 3:00 AM
Me this morning 😬
Aaaand this is why I like to make up an entire movie worth of fantasy adventures in my head and let that play as I'm trying to sleep. Distraction is the key. (Well, at least for me it works...most of the times)
I read this as Brian jerks at 3:00am smh
Happy birthday to this video
That "I know" at the end was so smooth and relatable HOLYYYYYYYYYy
3am brain is harsh. Speaking of 3am brain though, could you do a Pitch meeting about The Thing? (I've been...thinking about it. At 3am).
Watching this at 3:26 AM
My brain when I want to remember something important: I sleep  My brain when I’m trying to go to sleep: Hey you wanna hear about that time when you were trying to remember something important?
Me: "Ok I'm awake at 3am, but I'll be able to go back to sleep as long as I don't think about work." Brain: "Oh right, work! Well, there's that upcoming deadline on that report, there's that embarrassing mistake you made the other day, ....."
I almost felt like I could relate until I realized there would only be one representation for his brain. I need at least 4
this is my life.
So, basically;  Our brains: Oh boy! 3 A.M.!
I once saw slender man at the edge of my bed once during my creepypasta obsession phase
This is what drugs are for
And here i am watching this video exactly at 3.00 AM.
It gets worse when you hit 30 and even worse when 40
Brain: hey you going to sleep Me: yeah now shut up Brain: What if we have a 2 minute timer to live but evey time we breath it resets Me: **fear intensifies**
It’s a jacket it’s a coat
It actually was a person though! 😁
Watching this at 3 am
My brain at 3: Am goes  "Hey remember that scary video you watched, and that one, and that one too?" "Get up from your bed, holy shit the floor is cold, something's gonna get you. Don't go back to bed." "Turn that light off, or it'll turn itself off and scare you."
Algorithm.
As a fellow owner of a malevolent lump of Grey matter, I have this to say. Yeah, DUH.
My brain at 3AM: See that shadow? That could be a monster. That could be a KILLER- Me with a really bad eyesight: Yeah, sure, whatever, there are weird shapes everywhere anyway Killer: Am I a joke to you?
“Is the stove off?”
Have he lost weight? He looks great
brain: yea no i dont want to alarm you but there is most definitely someone watching you from outside your window me: wait what, should i call the police brain: nah we can fight them me: okay, should we atleast turn on a flashlight and see who it is? brain: okay *turns on flashlight* brain: thats just a tree you fool me: what
My brain at 3am bombarding me with doubts and regrets: hey member that time when you were a child and your brother told everyone in your school that you knew karate and you got beat up because of it? Fun times, not like all your unresolved issues with your father which aren't very fun at all are they?
*4 AM* Brain: Goodnight buddy, tomorrow is gonna be great! We're gonna get so much stuff done, gonna wake up early, gonna exercise, it's just gonna be so fantastic. Me: Alright whatever, goodnight. *7 PM* Brain: There is always tommo- Me: Just shut up.
This is so relatable
……………….. y’all’s brains only do this at 3 AM?
Me trying to sleep right now. My brain: Your teacher extended the deadline on your assignment but you definitely should have had it in by now. Me: Thanks brain couldn't you have motivated me when I'm not literally out of energy.
That is exactly like my brain, in fact just a few nights ago I woke up around 2am and went to the bathroom, got back in bed and suddenly starting thinking of something that happened months ago, just a argument I had with someone, and started obsessing about it and couldn't go back to sleep for awhile, in fact I had to play a puzzle game on my phone to make my brain shut fuck up, not fun!   But this was very funny, I always enjoy this channel and when Ryan does those Pitch Meetings on Screen Rant, they better NEVER replace him with someone else, because I won't watch them I will just unsubscribe and stick with his channel!
Morning: SpongeBob Night: Squidward
When you want to punch this guy in the face but its your brain.
"Hey, remember how you turned the stove off and locked the front door and then went back and forth between the two a half dozen times to make sure? We should freak out and get up to check those one more time."
This was taken directly from inside my skull
I LOVED THIS!!!! Honestly laughed out loud :D "Do you remember that?!" Hahahaha
1:10 Ryan just personally attacked me
I cried, I was laughing so hard
Brains are jerks at 3AM.... especially when you are a recovering addict
I hope this channel is being properly rewarded by the YT algorithms
This guy’s videos are so good I haven’t even stopped to read the comments for the last 3 videos!!😂
It's 4am.  I've been to since 3am cause my brain won't shut up.  YouTube recommendations are getting scary
😂 I love this dude. My brain is similar, only less funny and more traumatised 😩🧠
My brain is worse.  And it's 24/7.
Demons.
Brain : there is gonna be a honey bee and kill you Me : really!? NOW 😳😳😳
True
Yup, except for me it's 2AM and I'm like god damn it.
*report  Reason: I'm in this video and I dont like it
I wish my brain said "my guy" to me
Your blanket looks really soft
Wow is this a documentary about me? It’s almost verbatim how my brain works.
Anyone else up at 3am watching this like I am?  (Ahh the YouTube algorithm... How did it know?)
Plot twist: You’re brain is literally on 24/7, only the body rest .
me watching at 3 am
😂 This dude is killing me 😂
God this is so realistic
Yet when 7 am arrives you could just zzzzzzzzz
No way I got recommended this video at 3am 😂
*Me trying to sleep* My brain: Let's start an exetensial crisis! Me: Well that's the night ruined and me staying up to stare at the ceiling pondering my very existence......
This is my brain ALL the time haha
1:32 Yeah! I want to do some jogging......... some day.... not today of course!
You forgot the moment when you turn the lights back off again and NOPE THAT IS NOT A COAT THAT IS DEFINITELY A SERIAL KILLER! ABORT! ABORT!
The fact that all of this video was made by his brain.. Even the idea.
"yeah we are!"
Me watching this at 3:42 AM…
0:16 great opening xD freakin brains
20 secs in and I subscribed 🤣💀
My brain sometimes wait till im nearly asleep before reminding my ass death is inevitable.
My brains at night: hang on... what if we get fired for doing that thing wrong at work the other day??? Oh no, we are so gonna get fired. We should make a plan right now in order to not get fired!! Oh gosh, it's cold, what if we freeze to death tonight?? Oh, did you hear that sound?? It has to be a burglar! Oh gosh, we have a lot to do tomorrow, we should really get some sleep!! ... .... Did I mention that we should really get some sleep???
Man this killed me. I guess my brain isnt the only one
Randomly watching at 5 something am after waking up for utterly no reason
I get this, but because I have no internal monologue, it's a bit different for me.  I definitely do remember the embarrassing moments in life right around that sort of time.
bahahahahhaha this video is so relatable......
Nightshift Brain: Hey wake up it's daylight outside. Me: But I have to sleep for work. NB: Yes but I want to be awake now, I decided. Me: Why now? We've been working nights for 3 years. NB: Oh wait was that a knock at the door? That could be important. Me: No that's the dog. NB: I calculate that's possible but we're going to be awake now in case it's not. Me: You are not being amenable here. NB: Oh can we look at funny stuff on our phone now? Funny stuff is tight!
Kusheen was here...
Could be worse.  About a month ago I was sick and absolutely exhausted.  I went to bed at 8:00 p.m. but my brain just wouldn't go into sleep mode.  Kept me awake until around 5:15 a.m.  Then my alarm clock woke me at 6:00 a.m. to take some medicine, and I couldn't get back to sleep after that.  The night seems very long when you need to sleep and can't.
😂
FOR REAL
my ad was longer than video
That "I know" at the end 👌🤣 Spot on. Priceless 👏👏🤣🤣
My brain absolutely
This is still probably my favourite skit yet 😂😂😂 I’ve rewatched it atleast 12 times now
It’s a coat jacket
Exploding Head Syndrome (a real thing) where the brain throws out a noise while you're about to drift off to sleep. AND it's a noise your brain's recorded so it's familiar and sounds real...........but it's not!
Yeah, I've had all of these before. By far the worst for me are those very intense "I am going to die one day" realizations. Like, you always know that. But there are those moments at 3:00AM when it really hits you hard and blows your mind.
So, is YouTube's algorithm actually my brain recommending the next Ryan George video for me to watch?
I know what that is like and I hate it.  My damn brain is crazy it dont care about sleep when it wants to be busy
Hi, yes, how do I like this a third time?!??
Watching this with 1.25 speed
Very accurate. I’m glad I’m not the only one that looks at the wall and pictures my worst fears at night.
My Brain at 3 am: Do we have Cancer? We're gonna die young and lonely...GOOD NIGHT
Wow, thought it was just me.
Me and my dad love your vids!
🤣🤣
Its midnight, I leave my bed to go to the bathroom I freeze. There is someone in the kitchen I slowly approach, it looks like a child. I turn the light on... Oh just a jacket hanging from a chair.
It’s wayyyy too true
New sub
You think of a perfect comeback to an insult from years ago so you have the same argument with yourself
relatabel lol
Now add the part in morning where the brain ridicules you for not having gotten back to sleep, sooner!!   Also, how are you folks countering that adrenaline rush?? All I know is, get out of bed until bed sounds comfy, again.
You know there is this think called blinking right?
True
Remember that time you were a jerk to that guy for no reason 6 months ago? Yeah, let's dwell on that a bit before you nod off..
Hey, remember that email you were supposed to send to your boss today but you didn't? Maybe you should get out of bed and write it down. Or just fall asleep and forget about it again.
Remember that girl you dumped but then realized should have stayed with her? She's married to someone else that is much more successful than you. Sleep tight.
This is why I don't do shrooms any more.
Am I the only one who saw the spider on his wall at 0:58
#relatable
wait, is the fridge open? shit, what about the stove oven front door what's that banging sound? fine I'll check. maybe I should check again.   it's never necessary
Everyone's 3am brain is my all the time brain..
my brain at 3:00 am:  SLEEP PARALYSIS TIME >:)
As the video went on I was just like YUP- relatable content 101
My Brain read Brian instead and made me wonder for 3 minutes who tf Brian is...time for bed.    ...after 3 more episodes.
it do be like that though
I read it was Brians are jerks at 3AM Then I unconsciously filled in the gaps thinking "Yes, his name's Brian" and we were about to enter a world of Brians being jerks at 3AM. Like one Brian breaking into another Brians house because he decided. I was so sure it was going to be about that. What's wrong with my Brian?
Brain: I SAY WE ANXIOUS TODAY!
Anytime someone asks me what having anxiety be like, I'm going to show them this video. Along with this super accurate song: https://youtu.be/BcMwQPYYKec 🎶I get overwhelmed... In my mind, late at night. Overthinking everything in my life. Just wondering if I'm doing anything right. . .🎶
sooooooo relatible
You just know that last one really happened to Ryan...
Don't use your brain at 3 AM!!11!!11  /s
Don't use your brain at 3 AM!!11!!11  /s
Wow,I accidentally ran across this and it mirrors my own brain at 3am lol
"Yeah, it was just time to panic, I decided."
No it's just processing things from 12 years ago
Me: alright time to go to bed Brain: or you could watch *youtube* Me: why would I do that? ( *2 hours later* ) Me: alright my eyes are never gonna recover if I don’t get off my phone, I really need to sleep Brain: ok Me: Brain: Me:  Brain:  Me: Brain: remember that time you wet the bed at a sleepover in the 4th grade? Me: *WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS?!?!?!*
hello dude , finally found you after the pitch meatings
The bladder : finally a worthy opponent
I have… adapted
Hahahaha so true 🤣🤣🤣
Watching at 3am Can confirm
my brain at 3AM: furry furry furry furry furry furry furry furry furry furry
So true
The memory’s are the hard truth. They are never the good memory’s though
Lmao
I think i misread the title...
Me: (hears family member footsteps outside room) Brain: it’s a murderer ditch the idea of getting water
114,220th like
so good
Not me at 2:58 AM
and to think, that the reason we are so paranoid, is that the monkeys that WERENT as paranoid, were eaten by the shadow in the bushes they didnt worry about. Paranoia is 100 times as scary when its justified.
My brain when i want to sleep: hey remember the time in a class that we don't know at the grade we don't know and it was a subject that we don't they asked something and you answered in a way that only you think you said it in a bad way?
When you think about it, this was all scripted by his brain, even my comment is tought out by my brain.
It funny how he’s says theirs a person to murder us or theirs a ghost so calmly
Oh man. Every facking day
Ugh, way too relatable!
Understandable
I laughed at "We're not doing that" cuz it's so accurate
Yep they really are.
my brain: hey i know your trying to sleep but do you remember that time that your mom left you on your first day of school when  you were like Thr-  me: *silence* yeah  my brain: ok now lets go to sleep now  me: yes finall-  my brain: -in 10 Minutes  me: oh gosh
He just accepts that the brain said no
# problems.that.Intuitives.have
This video is such a clickbait after midnight 🤪🤣
I love how he is talking to his brain.
this is happening to me right now
At 3am my brain is just like this! 😂
I hope I die soon
Agreed
My brain when im alone: Someones watching.
Brains are jerks at any time through the day
It ain't familiar
My brain: Waking me up multiple times a night with a brand new memory or thought. Then wonders why after doing this process the entire week, why we are so tired and pass the fuck out every Friday night.
this happens to me all the time
yeah, that guy never lets me sleep  ; )
Spot on!
I got over scary things at night pretty quickly. No, I didn't grow up, that happened much later. Rather recently in fact.  What I used to do as a kid when I thought I saw or heard something scary was: ignore it. Don't look at it and it will just go away.  Worked every time!     Only problem is that when I had fallen asleep, I sometimes go into a dream that was much freaking scarier than real life.
A comedian films himself as a silhouette for a comedy short and it's more scary than most scary movies.
finally there is a good youtuber on youtube besides myself
This is so accurate.
Me: Hahaha this is funny because his brain is making him remember awkward things.  My brain: Hey remember that time you..  Me: NO!
i can comfirm this is accurate
I can relate to the high school one 😢
Oh....this is only suppose to happen at 3am? >.> my brain didn't get the memo, it hasn't stopped doing this since I was in middle school.
Love your stuff. Do a "drunk me is a jerk"
Did you know that you wake up at 3 usually because something is watching you
I feel way too called out with this.
Need a follow-up about how Brians are jerks.
This is me every other night. 🥲
I hate my brain so much
🥜🥞
😂🤣
Brain: Hey! We need to go get that thing in the other room Body: Oh Yeah.  *walks through a door* Brain: What are we doing in this room? Why did you bring me here? Body: I have no idea.
My brain has this series going on right now. Every night it’s this shit.
Yeah its annoying if youre very tired and youre toughts keep you awake.
XD IM DEAD
Hey Ryan! Ever thought of making a supercut of your shorts? I love binge watching but the constant ads put me down 😅
I need a full length movie of this
That is me panicing about everything my brain keeping me up alot
My brain at 3AM: beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh Me: pls stop this, let's sleep My brain: NO.
Couldnt be a better video to watch at 3am.
Dear insomnia: 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
My Brain: GASP how did you know thats me !!😳 Me: omg !! Trump made the lamp sesion It ether day he is from a dad orange and a human mom...then because the name orange exist (and he will get bullie Front Young) they decide to name him like a fast food breand sow wen he will be' on the top of America every one can bullie him at this age
I hate how much i relate to this
my brain at 3am:  *Remember that crippling embarrassing thing you did as a teenager, that you hid away in the recesses of your mind for years? Let's review it, second by second, in excruciating detail. I've got the powerpoint setup here*
I need at least 6 more episodes of this
I am getting work done. However not as much as I had hoped. Hence, I am leaving this comment as external evidence of this not-so-efficient thing that I am doing.
That just happened to me
My brain at 3am...we need to pee. Be careful of the darkness
It's 3am and my brain is playing tricks on me. And this pops up on my recommended.... Sometimes YouTube has good timing.
Apart from joke, how to actually control these intrusive thoughts?
1:27 This is so me everyday
Ryan: I guess we should go for that jog Brain: Yeah we're not doing that Ryan: I know Me: 😂😂😂
and yet another reason to get drunk every night.
Yes, in the United States, people die ALL THE TIME from agonizing conditions that could have been prevented if they had healthcare…., not to mention even people with healthcare sometimes have to pay 700 dollars a month for a prescription for a drug caused by a completely genetic disease ….. Just because there are some universal health care systems that are poorly set up doesn’t mean that universal healthcare is the problem….. obviously as I’m sure you agree the US healthcare system is the epitome of a gouging greedy corrupt inefficient system that is made way worse by the people implementing it….I mean they created a whole industry called “health insurance” that has the sole job of trying to make sure you are NOT able to have you medicine and procedures paid for, And we pay them for this service!
He’s arguing with himself
This might be my favorite video on this channel
This is your brain anytime you actually need to sleep for something important.  Every other day, it's just as glazed as your windows and the doughnut you had for lunch... do you remember that...?
Fun thing to watch at midnight in the dark
My childhood🤪😂👍
1:10 that actually happened to you didn't it?
Nothing good happens after 10:00 PM
The only thing that would make this better is when talking about going to sleep there's a thought like "if we go to sleep RIGHT NOW we'll get 4 hours and 12 minutes of sleep.
It may just be the angle, but I love that it looks like he is flipping off his brain.  I would love to give the bird to my brain most mornings...
"yeah we're not doing that" sums up my entire relationship with my brain
“Now we need to go to that job”         “We’re not doing that.” “I know”  I’m floored. 😂😂
Absolute god tier
1:15 is my brain EVERY NIGHT, except I imagine about 15 embarrassing moments every time I wake up. If I don’t do that, I imagine a spider/scorpion/snake hiding in my bed preparing to kill me. I don’t like going to bed.
Same
that actually scared me
One in 10 of us hit the like button and only 197 hated this video. That's one of the best ratios I've seen!
My kept me up for two hours last night telling me that my life is a joke, I've accomplished nothing, and I should just leave everyone I've ever met behind and be homeless so I don't burden anyone anymore...  Can I get a new brain? I think mine is broken...
Hi Great video love your content
Exploding head syndrome, like audio hallucinations. It doesn’t matter how hungry you are, or how badly you have to go to the bathroom, if you hear someone banging on the other side of your bedroom door while you know everyone is the house is actually asleep; you are staying in your bedroom!
2AM Brain: Hey….Hey! Me: What? Brain: Wanna go on a adventure involving killer robots, aliens and a corrupted empire? Me: Oh nice, I’m going to remember this when I wake up right? Brain:…. Me: I am going to remember this…right?
Me right now….
Hey remember your high school crush? Wonder what she's up to. Remember how she was single like, all of senior year and you never had the courage to say anything to her, and then you never saw her again? Remember that?
my brain in a nutshell
Why does the brain look like Mad Sweeney.
3:03 AM lol
Me rn
My brain at 3: AM: hey dude just wanted to remind you have lonely you are and how your never gonna have friends or a girlfriend…your also gonna fail highschool 😐
When I was around 14 I spoke up in class that bulls actually don't hate the colour red, that's a myth, but one girl said it wasn't so I gave in quickly. It's been nearly 10 years and I'm still a little annoyed I wasn't more confident
Is that like sleep paralysis?
So true
I love this guy
This is relatable my brain does this too
My brain is like this 24/7. No idea what to do about it.
The tired brain: Dangerous because stupid; safe because lazy
I laughed so hard to this, then cried because it's true
*in retrospect there was a really low risk of that being a killer anyways* this will age very well
I am actually relieved to know that I am not the only one to have weird brain conversations when I am trying to fall asleep…
this happened to me today
I feel like Ryan and George hacked my brain
My brain at 3am: "You know that sleeping thing we do? Yeah, we're not doing that tonight. Have fun at work."
Why DOES my brain remind me of embarassing memories?
That gosh darn Witching Hour.
God this video is fantastic
My brain is the opposite. There actually WAS someone in the house, and my brain goes "oh its the mailman, back to sleep".
This is literally every single night of my life.
I sleep at 3 to checkmate my brain who gives up and passes out
This is exactly my brain!! 😀 Fighting with the brain so not tight!
Bahahahahahahahaha that was awesome
So funny
My brain is always a jerk… #Anxiety
I live with an actual voice in my head and honestly this is weirdly accurate
Adult channels for youtubers be like:
This is so relatable!
This definetely should be a series of mini videos. Really funny!!
🧠: Hey what time is it? How long till alarm goes off....should check that plugged in phone Door locked Is it going to rain? "Oh, how he loves he so madly...💃 Me: shut up brain or I'll stab you with a QTIP!
Omg so truth
"Are we dying right now?" Wait waking up with this anxiety sometimes isn't my own unique insanity?
this is spot on
0:34 is either a person or the singer of static-x
I'm the opposite:  I just know that I'm going to die someday because I will under-react to a real threat.
wow, so some ppl can actually sleep a couple hours before this kinda shit happends?
Watching this video at 3 am was fun
Being scared by your brain at 3am is tight!
I’m laying in bed naked with a empty bottle of cognac and a pocket “ya know what” with a 45. under my pillow ready for cowabunga …. Wrong house
Me watching this at 330 am while unable to sleep....
Called. Out.
this is so me, in the moment like this i wish i have aphantasia where i can just closed my eyes and there is nothing but blackness, my mind is so goddamn wild sometimes, i even have 5 personality that i pretty much talk too all the time, complete with their full detail visual , voice and accent
I started watching this at 3pm, destinyyyyy!!!!
Thats me 24/7, lifes fun :D
There needs to be a section that's just hours and hours of the brain saying "We have to get to sleep soon, it's very important, we have that meeting, if we don't get to sleep soon we won't get enough sleep, we might even sleep through the alarm, so go to sleep, go to sleep now, we need the sleep, sleep is important, sleep sleep sleep, it's already 3 in the morning and we haven't slept, if we fall asleep right this second we'll still get 4 hours of sleep, it's not enough sleep but it's better than no sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep" and so on
This is content YouTube was made for. Our Lord and saviour Ryan George. Deliver us from TikTok and lead us not to Instagram.
Brain: “Uh oh! Your closet is open!” Me: “Yeah, so?” Brain: “I don’t want to speculate, but there’s definitely a monster in there. Watching us.” Me: “Ok, so are we going to get up and close it?” Brain: “Nope, too tired.”
Watching this at 3am rn for this exact reason
I used to live by a cemetery. Like 30 feet from the cemetery. The sounds at night there were not normal.
lol
"oh that's just a jacket" *Turns light back off* "OH MY GOD IS THAT A PERSON OUT HERE TO KILL ME??"
The being naked in public dreams happen during these nights. Just sayin'.
This feels so INFP
lol, so true
Sir, sir, I don't mean to be rude, but I don't think that brains are jerks at 3. A.M. I think that they are always jerks.
This is just about as relatable as it gets😂
Here’s the thing I just stay up till 3:30 so I can skip this  (Light on holding a weapon so if my brain dies this I feel safer)
I have insomnia, so.... Imagine getting an accumulative 3 hours of sleep, tops, in a 10 hour span of trying to go to sleep. Every night. For 30 years. I swear there's times I just lay there with my eyes closed for 8 hours and just convince myself at some point I fell asleep.
Lol this is me 🤣🤣🤣
This is like the most relatable sketch I've ever watched
Amaze balls of genius 💓
This is why I sleep with the lights on tbh, and force the little voice in my head to shut up with meditative excercise. If it's never been right before, it's not gonna be right this time.
too easy
0:49 The best intentional voice crack I've heard in my entire life.
Wow, I watched this when it first came out, it feels like not long ago but apparently it was 2 months ago, I dont even know how
well this is the opposite for me , the brain is a jerk when i about to sleep , and when i wake up at 3:00 am the brain does not even work.
Just make sure yea know what you are looking at before unload on it.
Ha. Three AM. Pathetic, *proceeds to record not being able to fall asleep for 2 hours since I laid down on my bed, not ever checking social media, while thinking about death, existentialism, and thinking my brother stole the potato chips again.*
The football thing actually happened huh 😂
I have to agree brains are jerks at 3
Its a jacket its a coat Yeaa. Its a coat its a jacket.
Anyone else watching this and just questioning their existence while feeling trapped in eternity?
Weird that I don't have such a problem when woke up 3 a.m... What's wrong with my brain?!
What is this fuckery?!?! This happened to me last night and all of a sudden is in my recommendations?
Should have put hashtag realateable missed opertunity
didnt know the brain exited the head tp talk to you
Brain: humans are jerks at 3 am When i try to tell him embarrassing stories and try to make them assume theres a killer here they try to make me stop!
My brain at 3AM: Remember that time you called your 3rd grade teacher 'mom'?  Pepperidge Farms remembers.
why did they recommend this to me at 3 am tf
O 🇷🇴🇿🇲
This should be a series
I call this phenomenon " cat brain".
Watching it at 3 AM
my brain at 3am: oh, 3am already, I should go to bed ;P
Imagine not laughing at one of Ryan George's jokes
so accurate
Brain 12am: you know there are weird-shape sharp metal tools made sololy just to torture humans. Why? Me: hmm.. good question
"It's a Monster! " "It's a Thief!" "Its just a chair"
1:29 he did a peace sign to his brain XD
I’m terrified and also vieux dé’
My brain at 3 am usually asks questions like “do dogs think in the small amounts of words they know” and they are usually very good at keeping me up at night.
Its 6a.m I've been up for 3 hours! Yes I got woken up from a noise!
We need part two!
Do more of these please Ryan!
Too good 😂 According to Chinese medicine, the liver is most active at 3am, you know cleansing and the like. Drinking is often associated with waking up at 3am 🤔
the jog part is so accurate lmao
£_£
Brain at 3 A.M. - "Tomorrow is when you start your weight loss journey...did you make a workout playlist?" "Who let the dogs out and why?" "I want my baby back baby back baby back baby back ribs" "That new video game comes out next week!" "Did someone write to you in any of your social media?" "CHILI'S BABY BACK RIBS"
You know we die because of what Adam and Eve did
Weed Weed Weed and if that doesn't work more weed, your brain will thank you for it.
Comedy gold right here.......
I was awake at 3 a.m. and then took a shower at 7 a.m.   This made me laugh so hard I almost woke up my family by laughing. 😅
I’m inside your walls
Ohhh boy, when Brain conjured up that high school memory, I FELT that 😬😬😬
Yeah, make some more brain videos, they're so funny.
Me: turns of a light My brain: there is a demon behind you so run
OMG This is so accurate! 🤣
I’ve an interview tomorrow, and I absolutely can’t be late.. To be sure I got some sleep I went to bed at half-past eight.. But first I had a run and a long hot bath... I haven’t had a coffee for a week and half... So given that, please tell me what is it in heaven you want from me, insomnia, at three thirty-seven?  Insomnia, what is it you’re so certain that we ought to do? And why’s it so important that we do it now at quarter-to- five in the morning when the world’s asleep? What is the reward that you’re so sure we’ll reap By staring at the ceiling from now until morning And sitting our interview compulsively yawning?  Why sleep? when there’s so much exciting reciting of Little Bo Peep to be done Why sleep? when you could be excessively pressing your wobbly tooth with your tongue Why sleep? when you could be robotically totting up flocks of imaginary sheep Why sleep? when you could be repeatedly tweeting the fact that you’re still not asleep, not asleep!  Okay, it’s nearly seven This is absolutely gruesome now! You win! Let’s just get up and hope that we can push on through somehow  No, as it happens maybe you were right We ought to get some sleep now - THERE’S NO TIME! - good night  Well perhaps if I skip breakfast and I don’t have a shower I suppose I could just dose off for a quarter of an hour….  ..……*pips* Good afternoon this is the world at one with 45 minutes of news and comment  OH NOO!
MY BRAIN TOLD ME TO CALL MICKEY MOUSE AT 3AM!!!!!
Im so good that at three am my brain does not disturb me and sleeps
My brain when I was 6 years old...
Me: Can I go to sleep now My brain: let’s look at every embarrassing memory, conspiracy theory, ghost story, and traumatic experience that ever happened.
am here at 5am thinking about this:  is one more than one   please send help
How can you record this alone
"Why did you assume something was here to kill me" "Well its better to have the Adrenalin and not need it, then it is to need it and not have it"
I haven’t laughed so hard in a long time
I’m gonna need you to get all the way out of my head.
Me, a couple of minutes falling asleep: "yes, I have finally fell asleep soon enough - 8 hours of sleep, perfect!" my brain at 2 AM after 5 hours of sleep: "SSSHIIIIT FUUUUCKKKK gotta wake up early maaan, morning shift starts in 4 hours, that is why I have woke you up man so early, so that you are tired and although you woke up early you still come late maaaan, now thank me!"
No cap it’s 3:00 rn
More episodes of this please?! :)
"If you had caught the ball instead of face-planting into a pile of dog poop, we would have won the game and you'd probably be making 10× your current annual income".   Thanks, Brain. 😍
Wierd.. i been subscribed for a while but i think i haven't seen any of these for 2 months.
So my brain wants to watch porn at 3 AM but I'm not interested. So my brain decides to remind me of my first sexual experience just for laughs 🙃
I can relate to this lol
Because we are the brain, we are calling ourselves jerks
Seriously,  you are a genius, keep up the  great work
That football player and the class laughed bit was preeetty specificc-cious.
...what do you call it when your brain does this all the time?
My brain: ya know that demon chant you heard in a movie Me: yea why? My brain:I'm gonna sing it and it'll be reaaallll hard to stop me  Me: damn it
My brain tends to bring up every embarrassing/cringeworthy thing I have ever said at 3am.
Then he did a backflip snapped the brains neck and saved the day
This would be a great series!
*Me watching this literally at 1:30 a.m
I hate how I can relate to this
Dark Ryan is actually low key creepy, lol. Well done.
There's 1 dislike per 550 likes! that's really low! Probably the lowest I've seen and I always pay attention to that. In other words, 1 moron out of over 550 disliked this video.
I was literally thinking of jogging before I went to sleep last night lol
I absolutely can't realty to that! I'm a blessed sleeper. But it's funny! 🤣
my (our?) life
me from 1 am to 4 am hahahahaha
My brain during lockdown Spring 2020 😅
This is sooooooooooooooooo relatable Hahaha hahaha😆
Brain was creepy when the lighters were ON💀
Funny and so true. 😂
i didnt plan to but i watched this video at 3am
Uh oh 18 minutes until my brain begins it's transformation into a jerk
Technically your brain is speaking with your brain
Meanwhile on the important days: Brain: Hey look your alarm is ringing! Me: Cool! *turns off the alarm* Good night!
That intruder looked just like Ryan George!
I have a pitbull that is sweet, but protective when there is danger(Almost killed one of my pigs for charging me). I figured that if anyone is there to do me harm, he'll be halfway through their jugular before I wake up.
SAMMMMEE
I will never get bored of ryan george😂😂😂😂
I shame myself all the time over stupid things I did and said years ago. The people involved may not even remember the incidents, yet I still cringe every time.
This video is surprisingly accurate 👍
My brain at 3 A.M.: *contemplates the meaning of life and my purpose of being on earth*
0:38 I love how he sinks into to his pillow 😂
The end was the best
Eat your cereal
my brains like this 24/7
Watching this at 4 am B(
That highschool PTSD joke is so specific, I wonder if it really happenned to Ryan! 🤣
Thank you for this.😂😂😭 Not alone.💓🖤
I woke up randomly at 4am and this is too accurate :/
This is amazing....why doesn't it have at least a million views?
this is actually so accurate when i stay up till 3 am
Brain:go pee  Me: no I don’t feel like getting up  Brain: ok I’ll make you dream of a toilet to get you up  Me: man let me go ahead and get up
More like my brain at 2:17 am
Just yesterday I was paranoid and couldn't sleep because I was scared of having an aneurysm every damn second. Yeah I know, I need therapy...oh wait, I AM in therapy
Its strange the way the mind can wonder and also stop to gossip and chat with memories that you and me aren't really fond of (NF)
This happened yesterday night and mostly every night.😂😂😂
my brain at 3am: hey wake up there is a creepy guy under your bed me: no :brain yes me: okay ill check *pile of cloths under bed* me: oh crap
More like, Generalized Anxiety Disorder is a jerk at 3 AM, not as catchy though.
Literally my brain most of the time
why is this a thing?
OCD crank it up to a million
🧠🤓👻
2nd part ?
3am  Brain: I'm just wondering if we really finished high school / college / uni. Wasn't there one course you have to take to really finish it? Me (in half sleep mode): Oh shit, did I really forget. How will I have to handle it? Do I have to quit my job and re-enroll? Brain: I don't know. Me (now fully awake): Wait a minute, I have my degree. Brain: Okay, then we can go back to sleep. ...
Never have I related to a YouTube video more in my life. 😂
"Are we dying right now?" That is so accurate it's scary
Bro 🧠
How is this so real?
Im usually up by then... wide awake
Now add OCD into the mix, and your brain ends up making you get up and go check every closet in your house      Twice
I am facing this since last week.
Watching this at 3am because my brain believes I’m dying even though the chances are low.
Simple solution: Always sleep with a loaded gun under your pillow. If you wake up and see something threatening, fire two shots at it. If it's an intruder, the intruder will die. If it's just one or several objects, it's okay, because odds are there was a would-be intruder right outside your home, and you just scared him or her off. Follow these steps and you'll be back to sleep in no time!
“Success is liking yourself, liking what you do, and liking how you do it.” Sharing some love from a small YouTuber
Insomniac here. Literally watching this at 3 am lol
THE FIRST GUY TO EVER OPEN A DAYCARE PLZZ
Liked the video at 0:10 🤷🏾‍♂️
3 A.M. Brain: so I can’t get you to go back to a peaceful sleep but what I can do is provide you a bunch of random thoughts that are meant to create the illusion that you might be asleep but all the while you will be wondering to yourself if you’re actually asleep or not
I actually have the "you need to turn on the light to check if there's someone/something in the corner" thing happening waaaay too often
Literally watching at 3:39
You know who that was? It was me!!
Brain at 3am: We are suddenly falling!
Make this a series!!!
This was weirdly validating 😂
You win YouTube today. What prize would you like to select?
Hi there, hello, is this where we we can submit ideas for future videos? I would like to see you do a video about The First Guy to Ever get Pulled Over for Speeding. I think it would be funny. So you should go do that then. I hope it will be super easy, barely an incovenience.
And all this time I thought it was just me and my effed up brain.
WHY IS THIS SO ACCURATE!
A beautiful and worth watching channel. Subbed! A fellow creator.
Me at 01:30
Me, every morning: 01:32
Jules from WhatCulture Gaming & Ryan George are the best 2 folks on the internet period. Truly the best of us.
Accurate.
Me: "I guess we should go for that jog." Brain: "Yeah, we're not doin that." Me: "...I know."
well, it does make sense for our survival brains for be on lookout for predators, tho we dont really need that function that much anymore.
Me: it’s late, I better go to sleep Brain: HOLD UP! I haven’t got a really annoying song stuck in your head, ANDDD I need to remind you of tones of stuff you have to do but also remind you that you can’t do them now. How about that? Me: oh god I forgot to buy milk for tomorrow, and now dancing queen is stuck in my head!
The first person to have a kidney stone.
Me: okay time to sleep  Brain: yeah, so I decided this is the perfect time for us to reminisce about your life, especially about those parts where i was totally at fault but made you think it was someone else's ….we can start with how you decided to abandon school and go into rap music.
my brain at 3am theres a cat eating pizza   me: visible confusion
Saw and watched at 3am. Lol 😂
Ryan! Your brain in the shadows look exactly like Mad Sweeney from American Gods!!! Is that why you can be in multiple places at the same time? Because you are a god and not just a measly clone?
sooooooo fucking true, hahaha glad i'm not the only one
"Brains are jerks at 3 am"  Me watching this at 2:12 am and couldn't sleep    My brain : "why you post this comment? We still have like 43 minutes to start overthinking your life, cmon get some rest"
Great idea for a series. Hint hint.
Imagine if u could actually communicate with your brain like this
*Me who never remembers dreams, just gets the side effects* : why did I wake up with a pounding heart and sweating? Brain: Unclear Me: Did I have a nightmare? Brain: I don't know Me: Why do I feel anxious? Brain: Because Brain: Also you just realised you didn't say "hi" back to that person and now they hate you, I've decided.
I just wanna say thanks for making me laugh!! EACH of your videos amuse me 😂😂 i always type your name in my youtube search box whenever i have a bad day and your videos are just so funny that i even forget my problems 😂😂
That exactly my brain
Dying! Omg, I'm DYING LAUGHING!! This is so perfect!
I thought it was just my brain that did this kind of stuff lol.
Lowkey he lost his keys
Ryan, I gotta know. Was the 2x joke telling story a real story?
This is my life
The best 3AM video!
this videos is just plain awesome.. the adrenalin part kill me.. George i know you cover a wide range of things.. but this one deserves a sequel..
"I see dead people." "Oh, no, it was just a coat." "You mean Jacket." "I said what I meant to say." "Ok, I can do this all night you know." "Fine, it was a jacket." "Actually I think you were probably right, yep, it's a coat." "Oh, my God."
1:10 was excruciatingly relatable.
Life is just a slow death
This is my brain at all hours
Relatable!
Dude you are so creative Jesus..  where do you come up with these stuff? 😂🤣

I used to be such a night owl and have a lot of difficulty going to sleep around 3:00 a.m. especially when I used to work jobs that made me work until 3:00 a.m. actually, but nowadays I actually tend to go to sleep around midnight or 1:00 a.m. now. I actually wake up in the morning between 7:00 a.m. or 9:00 a.m. now and I'm pretty pleased about that actually. I have felt like I've been able to do more during the day because of that. But there's nothing wrong with night owls or people who actually do stay up late because while we are asleep many of them are actually out working.
Every time you insult your brain that’s just your brain insulting itself
1:22 Ryan’s face in this scene is a mood
LOL i thought this was just me
They're Pinky; they're Pinky and the Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain!  NARF!
My brain at 3 AM: Hey, wake up! You gotta pee right now or your bladder will explode.
What, no Adstronaught?
Seriously.
this is why i drink before sleep. i just wanna sleep ya know.
This doesn't work on me anymore
You should make a video “the guy who invented money”
This has probably become my favorite youtube channel. From Ryans sense of humor to the way he crafts his videos is perfection. There's not a bad video on this channel.
You should do the hitmans bodyguard for a movie pitch meeting
I think you should release a Loki Pitch Meeting on Screen Rant
This is my brain all the time
To true
But why, brain?
2021: 2015
Brain: "Holy crap we're exhausted! You really should have laid down sooner!" Me: "Yeah...I know." Brain: "..." Me: "..." Brain: "...I'M A BARBIE GIRL IN A BARBIE WOOOOORLLLD..." Me: "F*CK OFF BRAIN!!!"
I like how his brain actually looks exactly like him
You should do first one to make math
The accuracy...
Title: Brain are jerks at 3am.  My Brain: Brian jerks at 3am
You are my favorite YouTube personality. Not even close
in the ryanverse all women are julie nolke and all theorists are matpat, all pets are cats and all the other guys are ryan and the old people are bernie
I read “brain” as “brian”
have you ever noticed in this universe the bigger the stach the more important you are
Who tf sleeps with their door open
I just realized ,afyer a year of you making me laugh. I never subbed...New Subs..old Fan !!
You know… and here I thought i was “special”, turns out I was just another Ryan clone…
I'm glad this man exist
POV: You saw this in recommendation or you just searched It and  you are watching it at 3am
Yea my brain jerks at 3AM aswell.
Do first person to sell something used
Me trying to sleep: 🥱 My Brian: hi hello it’s me your Brian Me: 🙁 I thought we were supposed to be sleeping  My Brian: ye well I just thought we could you know talk about things that will happen in the future Me: no I just want to sleep My brain: well you know people are gonna die and you’ll be alive when it happens  Me: omg your right ☹️ My Brian: ye so let me tell you every other thing that you probably don’t want in your head Me: noooo!😩
So many times I said a joke, then said it again....so many times. 😓
At 3am  Brain: Hey man! Remember that time you told her you liked her and she got awkward and left? Hey remember how you missed that goal that cost you the game in high school? Remember..  Me: Ahh shut up I’m trying to sleep!!   At 9am  Me: Hey man! We gotta wake up there’s a super important work meeting right now and my boss is pissed!  Brain: Ahh shut up I’m trying to sleep!!
Me: Trying to sleep Brain: Here's every cringy memory I have in the archives, enjoy remembering that time you airballed a shot you make every time in front of your high school crush
Everything in this channel is so relateable
your videos are funny I decided
Super easy
do anxiety next
Here because it seems screen rant is dying and I want more you
"Brains are jerks" should be a series !
Hahahahaha  I look forward to this being a formal series.
Im getting the Gus johnson vibe
My brain when my parents aren't home: Why is the sky blue? where is the eifeel tower? what is trigonometry my brain when they are there: I hope they cant read my mind.. lemme not think of anything....i hope they dont find out i burned down that orphanage
Why in the world did I watch this right before I'm about to go to sleep? Now I'm thinking about stuff and planning things for the next 4 days.
Me, at 3 AM watching this:
omg this is so true
I keep coming back to hear "...yeah that's probably a good...oh my god! Is that preson?!?" 🤣
Ryan George, you should do a video on the animated movie •Home• about aliens with Jim Parsons from Big Bang Theory.
Please make this a mini series
More of these please
Would like to see a pitch meeting for Microsoft windows version names
Seems the only way to protect yourself against your mind…is to…parachute it! <<<
Two words to describe this man: Comedic Genius
*My brain at 3am:* Remember that girl you saw earlier that you didn’t talk to because I couldn’t think of a clever line?  *Me:* Yesss? 🙄  *My Brain:* i JUST thought of something! 🤗  *Me:* 🤦‍♂️
5days
I can totally relate to this
Do y'all know this moment, when you reach for something, but then change your mind, but then change it again, because other thoughts come to your mind, yet your brain figures out something, thats more important right now and in the process of obedience your arm just goes back and forth really akwardly?
your a funny
Make this a series! Like brains are jerks during a date or something more clever idk
You should do "the 100 pitch meeting"
Me at 3am: Just one more Pitch Meeting, I swear I'll sleep after this one 🤦🏾‍♂️
I learnt a lesson here today, not to watch this in the middle of the night
Brain: "Remember that musician you really liked but never saw? Well, he DIED. Had you partied more and studied less at college, you wouldn't have missed his show."  Me: "Yeah, but I saw lots of other good bands." Brain: "That's true. If you'd studied more and partied less at college, you wouldn't be such an utter failure." Me: "Yeah, that's true too....will you leave me alone?" Brain: "Uh.....no."
1:22 i just did that to a kid the other day
i fucking love this guy
Going on jogs is tight! But then again, NOT going on jobs is super easy, barely an inconvenience!
Great video. JIC this can help anybody else.  If you are having anxiety at night...I realized or me, it was a sign I was having too much coffee throughout the day.
Hey man! You should do pitch meetings for the main plot of video games. Just a thought. I think it would be tight
Funny, it's 3AM now and my brain wouldn't let me sleep so I started watching Ryan George and low and behold, this video magically appeared.
I like 7AM brain
Does anyone else feel like the story about him telling a joke twice actually Happened to Ryan in high school cause I feel that Definitely happened to Ryan in high school
The Brain Cinematic Universe CONFIRMED !!!!!
This has got to be a video version of that meme template
You don't know how many times I've had this conversation with my brain...
It feels like this video is to kill me);
brains are TIGHT
It’s 3 am. We’re all gonna die everyone. Night night.
Oh good! I'm NOT the only guy in his 30's still haunted by his high school mistakes.....
Wrong no one's dying but nice try BUT WRONGWRONGDIEDIEGG YGGGGHHKJJ
Bruh T_T LMAOOOO
"How do we breathe?" . Oh no. I don't remember.  .  Should we sleep even though I've forgotten how to breathe? . "Yeah, just sleep. " But wont the task of sleep, considering my brain has forgotten the mechanism keeping my body alive; be really rough to achieve?  "actually, no. It'll be super easy"   ______ __ ________

Five Nights at Brain - coming to you at a very inconvenient time!
"Yeah we're not doing that" was epic
funny
Make video about person trying to sell first microwave. I think this will be funny because microwaves be wonky.
I do think that phyiscal objects make me think there are people in my house
So accurate
Yha that is my brain alright
0:29-1:27     Is so relatable to me lmao
Just so good
i want more, and i know i shouldn't
3 A.M is the witching hour, be careful Ryan! Lol
I think about this all the damn time, man!
I'm watching this at 3am
😂😂😂
Say the joke a third time, they'll laugh for sure
Omfg!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I just experienced this last night. Brain, are you on my side or not?!
Me 6 years ago during nightmares: *intense fear* me now: *cracks knuckles facing nightmare*
cry dying. <3
this is literally what messes up my sleep at night, the whole "everyone i know is gonna die" thing
mine is:  HEY, WHY DONT YOU GET UP, WATCH YOUTUBE AND PLAY GTA?
0:55 Next to Ryan on the left! Ghost Orb!
the jogging thing is so #relatablehehebdsk 💦
Really? My brain is in programmer mode at 3AM
Way too accurate 🤣🤣🤣
Markiplier Vibes
Having anxiety is that feeling but like, it doesn't just stick to the middle of the night lmao
first person to insult someone next? please?
I feel all of that but you forgot the part about contemplating life and it’s meaning
I would like to file a complaint. My biography was published and I don't like it.
first person to think of idioms?
Wow, Brain is kind of an asshole, isn't it.
Me trying to sleep My brain - that girl was cute, she texted you first, is she into you. You could have made that line funny.. why didn't you say that. What anime should I watch next.
Weird 666k views…
There is 666k views for me right now
Why does everyone keep using this trope of an old joke no one laughed at? It's the mildest thing you could remember when you have insomnia.
I love how brains are roasting themselves in this comment section.
They truly are !!!!
It's definitely another Ryan.
I imagine this is my brain during sleep paralysis, the shot of adrenaline is spot on 👏👏
Oh thank God, I thought it was just me...
If Ryan Reynolds and Markiplier had a baby...
please do the first guy who had an evil monologe
The ending is too relatable
SUPERB!!
I'm literally watching this at 3am... Thanks for making me stay up longer and think these things.
Watching this at 3 AM
First person to ever see a shooting star?
0:35.  I love his expressions! I could watch Ryan all day!
Brain: Hey, isn't it weird how much you notice your breathing when you're trying to get to sleep?  Me: Stop it.  Brain: And how 'bout that? You can even feel your heartbeat, too.  Me: Stop it, damnit!!  Brain: Wow, all this breathing and heartbeating and whatnot. You sure are inching closer to death with all that. I wonder how long you'll make it. I wonder how much you'll suffer between now and then.  Me: *not sleeping*
I’m watching it at 2:58 A.M
Currently 3am right now
when you find this video at 3 am.
Me watching this at 3 am like😳
You know its his brain cus his shirt says so
Anyone else saw the tattoo?
*Y O U  H A V E  N O  I D E A  H O W  T R U E  T H I S  I S*
Holy crap there's an orb next to his right shoulder!! 0:55
Do the first person to drive a bus
I've watched this like 10 times already and still funny and true as fuck
First guy to suggest eating animals and/or plants
Call me a conspiracy theorist, but I believe the brain and the cat are working together in a master plan made by their overlords, the social media apps.
What the LANGUAGE
These twins look so similar
I know we can make fun of this all we want but deep down... we can all relate
Very inaccurate, your brain would be already talking to you about all the bad things as you're trying to sleep.
_"It's a coat, it's a jacket."_ _"It's a jacket, it's a coat."_ What a brilliant dialogue
Get out of my head, Ryan.
i envy his eye color
did my brain eat edibles? cuz thats my exact train of thought after eating edibles.
Alright, now im a little scared. Is Ryan George just a figment of my imagination? Because he is strait up in my head!!
You should do first person to rent a building
Sign petition for part 2
Ahhhh ha ha ha...Perfect. Sharing this piece of perfectiong.
Yeah, we're not doing that! LMFAOOOOO #EverydayB
This one practically wrote itself, didn't it
The first guy to see rain
Funniest horror story ever.
The first guy to write a book
This guy deserves  10m plus subs...... People don't know what they are missing
Imagine the first guy ever to click a picture
This happen to me every day
Brains are tight 🙃
"Here, have this dream about not having your homework done even though you haven't been in school for over a decade."
I want more of those Magic is outdated vids
This basically a normal person brains vs my brain
Hahaha I love how brain is using a brain t-shirt
Please Ryan make this but like a movie or a mini series. This was fucking hilarious and interesting at the same time.
What was that joke is my question
So Ryan, are you a Habs fan and will you be watching the game tonight?
You should do "the first guy to ever wear a tie" "Dude why are you walking around with a cloth tied to your collar?" "Because it looks formal i decided" 😂😋
It's weird how the brain can complain about itself talking to itself trying to sleep.
Brilliant!  Ryan looks like fellow YouTuber Spenser Samurai!  -I’ll sponsor a few hundred $$$ for a cross/over sequence with Spenser & Ryan!  (Cuz that’s how YouTube works, right?)
this invoked waaay too many bad memories 🤣
Jerk brain: Do you *remember that?*  LOL The pause! :D
As someone with critical, harsh  insomnia this is accurate
Great skits
Idk if im dreaming or not but there is not a sponsor on this video
Goodnight brain!!!
that brain sounds like my brain
great good to know that other brains are also jerks not just mine
Why did I read Bryans are jerks at 3 am...
“You know what we haven’t thought about In awhile? DEMONS.”
Top tier video
Best one for a long time. It's 3am btw and a guitar just pretended to be an assassin.. still up for that jog though.
Watching this at 4 am, can you make a video for my situation?
I like you
I mean technically you are always dying, it's just that your body keeps making new cells to replace the dead ones
Here I am at 4 am and my brain isn’t letting me sleep so I’m watching this 😅
Everyone at 3AM: So you got something for me?  Brain: Yes sir I do! Everyone: So staying up until sunlight gonna be hard?  Brain: Noo! it's gonna be super easy barely an inconvenience
Idk what id do on YouTube most nights without your channel. Even if they are short, this is still one of my top three favorite channels to watch. Also, this is fucking, hilarious. Reminds me of your "morning routine" video in a way.
It is currently 3:42 am for me
The same thing with the clothers happened to me once. I almost got a heart attack.
My brain at 3 AM: Is the thought of eternity better or worse than the thought of no eternity? Me: I don't know, can we sleep? My brain: Do we really just disappear? Are we spirit or are we flesh? Me: Philosophers and religious leaders have been debating this very question for thousands of years, I don't think we are-- My brain: We are going to *figure this out*   ...sigh
Last night at 3am I wondered if we were already dead, you know how teleportation is breaking down your body and rebuilding it somewhere else, but the new body isn’t you, it’s a copy of you.  So I thought about how cells die and because none of the cells I was born with are still alive it means I’m dead.  I soon realised the flaws in this logic but for a brief few seconds I was having an existential crisis.
YES I remember farting loud in sixth grade—and so does everyone else who heard it in a tri-county area.
Wow! 0:56 something crawling on the wall😱 And my brain acknowledge that😳😳😳
👍👍👍 This should be a series
This has been my life lately.
I smell a new series coming ahead
This all stemmed from the day Ryan woke up in the middle of the night and his brain convinced him there was a real Ryanverse
Do “the first time to get hiccups”
Why is everything about this 110% true?!?!?!
My brain at 3 am : Hey Me: ohh hey what's up Brain: ohh ur up?  Me: been up for a long time Brain: u know everyone u know is going to die Me: yeah..... .. Brain: maybe u are dying right now Me: yeah I am...... .. Brain: depression?? Me: depression.... *nods*
Falling asleep at 3am is not easy really an inconvenience
That brain. I think I know him. Oh wait. He is everyone's brain!
Pretty much a typical brain
Do - “The first guy to try to market/sell sour cream”.  “It’s cream” “But, it’s *soured cream”. “Yeah. I know! You’re going to love it!”
Hey, remember that time in high school when you said a joke and nobody laughed so you said it louder 'cause you thought they hadn't heard you. Then a football player was like, "Why'd you say that twice? It wasn't funny." And then everyone laughed. You remember that?
Our family LOVES your videos, ones like these and of course Pitch Meeting. You have to find a way to do a Pitch Meeting for "Mac and Me"...maybe a whole series of famously terrible movies.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
R E L A T I B L E
Someone with ADHD should make a video like this 👍
Lucky you, your brain communicate with you.
Why in the hell is this so flipping accurate XD
I can relate with this, my brain and me sometimes have a conversation at night about crap like this.
The funny thing is this exact thing happened to me last night (from the day I’m writing this) at a few hours after the video was made, weird
THE ACCURACY!!!
Ironically there is what looks like an orb over his right shoulder at 1:01
this video has actually helped with my midnight mortality thoughts
8 pm:  Brain: We're not gonna fall asleep just because we're laying comfortably in bed under the blank-zZZZZZ.  1:30 am:   Brain: Get up Me: Why? Brain: You fell asleep under th cozy blanket and now you have to pee-DESPERATELY!  (Bathroom and back to bed.) Me: Ah, maybe I'll get back to sleep. Brain: Here's that stupid thing you said last week, that stupid thing you did ten years ago, and a list of things you have to do tomorrow, including making phone calls, that thing you hate  doing. Me: Well, I'm not sleeping. Let's go on the computer until 5 am and have chronic insomnia for two weeks because we got under the cozy blanket, shall we? Brain: Sounds like a plan!  Great sketch. So relatable! :)
It is 3 am and i dont like i havent even thought about sleeping
Well, well look who's inside again
Not me watching this at exactly 3am💀
0:33Yo, Literally my brain when I see something when the lights are off and I'm about to go to sleep xD
Could you do “first villain to ever monologue”  Generic Bond villain starts rambling on, the secret agent just doesn’t care, responds just kill me, then the villain continues and includes key details to the plot, like the code he needs to stop a bomb. Agent asks why are you sharing this, villain response is something like “it doesn’t matter you will blow up with the bomb, when it goes off in one hour”
The first person to ever get scared.
Especially when u have ocd
🤣 that was one of the better ones lmao
*In retrospect there was a really low risk of that being a killer* That's true because one side of your brain is saying that's not possible but the other side is panicking.
My brain does this all the time
This is the most relatable YouTube video I’ve ever seen
My wife divorced me. I fucking hate this.
Then he did a back flip, snapped the coat racks neck and saved the night sleep
Must be fun to sleep in to 3AM.
I only harbor resentment for the funny things I said too quietly, only for some jackass to repeat it, louder, to all the laughs and undeniable, everlasting, cool guy life points. Fucking, Samuel.
His brain made him TIRED, really an inconvenience..
HI HELLO MAH GUY
You’re a genius fam
Are we dying right now?  I mean... Technically we're *all* dying when you think about it
That silhouette shot was so spot on it was actually kind of unsettling.
Brain is a good character.  Go on and explore our subconscious traumas.
Me right now
Remember that time in 6th grade when you said you'd climb Kilimanjaro and everyone laughed? Yes. Remember that time when you were 26 and actually climbed Kilimanjaro...
0:15 that thought came to my mind a bit too many times at 3am lmao
Omg. How are you so clear up there about everything.
The first guy to sell grass
Ryans making youtube great again
This is pretty Frickin neat MY guy
You should do the first guy to ever hate someone
😂😂😂😂Amazing and freaking accurate
Love this one. So dead on. Ha
PLEASE DO MORE BRAIN STUFF!!
That high school story his brain told seemed to have some truth to it lol
Brain remembers the coat rack after thinking it was a person.  Playing tricks is a jerk move.
0:56 Wow, I saw an orb anomaly just to the left of the version of you standing. Very cool.
This could be a movie or a mini series Horror-comedy
“I guess we’ll not go on the jog, yeah I know” so relatable 😂
Where's that adstronaut guy?
I thought I was alone
I love how this is shot like a short film
Omg this is my life
Should’ve gone for the “do penguins have knees?” Gag lol
Totally get it
can't relate to this, my brain gets extremely horny every night 3am. 😂😂
thats a nice brain, actually letting Ryan sleep for a bit!
No but seriously.. Why? Why does your brain do that?!!
This is me every night
Brains are jerks at almost times, look up Power of Habit and Learning to Learn by Barbera Okeley. Both are best sellers and their entire point is to get your brain to cooperate with what you are trying to do.
That's my blokes brain all over
Very relateable!!
How they gonna know? Do they know? They're never gonna know.
How did you get in my head?
The whole "Coat hangers look like people" thing is especially scary if you're an owl person, considering you're not usually wearing your owl cosplay at night.
Yeah were not doing that I know
My brain when im tired: “without barely civilization” “what”
Comedic
there is a reason for 3 am.  most creative people doe there stuff at this time but thats not the reason. just google it but 3 am will not do the trick. you gotta ask the right question
im just thinking about how embarrising that would ac be
This video is litterly fnaf in your brain
Me: "We should probably go for a jog." Body: "Don't feel like it" Brain: "Don't wanna." Me: "Well alright then."
Clinical anxiety is this, but in the middle of the day. With drugs, its not bad, because it just means you're more alert than other people. Off meds, it can be hell.
I went to bad at 1 30am and has of right now it's 5:00am
Wait it’s 3 am
Me watching this at 3am: 👁👄👁
LMAO a new favorite
I like how he didn't mention about the sudden urge to do horny stuff at 3 am
This was the most relatable one so far.
My brain for the last 13 days: "you should really do that homework you were supposed to finish 13 days ago" anyway I'll probably do it later, maybe wake up early and do it
Yeah Brian is kind of mean at 3am
I’d love this to be a recurring series. The brain giving unhelpful comments. Brilliant!
Joke's on you, it's 4:30 AM.
this is why i sleep with the lights on kids
Who wrote that? That 's so great, pacing, editing, played, told, inhabited. Waw!
Super relatable.  Totally an inconvenience.  💜 😅🤣😂
This video has the same vibe as ajr's 3oclock things, just on the other end of the wavelength.
The five horsemen of 3am brain: 1. Cringey memory from years ago 2. That time you did something horrible to someone 3. Cringey comment you made on a video 4. Weird conspiracy theories 5. *PANIK*
Unrelated but, idea: first person to make a pun
“I’m gonna give us a shot of adrenaline.” 🤣 that’s such a good visual of what happens when you see something like dart across the room like it’s fine 🙃
watching this at 3am
So True!
More of this please
These sketches and pitch meetings are my ideal comedy fix outstanding stuff, please don’t ever stop 😂🤣
me: ok gonna go to sleep now brain: hey search up the name of that song or movie we forgot me: no sleep brain: no name of thing im not gonna stop bugging till you search it up me: fine. then you can finally go to sleep.
Brain: hey you’re about to willingly go unconcious for a few hours. How weird is that? Brain: oh and let’s practice a few speeches we’ll give to some people If we ever meet them again Brain: that’s a really good joke you should write it down so you can use it If you ever become a comedian.
My brain nether does anything
Oh my gooooood....  He's in my head!!
The end of the vid was relatable. This was every after school day for me: Brain after school on Monday through Wednesday: Let’s goooo I don’t have much homework! I mean I do but all that is due on Thursday so I’ll be fine. I’ll probably finish before dinner then watch YouTube the rest of the night.  Brain at night: I should have been asleep an hour ago. Next time I won’t say “I’ll just watch one video before I start” cuz then I just watched YouTube all night and until 10:30 when I need to be in bed. I won’t do the same tomorrow. Let me continue scolding myself and thinking about the sleep I’m losing so I don’t fall asleep until another hour.  Brain on Thursday night: Watching YouTube until 10:00 wasnt worth it at all. I had so much homework that I needed to complete but I was too tired to finish it so I just did 3 quarters of it. The other stuff is late. I knew I should’ve done this earlier this week because I had 3 days to finish all of this. I really needed too study for this big test and I really need sleep to be prepared as well. But how about I don’t sleep and think about if we can get away with the late work. I mean 90% if the time my teachers won’t grade the work until like 5 days later and they won’t say it’s late if it’s turned in by the time grade it. But what if they grade it tomorrow? My dad would be so mad at me if I have a missing in the grade book. I’m sure I’ll be fine though. But what if I’m not? Maybe I should debate with myself about this so I don’t fall asleep until 1 am.  This went on for 36 weeks. Finally it’s summer :) my brain at night says “tomorrow, I’ll read like 2 pages if my book and take a 2 hour nap so it seems like I’ve read the book for 2 hours. Then I’ll do absolutely nothing the rest of the day.” My brain that night says, “good, another productive day.”
I got a full-body wetsuit and hung it on my hat/coatrack in my bedroom to avoid folding it. Hat's on top, full-body wetsuit hanging beneath. You can see where this is going... Oh, and it was at the end of my bed. Yeah, I made myself shit myself...
Yeah, we're not doin' that.
After the obvious ones, like brains are jerks when taking a test, you should do a brains are jerks when reading YouTube  comments. It would be great to your in character reaction to YouTube comments.
That's how every horror movie starts
The number of times my brain just came up with embarrassing moments in my life infuriates me to no end...
my brain when I finally turn on something to watch during the night I realize, “oh it’s 3 in the morning already”
Could you probably do “The first guy to be a music composer”—?
DONT WATCH THIS VIDEO ABOUT 3AM AT 3AM😱😱🤯🤯
This was perfect lmaoo
This is so reliable it hurts😂
Theory: the brain did all that just because it didn't want to go on a jog in the morning
Why did I think this would be related to Bo Burnham's Inside in a way
Me watching this at 5:28am:
You look like Mad Sweeney, like soooo much!!
Nah i just make up very great things in my head because i am a very creative person.
Sadly really relatable 😓
This reminds me a little too much of Daniel Thrasher. Funny vid though
Keep making shorter and shorter videos to achieve the same ad revenue per view. I don't use mobile ad blocker I just unsubscribe when people get a mouth full a Susan's special sauce. Not saying I don't like the old content I just don't like the dull edge you have now.
My Brain at 3AM: Remember every putt you missed on the golf course. Remember every drive you hit OB on the Golf Course. Remember every chunk you hit on the golf course. Remember every skulled shot you hit on the golf course. Remember every missed green you had on the golf course. Remember every bogey you had on the golf course.                             r/Golf
this is so spot-on it's crazy. bless you for this, i'm not alone after all.
Person wanting sleep: Why would you think of all these pointless things to keep me awake? Brain: Listen, I'm going to need you to get all the way off my back about keeping you up by thinking of pointless things.
That is the time when the jog is the most important.
This might be your best one yet!
That's my brain on every topic
make a series out of brain and heart
First person to eat a bannana yknow beachside of the weird skin
This guy personally keeps screen rant relevant
We humans are all the same aren't we? 😓
This was accurate.
🤣
Ya I now
You have a sense of humor equivalent to the funniest person ever - which is you. Anyway I just finished watching every single one of your videos and I want more Jackbox Games videos they are so good.
You should tell the teacher about Mr. brain
Don't forget about how you hear a sound at night: Self: Oh that's just the house Brain: No, I think it's an invader Self: No, it's the house --sound happens again-- Brain: Ok that's definitely a murderer Self: Ok that's right we're dead
Aaaaand this is why I take sleep medication. AD(H)D FTW 🤪
That ending was the most relatable thing in the world
This guy is sooo cute 😍
lol
I’m still haunted by this memory: I was at a dollar store and the cashier said, “Would you like a receipt?” I didn’t hear what she said, so I just kept staring at her, and she had to ask me again…
The worst thing is I watched this at 3am...
Omg... this is too real.
Not going for morning jogs is TIGHT
Yes it does
I liked you until I didn’t like you for this. Thank you for exemplifying my nocturnal anxieties. So the next video is when?
AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
Jesus man, this is terrifyingly on the nose... I've been up for hours rewriting the end of a book in my head - not MY book, mind you, just some random novel that didn't end the way I thought it should and revisiting humiliations that I'm positive no one but me even remember.
I love this!   "We are definitely daying right now! lmao
Wtf ? I am watching this exactly at 3 am , i am not kidding
Me: I should goto sleep now.. Brian: Hey look Ryan George uploaded a new video! Me: Cool! *Brians are jerks at 3am*  Glances at clock *3am* Me: Son of a…
Watching this at 03:00 AM be like...
Chow Mein and a new video by Ryan..perfection
0:58 there is a spider  Also I get very paranoid at 3 AM so I can relate
All I can say about this is... yep!  This is what happens when I try to get some sleep...
Glad to see I’m not the only one who feels this way…
My personal favorite is when my brain has an idea at 3am and thinks it is BRILLIANT and won't shut up about it, so finally I will succumb and write it down... Then the next day I will look at this note and it will be some idiotic thing like "rocks are like stones"  and I can only sit and wonder why for 3 hours that night, INSTEAD OF SLEEPING, I thought this was so mind blowing
I especially related to the "everyone is going to die" thing and the random scare.  Why?  Why do our brains want to hurt us?
Watching this just after 3AM. 😄
Brain: "Yes that's an intruder trying to kill you" *adrenaline* Also Brain: "You idiot, I can't believe you got so scared over some hangers"
brain at 3 am is what u need on the test
Is that a filter? Are his eyes really violet?
My brain is a jerk
It's 3:10 am and I thought it was max 1 am, Minecraft is a strong drug
I don't have this problem, I just get to tired to sleep
I find parts of this to be way too relatable.
True
0:29 Don't Hurt ME!
This is my first time partially seeing Ryan’s tattoo on the inside of his bicep. Now I must know what it is.
0:13 My brain be saying dat
He has his own channel AND NOBODY TOLD ME?!?!
I got up at 3am and ... yes
This is sadly true
Yes this is hilarious, but also that stinger that plays when the time pops up is basically exactly the opening of Gangsta's Paradise (same key and everything) so now I've had Coolio stuck in my head all day. So this video is a win twice over, is what I'm saying.
Perfect way to end the day :) also the bit with the dude kinda scared me so I might have a lil' trouble sleeping.. 😔
So true! 😂
Brains are jerks sometimes
Another one of those 3 AM challenges, I see
100% accurate.
So real
First guy to be a Conspiracy theorist Should be a fun video
Never before has a video reflected my life so accurately
brain: hey   we could give that guy some money
My brain does that also Brain: hey there is a murderer in the other room and he killed your dogs and he's smearing the blood on the walls and he hung their bodies in front of the doors.... Me: Yep that's bullshit I'm going back to bed now I've had many years of experience putting up with your crap goodnight. Brain: awe man you use to get so scared. Want to play a phone game or watch YouTube for a minute? Me: Sure why not
Sooo resonant.
RYAN  STOP READING MY MIND, RYYAAAN
WHY AM I WATCHING THIS AT 2AM RYAN!!??
Me, 0.2 seconds before I saw & then clicked on this video (while lying in bed, about to go to sleep): I'm gonna doo my laundry tomorrow before breakfast
My brain at 3 A.M. Hey, you know all the bad stuff that's going on that you have absolutely no power to do anything about? Let's think about that for a few hours.
Yup mine makes noises Example: footsteps Screams, coughing stuff like that
Brains are jerks...
First guy to milk a cow!!..  😂!! Let's go!
7am.. come on, man.. THIS IS SPARTA!!!!
This shit 2 real😂
Who jogs at 7 hrs I jog at 0545hrs
Brains are  jerks at 3am. What are you talking about? This is my brain default setting.
So true
Brain: A sniper could be aiming through your window right now Me: Yeah I could die at any second Brain: But it doesn't actually matter because statistically speaking, you don't exist Me: That is also true thank you brain very cool
Someone likes the Awkward Yeti.
Brain at 3AM: "Everybody you know just effing hates you." Me: "Everybody?!" Brain: "Literally everybody." Me: "That's.... statistically quite unlikely." Brain: *"DON'T QUESTION ME."*
Now do one about the arguments we win with ourselves in the shower 🚿 🤣
This opens up so many opportunities please do more of this brain premise!
this one is my favourite
My 3AM brain blast is more like "hey, did you ever notice how you're kind of a failure?" Or, "ever think about what would happen if everything went wrong and was terrible? Yeah, just go ahead and think about that for an hour or two."
I read the title and I already like it.  You’re pretty cool!
Another one
Have you been watching a movie, stand up went to your room just to forgot why you went in there? You brain is a jerk all day long not just 3 AM.
A couple years ago, I was... in third grade? I was invited to a friends house after they had moved. When we went to leave, she said “we should do that again soon” I agreed and I left. It’s been 4 years and I never went back, I have no contact with them and even almost forget their name.   Some days when I lie in bed, I think to myself how rude it must have seemed and how down the person must have felt.   So, Tatiana, if you’re reading this, I’m sorry... I feel really bad 😂
This was my life for many years.
Too real...sometimes my mind takes me back to the pettiest or most troubling memories in the middle of the night. Oh, brain.
That's my brain yesterday and tomorrow
So accurate
4 am Brain: "Maybe we could get back to sleep if you ate all of that leftover macaroni and cheese." Me: "I'm not hungry...and I'm trying to lose weight." Brain: "Yeah, I know.....mac-a-roni!....mac-a-roni....mmmm.." Me: "Ok. Let's eat. (15 minutes later) Me: "Satisfied?" Brain: "Yes." Stomach: "Ohhh...what did you do to me?"
This is why real meditation is a thing! Gotta domesticate that monkey mind or it will leap and grasp at anything. ..which reminds me of Monkey Magic! Do you remember that Monkey guy that flew around on a cloud and had a staff! No me neither.
This is just my brain 24-7, even when I'm asleep.
OMG! This is me! Thank you for all the laughter you bring to me and my family. LOVE YOUR WORK!
My brain at 3am don’t go back to sleep
I've always thought - if someone's sulky and snappy with you - then what is going on in their own brain - how horrible are they being to themselves?
Brain: You know those people that die in their sleep?  Me: Yes?  Brain: If they hadn't fallen asleep that night would they have lived?  Me:I'm afraid to ask but I guess I'm going to anyway, why are you asking me this?  Brain:What if that is what will happen to you this night when you fall asleep?  Me:I really don't think think this is an appropriate time to think about this...  Brain:You are still going to though  Me: I know...
Great vid! Really made me smile. If you're looking for feedback: this one's definitely your best since weeks
Hey, where is the Adstronaut? I hope he is ok...
And of course, brain has to pick 3:00AM - the witching hour - to start the nonsense. 😈
7:00 AM Body: OMG. I want to die. Nothing is getting me out of bed. Brain: Yeah.... I cant believe I kept us up all night trying to spell Minneapolis. Why do I even care? Doesnt matter, we're definitely not going anywhere. Penis: HEY GUYS! What ya do'n? I've been up since 6!
Yeah this one was good! 😂
THIS IS SO RELATABLE OMG
I’m here for the solidarity. You left out the sleep paralysis demons but otherwise, spot on
Omg iTs 3aM hUnTEd
Ryan upped the production on this one, and i love it.
Lol, relatable
Best content on YouTube
Sometimes I question the sapience and sentience of my own brain are separate from my own mind.
It just hit me while watching this that the whole waking up thinking a vague shape is something or someone trying to kill us is probably an evolutionary thing we don't need anymore, think back to tribal times when we had to wake the fuck up and run (or fight) if lets say a predator or enemy tribesman or whatever is there to actually kill us...
It's sad how on point this is.
oh my, after so many years we finally get to see ryan's bedroom :D
Facts!
;-;
Reptile brain strikes again.
Of course ghosts/home invading murderers are also Ryan.
This Killer-Jacket at 3am was barely an inconvenience.
Me everyday "Remember that jog?" "We are not doing that" "I know"
This was your most realistic skit yet
This is my brain at all hours
When I try to sleep, my brain is like: *this is the perfect time to find instant solutions to all the problems you have with you're projects* Me: NoT NOw!! TrYinG tO sLeEp!! Brain: *get up and DO AS I SAY*
Your brain has a brain??
I want more of this series this was great
I bet it was 3 AM and Ryan George woke up with the idea for this video in his head and he could not wait til the morning to make it so he made it that very night and was all tired in the morning.
HA HA, they really are
Just had this the other night almost exactly. Well more on the everyone you love is going to die, and it's nice to see we all can relate to these things
Brain: “hey I see you’re trying to sleep but instead we’re gonna think about how we can’t sleep instead and dwell on it for an hour until you reach an inevitable panic attack and end up just getting out of bed at five instead of eight like we planned”
I feel that high school memory thing so hard
Spot on
🤣🤣🤣 holy shit now do the brain in the shower!
too accurate
Myself makes the existential horror
This is why I keep spear by my bed. Aside from few accidents its working fine.
I've heard some very weird noises in my house at night. I trained myself to ignore it all.
I bet you thought of this video at 3am
to be fair brains are jerks at 3pm too
👍💚 Sorry To Bother Ya 💜🙏
When aliens get ahold of your content, they are finally gonna understand us.
I guess all the "fake" youtubers were just recording their minds.
I hate that guy...
So true
Brain at 3am: Who do you like more? Ryan or George?
Our brains are in the same jerkass groupchat.
For anyone who doesn't know, and coming from someone who used to struggle with insomnia, the tough trick is to completely shut off your brain and tell yourself you'll think about things tomorrow. It takes practice, since thoughts are changed just like a muscle needs exercise, but it truly is possible. When I got the hang of it, I felt extremely sleepy after turning my thoughts off and I fell asleep within 2 minutes since I was so tired. Also, if you don't actually exercise, your body won't really see the "need" to rest. Trying to sleep right after doing anything is quite difficult, so unwind first as well. And going to sleep at the same time every single day will tell your brain it's time to sleep, so you get really tired a couple of hours before your sleep time, but that is if you follow a sleep schedule.
My brain at 3am is like, hey man its time for sleep, and i'm like hey no wait we're still driving this fully loaded semi and we got work to do for a few more hours. Oh well that sounds important but I'm gonna make sure your eyes don't want to stay open any more and you're really gonna have to focus to not pass out.
Heyy, awesome stuff..😂😂  Jaby sent me here. ❤️
I had times I experienced this every night, but meditation was actually really helping me. First it got worse somehow, but with the time I learned to concentrated my attention more to my feelings and thoughts as a reaction to my own unfeeled feelings got less. Feelings just want to be feeled, but you can think about them too, but you should do it after you felt them. Otherwise it can become a circle of madness sometimes.  PS. Humans should learn this in scool, but we don't and it is one reason why people are so crazy in the modern world.
Do we have "first guy to own a cat"?
Jaby sent us here
So accurate 😂
LMFAO
OMG I could watch a whole hour of this!!
So now my brain will want to try and figure out that tattoo - at 3am
I think that's anxiety?
God loves you guys!
Oh god, I didn't see this when it was uploaded, and it's just past 3AM now...
Watching this at 2am. Man I just love my brain. 😅
But what about when it goes the other way? You ASSUME your brain is just being a dick, but it was right all along and the threat is real...  For two weeks I heard rustling noises in my room every night around 3 am. I am an Adult, so I told my brain to shut up because it was just a bag blowing in the fan breeze or something...  One night when my brain was trying to raise the alarm and being ignored, it said, Oh yeah? Why does it only blow it at 3 am when the fan is on all night? Finally, I got up to hunt down the noise and prove it wasn't a big deal. It was the biggest fucking cockroach I've ever seen, trying to escape a bag it had been trapped in at 3 am every night...or it was coming 'home' to the bag at 3 am every night...  I suppose the biggest dick move from our brains is that every once in a while, it's NOT a dick move. Just to keep you on your toes.
This is so relatable
Anytime this happens I’m just like. SHUT IT BRAIN!!!
Watching this at 3 am with my coat staring at me is TIGHT.
Lock your bedroom door at night.
This is so true especially when you have ocd!
Legit woke up at 3
Oh my days sorry but this is my girlfriend 100% 🤣🤣🤣
Wow wow wow
Hey Ryan, here some video idea: *"Cancel Culture"*
My brain at 3AM: Making you not sleep is super easy, barely an inconvenience!
0:46 is it a coat?? is it a jacket???
as somebody who has ptsd and depression I relate to this way too much
🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣holy shit man this is so true.
"yaah we're not doin that" lol
Get out of my head
I really like the line he said about the joke that wasn't funny repeated twice. I wish I could make that a regular thing that all of the Ryan George fans use in future comments. But, man it's gonna be really hard to get any of his fans to continually repeat anything he says that is significantly funny in future videos from now on.
My brain at 3AM:.......boobs
Now do "Cats Are Jerks at 3 AM"
God between the abandoned jog and the death anxiety I can confirm I did indeed just watch a video about myself.
Me *awake at midnight* My brain “Hey, heyyy, there’s someone outside the window” Also my brain “Nahhhhh you’re just a normal person and your dog is right there so you’re safe”😂
How was the first parade planned?
My brain and me decided Doritos and guac would be a great breakfast with a Powerade.
What are you supposed to do when you turn on the light and it actually is a killer?
I suffered from sleep depression almost my entire life so I can relate to this. The brain can be a real asshat sometimes.
Clicking on the video i read "Brians Are Jerks at 3AM" i wasnt sure what to expect.
Oh your brain has a human counterpart that looks like Ryan George in your bedroom that talks to you while you sleep too? Huh.
This could be a series with multiple episodes
Just wait until you get to your mid to late 50's.  Brain: Hey wake up. Me: What's up? Is it time to get up? Brain: No, just felt the need to stare at the ceiling.  Me: Well I'm not turning on the lights.  Brain: Hey we should go to the bathroom.  Me: But I don't have to go.  Brain: How about now? (Makes imperceptible water noises in head) Me: No, let me sleep. Oh, wait a minute I got to go now. Brain: Cool, and when we get back to bed maybe we can stare at the ceiling for an hour or two.
I always think about that one joke at 3am
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🔻
Brain: Heeeeyyy, I see you are finally asleep despite your husbands snoring. Let me give you a nice dream about him snoring even louder, make you wake up and leave you with so much rage that you will want to murder the love of your life.  Me:🤪🔪
Just 2 nights ago I suddenly woke up at 3 am super alert, sure that someone was willing to invade my house and murder me, for no reason at all
This is the perfect video to wake up to
See, no, you know what, I'm so triggered by this but it made me laugh so hard!!!
Starting, Ryan George and BRyan George
what is like to be dead? what is it like to be dead? what is it like to be dead? You're gonna die you're gonna die you can't escape it, it's going to happen, no matter what, every day brings you closer... >reaches for trazodone<
“First bee to ever sting someone” would be a good video
Comedic genius 🤣🤣🤣
1:28 Yep... that's me with most of my responsibilities.
3AM...jerks....every night 😔
That Ryan ever told a joke no one laughed at taxes my willing suspension of disbelief a bit too much.
welp..
I already want part 2 of this!
Brain goerge
Then later on in the day when you need to be awake the Brain decides to take a nap.
Well at least the Brain didn't remind him of that spicy Burrito he ate and how his body wants to get rid of it as quickly as possible.
This might be the most relatable one yet.
LOOOL
Brain: “ARE THERE SPIDERS ON THE WALLS?” Me: “What? No, probably not.” Brain: “BUT THERE MIGHT BE. LETS TURN ON THE LIGHT.” Me: “I’m not turning on the light, we’re supposed to be trying to sleep.” Brain: “THERE COULD BE SPIDERS CRAWLING AAAAALLL OVER THE WALLS.” Me: “Okay fine!” *turns on light* Me: “See, there are no spiders on the walls.” Brain: “OKAY YEAH YOU’RE RIGHT.” ... ... Brain: “ARE THERE SPIDERS ON THE WALLS??”
My favorite so far
The solution? Sell your brain!
So true 😂😂😂😂
Me: Ghosts are not real. There are no scientific evidence... My brain: That's right. By the way, check out that shape in the dark.
We never think that a demon is playing with our brain and ruin our life to make us sin and not believe in god and push you closer to satan
Living with anxiety:
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The way he says “Ohhh, no no no” after the adrenaline shot XD
Was that High School story true!? I have a feeling it was!
My brain: Singing the same part of a song I hardly know over and over Don’t put your feet over the bed, monsters Monsters don’t exists Serial killers  Good point Go to sleep! Don’t tell me what to do! (Roll over and accidentally brush my cats wet nose in the dark) Aaaarrrrgggghh 🙄 Still singing the damn song
This might be the funniest one you’ve done. So so funny. I watch your stuff everyday. Keep it up man.
Nailed it
Brain at 3 am: - Hey, remember that time at Starbucks 8 years ago? I just realized that that girl was flirting with you!
😂😂😂😂
it's only funny if you don't wake up with a crushing pain in your hips where someone was sitting on you and an injection site behind your ear.
The funny thing is, I woke up at 3:00 am this morning thinking about how there might be spiders in my bed
And then you turn the lights off and the coat is a man again 😅
My brain at 3 am: You remember when you were making out with your first girlfriend and you came right as she touched your leg. Me: Yea? Brain: It was me human I replayed all those sites to make you confident! Also my brain: You forgot to clear your browser history also Me: oh no I got to fix that
No adstronaut... :(
We need more of these videos.
Seriously these need to be longer RYAN!
This man is to accurate
Meanwhile me with OCD:
Me: trying to sleep *car passes by* My brain: you hear that? that was your hopes and dreams passing by.
This is possibly the best Ryan George kit I've seen..... ever
Pretty accurate, in my case my place was robbed and the front left part of my skull crushed at 3 am couple of years ago. So my brain does not allow me to sleep before 3 am, and every sound is devastating.
That was hilarious!
I literally woke up at 3:00 am this morning to a cat licking next to me, and I thought it was a serial killer licking my ear. I just woke up (it's 7:13, and I normally go running around 6:30), and I'm like, nah, not happening. Once again, Ryan is too relatable for comfort.
100%

I should be sleeping, but instead I'm watching this beautiful masterpiece.  I should be sleeping though.
It’s exactly 3:00 am where I live
This was me this morning and I have a very big important day.
Spot on, Ryan!  Many nights I can't shut my brain off.  Surprised you didn't hit on the "repeating song" phase.
If you see a figure in your bedroom in the dark, don't turn on the light. He's is probably there to rob you. Pretend to be asleep until he leaves the room, then try to get the drop on him or call the police when he leaves
brain: i'm going to give u a trauma i decided
You should probably get off my back about that.
That one is a classic :)
But we go to sleep at 3 am.. alone..
0:49 killed me. 😂😂😂😂
Ryan George ft. Brain should collaborate with Lil Dicky ft. Brain
So i stumbled upon one of those pitch meetings in my recommendations a week ago. Since then i've probably watched every single one of them and now discovered your own channel. You sir, are a freaking genius! Love you, bye.
That jogging in the morning is so relatable. Like from last night I was so pumped, then the morning comes, I didn’t even want to get out of bed.
My brain gets mad that I didn't get any writing done so I end up staying up until 5 am writing with YouTube on in the background
Me: I'm exhausted I'm going to go to sleep My brain: ok let's see how we can make this more annoying for you... Me: please no My brain: remember that time in fifth grade- Me: what did I say, NO!! my brain: when you couldn't think of anything better to say- Me: no stop it not now... My brain: so you said to your friend "your Fitbit matches your shirt"  Me: yeah, I do remember, and I remember I felt really stupid after My brain: ooh! you were really cringy in fifth grade, lemme find another one! Me: * groans *
"It's a coat, it's a jacket" "It's a coat, it's a jacket" "It's a jacket, it's a coat"  -Ryan and his brain, ca. 2021
I'd love for this to be a series
OMG  this is so accurate!!!
Yes ryan , you're not wrong .. thankyou for having a brain too lol .
420 views, nice
You forgot to add all the arguments I’m not brave enough to have, scripted in ways that I win, but also that make the people i know look like Pure Evil
Video idea, maybe “first guy to ever be in love/has a girlfriend”?
My wife: “I think I heard something, can you check it out?”  Me: *painful sigh and tired response “ok” *walks back into bedroom  My wife: “was there anyone?”  Me: “no”  My wife: “are the doors and windows locked?”  Me: “yes”  My wife: “did you check?”  Me: “yes”  My wife: “can you check again?”  Me: *painful sigh   My wife: “while you’re down there can you soak the chickpeas?”  Me: *Cries from inside
It’s a jacket it’s a coat
Was it difficult to scare him?  Brain: no it was super easy, barely an inconvenience!
The brain would do anything to get out of exercise
This is so accurate.
My brain at 3am: Hey remember that time you saw a really funny upload on YT so you quoted it in the comment section but nobody gave you a thumbs up so you posted that comment again and got the reply "yeah, we got it the first time you posted that moron",  remember that?
When you trie to sleep   Brain: depression go brrr
I feel this every morning
Without my contacts and in the dark, the ceiling fan in the bedroom looks like the Darth Maul demon from The Conjuring. I shared that thought with my girlfriend. She wont let me go to sleep before her ever since.
I find that my brain is a jerk most of the time.
Me: *trying to sleep* My brain: "Hi there, hello!"
lmfao! I love the bit on remembering the thing from high school.
OMG That is my brain!!!
I should be sleeping but Brain said to check YouTube.
My brain at 3 am: dont look now but there’s someone staring at you and it might be here to kill you also im gonna play the song belle on repeat for 5 hours
can’t stop 😂😂😂 is a Jacket why did you assume something was there to kill me
Reminds me of that woman I recently online saw that explained how our brains have developed "too far" in the sense that we are standing in our own way. And that you don't see a cat needing a teacher cat to explain to it how to live. It just does whatever instinct tells it to do. And that we have evolved beyond our instincts and need to fight against ourselves. Makes kinda sense I guess!
"It's THE JACKEEEEET" - Richie Aprile
I hate when I'm dreaming, and I fall in that dream so I wake up thinking I'm falling and have a panic attack from it.. Good times
Alarm at 5:00 am Brain: five more minutes
My brain at 3 AM: "Gosh dang that killer over there isn't a killer, but if they were a killer which they probably are, and they covered my mouth and I couldn't fight back, I couldn't scream or make any noise to let anyone know I was being killed and then I would be kil and nobody would know until morning. Good thing it's probably not a killer *increase adrenaline*"
This was funny😂
Literally just realized that I clicked on this video at 3 am.
Finally Completed many of your old videos and now I am on track with new ones..😂
It’s 5am help
Too real T.T
fuck brains
This actually happened to me 😂
Is it sad that im watching this at 3am
💯 relatable
You know you are making great content when people are actually dissapointed there are no Ads at the end of the sketch XD
Brain at 3am. You should open or close the window. It’s too hot and or cold. Also remember the responsibilities and bills you have in your life. Don’t worry about going back to sleep 💤 it’s not like you could forget how to breathe or anything.
Hi
It's so weird to see Ryan George acting like a normal human being.
This man should be protected at all costs!!😂😂😂
Yep...this is the perfect video for me. Have only had 3 hours of sleep in the last two days.
Aw having feelings of dread at 3 AM is barely super, an easy inconvenience
Me: tries to sleep My brain: hey remember every one of your pets that has ever died?
You are really good at this, Ryan. Bravo. I hope you're enjoying making them and making lots of money from it.
Decided an appropriate time to watch this was at 3:08 AM
"Brains are jerks" should be a series.
Y is this accurate?!?!
It’s 2am and I stumbled upon  this video
When I was 14, a boy I liked corrected my spelling of the word "farther" because he thought I meant "father" and apparently didn't even know the word "farther". I went "Oh yeah", and changed the spelling rather than correct him back. Sixteen years later that still haunts me at 3am.
Video suggestions: The First Guy To Ever Prank Call
Its almost 3AM as I'm watching this...
Fucking brains!
At least Ryan's brain is processing something (although completely useless information).  Me, I wake up in the middle of the night, and I don't know why.  I try to go back to sleep, but I just can't fall unconscious.  So I'm complaining to myself how I'm gonna be tired in the afternoon.  And as expected, I'm tired as hell in the afternoon.
It is 4:40 am my brain woke up at 2.......i went to bed at 10
Relateble af
-Why did you assume something is trying to kill me? -I don’t know… -Fair enough!
The demon who's just your coat: https://youtu.be/9X5oEboYEKg
Brain told me to watch this
I need a sequel to this. Please.
My life, every time I try to sleep. Thanks anxious brain.
#SHIB #Shibcoin #GoodShib #SHIBARMY #ThePeoplesCoin
Watching this at 4:00am
My brain at 3am Hey remember your ex girlfriend that you broke up with because you thought she cheated on you. You should give her another chance.  Me maybe just to see how it goes. 6 months later My brain she's definitely cheating on you now and you should break up with her.
YOOO RYAN IS ON TRENDING
The 80 dislikes are from brain.
serious solution to night-time brain-harrassment: think of one of your hobbies, and re-enact some fantasy of it in your head.  in my case what works well is either dreaming up a football match or flying into the cosmos (like those spectacular zoom-in videos from the space agencies).  result: my brain is distracted by this, and eventually drifts off while in the middle of it.
It’s quite literately 3AM right now lol
I was expecting mr brain to just go "AAAAAQHAHHHHHHHH" and start being an upstairs neighbour but in your head
42 on trending
Holy shite, this is hilarious 🤣 (this should be a series Ryan!)
Ryan George - making all of us realise we’re exactly the same even though no-one wants to talk about this stuff. Communication should be super easy, barely an inconvenience…
Me: watching this video at 3am, like 👀
Sooo... who's watching at 3am?
And next day after lunch: Me: Ok I had a satisfying meal, let's now start working again. Brain: Zzzzzzz.....
Isn't that right 🧠?
The suggestion of going for a run in the morning is more scary than the coat!
Say whatchu want man I just want my brain to pump so much adrenaline that it will pump my heart so fast and clot my blood vessels and asphyxiate me to death cuz all the world cares about is how good you're at what they can exploit.
At 3 AM my brain wants a Krabby Patty.
Literally right now at 2:19 am
Watching this at 3:14am. This is accurate.
Bro I watched 30 seconds of this and I am in tears thank you!!!!
Ryans brain roasting itself is tight!
😄
I'm in this video and I don't like it.
keep making 'em bruh
lol watching this at 3am
Lol let me give us a shot of adrenaline so we can survive this encounter.   Oh no, no, no!
I’m literally watching this at 3:00 am
That 7 am joke is the most realistic thing you've ever done Ryan....and I should know, I am a real person that this happens to all the time.. >_>
I'm in this video and I don't like it :D
You seem to be awake but are also asleep.   Wierd.
Ah yes... again a video that is so true that it hurts. 👌
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
2:45am 🤣
Random memories from nowhere. You could be doing anything then out of nowhere your brain goes "Remember that time you got to sit in the beanbag on top of the shelves after listening to Mr Golding read a story about Mythical Greek Gods and you drew the best Zeus picture with the most correct objects and setting from the story?"  You spend the next 10 mins failing to draw a connection between what was going on around you that even remotely had something in common with that flashback. WTF BRAIN?
I though it was just me...
Eye waxer: right here?  Ryan: yes
A shot of adrenaline.
It is very fitting for me to be watching this at 3 AM
Bruh it’s about 3am rn and this is literally me
Without our internal Ryan George, we may have never survived long enough to develop intelligence. Thank you, universal-and-ancient-and-all-knowing Ryan George.
"Hey! Remember that time your broke your arm as a child?" "Yes, my single most uncomfortable memory." "Yeah, it literally snapped in half like a twig. I'm going to keep reminding you of that."
I love the metaphors he comes up with
This will help my teenager a lot. It will give him perspective.
Ack, also lol
Sometimes I'll wake up at 3am and think how can i go back to sleep😕
So true hahahahaha
Me trying to sleep. My brain: So how busy and stressful is work going to be tomorrow?
I think this bit has legs, I would love to see more "Brain" interaction videos.
OK so Ryan has become a therapist now (which is probably what the Pitch Meetings were preparing for all this time) and looking at the comments I am after all not the only one who’s brain obsesses over all the dumb, cringey things I have said and done through my life - c’mon brain, surely you can remember one thing as clearly that I did/said that was good or funny or just moderately OK?  My wife wakes up at 3:00am and worries about things that happened hundreds of years ago.
Ok these are more funny when they arent so realistic. Im going to remember making this comment later before I fall asleep and be concerned that you thought I was actually annoyed, but I was just trying to make a complement by making a joke.
Ha you are wrong its 2 am
OCD is like this but 10 times worse
Yyyyup. That whole "something is in your room!" issue, aka troxler effect, gets me every night about 45 minutes after I fall asleep... ie, right when REM starts to kick in. Thanks Brain, for making my eyes open enough to "see" shapes and try to superimpose imagery from my dreams into my bedroom.
Me watching this at 3AM:
i relate more to the 7 am
super relatable, barely even a coincidence
Dear Ryan, thank you so much for clearing all my doubts related to Mind-body problem. My professor even struggled to explain me. Finally i learned something from YouTube :-D
I want an entire series on this.
my brain at 3 am: Hey kid gotta wake you up cuz you haven't thought about work prep enough I decided just now and even though it's pointless to think about how you're gonna organize your next classes at this point in time I really think we should do a run through ok buddy? Also, remember how chaotic today's class was? That's on you THAT'S ALL ON YOU
I watched Ryan George's video at 3 am (GONE WRONG) NO CLICKBAIT 100%
My brain and my cat have the same agenda at 3AM - keep me from sleeping
If I could talk to my brain, I’d give it a piece of my mind
Haha that’s def me. Especially cuz my sleep schedule is up and down
I know this guy! He lives within me but since Ryan has made a joke about it That means he is so much more common that it is funny.
So f**king funny😂 f**k you for being so funny🤣
It was a bad idea to watch this at midnight...
I was blown away when a character in the Mark Walberg movie Infinity says  "It'll be easy.  Barely an inconvenience."
This video is just another piece of evidence that we are all part of the same consciousness. We all have these universal things that we share. Like Bill Hicks said, “we are all part of the same consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves.”
Hahaaahahaha!!! do more of these please
Relatability aside, 00:11 IS THAT GANGSTER'S PARADISE!?!  Edit: 1:26 AND AGAIN!?
Awesome Ryan, my brain is definitely like that too lol
Plot twist: there was actually a clone who was trying to escape...
Why does everyone out there in the every day world act like this never happens to them? Makes my nightbrain even worse, that does.
Me watching this at 3:00 am: ah yes
You should do one about your bodies sounds and how we interpret them
Finally subscribed. I'm always getting these in my suggested so Youtube knows I want to
This video is so accurate!
7 a.m. a second guy wearing a shirt with a banana and 2 oranges and he's just suuuuuuper excited and energetic. *Hi I'm morning wood*
I want more of this, please make this a series
That’s exactly how my brain works.
I missed read the title 'ryan jerks at 3 am '🤣🤣
This is why I exercise after work in the afternoon instead of in the morning
Oooh, enough talent to carry two channels is tight!
hahahhahahahahahah
I really want to see an unedited version of the footage from these videos.
Me at 3AM:  "Sooo, you have a ton of traumasizing thoughts and memories for me? Brain: "YES SIR I DO!"
I always love ryans videos but i think this is my favourite
This is me every time I sleep! Pray for me, guys!
Sounds about right.
Magnificent. If there ever comes a time when your marvelous brain cannot come up with a video, I will happily rewatch all the old ones, because they are terrific.
Congrats on making it to trending!
Lol
My brain at 5am:  Brain: Hey you  Me: me?  Brain: yea you stupid, you know that guy that you watch on your phone has a name like mine but the "A" and "I" is the wrong way round and he drops the "b"?  Me:...mmm... yea I think so...  Brain: yea go watch his videos, I mean all of them, don't stop watching them, if you stop I'll engeorge myself and you'll die, probably I dunno.  Me:you mean engorge?  Brain: no the extra e is important... nvm just go to sleep  Me: hmm wonder what B̶rian Engeorge is doing rn...  Brain:God Damnit.
I just get confused thoughts about things that go on... Odd systems that I don't understand, sometimes visual images, relating to real life things I've been doing or just completely new stuff. Nothing I can use for an idea for something, just solutions to non-existent problems based on my real experiences. I hate it, it usually happens on hot nights where I'm having trouble sleeping, and I'm just tossing and turning in a state of semi-conciousness.
First guy to decide to print money, and first guy to decide to store money electronically  "Hi there hello, this specific piece of paper and others like it but with different numbers has value now I decided"
Where is the adstraunut
So its like this for everyone huh...im glad im not alone 😂😂😂
That’s me rn it’s 12 am and I have to get up for a big day… *brain* dang it I keep on watching videos!
fuckin capitalist. good video, tho
Sometimes my brain doesn't work so brain
My brain at 3 AM Ah! Ryan George posted a video 5 hours ago that you forgot to watch. Watch it now! Love the vid
Y'know when your thoughts are like talking to each other? i just like to imagine different parts of my brain just split up and hold a conference meeting when that happens
11 y.o. me : *doesn't look where she goes and bumps into a guy in school * Wow. That was pretty embrassing. Thankfully, I'll probably forget that soon enough.  My brain, 10 years later, 3 a.m. : HEY, REMEMBER THAT TIME YOU BUMPED INTO A GUY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL ?
This one was the funniest lmfao
He forgot about when you're trying to sleep and then you start to hear the demonic screech.     Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Better than the MCU.
I wish it was at least this simple. Depression is a bitch
I don't know where you get your ideas man but it is hilarious.
My brain (any time there's a weird sound): Oh hey, that demon is here again. Oh, no that's just the wind. *15 seconds later* My brain: Hey, so about that demon that was here earlier...
Are you trying to sleep? Contemplate everything that has ever happened to you over the past 10 years and all the things you failed at. Then think that you can better yourself, that your going to become the best in the world tomorrow, just for you to wake up wanting to spend the rest of the day in bed watching anime
Who else is watching this at 3 AM
accurate af
Me trying to sleep: My brain: remember every cringy thing you ever did
That's me!
I was actually thinking that I am the only one who goes through this situation, as no one in my family does... But when I saw these comments *OH BOY, I WAS WRONG!*
Go back to movie reviews?
This isn't a sketch, this is a documentary.
Wow... your brain go easy on you...
I’m guessing that story about telling a joke in high school actually happened to this guy 😂
literally me the last few nights before my biochem exam, so glad the exam is over hopefully can get a full night sleep in.
"Are we dying right now" Me: Y e s.
Ngl, this vid would have been more fitting for a 3am drop
"yeah, we're not doing that" "I know" Lmaoo
I'm glad I'm not the only one that has these thoughts, but WHY do we have these thoughts when we're supposed to be sleeping?
Facts
Ooooooh yeah. It am coming together.
Definitely read that as "Brians are jerks at 3am", which I also agree with.
Lol
0:11 "as I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, i take a look at my life..."
Brains are so annoying am I right? 🤣🤣🤣 Edit: *I SAID BRAIN ARE SO ANNOYING AM I RIGHT?* 🤣🤣🤣
Me at 3AM: "Time to sleep" Brain at 3AM: "It is super dark out... I wonder if there will be creepy noises or sirens going down the street. How about an ice cream truck. Ah remember all the scary shows you  recently watched? I will name them."
OMG SO TRU
I was kinda hoping he would get scared of the same coat a second time shortly after turning the light back off. I get those sometimes.
The witching hour. OF COURSE!
I freaking LOVE this guy!!!
Existential crises? Super easy. Definitely an inconvenience
Contemplating the inevitability of death is a great way to fall asleep.
Me: Tries to sleep My brain: Hey, remember that guy you liked back in Freshman Year, and you gave him notes and probably creeping him out because you’re socially awkward and stupid? yeah let’s ponder on that for 3 hours. 😈
Ooh, not present things speculated by the brain is tight!
Hah, so true. And it's even worse for an artist…3AM is when the best ideas for stories or other such projects come to mind, and then you either can't sleep because you're so worked up about how great it's gonna be that you end up spending the rest of the night making it or stewing until morning when you're supposed to do stuff, or you fall back asleep and hate yourself in the morning for totally forgetting your brilliant idea. I'm actually going through that right now, I should be sleeping after surgery but my brain is just like "Hey, here's a great change to that fight scene in that chapter you were working on that I suddenly came up with, go play a super-intense battle in a video game to get in the mood and then write it! Like, now! You're not sleeping now, no, nuh-uh, you're gonna go play a big fight scene in a video game so you can write a big fight scene in the story you're working on right this second in the middle of the night even though you just had surgery!" (DISCLAIMER: It was a relatively minor surgery, I'm not like in pain or waiting for a surgical cut to heal or anything like that, but still, I'm supposed to be sleeping off the last of the anesthetic right now!)
"Someones inside the house" Yeah, you
usally 3am videos are clickbait and weird but this one this one i like
Omg, I fell asleep with this channel open on my phone so that I could binge watch older videos and now I woke up and it's like genie granted me a video YAY!! 💖💓
Why do I feel like that high school story was real
I read it as “Brian’s are jerks at 3 AM like 4 times.”
Love it!
Just stay awake past 3am. You won't even hear the alarm
The brain at 3:00 AM: *You cannot rest now, there are monsters nearby*
I like his “I know” at the end
My entire body: “I’m fucking exhausted.” Me: “Okay then, guess I’ll go to sleep.” My brain: **maniacal laughter**
My favorite is when my brain screams at me that I need sleep, but also forces me to stare at my ceiling for 4 hours first. :(
I love pizza!
Lol, hilarious, and SO true!
Kinda disappointed this video in particular wasn’t sponsored by sheets and giggles lol
Literally me right now. It's 3:40 I start my new job today at 11. But I live backed to a park and I there are these two business guys who sometimes sit and talk right near my back garden. I just told them my worries and they were like 'everything will be okay'. And my cat came in from his walk and it was so relevant to this video.
My brain at 3AM: There's always one direction where you never look, but when you turn around, there will be another direction you can't look.
Just so you know I’m watching this right before I go to bed
Hey I’m watching this at 3AM
I love these concepts🤣🤣 you should do a "if body parts could talk" bit🤣🤣
God why r all his vids so funny thou
3am discussions are tight
If you get stuck on something you regret, just remember, everyone has a chapter they don't read aloud.
"You try to run straight and true, but somewhere along the line you get dirty. But if you keep your eyes on the road, keep looking forward, sooner or later the mud will dry up and the dirt will fall off." ~~Catherine from the anime Gintama
10pm: omg im gonna get so much done tmrw lets do this and this then this and this 3am: fuck u and ur lonely and just fuck u 3pm: hey u slept in and now u dont have time to do the things u wanted to do
This is by far the most accurate video ever Ryan
Yup. My brains an a$$h*Le too 😂
Were you a jerk in past, were you? It would be bloody surprising.
This. Is. My. Life.
is going for a jog in the morning difficult? ................ ;)
IM AWAKE NOW AT 3AM BECAUSE MY BRAIN IS SUBSCRIBED TO RYAN'S CHANNEL...
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT of my life!
Me and my brain at 3am: Huh? What?  Mysterious sensation: Hi.  Me and my brain at 3am: What the hell are you?  Mysterious sensation: I'm your pea-sized bladder yeah we gotta go pee now.  Me and my brain at 3am: Oh FFS.  Mysterious sensation: I don't know why you think I'm so mysterious I do this to you every night you should just set your clock for 2:55am.  Me and my brain at 3am: Why would I do that?  Mysterious sensation: so I can start waking you up at one.
this was pretty good.... the ol' morning existential-dread-and-promise-to-exercise deal
This is my brain 24/7. Thanks I hate it.
Thanks!
I have a love/hate relationship with my brain, especially at 3 AM
The first guy to ever lie
This is why I can't get sleep at night my brain is just like that.
redditors making memes
The way he just sunk into the bed 🤣
Hi there, hello. I am commenting so this channel can get more attention. Carry on with your life. Hope you have a nice day and rest of your extremely long life. Bye.
Brain, I'm gonna need you to get ALL the way off my back about the embarrassing memories
I've just watched this gone 3AM (UK time)!
At Halloween when I was six my brothers and I came to one house where a young couple lived. The guy came to the door and said his wife usually makes treats for the kids, but she wasn't feeling well. So he had made some mini pumpkin muffins himself. When we got home I thought it looked lumpy or something, and gave it to my brother. He ate both his and mine and said they were great. That was SIXTY YEARS AGO, and it still haunts me at night sometimes, thinking how nice the guy was and how hurt he would be if he knew I didn't eat the muffin he made.
My everyday life 😫
Dude!!!!!!! You are extra super funny!
I've got my dumb brain right where I want it. It doesn't bother me at all...it must have given up after years of neglect, abuse, and aggressively being ignored. Playing the long game has paid off.
No “I decided” in this video...
This wasn't funny. And the idea for this bit has been done a million times
🤣🤣🤣
Brain: *sudden adrenaline and memories* Me: "Okay brain, I'm going to need you to get ALL THE WAY off my back and let me sleep."
I legit just had a horrible hallucination last night so I have a fresh memory of what how annoying my brain is when I'm sick.
More of these!!!!
When you can't sleep and open Youtube to find this video
“Yeah, we’re not doing that,” says MY brain every day about going for a jog! 😱
Oh man did the jog thing really hit home for me 😅
Real.
This is me when I go to sleep
me brain at 3AM: WE NEED TO CODE! WE NEED TO FIX THAT BUG!
thought it was a Bo Burnham reference because of the thumbnail, nice video tho <3
*takes 3am piss* Brain: "Time to wake up."
This video is so accurate in ways I cannot explain
Brain: Remember that one time in camp when you were an annoying prick?
Me drifting off to sleep... Brain: Psst. Hey. Hey. Yo. Hey. Me: WHAT. Brain: Remember that conversation you were having earlier today where you couldn't think of a clever thing to say so you kind of bumbled and felt like you messed up? Me: Urgh, yeah. Why? Brain: Lets run those lines again, I'm feeling fresh right now and I know we can nail something awesome. Me: But that's in the past, thinking up a good line now isn't going to do any good. I just want to sleep. Brain: That sounds nice but no. Here comes the first re-play...
Ryan really created the best video on youtube.
I refuse to believe that Ryan ever told an unfunny joke. He probably made that up to humanize himself.
*My Brain Right Before Bed:* You know, we could really change things around. This life, could be so much better. Tomorrow we are gonna do all the things, every single one of em. We'll finish that coding project, we'll apply for that college, we'll clean up the house so spotless.  *Waking Up:* Yeah, that's gonna be a no for me dog.
God that was good.
Well that shot of adrenaline thing definitely comes to my mind 😏.
Too accurate :D
I definitely need a "The First Guy To Ever Rickroll Someone" video.
I think all the brains have a universe like Monsters Inc and they take turns messing with us
My brain at 3am: pssst, theres an alien demon standing right over you and watching you  Me: 👽         🙄
Me sleeping at 3 AM peacefully until  Me: So you have a nightmare for me? Brain: Yes sir I do!
This was hilariously accurate 🤣
Honestly, this is my favorite video of yours!!! Haven't laughed like that in ages!!! :D
I'm gonna start blaming my brain for thing, like it's not... me.
This is exactly what happens to me all the time. This was perfect.
pensé que era willyrex
Story of my life lmaooo
Then after you try to start work your brain just says “nope”
LOL. It's like our brains have been cross-contaminated with cat DNA. Doing zero to sixty when all we want is a little rest and shut-eye.
Ok... it is now exactly 2:59 am here, and I just finished this video....
Brain: Hey, that feels like a spider crawling on you.  Me: No, that's just a twitch. It happens to us all the time.  Brain: Yeah, probably. Or it could be a spider. You should probably smack yourself on the arm, just to be on the safe side.  Everyone else in the room: Why is that nutcase slapping himself?
Watching this at 3am feels very meta
Me: So you have cringe memory for me?  Brain at 2am: Yes, sir, I do!
It's 3am
Watching this at 3am
Thank you for making me laugh! Kinda need one 😆
*Me :* * _watching this at 2:50 AM_ * "I should probably go to sleep"  *My brain :* * _tries to think of a funny comment and it's now actually 3 AM because 10 minutes have now past because of that_ *  *Also me :* "Damn I lost so much time,  I should definitely go to sleep...  Maybe, probably..."
#41 on trending damn
So true
Spot on, every time! Stupid brains. The line about giving you some adrenaline to survive killed me! And the way you delivered that line; "It's a coat. It's a jacket." With the quavering voice... LOL! You're actually a really good actor :-)
Not long enough but way too funny.
i wanna see the first person make a video game please
Too acurate
Did the high school accident happened for real ?
Sequel video: My bladder at 3:00am
Me every night 🥲
Bold of you to assume I'm trying to sleep at 3am
So hilarious!
On point again. Very good
"A coat, a jacket" "A jacket, a coat"
Oh. my. gosh. this is so freaking relatable
No ads at the end? I have to say quite disappointed not seeing the adstronaut ☹️ weirdly looking forward to those
This is the ultimate embodiment of us being our own worst enemies - AND I LOVE IT.
This probably happened to him and decided to make a skit about it. Life of a youtuber.
I'm watching this at 3am
In the RGCU, even coats are played by Ryan George. :-D
so true haha
Hey, remember how Game of Tbrones ended?
The person in the corner made me die laughing!
LOL
#40 on trending, let's get it Ryan.
Existential crisis is tight!
I feel like I need a Ryan George vs Alasdair Beckett-King collab. Or cagematch. Or collab cagematch.
LOL
Awesome video Ryan.
Your brain is like that creepy cousin that stays the night at your house occasionally
yep.
What? No addstronaut today? :(
I read the title as "Brian's are jerks at 3am" and I was a bit confused, then by brain was activated and realized either title is accurate 🤪
This hits too close to home
Who's Brian?
To get the full experience i watched this at 3am
So accurate
Its the replayed arguments that I always win in retrospect for me. But somehow it  doesn't make you feel any better. #Hollowvictories
And a lousy day turned out not so bad thanks to you, spot-on good sir!
A couple of months ago my brain tricked me into thinking a raccoon was crawling through my open window when it was instead my fan doing what it always does...
Congrats on trending!
Search here for (Rockcandy Live In Toronto 1988) featuring Buffalo Music Hall of Fame singer song writer Joie Anes!     Enjoy the music!!!
Sup bruh brain here remember her?      Yea you remember her...she's married with kids now...good night! :D
Brains are basically always jerks
The idea of an encounter between "me" and "my brain" is really the dead end of Western philosophy :))
Truest video ive ever watched
My brain at three in the morning: If there is a mass murderer in our house do I go to the police officer neighbor that just had a baby or the police officer neighbor where my arch nemesis lives? What would it feel like to get stabbed? What would I tell 911? There's a murderer in our house?? That sounds too cheesy...  Me: can you shut up?  My Brain: yeah, yeah, but what if-
I liked this because.....I remembered.
Yes sir
And it’s trending??
Lmao this is incredibly accurate
I have never related to something so much in my life!
yeah, wish I could trade in my brain for something more helpful.. 😑
This is... Painfully relatable
*the first guy to ever milk a cow*
btw, someone IS INSIDE the house. Its bo burnham stealing the comedy genius spotlight
Watching this at 5 am is super scary really an inconvenience.
Me watching this at almost 3 am
Me watching this at almost 3 am
Every time it pops up the time it kinda sounds like the first synthesizer note to the intro of gangsters paradise.
It’s almost like Ryan seen my message on the last video about too many “the 1st guy” videos. Ryan, if you’re looking, how about Fight Club pitch meeting?
HOW DID RYAN GET AN ACTUAL RECORDING OF ME AND MY BRAIN?!
Okay, this one is somewhat standalone in originality and brilliance. Great job.
I see getting inside my brain was super easy barely an inconvenience 🤣😂
Hilarious
LMAO!!!!! YES. I definitely go through this most nights, its the worst
I was drinking coffee during the football player comment... Took everything I had not to spit it all over my computer... Almost worked!
Brains are so difficult
I am literally at this point now😂😂😂
Gotta love it when your brain thinks of comebacks for arguments you got into 12 hours ago at 3AM when you're trying to sleep
*inhales* COME ON GUY, I PROMISE EVERYTHING WILL BE ALRIGHT, BE OK, YOUR EYES ARE TIRED BUT KEEP EM OPEN CAUSE YOU WOULDN’T WANT TO MISS A THING
That's exactly how my brain is.
Ryan as 'shadow man' is terrifying
Brain as a person should become a mini series. Heart as a person as well until they have a crossover...which one will you listen to?
Or sometimes you get epiphanies or light bulb moments that gotta he written down.
So weird..this was exacly me lastnight!!
*How* would your own cognitive organ keep you from falling asleep? Actually, super easy barely an inconvenience. Oh really? Overthinking and memories.
hahahahaahaha.
I have night terrors, so I get this from my brain:  "Hey, you feel that? Something's in the room with us" [OPEN EYES AND LOOK AT WALL] [POV: A BLACK SHAPE ON THE WALL NEXT TO THE BATHROOM MOVES SLIGHTLY, AND STARTS TO FORM INTO SOMETHING DEMONIC WITH GLOWING EYES. IT STEPS OUT OF THE WALL AND STARTS MOVING TOWARDS ME] "Obviously that's not real, this is a night terror... you've had thousands of them. Let's go back to sleep" [IGNORE DEMON, CLOSE EYES] "But, what if it wasn't?"
My brain at 3AM "Oh are we finally getting to bed? Here have some cool dreams for a cool dude."
Im so glad im not the only one
Pahahah YASSSS 👍
Brain:  Hey, remember this random unimportant event that happened 20 years ago?  Me:  I have literally not thought of that since then.  Why is that even still in my memory somewhere?  Brain:  I don't know, but what about this other random unimportant memory you've also not thought about in 20 years?
This is tight!
2AM here.
I LOLed. Like for real. Out loud. Twice!
So relatable unfortunately...
Lol so true
Daniel thrashed vibes
Watched this at 1:11 AM
I love this guy
Brain at very early in the morning: "Remember that really embarrassing moment...?"
There has gotta be a reason this happens to all of us, right?
more brains are jerks schetches please
I read that very wrong
I’ve never enjoyed being called out this much before
Painfully true...
Surprised his bladder didn't join in and  decided that , since you're awake we should relieve ourselves.
oh this is so relatable
0:00 star shaped Ryan
I love your work so much. You are a national ...no ...international treasure. That's it. That's the comment.
My mind also tries to stress me out every night. "Isn't that right, brain"? "I can't see your brain"!
When I'm really tired all my thoughts blend together and start to make no sense, like I'm be thinking that the Lakers need to make a trade so they don't fail English
Hold up, I'm still confused. Is it a jacket or a coat?????
So damn true
You have a tuhtoo
This is how me and my brain works at night.
Awww not being able to sleep at 3 am because your brain is being a jerk is TIGHT!
The apex predators of an entire planet, ladies and gentlemen.
Every night my mind reminds me that my entire life has been a series of cringe moments
Doesn’t happen to me. I’m to busy watching frikin teen Titans at 3am
Hundreds of thousands of years of survival instincts can’t be bred out with two generations of excess. Nor should it. Funny ass skit though.
So true. Give this man the Gold Medal of Humour and Finesse!
One of the most relatable ones haha
*Gets recommended this at 3AM *
Then there's me on brain-provided adrenaline: "That could be a **murderer** in the corner of the room and yes, I could turn on the light just to be sure but I don't have the energy for that."
This was literally me last night/this morning, but it was 2AM 😄
Ryan George, I love you with all my heart ❤️
This might be your best one yet, and you already had set the bar super high.
How did you get my brain to star in your video?
I like that he says he’s got a big day tomorrow, but technically tomorrow was already here.
He could have easily made this the length of a pitch meeting,  i wish he would've.  It would be super easy,  barely an inconvenience
Holy crap is that relatable.
All these personal attacks
This just happened to me yesterday. brain @ 3:30am "you know that thing that one person asked you to do that you don't have to think about until next august? yea, I want to think all about it now, I decided." me "there is literally nothing I can do until the time gets closer, lets go back to sleep." brain "no, I like thinking about what i might think about at the time when thinking is going to make a difference." <two hours later> brain " ok, I am good, you can go back to sleep now" me "I have to get up to go to work in 1 hour" brain " well you should have thought of that before you stayed up to think last night" me "AAAAAAHHHHHGGGGG!!!!"
Ha, all these people talking about their brains being annoying at night. My brain is annoying all the time! Middle of the day: "Hey, remember that kind of rude thing you said to your friend a few years ago that you know they've completely forgiven and forgotten? Wouldn't that ruin your whole friendship if they were secretly dwelling on it this whole time and really hate you even though it's been years and you still do everything together?"
The jog thing is so relatable
U should do the first guy to ever sing
Fantastic ending dude 🤣
Relatable....
0:56 Bug on wall vibing.
So other people's brains are like this.....like....only at 3AM? Like this isn't a constant thing for everyone else? Cool. Just gonna go weep then
And you are going to stop procrastinating first thing tomorrow! No, better yet get up and get started right now!
You forgot the part where I turn off the light and my brain says "wait, what if this time there might actually be a killer in the room!"
Overactive brains are TIGHT.
Me: [Looks under bed.] Under the bed: Hi! Hello there!
Alarm is set for 6am....try falling asleep at 10pm. Still awake at 11, still awake at 1130. the countdown in my head begins...7 hours left, 6 1/2 hours left. Finally i sleep. Wake up to pee at 3am. Oh god only 3 hours left. Still awake at 4am 2 hours to just get a nap in....
I feel attacked by this video
Literally happening this with me...
Me watching this at 3am…
Why did my brain read it as "people are being jerks at 3am"?
*My brain at **3:00**:* Hey, you trying to go to sleep? *Me:* Well, I mean, I just went to bed. So, yeah? *My Brain:* Right. No job and surviving on government subsidies. Anyway, want to contemplate your inescapable mortality?" *Me:* Not really. I'm trying _really hard_ to just think about wizards fighting duels with energy swords until I eventually drift to sleep. *My Brain:* You _do_ realize you'll eventually have to confront the fact that you're going to die, right? *Me:* Hey, let me ask you something. Is getting a good night's sleep more likely to prolong my life or shorten it? *My brain:* ... *Me:* Yeah, that's what I thought. Now shut up, I need to think about wizard duels.
Me, before every test/presentation: OK now all I need to do is get a good night's rest and everything will be fine. Brain: That sounds like a good plan, so I thought we'd do, you know, the exact opposite of that. Me: But why? Brain: I'm gonna need you to get aaaall the way off my occipital lobe about that.
My brain every night
This is honestly so relatable
So accurate and relatable lmao
My 3:00 a.m. Brain:  WHAT DID YOU FORGET AT WORK THAT WILL RUIN EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE WILL BE MAD YOU DEFINITELY FORGOT SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS FORGET WHY DO YOU FORGET REMEMBER WHEN YOU FORGOT YOUR DAD'S BIRTHDAY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Bed reveal
*Ryan:* _"I thought you said we were going for a jog in the morning!"_ *Brain:* _"Whoops."_ *Ryan:* _"Whoopsie."_
I seriously live for any video from you.. thank you!
Side-splitting funny! 😄😆😅🤣😂
Missing the bit where you're just about fall asleep and brain is all, "ADRENALIIIIIINE!!!" and you jerk so hard you almost fall out of bed... is that just me?
In a sea of click baits, tiktok and Worse its good to know there still excellent content on YouTube.  Your channel is like a beacon of hope and light and all things good in an ocean of shit content that is YouTube nowadays
this is far too accurate
Where’s the adstronaut
Excellent!
I get along well with my brain. But my penis is the biggest dick you'll ever meet.
I'm an army veteran, 3am brain activity is insane. Love this shit.
That’s EXACTLY what my brain does every night at 3 AM, verbatim! 😳😳😳
So true hahahahaha
I now imagine my anxiety as Ryan George.  🤣🤣🤣 Thank you!
Oh, thinking a ghost or a murderer is there to kill you is tight!
3:51 am
Brains are jerks
🤣
Your brain is like that, too? I am not alone 😍
The 2 most recent  videos have been really on the ball
Watching this and reading the comments actually makes me feel good inside. We all have so much in common no matter our background or where we're from. That thought brings me comfort and hope for a brighter future.
Hey, at least, if he had time to jog, he probably didn't have work to do, so he can just rest some more.
This has been the past 30 years of my life. I'm 30.
Oh look a completely new character in RGCU (Ryan George cinematic universe). How exciting!!
*The first guy to do a piercing* That would be HILARIOUS to watch ... not that videos right now aren't hilarious..... but still
Perfect timing, I woke up at 3 this morning not knowing why 😂
Brain: hey, do you want to remember that cringey thing you did in high school? Me: a cringey thing in high school? do you have the slightest idea how little that narrows it down? Also no, I don’t want to remember that. Brain: well too bad, cause here it is. Me: thanks for that... Brain: and while we’re on the subject, here’s some more cringey memories. Me: stop it. Why can’t you recall my more positive memories this clearly? Brain: I don’t know. Me: Fair enough. Actually no, not fair enough.
The other video about the MCU....I'm glad you posted that one.  Those of us who aren't funny every single time we put something on the internet are glad you can put something thats just meh.  Anyway, back to the awesomeness with this video
Get out of my head!!!!!!
Never ever sleep at 3 am! A guy named Joseph Mama died after sleeping at 3 am!
My brain at 3 am is designing Lego MOCs, but by mourning it forgets everything
I would definitely buy a t-shirt that said it's a jacket it's a coat
It is 3:38am here right now
3.00 AM.........past embarrassing moments hour
At least the 7:00 AM brain is a bro
ME:   binge watching this channel for a week now not getting anything done.  MY BRAIN :   don't you have work to do? It's gonna be pretty hard to stay employed if you don't go to work.  ME: actually it's gonna be super easy bearly and inconvenience!
Brain describes him drinking a very large margarita.  Him waking up at seven,  hey why is there salt around the toilet seat?
My brain when I have an important early morning: you must sleep early so you don't oversleep, you must sleep early so you don't oversleep, you must sleep early so you don't oversleep, you must sleep early so you don't oversleep, you must sleep early so you don't oversleep, you must sleep early so you don't oversleep Yeah, no, then I don't sleep at all...
Where can I acquire a brain t-shirt like that?
Me at 3 AM: Time to get confortable, sleep well, time to have good dreams. My brain at 3 AM: What if there's a hidden cockroach somewhere in your room? Me: Fuck.
1:22 😢💔
Gonna go ahead and give us a shot of adrenaline to survive this encounter.
All of this is spookily accurate. 😂
Omg...just...all of this 🤣🤣🤦🏼‍♀️
Love this guy!
this is always amplified after watching a good horror movie too lol
So dang funny 😆 and so dang true.
Once again, Order of Canada material for keeping us entertained and laughing during a global pandemic
Going through this right now as I go to sleep
My thoughts at night: Hey, you remember that song you like? I'm gonna play that on repeat. Let's play reruns of sudokus (other puzzles) you made. Here's an awesome idea for a cake you could bake. You should look up if there is a recipe for something like that.
46 downvotes. 40k likes. Lol.
If my brain could have a conversation with me I would always be happy.
I hate how relatable this is..
Aw man soooo relatable
Sometimes I wonder if I'm even normal, because this is supposedly SUCH a universal experience and I've never had that even once in three decades of my life so far...
yeah the room being dark is one reason why i leave my fairy lights on
My life in 2 minutes.
Been awake since 3am really.  It’s now 5.48am.  I pressed the like button and I’m turning this off.  I hope I’m able to sleep and jog at 7am. Wish me luck.
I was sure he was gonna say, "Are you sure you didn't leave the stove on?"
I am actually watching this on 3pm
... That happened last night. The moment I felt myself drift away "Hey! You know, I know it is hard to sleep but we have all of these things to do tomorrow!" *Drifting off again* "Babababababa-ooomamamowmow- bababa-oomamamowow, suuurrrfffiiinnn biiirrrdd!"
We're gonna get so much work done tomorrow my guy.
We all hate you, brain; we do.
my brain does this at 4AM
This has to be your best one so far…which says a lot, because the “naming tools” one has me in stitches every time I watch it. Awesome work!
Me: Okay time to sleep My brain: Hey remember that ryan george video you wanted to watch...
GONE WRONG 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Gold
It’s actually therapeutic to talk to ur brain like a person if ur having trouble sleeping. Just tell it to shut up cuz u need rest.
100%
This universe is very cool
Yeeeeeeep.... I'll take it as your review for Bo Burnham's INSIDE . .
No adstronaut today?
Is it a coincidence that i am watching this at 3 am 🤣🤣
What asshole would thumbs down this?
At 3am, every nose is a ghost trying to kill you.
My brain always brings up my cringey past.
Hey, remember that time when you were 8 and your tried to do a puzzle but your mom put it away before you could finish, and you never actually finished the puzzle?
had the idea for the video at 3 am?
lmao...Ryan, you're the best man!  😂
My gawd yes why is it always 3am and these are my thoughts exactly. Am I dying? I’m probably dying right now or it’s gonna happen in a few minutes why was I loser in high school/at work/college… lol
I've never related to something more 😂😂
This is the truest video on YouTube
My brain right now: Lets just watch just ooooooone more video! Also my brain: Lets do it! High five!
That was defiantly a person ...
My brain at 3am: I AM GOING TO DIE 😲
Me, watching at 1am : tell me about it
Hah my brain simply doesn't let me sleep instead
why are you personally attacking me?
As somebody with crippling anxiety and depression, it is this but not just at 3AM. Thanks Ryan, for the brief moments of levity your excellent videos always provide.
Brain:  "Hey remember when you thought the people in your friend groups liked you in high school, but as you watch high schoolers now, you realize they only just tolerated you because they were too socially awkward themselves to confront you about how terrible of a person you were"  Me: "......."  Brain:  "How about we just pick a random high school friend and focus on every painful detail of every single instance you were a creepy jerk towards them until you feel the urge to go on a massive Facebook apology spree"  Me:  "GAAAAAAH"
too true :(
I think the only reason we're so motivated when we go to sleep, is because we know we don't have to do anything then and there. 😂
I'm watching this @3am...
Sometimes I wish I could slap my brain.
Agreed
I feel like that high school story legitimately happened
That's not his brain, that's his roommate with the name Brain
Every friggin' night.
Funniest person on the internet strikes again.  :-)
Man, I hate those nights when my brain randomly decides I don't need sleep, and it would rather have a one-sided gab session all night.
In literally watching it at 3am. It's 3am in india right now and that ghost part actually scared me a little bit.
So relatable
Brain at 3am: hey! remember that argument you were having but you couldn't counter their points? y'know if you had said this, you could have won the argument. Me: oh yeah! why didn't you tell me then.  Brain: Oh! I saw you jump into an argument without talking to me first so when I saw you starting to sound like an idiot, I thought I might as well get a popcorn and enjoy the show.
My brain at 3am Brain: Average life expectancy is 78. I'm 38 now. I've lived almost half my life. Omg, I'm gonna be dead soon.  Then end up eating half gallon of ice cream
3:30 AM Bladder: "I know you just fell asleep, but I really need you to do something for me"
the problem with Brains is you must teach them to act better ! you must practice your brains to do better or you suffer from this things even more .
omfg… so true 0:15
This better be a recurring series.
So, so relatable
Brain: "We have a very big day tomorrow, we're gonna need our rest!" Me: "Yeah, I know, it's just-" Brain: "Oh no, what if we ARE tired tomorrow? Lemme give you a shot of adrenaline to help you through this life-or-death situation!" Me: "To help me sleep!?" Brain: "Whoops" Me: "Whoopsie"
Accurate ASF!!
I sometimes go downstairs at night if i hear anything ,to check if the door is locked.
Its good to see this not only happens with me
What makes the even funnier is that for me, It's 5 And the vid was 2 hrs ago               So for me this was posted at 3am XD
My brain: *ah yes you are now really inspired and starving :) goodnight*
I think I will watch the rest tomorrow in day light
Very relatable… 😂
That shadow looks familiar
Yeah. I have trouble sleeping just *knowing* that my brain is often in the same room as me.
I'm watching this at 3 am. Just the way it was meant to be.
I remember one terrifying time when I had sleep paralysis. I thought there was someone in my room walking towards my bed and I looked at the ceiling and saw hundreds of giant cockroaches and they were all falling down on my head. I tried to scream but couldn't. The single worst nightmare I've ever had in my life.  Yep. My brain was a jerk. Thankfully that's the one and only time it's ever happened to me. Usually my jerk brain just goes through everything I've done throughout the day and makes me question myself.
Oh no! This is meeeeeee!
Brain : I'm going to need you to stay up and stress out over nothing for the next few hours, I decided. It'll be barely an inconvenience. Me : Oh really?
Let’s be honest, this could be a whole series by itself.
I had that too many times,where i say a joke,no one laughs,so i tell it to 1 person,he doesn't laugh,so i make a joke about the thing i joked about.
DO COLLABORATION WITH DANIEL THRASHER PLEASE!
My brain at 3AM:  Wake up.......now watch that video from the guy who thinks Atlantis is  the big eye in the desert....
Lol you're not even trying
everything except for the fear of someone standing in your room is relatable, forgot that when i was 12
Me: "Didn't we say we were going for a jog this morning?"  Brain: " Listen, I'm going to need you to get all the way off my back about jogging today."  Me:"Oh, let me get off of that thing."
lol
It's not the brain's fault. Brain is just trying to keep you safe in a totally different setting. Brain doesn't understand home, and walls, and law. Brain understands "bad thing can hurt" and spends all it's time trying to avoid that, even if it is to remind you of when you did it to yourself. If your brain tells you mean things late at night, remember, it's only looking out for you. Just in a really awkward way.
Me: No one: Absolutely Everyone: ...  Brain: Remember that time you wet the bed when you were 21-- Me: SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT! UP!... Brain: Cuz I remember, I never let you forget, and your friends won't either. Me: Okay, time to think about Skyrim. Brain: (gasps) DUDE, Bretons are the best race! Me: Absolutely.
It’s funny cuz it’s true
Hello
YEAH BUT OK DID IT HAVE TO BE QUITE SO REAL THOUGH OMG
This is probably the worlds most accurate representation of the brain at 3am, you probably called out a few billion brains in the space of 2 minutes x
_Hey there, look, I know that we watched that horror movie pretty late but we really should spend the next few hours wide awake._ "What, why?" _Well, I just don't feel safe in this house._ "The house we've spent several years in, and not once had any sort of issue?" _Yeah yeah, I just feel like _*_tonight_*_ there's a serial killer lurking nearby.  In fact, we probably should turn on all the lights and clench a baseball bat._ "I gotta say, that feels like a waste of electricity, and a poor time to consider playing baseball." _No see, we'll use that bat to crack open the skull of Slenderman, who I'm _*_pretty_*_ sure is now behind us.  Turn around please.  Right now._ "I know there's just a wall behind me right now.  It's physically impossible for anything else to be behind me.  Also, Slenderman isn't real." _Mhm.  Turn around though.  Just in case._ "Okay... ... It's just the wall." _Oh thank god._
whenever I try to sleep it's just "I am gonna die eventually and I can never escape that fact. I am doomed and I should feel fear right now"
Thought he was gonna make the buddy feel like it was falling too
My brain at 3AM: You see that darkness outside your door? "uh, Yeah" Theirs someone out there "Oh my god"  Ya just close it, okay you closed it "Thank god!"  You need to pee "Yep"
❎ I'm in this photo and I don't like it
To be fair that did look like a person in the dark
Brains are always Jerks, not just at 3AM  Random Itches Intrusive Thoughts (what if I stabbed my eye with these scissors?) When your brain suddenly makes you forget how to walk Bringing up cringey things from 8 years ago Forgetting things in general Reminding you of how big of a failure you are when you make the tiniest mistake  just to name a few...
Ironically, this was uploaded at 3am for me
Did Adstronaut depart for this episode?
It‘s so sad I can only give ONE thumb up. This is so brilliant and relatable, I wanna give all my thumbs … at least
Man i thought i was the only one thinking about everyone i know dying at 3 AM
My brain at 3 am: Ooh! Ryan George uploaded a new video!
Waking up at 7am? Lucky
That was awesome! Great job!
😂😂😂so accurate in every way. One time I had just fallen asleep and I heard this BAM on my window. I open my eyes, someone's shining a light for a split second. I was frozen. Then BAM again. It's like 1am, I'm 18 and my boyfriend was over but in the shower. I couldn't move, I was so scared. I wanted to look out the window but my brain convinced me a robber was (rather loudly) breaking in through my window and if I looked out he would shoot me in the head. The banging followed by a flick of light happened five more times before I finally half crawled out of my room to get my boyfriend.  His brain reacted differently. Instead of freezing, his brain said "I'm gonna grab a small knife and run outside to see what is going on" I didn't agree with this plan but he was dead set on it. I hear yelling, then swearing.   My 60 year old neighbor, a man I had known my entire childhood, had gotten drunk and his brain told him at 2am "hey I wonder why that car I don't recognize is parked in the other neighbors driveway. That house is for sale, that shouldn't be there" and he decided to wake up the 18 year old girl by banging on her bedroom window with the end of a BROOMSTICK and then shine a flashlight into it. How did he even know which bedroom window was mine?!?
As someone with anxiety and a sleeping disorder this is a big mood. Hell I still keep the light on when I fall asleep. And notice a nightlight I mean I literally just don't turn the ceiling light off when I'm in there during the late hours.
Oh my god. This is my brain every night, 3am or not. Especially the "Are we dying? I don't want to speculate but I think we are"
Funniest and most accurate assessment of how my brain functions. All this in under 2 mins!
lol so true 🤣🤣 also which one is the Bain
this is funny
This was me all of last week, alone in my parents' basement while I was dog-sitting.
"we should go for that jog" "...yeah we're not doing that" lmao too relatable
This reminds me of a Daniel Thrasher video
When I wake up at 3:00 am and I never think about these thing
Thanks man I really needed that 😂 my brain is a Jerk .
This is your most relatable skit yet. I love your channel and especially the Pitch Meetings!
So it's a jacket or a coat? Yes
Replace 3 with 5:15 and this is my life
I wish my brain was as nice as that
that coat with the jacket straight up had a hairline and ears, a right arm, and was clealry wearing a t-shirt before he put the light on, that is a magical light.
kind of disappointed sleep paralysis wasn't mentioned
My brain at 3 or 4 a.m.   Today it's, "Did you know your stepmom hates that you can't eat right? Your stepmom hates that." and "That "demon possession" obsession is back again, with a neat dose of "YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB AND YOU'LL DIE ALONE...REMEMBER THAT ONE TIME WE WENT TO BEN AND JERRY'S AND YOU NEVER SAW THE ICE CREAM AGAIN, OR THAT REASON YOU BOUGHT AN XBOX BUT NEVER PLAYED IT AGAIN, LET'S REPEAT THAT. OR THE..."
3 hours online: 200.000 views. Wow wow wow!
Then the brain made him do a backflip, snapped his neck and ended the day!p
That's funny, go for the jog anyway though.
I thought the title was "Break Ins are Jerks at 3 AM"
I feel attacked xD
once i was awake at 3am in bed and i felt like i heard footsteps and creaking it was most likely hallucinations
I would've had another adrenalin hit thinking about that joke.
DON'T TALK TO YOUR BRAIN AT 3AM (NOT CLICKBAIT) (SCARY) (MUST WATCH) (18+)
Brains are jerks,  yes, yes I know. Sadly I truly do...
This happens to me every night.
Blessings Psalms 37:5-6 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday./inspiration+There are no orphans in God’s house. There are no "step-kids." All of us who are led by His spirit are His rightful children. He chose us and He loves us. We are equal in His eyes. God does not have a favorite kid. We are all His favorites. He desires to shower us all with His blessings and He desires us all to be obedient. He loves us equally and disciplines us equally. We are part of one big blended family. /prayer+ Lord, I am so happy to be a child of the King ABBA. You chose me to call yours. You grafted me into Your family and gave me a place to call my own. I am surrounded by Your love and the love of every other believer who is led by Your spirit. In Your family, I will never be orphaned. I will never be alone. Amen.
Welcome to my f******** world.
Stop spying on me in order to get video ideas Ryan, it's creepy.
Brain: "You are running out of time on Earth. You will never find happiness." Me: OH MY GOD.
The 3 am hallucination hit home, my guy. You can make literally anything funny!
Here is a simple comment without any checkmarks. Just you know, diversifying comment section a bit.
It's like he knows! Morning Jogs are tight but sleeping in is super easy! Barely and inconvenience!
Relatable.
basically me and the creature inside my head who controls me and I can control what it says buddy
My brain at 3am: Bathroom time!
"So you've got a basic bodily function for me?" "Yes sir I do, it's called 'sleep' and you definitely need 8 hours of it every day" "8 hours? That's a lot, so is it gonna be easy to get hold of?" "Super easy, barely and inconvenience, just lay down at night and shut your eyes" "And that's gonna work, consistently?"  "Not even a little bit."  "Sound like getting 8 hours of sleep is actually pretty impossible then" "Woops" "Woopsie"
Hi there hello, you made a typo *Brians are Jerks at 3AM There ya go
Ryan, I'm afriad were going to need several videos dedicated to the 3am brain topic.
The first time a Ryan got scarred by the idea of another Ryan in the room
Didn't know this could be TOO relatable...ouch.
When you’re popular enough that other channel try to use commenting on your videos as advertisements for their channels
My brain be like: "Hey, remember that time you were a jerk to that person when you were a kid?" "Why did you did that?" "You are a horrible human being".
One of the best ever, and that's saying a lot
, . ,
This is a REALLY good one. It’s a person!! 😂  so truuuue. Glad I’m not the only one
Was waiting for the last joke to actually be a killer
Even his brain looks like him in this universe 😂
New type of video... awesome!
hey, that was me this past night. I also didnt go for that jog. I always jump of joy when I see there is a video of you, thanks Ryan George
So good Ryan... Love the haircut too
My brain at 3 am: what if we are already dead and what we think we are living is just our memories
The bit about high school...so true
This could easily be whole new series, more of brain!
My Adhd brain is like that brain on crack
This is kind of sus
Ah yes, sleep paralyses and night terrors, lovely times. Don't eat spicy food or cheese before bedtimes boys and girls.
Thank you. This has really convinced me to get a lobotomy.
You can tell Ryan's a cat person.  Dog people know if there was a person our pups would go crazy, while cats would just ask if the killer could maybe change his litterbox after murdering us.
hi
This is so relatable cause the exact thing happened to me on wednesday
This is the most relatable video I’ve seen in awhile, except I usually wake up at 2:00 AM not 3:00 AM
This is why I smoke myself to sleep 😂
he missed out if my brain turned into another person ide just beat it if it started saying stuff like that.
Too relatable. Man, I am going to cry. This is happening to me since covid started and is not allowing me get a good sleep for over year know!. Thanks, seeing this has made me feel a bit better that I am not alone .😔☹😭
👀👀"Do you remember that?"
I hope this is reoccurring, too relatable for a one-off.
I have to get up at 3am every day, so my brain has to be a jerk at irregular intervals throughout the day instead.
Brain: Alright time to go to sle- hey remember that essay that is due tomorrow that you completely forgot about?
That embarrassing moment he said was oddly specific.
My brain at 3am : I've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty..
Literally me every night 😂😂😂😂
You are awsome
I legitimately feel bad for people who dont watch this guy because they dont like YouTube.
Truth Hurts 🤕
How about the first guy to tell a joke.
seems like an obvious bit for some sheets and giggles product placement.
TIL Ryan George has a tattoo under his arm
Let's make this man prime supervisor of mankind
I so relate to this video 😹
Did you just pull a "sheeeesh" on us??
Ryan has tattoos!
Evolution is a bitch
I do this some times... but when I do it there's literally a co-conscious alter I'm actually talking to... and it doesn't have to be 3 am...
How isn't name of this video: "first guy to ever find out brains are jerks"
I hate myself cuz of how relatable this is 🥲
Ah, yes, the hour of the wolf.
0:30 This is pretty good timing since I met my sleep paralysis demon for the first time the other night...
Ironically watching this at 3am
Me Trying to Sleep: Okay, good night ph-... Phone: Oh, hey, it's that person on the youtube with the funny videos you subscribed to, you should check it out! Ryan: Oh, hey, you know how your brain hates you and sleep? Here's a video showing how your brain messes with you when you try to sleep! Me: Welp....at least I'm doing my part to help Ryan feed his kitty cats....I'm not sleeping am I? Brain: Nope! Hey, you should watch more videos so Ryan can buy his kitties wet food! Me: Welp....I guess so.
Me: *Trying to sleep at 3AM*  My brain: "Hi there, hello."
My brain right now: you can hit the dislike button and feel important because you see the number change...or you can be part of the 31k and feel insignificant 🤔  ...aahh who am I kidding, I love ya Ryman
Except when it comes to the taste of water.
this man looks like mrbeast
Do a “first person to get a job” video or a “first person to have a sibling” video
It's like...   relatable humor
The most accurate thing Ryan George has ever made
Funniest video 😆 can relate to the jogging part 😂😂🤣
I was the football player who didnt make a funny joke lmao its a 50 50 chance so i just make jokes all the timr to try and fix that lmao
That one guy in high school might not have laughed... but who's laughing now?
You've met my brain. Only it's let's watch a couple of pitch meetings before going back to sleep. Next morning: jog? Nah.
Brilliant
This is so accurate. Especially that lingering feeling that someone is observing us late at night but it's just some innocuous figure 😂😂
Kudos, this one was actually good :3
Please do the First guy to ever go to hell
That last bit 🤣🤣🤣
Me: I'm going to sleep. So, I am gonna need u to get all the way of my back about stupid things I did 30 years ago. All right brain? My brain: yeah, sure, all you have to do is to switch the light off and I'll begin my night shift. Agree?!
ON. POINT.
This skit was really good
Bro your a genius I really like you keep on going
Me every night. My wife doesn’t get it. She tells me getting to sleep is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
i remember them allllllllll
Well... to be fair to the brain; before we invented those rectangles that keep undesired people and/or animals out of our homes; there used to be a high chance that there WAS something there to kill you at night, so the brain is just like: "better safe than sorry"
Brain George
My brain at 3 in the morning: Look buddy I know you would like to rest and all that but what about let’s not do that and make you look like a fool when you snore in class
The brain is the creator and destroyer of motivation
My brain: Let's me fall asleep, then proceeds to create the most elaborate, lengthy, 2012 style disaster scenario for me to live out while I sleep, then I wake up panicking, thinking it actually happened.
I like stories, so my brain comes up with all sorts of strange stories and tells them to me while I'm sleeping.  Sometimes my brain even scares the poo out of me with its stories and then I'm afraid to go back to sleep.
Omg..😂😂😂
I wonder if he actually wrote this stuff down when he went to sleep and these are his actual thoughts
Shadow people encounter
Even though you pretty much know what jokes he's gonna make by the title, they're all still hilarious
My brain at 3 AM: Trade Offer I receive a boost of adrenaline you receive not being able to sleep
Wait, what happened to the adstronaut ?
Amazing
Love this so much! You guys never fail to make me laugh!
Ya love to see it 🙃
The 3am trip to the bathroom
My brain loves to remind me of deeply embarrassing experiences I had days,weeks,months or years or over a decade ago at the worst possible hour of the night / following morning.
so true
I’m just speculating here but we are certainly dying right now.
Where's the Adstronaut?!
That got scary real fast 😂
Brain: remember that time you decided to tell your crush that you had a crush on her by writing it on a piece of paper and dropping it into her bag but she noticed and you reacted very weirdly.  Me: **Dies inside**
😍😍😍😍😍
Even coats and jackets look like Ryan George in the Ryan George universe
I expected a "Oh my god, are we falling???" joke
Wait until the bladder joins in on the fun
Genius 🤣😂
we need a series about the brain now
I know that guy, but he looks like me.
Ryan's videos honestly make my day!
I love you, Ryan.  If we ever meet, I'm going to be the creepy fan who asks for a selfie with you, but then comes back 20 seconds later because I didn't like the way I looked in the first selfie.  :D
Mine would be louder and more panicked. I have constructed traps to trip intruders or alert me of intruders at 3am before and then had to dismantle them to leave my room for school. I have also had the fear of someone getting in the room but hiding out of sight just over the edge of the bed. Can't stick your arm out to turn on the light...
Melatonin is TIGHT
your the best bro
It's currently 3am for me right now. So, that's good.
Does your brain just ever go like we're dying like you don't feel sick or tired or in pain but your brain convinced itself you are dying
I bet the bad joke incident actually happened.  You  got the last laugh in the end.
Going for a jog in the morning is very easy, barely an inconveniance
LMFAO THE LAST BIT IS WAYYYY TOO RELATABLE. like criminally relatable
Fan at 3am: ~Shuts off suddenly due to power saving technology~ Also me at 3am: OMG the power was just cut, someone is coming to kill me.
The thing about the morning jog is, if you want it to be energizing, if you want a clear head for the day after it, you need to go alone and leave Brain Ryan (I call him Bryan) back at home.
“Yeah, were not doing that.” “I know.”  😁😁😆😆😆🤣🤣
The other night I couldn’t sleep because my brain thought that it was just WILD and CRAZY that EVERY person in the world needs to breathe AIR to survive. Like what the hell is that? The only reason every person - and honestly 99% of like all the things - is alive is because of air. Like how weird is it that things have to breathe in order to survive? And then like what would have happened if humans didn’t have noses? Would we just breathe out of our mouth forever? Our mouths would be so very dry and it’d be so much less convenient than if we just had a nose. And then what about animal noses? Those things are so cute sometimes. Like a dog nose? That’s cute... piggies? Omg adorable...  By the way I was totally sober for all of this... ._. I dunno what the hell my brain was doing that day.
Part 2 now
What is your tattoo say?
Ok, I got two for ya...  First Guy to Ever Call EMS, and The First Guy To Be A Paramedic.
The tremble in his voice after he figured out was a jacket was perfect LMFAO
This might be your best video yet.
My brain at 3 AM: Remember that plot hole in your script that doesn't make any sense? Me: Yeah, I'm going to need you to get all the way off my back about that!
😂 so accurate. I wonder what kind of attitude  Meditation would be like.
So the sound it played at 3:00 AM (0:11) is definitely the first note of gangsta's paradise, right?
I’m seeing it on 3:00 am and that ghost thing just fucked me up now 😭😭😭
LOL, so accurate.
Like, you should sleep man... Not joking, you got something really important tomorrow.... Come on, GO TO SLEEP! Why aren’t you sleeping? God, you are so unambitious...  Oh, good morning! Ready to take on the day?
[x] I'm in this photo and I don't like it.
I always wake about about 3am, now I know why I cant get to sleep again !
Man fuck that was so spot on
wow i just this happen last night neat
This is me merely trying to get to sleep, minus the 'killer attacks' hallucination. >.>
My brain when I’m trying to go to sleep. Tomorrow I’m going to do this this and this and it’s very important. My brain in the morning what did I say???
this is too relatable help, the jog thing i do too much too
true
I thought i was the one who thought of death at night
How do you come up with all these original sketches? It's very impressive!
Amazing video man! I am guessing this happened to you recently?  😅
The brain also likes to leave the good/explaining things out…
This my life
HAHAHA that shot of adrenaline
LMAO This is genius and 💯 accurate 😂😂 Random thoughts and whatnot
Sooooo f**kin true...
1:20 oh my God that’s exactly what happens to me almost every single night
bad choice watching this @3am haha
Haha verified comments go brr
Brain at 3am: Remember that time when you had a coughing fit in class so bad that you threw up?  Everyone will remember that, and never forget.  Me: 😮
You're in bed at 3am, quite unrelatable.
This is literally my brain. My whole life. Lmao 😂🤣
This is to relatable. It isn't even funny, it's just depressing
This is the most relatable video Ryan has ever made.
How did you know what goes on in my brain!?
Well, technically we all are dying right now little by little every moment that passes. No joke or meme just a reminder of our finite fragile existence.... Goodnight.
Napoleon famously spoke of two o'clock in the morning courage.
I know we need to sleep already but this thing that happened during the day, remember that you said this in response, what if you had said this other thing instead, it would have been so cool, everyone would have given you a freaking standing ovation, what a missed opportunity my man, you could have been the freaking hero.
Why is it alway s 3am? *mutters*
"are we dying right now? i don't want to speculate so ill just assume that we are."
that fcking scared the sht out of me 0:33
My brain at 3 AM: Hi there, hello! You need to pee and you haven't eaten in 6 hours or so, so you you should get up and take care of that. Also, I have this really great idea that is super complex and you think about that for several hours in great detail.
0:51  After the ‘my heart is racing’ it would be the perfect time to add you with a heart photo on ur shirt running on a race track while screaming.
Can we get a montage of Ryan saying "tomorrow" plz?
Bruh it is 3 AM rn and I read the title as "Brian jerks at 3 AM"
you don't need that jog, the brain gets your blood pumping at 3am.
Whe... Where's the adstronaut? The.. there was no adstronaut! What do I do?! This hasn't happened before! Do I just stop watching? Without any sponcer? Are you crazy?! I.. I know.. I'll go watch a sponcer from a different video, surely that's good
7am Time for the run, then again! New Years Morning, alright time for that run, then again!
People with pets: "I sense a disturbance in the house..... Should I check on it or sleep?..."  Brain: "They probably broke the lock under the sink and are drinking chemicals or chewing on cords you didn't hide well enough!.. But I guess you never really loved them... So stay in bed you lazy pos."  Looks all over the house: "Awe! Look at them being so sweet and asleep"   Pets: "Hello father..... Time to play a game?"  Brain: *maniacally laughs in the background*
Wait a minute, guys, who is he talking to?
Me, the past two nights
Yep.
1:27 Ah yes, perfection 😂 You could've ended the sketch on "We're not doing that." But the "I know." Makes it 100x better 😂
I’ve never before been disappointed that there wasn’t an ad
Lololo
Why did you have the same night as I did Ryan
Me last night… 😞
Haa! This could have gone on for an hour and i woulda watched it. 👍  Ok, so an Hour Is a bit long but still, i could Definitely watch alot of this😆
Will be watching this again at 3 am.
I read the title as Brian’s are annoying at 3am
It's time to make a video on morning routine 😁
I want more of that
Why can I only like these ONCE???
Hi
lls you be think the dumb shit and sad shit in your life and be question everything
Person:I hope my brain at least struggles to think of a way to ruin my life  Brain:                                                                                                                                      It was super easy hardly a inconvenience                                                                                            ;)                                                                                                             Lol just go away                                                                                                                  Ya it was a mistake clicking “read more”                                                                                                                                                  Ok I’ll stop lol
that horror moment is so fucking true lol, i once thought there was someone sitting on chair looking at me, i turn on lights and find out it was the pile of clothes i put together.
Short and sweet, I love it.
The first person to ever invented sports?
Here's some engagement for one of my favorite YouTubers!
Why are all the top comments generic complements of unoriginal jokes, all from verified YouTubers. Can't a regular person have a normal comment section anymore?
I guess we should go for that jog.... Yea we're not doing that. Too real.
*Ryan's brain casually having an existential crisis at 3am in the morning*
Huh- seeing this at 3PM, darn 12 hours off
This would be a great mini series LMAO that just grows and grows
My CPTSD: 'Aight, I'm gonna give you a shot of adrenaline and cortisol.'  Me: 'Why?'  CPTSD: 'You'll figure it out in five hours or you won't. Have a nice attack, buddy. It's like a riddle. Have fun!'  Me: 'Oh no no no please no oh.... Ok.'  Five Hours Later: 'So yeah, after thorough analysis, the findings indicate that... You're *not* the worst. Excellent news!'
I had to pause the video so that I could laugh loud and hard for like a whole minute at the reminiscing about the High School joke fail. My husband (who is also a Ryan G, BTW) is also a funny guy, and will also tell jokes twice if no one laughs the first time. A few years ago I famously said, “Just because no one laughed, doesn’t mean no one heard you” and it has become one of our family phrases. Too funny that the same thing happened to you!
Did that highschool story really happen to you?
Confronting your sleep paralysis demon be like:   https://youtu.be/9X5oEboYEKg
That's your sleep paralysis demon oh no it's your coat hanger.
1:07 I never knew that Ryan had a tattoo(s). Wow, wow, wow.
Relatable 1 0 0
Hi there hello.  It's the Regretstronaut here...  Oh, were you thinking of sleeping now?  On those rough sheets? Are you hot, cold, or uncomfortable in any way?  Yeah, it's your crappy sheets. Let's order better sheets tomorrow. Or maybe now.  No, sleep now.  Buy sheets tomorrow.  Or now...
"I guess we should do X."-me "Yeah we're not doing that."-my brain with X being anything even slightly inconvenient
I'm watching this at 3 AM. Thanks brain. Now I see a person.
Brains might be jerks, but B-Ryan is the best
at the time of writing this comment, its 3:33 am
Please do the first ever charity.
My brain at 3 am: You should go to sleep, my guy. Me: Nah...
Yes, but, have you ever talked to your liver?
It is legitimately comforting to know that everyone's brain does that to them.
This is the best video ever 😂😂😂😂😂
At 3 Am is your brain a big Jerk if you are in the forest after you heard a John Sinclair epesode and evrybody is sleeping exept you because SOMBODY was thinking this was a great idea.
My brain mentions exercising Me : WHY DID U SAY THAT NAME?!
0:12 The funny thing is that he released this video at the same time I was watching "The exorcism of Emely Rose", in which these 3am scenes is a major element of the plot.
Ok i mistook the title😆
It is good to see that the redness from your eyes are gone!
I personally have way more problems with Mr. Heart  If you know what I mean
This highschool remembrance hit close. And every other afterwards
Lol
... this was posted at ~3am my time, thats kind of creepy
My brain is making me watch this at 5am
Me: I'm so tired tonight that my brain  may actually have a real hard time keeping me awake. 🧠 Actually it will be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Man I love your vids
From what I'm learning from this video AND comment section, I'm not the only person here with anxiety, insomnia and dyslexia...That actually worries me a little...
My life rn
The way it starts by pretending we're getting up for a jog, I feel personally attacked.
If I go to sleep NOW I have 8 hours till alarm rings...  If I go to sleep NOW I have 6 hours till alarm rings...  If I go to sleep NOW I have 3 hours till alarm rings...  Alarm will ring in one hour, might as well just get up...
1:10 This is way too specific to be just a joke I'd guess.
Why is this so accurate
me every morning 😅🤣🤣
It's going to be really difficult to fall asleep now. Don't worry about it, it will be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Exact same feeling on the jog and morning
Am I the only one who saw the spider?
Nailed it
You *are* your brain.
3 am actually is a special time
There more of these I see the more I'm convinced we live in a simulation...
It's so true. I thought someone was walking into my room and watching me sleep so I was unconsciously trying to decide whether to fully wake up or not. Then I just let go and went fully to sleep. Woke up and just remembered it. God I hate dreams/nightmares. Wish i could just go to sleep and it be quiet cold (i sleep with a fan) dark until I wake up
This video is clearly above average, even for this channel.
Exactly me at 230, 245, 250, 420, 510, 530 and 621. Thinking about locking myself in a bank safe so I can sleep better.
I read that as "Brian's are jerks at 3am"   This makes much more sense now
My brain at 3am: phone.
So help me brain, one of these days...     Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon!
so this video just had to upload at 3am in my area
💛
I need more of that tattoo...
So... for some reason youtube will let me watch any video, except this one.. this one never charges, any other video does in milliseconds.. this is freaking weird.. ill never know why brains are jerks at 3 am :(
Welp my sleep paralysis just got worse
so true
7:00am......good god that feeling...biggest of ambitions, squandered by 10 more mins
He must have woken up at the end of a 90-minute sleep cycle at 3am. Classic mistake.
Once again, RG pisses me off with his genius
Now add sleep paralysis to that 3am moment and you get several minutes of pure psychological torture that scars you for life over nothing. Speaking from experience here.
the past month ive been waking up 2 to 4 am and it takes me 1 hour to fall asleep and this is what happens EVERY flippin time
My brain at 3AM:  Do donkeys have nipples?
first person to go for a walk (everyone is confused because there is no purpose)
Lol been a while since I laughed so hard thought I was getting bored of his vids but apparently Im not
Night mares
Amazing!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂 Brilliant
I was fast asleep, suddenly something happened and I woke up. And now I'm Binge watching Trigonometry lectures. (it's 00:30 here) Funny How brain works.
My schizophrenia at 3 a.m.:  your a loser  it's spelled you're  only a loser would correct that
Our brains are jerks at three am, because that's when all our inner demons wake up.
So you got a bad dream/thought for me?  My brain : Yes sir, I do.
*about to fall asleep*  Brain @3AM: Hey did you notice that tattoo on Ryan George's arm? Me: No. Maybe, why? Brain: Don't worry, you'll never know what it says. Go back to bed. Me: o_O
Your content is so unique and I love it  I'M SUPER GRATEFUL FOR CLICKING ON ONE OF YOUR VIDEOS ACCIDENTLY , IT IS SOMETHING I'LL NEVER REGRET!!
My brain at 3 am : Are u sure u locked the door?
Me: *sees a pillow in the dark* My brain: *It's a horrifying ungodly demon of the Netherworld.*
I am watching it at 3:10 A.M.
My body @ 3AM: "Dude, our left arm is numb. Are you sure we're not having a heart attack?" *adrenaline*
Me who live in Puerto Rico. My brain at 3:00 AM: EARTHQUAKE!!!.
This is so true that it's almost frightening
Are we dying right now? Yeah we definitely are. Me literally the night before last💀
If you think that's bad, wait till you see what JayStation's brain is like at 3AM
"Remember that event in your life 10 year ago?  Well the best response you should have said right then and there was...."   also "IT'S OK, JUST GO BACK TO SLEEP! JJJUUUSSTTT GGOOOO BBBAACCKKK TOOOOO SLEEP!!!!"
No joke - drinking coffee and caffeinated drinks do that to you.
since death by old age is a thing that means that we are all dying from the very moment we get born
You missed brain saying: "Well if you sleep now, you'll still get 3 hours... if you sleep now you'll still get 2 hours... sleep now and 1 hour should be enough. Better get up actually, you don't want to sleep through your alarm... OK, we actually are going to get up cause your alarm goes off in 15 minutes? Alright, well we're definitely tired now, time to sleep, night!"
Wow it's almost 3am here when this was uploaded and thanks for giving my brain ideas
Watching this at exactly 3am hits different for some reason.
gfd
I was thinking, "Man, Ryan is a content Machine!" and then it hit me"Oh, right, Clones." Speaking of which, was the tattoo on the inside of the one in bed's arm his clone number?
Lol should this be this relatable
This might bE my favorite Ryan George video ever
I feel like this was Ryan's morning after a night out and just became a sketch....like every other video. Brilliant!
Hey, so we know that zombies aren't real but there is ABSOLUTELY A ZOMBIE UPSTAIRS and it's gonna eat us!
I genuinely cannot understand how you come up with these sketches   GAWD LEVEL creativity   You always put a smile on my face   Thank you
Your brains logic: its night time. There is a silhouette of something that looks like a person. Its an evil killer.
The twice said joke hurt in a very personal place
Brian is such a jerk at 3am
you wrote this sketch at 3am didn't you? With something important in the morning?
0:49 he sounded so scared, good job
I have never related to a video more
Sure but to add an extra level of sleep deprivation just add young kids into the mix.
My brain doesn’t do that. Instead, it plays out arguments in the defense of Legend of Korra when I’m trying to fall asleep at 10:00.
My brain is usually pretty kind to me. Not much for churning up old unpleasant memories. When it's time to keep me up it's just, you know, constant reminders of how little I've slept and maybe if I fall asleep RIGHT NOW I can still get x amount of sleep. Like a helpful countdown until the alarm goes off.
true
I haven't watched yet, but I already 1000% relate
I'm watching this at 2am
😂 never stop
If you were Jewish, you would have so many "first guy to..." ideas.
My brain is acting weird at 3 am, Thanks a lot Bernie Sanders 😤😜
I love the wake-up at 3am " the witching hour" thing. 😂 For those that don't know, it's said that 3 am is when spirits are most active.
When you get a notification that Ryan published another video you have a guarantee laugh.
This Shadow demon is tight.
Me watching this at 3 am: interesting...
Good 1... Thank God my brains under MY control
all this time i thought i was talkin to my dad but guess it was my brain
Oh god this is me...
Yooooo
SO TRUE!!
🤣😂🤣😂
1000/1 Like/Dislike Ratio. That is something I thought our world was incapable of doing but man with Ryan George anything is possible. No better person to deserve such an incredible feat. Keep it up man. We love the content! (Currently 21000 like to 21 dislikes, I dare anyone to find me a video with a better ration than that. Also im sure 1 in every 1000 person accidently hit dislike instead of like so this is flawless by Ryan)
When anxiety hit you hard
Do you remember that?....   DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?! 😐 🤣
Brains are always jerks
I looooooooved iiiit !!! 💕❤❤💕🥰
The person in the corner thing literally happened to me 2 nights ago. I knew it was clothes hanging on the closet door, but the brain was having none of it.
You do awesome work, you can really see all the hard work put into each release. Thank you for all the amazing content.
ShittyLifeTip: Alcohol keeps your brain occupied.
So true. XD
That thumbnail was supposed to reference Bo Burnham Inside right?  I’m getting the same vibes
I thought the title was about how guys named “Brian” are pretty mean, specifically at 3 am.
I should be working but instead I’m binge watching Ryan George videos. Thanks brain.
Has Ryan been stalking me?
God why is this so accurate-
Me. Nightly.
Was woken up randomly at 3 a few days ago and I asked "can we just go back to sleep maybe?" so many times. But brain won. Had to turn on the light.
Literally me last night. And the night before that. And every night I’ve ever had.
Gonna be thinking about this at 3AM
That little bit of emotion when Ryan got scared of the jacket... Ngl, because emotions in his voice are so rare in his videos, it was super impactfull.
The 21 dislikes are from brains at 3am
On point.
Video Idea: First guy to have emotions
that was awsome... that voice and relaxation when he realised it's just a jacket.. killed it..
I don't know how you come up with these concepts, but they are so good!
My brain at 3 am: Watch out! The giant marshmallows are gonna kill you!  Use your jetpack that you didn't have 5 seconds ago to get away!
👍👍👍👍
How did Ryan talk to his brain if his brain is outside him 🤔
my brain at 3 AM: Hey, want to clean the whole house? 'Cause I do.
This is SOOOOOOO TRUE Last night i was rethinking my life and thinking everyone was gonna die someday       Wtf
my brain: thats a nice dream it would be a shame if.... I do the falling thing :)
Brain: Hey! Remember that song you like? Me: Must sleep... Brain: Let's go over the song. Maybe even, just a few lines. Repeatedly. For hours.
I'm in this video and I dont like it.
This was definitely one of your best ones. Top five, for sure. I'm sure I'll be thinking of where this falls in that list at 4am.
Love the way he says "it's a jacket"
TIL the funniest man on the internet has a tricep tattoo.
Too accurate
Speaking of saying things twice...I said to my girlfriend a couple days ago... Damn, you've got a big (bleep) Damn, you've got a big (bleep)  And she said, why did you say that twice?  And I said, I didn't, it was the echo 😄
That  -We are not doing that -I know  just killed me
"Isn't that right brain?" "I can't see your brain!"
I hate this so much. It’s too real.
I'm from Taiwan, it's 3：00am now.Nice work.
For those with sleep paralysis,  my brain be like:  "Yeah sorry I need make sure you can't move or speak for a minute, don't worry it will pass in a minute or so." 😅 😅 😅 😅
Do: "the first guy to ever say a fake name in starbucks"
129407th
This is a symbiote Bcz it says “we”
What? Nothing from the Adstronaut?
Can confirm.
I'm sure Ryan wrote this entire sketch in his head while trying to sleep at 3 AM.
Uhhhh... When the lights were off it kind of looked like the "jacket" was moving...
Where's the ad????? A video without the adstronaut just feels... incomplete.
Also my brain at 3am:  You should sleep, you have to work in the morning.  If you can't sleep, you could do your job poorly and get fired.  Might even die in a car crash on the way in.
other's brain at 3am: everything is consumed by the great and all knowing void that is the passage of time and the entropy of the universe my brain in a nutshell: hey what if your crush were in this situation listen you have to create dialogues now i decided
The "high school joke" thing was oddly specific... Are you ok Ryan?
me at 3am: 😴
Not being able to sleep because your brain thinks of stuff is tight!
Rational brain: "The likelihood that something is amiss is extremely low." Lizard brain: "That is either mice or ghosts or both."
currently watching this at 3:46AM , my brain is telling me to binge watch your old videos and pitch meetings
"So you have a painful memory for me?" "Yes sir I do"
Well this is a scandal. Apparently my brain has been seeing other people!
My brain @ 3:00 am: The world will collapse tomorrow if you don't scroll ur mobile!
It’s 4am for me, as soon as 3 passed my brain started complimenting me.
Is that a coincidence in India this video come out 11:30 pm.
This  couldn't be more true genuinely, its always 3am isn't it lmao, and the coat hanger is sooo good, cause I have this black hat on top of a white t shirt hanging up, and it looks like a ghost everttime I see it with the corner of my eye hahaha so relatable bro
People who are on a device 18 hours a day.  In bed...I HAVE A BRAIN! And its talking to me...what do I do??
This sort of thing used to happen to me, but then I got a cat, so she has taken on the duty of sleep interrupter, lol.
Ryan, blink twice if that jock story really happened.
😂😂😂👍
My brain at 3AM: Your pillow is soggy bread now and 200 degrees.
this time before bed i took some sleeping medicine, i'm a very heavy sleeper for normal stuff, but abnormal sounds will wake me regardless of how quiet they are. i live on the third floor. I heard a noise at 2am, was alone so it wasnt my family. got a gun went down stairs slowly with a flashlight. Cleared the house, no idea what made the noise... Went back up unloaded the pistol, set it back on the night stand, checked my phone 2:15. i got back in bed...(third floor) i wake up startled. i am laying on the couch on the first floor covered in a sheet holding a rifle. Confused, i start looking around...All 4 of my cats are standing in the same doorway starting at me..."what the..." * i blink * they gone... I clear the house again, check the locks, etc. The cats were each sleeping in different bedrooms... i go back down and lay down on the couch since it was really comfy. I sit down and set my phone down on the side table. I look at the doorway as im laying down, One of the cats is sticking its head around the corner. I blink before i register the cat is creeping on me..."God Da...." I open my eyes, I am not on the living room couch...I'm in my bed on the third floor...9am  Here's the kicker, we have a couple cameras inside the house pointing different directions. I did not leave my room from the time i went to bed until i woke up 9am. there was no movement in the house the entire night... I have not taken any sleeping medicine since...I do not like weird dreams like that...
Brain: Hey are you up?   Also Brain: Now let's obsess over all the time you're missing out on sleep and how much you're gonna dread it in the morning.
That jock and those other people... well, nowadays this channel and Pitch Meetings are quite popular. You got your revenge, Ryan. (also... brains at 3AM are jerks in dreams sometimes, too)
My brain is worse than this. I am so paranoid I keep a knife on my night stand now.
The end got me unexpectedly...
god I've never felt more seen.
Here's a fun story: This talking cow was trying to eat me!  So I lured him into an ambush, and punched him right square between the eyes, and woke up with a broken finger from punching an iron bedpost.
So then he did a backflip,snapped the -bad guy’s- coat hangers’ neck, and saved the day
Quality content right here.
When this happens at night,it's time to introduce jerk brains to sleeping pills.
I regularly threaten my brain that if it makes me so one more stupid thing I'll find a wire hanger and get egyptian on its grey matter.
This reminds me: Hi people of the internet! Can you give me a hand? I'm trying to line up some philosophy/psychology/neuroscience stuff to read where the main focus is on being our own worst enemy. I'm looking for suggestions of stuff ranging from ancient to fairly modern (I must admit I am completely ignorant to most modern texts/persons).  I am looking for both cliffsnotes-style resources as well as lengthier texts. So, both names of authors/practitioners/leaders/etc. and/or names of pieces of work - ranging from mere articles to essays to books to volumes.  I've been struggljng against myself as this video portrays all too often as of late, and it's definitely inspired me to get back into reading more about these incredible features of us wild creatures of the Earth ;)  Thanks in advance dear reader! I hope I didn't put a damper on your YouTube browsing - especially Ryan's energies... the lad's a genius and an international treasure!  If you read this Ryan: you're awesome and deserve much praise for your wonderfully entertaining natural talent in these classic short skits! Kudos my man, kudos!
Jeez is scary how relatable you are
You have just murdered me
This is pretty relatable
The pink face though
Next skit shower thoughts
Love knowing it ain’t just me
i'm in this video and i don't like it LMAO sero=iously tho, i was getting second hand cringe because of how relatable this is
Absolutely love this 🥺😂🥰❤👏🏽👏🏽
7AM is the most relatable part.
This is so real!!!! You just described my brain perfectly!!!! Brilliant!!! You are the best!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
its been years since i last seen that shadowy coat person at night. I miss seeing those :v
Oh thank god it's not just me!
It's only at exactly st 3:00am
Hi Mr. Ryan, I subscribed and did something like that actually happen to you and you decided to make a sketch about it?
dont forget the "hey did you know that you breathe automatically until somebody mentions it... crazy right!"
Weird. I thought all youtubers got spooky phone calls at 3am and got visited by the spooky phonecallers.
😂😂😂
Kinda sucks when they remind you about your passed mistakes
3:00am is the mocking hour, its not your brain.
Is it me Or did anyone misread the title as "Brian j***s at 3 am" at first glance? I'm not joking...
noice
meanwhile my brain at 3 am plays gangstas paradise on repeat
Everybody, read the description! I beg of you. For the sake of Ryan's cats.
Yes, indeed they are
He forgot the part where the tv makes weird sounds and you think it’s someone breaking in
Ryan George, you sir, are an American treasure. 🇺🇸👑
"Why did we say we were going to go for a jog?" "I don't know!" "Fair enough."
This is why it's important to come to terms with your own mortality and the mortality of those you care about ahead of time. Why my brain hits me with that line at 3AM I just reply "Yup." and keep falling asleep.
Why don't you have 10M subs yet 😭😭😭😭
Yep. 100% accurate.
I feel personally attacked in this video
No hot hot cold cold hot cold hot feet feet pee no hungry RA RA RASPUTIN.
Another quality skit.
My brain is the opposite, is like: me: "well, I think we should talk about what we solve that problem"  brain: "Yeah, but we can do this tomorrow. So ~system shutting down~"  me: "Wait.." ~sleppes so heavy not even a rainstorm would make me wake up~
So true it's literally happened to me!
The coat thing happened to me last night and it was 3:10 am. ;) But I reminded myself that was where I actually put the coats ;P and I didn't even need to turn the lights on...this time.
1000/10  Ryan is a legend!
I'm in this video and I don't like it.
Brain: So I need you to stay awake as long as you can. Myself: But that's going to be very difficult. Brain: Actually is going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Yup
Do you have a sleep to ruin? Yes sir I do! I am me and I won't harm myself so it's gonna be difficult? No actually super easy, barely and inconvenience... Oh really? Yeah... Remember the time when_______
I'm Weak 😂😂😂
Brain at 3AM: Let's go back to sleep now. You still have plenty of hours! Brain at 4 AM: Don't worry, you still have time. Sleep will come sooner or later. Brain at 5AM:You have at most 2h of sleep now. Just saying. Brain at 6AM: 59 minutes. You better relax and fall asleep! 58! 57! 56!
This is a good one, nice job Ryan
The first person to tell a scary story
https://youtube.com/channel/UCOaZoKfFrIQfz4bbtRZerDA
Ryan: *uploads* Youtube: *doesn't notify me* Me: 🙍‍♂️
💜
All I want is "The first guy to ever be an ad-stronaut", please make it happen....
It's comforting to know I'm not the only insane person in the world.
Im watching this at 3 am
I know it’s a relatable comedy bit, but... why Do brains do this? Specifically the 3 am part
Literally watching this at 3am 🥲
This just happened to me last night
Oh. My. God. Its not just me!
I feel like 1:11 actually happened to him lol.
this is literally me every night
First guy to play football please!!!
Bit idea: what if cable was created after streaming services
the only thing missing is my brain suggesting that in the morning we should have a cracking headache
This is exactly me (exept the "everybody you know is gonna die someday". Thats reverse)
This is so hilariously real
First guy to play football please!!!
Not getting anything done in the morning is tight!
The usual
This was me last night that’s also why I woke up at 1:30pm
Wait a minute. Was it a jacket or a coat?
Your on fire Ryan!!! Here we come 2 million 😊
so close my brain at 3 am tells me i have work in 4 hours. you should be up NOW  for the day.
Great video again sir!
I’m awake at 3am watching this and this is definitely what’s going though my mind right now
This is funny, but if you wanted to be HILARIOUS you could have posted it at 3 am.
I've never related more 🤣🤣
Why do our brains conspire against us?
So in the Ryanverse, Ryans have brains that are also Ryans and can manifest physically into the Ryanverse looking like Ryan...
Me: alright time for bed. Brain: Let's spend the next 4 hours reliving hurtful moments from the past and rehearsing scenarios that would never happen.
Its 230 here aha my brain is early
As someone who lives with anxiety and paranoia this is basically every night
Brain: Ok wakeup! Me: WHY Brain: Because Me: That works
...need a wee, need a wee, need a wee....
4:30am this is me currently
Ryan has a beard now!
Is that coat your jacket?
This bit easily could have been a 10 minute video
this is my brain whenever im in the dark "i hear a voice" "i see a person"
A bunch of video ideas most of them are garbage. First guy to go to court First guy to gamble First guy to pitch a movie First guy to do an election First guy to open a water/amusement park First guy to ever do a race First guy to have a pet First guy to make a religion
Brain: "Hey, just wanted to remind you how old you are and how little you've accomplished in life." Me: "...I guess we're doing this now."
more stuff with brain character please
Damnit man I was at work when this dropped! Awesome way to start my weekend 🤘🏾
I thought this said “Brians” and I was just like, “yeah ok, I’ll watch it”
“You kinda have to pee but not really.”
It was 3:00 pm when u posted this (in military time)
I'm watching this at 3am right now in Korea
anyone else think 'brain' looks like mad sweeney from american gods?
It’s like my brain wants to piss me off whenever I try to sleep by bring up memories that I hate
Heart: seriously dude! I'm tired of you making me working at full power at 3am
Me walking alone outside and hearing somebody, but no one is there
By far one of the most relatable videos you have ever made thx for the laughs man keep doing what you doing
This feels visceral
I do not like how your brain stole all my thoughts.
Ryan George’s voice crack of fear: 0:49 Didn’t know I needed it Can no longer live without it
I agree man, you see its currently 2am, but suddenly you upload a video...    my brain is telling me to sleep, what a jerk lol     ok i need to sleep tho
Good one!
It was actually 3am where I am when you uploaded this
Yeah that never happens to me … <cough>
My brain at 3am: "one more YouTube video, then we're totally going to sleep."
I am in this video and I don't like that.
Anyone else notice that the door was closed when he went to sleep, and at 3 am it was open
This reminds me of Daniel thrasher
This is so accurate.
Dang dude this is one of your best videos ever!
😅 This is my life !!!
Brain : good morning! Me : wha..  Brain : it's 6.30 time to wake up! Me : no, it's the weekend Brain : the what Me : weekend. We get to sleep long on the weekends, remember? Brain : no, we've been getting up at 6.30 for the past 5 days. Me : because those were the workdays. Brain : hm okay. Wanna try falling asleep again? Me : yeah sure. *5 seconds later* Brain : welp that was a fail, get up!
I literally didn't sleep a single minute last night due to this very reason. Ryan is a physic. He had to know.
Brain: hey, remember that one time where you were super awkward and cringy? You forgot all of that? Well, glad I reminded you! Does this also mean you're going to die alone? Anyway, good night!  Me: T.T  Brain: if poisons expire, do they become more or less poisonous?  Me: *proceeds to Google the question and thus making me stay up even longer*
My brain at 3 am: Hey remember that time when you were a kid ten years ago, you called a man fat out in public and he left the scene immediately.
Get out of my head!! Just kidding. You can stay.
So damn true
This is sooo me 🤣🤣🤣
I'm no where close to a scientist. But mine woke me up to teach my chemistry calculation and formulas. Literally 🤣
I don't ever think I've laughed as hard and as long on his videos! Haha pure gold! Take my like you scoundrel
Jokes on you, I might as well be a corpse, when I sleep and I don’t have any dreams.
That was horribly accurate.  I don't like that at all - Get out of my brain Ryan! :(
Story of my damn life.
It's comforting to know that other people's brains do this to.
yes.
Yep. That's definitely me and my brain. Only yours is nicer. Much nicer 😂
Wow I guess my brain is one of the supportive ones?! It was bad some time ago, but I think my brain and me are good now.
NO
Brain at 3AM: Hey, there's new Ryan George video, let's go watch it RIGHT NOW!
To be fair, if that no-laugh joke story was the worst thing that happened to you at school you're doing pretty well.
Sooo on point.
Love this guy💥
Fun fact: If you drink yourself into oblivion every night, you will slowly destroy you liver and stomach over time, and then eventually die. Then you won’t have to worry about sleep anymore 👍🏻
God. This is me every night, especially last night. Life sucks right now
Wow wow wow
[The Last Week, in a Nutshell]  Me: Alright, brain, we did good today! Brain: Yeah, you know it! Take it easy buddy! Me: You too, bud! Goodnight.  Brain: Hey can I ask a question? Me: Sure, what's up? Brain: *BREATHES*
the amount of truth in this video is incomprehensible
The accuracy of this video created a puncture in the fabric of space-time continuum
At 3am my brain just blasts Friday Night Funkin music
This is literally my brain every day especially with the jog part.
That's why I read until I pass out, and if I the sun comes up first, then a couple five hour energies fixes me right up for work.
This happened to me yesterday. I couldn't make it on time to an appointment to sign a contract because my brain kept reminding me of all the things I haven't said to my ex. 4:30AM and I was reminded also that a human body has to pee, God forbid your bladder explodes before breakfast. I arrived one hour late and now gotta wait until Tuesday.
91k already   It took every migos song from C3 2 hours to reach that   Funny innit
This why sleeping gummies were invented
holy shit one minute in and it has 15 k
Everyone under the age of 25 has no idea what is going to happen to their sleep habits …. Doesn’t matter whether it is due to kids, work, anxiety, genetic predisposition to “2 sleeps” (common before electricity), etc etc
My normal brain is always at 3am for some reason, but when it is actually 3am... I become a monk on crack a saurus.
how I feel every night
Every damn night
lol
Thanks
why is this so true
Brains really are the worst, I wish they’d just go away and never come back.
Wait a second, the Brain is supposed to stop talking at some point?!
At least you didn't get sleep paralysis and hallucinate all sorts of shit
Somewhere else...   Oh boy 3 AM!......*munches on krabby patty*
Can we just acknowledge this video was ingenious beyond the human mind
Lol this is perfect 🤣 because that's how my brain be doing sometime the illusionary trick in the dark with a coat hanger stuff look like a real person😂 to relatable
Just woke up and found this
This sums up every morning.
Read 'the idiot brain' to get the full context of this joke (and no it won't kill the joke).
This happens all too often.
Yesterday night I had a nightmare that there was a wasp in my room. While I was waking up my brain decided the nightmare wasn’t over and I heard a buzzing sound and felt it land on my back. I laid there completely frozen and terrified for a good twenty seconds or so as I felt it crawling on my back before realizing that it was just a dream and there wasn’t a wasp in my room. The mind is horrible.
Look at Ryan man, so inspirational.
What is it with 3am's?
His best video in a long time
Should have been Hat Man.
L O L
Yeah watching this at 4:15am I can 100% confirm this
Falling asleep is super hard, very much an inconvenience
I started laughing before I even watched it. Must be a Pavlovian reflex.
Nah, my brain also sleeps at 3AM. My bladder though!!!
I have one of those.
You couldn't have posted this on a better day!! I can't stop laugh because EXACTLY THIS happened to me last night! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Funniest channel on yt period
This is the exact truth
The saying the joke twice is too relatable and honestly made me sad
I was stalking your page and saw this right away!
My brain at 3 AM: Are we in simulation? Why is it called balloons? Who invented Toothpick? Does clouds have souls? Is my mom a robot? Am i a robot? What if am actually a robot but didn't know it?
My Brain at 3am:  Retells every embarrassing moments and anxiety.Great video
Watching this at 3am doesn't help lmao
Lol
12 years later I'm still hoping to get that jog in.
Ryan!...  Where's the Ad-Straunt?! Come on? 🤪🤣 I look forward to that guy! 😭😆
This reninds me of the sing "3 O' Clock Things"
Me who foes to bed at 3 AM: *I don’t have such weaknesses*
Literally me last night...
*Relates intensely*
Did you meet my brain?
It’s 4am Rn
"I guess that we should go for that jog... yeah no..."  🤣 everyone has been there before!
Made me giggle uncontrollably for a minute lol
Hilarious and depressingly accurate.
lol the joggggg
My life
YOU ARE THE BEST
That's nice. I do this with my phone.
😂😂😂
I read this as Brians..... 😆
Not realistic. Ryan George has never said a joke people didn't think was funny.
Time to watch this at 3 am.
" We have a very big day tomorrow"  its 3 am  it already is tommroow
Hahaha! Yes. Just....yes.
This is so spot on, I believe 3am is officially the Bitchy Brain hour - far scarier than any witching hour could possibly be!
11 brains didn't like this
I bet you came up with that idea at 3AM in the morning whilst stressing out over not having any more material for your channel
This is soooo #relatable
Next up: The constant conversation with your brain, about arguments and missed opportunities for clever comebacks, while in the shower.
My brain at 3am: Dont sleep think about clowns
OMG THIS IS SO SPOT ON
Yep, been awake since 3:00am this morning, and can't get anything started, much less done.
Brain: Hey, you know that dream you just woke up from, the one that you can't quite remember? Well if you don't remember what it was about, you're gonna die. Me: *Nods Off* Brain: WAKE UP AND REMEMBER THE IMPORTANT DREAM!
I have a existential crisis now and then, I hate it.
Too true to life. Now do the first person to take antidepressants and at the end "Hey, I can no longer feel my penis, is that normal?" "Sure, that happens sometimes. Try mastubating for 7-8 hours a day, that seems to help."
"Creating an existential crisis overnight is tight!" - my brain probably
I have never seen a more menacing looking brain in my life.
My brain at 3am: “Everything we see on tv is real.  There was an explosion and you were in a coma but now you have superpowers”
That high school one hit home for me   I'm currently in high school, help me
😂🤣oh my goodness! I have not actually laughed out loud like that in I don’t know how long.  When homeboy’s brain decided to remind him about something embarrassing from the past…has happened too often!  But like, why though 🤷🏾‍♂️😅?
Yeah... it's 4am right now and I'm not going for that jog either
Heh, just wait until 4AM
It is 3am here and I am thinking of sleeping. Nice timing.
Is that my anxiety o_o
Me:woke up in the middle of the night at walked away from the bed and saw some staring at me  My brain:freaks out and switch on the light Me:(when the light is on) it, s just the mirror My brain: dude you look ugly Me:
hahaha, my brain was like this the last two nights! 😒😁
So brilliant, man... Best creator on YouTube
the end is kind of like one of daniel thrasher’s sketches, i like humor like him and u it’s funny and entertaining
Now I know why I can't sleep when I have an important day coming up. I have a Ryan George brain.
That "school embarrassing moments" is way too accurate lmao
My brain is like, “Hey, remember that time that person you love said something that hurt your feelings? I know they apologized and everything, but you should still feel sad about it. Oh, and remember that jerk on the internet who has never met you but who said something that made you mad? Yeah, you’re still mad about that.”
Yeah
THE BEST SO FAR!
Currently 3:00 AM here in South Korea. Definitely wide awake. Can't Fall Asleep.... Can't stop watching random Youtube clips.
This gets even more relatable and darker if you replace the word "jog" with "job".
This is the earliest I’ve ever been
Somehow this is actually really true
The high school section is so relatable
So are Brians tbf
This hits too close to home!
🖕😫🖕 brain!!!! Yeah. That's right. Both of em!!!!!!
I hate that I relate 😭😭
Turns off light again: “oh my god is that a demon?!” Repeat this process at least two more times
Nailed it!
THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST ME
"So now we're going to spend the rest of the night worrying about how you would have disposed of the non-existent burglar's body if you'd killed him."
i’m sure having two first names would keep you up as well, “Mr.”George
My brain at 3am: Ryan George's skit said he made a bad joke in high school and a football player made fun of him. Was that just for the skit, or was that a true story? 🤔
I feel this needs a “my cat’s brain at 3am” follow up.
Finally, my brain feels represented!
Ryan: I guess we should go for that jog. Ryan's brain: We're not doing that. Ryan: Yeah, I know.  We've all had this conversation.
Certified Greg moment.
Why is your brain acting like my cat?
This is one of the best ones I've seen, I laughed so hard.
missed opportunity for sheets and giggles ad
Last night when I was asleep my brain started telling me that my nose is blooding, I didn't believe him so when I woke up my whole face and bed were covered with blood.
This is line for line gold
One time at camp somebody hung a celling fan from one of the rafters of the cabin to air it out before we went to sleep. That night I woke up in the middle of the night the first thing i saw was the fan. I in that moment 100% though one of my cabin mates killed themselves that night. But it was just a fan
FUck I watched this at 4am and now my coat is gonna kill me
Maybe time for that brain freeze as punishment
My brain at 3am: So what if you die every time you sleep and your body has a new different consciousness with the memories copied from the previous consciousness each time you wake up. Me: ...
Now I want to see a full tv series or movie of some poor people with their weird wild external brains. Like pets, but with insecurities and wild tangents.  Ryan, you could pitch that! Like, have a meeting about it with some producer guy. Like a....meeting where you do a pitch for some movie.
This video could be better if there were more ryans portraying different parts of the brain.
So accurate
when my brain do that I and up for an hour or two
Dammit Ryan ! You should be put behind some bars for the crime of accuracy . 😁
I take four pills a day for the asshole you just made a video about..
Do you have a lot of cats?
My brain at 3 A.M   La La dee La La Haw La La Haw La La Haw Haw x100
Me at 2AM: well, this looks like a fun video to watch
My brain at 3AM:  Oh? Sleep. Pfff. Dont worry. You can sleep later. Anyways, remember those horrible things you did 3 years ago. Oh also, here is some regret and I'm also gonna just raise your anxiety. Hmmm. You seem upset now... want some tears? Okay. See you later.  My brain at 6AM: WAKE UP YOU LAZY PEICE OF CRAP GET UP AND DO SOMETHING. Haha, now that you're up. I'm gonna make you feel very demotivated to do anything but also make you feel very guilty about it
i remember the joke.😓
I cant describe how much I relate to this...
Brain: Hey, remember all those times we got suddenly woken up by some kind of actual emergency? Me:... yes. Brain: I'm gonna just... vividly imagine those things happening again periodically through the night. Me: Why? Brain: Because that's what I wrote here in the script that I was gonna do, so I'm gonna go ahead and do that.
Forget 3am, my brain's a jerk 24/7
It's 1:59 AM currently now
Yep. Been there.
My Brain after the second Covid19 vaccine.
I’m in this video and I don’t like it lol
I thought you where dead man.
That is literally my brain
i see how "Brains Are Jerks At 3AM" could become a series
He still woke up at 7AM?! Some overachiever we have here..
Ryan are you secretly the FBI keeping a watch on me via my smart cellular device because this hit way too close
Sleep: OK! My time to shine! Brain: *steals spotlight* how bout no?
Do you remember that?
How can you not notify me of a new video and instead i find it on my "recommend" page randomly when im subscribed?  YouTube: its actually super easy, barely and inconvenience
Very good
Hello there
Is this why I suddenly wake up at 3AM? My brains making me think someones opening my closet door and rummaging through my kitchen each night?
3am brain: "Hey, I wonder what an anteater skeleton looks like..... Yeah, I know we should be sleeping, but what's an anteater skeleton look like?"
"First guy to wear clothes?" :D
My brain is like this but instead my brain says “consume the bagel downstairs in the cabinet to the left in the plastic bag by the Cheerios”
Good morning we should probably go for that jog nope not doing that yeh I know. 🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂⚰️
SO U HAVE A MOVIE FOR ME? WRONG CHANNEL!  WHOOPS, WHOOPSIE!
Thank you 😂😂😂😂😂
I hate how we put clothing somewhere and we think its something here to kill us. happens when my paralysis demon wants to say hi
A shot of adrenaline at 3AM because of a shadow that may or may not be a killer or a ghost is TIGHT.
Hello conscious, my old friend.
It is great to see that my brain is not the only one who hate me xD
5am brain finally asleep  Bladder: sooooooo you need to get up like now
This is why I have decided to become nocturnal forget returning to monke, I have evolved to bat
Hope it's a new thing this is awesome!
Probably the first time Ryan is actually talking to himself
This happens to me too many times
Not every video is a hit. This was a Banger tho!
Brains be like: I have all the knowledge in the world, how about I use 2%
I didn't subscribe to get personally attacked.
Uploaded at 3 am here in Asia! Great timing
i agree
that's why i don't sleep at night. :D
I see ghost orbs at 0:57, it may not be your brain, it may be a Phantom. Check EMF reading and freezing temps.
What I love most is that when this video came out, it is currently 3:00 a.m. Korean standard Time where I'm currently living 🤣
Then the brain did a backflip, snapped the bad guy's neck and saved the day
No one:  My brain at 3 AM for some reason: "ey yo bruh where's your birth certificate?"
That was exactly me this morning between 1 and 5 am!
Brains jumping to conclusions are tight!
Ah, the three am brain, the greatest foe of early morning must not miss appointments!
His facial expressions say it all
For a second I was terrified as hell
This is doesn't feel like a video; this feels like an attack
I have to fall asleep sitting up, b/c every time I start to lose consciousness, my brain whispers “This is exactly how it will feel when you slip away forever...” and I jolt awake in a panic. My thoughts spinning around my own mortality, and the fact that my loved ones are constantly deteriorating and I will have to watch them die,  and frequently my brain will present to me all the cumulative suffering on the planet... from human children going hungry to the suffering of every wild animal that dies a violent, lonely, painful end... and my brain tries to feel that pain, to model that suffering in my own mind... and it crushes me and panics me, b/c I am powerless to help alleviate any of it... it feels as if someone is drowning in the next room, but in powerless and empathy, with the moral responsibility to intervene, but the reality of in action... it seems the least and most I can do is panic... (if you know That Mitchell and Webb Sound, you know what I am referencing.)...  I uncontrollably, automatically and unconsciously, model the suffering of others, in my own mind... I will take the weight of the world on my shoulders... when there’s nothing I can do about any of it. So it takes several hits of cannabis to get back to sleep
This represents my entire night every day
Bro you are sooo good
sad
BRAIN AT 3AM *CHALLENGE*
This is too funny and relatable 😂
Brains are jerks at 3AM? You clearly haven't met Bladders and Colons at 3AM.
I'm watching this at 2am now
We're not doing that.  I know.
*Taps to forehead* Your brain can't keep you up at night if you get black out drunk every night
I'm early   ...and yeah I'm smug about that ...sue me.
3:00 AM  Brain: The pen that is currently on your desk will never have the opportunity to taste a tomato  Me: Good point. Now stfu and go to sleep  Brain: The opposite of waterfall is firefly  Me: Brain...  Brain: When you wait for a waiter, you become the waiter-  Me: BRAIN!!  Brain: Ok, ok I’ll shut up  Me: Thank you  Brain: Btw you have a test tomorrow
🤣🤣🤣🤣 more of that please
Nightmares: you're gonna get murdered  You: Nah  You 40 years later getting murdered: Okay yeah I see what that was about now
This is what sleep paralysis is like.
I didn't realize Ryan had hidden cameras in my bedroom. I feel violated and exposed.
My brain tag teams me with the bladder...
I'm gonna go ahead and say that high school joke football player story was definitely a true story and I've died inside for little Ryan George. It'll be okay, little buddy. I'm sure your joke WAS very funny and someday you'll grow up and millions of people will think you're hilarious. Bet that football player didn't grow up to be in NBA and throw home runs or whatever. In his face!
GET OUT OF MY HEAD.  D:
That’s my now, 3:30am, hyped with the E3 and insomnia
This is the most relateable thing I've ever seen.
That cut at the end is too good 😂😂😂
… super relatable!
jogging is lame, i get my blood pumping by walking to the bathroom.
Brain :we are going to get so much work done .Tomorrow:you sit on the toilet wondering why you had Indian food last night.The next day : The work is due What!
I legit stayed up till like 4am cause of bad thoughts
Tell me about it; my brain woke me up _every two hours_ on the dot last night.
Next vid: Brians heart 💙
This is why you guys need white noise in the background :P
My brain at 3am: Allow me to remind you about something that happened a year ago that you needed to remember a week ago
The highschool joke memory earned my thumbs up!
My brain is always a jerk. At least it lets me watch Ryan George videos!
*Me:* watching this at 3:00 am
almost 9k likes with only 11 dislikes. how it should be
You are the only actor whose fan i am
Im lucky because I'm always asleep within 2 minutes
Fantastic!
"Oh, it's a coat" "Whoops" "Whoopsie"
That's totally me.😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That's why I drink to make the brain to shut up
I don't like the truth behind the dark side of my brain at 3am it scares me
How did RG get inside of my brain!!
I could watch 30 minutes this...
If I didn't exercise because of lack of sleep, I'd never exercise.
As someone with anxiety that brain dude is 20 feet tall with a tree for a club.
How is every word of this so true
**A line from the video to get thousands of likes** Hit it! You know you wanna!
I feel personally attack
Came for a skit and honestly I'm just feeling very attacked right now...
Yeah this is accurate.  Also gotta love how my brain will *not* let me fall asleep when it knows I have to get up at an ungodly hour and pull a 10 hour shift...   "Oh you really *need* that sleep, huh?"  "Yeah brain, I really fucking do. That's why I went to bed early."  "Yeah. It's like soooo important that we fall asleep, right? Like, imagine if you don't get enough sleep, how shit tomorrow will be! You could be too tired to drive and kill someone! Or die yourself!"  "I know, brain. I know. Can we sleep now?"  "And you wouldn't be able to think straight and do a really shitty job..."  "Brain. I went to bed 3 hours ago. I now have only 5 hours until I need to get up, can we finally sleep please?"  "Woaah 5 hours, that is so not enough! Let me give you a nice shot of adrenaline so you can worry about that!"  ". . ."
Brain: I think we need to sleep Ryan: You gonna help me right? Brain: ... Ryan: You gonna help me right?
I laughed so hard I cried
Funnily enough I woke up at 3am and watched this.
Accurate
My brain at 3 AM: UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS UP IN MY EVERYWHERE RA RA RASPUTIN RuSsIa’S GrEaTeSt LOVE MAChInE
This is unbelievably relatable
damn thats entertainment
WE
I literally havn't slept in 37 hours, I feel that.
Basic evolution theory for you: It's better to get scared 100 times too often for no reason than not to get scared 1 less time than necessary.
This is the exact example (“someone’s in the house, here’s some adrenaline etc”) I use when explaining to patients what a limbic response is
My brain: I could wake you up when the alarm goes off, but instead I'm going to wake you up an hour early. I'll make you think bugs are crawling all over you, so you wake super alert and nervous.
Pitch meeting for YouTube reaction videos?
Oh, he's a brain now, he decided
There is nothing more real than this
too true :I
Someone's been having anxiety insomnia I see...
The funniest clip ever!
Asyou get older that whole thinking you are dying thing becomes more plausible.
Dude this is literally the meme of the person sleeping and the brain saying random stuff
This is so accurate, for some reason from 2am until a while after 3 I will wake up for no reason sometimes and every noise I hear I think is someone trying to break in and my adrenaline levels increase by 100%
me hears a wall crack. My brain: ITS THE SLEEP PARALYSIS DEMON!!!
Where's the Adstronaut????
I can relate to this so easy, barely an inconvenience.
and then the brain did a think took away are sleep and ruined everybody’s day
great ideas Ryan very creative
Are we dying right now?
*Me trying to sleep*   Brain : Remember that embarassing thing you did 11 years ago?   Me : I will be haunted by my action forever
Just so accurate. So painfully accurate. Lol.
Not only the brain but YouTube notifications
Me: Ok cool we have a big day tomorrow. So excited. Better go to bed early so I won't feel tired the entire day.  Brain at 3:00AM: Hey so why are we all doing this? Like, all of humanity? What's the point, really. I mean, if you think about it we're all just on one rock in a universe filled with various rocks that may or may not be vastly different from ours. What are we striving for, exactly? Happiness? What for? Knowledge? Again, what for? Where should it all lead anyway? What's the actual end point for all living creatures in the universe? Are they all striving for happiness or knowledge or just conquering space? ..What for?  Me: ಠ_ಠ
Brain: You've got brain food for me? Ryan: Yeah, yeah. Brain: How do you eat all that. Stomach: Super easy barely an inconvenience.
😂
994th
I guess we gonna go for that jog. Yeah we not doing that. Yeah I know. Me everyday...
Totally me but instead of the going to bed and then waking up at 3, I go to bed at 4 🤷‍♂️
This reminds me of the question of why people decided it would be fun to start jogging for leisure
Oh my god, this video couldn't have come out at a better time.
My brain is basically Clippit the paperclip. "It looks like you're trying to sleep.... Would you like to review every failure in your life?"  No  Would you like to contemplate there are people who have been US president at your age?  No  Would you like to work out how long you've "got left", and what happens afterwards?  No  Did you know that poor sleep leads to negative health outcomes?  Shut the hell up, brain!  Stress, too...  Okay...  So.... Wanna pee??
My brain and I are so motivated to do things tomorrow it's insane! If I was in the tomorrow instead of the moment I'd be president at least
I thought the title was BRYANS are jerks at 3AM.
This is literally me
The real jerks are the ones that don't let you sleep
Both Ryan and need on the same day, and on a Friday
That's what happens when you don't have sheets and giggles
Hello
the dislikes are brains that don't want you to know this
And this is why I sold my brain to science and had it removed.
Watching this at 2am! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mines name is Richard at that time, cause he sure is a d*ck
The fact that this popped up before I was going to sleep is just...is just TIGHT
the coat hanger was too true
That's my brain all night every night or in the shower.
oddly enough i woke up at 3 am today
How does he come up with such hilarious stuff
The human brain is the biggest asshole in existence.
This is very relatable. I always see figures in the dark
WTH dude im thinking that theres something wrong with ryan vods today. then i realized its the background lol
Beautiful. also watching that at 3am Au
Sometimes I fear that everyone dissapead and I cant find out until morning so I have to activly get out of my bed and cheack
Me: Almost asleep Brain: Man, you were so stupid that one time-
Lol so true
My brain doesn't need to search for intruders bc it already gives me nightmares so I'm awake for a 3am chat
Embarrassing brain memories are the absolute worst
😂😂😂
“It’s a jacket it’s a coat” 🤣
My brain at 3AM watching Ryan's brain at 3AM.
Going to sleep? More like writing and scripting a 10hour long story in your head.
You forgot the part where every 30 minutes you calculate how much time you have to sleep if you fall asleep right *now* .   (but you never fall asleep right now.)
Lmao
What a coincidence it actually is 3 a.m. rn
Watching this at 3.40 am.
Part of Ryan's genius is the simplicity.
Dude is just straight up reading my mail with this video 🙈 Crippling, debilitating anxiety FTW! 😭
You're fucking genius
just discovered Ryan has a arm tattoo on the same spot as me! yup, just trying to find new reasons to love him even more ✌🏻 💕
God I love you Ryan so much
This is comedy gold Ryan this is up there with the pitch meeting guy you should do more of these
Thats why I hide under my blanket
So relatable
That's a totally accurate brain simulator, except mine does that from 11 PM - 3 AM.
I read this as Brians are jerks at 3am for a second, was confused.
My brain at 1:00 am: "let's keep thinking about how much sleep we're losing if we don't sleep and use that to not sleep but then repeatedly go 'I'll get 6.5 hours of sleep if I fall asleep in 15 minutes.'."
This is literally me and my brain
I pray you never run out of content 🐱😅 !!
I just saw "jerks" and "3am" and thought this was gonna be a different video
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
That time in High School bit was crazy funny bro
“hey so by the way a demon is outside and we’re staying awake as if it would help”
Have a amazing day
I just realised I stoped having darkness fear after start of depression.
Ryan, the only way to escape this problem is   STAB YOUR BRAIN WITH A PRETZEL
I remember the time when I was able to jog... not that I did.. but I remember the time when I was able to...
3am in Sydney!
i'm in this sketch and I don't like it meme. (but I do, it's really well done)
My brain skipped the second word in the title and i was expecting a completely diff video
why is that jog thing so relatable
My brain at 3 am is very different. It's more like "Hey, hey triceratops but monke."
Best Ryan George sketch ever, in my opinion.
My brain does this around an hour before I have to wake up for work.  Sometimes its negative thoughts like this, sometimes it's just some random memories.
Relatable, so freaking relatable...
💯 % true
Indeed
Me : "So you've got an embarrassing memory from the past for me."  Brain : "Yes sir I do."
We should go on our jog.  Yeah, we're not doing that.
This is the most relatable piece of media ever
That literally just happened to me
I love that the brain is the only organ that hates itself
This is my brain at any time.
Humans are weird... This never happened to me. O__o
YOUR NOT RYAN THATS MY NAME!
I hate when my brain interrupts my time traveling.
Brain >:(
Hahahaha omg I love this!
Dang, so true
......and so the ryanverse expands
Great, now I'm gonna stay awake at night looking for the camera you must have placed in my room.
Added to my list of videos to watch 15 times a day
Brian guy is Brian George...
i thought it was only my mind that did that
Why does this always happen
Get this video at 69 dislikes
Never surprises me to be funny
Basically all introverts
Only your brain is a jerk?! Wow you lucky dog! You should meet my gallbladder.
First person to make a sausage
I don't see why anyone would dislike this... Please, I would love to know why 😂
Do first person to get their ears pierced
🤣🤣🤣 damn jerks
Me watching this at 3am...
Hey it could be worse, at least your brain hasn't spent the last too many years being convinced we can hear really annoying sounds even when it's completely silent.
I wish I could actually talk to my brain.
I never realized that every meme is funny when Ryan does it. Is he next gonna be the lady yelling at the cat?
I was actually asleep rn and I woke up to watch a video about the same reason for me waking up. Coincidence? I think not!
“Hi there, hello!”—All my regrets and fears when  I’m trying to sleep.
My brain is okay and lets me sleep (usually) it's my body that's the problem. As soon as I become horizontal it suddenly decides to feel freezing cold but also sweat constantly.
"Yeah, we're not going that" "I know"  Why must you hurt me in this way?
I am going to remember tonight at 3AM
For all those who will watch this at 3am because you can't fall asleep.                                                                                           Hi :)
And when you're trying to sleep and it's like your brain is shouting at you to go to sleep and thinking it will work.
Me watching this at 3 am: My brain: see everyone is having fun! And you fucking don't sleep for me to annoy you 😐
1ST     jk
I was wondering if anyone else was scared of coat ghost killers.
Me seeing this at 2:27 am 😂😂😂
Can some psychology person explain why the productivity thing happens?
Relate to this is SUPER easy, barely an inconvenience 😲
I just read jerking and 3am so this is definitely not what I expected
Released at 3am in Australia lmao
Just when you think he may run out of great ideas. He’s an absolute genius
My brain at 3am: I don't need sleep, I need answers.
So then I did backflip and broke the coat rack's neck.
Wait, this guy is from another video.
I watched this at 3 am
Is Ryan's brain wearing a shirt with brain on it?
This is the best "at 3 a.m" video I've ever seen
My brain with light: OMG DID YOU SEE THAT SHADOW, IT LOOKS LIKE A GHOST THAT WANTS TO KILL YOU  My brain in the dark: OMG IS THAT A PERSON??
wow didn't know the brain was just another regular clone except he's wearing a shirt with a brain printed on it
You are awesome!
When the imposter at 3am
Breathing mode: manual
Wait where's the adstronaut?!!
This is to funny! So true, it’s always 3am :o
Why is this more relatable than most of the posts on r/me_irl and r/relatable
Dude the remembering embarrassing things in the middle of the night is so accurate but also really sad
Coating that person or supposed ghost with a jacket really sugarcoated Ryan's chances of not being harmed by that person / ghost.
In college we were at the local pub for dinner and someone in our group's birthday. One girl had given her a dildo as a joke gift. I said, to be funny, "Hey, I'll help you test it tonight!" No one reacted. I said it five or six more times, thinking no one was hearing me, before I realised everyone just thought I was being a creeper. I had become "that guy" without even meaning to. My brain likes to remember this kind of thing when I'd much rather just sleep. It will wake me up to think about this! I hate myself.
Yeah it's always 3am. There is a reason it's called the Witching Hour.
Then the shadow man did a backflip, snapped Ryan’s neck, and ruined everybody’s day.
Think about it from Brain’s perspective it never sleeps, all it has is thinking. All night long it can only think. You should have thought about that before did that stupid thing twenty years ago.
Yeah, my brain goes to really dark places at night. For instance, counting how old my oldest family members are, how long an average lifespan is, and how 2011 felt like it was yesterday. Yey, happy thoughts!
Why is this sooo accurate in everything I just watched. Including that joke joke!
agreed xD
That motivation for tomorrow goes every time you wake everyday
Me at 3 AM : B00bs..  **unzips**
My brain’s just a jerk always
Ryan George has found the perfect formula for successful story telling - relatability.   Someone should remind movie makers this concept exists.
I love how the internet keeps reminding me that I'm not unique
My brain is like ryans
Ryan George and the Brain. "One is a genius, the other's insane!"
Yee
Ryan: Sleeping.. it's super easy barely an inconvenience. Than the brain did a backflip and snapped the sleeps nack and saved the day.
The meme in 3d looks pretty epic ngl
First time i noticed that  Tattoo on the inside of your upper arm. Does it say"armpits are tight"?
Staying awake at 3am is super easy, barely an inconvenience
Telling Jokes that are not funny twice is Tight
painfully accurate
Brain: Remember that argument you had last 6 years ago and you didnt have any good response? Me: Yes why? Brain: Well, I know it's a bit too late but I have the perfect response now
Quick question for Ryan: Did you write this sketch before or after you found yourself in possession of a brain shirt?
Wow... Brains be like 🙄😏
Me:*past midnight in a dark room watching tiktok lovers show off there love * I'm sooo alone 😭 My brain: No you're not look to your left
No one: Brains at 3 am: -The Finland's borders are the Finnish line -Sleep is a free trial, and dreams are the ads, these are removed in the premium version (death) -Banana without a "b" are pine apples
How did you get ~20000 views in 10 minutes??
I got the same coat rack. Exceot mine moves on its own sometimes
I have a feeling he made this video just to flex that t shirt
766th
It makes total sense that Ryan's brain is settled outside his body
1:10 I hate you for bringing my middle school experience up
Me: Gets ready to sleep My Brain: Hey remember that time you farted in class and everyone stared at you
that coat thing allways gets me
Having sleeping issues is super easy, barley an inconvenience.
Early
That’s a fantastic example of my thoughts as I try to sleep every night. Altho the coat rack of doom is replaced with, “hey. I think there’s something under the bed. And we have to pee. Like, really bad. Think we can make it to the bathroom wo our ankles getting grabbed? What do you mean any of the four animals who sleep w you would’ve noticed a monster demon scary whatever thing under the bed? Maybe they’re in on it!” Etc.
753rd
It's 2:30 am here and my brain is making me watch that guy from YouTube again
Friendly reminder that Ryan's birthday is 10 days away as he was born on 21st June. Google it if you don't believe me.
😂
Yep.
Yay! No astronaut!! ❤️
brilliant!
Me trying to sleep. My brain: would it be possible to stop the Matrix by making a bunch of tornadoes on the desert?
🤣
This is beyond accurate
I love how he made the memes to a video
Isn’t it weird that when he called brains jerks his brain is what actually what made him write that.      Judas’
"I need to sleep now so that I won't be late to my early appointment tomorrow."  *can't sleep because I'm worried I won't wake up early tomorrow.*
It was a coat it was a jacket, a jacket a coat, it was a jacket
My brain makes me hungry in the middle of the night
Existential crisis at 3AM for no apparent reason is TIGHT!
First Guy to have pockets?
I woke up at 3 am recently and my mind just made me imagine a scene where i look at a bunch of people and suddently a girl looks at me and turns her head 360 degrees and that scared the heck out of me
Holy macaroni it's 3 A.M. and this video is talking about 3 A.M.
relatable
But 3AM is the best time to make brilliant, thought out internet comments that you will later on have to decide whether to defend or delete and pretend you never said.
I hate how at 11pm I'm often tired but don't want to go to bed yet but once I want to sleep around 2am I'm no longer tired.  Fucking brain.
All.Of.This.
Tha accuracy is disturbing
Brain always lying to me :(
Hi
Me every damn night
Also when you wake up in the night feeling like you just fell off a cliff.
My 3am brain was awake and would not let me go back to sleep lol xD
This guy just has a gift, he's effing hilarious!
Brain: There's a criminal in the house! Did you know that? Here, have some adrenaline. Me: I can't move. Why can't I move? Brain: Oh that's because I PARALYZED you. You know, just temporarily, while you slept. Anyway, that criminal will definitely get you if you don't get un-paralyzed soon. Or not... you know. Maybe I made him up.
The quality have improved, I like it
*2:55AM*  Brain: "Almost sleep ruining time."
“Yup, that’s a person here to murder you!” THIS IS SO RELATABLE WHAT THE HECK
Hey Ryan, how you doing man? You ok? We love you bro.
This is one of the most relatable thing I've seen all week 🤣
Why do we always think people are in the house to kill us? Brains are weird lol
Why does the brain act shocked when you realize it named itself?
Plz do one with "1st person to say every day sayings" plzzz!!
the joke part hurt
"Yeh we do not doing that"...  Indeed.
this is one on the first ryan george videos that isnt sponsored.
The coat hanger is actually Mr. Mahina from Key and Peele
so true
A random comment
I definitely have that ,,jogg routine“ with my brain every day 😅
Muslims can concur with me... Same thing happens when u start your Sallah.
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
This was every night before a big exam for me.
Bro my comment is 666
Amen, I have sleep paralysis and it's way scarier when you can't move
Hi
This is for the generation with fake anxiety.
And then the guy did a backflip, snapped the coathanger's neck...     ...and ruined his coat. All because he thought it was a murderer.
Gets a little less fumy after the 3rd or 4rt watch, but still great!
The one guy who disliked this is the football player.
Ryan's channel is basically just created in order to call all of humanity out on our own BS. I love it.
Oh, so you all also have a roommate name Brian that likes to speak about your insecurities at 3am for some reason.
And this is why I don't sleep in the nights.
Those 3 dislikes are offended brains
I'm gonna watch this again at 3am, so my brain can give me a thumbs down.
Uploaded 4 minutes ago and already 556 comments. 😯
Yup, this is pretty much my brain all the time.
Me last night lol
I thought it said “Brains jerk at 3am” lol
WHERE'S THE ADSTRONAUT???😅😅😅
My brain:   Where’s that shirt you forgot about for a long time but now suddenly really want to wear
Our brains refer to themselves in third person
Damn brain would make me the most motivated person to get things done at 3 a.m only to do a total 180 the next day
I have zero idea what you're talking about. This never happens to me... Never...  NO YOU SHUT UP!
Im new to ryan George but i love to go back and see his other videos in the past
Yeah we're not doing that....I know
Cut me deep. Cut me really deep just now.
Three minutes ago lol
Its 3am in Australia rn I can confirm this video is all fact
For me, it's "Heeeyyy, I just thought of a new story! It's so angsty, the characters are freaking out, and you can't help but absorb their emotions! Screw sleep, we're writing!"
"I want a t-shirt with a brain in it. But I don't want to pay quite as much for it." "You can buy one and then use it for a sketch to make the purchase tax-deductible." "But how?" "I don't know, I'm just your brain! Think for yourself!" "You're always such an ass at 3 am!"
Huge Irony the Ryan brain character is literally a guy with a brain on his t shirt. Super tight.
2300 likes to 2 dislikes Tight
u are da best Ryan, Hope u get 10 mil subs soon u really diserve it, well done!
0:57 is that an orb, next to his shoulder?
Ooh..Brain Accuracy is TIGHT..!

The First Guy To Be Wrong
I eat food
Did you have my brain as a consultant for this script...
"So we should go for that jog?" "Yeah we're not doing that" "I know"  Spot on!
brains are stupid at all hours of the day   help how do i delete mine
Sleep deprivation isn't Tight!...
Oh man I forgot to go jogging this morning. That's like sixteen years in a row now =(
600 comments in five minutes
i was here before 1k views
The brain just like randomly wakes you up at 3 am to tell you that your life is in danger and also that you're a failure to the society.
This is very relatable
i dont feel like this is not calling me out
Yep!
a
Mistaking  coat for a killer is super easy barely an inconvenience
3:00 A.M. Brain: There is somebody standing in the corner. Me: Screw him. Why do I have to pee so bad?
I love your vids
Gotta wake up early, better go to sleep. Brain: oh yeah, let's do that... Hey, wanna think about every thing you could've done differently in the past 30 years real quick?
Ooop. It me.
Wow it’s scary how accurate this is
yes so early! and right before work! Edit: thats pretty accurate 😆
Okie dokie
We need part 2 Were not completely satisfied
This was 4 minutes ago….  Also I feel called out
Brain: if you fall asleep right now you’ll get 3 hours 58 minutes before your alarm goes off
wow.. finally.. my life on the big screen 🤣
My brain at 3AM: I can see you're trying to sleep, so I would like to offer you a fine selection of every memory, unresolved issue, or things you should or shouldn't have said or done in the past 40 years.
That's exactly why I never go jogging
"I don't wanna speculate, but we are definetly dying" Well there was no speculation involved
Yea they are jerks
Ryanverse😂
I am at peace knowing that Ryan's brain also talks like that!
Me waking all night do just like  that and then hearing other people  just shitting on you by telling they waked up till 1, 2, 3 am.
My Brain: Hey, remember spiders? You hate those things.  Me: Yeah, don't remind me. I'm trying to sleep.  My Brain: Yeah. Anyway, there's definitely one crawling up your leg right now.  Me: WHAT THE F*CK, BRAIN? WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?
Bruhh... these are thoughts which go through my brain  every night.
So I’m assuming this is the form guy to make desserts seeing how he actively has conversations with his brain XD
I am merely posting a comment so there wont be 420 comments.
😂😂 brain: hey remember that time when we thought of doing a backflip to snap the bad guy's neck and save the day  Me: ******
"Everybody we know is gonna die someday, you know? Are we dying right now?" My brain... every... single... night...
I would like my brain to be a me I could look at, because mine does all this and more and sometimes I just wanna look at my brains eyes and ask what kind of stupid psycho son of a bitch it is!
when you sleep pearlized:  Edit: I Was Wrong sorry lol
Yeah we're not doing that😂
brain tryping to hurt itself
well my brain is a jerk at 11 PM
make a first guy to own a dog video
Soooo true :1
this is the earliest i have ever been to a youtube video
This reads as a pasiv-agressive video by someone who woke up at 3:00 AM...
Lets go for a jog...We are not doing that...very relatable..
0:29 - 0:49 The Bye Bye Man (2017)
That definitely happened to me
Ok brain I need you to get all the way off of my back about that high school tragedy
sooooo relatable
Now I lay me down to sleep....
Called out.
Don't forget the "(gone wrong)" and "(he came to my house)".
our brains are hardwired to see people. its not his fault
My brain just thinks about giraffes having squishy necks at 3AM
Very relatable
Me: Wants to sleep  My brain on Christmas Eve: No, we up all night
Literally last night I was looking up the chances of being murdered cuz I kinda didn't wanna die...
I feel personally attacked.  Also, this is the hardest I laughed at a Ryan's video or pitch meeting, hands down. 😂😂😂😂
519th
Watching this after having 3 nights of insomnia.  Ryan George get out of my head!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!
As a person who wakes up at 4am, I don’t know how I feel about this.
My brain is like WOW LOOK AT THIS SLANDER and I'm like I mean if the running shoe fits...
Ok I’ll be real, this exact thing happened last night where I thought I saw someone and it was at 3 am
Me: Alright if I fall asleep now I’ll get plenty of rest.   My brain: sounds good, let’s do it.   My brain at 3 am: hey, hey. Ryan George videos are tight.   Me: was it really so hard to let me sleep 8 hours?   My brain: oh absolutely, we can’t do that, it’s kind of a problem, really an inconvenience.
Oh I got one worse. I have VISUAL AUDIO hallucinations, so I hear people having conversations or screaming and there's nobody there. And the visual hallucinations walk around.
HAHAHAHAH YES!!!!!!!
Relatable
3:15 - finally falls back to sleep  Brain: Cue bladder - stage 5 emergency
Ok now you're just bullying me        But for real love your work        But for real stop
I would be terrified to talk to my brain as it knows all my secrets lol
Thanks Ryan, you brighten my day with this. Hilarious!
This hits hard on so many levels.
The last time I was this early, my brain was letting me sleep.
People watching this at 3 am: "OH MY GOD HE IS RIGHT"
Oh My Devil!
My brain is like WOW LOOK AT THIS SLANDER and I'm like I mean if the running shoe fits...
My brain feels personally attacked
You missed the part where brain sings Baby Shark for 3 hours.
Being very early based on recommendations is tight!
This was so great and so true
It’s a jacket. It’s a coat.
It’s sad how much this applies to me
hello everyone
lol this is hilarious another awesome video
the dislike is from your brain
The steps of your brain:  Going to bed: 0:00, 0:01 - 0:11  Greatest scare: 0:16, 0:30  Reveal:  0:46 - 0:55  Brain realizes mistake: 0:55 - 1:00  Brain states the obvious; 1:01  Your trying to calm down: 1:01 - 1:10  Brain states some embarassing memory: 1:10 - 1: 24   You who experienced this already: 1:24 - 1:27   You trying to wake up  1:27 - 1:37   Me using my brain to type this:
Anyone else got dejavu while watching this
lol literally me ever night
Your videos are so entertaining and relatable. Love it 😊
I probably have never laughed so much at a video when he said... “Oh is that a person?”
do first guy to give a massage  "i'm gonna hurt you" "oh my god" "but the pain is gonna feel good"
I’m in this video and I don’t like it
Brains Are Jerks.
I clicked this the second you posted this does that make me and all the other people stalkers also that is relatable 100%
I gotta watch this twice lmao
Man this relatable
I think your Success is making you lazy
This is just too real.
"Yeah, we're not doing that."  It's like he steals my very thoughts and monetizes them on YouTube.
Love your videos ! ❤️
lOl
The pain is real
Most accurate thing I've ever seen
Just pretend i said something funny about Ryan being a clone or pitch meeting reference
Early yasss
I felt extreme stabs from that flashback
this happens every night and i hate it
Sometimes I remember unpleasant things from way back that I had completely forgotten. Now I know why. My brain hates me.
Plz
Tattoo reveal? Or did I miss it in past videos?
Welp
More like, 7am hits: Oh fuck, now I'm 30 min late to work if I leave right now. Great.
Ryan George I want you to do a pitch meeting for all the Kung Fu Kung Fu Panda movie
This is my brain exactly.
First person here, and it is hilariously and accurate. Keep up the amazing work 😂😂😂  Was here after the video turned 9 seconds old.
I really gotta pee. I'm not getting out of bed
Every goddamn night.
They really are
At least it hasn’t made up random fake scenarios for you to embarrass your terrible social skill even more...
😆😆😆😆😆😆 this is on another level of accurate
👍
Being early is super easy barely an inconvenience
"Hey remember that time...." is the only way my brain knows how to start a sentence at 3am. 🤣
So realistic it hurts
XD
I wish my brain worked like that but my brain just has all those thoughts right before i try to sleep until i ware myself out from thinking 🤧🤧
You made a video about a meme... Great job
Thanks for the great content
its about 10:30 am here... my brain's still being a jerk. stuck between 'starving but too lazy to get up' and existential despair.
Coming up with an original comment nowadays is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Hey how did you know about that incident
"I guess we should get up and go for that jog Ya we aren't doing that."  Me most mornings
Brains are the worst
GDI i had to watch this at 1:25 AM. That jump scare got me lmao.
Brain : there is a person in your room  Me assumes it's a coat turns on light it's a person . Me oh fuck
Ah yes, 1 view, 6 Comments, And 87 Likes.  Makes sense. Youtube needs to stop consuming/using substances.
That was so true lmao
I don't enjoy how hard this calls me out
I was literally just thinking about how I needed anther Ryan George video.  And this is absolutely my brain at 2am, 3am, 4am.  Get out of my jerk brain.
Does ryan have a tattoo?
Dude I have had the the clothes person thing so many times
Whoever did the 1 dislike sucks
The trick is to stay up 'till 4am. Really wear out your brain and body.
1 view and 361 comments Go home youtube you're drunk
Being early is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Brains are just the worse. I keep mine in jars
Relating to this is super easy, barely an inconvenience
So true 😂😂
Me: The burglar can’t get into my house Brain: Actually it’s gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience
This happens to me all the time. Anybody else.
This hits to close to my personal life
I can watch this when the existentialism hits me tonight
Plot Twist: The Shadow man turned into the coat hanger.
Lol
It’s 2:26 here and I can confirm this
this is 100% relatable
Your brain being a jerk at 3AM isn't tight
This couldn't be more relatable if he strapped a mask of my face to his face.
My brain is a jerk to me 24/7! :D
3:26am where I am rn and exactly the conversation im having with myself..
Ouchie that hurt
Hi there hello.
Yeah that's 100% true brains be like that
A random noise will make you think there’s a murderer in the house or you jolt your leg for no reason and wake up
"do you remember that?" "......" "do you remember that??" "YEAH, I REMEMBER"  XD
“Yeah we’re not doing that” “I know” the accuracy 🤣
Wow. I've experienced all of that....
This is way too relatable. It’s kinda terrifying how accurate it is to real life.
Brain: hey do you remember that time you told a horrible joke, no? Well too bad remeber it
First
It's 12:26 pm and and I've been awake since something like 12:00 am
That brain is creepy
Hi hello there
Amazing as always
Don't forget staring into the void at 3:00 AM for no reason
I survived the Gulag.
My brain is in this video and I don't like it.
It was super easy, barley an inconvenience stopping what I’m doing to watch this video
I love how he fell back in bed saying oh no
sad boy hours :(.
#Supereasybarelyaninconvenience   Try not to break the chain.
True
When theres 336 more likes then veiws, you know this will be good
Genius
Early
Same
I will find who ever this brain guy am gonna bully him till he dies
He is literally my brain
This video was tight
Brain:”hey, you trying to sleep” “Yea” Brian:”well remember that thing you did back in 2012, wasn’t that so awkward, aren’t you a piece of crap”
Hahaha.  Yeah,  that's my brain when I'm stoned.
Magikarp
This exact video literally happened to me yesterday.
I love how Ryan as the brain is just Ryan in a t-shirt with a brain on it.
LOLL so true
Fortunately, I don’t have this problem.
Never really got scared from stuff in the dark
Can you do a video on the 1st person to see a UFO?
When u know the haters have their notifications on: Not even five minutes posted and already a dislike
Okg
Good job man! Keep up the great work
Brains are tight!
First I think
I feel personally attacked.
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
It's super easy, barely an .  . . Oh. It is definitely an inconvenience
You forgot the classic all your friends secretly hate you.
OH MY GOD IS THAT A PERSON?!
GOODBYE THIS WAS ME LAST NIGHT💀💀
In retrospect there was a pretty low chance that was a killer
Mine is always a jerk
First
Ryan's the best
Me watching this at 3 am...
ehhhhhhhhh
Accurate as hell
607th view! 270th comment! 927th like!

THIS IS SO TRUE I HAVE A WEEIIRRDD BRAIN AND THEN THE ADRENILINE MAKES IT SO THAT YOU CANT SLEEP
Haha that’s why I can’t get any sleep
ah yes watching this at 12 am while having anxiety about my assignments that I have to start at 5 AM
Not first
So accurate lolll
There's 100 views, 738 likes, and 206 comments. Those numbers don't add up...
You should do the first guy to ever eat mushrooms.

Thank and I was going to sleep
It is always the jacket
This is shockingly accurate 😄
3:00 AM brains are verifiably not very cool 😑
lol
Not even 1 minute and the comment section already crowded
Always awesome to watch you Ryan
My brain starts going into planning an escape route, locating places to hide and weapons as soon as I hear a noise at night._.   It’s not fun, anyone else?
Being awake at 3 AM is super easy, barely an inconvenience!
Lol that ending doe
It is incredibly uncomfortable how relatable this is.
Ahahaha cool and funny vidio ! 😂😂😂
I mean yeah but you didnt have to call me out like that
Ryan, please don't. Not now.

Isn’t that right brain
Ryan George is the best
Of course this takes place at 3AM
I was just watching YouTube and somebody said “that’s something you would see at 3am” and then this video popped up…
that’s exactly how it works for some reason. especially me
Early gang have a great day everyone
Hey remember that one time we made three oscar winning movies in your head but then you forgot it the next day? Yeah sorry my fault
Oh my gosh, I haven’t even finished this but know it’s going to be the most truthful thing ever.
*mmm I'm gonna kick you in your sleep if that's ok buddy boy?*
This is an amazingly super accurate beautifully depicted version of how your brain acts all the time every day all night all the freaking damn time without giving you any rest EVER!!!!!!
Oh my God is that a person?

Therapist: “so how much do you talk to yourself Ryan?”   Ryan: “yes”
lalalal
POV your so early that your commenting without watching the video
Wait am I dying
Brain: embarrassing this guy is super easy barely an inconvenience
My brain at 3AM: I wonder what Ryan George will post next also you the day later:
too relatable :(

You make it to 3 am? I can’t even get in bed
