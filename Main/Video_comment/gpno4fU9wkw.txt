Good evening esteemed watchers! I hope you’re doing well and, as always, thanks for joining me for yet another episode…  I hope you enjoy it and I’ll catch you for the first episode in the Oklahoma series this Thursday!   ‘Til then, have a pancake or two 😘
As an insulin dependent type 2 diabetic with glaucoma and neeve damage in my legs I live vicariously through these challenges My word man you can put a team of linebackers and lumberjack to shame. ❤ fun videos and you and Mrs beard are the sweetest <get it?> Go get it!!❤❤❤
what's for desert?
❤❤❤😂
I need the waitress to degrade me… WHAT?!?! Who said that… must’ve been the wind…
Tis no man....Tis a remorseless eating machine!
rancid's a fantastic band btw
I would need a whole bottle of syrup for that.
I never imagined I would enjoy a show like this so much. Thank you!
Were you in Greensboro nc ? I saw a guy at a wedding that is a twin of you.
9:37 Yeah, yeah, whatever you say. Let's go get a room.
Watching these videos are awesome, and uplifting, thank you Beard, (Adam)!
Why you talking so much. To the staff.  EAT!!!!!!!!!
What's for desert? Is that from the kids menu??
theres a famous video from Massachusetts a few years ago where a drunk adult choked to death on a marshmallow.  He partner called 911 and the operator didn't explain how to do heimlich.   just saying.
That was one of my favorite songs back in the day.
I'm equally as surprised at how much kitchen roll you use 😂
"Could I possibly have a black coffee?" "Would you like sugar?" I don't even drink coffee, and even I know what black coffee means. Jesus.
Gallon of syrup
Damn you get to eat out Ruby Soho let me know how she tastes LOL
They’ll be ‘boosciff’ biccies from Lidl?
Jet black poo!!!! Legend.
Destination unknown
At 6:07.... That's what she said.
Always cringe when he wipes his beard/mouth. They probably think he could be cheating and trying to hide food in the napkin and take a closer look to make sure hes not.. I mean who wipes their mouth like that?
That absolutely is enough to cause someone to go into shock..
My new healthy eating goal is jet black poop LOL.
I'm soo confused about pancakes being served without maple syrup and butter.....is there really an excuse for that?
Americans pronounce croissant the same way as everyone else does. The only difference is that they don’t put the French accent to it, which is why it sounds a bit different. It’s the same word. They just leave the accent off. lol
I watched this video previously, but just came back to say how much of a jerk that guy was, who made Adam to eat a berry from the floor. I mean, seriously, man?! You couldn't bring a new berry from the kitchen if you're so bothered about the count?!?! Knowing this was going to be filmed and still picking it up and asking him to eat... Ugghhh 🙄
blueberries will make poop green not black btw)
Dirty floor 😞
Light Snack MOOOD
Ight listen I been a big beard fan for a hot minute now, however I just became an absolute SUPER fan because bro just mention a Frank miller book in the video and as a daily comic book reader, my guy. 🤝🤝🤝
I bet you would have demolished some salty fries after that! 🤣🤣😎😎
Is that pepto Bismal?
when she's really hot but you have to do a eating challenge now :D
I can't get over the absurd slab of wood they serve it on. Talk about spillage and mess. Put some spill ridges on that slab for fooks sake!
well, they could have been dog biscuits, so always good to ask... lol
Could he have found a THICKER cutting board / serving tray...?
marshmallows with pancakes? how disgusting!  Marshmallows really have little use beyond a cup of hot chocolate or a gooey pastry cookie... gross, chalky, and waste of calories... and a sugary-sweet milk shake... ugh... I don't know how people do it.  A glass of milk or cup of hot coffee or tea, but not more sugar to wash down all that dough and syrup...
Destination unknown, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Ruby Soho!! We love a bit of Rancid in our house!! Excellent punk band, excellent music, fantastic song!!
hey bro if you happen to see that jet black stool again get that checked out by your doctor to make sure its not some upper GI bleed
"The Bootleg Biscoffs" now there's a name for a metal band 🤘
Tactical glass of pepto-bismol on the table
If there’s one thing I could go back and do over as a kid, it would be to take better care of my teeth. My parents tried to drill it into my head, but especially as a teen, I didn’t listen. Big mistake
No other female wrestler with exactly the same name Ruby Soho about 16 pancake challenge with all the cream looks pretty damn delicious and daunting task
He always makes me hungry❤😊
Went there as a kid on holiday as well...from Ripon....good luck in all your  nxt challenges ..
Song name??
Is this why you greatly dislike pancakes? Lol.
I was waiting for you to order something from the main course menu after that.
Bro that tingling you are feeling is diabetes 😂
I know I'm 2 years too late, but I really want to know what the bottom of your shirt says. Let's Get Caked? Let's Get Pancaked? I can't think of a pun that would make sense.
Ironic considering a lot of Christians support Israel
Cheers to the Rancid reference!!
but what does the shirt say!?!?!?
How the Hell did I miss this one?  It's 2 years old ForFrankSake.  I think "Beard" has managed 2 pancake challenges so far, but being a follower for years, he's probably not not making this one.  Pancakes are the enemy IMO (Although i've not 'til the end yet).  Hope i'm wrong, but when I open my own "food truck" i'll be making "The Beard Buster" Burger....Meal.  And you'll be done.  Spicy Mushrooms, a hell fire hot sauce in some sort of pancake batter type bun, but, added with a spicy bloody mary for the drink.  Basically, you'll be evacuating your spare "Y's" long before you're digesting it in a comfortable position.  PS...if you manage it, I want the "bloopers" reel, because that's a video until itself IMO.
Stop you're trying to steal the car car call the police
I wish he'd eat me like this.
Crazy excited to hear there’s a Cafe in the UK named after a Rancid song …. going to make a trip especially GIVE EM THE BOOT!
You should go over your oral hygiene habits in a video. I think your videos have such a massive reach could help people avoid a couple million cavities.
Thanks for reminding me of Rancid Beard!!!❤
There definitely all on drugs
That dudes obnoxious
5:17 Oh buddy, you should have a tooth pulled for that joke 🤣  Scary to think about what the future looks like, because doing these things to the intestines, can in no way, have a positive outcome later on, not to mention the toll on the pancreas... Impressive though 🙂
“Plus a plethora of treacles and syrups” sounded better than a lot of vacations
Adam your a poet and didn’t even know it great job 👍🏻🍜🥞🥞
You could have finished earlier if you hadn't talked so much.. lol
Good luck! 👍
I hope those pancakes are buttered..pretty dry if not, so much harder to get down.
Just found your channel today subscribed keep killin it Adam!
I always fast forward to five minutes in at five minutes. He is always about 1/3 to 1/2 the way through. He is my favorite eater!
Last time I saw you take on a pancake challenge, you crashed and burned. I hope you're ready for flapjacks today.
Was in this place this morning for breakfast. Shakshuka - absolutely fantastic... Recommended!!!
Ooh, that song's a banger...haven't thought about it in years 🎵
You never win anything? Yes you do lol
This RESTAURANT is also named after a AEWSUPERSTAR as well.
Wow, what an eating feat! I was so concerned at the eginning. because I thoughtpancake challenges were Beard's nemeses. But happily, Beard cranked this very hard challenge. There was so much food on that gorgeous wood block! You rock Beard!!
“If ya cry or ya spew…. It’s ovahhh”
havent seen a dentist in over 30 years. my hair is perfect!
i made a few pancakes to eat along with him and im full on the 3 rd cake , his cakes are much bigger. dudes a beast
Bird was after the D😊
I thought that was rude to get food off the floor and expext you to eat it.  Not cool.
How the hell did you pull this off but not the other pancake challenge??
Love Rancid!!!!
So at 11:28 is that a cup of Pepto Bismal. 😂😂😂
Those would be dry
Why in the world would that man grab that raspberry off of the floor? I would never eat at that place. That one move that man made shows a lot about his poor character and personality.
❤
Beard i can turn you onto some better music than rancid or iron maiden, check out black marble or black ceiling
Come to Utah!!!!!
I’d lick it if I had to…. That’s what she said
Thanks Beard, now that song is stuck in my head again. 😅
disappointed you didnt have punk/ska playin in background
On dessert challenges like these do ya smash some insulin before hand just to be safe ? Cause relying on your own production for that amount is risky as fuck
Shot glass of pepto to finish?
Adam, it’s safe to state you’re an English icon, I speak for untold when I say We’re double proud of you!❤️🌹🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
The people that say, "Is that from the kids' menu? i want to see them eat all that and then say some dumb stuff like that. Keep it up, buddy you are amazing 👍
I'm still catching up on your videos... This one was a good one.  The blueberry comments were funny!
This man is living  a dream life.. He keeps getting most delicious food for FREE!! And also earns a lot from YouTube as people love to watch.. means he is just doing one job.. E A T I N G !!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
Everytime i watch Adam i miss home. We used to live just up the road
Marry me mr beard 😊🤣🤣❤️
Grittier than frank miller 👌🏻🤜🏻
would buy a shirt whit a dirty table and empty plates on it on the front  and i would lick it if i had to on the back
I thought the pink candle was a glass of Pepto Bismol! 😂
There are a few channels that bring as much joy as does @beardmeatsfood. He is as entertaining as anyone else on YouTube, but nicer than all others.
You are definitely one of my favourites to watch on here and you are such a gentleman aswell
He really should cut his stringy hair and beard.
He did it!
what's the song at 1:11?
I cannot believe that they are usually doing the pancakes like that THICK, really tons of food, love to watch this channel 👍🏻✌🏻🤴🤴🤴
And yet a year later he was defeated by 6 pancakes in TX.
Ugh, I think a pancake challenge would be one of the most difficult. Pure carbs, heavy food, and I'm STUFFED if I can finish two regular size pancakes. I honestly don't think I could eat just one of those giant pancakes. HAHA maybe they'll give you a plaque.
A FREAK shake!!! watch P diddy doesnt head down
You didn’t do your “Let’s get it!”
This one all hinges on how fluffy those pancakes are.
That was crazy!  I'm familiar with the unrelenting intensity of a stack of pancakes and that was incredible.  Right up there with the Sister Beard 8lb steak challenge.
Ya know your generation is taking over finally when diners bein named after Rancid songs! Bet this challenge was a bit of a Time Bomb!
Love how you walk out of the car and people know who you are. You are my idol.
Wooden boards or slate tiles may look stylish, but in my opinion, they are not suitable as a base for food. Someone who was really smart invented plates. Let's use plates. 😂
I'd eat the cookies, the shake, and call it a loss. That's cray cray!
fairplay, I thought you were gonna fail that when it was brought out. good job
My pug’s name is Ruby Soho
Since there is no more Ms. beard, you need to go back to this place and ask the cutie waitress on a date. She was all about the beard. Cheers🥞🍺🍺🍻
Howdy ♡☆♡
That's what she said!😂
Destination uuunknown  Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Sohoooo
how are you still alive?
BLOODY HELL!..16 HOT CAKES!
A good part of these challenges is Adam's great interaction with the other nice, down to earth people ❤
I thought there was no way you'd finish that
And a glass of Pepto Bismol to wash it all down! 😂
If someone hasn't mentioned it yet, there is an American pro wrestler named Ruby Soho. :D
What kind of an ASS expects its patrons to eat off their dirty floor?!
Wow, dude required him to eat the raspberry off the floor... At least throw it away and get him one that wasn't on the floor haha.
❤
Followed by impossible pancake dumping contest.
1 hour max parking. England you can’t stop and spend money shopping without being fined.
not me thinking that was a little pink smoothi on the table ... it was a candle 🕯 😂
I thought you were staying away from pancakes?
What i like is its inderpendant food outlets, and they are mostly always glad to see him
Mrant to subscribe ages ago
I love his laugh
I'm an alcoholic haven't been to dentist in over 10 years
Lo ing the moulded flights
This is insane....lol pancakes are so filling idk how you got through all that
I love that slab of wood for food platter that's awesome
Up there with one of my favourite YouTubers I love your videos
Why isn't he making sandwiches?
"If',barack,you'd be even richer!
I love how British complain/make fun of us for how we(americans) pronounce croissant and comment how it's French and then turn around and pronounce filet...."Phil it".
Has anyone ever had to give you cpr? 🤣
Great video, but after watching you eat 2 pancakes I was full
Wow you actually completed a pancake challenge!
Pancakes? Let me guess, you fail?
This was hard work for some clicks. I hope he get‘s rational soon, although I have to admit I‘m glued to the screen watching him finishing off plates which were meant to feed 10 hungry homeless.
Should’ve played Rancid in the background😀
♥ I love this ♥
Not asking someone to eat food off of the floor in a commercial place...
The tea towel falling on the floor...
8:46 bear meets food
pancake trauma
Rancid is n awesome band
He can always resort to plan b. Squish the pancakes into french fry sizes.
Sometimes i look at the food they’re serving you and i think to myself it’s just a typical meal. I can literally eat that as my breakfast😭
Did he say he's attempting a Pine-cake challenge? lmao
This one looks easy compared to that Texas sandwich he struggled with 😂
We visited yesterday and you are still the only one to defeat the impossible on the wall of fame 🙌
I’m typing this in the same spot you sat! Absolutely amazing place!
Im wondering hoe much grams of sugar that whole challenge was
Beard if you went into porn with 4 M  following you.  The sky’s the limit.  Private jet, yacht, helicopter, log cabin on  private ski area.  PORN.  It’s all about the Benjamin’s baby.
Rancid is good stuff!
I have to click on it
Ruby Soho is a great song.
If Oliveoil and Popeye opened a restaurant...😅
Now that barista knows how to steam milk.
When I see that transparent glass, I immediately skip the video 😅
ahah ' i'll usually only groan like that when mrs beard tells me, her mums at the front door ' had me creasing
I wonder if these places get more trade with you guys doing these challenges
What was that pink substance you ignored?
I know you’ve said that at least once to Mrs. Beard 😂
I just noticed you blowing on cold food. It’s weird.
The Rancid plug makes me like you even more Beard!! Rock on brother!!
Unofficial T-shirt ambassador - BeardMeatsFood
should anyone tell him that twice yearly (every 6 months) is regular dentist cleaning frequency XD
"So that's the challenge done... Can I see your burger menu?"
If you eat protein with a sugary meal you won’t get hyperinsulinism
The pancakes are burnt no wonder the place is empty
Best teeth at a British Dentist Office? Is that good?
that's kitchen roll to anybody else its loo roll to MR BEARD HE NEEDS IT
First of all WOW that was a boat load of food! Second I was wondering the whole time if he’ would order dessert after which would’ve had me worried😅
Wow, he actually finished his pancakes for once… 😅
Ruby Soho easily one of the top 5 Rancid songs of all time so excellent choice for a name.
This would absolutely kill the fuck out of me 😂. How the hell does he stay in decent shape? (Also, not kidding, I’m type 1 diabetic so that many pancakes might literally do me in… either that or cause a local shortage of insulin injectors 🤣)
Pancakes are a deceitfully heavy food. Especially thick ones like that. You think after the first one you could eat 30, but another 2 in you're nearly done. Especially if they've soaked up a bunch of syrup. They may not be heavy in terms of net weight, but for whatever reason they're far worse than meat or chips in terms of me estimating how long till I'm full.  When I saw that stack, alongside all the other random sweet stuff, I thought you might actually struggle there.
This is the 1st out of 3 pancake challenges where I’ve seen the beard defeat the challenge. Way to go mate! I knew u could do it.
We’re about in brid is it? I want these pancakes
Evenif i could eat that I would lose with the marshmallows!!
Bro really made you eat the berries off the floor and not wash them off
looks sooo delicous 😍🥰
What is that pink stuff? Please don’t say it’s Pepto-Bismol.🤮🤮🤢
"I would lick it if i had to." If that was on a t-shirt I'd most def buy it
Great, Ruby Soho is stuck in my head now lol, not like it’s a bad thing though! it is a great song!!!
A RANCID reference...Just when i thought i couldn't like him more!😂
Rancid RULES! One of my all time favorite bands!!
Beard gets more likes than any u tube channel that i have seen.
Those aren't pancakes..they are cakes from a pan
Sat in there right now enjoying the hipsters breakfast with added poached eggs that's about my challenge so far 😂he can't praise you enough 😊all the best ❤
The cute waitress said, "Oh my God, he's absolutely smashing it."  I don't think Mrs. Beard will be pleased.
Greggo you should enter some eating challenges , it would be great for the channel
So much for that 5 second rule...
Legendary bro..ive a hole in a my tooth so this would off been rough. Love the selections though Ive not had a marang for so long I agree they're nicer a little guey.  Awesome staff to.
dude that's too much simple carbs/sugar. i cry for your pancreas! 😂😂
Can’t believe that turd made u eat that floor-berry… gimme a break… he didn’t want u to finish from the second you sat down- anyhoo congrats on finishing that coma well done mate
At least he knows his music...
The waitress was so nice - I like her 🙂
Now with its new name "The Very Nearly Impossible Pancake Challenge!" 😊. Nice one Adam that looked hard for several reasons, not least the amount of sugar involved.
There is a young woman food competition eater on YouTube around Chicago or Detroit. She is a power lifter. She eats around the Midwest. You two should collaborate. I cannot recall her name
These videos are so entertaining long after they were posted.  But honestly, it just amazes me that a person could eat that much. Every time.  I used to say , "no way" . But now I am just cheering even knowing he has no idea I am cheering many many mile away and a long time after the deed is done.  I like sweets regularly, daily when I can afford it. However, I hit the wall when it comes to pancakes. Just two of those would probably be my max. Especially with all the fruit, syrup and milkshake.  Being a huge Belgian style waffle fan, I can eat maybe four. Everyone is definitely made differently.  But now I am wishing I could make some brownies to replicate the milkshake. Will have to start on my grocery shopping list.  Meanwhile, I will eat some waffles this morning.
Chitty chitty bang bang
Funny thing is that all the people in this video talk funny like you!
I live near Brid and you’re not wrong about the mobility scooters. It is MENTAL
I looked at that lot and I said to myself, ''That is surely impossible''
Have you measured your blood sugar after that? Could be a record too. :D
Impossible not to get diabetus Challenge
You keep surprising me with your old school musical knowledge good sir. The last video I watched you mentioned old school Less Than Jake, I came up in that Ska/punk scene in California. That had me going back to give it a listen 😊🤝
But I hate marshmallows everything else looks good.
I love pancakes!
You can be victorious against the pancake monster
Adam: I don't know why I thought my oral hygiene was good table conversation... So anyways, my jet black poo :D
Ha! Love the Rancid reference. The song too.
Its the banana and marshmallows that ruin the meal lol
Destination unknown, ruby ruby ruby ruby soho.
. I got so much tartar I don’t have to dip my fish sticks in nothing
Hungrahhh
Great Rancid reference
Used to be in the Army, I used to drive around Bridlington in Four tonnes and Land-rovers.
Waitress wanted the beard
What a POS, serving up a pile of berries on a board, then picking up a single berry from the floor and making you eat it. Absolute loser.  Well done on smashing their challenge. Could you tell the loser wasn't happy about it?
I dont know if anyone else noticed, but that waitress was a smokin hot babe! Yeeeeew!!   Also good job smashing the pancakes mate!
Keep stuffing your face and do nothing else.
=)
Most important thing: did you get laid with the waitress in the end??
🇸🇪🙂👍🙃
Sorry but I have to say that the waitress in this restaurant knew you are married! I could feel her se…. Tension on the Telly! Luckily she dropped the napkin trying to be socoooooool ! It was great!👍
that young lady is a smoke show!
I've been to Bridlington once but the second I saw that ferris wheel I knew the location immediately!
Lol.  Love u pulled rancid out of no where.  Good band front the 90s
7:57 Totally flirting waitress 😭
He finally won a pancake challenge. Woo.
Pancakes Divorce Pancakes
That’s a holiday for you isn’t it? You love your desserts.
That's 16 frisbees.
As he started the pancakes, i went to simply to take a wee, washed my hands, got back and the pancakes were gone.....holy hell.
@ 8m 08secs,,, did you get that mallow on lap/floor?   If not, disqualified!!   🤣
I think he spit some of his food into a napkin   At 11:12
You should have had a bacon sandwich to finish off
Wow, that’s really a lot of sugar good job on getting that down
I think people just create these challenges just to get beard down to meet him, such a nice chap.
9:39 lol old man looked
“16 pancakes! Are you mad! You’re gonna kill someone!”   🤣
Two bites into pancakes and everytime I’m pissed I got them.
most annoying music in the back ground the whoel time my god
In addition to the elapsed time timer, you should include a count down timer or at least a static graphic of total time allotted.
U find this channel and your just HYPNOTIZED  because he's awesome 👌 👍🙏
What is the cup of pink stuff?
YOU HAVE ONE BLUEBERRRY, EAT THAT BEFORE YOU WIPE!!! That did freak me out
Nice!
That looks as tough as the Dallas Pancake challenge where beard failed...badly...and he had an hour not 30mins as here...
yah but a human would never be able to eat all that at once.
Pancakes 🥞 I 👍🏾 👍🏾 To 😊
Nobody else can look as much like “who” for dr Seuss than beard. That first few moments looked 100% out of Whoville downtown.
America to sunny Brid 😂😂 class love it mate
First time I’ve seen Beard finish a pancake challenge 🤣😭
HA! I was going to accuse ya of being a "fancy lad" since ya lost the rather plain pancake challenge yet aced this fancy one. Sadly I have to retract that particular mocking as you DID eat off the floor hehehe ,,, and not even a 5 second rule by the looks of it. And since I AM CANADIAN,,, I don't really talk like that ;) Nor do I say "aboot"... well maybe,,, on certain occasions. I don't say "mate" either as that would suggest a homo sexual pairing of some sort. NOT that there's anything wrong with that!... Whatever happened to "chum"? Yup that's it,,, henceforth I will refer to everyone as chum.  Anyway good job avoiding diabetic coma on that one Bro (oops "chum"),,, It really would be a pleasure to have ya at our next hometown BBQ event, but I understand yer a busy dude. Wait! Chum... hehehe love yer stuff, and I don't really wanna see someone attempt 5 gallons of chili. But yeah, I'll let you know when it happens next incase You and Mrs. Beard are ever in the Honeymoon City
So glad he did not ask for dessert this time 😂
Sick Rancid shoutout
I think you've got a second stomach 😂😂😂😂
2:10 Why was the guy covered in cream?🤔
"You cant have too much of a good thing"  Really bro? Every single one of your videos could be titled too much of a good thing lol
How long do u not eat before a Challenge??
How can this guy appear a superhero movie? THE PLANET EATER
Whose idea was it to serve a stack of pancakes and syrups on a wooden block with no fork or knife? I mean, clearly for Mr. Beard, that doesn't matter at all because he always eats with his hands anyways, but pancakes and syrup with no plate, no fork, no knife?
I had blue poop once. I ate a tube of blue frosting lol.
He could only eat half of the Texas pancakes.  This he ate with relative ease.   I guess the fruit helped
You are so awesome why have you slowed down?
Show us your workout to stay fit, on one of your episodes 🫡
Too easy for you... you could tell from the start he wasn't even concerned about this pancake "challenge".  Unlike the pancake challenge that really challenged him...   This was a snack in comparison 😄
You are funnee! LOLs!  They served the pancakes without whipped cream! Animals!
He's so pathetic for making you eat that tiny fruit off the floor 🤮
It always looks like he's just taking his time but he's getting SO MUCH done in that window, lol
Is that a glass of peptobismal on the side?!
Just missing some fried chicken, bacon and maple syrup >.> and some ice cream.
@beardmeatsfood  next time your in the US . Mt Airy  north Carolina  A place called SNAPPY LUNCH  has a pork chop sandwich challenge.  I think it's 7 sandwich challenge.  You'd kill that!!  And you get a Tee Shirt😂
Give me only two pancakes and that whole things looks delicious! So many blueberries and yum omg looks awesome
You should go to Amarillo Texas at the Big Texas I think you can do it
I'm more impressed with the chopping board that's a beast of a mutha 😀👍
If you want to know how to pronounce croissant watch Denis Leary no cure for cancer stand up video 😂😂😂😂 😀👍
Videos are getting a bit monotonous - only so many times asking for a dessert menu can be funny.
SPEAKING OF JET BLACK TURDS, IM ABOUT TO DROP AN OREO COOKIE SHIT RIGHT NOW!
Why is that waitress flirting so hard???? Like does she not see how uncomfortable she is making him? He straight up said she is making him feel like he is in a zoo and she still flirted back…..
Nice job! Your American accent version of “Adam” could use some work 😂
Is there anything you can’t finish? Would love a fail video if you got one. Just to prove your human ..😂
That looked stunning
I died when you said.  " I'll lick it if I have to "   🤣😂🤣🤣😂
No desert
What were you like as a child?  Did you eat a lot then?
Loved the cup of Pepto Bismol chillin on the corner the whole time.
I feel myself getting diabetes just watching this, lol.
Ruby Soho is also a bar in downtown Toronto... fantastic food and drinks and the best value in downtown Toronto...sorry about the liberal stench you'll encounter...but worth it!
I hope they’re saying “what’s for dessert?“ in posts because you always seem to order dessert!🥰 Cheesecake!
🎉🎉🎉
I’ll fully admit I won’t be able to finish any of the challenges you have done 👏🏻
I would hate this challenge. I cant stand pancakes. But seriously, were those mini marshmallows necessary? Who eats that many marshmallows? 😂
A cup of hot butter and a cup of hot maple syrup and just dunk it
9:39 legend... unavoidable glance
If you werent so chatty and WASTING the paper towel and time on your beard, your sitcoms would be so nice. If your beard is such a problem why don't you cut it off
the one to tell your kids it's a group challenge
"The type 3" challenge xD
You might want to get that "jet black poop" checked... could be internal bleeding from constant over-stuffing.
They shouldn't have served this challenge on a stool top.
Waitress is gorgeous.
You have only lost 14 of 605 thats craaaaazy and took a craaaaazy long time to figure out😂
"I'd lick it if I had to" put that on a t-shirt 😅
That pink liquid pepdobimal?
This is the first challenge I've seen that I almost think I could complete.  I always over-eat when we have pancakes, and those look amazing.  But then I am reminded of the actual count.  I might be able to do half those on a good day.  😂
Half price wills?? LMAO.
The extras alone are more than enough for me  The marshmallows seem over the top and unnecessary
I can eat a lot of sweets 5 pound bar from hersheys in Niagara falls 2 days it was gone I like it cold hard chocolate
Ruby soho is also a female wrestler !!!
Robert Turnbull should be paying for advertising on this video lol
what? no butter?
This man destroys toilets
imagine be a milionare and care about a parking ticket :)))))
Out of curiosity, do you wait till the evening to brush your teeth? Or do you brush your teeth ASAP after these big food challenges?
If I ate that much sugar I would literally die (and I know what "literally" means) so this is like watching a horror movie.  A good one mind!
“I would lick it if I have to” should be put on a t-shirt
A night doesn’t go by without watching a few of the beard, katina & Randy.
"Would you like to see a dessert menu?"
DUDE! HOW TF ARE YOU MAINTAINING YOUR WEIGHT ????
Looks like a Fabulous Place to eat!
I know and love that song!
I thought it was very lovely the way they served it on a giant plank!❤
The reference to Campbell, California’s finest in the beginning… 🤌
I know it’s your M.O., but I am quite upset you didn’t even try to make some topping combinations on the pancakes and just ate them separately 😂
Who was the hottie that was hanging out there for a few? Wish I lived over there, I'd frequent that establishment just to meet her! Wow! Oh, nice job Adam.
He is the best of the eater’s.  Humble and just a nice guy
Hi Mr. Beard, been watching your videos for a long time now and I've just realised what lovely eyes you have, stay hungry lol xx
And just look at how interested they all were...............walking away mid sentence, very, very funny!!!!      Joannie    .Regarding your tooth story, hum!!!!!
Your pooh turning black was a more information than I needed  . 😂
Those guys would make me laugh so hard i would be shooting chewed up pancakes out my nose.
Diabeetus
Every time someone beat the challenge they should add 1 more pancake for the next one!
Nice 👍 one Adam 🎉🎉
Man, didn't think I'd be listening Rancid tonight! What a lovely reminder...❤
She picks the towel up off the floor and doesn’t immediately throw it the the laundry. 🤔
GPS : Destination unknown
Beardmeatsfood: "I never win anything"  Also Beardmeatsfood: *Wins 99% of challenges undertaken*  😂
They said ten biscuits, I counted 11. Tryna do you dirty here lol
Was it a patty’toe chair lol (patio) your dear old Dads poor toe
Beautiful stack of pancakes, please hand me a shovel and a 5 gallon pale of syrup lol
Dropping the kids of at the pool would not do justice for his morning bathroom time
You don't chew, ofc you have good teeth
It's like the entire challenge was THE DESSERT MENU!  GREAT JOB ADAM!
The least they could have done was not burn them!! Did not look good at all. I'm amazed.  I love  watching your Video's You have a wonderful sense of humor.
beardmeatsfood 1 t-shirt
Send me 1 of your t-shirts bud
"Do you have a burger menu?"
WOW!!
My dad and mom took us on vacation to Las Vegas one year. At the pancake house he took us to for breakfast,  he did their pancake challenge. It was twenty pancakes (same size as your eating there,) three ham steaks and six eggs.  He ate it all and seven extra pancakes besides. He was a wirey little guy like you, too,
That Raspberry sauce looked so good, a nice shade of dark purple, perhaps it was the lighting, but it looked bangin' :)
the guy seems like a massive tosser
waitress is hot
The woman in the dark dress looks yummy 👍
look i know this is a 8month old video and the change that @beardMeatsFood answer me are probably 0 to none but dude i need to know what beard product you take like the shampoo and oil....this amount of sticky syrup in my beard would have ruined it hahah
bonus points for knowing who Rancid is.
When you over stuff yourself,do you get sweaty and can't breathe with that mound of food? How do you feel after this.?
Looked so good I’d eat it and just have leftovers lmao.. though the way my daughter eats she’d probably eat about half of that in one day 😂
If you were unaware that waitress, who was a smoke show btw, was totally into you! Sorry miss beard 😂
Next time do the habanero before the veggies. All that lettuce and cheese would have cooled it down
“Destination unknown…..Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho…….Destination unknown…….Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho” ah nostalgia ❤
Dude ,I love it ,1 bowl of beans I'm done,I want to see your blood test,lol
i have a beard its a pain yet its kosher  also i get   it plaque ice skating . you should help out furious hes lacking ideas... do a duet
Oh man, that looked so yummy, awesome challenge. And the speed with which you gobble down huge amounts of food is terrifying  😁 11:57 The only thing this needs, to be perfect, is a pound of crispy bacon.
You only have to go to the dentist every 2 years!?
He should add pancakes to it. When one beats 16 the next one has to do to win is 17 and so on. Would be a fun challenge
Wow I haven’t thought about that Rancid song in years, thanks for that!
imagine going on the toilet the next day
how do you burn all those callories??
However, is it possible that he is a leading candidate for president in the United States? I can’t believe he has any real support much less the front runner candidate for his party’s primary nomination. How is any of this OK with a significant portion of the Republican party, when even Brian Kemp is on air, communicating his disappointment and his commitment to the basics of the US Constitution
This sounds like a decant  challenge pan cakes oh the ounly rube soho I no is pro werstler but good  luck brew
Nice plate there.A bit small and effeminate but ok :)
What do you do with all the food that you ate? Do you puke it up or poop it all out?😂
this is the first challenge I've watched that I could possibly make a dent in.
that was such a cool t shirt!
Have you ever gotten food poisoning after one of your challenges ?
After that comes the toilet challenge. You are amazing. I am a 3 pancake man. You are superman.
Spent many a childhood in Bridlington have so many memories
Insane amount of food! I still don't get it how this is fitting inside of you.
BROTHER, I don't know why I'm so intrigued by you being my size and eating LITERALLY 10 times more food than I can eat.  Please Beard man, watch your health.  I'm an MD and you sir, are playing with fire.  Obviously, have a rock stomach, you never talk about purging after a challenge.  I'll keep watching with enthusiasm but I'm afraid I'm watching someone torture their health mate!!  Nonetheless, I'm obsessed with the channel.  This kind of comment probably eggs you on 🙂  And you are such a kind dude as well!!  Fun to watch you stuff your guts like a professional "eating" elite athlete.  PS I'm not an MD but I don't have to be to make that diagnosis LOL.
I could only finish a third of the pancakes only!  You crush it brother!
Pice of cake mate.. love from Phillipines phillpines
Love to see the beard eat good old southern style food
Your profession? This is not just a side hustle?
Anyone else realize he blew on the marshmallows and blueberries, so they didnt burn his mouth. 😂😂😂
Adding in all the fluids into the belly is crazy.
You make watching all this so much fun.
So I just found your channel today and and I'm currently on my 7th video. lol
Am I the only one that saw the elderly gentleman break his neck when she dropped the towel?   😂😂😂
BUTTER !!!
No desert after this? ..really disapointing.
lovely waitress
The shake and the marshmellows would probably do me in, but I'd love to have 16 pancakes in one sitting.
Do you chew gum?
I wish they'd invent a smellview for cameras 😂😂😂
I have a new hero!!! Epic!!
Wow that one would be brutal.  Sugar overload, the gag reflex would be in overdrive.
goofsadqwu
“16 pancakes, you’re going to kill someone!”  Average American: Lets make that 17 pancakes please, and bring out the appetizers before we start 😂
How do you start doing this?
I was kind of expecting you to ask for a savory menu at the end.
Waitress sounds like a GTA npc
Those pancakes look delicious! What a fantastic challenge! And to top ot off, the people are friendly and engaged... I would go there just to chit chat about the pancakes!
Beard!  Too sweet ... I could barely watch. You're an eatin'-god.  I can EAT but the sweets ... can't do them!!!
What's for desert? Is that from the kids menu?
did not know blueberries could do that
I love that Beard gets even more Northern when he's eating in places like this.
The Rancid reference - 🤘
The waitress was hella turned on watching Beard demolishing those pancakes! 😅
Gotta Love Pan cakes.. awesome challenge 💫🤲
i thought he was gonna crush that in like 10 mins lmao. i guess pancakes are deceiving
Anyone else watch these videos when you're on a diet to stop you from craving food? Works like a charm every time!
Glad you went to bonzies
The guy who brought out the pancakes has a Robert Englund kinda vibe to him 🤣🤣🤣
Waitress really fascinated by you she even drops the tea towel😂
I didn't think he'd have any problems eating those pancakes and other things 🤘
Holy cow-no way 🤘
I think she likes you
The lass who works theres a 10 god damn
She wanted you....
Animal in a zoo had me laughing.
I love this channel funny, dirty and rude lol
😂😂😂😂 I laughed so hard at the end when you’re quoting the hecklers.
The only thing this would give me is diareah for atleast 3 days.
"We don't mess about" lmfao
Other required items are not pancakes so very deceptive and not very fair
real life Sayian right there!!
0:01 This voice you've been doing is killing me lol. is it based off something/one or something that you've come up with out of the ether?
The flapjack challenge. 😂🥞😁👍
No maple syrup?
Note: Biscoff cookies actually have the name “Lotus” on them
Dude I just found your channel. You seems like a nice person. I honestly giggling when watching you. Also Amusing how you can "store" that much of a food. Cheers from Hungary.
Is it just me or was the chick slightly flirting ? :)
16 pancakes and all the fixings in a half hour does sound like quite the challenge, especially with how long this one took on its own. Definitely would have mixed the marshmallows into the coffee though.
I’m convinced for the amount of food you can stuff into your gullet that you must be inhuman, it blows my mind how much food you can’t chow down just be careful my friend, I’m no doctor but if by chance you are human  I can’t imagine doing this for years on end won’t cause health problems at some point down the road. Take care of yourself my friend I know you probably won’t see this comment with all the attention you get but I wanted to post anyway. Thank you for the entertainment you give is all you have a rare superpower for sure lol I wish you best of luck on your future projects endeavors we are all rooting for you! Be safe and keep doing the impossible
😂is it just me or does it seem some challenges look bigger when they know Adams coming? Like those biscuits , marshmallow s fruit? Eh?
Destination Unknown….. Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho…….
ruby soho is also a wrestler!
Now that’s what you call a friendly service.
It’s just a wafer thin mint…😂
I just want to know your workout schedule to get rid of all these calories? Are you just genetically blessed? Do you run 50 km after this?
I once ate blueberry fruit snacks and my poop turned green. 😂 lol
very friendly people
- I feel like animal In zoo - you look like one It was rude and quite offensive
This lady was loving you
Your dad joke game is strong! 🤣😂❤
I can’t  have one of these pancakes. But, 16 of them. and the brownie milkshake and cookies. Wtf, I’ll stick to crepes 🤣🤣🤣
I just wish I could eat pancakes with my hands lol
🙂👍
@12:32 The decent thing to do is bring him a clean raspberry and blueberry from the kitchen instead of the floor.
I always love the videos, and your quirkiness and corny jokes always get me. I always forget to “Like” videos, but you always say Somethings that I consider funny that makes me remember to pause and actually “like”. the video. In this particular video that happened more than a few times. I’ve watched other food challenge videos, and you are the most entertaining by far. That chick that keeps trying to beat Your challenges, just doesn’t have the camera presence and entertainment value that you perceive. I love your work man. Sincerely, a chubby beer drinker who can only eat half a pancake 😅
8:28 I find it kinda funny that he blew on some cold blueberries 😂
Top man
He has to bulimic somewhere outside the restaurant a few lbs of vomit can be found 🤮
This made me to want pancakes
Nice job🎉🎉yummy 😋 have a good day and night positive vibes 😎☕️☕️🥞
I wonder always how this guy don't gains any weight like fr HOW
Those pancakes 🥞 😊
I'd lick it if i had to. My mind went right in the gutter on that lol 😁
Have you ever not finished??? Just curious 😅
That brownie looks good.
Will you compete in the July 4 Nathan’s hotdog contest?
floor cam again
i have watched this guy for a while has he and his girl broken up bc they was always together
I was so sure he would add the fruit or marshmallows to his pancake tacos. I was wrong
Awesome!! You give respect to food....  And not wasting any food good keep it up
I love pancakes but they put me to sleep. That much syrup and I'd be asleep for 3 days....
This reminds me of that episode of Review.  This is certainly an upsetting amount of pancakes.
I love it at the beginning Beard wonders if discussing his dental hygiene is appropriate conversation for the table and then 20 minutes later he’s talking about the color of his poo 😂😂😂😂
Mr beard l always look forward to watching your videos and I hope one day l will meet you and get a picture with you stay strong 💪 and keep them coming 😊
Beard you are very funny
Go to Africa, and do a food challenge
Best channel I have ever found.
After the Texas pancake challenge, I thought you’d never touch another pancake.
Stop talking and eat!
stop wasting so much paper towel.
less talking, more eating.
Hey Beard 👋 just saw this video today, I would have ordered a side of bacon 🥓😋 or blood pudding for dessert 🍨num  num!!  Greetings from B.C. Celina  XOXO 🍍🍍🍍
Same here Beard take my blueberries with honey and porridge  Very healthy
8:53  😂 😂😂 😂😂😂 Effn hilarious man!
Good one man! My girlfriend uses 1/2 a cup of maple sirup (real one we're Canadian) to eat 2 pancakes. Image how much gallons she would need for all of these?! 😂
What a legend you really are ❤
The plate isn't ideal for this challenge
I'm gobsmacked! I live in Brid and I had no idea there were any eating challenges here.
Are you interested in doing a traditional Indian thali made by my gf who is an amazing cook she's from India!? It's massive !!
WYB?
This woman in the restaurant was pretty flirty 😬
Why are you so rude to people??????
Ruby Soho Coffee...never knew an AEW wrestler had their own coffee company. 😆
So what's his strategy?  He doesn't eat for ~24-36 hours prior to these
Crazy this one is in my town little Bridlington 😂😎
Mr. Creasote… “fetch me a bucket”
i love that freaking song!
No dessert 🤔🤔
Woohoo shoutout for Rancid. Well done,Beard!
Fuck a waitressday day
They had a similar challenge on Regular Show.
If Mrs. Beard ever watches this video, she's going to kick your butt! Every one of those " big men" choke before they finish. They can't get that food past the fat belly. Skinny guys seem to expand better.
The croissants were originally from Vienna!  During the Turkish siege of Vienna, the Turks attempted to tunnel under the walls but were discovered by some Viennese bakers who sounded the alarm and the attempt was defeated. The bakers then created a crescent-shaped pastry that was copied by the French.  It became more popular!  Croissant translates to crescent; a Muslim symbol created from one of the phases of the moon!
Love the Dad pun!! 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
Good thing you got a face bib aka beard
Just 20 years ago "I watch you all the time!" Would have been a statement taken very differently 😂
I can't believe you got through that!  My teeth were hurting just watching you eat those marshmallows...ugh.😬
do a vid on how you keep slim around these videos ?
That was insane! Great work Chap!
Every episode I suffer just watching. Makes me feel like I never want to eat a bite of food ever again. And yet I just can't stop watching. Car accident material.
Workers here were an absolute vibe - looks a great cafe
YUMMY,  DELICIOUS.
Have you ever done just a Biscoff challenge? How many of those do you think you could eat?
Love you even more for the Rancid awareness
Well I hate to be you baby going to be stuck on the toilet at least 2 hours
Damn how many poses that lady do for you LOOOLZ def was feeling it. Anyways dunno how you do it but awesome!
Was this one harder than the Texas challenge?
👌👌👌👍................ I have to ASK! having watched dozens of these vlogs up to just. Not seen a fail yet! Has there been one?
Imagine people talking about how you died because of pancakes 🥞
One thing I wonder about, even if you beat a challenge and the meal is free...do you leave a tip?
Well done, my workmate introduced me to your videos and now I'm obsessed , busy playing catch up 😁
I just had pancakes 2 min ago and now i get reccomended this what the
When I was about 7 or 8 I went to a Bob Evans in Kentucky and smashed 8 pancakes in a stack with whipped cream on them and blueberries in the cream. I definitely regretted it later at home.
And here I am eating one cupcake and feel my blood pressure spike lol
Holy Crap on a Cracker!!
I have become completely addicted to your videos... And I don't even know how I came across the vidoes🤷‍♂️ But now! I am watching them every evening... Keep them coming👍🎩
Skip to 3 minutes
I like pancakes but not in that quantity. My goto flapjacks are mashed banana and some nutmeg in the pancake and then top with peanut butter and some of my own homemade real maple syrup. So moist and delicious.
That look you have the blueberry when it rolled away right after fetching that escaped mallow! Bahahaha🤨😒
I laughed too hard at that plaque joke 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
As a chef, it would be so fun to cook you a meal. 😂
i feel a diabetes song coming up next
Would love to see you test blood glucose after a sweet, or savory meal. I'm betting you achieve 240
The plaque joke was spot on
I think it's so lovely how everyone just loves to see Adam when he's out and about. Fab video, brilliant banter with the lovely staff. My new favourite channel. Have an awesome 2023 love from Hartlepool lol. Julie 🌟
Why is the place so empty? The echoing sound of your voice is eerie. No crowd support, no confused by-passers, just you and the staff. Bit of a downer in terms of atmosphere.
Just a man eating pancakes. So wholesome. Great channel
And out come the wolves...
16 PANCAKE
Destinatioooooooooooon unoknown!
I don't get how you managed to finish this one but couldn't that pancake one back in the US. This one just looked so much bigger!
They need to stop their blabbing and let him eat. Just saying it got a bit annoying
haha u like decent music
Big fan from Philippines
Destination Unknown. Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho.
I like the idea of a whole glass of Gaviscon waiting!!
09:40 my man snuck a peek
What’s for dessert? 😂😂
Love dentist story. Casually, without rush, while doing a challenge. 🤣
Syrup is one of the hardest things to get out of a beard
This is a great inflation tool. Eat for free!
That skinny waitress is sexually harassing this man with her eyes.
(old chap busted @9:35) 🤣
"Destination Unknown" Challenge
The camera on the edge of the table making me cringe lmao
Dude ,   Its so much fun watching you nail down eating records from all over the place  !   Hat`s off to ya my friend  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pancakes are your kryptonite lately.
I watched the texas pancake challenge first which i thought you had in the bag but  It still feels like redemption watching this though 😂
Dude , you couldn't eat 8 pancakes and now your demolishing that
“I never win anything” - Literally wins hundreds of challenges yearly.
Pancakes are a difficult volume food. Scott's breakfast burrito...large flour tortilla...add maple syrup. Top with a pancake, add scrambled eggs, bacon, gammon, pork sausage, gravy.  Wrap it up as a burrito. Boner Apple Queef.
That much sugar? I'll bet you were climbing the walls for a week!
Has this guy ever lost a challenge?
Could have done that in 15 mins if he'd just stfu 🤦
Why does he film the floor ?
Now I want a t shirt with "I'd lick it if I had to" on it 🤣
who the hell eats marshmallows with pancakes
that waitress wants to smash
“16 pancakes are ye mad ye gunna kill sum1” got me
That happened to me an I thought I was dying 🤦🏿‍♂️😆😆 blueberry bandit Over here
9:40 it's a natural reaction
If it took beard 25 minutes to do the challenge you know it's impossible for us layman.
Dude wins every single time he steps in a restaurant to declare "I never won anything". I bet he's pro poker channel somewhere on the net.
This is a channel I’ve found at 3am YouTube watch and now I’m subscribed and watch all the videos
How does the food go down there's no chewing involved
Am I the only one who thought giving him the cranberry or w/e off the floor was disrespectful? Idk he knew it was on the floor obviously, coulda got him a fresh one 😂
Have it saved to my phone..Ruby Soho by Rancid. Great track as far as pop/punk goes.
I don’t think they’re bootlegs I think they have a new label on the Biscoff or imprint rather
Let’s create a GoFundMe for Beard’s parking tickets!
" You do look a bit like one " stupid people don't think before speaking
Server was a baddie
I can tell you don’t like these people lmfao
Let’s be honest here… everyone is wondering what size of shit this fine gentlemen has on the bowl
@BeardMeatsFood "I said dramatic, you don't have to shout" 😅😅
You make it look so EASY
Not only challenging the food record but also the parking meter & beat them both. 🤣 Insane! 👏👏🏻👏🏼👏🏽👏🏾👏🏿
"I never win anything" ... whilst taking down his nteenth food challenge and winning another Tshirt! LOL
How does this bozo rate 1.4M views for this crap?
He must puke after these.
They should rename it the BeardMeatsFood Champion Challenge. Who can beat your time xD
I'm a huge fan and I met her I am talking about this there's actually a professional wrestler she's good too called Ruby Soho
There is something so lovely and wholesome about you and your partner too! Love you both!
Love me some pancakes
That waitress was fire.. the food looked good too 😂
Hooooooossskkaaaadooootttt
Quality again
I'm Betting  his shitt is the biggest in the world
That looked good
"You're gonna need more syrup!"
Cosa ti vale cucinare a casa ?
That was IMPRESSIVE!
Beard just ... Beards it.   Other than asking for desert menu ...
Happy Thanksgiving Everyone!!!))) 2022
Somehow I found you today by accident and have to say I can’t stop watching your videos I’m really amazed at how much you can eat. Very entertaining also you have the best sense of humor what a fantastic guy you are. I need to ask about I see you travel to a lot of interesting places and I’m sure some are really small towns it seems but my question is do you get a chance to enjoy the towns or city’s you travel to. If you ever make it to Chicago I would love to know and see it in person and shake the hand of my new hero hahahahahaha. Really all in all this has to be some of the best videos I’ve got the chance to enjoy and it’s not just because how much you can eat it’s also the great sense of humor you have about it. Thankyou very much for some great entertainment. Best of luck to you always.
Another great one but. Can you get that waitresses number for me please. Wow was she hot or what!
Black poop is a sign of internal bleeding.....
Amazing work!! DAAAAM! Could you get through it quicker if you filled them with ice cream and strawberries?
Enough carbs for a food coma longer than Rip Van Winkle.
Adam, fella: jet black poo is a symptom of internal bleeding. You might want to get that checked. Just sayin'.
This guy is just cool not to watch
Unbelievable 😳 this one looked deadly! 🇮🇪
My favorite food I can't eat, auto 👍
Desperate or can she not leave him alone lol
How come he is not overweight?
The beard Man 🎉🎉🎉🎉is undefeated
I love me some good pancakes
Darn it.... I laughed at his "plaque" joke.
hmmm that place is awfully empty
great challenge! I always love a good stack of pancakes, add some chocolate chips with a thick syrup and I’m in heaven!!
I'm really curious how something like this is even possible. How can you stretch your stomach that much? I eat like 3 pancakes and I want to die from being overly full.
8:15 his face when the blueberry falls lmfao
Love that you know Rancid 🤪😄
I just started watching his videos. If he finishes this I will subscribe...
god I love that wooden slab they serve it on! Want one!
My mum lived in brid for the last 19 years of her life and I tried the pancake challenge fair to say I managed 9 and the banana. Well done beard MOT
Well done Adam!!!! We go to Bridlington every year so will have to pop into there for pancakes!
We theorize food is swallowed/blended in a "stomach", then deposited/squeezed through an "intestine" ?   👽
At least I hope it was the blueberry's 😂
If you really want to see a bunch of mobility scooters, go to any Wal-Mart in America.
Adam great job 👍
Dude! this beauty liked you. 🤟
It's funny, people actually thinking they could out do you or even just giving crap that you should eat desert too. There has been only 1 video of yours where I thought I might actually have "A CHANCE" at completing it within the time limit but only just, when you've beaten it by a lot. I am also 6'4" and was close to 300 pounds at the time. I am still the same height (HAHA), but have recently lost 65 pounds and know I couldn't go close to beating it anymore. I am over half way to my goal weight with less than 40 pounds left to lose.
the plaque thing actually made me laugh
What’s for dessert
For the love of god, get a Cameraman!
Remember God is watching you boy. Love from Ray.
I don't know how or why I got here, but I'm here now and I'm so happy I am.
You'd need insulin after that - that feed will fry the linings of your blood vessels! ...that a jillion grams of carb LOL.
That looked yummy and impossible to do, but again u show otherwise
Sugar challenge
That old boy when that lass drops towel 😭😭 😳
What was the pink stuff?
Can't believe you did not get a ticket, that council is brutal in issuing them 🤣
This is the first challenge that I would certainly finish, if it weren't for the marshmellows, hate those. Still Pancakes, can't go wrong there.
feed me some plss from Philippines 💯🍰
Had to go listen to Ruby Soho after that.  Loved this song back in the day.  Nice job.
"Well that was a misguided choice of legwear."                      THE LEGEND HIMSELF
THE WAITRESS WAS SO IMPRESSED!
IMPOSSIBLE PANCAKE CHALLENGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This one is makin' me so hungry. Given that I'm a pig, I'm pretty certain I could eat 1/4 of this humongus pile of delicacies. Beard is just from another galaxy.

🇰🇷   진짜 대단하십니다^^

Okay.. ever seen ‘Cool Hand Luke’? You know what I’m gonna ask… “..ain’t nobody can eat fifty eggs.” “My boy, Luke can..”
Thanks for making my day everytime I watch. Building a challenge in your honor in Wisconsin. Good day you sweet bastard!
My Ma in law used to turn up on the front door uninvited just as I had settled myself down in front of the TV to watch the match with beer in hand. She never got the hint either even when I ignored her, incessant chatter nightmare
"I would Lick it if I had to."  Now THAT'S a T-Shirt. lol.
Appreciate the Rancid reference and the great effort to find royalty free music that sounded super similar to Ruby Soho! Love your videos
How the hell do you do this skinny as a rail ?
How do you stave off diabetes?
I would be pissed if someone tried to have an ongoing conversation with me during a challenge, and especially while eating. I mean give me some space would you, I'm eating? But this guy, cool, calm and collected - and nailing the challenge while being social and polite. Wow.
GLUTTONY ......
Marshmallows???? Sorry never had that with my pancakes! I think they threw those in to make it harder!
the waitress was kinda cute haha
why did they have to bring it out on a slab of wood like its a flintstones cartoon?!🤣
The waitress is smoke show
how do you eat so much, that’s a genuine question I want to start eating more but I just never can’t and you just ate a whole family meal in 30 minutes.
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho!!
Loved the Rancid reference!
Discusting!
pancakes looks amazin, the waitress too
Marshmallows yuk!
Is no-one going to talk about the owners tight denim shirts or what? That’s a lot of pancakes Adam and “other” stuff. Great spot and vid. Glad the syrup made a showing as that could get dry really quickly
He stores half of the food in his beard. Slight of hand.
These contests are over in the first 2 minutes. Then he BS's his way to the finish line.
"A plaque...get it?" After a half second delay while my little pea brain processed it, I actually snort laughed.
I have caught up watching all ur videos. I just can’t believe how u do it. Woohoo. 🙌🙌🙌🙌
The idea that they didnt go in the back and get you one blueberry and one raspberry fresh instead of picking it up off the floor and making you eat those ones was a little inconsiderate honestly..Great job tho brother..
Was that a glass of Pepto Bismal.
Randomly, in hindsight magically, popped up and now I'm looking forward to "bindge" every new episode 🤭 I've seen every video and rewatched a lot lmao) Love the (recent) American trips! Nice positive vibes you spread with the world. Greetings from the Netherlands 🤗  "OouessKaDoess!" No clue how to spell the beast yell🤣
👍 WTH? Have you had some sort of surgery to be able to eat like you do? Honestly, I can't believe anyone can eat like you do without some type of assistance. ✌
I follow all his videos, he must be in world guinness records, i dont know how he still alive :-)  lol amazing..
👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
Love the content. Would be awesome to run into ya, don’t get out much so it’d definitely be a memory.
Coffee with sugar 😆 🤣
What you call a croissant is an Austrian pastry called the kipferl that was created in the shape of a crescent to celebrate the victory over the Ottomans.  Croissant is the francophone name for a kipferl.  Regarding anglophone pronunciations of French words would you try “filet.”
okay now get a divorce and eat 30 pancakes.
"I never win anything" Says the guy who has an entire career dedicated to beating food challenges where he routinely wins.
Eating lots for nothing & getting payed for viewing hmm 🤔 not bad ..
I got three cavities just watching you eat all that sugar.
Not me, looking around trying to figure out what’s beeping for like 3 minutes cuz I missed the part where you said it was your alarm 😂😂
Love this don't know why,maybe it's because when I was young I thought I could eat all that but never could .
"Is that from the kids menu" That got me!
That was too easy Mr. BEARD!! LOL  JUST kidding!..you did it pretty quick! Good job..love watching u.
Them pancakes did look amazing though.
Ruby Soho is a wrestler in AEW
Easy! One thing I noticed while watching the last couple of your videos Beard, when you drink something, it reminds me of that video of Donald Trump awkwardly drinking from the water bottle. Weird I know. Anyway, great job!
Hand embroidery T-Shirt! Nice!
😂😂😂 watching you like a wild animal! 😂😂😂 Her response 😂
Medical Medium look at his wild blueberry podcast. He’s doing a big wild blueberry challenge right now.  Wild blue berries release and grab heavy metals in the brain 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼.  The seizures medical medium in his books tells how metals in the brain along with dehydration and high fats cause  seizures  Good on you loving them!!!!
hey you reading this, now's your chance to go listen to rancid if u havent. they're important, u wont regret it <3
not anymore the impossible pancake challenge🤣🤣
How does he not soil himself... he ordered a coffee as well like wtf... his stools must have the fattest girth.
Not gonna lie I'd buy that T-Shirt .... "I'd lick it if I had to" ..  hahaha
I bet he had a serious headache afterwards
Eating enough food to feed 5 people, that's called gluttony.
I never seen this on my recommended but I already liked and subscribed

I read somewhere that you and you girlfriend  have split up. Hope you are  keeping okay.
Also the name of a aew wrestler
Think the waitress had eyes for Mr Beard...
I like how you have slowed the videos down and engaging with a lot of conversation. Especially in this one and the next (Texas one with the granola bar). Great content sir.
I think the waitress was a little smitten with you beardy man.
The fact its named after a Rancid song just mde it that much cooler!
Hello Diabetes
Watching your videos to try distract my self from my  tooth infection x
....Half Price Wills....for when that challenge finishes you!
You do amazing things.  But, Dude, Beard, seriously, how many times have you had to steam clean your car from a lost lunch experience on the drive home?  *possible sub-channel for the sick and twisted*
4:09 30 what now?
How many extra likes for Rancid on the clip Destination Unknown Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho
My favourite moments - when you force a lot in your mouth and do the pained cartman face 😣
They need to change the name of the challenge to the “fairly improbable pancake challenge” 😂
Hey bro, just wonderin,... why do u never have ads on your videos? I think your content is super clean... i just hope you making lots of money causs your videos are awesome
I’ve seen Rancid, supporting Green Day at Hyde Park 👍🏻
I hope you have a nice bathroom, because I am sure you spend a fair amount of time in there
Please stop speeding up the video 😭, I simply love your channel and want to watch all of it, which aren't that long in regular speed anyway because you're so fast ☺️🥰
Rancid!! 🤘🏻
A couple thoughts on this one: (1)Those pancakes look amazing. (2)”I would lick it if I had to” should be the title of Adam’s book.
5:52
This would've been really Inception like if you would've been in Ruby Soho's doing the challenge, while listening to Ruby Soho, & watching AEW's Ruby Soho matches! She also got the bands permission & uses the song as her entrance theme! But another Great Job Beard!
Don't know about the other regular Joe's here but I'm good for like 7. Bottomless pancakes at IHOP always gets money worth.
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho ❤
These ain't no IHOP pancakes.  Blood sugar - 319.  🥞🍮🍰😱
You've been kinda rude to the countdown guy 🤷🏼‍♂️
My wife said this is some 80s porno music 🤣
DESTINATION UUUUKNOWN RUBY RUBY RUBY RUBY SOHOOOOO
i eat to much blueberries one time it turned my poop jet black 😂😂
dream challenge
I mean it might kill someone from a diabetic shock
why you doing it,you say?cuz you get money from vids...is why,ya aint got a real job,thats it.
Man I wish I could do this one with you!!  Pancakes are my favorite breakfast food. I don’t think I could finish it, but I would give it my best my bearded brother.
Hi Adam, when will you be putting a video up from the Mountain Air pub at Tredegar in South Wales?
What footy team do you support beard?
13:25 the lengths people go to for marketing
talking about sex jokes and the loo when eating food, welcome to Britain
glad he said 16, not SIXTY
nah mate blackpool is by far the mobility scooter capital it is incredible.
I love you beard subscribed for ages you are a gem to watch bro quality entertainment
In the beard meets food dictionary 'impossible" means 'snack'.
French sympathizer, lol
Can't believe he made him eat it off the floor ugh
Too bad that waitress dropped her towel and did not bother to chuck it and clean her hands. That says nothing good about the food you ate.
those aren't pancakes, those are unappetising American "pancakes" ;)
9:43 gramps couldn’t help himself 😂😂😂
After finishing a challenge, has any of the creators ever asked you how they can make it more challenging so other future takers won’t or can’t beat it?
Well done sir!!!  After about 2 or 3 pancakes that size I'd be done, trying to inhale carbs that size would do me in. 😁
you know, Adam, the funniest thing about your videos isn't watching. It's listening to your narrative. I had to change my diaper. YOU LONG HAIRED GIT!!😂
Kids menu grifter
Something-something seaside? lol LOVE the vid! GO BEARD!!!!
I really hope his Pancreas doesn't burn out.
holy crap someone knows about rancid!? i dont feel alone anymore :')
2nd worse idea ever was drinking water should have drank milk or ice cream lol.
Hey Pal can you check your email l left you 2 messages thanks man
That looked like a tough one. I had the pancake sweats just watching.
Damn the managers at that spot was super pickey, lol picking up a raspberry of the ground making sure you didn't miss that is ridiculous.I would've told them them to go to hell with all of that pickinesss.
a monster))
As if you were in Bridlington. I only I’ve N Scarborough if I had known I would have come to meet you!!
Just stumbled upon your channel a few days ago and I've been hooked!   Any chance you'd ever make a video going over how you manage to stay healthy while chowing down all this glorious food/what your workout routine is [if you have one?]
Well done again mate ..but that guy making you eat the raspberry n blueberry off the floors another level..a character ..I think you mean a total ******
I'm convinced you have a black hole stomach!!!
Great scoffing beardmeatsfood. The miniscule partments were a sorry state from the staff member trying to render you a failure. You best defeated this challenge though.
How do you not have diabetes or high blood pressure with all of the sugar and sodium you consume?
I’m always SO impressed just has polite and nice Mr. Beard is regardless of scenario or the welcome/attitude of staff. Really love seeing that especially in modern times.
“I never win anything” besides every food challenge you set out to do lol
Mrs. Beard mom jokes, shots fired, lol
Watching anyone else eat this amount of food would gross me out. But Adam is a pleasure to watch. Come over to the states and visit Yosemite ( with me).
I dont know what it is... I just struggle to watch sweet challenges... 🤷‍♀️ I wanna see meat 😉😂
Dude, when the waitress is telling you "you have to lick it clean" and "he's absolutely smashing it" - she's NOT talking about the darned food...
So few people will get the rancid saying. Great song and great band. Hope you know OPERATION IVY……yes??
"Is that from the kid's menu?" If you ask me all posh restaurants sell desserts that look like they're kids' menu portions.
Brilliant. Respect the beard!
Legend
Smashed it! Those pancakes were a decent size too
Hostess looked fit.
dude ..... just how do you do that and why are you not a fat f--ker ! love your videos !
Check behind that beard. How much food can that beard hold?
Diabeetus
This was overboard with sweetness badly
This is nothing. I watched Forrest MacNeil eat 30 pancakes in one sitting and he's not even a competitive eater. He's a life reviewer and a damn fine one at that.
SALTED carame; brownie but says wants something with salt in it lol
Do a big John Chinese order
Let me guess: He eats all the food.
This is the first time I thought the challenge was way too much. Pancake taste is good but I feel it gets old way too quickly to get rid of fucking 16!
I dont know whats worse, beards dad jokes or the fact I got it before he re iterated it xD
I'd like to try this one.
Quality rancid shout out great band
fun but truly impossible. idk if anyone who isn’t a top pro eater would even get through half, so it’s like a one off… unless molly visits from the usa or something.
Weldone mate.
the black coffee was a good idea
"DESTINATION UNKNOWN... .... "
for future reference i'd much prefer hearing about your oral hygiene rather than what color your poop looks like while watching your videos
People who do food challenges are in the same league as the sad bastards who think eating really spicy things is cool. What really takes the insufferable prick to the next level is making a beard part of your personality and branding. Is there anything more first world privileged than driving round consuming more food than you need for free and getting paid to do it through your youtube. How did i get here from watching humanitarian videos of starving children in South Sudan.
Hey man Love your shows But what do you think about loosing the cap and cutting the hair? Not a teenager anymore.
that looked really tasty but i was skeeved when your woman dropped the bar rag on the floor and just picked it up and continued on and then the guy picked up the blueberry and raspberry off the floor and gave them to you to eat. good god that's awful restaurant hygiene .
The Achilles heel- sugar! Was expecting you to ask for the savoury menu at the end. Good job!
hollw crap thats a lot of sugar ..lmao so what did ya get for winning ..diabetes  thank you ..lmao   great job man
he is smart by doing challenges bc he gets free food + making money by ppl watch he is so big brain
That's enough to feed 10 grown men! Holy crap, this guy is something else!
I never thought I would see you do a video in my home town. Great to see keep it up 👍
2 yearly… isn’t that every 6 months?
"I would lick it, if I had too" - surely the title of your next song? 🤣🤣🤣
"most impressive thing she's witnessed" that's so sweet.. Absolutely love your reply.
1:30... Damn, that place needs to wash their floors.
“I would lick it if I had to” has gotten me more than two dates.
More importantly did you get the waitresses's number? ;)
We indians invites to eat full family Hyderabad chicken biryani that's real challenge 😂😂
i missed you i live there aghhhhh i was at work noooooooooooo
Love the vids but I can see you could wipe your face the same with less napkin. Always a lot in every vid. 🧻
Mrs beard better watch out that waitress has Adam in her sights
Need to find a good 8 or 10 pound Jellie Eel challenge,  Jellie Eels deserve the respect and love .
Man that looks like a binded up week or 2 week colon blocker .
been waiting for ya to come to brid, shithole to live in tho ahaha
Think I've got a sugar high from just watching this
Never drank the strawberry milkshake on the front of the table. Big Fail I'm afraid.
I wouldn't have been surprised if he ordered another set for dessert
Wot..?
Serious question. Do you ever vomit afterward? I just don’t understand how your digestive system handles this abuse.
2:58 😂💀 Beard ain’t have to do her like that lol
0:20 I’m glad I’m not the only one who thought of Rancid lol
Impossible? Im skinny but damn i could eat those pancakes right now they look amazing
The obvious question through all this is obviously - What happens 24-30 hours later?
ahh shit this girl was absolutely mesmerized by you 😅
Biscuits yo
I love giant decorated cookies and donuts. ... I'm actually under weight too .
Girl in the black looked fire!🔥
They callED it the impossible pancake challenge haha.
Looks delicious!!
Been watching for a while and you smash the average challenge for the average man, don’t get me wrong, your banter and seeing new places is always a laugh but I feel that if any challenges longer than 20 minutes are a doddle for you, lad!   Gonna need to be a chef taking the complete p*ss to really test you!   Keep doing what you do though, dude! Yorkshire for the win! 👍
Love the Rancid track and call out
I have mascara all over my face from crying laughing  at the image in my head of your dad and the the deckchair situation. 😂😂😂
Been watching you for months and I've just realised I'm not even subscribed. WOW. Mistake corrected! Also, gg.
"After a while, you just want something with salt in it."  How are you enjoying our salted caramel brownie sir?
Death awaits.
As a bearded man myself I appreciate the clean beard compliment. I don't know how you do it.
Good sports
Pancake challenges appear to be some of the most difficult. All that starch!  The flavor fatigue.  Nice.
Great work as usual, but correct me if I'm wrong that you didn't utter your two catchphrases.  Please give the people what they want and include those!!! 😁
So  before watching....  *David Attenborough Voice* They called it imposssible but there was one beard. Let see us now the beard in his natural environment as he stalks his prey. It is a prelude for the ritual coming home to his mate mrs beard. After she has checked his credit cards to see if he has to pay for them, she decides whether he can sleep on the couch in the basement or in bed. Let's all observe together whether it's a bed or a couch for this magnificent specimen *End David Attenborough Voice* now i can wtach
Bro you are my hero
Beard is a proper nerd, but he’s great to watch
"sixteen pooncaaaasyyykes*
Adam i just wanna say you come along way my friend went from 300k/400k views to 3m🎉
I can't believe you was in Bridlington and I didn't see you 🤦🤦🤦 gutted
That waitress sure liked Beard IMO....
I find a bag of lays chips to be competitive enough for me...
Aye mate,took yur time with this one eye
What lovely staff. It looked yummy but ridiculously large!
And sugar level is 500 😂 after all that diabetes
Where was the “uut sca doo?”. Is that how it is said?
Do they have a Dessert menu? 😂🤣😂
it was nice of them to include a glass of Pepto Bismol for the impending heartburn.  Great job as always Beard <3
Adam me and my little boy watch you every night and he was very disappointed you didn't do your usual intro noise before doing pancake challenge, I did it instead but he wasn't impressed  lol please don't forget next time save my embarrassment lol
I know that song it appears in my playlist one’s in a while
I would lick it if I had to....har har. ...would look good on a tee shirt 👍
Ruby soho. Also the name of my old hooker 😂
Hiiii
'Ruby Soho' doesn't sound like the name for a café, more like a second rate stripper....
Maybe just maybe if the smoke was really really good and I hadn't eatten in a day or two and my last meal was not so solid, yet filling so it stretched my stomach but digested super quickly leaving my now empty stomach stretched, & drained. Because u gonna have the squirts until its all out, when it breaks down so quickly😆  👍 & then id smoke some more👍
I dare you to go to whataburger and try to eat like 12 of the new chili frito burgers bet you can't do 5 of them
All that money to have your stomach expansion is really paying off🤑 lol. Bet you spend the better part of ur time conditioning your stomach eating primarily certain things such as whole grapes  🍇   Ur not naturally like this are you, I mean without any conditioning at all or any botched operations or natural irregularities that caused your stomach to be abnormally large?
Cracking mate, you sure made that look a piece of pan....cake
Where was the cheesecake man?
You must've lived a sheltered life was on point.
Good day sir, I really dig your videos. I heard you say in one video that this music might be a little too hard for this place, this early in the morning, you then mentioned the band Alkaline Trio. I have started listening to Alkaline Trio and I like their sound, but they are not too hard for any place at any time. Keep up the solid work
Sister Beard needs a come back
You probably won’t see this comment Adam but I saw Lindsey in the shop near my house today ( I didn’t say hello I was too nervous ) but I couldn’t believe it !! Love you both keep up the great videos
I love the Rancid reference!
Jeez, are they all burnt?
Wonder how much the calories are?
It drove me nuts at the end when he took a minute to wipe his beard instead of just finishing one lone blueberry lmao crushed the whole thing tho
What's " Sister Beards" name!? She is lovely   was watching you both  at Bella Italia earlier! Love your videos/ challenges!!
I managed to eat one bagel and 2 slices of toast whilst he ate that whole challenge 🤣🤣
i would eat 2 of them and be full for 5 hours straight
That’s a big hefty plank they’re using as a plate. I wonder how many they have. It would make a good chopping  board. Ps well done Beardy
Stop promoting irresponsible eating!
She definitely wanted to take Mrs Beard's place...
Would be nice to see the wall of fames in the vid's :) (if the restaurants have them)
I feel like I'm in love with that lady from the cafe
Nice job you can put the food away for sure. Have you ever lost a challenge.
As an original Goth I am in now hopelessly love with the stunningly elegant and beautiful Goth lady, despite her fleeting appearance. For clarity I mean Goth in the sense of the Sisters of Mercy, I'm not a member of a Germanic tribe from around 400AD. Although I am Danish.
I've eaten at some pancake places where it seemed like a food challenge even though it wasn't intended to be.  The portions at some of these places are insane.  It's not difficult for something like this to turn into a very tough challenge.  But good oral hygiene is definitely something to be proud of.  Good job.  On my last dentist visit, it was pretty funny.  They were questioning whether they should even bother with a fluoride treatment.  It's been about 40 years since I have had a cavity.  The enamel on my teeth is almost impenetrable.  But bad teeth can cause a lot of health problems.  So, it's really important to take good care of them.
How does this not send you into a diabetic coma?
I'm diabetic. My glucose went up just watching this episode!
Sugar really..! 🥴
Another awesome food challenge Adam.    Well done and see you on the next one
New invention... panwiches!
India. Cambodia. Sudan. Etc.
Im so glad you referenced Rancid! I did it at the same time as you bloke
Pancakes look way too thick, would make me feel sick eating a couple of those
Do the Harold and Kumar White Castle order challenge please…
I am deep in. You are fucking awesome. THIS one. hell yeah so proud. FUCK YES
Adam that woman wanted your phone number and a date! Great video and wonderful banter!
I don't know how you do it.  Just damn!
I still think it's a missed opportunity not to have an update later on.  I knew a guy once who ate so many Mars bars for a bet he hallucinated.
Here’s a thought to ponder.  A Kit Kat is made of other Kit Kats. So how was the first Kit Kat made without a Kit Kat? Same as snickers… the insides of a snickers are others snickers…. Please tell me how they created the first snickers bar without a snickers bar… The mind boggles…..
If he keeps going like this he'll eat all the food in the world....  Another thought : Can we see your shirt collection🙏🏾
I would certainly die if i were to forced to eat that much sugar. I get headache just eating few grams of indian sweets.
guy has insane humour, and the lady is nice and beautiful.. Honestly to type of places i like to go to eat
It would be a much more enjoyable  video if you'd  stop your week jokes and just did the  challenge
brits are weird !
I'd lick it if I have to good t-shirt 👍
I don't know how you do it. I only have like three pancakes, half the size, and I can't eat another bite.
9:39 Old man couldn't resist turning round for a peek 😂
Good Morning, Mr. Heart Attack. 🤣
Please post your blood work! cholesterol levels, etc
😱😳👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🏆
“I went to the dentist yesterday” 😂😂😂😂
I don't know how much money you make or if you are rich or poor. But I do know that I have never seen you pay for a meal!
Is that a glass of pepto sitting on the corner of the table?
Top
30 WHAT ??!
You should eat all the protein first. 🤣😂
"probably because i never win anything" meanwhile wins multiple food challenges every month lol
Pancakes are super filling nice work pal Aunt Jemima woul❤D be.  Proud
Sweet mother of pancakes that was humongous 😳 I'd have been hijacking a mobility scooter after that
8:28 did you just blew to cool down your blueberrys? :D
The real ones know that wasn’t a joke lol.. at first
Competitive eaters blow me away like one punch man does everytime he kills a strong opponent. "How the hell are you that much more than everyone else"
ECHOES OF GRAVY!!!
This thing should be called diabetes on a plate.
Wow the advertisement was absolutely awful  but besides that excellent work cheers made
Yo beard! I´m now getting lean, maybe even shredded (we'll see) for the first time in years after having binged your videos. Works way better than those fitness or weight loss videos. Thanks man! Keep it up!
The waitress was pretty impressed 😉
Looks good. Although that certainly won't help reduce plaque levels in his arteries. Blood pressure I'm also sure was going high after that meal.
This really does look impossible. Insane. I didn’t think he was getting this one done, bravo big guy. Bravo!
It would be scary to see you stoned out your gourd with the munchies lmao 🤣 🎉
Mc Donald's wants $4.10 for a milkshake! That's TOO MUCH!
That's the 1st thing that came to mind when you said Ruby Soho. I could hear the song playing in my head
Just for bringing up the Dentist they should of given you GARLIC BREAD!!!🤥
Adam needs to try Swedish pancakes! He could probably chow down 200 of them bad boys!
A real man would drink milk with pancakes
These eating videos are the least exciting videos I watch but I don't know why I watch every single one of them from the beginning to the end. I feel good after watching them.
What still cracks me up is how on earth did your da rip his toe nail clean off on tbe deck chair, left me in awe calculating the angles the speed of the open the trajectory of the unflip, anyways Nailed this one brother...🧐
i just wanna see him lose 1... just 1 damn challenge, so i can be sure hes human
The commentary on this one had me crackin up
So. Much. Sugar.
I'd have to have some of the pancakes drenched only in butter to give a break from the relentless sweetness. Unless the pancakes were sweet already, which I wouldn't want. To me, proper buttermilk pancakes are savory and the sweetness comes from syrups and such.
8:34 gotta watch out with blueberries, one time I ate too many and my pee turned red! That was like 3 months ago and it’s still red, funny how things work 🤣.
“Plaque” …. haha
Incredible Adam! Love the videos all of them  talking with the staff and people especially when the staff knows you always puts some pressure.  Buddy was mad at the end he said it's not impossible anymore. He was surprised himself
It's still not how you pronounce "croissant", though.
5 minutes to spare and you had a full conversation while doing it. next level.
@:20 DESTINATIIIIOOOOOOON!
You should've drank what was left of the syrup as the final coup de grace lol.  Amazing job as always man.
Ooooh, Syrup and Beards don't mix. I know first hand.
When you going to come to United States and do challenges in Texas or California?
Some places you go are pretty shitty. I just cannot imagine the state of how the food is cooked
I like how you casually talk while you should be in a hurry
The "plaque" joke is very underrated
I'm sorry however I have to say this. You are like the Fidel Castro of the UK as Fidel Castro is to CUBA, THE BEARD ROCKS.
I laughed harder than I should of at the marshmallow chocking hazard bit
When the drone was in the air I had a picture in my head of your beard all fanned out like the flying nun and Mrs beard hanging onto your ankles going to the challenge. Soft landing and softer pancakes, cheers Cameron.
She said lick it clean ....did that mean the box to? 😂
When are you coming to California, Beard?
Really dude he picked it up off the floor so you could win it🤮
tht would of filled u up well done beard man
That was a  impossible  Challenge....Awesome job Beard  you are Amazing 🎉
Pancakes are the worst! I remember a restaurant many years ago that had the most awesome breakfast ... everything was made to order but unlimited. A lot of people made the mistake of starting with pancakes that filled your stomach up quickly (and CHEAPLY), but the locals knew enough to understand you could get a week's worth of protein in eggs, sausage, bacon, etc., and leave the pancakes for a finale.
30 Nicker... God do I love proper English folk.
I've never heard of rancid what band is that
Leave it to Beard to talk about his dentist trip and his poops in the same video! lmfao
Used to go to Bridlington on holiday loved that wee place
13:03 It's hard for me to fathom how someone can eat so much.  Do you have a hot rock at home you curl up on to help digest?
those are not pancakes... pancakes should be thin
Now thats what you can call a desert, but now, when do the main course arrive. 😅😊
Adam use your bloody manners - "could I possibly have a black coffee"..... PLEASE! also where's my round of aplause, come off a bit rude sometimes mate
Not gonna Lie, those dad jokes keep me coming back every week!
"I never win anything".........mmmmhhhhhmmmmm...... I see that t-shirt collection.
Love your videos, didn’t like weird guitar music in this one though🙄,. Keep up the good work!
Broooo ..when u said Ruby's Soho....I said quece the Rancid reference! Destination Unknownnn
Yeah eat this from off the floor its clean after we walked on it most of the morning
Wowsers!
Your turds have to be frickin huge! Especially if you down some Metamucil just before! 👍🏈🤣
Looked like there was a glass of Gaviscon on the table throughout the whole thing. :-)
lemon juice m8
I laughed out loud at the story about your dad…how do dads always pull things like that off doing such an activity?
My kids know you as Tardis bearded man, which makes me equally proud they're complete nerds and know my favourite youtuber
Last time I ate a plate of fat pancakes I had to use a knife & fork. Such a drag
DAD JOKES OF THE CHART
No food challenges where I am except spicy challenges
you should put the black coffee in the shake
Rancid , My first true music love! Blasting them daily since the early 90s! gdamn getting old!
off all the challenges you've done, this is the first one I've said "hell no I'd never attempt that"    that amount of sugar alone, god damn. Fucking marshmallows? I guess.
greetings from maryland💙
"Pancakes! Pancakes! PANCAKES!" - Cabin Fever
LOL at an Englishman grousing about how Americans pronounces croissant. As if the English have some moral high ground on pronouncing foreign words. Let's hear your take on taco, tortilla, and pasta, to start.
What about the pink drink??
How the hell does he keep so thin with all this calorie intake?!
"Destination unknown!!..."
Well done Adam
And how many days calorie allowance was that?
STOP TALKING!!!!!
how strong do you feel lifting after these feast days?!
Wat een vreselijke dikke pannekoeken,  ik hou van de dunne Hollandse pannekoeken
How long were you in the ceiling from that sugar high?
Where did they drag that T shirt from? Looks like it was yesterday's work shirt 🤣🤣✌🏻✌🏻🇬🇧🇬🇧 awesome videos
great video Adam those were the thickest pancakes ive ever seen
Nice video but I'm wondering if you could have finished it faster if there wasn't some cheeky waitress flirting with you. 😂
After hundreds if not thousands of videos how can you still not manage to no eat like a savage. Clean it up man 😂
Most days I feel sorry for Mrs. Beard. Mostly because women lose fat when they are happy and she is very puggy. 😪😒😪😒 posting pre watching the vlob. I do love her new hair, which means she is benefiting from your success-ish. Does she stress eat in private?
You should try the Kasespatzle challenge at Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas
that lady is pretty cool
You may watch bob ross when u eat, but I watch you. Watching you scoff massive plates of food helps me with my ED (Eating disorder). Let's get it, keep smashing it mate
Makes you have an existential crisis
Ruby Soho is also the name of a female wrestler in AEW
There seems to be alot of breakfast challenges as of late.   Also this one looked pretty good!
I saw that meal and laught and thought this is a cake walk
Love your t-shirt. Really fitting for this challenge. Keep up the good work!
What's a Blondie?
When beard said “this banana comes in handy for mopping up the debris” and he’s replied that’s what I thought, that’s why if put them on there.  Course you did mate! Talk so much bollocks 😅
No whipped cream?
He brings style, entertainment, humor, authentic flow , and fun to his profession. I enjoy his videos a lot
Well done! Made it look easy!  Northerners haven't shown themselves in best light though in some of these challenges.   Beard "You're making me feel a bit like an animal in a zoo in that you're just looking at me." Waitress "You do look a bit like one so..." (and I'll keep on being rude and stare at you) Pretty out of order. Take the hint waiters and waitresses and give Beard a bit of solitude. Well done Beard!
Jeesus... just looking at that my diabetes went up a notch
Rancid - great off-beat music. Love it.
The eye candy made this video extra enjoyable.
30 WHAT?!?!?
Love pancakes and maple syrup… I would demolish them 16 pancakes easy not sure about the rest of it though.
Needs more alkaline trio.
Wow I had doubts with this one. All that sugar made my stomach hurt just watching.  Nicely done
Ahhh the OL banana Squeegee - SMASHED IT
AFI t-shirts and didn’t miss the rancid link, he’s taste is music is as good as his taste in food
Casually breezes over jet black poop talk but second guesses talking about oral hygiene. We are more alike than I thought.
Call me crazy (okay you're crazy), but I feel like beard could have gone home with that lovely young lady behind the counter.....
I think Im in love with the waitress, oh also, nice job beard.
Is that a glass of pepto to go with it 😂
I am Sorry to Say.. But...Black Poop = Blood in about 50% of the Reasons for Black Poop the Other 50% is Food that is Black like Charcoal or Blood pudding. Blueberry do not Color your Poop Black! ^^ time for a Dr.! :P good Luck! it will be a Camera into Your Rear Moment to Clear stuff like that!
I bet your sugar level was an about 800 after eating that 😅Mr. beard
You should ask for a cheese sandwich after these type of food challenges! Might cut the sweet!
Wouldn't recommend going to Brid beach after this, the seagulls might smell all the pancakes.
Do you order a main course after a desert challenge?
They have to rename it now.
Have you ever eaten something and found that u weren't recording or the memory card got corrupted or something?
No desert?!! Challenge faild!!! Nice vid Beard. Thank you for the laughs!
"She was lime 16 pancakes, are yer mad, yer gonna kill someone!" 🤣 I laughed so much
I was scared of those pancakes, there were lots of them and they were thick!!
Congratulations Adam!👏👏👏👏👏Pancakes are tough! You took it down fairly well.👍👍👍👍👍
Wonder what the calorie count was for that. Roughly 6k I think
What happened to the BMF introductory banner?
Adam, aren't you worried about getting diabetes? Dumping that amount of sugar into your self must play havoc with your insulin. You have a superhuman digestive system I know. Hope to god it doesn't bite you on the arse later. I'm type 2, I had a sweet tooth all my life. Just watching that put me in a coma LOL
I want pancakes now!
those are some pretty serious pancakes. looks awesome
"It turned my poop jetblack".    Damit I was eating Man XD
My pancreas shut down just watching this.
She dropped the rag on the floor and picked it back up and rubbed her hands with it. Did she use this to clean off other tables?
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby sohooo
I'm  so glad you're getting the recognition you deserve!
Good job. She was eying you up 😊
DUDE! I love me some Rancid.
Diabeetus
Well, challenges are a nice way to get free food, aren't they? 😂
Abum. You are pretty important in the ED community. Eating disorder. ED? I will check back with the erectile disorder community and see what they think.
For some reason I wanted to hear beard say I love the smell of pancakes in the morning!! I don't know why but I really thought he'd say it lol
Algorithm
Hey cool throw back for mentioning rancid haven't heard from that band in yonks!!!! Oh and we'll done on the challenge as usual!!
"I would lick it if I had too" Name of your sex tape.
She's a lovely bird.
That plaque joke actually made me laugh.
Hey Beard, usual great post old chap. You usually have a sweet after a savoury challenge but I wondered why you don't have something savoury after a big sweet challenge like that?
Oh why do they serve food on massive slabs of wood or pieces of slate whereby the food falls off 🙄
What a lovely couple
If you crave a sweet dessert after the heavy starch or salt do you have to have the salt after eating all that sugar.
There's always a little bit extra at the  end of the video worth waiting for, it's like watching a marvel film 😂
This is literally insane
Cameras watch times on parking, don't count your brownies just yet!!! another nice vid. What a job....(I'm retired, so no job!)
Well done see you on the next one 👊
I hope he went and vomited after this challenge. All that sugar in his body would be brutal.
Please let me know if there are any plans in the future to come to Boston Massachusetts. If you need anyone to help research places that offer food challenges I would be very happy to do the legwork for you.
Destination unknown, Ruby, Ruby Ruby, Ruby Soho...
New title... 'They CALLED it the impossible pancake challenge...' :)
Dude, Ruby Soho by Rancid. Now THAT brings back memories... 🤣
Ive said it before and I'll say it again...Beard is such a charming lad
Love how easy you make it look by demolishing the time but talking through most of it too 😂😂 love the vids
Love some Rancid
Nothings impossible for Beard. Their were so many great toppings for the pancakes. Challenge looked so good.
"I would lick it if I had to" had me almost spitting out my coffee! 😂
Plaque. Get it? Ha. Its always nice to see the driving up to the place and meeting some locals... good thing theres subtitles too
There must have been enough energy consumed in this particular challenge to power a small nuclear reactor. Do you run it off in a similar fashion like the Flash?
I think that lovely, young lady, fancied you, Beard.
Here's your applause 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😁. Well done sir !.👍🏼
Watching this video two things came to my mind: diabetes and your wife's mood
Great entertainment and another win to boot, well played Beard. Staff sounded like really nice people from the convo's.
normally,I don't think I could do this,but at the moment I'm quite drunk,so I'd go balls in and hope for the best.
I'm curious as to what your cardio routine is for combatting the high calorie count.
great mate! but... please... stop asking for a round of applause..
Lol used to listen to Rancid incessantly when I was a teen. Good humored dude you are.
Ugh, pancakes are the worst!  They fill me up SO fast!
Pass the blueberry syrup and get the fuck out of my way.
Dude that hurt my stomach just watching it.  Pancakes are brutal.
Well done Mr.Beard! :)  A bit of history : The first verified evidence of the croissant in France is due to a baker named August Zang. Zang had an upscale patisserie in Paris in the early 1800s, named the Boulangerie Viennoise after his native Vienna and serving many of their famous treats — including kipferl.
So close to my hometown of sunny Scarborough!! Wouldn't recommend visiting 😂
The Amount Of Views N So Little Time IS CRWAYYYYYYY C 🦾
I love pancakes!  That Raspberry sauce looks delicious!
11:41 Beard eating a salted caramel brownie "Is it wrong that I want a corned beef sandwich or steak and ale pie: something with salt in it!" Er, I think the salted caramel brownie does contain some salt ;)
COAISSANT
"That's a joke, I would totally lick it" ohhhhh now we see how you got the Mrs. Sorry 😆. There's no way nobody else went there. Another amazing video.
Damn, those are some really slim people, in a very elegant, graceful way.
"I would lick it if I had to"...I'd buy that shirt immediately
This was a great video. I agree though - even as someone who has a sweet tooth you get to the point of having sugary things that it almost like "No More". Fun Fact Ruby Soho is also the name of an American Pro Wrestler, and she uses the song as her entrance music. Great content as always, and agreed that guy was Mrs. Beard 2.0, but for a challenge, it seemed only fitting - leave no doubt right? Cheers man, have a great day.
Where about in Oklahoma? My home state
they made him eat the stuff falling on the ground ? 4 what ? ...tzzz
Pooping black can also mean internal bleeding but it probably was the blue berries if you didn't pass out / die.
Great job ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Omg I can’t help get frustrated - if u stopped extensively whipping ur beard before eating that last blueberry ud finish so much faster !!
Anyone else disappointed he didn't ask for a dessert menu after the challenge?
Those pancakes do look pretty rancid tbh.
So amazing !!! :)
Good luck
Good day beard
What? No catchprase this time??!!
Well done, don’t understand the deserts in a breakfast challenge 🤪 also like the comments at the end after the music to get us to stay till the very end! You’re an eating machine!
Looks like they threw away the cakes and gave you the pans.
Bangin' as always! And +1 for the rancid-esque ruby soho intro! "Destinationnnnnnnn unnnnnnnnnknown"
U don't just eat dry pancakes with syrups make some sandwiches or cones with the cream and toppings, even looks dry
Anyone else wondering what that glass of pepto (pink) colored liquid was in the front left? Good job Adam, look forward to seeing what Oklahoma has in store for you.
Watching you use 10 feet of paper towel to wipe your hands and beard 2 or 3 times was absolutely painful.
He’s the Uk version of Man Vs. Food
Wow. You must have Prince Rupert Drop levels of internal stresses after that one. Incredible.
If you were in the zoo what would be the sign on your cage?
You should ring up the landscaping phone number and say "but i was only parked there for 5 minutes......."
Did you ask if they had a dessert menu, I must have missed that🤣
Lmao Adam just having a casual conversation during an "impossible" challenge 😂😂😂
Looks good. I think I’ll take 2 pancakes please
Love every challenge,   but damn you’ve been putting up insane numbers on your videos recently 🤘🏽
That last blueberry was like the "wafer thin" thin mint from Monty Python. Then fat man explodes lol
Pig god is real
Nice IKEA plants in the back hehehee
Holy hyperglycemia batman!
Yes Bridlington! Arh the childhood memories ❤️ Mobility scooter capital of the world 🤣
"I would lick it if I had to" could make a great title for your biography
Metal! 🤘 🔥🎸🔥
Ruby Soho is also a wrestler in AEW.
Watching this makes me want 🥞 I've never been a fan of meringue, but I do like macaroons. I thought to myself, "He's going to want something salty after this.
I wonder how many people try these challenges after? When the businesses offer for free and see him bowl in with his camera they must be devastated
The one time you actually need a pile of salty fries!!! 🍟🍟🍟
Lol! The FIRST thing I was thinking of when you said the name of the restaurant was Rancid's 'Ruby Soho'!
I think you just replaced Paul Bunyon in eating pancakes and out bearded him too.
The plaque joke was awesome and the banana made a good mop for the crumbs. That challenge was huge and not a lot of time. Straight crushed it. Was fun to watch. Great video
Perhaps you're not chewing enough!
HES BACKKKKK
Great to see a sweet challenge 😍😍 would love to see a giant bowl of porridge breakfast challenge too!
Nice Frank Miller reference
I thought that pink candle in a glass was a large Pepto-Bismol, which thinking about it would be a funny thing to add to the end of a challenge.
The plaque joke was worth the watch alone :-o
She seems pretty flirty and might a bit interested for real, must be sad when she found out about Mrs. Beard lol
Improbable Pancake Challenge
04:23 Adam, in the middle of a challenge: You know, I went to the dentist yesterday...  Her reaction was our reaction.
What's for dessert? 😂😂😂😂😂 I'll see myself out! 🙈
Did they have a dessert menu? You forgot to ask.
just saying before I watch this, I dont think you'll do it
Great job doing the "impossible" Beard!!  Don't know how you can down so much sugar so quickly and not be wired up!.   Keep 'em coming!!  Always a good laugh  or two somewhere in your vids!
You should ask after eating this have you got a main menu?
Why does the word Sploshing spring to mind when watching this?
What do you eat a normal day? And what kind of sport do you practice? I would like to follow your life style, I find mine boring and depressive.
You chatted to much kak during this
Great, now I'm stuck with that song for the rest of the day...Could be worse, though 😄
"I WOULD LICK IT IF I HAD TO" should be on a t-shirt 🤣
What is the pink stuff in that little glass at 5:30 ?
I love Bridlington.
Did the waiter just pull up a single berry that rolled to the floor and put it back on his plate? jeez.
The days the people eyeballed this man holding a camera in the street are long gone! Sir Beard is famous now!!
I love the little look he gave the camera when the guy picked that berry off the floor! Is he actually going to make me eat that ffs 😂
There should be a Bread challenge where the food amount is doubled 😆
How he doesn’t suffer hyperglycemia is a marvel.  Insulin production in high-gear.
does he throw it up after?
Was that your Mrs. Beard impression at the beginning? You almost have it down.
I've said it before. I'll say it again! You're a madman!! As if the sugar wasn't enough to keep you up for a week, you do even more from the caffeine in the coffee. Nice win
Actually didn't expect you to finish this one
So Beard you're saying that table is like Mrs Beard 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That looks so damn good!
Should have said, 'Do you have any bacon rolls' for after the challenge.
More like the diabetes challenge
You should be sponsorised by Adidas "Impossible is nothing"
ruby, ruby, ruby, ruby soho  -rancid
now the possible pancake challenge ;) possible for some ;)
Impossible 🤣🤣🤣
can i just say, r/wewantplates
There's two things a man needs in life for sure a good mechanic and a good dentist. 📡👽🇺🇸 RUN!!!
The challenge would be better in the town of Chillingbourne.
Coincidence or not but I'm rocking my Rancid and out come the wolves shirt today... To make it even freakier that's exactly the album Ruby Soho is on.   He's singin and she's there to lend a hand He's seen his name on the marquee but she will never understand Once again he's leavin' and she's there with a tear in her eye Embraces with a warm gesture it's time, time to say goodbye
Don't let the health department see that!
Great song..... Ruby Soho.....
“I never win anything!” Proceeds to win T-shirt. 😊
Finishes a sugary challenge... "Have you got a savoury menu?" :-)
I feel like Mrs Beard wouldn't like this episode. Waitress was definitely being flirty 🤣
Smashes 98% of food challenges taken and says "I never win anything" 🤣 gtfo
Dam lol. You make these look so easy
Usually poop going jet black is caused by ferrous sulfate ( iron pills ) , eating charcoal products , but not blueberries , I lived on a blueberry farm and it never got that dark …  but not a fan of blueberries much anymore !!
The croissant is actually austrian
Most will just get diabetes half way through….
I love your videos man, my cousin just passed away here at my home, he was like my brother, loved him to death. Your videos always uplift me and bring me joy, looking forward to your next challenge.
When the inevitable happens with some negative health issue arises due to the massive over eating, will it be documented? It's the side of reality TV eaters that's hushed away.
Love the beard growing on the beard
Most simple ugly t shirt😢
Ive been watching these videos since back in the day, the amount of views you get now are amazing. The best part is you have succeeded by just completely being yourself. top lad!
Thats just like my breakfast every morning. Take about 10 minutes for me to eat it all. Even with Beans 🤤
I still remembered the first time I saw your videos it was in your apartment Chinese takeout at night a couple of foil trays with tons of Chinese takeout you looked wrecked after that was about 7 years ago or so ahhhh good times well for me hahahaha 🤣
Good luck Adam!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So, this is retribution for your dad's toenail? Lol.
12:33 That knobhead trying to be funny with the berries on the floor.
That dropped Biscoff biscuit pinged my OCD xD
Good on ya, mate. Still, I'm mainly here for the impeccable humour.
5 seconds  into this im looking at my smoke detectors lol
"1 hour max parking..should be enough right?"😂😂😂👏🏾
that's a lot of sugar :O
After that I'd go home and puke my guts up, and take a six hour nap.
♥Ruby Soho!! :D (both me and you are showing our age!)
ASSURDO
Destination unknown!  Good Job Adam!
I would call this challenge "impossible NOT to get diabetes"
The waitress is cute 🙂
Beard, we're all very proud of your dental hygiene. Beard meets dentist.
What an amazing episode and to beat the impossible again is amazing but when you come out with the line “I’ll lick it if I have too” you gotta feel sorry for Mrs Beard 😂
The pancakes in the thumbnail look beautiful
Wow ... glucose overload ...
On a lot of your videos .. I think (wrongly) maybe I could do that....but not with this. Those things magically expand in your stomach after you've eaten them. How on earth did you do this bro 🤷
I have watched probably all your vids and your so entertaining. Here is an idea. Wear a continual glusose monitor . Would love to see your insulin reaction to a meal such as this.
The background music was SO CLOSE to Rancid's song, but far enough away you won't get demontised. I know you struggle a bit with eating mushrooms, but the sight of those marshmallows makes me want to fetch my load. Yuck.
Yaaay, something not a full English breakfast.
I always become hungry for whatever food you're eating. But then by the end of the video I'm like, nah, full now, not feeling so good, don't want that. And I haven't eaten anything.
Never win anything you say? You win allllllll the time beard ❤
day 2 of asking BeardMeatsFood to do a challenge, get the reaction, and in the same sitting order it again, eat it again, then get the reaction again.
Half expected you to order a portion of salty chips as desert
that pancake platter looks like it'd be very nice to share with some 2-3 friends
iLL TEACH YOU  A LESSON WHEN IM SPREADING THOSE MAN BUNS <3
Just clocked that even during BST your videos said Thursday and Sunday 7pm GMT in the outtro.. Videos we want to see 1) Manchester Chicken burger day of eating 2) xmas specials day of eating (chains) 3) xmas market eats vlog
That girl wanted him 😂😂
Beard should have asked for some bacon and eggs for dessert. It would have tasted so good after all the sugar.
dont mind me, just wanted to comment how stunning that waitress was... oh and good job on the challenge i guess.
You should ask for the savoury menu at the end of one of these.
How long do you stop eating after a meal like that?
Well done in smashing the pancake challenge. At least you don't have to worry about sweet dessert in this challenge.
If you want to beat the beard. Just make it a "No Yummi" challenge. If you describe anything as "Yummi" you are out.
Just spotted the biscuits. Fook.
Great going. I'm new to your channel. Not seen you lose yet. have you ever failed?
Melted butter, or it ain’t happening
English bragging about teeth is like American bragging about not having guns.
Fear the beard ✌🏼
Do viewers visit these cafes/restaurants after you’ve done them? Do the owners ever contact you after to let you know? Does business go up? Just curious. Wish I could visit all these places, but alas, I live in Australia.
"Do you have a mains menu?"
love the punk and ska references you stick in.. Love from South Africa
Watch your page here in New Zealand.Not sure if there's any places with challenges like you have done here.
The waitress liked YOU! Shh, don't tell Mrs. B. Well done again!
Shame it wasn't Rancid. They're amazing live!
That waitress was cuuuuute
Must say Adam I enjoy watching ur videos mate
Delicious. But the wooden board needs a rethink…
Not going to lie. That one made me drool a bit...
I reckon that female server wanted a piece. She seemed very flirty.
Destination unknown!
thanks for putting on the high cut filter and playing Ruby soho in the background... suck a good song and had me grooving and singing along :)
Die-ah-bee-tus!
I actually appreciate the insight about your teeth lol I have always wondered how you managed to keep your teeth so healthy and well. Happy to hear that you are your dentist best patient.
"I would lick it if I have to"  That's a t-shirt right there, your face with that line
That looked rough, well done mate.
>Mobility scooter capital of the world.  Bet after eating that thing you wished you had one.
I can’t believe he didn’t ask for the dessert menu 😂
I love that it doesn't take a half an hour to get into eating, getting it done, kicking ass and on to the next one!  Watching your channel is so enjoyable, you are a clean and polite eater and always get the audience and staff to get involved and enjoy it with you.
Annnnnd now I need pancakes.
Me, a regular sweets lover: That looks doable🧐
the thing with the blueberry is right ... i see it everytime by my 4 y old daughter!
Sorry pal everyone knows benidorm in th mobility scooter capital of the world ;)
I'm ashamed to say................ I laughed at the "Plaque Joke" 😆😆😆 Well done Beardy! That looked tough. Made my teeth hurt just watching it! 😣😬💪🏻
A UK restaurant named after a British sounding song  name from a Californian band.  If this is globalism I'm here for it.
Ruby,  ruby, ruby soho... love that song...
Someone liked you.
1:14 Odd observation.. Do you, in the UK, give the finger-grip handshake? Is it common?
I would have ordered a pork chop for dessert😊👉🍻
Came earlier to work this morning, put early breakfast on my table and guess what I'm watching :D
Incredible stuff man hats off 😯
11:20 looks like a glass of Pepto Bismol on the left...probably not a bad idea after this.
“I would lick it if I had to” needs to be on a t-shirt 😂
It was the blueberries or internal bleeding. Only reasons i can think of. Let's hope it was the blueberries. It would be fun to see how much hospital food you could stuff into yourself though :)
Good food and great company. Great effort Beardy!
2 and I would be knackered
Well done for pushing through. That looked unbearably sweet. Those pancakes disappeared impressively fast.  From a tactical point would it have been more efficient/ effective to take a scoop of something sweet between each pancake or would it have made it worse?
Interesting challenge, but why do you have such a stupid look in your thumbnail?
That cannot be good for you. I wouldn’t do it even if i could.
Great to see Adam know's his classic songs
This is my dream food challenge!
I was waiting for the "ok, now do you have a desert menu" lol
A cafe named after A aew wrester cool 😊
Black coat, black shoes, black hat, Cadillac.
Plaque...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I am in the dental field and I loved the oral health talk. I watch a few other channels like yours and often wonder their oral care routines are and what state their teeth and gums are in.
BEARD DAY!!! BEARD DAY!!! BEARD DAY!!! Looks delicious but my diabetes wouldn't let me eat much. I love blueberries as well.
I’m coming to England in December! I’d love to try a challenge with you 🤝🥺
Pancakes can be risky.   Some go down easy, and some grow inside your stomach.
It’s amazing beard doesn’t have a kid considering the caliber of dad jokes… “ plaque get it”😂
This should be called the "Sweet Death Challenge " 😁😁😁
LETS GET IT!!!! 💪💪💪
Place looks sick!
That thing that happened to your poop with the blue berries happened to me the other day except with red velvet cake. I thought I was dying....
Do you have the entree menu?
Destination unknown Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho
The shirt....it is all about that shirt!
This activity cannot be healthy, I guess.
i don't understand how the body can process that much sugar
u realize this is extremely unhealthy dude, lol not a habit u wanna keep up as u get older
Adam! You’re the man mate! Thanks for the upload, Sunday football and a beard video! Perfect 😊stay safe mate
The expression on your face when you dropped that blueberry finished me 🤣 😂 😆
I love you Beard.
So casual about it. Absolute boss.
"I never win anything" ...except I beat food challenges every week
I still love playing that old song
I wonder how many viewers regularly stay for the post-guitar... like... 2sec bit.
love this channel !!
Where's the butter for the pancakes??? Love ya, from Southeast Texas 🥰😍🤩😘
Food challenge is the main event, but the parking challenge is becoming a favourite extra feature :D
I think he hides it all in his beard for later.
She liked you dude.
Ruby Soho is a professional wrestler who uses Rancid as her current theme song as well.
These might be my favorite owners.  Lots of fun.
You are an absolute machine Sir, well done! Thank You for doing what you do ✊
Great job!! Oh my gosh, all those BIG pancakes + the other sweets!!  And as always, looking good, Mr. B.
Ingesting that much sugar at one time; how do you feel after that?  I can’t even imagine; do you try to throw up?
RANCID!!!
Let’s play along: Two lovers in the distance..
And out come the wolves!
I was not expecting you to say "as long as your endocrine system is functioning" 😂😂 I mean I don't think of you as dumb but I'm a doctor and with a lot of people there's a knowledge gap so that was very funny.
😂😂😂 he thought he had a ticket
The owners are as whacky as you are.. You could form a comedy trio.
Oh Man i loved Rancid lol. you definitely get your fruits in for the day with that platter. good job there good sir.
+1 for the rancid shout-out!
How many pounds of hair you eaten every week ????
Nice Rancid tie in! Not very well know these day by youngsters like you.
Eschtooola!
Yo that was a good one, congrats on another win. That was funny when you said "I said dramatic you don't have to shout." for the countdown.
Two or three pancakes and I'd feel instantly no longer hungry!
👁️
You know these maggot  meals are small fish for you !GATE13SW6CFCCREW
those pancakes look perfectly cooked
Harsh Hallows for you Halloween boy half baked Hallows and beans wiv a cup of cocoa OK ya the GOVERNOR
Adam she's quite fit though bruv !Damn I'd eat quicker to impress her sorry I was rapping !GATE13SW6CFCCREW
“They’re like pancakes, all exciting at first but by the end you’re fucking sick of em.”-Mitch Hedberg
Seven minutes and the 16 pancakes are gone!
💯💯💯💯💯💯
16 pancakes for Mr Beard that's so easy peasy he will ruin in no time 16 pancake challenge well ya name on these all no doubt without blinking !ya KING of THE EATERS SWEAR DOWN !GATE13SW6CFCCREW  You KILL them wiv licks all the time !
Those pancakes looked perfect! I coulda crushed those but the rest of that sugary mess would have folded me
"Do you have a lunch menu?"
Serious question. Have you ever done a challenge where they brought out the food and your first thought was “I may have made a mistake”? Pancake stacks are my nemesis. They just expand so much in my stomach that after the first one I’m stuffed.
Destination unknown...except he did know 😄
Im a bit suprised you didnt just add the brownie to the coffee to cut the sweetness a bit ^.^ GG though beard
I’m curious to what your routine is after you eat such a big meal?
Aight let’s jus say it! Waitress was crushing hard! 😂😂😂She was ready to eat you alive! (See how she mentioned the clean beard?!) 😂😂😂 yeah she was impressed 😂😂😂
DESTINATION UUUUUNKNOWN! greeat video man!
Black beard, black hat, pancakes, Cadillac. The boys a time bomb.
I'd get a week long sickness eating a quarter of this sugar
Awesome to hear you've hear of rancid! They shaped my life!!
Mobility scooter capital of the world?  Have you been to a theme park in Orlando?
I would 100% down those pancakes and blueberries.
has this man ever posted a failed challenge?
I think it would be neat to do a food challenge with the Beard. I know I couldn't hang with him but I bet you would have fun . 🙂
I imagine calling the restroom a restroom to you is an understatement cuz I'm sure you're in there fighting for your life half of the time 💯😂😂
After the full day with Mrs Beard, i need more. Watch every video you put out Adam. From now on, we need more Mrs Beard! Come on we both know she is the master mind behind your sucess. She should have her own channel. love the videos and evreything yall do! Mrs Beard Mrs Beard Mrs Beard!!!!!!!!
Lol, tell me you gotta chance to “impress” that waitress even more later….😂
Your alarm set me dog off, thanks!
honestly thought you lost a tooth when you smiled at 13:17 😅
I loved that you played an instrumental of Ruby Soho.
Assholes making you eat that off the floor, I’d understand if it was a pancake maybe although I’d still offer to make another one
That waitress was a smitten kitten
Hmm. No husker du thingy at the start this vid
I was just in the mood for pancakes. Then I saw this. 16 pancakes! Good heavens. Maybe I'll sit in a corner and have a Vegemite sandwich.
I think it would be hilarious if they called it the Possible Pancake Challenge now.
Anyone else consistently taken aback by Adams ridiculously extensive vocabulary? It’s almost as if he has a masters in English literature or something 😉
Is that tummy or dungeon.! OMG goodness gracious. Usually I will predict before the start of the video wheather you can finish or not after watching your videos for last few months. This challenge I thought you can't finish. You are a monster Adam. For the first time I my guess went wrong. Absolutely amazing.:)
bloody heck, still just got it with all that talking
You did a fantastic job, Mr. Beard.
I think the bird wanted a slice of The Beard!
That was a lot of food bruh. Great job.  And she was HOT too !
“…would be the most impressive thing I’ve seen in my life” “You must have lived a shelter life 😀”  FUCKING BUUUURN. She is now in the back applying Aloe vera ointment
at the start i thought i reckon i could put a good dent in this one, but watching you struggle abit near the end reminded me i have no chance 🤣
at least the cutting board wasn't broken. XD
Love watching, big fan of Rancid as well!
Rancid punk legends
After a sweet challenge, you should ask for an appetizer menu 😂
Im sure that girl was getting a little frisky from watching you down those pancakes.
GATE !GATE13SW6CFCCREW up THE CHELS WORLD CHAMPIONS REMEMBER THAT
I started singing that song as soon as you said the name.
Adam when you was in Canada you said you was GANNA HOOK me up and I said it's a BOT and you replied no it's not it's definitely me please let us know appreciate !GATE13SW6CFCCREW
All right video suggestion first spot you spend $10 second spot 20 third spot 40. And keep doubling it and see how many different restaurants you can get through.
Just recently started watching all of your videos. Love your interactions with the staff at the places you visit. I'm sure you make the day of anyone you meet. Cheers mate! Keep up the great work 👍 👏
And now I’m making pancakes at 9pm. Thanks beard
Beard is that seriously a glass of Pepto???
I think she was attracted to you
It’s not the same without the 2 catchphrases
🐐
Lord those are some perfect looking pancakes
love me some Rancid
Was that a cup of pepto bismol at 8:53? 😂😂😂
I just love the fact that you can do the things I cannot. I hope you live the life you choose. Your wardrobe/attire is spot on. Haters gonna hate.
it seems like that waitress wants you bro
most people are on 6 monthly visits but im on 2 yearly.............
"If you *cry* or if you spit, its over."  *SAVAGE* xD
Delicious 😋 Delicious yummy 😋 yummy 😋 😍 😜 😊 😘
I feel fat watching this. Great job Beard.
Explanation unknown!  Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho!
How? Just how?! Where does it go??!!!
Stellar
You have to show us your trophy t-shirt collection so far?!!! I bet it's crazyyyy
Av told the already. Blueberries make you brainy! Purple food is good for you ( that doesn’t include black pudding)
That’s a sweet one mate ☝🏻
I got diabetes watching this video!
Beard Knows Biscoff
Another challenge smashed best is yet to come I bet
i got diabetes watching this.
Greetings from Serbia, just loving ure videos, naration is absofcklootely awesome.
Expecting you to ask after all that sugar, "do you have any chips?"
The waitress was ready to go!!
I thought the pink cup was pepto bismol until i saw the candle wick 😄
Yorkshire accent is coming out thick here lad. Did you bring some brid rock home for the missus?
Maybe your table-topping dental health is due to not chewing.
16 huge butter milk pancakes! That Mr Beard is impressive, I eat two, and I’m done!   Way too  smash that challenge, always enjoy watching your content.🇨🇦👍
I thought American kids around Halloween had it rough! Awesome job duderino!
Allen, I can’t wait to see your videos. When are you coming back to New Orleans?
Was thinking why haven’t you eaten that pink moose then realised it was a candle
Mos family restaurant in oakville ontario canada  their breakfast challenge is   3 eggs 3 pancakes 3 slices of French toast 3 sausages, 3 slices of bacon 3 slices of ham 3 orders of hash browns. 20 oz. of Coffee or 10 oz. of Juice.      Weight:7lbs/3.2kg Time Limit:90 Minutes
That is the way to eat pancakes . You should try  what we call "saddle blankets". When you one, you will see why. They are  12" wide for starters.
Your videos always make me smile!  And hungry!!  Those pancakes and meringues looked delicious :D
Beard just in casual conversation as he destroys.  The way of the warrior.
Talks a lot during these challenges and he still manages to beat them 😂 I love this though gets a few kicks in their an makes me laugh well done for winning another one
👍🏼👍🏼🇦🇺
Thanks Beard.Happy Sunday :)
at least you got the gob to get it all in lol
Grittier than a Frank Miller book 😂
Should get paddy the baddy on but you must check his cheeks when a challenge is finished as that’s where he stores most of his food 😊
I've no been to the dentist is 4 years lol
Great place! Well done
Dentist story lol
Scumbag move by the guy picking up those pieces of fruit at the end. Sorry the beard murdered your challenge
Comment, what's the point ? Adam wins ! But I liked that it was a local challenge - BRID !
The person who put that ad was smart probably knew who you are and now got millions to see it xd
easy 10K cal lol wow!!!
"The Possible Pancake Challenge"
Well done, the glass of pepto bismol must be optional.
Thumbs up for the plaque pun.
They talked your ear off lol you could of won it in 18 mins
Mrs beard 2.0 was epic
I can safely say I'd never eat that lot that nuch sweet stuff would make me puke, even as a kid I never had a sweet tooth
Of course youre a Rancid fan... we would've probably gotten along great in the pit at all the gigs in Campbell
Beard is my age and hasn't heard the song ruby Soho by rancid.... 😢
Blueberries turned your *what* jet black?? I may have mis-heard but i heard a word starting with C ending with M and a little bit of you in the middle...
8:40 - had a friend make me a red velvet cake.  GOBS of red food colouring.  The next day... red was coming out when I went to do a #2, and I rushed myself to the hospital.  Doctor gets told what's going on, looks at me, and it clicks... "It was probably that, wasn't it..."  Doctor:  Yeah.
Mother fucker getting cocky. I like it 😂
Whats the pinks drink on your table?
Nice little intro. Thanks for the reminder on Rancid. It's been a while since I've heard them. I just saw a recent band photo. My goodness. Time has really passed for the band. It's nice to see the Beard Army out and about. Nice people. The pancakes and associated goodies looked great. Nice win but the true hero here is your Dentist.
Adam is mobbed everywhere
Marshmallows??? Eww, why? Looks delicious minus that. Added to every pancake challenge you go through about a litre of syrup. Amazing.
I love Rancid.
As previously commented… the amount of time spent just with chit chat and not stuffing your face is quite impressive
Mr Beard this time they gave you a mountain of food and a pitcher of shake you are amazing a true champ👌👌⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👍👍👍
The beard,  crushing cakes and cervixes
8:35 fuck yeah bro thats what i want to hear... i know exactly what you mean.. it was the blueberries
I can't do sweets, sorry!
Adam love your videos your so humble and funny. Wow that is a big stack of food a diabetic comma on a tray. Go crush this challenge 🍀🍀👍👏👌❤️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥⭐️🌟🌟🌟🌟
... ... pop !
Music wants me to listen to "Rancid" 😅
If you do dessert challenges, at the end can you ask for a main? That would throw them off!
Should have been impossible. Holy cow that was crazy!
Love the plaque joke. Proper Dad Joke.
The song on the drone shot was perfect after the Rancid mention
Loved the Rancid reference!
"I never win anything" says the man who routinely wins fastest eating competitions
I'm sure I'm not the only one but I'd like to see a separate video on how you prepare for these things. Like how do you not die from all that sugar lol. What's all involved with being able to do this and live to tell the tale let alone have perfect teeth!
Billions starving around the world…. Makes me sad
I can only imagine the crash he had right after this challenge. Fuck that 😂
I think he should talk a little more about the establishments he visits.. especially because he ends up eating for free and makes money ..every little restaurant needs some love and some genuine advertising
I'm amazed that the Pepto bismol candle wasn't required
Ruby Soho is one of my favorite wrestlers
I haven't listened to that song in yeeeeeears!!
This guy is impressive when it comes to making food disappear. He needs to come out to Phoenix Arizona 💯
Ruby, ruby, ruby, ruby soho!!!
oh my. thats not food. that's practicing suicide.
A person with some foresight may have been making some tacos with the all the food there, but Beard is more interested in talking about his teeth.
2:46 Lol, for a second I thought that was a glass of Pepto allready waiting for him.  edit: 8:50 and there I thought he was reaching for it xD
No eeschedewp!?
The sister channel, BeardMeatsFoodAftermath is horrifying indeed.
It just makes me laugh when haters and/or grumpy people make salty comments.....he should have, half of that went into a bag, watching him eat with that beard, drags it out by talking too much.....on and on and on.  For the love!!!!!! Don't visit the channel..... don't watch.... I'm sure you have somewhere else to go and be happy 😁 you deserve it!  😂
Ruby Soho is also a pro wrestler that was gifted the name and song (as her theme) by Rancid as she is a huge fan and they love her. She cried when they gave it to her.
That big chunk of wood was gorgeous
u got her number m8? Very impressive eating skills :)
All those carbs would really swell up inside your stomach.  Sounds really tough. I can't imagine the indigestion the next day.
After watching him I always need to take a dump
Is it kinda an in and out thing? Or are you there a lot longer than you finish the challenge?
Can’t believe you know the rancid song lol
And Out Come The Wolves was my early teens soundtrack!💪
Bit of a coincidence with Beard mentioning his dentist trip, I just went yesterday too. First time in around 14 years. Thought I'd be told I was riddled with cavities, but the guy was like, "Oh your fine, bit of tartar build up though." I went from expecting thousands of dollars in filling and crowns to looking at xrays of healthy teeth going, "Oh. Well that's a bloody relief."
Sugar level 500...R.I.P.  ..wow
Rancid themed pancakes are definitely on my bucket list now. The roots of this place really are radical.
The waitress looked hot???
Don't think myself and three grown friends could handle that challenge. Epic win
Great video, the pancakes look delocious
Well done! My teeth were hurting just looking at all those sweets 😄
Can you do a bit of background for how you got into this. The why and the how. Inspirations and struggles
I laughed at "plaque" a lot harder than I feel I should have.
Beard + Rancid = amazing episode
you know it is a proper breakfast when it is served on a slab of wood!
Rancid!!
A "jet black" story huh. Well, I ate a whole pack of Oreos in one sitting and it made my poop jet black. So there.
Wtg!! When will you return to the states ?? Want to see you live in action !!!
Good job mate, love your videos!...missed the "Let's get it"!  If my blood sugar could handle it, I would really love to do what you do!
“I said dramatic you don’t have to shout” 🤣🤣
Destination unknown, ruby ruby ruby ruby soho!
As a dentist myself, your good teeth might not be so unusual like you might think. When you do challenges, you probably only eat like 1-2 times a day? Yes, it might be high in sugar and other bad stuff, but all the bacteria should be saturated with sugar at a certain point. In the end, the extra sugar doesn't really matter that much, because it cannot be converted to acid because of the oversaturation. Less bad for your teeth at least;) Or you just might have a lot more good bacteria than bad bacteria. As a bonus, you eat everything very fast, so the remineralisation process can start even faster. You thought of everything:p
Named after rancid..RESPECT!!!!
Is an Eton mess not jot just baked egg whites or “a merengue?” As I am I wrong….. fml I have to explain my joke because of regional accents….. my taxi here!
RANCID SHOUT OUT ✊️👊👊✊️👊🥰✊️
I can't believe anyone would act like that is nothing, that is more food than I eat in a week and more sugar than a month outstanding job brother
I think the bowel issues will rectify when normal restrained consumption resumes
Great banter on this video, that waitress was a right sort too!
Take a look at  9:35 time he's a naughty boy!! Lol.
Legend says he asked for a desert menu 🤣😂
Where was the ‘ EEESSHHHHHKKKIIIDDDOOOOO’ ????
I could see Adam as TV host of The Food Challenge Channel  - considering he's a genuinely nice guy, who knows who's watching  with the power to make it happen? More power to you mate, cheers from Christchurch NZ.
that slab needs a bit of a bowl so it can pool up the syrup instead of running off the side.
Maybe should have reversed it and asked for a lunch menu 🤔
Don't go all Mr. Creosote over the blueberry!
It’s so funny just listening to him casually talk and eat like it’s nothing
My 6 year old and I are big fans! He’s been begging me to ask you if you ever choke on your food and how you deal with it if you do. Thanks Beard!
The ingredients list 🤣🤣🤣
I have no idea why, but this is my favourite BMF episode. I don't even care about pancakes much either lol.
That looked like a hard one. The sweet ones always look tricky.
Well done, but that furniture looks so uncomfortable. Just cheap plastic.
What’s is like shitting all that food out of you twice a week? Your plumbing bill must be through the roof !
Oh no.....! Pancakes! The smell is nauseating to me. Surely, I cannot eat more than two. Those look like manhole covers!
Absolutely the most fancy pancake house I’ve ever seen
Gotta love Rancid 🤟🤟
Where are you again? Just to me, strange place I reckon
ALSO a female wrestler with @AEW is named Ruby Soho (who comes out to the Rancid song and knows the band) is a thing lol
those pancakes actually looked really really good
First comment. Ive been through plenty of video's. How about you try a 'sumo' daily diet?
never won anything you win food challenges for a living 😂
There was enough sugar there to keep you awake for a week,can't believe how much there was,the guy sounded gutted when you defeated it,love the vids
Marshmallows?
It's always hard when you're like man I wish I had some chips
I always have a scran during these but your Dads toenail put me clean off
What was the pink glass on the left on the table?
thanks mate i have an eating problem and watching your vidios it make me hungry so thanks and keep it gooing
Well done m8, pancakes are my kryptonite 1 of those buggers I'd be done.
We need an "I'll lick it if I have to " shirt
The Cringe though
This dude is my hero
"You get like halfway and you start thinking : 'What am I doing with my life?' " 🤣 You're being a bloody legend is what you're doing mate!
Dude girl pants?  Lol
Best advertising ever! This is one guy you hope to see come through your door and eat your free food
That waitress is well fit.
I have a fondness for pancakes, especially yeast pancakes that are allowed to rise in the refrigerator over night. But good job Mr. Beard. You and your stomach are a credit to Britain.
Im drinking V8 juice while watching this, just to offset the diabetes Adam is getting from it lmao
At least its a healthy meal with all that fruit 😅
Come to Hervey Bay, in Queensland, Australia. We quite literally have a 'mobility corridor' the whole way down the middle of the town for mobility scooters to tootle along. Every other shops sells them (maybe a slight exaggeration). You'd love it. ;)
You are very inspiring Mr. Beard. From the way you interact with people, your editing skills and filming techniques. Bottom line is, I really think your awesome!
I've seen this man practically eat soup with his hands, and he goes and uses a spoon for blueberries and marshmallows
Week after week I say you talk too much  now I notice other people are commenting on it.  For me I think you should retire as if you have lost that competitive mindset whats the point.  British people don't have that desire to be number one and that's sad but true.  I like ya but you're too lapsidaisical 😞
Q : Will Beard 🧔🏽‍♂️ still ask for the dessert 🍮menu 🤣
Sticking to the 17 minute rule with the last raspberry and blueberry.
man pancakes gotta be the hardest thing to eat a lot of.
I'm waiting for the mushy peas, mushrooms, and chip challenge..........few capers for good measure
I wonder if Adam enjoys the convos while doing his challenges.
Wow sugar overload but very well Beard 🧔‍♀️🤗
I love Rancid! One time I went to their show alone. It was great!
Going to be in Oklahoma? My stomping ground..
Another video that I completely enjoyed Adam. I "think" the only thing that may have made it better was a clearer shot of the waitress. 😄
I hope you will reach 3 million subs!!! ❤
Holy crap, thought I heard the guy say it had to be done in ten minutes. Beard can demolish anything in a half hour, but less by any significant margin is the real challenge.
"If you cry, or you spew, it's over" That's the north, alright :)
I despise burnt pancakes
Absolutely love Ruby Soho by Rancid. Listened so much to that song back in the day and great to see it pop up in a BeardMeatsFood video
This was me when I was 6 years old at my grandma's
I watch BMF for the puns.
Never cease to impress. Beard you are a MF’n beast!!
Devon Larratt would be proud! 💪
I flipping love when the waiters get all into it they give the vid some extra umph
Holy! What a challenge that must have been! Can I know where you got your outro music please? What a riff! Lol Much love from New Brunswick Canada! Moncton has the Classic Burger Challenge btw... 5lb burger + 5lb fries and it is AMAZING! Let me know
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho!
As always great banter , you should have had a corn beef sandwich after to switch it up 😂😂😂
Why is it on a lump of wood FFS? Seriously. I hope you said something. Hopefully they realise how dumb that is too after having to clean syrup off the table.
That was impressive.
Wheres the proper plate man.?.dangerous you bending over.
Its a wonder you wasn't bouncing off the walls with the sugar lol
I’m on a keto diet why is the algorithm torturing me
Come to Las Vegas!!! We have over 25 different food challenges you can choose from within a 25 mile radius!!! Please take a trip here to Las Vegas!
what an ass, picking shit off the floor instead of giving you a fresh piece knowing it was an accident you dropped it and not on purpose
There’s the meat sweats then there’s the sugar sweats lmao
"You do look like one."  LOL!
I love these videos but I come out of them thinking I can eat like a master,lol ...maybe a monster 😂. damn it I’m gonna make pancakes tomorrow morning ❤
Gutted! I used to live in Bridlington and only live about 20 minutes away now, would have loved to come n say hi
Can't believe they served those pancakes on the edge of a board, I was fully expecting the table to get flooded with syrup.
Every time I eat the big breakfast at any restaurant, or homemade, I'm done for the rest of the day
That alarm scares the fuck out of me
I do miss your ' Letsgettit' battle-cry man !
Out of all the cringe worthy binge eating episodes… This one takes the cake thanks to your story about your dad ripping his toe nail clean trying to open a beach chair🎉🎉🎉
Duude!!!! Pancakes will get ya! Nice work!
None of us mere mortals could complete this challenge :)
You’re always good for a laugh beard. Keep up the great content mate
Love that album… and out come the wolves!
"I would Lick it, if I have to" would make a wicked t-shirt mecrch slogan
You need a tshirt with “I’d lick it if I had to” on it now. 😂
She was flirting on you, my dog!
Was that dude on amphetamine or what
I have not thought about the band rancid since 2004
Waitress was kinda hot.
Take an early like for the Rancid reference. From Olympia Wa.
💥🇺🇸👍🏻🇺🇸💥
Right on. Beard wins again. I want to see you get to once spoon of food and you sit there and stare at it. THE Waitress needs her own show, She is a looker. 😇
I love places like this with fun staff. The guy this time was particularly entertaining.
Can we see your T shirt collection? How many T shirts you got
Are they going to rename it the "near impossible" pancake challenge now?
Did you say "I never win anything"?
Crazy Lad 😎
Totally captivated by the beauty of the waitress 😍
"HALF PRICE WILLS"  Something I never considered would be On Sale.
👋👋👏👏👏👏💕🇦🇺
I remember Rancid's Ruby Soho. Catchy tune, it was!  😉
Good on ya smashing that British folks have bad teeth meme
Weekend in hospital, 30 minutes sleep since Friday but can't help but watch the Beard before trying to get some shut eye now I'm home. Great job as always 💪
😋 It looks so good! I could do the pancakes but not sure if I could pull off the milkshake too. People who speak French won't laugh at your pronunciation of croissants.
Word !
I have no idea how you do it man, you really pack it away!!!
Destination Unknown!!
Destination unknown Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Don’t blame you for not asking for dessert on this one 😂.. well done!
A LAMB DONNA IS DESERT
The only thing too turn my poop black is buckfast haha
i am hooked on ur videos   have you ever been turned away frim a challenge?
Had to pause it for about 2 minutes after the bit about your Dad's toenail. Ouch! 😂
"I never win anything" Proceeds to win Challenge after Challenge.
No dessert menu?
been watching for good bit i found this asian girl [gluttony] is her channel she upped you she does it with chopsticks
Lol, after watching a Bunch of your videos I've gotta say one thing.... I'm so sorry for your toilets...I bet you've got Stocks in Scented Candles and Febreeze.
Love your videos always stick around for the marvel-esc post credit scene 😂
To be fair it looked delicious.... I probably wouldn't mind failing it
That certainly is an upsetting number of pancakes.
wheres the beard noise!!!!!!
Well done Adam nice to see you in my home town of Bridlington hope you enjoyed it all my very best Simon 👍
You’ve never been to Benidorm have you!!  Now THATS the mobility scooter capital
When you said Ruby Soho I thought of the Rancid song. I actually just saw them live at the 'end' of the pandemic they played with Dropkick Murphey and Rancid absolutely crushed their set, just like you will these flapjacks (pancakes if ya didn't know)
Great song
"assuming your endocrine system works normally" had me a good chuckle because it reminded me to take insulin for this snack
why not add the toppings to the pancakes ?! lmao
Type 2 Diabetes has entered the chat
You know Rancid? You are cooler now
Should have asked for some bacon! I always ask for bacon when I end up eating too many sweets for breakfast, and it does the trick. Nice salty, crispy, bacon.
find a place that does waffles for a challenge
I always enjoy your videos… you never fail to brighten our day. Thanks for the content and never change who you are because thats what makes you unique 👍
Ifvthe logo said:"Lotus", or "speculoos" they aee probably the oriyinal ones, as Lotus changed the name so it's more appealing to the international eaters
These challenges look amazing but I have a plant-based diet. Does anyone know of any food challenges in the UK that does a vegan-friendly challenge?  To be fair, this one looks mostly vegan but it'd be nice to see if there are other options. Great vid btw!
Watching you on Sundays puts me in a great mood for Monday&gets me through hump day&then luckily there's always Thurs&a new video to get me through the rest of the week...I adore you Adam&I'm so proud of all that you've accomplished since I first started watching you,way back when I was one of the first 75 subscribers🤗...well done my friend...God Bless you&Linds...you crushed this challenge, I'm so impressed as usual✌🏻🧡🙏🏻 btw I feel like it was a little bigger than what it looked like in the pic(the pancakes looked bigger&the portions of fruit even looked bigger🤔)but I'm sure you enjoyed that 11th biscoff cookie😉 Edit: I'm so curious as to how Many grams of sugar is in this thing&how you normally ask for a dessert menu but in this case you would need the savory menu😂
Omg Bridlington, have some dodgy memories there 😂 well done Adam, my teeth were decaying watching that 😂thought you’d smash that 🙌🏼 looking forward to seeing Oklahoma vids 😍 take care and stay safe ✌🏼
Not surprised your Oral hygiene is great... A great workman looks after his tools 😂
Love Brid, my Grandma lives there.
after all my years of watching i have decided that retracting and denying water from a challenge would make things a lot more challenging.
"Biskoff" is actually a commercial bastardization done by the lotus brand of  traditional Belgian "Speculoos" biscuit.
Amazing, you lost me after pancakes
My God amazing I love pancakes and they are very very filling just like waffles. CONGRATULATIONS P.S I would have had to get a doggie bag and took three quarters of them home
If you think Midland is the mobility scooter capital of the world, you've obviously never been to a Wal-Mart in the southern USA.
pls do the pancake challenge at the cabin in sheffield, only 12 pancakes but many many mandatory toppings! I couldnt even eat 2 lol
Well done beard,making the impossible,possible. Another top vid. Looking forward to the Oklahoma series. Let’sgetit!
The waitress wanted the B 🤣
‘Destination…..known’
That waitress was smitten. Definitely impressed by our boy Beard here.
Speaking of shakes, how are you not shaking after all that sugar!?
Grittier than a frank miller book😂
Who else watches the first couple minutes then skips ahead to the last couple minutes?
Exclude the cookies, shake and brownies and that looked like a tasty breakfast! I'd never survive that level of sugar.
Do you have a video on your beard care/routine? I didn't see any in a quick search
Awesome that you know Rancid!! And you’ve also mentioned Slayer before in a video!  I like your taste in music!
Dude that bar girl was into you HARD :D
If it were Bath your car would have been ticketed, towed and impounded by then. Scoundrels. The lot of them.
i love that you openly talk about your poop stories.  lol. its great
I think that would feel like a ton of cement in my stomach!
To much sugar for me👍🎅🏻
The interactions with the waiters and staff is what makes these videos next level to other eat challenge videos.  And beards just a top bloke 👌 👍
After all those pancakes, it's now time to fill the pan with 'cake'!
Absolute legend.
Applause 😂
Americans are like, "My kids have this for breakfast every day."
PANCAKES!!!!
Top man Adam! Didn't doubt you for a second!
so much for the starving in the world
don'tknow about the pancakes, but that girl from the staff... yummy :))
WELL DONE -- THUMBS UP .
This is especially impressive to me. If I eat a couple big pancakes they feel like a cannonball in my belly, I don't know how you do it! Love the sense of humor in your videos and seeing someone amazed by your abilities for the first time is always funny to me!
Destination unknown.Ruby,Ruby,Ruby,IRuby Soho!
He's got a second stomach in his beard, possibily the remains of a siamese twin!
For how often Beard looks out for tickets after challenges, it makes me wonder how often he ends up having to donate to the policeman's ball for the videos.
Do you Floss??..hahaha🙈😝...2 years bro?...what's the magic??
Come on out to hammonton New Jersey next time you’re in the states! We’re blueberry capitol of the world!
That looks harder than any savoury challenge.
Yeah, piece of pancake!!!
Pancakes are so simple but so tasty, great challenge!
Those aren't just sixteen pancakes, those are sixteen HUGE pancakes. Each one of those would equal three pancakes that I eat.
You got me laughing like a squeaky door been opened and closed repeatedly quickly when you called them bootleg biscoffs out
Can I get a Beard Meats food shirt.
Jesus, good job you’re not diabetic.
You SMASHED it Adam now, can we please talk about the waitress 😍
That waitress was flirting hard! LOL Careful, Mrs bread will get you!
Ahhh... 🎶Ruby ruby ruby Soho.  Great song, Rancid are awesome.
Well done Beard!
My maximum would have been one.  Maybe one and a half!  Magnificent effort.  Thank you for the video!
I tried other eaters on YT but Beard is the only one I don't get tired of. Being humble goes a long way.
Its funny how he picks apart what he says and makes jokes
Need a video of the best and worst places you've eaten at and what food was the worst to eat, or a Q and A session with you and Mrs beard
Have to ask, what is that glass of pink liquid?! Looks like Pepto Bismol 😅
Really amazing that the 'pile' of sugar disappeared. Great video as ever. Best Gray
Wow, You made that look so easy, great job!!
"I'll lick it if I have to".  Is that what you say to Mrs. Beard. Sorry, couldn't resist
You mentioned that you eat blue berries everyday. I was wondering, doe it help your digestion or something in particular? or you just like its taste?
Haven't been to a dentist in over 10 years.....
I snorted at the plaque joke.
Love the pancake shirt. Where can I get it? 🥞
Thanks for the vid you have a blessed Soul Adam have a blessed day and blessed life doing what you love and thanks for all you do for us Adam on the 19th my Nephew will be getting Married as soon as I can I want to get shirts would have sooner but money has been tight but I want to be able to get one cause I enjoy your vids and you have a blessed Soul be blessed
Absolutely terrible song.
I think I'm in love with that waitress
plaque man.. i mean pac man has nothing on you!
Just watching that made me crave fish and chips or burgers or anything savoury 😩
U tlk too much man
Appreciate the Rancid style background music.
If you're ever in germany you have to try a giant schnitzel challenge. Would love to see you absolutly obliterate those.
You’re also leading the league in being a complete muppet
Love your work Beard!  Cheers mate!
I wish this guy would talk less. He’s a social leaper and the way he speaks to people is bizarre.
Ruby Soho, any AEW fans out there?
Those burnt pancakes?!   I couldn’t eat 1
Me thinks the waitress had a little sweet spot for our beard there! Team Mrs Beard all the way for me though
That looked like a damn tasty stack 😋🥞  smashed it as usual
hehe actually sitting here watching you munch pancakes while i am munching my own pancakes :D
Took me a minute to.realise that's a candle on the table and not a large glass of Pepto Bismol.
probably the most impressive one i've seen him do
u are all driving on the wrong side of the road!
Mobility scooter captial of the world 🤣 We call it Gods waiting room. We go there every year, I should know I'm on my fifth heart attack. They just can't kill me.
Good song! For future reference, if you're poop is jet black, it means that your stomach is bleeding.
I had anxiety this whole video thinking he was going to be late back to his car.
Tremendous
Eyy! Rancid fan... or at least aware of them!
When beard starts making casual conversation 2 mins in, you know he’s confident.
Nice beard you are next father christmas
I went to the dentist yesterday.... Snicker
I grew up a massive fan of Rancid!
I used to love Rancid back in the day 😂 Haven't listened to them in years. Loved the reference Beard! Haha.
The babe waitress should keep you coming back...don't tell Mrs Beard.
Was this served on a partial plank of the mayflower?
My beard is nowhere near as glorious as Adam's, and I seem to end up with more food in mine than he does. That little shake of a napkin on the beard is beautiful to watch and one I try to do but just cannot master!
@BeardMeatsFood It would be nice to see the clock run down from the time allowed instead of up.
Thats an OUTRAGEOUS amount of food
Instead of asking for the dessert menu as usual you should have asked if they has a 36oz steak to compliment the sweets.  You had five minutes left on the challenge.
Destination unknown ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
I know you're fully primed on what you do, but just how much sugar would have been in that lot?! Genuinely curious, apart from wrinkles on your fingers, do you notice any other side effects from that much sweetness in one go?
I always just fast forward until about 2 minutes left & the plate is clean. Cheers 🍻
Hope u get plaqe..get it? Haha :P   Shurley I'm not the only one who comes here for the best dronecam on utube?
Stop pouring syrup all over the table, use the plates provided lol
no desert ?
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby soho!
well for one, you have to give me something that would be a challenge to eat, a pancake breakfast with a brownie dessert, coffee included?  well yes.    now a dozen eggs a pound of bacon a pound of sausage a pound of potatoes and 12 pieces of toast would be a slog for me, for some, a pancake breakfast.
I was watching this on the big screen, and my gf walked through and was like "No efin way that dude is eating all that"!🤣🤦
You know, I went to the dentist yesterday. 😂😅 So random…
no desert after that challenge shame on you :D
Really man do you just have a whole in you stomach like were does it all go?!
Is that a cup of... Pepto Bismal?! oooof.
I eat about that many pancakes twice a week for my lunch (with peanut butter and maple syrup), admittedly I have never timed myself. Yes, I eat a lot of calories
Youse a silly sausage Beard 😂 a silly silly sausage youse
As soon as I saw Ruby Soho I said Rancid I'm 62 and my 29-year-old daughter and my 62-year-old husband just looked at me because a few minutes later they revealed that that's why they named their restaurant that LOL
I'm more of an Op Ivy fan. :)
No “ooskidoo”(sp)??…hahaha
That was a heroic effort Mr Beard, I was seriously concerned when you finished the pancakes yet still had all the extras to down. I don't know but if it were me I would have done my utmost so as not to disappoint the waitress, she was absolutely lovely! Very well done Adam, onwards and upwards.
Quick Question, have you ever ate a bunch of food and got food poisoning from it?   I feel like if you ate a bunch of undercooked or contaminated food, it would cause a lot of problems, so i was curious if it ever happened to during a challenge
" I'd lick it if I had to " That's what she said .
think you missed the trademark weird noise there
Where in the world did you put all that food? After eating one of those massive pancakes I would've needed to call it quits...for the entire day!
Haha as soon as I saw the name "Ruby Soho" I said to myself "ahhh just like the Rancid song" Awesome!
That right there was a good piece of business. As always,  thank you for the video.
next year it'll be 18 pancakes 😛
Ripped my toenail off on a caravan gate that hit me in the wind ouch!!! That was in brid too, dirty brid!!
Your pancreas must of hated you.
Maybe they'll give me a plaque  🤣
I live in Bridlington and I’ve still never been to Ruby Soho. I shall use the place in the very near future. I don’t fancy that challenge though. 😂
Beard, is like a cat with a mouse with these folks
Anyone else a little bit extra excited when Beard goes somewhere you know?
So. Many. Carbs.
Yikes! Too much starch and sugar induce diabetes.
Is it just me or was the waitress having a thing on Beard?
Love your channel, lots of love from Ireland 🇮🇪 ❤ 💕
Punk AF!
Awesome vid as always but now I'm a celeb is on I feel its time for you to try a few Bush tukka trials
When are coming to Dublin Adam
You make it look so easy Mr beard
that waitress though
You are an incredible athlete!
Good lord, if you were a diabetic I'm sure your feed would be turning black under the table or your insulin pump would catch fire.
Awesome, Adam!
Kudos to you for this challenge because pancakes are always so dry no matter how much syrup ya add. There's no way I could've completed even three pancakes, worse is all that overloaded crap you're expected to eat too. You're a true champ.
Anyone reading this please accept the Lord Jesus Christ he is coming soon and he loves you very much God bless you
The absolute best place going 😍 love it at Ruby Soho it’s so good
Breakfast challenges are more impressive to me. Breakfast foods are almost inedible when they get cold, and it gets cold really quick.
Brid, home of the pedophile
That is cool that they are named after Rancid’s song. Fun fact there is a wrestler named Ruby Soho that comes out to that song. She is awesome.
I always think I could easily eat a massive plate of pancakes - can never eat more than 6. 16 is incredible
"I'd lick it if I had to." Soon available on a t shirt in the Beard Meats Food store.
Great job!
those are funny lookin raspberries....
Did anyone else notice that there were 11 Biscoff Biscuits instead of the 10 stated for the challenge?
Holy cow!  MY stomach hurt and I didn’t even eat anything!  Good on ya!  Don’t know how you do it!  🥳🎉🤢
great song by Rancid
Another snack for the beard
Destination unknown!!
Nothing grosser than overfilling on pancakes.
My teeth hurt just watching this...
That fella was a real card. Talk about carbing it up EH! Well done. 👍👍
The waitress looked like she had a hot figure
Does the king reply :)
I gotta say I’d like to try this challenge.  I’d fail but I love pancakes and this does look delicious!
What's the point of the biscuits on this?  Is this the breakfast equivalent of chips?
Have to say, didn't think he'd do it
I think that's the first time I've seen you like actually challenged.  Great video, food looked dank and gotta love a Rancid reference!
The syrup is gonna go everywhere
That waitress. 😉😉😉
The way they would have won would be mushroom pancakes or is it too obvious?
Looks like you needed a salty menu instead of the dessert menu at the end. Lol
Pro tip…….dip the pancakes in the syrup instead of pouring it on top. Makes a whole lot less mess and the pancakes dont get as soggy.
If I'd attempted that, black coffee would have been required. As I started typing that, you ordered one!😀
YOU WOULD LICK IT!!   HAHAHAH
Comment for algorithm.
“I said dramatic you don’t have to shout!” 😂😂😂
I know he was thinking "impossible you say, watch this peasant"🤣. Love the vids mate been watching for years.
The waitress sure seemed to like you haha 😉
I generally wonder how much money he has spent on JUST fuel for the journey, must be at least a couple hundred with the cost of living
MY PANCREAS JUST EXPLODED WATCHING THIS SHIT..
You're really saying "you can't tell what size it is because of the photo"???? Pot, kettle, black.
not only did you eat all the other stuff but those 16 pancakes were THICK! also the female shop employee was a cutie.
That lady really likes you. 😉
That last brownie looked dense.
Mate - I've not been to Brid in years. I kinda miss it
5:54 somebody ain't shy...
To me it looks like a diet platter haha.   Also me I murder buffets for  FUN.  Still not kidding it looks like a light stack to me.
No wonder they call it impossible they spend so much time talking to you it’s nearly impossible to finish in 30 mins 🤣
I get that a slab  of wood looks interesting but it doesn't hold food
You should start salting your pancakes!   Sweet / Salty is great!  Maybe save that towards the end as a mental boost?
The eyes mesmerize me 👀👀👀👀👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️
That lady's very stance said all you need to know about her attitude.
Blatantly Kwass-ont...🥐👍
He Must Have One Those POWER Flush Toilet No Way a Standard Flush Will Take Care Of His Dumps !!!
I’m pretty sure that girl working wanted you lol.
The staff seem great here. Always nice to see.
That was the diabetes challenge…
Spent 7 minutes of that just chatting
I really should know better.  I was doubting you at the start because that looked horrendous.  I will never doubt you again.
Keep doing your thing 🔥🔥🔥
This doesn't look that hard tbh..
Random. But that woman working there looks beautiful
Yeah man should be bangin.. god I wish people in the states would talk like that
Paused to comment on the Rancid reference
I've got a little sniffle and headache today.  Saw this vid come up while eating some chicken soup.  Finished off the soup because you can't eat soup while watching a pancake challenge.  Needed something more fitting and since I still had a little tummy room and only felt up to canned soup and other easy things to make threw some cream, ice and sugar into a blender with dehydrated strawberries and having  a nice after meal strawberry shake while I watch.
When you do these super sweet breakfast challenges, why don't you get a side of bacon for a salty break
I'm a new sub, binge watching your videos made me nauseous and I had to go lie down. You're an absolute beast, I love it.
Sorry mrs beard that waitress was wett as hell on mr beard, thinking if he can eat that he can demolish me 😅
Yet another killer challenge.  Cheers from Virginia big guy!
hats off my good sir
Destinatiooon unknoooown ... Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho!  ✊😎
You should look up some food challenges in Alabama there some good one
Maybe if they didn't serve it on a log stuff wouldn't roll onto the floor!
Probably not one to say. Im not the expert here, But why not slap some of those bananas/blueberries/ice cream in between those pancakes. It almost drove me crazy he saved all the toppings for last. Still, job well done. It was completed! Lol
Some people have got "some crack about 'em, some have'nt". Enough said.
Am I the only person that was annoyed that food was took off the floor and put on the table for Beard eat at the end, like that was gonna be the make or break 😒
Wait…Beard didn’t even say delicious?  How will I know if the food was good or not?!?
Saw Rancid in the late 90s at Reading (I think) the best song on that album is Maxwell Murder...can't beat that bass solo! :D
Awesome!
dont lie pinoccio
wish i knew you was in my home town, would have loved a picture :D
Adam had that waitress a little flustered. She couldn't stop staring at him.
Was this man born with two stomachs, or maybe three? Is he a time traveler, Alien?
I really want to cook for you. You would make my feeder heart sing
Would have been fun if beard had asked: “Do you have a dessert menu?” Lol
Great challenge. Was that a cup of pepto bismol I saw.
Another instant classic. Great job Mr. Beard.
The blueberry’s spilling off the edge was giving me anxiety
From Rancid's best album(in my opinion) ...And Out Come the Wolves... 😁👍👍
“Maybe they’ll give me a Plaque” some high tier dad jokes right here 🔥
12:34 what na idiot...
For 1 hour that’s a lot of likes n views mr b ❤️
Pancakes are so filling, I wouldn't even get halfway through this.
This is amazing. I was full just looking at the platter...
You are my absolute person to feed....and Mrs Beard....I love carbs as much as the next woman but still Mrs Beatd has me beat
the city looks great, food looks great and the lady looks great
The big question is, were you there long enough to get a ticket?  Update: no
I lived in Bridlington for 11 years. What a boring place it is 😂
I need to try this challenge
No bacon?
1:01 but your name isn't Max so shouldn't you be able to park as long as you like?
Mr. Beard- what a way to get your fruit in! I love the new JUMBO blueberries here in the U.S.! 🫐 Loved this one!🥞👏🏻
She looks like Victoria Pedretti 😍😍😍😍😍
That looks soo good
A good final item on one of these challenges would be a wafer thin mint.
Imagine the mess Beard would make if he were to throw up while he was finishing that last bite......
Frank Miller reference made my day.
The food digest INSTANTLY and goes straight to the BEARD lol this man can eat... Love the vids
Add salt to the coffee?
I couldn't do this because when I eat to much sugar I get a splitting headache
I bet you were buzzing off your tits after eating that much sugar Adam 😂 Great video fella & thanks for the effort. See you on Thursday. Much luv.
what was that glass of pink stuff in the foreground...candle? kept expecting you to drink it.
Why do you keep getting in your car on the wrong side? From Tennessee with no shoes.
i really hope that's real maple syrup. the better of 2 evils
Did they say £30?
The food looks amazing. Love all of the toppings and sauces. And I love pancakes. That’s a challenge I think I could win.
🔥
Rancid, now there is a band I've not heard off in donkeys!
Welcome the videos brew. Can’t do what You do but it’s making me try more. Literally should be able to eat more  Dealing with pain on the daily isn’t comfortable. Fighting not having pain killers dealing with pains and a long challenge with food because of meds and not having appetite. It’s an exciting moment to see the appetite I use to have!   Keep killing it brew
Hey man haters are gonna hate, that means you are successful in America 👍 we enjoy watching you are so do millions of other people too 😎💯🌶️💥
Feels like fate that this came out right after getting home from having American style pancakes for the first time in years with my friends. Feels like I'm reliving that sweetness all over again 🥴🥴
Try texasburgers the next time you visit bridlington, awesome place👌 glad you made it through the type 1 diabetes challenge 😉
After something that sweet maybe you should be asking if they have a cheeseboard after?? 😂
Desta-nay-shu-hun unknown Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby SoHo!
When you started talking about the dentist visit a couple minutes in I knew this would be too easy
The gal in black be like “how you doin?”
it's not often we see you visibly struggling. You could tell that one was tough
Hot waitress alert🔔🔔🚨🚨
Not a bad showing
"I never win anything"... Says the guy that constantly beats challenges and sets record times and wins awards and t-shirts and such.
where's the 'do you have the mains menu' after :D  this is a hard watch, all that sugar, i've just had 6 biscuits and that's enough for me, well done sir
Plot twist: "Do you have a main course menu?"
5 years for me between dentist appointments
I'm always fascinated by this. And I can't finish a regular fish n chips! Love it keep going and enjoying life!!
You remind me of a great white shark. A true eating machine.
Waitress lady is fine af
Oh wow a challenge without 10lbs of chips.
Love ruby soho by rancid
On a different topic - I think all cars should have complete drive capability on both sides. Kinda like an airplane.  All instrumentation in the middle.
Black stool usually indicates a gastrointestinal bleed... at least when I was at work in the good ol days.
as an extra a free heart attack xD oof im not a sweettooth
The bearded Tarrare.
you must have a tape worm about 20 feet long in your guts in order to eat like that.
I’m I the only one who fast forwards to the end to see if he’s completed it or not?
5:18 That joke fell flat...like a pancake....get it?!
Beard for PM!
Proper thick them pancakes 😮
And Out Come All the Pancakes!!!
Beard. You should do a Big John Fisher challenge with what he gets for a Chinese on a Saturday night 😂😂😂
you help so much with my fight with PTSD and depression - amazing video bro big love <3
Ruby Soho by Rancid is such a great song!  Edit: I doubt I’d finish 2 of those pancakes. The sweetness alone would be my undoing
Love your videos Adam... All the way from Norway.... 😃😀
That was the biggest sponge I've ever seen anyone eat.
You forgot YOUR TOWEL☺️
Oh man I could totally go for a fat stack of pancakes! Definitely not that many though haha 😂
I got up to go make pancakes after watching this but I was out of mix.
13:49 check out his handbag...
A+ for the Frank Miller reference
"I once at so many blueberrys my poop was jet black" ......u know internal bleeding can make ur poop black right?
You’re a beast!
👍
Do you ever, never feel like eating for the rest of the day. I mean full up 🤮
You win stuff all the time...
marshmellows?,i would have walked out before I got started for that. gross.
I got that challenge in the bag!!!!....I would talk less as well hahahaha!!! Burn!!!
Had to hit the like button after the "plaque" pun
That last blueberry could of been your Mr Creosote moment..
You are the GOAT!! 16 pancakes! Holy Schmokes!! Pancakes are my Kryptonite. "All you can eat" pancakes for me is like, three pancakes. They feel like they swell-up --- like pouring water on a dry sponge.
I have to say you are an amazing eater! I am quite a bit larger human being than you Adam yet, I know for a fact, I could never keep up with your ability to ingest such large amounts of food in so little time and I am not just talking about this impossible pancake challenge. I watch for the sheer amazement on how you are able to stay in as good of shape as you are and still eat the way these challenges require. I believe I would be long dead to say the least.
Your plumber must cry every time you call.
I love it when you have interaction with the staff and/or guests, hilarious more often than not.
I love pancakes, I could eat a fair few of those but not all that crap with them just some sugar and lemon juice please.
Served on a proper bit of lumber. I'm a little surprised your ensemble didn't include a black coat and white shoes.
Well done, Sir!
My 7 year old daughter said ‘less talking, more eating - you can talk when you’re finished ‘ 😂😂😂 must have had training from Mrs Beard! 😆
The candle on the table looked like a glass full of Pepto Bismol lol :D
Ruby Soho is a aew wrestler
I always think how rubbish the UK is when someone is going to independent, obscure, small businesses to use their services and have some fun….and yet have to assume the risk of a parking penalty. It’s like the government want the big corporations to win 😂😂😂
Beard: You guys got a regular menu?
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Soho!
You needed to ask for a burger afterwards. Some reverse psychology! 🤓
In this case, the destination was not unknown. Another victory! I had confidence in you the whole way. Thanks for another fun video and for putting Rancid in my head.
That pink light reminds me of the Beard studio. What happened to that place?
Is that from the mids menu?
Destination unknown…🎵🎵
Someone needs to tag AEW Wrestler Ruby Soho for this.
The reason why he took longer is out of respect to these people! What a champ
Adam you need to figure out how Randy and Katina always manage to gather a whooping and a'hollerin' crowd even in the UK...all that suffering for a single clap that you had to actually ask for seems unfair.
Currently watching while enduring a stomach bug. I feel so sick 🤢 but I can’t stop watching 😂
Awesome job!!
Whenever you do these videos, can you film the process of how these dishes are prepared if the restaurants allow it?
a nice that's what she said in this one..
Do they change the name of it now ??
You mentioned the Shake, You mentioned all the food, not addressed was what looked like a glass of strawberry milk on the front corner of the table.  Was that required?
He looks like Luke Harper !
Dad jokes will soon be renamed Beard jokes 🤣
Lovely dress.
The waitress 😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let me know when your coming to bull mountain grill billings montana usa for the 72oz steak challenge plus trimmings
When a restaurant is cool and let you do this and record, my loyalty will always be there and would eat at this great place 1-2 time's a week or more.
Robert Turnbull with the greatest advertising play he'll ever make 😂
The fact that they serve it on a log makes it so much cooler lol
Starting your video with a car alarm, very nice. Well at least it beats you singing:)
I have no idea why I love your videos so much when am on a diet but it really helps me behave.
Tag that waitress shes hot, ill invite u to the wedding if it comes down to that
Your "plaque" joke genuinely made me chuckle. I need to get out more
Those pancakes look soooooooo good!
This made my teeth itch! Well done though. Surely you had fish and chips in that there Bridlington Mr B? 😊
Destination unknown.  Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho.  Literally the only song by Rancid that I know.
for people looking up Rancid and love it. Check out Operation Ivy as well. Tim and Matt played in that band before.
Well done beard, another sunday another video love it 😀
That looks easy, what's for dessert? 👍😄
Was the glass of pink stuff Pepto Bismol?
Two or three of those pancakes and I would be done.
09:40 the bloke having a cheeky look 😂
@BeardMeatsFood do you ever struggle with heart burn after eating so much?!? 😂
Rancid is a classic punk band!
What a waste of good Yorkshire puddings
There is a female wrestler called Ruby soho
i hope you and Mrs beard are well and another great video
Nicely done Sir
More eating less chitchat if only got 30 minutes
The hosts seem very lovely People definitely the most talkative I’ve seen for a while ha , looked superb
Do you regurgitate afterwards? Serious question.
What's for dessert?  Is that from the kids menu?   Etc etc   🤣🤣
Restaurant went down in my books as soon as he made you eat those berries from the ground🤷
All you do is win, food challenges.
So fun!
...was that a kid's dessert 😉
I consider watching this channel to be a pretty pointless waste of my time although I can't help myself from coming back for each upload
I'd give it a try.  But I'll need to have a serious dose of the MUNCHIES. Time frame may be a bit OTT
Would you not have put the fruit and stuff into the pancakes instead of just the syrup to get rid of the stuff
Considering that took you 26 minutes that is going to be nearly impossible for anyone less than elite eaters. Awesome video Adam
Man, if the beard gets a ticket after a food challenge, that is something...
You are correct the French pronunciation of croissant is correct by my American wife can’t even say basil or herbs correctly LOL
Omg man, this challenge is true diabetes on a plate
I love how other challenge eaters are totally focussed on the food, and then Adam comes along, beats the record while casually keeping a conversation going on the side.
I sympathetically went into a diabetic coma
It's all good Beard, we all usually lick it when we have to. 👍
"plaque"....HAHAHHAHA. I genuinely laughed at that!
Modern day curse: 'A plaque upon thy teeth...' 😉
how many times do you puke from eating al lthese foods?
mobility scooter capital of the world? nah that has to be somewhere in florida
"Do you have a cheese and bacon menu?“
I'm currently on a diet, you eat more calories in this single meal that I had this whole week I think. And yes, this is supposedly impossible. Even in my worst binge eating times I could not eat more than 5-6 moderately "sauced" pancakes(full at 4 rly). There was 16 of them, fruits, those deceiving biscuits and that milkshake filled with salted butter brownies. It's just insane and it can really kill someone.
I'd be in a mobility scooter after that lot.
Americans pronounce it “qwaw-sont
Well done man, thankfully you weren't forced to eat the wooden board.
Really miss "let's get it" aka "whooosgetittt!" Great video
Yes ladddd
Hey everyone - sending this note to those who don't have Jesus, yet.  We are in what the Bible calls the "end times," and I'm sure you see the signs all around us.  Please - believe in our Lord Jesus Christ today. He died on the cross to cover our sins so that we  may be saved, and to avoid the judgment that is coming. When you believe in him, and accept His gift of salvation, you will be saved.   Our time is so, so short. I am praying for you all.  Ephesian 2:8; John 3: 16-18; 1 Corinthians 15: 1-4; Romans 10: 9-10
I can barley eat 4 n add marsh mellows 🤢
I wonder what his cholesterol is like.
Breakfast with Mr.Beard is always special .👍😁
You never win anything? You win almost every food challenge known to man what do you mean? 😂
Makes my tiny plate of food look like what an ant would eat......
Stop all the talking u fucking idiot and get  better times
“I would lick it if I have to.” Famous last words. Lol. No wonder why your teeth are so healthy, constantly subjected to surface germs.😂
Anyone else wonder why beard had a glass of Gaviscon on the table before releasing it was a candle?
This is literally 21st century church on a Sunday…once again worshipping a bearded man 🤪
Love it ! Thanks
🥞 Pancakes are so filling that I would rather take on a 🍣 Sushi and 🦞🦐🍤 seafood challenge.  I get stuffed just eating 2 🥞 pancakes with butter 🧈 and syrup.  Beard is an Amazing food challenge competitor.
wow that was pretty damn impressive 👏
After hearing the plaque joke, im convinced you’re a fat dude in a healthy body. Cheers.
PLAQUE. hahaha. Mrs. Beard come get this guy :D
Fantastic t-shirt! I wonder how many ppl missed the tache on it... :)
are you old enough to know rancid?
Instead of asking for a desert at the end, you should of asked for a bacon sarnie 🤣 Well done 🎉 When I first saw the size of it, I thought, omg he’s no chance here. 😮 Well done bro 👏👏👏
Every time you need confirmation of what obvious foods are, I wonder if you know what food is 😂😂😂
what's for desert?
Ruby Soho is an old reggae song. It was covered by Rancid
Lol very cordial of him to retrieve your berry 🤣
How does he stay so skinny?
When you got to the last blueberry it reminded me of Mr Creasote from Monty Pyhon . Just one more wafer thin mint 🤣
After you finished this challenge you should have asked: "Do you have a main course menu?" :))
Great job! Congrats!! ❤👏😊
Fake Biscuits you sure they were safe to eat lol
Start 3:49
That looks AMAZING!
Trotters Bar,Harrogate next Saturday night.KARAOKE!!!😁
Why?
Ruby Soho is also now a wrestler in AEW who was named after the Rancid song (uses it as her entrance music too). Crazy that Rancid keeps coming up all these years later.
Im loving these ones with the more interactive owners and employees
IBOP. International Beard of Pancakes🥞
That waitress definitely wanted an application to be the next Ms. Beard
I appreciate how you are kind enough to leave a little extra time on the clock of an uncompleted ‘impossible challenge’ just to give another bloke a glimmer of hope that they may beat your record of completing an ‘Impossible Challange’.
I am gutted I live in Bridlington and missed you 🥹
Omg just air played you on lounge tv for first time and you have great skin ! Lol another superb vid, love ya mate keep up great work
There’s an update to fix that annoying alarm when opening the door. There’s been about 4 since that one!
b4 u metioned ur teeth i was lookin at em a lil earlier in the video n said....hmmmm he got nice teeth
Wow !!  Sweet Dreams 😴 🤣 !!  Congratulations ❣️
Smashed it. That was huge. Have a great evening.
grats
She looked bang tidy! Needed more views of her!
I like it when you have hot waitresses in the video.
Recognised 3 times from the car to the challenge.. LETS GET IT!!!!!
Name a more classical scene than Beard coming to his car running after a challenge just to make sure his car doesn't have a ticket
"I never win anything"  *Wins challenges weekly
“I would lick it if I had to!” A T-Shirt slogan if ever I heard one. 😂😂
Not gonna lie…saw you were doing a pancake challenge and hurried and went to make some pancakes lol
those cookies at the end look like metamucil chips.
Well done "mate" or "lad". You make this look so easy!
Ok got my 2 egs over easy 2 pieces of toaste and a big bowl off cereal....let's do this!!!!
destination unknown, ruby ruby ruby soho 🎶
I would have had absolutely no chance. You’re a monster mate
It's always a good day when it's a Beard day.
OMG! A challenge I could actually contemplate doing. I LOVE pancakes like this. It would be a pleasure.... EDIT: Oh dear. I would not like the sugary stuff....
is there a better way to drink water for something like this? if you could train drinking with a garden hose to smash the food down would it decrease your times?
One of my fav episodes this year. Cracking. Staff were great. Food looked amazing! Especially named after a rancid song!
idk how it happened but this became my comfort channel ❤️
Half expected AEW star Ruby Soho to make an appearance
you should file the patent for the banana mop 😄
I don't know if you ever watched death note the anime but you laugh exactly like Ryuk 😂 brilliant anime btw
No Husker Dü my man. You know it's serious now.
Doing a food challenge is awesome but when restaurants start to add extra shit just because this is what you are famous for is not cool.
That was impressive!  I get stuffed with just two pancakes. 👍
Mobility scooter capital if the world? Try Rhyl mate....its like brands hatch in the pedestrian zones.
"Plaque!" 😆😁😄
Imagine how quick you could've done it if you quit fkn yapping 😂😂👍🏻
I usually eat what you eat later on in the day 😂 just cause it looks good lol well before you destroy it anyways
Pancake challenges are seriously impressive, I literally struggle to eat two... But damn, now I really want a panckake!
They should give you a gold tooth
Impressive takedown of those pancakes 🥞
That lady was getting hungry for some beard ;)
Wow, you are a global celebrity!!  Hollywood types, no way, but I would stop to say hello if I saw you and congratulate you on your success (and to say Hi to Mrs. Beard).
He didn’t say let’s get it I like when he enter act with the staff
I am always hungry after your video ! feeling i will eat something hugeee!  but when i see prices i do oposite chellenge suddenly xDDD
Good lord Beard I don’t see how you did it !!! All that sugar man !!! What did you feel like after it hit your system?
Dang.. You would have a pregnant looking belly after stuffing that food inside wouldn't it? Wow, incredible.
"I'd lick it if I have to." That would make a cheeky T.
So what’s for desert ? Couldn’t resist 👀
Love Rancid...
Earl Lee Gang!
You must know leave metal spoon in cup to take away heat kev thanks 4 ur great Entertainer
Is that Mrs Beaards Mumat the front door!!  🤣😂
Canit believe you ate 16 pancakes and didn't use any of the toppings apart from syrup 🤣 well done
I love watching your videos!
Hahaha have you got a death wish talking about Mrs beards mum like that ? Great job as always Adam.That challenge looked lush but no way could I do that.I was full after watching 3 pancakes 🥞
the lady dropping the tea towel on the floor and then wiping her hands with it....
Kind of makes you want to get an order of chip
How in the world is this even possible!? Lol, great work man.
Awesome job like the video’s keep them coming
This was way too easy for you, me and my brother always say if you didn’t have conversations you would be a epic speed eater, and this one proved it 😁😎👍
Is it ironic that Im sitting here sucking my teeth with toothache while watching ?
Jesus. My limit on pancakes is 3
I need a nap just watching this. So much sweet your an animal!
Hey man what was your least favorite most disgusting challenge?
Please weigh yourself before and after each challenge.   Wouldn’t pouring the milkshake onto the pancakes be equally delicious not to mention soften the pancakes AND negate any brain freeze?
Is that a glass of pepto-bismol on the table?
Hmm... Where is the desert menu? :D
Ruby Soho is a classic tune. I love it.
Hi Adam well done bro on ur challenge I don’t no how u do it 👍awesome 👏👏👏👏👏👏catch u on  the next 1
I love my cakes, i would love to try this, never heard of a blondie, i had to google it to see what it was
I still don't know if this encourages my over eating or stops it
I remain 😮 S.H.O.C.K.E.D 😮 that you’ve yet to become a parent given your natural gift for 🌟Dad Jokes🌟as evidenced here. 😂 (Plaque) Also, very curious what the bright pink stuff in the glass in the foreground was. Strawberry yoghurt? 🤔
I've just developed dietetes watching this, tha sorted it though lad nice one! 👍🏻
I would have a hard time with this one, i dont like bananas and i cant eat a lot of pancakes.
Carb loading is just necessary sometimes :)
This video makes me want the Christmas Single this year to be a parody of "Ruby Soho" now
Cant believe this video is in my home town cant believe we missed ya lol would of been good to meet you we watch your videos all the time
That is just fucking amazing Mr Beard 😂🤘
Good job!! I’m curious why you didn’t make each pancake into a taco with the toppings you had to eat. 😊
Come to hawaii do the Mac 24 pancake challenge. Man v food loss to it
A Beard video and an Arsenal win, lets get ittttttt!
maybe im just thirsty, but that woman is fine
Some of those pancakes looked sooooo thick!!! I was worried they were gona be a bit raw inside but nope, smashed it mate 👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽
I have seen you do so many challenges. And I honestly thought there was no way you were gonna finish this one. Wow. That was nuts
Good Job Beard
that cutting board looks like a giant cut of salmon 😂
Missed opportunity for an outro : "I usually ask for a desert menu but uhm…"
0:22 It is also the name a great Wrestler over in the US 🙌🏾
Destination unknown.
Can we get your weekly workout video because I love to see it.
What I don't like about pancakes is that the first bite is incredible, it's hot, the butter melts, the syrup runs... there's nothing better, but by the second bite, it's ice cold!  They are terrible at retaining heat.  At least with a giant stack of them, from the middle down they stay warm enough to be enjoyed.  Of course, all of that is moot when you can scarf them down as an Olympian like Beard does!
Any way you could introduce me to the lovely woman working there?
16 pancakes in 30 minutes. Must be a typical Tuesday for Beard.
My forklift must be broken. When I back up the alarm goes off. Tomorrow I'll tell my boss🤣🤪
Ru-by ruby ruby ruby Soho!!
Wouldn't be a beard video without an existential crisis
Is that what you say to mrs beard. I'll lick it if I have to hahaha 😆
me and my brother love watching you he enjoys eating fast and alot of food but hes nowhere near as good as you his problem is hes fussy with what he eats 🤣
I can vouch for the blueberries turning your poop black buddy.  Once a time ago, my friend and me were poor.  It was blueberry season so yeah.. I understand!!
“Do you guys have a desert menu”
PLAQUE.... *GROAN!!!   lol
5:13 "probably cos i never win anything" yeah mate only a food challenge or two per week, never at all really
I think that they could be the funniest hosts so far, really good rapport and banter :)
I thought this was a food challenge, looked like something off the kids menu.
Great stuff bearded one.
Just crap thrown all together for the sake of it!!!??? What a crap place but love the channel
Damn Beard... You uploaded this 35 minutes ago and you already have over 65,000 views and 300 comments! Anyhow, about to watch this and I have every bit of confidence in you! No food challenge is impossible for you... Im sure you could return to ones that defeated you in the past and take them down if you so chose to do! Youre amazing, keep up the great videos and commentary! Most entertaining competitive eater ever. 💕
well that's one way to give someone an anxiety attack... put an advertisement flyer under their windshield wiper!
Oh man they missed the chance of calling it the Sellout Punk Cake Challenge
three bananas and a milk shake with a big brownie on top alone is like a side challenge for the pancake challenge.
Great challenge...I reckon the lassie was impressed 😉...BOOM BOOM...
You got the stomach of a Renaissance King
Hi beard please come to donnerism in Droylsden mancheater we have a new challenge on 😊❤ burritos and burgers
this is sone of the biggest in my opinion... it doesn't even seem physically possible
Brid is a great little shithole
Do you need to take insulin after to control the blood sugar?
Ruby Soho is also an AEW wrestler who uses the name and the song for her entrance. Apparently the singers a huge fan of hers and suggested the name to her and gave her the song to use
that looked challenging! good job! yay!
best youtuber rn
That shake possibly getting knocked off was giving me anxiety...  If you pushed it over it could have failed the challenge  Idk how you eat with people watching you all the time too. I understand they need to confirm you don't cheat but jeez they can't seem to leave you alone.
Thank you for the content, Mr. Beard!
Beard, Having black stools ain't a great thing.
another great video from the beard king.
that's how our Mr Beard makes the  impossible POSSIBLE ! well done to you , your dentist would be proud 😁 great video 👍❤
Brilliant, well done again. You make it look so easy. My problem would be the maple syrup, I would just drink it lol. Great video as always. Sundays and Thursdays were meant for your videos
I feel like the spare underwear was packed for this video? 🩲
My pal told me you was in brid I closed the scran van early to try and catch you but I was too late hopefully see you next time mate
"Plaque. Get It?" 😆😆😂😂🤣🤣😅😅😄😄
The plaque joke made my day.
Great job and great video Adam, also so nice seeing you take time to interact with the fans and just people in general. That was an insane amount of food I can only eat like 3 to 6 little blocks of chocolate then I'm overlay sweet. Hope you have an amazing time and thank you for entertaining us so :)
Man been following you for years. And watching your channel go from strength to strength, is such a joy to follow.
For you it's a challenge, for me just watching it all tastes super good the whole time, cos I don't get the fatigue of actually eating it all, so I'm just like mmmm yum yum all the way to the end!
Rancid fav tune out come the wolves:)
over 20 seconds burned talking about teeth so dumb I love watching food challenges but ive lost all interest in watching his stuff any more he isnt funny and talks way to much its just dumb now
What’s for dessert?
Hell yes!!!!!
Another great video thank you for making my Sunday
Fantastic victory and video, though I wonder what your blood sugar level was after all that sugary food. Be well and stay safe.
There’s a wrestler called Ruby Soho. Think we know how she got that name.
That waitress was pretty smokin!
I think I got diabetes watching you eat loool another super performance beard! 😂👌🏾
how does that even fit inside you 😲
That was a way cool video and the food all looked great but something about pancakes i cant eat more then a couple they fill me up way fast. Beard you killed it as always as impressive as all your eating skills are im most impressed but your ability to handle sweets that seems so hard and is the flavor i get tired of the quickest. People seemed cool at that place and as a youngster punk music was my favorite and i still love it so hell yea on naming the place after the rancid song i grew up on bad religion. The stooges.  Black flag.  Lots of punk that and gothic music was my favorite. Way to go as always almighty bearded one your the man
They should've put a cover over the stack of pancakes, to keep em nice and warm, throughout the challenge. I can't stand cold pancakes personally. But it looks like (if it was a drastically smaller portion) quite a tasty meal😁
ah yes gotta wake up at 6 am tomorrow to go to work yet watching this amazing beard guy eating like 50 tons of food which can sustain me for 3 days or so never regretted subscribing ngl
WHAT IS WITH SERVING MESSY ITEMS ON PLANKS OF WOOD?🤦‍♂️
Is it a vegetarian challenge? No meat?
While there are some of these challenges that I look at and say "that doesn't look too bad... I may be able to do half of it"  no way I could do half of this one, hell just 8 pancakes would be difficult without all the other crap.
Ruby Soho is also a name of a AEW wrestler
Brilliant! Another cracking episode Beard. 👌🏽
You’re awesome beard, love your videos
Blimey, those pancakes looked more like huge crumpets! Mmmm.... crumpets 🤤
I'll never get over how blue slush puppies make my poop green.
Before I eat pancakes, I lake to, layer my layer, pour syrup over each one.
Was sure you were going to play Ruby Soho at the start!!
What does your stomach feel like the day after one of these
After something like that I would want a nice chilli cheese dog for dessert
great video, when I heard the name of the place I thought: A:  there rancid fans and prefer ruby soho to maxwell murders  B: its a coincidence
I am so sorry to point this out. At 2:00min-2:12min into the video, the camera angle and your nose, reminds me of the kid catcher in chitty chitty bang bang. 🤣😂im so sorry.
I swear I thought it was a strawberry drink on the table and wondering why beard hadnt drank it... to realise it was only a candle haha
Funnily enough. Whilst watching the last video. I was wondering how your teeth were. But now I’m satisfied. So I for 1 appreciate that bit of information
Ruby Soho is an AEW wrestler too ..
This is one of those magical channels, where you don't know how you found it, but it becomes your favorite instantly.
Wow sugar rush..........
Ruby Soho also playing during the car trip was also perfect
Is that the kid's menu?? HAR HAR
Beard, you literally are one of the most polite people on YouTube!
Surely that should be a merch item "I'd lick it if I had to"
Damn dude, for a minute I saw a fail.. amazing.
Personally I'd have done all the extra stuff first and then finished on the yummy yummy pancakes all soaked in sauce mmmmmm!
The biggest challenge will be driving home after all that and trying to stay awake
Rancid all time great metal punk band!!
OMGAWD ADAM, DIP YOUR PANCAKES IN SYRUP
"I would lick it if I had too" that was one of my wedding vows🤣
That looked immense...think you could of shaved a few mins off it thou 🤣
Super performance and video. btw Ruby Soho is my favorite song by Rancid. :)
Wow, vary impressive, that's like eating sponges that swell up. Question, after your done do you take a nap or a walk? What's your routine after the big meals?
is that a cup of Pepto-bismol? =P  Great video, those pancakes looked great!
Mobility scooter capital of the world… You ain’t wrong! 😂
Yeah, I know... Ruby Ruby Ruby so ho
i was very surprised you did not ask for the desert menu this time !!! :D :D :D
that was a close one!
Waited ages for you to drink the strawberry milkshake. Took me far too long to realise it was a candle
The thing is you say it like cwoissant , which sounds closer to a speech impediment than French 🤣
Greetings from the State of Ohio!!🇺🇸 I have no idea how you do these challenges!! Great entertainment!!
Hey presto!! The great Beard makes yet another pile of food vanish !! I often wonder do thes cafes stick more items onto the plie when they know its you coming to take on a challenge lol im so suspicious ! well done once again Adam !
You might have been hungry to eat all that, but that waitress looking at you like she was thirsty
In Montana their is blueberry bears prized by hunters.  They gorge on so many blueberries it turns their flesh blue and flavors it.
Rancid actually made the song as a theme for the pro wrestler named Ruby Soho.
Bridlington…. What a sh*thole… no beef pike, I’m im scarbados… Propa posh 😂
Plaque...... get it 😂😂😂love your videos
Bloody brilliant song!!!!!! 😎 Them pancakes look lush 😊
Eating like a pig
Was that a small glass of Pepto Bismol on the corner of the table?!?
A scouse accent followed by a car alarm......you're playing a dangerous game beard 😂 great vid man 🤟
Has anyone ever said "I know you - we're not letting u do the challenge because we know you'll beat it" ?
Well done
...and for most people it is! Cheers!
My fav time of day
Rancid are class!
These sweet challenges would get me. It'd just be too much sweetness without a break. GG for always being able to get through these types of challenges!
I so was hoping you'd ask for the steak menu after all that sugar...
RIP your toilet.
"I never win anything "   Completes like 3 food challenges a week with like a 98% success rate lol
Now what are you gonna do on Pancake Tuesday ???
The plaque joke made me laugh more than it should haha! Well done as always!
i bet you regularly block the toilet
First off, I don't feel oomph to start will catch on and second.... am I the only one who thought your coffee was pink at 8:52? Keep up the good work good sir
Great work fam
It’s so lovely how you manage to win over nearly every staff member in your quests for gluttony; just seeing the change from skeptical to amazed to lovely and kind is so heartwarming. Faith in humanity restored!
You're a Frank Miller fan? sweet science! you've turned your coolness up to 11. :D
Sexy waitress lol
Your comments are so funny; I didn't know anyone could do this. Well done, Beard, you never let us down. (A+).
1:03  make sure to wear headphones
How long do you normally have to wait for the challenge food to be prepared and brought out?
Blessed Sunday bro keep being great
I love pancakes but a normal person can really only stomach 3 at a time. They are incredibly filling.
mrs beard 2.0
Another reason for me to go back to Brid. Those pancakes look amazing. Yum!
Beard, you need to let go of this constant need for applause-gratification. It's verging on needy...
What’s for desert? 😂
"THEY CALL IT 'THE IMPOSSIBLE PANCAKE CHALLENGE" clearly hasn't met you yet. lol
If you were to design a food challenge, what would it entail?
Dear Adam I’m not having a good day but I was so happy to see your video. Put a smile on my face thank you!
Are everyone in Bridlington fans 👍🏽😂
Has every dad done that with a deck chair or just us two 😂
Have you ever had food that made you sick?
The only bad thing about these kind of challenges is that there’s no cheeky “do you have a dessert menu?” afterwards 😂😂
It looks like the Rock's cheat meal without a workout.
fun fact there also a pro wrestler under the same name. Band gave her permission to use the name and music for her entrance.
Great to see you in Brid Adam and at Bones’s cafe two top guys 👍🏼🥞🥞🥞
That screams diabetics to me lol
The way he shimmies at 6:17 is how I look when I’m happy eating good food 😂
You got a Plaque at the dentists?   Get it?  BAHAHAHA!!!
Wow amazing Job you won't want two see a pancake for a while brilliant video thanks 👍🏻
I can't believe how much time Adam squanders away during these contests, but still manages to set new records LOL
Rancid , is what comes out after , the food looks delicious,  but bananas,  mini marshmallows,  pancakes,  etc , etc , that poor bathroom has no idea 😁😂👍
Was that a glass of pepto bismol at the edge of the table? 😂
How nice of them to incude the dessert in the challenge
Have you ever arrived at a restaurant where they had no idea you were coming and just as you walk in have heard them say  "...ooh, he's here"...?
Amazing video again, always brightens my day watching you eat
Its a shame we have nothing here is Scarborough for you get stuck into lol.
I wonder how much more he could eat if he was just Baked outta his mind...Also come to Las Vegas and do the Cereal Killer challenge
This  is nothing. I once ate a full bigstack and a side of bacon.
I just recently found your channel and have already put the notification for all your videos.  The challenges, commentary, and editing is great.  If you ever come to South Florida to do any challenges, I would totally come out there to support you.  Good stuff!
Is that a cup of Pink Pepto at 3:50 ?
ruby ruby ruby ruby so hoooooooo
No problem at all.
Love ruby soho
This scores very highly in my book, awesome song,  awesome band and of course you Adam..The most awesome of them all..Keep up the fine work..
There isn't too much that is impossible for the Beard of truth! Great video as always Beard! Thank you for keeping us entertained and enjoy your videos as always!
That looked hard work by the end
Nice one Adam another one off the list I never get tired of watching your videos , oh has Mrs Beard finished putting the Christmas tree up 🎄🎅
Video is just black bro. No video feed.
You animal
How you finding the Tesla?
Listen to 1:04 woman sounds very excited
That would literally put me in a coma. Yum at the fruit though.
I feel sorry for your poor pancreas lol
to really pack down the flapjacks avoid the syrup,  jelly or honey is better anyway
👌
Excellent!! Man 16 pancakes is huge. Well done
"i never win anything“ —guy who wins every food challenge
8 pm video - "today doing a pancake challenge" - me: "I could use a pancake challenge, right here, right now"
Nice job on the pancakes. Hard to eat soo much sweet stuff. It's getting towards the holidays. Hope to see more videos of you and Mrs Beard doing some great Christmas videos!
Can’t believe you didn’t listen to him and do the burger breakfast challenge at golden Anchor cafe. Is proper boss
Well I’m sure here early, solid video mr beard
Great job!!
Server flirting w Beard....
She didn't like you saying she's had a sheltered life 🤣🤣
Where is the Syrup ???  Looked like some Dry ass Pancakes
9:41 Old guy checking waitresses arse out ! 😁👍🏻
First, i thought that place was opened by Tim Armstrong and Lars Frederiksen %)
All that sugar was making me feel sick lol I must admit though I smash 10 pancakes with banana and chocolate at home
Man, you need to waste less paper towel.
Waitress wanted a sausage from beard
cruh saunt. i will die on this hill.
You know it have been a mouthful when he doesn't ask for the dessert. Good job love the vids Much love from Europe.
Gross I ate one big pancake an hour ago and I'm still full.
do a blueberry challenge, 10lbs of blueberries
Lovely challenge Adam
Hell with the pancakes, I want that muffin of a waitress!
Anything is possible... Been told you, my wife looks like Kim Possible.
Destination unknown, ruby ruby ruby soho! Great viddy Adam! Cheers mate!
Ruby soho rancid 🥴🥴 what a 💩 song
38th!  Love your videos. Mrs Beard is a great addition to any of your videos. I can’t eat pancakes, too heavy. What’s with the mini marshmallows? Have watched about 3/4 of your videos. I started from the newest and worked backwards, so some of them don’t make sense. But if I watched from oldest to newest, they WOULD make more sense. Keep going, and by the way, I watch your and Josh’s podcast. It’s fun watching two Brits trying to be funny. Just kidding. I look forward to seeing your new videos and podcasts!    Roger in Pierre South Dakota USA! YIPPEE!
Now that guy who put that flier on the car is going to get spam calls left right and centre
I hope this is one that Mrs Beard doesn't watch. I think the waitress was a fan of King Beard 😏😅
i got a  sugar rush just watching that one
This is the calmest video.  Just seems like you are surfing on a wave as a hippie. Just going with the flow.
Well done... that was a lot of sweets.
dude here on Mexico we got eating challenges, and i bet you'd love to face em, one of em actually made by a Wrestler
I thought they had put a glass of pepto bismal on the table for you but no, a candle
Is it just me or do you love dragging it out for these losers who set he challenge trying to con everyday folk?
Kismot killer curry challenge in Edinburgh
Well done Adam 💞
Haven’t heard someone mention Rancid in many of years. Nice throwback
“I never win anything” bros beaten every challenge💀
Adam showed up hungry the lady in the black dress showed up thirsty 😂. Gonna have to start bringing Mrs. Beard to the challenges.
Damn it man, that is a ton of carbs..... I would literally puke if I ate that much sugar.... wow!
Have you ever been down to Canterbury or Margate?
Hell take 2 weeks off after this one 😭😭
The man says "I never win anything" yet seems to prove that wrong with almost every video!!!!!
Whats the line beard says at the start of each challenge? I cant understand it: "Whos guna eat!"???  The shop owners were so nice. i would go there often if i would live around after watching this video
Been working a lot so the videos are a nice treat
I became diabetic just watching this video
Sweet jesus thats alot of pancakes 🤯
EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE FOR BEARD! Unless you're talking about smooth digestion tracks 😆
Love your videos….but not the ‘sweet’ or ‘pudding’ ones
The waitress is a babe
Beard meats food: I don't win any thing...  Literally beats every challenge. Lol
love rancid great band
Asif ypu was in brid 😭😭 n I missed you
Your videos just always make my day better
I am not worthy of all these beard videos🥹
Rancid not let you use the music lol
ahh yes and a wonderful complimentary glass of pepto :p
this been up two seconds and is full of likes and comments.... and this is a true story! I made 16 crepes today for the freezer to have lunches or breakfast ready on the go!! really thin ones tho, not the American kind.
The ONLY thing you should put on pancakes is maple syrup. The only side should be sausage or bacon. I’m old, so get off my lawn! I’m a woodworker, so I was looking at that live edge slab serving platter. I made on for my son-in-law out of live edge live oak. Lovely.
Keep it up
This would have been one of those times where at the end instead of Beard ordering dessert as a flex, he just orders a steak lol.
Destination unknown
Let’s get it 🎉
Ruby soho from one of the greatest album's ever
i suggest you should bring your own tissue…😂
Adam, what is the device on top of the camera? It looks like a phone.
Should bee called Beard meats Challenge !
Sunday Blues has subsided. Thanks brother man!
Great video yet again Adam! Bridlington is a beautiful place.
Adam didn’t you do one like this before? Seems they made the pancakes were extra large.
3:48 - can't tell if there's a candle on the table or if Beard also has to finish a cup of peptobismol
Before I start the video..... Mother of God that's a lot of food!!
Ever come over to Ireland to do any? Let us know in advance and we will cheer you on.
What’s for desert 😉❤
A.H ❤
pancakes need gravy on them not cream  and syrup lol
I can't believe you've been to Brid and I missed you!
Would love this challenge.. mmmm
probably the best thing in brid 🤣
Surely 2 yearly and 6 monthly are the same thing? 😂
My wonder with these challenges is if you can participate if you are allergic to an item. Like will they remove the allergy item and replace it with more of something else?   I’m sure it varies depending on location and challenge but I wonder if there is a typical take on this sort of thing.
This video was a flop
Destination unknown
I had seven pancakes yesterday and thought I was doing ok, but holy heck! Looking forward to the OK series! Cheers!
There is just something about watching this man with a huge beard eat insane amounts of food that just sits well with me.
That’s incredible.
That guy reminds me of Michael Bisping.
Yodel hey EE whoooo !
Eat until you Drop 🍽🤤…
You always make it look so easy. Amazed how casually you were talking about ur teeth among other things while being on a timer! Bravo
Need pancakes now
1st
Them portions never look that small on the menu.😁
Nothing's impossible 💪💪
Let's goooo forever waiting for beard videos, wish they were more frequent but I understand the process
Wassup bro your a very talented guy keep it up my guy just ❤❤
👍🏼👊🏼🦖🍺
😎😎😎😎😎👍👍👍👍👍
They looked amazing 😋😋 well done!!
I just started the video, but I'm assuming Adam gets a parking ticket at the end.
You're the man Adam truly love your videos my friend thanks for another entertaining one and like always keep them coming congratulations!!!!!!!!
I'll bet he's in hog heaven, a breakfast challenge with no mushrooms.
ID lick if i meed to . Thats been said many tomes in the Beard household . 😭😄😄😄
I call it a thousands views a minute 👍🏾🎉
Congrats on your impeccable oral hygiene
Beard, would love to see a vlog of your offdays! is that possible? :)
She is also a AEW wrestler
This is going to be exciting
You celebrity 😂
Is that like the royalty free version of Ruby Soho playing at the start?
Still listening to racid to this day!
Looks like the perfect breakfast place to take Mrs Beard!
They forgot the fried bacon
Damn this video makes me wanna eat pancakes, must make them when I wake up
Shadows of the camera ....   you just don't know how big it is...     no it doesn't look like a stack of pancakes .......   @1.33.     your sense of humour ?
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
You want to get your self to Las Vegas mgm grand  hotel 😍the pancakes gbere are to die for with a whole load of blueberrys
Give this man a plague… 🤣
I'm jealous, all those carbs/sugar you eat look tasty... I just couldn't do it, I'd die lol. I'm a t1 diabetic so, yeah, literally die
Hope you are enjoying your night and hope you had a nice bonfire night
You're getting recognised very frequently these days🤣😂 we're watching a budding celebrity😂
THEY might call it impossible but Beard calls it eradicable!
Love a different breakfast challenge, love a pancake, Le's Denise.💪👊❤
When's the trip to wales going to be released? (Don't wanna give too much away ha!
Already know you finished you good job heard 👍
This is the first challenge I think I've seen that isn't appetizing to me in the slightest. Just a load of sugar and carbs
So, we meet again. You eating (somewhere) and me drinking coffee on my porch!  What a great Sunday tradition! 😊
thats a dope song!!!
It’s not an American pancake but it’s good practice
When he said Ruby Soho, I thought about the wrestler lmao
we already know youre going to own it. lol
No crumbs🤣 when you left he was on his hands and knees with a magnifying glass looking around the table.. Jokes aside, nicely done beard!!
early crew
The man the legend 👍👍
A restaurant named after Ruby Soho that’s punk right there
Was getting anxious….. beard not posting at bang on 7pm thursdays and Sundays is heartbreaking 😢
Thank you for posting, now I can eat breakfast😂🙏🏻
1 minute in!
When they call it the impossible, Beard has to turn up and demolish it.
Hi
Here
Eat up kid !!
You will Definitely smash it
Let’s get it! See if you can have 100 popcorn chicken in 100 seconds
Damn beard, are you giving disastrous dumps after a challenge like this?
First!!
OMG This looks amazing!!! Now this is a "Regular" size meal lol
It's not Sunday without Beard!
Legend
Let’s gooo
Yes
Nice
My favourite time of the week!! Beard time!!
Good evening esteemed watchers! I hope you’re doing well and, as always, thanks for joining me for yet another episode…  I hope you enjoy it and I’ll catch you for the first episode in the Oklahoma series this Thursday!   ‘Til then, have a pancake or two 😘
Excellent work as always mr beard.
Love it.
