Dude Alonso is in his prime🫡
An diesem Tag hab ich die schönste Frau der Welt  kennengelernt.
this is what happens when you give verstappen a rocketship
Look at the picture Ike difference between the Redbull and every one else. But no one was complaining about their dominance, but they want to complain about McLaren. Everyone has their years of dominance.
Fun fact this was the top three for 2022 and 2023
Que asco que da ChOCON
Jk
ZHOの演技には笑えた😂
Perez was right
Just came here after horners comments about car upgrades😂. Max should had struggled here if the upgrades were bad
완벽한 우승  👏
Rb19 is a monster
I'm here to see how Max started from P1 in 2023 and kept his position, and Lando started from P1 2024 and lost 2 positions!

0:19 is russel driving through the long lap lane?
Gente
ocon should have got a penalty for running alonso into pit, if some one was exiting at that time, it would have been a huge crash
11th most watched 2023 highlights.
Great job by Mercedes to have both cars on the podium!! Disappointing for ferrari for Sainz to go from p2 on the grid, to a p5, and that Charles leclerc       Didn’t finish in the points.

Sadness for Mercedes
I've seen a million drives do what Yuki did there and no one has ever said the slightest word about it. Now it's a thing?
Not a fan of new commentary

Can the drivers drive on these tracks in the off season?
❤❤❤
Before I used to fall asleep during races. Nowadays I fall asleep watching recaps.
Max Verstappen on top baby! 💯💯💯
Lo mejor la fórmula uno en carreras ,vale la pena , saludos Emiliano de argentina
Strange how the commentators keep reminding us there’s actual overtaking
Boring year, Red Bull is way ahead of everyone else. F1 needs to do something to make the racing more exciting.
Why the heck is everyone saying it’s boring?
This RBR car ... never that much of superiority
Ótima corrida!
Powerful 💪🇺🇦
This championship is so ridiculously boring... The worst season ever!
Wow…Max wins…again….how exciting?
What a boring year so far lol
Mdr heureusement le premier mois après j'ai arrêté n'importe de quoi qui a mis le commentateurs même pas  professionnel pour la f1 tv 🤣🤣 les meilleurs c'est canal la c'est vraiment un débutant pour commenter
"Perez with a late lunge". Errr it was an undefended DRS overtake on a sister team car....
YUKI P9
Boring!!!!!
where watch f1 in brazil??
Russell great job
Hamilton coming up.. Beware
From this grand prix I'm keeping Mercedes performance with both Hamilton and Russell. The new upgrades seems to help, as about Ferrari, they have said that they have new upgrades as well but race by race Mercedes is becoming better than Ferrari. Red Bull still is very powerful the only team that can close the gap is Mercedes than Ferrari or Aston Martin. I can't wait for the Canadian Grand Prix.🏁🔥🏁🔥
what a race!!!!!
what a race!!!!!
what a race!!!!!
I have the f1 2021 video game boy is that cool loads of fun.
This race has been a deja vu for both series in terms of incidents:  -A mercedes, a prema, an hitech red bull and a jenzer ms going off in the first turn  -penalty collisions with an art gp x both hitech red bulls, alpha tauri x alfa romeo and hitech alpine x campos (also williams x trident with rodin carlin x var except it were hard ones) -Yellow flags into first and second sector by roy nissany and luke browning x leonardo fornaroli n hunter yeany x rafael villagomez  -Black & white flags for verstappen and maloney for track limits  -contact for crawford gregoire beganovic & norris back into the pits  -Fastest laps in the backfield by kush maini x checo perez  -both teams drivers going off the tracks (trident x rodin carlin x var)  If it this wasn't a blast i don't know what was better. I thought It would only be the collisions to mention. JUST WHAT A DAY IT WAS!
Bloguero
Well Alonso’s point streak is still alive at least.
In spanish should be Lobato
Que interesante la F1 que hubiera más competencia aquí en México
Boring....
the Spanish GP a snoozer as usual..
Commentry is not upto the mark like last year ..change the commentators
They really showed Zhou getting overtaken for like 4 times and not show any of his overtakes.
Total joke that penalty for Tsunoda.
My dream Loading...............
its not about the racer, its about the car. Redbull has a better engine than all of them
We're only half way thru the season and already odds of Max winning the championship is 99.9%
Uma das piores temporadas da f1, sem emoção pelas primeiras colocações, entreguem a taça de 3 vezes campeão para o Max. E tiram o DRS e que disputam na pista.
Pretty boring race. No one can beat Max Verstappen, there's hardly any overtaking anywhere on the track beside the the main straight despite the final chicane being removed, there weren't too many incidents (but not enough to deploy a safety car), and no rain to spice it up. Man, it's a little better watching those short highlights. 🥱
Who is this commentator
Breaking News: Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz thinking to move to WEC to win races in a Ferrari. 😂
Question- F 1 is trying to do its bit to global warming, this is not a rant, I drive a V10.  But, why are they going from Barcelona to Canada and back to Austria, who’s in charge of logistics 🤔
Yuki was P9. Give back points for him and his team. The penalty was absolutely ridiculous.
Bring Martin Brundle back
Romanilorrrrfff marile puteri mondiale adta fac ... voi cu dacia unde sunteti?  Stiti ce i a olo si cine? Dc va bagati ca mustele in lapte in discutiile celor de aici? Ei au alte subiecte ..
Duhh RB is getting even Sussier 😑
Zhou is the best！！！
Thanks for uploading the highlights in spanish commentary!! Gracias por subir los resúmenes en español!!
boring the dominance of verstappen... If you're a fan of f1, my 1/43 scale model formula 1 collection red bull and Mercedes is online.. Your feedback matters a lot
Add subtitles
When Russell cut the corner and touched the yellow line with the top left tire he was behind Piastri so he should have started behind him and not in front of him as the judges allowed, even though it is a very close situation the judges have the technology to prove it. You can check it by watching the start of the race and stop it when he touches the yellow line, Russell is behind Piastri. Another error of the judges.
How tf they get 8m worth of highlights from a race less entertaining than watching actual paint dry
Where is Crofty???
Yuki tho guys…..😢
W9w
Wow
Max balapan ambe angin😂
What a dangerous move by Ocon
Que bueno.
"These 3 are putting on a show" that commentary line was so satisfying 😌
Who are these commentators? Do they change ?  I was waiting for 0:01 the lights out and away we go
Bring croftey back
How did you find 8 min of highlights in this boring race?
Verstappen deserve every win.    Lewis Hamilton deserve nothing but only to lose the cheating rat for years get what he deserves and that is nothing.  The best thing is I don't hear any of the English supports now.    Let's keep it that way
Verstappen 💪
Love from Pune ❤️
It's cool to hear the crowd screaming in the race
It not the right car.
Russell should of been given a penalty for when he went off the track he had been behind Norris then he goes off and ends up in front of Norris
People who cry about how the penalty on Yuki was unnecessary clearly know jack about the rules. Perhaps they should go host their own championship
The maFIA is so incredibly unfair with the unapropriate penalty for Tsunoda! The stewards should be all suspended the were in the spanish GP! 😡🤬👿👿👿
Bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang bigbang
This lead commentators voice is annoying
Race was Great 👍
If yuki got the penalty for running a car off track, why not max verstappen in 2021 brazillian grand prix which was much more off a deliberate attempt?? So F1 is bending rules for max?
boooorring
Congrats kid ……
😊
I will call "Zhou" from now on "China chichen"!
The driver of the day award goes to the poor men and women who drove all the way to Barcelona to watch this snoozefest.
26 laps  out of a 66 lap race
MAX Car is Illegal this is not right.
To everybody crying about russell, where were you at the 2021 Russian gp when Alonso did the same? If you go around the bollard you dont get a penatly even if you pass 10 cars. How does nobody know that?
Cuánto recibió la FIA, la salida de Rusell no tiene justificación, nadie lo saco, decidió salir y hacer trampa no se merece haber subido al podio.  Por menos la FIA sanciona a otros, de que se trata es un chiste,  solo porque es  europeo, blanco, FIA son racistas, cuando en el deporte hay política, este deja de ser un deporte. Red Bull y otros equipos deberian mandar una inconformidad.
it's getting boring.
My favourite race of the season so far... Only marred by the unfortunate penalty for Yuki which saw him go out of the points
0:1 milliseconds, Verstappen world champion again, again , again and… Again
No se que tanta degradacion tenian los neumaticos de checo... pero creo que faltando 15 vueltas pudo haber terminado la carrera sin entrar a boxes... y ubiera quedado si no en 2o por lo menos si en tercero... !!!  .... ademas eran duros, no desgastaban igual que medios o blandos... que opinan???
Is it just me or no one can hear David crofte and Martin brundle commentary on these highlights?
Que bodrio hermano
Boring
Get crofty's version back, it's getting annoying now. It's just wierd without "its lights out and away we go".
Once Ferrari starts winning there won’t ever be another pole position. Ferrari will make F1 cease to exist because NOBODY can beat the best of all time.
Lewis backed out??? Mate, Lando was simply too eager and  he paid for it.
Whenever I want to know the outcome of a match in advance, I turn to AwakenBeerus. His prediction ability is unquestionable!
yuki fans 挺恶心的😂
YASSSSS MERCEDES IS BACK , LEWIS IS BACK'
Boring
Samuel 🇳🇬
I wonder if hamilton ever thinks "huh so this what the other felt all those years I dominated"
Boy we miss crofty,s voice 😢
For having more viewers day by day., As a non english speaker, I really hope there are some kind of subtitle or captions on this channel.. please understand that people are trying to enjoy this sport, this small improvement might give a huge impact on F1..
I haven't even watched this race yet but let me guess max won?
Another boring gp
Dominate
I think this was like the sixth race where all cars finished???
Don't like f1 commentators.....un subscribe..sorry
So boring now
Something is terribly wrong right now at the Ferrari garage. Pace aside, the strategy, the communications and the lack of will to win need immediate attention. We need the iron fist of marchionne!
Mercedes go to podium
F1 needs Andretti or another team,so few cars for this super reliable era
Let’s go, Hamilton!
Zhou’s fan here, didn’t expect that 5 sec penalty for Tsunoda either 😂😂😂
Quien más vino aquí por Shakira 😊
Boring
Nothing personal, but who's this annoying commentator in the beginning? Not the usual one
Gracias por poner los comentarios en español!
Please stop with the Alex Jacques nonsense. Get Croft back. I bet if you did a poll to choose between the two of them, it’s obvious who will the clear winner be.   Why the stubbornness?
Fica sem graça saber que o campeão já é o Verstappen,  algo precisa mudar urgente.
Toto face looks bright 😂
Just a boring race
F1 means unFair 1.
Commentateur ennuyeux , cela fait longtemps qu’il nous barbe …
Anyone would think, watching these highlights, that the Spanish Circuit only has one corner.   "Cars passing left right and centre" - literally all on one corner 🤦
F1 has come to a point that even the highlights of a race are boring.
Verstappen, the new MSC 👌
that's how FIA steal from yuki points... what a shame for FIA...
Hamilton 💪
bro no one used to watch formula 1. now its popping like crazy. also this is the most boring era in F1 ever. people are weird AF
Perez not faster of George Russel
is it me or has this season been boring?
Red bull damage the car of Checo Perez for NO win Vestappen again
It's wird how Russel didn't get a penalty. So weird
How far max leave behind the 2nd place😮
No DRS !!!!
If yuki got a penalty verstappen should have gotten a penalty on the first lap
If Verstappen did what Tsunoda did.... it will be called "motor sport"
So boring up front. All the action happen at middle group.
Ferrari and their master class "winning strategy".
The Fia said to Yuki it's not aloud to race.
糞だなFIA
Mercedes climbing to the top🔥
Do F1 cars use the same engine for the same Company??For example Sergio perez do not match Verstappen's car for almost all the race this season...or it depends with the driver's ability?
Super Master Max
Boring
K S. he has no heart
Can someone explain how max is not even is the video? How is he always winning? And what is interval? Cheers
Mercedes back in the front row seems the upgrades paid off. Red bull still has another level of pace compared to the others so a one horse race regardless.
DRS has is not fair … both cars should be allowed to open DRS to see fair fight
BORING❤
Another great result for Ferrari.
Stroll making Alonso typical starts... 💪🏽
get rid of this commentator
SUPER MAX 🏆🏆🏆
Que aburrimiento
Think Max shd begin to start at mid field so that he could get some actions in overtaking instead of getting far ahead racing against the winds...😂😂😂
Who is commentating? This isn't Crofty
The spanish gp in barcelona is always the same. The same overtakings, mercedes and red bull strong and on podium (as usual in barcelona). They can pause this gp for a year
Me da dolor de cabeza escuchar a tornello hasta por YouTube
Great job Leclerc … keep it up ! 😂😂😂
6:59 シルバーアロー、復権なるか？
6:16 こりゃいわれたらユウキがね。…
Only 40 wins? After all these years? Really?  40? Vancrashagain, thats really fairly poultry....😂😂😂😂with all of the conniving, and you're not even in the ball park yet😅😅😅😅😅😅...well, maybe we'll give you a couple more years of victories under safety cars, or 1 lap escorts in torrential rain winner declarations...40 wins😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅
Am I the only one who prefer sky sport commentary over this there’s something about this main commentary guy throat that hurt my ear.
Great parade from Max and RBR! Great race, FIA (NOT)!!! Just give the 2023 title to them and stop waisting people's time with a so called race. 😂
Race Hightligts, best berkata nonton live wkwkwkw, F1 grand prix
Not even worth watching. At least Indycar went from the 500 to what was more a go kart track than a street course on the weekend.
You cant win a F1 race if you are afraid to overtake the nasty dutch boy. Bunch of chickens. 🤣
These races are getting more and more boring. We're about a third into the season and we can already say who is the driver and constructor champion. The best battles are for tenth place. Bring back in season testing. I actually watched Indy car this weekend and enjoyed it more.
Fk boring sport with the same winner all the time. 👎 Once the dutch boy is in front you can stop watching this nonsense.
Yuki: the penalty is a JOKE, A JOKE THE FIVE SECONDS
"Alonso dont pass Stroll, or you are fired! Stay behind."
Мерсы всё таки сделали по одному ред буллу и феррари!
p9，zhou！！！！！
That Redbull car is super fast, Mercedes 24  seconds behind on medium tires whilst Redbull was on hard
Eat, 😴, take pole and win: MV
How you salvaged 8 minutes of highlights from this race?
george passed like 5 people but yuki gets the penalty
hatestappen
Leclerc
Sengit
f1 is getting so boring 😢
Is it just me or does Crofty and brundle just sound better on commentary?
WHERES THE RACE HIGHLIGHTS WITH DAVID CROFT???
There's literally over 100 overtakes and I saw plenty of battles, but STILL these idiot fans are saying that it was boring???? Can you just find another sport, because you're boring.....  we all knew that Max would dominate this race. It is what it is. Accept it.
How could you fill 8 minutes with highlights? Formula 1 became boring. Bring back the horsepower we had in the old days (1200-1400pk) and fuel pitstops. Each driver is driving on the 99 percent car limit. They need cars they cannot fully handle.
Kembali ke sircuit yg begitu menantang setelah sekian balapan jalanan yg membosankan
Why didn’t you show Max’s fastest lap?
so. is it allowed to go over the white line of the vox exit?
2:59 "so close, papers width" meanwhile the parts are flying from the contact..
I miss crofty
GR
I don't like seeing 2 Mercedes on podium. What's going on with Checo?
在第一视角看来，周冠宇是会觉得要被撞上了。yuki有点冤，但不是没有道理的。不过，我觉得周冠宇需要再猛一些。😊
+Highlight guys,😮 i find New singer ??? Title : Sang Juara Artist : Avatara Veergha  Ethnic Dayak From Kalimantan Island,Indonesia. (Check Now)💯
6:11 He is clearly avoiding himself. I'm still not satisfied with that result.
Ferrari this season is not doing well
If Lewis was p2 he could’ve taken the lead. But would’ve lost it because he had softs. But the gap would not have been 20. Our pace was like 10x better than Aston and Ferrari. Gap to redbull would’ve been like 10-15 which is amazing considering last year and this year for Mercedes
That penalty on Yuki was BS
I thought they changed the rules of overtaking and defending in 2022 to accommodate Max's style of driving🤔 so then how come Yuki got a penalty for doing what Max does all the time???????

wheres crofty and brundle?
i like that high speed corner
Que viva la Formula Uno 🏎️🏎️🏎️🎉🎉🎉🎉
Pero respecto a George Russel nadie dice nada sobre cómo logró el tercer lugar en el podio. George Russell en el arranque tomó la chicana y así ganó 4 posiciones y la FIA curiosamente ahora no vió nada. ¿Por qué tampoco nadie ha puesto una queja formal ante la FIA?  ¿Deja más estar en pequeños chismes entre escuderías? En este video solo le echan porras como va superando ¿y sobre su trampa què? Le pongo un cero perfecto a este comentarista.
minardi   arrows   jordan   benetton   prost  jaguar   :(
No surprise,  red bull again, yawn!
They need to do something about the lack of actual RACING! I love F1 but the fact that Verstappen wins by +/- 24 seconds almost every race is getting old! I like Max, Lewis and all the drivers but the lack of racing at the front is (IMO) going to lose viewership...
this is the first highlight where it was just on the start finish straight and turn 1
when they say getting past doesn't it mean you're being overtaken?
more than 20 seconds difference between max and the others, this is unbelievable, not wanting to belittle the effort of max or rbr but I miss being surprised with fights for 1st place
i don't like that comentator i hope that comentator with English version
Forza Leclerc 🥺🥺
Wow, no red flag and no pointless safety car. Liberty must be slipping in their quest for fakery.
Get in there lewis.....
Hermoso en españoll
20+ secs gap to runner up? Such a bad time for F1 for gaining new fans to the sport.
Now we can watch the video in 720p50
Mega race from Lewis.
Congratulations to Max Verstappen for his third f1 world championship in a row. A legend already, unstoppable. Cry checo fanboys, cry...
Cara, eu tô sentindo falta da narração do David Croft. O que aconteceu?
I don't get it. So if someone is attempting to pass you on the outside you gotta put your brakes on and let em? Why was tsnunofa penalized
It's crazy this year well I guess could even say the trend to some extent started already last year but this year showing through more so...All Ferrari run teams seem like they can extract great pace on Saturdays but in race trim just fall off A LOT, which is weird because we all know yes PU is part of it but there's sooo many other factors that make a F1 car and Alfa, Ferrari and Haas all kind of have gone their own direction as far as body work side pods, floor obviously and aero bits. It's just wild though because you can see Ferrari well Charles more often then Carlos pop out this crazy lap in Quali and fight for pole, then you see Haas pump out some amazing laps on Saturdays Hulk has been genius at getting that car to shine over one lap but fall completely away on Sundays..Alfa is really the only one who hasn't had this wild Quali pace where it's like where did that come from but still oddly they Quali alot better then in race trim and it's the Ferrari powered cars on grid who are capable of just extracting something out of the car over one lap but then full tank race pace absolutely nowhere ...just odd to me in all the years I've watched either you know what your PU is capable of and your package as a whole and it was for most part status quo stayed consistent. It's been a strange couple of years with these new era cars..wish we could get this dream mix of this last gen merged somewhat with this gen other then wipe slate clean and go down this road I'm not a complete fan of these cars as a whole..when we're literally stripping away liveries for exposed carbon just to save that bit of weight because these cars are so big and heavy. Yes Redbull absolutely got it right and I don't think it's down to something simple like side pods or floor I think it's everything as a whole and the way it all works in harmony they just nailed it which is why when we see someone just copy their side pods or whatever don't see a massive performance gain and why Redbull aren't sweating they know that everyone has no clue or even close to being on the right scent of their magic.
Awesome video Gratulation’s’s
Lando norris should go back to go karting 🤣🤣🤣
From now on is legal to pass cars and take advantage from outside the main track, thanks to FIA, Mercedes and G. Russell.😮
Boring as always, nothing new here
I ese fallo de la realidad en el minuto 5
Un podio más robado por la FIA y Mercedes a Checo Pérez y Red Bull !! George Rusell tomó 2 lugares de ventaja indebida por la línea de escape y debió haber sido sancionado por la FIA haciéndose occisos. A partir de esta carrera ya es legal adelantar lugares por fuera las pista? 😮
Boreing
GO MAX!
Red Bull gonna get caught cheating again
Gripping season. So many surprises. Who knows who will win the 2023 championship.
Are we back silver arrows or are you playing with our hearts
Thank goodness fans are not stewards based on this comments section
I'm sorry to say it but F1 is an absolute snorefest. Do yourself a favour and watch motoGp. I nearly fell asleep watching the highlights nevermind the actual race. I used to enjoy watching F1 now it's just boring. More exciting to watch the Netflix series.
Verstappen wins. 🥱
O patrão muito humilde comemorando o segundo lugar 👏👏👏
Can't believe that kick is a sponsor for Alfa Romeo
Max is like yeee another win.
At this point, Red Bull is just spamming the wins! 😂
max if he did more his best could outlap each driver, even if he would start in the back he would still win, Checo drives same car so can not just be the car. Anyways Max isn’t a subject here..bit strange
ME GUSTA MUCHO COMO NARRA DON FERNANDO Y JUAN , SOLO QUE EL HECHO DE PROTEJER LA MANIOBRA DE RUSSEL , POR LOS COMISARIOS Y UDS NO EJERCER PRESION, SI MOLESTA. YUKI Y ZHO TUVIERON CASI UN TOQUE Y ZHO LO EVITO SALIEDO DE LA PISTA; SOLO QUE A ZHO LO EMPUJO YUKI Y SE VE CLARO, A RUSELL IBA SOLO Y DECIDIO SALIR PARA AVENTAJAR, MAS CLARO NO SE PUEDE , EL TERCER LUGAR LE PERTENECE A CHECO LE GUSTE O NO.
Max lucky
Max and Red Bull champions again this season.
Does someone know how many pit stops did Russell and Hamilton
why video 1080p50fps? total bad video
hey that jazz about making the cars even. fail.
R ussell came out in front of piastri, he should have returned the position, he didn't,  that deserved a penalty but he was shamelessly helped. Why?  That podium was stolen by Russell and the FIA.
i was there and it was a nice weekend but there where a lot of people - way to much... we were on track at 7:30 am and all was full... well we found a place in turn 10 to watch at a big screen and see a little bit of turn 10 but some people just sitting on the ground and saw nothing.. no screen or part of track. rly sad u paid like 200€ for sitting on ground and see nothing... they should not sell that much tickets. btw the race was super boring.
Max doing great would be much more palatable if Red Bull had put in an effective second driver who made things competitive. Max will suffer from the Michael Schumacher problem of having second-tier wingmen throughout the duration of his wins. Hamilton had Alonso, Button, and Rosberg who were all competitive (bar Bottas), showcasing Hamilton's talents. I think if Max had Lando, Alonso or Le Clerc as co drivers, it would show his greatnesss (I think he wins against all three ). Red Bull are playing it too safe when they know they have the best car till 2026.
Which other mclarren fan is suffering after this
And what about the rest of the track? Did absolutely nothing happen outside the main straight and turn 1?
Where's crofty at
That Tsunoda penalty was utter BS
these new cars made formula 1 very boring!
Boring
Well done, de Vries. I hear MacDonalds is looking for new employees.
Più guardo la f1e più mi ricorda gli anni di vettel, la red bull è troppo forte e chiunque la guidi è sempre li davanti , non centra Verstappen ,centra la macchina.
Zzzzz
Please bring DAVID CROFT back!
Yuki well deserved that penalty. 色色一一
It’s so clear that George overtook piastri off track it isn’t even funny. No 5 second penalty though 🤷‍♂️
go mercedes.
I get sad everytime I remember it's not the old narratod
The arguments of the "It's the car" screamers boils basically down to; 'Max is just a machine, it's his car that is insanely talented". lol.
That penalty against Tsunoda made no sense.
スチュワードは自分のマヌケさを少しは恥じたらどうなんだ？ この問題は過去から今まで全く改善されずに定期的に起きている、何度も裁定を間違えてはその度に叩かれている。 こいつらバカなのか？
O Carlos não tem colhõeis
That McLaren livery 🔥🔥
Russell overtaing Hulk and Piastri in 1st corner out of track: "I gained no advantage" LOL, then Yuki got penalty for this? :DDDD FIA Marshal Clowns
Does anybody feel weird that the race doesnt start with" LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO"
YUKI's Mega Breaking. Is F1 a Penalty Paradise?
of all the races that have been running, and he is again the winner. 😂😂😂😂 Pinocio of Motorsport 😂😂😂
This season has been an absolute snooze fest. At least during Mercedes dominance, Ferrari and Red Bull would still win a few races a year and be contenders most races. This is ridiculously boring. They were showing racing for 15th-18th most of the race 😴
Yuki done nothing wrong man
Ferrari is so finished
What is wrong with the comment section regarding Yuki? Zhou was literally ahead of Yuki on apex, 1 car rule means that Yuki has to leave him a space for him to stay on track but didn't. Y'all too used to apex blocking in F1 games lol
Ferrari no gd 👎
Blessings, John 3:16.  Jesus loves you.
Even the highlights are boring for this race
for racing downforce is important, just like racing game the less sensivity the more stiff the handling of the car, the fast the acceleration of the car
french commentating is something else lowis amilton snz and greenstappen
Wich game is this... beautifull CGI these day's😃
Yuki's penalty was a joke! For what? For racing?! The sport might get boring if you aren't even allowed to defend your position...
We need music instead of a commentator voice. Increase hype for the race through music.
Mercedes found what they were looking for? Or is it only the beginning 🤔 time will tell
Race was over after turn 1.
Tsunoda getting a peno for taking a corner the same way verstappen does anytime someone tries him round the outside
Ferrari change your engine, use ford
No penalty for LH? Again?
Más pruebas de que Verstapen es mil veces mejor que Pérez y me encanta Pérez pero hay que ser realista🤷y si Mercedes sigue mejorando su objetivo no será ni Verstapen ni Hamilton sino el Tercel lugar con Rosel.
Ridiculous penalty for Yuki
Yuki received a penalty for what! Total BS.
There's no competition for the championship this series is snooz fest with red bull dominating. I stopped watching when merc was doing that
Why crofty isnt comentating can someone explain to me pls
It was all turn 1
Comedy review got there first
why TSUNODA penalty?
Hel-lo Mercedes! C'mon c'mon let me see your underside c'mon...
Yuki didnt deserve a penalty  He didn't even turn into Zhou, he legit just too the racing line. 6:18  Brazil 2021 Verstappen drives lewis off the road @ turn 4 and even went miles off the road and no investigation was necessary. Formula 1 has no consistency
Max verstappen king in makin'g
Dutch, Max fan. Driver of the day… Lewis!!
I hope everyone has an amazing day if your see this 💜
F1 without Ferrari?  no thanks. Useless !
still can't believe y'all are using this commentator for race highlights now :/
Really miss that v10 v12 sounds 😢
😎😎🏁
What the f**k did you do with the english commentator?????
Have you guys notice there is just only turn 1,2,3 that shared in this video? I mean we supposed want to watch how was the action at the other turn?
Tf was leclerc’s strategy, they started him off with hard coming from the pits only to box him mad early for softs and then back to hards

Bon ça Lewis
Please post highlights in Brazilian Portuguese again 😭🤯😭
what highlights? these are just footage of DRS overtaking
The fact that Max wasnt even pushing the whole race and still had the enourmous gap makes me wonder just how much more pace he and that car have
Cringe Cringestappen
No way Ocon's defense was ok but not Yuki's
It's shocking that they got this video to 8 minutes in length
When you cant overtake Max with Softs you know RB will win every single race this season
did they change the commentator?
Mercedes are back!
From now on, with late braking, go a little forward from the out If you run away to escape, the opponent will get a 5 second penalty. If only the FIA ​​was consistent:)
Yuki: stays on track, penalty Max: drives off the track, no investigation necessary
Sorry guys, boring even in the 8 minutes version 😅
Watched the whole race on sky sports and mann croftys commentry is 1000 better. He makes the race more interesting to watch
not gonna lie max winning is getting a bit boring
alonso vs ocon had me thinking of alonso vs stroll last year, but reversed cars
I don’t understand if FIA wants drivers to race or not. That penalty on Yuki was simply sad.
idiot Monkey team Red Bull & Idiot Max
Max won by 23 sec...
NO FIA
Yuki 5sec penalty for that?
What did we learn this race.. Georgie can cry bs but when its up to him he rather wont break but go over the white line , what counts as a wall..  and ofc. sky claims its fine bc its a brit that does it..  so boy georgie won atleast 1 place, Norris.. And bc boy georgie can do it, Every one else can do it from now on..  Look that makes it all more fun.. as cheating is allowed..
Penalty on Yuki was utterly out of order. Yuki had the corner. Zhou couldn't make it stick. It was racing. Plain and simple.
Lets go Mercedes ❤❤
I fell asleep watching the race
So they just raced to the first corner 😅
Camera angles and those flying shots really made the cars look like they're actually going how fast they're going, superb!
bad video,,the camera always focus on the riders fifth below,focus on the top to fifth place,,why focusing on tenth place
Bring back sky sports commentary please
F1 is becoming boring and predictable. Losing fans and their interest.
Ocon just seems to really hate Alonso specifically.
接触もしてないのに5秒ペナ。 不公平感が否めない。F1を一気につまらなくさせる裁定。FIAは日本人嫌いですか？
Even with Catalunya back to its 1996 layout, its still 1 star.
ＦＩＡ　ＹＯＵ　ＡＲＥ　WRONG
missing crofty🥲
its getting boring now! Max is running away with it, and the spread is more then what makes a race exciting.  Race control is atrocious,, they should be thinking entertainment first not preventing drivers from racing
Have they made turn 1 tighter?
Yuki is P9. What a facking penalty👎
Mercedes going back to podium. They has fixed the problem.
Not a DRS fan but it did its job well here, lots of fun braking zone attacking and defending in T1.
Driver of the day for Lec plz
What's up with the guy screaming like it's the last lap?
Massive amounts of yawn
Redbull and max easy win again this season… F1 can get abit stale through these periods of dominance by a team
Boring boring boring that no one can stop Verstappen
Boring after first turn. Could the worst driver win in the best car ?
Max is simply cruising to the title, even more so than last year it seems. No other teams to worry about, no team mate to worry about and no reliability issues to worry about.
Verstappen is wonderful, but its just becoming repetitive. Whats the point in watching if the same team and person is going to win each time?
wtFerrari??
FIA is a joke, F1 is gone
Purtroppo Leclerc non c'è,ma Sainz da speranza... La guida della rossa se la e guadagnata sul campo,il primo pilota dovrebbe essere Sainz
Honestly how boring is this sport now verstappen wins before the race starts
Yuki's penalty is a disgrace for the sport. An absolute joke, his steering never moved out to push Zhou.
Leclerc and your ferrari
F1 is starting to look like the NRL now. Rigged.
The eyes of the FIA ​​are knotholes😅
We really went from , “ITS LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO” , to idek what that was
Enjoyed the highlights, just didn’t like the commentary.
race highlights ...the race was over after the first curve...
Why FIAmilton didn't get a penalty fot that move?
I don't like the f1 since this guy is always first!!!
Verstappen and RBR winner in 11 race
Warwick is P100
because the spanish gp was so boring the FIA decided to pick on yuki just for  thr fun of it
Pretty boring really. At the moment it VER and everyone else.
角田のペナルティの意味が分からない。
Yuki got penalty because he is Japanese.
Great Fittipaldi !
max didn’t get a penalty in brazil 2021 but yuki gets one here how silly
Yuki got penalty and Rusell?
Very lovely 😊
Yuki gets a penalty but Esty bestie didn't get one.. Talk about inconsistency
The FIA proved to be an amateur.
It's funny how the coverage of the race barely talked about Red Bull.... maybe some Red Bull hating going on
Lewis Hamilton become a nightmare for Lando Norris..
Devries getting slower every race. Replace monkeyboy plz.
the stewards should be ex f1 drivers not these morons who know nothing about F1 racing
How did Yuki get a 5 second pen for that? Zhou had room.
今年からF1を見始めた素人の自分でも角田のペナルティには違和感を感じざるを得なかった…😢
Yuki penalty when I looked at it a couple of times is dumb. Zhou`s car snapped to the side off the track it's self 😢
Spain is the best country in the world 🇪🇸
Feel bad for Norris
Thank You Very Much F1 for putting this summary in Spanish with THESE commentators ,,THANK You!!;  I am from México,  but I prefer THESE commentators than those from México that Fox Sports IMPOSED! , Thanx Again!!! 👍
Everyone used to complain about Merc always winning.  This is 10x more boring.
Russell test the 2024 track layouts on turn 1
worst commentary
00:52 he sounded like Mimir a bit
Red Bull Red Bull Red Bull - Boring
Max vs lewis in brazil no penalty but yuki does
Yuki obviously run on the correct line and Zhou took himself course out literally. That penalty was ridiculous and there is illicit money going on behind the scenes, right?
Wow, so boring.
Lando messing up that P3 is hilarious 😂 what a dope! P3 to P17 only the way McLaren can Yuki's penalty is silly, Ocon needed a big penalty for that late turn in on Alonso -_-
Happy to see Mercedes back on pole ❤❤
Missed its light out and away we go immediately
Boring race
What terrible commentary
角田選手への裁定はおかしい
7:15 SHOUT TO THE SOUTH AFRICANS OUT THERE 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦  AMAZING RACE
The best stratagy for Ferrari is not to think of any stratagy. Or the same fit-stop timing and tire choice for Red Bull
Alonso THE BEAST!!
Why aren't Crofty und Brundle commenting the races anymore?
Nefasta la organización y los 3 “cuerpos” de policías Pensando un evento tan grande. Un desastre, ojalá que abandonen hacerlo en Barcelona hasta tanto no modifiquen los responsables. Que repiten, calla, porque saben que son de pandereta. Es triste, porque sé que pueden hacerlo…pero el resultado es Pilotos llegando a pie, directivos, sin poder acceder rápidamente.
I just want to hear "Lights out and away we go" again.😔
I don‘t get why sainz didn‘t take more risk in turn 1 in his home GP.  Everybody seems to be week next to max in a fight
I woke up too early today, thank you for helping me back to sleep :)
Can you please change the commentators back to ted and Martin brundle so hard to listen to
Guys they released Ocon emoji:🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀
I miss the 2021 season. Every race is super boring...
I would guess F1 are getting worried as to how boring this is getting for spectators when the lead car goes from start to finish without any drama. They should consider BTCC rules to balance up the cars?
So the race highlights are basically a compilation of DRS overtakes into T1. Awesome.
When Verstappen did it the whole season in 2021 why he was never given a penalty? And now yuki took 5 seconds penalty straight away?
Great race for second today 😂
2:59 Papers width? I see debris flying from De Vries' car... they touched!
Still boring.
SUPER MAX
What a drive from these two mercedes, what a week end ! 💜💙
Out of the 23 highlights 19 are DRS overtakes on the main straight.  Make of that what you will.  "AnD wE rEaLlY ArE sEeInG tHiS mUcH oVeRtAkInG"
why did he get a penalty, kinda seemed he was turning and zhou just over reacted
Most boring F1 race yet with the most annoying speaker ever.
Estie Bestie is not in the podium, baby
Who's this skudbook commentator man get in the bin
El checo es el mejor piloto 😮
HamVerBott 2.0
Max with the win again. Did not see that coming..;/ just joking. Man he prob gets all the ladies he ever wanted.. plus he's a deadly driver  But he will never grow a half decent beard or moustache in his whole life. I wonder what Nigel Mansell is up to these days?
There can be no penalty for Tunoda. Tunoda had space on the bottom side; Zhou Guan Yew simply could not keep up with the competition and went off course. The cars did not even hit each other. Why does the FIA make unfair rulings as if they were pressured from the outside? If this was a penalty, Verstappen, Hamilton, Leclerc, Russell, and Alonso would have been penalized many times this year alone. If this were a penalty, the only way they would be able to swap places would be for refueling or car trouble. There are not many rulings that are this ridiculous.
Ferrari just botched their strategies again in this race, haven't they? Honestly, I don't know why they bother with the Softs anymore. It hasn't worked for them since mid last season. It didn't give them any pace advantage, and they couldn't make it last as long as Ham and George did with theirs. And then there's Charles starting on Hards only to box earlier than everybody else...
This is getting quite boring
The rainium in Spainium falls mainly from the cranium …  😂😂😂
So Ocon can defend fiercely and basically push Alonso on the pitlane but Yuki get a penalty for that
please can we get the old commentators.........
Mercedes!!!
fia, can you do better?
Bring back croft's voice
Ban for penalties
Even the MV Red Bull race crew sound bored now. They shouldn’t be. They have a great car and a driver on the way to being in the GOAT category. Celebrate the wins because you never know when they will end 👍
I missed moment of Verstappen's mechanics changing tires because I blinked my eyes
The Fia played blind eye to George Russell's cheating at the corner exit at the start of the race. That's how anyone can advance by cheating. So what are the rules for?
"A paper's width between these two.", he says while watching a replay with debris scattering... :D
Well, that was boring.
Something I have forgot that we need more Safeties Cars🚙
It is a discriminatory ruling against the Japanese.
Every overtake was into turn 1 after the drs😴
Where is the lights out and way we go guy
Love F1
Yuki deserve POINT, what a joke 😢
Zero-side pods will go down in history as one of the worst mods to any Mercedes car.
F1は中国に媚びてんのか👎
Why isn’t crofty commentating in these highlights but he is commentating in the live race!!!
Con Canapino en la Indycar volví a seguir más a la categoría y la verdad la F1 no tiene ni para empezar  con lo que a espectáculo se refiere.  F1 Aburridisima
Max Grand Slam?
boringgg
Boring race
Another exhilarating race with an unexpected winner. Edge of your seat stuff.  Sorry, this comment was meant for GT World Series my bad
3:22 That Red bull sounds like a Formula E car
I think Ferrari took away Sainz's 'VAMOS' in this game
David Croft and Martin Brundle had better commentary
Never watched a race with so many overtakes yet boring. Most of the moves were down the straight ,turn 1 or turn 2. Jmo
Lol lando got actually recked
Brilliant for max....Yuki really shouldn't of got a penalty for driving well he held his position and stuck to the race line it was zhou that should of pulled back and gave the room
This is becoming cliche now. Perez needs to step it up. He's the only one out there who's got any chance against Max.
Annoying narration
this won't play for me. Says video unavailable?
Boring
Trust me Yuki totally deserved that penalty. Alonso would wag the finger at him.
carlos sainz should defend for p3,,, poor noris and tsunoda,,
All you can see a real Race, no fake pass, Touch and push up   IndyCar race in Detroit on this weekend was sick
The Mercedes cars are starting to look awesome now
Highlights? Where? Seen a few cars passing at one corner maybe every seven laps or so. What happened? All the other cameras not working? ...
There's no contact on with Yuki and Zhou and Yuki got5 sec penalty...  but what about dangerous defense of Ocon?
Lando is Just Heartbreak😢😢
Mercedes ❤
😵‍💫
Every time depression strikes me I remind myself that at least I am not a Ferrari fan...
arrrgggh carlos could pass him, HE WAS GREAT!!! MERCEDES MEEEEEEGA RACE, LANDO UNLUCKY BUT HE WILL RECOVER IN CANADA. NOW lets see if the continuous max winning will not be in canada😊😊😊😊 AND ONCE AGAIN SPAIN NEVER DISSAPOINTS, SOLID RACE🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩👏👏👏👏👏👏
Booringgggg
You always need to leave a space, all the time you have to leave a space
after 2 season f1 is boring again
私は日本人でもちろん角田の事を応援していますが、ペナルティは少し仕方ないと思っています。 そもそもミディアムで最後のロングスティントを走り切ると判断したチームが間違っていたと考えています。 雨が降り、タイヤのラバーが失われいつも以上にタイヤに攻撃的なサーキットになっていました。 しかしながらタイヤはハードは1セットしかなかったので不運な部分もあったと思います。 角田は良くディフェンスしましたが無理やり抑えている感じもあり、残りの周回を考えても抑えきるのは難しかったでしょう。  私のささやかな願いを言うならば、ペナルティは５秒ではなく２秒であって欲しかった。 もう一つ言いたいことはチームが角田にポジションを周に譲れと言って欲しかったとも思います。 なぜならチームはこの件に関して大した抗議はしていないからです。 抗議をしていないという事はあれはペナルティでも仕方ないと判断しているという事、それならば譲るように言うべきでした。
Indycar out did f1 this weekend
A great race (now that everyone has let Max go) so now we’ve got great racing between the following drivers!
Finally Ferrari have invented something new. The introduction of downgrades.
as a proud bias Dutchman i am so amazed at Max's talent..love at the start right after the first turn Max speeds away...he is by far right now unbeatable, and i found it a bit weird the lack of showing Max ....
Yuki was given not only 5sec but one penalty point which proves how the stewards are inconsistent.
Anyone here remember: HAM BOT VER
This season is very born
Poor Leclerc 😢😢, he only made one mistake in this grand prix, driving a Ferrari
Ferrari has to compete with bullock carts. Lousy really!
Kali ini Lewis Hamilton membuat perlawanan terhadap Red Bull racing. Salut e juga untuk Alonso.
I am happy Mercedes is back. 😅
The guy from belgium did it again!
No DNF or SC. F1 needs Goatifi.
Im happy to see hamilton at the podium
Boring race
I miss Crofty and Martin
Bro can we have at least three races were Max does don't win please
BOOOORING😈😈😈
Mercedes! Let’s go
Another shame race for the ferrari ahhaahha
Please F1  Make 2 pitstops mandatory.  Makes it much more greater with different stategies.  Shows that its a teamsport and not individuelal
Ocon will never learn how to defend s position correctly according to the rules.
Unlucky Lando 😢
guys, there's bein sports race highlight with crofty.
Where is that Ferrari driver from monaco? 🤣🤣🤣Ahh his formula is too slow ✌️
Im Japanese. Im crying. My favorite F1 has gone somewhere. F1 was not "racing"
la verdad mucha tecnologia y todo pero a mi parecer tanto dominio del mismo es muy aburrido
WHERE ITS CROFTY????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ok...for me..Leclerc..can go out from Ferrari...was the First driver of Ferrari...and from a few GPs...Sainz drives Better than Leclerc and even both has the sale car... Ferrari have tò improve...bit Leclerc...can go out....
Justice for Yuki he should not have gotten that penalty
Another max win surprise
Why is merc on top ?
BS penalty for Yuki. And Ocon unpunished!
Kejuaraan ini hanya milik Redbull,podium 2 bahkan mungkin 3 yg akan di perebutkan tim lain.. Pemenangnya itu2 saja,jadi yg menang tak akan merayakan dengan sensasional..😁
Russell really just gone off the track and overtook 5-6 cars…💀
Well done Max....no woke rainbow helmet needed
「悪の組織FIA」さん角田くんの判定はおかしくないですか？ あっそうそうオコン選手にもちゃんとペナだしましょうね。 気分悪い月曜日ありがとう！☺
Did Ferrari show up?
😴😴😴
As much as it hurts me to say this after a brilliant race by Yuki, he totally deserved the penalty.  That was avoidable
New resolution for Ferrari,i am waiting for so long since Schumacher era
Mercedes making a come back???
Penalty a bit too harsh? Maybe. Penalty is inconsistent? Maybe. Yuki gave enough space? You are blind.  Guillaume Dezoteux (Head Of Vehicle Performance) "Unfortunately, while defending Zhou in Turn 1, he didn’t leave enough space at the apex and received a five-second penalty for this, ending up P12."
角田へのペナルティはおかしい！これではバトルできないよ。
Ferrari silent mode😢😢
Yuki was clearly at fault. It was plain silly for him to lose points.
Welcome back AMG
Max is going full villain arc “The Flying Dutchman”
What iy this commenfary ahahaha
perez doing perez things. Pathetic.
Where is crofty??
F1 is very boring nowadays…
What happened to Leclerc? I thought he was at least going to get some points..
Every single pass using DRS on straight into Turn 1. Utterly dull.
Heureusement qu'il est possible de couper le son. Les commentaires sont stupides.
What a boring as race. Cant lie this season has turned out underwhelming. Started off entertaining and now its just... ehh
I strongly protest against the penalty to Tsunoda. It is an unfair and negligent deliberation, and an abuse of authority.
Alfa need to change their livery - it's so easy to confuse as a Ferrari from a far
Turn 1 simulator 😂
Worst race of the year so far
What is the point of watching if verstappen wins every race? This is just as bad as nascar and the stupidity they have in their series!
Brillant overtake by Gasly on De Vries 👌🏻
Another F1 nailbiter, lol
im in an absolute pain right now (im a gigalonso fan)
Disaster ferrari management wts wrong
great 2-3 for silver arrows but we want 1-2 foe mercedes
unfair judge.
Bruh who is this commentator? Why is he so bad? Just let us have crofty!!!!
It is interesting because, just like in a soccer game, the exact same play can be a no-whistle, a foul by the attacker, or a foul by the defender, depending on the referee and players.
People yapping about the penalty for yuki but i am wondering why noone is chatting about russel cutting the track and comming back ahead of piastri whilst he was behind comming into t1
Yeah.. one car at a time..  Go Mercedes..❤❤❤
I cannot understand and accept the penalty given to Tsunoda. His braking was superb, beyond Zhou's expectations, and it seems like he just went off track on his own. This is a normal race, and Tsunoda simply displayed excellent driving skills. I felt that this decision was unfair. 角田へのペナルティは理解できず、受け入れられません。彼のブレーキングは素晴らしく、周の予想を超えており、彼自身がトラックを外れただけのように見えます。これは普通のレースであり、ツノダは単に優れたドライビングスキルを示しただけです。私はこの決定が不公平だと感じました。 I believe that once a decision has been made regarding this ruling, it is essential to treat all drivers fairly and impartially.
Further proof of double standards in stewardship - if Verstappen got a penalty everytime he'd done that, he'd still have zero championships.
Yawner compared with Indycar these days.
It always drives me crazy to hear the commentators brag about all of the overtaking when 95% of the passes are completely unearned DRS overtakes.  This is not racing!
おいおい、この角田ペナルティのシーン、何故ペナルティなんだ？ 周の車両感覚が壊れているだけじゃーないのか！
Más aburrido como nunca
Ça ne ressemble plus à rien ces grands prix!un mec seul et les autres à 30 secondes voir 1 tour..nullissime..ou sont les ferrari ?les mercedes, les alpines  et les autreS?peut être qu'ils ne savent plus faire de voiture..😢😢😢😢
cause collision with norris, use lap1-8 to re overtake lance stroll, overtake sainz with 10lap fresher tyre after pit Voted for driver of the day Oh my dear
It sounds like a very boring race
Perez and Alonso drivers of the day ❤
PRETTY SAD FOR YUKI, BORING F1 START NOW. PLEASE LET US ENTERTAIN THE MIDDLE & BOTTOM, WE DONT CARE THE TOP
Kudos to Max and Red Bull. But what happened to these new rules supposed to even the playing field? All were seeing is a pattern of dominance by one team in the 2000's. Ferrari in the early 2000's, then Red Bull, Then Mercedes and again Red Bull. Tons respect for Max but really. It is really no fun to watch when it is same driver winning all the time. F1 needs more parody.
I like to think there's an alternate universe where it rained a lot during this game and George mistook it all for his own swea
Can we have croftys commentary instead please
Most boring season ever!
So Verstappen is furious on himself (as he was against Russel), because he forced Sainz into the (invisible) wall in T1?!
This race is no longer interesting, getting too bored, so much for the red bull and Max Verstappen, it looks like a one way race
No more doubts that Max the phenomenal F1 Driver for long time💪👏👍
The midfield racing was great until penalty for Yuki.Pierre got 1 point alternative Yuki.The decision was based of skin color and country of citizenship.
What the man! Derek Warwick. He and FIA support unfairness even in modern society!
F1の品を下げる愚かな判決だ。 どこかの誰かが言っていたが、素人がやってるのか
Lando 😢
horner : changes your fuckn car🤌🏾  “new sidepot appear” p2 p3 bono : ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
The penalty for Yuki is unfair.
It's funny how Ocon didn't get a penalty for dangerous driving while Yuki got 1 for a perfectly legal move.
very interesting battle!
Miris yaa ferrari sekarang😂
I hate this track men, 8 minutes of DRS overtaking at turn 1
max is a beast
So this is what Yuki got a penalty for !? this is BS !
The only overtaking that ever happens is because of the DRS system. Time to get rid of it and let the drivers race each other for real. No real overtaking in the whole race. F1 has become a farce.
What a boring championship
맥스때문에 F1이 재미없다.
What a Result for Team MERCEDES 🖤👊🏽
Max Verstappen is on a whole different planet of his own
Mercedes is finally stepping up !
There were no highlights
Zzz
Ocon seems like that kid in school that would be fine most of the time, but if someone accidentally hits his face in dodgeball, he’d get super mad and go into psychopath mode.
How is Redbull always in the top. Mercedes needs to hire me & let me bring back the name “German Engineering”
Next race Petronas win H,R
No. P9 for Yuki. Penalty was absolutely ridiculous.
The overtakes made up for last week's cancelled race.. Congratulations to everyone who managed to get to the podium. Congratulations to all the other drivers because trying to get to that podium is more demanding that people think. So far, this is one of my favourite races this season.💚
Btw, see Detroit Indycar GP....
Very disappointed with Ferrari  car...Slow like a turtles..Can't compete with other F1 car
Ocon should be penalized, this was not defending, this wouldn't even be acceptable in Sim Racing games, let alone real life.
So the race only happens on the front straight and maybe a bit in the pits, what a show
So boring
Dont be dumb people! Yeah its a fast car. But you gotta give credits to max. If its only the car then why is checo not dominating. Max became one with the car thats why he is unstoppable
Kinda a boring race
I remember Sainz saying 'I don't care about Lewis'😂😂😂 Know your place Carlos.😂
How does anyone find the DRS "passes" interesting? They aren't it's ridiculous.
Competition is Very Tight "Behind Max"
Fun race, please use Crofty's call. These Commentators are horrible
increible no corren nada estos carros wow nada como los v8 v10 v12 que pena que la formula 1 sea lo que es hoy en dia
Well done Mercedes
Gracias!. Muy buen resumen.
Mercedes ❤️
Tsunoda is P9.
Awful Ferrari now even drops behind Mercedes…
f1 is very pro at turning fans off ....penalty to Tsunoda for what?
This race made me question why tf did they go with the chicane layout in the first place
Practically all the overtakes were on the straight I'm just a casual formula 1 fan but the overtakes couldn't be any more boring seriously > _<
Gotta give credit where its due....especially since the announcer didnt mention it calling the start. Lance stroll had an awesome start and the way he maneuvered between and closed the door to each car he passed on the first corners was admirable.
Ya me esta empesando a aburrir estoo,
me sorprendio checo ..pense que quedaria entre 8 o 9 y sopas termino en 4 lugar excelente carrera
Such a disappointing start for Norris, very unfortunate how fast he lost that p3
Wake the f up Ferrari! You're getting beat by the Black Arrows!
Love this commentator
Did they remove all corners except 1?
I think ferrari they should fired both of their drivers 😢
Lando has zero composure at that position, almost caused a pileup….
How many overtakes are done totally??
who is commentating. I honestly prefer crofty. This person is too high pitched. Has he gone past puberty?
Is anyone mentioning how bad this announcing is? I honestly can't even watch it. F1 go back to what you had.
Sorry this years comentery is making my ears bleed. How is this guy?
el casi tapon de Bocon fue practicamente personal , ojala hubiera taponeado asi la temp pasada a varios, un payaso y peligro al volante pero Alonso lo dejo donde corresponde, mordiendo el polvo y una lastima la falta de rendimiento de AM ojala en Canada se de vuelta la situacion, al parecer los mercedes han despertado.
Formula 1 has a problem when a race consists of Verstappen out to a 30 second lead after a few laps. Nobody has a chance to even get within 25 seconds of him. Its boring and the races are non-competitive unless you support Red Bull.
Glad to see Merc back on track
Boring af   .
Highlights don`t even show verstappen anymore until the race is over 😂
Highlights? Racing? They are driving around 6 seconds slower as their qualifying lap. Since when is that called racing?
great driving max
Race highlights = DRS and turn 1
Ahhh more excitement from the Indy racing today.
Only amateur referees. Overtaking is dangerous. Let's not race anymore. Let's all hold hands and finish together.
Great performances from Hamilton, Russell, Alonso and Perez!!  Ferrari needs to find out what's going on with LeClerc!!  Carlos Sainz, while missing the podium, was the man for Ferrari once again keeping them in the points.  No one acknowledges his performance this year at all.
Stewards hate Tsunoda. BS call.
CROFFTYYYY???
This voice over guy should try decaf before recording.
Perez is useless. Any decent driver would have pulled that RB up to third at least, if not second. I bet Ricciardo would have if he was given the opportunity!  Perez to AT, Ricciardo in  RB seat and Nick to reserve.
I should start betting on this, what a dull, predictable sport.
Bring back crofty to these highlights
Max and his team sounded bored 😂
Excellent race! Since the start of 2022, Max has been doing a stellar job. Keep it that way, Max! Fast and fair driving. Wonderful fights. ❤👍
Max got the best car for sure,but it doesn't mean he is the best driver on the grid
FIA really let their anti Yuki bias show today
o lord ..BACK TO INDY CAR FOR ME man these tilke tracks & ones like it are dull, even the passing seems so computer regimented
The start finish straight highlights... That is all
Ferrari is finished
Does anyone know what happened to Crofty?
That manuever from ocon should be reviewed
This is the first time I have really disliked the commentary.  Horrible.
My heart sunk when Lando and Hamilton touched :( really wanted to see Lando on the podium again - he deserves it
what happened to the normal announcer from last year, Brundle?
Double Arrows is BACK !!!
🏁🏎🏁
Unlucky for lando and yuki
Corrida muito chata sem emoção.
Ferrari is a joke
I honestly don’t know what they can do about Max. He’s just on another level. If you don’t risk it all into turn 1. He’s gonna win
what happened to the other caster?!
Max, hermano ya eres mexicano!!🎉
hola y esa trampa de rossel
Increíble como Max con neumáticos amarillos puede sacar diferencia  hay algo muy importante en ese auto que los demás no tienen y matan el espectáculo
Well done Max!🙂🏎🏁
Why does one guy win all the races?
Where the original commentators at??
Doesn't Ocon deserve a penalty over Tsunoda? The way he defended Alonso's overtake seemed a bit extra
Red Bull is still unbeatable
Lovely! 👍👍
Maximus Prime
hi
i'm afraid FIA would impose a stuck of penalties on Yuki for joining the race ...
Indycar Series >>>>>>>>>>> Formula Red Bull
F1 fans might wanna watch the Indycar Detroit grand prix highlights for more exciting racing.
Worst coverage ever!!😢
How does Max win every race?
formula verstappen
Tornel la bazofia Argentina
F1 is so boring always just 1 team dominating 2020 hamilton max fight was fun to watch but this is an joke
Alonso carrying this season
F1 become boring, Redbul is still over power.
I quit watching the races live because they were boring and only watched these highlights. These are now just as boring. F1 is just a parade at this point when there is consistently an almost 30 second gap between 1st and 2nd.
Fia choose Max to replace MSC record
Toto smiling makes me feel uneasy...
Mmm Mercedes 💚👌
Bring back David Crofty and Martin Brundle
Getting bored with red bull always winning. Same as the Hamilton era
Watch the onboards. It seems like Yuki was braking late into T1 trying to hold the position but as a result of that his car didn't slow down enough for him to take the inside line all the way, and just understeered wide. There's nothing he could have done as braking mid-corner would definetly cause a spin. Not intentioned for Yuki, but as a fact his car pushed Zhou, who was already ahead, off track. If Zhou didn't jink to the left there would definetly be contact. From Zhou's onboard you can see the AT front wing coming directly at him and of course he choose to save the car and his points.  Ocon didn't get a penalty because his move was on the straights(basically no rules for that); back in Australia Sainz got a 5sec that dropped him from P3 to P12 for a simillar move to Yuki's EVEN ON LAP ONE, with icy tires. Thus to me Yuki's penalty was harsh, but understandable.  Nevertheless both Yuki and Zhou put up fantastic races bring there AT and AR tractors to the points. Very well executed for both.
no amount of enthusiasm from the commentators will make F1 as exciting as they make it.  It's very boring.
3 narrações diferentes.. ficou uma merda de entender.
Russell gaining advantage when he cut the corner and no penalty, English privileges
Zak needs to consider a career change
Not realising until now that F1 finally saying ZHOU’s name correctly as ZHOU Guan Yu instead of Guan Yu ZHOU😂
This season is so boring
Russel making a complete illegal movement....but because he has English passport he can do whatever he wants..... Shame!!!
Why in the world HAAS need to get 3 pit stop
What Highlights??? Another Snooze-fest... Was a fan but truth is Indycar is soooo much better actual racing.... TRUTH. In F1 you already know who's winning the championship before the season even starts.... No Drama Whatsoever...
Max tbh made F1 boring...least when Hamilton was reining he just us a show but max he just Start then just finish. No action man we need action to us all on our toes
Yukiのペナルティは納得出来ない！！ Oconの行為こそペナルティでしょ！！
As a Japanese, I’m very disappointed and frustrated FIA
Terribles narradores cambien los ya!
Max so bored 😂😂😂 he sounds sleepy, he had to go over the track limit to make it interesting for himself
Admin, pls show us how russell made those places at the start
Russell passing 5 cars out of track, no penalty. Yuki defending hard, 5 second penalty. The BS from the stewards sometimes 🤦
Merc has taken a big step! 👏
yuki😭😭
honestly the only thing keeping me from watching is alonso and the mid fielders
Yuki Penalty is totally joke
Ferrari is there only as a representative,the red on the track,it seems as the team has no get up and go,something is up,it’s not normal,politics,money? Who knows but it’s not realistic,we shall see once red bull wraps up the season,what will happen with the races left!
Zhou : He push me off man !! Yuki : ?? His car says kick man !
Mercedes making moves!! 👏🏽👏🏽
Another snoozefest
Russell should be penalised for an illegal overtake on Piastri (but tbf, he’d overtake him anyways), Yuki shouldn’t have gotten a penalty for something others do yet he didn’t even push him off since there was space (example: Hamilton Maldonado 2012 Valencia, Verstappen Hamilton 2021 Imola, Verstappen Hamilton Bahrain 2018, Rosberg Alonso Bahrain 2012)(In fact with 2012 Valencia, it was Hamilton who pushed Maldonado off yet Maldonado got a penalty for bad rejoining
So... Grand Chelem?
Verstappen doing Verstappen things
WHERE IS CROFTY??!!?
This race was so boring. Its half a day later and I already forgot it happened
Yuki was robbed. This poor japanese driver has stolen his precious points by FIA' inconsistent penalties
formula 1 please bring the commentary from Skysport
Verstapen the best driver today for all those who cry and invent lies Verstapen el mejor piloto de la actualidad para todos los que lloran e inventan mentiras
If you want to penalize yuki for such an incident, take verstappen's 2022 championship trophy away from him first
Will Max ever overtake Hamilton for most wins?
Chinaman like complaint. Poor Yuki. That's why don't like China. Please remove Shanghai circuit from F1 calendar. 😊
I think Ferrari is a mid tier team now
where is the other announcer doesn't even feel like f1 hightlights with this guy
This is for me one of the most boring championships in a long time
I think there is a alternative universe of this race where Carlos spun around verstappen on the first lap and he dropped down to last place and he raged like a baby.
Another dominant performance from red bull and max verstappen.
Le négrophobe.
Looks like Perez got hit game back: great comeback from out of the points to right into the scrap of it!
Congrats to Mercedes.They have a powerful car today!
SuperๆๆMAX
Ok pero F1 poniendo la narración en español?
I would have loved seeing how things went with Verstappen starting second.
If you think life’s hard try being a Manchester United and Ferrari fan 🥲🥲
3730 comments -- Mercedes : Two years lost. THIS race is a true lesson : never again believe all other technicians are silly. Be humble, accept you made a big mistake ... Right now you are 2 seconds from RB ...not engineer but your frontal air intake should be enlarged for improvement together with the floor to be back with a winning car, take o leave this advice. I want see Hamilton winning 8-9-10 championships.
So much overtake and not for once to lead..max will win everything ths season like this
Russel es una calamidad
Malah sumory
Mercedes is back YESSSSSSSS
Feel bad for norris...ferrari what r they doing again lol😂... congratulations george and lewis ❤
Redbool debería de tener un solo piloto y listo se acabó el peo
so boring. worst is watching zhou/tsunoda/anywho fighjting for nothing.
Max ....
Gracias por el resumen, ahora me queda claro que sigue siendo aburrida la F1 y no vale la pena verla.
Detroit GP was better.
Imagine if Hamilton wins 🤔
if you give 5sec penalty for Yuki,then what you should give ocon for that horrible defending?
Jarak waktu antar Pembalap  kurang competitive ( jaraknya terlalu jauh ), balapan menjadi kurang seru, red bull terlalu dominan
am i the only one who got bored with F1? Verstappen would be Hamilton 2.0 where he would dominate for the next 5-7 years if FIA not doing something.
Why merc didn't ditch their sidepods earlier this season!
A1GP
feel bad for lando norris
Horner was right "change your fu*king car!!!"😂😂😂😂
I miss sky sports commentary. 😢
I don't know about Yuki's penalty. If we're handing out penalties for that Lance Stroll wouldn't bother getting into the car.
I would love to see Ferrari win again!
Kasihan max cuma kesorot kamera di awal dan akhir vidio 😂
Where is Ferrari ?
Imagine Yuki in a top car, would be pretty cool
That sidepods paid off for mers
Muy basado Verstapen
Yuki got robbed
can we get the normal stream back for the highlights? can't stand these commentators
Verstappen 3 in a row. Red Bull isn’t playing this year. Go Red Bull.
hey
Very beautiful Grand Prix again Hamilton is still my favourite even if he didn’t do well in the last weeks and Mercedes drop down a little
Congratulations to All
From an outsider perspective watching this montage, you might think that this circuit only has three turns and then the pit lane, lol.
Ferrari gave us false hope again.
Aston martins looked a bit slow..
Race started at a decent US hour yet I still fall asleep.
Bravo Carlo Sainz ,tu e Leclerc avete sotto al culo un motore FERRARI...Dovete farlo urlare il migliore suono del mondo❤
5:18 just look at alonso on ocon with drs:)
Verstappen wins again, how boring this sport is 💤
Another snooze fest resuult for the top of the podium
And Mclaren show their capabilities in grasping defeat from the jaws of a top 10 finish, Sack Zack
Next :  1. ALONSO  2. STROLL  3. OCON  4. GASLY  5. LECLERC  6. BOTTAS  7. NORRIS  8. TSUNODA  9. PIASTRI  10. DE VRIES
Sick of seein max winning.
角田の件は どう見てもおかしい 角田贔屓じゃ無くても この裁定は間違っている。
f1 is a borefest seems like the drivers don't even defend no more
Why did Red Bull pit Perez so close to the finish? he was cutting through the field and they called him into the pits?? They threw away a podium.
nobody can Beat Redbull and Max....
En nombre del publico Hispanohablante gracias por incorporar audio en español, ya hacia falta.
24 segundos em cima do Hamilton kkkk
This season is so boring as F just max win straight so freaking boring
even this summary was boring
Amazing how much the commentators biggeged up the overtaking.  Boooooring, just gonna started ragging my 2.0 😂
Why are there new commenters?
Even redbull are bored of this 😂
Can we hv crofty’s voice back
Let go mer et LH et gr❤❤
Man, F1 need better stewards ASAP. We can't support a championship so insconstant and bad decisions. They can fight? They can't? This race is ok, that is not? This pilot can do it, that one can't?
Alpha Romeo puo far meglio!. Forza!
Categoría aburrida!! Hace más de treinta años sabes quién ganará la carrera, no hay sorpresas etc . Siempre son dos o un equipo el que gana ? Esto apesta !! El indycar es más entretenido y competitivo
Congratulations to George Russell.  Everyone was on track at the same time, and he didn't even  hit anyone.
Why dint Russel get a penalty ?
Ferrari from being contenders in the 1st stages last year to 4th this season.  Nothing has improved or changed. The only change is the Team Principal and nothing more. ☹️
I hope Aston haven’t hit a wall with performance
F1 didn't put a penalty to max, he block sainz in the start, and Russell didn't had penalty too, this F1 year it's really disgusting how the judges give advantage to somos...ridiculous competition.
F1 is really boring, they should consider reverse grid or something to shake things up
Soy fan de checo, le falta constancia para ser el uno de equipo grande.
Russell :-D yop
cars were overtaking each other all the time on the longest straight on the track.  the richest teams always win.  f1 is very boring...😅
Didn’t know catalunya had one turn 😂
No closed captioning
Barcelona Capital 21
Spain 🇪🇸
Viva la Scuderia Lumache😂
LETS GO MERCS 🎉🎉
borrrinnnnnggggggggg    .fia do somethingggggggg ,this is boringgggggg
What's wrong with he's Voice bring back the F1 voice my goodness this one is really bad
6:11 he cut the chicken 😅
Best porformance by rb car and another boring race by mv 😝
The Dutch are very calm because of the many mistakes of the Mexicans.
I'm a big f1 fan but this track should be completely redesigned nothing happens it's a really boring race
the most boring spanish grand prix. Bring back the chicane
Im a big fan of Max but i am glad to see that Mercedes has made improvements after the bad decisions made.
LEWIS ON THE PODIUM THE WORLD IS HEALING
Shouldnt have penalty for Yuki
RB are a level ahead in every single department
Why did they pit Perez on Lap 50? Haven’t watch it live. Was it a bad strat or was his wheel almost flat?
What would be that circuit without the turn 1 and the DRS ?
who is the ferrari race strategist..really bad strategy in a row..pity him
Boooooooorrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiinnnnnnngggggg!  This race was even more boring than the last one!
What are Ferrari doing
That's NOT Crofty and Brundle >:(
There was something about this video and the commentator that despite all the overtakes it sounded boring
Boring boring F1 🥱
Boring boring boring !!!!!!!!!
Como siempre. Barcelona aburridïsimo🙄🤬
Verstappen ganando por una distancia obscena. No importa cuando o en qué circuito. 🥱🥱🥱
F1 never fails to conpletely waste 3 hours of my weekend
George was my driver of the day
Spain, but the S is very silent
Legend Max
Best moments: 8:03
Max Verstappen First Place For Red Bull Racing Honda. Second Place Lewis Hamilton For Mercedes. And Third Place George Russell  For Mercedes.
How come when Hamilton had an even more dominant car he could not be as dominant as max??? Oh wait its because Hamilton is just average. F1 is for nobodys....
People out here defending Yuki for forcing Zhou off the track while in the same breath attacking George for being forced off the track are deadass clowns XD
First we had the Red Bull, then the Green Bull, now the Black Bull. Probably a budget cap issue coming just like the other 2 Bulls lol.
Even redbull sounds bored about winning everything
Lol FIA Penalty Yuki Tsunoda.... Chinesse Money....🎉🎉🎉🎉
Tsunoda didn't deserve the 5 Sec Penalty
Ganó el más chingon .
Aston needs more upgrades stat, cant let Merc catch up!!
This race was like watching f1 manager gameplay 💀
Formula One Race Action in Barcelona Circuit de Catalunya in 🇪🇸.
Bosen yg menang itu terus
where is david croft????
I cant believe im saying this but im happy to see merc bouncing up
1. Newey should be banned from F1. He is genius. 2. Dunno why, but this is first season, where I want sleep while watching F1. 3. Bring back ONE-SHOT QUALYFYING.
No sé. Verstappen ganando tantas carreras consecutivas, está taaan raro.Umm!!!
Red bull win…. Boring
Really proud of Zhou to keep pushing
Dang, I'm afraid AM now will relegated to 3rd or even 4th in the standings. Merc upgrade right now seems to be working well.
Its crazy i predictied mercedes. 😂
A overreacted Chinese? Wow, it’s also common on the Internet
Pity Yuki got a penalty, but it also is quite obvious that Zhou clearly grip to continue turn in and remain at least a half car width on track, while Yuki (intentional or not) didn’t turn his wheel more to give room to Zhou, nor able to pull away like Max, or yield. Yuki should just give the position back… and sadly, because regulation change in 2021, Stewards can’t just ask teams to do that anymore, so they gave the lightest they can hand out… If it’s in the past, this can also get ruled as a racing incident, but the regulation on when to give room is more clear (to promote passing cars after a DRS zone).
Feel bad for Norris, did everything he needed to do yesterday and lost it on lap 1
Red Bull Team Out Of Rules FIA 2023
🥱😴
This race was boring.
オコンの幅寄せの方が、角田よりよほど危険だ。裁定は平等でない。
Hamilton 🎉🎉🎉
Tal parce que Max Verstappen va a ganar casi todas las carreras de esta temporada 💀
👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍💙💙💙💙💙
This video should be about 10 seconds long, because there were zero “highlights.” What a dreadfully boring race. NASCAR is probably more exciting now.
What happened to Crofty in highlights?
Finally , duo Mercedes were on the podium
This commentary ain’t it. Crofty much better
Max must be getting bored of being so far ahead every race
Never thought id see 2 boats on the front row.
Shame for Lando
There are highlights?
Mercedes is biting at the heals..  Luck is finicky. Max has the machine but does he have the ongoing assistance of the gods. Like Michael during his run, I suspect he does.
F1 getting more boring and boring
What a turgid incoherent decision for Yuk!  Warwick, was that you again?
Boring race
Boring race
Take away DRS and turn 1 and then you truly see how much trouble F1 is in these days. All the time, effort and money to change the regulations to make for more exciting races and this is where it got us.
RB will win all races of the season
Chuck Norris et Kurt Russel
Stroll challenge verstappen 🍻
NO ONE WHO CAN'T STOP THE DUTCH RED BULL 😁😁😁😁
Go Benz!
ユウキに対してのペナルティがよくわかりません。 衝突したわけでも無くスローで見てもどう見ても周がバランスを崩しただけのように見える
I preffer David croft
The most boring race in quite a while.
The lovely driver took the lovely car to another lovely win in this lovely campaign. Lovely
That's not Yuki fault bro
What a drive for Russell!
Here comes the Killer whales, YES!
角田の何も悪くないやん😂
As a Sainz fan that was painful to watch
Mercedes this race 🔥🔥
Si
Awesome the Killer whales are finally nipping at the Bull's hovees!
FIAのスチュワードには素人しかおらんのか？
I think it's time to get rid of DRS and replace it with something where the defending driver actually stands a chance!
Boring
This commentator is everything I hate about 90’s radio jockies. Fake disingenuous excitement. I now turn down the sound when watching the replays.
I’m not a Merc fan, but at this rate, they will have a shot at RedBull next year. This might get spicy (next year).
Undicesimo Leclerc  ,le Alfa trattate come pezza di terra, Ma siete sicuri che i Marchi italiani stiano bene  nelle mani di questa Famiglia? Stanno trattando il prestigio ed la storia come quelle schifose macchine che costruiscono  fiat . Ma scherziamo? Quando è troppo è troppo BASTA!!
Where is David Croft?😭
When the same driver wins every race, formula one becomes boring. Less and less people are watching formula one these days.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Damm felt bad for norris, honestly if he hadn't gotten the front wing damage in the beginning he would've ended up in the points, if not on the podium
😴
No sense punishment! U guys are killing any chance to have a real race
From P2 to P5, Ferrari is not okay 😔
Honestly i was shocked with that decision in TSU and ZHO incident
Zhou bottled it and ran out of road. Worst penalty application so far this season. Disgraceful. Yuki simply defended his position, its called racing.
I fell asleep for most of the race, what did I miss? Oh yeah, nothing
I think we're in to see one of the most dominant performances of all time by a driver throughout a season. Max is just driving to perfection. If things continue like this, it seems Max will win every race except for the 2 Perez already won.
I am relatively new to F1, may someone explain to me the logistics of Yuki’s penalty?
I love watching 8 minutes of Turn 1......this race was honestly disappointing
Why haven't they given Max his third title yet? It's June already... hurry up F1!
Someone just give max the title now.. so we can finish another boring year of F1
GRAND PRIX OF SPAIN 2023, ONE OF THE MOST BORING RACES IN HISTORY. WHAT A FAIL. YOU SHOULD RETURN THE MONEY TO ALL THOSE BRAVES WHO KNOWING WHAT WAS COMING DECIDED TO ATTEND TO THAT BOREDOM. WHAT A SHAME!!!
This race was so boring. The race was over after the first lap.
It is just me or was this race super confusing? Like why did it look like everyone pit like 4 times
" Mercedes update working well"  finishing 24 seconds behind max......
Eminem go round the outside
What dou you guys think, will Leclerc stay with Ferrari if they continue to ruin his carrier ?
Before I press play, I'm going to predict Max won by a mile. As usual. Because it's too predictable to waste my life watching live. Let's see... Skip thru it in 40 seconds...ah yes. Same result as last time. And the last. And the last. Yet another easy-to-predict-on-Thursday borefest. Watched the IndyCar instead for some proper racing...
Boring
No crash race 👍🏻👍🏻
Ocon getting cheeky with Alonso...  Still bad blood between them.
F1 has become a snooze fest
Tsunoda left so much space, confusing penalty.
Video should be renamed "Turn 1 highlights"
0:55 Lewis backed out b/c he discovered he needed to protect the inside too late and chopped Norris.
👍
In My Life, I Want Verstappen Losing, Not Winning Because He's Greedy And Nightmarish.
Oh the yelling…
Est-ce la course à laquelle Kylian Mbappé a assisté aujourd'hui ?
Where’s crofty’s voice? This makes no sense why would they punish us for missing the race even more with this dub 😂
Hamilton and his daft helmet lol
Como hincha d Ferrari sentí más pena x Norris q x la vergüenza q paso Leclerc este finde
I wonder what the rest of the track looks like.
Poor lando…
strange driver of the day result. What exactly did Hamilton do that was so spectacular?
Narrador ruim.
maFIA again. Well they can simply can give Zhou's place again instead of giving a 5-Second Penalty.  Yuki is doing well in that AlphaTauri before the maFIA ruined his race.
boring af
Boring F1 already with this guy always winning
Zzz
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT MAX!
Could RB sound any less enthused about "another win". Yawn.
Yuki didnt deserve that penalty
Estão muito lentos os carros há uns anos atrás na maior reta em Barcelona os carros iam aos 365 370 agora chega aos 330 e não é fácil é só obrigado
shut up max
MERCEDES!!!!!!!!
Una mas de alonso vs Hamilton 🔥😎
Toto je fake jak hovado
HAMILTON STILL GOT AWAY WITH RUINING ANOTHER s CAR AND RACE AGAIN.....TYPICAL F I A 7:48 THATS A BEAUTIFUL SITE THO
Surprised Aston Martin didn't give teams orders for Lance to give a position to Fernando.  He was only a split second behind.  I don't think they expect much from Lance for the season and with Fernando relatively close in the standings...
Let Max enjoy the car while it lasts
Man so boring again... 5 more years red bull wins.
Where is crofty?
Another snoozefest for the collection
The hypocrisy in this comment section. Everyone is saying that max is a great driver and that's why he wins but when lewis won it was the car
Pas capable les commentateurs Français!👎
Penalty for Yuki but when Crashstaphen does that and even bumps the other cars out of the way it's completely legal. F1 is a joke the last 6 years.
End Racism??????????????
What an awful commentary
Quelle mauvaise narration. Les commentaires des animateurs sont tellement ternes. De bonnes parties de la course est non commentée. Quel dommage !
What happened to Martin and david as commentators? Is this shmee?
Now im not ashame to park my old Honda Civic alongside with Ferrari
Will red bull ever stop winning I have a feeling that max is winning this season
I thought it was completley fine to force others off track in F1!
The the first lap  Then then the last. All that has mattered all year...
Just lovely Max!
Russel had me laughing man 😂😂😂
What a talent max is simply wonderful and lovely and great job from Mercedes great race 🙌
So proud of the work Mercedes has done to the car...
Kudos to Lance Stroll who was the only driver able to overtake elsewhere then in first corner; nonetheless the 7-time world champion.
Why do you post the race highlights in French ? I do not appreciate that! There is a part of video that doesn’t have song? I’m really angry with you. Since the start of season I see the highlights in French it’s disappointing. I unsubscribe from your channel because is enough
Yes mercedes wooohooo
Great performance by mercedes though. Wasnt expecting it 😅
Max put 2 - F up at the worst stewards in F1 (Spanish GP) - got the fastest lap regardless of your bad judgment, those stewards do not wish drivers to race, would turn F1 into a boring sport - F  them.
I sort of tuned out Ferraris quick collapse early in the season (again) and just realized they're 6th and 7th in the drivers championship. Ouch.
Go back to the ESPN announcer
S.perez geriden gelip yarisin ortasindan H lastiğe gectikden sonra her tur 2 saniye yaklaşıp 4 bitirdi...❤
MERCEDES ARE BACK!
Prancing horse 🐎 again missing in action 😮
Russel was lucky this time. Hope he has a puncture next time
F1 is over this is a managed show
Tsunoda's move that drew a penalty wouldn't have made Lewis' Top 10.
I want Crofty and smaller car
Formula 1 is so boring nowadays! One horse race.
Great to see F1 back.  Best nap I've had in weeks!
Last time I checked this was a race, you know like the kind where you race for positions to prove you are the better athlete… I guess defending your position isn’t a thing in formula 1! Soft, so very soft the sport is becoming that you cannot take track space to force another driver to use his brakes. In my opinion that’s racing, he couldn’t seal the deal so here comes the FIA to give it to him cause another driver made him use his brakes. If anyone wants to watch real racing go watch a motocross or supercross race, that would be like someone coming up the inside of a corner to make a block pass, the other rider checking up to let the pass happen (or risk fighting it and having his front tire taken out) and then the AMA giving a penalty because the rider made a block pass that “could have” caused another rider to fall over. Come on that would never happen. We’re talking about racing, is this just a parade?
Zhou have done this race n decent!🤩
Boring
Nice turn 1 race . ZzzzZzZz
A llorar y a domicilio. Max gana con 3 ruedas  al viejito  ja ja ja
That was not a penalty to Tsunoda, Zhou turned his steering wheel to the side.
los mecánico de  la Ferrari son una basura
Gold
Gold
In French 😍🤩
We are still hearing LH44 cry like a b*t*h😅😂
Why is nobody talking about how bad these commentators are?
I'm sorry, but this kind of gap between cars doesn't appeal me enough. F1 is boring now. Save it please. TF is every race now? Redbull racing against itself
Yuki got a penalty for that? Come on, the fia let worse things slide...
The lake of fire is for eternity
Biggest surprise was not seeing Alonso Perez and Verstappen podium😅
For me Penalty for Tsunoda is 100% deserved, close the dor to early put Zhou outside , no space room !
Even max was getting bored 💀💀
GO LH
Hamilton 2nd nice only 24 seconds behind.
They fix the car now that Ferrari wants Lewis. 😏
Ha Ha Ha Hamilton didn't win. Well done Max.
Another boring race proudly brought to you by F1.
🧢
Russell did everything the rule book said, go around the bollard so what’s every mad about
Would you say Perez is underperforming with that red bull car?
Whoever kept persisting with the Zero side-pod concept at Merc should be made design Lada's for eternity
GIVE YUKI HIS 2 POINTS
Are you still watching this theatre? Ridiculous
How is that a five second time penalty?
From an era of OP Mercedes to an era of an OP RedBull. I was hoping for closer battles in the front.
Sorry but F1 is boring last decade
🎉😅😂
Super Max
F1 is boring without croft and brundle
We have gone from merc winning every race to red bull winning every race it's so boring
T1 sure looks cool. Wonder what the rest of the track looks like...
So booring but how did yuki get 5sec? Like when does fia knows what to do
Bormula 1 continues...zzzzz More man, less machine please
It’s not fun to watch the race when you know the results. As a fan I wanna see other drivers and teams fighting for the championship.
F1 is getting boring tbh, the outcome is always the same, redbull dominating and verstappen 1st place in almost every race. They should make all cars the same, if that happens f1 will be exciting again. If all cars are almost the same, it will just come down to who is the most talented behind the wheel.
And people said Monaco was boring..
Congratulations max , you’re generation is hard to bit 🤝🤝🤝
Just give Super Max the 2023 title this year. Man's been phenomenal all season and there's no way anyone can stop him.
and AGAIN russel: no further action. that guy must have fia shares or something
Well freakin done Mercedes!!!👏🏾
No sé porque no le pidieron a Russell regresar la posición a Piastri, es claro que ganó espacio al salirse de la pista.
You guys are destroying the channel with the 300 uploads a day. The YouTube algo doesn't like it.
What a disappointment from Ferrari...
Aston Martin now need the same upgrade as Mercedes....
Ocon is a total tool
Decepción de Checo 😢
yukis penalty was BS!!!!!!
Max had another great weekend.  Like how he got the B/W Flag and then set a fastest lap...🤯 👍
So it’s safe to say it’s Max and then everyone else all year long
Another boring F1 race.
Max is just on a different level 👌
Max is unbelievably consistent.
Feel sad for Lando😢
Hamilton is just not that guy anymore. He will always be in Verstappens rear view mirror
You know the season is bad when even your favorite winning team also makes you bored
Just a lovely race
It's obvious the cars are equal!! Boring Boring
Me desconcentra el narrador, se siente como si estuviera viendo fútbol   I can't concentrate with the narration I feel like I'm watching football other unofficial channels narrate it better 😅
Boring, time make all the cars the same so we can see who the best driver actually is.
Hamilton should have a sponsorship with Tempo. All his fans keep crying. You guys need a lot of tissues
Que Ganas de llorar con este equipo de Taxis piratas Ferrary en la calle con ese par de tuercas 😅😢😢😢😢😢😢carrera aburrida
Overtakes only with DRS. Same emotion when I pass a car on the highway. C’mon… very boring race
Forget Verstappen everyone else is putting on a show but he is ruining it
Terserah tuhan gantiin sakit orang berduit dan orang bermujizat. Takdir d1 tidak bisa d3. Makan dicari hewan dari gantiin sakit dari eman
Man am happy to see Mercedes on podium again
I read the comments after every race, wondering why does no one mention Ferrari, how bad is their car this season. It is hard to be a Ferrari fan.
Grande Honda!
Max is on another planet this season
It's a bit sad that winning is becoming more and more routine to Max and RB, since it starts to take the emotion out of the event of winning. Just winner's syndrome, but it's the same thing everybody used to hate Merc for.
where's the highlights in portuguese?
Can we please get better commentators!
Poor Lando :(
Where are Crofti and Brundle on the 🎤?
The fact that someone can be penalized as Tsunoda ha been, its a tragedy for this sport.
I have no idea what happened in the race. You've just created 8min of turn 1 replays.
With all those overtakes and wheel to wheel everyone finished
Russell gained one position in the runoff at the start — don't tell me that wasn't planned
You've done well to get 8 minutes of highlights out of that
Sdh ferrari kibarkan bendera putih ..... , ferrari sdh gk ada apa apanya .... , bubarkan ferrari ....muak gue lihatnya ...
Albon at the back where he belongs!
its frightening how fast max's car is. when your setting the fastest lap in qualifying and then just keep beating your own time and nobody else is close it becomes abit pointless to a casual like me watching the races, i loved seeing max and lewis neck and neck and max pipping him on the final race of the season to win the championship, but it seems totally boring to me now, im not a huge F1 fan but i loved watching races when it was competitive, reality is unless max crashes or has failures in his engine he'll win basically every race of the season. hopefully lewis or alonso can start taking some 1st places and even the sesson out because its so boring to watch when its a 1 horse race all the time.
WHAT WAS THAT PENALTY ON TSUNODA???
La fomula.aburrida, no me explico si es q así de aburrida es la vida de las personas q asisten a esto es competencia de marcas y no de pilotos y es siempre un monólogo q cosa con esa mentira.
Mercedes did really well
Seeing Norris tumbling from P3 all the way down P17 is just tragic but somehow hilarious at the same time.
Whats about the two cars on the right at the start? did they started later some how?
It’s getting boring.
Redbull makes this not even fun too watch anymore lol hasn’t been a competitive race for 1st in awhile without max having a car issue
Unfortunately, another boring race.  One winner all the time = turn off the TV time.
Fia bull estourou tanto o teto orçamentário q tem carro de sobra kkk e fora o 1 titulo passado a mão
WALTTERI.......where r you?
As usual, the Ferraris were no where. Every new setup sends them always to mid pack. When will they ever be winners.
How come this victory is not Grand Slam   He took pole position, took fastest lap, led every lap aur won the race  Still why it's not Grand Slam ?  Can anybody explain me this???
Vous aussi,vous avez le commentateurs belge ?
one of these days max is gonna get bored from dominating f1 so much
That call on yuki was so dumb
F1 has gotten so stale. find myself struggling even to watch the highlights 🥱
Greta job Zhou🎉 If Zhou did not avoid Yuki’s car, both two would crash. There has to be penalty but I think given position back to Zhou would be more appropriate
It's become like a video game for verstappen
I have no idea why Ocon always has tense battles with Fernando. I don't get the focus on Yuki; I think this year he's more mature and he deserves another year in F1 and a better car. Finally, if Mercedes keeps this up, I doubt Lewis is switching to Ferrari; I mean Ferrari is just not serious at all. It would be 100% beginning from nothing for Lewis whereas he remains positive and grateful in his current team and that's shown on the radios after each race. As for Lance, having Ferando as a team mate turns out to be a blessing; eventually he'll mature as a driver.
This is 1-way traffic like Haaland was the Premier League.
why penalty for tsunoda and not for ocon?
Decent race 3 stars
Whenever Checo leaves RB, I hope George Russel takes his spot. That boy has it in him to become a champion, and be a serious challenge to Max.
Merc is back 🎉❤
NO Yuki...Only Max can push others off, u cant!
Yuki's penalty is a joke
This isn’t even racing anymore. Boring beyond belief.
Ferrari sabotaged Leclerc's race yet again. Who starts in the pits on hards just to pit early for softs and pit late for hards again?
Idk why but whenever Verstappen says "that was a lovely race" it makes me so annoyed. Seems hella arrogant and condescending
Yuki should consider the bigger picture instead of just driving, especially in the late game. Older medium tires vs. Zhou's fresher hard tires. Give up the position and grab the valuable P10.
Bruv why is man stuck to 360p tf
Tsunoda penalty is a joke
categoria ridicula não a copetitividade
I miss Croft's commentary
How can Tsunoda get a penalty but Verstappen for the same action does not?
Ferrari are a joke.
Again Verstappen runs the Ferrari off the road at turn 1 race start and gets away with it again. F1 stewards are a joke
f1 is unwatchable at this point. Can’t race wheel to wheel.. unbelievable.
I wish there would be an app where you can select your driver and have access to the cockpit view and selected team conversations. You could then watch the whole race from the pov of your favorite driver. I'd pay for that.
this season is so boring
Lewis is still him
And we are back to the 1 driver is miles above the rest boring races era, just like what happened with Vettel and Hamilton. Yippee
alonso offering to finish behind stroll is the best sportsmanship ive seen this season
I enjoyed this race
Boring even the short  highlight
Eso es ya sospechoso siempre verstapen las mejoras son para el y Pérez sin mejoras y en lo posible que abandone las carreras o que quede fuera de los podios, se ve la mafia de red bull
W14 🚀
Yuki was hard done by. Great racing from him
i think even redbull are getting bored of max winning lol
That escape route was terrible. Russell gaining several positions by not staying in the track. That was a decisive move.
Litteraly 8 min of overtakes with DRS at the end of the main straight, what a show!
Question, why do we have different announcers from the normal SkyF1 crew on these highlight packs?
Lets go mercedes
Rassel
How did Russel did not get a penalization?
Don't normally watch these vids but missed the start. Nice to hear the Channel 4 comms instead of Crofty.
Un saludo
how come the announcer no longer say lights out and away we go
Can we get the other casters back for the highlights please?
While I'm all for tge Alonso comeback, this and the last season are simply boring. Sure there's a lot of action on the backfield, it's just boring. I mostly watch it through these highlights. 😅
FIA so inconsistent, literally on lap 1 Verstappen did to Sainz what Tsunoda did to Zhou and recieved nothing?
1:52 2:11 2:21 6:16
We want David crofty's commentary ❤️🔥🥺
Lewis looks so happy up there on the podium
As a Ferrari Fan, amazing job from mercedes, they deserve to be there
The overtake lap 51, Alonso on Ocon, simply breathtaking. Fernando Alonso was always one of the most exciting drivers in F1, brave with outstanding reflexes.
As a Ferrari fan...i regret watching F1 again...after 5 years 🦧
Oh, did Verstappen cheat again? no surprise there, then.
B O R I N G ! ! !
Diganle a Checo que la carrera termino....
🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱👍🏼
All cars finished, long time don't see it (at least i dont remember)
Zhou keep going ♡
Proof that drs overtakes are not exciting. I did not like this track before, and I do not like it now. Only rain would have saved this from being quite dull
After the start, we hardly ever see Max anymore.
Que bueno por Mercedes. Me encanta que ya encuentran el camino de la competitividad
Is this the highlights or "T1 overtaking compilation"?
Vestappen AYRTON SENNA 41 WINS!
Tsunoda clearly didn't deserve that Penalty. Really felt for him today.
Guys, Shakira appeared here, I missed to watch Spain GP, becouse I am a NASCAR fan
Max sounds bored of winning
Max radio at the end.... Even he's bored  of winning
Shame on you, Carlos! During the race start, you had the golden opportunity to overtake Max at T1 but you quickly throw it away! Now he's one win away from Ayrton Senna!
Idk if removing that final chicane made things even better for this track
Max is spraying a lot of champagne these days
"and this really is the spanish gp I promise and we're really seeing this much overtaking"  had me rolling
Please change system all race is bored ...
Always love seeing McLaren out of the points
Is no one talking bout Perez ?! 🤨
66 laps of snooze fest
Hamilton o lacrador atrás de Verstappen,  como deve ser.
Ferrari is a fake
Ocon manh...such an *****le...as always
Benz is back!
That penalty was harsh, should have been a “give the position back” in my opinion.
I protest this discrimination as a Japanese.
boring like schumacher and hamilton. see you next year
How they managed to get 8 minutes of highlights out of this race I will never know...
Super Max ❤
Where is crofty?
dont know how you made an 8 minutes highlights with this
🏁🏁🏁
I really hate OCON tbf, he’s just like a kid from the neighbours who’s just so desperate and jealous of what he doesn’t have, so selfish and doing stuff over the line because he constantly wants to PROVE he’s better than his teammate
We want Turkish Grand Prix 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
How can you beat Max vesrstapen ?! That should be teaching in school nowadays
Excellent drive Lewis, I am still not a fan, but excellent drive my brother
Wheres is Crofty?
Where is crofty
I must say this. This was by far the most boring race of the year
What happened to crofty?
You didn’t deserve that penalty. Harsh from the FIA
tsunoda: is on his racing line, doesn't even touch zhou fia: 5 segundos penalidad for tsunoda  ocon: literally pulls a schumacher - barrichello hungary 2010 on alonso fia: I see no problem with that
I feel fuuny. I should be happy with two British drivers on the podium but I'm caught up in the Alonso hype train this year.
😢😢😢ferrari
Ferrari has upgrades
the most unnecessary penalty i have seen, poor Yuki  5:51
Happy to see Merc is putting a fight. Kinda wish any of the Spanish drivers took the podium, i expected lots from Alonso and Sainz.
Ha even the commentators know this is normally a bore fest 😂
Really boring to see F1 this last years, RedBull is gonna win the next 4-5 championships for sure
Max keeps it on the track, and it's another 'lovely' boring win. Man I hope Honda are working  overtime on that new engine to bring some competition back to F1.
Excellent from the Mercs, they put yesterday behind them and got on with it. The cars looking much better, let’s hope better days are ahead for the team.
It's just disgusting, how Alonso has to sit behind the team owner's son. And the fact that Stroll senior lets it happen that way is also just downright disgusting.
So this new generation of cars sux. I do like Red Bull but I would really like to see somebody else have a chance of winning.
Mais que devient la F1 ? Verstappen à pros le contrôle
Ferarri is bigest destroyed of career
So, Max is now greater than Alonso .. Next is Sebs' record
Wake up Alonso! fight is not finished!!
Clips of some other race at 3:05?
El comentarista sureño no vió la rateria de Russell??? Deplorable 👎👎👎
Bring back Martin Brundle and Crofty. That was Yuki's corner. Max winning by 23 seconds is just mental.
Max actually sounded a bit bored at the end, I bet he is hoping for some more fights with the Mercs in future races with their upgrades, he is a true racer at the end of day.
Cant believe George's helmet rain didnt make the highlights. It was hilarious
Es gran Chelin para Max?
The dread man made a late appearance!❤😂
Another rigged outcome thanks to the FIA: No penalty for Russel, a penalty out of the blue for Yuki and no penalty for Ocon's move against Fernando
Cadê a narração em português? 🇧🇷
Wow Formula 1 Verstappen....Hamilton anytime the same sooooo Boring ☹️🥱🥱🥱😫
I'm shocked they found 8 minutes worth of highlights for this race...
Great job! silver arrows.
There’s no purpose watching f1 cause we know how each race ends. Verstappen wins
hamilton is back he looks happy
Verstappen was 2sec ahead of Sainz in the first two laps.... insane
Falta ao Sainz o que sobra ao Max, coragem.
They need to just give verstappen the championship since he wins every week. This has become pretty boring knowing who the winner will be.
Phenomenal driving from Perez.
Firstappen
What happen to Hamilton?
Another boring winning Verstapen race
Max Firstappen 💪💥💥
Completely boring race
AND ITS LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO AS MAX VERSTAPPEN TAKES HOME ANOTHER VICTORY
Honestly, watching this, Max just winning every race.. vs watching the Isle of Man TT. It’s not even a comparison. Racing is 10x better even in formula 3.
bro whats up with the FIA?
Abbiamo un pilota bidone che si chiama sainz
no smiling till Charles wins a race again
What happens to the trademark “it's lights out and away we go”
at the beginning of the season i was hesitant about these casters we get on youtube highlights after years of listening just to Martin and crofty but after 7 races i must admit i was far off this is not bad its awful. thanks Sky sports for not letting us have the actual commentators
Incrível...O entusiasmo do comentador é contagiante tornando tudo mais entusiasmente! O piloto favorito Hamilton ficou em segundo lugar! No próximo grande prémio F1 fique... em primeiro lugar?!
They sure know how to do everything they can to make this sport so boring the most exciting thing was when verstappen exceeded track limits almost fell out of my chair fans pray for rain these days 🙏 😅
Max is different gravy
To sum this up. Ferrari is the worst team out there. All teams have shown improvements, but they go backwards. After years (50 years) of support I have to drop them. Looks like they have to drop teamboss and all. Le Clerc and Sainz will do better in any other team, no feature where they are  with
I wonder if Max will win just as many World Championships as Hamilton and Schumacher, if not more?
Boring. Cheating Max and Red Bull.
The FIA makes me not even want to watch races anymore when you can always count on them to damage the integrity of the race every single time. Until F1 has proper referees this sport is a complete joke and honestly if I were the teams I would rally and refuse to race until they fix this issue.
Yeah, i'm gonna give up on this year. Its far too preticable - I really hoped the new regs would shake things up, alas, one person is winning.
Garbage race
And the winner takes it all... 24 seconds?! Honda
I'm amazed to see how few people actually know how to spell George Russell's name correct...
is FIA british ?
Upgraded track works for me now the other teams gotta catch up to red bull
Again max winner it'll be boring😅
Cheating car won again, boring! Shame on you Fraudmula 1 & Shamebull!
Im just happy to see lewis get P2 and George get P3!!! Brilliant race for mercedes today! 👍👍
Ugh merc back on podiums you hste to see it. Im not a Red Bull fan max winning is getting boring too
I wish Hass was some what competitive
I admire how the commentators pretend to be excited by DRS overtaking. Because they're not like for real, right?
Max, the future greatest of all time!!
8 minutos viendo la recta principal
Perez had a big shot at P3....
MERCEDES IS FAST
Lovely ❤
Not a Tsunoda fan, but that penalty on him was BS. And what a costly one for him and his team.
Get ready for “GP2 GP2!” from princess Alonso 😂 😂😂!!!
I need an explanation for why Yuki given a penalty.... clear statement would help us the race perhaps
if we take max out of the equation, that’s race would’ve been exciting 😅
Man YUKI caught a bad break but it’s awesome watching him turn into a proper Grand Prix driver 🔥🔥
Imagine if Alonso never gets another podium ever again? 😑
lets go mercedes
I used to cut the sound on French version, it’s really not comfortable !!!
How did Tsuki get a penalty for doing the same thing as Max on lap 1!! 😂😂
Top 5 Bored gps
Stewards proved themselves not fit for purpose again! F1 has a real problem if this continues.
Mercs are clawing back up the grid it seems. Still a huge gap between them and RB.
Where is Palmer?
23 seconds between the first two cars 😂
Max plays in another league. I remember when there were those who dared to say that Checo was a candidate for the title.🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hammertime coming back!!!
5:50 was that brake dust from alphatauri's car?
At this point,  just allow Verstappen to race alone.  We are super BORED!!!!!  This is worse than the Schumacher years!!!!!
Verstappen wins again...? Yawn.
Who is the commentator? Don't want to be Personal but he is worse then paul di resta
Russell the driver of the day
8 complete minutes of Turn 1 only.
@ F1 why mixing French and English ? It’s total different mood 😢
Ok Russel was pushed off track at the start, but he still gained 1 place and he didnt't give it back, so he should have recieved a penalty
Can Ben Edwards calm down a bit?
So bored ..every games ...max always win
Infelizmente existe ainda um tal de MAX atrapalhando o esporte da Fórmula 1. O piloto que estiver lutando para vencer, pode ser induzido a um acidente, vezes provocado pelo tal de Max.
Man that commentator is annoying.
YUUUKI NOOOOOOO
So basically it's a Mercedes 1 - 2. Since the fraudster has an illegal car
Verstappen running  someone out of road again at the first corner, shock
We are checking 😂😂
Seriously ?! Why isnt anybody talking about BOTH Mercs on the Podium ?!
marilah download bacaan Al-Quran dalam telefon pintar pasanglah di mana sahaja bacalah bersama keluarganya marilah membaca memahami Al-Quran ilmunya dengan PENGASIH dan PENYAYANG Wallahua'lam
Who is the most number 2 of number 2 drivers, Mark Webber or Sergio Perez?
I sense a silly season coming, so many drivers looked sad/unsatisfied in the post race interviews. Especially Sainz, Leclerc and Norris
Very lovely
Well done Max.  Ashtray is to the right of your steering wheel. Do not forget to extinguish the cigar on exit.  Were you able to select tonight's dinner from the onboard menu?
Max Feels like steeling candy from a child..
Wrong decision on Tsunoda
Same result,, Verstappen wins,, formula 1 is so boring now,,I get more excitement painting..
C'est une blague ce montage ya pas de son pendant la moitié!
Was still a dull race in my opinion. Spending the whole race everywhere they go managing tyres is killing the action. Someone comes up behind them and there's barely any defending the position, even if it's against someone you're not racing with they just let each other by. I don't expect everyone to agree with me here but if they had a tyre that lasted the whole race but meant that you had to slow these cars down a bit then the racing would be far better even with different cars.
It was nice to see Max and Lewis up there!! Oh and Russel lol
Same result,, Verstappen wins,, formula 1 is so boring now,,I get more excitement painting..
Isn't there drivers other than those born in England? Certainly Isn't the 'world game'
People are so dumb, Zhou got ahead of Yuki and was forced off.
Yuki’s penalty is a travesty
People complaining about the penalty don’t understand the rules of F1. If you are ahead overtaking on the outside, the driver defending on the inside has to leave racing room. Simple as that. Zhou was ahead on the outside and Yuki didn’t leave space… they know what they’re doing breaking late and keeping momentum to end up on the outside of the corner. Its a slam dunk and thems is the rules. I guess people can be forgiven thinking it harsh because it isn’t applied to the drivers at the head of the field and in particular Max.
Where is the competition? Are people enjoying this?
Ferrari is slow...
But where’s Crofty?
Merc killed it today
Love the commentary together with David Coulthard ……. Much better than that subjective and chauvinistic lot of Sky Sports F1
What a boring race. Only at the End of the Startstraight will be the Overtakes. At the next Race, you need only one Camera at this Position. Formula One was the King of Racing, now its the most boring Raceseries. F1 loose me to MotoGP.
ı never see such an boring race ever. I watched first 10 minute and then slept the whole race
Nice for Hamilton and Perez
If Yuki didnt take off Zhou at that time, Zhou could pass Ocon bc he had the pace. Well deserved penalty and I hope the japanese get out F1 to leave space to more educated people.
Ocon almost crash Alonso to the pitwall and no punish and to harsh with Yuki Tsunoda. FIA stench.
I’m sure RedBull is wondering about Mercedes as a threat after this race.
How did Yuki receive a penalty for that? Zhou was the one who aborted the overtake and Yuki was in front....
Fernando Alonso ❤❤❤❤
I am totally disgusted at the racist and derogatory remark made by that racist English commentator, Martin Brundle today (June 4, 2023) at the 2023 F1 Spanish GP. In this year of 2023, to call the Alfa Romeo driver, Zhou Guangyu a “Chinaman” is totally inappropriate and unacceptable.   I am hopefully that the FIA and Sky Sports, which is promoting motor racing to the whole world, including Asia, will take appropriate action against this racist commentator. I am hoping he is banned from further commentator duties with this world renowned organization and apologize to Zhou Guangyu.
Mampus firari
I remember verstappen forcing leclerc in a lot worse fashion that didnt lead to any penalty...we need Consistency on these calls please
he can't even overtake without DRS 🥱
Even max was bored 😂
F1 is getting boring again.
No Safety Car today, bit boring.
yuki said he wasnt worried about devries coming in and showing him up and this year its obvious theres a massive gap between them
I’m growing REALLY tired of the lead car being allowed to run other cars on the outside, which is already a longer line, off of the racing surface.🙄  While the leader has a right to the road directly ahead of him, to say that they also have the right to the road outside of his line is to give to the disadvantage of any pursuit.🤦🏾‍♂️
Feeling bad for Leclerc being way behind
Max is amazing i love that he keeps dominating races even tho it's a little boring but it's much better than fighting and losing
Such a dull race today. Was hoping for an Alonso win. 1 star race tops. Will be cancelling my subscription until 2024
Bring back the tv casters!!!!
Once again, booooooooooooring!
Great to see Merc upgrades working but sad to see Ferrari losing ground … we need Merc Ferrari and redbull  in the fight
Doesn’t sound the same without croftys commentary
Missing It's lights out and away we go🙂
that so boring race, again redbull was dominate the race
What the F**errari
How this race became an 8 minute highlight reel baffles me
Che campionato ridicolo, la RB sta correndo contro se stessa...
Where's Crofty?
Ferrari is simply embarrassing… I don’t have hopes even for the next 2 years, the car is bad, the strategies are even worse…
The other channel commentators are too Mercedes-like. Every time Mercedes in the frame they will gave extra comments. On top of the Mercedes pit interview.
Max Verstappen reminds me of Hayato Kazami
This Race Weekend was verry boring
Lewis did well …. First of the losers 😅😊😊😊😊
🎉 Mercedes
The best overtake of the race was not on this video (Lance Stroll on Hamilton) What a Shame !
Em 94 acharam que Senna ia ganhar todas as corridas, modificaram um monte de coisa e mataram o Senna. Max está ganhando todas as corridas e não fazem nada. Mais um motivo para eu continuar pensando que mataram o Senna.
Welcome back Mercedes 👌
How'd they get 8 minutes of highlights, I watched this whole thing and I can't think of 8 minutes of it I'd want to watch again lol
Every F1 race: Verstappen takes the lead on the first corner! Fast forward to the end of the race: and Verstappen wins! Lame
How they’ve stretched these highlights out to 8 minutes is amazing
where is crofty.
Since Formula 1 is officially an engineering competition, why don't they just replace the drivers with A.I. robots?
Season gets more and more boring
Ojala sigan subiendo los resúmenes en español gracias
NUVEI 😎🙌🙌 two podiums today!
Without DRS there wouldn't be much overtaking. Think i'd rather get rid of DRS though and just have cars designed like they were in F1's glory days
I'm sick of seeing just Trashtappen winning
Mercedes has easily got the best driver pairing of all the teams this year. Many have one driver of excellent quality but few have two of the same outstanding quality.
Can we all just take a minute to appreciate that Lance passed Lewis on track on merit.
Why the redbull discriminates it's Owen driver for max,it's clearly visible.that's against the sports menship.
It isn't the season of Lando Norris. He ranks sixth or nineth. Last season he finished third (perhaps fourth). Behind Verstappen and Perez. How do we explain this backlash?
max sounded so incredibly joyful after that win 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Congratulations once again to max verstappen looks like he’s unstoppable and he’s going for his third world title
Yawn
Please remove Carlos sainz and change the car for leclerc
Can we get the crofty commentary please? thanks
Did Aston Martin mess up Alonsos car? How did they get so slow
Max is just doing tourism at this point...
Remember when F1 wasn’t boring
Ocon... Son of a b
what yuki penalty yet nothing for ocon?
Yuki driving hard vs Zhou, racing incident for sure, he was just scared ..
Terrible decision to penalize Yuki. That was a fair battle. He didn't force Zhou off the road at all.
What a boring race 😞
Ferrari ne veulent pas passer au karting c mieux je pense que de se foutre la honte à chaque grand prix!!!
This is no longer racing!!! How one teams dominates the whole race calender!!! Are we back to the Mercedes Hamilton days!!
Getting boring... 🥱
Even Max sounds bored
Feel for Lando, he was just unlucky in turn 2, McLaren just can't have anything in 2023
ocon a bit disappointing.... but what a race mercedes!!!
zha germans won't quit 😀
Why no penalty for George? He is getting a lot benefit from FIA. Took wrong way and gained 5 to 6 place in 1st lap itself.
very lovely
Look at all the usernames of the tsunoda comments lol
The decision on the Jhou and Tsunodar incident was questionable yeah nah?
Quite a boring and dull race. Miss the wheel to wheel action. Every one is just busy managing the tires.
ഉറങ്ങാൻ പോകൂ കുട്ടികളേ
my lord is this season boring
0 Yellow flag.
Max Verstappen and Red Bull Honda.. and the Mercedes AMG come buck. Barcelona GP was just like a nightmare for Ferrari and McLaren.
Anyone else here because the sound cuts out ½ way through F1 TVs highlights video? 😂
Yuki absolutely did not deserve that penalty. That was ridiculous. Never in a million years would he have gotten that if he was Verstappen. Great to see the Merc's somewhat competitive again, well at least against everyone but Red Bull. The fact that Perez still finished 4th is absurd.
To dts kids who are saying Russell cheated his overthinking id kindly recommend you watch the onboard and not ruin the fan base he didn't gain a single position if he did the entire grid would be on an uproar
Lando robbed of his entire race.
Another super boring race
Como nos hace falta Latifi para darle mas emotividad
I don't get how someone can watch this when there are GTs, prototypes, V8 supercars... wait for long straight>turn on DRS>with the help of the slipstream AND DRS make a pass long before the straight is even over. WOW! Not to mention the slightest touch forces them to pit. F that
Such a boring race, again... such a shame RedBull is so dominant, GGs to them though
Williams & Ferrari, вероятно старожилы - рекордсмены на данный момент в F1? Ровесник Алонсо показал чудеса на виражах. Он выступал ещё бок о бок с Монтойей. Как сложилась карьера Хуана Пабло?
Weldon Mercedes guys
So bummed for Lando. But I do love that they’re keeping that livery, their standard one is terrible.
Porque insisten en usar estos locutores de F1?? La misma emoción que mirar una partida de ajedrez ...😢😢😢
Bring back Crofty!!!
Me watching race highlights after watching the race😂 anyone else weird like that
Great race
Has Crofty retired?
Leclerc still useless medioker 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Well done Russel, don't like Hamilton, shame for Alonso and Norris. Verstappen 1st lame as always.
Glad to see Yuki get a 5 sec penalty for pushing Zhou of the road while Russell makes up 4 places outside the track and the stewards find nothing wrong with that. That’s fair I guess 🎉
Ocon almost Rosberged Alonso but this time near pitwall
If yuki got 5 sec penalty, then shouldn't ocon  get a bigger penalty.?
Missed the first 1/4 of the race, did they say why Russell didnt get a penalty for gaining an advantage by going off on the first corner? Looked like he jumped a couple cars
this is getting ridiculous. he won by 23s this time.
Alonso has no figuratively and literally left alpine in the dust
perfect narration in english
This is why the DRS implementation should be revised. These aren't race highlights, these are just a compilation of people switching positions on the straight with next to no chance for the car ahead to defend.
So all Mercedes needed was a sidepod…
Can anyone explain Ferrari
Nice to see toto smile
What are Ferrari doing ? With all these people …they can’t get things done and they have 2 great drivers
These guys doing commentary is plan awful fix it
Hamilton is back on grid.
I don't like this New comantater
we want back david please
Now that Mercedes is on an upwards curve don't expect to see  Alonso on the podium too many more times.
Grand Slam for Max!
Hamilton was smooth today, would have won the race by about 40sec if he were in that red bull.
Lewis can better go to retirement. Max is the best in this time.
I want a team radio between Zhou and tsunoda but it will be Chinese and Japanese..like a cursing one 😅
I think switching places with yuki and Zhou would be fine but not 5 sec penalty
Whoo! Merc strikes back!
The Red Bull team radios are the most Boring! They also never thank their team behind the scenes. Feels toxic!
So now red bull is the next Mercedes 🤔.  Smh why can't they get more competitiveness as this is very boring for fans.
Glad Hamilton didn’t win with that ridiculous helmet.
Everyone about Yuki but Norris is so much more unlucky and if you watched crofty commentary it sounded like they were blaming him
Ferrari should sold their team ... The worst team ever
Леклер без плана Е,B,C
Russels bangs into hammilton during qualifying, no penalty. Leaving the track and gaining a big advantage, no penalty. There is no way russel isn't giving head to the stewards tonight 😂😂
Was irritating to see Perez's charge to gain places and trying to catch up with Russell was ignored and cameras focussed on Leclerc's boring drive in 12th place.
I hope FIA goes after Red Bull in the same manner they tried to "nerf" Mercedes throughout the years. This car is abnormal.
Mercedes should be able to fight for wins in the next three races.
Parece mentira que con25 años Max lleve ya 40 victorias y Alonso se quedó con 32 😂😂. No tiene rival el neerlandés, su tercer mundial ya esra al caer. Grande Max !!
F1 These first few races were boring, with no competitors for the lead and another dominant team as Mercedes were .
There are actually highlights of this race?
Congratulations to Red Bull; unfortunately, boring championship.
ダッチドライバー強し。メルセデスが表彰台に2人登るのはいつぶりなんだろうか。アロンソは残念だったが、パーマネントに置いて、いよいよ本格的に中盤戦に入った。まだまだ先は長いから何があるかわからない、80年代ならすでにダッチドライバー、シリーズチャンピオン獲得になっている。
FIA is really dogshit👎👎　 They should have placed yuki to p9.
Nah man, now you can just drove off track and claim you was push off and win a position free... Not to call zhou, he's just watching for himself and fantastic job getting points for alfa romeo, but the stewards penalizing yuki for that...  🤨
Verstappen runs the F1 championship alone. The others, starting from the second (who arrived with a gap of 24 seconds) run another one.
Alonso has an apartment in Ocon's head
No one is talking about Checo!  The guy is in Max’s shadow, but he’s out there making just as many over takes as Russel.  Great drive!
24 seconds in front of second place, Max will be time traveling soon
The races are becoming increasingly boring to watch
Verstappen killing it like usual 😎
Max in a class of his own. Even the new Mercedes upgrades, and they're still 24 seconds behind 😅
I just wan one more season , where Max and Lewis both be competitive and have battle for championship like in 2021
Max sounds bored! Was Yuki’s penalty because the FIA can’t go a race without messing up in some way 🤷🏻‍♂️
Borring race , without interesting emotions, without competition the championship loses interest
Russell drove an insane race, idk how Lulu got the DOTD
Muy bien checo, buen trabajo, max es un monstruo!!!
Taunoda deserved points. I don't get the reason behind the penalty
why are the highlights no longer having Crofty and Brundle commentate?
EVEN VERSTAPEN GETTING BORED
Ya estoy cansado que gane Verstappen, no hay equilibrio en la F1 antes fue la supremacia de Hamilton ahora este Verstappen, se me hincharon las bolas no miro mas la FI.
Ferrari doing Ferrari things
Gran Chelems!
Congratulations to Mercedes side pods
I usually read the comments. But this time, its useless Mostly people saying Yuki did not deserve the penalty and that Ocon should have got a penalty
Why did they pir perez for fastest lap. Should've been podium for him. Lol
Nice race 🎉🎉🎉
That red Bull is unstoppable man truly gutted he’s not having to actually race to defend his title
Verspatten is killing the sport, unfair advantage with a faster car, bratty attitude and boring racing..
AR can't seem to catch a break,  I wish Bottas had a faster car :(
Ocon move reminded me of what Shumacher did to Rubens in 2010
Yuki penalty is unnecessary
Great job from Lewis once again , that team and Lewis is making some nice progress compared to the beginning of the season, also hats off to Adrian and the RedBull team those cars are the ones to beat, nice race today, no safety cars or red flags.
Everyone's talking bout Tsunoda penalty but no ones talking bout Zhou getting that Alfa into the pointa.
Most boring race of the season so far
The diffenrence between Monaco and the rest...
I found this to be such a boring race, i fell asleep during parts of it. With Red Bull as strong as they are.  This always happens. There's almost always a team that is far superior to the rest of the field and often its for like 5 years. I don't know how to fix the issue
If Carlos had passed Max in the first corner…
Ocon just went full Mazepin. Never go full Mazepin.
The commentary is just horrible, have to watch these muted...
If that’s the highlights the race live must have been a real drag.
what a great performance by Zhou in the second slowest car! He definitely should stay longer
No one talking about the hass just tumbling down the order through the race 😢
Such drive from Max Verstappen reminds of Vettel and Red Bull Era from 2010 to 2013... Unbeatable
Not a single yellow flag, safety car, or retirement. One driver led every lap.
Sorry FIA ,but I do clearly see that Russel was alongside Piastri, goes escape-road, joins back before Piastri and never gives the place back. Russel started behind McLaren and Haas, drives to first corner just next-behind them. Pulls alongside in turn 1 then leaves track between 1 and 2 for escape. So ridiculous he did not got penalty or call to give the place back as first anyway.
Penalty for Tsunoda but no one for Ocon??? 😂
Sainz choking on his home GP
Hamilton pulling back great fights regardless of the car's problems. great to see!
24 seconds between P1 and P2 is absurd.
We need lights out and here we gooooo. What a disastrous commentary it was!!
1
This formula one is a boring sport.
I miss: LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO
Yuki got a penalty but Ocon didn’t get one on the Alonso interaction 🤔
max is the world champion this time , he took his early lead in the points table so now is gonna be relaxed
Mercedes berhasil mengikuti arahan rb..
I'm so happy to see both Mercedes back on podium!
red bull winning every race this season won’t even be surprising
Absolute BS penalty on Tsunoda there. No reason that should be a penalty. Ocon's move against Alonso should have been though. Very dangerous.
My goodness, I knew Verstappen was the show, P1 thru-out the weekend. Fastest in all 3 practices, pole, and top it off with the win, that's amazing! Let's go Red Bull!!! 🏁
Alonso's heroic efforts getting crushed. Crush him once and for all so he can go cry in the corner.
Max is in a different league - the gap to Perez speaks oodles to this.
I hope this was the first and the last time i heard the comment in french. Please, just leave the engines noise for the next time, id rather watch wnba than listening to this❤️
How did Yuki get a penalty but Gorge goes into turn one behind Piastri, goes of track and then rejoins ahead of him???
Mercedes machines at work again  !!
RedBull productos tóxicos
RedBull productos tóxicos
supermaxmaxsupersuper will win the DC.
Highlights? Were there any?
Tsunoda move wasn't a clean one, but that's racing. A B&W flag would have been enough
RedBull productos tóxicos
ABURRIDA TEMPORADA, que ya declaren a MV, campeón y que compitan los demás para que haya más emoción y esto tenga más sentido.
RedBull toxico
Well done Russell! 9 places!
Verstappen is the best of all time
Que pasa con Pérez ? Le cambiaron el auto
RedBull productos tóxicos
Alonso vs Ocon... redemption from Alonso
Hmm here comes the mercs again double podium!
DRS: The Race
Poor noris he did so well yesterday
Well it seems there might be competition at the front 2024
who the heck is this commentator?... where's the "... it's lights out, and away we go ..." 🤷‍♂😁
Bring back old commentators
Mercedes doble podium Not bad 7:27
again the little girl won the race, now she's not going to cry right.
Yeah Mercedes
who is this little boy on commentary, bring back crofty
Where are you crofty
Very exciting races! You never know who wins and you always have to wait for the last lap! P.S. For me this year the world championship will be won by Verstappen...
Max let's go 2023 season F1 is your🤗
Ferrari just like an amateur team 😅
They've really managed to trim the budget by only needing one camera for one corner these days. Seeing this more and more with this formula and these tracks.
Honestly from zhous perspective it does kinda look like yuki was suddenly turning into him so he tried to not make contact and ended up off track
BORING
LOL , 1/2 a minute ahead for MV ....
Miss the old narrator
What’s going on with Ferrari? 2nd to 5th
Funny watching Carlos try to make the move, as if anyone thinks they can actually compete against the redbull
Russell stinks
What happened to the Ferrari team? Are they working at all? It lost its glory.. poor dynamics and poor drivers as well.  Ferrari fans like us are really worried about the future..
Another poor show from Ferrari. After each race they upgrade there cars but there is hardly any improvement.
F1 these days 🥱
Another boring predictable F1 race
Get rid of DRS
Alonso's passing on ocon has to be the highlight of this race even though ocon forgets the fact that it was Alonso who helped him win the hungarian gp last year by holding off hamilton as much as he could.
Another really annoying loud commentar
That penalty for Yuki is not deserved!!
no upgrade no more podiums astonmartin
this was not a race this was a thumping by max verstappen almost 24 seconds ahead the second place car.
How far Ferrari has fallen!
best race of the year so far imo
Ferrari Ferrari oh Ferrari
Boring ☹️
Red Bull and Verstapen are out of this world. It may be wonderful for the bulls, but for the rest of the fans we are feeling the years of Lewis and Mercedes dominance...
What a boring F1 Grand Prix.
Mercedes is cooking   Ferrari is refrigerating
Yuki got robbed with that unnecessary penalty
perez should have done better if he weants to be a world champion
Where is David Croft?
Yuki didn't push Zhou off at all he just defended his position
give us back crofty and brundle :/
Please stop making the sound with the localisation i've got in french and there is absolutly no sound in the middle of the video for a long period. Please let us hear in english
Game Over for Ferrari...Said...
So boring. 30 years watching f1. Is time to stop. I wonder what happened to all the people complaining in hamilton's era .It was boring, it s the same now.
Yuki's penalty was poor by the Stewards. Goes on the inside & Zhou bails out of it with a half-hearted attempt to hold position. It was a natural & classic overtaking manoeuvre into T1 which we've seen many times, no idea how that rewards a 5s penalty & a penalty point...  Otherwise, I thought the racing felt better without the lazy chicane in the final sector. Mercedes also with both cars back on the podium with the new upgrades tested properly!
The Verstappen Win Reaction is priceless
Ferrari being Ferrari
As always boring race in Spain
Yuki should be P9
When everyone is talking about Yuki's penalty more than the race. What a shameful punishment he received from stewards. 😡😡
It is boring to see same driver taking P1 every race. There's no competition there and the whole 23 season will remain the same.
You already know master Xi made the call and Yuki was penalized
🥱
Nice to see the Mercedes in the top 3 again, still 23+ seconds behind Verstappen though
Max is insufferable. That last communication
法拉利真的爛透了⋯⋯
👍
Bravo Zhou! Amazing race!
Sheesh. Do yall think that the 5 second penalty was too harsh? He was doing phenomenal imo
I felt so bad for Lando when I watched this. I was hoping he might make it to the podium. But it was cool to see bothe Mercedes drivers on the podium.
For Next highlights GP.. please comments in spanish... Salute from Venezuela
Schumacher did the same move as ocon to alonso on barrichello in the 2010 hungarian gp and got a 10 place grid penalty in the next race
So Russell is allowed to go of track and gain advantage?
Princess George & Lady Hamilton 😂😂😂...
Max even started on the mediums to give ‘em a chance
For those who argue there is no cheating in F1 … look who gets penalties and who does not. If you don’t see it, see an ophthalmologist ASAP.
This broadcast was pretty bad, no matter what was happening they wouldnt stop talking about mercedes. At least try and control the bias.
Checo el mejor
Max verstappen wins the Canadian Grand Prix
Getting boring how Red Bull dominates just like Mercedes did
Zhou I love you but he didn't push you off. If he was getting far too close for comfort leaving you no choice, fine but he didn't. You backed out.   FIA sort your stuff out. Take back Yuki's penalty. He didn't do anything wrong.
😴 😴😴
Max the Great 👍
Man Perez chased so many times, goat
HAMILTON IT SHALL BE WELL
anyone else finds f1 getting more and more boring recently?
Great all Landos great work ruined in the first minute ☹️
😎💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥#40 Wins for M.V. 💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🏆🏆🏆
💤💤💤 BOOORRRRIIINNNNGGGG
Apparently Russell is an Aitch fan...  Wagwan, what's goin' on?" "Why am I wet?" Gyal, that's rain...
RedBull should kick Perez out and get Lando Norris on board
vraiment pas sympa!
Ocon being a piece of idiot as always with Fernando
"Red bulle"
Verstappen be like "Today there's no competition in the front"
These races are evolving into the weekly parade. If not for your jacked up announcers we have super boring races these days.
quel voix!???
Alonso should have done Soft and then if possible 2 round of Hards all in
Shame about the black on the podium
If Yuki got a 5 second penalty how come max didn't get one for doing the same to sainz?
Poor yuki so unlucky this year
Zhou bottled it on that corner, wasnt forced off😂😂
If it wasn't for max Mercedes would still be winning races and championships
boring....
Votre commentateur francais est ennuyant a mort ... aucune information importantes. Je préfère Pierre Houde de RDS.
What a boring race😊
Bro what is Ferrari’s problem .. sighzz.. they just can’t hold on to the podium 😢…
Totally boring and F1 is trash we see that they just want Redbull dominating
Max Verstappen Championship
Why isn't crofty commentating
Boring
Out of all the seasons in F1, 2023 season is definitely a season that is happening.
Alonso definitely taught Esteban how to defend like a lion
Imagine being a Ferrari fan and a Chelsea at the same time
ancora una volta leclerc delude... nemmeno tra i primi 10...
Very nice amount of overtaking in today’s race.  Having DRS for the entire main straight made this possible along with the track reconfigure to remove the chicane.  Wish F1 would have lengthened the DRS at Baku instead of shortening it, as I think it would have made for a more exciting race there.  Maybe next year.  Nice win for Max, great to see the Mercs back on the podium.
Booooooring race
Max is making it boring 😢
7 minutes of overtakings before turn 1
Max is amazing 🔥🔥
It will be an exciting race if we ignore Max😅
Boring, yawn ,yawn, boring, F1 bore off
Another one boring season 😢
​🔥🔥SUPERMAX🔥🔥
I think we all feel like max is just being winning easy, and it seem that way but he’s driving so solid it’s insane
Nice Work FIA, awesome 🖕🇬🇧
ocon still 💩like always 🖕
VER is too dominant. His car is on steriods...just see the gap in the standings.
there was AT LEAST another 3 times where someone "forced" another driver out on the same corner Yuki got a penalty, but only Yuki gets the penalty...
Do you think Verstappen gets bored during these races?
Max and Lewis are just on a different level to the rest of the field
perez mexico
If you only watched the highlights you’d have no idea there are more corners at Barcelona than the first 3.
2:56 is clear eyesight not a requirement for a commenter on the F1 broadcast? There was clearly contact here and they are talking about how close it was…
bad idea to pit Parez in lap 51 should have been 4-5 laps before ... late pit stop cost him the podium...
More than a pitstop distance from 1st to 2nd + pulling 1s a lap on a harder compound is just absolutely ridiculous
Que aburrido es ver a Judastapen con el mejor coche y sin competencia.
one word: boring
The pit strategy in Aston Martin was disastrous. Alonso could fight for a podium, and this result was the worst of the season.
This race had a highlight?
Leclerc is just a complete nightmare, he drives as if he is a rookie all the time. Definitely doesn't have the wining mentality and not a Ferrari worthy driver.
Obviously Zhou had enough space but he just lacks of skill.
😴
Every week Verstappen will win
Yukis penalty is some bs. No contact was made. You're gonna penalize a guy for having a twitch mid corner?
Ferrari 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
New track layout worked incredibly well imo. Great racing into turn one, there was action almost every lap
Mercedes 1..2...well done
Lewis P2
FERRARI,SAINZ and LECLERC 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Kudos to the intern for the quick upload
What was Ferrari's strategy on Leclerc again ? Starting with hards just to change them after 17 laps...🤦‍♂ Meanwhile Alonso doing nearly 30 on softs...
That rb's floor really works on mercedes 😱
Wyścig
Hello,   Due to the tragic events caused by the floods in Italy that ended up cancelling the Imola Grand Prix, the GP Emilia Romagna I have a possible recovery of the GP and that this year it can be held.   The GP could be held in September after the Monza Grand Prix, the Italian GP.   The distance from Monza to Imola is only 265 kilometres, so the teams could travel there in 24 hours and that would be enough because it is only 4 hours by truck and 3 hours by car.   And therefore it could be held on days 5, 6 and 7 September, including 5 and 6, with only 2 free practice rounds + qualifying on day 5 and the race on day 6. That would give a margin to travel to Singapore for a week and be there on the 15th.   It is feasible to hold it and make it up that month, taking advantage of the fact that they are in Italy and the distance is quite close between Monza and Imola.  Please take this suggestion and opinion into very high consideration to talk with the FIA and Formula 1 managers.  Best regards.
Ferrari is an embarrassment
cLoSeR rACiNg.
Zzzz. So boring.
I wouldn't agree that Mercedes was that much of a success.   Still 30 seconds off Max at the end.
Man asked for sidepods for 18 months - gets em - P2!
This commentary is ridiculous even sound. Plz we need David & Martin...
It's strange that Zhou overtake Hulkenberg three times but haven't a single highlights here
What happened to Lando, from P3 down to P17. Sad🥲
Ferrari is the new Jordan team
They didn't show Alonso saying he won't overtake Stroll and then later where he waved before the race had ended
I'm wondering the differences in lap times between F1 and the Moto GP bikes?? I thinking F1 is probably close to 20+ seconds a lap quicker
Pity for yuki, for sure giving back position can be better than 5 sec after race. Both yuki and Zhou deserve points today
Es una de las mejores partida de la carrera, muy bonita y limpia
Why Russell was not penalized for overtaking everyone via the escape road??
I am happy for Lewis Hamilton thank you team Mercedes from Sénégal 🇸🇳 💪💪💪
Kenya is happy
Turn this 726 k I have placed a bet on it help me ❤❤❤❤❤ please before 11 IST
Russel gained minimum of 1 position by cutting the turn 2, yet no penalty, not giving the position back. Its seems like most of British drivers are always getting special treatment in F1.
i was expecting rain 😢
Is it over? I fell asleep
After such an exciting quaalifying that was such a dissapointing race lol
Ferrari don't have what it takes really this season ... Leclerc been overrated .... This season is done for them
Bore-mula 1
This race, not that fun
😴
Max on 🔥🔥
Thsi season is absolutely boring. Sorry for what iam writing, but how can you enjoy this race when the winner is sure? EQUAL ENGINES pls f1 is no longer what it was
Russell skipped turn 1 at the start and no one said anything
No one actually likes max
Imma be real, bring back Michael Massi. Tsunoda being given a 5 sec penalty is kinda harsh
atlast the merc upgrades showing improvements.
He'll yeah max great job keep it up number 1
Yawn.  More of the same.
Roses are red,  Violets are blue Trust Verstappen,  to always come through
Alguna duda de quien  es el mejor piloto??? Jajajaja saludos hermanos  mexicanos
I wish ferrari to retire from F1..can’t take more 😢😢
no offence, but please ,oh, please bring Crofty back to social media.. hit like if you agree, please 🙏
Too bad about Alanso....
Absolutely ridiculous and biased af penalty for Tsunoda. He deserved points
Super les commentaires de Gaëtan Vigneron sur la chaîne de la Formula 1 🤩🤩😍🙏 Thx guys 👌 (M. Vigneron is our Belgian super reporter, gives Always a lot of infos and statistics, and really lives the GP's with passion 👌)
So Max Verstappen has already won the championship.. after what - round 7?
Yuki got Ocon'd 💀
so boring again....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Quel mauvais descripteur de la course..il fait vraiment paa fort lui... trouver qq qui a de la passion lui est dépassè
David Croft is so much better😂
So Russel was the only one with full wet tyres... No wonder he couldn't beat Hamilton.
Hamilton 24 seconds behind Max 😂😂😂
go max
MID!!!!
A load of undefendable DRS overtakes into turn 1.  Great...
I see they didn't show the Stroll Alonso situation, hmmmm    stroll  daddy's boy!
Merci is finally in competition again! :D
Yuki p9
Man I feel bad for the people who pay to see the same stuff happen weekend after weekend :D
Where is Crofty?
It's so much better when you dont use Crofty as a commentator
I just wanna see lando win 😢.
Perez robbed of a podium, sick strategy
That progress for Mercedes
Max is in that Schumacher early-2000's phase of his career.  Ferrari is to Leclerc's career what the iceberg was to the Titanic.  Russell continues to show that the hype didn't match the talent.  Sargeant showing that really wanting an American driver on the grid doesn't mean there actually should be an American driver on the grid.
Sad for yuki gambare yuki🎉
You guys definitely never see F1 if u said tsunoda shouldnt be charged with penalty
Get in there Lewis!!!
Merc slowly retain back to farm... Lewis Hamilton 🎉🔥
New sidepot mercedes 🎉🎉
Well done Max and red bull. Max lead the entire race even when he went into pit ,he came back out infront and still holds first place. Brother your the best
Zhou had the inside on the second corner, unfortunate for Tsunoda. Although, Zhou couldve done better in that situation.
El rebase de Alonso con Ocon fue legal?, Osea qe se metiera al pasillo del pit lane?
At what point do we just stop and appreciate the excellence of Max?    Yuki got absolutely shafted.  5 seconds for that?  Really?   Why so harsh.  Looked clean to me.
Que aburrido solo el mismo gana buena es parte del circo
FIA, please stop racial discrimination
si scrive Ferrari, si legge FIAT
Where is Crofty
Bravo lewis, bravo george & bravo mercedes 👏
Checos got to be careful from now on, otherwise a honey badger will take his seat next season
Russell climbing up 9 positions is just amazing
YET ANOTHER BORING RACE
Non c'è più gusto guardare questa f1
The same as always with Max, great job by Mercedes (I had no doubt about them performing brilliantly today, as a year ago they weren't doing well, but they raced well in Montmeló and from that moment they started improving their results)
Superb race for the Two Mercedes,even though Red bull still remain dominant. Spain Grand Prix highlights with a lot of cean overtaking moves.....
So this will be the last year in F1 for Bottas....:(
Disappointing perf from Ferrari alpine and Aston
Yuki got the GT7 sterwards on him 😂😂😂
My highlight of the race:  Max: what’s the fastest lap Gp: you have 3 strikes for track limits, not worth it *1 minute later* Max sets fastest lap GP: okay fine, can you now focus on staying within the white lines? Max: yep
Tsunoda gets a penalty for the same move that Verstappen made on the first lap, interesting.
Boring winner race
Stopped watching the full races because I already know who’s gonna win😑
Sergio has to go. I like him, but he's not RedBull material. How you get beat by anyone other than Max while driving a RB is mind blowing
Another lazy Sunday afternoon snoozefest 🥱💤
Mercedes almost get comeback points, Red Bull still on lead, Aston Martin gone 3rd after Mercedes gets podium points, I feel bad to Noris and Yuki...
Hi Max, estas en serios problemas jajajajajaj
George really thought that it was raining but turns out it was his sweat 💀.  Sad to see Lando fall from P3 to nearly last.
carlos finishing a respectable P5 after starting from.........P2.
How they got 8 minutes of highlights from this race baffles me
Terrible call for Yuki, did not deserve the penalty. He was brilliant
Gutted for Lando 😢
Que aburrido 🥱 está fórmula 1,
that was a flop by zhou
Where is the basic comentator? 😢 This is so not right! 😂
Ah yes.. the 'excitement' of F1... Zzz..
Bring back Skysports Commentary
Bet Piastri is loving his move to Mclaren so much right about now
Remember when the F1 bosses said that the new regulations would 'lead to closer racing'...  Verstappen finished 24 seconds ahead of the next car as well as out qualifying the next best driver by half a second. Where 7 races into the season and Verstappen already has a two race buffer over the next best driver.   We are facing a 'Schumacher 2002' situation where Max could barring any engine troubles finish on the podium of every GP this season and have the title wrapped up with a quarter of the season left. Unless you're a Red Bull fan, I think most of us would like someone else to compete for race wins.
Those early enough would've spotted the typo in the description!!
How can there be 8 min of highlights… nothing really happened and nearly all overtakes took place on the Main Straight 😴😴😴🥱🥱🥱
What are mclaren doing they put lando on the hards for 22 laps
Best move of the race? Natalie overtaking SImon as Sky F1 host, figuratively speaking. ;)
Chatisse, entretenimento pra ver quem fica em segundo
Happy to see Mercedes is back on top 😊
Lord Jesus, please send lots of rain soon... Amen
"Passing left, right and center". At the middle and back of the field. Up front, same faster CAR.
Verstatten
Max is4Long the Best driver ,gonna be a Legend SOON....
props to the camera crew for this race as well as Monaco!
Max is in a league of his own out there
1:30 Bro toasted en entire country
what out, here comes the juggernauts
Great pit for “Verstaten”
Me alegro mucho por Hamilton
Gano como siempre la arrogancia de no ser un buen perdedor la mera ver ga pen 😅😅😅 por siempre nuestra raza checo mexi
What happened to lights out ha
Ferrari ??????
Ferrari might as well just give up on F1 now. Red bull and Mercedes have much better cars. Embarrassing
Tad sad only turn one has ALL the action (in the replays anyway).  😕
This commentators are so baddd 😢
The Penalty for TSUNODA is Absolutely Crazy, but he was keeping calm in radio. TSUNODA is a fantastic driver.
Preying for the day when the fastest car doesn't always win
Great drive by Zhou
That Mercedes pass on Sainz was satisfying
Saved money and time by not subscribing to F1 pro live to watch these boring races Give the championship to max already
For anyone who thinks the car Carries Verstappen just look at perez… and him in a comparison he’s just 100x better
I feel bad for yuki, he did deserve a penalty for that but he shouldn't have actually gotten one since the stewards are very inconsistent in the first place
Let's go Hamilton!!!!!!!! ❤️
Boring! Let’s pass the championship to Verstappen and allow us to see interesting racing 😊
Hopefully this track will stay on the calendar Not again another streetcircuit just for the dollars A bit of respect for the sport and the drivers please
When you think Monaco is the most boring race of the calendar, yet Barcelona beats it. zZzZzzZz
I couldn't understand Yuki's penalty after no penalty on Ocon toward Fernando.
Is this upgaradr from ferrari
Yawn
Yawn....
It is amazing  how nobody  crashed.
Max today's performance >> Seb Singapore 2013
wow Verstappen won? That is so surprising, I never saw that coming. I wonder who will win next race?
Best race so far this season?
feel sorry for norris
Tsunoda does a milder move than Verstappen does every other race, and gets penalized, hilarious!
It’s great to watch formula 1 again thanks to Max spanking Hamilton and Mercedes at every race so far this season Thank you Max! And congrats on win 40
Were there any highlights?
Awkward podium. Max can't even muster being sociable to Mercedes.
Where is voice : the lights out and we go?????
I don’t even wake up to watch these anymore I already know who’s gonna win
another super exciting race - not. :(
This was an interesting way to make it seem like the Merc upgrades were effective. The Ferrari's pace still burns out half way through the race, just like I said it would, but it also appears someone talked to AM about finishing races in front of their supplier. I know its embarrassing for the Merc team, but watching the strategy calls to make the Mercs seem quick is even more embarrassing for F1. Overall, nothing has changed, and its going to be hard for AM to find a way to finish behind the Mercs for the rest of the year. The F1 team agengas are starting to show. Ferrari is a lost cause at this point, we'll see how long Fernando will stay quiet about the politics.
Happy for Mercedes guys 🎉😊
Let me say it clear. This season is done for ferrari!!!!. Enough of the pain we suffer race to race. There needs some serious change in the team management or else it is gonna be the same
oh boy the Ferrari updates are clearly working
Go Hamilton!!
what a snoozefest
It's sad that no one talks about Bottas, Gasly & Albon anymore! They are really doing a lot better than Yuki & Ferrari!
Such a lame race😢
P2 P3 for us
How boring F1 has become, when the highlights of the race are backmarkers you no it's failed.
Ocon block skill:100
Crazy people get stuck on the fad of bashing Monaco when there's perpetual snoozers like Barcelona that no one says anything about. At least Monaco has the atmosphere, the history, and the most exciting Saturday on the calendar. I guess the Spanish GP is OK if you're a fan of watching only DRS flybys.
I’m sure hammy will complain about his car
How on earth does that Leclerc strategy make sense?? Out in Q1 = loads of soft tyres unused. So he starts on hards (fine, go long) except he doesn’t go long and only does 18 laps on them, pits for softs and does 25 laps, pits again on lap 43 and puts on 25-lap-old hards for the final stint??😵‍💫🤔 …what?!? Utter dog show of a car in race trim. And the strategists time and again look clueless to boot  Again, the two things Ferrari had to work on from last year were 1) peculiar strategy calls, and 2) the car being too harsh on its tires on Sunday. And they’ve improved sweet stuff all on both counts👌
Alonso's overtake was epic tho
Great move by Bottas supporting his team mate Zhou. The way he defended!
Ferrari is still nothing without Michael Schumacher !
Yuki didn't deserve the pénalty
*SO MUCH OVERTAKING*
cars overtake other cars in a straight line for 90mins
How did Yuki get a penalty for that.. The FIA are on cracky magoo 😞
🔴Ferrari No.1 always
Max 👍
Did they change the old commentators or does it change based on where youre watching from? Someone PLEASE tell me
Yes Mercedes is back baby!!!
Never mind Verstappen killing it. The fact RB were consistently getting 2.5 second pit stops is testament to the notion that its not just about the drivers, but more about the entire RB team. Every single one of them has been flawless, and its whats made them unstoppable.
Tsunoda's penalty is a bit weird. Not even close, appear to be enough space for both, Zhou chickened out and took the exit route before complaining. If thats worthy of time + point penalty, then so many people wouldve gotten it before. Ocon's very aggressive defense against Alonso is a lot more dangerous at that speed, Alonso couldve lost control and hit the pit exit barrier, tho thats highly improbable for someone with his skills. FIA not being consistent is always true no matter the era.
Incredible how George can pass two people off track and not receive a penalty. 🇬🇧 bias all day
Max just be breezing by 😂
Ferrari wie immer ekn grossen 0🤬
BORING RACE
What's the rest of the track like? I only saw the same 2 or 3 turns during the whole highlights.
It's gonna be extremely difficult but that Verstappen guy might have a chance at the championship. He seems to be doing very well.
Verstappen takes the lead…..and keeps extending it……every single race
When will people start boo'ing Max like what happened to Vettel when people got bored of him winning ?
RAIN IN TURN 5!!!
really starting to miss "Lights out and away we go!"
We need better commentary
It was a sweaty day!
please fire whoever this commentator is
Yap i told u Maxx no counter
For God's sake, there was a car in perfect condition to Sir Lewis Hamilton, today's race only showed how little shame F1 is, how does RBR get ahead of the Sir Lewis Hamilton 20s, how? 😡😡😡
Not a single comment on Hamilton here..
Russell overtakes Piastri outside of the track and no penalty was given. Fishy.
More proof F1 stewards have lost the plot.  A penalty for Yuki for that was ridiculous
What happened to "lights out and away we go?"
Why are they replacing crofty commentary on theor social media
Most boring F1 season in recent memory.  Terrible.
This season has been really horrendous thus far
This is the max era🎉
Max is unstoppable and the past present and future super mega star of F1
So Yuki was penalised for racing? What a joke!!
Being a McLaren fan these days is tough...unlucky 😩😩😩
Can't believe how slow the Ferraris are now!
What YUKI did？　He just defensed Zhou
Макс похоже задолбался выигрывать )
Boring!!!
What happened to the Aston Martins?
Stroll in top 10 proves even a blind chimpanzee can get lucky and Horner getting mad at Rosberg’s questions post race was the highlight of the day.
Que carrera más aburridas las de este año no hay competencia red Bull el mejor coche cualquiera lo lleva a la meta final en primer lugar
Yuki TSUNODA is the most skilful driver on grounds
Can next year f1 kick out Williams get Honda or some new team. Honda already got great engine let’s hop in f1. Williams there for nothing.
Turn 1 highlights 😂
Boooooooring
8 minutes of highlights??? I had a bad that it would be impossible to squeeze out 30 seconds of highlights
The special edition livery on the McLaren looks fantastic.
red bull cant be that far ahead. F1 is a joke.   Not competitive  at all.  Just ask who comes behind red bull
"Lauda" in a Rush movie was right for Ferrari car - " it is a shitbox "😢
Que aburrida se a vuelto la fórmula 1, siempre ganan los mismos y no hay autos competitivos q le den pelea a RedBull. Si sigue así RedBull ganará el campeonato todos los años.
Can anyone explain to me why Tsuinoda's move over Zhou was penalized?
Verstappenn again boring
Ferrari horrible
"Thanks for your effort but we wouldn't be needing your services next year" hears Leclerc😅
Yuki has a bright future in being a reserve driver
Mercedes back on their form . Ferrari still struggled TT
Verstappen is going to completely forget how to drive with others around him at this rate XD
one ferrari finish p5, the other ferrari finish in p11. How bad is that Ferrari? I can see Charles struggling to drive.
Yuki's penatly has to be a joke
Every race, same thing, Verstappen 20 - 30 seconds ahead.
GOLDEN BOY WAS BORN IN BELGIUM
YUKI TUNODAのペナルティが 理解できますか? 僕には まったく理解できません。  YUKIは 素晴らしいドライバーに 育ちました。
If Max keep this winning streak going with win and fastest lap. How quickly can he become World Champion??? By witch race do we expect Max to get his 3th Championship????
Max verstapen is goat a in formula 1  sofar 🎉
Can I have those commentators for the german Sky broadcast please? Ours are horrible. Sorry, Ralph!
yuki mega race🎉 in 8th fastest car
30s gap even with merc upgrades is insane man in this car is unstoppable and as a rob fan since the vettel days I’m all for it
Seems like a lot of the drivers let Perez through with giving any fight, letting him catch up to the two Mercs ... i don't know but its a bit odd somehow 🤔
What happened to Alonso? :(
It could be podium for Perez but George kept up the pace
Such a boring race 🙄
Ferrari is stupidly slow
The race was terrible!  Give Crofty back!   Yuki didn't deserve that thing? It  was a hard racing.   F**k DRS!   But Formula 1 will censor this. That's why f**k Formula 1 and capitalism.
We want Crofty
Este narrador só narra berrando..que coisa mais chata!
2 stars for this race was pointless waking up for it really just like the FA cup yesterday we all know what would happen.
It seems to me that the FIA stewards are strongly discriminating against Japanese drivers. If that penalty was justified, all drivers would have been barred from racing by now.
Race results every week be like Max and everyone else. As soon as dude pulled away after the first turn, i knew the race was done
Rotten luck for Norris 😢
Max won! Insane, never though.
These Redbulls are on steroids.
Terrible decision to give Yuki a penalty for that
The front stretch: Literally the only place where passing is possible 😅
Congratulations Lewis Hamilton.
Yuki's penalty was wrong
ridiculous decision from maFIA
Yang menang max terus bosen
Lando falling down to the bottom after that starting line contact was really sad to see and Yuki getting that 5 sec penalty was a dumb call by stewards. Should have just been a racing incident.
Does the 23+ plus mean the gap between Max and Hamilton?
Why is ZHOU the only one who has his last name first on the leaderboard ?
The penalty for Tsunoda was ridiculous. He was penalised for racing CCP monkey fairly. Anyone who dares to touch CCP monkey will be penalised because China is on the raise and has money on people's mouths
YEEEEESSS...!!! WOOOOAA, LEWIS..!!🔥🔥🔥
How you managed to find 8 minutes of highlights in this race astounds me
Que pasa Ferrari 😡
Press F for Yuki
Strange Russell radio about the rain; if it was sweat he should have seen it in every corner en tell that it's raining hard. Just a low move to lure others into the pitt. Russell is getting stranger with every race.
Encore quelque chose d'intéressant... Ou pas....
F1 of late is reduced to close racing and action among midfield teams. The championship being decided, the fans are forced to find excitement in filler teams racing and off field liberty antics.
It is such a shame, Alpha Tauri  machine cannot keep up with other teams. Yuki was doing really well with it.
BORING
You know it's too easy for redbull and Verstappen when even they sound underwhelmed at winning.
Can someone help me understand why George didn't need to give position back starting of the race? Secondly, Ocon is just crazy...
Shocked you managed to get the highlights to 8mins. Most boring ace I’ve seen in my life
what's with the weird commentators?
What's wrong with Ferrari ?
+23 seconds between p1 and p2😴
Heartbreak for the Mclarens. Better luck in Canada
give us back Crofty
couldnt alonso get mediums instead of hards on the last pit?
Yawnmula One
Jend. Sam Ardi Bolkiah Abdurrahman, Guam( irian dar'es salam) country situs Ibrahim nabi.....
It feels like Alonso doesn't care and loves to just race anyway
Mclaren - One lap wonder on Saturday  Back to normal on Sunday
Anyone else catch the look on totos face when merc finished p2 p3
Mercedes found a lot of speed with that upgrade. Should be an interesting tustle with RedBull for the rest of the season potentially.
Who ever managed to make an 8min video is a genious...
Bien Checo!
Max's season set to cruise control. He's not even racing anymore, just managing tyres all race long.
WORLD CHAMP DRIVING LIKE A WORLD CHAMP. MAX VERSTAPPEN ❤
insane
05:17  Ocon still defending like a lion 😂😂😂
Alhamdulillah 😊😊😊🤲🏁🏁🏁 Go Mercedes Amg Petronas 🖤☝️ insyaallah amin 🥰😎
Oh look verstappen won again.....what a surprise
Yuki did not deserve that penalty
Any @FP1Will fans here?
One of the most boring races I’ve seen since france 2019
parece que mercedes ya despertó
For a moment imagine Max doesn’t exist. F1 gets extremely interesting that way  Checo leads the table. Hamilton & Fernando in the fight for the title.   The constructors fight between Red Bull, Aston & Mercs.   Feels awesome
how can this be enjoying, it’s 10 years that is not!! YOU HAVE TO CHANGE A LOT!!!!
Was this a grand slam for max?
.....It has to rain
F1 boring af
Yawn
Where is Martin brundle & David Croft??? Missing their commentary....
This has convinced me ferrari has a little better race pace than alpine,they just have better one lap pace making them start much higher
If Yuki’s penalty today was deserved then I’m Father Christmas. It was ridiculously harsh, might as well write it onto the rules that you must defer to anyone passing around the outside.
We have Formula Boring again? Is Verstappen the new Hamilton?
zzzzz pls make the races more entertaining
10 carros pontuando é muito chato. Saudades da época que só os 6 primeiros pontuavam. Até o 8° seria legal, mas metade do grid pontuando é chato.
Tsunoda didn't deseve that! What are they thinking? Boring race where no driver try to overtake each other? Bruhh..why are you even racing then ...just give the championship to Max and Red Bull .
Penalty standards are so vague that the stewards have significantly reduced the quality of F1.
J’étais là 😁
It's a horrible year for McLaren fans 😢
Não entendi essa penalidade do Yuki, nem chegaram a se tocar. FIA fazendo 💩💩💩💩😤🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Redbull celebration of Max win is more like a routine now... 😁 Could see that in their reaction..
The worst announcer ever. My 9 year old can do a better job.
Of course it's Hamilton who is involved in a race incident like that again. Did they forget the rear mirrors during the upgrade?
Norris going from 3 to 17 just gutted me so much He almost won back in 2020 but slips due to rain and now after a tough season he gad a chance to be podium or atleast top 5 but then hamilton just ruined it with his send. Its so sad
Alonso played the team game? So he sacrificed points and a run at 2nd to help rich kid Lance Stroll?
Just wished either Alonso or Sainz would've made it to the podium on their home race. 😢
23 seconds ahead of second place...smdh
When an entire sports REQUIRES bad weather to be fun there is something seriously wrong with it.
Can we just give max the championship and start a new series, I mean what are we doing here? He’s in a different universe.
fine day for Stroll on passing Alonso ✌🧡 ( finishing ahead )
Será que o Alonzo foi proibido de ultrapassar o Stroll, por alguma ordem de quem financia a equipe? 💰$
Russel did a great job today!
Is it possible to have a more boring race?
Max is really unstoppable because the gap between him and Lewis was 24 seconds. It is insane
This sport is boring.
I don't understand how Ferrari keeps those two tired pilots
Another walk in the park, just to easy, and it’s getting boring
Ferrari is really not competitive this season, 5th and 12th? Someone better go back to the drawing board
Who all agree to this: Yuki gets sympathy from everyone due to his stature.
Respect to Alonso for getting seventh place on this race! 🏁 🏎
Max and teem almost seem bored with their success
Hey 2021 F1 season, i miss you.
So max can do it everytime he's in a battle but yuki can't 🤔
xd tsunoda idiot
Since 2nd race is like Red Bull Championship TV with Max and 19 other drivers trying to figure out the cardboards they are driving, amazing
Again, this championship is becoming a transaction for verstappen the best driver with  the best car by far ,, at least the rest was entertaining..
Total pleasure to see toto humble and shown his place. And hamilton being very happy with 2d as he odnt deserve anything mee than 5th.
It's beginning the climb back up to the top.
So happy for mercs , i hope they can keep that pace and we can see Lewis and Max going wheel to wheel again this season. Perez was fast and could have been on podium if he had better tire management
What a boring race. I'll only watch a race if it rains from now on.
Aston Martin grabbed points and stroll got improvement but Alonso had bad race fr
Franz Tost is now eating his own words. He said stewards were fair.
Bro verstappen needs to take some time off racingg
ferrari cars are looking slow and heavy
5 second is too harsh tbh, i would have given just a give back position cuz he sent zhou wide when he was a little behind in corner entrance. 5 second is a yoke
Subtitles please!!!
THANK YOU SO MUCH for the race order summary at the end❤❤❤
Boring f1 died
The best part of this is the announcer screaming all the time and that's so annoying. What a lame race..... And lame officiating! F1 is no longer the pinnacle of motorsports racing......
Now we know that Rbish is unstoppable  merc also Ferrari Sainz*   The kings of adrian Newey
2.2s stop. It always amazes me
now even Lewis got brainwashed with this lgbt+ madness.
Ocon's mission to put Fernando in the Hospital continues. . .
Max Gk ada  lawan
Un campeonato cocinado en el garaje, un título de papel y un campeón de azúcar.
Dude Ferrari’s strategy never fails to disappoint me. Ferrari put hard tires and I’m like okay they will stay out there longer and move up when everyone does their own pit stops. Then I was expecting them to switch to soft/medium. Nope they change them out at 17 laps (all when the other drivers who had soft/medium did not even make their pit stops) and went to soft tires. I just gave up watching after that.
Ocon looking at his side mirror. Another cars Ocon: let them easy past. When Alonso gaining Ocon:Lion defend mode on!
Why doesn't Russell get a penalty?
Bon ben, il es clair que le championnat es plié pour Max. Sur ce circuit de référence, la messe es dites.......
F1 is so boring im suprised verstappen isnt bored tbh... every race out the front on your own, that cant be fun. Watch motogp instead, far better racing.
Interesting how LITTLE was said about Checo Perez's performance.  He was anywhere from 19th to 3rd place.  Every time he was set back, he managed to work his way up to the front.  Bravo Checko!!
The move where MAX pushes SAINZ out -> OK. OCON pushing ALONSO all the way to the pit exit -> OK. But TUNODA... NO. Why? Because he's Japanese. That's the stewards' mindset.
Another f1 yawn-a-thon. It was the race for second place again.  Crofty and Brundle can only do so much to try to make the parade interesting.
1:45 Announcer Makes Funny Noise
Max is a class apart
One man dominating F1 races.   Boring.
Even Max and RedBull sound bored by the end
Wow, starting on the mediums would have been so much better for everyone, especially when they were going for a one stopper and switch to hard tires. Master strategy Red Bull. 🙌🏽
LETS GO MAX!!!! ALL HAIL THE DUTCH LION!!!!
So where is Ocon's penalty?
Rain turn 4 russell😂
No wonder f1 is boring ppl get penalised 4 racing hard then we get casual boring overtakes
Welcome mercedez. Que se prepare redbull que por hay bienen toto y mercedez
1:22 No one point out that Lewis's car rear left rim cover been blown out since first lap?
Incredible race from Hamilton and Russell....
😴
BOOOOOOOORIIIIIINGGGGGG 💤💤💤
3:00 really? A papers width? You can see them touch. These commentators are absolutely terrible
Haas/Aston Martin Hypetrain reached final destination already??
Charles was on Hards and boxed on lab 20, Verstappen on mediums came in on 27
Please please please get rid of David Croft
Chin up yuki!! the chinese just got lucky. You can get revenge in Montreal 🔥
Great day for Mercedes !! Finally !! For MV it was business as usual…
Improved Merc so Max just put his foot down ;-)
Ocon still hating Alonso, I see.
yuki did not deserve a penalty, both zhou and him were doing amazing this race and that just ruined it
Ferrari?
Glad to see they fixed Yuki's brakes
I am wondering how people are watching F1 races this year ....F1 app doesn't work as intended i heard...
Nice drive Zhou! Point deserved
Thanks to Max and Red Bull. I don't care about them or race wins any more. This is a great season except for Red Bull. I've never paid so much attention to the rest of the field.
Paseo de Max 🥱
Max is only winning because he has the fastest car on the grid. Literally anyone will be winning if they had the same car...his not special. Perez is much better driver
No credits for Hamilton in the comments, it's clear now that he's overhated!!
This race showed that Mercedes overtook Aston Martin as the second fastest car
Verstappen's third Grand Slam. Outstanding performance from him and Red Bull.
Day 423 of searching for Verstappens personality
Move Verstappen to Haas, increase viewership.
Mercedes is on 🔥🔥🔥🔥

There were no walls for Stroll to hit so he did pretty well.
Boooooooring
Alonso : "Tell Esteban To Fight Like A Lion" (in 2021) Ocon : "I Will Fight Like A Lion (in 2023)
Well done,Max 👍  What a perfect grand slam 😯
Max wins? Who would of thought.
CONGRATULATIONS TO HONDA ENGINE...BOUNCE BACK CHEKO.
someone nerf redbull car its to op
Bring us highlights with Crofty back plz
Mercedes is Back ❤
7.16, great to see my fellow South African people in the stands enjoying a great race.
Who knew all Mercedes needed to succeed was the sidepod change? Makes you wonder why they forced that sidepodless design for almost one and a half seasons. Engineers definitely got canned for that one.
FIA strikes again this time yuki with a unnecessary penalty
in my sight , zhou leave the track just because if he still turn into the corner in that speed there will be an oversteer and his race will just gone, nothing is related with yuki
Marshalls: Babyploppers.🤣
I have a question If Max and Perez had switched positions, would Max have still won the race?
Stroll ahead of Alonso, truly an alternate universe.
How'd you manage 8 mins of highlights from that race
Boring af
Formula 1 is getting boring now. The same driver wins ever race and pretty much leads every lap. You could give all the drivers a 5 lap lead and Max Verstappen would still probably find a way to finish on the podium. My team Aston Martin, who I have been a fan before Fernando Alonso joined probably will not win a Grand Prix this year. They had their best chance in Monaco and they blew it. I could see them finishing 4th in the Constructers.
F1 is arbitrated by amateurs.
굳잡 맥스
Tsunoda is the driver of the race!! Unfortunately bad luck haunts him!!!
This could legit be a minute long. They start, Norris taps Hamilton, they go round and round for 66 laps, Verstappen wins.
Até o Highlights é chato.
What was the difference between Yuki's move on Zhou and Verstappens move on Sainz on lap 1? I don't see one. Sainz was ahead going into the corner as well, yes verstappen had the inside of the corner but Sainz is still entitled to track space you cant just let your brakes off and run wide forcing the other driver to slam on.... FIA need to cut down on his tactic of doing that to anyone who tries to overtake him.
Where’s the race commentary 👎
Shame that this is Alonso’s worst result of the season, and at his home race, but to have 7th be the worst is pretty incredible
Thank you Hamilton, thank you!
This series is washed 🥱
Max won again ,really , glad Hamelton   got second
Max is becoming stronger with that Strongest machine
FIA ”We race as one. But that doesn't include Japanese."
That was unfair for Tsunoda
What happened to Leclerc,  why was that early pit stop on hard tyres?
the difference of the energy between german and english commantators is hilarious
Alarming bells are ringing in Red Management about Perez 😮
I knew lando would bin it ever since yesterday's quali how everyone was going ga ga over him. He is yet to mature as a driver.😂
they aught to introduce 1 place penalties for situations like today.
Everyone focusing on Yuki. Meanwhile Ocon almost ruining Alonsos race.
All those Salty Brits with their "this year is so boring" blablablaaaa what about 2014-2020? All mercedes constructor+driver championships. We all had a blast back then didnt we? They made it like this, they should have done a better job with their zero sidepod. And now they have to copy RB 😂
Max first corner was to hit Carlos front wing?
Boring
😒
How they made 8 minutes of highlights I really dont know
1:34 comment of the season, he decided to speak facts
This is so boring to watch.... Different races same results
felt like the track only consisted of the start finish straight and the following corner. little bit of a monotone video
Porque No solo corren solo los Red Bulls,ya hasta que aburren siempre los mismos.
2.2 seconds pitstop..Redbull team is just too OP..meanwhile if u ask Ferrari what went wrong they have no clue...why they are so bad
what is this commentary? where is crofty?
Nadie, los mexicanos: le robaron a Perez 😅
Anyone wanting Max's and Red bulls dominance to be challenged? Just send over Ferrari strategists. Sit back and relax.
That tsunoda penalty was absolute bs
Where's the other commentator? The old one. (I'm new to F1)
better then street circuit..enough space for overtaking,.far away from the wall..
Can we just give the trophy to Mac already? Even if he finishes 5th in every race to the end of the year, he still wins.
Why is McLarens livery different?
<3
The Merc's went well. James Allison back at the helm is improving things.
There is 23sek gap max to merc... this is big...
Give Max slowest bolid, and he will find way to win. What a beast
mercedes is back, still behind 22 seconds, hopefully alonso gets a win this season
Finally Hamilton🎉🎉
Driver of the day Sergio or perez
Hamilton masterclass
Max' voice sounds like he is drowsy after the end. Even he was getting sleepy leading so easily.
What highlights? You know the racing is bad when they’re constantly showing battles for p15 during the race… another boring race.
Qmqknnzna
1:24 what happened to Hamilton's rear left, it seems to not have a hub cap on it?
Highlights? Slight tussle in the first corner, and that was that
Everyone that says Yuki didn't deserve the penalty, you clearly don't know F1 rules.
Max in a spaceship 24 sec lead to the second. Seems totally normal and 'fair'.
Fernandslow Alonslow.
あれで角田にペナルティ？裁定下したヤツの目は節穴か！笑
Hey Alonso, just once don't make Stroll look bad. Job done. Now back to real racing next week.
Get Lewis a fast car and he will deliver
most fun race to watch imo
As a Leclerc fan…I found it strange that Xavier pitted him twice each time he got in front of Carlos.  Leclerc had new Soft tires left over.  There was no reason to use Hard tires on Leclerc, twice.  Especially after everyone heard the RB was sliding on C1 Hard tires.  Basically, the strategy on Leclerc was botched on tire selection.  EDIT -  Mercedes did not race the C1 Hard tire.
F1 is becoming boring. Another lazy race win for Verstappen. Let me know when other teams actually become competitive again.
This is the most boring year in all F1 history!
Subtitle: some random overtaking situations at the end of main straight and in the end Verstappen wins
I’d like to hear the haters who complained so much about Mercedes & Hamilton winning to much. Bunch of hypocrites.
I.hate.Hamilton.and.Russell.Happy.days.Max.I.love.you.❤
Ocon deserved punishment, and Tsunoda doesn't. If was a car coming out of pit and colide with Alonso's car?
Again again max,  👎🏽
I just wish well be seeing an actual battle for the title next season.
Is it serious that the russell move didn't get penalized? What a joke.
anybody else have "this video is unavailable"?
Ferrari is like a turtle...so shame 😢
こんな判定されるならF1見たくない！ 角田応援してます頑張って
Wow! This season is as tedious as the last one
Strong race from Perez
Yawn. It is ridiculous. No competitive cars in F1.
Wereld kampioen nr3 zeker weten
I smell a 3rd championship victory for Verstappen this season , no doubt he’s too quick
What i dnt understand whts happening with ferrari its like every year they are getting slow every time instead of fighting they are jst loosing
George Rusell "raining" was hilarious 😂
Can't get the feels without Krofty's voice.
なぜ角田選手がペナルティをくったのか？ 明確な説明をFIAはするべきだ。 チャイナマネーと揶揄されないためにも
What’s up with Max and constantly saying ‘lovely’. Has his PR asked him to say everything is lovely, every time.
So if Sainz went out of the track at the first turn instead of breaking and back out Max should get a penalty,thats at least how Tsunoda got a penalty. Rules are different for everyone I guess.
Mr. Alonso..you are almost...vs Gutierrez 2016....
we want crofty
Povera  FERRARI    È  RIMASTO  SOLO IL  COLORE   ROSSO.
I.love.Love.Love.Max.Hate Hamilton
this only needs to be 2mins long....lol. boring race
Yuki penalty....wierd
Maybe Bernie’s idea of having sprinklers to make the races more exciting wasn’t such a bad idea after all.
why are the williams always last
If you ignore Max breezing to another easy win, that was probably the most entertaining race of the season.
Another boring race.....
Why is no one talking about check scrapping a p4 finish?? F1 fans are blind sometimes
This is pretty pedestrian racing. There is no point in watching after lap one really.
Boooring
No DNFs
Max just sounds bored, not even his teammate can challenge him.
Snooze fest
People that are saying that the race is boring are just copping at the fact that Max is dominating, something that F1 fans hate the most for some reason
You can hear how even the commentators are bored of redbulls overtaking
Can we have Crofty back to comentary
F1 will go under. We don’t want those generation, we don’t want this lifeless boring races. We want v8s we want action, we want racing. In 5-10 years f1 will go have lost 70% of its viewership
Great to see Merc back on the podium, still a long way away from RB though
Red bull rocketship
That penalty for tsunoda was so not right... zhou had a cars with of room on the outside
何度見ても　何故あれがPenalty❓
Great drive by hamilton and russel, and actually sainz did amazing as well - was one of the best spanish gp's in a while
Wow we got full house!!
The penalty for Tsunoda is complete harassment.
George is driver of the day for sure !
Once again Max won the Race, unexpected!
boring
how is that ocon no pernalty but yuki did
Boooreeeed
Dear Haters,  Get ready to see Hamiliton again on Podium🐐😈
24 sec gap to Max, yeh Mercs got a lot of work cut out for em if they wana contend with the Raging Bulls. Says Sir L.
Zhou was just ahead in the apex and if he didn’t take the escape route both Yuki and Zhou would have crashed so the penalty was deserved
Wait at 4:37 the stroll and alonso’s names are the wrong way round
Bring back martin brundle & david croft for commentator😢
I thought Maldonado won in 2012,it wasn't Spain?
They never mentioned Leclerc the whole race. Quietly underperformed in 11th.
nothing special to watch. I got bored
Ferrari payah,, 2 musim gak ada peningkatan. Hadehhh, semenjak terakhir musim Schumacher Ferrari menjadi pencundang. Mau bersaing dengan Mercedes gak bisa, Red Bulls naik eh perfomance Ferrari menjadi semakin payah... Mercedes melemah red Bulls lagi dipucuk. Mah Ferrari masih saja menjadi yang ketiga,,
When you see the battles between Ham and Ver over the last couple years no penalties and Tsunoda get’s one there, what a joke
Alonso: You have to leave the space! 5:18
From now on, when it comes to battle, let's swell on the out side and say "I was pushed out!" You can rank up easily. In addition, the mad stewards will give the opponent up to penalty points.
Red Bull🇦🇹HONDA🇯🇵🗾今季７勝目本当におめでとう❗️マックス・フェルスタッペン🇳🇱今季５勝目おめでとう❗️角田裕毅🇯🇵がんばれ❗️次戦カナダGP🇨🇦も優勝を期待しています❗️ホンダ🇯🇵🗾がんばれ
Race “highlights” is a stretch
that Yuki pentalty shows you that the FIA have no clue what they're doing, never have been ever since Abu Dhabi regardless of who's incharge.
This is not race so boring
So boring max winning every time. But more power to him
bruh where tf is crofty man -_-
Why do they even call this racing? ITS NOT. Same person wins every time. So freaking boring. Oh because the cars don't have equal performance. That seems really fair.
How could you make 8 minutes of highlights from this race?
5:24 move of the race ngl
The mercs are back
Bored F1... ZzzZzzzZ
"Everyone has a target in zheir backs"  - Darth Toto
So the Aston Martin run is over?
Boring
I’m sure there are many that really enjoyed this race, I’m not one of them. No matter how many times the commentators say it’s great, I don’t see it. I know the hater’s will chime in, just my opinion.
Red Bull es invencible.
Always one team winning...over rated sport
Ocon forgot that Alonso is no longer his teammate. Classic Ocon. 😒
At least Stroll got some consolation by ending ahead of Alonso.
Why does Ocon feel the need to pull those wild moves on Alonso only?
2 and 3 mercedes yeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssss
Mercedes 2-3? What the f...!? 😑
I feel bad for McLaren and Lando. They finally qualify P3 but he’s last at the end of the first lap.     More McLaren fan pain.
Ocon is a danger to everyone.
Snooze fest
Unreal race from George
Today we saw differences in management and drivers:  Leclerc asking for softs, team responds with hards, Leclerc says no, I want soft. He pits and gets hards.  Verstappen asks about the fastest lap after getting 3 warnings about track limits. GP says to not think about it and drive between the white lines. Verstappen himself puts the throttle, gets fastest lap and GP says: okay Max, now please stay within the white lines.  One driver has the status and confidence to determine race strategy himself. Other driver and team are not in sync anymore or don’t trust each others judgement.   Sainz and Leclerc are mentally destroyed by Ferrari and it is painful to see
Lol max is getting bored already you can just tell, dude will be in WEC or something else in a couple years he’s already proven himself
Sad to see 😔 Ferrari not getting better result this year looks like they will finished 4th in constructor and in driver mid table May be or lower too  Do something as other teams upgrade showing some positive sign Rather than negative  No speed no reliability what they did in constructing this car I thought it ll be more challenging this year but now lost all hopes
Another snore-fest, I have to watch at night in bed to replace Ambien 💤
Yet another boring....
Such an amateur drive Lando!
I lost 90 minutes of my life watching this live
F1.✨🏆✨🏁💙🏁😁👏👍🏻
Stop with drs. To easy to past
Ridiculous penalty for Yuki
40 and counting 🎉
my only wish is that I don't pay for a full bundle of entertainment, news, or whatever bull&*@# just to have one channel (f1) with bad commentary.. people who get f1 tv access you lot are freaking lucky
Red Circus never disappoints <3
FIAの一貫性の無い裁定にはほとほと愛想が尽きた。 日本人に差別的な裁定をするという意味では一貫性があるのかも知れないが、こんなんじゃ競技として成立していないのでもう見ないよ。
Only highlight of this race was the rain inside George's helmet
Otra carrera aburrida , ni ganas de verla
Even the highlights are boring 🙄
SUPER MAX!
Leclerc unable to get in to the top 10 and sainz goes from the the front row to P5........ ferrari what are you guys doing ?
Yuki's penalty only seems weird untill you realize that the turn bends back in, so Zhou was ending up off track no matter what. Him backing off to take the escape road was the right choice to avoid damaging the car.  There really wasn't space and it feels like people forget these guys are driving boats.
Where is the Spanish clown?😂
GRAND SLAM!!!!!!!! WOOHOO 🎉🥳
So bored of Max winning by huge margins. Without him the rest of the grid is so competitive.
Otro triunfo para su papito k nunca gano nada en los 80..
Mercedes is coming
Ocon’s dangerous move : no penalty Russell's gains from off-course : no penalty Tsunoda’s defense : penalty and penalty point  Nice to see the same trend as last year.  I love “Race” incident.
Muy triste lo de Ferrari
Japanese people want fair sport
Que amargo que sos max
Ocon always defend like a lion if he's againts alonso😂😂
Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya Without Chicane + Without DNF a.k.a. A Full-House Race = Numero Uno. 🎉🏎🏁🇪🇸👏  04/06/2023 23:12.
Max champion for the 3rd time in arow
Checo es bueno  Pero Max es mejor
That Ocon late move should be penalized. So dangerous.
Nice to see Hamilton, George on podium
Max is already Champion
Como seria bom se a mercedes nao tivesse insistido tanto no conceito zeropods
so mercedes is somewhat back but still not red bull quality
Ocon should be disqualified for that move on Alonso
Nimejisika furaha kuona lewis akirudi ndani ya podium 💪💪🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿
You know race was boring when Monaco was more entertaining...
Well I want to see a fight for 1st place but then Verstappen already so far away and it's boring guys Formula 1 boring again sigh
Tsunoda was robbed. Someone hire better stewards for the next F1 race
Lewis did amazing job
Watched it live, but am still here watching the highlight
Boring F1.  The FIA should permite that last teams have much time to work and permite each team choose a race to work all year. Who agree give a like 👍
Mercedes looking like they've figured a few bits out and are really quick! Still a mile behind RB though who are many miles ahead of most the paddock... RB will make it boring and turn people away if this continues for too long. The rules were designed to prevent another Mercedes situation like the last era but the only teams to have smashed the rule changes are the two cheaters (RB & AM)! Maybe more severe punishment was needed
F 1 now is too boring.. verstappen is very dominated.. formula e must be excitement..
Ma per favore la gara piu noiosa d8 sempre, che fine ha fatto lo spettacolo?  Ma chi vogliono fregare sta Liberty. ?  Da due anni zero hype.
Thanks won't need the Channel 4 highlights now
YUKI ROBBED.
Sad, sad race by Sainz
Can't believe there was overtakes in the used to be boring Spanish gp! Whoever came up with those changes is a legend. F1 please bring back Portimao race track
Look like the upgrade is working for mercedes but in this restricted real upgrade era…look like red bull gonna be dominating with that honda engine and merc will stay 2nd atleast till the rest of the freeze…the only way for Lewis to get the 8th is by joining Red Bull LOL…and only if he can counter Max agressive style without crashing LOL
Ill believe if the Merc upgrade worked if they do what they've just done in Spain 2 or 3 more times up the road.
Sad for Ferrari drivers
角田より オコンの方が悪質だと思う
Perez is not worthy of a Redbull ride
Yuki deserved better. DotD at least.
I miss Goatifi
Close F1 and make a new one, a serious one, please. This silly sport is over.
24 sec…. Jesus
May be move of the year so far in F1..... Fernando u beauty
Snooze fest on this one
Ferrari is now competing with midfield teams. Shame
Every single clip is just a Drs overtake down into turn 1... how boring
boring one horse race
Lamentablemente la escudería más importante de la fórmula 1 o sea Ferrari 🇮🇹 es una sombra de lo que fue en su desempeño el año pasado en la actualidad no tiene rendimiento alguno y no hay signo de mejoría
Mercedes😍
The 5 sec penalty for tsunoda is a disgrace He left him room
24S but racing was going to be closer sure
Sainz just pathetic!
Am I the only one who thinks this commentary just isnt it?
I think that Yuki deserved his penalty, that would've ended very badly for him and Zhou if they made contact, very dangerous. No offense for him tho, he's shown class performances so far this season and i'm sure he'll do even better in the upcoming races.
A better showing for Mercedes but they have a long, long way to go to catch up to Mad Max! He's completely dominating and so is his car. Er, kinda like Hamilton used to do. Funny... no one is saying Max isn't the best driver, it's his car, the way they did Hamilton for years...🤔🤔🤔
Verstappen did the same to Sainz what Yuki did to Zhou, and he gets a 5 sec penalty?
Abbiamo sputtanato Binotto dopo che è arrivato secondo e fatto anche qualche vittoria.Quest'anno arriveremo sesti se va bene e tutti zitti sono mortificato x il della FERRARI.......
Before all the glory chasing max fans come after me, theres no way redbull havent overspent again with how fast the car is compared to every other car on the track
FIA must stop discriminating against Japanese.
Max is not racing. He is just doing formation laps
Yuki's did not deserve the penalty Ferrari just a memory surviving upon the glory acquired during a past life.
Most people don’t understand overtaking and start complaining about FIA decisions. Yuki was definitely forcing Zhou off the track when clearly Zhou was half a car length ahead into the turn, great decision by FIA.
Boring race
Why I Watched This?
Getting rid off that Mickey mouse chicane has improved the racing.
Is no one going to talk about the 24 second difference from 1st - 2nd 😂😂
Perez and Leclerc need a serious talking to.  Leclerc is massively under performing in the Ferrari and there is absolutely no excuse for Perez, that red bull should be on the podium every race.
🎉
Waiting for conor moore with his russel rain/sweat reaction
In my opinion, this race was worse than Monaco.
Probably be the norm every other race this year, the RB car’s winning by 20-30 seconds. how boring when one team has much faster cars then the rest of the field. put any other driver on the grid in that car they would win sorry max fans it ain’t the driver it’s who’s got the fastest car 😂 ✌🏼
LOL NOrris.. i love watching this guy fall everytime.
Absolute snoozefest of a race
We know the who is the winner. Another boring season.
I miss 2021 rivalry between max and lewis
👍👍
Boring race yet again😅
De nuevo checo haciendo un carreron después del sabotaje de su equipo
Come on Mrec Kick the Fake Champ off the top spot
boring
YES MAX YES
Boring....another win to Red Bull...
It's a track, not a road.
It's sad to see that the Haas Team is so much faster in the qualifying than in the race.
Has Red Bull won the constructors yet?
did ferrarri overtake anyone...
Once more a thrilling race with a countless amount of highlights – I definitely not considered to unsubscribe my F1TV membership. 🫣
End of Ferrari era's
Max won ZZZZZZZ
Get in there Lewisss
Boring race
Against racism and hate from the leader of red bull team, who gave the worst car to Perez, he finished 4th.   In the Max Car, Perez shurely be 1th.     Perez must go out of the redbull to be champion
あれで角田に5秒ペナルティは無いだろ！！！ おかしいだろ！ どうなってんだよ！
atrapa Max
Ohh Ferrariii 🙄🫣
Fun fact: F1 used to have this thing called a Safety Car and the cars sometimes would NOT finish the race
I miss "Lights out and away we go"
Ah yes, the old "i can get 2 10- second penalties and still win the race" victory for red bull  F1 is working as intended
FIA wanted the French or a Monacan to take the points
Ferrari tá muito mal 😢
Tsunoda got robbed for a clean defense move.. :(
Why would they PIT Charles who was on hards so much earlier than Verstappen
Tsunoda got a penalty for defending his position? F1 is getting so lame...
someone in the commentatory box said verstaton
Yuki robbed
FIAってアジア人差別ひどくないですかねぇ？ 角田があれで5秒ペナルティを喰らうのだったら、オコンは同等もしくは10秒ペナルティを喰らうべきだと思うのですが……
When Red Bull wins the 2023 Driver's and Constructor's championship, they'll need to thank Ferrari's strategist.
I hope Lewis does it this year he's a true winner and great example to the younger generation 🇬🇧
Start calling it ,Max Racing!
Very Boring race. Zzzzzzzzzzz
Mercedes crying in the comment section as usual
DRS = duck race sitting
F1 is so boring now
I prefer David Croft as commentator, there is no emotion with this guy
Max got another grand slam 😂
You are sooooo disappointing HAAS. 😡😡
Sorry Yuki took penalty for forcing another driver out of the track but at the start max overcooked his breaks and you can see that by how wide he get, the one is penalty the other not, both of these arent for penalty
角田に対するペナルティが厳し過ぎる。
Ocon just can’t compete against Alonso 😂💯
Ferrari is a Joke this year!
A great race for mercedes
Yuki Tsunoda P9 in my book
yuki must be P9
あの程度で角田にペナルティを出す位なら、FIAはF1をタイムアタックで競わすべき！
FIA so crrupted.
Nice race, but it feels like even Max thinks races are growing duller 😴
Disaster going on for Ferrari 👇
Justice for Yuki
オコンが悪いわけじゃないけどオコンにペナルティ出さずにそれはないわ。一貫性がない
Can´t they just give Max the trophy and send him home so the rest of us can get some "more" exciting races?  😀  On a related but more serious note, I would love to see what Max would be able to achieve in a Haas or any other of those cars in the rear, but I guess that´s just wishful thinking
I hope verstappen dominations doesn't become like Hamilton's own. This will Create unnecessary hate for verstappen and some boring seasons
What happens with Ferrari... are they sleeping
I hope AT can appeal. That penalty fo Yuki was so harsh.
Now I understand why Guenther was complaining about the stewards. Just look at Tsunods’s penalty🤦🏽‍♂️
NOTGONNASTAPPEN
Even in profile pic Max looks bored 😂😂
all of the race highlights at turn 1-3 only😅
Don't like the commentator
角田選手に対しての判定おかしいのではないでしょうか？これではこれからはコーナーでのバトルするなと言ってるようなものです。判定の一貫性がないのは辞めてほしいですね。
FIA stewards are less consistent than Ferrari strategists this season
why this commentator? ....
Merce back to the track
At this point in time, I'm just pretending like Max Verstappen doesn't exist [he's basically in a dimension by himself], and P2 is the new P1, otherwise these races would be insufferably boring to watch.
typical boring and almost scripted results i have seen more entertainments from the video game
the only think they notice is the LIGHT WORK of something like say something else
Vers unstopable
I love how EVERY single turn, Max pulls further and further away. This dudes lines are GODLY! UNTOOOUCHABLE!
This video could have been 30 seconds.
Ferrari Is out...
I missed Crofty
You know a race was boring when the highlights go up this fast
Does the FIA have something against the Japanese?
Yuki was supposed to do what?  Pull over to the side?  What about Ocon?!?
So glad for Mercedes!!!! Finally guys from the factory provided with great upgrades, it's seem upgrades are working!!!!  Go forward silver arrows!!!! Ham, we are all waiting for 8th!!!!!
Highlights ??  🤣🤣 Barcelona ist every year a boring Race. I dont know why they race there..
George: Guys there are raindrops inside my helmet.  Radio: Its your sweat  George: *visible confusion*
If Yuki got a penalty for that, Esteban should've got one for the bullwhip of a move he pulled on Fernando on the main straight!
Mercedes are back? All Mercedes needs is their DAS back
Ocon still holding beef against Alonso. Guy needs to be reprimanded.
ferarri where are you😢
Most boring sport in the world 😴😴😴
Imagine if Mercedes had gone with the right concept from the start of the new regulations. We might even have had more Max /Lewis title battles.
Ma come è possibile che già dal primo giro Verstappen prenda subito 50 metri di vantaggio e non si riesce più a recuperare??!!
Jeez another win for redbull, of course there's plenty of races left but man this just ridiculous especially once you think when is the last time ferrari won a race, and wasnt these regulations was suppose to improve more wheel to wheel racing. Had so many hopes that ferrari would exactly learn and develop and execute properly this year but no they changed team principals to try and improve from that success only for it backfire on themselves. Glad i got to experience the 2021 season through start to finish though.
Ah yes another snoozefest
ESTEBAN MOJON
The Max Verstappen’s Show and friends.
F1 is getting more and more boring. We need more competition, more racing, more passing, more equal cars. Any driver should be able to compete for the podium in may car on any race weekend. Period. Until then it’s just a few years of dominance by one team followed by a few years of dominance of another team. And this is suppose to be the “pinnacle of racing sport”………. Really????
Mercedes have jumped forward but have not yet really tuned up this B-spec. Can we hope for real competition with Red Bull in 3 or 4 races?
Ocon is a dangerous driver and should be banned from the grid
At this point I feel like Ferrari  changed their car just so people don't say they didn't try. Leclerc 12 from 19, and Carlos 5th from 3rd?
Even the highlights are getting boring. Verstappen-Redbull has just won the 2023.
I thought the whole point of the new regulations was to make for closer racing, not just DRS allowing the drivers to overtake, back to being an absolute BORE FEST!, this "highlights" was just the main straight and all DRS overtakes.
Lando being Lando😂. If he wasn't British they wouldn't give him so many chances
Perez man...
There's new FIA division called Formula Max.
Ferrari with upgrades worst ever
Another race without Crofty's commentary 😢
Poor yuki 😢
Fantastic race for positions 9-14, gg
RB and Verstappen sound bored :)
quite boring race , not much drama queen moments. Im here for adrenaline, drama, gossip and chaos lol
Zhou backed out himself, there's still space. The penalty on Yuki was strange.
i think verstappen is not happy that he has no challanger in that car definitivly the FIA gonna change some rules again for the Car so others can compete with each other it should be about driver skills and Team desicions in F1 not about only the car.
What happened to Crofty?
I love how mercs copy rb and go fast all of a sudden, now it's a competition. with the rb design on mercs we will see an rb mercs hopefully from the future race💯👍
Russell   moves  from 12  to 3, yet they give   driver of the day to braids.
Hamilton schooling Russell 😁
I guess Alonso would be better  steward than the current one.
Formula one has became very very boring....wow wow wow...i miss u senna...shumacher...berger...alesi...mika...villeneuve...hill...montoya...please remove the name to something else....tjats not f1
RUSSEL Lap 28: _“Rain at turn 5.”_ RUSSEL Lap 32: _“...I think it’s sweat from the inside of my helmet.”_ Yep, it’s raining only inside his helmet. 😄
Zzzzz…Boring.
who r the commentators
boring season
Boring
even the cameras couldn't catch up with max
Great return to form by Mercedes. I'm not a rabid Mercedes fan but the skill to keep at it and keep improving is appreciated. Well done Team. This may be Mercedes year for the Constructors Championship instead of Red Bull's.
Exelente resumen ...
Where is the place to vote Yuki's P9??
Really appreciate the summary by the commentator at the end of the video
what a snoozefest,... again. I'm spanish but the spanish GP is boring AF
I wouldn't mind if the person winning wasn't a fraud and had to have his fislrst 2 wdc HANDED to him
Thank you Mercedes for finally made sidepods
...Mercedes remain in the factory' we're coming 4da bulls...✌😎
Boring as always
Warwick has always hated the Japanese, so it's no wonder.
Boring
About time we had a better race, apart from verboring.
Yawn
The stewards seriously needs to get penalties for penalising Yuki.  That was extremely poor judgement from the stewards… they need to have some repercussion back to them for making mistake like this.
Let's just appreciate Perez's drive🔥
We were hopeful for Perez. He's made some errors in the last few races whilst Max has shown his brilliance. Behind the scenes Is the development going into Max's car or is Checo just feeling the pressure?
F2 highlights??
Max👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😂
5sec penalty forYuki? It's something Joke? Justice for Yuki!
How did Yuki "pushed" off Zhou? Thats a BS penalty
Honda BABY❗️👊🏾👍🏾🔥😎
That contact ruined lando's day. He could have finished p5-6 realistically
Hamilton is still the best driver of the bunch. Red bull has the fastest car at the moment. Not taking away from verstapan, great driver. But put them both in a red bull and Hamilton comes out on top any day
Bring back the sky sports commentators
Merc upgrade paid of 2nd and 3rd for them
TSU P9!!!

..boring
barcelona should be dropped asap. What a snooze fest
max "lovely" verstappen
at this point max literally has nothing to say anymore at the end of a race
Am I the only person that hates Masi & redbull😹..
Congratulations to Max. His pace is unmatched.  Lewis and Russell did a great job. I hope they come with more pace in the next race.
The cry keeps going about who makes who champion: both need eachother (strong car,team/strong driver) but in the end a great talented driver will make the difference and that difference will build up in years and the drivers career. And that will always be the same in F1.
Russell makes me laugh 😂😂
Lance at the point where Fernando have to gift him points... 🤨
Will we ever see Hamilton take the first position now?
yuki was so unlucky😢
Another BORING red bull win..
Too bad Verstappen doesn’t have an engaging personality. F1 is so boring with him 🥱
Yuki shouldn't have been given the penalty, the replay in the video clearly shows Zhou quite literally backing off and then crying about getting pushed off
sad alonso noises
The Worst race stewards forever💢💢💢
Che noia! Buongiorno.
We need to get rid of the FIA and bring back racing
Gracias 👋👋👋👋
Sooooonproud of Zhou! Thx Valtteri!
What happened to Alonso... Could he have grabbed a podium??
A Grandslam for the future GOAT 🔥
This guys commentary is so weak. Where tf is Martin
Congrats Maxy!
bruh where are the original commentators, I like them way more
Congratulations to Max. His pace is unmatched.  Lewis and Russell did a great job. I hope they come with more pace in the next race.
Mercedes: went from practically hanging in midfield last year to 360° upgrade package, improved to runners up challenger Ferrari: continues dropping from title challenger from last year to 360° upgrade package, continue falling down to backmarkers position🙈
Yuki getting penalty for that meanwhile Redbull don’t get even a mention for a incidents similar
Yes it was just another very boring race. There l’ve said it. Those who missed the race no worries you didn’t miss anything.
Mercedes assisted by FIA
This race just shows Mercedes is the 2nd quickest car and Alonso just outperforms his Aston.
I wish I saw Alonso n Sainz on the podium on their home soil... 😢
It sounds like Max, and Red Bull themselves are just going through the motions with these wins. It's getting boring for them.
Yes! Ferrari 😂😂
Change Commentary Voice
This was probably the most boring race so far this season.
mana nih kok tidak tersedia😢
You can give a penalty to your opponent if you rush in halfway and go out of the course yourself and say that you were pushed out.  This is the easiest overtaking.
How is this video 8 minutes long? I thought that the new changes brought to car designs back in 2022 were supposed to make racing more exciting? It has gotten more boring, and I'm not including Max's dominance, because there's always a dominant team/driver. F1 as a whole is not fun to watch, and that saddens me.
Hi❤❤❤❤😂
F1 needs latifi back, redbull have been unstoppabull since he left
マックスの仕上がり次元が違かったな今回は😂
Boring
Press L for the Spanish drivers
Max pake pesugihan
F1 sunday ritual, watch the race-in 10 laps struggling to stay awake-lap 20 already sleeping-open my eyes verstappen team radio "Well done max p1 mate"
You know it was a bad race when everyone is talking about Yuki's penalty
I just saw the 1st lap Russell was 9th/10th (cars are side by side so cannot say) before he went off track. Rejoined the track in 9th place, overtook Hulkenberg on track get 8th , then Norris pitted to put Russell in 7th
So boring ... 8min resume is too much ...
Verstappen's fantastic race!
Most boring race of the year by far
YUKI's penalty was unbelievable miss judge of F1 stuwards!
Win number 40 one behind Senna, Verstappen is on fire in this current generation
周がビビって自分から飛び出しただけやんけ抗議するならもっと並んでコースに残ってた上でしなよ
Didn´t think this race would and could be more boring than a typical Monaco race.
23 seconds later mercedes 2nd place
lewis is the goat
Respect to the man that stretched this highlights Video to 8 minutes.
Lol verstappen sounds bored
Yuki robbery
I don't wana hear nothing about Checo doesn't fit with RedBull because of Max podium finishes overshadowing the performance he puts in every time! Read that again! ❤Checo 🇲🇽
Crofty and brundle >>>
Impressive performance by Mercedes, they got the 2nd best outcome you could hope for in a race, really thought Perez would make P2/P3. Feel really sorry for Alonso though
Calculated by Alonso to let Stroll have the points. Call it charity for the sake of keeping the boss happy.
Yuki 5 sec penalty and 1 penalty point? For racing? Okay. F1 is now just a car parade.
9th is not Zhou.9th is Yuki!!
Amazing to see the highlights being published within an hour of the race end. Kudos to the team behind it. Well done guys!!
The midfield battle is so fascinating to watch, if you’re tired of watching max dominate just pay closer attention to what goes on from p14-p8 ish ;)
Whats the next race?
I feel bad for Tsunoda getting that penalty. Personally, I think it's unfair.
Verstapen está em outra categoria de piloto de F1 , ninguém compete com ele mas ! Ele vê os outros carros longe do seu retrovisor o super Max.
Penalty for Yuki is way too harsh.  Zhou simply ran out of room, it was not his corner at all.
YEEEES Mercedes, about time!!!!!!
Yuki  mega race.
Btw where is chuck lekrek ?
guys, claim about yuki!!　wth
Max won by 25 seconds, Not sure he was even trying.
Lol, you can hear how Redbull isnt even that excited about winning anymore. Verstappen was doing engine preservation from lap 1.
Iam happy little bit about my team got 2&3 with that  tank 🥲
A wire-to-wire win for Max. The rest of the field was jockeying for second place.
5 sec penalty on Yuki is too harsh.
Chinese money
Mercedes is heavy
BORING ….. Zzzzzz
Get In There Lewis 🏎💯💯
This is frustrating or sad when you're not a fan of a specific driver and want to see at least two or three drivers fighting for the win, there was some action in the back of the field though.
Tsunoda should've been told to give back the position instead of a penalty. Too harsh
why
Ferrari a disgrace...sack the entire team. Except the drivers
Race was ok, atleast more overtakes cause the Chicane is gone :)
Yet another LOVELY mega race
WHY did Tsunoda get a penalty 5 second,
Zhou literally said "He drove into me" on 4th June
How did Stroll bear his teammate Lord Fernando?? 😮
Digan lo que digan le están proveyendo a Max verstappen el auto mejor de la escudería , también le están proveyendo un apoyo y estrategia la cual lo haga seguir reteniendo el número veo que a Sergio Pérez le han retirado un poco después de El error de eso que le habían proveído para que pudiera pelear contra max, casi pareciera que estaba condicionado al mínimo error fuera culpa de él o de las circunstancias se le retiraría ese apoyo y eso es evidente, en el formato en el que se está compitiendo deberían reconocer que ya depende un 50 - 1 del auto y el piloto pone el otro 49%, Sergio Pérez sabe cosas que no puede decir públicamente.
00:52  Interesting
Yo no quiero a Hamilton en la fórmula uno está arruinando la carrera de casi todos en todos los premios siempre lo mismo con este tipo que pasa y ni siquiera lo penalizan
よく分かりましたよ。 角田だけ別のルール適用されてるんですね。さすがMAFIAだよ。
Still don’t know why you use this Commentary instead of Crofty
wow. what a boring replay? can’t imagine the race entire…
T 0:09 That opening 20 seconds of the start …  The Camera footage was incredible. Continuous - no cuts  Amazing
Ocon hated by most with a reason
If Yuki was given a 5 second time penalty for that incident then Ocon deserved 10 seconds for that move on Alonso
Lando goes from Hero to Zero
it was a terrible race for lando : (
5:43 is the devils favourite f1 lap
So you can use escape route to overtake 5 drivers and don't get Penalty. They said, Mercedes is back. But Come on. It's Major Upgrade with high bugdet cap while Ferrari and Aston Martin still Minor Upgrade. And what's result? More than 20 second behind Max. Still waiting. How did Ferrari and Aston Martin with their Major Upgrade?
So the Georpedo causes a stupidly dangerous crash, takes a shortcut to avoid carnage of the starting field and the Yuki gets a penalty for that   Laughable absolutely laughable this.
Can these commentators pls whisper so we can hear the cars 🤦‍♂️
角田へのペナルティは信じられないミスジャッジ💢
Thank you @F1 Media-Team for providing us always so quick a summary of the whole race
Little bit of boring race .   But still estaban tried to defend like a lion ...😅
😴
FIA ​​destroyed Yuki's race. The lead of F1 is the drivers, not the steward.
FIA stole Yuki’s brilliant race but never steal his bright future.
REST IN PIECES for Ferrari ...
Yuki keeps this up he’s at red bull soon
Zhou seems to have learned something from Neymar Jr.
Decent race. Lewis has to be the luckiest guy out there. How that tire didn’t go flat after contact with Lando is insane. Great result for Mb and F1 as a whole.
Honda verstappen ❤❤❤❤❤
That’s Yuki’s corner and he leaves enough space for Zhou to make the turn!
How is he 23 seconds ahead , his car is much quicker and more powerful than the rest , unfair that FIA allows the champion the fastest car for 7 years
That Alonso's pass on Ocon was personal
Missing the goat mazepin 😂😂😂
Yuki's penalty is unfair
i think now i know who'll win the next race
Let's go Sades!!!!!!
although I want a different winner, this was a very decent grand Prix in terms of overtakes.
Crazy Max🔥🔥
Yuki is mvp
Max is just in his own planet at the moment
Another boring race..........it be cool if cars were actually competitive against each other instead watching the midfield. it be nice to see teams fight for 1st place
I think this is the point Aston Martin start to lose ground against Mercedes. Alonso had a very anonymous weekend.
Max is too OP on this race, he's only highlighted on start and the end of the race 😂😂
Perez need lot to learn
Congratulations Max Verstappen you are a 3 time f1 champion.
Ferrari are back to 2021. The midfield is real 😥🙇‍♂️ Congratulations Max for the 2023 title on race 7. What a snooze of a race.
Ocon still driving dangerously and still not being penalized. Guess all Mercedes junior drivers are taught to do so..
Sainz is so bad, doesn't deserve a seat in Ferrari
ggez
Merc is back!!!!!
🇪🇸✌🏻
Really miss the “lights out and away we go” 😢
We never saw Max after the 1st corner, not until the finish line. Didn't even see how Max went over the White line.  His entire race happened in the background.
Another Verstappen win... Thrilling. 😒
イカれてんのか？頭
Another snooze fest of a Grand Prix … zzzzz so boring
Do you guys get bored of this watching the same driver winning over and over again, If you are, go watch Nascar or Indycar
Verstappen is making F1 boring.
everyone can cut corners now? thanks George!
What an overtaking frenzy this race has been ! phenomenal work by Perez rising to the top and not everyday you get to see 2 Mercs on the podium lol. Great work by these peeps
And it's lights out and away we go!
Another clean race, no yellow flag, safety car, red flag or retirements. That's the second one this season. Max Verstappen has only 2 wins left to surpass Ayrton Senna's record. He's impressive. Mercedes Benz is however gaining on Red Bull a little bit. Great race!!!!
Unacceptable
Just bring back Martin Brundle
What? Penalty for yuki?!?!!!
Toto 👏🏻👏🏻
Well done, Max 👏 ✔️ 👍 pères did well also 😊😊
B O R I N G  WATCH INDYCAR INSTEAD  B O R I N G  WATCH MOTOGP INSTEAD  B O R I N G
You guys should do a compilation of all weather reports from russel
Alonso donating points to the team owners son? Calculated old fox 😏
George really tried to fake the whole paddock 😂
No dnf in this race🎉
Please apologize to Yuki at first. His point is robbed. Worst stewards ever.
Progress for Merc but they are still light years behinnd RB when it comes to the car.
Seems harsh on yuki but I’m not sure how well Zhou could’ve stuck around if he had the space. Yuki was ahead going into the corner so I would think he’s entitled to it unless I’m seeing things wrong. I guess there’s some rule and this whole complex of turns specifically lead to him getting the penalty
Mercedes coming from the holidays… they scare all the grid now 🙈
6:20.   And THAT is why I hate this sport.
The Ferraris are woeful 😢
So boring
Max Verstappen probably one or the greatest driver out there. A super rare mix between SENNA and Michael SCHUMACHER.
Tsunoda's penalty is unacceptable.
Not bad for Mercedes 24 seconds behind.
Is that a Grand Slam for Max?
Max Verstappen Three times world champion...
Yuki deserves a 10 Sec. penalty
As fernando said : " 5 seconds is a yoke" Yuki robbed 👺
Hknfgk
Boring!!
He is Pro Max truly.  Rest insignificant.. time sheets say it ... not me😂
I respect the engineers and all the work it takes to be the fastest but in terms of competition this is disgraceful. Clio cup races and really any other open wheel series is just so much more enjoyable
A video of meaningless (manufactured by DRS) overtakes. Overtaking isn't racing. F1 is awful nowadays. (Compare this awful tedium with the recent Indy 500).
mclaren is idiot team the season...😡😡😡 needed chenges.
Ocon’s driving skills on another lvl  Best defence
Holy cow....Mercedes on average only 3 tenths slower than Max (not RB...) is quite a surprising achievement....
That redbull is insane, you can tell how much faster is than te rest by looking at how easy is for checo to pass everyone
What was the upgrade
Surprised they managed to get 8 mins of highlights out of that 😴😴😴
How was the Yuki/Zhou tangle even pushing off track? There was space there on the left for Zhou and Yuki was turning to the right.
Best race of the season so far
Speaks volumes on how dull F1 is when the highlight reel consists solely of DRS passes down the start finish straight. We saw absolutely nothing on the rest of the track.
Mercedes double podium!❤
great drive by Russel for recovery from yesterday.  He started the race behind Perez and stayed ahead the whole race.  Perez's recovery drive wasn't bad, but I have a feeling, had it been Verstappen had some kind of error and started 11th, he would have won anyways.
Easy to take for granted where Mercedes just came from lol.
Boring Race. More overtakes than last year but no real fights. Slow pit stops all the time. Max dominating everything. Ferrari doing Ferrari things (especially with Leclerc)
no surprise from Ferrari
Max sounds bored on team radio after the wins now lol
Gave up after the 200th overtake (about a third in...) at the seemingly only corner at the track. Dull AF.
Might as well stop watching now. It's gone from Lewis winning every race to Max. Boring once again.
I am sure Verstapen won.... F1 needs to change something here
Battles for P14 are great to watch but easily forgetful in the long run.
everybody's getting bored with f1's golden boy, aren't we.😀
I don't expect anything from Lando  But somehow he still disappoints me
Verstappen really do be playing on 0% AI
L F1
The only bar in Bali i could find that was showing this race also had a drag queen show on stage. This race was boring compared to that.
Happy for mercedes and alpine
why yuki get penalty. FIA should removed his penalty.  it's not motor race.
George Russell goes off the line and overtakes Hulkenberg and Piastri but he only returns the position back to Hulk. Why no one is saying that?  And with Yuki, i'll have to see his onboard but  to me the defense didn't deserve a penalty.
角田くんのペナルティーは納得いかない😠
Boring
角田へのJUDGEMENTは間違っている
mercedes coming back up the order with their new upgrades!
Bring back 'Lights out and away we go'.
So removing the chicane made the racing better?
Yuki shouldn’t have a penalty! Great race all in all.
Russell, perez and leclerc was the men of the gp... Great performance
What a BS penalty for Tsunoda
Just give Max the world title for the 2023 season because he is too overpowered
I feel like Sainz could have held his line at T1; he’d probably get pushed out but had room and probably wouldn’t have been penalized for holding his pace.  Later results shows it probably wouldn’t have made a difference, alas!
yuki robbed
Lh44 the 🐐
Mad bull🔥
does RB have a NOS tank in their fuel cell?
What are Ferrari playing at.  They called Binotto a clown…..
AMR not so strong now that they signed the Honda deal.
Norris from hero to zero.  the most difficult of the race is the balance of aggression on the first lap  as well as not break the car.
Really bad highlights. We don’t get any sense of how the race evolved. Just a reel of contextless overtakes
Merc fans have personality disorders
Unfortunately Lando hero to zero in the first lap. What a shame I didn't expect him to hold p3 in the tractor but was expecting at least a 6th place.
Ocon should be given a five-year penalty.
what happened to crofty and brundle? i miss their commentating
Someone help Ferrari please!
i havent seen both mercedes on podium in such a long time 😭
End of Season result - 1st Redbull 2nd Mercedes 3rd Ferrari. Max is already the champion of this season.
Could F1 get any more boring?   Rhetorical question.
Leclerc went from p19 to p11 but not a single mention of him this race huh. Would’ve liked to see some of those overtakes.
I didn't think Yuki pushed Zhou off the track looked pretty normal to me
Nicht mal uninteressant das Rennen. Mercedes überraschend stark, Ferrari peinlich schwach, Aston Martin gut dabei, aber schwächer als bisher ubnd wie so oft ist Haas nur im Qualifying einigermaßen gut. Im Rennen wie gehabt hinten anzutreffen.
mafia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yuki just protected his way
I can’t believe that Alonso said “stroll, don’t worry, I’ll get close to you but not overtake you” on radio, is that a joke…?
Congratulations to the Red Bull car for winning everything this year.
What happened to the former commentator of 2021?
For Mercedes to only be 24 seconds back at the end shows a huge step up for that car.
Funny ferary hahahaha
Feels bad for Yuki
😴😴
Mercedes is back
If only Red Bull didn't break the budget cap it would be a close season. Shame.
Hamimimimilton mostrando que ele joga sujo e não for punido.
Whoever stretched this to 8 mins is truly talented
For some of the defending I saw in this race how did YUKI get a penalty!
Yuki didn’t deserve that penalty
It's getting boring now... There is no challenge to Max
Without the penalty, Yuki was simply the best of the rest in this race!
Exciting😴
F1 is boring😂
角田にペナルティーはどう見てもおかしいだろ。
Supa Max again..
Alonso slowly passing a stationary Tsunoda on the track?
MAX AMAZING 😍
Sainz should have get  p2.
Nice
😢😢
Grande corrida da Mercedes  Hamilton e George
OHHH MCLAREN!! 😢
F1 turned so boring!
Carlos terrible driver 😅😅😅
It’s unfair for Yuki
Only 18 cars start?
Another Sunday another Dutch anthem 🤣
Pretty boring watching the same drivers win every time while the rest of the field doesn't have a chance.
Please remove this race from the calendar. It's always incredibly boring.
I only see the best overtake of the month in fernando
Great car race ...
GG, boring DRS only moves...
Its boring now.. everyone is racing for 2nd position
Whatt a night
Yawn
.............................................
Max is in a league of his own
Wicked 🎉
Glad Zhou could score points today, as an alfa fan every point counts💯🔥
Boring race, unsubbed
Imagine how amazing this season would be if Red Bull didn't exist.
boring and shittest race ....front car is leading with +18 seconds .. what a joke no competition
Very unfortunate for Norris. Overall a fun race, lots of overtakes
Yuki's penalty was total BS
No proper fights, except Zhou v Tsunoda.
as a dutch fan its not even fun anymore to watch the F1...
I miss Crofty
Everytime Mercedes was passing a team, had me smiling and crying of joy😂😂. The car seem stable, let us have the speed now.
- Russell overtaking 3 cars outside the track = no penalty.  - Sainz starting 2nd finishing 5th + Leclerc without points = Ferrari Fail.  - Alonso sleeping through the whole race + wont overtake Stroll because the BOSS is watching  Fail Racing 1 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
DRS is destroying races . Stop DRS
I haven’t seen the video but I’m sure verstappen won
Why is crofty and martin no more in the commentary can someone explain me??
Max is approaching F1's elite in race wins.
i dont think mercedes got better. others got worse { joke }
I cancelled my F1TV Pro because Rigged Bull is boring
The most epic race so far
Day by day i dislike George more ...where is that humble and down to earth guy from Williams? Happy for Verstappen but sad for Norris and Charles 😢😢
Checo RETÍRATE
Great camera angles
ferari yes
Tsunodas penalty is still weird to me
The decision FIA made today was inconsistent. I just miss the og f1 back in 2010s.
Norris going from 3rd to 17 is just heart breaking! 😭
Christian Horner face when they were 2 mercedes drivers on the podium. He was dying inside
Ridiculous penalty for Yuki
boring race nothing special, train with 20 wagons
Sir Hamilton
Poor Lando  Gutted😭😭
At this point I truly believe that Max can win all the remaining races this season. The combination of this racemonster and Max is unbeatable and unstoppable. Only mechanical failure could stop him.
Before max came to f1 ...I didn't know the Dutch anthem.. now it's a ringer ever Sunday in my mind
One more victory and Max will be equal to Ayrton Senna in terms of the number of victories. Max has 40 wins, Ayrton has 41. We are watching history, my friends.
How they managed to get 8 minutes worth of Highlights in this race is shocking.
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
What a race! Mercedes 2-3, Alonso 7th, Russell and Perez recovering was brilliant to watch!
Did Verstappen score a grand slam on this race?
wait there were highlights?
Congratulations to Max on winning the third championship 🏆🏆🏆 🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱
Whingelonso bodied and exposed Fraud in th e second fastest car Time for him to retire
Max again proving why he's the best today, irrefutably. Above everyone in a league that's also within a league of its own. Phenomenal drive. 40 wins is just insanity! He could be over 50 wins by the end of the season. Let. That. Sink. In. 🙏

Poor Norris :(
Lets go mercedes
Perez Sabotage 😂😂😂
FIA destroyed Yuki's race with 5 minutes of discussion while he pushed hard showing a wonderful performance over an hour.
Russell from 12 to third, this is a strong showing from Mercedes
Bring Crofty back!
I'm surprised of Yuki's penalty. I mean sure it wasn't 100% clean but at the same time I don't think it deserves 5 second penalty.
I just imagine max in his car singing and drinking tea like the French dude on talladega nights 😂
What highlights?
Won the race..led every lap..fastest lap..pole position..topped Q1 Q2 Q3..topped every practice session..guess who?
Russel: it’s raining turn 5 Engineer: u sweating mate
How did the editors find 8 minutes of highlights?
boring  season red bull is space shuttle
That Ferrari is just as fast as the Red Bull... It's how Max drives off the corner that really sets them apart
This is not the race that Lando deserved he deserved to be in the top five hope that he will comeback next week with a strong race.
Lewis ❤
5 sec penalty for Yuki is a joke
Russell not getting penalty but gaining 5 places ???
Give the points back to Yuki.
Max Verstappen, you are a three time world champion!
Norris really can’t catch a break this season
So soon! Love it!!
Hamilton best driver this weekend
Aston Martin again with a brilliant strategy 😂. Soft tyres in start and sfot again in 1 st pitstop
summary: russel pranked the whole f1 community
George Russel starts sweating: 'Guys, it's raining!'
Max is on fire but it's becoming a boring season that nobody apart from Perez hasn't challenge him. F1 has lost it's spirit of who wins the race and it's so predictable now. 😑
Russell didnt get a penalty but Yuki did, while what Yuki did was not even penalty worthy. British bias? Perhaps. Fia are clowns? For sure
What a race in terms of overtakes! Tsunoda Zhou and Hulkenberg fighting for points was amazing. Russell and Perez coming back from bad quali and Alonso should be Stroll's engineer
It is tough to be a McLaren fan these days
Max needs to stop winning, it's getting boring now
sPain for Lando 😢
Nico trolling the grid was the most entertaining part of this race
Amazing race
Midfield is more competitive now but there is no excitement because no one is fighting for the win except Verstappen.
we dont want these commentators, they sound fake and over-enthusiastic. Please bring Croftys commentary back
Incredible race from both Tsunoda and Zhou today, shame about Yuki's penalty
Russel starts sweating: 'Guys, it's raining!
100% boring race record continues in 2023.
Snoozefest.
Justice for Yuki..!!
Tsunoda Penalty for that... So is it okay for Verstappen to demon block against Sainz first? Is it okay for Ocon to overprotect Alonso? Russell hit Hamilton during qualifying and broke Hamilton's front wing, right? I have a lot of doubts about the FIA ​​minimum. After all, I was not in contact with Tsunoda.
Very boring! Much rather watch the very exciting TT road racing! With the 22 time winner Mr Michael Dunlop. Very talented! The Dunlop family!
I miss the old F1 race edits.
Mercedes where something else today. Fair play to their first podium a double podium
gg
again, why is this one release faster than F2 Feature Race highlight?
Yuki, never give up. you have a bright future.
Huge improvement for Mercedes 👍👍
Why is Yuki penalized？？？？？
Happy to see lewis back on the podium.
I like to think there’s an alternate universe where there was loads of rain this race and George mistook all of it for his own sweat.
George Russel starts sweating: 'Guys, rain in turn 5!'
Well done the Mercedes boys for serving most of the entertainment in this race.
Legendary plan by Ferrari team again, no words😂

Excellent drive from Russell. He had an adventurous weekend, to be sure, but he delivered when it mattered.
😮
zz
All twenty drivers are still on the track. I think has been enough to say that the circuit changes have been a positive change, a mixture of tyre strategies that does bring the race alive at different stages in the circuit. The Spanish fans will be disappointed not to see one of their men in more prominent positions, but both have had a disappointing Grand Prix.
That was perfect race to take sleep
Congratulations Mercedes
What a shame for lando😢
Don't give penalties for your whims
