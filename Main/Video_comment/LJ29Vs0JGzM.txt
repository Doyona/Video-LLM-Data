Hello Father
DanTDM and Pewpew collab???
That is so funny I'm not gonna lie I know it's from 2 years ago but that's sick❤😂😂😂
Reccomendations
Man, if I could meet 3 channels, it would be Dan, Stampy, and MatPat
Why am I getting recommend by the algorithm now in 2024
Anyone else here in 2024?
Why is this on my feed after all those years? Is it because I watched 'thicc of it' memes a lot lol
Its already been 2 years.. time flies bro..
1:01 Dan would make a good voice for an anime school girl lol
YouTube algorithm is crazzyy 🤣
Blue and red 😂
Lee Ronald Young Mark Gonzalez Susan
Casually says other house
PewDiePie has a samsung oddesy g9
1:00 "Kiiihihihihii🤭🤭🤭" he is so coquette and preppy
i just unintentionally watched this entire vid in preview mode....
0:36 “So my F is” 💀
bro uses a neumann for streaming damn he rich rich
2 years ago and this dropped in my recommendations
“To be honest we both need” war commences
it hit me differently this time when he said "just be on the verge of tears every time you record" he was sad back then wasn't he... I'm so sorry for not noticing before.🫂
Best neck when ur 75?
This is just perfect.
He has the sparkles in he’s eyes that means he’s gonna cry me: no he’s not gonna cry
🇮🇱☹️
3:41 "So many people.. have the microphone" *white noise silence* *big squeak, Dan bringing his microphone into camera view* "NOT ANYMOAR!"  Thats funny >w<
i aint sure about $6B
I’ve always admired your setup
Dantdm we rather have a diamond minecart in the back
I thought Dan said a bad word while watching this😂
Maybe I should get some weapons.
NO UR TO BIGGGGGGGGGG
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me -Philippians 4:13❤
You have the smallest monitor I've ever seen on a YouTuber's setup before. 1:37. Respect! Even I have a similiar sized monitor back in the days.
Khehe. Live it
You should collaborate with thinknoodles again
My monitor is stand is so low I need two books or it looks discolored
Is this what YouTubers find interesting😂
I’m the newest comment
Heyyyyyy

6:30 my cable management is worse for sure
4:48 that censor sound effect lol
Did anyone realize that Dan said he had another house?!
S B 7 3 7
We not in JAPAN!
thats stupid
They both had pugs, imagine Ellie and Darcie meet edger and maya
show us the wires dan... show the wires
Dan: “I have no weapons” Me: *starts naming a bunch of obscure objects in his office that can be used as weapons*
seeing pewd (my cousin's childhood) react to Dan (my childhood was a bizarre thing to see
Dan really said, 'At my other house' so casually... lol
Tehehe
I am a firm believer for office chairs instead of gaming chairs. office chairs are built to be comfortable to sit in for hours with lots of back support gaming chairs on the other hand are mostly meant to look flashy
Your so good
I agree that people should put their monitors higher
At by your 60 we will have you to 100 mil
My setups smol and is just a desk, chair, broken laptop, and actual working electronics 😂  Edit 1:also random stuff to draw with (im an artist irl)
1:20 I didn’t know Dantdm was German 😂
wot
I don’t mind where ur camera is people can see and hear you and that’s the point
emBArasing
whenever someone asks me for setup suggestions i’ll just send them this video
The sparkles reminds me of diamonds if you know what mean
Did Dan just say "other house"???
OO U
These youtubers be using professional mics while i’m over here using an 8 year old blue snowball 😎
What if : Pewdipie reacts to you reacting to him reacting to you 😂
Mega click bait
6:32 DAN WHAT THE HELL IS THAT CABLE MANAGEMENT
i loved it when he said "i should get some weapons'....."🤣
Dan and don’t be embarrassed for bad cable management. I keep all my cables on my bedroom floor because I’m too lazy to pick them up.
teheeeeheee made me laughing 0:59
At what other house now?!😲
Casually telling us he has a second
Dan I am sorry :(
Have to say red lightning looks better
hey dan say ssssssssnake to your wife and 2 kids 😂
I have got to be honest and say that I agree with PewDiePie that Dan does indeed have Sparkling Eyes. Not the crying part though.
Really disappointed in you being a fan of pewdiepie. Unsubscribed :/
Just realised we are watching a vid of dan watching a video of pewdiepie watching a videos of dan
2:57 this shot does NOT do his forehead justice
i'd love it if you released some songs and music once in a while :)
imagine if pewdiepie reacted to danTDM reacting to pewdiepie reacting to danTDM XP
BOOMER NECK!-
Dan...you are better in ways!😂
Also sry I’m late to this vid
Yo Dan you met my sister in irl lol I watched you since the time doctor tray set you and thinknoodels  up for lucky blocks I’m just saying I’m an OJ
Sb737 !
NECKS LOL
You could try setting the camera on the side
ill take your goxlr
9:43 Is He Rich Or Sum????
dan: i should get some weapons'   me: you  have a child that has access to that room
tbh i love dans setup much more than other youtubers. it is just so. professional looking
Dan, the ShureSM7B was made for Podcasters, Musicians and Voice Overs
bro he makes me so happy😭
1:01   KeEe~ hEee~ HEeE~
The GOXLR Blep Button
You, Jacksepticeye, Markiplier, and Stampy are the OGs. Y’all were my childhood YouTubers
Dan: I need to get some more weapons  His kids:Dad what's that in your roo-
0:11
He*
How did her get invisible braces?
Every youtuber in 2020 2:58
My desk is the most cluttered thing in the world.
did dan even spot the black pug in the picture🙂
emmm dan butt pads are for womens to make their butt look bigger🤣🤣🤣
doesnt the a7 3 not have a flipable viewfinder? i think the 7 c wouldve been a better choice imo
2:56 he is only looking in to your soul ❤
This video was made 1 year ago today. Happy birthday
9:42 every time he says "other house" I feel so poor.
0:58 he's already getting giggly
02:57  sooooooo cringey
ThefinsterSTREAMS
Love your videos
what's that new mic called?
The ✨️sPaRkLe✨️ in his eyes!
Hi dan
'' I'm going to have the best neck''
Dan should get the new Samsung Odyssey Neo G8
“My other house” *dan got rich fast*
Bro reacted to a reaction
Blue vs Red
THATS SOOOO LOW HIS MONITER
The diamond minecart, makes minecraft videos every day, doesn't he wanna suicide? - PewDiePie 2016
What you practice while you are alive will determine what you will be in eternity. As it is written in the word of God, some will go to eternal life, but the others who refused the price of their ransom paid by the Lord Jesus, will go to eternal fire along with the devil and his angels. Beloved, look for an evangelical church closer to you and attend it, try to do your part by learning and practicing the word of God, without caring about the mistakes of others. Read the bible, learn and practice while you have time.
I also think Dan should use a green screen. Not all the time, but in some videos
Dan should get a curved monitor
Lâu quá rồi mới nghe anh Đức Phúc hát, thích quá đi thôi.
I have the same braces as you
Pewdipies name is Felix because Dan said we all need that FELIX at 2:31
Fun fact: the shure SM57 is the best mic for drum kits
your setup looks so cool :0
Do it change ur seyu
"I don't really stream that much anymore"  (Insert maniacal laughing here)
Nooooooo he got rid of dantdm chair
Bro pulled out a whole katana
Supsb
hey dan i love the vids
its sad when you think about the fact... some of dantdms current subscribers are probably dead... but they couldnt unsubscribe IF THEY WANTED TO (and they wouldn't want to... but im just mentioning it.)
L
ME I THINGK DANTDM:S EYES LOOK COOL😎😎😎
it would be cool if he subed to my channel cause he is fav youtuber
Dan: “I should get more weapons” Me: … YOU HAVE A KID?!?!?!
Can you post your music?
3:47 Evil laugh
dan is flexing saying "i boght this $800 ting and i dont use it" hahahaha
high monitor resistance
You should play guitar for us 😍😍😍
i hated reaction videos until i watched dans ones then i loved them and i legit only watch reactions lol or i do reactions but not on yt
hello😀
When dan said can you see it he jump scared me.
OH GOLLY!!!
Who is better pewdiepie or danTDM
0:58 made me burst
I think my messy cables are beautiful, Dan will learn to love them.
Dan make PewDiePie react to this video
he's got the blue, pewds has got the red, it's only a matter of time before they become Jedi and fight the setups out
He criticizes every YouTuber except himself
Pewdiepies a bully
Dan is slowly becoming a boomer..
“at my other house” jesus Dan.
Dan should have a microphone called the Neumann TDM102
Dan's getting roasted by Pewdiepie!? I ain't having it!
there is nothing better than pulling an all-nighter and watching my favorite childhood youtuber.
Kinda forgot Dan could play guitar
yes
You know your good when the top youtuber compliments you
can i have the old stuff
To be honest, I love your old 10-20 minute short videos, they kinda give me nostalgia (and I am a twelve year old, so just imagine a six year old that has access to his grandmas computer)
<o/
Dans gonna go from winning gaming awards to music awards💀
dan you are perfect as is
My cables are Al over my desk no one is judging Dan 😂😂😂
Rtrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr is fine 🙂 😍 👌 😢 😩 😋 🙂 😍 👌 😢 😩 😋 🙂 😍 👌 😢 😩 is a very important person for me to help you to be an excellent person for your business to help you to get back in contact and I will be very keen for your kind reply as I have not been to your class until now so please reply as to the request to change your address as soon I will have the full address so that we may
1:01 DanTDM: **school girl giggle**
i'm watching dan watch Pewdiepie watching dan
THE WAY HE CHANGED FROM 2016 TO 2022 IS CRAZY.
"I need an extra screen, I need some extra weapons, maybe some robots"
Dan where's your spider who messed up the wires
Now I'm unsubscribing to pewdiepie
This video makes me think PEWDIEPIE IS MEAN
You have two houses!?
Pewdewpie one day: Let's salute Dan Pewdewpie the other day: LoL he has high camera
dan: hey son what you watching? dans son: oh hi dad im watching dre... dan: *kiks son out* YOUR NO SON OF MINE!!
I remember when PewDiePie said that! Too funny 😂
I cry when I saw the cables
You have good setup
Lol
1:47 kinda sus man
can't you make your chair shorter ?
9:42 okay Dan, we get it. You’re rich (,:
why do you have 2 pcs
Tee hee hee
"It's really long compared to everyone elses" DanTDM 2022
I just realised , your new nose is worse than the old one
How does this guy still have SOO many subs. It's just nostalgia at this point
is it just me or is pewdiepie running linux?
Dan, the main reason I love your videos is because not that we're both British but also the fact you dont swear! so my 3yr old and 10yr old and 12yr old boys can watch without me needing to keep an eye on what they watching. Your always politely talking aswell. Thanks for making videos for all ages Dan.
Imagine if pewdiepie reacted to this
1:01 this got me laughing
Me: watching pewdiepie talking about dantdm :me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I think your camera looks really good at that level. It’s way better in my opinion
4:06
*Dan casually reacts to a video reacting to a video*
Right when Dan started crying, I started crying because I choked on my drink
Stampy is gonna have the best neck cuz he has such a good set up fo fit his chair
9
Pewdiepie is a big YouTuber but no one talks about him anywhere I’ve been
Someone set up a gofund me page for Dan's cables
You've become a lot more humorous compared to your old Minecraft days, you're less awkward and you are a lot more entertaining to watch.  You also give off that dad vibe. XD
RIP Technoblade
I play Trombone...
love the setup but think you can upgrade it again
lol
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!
I started YouTube with an iPod it works!
This video is sponsored by: Everything
HI DANILE
this video is also just a tour of his set up
the way dan just said 'teehee' made me WHEEZE (1:00)
Hmm good enouph setup also for weapons feel special to you craft them yourself... Search up tutorials and get the materials...
What's with MINECRAFT YouTubers ending up doing music
9:58 not on purpose but yeah...
i think im the only girl who watches dan :<
I think we need to do a setup tour v2

1:01 HIS LAUGH OMG HAHAHAH  So cute

0:57 Just wanted to include this.
I have a office chair
WE SHOULD REALLY APPRECIATE HIS CONTENT
Day 4 of asking for subs
My dog stepped on a bee
at the end of the vid when he whips out the katana I'm yelling it's a two-handed weapon not a one-handed weapon
If your account don’t listen to him I wouldn’t want you anymore
Those wires are a fire waiting to happen
Dan really cares about his neck💀
Just get a smaller chair
My friend dabed
Yeh
*smacc* *smacc* *smacc* epik sound effects
Hi
Why is dan so destined to have pewds' approval
Sorry but Dan’s setup is waaaaaaaaaayyyy BETTER than pewds if i have to be honest.
Dan bragging about his two houses😂😊
This man got invisiline from the commercials
wow! A video with a youtuber reacting to a youtuber reacting to the same youtuber. SB737 is in the comments 3 youtubers in one video.

Dan was blushing at the start
Sb
I am the same way with my monitor.
Tiny dan
You do not sound any different to me

Just cause PewDiePie is famous doesn't mean sometimes he's really mean
The fact that Piewdiepie have a Real Katana in his Office startled me
S m a c c
1:01 laughing my head off
He said 3 and put 4 fingers up
I love the Game Boy merch

@DanTDM you can take you’r camera in the middel of you’r cumputers
Dan I gotta remind u that anything can be a weapon be careful and look behind u
Inspiring continue

You could just have your seat low so that the monitor can be low and your neck and back doesn't slouch in the future.
SIUUY
i actually have pewdiepies monitor it's the odesy g9 it's really good has 240htz and is honestly a bit under rated

Oh no I love seeing someone crying or in misery its my favorite
HHahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
“Maybe I should get some more weapons?”

I subbed when u made ur 20th mod review of the diamond minecart and dr tryuras and grim and my childhood and the old lab not the new
I was watching dan when i was 8,  And stopped at the age of 10,  And now i am 16 and watching this vids makes me feel of my old days.😊☺️  Keep up the good work dan. 👍
DanTDM my brother close to my house
**smac**
GUYS HE HAS A SINGING MICROPHONE   ENDIGO GET READY
Pretty good.
WAIT I know that video 🤣🤣🤣🤣
.
I can't be the only one who thinks that Dan and Pewds should do a Minecraft series
you were in free guy
"I think its at my other house?" Wow dan just flexing on us right there. 👺
Fun fact : I don't watch PewDiePie AT ALL
To explain about the "prank/mischief" ("いたずら" (itazura) in Japanese) thing on his monitor, it's the name of their latest drop by Tsuki, their (his and Marzia's) clothing brand.... so it's either a subtle ad, OR he's just practicing his Japanese, because that's Anki he has up, an SRS app used for memorizing words and such, which he HAS mentioned he uses. or maybe both even xP
nice
I dnt know why everyone gives this much importance to PewDiePie. His words and thoughts are not that truthful and legit. He is just trying to be funny but i dnt think PewDiePie is funny anymore 🤟 no hating, just my opinion
“I haven’t watched it yet” shows watched video
When did he change his profile pic?
This feel nostalgic watching him again...
its not Game boy Its Game Man
Still love his laugh 😂
I don't have to worry about boomer neck because I'm short 😂👍👍👍
Loving the game now hoodie
Were no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never   gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it And if you ask me how I'm feeling Don't tell me you're too blind to see Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up) We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye…..

10:13 Oh, he doesn’t know He doesn’t know the old, crazy PewDiePie… And how many times he’s been kicked out
DAN we want to hear your music!!!
That pewdiepie joke about his eyes were so good because I thought it was a compliment until he said the last half of it.
Dan: I should buy more weapons  Me: U HAVE A SON THAT WILL  RANDOMLY WALK IN
Dantdm doesn't creiy
Hope pewdiepie makes a video reacting to you reacting to him reacting to you
When dan gets some weapons Asher come a steals them
Bro why are there tents on the ceiling

I haven't watched Dan since the MC days but I'm genuinely surprised he's managed to adapt to the new YT environment and now he looks more satisfied than before.
Don't get weapons (you have a kid)
yea having your monitor low is really  painfull
2:56 The death stare
I love this
dantdm: at my other house. also him:  im jealous of his monitor
It has been 5 years since the last upload on more moreTDM ;(
Childhood
Dan+weapons=bad idea
Keep Up The Good Work Love Ur Content 💗
WE NEED A COLLAB BICHES
COLLAB !
They look the same
Huh 26Mil subs. Feels old man
9:57 what did u say??
what keyboard and piano keyboard do you use
Dan's reacting to pewdiepie reacting to urself
Ofcourse the only time I watch 1 of pewdiepie's videos someone else reacts to it
YAH THIS GOOD VID YAH HUH YAH GOOD VID CROSSOVER YAH YAH YEP GOOD VID YAH MMMM
I dont know who you are, but Im here for more PDP content. Thanks.
So fun to see people reacting to people reacting. Be better
I think its so cool as how I got older I realize how much me and my childhood hero have in common. I just recently got into music and am trying to start a band with  my friends and maybe if we get really good, someday dan will hear about my music and maybe even listen to it. :)
funny
He didn't see pewds cable management...🤐
Dan Can you remember Sans?
He has a shotgun. He has a weapon.
Dan:I got zero weapons Me:You got your guitars🤨
Dan has the blue theme setup and pewds got red theme setup, really nice to see on one frame
yo the sad face worked for me i subbed
Neumann is 😍😍😍 good job
My two childhood heroes in one video made my day :)
You definitely need that ultra wide. 👀 9:50
Remember when dan died his hair blue? Good times
Can’t wait for Pewdiepie to react to Dan reacting to himself reacting to Dan( wow that is a tongue twister)
Say a name of a game that brings back memories
Ever since I was a kid I wanted to see the both of them collaborate
camera suggestion: try putting the camera on the side of your monitor.
That's definitely a compliment.
Dan
I got those invisalign things too.The little hook things on your teeth will the cut inside of your cheeks for sometime but you will get used to it
Dan is gonna cry all over his set up and in the middle of the video were going to hear a scream and dan is going to just leave us
Because shotgun microphones are noisy, that's why,
26M subs, who are these YouTubers? Why I get them suggested? 😂
lol react as if you havent watched his video already and probably a few times as well..
he should make a song on Spotify
DO IT BUY A BIG ONE THREE MONITHOR IS NOT GOOD
this was kinda just an excuse for dan to flex his setup
DANTDM IS THE BEST YOUTUBER EVER!!!!!!
DanTDM in a few years will have an immaculate neck
HELL YEAH 😩
I love the cable management it’s the #1 fire hazard for everyone in my house
0:33 I just finished watching some braces videos and saw this video on my feed and was surprised u too have braces now lol.
pooooods
His camera placement makes us superior having the higher ground
do it  new set up
I’m gonna be honest Dan has always been entertaining happy he’s still making great vids he’s a big part of my childhood   Thanks Dan! <3
i have my moniter so you can only see my hair
Dan blue, Pewds Red
TDM - Team Death Match
Please stop pausing this
Felix's monitor is so satisfying. When I saw it I was dumbfounded why no one else seems to have figured out that instead of 3-4 monitors, why not just a big, long one that looks amazing??????
You need it
With the black and white filter he looks 50.
@pewdiepie
What happened to roblox?
Well, it definitely, worked because, I subscribed!
Dan:has a kid  Also dan:i should get a weapon
we r lerning mor about u and ur setup it looks cool !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ergonomically iirc your eye level should be about 2/3 to the top of the monitor
We do you have b4ases
clickbait
Er.
Just change the monitor slight bigger and buy Sony headphones. Trust me is worth it
Dan appreciating ergonomics. Good job!
Dan BEST neck :DDDDDD ( Totally not lying )
Can I get some Weapons too?
I was here
@PewDiePie hope you see this XD
Minimalist Dan: "I only own one curved monitor" Stonks Dan: "it's at my *other house* "
You can see his Xbox Controller 6:37
We're watching a video on a video that's also on a video...    Incredible 👌
Dan: confused why he dose not have any weapons. Asher: OHHHH SHINY KATANA
Wait did he just say another house…. DAN HAS 2 HOUSES!?
😂💀🗿
that little teehheee he was so funny at the beginning
GET THE WIDE SCREEN ITS 1000000000000000X WIDE I DARE U
This is kinda random but who else wants dan to sing balls in yo jaws 🙂     JUST me? Ok...
The Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is a pretty good audio interface, we use them in my Audio Engineering class. I personally own the Shure SM58 microphone, it was really worth the purchase and it will last me for years. I don’t however own my own interface or cable, so the microphone is only useful when I’m working in the audio lab at school. ;v;
Dan can milk 10 minutes from a small clip
looking forward to dan's neck!
Is Dan preparing for Endigo or what
your boomer neck posture doesn't rely that much on whether you look your monitor up or down. If you're standing on a chair every day for many hours without significant pauses,  and if you're not making workouts and specific exercises while also not eating proper food, you'll still get some kind of spinal curvature no matter how you look at your monitor. What's more, those who are watching monitors by looking it up, tend to blink less resulting in much serious eye drying and pressure, and the problems that follows this. So proper food and common exercises are more important than the way you think you should look your monitor.
Dan you’re saying the goxlr/ goxlr mini both using the same pre amp. Is worse than a focusrite scarlet. If were talking the solo you just need to spend more time. In the software for the goxlr/mini I have the mini and use the software to make my mice sound better than my old focusrite scarlet solo. Take a minute and it will be a lot better. So the goxlr has a better preamp than the focusrite scarlet solo.
BOOMER NECK! - DanTDM, 2022
wAhT.
I've been watching you since I was 6 now I'm 14
🍪🍪🍪
Does anybody know what chair dan uses now???

It's sad how Dan has no twitch videos up or anything 😔

Your chair costs more than my PC and im running a RTX 2060
The top of the monitor is suppose to be eye level, that is the best position for your neck and eyes
why are the mids so loud in your voice
Right Dan very serious question! Would you ever consider learning to horse ride? Idk why but I feel it’s something you would be good at! I’ve done it my whole life and it’s sooo fun and makes an awesome series to make! So would you ever try it? Love all your vids too  keep up the amazing work  ❤️

Hey Dan, you probably won’t see this, but I just wanted to thank you for giving me some of the best moments of my childhood. I loved coming home to watch your videos every day after school. You’re entire thing has changed so that I can’t help but smile think about how far you’ve come. Thank you for everything! :)

Ok guys but who else is craving a Minecraft puzzle map vid
Just casually says “ my other house “ 😂
Do you no who grian is ?

You HAVE to change your set up, you MUST make it your goal to beat Pewdiepie in the ✨set up war✨
I have a Sony 87 3 he says as he holds up 4 fingers
now Im waiting for ‘reacting to Dan reacting to me reacting to him ‘
dantdm swore OMGOMGGGGGGGOMG  9:55
He can shift his PC's height tho, it might make dan even more interested in buying it 😄
Next thing you know dan might make a video about his pc specs lol
He said he has zero weapons but then I don’t know why people don’t use the pistol microphone

Can you make another setup tour sense you got some improvements
You should of got the white version of your microphone
POV: PewDiePie and DanTDM plays Minecraft [pvp
Please, that RTX 3090 of yours is just asking for a monitor upgrade. Go with an LG 38" ultrawide, or maybe even the upcoming Dell QD-OLED ultrawide, it's such a huge improvement.
Music Dan or Musical Dan sounds great
Hey Dan are you acoustic or electric guitar fan? Just asking
"I don't have any weapons, I should get some." Ever heard of the second amendment?
So nobody's gonna say that they want to hear dan's music...
4:28 TLM: The Low Microphone :)
So you're now doing music... but you still won't colab with Endigo?! Dan, COME ON!

You're talking about starting setups I don't really have a proper set up but the microphone that I have which I barely use but I probably should it's a condenser microphone SF-666 Pro. Great for a starting YouTuber which I am. Got it as a gift from my sis. Obviously I don't have a proper set up because I've been moving recently a lot so that's kind of not possible plus I don't really have a laptop either so I just been recording with my tablet or phone
Dan: I should get some weapons Me: YOU HAVE A CHILD DAN
Dan: this is the Logitech Herman Miller.... this is about 10 times better than any gaming chair Me: I think he's going to have something to say about his PewDiePie chair to counter that
Dan play anarcute again!
dantdm song ????????????????????????????????????????????????????/
I actually haven't seen his setup tour yet so this is going to be just as new for me as it is for you

'Boomer-ish' isn't realistically a word in the English language. Although I think you mean 'boomer'. Which is also not an accurate term.  A 'boomer' is somebody who was born between 1945-1948, during the baby boom after WW2.  After the Second World War, the men started coming back home to their wives after not being there for a long time. So when they got back a lot of people were having sexual intercourse, sometimes for the fun of it, but also because the war lasted years, and women were already thinking about having families before the war, so when they got back, after having a few years to prerelease, had decided to start a family. So no, a boomer is not somebody in their 30s.

GET THE WIDEEEEE DISPLAY
What you doing with the music stuff 🤔
Other house
Very interesting stuffs my man.
No it's good to have a monitor in a good position otherwise it really isn't good for your neck, same for any screen. I watch things on my tablet all the time, which means I'm looking down, cause it's in my lap, add that to being hunched over a desk for 5 hours+ a day and a super heavy school bag... Well you need to look after your neck. So for someone who's whole job is to game,a good monitor set up is key
Pls make a song again
Excuse me Mr. DanTDM. I'm for 1 going to be a youtuber soon thx for the inspiration from you. I am asking for some tips, and can you list everything you are using for your setup? I would really appreciate it, but you don't need 2. Thx for reading if u do. TheGamingkiller698

(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."

Tomdachi life
Guys reply all your fav tubers
Hey is it just me or is anyone else still waiting for Dan to do deltarune chapter 2
No way! I’m currently also using invisible braces. I know your pain Dan 👍
Nice video, it felt good that you went into the audio side, as that is my forté. I have to admit that I am extremely jealous of your ability to drop more than I get in a month on a chair.  I really need to get my finger out and get my music sold. I thought my career was started when I did the msuic for a game called Disastr_Blastr, but it kind of stalled when the game didn't perform as well as we had hoped. We had a couple of medium sized channels play it, but couldn't get the cream of the crop to join in.  I thought I was jelly enough of the Beyerdynamic HD1990 Pro headphones, but that pales into comparison with your audio setup.  I have an outboard rack of pro audio stuff, that is barely used, and a 2010 PC, with 16 ins and outs, for music production, gaming etc. I can't afford an upgrade due to issues I won't go into here, but I hope to get something along the lines of the Scarlett boxes for my next system as my PCI cards can't be used in modern PCI X only systems.  Anyway, all the best and keep up the good work.  Ps watched Free Guy with my kids and they loved seeing you in it, well done with that too.
Your monitor is a weapon Dan.
Hey dan, ever considering dropping a song :o
Dan is the one of the only people who can say my last name correctly
if u spend ur spare time doing music what about responding to endigo?
*keeheehee*
I'm sorry I got to be honest, the microphone makes your voice sound muffled
Dan says to subscribe and my sister thought you where talking to her so she subscribe and she said to me "if you don't subscribe something will happen".
when I watched pewdiepies vid, I did wonder if Dan would talk about it in his next vid XD
lol
Lmaoooooo nice

John 3:16 [16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  John 14:6 [6]Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Matthew 18:11  For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.  John 8:12 [12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.   Matthew 4:17  From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  Romans 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  Luke 13:3 [3]I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.  Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.   Luke 6:27-38 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,  6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.  6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.  6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.  6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.  6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.  6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.  6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.  6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.  6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.  6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:  6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.  Matthew 5:2-12 King James Version 2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.  Matthew 24:4-14  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows. 24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. 24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.   ....,,,,....,,,,....,,,,....,,  ......,,,,,,...........,,,,

Oh so if you're doing more music then where's Never Ever Going to the Nether remastered??
I use a shotgun mic for my videos and streams, and let me tell, it WORKS a CHARM! I love it as it was very cheap and I get very high quality audio. If you did vlogging and you have a shotgun mic hanging around, use that for your videos. The sound is amazing!
“I’ve got no weapons” Me: So you don’t own pugs?

Can't wait to see PewDiePie react to this
Just cut a hole in your pc and put your camera there, then it can be eye level!

I’m gonna use boomer neck as an insult now lol
Mr dante do you believe me if i say i fount your double gengar in my country and he is you tuber to
Dan you NEED to make another read your comments song?
clickbait
What about MR. BEAST!
Btw Dan that monitor is called the odyssey neo
we won't make you cry dan don't worry
I'm reacting to Dan reacting to Pewds reacting Dan
You deserve more
dont make dan cry
I watched that vid and knew this was coming
If you see this man "OwO" call me he has a bounty of 10.000.000
What is your monitor dan?????
He won't becoz his desk is lifted
Dan don't get weapons you have pugs
*B O O M E R N E C K*
do you use luigi in mario rabbids
I love u
Dan you don't need another weapon in your room, you already have all those guitars. They're good for hitting robbers in the head
LoL 😂
Tbh dan should react to kreekcrafts setup
Dan Simpin on pews confirmed lol
I have my monitor at eye level
Never expected dan to suddenly appear so close to the camera, what a jumpscare xD 2:55
"We need some more weapons" _next video we see a shotgun hanging on the wall, a mid evil battle axe leaning in the background, and a big minigun mounted on the wall I the background_
What was that
Robots, bigger screens, and more weapons.
Dan caring about his longterm health? What kinda video IS this???
Commenting on this before PewDiePie comments
I swear I heard Dan say the s word
Dan: "I need to get more weapons." Me, for some reason: DANTDM GUN
dear dantdm I am getting braces soon and I'm scared but to hear that you didn't have to worry about getting braces I'm less scared and more confident to get braces.
blue pewdiepie???
Pewdiepie should react to Dan reacting to his reaction of Dan's video
"Keheeheee" -Dantdm
:Dantdm I need weapons: after explaining to get a shotgun microphone
Out of all the channels ive ever watched your audio is the absolute best.  Flamingo should take notes because his mic is just the worst of the worse with no leveling and doesn't auto tune to minimize outsburst screams and its terrible. Or his editing does a bad job. Camt watch him anymore because we have to constantly change the volume when his girl scream starts.
2:00 No, ur right dan, it is annoying 6:50 just get a wire sorter (idk what they’re actually called)
Other house?
i keep my monitor low because i'm short. i keep my chair adjusted as high as it goes..
Don’t get weapons you’ll turn American
maybe dont get some weapons... what would asher do with them????
Vocals I hear?    Song with endigo?   👀👀👀
Oh no… HE’S CRYING YOU NEED TO SUBSCRIBE!!!!!
Hi Dan I've been A fan for maybe 4 years now (ik I'm not really an og). But I would literally melt if I get a hi from you Dan!😁
wide monitor
Dan what headphones do u use and suggest
Weapons? Asher will be wielding them
Is this a sponsor or what..?
congrats on 26M subs that the day of my birth!
YOOOO CONGRATULATIONS FOR 26 M
Hello dan, I’m your one of your biggest fans, thanks too you I started my own channel, you have been one of the few bright lights to direct me. Thank you
I remember watching old fnaf videos when I was really young and when he had old hair
change ur set up
Dan: Shotgun microphone   Also Dan literally 30 seconds later: I need more weapons. I have zero weapons.
Ey, when dantdm book 2 coming?
day 5 of asking dan to make more hardcore season 2   👁👄👁
Great reaction Dan. Love your content and how amazing it is. Great video
“I’ve only used a curved monitor once and I own one now, at my other house” - Dan
I saw guitars and now we need Dan to play the 14 string guitar!
get the wide monitor!!
Dan you need to make a video on your guitars that would be awesome
Pewdiepies new trend is messing wo+ith youtubers lol
Why do I remind me of ed shearin
asher will kill u with the sword
Dan, you need to make more music related videos, please.
YOOOO DAN I GOT THE INVISALIGN TOO
Pewds next video: reacting to DanTDM reacting to me reacting to his setup
I saw a throat nut in pewds neck
Pewdiepie searched up mischief in Japanese because Tsuki mart is releasing a new collection called mischief I think :D
While it was likely a joke, Dan I would recommend trying out a bowstaff for a weapon.
The crossover of the century!
Camera and monitor placement are honestly key factors of a gaming setup.
Me knowing Ill never have this 🏆
9:42 HE HAS 2 HOUSES ????
This video is a combo, if you noticed in the video in our pov we were watching 3 videos in 1
GET THE WIDED MONDER
Hi
I’ll take all the stuff you don’t use 😂
WE NEED MORE WEAPONS (pro gamer tip 2022)
PewDiePie IS so mean
Ware are go make a noder music video
"I have 0 weapons, I need some weapons"
Legend reacting to another legend reacting to the legend....Absolute legend!
I’ve been watching for about 8 years
Love you Dan if you read this
Hi Dan
Hi
dan at the beginning "teeheehee"
What headphones do you have?  Edit:if anyone knows pls reply
Hey DanTDMan can you do some bedwars or any hypixel I loved them videos
him: you should keep back and neck straight parents:  you should keep back and neck straight me: *dosen't listen to parents.* also me: *listens to dan*
Us: so he is reacting to himself in someone else’s video Dan: I am reacting to pewdiepie reacting to me
Dan… make. A. Song…
If you have seen DanTDM in real life, you would know he already doesn’t have the best neck
When is the diss track that your going to make lol
Dan's clickbaiting skills are getting better
Yes dan you must get yourself some weapons and robots. I want to see that. XD
That little 'kEEhEeeEehEEEee'
I’ll buy that goxlr Dan lol
If you’re not using that Shure sm7b I’ll gladly take it
Lol
You don't need much to start gaming,I just use my laptop to play games and it's great(apart for the fan noise),no need for ultra expensive gaming PCs unless you have the money to waist or you're a proffessional gamer.
ess essssssssssssssss
PLEASE PLAY BLOONS TD 6 PLS :)
Me: One black spaghetti please DanTDM: coming right away 6:40
DanTDM's setup quality is what I aspire to have, I need sunglasses for all my bright lights 😂
when will you play fortnite again??
1:01 Dan you know what people are going to do with this, right?
Lol, I agree, DanTDM is has go to have the best neck in YouTube. That neck be THICK. 🤣
Good for you dantdm
Pewds:“He got that sparkle in his eyes” Dan:HeeHeeHeee
Balls 🥎🧶⚽⚾🎱🏀🔮🏐
This is crazy its kinda hard to think about hes watch that guy watch him while were watching him
Can you put it in between??
Dan? You have 2 houses??????
He got that sparkle
Cool
WHAT'S WITH THESE BOT HATE COMMENTS IF U HATE DANTDM AND SAY THE N WORD WHEN U SHOULDNT I HOPE UR PILLOW GETS COLD
2:35 dan: “three” hand: four
Hearing that Dan used a fairly cheap PC to render videos is both wholesome and amazing.  I bought a system for £40 and upgraded the RAM to 32GB and added a 1060 6GB if I remember correctly and that was for fun and nerdy purposes :D
So....do y'all know about the 'meme' incident? I don't wanna ruin it...but at some point PewDiePie posted a meme about the Holocaust. And wouldn't take it down.
Other house?
dan!!! please play don't starve again
Dan say this comment. Sssssssssssssssssssssuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuppppppppppppppppppp
Is a bm 800 microphone good?
Dan, implement the wide screen LOL
6:37 as a gamer, that disgusts me
DANIEL [insert middle name here] MIDDLETON... IS THAT A IBANEZ SA SERIES? Same as mine :)
Can you please make a nostalgic vídeo about MCSM (Minecraft Story Mode)? Please!!!!!!!!!
Hi

F for cables.
Yesss! Exactly I have a shotgun mic for a reason

1:00 LITERALLY ME EVERYTIME SOMEONE COMPLIMENTS MY CONTENT
Dan why do you need two houses
1:52 agreed
5:35 - Dan either edited that **MASSIVE** head, or he just has one (2nd option recommended)>
Dan should fight KSI and use the money from the fight to buy a wide screen monitor
I already know he was gonna react to this
DanTDM is gonna have the best neck in the industry!
YOU SHOULD GET A BLUE LIGHTSABER! SO ALL THE HATERS WON'T BE COMING AT YOU!
Hey dan Idk if this might help but you could always put the camera between the monitors (between your main one and the one that you use to read chat or have obs open on)
@pewdiepie
You do music now
I've heard those giant curved monitors tend to go out after a year or so... so is it really worth having?
it is a G9 monitor
Nice vid DanTDM and PewDiePie

DanTDM wants to evolve! *dun dun dun* DanTDM Has evolved! He is a computer nerd now.
Why does pewds always comment on other Youtubers
He does music!?!?!?! Dan! What about Endigo! (That's his name right?)
DanTDM: Turns a 21 minute video into a 11 minute video Matpat: Turns a 10 minute video into an hour long video
Hey look endingo new videos
Baby boy said maaaaannnnn imma make myself get another pair of glasses by turning off the lights and opening my brightness on my pc to 100%
Moment of silence for the custom DanTDM gaming chair 😔
11:25 I don't think it would be very good to have a sword that Asher could access
You've been Pewdapproved  And you need a robot that's holding weapons
Do it
I wonder if we will see Dan using the robot arms the next time he does another setup tour?
2:30 ok Dan is now just flexing xD

Legend but “at my other house” is crazy
i watched the pewdiepie vid
that microphone costs more than my left kidney
I made this comment 59 minutes after the video
You know what I always say about you? "He makes those really great Disney Theme park videos"   This is because I have you confused with Disney Dan and  TPM Vids and in side my head I have confused every thing and have credited you for the completely wrong subject.
i dont know why pewdiepie has so much subs, he probably bought half of them because he sucks. i hate his videos they are humiliating
Idea: Make A YouTube account for Songs
Bro there was a pug on his old gaming chair
We need a dantdm guitar showcas
“i should get more weapons” no dan, pewds is a bad influence on you
The title made me audibly gasp.
"I hope this was interesting" Dan that adorable embarrassed giggle 1:00 was literally all I needed to be happy today thank you

11:23   Dan: Mabye I should get more weapons   Us: Dan I think your forgetting someone……………..Asher

😊
When you are really early-
Switch it up again
You know it’s a fire video when u can’t stop laughing
i know this is random but i might die because of war near my country. Hope to still be able to watch this amazing human being even at my worst time
I can't stand seeing mics in the view frame either...and then they're always subconsciously leaning into it to talk 🤷🏼‍♀️  To me it looks awkward and crowded so it's uncomfortable to watch.
LOVE UR VIDS BTW
manz has his monitor high and mic low for comfort and thats amazing cause most just do what sounds and looks best
Maybe next pewdiepie will react to Dan watching pewdiepie?
who else is waiting for him to react to Endigo's song for him?
funny how I still watch the minecraft hardcore channel

U need another gun!!!🤣
Eww, pewdiepie?!?  He's litteraly one of my top hated youtu ers along with Sundee.
