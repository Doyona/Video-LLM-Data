Don't care what people think I just voted for what I wanted, if cry babies care that much about losing a vote oh well.
they always vote for the shittiest mobs, just give me anything except glowsquid and that stupid sniffer
honestly i hate how in mob votes, the other mobs are just cancelled
Yes they are useless
I think the problem is that it exists. Just don't do a mob vote period. If you have cool mob ideas, just share them with the community and add them to the game. Don't leave choices of features up to the players, and as anti choice as it might seem, when it comes to game dev letting the community decide a feature isn't a great idea. Take feedback and widly believed facts about a feature and use it to improve and enhance, not completely decide the games future features. Thats all I have to say, didn't even need to watch the video to answer the question. Yes, the mob vote has a problem. It IS the problem.
Мои рекомендации сошли с ума т.к. дублирует этот ролик в ленте...
I feel like instead of completely scrapping the losing mobs forever they should simply implement them last. Because who didn't want the iceoleger as  well
I'm still salty about dream guy rigged the last mob vote
The biggest problem with it is that the biggest fans are the ones who've been here since day one and are in their 20s by now. But the majority of the fanbase now is newer kids picking up the game who are no older than 16. The game and the votes are no longer in our hands. Especially when 90 percent of the fan base is now under 12 and vote for whatever looks the coolest. Ooh dino yay I love dinos....
Its not in minecraft  bro
We need a programmable golem that copies your actions and then you can walk away and let it do it's thing. Tired or mining? Golem will do it for you. Tired of farming? Golem will do it for you.
I LOVE allays. I use them as hunting dogs, essentially. They’re one of my favorites. I seek them out early, as at night I usually stand on my tower and shoot all the mobs around my base for a while, and they collect the arrows from the strays and skeletons. I also often have them set to collect string from spiders, or if I’m hunting chickens I’ll set them to chicken and feathers,etc so I don’t have to go around and collect all my stuff.
dont blame mojang for adding these mobs its not to them its to the community they make 3 diffrent mobs and the players get to vote witch one they want   its truely childish to start arguing and complaining cuz the mob you wanted isnt in the game.  in other words just accept the mob they add and if you want the mob they didnt add download mods..
minecraft should put in all the mobs
Your problem is that you don’t have an accurate view of the world. You’re not a “community”, you’re a self-selected consumer market for Microsoft. Your “vote” is a means for them to target their product for consumption.
i think the sniffer doesnt fit the colors and feeling of overworld minecraft
I really wanted tuff golem to win man. Every mob doesn't need a use, that little guy is just cute. Doesn't need anything anything else.
Good job , were gonna have a mob that finds seeds now
allays are cool but... Have you ever actually seen one ingame?
It's the weebs and furries voting for retarded mobs so they have a mob they can relate with
Wait, y'all mfs voted for seed guy over the guy who gives you tools?
It just digs up seeds?
The biggest thing probably is just the disappointing lack of use for the potential many of these mobs have had. Almost all of them have been rather baseline concepts and have seen little expansion past that when they did get implemented. The Phantom I feel is the biggest victim of this. I'd go as far to say I'd have voted for it myself if I was involved with the community around then - it looked like it would've been a cool vampiric feeling night threat and had a lot of potential to both have a kind of beauty to how it mightve looked and offered something unique in a fight, being a flying threat that wouldn't rely on projectiles. Sadly as we all know this didn't come to be. It ended up being more of a nuisance than anything, even to players who would WANT them to spawn since they have to wait 3+ ingame days for that to be possible at all. Wasted potential is absolutely holding these mobs back. The base concepts that get put on the slate feel very bare, and I find it hard to see interest in any of them more and more as new votes are set. I'm of course biased more for hostiles since those will be engage and reward cases, but knowing you have to hunt the sniffer out will make it probably a bit more enticing for me too. It's better than basically being a passive mob like the glow squid, or like moobloom probably would've been.
Sniffer is super cool
Or just add them all
Mob vote needs to be changed to the winning mob being implemented 1st and the others being implemented in other updates I saw someone suggest 2 or 3 updates of the other mobs which I find is fair cause the other mobs fully deserve to be in the game I'd love a copper golem or a tuff golem running around my base such potential wasted
James 3:10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. (.Also Jesus is king God is king.)
Still mad about the moobloom 😒
Who else thinks the sniffer's eyes are the nostrils
The problem is all the ideas were trash
i dont see nothing wrong with it.
Make it so you’re not allowed to comment on your choice as a content creator. It’s just unfair to the community
the rascal drops the ancient pickaxe. it has the same durability as a netherite pickaxe, comes with enchants eff 8 and unbreaking 3.
why mojang cant add all them
tuff golem dabs at 5:56
Nobody wants to be given several choices, to then only receive one. It’s dissatisfying to lose the vote. Even if your mob wins the vote, it’s a little dissatisfying knowing that the other mobs could have been in the game and wondering “what if”.
I feel that minecraft youtubers ruined the mob vote
it sniffs
Duuuuude how are people not voting for the Rascal!?!?😩😩😩
All 3 are really cool in their own way and make the world feel more alive so hopefully one day they’ll all be added
I say they need a vote for some other feature to be added in.  The tuff golum is worseless and will problem be the one voted for.
I find it funny that the Minecraft community is already regretting their vote (people making videos that the mob vote is a problem), and the mob isn't even out yet.
There are not loosing or winning votes. Just an illusion of decision..they are all bad, and players doesn't vote for things that matters
I Had This Idea For The Rascal  So In His Code He Can Know If The Player Is On Early Game Or In End Game , Depending On What Kind Of Game The Player Is , He Would Give More Amateur Equipment Like An Iron Pickaxe Or Better Equipment Like An Enchanted Diamond Pickaxe  This Would Also Affect The Duration And Difficulty Of The Hide And Seek Minigame
Multi-billion company cant add all 3 mobs each time? pathetic
Finally a dinosaur in Minecraft
Personally I think the issue is that they should have enough people to just add all 3 choices. Makes the Minecraft devs look pretty lazy
I feel like the last couple mob votes have been designed to have a favored winner.   The Allay was a mob they admit was originally designed for legends, and they wanted to bring it into Java. It had the most "lore" behind it, a clear mechanical foundation, and a design that looked finished.   With the Sniffer, it was the only one of the three to have lore attached to it, it was the only one that would provide new blocks/decor (plants), and it was the most "finished" looking design of the three.   Honestly, I'd prefer it if Mojang would just add the mobs they want, rather than giving us these meaningless votes.
I don't like the mob vote, just add them all to Minecraft! It's a multi millón dollar Game, it can afford to put the 3 mobs... If mod creators can make mods with hundreds of mobs they can make 3
I mean, the fact that the Allay spawn in cages in Illager mansions and look like Vex, who themselves have had scars/stitches across their body since their initial implementation and are summoned by the Illagers (Evoker), I'd say the Allay adds some pretty decent lore; especially as their design hints they could just be genuine spirits of the dead. Slightly dark lore but have you heard some of the unnamed disks? Yeesh.
Me: Why not add all the Mobs that didn't get voted? Mojang: *Your Life trial has expired*
I feel like it was decided in advance which mob was going to win by making it _better_ than the other choices (e.g. new plants and overworld gameplay easily trumps what was shared about the other options).
Y’all so pressed about a mob lmfao it’s just a game 😹
I don't really play this game but still powerful script as always!
F*cking dream man
Perhaps the Rascal could be added in as a reskin of the Wandering Trader with either a rare percentile chance of being a Rascal when a Wandering Trader spawns, or by having it spawn in place of a Wandering Trader when the player is deep underground and in conditions that might otherwise spawn a wandering trader.
The thing is... All of them ready mobs, But they're just waste away becouse "Community" vote thing... He used his time for those creatures and watching them go away? It feels weird to me... They all of them has a purpose to live. And each one of them is diamond for us... But just 1 mob? I dunno man... It feels cheap, Mods can add 100 of them with 1 package so why bother playing vanilla, If you got modded?
Should still nerf the phantom
I WANT SNIFFER TO WIN ITS SO CUTE
i am so happy for sniffer
The biggest problem with mob vote is... that it is a vote.  They already spend so much time on designing the mobs, so they should add all 3.  Modders already proved that it takes maybe 1-2h for each mob while you know the design and what it'd do  So... adding just one is a lot of time wasted that they've already spent on other 2 mobs.  But adding all 3 would require just few more hours of work.  And... MC really need more variety of mobs, as sometimes it feels just empty, or everywhere every mob is the same.
I feel like they should remove the mob vote since Mojang itself has had great ideas and they know Minecraft better than us. So I feel they should decide because they know which ones will be fun to play with or just be useless to us
Rascal Was Gonna Be Useful
Still mad about the fact that people chose a glowing squid over a Frost mage which can drop an Ice staff. Like what the heck?
I just want dragons to finally get added it would be so cool if you could randomly come across a dragon in the over world or in the neither even baby dragons or different types like the more serpent like dragons appearing in the ocean or climbing to the top of a mountain and finding a nest maybe we could even tame them but they could be difficult to so you really have to earn it
It’s existence is a problem, all the mobs already have well made designs, Mojang could easily add them all, also YouTubers can easily rig the vote by saying which one they want in the game and all their followers will vote for that mob, kk, now I’m watching the video
the Tuff Golem was bound to be epic compared to the others. What the heck man? It was so cool! Now we have a mob that adds new plants to the game. That's the only reason people wanted the Sniffer. Cuz "new plants". the Tuff Golem could have been a really cool display mob. :(
thx brо realy worked
And I forgot to vote
If you don’t vote you don’t get any new mobs
The problem is that each an every single candidate is stupid
Literally this video had no opinions from the creator, just clickbait
Interesting
I need rascal in Minecraft or tuff golem but I don't need sniffer in Minecraft.
My husband is a very "technical" minecraft player as he is all about Redstone and renewable everything and mega farms, I'm a very "aesthetic" minecraft player as I basically immediately start building and decorating and terraforming everything and that's just what I do. So with the mob votes many of them I vote for what he thinks is best because I don't much care for a golem that presses buttons or a living mannequin (?). We both voted for the sniffer soley for the possibly of New plants and it was a very easy decision. I honestly think the majority of the times the options just aren't great, but that may just be to my play style.  Side note:  I'm still upset we didn't get the flower cow.
I love the sniffer i wanted it from the start. Nothing I ever vote for wins before Sniffer so yea. and the other 2 was kind of bleh but this one is suppose to add more then the other two we already have stuff to move items around out base redstone and if you cant handle your choice not winning then its not very mature. Plus the new mob makes other people happy and every choice is not the center of the universe.
I voted the sniffer aswel
Honestly what blows my mind the most is just the fact that they still haven't made a sequel that is exactly the same but runs on it's own new gen engine.  It's like if Sega had just used the original sega sonic engine to create sonic generations by just slightly updating the engine... It doesn't make sense. I mean ray tracing etc is cool but like,... What?
There was literally NO REASON for Tuff Golems not to win. Tuff is a TOTALLY useless block. It can't be used for decoration, since it looks worse than any other block in the game, it stops you from getting ACTUALLY useful blocks, and it's currently not used to make anything. If you put something other than TUff Golems in, Tuff should be removed the same patch.
It's also important that they don't just put every mob in the game that we can vote for. That would make minecraft feel bloated. Atleast to me.
I really hope they’ll still add the Rascal later down the line, as the idea of playing Hide and Seek for prizes sounds really fun!
heres soomething yal dont know u could repair elitra with leather befor the phatome as a thing
WE WANT RASCAL
And here I thought the problem was that there's no reason not to add all mobs.
Sniffer rightfully won and always should have. All those who disagree are heretics/fake news/dont exist. I will take questions.
I wanted the rascal
i think this vote was hugely unbalanced. at least 2 new plants and a new mob, vs a hide and seek friend, or a statue friend. One promised extra rewards so of course people voted for the one with MULTIPLE new things instead of the other 2 with only one new thing (the mobs themselves) sorry if i phrased this badly.
I want to say, yes yes yes yes, this is such a big problem, they have Microsoft 's backing, and even if they doesnt, they are one of the best selling games of all time. This is supposed to be "the community have a vote to put anything" but if a big content creator said something would be added, everyone else that wanted to add a different one a next to none chance to add it. Pratically all of the mobs from the vote are useless. And please just adds more mobs or have a way for the community to test it other than one thing that is redundant and help no one besides the people that speaks the game's code as a language. This is feeling so out of touch from Mojang to their community, specially with the whole "report" thing awhile back
Phantom membrane was added before 1.14 villagers. So getting mending was a lot more difficult, either make an AFK fish farm and leave your computer for days, or make a villager breeder and sift through trades by hand. Both very tedious and I doubt many casual players would have done them, compared to the somewhat less tedious task of finding elytra. That said, manually repairing tools means incurring an increasing repair penalty, which is a great way of incentivising using 1.14’s cheap trade mechanics and destroying game balance. It’s a feature.
I feel the sniffer has a lot of potential tbh. Like what if one of the seeds was like a jack and the bean stalk type of thing where if you climbed it it would take you to like a new realm or something kinda like the aether. I believe Mojang said they’re not gonna add any more dimensions but it could be like a bunch of new biomes for like a sky update. Maybe when you plant the beanstalk seed it would spawn the sky world above you or something and it could have ancient people/creatures. But that might be too complicated for them to add but it would be cool
I think that when they reveal those mob I think they should add all of them , the game would grow faster and the feeling of a new update and bigger than before would make Minecraft grow even more!
some sectors of the minecraft community would be mad that we aren't receiving enough information about the mobs in future mob votes if we implemented your strategy. I agree with you, just saying.
WAIT, SOME JACKASSES ACTUALLY WANTED THE PHANTOM IN THE GAME!? Bet you all have Voter's remorse now!
The mob vote is pretty much decided when popular mcyts give their opinion We all know certain communities (cough cough _dream_ cough) will drop their individual thoughts and vote like a hivemind
I feel the idea of having the mobs coming into the game with more than what was stated at the announcement, while fun in concept, would likely lead to mob votes causing even more arguments then they already do.  If the standard people come to expect is that there will be more then what is in the trailer, then people will get even saltier when their pick didn't win due to mechanics they may have just assumed their choice would come with. And it would even cause a new problem of people being upset even if their choice won, if the surprise mechanic isn't what they expected.  Of course, this problem applies much less if they are updated after they have already been added, and only for those that need it. Like the glowsquid (and regular squid honestly) could use some way of interacting with their environment instead of just being floating bags of resources.
Its not a real voting system.... its free pretend development for free praise on parts of the game that never happen.
To be honest the sniffer has a couple things to bring it to shame in this case though. The sniffer is kiiinda useless
I ma actually so sad that we didn’t get the tuff golem
Bad clickbait, I assumed this would be a critique. Really you just stuffed the video with other people work and made a dime off it.
nah the tuff golem maybe
I'm tired of new mobs. I just want the game to work correctly on xbox. I have lost dozens of worlds with a year or more of play time in them. Their customer support is useless and keeps referring me to Microsoft who refers me back to Mojang. The problem is linked to cloud saving and I have no options to turn it off or create local backups. I made 12 backup saves of one world and they all corrupted at the same time because the cloud syncing affects all saves every time you save the game.  Even when the game does work correctly I'm tired of constantly having to rebuild my iron farm every update because they keep making small tweaks that break it. (I don't mind rebuilding ever but they tweak so often I end up having to start again before I'm even finished sometimes.) I'm tired of the cascading shadow bug that's existed for years. I'm tired of minecarts being constantly tweaked. (same problem as the iron farm.) I'm mostly tired of corrupted worlds. I don't need new mobs. I don't even want to play anymore because I'll randomly lose months of work for no reason. Enough gimmicks. Fix the game.
plese the sniffer not the rascal seems like a racoon
This might pretty much defeat the purpose of mob votes but I was thinking about trials to test out the mobs? You click a button, spawn into a random world, and are given free reign to try out a mobs abilities in game. Then the votes. If a mob wins the vote, the devs could fine tune the concept out later instead of having the trial version being set in stone. On the other hand this may lead to some very dissapointed people
The contest in which the majority of times they've had it, some large Minecraft youtuber has had the ability to influence the votes? From AntVenom to Dream? Flawed?
Please Mojan I need more tameable creatures please I’m begging you I need more interaction that isn’t random villager noises and made up insane conversations between me and the cows please ;——;
If you’re mad about sniffer being “useless” it’s just like many more vanilla mobs, like the polar bear and I don’t see no one complaining about it
I just want some new golems, man. You'd think in a game all about gathering resources and making things with them, creating animated statues would be on top of that list. There's an abundance of resources in the game we could use to make constructs, yet we can still only make two.
They shouldn't do it at all. Just implement all the mobs!
i think minecraft should just add all of the mobs, so everyone wins and gets happy
The rascal would be good for mid-game so then you get get an enchanted iron pickaxe earlier
Well I voted Tuff Golem,  but ____________________
One of these days i hope they make a “tying up loose ends” update, where they implement most if the promised or hinted at features from past mob votes and other places.
I hate mob voting, is an excuse to make less content and make people think they're being heard.
So far I feel like any of vote mobs implemented except glow squid feel out of place and not needed.
Rascal should've won
What if the community made a mob for minecraft
What the Phantom was voted into the game ... oh dear god what fools are voting here!
Anyone else had a problem with how bad the videos for mob votes sound? Like, how fake do you want it? Yes.
This year was first time thing I voted for one
Based on the last 2 mob votes  Mojang really wants a new golem😂
I think its better if it were just so that the winning mob gets added first, and then the other ones later. Like, can they really not code, model, animate, and make the noises for 3 mobs? nah thats impossible with their billions of dollars.
ok but S N I F F E R
i want the copper golem
I like the way those mob votes are, you get what you vote for. I don’t want to vote for a mob that I like and get something else than promised. Everyone has another concept in their mind, not only community and creator but each member of the community. This way you can be sure.  I’d also hate it if I didn’t voted for a mob that would be different than my expectations and even cooler than the one I voted for
i wanted rascal
I think they should add all of the mobs which didn’t make it or make more votes for the ones the community still wants to have
I just fail to understand why they make it a vote when mojang could just all the mobs and make the game even more interesting because of it
how did rascal lose?
Such shallow implementations to the game
Man I want the tuff golem. I’d like to have my place more alive with a wondering mob.
I wish they made new mobs easier to get. Still haven't seen an Allay or frog and restarted a couple of times 😕
The sniffer looks like the mosswine from mhw
cope
The sniffer is the worst mob out of all of them. It’s so useless all it does it get seeds which the person can easily do themselves
Sniffer is useless
The problem I have is that these mobs could all be added to some degree. No reason we couldn't have the Moobloom and Iceologer as they sounded like they would be very rare.
nobody cares about the allay lmao
if only it makes the sniffer cuter...
What bothers me is, that no one voted for the sniffer, but rather the new plants, the other two didn't promise new things beside themselves, which is really unfair.. add to that, that the voting community pretty much completely is decked out in their worlds with all the stuff that's already there and suddenly a enchanted iron pickaxe which likely would  just grant  existing enchants at random is essentially a non-feature and the golem to me sounded like a more annoying item frame, I wonder who'd win......
im telling you this, mojang needs a good and proper challenging new mob for the next mob vote in minecraft live 2023. also rest in peace icelooger (chillager)
They should add the vote feature in game when you click on the luncher the vote pops up for you to vote before you click on play if u didnt vote yet instead in twitter or god knows where i don’t follow Minecraft news that often but I’ve been playing it since 2013 till this day.
Thing is, people who are not designers shouldn't have a say on how to design the game to begin with, unless it is with very heavy guidance and a good amount of "fake choice". And the base game itself already has so many structural flaws and such a wildly inefficient development process that adding a yearly mob vote where the team produces 3 concepts that they know have each 66% chance of being disposed of, leading to them being very rudimentary ideas, leading to an already game-design uneducated audience having to decide based on very partial and/or vague info and the fantasies they project onto them, seems like a huge waste of resources AND a process unfit to produce quality game elements.  Minecraft development has always been about "add new shiny thing, never look at it again and announce new shiny thing", and rough ideas hardly ever get more lifespan than their "birth" update to develop properly so I doubt anything would really change without the mob vote, but at least don't let your team create mobs for nothing, at the mercy of consumer opinion. It's a fun event, but ultimately not a good idea.
I can't understand who the mobs in the past few votes have won. They're bad.
The sniffer won
Being vague as possible, is the key to omitting half the stuff. I mean at the end of the day, i really didnt' like the sniffer. Not that the other options were any day better, but yeah it makes sense as to why it was chosen  I hope it adds some game breaking type of plant. And yeah the sniffer in adult form should be ridable lmao
I really hope they hold something like a "runners up" vote for all the second place concepts. Or maybe just several mixes of previous concepts. It could I've them a much needed brain storming break down the line
I vote sniffer
I like the mobs vote but I feel like they should add all the mobs(while yes it takes a lot to code and do stuff like that I just wish it could be fair) in that are in these videos for other people to enjoy for example the sniffer won yes but people wanted the rascal or the golem it just doesn't seem fair to others
I really still want the copper golem no matter how useless it is
Or better yet, play Terraria. In the recent 1.4.4 Labor of Love update, the developers were continuously approving community ideas and suggestions through Reddit and Twitter. It was honestly too good to be true, like when Minecraft says that it aspires to please the community and utilise their feedback, that's what comes to my mind. Currently, Minecrafts "listening to th community" is just an extremely slow and broad process.
Tbh im still waiting for the firefly to appear in the game...
Simple solution, stop mob vote and only add one mob (do not introduce or even create the other 2 mobs)
Aayena shulker boxes better than bundles
I hate it how most people are salty just because the sniffer won
If the sniffer is prehistoric, I’m expecting more prehistoric game play hopefully fossils to come
Image Another mob Another cage set up
They give us a mob to vote for, people are unhappy with the vote and it divides the community.  Just work on a new mob and give us the new mob, that way less time is wasted by your creators on things that are never implemented, and more time spent in order to have a mob that fits better with the overall.  Thrust me, we don't not blame Minecraft for off mobs just because the community decided, because they never tell us everything about them, and wind up kinda bland or overly rare or annoying.
omg two years voting for golems, i just wanted these little dudes walking ramdonly in my base...
Sniffy boi won
we👏 need👏 a👏 end👏 update👏
thank you bro thank you
I'd love if they finished one update before trying to implement a new one..
We didnt know the phantom attacked players after not sleeping. They just said it was the terror of the night skys and we all thought a fly mob would be really interesting.
Just add em all lol
i really hate this mob votes they could add all 3 but they choose to do this so if you like a mob that is not popular in the vote well you´re out of luck
I just wanted the sniffer because I'm a farmer and I want new crops :)
Are bundles going to be in Minecraft 1.20? I heard they had to delay it by a bit but I'm not sure that its true
Can't they just add all the mobs it's not hard to make for them
I hope we get a mob vote that includes new bosses. Ive been wanting to see more bosses in the game that could add better to the lore and gameplay of Minecraft
Maybe they should announce what the update is and then let the community propose mobs for the update; just let the community up-vote the mobs until there are three clear winners, then have a vote between those mobs.
a problem? yeah a problem of bunch of whining hose who can't take an L from a democratic voting system
I want justice for the Moo Bloom
Those mob vote descriptions are just too vague, I just choose the least ugly/annoying ones everytime, if I want game changing mobs I just install mods
Sometimes i dont undestand mojang ,they have the art and the concept of all 3 mob so why dont just add all of them to the game
Why can’t we just have all 3!
I think that they should do a mob update that is comprised of some of the more popular runner ups from the mob vote
Quite frankly I'd just like them to go back and implement those mobs and biome changes they left out in the past. Desert changes, badland changes, iceloger, copper golems. Just because they didn't win doesn't mean we do t want them! I want my goddam palm trees! They've got them in dungeons for Steve's sake why not vanilla!?
Such an amazinh video. So helpful
To everyone who voted for phantoms: i hope your bed always has a crumb in it to annoy you.
Till this day I really HATE the glow  squid the Iceologers was great  for  the cliff and cave update  But no a certain youtuber had to use his influence on the community  To get a glow squid into the game
I want the villager painting
The problem is that every vote we get new beast. While sometimes the 2 who did not make it the last time are better as the 3 new ones.
They should 100% provide more info, only after I learned the plants were useless that I wanted the tiff golem
I don't get this mob votes, to me they should just show the mob and put all of them in the game since the mobs don't do much.
My problem with the vote is that the mobs are generally really boring lmao
Sniffer
Look the dev's are clearly railroading people with the mob vote. But I also understand that they're probably scared of splitting the comunity and disappointing people when their mob doesnt win.
IMO they should REALLY be upfront about what these mobs do / how they interact because it's extremely easy for people to hype themselves up for features that were never going to be part of the mob.  Also c'mon, this is Mojang, the Rascal would most likely just give you a level 1 enchanted iron tool and said enchant would be mediocre, meanwhile people were hyping it up as if you would be getting OP enchanted tools from it.
The sniffer feels like the only one that's kinda a bigger addition, something like the rascal and especially the tuff golem is so minor that they should just add it along with the update
I dont think that was hypnotise in the sense that it has the Power, but more that its so pretty that you just forget what you wanted to say
Honestly I feel like some bots were voting for sniffer because i saw like a bunch of the same messages
Still mad at everyone who voted for phantoms
Didn't 1.16 like JUST come out?!
I think the tuff golems would make a fine addition to the game if it were implemented with a new random structure, like a mage tower or an enchanter's library. Stepping in, you see those little guys running around, objects in hand, looking busy. I think the rascals could be good as well, like maybe instead of only a stone or iron pickaxe, the possibility of something good increases depending on what mining-based achievements you've earned. Not as impressed by the sniffers.
my whole problem with it is the fact it all feels pointless, like why not add all three or if one can only be add why not add one now and the rest later. a person on twitter gave me a decent reason why saying bedrock version could be reason for the whole thing but it all feels so wasteful. throw away all the work the team has done when the losing mob doesn't win just why. maybe I'm missing something but i feel their could had been a better community voting thing then mobs like small scale mods or something.
Finally what I wanted won
It’s just insane to me that a studio this size with this much money behind it refuses to make 3 mobs a year… there is absolutely 0 reason they can not just add all 3. We have to wait so long for updates in this game and it is so frustrating.
sniffer gang
What the heck,. I voted for the Sniffer and that is all it does?! I thought it will done more.. it looks like it will just stand and get seeds and that's it. Also will this thing even be breedable? These mobs are super disappointing what were they thinking.... We mostly want more animals to the game, they added penguins in other version game of minecraft, but why not the vanilla minecraft?
Why not just add all three? It would just be a waste of content if only one proceeded.
I blame dream and the dream stans. Once dream announces what he voted for, all the dream stans follow, making the mob vote no use whatsoever. Might as well just add all of them in. Me and my bro found out  ourselves. This is not a mere opinion.  Edit: All in all, I am glad an actually useful mob won the vote this year.
The mob voted was rigged
The answer is yes
the reason i'm not worried about this mob vote is that the rascal and tuff golem both become obsolete in a short amount of time  the rascal would help early game, get an item like a pickaxe to help mine for more iron or diamonds, but later on would just become a randomly occurring mob that players would likely kill if seen, with full diamond or netherite  the tuff golem would be nice for decoration, but doesn't really provide and benefits. players could also grief others by just killing them and taking the item they have  the sniffer would be good in all stages of the game, early for early seeds, late for farms. also, the size of them could be cool to see, since we don't have many big passive mobs in the game
Ever since Dweam I stopped caring about Mob votes.
So let me get it right, cause i was a little confused on your suggestion, they should not disclose mechanics of the mobs for the vote, or that they should?, IM not Sure. For Me the sniffer based on the info of this vid seems like the most likely to add depth to the game, if they seeds they add are usefull. if theyre not, then maybe the hide and seek dude wouldve been more usefull. And i Believe to know that if were adding game depth to the game the devs should release a decent amount of info about the mob. Now i do undertsand how lame it is to be spoiled about the birthday present before you can open it. But id rather have a somewhat memorable mob then a forgetable one.
No it does not
People forget the phantom membrane is also used in slow falling potions.
Adding one mob at a time is a stupid concept.
Now looking at it I think the Rascal would’ve been the best option- 1.17 gave new cave types, 1.18gave deeper worlds, 1.19 gave the warden and deep dark, why mention this? 3 updates for caves and mineshafts got nothing- new cave types, cave biomes, cave miniboss, 0 feature whatsoever for mineshafts- 1.20 could have given us a mob to make exploring a mineshaft more fun, as of now it s cave spiders which are annoying, and 1-3 minecart chests with meh loot- but no, people want cute over functionality or gameplay- tell me honestly how many of you spend hours of your gameplay with seeds and plants? Answer- none of you, no one spends much time with flora- now how much time do you spend decorating a build or mining? Exactly- people spend 5 minutes with flora, and hours if not days with the other 2, makes sense to have a mob to make those a bit more fun and random
You know what they should do who ever wins the mob vote should get all the other mobs abilities
I swear I have blocked this guy a million times and this video keeps popping up in my recommendeds please shut up 😭
They need to make it so you can turn off phantoms without turning on cheats
They really should stop making elections in Twitter. That is not a good platform where to make such things.
You no this mf voted tuff golem and now he salty 😮
Don't think that not giving all the information up-front on the mob you're voting for is a particularly good idea, makes it rife for speculation and people repeatedly getting their hopes up for mobs to be certain things that they end up not then getting angry at Mojang about it. Giving a feature-complete overview before the vote prevents this, and it's on them if this necessarily makes some options more appealing than others
The sniffer kinda looks like a doggo too
It's sad that the best selling game of all time Can't afford to add more than one creature a year. These should all be in the game, instead, Minecraft Dungeons gets all of the amazing things that could actually flesh out the Overworld and make it feel truly alive.
stupid, why can't they add animals to the damn savannas and other areas. instead they put stupid crap no one asked for into the game. hur dur you got a frog but it can't eat lightning bugs because muh realism.
rascle
Who dose not want the allay cuz i don't well it won because of DREAM AND HIS FANS
i dont like these votes mostly cause i dont like the mobs chosen. im all for new mobs but making us chose our poison instead of giving us all 3 is lame when they end up being like the glow squid
I voted for the Sniffer this year but there's a reason it got over 50% of the total vote. I personally thought the sniffer was the least interesting of the bunch but with the addition of additional cosmetic plants to the game how could you not vote for it? Instead of just getting the mob you also got new items which made the voting unfair IMO.
It would not let me vote at all when I tried to vote  i had planned to vote rascal  I didn't try the other options because i knew it let me vote sniffer  As well as the golem is stupid there isnt enough trophies to display and it's just a walker item frame that gets lost we have armor stands and a couple types of item frames I tried for a few hours even tweeted at Mojang about it it's worse especially after i spent ages wasted to migrate my old account with it giving me errors a few times and id have to start over
Alleys are so broken.  Iv never found one that worked properly
The sniffer is so adorable
People are choosing the most useless mobs ever though. Like the glow squid, yeah we get to make stuff glow but like…a squid?
I feel like the actual implementation of the mobs have been lackluster rather than it being connected to how the announcement for the voting has been handled. The info given at time of announcement seem vague on purpose for development reasons, however it just ended up being basically all that for the mobs added so far. That could have several reasons.   The mobs chosen turned out to be not actually that good additions to the game in terms of depth, which could be based on bias by the devs or how we the audience chose the mobs based on the information given. It is a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy because maybe the mobs voted tend to be mobs that are the coolest in visual and initial idea rather than the potential impact they could have on the game.   I am saying this as someone who generally voted for all the mobs which ended up being added so I can't exclude myself from this ill judgement. Best example for that is probably the glow squid, which is basically just a recolored squid, which I was a huge fan of just by the possible ambience it would give to certain underwater areas and the new cave system proposed back then.  However it impact on the gameplay is almost non existent except giving an upgrade to sign and itemframes - there are upgrades not alternatives/options in my opinion. I believe them to be superior in most cases, which means the old signs and itemframs could have just been updated or rather that feature is not really impactful nor does it benefit from being linked to the Glow Squid itself.  In that regard I think mobs like the rascal are unpopular due to the fact that it is hard to believe/imagine what impact they could have in the game. I myself feel like they would be just a gimmick just might find the cool the first time you encounter one, but after that forget for 99.9% of your gameplay. It smells like those "hidden mechanics" you see in top ten videos for older games.  I also believe that generally speaking based on general bias, mobs that are less anthropromorphic or what's it called will be prefered. Human like in any sort of definition will always come across too vague to make a proper impression. Both the rascal and the Tuff Golem as shown in the short animations in the beginning brought an immediate joke about them being creepy, while I don't think that is part of the core behaviours or how they are meant to be perceived, but that is how humans react to human like non human entities - with a few exceptions of course that are already predefined in our head like Snow Mans and Fairies based on a stronger impression we already have of them.  I don't think there is an actual solution to this problem. I think the idea of the glow squid is great. Have a feature that has an actual impact on the game and try to find a mob that best fit into that feature or around it and it will inevetiably make an impact on the actual game. The glowsquid failed because we didn't spend much more times in caves compared to what I believed we would and that it is still somewhat unlikely that you will see them spawn in said caves when just going about your business. I don't see any implementations where Phantoms would be anything else but annoying but as you highlighted the fiber is not worth it in any way. if you could consume the fibres to break your fall they would have an impact but brewing into potion first looks it to your progression after the nether which is fine for the enderdragon fight but maybe a similar effect but heavily nerfed could have been used similar to the ender fruits - but instead of teleporting to a random location give you slow falling for 3-5 seconds.
Can they make the sniffer rideable
Your face is so ugly that even a bug would puke if they saw it
Rascal better, why they choose this lmao.
Tbh I think the devs just want a new golem at this point
I voted for "add all of them you lazy bastards"
I do really love the ally tho its adorable
They should bring back forgotten mobs and make the community choose from them
i just vote on the ones i find cute i- and i always love having more trees and plant options, so you can probably guess what one i’ve voted for
The issue isnt within the votes, its the votes, with the resources mojang have at their disposal and thats all they can do with it? Laziness and greed.
Why can't the mob vote be a bit more interest, like instead of just 'normal' mobs, maybe introduce a new boss mob into the mob vote.
If u want sniffer  👇
my problem with the hostile mob roster is that there aren't many Overworld mobs who aren't humanoid. what i hope we get - besides the Red Dragon - is a Dracolizard. the Phantom's boring? i have come up with two options.  *option 1) the Dracolizard:* a mob that uses the same model, but it's twice the size of the Phantom, it appears in all biomes, breaths fireballs and drops its wing membrane, which repairs Elytras. what? might as well replace the Phantom with a mob that's an actual threat and that we can battle anytime. *option 2) the Wyvern:* same model as the Phantom, wing membrane that repairs Elytras... but the model would be twice as big as the Phantom (like the Dracolizard), has the Ender Dragon's wings (the shape, i mean), spits venom and appears in all biomes (again, like the Dracolizard).  i'm just pitching ideas for a better Overworld hostile mob.
Imagine if the Sniffer was added to the game? Now, imagine what if the Cow was removed?  Both are seemingly boring animals, but without the Cow, huge chunks of the game, like enchanting, are unusable.
yes it does. it obviously does.
the sniffer sounds like it has the most storyline implications
Wtf do u mean not the lack of good choices bro all the choices are horrible mobs like the phantom but instead of annoying the new mobs would be boring af this new update is boring af
my main problem is every time I see he mob options my usual thought is "wow more clutter". in earlier versions mobs added always had some kind of use usually multi and tied to useful gameplay aspects. the new mobs however usually have a very niche reason to be added but fill the world. We now have a bunch of animals and almost all of the new ones do...not much they just exist.
Yeh, it's not appening
I voted for the glow squid because there is a creature in subnautica who put a player in a hipnosis state and tries to bite him I tought that the glow squid would be similar (Sorry for the errors)
Tbh we have a huge impact on the game compared to other games
They're pointless. They need to just add all 3 mobs. Someone already modded all 3 in, If they don't have the ability to do the same with the source code and whatever 1000s of employees they have somethings very very wrong at Mojang and they need to do better
Vanilla players: MOM MY MINECRAFT VOTE DIDNT WINNN REEEEEEEEEEEEE Modded minecraft players:🥱
They should just hold the vote and announcement on the same day so that players cant be influenced by youtubers. I feel like the sniffer won exclusively because of youtubers
Imagine having to vote for mobs when ALL should be added
No matter what I am happy we got the Sniffer
Yes it does have a problem, It is sad to see so many concepts be thrown away  or put into other games. Minecraft as a whole is a bit barebones even with the new updates, this game could use newer variations of mobs like in dungeons. But the mob votes have always been swayed into the useless eye appealing mobs and it almost always has been influenced by creators one way or another. Mojang really needs to step up the mobs because they are filling spaces with useless mobs. Of course the mobs have a few uses. But nothing in comparison with the other mobs that were offered
Whiney baby video for babies about a baby game where he shows baby animations for babies.
Glow squid was a disappointment
Honestly I just don’t like the choices this year. None of them seem that useful. Like they’re not really solving any previous issues. I also feel like they already had the sniffer in mind and wanted us to feel like we are choosing it. It’s the only mod that seems reasonably useful. The rascal is cool but not practical. And the tuff golem is cute but seems unpredictable. I don’t really care which one wins because I don’t see much use of any of them… but that just may be me?
One issue with this system is that people don't think for themselves and just pick what their favorite youtuber says to. It results in worthless mobs like the glow squid being added when we could've gotten an actual use for copper in the form of the copper golem
I’d love a runner up mob vote but I really want the moobloom aswell as the copper golem😭
I just hope we never have another mob like the phantom added to the game ever again.
I just realized that the tuff golem is literally a armor stand
Tuff golem > glow squid, then people Say the tuff golem is useless 💀
god the sniffer is so dumb pls don't vote for it its just a reskinned turtle with a sheep animation set. the digging in the ground for seeds is just a sheep eating grass
why would you want to NOT know everything about what your voting on?
cry about it
Tbf the first mob vote was the best but it went downhill from there, would've loved a 'blaze boss' or whatever, but a seed generator now? Come on
the mob vote makes me want to cry. it's such a cool idea, but handled in such an abysmal way that there really isn't a point to it. mojang keep adding more and more surface level stuff, to the point where it all feels superficial and not like minecraft anymore  I'm staying on 1.8 and prior
Bolivians: 😭
a new golem is cool but a sniffer is the best for some poeple i think that the sniffer is useles
What an outstanding prank the community played on itself voting phantoms into the game (me included), lmao. Would've been really cool to have giant squids instead.
there was a mob vote?
Also YouTubers need to stop trying to rig the votes by telling subscribers what to vote it should be what each person wants not what a single YouTuber wants
Tuff golem should’ve won
I still just really want the moobloom
As soon as a famous youtuber or steamer likes a mob Their fans will vote for that mob weather they like it or not
Sniffer
“Baby Sniffer” 😬
I think it was obvious the Sniffer would win because it was the only mob that was confirmed to give atleast 2 unique items.   The other mobs not only didn't have unique loot but also looked dull and felt like placeholders.  The fix in my opinion would be to give each mob 1 unique item at min. Eg plants for sniffers, new enchantment from rascal or new random item from golem every time it unfreezes. At this point the Rascal and Golem simply had low budget gimmicks while the Sniffer was too op
.....these mobs look like garbage.....
Let’s go Sniffer won! I love the Sniffer mob!
this is JUSTICE for the moobloom 🤬
It added in phantoms, enough said.
Honestly, I wish they'd stop adding more for a moment in general and instead work on fleshing out and tweaking what we already have. Adding features we missed from other new mobs and their abilities, fixing mechanics and adding new basic things that should have existed ages ago, etc etc. Minecraft is losing its charm to me and I would love it a lot more again if they just did this instead.
The funny thing is it would be easy for them to add it all in, but they'd rather watch the community fight with each other.  And before you say "it's probably too hard" a literal 12 year old made a 5 minute mod that added in all the non picked mobs.  It's just greed and meant to get you arguging(talking) about the game more
Once upon a time a game named Hytalepromise us something that at the day of todas we haven't reason why it pass to be named: Hypetale, thats EXACTLY what is happening with Minecraft, we can officialy call it *Hypecraft*
Whichever of you voted to add the phantom i just want you to know you made the wrong choice.
I like videos that are criticism’s and not complaints, providing potential solutions is a plus. Nice.
just remove the mob vote we the community can't be trusted, they should make their own game since that's what made it amazing in the first place, unique mobs, fun blocks and creative features.
Why not add them all?
I wasn’t able to watch Minecraft Live when it was happening, nor able to vote for the mob I was 99% sure the Sniffer would win and wasn’t suprised when I saw it did
I'm still salty about the glow squid, that mob vote was so rigged.
Elytra that can be fixed with leather
they can do all the mob votes they want, implement the most amazing mobs ever - but i will never forget how they failed the moobloom 😔
tbh the rascal and the tuff golem were pretty useless.
They said decorative plants
People will always choose what is the "cutest". The Alley was probably the most useless thing to have won and the Shiny Squid (I wasnt rly paying attention around that time, but I see a lot of people blaming dream for that choice lol)  I was hoping for Tuff Golem, but Sniffer isnt a bad choice either I guess.
i hate you for making me listen to the creepy minecraft cave sounds 😅:l 😂
I think they'll add all of them anyways ? Like it could just be a good way of seeing what the community really wants out of the game
I'd like to see tuff golem and sniffer
The problem i see even before even watching the video is that the mobs in the mob vote have sometimes a Amazing potential.. but Mojang doesn't describe any of it and therefor we can't expect it in the game.
I think people should just shut up about Mojang for once  If you wanted a blue pig that can explode a hoarde of witches that threw cakes and cookies at you, there's probably a mod for that  At the end of the way, mods (at least in Java) is the most effective way to prolong player experience in minecraft, keep it fresh and support indie creators  What would be a lot better is if Mojang just tweaked Java a bit, make it super cross platform so most other devices can play it (mobile, console, etc)   And done, stop complaining. Just play mods
Imagine them doing 3 different bosses. That’d be sick
Rip to the iceolloger
Mojang:takes year to add a stupid squid or frog  Modders:create the most in depth and insane godlike creatures in huge groupings in a few months
Why even the vote, don't they have enough money to organize enough resource that we can all three mobs ... I mean, the mobs we got so far didn't even add a lot to the game.
They work on those pixel art introduction videos more than the mobs. Any modder can add those to the game in an hour. Useless overhyping
The problem is not the voting, but the community.
I am kinda dissapointed by many changes in the new updates to be honest. Except reworked caves and mining and few other things, it feels so niche, weird and completely unnecesary, or sometimes borderline bad. Deep dark with Warden is something that made cave exploration worse for me (unkillable mob in a sandbox game💀), powder snow is annoying and anti-fun, multiple phantom groups spawning throughout a single night is idiotic, and probably every mob in this or the previous votes were kinda uselless and were mostly there just for being cute. I mean they could update desert biome with both fictional and realistic animals, or add some form of forest spirits (birch forests would really benefit from that).   I mean it's kinda clear that sniffer is going to win, but apart from his design being weird (only my personal issue), its function is still very niche and locking some plants behind him feels like a very forced and far-fetched choice. Personally, I am a fan of rascal, but again, that is mostly for it making cave exploration a bit more fun, and not for the reward.
Tuff golem         Sniffer 👇                       👇
I would stomp onto the egg. For some reason, i dislike sniffers a lot
I already made some suggestions. I think the vote was influenced by the obvious value of the Sniffer to minecraft modding and the need for more seeds or more flexibility in how we get them. I referenced super flat worlds. Assuming you can get the egg somehow the sniffer is most useful there. The Rascal is not. No mines. The Tuff Golem is decorative but may be useful in a mob grinder to pick up high value loot before it despawns. These really are a question about priority's: farming, mining or decorations. Farming won.
SNIFFIE WON!
I have much bigger doubts in the mob votes than this. No one finds it odd that the last two mob votes just so happen to come and they have at least beginning mechanics already in hand not to mention media presence already set and advertising ready for another Minecraft themed game? I'm not against them doing what they want to do. Fine and whatever. The game's still good regardless and more and more people are bitter that they're only adding in one of the mobs and just dumpstering the rest like they shouldn't be adding them in at all. If this is rigged, just say it and be done with it. Modders will add in pretty much anything to customize game play however the community wishes anyway.  On the other big note though. What I really don't like is this lack of information about the update at all. It's apparent that Microsoft has their grubby mitts in it again and they're unwilling to disclose information after the corporate chat moderation fiasco not to mention all the other undelivered features like bundles. The longer these antics go one the less trust I have in the game and this is starting to feel more and more like big brother is watching.
But this LITERALLY HAS HAPPENED. the glow squid never had ANY intended features beyond "textured squid that spawns in caves". The dream Stan community started spreading rumours to gain more glow squid voters, such as "there might be a glow ink for glowing signs" which slowly morphed into "THE WILL BE GLOW INK TO TURN WOOL INTO NEON COLOURED LIGHT SOURCES". A significant portion of voters were likely kids who believed the mass of flash info surrounding the vote, and since Mojang intended for glow squids to be a filler mob that loses, they had to concede and add the glow ink so the mob isn't literally just an aquatic bat.  They HAVE taken ideas from the community before, and they learnt their lesson about not adding depth to the creatures before the mob vote.
Didn't they say that the plants would be decorative only so all these mobs are extra useless
Two major problems. One the 2nd place mob is just deleted.   Like it could be 50 to 51 and they’ll get deleted. That’s such a waste. It’s really a vote of which one we don’t want.   And the major problem whatever we do get put in is always horrible because the community expect more from mojang. Either or both, mojang should take feedback from the community and use our ideas, and people should stop thinking mojang is gonna think the same way we do. They won’t we’re smarter than them.
The answer to the whole mob vote issue is two options:   1: Tell us EXACTLY what each mob will be instead of vaguely saying what they could be (phantom cough cough, as well as others)  2: Just add them all. The Minecraft Dungeon mobs get 10x more effort than the in-game mobs because Mojang is scared to do anything wrong. While I understand accommodating angry or upset players, and the idea of creating hype around a vote, this isn't the majority of the playerbase and most people don't really enjoy the mob vote as a concept.  Mojang talked a lot this year about accommodating their players, what they want, and how it affects the game long term. If they actually care about this concept, they'll listen to the players and implement the changes here. As someone playing this game since it had 30 or so items total and doesn't care about the issues they think players are thinking of, I just don't think they're doing enough compared to past updates and what the community truly wants. This is the second year or more of this problem, and we are (as is being mentioned on social media) tired of it. Please just listen to us rather than the preconceived notion of what Mojang *should* think.
I feel like the mob vote is just a way to keep the community feeling engaged while the developers slowly introduce a handful of things at a time, that end up being, sometimes, relatively mediocre.   I love Minecraft, and Dungeons isn’t a bad game, but I want more from Minecraft itself. And I fear another game like Hytale is going to come along and do a way better job out of making the Minecraft design contain more RPG elements
They could have just made it to where the mob who gets voted the most gets added first and then the other mobs just get added later, because so many good mobs will be lost if they keep doing this. The point of the mob vote is to strengthen the community and this method does the exact same thing but preserves unique ideas while doing so. I'm still really mad that the glow squid got picked over the other two. It has no real purpose and barely even glows when we could have gotten a cool boss enemy or a new way to get dyes.
GOOD UPDATE???
Good show wow jolly good show wow
the tuff glom is so fukin stuipid its just a walking item frame
I just really dont get why they dont just add all of them? They already have the design and concept of each mob down, how hard could it possibly be to implement them all now?
Huh, wouldn't it be even more fun if all three were added?
I haven’t played Minecraft since we lost the copper Golem.
to my homies who voted sniffer you guys are the reason why shampoo has instructions
Sniffer
My issue with mob votes is that I think they are secretly rigged. Also why only let one in when you can have all 3 or maybe let the mob vote decide the order they will be released.  I know that it sounds like allot of work, but part of the reason I stopped playing Minecraft was because they only added one, and it was a glowing squid. It didn’t do much of anything other than be a squid.
i rly hope the sniffer wins
Let’s just hope that nobody Riggs it
This Minecraft live made it clear to me, Minecraft doesn’t feel Minecrafty to me anymore. The mob vote was awful, sniffer was obviously gonna win, they didn’t even want a real fight.  Mobs start to be too complicated, most mobs since shulker have started to feel modded instead of real Minecraft mobs, and the blocks are getting ridiculous. Bamboo block looks way too soft, it hasn’t the rugged Minecraft vibe, and I haven’t even started with the names.   Chiseled book self????? Like for real don’t we have enough blocks?? You know you can just change a few of the old game mechanics and  make the new bookshelfs in place of the old. If it sounds too complicated, maybe then add a new block called shelf, and if you silk touch it with books inside you get a shelf with books.   And hanging signs? I mean, I understand the resource point, but I think it’s better just modify the old signs to work that way too,it might change some trap and red stone things, but we really did not need a second sign
I liked the Rascal best, but sniffer was going to win the moment it was announced, and I really don't know why it's struck the community, but it has for whatever reason.
I personally think a huge issue with the mob vote is its arguably able to be easily rigged. Not in the traditional sense. But the fact Minecraft encourages discussion of your vote prior to the reveal and Minecraft content creators often tweet their vote way before the end time. Really sways the mob vote. We saw this when dream tweeted about the glowsquid, as a famous example. Its a system that honestly doesn't work for such a large game with so many creators with fanbases. Because all it would take is a few big creators to influence small percentages of their audiences to completely sway a vote.  Maybe I just hate the mob vote and I'm old now and wish mojang just added all 3 mobs.
It would also help if people would stop voting for useless mobs in all the mob votes
I feel like they have the mobs/biomes made already but the whole voting thing is to add a sense of mystery and community involvement in regards to figuring out which one is coming while giving hints towards it
Tuff golem deserved to win for the sake of the Copper golem f you all who voted sniffer
The Sniffer is bad, i mean plants? the rascal plays hide and seek with you and give you stuff when you win !!
Sniffer deserved win
I really wanted the rascal to win, and as someone who doesn’t really explore caves, this would be something I would love to search for.
Mojang should add all previous rejected mob vote mobs. they're all unique and cool and its a shame to see the concepts wasted. all of them should be added in a future update.
i didnt even get a chance to vote, i tried on the website, tried in game, but the server was down ._.
we need all the mobs today
yes it does
Lame mobs
I will beat up the tuff golem
I just chose the sniffer because it was cute not knowing at all it’s purpose
In my opinion, I think the sniffer should be added. It doesn’t really have any downsides, we don’t know if we can control the tuff golem, and the rascal is only useful for so long. The sniffer could be paired up with the allay. If you trap them in a large space together, the sniffer would dig up seeds, and the allay would give them to you or put them in a hopper. The sniffer would also be really helpful at the beginning of the game so you have a stable food source.
Why can't they just add all 3 but only give the winning one an extra ability
I think Mojang need to sit down and think about the mob mechanics a lot more than they have been doing the last few years. I don't think any of the additions have been good enough. To add a mob, they need to solve a problem or serve a purpose. Be that a positive or negative one to the player, they need to have a reason or why bother at all.  They added horses, donkey's and Llamas because travel was slow and mundane. They added portable storage with Shulkers to carry more things for builds and excavating. Imagine Minecraft without Shulkers...  If the Alley or Stone Golem picked up dropped items and put them in nearby chests or shulkers. Guaranteed the community would go wild for it.   The idea would be if you're mining it would pick up any excess dropped items preventing lag or missed valuables, perhaps a good fail save if you're doing something wreckless and you place a chest nearby so it starts hucking your things in there after you die. It would cut down on sorting system contraptions,  you could use them as a way to pick up dropped items from farms and so on!  I can't think of a single use for a glorified shelf, a boring loot goblin who will give you a worse pickaxe than you have, or a turtle who rips out seeds. Do better.
I voted for the sniffer bcs in my mind all 3 sounds amazing but then i was thinking we need more new seeds/plants and sniffer would bring us that and i'd hope they will give us that.
Everybody gangsta till a youtuber rigs the vote
4 sure
Can we tame the sniffer though?
still am mourning my flower cow
all the winners of mob votes are blue glowing and has glowing eyes…starting to see a pattern here?
please turn the bass on your mic down by 150%
People seeing the mobs be like: Sniffer:YESS OFC Rascalt:maybe or maybe not tuff golem:🤮
Tuff golem be like scp 173
the problem is that it exists just add the 2 extra mobs it cant be that hard when you have a titan like microsoft to fund your every move
Yes. Every time the annoying mob wins and frustrates a majority of players. Mojang needs to stop future mob-votes while adding both the Tuff Golem and Sniffer to Minecraft.
nope. no arceology
I don't mind the sniffer winning the others one a tiny iron golem that holds stuff and a tiny guy that plays hide and seek for a iron pick
well sniffer won
shut up and sniff my feet
I’ll just stick with the old mc 1.16 thank you very much
just add all three lmao it dosen't take a year to make one shallow mob
I want a new biome vote fr
I feel like the Tuff Golem is going to have some incredibly cool mechanics for redstone and command block players to mess with.
Here’s an idea. If these mobs are all pre-designed and coded, just add all of them! I get that this would be expensive, but this is Minecraft we’re talking about
I actually got to vote this time
ok, i fully disagree that the phantom membrane is redundant.  the slow falling potion is one of the best life savers in both the end and the nether. be it falling off a cliff in the nether, giving you much more time to ender pearl to saefty. or in the ender dragon fight getting thrown into the air or knocked down from a piller.   it is a lot safer and secure than water bucket method or cobweb. as well as useable in the nether like i said, unlike water bucket
I really didn't care for either of the 3 they all seemed out of place and from a random mod some kid made 10 years ago
I keep imagining some future content with golems and golem temples, with similar colors to the Lihzahrd Temple from Terraria
they should add sea otters because there are not that many of them
now who else thinks we should choose to have ALL of them as a choice OR two out of the top 3??? good idea?
In my opinion, I think the problem is that mojang puts up a "cute" mob compared to two other "not as cute" mobs. It doesn't seem to matter what the cute mob does, or even how useful it is, but it always seems to win. I wonder why.
Apparently, this is the last Minecraft mob vote
THE SNIFFER HAS ONE >:D
why not just get all three mobs, & why the sniffer, seriously. The golem & Rascal seem to have more uses.
Mojang is big enough to add all three. The "vote" is just a gimmick to get people talking about Minecraft.
I think mojang didn't like that dream rigged the votes so now they're making them mediocre because if they made them interesting and the one mediocre mob wins and the interesting one loses  people will get angry
glow squid and phantoms have been the worst additions tbh. Glowsquids dont even emit light or do anything remotely interesting and phantoms are so annoying to deal with
The sniffer won!
me sad no golem...
I honestly just wanted the moo bloom… :( I don’t want to fire flies, I hate that they removed them
I missed the mob vote by an hour
Omg I used to love your new year firework creations, look how far you come!
Why is it so hard for them to add stuff in general? Can't they simply hire some of these super talented modders to make the game waaaay better waaaay quicker?
Everyone voted for the sniffer knowing full well their eggs are only underwater. I want to guess its mostly creative players but what use would they have for the mob in the first place
Is it just me or would sniffer be far more fun if rather then directly giving u seeds, it could also be a sort of minigame where it guides u to places where if u dig down u find the new rare and difficult to find seeds.
At least last year they went for a choice between all utility mobs, and this year, at least all friendly mobs, instead of dividing the categories between hostile and passive like in the prior year.  But I'm starting to think that putting build-a-mob golems shouldn't be part of the vote, and just added to the game at some future point.  The community is all about new golems, but we also really have a priority for adding mobs that refresh old structures and bland biomes and which add new lore to the game.  That, in my opinion is exactly why the Allay won, and why the Sniffer is the most likely win this year.  The Allay looked a lot like a friendly version of the Vex, gave us a better reason to explore outposts and mansions again, and added functionality.  The Sniffer looks like the fossils underground, gives us another reason to explore ocean ruins again, and promises a new plant.  The Copper and Tuff Golem are both cute and I think we all want them, but they just don't compare to something that refreshes outdated or lacking areas of the game.
Im still not over the moobloom...
I was so mad about Glow Squid, I was hoping they would do something cool with it, like allow us to make glowing banner designs, make our armor glow, actually have the mob glow instead of just being bright.
I feel like we’re overthinking it and sniffer kinda figs with the them of the archeology update that we think might happen next update. The reason they fit is because the used to roam the over world but went extinct therefore the archeology updated would perfectly fit with the sniffer
I don't care what anyone thinks, I like the Tuff Golem
The problem is that we only get one of them even tho they can easily add 3 mobs with no issue
Tbh, all the new mobs are kinda boring and people will just choose one like "this one is cute I guess" 🙃
I farm a l one t so I want the sniffer
The mobs need purpose. They need to add something new to the game. These mobs need to give an opportunity or ability to the player that they once did not have. Such as maybe if the sniffer could be used in some way to farm flowers and dyes. Or just more broadly the ability to do something new. That's what has been missing from minecraft updates. Oh cool, deep dark, oh cool, oceans, oh cool, this oh cool that, but ultimately the gameplay is still exactly the same as it was, just with a few new steps to achieve the same endgoal. Microsoft hasn't really done anything for the game gameplay wise. It's identical as when they bought it.
I think in the future tje sniffer will be able to sniff and find ores like ancient debris because its an ancient creature or be able to sniff things underground
bruh mojang’s put more effort into the frog walk cycle than all of the mob votes combined
Imagine we live in the timeline where there is no votr, just mojqng implemented all of em
Most times these votes are always disappointed, they are really reaching too low
My main problem is that most of the time the vote is so lopsided. The runner up mobs will likely just been thrown into a black hole never to be seen again. I wouldn’t mind seeing the vote tossed out and they just add all the mobs
Slow falling potions always get forgotten as coming from the phantom membrane. Quite useful potion for BEFORE the end!
vote for sniffer
Huh the hypnotizing was just them say it was pretty
Why create cool ideas to not eventually put them in the game....period I'd much rather add the top 2 or just do an mob update trailer or even add a COMMUNITY mob
Personally I think sniffer would be good for like flat survival
I voted for sniffer because scrunkly
The sniffer is cool tho and has a chance of new flowers I think
Honestly they should treat the mob vote like they do the biome vote where its not what mob will be added it will be what mob is added first
Minecraft lo mataron los devs y los wholesomes
yes, it has, they don't add all 3 of the mobs
We all know that the glow squid was only added because dream got his army of 10-year-old Twitter Stans to vote for it the iceoliger or moobloom would’ve been way cooler
Democracy failed again
So what is the problem with the mob vote? Did you ever answer the question posed in the title? It was all very unclear like a random stream of consciousness.
Sniffer/Rascal team 👇
I want either the sniffer or the rascal, the sniffer is SO cute though ❤
Man I wish I had seen the rascal earlier, it's cute
The sniffer winning this vote is sad, and honestly can't wait to see everyone extremely disappointed like each time
you forgot about SLOW FALLING POTIONS..!! the single other use for Phantom Membrane. yes, they're actually really useful. easiest yet most fun Ender Dragon fight i've ever had. plus, they're just loads of fun to play around with, great minigame potential too, for multiplayer servers  also, what're your sources for the last half of the video? i dont remember hearing or reading anything about changing the colors of tuff golems, or that you find Sniffer Eggs specifically in Underwater Ruin chests - just "underwater" (yes i just went back and checked, found nothing..)
I think we should have 2 mob votes a year. One vote being between losing mobs and the other being new mobs. That way people don't pick the new mob cuz it's new or old just out of pity for it not making it originally and fear of never coming back if they were just one vote.   They could have a different team work on the old mob that wins. It'd just be nice to know that they weren't lying about bringing the older mobs back to implement.
Why didn't they call the sniffer the snuffalow
My issue with the mob vote is I want them all and this community interaction they're pushing is gatekeeping the content.
There were also the Biome choosers which were mob votes (in a way) 2018 the winner was the Taiga, adding the foxes (Rip Meerkats and Ostriches) and in 2019, the winner was mountains, adding the goats (Rip Vultures and Frogs? well frogs are added now, sooo hopefully we get the meerkats, ostriches and vultures soon)
Why not gives us all
Sniffer is just a funny name idk what to tell you
This guy speaking facts tho
4:30 thanks for mentioning the mesmerizing ability, it was why I personally voted and it just got ditched.
Rascal king
I really hope the sniffer wins. Also the rascal is just gollem from lord of the rings and the tuff golem is just a walking item frame
ppl with there dirty minds if the sniffer gets added to minecraft
Phantom membrane is also used for slow falling potions*
Why did ppl vote for the phantom…
That animation is way too smooth wth
It’s only winning because it has a funny name lol, People will be bored of the new plant after one round of seeing them. Atleast the rascal is USEFUL at some point in the game snd the tuff golem is a Cute pet
Just stop messing Minecraft up
The phantom membrane is also a potion ingredient.
The fact that the phantom even exists should make the title of this video a no brainer
I miss my man the copper golem everytime I play mc
Mojang just release stuff and then abandon
Thank you for pointing out that these mobs votes are practically feature complete, as I feel that's a minecraft issue in general. Whenever we see a new update at live; that's it, besides a few bells and whistles, rarely do they seem to add much more than they show off, and so some features feel stale before they've even realised. There are a few exceptions, but they're just that: exceptions
Besides the sniffer I feel like the mobs this year were kinda weak compared to previous years. Nothing really exciting :/
Y  are they even doing votes they should just add what they want it's their game
Like if vote sniffer
Must annoying thing about minecraft mob vote: it's a vote, why not add all the mobs? They would expand the gameplay immensely.
The problem is that there isn't really a vote, -microsoft- mojang already decided the mob to implement, the "vote" is simply there to make kids think they are contributing to the community. isn't it sad how everything from movies to games to everything in-between slowly descends to being kiddy friendly? Its BS.
Copper golem
I’d like to see them have 2 new mobs each year and 2 previous losers for the 4 mobs to choose. Then it gives others a chance that could be just as good
One thing I find to be a shame is the lack of cool new dimesions. It would be really interesting if they let us vote on things like the Eden dimension from the DivineRPG mod to get something like that in the game
Personally, I just hate how, especially with this one and the last, the winning mob has had SIGNIFICANTLY more planned abilities than the others, making it quite obvious who would be voted for.
Why can't we get all 3 of them
I don't like how popular Minecraft YouTube's take such a toll on the mob votes like the glow squid there were much better mobs until they said for people to vote for the squid
Ues it has sniffer isnt the only mob that got voted
ngl, I'm kinda sad Tuff didn't get voted in. Would have loved the potential implementation of randomness with redstone mechanics.
To be honest the rascal creeps me out
The problem is that everyone Is only voting mostly for what dream says or if they think it is cute
The rascal would have had a better chance if he was an item duper, like if ya find him three times he copies a random item from your inventory and gives it back with the "counterfeit" prefix. This would also solve the problem of literally all finite, non renewable items by adding a way to make more, although tedious and inefficient.
I think that maybe it would be cool if when you find Rascal three times, he could lead you to some rare place like a treasure instead of just giving you a pickaxe.
Mojang should add all of them, why only pick one. End of discussion
Crackpot theory: archeology-> the forgotten update, implementing outvoted content from like 3 votes
I love the sniffer
I think the mob vote where the allay won was the least controversial because it appeared that all the mobs in the vote were fully explained. All the other mob votes either overstated or understated the mob's features to a degree that led to confusion. I still would have voted for the glow squid because I don't care for another cow variant and the iceologer looked annoying.
i really dont like the mobs for this year cuz they really just dont look appealing to me
They seriously need to do a hostile mob vote, it's been 3 years of passive and it's getting kinda boring
Copper Golem Gang :(
i dont get why they still do the votes honestly, they know how much hate they got and they would get SO much more revenue in just adding all 3 compared to some dumb vote that's popularity would only last for like the first 2 votes ONLY
What the hell do you mean, yes it does because it doesn’t even make sense
Prediction: Next would be Dessert and Savannah Update?
Bruh  dripleaf seeds are probably "one of the two new plants" thats gonna be added
I like the sniffer because new seeds means new plants. New plants may mean new types of blocks. New plants also may mean new food items.
I hope they don't change the bundles too much since I have a mod that lets me craft them and a mod that lets them hold unstackable items and those would probably break if they change it too much, the unstackable one is super useful I can have 64 potions, enchanted books, or pickaxes/any tool in one bundle
Personally I feel like their going to rig the votes.
I WANT THE SNIFFERR❤️😭
WHY DO PEOPLE NEVER WANT THE GOLEM I WANT A TINY GOLEM
Phantom should of never won Monster of the Depths, Flying Inferno, and The Great Hunger should of won. They had greater designs and had cool ways to attack players. Monster of the depths would literally drag a player deep underwater drowning them, Flying Inferno had a Shockwave move, and The Great Hunger could of been used for soo many things but nah we got the phantom
I hope Minecraft just adds all lost voted mobs because many of them would add more fun and mystery to the game.
Biggest issue with mob votes WHY THE F DID SNIFFER WIN? Edit: why tf they dont just add every mob update later? Why do they scrap ideas? Game would be much more fun.
I have absolutely hated these since the first one with the phantom... they have all turned out underwhelming or in the case of the phantom just an annoyance nobody likes.
I kinda wonder why does it takes so much to implement these mobs Taking into account how modders can work things out in a day, months to add this kind of feature seems weird
There should be second mob votes, like take the most popular losers from old mob votes and pick from them. Like moobloom and the sea creature etc. So that way we aren't left feeling disappointed when the votes are unfairly swayed
I wish they’d ad a “non of the above” vote option
It literally is a lack of good mob choices..
I know there are problems with the mob vote, but I will forever stand by the sniffer because it makes me very happy
Misfortune upon all Alay and Glowsquid voters, with the Moobloom and Glare along with the Sniffer I could have had my very own plant buddy possee
The problem is that they said they'd "MAYBE" add new plants with the sniffer. No one cares much for the mob, but wants the new plants as that will spice the game up. But will they add them? Probably no!
NO NO THE RASCAL BETTER WIN THEYRE THE MOST USEFUL ONE
ik everyone is gonna regret choosing the sniffer cuz its a turtle
I think the Devs use the mob vote to gauge players opinions on various gameplay elements. For example, this year they can learn that the 0layerbase is more interested in new decoration blocks than new ways to obtain items or display items.
Imagine thinking Mojang cares about community feedback. They got so much backlash from the banning system, yet they did nothing to listen to improve.
jsut add all the mobs
Woohoo! One millionth view here!
The problem is that they told us what the mobs we're voting for do?
Man, the mod of the egg is so bad mob, the only mob usefull is the mines mob :v (i forgot the names)
maybe they should have actual hostile mobs or more combat oriented mobs, its more exciting overall then all this passive stuff, its been the same for years ever since the first mob vote since every one in the first mob vote was a super dangerous powerful entity. Passive mobs are cool but they shouldn't take every slot in a mob vote. There isn't really a thrill to passive mobs like offensive mobs, if you know what I mean. I just feel they could've capitalized on having more hostile/offensive mobs in the votes.
The only thing i dont like about the new updates is that the new mobs are losing the "minecraft" look. They all looks like something you would see in a mod, collorfull and with complex desings, its like when they remade the default textures, now it looks like those high detailed texture packs...   idk if i'm just being a bommer but minecraft was supossed to be simple  ._.
If sniffer doesn't win, I AM CRYING MYSELF TO SLEEP
Its funny cause i preffered tuff golem or rascal.
I hate all the mobs added since elytra.  No new good building blocks.  Nothing.  All trash updates.
only reason im voting for sniffer, is because it looks like a freaking piñata
Sniffer looks like it be sniffing the ground for coke
The big issue with the mob votes are the mobs themselves. After all the hype dies down it's just another creature to come across and go "oh cool I haven't seen one of those in a while" It happened with the Allay, Phantom, and Glow squid.  Most people just chuck the Allay into a farm and never look at them again. 90% of players never see Phantoms because they sleep, not that it matters because a bow or a stone sword takes them out easily. They're obsolete by the time they start spawning. And finally the Glow squid... You know how we're always out looking for squids? me neither, if I want a glowing item frame I'll just put some glow stone behind it.  It will probably be the same for all the currently competing mobs. The Sniffer loses it's main purpose when you just punch some grass, or find other seeds in chests. The Rascal gives you a pickaxe that breaks after a couple hundred blocks. And the Stone Golem is just a walking item frame.  I just don't see the point in pouring so much time and effort into setting up the mob vote, and creating the animations and concept art for the mobs in the first place when they could just... Add the three mobs? Most people will forget which ever mob ends up winning anyways.
I feel like Mojang should start doing something more like an "Update Vote" where instead of a single mob or biome, it could be an entire update. I think this would build a lot more hype, and also all the mobs/items would fit together. It would also make the votes feel more meaningful.
Yeah, I know it has one problem. *_NOBODY ASKED FOR THESE MOBS._*
Oh boy I hope dream doesn’t rig it again to select a useless mob
first vote ever i did was kinda useless
Whatever I vote is wrong.  So I don't vote.    When they suggest something in line with skeletons and zombies-- like werewolves  or vampires-- I'll consider voting.
Sniffer lowkey be a Pokémon and we love Pokémon, choose Sniffer.
I hate the sniffer
Im fkin sick of mojang presenting me with golems that I want, but know aren't gonna win... Just fkin add the golems already.
I hate the whole mob vote idea. I wish they'd just add them all in.
just add create already dum dum microsoft
What I don't understand is why Mojang can't just add all the Mobs into the game?
I just want the sniffer because that thing is cute
Seeds r my favorite thing in Minecraft pls give me more to fill my inventory
Honestly i want the next mob vote to have an option to remove phantoms from the game. That was the single biggest mistake in minecraft history, NOBODY likes phantoms. Either they flat out lied about the phantom in the vote, or they rigged it, because no one in their right mind wouldve voted for such an annoying abomination
I always thought that the sniffers nose holes were it's eyes
I still don't get why not just add all of them
I think they also need to understand the community more. the rascal if you ever somehow got it to your bae would probably be a nightmare to keep around, the golem would be cool but a lack of control is off putting, and the sniffer is basically just a cow, easy to keep around in your base, easy to showcase, and would look cool to free roam around your base. many players fall into the builder type of playstyle where they just grind to build and the sniffer far outweighs the other mobs in aesthetic for new build ideas
Why they can't just add all of them? I don't understand what the point of throwing good mobs into trashcan just because they didn't won rigged elections
the problem is that there’s a vote in the first place, they should add all the mobs they had planned, sounds childish but come on who really doesn’t want it?
What stormfrenzy is probably trying to get to is that none of these mobs actually add anything to the game. They're just more stuff, the kinds of additions that you would find in mods. Over time these mobs clutter the game and make it a less enjoyable experience.
This video made me notice the only mob vote with actual, useful and interesting mobs was the first Discarding the iceologer ofc
Honestly thought the sniffer was like a large galapagos turtle, now I see it has nostrils, which I thought were his eyes... And EARS?? What??
I think the minecraft phantom repair system is very useful & u should not need to get mending as the only option, I don't see how it is redundant at all considering how mending needs XP & u need to keep the in mind how many thing u have with mending. Swapping out so the elytra is the only thing using the XP, as well as taking the item that u likely only have one of into a mine where u are more likely to die well getting the XP to fix it.
the only problem here is that the sniffer is like ten times better
RIP Moobloom
minecraft devs should stop listening to their community, we are all idiots

1:51 scp moment here
You said “seeds” and “plants” meant at least two, but I disagree: they could just as easily (if not more likely) reference more than one of the same seed or plant, not more than one type
The biggest issue is the mob votes is their laziness. Stop these mob votes. Add all 3 mobs you propose. It's getting old. People need to start calling out Mojang for their laziness.
Obviously what ever Dream votes for is gonna win like always
It’s legit the same thing as last year. Sniffer is the most popular choice just like the Allay so that’s gonna win. The Tuff Golem is in a close second place yet it will lose just like the Copper Golem. And the Rascal is just out of the question for wining just like the Glare.
I would want the rascal or sniffer
I still don't understand why Mojang can't just add them all. IT'S ONLY 3 MOBS.
i like the rascal tho :c
Alright guys. Reply to me. Let's create mobs that would be useful and people would actually want. Give it a name too 🙃 Think of as many creative ideas for your mob! I'm excited to see what people come to with..!
“What are you-“ “Sniffer” “I didn’t even-“ “SNIFFER ALL THE WAY” Sniffer: *Intense Sniffing*
Next mob vote should be made of old ones that where relatively popular
I dont want ~any of them~, I want the ~copper golem~
all 3 are pretty crappy one is essentially decor (tuff statues) one is new special plants that might end up being a total let down if the special plants only have one use  (sniffer) and one is one that adds a new peaceful cave mob that does more than just exist at least but gives you items that may be useless later down the line. (Rascal)  over all im going for rascal because at least it adds a peaceful mob to the caves that does more than just exists it plays a game with you
I'm kind of torn on this vote.  I like the Sniffer because, hey, new plants and pets are always good!  I've always wanted a tame Ravager or Hoglin, and this seems like it would be in this category.  I like the Tuff Golem, because it would help bring my house to life.  Instead of just having nosy villagers snooping around in there.  But I have a bit of a soft spot for the Rascal.  Might just be me, but I get excited when I find some ancient, derelict mine.  Having a mob specific to that area would be very cool!
the sniffer is the only thing i dont wont
Imagine if we could ride the sniffer like a horse
3 billion dollar game and Mojang just says here are three mobs, you only get one and we wont explain what they do completely
I hate mob votes. Just add them all.
just for the new plants alone, the sniffer wins. The other 2 don't really add much to the game.
Honestly I didn’t really like any of the mobs this year but I voted Rascal. First, the tuff golem doesn’t seem super interesting unless it’s for like a museum or something which near to no one actually makes. I mean they’re cute and all and it’s cool that you can change the colour but just kinda boring. Plus they’d just end up carrying like seeds or dirt or sum unless you give it an item so yk. In all honestly yeah new plants sounds cool, but seeds? I hate farming and I don’t wanna have to grow decorative items, that’s just annoying. Plus it’s just kinda ugly imo, especially if it’s that big. It would kinda just get in the way. Idk how it works but people are treating it as if it’s gonna just constantly give them seeds when in reality it probably has a cool down or needs to be fed or something. Also the idea of finding them in ocean monuments give me mixed feelings. It’s another reason to go down there but also I don’t like going down there anyway so yk lmao. I will admit rascal probably does give sh** items but I mean a free iron pick is just nice to have early game anyways, and it doesn’t seem _that_ hard to find. Plus, even if it gives you terrible loot I’d still wanna play hide and seek with it. It’s makes caving a little more fun and introduces a new hide and seek mechanism into the game, so that’s pretty cool. Idk I don’t really like any of them this time but I don’t really care which one is added 🤷 just my opinion on the options
I can't think of the glow squid without thinking of Dream *sigh*
I'd never vote for something like the Sniffer, but then again it's the only one that actually adds new items to the environment, I think that is it's main selling point.
I feel like minecraft should just add all of the mobs that way there is more stuff included in the updates how cool would it be to get 3-4 new mobs each update rather than just the one that only maybe 40% of the community actually wanted it’s not a majority but it is enough votes. if the developers already have the complete concept ready to go for each mob why not add them in instead of wasting money paying your employees to develop/come up with the other mobs if they aren’t going to be implemented into the game
I really like the golem. Having little stone men walking around, like little assistants would be neat. Maybe set up an old dusty library, with tiny stone helpers wandering around.
Let's face it. The sniffer is the only interesting one. I don't want an iron pick with efficiency 1 and curse of vanishing from the rascal and I don't need a decorative golem.
I want the sniffer or the tough golem
I just think that people aren't thinking about future improvements or additions based off of the mobs they vote for. Like glow squids don't add much, but a flower cow could've added potential for bee farms or whatnot. I think the sniffer could add a lot more content to minecraft and it can go hand-in-hand with the ancient cities. Ancient minecraft would be really cool to explore, but I'm sure people are gonna vote for tuff golem.
Y'all are gonna start demanding an electoral college for mob votes at this rate. It's a kids game. Most popular vote wins. That's it.
What's funny is the Sniffer was the most developed and explained while the others were vague.   It's almost like the Sniffer was going to win anyways
I want the rascal but the sniffer is winning
please vote for the rascal
Really hope they give us a farming update with the new sniffer since it looks like its ganna win.
This is somewhat unrelated but I was climbing some jagged peaks yesterday and all I could think was why hasn’t Minecraft made a Yeti mob yet?
i want a dino puppy
Sniffers soooo goood
Im so sad for the golem, he's just so cool
I hope for the Rascal because it could possibly drop OTHER enchanted items and I love the fact it's like a Goblin, lurking in the caves with you.
this such a well put together video !!! thank you so much !
I knew it, I knew the Sniffer will win .
Seems like it's a done deal already doesn't it? Yep. Voted for sniffer. Bit of a pointless exercise as they have made it the most attractive option...  What I'd really like is if they just concentrated on finishing the previous updates and a bit of finesse like quality of life, bugs, actually implementing what they say they will and of course admitting more parity means no bundles.... fine- so do the inventory update and take a break. In the meantime I'll just see what works N0w and go with that.
Even with only what was explicitly said, the sniffer still feels like a complete feature. A large mob that allows you to grow new plants. If you want the plants, you need the sniffer. Meanwhile I can totally see myself completely ignoring the rascal and never building a tuff golem
Why the mob I vote for gets never picked
I’m voting the sniffer
way to drag a video out 6 minutes longer than it needed to be
Why cant they just use all instead of making a vote ):
Best selling game of all time but they cant afford to add more than one block monster more often than once every two years
I think another thing that could be interesting with the sniffer is allowing players to use a saddle on them. I think having another mob to ride around on that isn't a horse or pig would be really cool, and when ravagers were added I thought we'd be able to ride them somehow since they have saddles. Idk I think ppl would like having a bigger mob to ride around on
The fact that we don’t hear anything about any of the mobs that lost getting even considered to be added is just… sad and a bit annoying
the problem with the vote is that there is a vote in the 1st place we should have all of them min craft doesn't really have much to do and blazes are hard to find in the 1st vote we literally had the ability to make blazes spawn outside of fortresses
Imagine tuff golems but they act like weeping angels
It's my opinion that they shouldn't have a vote, but just add all three... If they put less effort into making these votes they could put more effort into adding actual features to the game.
I mean yeah the Sniffers cute but all it does is give us seeds.. , the Rascal I honestly have no idea what that does and the last one seems like it just steals stuff.?   (Just based off the animation in the beginning)  Edit - I guess it’s cool but the thing is you can very easily lose items with the tuff item and the Sniffers still just cool and the new plants are hopefully cool but I’m not sure how I feel abt that since it’s literally JUST there to give seeds but like I said it’s still cute and with the Rascal not knowing what it gives just makes it a gamble is it worth chasing? or should I just give up and leave it alone? function is the most important thing for the most part but also for some people they like cute, small and ‘cheerful’ (probably the wrong word) thing while other like spooky, creepy, and hunted things and some people are in the middle or maybe don’t care for either (somehow) but I’d like it if they could add flower cows why? cause their cute that’s it but also for them to add more creatures that are more ‘creepy’ maybe a skeleton and zombie dog like if the dog gets killed my a zombie it becomes one and you can give it rotten flesh to stay a zombie but if you don’t feed it it slowly becomes a skeleton because it hasn’t been given flesh and it would normally slowly fall off
I want a 2d Minecraft that looks identical to these mob vote introductions to mobs
that plants are DECORATIVE DECORATIVE so that plats are going to be useless
I want the mob vote to change... Instead I want all 3 mobs.. With basic ideas.. Then open submissions in additional ideas for the mobs from the community.. I think it would satisfy all people.. People who would like all the ideas added not just 1/3 of them and the community is directly involved in the direction a mob takes from Mojangs initial ideas.
mojang also confrimed that the plants are decorative
sacrifice them all for copper golem
it won't let me even vote
Just look up at night and tell me there isnt a problem
Vote for the Sniffer!
Tough golems we’re literally walking item frames
The best selling videogame ever has the worst devs TBQF
Sniffer will win. I haven't seen a single poll that says otherwise.
Justice for the moobloom. Glow squid added nothing of use building, mining, or lore wise
I don’t like any of the choices this year.
Rascal
I voted sniffer.
The problem is that the freaking vote on the website didn't work
I can point out a few issues with these mob votes and I'll start with that since there are usually 3 Choices we can have weird results that Impair what the community actually wants I will use an example Mob 1 - 43% Mob 2 - 29% Mob 3 - 28% Mob 1 wins the vote but lets say that Mob 3 Voters second choice was Mob 2. If we redo the vote with this in Mind and Remove Mob 3 let's see what happens. Mob 1 - 43% Mob 2 - 57% Wait so now Mob 2 beats Mob 1 and bare in mind this is not likely that Every single voter from Mob 3 would have wanted Mob 2 only but this is just an example. This is the problem with having Three options because the real winner might actually lose due to the Community being split over two similar mobs.
this is why modding is good..... mojang is just about publicity
voting has never been a good idea
bruh why sniffer it has no purpose other than getting you a few seeds that's pointless. At least having some fun with a sneaky mob would make mining even more intriguing. I vote RAscalll
My problem is that all of the mob options really aren’t that interesting. It’s something that even if all three of the mobs were added, it still wouldn’t change the game substantially. The original mob vote had the most interesting potential.
1:20 if only I can make my ideas into reality  Creepy Rascal animation in the caves Boohbahs eyes
Is there gonna be a new update
why would you go for anything besides the rascal its literally giving us an enchanted tool
MOB VOTE NOW
I think that the biggest problem with this mob vote is that one from two other mobs has always something more, like litellary.  Tuff gollerm just holds things and can be told to stay in one place, not that useful but it's cool {nothing new added}. Rascal if you find him 3 times he will give you something, cool cool a really nice help i suppose {also nothing gets added}. And then we get the Sniffer, dude seeks for seeds and plants and also the promises about finding it secrets {adds 2 plants and seeds}. But with the sniffer i saw that lot's of pepole are hoping to get anything from archeologic update witch seems to be really wanted by the pepole {from what ive noticed since the previous mob vote}. I think presonally that the mojang should either always add 3 mobs at once without voting, that would be more exciting to play the game than plating it with one new mob that is barely noticable {im talking about Allay cause ive never found him after the update where he was added either on survival or creative or maybe i wasn't looking right, still don't like this mob tho}
ok we have 1.20 but when will 2.00 (2.0) come out? AFTER 1.100??????
Man all the first half of the video does is remind me that the worst one always wins the vote regardless
Go team sniffer!
The sniffer is like a Dino and a turtle
Why can’t they just add all of them?
I hope one day that the mobs that didn't get voted in are just all added at once maybe 1.20 could?
When will we have a ender monster??? There's a dimension that  literally got 3 mobs and one type of plant only. The end deserve better
i dont get why they dont just add all of them
They should add some of the older mob vote mobs that didn't make into later mob votes
So the problem is that they give people all the features upfront so they can make an informed voting choice, but what they really should do is have some crazy awesome feature that’s not mentioned until after people have already made their decision? I think if they want to take a community feedback into account they should do so before the vote, otherwise people don’t really know what they’re voting on.
Everyone, please don't regret this mob
i hate that after the vote all losers get discarded even tho some have arguably better game play. the lack of expanding on them is also not helped. like i would add the mob voted one in for sure but some of the other could be all implemented latter down the line. or even reworked into even more awesome things. i just feel like its creating a rule that does not need to exist on them maybe say instead the other that lose just have a chance of latter on being added. like in this scenario im sad i like the idea of the hide and seek creature that gifts you things maybe they should of made it so it gifts things based on character level it has unique enchantments maybe drops unique items or chests.  im happy they do they vote but i think runner up should have a high chance of also being added.
why the hell would we vote a glowing squid over a new hostile mob that yeets ice at you...oh right..dream stans. Also I will say it right now, I kinda like the Rascal.
i would have wanted these mobs to win:  mob d (the big blaze)  the iceologer  the allay won and that makes me happy  and the sniffer since he looks funny an is better than the others
Honestly think mob votes should've been structured as: -3 mobs getting voted for  -Winner gets added in the next update immediately  -Losers go to the waiting room. when the next mob vote rolls around they are added along with the next year's winning mob as special additions.  Adding last year's losers in the following year would even bring more excitement to the mob vote, we'd be getting the winning mob + last year's losers- I personally think that would've been the best way to do it tbh, so winning feels meaningful since they get added a year earlier but losing doesn't mean getting scrapped forever, but instead being handed to the mob vote next year for some extra hype
One big problem is that mojang focuses on kids, and the early and middle of the game, where kids normally find themselves. So the mobs become just a interesting new toy that for players that speed though the early progression mean nothing. The new mobs from the votes never become a fundamental aspect of gameplay. No one needs phantoms for elytra. No one needs a horn from a goat. Most likely, no one will need the sniffer after getting the new seeds.
Remember the moobloom
There's also something weird about the community picking mobs. They do pick what there's more information on, but in the end it just ends up being pointless. The sniffer doesn't seem like it'll be what we're expecting in the end to me, knowing Mojang. If they do go with that one, they're gonna have to make something entirely new and implement it to the game, like making a new ancient fruit (ig idk how to call it) that needs to have special features, include it to the trading system, and give it more than one use. I don't think that's what we'll get in the end.  That's why to me the Rascal is more fun at least, why wouldn't you want to play hide and seek in the caves to then get a reward?? Added to new generation of non neutral mobs and the warden, it sounds like a fun adventure.  Idk I don't like the way the community instantly picks the winner mob without a second thought, especially when Mojang clearly gives more details for one mob than the other
YES, ABSOLUTELY. It is the dumbest thing that they've done. Mojang needs to add more mobs instead of more biomes. We don't need big empty biomes, we need medium sized biomes that are full of life, details and items that are unique to that biome. Like the deep cave or whatever the name is. It's cool, really fcking cool, but there are only a few things that you can do there and it only has one mob. One mob. You think that big team like Mojang would add more than just that because they have all the resources that they need, but nope. It is also really sad to see all of those mobs that they permanently removed just because it lost the votes, when the vote itself isn't balanced. I'm just so mad that they keep doing this. All I want is more cool mobs, whether it's useless or not.
While the sniffer would be cute I would rather the rascal as it would make caves just a little more interesting
I still wish Blaze Boss was added instead of that flying annoyance
I personally think they need to just implement some more existing mods into the vanilla game. Like waystones, ice and fire, spartan weaponry, craft able saddles, a basic furniture mod. Something that isn't like 3 things a year
Vote for the sniffer fr
I wish the tuff golem had more mechanics 😥 we really need uses for stuff we already have in the game that are practically useless. for example with copper golem, them being able to push copper buttons would've been great for sum kinda auto farms. they should've added more mechanics to the tuff golem to make it more useful/unique. still im going to vote for tuff golem bc I feel lik i would rather have a use for what he have in game already than adding sumthing new. and also the sniffer seems useless to me and honestly I don't care that much about new decorative plants unless theyre adding new foods which theyve already said theyre not 😕
The tuff golem reminds me of like that dark souls 3 npc
ngl i voted the squid thinking we'd get a submarine with it.. was wrong sadly
Everyone just wants the sniffler to get into the game because of its design. In fact, I bet no one cares about its seed finding ability
I AM DEFFINETLY VOTING TUFF GOLEM
I mean, yeah, the sniffer looks cute. So uhhhhhhh, yeah, gimme dim seeds.
sniffer is about to be a complete waste of everyones time. its literally the worst option. but noo everyone wants something "cute". rascal would jave been the best option for the simple fact that they drop diamond pickaxes
still waiting on the kraken
How to vote??
I think it would be cool if they add every single mob that lost lol
Sniffer is adorable that's the reason. Tuff golem is weird decoration the unlike other 2 golem doesn't attack. The weird hermit in a mineshaft is pointless the moment you get a enchanting table in a place that can be hard to find and most of the time you go to a mineshaft for the spawner, rails, or apples not to play hide in seek with a thing that should live in a swamp with its hill Billy vibe
Remember we wanted the fantoms.
What if the mob vote is pointless and it was just created to make us think that there are actually choices but in reality mojang already know which mob will win because of its usability
I'm honestly just inlove with the sniffer, Ik some people find it boring that it only gives out seeds, but i absolutely love seeds for long-term survivals. plus new plants would be nice.
Raskel isn't as good tbh end game minecraft he really pointless and I rather have a big boy turtle
if we get the useless tuff golem ill cry
Why not the 3 smh
Personally I enjoy large amounts of content. I'm not satisfied getting just one of the few concepts they've already thought up and could add if they wanted.  It's why I choose to stay a few versions behind to use mods that add a lot of additional content and features.
They've already got the ideas for the mobs. For a huge team like this, I can't fathom why they don't just.... Y'know .. add them all.   I mean I know why- for the cash grabs- but still. Minecraft was ruined when Microsoft obtained it.
VOTE RASCAL
😮
The problem with the mob vote is that it’s a vote. We can only have one thing, and it doesn’t make sense. I guess Mojang doesn’t want it’s community happy or something?
I think my main issue with the mob votes is twofold:  1) Every mob that's added via a mob vote has felt really disjointed - like it doesn't relate to the update on a deep level, and was just added as an afterthought.  2) We're told very little about the mobs during the mob vote, and this information is often unclear and imprecise - I voted for the glow squid solely to see that hypnosis effect, and we got nothing. Add to that what you mentioned in the video - that the mobs are feature-complete on announcement - and it just makes everything feel very lacklustre, ESPECIALLY if you don't get a feature that was seemingly promised.
i dont care which one wins honestly i just want a sniffer plushie
Mum can we get Phoenix SC No we have Phoenix SC at home Phoenix SC at home:
something I've also noticed is that Mojang seems to very clearly have a favorite in the newest mob vote. And of course they do, not only is the sniffer the most marketable of the three, it also actually has features that sound interesting and cool. Oh wow, I chase a gnome around for 20 minutes and get an item that I'll probably wind up throwing in a lava pool to save inventory space. And then wow, cool, a walking item frame. And those two aren't really visually appealing as much as the Sniffer is.
My question is when that submarine is being added!
Phantoms have potion craft  Slow falling potions are using phantom membranes in the recipe they are useful and frankly never that bad only ones complaining are small groups. EDIT: no vote this time i think there all bad but one clearly adds more though is waste of time to ever go for. also, i feel people forget the fact about the potion craft when comes to phantoms.
I worry they would remove some features from the winning mob like what they did to other winning mobs
I think that we should be able to treat the sniffer like a camel and slowly ride it but also, to add more depth, allow a layer of blocks to be placed on its blocky body. This could bring uses like covering it in chests or a walking kitted workstation. It’s sitting state can be used once you command it to like a dog.
So, seed seeker, stuff taker, and weeping angels from dr who in the form of tiny golems like gnomes. Wonderful.
All it takes is a high standing community member to mention a mob and everyone votes for it. This community can’t think for themselves.
I’m voting for Tuff Golem, but it feels like the Sniffer comes with the most stuff. It makes the vote seem unfair. Why not have each mob come with a new unique item
I'll say it again like I do every year, they could just add all 3, no chance of dividing the community is all are added
I honestly feel like the Rascal would be an easily cheesable thing. Spawns below Y-0, but imagine you're strip mining and just so happen to find one. A long, narrow path. No hiding spots available. Unless it gets the option to burrow like the Warden, it would just be too simple.
I know everyone will be voting for sniffer but I really like the rascal because it makes the game a bit more scary while also giving us a chance to get possibly good tools just by playing a little game of hide and seek- sounds a lot more fun then just getting some new seeds!
All 3 of these Mobs are terrible. I don't like any. I wish there was an option to vote for an older mob.
Here's my thing? Why have us vote. Why not put all 3 in the game anyway. No fomo. Maybe make the votes instead who comes in first and make the others be released at a later date? This year in particular, its been really chafing me, because I like the idea of the Tuff Golem, but I really want new plants. So it's like..... what are we doing here? Minecraft Mobs aren't even that complex. Let em all come hang out, who cares..  I'm ranting... haha.. but, surely I can't be the only one feeling like this.
Why don’t they tell us ALL of what the mobs do before we vote. It’s almost as if the votes don’t matter because we end up getting mobs that don’t meet expectation.
Why the heck would the sniffer win, the rascal would add more depth to mineshadts since they havent been changed at all since they were added unless im stupid
I think the most obvious issue with the mob vote makes more losers than winners. Aren’t video games supposed to be fun? Losing isn’t fun :,)
This Is exactly what ive been saying
God the sniffer is adorable
Mojang have lost their way...
No the biggest issue is not adding all three.
I voted sniffer
WHAT DO THEY ALL DO
We need a capybara mob.
I still really wish the glow squid had actually emitted light and glowed like the name implied. While a glowing texture is nice and all, it would have much more use and bring a vibrant mystery to Minecraft with a mysterious glow coming from the deep aquafers and oceans
Sniffer would give seeds of some extinct plants. Imagine making a back from the dead kind of jungle in Minecraft with extinct trees by the help of sniffer :)
never liked the phantom or the glow squid 😭 only thing I liked for the glow squid was the flirting signs. was still confused about the allay cuz I was told it only brings back items u dropped not search for those items that u didn't want to search for. I want a golem but the Redstone golem was basically made for people who were good at Redstone and the tuff golem from my theory just moves stuff around idk I want something helpful that helps search for hard to get things but I also want a golem and the moobloom back idk
The real problem is that we even have a mob vote, all these mobs should be added to the game. This is why modded will always be better than vanilla!
I'm thinking tuft golem, but I think it's between the sniffer and the rascal. But the sniffer is probably the most likely winner.
I feel they’re really lazy when it comes to adding new things.
I wish there's one big update with all the failed mobs from previous mob votes. It would be so awesome!!
Simply put, yes. What is it? 2 words, Dream. Stans. They’ve more or less rigged the mob vote for the last few years at least, doing so via spamming the votes with bots to get whichever mob DREAM would want in the game instead of what OTHERS want added in Take last year’s mob vote for example, yes the allay is nice, but fans accepted the fact that it would only get in over the other two mobs because the dream Stans willed it to win
i just want em to add the iceologer, but one can dream
I can confirm the sniffer will have multiple sizes at least--lady Agnes responded to one of my tweets
It would be cool if ravengers fought sniffers in a equal fight
What the problem is with these Mob Votes, especially this years, is that they select one mob and give it features that (while are inherently useless this year around) catch players' eyes. This year, the Sniffer, even though it only digs up seeds, is going to be added with tons of new plants into the world while the other two mobs... just have their "skills" they have been given. As soon as the creatures were released, I could already tell WHICH mob was going to win.. which isn't much fun at all. Last year, at least the allay and the copper golem were butting head to head, but this year just seems primordially lack-luster.
Archeology is so out of place in Minecraft The sniffer better come with new seeds, but I doubt it. These mob votes have been pretty lame, and I’ve seen modpacks with more content. Why couldn’t they ever just add all of them? They have an entire studio that could work on these! At any rate, they never give enough info on what exactly would be added
....Yes. Its existence.
I swear I'm gonna cry if dream manipulates his fanbase again to get the least popular mob added again. Rumpelstiltskin isn't taking my dinosaur away from me like he did the flower cow.
My main problem with the mob votes is they feel like content for contents sake and could lead to bloat
But hat confirmed.
Hearing the mob vote options was pretty disappointing. The rascal seems like a beginner type mob, just getting some iron tools or basic items after playing a game of hide and seek in a mineshaft, which can be huge sometimes and might end up being useless after getting better items. The tuff golem seems more decorative but very limited, I can see it being used on adventure maps or server maps but that's kind of it unless it can count as a block then maybe Redstone can be involved. The sniffer seems to be only decorative too but also more flexible compared to the tuff golem but just barely, I can only see it adding new plants and generally being cool to have as a pet/mob to keep around but nothing much to add. Kind of hope all the mobs that weren't chosen come back for another mob vote where people can choose multiple or they just get added to the game but it doesn't seem likely.
I just want a mob vote where instead of voting for cute passive mobs we vote for aggressive mobs. Imagine how difficult it would be to entice someone to vote for a mob that makes the game more challenging, it would have to come with new features or something that would entice voters to vote for it. Phantoms were a bit of a let down but I refuse to give up on this idea. Small golems are cute, yes, but I want to vote for a big, mean, majestic bully.
All minecraft mob votes have problems*
I can't really say that I like the Sniffers design, but the alternative is the Rascal or Tuff Golem.  The Rascal just seems pretty bad, and whilst I like the Tuff Golem the Sniffer gives us new seeds and plants.  I just want new seeds, so I guess that's what I'll vote for.
It's rigged from the start  The dumb choice will always win.  As soon as they called it the "sniffer" it was bound to win because the name is goofy. On top of that but they promised new plants with it so it's also the optimal choice if you don't like any of them because it adds the most content
really just seems like a cash grab, this video
i like the glowing squid... its a beautiful mob..
The best one and the more "minecrafty" for me yet is the rascal, but sadly, everyone is obsessed with that aberration they call "sniffer"
They have the recourses to add them all. They should.
I just wish we could get some more golems in e game.
unfortunatly mojang is an indie company without money to fund any more than one single mob, really sad really
I actually disagree with this. Having people vote for the glowsquid because "No guys it will totally light thingsup/find treasure/hypnotise you" despite that not being mentioned was horrible. Setting a presidant that "this mob sounds useless, but might get bonus features" makes it harder to know what  your voting for. More clarity not less.
I just feel like all the golems should be the same size
the sniffer looks like its from the neither Hmmmmmm
Minecraft is literally one of the most sold games ever, why don’t they just add ALL of them? I mean look at what the modders can do in a year vs what official Minecraft does.
If mobs are the exact same as when announced they should just add all of them. In fact, I don't know why they don't do this anyway!
i just wish they would add furniture and upgraded visuals to all versions that you can choose to turn on and off and are vanilla. i wish also wee could build big boats that could move using a like a boat tool that has to be placed near water and specific item lists have to be filled. with bigger boats i feel more exploration would make sense in big sea areas. i had a cool idea of hot air baloons too as that is the ultimate for exploration.
Why don't they just add all of them?
they should do a mob vote callback made of mobs that people were sad didn't win
I'm going to be honest I don't know why they do the votes
Unpopular opinion: I don't care for the sniffer. Like the turtle, llama, and snow golem, I see its narrow single-use-ness to be a fun gimmick for a few minutes and then forgotten about until every 6 months where you go, "Oh yeah, those are in the game." Not that the Rascal or Tuff Golem are strong concepts either, but at least the Tuff Golem better fits into the world with its pre-established villager-like design.
I say we need a mob update, give the pre existing mobs we got different variants. Like we got two kinds of squids which allowed some variation. But besides like Mooshrooms and the different cat variants, there isn’t much. It would allow a collectible thing to start, having different color mobs to collect. Kinda like the axolotl. I’m not gonna count sheep’s because like, that’s something you can control. You don’t have to find sheep of those colors, you just need flowers.
Your mom has a problem
Its not just pickaxes
If you can't ride the sniffer I will cry man I just want a dino pet
The Sniffer is a very general mob, one you can see being cute and peaceful while travelling, while the other two are very niche
I rlly wish they'd go back and consider some of the mobs who lost the vote... still sad over moobloom losing to a retextured squid most players won't even see 😭 I swear that vote had to be a little inflated bcuz of mc youtubers. either way it'd be nice if they could keep quiet about what they were picking but that's a pipe dream fr
Sniffer will win I know it
I will forever be saddened that we cannot just have all the mobs
Pls let the golem win 😓
The sniffer better win
thank you m8! big 'preciation!
I wanna see the runner-up mob votes from the past in a competition
Copper Golem should have won
I also kinda hate the fact they mostly only have passive mods in mob votes, and even then, theyre bang average and dont help with anything late game
Sniffer... oh sniffer my boy
The sniffer is cute a dinosaur and helps the environment dont be like Bob be like the sniffer
Honestly it’s always rigged
They need start pushing more updates out and stop making us wait 1 year for a mid update because modders can have good and clean gameplay out in month or so. Also need more weapons, mob variation, new biomes/structure and aleast a new dimension.
They added Joe Biden to Minecraft🤣
I hard disagree. We were not told that the phantom's spawn conditions. This was a expanded feature and everybody hates it. We should be told almost everything before we vote to prevent that from happening again.
There's already so many flowers that I never use. I'd rather play hide and seek while I mine for ore or having walking item frames in my house. I'm gonna vote the rascal because I love hide and seek and it has my favourite design.
The lamest and worst mob wins every single time because people imagine it will do something it will not do
They should just add them all anyways and not even do the vote
Sniffer for the win. While it may not be useful, i want a mob that isnt small. We have so many small mobs, a big one would be cool. But a new mob for the caves would be cool too. Tuff golem is kinda cute but if it walks around its uselsss, but decoration wise its pretty good. Overall i like the sniffer the best
Why bother with a vote? Add all of them
ADD ALL OF THEM
Vote for sniffer or I kill you
0:22 I not good at english language so i dont know haw this item on screen call. But i think that Mojang redesign "This" item and probably we can see "it's new look at final trailer of mob vote under portrait of pillager (0:28)
Honestly, they all don't seem to have much purpose aside from the sniffer having at least a bit of one, which is probably why it's in the lead. I mean, what can you really do with a tuff golem? As it stands, it's nothing more than a walking item frame. Wasted effort, if it was implemented like that. The rascal is no different. Everyone already knows that 99% of the time, found enchanted items are borderline useless, particularly with villagers being able to provide pretty much the whole roster of them. The sniffer is only available rather late for its intended purpose of finding seeds and plant, but the actual interesting part is that it can unlock *new* things.  Generally, I think that there's a lot of effort spent on solving simple problems quite frequently in Minecraft and sometimes, that solution can even become completely obsolete like the drops from Phantoms is now completely useless due to the mending enchantment... hell, enchanted item finds have become useless overall thanks to this. I expect bundles for example to be in the same category. Instead of simply creating a backpack, they see the current inventory size as completely unchangeable, as it was once upon decided by the god of Minecraft that the inventory must never exceed a total of 36 different slots for items and tools... unless you use shulker boxes, of course, which are basically better than bundles, but still worse than a backpack would be, since you don't have to place that one down on the ground. Other times, they implement things that have absolutely no purpose whatsoever like polar bears, bats or pandas and the tuff golem is frighteningly close to that while the rascal is quite similarly useless.
Rascal the only good mob in mob vote
Team sniffer
0:43 this should've been the reveals
A pet dinosaur-like creature got my vote. Adding the fact that it will introduce new items is a plus. The Tuff Golem is just nice as a decorative entity, while the Rascal would only be good for the early game (if one can find it that early) while becoming as useless as bats in the late game if all it gives is stone and iron tools.
i think the issue with mobvotes is the focus on the whole voting itself. why mobs, when they could easily all be add in the same update as extra? they obviously dont have a big role to the rest of the update most of the time. imagine if it was an update vote and people could vote over different categories. for example: - farming (new crops, trees, food etc.),  - end update (i know we had 'the' end update long ago, but the end still feels dead and empty. they could easily add new mobs, end plants, ores etc. this would also open new possiblities like blocks and even tools/weapons/armor) - archeology (fossils, ancient plants, art etc)  i get this would cause a huge issue when it comes to content that would be added as the categories dont compete fairly, but neither do the mobs at this point. they're never bad, but neither are they ever amazing or anything. this would also make it so other ideas wont have to die, like whats currently happening with the mob votes.  they should also try opening up to the community more and hear what they have to say, and maybe even talk with mod creators and see what their ideas are! and with just the three categories i've given there's already a start, imagine what others can come up with! either content for the update category, or a whole new thing!
vote sniffer
Everyone explaining why there pick is the best: Other mobs: totally useless My pick: Completely revolutionizes Minecraft!   Its almost like we dont know how any will be implemented or something Also Im really annoyed that people think the mob has to be big deal to be worth adding
The Sniffer is just catering to the farmer soul inside all of us players. He already has my vote.
I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again I find mob votes extremely dum. There is absolutely no reason why they can’t just give us all three mobs. Ya, maybe not all at once, but they could easily put each creature in a different update down the line. Having us vote to get rid of two just feels stupidly unnecessary.
My biggest issue with the mob vote is that they just don't do anything with the other mobs, as they have promised, as well as that they don't  really seem to have anything to do with the updates around the mob vote itself (The Current one does Slightly with the Archeology theme) , on top of which the mobs so far have not been too interesting either.  Phantoms are just flat out annoying, specially when doing builds (and their drops are basically useless)  Glow Squids are not interesting, they are just re-skinned squid, specially since they don't have the hypnotizing thing, and they could have easily made the Glow ink obtainable in other ways Allays are cute, and have some functionality, but its also very limited, but could be used for collecting items at the very least.  From the current votes The Sniffer seems to be the only one actually 'Useful' with the giving seeds  The Rascal adds a Little minigame, which feels like it would be boring after the first few encounters, specially if all they give is some early game items The Tuff Golem are just walking displays, that are completely random, they would be more interesting if they for example picked up items and put them in a chest of something, but that's likely to much function (since Allays can do so too)   Also aside from the Rascal's 'Underground' And the Glow Squids 'Dark water/ocean' none of these are linked to a biome, it would be awesome if we had gotten the Iceologer for example to flash out different biomes some more (and that future mob votes did that too, Add more mobs to specific/Multiple biomes)
the problem is none of the mob votes are good anymore
It honestly feels like they just have some hyper underpaid guy working on the mob vote mobs. I could easily think of some actually interesting and good mobs.  Cave stalker. A spider like creature that spawns in large dark caves on the ceiling following you around with faint audio cues until eventually dropping down and attacking you. It can drop a map that will lead you to an ancient city you have not been in before, silk, fermented spider eye and a broken bone. The ferment eye, bone and some skulk can be used to brew a new potion called skulk-sensing. The potion will highlight the warden, skulk sensors, skulk catalysts, and skulk screechers.  The Dune Eater. The dune eater spawns in deserts and resembles a smaller ravager with a larger head and more deserty features as it is related to the ravager. It can also rarely spawn in pillager raids in the desert. The dune eater will fill its mouth with sand and launch it at you in the form of a large ball of sand that does great knockback (does not remove sand blocks). The dune eater is faster on sand but when it is not on sand it use its sand attack and will instead attempt to head but you. Unlike ravagers dune eaters are only hostile during a raid or if you attack it. When killed the dune eater can drop its head which can shoot out the same sand balls using one sane block from your inventory. It will do more damage than an arrow but fire more slowly. When you run out of sand it can instead effectively just be used as an iron sword.   The swamp beast.  The swamp beast spawns in regular swamps at night very rarely. When it spawns in multiple new forms of swamp themed vegetation will start to grow in the swamp while its alive. It is very strong, slow, and has a lot of health. It will not attack unless you attack it. The swamp beast drops multiple of its new plants upon death, a few random potions, and a new axe called the vine axe. The axe chops slightly faster than an iron one but has more durability then a diamond one. The axe can harvest leaves, vines, and grass without normally dropping nothing. The axe can change any type of wood into any type of wood and any type of leaf into any type of leaf.
lets hope that the next time that we can vote, the losers of the past votes have already been added to the game.
I'm still sad about the moobloom It was the best one,,
I would love an extra mob vote between the 2nd place voted from the past years and this year, so we can have moobloom I believe, copper golem and 2nd place from tomorrow
I think its absolutely ridiculous that the glowsquid beat anyone, much less such a cool idea as the ice pillagers. Forgot the name of them. But that would have been so good. We need more enemy variety. Pillagers, skeletons, zombies, and bosses are getting old.
i dont get why they dont just add all of them... they really cant make the argument it takes too much effort as these are usually made as mods within days of the goddamn vote going live.......
Why doesn't mojoang just add all 3....
I know the sniffer is absolutely gonna win, but the Tuff Golem is such a cool idea
You have three new mobs here but only one gives you new plants Illusion of free choice
I hope Moobloom will return tho :< They qere SO cute
The real issue that people seriously need to talk about is how lazy Mojang is being with the game. They ask the community to vote (which majority of the time it gets rigged in some way), and they just abandon the previous ideas, which alot of people still liked, yet they could be implementing all of the mobs instead of one.   This is why i perfer playing modded at this point, cuz even with 1.19 and the bigger underground context we got, the game still continues to lack content beyond a small amount of hours. Terraria continues to push the player into exploring, and continueing to uncover more and more and more contentthe more you dive (literally and metaphorically), and keeps you playing the game, where as minecraft... once you beat the enderdragon, the only thing left that you have left to do is just.. explore. Meanwhile when it comes to multiplayer.. its at the point where you need a good provider to run it now, decent doesnt cut it anymore for 1.19+.  I ran a 1.12 server with alot of mods that used a shitload of memory, and the server runs far smoother than a non-modded 1.19 lol. Its honestly sad to see that the modding community develops the game better than the actual creators these days.
Why dosent mojang just add all of their mob ideas???🤯
The mob vote is rigged with stupid people not thinking before voting
sniffer !!!!!
there was also a mobvote for fox vs ostrich & termites vs meerkats. the result were overwhelmingly in favor of foxes.
Idc I just want the sniffer
You know why the sniffer won? because the other option weren't that good
I still like the glow squid for the glow ink. I use them a lot! But the alley, is totally bug...well, most of the time. I have a egg's farm, since day 1, and it's bug most of the time. Even when i reset the note block...The alleys just stay (with the stack) in place! So, because they keep updating it and trying to repair the bugs...it's still pretty useless! For the 3 new mobs, they're just hard to figure... Can we trap the rascal, what kind of new plants came with the sniffer...and what's the real purpose for the last one...  it fell anoying to me..having a mob running around for no purpose! So the last one is a no for me! It's just an other cute useless mob! The first one could give the most best feature, if we have more than 2 new plants! The second one, not so sure about it! We already have good pickaxe! The only new good features would be instant pickaxe,! No more minning, just 1 time pick...  But, to be honest, any of then are really interesting! i like the snifer, because i'm a dino's fan! And i don't think i want to run around underground for hours to find ...what... a pickaxe! I'll do it 1 time and that's all! If we can't catch them, and keep them with a tag name... it's a no-no for the rascal! If they are super rare..it will be even more useless! If they give cheap enchanted pickaxe...useless... if your inventory is full...useless...( French speaker here, be nice!)
Bro your just mad the sniffer is going to win instead of the tuff golem
Expecting Mojang to do their jobs? Rookie mistake
I vote golem
Crazy idea, what if instead of a mob vote they would add the most voted on first and in the next major update another one. Crazy right?
we don't need another mob vote we need a boss vote lmao
Big time, I'll never not be mad at the lack of piss/butter cow or copper golems
I really love the idea of them adding new golems but we need one with more purpose other than just being a shelf or a button presser. I think one of the best interpretations of this idea is the Straw Golem mod, where you craft a small haybale golem to help take care of your farm while you're away or busy. I feel like there's so much more potential behind the idea of a golem companion.
Mob votes feel more like a “choose 2 mobs you won’t have”
sniffer: egg with a random mob as a side effect. rascal: small child in cave that throws garbage at you. tuff golem: item frame but made out of a different material.
the conceptual design of the mob vote just means you’re going to have a ton of people disappointed every time. With mojang having microsoft’s backing they don’t really have a manpower or resources argument for not implementing all three anymore either
I would honestly be happy as long as it’s not the tuff golem because it’s basically like the Allay and it’s just useless overall since like I said before it’s basically like the Allay :/
I hate every mob vote. It's eighter hyped by youtubers and bunch of kids overvote some useless mob or thinks that mob will be game breaking and voting for it because of false informations
What if they already programmed the community to lean towards one favorite that sounded at the end as the winning mob vote, where in fact, the briefing was put one ahead already against the remaining?
Would’ve been so cool if the sea monster won over the phantom. Back in the day I wanted the sea monster or the big blaze because I knew that would’ve meant an update for the ocean or the nether. But smh muhfuckers wanted the phantom.
sniffer may also bring ancient knowledge
Man if my picks won we would've had the squid one, the ice olliger and the copper golem.
Golem better win, imma be pissed
Honestly I think people tend to expect more that what is shown in the mob votes like the Iceologer had people claiming it could introduce ice magic or new farming opportunities when in all likelihood it would just be a hostile illager type mob that spawns in the mountains and would probably just drop ice or powder snow, so while I think the mob votes should be more content dense I do think the info on the mobs should be 100% upfront
There’s so much red stone  and decoration that I honestly think it’ll add the most to e game! Plus Minecraft needs more golems
vote for😄 the Sniffer
My biggest problem is there is always more than one mob i want to be added in the game and the one i most want to be added never gets added and it's going to be the same this year. I just wish they would add all 3 insed of making us choose only one.
But the lack of great mob choices *is* a problem as well
''Does the Minecraft mob vote have a problem?'' Yeah. The vote it self! Instead of adding all three mobs in game, they say ''we know that minecraft world is empty but you can choose only one of these''.
If dream rigs the vote again, I will cry. I'm still mad about that fiasco.
Sniffer = new seeds and possibly new items to craft. I love crops/greenery and food items, so……I choose the sniffer.
The Sniffer looks so adorable to me.
Hh
Its a shame, they are all garbage
This is the only thing i personally don’t like about minecraft. Voting on a new mob? Cant they just add them all? It would add a lot more to the game that way. It might be a lot more work but it would be worth it for both mojang, microsoft, and the minecraft community.
Rascal
Rascal
Allay and phantom are just useless.
Yes it has because no one is voting the golem
Sniffer cute
bro those animations are the goofiest crap i have seen bruh
Ikr,  mojang is ruining their games all for thrill
Tuff Golem could have had so much potential. Tuff is worthless, and instead of having a walking item display we could have had a cheaper and more plentiful alternative to the iron golem. If they really wanted to, they could have made it fit into the lore as being ancient protectors of the cities deep below before the sculk took over. They would look Mayan or Aztec inspired and we could still add a cloth after construction.
my problem with the mob vote is that it exists. Just give us the cool stuff instead of dividing the community and making us sad that the ones we wanted didn't make it. Glow squids are a perfect example of what I mean
All of these mobs seem so unvanilla. Maybe it's their color pallets, but I personally don't like any of them.
Minecraft mob votes don’t have problems. The voting is the problem itself. They thing if so many good mobs that could be useful yet the force you to pick one out off the four and you have one good one but lose three other good ones also. I don’t think the mob vote was a good idea at all
2:23 Which before it was named I thought it was like a mantaray or sting ray.
I know that the sniffer is gonna win. So I guess maybe a better golem in the future?
My problem with these mob votes is they give us less but disguise it as more They really should just add all 3 mobs, it's not like they don't have the means to do it
I hope we can ride the sniffers
I really want the rascal to win but I already know everyone’s gonna vote for the sniffer
Vote for sniffer
I'm sorry but the sniffer wins hands down and the reason why is cuz they can implement many different versions of plants in the game with this
And yet the community votes one of the most useless mob
siuu
everyone can vote... as long as you have that one app...
where is last years winner
GIVE US DIFFERENT PATTERN DOGS PLEASE
It shouldn't be a thing. Modders make much better content. Either pony up, do the "back breaking" work of implementing three whole mobs, and removing the ones that are bad, or stop making updates so modders can actually work instead of updating their version compats.
I hate the phantom
i just dont get why they dont add all of them
One thing.. i am bagating my pula in snifer
im begging for sniffler
must admire GLOW
sniffer is honestly the best pick seeing as you alteast more than one thing
rescale is the best imo. i saw a pole about mob vote an it has the lowest vote. only 9% for some reason.
None of the updates are worth my time to come back
It never ceases to amaze me what dogshit the community is willing to vote on.  Every vote had some great options and none of them got picked.
sniffer = bonemeal farm
I've seen so many comments saying "I will vote sniffer because it's cute", if it's gonna end up being completely useless it will make me very upset, cause if you look at it from another perspective, golem should be the obvious pick
I've got a weird feeling that somehow the golem would be used for duping.
All cosmetic mobs LULE
The rascals ability would be great for xp because you can in enchant the pickaxe it gives you
This mob vote dosent really feel worth it
Orrrrr add all…?
This is about the mobs, not about the voting. Boohh false click bait
The reason why I'm disappointed in the glow squid is because they don't actually "glow"
One day I'll get the mob I want in, one day
Shut up.
The sniffer is most likely the most useful one but we need a golem, I think they should bring back the copper golem next vote!
I vote sniffer because his cute
Theyve always been rigged, the mob is chosen already before the vote, the vote is a ruse to make players feel they had an impact on the game
What I don’t get is why there HAS to be a vote. I mean yeah sure interact with the community, but wouldn’t it be cool if we just got all of them?
Voting... politics... this is the game in new minecraft, you vote for someone else idea.... Im just gonna stick with the old version....
Personally the biggest problem IMO is they give so many good ideas and then cut the ones that dont win. That's so many interesting ideas that just get left in the trash. The mob vote should *really* be to see which mob gets *priority* and gets added *first* , with the rest coming at a later time. Especially since 2 of the 3 previous winners players came to actively dislike once added (phantom and glow squid), so having the possibly more interesting alternatives gone forever is just a bad feel. Its not like Mojang couldnt handle adding 3 mobs, especially with how basic most of them have been.
new enchantment?
I’m team Rascal. But I’m sure we already lost.
Tuff Golem but only when you can control it.
tuff golem is as annoying as an enderman ngl
Sniffer seems like the obvious best choice here but I’d I really like to use the tuff golem in some of my builds
I'd love it if Mojang added more static mobs that don't do much... just act as fauna in the background. And without a vote, of course.
They really should be bringing all the mobvote losers in game in a future version
Am I the only one who likes the rascals? I feel like they would add more life to the caves ;-;
I genuinely hate the glow squid, we could have gotten the iceolager but instead we got a useless thing that drops a completely useless item
Mob votes are super fun and all but it really confuses me why they don’t just add them all to the game. Like theyve most likely already made the mobs in game why not just do all three each time
Even so. Glow squid was rigged was rigged and really should not have been implemented in the game.   Last year was as fair as you can get.   But this year people vote for the sniffer for the most stupid reason. “It’s cute” you can vote for whatever you want. But I really think they should keep everything a secret and explain everything what a mob does until the livestream.   And non of the earlier mobs have been implemented except frogs and boats with chests.  They really said FU to a lot of mobs for a squid and never touched them again.   Mob voting is not done properly
I don’t like how lackluster the vote mobs are. They kinda just exist and are generally useless. I’m not saying every mob needs to be incredibly useful to the player but I don’t want them just taking up space
If minecraft adds a fruit that you eat while the seeds are on it (lika a strawberry) will the sniffer dig into my stomach and basically kill me..? Cause if so, i think that would do a TON of damage. But if you had armor on, it would probably not get through. Maybe it would get through leather armor, but who uses leather armor?
I think the biggest problem for me is why they aren’t just implemented 3 at a time by surprise. Lord knows they have the money and resources
The key problem with the minecraft mob vote for me is sensationalism.  The mobs will be announced, people will be confused and annoyed that the mobs are all lame, then some guy will make stuff up about one mob and people will get too excited and get incredibly high expectations, only to be incredibly disappointed when it’s actually put in game and the mob is revealed to be incredibly lame.
RASCAL 2022
imagine getting a fortune 3 iron pick from the rascal that could help you so much
what does the sniffer do? give you seeds. imagine if u go afk finding your game extremely laggy cause alot of sniffer took up seeds. and your inventory would get extremely messy.
There needs to be more bosses
I want sniffer
According to some Twitter posts of Devs, the new sniffer plants are only decorative
If the archaeology drain is correct, the sniffer will fit perfectly into the update.
sniffer forward, we are for you with all our heart🥰🥰🥰💖💖💞💗💓💞❤🧡🧡🤎💜💚💟❣️💘💘💖❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💝💝💞💞💞🫀
I still don't understand how people could vote for the phantom with that description...
My guess is the reason the mobs in the mob vote are a bit lack luster is because they don’t want to show cool things only for them to be voted out and scrapped forever. They let us vote on lame mobs and just add cool mobs in regular updates
I think it would be better if the sniffer eggs could only be found in the dense lush cave.
SNIFER ONLY
sniffer is the best mob prove me wrong
The Sniffer is just glow squid all over again. Like hun, it's literally just decoration plants. Git outta here. Y'all stupid for voting Sniffer.
Making glow squids apply a hypnotic effect on players in it's vicinity would be a distinct enough feature for it not to feel so useless/negligible. Maybe it's ink could also be used to make hypnotic arrows and potions.  The idea being that your view slowly shifts towards the mob that has a hypnotic effect applied to it. Your crosshairs would constantly shift (with a bit of room for risistance) towards any glow squid in line of sight since they would have the effect by default. The use of the hypnotic arrows, potions and splash potions would be to force/encourage aggro to yourself or another entity. It would feel as annoying as stick drift on a controller. Maybe it can have more aggressive tracking/wider effective range with higher level potions. Think of the possibilities:  • You could shoot a ravager with an hypnotic arrow to make nearby illagers attack it instead of you or the villagers in a raid.  • Thow an hypnotic splash potion on a hastily built iron golem to draw the warden's attention away from yourself to heal/escape. • Throw one into a group of endermen to troll your friends; making them struggle to not look at them while fighting the dragon. • Maybe you want to be the main tank in team based PvP so you drink a hypnotic potion before a fight so anyone who is fighting your teammates would have to work harder to target them since their crosshairs would keep shifting to you. Your teammates can attack with less risk of being focused/ganked while you block with a shield. • Custom maps: Puzzles that involve guiding mobs by applying the effect to a target. Or an easy method of focusing the player on an objective for during cutscenes. Parkour but with an invincible allay flying around you with the hypnotic effect.
crap animation had circles  0/10
I feel like each of these mobs have their own benefits and downsides. I feel that the Rascal adds some atmosphere to caves, but isn't exactly useful late game. The golem is great for builders and showcases, but other than that doesn't exactly do much. The sniffer to me is the most intriguing, adding a new egg, plant and possibly adult/baby variants, but the whole finding seeds thing doesn't seem that useful and only would be used for the new plant or early-game players
If Rascal doesn't win, we will never find it and will forever be lost!
Iam  the 700k view
Can’t wait for Dream or some other dickhead to use their moronic followers to screw over the entire player base (again)
The only problem with the vote is that it’s a VOTE just give us the cool MOBS damnit GIVEUSTHEMIBSAHJGCCCNNBXZZGVB  AHEm  They should’ve just give us all three mobs, over three updates, whatever, but why make us choose?  That made me not even wanna vote 😤
Well the only interesting thing about this all 3 mobs are the plants added but probably are also just decoration.
sniffer is so dumb but i guess it is a kids game so what can u do about it
I want the rascal or the golem
I have yet to see the Minecraft community make a good choice in the mob votes
Man I really don't like any of these. The sniffer is popular but I sit see why as it's pretty meh in looks and utility imo. Feels like the n ew splatfests where one side is heavily carrying the vote.
they should honestly keep the names hidden just for the sake of stopping people voting on the name alone  the copper and tuff golem seem really cool and interesting  copper golem PURELY for alot of the really niche things (seriously a block with the potential to turn into a mob and vice versa is actually a really interesting concept)
The rascal seems more beneficial for miners or enchanted items while the sniffers for survival🤔🤔
For the Rascal, I don't think it needs a unique item or enchantment to be useful throughout the game. It just needs to scale up with the player's progress (which I suggested to Jens on Twitter when he asked for feedback). Track the highest tier of armor, tools, and each enchantment as a player stat (or similar system), then let the Rascal give you a prize that actually fits your current progress, rather than always giving the same power of prize and therefore risking being OP to early game or underwhelming to late game. That would make it useful without going against anything already announced about it.
Seriosly though they copletely lied about the allay
lets go Origin Realms
Imagine having the same amount of votes, and i bet all three of them would be implemented 😂
still don't understand why they make us vote. just add all of them.
If we get rascal, that means we get free items in caves lol and it will be very helpful for speedrunners unless if rascal gives live a good item
sniffer gang
I'll be happy as long as rascal doesn't win, and it looks like that won't be a problem
SNIFFER
I wish we could have all three
Tuff has highest potential. If its solid and walkable etc, or how it holds the items or how they look,  Rascal is obsolete for veterans and newbies won't understand they need to hint it down 3 times without killing it, with no indication they're not meant to. And sniffer is useless creature which gives seeds.
We keep getting the worst mobs because people with alot of views tell other to vote for what they want and then we get bad mobs
It also suffers from terrible mob choices I mean… a reskinned turtle, a villager that plays hide and seek, and a walking totem
Yeah sniffer
I feel bad, cause I’m definitely voting for the sniffer because I love getting lore and new plants, but the rascal is so cute and adds so much personality to the world. It would definitely be my second choice but it seems like it’s not even going to get second :(
I still don't get the point of this video!
before I watch the video; Yes. Obviously.  There's been issues from the beginning with the phantom.
Every mob vote so far, my pick has been the least voted for. The game just gets more full of mobs I rarely see and never use.
Ngl, sniffer is absolute GARBAGE
snlffer slnffer slnffer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i really want copper and tuff golems to be added.
They only used the enchanted pick as an example drop, it's not the only thing the Rascal can reward you with. It's like assuming the allay could only carry cookies because that's what they showed in the showcase.
I wanted to see the losers re appear but instead we get these 3? Ohwell.
I hope they add the copper golem or iceologer next update due to them stating the losing mobs of the mob vote will be "added later down the line"
Can the Sniffer help me find my dad
the vote was rigged from the start
Honestly i dont like any of these mobs, however i feel bad for voting for the allay in the last mob vote, considering what a disappointment it actually is. I think it would be cool to have a little roaming gallery of valuable items you have collected in your adventures, which is my reason for voting for the Tuff Golem.
As much as this is unfair i still want sniffer to win
I’m still mad at the fact that Iceolger didn’t win when it originally would have if you’re certain someone had not rigged the vote
Remember how Notch added Features every week and now its like "Here's a feature you can all argue about, see you next year"
I’m just going to vote for the Tuff Golem because I know Sniffer will win anyways.
Snuffer for the win
I want the blaze mob but tankier
Sniffer Chang uwu give sniffer now 👿👿👿👿👿
The mob vote process itself is the problem. They could be normal devs and just add mobs to the game.
rascal please
Or add all of them?
Honestly I feel like they should work on improving some of things in the game that are rather lack luster, rather than adding new weird creatures. I'd love it if they fleshed out some of the current biomes a bit more, like add crocodiles to the swamps and mangroves, sharks, jellyfish and sting rays to the oceans etc. Especially the Deserts I feel like they could use a update, they could add camels and snakes and more types of cactus, perhaps one that cactus fruit can grow on.
i want the tuff golem it seems cool
Still hate dream for what happened in the 2020 mob vote we coulda had ice weapons in Minecraft but instead we got item frames and a squid I wanna put my pingas in.
oh boy! cant wait for the sniffer. finally some new plants and maybe an addon to lush caves or new biome with new plants
I just voted sniffer cuz it’s so cute 🙂
I think the problem is that most of these mobs are just so boring.
They are glorifying the sniffer so much I hate it. The seeds that that the sniffer finds grow into purely decorative and don’t add much to the game.
I hope the sniffer makes it
I’m voting sniffer he’s too darn cute I don’t go mining much 😂 I’m a crafter not a fighter 🤣
i wanted sniffer to win
I think mojang should just start to implement thing even if they are not complete. You just need to put them in "experiemntal" snapshots, so that who wants to play a stable game, play the normal snapshots, while the others can play the experimental ones. This way, they can also have more feedback from the community directly
It would be nice if they just implemented 2 since the game is starting to feel a bit lacking
i want tuff golem tbh, its the only mechanic that sounds interesting to me
The thing about this mob vote is they never gave enough details and most are completely useless the one with most details is the sniffer which is what I am gonna vote for bc it’s the most useful but for a new mob vote I want more hostile mobs that would be awsome
it would be cool if you could ride an adult sniffer also i wish they added all mobs and the winner being top priority
I voted for the sniffer because one I don’t want a mob u need to find 3 times in a cave even after the big caves an cliffs update. Two I don’t want to have a little golem walking around my house carrying items and being completely useless
What if to give the big sniffer a use, you could craft a big saddle to ride it
Players under age of 18 have ruined mob voting with their soft cute useless mobs. persons under age of 18 should not be allowed to vote!.
the first one should've been the blazing inferno, the second was rigged by dream and should've been the iceoliger, (f*ck you dream) as for the third I personally preferred the copper golem, but the Allay's win was completely fair. And as for this one, it's obvious who the winner is.
Wait, if they are feature complete and therefore already designed... why is there is a mob vote and they don't just add all of them?
If sniffer wins, I just: Find it, get the new seeds, never use the sniffer again since I can grow the plants now If rascal wins, I just: Encounter it in early game, grab something useful and never see it again If tuff golem wins, I just: Build one, give my dragon egg to him, never use any other one That just shows you how useless is this years' mob votes
Imagine the tuff golem had a feature where if you look at it it freezes but if you look away it moves. Like the weeping angels from dr who. That could ad some new ai for mods if it happened
Tuff golem seem like Allays all over again but this time they walk instead of fly, Rascal seems the most fun and even a bit creepy to find underground when it's dark. Sniffer seems like a one time thing you'd find in a playthrough and after getting the ancient decorative plant you will never bother to interact with again
“Democracy is freedom for the people but the people are.... retarded”
I’m voting for the rascal
russians hacked
people listen i have an argument against the sniffer first of all do you really want to vote for a rigged mob and also remember when the glow squid won and it was pretty useless yet yall are probably voting for the sniffer and accually all i think it does is grow large and get old seeds and i know that may sound tempting but remember that the tuff golem can make statues on builds like on stair cases on in halls and the rascal can give you free items if you simply play hide and sekk with it and i know your gunna say im am going to vote for the sniffer because you probably are siding with it but to make the the mob not useless vote for the tuff golem or the rascal i know your not going to was to but do it for minecraft
I love the sniffer i hope it wins!
Marketing doesn't realise that people need value, and value is measured in depth.
best video
3:50 you forgot about the slow falling potion, it's really cool!
They better bring that hovering inferno back or the sea thingy lol
still feeling robbed of the moobloom
No i will vote for rascals
sniffer please
The problem with the vote is that it exists. They should just give us all of the mobs...
I think that the next mob vote needs to be between the runner ups from other mob votes
Bro why evreyone loves the sniffer all he does is hatch and sniff the ground but i think rascal is good and fun. And helpful But also THE TUFF GOLEM LITTERLY JUST STEALS UR STUFF
Cool and funny!
one thing i don't get is if the mobs are feature complete and they even have the in game models, why not just implement all of them? i get the fun of community interaction but the winners are so underwhelming that it just makes things so toxic, especially with mojang saying the biome features would be added its just a vote to see what gets added first only to not just forget about it and move onto and then scrap other biome updates like collapsed logs in birch forests and fireflies but even other mostly complete changes like the combat tests.  then of course saying they won't fix sand duping until they make a renewable way to make sand and tnt duping until they implement a way to use tnt in flying machines in java, and just completely forget to do so, it's just furiously innefficient and just screams laziness to actually balance the game, like we've reached the point where we have stone axes stronger than netherite swords and mobs that either do chip damage in iron armour or 2 shot you in full netherite with no inbetween.  i would much rather another attempt at a combat update than picking between 3 atmospheric additions, because really the updates people care about are things like the nether and caves & cliffs updates where the core gameplay loop gets considerably shaken up. not the mob vote winners, frankly it's just constant drama especially with the glow squids.
I feel like the reason the mobs are feature complete is that the ones who have been fleshed out the most are more likely to be voted for. It’s possible that some of the mobs not voted for wouldn’t have been featured complete.
The allay is a soul of a tuff golem
They should’ve structured the vote from the very beginning in this way: 1. Three mobs to vote for. 2. When a mob wins, replace it with another new concept but keep the two that lost for future votes. 3. If a mob places last two times in a row, discard it _permanently._ Replace it with another mob.
I don't feel like these new minecraft mobs suit minecraft at all, maybe its just me but ide rather none of them be implemented into the game.
Here's my take: Mob votes shouldn't exist. They just cause divides in the community and no matter the result, the majority of people will be dissatisfied because their first mob of choice wasn't added, and probably won't be for several years, if ever at all.  I'd rather them just make a good update and release it when it's ready, don't overpromise features and then backpedal and downsize after telling the community you were going to do one thing, but them you actually do something else.
I don't understand why everyone is depicting the sniffer with 6 feet. When it walks you can see it only has 4 and the standing animation only shows 3 because it's the 2 feet in the front and 1 from the back.
vote for the sniffer for the lore
Like Benjamin Franklin said, "democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what's for lunch."
For the sniffer I think they should add 3 plants instead of the only shown 1 plant  The decorative plant they show  Then 2 new foods/resources.  These foods + wheat and sugar should be able to make a super consumable that fills from 0 hunger to full from eating 2 of them and come with extremely high saturation. To balance this. Only the sniffer can give you these seeds for the plants at a low drop rate (about 15%) and they would grow at the speed of pumpkins and melons
I feel like the idea of completely destroying two mobs gives a unsatisfactory feeling it forces you to imagine “what if ?” What would the game belike if the vote went different
We’re losing another golem😢
It seems like mojang is choosing the mobs not the community
When is the vote again?
Wait until someone like Dream ruin the Mob Vote
the rascal would be just terrifying. imagine mining and seeing something at the corner of your eye watching you.
the sniffer will add new plants!
The blue glowing things always win. Since there is not a glowing blue one this year, I think the sniffer is
the phantom membranes main purpose was to make slow falling potions, not repair elytras.
why dont they just add the mobs who dont win as dlc or something?
The Rascal deserves to be added, the Rascal can give you a pickaxe, so if you are mining and you may break your pickaxe and have no way back up to the surface you can go "Okay guess I'll go find a Rascal."
I hope that eventually they will add runner-ups of each vote, or at least make a vote for them
I wish we could have more hostile mobs with unique mechanics instead of boring Cutesy companion mobs.
I'll save this for you it is, Mojang is practically rigging the votes at this point because take a look at the mobs for the last like 3 votes this year the giant turtle or whatever it's called was the first to be released with more then the other two mobs interesting abilities combined the thing is found underwater in an egg, is the biggest passive mob ever and gives us new seeds, saplings and possibly bushes while the rascal you need to waste your time finding the thing 3 times which then gives you lightly enchanted iron tools and the tuff golem is a golem that you spawn but only stands still until you drop something which it then comes and gets then it returns to the place you spawned it in last year the allay won something that we all presumed would fly further then walking distance and would harvest things on its own instead we got something that gets it self stuck and lights itself on fire more then it grabs items and even when it does grab something and brings it too you it immediately picks it up again while the glare was f3 in a mob and the copper golem was cool but it couldn't and never would hold a candle to the allay similarly thing happened to the glow squid it was presumed to be something with a trance effect but it didn't instead it just exists waiting for you to kill it and throw aways it's ink the iceologier was a mob that only spawned ice above you and dropped it on your head which would be more annoying then actually useful we don't even know what it would drop my guess an emerald and some packed ice then the moobloom a recolored mooshroom, the allay was second to be announced second only to a mob we wouldn't vote for the glow squid was third so it could be the freshest in our minds and the turtle was first to be shown with the longest time on screen
Let’s simply assess this. Mob Vote 2020: 2 cool ideas, another mooshroom with flowers, to aid with making bees seem more lively and in-place, and a new illager, to make illagers feel more in-place. Plus a cool attack.  And then we have the glow squid. First, although quite minor, it was favored by content creators, second, it implied features it didn’t actually have, and third, who likes squid. The worldbuilding was nonexistent, and it’s drops were underwhelming on release.  Mob Vote 2021: more than 1 interesting concept, those 3 being a “hey dude you missed a spot” for lighting conditions, another thing that can press buttons, and an automatic hopper. All coming with some minor lore implications. Those being the fact that zombies, creepers and skeletons attack non-humans, any material can make a golem, and illagers capture allays.  Mob Vote 2022: 3 entirely redundant concepts. Entity version of an item frame with literally no other use, incredibly vague mob that gives low-high tier loot at best, and automatic seed farm. The only reason people are liking the sniffer is for 3 reasons. First, major lore implications, with it being prehistoric and all. Second, seeds are actually used sometimes in late game! Also decorative plants are nice. And third, it’s cute.
has anyone else realized that there are no hostile mobs in this years mob votes?
I well like video if you vote for sniffer
Tuff golem :)   please
Im so salty about the allay why would anyone vote it copper golem is 10x better
Tuff golem could add hats tho
I must remove delete all of this Minecraft junk off of my phone and notebook computer device because of the interfere with the other real genuine videos website that I'm paying putting on my personal playlists this takes a long time do there is alot of just absolutely crappy ignorant not even childish they aren't funny cute silly educational internment I would never allow my child or teenaged kids to sit around getting fat wasting time and disturbing Thier young impersonal minds please don't hesitate to find some kinda grow up job for yourself I believe that sort of nonsense needs to be on payed preview Chanel pay more for those who have all the time to fiddle around with insane activities
So what is the problem with the mob vote?
Honestly the tuff golem and the sniffer seems like the best ones, rascal would be annoying af, if you can switch states for tuff golem it would be excellent for decoration and building, if the sniffer only bring PLANTS it would be a major disappointment. Yet if they were to bring trees, it would be amazing for better looking trees and more wood variants
Stop making it a vote and add all 3 or none or however many, we all know they have the manpower to do so. Players don't need to have a say in the direction of a game.
this guy sounds like amalthus from xenoblade 2
All mobs are trash every vote all of them
I rather have the Rascal win that will definitely help with early game (and very likely will remain useful throughout all stages of gameplay), than the useless sniffer that does nothing but look pretty and give you useless flowers
Mojang went like "hey guys do you want sniffer the mob that can find seedS and bring new plantS to the game or the rascal or the tuff golem?" In the end people will vote for the mob the devs have already chosen.
I WANT THE COPPER GOLEM
Seems they spend more time on these promotional videos than the actual mobs…
I feel like the tuff golem is underrated
I don’t care what mob wins
We’re losing voting options
If the sniffer of Tuff Golem wins ut would be the first time a blue/blueish mob doesn't win.
U all BETTER VOTE FOR THE SNIFFER
VOTE SNIFFER!
All i want is a ridable sniffer
Everyone chose the turf golem
we can hope  but Mojang never listens to the community
These mob votes are just awfull
Mob vote
When can we start voting
I feel like the mob that got the worst wrap was the blaze inferno. It seemed really interesting and its use of shields in combat would have been fun also. I also fell like their unique drop could have been more interesting than the phantom. the mob could have even gotten its one stadium to spawn in due to its worrier helmet (though that a bit hopeful)
Minecraft is honestly boring now, all the new updates/mobs give me no interest to hop on the game anymore.
I haven’t played in years but the sniffer seems to be the clear winner
So ima explain these mobs Tuff golem-why would you want this Rascal-has potential but is underrated Sniffer-very overratted but it seems cool
It's almost like having your massive player-base primarily comprised of people that aren't game developers and don't know anything about balance choose what content you add is a bad move
Mojang: "So, today, we have three mobs to show you:  A moving statue that grabs stuff,  A goblin that lives in caves or something lol,  And an extinct creature, whom has a few remaining eggs hidden deep underwater in ruins, which you can collect and hatch, effectively reintroducing a prehistoric mob into the modern Minecraft world. This mob can dig up seeds which you can also grow. This mob has an entire ecosystem growing on its back, and not only looks visually interesting, but may even tie in with future plans for archeology!"  Yea, I wonder what the problem with the mobs votes are.
Twitter is literally going crazy and I hate it 🥲🥲🥲
You find the rascal deep underground. Where you will  be digging for ores, exploring mineshafts, caves and getting loot. It's hinted you will find it in abandoned mineshafts below level 0. Where you will get many chests with loot. And fighting off mobs and cave spiders. Which begs the question, what will this add to this active environment? It adds a gimmick. Not new content. It's a walking 1 item chest. Gee. How exciting. How often are you actually going to interact with this thing? It's not something you'll seek out. Not for me at least.   Tuff golem, potential for features.  It's a decoration. Something that displays item. We already have an item display in item frames. Although I can see it's charm as a small statue I suppose. You can also make it, so it's very likely you'll interact with it.  Not to mention it's customizable.   The sniffer will guaranteed add new items, at least two plants. Plants are nice for decoration. It adds a bit of lore to the game. It adds something to look for in underwater chests, as it will unlock new items. And something that you could have around to spice up your animal farms with some size variation.  It seems obvious to me. Sniffer on spot 1, tuff golem on spot 2 and the rascal can go back to the depths it came from.
SNIFFER YOU BETTER  WIN BUD
Minecraft 1.2 will be very cool
The rascal should have been a trash panda mob I would love to have raccoons in Minecraft
honestly with how much more information they gave the sniffer, it's like they want it to win but they wanted to gaslight us into thinking we're responsible for it's existence for some reason  i mean compared to the other two options of "an early-mid game loot dispenser which sounds pretty finicky to deal with" and "the allay again but now it can't fly and freezes up" while this thing is a giant, friend shaped dinosaur who gives us new plants to toy with, and use for food, decoration, building, or any other potential use the plants may have if they go for something with a niche use like the dripleaf again
I liked the sniffer more when I thought the nose were eyes
They have the resources and manpower to add every single mob they put on vote, but time and time again we get to see how lazy and money hungry the conpany has become
Im voting tuff gollem, very cute
The problem with the votes is that the mob i want is never voted. RIP Coppergolem.
But… why couldn’t they add all of the other mobs from last votes?
Mojang is trash  They are here to disapoint fans and drag updates for three years. Where modders doing them in one hour
I want the rascal 😭
sniffer could be op for skyblock maps
well, I don't really think I would be disappointed since the sniffer gives us new plants so its a win for me the others use items that are already in the game
why cant they ad them all
Part of the reason I believe the Allay won is because so many thought it could essentially dupe anything ("yay free diamonds/netherite/elytra/etc."), and the resulting mob ended up being disappointing, especially to all those voters who thought it would behave that way.  With that in mind, I worry that the Rascal may win solely because of the same logic, but this time it's confirmed to offer compete items.
I am soo voting for the rascal
Minecraft should have a re-vote for a phantoms game mechanics
Few thing split the community as much as the mob vote. well i guess the combat update do that as well.
Definetly rascal
They need to stop creating more mobs that add nothing really that special to the game, and look back at previous votes. Just bring those mobs back for a new vote against each other.
the sniffer better win
The shorter answer: *Y E S*
The mob vote exists so kids can have the illusion of their choice/opinions having an impact;
Imo there should be 9 options and 3 winners, it would take away from sting of losing all the other mobs since not only 1 would be chosen
Ironically the Thing Designed to bring people together tears them apart once again. Sadly the Tuff Golem is out. i wanted for 2 reasons 1. I want to build a Golem complex and be essentially a machinist. 2. Give more use to blocks that are already in the game.
all 3 are pretty much useless, but the sniffer at least adds new flowers so...
you included footage from the video with all 3 mobs, which shows the rascal dropping an enchanted iron shovel. Also apparently the devs said things on twitter about the Sniffer's plants being purely decorative and the rascal's item drops not being fully decided on
Tuff Golem’s idea is just “wha- what use could this have at all”
I’m voting for sniffer bc it would yes be better for the architecture mod. Also the rascal will be bad late game and the tuff golem us just useless
Personally I think the Tuff Golem should serve as both an item frame/helper, and as a cheaper alternative to iron golems.  They should be able to attack, but only to protect the owner, since they just wanna be your little helper probably.  Think of a nerfed and slow baby zombie.  It'd add some depth to the tuff golem, and give off the feeling of having a cute little helper.
Its a shame how people want a ravager but with a tree on it that sniffs flowers like if they were used nowdays, rascal is the only usefull mob and he could bring new enchants bro why do we want a new flower
BEANS!!!!!
golem plz
i think a BIG issue with the mob votes is we don't know what else the overall update is going to bring to the game. For example the first mob vote was tagged along with 1.13, But we didn't know that 1.13 was themed around an ocean rework until after the mob vote. In my opinion it would've have been much more likely that the ocean monster would have won the vote, had we known the theme of the rest of the update beforehand.
I think a big problem is mojang refusing to add mobs that didn't win the mob vote. I really wanted a sea monster and a blaze boss
the sniffer legit gives us more stuff! a new egg, a new mob, new seeds, and new plant! not to mention the lore it has
The problem is dream
Yes because only the cute mob survives
What happend to kirby
0:42-2:11 Sniffer has literally been on every scene. And most of the mob vote tests that I've seen it's pretty obvious that the sniffer has a chance of winning.
Many of these votes are just… two useless mobs and a slightly functional one. Sure the rascal does have a function but it just would make the game feel dull because you’re wasting time chasing this stupid creature that’s just gonna give you something you probably don’t need. The tuff golem does literally nothing, so the sniffer is gonna win. Even then, all it does is give builders new plant choices. A lot of these mobs are really uninspired, maybe next time we can have a hostile mob vote, that should definitely have a more even distribution. Either that, or a choice between a new overworld, nether, or end mob.
Why cant we have all of them 😭
They just like shooting themselves in the foot at this point lol.
i blame dream to adding that squid
Man, Minecraft mod votes would be so much better if I could just decide
based on what you said about the rascal, i think rascal's touch would be a good enchant and kinda be like an auto smelter/ auto pick up
this game needs more mobs
i miss the mooshroom :(
Hi
SNIFFER!!!!!!!!
Sniffer - worst mob for Minecraft
the rascal doesnt fit in the world, just doesnt make sense. sniffer even though it only finds seeds, is bound in the reality of minecraft. and the golem is just like way too extra
Because the sniffer isint an actual animal that exists in real life it is possible that it may drop something useful
I think it's better to expect mojang to under deliver because ultimately these mobs don't matter. The whole purpose was to drive engagement, you can't do that if you add a mob that significantly impacts the player which reminds them of the choice they lost. That causes a rift and does the exact opposite of what mojang wants.
Why don’t they just add all them
i just dont get why they dont put all three mobs in the game, i mean looking at them the mechanics behind them dont seem to be that deep so it shouldn't be such a huge task to make all three.
sniffer for the win
I want the sniffer
Funny how this issue is a direct parallel to real life voting and political issues.  Especially the part where people vote under certain assumptions that don't come true. Use this as at least a partial lesson that politicians and those in charge feel no obligation to do more than what they say to get them elected, if they even do that.
the first MV had FOUR great BIG mobs! so many ideas! (then four bioms with so many things! then three bioms with so many things!) next one? three regular mobs a simple recoloured cow, a new villager with a lot of detail (and implied lore bcus igloos) and a simple recoloured squid then: three tiny things, one does one thing randomly, one hides, one brings you things and now we got: three tiny things, one does one thing randomly, one hides and brings you one thing, one brings you things  and the promise of adding the others later? frogs and chest boats, two things from the second biome vote  I think they should rethink their whole way of handling this instead of making one new thing that does one thing to be usefull for the player(s) and throwing in some nice designs they're like designing starter pokemons at this point even
our options are a display, a mail man who likes playing hide and seek, *and a dinosaur, vote sniffer*
What's sad to me is just how slow development for minecraft seems to go, and when things do get developed on it's never quite what they said they were going to implement, with modders having to do the rest. The game has been around for over 13 years, it's had a LOT brought to it since then for sure, but it seems every new small feature takes weeks to months to be implemented and larger features taking YEARS. I mean, just look at how long it took the Nether to become what it is now with all of its own biomes and such. And yet, it's one of the largest games of our time and the most addicting.  It's a great game, I just wish the development was a little speedier. It's like a never-ending early-access game.
i want minecraft to add hostile mobs just wanna get the spice but that sniffer mob doe... i want to eat these eggs
My issues with mob votes is that these are mobs that should of just been added into the game. The vote for the glow squid was clearly rigged because of dream,  And then the fact the votes are on twitter, a platform a majority of minecraft users dont use. At least this one will be fair but still, i wish mojang would stop being lazy and implement all of these mobs
i still cant wrap my head around why people voted for the glow squid like the snow pillager would have added a new mechanic which would have been great for programming custom bosses and just a cool mechanic overall
I think the sniffer will be the overall choice. The game devs has let us down before like the hypnotizing glowsquid. But the Sniffer seems like a solid choice, its an ancient dinosaur, who does add new items and plants into the game, with unique mechanics and it could potentially open up the path into archeology updates or more ancient mobs
Please understand they can’t make 3 mobs at the same time, they’re a small poor indie studio.
We all know the sniffer is going to win
The thing I'm most disappointed about is that glow squids don't actually light up the surrounding area in different colors. That's the only interesting thing that could be done with them, but they didn't do it. They barely provide any light and they're only one color. Correct me if I'm wrong tho. Haven't played much of the new versions of minecraft
SNIFFER
The thing I hate most about the mob votes is it add politics to Minecraft's fanbase... like seriously. You get people getting mad and pitting against each other over which mob should be added, and even to this day you still see spiteful Copper Golem fans getting mad at people for voting or Allays, and the other way around... not to mention the Glow Squid... :/
There is further information on the minecraft web site like that the sniffers plants will only be aesthetic and that the tuff golem will get up when it sees a item get it and then return to its spot that it's was made.
For the mob votes i feel like most of them are just not worth the votes, they just feel so distant and don't tie in well. There definitely needs to be more use for the items like the glow sacks could make underwater torches or the phantom membrane could make waterproof redstone. Like Idk about yall but they just feel like padding to keep the game from dying. Personally it seems like they already have made everything from the mob votes but just ride the hype. Chances are modders already made all the current mobs in about a week with alot more uses than what we will get on full release. I know for certain the sniffers already been modded.
Somethings people, you included, seem to forget is that features can change. The Rascal won't only drop an iron pickaxe it can drop anything the devs have stated "we will accept feedback/suggestions on what the rescal will give". The Tuff Golem can be more than just an item display statue and as stated "Will wonder around until it finds an item then it will return to where you placed it and then turn statue state." and finally We know the Sniffer will add at least 1 new plant however they are purely decoration and these are plants ONLY the Sniffer can find.   however even after knowing this like the glow squid we don't fully know what will be and what isn't a feature of the mob we're voting for and everything is subject to change.
"The community has positively responded..." Wow, so great to hear something like that. I know it sounds stupid, but people recently just love to complain for no reason, that sentence alone just made me happy
Btw those Videos at the end of the mobs ingame are from origin realms
I really wish we had a golem update. Add the Copper and Tuff golems while also making the Iron and Snow golems a bit better.
Rascal is going to end up turning up like Glare getting destroyed by the winner :/
i always thought it would be cool to be able to dye glowsquids. Just because
Maybe they should do ranked choice voting, you pick the one you want the most, the least etc.
I really hope that in the next few big updates that they expand on the dimensions, possibly whenever they add the warden's home dimension via the underground ruin's center structure.  Hopefully then they will add the Warden Blaze and a biome update of some sort to the overworld (possibly a more natural-looking world generation?)
Man I hate the Sniffer
Make a Golem Update, such a cool concept being able to create our own life that serves certain purposes. Iron Golems, Snow Golems, Tuff Golems and Copper Golems, maybe add a few others, thinking baout it the Wither works like a Golem, add a few others that all do unique things, alongside maybe some new blocks that might go well with the new golems or some new structures.
The next mob vote probably will be Moo Bloom against Glaire against Rascal
sniffer just adds more seeds and I guess its also a pet kind of. Im not sure about anyone else but we already have glow squid which is basically useless, phantoms added a new entirely different item that is legit awesome, alley is basically a new way of not running around collecting everything, and sniffer is just new seeds different sizes possibly new trees that im sure no one would use over the original oak planks unless there's new crafting recipies that require this new *wood* I dont see a point in sniffer. Racal gives items very nice and we might get a new item for mining caves, Tuff might add new things for storage possibly which is great cause we can never have enough chests
Only care about caves   Would love to see rascal, something to look for like diamonds but game-afied
I think that Mojang should stop with this “it needs to be cute thing”. Why does it need to be cute? The sniffer makes no logical sense. The sniffer would stand no chance against any of the predators of its time. Why not just add a normal dinosaur?
To me it seems rigged. The Rascal and Tuff Golem have honestly a lot less going for them than the Sniffer. The Tuff Golem appears almost entirely useless and potentially even a hassle as it appears useless beyond being essentially a walking item frame. The Rascal has potential but it's implied it will not give you anything that can't be easily achieved within about an hour or two of gameplay. Frankly it may take longer to find a Rascal and get their prize than to get the same item on your own.  The sniffer on the other hand appears to be easy to get, can be bred, and has an actually useful ability to gather seeds as well as bring in multiple new plants which may even include a new food. The sniffer has long term uses compared to the other two and frankly looks like it was the only mob in this vote where they put effort in designing something special and unique.  Plus the rascal just reminds me of a worser version of the cave goblin mod which does almost the same thing, but you get many different item drops and you don't have to chase it down.
I actually just realized how good tuff golem could be for cheap mob farming. Since they pick up ground items, they can keep items from despawning
I desire Tuff golem
heya in guessing only a few will see this, but if it's at all similar to last time (I know it's not on twitter, but hopefully there are 2 rounds like before) then assuming the sniffer will win round 1 by a lot then us rascal and golem fans should team up for the second!
i preferred it when the mob vote was more vague, making us guess what the creature would do
I'm still so annoyed that we could have had a flower cow that interacts with other mobs or an ice wizard that would probably have unique drops and give a reason to go to ice biomes, and instead we got stuck with a glowing squid that behaves exactly like a normal squid, doesn't give off any light, and drops an item that just makes signs slightly more readable.
One thing I'm a little concerned about is the sniffer getting more votes because it will add more features (plants and seeds). This feels a bit unfair in my opinion, a lot people will be voting for the thing that gets them new items, not their favorite mob. (No hate to the sniffer fans out there, I know not everyone thinks like this).
ill probably vote for the Tuff Golem because it would be cool to have him in my base, just walking around
I honestly would prefer to see mob votes go away altogether. Every single time, I see a mob idea, get excited about it, and then it loses the mob vote. I'd prefer for Mojang to just create 1-3 mobs per update and keep them as a neat surprise for players to discover post-release.
Cope
Stop arguing it is literally made by a badger
Here we go again. Peoples whining about a free update. C'mon guys... It's gettin old.
as long as some stupid youtuber doesnt make his fans vote for a useless mob again we should be fine
They need to like, give us a snapshot with each mob sowe can make a well informed vote.
I really would have liked to see the rascal as an introduced mob. But like you said, an iron or stone pick is hardly worth the effort if you already have netherite pickaxe's.  I voted for the sniffer only for the seed/plant variant. It's a shame they do this choose one of three options scheme. Why give us a choice that really isn't a choice at all.  I would prefer that whatever is offered be implemented instead of fan favorite votes. By the way, I never voted for the phantoms, but still the membranes are a useless item because of mending.  Sigh....  The results shouldn't be surprising considering the vote is so one-sided.
I'd love to get a chance for some of the previous failed mobs to be added to the game. Maybe a vote including past losers, or something else, but I just want some of these to get another chance.
Rascal team | \/
I think one thing they need to do is only tell us what the mobs are when the mob vote goes live. This way we can avoid influencers/content creators sharing their opinions and changing what the community votes for. These mob votes should be about what the community wants not what a few creators want.
I don't get why they didn't implement each and every mob in the first place. Like Mob A, Mob C, Mob D...  It's ridiculous how they basically have these mobs which they could easily implement with hardly no effort... After all, they're a huge game studio now... And even when they first had the mob vote they were a large studio... Had it been me, I'd be able to do all the things they've done over the years, by myself. They're working at a slower pace than Notch did when he developed the game by himself. I remember the Secret Friday Updates... in which WATER was implemented. I'd say that you couldn't find a lazier game studio on the planet if you tried, even the scam ones, do a better job.
yes, the problem is that people want to vote for the sniffer
we need rascal! we need that lil guy
So basically you just wanna vote for the mob that looks the prettiest, rather than one that you know would be helpful? That seems counterproductive to me, and if the fans got to decide what certain mobs did, it would take away the joy of actually using the mob in game pretty quickly, at least in my opinion that is, I think the voting system is perfectly fine as it is, they created the characters so they should get to decide what they do, not us
the golem is the best one debate me
i think the problem is the community shouldn't vote for this stuff they always pick the worst option phantom punishes players who stay up at night which in its self is already a challenge. glow squid the most useless mob in the game. blue fairy never seen one and see zero useful reason to look for one. sniffer is a cool mob but dont see any point after you have a garden so late game he usless.
poor copper golem
Tuff golem feels like the weeping angel
minecraft 1.91.1 is a no go zone for me
The Rascal looked so adorable.
Just put them all in. There's literally no reason to cut planned features from the game. They've put time and effort into planning/designing these mobs so add them all.
If you all vote the sniffer ima kill all of you...please I just want another golem in the game please...or else...
my question is why they still didnt add the giant squid and blaze looking creatures to the game, they have so much potential to be new actual bosses since we currently only have 2 main bosses
I think (if minecraft were to have a final update) they should add all the losing votes into the game. It would be so cool for 1.30 or whatever to add all these mobs that many people wanted before.
Imagine if we could vote for, Sharks, elephants or lions
The sniffer is best mob, no mob will ever be better then it, VOTE SNIFFER!!!!!!!
The sniffer one is the ONLY one that makes sense in minecraft
should make it that every 4th year there is an additional vote for every the 2nd most popular voted thing from the 3 year before
I just want a new golem already geez.
I don't get why a company as big as Microsoft needs to choose between 3 mobs, mod developers do this stuff for free. They seem so timid with adding stuff to the game. The main thing minecraft needs though, is just the ability to connect to your freinds worlds, like literally any other game, having to host a server is annoying in a game they keep raising the price of, while much cheaper games have always had it as a feature.
A problem with the mob votes is that they all serve no purpose half the time, like if we got a new hostile mob it will be the worse thing ever to have been implemented, the phantoms, or completely useless, glow squids, he need something for the end rather then thr over world
I'm voting for the tuff golem because we finally have a use for an otherwise useless block.
I just realized tuff golems pull their torso out and use it as a platter for items
It’s literally just whatever YouTuber gets most views/most subs forces their fans to mindlessly vote for their mob.
I still don't understand why Mojang don't just add all three mobs into the game, like how lazy can they be ? Terraria with their smaller team adds undreds of new items and mobs in each update and Mojang can't do 3 ? And it's not an issue of Java vs Bedrock because Terraria has got multiple versions of their game as well and they can manage it.
The problem with the mob vote is that it's never a challenge, because there's always one mob which is really clear that will win, makiong the vote itself pretty much boring and frustrating for player like me who would like the tuff golem to be added.
Tuff golem for the win
I want my boy tuff golem to win
The is literally called MINEcraft... So a mob related to mines would be a bit more true to the origins of the game
the Sniffer is a decorative mob with a  decorative lot (in short, it is a useless mob)
i hate every person that voted for phantom 😑
Why the glow squid bruh
RASCAL SOLOS
Minecraft is one of the biggest games, and the fact they force their community onto different sides, and end up disappointing 2/3 of their community (sometimes because of swayed votes)  I personally hate mob vote and think it’s lazy. You can’t add more than 1 mob every few years? Meanwhile mob makers are creating entire universes.
At this point they should just add the 3 mobs instead of making a vote or add the most voted first but still add the others later on. 1 new mob is so little that you lose interest so quickly, especially if its the mob you didn't want to see. I don't get why you would plan 3 mobs just to completely scrap 2 out of the picture. It's a shame we won't ever see some of the greatest mob ideas.
Why not add all 3🙂
It would be soooo cool if the tuff golem could only move when you're not looking at it
Sniffer is great
i fell like the sniffer could give a ton more decorating stuff and also a cute pet
instead of voteing for mobs, they should just all all 3-4 mobs
This video was 7 Minutes of saying things already known. Just clickbait
idk about you, but i use phantom membrane all the time for potions and they help me not die. so i do like the phantom
I like Phantom and Glow Squid. Glowing Text on signs is amazing.
Tufforever
The sniffer is literally begging to be added. It’s literally a dinosaur! Who wouldn’t want a prehistoric pal in their base?
Till this day I haven't seen or used an Allay 😐 copper golem should've won
They should put only biome/dimension votes instead of mob
The worst mob added was the glowsquid yes even worse than Phantoms
I would honestly have there be no mob vote at all and just be happy with whatever they add, instead of disappointing TWO THIRDS of the entire playerbase
This is not a problem its called democracy
Blazestorm should have been added. Justice for Big Blaze. ✊ 😔
No the bad thing is YouTubers use their influence to sway the mob vote to their favor or just for fun
These votes also are someone job. Whoever made the sniffer probably thought about it more and is gonna get a big bonus from work if it gets chosen in the vote. The second will probably be the rascal. Those golem sucked. Someone won't lost their job but jeez they needa work harder next time.
This actuallymade me realize i could use tuff golems asa lazy mans tool storage, i just yeet my tools in y base when i dont need em for abit, still on sniffer gang but its an interesting thought
JUST GIVE US ALL OF THEM WHY VOTE??
all three mobs seem like good choices. if one is to win we won' lose out on the others purposes
Pleeaaase let the sniffer win, New plants would be so cool
know whats cool about the tuff golem we already have them they are called the armour stand and item frame
I voted for the sniffer
Man I just want a golem buddy
i despise the mob votes. they only ever create drama and cause rifts in the minecraft community. it’s annoying and painful to watch people bash each other over some pixels every single year. mojang needs to stop doing this and just put the mobs in the game.
To looks alone I’d have gone for the rascal instead, but chances are I’m gonna vote for the sniffers because it has much more potential
I wasn't around at the beginning of minecraft, but it seems to me like this is pretty similar to a problem I've noticed with Minecraft recently. Where Mojang only pretends to listen to community, but consistently doesn't actually listen to anything the community wants.   It's very clear at the community hates the mob votes, and like you said the mobs are pretty shallow. Like I get it but I really wish they would listen to us
The sniffer looks cool, but would be an absolutely pointless addition if it means we can’t have the rascal or the tuff golem. They should rather just give the pigs that ability instead then, although I would love it along with at least one other mob.
All mobs are not great they need to add something that doesn’t annoy players but gives a huge challenge like the warden my favorite mob so far cause if ‘more items=more boring Minecraft’ I think we should stop asking for loot
What I don't get is. A single modder can make a tons of mobs, but a big company can only make 1.
I feel like the golem is just an alley with a different name. For the sniffer it feels like a good idea but we can already have seeds. What could be the new seeds/plants? They could just already add different foods. And the rascal seems like a good concept but like in the video they said it would just be for early games. Why can't they go back to some of ideas they had before?
Sniffer: " *seed* "
Sniffer
Meanwhile modders: I’ll take your entire stock!
The devs still have time though so hopefully the mod that gets added is expanded upon by the time the mob releases for example instead of the plants being useless (other than for decoration) like if the sniffer plant is a tree you can use the sticks to craft tools and the tools will be better because of the unique sticks.
Let's watch as a famous youtuber tells everyone they voted for the rascal and it wins by a Longshot.
the problem is that the community always votes for the worst and most boring mobs
I want sniffer!!!!!!!!❤❤❤
Vote shouldn't exist in the first place, it endorse toxicity between fans and unfairness... They can just add all of them, that's a lot better than sacrificing or scrapping idea that has a lot potential
To be honest rather than one mob why not make it so the votes mobs are grouped together?
i really ike tuff golem
SNIFFER IS MY BELOVED!1!1!
Tough
I really don't get why they don't just add them all 3 though
I wish there was no vote and they Simple added everyone of them
Sniffer is a bit adorable
Oh GOD I haven't seen your channel for a really long time, I first discovered your channel when u made the 1.9 update video  Wow I'm so impressed of how far your Channel has come, your voice sounds nice as well!
Come the hell on, why do they make a vote just give us all three dam it!  Mojang creates strife for no reason!
Idk why is mojang being so lazy to add all of mobs... they are all good why do we have to choose which one will be added? Those mob votes are one of most useless things i have seen in a while! Add all of em!
I actually thought about it when these mob vote trailers released, you basically vote for the one you find special, but nobody else does or if you are lucky, vote for the mob that everyone loves.
There also was a vote for the Golden monkey, the crocodile and the panda. Panda won, duh.
Why can't they just add all of the mobs?
I want all of them
Oh no Microsoft have to add their 3 part update with 1 new mob soon
it's so bizarre to me how people get excited for artificially limited content lol.  If you give 3 options as a company it means all 3 of those are probably easily implemented so why limit it to one except to hoard content to drip feed it
Sniffer is like the key for archeology update
vote sniffer
I voted for the rascal
I feel like the sniffer is just gonna be forgotten in the game 😢
Press like for Sniffer.
None of these are very good
The glow squid was just a copy paste of the squid with some changes.
my only problem is that the mob vote is done in twitter.  we all know the people who camp twitter.
The glow squid was more of dreams doing, the iceologer had more of a chance of winning
I still haven’t watched the video and my answer is: yes certainly the minecraft live is broken
I would love the tuff golem since I just think its fun, but the sniffer has so much more to offer so I know I won't see my lul tuff golem, they need to make the mob vote fair
the sniffer is trash, why do people like it.
lol i didnt even think about archeology but ye makes sense
they havent even stated what the thing or things the rascal will give us other than the enchanted iron pickaxe so there isnt enough to go off of for that mob. for the tuff golem it only will wonder around your base holding an object, which basically makes it just a living item frame. the sniffer adds something new to the game, not rehashing old stuff.
If terraria had mob votes: Re:Logic: ok choose! Us choosing one mob Re:Logic in the update: yes we added all of them in the update
I just wonder if  Tuff golem carry TNT , we can light it up 🙂
yes.
please just don't vote sniffer
They should make a deep sea update where we get a lot more stuff in the ocean and some more mobs and animals
Real question     WHERE IS THE FRICKIN’ BUNDLE
I want to vote sniffer
How did so many people miss that the rascal dropped a shovel while they were showing all the mobs
I want the goddamn moobloom
Yes because we choose the most useless mobs and actually think "Hey this is really cool they'll have uses in the future" but in reality they're just a mistake
Problem is they don't tell you enough about the mechanics. Like how am i suppose to vote.
The Rascal
I am for rascal
Yes
Agreed
Always got a bit annoyed, with how speculation seems to be the primary factor, in determining which mobs ultimately win.
👍🏼
mojang could just add a 2 pixels mob like the fireflies and everyone would vote for them
The sniffer is beautiful
I kinda feel all these mobs are a bit out of style for minecraft. What I mean is, up to a certain point, all the peaceful mobs in mc had real life counterparts and it was the hostile/neutral ones that stepped into fantasy. Now minecraft is slowly turning into a full fantasy world, which is not a direction I'm personally interested in. Feels like it's leaning towards the vibe of fan made mods.
i feel like we should be able to play with the mobs on a experimental server a few days prior to vote day
Imagine if tuff golem could be used with redstone
I dunno man, these choices are pretty damn weak. My friends can't stop meming the Sniffer as Joe Biden.
I have a completely different problem with the vote… why does it even exist? is it because they don’t have enough time to create all 3? hell no! these mobs are beyond simple- especially the glow squid one- literally just a quid without a single change in AI- and making item “glow” like the endermen eyes are old stuff too- so it’s just a reskin. individual modders have created better, more complex and more interesting mobs than these these mobs in the votes are mediocre in comparison so they absolutely can code them all in the models even take less work! hell I can make those models in a single day half a day if I try hard so why are they even making people pick only one? it’s not like they are making 3 different wardens or ender dragons like mob AIs which would require real effort is it for marketing the game? because if so it will only attract the attention of people who have already played the game!! so why the hell does the vote even exist at all???
The tuff golem could have literally been a remote controlled enderman, being able to connect redstone circuits or traps whenever the player needed without having to move themselves.
I swear Minecraft’s fan base always choose the wrong mob. The only defence I see is that the Sniffer will be great for “lore”…. Mate it’s minecraft who cares about lore.
Fun fact: the sniffer has ears
Woooe. I'm happy that the sniffer is in the lead, but you have exactly no own input and just talked filler stuff the entire video
One thing i hate is how trivial this mob vote is, the original mob vote basically had 2 new bosses, a new flying mob (first overworld flying mob), and whats basically a grindstone, 2020 one had the glow squid, a new unique pillager that looks like it would be fun, and what looked to be like a new version of the mooshroom that looks interesting, 2021 was starting to be trivial with basically a f3 check light level, a button pusher, and the allay, and this year, everything absolutely trivial, basically whats probably going to be 2 more vine variations, a walking itemframe, and something that gives early game loot in late game areas, every year, the mob vote gets more and more trivialized with nothing that would effect gameplay, hell the phantoms could be ignored by literally sleeping
Yeah, it has a problem… the mobs are all trash. It really is the lack of great choices. They might sound great in theory but they’re all more or less useless and unnecessary.
A good way the glow squid could have used the hypnotising abilities would be that when its near you, it will slowly force you to look at it and slowly turn your vision blue
Wasn't the glow squid supposed to give some kind of nausea effect because of glowing particle, but they scrapped the idea? And honestly banning mobs is just dumb, for instance they showcase the tuff golem which is good and shows they want more golems, but the other mobs are way better so it's not going to be added. For instance sniffer is better lore wise.
I feel like having seeds from the sniffer for plants is less worth than having stuff from the Rascal underground. I really prefere the Rascal
My biggest problem with minecraft mob vote is that they abandom the other mods get abandoned....and never cameback
the problem is they do it on twitter
also, dream ruins a majority of them.   “ILL FOLLOW YOU IF YOU VOTE ____.”
i am still pissed that the glow squid won over the Iceologer
glad hes winning
My crappy take: The Mob vote is stupid and arbitrary.  Mojang should be a powerhouse pumping out content like we've never seen before, yet it take them forever to give us an unfinished update (What the hell is happening at mojang). You have ideas for content, implement them. Why starve us like rats in an addiction experiment so we can fight it out trying to get the last mob vote morsel.
Oh no, the billion dollar game backed by a multi billion dollar company can only add 1 mob per year, such a tragic story 😢
Ok but, just the fact that you have to spawn in the sniffer means that it will add so little to the game in terms of atmosphere, if you want it, you can spawn it in, but you won't just find it roaming around which would be 200x as cool
rascal is the best
I don't even  like the sniffer He just literally exist At least tuff golem(the one I want) is cool
I love how majority of people in the comments are smart asses
Designwise, Mojang cant design meaningful systems around the new mob since they only have a 30% chance for each to actually be added. Sure, they can do so in retrospect, but that limits their design freedom and means they have to shoehorn the mobs in
My opinion of the three mobs are as follows: - The sniffer is heartwarming and adorable and is a good alternative for a passive mob than the previous MooBloom which is just a retextured cow, most of all it adds more to the ambience of the environment. - The rascal is fun and is looking to be a lot more interactive, they play hide n' seek with you and to me it adds more on what you can do in caves other than mining, fighting mobs, carving tunnels. I picture a scenario in which you follow a rascal that leads you to the deep dark. - the tuff golem is mechanically confusing, they look like good a.i. companion for displaying all your belongings like artifacts you found on your adventure but I feel it is clashing with the already implemented allay
Minecraft has a unique way to mob vote
The Sniffer has more going for it compared to the other two, it's design is unique with a lofe cycle from cute babies to adults that could potentially be the largest passive mobs, they have lore potential due to looking like some of the fossils found in the overworld and they might potentially be part of an update that brings forth new plants.   The Rascal might mean an update with mineshafts cause current mineshafts would pose more of a danger to it, than the player. And asides from getting an early game pickaxe I'm not sure what else it offers.  The tuff golem is a moving item frame which is cute and might mean new tuff blocks variety.   No matter which you choose you can't deny that there seems to be a biased towards the sniffer as it's simply more fleshed out.
The biggest problem imo is that what we see isn't guarenteed..the hypnosis shine, the hats, ect. Stuff we see in the background isn't likely to be added nor things they wear like the diving suit and fins. They show so much to spice up the look of the videos that simply will never be added which isn't very honest! Most people vote off what they see in the videos which is another problem. The glow squid they were honest on the site about it that it'd do nothing..no glow no hypnosis just a retextured squid, no one read it of course so everyone was disappointed they voted for something that wouldn't happen.
lets be honest, the votes for that squid was more or less persuaded by a certain youtuber, if not for that incident, the ice pillager could have won
They do so little so I don't see why not add all because uts kinda lacking in variety anyway
how about they just add all the mob ideas. . . . . .
ngl someone is going to make an SCP 682 texture pack for the sniffer
I not and inglês só base plis and not id
Your voice is so soothing🥰
blaze guardian > all mobs
the rascal can go die. the sniffer wins.
I want the tuff golem to get in
Rascal IS cute for me
Isn't the phantom membrane used for a certain potion?
i was disappointed at life for minutes because i vote for rascal and i'm sure rascal won't have a chance to win
Haven’t watched the video yet but to answer the question yeah the problem is that it’s too easy to vote for the sniffer and too difficult to vote for the other 2 mobs.  EDIT: after seeing the video yeah I agree with the main point.
idk who  even uses ally its useless
What I don't understand is why tuff? why not deepslate or just stone
How bout just putting all mobs instead of doing a mobvote
This is dumb why cant all the new mobs be added
I’m not happy all I wanted was the cooper golem it’s like an oxidising stuck in place and still alive you can build like old type builds whit them as statues or soldiers that died and can be revived by axing it it’s just cute useful for farms and builds
I don't really blame the community for voting a mob (except for what happened in glowing squid). It's really Mojang's fault for giving so little information about them
"Endless fan arts"  *intense shaking*
Vote for the sniffer
When you were mentioning which mobs have gotten voted into Minecraft before your vergot about the goat
Why not just add all 3?
I hope they do a farming and food update
I think they should have two votes. One for the mob and one for the next release.  Either a previous passed mob or a new one.
I’m just glad there was no floaty blue thing
Yes, the problem is that all the new mobs look horrible.
give us all of them mojang
It would be neat to see a mob vote between adding a new ordinary real life animal. Like an ostrich, or a snake, or a grizzly bear, or something. Idk. Maybe just some normal birds for a better atmosphere while outside/in the woods. That'd be nice
What i hated about this voting is we only get to choose ONE  They hype it so much for one Mob only, and the other Good options are just left to void or something, Billion Dollar company can’t even add more to the game 🙄, and this things takes forever as well, i’d get it if it where a Biome or something, but a Plain Mob? And they can’t even add more than 2 for most of the time? And what this mobs does for most are so little, i mean imagine there were no creepers in minecraft and creepers where part of the Mob voting just to do one thing.
And a sniffer is probably going good
The only way I would vote for the rascal, if it included a bag of sorts and could only hold up to 9 tools.
The part of the phantom that it would spawn in a pack if you have not slept 3 days, we did not know about that when voting for the mob (or the info was out there, but not really shared), only after the vote it became known.
I think if they give just a little less for details, then they have room to alter their plans a bit before it gets added.
To the people who wanted the glow squid shouldn’t be able to vote again
re: "Seeds" and "Plants" plural - I don't think you can assume the sniffer comes with at least two seeds or two plants. There are items like "wheat seeds" which is a single item which has a plural name. And "finding seeds and plants" could refer to finding the one type of seed multiple times. Or we could be looking at a situation like Tropical Fish, where there is one type of plant with random generated variations.
Can I just have my tuff golem plssss I wanted the copper golemmmmmm
The biggest problem is that it's a *vote,* and they're dangling content that isn't *ever* going to be implemented, and shifting the blame off themselves onto the community.
Next mob vote, Mojang should bring all the mobs that lost and let the community choose from those. I really want the king blaze and the deep sea monster be added into the game.
I think my issue is that these mod concepts and ideas are so extremely simple that there's either no point in adding them, or no point in not adding all three at once. Like... Why is it only one? Is dev time really that scarce? Why even do it at all, then?
these mob choices are far worse than previous ones unfortunately
I want iceloger but not a glowing squid which won because of dream
I hope dream rigs the mob vote again,and maybe sniffer will lose after the raid
I hate that stupid dinosaur >:[  I WANT A NEW GOLEM AFTER YEARS I DON'T CARE IF IT'S A LIVING ITEM FRAME. THINK OF THE BUILDS THE BUUUIIIIILLDDDSSS!!!
The only reason, I would want to vote for the Sniffer is the new plant. The only reason, I would want to vote for the Rascal is because it's the only one, that seems obtainable in skyblok, and because it gives "an item that will help you mine", which seems to have changed to just "a prize". Because the word stalker/stalking was used, it gets additional negative points. The only reason, I would want to vote for the Tuff Golem is because something about it being able to switch between block and entity in a more interesting way than sand, but still in a completely unknown way.  HOW TF AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE A DECISION BASED PURELY ON LACK OF KNOWLEDGE!?!?
Glow squid was a mistake
I don't want a radical game change tied to a mob, glow squid was best
IMO Mojang only added Mob votes so they can give the community a chance to have a say in a mob but it was designed for simple easy mobs and I think Mojang intend to keep it that way.
This has been my problem about the mob votes in general, none of the choices add anything substantial to Minecraft even if all of them were added. So far, the only addition that has been truly unique and had any depth was the Warden.
Ngl, nice video, you do point out important thing, to not expect anything beyond what they said. Now tuff golem looks even more depressing as stakes are it may really be just a walking item frame
Little bit of speculation here:  Sniffer finds seeds for new plants, cool-cool, pretty nice. But what if it will also find some "ancient seeds" that would grow into the future expansion of the "Sky Dimension", something like in Jack&Beans fairy tale? Hmmmm? :3c
Tuff Golem
If it grows from seeds, it can be farmed! So the Sniffer has the most player utility!
"Here are three cool mobs, two of which you'll never see again! ☺"
So... what's the actual problem? o.O
sniffer is gud boi
Mojang listening to the community? Lmao, I don't think they're gonna take that advice.
I lowkey wanna vote for tuff golemns just because they're so frekaing cute. But I know that the red turtle's prbly gonna win cuz they promise a new seed (which in hindsight DOES make more sense). Still, tuff golemns...
"Usefullness" :I
They should do a loser vote next year. Vote to implement one of the mobs that lost in the previous years so we could still get one.
it just looks like we aren't getting another golem ever
Tuff Golem would've been an amazing thing to have in the game, just like with the copper golem or the Blaze King, each of them would be amazing to have.... But the community is super disappointing and chooses something with beauty over functionality, though, 2 new plants is functionality, it isn't a cool function, overall, I think Mob Votes should go away honestly....
The sniffer is clearly the best choice…
I’m curious why living creatures need to fundamentally change gameplay and the like. Can’t they just be a cool thing they add to have more things in the game? Sounds like people actually want new red stone things and not creatures
Personally why not have a mob vote of previous mobs cause i know i want to see some the others appear.
inb4 the sniffer is a huge dissappointment and the new plants are just a couple of new decorative flowers.
We need the rascal >:( it‘s so frickin‘ cute!!!
idk why they don't just do all three? it can't be that difficult to code into Minecraft if mod makers can add hundreds in a single mod
I cant believe that they added joe Biden
Its great for my garden.(sniffer)
i want rascal😢
I just noticed that sniffer has a dog like ears and sniffer's eye is under it. they yellow thing is the nose so basically sniffer is just a big dog. more reason to vote for sniffer
I know we all gonna vote rascal if it gives or drops the backpack, player need backpack to increase inventory space so much. But for now I’ll go for the safe vote which is sniffer
The tuff golem always leaves me scratching my head. Why? Why would you want that? It doesn't do anything, its just an item frame with legs.
The problem with mob vote is a alwaqs obvious winner. Each time we had one that was better by a notch. Only in Iceologer-moobloom-glowsquid vote it didnt happen.
i want snif boi HE GUD BOI
It doesn’t have a problem, just vote for who you want, that’s literally what a voting poll is. It’s not rigged, you’re rigged.
I'm honestly kinda glad we're told exactly what we're getting. We didn't know anything about the Phantom basically, and now it's the most hated mob in the game.  I'll admit tho, with passive mobs, that isn't as big of an issue, but I doubt Mojang want another phantom.
tuff golem!!!
I feel like if they implemented them all and said "ok go play with them and pick one" it would be easier since we'd get to see them all first hand before we choose but that's probably too much
I just want the Tuff Golem to win because Minecraft has a sorry lack of Tiny Robots. This one’s for you, Copper Golem
the whole idea of minecraft mob votes is kinda flawed since most of the audience are impressionable kids with no knowledge of game design
Glow squid is pretty useless rn other options werent bad...   Thanks, Dream.
Mojang should also just outright release a statement asking popular content creators like dream to not try to influence the vote with their extremely large audience
honestly feeling like the real players dont even care about the vote and say just get X mod, like we used to do before with more creatures to add turtles and snake... also *cough* backpacks* . am talking like some years ago. I say we should just stick with old mobs and let modders take care of the rest.
I agree completely. I see no harm in them sitting down for a few more days and thinking up some fun new secrets to add in along with what was announced. There are so many choices so it shouldn’t be hard.
rascal might have added a new enchant that leads you to structures? maybe?
The glow squid is very misleading, the animation makes it so that the person is hypnotized by the glow squid but this was never implemented. It doesn't make it any better with the fact that it won because of dream stans.
They are adding stuff not quick enough, make better biomes!!!!!
I think the Rascel would actually be the best because of the interesting behavior it will add.
I think rascal deserve more, the most useful mob out of the 3 mob vote
its funny how every single time, the community is great at choosing completely worthless mobs
Maybe people love the sniffer because it's cute and we know kinda how it works, and we have less info on the other mobs
They should released the mobs on the day of the vote so no one has time to "influence" the vote
So we have a surfaced mole, an itemframe that you will lose and a stalker that will propose the worst trade offer memes like: you find me 3 times | I give you stone eff 1 pickaxe
i hope sniffer or tuff golem wins, i wish all of them would be added tho :(
OMG I want the sniffer get added it's so cute ^^
Most of the new mobs are super shallow imo. Imagine if instead of randomly picking up and moving things the new golems could be programmed with a language like scratch to automate things around your base. Image if there was another flying mob that could be mounted and grant a slower version of creative flight - perfect for builders. I think that any new feature that doesn't flesh out or assist with building, mining or exploration is just over-hyped eye candy. Though I'm sure Mojang does this on purpose so that mobile/console ports aren't overwhelmed with features that are difficult to use without a keyboard and mouse.
it would be cool to ride the sniffer or place chests on its back, these chests could have more room then something like a llama or donkey so if you only want to move a couple items fast you can take a donkey but if you want to move a lot more slowly you can put a double chest on the sniffer. And llama are easier to get but you need multiple to equal a sniffers carrying capacity
About that sniffer its just have chance not every time its gonna find seed
I hope sniffer wins the vote
All of them like a mad
Sniffr = ♡
My problem is simple, I find the fan base to be overly toxic when it comes to these votes. No,  don’t use some scapegoat, after the Phantoms, it feels like every vote has people throwing a fit over an add-on mob that could easily be removed and nothing would change, Mojang can fix every scape goat and I guarantee people will still be mad.  To make it short; Mob Vote to me is the equivalent of a hour long video of crying babies, I hate it and wish it would go away because then I’ll never have to deal with it again. I don’t care if Mojang didn’t magically do everything right, because it wouldn’t have made a difference with the toxicity.
I just want to know what the sniffer plants are gonna do, it would be stupid if it was just decoration or food because we already have SO MUCH OF THAT, everybody is simply voting it because the lore and how it looks but nobody cares about the actual usefulness  honestly this years mob vote is awful
I think it should be the sniffer I really like it so cool❤
They should just add all of them
you missed a mob vote
They are such a rich company. How come some modder in his moms basement can make all 3 mods within a week? We should get all the mobs
It would be cool to do a mob vote with the runner-up mobs so they get a second chance. Some of the votes were really close after all!
Mob votes gave us phantoms and glow squids..
if they bother to flesh out all these ideas, why not just add all 3 and maybe have the winning mob voted added with some extra feature, that way we get to enjoy all the options as well as having a bonus for the community favourite.
Snifer teammmmmmmmm
I honestly hate mob votes. Truthfully, just add them all. Maybe a vote to see which comes first. These only serve to further splinter an already heavily divided fanbase. And with how poorly Mojang continues to handle their PR strategy as of late, I don't think it helps in the slightest.
I don’t think adding all the mobs is a good idea. It’s completely stupid fan service and eliminates the whole idea of a mob vote. What I would like is to see mob votes that contains only the mobs which lost previous votes.
I thought teasers weren't supposed to actually tease what the next update would look like? Like how birch forest still looks the same
All 3 seem like phenomenal additions
We need more info about the rascal... I mean bundles are interesting, but the mob itself, is useless right now.
If I had an option I would rather have 2 good picks next year. When they revealed Sniffer I was like "Ok, new plant and passive mob, whatever". Then they shown Goblin Villager and Walking Item Frame... what they even do?
Yeah because the other new mobs that didn't make it into the game are left in the dust
Sniffer will win. It's too capybara-like to lose. And capybaras pull up, hop out at the after party.
Let's be real. The Rascal and the new Golem are useless.
I think what you're really saying is that two of the choices give us far too little and so are mostly pointless. I actually really want a new golem mob but the tuff golem gives us too little to vote for.  The Sniffer is better. Maybe could have more but is far more fleshed out than the others and so can't really lose
I've got a solution to your problem!  What if the plants we get from the sniffer are totally useless?  What if they don't include fruit or veggies to eat, ingredients for potions, have any technique to them that makes them unique, nothing?
I think if the sniffer win they probably add archaeologist or for rascal are bundle idk
For me. My time playing modded makes me think of thr tuff golem like a sort of void hopper. A allay that instead of picking up 1 specific item picks all item types up.  However the information never states or stated how, when, or why the tuff golem would drop its item.
It would be cool if there was a glowsquid kraken in the game, and the glowsquid was a hostile mob that could take control of other sea life to attack the player.
Coppergolems, mooblooms and a bunch of others I really want to be vanilla but there’s heaps of moss to add teen in
the sniffer
In my opinion they just need to stop the mob vote altogether and just put a boatload of love and effort into 1 or 2 really well designed mobs
The problem is that on votes the most useful mob will win. Every mob would be nice and would be a nice addition to Minecraft but the Tuff Golem would just end like the Snow Golem(built it one time and then forget it) but is nice to have and the Rascal is only useful in earlygame. But it would probably a fun mob though and would make the mineshaft more interesting. And with the Sniffer you can make probably a new farm, new plants for decoration and the biggest walking mob(probably). And sadly That's why we will never see the other mobs.
sniffer
I don't like the mob votes because like this year, all of the options are super boring, and the designs aren't fun either. The creeper is an iconic Minecraft mob, but the allay is recognized by recent players only. They're overcrowding the mob count and not even making it fun.
Sniffer
I like the rascal because its genuinely (sorry for long comment btw) beneficial to our journey underground but I'm voting for the sniffer to see what kind of benefits the sniffer can give or the plants it'll add it's unfair the rascal was explained entirely but not the others
I just hate their voting system in the first place....like they could literally add all of them if they really wanted to but nope.
Now I'm sad that the tuff golem isn't like a weeping angel situation
my biggest problem is that they had already decided on what the community would choose by making the sniffer be the most feature complete, the most interesting from a concept side, and clear on what it would do while the other two are described in more broad terms. it's not really a vote when the devs have already chosen what would win
i think that last point you made is the most important. the disappointment has always come from the total disparity between the fan speculations and the actual result.
I really hope the Seeds and Plants the Sniffer finds have any actual use, i will be extremely disappointed if not. Previous Mob votes have yielded some very poor choices.  I find use in the Tuff Golems, would really love if you could program them to return to the spot they were standing on and drop the item, this would be great for farms as it could drop items into a hopper.  The Rascal i see absolutely no use, its cute but useless. The likeliness of getting any item worth the time digging to the depth it spawns and chasing it appears to be slim to none.
Is it just me or do the mob votes seem really lame lately? As of late they’ve just seemed very uninspired, most mobs provided in these votes have lacked much purpose or functionality, like fr this year we got to pick between a moving item frame, a hide and seek buddy, and a mob that smells plants… imo the rascal is honestly the most fun idea because it brings a new mechanic, imo plants are pretty well fleshed out in the game and I’d much rather see something more combat based. Imagine a new boss or a new Ilager, etc
The sniffer might be one of those fossils you can find.  I NEED THE LOOOORE
i would play the game again for atleast a weekend if the tuff golem got added
rascal: probably bad lightly enchanted iron shovel tuff golem: ... sniffer: more new content    I wonder which one people want more
I mean it's not like rascal or tuff golem is gonna sniff my balls right
The sniffer would be the first mod to Come from an egg that we would place not throw like the chicken eggs
How to vote?
Sniffer lookin like SCP 682
0:43 hi QDAndy!
I think a problem is actually the mob choices what good use are the golems we’ve seen so far they’re just kind of bad, the rascal is cool and so is the sniffer but one of them seems to have a lot more use in the game for the whole thing
I wish they were smart enough to just add all of the ideas to the game to keep it interesting and have players play it in their worlds for a lot longer.
My problem with Mob Vote, is how just straight up bland ALL the mobs are, so I never vote for any of them.
I don’t play minecraft very often, but I think one of the issues is that the animations are completely different from minecraft’s style. It makes them seem cool and amazing, but it makes people forget that it will be completely different in game. At least this happened with the phantom; it was be interesting and unique in theory, but when applied to minecraft all we really got was an annoyance. Same with a few with the glow squid, as it looked like it was gonna decorate the sea and maybe even have a hypnosis feature, but what we got was an ugly recolored squid that we would kill not for the drops but instead out of disgust and pity
man I hate phantom and glow squids alley is okay but I think it was the best  of its vote but I do still hate squid and phantom too much
Its just sad that we have to vote for a single mob, why not more than just one, cmon its not like they can't do it right ?
right now on Originrealms the added the 3 mobs its a server
while I feel the whole thing with seeds and plants is utterly useless and will likely be forgotten about within a month of being added….. the other two options aren’t that good. A statue that randomly moves and a mob that has specific spawning conditions that may not necessarily give amazing loot.
They always have been a problem with the Minecraft mob vote there are 3 mobs, (one will have a gimmick or be useful in one specific way, one will appeal to the grinders/progression, one is collective the worst one.) I hope they soon have one where it's older mobs from previous mon votes
Honestly I really wish they would just add in all three of the mobs it cannot be that difficult there are Minecraft modders out there who do so much more work and put in so much more stuff than what Minecraft does in a single quote on quote major update💀
What I find the worst part of the mob votes is that they never return to those mobs even though some feel unpolished like the Phantom. The Phantom could have more added too it given its an undead mob and Phatom Membranes I could see possibly be a trade for a cleric villager or possibly be able to be able to make something new other than repairing Elytras and making Slow Falling Potions. The Glow Squid had its part shown where it could be possible that the screen could possibly be stuck on the Glow Squid as a sort of challenge when it shows up, but you can look away if you try enough times, although that could be annoying, then again its one of those passive mobs I don't really care about as its just a squid so not much needs to be done. The Allay meanwhile is a mob I find annoying as both other options are more useful overall such as the Glare helping find the spots of darkness when you are not torch spamming and the Copper golem oxidized into statues, while the Allay is a mob that was almost exclusively useful for only Redstone and technical minecraft and even then prior to 1.19 farms are still more commonly used as the Allay is, atleast in my expirence, harder to work with than villagers. The Allay may be able to be held on a lead but I have actually found due to how they pathfind, they are one of the easiest mobs to break from a lead, simply not a fan of it ever.  The new mobs are the first time where I feel they all have equally positive use unlike the mob vote from when 1.17 was announced where all mobs then I felt were kinda useless tbh. This year I feel is net positive as early game and late game players can usually have some way of use for these mobs if they are of the technical side of minecraft or not. Starting off with the least likely to get in, The Rascal has a loot table likely still being worked on, as Bundles are likely to come, they would be likely to be in the Rascal Loot Table more often than dungeon loot pools, plus we then also get Iron tools as a possibility, likely being a sort of dungeon loot you'd find in the Nether, so early to mid game is where the Rascal will likely settle as something useful. I feel that is where its downfall is as it exclusively helps in singleplayer or SMP style servers so the more fun server kind of players would not vote for it and as it doesn't help in building or in technical minecraft, the rest of the community doesn't have the highest opinion on it. Moving onto the Tuff Golem, I like the Poncho Golems, well I like all mobs in this vote and want them all but still, It is critisized for being a walking item frame as its mainly of that sort but we do have confirmation on customization and implications that they can have a designated spot to return too, so minigame players would probably be the most intrigued followed by Technical Minecraft while Builders would have the least use as they still have a mob state and aren't statuettes. The Tuff golem is simply faulted due to the aspect of the Mob vote IMO as its a harmless mob like the Glow Squid, it would have its uses but against the likely candidate to win, it will lose easily. The Sniffer has a lot more connected too it, seed and plants, plus unlike previous mob votes all three can be expanded upon but the Sniffer has the most given its ancient past aspect. Builders will find uses for the eggs most likely, same with technical minecraft but on top of that builders will have a major addition in plants for cases like Terraforming and items of building that need naturallistic looks. I just hope with future mob votes there is a sort of equal standing among all the mobs like this one.
what if sniffers pick up loots from the ground? rascal will dig out for seeds? and tuff golems will steal your chest? i think it'd be cooler if there are chest looter mobs in the game
What if the rascal gives the bundle
also the minecraft mob vote this year is a conspiracy thats meant to give the illusion of choice when in fact the winner was predermined
I read the title, and before I even clicked the video, I said yes.
golem top
I want the tuff golem
GIVE US THE COW
We all no the sniffer is gonna win by a landslide and im ok with that as a ng as I get my new plants. PLZ A FLORAL UPDATE THEY BETTER NOT GO SHY ON THE NEW PLANT CONCEPT
SNIFFER VINNER ALLT! SNIFFER BABY
The rascal is the speedrunners mob when trying to get diamonds on 1st day
I think the next mob vote should be with some of the old mobs from previous votes. maybe take the second place winners from the past 3 and give them a second chance. With how much love the Moobloom got, I can see it winning
Just like the allay, the first thing they saw they’re picking.
Dream on his way to make his fans to choose the worse mob
My issue with the mob vote is that the mob that wins isn't based on any factors that contribute towards improving the game. The Glowsquid won due to false information and being a passive mob that would be "less annoying" than the Icologer but more "useful" than the Moobloom The glorified Vex reskin won because people wanted to exploit it for mob farms, despite the other two options being blatantly more fleshed out or interesting.  The people influencing the votes aren't interested in adding anything of value to the game. Quirky "demonstration" animations and vague ideas of how the mobs works poison any actual voting process since no one can actually test them in-game first.
I think the main problem like you said is they don't add more or listen to the player base....
Vote for tuff golem!!!!!!
Mob votes are pointless, they should NOT be decided on by the community. Situtiations like the glow squid will happen over and over and over again. Instead of being lazy and only adding one. They should add every single mob in the "Vote" and not let the community decide.
I can imagine the rascal knowing the dangers of the deep dark trying its best to avoid skulk and the warden.
sniffer sure is a force vote
Being able to program the golem would be amazing. Like using simple turtle language in a book you give them. Anyway, I do hope the sniffer and seeds/plants idea keeps going, if it wins, with new seeds added each release. That could lead to a whole new mechanism for cross-breeding seeds/plants. Still want my double-high corn crops.
I hope that the sniffer wins cuz its a dinosaur
Wouldn’t be funny if the sniffle can dig up a Wells since technically it’s a extinct plant in Minecraft
stormfrenzy watchers have you ever lied, stolen used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? Still think your good? According to God's law, you're guilty. But wait, God loves you, he made a way out. God so loved the world that he gave his son (Jesus death on the cross) that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Please think about it. Repent/believe before it's too late. Luv you
I think it's a massive waste to not just add all of the Mobs, how are they going to sit there having these mobs created and fully functional and then throw them away because the Mob didn't get voted for.
I dont understand the point of the sniffer. You get seeds, which are hands down the easiest thing to get, which I typically have to constantly throw away stacks because they drop SO FREQUENTLY. I dont need something that only gives me more of something I dont want. Maybe if he made crops grow faster that would be cool, but no, another mob with a useless mechanic. >.>
We're all voting for the Sniffer because they said that it would mean new flowers, which in the end means for new content and the rest provide nothing but decoration in the end
The mob votes always have problems.
it's a shame... from what i can tell the Sniffer will win, but I really like the tuff golem and the idea that they could be toggled by redstone may be a good idea. plus they'd help with easier item sorters. (something that PE, and console players need)
Bad options
It's because they don't have top put in the effort on any real content updates anymore because everyone just installs mods now by actual dedicated creators
Rascal have to win
Yes yes yes yes the mob vote has a major problem. I'd love to see all the mobs this year in the game and they practically brainwashed everyone to like the sniffer immediately when I really like the rascal and tuff golem too! I honestly feel brayed by Mojang over and over this year and then they pull this with the mob vote (again, unsurprisingly). If they're gonna spend time developing those concepts this far they could at least add them to the game or if they absolutely must have the vote then make some gameplay footage as proof of concept not a promo style small video :(
Noooooo I want rascal because it’s the name of my dog that died 😢
Amen, John 3:16 For God so loved the World that he gave his one and only Son, for whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life 😁
Sniffer
Wow, new plants, I can't remember the last time in survival that I've sought after a specific plant to decor my base with, that's insane, I better vote for the mob to to get a new plant, and seeds, wow, I love farms, the amount of times we all run out of seeds is insane, sniffer has to be one of the most revolutionary mobs out there, because nobody would every want to bring their builds to life with a living statue that displays items, of have some kind of mini-game when mining, nah, the plant thing gets my vote, because I know that I enjoy swimming in the ocean looking for those ruins covered in gravel just to try and find a chest with an egg in it, just like how I enjoy getting attacked by the drowned, and getting pulled down by the magma air columns, such a great idea, best one out of the 3 if you ask me, and I definitely am gonna use this mob and totally not let it sit in the ocean where it belongs.
Sniffer: gives us a face to the fossils seen in the game, and while not adding much still adds at least the bare minimum of new content in the form of new plants  Rascal: sounds more like a chore to interact with only to be rewarded with something you'd more than likely already have if your that deep underground  Tuff Golem: overglorified pedestal
I think the sniffer will be like the allay where it wins but the tuff golem comes close behind like the copper golem and the rascal will be overshadowed like the glare
If the sniffer wins than no
My problem I just want more enemies
Sniffer is best, yall know it too
Whenever a mob promises to come with more features than the others is probably the one that's going to win...
The phantom membrane is also used for potions
yes. yes it does
Next Mob Vote they should add a new cattle mob. And I use cattle to mean like farm mobs. Mobs you gather together and breed to use them for their materials. Maybe goats. Not mountain goats but just regular farm goats. And they can yell. And maybe we can use them to get a new type of milk that you can put into bottles as well as a new meat type and even the horns but these horns don’t get used like the mountain goat horns, rather maybe using them as a decorative block or a new kind of light if we combine them with a torch.
Yeah I’ve seen multiple YouTubers do community polls and the top one was always the Sniffer
The sniffer looks like to corrupt and twisted forest colors:)
Honestly the sniffer is cute and will give more decoration plants for houses
In my opinion they should just add all the mobs in the game. Mobs are what help make the game feel alive. Even though some of these mobs have been pretty lackluster, I don’t think that they are necessarily bad mobs, they are just not as good as the others a lot of the time.
One of these days i hope they make a “tying up loose ends” update, where they implement most if the promised or hinted at features from past mob votes and other places.
I am sorry but you shall vote for dinosaur bud
If the sniffer wins I’m going to kill every single sniffer in Minecraft
The sniffer is perfect for farming
WE NEED TO AVENGE COPPER GOLEM
Sooo... basically every mob from now on is an Allay?
Honestly out of the three the sniffer is the only one that actually sounds beneficial especially if it would  come with new plants.
Honestly something I feel with these mobs in particular is that they're ALL useless.  Like..  New DECORATIVE plants, 1 or 2 at most.  Enchanted iron, gold, MAYBE diamond, which at best is negligible.  And.. moving item frames.  ??? Wow.. so, useful..?  At this point they shouldn't even bother with another vote until they actually bring something GOOD. When are we going to get another mob that actually has a damn use or a purpose instead of being a glorified reskin of something basic that'll be forgotten in a week?  At least the allay had function, but I have to admit as much as I love that mob.. like these, it doesn't bring anything good that's NEW.  Also why do most of these mobs look like they belong more in a mod and not in vanilla minecraft?
I will never forgive you bastards for letting that stupid allay into the game. Literally haven't even seen it once.
Something I’ve always thought is why not just add all of the mobs? It would make it so much more fun and nobody would be disappointed because they didn’t get the mob that they voted for. Obviously they wouldn’t be able to do mob votes any more, but I would much rather have a bunch of cool mobs than one maybe cool mob
We already have so many plants. We need more golems and this is the door to get more
They definelty gave a better pitch for Sniffers(One thing is to not give info, another is to give enough info to make players excited at the possibilities that are certain: Sniffer was given a lot of this, were as with the Rascal and Tuff Golem they gave so little info that we can assume what we saw is all there is to them- aka. not exciting players, aka. ensuring most will go with the Sniffer out of pure 'hype' value.), which is really a shame cus I think the hidden gem here is the Rascal.
Imo, no--yes mob votes do get influenced by content creators but there's not much to do about it other than no longer make mob voting democratic. However I think personally the mob votes should be on a rank system so say Sniffer gets #1, Tuff Golem #2 and Rascal #3 (example) I think the Sniffer should be added in 1.20 as soon as it comes out and then Tuff Golem in 1.21 or 1.22 and Rascal in 1.23 or 1.24 assuming the community still recognize it as a part of the game. It's the only fair way to give everyone what they wanted whilst still having influencers still influencing the mob vote and everyone gets the mob they want.
I will vote for the sniffer to get new plants
Has everyone forgotten about fox and goat winning in a vote?
I  think the sniffer will end up like the evoker looks cool at first but after a while it just becomes a thing in the game that people wanted because it looked instead of actually being functional for all we know the seeds could super rare and even then after you get it then what's the use long turn oh cool a flower, that will likely won't get used like most of the previous mobs in votes
There should just be a test server of some sort that ppl can  test and see which they think is most useful and have more info for there vote
I see a pattern, blue and is annoying.
I don't really like any of these mobs. The sniffer is the obvious choice, though I feel like the tuff golem fits the game the most. Unfortunately the tuff golem just seems like an item frame + allay, nothing new. The sniffer at least comes with new plants. The rascal both doesn't feel like it belongs in minecraft and seems very underwhelming featureways.
What is the point of having a mob vote anyway? I mean if you are gonna give them 3 mobs to choose from why not just save resources on creating the mobs instead of the mob vote so nobody has to complain and they can not waste ideas. Like having the mob vote is basically just saying Hey we are gonna tease with some things with little information and then throw them away instead of just using the time we took setting this up to add all of them instead.
WELL IA ANSHABA HEBSSBJSNE AND SOMEOTHERS BUT SUSHW WOSJSKWOWN MYN!
Bro like what happened to vultures, ostriches, and meerkats and the changes those biomes were gonna have, LIKE IT"S BEEN FOREVER.
i feel like it would be really cool if we could place certain items on top of sniffers, like maybe a chest, crafting table or furnace, basic things
he forgot about the goat in the sequence where he named the mob votes
ngl I think the mobs that have won in the past have been boring and I have not interacted with any of them except the phantom and thats just because they are annoying.
the more and more logic is used the more I have to agree with the preliminary votes. sniffer is the one that's obviously gonna win, my guess tho is that the tuff golem is the one to be voted out first. seeing out all three it's the most useless mob.
People want content. If the rascal just gives old items and the golem holds stuff, that isn't much content. However, if the sniffer adds new seeds, plants, and even a unique way to find it. Not to mention it seems to act like a pet. The golem and rascal may have some of those features but not all of them.
rascals have bundles on their back
VOTE FOR SNIFFER!!!
SNIFFER IS BIG COOL!
this isnt the problem with the mob vote the problem is the fact kids always follow youtubers orders and choose their favorite so we keep getting useless mods I think Minecraft should end mob vote and just add all the mobs from the other mob votes and then work on new ones
I really don't want the sniffer to win, it just seems so useless, I mean like all it gets you is some decorative plants and maybe a mediocre food source. And to get it, you have to go searching underwater.
I stopped playing a few years ago, and I'm 24 now. Im very dissapointed with the direction the game has gone in and is still headed in. Back when Mojang was still an independent team un-associated with Microsoft, the updates that would come out would feel well-thought out and interesting. Now that Microsoft is in charge of final-say, and lead development- the updates since have felt very childish in nature, irrelevant or simply a desperate attempt to add exciting content.   New mobs haven't expanded the lore of the game, but rather further distorted it and turned into some fantasy/make-believe feel.  I miss the "old days" when minecraft felt more realistic and well thought out. I used to be in love with this game. Now I just follow community creator updates from time to time to see just how much further my favorite childhood game has been bastardized.
I feel the sniffer is pointless, why not just add more plants. Oh and lets be honest it'll just be forgotten and not really thought about.
Which mob are you voting for? Im Voting For Sniffer. Like This Comment For Sniffer. Dislike This Comment For Tuff Golem And Reply For Rascal
I was so pissed when i voted for the glow squid and later found there was no hypnosis capability. i was hoping it would be like the mesmer from subnautica, instead we got one niche item from a useless creature.
Yeah no, I consider any mob that loses the mob vote essentially dead. With little likelyhood to be added.   Its such a shame, specially when the mob that wins turns out to be extra forgettable.
Phantoms are assholes.
What would be insane if there is a loser's lap every year where random previous losers of the mob vote have another opportunity to be added to the game before being gone forever
I really just want useful mobs, ones that add to the gameplay. The sniffer was the best one in my opinion since it added a new mechanic and an new thing to look for when mining. Glow squid just doesnt do anything for the gameplay itself, it is just there
the big sniffer looks like a dinosaur
Tuff golem=weeping angel
Good vid ty
Plus if they don’t add something new them people are just gonna make mods to add all of them
I hope tuff golem wins
I want the rascal to win He wold bee very iusful and fun adition to the game
Does no one points out those plants in the sniffer seen... they are not actual items, unless coral can’t turn white, or auto places itself universal the water level.
The problem(s). The mobs all seem lackluster due to the developers barely providing any info of the mobs. The mobs all seem to be useless with the less useless one being the rascal. They seemingly put the vote in favor of a specific mob (specifically the sniffer) and basically rigged their own vote.
How about they have the rascal steal one of ur items and they give you more of the item like stealing one enderpearl from you and you get rewarded 3 more of it and stealing a iron picaxe it gives you a enchanted diamond pickaxe
how does a wocky chocky donky dog win against free item man and walking statue?
I need the sniffer.
Imo the current format is alright, but they should make a feature-complete demo and show ingame footage of the mobs in action.
Sniffer: Turtle but worse Rascal: Walking Minigame Tuff Golem: Grounded Allay   Take your pick
The Rascal is so cute ☺️
Why does everybody assume the Rascal will ONLY give pickaxes?
i just realised that behind the gold part of the sniffers face is his actual eyes, and ear
To be honest mojang needs to either go back on the old mobs that haven’t been added or listen to community because a lot of the things they come up with isn’t good enough (?). Like when they added horses to Minecraft because of the mo’creatures mod.
It feels like they made this one just around the sniffer. It feels like the sniffer should’ve been mandatory, and excluded from the vote. Additionally they aren’t really thinking about what players want. You’d think they’d take a look at popular mods and try to get inspiration from them. Every time they’ve done this it’s been a massive positive change to the game, rather than just a gimmick that gets forgotten. Examples of good mobs would be: a crafting golem, a mimic or a mountable wyvern.
I just want to ask why the rascal is so underrated, I’m angry
The problem is too many golems
i dislike the allay and the current mobs in the vote. they dont feel very minecraft too me
I hate the mob votes because most games will just add ALL of these mobs in one or two updates, making the game feel more alive. Minecraft just tells you to pick your poison and deal with it.  Also, they said the sniffer MIGHT add a new plant. MIGHT. I can already tell it'll be like the fireflies. They'll lure us in by saying we MAYBE will get a new plant, and then they'll go "Well, it wasn't final" and give us a sniffer that just gives us wheat and pumpkins.
man I really want the tuff golems lol. They just seem to have so muted potential for adding fun and life to a house or base.
Gooooo tuff golem!!!!
You forgot a mob vote.
No way I forgot about you for years now I finally can see your vids again 😃
Now that I think of it, every mob vote was controversial.
I like the sniffer the most
Vote for the sniffer
The sniffer is just like the glare the rascal is a gigga chad that gives you gifts in the caves
I need a sniffer plush
Im sick of these votes as they dont ever seem to add the losers. The voting system should only determine the order of their implementation. Though I dont like some of the options shown and rather them never see the light of day. They still offered new content and variety. And some of these new things are rather boring and I'd have loved to see something more out of them. But eh. This is the direction Microsoft went and theres nothing that can be done to make them do anything different.
Sniffer 2022
The problem is that people only want useless things. The rascal has huge in game uses but everything else is more aesthetic
I kinda wish the Tuff Golem was popular in lead, I like the idea of displaying items in a more fancy way, item frames are literally flat and small, and armor stands dont come with arms in Java, and it's nice to have a neat lil buddy that just wanders around, that's not a pet following you   People may say they like the Sniffer, but since when did people really gives a damn about plants...
I wonder if the mob vote could have categories, like "gameplay", "out-of-way", and "customization". You would be presented with two to three mobs per category, there are three categories, and they would all be voted on during the normal vote time. This would allow Mojang to show clearly how they are going to implement certain mobs, so players don't vote for one mob expecting it to be "gameplay" oriented when Mojang just wants to keep it as a "customization" focus.   For example: "Gameplay" would be for mobs that offer a path to bring new materials into the game (via drops or searching like with the sniffer, phantoms, pandas (they're kinda a median mob) etc); and the materials would be limited to those needed for gameplay as opposed to "out-of-way" which would feature more laborious mob drops/ mobs (like the rascal, warden, panda, ally) that aren't needed for survival but are offered as alternatives to basic gameplay features.   Finally, "customization" is for the mobs that simply exist to make the game more enjoyable on a aesthetic scale (glow squids, tuff golems etc). They won't be expected to have much function compared to the other two categories.   From there, they can implement the 3 winning mobs in order.   Probably not the most clear explanation, but hopefully it gets the idea across.
I think there all bull but im vote sniffer to get ai giants in levels, wish they bring back the ai for the giant zombie as well.
I'm gonna be honest, I didn't mind when the phantom was added, it's not that hard, just use a ranged weapon, or go in your base.
On twitter they said the rascal will also be able to drop other things than pickaxes. If they communicated that in the video, that would change a lot.
The rascal is adorable!!
I can't wait for everyone to regret voting for the sniffer when they realize they just voted for new plants and those are often uninteresting.
Bundles never left technically. Just got hidden to where you're only able to get them in creative.
I'm under the impression that we don't really get what we vote for. Plus this voting crap causes division of the community. Give us all of them.
sniffer is boring and useless
sniffer?>>>>
My problem is tying features to certain mobs. I want new plants but would prefer the Tuff Golem mob.
Soooo, what was the problem?
To me it just seems like an unfair competition. The sniffer overall brings more content to Minecraft than the other two. Instead of making the mob vote one-sided for the sniffer, they should have had a vote something like "Golem Vote" with only golems or "Unknown vote" including the sniffer, rascal, and something else just to make it less unfair in voting terms.
Next update has to be the arqueology update
I asked in  one of the mojang mob vote vids about the tuff golem being activated with redstone and if its possible to give it a set path like a runway model at fashion show and no response which as I said would change my vote completely cause it opens so many more uses for it like a moving display for you items/ interactive display or a shop keeper bringing and item to a customer. or have it set off pressure plate and trip wired in redstone build like dungeon mini games, the list goes on. As I said this would completely change my vote and I know of many others that are the same but as said we haven't heard any more, that why I and others are starting to think mojang is playing favourite with the sniffer. like come on, they knew all they would have to say is this mob brings new plants to the game and everyone would jump on it. they could just add the new plants no matter what mob comes to the game 🤷‍♂️
That tuff golem animation makes me want a weeping angel style mob in minecraft now
My main problem with the votes lie with the fact that they give so little info about the mobs that if feels like people vote for what they could be but not what the are. And this is ignoring the fact that we’re forced to pick one despite mojang having more than enough man power to add all 3.
I think the mob votes as a whole are a flawed concept.  Players get to decide on three mobs which are in the design phase and lack necessary information.  Ultimately it doesn‘t feel like one mob won, but rather that the community missed the chance to get the other two mobs forever. There is always that aspect of losing.  And regarding the mobs that won in the past, the designs seemed quite shallow. Glowsquid is basically just a reskin.  The concepts don‘t really add a lot to the game (except the phantom which introduced a need for sleeping, which famously backfired, since its one of the most annoying mobs)
Honestly was really bummed out when the glow squid was released without a hypnotic status/vision effect. Hoping that the sniffer doesn’t let down.
Vote sniffer 2022
Hmmm cool
It would absolutely love if MC brought back older concepts and losing mobs.
Why is no one talking about how the rascal could be a great early game way to get a good pick, I mean, the tuff golem is a sentient item frame, and the sniffer is a animal that give seed that will probably get stuffed in a chest. Edit: enchanted
They should add the first and second place votes to the game. That way it keeps all but the smallest portion of players happy and adds two new mobs at once
I WANT THE TUFF GOLEM!!!
When it says "plants" it could easily mean that it produces multiple of one unique plant
The sniffer is soo cute I hope it wins
Cool animations
DONT REMIND ME OF THE BLAZE MINI BOSS
Can't they just add stuff? I hate this crap. I miss when Minecraft was just a couple guys making a game... this all feels too clean and corporate, the live event animations, the announcements, the chat moderation...
The shame of it is, I actually loved tuff golems too. I’d love it if there were little “servants” around your base that you could customize. It’s a shame they don’t really add a lot, because I’d love it if more golems were added
I WANTED THE GOLEM😭😭😭😭
I think I would pick the rascal because that would be cool to come by in a cave
I'm voting rascal but I've given up entirely on this mob vote, don't even bother voting, too many popular people have said sniffer and nothing will change their minds, sad to see such a waste of a unique and promising mob... such a shame...
I remember a time were i was happy when a minecraft update would roll around and the mods were the best part even if it was something simple like a lama and i loved the mod vote we got to choose 1 mod to be in the game but then i lost the mob we got was the worst one and then it happened again and again and thm one more time and now i dont like minecraft updates half of theme are just an update were chould have gotten 3 years ago now i just use mods i dont care for the crap that mojang puts out or who wins the mod vote its over for me
S N I F F E R
Rascel is so underrated Just look at his face it’s super cute if he popped out of no where it you would not really have a second of creepiness. But the things I like about the sniffer is the egg process and that it is a dinosaur. But the face is a bit creepy if it came up to you when you turn around or out of nowhere. Your choice though no pressure.
At first I hated the sniffer. I still don't like it's looks but I really like it's functionality after this video. I can change it's look with a texture pack but I like the idea of a land mob much larger than the player and the addition of new plants (useful for decoration). Yes I have done a 180 on my opinions.
Mojang soon enough will be getting loot crates-
These all seem awful, why dont they just bring back the older mob vote mobs? Worst of all people are always voting for the worst ones. democracy was a mistake in minecraft
Im voting tuff golem for hats!! Join me
The thing that bothers me about the mob vote is that often times the presentation can be incredibly vague or just straight up misleading. The glow squid is the perfect example of this last year, the video showed them getting hypnotized by it which many people thought was going to be somewhat of a real feature (after all, subnautica did it well!).   Also with this years mob vote it’s so clearly biased to make it so that the Sniffer will win, not only did they give the sniffer way more detail and intrigue in its description, they also promised to add other new things along with it (unlike the other mobs). The other mobs were also obviously nerfed to hell to make the sniffer the obvious common sense choice, you have the rascal which gives you a probably completely useless item after way too much time investment, and the golem which is literally just a goddamn item frame.
They should do a mob vote for every second place mob like chillager, copper golem and whoever comes second place this year
The fact these Mob Votes create more Minecraft discussion and overall more excitement for the game than any update would disappoints me.
I like the idea of adding more to mines, but I would rather get something new other than a picaxe
I'm voting for the sniffer
Minecraft no longer listens to community feedback.
i saw a guy posting about how the Sniffer looks and aligns a lot with one of the ancient skeletons you can find. He has 3k subs from what i remember, his post kinda took off after.
word
what the worst part about it is, the racsal and tuff golem are repeats of the glare and copper golem, so either someone at minecraft really wants new golems and a passive cave spawn besides bats, OR they know those two didn't win last time, so they included nothings/nobodies in the running so nothing was lost when the sniffer won.
What if the mob vote goes in the opposite direction where the mob with the most votes won't be added to the game while the mob with the least votes will be added instead?
5here is a good chance that 1.20 might be an archeology update cus sniffer is ancient, tuff golem is basically made of stone and the rascal lives in caves
I feel like it’s just kinda too little. Referring to the last one with the allays and copper golems, we got 3 new mobs which offered very little in the grand scheme of things. It feels less like we’re getting something worthwhile, and more like some random new thing to keep us happy as a hold over.
Imagine the next mob vote is a golem based vote, we already have 2 golems that could be in Game, it would be cool to see that one day
To be honest, I hope the Sniffer doesn’t win. I would like the Rascal to win unless the Tuff Golem has some level of control. I just think the sniffer isn’t that good for Minecraft, like when’s the last time you used carrots or potatoes instead of meat. I think they’ll end up adding it only for everyone to not use it.
The problem is 66% of voters will be left unhappy.
Yes, Not clear enough information, to easy for big YouTubers to change, not balanced enough mobs because some mobs are just better, and the Minecraft community is split into survival building ext so whichever part of Minecraft is the biggest practically decides the mob
the biggest problem is that they aren't blue enough this time
I actually think leaving the mob votes more mysterious is a bigger problem than being explicit about what will be in each new mob. It's not a real choice if the choice lacks key information.  "Would you like Mob A, B, or C?" is an irrelevant choice if you don't give any info about any of them. The more info you give about them, the more informed and thus meaningful the choice is.
I think someone actually made a mod or something to demonstrate the hypnotism idea behind the Glowsquid, I saw a video about it, but I forget who did it
Personally, I'm not really a fan of the new mob vote. When I first heard about the names being leaked, I felt that the names were very generic, but after seeing the videos, I wished I was proven wrong. I feel like there's a bit of developer bias in the videos since they had more ideas/concepts for certain mobs than others. I know they were trying to be mysterious and vague with what they want to put out, but if they add stuff that draws more attention, people would prefer to choose the one that the devs prefer. Plus, some of their ideas they said can be related to existing features. Take for example, the mechanic for the tuff golem is basically the allay but can't fly. They really should consider how an entity can be useful for certain levels of progression rather than picking a random feature for just one thing. If they were more objective and had themes when making these decisions, the mob vote would be better.  However, there are set backs from what I've thought. People can get into arguments and would be upset if their choice doesn't get in. And sometimes they can get into horrible situations. Making a choice without getting into controversy doesn't always seem to be a possibility. And with the past mob votes, I do think mojang fears of getting into these problems.
The problem I see here is that either they're giving a better presentation of the sniffer's characteristics than they are the rascal and the tuff golem, or they put a lot more effort and care into the sniffer than the other two, and it's showing. The other two add next to nothing to the game, and while "decorative plants" isn't much, it's better than "next to nothing." Either the design team or the PR team, if not all of Mojang, is clearly pushing the sniffer, with the other two intended to lose.
people are going to choose what adds most to the game
I just believe they could make them all but they be too lazy. Its a game made of pixels.
SNIFFER
You know the goat was a mob vote too right?
Rascal makes mining a bit funnier shich is good but… SNIFFER LETS GOO
we need all the mobs to be added. . we are due for a MOB update. all the losing mobs are all added in one update.. problems are solved..
sniffer 💯💯
i think that the other features will be shown at minecraft live
I WANT SNIFFER!!!!
I feel like the rascal would be the coolest addition. Because it would behave as a minigame, it will be one of the most uniquely interactable mobs outside of villagers. Speaking of which, it will breathe more life into the new-ish massive caves that were introduced to Minecraft. It can also present the opportunity to delve deeper into the lore of ancient cities, as it could potentially be 'from' that biome, and is now wandering the cave systems after being forced out. Also, although they said it will give you an item to help with mining, that doesn't mean it has to ONLY give you such items. Fishing rods, for instance, are supposed to be good for just finding fish, but you can still get miscellaneous items from fishing. Which means it could again give you other items. Finally, said items could also be lore-ish items, such a mineshaft/ancient city treasure map of sorts. Or at the very least, every instance where they have shown that the item helps with mining, the item was shown to be enchanted. If it only spawns around Y = 0, then they likely assume you already have sufficient gear for mining, so the enchantment could very likely be a brand NEW enchantment to help with mining.
But sniffer is nasty as f@ck  Colour pallete, appearance, abilities, the way you get it  It just doesn't fit the game and its lore
What always bothers me about these votes is that we sometimes see all of them actively work in-game... SO WHY CUT SOME OUT IF THEY'RE ALREADY IN THE GAME!?
they got a whole box of mobs already complete they just randomly let 3 out for a vote
I dodnt know Qdandys OC had a part time job!
But the sniffer is a good mob
The problem with the sniffer is that they said the eggs are found in ocean ruins. like it barely does anything other than help you farm 1-2 decorative plants and you have to go on a scavenger hunt to find one. like it's the same a the allay. it's super rare and does nothing for the average player. like at least with the golems you can get like however many you need. I don't mind it if they drop something because then it gives me an immediate incentive to find one. with the sniffer i have to find the egg, then get the seeds, then wait for it to become an adult, then maybe it just lays eggs like a chiken and i don't need 2 to get more of them. I just feel like i'm never gonna see one unless i go on a whole scavenger hunt for the eggs.
I hate how dream rigged the last 2 mob votes
I just feel like the Sniffer makes the most sense with the direction of the game. That doesn't mean I don't want to ever see the others, but since we are being arbitrarily made to lose two of the options...I'll make sure I do my part to save the one I feel best fits in the game.
Get random block that was added in like past 4 major updates and add golem to it and boom a new mob right there
I hope the sniffer will be added
Here are some cool things bout all of the mobs Tuff Golems can be used as employees or for a history museum Sniffers idk Rascals can be good for pro speedrunners!
The sniffer was in my opinion the worse one
The tuff golem just seems like an allay, but completely different
No one has considered that the rascal could be farmable, infinite exp with a grindstone
and why don't they add the 3 mobs?, mojang: *proceeds to sleep*
The glow squid was rigged ;-;
I hope rascal wins becuause very mod voted in so far has had blue on it
The only reason I wanted the Glow Squid in the game was because of the supposed "hypnosis" effect they showed in its video. I was thinking it was going to be a passive version of something like the Mesmer from Subnautica, where instead of hypnotizing you and pulling you in to attack you, it pulls you in and gives a status effect that gives you water breathing or night vision for a small period when you stare at it.
Honestly I think rascal would be a good idea but I will be voting for the sniffer
I have a feeling everyone is voting for the sniffer purely because he would come with new seeds and plants. Which makes sense, but it makes me disappointed because we’re pretty much not even voting for the mob, we’re voting for new features that come with it.
The problem is there getting rid of 2 perfectly good mobs that they spent tying creating because they want some dumb vote when all of these are unique and great mobs :/
Tuff Golem reminds me of Piantas from Super Mario Sunshine.
I just hate how unfair this mob is, I don't even like the sniffer that much and its got 74% of players voting. If you want me to vote for the sniffer, then give me more detail on it, because a new golem would be really nice right now considering how we haven't gotten a new one in over 7 years.
Personally I am not interested in any of the potential mobs and would like to be able to register an anti-vote rather than not vote at all. I don't want something just for the sake of it. I don't see the value of adding a new mob every year that adds little to the game. I would prefer if they cancelled this activity all together and concentrated on the updates
Still sad about the copper golem, loved that thing so much
Vote Sniffer
I think that for once they should just add all 3 mobs. Oh wait, they would say that adding three new mobs and corresponding items at the same time would be too much work for them.
This is the best selling game in the world, how are they keeping this game so barebones, we have to choose 1 out of 3 mobs really?
They give the worse information for them ever and overexaggerate them in the animations or in general really. The votes are also constantly rigged with the opinions of youtubers, yes they can share opinion but then it tells thousands if not, millions of others to vote for what they want too because theyre fav youtuber wants it. Its unfair to the community. And we are told the mobs will be later added, but they have yet to prove that. They should just really leave it down to loser mobs get another chance next year, a 50/50 chance and then the last mob doesnt get added/added wayyy later.
Watch the sniffer only dig up 1 seed every 8 hours
Is the Rascal an Ancient builder
The Sniffer is just so adorable
TUFF GOLEM IS WALKING ITEM FRAME
They’re probably going to expand upon the mob during the Minecraft live event hopefully in accordance with the players expectations about the new mobs
They should just have a update and add them all at once at this point.
Why they cant add them all in anyway?
Why is it a choice at all. Just implement all of them.
I really want to see another golem
I would love to see the voting results but im 85% sure they will not release any concrete data on how the vote concluded, like the precise amount of votes or how many casted their vote. Thou we will likely see the relative percentages.
Rascel seems so much better ;-;
The Sniffer will hopefully add at least two new plants, if not more. This could also be a great way to add an ancient tree as possibly the rarest drop
No 'seeds' doesnt need to mean multiple different seeds, but could also mean multiple of the same seeds or even existing seeds! All we know is that voting the Snifer guarantees a new (only) decorative plant. While the Rascall gives you enchanted iron level loot, which is almost immediately obsolete once you got 3 diamonds. And the Tuff Golem seems like it could be a close contender, but having it walk around all the time may make it undesirable. Content wies voting for the sniffer is the best option. Especially after we got the lackluster glow squid. (We had the chance to get the cool Iceologer, such dissapointing)
I hope next year there will be two different mob votes, a brand new mob vote along with a mob vote consisting of the second-placers from previous years (Iceologer, Copper Golem, and whoever’s second this year). This could promise the return of at least one mob and it will give the community hope for the return of previously lost mobs. Maybe this idea with the last-placers instead.
I disagree. I think it is vitally important that we actually know exactly what the mob does before we vote for it. The Phantom is the proof of that. It is widely regarded as the worst mob in the game. We had an idea of what it would do, but did anyone expect it to be so ungodly annoying? Maybe a few saw that coming, but it wasn't immediately obvious. What if we barely knew anything about the Sniffer, what it if turned out to be another Phantom, and everyone voted for it. We would once again dig our heads into the ground and scream (pun not intended). The reason the Sniffer and Tuff Golem is losing right now is because we have so little to go on. The value of the Rascal is entirely based on an Enchanted Iron Pickaxe, we have NO IDEA what else it will give us. and could just be worthless low grade junk. And the Tuff Golem holds and item and wanders around with it... ok, and this is useful or good in any way because??? No, we need to know what mobs do, since it will impact the game. We only get ONE of them, better pick the best one for the game, and not leave it to a dangerous gamble.
when the glow squid was shown, the animations alluded to it forcing your vision on it, and i thought that would be a fun thing to avoid while fighting mobs, but it turned out to be some glowing signs
there are not going to be bundles because of parity issues
Mojang needs to elaborate on the mobs. Phantom is hated, allay is basically nonexistent, glow squid is also kind of useless. Sniffer is looking to be fun, but relatively useless
I wish they'd just give up on these tiny incremental updates, and instead focus more on making each one a less frequent but more major event. Introduce a new biome or major overhaul per year, each with several new enemies to fight (seriously nobody ever cares about these passive gimmick mobs a few months after they're added,) new blocks and materials to incorporate into our builds, and maybe a new tool and weapon or two.  If Minecraft has any "core gameplay loop" at all, it's exploring, fighting monsters, gathering materials, and building cool stuff. Maybe we could get new pets every once in a while, but even that only really makes sense if they help with one of those three things. *Literally who* ever asked for a golem that occasionally picks up items off the floor?
*must protect the Sniffer at all costs*
Sniffer was best choice by far in my opinion
I want to ride the sniffer
Vote sniffer
It was already said how the tuff golem works. When you place it, it will look for an item, then pick it up and return to the place you placed it in.
I remember when they acted hypnotized by the glow squid in the mob vote, maybe we can do something with that, something similar at least. Perhaps, when you hit a glow squid, you gain nausea, or maybe just if the ink touches you. Idk
I think one of the biggest problems with mob votes is that these mobs don't really add anything huge or anything to the game, so why bother making it a vote, why do we have to choose between 3 miniscule features? obviously people want all of them because alone they are so tiny you will forget about them in a week while modders implement all of these mobs into the game 2 weeks after they were revealed
vote dino!!!!!
What i dislike about the mob votes is that people are very quick to assume mobs do or don't do something, even if mojang tells us exactly what it's going to do and how it's going to work. For example, youtuber ranboo was convincing his viewers to vote for allay, because he said it was going to mine diamonds for him and he will live in a diamond house, even though minecraft developers straight up told us multiple times that it won't be able to do that.
THE SNIFFER SHULD WIN
I just want more plants in the game
Worst mob vote ever
could the sniffer be useless: yes do i still want one: yes
I don't understand why we need to vote at all, the game would be better if they added all 3 of them
why not add all three of them
that's exactly what i've been saying! mojang is AWFUL when it comes to clarity of what a potential mob does. the rascal n the tuff golem have the potential to be absolutely amazing additions to the game, but only if we assume the best. but we can't assume the best, because lack of information ahead of time is precisely why mob votes have been so disappointing in the past; we don't know enough to really be sure we'll like what we're voting for. which is exactly why i think the sniffer is gonna win, my own bias aside. it's simple enough that we don't have to do any guesswork for how it'll actually work or fit into the game, and what we're being deliberately *not* told is part of a surprise. with the other mobs, that lack of information just leaves us wondering if they'll be totally useless beyond their novelty. it's hard to mess up "finds seeds and sometimes they're new seeds" as badly as "wandering trader but worse" or "sometimes picks up an item and holds it"
The mob looks like it comes from mario
The glow squid vote being the 2nd vote.  Meerkat and vulture votes: Am I a joke to you?
I just feel like the rascal is way *too* fictional and bizarre for Minecraft, honest opinion The sniffer is pretty cool and would fit in nice, the baby variant looks pretty cute The tuff golem just exists
All 3 are useless
MOBS DONT NEED TO HAVE A SUPER USEFUL OR EFICIENT USE TO BE COOL! I find it so stupid that some people completely disregard some mobs just because "you cant control it" or "you cant use this". If the mob can provide interesting cenarios for your building or minecraft world in some way, then its a cool mob! Why does the Tuff Golem, for example, has to have some way to be controlled by the player? Why cant it JUST be a cool new golem and a cool status that moves around your base carrying important items?
Tuff golem Winner
Oh wait in the background of the tuff golem thing there's a villager painting and villager sculptures.. Edit: I saw Rascal at 0:36 behind the chairs on the right :O
Nooooo
He got got about the goat being a vote too
снифер
I've always said this. It's always two decoy mobs and then one that's CLEARLY supposed to win.
i love the sniffer's look
We need more iron golem tipes
I still dont get why they cant add them all
I dont understand the people that will choose the first one that is leaked and think that they will ad like 30 new plants
I"m voting for the Rascal because that one sounds like a mob that will help with early mining and may be a fun mob to set up peak a boo farms with.
Basically underpromise and overdeliver.
wait did i just see the rascal drop off a shovel?
or maybe, a mob vote is retarded and they should simply add all 3 mobs into the game instead of upsetting 2/3rds of the playerbase
I have no idea what is going on mojang but they are really not releasing much each update. Like this is just stupid.
I’m going to be quick. Yes, of course it has a problem. The mob vote is plainly dumb for the point on that the game is at this point. All mobs are amazing yet only 1 can live. All of there are cute and could create more live within the game if all the mobs just went in
?????
The sniffers should win
i feel like golems are just useless since thye only move one item? the rascal is usefull but i feel like 2 more new plant a pretty cool and big mob is better

we're back to another *disappointed* update ☝️🤓🤏
I just realised that the sniffer has ears
The rascal seems to also reward enchanted iron shovels but yah it is quite annoying that there so little info per mob like there new seeds/plant and mob then there's just new way to get tools then there a different style of item frame  best one obviously the new seeds/plants or item frame personally seeds my pick but would be nice to know more information like y the golem or rascal would be better like maybe rascal could run to diamonds if they in a range or the golem could have hoppers pull from it or something although that might be to simular to allay
i hate this single votes.  agree that i would vote for sniffer. cz yes more plants more items. which adds.more variety. hopefully.  but it might be just a bush named acient seeds.  second would take tuff golem to add to the game for variety of golems, same way copper golem.  would vote for ally mob but only cz of the feature that is giving. it was way to powerfull not to have item vacum in the game.  i still question bout mobs that are gone. i wonder what we lost getting useless fantoms. wat if we would get far more usefull items that membranes...
After the outro im kind of corious, what would happen if a lightning strikes a sniffer?
But the sniffer brings new plant
If the Tuff Golem and Rascal offered new items, the Sniffer wouldn’t be this popular.
to the people who voted tuff golems; You a real one
I don’t understand why people want the sniffer it adds literally nothing except for a few eggs which we don’t need and a plant
Id really love if the sniffer gave other seeds wich would give us new plants
tuff golem on top
I think mobs that lost previous mob votes should get a second chance.
The Tuff Golem losing just made me hate the Allay even more than before.
The sniffer is my favorite
One big reason why they don't explain mucha bout each mob is because they're all just concepts. Its only an idea and not yet a product. Leaving room for a lot of minor changes and improvements
D
Me who voted for sniffer : ...
vote the sniffer
A big cute weird prehistoric cow thingy is good enough for me, and I'll leave it at that
I like the Glowsquid, I would have also liked to see the yellow cows since we also already have two forms of muushrooms. And I would have wanted the copper golem with its new copper items way more than the allay. It's been a good while since 1.18/9 never bothered to go find an allay.
Sniffer is so cute! I NEED IT IN MY MINECRAFT WORLD
What I like most is how the presented the mobs. Golem: holds stuff and walks around. Can wear lama gowns Rascal: find it 3 times in a mineshaft under y=0 (or something like that) and get something possibly bad. Sniffer: An ancient mob which loves fauna, they're specialized in digging seeds. Relocate and spread these creatures and maybe you'll get a whole new set of designer plants and blocks. Waw
i just like the idea of a giant beast roaming in someone's farm
LOL😂
I want the Sniffer because y'all let the Moobloom die
man when I voted for glow squid I was hoping they give us a feature to paint but I guess making pixel art on using map will have to do for now
2:58 wasn’t the second community mob vote between foxes, vultures and frogs?
What what about all three of them they'll be a lot more easy to add all three of them yeah that all three of them that would be more easier they add all three of them at the same time all three of them in Minecraft at the same time all three all three of them but they work on one at a time they will work on one at a time they would they need to do work I want to put the program put the programming together that all three of them in the same time and make sure the code of Minecraft is right to put them into
I cant belive how stupid peaple are thinking the tuff golem is the copper golem its just a worse allay it dosnt drop items it only steals them and turns into a statue thats it it will do nothing whit red stone
I've kind of just realized, I don't think I've ever used phantom membrane to repair my elytra. By the time I've got an elytra, I usually have a mending and unbreaking book prepared for it already.
on a side note i cant imagine saying 20 in a minecraft version.
fun fact the panada is a mob vote winner the mob vote was in china so no western audience would see it
the problem is that there useless, all of the mobs people vote for are useless. the best use we have in any mob is the rascal, and people clearly dont want him in the game, they want the big dino that gives plants. so in other words, vote rascal
History repeats
Awesome Animation! May I use the model?
It’s kinda annoying how: 1. They usually make only one mob seem interesting/useful. 2. Everyone decides immediately 3. We seem to not get the full picture, but it’s always that the mob is completely useless
Sniffer
Honestly, it seems like they wanted the sniffer to win and just threw in some spacers. Like the other ones couldve been awesome! Like the tuff golem could be tameable or helps people kill mobs, but no. Its a walking itemframe. And the sniffer comes with a new plant and awesome lore, looks adorable and actually have a use. Its like its not even a mob vote because we all know its gonna win even though the vote hasn’t begun.
I'm voting the stuff golem
Another note is that a minecraft dev has confirmed that the seeds that come with the  sniffer are purely aesthetic and will serve no purpose other than looking good. I have no problem with that but a lot of people think that the plants might give crops or grant you effects like like swiftness when eaten. But that’s just wrong. Mojang has to be clearer when presenting the mobs.
I don't get why people want new seeds rather than a boost in the early game and more accessible enchants
They gave sniffer so much more detail compared to the other ones... I feel like they wanted sniffer to win.
I HATE the stupid ears on the Sniffer
In this year the fan base wanted to make their minds before anything
Sniffer is cool I guess but anyone with a moderate farm knows once you have a few seeds you inevitably have too many.
I. Want. More. Hostile. MOBS.
mojang already knows what mob will win, they are obviously trying to make the sniffer win the same as they have done with the allay. The vote is just for marketing. They know that the children will love a tiny angel and a cute dinosaur that you say wil add more things to the game even when they add plants without the mobs coming with it
Did somebody notice in the ''close cased''(the last mob vote video) that the Rascal gives the player an iron shovel? That confirms that the Rascal doesn't only give pickaxes as reward for finding it for 3 times.
I’m so annoyed that Majon keep adding useless mobs there’s absolutely no purpose for the tough Gollum the copper golem was such a better mob😢
It won't be an archeology update
Nah, Mojang is quite lazy and low cost for the funding they have
Rascal
Honestly when i saw the sniffer getting a plant as well i thought all the others will also get a new item, i was wrong and now everyone is picking the sniffer bc we getting more stuff, like the egg, new plant and the mob and idk if you count the big one as well, so basically 3 new things and if you count the big one is 4, kinda cool  But the tuff golem doesn't do anything useful its just for decorative by moving your item around so no purpose but cool for builds  The rascal also a cool concept but we don't know if it's gonna be useful if it just gives you a reward that we don't know how, i was thinking maybe it could also get a new item that we don't have maybe a gadget to make the player better? Or a new type of tool/ weapon that u can't craft (not to OP tho) , jep did say on twitter it does give you other rewards as well and not just an iron pickaxe but we don't know what that is, i think the rascal could be useful for early game but late game not so much, i was also thinking what if you keep a rascal in a small box and just stare at it all the time, can you make a small farm out of that?   Anyways thats my idea, so I'm 100% voting for the sniffer and i do agree there is a problem with mob voting, the information is not clear
it has a egg form also (sniffer)
For some reason everyone assumes the Rascal is only going to give you a pickaxe. That's very unlikely. It's probably gonna be a random loot. These votes don't work because people are quick to assume wrong. They also said that every mob will feature new content. But people seem to believe only the Sniffer will bring new stuff (plants).
The reason the allay I heard was voted because people thought they could infinitely dupe items
VOTE FOR THE SNIFFER OR VANISH
I think the biggest problem this time is that the other two mobs don't have addition things . As you can see, new seeds will appear with sniffer. But others don't .  For Rascal I think it is really pity. I think it will be better if we can trade with him and get some scarce items . For Tuff golem... uh to me I will like the golem that can help me battle. Just taking  things is too boring to me.
This is genuinely one of the worst videos on the platform. Clickbaity and pointless. You should be ashamed
i think, we could decorate the tuff golems with the shards, witch we can decorate pots. When the next update is going to be the archeology update
People don’t realise that the rascal doesn’t just drop a pic, In the last video where we see all of the mobs the rascal drops an enchanted iron shovel.  Dont mean to be byist but vote sniffer
Stop early showing the mob folds creatures you wouldn’t be surprised
Sniffer
I have a theory, that the mob votes are always rigged by giving one mob absolutely every reason to be in the game but letting the other 2 just blend in, yiu have to lool really close to realize like oh they are special  The tuff golem: walking item frame The rascal: hide and seek The sniffer: ill sniff thw ground to recover                         seeds so you can have even more                    and diverse plants  Allay: give me an item and ill bring multiple           of that item to you if they are nearby Copper golem: chicken on presure plate "Moss creature": ill light up very dark places  Moobloom: another cow Ice-olliger: ice mage Glow squid: glowing squid that youll find in                     water that can make a glowing                      item frame  The only mob vote that had a fair chance for all the mobs in the vote, you had the phatom, the great hunger, a king blaze, and a large squid-like-kraken  The mobs that win always add a block to the game or even multiple besides the allay and phantom, i want to hear your ideas about this in this comments replies
just wish they could add all the mobs instead off one but fair i guess. Just feel like the sniffer is just gonna be that other mob that is gonna be underused everyone will fall in love with it as soon as it releases and just forgotten in the sea. I have a feeling the Allay has already become that way. But I like the Allay and Sniffer for Lore purpose. But the Rascal could also be a good lore secret. But that is just my opinion.
I'm so glad the sniffer is winning!
I wish the rascal would basically ask for a fee to play like a diamond pickaxe and then if you find them it give you enchantments based on how fast you found them.
find me pork truffles and I'll give you golden carrots
what if the Sniffer would give us (speculation) new types of seeds for farms like maybe apple seeds, carrot seeds or maybe even potato seeds to makes these kind of foods easier to find
Why did you show the animations of the mobs. It’s entirely superfluous and I do think it’s copyright infringement or at the very least free booting. You are a sham
I also just saw those in game animations I would love to see them implement models and show them off in game.   Like I love the 8bit trailers but I would love if they would show off more of the in game model and other features it brings.
while the rascal seems fun at first, i feel like it’d quickly turn into a nuisance later on and the golem is basically just something to look at so probably gonna go with the sniffer since it’s the only one to offer new items (also a baby variant)
Rascal: Imagine you’re in a mine and your tools are about to die but then you spot them 3 times and get new ones Sniffer: Seeds and lore Tuff Golem: Imagine trying to go across the world but your inventory is full, this guy could help you take things across the world  Edit: The Tuff Golem might also add a hat
As one person said the losers haven’t been implemented yet.  My biggest issue is how we never got a second place mon vote from the previous years votes.   Also how hard would it be to belike we are adding all the last three second place winners.
5:45 i just realised in down left corner, the door are in the middle
Mojang almost definitely knew the sniffer would win because it helps an archeology update
This is why I love the Minecraft community.
Someone tell minecraft for their last and final update ever, they should add all the mobs in the mob vote that lost, all biome updates that lost, and biomes that lost. AND ADD BACK FIRE FLYS! JUST DONT MAKE THE FROG EAT THEM! SIMPLE! IM TALKING TO U MOJANG
I never knew that alley fact

i've gotten tired of the mob votes, I kinda want them to add all 3
Tuff golem has no use.
my biggest issue with the mob votes is that they even happen in the first place. mojang is perfectly capable of implementing all of the mobs showcased in each mob vote, and has even fleshed out each choice to the point of having a design and function for each of the mobs, only for 1/3rd or less of that work to actually make it into the game proper.
194 in the comments
I'm glad allay won I voted on it.
Stupid dream got the glow squid to win
I actually want a biome vote next year.
Omgosh how many times have the devs said the rascal gives more then just a pickaxe
I genuinely think this Sniffer- farmed infinite times for seeds Rascal- farmed infinite times for pickaxes Tuff golem- Duplication glitch
I find all of the three mobs quite cute! I know my comment will most likely be drowned within the others here with reasoning over this all, but oh well—I still think I should comment my common opinion.
I'm on team rascal
My problem with the sniffer is you won't even find them around the map  So there is no "wow look at this beautiful scenery" no it's just find egg get seed alright bye bye  Copper golem coulda been a nice design like sentries posted outside a door. Or a random BUTTON redstone randomizer. And a use for copper and lightning rods  Tuff golem could have been a servant like thing walking around the expanse of your base filling the air. And imagine if your base is an abandoned temple Tuff golem would make the atmosphere work.  But I may have to only dream
I really like the idea of the Rascal! I know it is the least populous one because the sniffer adds to the lore but just think of how it can help with gameplay? Have you ever gotten stuck while mining because your pickaxe broke? Well fear no longer just go to a mineshaft that you found and find a Rascal, when you find it just three times you will get a pickaxe and be able to go back to the surface! This will also help if you don’t play on peaceful, you get stuck and have run out of food! You will still be able to live since you got a new pickaxe to help you!
I honestly just hate choosing between all those. I want mob votes to just influence what comes first, and the losers following up afterwards quickly. Mods that re-add mobs from votes are a godsend
The problem with your idea is that people might vote for a mob based on speculation and not fact leading to them being disappointed if the mob doesn't turn out to be what they were expecting
I liked the phantom because there wasn't information Mojang was putting out that was inaccurate. The trailers on the other hand have always included one or two quarks that make it hard to tell if it is a planned feature, or just a characterization of the animation. Are there going to be varients of the sniffer? Im willing to bet no because it was so off handed despite a large one being mentioned and shown. They would likely make a point about ancient animals being bigger, but they eventually evolved in to smaller forms, like the Giant Sloth or Crocodiles. I also doubt the hatching animation is going to be a thing considering all other egg based mobs still just "appear" when hatched.  It would just be to easy to take every word they give on what to expect, so almost everything becomes questionable. Maybe this one will be different, who knows.
Es pañolllllllll
Phantom membrane is still nice for the end fight with the slow falling potions
Next Mob vote they have to Bring The Second most Voted Mobs from the Previous Mob Votes Cause I'll be honest The Glow Squid one was Rigged
Is not tamable 😭😭
Moment of silence for them still not adding squirls
Just add all three. Boom, everyone happy.
what if we just all put the votes into a number generator from 1-3 and vote the number thats picked, that way the votes will all have very similar numbers, mojang wouldnt want to dissapoint 66% of their community so they could add all 3
mob vote simplified: Tuff golem: glorified item display Rascal: little peek' a' boo boi Sniffer:UNLIMITED SEEEEEEEEEEEDS
Who else thought that the glow squid would hypnotize players
I imagine the reality of the Rascal is that he just gives you an enchanted wooden pickaxe with unbreaking 1 or something
I would say the rascal should have more votes since it rewards u smth whenever u spot him 3 times. Plus he looks like a good mop for a hide and seek map
This is the only time we can get a dinosaur in Minecraft vote (SNIFFER) Minecraft players vote with me. SNIFFER 4 LIFE
The problem I see is that the Sniffer is far more fleshed out as a design. It's cute, has a cycle of hatching from a unique egg and growing up, and comes with the promise of multiple new plants.  The other two's appeal comes from gameplay mechanic *potential*, where they might be interesting if they do more than what the videos show, but would be bland if what we see is what we get like in the previous votes. The Rascal and Tuff Golem don't have the cuteness or new items that the Sniffer has, which doesn't just give the Sniffer an advantage; It makes the Sniffer the *objective* best choice.  On top of the what you see is all you get problem, there's the problem of lack of balance between the contestants. Really, all three mobs in a vote should offer new items. All three options should be so good that you're stressing not over which one you want, but which two you can bring yourself to live without! I feel like the biome votes did this the best; Each option came with a new biome, a new mob, and a new item or two.
People are really only choosing sniffer because its cute, but no one is really considering how useless the plants could end up being. After you get your plants you wont have a use for the mob anymore. It's going to get stale very fast.   Tuff golems are highly underrated for how customizable they are and how they will almost always be relevant towards any build you make. Store clerks, resturant waiters and chefs, villager assistants, factory worker, potion seller, etc. Theres plenty of things you can do with a mob that can hold stuff and change colors to match the aesthetic. You have full control of where it spawns (and where it sleeps as a result), its cheap to build.... its a golem.  People need to think more creatively in the long term. Lore isn't something you can play with, the sniffer will basically have the A.I. of a sheep periodically munching dirt dropping seed, seeds that may not give that useful of a plant. Is a turtle sheep really going to be that interesting long term? Dont you think that at some point your inventory will have too many seeds? At the end of the day its just gonna wander your base randomly filling it with seeds. If you're gonna have something wander around randomly, why not at least have something that wont leave a mess on the floor (rather does the opposite picking up stuff) and look cool (in 17 styles) carrying stuff either role playing or showing off your rare stuff?  If people still cant see the tuff golems potential, you just aren't very creative.    Oh and rascal is dead on arrival, the loot is just too useless to be worth it, and likely despawns like a wandering trader so it wont even be a companion despite what it adds to mineshafts. I hate mob votes, we lose so much good stuff and basically have to rely on mods to do the hard work that mojang refuses to do.
This is like gargalon
the sniffer is boring. I want the rascall
Well…. I’m still voting for sniffer no matter what anyone says
1 modpacks give you so many things whatever you want get fulfilled . They just adding trash updates.  These days every single person have atleast 2-3 mods installed. I don't think no one play vannila except YouTubers.  Nothing exciting. 1.18 with mods alone is amazing.
Another problem the past two was it was seemingly decided by twitter polls that were way too short lasting. It wasn't even a community thing in that sense. ANYONE could vote to rig it. Someone who doesn't even play minecraft could probably make a bunch of bots to vote on a choice and ruin it for everyone. If you had to login to the offical site to prove you even owned minecraft in the first place, this would prevent most forms of birgading. Less non-players voting to appease their Content creator god and more actual player votes mattering.
my best friend would rather have a tuff golem that wanders around with random items you threw on the floor instead of the sniffer that makes farming alot more easier and also give more crops AND the rascal that gives free enchanted tools if you find it 3 times   i mean its his oppinion but atleast vote for a actual mob that helps you in the game
youtubers
i just hope hats and overall the whole archeology thing will be added
I feel Mob Votes would be a lot cooler if all the mobs were added into the game, but the winning mob would have the highest priority, and be added in the coming update with all its features. Then the second most voted mob would be added in the next update after that, and the final third mob would be added in the following update after that. I just feel that a lot of the mobs that were in these votes have a lot of potential to be in the game, and Mojang just throws these good ideas away, wasting their creativity. I mean, The Hovering Inferno could've been great for 1.16, but since it lost the last vote, it got thrown away, and the Iceologer could've been a great addition for the big mountains of 1.18 if it hadn't lost to the Glowsquid, just to name a few. Anyhow, great video overall, and I can't wait to see more!!!
'But what actually is the Sniffer? Everyone keeps saying it's a dinosaur but it has six legs not four... And also we have no solid proof if it is going to like to Archaeology update (If that's ever going to be added). Also the name "Sniffer" along with the others just sound very bland and boring... And their mechanics to the game are sort of too. I know it is adding stuff to the game but do we actually need these ones?' - Chrome
Minecraft votes are sad and broken, they should have just posted names or just a pictures of the mob, blind voting is the most fair vote system for minecraft.
i think the Sniffer got an unfair advantage by being the only mob where they hinted that it would add more features than just the mob itself. most players will now pick it just because they know they’ll essentially get more than they vote for, and the other two don’t seem nearly as enticing by comparison ((especially since they didn’t indicate what type of prizes the Rascal gives besides an iron pick))
pretty sure they just made 2 undesirable mobs and 1 very good one so theres an obvious winner that the whole community likes and thus no real backlash or drama about it

rascal sounds like a cool idea but i feel like in practice it will end horribly as no way that won't be buggy (oh and if it's just gonna give like efficiency 2 iron pickaxes.. yeah..) tuff golem... moving item frame, i guess? and the sniffer finds seeds and new plants. this doesn't feel like a fair competition..
One of the big problems isn’t just how little information they released on the mobs, but how the information they do realease isn’t accessible or no one talks about it.  A good example of this is how the rascal doesn’t just give you an enchanted pickaxe, but everyone assumes it does because few saw the post about it.
tuff golem will win
Ivote rascal
As a builder i prefer the sniffer   Its would give more flower to make garden or maybe put them in pot to make new ways of decoration  The rascal isnt really interesting and wpuld probably be glitch again with a rascal automated farm that wpuld generate loot like crazy   And finally the tuff golem  Which is ABSOLUTLY Useless for me  Its a moving item frame ? What the goal about that :x i dont see any use of it
I just know that Dream will ruin it. Hopefully he goes for the Sniffer.
One thing I find to be a shame is the overall lack of implementation to the losing votes. Mojang stated the losing options wouldn't be gone but added later down the line. We really haven't seen any of these return except for frogs and boats with chests.
You nail the problem on the head. None of these mobs have much in the way of sandboxy complexity behind them, which feels understandably weird in a sandbox focussed game like Minecraft. I have no idea what the design philosophies are over at Mojang, but the devs seem to have somehow lost the ability to make more mobs with even just as wide a range of uses as simple pigs have. Like nothing over the past view full release versions has managed to not just have a basic function, but a secondary use and a whacky, secret mechanic, which for pigs are breeding and dropping meat, being a moderately fast mount without requiring movement keys and the fact, that they turn into zombie piglins when struck by lightning, respectively. And like you say, the community already comes up with interesting ways to give these proposed mobs extra features, so it's not like we just don't have the necessary creativity available to flesh them out beyond their base function at all.
tuff golem
Making the choice based on a vote is in my opinion not great. It’s fun for the community but the outcome is often disappointing. Especially since most mobs that lose are either postponed for years later, or never implemented and forgotten. Plus if Dream in the last mob vote is anything to learn through, it’s that people with fame will always sway votes unfairly.
The rascals just scary
Wait. Wait. Wait.  U missed 2 mob votes (i mean i suppose they were biomes but same thing) when saying all the previous ones: goat frog vulture and fox meerkat ostrich
Mmm ganna pick sniffer
I would love a mobe where you vote  previous losers to rejoin if they win this new form of mob vote
Honestly, all of the mobs are kind of trash.
How would y'all feel if they add allowable sword effect like using the potion? Like because why would we make a poison drinkable potion then a throwing poison drinking potion and have a risk of hitting our self with it like it stupid instead we can apply it to our weapon or hoe for poisoned food or something and apply the effect to the person we hit
No matter how cool the sniffer is the winning mob vote is definitely what dream wants especially now that he did a face reaveal
Sniffers are cute change my mind
100
This is probably the weakest mob vote yet. Would love the sniffer or the tuff golem in game.
Imagine if the sniffer wins and the eggs can’t be found in the ocean or not anywhere it’s an extinct mob that you can only spawn in its spawn egg and does nothing
My issue with mob votes is that the losers are supposedly never going to get a chance to get in the game. Like the iceologer and copper golem would have been great additions.
As much as I hate when game companies do stuff like announce something with little to no information, watch everyone else brainstorm cool ideas and then take them (it doesn't happen much, but when it does its just annoying) I do wish Mojang would be a little more receptive to the communities feedback on the actual implementation and function of some of the newer mobs. People had such amazing ideas for the items the glow squid was going to drop when that was first announced, but they just ignored it entirely.
NEW THING FOR THE TUFF GOLEM: might add a new carpet since it doesn’t match up with any other carpet
I wish sometime they do 2 mobs win and 1 lose that will be nice
Should just add them all
I bet The Sniffer voting incident will happen.
The problem is that the mobs are completely useless compaired to the other mobs. The fact that we get virtuaöly no information about the mobs is stupid. I would prefer if they removed the allay, phantom and glow squid because rhey add so little to the game/ make the game worse. Minecraft has plenty of mobs and the mobs have to be alot better for it to be worthwile.
Rascal can be used to make a iron pic farm
I still really hate the phantom.

Is it just me that noticed the wierd plants on the beach in the sniffer teaser?
The main issue is that there's usually an obvious and more interesting choice, but the votes were swayed by infuencers and youtubers to get the thing that's better in a thumbnail than better for the game. I have a feeling we're gonna have that same sort of thing happen again here since the mobs got revealed quite a bit before the vote.
I think we need to demand Minecraft to give s more specific and concrete information about a Mob, and not just speak down to us like we are kids. Also there are too many kids voting, we need more people voting over the age of 10.
No, but I am
The mob votes are just a way to make social media storms and to divide the community to promote the game.
Hit the nail on the head with this one, Stormfrenzy! I always assume there will be more mechanics to these mobs than there end up being. The votes are definitely a way gain interest in the event but I agree that many times these new mobs don't add enough to the game-play and I would prefer to not have a new mob every update unless it's something that the game designers have really planned and thought out.
It might just be the art style but I think all three of this years mobs look too moded and to be honest, ugly. The only one that doesn’t look ugly is the tuff golem. I feel like a lot of stuff they have added over the last few years has seemed too moded and Minecraft is kind of losing that simple charm that it used to have.
Sniffer all the way~
Why don’t they add them all?
Hey, thanks so much stormfrenzy! Oh, and good video too! 😃
I really want the golem to win we need a new one the ones we have are getting boring
what will the rascal do when you have full diamond , the tuff golem just randomly move, so the sniffer is the best here
Average rascal fan
In a few days dream will vote for the rascal so he can get clutch tools for his manhunts 😒 and we will get a trash mob again just like the glowsquid
They should use the system of voting, where when voting you assign a 1, 2, or 3 (in this case) and weigh who wins based on not only what the community wants most, but by what they'll be the least upset about.
Why do so many people want golems sniffer is better😊
Mfs really voted for the glow squid in 2020 while there was a iceologer, which is way more interesting and cooler.
Then all of sudden DREAM VOTES FOR RASCAL
TUFF GOLEM
sniffer is just so cool he cant loose!
i just relliized something the sniifer has hands
*sniff sniff* i hear the sniffer winning the vote
so true, well done
The problem is they do not give us enough information. People will give their own ideas to the mob being added and then be disappointed when what they wanted wasn't added because Mojang has not thought out the mobs and are not giving us enough information. Everyone thought the allay would be so great for the game but when it was actually added yeah it was cute but it really doesn't have a purpose. I don't know anyone who genuinely uses an allay on a regular basis
I'm calling fraud if the Sniffer won't be the winner...
Some1 is just gonna make an add on adding all of them so idrc what wins
from now on we will never listen to some youtuber tell us what to vote
Technically, the Glow Squid never won in my opinion. Dream used his massive fanbase to rig the Mob Vote.
Does the Minecraft mob vote have a problem?   Is water wet?
I was gonna make some three films about these mobs but this might have to wait awhile :/
the mob votes is just a way to gather the community around a cool event
Mob votes in general cause literal wars almost every time tbh
Nice
