Two nothing teams in a nothing competition in front of nothing people
The only game this season scott Wright preformed
Ryan Jack is a legend
That’s Cackled what’s was he thinking about? He could’ve broken his legs.
Shagger ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rangers and Hamburg
I took at look at the 90th minute and thought Rangers were gonna bottle it. only now do I find out they won :o
I'm looking forward to an old firm final it's been a while now since we last had one. From a Celtic perspective let's hope if the referee and var don't get who's in goal for "The" Rangers mixed up and a serious Glasgow Celtic turn up then it's one down two to go...
As much as I like McGregor, he don’t strike fear into the strikers anymore. I get Davies and barasic should do better for the goal but McGregor should be making that ball his, no pace on the ball and right in front of him. I think that’s what Davies is expecting. Any keeper claims that.
African Players Ranger hahaha
Hun zombie rats yir clubs deed ibroaks haha
Another old firm derby final.. gonna be another brawl math once again..
The waffle house has found its new host

Much love from Amsterdam 🧡
consider yourself to be a good person? Most people do. However, most of us differ as to the definition of “good.” The Bible says that God is good, and the Ten Commandments are His standard of goodness. So, we will look at God’s Law . . . With a tender conscience, ask yourself if you have obeyed the following: 1. You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?) 2. You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you’re more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?) 3. You shall not take God’s name in vain. (Have you ever used God’s holy Name as a cuss word?) 4. Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy. 5. Honor your father and mother. 6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder). 7. You shall not commit adultery. (“Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart” Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage). 8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant). 9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions). 10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealously desired what belongs to others?) The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts. On Judgment Day, will you be found to be guilty or innocent of breaking His commandments? Perhaps you think that God is good, and will therefore overlook your sins. But it is His goodness that will make sure that murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, etc. receive justice. He would be a corrupt Judge if He turned a blind eye to injustice. Have you kept the Commandments? The Bible says that the Law is perfect. It commands you to be perfect (Matthew 5:48). Are you perfect (in thought, word, and deed)? Will you make it to Heaven? You may say that you are still good, but God says you’re not (see Psalm 14:2-3). So one of you is lying, and the Scriptures tell us that it is impossible for God to lie. Remember that all liars will be cast into the Lake of Fire (Revelation 21:8). God’s Law demands justice, and the penalty for sinning against Him is death and Hell. Listen carefully if you want to live. God Himself made a way where His justice and His goodness could meet. We broke the Law, but He became a man to pay the fine. Jesus suffered and died on the cross to satisfy the Law. Then He rose from the dead, defeating death forever. Therefore God can forgive us and grant us the gift of everlasting life! But you may still think that you can (from now on) keep the Ten Commandments. But isn’t it true that the best of us have lied, stolen, lusted, hated, failed to love God above all else, and failed to love our neighbor as ourselves? How can we then, live a “good” life if we have already sinned against God? At best we are reformed liars and thieves . . . but still Lawbreakers. Think of it this way – would you sell one of your eyes for a million dollars? Would you sell both for $50 million? I’m sure you wouldn’t. Your eyes are priceless, yet they are merely the windows of your soul. What then must your life (soul) be worth? With these thoughts in mind, what would be a fair price to pay for everlasting life? It is utterly without price. Yet, if we trust in our own goodness to enter Heaven, we are saying to God, “I should enter Heaven because I have done good – I have earned my way in.” Imagine if you wanted to give me a brand new (very expensive) car, but I said, “I can’t take it! I feel embarrassed receiving such a gift . . . here’s 10 cents for it.” I’m sure you would be very insulted by such a pathetic offer of payment. Besides, if I pay for it, it is no longer a gift, it’s a purchase . . . it’s mine by right. When we talk of entering Heaven by being good, by trying to keep the Ten Commandments etc., we are tossing God 10 cents of “self-righteousness,” which is a terrible insult to Him, in the light of His sacrifice. The only thing we can do is humble ourselves, repent of our sins, and receive the gift by trusting Jesus Christ alone. Almighty God demonstrated how much He loves you when Jesus suffered for you on the cross. If you want to trust in your own goodness, then you are saying His agonizing death on the cross was in vain. The Bible says, “For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.” You cannot earn a gift. When Jesus said to “believe” on Him, He was saying we should have faith in Him, in the same way you would trust a parachute to save you when you jump from a plane. You don’t merely believe in the parachute – you put it on. Please don’t “jump” without Jesus. If you die in your sins there is no second chance. God will give you justice, and you will end up in Hell forever. Any troubles you have at present are dwarfed by the trouble you are in with your Creator. His wrath abides upon you (John 3:36). God doesn’t want you to go to Hell. Neither do you want to go there, so confess your sins to God right now, put your trust in Jesus to save you, and you will pass from death to life. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. (See John 14:21). Your obedience to God is the proof of your love. Have faith in God, He will never fail you. Pray something like this: “Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is ‘The way, the truth, and the life.'” Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus’ name I pray. Amen.”
The Famous do it again !   Well done, Rangers !
Wow just found out Scotland has it’s own little league, that’s soooo cute 😊
Beautiful challenge football has went soft 😅
Who edited these highlights absolutely brutal job
U
Go on the Gers
Wish I'd of put money on Rangers and Celtic way back in 1984, I would be a multi millionaire now...
It's the most boring league in the world we know who's going to win everything every year ethier rangers or celtic all the other teams are crap  ,what predictable and boring league 😴
Now we up against celtic whose fans seem to be more obsessed with watching us to find stuff to complain about. Should be a tasty game next month.
On the tackle I think it was a red but I think he was unlucky, it was the turn back inside that got him,he was already commited to the player going done the line.i think he would still have been booked if the rangers man went straight but not a red.
Sakala already slipped the ball through Stewart and got punished - no doubt red card . Better pitch it would have been about 5-2
It would be good if teams like,Aberdeen, Hibs, Motherwell, all put in performances  against Celtic like they do against Rangers maybe then it would be a better League to play in.
What a cracking game that was...well done rangers on getting to the final, fair play to Jim and his team anaw for having a go and making it a right good watch.
Shocking challenge. Red card all day long.
Gone the bears 💪
Hanging on with a thread every game, celtic will sort yous out soon enough 💪🏼🍀
The self-owning irony of the most upvoted comment on most Rangers videos being about 'obsessed' Sellik fans 🤣
Typical Aberdeen always up for giving Rangers a game but had they won  and got to the final you could guarantee they would have rolled over against Celtic, if I was a dons fan I’d be starting to question this blinkered mentality.!!!
Love Ryan jack
See the VAR boys done their team a favour again by not checking the swipe by Kent on Scales, another one to add to the list😂🤦‍♂️ I’m sure they’ll even out some day 🤔
The Tribute act score and there first song is all aboot Fenian blood🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. Zombie rodents
What a shame, Aberdeen didn't deserve to lose to this lot.
Ghastly, career-stopping tackle. No wonder it was a red.
Brilliant from Stoke City fan 👏 💙🇬🇧❤️
McGregor's done, tav and barasic are useless, but saying that so are the mint sauce brigade so it was always gonna be close, best team won in the end but new personnel needed at Ibrox.
That Irish commentator......So fkn negative about everything.  Does my head in.
What is wrong with McGregor in that Aberdeen goal that was dissalowed ?   Never seen a goalkeeper actually not bother to even raise his hands to try and save a shot from going in.
Coventry/Rangers loyal
I'd like to see a video of the low-lights. Or you could just call it Barisic and Tillman cam.
Welldone referee......  Send off Aberdeen player on the 93rd minute when its 1-1 but you only give Morelos a yellow for that atrocious take down in the box and numerous other Rangers hacking take downs.   Aberdeens first goal was onside and denied to.   No 5min VAR interruptions either.   See you masonic cheating bast@rds in Hampden next month and dont forget to bring your VAR and your masonic referees with you Rangers 2.0  You're going to need all the help your team can get.   😂😂😂
What a game. Proper intensity to it. Bring on the final. Should be a cracker. Hope it's a night time kick off.
One of the best semi finals I’ve seen, fair play to Aberdeen they made it hard but it’s all about the famous
Creegs = fanny
That tackle is a red card all day long
Jonny hayes was so unlucky. Aberdeen played really well. Stupid decision by Anthony Stewart cost Aberdeen the match! On to darvel ❤
As a Celtic fan I seen alot of Celtic fans complaining about certain decisions in this game but that tackle is a red card all day Rangers were just the better team but Aberdeen made it a really good game.
Hello! Hello! We are the Billy Boys!
👁🥶👁safe and effective 💔👀
Hee heee he 👍👌🇬🇧
We are the People
Good Scottish names there ha ha
Incredible, who would have thought it, a Rangers v Celtic final. Wish I put a tenner on it, would have won 50p.
Wait until 26th  We are only obsessed with our own club .you lot are a joke
i see celtic are allready bagging the final as winners iam not so sure about that claim iam a torquay fan and i can tell you rangers have had a much tougher route to the final than celtic my money will be going on the boys from ibrox for sure
Best semi final in Scotland in years…Better team won…
I reckon it'll be 2 each in the Final.  Two for Alfie and two for Sakala.   🤣🤣🤣  Rule Britannia !
Don’t need any favours from your shit team gobshite🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
That was an awful tackle (assault) by Stewart. Brainless. Hopefully he isn't captain going ahead. Shinnie should get it.
Where does Morelos buy his pies from. Need to avoid that baker as the choice will be limited.
Why can Kent assault one of our players without punishment and Stewart gets sent off for a late challenge on an opponent? It’s unjust isn’t it SFA? Just like the Kilmarnock boy being assaulted yesterday and not getting a penalty against the other Cheek. It’s rigged, clearly! Disgraceful!
We’ll give the Tim’s a goal of a start in the final and beat them too 😁👍
2 points;  why is a national semi final not available on a Chanel we can ALL watch; our national stadium pitch is an absolute disgrace.
No sign of Kent's punch to the back of Scales head? Typical, should have seen red and levelled things up at 10 v 10.
The pitch today helped the sheep from Aberdeen.   Silly little club, just like Celtc.
Dirty sheep shaagan cnts
Didn't play badly at all apart from dropping deep just before equaliser. Had enough of Stewart now tho. Regardless the colour of card it's a stupid reckless challenge in an area where we were in no danger whatsoever. Finished off any hope we had. Gutted. Probably won't get a better chance than that cos they are no great shakes. That's twice recently we have let them off the hook. However the effort can't be faulted. We left nothing out there.
Stewart cost us today. Shame, as he had been playing really well up until that terrible tackle on Sakala. Rangers looked pretty bang average, and even after we went down to 10 men, we still took the game to Rangers.  Work in progress for Goodwin, hopefully another few transfer windows and we’ll have a good side. Celtic will take Rangers apart in the final.  Also, whilst at the game, the entire Rangers support around the stadium singing several times the Billy Boys, “up to our knees in fenian blood surrender or you’ll die”.  These “fans” simply cannot help themselves when it comes to descending into sectarian behaviour and the fact that the SFA repeatedly turn a blind eye to this is a disgrace.  Time to dock points in league games and throw them out of the cup competitions…then liquidate them!
Keep it positive..great match..the don't did their best but quality will always win out eventually. No fear..we will go unbeaten , the same as our Invincibles season to stop 10 IAR. WATP 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
What a captain, getting sent off, take the armband off that idiot, I follow the dons as my son and grandson lives only 15 miles from their ground , and they go to every home game. Oh, and I live in Essex, 600 odd miles away
Think the them behind the microphone was rooting for rangers all the way and the refs should be from out side the Glasgow area
I hate Ryan Jack and Scott Wright, they were nothing before us. Also wtf was Stewart thinking
Everyone loves Rangers !  The most famous Scottish club.  Rule Britannia !
Such a game
Rangers will get walloped against Celtic ☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️Well done Aberdeen , a man sent off and a goal disallowed, sounds familiar?
never a red card ian beale getting bailed out by the wee mason walsh once again …that  commentator is the most biased cunt ive ever heard bet he sits with a rangers top on dreaming of being pegged by beale
Wow. Some match this. Hampden looks more like Murrayfield.
Everyone loves Rangers !    The most famous Scottish club.   Rule Britannia !
Good to see off the sheep, now for "them" in the final . . . . . .
Why does Jack kiss the badge in these games and wonder why he can’t have a night out in aberdeen city centre?🤦‍♂️
Have to be more clinical
Line up to be slaughtered 🐑
Ranger V Celtic in final! What a shock! Barca v Madrid in Spanish Super Cup final, another huge Shock! Wats the point of these two leagues! 🤣🤣

excellent result but we still look dodgey at the back and fortunate to get the win .
Stewart's tackle looks more brutal every time you watch it.
Alll that ti get to the final and get spanked from Celtic 😂😂
I'm sure Aberdeen hit the post in the second half?
the pitch is disgusting
Bring on that mhanky mob! 👍🇬🇧

Big well done to Aberdeen for making it to their cup final.   Glasgow Rangers🎉
Aberdeen just not at their best today ..Rangers endeavour got them through with their best performance of the season but as 'good' as they were , they were still totally dugshit in the grand scheme of things
Get it up yous ya sheep shagging horrible bastards
The glorious loyal rangers ..cmon from loyal Aston villa,,
The best team in Scotland win again.  Rule Britannia !
Just beat Darvel, Dons, even AFC 1 nil over Darvel will do, come on get over it by winning there Aberdeen 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Come on you reds I mean
Coyr
Am listening to Rangers tv.
Well done Dons, keep going, we will succeed eventi
Nice to see tav embracing and leading morelas out 😂😂😂🍀🇮🇪
I feel sorry for Aberdeen playing against 17 men. Rangers, Officials and VAR, Video Assisting Rangers.
Can't believe that Red Card Should be suspended for 10 games No attempt at the ball Could have ended the lads career Anyway justice done Bye bye Sheep 🐑
Wtf was that tackle by the Aberdeen captain though, very clear red
Mon the gets smash them watp
🤫 🤫
, surely, like, govan, clown, beale, ange, will, get, the, luck, and, take, the, deal, no, more, 2goallies,, goldson, and, v, a, r, jota, kyoko, and, maeda, will, be, the, stars, so, injured, player, beale, put, on, roofe, hows, your, arm, wont, be, singing, any, sons, haha
Nice to see morelos leading the gers out.... ☠️
Kel Brooke
Rangers showed their class, but that aberdeen striker did look spicy
Scary stuff rangers really need new blood job done tho 😅
Stewart really cost Aberdeen today, That was a ridiculous challenge to make and not needed. Thought the ref and VAR where actually ok today not the best but Aberdeen played very well to be fair to them. If i was an Aberdeen fan i would be fuming at my Captain he cost them dearly today.
the, govan, clown, got, you, s out, of, jail, card, again, but, that, clowns, monopoly, wont, be, on, 26th, as, ange, has, one, better, he,, s a, wizzard, and, waves, a, magic, wand, the, govan, clown, plays, a, lucky, dip, and, ange, has, a, good, big, whip, haha, the, dobber
McGregor is done, sorry to say but he is, when he’s been tricked he shows no interest to try and save it just doesn’t bother… keeper problem is an issue, feel bad for McGregor, he should of retired last season he’s just spoiling his legacy here…
Rangers vs Japan let’s go
Rangers are shite worst team I've seen in years and I'm a Gers fan for 60 Yeats they have no killing instinct like Celtic do
Rangers should be happy tonight we all know that the sheep give everything they have against us like they don’t with any1 else so beating them AGAIN is a decent result…it’s just a shame for them half the fans they brought to hampden they won’t see again all season…😂watp 🇬🇧
agame, like, that, when, the, dons, run, you, s ragged, wont, be, like, that, against, celtic, the, tim, alloys, were, the, holders, and, ange, likes, to, keep, it, up, thats, why, we, will, hold, on, to, this, cup, maybe, next, year, beale, haha
How dare Aberdeen give 100% in a semi final , it’s very frustrating as well for us Tims watching an average St. Mirren side try harder against Celtic than Rangers or an average Livingston side have a “jinx “ over us away from home for years yet lose to Rangers regularly is it like this ?
Luckyst Club on earth....with var....hh 😁
why, are, you, raw, deale, beale, so, much, in, f,,,ken, luck, aberdeen, should, have, bet, you, stoday, they, were, the, better, team, but, then, beale, your, luck, did, run, out, put, on, roofe, and, that, showed, no, truth, as, he, s injured, again, and, your, to, blame, as, seen, on, his, face, he, was, in, pain,
What a great game for rangers won 2-1 against Abradeen
Great to Roofe get the winner
Aberdeen only turning up for rangers and they are still pish, cheating their fans the gimps. Even better jack and wright playing big parts in the goals hahahaha
Again super Ian Beale gets helped out once again woodwork, deflection and a red card. We just can’t laugh enough
It’s so bitterly disappointing yet again. The last 2 games against this lot we’ve been the architects of our own downfall. The collapse at home and now our so called captain selling us down the river. It’s so naive of Stewart to make that challenge especially since, against this lot, any ref in the league is looking for any chance to make a dismissal. Awful display from our captain.   I thought the lads put in a very good effort, even down at 10 men in extra time. McGregor saved his team from embarrassment with that save at the end. It was good to see Bojan back on the scoresheet after a dry spell. Hopefully that’ll get his confidence back up, and he’ll be banging them in until the end of the season. His goals are a crucial part to our success.   Let’s get some defenders in and drop that useless, poor excuse of a footballer who isn’t fit enough to wash the kits never mind wear one!
Well done the Gers, once again the sheep only show up in games against the famous, they've been cheating their own fans for years . Hope it's a long journey back up the road for them. WATP
Did anyone see the Rangers ‘ultras’ at the end? 😂😂  Much like the Green Brigade, a group of angry young men who think because they smuggle pyrotechnics into a game they are hard. 😂
4:31  even the cameraman was like holy shit 😂
That pitch was atrocious but what do you expect, the nappy rippers get preference again on it, no way should two semi finals be played on it, disgraceful
whay do commentators say that the bar denied a goal - it really annoys me.  If it hits the bar or the post then it's off target, the woodwork doesn't prevent a goal.
Fatso shuda been booked for that challenge no surprise he wasn't.
Embarrassment of a pitch
Great game of football, Aberdeen played superb today, could have went either way. Roll on the final, can't wait for it, very confident celtic will win this Cup.
Well done Rangers, give them hell in the Final.🇬🇧Millwall loyal🇬🇧
Only one goal chopped off for Aberdeen ? No penalties for rangers ? What’s going on ?
Again Aberdeen play out of their skin against us. Must be very frustrating for Aberdeen fans that they don’t do that regularly.
It's amazing how many Celtic fans spent 2+ hours of their Sunday watching the rangers game. How obsessed must they be?
see you in the final sevco scum # mon the celtic
The Aberdeen goal reminded me of the goal in yesterday's Man U vs Man City in that the Rangers players were defending against an offside player when an onside player got the ball and passed it to the previously offside player, now onside, who scored. I'm not saying the Aberdeen goal should have been disallowed but the Man U goal should have been, so where for you draw the line?
Scott Wright, defo has been taking those performance enhancement drugs. I've never seen him doing so well in a long time.
Mon the hoops
A lucky deflection for their 1st goal and playing against 10 men. Usually they get their penalty to get them out of trouble.  It’s the sevco way.  They won’t be that lucky against Celtic. That’s for sure.
Beat 10 men   no Biggie bit luck
Fashion Sakala has been player for Rangers since GIO left
Fs we're in a final.. Negative comments on here..., closet gers fans 🇬🇧
Sick fed u0 with Stewart. Another red card, the captains armband should be taken off him.
Sheep shagging b@stards
Why not show Barisics two footed lunge he got yellow, as bad as Stewarts? Why not show Kent punching Scales, clear red card he has history.
Huns got lucky
Good match for a neutral & for scottish football.  Although from a Rangers POV it might seem like a good victory in isolation but looking at the bigger picture, they really never ever seem comfortable at Hampden!  I don't think there's one single match in the last decade where Rangers were comfortable winners.  You'd think that would tell u something, but no....  the same old faces remain.  Really don't understand that.   Kent is such a wimp wearing gloves when it's not even snowing or anything.  Or he's an African who's just comd to Scotland for the 1st time a few weeks ago & is used to it being hot all year around, so it's a sudden change.  And last sesson he was even wearing gloves in MAY!!!
WTF was wee Wright thinking with a couple of minutes left? I do forgive him though...
Rangers are sheer shite . Mr bean was lucky the day .
Nice for tav to walk morelos out on the field, shows solidarity through his difficult weight loss journey, a true captain
Morelos tackle was a studs up stamp he should have walked first half ,hard to see but looks like Aberdeen had good goal disallowed no surprise again old firm bias in affect .can’t wait till jan 28 th uefa enforce financial rules 70%budget .there fake accounts showing profit .sold shares again and 3 mill loan .to break even after final 30 mill for 2 players .that doesn’t pay back 90 mill they lost since new club .have 11 pay Aussie there fucked sooner happens better for Scot’s footie
Back in the sheep pen Dolly. Aberdeen scum.
Rangers beat these teams but get spanked 7-1 in Europe. That shows their level
The pound shop galacticos 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Sakalawere was your smile after that tackle shower of lucky animals
The park was like a coo field
Always beat they Mutton molesters dominated this game again Ryan jack 🔴⚪🔵 scoring v them 2-1 4-1 3-2
Aberdeen see shit lmao
These videos are shockingly edited. Lack of replays etc.
Mon the gers🇬🇧
Come on the rangers
Very cool👏👏
