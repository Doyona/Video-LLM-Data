Who's here after Liverpool 0-1 Brighton
Here after 0-1
How the he'll was the first penny a penno
Welbeck was offside anyway so it shouldnt of stood
Next season needs to be no VAR in my opinion! Finding it hard to watch, preferred football without VAR
A toe offside 30 metres from the other player, it's not how the rule was designed to be.
BT need to replace Steve Mcmanaman worst commentator going
People are saying oh  liverpool are still doing well with injured players this game could have easily been 4-1 or 4-2 for brighton
2:11 commentator says "touch by your handbag" should be sacked!
Toe offside!
Who in the right mind still entertains this stuff? The premier league is well and truly finished. This is not a sport, it’s like a snide, unfunny comedy show.
VAR is such a joke.
Liverpool got robbed
L-Pool got robbed again
Everyone complaining about VAR needs to stop watching games.  If viewers drop and it’s made known that it’s because of VAR, they’ll remove it
Number 4 Brighton defender arm is playing mane onside
VAR has killed football, I’ve lost complete interest in the game
Just goes to show that sky sports is quicker
Var Refs are useless
idk how liverpool fans can complain at all... Robertson literally kicked welbeck
Everyone Sub to raheem joker pls
If that’s a penalty then why wasn’t villa’s against Brighton last weekend given. No consistency and the officiating including var has been a disaster.
People sending Maupay so much hate, he’s only human. Leave the man alone
What's wrong with Klopp ? His player clearly kicked DW. An obvious PENALTY !!!
Liverpool robbed again
Lmao that penalty. What has happened to the English game. Pathetic
How did Brighton not win they missed an open goal and missed a pen
Im not even a liverpool fan but this var thing is a joke
all var decisions were correct. kicking the player not the ball is a penalty
a toe offside what a joke of the offside rule  spoiling the game of football
Tbh I might stop supporting Liverpool not bc I'm plastic but I want to support my local  team Shrewsbury who are in league one a season ticket holder for them and I won't have the time to go to anfield to watch Liverpool
So we ain't gonna talk about them 2 harsh of sides
Hope chelsea do spurs in
My love of the game is dying with VAR. Sucking everything away. I am okay with it being used for ‘clear and obvious’ but now it’s the VAR show and every attacker falls overs now (like Welbeck)with the most minimal of contact as they know when slowed down it will show the smallest contact and get a penalty. I don’t think every contact warrants a penalty. Players are allowed to compete. If not I am losing interest in this sport we call football. Sad times
0:57 the technique to chip the goalie by salah
Joke
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please lord... They need to either seriously change the way they use VAR or scrap it because its ruining football... (arsenal fan)
2 goals disallowed,2 pens.   var wins against Liverpool.
Just blatant cheating, disgusting really‼️
I don’t know how people have the cheek to say “Livarpool”
Brighton are shocking infront of goal who ever is their finishing coach is he needs sacking and quick, can see them getting relegated this season if they carryon like that.
So Salah can run? And even last the whole match? Yet there was me hearing scientists on the news " scienintists that are allways 100% right" that Covid damages everyone's lungs for life 🤣🤣
Don't know what people are complaining about. All the decisions seem fair and a fair score for the game.
Klopp going back to Germany
Klopp needs to pipe down. Never thought I would say it but he's becoming pretty unlikeable.
Liverpool had 2 goals rules out
We were so lucky to get that penalty. I can’t even lie
I remember last season ast villa vs Liverpool.. we scored in the dying minutes, and robbo taking the ball back to kick start and we wanted to win tht match.. here, shoulders dropped, no one is encouraging others... heads up guys comeon... long season...
So sad. Poor old Liverpool :(((
imagine supporting Liverpool and drawing against Brighton jesus
Well that is like 2 players jumping for a header in box where there is a head clash and only one player making contact with ball.  To me it wasn’t a penalty because Wellbeck never had control or possession of the ball.  Both players were attempting a play at the ball and there was accidental contact.  Wellbeck goes down 5 hours later.
Liverpool are awful Liverpool won’t be that good
Brighton was all over them should’ve bagged 4 goals
Jota's finish the highlight of an otherwise disappointing afternoon.
This Isn't football anymore it's a joke  the game is in ruins,para
Ffs, Welbeck took 3 steps, realised we were gonna counter and fell over 😂
Off should’ve won that fair and square
Spurs will win easy
There was contact blah blah blah..... ZZZzzzzzzzzzz Liverpool should have been more clinical TBH
Why did he take of Salah and not the useless firmino???
The way things are going if Liverpool win the title this season Klopp has to be classified as the greatest manager ever.  VAR decisions, injuries, scheduling all conspiring against Liverpool this season
LiVARpool? They had 2 goals ruled out by VAR and gave away 2 penalties smh
فقط جهانبخش jahanbakhsh
How is that a pen ffs
Maupay should be on less pay
That var is just ridiculous....one toe....or Robertson and wellbeck wtf
Diogo jota is an amazing signing
They really don't want liverpool to win this year huh
Liverpool were by far the better team
to be honest i think the law makers in football and var are purposely changing the game so they get controversial moments and everyone speak about it
Daylight robbery is alive and well
Is thiago ever coming back?? The guy been in light training weeks ago. Get him back into team training. Shaqiri matip kieta and thiago sell them off if there not fit for this league. Paying them a fortune every month and there never fit
The game is rigged.
Jota has been fenominal this season, he has a good future ahead of him
Claim your here before "1 million views " ticket here
Var is the biggest jokes 🤣 😂 .
Commentators are so annoying
Where’s matip
saw a lot of liverpool fans and henderson say thats not a pen lol
He kicks his foot obviously but it’s such a small thing. Everything is coming down to the minor details now and it’s really taking the fun out of the sport. How can a team take any risks anymore? Rules need a switch up I think
Welbeck took 2 more steps then fell
Var helped Liverpool numerous times last season & now they moan
play adrian at RB
Liverpool are getting found out At the back. There good side but could of been done today.
Been robbed again
“Always look on the Brighton side of life...
Anyone saying LiVARpool can shut up now, not one important decision went our way
As a united fan at this point I feel bad for Liverpool fans😂😂  No more liVARpool😪😪
For the Salah 'goal', did the VAR official draw the line from the defender's foot or from his shoulder/upper arm?  Surely, looking at his body position, the shoulder would be further back than his foot, thus playing Salah onside...or is it only Liverpool & Leeds players that are allowed to touch the ball with the shoulder/upper arm?
This league is a joke! I don't even like Liverpool and I feel bad for them
Brighton have themselves to blame by  missing 2 open chances early on... Liverpool were lucky today
The Var decisions were all correct 🤷‍♂️
“LiVARpool”
As a spurs fan yes happy they got the pen.BUT I its a soft pen and I don't agree with it this week Liverpool next week someone else the rules do.need a change
Brighton should of been 2-nil up early doors
a better team than brighton would thrash this Liverpool side, Spurs and Chelsea would beat this Liverpool team
it should be 3 1 its not offside
It was a penalty definitely,I support liverpool myself,the fact is we was not good enough,end of💯
Klopps face at the end! HAHAHAHAHA
I don’t understand why anyone is crying over the VAR decisions- all 3 were correct no debate
Who ever wins tomorrow Chelsea vs spurs Is  1st in prem COYB!!!! HOPEFULLY CHELSEA WIN TOMORROW 🙏💙🙌💪
To be fair Brighton probably should have won the game with the chances they created.
I laughed when they scored Tue pen in the final minute
Poor old Klopp. Its a foul and a penalty. Unlucky
That didn’t look deliberate in my opinion
As a Spurs fan 😂😂😂
Football is meant to be a contact sport. The clearance of Robertson when he caught Welbeck just says it all really. The FA and VAR have spoiled our game for good. I'd probably get more joy watching Tabletennis.
VAR was actually spot on in this game
Neco Williams went to do a cross but then passed it back quite a few times in the match
Stick that in your pipe Mr. Plopp💩 sorry Mr. Klopp  😂
Studs were showing, freekick Liverpool. LOL
COYS!
Again bs, remove VAR it’s ruining football, salah isnt off nor was mane months ago
I sink
Klip klopp was lucky to get a draw,
Klopps face. He is thinking  "for fack sake"
For VAR to work effectively and with transparency, the referees need to be 🎤 up so everyone can hear what's being looked at and why.   Then, instead of showing ultra slow motion replays, they also need to show the footage at normal speed to reaffirm what the referee has seen at the time.
That's the dumbest penalty decision ever. wtf  is this lol
HAHAHAHA LiVARpool having a taste of their own medicine. Then their moaning manager getting bodied in the post-match interview. *L.*
Point gained for Liverpool
What a retardation of refereeing. I cant even watch this sht football anymore.
VAR. Clear and obvious when it suits them.
Liverpool fans cannot whinge about VAR at all. Look at last season VAR bailed them out on bullshit decisions so many times
Disgraceful penalty
Just saying that’s similar to salah against West Ham with feet to feet contact which was weak in power and then salah went down over emphatically and accused of diving but welbeck had been kicked in the studs which shouldn’t hurt and then lands acts normal and then a few seconds later goes down in “excruciating pain”. Non were pens but Welbeck shouldn’t get away with the critism which Salah got
I want var to die
plz watch my vid if u have a massive shlong would mean a lot
The game has truly gone if they're giving penalties for that.
Jota still wont get a TOTW in fifa
Who is jota shushing ? The fans ?😂
Jota is signing of the season. Change my mind
I can’t believe this. This is a game that we should have won. Brighton pen is one mistake. Definitely not a pen. Game blown away.
Liverpool lucky to draw Brighton let them off the hook
HA HA COYS
As a Liverpool fan I'll admit we looked awful today. Brighton could have had four or 5 goals.
Bernd Leno is laughing somewhere
Var is awful and misused. That pen is no where near conclusive enough to overturn a decision which is the reason for VAR
Liverpool are the new Manchester United: riding their luck!
If anyone wants to watch free games go to live sport tv
Klopps really ugly.Makes me look handsome.
Disgraceful to go down a second after the challenge, the fact they didn’t sky the penalty deliberately is just wrong in so many ways.   VAR ruins football
LIVERPOOL REST IN PISSSSSSSSSSS
How did Brighton not beat such a small club
This "sport" has become a joke these days! it's more like "MMA" than football.
LivArpOoL
Liverpool fans complaining over clear offsides. 😂
VAR is a joke!!! 😡
Get Maupay off penalties. He concedes penalties to the other team and misses them my shock
Diogo Jota has officially replaced Firmino
Football is not enjoyable anymore!!
It good to see VAR playing well against it's former club
Welbeck fell over literally 5 minutes after contact
Liverpool's second goal 3:02
Why didn’t West Brom get a pen when Bruno did the exact same thing Robertson done????
Commentators are supposed to be neutral  BT Sport: *hehe let’s put a scouser in for a laugh.*
Jota's rating in Fifa 21 is a joke
Fantastic
Brighton  should  be  proud  guys  should  have being  3 - 1   Liverpool  were  poor  2  day  🙄
Maupay is the biggest crybaby ever honestly but Brighton deserved man
great decision for the pen
Salah certainly wasn’t happy with being subbed of
Liverpool nightmare
Another injury to add the never ending list for lfc
Jota can't stop scoring
Just goes to show that sky sports is quicker
0:36 penalty miss 0:58 salah offside 1:15 Jota 2:00 mane offside 2:26 pen given 2:28 equaliser pen 1-1
Liverpool we’re robbed
No one cares sky put their highlights up half an hour ago
The worst penalty decision I’ve seen. Welbeck stands up for about 5 seconds before he decides to go down. VAR and the officials are ruining football, simple as
Disgusting tackle by Robertson 😡🤬. Ruining the game. Get well soon Danny Welbeck 🕊🙌🏼😭
Liverpool robbed
The wheels are starting to fall off...... 🚎
I’ve never been first before
I'm a Liverpool fan and I'll admit brighton worthy of a point but can we really sustain giving 2 pens on average a match all season. Does literally everything just end up as a penalty now
As a Chelsea fan a feel like VAR is against liverpool from winning the premier league this season
Ty would have been proud of the penalty maupey took
I'm a united fan but var 1-1 liverpool
This is gonna make Chelsea vs Spurs even more exciting :)
Come on Brighton 🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙
Neal Maupay is living proof that karma exists.
Liverpool are skunked! 🤣
VAR is piss
Already watched on sky
Hi first
