Portugal should have won
Everyone gives kepa grief but he made a few important saves
Yet again Portugal are a underdog but still a force to reckoned with
Ronaldo didn't dive this time
Keepa was beaten but the bar saved him
Who even plays for Spain these days...
You know that football has hit a low point when kepa keeps a clean sheet against you
Funny seeing Adama taking on semedo and Neves for it to be saved by Patrício. Just shows how far wolves have clme
The title should be: Adama Traore played against Wolves
Portugal 0 crossbar 2
I never know wolves can play national teams?
The title proves how much of a shock it is that Kepa acc kept a clean sheet for once🤣🤣🤣🤣 to think people were saying this guy is better than De Gea as well just because he replaced him for a few friendlies last year that had no importance at all🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ deluded Chelsea fans at their worst😆😆😆😆 De Gea hasn’t been himself since the last WC but he’s defo not dropped all the way down to the level that Kepa is at❌❌
if they keep kepa in goal. Spain wont get far this euro
The crossbar keeps a Clean Sheet
All I’m saying is Trossard against Kepa: Scores Ronaldo against Kepa: Nothing
Portugal looking so good there squad is amazing! Portugal is my pick for euro or nations maybe world cup
Ronaldo stays in the air for 5 seconds before he touches the ground - madting
Portugal looking very good. Imagine if they win the World Cup. Ronaldo would become the best undisputedly
New title “crossbar keeps kepa with a clean sheet
I still can't believe the big clubs didn't go for Traore this summer! Guys a beast
That pass from Ronaldo worth something...
Title - Kepa keeps a clean sheet....  Crossbar - Yep, thanks to me, and I got no hands. Who's ur daddy!
Chelsea need to loan the crossbar while Mendy is injured
That title is deep
Kepa, KEPA?
Real title should be: 'Crossbar keeps clean sheet for Spain'
Kepa keeping a clean sheet for the first time.
Dislike 👎
2 crossbars and both on the line. VERY unlucky to not win. Highlights are all Portugal too!
Not bad from Spain C team
1 shot on goal 😂😂😂
When the video starts in the 42nd minute you know it was a 'good' game 🤣
Oh my have Spain gone bad
Let's see who can answer this. If a dog is tied to a piece of rope that is 6m long, how can he reach a bone that is 7m away?
What is the worst moment in this match?
I like the new wolves kit, Red very bold
Alternate title: Crossbar keeps a clean sheet for spain
Cross-bar keeps a clean sheet
Who the bloody hell is Keppa? Is that edible?🤣
The fact Spain are playing Kepa over de gear and dean Henderson still hasn’t even been given his chance in the united side is a joke.
Cristiano Ronaldo is clearly the best player ever. 🐐
I think even if there was no goalkeeper for Spain, still it would be a clean sheet
Carvalho and Felix need to start against France
The woodwork made more saves than Kepa.
Kepa keeped a clean sheet: more like the cross bar kept a clean sheet
It should have been like 4-0 to Portugal
Kepa kept a clean sheet because he had Sergio Romas in defence which Sergio Ramos is a tank whereas if kepa was playing in the prem he won't keep a cleansheet becsuse the defenders are not great eg. Zouma can't defend
More like the woodwork kept a clean sheet 😂
You know your country has gone downhill when the crossbar makes two saves to your keepers one and that a clean sheet makes the title of the video.
What a miss that is at the end.
The fact they even say kepa kept a clean sheet but made one save A class work there 👏
Kepa: look guys clean sheet  Also Kepa: look guys I made a save.
Sky sports were so shocked kepa kept a clean sheet it was the title lmaoo 🤣
As if 2020 couldn’t get any stranger...
They need to change it to “woodwork keeps clean sheet against Portugal” not kepa
Portugal couldn't beat Spain's 3rd team?
Love being a wolves fan :)
Adams Traore is Spanish?? 👀😱
Portugal hit the woodwork (2) more times than  kepa made saves (1)  yet its still title worthy 😂
If you believe that there’s no God and that nothing made the universe. Then if God is no-thing and therefore is nothing. Then can’t the universe come from him?  Also if you believe that the universe is infinite; then how is it that our bodies are part of the universe whilst our consciousness is also part of our bodies whilst our consciousness came into existence via our birth? This means that our consciousness is finite because it began, there for our bodies are finite and finally the universe MUST be finite...This is what Islam promotes...
Both National teams played with reserves to test them. Spain did win especially first half in terms of possession. But in terms of control of game and clear goal attempts, We should have won, PORTUGAL. Ronaldo and Sanches strikes speak for themselves. It was a good game though. We had players in Portugal that had never played before like Ruben Semedo .. as well as in Spain like the beast Adama Traore. Overall nice match.
Kepa actually made a save? A clean sheet?! Rahhhh he's desperately trying to get back into the Chelsea starting XI
Fans!!
Title of video:  Portugal’s keeper: Am I a joke too you?
Kepa didn't keep a clean sheet the  crossbar did 😂😂😂
Patricio makes a better save than Kepa, if Kepa got in front of either one of those Portugal chances he would've been turned to dust!
New title: The crossbar keeps a clean sheet in Portugal 0 - 0 Spain deadlock!
who the video said got the clean sheet=kepa  who actually got a clean sheet= the crossbar
Spain got away with that one
crossbar keeps kepa a clean sheet*
Wolves should be able to use the Portugal training ground 😂
Kepa a country man Let’s just count how many saves he made ............1
The shithousery award goes to sky sports
Keep didnt even deserve a clean sheet
Basically kepa made less saves than the woodwork 🙈 classic kepa
Tf they picking kepa
Make a Poland Finland highlights video that game was a banger
Portugal had one shot on target and Kepa saved it might not seem like much but its one more save than De gea made in the world cup
Title should read 'Crossbar keeps a clean sheet for Spain'
Should have really read that Portugal missed all their chances, Kepa didn't do much
This video should be titled Crossbar Keeps a Clean Sheet for Spain
Raphael Gurriero - can we please talk about that volley you shanked out of the arena?
How on earth did Portugal not win this game. Another great performance from Ronaldo the man is a machine indeed!
I love how sky uses puts kept and clean sheet in there title to show how shocking it is
They did kepa dirty in the title😂😂
Okay but isn't that what kepa is supposed to be doing anyway
'Kepa keeps clean sheet for Spain' #22 on trending
Wolves played quite well this game, they definitely should’ve beaten Spain!
How on earth is Kepa getting selected for Spain? Bad times.
The fact he only made one save and it makes the title. Half the match he was there doing what he does best looking at the ball as it hits the woodwork.
This title hoed Kepa 😂😂
2:10 I hope he can pull of saves like that got for Chelsea when he gets the chance
How bad is kepa omg. Positioning is dreadful especially for that last opportunity for Portugal
Kepa can't keep a clean sheet in Chelsea smh
no goals, no views 🤣
This is kepa’s twin brother can’t be kepa
The title should be "the crossbar keeps clean sheet for Spain"
Helps when u don’t have to panic about a shitty defence getting picked ahead of De Gea 😂😂
Highlights of a 0-0 match? Clickbait
Kepa literally did nothing to deserve the title wtf
Who didn't know adama traore was Spanish cuz I never 🤔🤔🤔
The crossbar made more saves than kepa 😂😂😂
Put some respect on Kepa his first Cleansheet of the season
He needs a medal
Well as a Portuguese grandson I was actually glad that we drew because it means my spanish grandma will be happy
KEPA OR THE POST ?
Highlight start at 42nd minute of first half...
title should say cross bar does the work for kepa clean sheet
This is the best Portugal squad so far.. Spain was luckey  crossbar saved them a lot.
Clicked because of the title.
The more Messi and Ronaldo get older the more you realise none of these new players can lace Ron or messi's boots. Shocking miss from Felix.
The crossbar keeps a clean sheet for Kepa*
Imagine betting on Portugal to win and the cross bar's like no not today 😁
the title should be the crossbar keeps a clean sheet for spain
Title is taking the piss lol
On another day this would’ve ended 4-0
For £113m for Joao Felix I think we can safely call that miss of the decade
Danilo- PSG. Value- 24M Cancelo-City. Value- 36M Bernardo Silva- City. Value- 80M Bruno Fernandes- United. Value- 70M Jota- Liverpool. Value- 28M Joao Felix- Atletico Madrid. Value- 80M Ruben Días- City. Value- 35M Trincao- Barcelona. Value- 30M Nelson Semedo- Wolves. Value- 40M   And Portugal is just Ronaldo.
Ronaldo is a real game changer with a long term quality.
‘Kepa keeps a clean sheet’  Everyone: 👁👄👁
Felix is so overrated!!
Portugal are suddenly stacked
the crossbar was a better goalkeeper than kepa
1:14 what a goal that would’ve been
Honestly can't comprehend how Joao Felix has missed that. 99.9% of the time, any player (amateur or pro) would tap that in
Everyone’s always on Kepa’s back. He ain’t the best keeper but I’ve certainly seen worse. Stop ripping him and he might be a bit more consistent...
Felix and the crossbar are probably to thank for that clean sheet
NO PENALT NO PARTY. LITHUANIA MAN IS NOTHING WITHOUT Lithuania Luxemburg Andora and PENALTY..
How Wolves never won this game is a mystery.
The title of this makes out as if  Kepa kept spain in the match with alot of saves...... Really he only did 1 save apart from that I do not see anything worth talking about. Portugal should have won the game tbh
How Spain went from Iniesta, Villa, Silva to Traore LMAO
Had no idea Traore was Spanish
More like the crossbar keeps a clean sheet
This Portugal team is insane
i mean it was a lucky clean sheet ngl
new portugal kit is beautiful, just red and green, classic!
The crossbar did most of the work
So many Wolfs in this match
ADAMA traore played against his team :) (wolves) like on training
Correction. The crossbar and João Felix's miss kept a clean sheet for Kepa
CR7 best ⚽️👈
BREAKING NEWS:  Spain have bought the services of the crossbar for a fee of £500
Adama looks dangerous
Keeps hardly saved any shots, it was such a lucky clean sheet
As a neutral watching the way Spain approached this game was so disappointing, had lots of possession but never looked to break it forward, it seemed they were just happy to avoid defeat really unpleasant to see 😑 Portugal deserved the win but failed to capitalise on their chances
Portugal got a great team plenty of options to choose from
Feels like a game of fifa lol
Hail to kepa the goat
Of all the international games, this is the one I would of thought would have the most goals
Crossbar and Joao Felix kept a clean sheet for Spain
Wolves vs Spain
wolves are looking good
Kepa is starting because de gea conceded 6 and Adrian conceded 7
fario island lativa moldova belarus macedonia luxembourg andorra hero dont even score in friendly much agians big nation
What is this sorcery??
Well the cross bar  saved him twice !
kepa didn’t save no crucial shots the crossbar did
Cristiano "Quaresma" Ronaldo vs Kepa "Very Lucky" Arrizabalaga
Ansu fati
Answer fati
Great game Portugal.
Traore's physicality is a joke
De gea better he was very  lucky kepa de gea can slip but on his day he is great.
2:16 how is that corner even allowed. Look where the ball is placed glad there was no goal involved
So many goals in this game
Forget the score so good to see Portugal wearing Red and Green again love the new kit we have to keep the green shorts going forward hated the all red
And only made 1 highlight save
I love how the main highlight is kepa’s clean sheet😂😂😂
this is big news to me
I'm surprised he can't keep one for chelsea
Portugal are a fine team now. I didn't rate them much 2016 Euros. It was like a One Man team but they have some really good players and good team bond hence why they do well.   Tables have turned. Portugal better than Spain now. I used to support Spain when they played Tikitaki well such ways with iniesta and xavi. As Liverpool fc fan, back in mid 2000s lots of spanish players were at Liverpool. I felt Spain had something special hence why started liking them.
Why is kepa playing I’d rather have my 5 year old brother who hates football
i think the crossbar kept a clean sheet.....kepa was beaten everytime.....again...
And idiots say Ronaldo is only a goal scorer
I'm upset that we didn't win this game even tho it was just a friendly... But we move, vamos Portugal 🇵🇹❤️❤️❤️❤️
Anybody can see the Portugal'S potential.
Someone the size of adama should not be allowed to run that fast🤣🤣hes actually such a scary player
Those who watched the match will know there were many more chances that were not shown here. I am Portuguese but Spain had fair few soft chances first half that were simply not shown and even that amazing play between felix and jota late game that were not shown
0:27 oh look its a first team international professional multi-millionaire football who can't kick a ball with his right foot, lets forgive him, I mean *afterall*.. he is 'ONLY' a left-back.
Kepa still looked awful.
Spanish crossbar MOTM
The crossbar made more saves then kepa
Ronaldo is beast. Only thing stopped him from a goal and assist was the bar. Guy Performs and shows up for every team, unlike that overrated Argentinian.
Portugal let me down for 400 quid only team to not win
I dont believe it ahhh Morocco
Kepa did fuckall the crossbar was MOTM
Luckiest clean sheet ever
Kepa made one average save? He was so lucky not to concede 3 goals.
kepa > de gea
We should have won against Spain
Pissed wolves didn't win this one
Spains lineup was so average tonight, Portugal should have finished them off
Ronaldo was generous for Spain tonight
Kepa did nothing. He wasn't even close to any of the shots that hit the bars
Remember when spain had casillas now they hav kepa and de gea lol
Yet again ronaldo goes blank against a big team on the international stage don't care he hit the crossbar etc
Even sky sports know how crap Kepa is
0:26 super jump 0:44 left foot beam  1:15 KDB type pass   35 btw 🐐
Mourinho needs to check Spain’s goalposts. Either that or Man United should sign them- more chance of keeping a clean sheet
CR7 is an animal
The crossbar keeps a clean sheet for spain*
Spain have had the biggest downgrade internationally over the years
Nahhh Kepa still making the same mistakes standing still loool. It could have ended 3-0 to Portugal but Spain got lucky.
They wrote that as a title cuz recently he’s said he wants to change things and will try best to turn stuff around at Chelsea, Kepa had personal issues too after his first decent year
Portugal: Hello woodwork my old friend...
Kepa should honour those gloves and frame them. It'll be a great achievement this result when he looks back at his career 😂
A momentous occasion in the history of football . The first time it has ever been done
*Portugal miss lots of great chances against Kepa.
Worst keeper in the world keeps clean sheet 🤦🏽‍♂️
Wolves were unlucky tonight
Kepa?! I only saw Portugal's keeper and the crossbar keep clean sheets...
The title hahaha
Beautiful performance by Portugal
Why was Kepa even on the pitch in the first place?
Just a few  centimetres here and there and this game could easily have been about 4-0 to Portugal 🇵🇹 Ronaldo is a machine still. Kepa somehow kept a clean sheet and still looked shite
So nostalgic listening to Rob Palmer commentate on Ronaldo
Clickbait title, he barely did anything.
That crossbar needs surgery after those two strikes!
Did the goalies union write the video description??
The title has me in tears
the post kept the clean sheet
1:16 And people wonder why Ronaldo can’t get as many assists
ronaldo can do everything in the game for me the best player ever. simply the goat
Kepa is soo bad
Alternative title:  Woodwork and Poor Portuguese finishing, gifts Spain a Clean Sheet
just here for adama
Spain 0-0 Wolves
Ronaldo floats in the air .
What about Patricio??
Ronaldo fails to score is a better click bait
Kepa keeps clean sheet! Shows one save
Kepa didnt deserve this clean sheet. As a minimum Portugal should have won 2-1
This was such a dissapointing game  Especially since I'm Portuguese, its like watching the old firm derby but they all respect each other and there's no goals
This was such a dissapointing game  Especially since I'm Portuguese, its like watching the old firm derby but they all respect each other and there's no goals
Can't wait for the Renato come back
More like Crossbar keeps clean sheet for Spain! Ronaldo GOAT! So unlucky to not score or grab an assist today! that pass was something else!
Ronaldo is in the form of his life right now, a more complete player than his time at Madrid even
Kepa should bring them goal posts to Chelsea made more saves than him
Chelsea should sign this goal great saves it did 👌
Its Wolves vs. Spain...but Spain were one short so Wolves gave them Traore for the match
You coulda’ said he kepa clean sheet atleast 😂
Damn, we replace Kepa, AND THEN he keeps a clean sheet😂
Wolves were great tonight
Kepa was beaten on at least 3 situations in these highlights. Not much he could do granted.. but it's not like he kept a clean sheet because of anything he personally did. Made 1 good save with his legs. That's it.
Both teams with plenty of playmakers and creators... But not a goal predator in sight.
It looks like we've found the next yashin guys HAHAHAHAH    SICASTIC YOU KNOW IT 😂
Why is kepa in the title he made one ok save the crossbar mad two great saves 😂
Messi clowns triggered again !!!😂😂😂
Spain only had 1 chance?
Felix is so overhyped
Wow how much of a vandetta does one need to have against De Gea to have Kepa in goal over him....
man said they trusted that fraud kepa in goal they were begging to concede as many goals as possible
Nice to see Wolves keep a clean sheet against Portugal
Sky Sports just straight mocking Kepa with that title
“Goalposts keep clean sheet”
he saved 1 goal in that highlight video ahaha
Wait he did something???
it was kepa day as the goal and posts stand with him most of the time he was unlucky but this game should give him some confidence
Adama is just playing a training match against the rest of wolves
Keeps a clean sheet and happens to be a friendly ahaha
Kepa doing some juju black magic to keep all them goals out.
Kepa keeps a clean sheet just by a bit of good fortune many hit the bar and could have gone in on another day
The crossbar kept a clean sheet, not Kepa.
I thought this was clickbait
Adama Traore is just built differently
Bruno Bernardo and Felix didn’t start neither did Ruben dias so minor
“ kepa keeps a clean sheet” more like the crossbar keeps a clean sheet lol.
How on earth did Felix not score
Crossbar keeps a clean sheet and signs for Chelsea
It was a friendly. Portugal and Spain didn’t play their best in the first half
Why the hell is kepa their first keeper?
Never thought i would see this title..
Lmao he made one save from a weak shot, he was saved by the crossbar
Okay who are you and what have you done with the real Kepa
Is Spains reign as the best Iberian team over?
Pity De Gea wasn't in the net again for Ronaldo to make him look like a mug in front of the world AGAIN
The crossbar did more work than Kepa 😂
Ronaldo playing with players who can’t finish throughout his career is y he has less assists than Messi. Renato Sanchez proving that today.
I think I read the title wrong
Kepa got lucky
Portugal have gotten incredibly strong.
Think sky sports mean THE CROSS BAR KEPT A CLEAN SHEET 😂😭
Cristiano Ronaldo best player ever CR7 ♾
Crossbar saves kepa again
kepa is so bad that they titled the video about him keeping a clean sheet
Woodwork saved Spain more than Kepa
The crossbar saved Spain's ass
If Felix started Portugal would have won. Trincao is useless.
Sky Sports with the shade 🤣
wtf was this match ronaldo deserved that first goal and that renato assist
Wolves vs spain
Spain had 4-5 chances in first 30 mins... These highlights start at 43 min ... Wtf
What a thumbnail 🙄 come on sky
Woodwork made more saves
That title 😂 😂 😂
Well, he can kepa clean sheet
Crossbar made more saves in 90 mins than kepa in a whole season
Luckeist clean sheet i ever seen in my life
Great contribution from the manager!
Can't believe you made Kepa the focus of your title. He hardly did anything. Portugal were very unlucky to have smacked the bar twice with two fantastic efforts created by Ronaldo.
The only way this year can get any weirder is if San Marino 🇸🇲 win a match
"kepa keeps a clean sheet" That title says it all ahahahah
Jesus loves you and he’s coming soon Repent Today is the day of Salvation Romans 10:9 If you declare with your mouth,Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved, you may say where’s his coming he’s not coming soon but you have to realise he’s patient he don’t want anyone to perish if your not right with Jesus you wouldn’t want him to come yet
I think a better title for the video would be "Crossbar keeps a clean sheet for Kepa."
The problem in chelsea is the defenders 😂
The crossbar made more saves than kepa
Lucky Spain it should have been 3-0 to Portugal against the Spanish.
Thought it was Wolves vs Spain here
I am disappointed Kepa didn't pull off a few worldies. As a United fan and a human being I hope he does better when in La Liga and Internationals
Kepa and clean sheet in the title? No way
Good title tbh will make people click on video cuz of what an amazing rare thing they r experiencing
wait traore is spanish tf
Hit the bar twice and stared at the it like a deer in head lights twice. lol sky
I like this type of trolling from sky sports
1:16 wonderful ball
I needed to rub my eyes when I saw kepa cleans a clean sheet 🤣🤣🤣
Lol kepa only made 1 save and the crossbar got hit twice, that man couldn't even save my pdf files for school.
The original title was "kepa keeps a clean sheet for once"
More like the post kept Kepa the clean sheet
Kepa kept a clean sheet and still looked awful, how 😂😂
Even Ronaldo couldn't score past this clown
Unreal that he starts for spain after his recent form and stats
Portugal should have won, they got really unlucky, Ronaldo was doing bits tonight

1:15,what a play just unlucky
'woodwork helps kepa keep a clean sheet'
you know kepa is bad when the headline is 'kepa keeps clean sheet'
*The crossbar kept a cleen sheet
Renato was man of the match for me.
Love the title name thought it was clickbate at first😂
Didn't know Adama was Spanish
..and God said, 'trust me, you're getting a clean sheet today, Kepa!'
Correct title: Woodwork keeps a clean sheet
Think my nan could've kept a clean sheet this game and she's been dead for 4 years
More like the bar kept a clean sheet for Spain
The woodwork made more saves than kepa
1:20 was he celebrating 😂😂
Sky sports taking the piss with that title😂
"one shot on target" ..... KEPA KEEPS A CLEAN SHEET.
What a title
Woodwork got abused
How on earth did Portugal not win this game. Another great performance from Ronaldo the man is a machine
yeh he had a clean sheet but if they were on target they would have gone in
The title should be "goalposts keep a clean sheet"
Kepa clean sheet and he finally did!
It’s basically adama traore vs his club team mates
*the crossbar kept a clean sheet
kepa absolutely shegged by the title
Finally
Misleading video the bar gives Spain a clean sheet
oh you kept a clean sheet?    Do it in the prem then we will talk
New title: Kepa's woodwork keeps a clean sheet
The frame of the goal keeps clean sheet for Spain
spain had more shots, more shots on target and more possession but somehow they got lucky?
Shouldn’t have kept a clean sheet it should say😂
*Crossbar keeps a clean sheet*
Title says Kepa but video shows Rui Patricio making same number of saves
That crossbar's rattling like a quarantined smackhead
Man of the match..... KEPA!!!
A clean sheet from Kepa with Ronaldo playing up front? How is this possible
Long time since he kepa clean sheet...
Bookies Have Won On This One 😂
I personally think that the crossbar did more saves than kepa
Kepa honestly got lucky it should have been 3-0
Portugal played so much better
Spanish gk can only perform for their country lol
Traore vs teammates
Spanish gk can only perform for their country lol
Good game between Spain vs Wolves
with what saves lmao
Sky violated kepa 😂😂😂😂😂
The post deserves the motm award
they are clearly taking the piss with the title, his clean sheet had nothing to do with him
Kepa's luck worths more than his transfer
They put Kepa over de gea wtf
1:20 we jus gunna ignore the fact sanches started celebrating when he didn’t score😂
Dead game
It's funny that they actually have to have the title as kepa keeping a clean sheet🤣🤣
"Kepa keeps clean sheet!" "How many shots we're on target?" "2... if you count the one that hit the post and the other that hit the crossbar"
I like how the biggest meaning of this game is the fact kepa kept a clean sheet 😂
If anyone ever tells you that Ronaldo can’t pass, show them that pass
I'm shocked Kepa is even playing for Spain..
Take a screenshot of the title.  Its the only time that will happen
The wood work keeps clean sheet
Who else is amazed that Kepa even got an international call up on current form?
Shook
Sky sports are rude for that title 💀
*Crossbar keeps clean sheet for Spain**
title is funny
What a title lol
Not sure what’s more surprising, the villa score or the keeps clean sheet
"Woodwork keeps clean sheet for Spain" would be a more accurate title.
Ronaldo is finished cant even beat kepa messi is the goat
The crossbar saved more then kepa
The title is wrong.  The  crossbar got the clean sheet.
Kepa keeps a clean sheet. You mean the crossbar and Felix kept a clean sheet. Kepa just stood in the goal, standing there
i cant believe this game Portugal players lacking the will to win so much, and then the balls on the bar post.. just unreal Portugal could have won like 3 or 4 goals easily
Yo how much did Kepa pay for that invisible forcefield behind him 😱?
Kepa: Am i a joke to you?
Let's be honest, even De Gea could've kept a clean sheet in this game
ADAMA!!! I love seeing his explosive speed 🧨
Nice bit of clickbait there
I love how the title makes it seem like Kepa pulling saves out left and right and then they only showed 1 single save and then just misses and crossbar hits.
Kepa is so bad that when he does get a clean sheet he is all over the news for it
When the best thing about a game is that a keeper didnt concede a goal, it means that if he doesnt create a goal, its a rare situation, by definiton one of the best creaters of goals in modernday football
1:25 ref ran faster than carvalho  or just had more determination than him
Is this real or am I living a in a dream? Kepa has somehow kept a clean sheet against the reigning European Champions & CR7 whereas a couple of weeks ago he assisted Mane's second goal
Here you can see a very rare moment for the kepa species.
That pass 1:15 🤯
No Bruno no party
We were very well represented in this 🤣
How have Spain fallen so far in 10 years
Ronaldo's passing is an underrated attribute hes improved recently..
*Crossbar keeps clean sheet for Spain
Portugal almost has this one
Don’t get excited Chelsea fans, Portugal literally only had one shot on target
umm.. patricio also kept a clean sheet😂
That Cristiano pass was therapeutic
unlucky cr7
Woodwork saves kepa
*Crossbar keeps clean sheet for Spain
Lmao I think Renato Sanchez was celebrating a bit too early at 1:17
The title is very disrespectful. 😔
*I feel that you've disrespected Kepa quite a bit with the title, we all know he's the best goalkeeper in the prem thats why he's benching de gea, your saying this like he doesn't keep clean sheets often*
The title is even funnier considering Kepa, didn't even make a save in the whole match.
Why didn’t Bruno start he would’ve been the extra touch for portugal
That pass from Ronaldo tho 👌
Lmao, why is the title “Kepa keeps a clean sheet”, it should be Spain were saved by the crossbar twice but then you realise Kepa keeping a clean sheet is an extremely rare occurrence
The fact kepa made  one save just shows how bad he is
Chelsea fans right now.....     ?????????🤣
My goal in both halves bet went well
Ronaldo's shot power will be always there even when he is 40
Kepa can keep Ronaldo out but not bloody Mane? C'mon Kepa! Get your gloves together!
You know the games boring when the 1st highlight shown is right before the half
I mean if you want to summarise this as "Kepa keeps" you can...
lmao the woodwork did more work than kepa
I feel like sky sports are hinting something with that title
Ronaldo Couldn't score past karius now kepa jeez
Sky Sports trolling Kepa hard with that title.
Chip just dissed stormzy.. and im here watching highlights 🤦‍♂️
Can we just appreciate the ball from ronaldo to sanchez. And people still think ronaldo is arrogant and doesnt pass.
Crossbar was the one for the clean sheet
Can we just appreciate how ‘Kepa keeps a clean sheet’ can be used as a title 😂. That’s some level of goalkeeping.
I’m a Chelsea fan so I was stunned when I saw the title Portugal got unlucky
Kepa: :) Mendy:  How?
He's lost on that last corner where is he stood
Kepa well played
You know a keeper is bad if they kept a clean sheet and that is the title
Crossbar keeps a clean sheet for Spain*
Honestly, Spain needs to promote Riqui Puig.
Sky sports with lack of respect for kepa
CHANGE THE TITLE PLEASE. VERY DISRESPECTFUL TO OUR OWN KEPA
The fact that spain has to choose from de gea or kepa is like choosing Joelinton or Benteke
Ferran Fati Traore Riqui Busquets Thiago Alba Ramos Torres Carvajal De Gea  This squad would DOMINATE world.
0:26 that jump by Ronaldo honestly it’s freakish
I told you all Kepa is the best goalkeeper in the league, Who conceded 0 goals in GW4.....?
Correction - Woodwork keeps clean sheet for Spain
Man of the match kepa😂😂😂
The title sounds so boring when you actually pay attention "kepa keeps a clean sheet". Even the other keeper kept a clean sheet smh.
Is the title mocking Kepa???
They got us so hyped up because of the 3-3 in the WC then we got this.
Kepa.
Even the admin was shocked that Kepa kept a clean sheet, so shocked in fact that he put it in the title.
Kepa clean shee!? Wild
Kepa was always Chelsea's best keeper
That's a great story...
Done kepa dirty with the title
Nice to see the euros are starting again
You know a keeper is bad when the fact they keep a clean sheet is worthy of the title
