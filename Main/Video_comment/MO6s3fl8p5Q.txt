My Grandmother had 22 children, 3 sets of twins. All delivered at home, with the assistance of the local Midwife Mary Jane Morgan. Although 11 made it to fill birth but died in infancy. I became a midwife, qualified in 1980 in Liverpool. Worked in large Consultant led before working in a small midwife led unit. Things have changed in the Uk, midwives undertake a degree in midwifery now, standards have dropped, women who have a Caesars sections are discharged from hospital after 3 days, sometimes 2 days !
Beautiful. Dude, same thing happened with my 5th kiddo. The midwife had to lift my tummy every contraction to pull her to an up and down position...it worked. She was out within 15 minutes.

Hypnobirthing is not Christian
Just waiting for you to announce your 9th pregnancy🤭
You look so much like Scarlett Johansson
What a beautiful story!   My midwife recommends red raspberry leaf capsules for afterbirth pains, and it's always worked great for me for after all my babies! Never experienced bad afterbirth cramps. She suggests the same number of capsules as you've had babies, every 2-3 hours after you give birth for the first few days. I forgot to get red raspberry capsules before my last birth, and oh! the afterbirth pains were so painful! My mom ordered some for me right away, and after I started taking them, the difference was huge! I'm definitely going to remember that for next time.
So cute so sweet. The baby looks like it is feeding time.
I forgot to say that the baby and the mom are beautiful and blessed by God.
Thank you Lisa for sharing the magic of your life and your baby's birth. So much joy! I am in awe of you.
What is the name of the Christian hypnobirthing app you used?
So true it’s the intensity of birth which makes us anxious. It’s like nothing else in life.
Yes, it was very encouraging! You are my go to for encouragement when I’m feeling anxious about my upcoming birth.
I'm 33 weeks with my fifth baby, and your birth stories have been an awesome encouragement to me through the years. I love the plan to just live life and not think about labor in order not get psyched out. I can get so afraid of the intensity of birth, but Gods been reminding me through this pregnancy "do not be afraid," every time I begin to feel fear again. He is so faithful  🙏
I too did the Bradley method!
What the process for the newborn testing after a home birth? (Ex: circumcision, jaundice, hearing, etc)
Im due this July with our first, and have been a little worried about the actual birth and all the unknowns of it. I’ve been going through and watching your birth stories and it’s really helped me to be calm and not worry about what going to happen! My mom is a midwife and hopefully will be the one to help me deliver the baby. I’m almost excited to go through this experience the closer we get. Is that weird? Probably😂  Thank you for sharing your story and showing how positive it can be even when things don’t go to plan❤
I wonder what your internal reasons are of wanting to have 8 children. That are soooo many.
What was this Hypnobirthing app?
You videos are deeply soothing and inspiring.  Thank you for sharing and teaching. You have such a bright and positive influence.   Many blessings to you and your family.   J
put your phone on air plane mode around your baby - in 20 years you are going to wish you did this - it is equivalent to seeing a mother nursing and smoking a cigarette in the 1920's they had no clue how bad it was - radiation is the same...kepp that phone away from your childrens growing bodies.
Congratulations, God has truly blessed you and your family.  What a beautiful baby!!
I just found your page today and am feeling so much better after listening to your last two birth stories. I’m due April 8th and plan to give birth at a birth center. Listening to the Christian Birth App and Happy Home Birth podcast like you mentioned has been helping too. You help me to switch my mind from fear to empowerment. Thank you and congratulations on your beautiful newest member of your family. ❤
What is the instagram handle of Leslie you spoke about?
you are sensational!
40 weeks pregnant and this video was just what I needed!
So this is my second time watching your story. I am at my due date today and I had my last a week early. To say I've been disappointed this week is a major understatement. I really thought I was going into labor a week ago and even experienced some padromal labor on the 39week mark, but it peetered out. I am not anxious about the birth but just getting pretty depressed and if I get to 41weeks the Dr will want to do an induction. I'm just really dreading having to wait another whole week or week and a half. So I came back here to see you because I know you had a lot of false starts. Thank you for the encouraging video. I don't know who to talk to because no one around me understands how this feels. Very disappointing and depressing and embarrassing since I told everyone it would be the 10th.  Anyway, thank you for sharing your story.
Thank you for sharing and all your wonderful content! Do you have any content on your home birthing supplies? Set up?
Congratulations. My after birth pains were very painful. I'm a mom of 6.
What was the christian hypnobirthing app called? Congratulations. ❤
Whoa! I have ONE! just one lol. I had a hospital birth. And had placenta plasia so was resigned to a caesarian birth. Long story short , the placenta can right itself along the way, so, i requested a late term ultrasound 2 weeks before the due date. The placenta was in a safe position and my daughter came 10 days early. I had 4 days to thnk about a natural birth. When i went into labour i didnt even realise it was labour. 😂 when my water broke at home, i was so unprepared i thought i just needed to pee! By the time i realised what was going on it was so close to too late. I wound up making it to the hospital,  just, and had a completely natural birth. No drugs, no dramas, some stitches, no problems breastfeeding. Pretty perfect. Im convinced it was because i had no preconceptions about birth. Didnt have to listen to anyones horror stories and did not read a single book. Shes 13 now and im 43, she was a perfect baby, a fantastic kid and now an amazing young women. Despite all that , one has always been it for me. I dont know how you ladies do it with  these large families! Superwomen for sure!
I’ve only had three births and my third birth had prodromal labor for three weeks so I feel your struggle. It was also the only birth where I had a lot of bleeding and needed the pitocin shot.
Our babies have the same birthday!! July 25th 2023! Four months late but congratulations mama ❤
Beautiful birth story , beautiful baby , and he was so alert and opened his eyes !!!
SHE LOOKS AMAZING FOR HAVING 8 CHILDREN MY GOODNESS 🤍
Gross and self-indulgent.
Beautiful story.   My niece used the Bradley method with #3 child.  Went through so easily and peacefully.  I had 2 c-sections 😢.  It’s nice to hear a different version birth.   Thanks.
I would love to try a homebirth, but my first born caused a cervical laceration which hemorrhaged severely...if i had tried a homebirth to start, I wouldn't have survived. It was very intense..I don't think homebirth is for me.
Regarding afterbirth pains from a mom of six : my midwife taught me to massage the uterus prior to nursing each time (helps tremendously, I had never heard that one before and I normally take after ease tincture religiously but wasn't able to the first six hours as my placenta came late so they wanted me to take no relaxation herbals etc. 👍 something else to try if you end up with a baby #9
Czy rodziłaś z położną czy sama?  Send greetings from Poland ❤
Its like you wear a cape all day long right
I am a mother of two grown up children. The first born I did in a hospital, that time a didn't know much about homebirth. My second child I got at home, it was a nice experience  and I am thankful  this. Unfortunately I got enough press to work outside the house. Me personally I would have prefer a calm life with at least 4 children. Thank you for your channel Many greetings from Germany
Have you had all your babies at home?  If so, How were the first 2 home births?
Great News, Congratulations.
What was the name of the app she talked about?
No offense at all but I can't watch this video, Your last home birth video convinced me to have baby number 3 and he is next to me now at 4months old. Hahahahahaha I willhave another if I watch this video haha
Congratulations on another beautiful baby!
Congratulations!♥️💐👍🏻☘️💚This is beautiful baby!❤❤❤❤❤❤
I think I've watched this three times now. I'm in the home stretch with baby 5, and I always thrive on birth stories at this point. 😂  This is also my first time having prodromal labor. I had serious contractions for several hours last night that fizzled out by around 8 this morning. And now I'm having contractions again. I'm two days from my due date and wondering if I'll go early for the first time or if this will keep happening. Thanks for the encouragement and positivity! I'll be trying Bradley again this time, too. Every time I hope to make my labor better and more enjoyable than the last time, so I'm trying not to get worked up over this prodromal junk. God bless you as your raise your beautiful family!
Congratulations
I had prodromal labor with both of my babies. They start at about 36 weeks and continue until I have the baby. First one landed me in the hospital 3 times before I actually had him. (26 hour labor) 2nd one I just figured it was nothing. I’d contract for hours even getting painful enough I’d throw up. Then the day I go into labor I didn’t realize I was actually going to have her until my water broke figuring it was the same situation. Four hours later there she was. No one ever talks about that. It’s always Braxton Hicks.  These are not that!
💙
So you had 8 babies from your body?? 😊Because I want to too lol i have 3 now.
Dear Reader, “No one can come to Me unless the Father who has sent Me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day… Truly, truly I say to you, whoever believes in Me has eternal life. I am the bread of life.” John 6:44, 47-48 “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me… He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me… Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” John 14:6, 21, & 27 Jesus loves you so much and is the only way to eternal life, truth, and perfect love. He loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life. All you have to do is believe in your heart, call upon Him, and ask Him to come into your heart and life for your life to change from darkness, death, and defeat, to victory and light and true life. GOD BLESS you and Jesus loves you. ❤️❤️❤️
So nice
Prodromal labor will really mess with you. It's as painful as real labor and you get in the headspace for meeting your baby today and then nothing. Nothing happens. It all just stops. Anyone who says prodromal labor and braxton hicks is the same because they are both "false labor" has clearly not experienced it.
Victor Isaiah! Beautiful!!! ❤ ya sis, getting ready to become a Grammy ANY DAY😊 to our first!!! We’ll be in KC any day now, ❤ from you St. LU sis, Kristy 😃🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Very informative!
I had my first second and fifth babies at home 1990/91 and 2003. Eheb I heard people talking about birthing I tried to explain how I went about my days as normal during labour, stopping for a contraction and moving on , they would be perplexed. . But it meant you weren’t dwelling in a medical style birth , it was a normal part of your life. Only at the end did I lie down, kneel down  and get ready to have the baby. It’s so lovely abd I’m happy when other mothers experience this too. Congratulations and welcome to victor.
My last baby had the cord wrapped tightly around his neck and we almost lost him at birth. Thankfully I had a Dr’s appt that day and he knew something was wrong and I was taken by ambulance to the hospital. His heart stopped at the hospital and I had a emergency c section without anesthesia so I felt when I was cut. My precious boy was not breathing for almost 2 minutes. Thankfully he was brought back and he’s completely normal no brain damage. I think it depends how tightly the cord is wrapped around baby’s neck as to if it is dangerous or not. Needless to say every time I look at my son I’m reminded he’s a miracle❤
This is how God meant it to be! No fear of babies and childbirth.  Ive had 6, 2 natural and 4 sections. We did raw milk formula with our last two due to health issues with me. Wish i had known this way, keep encouraging other mamas! It's what we were naturally built for. No fear! Thanks for your channel. Its my all time favorite.
I’ve had 7 homebirths with no issues, everything went beautifully with 7 healthy/happy babies as a result. I can defiantly say the last two were the most “difficult” because of exactly what Lisa described as almost an unfounded fear and anxiety with every contraction. The only thing I attribute it to is my difference in age. We definitely change as we get older and things we used to be able to handle with ease become a challenge, both mentally and physically! Thanks for sharing your birth story, Lisa! 💕
A strong woman 😢❤❤ i love you mother ❤❤❤ love you so much ❤❤❤
When you say pain-free birth are you being serious? Like it just felt intense but not necessarily painful?
I'm late to comment, but want to finally say congratulations are you newest addition! Thank you for sharing your birth stories. I had my 5th in April (also had to use the Miles Circuit!) and watched all your birth stories before my due date as inspiration. :)
I had prodromal labor for my 1st and my labor was only 4 hours
We had #4 end of April 😊 it was a free birth and so wonderful! #3 was born during the day and the siblings were there and it was so amazing and I wanted the same for this. But this time it started picking up more in the evening after a couple weeks of prodromal waves and at night when it was SO intense I was kinda glad the other kids weren’t around. I got out of bed at 1am and baby (first girl 🥰) was born at 3.37 am.  I fell asleep during transition which I had no idea it was but my husband told me I was fully open 😂 I couldn’t believe it was so close already. Then I got in the pool like 15 mins before she was born. No pain! It’s just so amazing, can’t wait to do it again hopefully some day 😍🥰  Me and hubby and baby sat on the couch after and just said to each other ‘did we just have a baby in our living room’. Just us two. So special.  If we’re blessed with another one I’m thinking I want the sibling there, but we’ll see!
Congratulations on a healthy and safe delivery! Your confidence is beautiful to see.
3 to go for soccer team.
So I heard that you could shiver after birth, did you experienced that too?
Wow, #8. Why does anyone want to have so many kids? Don't hate, just genuinely curious. Food, school, clothing, college, yada, yada. how does one even afford that many kids.
Your birth stories are so moving! <3 You make it look easy, haha. Glad you are both in good health. Victor is absolute perfection. I LOVE his name! You of course always look as beautiful as ever. Thanks for sharing all the details. Super happy for you all!
Love the Bradley method, but I love the water too! My sister had all 6 of her babies at home before I started. She told me "it's called labor because it's just a lot of really hard work". My Mother was nervous for me, and she kept saying, "You do realize pain is involved, right?" To which I would reply, "well Rachel said it's just a lot of hard work." After laboring at home, pushing for 3 hours, transferring to the hospital (which took forever because we were in an ice storm, Christmas day, and had to wait on a tree to be removed from the driveway), pushing for several more hours, finally getting the episiotomy I had asked for, he was finally born! I  turned and looked at my precious Mother and said, " Rachel was right, it was just a lot of hard work!" I literally felt no pain till after. We won't talk about after! 😂 4 additional all natural births later, the only pain I ever felt was the ring of fire, which I didn't even feel on the first baby. This always got me so excited because I knew it was almost over! ❤ Loved your story!
Where are your other children while you create your videos?
I think we have the same bed!!!❤️
Very nice to finally see who was in your belly all that time. 😊❤
That’s a big ole farm boy! ❤ Look at all that hair! Ahhh! He’s so precious. I have a 7 month old and he’s my 4th and I just miss those newborn days so much. Congratulations on your healthy birth and precious baby ❤
Congratulations he's precious 🎉
Congratulations! He is absolutely precious! God is always so faithful!
Congratulations ❤ now I have a real question: would you consider doing a video on parenting tips ( particularly early years)?
Congratulations Lisa! I loved your story! May the Lord bless and protect this child and your family. If you don’t mind, would you please share the playlist you listened to during this birth?
Can you share a link to the Christian hypnobirthing tracks you listened to? Thanks for sharing your birth stories- watching them inspired me to have my own home birth with my second baby ❤
Is it possible to get baby fever whilst already pregnant? Lol hope my 5th labor and delivery will be like yours.
Proud of you momma! Welcome Victor!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg he is so precious ❤
Dear ones, thank you for sharing. Welcome to the light, baby boy.
Congratulations! You are such an inspiration.  You are a beautiful mother and Victor is a beautiful baby. God bless you and your family. We sorely need more families like yours. Massive respect. ❤❤❤❤❤
Congratulations he is beautiful ❤️
I have a question. My first birth was a hospital birth that didn't go well, didn't progress and had to go on picoden, 16 hours and bad tears, would I be able to go on and have a home birth like this with my other children or is a bad first birth experience indicative that none will be like this and all will be similar to the first?
So happy to hear the good news! Home birth is the best. I just uploaded my own positive home birth stories on my channel as well :)
Is it too personal to ask how old you are?:) you look great! Im shocked you are a mama of 8
Congrats!! I also get some intense prodromal labor. With my fifth, my first contraction was 10 mins from my 2nd, then the rest were 2-3 mins apart max for a few before being on top of each other. 😂 So I was pushing an hour after my first contraction. Doctor didn’t even make it. Lucky it takes the pain away for you! I do Bradley, hypnobirthing. Literally everything, but my births are still quite painful, but I have a very small pelvis that my babies always get stuck on. So obviously so many factors can make it impossible for some women, but it makes it at least manageable enough to get through, as long as it is fast. 😂 I’m fine up until transition and then bam. 😅 My second youngest was born pretty quickly and then this last one 1 1/2 hours after first contraction so I’m a bit nervous how fast next labors will be. 😳
Hi, I am a Mom of adopted twin daughters, each entering their 3rd year of college.  Our girls are pure gift and I am grateful, everyday, for them! I love your sharing of your birth experiences. Especially, the one in the van! Oh, my, you are a very strong, brave woman. You family is beautiful! And so are you! I always wondered, how can I help my girls when they become mothers? After having a total hysterectomy at the age of 26, due to severe endometriosis, I can identify more with my friends mother's menopause journeys, than my peers pregnancy and birth stories.  Now? You have opened your home and your heart and I have a little insight. Thank you! God bless you! Kim
Congratulations
He is precious.  My fifth birth was pain free.
You are SUPER MOM 👩 ❤
I LOVED The Bradley Method! I used it, my daughter used it with her babies, 3 babies all fast labors with no drugs!
Thank you, God continue to bless you and your family.
I've heard stories many years ago and I am a old woman. Women Would go in  labor and they  go in Labor.  If that meant pushing a plow! Some women back in did have  Natural  birth. .
Wow, so interesting that I went through similar things with my experience in pregnancy with my 8th.. with anticipation and anxiety and everything you said but I didn't have podromal labor. Even though all my other 7 births had none of that. God bless you sister in Jesus!
Congrats! May God bless your new baby and your family.
Congratulations! Love how you are sharing your journey as a mother. God Bless!
Congratulations! I’ve had 3 home births and they were the best decisions we ever made. It makes me happy to hear that even with your 8th baby you still have that anxiety/fear/uncertainty… when I was about to go into labor with my 2nd I was like, wow I’m so nervous and then the other part of my mind was like “why in the world are you nervous? You’ve done this before” But really, that’s why moms can have multiple babies…we have such amnesia of all the gory details and feelings, we’re just like, yup let’s have another one! 😂😂
What a little CUTIE PIE
8 wow
Amazing! Could you share which hypnobirth  app you used?
I finally realized after baby number 3 that I should stop having expectations of what labor will be like and that I still won’t know when I’m actually in labor 😂. I just had my 5th and it’s so funny how hard it is to know when you’re actually in labor and when it’s time to call the midwife. I’ve experienced prodromal labor really badly with one of my babies and it just throws everything off. So glad everything went smoothly; if I have another baby you given me some things to work on. I typically have extremely painful labors and with my last two babies I had so much fear leading up to their births. . . I’m sure that didn’t help.
Yea, I got to finish watching....You and your family are so,so blessed. Thank-you for sharing it all with us💓
Beautiful baby! Congratulations! And thank you for sharing your story. Too many people share the scary side of labor. It's refreshing to hear a positive experience. God bless you and yours.
You amaze me.....your understanding of giving birth is really great to listen to. I'm bummed I have to go...I hope to catch the rest of your birth story .......😁💓
I had excessive bleeding after my 4th. One thing to be careful about......my midwife told me I had a superficial tear that would heal naturally. It didn't. I went to see my obgyn 2 years after the birth bc I had a problem with bowel incontinence that just never got better. I found out I had a severe 4th degree tear. My Dr. Referred me to a specialist. I had a sphincteroplasty to repair the muscles but developed a fistula. I ended up with an ileostomy and a grisulus muscle flap surgery. Once that all healed I was able to have the ileostomy reversed and I'm mostly back to normal. If you find yourself struggling with incontinence please see a doctor asap. I don't think midwives are trained in recognizing tears. I think they should be more informed and trained in how to fix them because after you have a home birth your OBGYN is pretty hands-off most likely due to malpractice suits. Fortunately, my obgyn referred me to a surgeon who was a wonderful Christian women and took great care of me.
Absolutely stunning baby! And Mama!❤
This is a beautiful birth story! Great Job Momma!   I am so thankful to have all 5 of mine at home. 4 out of my 5 births I dilated way ahead of time resulting in a very fast deliveries. My fasted being 47 mins counting from the first noted contraction.   I never knew the name of the labor you mentioned! I guess that’s what I had as well, since my body prepared so much ahead of time with minimal pain.   Thank you for sharing your story and congratulations!

Thank you for sharing what birth is meant to be and change what movies and TV have portrayed incorrectly.  Women take back your power and in turn give it to your babies.
This part (around 24:00) was really helpful for me to hear (I'm 36 weeks pregnant as of tomorrow): There are tons of hormones present during active labor that help you and carry you through the most intense parts of the process, but while you're in early labor, that cascade of hormones isn't there to help you, so it's important to be mindful of that and remember that when you're just THINKING about/ANTICIPATING active labor, but still in the early stages of labor, you don't have those hormones to support you, so what you're feeling then is not an accurate assessment of how you're going to feel when the intensity of active labor is actually under way. Thank you for sharing!
He is BEAUTIFUL! Welcome to the world little one. God Bless you all!
I love this! This is what my second birth was! Prodromal labor for 2 weeks so I finally went to the chiropractor and got a membrane sweep because I was so anxious! Had the baby 6 hrs later 🤣 and baby was out in 3 hrs.
What an amazing birth story.  The LORD has a special blessing for those who let Him determine the size of their family.
Hes gorgeous ❤
This is exactly how I labor. Can be so frustrating. Last two babies came withing 45 minutes after four or so nights in prodromal labor. It's hard to know when to have the midwives come.
This is so interesting! I just had my 8th baby recently and had similar contractions, when it was time to push my contractions were so spread out, I remember asking the midwife why there was so much time between contractions because I just wanted to finish pushing and get him out.  Never had them that spread apart at the end
Can Victor breath under the grey cover?
u r glowing ..:) sending prayers and love for ur precious family
Congratulations! What a blessing to have eight children. ❤
Congratulations ❤️
He isn’t red, is this because he was born at home?
Congrats Lisa! Victor is beautiful! What is the name of the app you used for the hypnobirthing?
Congratulations Lisa and family! He is beautiful! ❤
I’m in awe of all you do!! You inspire me but I am not together at all. I would love some more children but I’m struggling with how to give special time to my 4 children now.    How do you an experienced mom of 8 make time for all the kids? I have so much guilt I’m not giving them all what they need or playing enough with them.
Congratulations to you and your family!! Victor is so beautiful!
You are phenomenal!  Awesome job mama!
I enjoyed watching your birth story! Such good advice for those thinking of doing home birth and gives me ideas to share with my daughter who wants to do a home birth when they have their first child.  Congratulations on a beautiful baby boy!❤
Congratulations to your family. Wishing you all new adventures
Beautiful birth story!  We just had our 5th- our second emergency c section (with a Vbac between)… my first pregnancy with the pre labor.. it was lovely listening to your story and gives myself a little more hope if we are blessed with another baby that perhaps it won’t end in a c section. ❤ congratulations!
Such a blessing ❤
Organic raspberry leaf tea works great for cramps☺️
Thank you for sharing your beautiful birth story. I became nostalgic thinking that I would never be able to go through labor again. I enjoy my five babies births. I have grown grandchildren, and yet, I had a moment of longing. Blessing to you and your family. (hugs).
Congratulations 🎉 🎊 ❤
Love your videos, so activating! Question: would you have preferred your children near you or even next to you (those who happen to be awake, or interested in being near) while giving birth, or not at all? Or does this oppose the bradley method’s foundation of total inner relaxation? Preparing for homebirth no 3 here, with older children probably present in or near the house.
Christian hypnobirth app is amazing. I started practicing it nightly at 32 weeks and had a blissful birth. My husband has videos of me smiling through very intense contractions.
Just so adorable
Each time you have a baby you shine so much,  it's literally like you've been given an angel and you're in awe. Congratulations 🎉❤
Congrats on handsome Victor and another successful home birth labor! To God be the glory.  🥰
I had 6 at home and 7th in hospital because she was breech. She was born foot first in a very easy, peaceful labor. I could have had a homebirth but midwives in our area aren't allowed to deliver breech pregnancies at home.
I have a question, are you part of the QUIVERFUL movement?
You are a wonder woman
Congratulations! He is absolutely precious 🥰 I’m expecting baby #8 as well ☺️
Love it
All 4 of my labors have been at night! It does make it much more difficult. But I am expecting my 5th now and am getting excited about it while watching your video.
How old are you? I’m deciding whether to have a 5th. I had a natural, unassisted birth last time. It was my 1st going without an epidural and I was so proud of myself. But I’m terrified to have another because that process of pain. My labors are always around 24 hours long.
Congrats Lisa and family! Thank you for sharing. What a blessing, welcome Victor.
You look so good! Pregnant with baby number 6 and I’m due next month planning my 4th home birth. This makes me look forward to it so much! Lots of wisdom. So much of it is a mind game up until labor. I keep telling myself I’m going to 42 weeks plus and hopefully will be pleasantly surprised haha
Congratulations on another beautiful life.
Congrats!! Victor is so perfect! Can you do a video about your garden and what herbs you are growing
BEAUTIFUL! Thank you for sharing your journey with us ❤❤
You're worse than an un‐spayed dog.
Chamomille tea is great for menstrual cramps, after labor cramps, and all stomach cramps.
Congratulations 🥳 love hearing birth stories! My 2nd, 3rd & 4th all had prodromal labour and it was so hard to explain to people.  I had 2 weeks of prodromal with my 2nd baby… 8 days with #3… and a full 5 weeks with baby #4 😅  But it definitely led to shorter births for me. My first was 17hrs long. Baby 2 was one hour. Baby 3 was 50 minutes. And baby 4 was 2hr 14min.  The longer birth was an answer to prayer because I spent my whole pregnancy praying for it to be longer so my midwife could be here 😂
Congratulations! He is adorable!💙
What’s the name of the app you used with the scriptures and everything else?
Thanks for sharing. Glad it all went well for you :)  Ive had four births (in hospital) thinking about another... as my daughter keeps asking me for another sibling.
You are amazing 👏🏻 ❤️ love big families.
Congratulations on your handsome boy, Victor!! 🤍 As a new mom myself, I really enjoyed watching your video and having the chance to hear your story.
I told you a few days ago how I yearned for a little one again.Well my son and daughter in law just told us today they are expecting she’s just 10 weeks so we are so excited 😅Hope all is well 😊 God is Great!!!’
Thanks for the story. I’m glad I’m not the only one who feels that way “dreading the transition and the delivery” during labor. That is all I’m thinking about during labor. I get so anxious about it. I want to try to do something different this time. Maybe Hypnobirthing? I’m 38 weeks now. So nervous.
OMGoodness Lisa.  Today I had a very sweet mom in my salon, Kelly P.  Who told me that you are a friend of yours.  How mind blowing.  I have been following you for about a year.  I had no idea you live close to me.  So crazy how it even came up. I just love knowing such precious young women are cultivating such a positive presence in our community!  God bless you sweetie.
Congratulations on you beautiful baby boy Victor. Also thank you for answering my questions as to what kitchen counter top you have, I had lost your answer and could not reply with a thank you. I am new to your channel,  but I am in awe at all that you can do so well. I am appreciative to have found your channel. God Bless you and your new little boy and rest of family!🍃🌹🍃
I loved your birth story. So many similarities to my last birth with our 6th baby. I had predromal labor for a week with him. My husband worked 3rd.shift so each night it was a game  should I send him to work or not. Because of all the predromal labor my labor was quick. My midwife made it with 5 minutes to spare. At one point my sister who told me I should call the midwife because she noticed my contractions were 5 minutes apart. I called but honestly didnt think I would be having a baby in an hour. 😂 I was still in the kitchen drinking some tea and enjoying some conversation. There wasnt really any pain. Just some uncomfortable cramping. I never even noticed I was going though transition. I started to feel like I had to push. One push and my water broke. And in one push he was born.
You amaze me with every video! You're such an inspiration. Congratulations on your beautiful baby Victor.
Congratulations!
Congrats to all and welcome baby! 🎉
hey do your own apron line with your girls
Well he is just beautiful! Would love to hear how you chose all your kids names. We had a HARD time choosing.
Lovely ❤❤❤
Lovely video, even though I am having no more it’s still lovely to watch. When you have contractions for a long time by the time you deliver your uterus gets ‘tired’ so doesn’t really do its job to stop the bleeding. I lost 2.7 litres after 3 days of contractions. Someone was looking after me that day…
Congratulations 🎉❤. Victor is precious. Rest and enjoy your sweet baby and family. ❤️🙏❤️
Congratulations to you and your family!  I loved listening to your story.   I have had two hospital births and then now have had two homebirths.  It is so much more peaceful at home!
Beautiful baby boy good job well done
Amazing story ! But who  is watching your 7 other kids  , it is so quiet in the home.
Congrats!
Thank you for sharing! Your story reminds me of my last labor (baby #6). ❤ I had prodromal labor for the whole last month of pregnancy, and I agree. It’s for the birds! Just curious how old you are? I was 34 when I had mine, so I’m curious if age + number of births factor in.
Homebirths hold such a special place in my heart! ❤ I was blessed to be able to have all five of mine at home and it’s just WONDERFUL! Been looking forward to this…love hearing you talk through your experiences! 😊
Congratulations on your new baby! Amazing to hear the story.
Congratulations! My great grandmother had 2 daughters and for 5 years didn’t have another child. They got teased a lot. Then she had my grandfather and over her next ten years produced another boy every year. She always praised God that he sent her two helpers ahead.
Congratulations and thank you so so much for sharing your birth story with us. I’m expected to give birth to my third by or around 8/12 and I can relate so much to experiencing different symptoms than with my other two labors. This will be my first homebirth. The first two were at my midwife’s birth center. I embrace all of your positive energy and hope I too will experience a positive birth!!
I cant  imagine.  Get me to the hospital!!
❤❤
U r soo amazing..I Your control ,confidence and the knowledge u have is so impressive..I wish I had known about those methods back in the 70s when I had mine..I would have loved to have mine at home..u always have beautiful babies and victor is no diff..and the hair!!!.Congrats to u and your husband!!How many kids do u guys plan to have?..
Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy! Can you please share the christian hipno birthing track you were talking about?
Congratulations! What a head of hair! He is too cute! Blessings on all of you!💕
CONGRATULATIONS……he’s just beautiful!!!  💙
Ooo my god i m soooo happyyy sooo happy. Congradulations... ❤
Congratulations! Welcome baby Victor.
So many good things to think about.  He is precious .   No fear.  You will be equipped when it is time for labor.  .thank you for sharing
I’m a nurse and a mom, I will without doubt say that the healthcare system intervenes and interferes way too much and way too often !!! Birth is a natural process and we need to re learn the natural process !!! Women like you have so much to teach….thank you ! Blessings and congratulations 💙
Lisa, congratulations! God bless you and your family! And thank you for your birth story – I am at the beggining of my pregnancy, but apparently I am just starting to think about birth. And with the cord – I had the same with my second baby – cord around neck, very irregular contractions to the end (and very rare when laying down/in one position in the bath and very, very close when moving or staying up). I think it was because  of cord – that baby was sending stress hormones, so cotractions was irregular, but I have no clue with position. Anyway – i am very happy for you!
Congratulations this is so beautiful
amazing and encouraging! congratulations on the beautiful baby boy
Congrats on your new addition!
I admire you so much, you are literal goals 😭❤❤❤
What a beautiful name.
What a beautiful baby.
Beautiful!! Congratulations and God Bless❤
Congratulations!🎈🥳🎉 A true miracle of birth!❤ He is a beautiful baby boy! Healthy w/ all ur home cooking 🥰💋🫶🏻
Congratulations on the birth of your beautiful little boy!
Congratulations
I’m so happy for you!!!! Home births are THE BEST, and I just wish everyone could know how beautiful and natural and freeing and peaceful and gentle birth could be. It breaks my heart that so many women are scared into traditional western medicine births and then often bullied out of the birth they want when they aren’t at home. God bless you all!  P.S. I’ve only had one home birth, after 2 hospital births. I wish so much in had known with my first two. 😢
Oh my gosh, the sweet coos and cuddles!  So glad  everything went well!  ❤
Congratulations,  what a beautiful birth story, and such a adorable baby boy! 👶
Congratulations he is perfect
Congratulations!! This birth story brings back so many sweet memories from our homebirth days.❤️
Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy!  8 is a lot, lol!  When I was growing up in the 70s there was a t.v. show that I loved called "Eight is Enough!" I was an only child so I loved this show.  Now I'm an old grandma of 11 and love your show!  Many more blessings to you and your family!
Beautiful ❤
Congratulations Lisa! I really enjoyed listening to this and learning your coping strategies. I am due with my second this fall. Doing a homebirth again, but praying for the peace you have described as I did not experience that with my first. Reading the Bradley method this time though🤞
Congrats on the new addition, I’m glad everything worked out for your family.
you look stunning! congratulations on your beautiful new baby boy!
Congratulations! He’s precious! 💙
A massive congratulations on baby number 8💪🥰 He is so sweet looking all-around the place ❤️
The beautiful head of hair on Baby Victor tho!! Welcome to the world, Little One <3
Beautiful baby !!!
Congratulations!!! Praise avid for another safe delivery. Welcome Victor. Expecting #7 at Christmas. ❤  LISA.. Did you make your green block print pillow shams? Adorable!
Praise God...and CONGRATULATIONS to you all! Always appreciate you sharing your philosophies and birth stories=)
Congratulations Lisa ❤
Congratulations! I was wondering what was the name of the app you downloaded for hypnobirthing? Thank you!
Little Victor is so sweet! I love all his hair. 🥰 This was such a lovely, peaceful birth story. I pray I can have a home birth like this one day. Thank you for sharing!
Congratulations! You make me want to have another baby but my last one is almost done with HS and deep down I don’t really want to start over lol.
Yay! Baby video; my favourite video series on your channel. Praise the LORD
Happy birthday Victor!
Thank you so much for sharing your birth experience! Congratulations! I think it is very important to show people that birth can be so different than the one typically shown in movies. I also had my daughter at home 3 years ago and it was an amazing experience!
Congratulations ❤
Congratulations, Lisa! Thank you for sharing your birth story with us!
I’m so happy I watched your birth stories! Im 20 and had my first recently and your “denial method” was at the back of my mind. I honestly convinced myself it wasn’t real labor and just went about my day out and about. Then when my water broke  and the really wild contractions started I lost it and went into full primal mode lol but it was only an hour and a half and then he was here :) my whole family was really impressed that i stayed calm all day (as I am an anxious person) and managed to reach 10cm without medication :) I really think it helped so, thanks for sharing!
Loved listening to your birth story ❤ Congratulations 🎉 That prodromal labor can really play on me mentally. I had it with my 7th & 8th, and now at 37 weeks with my 9th I am getting it 😅 My 8th came before the midwife arrived, so I am trying to navigate when to call the midwife this time around. Last time I managed the pain so well that when it got intense to where I did call the midwife, it was too late and that pressure dropped quickly and out came the babe 😂
Congratulations!!! I love your birth stories 😀 he is precious!!
Congratulations ❤️ he is perfect
Thank you Lord for answered prayers, daytime labor and a beautiful healthy baby and mom!
Congratulations to you and your family! He is beautiful!
I used the distraction method 43 years ago although I didn’t know that’s what it was🤣  We moved  into another house and was so busy with that I didn’t realize I was in labor until we finished. Then I realized I better get to the hospital. I had my 2nd child in 20 minutes. So glad everything went well with you and you have another beautiful baby❤️
Congratulations! 🎉 He is beautiful:)
Beautiful baby! Congratulations!
I love your channel but I can’t amagion haveing that many kids with the way the world is today.  Surely your body is telling u it’s tired of having babies. Congratulations on your baby boy
Congratulations with this precious new addition to your family!
Welcome to the world  Victor Isiah!    Congratulations Lisa and family!  I loved hearing your home birth story!
Congratulations on Vistor Isiah. Gorgeous.
Congratulations Lisa. He's gorgeous.
My 4 year old son is a Victor the 3rd. Best name to have. Bless your family ❤
Welcome to the world victor.
Congratulations! Thank you for sharing your beautiful birth story. I watched your others before I had my last child and was so inspired and uplifted before my own peaceful, natural birth. Love you to and your family!
thanks for your advice! your Victor is so cute !  may his life flourish in joy❤thank Lord🙏
Congratulations!!! He is adorable!!!
I loved listening to your last birth story, and now this one . Our second baby will be here in early February and there are Sooo many things I want to change about the labor/birth experience this time. You are encouraging and I will definitely be looking into the bradley method!  God bless you and baby Victor ❤
Congratulations to you and Victor. It was another perfectly unique birth story. ❤
Blessings and Smiles
Congratulations!  Victor is adoreable!  Get plenty of rest and take care of yourself!  We will be waiting and watching!!!
VICTOR 🤗
You need afterease tincture! Game changer!
How / where is your hubby involved during the deep relaxing and labor?
Your stories are very encouraging! Thank you for sharing. For my first birth I had kept so much in-mind in terms of trying to relax etc. but unfortunately I ended up with what they call a precipitous birth that literally caught me so off guard and was so intense right out of the gate that the birth became extremely chaotic and traumatic for me. If you know anything about precipitous births I’m interested in hearing about it but I’m hoping to never experience that again 😅
You are incredible lady!!! Wow. really. you INSPIRE me!!
So happy for such a positive birth. Congratulations to the whole family!
You are amazing!❤
Congratulations on the birth of your precious baby boy! Glad that you both are doing well! 👣
Its such a nice kitchen. So well planned. I love the Ikea drawers.
I had my 7th baby at home and a few days before he was born, I was 7cm! Crazy! The next day I had my midwife come and break my water. My labor was 45 min. Talk about a whirlwind.
Thanks for sharing very encouraging birth story ❤
Congratulations! Can you share the visualization/scripture podcast that you mentioned you were listening to?
Congratulations lady!!!  Happy for you all
Welcome to the world Victor!  Job well done Lisa. So happy for all of you. Babies are a blessing!!!
Congrats Lisa & Family🥰
I just had my second son at home Monday morning, and it’s story is soo similar to yours
I had that false labor with my second baby a few times and then when i finally went into real labor it was 4 hours from start to finish! 😂 my midwife didnt make it. Which makes me feel like this time around i might just do it myself, but we'll see. I planned on a water birth. It took so long to fill up the tub that i actually was only in it for abour 15 minutes before my baby came out.  being in the water felt sooo amazing!! I did zero pushing and had no tears! I love hearing all your birth stories! ❤ your babies are all so adorable!
Congrats on a beautiful and healthy baby!
Congratulations 🎉 God bless your beautiful growing family 🙏🏻🩵💙
welcome to the world, victor!
Lisa you are my inspiration, thank you!
Congratulations! He's beautiful!
Thank you for sharing. Such a blessing. The bad after pains are due to the pitocin. Hope they feel better soon:)
Thank you SO much for sharing!! I loved all of this! Great job , mama!!!! Blessings!
You’re amazing!! Congrats!! Had my 2 babies at home… love to hear these kinds of stories ❤
Congratulations 🎉❤
congratulations Lisa! He's beautiful!
Love hearing your birth stories Lisa. I am expecting my 3rd baby this winter and having a home birth as well. I always appreciate your encouraging stories! Thank you for all you do and praising the Lord for a healthy baby and mama!💜💕
No pain???? Just “intense”? Huh  Crazy!
Oooch  I have one and had prodromal labor. She was still 10 days overdue
Congratulations Lisa & family & welcome little  Victor. Thanks for sharing your beautiful birth story Lisa & get all the rest you need. Much love..💕🍼👶
Congratulations!
YOU are such an inspiration to me and my family (amongst thousands of others)!!! Love your content and thank you so much for sharing 😍
At 39 + 3days pregnant I watched your baby #8 update video the “Simple Farmhouse Life” channel. I loved what you had to say about managing contractions and the Bradley Method. This lead me to research Bradley Method positions just in the knick of time. At 39 + 5 days my blessed baby girl came and I had my 3rd unmedicated hospital birth. It was calm and peaceful just like I had prayed for ❤ thank you for sharing your experience it was truly an inspiration.
Congratulations, Lisa, Luke and family and welcome Victor! God bless you all!
I am 66 years old and used the Bradley method to have my children starting in 1978.  I was 21 years old, and  my first son was breech birth , 8 lbs and 21in and they did not know he was in that presentation. The labor (where contractions were significant and regular was almost two days...  I delivered him in the hospital having pushed for almost 3 hours intermittently  I believe. (In-between ultrasounds and fetal monitors 😮)...That was very stressful on the baby and me.  Finally ...  The delivery was "ouch"...but thanks to a very good physician and the techniques I had learned with the Bradley method I completed a fully natural birth. Minimal tearing.    It was truly the greatest achievement in my young life.  My second and third sons were delivered in a birthing room...sooo much better than starring g at the gray clock on the green wall!   😊...Thank you for letting  me share an old timer recollection.
Congratulations & welcome baby Victor! Love being able to hear his breathing in your mic while feeding
What a blessing! Congratulations!
Congratulations! Victor is beautiful. So glad everything went well. Rest up and love on little one.
Victor is beautiful!!
Congratulations to you and your family! What a sweet baby boy! ❤️❤️
Congratulations. Excellent work.
Congratulations!❤
Congratulations!  God bless 💙
Lovely Victor!  He's like "who are you even talking to Mommy?"   I'm glad you had a smoothe labor and birth.  But it's good for us to be reminded that even moms of 8 children will sometimes experience something new!
Congratulations on another precious child. God bless him and keep him safe always.
When I was pregnant with number 4 last year I had a lot of anxiety that I had three incredible, uneventful births (two at home) and didn’t know if this time would be different. I was reminded that at the time you had had 7 vaginal births with so many at home and it seems they keep getting better for you! So thankful for your example and willingness to share your story. I’m so blessed by it! Congratulations on your sweet baby boy. My son is now 7 months and it’s hard to believe how quickly the newborn stage goes by. Love his sleepy newborn face ❤
With my first, I had prodromal labor for three days that only stopped when I hopped in the shower or bath. I didn’t know that; so I had my midwives come multiple times that time, and I never dilated 😂. Like I was 2 centimeters and was so discouraged. Didn’t learn about prodromal labor until months later. I felt crazy telling friends that I labored for 4 days, but that wasn’t the case! You don’t know what you don’t know. 🤷‍♀️
Congratulations and welcome to Victor. 💙💙💙💙 He's beautiful. God Bless you all. 🙏✨🕊
He's such a handsome baby❣️ You look wonderful 🤗
What a darling boy! He is so alert. I loved when he looked at you.  Praying my next baby is a boy, after two girls lol I need some calm to my daily drama!
Thank you Lisa for sharing.  Victor is precious.  Congratulations to you & your precious family.  God bless & keep all of you. 😊❤😊🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Congrats! He’s precious!
Congratulations!! God Bless you & baby Victor he is beautiful!! I love your videos. 🙏🙏💙💙
Congratulations again!
Congratulations Lisa on this beautiful little miracle ❤
Wow I wish I could have a home birth and be able to go about my day to allow labor to pass but you can’t legally have a home birth with a medical professional here in Nebraska. I’m blessed to live and hour away from one of the only birth centers in the state but I’ve still had to go to the hospital to be induced for both of my babies due to my water breaking. First baby my water broke and labor stopped two hours later and  after 14hrs didn’t start again(was gbs positive) my second my water broke 7 weeks early 🙃 thankfully no gbs and baby was able to stay in until 34weeks. Congrats on your new precious gift!
Have you don’t any research on taking alfalfa to reduce the risk of excess bleeding after brith?
All I can possibly say is God bless and May he keep on giving you joy :)
Congratulations on your new blessing.❤🎉
Congratulations! How did you pick the name Victor?
Victor is a beautiful little baby boy! I’m glad you are doing well! You look beautiful!
I’m so happy for your family! Congratulations!
I wish I had have known how to have a relaxed labor. My water broke on my first contraction. Everything happened really fast (3 hours total). I wasn't prepared for how quick it went so I didn't get any time to relax. Congrats on the birth of your baby!
Congratulations!! He is so precious !
I'm so enjoying hearing this story! My littlest (and first home birth) is turning 1 in two days. Similar situation, I called my midwife (that lived an hour away) 35 minutes before my June was born 😂  I just wanted to add that different states have different laws, in case someone is listening and planning a home birth. In Virginia I had to get an appt with a doctor and get a prescription for some medications that may be needed, including pitocin for excess bleeding. Midwives in Virginia technically can not give that to you.
He’s beautiful!! 🩵
Beautiful baby, beautiful momma. Congratulations.
Congratulations!  What a handsome little guy !
Congratulations
Just amazing!!!! Honestly! You go through labor gracefully. Praise God!
Congratulations on such a gorgeous baby boy! ❤
Welcome to the world baby Victor 💓💓💓 thanks for sharing your story Lisa it's incredibly encouraging 🙏 wishing lots of rest and peace for your postpartum phase 🩷
Congratulations!!! Victor is a beautiful little boy. 💙💙💙💙
Congratulations.  Hope all is well.
Congratulations…. You both look wonderful.
Congratulations! I hope you don’t give him the immunization shots normally required. Our daughter-in-law has had all 4 babies at home and has realized the shots aren’t good. I’m so thankful. God bless you and your family ‼️🙏🏻
My last two babies my contractions were also 10 minutes apart until the end.
Congratulations❤🎉
I just had my 4th baby recently and I had such a hard labor. I remember watching your last birth video when I got really discouraged and the part where you talked about relaxing and laying down and breathing through contractions totally worked. I had had several weeks of prodromal labor and I was so done. I wish I would have just kept going and distracted myself but I had had Braxton Hicks for months before and I was just so discouraged. Thank you for posting real life birth videos so I feel like I'm not alone!
What a sweet baby. Congratulations to you all. May God bless and keep you!
Congratulations homebirths are such a wonderful blessing ❤  I've had prodromal labour with my last 4 babies. Up to a MONTH early. It's really a mental roller coaster. Commiserations. What a beautiful wee boy you got in the end ❤
My grandma always said to rest the 7th day because that's when everything goes back in place. She had 8 kids too 5 girls , 3 boys. My grandfather was one of 20 .
Congratulations!!!
Congratulations, Victor is adorable, all that hear😮, just perfect 💗 I'm so glad you both are doing well 🙏🏻
Congratulations 🎉♥️
He is so handsome and you look amazing. God is so good! Congratulations!
Congratulations! What a wonderful birth story! Victor is a terrific addition to your beautiful family! God bless!
I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOUR POSITIVE STORY!!!! US SPRINTER WOMAN, FCKN OLYMPIAN DIED RECENTLY BECAUSE OF COMPLICATIONS THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE SHE WAS DELIVERING BABY AT HOME! I DON’T CARE, DIE IF YOU LIKE SO, BUT DON’T MAKE OTHERS BELIEVE THAT IS SOME COOL SH.T TO DO.
Congratulations!! 💙 Three of my five had very similar stats, too. And had a ton of prodromal with my 4th... it is definitely unnerving! My midwife almost didn't make it with my 5th because contractions were so sporadic I wasn't sure until the last minute! Every birth is an adventure. 😂
Lisa,  You are a champ mama.😊 Thank you for sharing your experiences with the world and your knowledge on home births. Many women will benefit from this.  ❤️       Lilly
Question: Do you feel your contractions in your back during transition and even early labor or are yours mostly abdominal? My contractions are always only Charlie horses in my low back 😂 so I’m just curious if you’ve had that experience/if the Bradley method helps you with the back “pain” (pain for me, intensity/pressure for you 😝)
Absolutely beautiful
You have beautiful babies. Congrats to you all! ❤️🙏
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉 God bless your family ❤❤❤
Hi Victor!! ❤❤❤
Congratulations! Victor is beautiful with big beautiful eyes! I watch you all the time and really enjoy your vlogs.
I had prodromal labor with my last child similar to yours. A week later after a speedy forty minute labor she quickly arrived a few seconds before my midwife arrived.
At 3 days I was still bedridden
Whatcis that blancket? Why do you use that? Is it could?
you inspire me so much! thank you for sharing this! so thankful to get to know you through YouTube. so encouraged for my homebirth in December because God & you <3 congrats on this beautiful new babe! God is good.
So encouraging! Congratulations!
What other hobbies do you have?
Congratulations!!! Sounds like you are a very strong minded and strong willed woman ! 💪🏻❤️ He’s gorgeous!!! 🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵 God Bless Him ! What a beautiful name
Hi, nice to hear about the birth at home. In here, the Netherlands where I live, it is normal to give birth at home without doctors. We have vroedvrouwen (midwives) here. They help women to deliver at home togehter with the father and family. Very peaceful and natural. Enjoy the newborn-time!🎉❤
I love your videos! I have 9 kids, 5 boys and 4 girls! I had them all in 15 years. They are grown now, and sometimes I really miss those days! Enjoy your time with your family. It goes by way too fast!! ❤
What a beautiful child! Blessings to you and all your family!
Congratulations!  Victor is adorable.  Glad to hear it went well.
He is beautiful and so are you! Congratulations!
Same with pushing. With my 4th I thought “nope, not pushing again so we’re gonna get this baby out in one push” 😂
Congrats🎉 you look amazing! Happy for you and your family. Your a GREAT MOM❤❤❤
Congratulations to you and your family on Victor's arrival!! He's a beautiful baby and you look amazing! Very thankful that all went well!! Looking forward to seeing more of all of you!! 💞 God bless
I always find these videos so inspiring. Then I think, she’s probably super woman, we should rate how badly a stubbed toe hurts you so I can have some kind of gauge on how you handle pain! 😂
8 kids you had too much sex in your bedroom 😂
So excited for the baby day vlog! You look amazing Lisa, and your little boy victor is stunning, you’re an inspiration to me in soooo many ways! I’m excited to try Bradley method with my next home birth 💪
Congratulations! So happy to hear God answered your prayers for a daytime birth! We just had our 6th baby at home 3 months ago and my kiddos woke up to a new little brother! Enjoy these next couple weeks with the newborn sweetness!
Oh God Bless you, Victor, and your family!! He IS absolutely precious ❤ Thank you for sharing.  I'm a sucker for a birth story especially a home birth one.  Rest well momma.
Congratulations!! He is so beautiful and I love his name! Sending you lots of hugs and enjoy your down time! ❤❤
Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy!  I would love to hear how you deal with anxiety in pregnancy regarding the health and safety of the baby. I’m 8 weeks pregnant with my second, and every couple days I’m overcome with anxiety that I’ve done something to harm the baby or that I might be about to have a miscarriage or that I might catch my husband’s fever, etc. I’m also so afraid of my child being born with health issues and how heartbreaking and difficult that might be. I remember being anxious with my first, but it’s actually worse this second time despite having a healthy first baby. Do you ever struggle with this?   Also, how did you come to be at peace with allowing children to come when they come? I always thought you had to plan out pregnancies, and I’m trying to shift my attitude regarding avoiding until you are “ready.” I’m starting to feel that this isn’t a healthy way of thinking.   I appreciate your Christian perspective!
Oh my god, congratulations on your 8th. ❤ Such a beautiful and big happy family of yours. These days I haven't heard anymore of such a big family, before when it was my parent's era they have a big family and the normal count was they were consists of 10-12 siblings. I wish your family a wonderful blessings and abundance of everything. How I wish I had even 1 child, but I have none. I don't know what's God plan for me.
I foubd you before I had my 1st baby and believe it helped me figure out to have such a peaceful smooth birth - maybe too peaceful - I didn't think to go to the hospital until it was basically time to push! I showed up at 10cm dilated both kids and told right away it was time to push! Contractions do not bother me. The transition I wasn't as  "cool" for - but expecting my 3rd now - and hopeful I can relax more for it! Yes I basically slept through all the contractions my 1st labor.. I massaged them at times and they never felt intense. My 2nd I didn't feel like massaging them they were different but also not painful. I LOVE he Bradley method and the books you recommended "birth without fear" I think was another one? Victor is adorable ❤  thanks for the story!!!
Beautiful and encouraging story!  I do have a question: I am a VBAC patient after my first (10 years ago) was an unplanned, emergency C-section.  My midwife prefers to deliver me in a hospital for that reason, and my husband also insists on it (he's in medicine).  Do you have advice for implementing "home birth" techniques in a hospital setting?  Thank you!
Congratulations
Just wanted you to know I have tried to watch this video 12 times but life 🤷🏼‍♀️ so 13 of these views are mine 😂 trying to watch this whole video without kids lucky number 13 here we go !
Congratulations!  So glad it all went so well.  My after birth pains were always intense.  I felt like I was having another baby.  That was over forty years ago so I'm sure the newer methods are more helpful.
🎉Congratulations on your sweet baby boy! 🩵👣
Congratulations
Congratulationa!  May God bless you all!
Congrats!  So happy all went well, even with the anxiousness.  Blessings to all of you! 💙💙💙
Praise God for giving you the strength and courage to birth 8 babies. May all they grow to become a great blessing for you and for the whole world. God bless you dear. From India, mother of 7 children.
Congratulations on the birth of your  8th baby!!  He is precious. I look forward to seeing him grow as I have Daniel and Theo (started watching you back then).  Hope your up and about now feeling better and enjoying the family.
Precious 💕
Congratulations on this blessing!
Congratulations! He is perfect.  I just had my 6th baby 3 months ago. 3rd home birth. Your birth reminded me so much of my birth with my 6th! I was in denial too. My midwife was wise and just hung out at the park across the street because she knew! She made it just in time and our little boy was born on our living room floor after one push! It was my easiest and most pain free birth. Hugs from Oregon!
Congratulations to you and Luke! God bless you. What a non scary picture of labor you are giving to your girls.
Wonderful story! Makes me wanna go through labor again…almost 😆. We have 5 boys/men and now  our 1st grand daughter. Birth stories are in our past. Thank you for sharing precious Victor with us. Blessings and wishing beautiful bonding days for all of you! 🩵
You look great! Thanks for sharing and congratulations! ❤️
What a beautiful baby!  Gods gift to you!
Crazy comes after the birth!
Heartfelt congratulations!
Praise the Lord for Victor Isaiah!  Also praise to the Good Shepherd for a good and easy labor, in spite of the prodromal labor, the extra long-cord and the heavy bleeding!
Congratulations to you and your family. Well done . I’m so happy your son Victor was delivered with no complications. Enjoy your baby and your rest over the next couple of weeks . I had two uncles who were both called Victor. They were both very handsome men.
I wonder if the pitocin is why your afterbirth cramps are more intense.   So happy that you share your positive stories!
Congratulations! Sounds so much like my fourth labor. Prodromal labor and then very fast intense delivery with cord around the neck. What a blessing he is! Congratulations again, Mama. You did great!!
I love seeing positive stories. Lol when I was about to have my last of course algorithms were giving me horror stories. I got off social media.
Congratulations sweetie!! ❤❤
Congratulations!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Victor looks like a little angel. And yes!! I agree with everyone, he looks super alert and ready to chase chickens through the fields 😂😂❤. Thanks for posting these honest and positive birth stories. I think I'm officially done having babies (I'm 38...)but I can forward these stories to my sisters and younger mom friends❤. God bless you and your family.
I really enjoyed and was encouraged by this account of your birth! I'm pregnant with my 3rd and will have my 2nd home birth with the Bradley Method but have been feeling anxious leading up to the birth. Still have a month give or take.. I was surprised and encouraged to hear your labor patterns are very similar to my last birth. Very helpful to hear how someone went before me in the same pattern with a relaxed birth. :) Enjoy your rest period!
Thank you for sharing your beautiful story and beautiful baby...
You are amazing!  Congratulations ❤😊
congratulations you are an inspiration would love to know what you really use post-partum. God Bless
My midwife gave me a shot of pitocin after having 5th baby because placenta did not come out for some time. Right after  it came out with very minimal blood involved
I love that he threw you for some loops in the lead up to birth day! What a precious new life, already teaching you things 😊
Congratulations, Lisa! ✨💚✨
Congratulations!  He’s beautiful!!
I had prodromal labor for 8 weeks before my daughter was born(she tried to come at 28 weeks), we made it to 37
Congratulations!! This video was super helpful to me, thank you! ❤
Prodromal labor can be so confusing! That happened with my second baby (first natural with no induction) and our birth center was 2 hours away. Thank God we got a hotel the night before because active labor to baby in arms was one hour 😂
🎉❤ Congratulations 🎉🎉
Thank you for sharing your story. I love watching the videos of your beautiful life and home. Congratulations on another baby and birth!  Prodromal labor really makes you question everything. 😅  I would say the majority of my 7 labors were like this. It always made me never know when to call the midwife or go to the hospital.  I tried to distract myself. She barely made it with the 3 out of 4 I had at home.  One birth, she arrived maybe 40 minutes, maybe less,  before the birth.  I was 8 cm and she felt a baby  butt. 😅  I guess I'm glad I waited to call because I didnt really have time to  decide on what to do. The baby arrived quickly and safely in a breech position.  My last baby was much like your's I knew if I stood up the baby was going to arrive. I did that side lying position and decided I wasn't moving. The midwife was only there a few minutes before my daughter was born.
Congratulations! I have been praying for you to have a safe birth and I’m so glad to see you both and in such good health! Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy!
Congratulations, God blessed him and protect him at all times, blessings to you and the whole family, thank you for sharing your experience. Victor, Welcome to this  world!
He is precious 💙 You look great❣️God bless.
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉
I just had my first baby in April using the Bradley Method! It was the most amazing experience. Thank you for sharing your story and congratulations on your newest little guy ❤
Trying to find your podcast. Once you are back at it you may want to put a link to it on your about page. Just an idea. I'm going to go Google it for now. Thank you for sharing your beautiful birth story. So happy to hear it went so well for you. Rest, rest, rest!
Congratulations on the birth of precious Victor!! You are Amazing! Our GOD has blessed your family with the gift of your sweet children!
Congratulations! What a beautiful baby boy! I have bee watching you for a couple of years and am amazed at how you are able to juggle everyday life with your whole brood. You make it seem so easy. God Bless your whole family.
Congrats to you & your family! 🎉
That was a lot of details. I feel bad for you tubers if you all feel as though your viewers are expecting to know so many details about your life like if you tore during labor. I think most of us just want to hear if you gave birth at home or in a hospital…natural or c-section…how long were you in labor…any complications… baby was was born healthy…we would covet your prayers in this area. You know, general story. Congratulations on the safe delivery of your sweet Victor!!
I had a feeling it was going to be another boy!
Lisa, you look beautiful and radiant, you are an inspiration to us all who enjoy your channel. I often think of you as I go about my house chores as you have taught me to do this with love in my heart for my family (though I admit I am nowhere near as good at it as you!). God bless your newest arrival, what a sweetie, and may our LORD continue to watch over your precious family. Thank you for all that you do to keep inspiring us to look after our families.
Beautiful  baby just found your channel .
Thank you so so so much for sharing. I find it so interesting.
How is your sister doing? Hope she has had a safe and peaceful delivery as well!
I've never heard of these things you talked about before. It brought me to tears knowing now there's a better way for mothers to give birth. I had my one and only at 27.5 weeks and he was 2.7 lbs. four months of nicu and me staying at the hospital 20 hours a day.. I didn't even know there were other options for full term labor. I pray your video will reach other expecting woman and they learn from you. Bless you and all of yours. Hello little Victor. Welcome to this crazy beautiful world.
Congratulations for your new little boy. Enjoy your precious little boy. He is adorable. You are a very strong lady. Love your channel.
Beautiful ❤Baby…love his name. Sending you all love prayers hugs & kindness.
Congratulations!!!! What a beautiful boy!!! ❤❤❤
thank you for taking the time to tell us about the birth! God bless you and your sweet family!!!
Congratulations! Victor is glorious! God Bless!
Congratulations to all!!!

Beautiful communication Lisa 🫶🏻 Welcome little baby Victor 💙
Congratulations 🎈
He is so alert, and so, so sweet! Congratulations 🎉❤
Amazing story and he's beautiful , look at his eyes my lord. Hugs friend Elissa modesto cali @elissa_tc
I’m excited for that video! ‘Trying to film a normal Vlog but went into labor instead’ or something for the title lol 😂
Congratulations! How precious! 👶
Congratulations ❤ has your sister had her baby too?
Thanks for sharing a snippet of your birth blog , looking forwards to when you are ready to show your whole experience of Victors out coming day 😊 he is sooo alert  , the was he was laying there drumming his lil fingers listening to your story as you were telling of the final moments was very endearing to see . Such a lil cutie pie & you are such a relaxed mum we’ll done 🎉
almost 9 billion people on a planet built for 2 billion and these morons have 8 kids. Personally they aren't mentally qualified to have any.
Congratulations on another beautiful child❤ great to have some good birth stories. I wish I had know more back when I had my first baby nearly 10 years ago.
You are both such angels,  precious and beloved.  What a wonderful soul you are to quieten any mama to be's fears. Rest up and enjoy. Great great job. 🌿🌱🌿🌱🌿🌱 🌳
You are so blessed to have natural births. 2 breach and 2 breach with placenta previa equalled 4 c-sections.
Oh my word his hair!! Congratulations mama! Such a beautiful blessing 😍❤️
He is adorable, Congratulations❤💙
Congratulations!  What a precious gift from God!
Congrats!! I love your birth stories Lisa. 🥰  The anxiousness I can totally relate to when you don't seem to normally be anxious! I just had our fourth baby in February and a week or so before i was SOBBING that I didn't want to do this and all these emotions. It was nuts to me because it was my fourth planned homebirth, and I'm normally so incredibly chill about birth that my midwife has to remind me to call her when I need her to come. I strongly believe that emotional release, paired with some prodromal labor the week before birth, helped my labor to be so much quicker than the other labors and also got my mind and body in the right state for "go time". I ended up having the midwife there ten minutes before the birth and I was still wearing pants when I started pushing! 😂 I was right next to the birth tub and was all, "I'm pushing... And I have my pants on..." lol   Anyways I had never heard of the pre-birth anxiety like you and I had, but it must be a thing no matter how many babies you have!
What does it mean to be “very in your head”? I’ve never heard that expression before.
Thank you for sharing.  I love hearing birth stories.   So exciting.  Good job!   Praise God!
You make me want to have 4 more babies. I LOVE your story!!
Oh my goodness, I had a similar experience with my birth this past March! I had my 4th baby. All of my babies came a couple days earlier than the last, so I was really expecting her to be a week early! And I knew she was on the bigger side so I was anxious for her to come sooner rather than later. She ended up coming the day before my due date… my water broke and contractions didn’t start for over 12 hours! It was a mind game for sure.
Oh my goodness.  Bless you and the family. You're just amazing  Lisa ❤❤❤
Congratulations❣️❣️❣️
Congratulations on your new baby. I love listening to your baby birth stories. One thing I am curious about is how is the pocess for getting a birth certificate and social security #  for your baby after a home birth? Is it done through your doctor or the midwife?... Thanks a lot for sharing your story/life with us, it's very inspiring.
Congratulations! I think he looks like Luke right now😊.  I had those week long labours for a good week, day and night, with my daughter. And didn't progress at all it was so tiring. But when it started and my water broke at the beginning  in just a few hours, and indeed only 10 minutes 3 pushes I had her. Which for your first is really quickly they said in hospital (and why they didn't really check me because they had counted on at least 16 hours of labour).
Congrats! All I could think about the whole video is how much hair he has and its such a beautiful color! So happy for ya'll. God Bless.
Lisa! I am a mother to 10 ages 13 down to 4 months and I have to say, the distraction technique is my fave thing too!  ❤😂 Have you heard of Supernatural Childbirth book by Jackie Mize?  Also a YT video with scriptures called Childbirth In the Glory? Some may like that resource! Also I gotta say, 13 years ago, I went to get that book, The Bradley Method, 1 week before my due date, to try and study and use that technique but on the way out of my neighbors place, it was dark and I tripped right on my belly! My water gushed out and I didnt have but 4 hours before I had my baby! I still havent read the book 10 babies later because my labors go quick, but I would LOVE❤ to know more about how you use the Bradley Method. Sounds like how every labor should be! Congratulations again on your sweet baby and I pray that many many Mamas are encouraged by your peaceful birth! We were Created to bring forth life. We have learn to take every thought captive. Fear is liae and is the only thing stopping us from experiencing beautiful blesses births!!!❤❤❤❤
Can you please link the app and track you used for the Christian hypnobirthing help mentioned?
Wow !! This was me with the prodormal on baby number 5 . Really was hard getting out of my head after that. Everything you said was super helpful and makes complete sense!! You are awesome! Will look into Bradley method for any future babies! Love the name Victor ! I’m Veronica and my dad is Victor
Congratulations the two of you. Blessings to your beaitiful family.
Congratulations Lisa so handsome he is god bless
Beautiful boy
Agree keep doing stuff snd that does work . Had my babies in hospital ( a long time ago ) all were born in under 2 hours and even with a breech and face up no more than two pushes .
I'm the mom of 10.  Although I had easy births, I got more anxious with each pregnancy.  My husband called it performance anxiety. Family, friends, doctors, and nurses expected me to go quickly, with no issues.  I would go from 3cm to fully dilated in one or 2 contractions.  Doctors have missed the deliveries (even when they were at the hospital). LOL, I've delivered fully dressed with my shoes on, because once labor actually begins, I progress so rapidly.  I've never pushed more than 3 times. I had always hoped for a home birth, but because my pregnancies were high-risk, that wasn't an option for me.  I'm glad that things went well with you. Your little one is adorable.
Congratulations and thanks for sharing
Congratulations beautiful on your son's birth. What a gorgeous little boy and love his name. God bless your family and hearts.
I always love listening to your birth stories! They are so calming to hear. Welcome little Victor ❤
Congratulations, he is beautiful and a awesome blessing.
Congratulations! I had prodromal labor in three out of my four labors- Its extremely exhausting especially when you have it for weeks on end.
Congratulations on your baby 👶 Victor!
Congratulations to everyone!! So happy everything went ok for you and Victor.
He’s beautiful - love all that hair !!!! 😊
So beautiful ❤
Beautiful. Congratulations ❤
Ohhh! Hello Victor! I love seeing his eyes open and moving his arm around, thanks for sharing and not waiting for him him to take a nap!  My 2nd one was very tangled up in the cord, not fun. But we were still able to have a natural birth, I'm so grateful!
Lovely! I really enjoy your videos. I don't know how you do everything you do! I've learned so much about cooking and home care.Very inspiring. The world is such a crowded place!
Congratulations!  He's so precious.
He’s absolutely beautiful ❤ Congratulations Family on Boone ❤❤
He is so alert. Congratulations
Congratulations!!! I have followed you since your last three babies!!! I've had two natural births and love your channel. I was stunned when you said what this baby's name is, because my father in law's name is Victor and my husband's name is Isaiah!!! Beautiful baby boy, he will hold a special place in my heart 💙 thank you for sharing another positive birth story!!! ❤
Congratulations! Sweet story and babe in your arms. God bless your family!
He is sooooo precious. You are such an eloquent storyteller. Thank you for sharing this beautiful birth story with us. Big hug!
❤
Did your sister have her baby yet?
My children are 26 and 29… I did the Bradley Method with their births. I’m so glad I did.
What a gorgeous and alert little one! Congratulations!
Bright , alert, and hair !!  Congrats !
I’ve had 3 sections and am determined to have a vbac this 4th pregnancy. I know you don’t have a similar story at all but listening to this and one of your recent podcasts about pregnancy has just brought so much encouragement to me! So thank you!
What was the hypnobirthing app?
So happy for you Lisa. You are so powerful, in heart and mind! You and Luke have an amazing family! Welcome Littlest One!
Congratulations! ❤️🎉
Congratulations ❤️
You are amazing!
I can see the post-birth high in your face. <3 Such a joy. Great job, mama and congrats! He's a cutie!
Congratulations, he’s perfect!!! 👶🙏🏻
A new baby! ❤ a precious gift fresh from God! God bless you all! 💙
Just listening to his cry!!! Bless him! He's gorgeous! So alert at times! Dark hair, blue eyes? Congratulations Lisa and Luke! 💙🎉💐
I had prodromal labor with my last two and it’s the worst, but I agree that it reduced early labor by a ton and it went so fast once it was the real deal!
Congratulations! I’m pregnant with baby #3. Have had an unplanned csection, in hospital VBAC & now planning a home birth for this baby. Thank you for sharing your birth stories with us! Do you recommend the Christian Hypnobirthing? Did you feel it was helpful?
Thanks so much for sharing with us all Lisa ❤❤❤
Mama, that’s a gorgeous little man! Congratulations 🎉.
Congratulations!!! He is perfect! Praise the Lord!
Congratulations! 😃
I love listening to birth stories! I always had low iron, even when I was taking iron supplements. I started taking grass-fed beef liver capsules and my iron was in the “normal” range within days and it’s stayed there since! He is so cute. Congrats!
Victor is such a beautiful baby congratulations on your 8th child he is so precious like all your family love you all have been with your channel since the beginning 🥰🙏🏼♥️ your truly blessed.
Congratulations Lisa! Victor is adorable!!!
What a great name!
Congratulations to you and Luke ☺️. Welcome Victor!!! ☺️🩵🤱🏼
Praise the Lord for your sweet baby!! I have been praying for you this week! Thank you for sharing. I had my second homebirth November 2022. After my first homebirth, I watched your video about using a moby wrap! Thank you for posting such uplifting content. I have been enjoying your podcasts about homeschooling. God is so good!! I will keep praying for you!
If this is a one dad house wow!
Congratulations! Victor is a sweetie! ❤💐
Congratulations! You are blessed. Beautiful family and a great legacy.
You look beautiful, Lisa.  Very well-rested for a new momma.    Love his name, too.  💙💙💙
❤ he’s so precious
Congratulations 🎉 If I had easy pregnancies like you, I would have had 8 also! Instead I have 4 of my own and I’m raising my granddaughter. I’m so blessed!
I only had one baby boy (now 4) and man, I remember the blinding back labor pain. It was fast too, but OUCH.  I’m happy yours went smoothly ❤️
Beautiful young man.  What a blessed addition to your family.
Blessings Lisa & baby Victor ❤🎉 You are a super women 😊❣️🙋🏽‍♀️
I literally had the same thing happened with my 8th baby!! I had a whole week of false labor and was so exhausted by the time it was time for the real deal, I also had to be induced because we couldn’t get the labor going, maxed out the pitocin and still no baby, I was in tears when they finally said they would give me something to relax and 40 minutes later baby was born 😂
Congratulations!! What a blessing! He is just beautiful!! God bless your precious family!
Victor is a precious boy!  Congratulations to you and Luke on the birth of your son.  God is good!
God bless you and your precious baby boy!
Congratulations to the birth of sweet Victor 🥰 happy to hear everything went well for you.  I too had my Baby (no 3) this Monday 24th at home! What a blessing they are 😍 also can totally relate to just knowing the feeling of "this is it, I'm really close" despite the time between contractions being longer than those "guidelines". i had the same thing happening, it's so beautiful to just listening to your body
Love his name! He is so precious! Look at all that hair! Awesome job Mama!💐❤👣❤️
well done Sweetie..Blessings to you and your Family..
Congratulations!!
Ah so precious So thankful all went well! Get plenty of rest! HE'S Beautiful!
Congratulations Lisa, Luke and family! He’s an angel. 😀
Congratulations!!!!! God bless all of you
Congratulations to you and your lovely family!!! What an inspiration!!! God bless you all.
I havent seen all of your babies as newborns but i think ive seen either 3 or 4 . But anyway it seems like you usually have babies with just a little fuzz on their heads. This baby Victor has a lot of darker hair. I was so surprised. Hes just precious! Glad everything went so well and you and baby are doing so well. And like always you look great!😊
Congratulations to you both and your families he is absolutely adorable God Bless you all
He's too precious!! So happy for you and your beautiful family!
Congratulations Lisa!!!!! Bless you all!!
I could have wrote this birth story with my 6th! With those 10-15 minutes apart I KNEW it was transition contractions for hours...It was not my normal labor pattern with my last 5 though as there's were all straight forward, contractions started baby was here within 3-12 hours (depending on the child lol), wish I had found your channel and heard your birth stories before she was born a few months ago haha.  I did the miles circuit 3x the day I had her.  Stood up at 8p and they switched from 10min to 1-2min, then she was born at 8:49p! LOL Did a first push, water broke at 8:45p, went to bed, midwife walked in at 8:47p, and she was born at 8:49p! I think her hand was up in her face and as I did the miles circuit throughout the day her hand moved down and by the 3rd time her hand must have moved down far enough to be delivered. The midwife had to pull her hand out bc it was near her chin before her body came out!  LOL!  Loved hearing your birth story. I am the same way with the pushing, just ready to be done, lol! So beautiful! You look amazing and your sweet baby boy is so precious. I hope God blesses us both with more children!  I am glad you didn't have to transfer and they were able to get the bleeding under control immediately!  I have been to over 90+ births as a birth photographer, midwifes assistant and doula and surprisingly have never have been to a Bradley birth! Congratulations!! I'll have to post some of my positive beautiful home birth stories at some point to encourage others.
Congratulations Lisa, I'm glad everything went well, He is precious!!!, Thank you for sharing!!
Félicitations!You are so relax, and your baby is magnifique...! be blessed from Québec.

Hearing stories like yours gives me hope that a future homebirth for me could be different and peaceful! rest up and enjoy your little bundle! 🥰  Also just wanted to say I’m from a family of 8 children (I’m number 4). I loved growing up with so many siblings. It’s a big blessing for sure 😁

Congratulations! You both look fabulous ‼️ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Congratulations! 🙌 He is precious. 😘 You look amazing, way to go Momma! 🎉
Great story, thank you for sharing! Serious question, HOW do you do it all? You have lots of children, you make YT content, you make your own bread, cheese, etc… you have farm animals…. Like, I can hardly get through my day with ONE kid and a helpful husband. I also have help from my mom and MIL too. I’m just sitting here shocked, every time I watch your videos… I truly do not understand how you do it and I would really love to know. God bless you!
God is so good! Congratulations to you and your family. I'm currently 19 weeks with baby number 5 and I hope I can have a birth like yours! ❤
Yay! So sweet... Congratulations, Lisa❤❤❤ He's precious! Always love your content and love these videos especially🥰
He’s beautiful!  😊😊😊
Expecting home birth baby #9 in a few days, and this was exactly the reminder and encouragement I needed to hear!  It is so true that what you picture beforehand is never what it’s actually like while it’s happening. We forget that God supplies all the graces we need in the moment.  Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy!!🩵🫶🏻
Sweet baby and sweet story ....thank you for sharing.
Thank you for sharing your story lisa 🥰 god bless you and baby victor🙏
He is absolutely precious!
He is precious ❤
Congratulations, your baby is beautiful.
Congratulations! Will you list all your children off by name?  Not sure if I have heard all of them.
Congratulations Lisa!! What a precious baby boy. Bonus seeing him bright eyed! GOD bless you all 💙
Congratulations 💜 God bless him
Can I ask what hypnobirthing app you used?
FAST video upload with a newborn, ily! 🥺
It was so fun to hear your story. I just had my first home birth, and it was a very positive experience! Within 4 hours flat, I delivered my 11 lb 3 oz son complete breech! I'm now a fan of homebirth, too! ❤
Wow congratulations !! I pray that you'll have a smooth postpartum recovery in Yahusha's (Jesus) name Amein. ♥️ TEHILLIYM (Psalms) 127:3-5 את CEPHER ♥️ 3 Lo, children are a heritage of Yahuah (God) and the fruit of the womb is his reward.   4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.   5 Happy is the man that has his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
❤ Victor is a precious baby boy. Well done Lisa, you truly are an amazing woman. I bet Luke and the kiddos are just besotted about him? Take it easy now Momma, looking forward to seeing your in labour video!! ❤️🙏🇮🇪
Baby is so alert for 3 days. Beautiful,  God bless
Congratulations! What a beautiful boy!
I had my last two sons at home. It was a wonderful experience!!
Congratulations! So happy for your husband, you and family! Thank you for your wisdom and insights! We are prayerful for our 5th baby to come to conception soon. Love seeing your handsome son🩵 Bless you for sharing your birth story.
A BEAUTIFUL BABY!!!!  PRAISE THE LORD!!!
Congratulations, Lisa, and thank you for sharing this beautiful story. My dad’s name is Victor so I love his name! Try the Bradley breathing with those postpartum cramps. Bless you and your family.
He is a little doll....
Congratulations! He is so precious. Thank you for sharing.
Thank you for sharing your birth story Lisa. I loved seeing him wake up. He’s a beautiful baby. Wow six boys in a row! You will have quite a farm crew there. And your girl’s I’m sure are being very helpful.
Oh both of you are so gorgeous! His name is perfect ❤ God bless you and your family.  your strength and confidence is so admirable. I learned about the Bradley method from you and did it 2 years ago it was the best birth experience I’ve had yet! Thank you!
Beautiful yaaaaay! So much joy.
Congratulations on your newest little blessing!! Look at his beautiful hair!! ❤ He is adorable & you are glowing!! I was so looking forward to this video. I can't even believe how similar our experiences were - I just gave birth to my 4th on July 12th and I also had the prodromal labor for the first time followed by an extremely fast labor and the easiest transition I've ever experienced! So fast in fact that my husband caught the baby while the midwife was on the way over lol!!  I had prayed to not have the shakes this time & for a fast transition and the Lord answered!! So encouraging that He also answered your prayer for a daytime labor. I pray in Jesus name for your cramping to ease up and for a blessed postpartum time of healing and enjoying your newest little love!! ❤
Wow what a beautiful baby boy ❤congratulations 🎉
Congratulations 🎉
Congratulations!
Happy Birthday handsome little man! Great job, sourdough sage!
I had my babies in the early 2000's, and I knew no one who talked about anything pain free unless it was with an epideral .  Love hearing your birth stories!
Who does all your homemaking chores while you recover from the birth?
Congratulations Lisa! Such wonderful news, which brings me much happiness today. Blessings to you and your family xoxo
Congrats on you guys' baby boy! I have a question Ms. Lisa, so I know your approach is to go long without thinking about it, but perhaps it went past 41 weeks or something like that, what would you do, like what is your max? Thank you!
You are a super woman, Lisa! Praise the Lord for a safe birth and a healthy, precious baby. Blessings!
Congratulations! He's so beautiful ❤
You are such an inspiration, Lisa! Thank you for sharing it all
Thank you Jesus for blessing Lisa and Luke with a healthy baby and welcome Victor to this family I love your video's and your family is precious ♥♥
Congratulations! Victor is adorable and you look great!
Congratulations! Thanks so much for sharing your beautiful birth story with all of us. Victor looks like such a sweet baby.💙
I have watched you a long time and love your family! Congratulations and welcome baby Victor! I am curious if you will continue having children until you naturally stop or will you decide when you want to stop?
Congratulations!  I love his name.  I'm so glad he's safely born and you are well and looking so lovely.
Congratulations to you, Luke and siblings! Victor is a precious gift for sure. GOD bless 💜
Congratulations on the newest son.   I am a mother of 4, grandmother of many and great-grandmother of 6..  However,  I still enjoy all of your videos.  May God bless and watch over your whole family. 🙏
Congratulations! So very happy for you all! Victor is beautiful! May God bless him all his years!
Can you talk about your favorite foods postpartum??
Congratulations!
You are AMAZING!! ❤❤❤ Thanks to your birth stories I learned about the Bradley method for my 4th baby and it was amazing. My  first three births were actually pretty nice, I do agree with that distraction method I kind of did that naturally. But for my 4th baby using the Bradley method was by far my best labor. I wasn't even 24-hours post baby and I told my husband I needed a #5 😂  Congratulations  and God Bless!!
Congratulations on the new wee one!❤
God bless you ❤️🙏🏻
Beautiful baby boy!!  God bless you and your whole family!
Ahh he is beautiful!!!!!🎉 Still praying for you and a more comfortable recovery.  So happy for you!  New life is always a miracle to experience like no other. Take care, Lisa.  Congrats to your family.  Yay Luke
Congratulations he is so beautiful!💙
Congratulations! He’s beautiful.💕
He's so sweet! Congratulations! Thank you for sharing your positive birth story.🤍
Congratulations! 🎉 New subscriber.
Watching this while I feed and rock my 5 week old 🥰  love hearing others' labor stories!
I can see why that would bring anxiety! I was in labor 33 hours after the water broke. So discouraging. But that was 10 years ago and all is well :)
Thank you so much for this! I’m due with my second on the 17th and all these reminders are so helpful! My first was a home water birth and planning the same for this one. I probably listened to the Bradley Method book 3 times with the first pregnancy and about to listen again for this one as a refresher. I read Childbirth without Fear this time around and am feeling the confidence and excitement!
He’s so sweet!
A beautiful blessing.
I’m 34 weeks with my 2nd after 8 years of waiting and praying and I’m getting pretty anxious. Does anyone know the Christian hypno/playlist that was talked about? Thank you!!
He is so beautiful! What a wonderful blessing for your family. Congratulations.
Congrats Lisa! Another beautiful baby. The 8th one is a charm. At least mine was. He was also my last 😂 They’re so much fun though. Enjoy! ❤
Congratulations ❤ so glad everything went well!  Thank you Lord🙏🏻
Congratulations on another beautiful baby!
Congratulations
Well done Lisa, he is precious. 😊
Congratulations again! I'm so happy for all of you! He's beautiful and you are amazing!
Beautiful. Congratulations.
Congratulations 🎈
I had 4 children naturally with the Bradley Method ~ the worst after birth cramps were the ones  I had after given progesterone to release my after birth. Thank goodness it was only that one time!!!

Also curious to hear more about the name-something you just liked or in the family, etc?
Congratulations on your sweet 8th child.
Praise God! Congratulations on your newest little blessing!
This sounds so much like my last home-birth. Baby number 6 first boy I had the weird contractions for a week and then I woke up with intense contractions.  Called my midwife and in less than 2 hours my baby boy came out. My midwife made it 25 minutes later. It was so fast but so in amazing. You are a rock star. I can’t hear noise or move around in labor. Ps I love your channel so much! Great job momma!
Congratulations,he is beautiful. God bless
So happy to see you have had the baby safe and well.
Felicidades,es pressioso
❤
Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy! I can absolutely relate with this birth story. My last(6th baby, all boys!) pregnancy I experienced prodromal labor for the first time. The contractions were very real. It shook me to the core and I began to doubt myself. Thankfully, my midwife picked up on what was happening and made it to the birth in time. Once the contractions went away, my midwife insisted on coming out. We set up the pool. I wasn't having ANY contractions at all. I get in the birth pool and immediately I am ready to push. Unfortunately our hot water heater goes out at that moment and the water is too cold to deliver. I tell her I will just have the baby on the floor, but no, she and my husband end up boiling water(for what seems to be eternity!) I pushed him out so quickly that he was born in the caul. I did bleed much more than usual. He was born around 3:30am. ❤️
Thanks for sharing such an honest and uplifting birth story!
CONGRATS!!! He’s beautiful! BLESSINGS!!!
Congratulations, I love the name
Congratulations, he’s big.
Loved hearing the whole story. Prodromal labor is the worst! I’ve had it every time after my first and it really can drain you and cause anxiety. So happy to hear it made it quicker for you and that it was almost pain-free. Amazing! You are truly blessed. Wishing you a smooth recovery and no more after birth pains. Enjoy these precious moments!💕
I can't even wait to watch the video to tell you Congratulations on your newest arrival!!!
Absolutely wonderful story. You’re such an inspiration. Thanks for sharing Lisa 🙏🥰 Victor is divine 💙
"Biannual birth story" 🙏🤣 Love you sweet mama
Aww, so cute. What a precious gift from God!  Maybe you mentioned and I missed it: is he named after someone? 💙
Congratulations ❤
Congrats on welcoming your newest addition to the family ♥your family is so beautiful ! Thank you for sharing and God bless 🙂
Congratulations
My husband and I welcomed our 3rd grandchild this week, July 26th. Our daughter had her second child, again another boy, in the hospital I work. As the matter of fact I just finished my evening shift on my maternity ward. To work a shift, with my new grandchild right there was so special. Then I come home and I listen to your video, Lisa. It's all about sweet babies today 😃
You are always so calm and Poised. Great birth story. Congratulations! He is beautiful
Congratulations! And I want to say that it feels so good for another Momma of 8 to say that you couldn't really tell the prodromal (I'm not sure how that is spelled) labor from the "real" I've had it with 7/8 of my babies and people always seem so confused that I am so uncertain. 😂
Thank you so much for talking about that cycle of fear and pain that happens during labor. I have had 6 children, 4 all natural births. But Ive never succeeded in relaxing during labor, although I do still prefer to have an unmedicated birth. When I watched other women's birth stories of pain free, relaxed labors, I just figured they were stronger than I was. Now I see that we have those feelings, but need to find the mental control over them.   Also, for my 6th I had prodormal labor for a week. It absolutely speeds things up. I woke up to my water breaking and had her in 45 minutes. You can add precipitous labor to my chart. 😂
Sorry I don’t think birth at home is not good.  After 8 th baby the uterus can get boggy and then there can be problems.  But it’s all up to you. But I think you r taking a chance.  When I worked in womens center and a woman decided to have a home birth and had other children and she died of hemorrhaging. So to me it’s not worth it,   When some women bleed after birth you can’t get to the hospital on time.
You are an amazing mom & an amazing person! Rest up and enjoy these next weeks! Congratulations to your family!
Congratulations on the birth of Victor!! He is so cute and sweet.  My last birth (7 weeks ago) was similar in the way that it was not too painful and he kinda just fell out in between pushes that were about ten minutes as well.  I had looked into hypno birthing before birthing too and I think that helped.  I thank you for sharing your story with us!
Congratulations! I just delivered a baby girl on 7/20. The whole time I wondered how close we were as far as due dates. I guess within a week!
He's so beautiful! Congratulations!
Congratulations!  My 2nd child, Sean Patrick Duran also weighed 8 lbs 4 oz.  Many blessings, Kate
how far apart were your contractions during prodromal labor?
God Bless, Congratulations, and Welcome to Victor Isaiah!
So beautiful! Congratulations and welcome Victor!
Lisa, Luke and family, congratulations!! You were in my prayers for comfort, and a safe delivery. Victor, you are  loved. Rest well Lisa!
Congrats to you and your hubby on your new edition to your beautiful family may God bless you all 🙏😘
Congratulations!  Happy for you!
Congratulations. He looks so big, and oh so cute. Take care of yourself and baby too.
So happy to see he's here and that your both happy and healthy! Congratulations on this special arrival!
Beautiful baby boy 💙Congratulations!
He so beautiful, it sounds like such a lovely birth❤
Thank you for sharing your birth story Lisa. It must be so encouraging for the young mothers watching. My Grand daughter recently had her first baby. It is wonderful to see young moms using the Bradley Method. I had wonderful births with that method. God bless you and Victor and your whole family with this new life! Sm
Congratulations! You’re amazing! Welcome to the world precious Victor! Praying for your speedy recovery and lots of blessings over your sweet family.
What a beautiful account of this birth!  God bless you, your baby and the whole family!
He's amazing. He looks like a little man. You did good momma. Be blessed.
God bless you and your new addition to your family! Suck amazing gifts that the Lord gives us.
Couldn't wait to watch this! So glad it all went well love your birth stories.
He’s beautiful!  A precious gift from God. Congratulations 😍
CONGRATULATIONS  !!!
Congratulations, he is so precious! I’m 14 weeks with baby #5, this will be my second homebirth and I can’t wait to try  the Bradley Method! ❤️
Congratulations 🎉!! prayers for a smooth recovery 🙏❤️
I have been praying for you! I'm so glad to hear everything is going fine. What a handsome little fella 😍.
Lisa you are amazing mama!!! Congratulations!!
❤
Get it girl!!!!
Lisa you are blessed for being able to grow a big healthy family <3
Ooooooohhhhhh how beautiful!!!! Congrats!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Congratulations. Little Victor is just precious. I know it’s to soon to tell but I think he looks like his daddy. 🎉🥰
Congratulations!!
Beautiful and encouraging birth story! Congratulations to all of you! Children are such a gift from God. As an advocate for positive birth, I so appreciate your amazing birth stories! Thank you for sharing. Now get lots of rest, mama!
Congratulations and God's blessings!
Congratulations Lisa, he is so sweet! Many blessings over your entire family. ❤
Thank you so much for your detailed description of this exceptional birth story. After all, every child comes to earth differently. Gongrats
He's beautiful and I'm so happy for you❤
Having lots of babies makes for such a blessed family and your family blesses the world. I’m thinking of the other kids and their reaction to having another sweet little one to love and dote on. What a precious time! Newborns smell so good and I love to kiss the napes of their necks,mmm. So sweet! Congratulations! It sounds like you have this birth thing figured out, I wish I would have been trained in the Bradley method with my kids. I had 3 home births and I tried to be relaxed, but I wasn’t always. Oh well, home birth is wonderful anyway.
Congratulations Lisa and welcome Victor! One thing to share in my recent experience with pushing baby out in 1 push - the time they spend in the birth canal ( think ring of fire ladies) pushes the excess amniotic fluid out if their lungs. My baby's O2 levels were low because he came out in 1 big push and was essentially blowing bubbles out of his mouth that was amniotic fluid. The hospital experience wasn't fun and if I am blessed with more children I will absolutely be trying to hold off one 1 big push and allowing the time in the canal to help babies lungs prepare.
CONGRATULATIONS 🎉🎊 HE IS GORGEOUS SO VERY HANDSOME ❤🥰😘Welcome to the world Victor & Happy Birthday 🎂🎁🎈
Congratulations!
Another handsome baby boy…congratulations Lisa and Luke and family.
I love this!  I completely understand what you mean about prodromal labor speeding things up and causing extra focus on the birth.  My first two were medically necessary c-sections where the anesthesia didn’t work but hypnobabies kept me sane and from feeling the full pain of surgery. The second surgery was also after 4 days of labor and 12 hours of pushing (scar tissue from the first surgery blocked his shoulders from coming out, despite his head being seen at the exit point). With my third I had a doctor due to my midwife being on vacation all of December and me being considered high risk due to my medical history and having gestational diabetes. I was expecting to go into labor per history from 35 weeks to 37 weeks. Nope, I had 4 weeks of prodromal labor and woke in transition at 12:30 in the morning. My doctor had just recently landed in San Antonio for her Christmas vacation (because I was expecting to have had to baby about 3 weeks before and the trip was already set), it was an ice storm, and my hospital was 2 hours away. Oh, also while I was stuck on the toilet for an hour expelling the contents of my bowels and screaming for help, my husband and two sons slept peacefully until I finally stopped messing myself and was able to walk for 30 seconds at a time between contractions to wake my family. My husband figured it was just more prodromal labor and tried to put me to bed. Nope, I yelled for him to call everyone and get his dad, who wasn’t part of the plan to come wait with our boys while we drove to the hospital since my aunt lived 40 minutes away. During this process my birth doula was on the phone with both us and my doctor to get the hospital ready. We hopped in the truck and my water automatically broke (never had that happen before naturally but the sign I had prayed to happen if God was blessing me with a vaginal birth). The water broke like a comedy with the full gush, pop sound, and so much pressure I had whiplash from being launched into the backseat from the floor. Within 5 minutes of driving (speeding down the empty highway as fast as my husband’s truck could go to beat the ice forming in our area) I yelled for him to stop. The pain had basically stopped as soon as my water broke and I felt a bubble run through me. He managed to call 911 as he ran to the back and had a towel under the baby’s head with the first fetal ejection reflex and the body with the second. He came out Superman style but we didn’t know I had minor knuckle tears until 10 days postpartum after the swelling went away and it was healed by then. It took 20 minutes before the ambulance even showed up. From the time of waking was 2 hours of labor but really only 45 minutes from when my doctor was called. It was the most incredible experience and if we have another we will probably just stay home.  FYI, I did specialized chiropractic care, pelvic floor therapy, and used a womb doula for uterine alignment and scar tissue work throughout my pregnancy. Oh, and my birth doula was also my therapist who specializes in birth trauma PTSD and postpartum mental health. I recommend to any mother to pray for the right team and let God know your desires.
LOVE!! Congratulations!! I too have had this experience!! Distraction and relaxing is key!! Take more collegan for the afterpains!! Amelia
Congratulations! He is precious 😊
Congratulations he’s beautiful ❤️
Hi Lisa when was he born vicky
Congratulations!  Victor is beautiful.  What a blessing!
Victor is so precious.   Congratulations to you all.   What a special blessing.
Congratulations Luke and Lisa with the new baby boy! I'm grateful for safe delivery. Many blessings
Congratulations!!! I am 37 weeks with my first and had been hoping that you were due before me so that I could hear another one of your success stories!! You are an inspiration!
Congratulations on baby Victor  !👶🎉
Such an inspiring story! So glad he is here and you’re both healthy. ❤
Thank you for sharing. I’m always amazed at how God created us to birth babies♥️I didn’t have children and always feel blessed to be around Beautiful Mamas like yourself. Love his name. God bless you and all your beautiful family♥️🙏🏿😘
Beautifully done! Congratulations mama!
Congratulations, Lisa and Luke! You look fantastic. Victor is beautiful.  I’m quickly approaching 60, gave birth to three babies over 30 years ago, have one grandchild and am still fascinated by birth. Thank you for sharing your story of your 8th child’s birth. ❤
Ah many congratulations Lisa, Victor will be a wonderful addition to you family.  So lovely seeing him resting here in your arms. Every blessing to you all ❤
Congratulations!!! He is beautiful!  You ought to become a midwife!
You’re a rockstar and such an inspiration 🙌🏼 thank you for sharing 🙏🏼 preparing for my first 🤍
Congratulations on your sweet new boy ❤  My daughter would have been a Victor if she had been a boy 😊 It’s a great name!
O my he’s precious
Beautiful birth story and baby ! 🌸🤱🌸
Welcome to the world, Victor.  May you have a most wonderful life with all your siblings.  God bless everyone!!
What are all your children's names vs. what they typically are called.  I'm a name person.
Happy birthday to Victor!  Welcome to the world. 🌎.  It's a beautiful place and you are blessed to be in this family.
This makes me smile even more because it sounds so similar to my birth this last December 🤗 although I think my midwife was only there for 5 minutes before baby boy was out. Fast labor + miscommunication + midwife living 35 minutes away = a crazy story to tell my son when he's older.
Congratulations 🎉🙏
Congratulations, so cute!   🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 for quick recovery!
I used the Christian Hypnobirthing app for my second baby last summer, and absolutely LOVED it! So calming, and when you use it for several weeks beforehand, you really are able to get into that positive mental space so much more easily. I'm so glad you found it and it was helpful, and I would definitely recommend it to any other pregnant mamas out there!
He is adorable. Congratulations
Congratulations on little Victor!! Take care of yourself mom😊
Congratulations Lisa! Oh my goodness, he is so precious!! (Those sneezes!! Aaaaah!) I discovered your channel maybe two or three months ago and have been loving your content!! I had been toying with the idea of a home birth for this pregnancy (baby #3) but it wasn't until I listened to a few of your birth stories and you talking about the Bradley method that I decided to try it out! I still have a few months before baby comes but I just got the book you have recommended so many times and I am hooked! I can't put it down! I feel like everything makes sense, I am recommending it to all my mom friends now! Thank you so much for your content! Congrats again on bringing another angel to this earth! Prayers to you and your family as you recover!
Congratulations! You are such a positive role model. Sharing your pregnency and birth stories in such a calm and reassuring manor. Blessings to you and your beautiful family!❤
Congratulations on a beautiful baby boy ! What a blessing! From a Mom of seven an now a grandma of sixteen.
Well done!!  Welcome to your new world, Victor Isaiah! Congratulations to all of you! ❤🥰🙏🏼
Congratulations Lisa and Luke on another beautiful, healthy baby.  He is just adorable!!!!!!
Congratulations so very happy for you and your family, Baby Victor so very beautiful
He is such a baby doll 😍 congratulations!   This sounds a lot like my last labor/birth. I had prodromal labor also, and when I finally went into "real" labor it was only 2-2.5 hrs from first contraction to baby out. The intense contractions only lasted about 45 minutes. I had never had that happen before 😅
What a precious baby. thank you for sharing.
Congratulations!! 🎉 So happy for you!!
Congratulations 🎉💕 So happy all went well. He is such a cutie!
CONGRATULATIONS
He is so cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Congratulations.
After medical mistakes in the hospital with my first born, I LOVED having the rest in the peace of my home.
Congratulations! Loved listening to your birth story.
Congratulations!
Congratulations!!!!
I can’t take my eyes off that beautiful baby! Just a perfect little head! 🥰 Congratulations!!
I think I smiled the whole time I watched this! Your videos have helped me find joy and beauty in homemaking. Thank you! ❤
Congratulations!!! He is adorable!!!
What a blessing to have your baby at home.  Congrats!  Victor is so precious.  I am 60 and expecting our first grandchild in January.  I cannot wait!
You never cease to amaze me. I'm thrilled for you and Luke on the birth of your 10th baby. You are so wise in how you handle every ad ectvof your life. My son's name is Victor, but because he's a Jr, he goes by middle. Rest up mommy, and enjoy bonding with your newest gift from God. ❤️👣👶👣❤️
Congratulations 🎈
Well the world needs more good people and you raise yours so positively and gently, your contributing to a more hopeful future of the world.
Congratulations, Lisa and Luke! Victor is an awesome name. Sounds like an awesome birth--makes me excited to hopefully get to have more kids! With all three of my births so far I have had prodromal labor, and it is nooo fun. It didn't make my labors shorter though hahahaha. But all still amazing birth center and homebirths! If you're interested, myrrh shea butter suppositories are great for preventing tearing! TMI I know, but they really work! You can make them yourself or get them from a health food pharmacy.
Victor is such a perfect little guy! So much hair! Congratulations to you all! ❤️
❤️❤️ Precious!! Love your distraction method. I actually do that too. 😆  With my last one in particular, I just decided to ignore what I thought was just more predromal contractions that morning and then I was holding a baby less than 2 hours later. 😂 I've had 2 natural/med free births at the hospital and then my last 2 were unassisted homebirths. 🥰  I've heard of the bradley method but I've never tried anything methods specifically, except for the carry on with your day method. Lol I think I gleaned from various methods I had read about and just making sure I was breathing and my hips were relaxed was my thing. My labors have always been fast and have just gotten faster with each one. Do you think your after birth cramps were worse because of the pitocin? Or maybe you've had pitocin afterwards before. I felt like mine got worse after each baby but I've never had pitocin so I'm curious about that. I remember being pretty uncomfortable after my last one. So happy went well and now your little guy is here! And praise God that He heard your prayers for a day time birth! I love that!!
As a wife to a Victor and a mama to a Victoria (middle name), I absolutely love his name! What an inspirational birth story! Congratulations to you all 🎉
Congrats! Love seeing the newest farmhouse on Boone member
Had my 4th in June…prodromal labor! That’s what I was having!! I had no idea this was a thing. On the day I went into labor..3 am I knew it was different. But I didn’t want to get the midwife too early. Amazing how our bodies just know…when we finally got her there, she felt baby’s head right away! And this was the easiest labor by far. Most peaceful too. I too used the Hypnobirthing tracks! I always did Bradley but this time I decided to try Hypnobirthing. Those tracks were amazing
Congratulations 🙏🥰Victor is beautiful 🙏my husband's name is also Victor❤
Raspberry leaf tea.
Congratulations a beautiful lil guy ❤💙
I looooooove his name
Congratulations! Thank you for sharing and being so positive and transparent about labor and birth 😊 enjoy the rest you can get!
Omg yes I had prodromal labor with my 3rd baby and it was the most confusing shit
I couldn’t hardly wait to see your beautiful baby boy.    He is absolutely perfect.   Rest all you can and enjoy your sweet baby.  ❤️
Welcome to the world, Victor, with your beautiful head of hair and your cute little sneezles!
Congratulations!! I loved hearing your birth story. I wish I had all of this wonderful information when I had my kids and I’m thankful that through your videos that other young moms will have this information.  Enjoy all those wonderful baby snuggles!!
I’m so glad all went well. Congratulations!!!!
Congrats Lisa. I can't believe you posted this already, you look great. Theo's positive birth story is how I first found you on YouTube. :)
Welcome, Victor 🥰
Sooo beautiful and precious, congratulations on your new baby! You are truly blessed
So glad you and baby are doing good. You look great.
As a young mom, thank you so much for this detailed story! It is so important for women to hear birth stories in detail, specifically unmedicated and at-home births! 💓 I plan on having as many children as the Lord gifts us, and your advice is always amazing.
Congratulations he’s beautiful
a powerhouse of a lady!! and you both look goRGEOUS. so healthy and vibrant!!
Congratulations,he is so cute.
Congratulations!!beautiful baby.
Congratulations.  Such a precious baby boy
Beautiful baby God bless him. Thank you for sharing. Can I ask you a sort of personal question? Why do you have a large family? Is it for religious reasons? Do you come from a large family? Or do you just enjoy being pregnant and being surrounded by your beautiful children? Children are such a blessing. Lots of work but great.
Congratulation! He is so beautiful!  Thank you for sharing his birth story!❤️
I admire you so much. I’m 74, well  past baby making, but my one experience at 21 was so traumatic I never wanted to have another one. You rock!❤
Congratulations, Lisa.    Thanks or sharing the birth story of your precious baby boy.   Your transparency and God honoring content is important, informative, and encouraging whether your are talking about sourdough or homebirthing.    Your channel is inspirational.
Congratulations Lisa,Luke, and Family! He's absolutely beautiful ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I experienced prodromal labor for more than a week with my 4th (3 months ago). My poor midwife came to my house twice before it was actually go time. 🤦🏻‍♀️I really thought he was going to come the first time, I got all excited and then majorly let down! The last week was hard, he was 4 days late to top it off! Congratulations, love the name!
He is so precious!!! Congratulations !!
Congratulations to you and Family!  Victor is Beautiful! God Bless  P.S. Hearing your birth story helps me to understand  better my one and only birth experience 37 years ago.  I wanted 10 kids . Things have really changed in birthing and I see a defiant positive change for women.
he is beautiful congratulations and a beautiful birth story glad you and baby are well god bless you
Congratulations 😍🥳🤗
Congratulations to Luke and you, Lisa, and hello to beautiful, very alert Victor!  He is curious already!  ☺👶A gorgeous head of hair has he!  Thanks be to God for good health for you and your baby, and many blessings and protection upon your family and household!  Thanks be to God for all things!  🙏
Congratulations 🎊   you truly amaze me ❤❤
My first was also at 2:23 p.m.
❤❤❤❤❤❤du bonheur , tout le monde attendait😂
I'm wondering if your husband wants the midwife there a little earlier?
Watching your video now!!  Victor is absolutely precious.  Your such an inspiration for young mothers and have so many beautiful memories for each of your children's births.  Congratulations to your family! ❤
He is beautiful!
Congratulations on your new son, he's beautiful.
My 2nd was my first home birth, and he was the only one so far (out of 3) to have a bunch of prodromal labor. He ended up being my longest birth (9 hours vs 8 and 5 with the girls), and came 2 weeks later than my girls. It was also the most intense labor, but that’s probably because I didn’t breathe well, and didn’t click with my midwife team super well. I was too in my head with him.   I love that your husband is the one who ended up taking over texting the midwife to say for the midwife to come on. My husband is always the one to tell the midwife to come, because I’m always in denial, even though my contractions tend to come quickly and strong once labor starts. 😂  Congrats on your handsome little man!
Congratulations he is a beautiful boy God bless yall
So much wisdom in this. Please share more birth-related content. You mentioned on your podcast an alternative treatment to GBS with garlic etc. I know it’s not for everyone but I’d love to learn more from you.  And CONGRATS. Beautiful baby.
Precious gift from God!  Congratulations
Congratulations!
God bless
Congratulations!! What a beautiful birth story and addition to your sweet family! ♥️
Congratulations Lisa to you and your family.  Victor is so precious. So bright.  Thank you for sharing your birth story with us.  Take Care. God Bless All of You.
Brilliant. Congratulations
I had almost a week of prodromal labor with my last baby too. I just did some extra walking and otherwise carried on with life. I did end up doing the miles circuit on a Friday night and had baby about 9 hours later 😂  I loved the labor reel you posted ❤️
You + your baby + your background = amazingly gorgeous!
The ignore it method has carried me through all my home births too! Beautiful story and what a sweet little man!
Congratulations!!🎉❤
Congrats!! Victor is a beautiful baby!!
Wow, you look so fresh after child birth
Beautiful story ❤ Welcome to the world baby boy! Congratulations to your family🎉
I totally get your experience of intensity without pain during labor. My sons are both over 40 and I'm a grandma now but I will never forget how great the home birth experience was. It was so exciting!
It’s so interesting that i just had my forth and was so similar. First prodromal labour and also didn’t know how far I actually was, the midwife literally made it to the last contraction.  When i started pushing my contractions had just been still every 10 min and not even that intense. And suddenly im pushing. So you just never know. Thank God for good births…i love your birth stories. ❤
You are amazing going through up to 24hours of labor.  I only had 3 kids and the first was 10.5 hours, 2 was 1 hour 43 minutes and 3rd was 54 minutes start to finish.  Dr told me if I had another I would have to live at the hospital the last month as I lived 30 minutes from the hospital.  So you going through labor and delivery at home is amazing and a blessing that you can do this so naturally.
I enjoyed your birth story.  I had my first home birth in April of this year. . Baby number 4.  I too bled quite a bit after delivery  and had to have a quick shot of pitocin after the delivery of placenta . Grateful for quality care and quick responses per midwives.  I can relate to your story in quite a few ways.
I'm in the home stretch with my pregnancy #6. I really appreciated this video! My 5th baby (last year), I had prodromal labor for four weeks before I  finally went to the hospital to be induced.  I was planning a homebirth with a midwife, but she was extremely unhelpful with the prodromal labor. I went to the hospital becaise my water broke and 30 hours later, contractions still had not picked back up after stopping. Anyway. Thank you for this. It males me feel hopeful for this birth that I CAN have the birth experience I've been wanting. ❤
I had prodromal labor with my first also my second but with my first I really resonated with "how will I know to call my midwife?" Because that was me with going to the hospital! The nurses were so annoyed, and family and friends just thought I couldn't tell the difference between Braxton Hicks and labor.
Lisa, 👏👏Boy, are you a PRO…👏👏❤️..congrats on such a beautiful new boy❤️..Love, Liz
Oh he's so very precious.  T u for  sharing. Love his name
Congratulations!
Girl you rocked it. Praise God! He is beautiful.
He's absolutely adorable. Congratulation! Thank you for sharing your birth stories.
Congratulations I’m so happy for you again. What a beautiful family and the love for each new life. I could go on all day. So very happy for you
Congrats on the little one.  Glad everything went well. I just had a baby 5 months ago. I looked in the bradley method. But with this one I couldn’t lay down because it was pain. I was in the shower which helped me relax.  I thing the most important thing is that you find something that relax you Because if you are relax things get better. What ever way you do it. I know that if I would have another one and I could have it at home I will definitely try the ignore method for the beginning. Enjoy the baby cuddles.
Congratulations 🎉 he is so precious
Congratulations! Victor is adorable!
Beautiful birth story! Congratulations on a precious baby boy!
felicidades, gracias a Dios todo te salió perfecto, es muy lindo tu bebe.
Congratulations!
Congratulations,  he’s such a handsome boy.

Wonderful ❤️ so happy for your healthy happy birth. Love his name!!! Congratulations 🎊
Great job mama! Would you mind sharing more info/links for the Christian hypnobirth playlist you mentioned?
Congratulations!! He’s absolutely gorgeous! I love hearing your birth stories, I truly appreciate how you try to approach them without fear, knowing this is what your body is made for❤️
Congratulations! He is beautiful, and thank you for sharing! We have 11 children, and you brought up so many good points! God Bless you! My after-birth pains were intense after baby 8 and with all the rest. You're doing fantastic! Sending love from Wisconsin!💕
Congratulations Lisa & family!!! 💙🙏✝️
Congratulations!! ❤
Congratulations Lisa & Luke! He is beautiful ❤
Thanks for sharing your birth story. I always enjoy them. I watched the short video of you in labor with your apron on in the kitchen and outside . I told my husband Lisa from Farmhouse on boone is in labor. He said what is she doing? I said she is cooking and then out in the garden picking flowers; leaning over during a contraction. LOL. Once again Congratulations. Victor is a beautiful baby, and so much hair.
Deo gratias!! I love his name. Prayers for y’all to have a wonderful transition!
Beautiful birth story!! So encouraging. Planning for my first home birth in December with baby #2. Just wondering what is the app you used that relaxed you? Would love to check it out and see if I could utilize it! Thank you!!
Hello. Good luck! All the best. Have a beautiful day. Bye. Rudi.
You are so strong and brave! Love your stories and love seeing your beautiful children! Wow God! Only Him! 🤗❤️🙏
Congratulations! He is adorable! Thank you for sharing your story. My boys were born from the late 80s to late 90s and I really wish i knew this was a possibility.  It seems so much more peaceful and natural.  So happy everthing went so good for you and that you were able to pull yourself out of the headspace that stressful for you.
I've had several births with prodromal labor. I like the tip on just staying distracted and ignoring contractions until you know you can't any longer.
Congratulations…..❤ Better start buying some large pots to keep all those boys fed……the two I had ate a lot….I always had soup cooking when they came in from school……tides them over till dinner. Having a large freezer full of meats and veggies and fruits was also a help. I canned 120 quarts of applesauce and 200 qrts of  tomatoes and tomato sauce. Six kids was always two pies, one large cake and many many cookies….. Hopefully you can have another freezer fridge in your barn for extra milk etc….. Glad all went well.
Time to get going on number 9!
Awe yay congratulations ❤
Well done Lisa!  All the best to you and Luke and the family and especially to little Victor.
Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy. What a little blessing. Take care.
You are an amazing young woman and that ba by is precious
All the love 💕
Congratulations 🎈🎈🎈🎈
Congratulations!! He is so handsome!!💙
Congratulations! He is absolutely precious ❤
P.s. his hair is gorgous!
Wow!!!!!! Another boy! Rejoicing for you and your beautiful family!
Congratulations he is beautiful !! God Bless You and your family 🙏🇨🇦
congrart   don't know how you do it my mom had 12 and my sister had 6 children they are a lot to take care of good luck with all
You are an amazing young lady. He is so adorable….I loved how alert he was and how he looked around at everything.  You look so refreshed and beautiful too.  Thank you for sharing your birth story.👶🏻
Congratulations!!! He’s adorable 💙
Beautiful baby boy, congratulations ❤❤
OH MY GOODNESS! Look at that precious newborn face 22 minutes in the video. He is SOOOOOO adorable. Congratulations! I was so happy when I saw you posted this video. Thank you so much for sharing. I hope to use your distraction tip this time around! So wise.
Congratulations!
Congratulations Lisa! He's beautiful ❤ Watching this while holding the baby I also birthed just a few days before you gave birth to yours 😭 Loved hearing your home birth story!
So happy for you! I just had #5 May 12th at home, and unfortunately I allowed myself to get into that anxiety/tension state, and it ended up being my most painful birth. I knew after the fact why it was so bad and where I had gone wrong, but in the moment it went so fast I couldn't get myself under control. I said #5 was the last but now I want a redo 😅
Congratulations!  He’s precious and beautiful!  God bless you both!  ❤️🥰
He’s precious, enjoy every minute you have with him❤️
Beautiful story and Victor is so cute - welcome to the world little guy!
Darling little baby!  I'm glad the birth went well!
Beautiful, inspiring story :)   So sorry about the unnecessary pitocin in your leg and the rush on the placenta, truly it is sad how many interventions happen because of the comfort levels of providers rather than the needs and intuition of the mama. Praying you have a blessed and restful postpartum with sweet Victor!❤
Congrats! Bass family.  Another addition to the farmhouse!
Congrats on the new baby
I totally relate. I had prodromal labor for 7 nights before I had  my fourth cesarean. It was hard to keep starting and stopping. Love to hear your story!
Congratulations!! Ive been following along knowing our babies would come close together! My son also arrived Monday 🥰 12 days after my due date and also my first time experiencing prodromal labor so I completely understand the anticipation 😅 but on the plus side it gave me a lot of extra time to get the freezer stocked  with more sourdough bread, pizza dough, tortillas and shredded chicken so this postpartum has felt so much easier for our family to rest together! And he also came fast with my water breaking to start stronger contractions and then he was born an hour and a half later! Definitely worth the waiting! Thanks for sharing your life and inspiring us all ❤
Welcome to the world Victor! You are darling!! Wishing life's kindness only on you,always.
Congratulations!! We just had our 10th and it was our first home birth. Listening to you made me realize some things I need to do differently next time, but it was a great experience overall. Love the wisdom you share just by telling your story ❤️
Exactly - im always on the phone telling my midwife "I don't want to ask you to come too early" - then hand the phone to my husband for a contraction and he tells her to come. I have a Victor also.
That little fella is very alert. So adorable. God bless you and your precious family 😊
Congratulations! Welcome to the world little one🙏🏻
😂 I'm just going to go about my day and forget this ever happened. 😂 That should be on merch. 🤔
How precious he is so sweet congrats and thank you for sharing your story
I had a planned home birth with my son, 9 pounds later. It didn't turn out as expected. You are a champion to have to have your 8 buddles at home.
So happy to see your face this morning. Congratulations to the whole family and welcome Victor.
Congratulations a handsome boy
I read The Bradly Method on your recommendation, fully intending on having a natural birth but in the hospital because my husband was a little bit nervous about a home birth for our first. Everything went sideways when I went into labor at 31 1/2 weeks. I spent three days in the hospital and then my son was born at 32 weeks via C-section because he was breach and he was coming. Absolutely nothing went the way I envisioned however, I made it to 5 cm dilated and was in labor for four days and because of the techniques I learned with the Bradley method. I never topped a six on the pain scale.  Even though it was not the experience I thought it was going to be I am so glad I read that book.   Baby spent 29 days in the NICU and he is now a thriving almost one year old.
Yay!  Congratulations to you and Luke.  He's a cutie with his little head full of hair.
Congratulations! He's adorable ❤
He looks so much like Luke and Ruthie
Congratulations to you and your family 🎉much love from Spain
I always enjoy listening to your birth stories!💜 Thank God for a safe and healthy labor and delivery!🙌🏻💜 I will definitely be doing the Bradley Method for my next birth!
Congratulations to you and your family! ❤
Congratulations to all. Victor is beautiful.
Congratulations 0n your beautifull baby.  You are an amazing Mother.  🤱🏼
Congratulations!! You look beautiful ❤❤❤
God bless❤😊
You are so blessed. ❤
Such a great birth story! Congratulations he’s beautiful like his mama! I also had a bleeding problem after birth. The older you get (or the older I get) the more I bleed after birth. Last baby (39 yrs old) I had 2 bags of pit, 2 pills that dissolved in my mouth and 2 meds up the WooHoo to stop the bleeding. Glad it stopped because I love being a mom!
Oof I had prodromal labor for almost two weeks. Then I ended  up having to be induced at the hospital at 42+2, because Ca law doesn’t allow you to have a home birth past 42 weeks.  I don’t feel comfortable being unassisted, so to the hospital we went for the first time with my 4th. 😒 It was brutal.
Amazing mama 🎉 God bless you and baby Victor 👶 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Congratulations !!!  Victor has a beautiful head of hair, so happy everything went as you had planned.
Wow thanks for sharing !Victor is so handsome he is so alert and strong ! He looks like a little man already! God Bless you and congratulations to you and your sweet growing family ❤️
Congratulations! Victor looks like Luke!
CONGRATULATIONS pretty Mama! Welcome Victor xo
Thank you for sharing and educating. Congratulations on your healthy delivery and healthy baby boy🎉 You look stunning and he’s gorgeous ❤
Such a pretty little baby.I really liked his light brown hair.
Expecting my 3rd in November! You always seem to have your babies a few months before mine so I love watching your videos as prep for my births! Congratulations! What a sweet baby boy
Congratulations and he is beautiful!  Love the name!  God bless you all!
Congratulations!
Love those nice healthy cords....frequently, if it is not tight, baby just slides through it.  Love seeing his milk coma.... THOSE PRECIOUS NEWBORN  DAYS !  Congratulations.
Congratulations!!! Your little Victor is positively precious 😍 I have found homeopathic arnica to be so helpful for afterpains, if you're still experiencing those. I've had 11 babies and it has worked beautifully. Enjoy your babymoon!!!
Congratulations on such a blessed birthing!  Sweet baby boy ❤
Praise the Lord everything went well and enjoybecery moment with little Victor. His beautiful❤❤
I commented on your birth video for baby #7, which I just watched. You had that baby about the same time I had my #7 and now you've just beat me at having baby #8. (I am currently in labor, in the distraction phase.) I was kind of hoping you'd have your baby first so I could be encouraged by your story. You have been used by God to really help my mindset with this birth. I'm going to try to relax even during transition and it is so helpful to hear another mama who dealt with the same mindset issues and came out victorious. Your baby is truly adorable and I can't wait to meet ours (hopefully within the next 24 hours :) )!
Victor is a beautiful name🩵🩵🩵
Oh Lisa he is a little love so knowing. Eyes open looking round just perfect 🤩 you are a wonderful person and a lovely mama too congratulations again my dear he is a true gift from god❤ victor what a gorgeous name. 🥰🥰💕
What a beautiful story! I love the distraction method 😅 I have 4 and the last 3 I’ve had prodromal labor for 4-6 weeks with each. It’s soo so easy to get into the head. With my most recent, I had finally accepted that he would be in there a while. I contracted a bit through a church service sporadically (being a half week overdue) and had just finished joking with friends that I would never go into labor… then my water broke in the church lobby. He was there just over 2.5 hours later at home 😆❤️  Thank you for sharing!! Can’t wait to see that half-day video.
Congratulations 🎉
So happy for you!  I loved your illustration about how you didn't have the hormones to help you through the birth until you were in it.  It's just like God's grace.....we don't know how we will respond to trials when they come because we don't have the grace at that moment.  But when the trials come, God gives us His grace to endure.  Thanks for sharing your story!
Wow !!   👏🏽 👏🏽 👏🏽   I thought there was a video that announced  'Due to unforeseen circumstances, I've schedules a cesarean for the 19.'  Congratulations !! 💙
I’ve been waiting for this video all day! Congratulations ❤ Victor is so adorable and perfect! Good job momma on another amazing home birth!
Congratulations to Mom and Dad and all of Victor's siblings! God's little blessing.
Love his name, too! I hope you share how you came about it. He's  a busy and vocal guy for sure... How blessed that he has so many to play with! Victor Isaiah came with built in friends for life.... What a beautiful way to build a life to live, with the screen door always slamming ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So glad he’s here safe!  Thank you for another positive story! ❤congratulations❤
you are always so gorgeous in your birth story videos
You are so good at explaining everything. I wish over 40 yrs ago when I had children I knew about all of this. Congratulations 👶🏼
Congratulations! What a precious boy!
I've watched your past few birth videos and loved them I've been so excited waiting for this one to be posted! Congrats, Lisa!! Beautiful birth story 🙌❤️
Lisa looks so beautiful!!!!
He is beautiful! So happy for you. Look at all that hair!!♥️♥️Thanks for sharing Lisa♥️♥️♥️
I’m 43 and the mother of 5 ages 26,22,18,16, and 9. After our “surprise” baby #5 I thought we were done and although I really did want 1 or 2 more when she was little, our lives were chaotic and I just decided it wasn’t going to happen. All of a sudden in the last couple of months I feel like the Lord has been opening my heart to having more kids, and really trusting Him with what that looks like. At first it seemed crazy but I have prayed and submitted and I prayed that my husband would lead the way with that if that’s really from the Lord. So we will see! I’m focusing on getting super healthy so my body can handle it well if we do. I know people will think we have lost it but I just don’t care. I talked to my oldest about it recently just to see how she would feel about it and she was surprisingly really cool with it. Even if we don’t have more, I’ve learned that trusting the Lord with what your family looks like is a beautiful thing even if it’s waaaay outside of the societal norms. I do hope I get to have more babies as it’s really my favorite part of life and I really am not ready to give that up forever yet.
Congratulations on your latest miracle! What a sweet little one!
Always look forward to your birth stories! He’s is so precious! Congratulations Mama❤
Congratulations!! Welcome Victor! ❤❤
Congratulation. Beautiful baby. You look great.
Congratulations to you and the whole family! He is beautiful!!
What a blessing you inspire me as we await for getting pregnant with baby #2 I long to have so many kids but even the blessing of our one child is a gift.
As a mama who is over 38 weeks and has prodromal labor off and on THE ENTIRE END of pregnancy - this was SO incredibly helpful. I got so discouraged when labor false starts began to occur at 37 weeks. I’m 38+3 and changing my strategy to exactly what you describe. I’m resting and ignoring from here on out. I had false labor for 3 whole weeks (on and off) with my first pregnancy and I need to know by now that this is just what my body does to prepare.
Congratulations! You are a supreme role model for women everywhere. ❤
What a blessing good job mama !
I had prodromal labor as well including at the baby shower scaring everyone lol! Oh my goodness, it takes all your mental and physical energy before it's time. I had to get check off every labor inducing technique, get a chiropractic adjustment, and practically jump and dance like a mad woman to keep him "dropped!" It was definitely a fast labor for us at that point too.  Congratulations to you and your family on your beautiful baby boy! 💞
Welcome and God Bless Victor ❤
Congratulations, what a blessing 💐🎊🌺🌼🌸
A beautiful intelligent looking baby! All your (minor) symptoms and birth story point to reminding you to really rest after this baby.  Don't pop up too soon or do too much. Welcome to the world Victor! A victorious birth. Congrats to Daddy and brothers and sisters as well.
Congratulations Lisa, Luke and Family 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 Your video was very encouraging to me. I had the same struggle with bleeding at the end of my last birth, and didn’t realize pitocin was something midwives can carry. Will be looking into that for the future if need be!
Beautiful!!  Do you mind specifying which Christian hypnobirthing app it was??  I’ll be having my 5th natural birth and love trying new things- never heard of this one but there seem to be several.. thank you to anyone who can answer!
I loved seeing Victor’s eyes open, so bright and alert! He’s so precious. Thank You, Lord. You are so merciful.
I love your peace and faith in the process, that is SO essential for home birth I believe. Super momma!
CONGRATULATIONS,  Lisa and Luke and the entire family!! How exciting!!! Babies are such a blessing from The Lord!! Our son and his wife just had their 3rd baby girl just a week ago, and we're absolutely smitten.  We hope and pray that they'll try again for a boy, bc our son wants a boy so bad, but we'll have to see.   Victor Isaiah is such a  strong name, and one that will carry him well through life!   It's a huge effort to come up with the "right" name for them.  But, I think y'all did very well!  Enjoy your down time, recovering and getting all the sweet baby snuggles you can!! They grow up way too fast!. Thanks for sharing your birth story, and what a blessing to it is to have you encourage other moms.
Congratulations!  Victor is beautiful!
Love that name!
Blessings to you all!!!!!
Welcome Victor what an exiting life awaits you with tons of love more love than most newbies are never exposed to once born.  Best Mommy and Daddy lots of siblings and cousins and aunts and uncles etc etc. not to mention your cyber family who send lots of love your way.  Lisa you are incredible!  Stay healthy and strong for your wonderful family.  Congratulations!
Congratulations, hello Victor Isaiah you are part of a wonderful loving family. Blessings to all.

As a mom to a 16 month old boy named Victor, needless to say I adore his name!! Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy!
God’s blessings ❤
Congratulations!  Victor is a Beautiful baby! 💙
congratulations Lisa and Luke.  I think he really looks like you, Lisa.  He is beautiful!
Congratulations! He's perfect.
Yay! So happy for you and your family! Congratulations!!!
Beautiful baby boy, looks like  Luke to me.  If baby number 9 is in the future and you want to finish with a little girl, I have read this is a great book on the topic, "The Baby Dust Method", by Kathryn Taylor.  It would be nice for all those boys to have a little sister to protect.
He’s beautiful-congratulations to you all!!
Congratulations!
You look and sound terrific! Victor is incredibly alert. Tons of blessings!
He's just gorgeous! Congratulations and thank you for sharing his story with us🎉
Congratulations to the whole family. And as always, you look wonderful!
🎉🎉🎉🎉 congratulations ❤❤ overflowing blessings
Welcome, baby Victor Isaiah 💕💙💕
So happy everything went well! I had been thinking of you and the baby and both of you have been in my prayers.
Absolutely beautiful story!! Victor is perfect!! I pray you and family have a perfect bonding time getting to know your new baby as you get into a new routine! I yearn so for a little one again just waiting now for a grandchild to love !! God Bless you !!
❤
Yay yay yay! Been waiting for this since your birth announcement!! 🤗
Victor Isaiah is soooooo cuuuteeeee 😍😍😍😍🥰 His cheeks 😍😍😍😍 God is with you for having such a wonderful & fast birth ❤️ God bless you & your beautiful family 🙏🏼✝️🕊️✨
Expecting my first, I’m hoping for a natural/unmediated birth. Everyone is telling me to get the epidural but I’m confident that I can do it without medication, Lord willing. 🙏🏼 Thank you for this positive video. As I’ve only been told horror stories and I don’t want to psych myself out. ❤
Congratulations.  He is adorable.
Congrats!! Love your birth stories :)  I just had my 5th and I had prodromal labor with my last 3. So I know exactly what you mean about “when will I know when to call the midwife”. But somehow you just know :) and all 3 of those labors were super quick! So I’d say the prodromal labor is worth it. 1st time it made me so anxious, but the other 2 times I just I ignored it because I knew it wasn’t real labor until I couldn’t ignore anymore :)
I had eight all successful adults.
The Christian hypnobirthing app was what finally gave me a painfree birth :) so wonderful!!
Congratulations! You are so beautiful as is Victor. You are an amazing Mama. So encouraging and helpful to many! 💙
It's funny that you said prodromal labor means fast birth because mine was exactly opposite. My longest birth had a week prodromal labor 😭
Happy for you and your family! Welcome Victor! 💙
Oh, Lisa , congratulations for another perfect sweet baby. You are amazing
This could not have come at a better time for me!! Praying my baby comes tonight 🤍 it will be my fourth home birth. I’m so excited and appreciate the positivity!!!!!
CONGRATULATIONS!  I'm a couple of days past my due date with #3 (second home birth) I'm getting a little bit of FOMO.  Love hearing your birth stories! he's beautiful
How precious. Welcome Victor.❤ Great job Mom.
Congratulations ❤ 🎉
Congratulations what a beautiful baby..God bless you and yours Lisa...
My first child I had prodomal contractions for a week straight 3 to 5 minutes apart. When I went to the midwife for my appt., I was dilated to 8. Thank you for sharing I didn't know their was a name for that. That was exactly 25 years ago today. Congratulations
Blessings
HUGE CONGRATS on number 8 Lisa & Luke! You’re an inspiration for many people who are about to embark on parenthood, for the first OR last time. Me? I’m a mother of 2 & they’re both grown adults now BUT I still watch your blogs & learn (as a hopeful Grandma-to-be) for future reference! 💙💚💙💚
Lisa! He’s beautiful. Congratulations 🩵
Congratulations! I’m so happy for you! I’m always so in awe of the power and mystery of birth. As a labor and delivery nurse I’ve had the privilege of witnessing births that are of a 1st time mom that behave like an 8th and births of an 8 time mom that behave like a 1st. The more I learn the more I respect that each brith is unique like the child being born. I’m so glad you share your sacred home births with us, my mom grew up in a family of 10 and she birthed my brother and me at home! I’m praying for your recovery and I’m so glad Victor had arrived safely!
GODBLESS  you husband and kids congratulations 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
hey girl- Congrats! Victor is just so precious😊 I have been praying for you and will keep on praying. God sure did give us strength during labor.  Y'all have a wonderful weekend🥰
Congratulations! He’s precious!💙
Congratulations to the family.
You are amazing 🥰 Congratulations 🎉
Lisa, I don’t know if you know this, but you are holding literally a doll baby. Oh my gosh.
♥♥♥♥♥♥
God Bless you & your family
Congratulations on your healthy beautiful boy!!! Have a great day 😊
Congrats!   So happy for you.
This was so encouraging! I am pregnant with my first, due in October, and planning a home birth. I am trying to overcome my anxiety now, so this was just such a helpful message about managing anxiety when it's actually go-time!:) I am going to read the book you recommended! Thanks for all the beautiful inspiration and sharing your story!
❤
Congratulations!
God bless Victor Isaiah ❤
Congrats on little Victor Isaiah!  My after birth cramps were  also worse with each baby (7 boys), as well as the hair falling out after was worse for me.
Congratulations! He’s adorable. He. Oh he is so cute.❤
He is so precious Lisa.  Thank you so much for letting us be apart of such blessing. Savor every minute. God Bless you and your family!!
Good job! I had prodromal labor for the first time too. Just had my 5th. Was planning my 3rd homebirth but baby was OP and the contractions were too intense. Ended up in the hospital with a great VBAC. My waters had broke before labor started and were broken for 50 hours but the amazing OB was still super supportive of us getting the VBAC and let us go as long as needed since there were no signs of infection. He even did some spinning babies maneuvers on me (forward leaning inversions and major belly manipulation, movement, massage). Had an epidural and low-dose oxytocin. I’ve experienced a wide range of births now. First 3 totally natural. Birth Center, 2 home births, then 1 c-section (transverse baby), and now a hospital VBAC. I’m grateful for all the options!!!
He is beautiful just like all your other children. Congratulations to your family!❤
What a cutie! Thank you for sharing precious Victor with us.
He's so precious! What a great head of hair  Congratulations again to you all.
Beautiful. Thank you for the info. I have debilitating chronic pain and I'm thinking I'm going to try the Bradley method and would love the Christian hypnotic birthing audio system as well.  Congratulations 🎉
Beautiful family! So glad to see everything went well. Have been sending love your way. :-)
Congratulations! You both look beautiful!
Oh I’m so happy for you! ❤ my husband and I are planning on baby number 2 in December and I cannot wait! Blessings to you and your beautiful family ❤
Goodness, are you still going to be at the Homesteading Expo?
Can you share what you do for and during your recovery?  Do you do belly binding?
So nice to see a large family! I'm one of 7 children and have so many great memories from childhood! Large families are such a blessing! Congratulations!
Congratulations to you and your family❤
Congratulations, he's beautiful.
Félicitations pour ce magnifique bébé
I have had you in my thoughts and prayers. I am so thankful to finally hear your positive birth story! You are an amazing woman and Victor Isaiah is gorgeous. Congratulations!
Congratulations and praise God! My husband and I also used the Bradley method for our three babies several years ago and it worked wonderfully for us.
You are incredible!!! Congratulations on your baby. 👶
You are just AMAZING! What a story!! Congratulations!
How wonderful! Stay blessed. Amen.
Congratulations Lisa and Luke!!!  Victor is just beautiful!!!  So happy for all of you!!  You have thee most beautiful family!!!  God Bless, take care and I will see you in the next one!  Hugs! :)
Welcome Victor!  You are so beautiful Lisa!  Thank you for sharing!!
My babies always come shortly after yours,  and I always appreciate your positive birth stories so much. It reminds me that I can do it,  and there's so much to look forward to ❤❤
I am happy for you all. And welcome to Victor Isaiah. Delighted to know that all went pretty much as you all had anticipated.
Congratulations on your new baby. God bless you and your family.
Congrats he’s adorable!
Lisa ... He is a beautiful baby!! Congrats on the new addition to your family!! 💙
Such a beautiful video. How inspiring. Your son is beautiful ❤
You’re something else!  Amazing!  God bless!
Congratulations! He is so precious! God bless you all!
congratulatios🐞🍀🍼❤
Yes omg please do post the reel. What a joy you all are! ❤
So good ❤
New to your channel. What a fun time to jump in. Congratulations on your beautiful baby  boy!
I LOVE your stories about your birth. I can relate to you so much in the concepts of being "in your head" and all you describe is extremely similar to my last two home births for babies 5 and 6 in my family. Thank you for helping me to know that my "pain free" method is very real and normal! Congrats on your new little bundle and I pray that your after pain will subside - remember the warm drinks!!!!! God bless you my friend
My 4th, 5th and 6th were prodromal labor and I can completely agree with the feelings! I’d always tell my midwife I don’t know how to trust my body because of it, but when baby is ready they come super fast!
So cute such a blessing.
Oh,i,ve been waiting for this.
You are a blessing to be a wonderful mother ,see you as a strong & powerful woman ❤💙🙏🏽
Congratulations on another beautiful baby! I’m so glad your birth experience was another good one:)
Congratulations! You are inspiring. I'm due in October with #7, we don't know what we're having but if it's a boy we plan on naming him Victor after my husband 😊
He is precious & you're such an inspiration to me. I would love to have one more baby ❤
Beautiful birth story. And what a great name! The perfect day to release his  birth story. It's the feast day of Saint Victor. ❤🎉 congratulations!
Congratulations!
Welcome, little Victor!  Lisa, I have two daughter-in-laws and when and if they have babies, I am recommending your birth stories to them.  You explain everything so well and help take the fear and mystery out of labor and delivery. 😀😍
Ugh, i had prodromal labor with my last two! It's so hard mentally! My babies have also come 6 days late, 16 days late, and 18 days late, so that didn't help 😅
Congratulations to your family and welcome to Victor!
Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy! Victor is adorable!!
Way past baby stage but can’t help but watch your stories ! A great reminder for me to pray for our future generations! So proud of you sweet momma.. know you have one grandmama praying for you and your beautiful family!
Congratulations, Luke, Lisa and family.  Victor is adorable and at one point in the video, very alert and inquisitive.   He is received into a loving family.  Now, rest.
Congratulations to you all
So happy to hear your beautiful birth story and see yet another gorgeous baby!  Even though it’s been many decades since my youngest was born, your birth videos take me right back to when my own babies were born.  It never ceases to amaze me how perfectly our bodies are made for this.
I want to know what this Christian hypnobirthing app is!! My contractions are always like a minute long and a minute apart... yeah,  I'm lucky I get 10 seconds to try to gather my witts 😅
He is so precious, look at all that hair! Congrats Lisa!!😊♥️
Thank you so much for sharing and talking to the camera like you were sitting down with a friend. Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy! ❤
Well done.  Congratulations
I am in awe at how you manage everything with your births.  Victor is beautiful.  He was a nice sized baby.  Thanks be to God for a healthy baby!  You are so blessed with all your children.  Rest well and enjoy baby snuggles!!  God bless you and your family!
God has blessed you and continues to bless you beyond measure. He is perfection.
Congrats Lisa! I had prodromal labor too with my daughter and also had a fast labor once it kicked in. Victor is beautiful thanks for sharing!
I’ve been so looking forward to watching another one of your birth stories. I feel that all I see is negative from other people, a positive story is SO refreshing.   I know you had mentioned in a previous video that you didn’t want to go too into depth about the Bradley method as it is controversial. But also that you don’t exactly follow exactly what the book says. Could you share how you alter it, or what works for you?
Thanks for sharing your story and congratulations on your little one! I just had my second 3 months ago and the labor felt way more chaotic than my first. Your birth story gives me hope that my next labor can be more restful. (if God blesses us with more children!)
He's beutiful!!!! Congrats!!!
Congratulations on little Victor! My prodromal labor at 36 weeks cut me off guard because it was my first baby. Baby was born at 39 weeks exactly
Really this post makes you sound like a crazy person. Yes all babies come exactly the same. NO dear. That's not how nature works. I don't know why you women today think they need to share your labor and delivery. We have been doing this for years and years before YOU women did it and never had to whine about it for the public.
Congratulations!  He's beautiful!  I'm glad it went well.  I was 44 when my twins arrived via emergency C-Section.  Now they are 15.
You’re amazing!
You are amazing!!!!!
Love watching all of your birth stories!  Can relate so much with you, with my first Id done a lot of research and prayer and kept myself distracted during labor and even though it was over a couple days, when active labor and delivery happened it was really smooth (and pretty much painless) as Id learned to deeply relax throughout.   With my second I'd been told all throughout pregnancy that it happens so much faster with the 2nd so I was just in my head at the end when labor started. She wasn't in an optimal position and it took longer. Transition was a couple hours for me whereas only 20 mins my first. I definitely want to remember for next time! Stay distracted! And try not to fear or get anxious!
Yay! Congratulations! Praying over your after birth cramps. 💛
Congratulations, I really enjoyed this story. I am new to your channel and have been going through all your older vlogs. I love all of your sourdough starter recipes as it is something i have always wanted to do but was always failing now in my ripe old age of 56 i have done it thanks to your tips. I have made several loafs and my family is now requesting homemade bread yay lol.
Your birth stories are always so wild. Next time call the dang midwife 2 hours before you think you need to. Haha!  Victor is so cute and looks like he may have reddish hair. <3
Congratulations on a lovely birth and having a healthy, beautiful baby! God be with you and your family.
This is so similar to my eighth birth. So happy it went so well. Congratulations!!
Congratulations ❤
I love your birth story, welcome to the family Victor Isaiah! He's adorable! I'm just like you when it comes to pushing, I want it done it done as soon as possible so my babies shoot out real quick ha! Take care, relax and enjoy the newest addition Lisa. We're sending lots of love to you and the family! 🧡💛💚
Congratulations he is beautiful  ❤️🙏❤️
As a homebirth midwife I love this video so much. Your wisdom and confidence is amazing. Congrats to you and your family 💓💓💓
Welcome, baby Victor.  And congratulations to Mommy (Who rocked Labour) and daddy! 🤱
Congratulations ❤
God Bless you and your beautiful family.
Aww Lisa am so happy for you he’s beautiful ❤
Congratulations! 🥳
Congratulations Lisa and family! I wish I had had these videos before I had my kids! I feel I now understand the Bradley method so much better.
I've pulled up on my belly during labor before. It helped my 11 lber (#8 of 9) come out.  I used Bradley with mine and it works great! I did Lamaze with my first (38yrs ago) but ended up naturally doing a lot of Bradley stuff without knowing it lol so did Bradley with the rest.
Congratulations, wonderful beautiful momma and the beautiful baby boy 👶
Congratulations on baby Victor. What a precious blessing. I’m so happy for you and your family.  Thanks for sharing your birth story. It’s encouraging to so many new and expectant mothers.
Congratulations!🎉😊❤️🎊👏
Congratulations Lisa! ❤ Thank you for sharing ☺️ I'm going to check out the Bradley Method for my next pregnancy! Love Victor's name, precious! Enjoy ❤
Wow Lisa! Congrats! Victor is beautiful! I can totally relate. As you speak, I feel like I am reliving my last few births. Prodromal labour is exhausting. So thankful that the LORD is there to sustain us through it all! We have 6 boys and 3 girls, would love more if the LORD sees fit to bless us again! Take care Sweet Momma! Rest up! ❤  PS: My contractions actually stayed at 5-10 minutes apart through my active labour....they never ended up piggy backing like they usually do in the end. I too was reluctant to call my midwife, but had to go with what my body was telling me. Definetly weren't 'textbook' contractions! Lol! Was so bizarre! I always end up with night labour, seems to be my body relaxes after I put my kiddos to bed.😂
Congratulations
Precious momma and baby.❤
❤❤❤ 22:38
This is so lovely, you're an inspiration ❤ I hope i'm lucky enough to be a mother one day, and if that day comes, that I may be as graceful and as strong as you are ❤
Congratulations beautiful video
Congratulations!! Will you be having any more? ❤
HOW WONDERFUL!!!  WELCOME LITTLE VICTOR.  GLAD YOU DID NOT HAVE ANYMORE PROBLEMS THAN YOU DID.  BLESSINGS UPON VICTOR, MOTHER , DADDY AND BROTHER'S AND SISTER'S.
He is Adorable Lisa!! Congratulations on baby #8. I am pregnant with baby #2 and aiming for a home birth this time around so this is a great video to go back on as I get closer to my labor. I wish the pre-dromal labor shortened mine, I was in labor for 46 hours with my daughter. I’m hoping to at least half that time this go round. I went the midwifery birth center route with her.
Congratulations!!! Love your birth stories :) I’m pregnant with #7 and planning my 6th homebirth (had one set of twins at home) and now have baby fever even more after watching your video :)
🥰❤️. Congratulations 🎈🎉
Girl, that brings back sweet memories. I had four of my six babies at home. Thanks for sharing.
Bless you all and thank you Lord for the safe delivery.❤
he is beautiful!! congrats!
Congratulations he’s a cutie!
Congratulations Lisa! Im 40+2 with prodromal labour with baby 6. Trying to be patient!
Congratulations to all and a big Happy Birthday to Victor!👏🥰🎉
Did you end up using the AfterEase for the cramping? I thought you mentioned it in one of your videos so I was waiting to see what you thought before I ordered it for myself
Congratulations 🎈
What was the name of the app? Im pregnant with baby number 3 and i really want to have him without pain releif
Welcome to the world Victor 🍼. He is adorable . ❤️ You are an amazing mother. ❤️
Congratulations ! He is beautiful ❤
HE IS BEAUTIFUL LISA! Congratulations to all of you the kids must be ecstatic ❤❤❤❤❤❤ god bless all of you🙏🏼😭😭
❤
Congratulations!!
You are such a joy to watch.  It brought tears to my eyes. Thank you for sharing and congratulations!
Congratulations!!  Such a beautiful baby and gorgeous bright eyes!
I'm just starting to watch this, but WOAH this is fast. Baby on Monday video on Friday? We don't deserve you! <3
Congratulations!!
Congratulations!❤❤❤❤
Has your sister gave birth to her baby yet? Donna
He is adorable! Does he have a touch of red hair?
Nice story. Are you going to belly bind?
Congratulations!!  I was hysterical during my last labor. My epidural didn’t work, I didn’t want to do it, it hurt, I missed my mum who passed away a year beforehand, I just was so distressed. I don’t even think I could have tried to relax myself. I ended up having to have an extra medication in my epidural and then I couldn’t feel anything at all and was so much happier.  No one ever mentioned to me that the after birth pains would be worse the second time around. They were manageable with Panadol the first time but the second time I was on endone!  Well done to you, I just think you’re magic!
Congratulations Lisa and Luke!!! He's beautiful 💙
He’s so handsome!! Congratulations.
Congratulations!!! So glad you had a good birth, I’m having my 5th baby in December. Ordering that book this time, hoping I can learn to relax through it the way you do.
My second baby I did the same for a good week lol by the weekend leading up to her birth it got bad... my water broke Monday morning we headed to the hospital about 1.5hr later after i realized I had no break between contractions lol we got pulled over on our way but upon looking inside and see my large belly the officer told us to "go and have a good day!" I was 100% effaced and 6-8cm when we arrived lol but she was too large and very stuck and I had to have surgery after having her... needless to say all my pregnancies and labors are high risk for various reasons and I cannot have my babies at home :-( it sound so lovely and peaceful though... ♡♡ My current pregnancy is very high risk and we both have to be monitored wkly starting in 2wks, 32wks along. I'll have five appointments a week until she arrives, most likely early because of our risks. ♡♡ I am so thankful to have been able to have natural births so far though!!
💐💐💐💐🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉
Wow, congratulations, mama. What a beautiful strong name for your newest son. Glad you’ve been resting and the others are so helpful.
"Christian" and "hypno" seem contradictory to me 😂 Congratulations on your precious baby boy! Glad everything went well ❤
Congratulations Lisa, Dad and family!  He is a beautiful baby.  I'm so grateful that all went well.  Thank The Lord Jesus!!!  I am so glad you took the iron pills.  You and Victor are lovely and pink.  He has an amazing head of hair.  Same color as yours, and so thick.   Many prayers and love for continued recovery, health, and blessings for you all.
Congratulations on your new baby, he is adorable, and I give you a whole lot of credit having your babies at home. Take Care and God Bless to you and your entire family.
As someone who had two very quick labours i can't get my head round doing " stuff" while having contractions i went from 0 to 100 , baby 2 took 45mins! But that new baby head and hair gorgeous.
Victor is a good name for a king. He will have a very powerful and magnetic persona. He will be charming and a pleaser and want everyone to be at peace. He’s very attractive, and he’ll develop a very quick and quirky wit and will enjoy being the class/family clown. He is highly intelligent and a gracious speaker. Because his mind is afflicted and overactive, he’ll experience frustration from both parents as they try to mold him. His dad must try not to be particularly harsh with him. He has a enormous will and a strong gut instinct and sensitivity about people and can see beyond the veil; this is his gift. His loved ones should be taught that he just knows things, not to shut him down or deride him for it, or he will separate himself from this gift or keep it to himself. He’s more sensitive that he may appear. Because he won’t feel “seen” by one parent, he will feel the loss of this parent; each one should designate time every day for one on one interaction while they can. The other parent will lavish him and this can create quite an imbalance, the type of imbalance that can lead to npd. Another root of npd is being taught that appearances matter, so go easy on what others may think, as he is unique and ahead of his time. He’ll experience his parents as being very much at odds with one another, so keep fights and arguments at minimum as this can contribute to self destructive behavior. He may experience gut issues that are directly related to anxiety and overthinking. If each of us are born with a God shaped hole in our heart, Victor has a God shaped crater; helping him find his spiritual path will be essential, and accepting his chosen path crucial. He could have an intense love for music and find it a source of healing in his life. He has the capacity to eventually lead a very public life and become a leader in his chosen field as he conquers himself to get there.
This reminds me of how the bible refers to the birth of God's people; Often times it's refered to by a woman in labor. I thought a cool parallel was that no one knows the time the birth will be, just like no one knows when Jesus will come, and it's better that way. You might start worrying about when it's going to happen, at first, but soon that leads you to worrying about if something is wrong, and make you waste unnecessary energy.
Wow God bless you.😊
Thank-you for sharing your beautiful birth story. I wish I were young enough to have that experience again. ❤
Congratulations to you both. Welcome to your beautiful son. I love that your experience was so positive.  Expectant mommas need to hear more positive stories like this.
Congratulations! New follower here. I have been watching Jammerill sing your praises for a very long time so I found your channel a few weeks ago. I wish videos like this were around when I was having my babies. Watching you and Danielle Murray and a few others have these wonderful home births that are mostly peaceful but way more relaxed and calm than my four hospital deliveries, makes me wish I had done things differently. Baby number four was born 6 years ago and the other three are teenagers so they were mostly born before YouTube and my knowledge was expanded. Oh well! That was Gods plan for me and everyone is happy and healthy and that all we can ask for. Sorry for rambling!! I love watching birth story videos and it brings back all the memories. I’m so grateful you have another little blessing to add to your family and I am looking forward to watching the adventures to come!! Rest as long as you can and we will all be here when you are ready to come back. ❤❤❤
Congratulations
Congratulations .  So happy all went well .  Bless you, your new baby as well as the rest of your  family
What a beautiful baby.
You have a beautiful baby.  So happy for you all❤
I love that you share your birth stories. And your precious babies. Blessings
Sometimes we just need to get out of our heads! Learned so much from watching you, thanks for sharing your experience with us 💕
First congratulations 🚙🍼🪁🐳 Victor is beautiful!!!!   Please be carful with meditation, scripture and blowing out dandelions. Satan is very deceiving. I am not saying it didn’t work. You are a wise woman and I would hate for you to put something out there that takes away from scripture. This is out of a ton of respect for you!!
Victor is just precious
Thank you for sharing! I'm very happy for you and liked listening to your thoughts ❤ He is precious!!
Congratulations I love the name.
Congratulations!❤ Something that's saved me with afterbirth pains while nursing is AfterEase by Wishgarden. I don't know if you know about it or not but just wanted to share in case you don't. Best wishes on your postpartum recovery!!
Look at all that hair!!  And Lisa, you look beautiful for just giving birth. 😊
I had an Uncle Victor. He was the kindest man. Full of joy. Welcome you your own Victor.
HAY GIRL , DO U REALISE JUST HOW COOL 😎  U ARE  U TUBER / AMAZING MUM OF 8 🥰😍🤩❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💙💫💥
Congratulations
Oh I am so happy for you!! Love the names we have a Victor and an Isaiah in our home.❤
Congratulations Lisa!🎉 So grateful for you and your beautiful family.❤
Congratulations..Right towards the end of your video.. baby Victor is looking around the room, like..'who is she talking to?' 😄
Your sister had an unassissted birth? I need to k ow more now. I will be trying to look her up. Was it the "our oily house" sister? Or another one? I want an unassissted birth so bad, but I am a little afraid of people opinions. But I am a homeschool mom, so I am used to facing the fire of others opinions😅. So happy you had a fast and peaceful birth. Congrats on the beautiful baby boy! God bless!
Congratulations to you all
You are amazing Moma and Victor is beautiful.
Wonderful story!  Such a precious baby 😊My daughter is due anytime 🙏
Congratulations, he is beautiful
Beautiful birth story, thank you for sharing and he's a beautiful, healthy baby boy! God bless y'all!!
Congratulations! Baby Victor is so beautiful!
Natural, undisturbed, physiological birth. As it should be. No interventions to create a disruption of the natural and safe hormonal processes between mother and babe which cause a cascade of interventions. Congrats!  The nuchal cord is perfectly normal and as long as baby is attached, no worry at all. Also, for future, fundal massage is not evidence based and pitocin leads to more problems and interventions. Unless a hemorrhage is causing symptoms, it is not abnormal at all. Just for anyone learning.
My observation with prodromal labor has always been that it happened when my body was moving the baby into a more optimal birthing position and that's why it all goes so fast in the end because the positioning has all happened.
❤
I am always so encouraged by your birth stories! Im praying for baby number 3 i can have a med free vaginal birth. My first was induction and unexpected C-section, second was so long of a labor (40 hours total, 24 in the hospital alone) pitocin and epidural needed to progress but ended up with a Vbac thankfully with only 35 mins of pushing! I feel like it helped me know better what will help next time to experience an actual vaginal birth and that is to actually practice the position because once in labor i forgot about it and could not relax no matter how i was positioned. I had front, rectal and back labor and that would have helped! Truly ignoring early labor would help as well! So glad that Victor is okay and that you had such a good experience, praise God!
Congratulations! He is so cute! I am praying for a painfree birth also! Due in October with my 6th. Because you push your babies out so fast do they struggle with choking on their amniotic fluid coming up after birth? That’s happened with my last 3 babies and it’s the worst. I push them out so fast that the doctors say they dont get the fluid squeezed out of them enough. Let me know if you have any tips. Love your videos. ❤ God bless you and your family.
Congratulations!
Congratulations he’s so precious! Love ❤ how he slept through his birth story!
awe he is beautiful. Happy Birthday little guy. Thankful all is well. I prayed for you. He is a big little one, yet so little. So precious. Enjoy him and I feel for you with after birth pains. Worse than labor for me. Peace!
Congratulations Lisa and Luke💙
He has a lot of hair😍
Heart congratulations Lisa, Luke and Victor!
Victor is beautiful as all your other babies and children.  Congratulations on your baby boy.  Love those boys😇❤️
Beautiful baby boy and love to hear your birth stories.
Congratulations....such a blessed baby to be born to an amazing mom and a beautiful family!
What a beautiful pair after all that work.  Enjoy your, hopefully quiet time for the next couple weeks. God bless you all.
Congratulations!!! May God bless you!!!
Congratulations 🎊 👏 💐
Congratulations❣️ I love the name...what a blessing❣️
I learned about the Bradley method from you Lisa! My last birth was so amazing, I also didn’t experience pain when I was in the relaxed position! And just like you I never had those close together contractions, but I just knew we were getting to the end. I practiced the sitting up relaxing so I was even able to do it in the car, went through transition on the way to the hospital. The Bradley method is an absolute game changer for labor!
Beautiful baby boy. I'm 34 weeks with my 5th. Unfortunately I'm not able to have any home births. I have to have hospital births.
What an incredible mom you are, you are so blessed for your wonderful family.  Hey you got this. You are amazing. A wonderful mother, wife, sister and role model.
Congrats on your beautiful baby boy.  Just started watching your utube about a week ago and just love your family and way of life.
This is so helpful and beautiful as I'm just a few weeks away from my first baby's due date 😊 I've been experiencing consistent contractions for a couple of days which was making me anxious too! Especially never doing this before, but I can tell it is not the real thing yet. Time to simply surrender and just be at peace for whatever time and way baby wants to arrive!
What an incredibly inspirational story!!! My Mom had 8, 6 girls and 2 boys. Growing up in a large family has it's challenges (amongst siblings) of course and it sure has it's blessings. Holidays, birthdays, any event sitting around the table and talking as a family . Some of my fondest memories of my Mom were the stories she told us around the dinner table. You and Luke are going to have the time of your lives watching each child grow into their own unique personality. I do know that your older children are already developing their unique personalities. Lisa, you are going to be remembered for generations after generation. I love this family of yours. God bless you and Luke and all your kiddos......
Congratulations!🎉
I'm happy for mothers who decide to go natural but because it doesn't harm the baby, I'm not going to suffer. I want to enjoy the birth instead of being focused on the pain.
Im definitely done having babies but i always get a little sad i will never give birth again... I still listen to birth stories, even though i know im done.. lol
Congratulations to all! 🎉❤
Love Christian Hypnobirthing! Used the app for my daughter's birth last year, using it again this year for baby #3. So happy to hear you found it so helpful. Congratulations on little baby boy, he's adorable.
What is the name of the Christian hypnobirthing app?
Congratulations! He's just perfect and you are pretty amazing too.
Congratulations, I am so happy for you! God’s blessings to you ❤ and your family 🎉
Congrats on beautiful Viktor!!!!
I had prodromal labor with my 2nd and 3rd and it really does play tricks with your mindset!!
Congratulations! Beautiful name for a beautiful baby.
Congratulations!
God bless you for sharing the beauty of a loving family life! Congratulations!
Congratulations Lisa! I loved to hear your experience and thoughts on birth as a mom of 8. It’s so helpful as I am in my first pregnancy! Im actually number 8 in my family so I know how blessed little Victor is to have so many siblings and awesome parents as you and your husband. God Bless you all ❤
🤗🤗🤗😄😄😄❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹
Congratulations!!!!! I am so happy for you, baby, and family! ❤
Congratulations on your successful birth of Victor! 🎉🎉 Congratulations to the family, too! 🎉🎉 I love watching your videos.  My father was one of 15.  There was 10 boys and 5 girls which included one set of fraternal twins.
Congratulations!!!!
You look so good!! Bless your family!
Congratulations!!!!! ❤️ Thank you for sharing your birth story.
CONGRATULATIONS ❤You are amazing!  Fever Few tea for serious cramps and migraines.  He’s beautiful and I look forward to all your posts!!! 😊
dude deciding when to ask the midwives to come is sooo tricky! when youre in labor and half in denial and unsure etc. this time my midwife lived 2+hours away and deciding when to have her come was so hard! She made it about 40min before baby though ❤
I am the same way when it comes to pushing. With my second daughter I delivered her all at once. Instead of her head coming out and waiting for another contraction for her to turn slightly and then push her shoulders out I just bore down and shot her out in one go. Needless to say, I tore but I was so done!
That baby looks so relaxed! Congratulations to you & Luke & all the big brothers & sisters. God bless you, little Victor.
Congratulations to everyone!!!!! ❤❤❤
Congratulations! I watch all of your birth stories in my final weeks of pregnancy, every time. Oh man this sounds so much like my 5th birth.  I had a week of prodromal labor.  Called the midwife here twice before labor and even she thought both times we’d have a baby that night.  I was so exhausted and I finally gave up and decided that I was going to be pregnant forever and Id just shut up and live life.  Low and behold my water broke soon after and my midwife barely made it haha.  We had 15 minutes to spare and I had to move into a position to slow labor down as she coached my husband on the phone while rushing here.  She walked in and I was in the middle of the living room floor in very active labor and she said “you can start pushing” and I snapped back with “how do you know!?! (Luckily she has delivered all my babies and we are very close so she didn’t hold it against me but laughed about it).  In my head these contractions were just as hard as all the ones I had been having all week, they were just one on top of the other.  Within minutes baby 5 arrived though this time ❤️
So happy for you and your family! Much love and happiness to you all.
Welcome, Victor Isaiah!! Congratulations!
Thanks for sharing..❤ beautiful baby boy....glad you did well 💕
He is beautiful.  Congratulations
Victor is sooooooooo cute!!!! 🥰🥹and you are glowing with beauty! Your births are so inspiring

Congratulations he’s beautiful ❤
Love this! Congratulations! I love his name and all that beautiful hair! 💙
Praise God for such a beautiful experience! Answered prayer for a day labor, and your precious little one at the end. God is SO good!  This is how I hope to deliver this baby. Calm, relying on God to guide me through, and painless as possible. I wish I could have a homebirth, but i live just a bit too far from the hospital so i will be driving 40min to the birth center.
Congratulations Lisa!!!! 🎉 He is adorable. Wishing you a speedy recovery, and sending prayers of gratitude and blessings for you and your family!!! ❤😊
What a beautiful baby. 😊 wonderful video.
I had prodromal labor with my number four, it caused me to delay my midwife and ended up delivering her about 10 minutes after baby was born because by the time I knew labor wasn't going to stall my water broke  with the next contraction and she started crowning immediately 😅.   Congratulations, so so much Lisa!!? Victor is precious and perfect!
Congratulations!!  Happy for your family!!
Congratulations. He’s just beautiful.
congratulations to you and your family!
Lovely! Victor is handsome baby! Congratulations to you and your family!! And blessing too. ❤ from Spain🍃⚘⚘⚘⚘🍃👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🎀

Congratulations, Victor is gorgeous and you're amazing! ☀️ Would you mind sharing the hypnobirthing app? I have a few weeks until my due date but am getting all in my head about the birth. I'd be grateful for any help 😅
He’s soo cute! So happy for you all. Enjoy all the sweet snuggles.💙🫶🏻
I’ve been so excited to watch this. You look GORGEOUS. Absolutely gorgeous. Congratulations, Lisa! ❤ God is good! I also loved how you described labor as an intensity you have to submit to. There’s some poetry in that.
Congratulations Lisa and family! Victor is beautiful. So happy that you had a great birth and a healthy baby🙂
Victor is such a strong name ❣️ Congratulations he's beautiful!
PRECIOUS ❤❤❤
He’s so cute
Congratulations! Wishing you and yours love, joy, and good health❤
Congratulations!
Thank you for sharing. Victor is so handsome. You look amazing. God bless!
I just had my 3rd babe at home almost 2 months ago now and had prodromal labor for about a week before she arrived (exactly 41 weeks 😅) it was brutal and had a lot of anxiety about it too! My labor ended up being 8 hours total with about 2 hours of active labor. Half of labor was just going through dinner time,  watching a movie and bedtime with my family, It was beautiful and hard and everything I needed❤   Love hearing your birth stories and sharing your life!
Congratulations! That’s basically what I did with my youngest having her first baby. I watched her very closely, told her concentrate on your breathing and I’ll gently touch you wherever I see you tense up. I’d just gently touch with my fingertip any area she’d tighten up and she’d relax . It went great. Both subsequent births were Caesarian. Her boys were both over 11 pounds and she could not physically deliver them. Enjoy that beautiful boy!
I'm only a few weeks away from my due date with my fifth. This is exactly the video I needed to see!! Congrats mama, what a beautiful baby. I have been praying for a daytime delivery too!
Congratulations!!!!!!!
Congratulations to all he's adorable!!
Thank you very much for sharing everything with us! You are amazing and I highly appreciate finding you online! Welcome to the world adorable Victor!
Congratulations!  Welcome, little Victor! So happy for all of you and wish you all the best  - joy, happiness and good health always!

What a blessing mama! Congratulations. And thank you so so much for sharing your wonderful birth stories. I am at 35 weeks with my 3rd little one. 3rd natural birth and I am so excited!
Congrats on baby Victor!  What an adorable baby and name. ❤
Victor is a beautiful little boy.  Lisa, you are a remarkable woman.  I don’t know how you do all that you do.   I hope Victor is a good baby and you get some rest.  Congratulations!
I love this! You're a rockstar. God is good
Comgratulations on such a gorgeous little Boy!!
My doula said that baby number eight is the magic number where you will bleed more and have those cramps afterwards when you haven’t before. She had eight and almost had to go to the hospital, but her emt friend was there and knew what to do. There is a name for it I believe, but it escapes me. Your midwife would know. Just keep track of those cramps. Such a beautiful boy and birth story. Congratulations! 🎉
Beautiful baby! Congratulations! He's so bright eyed. my boys had as much hair. One was a red head and the other brunette! again Congratulations!!.
I am so glad you are sharing these birth stories.  I had four, all of my labors were pretty quick (except our last who turned sunny side up during labor).  The petocon was a life saver for me.  I hemorrhaged with our first two, with our third they induced and turned the petocin up after delivery, and the same with our fourth.  You look amazing after your eighth birth.  And I love his name!
God has made the female body in such an amazing way. I only have two babies, but each birth experience is unique and such a blessing.  My mom has six babies, and with one of us, she was literally cleaning her stove with a towel under her because her water had broken. Lol.
Congratulations on your new bundle of joy 💙💙💙
Congratulations on your new baby boy. He is adorable.
You look positively radiante❤️
Congratulations and God bless your growing family 🙏.
He is adorable,congratulations!
Congratulations. I know it's early to ask but now you have 8 kids do you have an idea if there will be another ?
Beautiful,  precious baby!!  Praise be to God🙏❣️
I've been waiting for you to share the good news. It sure is a happy day when a new baby arrives! He looks like a nice armful of sweetness!💋💕Congratulations to you and your husband!
Congratulations with your new baby boy. From Namibia
🥰 aww sha toot, congratulations 🤗
Congratulations to you all! Welcome sweet Victor 🥰
Congratulations, dear Lisa. You are the best! Taake good care of yourself.
Welcome to the world, Victor! Congratulations! During which birth would you say that the distraction method started? I was not able to distract myself during my second labor, but maybe next time!
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
Congratulations!!! He's precious❤  Thank you for sharing, this was beautiful.

Congratulations on another beautiful baby! Take care of yourself and sweet little Victor!
Beautiful Victor (victory) I love the Bradley method. I am 70 yrs old and had 3 of my babies using Bradley. I also used to be a doula and teach the method. It's amazing!
Will you be doing a 24 hours with baby video? Curious how you do it all with other children and a household to keep up with. You are a rockstar mama!
Congratulations!
Loved hearing your birth story. Blessings and congratulations to you all!!! 🤍
Congratulations 🎉your baby is beautiful. I am so glad you can do this with little discomfort. I had my children during the "natural" childbirth method in the 70's There was nothing natural about it. Haha so I love to hear happy stories like yours❤
Congratulations toy and  your family!  Welcome Victor Isaiah 💙
❤️😘❤️😇😇🌷🌹👍🏽🥰🌈☀️

Congratulations! Thank you for sharing him and your labor with us.
Congratulations
Congratulations to you and family.  So very happy for all of you.
I have been praying for you and your family.  I am so thankful everything is wonderful!
Congratulations family!  I have so been looking forward to this video. Love watching yours and Laura's birth stories.  Victor is so precious❤!  Love the hair.  Lisa and Luke plus 8. 😊
He’s so precious! I also have very bad after birth pains. I only have 3 children and I noticed after each birth they got worse. But that’s probably the thing I hate the most about it all. My third birth I had him in the hospital but literally all natural after having been induced the first 2 it was amazing! I’m so thankful I got to experience it naturally! Again he is so precious! Congratulations to you and Luke and your family!❤
Congratulations again Lisa! He’s so beautiful!!! You make me want 4 more babies! What an inspiration you are to so many women, being an advocate for a peaceful, painless birth. The power of prayer and love is evident. Thank you for sharing your incredible experience. ❤ wishing you a fast and restful recovery.
Congratulations. He is precious. I am so happy for you and your sweet family.
Congratulation❤❤ Blessings to all
your makeup is so pretty, Care to do a video on that, PLease and Thank you
Oh man, waiting around for labor is THE WORST, I totally agree about that!! Everyone was sure I was going to go early with my second and I didn’t realize how much I was holding to that till I ended up going 2.5wks past due 🤪 won’t be doing that again!!
Congratulations Lisa and Luke your an amazing mama 😊❤
This is so me, I carry on right up until its go time. Its the best coping method for me for sure. You rock Lisa! Enjoy your first weeks with your sweet new bundle. ❤ Praying for quick healing and for those pesky cramps to dissipate.
Congratulations Lisa!! Love his name!! He is so dear...!!!
beautiful picture you two make.
I had prodromal labor with my second, and it is exhausting! You get yourself worked up thinking this is it, then it’s not!  Congratulations! Glad you have a healthy baby boy!
I love how beautifully he’s just sleeping in your arms as you tell the birth story! Baby fever is so strong as I am currently 32 weeks with baby #5 and planning our next home birth as well ❤
Congratulations!! He is beautiful!!
Congratulations
Congratulations! What a very wide eyed and alert baby. Good to see you looking so well.
I also prepared shephard's purse tincture for postpartum bleeding in case I was giving birth at home with no help in 2021. (I wasn't sure if I would have a job/insurance due mandates at that time.) I tear with each delivery, so I was concerned about hemorrhaging. Shephard's purse tincture is supposed to work within a minute (vaso constrictor). Worth looking into, perhaps.
I had prodromal labor for a week with my first! Ended up having a c section. Currently 7 months pregnant with my second praying for a vbac and I'm nervous I'm not gonna know when *real* labor starts 😅
i just started watching your beautiful life i’m going back to past videos God bless you and your family ❤️
He is beautiful, congratulations on a beautiful healthy baby boy.
Congratulations!! You are an Inspiration!!!
God bless you all….
Congratulations!  He is so precious.

Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy! The name Victor is so lovely ❤️ wishing you a smooth recovery 🥰
You look amazing mama!!! So full of joy and peace!!! Welcome to the world sweet baby!!
Beautiful baby & birth story.
Prodromal labor is 100% for the birds. This last birth I had this past December was ridiculous with that! 😂 I was definitely irritated and thought I was in actual labor because I had not experienced that with my other births! Im absolutely going to try the Bradley method this next birth in January. 😅 My pregnancies and labor do sound tremendously similar to yours so I’m hoping this Bradley method will help.
Congratulations to you and your family!
What a beautiful baby boy! Congratulations!! My goodness, you are so brave and do so well delivering your sweet babies. Best wishes. Rest up and have a wonderful time with sweet Victor.
Welcome to the world, Victor.    May God keep his hedge of protection around you for life.
I love listening to these birthing stories. I actually watched most of Leslie’s. My natural births were stolen from me by big medicine. I love the fact that you’ve been able to do home births. I know I could have done it. I’m not angry about it anymore, I just try and encourage other women. Our bodies were created for this. My cousins wife recently gave birth. I coached her through the entire pregnancy. Last minute she got scared and went to the hospital. I told her not to let them pressure her or make her afraid. I told her to refuse pitocin or she’d end up in an emergency C-section. She was in the hospital for less than 8 hours before they convinced her. Then 3 hours later they told the the cord was around the babies neck and they had to go get him out. She wasn’t even 3 vm dilated. Her entire birthing story is so traumatic she’s experiencing ptsd. It’s so sad. I pray that women will take back their God given right to give birth naturally without fear. We were fearfully and wonderfully made ‘For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well” (Psalm 139:13-14 Congratulations Lisa. I believe the Lord is allowing me to heal through watching you do what I missed out on. God Bless you and your beautiful growing family. God is good!
Congratulations ❤🎉🙏🙏🙏 especially because CPS and our medical services hate when we do this 😢
Heartily congratulations 🎉 God bless you
Congratulations!!! <3
Congratulations 🎉❤
Wow!! He looks like you!!! CONGRATS!!
Lord let it be for my next baby hahaha 🙌🏼
Congratulations.  Baby Victor is beautiful.
Congratulations to you & your husband on another beautiful blessing from God.  I love your choice of Victor, it is one of our family names.
Lisa you look great and baby is so healthy.  Blessings and prayers for your recovery and congratulations 🎉
Congratulations! So sweet 💓
I've been anticipating this video.........im so happy that you had such a positive experience. Congratulations to you and your Family with another beautiful blessing
Congrats guy's, how wonderful to have a new brother in the family. Well done. Rest up now and enjoy him. Take care
I cannot imagine making a video 3 days after giving birth!   If you felt like you had to- I'm sure none of your subscribers would have minded you taking your time with your newborn. And anyone who does mind isn't worth keeping around anyway.   If you did it just because you wanted to - that's great! I'm so glad you wanted to share this story so much and recovered so well that you could!
Congratulations! He's beautiful and a precious blessing from God! Thank you for sharing your experience and his birth story.
Congratulations Lisa! Love all that hair on Victor. 😍 I enjoy these stories so much.
Congratulations! Your precious eternal being is beautiful! LORD bless you and your family!♥️
Expecting my first, have been watching you for about two years while dating, getting married learning to be a homemaker, learning NFP and planning for our first baby. Needless to say Lisa, I have been SO excited for this video. Congratulations. May God Bless Your Family Continually! Yay Victor! 🕊️
Lift and tuck! Works wonders!
Sweet baby!!! Thanks for sharing your birthing story. 🩵

Congratulations
Congratulations on your beautiful baby boy! Been waiting for the birth video! 🎉
I’ve been waiting for your latest birth story. He is such a beautiful baby and I love his name!! ❤
Congratulations …another beautiful child to a beautiful momma. Cannot wait to watch him grow up and see a video of the other kids meeting him💞
Lovely, I have been looking forward to this day. Birth is an amazing time. Congratulations Victor and family.
The miles circuit is no Joke! I did that with my last pregnancy, and went into labor within 12 hours, two days past my due date.. It was a fast labor and quick delivery.. Was it the miles circuit? Maybe..
Gefeliciteerd met jullie mooie jongen 😘
Oh Lisa what a wonderful video! ❤
Victor is beautiful! Congratulations!
Victor is beautiful!  Congratulations to your family on the newest addition.
Congratulations Lisa. Hats off to you. You have 8 kids. You manage all of them well.
So thankful you’re okay and baby Victor is okay and healthy! “be fruitful and multiply” Praise the Lord!! 😀
Congratulations ❤️
Congratulations!!! It would be interesting to see if there's been an increase in prodromal labor since 2020. I had prodromal labor for the first time with our third baby in 2021. He was also my first L&D that used pitocin pre-birth to speed up contractions  (they kept getting down to 6 minutes apart, then wouldn't progress). First baby was 7-8ish hours L&D. Second baby was 2 1/2 hours L&D (I still had energy and wasn't tired after her birth 😂). Third baby was 33 1/2 hours 😮.
Congratulations!!! It makes me smile, I started following your channel when I was preparing to have my 2nd child in 2019 with your home birth stories and labor techniques. Then I've gone on to have a baby every 2 years since, my next one (4th boy) is due in November and I've been following you along with all of your new additions, plus fabulous recipes and homemaking. God bless you and your family! You are an inspiration.
Congratulations! He is precious
I love how you said “I had nothing to be afraid of!” Such a rockstar momma! ❤️
❤
Congratulations and Blessings from the Lord over you all lovely! 🕊🌿🌄🫶🏻🩷

Congrats!   Yes prodromal labor is... not my favorite. Had it with all 3 kids. I was in prodromal labor everyday starting at the same time in the morning (1am) for a week--the week of Thanksgiving. BUT my labor after my water broke was maybe 4 hours and I arrived at the hospital at 7cm. VBA2C!!!
