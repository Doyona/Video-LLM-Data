Hey brothers and sisters, I love y'all and it's just been in my heart today to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I'm not trying to force anything on anybody or even force to do something they don't. Everyone has their own choice whether to read or ignore this message. But I'm sending this message to all out of love, because if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her because you love her and if you didn't, it show that you don't love her. So I do the same thing for us about the Wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He knew us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready friends, for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him Back. There are so many signs that Jesus is coming back, I don't know what else I can say but Heaven is real, Hell is real, so is this World coming to an End, is real. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back. I love you guys and Jesus loves you too and if you're reading this or even if you ignore this I'll be praying for you because you you are precious, special and valuable and loved by Christ Jesus. Now, there is still time to turn To Christ, it's doesn't matter how great or how small your sin is, He is always ready to forgive with open arms, because He loves you so much. He can also take away all the pains, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, depression, heart brokenness and so much more if you believe in Him. Nothing can separate us from His unconditional love towards us✝️❤️. Be blessed and be encouraged in the Lord Jesus Christ 🙏❤️  How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin.   Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior. Amen  Spreading the Gospel on every content on YouTube 🙏❤️.
im watching this guy instead of Hulu from now on
I always felt that meteorologists love giving us bad news. In fact when the weather is calm and nothing major is happening they seems disappointed and bored!
I love how they were way off
I person on the news telling the truth?? Haven’t seen that in a while.
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self🎈
ELSA OMG SHES COMING I LOVE ELSA I NEED HER AUTOGRAPH 😍😍😍😍
Today it was sunny and now I hear thunder like ? 💀😭🙄
Bruh, I live in Missouri why is this recommended to me? 😂
He is the only news or meteorologist I listen to because he always tells the truth and doesn't go for the drama. Goes for the facts. Living in Florida for so many years I'm so over the dramatization by the people and the media. Denis Phillips rocks
Me YOU REALLY SHOULD GOVE YOURSELVES A AROUND APPLAUSE FOR STANDING LIKE IT OKAY AND I DONT KNOW THATWAKING UP TO MUCH GOING ON IN THIS FUCKIN ROOM FOR ME... I AM WAKING UP LOOKING LIKE ot.alrihh I BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE I AM MOT GOING THROUGH THIS AGAIN......
This is how you meteorologist. No BS, No Drama, Just Facts.
you know meteorologists are serious when the jacket comes off!
Elsa, when are you going to let it go?
Do you think the HFB will be closed in the 5am time frame?
I'm in st Pete currently 8pm tue July 6. Looks like the eye is coming right over us😱
🙏🏾😇🙏🏾😇🙏🏾🙏🏾😇🧚🏾‍♀️
Straight to the point, layman's terms, and well detailed. Thank you, sir!
i always confused "warning" and "watch" until i came up with this.... first they tell you to "watch" for it, then they say "we warned you!" i never confuse them anymore!! 🤗
Miss him!  We moved to the other side of the state over 2 years ago.  He is the best!  When  Charley came through he was the only one who said it was going to come in at Punta Gorda/Port Charlotte area.  He knows the Tampa Bay Area like nobody else.
Another great report Dennis, as usual, You explain it so well so everyone can understand, Thank you Sir.
By far the BEST coverage and makes us ready and reassured on a level of their knowledge!
SATAN (ALSO KNOWN AS DEVIL OR LUCIFER)  IS EXPOSED!!!!! Hell was created for Satan and his fallen Angels(Matthew 25:41 AND 2Peter 2:4).Satan and his fallen Angels fought God’s angels to overthrow God but were defeated and were thus thrown out of heaven to the earth(Isaiah14:12-14 AND Revelation 12:7-10).Satan and his fallen Angels will be thrown into hell to be tormented 24/7 for ever and ever(Revelation 20:10 AND Jude 1:7).Satan and his fallen Angels want you to join them suffer in hell even though you were not part of the coup makers(Revelations 20:10-15).Satan, and for that matter his fallen Angels stand condemned by God and hence do not have any chance of repentance(John 16:11).Fortunately, you and I have up to minutes before our death to repent just like the criminal on the right side of Jesus on the cross (Luke 23:39-43) WHY NOT REPENT NOW AND GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS?Since you don’t know how and when you will die, my brother or sister, THE TIME TO REPENT IS NOW AND GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS!!!
Honestly the suspenders got me here. Happy I clicked
I love this forecaster .So realistic.
But very good explanation about what the wind speed and what it mean . Best I have seen it caused me to subribe
You have it as a cat I when Tampa offices say it will stay a tropical storm you need to be more accurate
Out of Tampa jan
Yes thank you so much for getting to the point I absolutely love this guy he gives a good weather report he just gets right to the point honest doesn’t beat around the bush thank you so much😁🥰👍
I like this dude!
He is without a doubt the best meteorologist on the planet!  He doesn't feed off fear of the viewers, he gives us the truth and nothing but the truth!!!  THANK YOU DENIS!!!!
OMG BRO ⛈🌧 🌧🌩🌩⛈⛈🌧🌧🌧🌧
"Take this out of our show, we dont' need spaghetti models anymore'  - Expert talk
But mobile homes go down the interstate at 70 all the time
Lol he forgot his jacket
We love you! Watch you everyday 💓
Your a good teacher ! Richard Jr.
DENIS is the truth! I like the way gets down to business.
90mph isn't much different then 100mph, until you're in the batters box.
I'm not sure,,the fear mongering is not really up to speed..im not sure what to think about it.
I hope this guy doesn't get fired for telling the truth.
Denis "The Weather Boy" Phillips
I really like this guy. He is not alarmist.
9:11 I know Polk County isn't in the dark blue color, but will it get the effects from Elsa?
Remember when Alena stalled in 85?
I see now why everybody likes this guy no sugarcoating straight to the point and detailed descriptions he’s good at what he does (edit: subscribe and thanks for the support)
You guys need to upgrade that camera, from "Potato 9" to "Potato X"
"never trust a man who can't even trust his own pants."
This guy is good!  No super danger drama!  Thank you sir 😊
OMG a rational, non hysterical non hypey  news report! This guy ROCKS
Plot twist: he down plays it heavily, it becomes CAT 4
Great job, Denis! I will be watching your updates tonite.
Canny explanations. I appreciate his forecast.
I Don’t like this guy he talks like he is speaking to 5 year olds
EXCELLENT METEOROLOGIST!!!!!
He definitely keeps it honest, thank yoh
He is the best, tells us the truth while I feel like the others are hoping for a major event.
He is the best meteorologist.
I remember when he called the eastward jog in Charlie first. I real pro
What a blowhard this guy is,probably a Yankee without any clue of hurricane behavior. It's too early in the season to be taken seriously, now if it was August and this thing it were to be spooling up then I would be worried. Typical over educated parrot speaking  beyond his ability. What a maroon!.
Good luck Florida
I like his suspenders. You can trust a guy who wears suspenders. :-)
Charley was coming up the coast until he made a sharp right turn over Sanibel. None of the models allowed for this possibility. Beware rapid change in direction
This guy needs acting lessons
man this dude was excellent..just lay it straight out ..xoxoxo
58 year resident of Florida and Dennis is the best I've seen 👌
I'm down in Big Pine Key and Tampa Bay severe thunderstorms are much worse! Not a twig on the ground here but much needed rain☺
Thank you for detailed explanation of this storm. It really helps, native or not. I'm a whole life native and still appreciate the info.
After dozens of hurricanes, this is the most under hyped verbage I have ever heard.
WOW! Never seen this guy before Love his honesty and no sensationalizing real info is what we need. I've been here since 1983 Naples and Altoona, Lived through Andrew, Charley, Wilma, Irma, Francis "who hit us 4 times" This is a tropical storm Not a hurricane. Thank you for your honest in depth assessment.
I agree with other commenters. This is a REAL weatherman. Best info so far. Tells the truth with no hype. The facts I was looking for.
This guy is a full on con artist
Love his colorful, yet pinpoint and exact explanation. This is my first time watching and I don't even live in the area; I'm in Palm Beach County. I wish he could moonlight as a weatherman over here!
Dennis is theee best Meteoroligist !!!!!
Love this guy, I listened to him all the time when I had a TV, he is right on, thanks Denis 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙋 St.Petersburg area
A first class meteorologist!👌❤️
Just cloudy in Sarasota right now
The most honest, intelligent forecaster I’ve seen in a long time!
We have one JUST LIKE YOU here in Big Bend! We appreciate you guys! Not a lot around like ya! You & Rob Nucatola!
Let's get this passed us already!
We must learn ,, is to  don't stress over  what we ave  no control,,be safe and trust The almighty creator
👏👏👏 Absolutely the best meteorologist!
Wow! You are AWESOME!!! Thank You for explaining so well! ❤️❤️❤️ I’m in big bend but have family in your area!
Great info! Truth telling and facts, no drama! Thank you!
Very good meteorologist! Great job Denis! Thank you!
Everybody needs to forget about this bullshit and just get back to work
Landfall appears pointed at the Waccasassa preserve where only alligators live
Left out of these reports is what will be done for the survivors of this storm.  That said my thoughts and prayers go out to the West Florida coast residents as they survive (we all hope) this storm.
Nice Tie Sir.
Hurricane season, when news people get paid by the word.
The best weathermen. Seriously explained everything
I am forever shouting TACO WARNING whenever we have finished making tacos
Denis is straight shooter.  Only guy to listen to.
Most the Most Accurate Meteorologist in the Country.
I like the way this Meteorologist explains everything... just a go to the point and I like it that way...
I like the way this guy does his job
Goood bless alll lf you guys
Ugh I’m not used to listening to the news when they are not fear mongering
Denis is the best!
He is the only news or meteorologist I listen to because he always tells the truth and doesn't go for the drama. Goes for the facts. Living in Florida for so many years I'm so over the dramatization by the people and the media. Denis Phillips rocks
He is SO helpful!! Others could learn from his common sense approach and clear explanation of the situation at hand.
Great job.  Best report out of all the other weatherman in tampa. 👍💪🌴
