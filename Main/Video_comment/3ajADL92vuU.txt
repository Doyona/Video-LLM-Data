if you put a **** in minute 5:00 youtube shuts down for ever 😅
This is where Becca broke her ankle lmfao
I think you might have missed Ali spagnolia. I could be wrong.
Are you and crackhead tazerguy friends or rivals?
the grandma using the sewing machine right after what appears to be a dji with legs
Mehdi's daughter plays "Yo vs el Presente" in piano.
This is how to convert from ft/s unit to miles/h unit: 1 ft/s = (1*0.3048) m/s = (1*0.3048*3.6) km/h = (1*0.3048*3.6/1.609344) miles/h = 15/22 miles/h = 0.681818181 miles/h(approx.)
I recognized way more makers than in Youtube Rewind
🫡🫡🫅🫅🫅🫅💯💯💯 hi sir!
Others : hey Electroboom : just brings the camera close to their face 😅😅
No nilered 😢
CORRIDOR CREW <3
I love how he is passing by like all maker youtube and stuff with lasers, 3d printers and so and then there there is just a 150 years old steam engine with a 150 years old woman using it to sew
My fomo just went crazy watching this lol, PLEASE tell me this will happen again next year.
3:57 People sewing?
so many cool people in one place!
6:18 when you can build a self playing piano but can’t tune some strings
It's like a meetup of good-natured evil villains
6:55 What is the name of this theme?
Damn even Peter Brown was there geez
Omg is James of TheOdd1sOut
I hardly see @NileRed in these sort of videos. Why?
Can't wait for this years update!
You should of tested marks outlits
This is AMAZING
*Casually uses the handheld electronic interference device near everyone's complicated inventions*
Holy cow! So much inventors in one place!!!
>electrecutes random people >Best event of the year!<😮
Where is michael from vsauce when you need him
I wish I can meet all of you guys :)
ah was so good seeing everyone 2024❤ really cool meeting everyone at the booths and getting autographs and just it felt friendlier than an different con I've been to it's like pretty memorable thanks everyone even just con goers for making it as amazing as possible ❤
@codebullet face leak
Sheldon cooper would be so proud 😅😅
2024 you going???
Amazing. Its like the Avengers united ...
4:14 This is like Youtube's Dangerous Inventions Avengers holy moly
Ahh yes a panel of the most dangerous creators, thank you for the watch list
Remembered the seen from Tomorrowland movie where in a scene,  all The creative minds came
Michael reeves jumpscare
This is quite a ‘shocking’ video
If your girlfriend thinks you're cheating 3:13
4:14 legendary lineup right there
if all of these creators worked together on one entire project i wonder what the project would be like or what would happen.
my favorite part was allen pans legs
I don't think code.Bullet has done a fake surveil has he
Seeing StyroPyro and CodyLabs on here was so awesome and the other creators as well! I can safely say i never imagined how much videos I’ve seen from all of them and to be together, i would be fainting again and again  Edit: NILERED CAME TOO!?!?
Which one is their handler I wonder.
Basically my sub list
damn. all my fav creators! time to go beg my mother to buy tickets for 2024
Everyone I follow. At one place. Getting zapped.
ElectroCUTE got tall...Man how fast time went by. "You call this a robot?"-"It's much better then the cellphone you tried to fix" 😂
So awesome to see Cody's lab there.
i like how michael reeves likes electrocuting people and electro boom electrocute himself and there in the same room together
The fuck do you mean "hi"? What happened to "greetings, fellow electrifiers"?
Cool to see hes a fan of the same guys as me
i hope it's an act they don't know electroboom
wow what a meeting, i wish i was there!
Man i assume that was actually Robo Cody. Since "codys lab" is living in his "Rover"
Holy shit... a ton of youtube cool nerds in one convention... AWESOME :D
Olha lá o Mark rober
I love how you say you're such a big fan when you're clearly just as famous 😂
lol I was in the circle that got shocked, that was awesome. Nice meeting you!
didnt know bout that till this vid but hoping to go next year and to be shocked by the great electroboom
MY  IDOL... DIODE GONE WILD is missing 🤠🤠🤠
EXCELLENT !!! 😅👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼... tank you very much for the partage..
Oh man, this looks like it was soooo cool. Im pissed i couldn't go, this is what i love seeing and just looking at. I recognized/religiously watch at least half of the people you pointed out
I wanna meet ElectroBOOM.
6:03 lol
you shocked me on the boat
When’s the next event?
jfc the amount of talent and knowledge in this video...
So many great content creators, so little time...
The jazz was a nice touch 👍
wow the Thought emporium WAS there !
I love that we are in a world where we recognize famous people who actually do cool stuff instead of celebrating people who have nothing but a big ass or people who have nothing but a talent on chasing a ball in a field.
I'm sad I couldn't go. Stupid bills. Looks like it was an awesome time, though!
😂 Really amazing our science fairs are nothing in front of this event 🎉😊
With that tons of engineers and fabricators im not surprised if they can make a space shuttle themselves
Didn't expect to see Anthony Fantano here 3:18.
jesus christ I wish I could have gone to this. This has to be the largest group of the coolest creators ever. It must have been surreal even for all of you guys to be there together like that.
So friendly and comfortable atmosphere ❤
CODE BULLET!?
แหล่งรวมหัวกะทิ
What an amazing event. Some of the most amazing and inspiring minds on youtube in one place? Sounds like the best dream ever lol.
PLEASE tell me this will happen again in the northeast
Damn, I don't think I've ever been so envy. To hang out with so many creative weirdos would be the most comfortable environment for me.
a coil gun not a rail gun😅, its still a rail gun it launches projectiles exactly the same way
so wild to see wren there, but I guess it makes sense. He was always the engineer of corridor.
OH GOD ITS WHEATLEY
I'm telling my kids that these were The Avengers
1:05 legs for snakes  MADE MY YEAR !!!😂😂
5:26 code bullet face reveal sneak peek (unless he had released one already)
Cant beleive you met jennifer lawrence
great to see such a variety of youtubers coming together
8 minutes of ElectroBOOM assaulting other youtubers would be a more fitting title
Cheers all of the Persians
WTF so manny YouTubeers 😂 Last vidio i sawn was an Dude whiche Put 100 Car baterries in series and tryd to Pop Gigant Bolts  there was som arcing to 😂😂
Really good video. Colin Furze was there as well !. Glad you labelled lots of people, this lead to some great tangents and videos that I later followed.
4:14 my dream come true... they all must make a video or multiple together... it's like the avengers or justice league of science
That looked like awesome fun.
Bro literally half of my subscription list is in one room together hahahahahaha
That moment, when the panel of the most dangerous creators is literally just all of my favorite YouTube creators...  I feel like The King of Random is there in spirit...
I'm kinda bummed I forgot all about opensauce coz of college until just now. Kinda surreal recognizing about 90% of the people who're labelled here.
I recognized so many creators! Simply beautiful.
very fitting styro pyro is in the center that man is a MAD SCIENTIST
this is a greater crossover than infinity war
How are you doing ElectroBOOM?
crossover event of the century
Everyone else: Brings the gift of cool gadgets and gizmos Mehdi: Brings the gift of painful electric shocks
من اون کامنت ایرانی هستم❤
1:11 LOOK AT THIS GUY
Well done, perfect length for a recap. Many others are way too long....
Wowaa did he just mentioned CODE BULLET ❤❤❤
freedom units 😂😂
This event should have been government sponsored as It is good for the kids and adults as it is a positive environment good for the mind
So many ppl I’ve heard of and watch and so many i haven’t yet wow
WOW SO FUN!!!
Damn, those were almost all of the most epic creators on youtube in one building
did not expect to see code bullet
Ok, Styropyro is still alive....
What will be your avg montly elctricity bill......😨😨
6:55
man, seeing many of the creators there at one place, i was going nuts reading who was there. I watch most of them all the time. Cool event.
zzzZZZZ
You missed Wren from Corridor Digital! 6:52
Robby!!!!!!!
The intro already got me💀
Mark Rober really needs to upgrade his warehouse fire alarms.  Those beasts are probably older than me
I know this place. It's a secret place I watched the videos he introduced. Now watching the videos you shot is amazing. wish i could go there it was so fun
sickest crossover episode ever
this is like watching wolverine going to comic-con and fanboying on all the other hero's
Where is I did a thing 😂
I really wish I could’ve made it. Open sauce looks like so much fun! I hope they can do another one.
Can I please have a 3-D printer for free? Please
I liked that Chess one, it will shock you if you Blunder, Miss, and Mistake, It will shock you the most if you Blunder, Mistake shock is higher than Blunder, and Miss is just normal shock 😂
Beautiful Sir, Beautiful ;)
his daughter goes to my school
I only knew peter stripol... Who's the best creator of the bunch?
This makes me want to go to open sauce so bad next time
I got to play with that wand when we shot CYSTM S2 which I believe it was made for? boy is it fun. Floating Mylar with it was fun you can pass it back and forth like the force
i am interested in these types of experiments so please which branch to choose mech or electrical (ONLY) or electronics and elctrical ( EEE)
I.. recognised nearly everyone?? Holy fuck what an event
So pretty much an engineer con, few to no cosplayers in sight...
wow this convention looks amazing
Thanks for the tour! (Seeing Osman didn't bother!!😂😂)
Where’s Simone Getz
wait where's NileRed? I didn't see him
STYROPYRO FTW
We love a good willy Osman
🤯
Insane... I recognize all of these  people, I MEAN ALL OF THEM, send help, it seems my social life has been unknowingly  alt+f4d
ElectroPaparazzi
I might be off topic here but the fact that he could break most of the tech there with his magic wand kind of scares me 😅😂
Wow! Such an amazing gathering of creativity and brilliance!
https://youtube.com/shorts/h9m1HmxVsvY?feature=share
holy sheee Michael Reeves is alive lol. Man we dont get to see enough of him. Cool Cody made it there too :D
Was that 404??? ill never tell.
You know you've been on this area of youtube for a long time when you recognize 90% of the people here. Awesome
Super awesome to meet you at the event, as well as so many other creators!! Thanks for being awesome :)
Man I would love to go next year!
Furze and Drake? We're going to die
Dude, so many of my favorite creators lol
You didn't shock Michael Reeves? He's totally into that!
Build things!
this is litteraly my dream wtf i need to be there
This man goes to fairs and swings his wand around, respect!
It was awesome to see creators like Styro and Cody included, nice to see everyone is so friendly together.
I hope to be able go the next time around... Looks like a blast.
its a whos who of damned near EVERYONE i follow!!! I wanna go and have a booth next time!
Wow that creator party was insane
great to see codys lab and styro pyro in the video
W community
8 minute video, 30+ hours of editing in peoples names... :P haha
So cool, the room chalk full of talent.
I guess make up artists do a lot of work if they can turn Jennifer Lawrence from that into a star...
steam powered sewing?
I didn't really understand how many science YouTubers would ACTUALLY be here until I saw this. I'm genuinely surprised to see just how many if this people are here. Truly a culmination of all the work people on this site has done!
Best video about opensauce I’ve seen so far
when all of them went on that Panel and saw they would be on stage with Mehdi they knew they were getting shocked.
HOLY SHYT CODE BULLET PagMan
Adult science fair seems gas
Styropyro, Electroboom, and the Hacksmith. Yes
Wtf, got some plasma vortex something rather video notification, then video says private. Don't tease us:/
New video is private?
Why the new video was done private 🥲
From India👍👍👍👍
"Plasma and Salt Water Electric Vortex, Document Free Energy Clean Up" ... where did it go? i clicked on it and it's gone. now it is gone from my feed as well
I can't believe Medhi, Styropyro, and Colin Furze were in the same room together and nobody died
I got a electroboom video notification were is it
What was that new upload? I saw a title but couldnt click it
I want an Mehdi and Grady crossover 0:51 !!
Its like all my childhood makers in one place that's nuts
Physics Girl Dianna would have loved to be here :(( Get well soon, princess!
If I could attend this, I would do it every time😢. It's amazing😊❤
why is it called open sauce and not open source?
only come here to check if this man still alive Lol
To you reading this Jesus can help with whatever problems, hardships, and issues you have. Please I'm not asking you to become a Christian or to give up your life because that's wrong or this is wrong. NO I'm just asking you please consider Jesus. He rescued me from my pit and he can yours.  Jesus Christ, son of God, died for our sins, was buried, and rose again on the third day After he went to his tweleve disciples and many others before ascending into heaven eternally triumphant over all his enemies and making it so that there is now no condemnation for sin to all those who believe, but only everlasting joy.   To all reading this christ is the way the truth and the life
Can't believe you missed tagging Ali
Just a bunch of nerds having fun
electroboom, you're gonna regret shooting michael reevees lol
Had a smile on my face the entire time watching this. They did a great job with this.
Which music is at 6:56 ?
Are you from South Azerbaijan?
all of my favourite creators. Take Love everyone!
I’m surprised that this guy didn’t die yet. (In a good way)
@ElectroBoom will you get super high voltage if you connect piezo from lighter to the primary of transformer and just press the Button?
Open Sauce should have a tradition where the attendees blow up the venue as a closing ceremony.
make 20k wats scooter engine i need really high power pleaseee❤
Good to see StyroPyro there, he's still alive and doing well guys! 😁
Remembering boom's 10 year old video of coil gun 🤣🤣🤣
Can you explain the LK-99 SuperConductor?
The fact that he is still alive after all these years proves he's actually smart enough to know the limit
I LOVE THIS I CANT BELIEVE I SAW WREN IN THIS?!?!
آقا مهدی در مورد اینکه پنکه چرا همه‌ش روشنه و نمی سوزه یه نطقی بکن...  حس می کنم عمر پنکه از سیاهچاله‌ها هم پایدارتره
Is it me or does this guy just looks like Gargamel?
Melt molybdenum with induction heater.. That'd be interesting
3:55 I was not expecting that ROFL
Please make a video on VFD and build own circuit of it.
Seeing Micheal Reeves and Colin Furze in one video just gave me thoughts about a collab between the two, how amazing would that be!
Bro I am a BIG fan of BattleBots🎉
I just rediscovered this channel recently. And it makes me so happy that he still makes content!
I want to know why “Open Sauce” is an illustration of a giant robot on treads destroying everything.
It's so cool how so many creators met up at once! Matt Gray is in the background at 5:11!!!
Seeing electroboom and hack Smith in the same room is crazy
You are alive😮!
Mehdi, you are treasure. For many years I never payed much attention to the people behind the YT channels, but Grady, Colin, Mark Rober, Tom de Prinse and, of course, so many others, have found ingenious ways of teaching and educating on so many topics and keeping someone with little to no knowledge in their respective fields, glued to the screen, sometimes by their personalities alone. Thank you so much for what you do and how you do it!
Average IQ in the room like 160
So many nonentities in one hole.
I think he Will need a cement house
I gotta go to the next one
4:18 Did all of those wireless microphones survive getting shocked?
I wish i could come I love your  videos and really wish I could meet you I don't know how but your videos are always interesting and informative
It would be an honor to be tased by you. 🙏
Hey, I've got a very unusual electronics problem, maybe You (or someone who reads this) can help:  I work in industrial electronics and one product ran out of production.  Our boss has cleaned the components warehouse and I can have a ton of  foil capacitors 2,7V / 3,3F.  (Yes, F! Not uF, not mF, but 3,3 Farad!)   What would You do if You had around 15,5 thousand (!!) of such capacitors?   I've thought about a power bank: 5 such capacitors connected in series gives a 13,5V /  0,66F capacitor and 5 of those connected in parallel (25 caps in total) then has 3,3F again, at 13,5V. How many of those 25-packs would You connect in parallel? In theory I could make more than 600 of them, that would be a capacitor around 2000 Farads... 2kF!  2 Fk'ing kF!!! 🤪  But for what? Is there any use? (how to charge that thing? Must have an inner resistance somewhere in the milli- or even micro ohms...)
Sir, I just had an idea of making an electric bomb. Which can actually destroy things....
bro is louis with nigerian accent
Can you convert FM waves to electricity
This gives off vibes of a family gathering.
You are Persian as fuck ❤ Love your accent and content bro✌🏼
I recon codyslab is the smartest guy in there
i think it would be an awesome idea if you built a ECG machine
Jennifer lawrence
Lisa Winter cruising around on a bot
3:17 If you look to the left I think that’s Rebecca Parham of Let Me Explain Studios.
I just want to say I'm been watching your old videos   How are you alive😳
This is the kind of places I want to visit.  Who share this passion with me?
GARGAMEL

Good video! Happy event. Thank you.
That is a pretty amazing collection of the weirdYouTube world along the science/craft/creative axis.
Was that Electo-Cute on the piano?

It's funny, because I'm not smart enough to understand any of the stuff these guys do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaE1Vrk12I

It was blast getting to see you there. Thanks so much!

Unfortunately, Franzoli electronics wasn't availabe
You should've showed michael reevs the shock stick he loves tazers
So many amazing people in one space. Loved seeing a lot of people who I am subscribed to.
I very much dislike this event. Way tot dangerous. What if the building burns down and everybody dies? What should I do with all my time, then? There would be no one left to watch. Scary
سلام بر تو
Over 9000 IQ in that ending photo! 😂
This might be the greatest crossover in history!!
Tell me when i see Michael Reeves    Edit: 5:52 You’re Welcome fellow Michael Reeves fans
Found some fake generator  https://youtube.com/shorts/lHArBiagYnQ?feature=share

Couldnt find erik in the group picture
Understanding concept about switchgear  devices would be a great opportunity for us as viewer
As a Electricle Engineering student and graduate its i think its far more important to understand concepts about intrument and equipments used in industries ... like how does a MCB work
سلام میشه لطفاً یه مدغر بوستر انتن مبایل برای مناطق دورافتاده بسازید ،همه ویدیو های یوتیوت در این زمینه فیک هستند.
omg I'm fan of almost all the youtuber at that event, lucky me no one decided to skadoosh that place else I will not have any reason more to surf youtube again
There is a theory out there that old buildings will have a ball filled with mercury and like somehow spin and makes free energy?? Can you test that out?
For a sec I thought it was the Manhattan Project all over again but it's just a gathering of some of the brightest influencers in one place.
Electrocute being the highest prize plushie made my day 😂❤
WTH??? Cody never told us the robocody can operate autonomously away from chicken base!
7:00 here's cody
That's wild. Literally every creator was there
I did not think a nerd party can have suche a nerdy afterparty. xD
Everyone was there i wanted to see an interaction between Rebecca and styropyro they will make quite the duo
its so fun watching people geek out at these shows
Love the thumbnail with you holding dil...eh magic wand :-)
Your face look like Gary Kasparov
Why are you zooming into their faces. It's uncomfortable for them and us
The 7 people I watch I saw there…. Out of the build stuff content creators. Colin Furze, The hack smith, JLaser, Code Bullet, The Backyard Scientist, Corridor(even if it was only wren) and The Great ElectroBOOM
plot twist: Unnecessary Invention and Integza are one person
this video was so great man, I'm so glad the event was a hit
I didn't see Mr robo hand...
7:25 "Most Intelligent Photo Ever Taken V2" - 2023
Next make a cannon with capacitors
Man I cannot get over with Code Bullet being so fucking handsome...
SUCH A WHO´S WHO OF MY SUBSCRIPTIONS FEED
Styropyro and ElectroBOOM have the danger to die meanwhile the process of making an experiment, while Colin Furze, TBS and TH are more likely to die testing it.
I wish I could've gone, but I live too far away :(
Amazing, almost every maker I follow in one place. I am hoping there will be some interesting future collaboration projects from the meetup.
Got to shock myself and friends with magic wand and it was a good time. 10/10 would recommend  🌩
Bunch of nerds!!  Looks like a blast! 👍👍
What an honor it must have been for these punks to meet the great boom.
wow
holy shit! literally all my favorite creators are there!
Elon musk should have visited
Such a shame I couldn't be there :(    Security told me to go away...
1 second ago No comments No views I'm first.
Hi Mehdi,  Thank you for your great content! Unfortunately, we are currently experiencing terrible electricity outages throughout Egypt. The electricity comes on for two hours and then goes off for one hour. This is making it very difficult for people to use their Wi-Fi routers and fans.  I would be grateful if you could make a video discussing possible solutions to this problem. For example, you could discuss using a car battery and an inverter, or you could review some of the UPS solutions that are available.  I believe that your video would be very helpful to people in Egypt who are struggling with the electricity outages.  Thank you for your time and consideration.
there's a good number of people you didn't mention. Nate from the Internet which use to be from TKOR was there. There was like 3 others there I recognize but didn't know their names/channels. Been wanting to start my own channel as I play around with a massive amount of toxic chemicals and gene splicing. even learned how to make some nerve agents by accident I will not say what they are as it would be a violation of all US laws. Don't worry done have them. All of this I learned myself. Happy to see all of these creators and members in one spot.
Love this. SUPER jealous of all the networking and talent there.
Where was "diode gone wild "
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRH8ksmRCuU  Is this invention for real?🤔
Man i would have loved to see Mattias Krantz there with some of his wacky stuff, specifically that electric piano.
So many channels I follow. Even Nerdforge got there from Norway!  Edit: Also Explosions and Fire from Australia!! Also have to say that I follow about half of the people presented. What a great event/collab. How Michael Reeves was not in the panel 😅
So much cool people, all of the legends there, way to nice. The dangerous creator's are exactly the ones i would put there, perfect.
Bru that people are gonna go home with broses
you gotta love the outro
Do we know piece that this lady played?
Make me laugh my ass off when you said and then we had a panel of the most dangerous creators
Electrocute is so good at piano
BRO STYROPYRO WAS THERE? AND WREN!?
mehdi you need to make a battlebot!
You should make a video about your injuries from your videos or tell us some of your most wild creation ideas.

Science or Project content youtube are bigger than other genres. They're closer than others and for what I can say. "better" than others 🔥
I would have spent all day looking around there 😮
I really should get into this whole maker stuff, seems like fun. The only problem is I can't afford a 3d printer and filament right now because I dropped my phone on my upper jaw and cracked a tooth requiring me to get a filling. Luckily I had dental insurance so I didn't have to pay the full cost, but it still wasn't cheap for how little material was used. Specialized labor of two people like doing dental work is not even remotely cheap. But it's worth every cent because it feels and looks like I never chipped that tooth.
This was wonderful, thank you.
YOOOO I WATCHED ALL THESE GUYS
It was a video of my YouTube subscription list!
I was there, it was an honor to meet all of you
I like this new kind of celebrity.
Even peterpols and the hacksmith are there too wow
that was really fun ! Thank you for bringing us along .
could you try to remake your tesla coil
Panel of most dangerous creators but without I did a thing?!
That was an amazing video. That's nearly all of my subscription.
How could William Osman, Michael revees and Cody not be considered among the most dangeous?
Where did your last video go? I didn't watch it yet :(
Thanks for posting this - wish we could have made it... meeting you and shaking your hand would have been a shocking experience for sure! Maybe next year... xoxo
Simone Giertz probably busy helping out her friend. That or theres just too many dominating male inventors. Would love to see some impractical robots and the one and only Truckla
Like every youtuber I watch minus the car guys 😂😂
a colab with Michael Reeves would be terrifying
Maybe the greatest internet collab ever…
Saw the face of "CODE BULLET" 😆
5:21 I just wanted to ask if he is there...
I love how he's just scaring the crap out of other YouTubers. 😅
CODE BULLET FACE REVEAL???
Michael Reeves and ElectroBoom.... Will be nice
Next up: Villain-Con :)
I would love to participate in an event like that😅
Now just do a Dangerous collab with Colin Furze!!!
Wish I could be there
"freedom units" 😄😄😄😄😄
So where do I sign up for a shock from the special stun stick of electroboom? What, I used to be an electrician, but I like the feeling of 120 and under.
Tell Mark to tune that damn piano
Next up : bringing his magic wand to Disney land Harry Potter world and zapping stuff to become an electro wizard
ooooff no shock-off with michael reeves???
Kinda surprised we didn't see Simone in Truckla there.
Hope I’ll be there next year
I want links to all the channels lol
I was one if the weirdos that asked to be shocked and liked it
I am happy to have come but I wish I saw you 😢
that wheatley was so goddamn well-made it looks like cgi
I couldn't find Tim Station in the group photo. 🤨
why do i recognize all of these people
If someone wanted to end YouTube content, this would be the party to bomb.
Holy crap, they pretty much got everyone
Very good!
I'm still searching for nilered 😅
Women, Life, freedom زن،زندگی،آزادی 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚 🤍🤍🤍🦁☀️🤍🤍🤍 ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Where was "STUFF MADE HERE"?
Yay @beckystern !
Boombastic video. Thank you
what i find pretty amazing -  i  already know most of the guys channels - earth doesn't seem to be this big at all^^
Is fire conductive?
normal people shake hands, mehdi shocks people with his magic wand instead
It was amazing hanging out with so many amazing people !
5:28 it @alispagnola!!! just to the right of Code Nate. (Also at 7:14)
It’s amazing how big the maker community is on YouTube
So sad that I could not make it. But it was around the same time my son was born......very good excuse I would say ;-) Hopefully this event comes back 🙂
I would like to see Great Scott there, and Project Farm would be awesome too! Also, CodeBullet face revealed!
You should let styro pyro build your next magic wand.  Then YouTUBE has e new meaning 😂😂😂
I am also shocked that i almost know everyone 😅
I have never seen the face from code bullet 😂👍
Oh Colin furze is Create down house wow...😮  And mark Robert is good for your 📱 not robbed wow
Damn, its really crazy to imagine seeing all you guys in the same room!
So many cool people in one place; some of my favorites!
Why wasn't Cody there @electroboom ??
I am so sad I did not get to go to this. This looked like the most amazing event ever! And CODY SHIWE UP!!!!
i didn't even relize how many of these creators i actively watch
the face Mehdi makes at 3:12 in comparison to the other is just too funny xD
thank you, for showing all of these I didn't knew about these meet up
I hope we meet some day and other makers, by only seeing all them together in video I'm jumping rn, idk what will happen if I meet you and them in person
It's nice to see youtubers act as awkward as "normal" people when not in front of their own camera
Thank you so much for labeling all the creators.
so like a YouTuber party?
Wish i was there too
The way I know almost all of themkinda feels nice
I am not a creator or engineer or anything but I would give my right leg to be in that place just to listen to some of these conversations.
The biggest crossover episode ever
6:21 Messi Messi Messi
Lol
You take your wand everywhere, I'm sure Linus won't forget it.
Cody!!! I'm so glad he went. Right the f on.
5:26 Unexpected code bullet
Ahh. The science fair days.❤
I didn't know this existed but now it's on the top of my bucket list to go to.
bro what, its like my whole youtube subscribed channels are on that meetup.
😲colin furze  did he flew from uk ?
That group is 90% of my Youtube experience
I'm the only hazard with my gigantic muscles
yo is the sound quality sh*t or my proffesional koss headphones are broken
You was there just to give a shock to everyone 😂😂
So many nerds in 1 event, love it!!
Erik? ERIK? What did he contribute? The Skibidi toilet on loop over the PA? Gave everyone sound cancer for a week?
I really hope Open Sauce becomes a larger thing so there can be one near me.
4:15 Im subscribed to all of the most dangerous creators. I'm not sure what that says about me 🤣🤣
سلام مهدی جان چه کامیونیتی جذابی
Babushka sewing steals the show! 😆
Don't worry LTX will be the next!
code bullet was there? Zomfg
It’s like a school field trip
Wow, so many great minds on the same place! Would be awesome with a longer video next time :D
This is literally the engineers' paradise!!!! Love it!!!!
Show!
I love how everyone brought their great inventions to this place and you brought your magic wand to shock other people.
I wanna get shocked by you 😭🥺
I love watching you all guys 🤩❤️
@6:27 is that the American Gladiators tennis ball gun?!
Holy shit so many awesome creators there!!! I loved seeing how awkward a bunch of them were with the sudden close-ups 😂 And heck, ElectroCUTE is there? I assumed she lost interest in her dad's work, but I guess I was wrong!
From this video I got many educational channel,❤
Watching Mehdi pretend he's just an overexcited fan and not one of the premium content creators at the event was more fun than I could have imagined.
You should bring your electric guitar next time!
Mehdi is what  would be Harry Potter if sent to slytherin
Are your nickname Uncle Shock ???
You’re the first creator I follow that posted something about this event! I’m subbed to so many people in this video. I wondering if this event ever happened! Thank you for sharing your experience!
Wow. That's the coolest event of the whole year
More proof that no one likes Integza lol
and here i am being stupid in my moldy concrete box
Comment section is just YouTubers shouting themselves out 🤣
Few things, it was so great to see so many creators, i actually watch, this is my event, if anything! Secondly, it was so lovely to see you shouting out smaller channels like Mark Robers... Thirdly, you should collab with Michal Reeves! That would be a shocking collab!
What a great idea for an expo. I hope it continues for many years to come. Hopefully it can come to other countries in the future?
Am I crazy or your video dont have sound ?
You know the yt algorithm works when you know almost every creator in this video
I got a serious nerd on.
The literal veritable who's who of my favorite youtubers!
i dont know whether to be embarrassed about not knowing who most of these wonderful creators are, or to be excited about discovering them for the first time!
5:47 people still jumps into those things even after what happened at twitch con?
So many cool and interesting people in one place, such an amazing event!
Missing Physics Girl here. I wish she could have joined as well.
Nice, love these open events, rarely see him go outdoors lol.
I was freaking out at just the video, can't image being in a room with basically all my favorite channels
Thanks for sharing it !
I miss Physics girl in this video... 😔. I hope she will be back soon.
Haha I wasn't expecting to see Internet Comment Etiquette in the list of names. And some of the folks that traveled across the globe to be there, like Integza, Lab Muffin, and NerdForge. That's pretty awesome.
0:15 Ryan, is that you? 🤔
best crossover event
At 3 seconds I slided the player back to the zero mark, was expecting the 'hi'.  Gave up and then at the 6 second mark ....  Who did the same :)
Dude, I don't like this video. I love it!
All of you together could destroy a country xD
Why wasn't 'stuff made here' invited
A panel of the most dangerous creators? I didnt see michael reeves up there so your statement is false. lol
I miss Stuff made here...
I am happy you visited me for my real nothing see you next year❤❤
God I can't believe I was in the same city as this event and didn't go
OH MAN, YOU MEET JENNIFER LAWRENCE!!
I'm trying to figure out which one was This Old Tony....
What a great time and gathering thanks for taking us along to enjoy this with you, longtime viewers, Big Like ad always ❤
Best events 😂😂😂
Wow, all my favourite youtubers. Wish I could join next year.
Go to pORTLAND next and I’ll go
I think we have the great @alispagnola at 5:28
Thank You
The labeling reminds me of pop-up video
Seeing all of the YouTube Science/Tech/Maker royalty together like this really made my day! So many channels I already follow and a whole bunch more to add! Thanks for being our liaison, Mehdi!!
Shocking and scandalous!
That seems like a great bunch of people to be around :3 all my favs ^^ <3
So glad styropyro was there. I was waiting for his name to come up the whole time
Dude, a veritable who's-who of YouTube geekdom, DIYing, and science!!!
It was cool meeting you Medhi! Hope to see you again next year!
So literally everyone was there
I like the old lady sewing. I thought she was a robot for a second.😂
Hi MEHDI can you test Bluetooth under water for a next project?
Do you need to check if someone has a pace maker before they can hold hands in the ring of torment err… friendship?
It’s crazy that 95% of the people in this video I watch.
It's like a world's fair for people not backed by giant gobs of money and corporate power. A world's fair of garage engineering.
Was Destin from SmarterEveryDay there also Veritasium and Science Girl?
I think I missed out my dream job, I love every single one of these creators. All of them crazy and inventive. 😂 I hope James from Action Labs was there and Vsauce?
Where's the kid from Tik Tok that sent electricity 1000 miles away?
PLASMA CHANNEL!!! 😍😍😍
rctestflight yay
it looks awesome!!!! i Would love to go!!!
Nice shock to meet you.
if styro was there it sure must have been a blast lol
So much Awesome talent under one roof!! Thanks for sharing.
Why are electrons negative in my mind  negative  thing have no charge we should call them posatrons  and they should be positive makes no since like the ph scale acids burn means it's hot should be a higher number.
Code "fucking" bullet how do you know his face?   Jk I saw his video
@ElectroBOOM did you miss a label mate? I saw @Nerdforge at 5:14
Gonna be honest.  You're gonna have to step it up a couple of notches if you want to beat "Back Yard Scientist" for "Most Dangerous Creator".
Poor Integza with his backpack, looks like a lost tourist hahaha
I saw Cody from Cody's Lab!
There are people with verified accounts down here with 0 likes 😂😂 Devastating for them
Wow Mehdi it's like a who's who of science creators, I liked the fact that Cody was there and not to mention all the other mad buggers. Just imagine having all that brain power in one place you guys could be unstoppable!
Haha, what is your score? i watched atleast 50% of the channels that got name bubbles in the vid.
Where's Alec from Technology Connections? I didn't see him.
This background music was so anoying. Sorry, but it was.
Crazy seeing myself in an electroboom video, even if just in the audience of the talk lol
Where Adam Savage? :-/
What a lovely convention. I've even seen some of these devices on YouTube. Perfect place to put electroboom on stand and have a showcase on it. Him*
good to see that styropyro hasnt unalived himself and is still going
jisus, i only know mahybe.. 6 of the whole people shown and subscribed to even less
That was super cool
I'd love to listen to that "most dangerous creators" talk. got a link?
it was pretty fun seeing Integza not in his classic suspenders and dress shirt
Lovely! Youtube should host events like these
omg such an awsome evenement!
it'd be fun if you had a series reviewing fake electronic content, like you did in that metal detector video.
me half happily crying cause i wouldnt want to spend that much money on the tickets.
When creators go to sleep they check under the bed for Michael Reeves.  When Michael Reeves go to sleep he check under the bed for Mehdi Sadaghdar…
This event was the best weekend of my life! It was nice to meet you and getting shocked by you. Also, I think I just figured out why a butt-load of people just joined my channel. 😁 I can’t wait for next year!
Wow, many of my favourite creators all in one video! Nice to see you there, too, Mr. Boom ;-)
Lots of cool folks
One of the nicest videos, really nice idea😂😂😂
As a Tiny Unknown YouTuber I wish i could go there 😢 ❤
Hello Mr. Boom, could you make a video about powering a house with solar power? Why are inverters so expensive in EU compared to on aliexpress and what types of batteries are suitable?
So that is why @CodeBullet dont make videos. XD
Mark Rober just choked while eating the burger...
Do you think piezoelectric could run off of rain drops?
Hey, can you explain about DIY 4G signal booster circuit diagrams. So many video about it. Is it fake or real??
jenefer lawrance lmaooooo
I would’ve gone to the event if it wasn’t like $200 which is so expensive
Nerd convention, I love it
Good life .
Bps space
How cool is this. My  whole sublist was there. I wonder how much viewers all these creators would have together🤔
Michael Reeve and your colab: race of who can electrocute more people
All the YouTubers in one wow what an awesome video
This seemed fun
https://youtu.be/m2Rd5LC5_ck
Like a bunch of kids at a playground. Looked like a TON of fun!
So good to see Peter sripol
More like Open Sausage Fest.
I sorely wish I could have come for Opensauce, but flying in from Ontario, Canada without a previous year's saving is just rough
3:08 oh, we're just going to be all kumbaya here. Okay.  Wait Medhi is here...  What's that he's holding?  Oh, no. I've made a mistake.  😂
This was my YouTube in real life. 😍
2:48 Jay!! With @plasmachannel  There are soo many cool people I follow and love their work on here!  I wish I could've been there, it looks like a blast!  I would've just been feeling out the whole time
That's heaven right there. It would if some volunteer created links to all of those creators so we can follow them?
open sauce. Why must smart people be so moronic with language.
Omg "Oh, that's in freedom units..." Lol😅😅😅😅😆😅😆
How is TheOdd1sout here! wtf that's awesome!!
Ok, so basically my whole subscription feed was having a party and didn't invite me.
WHEATLY CORE!!!!!
I really enjoyed that memorable event
WTF i know at least 90% of the creators😂😂 I feel so happy and grateful 💗
Idk if is bad or good to know ALL the youtubers that appears in the video, lllllllove it
Wow! Styropyro is also there.
How cool, Electrocute still play the piano
7:15 not styropyro casually doing a RING MUSCLEUP in the background holy shit
It's ridiculous how many of these people I know and watch. Such a shame I live in Europe, this looked incredible
5:20 "jennifer lawrence" LMAO
It’s a dad vlog 😂
Aww man, i didn't get to see electroboom x Michael reeves getting shocked collab
A youtuber meeting other youtubers. 🙃
Too bad Kyle Hill was too scared to show up and have his big ego zapped
is it crazy that almost half of the people in this labeled creators i have watched already, i love the 5 in the stage cause i watch all of them specialy Electroboom and styropyro with his lasers, i thing i realize is that i am a couch potato and might have acumulated 5k hours above here on youtube
Interesting video.
There are S&M convention if you want to shock weirdos who like it.
What I would've given to see Mehdi, styropyro, Cody's lab, Explosions&fire, and "Mr. Red" NileRed in the same place. 5 of the most dangerous/intelligent/creative people (that I know of) on YouTube. In the same place. I don't get starstruck really but that's awesome. And dangerous. We need a collab.
Strange parts! Nice suprise at the end I hope he has a video of the event, can imagine him going around asking everyone exactly how their stuff works lol
I wish I could’ve been there 🥲
wondering the consequences of zapping on random people and some with unknown heart condition or pace makers? 🤔🤔
my favourite part of this is Mehdi going around and harassing other youtubers
this is in san francisco, right?
I guessed it right. ElectroCUTE must be someone related to you. :D
Why wasn't Elon Musk invited to this??m
Oh man, I wish I could've been there!
Am I the only one adding "-inator" to every device he speaks out there😂😂😂
Of all the Cons and events this one is one I actually want to go to. Heres hoping it happens next year. I definitely want to go. This is the kind of youtube cultural event that the maker community deserves and wants. Well done William and crew!
Mehdi you're such a treasure!
Wow what a great event to visit
6:43 Nate from the Internet long time fav of mine from TKOR days, was surprised Mehdi didn't label him.
Mehdi should remake the shocking chess game but with his homemade taser instead
Lovely! The social awkwardness is palpable 😃🥰
Fact : i know them all 👀  & subscribed to them ❤️
rare to see a freakin youtuber knowing the difference between rail gun and coil gun
Who'd of thought EB would bring a taster to an event? No one, because that's just silly.
My favourite moment of this video is definitely the freedom units
I follow all the most of the creators in this videos  My be there must be some event for audience also 😅😅😅
Man i wish i could have gone, living on the other side of the world is a little bit of a bummer sometimes lol. Its amazing how many of these people i knew that you labled, didnt realise i was so ingraned in the community 😂
That was soo good man, really enjoyed it
a real hows how at the end 🙂( a pity, could put all toughs creative minds to something constructive, but look like the networking and have fun at the same time? 🙂 )
Since I started making money on crypto currency I invested $7,000 and my profits are $25,850 every 11 days and I never lost my money on crypto.
Mark Robber and the Frontyard Scientist collab when
4:34 Woah no way I didn't expect Wheatley to be here, I just finished Portal 2 for the first time just about 2 weeks ago, I love this character a lot.
All my Youtube suscriptions in one building.
Practical engineering looked so uncomfortable haha
I wish  we had an event similar to this one at greece so i could go there
My Youtube on one spot
I love styropro
Code bullet face reveal...
ElectroSAUCE
Williams greatest power is tricking everyone into thinking he's a bumbling idiot.  But he's a smarty boi, this event was always going to be great.
literally everyone I love was there lol, didnt expect wren and codeBullet :D
You need to do a collaboration with the most dangerous Youtubers 😉
4:14 I know and love 4/5  Plus why is a chemist in an engineering event?
Fully 80% of my YouTube subscriptions are listed 🎉
This is phenomenal! I turn 60 next month and I love to see what you lot are coming up with. Your good humour and open minds are what give me hope for the future of humanity.  Thanks for all you do.
What an amazing event! Passion everywhere
This place looks like heaven!
Looked like a proper science con. Wish they had that stuff in Australia.  Also, I wonder if AvE was there in disguise. Also awesome to see Explosions and Fire there!  Was that Ali Spagnolo too??
Its like endgame avenger assemble scene for them.
Looks like you had a great time!
Your daughter on Piano was amazing.
So cool you got to meet Erik from internet comment etiquette
This was a great collaboration of youtube nerds, I hope someday I can also go there and I'm a big fan of these youtube inventors and that's the reason why I continue to work as a computer technician because I'm inspired by electroboom.
what the helll yrr everyone was there..!!!
Can anyone list the Youtube channels for these people ?
5:30 Isn't that Brent Underwood to the left?
The hexa game, by Zac, awesome.
Didn’t know that @integza was that small
Robers  r a p e d u ng e on
Rober gives me p e do vibes!!!
Missing physics girl 🥺.. Praying for her speedy recovery ❤
This video helped a lot to know more awesome creators. :)
6:41 all tomatoes are out of the building.
now you need to do a cross episode with every single creator that was on that event :)
NileRed: Turn crunch labs into vodka
I'm sorry... Did you do a face reveal on code bullet before he did one on his own channel?!
So, isn' your Magic Wand just a cattle prod for recreational use?
Seems like an awesome event! Wish I could be there haha
Love you all🎉❤❤❤I get inspiration to do something new because you are there, from Bangladesh😊
5 years ago, this would make me excited.
Well, i think there are almost all content creators i know and watch at the CrunchLabs ;-) Ok Adam Savage and Tom Stanton are missing, but the rest is there ;-) It seems to be such a nice group of people!
باریک الله به دخترت که پیانو هم میزنه . میگم مهدی به نظر میاد تو این ویدئو از بین اینهمه مرد ، فقط یک مرد ایرانی کچل هست .
Mehdi invented magic wand so he can hold hands. noted.
I just realized how big of a nerd I am, I know most of these people, hahaha
aww wheres i did a thing
I saw Nate and was like "Oh no, did he miss him?!" and was later mentioned :P
A bunch of engineers and scientists sitting in a room while a piano plays by itself is truly a scene of the future
Hmm, why don't i see Cody? is he still on Mar?
I wish there was something like this in Europe! Would be so much fun seeing all the creation and creators!
I got pcd just watching it.
Now this is The "colab" of the year. Awesome to see so many creatives in one place
Shocking!. My mind is blown, seeing all these beautiful makers who I also subscribe to like Mark Rober, Colin Furze, eStefanie & so many more. I had tears of joy watching you all, haven't felt this giddy since I was a teenager in love & will always be grateful to Mark for his glitter bombs & for helping to clear out that scam call centre & eSteffanie for all her amazing videos. Only way you can top this is to also show Shango066, Mr Carlson's lab, Temporarily Offline, Ham Radio DX, Mikes Radio Repair & Look Mum No Computer because I'm sure he'll surprise us all again & maybe add Steveo1kinevo for added coolness along with Ham Radio DX (Hayden), Great Scott, eevBlog, All American Five Radio, W2AEW (Alan), Joes Classic Video Games (Ron) & Electronoobs. Why can't we just get rid of all our useless politicians & replace them with all these cool & ultra talented makers who actually help this world, rather than seek to tear it down & blame others.  These makers take personal responsibility & leadership by implementing their super cool ideas & are an amazing example to our younger generations so we also create a new breed of makers. Sending both yourself & all these beautiful creators my love & I hope they never stop creating because this world needs solutions, not to be at each others throats all so the elite make more money off pointless wars at the expense of humanity
7:15 OMG Cody'sLab and StyroPro in the same square meter!!!
Much re-watch to check every channel !
0:30 My Favorite
"Most dangerous creators" electroboom and styropyro on the same stage... yup checks out to me. that's a scary combo
Was waiting to see if Integza was there. SO happy to see him too.
You are my fav inventor :D
Jennifer Lawrence was smoking hot, as usual
ElectroBOOM, Styropyro, and Michael Reeves in the same building. Now that’s something that only good things can come from!
If all of these people got together to build one project, it would destroy the world.
Mehdi being such a fanboy for 8min perfect!
7:35 21st century equivalent of the 20th century solvay conference picture.  History has been made.
Estefannie looking like a tramp.    I mean champ 👀
Open Sauce, i thought it would be a Meth Smoking Convention. Boy how wrong i was on this one...  :D :D :D
Awesome!!! 90% of my subscriptions in a single video, and about 50 new ones that I should probably subscribe to now
When is the next event ????
Ayo peter sripol too broooo  edit: im a kid who wants to go but missed the event 💀
im sure some govt 🕴 was onsite seeing the military applications 🤔?
Nice to see you and everybody else enjoying yourselves.
It was good seeing wren having his time there
im surprised he didn't shutdown the entire venue with his emp wand
the happiest mehdi will be this year  other than christmas of course
Ali Spagnola was there also. The fit girl in the white top and red glasses. 5:13 5:28 and very end scene group, 5th person from the far right on the bottom.
It's like Oppenheimer but DIY
Glad you enjoyed the event.  As an general attendee I found Open Sauce chaotic.  It was very loud, none of the panels started on time, there were long lines and dense crowds, and insufficient food and refreshments.  I enjoyed chatting with folks at their booths but it was difficult to have a conversation amid the noise and I was exhausted by the end of the day.  This event would benefit from a venue where folks could spread out more, like Maker Faire.  I’d also enjoy having a forum for prepared tech talks or workshops in addition to the interview panels.
You signed my benchy! What a wonderful experience
With Electroboom and Michael Reeves in the same room, not a soul will be left untazed.
Matt Gray was in the Crunchlabs photo! (Blue t-shirt, in front of the right-hand side purple post.) Yay!
I wish I could`ve gone 😔
its honestly impressive you managed to cite everyone!
It's so exciting to barely see Peter Brown and Technology Connections, love those guys a lot
I think im subscribed to literally everyone in this video
Thanks for tagging. Expanding subscription-list
A black tie event for nerds
I can’t believe Jennifer Lawrence was able to make it 😆 but seriously what a group of legends 🤙
this is a shocking video :)
You should do a collab video with colinfurze someday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDlLgK2ZBnI
all the anonymous creator got face reveal 🥲
Howe many people can you shock with your wand at the same time ?
4:34 The _one_ thing this thing is missing is the aperture logo for the fan holes.
Holy shit. I had no idea how deep I was  into this part of the internet till I realized I recognized everyone on sight. Might save up for a trip next year.
IDK why I feel like this, but you should not be allowed in public. BTW Love your work man! I wish I had a teacher like you in my electronics classes.... or may be not😅😅
The Worst part about watching Weirdo Nerds Nerding out when meeting other Weirdo Nerds...is just...well realising that I missed out ..so sad now :(  We only just had a Maker Faire here in Melbourne last year that was Massively Successful - one of the best things I had ever done was volunteer there.  100% going to do it again, would love to see some Headline Weirdo Nerds there later this year...or future years.
I like how the channels represented here are like 100+M subs and there was like few hundreds of people or something mostly the creators themselves? xD
This looks like my youtube heaven, lol.. so many recognizable youtubers I watch..
4:14 is the avengers..
The only reason i want to live in america is to visit open souce
wish i could have gone!!! thank you for letting me live vicariously through you for a few min. very cool
There is more knowledge in that last photo than all of the rest of YouTube combined
I need taser chess, except for yugioh.
I hope Colin Furze brought his entire bunker.😂
damn I felt the electricity at 0:47  shocked my brain xD
GLAD no one constructed GLAdOS
The most useful thing there, I believe, is that animatronic eye. Really cool and complicated stuff.
I half expected Code Bullet to be wearing a TV on his head.
This is the greatest crossover ever.
Now this youtube rewind I can stand for
6:30 Seen micheal reeves in a yt video was my highlight 😂
Anyone know where is Evan Kale?
Was adam savage not there?  Figured he’d been there with something odd..
Which came first, the code bullet face reveal or the event?
Now they know what it’s like to be you
That granny has a pretty good gaming setup
codyslab and styropyro at the rings i love it
Hope you and Wren/Corridor do a collab!
how tf did he get all these people to come? is the science community in youtube just this intertwined?
Man I would've loved going to that. If I had enough money I would
3:19 is that fireship on the right?
Awesome to see you shocking people from a distance! Your presence is electrifying😆
electroboom always casuakly carrying a tesla want in his pocket 💀
A LOT of my subscriptions are at this event.
What a wonderful collection of bright minds ! The planet tilted with so much IQ in a single spot.
Why is electroboom such a treasure?
WHERE is I Did a thing
Grady from Practical Engineering!
i really wanted to go to this but I couldn't, its kinda funny that I know all those people!
Thank you for sharing so much fun!!!
so sad i missed this, and its close enough of a drive for me....
Nerds!
So many other creators for Mehdi to do collaborations with! :)
Nerd Disneyland 😂
Wow.... I subscribe to soooo many of them. Awesome!
@codyslab BRO
People like those in this video and at this event are the antidote to my cynical disgust at what I see as the general downward trend of intellect in humanity in general. Knowing that such an event could be organized and conducted gives me a glimmer of hope that we are not doomed.
Looks like the only really famous person was Mark Rober
who are you hero?, they are :3
2:30 I hope they make a self loading pez
How about you guys make a mega project or something every year
wow first time i seen codebullet in "person" - not as a monitor-headed fever dream
I wish I'd been able to make it to this, meeting you and all of the creators would have been incredible.  I feel like this was a true convention of the minds.
this looked so fun
Just watching this made my day
This would have been a fun event to be at.
[COMMENT REPOST] Hehehe, this is a bit of the most wholesome content in the world! Thanks for being fantastic!
7:32 @yepitsstilltori and @robbysauce.
What an amazing event. I'm subbed to quite a few of the attendees and would have fanboyed out something extreme if I was there.
I would have loved to see Simone, Laura, and Dianna.  Waiting for your return Dianna!
Mehdi, is there any FREE ENERGY DEVICES there? 😉😉😉😉
The shape of your wand looks a little bit suspicious...
This is my MCU crossover
I have huge FOMO! This HAS to be an event in the future again. So awesome!
Omg Colin and electro in the same room and mark … looks like a blast ✌️
Wow, looks like the entirety of maker YouTube was there!
It's weird how many of these awesome people I watch.
I love a channel that has "shocking hazard" and "best event of the year" in the same sentence. 😆
I love that Jennifer Lawrence made an appearance!
I'm sad I had a miss out on this. But hoping to make it next year. I'm glad it was such a hit!!
Only this video uploaded you not uploaded other creatures 😅😂
A colab between you and integza would be great if it wernt for time zones
🇵🇸 freedom for Palestine
good to see mehdi's main purpose was to cause as much electrocution as possible
If I never see another R2-D2 robot again it'll be too soon.
I knew 99% of who everyone was there. Dang that's so cool to see all of my favorite creators there. Yourself included 😂 but one was missing, he's from utah. Keystone science. Where is he?
Opensauce would've been awesome to go to but unfortunately it was all the way across the country, I've never been on a long trip by myself, and I had a number of distractions which would have kept me from going anyways.  Hopefully I'll get to see it if/when the event happens again.
I wish I was there! There’s so many people I recognize and would love to meet!
I forgot about this, this explains why my subscriptions feed is so empty lol.
Most dangerous creators panel without Reeves and Integza??
As a fellow pianist i must say this even though it has not much to do with the video itself... Your daughter (or at least I think it's her) has made quite a progression on the instrument! Congratulations!!
Most Dangerous creator's YEEEEAAAH
Looks fun, styropyro and mehdi my fav
how could you not shock everyone in crunchlabs!
I'm thinking that maybe these guys would be useful in Ukraine right now. Might have to step things up a few notches though.
thats like half of my youtube subscriptions right there
I spotted a youtuber that wasnt mentioned @MattGrayYES
It was so great to meet you! One of the best recaps so far
I want a collaboration with Michael Reeves, shocking people is FUN!
Genuinely impressed about how many creators are there,  must of been hard to leave!
I got overly excited when I saw @NerdForge at 5:14. I'd know that two-tone hair anywhere!
So, is this the new Maker Fair, or what?
This explains where y'all dissapeared to
DUDE! so many creators I watch all in one place! would've been a really cool day out.
Integza! I'm watching all of these people I watch, taking notes of people I need to check out, and then when I see Joel there from Portugal and I squealed! Lol
Reminds me of a HOPE (Hackers On Planet Earth) conference I was at several years back.  This girl had a 100,000 volt stun gun, and we made several circles of people holding hands and shocked through everyone, but only the 2 touching the electrodes actually felt anything.  Then I used up the rest of her battery shocking myself with it. 😀
Man I was kept saying I know for a fact backyardscientist was there and at 4:10 I was happy to see he made an appearance!
Funny people
Cody's Lab 💪💪
Hey EB ⚡️ thanks for this vid, love to see everybody having a good time. Reminds me of Orlando’s maker fair each year, but amped up! 💥 - Take care, be safe and stay clear of the stray negative’s 😊
I just got an ad before the video started and VSause blew me a kiss. How should I feel about this?
@codebullet being called out every since his face slip
what's the minimum requirements for getting a stand at the event?
coooool!!
Such a wholesome meeting!!! Everyone just showed up and exhibit their self-developed technology and sharing knowledge.
WOW.. All my favorite Youtubers in 1 room!?? HOW?
Wow I didn't think that event would be THAT huge.
This is awesome worlds biggest collab lol
@codebullet looks lazy in person too😂
omg everyone made it to Marks Crunch lab!
Heh styropyro.
He said “it’s in freedom units” 😂😂😂
Shocky shocky now
Thanks for the behind the scenes!
OMG Unnecessary Inventions, Nerd Forge, Evan and Katelyn, and and... Damn I realized I knew too many of these crazy engineers.  I am such a geek.
It was an honor to be shocked by the great electroboom. One of my favorite people to see at opensause. Especialy with those captivating eyebrows.
So much talent in one room, imagin if they got split in to teams and worked on just building stuff that would make everyday life better/easyer and sharing it after before any of it could be blocked by the big corporations that makes money of life being hard.
ElecroBOOM brings a a fun-time cattle prod to Open Source 🤣
Wow that event looked so awesome! Such a shame i couldnt attend
I hope to make it someday
Every video I see of opensauce I'm just more disappointed I couldn't attend. It seemed like so much fun. Hopefully I can be there next year!
Taser chess boxing would be entertaining enough to make it to the olympics i reckon
Will the be open sauce next year?
The chess set from Doctor Who 🤣
This is like comic con for engineers, so cool!
I'm both happy and scared to see that Mehdi and Micheal Reeves now know each other.
wake up mehdi upload new video
دمت گرم
Auto aiming turrets? Spy sappin' mah sentry!
holy shit, I recognize so many faces in the second half of the video!  It's crazy to think how many people these creators inspire with their videos!
Electrocute piano skills on point.
I feel like I'm missing out!
Thank you for sharing that wonderful event !❤
these people gather togather can destroy the world. just like oppenheimer gather all those scientist and engineer
I’ve spotted Inetgza ! 😉
Can Mark do a video on some of the cool stuff in here instead of another glitter bomb??
میدونم مهدی تو این کامنتو نمیخونی ولی اره دپست دارم امتحان کنم دستگاهتو ❤❤ عشق از ایران Mehdi  i know it ur not gonna read this comment but yeah i wana try getting shocked by your things ❤😂😂 love from iran
Damn all my favorite YouTuber in one video.
I’ve known a few ‘name droppers’, but this takes the cake😂 so awesome to see so many creative people hanging out together
pacemaker havers at open sauce be like: ooww owie oooh ow no no no owwwww
The dad of youtube electronics
Such an incredible event!  I’m so upset I missed you but it was an absolute blast 💥🐢
I had a big stupid grin on my face the whole time watching this. Mehdi is also just so genuine and curious, it's infectious! (Edit): So cool that Wren from Corridor was there! (Edit edit): Nerd Forge made it out too and Scotty from Strange Parts!?! Man this event is insane!
daymn like EVERYBODY was there 😮
Who's the girl with white hair on the right at the end of the video?
All those creators are appreciating the Mehdi shout-outs! 🤗🤗 4:07 R2, we love youuuuuuuuuu! 💓💓 5:38 ElectroCUTE has become ElectroBEAUT!  ☺☺  6:55 And ElectroMUSE, as well! 🎹🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵👏👏👏👏👏👏
nerdgasm intensifies
This was really cool! It still feels almost illegal to se Code Bullet's face.
Cody looking happy makes me happy.
Cody slab
What a shocking event! You must have felt the electricity in the air.
awesome!! thanks for sharing Mehdi!!!
Oh man it looks like theres loads of people there i hope it was a huge success.
Thank you so much for doing that. I found so many other great creators to follow. Really appreciate you taking the time. Glad you had a good time
So many, content creators, I can't believe there are no unintended face reveals in here.
guys, just for fun can you try together to save the world in the next event?
No invite for I Did A Thing? 😢
Damn, if you ever have the feeling you've seen the internet. Go to this video. There's just years of footage walking around in this video.
ElectroCracker.  Cracks me up    This is the best pick up channel.
Hopefully this opens the way for each and every one of these creators to join the safety third podcast for an episode or two.
AWESOME my crazy friend.....Thanks so much 👍👍                                                                                                            Crazy Old stinking Shoe🇺🇸
I'm so bummed I missed it (work stuff came up) it looked like everyone had a great time. I'm eager to go next year!!
Allen pan's legs😅
is this a crossover episode????
You and Michael would be an iconic collab
I didn't find Technology Connections and NileRed on the video :c
That final shot was pretty much every YouTuber I watch. :O
6:55 She has amazingly beautiful breasts! Her OnlyFans is coming soon.
This was like an avengers level meetup of the nerdiverse and I love it! I'd kill to be there!
Hiiii....
Having an event like this with mehdi wandering around with his magic wand is definitely the most shocking event.
Being there with you all is my dream but as a Polish guy it probably will never come true
bps space is elon musk clone that went rouge..  the others are contained in mars.
It looks awesome, I wish I got to go !
Not THAT is a convention worth going to! I cannot wait for next year!!!!
A breath of fresh air and POSITIVITY! And negativity when you complete the circuit with the shock wand, haha!
This just got added to my bucket list, will be going next year to meet all these legendary creators
Taser Chess is something for Andrea Botez to try out ;)
So amazing to see you all interacting. Yay!
No Simone Giertz or Adam Savage? I'm surprised!
And that was how we found Code Bullet....
Literally just a big pre lobby 😂
Only recognized a few people but that looked like a great time
MEETING YOU AT OPEN SAUCE WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!1!1!!!! your also insanely tall irl the videos make you make shorter but this dudes like 6'7.
event was ...pasty
"We had a panel with the most dangerous YouTubers." Well I see Mehdi, Furze and Backyard Scientist, 3 of my favorite YouTube channels, and I literally just watch Furze's knife belt reel before this video.
Feck me! Thats an amazing line up!
I was surprised at how many creators I knew by name. And also how many I didn't know.
How tf did Erik sneak in? Also love that Explosions and Fire made it
Why don't you make ONE BIG COLABORATION VIDEO with everybody
I saw Nate on the Internet.
Events like this give me sooo much hope for the future.
you didn't observe how you are dramatically more oxidized than at least 97% of the gathered samples???
7:24 "Is that everyone?" "What, you wanted more?"
I was hoping ben heck was there.
new electroboom content a highlight in my day
I was not expecting CodeBullet to get invited to CrunchLabs. That's awesome.
Looks like Open Sauce was Awesome Sauce!
Fuck me sideways, thats the cooles room I've ever seen D:  Next time please have the event on a proper continent!
all of the science side of youtube in one building... so much chaos is possible
sad Micheal Reeves want here
I want to see a collab between ElectroBOOM and crackhead Reeves to see how many different ways they can taze people xD
5:14 - Martina from Nerdforge (Helgi shows up in the group shot) and James the Hacksmith!
I hope you asked people if they had heart conditions before the shocking...
You missed Marina 5:18
“Freedom units” 😂😂
Wow. Insane seeing code bullet there :O
Bigger crossover than avengers endgame
I hope you all enjoyed yourselves. Now NEVER DO IT AGAIN. Do you have ANY IDEA what a collective risk it was to put all the internet's smartest people in one place like that?! A single catastrophe could have lowered the internet's IQ by a considerable factor in an instant!
Truly incredible, all the people behind my entire intake of media all in one place at one time
So jealous.  Wish I could've been there.
Meeting you was incredible! If anyone is unsure if Mehdi is as animated in person as he is in the videos, I can confirm that he most definitely is.  I'm still mad at my wife for not letting you shock my 11-month-old son...
electroboom x practicalengineering, the crossover I didnt know I wanted lol thanks for the youtube channel recommendations
Is that a f kin gyroscopic head ?
That was some event Medhi.  So much creative talent in one space.  A shocking time had by all.  Cheers!
Was Michael Reeves there?
Wireless version of what I my shop teacher had me make
So cool seeing all those creators together having fun.
this is just beautiful. thank all of you guys for the years that have past and the decades to come.
I've been waiting for videos to come out from this event, like 20+ creators i follow went there. I recognized so many people in this video!
Can I be at the next event?
That was a lot of satisfying popping names
I really hoped that Veritasium is there. You could debate the 100km circuit again lmao
looks like a fun event. love that its not as commercialized as other fairs. was it youtubers only?
Please stop electrocuting yourself!  Just be yourself
Inspirative. Being surprised how many participants I follow already ... let's investigate the others...
You look as happy as a unibrow clown. Good on you sir, well deserved. 👊🏻
Did you just face reveal code bullet? Or did he himself in the past? Pretty sure he didnt..
Hi Mehdi, You should release the magic wand as a product available to buy
i mean.. you have nice magic wnd tho.
ISNT IT TIME.FOR  NEW WORLD FAIR! seriuosly though!
I really though i saw Jennifer Lawrence there. Good thing you labled everyones name correctly.
This Old Tony (his hands) wasn't there. :(
I never noticed the resemblance of jennifer lawrence to Michael reeves😅
0:20 Battlebots Lisa Winter?
Did TOTs hands make an appearance too? 🤔😁🙃
The last photo has almost the same energy like the photo taken of many scientists including Einstein,Mary cury etc
All these creators in one place. WOW! The amount of knowledge and skill there was more than all of NASA.
7:28 Being there would be a dream come true! So many awesome people!
Lol ❤
4:23 colliinn
At 5:33 you see a small ball suspended in a column of air. This is not new. In the ‘50s, if you entered any Sears & Roebucks store, you would find in the appliance department a display of their vacuum cleaner with the hose connected to the output, and balanced  on the resulting column of air was a beach ball, forever bobbing up and down.in the stream. I don’t know if it sold any vacuum cleaners, but I remember it 70 years later.
Maybe it's the pink hair and all black clothing, but I could swear that the woman riding around on the flashy board at 0:17 was Lady Ada!
I have looked up some yet unknown for me creators / engineers. Thanks a lot!
I just realised why I had no content this week, everyone I'm subscribed to was out having fun at Mark Robers house!
Everyone was filmed mid sentence
Even wanna be nerds would love this.
"open sauce" but open only to YT weirdos 😀
Mark Rober's reaction to Mehdi was amazing.
at 07:15 you missed Explosions&Fire (Tom) upper left corner in back
5:08 no pop-up love for James Bruton?   Ah ha, 6:53. I gotta stop commenting before I'm done watching!
6:00 I got it😂 good one
Why somewhere ppl just enjoying science but in my country I have to enjoy war. Fugging putin
Dam, this truly is all my favorite creators in one area.
My favorite YouTuber of all time! Too bad there's not many videos being posted like before. I appreciate you Cody's Lab
4:02 Hello there! Come here, my little friend!
Whaaa!!!
Where's technology connections?
I will meet you. Eventually
The amount of intelligence in that room would be so intimidating hahaha.
It was great getting zapped by you and getting a picture with my 360 camera
So many nerds in one place, a wonder that they didn’t collapse into a black nerd hole😂
im going next year
freedom units
Sooooooo many awesome youtubers. And I wonder if the R2-D2 was CuriousMarc's, haha!
Me han faltado los subtítulos en español 🇪🇦😔
it was rly fun there hope i get there again nxt year
You forgot to label one guy named Mehdi there.
I smiled all the way through that- nice to se so many creators under one roof 😊
So many of my favorite creators in one place!!! The brainstorming must have gone in overflow mode!
You know you are using youtube the right way when you recognize 80%+ of the names shown in this video.
WOW!! All of my favourite creators in one convention!  That must have been AWESOME!  Thanks, Mehdi!!
So many ppl I know and love watching
That looks like so much fun! I could be in that building for days and still find stuff to oggle over
مهدی ماشاالله دخترت بود پیانو میزد؟!👏🌹❤️ خدا حفظش کنه و سایه شما رو از سرش کم نکنه🤲🏼
Mr. Bean at maker's fair
5:18 THIS IS WHERE MICHAEL REEVES HAS BEEN HIDING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS
It was great meeting you Mehdi! I do regret that I did not get shocked though. Hopefully next year!
Nice!!
To the guy who made the auto shooting nerf gun. 🤔 can I attach a laser, and have it track eye balls?? Just curious. That’s all.
Man, that looks like it was a lot of fun. See you at LTX this weekend! Hope you bring the wand
But did you shock micheal reeves?
I had the honor of being the one directly shocked by you! Me and my girlfriend were the ones star struck haha. Thanks for motivating me to study electronical engineering! Learning with your videos made me see it wasn't as scary as I thought (for now). We came all the way from Guatemala to the event and It was AMAZING! Everything we expected and MORE. I also had the honor to sit and talk with @styropyro! These guys are as you see them in YouTube. Completely down to earth. PS: Continue the 101 series! I'm gonna need it.
Nice! There was like every creator from this corner of YouTube it seems 😄
Mark was about to ask everyone to build an atomic bomb in the crunch labs I'm sure of it
ElectroCUTE has gotten really good at the Piano, GREAT VIDEO MEHDI :)
Ah yes, the thingamajigs convention is my favourite
great to see Cody!
I loved this! This makes me kick my self in the ass for not doing what I love.
Wow, amazing. I really needed this today.... I'm smiling so hard my face hurts
For Medhi, all life is a game of taser chess.
Next stop LTX 🚂
i dont want to say i didnt have faith william osman could put on a decent event... just glad it turned out so well
https://youtu.be/3ajADL92vuU?t=416 That's your daughter on the piano ! :) :) :)
crème de la crème united ^^
Where was Explosions & Fire :((
Thanks Mehid. Now I have many new youtube channels in my subscriptions. What a fresh content. ❤
It's funny I'm subscribed to more than half of those you labeled throughout the video.
fake sparks on the chess table is like lipstick on a pig ..
Thanks SOOO MUCH for all the names above everyone's heads. Hate it so much watching videos with lots of other creators, most of which I either don't know or just don't recognize instantly and then searching and wondering who that is. Everyone should do this :)
7:23 - @mehdi: this would be a much better moment to shock in a circle ;)
Not sure what the odd one has in common with maker culture, but i dont mind seeing him around
_"This thing throws disks"_ *cue master of throwing **_dicks_** Michael Reeves*
So many cool creators!
what a crazy amount of makers!
YESS THE EYEBROW OUTRO WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow what a great turnout!
Hey, @CodysLab was there, too \m/
I love you Mehdi
Mark Rober got some free publication of crunchlabs out of it
Wow, So many cool stuff there
That's amazing. Had a smile on my face the entire time seeing all these great people together.
I really wish I could've gone, but it was too far away for me to go. Maybe next time!
Makes me nostalgic for the world fair...
I can label Tom of Explosions and Fire, second last of the big group shot, right side.
This mass meetup is going to ripple into so many future collaborations that otherwise would never happen
Steam sewing machine. Awesome!
It was dream come true for me and my kids to meet you and ElectroCUTE!!!! Thanks for being so awesome!! I hope you can come next year too!!
Oh wow, didn't expect to see Norwalk havoc.
FUCKIN INTEGZA WAS THERE UGHHHHH
Greatest pokemon player, he caught them all :)
Of course Matt Grey is the tallest person in the group photo. :)
omfg this looks like the most amazing convention I've ever seen! I can't believe basically every creator I love were all in one place! I want to be there more than I want both of my lungs!
Amazing! Did you feel star-struck among the real YouTubers? ;)
AHHHHHHH. I need to go!!!!
Jesus loves YOU. He died so YOU can have an eternal life in heaven. True fulfilment, joy, peace and love is found in God. TURN TO CHRIST ✝️🧡
Matt Gray wad instantly recognizable, even from far away, because of his height and glasses)
This was a cool event
درودبرشما لطفا زیرنویس فارسی بزار
Would love to go to an event like this if it weren't in San Francisco. San Fran is basically enemy occupied territory in the US. It's similar to how western Mexico is occupied by drug cartels, it's just that the cartels in San Fran are commies and crackheads (both poop on the street).
I didn't see thisoldTony hands floating around.
I wonder how the wand compares to getting shocked by a spark plug tester😅
Ahhh it was really cool to meet you AND ElectroCUTE!!!
I've recognised 80% of the people you labelled because I'm subscribed to them. What does that mean? am I part of the weirdos?
What a shocking video.
Gotta share the pain for the views
6:45 damn even @CodyHovland ???? One of the most underrated maker channels out there tbh great stuff
Duuuuuuuude did you seriously just out MR. Code Bullet? he's not wearing a monitor!
no Steve?? haha
this video is so wholesome 🥹
The 'who's who' of the building community and Adam Savage didn't show up?
7:34 should have labelled them all as "Not Mark Rober" xD
i like how Code Bullet represents himself!
Thanku all guys you are making YouTube informative useful and inspiring young generations towards science in today's distraction society. Thanks alot you all are science soldiers love u all
Very cool!
Hear me out. Mr.Beast, scrapyard wars type concept with a bunch of mad scientist youtubers.
You really enjoy when people are touching your magic wand :D
This was such an amazing concept. I hope they do it again and I get the chance to go someday
oh my god i didnt know this was happening and i will have so many videos to watch, i guess its good that its summer holidays
the greatest minds of the world in one room. so dangerous... but so exciting!
Love you bro no homo
Commentiquette was there?
مهدی جون لطفا کمی فعالیتت رو بیشتر کن❤❤
Man i wish  could've gone to this, a total dream <#
We are lucky this wasn’t an evil villain convention and these legends have chosen to pursue science for the greater good
The report is as clueless as open source 😁😁😁
Happy to see styropyro is still alive!
So jealous!! Wish I could have attended!
Prostate exam?
Michael really needs to stop twitching and start making robots again
styropyroooooooooooo yeaa
nice video electroboom
7:44 harder senpai😅 You never know who enjoys it till u try lol
If there's ever an alian invasion, and they're outsmarting us, we should not send the military but these guys. ALL OF THEM
Biggest collaboration ever
Evan kale missing or maybe dead
Man I’m so sad I couldn’t make it! I hope they do it again
Great vid, though I did notice a lack of black creators. We definitely need more black people represnting us in this space
Casually shooting Michael Reeves made my day
really hope you told people where the hell you got that idea because it WAS NOT YOUR IDEA, STOP PULLING THE LADDER UP BEHIND YOU. and give those you get great ideas from a helping hand up instead of only acknowledging when you get an idea from another giant channel. Otherwise I am definitely out and you will never receive anything from me but telling people what a fraud you are. This is your last chance, I will be checking this video and ending it there, if you have not mentioned "Join the technicians" channel where you and everyone else has been lifting this idea from.
CodeBullet 😳
You put 100 YouTubers in Marc Rober's workshop and its just as awkward as any other gathering of nerds.
Oh my god, Code Bullet's physical form
I spy Matt Gray(@MattGrayYES) 06:17-06:21
why they wouldn't enjoy? everyone loves a dil... I mean magic wand.
I didn't realize how many of these creators I actually know and follow until seeing this video.
Great meeting you dude! :)
That's an insane turnout! So many creators I like. And then, way more I've never seen!
Imagine mehdi passing thru shocking people with his wand 😉 lol With his iconic music  : bang bang chik a chik a bang bang lol
Don't think I've ever seen a cooler nerdfest out there ever... xD
What a bunch of NERDS! Must have been wonderful.
And now we know what code bullet finally looks like so we can harass him in person to finish the Enigma Machine Build
It was great seeing you at the event. Hope I see you next year!
We have a tesla coil, *moves hand in* " uhhh that's a bad idea"  You sir clearly had no idea who was at your plot 😂
prof brandishing his cattle prod in public the frickin balls on this man.
I love the idea of Mehdi having his zap wand with him everywhere throughout the event.
Great event! I would love to go there one day)
7:43 - PAUSE⏸️
So this is how code bullet looks like
You should mass produce that wand and make a fortune 😂
So self loading as long as someone loads each one.    Hummm....
OH MY GOD! I never thought Code bullet looks like that
Everyone I watch on YouTube was there. Wow what a amazing meetup.
0:23 oh hey!! That robot dog looks very familiar hmmm :)
That piano sounds very out of tune
It's so awesome seeing so many of my favourite YouTubers. And you are all fans of each other. The positivity is great
Wish I could have been there. Too far away and cost was too high.😢 Bring this to the Midwest!
i really wish i could have gone, so im glad to have videos of the event.
If I was one of those kids, getting my project critiqued by the great "Electroboom guy" would have been a highlight of my educational "career".
I'm so jelly!  I was smiling the whole way through!
Oh no, Michael and Mehdi in the same room, that is very dangerous
what is this, a crossover episode?
7:23 Where's Waldo? (Instead of Waldo...substitute any Black person). Good luck. GO!
that event in crunch labs would be a dream come true to be at
Didn't expect to see so many creators from all over the world in one place, and I watch a lot of them.
So disappointed I missed this due to a flight delay! Going to have to make it next year.
💚
Nice dildo, bro.
You kept missing my best pal Ali, the Spags! @alispagnola
My entire subscribed list in one event. Wow
Peter Brown! @peterbrownwastaken oh and Mrs. Brown!! And pretty much everyone I watch, so cool.
Seeing code bullet in your video for only a second was like seeing an anomaly. Love his videos and yours  Keep shocking people, my dude *FOR SCIENCE*
There's is no sign of collision between one YouTuber Shooting video capturing another YouTuber doing the same .
Ooo that event sounds like heaven to me! Such a shame it's hard and expensive to visit US
Gotta love Electroboom for going to an event made for people who build electronic prototypes and showing up with an EMP device capable of wirelessly destroying them
How did I miss getting shocked? Bring that again next year!!!
I did not expect a Code Bullet face reveal
Allen Pan’s legs was my favorite guest
...and most people who recognised Medhi seemed terribly uneasy when he showed up 😬
Many creators have anxiety, I can only imagine through the lens of my own anxiety how difficult it would be to have swarms of people coming at you. People who are also really nervous and/or weird and then that strange effect of _anxiety interference_ happens, where other people's anxiety causes interference with your own anxiety like interference patterns of waves and the vibe gets real awkward. Hats off to everyone for having a great time!
i'd love to see more of code bullet 🤣🤣🤣
it was really fun to see you there! and to get shocked by the magic wand haha!
mehdi i liked this store and it was the best day to meet every youtubers and i love your videos and i am subed
Wow sausage fest 😅😅 Or they just wanted to get away from their other halves 😂😂😂😂😂
Are Elon Musk also there...!
Fun
Designing robots that aim and fire guns is just not a cool or okay thing to do, even if you use nerf weapons.
Never heard of these events b4 but they seem really cool! Hope u enjoyed yurself!
seeing electroboom and michael reeves in the same room and interacting with eachother is like a dream come true i swear, thank you for this Mehdi!
0:49 little tingle shock ...!!! Electroboom : Don't you know I am in use of it.😂😂
Wow all those cool creators, which i knew who were about half of them, looks like i got more to look up now!
You think electroboom would be the one doing teaser chess.
The nerd energy is coming through my screen
This video gives of major og youtube vibes.
1:36 FURRY!!!!!!!!
im glad you brought some energy there cuz dang! for an even of content creators it seemed so dry
Seeing all the science youtubers meeting and greeting is so surreal... like the fabric of space and time somehow warped or something lol
It's great to see Cody there as well. Haven't seen his content lately.
I was not expecting Wren from Corridor Crew. lol
Wow!!! Everyone's there!!! So amazing to see all my favorite creators in one place. The brain smoothies being prepared there must be awesome!!!!
You are a weirdo. I Love it! Don't change!
Strange to see Integza NOT throwing tomatoes at the target.
No Jeri Ellsworth. :(
Bounced on my boys opensauce to this
Oh no. A convention not for just nerds, but for weird super nerds.
wooow cool event👍
My loves to Cody's Lab and to so many others great masterminds
I just smiled for 8 minutes and 1 second! 😃
Can someone tell me how this text animation done and put into edit, which software used by him
I love the editing, the way the names pop 😂
somehow i feel dumb watching all these intelligent people :(
I’m really excited to see the collaborations that come out down the line from this
This is so cool! Like, a convention of geniuses! And possible super villains. lol A convention of creators.   Styropyro and ElectroBOOM, two I admire and also sometimes kinda scary with their genius.  Edit: Practical Engineering, and even Wren from Corridor Crew! Whoa!  Also also, 6:55! Hey, nice playing!
Like a playground for all ages!
Wow. I feel elated that such an event exists. I'm so glad William osmund and crew was able to put this event together. It was soo cool to see all of our favorite users together.
He has become too dangerous to be walking free! Before he used to shock himself BUT NOW HE will shock the SH#T out of YOU too!
Cheers for the ElectroBoom POV tour.  Event was awesome, already planning to attend again next year!
Some of them i know, the others i've yet to subscribe to.
I see TheOdd1sOut likes to torture him self, got shocked multiple times willingly 😂😂😂
This is like what I imagine it is like inside YouTube if you could shrink down and go in the internet. I notice stuff made here wasn't there?
That looked really fun.  I was tempted to go, but just couldn't make it work with my schedule.  If it was in Los Angeles (near me) I definitely would have gone.
I hope there was covid testing to get in this event :I
This is the world fair before Megacorps took over, so much smarts in such a small area!!!
I got reminded of how much of a loser I am
'Allen pan's legs' sent me lmao
Mehdi is a menace
2:00 "thats in freedom units" XD. I cant XD. hahahhahahha. Also it reminded me of the video where you built one, but it shot back at you XD
I wish my life ended up like this
Missing  Grant Thompson,  Long live King of Random
Me waiting for something to explode
I wonder if they had a micro mouse tourney
code bullet really going all out on his ai form there
wait code bullet as a face omg
I hope this event leads to a lot of collaborations!
1:56 "Freedom units" 😆 I am gonna adopt that for everything 'Murican!
Woah, so many creators i didn't know about 😵. Seems like it was a great event.  Interesting how 1km/h is about 0.9 ft/s, assuming that unit is something americans can intuitively work with (or convert from), it will be a useful approximation.
یزیدتو مهدی بیا ایران برات یه سمینار اوکی کنم
ty for all the lableing
Lucky Mehdi met Allen's legs.
free shout outs
I wish I was smart enough to attend and be valued.  Instead, I sit here relying on videos of smart people allowing themselves to take high voltage shocks. Doesn't seem fair.
Didn't expect to see Cody's Lab there. Must have left robo Cody at chicken base to do all the work. Smh
I think you should have bumped the amps on your wand to account for the "people resistors"!  or at least a 1 to arc toast variable setting?
yo, is this your daughter playing the piano? it sounds so professional.
Oh, wow, little miss ElectroBOOM is so big now... Time flies!
wow so many on my favorite creators on the same place, and even more to add to the list! great stuff!
I wish I could've gone to this event, just too far away unfortunately.
and only 99.3% of the streamer's names I did not recognize :-) Great show, great video
Remember when "nerd" was an insult?
This is a who's who of YouTubers I watch.  It's great!
Great event!
Lol Digging. 👍
Love one another
Los Angeles event?   Let us know.   I have some projects..   Downey California ❤❤
that looks so fun
That place looked amazingly chill and entertaining. For some reason I instinctively knew your daughter was TALENTED! I can't imagine where she gets it from! Must be from mom.... -=x JK Awesomeness everywhere! Thanks for the video update and EVERYONE there!
All these people exactly move and behave off camera as I had imagined all the time😂😂😂
styro pyro is amazing
3:35 Am I the only one who sees a carousel of rabbit vibrators?!
I'd love to buy that chess set
These are the kind of creators that should be celebrated, not the likes of the Pauls.
Dudes so humble
They really did get everyone to show up to the event, damn
All my online friends in one place. ❤
I wish I could have gone but it was way too expensive for me 😔
Low key revealing Code Bullet’s face 😂
Thanks for labelling everyone, there are a few of them who i didn't check out before :D
It's a  Coachella for weirdos
Integza a representar os tugas no evento!
Pokémon : YoTube Land
0:03 I thought he was gonna say ohio
Mehdi invited AvE but he didn’t come because he said he was camping but I think he just wanted to not have to show his face.
Thanks for sharing!
I want to go into places like this. But life forces me to embrace "the grey spectrum".
I am a patron of ElectroBOOM, styropyro, Ex&F, Nile Red, William Osman, I made a thing, and Backyard Scientist. I live in the Bay Area. I did not go to this event.  I have so many regrets. 😞
Bruh why don't I have events like this in my country? This looks so fucking cool
Next event is LTX correct?
i must be getting old - all the fast camera motion had me feeling quite unwell by 6minutes  -  longer video - more sedate motion for us old codgers next time please buddy 🤮🤮🤮
Code bullet face reveal?
5:17
the thingmajig convention
Also ElectroCute could never be out shined by an AI coded piano
I thi k i just realized I may have a type (of youtuber)
My least favorite part of your videos is the wait between them.
Seeing Drake alive and finally getting fame he deserves warm my heart
Ahhhh maybe next year I'll hopefully get a chance to go, although I'd be frozen having seen so many of my hero makers in a single day. Also, was that LadyAda on the colourful cart?
کاشکی منم اونجا بودم   لطفا منو دعوت کن کانادا  دستگاهی ساختم که میتونه  ارزنده باشه
Is the wands power turned down some because I remember it frying everything in its vicinity when on
Who kept waiting for Destin(Smarter Everyday) and Steve Mould?
Damn even Integza was there?? I need to visit next year!
Very upset I couldn't go. But if you're going to LTX, hopefully I see you there!
Build a directed energy weapon
I'm assuming you traveled in your car with that NOT taser wand 😅
@0:38 that's not a TASER it's a TENS unit, there's a huge difference there buddy!
Everyone except Adam Savage. Lmao
I'm going to be so mad if it turns out next year is not in my summer break
What do you call the place where all the intelligent people gathers? . . . . . . . Comment your answer here!(fun intended)
yes
iq lvl infinity
That looks like a blast!
I built a Van de Graaff generator for my 9th grade science project. It was so strong it would Ark to the aluminum corner bead for sheetrock. That was a 1968. I didn't use capacitors or Telsa Royal or anything like that.
Major turnout
Took me a minute to spot CodysLab @7:15. I never realize how tall he is
Yo electeoboom! It’s so great to finally meet you after all those funny entertaining videos!
Dropping names like a boss hahahaa😂😂😂😝🤪😊
NATE!! AAAH CODY!!! OMG, SO HAPPY TO SEE HIM GETTING INVOLVED TOO STYRO, YASSS
5:30 wren saying "fuck" just feels so wrong
You kept missing Ally Spagnola!
That´s really funny ! 😄
Hi i want to know What if I made an signaljammer and then I trurn on during my brother playing with rc car ? Then car connection will be lost ?
It was a pleasure to shock each other! Thanks for being the first Taser Chess victim :)
I've been a mechanic professionally for 20plus years and finally picked up my first pocket oscilloscope. I needed to see what the ECU was seeing for a crank signal so glad I did I was able to diagnose a bent crank shaft
When I saw Michael Reeves I expected that you would shock him and he would Taze you right back.
talk about youtube royalty!!!
WHER THE HELL IS THIS
Everyone told you to not jump and it actually worked for a second.
Did he forgot about nerdforge ⁉️😅
It would not have been a good open sauce if Allen Pan’s legs didn’t make an appearance.
This looks like so much fun!!  Damn that's life goals right there to one day get invited to crunch labs with all these people I admire so damn much.
I love the pure chaos of this video
very cool. wish I could have attended. next time perhaps!
Maybe we're missing nilered on dangerous creator panel
I am waiting for styropyro and electroboom collab.  Please Mehdi for the love of unibrow please make it happen. Folks like this and other similar comments to get Mehdi's attention.
that is half of youtube.
Niceeee
You labeled explosions and fire, but you forgot about extractions and ire!
Hot damn! Did youtube even sponsor this event?! Only real inventors allowed!
Damn, I didn't realize there are so many tech YouTubers
I'm so glad to see all these people being able to take time and socialize with their peers! It's likely super tough to do and might not take place for several years with such a star-studded group.
Love seeing all my favouriate creators featured in one video, but man, you can really tell Styropyro loves attention to an obnoxious degree.
OpenSauce is secretly an evil genius meeting, They're in the process of creating the most dangerous Jaeger-sized robot that can shock anyone in a 10km radius.
wow, EVERYONE I LOVE IS THERE
Nerd Heaven.
The way Mehdi managed to be himself and enjoy such a big gather with so many people. I strive to be like him.
Thank you for taking the time to label so many great creators, I knew there were people out there I hadn't yet subbed to!
5:28 did wren say F*ck hehe
there really was everyone from the community
Its like haven for all of us. I love soooooo much every single youtuber you tagged lol. Love you man, since the elctric guitar!
"Most dangerous creators"  Me: Hey, are you not including Explosions&Fire?  Later... Explosions&Fire  Me: Ohno. What have you let loose?
Can't have an event like this without the real legends, Photonicinduction and styropyro.
I would get shocked by your magic wand any day
Just hope he doesn’t test the plugs there and accidently Shuts down the whole convention
You have arrive
Was that Matt Gray there?
After watching William promote this on his second channel for so long, I was going to go but it was too much money :(
Hi sir love your videos ❤❤ Love from India
*NEEEERRRRRRRDDDSSSSSSS!* <j/k>
Who thought it was a good idea to invite micheal reeves? Exposing him to that level of other creators is going to end humanity. You don't invite the evil genius to the weapons expo. Same thing as putting micheal in a room with hacksmith electro boom and plasma channel.
Damn this is like all my fav YouTubers.
Grato!
I guess next up is LTX?
Showing you our coilgun was seriously the highlight of the weekend for myself and the group of friends who helped build it. We're definitely looking forward to next year.
Soooo jelly of all the people that could attend!
So many verfied Creators. I love yall
Integza!!!
Had to choose between picking my wife up from the airport and going, hard choice but in the end I couldn't go!
So nice to see so many people have fun with inventions.  Everyone is just amazing and so nice.
ElectroBoom shows up at a technology event and no capacitors exploded.  Everyone is "shocked". 😂
Not sure if I like this gathering of mad scientists. 😰 Some "people" need to be on the watch for strange happenings around.
Certainly enjoyed seeing others getting shocked.
I  wish I was there to meet you, Mehdi, but it's a long way away from the UK to the Open Sauce event, and then eventually getting shocked, been a fan of your channel for a long time
Didn't you fry bunch of electronics like your lights when you made that wand? I would think people would be a bit afraid of it in expo full of sensitive electronics :D.
It would be a dream to be around so many intelligent people. Someday i will have you all make gadgets for me to take over the world. Well at least a corner of the internet
I was actually waiting for Greatscott.
A friend is just a stranger that you haven't electrocuted yet.
Next LTX.
Hey that was me at 2:23 with the nerf gun! It was a pleasure meeting you! I'm a little bummed I wasn't in one of those shock circles though haha
Let's just admit how legendary this man is for surviving 100,000 + voltage shocks
3:57 *casually stitches*
I get "someone needs to tell mark ruffalo he's famous too" vibes from mehdi lol
You and Colinfurze in the same room together is a recipe for chaos.
2:14 You can see mark instantly like "heyyyy no no no....wait a minute"
My kind of celebrity
lol even CodeBullet gets exposed in public now :D
Major Missing physics girl 🥺
This is a great list of new channels to check out. So many people I recognize or watch already but tons more I have never seen before.  They literally got the entire science/maker YouTube together in one room.  Looks like this was a lot of fun.
That looked awesome!
Man, i wish we had conventions like this in Denmark. Then again, not sure my introvert self could handle it 🤣 @tested where are you guys?!?!?!
Freedom units ... Lol
So.. Code Bullet was real huh ?
I feel smarter just by watching.
Shockingly next event is right in corner, LTX. Hope that you shock some of them again and new people can enjoy your shocking with wand :)
egg
that looks like such a wild event I wish I was there
se juntaron los raritos
Looks like the event was a success!
May be a coincidence, but last video from Code Bullet was evan singing barbie girl, an awesome face reveal
yippee
wait wait wait. ELECTROBOOM MEETING MICHAEL REEVES . THE 2 MADDEST SCIENTISTS MEETING OMG
provoke boy come this side😂.
Insane
Oh man! You met Colin Furze, styropyro, NileRed, Tech Connections, that's so awesome! Was the dude from Stuff Made Here not in the event? One of my favorite creators too. What was Erik (ICE) doing there though? 😂
hahahhaha those lable sounds are going nuts :D
dont get butt hurt by that shocker
Had a meteor hit this place 99% of my youtube subscriptions would have be gone.
funny how there is no black people lol
where was nilered i saw his name but not his face
All are Creative engineers 😍
Very cool
I wish I could've gone, but alas, East Coast with no money
Nice
OPEN SAUCE 2.0 IS A MUST
That has to be the highest density of cool people per square meter I've ever seen  Looks like a furry convention except for inventors
I usually don't like these fair videos but you keep every bit short enough and you give shout-outs to everyone. It's your enthusiasm that keeps the video nice to watch.  One day I would like to visit a maker fair and maybe even have my own stand.
it's always fun to shock people
Everybody is a bit awkward. 🤣
Need to build a contraption that stabilizes the camera for you. still gave it a thumbs up.
That looks like it was so much fun! Thanks for sharing Medhi!
I hope we will have similiar event in Europe too, would like to visit it.
He was so excited to the point that he didn't start the video with "Hi"
essa monocelha gigante tá dando pra ver aqui do brasil
Sad that nile red didnt bring his uranium stuff
One day, he will become Harry Potter.
I'm happy you enjoyed our Coilgun project.  Next year we plan to be back with an improved version!
This video just confirmed I'm a nerd. I know most of the people you pointed out and subscribed to them.
this is bigger than endgame to me
I am shocked that i have watched almost every creator in this video. Seeing all of them in one video truly shows the how big the numbe xis
"Freedom units" 😂😂😂
Imagine a collab with all of them tho
So many crazy people in one place...
I was somewhere in the distance, but no one could really see me.
Why u dont make free energy machines??
Brilliant. thanks :)
cool event  how do you rate it
4:14 That's a legendary lineup.
i really wish i was there
Other people: Wow, look at all these creators! Mehdi: Wow, look at all these new victims!
I am subbed to almost all these people. I guess this is a convention I should consider going to in the future!
Why @StuffMadeHere was not here?
TheOdd1sOut? What's he doing here?
You can say it was a SHOCKING experience
Looks really fun!
If electricity cannot be created so why inventors got titles of " Invented electricity "
The shock wand reminds me of when I figured out how to use scrapped transformers to shock people when in middleschool. I rigged a switch and 9v battery and would shock folks at school. One day I seen a absolutely huge transformer in some computer, it was like a 1 foot cube, my eyes got real wide and I laughed like a villain at the though of the shock that would provide. Fortunately I immediately though better of it as I didn't want to kill someone! Plus I would have been the guinea pig to test it.
shame it's not near me
Haha it's quite universal that watching people get shocked is funny.
The fact Colin furze was also present there just make it awesome 👌👌👌😁😁
I'm praying that there will be another open sauce next year because I wasn't able to attend this one :(
Isnt this called namedropping? :P Nice to see you all had a great time :)
Absolutely great video! It's great that you have such events, I wish I could participate! :D
First ElectroCUTE cameo in... quite some time. Cheers.
Thanks for labeling Code Bullet! I would not recognize him without the monitor for his head.
really like to visit  DIY fairs & local labs  & opensource HW / SW events too :)
high school science fair in movies:
Styropyro and the Hacksmith in the same room?! An Avengers level threat
the feeling you get when you see all the people you have subscribed to in one place >>
I dont know if he labeld Michael
A Michael Reeves collab would be so awesome to see!
I am surprised so many people were there even people i never would have expected like odd1sout.
Cool
Magic wand rules😂😂😂👌👌👌
I may not know everyone, but its sad to not see Bob @ I like to make stuff....
Couldn't see Technology Connections in the crowd :(
NEEERDS!!
Awesome!
oh gosh! I wish I was there <3
Wow all the maker youtubers here ❤️
آخ جون
Wow! So cool that so many people I watch united at one event :)
Freedom units😂😂
5:27 code bullet isnt annonym on his videos ?
Mehdi trying to stop his urge of destroying anything with his magic wand
Is it a fetish to want to be shocked by medhi. NO its an honor.
Lmfao at codebullet 5:28 😂
The people who got shocked by the magic wand and didn't watch the video:How did he made it?
Medhi's childlike joy at getting to shock people is entirely too wholesome. XD
Disappointing to not see the floating hands of AvE ;(
0:13 What is that?  Some sort of airport electrical centre?
Where is the giant red sus?
its missing big clive but i guess he is busy or not available ,also the guy from down under Dave EEVBlog but he is down under so .....
Bring it to the east coast next year! CA is too far away 😭
Wren ❤❤
TheOdd1sOut has never been this fast at drawing and animating since the shock he got at that event. Thanks Mehdi.
I hope you enjoyed
This was the maker version of the avengers
I didn’t know How to make everything was there that’s cool
I liked your old video about an electronic guitar, I made myself the same, but the electric utilities did not appreciate it(
Was looking for stuff made here but he was not there I guess.
So happy to see Cody's Lab there and many other OGs!
That's a helluva nerdgasm right there.
Hey Mehdi , Why Don't you Make A miniature Automatic sliding Door ......... That will be Cool 🔥
So Opensauce is like the evil guys secret meetup
Im disappointed you didnt shock Micheal Reeves
Dude did code bullet face reveal XD
Wish i could have went! Maybe next year if possible
Super
What was that piano piece at 7:00?
thanks for acknowledging the event happened. you did a really good job of bridging the upstairs exclusivity with the downstairs ga. sometimes it felt like the creators didnt want to be on the floor when they could just be upstairs... which is understandable tho due to how many people wanted autographs
So nice to see very intelligent people having fun as children with so much to teach and share! Congratulations!!!
this is the closest thing we got to an irl mad scientists convention
After party at crunch labs 😂
Thanks for taking the time and talking with me on the BATTLESHIP!! My booth was right across from the auto-aiming turrets and  I missed my chance to be shocked :(. See you next year!!
It's great to see fortunate individuals working together as a team. Unfortunately, in my country, we don't have collaborative spaces like Cennimar, where all creators or developers can come together and showcase their projects without ego getting in the way. I wish I could be a part of such a supportive environment. Here, if you are a creator, people tend to be envious and critical of your work. Anyway, on a different note, my favorite musician is Chopin's Opus 69.
OF COURSE StyroPyro and Codys Lab are hanging around together 😁
Is this once a lifetime event?
I’m not famous so I didn’t get a invite
I made it into an Electroboom video! It was awesome to meet you at this epic event!
imagine if all of these guys worked on one project...
@StuffMadeHere ,,, he should have been here
Awesome video i love your content
all nerds in one place 😂😂
Wonder if we'll see Mehdi on Safety Third soon ? He already zapped half of their hosts.
how is he allowed to run around anywhere without osha supervision?
Wish i could have gone, maybe next year!
didn't expect to see wren and nerd forge there !
The thumbnail transition smooth just like the sponsor ads in his vids 😂😂
Hello mudi
Woah that was awesome to see so many of the creators I enjoy hanging out. Keep it up everyone!
Can u please make something like an electrolysis machine or a mini nuclear reactor pls (U can get the radioactive material from rlly old smoke detectors)
Love from India ❤
Holy shitballs, that's like half of my subscription list right there! What a cool event!
Martina was there too (Nerdforge),  https://youtu.be/3ajADL92vuU?t=314
"that's in freedom units" 🤣
firstly, ow. secondly, you basically got a weapon through.
Bruh ima be there next yearm i hope youll be there XD
It looks so cringe. I love it XD
The man has finally broken his HI streak
Yeah boy new vídeo 😊😊💞💞
Mehdi. You have to be one of the most wholesome people on this planet. Thank you for existing!
nifty
Happy to see William Osman 😅😅
WOW, this video made me surprised how creators of this "genre" I'm subscribed to, and a great list for the few that I'm not subscribed to 😅. Thanks for making this video, and it's awesome to see all of these great minds all together, congrats to William Osman for pulling this off, this is the first video from Open Sauce I saw.
4:09 this is like the meeting of the 5 Kages from Naruto, but with youtube engineers 😂
Imagine Electroboom and Michael Reeves collab
Hi
I don't think i realized how big of a fan I am of so many of these people until I imagined being in the same room with all of them. I'd die.
5:25 YEAH! CODE BULLET!
I'm surprized that a black hole didn't form due to the sheer ammound of knowledge in one tiny space.
How is this video better than any YouTube rewind?
I wish i coulda been there so bad. thank you for sharing
good video like allways
@ 7:31 above the guy with the pink shirt and in the back in the middle of the doorway is @Natefromtheinternet also was from TKOR (the king of random)
CODY!!!
i would have loved to get it in europe
I'm wondering why I haven't being invited!?😞you know... I do have feelings and a heart (in pieces now) inside this body...
Looks like a great time. 😀
I saw Colin Furze
so many people I recognize, gotta get there next year!
😮the whole squad is here 😂
a phrase comes to mind "everyone is here"
Glad to see Cody coming down from Mars to visit.
Me who's seeing comment hours ago when the video was released 8 mins ago
I was shocked when he did not start the video with HI. 😮
oh god mehdi is a electrocution dominatrix now, nooooo
Is Nerdforge in the background at 5:05 ?
i wish i couldve gone, it seems like so much fun.
Not tazing micheil reeves was a missed oppurtunity
Nice sir. I think all r youtubers..
so glad that William Osman pulled this off and hope it continues each year as I'm gutted I couldn't go this year!
What de fak ????
You think such an event is all cool and shet until you realize you have no-one to talk about it to after. :V
LETSS GOOOOOOOOOO
I love the labeling with a pop sound. Looks like an awesome event.
Did you catch the famous YouTuber cameo in this video? 😊
CAN I BUY YOUR MAGIC STICK?
4:36 No way my boy Wheatley came back from space to be in this. Looks 100 percent real!
That's great idea to make a cool home engineers come to same place  and show their ideas!
Waiting for the electric shocks, and sparks every video
ഹായ്
Labeling goes hard
I simply got "OMG OMG OMG" the ENTIRE VIDEO 😱  Needless to say I saw many people I follow on it lol <3
I’m so sad I couldn’t be there😢
You're an evil wizard.
omg the who's who of creators, if youtube filmed a rewind at an event like this I would be so thrilled
I do Not recommend making this a drinking game everytime he says “OH MY GOD!”
Hobby!
Creator like yourself? So you took a device that was designed by someone else?
I would like to go there!
opensauce will become the woodstock of crazy scientist
*a dude with more than 5 million subscribers runs after nonames and says that he is their fan, isn't this a parallel reality?*
it was great to see you guys in real life
2:38 technically that's illegal.
I bet there were some WILD "adult toys" at some of these booths. 😏
Love you from India 🇮🇳 ❤❤
« What is it called ? » xD
Super saucy 😂
It was so cool seeing you at open sauce!
Holy moly I didn't know that you can get so many YouTube scientists and engineers into one place. Also lol at the idea that everyone isn't already a fan of Electroboom and don't know who he is.
NICE 👍
mehdi our school needs a new physics teacher pls come
Hi electroboom!
Never thought I'd see Rebecca Parham and Code Bullet in the same video, let alone an ElectroBOOM video... :)
i love your videos and laugh when u shock ur self and get to learn sum
Nerds for life
Sadly I couldn't be there cause I live in Lithuania
Looking good Mehdi !
HELLO MEHDI, HOW ARE YOU
You are a very good Youtuber.
Really good vid as always!!
CoolImma1st
As a someone who has experienced more than one panic attack, kudos to Dan Harris for handling the situation so well. That may have ended much worse!
☠️
...... technically that wand might actually crash a FBW plane.
Notification Squad!🔥🔥🔥
Shii new vid
It was so fun to meet you! I was the one with a large water bottle and you said had a drinking problem.
yipee finally new vid!!!
Damn
Hello from a boomer in Madagascar 😂
should've brought the tazer
No one is safe
208
hi electro boom
I'm glad there is video evidence because with so much that happened over the weekend it all feels like a blur. See you all next year!
I didn't know any of these guys, at the end Cody showed up from Cody's Labs and I kinda know the Backyard Scientist but that's all I know. Ohh, and I recognized ElectroCUTE too :)  Is it me or they didn't react to you like you reacted to them? Seems like they didn't really recognize you :/
Honored to be among the weirdos who enjoyed getting shocked (twice haha).  Great meeting you!
it was so great finally meeting you! getting shocked by you was icing on the cake :)
What an awesome event! So great to meet you!!
Just watching the video I'm envious that I wasn't there. So many recognizable science and maker YT channel creators, all the displays and demos, feels like being a kid in a candy store!
Freedom units 😂 I do approve Mehdi. It was great seeing you there. That crunch labs was awesome right?!
