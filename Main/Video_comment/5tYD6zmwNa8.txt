One of the smartest things you have done is to test and cycle the wipers before installing the arms. If you've ever seen someone run the blades out over a freshly painted hood because they neglected to make sure they had come back to home before installing the arms, you've got the picture! Now, since you are starting to wrap your head around what this brand is all about, you've got to finally repair that PRONUNCIATION!
This is the 9th part of this build, and there are 11 videos of this build.......... Which makes it 9/11.....and this is a Porsche..... that's an Easter egg for you. PORSCHE 9/11
nice job mat
I love Porsche cars .  Don’t have one , but I would love to have one .  Thanks for sharing
What if the vacuum issue is what was causing the GT3RS to keep overheating 16:25
🙄🙄
Yeah as I said in one of your vids before I was right, this car isn't straight and there are hidden defects all over and it's basically a hazard on the road. Not even talking about how bad it looks and you tried to make it something it is not when you didn't had to do that like on all the lemons you own.
❤
I'm with Hannah.  They all look the same and they all look the same as they did back in 1968.  There's a term in politics called gaslighting.  Porsche has been doing this to their low I.Q. customers for five decades.  However, since everybody is entitled to like what they like, more power to them.  However, when you're out in traffic and you see a car with a wing bigger than a Boeing 747 and some dude who appears to be happy as a clam driving it, it just makes you wonder!!  Does that guy fully understand that he's driving on a public road, in traffic, supposedly obeying the traffic laws or does he think he's racing at The 24 Hours of LeMans?  If you do plan to go racing, then by all means do it safely and in a car that looks like it belongs on a race track.  The Cayman fits the bill for that but not for the public roads.  It just looks silly.  Mat is a young guy and young guys like fast cars.  He's doing what he loves to do and we are entertained watching him do it.  Maybe he'll branch out into racing where the cars he builds would be more suited?
YOU need to put some attention to all of the damaged panels under the car. SURE normal sized people can't see under the car thus the thought is why put new ones on.   BECAUSE it creeps me out :—)  and other out there watching but not yet spoken up yet.  The reason you felt at home at Porsche just might be that you have a huge following at your site and this Porsche Dealer knows this and probably is being nicer to you.  Someone chime in,  am I wrong or am I right???  I NEVER see the subscribe button when you say look at it and push it.   "A garage with out a Porsche is just a dark hole" Walter Rohrl - Porsche Development
Never showed the exhaust being fabricated or teh correect wheel hub being replaced ? Never included the suspension parts or paint in the cost
Is JOSH married?
those seatbelts are new, they can't reuse the ones  with pretensioners in them, they have a pyrotechnic in them and when it goes off, it spins the spool backwards to sit you back in the seat and locks you against the seat. You don't want to be flopping around in the car if its rolling or during a crash.  the front ones pull you back in the seat so you are in position for the airbags.
Every since 1987 when the RUF CTR Yellowbird creation, that saved the 911 platform. The 928, and 944 bodystyle was jeopardizing the  911 platform and tge Yellowbird was the salvation of the platform! I was 13yrs old in 1987 and was posessed in the brain with all 911 platforms....and German performance,  along with Audi...saying all this, i haven't been excited for a ride along since the Yellowbird as watching you att the Nurburgring, you have natural talent, the virtual is one thing,but kudos my good man! Let that dog hunt ✌️
I'm happy for you!!!!!
Cant stand porsche, i had one in 1988 and gave it back after a week. Swapped it for a testarossa
Porsche is the best German car brand🤍 Professional and friendly customer support like the one from Solihull is the way to go. Mercedes-Benz should take notes🤨
this guy is great and love the content BUT everytime I hear start a "car vertical" AD.... I cringe so mf hard lol
what a great  colour
Josh was chill
What is that purple Cayman you showed a few times in the showroom? What a fun color!
Hi Mat I’ve got a 2001 Audi S6 which needs some work but haven’t a clue where to start any tips. The videos are brilliant 👍👍
2:40 Happens alot with bosch, they change the partnumber for some reason. just a few years difference in manufracturing i guess, no biggie
Good luck convincing Hannah they look different 😂
The mooaha
congratulations on your success.  from strength to strength all the way!
Is Neil Armstrong one of your ancestors ? 😂
I Don why when I see ur car I feel that It is better rebuild or recreate
How did u fixed that totally destructed car?
I love Mat's work & this video is a testament to others do too. Great job by Porsche. If you were nearer Id get him to look at my car too!!
Brilliant video
how do you get away with no front number plate Mat  ?
1) you’ve got Canadians following ya and we call them “fenders” too 2) you talk weird  3) that car is absolutely stunning 4) just found your channel a few weeks back and you’re quickly one of my favourite channels.  5) 👍🏼👍🏼
Porsche just made its bigger advertisment with this video. It make a difference.
PorschE not Porsch - somebody who owns one should know how to spell it. The last e sounds like the first e in elephant.
Ah yes, a faulty Lambo sensor. Big problem when you're in a Porsche, innit?
Your audio-management definitely needs some work, dude…
i fond a 2013 rolls royce gost whit cooler and black hood co part 126k
A friend of mine got a 2018 cayman S (yellow) for 10k USD down in florida a couple years ago. Car had burnt, he rebuilt it completely. That was his first car. I think this might have been the cheapest cayman S;)
Car turned out twice as nice as it was from the factory👌🙏☘️💯nice work
There is a Copart locally.  This video makes me want to do something stupid ;)       Awesome job
So, Fail.
i hate how companies and people's answer to "i have this problem" is "that isnt possible"  it clearly is possible thats why im calling you?
this is why i love porsche
Great job!
You're forgetting the last letter when pronouncing Porsche
Tech inspections with the customer show you that Porsche exists for drivers.
I appreciate your honesty about your insecurity going to a Porsche dealership!
Well done Porsche.
6 ✅
Foreskin beanie
It's Por"scha     Like what you are doing but can't stand your miss pronouncing Porsche
Great job!
Another awesome epi - Congrats on the PASS
Mike is awesome. Great addition to the DDE crew
You would not get that from Ferrari, they would probably sue you.
please don't say "porsh"!
My german ears hurts everytime he said "porsh" 😑
Its lamb-D-a sensor.
this guy looks like Andrew tate
This is the exact kind of video I was looking for somebody who has the GT3 911 and GT4 RS and give a definitive answer on which car they like better and why and I couldn’t agree with you more.
Wouldnt that be a lift, and not a ramp? Its not even in a wedge shape, that a RAMP would be.  And it literallyLIFTS the car in the air
THE E in porschE is not silent
Good for Porsche and that dealership
Lmfao he hit you with the “7” he doesn’t want to hurt your feelings but he doesn’t want to hype you up 😂😂😂😂
Hannah's the smart one here fs, Porsches are cool but they never needed to make more than the one
Please, it’s not Porch, but Porsche, you need to pronounce the E at the end.
I had to fix snapped teeth once, thing I used paper and tape to get it gripping lol.
Wow THAT was very friendly and fair indeed at that Porsche Center. And GREAT WORK on yours!
Kudos to Josh and Porsche for welcoming a former write-off like that.
„Porsch“ 🥸
This is why rabbit holes were invented
Mate seriously, a ramp. It's a hoist, think about the meaning. Consult a dictionary, words have meanings. Omg it triggered me, LMAO. Its like front wing WTF cars are not planes. You pommies crack me up. Fantastic job on the build. Well done!
Overall an amazing job after a lot of effort! Hannah is right also , they all look the same :D but each of of them is a masterpiece !
Damn Porsches are built cheap af my Camry is way more reliable
Nice video, but please, speak the last vocal too of the word Porsche.
not bad but if it had gone to factory inspection would have been like a hole 40 pages as there are 4 engineers on 1 car loool and there lvls are so high as well but did good to have a mate at porsche look at in
I've been into Mercedes dealership multiple times.  I have brown skin, and I've had to wait 20+ mins for them to speak to all white people before me. I wanted to buy a car ASAP.  I never bought one after that experience. I never went back and never will.
The car is beautiful.  Take care of her.
Ok wow I like signal yellow a lot
Signal yellow? That's traffic cone orange mate
A woipa moia
Buying a Porsche is like buying a ticket to hell
Amazing job bring the Cayman back from the brink. Great job to the staff at the local Porsche dealership for representing the Porsche experience. Loved the video!
FYI A 1964 Impala's wipers do not break when it's icy out.
Signal yellow??? brother that is carrot orange my dude. That is not yellow.
Ali G??
When i was 23 I went to this exact dealer to pick up a 911 turbo s which was in for a service. The staff wouldn't give me the key and asked me to prove we owned the car then after seeing identification they started telling me how dangerous the car is for a young driver at 600bhp. Then they told me to wait outside and someone would bring the car round, i stood outside and walked up to the car as it pulled up and the staff member got out and walked past me like i was invisible, then when i told him it was my car he looked at me strange like I couldn't afford it because i was wearing joggers im guessing, then again refused to give me the key and went to ask inside first. When he finally came back out he also told me i should be careful and looked really confused, i told him ive been driving high powered cars since i passed at 17 and he should mind his own business, really weird behaviour, was almost acting jealous. Obviously i did a full send out of there just to upset them some more
So you bought "the cheapest Porshe 718 Cayman S" just to buy OG parts for it and overpay?
Dont get it twisted, porsches and ferraris still are terrible cars. But nice video.  Edit: No joke, the car vertical advertisement was probably the only useful advert ive ever seen.
PorschE theres a fking EEEEE....even Porsche themself keeps saying it to ya english peeps...PorschE...
Whats the total price tag of the car now, did it cost more than a non-writeoff, market car for the same specs?
The beginning of the video explains why I don’t like vehicles that aren’t from Canada or America because they just aren’t built to last my 2003 gmc still has only 1 major repair with 230k miles and almost everything is stock they’ve very impressive overall though I would still love to own a Porsche
Why does he look like moog
waoh pomp... :D this accent is so funny.
What a talented and likeable young man, hats off to him, what a skillset he has and a lovely attitude to boot!
Fantastic!!
The sound of the engine when it came on was awesome!
Every german car has problems with these lamda sensores. I dont get why they just do Not change this bad Engineering
I was never a Porsche fan until I bought one and started working on it now I love them my favourite cars
"They look all the same." Thats what jeremy clarkson always says about porsche cars
Question is how much did u spend on it? Alot less then just buying one in good shape?
Very cool. Well done everyone👍
Its porsche not porsch, americans mispronouncing german car names just hurts
The vacuum line leak would cause the car to run lean and a lean running engine runs hotter. Nothing to do with the water pump.
The detailed knowledge of the Porsche technician is impressive
Thats orange, mate.   Its like your clarkson thinking his brown aston is orange
the way you pronounce Porsche gives me axiety. its called Porsche. with an E at the end
This is my favorite car in the world. Check out my review of the Porsche GT4 RS and Porsche 911 Turbo S 💯🙄😳
the e in porsche isnt silent.....god fckng damnit
the mow uh
Well done but what a headache
Hi , I loved ur video and how u were able to fix ur own car . I want to be able to do that myself one day. Could you tell me what degree you done for university and how to went on from there as my dream is to open a garage and then open a car showroom where I could fix the cars and even modify it .  I would be very happy if you replied. Thanks
My stepdad let me drive his 356 Porsche & I fell in love with it. Took curves like they weren't even there!
man with flowers tatoo on hands... WTF ..........
Sei un grandissimo! If, for any case, you have to visit Sant'agata Bolognese, I'm the owner of the BULL HOUSE. You will be my guest.
Well done matt.
Great video, great work! Only one subject left: The brand is "Porsche", named after Dr. h.c. Ferdinand Porsche. So the "e" in "Porsche" is pronounced - shortly, like in the word "get". You wouldn't call a Bentley "Bentle", would you? 😉 With kind regards from Germany.
I love your wife how she seems so unimpressed lol lol I recall her repeatedly saying she doesn’t like bmw lol all I kept saying was Hannah thts not just a bmw thts an M5 lol 🙏🏾🙏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Labow
GF is right about porsche's looking the same, there's about 18 versions of the 911, stil  a strong design tho.
Ita Deja Vu or what? The AM Vantage inspection Same seatbelt tentioners that caused issue Company claimed they fixed it and cannot be broke Swapped sides to confirm it was broke Super nice dealership Offered a free inspection The dude watched all the videos before Catches a random stray wire hanging underneath the car Finds a bent bottom plate than turns out is kinda structural A stray vaccum line that was plugged but had it not been, could've overheated the engine. How could that all be coincidence
Just found the channel . I can say this guys a pro.
Hey Mat! Love your videos. Quick question if you have the time: could you perhaps provide the exact color specification of the car? I'm in the process of restoring my old bike and I'd love to have it in this color 🙂
Hi I need help please who some problems. Thanks
what kinda of exhaust is that?
Damn, porsche never dissapoints. Loved the brand before this video, now i love it even more
lambda sensor: i just saved myself 150 bucks
welcome to the Porsche family :)
Mind your own bobber!! Do your thing!! Your  not a knob
You aced it Matt. I never thought you could rehabilitate this car. 😊
My favourite channel now -thanks !
That tech looks like Matt from carwow lol
I'm not even a Porsche fan but I watched this whole video. Props my guy for all the work that went into this thing🤙🤙
wow what a transformation matt ,loved watching the full rebuild ,and thanks .top guy
Hey Mat 😁 i met you on your Trip to Arvidsjaur.You are really cool and i love your content.Besides you seem to be down to earth,what makes you more sympathic. I wish you all the best!!!!!!!! Kind regards from Germany.
This is great, my local dealer(s) are buffoons. I have given them too many times to do the right thing, be professional, they just can't. Glad your experience is different.
The dealership was very nice to you and your car, but you must remember they had a camera pointed at them.
There's  no I'd buy any car he's worked on.  He's unqualified  in everything he does,  and now it's just getting so boring  and childish
I have just binge watched all the cayman vids & really enjoyed them, but i would have been a tad disappointed with 7/10 considering the effort and attention to detail you showed - a fantastic achievement nevertheless.
O If your not happy with this build, there is something wrong with you. It's an outstanding result, I did'nt think you would beat your Anton Martin. I have to say it's up there in terms ofl looks & driving, I've never seen someone overjoyed at the looks & souds of this build,👌
Love that Cayman s wow
I’d love to turn the key, but being in Australia makes it difficult
What is the plan for the front number plate?
I had four children in the hope that one will become ultra rich and be able to buy me a GT3 RS 😂
great class of a dealership for treating you as a welcome customer
I live in Solihull and pretty much go past this Porsche garage daily, it was so amazing to see the car in person, you've done an amazing job. The staff there are always extremely friendly and I've spoke to them a couple of times about a the 992. Looks amazing.
I pronounce it "λ sensor"
It's so stupid that in 2023 you need OBD to figure out what's wrong with the car
Have you tuned the engine yet on this Cayman?  Would be interesting to see if you can match or better the GT4 power as well....
from the horror stories i have heard about other big dealerships they seemed great polite informative and honest always loved persche's now they're also good at selling them ;)
I want to be like you my guy
Porsche in California doesn’t want to work with you on anything on your own. They want you to bring it in.
Hi Mat. How do the Kumho tyres hold up on this? The go-to tyre is Michelin and they so provide awesome grip and feedback but always been a fan of Kumho and wondering whether to give them a try over the Michelin
I saw the yellow plates, thought your from NL and was wondering why you spell Porsche wrong until i realised your british 🙈
The cayman is a boxster doooh!!!  but with a hard roof and please put a bl@@dy front number plate on - porsche engineer should have pointed that out
Awesome job
1 MILLION DOLLARS LATER ON $5 DOLLAR VOLKSWAGEN PARTS
Anyone know how much he paid at the auction?
I watched when you posted the first video and thought no way in hell. 😢 Great job! You give hope to the hopeless 🎉
porch
That went well!
Where do you buy bodykits here in the UK?
Where did he get the Bodykit?
is that front bumper an option on S models? Looks great!
what's QUID?
How much did a the repaire from the wrecked car cost vs price of buying a used one in good condition?
I only saw your gt3 repair videos.  I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD how much of a master mechanic you actually are!!!  Subscribed!
What is a wipa motah?
Porsche Portsmouth were amazing to myself and customer service is 10/10
Man… I now want a Porsche 🥰
If you can’t turn on your wipers when you just have a small amount of frost on the windshield, that is some cheap Chinese build quality shenanigans.  I can turn my wiper on with 10” of snow on top including the frost and it will still work.
What the hell is a Poush?
Why yellow though... sheesh.
It is a German brand and is not pronounced,, Porsch" the e is not silent. It's pronounced,, porschh" the e is slightly pronounced
It's a shame the some people from the staff from São Paulo city, when i was there for the first time they didn't serve us as well as you do in your country.
Josh really knows his stuff. People in the dealership seem really cool too.
Appreciate your work for repairing the car but i have one concern, which is your camera :) Too much focusing problem is going on. I think you should find someone like you but specialized in camera repairs :P
Not like at my local Audi dealership.  Took in an A3 for a service, got overlooked, made to feel inferior and treated like dirt.  Went in the following week with the R8 and the same people were all over my arse.  I was taken on a tour of the dealership and shown around the new cars, coffees and hot chocolate on tap and was given a little bag of treats when the car was ready.  Sad really.
It's PorschE you need to pronounce the E at the end.
Use a big dog crate to ship frame parts in oversized luggage
please call it porsche not porsh
10:12 cassady campbell lol
Well done Porsche very good customer service and well done Mat for rebuilding it.
“As you’ve just heard from Tony, everything’s looking pretty good” 😂 except this is Josh haha and everything actually looks pretty good 🤙🏽
And then there is a friend of mine. He visited Germany (he has family there) and instead of renting a car, he bought a Porsche Panamera. 😮
Mat: You project an infectious vibe that represents true passion for the work you perform. Good on yah, indeed.
A girl who spends half her life choosing which shade of eye liner to wear, has the nerve to say ‘minute differences’ 😐
Welcome to vw word made of Bs my old mercury escape i do alot of snow removal with wipers is heavy never got broken!!!
The nose batch seemed slightly asymmetric glued on?
When Germans cheap out: using plastics inside the wiper motor so teeth can brake off in strong winter 🤪
I love Porsches 👌🏼❤
Your video's are so Awesome , and Exciting!!! And you Explain Everything 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 Names Joe ! Keep doing what you do , its so cool when you get into a build and then get it all built and FIXXED RADDDD!!!! 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Its called Porsche not Porsch
man it just hurts to hear the name of the company constantly mispronounced like this
Porsche is like the iPhone of cars, they all look the same is the extra camera that makes the difference lol.
Changing the whole wiper assembly is so wastefull,  they should sell just the teeth for the motor,  would be cool if you could replace the plastic ones with metal or even 3d print it but at least it was just 30 pounds
To be honest, I've turned my wipers on with 2 inches of ice on the arms and windscreen. That would not be the cause, or at least should not be.
German tv did a candid camera thing with luxury car dealers a while back. Dressed some guy in old clothes, sporting an old Aldi plastic shopping bag. The goal was to get an appointment for a test drive for one of the cars. Ferrari, Aston Martin, Lamborghini all asked him to please leave the dealership, as this was not the place for him. The Porsche sales guy asked him to wait a little and then started to arrange an appointment for test drive.  Later the tv team asked the sales guy why he arranged a test drive for him, even though the guy was clearly not looking like a typical Porsche customer. He told them, that while he might not be able to afford it now, he could maybe do so in ten years, so why turn down a fan of Porsche and future customer?
I will get a porker one day!  I currently sit on the other side of the Stuttgart fence !!
For the part numbers being off on the wiper motor, that's most likely due to the part number having to super seed or change to a new number to allow room for new parts on new cars
Please - the e in Porsche is NOT silent :-)
Por-SHUH not Por-SHH Dudes a car guy and doesn't even pronounce the car brand correctly.
George Floyd took a breath after I told him breath
my ocd was getting to me @ 8:12
Very dificult to sell vechiles with any record in UK. People better just taking loan or lease on used cars to avoid very crappy car repairing made in UK
Oops!  I removed my under tray for something I can’t remember and getting it back on was a pain!  Like the chassis shifted.   This makes sense now!   Should of got an alignment after I see.
Can he not even take the hint from the Porsche people on how to pronounce Porsche instead of mispronouncing it twice per sentence all the way through? All this work and he couldn’t fix that? Bet everyone at the dealership was rolling their eyes. Kudos to them for being this professional on camera.
What diagnostic tool do you use ?
If any of us go to a Porsche dealership with a destroyed car we built ourselves we'd probably get sued and kicked tf out
The car looks awesome. Amazing job.
I still can believe this is the same car you bought. It looks so good. I love the changes you made and it’s crazy how good you are at rebuilding cars. Having them go over the panel gaps just shows it doesn’t just look good on camera but in real life too.
I rly loved the video, very interesting. But for fuck sake, as a German it hurts how u butcher the pronunciation, it's not that hard :(
you are a genius man
It’s a beauty
If i was a billionaire would i drive a honda? Yes, but question is would it be a vanilla honda?
I feel you on feeling like you're not suppose to be in some nicer places. My wife is inked from shoulders to toes and I have a huge beard and look like a lumberjack. But we make incredible money and enjoy buying nice things. It's fun making the snooty types feel poor.
wow I am surprised with the porsche dealer attitude, very positive
Nice Job  done. Respect. I personally would marry the Cayman,  and not the murcielargo.
Being an old 911 owner (911SC) about 30 years ago I nowadays think, that those cars as nice as they look are completely overvalued. I personally jiggle by bicycle through my town, and if I need to get crazy I race my tiger 1050. Time changed
Big up solihull
Mat mate you are so talented and your content on the channel is extremely interesting. Great to watch thank you 👍
I subbed after seeing you bought Adam LZ’d wrecked Porsche and didn’t realize how clean your previous work is. This build is beautiful and I can’t wait to see the next one
guys its T  ,  matter not maaer
None of those guys at Porsche have half the skill set you do. Great video
That car is orange
whypah moah
1:45 or just have a car built without shit quality. Any jpn shitbox Ive had has never had this issue and I lived up  north always turned htem on even if frozen.
Not sure what kind of porshce tech he is but the vacuum system has litey nothing to do with the coolant system. He is flat out wrong.
That is awesome, can you post how much you put into rebuilding it?
I bet that was crazy for Josh to see the videos then be in it. Seems like a good dude in a good place. This was cool.
Dude thank you so much , I've got that same light on my dash that I had no clue what is was or why it was on, talking about the airbag light of course
thanks for the new series to binge
"The more I see them the more I love them" what a fact✨✨✨
You shouldn t have PorshE if you simply can t or don t want to pronounce its name correctly
It was really good of Porsche Solihull to give up their time to contribute so helpfully to this vid - nice one guys!!
free inspection..      5grand please
My experience with my Porsche dealership is that I have never been treated with such respect and courtesy. Over the years I have owned a lot of prestigious brands from BMW up and nobody has the service levels that Porsche deliver to their customers.  I am at the point where I now will never buy anything else.
Haha wonder if this is gonna be a parts car
Open vacuum line will cause the motor to run lean and drive the fuel trims in the +30s. The care would stumble and sound like you have multiple misfires. What's happening is unregistered oxygen is entering the system and being detected by the up stream O2 sensors and telling to the ECM to make corrections, hence positive fuel trim numbers.
My Parents bought 1989 an 924 .. since that Car I love Porsche. Today I drive a 944 in Summer an the whole Year a Cayenne from 2006. NEVER had problems! And the 924 is still there 😀
Who calls it a “ramp”?
You have to order the side window intakes now to make it a full GT4 RS spec
How much did it cost you to fix this?
I'm no expert but if you could have opened wiper part could you relaxed with 3d printed gears or cnc aluminum
I’ve noticed all the dealerships have kind of the same look.
He seriously looks like Moog.
porsche stays in my top 3
It's cool and all but it's so low that it looks broken
Signal yellow.....  What
well the last few weeks i have been looking at getting a used car and the Cayman has been on the list. its now very high on the list. once the bank sorts out the cash. i may have one. best ad for a car compnay ever.
Mate really hope you manage to get the gt3 fixed for a decent price ,I own one as well and someone like you deserves to enjoy a car like this , the hard work will be worth it in the end. Ps , another thing to look forward too is that you won’t have an opf monitor on the US car so when it comes back to the uk you won’t have any issue in putting on a full exhaust like I did and have to mess about with remaps, (I went with just a back box in the end ),I would recommend jcr. Good luck and I look forward to the progress on the next vid!
Dare I say, they seemed to be giving you your flowers considering how jacked it was when you first began the rebuild.
HOW GOOD
At least they're not like Ferrari, where they send you a cease and desist letter for changing anything about their car, and posting it on social media.
OMG "they look all the same" she said??? 😳 Sack that girl
fake video
Lamba 😂
They are so nice if you have million+ subs on your channel
Those two guys remind me of a younger Marty and Moog. That car looks incredible, great job.
That’s a 8.5/10 to me.
You're giving the life back again to these cars, and that's awesome, well done mate, keep going!
Just found your channel off the GT3 you just bought, love the content.
The cameraman should show the part of the car when the guys are talking about that part.
The customers service and talented employees is half the reason for buying one.
Best channel out there, keep up the good work!
Signal Yellow? Man we gotta have a talk about that.
I'm surprised they didn't sue you
If you ever buy a brand new porsche you should get a targa
Porsches..squatted Bugs on steroids..whats not to love! Always hated VW-products, but the old bugs and the entire Porsche brands are just pure passion for carlovers 🥰
I drive past their everyday as i am from Birmingham, big up to matt who's on such an inspirational story, all the best in the future, keep your head up and keep doing what your doing, really looking forward to your M5 being fully rebuilt and back on the road and that killer 911 GT3!!!
Porsche. There is no substitute.
Never have experience with Porsche. Have plenty of with lexus  they go beyond the expectations. I think none can match their level.
I wanted to buy a GT3 during COVID, but the cars were coming so slowly and the economy was so jacked up that they were selling for absurd amounts over MSRP.  So I bought an Audi RS5 to hold me over, which honestly I love.  White on black HREs....Stormtrooper vibes.  But my next ride is the Porsche 100%.
Great work and love the car.....!
There are dealers and there are dealers....   Some years back I walked in to a VERY high end dealership without an appointment.  The salesman walked over and showed me the inventory.  I was almost afraid to touch the cars.  He asked if I wanted to drive one of the Ferraris or the Mercedes.  I was driving my Camaro at the time.  A little taken aback, I passed, but also asked him how he could do that.  I was a nobody and he was going to put me into a $500K car to drive.  He said, we never know who we are dealing with.  Some of their best customers arrive in beat up pickups and ripped dirty clothes.  So they treat everyone the same.  Just today, I went to a Cadillac dealership - with an appointment - to drive a specific preowned car on the lot.  I called specifically about that vehicle and was told to come over.  I got there (in my Porsche BTW) and they told me they do not allow anyone to drive their fancy sports cars.  I spoke to the manager who said the same.  I just walked out shaking my head.  I was an actual customer that they just lost for life.  But just goes to show....
Props to @porsche for helping him out with this. Makes me want to buy one even more. I've always appreciated their vehicles and I hope to one day buy one with the proceeds from my channel.
Just came across this channel and I want to watch the content, but the audio mixing on all the videos I've seen so far needs work. Again, the dialogue is super quiet compared to the voiceover.
Your video is really special. No one has done such a video where a wrecked car is repaired and then brought to the main dealership to have it inspect. It is so interesting and refreshing, especially with tons of car vids out there these days. I've also watched the one on how you made it and I think you are one genuine guy that's worth following for a long time. You are funny, well mannered, hard working, and down to earth. Love it so much. I am following you from today. Keep it up and keep it going!
Fun video. But as a German I have to say it. It's PorschE ;) not Porsch.
Great work bringing that beauty back to life 👍 Every journey ventured is a learning experience 😊 Keep on testing your metal with new challenges bro 👍👍
you do great work
In the USA a rebuilt title car is only worth half of the current value of the car. How does it work there?
Got a new subscriber love ur videos ❤
I have no idea about cars, and I wish I had the kind of skill that Mat has. I just wanted to say, this series has been top tier. Well done Mat!
Where do you buy your cars from
The final result is simply awesome! You built a dream car!

Even though its easy to just replace the whole thing, Powerwin automotive in Australia can repair and possibly supply gears for the wiper motor they even stock wiper pivot links as well as powerwindow repairs from motors to regs. Not sure about shipping between countrys but might be worth a look
OT Sensor is not the same as the Lambda sensor
Next week on Things that are only economically viable if you have a viewership clicking to simply ask why you bothered
I really dream of having a pdk 718. I’d obviously love a gt car but I know that one day a 718 will be achievable.
It’s a Por-SCHE!
but it looks exactly the same!🫤 Porsche: How dare you!😡
Clearly, an Angry Wife made that happen... I just can't think of what else.
0-60 improved by 0.001 seconds by using lightweight plastic components in non-essential locations.
Beautiful colour❤️😀👍
So why do you think you need to talk ig to Porsche as there are plenty of places that do four wheel alignment and can go your air con regas a hell of a lot cheaper than rediculous price Porsche wil charge you. Seems to me you really  just like to waste loads of money on things you don’t need to on every repair you carry out. Think 🤔 it’s called very much over kill
What a channel keep up the good work
Jeremy Clarkson agrees with Hanna, they all look the same.
Any dealership should be enthusiastic about having their business showcased to thousands on YouTube since it is free advertising for them and it's a chance to outshine the competition.....unless you want to commit business suicide by being a pack of tools.  If your work is of  high standards then you don't have to really do much yourself other than your part.
really need to normalize the audio in this vid. Parts go quiet, loud, quiet, loud - frustrating. Nice job on the car though!
Porsche will forever be the best ;)
but they said they knew who you were, they watched your videos.  If you weren't a youtube celebrity they would have treated you very differently
I have never everrrr heard someone refer a shade of orange as signal yellow, decent
Would you like to buy this heap of dishonest  junk.... Should be scrapped.... Would you buy a second hand off this dealer with your honest money????
hi mat just seen your vidoes for the first time and your videos are brilliant and you are brave in what you do so keep the videos coming
Pronounce the E at the end of the word please thank you
vacuum system is used for more than one feature on many cars. it´s not for one single thing only 😄
for me, that´s almost orange, and i like it!
Porsche has always been great to me. Had 0 interest in them growing up, but once I owned one….. I haven’t been able to love another brand since. ☠️😂
My uncle buys all his Porsches from auction wrecked lol. Got a white Porsche spyder for 60k$ USD and repairs it for only 25k😂 with like 2k miles . Drove it and rides like a beast . It was side swiped . Copart purchase
Totally cool..nice job and love your channel   I’m i Scouser living in Scottsdale AZ for 42 years and drive a Racing Yellow 991.1.  Love what you did to your car man 👍👍. Now subscribed and can’t wait for more content !
Better treatment than what you would get from Ferrari
Why do you pronounce it wrong?
I highly recommend buying a 3d printer. Mosy to of your problems looks like to be solved with it!
Just came for a oil change
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16, Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 4:5, Jesus Christ is the only way, KJV....
Why no Gemera? What about a CC850, a Zonda, or a Venom F5? Love the channel!
i just wonder how much to fix up the whole thing?
18:09 Hannah is absolutely right, how Porsche gets away with with charging the money they do for the exact same car rinsed and repeated is hilarious, that being said... the 959 is one of my favorite cars of all time
Love your videos so worthwhile to watch
Porsche (pronounced porsh-uh) not Porsch!  Hopefully the dealer corrected that error too.
Porsche is a 2 syllable word. sounds like “Por-shuh.”
awesome vid
When i was 9 i thought i never can afford porsche, I'm 35 now and i was right al the f time 😂🎉😂
Yeah... but did they do the recall?! Sick car, nice job :)
How much did it cost for the repair?
This is awesome! I just binged this whole series and its absolutely wicked what you do!
Painted the car yelow  isnt it more like orange or is it the video that makes it look orange
Great job on the Porsche. I used to run a tow truck in Canada and have had the opportunity to tow a few super cars and high end cars. Without hesitation I can say Porsche had the most friendly, down to earth staff.   I'm just a tow operator and got looked down on by many dealerships, especially the higher end ones.  But when I went into the Porsche service desk to drop off the keys, they welcomed me like a customer and even offered me complimentary coffee, tea or water while I was there.  As he said, Porsche is a gentleman's car, and one I'd be looking for when it's time for my midlife crisis.
porsche has some bad bitches working there
Wow!  Maybe Chris Harris needs some pointers to get some respect from Porsche!! Absolutely love the content!!
Badge at 8:11 is severely misplaced, please fix it
its just a car who cares shesh
There was a cayman s selling for like 18k where i live. Clean title and stuff should i have bought it?
What wheels are those you have on the restored Cayman?
"signal yellow", thats a funny way of saying orange
i have a Lambo sensor in my volvo also. it going very fast
100k car strips its wiper motor because it was cold and had some ice on the blades? Righto.
What is that purple colour called at 18:28, its lovely
Non spazza via l’Italia se muoiono 3 milioni di persone Siamo in 60 milioni 😐
Lambda sensor
Kudos to the Porsche tech agreeing to be on camera etc, takes balls.  Excellent content as usual👍🏼
Like a little kid in a candy shop
Lemme just say I'm a Roblox player and the thumbnail looks like driving empire
That signal yellow looks awfully orange.
You reserected a dead Porsche. Im sure they had respect for you. Instead of parting it out and scrapping it you put it back on the road. Much more love than what Tesla wouldve done. Good job keep up the good work.
I couldn’t watch anyone that did that to their ears. Disgusting.👎
That is not Signal Yellow lad
so weird that the English would call a lift a ramp when there's no ramp involved
Its called "Lamda sensor" from the Greek letter "L"
Great vid and I love the Porsche
I did the same with an M6 and it feels odd walking into BMW.
Did he really say he couldn't get it high enough to do an 02 sensor with a scissor lift... you barely have to lift the car at all for an 02 sensor lol
Yellow? Are my eyes broken thats orange
This guy is a master mechanic, european, and doesn't know how to pronounce Porsche properly? SMH     It really bugs the shit out of me when people don't pronounce names properly.
Aftermarket bumper and color destroys any Porsche's value
Will never be a 10....it holds the dark secret...
People used to laugh at me when I used to record parts numbers for old British cars. But what I knew was that you could find some parts for say an Jaguar, that wouod easily something like a big old Austin. And that was when they were separate companies. These days, its usually either the same automotive group (Ferrari, Fiat, Alfa) or the manufacturer has a collab (here's looking at YOU Merc and Renault (RNMA),) or its the same 3rd party OEM off-the-shelf part. Engineers try to find parts already available by say, Bosch, to put a different sticker on it. As example, I used to use Ford indicator relays in old Porsches simply because it was £13 cheaper with a Ford sticker but the exact same unit. There's always work arounds.
Excruciatingly poor color choice, but it does match Mat's voice.
Love this vid
clearly manufactured content. the 02 sensor being unplugged..... yeah.
I visited my local Porsche dealer last weekend. I was completely ignored... I guess they either figured I'd ask if I wanted anything, or I looked like I couldn't afford anything. I guess I did turn up in a twenty year old Merc. Problem with living in a tax haven is they have no shortage of customers so don't need to waste time actually being nice.
I love Josh because he spells Porsche right, as a German it hurts everytime someone says it wrong
I always used to use glazing plastic packers to get door/ wing gaps ect level all round..... made panel replacement so much easier. Nice job Matt 👌
Porsche are so particular- yet their engines tend to need rebuilding every 80000 miles even if meticulously serviced
“Your not a gentlemen” 😂😂😂
someone said "where is my lamb sauce", now we get "lamb sensor"
Absolutely awesome job done on that Porsche mate 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼.
That turned out amazing!!!
You all have to understand that you only buy shapes, not another type of technology in the field of mechanics. These exterior or interior shapes you call them design, but the mechanical technique, you also use the one that was conceived 150 years ago, only with small innovative transformations.
What an amazing color that is.
Nice rebuild - can you now pronounce Por-sche (2 syllables) correctly?
Excellent job! The car looks better than new.
Nice vid. Btw it's pronounced PotschE 😂
Of course the trained technician noticed the obvious terrible flaws in the dreadful death trap.
1:45 wanka
junk
Is PORSHÉ ? Very good vid at least you had it checked which cowboys do not like me.
Would it not have been quicker to load test the wiring from the airbag module connector to the pretensioner connector?
Am so impressed bruv
So what this proves, if we even need proof, is that companies like Porsche will charge you X amount for a cayman wiper linkage, but charge a different amount for a Boxster linkage when it's the same part, this is why they don't tell you anything, not even for basic maintenance.
Fantastic job Matt your attitude and personality is what got me to subscribe to your channel.
This video actually helped me out because I actually didn't know that the O2 sensor effected gas usage. I've need a O2 sensor for the last few months and have been putting it off because of price but I will probably save money by fixing it.
Still, gotta be very cautious about rebuilt carwrecks, the rule of thumb is to avoid them like the plague. A Porsche dealer dont know ANYTHING about what will happen 30,000 miles down the road. Statistics dont lie, rebuilds are a game of chance.
Wow,  this has changed my views about Porsche too. Nice video 👍
Love a cheap Lamba
Porsche.  Cheap(ish) spareparts, all bolted on with 3 very accesable screws that doesnt need special tools, free inspections,,  Porsche is the drivers car..
Makes me want aPorshe!
Weren't you tempted to get a metal part made for the motor so it wont break again? UPGRADES! Lamb-Dah! How come you didn't go Porsche Nottingham? Its much closer to you. Dropping 30% of the max score seems harsh for so few issues. Like the people on come dine with me who give a 6 becasue someone didnt mke their own ice cream... You're a proper Petrolhead Mat, not surprised when proper mechanics give you the respect you're due you LEGEND.
What you said about how you’re treated is standard now. There was a time when luxury car dealers were like an old boys club where they’d turn up their nose at someone who doesn’t fit ‘the image’. I watched something on Bentley which featured Jack Barclay, the main dealer in London and they said that they literally can’t afford to do that because of how things have changed with footballers, pop stars, YouTubers etc that don’t necessarily dress in a certain way but definitely have the means to walk in and buy the car
So you tried to fool a professional. Next you will fool a amateur buyer.
porsh * ahh.  The 'e' at the end is not silent.
Top money pit !
Love the look of this car! Only started following you from M5 rescue video ..Your videos very engaging to watch !  Keep going Mat 💪
Sorry Lads but i can only give you 11 out of 10😜 amazing work lads better than factory.
I really loved how the Porsche tech observed your video on the Porsche so there is an instant link. They are a really cool staff. Love this video 🙏🏽❤🎉🎉🎉
How much did you spent in total?
Really enjoyed that ☺️
When you have 1 million subscribers everyone is nice to you.
a whole showroom of overpriced VW Bugs. who would have thought
Bro all the oxygen sensor does is tell the pcm how much oxygen content is entering and exiting the catalytic converter it doesn’t tell the pcm anything about how efficient the fuel is burning
THE B IS SILENT
Why does signal yellow look orange? Am i colorblind?
Had no idea the drummer of twenty one pilots liked to rebuild cars!
Do  you drive a Porsch ? Na ye don't .There is a google translator  when you spell Porsche in it you can hear the companys name. Just imagine what you would call germans if they were so arrogant and call Chevrolet Chevrol or whatever. We could also skip the last 5 Letters and don't name it anything. *P O R S C H E* is one of the most well known Brands. But Americans know how to speak yeah 😞
Can you please buy for me a key programmer I would really appreciate it🎉
Many congratulations on a big thumbs following an inspection at the Porsche Workshop. All your hard work & determination paid off, and you now have a fabulous looking GT4 Cayman that you should be proud of. It was a good idea to delay the alignment check until after the replacement chassis 'brace' has been fitted.  Boxsters, Caymans & 911s are all very sensitive to wheel alignment, and having all four wheels aligned properly will make a big difference to how the car feels, responds and drives. Keep up the great work! 👍👍
I own '89 959 and '18 911 Turbo S . I don't know why but I feel like all the other models like boxter, carrera, cayman, etc.. are totally unnecessary  😅 911 for life :D
He gave it a 7. Rookie score; everybody knows the rules
I must say, considering how Tesla is so ignorant to Rich rebuilds because he fixed some up. Porsche was 100% excellent people. They are very respectful and helped you out a bit. AWESOME.
Porsche lady is absolutely stunning
Brilliant video! Such nice people at Porsche, I'm a big Porsche fan and videos like this only reinforce what a beautiful brand this is! I still have small children, so a sports car is not practical .. but someday, someday .. When the kids are a bit older .. There will be a Porsche in the driveway! ;)  And Met, what a good job you did with this Porsche, thumbs up!
Such a cool build
999K subs right now. How good would the feels be to be the one who clicks it to 1M.  Well done, Mat. Appreciate your YT content hustle!
Thank you for bringing that little cayman back to life :)
Dam this video gives me memories of working there, by far one of my best jobs I’ve ever had, the cars and coworkers I had made my experience a 10/10
What year is car? and where did you purchase GT4 front bumper
That's terrible fucking engineering on the wipers. My 94 Jeep Cherokee's wipers moved 8 inches of snow off the windshield without breaking a sweat.
I too have browsed my local Porsche dealership and never felt like they didn't want me there. I've even told the sales guys I'm about to completely waste their time, so if they've got better things to do then talk to me please go ahead. They always stay. Only place I've ever felt ignored was Mercedes-Benz. Porsche truly rock. Great video!
I can't believe all these years later you're STILL dying your beard. Own the red brother
So close to home nice to see
Great job!   A bit of feedback on the video editing though, equalizing the audio would help drastically, I found myself constantly turning it up to hear the voices, but then scrambling to turn it down with your voiceovers/music.
2k from 1million subs! Can’t believe how quick you got there
This dude I think is speaking English….. I’m not positive though
Loved the blue one in the show room oh and a great vid too your porsche looking real sharp bud
Love the car man you’re doing a great job. Keep up the amazing work.
That Sunroof at the end is like something straight out of Cyberpunk2077.
ALMOST a Mill subs congrats, supported u since 30K subs, We will hit it soon!!
Smart move for Porsche getting free advertising and being good sports about the rebuild
pretty amazing rebuild
My Ford Wipers Work Everytime  In The Frost... WITHOUT FAIL!!!
Take a typical 50,000 mile 6 year old example of any car into a main dealership for a 'by the book' inspection, and they will find various stuff wrong. I reckon this is car is in the same ballpark overall as any similar age and mileage example that's been used hard. Considering what you started with, it's amazing work. Fair play to you.
Now do it with a ferrari 👁️👁️
I’ve never had a bad service experience at any Porsche dealership. After using multiple locations, they’re always very nice and accommodating, whether you want to be treated like someone who knows nothing or you want to see your car on the lift. Of course I’ve had Porsche service chase down some gremlins once in a while and it’s never fun to wait for your car and all that…. But that’s not the fault of the service team itself… they’ve always been great to me. That said, I work on my Ferrari myself LOL
We done for chasing your dream of owning a Porsche.  Hard work and perseverance pay huge dividends.
I believe that is a Porsche dealership and not Porsche the manufacturer, big difference.
its nice , i think the handleing will be its best trait being a renound track car
Just want to say amazing job on this car. There is so much going technically in a Porsche, the fact that you got so many things right rebuilding is just incredible, and shows what’s possible with some skill and shear drive to make something work. Not sure what your background is, but I would say you’ve got some fantastic skill to make this thing turn out as well as it did, the car was such a mess before, truly impressive….congrats, beautiful car 👍
that's such a cool dude
Gt4 body kit u know what's up
Oh no a recall because a scoop is too big.... 😢 RIP the rest of us
Couldn't understand a word you said are you from jersey
The check engine light will come back on. Over and over and over again. Porsche is known for that.
now imagine this video but with a ferrari dealership
Just found this channel today and I really enjoyed the content 👌
Fair play to Porsche Solihull for accommodating you guys.
the guys @Porsche pronouncing it PorschE. Which is correct. I'd love to hear it correctly from you as well mate from now on. It isn't Porsch... :P
Looks a like a really good Porsche dealership, they are not all that friendly and welcoming I can assure you! If you don’t drive the latest kit they look down at you!
Fake it till you make baby. This is the biggest lesson I've learnt from this Youtuber. Killer results.
Brilliant
I haven't seen the other videos on the Cayman, from here i can see you did great work on the car, Porsche Solihull is a top notch dealer and glad to see they treated you and your car the same as any other customer, i worked for a few high end import dealers in my day here at home in Canada and can say that some are good and some not so good, i can say for sure that some of the prices you have mentioned in the video are far more reasonable than what you'd pay here in Canada even with exchange from Sterling to CDN dollar which is about   $1.70 in your favour , great video and look forward to future ones on the Cayman, new Sub
For as much as you seem to be into this car, I’m surprised at how you mispronounce the brand {POUR-shuh}
Took mine there they are great guys
Nice one Matt. Also great to hear you pronounce Porsche correctly LOL
Porsche are junk
1:20 "The mo 'or" 😆 Love it lol
Hi Mat, Dave-in-France here. This is the first time I've looked at your channel and what a GREAT video this is !!! You've obviously worked really hard and with great skills to get you Cayman looking gorgeous. Very well done. Dave
Beautiful car hopefully I can get a GT3 someday
ITS CALLD PORSCHE!! THER IS AN E! NOT PROSCH
Porsche dealer ……license to print money
Did Porsche appreciate your hoodie?
Those parts are so cheap. We get ripped off in Australia, that 80 pound tray would be 200 pound 2nd hand in Australia at least
Looking good, love the paint and wheels
Awesome video!
Hearing him pronounce the lambda sensor is "lamber" is so painful
Mat nervous because Porsche will check his Porsche. Porsche employees nervous because Mat will come to them. :D  But first Bentley, then Aston and now Porsche. Seems like you became a big name in your area with car dealers and they like your work on their cars.  Curious if at some point one of them will partner with you for a build and grant you discounts for parts.
Idk if it's just me but how is that considered yellow when it's clearly orange
He says Porsche is not a showy off brand, while his Porsche has yellow seatbelts......
I’ve never seen a car crashed so hard that the O2 plug was ripped out of it’s socket by inertia alone. 😳
Loving the content all the way from 🇿🇦
People should consider buying porsche, instead of buying cars that you’ll end up being sued for dressing up the car you bought.
IT'S "POR-SHUH"...
Hi Mat Great Porsche Cayman build thanks for sharing, can you please let me know what  Wheels and rear spoiler is on your Cayman? I want it for my Cayman ;)
Now if you would only pronounce Porsche the correct was all the time. If you talk about them in plural you say it correctly. 😉
You should put a V8 in a Porsche to make v8 great again 😂
Love how happy u still over saving 120 bucks on the sensor after spending 50k on the car! Still so grounded dude 😎 stay that way pls 😘
Luckily it wasn´t a Ferrari, they would have looked at you and said, ``You bought an Italian made car, are you crazy?´´ ;)  Great job!
LMAO if only tesla did that with the panel gaps.
Massage me if u want me to sort the cat N ... any thing is possible just saying
Dude has the daniel ric vibe.
First video I've watched and I was so entertained.  Like a book you cant stop turning the pages, I just wanted to keep watching to see what happened next.  Great content
Strongest English accent ever. Sounds fake lmao but loveeeee the porsche
Great job!  👍
I'm not a fan of Porsches - in fact, I really don't like them. That said, you have built a Porsche that I would be happy to own and drive. Hats off to you, Mat!
I gave you a 8
love the colour
I've had a look around Porsche Solihull and they do seem a friendly team. It would be interesting what they would value your car at.
looks like nottingham
I spent years literally restoring classic porsches and doing some pretty insane builds and efi swaps and tuning. I despise porsches. Absolutely despise em. AUDI was the best of the VAG family🤣
Meanwhile at Ferrari they would lop your head off for this lol
Ok that ad transition was smooth. Not even mad about that. Kudos to you
Now I'll give you 20k for the finish product
if you did this with a tesla they'd kick your ass out immediately
If I had money, knowledge, and ability to rebuild it, then yes, who wouldn't buy it?
The underside of the car looks bad compared to the top.
The shiny side looks good, but the splash panels underneath tell the story. The bottom of the car tells as much or more than the salvage title. Your paint and panel work is excellent.
That Porsche looks amazing! great job! 08:19 I don't want to be 'that guy' and probably it's perspective but it looks like the badge is slightly off center? (towards the left from the camera pov) The Porsche mechanic didn't mention it when inspecting the exterior, so probably just perspective that makes it look like it's off center.
i own a porche cayenne. they are great cars. lovenyour videos. it was a very smart move from porsche to give you for the mistakes you have done. it makes a brand loyalty of mine to a higer level. keep repairing porsche :)
Nice! what's the status on the M5
This dealership makes me want to be a porsche tech.
Matt about to hit a Million subs!  So glad to know I am part of the community. Shoutout all the Way from Sunny Johannesburg South Africa.
The "e" at "Porsche" has to be pronounced as well.
mo'uh
Porsche are the best wide stance,   they rock for life. Great channel thankz
WILL THS BE RAFFLED OFF?🤞
@11:35 The technician is allowed to go in there too?
This is how a car company should treat its customers, great job porsche. This is probably some of the best advertising a car company can do, makes me want to buy one.
I'm not a car person, but having watched this series, I'm genuinely impressed. You have earned my respect!
That is such a good colour 👍
Nice 👍🙂 So; what did she set you back in total?
The wiper motor numbers are different as the Boxster wiper is only rated to 145 mph.  The 718 is rated to 165 mph.  Psych!!!
Love the colour.
Holy...you almost have 1 millions subscribers! When I follow you, it was like 300k subscribers
I have a cayman 981, do you have any idea where to get a good quality gt4 kit like yours?
It should be illegal to use plastic gears on any car, particularly a Porsche.  They’re saving pennies and milligrams to create future hassles.
Don't do it with Audi if you know about cars they hate u
It's not just the quality and performance  of the car but the overall demeanor of the dealership towards a customer, which brings the customers back for years to come.
I've heard that the dealer has a computer that they can hook to it and they can clear all bad codes after they fixed it , So your car's computer wouldn't think the things are bad.
Im New to the channel. It's great. And big props to Porsche and Josh for being honest with you.
This is a PORSCHEEEEEEEEEEEE not a Porsch!
Why do you say Porsch to your Porsche? Is it like a nickname? I mean I know that for example Lamborghini is also called Lambo but calling a Porsche Porsch sounds like you call a Lambo a Lamb, isn't it?
Great vid Mat. Goes to show that mechanical training,experience, knowledge and attention to detail that pays off.
Well done Matt, but if you are going to be a Porsche guy, learn how to pronounce the name. Por-Sha
It is not wipah moor. It is wiper motor. With r and t.   Also not op there. Up there.
Absolutely love you and your videos Matt #oneofakind❤
PorsCHE not Porch
Thats orange aka fluro orange.
is not orange ?
Great work Mat.
You can hear the Mo er 🤷🏼‍♂️ I don’t think it’s going to ma er 🤷🏼‍♂️ Connects oop there 🤷🏼‍♂️ Un plooged 🤷🏼‍♂️ Bof sides 🤷🏼‍♂️  what language is this 😂
Plastic teeth on a wiper motor?! GM does better, and GM does some dumb stuff.
I don’t like it
Hey Matt. This is one of my favorite rebuild. This Porsche is awesome! As a Porsche enthusiast, I hope we can rebuild one together one day😏😂
Lamba sensor.... wth
Nice job mate.. If they didn't know you might have been a different story, hope not, but BMW are notoriously bad customer service! I've had RIDICULOUSLY bad CS from BMW as a previous New Car Buyer from the and owning 2 3 series got THE WORST EVER Treatment from Sytner Chigwell BMW! Returned my car broken on a low loader no warning just took the courtesy car back and failed to fix the problem it went in for which was down to their shoddy workmanship in first place ABSOLUTE disgrace!  Wouldn't mind a Porsche though.. 👍😎🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧
Porsche is pretty cool
nice vid.. but one thing from a german user.. everytime i here Porsch.. it made my hackles rise.... :-) Please please its pronounced like "paw-shuh" or "por-shuh".. the E after the SCH is not silent in german ... keep on :-)
Ummm was that thing able to drive under its own power??? 0:35
When is the new video
Rotten beard dyer
Why do you call it "Porsc" it is pronounced Porsche just as it is spelled :D
I didn't realize British people call a hoist a ramp
Take that Porsche to a TÜV inspection in Germany.  You'll get a list of what's not in Ordnung.  🤣 I took my car (not a Porsche) to the TÜV inspection 2 weeks after the dealer's 200k km service and maintenance.  Everything was ok but TÜV disagrees with the dealer.  😂
You're a funny guy, and you do great work.  How cool is that... that the Porsche guys knew who you were and followed the progress of the car!  I'd love to know how much time you put into this project... but otherwise great stuff.   Also love your accent.  Great job!!
They didn't treat you bad cause your giving them free advertisement....
The cars are there but you can't change yourself
They rated it a 7/10 you’re welcome.
the only issue i see are the body lines but other than that it looks great
Porsch vs Porsche
bruddah the inspect was biased
The car would not overheat if those exhaust vacuum lines are leaking. It would run lean because of unmetered air entering the engine, and you would probably have a check engine line bad enough to put the car into limp mode.
Nice work, only thing I'm not sure about is calling a hoist a ramp 🤣
Sorry mate, it is not called "Porsh", this nice car is called"Porsche". I do not know why a lot of Brits saying it wrong. Every American says "Porsche".
You mention being pleased and surprised by how well you were treated at Porsche. I heard that luxury car dealerships in San Francisco learned to treat everyone as their best potential customer ever, because you simply cannot judge a book by its cover. A grungy looking person might be a multimillionaire rock musician, for example. It happens, and you just never know. Cheers.
Porsche is a two syllable name. PorSha it’s a family name. You would not continuously mispronounce a persons name if they corrected you. It is not a choice in how to pronounce it. Your Porsha looks great
Much better than my first and only experience at a Porsche dealer in Philadelphia, PA. I intended to buy a Porsche that day but no one approached me or would talk to me. Dummies. But that experience in 1969 or 1970 taught me a wonderful lesson in customer appreciation. I insisted my employees greet everyone promptly, answer phone calls by the third ring and return messages ASAP. CUSTOMERS APPRECIATE THAT.
not really knowledgeable about cars ,  but i stumbled here randomly and i love jt
Carvertical is a fraud in itself, I seen several people distance themselves after realizing the wide majority of cars don't have meaningful reports, if it ever contaisn something, damage report cost numbers are often completely unrealistic, and of course if a damage wasn't checked by insurance or dealership it's not going to be there. Of course there must be plenty of money in it, I am just surprised to see some people still endorse them...
does anyone know the total amount he spent
You look like andrew tate but if he has hair
Greetings from Brazil! Your Porsche looks better that those on retailer 😅😅
neato
It would be so lovely if you learn how to pronounce Porsche.
Great job Mat! I'm just some random dude in California, but I'm proud of the work you've put in on this car and how well it's turned out.
If you want a real inspection done bring it to a Porsche certified repair shop. Most dealers aren’t certified meaning they don’t have the proper training and equipment for structural repairs.
They jumped a curb.
It overheats with vac line off cause it will be lean... lean is hot... high performance stuff is on the limit already, any leaner, causes issues..
If you are going to own a Porsche, learn to pronounce the name correctly. It’s Porsche-a
Hits Porsche steering wheel re-evaluates his life rq
local porsche tech here to say the name is a two syllable word LOL
I would give anything to own a Porsche, or at least drive one for a few miles.
Sorry I am brand new to the channel and this came up in my feed. At the beginning of the video he said he needed to do "structural repairs" but that carvertical report said it is a category N which a quick google search means it was written off without structural damage? Am I missing something here seems like the report is off? I could be wrong though. Seems like you wouldn't want to show that if you are sponsored by it.
That's what I love about Porsche, u never know what it looks like before or after a accident.🤣
Good job. Porsche people are very nice I've found.
It’s crazy that a 18 year old like josh knows so much about a Porsche 😅
Hi mate I purchased that are check and it didn’t work like that kind regards Mem p.s love your videos 😊
Impressed with Josh. He did his employers  a favour//// Nearly a million people watched his efforts which are to be commended. And as for Mat, it shows just how far he has come along. My only personal criticism is I do not like the New York taxi paint job. Sorry Mat.
Really enjoyed the video! There were a couple parts where Josh was talking away from the camera and it made it a little hard to understand what he was saying at times. Would it be possible to do captions for some of the more mumble-y/quieter parts? (American viewer, I am also not accustomed to the vernacular)  Still, loved Josh!
This word: Porsche Is 2 syllables
I love the GT4 Body Kit.
PORSCHE... not poorsh.... JFC what is it with you ! Say it with me POOR-SH-AH
Wow you call lifts a ramp? Interesting… when you said ramp I figured you meant a pit which would make sense given how low the car is to the ground.  But it’s just a lift.    You guys invented English right?  I’m just messing with you.  Awesome video BTW. 4:22
Ferrari or Lamborghini?    Porsche!
That body kit makes that car.    👍👍
Great video
Ferrari could learn a few things about how to treat customers who work on their cars/modify.  In no way do I see it "devalue" the brand like Ferarri seems to think.
Great fix and a sick paint job. I would have never thought a Porshe will look so good in yellow.
Great video. I can especially relate to Mat's comment about "feeling like I'm not supposed to be there".  I remember feeling that way when I wen to a Porsche dealer while I was in college.  Just a young kid with a lot of debt.  The staff obviously knew I couldn't afford the cars, but they spent a good hour with me and explained why their cars were special.  I've always cherished that first encounter.
The ear things are a distraction, the volume is all over the place, you need someone editing your stuff properly !
A man that hides his hair that much 😂like it’s ok bro just stop over coloring your eyebrows
On my Saab convertible, they have 2 airbags in the back that shoot a rollbar in the back of each seat, it's not a safety issue because it's not required, but it still shows as a airbag malfunction smh
Still can’t believe Mat hasn’t hit 1 Million subs yet, love the content mate!!!👌🏾
Still can’t believe Mat hasn’t hit 1 Million subs yet, love the content mate!!!👌🏾
Why any english speaker say Porsch? It is Porsche ^^
This is actually very cool.
I love that colour
Another "Porsch"-Guy
You know.. I’m not really a Porsche guy either, but seeing how they treated you, makes me wanna buy a Porsche.
Love the video, you need to level out the volume. When you are talking with the tech it is super low and then it seems like you are yelling with the voice over. I have had to play with my volume like crazy.
Congratulations on a job well done
British L
That's orange
Josh quite sharp :>
Please learn to correctly pronounce the Marque of the vehicle. There are TWO syllables in the word.
Welcome to the Porsche cult! Once you’re in, you never want out. 😂🎉
That's the most bloody complex engineering of any car. Vacuum leak causing overheating?? Removing/replacing a skid plate ruins a wheel alignment?? It's mind numbing.
2:08 Um, why were you surprised the wiper motor gear was plastic? I’m actually surprised that you assumed it wouldn’t be, especially since you attributed it to a cold weather failure.
Fun fact:if you want a porsche at a cheap price, then buy a used porshce cayenne, which is actually pretty sad since a porsche cayenne has higher building quality than a boxster yet is cheaper than a boxster
OPEL
I feel like porsche dealership is the best out there.
A WYPA MOTA!
Why make the teeth plastic????
Fucking awesome video dude, super impressive.
the way you spell Porsche make me crazy xD
👍🏼🛠🚙
I wouldn’t have bought a cayman in the first place………
I hv 2 agree they all look same..
0:21 that dent was from the angry ex GF of the previous owner. That's a "I'm angry we're breaking up so I'm taking a bat to your car" dent.
Posche is written with an e so speak it bruhhhh
Most wiper motors have plastic gears, but they also will blow the motor fuse before damaging the gears if the blades are frozen. But that's for cheap Toyotas, not $80,000 German luxury  cars.
That Cayman is night and day from how you found it!  The signal yellow looks almost tangerine in the video, definitely has a stronger orange component than traditional yellow (especially compared to the seat belts), maybe that is just how it comes across on video  - regardless, now that you have done the repair work - it looks sick (inna good way)!  Great job here Mat!
she's not wrong, they are all the same xD
Massive congratulations Mat, am sure the Porsche team in Solihull felt proud to be the ones checking over your work!
It's a PORSCHE  not Porsh!! You managed to rebuild a whole Car but not once learned what its name is! It makes me furious to listen!!  P O R S C H E
Congratulations for your beautifull build. i'm more the italian car Guy but that is a beautifull machine and at Porsche... that is the real customer service.
it's orange right?
6:51 drink or drive, why choose?
"In signal yellow" cracked me.
Porsche dealerships are the best!   As a kid remember going into the sealers ogling cars, and porsche always let you sit in them, and they talk to you.  Still great when you deal with them years later. 😁
great ....
been following this cayman series!  fantastic videos. you deserve millions of subscribers!
amazing transformation one of the best car revivalists in the world, keep doing what you do Mat!! 👍
Wtf I’m German and that’s the weirdest English I’ve ever heard WTF. IS A WIPHA MOTÖÖHH???!  2:22
Porsche.  Not poorhsh
You've spent so much time with the vehicle and you still can't pronounce PorschE correctly. Best regards from Weissach :)
My hero! Such hard work paid off. And I even like the colour 🟠 Congrats on the goodie bag 😂
Cuz he’s an influencer for the car brands now
That’s orange not yellow
Where did you purchase the rear wing ?
So badass that the Porsche tech watched your vids! Wow
Porsche is a two syllable word: Por-shuh, so they won't be able inspect it.  They don't deal with porsh cars.
For 15,000pound I am sure the engine and transmission alone would be good to put in another car.
Drivers cars, makes sense.
Why do u take videos out after time u need to take then out every 2to3 days
Do you call lifts ramps in the UK?? I'm all for bonnet and boot rather than hood and trunk, but in what upside down world is that a ramp
Plastic gears in a porsche. That is so cheap, even if it is for the window wipers. At least it was also cheap to replace.
So I’m curious what is the car valued at?
A Porsche dealer in the US would never do an inspection like this ,you would pay 3 hours of labor for a 20 year old that will tell you your brake thickness and tire tread .
First video i saw, I thought Mat was a bit douche bag-ish. But now he's my favorite youtuber. Im rooting for you Mat! Take care and don't wear yourself down
As a first time Porsche (981 Cayman S) owner as of 8 months ago, like you, I can attest to the dealership staff treating you like royalty, even in the US. Even if it's a second hand car that you didn't buy from their dealership like me. You drive into the bay, give your keys to the valet attendant, and the sliding glass doors automatically open up for you like you're walking on some sort of red carpet. They give you free Porsche merch at the store in the dealership. But then again, they charge you like royalty as well. I guess that's how they afford the $10,000 USD automatic coffee/espresso machine, massive TV's in the lounge, massive computer monitors on all the desks, etc. The owners in the lounge, however, are not nearly as down to earth in my experiences and can be quite stuck up.  Even after graduating from a automotive tech program, their mechanics have to go through at least 12 months of additional, Porsche specific education at Porsche's mechanic school. They have three levels: bronze, silver, and gold. Each level requires a certain level of experience at Porsche dealerships and passing numerous written and practical exams. Gold technicians have to have at least 5 years of experience
I'm in Australia and my Porsche dealership has always treated me really well and my first Porsche didn't even come from them. I always think it's an exceptional experience to go in there tbh and I'm way more trashier than you guys. The 718 looks great but you couldn't do any of this here. Once a car is wrecked, it's gone and can't be registered again.
respect for the guy at marketing to sell an oxygen sensor for 120 bucks...
YPU PAID TO MUCH
Great job Mat Hannah and the Team. this was a real achievement for you all being approved by a main dealer.
Who sold the seat belt tensioners 👀🤷‍♂️
Great vid, subscribed
no way mans looked at the glass and was like "yeah thats not Porsche glass"
post more ffs , i ve been following you siince 70k subss
💐
Really Great job, Keep up the great work, I Think you did an 8, and I had a Volvo s10  that was wrecked the same way. They brought it back to live and had to sell because they did a 6.
The tecs comment ‘every time it’s rehashed’, an a/c should never routinely need regassing,  if it does you have to look at why and correct the cause. Gas loss nearly always due to comp shaft seal ‘drying out’, regular use keeps it oiled from within and thus sealed. Best way to achieve this is to wire the a/c relay into reverse gear electrics, every time reverse is used the seal gets lubricated. Apparently Australian new cars do this and has resulted in over 95% reduction in gas usage from car sector.
Rebuilds a porsche but doesn't get the tint installed properly, my eyes.
Now you just need to pronounce the name correctly and you'll be a winner.
Did you know that people at Porsche were watching your build with interest? What an intimidating scenario.
Hearing him repeatedly say Porsh inside the Porsche dealership made me want to throw a brick through my TV.
Spacers for rear Matt
Need more content lol
I want a Cayman so bad it hurts
You couldn't drop one of those cars on lifts and roll them out of the way long enough to change that O2 sensor? You couldn't just lay down on a creeper and use the scissor lift it was on? Ok. Cool story bro. Guess you had absolutely no alternative except to take it somewhere else so you can plug your buddy's shop.
liked it ?? i LOVED IT.. wicked man..
Dude, good thinking on your part and a great job. I wish, I had your skills. I would definitely buy your car.
That car is smoking…
I enjoyed this a great deal. Thank you! I'm not mechanical at all but I recognize what hard work is. We've been rebuilding our personal saw mill here on our farm in Arkansas, US. Thanks again I'll add you for sure.
Great job 👍, fair play to porshe  doing check and letting u film etc👏👏, mechanic knew his stuff nice chap
It's amazing that even on this high end of a vehicle theres things that they cheap out on. Like I dont want any damn plastic components at all. Stuff like this highly motivates me with my 911 to make it what i want.
More lapel mic less shotgun mics. That way we can hear what everyone is saying regardless of where the camera is pointing.
Having learned how friendly Porsche can be to a 1M subscriber blogger, who apparently arrived with the preparation of the management (otherwise he would not have been able to make a video in there) I would also be curious to see how a similar situation would go for a zero subscriber simple human.
Great car and a very interesting video!
Maybe you should have repaired the engine before spending a million hours on the body.
Matt I need more updates lol
@ syllables Porsh-A
The amount of patience required for dealing with check engine lights on older European cars is ridiculous.  Nice job keeping a smile on the whole time.
Why don't you leave the wheel alignment until Porsche get the under tray for you and you can fit the new under tray and then get the 4 wheels alignment.
My dream porsche is the Panamera GTS, probably going to get slack for it, but I love my sedans and the Panamera GTS is just a beauty to me! I'm grinding my ass to get it as it's my final dream car!
Man I look forward to all your vids. This was a other great series.
Definitely get Josh on the channel again!
Lambda sensor is a typical VW/Porsche problem. My dad's stock Passat (automatic) had a lambda sensor problem like 10 times in 13 years. Also wishbone failure almost every year. And my dad is a pensioner who does not drive much and never fast/reckless. When we finally scrapped the car my dad wrote a letter to VW/Porsche listing all the issues the car had had and how much it all had cost him. VW/Porsche returned to him and I will never forget the first line of their response letter: "The amount of issues with your car is not normal, however goodwill is not possible."  Another very funny thing happened, when we complained that the Passat's automatic shifts too late. By ear alone it was clear that it was not shifting optimally. The dealer in Vienna had a specialist from Salzburg come, they put the car on the test stand and ran a couple of tests. Result "works as designed". No shit. Doesn't mean there isn't a design flaw :p  Also be wary with error codes. We had a Citroen C5 once. It would always bring up error "anomaly exhaust gas treatment". An independet technician later revealed to us, that they never managed to get the software done for the C5s in time for the release of the car, so about a thousand possible errors would terminate in a "anomaly exhaust gas treatment" output shown to you.
Hey Mat - just discovered you. Love your content and watched the Lambo project just now. May i ask if it is planned to put in a rollcage and fire suppression system? If not i think it would really be nice especially with such a crazy fast car. A big car guy in Germany (Philip Kaess) lost his build 1000hp Limo to engine fire - a fire suppression system would've probably saved most of the car.
Haha I love that the woman is like "the small details don't matter"  Really?! That's life!
You rebuild the entire car but fail to clean & restore under the bonnet?
Imagine doing this with Ferrari lmao.   They would invite you in and seat you at a table with 5 lawyers.
I started to restore an abarth in France, and Abarth just don't want to spent time looking at the car. There is some issue to fix, but they just refused to work on it even while being paid for.  The reason is that some of the wiring wasn't done properly, and because I had issues with brakes. It was well aware of that and was hoping to get some help from them.  Big shoutout to Porsche that took time for that.
Wow, first time checking this page out!  subscribed!  Brilliant!
It's PorschE with an E at the end!!! Goddamit Ma Armstro
First of all, you are a cool guy. I love to watch your videos…they are awesome. The Porsche is amazing, unbelievable what you have made. I love this car, I wish it was my own 😏 Looking forward to your next project 😉
7 out of 10! Top job in my book . Well done, 911 next challenge??
what was the overall cost of this repair
Between all of the European car brands I’ve owned, which is most of them.  Porsche was the best one on how they treat you.  It’s top notch.
Porsche is honestly the best car brand ever. I would love to have such a baby one day.
I know what's wrong with your car bruh, it doesn't have an engine under the hood, like srsl
Looks great, what was the total cost, or is that in another video.  The Signal Yellow looks great, well done.
Lol, swapping random but compatible parts. Great if it’s uprated. Not so great if not. Car history will unfortunately carry a lot of negative baggage about the car.
chances are the part number is the same. I work at auto manufacturing facility and we will have the same parts but only the first 4 numbers match the rest of the numbers are date and time codes so we can track and contain if needed
Errr..... Mat;  sticking on the wipers when they're frosted-up is a cowboy's tyre-kicking action.....
How much was the porsche at the auction and final price?
Gaahh. I KNEW you'd tell me the car was painted signal yellow. Every time I see a signal yellow car I get excited to know what shade of orange it is. It photographs so weirdly. I've ordered a car in Bahama Yellow, but the colour I really want is the shade of orange that signal yellow pretends it is when photographed. Fantastic job on that Cayman, by the way. Absolutely amazing project. Pity it's a PDK, mind.
Try to buy a wrecked gtr
That’s orange
Nice video, the enthusiasm, passion and perfectionism radiate from it. Really nice!
That dude was so nice and professional. nice video Mat
Porsche, not Porsch ! How many times...........
Love the rebuild looks mint. Always hate it when dealers pick up on non dear glass. Chances are that the OEM glass is made by the same company at the OE glass just without the Porsche logo on. It won’t make any difference in the way the glass is fitted.
THE NAME IS PORSCHE!!! NOT PORSCH! Why do you people always have to destroy names that are not in English...?
Honestly —- amazing job!!! As always. Now you fully build both of my favorite cars to be at least in reach somehow anytime — the RS5 and a Cayman 😮
What a great ad for Porsche and their people.
Ryan Gillmor - In my bloodline 👌
All nice and shiny until you see the underside.
Impressive work, now learn how to pronounce Porsche (hint, the e is not silent)
"Next episode I learn how to pronounce Porsche."
GJ on the rebuild.
Dear editor Please balance audio
Good stuff, it took me 2hour's to find the starter button on my first Mini, & over an hour & a half to get into my RX8 when the battery was flat, so you're not on your own. P.S. I still think you got reamed with the Lambo, my son just got one that's immaculate with half the miles that's had 2 very anal owners for £68,000, but you don't want one that needs no work, it would make for a very boring video. My beautiful wife has been watching you build this, which makes me nervous, she currently has a Mazda RX8 with a V6 that I built for me, on the up side I might be getting it back, on the down side my GT40 is going to have to wait, so thanks for that.
The part numbers are different so you can enter different retail pricing for each and mark up the Cayman one.  At least that's my theory.  Bet cost from the supplier to Porsche is the same.
Bet u were so glad u took it there and it wasn't as bad as u dreamt
Porsche is by far my favorite brand in the world and a visit like that is definitely part of that reason. Happy Cayman S and Cayenne Diesel owner here 🥰
Such a video would never be possible in Germany.
Nice video and well done on the Porsche rebuild recently found your channel and you have inspired me to start my own videos 🤣
These guys at the Main dealership are just parts swoppers
God Damm,  impressive!!!!!
I’d love to see Akira Nakai put a WB kit on one of these. I wonder if he’s done his tuner work on anything other than your basic 911 chassis
Pretty  nice work on that, well done!
This car is like a girl with a lot of make up lol next day in the morning you find out is trash .
Well done Matt.
really hat with it?
How much did it the howl car cost? 15000+ repair I would say 100.000k
Is anyone else bothered by his pronunciation of Porsche? Just me?
18:28 Now that you're Porsche person, it's time you learn to pronounce it correctly. In German, the 'e' at the end of a word (or name in this case) is pronounced like an English 'a': Porsche. Poor-sha
I remember watched your TT video long time ago and that was probably it and now i came across u again :D bloody awesome now im hooked great videos
Hi, I love your videos, please pronounce Porsche correctly ! There are videos how is it right pronounced  - all my best wishes from Germany  - Robert
I've worked at a couple of different Motor factors over the last 15years and when I was a parts sales man at Euro Car Parts I specialised in BMW and Porsche parts, for some strange reason sometimes part numbers will supercede other numbers even though its the same piece. Sometimes if a parts manufacturer changes the part ends up being given a new part number
You got the special treatment of a Youtuber with a big reach (Almost 1M subs).
Absolutely love your channel anymore cars coming soon my favourite was the RS5 you have proven yourself well done keep the cars coming 👍
Dats orange
finally you start use proper diagnostics pal
Can't believe it would have a plastic cog 😅
Ramp. He keeps using that word. I don't think that word means what he thinks it means.
i want to hear this man say water bottle
Hannah hit it on the nose. They all look the same. As a former Porsche owner, I decided to move onto Ferrari and Aston. Porsche’s are fine cars but I don’t find them special.
Love Autel scanners! 90% as good as the expensive Snap-On’s at 1/4 to 1/10th the price.
Love the car but please fix the Porsche badge in the front
Car vertical is reading only GB england number plate righ? or eny car with eny nummber plate?
I have found the same with mercedes, they have 5+ different part numbers for the same part, so they can charge different prices depending on if you have a cheap car or an expensive one.
Would make a great track day car.
That is some car and it's good to see  it restored instead of scrapped.
Terrible repair. I’ll never drive a DIY repaired car like this. It could kill the driver and the passengers
that's not signal yellow
Been waiting for this, cars with personal touch, better than standard rebuilds.
What is a mo oar??
Given what happened to this vehicle, you did a hell'uva job IMHO!  As an military aircraft mechanic I'm well aware of the effort you put in to get the car back to where it was.  It'll NEVER be perfect again, anyone can get so detailed/perfectionistic to see that, but it's not damn far off.  Bottom line, WELL DONE!
I love the instrument cluster looks so sporty
I don't like the black space between the bumper and hood... it looks like a really fucked up body gap
“Porsche” as “Porsh,” that is incorrect. The correct way to pronounce “Porsche” is actually as a two-syllable word: “Por-shuh.”
Ya no one is going to take responsibility and tell you how to repair the structural integrity of a car.
great video
Man that's so nice looking... good job.
e is not silent, it's Porsche, P o r s c h E... curguy should know
cool video i liked it
What a beast you are Matt
Signal yellow? More like traffic cone orange
It almost looks like it was on one those car mover trailers and the car above it landed on it. Just my guess
You and Luan Olivera have a similar style lol 🔥
Why do so many of you people insist on pronouncing the brand name Porsche wrong? It's a person's name. Show some respect to the heritage and learn to say the name properly. Better yet, correct your friends and fans in how to pronounce this German man's name properly.  Porsh Uh.
First time I came across your channel.  I like muscle cars but your video was very good explaining your car and the dealership was 10/10 in helping you.  Great Video.  🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
By luck i found this again, i subbed when you got this car but have missed all the videos! Just resubbed
It really shouldn’t matter whether you’re going to a Kia dealership or a Porsche one, you’re still a customer and I think this dealership ticked all the boxes whilst upholding the brand. Plus of course it’s good PR to be on a YT channel with such a good following. Car looks awesome! 👍
New sub today, after this popped up on my feed. Watched your "introduction" video, and then went to binge-watch the whole Cayman playlist. Love your attitude, and production. Can't help but wonder where I'd be now, if YouTube had been around in my early days of building up "rally spec" Escorts and hot Westfield kit-cars in the late '80s. We were all hands-on, self-taught, and had we had the resources to "video" it all and put it online back then, I think we'd be in a similar position these days.
Hey Mat, what's going on with your BMW E24 635CSI? I love this Projekt
Well done porch
Mate, you’ve got nearly as many subs as the entire brand. Never assume you should r be there. Hell they should be throwing long-termers at you.
'Motor' pronounced... Mouaa 😄😄 British english is fire 🔥🔥
'its for gentlemen' say's the man witha  bright yellow one,,,, lol
Who are Porsh? I thought the car was a Porsche.
PorschE. The "E" is hearable! Learn from the PorschE guy! Porsch* hurts my german eyes. ;-)
You did a much better job than Tesla. The gaps are enough to store money on each tesla i have seen on the road 😂
The waffle house has found its new host
where did u buy the GT4RS swan neck wing? thank you
Lucky 😅 if I had those skills I’d be rebuilding all my cars for myself.
How much did he spend total?
Well done Porsche .. makes me want to come and visit you myself
Good on them. Great attitude from the staff 👏
Well done Matt!.👍
PORSCHE UK ARE AWESOME !!  I wonder if they’re like that in Australia?  Anyone?…
Do it with the BMW M5 too see what they think about it once it’s done.
Your patience is amazing. Just watching you change the seatbelts around and that made my respect for you double 😆 some efforts you go to mate. Credit to you and would love for you to do some work for me
How much did he pay for the car does anyone know ?
Beautifully done! I only wish I didn't get triggered so much when I hear people mispronounce Porsche as "porsh" instead of "porsh-eh" like it should be.
Did a better job than goonsquad did with theirs...
Congratulations on a fantastic restoration, and to Porsche for being such terrific sports!  😀
Good job on the porky mate looks really nice in that colour 👍
The car is gorgeous. I was meh about the colour and wing when he was doing the work but it's really come together well and I've changed my opinion now.
When you start your videos office, so many commercials, cause you monetize it hard a lot of people leave and don’t give me a thumbs up. Just a heads up.
There is one big thing that nobody noticed. The steering wheel is on the wrong side. Lol
19:24 Voi che sapete, Mozart. Great choice!
A friend had a vw jetta and his wiper motor was made of plastic too. I figured just cheap since it was a vw but I guess we were wrong lol. VW dealership wanted like $500 to fix it but we went to a U-pull-It and got it for pennies.
Very cool that your tech said he watched the previous videos on the car, so he already knew what it was all about.
Awesome video man. Love Porsche’s!
Wow. Lots of work very impressive looks amazing 👍
The Cayman is going where?! Porsch?!
There are other hand gestures and facial expressions u can put on a thumbnail, just saying
The Bosch part numbers are different because they constantly change part numbers!
I am contemplating wat's more important, me not hearing Porsche being pronounced wrong or me watching the video
Where do you to buy wrecked cars. Mmmmm
Would have been better if the inspector knew nothing about the car.
looks like a nice experience almost want to consider have a look at the nearest dealership
I worked at Porsche myself, it's a policy to treat all clients the same. They want it to feel like you are at home at their dealership with no worries at all. It looks awesome compared to what it looked like. Nice 😁😁😁😁
I once got into an Porsche dealer with my worker outfit on, inwas treated very very well ! Glue was hanging in my hair 😅 so i bought my cayenne ( second hand ) there 👌🏻👍🏻
3:42 hehe,  poo30
im from germany, can somebody pls explain what a porsch is?
the badge on the front bonnet is way out of line. Looks horrific mate if I’m honest like it’s been thrown together in Birmingham.
Dude it’s porsche not porsch
I love the enthousiasm from the Porsche dealer and their staff. Very nice that they allowed you to film it all
wait, 15000 euro for a wrecked Cayman? No Way...
LOL haven’t seen a youtube sponsor / ad that was so apt and informative.
❤
Your smile at the end says it all
I just don't understand why you waste all that time and money on a car that you are never gonna be able to sell as it's got all those write-off markers on it?  Do you ship them to Dubai or somewhere bent like that?
love from zimbabwe ,you videos are my daily food.
Bro... adds getting crazy
Yo u related to Benjamin Armstrong aka. Bitboy crypto😂😂
Dude found out you can fix salvage cars and got famous off of it whereas Slavs here in Sacramento, CA been doing this for the last 25 years
Hi Mat, I love how clean and shiny your cars always look, do you use the Mat Armstrong detailing products or something else? I’d love to see a video of how you keep your cars so pristine and shiny! Cheers 👍🏻
Really impressive work, but theres a 0% chance I'm risking my life in that thing.  If it ever gets in an accident again, who knows how badly it's going to come apart
Please Mat, just pleeeeeease... PorschE, do not and i repeat. Do not forget the E at the end. Kind of like "Porsch-uh".
He can’t even pronounce the name of the auto correctly😞
A little tip…  Air con should never need a “regas”  if it needs a “regas” where has the old refrigerant gone??  Odvs in your case we know where the refrigerant has gone
You have every right to be there 👍
Mat, did you buy the Ferrari 458?
Crazy because of this was a Tesla rebuild!!   Elon would have had you shot before you’d have made it to the factory 🤣🤣
I think this illustrates how businesses realise how important youtube is moving forward in helping their brand
Lamba sensors are not a thing, Lambda is though
The vacuum line would effect the coolant/overheating issues because the water pump has a sleeve around the turbine of the water pump, which is vacuum controlled. This stops flow of coolant on warm up to warm the engine faster
Delightful background opera violin concerto - Aida?...🎻
Good work on that build, wish I knew half of what you know.  Just out of curiosity where did you get those wheels from and the carbon air intake ducts.  I have a 718 GT4 that would look great with those mods
I've been obsessed with Porsche and Corvettes my whole life. I'm writing a book currently while working a 9-5 and I will own both of those cars. Great video.
😎👌
Where can I get a GT4 body kit? Would love to add one to my 718 Cayman S.
that's the thing about Porsche, they understand the cars are a luxury item and its the experience and excitement about the brand no matter how you come into ownership that keeps customers coming back.  The Cayman is an epic car that will go down in history but for Porsche its a gateway drug to the next faster more expensive model so no matter if you rock up in an accident repaired Cayman or a gt2RS your going to get treated well, they want you to feel special just like the car is special and keep coming back for more.  I will say the only difference in experience at the Porsche dealer is between an suv and the sports cars,  if you rock up in a sports car they know your really a car guy and they step it up a notch.  They never say it but  everyone fully understand the suv market is propping up the sports cars they love to make, so its still a great experience going in with an suv but you can tell the guys int he dealership are more into the sports cars which i personally like to see.
If it's one thing that VAG Dealerships have down it's customer service. When my Polo was in for service, I walked around the Audi Showroom and everyone treated me like I could afford the cars there, meanwhile the MacBook I'm writing this from is worth more than my actual car. And even when I walked into Porsche on the other side of the street, everyone was super welcoming! Porsche really is just the greates and classiest brand ever!
Loved it. You made me a fan of the Cayman S.
Great video. Just one point - if you've now become a Porsche guy, then you really should start pronounceing the name correctly with both its syllables. 😏
Why not 3d print the weel
Well done matt , another  one looked over !!  The Aston first & now the porsche  ,  But  still no pull up on NO  front reg plate  ??? . Why ??? . But it's just makes the car legal .... it must have one !! .
This guy is a legend man. So inspiring and motivational seeing this guy work. Most youngsters should aspire to be like this guy hands on and skilled. Not one of these office sitting clowns pressing a few keyboard buttons. Would love to meet this guy and work with him.
Looks like a GT4. Install the bucket seats
Matt can you rebuild my 2010 911? Its still driving but I managed to partly destroy the Drivers Site (mirror, door and plenty of Side Panels) while going around a corner. I ll even pay you for it, as long as its cheaper than the 12-15k estimate I got from my local Car Workshop
Can you not get a special test done to reverse the categorised history? Saw Salvage rebuilds uk do it on a car recently on a Cat C car? You have to put it back to manufacturer finish as per year with wear and tear taken into consideration. Be interesting to see if it can be done to the Porsche?
How I sound if my mom ask me to watch her engine oil level
“weird tension” wears a mercedes hoodie 10:11
british ChrisFix!
Carvertical is not trustworthy tho :/
Carvertical don’t work tho
How much british accent do you want to have? "Moa" instead of "Motor"
Hi Matt,  I noticed that you have a diognistich tablet.  May I ask witch brand or type your using? I’m interested.  Keep up with the great videos. It’s inspiration
Nicely placed ad 😂
I saw you there when I was looking at GT3 lol
I did exactly the same thing with my wipers just yesterday 🤣
They’re bound to be nice you’re giving them free advertising
Why would you expect them to treat you any diffent than a millionaire? your a customer paying the same money ....ive never had a bad experince with main dealers ..maybe a snotty sales perosn who thinks their god but there just funny to watch. great content Matt
Been following this. Great feedback from Porsche Solihull. They seem like a great dealership.
That’s cool the mechanic has watched your vids on the car
Whats the song on the end of your videos?
ngl I was triggered every time Porsche was said wrong.
Great Success!
Lol if you took it to them they would of said oh that’s 10k
Great Channel, terrible Beard.
Literally live around the corner from this dealer!
CC on...
I'm with Hannah on this......................911 (991 etc) are all very similar and the minute details are great - they really don't change much. And I'm a Porsche guy!
Funniest thing about genuine windscreens is they’re made in the same factory. Only difference is the Porsche label 😂
And I want it
Orange pal
Great video - Nice work on the car! I agree with Hannah though! Lmfao! 18:08
I went to Dick Lovett in Bristol in a Z4, e85, I walked in and told the guy I was going to be honest, I couldn't afford anything in there, but would he mind if I looked? He treated me like a customer. I will always rember that and if i win the lottery, I'll buy my turbo s from there.
You bought the Porsche with the cheapest price at the auction, but the repair cost must be insanely crazy, innit? Look at the state of that car before the transformation. They're cursed.
I know this makes me sound like a class A gatekeeper, but as a German who loves and works for Porsche, it just makes me cringe everytime someone says "Porsch" without the "e". Can't complain though, we Germans butcher our fair share of English brand names. Actually, most people here do just the same thing to Nike. Anyway, great content and love to see how you got that wreck back to a decent state where it's basically in a better than many cars you'd find on the road. And I also love to see when people start seing and appreciating what Porsche is about. Maybe you ARE a gentleman!
I would love to hear the word "Porsche" just pronounced correctly instead of just something terrible like "Porsh" ... it is in fact like "PorshE"! ...
Good work!  I owned a rebuilt 2005 Lotus Elise that had been absolutely destroyed in the rear left quarter but it was rebuilt and accumulated an extra 35k miles since the accident.  It's with its new owner now and never had any mechanical issues that weren't simply caused by old Lotus stuff.  It was a great buy!
Stop yanking on the undertray and ripping it!!! Undo the fastners for f$*ks sake :-). Just kidding, love your work!
Josh was great and he admitted watching your videos 👍🏻🙂🙋🏼‍♂️
I was really confused when you said that the wipers are broken because you turned them on frost window. I am doing this regularly on my 20 year old Renault and nothing ever went wrong but yeah I got it, it’s plastic on Porsche
Ads take the p in this one,stopped watching 3/4 way through 🙁
Great video!! You did some godly work to that bad boy.
Lambda lamb-da not Lamba 🤦🏼‍♂️
Matt you guys are Awesome,  Hope you have something CRAZY planned for 1 Million Subs!!?? 🥰🥰🥰 Hurry, she's coming Quuuuick!!
very cool, love it, another big smiler video. love the journey
Porsche looks amazing in that colour & great choice of alloys, can't believe tech only gave it 7/10 after the total transformation from scrap car to something would love to park on my drive, well done yet again mat, from repairing hannah's tt in a carpark 3 years ago to where you are now think even Alan Sugar would be impressed!! Long may you continue Sir Mat.
Srs module reset will get rid of the airbag light
Was hoping to hear some "bidi bodi bidi boo" in the background in the Porsche dealership!!!!!! Good work as usual tho Mat!!! And Josh was deffo a fan of the channel!!👍
Ma man risked it all  But question, all that work on the panels does not affect the aerodynamics or stability? Forgive my ignorance
Only real reason my mum keeps a suv is cos there’s no other garages like em, down to the small things
btw the sensor is called lambda and you say the d
When your teacher inspects your assignment
I love Porsche.Impressive
Hopefully this will not be your last Porsche, I also fell in love with Porsche after I bought the 718 Boxster even though I didn't like so much Porsche before
Well done, great job Mat & Hannah, that’s awesome 🎉
It doesn’t matter what you’re fixing, I always seem to have a gormless smile on my face whilst watching. The positivity is infectious.
Wearing a "make the v8 great again" hoodie to Porsche is comedy. Awesome experience though, Josh is great!
why the suspenseful music? lol also, that is a lift not a ramp. It lifts the car...
Lamb-da
I can confirm that feeling when walking into a Porsche dealership. I don’t look like the stereotypical client, but always got treated with respect. Can’t say the same about Toyota and Honda for example. 😐
Better late than never!
Good job
You r amazing u knew everything in Porsche the lamb sensor
The colours on your Porsche and those at the dealership are DELICIOUS
Porsche knows that even a person in comfy clothes could have loads of money to spend on them. Treat everyone even.
LambDA, lambDA!!! 😂😂
everybody want a Porsche
You just have to learn how to pronounce Porsche and then you'll be all set.
Whaaaa that digital moonroof at the end 🤯
Stunning cars. Good job on this!
poRschEEEEE
Enjoyed that mat
Amazing work ♥️♥️ respect from Sweden 💪💪
I think the Tech guy cheated... he watched the videos.. lol.. all good. means you are doing good if they watch.
Good work my friend. I'm thinking GT3 or Turbo S - decisions decisions......
Did somebody crash it into a lake? Why does the undercarriage look so dirty lol.
10:15 that lady is gorgeous.
Must have been like a school kid on the parent / teacher evening.  Bricking it, in case you got a bad report 😂. The car isn’t perfect, but considering it was rebuilt by someone who is a skilled amateur, with limited info from Porsche, it’s a pretty damn good result mate 😊
Signal Yellow? I’d call that Orange.
Always clear frosting windows on a morning with hand warm water ok then do you blades clear the screen bang sorted for a good freezing morning until you are warmed up the car ok matt remember hand warm water for no cracks sorted ,no need for antifreeze spray nowt else listen it's the best tip you could ever have heard saves everything sorted Leigh Bowman
Stunning video. Especially the attitude of everyone including yourself
So what was is the bag at the end Mat?. This is what everyone wants to know 😂
Success.
I'm amazed you should feel any imposter syndrome - lovely car - great channel
Awesome !
This video is so good, fair play to  Porsche and the engineer, but I'd hate to take my 2000 Boxster to them
A definitely think you should do a daily video a just can’t get enough of them come on mat sort it out 🏎️💨
„Porsch“😂😂😂. „Porsche“amk
Great video, loved whole series so far. Interestingly always found Porsche treat you well no matter who you are - I heard it said that they value the current and potential future customer 😉
you call this yellow?
this was so amazing - i’m happy you enjoyed your experience with the dealership
Look at me learned bri’ish; Wai-pah Mou-ah
They are always good at Solihull.
Josh real mvp
Nice work.  The vacuum line leak won't cause overheating.  He meant the cabin heat wouldn't work properly because of the damper door actuators.
It's not a Porsch. There's an E for a reason.
Matt is a top bloke.
PorschE not Porsch
Amazing work. Keep it up!
You do realise it’s an offence to drive a vehicle without a front number plate right ?
Car looks much better from the outside. I was surprised how rough the engine and underneath was
WOULD HE PUT IT IN THE SHOW  ROOM FOR SALE
This guy gives out Daniel Ricciardo vibe.
Best colour ever!!!!!!!
Just tried your code don’t work
Props to Josh for his knowledge and pragmatic answers - he raised my impression of Porsche and represents the brand well
you know it's sunday when a new mat armstrong vid drops :D
great build
Nice Girls at Porsche think i am gone get me a Porsche
The effort you’ve put in to rescuing that car gives you more right to be in a main dealership than most. Great effort.
Smoothest transition to an ad read i have seen you do in a while Mat. Good on ya
Porsche pronounced as in Portia!
Good to see how they treated you, I have a 83 Mondial and when I go to Ferrari, I’m always stressed and not very welcomed. I love their cars but not the vibe, Porsche seems to get that right.
You can enter any dealership with confidence because you've earned the right to do so.
Its not called Porsch. Its called Porsche. The "E" is not for decoration.. xD
Make more video on bmws ❤
First time coming across your channel Mat, great video. You did a phenomenal job with this car, a 10 in my book.
pretensioners are a part of the buckle.  Other end dude
I love that you still want the Porsche to a 10 rather than a 7 - given where it came from 👍
Next time give the guy speaking a mic can't hear anything he's saying sad face emotion 😕
The proplem with damage list cars they lose so much value. No one will tuch them, dealers ect.
My parents get our porsche suv fixed.
Been to Mercedes Taunton dealership, they tried to sell a car (C class coupe 40k) to us as 2 owners and had 4, bought a different car from them and they sold that car in a poor state and now they don't want to fix the problems it has only after 1 month later... avoid Taunton Mercedes Dealership, while we waited there others were having the same problems...
I don't know what they did for cold weather testing but my 718 is shocking, windows frozen solid, cant even get in the car and the washers and wipers are totally redundant as they are unheated and no chance of defrosting with the engine in the rear. WTF Porcshe......
Yellow??
Great colour choice!
B E A Utiful that car is, you've done a cracking job on getting it back to its best.
Will Porsche GB take this car as a trade-in and sell the car from the forecourt?  I doubt it, I believe this car will only be an orphan. I would not wish to drive such a car with such a history
I hope you asked them for the old vents they took off they worth money discontinued part
Well done my brother. You deserve all this success.  Thank you. 👍
Nice one Mat
Congrats Mat :-) Good work!
Porsche dealers are actually amazing. Like you say, Mat - you might expect them to be aloof… but you get incredible attention to detail and a warm and welcoming service every time. It’s a better brand for customer service than many I’ve owned!
What a complete shambles of a repair lol
Some car that Mat, cracking job
I guess the customer service tends to improve when you’re a YouTuber with nearly 1,000,000 subs who’s going to show the audience what your first Porsche dealership experience is like!
Yes Mat ,do you have knowledge on a golf 5 GTI?
That’s a right result Mat, fully expected of course👌🏼 love this one looks mint.
Owning a Porsche would my absolute dream. Beautiful cars and this video makes me want to go to my local Porsche dealership
your a legend matt
So happy you are getting the praise you deserve!
Hi greetings from Thailand fair play to you taking this on and winning well done keep it up
Positive vibes, as always
It's the 18:20 mark for me!
Porsche has Always been My all time favorite car. Love the vids on this one
Why Porsche Solihull? Isn't that a bit far?
waiting more new videos Matt more power and continue on doing more projects 💪
Impressive work, but please, pronounce Porsche correctly! The tech said it right
Mat, for future reference, get a team of people to record you and process videos for you, I usually get bored of watching videos but when I see a new one from you I click on it straight away and watch it all, I really enjoy your content and I feel like you need to turn it into something more frequent because it hardly happens to me to be consistent with stuff on here but your content is quality and nicely done, you have that eye for detail and you know exactly what and how to deliver, keep it up, 100% you will soon go to the top ! Keep it up buddy 👍🏼
Am i the only one that has a smile on their face throughout Mat’s videos?
I'm surprised Josh never mentioned the MISSING FRONT REG PLATE. As it is a Legal requirement 😳👎
You should never put yourself down! I never bother to dress up when I go into a showroom like that. My money is as good as everyone else's.
Love it ❤
Nearly at the big 1 million!!!
Man...great work !
Respect to wheelmania with the alloys
How did you book the free service?
Pay a hundred odd grand for a car with plastic on any gearing parts. So much for German engineering.🤷‍♂️
Love your channel and your energy. The Porsche tech made a great point about wearing eye protection. I know it may not be the best while filming but from experience I can tell you it’s a lifesaver. Please wear eye protection so you can keep fixing cars and living your dreams and not get hurt. Best to you and wish I was in the UK to have a chance to meet you. Maybe you can tour the US one day 👍
I’ve become addicted your channel; always engaging and entertaining. Keep the great content coming….
I'm team Hannah, they do all look the same.
Good people at Porsche Solihull. I used to take my Volvo C30 there for MOTs because it was one of the only places it could get onto the MOT ramps with air suspension.
Amazing video Mat ! I'm pretty often doing kinda the same as you, buying totaled or flooded cars around and try to win the challenge to completely rebuilt them and do the right work at the right price on it! (thanks breakers , internet, used parts :D) I'm from Switzerland and i really enjoy the passion you're showing in your work and your videos!! amazing!
Why do i imagine all these guys staring at this motor and pulling themselves off !! Ffs  beavis and buthead channel
Awesome Mat. Well done mate
Me and My cousin were BMW guys for years and years. My cousin got a Porsche 718 Cayman S loves it... and the cars definitely converted me too. Theres something about Porches... they really are a drivers car just like the beemers
When the technician explains the grill callback situatikon and Mats like "ohhhhhh riiiiiiiiiiiight" almost as if hes thinking... "mate you realise I just rebuilt this entire car back from a wreck heap right?"😅
I was servicing the lifts on site when you were here, car looked unreal in the flesh!
That was probably the best video I've ever watched about rebuilds so professional and they where such sports at the dealership what a classy bunch it was a genuine welcome and interest from them  Looking forward to the wheel alignment video   Regards  Haley
Porsche 🎉 with e - zefix! Hey, 12:43 the employee knows the name of his company ❤ 18:07 Mat is willing to learn. 😅
You know what 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
What’s the roof thing at the end ??
Porsche is the only way to go. Unbelievable cars. Can drive them everyday and they are built to last.
But..... what was in the bag, Mat? 🧐
I beg you rebuild a mk 4 supra
Safety important trouble with salvage the cars ñever the same after wards but gd videos
Interesting to see how you get on with 'The Airbag Team' who did your belt tensioners. In my experience I found them to be a bunch of scammers!
liking the house mat!👍
I absolutely love the choice to go signal yellow on this beautiful automobile.   Chef’s kiss!
@Mat Armstrong Nice job Mat, great effort, those Official Gauges are so important, many car repairs don’t use the proper ones and that’s the difference between getting a factory repair or getting a repair that many of us don’t expect or even want.  I know what you mean about being in a car that you feel your not supposed to be in, but if you had the money or someone gave the car, your still the same person......!! When I started delivering all different types of cars,  around the country that’s when my mind really changed and so I bought a  B.M.W.  before people like me were driving them. A car is a tool you use to get a job done, you just get in it and drive it, like the rest...!🧐😎
Nice colour
So I have been mispronouncing "Porsche"?
You were literally 1 minute from my house. Could have dropped in for a cuppa 😂
Suppose that motor would be rejected at the factory final inspection?
Mat!!! Love your videos, you make it look so easy.. Sending  you love and respect from the states (El Paso, Texas)..
Know what you mean about main dealers treating you like a speck of dirt and I’m so pleased you had good service from yours.   I visited my local Porsche dealer about 10years ago. The sales team made a subjective judgement and wouldn't even allow me to sit in one of their precious cars and at one time asked me to stop touching the car (buying signal?). I was dressed in my off hours tee and jeans and I was about 40 years old at the time. I was up for buying a 911 from them for cash which again they made it obvious they did not believe.  Shrugging, I eventually left the showroom and then slowly drove back past the entrance tooting the horn of my Ferrari. I gave the sales guy a thumbs up as I drove off, honest it was a thumb.
Where’s the C63 up to ? Miss seeing that car.
Can you buy a Toyota supra and rebuild it 😁, supra Mt favorite 😍
I agree with Hannah all porsche's are the same 😆
Why don't you ever say what it cost to buy and how much the repairs cost  ,that would be educational
Nice job Mat. Well done 👍🏼
The guys at porsche seem like really nice guys. Not stuck up
I’ve one Matt can’t wait to drive this car when I win it, see you on the road!!
Nice 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
a waipah mo ah!   Lavv ya Mat❤
How’s your chance the guy that is inspecting the car has been watching the videos of you building it, like wtf you can’t make this up 😂
First of all Mat, how could they not like you two? You two are the kindest people. I used to work at Porsche in West Palm Beach Florida and fell in love with the 911. Such beautiful machines!  I felt like I was out of place many times and I worked there but its awesome to see the staff so friendly there as well. Look forward to future updates with this car.
josh was truly professional
Thx Mat, enjoyed that. Newly subscribed. Love that T shirt. Don't know where you get your energy from. Brilliant stuff, keep it going. As a 1998 boxster owner (which I've had from new) I can vouch Porsche are very good at keeping the same parts across their models but giving them different numbers.
i wonder if he went there on his own, with no cameras and if was a not known youtuber. Would their treatment be the same ???  i have my guesses!
I watch your videos with awe because I barely trust myself to do an oil change on a Honda Jazz 😆
Where is Hannah’s jacket from???
well done Porsche, could easily have sent you on your way with a "non approved" repair to one of their cars. You went in for an inspection and service work and looks like you were treated as if you were buying a new car. Josh seems a top bloke, watched your journey with the car probably learnt a lot as thats not the sort of thing he probably gets to see
Almost a MILLION 🎉
They won't tell you how to repair stuff yourself but once you've done it they will tell you? 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤣
Watching a Mat video is always refreshing
I’m impressed with your work on the car and the Porsche staff. I’m still keeping my 97 Ford F150 4x4 though! Lol
Mat you will reach 1M by the end of this week, you have made everyone's day just by posting these amazing video, watching from ZA.
No blues Monday here thanks mat mate awesome video 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
1 million followers loading....... .
Let's start by with a important thing.  It is a Porsche and not a Porsch.  So now that is fixed
Bro you are the fucking man!
"extremely well considering.." "a seven out of ten" oh man... hahah
Great video and a lovely car .
After seeing nothing but the man who sold out his family in the SPARE book online, it's refreshing to see a wholesome character like Mat to cheer up our day! Thanks Pal!
Been watching you for a while and then i realized, you must not be too far from me after i seen you at Wheelmania on Cov rd and also now Porsche in Shirley. Love your vids, learnt a few things myself watching! Keep it goingggg 😁
Ah see… @13:07 He let it slip! He’s a viewer! He knew exactly what too point out off the bat! 😂… Don’t take it too harshly Mat.  You can see the guy Respects you for the work you did! …You earned your stripes!
Porsche chick was hot!
I just love the colour of that Cayman porsche...!
Genuinely can’t wait for a 911 build one day really enjoyed this build. When is any of the cars going up for raffle?
Hi Mat, I've messaged you on Insta could you have a look if you have a min please, love the vids keep it up!!
First time watching his videos and got nothing but feel good vibes 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽 subscribing right now
Still looks sooo good!!!
Funfact, the vacuum test of an AC system also helps to pull out any moisture that shouldn't be inn there.
love the videos
I have a 987.2, I got the same belt tensioner code like 4 years ago. I replaced the full seatbelt and still nothing. One of the connectors was missing a connection from the wire harness. Porsche wanted 2.5k for a whole new harness. I found the connector of a 996 and spliced the wires. This made the code go away for a month! Then it came back lol. I give up and have learned to live with the cheeky little red light.
You have totally earned the right to step into ANY dealership and hold your head up high. It is they who would be honored to have you at this point!
Its a beautiful car. You've save it from the wreck that it was.
There’s definitely worse problems to have though, ha ha ha ha what a treat. You simply can’t help love this bloke
Nearly at 1 mil let’s go
🔥🔥
I’ve never liked this Porsche but mat this is definitely changing my mind about them
I've never felt like I didn't belong in a porsche dealers matt , I use porsche Wolverhampton and have the same experience you did. I've taken in a £1200 boxster ebay wreck dressed dirty overalls  and was treated like I had taken in a 100k 911.
Josh is an absolutely professional guy! Very nice to see Porsche green light this type of content and work with Mat. Cool video!
Cool video Mat! New subscriber here, looking forward to your other videos too! have a nice day
I'm a huge Porsche fan, the most beautifull cars there are. Yours is absolutely STUNNING! Great job!
My new favourite channel !
Man I love all your vids..they truly pump me up and make my day so much better..thanks 🫡
We used Car Vertical when we went to purchase our car a month ago, your code and recommendation were perfect Thankyou.
I love my boxster 👍
8:11 awesome build but PLEASE center the badge
Love the car/this build but that yellow seat belt not matching the yellow exterior is driving my OCD craaaazy.   Lol
"driving, permitted" yeah thanks, was going to do that anyways
Lambda pronounced LAM-DA, to walk into a Porsche MD and submit a car for inspection that you did that much work on without structural knowledge and it get a 7/10 for basically fairly minor stuff in the scheme of things is truely remarkable and a testament to your skill, this is a fantastic video. And The dealers did themselves no harm at all in the way you were treated, after all its one of their motors and a moving advertisement.
Top job on the bits you see, needs the underside putting right and then bravo - it was a brave buy that had you not got a million subs fan base would have been a poor call.  Its a win all round.
Kudos to Porsche Sollihul, they've just literally onboarded multiple previously non-Porsche lovers into the brand! They are awesome Porsche brand ambassadors, well done! This build has drawn me into the brand too, and seeing how Mat was treated by the main dealership is awesome, they obviously care about their cars, but ultimately love cars & want everyone to enjoy them too! You must be be really happy with the results Mat. I can't believe how inexpensive that floor pan was, imagine if it was for a Lamborghini!
So now that it’s been inspected, you can sell it? Here in the states once a vehicle gets tagged with a salvage title it’s hard to register it and get insurance
Hi matt how much was that Autel and where do you get it from?
Hi matt how much was that Autel and where do you get it from?
Waheeeeey, big up Solihull
Matt what colour is ur paint on the Porsche. ? If by chance can you please give me a colour code
Intro: today is gonna be epi….  wait… wrong channel.
My first comment on your Channel Mat. Loving the content, great guys at Porsche aswell. Down to earth. Look forward to your next upload mate.
Mat, I can't lie, it's been a while since I sat and watched one of your videos...this content has evolved bloody brilliantly.
Hey Mat, nice videos. But ONE thing. Since Porsche is a german car, and i am from germany, let me short tell you, that "Porsch" is wrong! It is Porsche [ˈpɔʁʃə]. The e is not silent!
I recently had my Cayman S into a Porsche Centre and its now a write off after it caught fire coming out after a full health check. Not all Porsche centres are equal. You got good treatment because of your huge reach. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I'd rate them as poor.
Great work as usual
dude! awesome work! i should bring my nissan to you to fix
Hi mat!!! Mat memang padu 🇲🇾
What an experience for you ! Rebuilding a write off Porsche & then taking it back into Porsche for their opinion / work on the car. How helpful was Josh as well - Quite clearly a superb employee of Porsche Solihull.
just wish you Brits would use 2 syllables for Porsche (por-sha)
really enjoyed the educational part on the lambda sensor, please do more stuff like that! was more informative that normal!
ive akways had a great service from porsche compared to audi and bmw
roll on a million, mat!
How can you put it on the road if N means it can never go back on the road, only scrapped or used for parts ?
Here in canada we learnat birth to make sure your wipers are off when you turn off the car so that this doesn't happen when you start the car latter
dang surprised they would inspect a write off car
Hell yeah man, 1mil subs soon!
Lol that is mental I love 1 min away from that Porsche dealer 😲.
To my surprise it was all plastic???  Whahahahahaha 2:40   How long have you noy been in am enginebay??
Signal yellow.......Same color as yourself....Tan-signal yellow....
Excellent end to another superb build! You are a true inspiration, your attitude,capability and demeanour are so compelling to watch. You even didn’t trigger my pet hate with the pronunciation which, as Josh used is Por-sher not Porsh. Colour looked awesome. You are so much more talented than you give yourself credit for- and a great human being as well!
The good thing at least you now know how to put everything right for new owner & a education for future cars👊😎👍
Wanneer ga je de BMW 5 weer afmaken benieuwd hoe het eruit komt te zien
No front number plate ?
Here in finland Porsche is very friendly to those who mobify their cars. They once had a highly mobified cayenne (by @ronicollin) in their showroom. I think every car manufacturer should allow their cars to be mobified!
Mat I can't tell how much you run my day bro you are a great difference in my life the way u rebuild cars back I'm impressed thank u
I want to go to the Porshe showroom now and drool
like a boss my G
one of the Best channel on YouTube
Off course they will treat you well. You’re the most humble down to earth YouTuber! Love seeing your struggles and successes! Never stop the narrations, they’re awesome! ☀️☀️☀️
Both Porsche and you did a very good job! Great to see it.  The brand Porsche earned more respect from me.
ban evil 5 times loudspeakers now , i am fed up of this evil people's
Nice to see the dealers being friendly and helpful. My local BMW dealer make me feel like a criminal when I take my 135 in for anything
Hi Matt what Autel diagnostic are you using ? Thanks Dave
Lambo content... nice nice... Porsche content - Now you have my attention 😅
Please buy a crashed rs3 or rs6 and rebuild it
Lambadaaaa sensor 😅 love it bro
Nice job, car looks great, but please pronounce Porsche as it should be.
Porsche made the two cars identical but with the only difference being the roof style and some other bits and bobs
Anyone know what kind of lifts do they use there? Looks really cool going straight up with hydraulics and being flush with the floor.
Top bloke
Another monster vid. Well done Matt great to know all is well and they seem very cool at that Dealers ❤
Hey love the channel and have been a sub for a while now. Just a little bit of feedback re your sponsor of this vid.I don't doubt that Car Vertical works well in the UK and many other countries. Unfortunately here in Australia, I just paid $50 AU for a report on my Focus RS Mk3 and it gave next to no information and most of the "facts" and possible recall info was mainly for other Focus models. I feel a bit ripped off. No offense at all to you mate. Keep up the great work.
Birmingham has pulled one out the bag again. Big up Brum!
Ive had a few porsches, including a cayman S. One thing I will say is the service and how they treat you is second to none. Audi, BMW, Merc have nothing on them when it comes to how they treat their customers. I used to get a cup of coffee made for me everytime I walked through the door, sat down given inlimited cans of coke or whatever you want. Cakes etc and usually throw in some freebies. They let me take out the latest 911's for the entire day, no questions asked, just a class service all around! I remember going into bmw asking for a test drive on the new m4 at the time and they said no because id have to insure it myself! This was after arriving in a 110k Porsche carrera S 991.2. I litrally burst out laughing! Audi at my local chester dealer was even worst. Took them 30 minutes to just come and see me and when they did they couldnt have cared less about my business.
Nice video. Keep up the good work.
I keep thinking each car is getting better as I watch these journeys and I'm not wrong. Keep up the good work matt massive fan love watching your videos.
Awesome video. You are on the way to being a cultured gentleman, especially dropping the intro track to marriage of Figaro right at then, proof right there pal.
So cool
Who is not going to be nice to you and Hanna? And Josh was such professional.
its going to be a sad day when i'm up to date with Mat's videos. Haven't even started the Porsche build yet.
This was such an interesting visit to Porsche.
Love the colour 😍
Mat, tried using the discount code for “car vertical” by way of using the link in your video, it does not work! Comes up with “discount used or not available” 🤷‍♂️ What’s the story?
Amazing work mate as always. 💪
Great job!
I'm delighted for you Mat. You've smashed it out of the park again 👍
Superb
Genuinely thought that was Ellie Goulding when you went to Porsche!  Another great video, always love catching the rebuilds you do.
Great job Mat, Is the badge on the front bonnet is off center? (8.13)
LAMBA 🤣🤣🤣🤣
To be fair Matt we knew the ole girl had issue's,, this vid was always about how we were treated at the dealership.. And they passed with flying colours yes!! Thank you so much in today's world treating Matt as you did.. mucho power. Keep up the great work mate from New Zealand.
Enthusiasm 🤗🤗🤗 with a capitol E.
My favourite build to date 👍
Millionaire walks into a Porsche dealer and feels at home…😂
Great video, awesome that Porsche took the time to watch the videos.  Tried to check my car using your sponsor link and it has expired :(
I absolutely love that you are humble enough to let people inspect your work. It's actually the greatest opportunity to learn and will only make you better in the future. Congrats, the car looks amazing!
I noticed on your video that you have a Wallbox charger fitted to what looks like your new residence. Is this a hint of a possible new project and you are going to do an electric car at some point?
I think you deserve the red carpet treatment at any main dealer 👍
What about that Betayga? :)
Keep up the good work Matt. Great video. Also the brunette working at Porsche was my highlight.
Consider RPM Technik for the wheel alignment. 🤘 They are south of Milton Keynes (HP23 4QR) and are probably a better option for setting up a non-standard Porsche to how you want it. Everything from basic 4 wheel alignment to full corner weighted set up. (No affiliation). Porsche Solihull are a decent bunch, I was in there last week and that purple 718 is an acquired taste! Barney the dinosaur Purple anyone?
What I like about your videos is how easy it is to pull for you mate, when things go right we couldn't be happier for you. Great job Matt
Nice to see a high end dealer not look down their nose at customers,  Mercedes take note!  Viewing area with customer is such a brilliant idea why don't all dealers do this ? I thought the Cayman was the same as a Boxster ? How can your Cayman be category N if the roof needed replacing which is classed as structural ? No front plate either ????
Great video! The reason for the nylon cogs is the cogs strips to prevent the motor burning out or the mechanism destroying itself. They also use nylon cogs in folding mirrors, roof mechanisms for the same reason. It strips the teeth rather than damaging anything else.👍🏻
Well that made part of my Monday morning commute a  lot brighter. Cheers
How great was it that the Porsche tech had watched your build on this car.
Dude it may be a good idea to break down certain repairs and put them in separate titled videos as your so through and some people may be looking for certain repair videos they may miss when there all blended and you get more views 👍
Entertaining as ever.
That’s cos you’ve got a YouTube channel with nearly 1 mil subs playboy. Try walking in with flip flops and no street cred. Kick your manky ass out the door innit?
Class Matt, keep it up !!  Even sat in the same seat I sit in when I take the Cayenne S in !!
Top man josh🤘
8:12 YOUR AMBLEM IS OFFF CENTERRR
Nice work!  Proud of you!
Given the state of the car when you started, you`ve done a cracking job
Loving the Puccini ❤️ very classy 👍
Should even be on the road. This videos should be only for educational purposes , this car fixed like this shouldnt be allowed on the road.
Loving how the Porsche is looking !! What diagnostic tool are you using ? 3:28
Walk into any dealer with a camera and they’ll treat you like royalty 😆
If I will ever step in the UK in my life, it's my dream that I meet you Mat  You inspire me alot
Mat , your videos are honestly the best mate , I really wish I could do what you do it always looks a dream job. Thanks for the videos 😊
So to be fair watching that no one in the right mind would buy that porsche 🤣
Sorry mat Love your Videos  But Its Not porsch Its PORSCHE  😂😂😂
They are really nice down my local one in Exeter too, but they always sound shocked that I'm an owner coming in to buy parts to fit myself, don't think many Porsche owners do all their own work.
As a former Porsche employee, I loved to see you enjoyed your stay at Porsche dealership =)
Well done!
Nearly on 1million 🎉 been here since 50k or so 😅
Fair play to Porsche Solihull, I’ve drooled over cars there before, the next day after my lottery win, they will be taking my money. Lambos for show, Porsches for a pro.
That car looks awesome!!
Never ceases to amaze me how great this channel is. Full of positivity From Mat, his team, from the viewers comments. ❤ Love it 🤝
Legend
Great video , well it Dane out okay a few minor parts to do then you have a good car good luck 👍👍
Nice one MAT 👍....
Again one more video full with positivity, pretty smiles which put's you in a very, very good mood. I love the channel and I would want to wish Mat and Hanna all the health and luck in the world, you deserve it ! 🚗
Never thought I'd hear those words uttered - "They look all the same"
🔥🙏🙌
8:17 correct me if I'm wrong but the Badge looks slightly asymmetrically placed?
Your rich now.... you belong there Mat!
Literally  the best YouTube channel!!!!
That went well 👍👍👍
Turn dealership employees to Mat Fanboys🤣💯 you are such a gem
The car looks sick ngl💯🔥 we love Mat🇿🇦♥️
Lovely to see this! Keep it up!
cant imagine a dealer in America being so accommodating and being so thorough.  England dealers be waaay better than anything ive seen here in the states.  Looks like you did a great job repairing the porsche.
Great video and service from Porsche, the Technician was a credit to them.
Road to 1M subscribers💯
Been watching your videos religiously for the past year . Your the only car enthusiast I watch now. Love your videos ! God bless ! Much love from Kamloops British Columbia Canada !
Porsche Solihull BIG ups to you guys for the way you treated Mat, Greatest of respect from New Zealand.
Gorgeous car Mat. Really nice rebuilds as well. Thnx.
omg i thought that noise was the wipers against the glass🤣🤣 not the motor
Fine job Mat. You deserve it all buddy
Hmm for an Englishman I find it hard to understand how the "Instruments in the Dashboard are Clocks" or how a "two post lift (well it lifts the car up) can be called a Ramp?" Oh well language can always be good for a laugh.
Great video and all in all a good result. In regards to removing its cat status I think there are inspections you can have done at some MOT stations that if they deem the car repaired to the correct standard it’s accident record can be reset. Obviously a very detailed inspection but might be worth a try.
If I could find I would buy a one. On the fact the guy at the auto show help me win a bet that I couldn't fit
I'm happy to see that there is someone that knows what they are doing at the dealership. I was expecting someone who barely even knows what a porsche is.
Alotta hotties at Porsche! 😉 You got a passing grade Matt. 🤙 Good job! 👍
Nice vlog
Nice one, you;ve done a fabbo rebuild Mat and Hannah, worthy of more than 7 i reckon, closer to a 9 and 3/4s perhaps!
👍
"Someone like me, walking into a main dealership - it can almost feel as if I'm not supposed to be there".   Wow, what a humble and unassuming person you are, Mat!
damn bro you're making me want to do the same thing. I bought an eclipse gsx 2g manual dirt cheap like 4k. I'm fixing it up and in good condition they're selling for 15k or if it's modified 20k+. The cars are very sought after because they're somewhat rare and have the same engine as the evo 4g63t as well as being awd it's basically a 2 door evo. I find it very easy to fix these cars so seeing you do this makes me think I can do the same thing, flip them, and make good money.
Awesome job. Like I’ve said before you are very talented and I can assure you, that you are doing more to your cars than most mechanics do in a lifetime of wrenching. We can be so critical of ourselves and what we do, but from watching your videos you have nothing to be ashamed of. You are doing stellar work and being a great influence for others to get in there and get their hands dirty.👏
The green car on the showroom floor at 18:06 gap on the fuel cover door is tighter around the bottom versus the gap on the top just like your car but the Porsche tech pointed that out as a flaw on your car.
Absolutely smashing it with content on both channels. Provides some educational advice as well as a decent video to do the same kinda job at home in a garage or in a small unit. Keep it up bro and you actually prove that this kinda shit is possible regardless of financial situation that anyone may be in. As you said in your video about the TT and houses. Anyone can do this shit as long as you put your mind and all into what you desire 💯💯💙
They've literally told you how to pronounce the name...Porch-uh, yet you refuse to pronounce it prop-uh-lay
I personally think this is your best looking rebuild.  It's stunning
My local Porsche dealer's attitude towards me on first meeting is why I'm not on my 3rd GT car. I've need treated far worse at a Honda dealership.
Great job on bringing 👏🏼 these nice vehicles back to life with the Armstrong twist.
Would I have taken the same risk? Not a hope in hell! Parts here in Australia make fixing a car with this much damage unviable. Not only the cost of the parts, but shipping costs and time as well. The only places you can do what your doing would be the UK, and the US. To rebuild this in Australia would cost so much it just wouldn't be worth it. Most cars here are written off because of those reasons. Whatever you spent doing up the Porsche, you can add another 35k- 45k (AUD) to it, and another 6 weeks at least (for postage of parts).
Amazing build Mat. I know what you mean about walking into a porsche dealership etc I feel the same 😄 (wannabe porsche owner).
Kumho tyres on a Porsche? Really? 🤯
Do a c6 corvette Matt!
7/10... Based on the time and effort you put into it... Still, it's a great work.. Waiting for more fun and entertaining works from you... Cheers...
1 Million soon i am so happy for you ❤
Not bad 👍
Brilliant job. I am amazed that, what appeared to be a basic cover plate is essential to the wheel alignment. It must feel good though to get such a good comment about the car from Porsche. Well done.
Hey Matt, smashed it again. So enjoy your vids
Wow , Outstanding brilliance mate . Definitely get a  category car!, definitely brining it to You ,   Well done 👏 for all the videos 🎉🎉✔️✅
A little story ,it was time to buy a new car went to Mercedes to buy a AMG GT as we looked at the car we were getting the vibe that they did not think we should own one me and my wife are in are late sixties , anyway so after a rude sales manager interaction we decided not to buy one even though we could have paid for the car easily .  So after looking further Volvo and Cadillac we bought a new Porsche from a very freindly dealer ,what a bunch of asses.
Hello, I’d like to know what is your application to get your car body and other car equipment, please
A great transformation, one question, would you call a Bentley a " Bentle" no probably not , so why call a Porsche a " Porsch" ? Picky I know but very annoying!
Congratulations on reaching 1 million subscribers Matt! Keep up the goodtimes & great work.  If you ever need to escape the miserable weather, come visit us in Australia.
Did anyone else notice the Porsche emblem being off centre?
It’s hard not to like your personality!! And you’re also excellent mechanic!!
Hana is right they all look the same.
A lot of people mention how well Porsche treats their customers
mat i would love to meet you!  you seem so down to earth and extremely motivational!
Love the channel Mat!!! Have you done an RS3 yet….? The power gains are truly vast. Would be a great build
I LOVE YOU BRO & I LOVE WATCHING YOU & YOUR CAR BUILDING 👍🏻😊❤️
can i have the car?
Would be dope if you do another Porsche if Josh could make a guest appearance to help out
Matt, amazing work!  you absolutely knocked this out of the park!
Amazing car, loved this video so much
So close to that mill subs now 💪
Awesome
Snapped teeth from some frost?  If that's honestly what did it, that's pathetic.  I've turned my truck on with the wipers embedded in snow and ice and they just bust free.  I would not be impressed with a high end car that breaks cause the temps went below 0.
Once you get that undertray and alignment, it'll be a 10!!  Awesome build series so far, been really enjoying it! Car looks amazing!
👌🏼
PLEASE get a few wireless microphones. It will greatly improve these already awesome videos.
Porsche have never done a v8 right? 🤣😂🤣
Another great video Mat. Such a wonderful job on the Porsche. And big thanks to Porsche, Solihull for being so welcoming of Mat.
Lam da sensor
Matt you need to invite that Porsche mechanic to your shop one day , I’m sure he would love it as he watches your videos!
Thanks bro lifted my mood
Just got back from work let's have abit of Mat Armstrong
They were good with you, and you are helping them generate interest in their brand. Lovely restoration, nice video - enjoy your car.
"Like a drug thaaat.. Matt just can't denyyy.."  ☠
Smashed it again Matt great video
I wish we could drive straight pipes cars in Switzerland 😂
Great one
i have tattoos all over both my arms so i always covered them but again after a while they became a talking point
I'm a fan of Air Bag Team as I have used them recently and they were very helpful with the airbags I needed. However, they were trying to sell reconditioned seat belts for £108 but I could buy them brand new from Mercedes for £95. So always check new prices before buying 2nd hand or reconditioned.
must admit that 'respect' is something you dont always get. When i owned a Range Rover i always felt like I should be dressed up once they got to know me I was okay being a little more relaxed with my dress code but some of the other customers were up their own asses
I want to see more of that glass magic at the end.
great vid mate! also, it's "lam - da," the b is silent.
🧡❤️
Ngl I agree with Hannah lol they all look the same
Excellent as always thank you and God bless 🙏
Well done Porsche. You make the best cars and your dealers should be welcoming and a fun place to be.
For starters the steering wheel is on wrong side! 😂
Love Hannah’s comments! 🤣👏🏻
Success 👍👍👍
Please! What body kit is this? I need one badly 😂
W"hat have you done now!!
So much work to repair this nice PORSCHE. You win, MAT, congratulations. The car looks better than before the crash.
I'm surprised you didn't go to the porsche dealer on that roundabout in Leicester lol. Anyways, Great video Mat!
Well done!
Top video yet again Mat.
Awesome Matt I don't know how any one could dislike you pal your a bloody awesome human being! ❤️
Great video of great car well re-built big Pat on the back Mat 👍👍👍👍👍👍
I have a 718 Cayman S which is stock, in case you wanted to do a side by side comparison at any point.  Yours looks way better than mine, and probably sounds 100X better. ❤
1. Open video 2. Like video before it even starts because I always like the content  3. Wonder what Mat will do when he reaches his first million subscribers
I’m not a fan of the Cayman, it’s like an amalgamation of a GT4 with a GT4 RS (the spoiler isn’t even correct, it only looks similar)  I’d also recommend getting the PDLS headlights.
Brilliant Mat! Great car, great fix. Well done. Onto the next one....
Yeah that's my qualm with Porsche too...unless you know what model is what, they all look the same. You can have a GT2RS parked next to a base 911 and people who aren't familiar with the differences would have no idea one is worth several times the other. With a Lamborghini or Ferrari, even non-car people know what it is. Yours looks great regardless tho, love that yellow.
Nice... May have changed my opinion about Porsche they all seemed really nice.
I went from a Skyline R33gtr with lots of Jap mods to a 911 Carrera 2 3.6. I must say i was disappointed in the performance but coming from 650BHP to 320 was always going to be so. At present i run a Ftype R convertible 550. Which i love to bits but hardly ever use. Sad. Keep up the fantastic video's Big thumbs up Mat. Regards. Steve.
what a great service team to not make you feel out of place, good service.
I was gonna hit some porn then remembered Mat had a new video and shelved former
How much did it cost to fully repair the car?
that Porsche guy looks exactly like a real life version of "Hanover Fist" in the animated movie "Heavy Metal!" FROM 1982   ............  ;-)))))))))))))
That was really decent of porsche to let you film
Good to see porsche, they knew the big g was coming
Such a lovely car, you done yourself proud with this car. I would say he gave a fair rating. It a 10/10 really.
Amazing what you have done to the Porsche, have you enquired or looked into the NEC Auto Sport International Birmingham (showing the hard work and what Cat N etc can look like after rebuild) i was their today epic to have seen you with your collection.
Love your videos Mat , keep up the good work
Nice paint,hopefully not a cover up wrap.
Love that - didn’t think Porsche would want to get involved - service manager was a babe too 🤣
Mat, good video. Your comment at the end about them being down to earth is my experience.  They like people who are passionate  about cars, porsches in particular...porsche-files as they call us.
Why do they finish fast 😭😭😭😭I didn't even watch for 5mins and it's already done 😭mat your videos are very short
I’ll never forget being 12 years old and on the way from my grandparents, we stopped off at Porsche Towcester, my 9 year old brother was obsessed with cars  and we were greeted by one of the sales staff and my dad explained that the young lads loved cars and just wanted to have a look, they said this wasn’t an issue! 5 minutes later the sales staff came back with posters of the new 911, carrera GT and the cayenne for myself and my brother also a couple of pens, key rings and baseball caps ! I’ve currently got an RS7 but my next car will be a Porsche from this dealership! ❤
Shout out to Hannah saying they all look the same, she’s kind of right 😂
Love how a tech guy at Porsche watched your video and was clearly in awe of your presence Matt ! Gone of the days of you feeling out of place at these big dealerships like Bentley! You are now a motoring guru/genius
Hannah is right about them looking all the same.
Beautiful job you've done on it.❤
Funny how modern cars have all these sensors to regulate the car and tell you what's wrong but then the sensors themselves break stop the car working and become the problem.
Great job, 7 out of 10 from the Porsche dealership.Glad you found out about the damaged bracket BEFORE the wheel alignment. Really enjoying following along with these (Re) builds.
Down to earth and modest, pleasure to watch and you deserve every success. Look forward to the next instalment.
Sooooo close to hitting the 1 MILLION subscribers Mat! 🤞 won't be long fella.🌟🌟🌟🌟
I'm a Porsche guy since I've spent time in the backseat of a Carrera 3.0 from 1976 as an eight year old boy. Hooked. I could identify the car by the smell ;).  Now, a few years later, I'm still with Porsche.  And yes, they are expensive, but no, you don't need to be posh to feel perfectly home at a Porsche dealership.
porche is all the same new 911 etc
upmarket Volkswagen thats why it will over heat
Urgh! 🙈 What was so cool on the instrument panel?????????? 🤪😁 Someone tell me please 🤣
Great video! I've been using Porsche Solihull for a few years now and they have always been very friendly and professional. Also, their servicing prices are reasonable compared to other less prestigious brands in my experience.
I love how unpretentious the staff at Porsche were.
18:25 - hannah -" you're not a Gen-El-Man" 😂😂😂😂
Good main dealer network with them no snobbery at all
Mat you need to get the car to centregravity at atherstone for the geometry, they do a far better job and will set the car up for you not just factory settings
Really nice car!! Keep it up with the great content👍
I Can only wish I had This kind of knowledge. You have all my respect dude!
ah jezsus 7/10 was harsh
Looking wise I think this best car you've done purely on looks lovely 👌
Excellent Matt
Dear Matt & Team !! ....SUPERB Vlog ............Bless you & You're Team............ Peace !!
Matt..Do the cat N and S write offs have to have a full Vosa check to verify they are fit and worthy to be put back on the roads..
Can I advertise my exhausts as “Porsche Approved” now then? 😂😂😂
I Wish The episodes where longer
I can’t believe it £120 for a o2 sensor on your car Nissan is asking £170 for one on my Nissan QQ the kick in the balls is I only replaced it 12 month ago it’s saying it’s a high voltage from the sensor that’s making it fail. Sooooooo fed up with my car will you swap lol
Savage Mat the porsche is an epic car 🤟🤟🤟🤟
great job Mat,loved that lilac / purple porsche but not as nice as the signal yellow,it suits it perfectly with the full body kit!
Getting close to the 1M!! 👏
you build a beauty of a car!
I hope Bentley will do the same when we rebuild their car... "wink wink"😊
I too felt intimidated when walking into Porsche, they could not have been more helpful and knowledgeable
Great video..
Lol great video
You have to take that as a win Mat, congrats😁😁😁
I had a buddy at Uni  (Plymouth, UK) who's dad was a very wealthy builder.  He went to Porsche to buy a new car with his building gear and treated him like trash (Looked down on him).  So he simply went to another Porsche dealer who didn't make judgement.  That dealer lost a sale.  For sure some dealers (even Infiniti in the USA) like to create an upperclass vibe.   Excellent to see you were treated with respect, like it should be :)
PROTECT THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS!!!
Gratulations. Very impressive!
Nearly at 1M subs 💯💯 Keep it up Mat
All the prestige car parts you save on via eBay , how do you check if those parts aren’t from stripped down stolen vehicles? Like the Porsche  btw.
Whats the name of the colour on the alloys pls..
You are just a joy to watch, thank you 👍
I wanna be a Porsche guy ..
Fascinating as always.
Main dealer inspection after work not done by them almost feels like "ye its alright considering your an amateur"
If a Porsche dealer makes you feel unwelcome go to another one, some centres have a horrible vibe about them. Where I live we have a dealer about 25mins away, they are stuck up. So I travel 60mins and one city over to see the other dealer in my area. They are fantastic, so welcoming and they love talking about Porsches.
It’s simple if you can afford a Porsche. You fit in Mat
Lovely car
Nice stuff Mat , my old home town , I was born in Solihull , by the Rover factory , good to hear they treated you right. Car looks killer
Brilliant
… Well Mat … and everyone at Team Mat … … Well done 👌🏼😎… it’s incredible to watch all your projects come to fruition … Imposter syndrome…. I would be just the same …  Great content and natural presentation as always… Yet again 💯
Name and shame the seat belt company, seems like they totally tried to fob you off!! Something as important as a seatbelt, not good
Isn’t there a Porsche garage in Leicester?
Matt said; “Put the wipers on, to clear the lights?” 🧐😂 Was this a Error code light on the cluster you were referring to Matt? Because I Typically put wipers on to clear a windscreen! 😉😂  Great video, car looks incredible! Far better than my pampered 986, and that was never crashed! 😂😂🤦‍♂️
Brocolli
Love it, The Perfect way to begin the new week in Australia, nothing but positive vibes from Mat as always. Awesome work on the Porsche mate.
it is a Porsche with an e at the end. it is than Porsche not Porsch
Like the Signal Yellow...not a wing fan though.
Need to have a new video every Sunday it’s filled that top gear gap that’s missing 😩
I remember when you would jack a car up and get your back dirty 😀
Top tier content. 👍
I do like it when dealerships let you behind the scenes. Well done Porsche! Mat this car is awesome!
We have had the same treatment from Porsche Silverstone with our Panamera rebuild... Great staff and so helpful. Great video fella.
Done a fantastic job with that Porsche.... top work, i think the Porsche guy was actually quite impressed 👌
Great video Mat, it was really interesting to hear Josh talk through the relevant elements  of the car. You should get Josh down again, a wealth of knowledge.
Not sure how he could tell the windscreen is after market just by looking at it.
You’ve got a car charger on the side of your house. Have you gone electric without telling anyone 😮
Enjoyed the content...👍
Nothing better at the end of the day than browsing auto trader watching these videos. it’s become part of the routine at this point😂 very quickly became one of my favourite YouTubers along with Alex kersten both top lads living the dream. Quality content all the time, everytime❤
I always come me away smiling from your video’s Matt thanks 😊
Interesting inspection well done matt
brilliant vid mat
Congrats, the car looks very nice.
haha yes hannah is on my side dont like porsches at all really hahaha
Excellent work with that  porsch, definitely a keeper.
Signal yellow? The car is orange... just an observation.
Good work That man and Porsche 👍🏼
So good to watch Mat, and the folks at Porsche were just how you'd want them to be. Seemed really helpful, honest and supportive.   Great to see your work on the Porsche get the tick of approval too!
Why would they treat you anything other than great? They want your car and spares business, even if they know they can't get your repair business!!😆
That yellow 💛 is popping
Almost 1.000.000 subscribers 🤩🤩
Porsche really is a brand that is going places.  Head and shoulders above other so called premium marques.
Killing it Matt. 🤜🏽
hanna is right, porsches from a distance all look the same. but defenetly great cars.
stunning
Wld the Porsche technician have driven the car or put his family in it?
I built that Porsche garage. (worked on the steel and cladding)
really worth a trip to the Porsche museum at Stuttgart.  Unlike many car museums, this really conveys the love Porsche put into the design of their card (I don't even own a Porsche!)
Porsche-a!!
mat sundays great way to end the week!
Does Car vertical work in South Africa?
I love Porsche
Absolutely brilliant rebuild Matt! Truly impressed! The color is absolutely stunning!😍
My experience with Porsche is the same... I mean I didn't rebuild my car or anything but I did have 2003 911 Carrera that had some issues... They were always super nice super helpful and cut the bill when it came to payment... I think this is just generally how they do business since I have same experience as you but in central eu so totally different country... Really cool to see.
Well done Mat. Proper courage taking your Cayman for inspection. The mechanic certainly knew his onions.
Absolutely brilliant rebuild Matt! Truly impressed! The color is absolutely stunning!
Matt, your channel is by far my fav car channel. Voice and accent is very soothing to listen to lol
Sitting by the fire on a Sunday evening with a hot chocolate and a Mat Armstrong video, best way to spend the night! 😂
Where does one learn these skills? I wouldn’t expect a mechanic’s certification to be enough for this level of work. Hope someone with experience can chime in.
7/10? Cheeky beggar ;)
Love your finished Porsche Mat, especially the colour! However, agree with Hanna when she says they all look the same in the showroom! 😂
at 12:46 you can hear the technician pronounce porsche correctly…
Brill  videos
Big shoutout to Josh seemed very professional and happy to be on camera. Loving the vids
never heard a person say wiper motor like "Whypa Mota", gives the wiper motor a whole new dimension
Not bad mate I went too Porsche Renfrew with my 911 and got told to come back and proof i owned it so I never went back get all the help i need from design 911 .
They being Gentleman at Porsche means they treat people with respect and have a friendly attitude. We have a new one In Ferndown not been in but looks great. There old site is now Tesla. The car looks great I’ll give it a 10 out of 10 Matt we’ll done.
Can’t believe Josh missed the missing front number plate… 😆🙈
Porsche dealers were lovely to me, Big UP,Porsche Nottingham ❤️❤️
Mat:  ".....Poorsh" Josh: "....Poor-sher" Mat: ".....Poorsh" Josh: "....Poor-sher"
So what do they want you to fix to get a 10/10 rating?? 🤔
Great video and kudos to Porsche Solihull.
I do have a 2014 M5 F10 with 6 speed manual, stock. With only 8000 miles on it. In brand new condition if your ever Interested to own one I'm willing to sell it to the right person. Only 577 6 speed manual build world wide.
The brunette at Porche was fit 🤙
It baffles me that sometimes you still feel like you don't belong at a Porsche dealer haha. Trust me, with almost a million subs, any supercar dealer will be proud to have you in their establishment!
Literally work at the bmw dealership in the body shop next to Porsche I’m absolutely gutted I missed him I’m in there all the time 😭
The Cayman looks epic, and as usual, top job from MA 👌🏽👌🏽
That back window blind is great
"you're not a gentleman" lol
That was great, many thanks
Was going to bed until I saw a new video. Got my priorities right
Matt u only went there for the goody bag 👏👏👏👏
A million subscribers gets you bet service lol 😁😁
All power to you dude massive job great result.
Nearly a million subs Mat! Well done 👏
Enjoy your videoes Ma as always.  Thank you for your efforts. Peace out to you also.
As always a banger video! wish there could be a matt armstrong video every day! Well done matt, amazing rebuild as always!
Wicked video Matt and hats off to you for what you have done to this car it's epic mate. Big respect to Porsche they were great too. Keep them coming mate great to watch on a Sunday.
Had my 964 Turbo for 22 years and recently added a 3.2 Boxster S love Porsches mint brand 👍👍
Have you got someone doing your videos now? The production seems to have taken a leap in the last few, really impressive.
Great video. So nice to see didn’t look down to you at Porsche. Makes you appreciate them even more. Well done Matt 👍👍
Josh is a sound fella
Looks awsome
Porsche was and always will be a driver focused Auto mobil. They are the best in what they do. All we have to do now is teach Mat to say Porsch"E" and not Porsch. a Big like anyway..👍
I remember when Sundays was bath night.. now its Mat night..
Must take the car to a cold country up into to the mountains and go skiing
Porsche garage in Leeds are the same , well the people I've come across and sent cars too.
I'd buy it. Looks and sounds awesome 👌
Porsche best brand there is and most of their cars
Hey Mat what model is your Autel diagnostic tool?
got lucky at that Porsche dealer .. many are up themselves ..  I say that as an owner
I’d like to watch you rebuild a mclaren, my favourite cars
What an enjoyable video, 🎉keep up the amazing content bro 😎
Why not Leicester Porsche?
Fair play to the dealer, they did a decent job and very friendly.
They could never treat you bad, you are top builder they just have afraid so give to you a 7 that would be a 10 with some minor minor errors not faults, they just dont want no one to be like you keep going!
Yes ;)
Road to 1 million subs boys
This car just pulls my strings a just love every inch of it I hope u treat it nice
Sure i seen you in london on Saturday 🫵 Top content as usual 👌
Look like fork lift truck fork crushed the plug when loaded at savage auction
Matt, that car looks amazing, what a transformation 👏👏😎😎
That technician is actually really good. He seems to know pretty much every detail of how the car is built and designed.
I wouldn't get to excited, my experience of OPC is piss poor! The vacuum system for the exhaust valve is not connected to the vacuum system for cooling,  I find a really good Porsche indy far better!
I rated the wink before checking if they were mugging you off
Great job done. Again. Hope your dad got that oil pump part for next sundays video 😉
Deffo a 9 nearly a 10!
Super cool and humble dude. Wishing you more continued success!
I agree with Hannah,  however, I look at it like I look at flat screen TV's, they all look the same, but all have differences 👍👍👍
The undercarriage could use some washing and clear the mud and debris
Milion is soooo close
A lambda sensor is a 5 wire plug pre cat, o2 sensor is post cat 4 wire
Sunday roast , footy and matts videos. What a life 😂 👍
Sweeeet. Well done Mat 👏
The waffle house has found its new host
🤘🤘🤘 Since  audi 🤝
I live about 5 minutes from a porsche dealer. I love looking at their inventory. I see GT3's GT3rs' and even a few pink porsches. I live in a tiny village and if it were not for the porsche dealer, there wouldn't be many cool cars around (ignoring the fact that 30 seconds away from my house is a guy who owns a 720s LOL)
Cayman looks absolute 🔥🔥👌
Best channel ever
Well done overall!  And bravo to the folks at that Porsche dealership for being cool...
1 million subs soon 😮 well deserved 🎉
Must take my car to the MOT station you use, no front number plate, illegal tints and exhaust and no advisories 🤣🤣
awesome stuff Mat!!!
Gained a like an a sub 🎉 Never seen or heard of you but here to stay! Hand tats are sick btw
Is that girls name at Porsche Maisie? Think she went to my school
It's not that the vacuum line is associated with the water pump. With unmetered air from the vacuum line, the car is running leaner than it realizes when it's in open loop, aka wide open throttle. And that makes it run hotter.
Mat your attitude with can do spirit and enthusiasm has inspired many of us and taught us never give up. No matter how difficult the built, you  will find a way to make it work. Love all your videos!
Great video matt but for your next one you must get an electric car make use of that home charging point 👉 😀
They didn't treat you so bad because you're a big YouTuber and this is a free commercial.
Great results Matt. You're positivity always pays off
What song is that at 10:00? My Bloody Valentine will not be happy, it’s note for note a copy of Soon.
Porsche dealerships are always the nicest 😌
Porsche is all about building long lasting relationships with owners. If they treated you well every time you went to the dealership with even a rebuild, you’re more likely to buy a new one when the time comes. They aren’t there to make a quick buck
My grandad lives right literally right around the corner from there that’s crazy
Mat is on his way to a million subscribers.
Well done brother. Car looks sick. Much respect from South Africa
Again, the perfect colour choice and the tuning upgrades are perfectly matching. Well done!
What I enjoy about this channel is how much Mat doesn’t mind sharing mistakes and things to learn.  He knows a zillion more than me, but he doesn’t lord this over me
Exactly,  mat Armstrong Sundays!
Fascinated by this channel I know F😂😂Kall about cars but this channel is great
Matt at this point I like the video before it’s even started
the only one betting ..you shouldve betted 5000$...
Nailed it again Hannah as everyone knows your the brains of the operation 😂😂😂😂
Congratulations Mat !!! Well deserved !!!
So many issues with a car with a fresh mot 🤔
Really impressed with Porsche Solihull and Josh in particular. Very sporting, knowledgeable and professional.
Almost 1M sub! 😍
Fantastic looking car!! Definitely going to drop some big money on tickets when you get to the giveaway 💪👍
Mate you got me hook on your vids...
I like hearing good experiences from the dealers. I'm a dealer tech myself and i always like to help out the customer and go that little bit extra for them. The dealer world needs more people with care and passion instead of people just spannering
I'm surprised that the wiper doesn't use a "smart" motor by now. Many wiper systems have current monitoring, wiper sweep by motor reversal instead of full rotation crank, and adaptive wiper travel to deal with ice build up.
Excellent 👍
Looks beautiful, brother, amazing. ❤❤❤❤❤
Fair play to the garage for allowing the videoing of that.  Some dealers would be to up themselves to allow it.  Nicely done.
you and stradman might be the only car youtubers i really really enjoy watching. keep grinding big man.
Super Video, Mat
Still want it love that car
I like the fact the technician watches your content 👊🏻👍
The second VW brand to inspect one of Mats cars.
8:11 WHO put that logo on??? OMG!!
Fantastic video, look forward to going to work tomorrow now, Thanks Mat
You’re the best cartuber ever!
Matt, please, drop the bonnet like a good boy. You’ll dent it doing the sit and push method.
Never get tired of watching this guy getting his butt kick by car's 😂 sorry Mat
Well deserve 7 Matt and what a great chap Josh was bet he is a Blue Nose KRO
Fantastic 👍👍👍
Yea Boy! Mat has come round to become a Porsche man. So proud as I own a Cayman myself and it is what has made me become a fan of Porsche too. The cars are top notch, Fast, and Tough dependable cars. I own a Cayenne too that I purchased after my Cayman and neither cars have given me any problems in the 5+ years I've owned them. Well done Mat 💯
Such an awesoome looking Cayman S! That GT4 spec thoughhhh...lit bruh!
In one of your previous videos I posted the name of a company where you can take you repaired vehicle for inspection which recategorises damaged repaired vehicles. Autoalign Inspections,  if you Google it you'll find their website. Only company in the uk that does it I believe.
Love fast beetles
I see the million getting closer and closer
I honestly don’t know why eBay motors haven’t sponsored this channel yet
Umm these videos dont count labour.
Painted it in signal yellow? It's orange mate
Good video , honestly was nice to see a dealership that professional
She’s stunning! Cars nice too mat
great porsche video looks good matt well done on your 962k subscribers
Worked at Porsche for 3years. They held that facade upright.
What happened to the E24😭
Mmmm Hannah xx
A ramp and lift are two different things in the United States my friend
Sunday roast with mat armstrong in the background👌
Love the Porsche so much, wing looks sick!  Going for my own first project soon 🤞
Mat: Porsches are for gentleman’s  Hannah: You’re not a gentleman, you’re a BMX rider  😂
This was enjoying
Ca-a-li-ik conver-a in-it.  I love me a thick English accent.
Such a nice colour
Really nice people at the Porsche dealer!
Yeah the Porsche people are cool and the cars are amazing.   Good job on the Cayman!
Awesome Mat, that exhaust vacuum is a weird set if I could cause overheating issues.
Great video. That Porsche tech guy wasn't arrogant or superior at all - he was actually just really nice and professional. Makes me want to buy a Porsche
The oxygens sensor plug was unplugged to get more money out of the insurance company, old trick.
Your porsche is sick Mat. cat n or not
I wonder why this comment has more likes🤔
I’m an hour late🥲🙇🏽‍♂️
Hannah is right, they all look the same.🤫
It's amazing to see the rise of the Matt Armstrong channel. It just goes to show, people want to see an honest personality who genuinely seems excited about what he's doing. Great job Matt 1M subs very soon! How can we find out your appearance schedule? Any Manchester stops on the cards?
Mat, have you thought about the fact that some brands will come after you…? Until then, go for it!
Can't wait for your videos, I felt your trepidation going under a Porsche inspection, but wow high praise, and well deserved. .. keep em coming Mat.
I like Josh, he was friendly but professional and clearly knew what he was talking about 👌🏻
I could feel that tension and it’s not my car , get same feeling at MOT time 😂
You were the only person bidding is a LIE, you may of been the only person in the live auction to bid. There would of been lots of bids in the pre live auction. Copart give nothing away. Why do you LIE & BIG yourself up all of the time?
Hannah is right…they look all the sameeeee… I’ve tried so much get most the model names but it’s difficult lol
Great build and the colour looks stunning.
Nice one Mat 👌 Its amazing how this car has come together. It think it needs to trip to Monaca 👀
Good result, Porsche have a good attitude.
What (Autel scanner) do you use Matt
I'm not even that much of a car person and I watch all mats videos. 🥶🥶🥶🥶
Great job Mat, you’re nearly there; no doubt you’ve seen the GT4 on copart 🤩👍
It's Porsche, the employees get paid well so they are happier and kinder to customers than MCD/KFC burger flipper for minimum wage.
enjoying the video 😊😊#roadtomill
Hopefully you gonna rebuild a GT3 RS or GT2 RS in the near future.
Please do a turbo upgrade on the Cayman and make it faster than a GT4 RS
How come you went to Solihull? The dealer in Leicester is only around the corner from your mates at Lamborghini? Car looks awesome in the sun light.
Refreshing honest video all round 😊
Great video as always Mat
Brilliant viewing matt 👏
From a fellow Porsche owner you can’t beat them 😉 👍🏼
A car producer that also produces nice human beings to stand behind their vehicles - great video
Great watching again Matt. Every main dealer should make you feel welcome and its good Porche got it right, an awful lot do not.
We all know porshes are just glorified VW Beetles.  But that doesn't take away that they are glorious indeed.
Great piece of work, so far.
Amazing video Mat ! I'm pretty often doing kinda the same as you, buying totaled or flooded cars around and try to win the challenge to completely rebuilt them and do the right work at the right price on it! (thanks breakers , internet, used parts :D) I'm from Switzerland and i really enjoy the passion you're showing in your work and your videos!! amazing!
🔥
Nice
Mat you need to take that Porsche to ES Motors 👀👀👀👀👀
That's the most beautiful Cayman S I´ve ever seen. Regards from Germany
We here 🇿🇦🇿🇦
I no this place all to well were I work but not this branch
I've rebuilt a lot wrecked late model trucks and last 3% of the repairs always take the longest amount of time for some reason. All the little parts that bring the vehicle back to 100% seem to fight you the most. I couldn't imagine how bad a over engineered  Porsche would be to rebuild.
helllllllllo,you are my most favourite Youtuber.your vids is just so enjoyable.thanks for being the best lol .always enjoying from South Africa.
good for you guys.
Nice Job on the Porsche. One proposal Mat, do a proper and solid plug to the vacuum pipe (exhaust) just to avoid any leakage and engine issue.
Mat well done.
how long has Ellie Goulding worked for porsche? 10:15
You come across as such a genuine bloke
38k away from a million subs, the MA community growing rapidly but all well deserved.
Not even started the video yet (ads) and all ready given it a like as it's always good!
Never know until you try
To be fair Matt you are getting god like status Porsche was always going to be nice to you...great video 👍
Porsche receptionist. DING  can no one say bought for buying
Shame that "Car Vertical" does not work on Isle of Man cars...
Great
Nice Volkswagen
One big mistake man... wrong side drvng wheel... rest look ok
I’m not gonna lie you make me wanna fix my car nowadays Matt. I’m addicted to your videos and it’s length doesn’t even matter
A 7 from a Porsche dealer is getting up there Matt, well done chap 👍
Yha brother you did your self a SLAP on the back there 🎉 💥🕺💥 Weldon mait.
Nothing makes me happy than to watch mat,s videos😢❤❤
Love how optimistic mat is and the fact his mates and gf are always there with him makes it even more special
I was praying that you would stop saying "Porsh"...
Any Porsche is my dream car, I figure if mats got it. I should give it a shot in the future! Lovin the videos man!
hannahs proably the only person i know that goes into a porsche dealership and says 'they all look thew same'
I used to watch top gear on Sundays when J. Clarkson was in it. But now I’m watching Mr Armstrong youtube videos! Well done buddy. Your future is bright! ❤
Love this build. Great job and that is a dream car of mine and well done Porsche. 🦾👍
Who cares what the Porsche wanker thinks about Matts car?
Well done
Mat, fantastic result at the Porsche main dealership. Glad the technician knew of your channel!! No surprise, though.  Your Cayman S just popped among those well presented cars.  Kudos that you took this on. Most would have been intimidated but you thrive on it. Crash damaged / repaired / modified cars rule, with HWBT, anyway :)
Do Kumho make N rated tyres?
Great advert for Porsche.  Great to know they take a pragmatic respect to their customers. 👏
Honestly Matt what you have achieved in the last year in amazing! You should be very proud of yourself. Your doing a Great job and a pleasure to watch every week. Nearly popped past after a motorcycle race meeting at Mallory as I saw your unit and you messing around 😂
Actually met Mat at porsche that day. Was a pleasure meeting him and the car looks just as good in real life. 👍
Another one of those spectacular MA videos. Well done Mat.
Awsome vid watching with the old man today and he pointed out how you replaced wheeler dealers for him haha
This car is gorgeous. Such an amazing transformation.
Nice series man  Btw, love from india
It sounds wicked
Unlike my local Mercedes dealer in Norwich, who are a bunch of snobbs; and they don't even have a decent product anymore!
Watched you from the start Mat! Amazing show. Thanks.  What freebies did you get off Porsche? Dying to know pal!
Mat got to say I think the Porsche is my favourite to date absolute loving everything about it, 👏
Matt, have you ever considered taking one of your crash damaged cars to be inspected and recategorised? Autoligh near you, would make a cracking video!
Close to 1 million now
Superb videos matt can’t wait to see a performance suv
Think the Porsche needs to go for a cog score now
They are happy you kept one of their cars on the road,had you taken the car to them to fix it they would have scraped it because it would have cost way more than the car was worth,so you saved it from the scrap yard,you should be proud of it.
Yeah boi!
Another great video, getting closer to the magic million subscribers 💪💪💪
Looks ace Iv watched nearly all your videos and kelp looking out for more I’ve already watched this one so need your next one lol😅
Such a cool car
Porsche is my favorite sport car…your yellow demon came out great and hope you enjoy it to its fullest.  Great channel Matt, looking forward to your next video.
Amazing job on the Porsche! Can you share which diagnostics tool you used to read out the errors?
Based on all your vidoes for this car id say porsche came out of this with a solid 10/10,they actually seem like genuinely good guys
Big respect to Porsche dealership Solihull👍👍👍
Hey Mat where can I buy diagnostic tool?
porsche cars are finest engineering ....i have had 15 or so and regret selling every one and want a boxster back in my life...
Lovely. The way they welcomed you. 🎉🎉🎉
Must be very satisfying to be told how good the car is that you've literally brought back from the dead.  👍👍👍👍
I have a 981 Cayman S. I really like the look of the wing you installed. I am wondering if you could add a link to purchase the same wing? I am also wondering if you have found any issues with the win after install?
Keep on keeping on fella - car looks lush thanks to your efforts and determination!  :-)
Mat never fails to entertain. Not gonna lie mat's videos are highly addicting.Keep up the good work.💪💪💪
It's always important to double check part numbers before replacing the part. If it's not the same, what the heck, just replace it anyway.
awesome colour. the car looks wicked. glad the inspection went ok, at least you learned a few things what defo needed to know aswell 😄 👍
Porsche paint got orange peel from factory. Why cant they fix it.
Matt we need more building videos 👍
Love your videos...would like to see you do a every day car like a qashqai,  and turn it into something crazy...qashqai nismo???
My fav build so far🔥🔥🔥 Looking forward to the 2K23 content 🚀
Least you can get a proper geo set up from string theory after you replaced the undertray.
9 minutes 37 seconds in, " potentially a lemon ". Wooh wooh leave me outta this 😂😂
Don't blame Matt & the technician guy from Porsche, for wearing glasses! When inspecting under the car, two times iv had crap go in my eye, having to go 2 the bloody eye clinic 2b removed ow! Car looks sick now I can see! 👀🤙
For the wreck it was, to what it came out to be. That's one sweet Cayman.. colour wheels and all.. well done Mat. Love the content. One day I wish to be on your level and experience.
His critique shows their standards. You've done one hell of a job chief
Another great video mate, and one that is a testament to your success. Top job. The car looks fantastic now
Hour long videos!?👀🤞🤣🤣
GREAT WORK👍💯👊
you gotta find a wrecked 911! You won’t regret it, definitely!
Mat on route to a million subscribers 🙌
Mat is a proper gentleman.
Porsche cayman s = Perfect car!!
on a Monday morning here in Christchurch, New Zealand. Mat starts my week off with a smile. Legend!
Awesome. Lamb-baa sensor!
German or Japanese Thats my car mantra Porsche is awesome have a great day
✌🏻🇳🇱
I really admire you’re passion about re-built cars…..even I learn what’s parts are….keep up the good work……👍
Awesome vid Matt 👍
Fantastic result Matt looks and sounds awesome 🤟🤟
well that was a million time better than the spurs game......thanks Matt 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
Love your videos... But that lambda fault Is fake... If the plug wasn't connected, you would have a permanent fault there, and not stored/active...
You guys call lifts "ramps"? Weird.
whats with the mini picture
What a great video Matt, you really did a good job on that car. Porsche were hard but fair and they are hard people to please.
Uve now made the 718 Mat Armstrong edition Porsche which will be talked about more than the standard one. Uve given them free advertising so they are more pleased to see u than u might think.. well done Mat👍
Is there a upload schedule like how the sidemen have sidemen Sundays? I love these types of videos
👍😎
Well done Matt and the team, pleased for you.  Keep it up 😀
Always looking forward to your content Mat. Keep it up
ALMOST 1,000,000 SUBSCRIBERS! COME ON PEOPLE! 😃😃😃
LOVE FROM KENYA AFRICA IM 5000 LIKE
Great video bro ✌🏻👊🏻💨💨
Must admit I too am a new Porsche owner and when I went into Porsche at Towcester they were good as gold I get what u mean some dealers make u feel small then you turn on in or on their brand and they are totally different towards you keep up good work love the videos 🤟
That sun roof is mad!
Well done matt
Well done mate,what’s the name of the song you use at the end
Keep em coming. I love all these videos. Would be great if you started a series working on everyday normal cars, vauxhalls etc just to give guys like me a sense of direction.
Killed it 🖤
Someone like you... We are all customers.  You are a decent, hardworking guy. That is you. Only recently found your channel,  into bikes more than cars, but love a M5. Enjoying watching your back catalogue.
Never been a Porsche fan but I have fallen in love with that car.....can't wait to see it all 💯% and the paint job inspired...looks amazing!!
Aye, decent PR for Porsche. They should be paying you Mat!! 🎉
Genuinely, I was more anxious than Mat going through that after his brilliant work.
They respect you because your known and stacked lol
Loving it
The inspection is a very basic check Mat  is it not ?
❤️❤️❤️
the purple Porsche!!
It's a great car u saved from the scrap and made better, I really think porsche appreciate you saving one of the own from the scrap 👏👏👏 great viewing again thanks
This is my favourite car so far I think. There's something about these 718s that I really like, especially with the GT4 body-kit on. I also thought I'd say just how impressed I am with the feedback given by Porsche on it. Considering how wrecked it was, to have Porsche inspect it and give such positive feedback is amazing. Just highlights how much of an awesome job Mat has done on it.
Hannah is spot on. seen one porsche seen them all
Well done mate, that build turned out well 👌.. looking forward seeing the m5 comp moded 🔥☘
e … e … e …
Got to say that Porsche is sweet Mat. 7 out of 10 is automatic 8 out of 10 when you replace the under tray. Seat belt fix and the cable release connected your pushing a good 9 out of 10. In anyone's books that's a Gold Star. To match the colour lol. Well done mate nice one.
Good job! I'm not really a Porsche fan myself. I'm more of an Italian car kind of girl. 🇮🇹 Will you be giving this one away too? 🇺🇸
Fantastic stuff - nice to know how thoroughly Porsche does their inspections, pretty reassuring.  On a side note: anyone’s got digits of that Porsche Solihull girl? 😁
Cool vid.
Damn the color looks amazing
just around the corner from me ...should  a gave me a shout 🤭
They only treated you like that because of who you are and your youtube channel lol. After warranty I stay  away from stealerships!!!
Couldn't you buy it for less if you were the only bidder?
Porsche Solihull is good. Some others....not so much
Matt i hope u have all the success that u wish for with this channel, the content is the best out of all the car channels i follow. instant watch whenever u upload.
Just make my Sundays that little bit better 🎉
That purple Porsche is awesome
Every Sunday I’m always going to YouTube expecting a Mat Armstrong upload, and boom here he is back with another banger 🔥💥
FUCK YEEAH !!!
Congrats on all of your success and keep up the amazing work. Kudos to the technician also for being a stand up bloke and being honest about it all.  😊😊
A big thumbs up also to Josh. A real gentleman.
Congratulations on a job well done and approved by Porsche technicians.  I've always found the people at the local Porsche dealership to be quite friendly and helpful.  Why not? They all love the cars and they know that while I can't afford to buy a new 911 today, they know that the  day will come when we sit down to do the paperwork.
Incredible job and I agree with Hannah they all look the bleeding same! Tho I have to say they are growing in me. Much prefer the styling of the Gt4 👌
This guy has grown on me.. When I first startet watching I was like " what a tool". But now I really like him.. Cool guy and good vids..
Listen to Hannah. She is a lady of taste whose judgement should be respected. Why not get her a lovely Bentley, and then make it look classy like their cars of old? My 'TurboR's' standard interior walnut trim looked magnificent. I'd still have that car  if I had a large garage to keep off vandals. So much jealousy out there in the U.K!
7/10 pretty good, I love this car great episode Mat 🔥🔥🔥
I'm watching Mat instead of football (sorry the American version) lol BTW us Canadians never have frozen wiper issues but I felt your pain ;-)
Why did you go to Solihul rather than Leicester?  Is the 4 wheel alinement only done by Porche cant an independant like Tyres & Exhausts Galore, Leicester do it?
Cracking video again Mat, the staff at the dealership seemed really decent too!
Another fantastic Sunday video Matt
Absolutely wonderful! The efforts truly show with the affirmations from the tear down!
Matt, have you considered center gravity for your alignment/GEO? Not far from you either. I was there yesterday in my 981 GTS. They know their stuff, especially porsches.
Great work, keep it up.
Sensational stuff!!!😂❤❤❤👍
Hmm the Porsche or the Aston? Decisions, decisions  - brilliant and look at the number of subscribers!!
7/10 from Porsche but from us all you get 10/10!!!
Not just me then that feels like that when you go to the main dealer.
Porsche colchester essex are local to me. Me and my 7 year old often go in. The staff are so friendly with us.  They treat my lad lile a customer. He's always coming out with free things lile posters , books etc. They say , he's a potential future customer.
You know you're doing a good job when you're getting Bentley approval aswell as Porsche approval. Keep it up Matt. Top job.
The fact that the technician watches your video is amazing
By the way I guess you seen the white gt4 on Copart ????
Matt, do us a favour, pronounce Porsche properly. Pronounce it as Porsch-ah. Us Brits are terrible at saying it correctly.
Looks superb,! better than anything they had in the showroom 😆👍
They were pritty nice to you think you found a fan in tec guy
This car looks great 👍🏼 Next project a GT2 RS ;)
extra points for the magic flute at the end
Sweet video Mat! Good to see your hard work shows. Just seems like a few tweaks and you'll be getting a 10 rating in no time. Keep up the solid content brother
Well, I don’t think you’ve done Porsche sales any harm. Very professional inspection and plain down to earth friendly.
Finally, uppload! 😂
Another phenomenal video! I really enjoyed the trip to Porsche!  I still can't wait to see the murcielago run!
Porche man great
Never been to a showroom where i felt i did not belong, they way i see it they have not idea if you could afford to buy one or not.
This guy is a professional in his work big up
I love your Porsche you have done an awesome job with it. Another Great Video by Matt. Keeping them coming please
Great job on that Porsche Mat..one of my fav videos of your rebuilds.. And thanks Porsche for the virtual visit in your inspection room- so neat and tidy, just WOW
love you man.
Another one 🙂
Man in a garage against multi billion pound company. Amazing effort, quality entertainment. Keep up the great work!
damn I will miss the car
@ Mat Armstrong: Hi Mat, it would be great if you could make an introduction of the modified exhaust system on your Cayman and also show how it sounds under differnt conditions.  Saw just one short vid. part of welding and instalation but the soundcheck in the workshop was not representing how it sounds outside. Thank's
52k views in 42 min. Killing it.
Almost at a million dude!!  Get subbing folks!!
steering wheel is in pristine condition ! as new.
When’s it going up for sale? 🙂 I wanna buy it!
Nothing like your other half keeping your feet on the ground! “Your no gentleman”,😀
I would love to see a video of you buying a crashed and damaged Honda or Fiat and do it up!!
Congratulations on a great build! Love your channel. I'm  from South-Africa but work on a farm in Stafford.
guys how do you guys do find it so easy to say "wiper mo'o.....the seconds later its wiper motor" lmao🤣🤣🤣🤣
6:41min get the Plastic right :-)
No lie... I'm a HUGE Audi fan and the gen 1 R8 is my dream car but this rebuild has been my favourite rebuild you've done this far 🥺❤️🤤 the way I would love to own a porsche cayman
I need the outro song, cant find it anywhere >:(
Absolutely throwin down here in Amsterdam. Gloomy and miserable. Wait, what? Mats uploaded a new video? Happy days  😃
❤❤❤
Sunday's my favorite day for an upload and this Porsche is definitely one of my favorite rebuilds 💛
Does this count as an MOT then ?
God, I fucking love your vids mat. Always excited to watch what you’re at
Our Porsche is the only car I have the dealer work on, otherwise, we do stuff on our own for the truck. Your experience is just like what we have at our dealer. It does seem like they actually care and they're genuinely nice.
Love the colour of your Porsche it’s banging! Great work to the car too and only minor points raised following a Porsche inspection is a fabulous result and a credit to your workmanship. Keep the videos coming Mat, they’re great! 😊
Today is a good day. A new Mat Armstrong video. Best day for sure to get this content
Looks absolutely awesome man
Glad your doing that under tray
Could you do an infiniti of the sorts? Maybe a G series and use it for a drift car???
Another great vid, you and us viewers were so lucky they allowed you to film during the inspection.
🔥🔥🔥👏
thats a nice porsche
Josh seemed to be pretty chill! Nice!
Looks awesome.
No one segues into an AD as smoothly as you Mat! I actually watch your ads (fast forward all others). Josh was very cool at Porsche👍👍👍
Another great watch Matt, keep up the good work. Can see your energy and enthusiasm is inspiring many
Yes she's done
Solihull uno you was around the corner from me lol
what a great and enjoyable video Mat, nice one fella
Job well done matt💪
Sometimes I just sit here pressing refresh waiting for a new mat Armstrong video 🙂
Enjoying these videos 😁🔥 great job mat 👌
it looks soo good !
Lamba 💀
Looks great. But I wouldn’t want to drive it. I’ve seen how it’s been repaired.
And every Sunday Matt dropped a video.
looking to go 718 when it's time to change the G83 Beema was contemplating going 8 series convertable next but think I'll possibly go 718 boxter . 🤔🤔
Im surprised! That’s amazing how they rated it so high! Keep up the amazing work!
Every time, Every vid you guys make me smile ear to ear.. Well done guys 😁
Truly amazing build, loved every minute of it. You really took it to the next level with this one Mat, those wheels are absolutely sick! 👍🏼
😎
This car in this colour is so good, never been a Porsche fan, but this looks the part 👌 great effort
She is right they all look the same.

Killing it Matt ! Much love from 🇦🇺🦘
Porsche can you fix my Gearbox pleaseeeeeeeee :), its like fully dead now
No you don't want hit by an air bag I'd know as I was hit by one last February when my car was totaled in a wreck and I had lot of healing to do after the wreck.
Good work on the 7/10 rating Mat 👍🏻😎 this has been my favourite build so far because of the huge undertaking of it all, keep it up mate, you’re smashing it
Thing is. This Porsche lad couldn’t have done what Matt has done on this car.
Hy Mat Would you rebuild an AMG G63
Nearly on a million subscribers now fella, it will be awesome when you do hit the million.
Nearly there,Great work and a nice car .
Cant wait for the Roadtrip! A Top Speed run in the Cayman would be 🔥
considering it was a beaten up pile of junk awesome job Matt
Porsche did the 4 wheel geometry set up on my car and the difference was night and day.  They treat me really well and aren't up themselves. As ever Mat another great episode. Keep it up mate HWBT all day long!
Doing something special when you Hit the million,, road Trip,,
Can not wait till this one is up to win! 🤞 defo be entering
Can’t believe you’re so close to 1 million subscribers already. Fair play man. ❤
At this point, there is no where you don't belong in the car scene💯❤ I swear watching your videos gives me the courage to try again tomorrow.
Awesome content for the masses. Well done pal. Keep em coming and live that dream for all of us. 🚗👍🏻
Massive respect to Porsche!
Car looks spot on, stick some front plates on it though!
Mat , are you aware of the Goonzquad Porsche rebuild ?.
Great video as always Mat! Very good initial rating from Porsche I’m sure you can get it to a 9/10 with the other tweaks needed mate 👍🏻
This is the best channel on you tube mate. And your so down to earth love your stuff mate
Am i the only one that takes this channel seriously..? It appears to me as a series.. Keep up with the good job Matt👍🏼
Amazing build as always Mat you are my fave YouTube channel by a mile :)   Are you planning on selling the blacked out tool set again?  😁😁
i think its time for a 911 turbo s now mat .
Some change in that car unbelievable job 👍
This car is just stunning another great video
Main dealers always take the p***s a bit ignore them you do a great job!
Don’t be harsh with people you work with! You never know wen you need them again 😅😅
When is there going to be a Lamborghini video
Totally with Hannah about them all looking the same 🤣
Nearly at a million Matt… 😊😊
wicked video,
Porsche South London sold me a 2018 Macan S (18 months old) with a resprayed rear passenger door in a lighter colour. I had to pay to respray- wasn’t noticeable at first. Then Porsche South London sold me a 2019 (12 months old) 911 992 S with a conoralised passenger dashboard I only noticed after buying. Porsche used vehicles are a potential money pit. I don’t trust Porsche U.K. with their used cars who knows what has happened to them. Porsche dealers stick £7k to £10k on each used car and don’t give a shit. My next car will be a brand new Macan GTS from Porsche Mayfair
Hey mat, exact thing happend with us with the seatbelt tensioner thing, we went to the airbag team which I'm assuming is what you done too, same fault came up, they told us the exact thing. We ended up sending it back and they fixed it. Don't think this is a one off.
Aston Martin is a true gentleman's car. Porcha in't ! 🙂
Do a test with your friends and let them find out which car had a collision, compared to the cars that are still original.
Not a massive fan of Porsche’s. But I love this build and really want one!
Lamb Da
