I’m just surprised that they haven’t made popcorn on the hob before
My fave videos ever to watch are your holiday vlogs😫😫 so sad this is the last one!! You’re the reason I vlogged my trip to Portugal! So surreal I was vlogging in the exact same place as syd and ell. You girls are my inspiration🥰❤️✨ I literally sat at the table at the wolf next to the fountain😂❤️ I called it a fountain in my vlog too but it’s a waterfall😭🤣
Syd has definitely had her hairline done
Love this vlog girls! Gave me the holiday vibes! X
Is it just me that thinks Moll’s dad is a great singer? 😂
Loved all of your holiday vlogs💞💞
