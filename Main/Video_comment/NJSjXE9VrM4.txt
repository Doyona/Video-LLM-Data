That 149 checkout
IDK, I don’t like any one player dominating a sport.  Wasn’t fond of MVG when he couldn’t miss.  It looks like Littler will dominate for years.  At least Phil T was older, so you rooted for the older great player.  Essentially at this point you watch to see who comes in third.
First darts match I ever watched
Once Luke Humphrey got playing night after night closer together it was the best Luke Humphreys and he wasn't going down
For me that was the final rob cross v luke littler . Humphries is so boring even a snail has a better personality
To be fair it would’ve been a better Story if littler had won it. Sort of an anti climax the other guy winning it.
8:57   9:05  9:17     15:37     19:54     20:56    22:12    26:07    26:55    27:49    29:25    30:35
A double Bull 132 out is just so satisfying 😮
Has there been a 9 darter this tournament? Was just thinking, and must have missed it if there had been!
Tf is this
Bye f Williams
So Luke Littler, tell us how you perfected your throw……..Pretty easy really, I just copied Michael van Gerwens throw!!
Use the force Luke...
The world number one will live up to his name tonight
Both don't do what the experts  promote that's why they're in this final. Both thragg well but the hump does it better.
lose some weight
Rob Cross always a class act
Hope Luke wins the final....
Dartja vu, ill never unhear that 😖
I'm a 100% convinced LUKE is going to win the final this year!!!
Humphries is the winner of the tournament
Littler got this easy😂😂
Humphries will win the final for sure
These commentators the worst i have ever heard.
One thing's for sure though, Luke is going to win the World Championship.
Good luck to Luke in the Luke v Luke final
Look at all the geniuses in the comments noticing the finalists have the same first name, well done! *Seal clap*
LUKE VS LUKE IN THE MOST LUKED FINAL THAT HAS EVER LUKED!! WHO WILL OUT LUKE THE OTHER LUKE IN THE BATTLE OF THE MOST LUKIEST LUKE!!!!!
16 years old where ? Fella looks minimum 25 with full facial hair aint no one fooling me
Anyone know the bit of music before ad break on sky coverage sounds like "it's a call of the wild it's a fight to survive" it's not everytime probably 1 in 3-4 breaks
Luke will win the final for sure  😉
can i watch final live on utube ?????
That's not even a sport. Only British get excited about darts.
Jeśli jest tu jakiś Polak to niech da łapkę w górę
Dari planet mana manusia ini muncul..?
Great. A guy with zero personality and a 16 year old who looks 35. Can't wait.
One thing is for sure, Luke is gonna win the championships 😂
The 28 year old was awesome, when he beat the 43 year old Chizzy then celebrated at his pub with a pint from Dave the Barman aged 37.
There will be nothing Lukewarm about this Final!
Humphries doesn't look beatable in that form, not even by Littler who has been amazing
Use the Force, Luke.
I'm predicting is Luke is going to win the championship
A Luke Vs Luke final aye? Well, my money is on Luke to win 👍
Luke..... I'm not your father!
Wow, there are a lot of really poor jokes with named an StarWars quotes in this comment section.🙈
Will this channel be broadcasting the Live Final  Match ?
It's going to be the best ever grand final for both Luke's, good luck guys 👍
I thought cross was gonna blow him 😂
Williams seems to have lost his swagger
Great Darts. Terrible repetitive crowd chants.  Same every year 😅😅😅😅😅
Things are Luke’n good 💪🏼
he's 16??? someone check his birth certificate 😂😂😂
Luke Littler is too cold
I'm 100% sure LUKE will win this Championship!
If Cross stopped himself from pausing after most throws he would be very good im sure this effects his accuracy and definitely effects his flow. How many times does he hit treble 20 to pause throw and hit single 20. On the 9 darter after hitting 180/180 he then decided to start on treble 19 ? I dont understand his thinking why wouldn't you start on treble 20 considering he just hit 6 in a row.  How scott beat MVG is just mind boggling 😲 Had a feeling Humphries would bully him. Going to be a very good final Luke Humphries is going to take some stopping 18 games unbeaten plus He's recently won 2 finals. Its going to be some final, I hope Littler wins it because he has had so much pressure put on him which he seems to be handling well.
It’s the Luke show come on littler 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
GREAT BRITISH DARTS
I hope luke wins the final
I don't see Humphries losing. Absolutely incredible stuff 👏
Luke ll beat him, be a tough n tho. ? Of course
England won!!
If littler is 16, Cross must be 0 years old. 💘
Littler,  little Luke,  will win tonight. Humphries will start missing his doubles as Littler will keep him pressuring all the time like in the two matches he almost lost.  Littler demolished all his competitors.
I predict the noisiest final ever, Luke has so got the crowd behind him. Good luck lad
MAY the FORCE be with you LUKES SKYWALKERS both of yous 😂😂😂😂😂
Fun fact.....a luke will be World Master
Highlights??? Admittedly Luke's 2 140+ check-outs & Robs 138(in 1st 5sets)are good but also lots of missed doubles(obviously gonna win 4 sets in row but this certainly not a classic-like Eric B loosing to Keith D.....1 hit wonder)🤔🤔
The Max Verstappen of darts.
Humphries to win 100%..  And NO WAY is Littler 16!!!!!!!😂😂!
I bet Luke will be World Champion!
Nice to see this kind of sportsmanship in professional sports. Congragts to the Lukes, but both opponents did take it really well. Good look for all of them!  Let's enjoy a very interesting final!
LOL 16  years old is only a number he actually looks about 50, may be even more LOL. His body clock is ticking down FAST,
Humphries is a icky bloke. Be good to see either one of the finalists get a thrashing from their rival. Just to put the boot on the other foot and bring them back to earth. 😂
Undeserved for luke littler. Faking your age for media coverage is not cool.. go luke humphries! Crush that one trick pony.
These 2 Lukes are superb players. Going to be a top class final
It's good that lost 6:0.  Darts is not a place for the arrogant... A champion must be someone to admire.
Rob Cross always stops his momentum on crucial darts. Sport is all about momentum and riding these waves. Yet whenever he is in a flow, he purposely stops himself and invariably misses. Does he not understand this most simple of concepts? He'd be an even better darts player if he played more fluently
rob cross got rob crossed ..... simple .....
Shame on you MvG shame on you…… embarassment of the year to lose against a very very mediocre player… I did not have any doubt that Luke would destroy him without any adversity… to bad the bookies ods were not higher
Humphries the best darter alive
Litler, 36 years old.
"the force is strong in this one "
He's so consistent against some of the best players in the world. It's scary to think he's only going to get better
Is Humphries number one now
THERE’S ONLY ONE LUKE LITTLER! 🎉
Luke Littler the new messi that number 10 magic
My money is on Luke to win
Humphries will eat him alive   End of discussion
Couldn’t hope for a better final these two are something else just glad cross and Williams didn’t get through I think that would of been a more boring final 😊
Humphries is was definitely more clinical than Littler. I think there's a chance it could go down to the wire in the final.
There are signs that Luke Littler will struggle if he's not in front.
Luke is looking unstoppable, he’s playing great darts and finishing here.
does anyone know Humphries's checkout %?
Your not so cocky now are you Williams you daft prat?
Lukes 16 going on 37
Didn’t know that Greg Wallace was commenting on the darts
I don't think Littler was as clinical as he has been in the tournament so far. Maybe the occasion of the final may affect Littler?
Cross might be good, but his throw is horrible.
Bet that give williams heartburn
With all the sadness that's going on in the world at present, we need something to distract us from all that's happening. Luke Littler is surely an inspiration to all of us. Let's hope he has his moment of glory ~ hey and even if not, he will undoubtedly rise to World Champion in the near future as his skills become even more masterful...
Luke Littler put on an amazing performance at such a young age. Before the Rob Cross fight I somehow didn't believe in him, which makes me sad now. Now that he's beaten Rob Cross, who also has his qualities, Luke Littler also has a chance to beat another Luke. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for him in the finals. He deserves to win because his game makes darts an interesting sport.
“He’s the best player in the world. Don’t worry about anyone else”. Love it
Wow, this kid looks like he's had a hard life to look like a 30yr old.
2023 final Michael vs Michael  2024 Luke vs Luke
132 check out simply the dogs danglies 👌🏼👌🏼
How well has Luke Littler done this tournament, WOW!
Can Luke Littler do what Keith Deller did back in 1983? I believe he can!!!
incredible darts, an onslaught by LL, constant pressure. Will be some final
Cross is a better player then Williams. If Cross plays vs humphries it would be 6-3 for Humphries. If Littler plays vs Williams it would be 6-0. So if you imagine you think Littler is gonna win the final.
7-4 Littler.
Congratz to both Lukes! Can't wait to watch the final!
Scott deserves the defeat. He is an arrogant Arse.
Williams myslel si že prorazí tou svojí arogancí.
I'll be rooting for luke in the final!
Luke Humphries is so boring and bland. hope the other Luke wins, it will be best for darts
Mate Luke has this in the bag! Good luck to him 🎯
I threw the 🏠 on Littler.  I have a backup tent ⛺️ 😅
Class from Cross at the end
Williams is embarrassingly bad
Scott Williams, what arrogant prick for someone who has won nothing, and even this white wash probably won't humble him into realising he is Meh, and only beating people who aren't playing well. What a Final to come though, some real quality from both Lukes.
that kid is going places
Littler m'a juste impressionné depuis le début de la competition. Le mec est hyper jeune et à une telle maturité c'est impressionnant. Il a dérouler devant cross et malgré la victoire beaucoup de respect pour son adversaire comparer a beaucoup de joueurs qui crie et saute partout  ... Futur légende 👍
Cross simply missed way to many outs!
How can I watch this I live in America. Is their a site I can stream ur illegally
Fluke vs Luke
Who's on the left side that they all get angry at
Littler will win
It's certain that Luke would win the world championship
Great respect to littler and cross, they played a nice game of darts🌍🙏🏼✨✨✨✨
Wow the final should be top draw darts
Should be a great final. Cross does himself no favours when he stops and pauses. No rhythm.
i wanna both on nines tomorrow but someone hits it the first time!
May be 16 but looks 30 plus, i was surprised Rob reached this far he hasnt been at his best unlike Littler been out standing i do find it wrong to call him a kid mind he has left school and working for a living, any person that does that is an adult best of darts for the final Lukes
Littler is freaking incredible. I got goosebumps after that 132. DOMINANT performance.
He play very good and eat very good. 👍🤣
I dont think luke humphires stands a chance aganist Luke littler
A lot to luke forward to in this match.
Lukebowl 2024
I know Gillette is not a sponsor but anyhow great show WOW. Luke Humphreys has been working so hard for this for sure and then the Kid  WOW what a story
Littler 106.0 average and a whopping 47% on the doubles, Humphries 108.7 average and an amazing 60% checkout rate. We haven't seen semis of this quality in a few years.
Why does the cover of the video spoils the winners? Can't you just keep it for these that couldn't watched it live...
Humphries is maybe the one and only dartsman who have the waist and quite slim. The other players are freaky fat without their waist, too fcking fat! It's disgusting! If you look at the snooker players or cyclists there are no such shit!
Sad for Cross as he is my favorite player but well deserved for Littler. I'm hoping for an epic finale and that not a single Luke underperforms
Anyone else think it’s creepy his mrs so much older? Other way around the bloke would be getting slaughtered
If humphries is able to perform like that again in the final littler wont stand a chance. Humphries played ljke a robot. 108 average, 60% doubles, insane
16 year old with a full beard? No kid in my high school had a full beard, as far as I can remember
18:54 I wish the drooling commentators would stop drooling all over one player when the other player has a shot out. "Treble-ten, double-ten" wasn't what Rob was going for.  19:05 "Could he possibly, in a world semi-final, go treble-ten, double-ten".. but Luke didn't, making that tit look like a tit. When Luke checked-out double-16, the guy was more concerned about his 'prediction' than lauding Luke's win. Jeez. Well-played, young Luke.
2 Lukes 1 cup
No big power house players played eachother.
If you‘re not rooting for littler in the final idk whats wrong with you….
The world final commentary would be like... Pyke: Luke Humphries isn't in any mood to give him a sniff. Mardle: Yeah, the compination finishing in this game is gonna be key. You can tell by the way they're scoring, they maybe nothing in it. They may be both on nines. Luke may miss and Luke may hit! They're both on nines! They're both on a nine.This is insane! Come on now. Pyke:Wow! The world championship final Luke Humphries, is on a nine darter, in the world final just misses double twelve over to you Luke Littler. Mardle: One man misses does the other man get I have never seen the like, Come ons Littler, yes double twelve. That's the most amazing leg of darts you will ever see in your life. I can't spake! I can't spake! Pyke: Absolutely unbelievable. The crowd are going berserk, Luke Littler makes more history in the world final. That's simply the best leg of darts Ever! Ever! Ever!
Lovely to see a hobby for the grandelders. They seem well fed aswell! It's amazing there are tables providing fluid (Beer). Without KFC-food and beer this "sport" is impossible to do!
I watched it live and in the highlights the first match seems boring compared to the real match. The scoring was crazy good. First 180 in the highlights was the 15th in the match already
Should be a cracking final. I'm giving the nod to Luke H because I don't think Luke L will get in head easily even if he gets two legs up early
Only one Luke is winner.
Cross always hesitates after a shot even when he’s on track feel like it ruins his rhythm
Bare in mind when rob beat phill in the final 2018 he had nerve of steel and now that’s luke
IM CERTAIN WITH OUT A DOUBT LUKE WILL WIN
Humphries is unstoppable. No fairy tale ending for Littler.
What a final this is gonna be epic. A bit of Luke on Luke action  Fair play to Scott Williams as well. If he plays like this he'll most definitely get a big trophy
Humphries will win comfortably. By 3 clear sets
Couldn’t in my wildest dreams predict the final tonight, my heart says Littler for the ultimate Fairytale ending/Cinderella story but my head says Humphries simply from the quality of the darts he’s produced from the QF onwards and his consistency of nailing the big checkouts. I’d honestly be happy for either of these two to win! Go on lads, give us a darts match to remember!
Can't help feeling like this is the death of darts. Who's worse when they're 30 than they were at 16?? Seems like the future of darts is going to be about the also rans.
As a Humphries fan i find myself conflicted! I so want to see this kid Littler win and smash darts records? But also dont want the one i have my money on to lose!
Where are those who said mvg or anderson or even price will be in the finals??? They even had the guts to not include humphries whose on a champion streak...good thing i bet on Luke...now i got sure win since Luke will be the name of the new world champ 😂😂
Has Humphries peaked too soon in his semi? 🤔🤔🤔. Whoever wins will deserve it as to win it they will have to set a very high standard as both these 2 are on fire
Fantastic darts!   Incredible.  I cannot wait to see the Final.  I anticipate spectacular.   Thank you for the great coverage.  This tournament has been incredible entertainment.  (I’m in US)
world number one vs world number WAIT who let this kid on the stage? hahaha congratulations to both of you. This is going to be a great final.
Go on Cool Hand win this Championship!!
We all knew this was coming , a final nobody cares about , because we are not in it . But we will be back for sure . It doesnt matter how , but we will send even more guys next year , to improve the odds . If players need marry some Swedish woman to qualify by the Scandinavian tour , so be it , but we will not stop there , you will see Dutch players next year in the Asian tour , Australia , Canada . As 12 entries proved to be insufficient , next year at least 24 Dutch players . Dirk will be back . Nationwide search has been started already for some decent players named Luke , Luuk , or Loek , and we confident we find someone , this as some extra insurance we wont look like a bunch of fools next year .
Nice win for Littler, but you can clearly see he is getting old. It is time for him to let younger players win.
Dream Final 🙌🏻
I couldn't ask for a better final. I am happy whoever wins. I really think Luke has got this wrapped up. Too good at scoring and finishing.
“Luke .... I am your Father!”😂😂😂 if Humphries beats Littler!
Good to see someone put Williams in his place
So happy for Scott to make it this far. Would have loved him in the finals, but still, considering he's had a rather down year it's a huge boon to his ranking and career.
Early in the match, I think maybe the second, possibly third set, Littler looked frustrated for the first time in the entire tournament. It was the first time he was losing, and he was down in the set as well, and after a bad visit was shaking his head at himself. It was the first time he's looked under pressure, and I was curious how he'd react.  He came back with three nearly perfect visits to win that leg, then won consecutive legs for the set and sailed away to a huge lead. That told me the last bit I needed to know about him. The only thing he hadn't shown in this tournament - because he he hadn't had to - was if he could come back from adversity.  I don't know if he'll win tomorrow, Humphries is playing amazingly as well, but after today I see no reason why Littler can't.
He's got the hair right.
Shame his parents didn't have a sense of humour and called him Adolf.😂😂
Trebles for show, doubles for dough 🤩🤩🤩
Cross needs to change his game , stopping after he throws all the time is stupid
At least that massive clown of Scott Williams is out.
Humphries on a different level tonight.Awesome.
I think Luke will win
Littler is my second favorite sixteen year old badass. Check out Canaan Bower. It's not a darts story but this kid is a legend. Well played gentlemen.
Funfact he isnt 16 hes 36
100% A Guy Called Luke or Young Lad Teenager Called Luke Will Win The Darts World Championships At Alexander palace 2023/2024 🎯🏆❤👍👍Next Up The Snooker Masters At The Alexander Palace 2024 🎱🏆🚀🐐👑📿🙄🦁❤👍👍
I just came for 170 Checkout from littler and its not in 🤢🤢🤢
Good luck Luke Humphries MOT
Littler is a straight up killer, no fear in the young man, will likely dominate for the next 25 years
I hope Luke wins , because Luke is about as animated as a mannequin.
The way Humphries checked out all these high finishes was just brutal.
Finals going to be madness i was thinking  littler  to win but wattching  humphries i dont know its like dart boxing the last game arms get tired
a Canadian will be crowned champion.
Never seen anybody play the way this kid does. New ronnie o’Sullivan of darts!
The Usain Bolt analogy had me in stitches! Jeez, the comedy.
Amazing darts!  Final is going to be fun to watch!
Luke v Luke for the title 😁
Not even a fan of darts but Luke littlers story has got me hooked on darts 😂
Feels so weird to not have an OG in the final.
Got up this morning at 2.30 am to watch a boring football match , went back to bed with 15 minutes remaining  as I knew instinctively there wouldn't be a goal.  Can only watch the highlights of this sporting spectacle , an exhibition of supreme skill.
Luke will win tomorrow
Littler is a brilliant darts player , sometimes Humphries looks like he's from a different planet . I predict a win for humphries but its not going to be easy Littler is a machine .
8:29 cold 🥶🥶
If they both keep up this standard, it'll be the best Final in recent memory.
Battle of the Lukes for the final - who saw this coming when Humphries been sweeping the trophies and Littler only just became Youth Champ!!
Humphries got that luck of the champion just like Smith had last year.  Should've been out against Pikachu and Cullen but they both choked.   Anyway I hope Littler wins it ,  will go down in the history books if he makes it.   And imo he deserves it more than Humphries , because Littler had been consistent in all matches and Humphries like I said should've already been eliminated.
this is definitely the world championship of the newbies :D
Rob cross is the reason I can’t pay for my karate lessons this month. Can’t bet on him anymore
It will come down to pressure and who handles it best. Humphries lukes like he could just handle it better,but littler could surprise us. Hope its a close final and best of luke to both. Thanks for the uploading btw great job, but can i please ask uploader not to give result away. Thanks again
Which Luke will have the coolest hand?
One thing is certain, its goodbye to the Old Guard and hello to the New.
One thing for sure, Luke will win it
Are we going to get full match uploads
Littler, at age 16 and assuming he is not drinking, he needs to cut down on his burgers n fries.
I find it absolutely stunning how Littler at some point in the match just turns a button in his head/body, and he starts to absolutely demolish his opponent. He plays somewhat even with his opponent for a certain time, and then just absolutely plows his opponent. Insane darts.  Humphries was absolutely phenomenal as well, Williams never had an answer and it is not even 'bad' that he hadn't. Humphries with his best match was just too much for Williams.  It has been an insane World Championship this year, what a way to end 2023 and go into 2024! I am very very excited for the final this evening, it will be an absolute classic if both finalists are on their A-game, just like the whole tournament. May the best man win, but I will root for Littler a little bit more ;)
Clearly I’ll be rooting for Luke in the final 😁 Looks like a cracker though I expect it to be a little nervy early doors with two first time finalists.
Feel for scott but he had a great run, luke is just on another level, should be a great final
I'll bet for luke...😂😂😅
Man I like Williams, I didn’t think he was going to win, but damn Humphries handed his ass to him! Lol
Its going to be a cracker
Humphries is like an automaton with that glazed look on his face when he throws. So accurate.
36 left and Littler went for 16, D10 haha. I've never seen that before.
To be honest, I can't see Luke losing the final.
The Pretty Girls will be Chasing him All the way to the Bank..Lol...Good to see this Kid win as he is so humble & so over Mature in hes nature for a 16 year old, and lets just hope he has good people around him as fame could break you at a young age with bad management... Go Littler Go...
Thank God for Darts .. 😂😊❤  Xx
Humphries is a beast. Can't see him losing unless he loses his head or Littler suffers from nerves.
Humphries is throwing out of his mind, and I think he's going to win it, but I hope Littler pushes him all the way. 7-5 Humphries, but not as close as it looks
This Luke guy is insanely good
Luke littler looks older then Rob Cross 😂😂😂
so pleased my man luke humphries gave scott williams a good hidding, strutting around the stage like some bad boy whos been doing it for years the clown  booooom😅
120 average? What the.... 😮
Can’t wait for the final. Could easily see Humphries ending the Littler fairytale and not following the script the press are hyping up, but who knows. Hope for a cracking final, 7-6 or 7-5 whichever way round it goes would be great. Don’t want the darts the end so the more we get the better!
That 132 Checkout 💥
please, with the fast throwers like Luke, stop cutting to their face all the time, when cutting back to the board the dart often already hit the board plus these very fast cuts are super stressful and annoying
Cool Hand Luke will arise tomorrow! It will be a Lukathon finale!!! All the best... Go get em Luke.
Litller looks adult already,hes face and body dont look like 16 years old.
Well all South Africa needs is Italy to stand for the Christian Churches destroyed and Christians Murdered by Snipers and Ireland to show the Murder of Journalists Bombing of Hospitals killing any emergency health workers and rescue workers. Stopping food clean water from going in to Gaza as miles of Lorries trying to go there with medical food water aid. All of that is Genocide by the definition of the word. Just like Hitler did every single thing Israel is doing is Genocide even when they speak sounds like Hitler.
Heil Littler! No Fluke Luke! I like both Luke's so i am happy whomever wins the title.
Littler-next phil taylor
Bristow would be proud of Litler
19:27 highlight of the day
Luke could play the next 6 years and still be the youngest champ we have ever seen ! Does he miss ? I think we are watching a guy that makes mvg nervous ! Put it into context he can only just buy red bull from the shop ! Get him a sponsorship from red bull hahaha
Para mi los mejores del torneo han sido, Littler, Humphries, M Van Gerwen, Dolan, Dobey, Rob Cross, y Bunting.
And everyone rejoices that Scott Williams was thrashed. A well-deserved result for him.
Betting the house on Luke to win it tomorrow 😂😂
both lukes well done i'll be rooting for humphries as i tuned in for the littler round of 16 and stayed for humphries vs cullen and that comeback was insane
Y vaya paliza le ha pegado Humphries a Scott Williams. Va a ser buena esta final tambien. Lucky Luke!!
What a final it's going to be
come on luke haha i live only a couple of miles away from st helens darts shop, the buzz around here for tomorrow is brilliant
Seriously ..stop ruining the result in the thumbnail
Luke is looking great and Luke looks hard to beat.  Luke will have to start fast otherwise Luke will dominate and then Luke will be in trouble.  So glad to see Luke playing so well but I wouldn't mind if Luke won.  My moneys probably on Luke but Luke may nick it.  Good luck Luke.
Littler looks and plays like someone twice his age.
It's a big difference between being a big scorer compared to finishing you can score all you want but if you can't finish you can't win lol
Right, stop the crap Luke Jokes ., and get on with a great final. 😊
16 year old more like 30 year old needs to be drug tested probably on some testosterone looking like that 😂
Said after the quarter finals, Humphries is back favourite again.   Really hope he drops to his vs Chisnall level and we get an amazing final. Or even better Littler just does the unthinkable and matches him on 110 averages.
The jump Humphries made in the Cullen match was evident.   No stopping him since.
Nah Littler is actually unreal 😭😭
Just class he is the best dart player I've ever seen and IAM 62 John lowe Erick Bristow no one can catch him
Use the force, Luke.
Littler is the player Josh Rock isn’t. Amazing to see, well done 👌
From Bilbao, Spain: Sir Luke, The Little (for young), Double LL.... QUE PARTIDAZO. Cross ha jugado bien, pero es que LL es una pasada. La final deberia haber sido LL contra M Van Gerwen fuerte. Hubiera sido la hostia. Grande Luke
Lukes like it's gonna be a great final and I'm so glad I've witnessed another genius in my lifetime.
Who wants to bet that Luke wins tomorrow?
Who ever wins will deserve it because they have both fought to get to the final👍
Luke's got right now what separates life's winners and losers. BOTTLE! He reminds me of Eric Bristow when he was younger, oozes confidence.
where's the show boating wil-yums🤣👍✌️
I'm willing to adopt  either Luke  win or lose
I hope Luke wins the final.
Hes a phenomenal talent (littler) he deserves to go far on what's going to be a stellar career
Littler for the trophy.
Cross was playing rather well, averaging a smidge over 102, but when your opponent is just blitzing you with ton+ finish after ton+ finish, there is simply nothing you can do to counter it.
It would be awesome great to let us watch the highlights without the fuckin spoiler thimbnail.. fuk!
Fantastic stuff ! Seen nothing like it !
When the legs are at 2-2 just show the whole leg please!
Lets just take a moment to laugh at chris dobey 😂
Come on Luke Humphries will be smashing final 🎯 tomorrow keep fighting 🤍💛💙👊✊
Good to see someone else will win their first world title. I called it yesterday that the 2 Luke's would get in
My money's on Luke to win it this year.
Here we go everyone. Luke vs Luke in the final. It's going to be epic. I really like Luke Humphries, but I'm rooting for the 16 year old to make history. I think we may be seeing the Ronnie O'Sullivan of darts and perhaps even the next Phil Taylor emerging. Come on young man you can do it!!!
Shame really no respect given to the favourite and paid the price 😂. Still all fantastic matches.
I said since november that Luke Humphries would become world champion. And since Littler beat Barney, i knew what the final would be
Humphries will beat littler, he just too good and consistent, hell of a player.
Littler won’t beat Humphries, but what a run he’s had. If MVG doesn’t step up Humphries could well go on to dominate, littler also
Who thinks Luke will win the world championship ?
Impressive displays by both Lukes. Hope they can maintain this level and give us a great exciting final. May the best Luke win!
Qué exhibición de Luke Littler. Es impresionante verle jugar. Qué definición.
Congrats Luke, PDC 2024 Champ.
I've got my money on "luke" to win .
Vamos a ver. Estoy viendo la primera y esperada semifinal con la revelacion Luke Littler. Pongo este comentario con el 1-1 en set y 0-1 en legs. Es una pasada este chico (Luke Littler). Es impresionante. Es increible. Emociona verle jugar. Vamos a ver, en este torneo son todos buenisimos, pero lo de este chico (LL) es especial, tiene don. Aupa Luke
A final where I dont care who wins . . . a great year for darts
Cross is just his own worst enemy. Every time he has 3 darts he stops touches his leg abd then throws its just weird he never has any rhythm. Just throw your pissing darts hes so annoying
that was surely littlers most impressive win so far. I kept on telling people not to get to hyped about him and thought he wont be able to beat one on the top top players in such a long format and here I am looking absolutely stubborn. Well done lad, unbelievable game against a brilliant cross
I can’t call this final… all I know is a guy named Luke will win😂
Here’s Lukeing at you Luke. What a final is in store. Humphries to shade it and cap off the best 6 months of his life. Hope they asked MVG whether Humphries is allowed to be Number 1. 😀
both of Luke's finishing is sublime
Unbelievable stuff from Littler tonight! And somehow, Humphries played even better!  Well done to Cross and Williams, both did really well to get to the semi's. What a final it's going to be! Honestly don't mind if Littler or Humphries wins, all I know is it's going to be a crazy match
If they don't throw the 9-dart tomorrow, I will be surprised.
Littler is gonna destroy Humphries , mark my words
I’m from the future. Humphries wins the final 7-4.
a pitx not to see MVG against Humpries in the semi this match was so annoying
Littler will hammer humphries we are in for a one sided final
I wish that they would play just like they did today. Averages over 105 and this will be fire!
16 ahahahhahahhah a covid is real to clowns
I can't believe what I'm watching
Luke is one hell of a player I just hope he doesn’t go the wrong way with all the fame and stays on the right track in his life of being a super darts player 😊
it is not interesting to see humpries anymore  when he is so dominating like this...i hope he doen't win to easy against littler
Humphriss will win 7-4
200 k Guarantee if littler loses
This could be the best final ever... both are in their peak... wait littler is 16😮 Can't wait for a match against mvg/smith/price when they have a streak.
Part kept calling humpries williams
Who will be the "lucky" Luke tomorrow?
Grant Mitchell (the Queen Victoria) v Tyrone Dobbs (the Rovers Return Inn)
“LUKE LUKE LUKE LUKE LUKE LUKE LUKE LUKE LUKE LUKE”
Shame MVG Pooed his pants. Probably would’ve made for a better semi.
5 days ago I said what if LL gets to the final and batters Van dope Gurwen?...everyone laughed, well, Homer is long gone on the bus home with all the other "Van" flops by now...and LL is in the final, well I never🤣
Wow, both the Semi final performances reminded me of Prime Mvg and Anderson in 2016/17 and the averages showed that. Its all set up to be an amazing world final.
2 incredible performances so hard not to be very excited tomorrow's final. Doesn't mean it will be an epic because if one of them is a bit off, the heavy scoring of their opponent might lead to a thrashing. Luke Humphries has shown magnificent match play skills these last few months and his scoring today was outrageous. Luke Littler just beat a guy averaging 102 6 sets to 2! I'm tipping Luke . He'll either be a little too good or just get over the hump.
This final is going to be crazy. I think Luke will win it.
LOL the score sheets removed, rolled up and sold ! Lol 🦅🦅🦅💷💷💷💷💷🦅🦅🦅💷🦅
Why did PDC put up a spoiler video first!? Like this for no spolier top comment
Luke vs Luke. Who will win?
We have a special final whatever happens, I just know it. Congrats to Humphries for becoming World Number 1. He deserves it.
Unbelievable this kid. Littler is definitely the best break out talent ever. But i think tomorrow he will get pushed by Humphries. This could be one of the best ever finals. But for me Humphries stays the favourite in this one. But also probs to Cross and Williams, both played really good, especially Cross, but there were two Luke's today nobody even not MvG could have beaten. Also for me as a Shaggy Fan it was really frustrating to see him lose 0:6 but yes he really doesn't play bad so i hope he can bring this level on the Pro Tour and European Tour this year much more often
Littler has been the story of the world championship!!! I can guarantee you that tomorrow will be one heck of a final!!!
Luke may miss, Luke may hit, I can't spake 😂😂
Mi prediction for tomorrow: Luke will win😂😂
We COULD get another year of “Luke may miss and Luke may hit they’re both on nines, they’re both on a nine!?!!?!”
Come on Luke! You can do it 🎯
Congratulations to Luke for the world championship win 2024 🎉
The final is set and i am so happy that we will get the Luke derby in the final. I mean its almost guaranteed to produce some of the most stunning darts we will ever see and i just hope they both play like they did today coz that was simply INSANE. For Littler he has exceeded every expectation and it will be one of the greatest sporting achievements ever if he manages to win the biggest title in darts on debut as a 16 year old. He will smash the previous record of MVG winning it at 24 by a landslide. His performance today after weathering the early storm from Cross was phenomenal and he just looks so comfortable up on that stage like hes playing in his living room. Whatever happens tomorrow, he has had THE most stunning run here at the Ally Pally and is a major superstar in the making. For Luke Humphries he has been the best player in the world for the last quarter of a year and now his ranking can back that up. Congrats to Cool Hand on becoming World Number 1, it is so well deserved and if he lifts the Sid Wadell trophy tomorrow, it will cap off an amazing run for him with the biggest trophy in World darts. His performance today really made a massive statement and it was absolutely brilliant to watch him in full flow especially after seeing Littler playing like he did. I really am torn i dont want either Luke to lose and i just wish them both the best of luck and regardless of who wins and loses, we r looking at 2 unreal players who have the potential to take this beautiful sport to crazy heights. This rivalry will begin tomorrow in the biggest match of both their lives and will continue on for many years to come. I simply cannot wait. LETS GOOOOO LUKE(s).
Humphries all the way for me.
humphries is such a ridiculous scorer but littler may just have the finishing advantage sets up to be a crazy finale
Humphries all the way for me.
It's going to be one hell of a final🏆🎯👍
Luke ftw.
