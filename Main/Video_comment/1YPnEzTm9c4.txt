Top 10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. I took an IQ test and the results were negative.  2. Okay, who stopped the payment on my reality check? 3. Give me ambiguity or give me something else. 4. Out of my mind. Back in five minutes.  5. A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory. 6. As long as there are tests, there will be prayer in public schools.  7. Life is too complicated in the morning. 8. Sometimes I wake up grumpy; other times I let her sleep. 9. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it. 10. Few women admit their age; few men act it.   Editorial:  Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit.  Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die.  This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true:  Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said,  "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery  already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said  "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying,  thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten  Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or  guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not  God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son  to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that,  while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the  dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who  confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do  that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a  wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God  will never let you down.Visit NeedGod.com.
The mittens are so cute 😩 I can’t wait to see photos ! Reminds me when I had my baby 💖 so happy for you  IG: ale_exoxo Email : amendez638@gmail.com

This isn’t a LVE Family video w/o Laura crying
Good News❤️  Father, my words save no one, only you do. Jesus, I ask that if anyone hasn't confessed you as Lord that you help them to see their need and find the courage to believe. I ask this in Jesus's great name and for your glory. Amen   “God showed how much he loved us by sending his one and only Son into the world so that we might have eternal life through him. This is real love—not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a sacrifice to take away our sins.” ‭‭1 John‬ ‭4:9-10‬ ‭NLT‬‬  “For, There is one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity—the man Christ Jesus. He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone. This is the message God gave to the world at just the right time.” ‭‭1 Timothy‬ ‭2:5-6‬ ‭NLT‬‬  “Let me now remind you, dear brothers and sisters, of the Good News I preached to you before. You welcomed it then, and you still stand firm in it. It is this Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I told you—unless, of course, you believed something that was never true in the first place. I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said. He was seen by Peter and then by the Twelve. After that, he was seen by more than 500 of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles. Last of all, as though I had been born at the wrong time, I also saw him.” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-8‬ ‭NLT‬‬ I want to make it clear that I believe in Jesus Christ as the true Lord and Savior. I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, was sacrificed on the cross, died for our sins, and rose again. He loves us all dearly (far more than we deserve) and forgives our sins if we repent. (turn from our sins) His Word says "whoever believes in Me, will not perish but have everlasting life”.
love you babe! ❤️❤️ you are so gorgeous! 💗💗

For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13) Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-10) I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. (Luke 13:5)

Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do these things, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife  .   You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make.   Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 )  ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’  .
Congratulations!!! This has me in TEARS 😭🥺
you are the sweetest Laura 🥺🥺❤️
This pregnancy went by so fast 🥺❤️ congratulations two you both!

Jesus died on the cross and resurrected three days later so that we can be made right with God or reconciled back to God, because our sins separated us from God. The wrath and punishment that was supposed to be on us for our sins, was on God(Jesus) in human flesh. Death(Hell) is the punishment of our sins because God is just but we can receive eternal life(Heaven) through Jesus Christ alone. Repent and trust alone in Jesus Christ for he is coming soon to take his people who are saved. Jesus will give you peace and joy if you trust in him. Don’t ignore this message cause this might be ur chance to get right with God and you can die today and u might be heading to Hell, but I want you to go to heaven. If u got any questions lmk
Aw you are the cutest! Everything you’re feeling is exactly what I’m feeling! I have loved living my pregnancy along with you...even tho I don’t know you personally! Wishing you the best!! My baby boy will be here 5/17!! 💙💙💙

For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9- That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10- For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!

thanks for letting me know its emotional wouldnt have figured it out :)
I would love to get the grey one ima o happy for this family
I’m crying the way you were about to cry I was gonna start crying when you consider me as a tia 🥺🤚🏽💜
Of all the families and mothers I've watched from the pregnancy announcement to the delivery, watching you and your family carry and grow has been everything beautiful and it's truly made me more excited to ever be a mama bear one day ❤️ you genuinely made pregnancy look so so beautiful 🥺❤️
omgg me and baby LVE  have the same birthday 🥺🥺! April 28th !!
Just a suggestion, if you want your baby to latch good and help with breastfeeding hold off on the pacifier. The difference from breastfeeding and bottle is that bottle is easier and the way they use jaw is different. To develop a good latch and help them breastfeed wait to give pacifier and bottle. Just advice from someone who had to learn the tips and tricks
Please give us a review in the fajas I’m having a c section also and I wanna buy something g that’s worth it !! 😊
Congrats Guys ! Can't wait to see tha baby thats what i am really waiting on is to see tha baby i hope you have a fast recovery & hope everything came out good & safe
Congratulations LVE family

*me waiting on insta gram for a baby love picture*🥰
You will do great LVE fam!!! I can’t wait for us all to meet him! 🥰💙
NALGASSS IM NOT EVEN 5 MINS IN .. and im already emotional 🥺💕💕💕
😭😭❤️❤️ My babygirl is due in October 🤰🏻🤰🏻😍😍
I really hope you see this! Don’t feel like when you start nursing or breastfeeding that you’re not going to have enough milk, your milk supply will increase throughout the first 4 months, I started off only producing 3 oz every 2-3 hours and then by 4 months I was producing 8 oz every 4 hours. It’s supply and demand, the more you pump and nurse the more your milk will increase. Eating a lot, and staying hydrated all helps too. Don’t give up, everything falls into place! 🥰
Yay!!!! Baby coming!!! 💙🙌🙏🏼🥰
Omg!! Caint wait to see him, so excited!!!!!❤️❤️
The amazon link doesn’t work😭❤️
Congratulations lve family 🙏🏻
Such a beautiful journey! ❤️ I am so glad I got to watch it all and hope you and your whole family is healthy and happy 😊 congrats

i love how i feel so emotionally connected with you guys an now with the  baby thats coming ahhh, i'm beyond excited for you guys, i love you guys soo so muchhhhh ❤️
Why throughout this whole video I felt like I Was the one about to give birth ahhh so excited 😭 Also I saw that you had a thicker, almost like a tummy time mat in his bassinet, (I’m sure for better comfort) but I’ve read and been told that the safest thing is to have a bare bassinet sheet due to risk of sids but just what I’ve read please don’t take it the wrong way just thought I’d give my input! I had a baby a few months ago as well ☺️ do what works for you love!
Congratulations!!!
love how victor always tells u how beautiful and amazing u are🥺 @brianna.teresa

If you’re reading this congratulations on your new member of your family aka baby  LVE when you first announced you were pregnant I was crying so much it brought so many memories of when I found out I was pregnant at 16 and when I gave birth a month after I turn 17 I am crying more now I remember waking up having a urge to pee for no reason this was at 7 am on Saturday Nov 2, 2019 I was getting off the bed and I felt a big gush of water drip down my tights and socks everything was wet I was at my ex boyfriend house when my water broke i got to the hospital at 8:30 am nov 3 at 4:03 I gave birth to my beautiful baby boy  in a few days his going to turn one and half just thinking about how little and innocent they are at this age is adorable I wish I can keep him this small a little long but I enjoy seeing him grow and learn new things everyday again congrats and hope baby LVE and you is healthy and taken care of good in the hospital

I honestly can’t wait for your advice to recover from your c-section, many influencers give birth naturally so it’s hard to see what helps best bc having a c-section is very tough to recover from. I had my baby from a c-section and I’m struggling on accepting my new body and going back to ‘my regular body’🥺🥺🥺 wish you the safest recovery bc it’s really painful😣💖💖💖💖 @andreaa__26
Good luck and congratulations guys

Reading your description, congrats on your baby boy 🥺💙💙
When I had my son my breast milk took 2 days to come in after he was born and one of the nurses told me to hand express and just keep pumping so my body would start producing milk. It was painful at first but eventually it came and it was a lot! I know every women’s body is different but this is what worked for me. Wishing you guys the best of luck and congratulations on baby boy!! 💙💙 IG: Rodriguez.Jenny
