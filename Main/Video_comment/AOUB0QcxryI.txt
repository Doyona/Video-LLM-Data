i’m 27 weeks pregnant right now and i’ve been stressing about birth for so long i’ve been so scared and watching this made me feel like it’s not as scary as im expecting and that im gonna be fine
The beginning when they’re constantly cutting each other off 😅
I wish they would stop talking at the same time. Let one finish. Its annoying.
that was such an easy birth omg😂
Don’t talk over each other. It’s anoying.
Is he like 10?…
I've had 7 healthy babies and 1 miscarriage.  All natural... i couldn't imagine getting a needle in my back was way more scarier then just to man up and my 2nd baby we had potosinin. Bless y'all

Here after they are expecting baby #2
Here in 2025. I remember watching this as I was pregnant with Katie. Excited to see baby girl. I went into labor 9/13/23 with my baby boy! I actually had to have the emergency C-section though because my son's heartrate dropped. But I love watching this. Reminds me so much of having my son and my first reaction. Now you're both having baby # 2 and I'm having baby fever again. 😂😂😂
Josh should have gone out with f the room to eat that wasn’t nice that eat in front of Katie when she could not eat❤
rewatching because im so excited for baby #2
You're shaking because your body is in transition You're an active labor it's going to happen You're shaking won't stop until you're near the end or at the end
I would never eat in front of a pregnant person that cannot eat That's just wrong and kind of disrespectful but congratulations anyways
I just found out that my mom is pregnant and I am super exited bc this will be my second sibling
Who's watching this in 2025
Congratulations on the baby!! im a bit late but congrats <3

Mia if you recorded your reaction finding out you were pregnant can u show us!?
This ligit made me cry
When my kidney transplant surgeon explaine the kidney transplant process to my huband and I, I was holding his hand and felt his hand get sweaty and cold.  I looked over and he fainted.  My surgeon was so calm.  He asked, does he do this?  I yelled No!  I yelled out of the hospital rm office door to call a code rapid response to get my husband help.  Hel arrived!  The nurse put cold clothes on my husband, gave his juice, a sandwich and cookies.  I received my life saving transplant from a fellow active duty Airman!  Donate Life and be smsomeones miracle!  Also,  if you know about chord blood banking definetely bank the chord blood.  I have seen so many lives saved due to the benefits of chord blood!❤❤❤
Amy B!
It weird that doing the most dirty thing can bring the most beautiful thing in the world 😢
I’m not crying, you are.
Josh, Are You Wearing Eyeshadow???
I just cried my eyes out…😅 Am I the only one?😂
I'm sorry, but no. She expressed multiple times she was hungry, but he would not only order and talk about the meals he was going to get, but had the audacity to eat it in front of her. He said ""I'm sorry for eating in front of you". When he knows she was denied Jello while being so hungry, but instead he ate right in her face and talked about it. Then getting so fixated on himself "passing out and losing his mancard" while she is literally in labor terrified of whats happening to her baby and her body.
Beautiful video I just hated she kept interrupting him as he was talking
Momma you made that look easy. Pushed her out so easily. I'm so impressed
congration guys to a new baby love you so much
I just came from the latest video that was posted about 9 minutes ago lol It made me want to re watch this one. Spoiler alert!!!! They are trying for baby #2!!!
19:10 09/03/2023
Who here November 2024
Hi my mainms isla
She has the same birthdays as me
SO PRECIOUS
Jesus loves you all ❤
I’m praying for you guys 😊
I just watched it for the fourth time!!! So sweet
17:10 I want a relationship like this😭❤️
Might be a dumb question on my part why isn't he in a Cap and Gown in the delivery room is that not standard practice.Meaning the Expenct Dad.
Oh, geez are you guys Mormons?
Today is my sisters birthday too ❤
Katie was complaining about her shaking but it is completely normal during and after birth. It’s just her hormones being all over the place. Completely normal. Love y’all ❤❤❤
Eating in front of her was so mean, at least eat quick in the waiting room so she doesn’t have to smell and see it
Happy bday skye !!
Philippians 2:10 NIV‬ [10] that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,  ‭Philippians 2:11 NIV‬ [11] and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
Skye's first birthday ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Who’s here for 1st Skye‘s birthday? 🥳🎂🧁
Hi I’m sending this on sep 2 2024 she’s almost 1 yr old!
God is good all the time and all the time God is good and all that he does he does it well wow🙏🏽✝️⚡💞❤💯
HOW THE FLIP WAS THIS ALMOST A YEAR AGO?!
Why does he speak over her constantly
In Europe medicians say this is the worst position to give birt!
She has a beautiful name
Thank you for sharing! I'm due in 2 weeks with my first. I always planned to get an epidural, but I've been been more open to an unmedicated birth. It's just nice to see a medicated birth where the mom doesn't look like she's hooked up to a million machines, the medical staff is supportive, AND you felt the urge to push! I hope I do too.
I don’t get it how she had the baby on 9/5/2023 when she would have been born on June wouldn’t she be born on 9/8/2023 if it was September
This video is enough 2 b my birth control
❤❤❤❤❤❤
she’s gonna be a year old in less than a month!! 😢
