The fight for pole, between LH & FA in those 5 minutes roughly in Q3, was very reminiscent to when they were actual TM's around Monaco in 07. 😮
Who is here after british gp 25 today
2 years since this and im still surprise about Fernando pace
Amazing lap by Sir Lewis
Max would not have pole here not even close
Lewis Hamilton will take pole and win the 2023 Singapore GP. They were 0.25s off in race pace in Italy and we're the fastest in slow corners
lando he passt  to Fernando Alonso in 2022 singapore grand prix
Can't belive that this was already 7 months ago
How do they even understand anything at this speed. I love that engine roar.
0:18
13 seconds slower is actually ridiculous, I get that the cars are heavier for safety but it is just ridiculous how sluggish these cars look, I’m pretty sure that they would be just as fast of faster than last years cars if no weight gain was made.
i was there xddd
Wow started 3rd and ended up...  9th.   Hammy losing it.
Nice
"five one hundredth of a second"? Who speaks like this? There is nobody who can tell him how to speak English properly?
Couldn't Max just finish the lap and stop the car immediately?
I believe I speak for all Gungans when I say "Meesa canna wait for da race!"
down force spoiler new concept for makes formula keep on minimum down force while using 20 speed transmision,,likes,,5 position DRS,,front DRS,,air flow side DRS,,perhaps could touch 600 km/h on 15  speed "transmision race" future,because we also using it (transmision) to send very much torque on power plant and other generator engine type to reach new higher and bigger productivity without increasing any fuel or energy consumtion,thanks,,hhe
Donkey binotto
🇲🇽
thats aewsome  video  👍👍👍👍👍
Alonzo though
1:56 😮😮😮 What a shot 🔥
I think leclerc still has a chance for the title
That was exciting
F1 races in Singapore are often not interesting because the races are often not full laps. Races often end with time restrictions. Like playing football/soccer.
Who else is watching in 2022?
fantastic.....alo is legendary
Magnussen teaching everybody a lesson in how to qualify a racer on the lowest budget in F1.  Pure class and the fastest driver in the F1 line-up.
I have liked seeing qualifying from Singapore grand prix.
Andito si Makoy!
El Plan and the Maestro, a masterclass!
Alonso is unbelievable  If he had a better car he’d still be winning races
Get ready for "Multi 21" boys 😂😂😂😂😂😂
falta tradução !
Welcome to GP F1 in Singapore
So redbull saved the Singapore race by making max pit. Now he will come from 8th to win the race to make it interesting. Otherwise from pole it would have been straight forward for him.
La carrera como va?
Hamilton was sooooo close
Ok another pole for Leclerc but so what? 🥲
Seeing these fantastic machines running inside a gut circuit, inside a chicken cage, is depressing. The denial of the show that F1 can give
•
One of them Annoying commentator screaming too much don’t like his cartoon voice
Monaco & Singapore !!!! Real F1 Track !!😎
Wouldn't it be fantastic if Alonso takes the win?
Today may be Hamilton's Day
One of the most expensive sports in the earth 😅😂
We want Turkish Grand Prix....
Rainning
Max will clinch the Title, Ferrari will self destruct & Mercedes will moan  (a lot)
Heavy rain right now in Singapore
Alonso and hamilton are crazy
Alonso!!
I live in Singapore and during the night of the race I was like sleeping and then got woken up by 10 cars rushing by my house (yes I live near where the race is taking place)
6 different teams in the first 7 positions. Nice.
its raining oh no
Now it's time for the strategy maker for Ferrari to lose the race for lecrac
That fuel sample will get ya.
Alonso ❤️
Max why break ??? İ dont understand
I really miss Sepang with it's fast track and of course fast changing weather.
for ferrari nice qualified. NOW WIN THE RACE🤨🤨
Alonso and Hamilton were driving like bosses! 🏁🏁
The best qualy was actually from Max, but the worst was from red bull🤷‍♂️
It's funny how Lewis is 37 & still taking it to these 20 year olds in their prime. Says it all 🐐🐐🐐🐐
Perez does do much better than other drivers and almost never gets mentioned. 🤔
Lets go checo
salam dari singapura
Vettel :((
only when the track is wet. you know who the real deal is. Alonso and Hamilton.  ages like a wine.
Hamilton and Alonsi definitely had the pace
Tao po, nanjan po ba si Marcos?
3:30  STOP THE COUNT!
Alonso podium
Cry Baby Max !!! Lol
Leclerc: Yes! Pole position! Binotto: Don't worry Charles, we have all the race to ruin your day.
F1 videoları paylaşıyorum
Its criminal that Alonso isn`t in a race winning car.
Alonso will be oldest world champion soon
Verstappen getting that Ferrari™️ experience
Fernando with other car... 1st
hamilton win!!!!!!!
Lwts just hope that today we will see a little rain in the middle of the race. That oughta spice things up!
ricciardo 💀
Drink a shot everytime you hear "Provisional Pole"
Rigged again !  Red Bull waiting for Japan!
Awesome
redbull just threw away everything...no wdc in singapore anymore and everyone now catching up to verstappen. GG redbull you just played yourself
Vamos Checo
Big fan of this track. Can't wait for the race today
David Croft starting to be so annoying😒 can't hear this guy anymore
Imagine alonso in a title winning car😮
Alonso is simply the greatest F1 driver of all time
FERNANDO ALONSO   41 years, ALPINE.
Waarom moest Verstappen naar de pit
Why did max abort a lap in which he had double purple sectors
goatifi what a legend 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Gigalonoso 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 what a quali drive from both Alonso and Ham.. exceptional talents !!!!
Why verstappen not finished race time?
then Max Verstappen still win lol......
The two purple sector max lap aborted?
F1 drivers having trouble with a damp circuit, should have a look at moto 2. It's raining rivers. F1 would red flag it. I understand F1 wider tyres could be an issue, but still soft roosters.
Fk max
Consistency = latifi 🔥
All fake for the masses. Everybody looking this sh t and the elite keep killing us og.
Legend has it that Alonso still got it. Max having likely better pace but has to go through Norris, Alonso, Sainz, Hamilton unless he tries/manages to under-cut a few of them. This could be a blockbuster of a race if they can get a few clean laps of racing at the start.  Hoping for no accidents.
Hammer time!
Alonso once again showed why he can race for 5 years yet, he was unstoppable
fly Charles!
Forza Ferrari sempre
What an awesome top 3 fight.
You could just see how much quicker verstappen was on both of those final runs...  Too bad he was running out of fuel. That would have been one unimaginably dominant final time. Over 1s clear of leclerc....
Today max needs a safety car and masi to win!
Rigged!!!
Seven different Teams in the Top Ten - Just WOW!
sorte,vamos vertarpen
Please don't tell perzer for champion in Singapore gp.... Let him take the points
Noooo Latifi! this was your race I bet it all on you </3
After all these years Max still doesnt trust his team.
Alpine...  Can you imagine Alpine engineers following Alonso to AM? I can.
Here we go. Another win for max from back of the grid in sunday❤
6 different teams in the top 7. let's go
Kmmmmmmm
im sure if crofty could rename sport to formula 44 he would do it
Max😢
Not even one hamilton lap shown
verstappen prefers not to win from pole this season.
Alex albon after his surgery sure win because hes lighter now.
Why am I seeing video not available?
Ferrari🔴 No.1 always
Who’s Ocon?
Woah
red bull be like : "imma put enough fuel for quali but not for coming back to pit so it's one way suicide mission"
Those last 2 laps from Max were on another level! Too bad the team made an unfortunate rare error.
Max was almost a second up on pole lap in his last aborted lap. Even better in his previous attempt I guess.  Max and Alonso were the standout drivers today, max being so unlucky with his team messing it up. Lewis was just impressive, nothing more.
🔥
If Lewis is in front he’s gone, if max is in front he’s gone, if Charles is in front the walls are very much in play. He’s to prone to mental lapses coupled with Ferrari famed strategies any can happen during the race. There’s two drivers then the rest. Alonso too probably
lets see how ferrari will lose this one for leclerc
go Hamilton
Why was Max boxed while he was well in sight for top 4 finish? 🤔
Redbull just want to spice up the race tomorrow and see Max wins from P8.
FIA why did you allow the son of a Former Dictator in the Paddock. We just recently got devastated by a typhoon and that man, our president, is there Partying.
If max win from p8 again..merc and ferrari must  focus for 2023
Q3 was so fun to watch!
Hamilton and Alonso fighting for pole when their teammates are out in Q2.  The  young guns can't shot the old bulls.
What a great decision by Alpine to keep Ocon instead of going with an Alonso / Piastri combo 🙄
If one driver can push every ounce of performance out of a mediocre car is Fernando freaking Alonso.
Gasly. ... si seulement tu avais une meilleure voiture. ... tu serais dans le top 3 au championnat des pilotes !
Charles wearing a gold helmet like he’s a champion or something😂
Hamiltons best chance to win a race, only 1 Mercedes up front and they are usually stronger in races than qualifying.
Martin Brundle is a terrible commentator.
magnussen > russel
What happen to Max??
LEWISSSSSSSSSS
This just shows that Hamilton and Alonso are two of the greatest ever
Tomorrow is gonna be interesting
Go Lewis Go....!!!!
Best one ☝️ in a while!! More bro trips
race: 7 laps and ver is behind lec
What’s happening with Ricciardo?
How about the highlight race
How on earth everyone looks so slow
💙💙💙💙💙🤝🤝🤝🤝
Ja chego para vencer  f1 e linda  vamos  se bons aliados  se voce quiser pois o melhor  e somar a harmonia  a tranquilidade  e nunca  a miséria  pois ela trava os ganaciosos de ganhar  tranquilo
max will weeeeeen
Want to see a wet race at singapore
I love how Ferrari do great during Qualifying but what most us really wonder is why they can't do it in the actual race.
Great job Checo, when Max can't make it my Mexican brother always saves the day 💪 Vamos Checo Perez!
Are we not acknowledging kevin in Q3?
For me Lewis is favourite as that Merc easy on its tyres and it isnt about power round this track.
2:45 Stroll's LCD: "Out", "Cool"
Yuki showing talent
Blessings, John 3:16.  Jesus loves you.
Don't worry folks.. Verstappen has Perez and Ferrari strategist to win this race.
The two alpha tauri boys did great on inter.
Singapore Qualifying Is Always The Best , The Intensity Of A Night Race ❤
Great max is starting at 8 LOL
7/10 teams made it to Q3 💀
Toto call down to the stewards and have them pull Max in?  What a joke.
Hey I've seen this one before
Wait, did they not post the Practice sessions this time? I need my weekly reminder that there is a Monogasque on the grid.
Alonso  verthe scn aanallaaa🙂❇️
GRANDE CHECO
P1 - P5 approx half a second separation and 4 different teams, that was cool to watch. But yeah have got to agree, Alonso is a standout, he is pushing that Alpine to it's limits.
Singapore is my favorite race. It's #1 on my bucket list to attend. ESPN is trying to rob Dish TV so I won't be able to watch the race. Highly PO'D.
Well, it happened exactly the opposite to Max to be champion at Marina bay: Leclerc 1st, Max: 8th. Pitty for inspector Seb on his last Singapore race.
タッペンは、予選順位なんてもはや関係ない感じすらある 10番手以内なら簡単に優勝できちゃいそう
Just imagine Leclerc wins championship and Max doesn't score points due to strategy issues or car issues
i really wish Ferrari manage to execute great strategy here at singapore
George p11!?
Riccardo continues to dissappoint...looks like his F1 career will end this yr.
We all know what happens next when Charles is P1 in qualifying.
Poor Max he aborted the last 2 laps 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Grand prix singapore 2022 is bigger..
Considering the hight risk of yellow/red flag on this circuit, Max's decision to abort a lap doesn't seem rational one, though I don't know how much he lost with the slide before he abort the lap.
dont worry max, safety car will help you
I wonder how many laps before Max overtakes Checo tomorrow.
This is why we don't need sprint qualifying. Hands down best quali in this season. 2 Ferrari, 2 Red Bull, Hamilton and Alonso fight for pole in the same session is crazy.
Alonso P5, Ocon P18
Leclerc always pole but very difficult to win the race in this season
How the tables have turned
And Ferrari strategy of the day goes to ...... Red bull Racing
I could barely see anything from bay grandstand. People kept standing
Watching Alonso driving with such skill at his 41 is complete joy for me. I am closly following f1 for 20 years and I cannot comment from my experience about the drivers before that time but I am confident to say that Alonso has the worst ratio of skill vs championships won in the history of sport. I also like to look at other drivers in the late 30's or 40's. Schumacher, Raikkonen, Vettel, even Hamilton were/are showing their age - but Alonso... he is just like a fine wine. Age just doesn't affect his skill.   I am just affraid history will not value his skill enough because of only 2 championships he has won. All I can say at the end is - grande Alonso!
Fernando....🙌🏻👏
is anyone noticing how MAGNUSSEN PUT HAAS in the TOP 10
get alonso to red bull, and we will see another new history
Singapore is back boys
extraordinary very lively extraordinary event F1
タッペンって本当に怒ったら声高くなるんだなｗ
Lecrec pole and ferarri will be a joker tomorrow
Max just trying to give people a show tomorrow
Who cares, max will win tomorrow
After race : verstappen winner
Come On Ferrari, 🥰😍❤️
Obviously, Charles, Lewis, Fernando, etc. did great as well... But this season, Max is *MAX* , you know.👍
Maintenant à voir quelle merde va pondre Ferrari pour ne pas voir Charles gagner😂
Ferrari on pole, an angry dutch wins
Vamos perez representando🇲🇽🤙🏼
Why did Verstappen abort the lap when he had all purples?
Outstanding job by Max!👍
How can Norris be so much faster than Dan,come on Dan
Not sure why he does not move to Haas, It is a quicker car all round and has been all season.
Always exciting to see which of the two anointed teams will be awarded pole this week. Now the suspense is to see what innovative way Ferrari might bork it up tomorrow...
Less virtue signalling and woke propaganda, more racing please
Alonso and Hamilton here proving that age is just a number.
Tsunoda Temporary P1 in Q3 was not something I expected to see this year.......
Esse quali foi bem divertido. Se fosse em pista totalmente seca nós não teríamos tamanha competitividade.
“Come on Vettel, you’ve won so many times here”   Bro, please 😢😢😢
Is it just me or is the alpha Tauris running a new nose design?
honestly was one of the most nerve-wracking qualifying session of the year
Alonso & Hamilton goats
Even as a Hamilton fan, if there is a change to last year’s championship it WILL be devastating for the sport
Goatifi consistent af
Let's see what kind of gamble Ferrari gonna bet tomorrow
Leclerc is very strong at sprinting. The record is steady.
Why is tsunoda on inters😂
everyones talking about the top positions, and i'm sitting here smiling about Magnussens efforts
Verstappen i think gonna get furious after this qualifying.
Imagine qualifiying behind a haas but i hope haas can win this weekend here.
Aston Martin learning from Ferrari 😐
Can't wait for the race tonight!!!
Alonso is MAD
Red Bull doing a Ferrari
Fernando Alonso Díaz!! 🧙🏼‍♂️
What a wild qualifying, Max was almost a second ahead but had to abort the lap. The race is going to be very interesting.
Cop cast should be black and white for all teams. You go over your budget, you should be immediately disqualified for cheating
Why did they have intermediates in q2? Track looks dry at least?
Latifi, the harry mcguire in F1
The sky sports commentators are disgustingly biased towards British drivers! It’s really hard to listen too and if there were other options, I’d take them
Just want Vettel to have a final moment of glory. Will be there tonight.
Alondo is just amazing
Yeah so happy for my idol Fernando Alonso
alonso is still amazing....
8th is better than 10th lol.
Mañana con todo Sr TOLA Chekooo perez 🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚 las mejores vibras desde tu tierra
Fernando’s driving ability has aged like fine wine.
A touching tribute to Danny Ricciardo from both Bottas and Ocon there.
@2:40 of course he can't he's a useless silver spooner not and F1 driver
Man what i would give to see Max's lap
lol gonna be great if max just does his typical "lemme just overtake everyone and run away with it" move again
This is skills game at Singapore not just straight speed.  This is where you know who really has the skills
Vamos Checo!🇲🇽
Last time it was a night Quali it was Hamilton who didn't get pass Q2 and George was top 5.  Rules reverse
That akward fistbump to charles at the end
Alonso Magic 🤌🏼
I was planning to watch this Quali now I'm devastated I didn't
5:37 It gives me a chuckle what Crofty just said. Textbook anti-climatic
Well done Max….. keep on clash on race day👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Love to see everyone enjoying the talent
Con todo CHECO 👊🏽 todo mexico 🇲🇽 te apoyamos 👏🏽🤟🏽👍🏽👊🏽
Wow that merc had no right to be 2nd row. Bravo hamilton and alonso 👏🏽
They forget to put fuel on Max car?!
Ricciardo is so bad these days
great quli
Wait can max win the championship
I'm sure there was a problem with the timing on Maxs last lap. He had a yellow first sector and a green second sector. Yet he was basically a second up. The only way that could work (maybe) is if he was more than a second up on everyone in the first sector on his previous lap. Somehow I dont think that happened! Sounds like he was stopped because theres some funny games going on with F1...
Well done to both Charles and Carlos today. Well done Ferrari.
And then max will win the race
Checo salvando los muebles
See tsuinoda in first I knew that wasn't going to last long lol
hard to watch DR become an also-ran :(
What an amazing qualifying, alonso absolutely beasting that alpine over the circuit, amazing drive from perez and hamilton as well. And what a fuel miscalculation from redbull, max was absoluty flying, i think the sector colours for max were not right, the vid doesn’t show it but he was 9 tenths up on leclerc when he finished sector 2.
Get on with it FERRARI
alonso and tsunoda with a extraordinary quali, unfortunate p10 for yuki, he deserved more
Checo...✌😎🇲🇽
3:56/3:57 random mic unmute? or am I going insane?
Alonso is a monster
Alonso Still got The Fire Burning, It's like watching 05 Season again
Seriously though what the go with Verstappen 💯
this qualifying was intense!
6th is nothing for SuperMax. He'll come out and win this one.
Nice wall tech from Alonso.
And Now :   It's Binotto's time  !!!!  Welcome to the circus !!
Can we have an extended version of the quali highlights please 🥺
Vengaaaaaa checooooooo!!!!
What? Red Bull with a Ferrari-like mistake?
Leclerc is the fastest driver in F1. Ferrari just needs to match the quality of their driver.
Said it's 3 teams in the top 3 but it's also 6 teams in the top 6 which I think is even crazier. And it's even 8 teams in the top 10.
Leclerc Is King when it comes to Qualy
Hopefully i can see lewis on podium this time. Maybe a winner?
Wasn’t expecting a Haas to be above Mercedes
I'm not understanding. They stopped max because he was running out of fuel for the sample? Isn't the pits near the finish? The margins are so tight if they know Max will be too low on fuel by the time he finishes the lap. That's crazy.
Alonso you are a magneficent beast
Alpin trashing Alonso over Ocon... what where they thinking?
Max: Why why why we use the red car strategy!
FORZA FERRARI OH YEAH POLE BABY
Shouty commentary by a shouty man ruins it.
Another sunday where Perez will drop places before turn 1 😬 . Just an honest opinion from me . A redbull fan
Maybe we will see another crashgate
Maybe we will see another crashgate
Alonso still got it, it’s a shame he’s going to Aston Martin next year. Ending any chance of getting on the top.
Max has come back from worse, still happy for checo though ! Especially KMAG too hope to see both HAAS in the points once more depending on strategy/safety cars
This time from P8 :D
Tell me better love story than Leclerc winning Pole and MAX winning the Race LOL
La Q3 fue muy entretenida. Así deberían ser las calificaciones NO sólo dos intentos.
That just proves once again what kinda driver is alonso a legend
Very boring.
only in quali😂real race out😅
Box Box Max!!!! That gives me joy 😊 😃 😄
Que grande eres magic!
take a shot everytime you hear provisional pole
6:31 Charles doing Sebs celebration😍
Max is still going to win that.
The commentator on this last lap was amazing... They truly can create an atmosphere and hype for a magical lap.
Checo Is a beast
Hopefully (if Aston Martin don't copy Ferrari's notes), the LION of Singapore roars tomorrow!
Red Bull pulled a Ferrari moment for Max
LESSGOOO YUKI!!!!
we need to see alonso in a top car again
The cameraman filming Charles at the end got left hanging
From where did Merc suddenly find this pace?
bueno ferrari, partida de caballo , parada de burro
Let’s go Maxxx
Nobody: Max: WHY? WHAT THE FUWHY? 6:23
"Lewis is done!" "Lewis should retire!"  Looks like quite a few drivers should retire then.
About time that Latifi retires from F1🎉
I have a feeling that the scandal about last season is getting at Max. Just a feeling.
man this quali was wild
Man, Ferrari really Ferrari'd it u... wait, Red Bull were the ones to make a Ferrari of it? Okay, this is weird.
I can't wait to see what awesome strats Ferrari has cooked up for the race!!!
I am a red bull camp and a Max super fan, we are winning this season but something about me just wants Ferrari and Charles to up their game and start winning in order to have a thriller of a season like last year i don't want max to just cruise to a championship looking like he is a motorsport deity, that is boring television imo. I want that edge of the seat competition.
Worst race track in the world...garbage👎👎👎👎
Respect to latifi the most constant driver.
1:38 is that Latifi crying? 😳
HAAS is back proper
Alonso is just like wine, how older how better. Really fantastic 👏
Why are there no women drivers eh?
It is still mathematically possible for Ferrari to lose the Championship through bad strategy….😅
Alonso Better have a decent car next season
one of the best qualifying sessions this season so far, entertaining from start to finish
Shrill play by play is obnoxious.
The only thing Max want is to win in Japan. Tomorrow He wil not be a champion
Max wins
Go Checo Go
What is Raenyra Targaryen doing with Mercedes at 5:45?
Wao que pole ni más intensa 🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴💪
4:35 best line by the commentator so far hahahahah
Alonso absolute 40 years old Beast
This was one of the most exciting qualies this season so far
Lets go Verstappen!!!!
Here we go again, lec p1 in the quali .. will c in the race time,  can he make it this time?. or in the end, its vers again..
to think Max was on his way for pole or 2nd at least. but then aborted and tried again but probably ran out of fuel. so many of these moments feel like a movie! we'll see if he can win this one, but I want another Charles win please!
Well now we will surely see some overtakes because of that fuel issue. And it will be interesting to see what Ferrari comes up with. And will Perez and Lewis collide in S1 (both are pretty aggressive around each other especially Checo) .
Champ hamilton✌️✌️✌️
Who does Hamiltime bounce into tommorow 🤔
Great job by Leclerc and Ferrari! This is 11th pole position of the season for Ferrari. Fantastic!
That quali was so close in the end it's nuts.
Can't wait to see how Ferari will spoil lecrec's race this time.
Almost 9 secs gap from p1 to p20. That was crazy! Williams car could have a chance to win f2 if they join it.
Que divertido ver como despues de esa cosa ridicula que dijo sobre aue el tetracarton ama em circuito solo porque le robo una victoria a leclerc en 2019 el tetracarton hizo de las suyas cagandola porque ya no tiene el auto aplastante y dominador con el que solo con ese podia hacer algo
SR.FERNANDO ALONSO
Exhilarating it was. Hoping for unpredictable race
VERSTAPPEN SOUNDS LIKE A BABY: “WHAAAAAAAY”
FERRARI ALWAYS FAIL AT THE RACE
Alonso is just insane, what a driver
Hmm F1 Qualifying Race.
That was real fun and makes for a really interesting race tomorrow.  If the front 3 rows get away clean with no incidents, those behind will really have to use statergy work well for them, and fo course possibly crashes and safety cars.
It will be curious to see how Russell is going to get a top 5 finish
Vamos Checo !!!!!
KMAG Q3!!
Daniel Ricciardo is arguably worse than latifi right now
It'll either be an interesting race, or Max Verstappen will be leading by lap 10. Hoping for the former.
Stop screaming! Really!!
Leclerc and Perez front row can’t ask for more
Can't wait for the race, what a grid!
Doesn't matter which position Verstappen starts in, he will probably win. This season became lame pretty fast.
Goatifi moved up from 21st to 20th he’s gonna end the year with a ❗️
Let’s go checo
Max is always like this team is a load of s**t whenever he doesn’t get his way. He’s an amazing driver who’s walking away with the championship why does he have to behave like a toddler throwing his toys out the pram all the time?
what happened to verstappen
What is Bottas doing?
C'mon Lewis.
SUB T MAN FC SO YOU DONT MISS OUT ON F1 CONTENT
How come Verstapen is allowed to swear like crazy but Hamilton wearing a small jewellery is a problem? 🤷
I love how nobody speaks about Max.
Max has a face only his mother could love
Verstappen would be bored driving the last few races if he wins tomorrow
commentator of Martin Brundle and David Croft was really bad. Shocking to see them not even a single mention of Max being 9 TENTHS up compared to Leclerc.  Max was absolutely smashing the grid. and they didn't even mention single thing about it. Will Buxton and Jolyon Palmer did a far better job than the other two.
Alonso 🤝 Longevity  my 🐐
It looks like it was one of the best, and the most fun qualifying session of this season
That was a weird end for Max
Cry Max cry 😭
What this qualifying means? Vettel's record of 9 wins in a row in a season will stand. looool   Color me impressed if Max wins this one.
Checo's 2 qualy place was nice considering he's been driving different car and making the best he could, not bad viejo sabroso, hopefully is not "team orders" and let him drive... well better say hopefully they give him a chance to compete and not give "the impression" that his teammate is "killing him" as the "media" (scoff, sorry) saying.
Fuel sample? Lol
Hope either Perez or Alonso triumphs
Alonso is ready with his trailer for tomorrow
best Q3 of ALL TIME....
Tomorrow race will be exiting for me 🤩🤟
Alpha Tauri 🖤
The new Formula 1 regulations have given us much better cars, all the cars performance is so close. The cars look fast and go fast.
As Verstappen fan somehow I like to see now what happens tomorrow. No better way to motivate Max
Such a consistent performance from Latifi 👌🏼😂
Don’t worry about about Max he wants to win championship in Japan . So Honda is having a nice party there.
We all know the formula. If Leclerc gets pole then Verstappen gets 1st during the race. 😂
Checo win tomorow?!
That's an amazing top 10
Almost Checoo 😢
why is there not a truck to dry the track ??😮
my heart goes to lec, he is so fast, but he is trapped with idiots
Does anyone have sector times from Charles last lap that he aborted? He was personal best on S1 and S2 before aborting. Maybe he was also short on fuel?
Go Perez ✊🏻✊🏻
All those millions paid to  the aging Alonso, who was last on podium in 2014.
Gasly P7 with an Alpha Tauri's car, just amazing ! 👍
Alonso... What a driver, man.
Everything gets more expensive  I think the Red Bull team intentionally didn't put enough fuel in Verstappen his car, so, this year, they will stay within the budget cap
Yuki first?
JS if Max wins tomorrow I will NOT qatch another race this season!!! Trust me when I say this next statement!!! I am not the only person who have all but stopped watching because of it for lack of a better word/words BORING AF!!!
Incredible consistency again from Goatifi
Well when Lecler gets pole Max wins it’s a love story we’ve seen over and over..
Classix Max (Always Brings the Drama and Triumph)
Red Bull was like "This is to Easy , BOX BOX BOX"
Incredible drive for Fernando,  I enjoyed a lot
best quali of the season so far, no question
Redbull = cheating
how generous from max to let others shine
Why no one is not talking about Latifi 🖤
9 pole position for ferrari. Charles Leclerc hopefully convert this time.
Why is Perez always ignored in the post race shows?
Leclerc wins tomorrow with Sainz third and Verstappen second that’s my prediction. Verstappen will be world champion’s tomorrow which is a shame. Hopefully Ferrari does a better job next year.
Who was crying in the Williams garage?
No worries Max will still win
Tomorrow the cars run on a diferent engine mode.... and Max will pass them one by one!!!
How can Aston Martin go above budget cap and still have such a bad car
Leclerc is a king of Pole position and Air Max is a king of winning races....
Very interesting
Norris breaking the matrix out there. Not in 7th this time!
Verstappen will win
I for once was hoping Max wouldn't get pole. Make the race more interesting
Max wasn't just "near" pole position on his 2 laps there, he was 7 tenths up by the 2nd sector both times. Mans was absolutely gonna blow P2 out of the water by at least half a second, but this may have been the biggest bout of Red Bull miscommunication ever
Hamilton has pace for this race. Hopefully we see a first or another podium 🙏🏽
Charles Leclerc is on pole and Carlos Sainz is P4 in F1 Singapore Grand Prix Qualifying 🇸🇬
Is max the new cry …baby hahahahaha
grande fernando !!
Hamilton is going to be amazing in the race, he is the master of the wets, also Alonso might get a shot at a podium when the Ferrari strategist ruines everything
Another opportunity for Charles and Ferrari to BOTTLE it...
Memories of the last true golden era of F1 2007. Hamilton and Alonso last of a dying breed
That box max box box box was the most SOS box i have ever heard..
6 different manufacturers in the top 7. I love it when there is rain or a wet track. Mother Nature is a great equalizer.
6:09 such a dissapointing performance from Verstappen
This was the wildest Qualy session of the season for sure
Hard race for Ferrari to ruin… I’m sure they’ll manage!
Mclaren with no pace at all
Finally Ferrari got a gift from Red Bull... it was about time.
Checo, Checo, Checo!!
What happened to verstappen?
Lo de siempre. Espectacular clasificación de Leclerc para que mañana el equipo lo arruine.
"Box, box, box, box!"  "WHY?!?! What the f----????"  LOL!!!
HAMMER TIME BOIS
This might be an interesting race actually
Poor leclerc qualified to get messed up by himself or by his team anyway
Day 1000 waiting for Goatifi to finish on pole
majestic
Unfortunate for Max and Red Bull, but in all honesty, I love seeing him charge through the field! Here's to hoping the start stays clean!!
Hamlton is the best
Verstappen  sobrar ,gana mañana
Verstapen will anyway. In LAP 10 he will be 1st or 2nd.
FORZA FERRARI 👍🏻
I bet RedBull will retire Max then super saiyan that car in Japan
lewis and alonso..show us how to drive like a legend
Time to unleash Mv33 🔥 🔥
Redbull have been inspired by Ferrari
Hamilton v Alonso?
Netflix is going to make Q3 even more dramatic 😂
Fuel samples. The thing no one wants.
YUKI ON GRID LETS GO BOYZ
I hate and love this track
Singapore is by far the most exciting track
Was there a reason given why Max backed off on the second last lap just before the end of the lap? He had two purple sectors.
WINNER MAX VERSTAPPEN ✅
And Ferrari will do "Ferrari" things during the race...
Stressful
Wow Alonso really got some pace on that track !
Does anyone else have to turn down the volume BECAUSE THIS COMMENTATOR IS ALWAYS SHOUTING?
Max was wicked quick today … even after having so many moments in a single lap he was on a pole position lap
Hamilton and Alonso show why they are multiple-time world champions ❤
yawn .......
Leclerc should just try to get the most poles in one season then fight for a championship
VAMOS CHECO A POR LA VICTORIA MAÑANA, TU PUEDES VIEJO SABROSO
Alonso pushing his Alpine to unexpected limits every f* time man. Godlike racecraft.
6:04 Max is gonna be on pole!!!       Sike!
I can't stand how the narrator keeps calling "Yuki Tsunoda" as "Yuki Sunoda". The T is there, and it's not silent. Why doesn't he pronounce it?
That was awesome
Alonso 5 = A classic.
Congratulations max for the win
Hamilton for the win tomorrow coz ferrari will mess up their strategy
Did they know this was a quali sheesh
Does anyone know why Max backed off first time in q3 when he had two purple sectors?
Ocon, go home
This felt like Hamilton was about to do one of his very special laps. And in a way, given his car, it was a special lap.
penelties  for whoever  for anything. this race will turn into a circus .  guaranteed😮
Forza ferrari
Ima miss gonetifi
Still perplexed how Lewis did. 1:36:15 around here in 2018
Porsche, please buy Williams
4:44 - Imagine if Max completed that lap...
Well we've seen Max win from farther back, so the odds of him sealing the WDC tomorrow haven't changed much.
Red bull did a ferrari move
Max for the win then.
Mentioned this on FP1. RB seems not into this weekend. It just feels like they want it done in Japan. I don't want to believe this but it feels just like it.
yesssssss
Loved seeing KMag in Q3!
Incredible talent!! Incredible driver Alonso... With an alpine he is capable of fighting for pole, how does he do it???
Súper!!
Alonso is a monster , the only thing slows him down is his car
@1.34...  hold ALL the lines in the world!!!! Who is she and what's her name?!?!?!
Ricciardo is sure not making himself look like a candidate for a seat ever again in F1
Why did max have to pit
Tomorrow, Hamilton will Win , believe me. 🙂
Alonso padreando como siempre
Ok w
Nice to se Alonso
It’s almost like it was planned….
Just being on the grid for most tracks is like pole for Max.
Ok, so if Hamilton was that quick, did they change his car only or did Russell simply not adapt to the car?
That was a bit ironic….
FORZA FERRARI please win it tomorrow ffs      I wonder what kind of thing/strategy they would do to break our hearts again
Oh man this was an exciting one, RB really fumbled the bag for Verstappen
3:56 You can hear a man talking suddenly.
Ferrari on Saturday 😍 Ferrari on Sunday 😔
RBR only wins by bribing.
NOOOOOOOOO DUDE!!! What the heck Christian?! Why did you tell him to back off?
Lets go Lewis..0.54 ffs.Come on champ all the best for tmrw.💜✌️
2:36 2:55
Hamilton  👍
Alonso had a rapid session
Venga checo ❤️🇲🇽
Nah Red Bull did a Ferrari there. Aborted a lap that would 100% get pole to do one as late as possible so that the track would be at the  perfect conditions only for them not to have enough fuel to do that lap and abort it for a 2nd time...
I thought the game will be boring from now on but it just became better , i hope tomorrow is as interesting as this quali
please remove that dutch commentary in the option in the app or at least make sure we can hear Olav and Jack with granprixradio. those guys from VIAPLAY get the fun out of the sport I loved since I was a little kid.
VetteL! Rooting for you man, lets see you top 10
c'mon merc
6 different teams in the top 7 spots!!
2 purple sectors from Max, but told to Box box! 😧
Ferrari stop doing this to yourself lol stop giving yourself hope 😭🤣
let's hope Nicholas Latifi can get hired at Red Bull next year, I'm sure its in the works. Latifi won Verstappen the championship last year. Red Bull would be Lucky to have Latifi
Seeing Alonso in P5 makes me wonder why he won’t stay with Alpine next year…Aston Martin look pretty bad
Riccardo 😭
daje charles ❤️
If there was a qualifying championship, Charles would be smashing the competition lol
ALONSO ALONSO ALONSO
why won't it load?
How this commentators idolize Lewis!
If Mercedes’ are struggling with tire warmup and Hamilton got that position he will be flying tommorow
By the end of lap 3, once DRS kicks in, MAX will be in fourth.
VAMOS SPAIN! VAMOS ALONSO!
Leclare pole Max win
Max is trying to win from every starting position this year 😅
YUKI!! First time racing in Singapore and he's in Q3!!
Never seen Hamilton make mistakes like verstappen has in his career. Verstappen is no where near the driver Hamilton is. Crashtappen is overrated in a rocket ship of car and had to cheat to get where he is
GOATifi at his best, 21th in the classement under 20 drivers! Only Hulk is better than him, 22nd.
Alonso is pure masterclass
Interesting 🤔
Props to merc actually for getting that close
Red Bull is in the eye of the hurricane x the badget cap affair, the slyers of the Red Bull wall have stopped Max Vestappen for the pole, x not to increase Red Bull's suspicions on the budget cap. In Red Bull they are smart
P5 for Fernando. :'-) ... Just beautiful. <3 C'mon, ALO! Good luck, tomorrow.
Cacing tanah 🐛
Riccardo just flying down the straight in 6th gear. Not shifting at :40  What a bozzo
Verstappen has been bewitched, evil eye.  Tomorrow the magic is broken and Verstappen wins as usual.
Alonso is most entertainment driver in F1. Live LEGEND
The abort was very sad
6 different teams in the first seven positions! Amazingly entertaining!
That was absolutely epic for a quali
AMAZING QUALIFYING SESSION. Except for Latifi. He needs to be dropped for the rest of the season my goodness. What an L.
Super Ferrari
Oh the yelling…
Cuidado con Checo....
Perez é muito rápido nessa pista. Incrível 🤔
verstappen had sector 1 and sector 2 fastest and aborted???? ferrari strategists at redbull?
Cómo siempre se llevan los primeros lugares en la pole....y RedBull volverá a ganar.
"This is the last time you're gonna qualify around Singapore" bro this hit me so hard 💔
scripteeeeddddd
Verstappen 🤡🤡 RedBull 🤡🤡
That Quali was Amazing from Q2 to Q3 is world Class
Hamilton kiru kiru
Why did max not push on his penultimate lap? That would have secured him on pole anyways and then he wouldn't have the issue on the last lap
Lewis is gonna back i think , he is getting back
Hamilton 2021 champ. Not verstepen
Ferrari ❤️ All The Best Charles ❤️
Que padre es
Can we talk about how Alonso was on provisional pole not 1 but 2 times
Hamilton destroying Russel on pure pace again just to make the haters hate more lol
Come on Charles!!!🤘
Seeing Hamilton and Alonso fight for too spots is so refreshing, also Max gave Charles pole cuz he know he won’t win then 😂
as a max fan this quali was painful, but as a f1 fan it was amazing
Empty fuel tank🤔 no wonder!
Another pole for Leclerc but it will be another gifted win for Verstappen
Sebastian is German so his last name is pronounced with an "F" sound. And it's RiccIardo, and not Ricardo. Can't you guys read?
Kmag to Red Bull now!!
Ferrari powerful just qualification but, when race, ferrari 👎👎
OOOOH YEAH the battle for second place on the championship is there! Checho vs Leclerc!! oh man the first lap tomorrow will be wild!
Mercedes top..odeio max
🤣 So Clearly Staged, Controlled & Fixed - Fml People 🤦🤷🤦🤷
Ferrari is only for qualifying... not for the win the race
If max win tomorrow
Who needs sprint when we have this action in normal quali
Such a great quali! Vamos Lewis!👊🏼💜
so if verstappen hadn't stopped he wouldn't have had the legal amount of fuel..... hmmm!? Red bull consistent as usual
Max must have smashed something after coming out of his car. He was furious at the interruption 💀
how did ric end up in the bottom 5... almost feels like he is going to alpine and going slow on purpose now.
Let’s go Sergio show your Mexican power out there tm 🇲🇽 🇲🇽!!!!!
Helmut Marko said that it would be preferred if max took the Championship in Japan at their home race for brand reasons so maybe that's why they made him abort but didn't wanna make it look obvious
Daniel once again reinforcing why he's been fired from McLaren
Let's see how Ferrari screws up Lecrec this time.
Top tier quali day
Don’t worry Redbull, Ferrari strategists are on your side =)
I think my neighbour can hear the commentary through my headphones.
**angry max noises**
So sad for Vettel also, this was his last Qualifying in Singapore :(
It is the race for Sergio Perez
Cry baby Max always crying as usual. 🍼
no fuel left for verstappen, that explains his loose rear. when 5 pounds of gas makes a traction difference...eeks!
i thought here comes another STARDUST!!!!!!!!!!!
hmm wonder which new way Ferrari will find tomorrow to mess this up..
Please give a competitive car to Fernando! what an impressive driver!
Let’s go Red Bull
Va a salir el papá de verstapen que nuevamente le cambien el carro a su hijo
As much as I want to see Verstappen shatter the win streak record, I really want to see Hamilton on the top step this weekend
Don’t worry, Max is going to drive through from 8th and take the win.
Cómo siempre Sainz no puede con LECLERC
Pérez 🤩👍👌
Leclerc is just too fast
It is actually amazing to see Red Bull roped some Ferrari strategists. Nobody else in the world is able to ruin the fastest driver's lap TWO TIMES in ONE quali session. Pure italian masterclass.
Salute to Fernando Alonso
Hamilton should be champion
Go max
This thing with the fuel is utterly ridiculous , Max had enough to complete his lap , last year Seb already lost a well deserved second place in Hungary because of this bulls**t , I said it before and I'll say it again : Destroy the rules
Alonso in this Ferrari would've been a champion.. Best driver currently
Would love to see the best drivers on the grid competing for points instead of just the best cars.
Red bull can't afford fuel now lol 😆
Two freaking Legends Hamilton and Alonso are even when they give great banter to the fans LOL
The old reminds the young to stay humble
Zhou beating Bottas every weekend lol
Alonso and Hamilton keeping the two top teams honest was a joy to see.
Magic Alonsoooo
Hey guys I’m new to F1, what’s the difference between Q1, Q2, and Q3?
Max and red bull has alot to do come tomorrow. Because this race track isn't ful of over taking areas. I hope for the best for Max tomorrow. Go max go
Watch a million penalties happen
Fernando Alonsoooo
So Max is worrying about having enough fuel for the officials to test.  If only Red Bull worried about all the other rules, for example the spending cap.  They broke the rules spending too much money but they haven't had a penalty for that, because it's OK for Max to break the rules.  It's not surprising they have the fastest car when they don't stick to the spending cap.
Come on Ferrari
F11111.... Ferrrrrrarrrriiii
Seems like Redbull and Max have their heart set on taking the crown at Hondas Suzuka next week.
Always watching from Georgetown Guyana south America 🇬🇾🇬🇾🇬🇾🇬🇾🇬🇾🇬🇾
Fun to see the results of a qualifying where the cars performance matters less and RB cant take full advantage of their Honda engine
Fernando 40years on Air 🏎️
Alonso and Hamilton putting out some world champions pace today
So refreshing!
Im Just waiting for verstappens Victory tomorrow
Alonso STILL showing the young bois how its done.
if max wins from 8th here to clinch the title leclerc should just retire lol
0.054s from 1st to 3rd
Tomorrow's race is going to be very dramatic. And I'm all for it! 🙂
Lewis was flying
Classy Charles!!!!!
Max is a show man. He didnt want to finish the WDC so soon.
I wish alonso stayed at alpine from a competitive car to a bad car
Fraudtas getting found out again
GASLY🔥🔥🔥
Ocon: after hamilton  i'm the fastest teammate f.alonso ever had Jenson button: you wish! Next qualy, ocon p18 alonso p5 🤣
yuki tsunoda too brave beat the time limit , this should be first .
lewis❤
Alonso ...he is the Champion all time !!! ...with Crown or without  Crown !!! 🏎☄🏆🏅🎖🥇👑🎩
06:39 Leclerc left the cameraman hanging 💀
Redbull, preventing Max from winning only for him to do it in Japan? 🤔
RED BULL WENT OVER THEIR FUEL ⛽️ QUOTER  FOR THE YEAR  !
So Leclerc pole and Verstappen way back, I predict a clear win for Verstappen... 😢
Max is playing rope-a-dope with the rest of the field. Dials back on qualifying, otherwise he would have been on the pole. Yup.
RB likely fuelled Max for 1 flying lap plus some spare, but when he essentially tried to do two flying laps he was going to run out.
Goatifis consistency is so impressive, especially compared to the likes of Charles Leclerc.
As a Ferrari fan all I can say is besides the fact that I'm happy for Charles getting the pole position, I love the fact the I've always known that Fernando is the best driver out there and  he is what 40 years old?
What happened to max?
P8 for Verstappen means he's going to win by 20 seconds tomorrow
I understand why Verstappen had to pit at the end, but can someone explain to me why RedBull told him to abandon the lap before that? He was on a clear pole lap and could have just finished it and driven another flying lap after that one right?
This was savage .
Poor Max, he was 9 tenths up in the 2nd sector, hopefully he can climb back up tomorrow❤
Well It's One Well Done Perez , tomorrow is " two for the show " . Go for it !!!
Congrats Charles for the pole 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾Well done.
Quite the exciting qualifying! Interesting to see how Perez and Leclerc will duel in turn 1 and 2.
👍
Two AlphaTauris in Q3!
How about that? Looks like max used too much fuel?
That Qualifying race was Awsome !   Mad pace and everyone was pushing haRD 👍👍👍😁
Only in F1 can the highlights be too long and boring
Oh this is gonna be lovely
Let’s just hope porridge man can finish the race this time around! 💪
2019 Singapore Grand Prix: Qualifying  1:36.2 LECLERC    13.2 second faster
It makes me so happy that Fernando is still capable of putting performances like these at the age of 41 , such a shame he will be driving Aston Martins next year 😭
what happened to Russell?🤯
Max will come back don't worry guy's! 😉
What just happened here???? 😅😅😅
Verstappen was actually told to pit so the race would be at least a bit interesting. Now it should take more than 10 laps for him to take the lead. Hopefully.
For people still doubting Hamilton this shows that he's still the best but just in a slightly banged up car.
Man once the car gets better next year Lewis would be fighting for championship again just like his whole career. One tough year people say he washed.. Natural talents like him and Alonso would never wash away at any age but these max kids who are fake f1 fans will never understand. 😅
Wet track is great equalizer. Alonso nearly pulled the same magic in Canada. Right?
Oooh latiffi didn't make it, I'm impressed HAHAHAH
Ferrari masterplan. Perez so clutch.
Red Bull did a Ferrari today. Hope that wake up call got through. They threw away a certain pole position twice. First telling him to abort penultimate lap and missing the fact that he would run out of fuel way too late.
Convinced that RB and Max just want to take the DHL Most Overtakes in a season trophy😤
This is my 1st time seeing the Singapore gp and wow its beutiful. I love that tunnel looking section with the green lighting
Why is the thumbnail in the wet
Everyone talking about Alonso driving like a beast until you realise what he's gona drive next season even Verstappen can't win in that thing.
Has to be one of the most exciting qualifyings I've ever seen.
Pourquoi elles marchent pas ces Alfa Roméo !? Cela devrait aller plus vite  .....
Latifi is 8 secs slower than pole???
8 of not , Max You are Going to win This race !
Alonso is insanly fast!!!!
Now this is F1 BACK TO INTERESTING TIMES!!!!!!!
That was the first mistake I’ve really seen RBR make with Max…misjudging his fuel.
Alonso and Hamilton fighting for pole gave me goosebumps and flashbacks.
Never have seen such a difference between Q1 and Q3. Until 1st and 10th, are almost 4 seconds, that's crazy, I don't remember ever have seen such a time difference in a qualifying.
and now imagine Alonso with a car from the top 3?? and still people thinking he is old and his prime its over, Alonso its a superclass  driver .By the way, has anyone seen Ocon?
I'm cheering for the American driver...lol What's the FIA afraid of?
It’s so scary seeing the Ferrari on pole
תמשיך לחלום  מקס יטרוף אותך
Look at Alonso history, barely any loyalty to any team, more like a gun for hire, and no, just a few race does not make him great, throughout eras there are many who have races they are great at, and sometimes the car is in their favour on some tracks, that doesn’t make you great or “still got it”. The same as top pros in motorsport that don’t care about publicity tanking say that Hamilton and Mercedes’ can go f**k themselves, the same as analysts that predicted Hamilton was going to lose in 2020 or 2021 if he doesn’t improve his driving since 2018, the same as stats don’t lie when Hamilton has by far, the easiest f1 era, where the only era the car does all the work that when Hamilton actually has an opponent, he loses, a very bad record and not the only bad record he has that other champions doesn’t, that includes most accidents.
Williams need nick devries 🤭🤭
Alonso may have been expensive signing for Alpine, but it was better to avoid start of season shenanigans and keep him instead of Ocon. Great move for Aston Martin there.  Not sure what happened with Verstappen, but Red Bull tends to have unmatched race pace this season.  Mercedes and Hamilton seem to have steady improvements trough the season. This time is third by minimal margins, maybe will have strong pace tomorrow.  Ferrari is very consistent in qualifying, but tire management is another story. Perhaps lacks downforce and finishes the tires too quickly in the turns, forcing them to reduce pace. Raw speed is obviously there.
Por asegurar el segundo y tercer lugar Quienes lo ocuparán? en la fórmula uno 2O22
VAMOS CHECO!!!
why did max abort the lap when he had 2 purples sectors?
the commentators should eat Carolina Reapers and do the race commentary
Ayrton Senna GOAT for win everyone hearts Michael Schumacher GOAT build the team from zero to hero Lewis Hamilton GOAT the f1 statistic Everyone can have their argument but for me  FERNANDO ALONSO is The Greatest of All Time Driver who can maximise every inch every ounce every capabilty of his car to the limit ! The one and only
Ver p1 by lap 9?
Lets hope Quali isnt the highlight of this weekend.
Alonso will take his usual outside line through turn 1 and pop up in 3rd
Ocon still thinks is close to Alonso hahahhaha
yessss leclerc on pole.... cant wait for verstappen to win
Honestly, Alonso needs a better car.
perez mexicoooo
Wow. Hamiltons best chance of a top step. You wdnt bet on Red
Max Verstappen wins the Singapore gp
It's hammer time common sir Lewis let's get that 1st win. Waiting from India 🇮🇳
I wish Alonso was in a top tier car, I love watching him drive.
Max ez win tomorrow
What a Q3. Tsunoda was close to set a sensational pole. Hamilton, Alonso and Leclerc in an amazing battle for P1.
Hamilton💪🔥
Ferrari the best F1 Car in 2022, but the Driver and the Strategy is too bad...
Finally Leclerc gets a break, now only if Ferrari doesn't mess it up tomorrow that'd be wonderful.
This is somewhat intriguing if Verstappen could win again...
A bit sad to see how Leclerc getting pole isnt even celebrated, barely acknowledged - cause we all know that pole means nothing - tomorrow Ferrari will find a way to lose it
P2 great result for Pérez!
Perez has a lot of chances to win this one, we all know Ferrari will f$ck up Leclerc´s race.
Leclerc pole, max champion lol...
Max was coming with 2.5 secs faster than his previous time. It would've been pole by 6 tenths
New Video on Monday - "Max Marches from P8 to the clinching Win!"
Great class and drive from Alonso and Hamilton !! Expecting VSC and many close fights tomorrow😀
championship on the line 🤝 Verstappen bottling qualifying
Vamos 44 ya esta mejor el w13
By far the best quali of the season, felt like 7 drivers were fighting for pole
I wonder why Max aborted the 2nd last lap when it seems he could have been fast enough to be on pole. Then they ran an extra lap and risk running out of fuel. If Max win in Singapore, that will be an amazing feat
Max after qualifying: Oh no! Anyways…..
Alonso deserves rookie of the season.
Let’s see what’s in the big bag of Ferrari to make the champ lose as they did it multiple times previously..
Will some crush under the race...  CL will be the great race take many points and  he will happy and of the race
My main questions are why did Red Bull box Max on a fast lap and why Max listened to them
Can we talk about the cameraman that got left hanging by Leclerc 06:40
Costcappen p8 😂😂in illegal super-funded car
Ferrari fans pray with hope and desperation tonight.......
"This race has never been won from lower then 4th".  Yeah we've heard those words earlier in the season.  I will give Perez the win tomorrow as Ferrari shall shoot itself in the foot again.
Max was fastest on track for sure.
Leclrec on pole, verstappen wins the race...
great job from alonso's best teammate (ocon) almost beat him today
Essa é a situação real... Quando a FIA favorece a Verstappen a fórmula 1 fica sem graça.
Hammertime 🤦‍♂️💜 0.054
Weird how all of a sudden max is struggling , hmmm
does anyone else feel that there is no way daniel Riccardo is just this bad ..? it's almost as if he is intentionally trying to make mc claren look bad.  haha
Alonsooooo!
How bad does Alonzo hate driving for Alpine that he'd leave them to go to a much worse performing one?!?
COME ON MAGIC ALONSO ! YOU AND MAX MARCHING THROUGH THE GRID TOMORROW
What a Superb Qualifying that was 🔥
Ocon :"This year I´m faster than Fernando" Fernando: "And I took that personally"
Cheers from the Pacific West Coast of Canada.
Anyone else’s morning get ruined by Sling/Disney?
Russells performance was just embarrassing
Nobody gonna talk about how yuki got P1 in q3 for a time? I mean even Charles can't beat his time
Even the fastest guy can't pass in this track
拿桿位也要第一名完賽….不要又被後勤搞砸了⋯⋯那個智障卷毛的⋯⋯
Don't know why max backed off on the previous lap, he would have been on pole with that lap
Can’t wait for raze hope Verstappen crashes in s3 lol
Is anyone still interested in this qualifications ? We already know who's gonna win tomorrow, so why so excited? Even Charles was like meh
GRRRR video not available
If max was 2.7 sec faster(claimed by him in post quali interview I think charles doesn't stands any chance nor Lewis.
Are there any drivers actually close to Verstappen's level of skill and talent lol, even though he didn't get the pole today, he's got the championship in the bag. Realistically, how close is the next best driver, because it looks like all the other drivers are f2 or f3 drivers in comparison haha.
Alonso 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Perez was so so close
Ocon showing how to do it to Alonso 😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Redbull fan here but Rooting for Alonso,Lewis and checo to be the podium takers!
Wow, that was a huge, and rare mistake for RB ~    But HUGE American problem for Formula 1 -  DISH network just dropped ESPN channels at midnight so we can't see anything, no Q, no race tomorrow. There goes the American viewership!
Alonso is just pure Class !
Mañana queda en 1# Checo 🦾🇲🇽
What happened to George Russel? Why such a poor result? There is an explanation? Or just a bad driving or poor settings for once ?
The Hamilton haters are quiet again on Saturday
anybody else just crushed because of RIC?
FORZA FERRARI!!!!!
So many casuals getting shocked by Alonso. *sigh*
Alonso. Never disappoints. The man is an entertainer..
Sigan diciendo que Alonso está finiquitado, están rezando para que no consiga un coche medianamente competitivo. Ocon no pasa ni el primer corte y él se mete con los lobos.
6:45 IN fact Martin, you can say 7 different teams in the top 9
Poor Max 😂😂😂
Alonso is lit
I swear I’ve seen this Quali before: Leclerc Q1 and Verstappen Q7 or Q10 or Q15.  Wonder how this will turn out based on history.
Since when did Ferrari was running Read Bull, lol 🤡
Looks like a Hamilton win
Verstappen's behavior reflects that of an upset toddler when told to sit down and be quiet.
Lol max stepping out n down gave a bunch of peasants a chance
qualquer petista sabe que Alonso não será mais campeão. Como não somos petista vamos torcer para o tio bater furar um zoio e deslocar a coluna. ai DRUGOVICH correr 2023 inteiro e vai dar um baile no fiotão Strol. kkkkklkk. Tá muito fácil. contrato assinado.
Why F1 Hide Verstapen 2 Sector -0.900 Faster than a Leclerc?
Getting some serious “through goes Hamilton” vibes with this grid order 😂
im not a max hater, but im looking forward to a race where its not a foregon conclusion that he wins
Alonso was craaaaazy 💪💪
😮😮
Jos will be DEMANDING his boy be given Pole, just for being his boy!!
We all know Verstappen wins though so... Yawn.
Checo Perez es el idolo de mi primo chico.
Tsunoda pole 1 . i think it’s time to we belived the end is near . 😅
I'm torn between supporting Alonso, Leglerg, or Super Max. I want Max to continue his winning streak, but small part of me want Charl to chase the points and the other small part of me want to see Alonso getting a win after a long time.
Nobody talking about the great redbull strategy?
Goatifi on top as usual. 🐐 🇨🇦
Alonso 🙌👑
I love Danny Ric, but he doesn't deserve a seat after this year. He's doing so much worse than Norris and can't even get out of Q1 half the time.
max faked pole twice
Alonso fighting for P1 in Q3 meanwhile Ocon didn't even smell the Q2
Verstappen looser!
Ferrari strategy at redbull 😭😭, what was that
Who am I ? LAST FP1 LAST FP2 LAST FP3 LAST Quaylifying  Clue you ask ............   🐐
Ya quiero ver la salida de Alonso mañana 👌
I'm sure Leclerc can turn that Pole into 4th by the finish of the race. Did Max have Ferrari mechanics today?
Can someone explain me why MV has been called to stop?
Hope tomorrow Charles champion
Max için kolay bir yarış olacak 8.lik..
wow! at last an exciting qualifying session! and a top 3 in a blink of an eye kind of gap...the race should be interesting!! go Lewis.. I'd say... but I could as well say go max... win this year.. this year, you do fully deserve it!
Alonso is a big driver, if he has a better car, he will win some races...
One of a kind qualifying in some time
NOW VERSTAPPEN'S DAD WILL START TO HOWL, CRY AND BARK  (LIKE AFTER MONACO)  :   " REB BULL IS FAVORING CHECO ¡¡¡   IT'S NOT FAIR ¡¡¡¡¡   RB'S PRIROTY IS CHECO ¡¡¡¡  IT'S NOT FOR FAIR FOR MY BABY MAX ¡
Why.....What the F...why?
This is what we've been missing for 2 years. Singapore GP was dominated by Alonso and Vettle. Alonso is still hungry for more and sadly the last Singapore GP for Vettle. This year with Leclerc and Verstappen in the mix, Hamilton and Perez showing pace, exciting!!
Awaiting the Ferrari fiasco tomorrow!
Max CostCappen on that unlimited budget
It was a nail biting Q3
Doesnt matter if max p8 he will win anyway
LECLERC.. Me gustaría, así como haces el mejor tiempo, ganes tbien la carrera.
Perez will do the job on Lec 😂, mark my words, won’t make it past T1.
What are the odds in Max putting it in the wall on Sun trying to fight to the front?
Make a comeback mercedes...
Red Bull: We have VTEC!  Power and fuel economy at the same time! *VTEC: Yeah... but not both at the same time!* Red Bull: ?!... Oh snap Stop the car stop the car! ...
Go Alonso!!!
Just to make it interesting for everybody enjoy the race 😉
Let's go Maxx
Qualifying in wet is not gonna decide    Sunday's pole if it that happens under sunny n dry conditions. Max starting from lower the grid always makes the race day more exciting.
Oh my Max has started far back before this season but not with so many contenders in front of him. They're not going to just let him through. He is their race. Should be a thriller.
pole champonship: leclerc. Real champonship: verstappen
Not vettel
Just speechless after being at Singapore GP! the cars look amazing, they sound amazing, are aggressive and the atmosphere is just great! Looking forwards towards the race tomorrow! I'll be on the Empress grandstand with a big Ferrari flag, if you see me, come give me a fist bump and stay for a chat 🤘
What a session from Alonso!
Fernando Alonso is a majestic talent. Age really is just a number with him. He has the potential to fight for titles even now if he had the right car. Magical behind the wheel.
chaotic energy, this qualifying
Who is racing?? the pit management or the driver, there is a need for change to the rules to get back to purist racing.
I think it's sad that almost none of the midfield teams can really go for pole even in mixed conditions like these. You see how fast Alonso was, but still his time got obliterated
Ferrari has the most powerful car this season, Leclerc at his best,but the strategic team killed it all,very disappointing for Leclerc and Sainz.
Perez 🇲🇽💪🏻
Oh boy, can't wait for another race where Charles loses spectacularly from pole. 😢
@f1 - 10 seconds of Q1?
they robbed max lap bruhhhh
What a great quali for the oldies. Wth happened with Russell ?
Imagine Alonso in a Redbull or Merc!!!!!!!! He leave lewis way behind
Ocon: "If I look at Fernando's career, the only team-mate at his level was Lewis. Everyone else has not done better than me."    That didnt age well..
Fernando is underated star in qualy. Tomorrow I wish Alonso finish on the podium!
A race I want to watch
Can u imagine if that would have been seasons First Race  ..
The best quali of the year. At moment
Great drive by Alonso in that car!!!!
P1 as usual for Leclerc. Let's hope Ferrari doesn't mess that up.
Ferrari pole position... And Max start from behind P8 Why this look so familiar ???  You know how this end...
You can see in this track the bottleneck is the driver itself. We have the most experienced drivers in TOP 5.
Realistically this is Mercedes last chance to bag a win this season. All the tracks after Singapore require a lot of straight line speed. I’m not saying it won’t happen it’s just not likely after this race.
Quali: PEEWAN  SHAARL Race: PEESIX CARLETTO 😉
Alonso still needs a better car to get another world championship. Period. He will be driving with same consistency for coming 20 years minimum.
It's a sign, Max is going to win tomorrow 🏆
Nice. Work alonso he defo deserves one more run in a top car
Alonso is giving the kids a driving lesson this weekend!
if only they'd let seb finish his flyer
Glad to see F1 at Singapore again.
Alpine  ruining ocon for their golden boy whose gonna retire in  the next 2yrs
Ahhh the controversy so max don’t win too early. Cause too many races left. Keep sport entertaining and make money.
The race tomorrow it's going to be ruled by the pits, there are no spaces to make an overtake to the car in front
why a fuel sample for max ? did they suspect something?
stepen menang plk ase esok..
this was the best quali of the year
Maybe Red Bull hadn't got enough budget for the fuel
my predictions for the next race will be  1 MAX VERSTAPPER OR CHARLES LECLERC 2 PEREZ OR HAMILTON  3 CARLOZ SAINZ OR MAYBE ALONSO 😄
the times keep improving on and on because the track is drying, the fact that the weather gives us much more action is a bigger reason why we should have more races in Asia since we have one of the most unpredictable climate.
Why were they using inters, rain?
I didn't expect RB and Max to f that on up. They were so much faster than the rest of the field.
max aborting his second to last lap is so dumb, he could have had it there
About Half a tenth between the top 3... That's what you like to see Probably not many noticed this because the amount pf action in this quali...
Why is russel out and not the latter out .
I see now Max likes to give the rest of the field a jump start before he catches them all before the end of lap 1 lol
베르스타펜!!!!ㅠㅠ
did the mics sound weird for anyone else
he made a comment of the top 3 all being different teams, its all of the top 7 are different teams. great session.
OCON is and will always be a joke
K Mag gonna get fastest lap again, mark my words 😊
ALONSO!!!!
What d f was this Q3
why cant i watch this in netherlands
Alonso is gonna regret leaving Alpine big time! He shouldn't have been so impatient to get a contract for next year!
Anyone who watched practice? How is Mercs race pace?
Can anyone tell me what went wrong with Russel?
Das war extra von ver.die wollen denn Titel in Japan holen.bzw fährt er auch von 8 auf 1
all that Hamilton and Alonso need is a fast car. They are racing on another level! Those middle sector times were🔥
What a quali for alonso 👏
It was so back and forth and competitive. It's anybody's game tomorrow!
Things are getting spicy 🔥 and I like it!
If i have to sum up this qualifying in one word, its ALONSO
Whenever you dont see Verstappen in the top 5 in qualifying get scared 😈
lets hope hamilton can have a great drive tomorrow!!!
Verstappen's first aborted lap was 0.4s faster than Leclerc's pole lap in the first two sectors. I truly expect Max to lead by lap 10.
Hamilton getting hammered by his teammate once again.
pole elit
Obviously Max Verstappen's fastest car not here. No luck anymore here in Singapore. He's depend on fastest car this whole season.
Redbull delaying that victory for Suzuka
I have no clue why RB told Max to give up on the first of his 2 last laps in Q3.  Honestly something you'd expect from Ferrari.  He had 2 purple sectors at that point.
Lol Ricciardo is trash. Hope he doesn't get a drive next year. Too many have beens in the sport
Best qualifying of the season. That tells you how boring it’s been.
FINALLY SOME FEELING OF COMPETITION!!! Most entertaining Q session in a long while..
*Leclerc on pole* Leclerc happy Binotto hApPy Max Happy
Red Bull pulls a Ferrari
And then the final standing will be verstappen Hamilton and perez
Hamilton and Alonso, a pair of OG drivers for sure! Lets go!
I’m glad Max is starting back in 8th. It’ll make for a lot more interesting race (for the first few laps).
just making it known that Zhou out qualified Bottas.
That golden love helmet is so tuff 💯🔥🔥🔥
WOW!  What an amazing year of F1!
Stroll was on fire 🔥🔥🔥
I think Rebdull need more money for fuel 🤔
Max 8th to 1st????
Ferrari 1-4, a Red Bull in P2 💀
verstappen will still win tomorrow !!! qualifying doesnt matter anymore
Verstappen will still win tomorrow
Singapore is shaping up to be the race we have been looking forward to for a long time.
Red Bull taking strategy tips from Ferrari
This track just proved verstappen isn't as skilled as claimed🙄🙃👌
Pole Leclerc Max Win xD
The race will be exciting if it’s anything like q3
Do you smell that? It`s lewis`magic. We haven`t seen it so far this season but we have now.
Best quali of the year
this session had everyone on edge insane effort from lewis today
Hamilton and Alonso swung for the fences today. Incredible driving from both.
red bulls biggest mistake of the year....
Cmon Ferari we need your help to make Max win his 2nd title
Gasly on fire!!!
Alonso & Magnussen 🔥🔥
Perez just 0.022 seconds off the pole is pretty amazing, considering the fact that this track is supposed to suit the Ferrari’s more than the Red Bull’s. Hopefully he can win tomorrow so they don’t lose too much ground in the championship.
Man this Alonso guy is young and hungry for a pole.. Hope he gets a podium tomorrow
The question remains, how will Ferrari ruin Charles race tomorrow?
I wonder if "Crofty" could shout a bit more?
So..... Max will wim on sunday....😏
Pls Lewis lets win tmrrw at my home country 😭🇸🇬
The qualifying session goes to Alonso and Lewis hands down lol that’s just pure driving skill right there at their ages too
"Ricciardo and Vettel in the drop zone" That sentence has more than one meaning now
I'd like to report a crime, RB have stolen our strategy book and seen to be using it
500ths of a second separating the top 3 cars.  Awesome.  Should be an interesting race.
I did not understand what was happening to Max. He trashed his double purple sector with just a little wiggle at the middle of 3rd sector then do another push lap. But then he backed out again bcos horner said he doesn't have enough fuel. In the end he was P8.
This is one of those really dodgy qualifying sessions... It happens I suppose, but it doesn't feel satisfying to me.
Horner: “we discuss it later Max” like we don’t want to get penalized for it
Alonso magic, hauling that tractor on the top spot.
Max should had been pole
Max winning tomorrow still 😍
This is why we don’t want sprint races otherwise we wouldn’t get to see things like this. Nothing beats this for qualifying
Hamilton and Alonso will be keeping an eye on the Ferrari strategy tomorrow.
It doesnt matter if Le Clerc starts from the Pole, his own Team will throw him down and he will be happy if he can finish at 3rd Place!
Latifi has consistency
Alonso and hamilton best drivers of the qualifying
Dale Checooo 🇲🇽!!
Zhou is better than Bottas... he's been dominating him lately
Ocon 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I kinda feel like Leclerc will be overtaken on the first turn by Perez tomorrow
🔥🔥🔥
Max still getting frustrated for not getting pole after almost having championship on his side show how he wants to win each Grand Prix.
Best qualifying of the season. Right up until the last moment it was everyone's game
Hope king of singapore vettel gets into points and get DOTD in his last singapore gp
Christian Horner : box max, box box box Max: why? what the Fu , why?? Christian horner: Enough pole positions this year,enough is enough.
GO MAX!
Ricciardo = Over rated
Ferrari strategists working on how to mess up this race already 😜😜😜
who else thought that Fernando or Lewis would get Pole?
Em 10 voltas,se nada  acontecer na largada,Max estará em 2° na cola do Perez...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤝🏻. Aguardem.
I'm sad.
Sciàrl Leclérr!
What a legend Alonso. What a legend.
Looks like they’ve driving round in concrete tunnel.... boring... 😴
Man, was really rooting for that Hamilton Pole. Entertaining quali nonetheless.
Alonso what a greatest driver all time. Still the best driver Imo.
Great quali 👍
Driving styles in the last corner. Leclerc NEVER over the kurbs.
Jesus! Ocon what you doin son?
Would be a true miracle if Verstappen could still win this race after a huge mega blunder of his team. Singapore is one of the most difficult tracks to overtake, lots of corners and relatively short straights to use DRS. I hope he stays calm and collected in the first 5 laps and comes through without damage or technical woes. He is really challenged this time by a big team blunder.
ready for ferrari to throw the race again with their master🅱️lan
leclerc şu poleri yarışlarda elde etsen şampiyon sendin be !!
japan is anyway a better place to win the championship
Leclerc is better than max
Unsuspecting surprise for max 😥
Alonso is just amazing, with his earth car.
Always on pole but finish below it
Red Bull decided to do a Ferrari tactic with the fuel. He was more than a second up twice in his last runs. Both would have given him pole.
Can someone explain to me why didnt verstappen finish his lap penultimate lap? He had 2 purple sectors
Red Bull to Max on the last lap - "Max we have a new quest, start P8 and win the race, do you accept?" Max - "What the ****, Why? OK I accept"  Red Bull - " Box Box"
So verstappen abort a lap with 2 purple sector because of the team?
Would have been nice to watch this on TV like I had planned to
You all know the result when Charles is starting from P1
Can we talk how Pérez was flying on Q3 all session???
Vamos Checooo 🔥🇲🇽
What a quali
I hope Fernando will Not regret his mive to mclaren
Max getting 2 purple in 1st and 2nd section and just letting the gas off cause its too easy to win from P1 😂
Man I hope Danny Ric goes to Alpine
I think Hamilton was so confident in Q3 on softs ... (1st try 2.5sec faster than Leclerc) just too bad he didn't get P1 he deserved today
캬... 이번 Q3 졸잼이네 해밀턴 왕의귀환 하는것이냐~~~~!!
This was probably one of the Best qualifying sessions of the season!
Max campeão 2022!
RED BULL DRINK IS TOXIC , TASTES AWFUL. MADE ME ILL
6 teams in top7. That's really fun racing, where "all" runners are getting closer and closer.
Alonso's late pace at Q3 should be talked about way more..
Fernando showing his talent,, imagine with a Faster car,,he will take pole position
Hamilton and Alonso are on a whole different level!!
Don't worry Max fans, he was 9tenths up on Leclerc before abandoning in Q3. Same race formula as before. Max starts down the order.. then dominates to win by a minute
Max master 🅱lan: Let Charles and Checo take each other out in Turn 1 = Profit
Wow what a qualy, let's go Lewis 💯👍🏾
If Max survives first lap, than he will win. That man has incredible pace and talent
Max had two purples and was on target for Pole.. what if he pulled back to win the championship at hondas home ground haha because i can't see why he backed out of that flying lap to begin with
Vettel is a joke 🤣🤣🤣 4 time WC with a car that literally anyone would have won
3:57 literally scared me so much. Even on the live broadcast 😂
Can we just put some respect for Alonso and Hamilton for doing these laps not on their best form.👏
I'm going to say it again: Alpine are crazy to not offer Alonso the contract he wanted! He is still at the top of his game.
(@4:45) Verstappen backing off was the biggest mistake made today
What a banger!  Legends like Hamilton, Alonso, Verstappen plus other great pilots fighting against the clock, the walls and the fast changing track condition. Lots of teams involved too, Q3 was simply beautiful. This GP has already delivered for me, but hope it can get better tomorrow!
Looking forward to the day when these broadcasts are no longer ruined by the commentator's hysterical shouting.
Is it really fuel issue for Verstappen ?🧐
finally checo manage to adjust on the RB18 he almost got pole position
Should MAX starting from P8 winn again?
Where all the perez hater at today
Pierre Gasly going strong
GG Alpha Tauri
Go Perez🔥💪🏽
seb😢
Poor Checo,that team radio ''We thought you aborted'' made me sick,this is how the savior of last year's championship is getting treated by this old man named Marko.
Just hope that time Ferrari wouldscrew it up. But fancy Perez to win though
I love this kind of highlight.❤
Max even with a hand on the trophy still fighting for it all , flying Dutchman
amazing job from Checo that even he doesn't feel confortable with the car he ended in P2 👏🏼👏🏼
Way didn`t he finished previous lap that was also fast enough for pool position or there about?
Get ready for ferrari's drama.
I bet on Lewis for tomorrow
Ferrari e Vasco ❤
What Happened to Russell? Anyone know?
6:40 - Poor cameraman, all he wanted was to get fist bump with Charles 🤣
Redbull needs an higher budget cap for Verstappen’s fuel
love leclercs helmet design, this is looking to be a fun race for tommorrow. Excited to see Verstappen cruise through traffic up to the podium. Not sure what happened to Russel though, rough sleep last night?
FERNANDO ALONSO
The biggest surprise for me was Russell, the Mercedes wonderkin didn't make the last 10, in a vastly superior car to those who did make it.
😂😂😂
Majestic consistency from latifi there, what a driver
Dan Ricc knocked out in Q1… Norris is the same car gets to Q3… this is why a change needed to happen
Verstappen didn't want to make it too easy for him tomorrow I guess 😂
Congrats to Charles and Ferrari on the inevitable P6 tomorrow!
Great job by Mr. Consistency, always losing it in the same corner from FP1 to Q2. Gotta love tracks where real skill trumps everything else.
That girl in the haas garage is a dime.
What an amazing Qualifier
So close for Lewis! He just didn't have the grip at the end after pushing in those first few laps to the limit! It was a gamble, and it almost paid off!
Car Companies should reject electric. Its much more damaging and much more Un reliant. Bow You car companies to Your Criminal Government... You are Slaves in the LAND of SLAVELANDIA....There is NO CLIMATE CHANGE
Hamilton p1 tomorrow
Thanks liberty media you're the best 💕💕💕💕 11 you're brilliant unfortunate for 1 hopefully race weekend brilliant results 💪💪💪😇
I love the immediate trust between max and his race engineer, despite max not understanding at the time. Said "box box box" and he did it without question. Many questions later but still at the time. Just obeyed.
Lewis showed masterclass today, lets see now the ''he got the fastest car, he is nothing'' people fume once again.
Finally Brundle and Crofte are back!!
Riccardo at the back where he belongs!
fernando deserved better car, man hes flying
no problem, max stilll finna dub
LETS GO HAM!!!!!!!!
Tsunoda did well having this as his first race in singapore
Red card for team RB.
Very exciting qualifying session.
Unbiased FIA
44!!
Hamilton made this qualifying amazing
Hamilton will win tomorrow
Let's go Lewis.  Gutted for George. Let's go Mercedes.
Thank you Super Max for making it interesting 🙏🏻
Was really hoping to see lewis on pole again,  absolutely gutted it was so close.  This is coming from someone who is mainly a redbull/verstappen fan.  It just hasn't been the same this year without seeing Lewis up there fighting for pole's.  Great Qualifying session to watch.
Vettel will gain 9/11 places tomorrow again as he always do... Jees man's the overtake king
Max Verstappen win again
Looks like 1st half of season Checo is back ahuevo
Max keeping it interesting for tomorrow lol
This is about as close to a silly grid as we're ever going to get lol.
Great coverage of qualifying, as long as I turn the sound off
Don't worry Ferrari strategy will make max win
Are you ready for the Ferrari Masterstrategy?
not only ferrari has no sense of quality strategies, redbull also 😂 like a reference to a huge bizzare mistake in monaco pits this year
Would have been amazing to see perez on pole
Bro RedBull ran out of budget lap. Fr fr Max is so dominant that his team enjoy his 9 overtakes in one lap. My man Lewis for win😬
Why Verstappen aborted the first flying lap where he was all purple?
Its Hammer Time🎉
Why did Max abandon the first q3 lap with 2 purple sectors? Missed the live qualifications
Hear me out. Singapore 2017 but this time Alonso doesn't get smashed lol
Can't wait for Ferrari to mess up TMRW
41 but still a beast , Magic Alonso 👏
Why did Max abort his previous lap? he was doing so well.  Did he get greedy and want to get the last flying lap? should have finished the banker lap.
Poor camera man at the end :D
Hammertime?
🏁🇮🇹🏁🇮🇹🏁
Senna pra sempre!!!! Kd os BR?
Max isn't worried. He'll be in Leclerc's rear view end of lap 1 lol
Haas on Q2 and Mag on 8th is a joy to see
LOL
lets gooo
I'm seriously impressed how Alonso stays relevant after coming back from retirement.
Nice to see a variety of teams fighting for those top grid positions.
Why did Verstappen abort his first flying lap ??
What a fun quali. Ham and Alo's runs are particularly enjoyable to watch.
Leclerc qualifies 1st again only to chock and Verstappen winning the race
What a fun Q3. Showing the importance of practice/experience as Alonso and Ham showed their strengths in those tricky conditions before track dried enough for the rest.
Why is nobody talking about freaking K-Mag Q3 with that haas tractor
Red Bull thinking, 8th place on the grid is fine for the win, bring the lad in for a brew. 👌
getting rid of alonso will be alpines worst mistake mark my words
Flying laps in Q3 but that was so dumb to make him abort twice
Alonso tonight in another world What a performance 🎉
Alright everyone, put your guesses on how many laps before Max is leading the race
Leclerc is the first driver to take back to back Singapore GP poles
Russell may be the future but Hamilton's not done yet!
My goodness. F1 is the hottest sporting venue in earth right now. Great qualifying action today.
I want rain in the first 5 laps....or sudden downpour after the race start.
Leclerc pole,means Max is winning tomorrow
Why does the F1 community give Ocon a free pass at poor performances? I never hear a bad thing about him but always here people critique others in the mid field or back
Such a difference between the pace of Russell and Hamilton is shocking.
5:31 - this guy is the real hero here. Don´t forget he is 41 years old sitting inside an average Alpine beating kids aged 25. Amazing true talent 💪💪💪💪💪
The weather will play a part in the race lets see who can take the win when it happens
just 5 one-hundreds difference between the top 3, amazing qualifying
Petrov is faster than you
Formula en pañales
all lewis needed was just 1 more lap
Why did max bail on his second to last lap is what i didn’t understand. He was setting purples all the way
Can't wait for ricciardo to be gone!
So a max verstappen win tomorrow?
Max mau start dari batam juga besok menang
i feel like yuki is becoming one of my favourite drivers, he is seeing q2 more and more its great to see. lets hope hamilton goes to hammer time
F E R N A N D O       A L O N S O
Ok verdict is in... Tomorrow is going to be insane!  Doesn't matter who you support it is going to be nuts!
I wish every quali was wet to dry 😂
Can’t wait for tommorow race
Verstappen only drove himself in his sleep to win the championship in Singapore
Ferrari and RB giving everyone else a chance or something?
Alonso and Hamilton drivers of the session for sure. Similar session to Hungary for Verstappen, poor q3  first run by his standards then issues outside his control for the final runs. He'll be back quickly tomorrow though 😂
Alonso and Hamilton exhanging gunshots here in Singapore
What a mistake by Red Bull!
Nooo if sebs car didn't lock up would've made it to q3
Is hamilton disqualified or penalized or not?
This is why we dont want sprint races! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
Vamosss ferrarii
so hamilton gets away with breaking safety regulations and nothing is done about it what a joke yes just a piercing but rules are rules
Is a ploy to get max the championship at Japan instead of singapore because of that honda engine in that redbull
anyone can win this race for me apart from them CHEATS  redbulls
F1 Qualifying Battle 2022  Hamilton 10 - 7 Russell  Verstappen 13 - 4 Perez  Sainz 4 - 13 Leclerc Norris 15 - 2 Ricciardo Alonso 10 - 7 Ocon Gasly 11 - 6 Tsunoda Vettel 9 - 6 Stroll (Hulkenberg 1 - 1 Stroll)  Albon 14 - 2 Latifi (De Vries 1 - 0 Latifi)  Bottas 11 - 6 Zhou Schumacher 4 - 13 Magnussen  (I'm using the Qualifying Sessions instead of the Sprints)
I was so mad at Red Bull this time - outrageous call!
De Vries > Albon + Latifi;
I predict Max wins on pace anyway. Yes, Marina Bay Street Circuit is among the least overtaking-friendly circuits on paper, but so is Hungaroring (even if not as much), where he won from P10, so anything’s possible, & even more so if the race is rain-affected.
Its my birthday and im happy ferrari is on pole, its a great present!
4:06 Sounds like the call to prayer 🤲 I thought it was coming from my laptop 💻 😂
Hamilton shouldnt have gone for glory runs at the start of q3, he cooked his tyres and the grip wasnt there when the track was at its best at the end of q3. Look how leclerc and alonso approached q3, fairly slow at the start which payed dividends at the end of q3.
get ready for an amazing WET race tomorrow!! it's gonna be pure CHAOS!!
he's so close from a definte pole
I dont care who wins this, just wanna see Alonso on podium💪🏻
Lewis and Alonso made this quali session special tbh
Saludos desde San Diego California
As ussually charles lercler only pol position but race always lose 😂
But I still can't believe  if he did those final laps then why abort at the last minute only..ridiculous
Overperformance is a just a hobby for Alonso
Will Max wrap up the title this weekend?
Great job from Perez! Happy for him, Kmag and Alonso! What a Qualy!
Though luck for max, but it will make tomorrow a bit more intressting.
Alonso didnt back off in the last corners of Q3 even when he hit the wall and still gained 1 position
Alonso Masterclass 🔥
Ferrari with another Saturday victory! 🤣
Imagine the team  radios if Verstappen were driving for Ferrari. 😬😬😬
can't believe i missed this live, set my alarm woke up about abt an hr early open my TV only to find out Disney/Dish failed to come to some sort of agreement resulting in many of sports channels on their network terminated..quickly tried to enable my F1 subcr... only to be hit with some bs failed to authorize error or something..would've liked to see Hamilton on pole but none the less fantastic quali & Perez looking fresh
~What year is this? Alonso and Hamilton fight for pole?
Alonso on podium again
I guess Max got the Ferrari treatment today :D
Don’t worry Max … Ferrari’s strategy will be perfect as always 😂😂😂😂😂
Thank you𓀠
7 different teams in the top 10, been a while since we could say that! What a quali session
Wow Alonso...Wow...so Awesome
Alonso almost gets a podium. Ocon out in Q3 and guess who gets the seat next year.
Wow, what a result...
Yess Charles (Leclerc) happy to see you get 1st in qualifiers now let’s get the win tomorrow like regardless if// when you win the race tomorrow Charles everyone knows max is gonna win the championship he is well too far away to get catched up but unlucky today with radio communication today Max (Verstappen) & what happened with your Red bull car lad but none the less I  can’t wait for the race all the best all & I hope Charles & the 2 Mercedes get top 3 podium finishes 💯💯
This is very interesting.the old vets still have it in them.shame for Seb,I would have love to see him contest in Q3
I thought I was dreaming! Hamilton and Alonso fighting for pole!
Redbull doing Ferrari stuff
LETS GO YUKI
9 tenths up after sector 2, thats a very lightweight redbull ⛽️
What a great quali
Can max win the championship tomorrow?
Sir Ham did a beautiful job today!
Has Latifi given up on his F1 career after seeing DeVries in Italy???
If feel so bad for Vettel. It was just one or two minute's too early for slicks
Hands down the best quali of the season do far
This looks like it'a going to be one of the most exciting races of the year!
Someone paying Red Bull to hold off on the championship for another race.
Very impressed by Alonso. He has still got it after all these years.
Alonso's driving is just pure class, 5 tenths off pole with a lap without recharging batteries.
What are you thinking, Fernando Alonso? Lewis Hamilton was so close to getting his 1st pole position of 2022! 😤
Didn't expect to see Checo fighting for pole today, well done 🇲🇽
Pit: "box, box box" Max: "😡😭WHY!" You took too many mulligan laps Max, that's why
I'm rooting for Hamilton, he's on fire for the whole weekend
P8 to P1 coming tomorrow 🤣
Max, box box box!! Why?!! Because we want at least a semi-interesting race and therefore need you to start on P8.
Alonso classically best of the rest.
Hamilton and Alonso fighting for pole like 2007 is so refreshing. Tomorrow might actually be interesting
What happened with Russell tho? 🥲
It was nice of Max to back out on the last lap to give everyone else a chance for tomorrow. True sportmanship.
Checo is back 💪🏼
Puro Pinche Sex0 Pérez!! 😎
Red bull has finished money 😂
Best qualify Of the year ❤️❤️❤️❤️ COME ON GUYSSSS 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
alonzo......... the wily old fox
Was it intentional from RB not to give Max a full fuel on his car ? Either to not make him win the season early ( not their choice) or they want to win it in Japan for the Honda + F1 promotion there.
Very unfortunate for both of the Aston's... If Q2 were 2 minutes longer, they would have definitely both reached Q3.
"Lewis is finished" where are these haters now 🤣
It was a great qualifying session, feeling bad for Verstappen :(
Dios mediante ☀ mañana gana Hamilton p1
imagine being in top5 while your teammate can't get out of even q1... el plan show us your greatness tomorrow we need a last win from you till you get to amr
Still waiting for hamilton's first pole and win in 2022. And this qualifying was so close to sticking it on pole just 5 hundreths of a second
Hamilton might be back here
Budget cap hitting RBR really hard.
Hands down one of the most exciting qualifying sessions of the season!
What a disaster for RB when Max needed to pull out while pole is within his grasp.
Lewis showing hes a frickin Beast
Russel would have taken pole if his car didn't have the problem it did. Hamilton's complete lack of talent and skill resulted in him making mistakes on his final lap that Russell would have never made. Marc missed out on pole today due to Hamiltons inability to drive anything but a rocketship with autopilot and the fact that Rusell, their world class driver, had problems out of his control.
One of the best qualis I've watched in a while
Simply the best qualifying session of the season.
For those who want to know: Ocon said he had no brakes, thats why he was disqualified.
Max still win tomorrow
What an amazing qualifying session!
Why did max give up on his 2nd to last lap?
Hey Goatifi why don’t you just quit already?  Or is Red Bull still paying you as their 3rd driver?
Alonso and Max were just insane this quali! Great job by both drivers
How on earth did Max end up P8???
Red Bull cutting costs, those fuel prices, ehhhh
With the idiotic prices in fuel because of Biden and the other EU idiots  the budget cap came into play for Red Bull and they had to abort the lap.......
Leclerc is once again in the pole position. Ferrari's team will have to work hard the whole night to fail him to win the race.
Why??? Does it even matter..b
Superb job from Alonso in Q3
Ricciardo is a great driver but I wish he could do better. if Lando can do better than him I would would expect more pace.
RB Bottled it like prime Ferrari
max will just win it from 8th
We got 7 different teams in top 8 its amazing best qualifying so far this season.
You can say what you want but somehow Perez is always there when Red Bull needs him the most
Redbull did a Ferrari
McLaren made a mess of quali for Riccardo. Sending him out on softs just to bring him straight back in for inters and send him straight back out to run into lots of traffic. Ridiculous calls from the team
Guys please upload a longer video from next time, love every bit of f1. ❤
So happy Lulu didnt got pole😅 shake of Max he would have got pole by over more than 1 sec. But atleast he has a challenge noe for tomorrow
3 different teams with very different concepts within half a tenth of each other
Goatifi Very consistent yes
Man, I really wish Seb's soft tyre gamble had work. I hope the Lion of Singapore would get his last podium tomorrow somehow.
Charles Leclerc Mickey Mouse pole
Congrats to Max on the win!
Can't wait for Sunday's race
No worries, Verstappen will still win the race anyway 🤣🤣🤣
i cant believe that i was there during practice 3 and quali. my very first time seeing f1 cars with my own two eyes, and at my home gp too! what a way to end qualifying in singapore 🇸🇬
To only be 0.5seconds off pole in a midfield car is insane. Alonso never left his prime. King of Singapore <3 GOAT!
Mr Saturday didn't make it to Q3. Crofty and brundle almost want to cry
Again, Hamilton tantrums swept under the carpet (not shown), while Max's tantrums get repeated 4 times on the live stream. What's special about Lewis that they are super protective at him?
Congrats max for winning tommorow
That top 3 is so close race will be very interesting
Bad luck for Max but lets see... he will probably claim either P1 eller P2 tomorrow. But man I would love to see them pour some water on the track in all corners from now on... in every single race. This is so much more fun to watch.
the back and forth pole tho 🔥🔥🔥
Whoa
George 😭😭😭
Legend 💛💜️
David Croft needs to chill a bit.
Max crying is music 🎶  to ears
Verstappen had 2 purple sectors and backed up for another flying lap. 💀😭
Max pov:I don t car bcs I ll win
YUKI SAN!!! Lesssgooo! AAAAHHH that qualifying had me holding onto my seat
WE ARE BACK BOYSSS
Superb showing from LeClerc yet again, but I really thought Hamilton had pole for the taking.  What on Earth happened to Russell?
I like new alpha Tauri nose
Let's Go Checo!!
Best Qualifying Session of the year. Singapore always has something special to give.
Insane qualification for the first time of the year. Lewis finally showing who is the real player at mercedes. Hope that leclrec doesn't run in a wall tomorrow imola style and france style just to get 0.000001 better lap time.
Crystappen
This session just reiterates the fact that F1 is much more exciting and thrilling when Lewis Hamilton is back fighting at the top🔥
Hi
i like what i see
Kwalifikacje
AAAA LEWIS ALMOST 🤏 LET'S GET THEM TOMORROW 💜🐐
Double AT q3!!! I was so hyped to see it
After a long long time for this circuit, we're back again
YUKI DID THAT!!! first time racing in singapore and making it to q3! proud.
magnussen in q3 is his biggest achievement
6:21 RedBull gone clown 🤡
Hamilton and Alonso got me at the edge of my seat, that was fantastic ❤
See, You want to destroy this amazing qualies with sprints the next day  🧐
Verstappen starting from p8 on a circuit on which it is incredibly difficult to overtake. Ultimate opportunity for Ferrari to win the race, with Leclerc starting from Pole. We all know what that means...
And that's why quali on streets are way better than sprints... rooting for checo!!!
The best qualifying for this season!
Will this be Hungary all over again that’s the question
I would have loved seeing Hamilton on Pole! Incredible pace, especially in comparison to Russell.
give alonso a race winning car...he is still very much in his prime....I want rain tomorrow so then we will see Alonso winning for sure
most intense quali ive ever witness so far
This qualifying shows us how important is experience here
Those Flying laps by Lewis 🐐🔥🔥🔥🔥
ESPN did not show this in North America for some reason. Thank you for the highlights!
I wonder if Verstappen is going to start from P20 due to not enough fuel... Anyhow, it's going to be undoubtedly an intriguing GP!
q2 poor vettel
Meanwhile, Ferrari strategists are devising a new strategy to throw the win tomorrow.
I would rather have Verstappen start eighth than last
Can I just say that this year's grid has been fairly unpredictable? Sure, the top three teams are still the top three teams, but everyone else has been bouncing around a lot, you never know for sure who will qualify and finish where. Sometimes we get a Williams in Q3, sometimes we lose a McLaren in Q1. And changing conditions make it even less predictable. Who would've expected both AlphaTauris in Q3 today, while one of the Alpines gets eliminated in Q1?
Redbull shot themselves into their own leg.
KMag is absolutely exceptional in Singapore. Q3 in a Haas just wasn't on, but he really does love that track
Now the Ferrari without Yellow Is strange After 3 weeks
IF MAX WINS TMWR HE THE GOAT
LETS GO LEWIS
Verstappen humiliated to 8th🤣🤣🤣, brilliant lap from Hamilton!👏👏👏
Hamilton was soo close!!
Wow wow 🤯 what a quali If you wonder, Max didn't have enough fuel in the end
You could feel the tension when lewis was soooo close
Redbull dont have the budget to fuel his car
Race day tomorrow gonna go hard💀💀
AFTER 3 YEARS AGO CHARLES LECLERC BACK POLE POSITION 🎉🎉🎉
Sebastian Vettel Fans throughout the Quali Session:  Q3 (Less than a minute): COME ON SEB! COME ON! ..... YESSS!!!  Q2: SEB COME ON CROSS THE LINE! NOOOOOOOOOOO
We really need better onboard cameras, they make F1 look so unbelievably slow. Great quali though.
Alonso was on fire 🔥
I realy thought this was the year of Leclerc
What happened with Max ? Why he didn’t finish lap ?
Fuel
Ferrari of the day: Red Bull
This was fantastically entertaining but what is annoying me is that Lewis has to go to stewards for a flipping nose stud  I’m not a Lewis fan but it’s just dumb
RBR needs Honda to keep producing their engines. They sabotaged poor Max so he can win his 2nd wdc in Japan. That is the only obvious explanation.. 😂
Amazing Quali. One of the best this season. Up There with Saudi and Hungary
This was a very cool quali to see. It was so exciting to see purples coming from Max, Checo, Lewis, Alonso, Charles, and even Norris. I didn't know what to expect. Max aborting the final lap was odd but I heard that it was they'd run out of fuel and not have enough for a sample resulting in a DSQ.
We need more wet Qualyfying.
Another poor start from Checo and Ferrari doing Ferrari things is all that stands between Hamilton keeping his record going…
Fok we luck like a bunch of happy man..
Hamilton and Fernando were OP today.
Come on Hamilton!
The memes that popped up extremely quickly kinda spoiled it for me
Yes.... come on Alonso the podium is waiting for you
Lat, Lat, Lat, Super Lat Lat, Super Super Lat, Lat, Lat
Seb take our energy!
What a great qually, max has to do a masterclass tomorrow!
Gutted for seb . His last qualifying in Singapore and this happens
I get that Max couldn’t continue because he had barely no fuel and that’s partly why the last sectors were so quick but it would have been nice seeing how fast that lap would have been.
Everyone expecting max-imum rain, except Max. 😙
He was mere 9 tenths off -From getting into Q2? -No. From not being last 🤯🤯
Hamilton will show them who's king
Alonso getting P1 twice in Q3 was so beautiful, 0.7s clear of Norris too
Leclerc on pole for the 9th time this season....we all know what that means. Another verstappen win.
Best qualifying round of the year.
Absolutely fascinating qualifying! Verstappen’s feedback at the end was hilarious 😂
i am in the hospital now because this quali was........
