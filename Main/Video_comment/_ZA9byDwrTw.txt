Who’s here when Ronaldo is at al nassr
W timestamps
“One of the best centre-backs in the game”  Tom you’ve only used him for 3 games, stop lying mate
Aj3 that happened to aj2 or aj1
The video is laggy
End of fifa 21: 99 ronaldo, 14 squads, 3 mil Start of fifa 22: 92 ronaldo, 26 squads, 2.4 million Makes sense🤣
The face drop when he said jorginio
stopped watching fifa content about 6 months ago, good to see that Andy hasn't had a haircut since i left
Tom: Koscielny is one of the best centre backs I've played with this year. Also Tom: Games Played with him : *3*
3:38 start
Thanks for the video
The  hair atypically warm because plasterboard intraspecifically trust over a hateful bathtub. ignorant, threatening lan
Tom saying koshelney smashed it for him yet he played only 2 games? Moron as usual
How long till the Messi showdown
Ronaldo did it so Man U phoned up and said wow we will have him and that’s it
Oh- oh my no

Am I the only one that doesnt like R9s, peles and ronaldinhos cards?  (im a div3 player if needed) Cant win a single match they feel really slow for some reason but thats probably fifa being retarded  deleted fifa 21 because of this bs
The seemly cough subjectively muddle because wallet comparatively destroy into a lazy cockroach. noxious, scrawny alto
Reccomended after their defeat to YB.
Anyone here after ,their defeat to young boys?
“I love this card” has 3 games played
Deadset the 150 dislikes are city fans. (The amount of fans they actually have)
Messi sbsd now!!!
I do enjoy a squad builder showdown every now and then
I am not a memeulous but I somehow got this
youve bottled it youve got odegaard  😂
Andy should actualy do a podcast it would be entertaining
man scores a tap in and a goal and now hes back at 99?
I love this card hesays, he has used him for 3 games
Messi sbc next vid boys
25k likes has been hit lets wait for the messi sbsd!!
Why don’t they put Lukaku with Chelsea but Ronaldo with United?
25k? Well it’s happened
Just hit 25k 😂😂😂😂
Lol the Messi is here  It’s 25k likes
Gigs Gullit club? Nah it’s the naingolan gang
I only spent 37k on the ronaldo sbc and I kept on doing 85 x 10 to get the players I needed using the 85 x 10 previous players to do the next one keeping a few players every time but it did take about 5-6 hours
It hit 25K😂
new rule, u always put “the 4th pick” and the other player chooses before to switch that 4th pick out with another pick
Uh oh good luck we passed 25k🤣
How did u get that icon kit
Andy just rinse and repeat 85x 10s for messi
Whos here after Ronaldo scored twice on his debut, absolute scenes
I did a tons of 85+ sbc for prime moments ronaldo.
And love your videos
I want to see the Messi agen plz
Please make tha highlight video of the stats contain clips from the sats on screen! LIKE IT!!!
I was doing the ronaldo sbc and got 1/4 of the way through then packed his 99 from an 85 x 10 😂😂
Did anyone else realise that Andy guessed his formation but didn’t realise
Sub to Aj3
Ronaldo is cracked
I think it is safe to say most of us would love a stat video Andy!
"One of the best CB every used in a game" - Tom Played with him 3 games
I'll do you one better Andy you should also upload the video of the 15 hours it takes you to finish all the SBCs 😂
with these 85x10 packs that SBC Messi should be light work
Mendy plays for Prison F.C now
I’d love to see a video on all the stats from this years SBSD’s! Messi is very easy to do too, it’s only 10 squads and if you just sit and spam the 85+ x10 packs you can do it easily 😉, that’s how I did Messi and he is incredible in game too
No excuse now with this 85x10 farm, we want to see a Pele PIM showdown!
Tom “one of the best CB in the game for me” only played 3 games
Cost me nothing to do that Ronaldo card because I did 50 85x 10 packs did all the squads for nothing
Aj should do the rule team takedown do it’s boring discarding bronzes
Futcrunch needs to be a guest on Fifa 22
2k more likes to go Andy (20k likes cause you said that first)
Schmeichel’s in your head, in my goal and in your attack. -Capgun Tom 2021
woow
End of era kante
I love seeing the clock in andy’s room just to see how much time it takes to record because of how much they waffle
Do the stat video But on the second channel
MESSI
5kqjyana sf
Messi x Ronaldo SBSD??? 👀
Isn't that hilarious that tom bought a Christinsen while he already had it , but he did not see it
“I love this card” 3 games
You spent 3 mill on Ronaldo whilst I spent nothing and spammed 85+ 10s lmao
Viva Ronaldo
What about we see the first 2 player squad builder showdown with Ronaldo and Messi 99 rated
Big up the lads!
Do the SBC Andy!
Question is, who’s better Andy, ronaldo at city or united?
About the roundup    CONTENT!!!!
PLAY THE CLIP
He was done moving them that quick and you dont go ST? Rigged.
Longtime viewer first time commenter. Where did you get that clock in the background?
Wait, I cudda sworn he was a Man City player in your other video :p
if there’s a tie you both discard as many goals there were
Andy before you stop making videos on fifa 21 you should do a squad builder showdown with one of the sidemen
You should do a dynamic duo squad builder showdown with 2 players just feel like it would be a fun video concept
SBSD against SBSData!?!?
Andy what we would love to see is an sbsd on 99 futties kante vs Itani for the culture
Andy lad do a squad builder showdown with duttinho mate
PSG MESSI. pls pls pls. The two goats in SBSD will be insane.
85+ x10 are too good ive grinded them and got messi and ronaldo from it
Congrats on 1.6 million subs
so obvious picks for aj3
Watching sbsd at 3am while eating an apple its 😘
Cost me 85x10s 😂😂
andy,he is scouse,BUT WHERE IS HIS ACCENT
You should do a video on fifa bingo with 30 85x10s
Andy you should get futcrunch on the channel
Tom scrolling past Christensen in his club to put him in the squad as a concept 😂😂
Do 99 kante!!!!
It’s funny to me Andy says tom has that “stupid rule” that you discard the player you wanted not the one you play with yet he’s the only one with a squad building series that has a different rule.
S B S D YES YES YES YES YESSSS
Chat what does aj stream on
Real Madrid get a penalty Ronald takes it ronaldoooooo wins it
AJ heart my comment because I liked your video😳
Why there Is no 99 kante sbsd w itani!?!
But Tom isn’t a Man U fan he doesn’t watch football
Repeat that 85+ SBC for a bit and you'll have messi in no time!
25k likes only?  Fifa community *hold my beer*
Him only cost 1.3 million
What timing for this episode man !
James Rodriguez, more like CAMes Rodriguez
Sorry to Jack54 i love 7ms but SBSD will never get boring just because you dont upload it every day. Without the doubt, best fifa series, watching it since i was 15
Andy mate your beautiful just sat here smoking a joint hoping for something to watch and see you’ve uploaded this such a gem
Tom: Best CB I've used in the game  (3 games played)
Tom and his stinky squads in September, at least Andy was willing to put up R9 lol
Did he call Kamara camera?😂
We don’t want Messi we want LEFT BACK (kante)
best fifa series
I have Juventus 99 CR7 but im banned until fifa 22 releases so I deleted the game
Boring cap gun Tom back again
Please do the sbsd stats review at the end of the year
Love the videos Andy and the dog very cute 🥰
Love your videos Andy love the dog as well very cute 🥺
It’s SBS not SBC
I hate that ginger
Defo do 2 videos of best and worst moments of squad builder showdown like 30+ mins each would be a great way to see out fifa 21
the rule that tom has isn't stupid it's how it should be for sbsd where even if your player gets guessed you still could lose that player in the discard or else the discards are pointless because you're trying to guess their players to make their squad weaker but that also helps out the player that loses as they've got less to lose
This series is goated
Aj3 i have a brilliant idea for squid battles why don’t u add there player for substitute and when someone loses they pick 1 player  out of 3 but randomly in the match u can substitute but the same rules for squid battles stay if some scored 2 goals the opponent discards 2 players and u say the poissons and that’s my idea
Cool video
Its Bruno fernandes birthday
end of an era kante?
Hello !
Can you do a final sbsd where every goal equals one discard
Andy, do more of the prank squad builder showdown
Early gang
Tom is the worded guest that comes on to be fair but was a good video
Has anyone else noticed that Tom acts a lot different with Andy than with anyone else he records with.
Just do the 85x10 repeatable SBC. It took me 45 minutes to get Messi. Not a big deal.
I just finished this SBC Ronaldo and it took so long
Hello
a 99 rated card and tom comes in with the deadest of cards why doesn't he realize its September
I have been waiting so long for these checking every day
can you do 99 CAM messi squad builder showdown?
17:20 I’m dead
I turned on my computer and saw Andy posted the mancity Ronald sbsd and shouted mug
Where is the GOAT Itani? He hasnt been on in like 4 months.
I know this ain't something to be impressed about, but the fact that they both said *"He's Allan"* at the same time is impressive to me, like some Great Minds Think Alike sh*t.
You can use my account if you want to do the messi :) Lets get another episode!
Before I watched the video, i predicted that andy is gonna pick a formation with 2 strikers and put r9 into his squad. Its just too obvious andy 😂
I have just realized tom’s shirt
futties messi is still better, great video though
Where is the Kante video with Itani
messi is easy now bc of 85x10
Love your videos Andy
I don't get how Tom has got any subs. My man has no charisma at all. While saying he was very excited for the CR7 signing being a ManU fan, his expression barely changed. Not that I wish someone ill but I'm genuinely confused how he has got an audience. Love SBSD but really struggle to watch them with Tom.
"that absolute demon Mendy" ... you weren't wrong andy
To be fair to Tom, he puts out 4-5 Team Takedowns a week, whereas Andy has a SBSD a week. If Andy makes as many videos as Tom then the numbers in discards equal out
I don't like messi's card that much.. sorry to be that guy i want to love him but i just dont lol, he'll be replaced with the new ben yedder most likely
17:19 what a prat
3 goats
Absolutely do a video for all the stat of the days!!
where is the 99 kante vid with Itani?
Can u do another sbsd with w2s
When will be seeing fifa 22 sbsd?
This is gonna be a good video I can already tell!!!
ANDY EVERY VIDEO: who do i have in my club oh yeah Rodriguez I'll have him🤣🤣
AJ3 if you like this comment I won't use meta cards next year
How many goals do you think Ronaldo will score this season
Stop taking 5 minutes to get into it
Do the video about the SBSD stats imo
Do a squad builder showdown with Aa9skillz
I swear I would just write Lloris every time I was on this series. The amount of times he ends up in squads is insane
Just finished watching the team take down and boom SBSD is out!
Where is 99 kante
Smash that like button for Messi. Just watching Andy building the squads will be worth it!
Absolutely buzzing for fifa 22 and these sbsd
Yh that stats vid sounds very interesting please do that

We can forgive Andy now that he’s fixed the problem from the last video 👍
