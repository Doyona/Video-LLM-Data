WAGAI WEHH ..... J OLAM & MELANESIA BROS  GO TIGERS
For those who love NRL 2024, the cryptocurrency $YGG [YGG Coin] is currently going UP and could have LIMITLESS money for all people here RIGHT NOW!
Olam has made the right choice linking up with Api and the Tigers. He's definitely shining as he should be in his full potential.
Tigers will win and they will win in 2024 seassion. If thats the truth all of you owe me a clap?hahaha go tigers support from papua new guinea
Tigers will go to grand final in 2024
Jesus is coming back everyone. Jesus says that he is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No man comes to the father but through him. Make sure to put your faith in him as he is the only one who can save us from sin and its consequences.
Olam you are the best,perform well that Melbourne will regret
GO THE ⚫️⚪️🟠
I’m sure bellyache knew what he was doing to let Olam go but man it hurts to see him in another jersey
Sii 🥴
Sharks were abject! 😂
always straight magic out at Leichhardt 🔥
Go Olam.... Nice one tigers. 🎉
Api Olam Bula combo..Greatest win ..congrats BENJI
Love this...❤
Benji put a good team together for sure. I hooe the winning streak continues. Api, and his backs are on fire.
Olam giving the backs boost in confidence is frightening. Well done Tigers 🎉
🔥
Team West Tiger 🐅 is back, you'll watch out the hunting season just got started ❤❤🎉
Hooligans all of them!!!!
1 LIKE = 1 PUSHUP
The hhh
Dude in the thumbnail looks like Katt Williams. I thought Slickback was on the rugby field now 😭
❤
Use Olam when the game is a MUST WIN ❤🇵🇬
Olam looks and built like a TIGER! LETS GO BOYS!
Really impressed with the Tigers pack. Stefano's best game in awhile. Pole is such a busy player, he always get stuck in. Seyfarth and Fainu bringing that energy from the bench. Provided a great platform for Api to work his magic. Shout out to the crowd as well! Amazing atmosphere!
Wow
Great win Tigers ❤ team Benji
Was a storm fan, now am tigers fan 🎉 lessgoo Olam ❤🇵🇬
Your passion shines through every video
Your creativity always leaves me inspired

The sharks just thought they could just turn up and win, well done Tigers!

API mean as with ball in hand, he was solid in a 6 jersey aswell!!!
I'm want to watches live ,how will I watches life
Former players like benzi he's best five eight I believe tigers will be ok this season 🐯🐯🐯🐯🐯
Lessgoo Juzzy! 💯🐯
Way to go Tigers, up the wahs.
Despite the result, Nicho Hynes will still 6 points towards his dally m table
No highlights for the Sharks poor form
Good one tigers you deserve it..olam we are proud of you
Well done Benji
Olam the man!!!!
corasell and the ref need glasses ..there was a couple of forward passes thrown ....lol 😂 😂.
Api carrying the tigers on his shoulders watta beast
Api was outstanding.
Melanesian brotherhood and combination is what I see is going to be the driving force behind tigers success this year 2024
Im a roosters fan but its so satisfying seeing tigers win 🎉🎉api bula olam lessgooo
Well done Tigers, a good foundation to build on, all the best for the rest of the season.
Go  Olam & the Tigers..PNG is behind you guys
Lols
Olam u beauty 🇵🇬
What a win congrats tiger an Benji
Congrats tigers
Koroisau has the best tackling technique in the game . Cuts players in half
Congrats to Benji and the boys
API is unarguably the best 9 in the game ,
Leichhardt games should only be played on a Sunday afternoon
Brings back the memories of the Balman Tigers 🎉❤
Tigers: we are going for the wooden spoon again. Sharks: we want to be a contender.
Tigers gonna go all the way
Aidan Sezar was a great buy for the Tigers also. A solid consistent halfback
I'm fn roaring & tweetingml all morning lets go tigers & Maggies ❤
Respect, Respect, Respect. With you Tigers
What a fantastic team win. Everyone did their job; Benji, the forwards defense, the backs working as one and of course Api directing the boys from the ruck.  After such a long drought this is enough to bring a tear to the eye of this long suffering Wests-Tigers supporter.  Getting rid of those two muppets from head office is already starting to pay off.
Galvn has really added that sharpness to the team he's a first grader that's for sure
GO THE TIGERS
Coach keep this team sheet for next week games... Congratulations 👍🎇💯❤️
Congrats tigers.. congrats matua Benji
So awesome well done tigers
Api for PM.
“The Benji era starts a week late” great call Vossy 👍
Well done tigers, well done👏
Good to see olam performing well for tigers.!!im not a tiger fans but I’m happy they won..congrats tigers
Did not see that coming. Well played Tigers.
Well done Benjie and the tigers
good win tigers
Now where are the trolls from last week calling for Benji's head???
Tigers are on the up, as long as the new board stays out of it
Nico Hynes - 3pts
Don't get too excited with a win like this, more games to come and  it's the last game of the season that is the main one.
Happy for benji
How good are the crowds at the moment full houses all over the place
Hynes most overated half in the game
Go olam! Go tigers! 💯
Wow did not see that result at all
As long as one of PNG's own son JO play with Tiger we will support tiger. Well done tiger boys. We believe in you boys, play like this all through out this season. Play with patient and confidence. If others can make it to the final, you can do as well. Go JO🇵🇬
Keep up with the momentum into the season..go Tigers..
Great to see!!
Embarrassing sharks
1:03 "Papali'he" this year is it?
WELL-DONE TIGERS..
No nikora for the sharks ??
Pacific racing collect! 🤑
Don't like it being a Sharks supporter but very good win by the tigers some kind of a performance
Rip everyones multis
Oh dam, who are the journos going to slag off now?
Go Olam and West Tigers...PNG is with You...still the best son of PNG..thank You West Tigers..Keep up the winning spirit..🇵🇬❤️🙏💪
Go Olam
Wow…!!
I have faith the tigers either be top 8 or maybe even get 9th place
Olam you are the best,perform well that Melbourne will regret
Nice Benji keep at it maori,  even if yous take an L during the season keep your boys turning up. Nice win tigers
I can't wait for Big will to roast ole mate who had no coaching experience that was giving Benji a hardtime only 1 game into his coaching career
I'm a shark fan but I'm gonna give credits to the Tigers this time cause they not only show their skills off tonight but they for once actually played with confidence.  Thia might've convinced me they could make it top eight. Can't wait for the rematch again. We'll be ready the next time.
Great to see a fan base getting out there to support their team that’s been under the pump. Good for benji
Not a tigers supporter but good solid win . Only if L.Mitchell could play like bula 😅
SSY for Tigers 2024
Strong team performance
from a bunnies supporter.. up the tigers!
You beauty
Well done Juzzy 🙌🏾🇵🇬
Api, Bula & Olam 🔥 Love seeing the brotherhood tearing it up on the footy field 🖤💯 Melanesia Stand up 🇫🇯🇵🇬
That's what we like
Olam looks and built like a TIGER! LETS GO BOYS!
❤❤
Go Tigers
Unbelievable
Good win lads, onto next week
The issue for the tigers this year won't be there attack it will still be their defense.
Good stuff tigers !!!!
Really impressed with the Tigers pack. Stefano's best game in awhile. Pole is such a busy player, he always get stuck in. Seyfarth and Fainu bringing that energy from the bench. Provided a great platform for Api to work his magic. Shout out to the crowd as well! Amazing atmosphere!
Olam was outstanding in his first outing for tigers, so does Api and Bula. 🐅 🐯
Api, Bula, Olam  🇵🇬 🇫🇯  Best game ever  Go Tigers 🐅
Api is arguably the best no.9 in the comp right now. 🔥🔥
I’m sure bellyache knew what he was doing to let Olam go but man it hurts to see him in another jersey
Love the look of Olam, API, Bula giving the Melanesian flair ❤️‍🔥
Round 3 sucks
See you in the finals. Traffic boys, well done.
Sermon of the day. 'Whoever wants it most'.
Nice to see the tigers playing well...
Good for Benji!
Olam still killing it happy for that fella mans a beast 💯
see if they put in the effort tigers can win games, it isn't always about the coach. the players have to show up and play
Awesome win go Tigers 👏👏👏👏👏
Well done Tigers 👍
Sisa the best half back for the Tigers..He must wear the 7 jersey for ever....
My boi Juzzy bringing good vibes for the boys 🤝
Go tigers
Ya know what? It's actually nice to see the Tigers win for a change. They genuinely worked hard for this & thoroughly deserved it. Well done. Full praise for a more than well earned win. Based on this performance, it would actually be good to see them go all the way to the finals.
Hopefully this will silence that ridiculous talk from the media about sacking Benji after only one game into his coaching career.
Toby Rudolph is a waste of space send him to the reserves..he's a big goofball
Well that was a big turn up for the books. Didn't expect that. Have to give them 👍👍👍for that performance.
Sharks smashed by the wooden spooners
Olam Pawa house
Well done mate. 👏 keep this 👌 all the way.
🐅
How good is it to see the tigers and dogs have big wins on the same night. Ahhhhh. Takes me back to the good old days 😂
I'm glad the average nrl person is waking up to the matchfixing in the nrl..
Fantastic 2 see Tigers win, after such hard times.
Time to buy grand final tickets now as a West tigers fan. No chance they don't make it now
Great win for the Tigers team, fans and Benji. Hopefully the media will concentrate on the game and not Benji's alarm clock
Olam looks dreaded tonight. Such an awesome effort! 😍🥰On his hard run
Api is an MVP
Nice one Tigers and a great debute for Olam.🫡😁
The human brick 🇵🇬🇵🇬 # Go Tigers
More games need to be played at suburban grounds, better atmosphere.
Let’s go tigers
Benji you can bring the Tigers into the finals 2024...this game was the best game of the Tigers...
Tiges big efforts in A & D ,top team work, Api gave heaps,& th 13 amongst best,beaut crowd  scenes
Good start to the year for the tigers now they can set a platform.
Api is the man. He stood out all through
Api is killing it 🔥🔥🔥 congrats to benji on a win as coach
So happy for the Tigers !
That was a very good win. They defended well. I see some good combination developing in this Tiger's team. Hope they build this culture of winning to instill belief in these young players.
Fox League crying right now 😂 they can't complain and trash on the Tigers.
Not really a shock loss it’s only the sharks
Olam is perfect for this squad, but they still lose Tupou next year.
It's only one game but if Tigers manage to keep winning like this then they're fixed.
Thank you Olam!
Good to have you back! Justin Olam
Api Olam Bula combo..Greatest win ..congrats BENJI
PNG with you Justin Olam ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ West Tigers up💪💪💪💪💪
Olam giving the backs boost in confidence is frightening. Well done Tigers 🎉
Sharks most overrated team in the comp
Olam did it again.
OLAM awesome👌
It's the Melanesian show.🇫🇯🇵🇬🐯
About time Talakai shifts to forward/interchange position and make way for Kayal Iro.
This is like a sharks performance from the 90s 😅
They deserve that win 🔥🔥🔥
Usually uncompetetive games are boring but it's the Tigers so you never know what might happen. Keeps things a little interesting
The human brick gave confidence
Up the tigers
Benji should post a picture of himself in his office with a sleeping bag.
Hellova of a Tigers Debut for my boy Juzzy.
What a win 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 What are they gonna say about not a 24/7 coach now
My Sharks don't deserve the premiership after that GG Tigers 🐅
yeah tigers!! love to see em win
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Too many errors for the Sharks
Enjoy the win but don’t get too excited though because the Cowboys are gonna win the premiership 🤠
First? And go the stormzzzz
First🎉
Great win lads ❤
