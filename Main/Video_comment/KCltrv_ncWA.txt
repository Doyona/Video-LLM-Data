Where's Hank?
Did you name the van yet?  How about Buffy? I thought about it in the last episode when you called the buffalo that! 😀
Moose is gorgeous! 💖🐾
この動画で貴方達が親子というのが分かりました 応援してます🎉 JAPANから😊
Your son is doing something amazing. Appreciate you sharing his story.
Hey there ladybug greetings from Louisville Kentucky! My only concern about the bunker area is the fuel oil and other contaminants that have leaked into the soil. You may want to check with your local extension office if there is one there or an EPA official to see how much soil that needs to be removed to make it safe for storage or habitation or whatever reason you need it to be. Because as of now it's probably a hazard more than a help. It could simply be fixed by removing 4 to 6 in of the current soil or possibly a few more than that but it definitely is something that I would encourage you to consider before you put anything in there that you don't want contaminated because as it stands now there's a hazard and I'm only saying this because I absolutely love this channel I'm a new subscriber and I have been binging and binging and loving and loving all the content I would never want anyone to incur sickness or anything from something that could just be a little bit more Sweat Equity as far as possibly digging those few inches out can help with. I'm certainly not the authority and I don't know the answer to how much did you get out but I know there has to be some removal as far as fuel and oil spilling into soil. And thank you ladybug so much for all your beautiful footage and I love seeing a woman felling trees building cabins and treating the land with love and living in a sustainable manner. God bless you and your entire family can't wait till the next episode❤❤❤
The screen on the vardo will not keep Big Foot out.  LOL!!!
My husband and I had high desert property and it came with the old trailer and I went to clean out the closet.  A pack rat was eye to eye with me! I screamed and he screamed we both ran out of the trailer! Never saw him again! My kiddos and husband still laugh about it! 🙄
That opening scene, fantastic mountains
I truly love your videos 😍 Y'all make a great team together 🙌💯❤️ Brilliant ❤️
Did the squirrels come in through the stove pipe?
Can't believe zero flats😊
That was some of the most beautiful scenery I’ve ever seen
I love the curved roof design it really works
Neat
how did the squirrels get in?
Let’s try this again. I just had a whole paragraph deleted somehow and now I have to redo it and I don’t think I can do it the way I did it before but this is what I feel. I thank God a million times for the Whipple family. Brooke Whipple has been, such an encouragement to me even though I’m going through several terminal illnesses. I love all of her videos. I love her husband Dave, her 🎉son Mickey (what a great radio voice!), her daughter Belle, and of course her pets. One of my favorite videos was when she and Dave met with Jim 🎉🎉🎉😢and Tori Baird. Now that the Bairds have a family, I think it would be great if they would all meet up together in some type of a reunion that would be great!  May God continue to bless these families I love them so much!
How many properties do you have?
What if you turn the concrete spot into a full outdoor kitchen prep area for family gatherings or something? Break the walls down about halfway, build a roof, and maybe some wooden shutters to lock it all up when it's not in use? Can use it for storage the rest of the time maybe? Idk. Awesome luck that your son is into homesteading like you guys. Congrats!
❤ glad you made it safe and sound ❤
You guys would enjoy Truck House Life with Timmy Johnson! At least I think you would.  😅 He's been in Alaska over 20 years.
Есть электрические картины, маты на пол и Эл. Грелки. При такой температуре спать невозможно.Вы рискуете замёрзнуть. Вам срочно нужно приобрести Эл. Мат на пол😅
I hate all rodents, including the cute ones with fuzzy tails like squirrels.   They are great at making a mess.
Super cool...
At least a squach didn't take a dump in there!! Lol
At least a squach didn't take a dump in there!! Lol
At least a squach didn't take a dump in there!! Lol
Never easy when they leave home .  Great camper , has one of the best luxury items , a bed   !  Stove is a open door to some . Had bats use mine to get in a couple times ! Have learned to close it off tight now when we leave.  The cement building could be a great meat smoker  or a steam house I guess .
The bunker would make a nice outdoor garden space or greenhouse
I use that block building for storage or a work shop and storage space when you get the time to put a roof on it and doors windows
Moose is just the cutest companion ever! ❤
On the bunker, if you could give it a squirrel-proof roof and bear-resistant doors, and you could use it to store anything that shouldn't be left in the cabins when you go away for the season, along with anything else longer-term storage that you want to keep out of the weather.  If it would fit, maybe even the motorcycle.
Lives in the forest and complains about how dirty everything is. You should clean the forest.
Ok, l have an idea for the bunker. You know how some old German houses were kinda built on top of a smaller looking building. The barn was on the bottom and the living quarters were on the top. You could also cover the cinder block with stucco that looks old world. Yah, buddy a new project....
DaWoof is a lady in Fur❤ Love her 😢.  Thank You for sharing her with us … ❤
put a roof on it and store vehicles as a garage, haunted bed and breakfast?
Maybe you could get one of the walls with the openings cut open more  all a roof and make it à place to store your tools or machines once the stink is out of the floors to keep them out of the elements.
Ohhhh myyyy goodness😳😳 I follow your son’s channel, he’s got the most amazing voice..😁🤗
Buenas.tardes desde costa rica
Great videos!  Like Micks videos as well!!  Great job parenting 👍  Just curious are you leaving the Vardo in Alaska when you return home?  Seems like the weather would be hard on it!
Good on you two for not being helicopter parents, especially in this particular scenario to where this truly is your lane!  Man that kid is going to learn so much over the next few years💪
HELLO:
Did the stove not work out or was that only for winter
I just started watching, im confused. You took the Vardo to AK in another show. You said, "I ave a lotta work and now I will have sommewhere to sleep. The Concrete Bldg was cleaned out already. you had NO CABIB. All u had was the Vardo. Now Im watching this one and you are taking tiur Vardo to AK for the first time? and the Vardo go messed up somewhat. Which is which? When did u take Vardo up for first time. When did u buidl cabin? Why does your dog have such big ears. WHy dont you have a kitty cat. Nothing makes me laugh when Im alone more than a crazy cat.  I feed a feral colony. I do it for my daughter who died in 95. I feel like she is watching. Poor kid.Straigten me out on time.
You are a very strong woman, Brooke! I'd be a bawling mess watching my son drive off like that. ❤ As a side note, was watching one of your older videos with Maisey and it was pitch black out except for the fire. Was thinking maybe a light for Moose' color, so you know its not a predator coming up on you, and just your dog. Just a thought is all. Your doing great with your dogs! ❤
I just watch the whole family on YT, I didn't realize you were all related hahahahaha.
I would tear it down …
So amazing, I love it! I live in Kodiak Alaska. The beauty is stunning this time of year. ❤ Rainiest summer I can ever remember and I have been here 50 plus years, but the lovley fall is helping me forget.
I would keep the concrete building your husband could store his bike there it's good safe storage it just needs a really heavy duty roof.
Put a roof on the concrete bunker, then use it for storage. It will be useful to you that way.
I've recently started watching your son's channel, "Betting on Alaska",  which is very interesting and well done. I've watched your channel for some time now and it took a little while to realize Mick was your son, but  I saw it in the comments. Mick is amazing and wise way beyond his years. Very articulate young man. I think he has nine videos out at this time. He's doing a great job building his cabin and clearing the land. Glad the Vardo made it to Alaska okay. It does look comfortable. You and your husband are amazing at all the building you do on your properties. I love the way you both share your faith. I also love the outdoors and fully agree to "Get outside and get happy". Take care.
I think you should put a simple roof on the bunker.   Storage is always good.
Where is the collie?
Happy Anniversary early!
I’ve just found your son’s YouTube channel and am really enjoying his content. I had no idea he was your son but it makes total sense. Love your content 👍
Your son sounds like his dad!!! You guys are awesome!!!👠🚌👠
Awesome!!! Your son looks just like you!!!👠🚌👠
delightful little dog, L'm in love
squatch out for the watches
Beautiful video.
I have no doubt that you could make the bunker a beautiful anything. It's so beautiful there in Alaska.
Taco Tuesday what a way to go 😁😁😁
I absolutely love watching these videos .    Gotta get outside.   :)
Hope Mick's land doesn't flood in the spring.... lots of melting and run-offs, I have heard. Stay warm, y'all! Best of luck with the land, Mick.
I suspect the dust came when the chimney blew over blowing wood ash out of the chimney into the room . Love your adventures .
Bunker as base for "treehouse"? 🌳🏠?
My favorite part is always your, She Gone, at the end.  Congratulations, to your son.  Love from S. California.
Make it a work shop and a Tool Shed. With a simple shed style sloping roof. And store his motorcycle in it!!
That block house would be great to turn into place to store wood with log or tin roof...
Downdraft when chimney folded over to be dusty? Try cinnamon oil around edges of cabin to keep squirrels at bay when not in use.
just a sugestion. use that cement room for food storage.
You motivated me to build in my Detroit mi backyard.
Your son will make you two proud. He's going to build up the land and there's food everywhere.  So excited for him to come into his own
Love the whole trip views. The cement structure is amazing and I see so many ideas pop up. Screen the exterior window.  Plexiglass with a layout to lock and to hold open. You can make it into something amazing.  Structure is strong too. I see you removing chimney when leaving.
Storage shed is really the best solution for the bunker . Great video!
You are an amazing craftswoman.
Maybe you could burn garbage in that concrete bunker.
Since I’ve discovered you, I’ve been watching some of your previous videos, and I have to say, I love your patchwork curtains! Did you make them yourself? Do you sew?
How in the heck did the squirrels get in the cabin?  Looks like it was totally sealed?
Maybe cover your furniture with old sheets next time?   That might help with dust and critters.  Sorry this happened to you.
What an incredibly creative and talented woman!
I watched your husband a lot also on YouTube but did not realise you were married. Great family.
I'm watching Alone with you and Dave and this vlog. I'll be watching your son as well. He's got a good head on his shoulders and I'm sure going to be a hard worker. It will be fun seeing how he developes his land.
I just finished my front window protection. It looks a bit like yours. Thanks for the inspiration!
I think my sister drove the same car he drives. She called it the “larval sack” and it kind of nauseated me
Found your website after I found your courageous sons. Enjoy all the content. Your family is an inspiration. Keep it up!
What kind of breed is your dog Moose? He's a beauty!
Beautiful! Also, your son has a very "media friendly" voice. He may have a side career doing some kind of announcing, reporting, or voice-over work! I haven't watched all your's and Dave's videos yet, but I really enjoy the laid-back, friendly, "real life" aspect, particularly when you talk about the difference between dreaming about doing what you guys do, and actually planning and preparing to do it. I realize that I will never do anything like this, but I take some pleasure in knowing that others have done it! God bless you all!
Maybe build a second story on the storage bunker.  The view would be better.  It looks like a good foundation and basement.
Squirrels through the chimney (Swiffer tails)
I was just wandering where your collie is,. So worried she wasn't with you. I'm glad she is goo😢
You could make the old building into a greenhouse
I would put a top on it cover it with the earth and have a storm shelter
What breed of dog is that?
Have u thought of making the bunker a green house some how? Just a thought after watching the video. 😊
I cant tell you how much I appreciate your knowledge, spirit, work, and content.  You are the best.
This is so funny. I found Mick's channel probably close to a month ago now. Even more recently I started binge watching homesteading videos and I came back across Bushradical, I remember watching at least one or two of his cabin videos in the past but I got hooked on him. Then I found your channel through him which I realized I had already watched and now I find out that Betting On Alaska is your son... it all comes full circle.
I was thinking how great this footage is going to be for your children and grandchildren and even the library of Congress for progeny
The ALCAN drive is beautiful!
New a little bit so I just wanted say love thisVid. I'm happy I'm back again.😊
Dave might appreciate this but I’ve been up and back to AK from Wisconsin four times on motorcycles, twice on 650 enduros…tent camping all the way. AK is so much more awesome when you “earn” the trip. I’m 62 now and think I’ve got one more trip in me.
mice...
Happy 25 years,your family is so blessed,love your channel!Once again thanks for giving me back my youth!❤
WOW, this just popped up in my feed, haven’t even watched yet; but I am in awe of the beauty, artistry and creativity of your gypsy wagon!!🤩
It is hard to watch our children grow up and go their own way. It is funny (not ha ha funny) you start off as two individuals when you meet, marry have your children. They grow up and go their own way and yes you do see them but it is different and as you get older the two of you are more alone together again and it takes awhile to adjust and know you have beautiful adult children and I know it is hard to leave them to do their own thing (as we have been through turbulent times, hardship etc etc and want to cosset them) and all they want is buzz off.  Brooke and Dave your son and daughter do you proud, what a well mannered young man he is and thanking you for the guidance to Alaska and Dave saying 'I love you son' and seeing Nick's vehicle drive off, did I feel for you both the tug of the heart strings. Nick I wish you the very best on your new adventure and future and Brooke and Dave you watching you sons progress and his adventures how proud you will be. Have a beautiful day. By the way I would keep the bunker as a storage place put a slanted tin roof on it and gauze over the window blocks and rehang the doors. A good storage space and no critters can get in through the floor or the gauze windows.
So dirty!!!
Omg!  Small world!  I saw Bushradicals channel then your camping in the cabin from that video and I’ve been watching your kids channel for a bit now…. Never knew y’all were connected!
Wow, what a beautiful and loving family. In the end that's all that matters. Your pictures of the ALCAN and Alaska brought back such emotion. I lived in Inuvik for 3 years in the early eighties and in Alaska in the late eighties. When I drove out of Alaska for the last time I remember the guy on the radio saying, "If you're not on the Russian Jack right now, you're nowhere. There are 900,000 reds in the Russian as I speak". Man, what a place!!!!! Wish I could have spent my life there. You guys are great, keep on loving each other and your son.
❤️ Love your Gypsy wagon! That bunker would make a good place to keep stuff bear proof.
Make it into a chicken coop.
How crazy, I had cam across his videos a few weeks ago! Makes me even happier to know he is your child! Praying for his success, so far I’m impressed with his hard work.
When ya'll stopped at your cabin i wanted to cry. Its when i see it that i miss what was going to be my home. I was on the same side of the road up from you. Had to leave 2 years ago to care for my aging mother. Wound up selling the property once it became obvious i would  not be coming back. Thanks, your videos keep my memories fresh.
Your gypsy vardos looks absolutely wonderful,  it could be a tiny home for one . I rather stay in a  vardos/ tiny home, than go to a hotel. wear and tear when traveling always expected. I love my little  vardos/tiny store on wheels, back in the day ,  I use it for a sewing room now , too old to travel , Now i got a two story tiny barn for a craft room / she shaid. and i live in a tiny house / old mother in law house/ I love it ,you can express yourself with tiny buildings for separate things. don't worry about the naughty critters just clean it up,  the cabin it's adorable.
Oh memories. Did that drive many times and recognized many spots we enjoyed also. Really miss living in AK.
The dirt is from your broken chimney pipe and the wind blowing in through your Woodburner.  Eddie
How much land did your son buy? How exciting!! Heck, I am jealous too! 😊
Looks sturdy, maybe a bunker if a bad storm came up .a safe place🌻
You could use the abandoned bunker for a family game of paint ball.  Throw in a couple more small structures and you could have a whole paintball course.
Not even half way yet.  YOUR SON IS SO PERFECTLY 50/50 YOU AND YOUR HUBBY.  I can see both of you so strongly.  That's a good kid.  You guys should be proud. 😊
Awe your little fur baby name is Lucy wow my little Chihuahua name is Lucy Lou  but name her after Lucy Ball  ..  she still a pup 1 /2 years old 3.6 lbs
Some type of Art Studio, for the shelter thingie...? 🤷‍♂
First time to see your channel. I know how hard it is not to give advice to your kids when they are grown. They really want and need to do things themselves, but man is it hard.
С удовольствием смотрю ваши ролики
Love the Vardo!  Don’t like the bunker-always felt not good energy  You guys are amazing
You and your husband get your gypsy dance on in the trailer
The concrete bunker will make a great storage space.  Cover and put firewood in it perhaps.
I have 2 girls and 2 boys.  The 'I love you son' at 4 mins and 45 secs hits home.  One day we'll be making these saying good bye trips with our kids.  amazing video!
The video as usual was well worth watching!
Wait... You are the mom to Betting On Alaska?? Thought I recognized the trailer from his videos 🤣
As a 35 year Alaskan I will say make sure you visit the Matanuska-Susitna Valley by far one of the most beautiful places I have ever been in my life and I have seen all 50 states.
Just subscribed to your son's channel earlier today - wasn't expecting to find a video by his mother!
That's your son?! Now this all makes sense.
You know... that block building would make a terrific root cellar if you pored a new floor and sealed up the windows and threw on a concrete roof.    Burrey it all round and on top to a depth of 3-5 feet 1 access door and a squirl/bug proof vent pipe or 2 and you've got aa place to line with shelves for food storage long term. Some hooks for hanging game and a couple 55 gal. drums w/ lids and you've got quite the larder.
Oh! Your channels are connected! I had no idea. I was just thinking wow, I just watched a kid go up there to build his cabin Betting on Alaska. I also watch your husband's channel BushRadical. I get to follow all of your journeys and that makes me so happy <3  And if for some reason I am wrong and you don't all have YouTube channels.. you guys have doppelgangers.
wow.... love the trailer....
Make the bunker into a smokehouse.
I've watched your channel for quite a few years and really enjoy.  So unbeknownst to me as to whose son he is,  I stumbled across a YouTube channel with this really awesome young man named Mickey who was moving from MI to AK right after graduation.  Thought he has a really good head on his shoulders and started watching and find myself rooting him on.  Then tonight, I saw the camper in your video caption and put two-and-two together.  Amazing!  I know he is going to do great things!
Lots of tree structure squatch activity on that land, hopefuly they dont mess with him too much
That concrete bunker could become quite good. Put steel shutters outside the windows. Put plexiglass inside and outside over the concrete grid. Some steel roof beams and a concrete roof. You could really turn that into a nuclear was survival bunker.
Nice, put a roof on it
No way! I came across your sons YouTube channel and I was like this guy has to know Dave! Low and behold! Nice work!
This might be my favorite video of yours. I have all kinds of helpful ideas I'd love to share about several of the issues, but I keep getting told that it doesn't matter how helpful, most people want to do what they want, consequences be durned. The shelter has HUGE potential... but yes, time and resources. Going to check out your son's channel.
we  got  53  years  togeather  now  lifes  good   even  after  we  both  had  heart  attc    eye s  bad  legs  bad  knees and  back  shot  lifes  still  dam  good   81  still  hunting  whittails  deer  stake  camp  fire  good  friends  coffee  great   wife  and  rottin  wenner  pup  hes  11    name  REBEL     god bless all  thanks  for the  vids  tough  camper  ya got

What is the son's vlog?
Squirrel's can be a$$holes ?
Ash in the fireplace remved ?
How about  B an B you could have two or three how fun,
I’m so happy for you.
I’m a huge fan of your son Mick!!! Not even realizing he was your son. Some time back I saw a video of yours. Then I saw this title and new who you were.
I watched a video of his yesterday. Didn't realize it was your kid
no offense but you need a carpenter to help you that trailer will not last long
Awesome video, you guys, just awesome.
😅 "Promosm"
Great video of you all travelling to Alaska with lots of adventure as a family to treasure always.  The bunker needs to come down all together, maybe one day when your into it.  When I see it in your videos it comes across as a depressing gray looking rock walls.  Picture it not being there and I am sure the land there would look more inviting.   Smash the walls in and use the rock for fill. 👍😎♥️ Sharlene from Vancouver Island, Cobble Hill BC 🌲🇨🇦👍
happy anniversary you two wife and I met as carnival workers. CARNY 28 yrs she adopted a lost puppy
Hey  Brook...loving your channel...would love to write to you with my story...66yrs and have been homesteading since 1977 in Ireland ... I'm not very tech savvy...email maybe.....loads of cool pics...cheers Catherine
Enjoyed the video, thanks for taking us along
What a wonderful inspirational video! You are a remarkable family. I for one appreciated this presentation. Above all, there is a lot of love in your family. You know there are many people that would love to have the choices that you people have made. Perhaps that itself would be a video to present. How to have choises in homesteading, camping,  and being a great parent. Thank you again, y'all are awesome!~
How funny!!  Compare a highway rest stop in Manitoba or Alaska  with a rest stop in TX!!  If you've been there, you know!
I subscribed to Nicks channel and watched his videos!!   I had no idea he was y’all’s son.
👍👍👍,MA|aysia
Truly a great video
Liked and subbed!! ❤❤❤ them Alaskan mountains are so beautiful ❤❤ this is my favorite mobile home I’ve ever seen. Great job
Can’t you make a bear,,any animals that may want your a new home to destroy the goods inside you may want to have later
Hi Reed City, MI from the mtns of NE WA State. Cadillac, MI Native here.
Make the new space a tool storage!
I stumbled upon this cute, innocent looking young man's YouTube Channel and his well spoken wprds made me smile.  Something seemed familiar about him and then amazing!  He is the son of 2 of my fave YT channels!  What a neat surprise!  I just wanna hug him like a nephew and I can only imagine how hard ot must have been to let go the parent strings.  Cheers to you two and to Mick!  Subscribed!
I’ve watched a lot of your videos and also a lot of Dave’s videos. I’m seriously thinking of getting some off grid property and see if I can ease into it to see if I’ll like it. However, there are a couple of everyday issues that I’ve never seen you or Dave tackle. The issues are for off grid or semi off grid or even camping or maybe you you go stay in the UP. Issue 1: How do you tackle washing dishes. And 2: How do you do laundry?
I wonder if the bunker might not make a nice enclosed garden, with easy ways to keep the wildlife from disturbing the growing things,.
It is nice to see the both of you together as a team again
Lovely
One thing you can consider for the survival bunker would be to turn it into a solar powered shop, where you could come and work on projects, depending depending on how far away your son is, could also use it for projects as well
The dust, cracks, and "dulling out"... just character and charm from the Alaska Highway leaving it's mark. Been down that road twice- once in and once out... will do it again in a heartbeat... and NOTHING comes off that road without more "character" for it.
Glad to see you guys are still together!!!!!!!  ❤
Snicker that little pup trying to chase squirrels... his transmission is about 2 inches off the ground! Lol
Years ago my husband rebuilt an old 1965 caravan, which had been used at car shows as a spares container.  The interior was full of delaminated ply, dexion shelving and spiders.  My husband was a joiner, so he was able to rebuild it.  Travellers told us that it had been manufactured by a firm who hoped it would replace the bowtops, but this did not happen and only six were made.  We took it to country shows and rallied with it.  It attracted a lot of attention.  Sadly owing to my husband being terminally ill we had to sell it.  Friends bought it and rally with it.  Best wishes from Susan in UK.  I found your sons videos today, and will be following his journey.
So fascinating a life you have, I love seeing your episodes. Thank you for sharing your most authentic and creative energy. ☺️🌻🙏
I would turn that building into a spa a sauna and maybe a hot tub heated by wood
With both of your experiences with nature and outdoors, I can't believe that you left the cabin with clothes out, linens on beds, shoes out, food in cupboards.  Easy to use totes with clothes and linens stored, covered, and to take out all foods.
glad the trip was uneventful. i subscribed to your sons channel. he has his work cut out for him but i'm sure he'll get it done.  looking forward to watching the family videos.
Wow!  Mickey's face is identical to Brooke's! 😳  I've never seen anyone that resembled a parent more.  Good work Brooke, obviously you have powerful DNA!  💪🧬😉 Blessings to Mickey taking his plunge into adulthood, he has had the best teachers for it all.   Thanks and blessings to you all for sharing!  🙏👏❤❤❤
I'm heading over to subscribe "Betting on Alaska" looking forward to seeing what your son will do with that land and what kind of structure he will put on it!
i have a Question for you Brook. what part of Alaska would you suggest to someone wanting to move there and find land?
Is this all in delta
You Sure did a very Good job, This one is so cute.. the way you decorted it..Glad your Son an Husband is with you..Alk. is tough...Becareful.. Lucy is cute.. Love n Hugs..Barbie..
Hey Brook. I was at the American Legion in the Soo last night and I met your cousin, Barb. We had some laughs. Anyway, I thought I'd come on here and give a shout out
Hey Brooke you could turn the cell block bunker into a massive firewood storage shed. Depends how accessible it is to your other cabins.  It’s a pretty gloomy structure (but clearly solid!) for much else otherwise, though I’m sure with some juiced up creative inspo and a gallon or two of sweat it could reap potential for something useful 😁 Would make a great chicken condo if you were living on that parcel!
Why don’t you stay in the cabin?
I think the concrete "building" could get a roof and a couple of doors, and used just like a big shed/storage area. I think it would be nice to have a place to store things, maybe even food if you close it good enough, that way when mr squirrel comes back again, your main resources and tools/machines will all be safe and secure in the bunker. Doesn't have to be a pretty makeover, just good enough so it works as safe storage, same way people do with containers up there, using them as sheds.
Widen one doorway a few feet enough to squeeze in a quad or riding mower. One pitch roof with a lean too to store some firewood.  And a nice Camo paint job on the outside like it never even happened.
I'm not sure why you are so surprised with dirt and squirrels!!!
When my wife and I left the military in 1978, we drove down from Anchorage. It took 5 days to reach Seattle, with 1200 miles of gravel road along the way. That was an experience I will never forget.
That must of been some major road construction
Use those peanuts to trap the squirrels and transport them far, far, away.
Nice place to store can goods an canning goods, secure
The snow probably slid off the roof and took the pipe with it.
What do ya do for water ? Such a Blessing for a nice place.
What a beautiful piece of land Micky has.
This is an exceptionally gorgeous build! ❤
I can relate with sympathy to releasing your sons into their adult lives!   Why do you need so many vehicles???  Knock a wall down, roof it and use the bunker as a garage?
Maybe a work shed?
My husband and I just found your channel today, and we are enjoying your adventures. We found your husband's and son's channel yesterday and are enjoying those as well. Does your daughter also have a YouTube channel? Looking forward to future videos from all of you. 🙂
You could use gas struts to keep the window cover open 😊
Beautiful
Too many projects 🤔
I wish Micky would have given college a try. It’s so hard to make it these days without a degree. He’s a smart kid.
❤ loved this episode.  Wish your son all good things.  Vardo is so cool.  The bunker I think it's a ton of work too.  It might be best just to make it for storage or like a garage in the future.  Be waiting to see your next video until next time take care.❤
If only someone would invent something to cover the backside of your tires with to keep all the dirt to a minimum. Oh wait, isn't that what mud flaps do? I follow Red Poppy Ranch and I just SMDH when I see Cedar's new jeep covered in mud.  We old WV stump jumping boys dont tolerate it, we spend a few mins putting them on and they are a lot easier to clean off than the entire car.
Where is your Collie?
Happened by your sons property Saturday when I was down there, recognized it from his channel, good luck to him and welcome back to the great state!
Ain’t no party like a squirrel party!
I'm thinking that dust all over the inside of your cabin might be from your wood stove due to the wind blowing through the broken chimney pipe.
I just found your sons channel last night.
As a mom, I cried when he drove off. Your baby has flown the nest.
THAT’S your son? I just started watching his YT channel 😃
"Acer Acerpori"  As the maple , so the sapling.
Ok for the bomb shelter 😅,  How about a paintball hide out ? It'd be fun ...
If I had known you were headed through Manitoba ...
My fear, with the survival bunker, is that you can still smell gas.  As you said it might be good for storing things but to sit inside sounds scary
Regilated up the wazoo! Such bs. Im in tje USA. Who the  F@*! is the government to tell  private citizens what we can live in on our own property?! The forefathers of the USA are rolling over in their graves!!
OMG how beautiful! Someday I want to go to Alaska and photography all there is to see. I need a camper something like yours to really do it right.
It would be a great storage space .
Not me crying watching your son driving off. The moment you cut the last string holding them back but make sure the heart strings never are is.
Love the vardo, traveling story. Very creative..
Cool, just found your son’s blog Betting on Alaska this morn in my algorithm. Then, yours popped up. Well done
Don’t leave your batteries in your vehicles over winter. Pack them up and take them with you.
Brooke I absolutely love your videos, always look forward to them! I can't wait to see what adventures we have this summer!! Thank you for sharing your beautiful family with us! Ps: My daisy will run around for the both of them😂💕
I’m happy for your son and I know your love will see him through this new chapter of his life ,moose is a goof,glad maysie is still here and HAPPY ANNIVERSARY to you and Dave🎉I love you both and your humor 😂please keep making videos for all of us who admire you so 😊❤
Nice maybe see you up here in Alaska! If you make it to the Girdwood area south of Anchorage hit me up!
hi brooke and dave awesome scenary you got a busy time ahead clraning up that mess i remember you finding all those trash bags lol that squrrils havin a game with moose
Squirrel Party !! 🎉
Build a cottage on top of the bunker, you never would get snowed in and maybe less bugs if you are up. People here have build a house on a WW2 German bunker and use the bunker as a wine cellar because of the constant temperature. Germans know how to build thick walled wine cellars .... They are all over the place.
Oh man! What an amazing gypsy wagon. Tearing up at the idea of my son leaving the nest, I can’t imagine how you guys are feeling. ❤ Sending love!  Signed, a fan from Alaska! :)
Dang, another great adventure. What a long crappy drive. The scenery was great, when you could see it.  Glad the cabin was in pretty good shape.  Your son is a chip off two blocks!  Can't wait to follow him on his Alaska Adventure.  Of course, Moose the squirrel hunter, is happy anytime he can run free and do his thang. You are such a great videographer. I feel I am there.  It's a big change from our palm trees and year round heat here in Costa Rica.  I just so enjoy seeing our 49th state through your appreciative eyes. Thanks again and love to all.
Use it as a storage. Im with you, i would not want to live in that thing. Its also a lot of work. Thanks for sharing.
Hi Brooke. I just subscribed to a channel,  Betting on Alaska!  I couldn't be more proud if he were my own! ❤
I really enjoyed following you guys in this episode because everything at anniversary 25 comes about full circle as to what your next generation will do... exciting, and always a pleasure to follow. 😀
a rolled up plastic bag in between the split doors might be a good temp fix
Hi Brooke.  Just wondering. How did the squirrels get into your cabin.? We don't like the squirrels either. I want to go open season on these critters. They're pests for sure. Thanks for sharing.
I miss Maysie😥😥
The bunker could be a storage space down the road.
I love the idea to put curved solar panel on rooftop!
If do a piece of rubber around door for where raining was coming in.
I didnt know he is your son. just come across his video, 'Betting on Alaska' his channel name btw and I liked his mind set and all, start following. I am so surprised. good luck with his journey. I am sure he learned so much from his parents.
Gorgeous , ginormous snow topped rocky mountains along  Hgwy 1 up British Columbia on into Alaska. That beautiful mountain range backdrop beyond that Alaskan bison farm ; along with all that far out natural scenery in BC; altogether shows how beautiful the whole of the Northwest really is. Hehe, I'm glad Ms. Gypsy Vargo made that tremendous trek from mama Michigan to mama Alaska. (God bless mama America!)   P.s. Good luck to Nicky in all he puts his hand to .
I just got whiplash.   Bug time.  Uve watched your channel off and on.  I found you after alone.  Anyhow i watched your just yesterday had no clue he was yours.  So funny how the internet works.
Forget it follow your gut. Run!! Don’t waste your time and energy
Why do you have so many vehicles sitting around?
Your Gypsy Wagon is absolutely adorable! It gives me a lot of ideas. What proud parents that your son is going in the right direction. I am torn between purchasing a small lot in a lake rv community and raw land. I look forward to more videos.
When dave is talking about your son breaking down  in foreign country with a Canadian flag on his baseball hat drinking his coffee from a Tim's cup, maybe it's just me as a canadian when I travel in the states and I break down  I get the same service as I do in Canada  so basically u are but  I don't consider the states  a foreign country. Stay safe and enjoy your travel what ever country you are in.
Care-A-Beaners!  HA, always liked that word!
For the concrete building, stick a roof on it and use it for storage.
Such beautiful scenery! You guys build such nice places I don’t think I’d do anything with the cinder block place for now. Your son seems so excited. That is so great! I wish him all the best 😊
Congratulations on 25 years, my wife & I have been married 23 years.
Your camper trailer has inspired me to make some upgrades to a utility trailer that my dad built when I was a kid and then gave to me a few years ago. I’m looking forward to watching your son’s journey on his new property. What an inspiring family you are! Also, I think you should turn the survival bunker into a barn/shed for storage. You could put Dave’s bike in it when you leave for the winter! Don’t invest too much time if you’re just not feeling it. Thanks for another great video!
Cutting that umbilical cord is the best way to send them on their owned future.  Makes them self sufficient and appreciative of the hard work you guys put onto him. Great parenting.  He is a great kid. All worth it! God bless him on his journey.
❤ from Alaska
Every time I drive up I stop at the car wash in Tok and wash my truck to make sure that I'm still driving mine. Lol
Love the vardo 😊.
:)
🙋‍♀️❤
As for the old concrete out building.  What about making it a Bear Proof cellar?  Closing it in would allow it to keep cool from the concrete even in the summer.  I'm also going to sub to the son's tube to see how well he does.  The early starts are the hardest part.
Gotta love this state. The great open wilderness. How do you guys know where to pull off with a trailer to find a spot in this state. Last thing want to do is get stuck and not be able to turn around.
shed is what I was thinking.
I'd put a metal roof on it used as a barn or shed somewhere to keep stuff in the winter time that you're not going to use
Oh, my gosh! I remember when you dicovered that "shelter" and all the STUFF you found in there (and had to clean out! ) Use it for tool storage! Cant wait to see your son's progress on his beautiful property!
Hardest part of being a parent is not saying a word
Dirt is good  Fussy Dusty  Lol
So glad your barn didn't fall in   NICE 👍 loft is it a hay bed ?
Another day somebody was trying to tell me I can't have a service dog and a therapy Together I read the laws and standard English and ever totally different than what they were stated over the phone in Wisconsin and upper Michigan  Standard English said I can have both dogs and they got to actually pay for and provide their certification  Both of my dogs were certified before I even was given them by the government program...  I don't have to show of any certification I don't take them to the store..   SO EXCUSE ME WHEN THERE'S NOT ENOUGH HOUSING FOR PEOPLE  IT'S NOT MY FAULT  THAT THE COUNTRY'S FALLING APART  JUST LIKE BEFORE THE GREAT DEPRESSION AMERICA SUFFERED SO MUCH FOR YEARS  WHILE PARTS OF EUROPE ABSOLUTELY FLOURISHED A LOT OF THE COUNTRIES THAT BECAME OUR ENEMIES WERE FLOURISHING  SHOW DON'T FORGET WHO THE NOME IS...  🌠😇🗝️⚡ APOLLO HIMSELF OLD

Moose keeping mama safe from all the rabid covid zombie squirrels.  Just like we do for mama and daddy. Love Chewbacca and Phoenix in Kentucky
Don't forget the moose. He's taken up da woofs  cause. You're in safe paws with the moose.  Love Chewbacca and Phoenix keeping mama and daddy safe in Kentucky
How about a safety shelter of some sort for the building.
Not too many words to say except a great job of preparing your kids for life. And enjoying the same outdoor life together. In a word…wonderful! Maybe one more thought. You two take everything in stride and forge ahead. So…another word, inspiration!
Could you put sometime of roof on it and use it for some type of storage
The bunker has a bad vibe. There is something very odd about it.
Good show title, but you all very good at a lot.  The other day I sent you guys some Lodge skillets and a tiny Buck pocket knife.  When I did that, it was wishing your kids a great future.  I have never been a Godfather or Godmother.  I will always have your kids back. You grown ups are on your own.  I love you all.
Storage shed seems appropriate indeed....move on from it and live in a cozy, finished place!
Just such an incredibly beautiful/stunning/creative caravan!  Love it; love the artistic flare!🙌😊🔥🙏
What a beautiful video!  The vardo is a real masterpiece, you are amazing ❤
Alaska is so pretty! That concrete building would be great for storage. Just need doors and a roof 😊
I love the bunker, but I wouldn’t put too much hard work into it.  I’d put a roof on it made of that clear plastic roofing then decide on what next.  I’d probably leave the doors off and plant some vines and perennials, put a bistro table and chairs in it and make a folly out of it.
Mick's channel is really, really good. You must be so proud!
make it a storage shed?
Turn the concrete box into a shop or shed; that would be a good idea for it.😊
Excellent!👏🇬🇧
Have you thought about maybe turning the bunker into a secure storage for the bike and maybe some solar powered battery tenders/tools/etc...
Squirrel party!
Just a wonderful video all around: loved the update, the views of the ride up, and seeing the vardo! Just my opinion, but that building is always going to feel like a "bunker". Leave it alone for now and build what you really want, where you want it. I can tell you have a gut instinct to do that! Blessings to you!
Nothing about that cabin for being away is dirty compared to what we see here in Utah from mice and packrats that want to come in an eat everything. The dust youre seeing I bet is rodents chewing on that wood to get in. With how little poop there was they havent been in long likely form the time snow melted.
'Nother great video, was wondering what your kids were up to these days as I have seen very little about them.  We have avoided the Alcan Highway due to hearing other's horror stories about it.  We take the scenic Alaska Marine Highway from Bellingham, WA as we enjoy sleeping in or near the atrium on the back of the boats.
This made me tear up... EMPTY NESTERS... 😢☺😘 HAPPY to see u guy's having so much enjoyment with I know, must be a little bit of heavy hearts... ❤
Maybe , with some de blocking and a roof, a carport?
Dust and dirt is probably from soot blown from air coming in through the broken chimney?
long journey to Alaska from MI.....no mechanical problems is a ++.  beautiful camping and your land holdings are a treasure.  cement 'suvival' bunker - remember when you cleaned in out last year.....yikes!  I would relax and enjoy your precious time in Alaska and not give a thought to the bunker!  You have a beautiful cabin, I guess on another parcel!  Love your son's adventuresome spirit.  I just subscribed to his channel💛💚
Thanks for your video.  I shared💖
Your so Creative and Inspirational!  Greeting from Tok, Alaska.   Getting ready to go to Fast Eddie’s  to eat those famous Mushrooms!
Maybe that survival shelter is pleading to be made for into a two story summer cabin! The bottom is a great place to store stuff, but if you can use those walls as the foundation you could make an amazing open air/screened-in room above, catch the breeze and hot summer days and enjoy a bit of a view from a higher vantage point? Either way, it’s impressive how cleared out you got it at your last visit!
If Any if you should ever end up at Alaska Regional hospital for any reason ask for Sean Murphy. He is my cousin. He will make sure they take good care of you!
Glad to see your art work made it there and nothing damaged ❤ Mickey has a nice place and looking forward to see what he does there.
7:19 it’s a real Gypsy Wagon now
I’d 100% out a clear roof and screens in the windows on that block building. Instant greenhouse! 🌱
so awesome , im going over to your sons channel also , be safe friends , see you on the next one
I’m not through watching this vid so idk if you’re still in AK but if you can you should come to Girdwood! It’s a ski town and your cool tow behind would fit right in !
I have been watching your son's videos. I think he learned a lot from you! I think some kids do absorb good parenting. I can tell.
Take out the end wall of the "bunker" and make it into an equipment shed.
i was thinking storage space as well. could be made pretty secure with not too to much work. love the little gypsy cabin made that long haul. So happy for your son. How exciting for him! Loved this. hugs
Isn't it awesome when you can hand down your knowledge and likes to your kids? He'll be a steward to his land as you both are, and as am I. Awesomeness.
It was so unpleasant watching your son asking for donations on you tube, selling himself like mamma does. This is not how you raise children. Following in his parents footsteps getting rich off the public. Get  honest .
Brooke, considering over 4,000 rough miles through nasty weather and NO structural damage....TOTAL WIN!  it looks so cool, how could you NOT have a totally cool camp out in it.  What a nice thing to have to stop over for the night for a restorative  nap every night.   You really did a remarkable job building the vardo.  What a cool first  date- AK in AK wagon.  (After Kids in Alaska!)  Keep on truckin' baby!   Loved this video, you and all you guys do!   PS- I'd Def just put that polycarbonate clear corrugated roof on the shelter, use it for storage and a shed for Dave to work in bad weather..maybe a shower area in the corner.....  an all purpose out building.  I'm sure just storage would fill it...the bike and stuff you winterize.   Much love from FL! Cheryl🥰❤️🌅🛶
I have a friend that lives in Alaska.  They hunt for meat and fish even in the winter. Food is so expensive there. Everything is expensive there. I would worry about the grisly bears.
I think you should let Mama Nature take the bunker back.
I was telling Dave about the show alone last Saturday middle episode when u guys left ..I’m in Connecticut and the show is still airing here and it’s cool 😎
Just gotta say there's no way I could use that burner setup you have for coffee. Guarantee I'd knock the dam* thing over and burn my trailer down. Your son sounds very grounded - I wish him and you all the best.
It would be a great garage.
So cool, that you get to see what your son will do with that land. Glad you guys made it safe, look good. I would turn the bunker into storage.
It's been a long time since I saw that, whatever that is building, I guess if it has enough structural integrity it has some storage value, if that top plate isn't on there soon I would imagine the water will just cause icy blowouts in the Blockwork. I wouldn't actually know what to do with it either. Going to be bear proof? you mentioned it didn't feel good, and it doesn't feel good to me  either, it actually is kind of creepy in a way. Perhaps its purpose could be a Plan B, perhaps the roof and the doors can be fixed? Perhaps you can drill a well in the middle of it, I put in a secure diesel generator with a proper fuel tank , and lay up some dehydrated stores. Some vehicle necessities... but it looks difficult.   Perhaps putting up a basement water barrier and pushing dirt up all around it would add to a security and survivability, the roof ideally would support a layer of earth over the top, a true surface bunker .... who knows
I would put a clear plastic roof on that ‘bunker’. Sunroom. Paint it bright white. It’d be a great greenhouse too.
Watching you sons channel as well. What’s mess to clean up.
You put it together with picky dust, what do you expect
Awesome!!!
I am wondering what it's gonna take to get some of that cleared up on the base, what kind of equipment one would use. I guess if one just gets started , one is taught pretty fast
Swear I saw that little travel trailer go past Manerds when I was standing in the parking lot noting its art work....
Just pop a roof on the bunker! The windows are great for storms. The guiding! Makes this Grandma tremble
I absolutely love being out in the great outdoors with you! You and Dave are the best.  Storage shed or work shop?
i have subscribed to him an have enjoy what i have seen!
Hello Mickey❤
On the survival bunker, why don’t you build up from the top of it. It looks like it would easily support anything you wanted to build above that. The bottom could be storage and a motorcycle garage. Then you could build anything you want above. It would keep you high and dry. It would be a nice place for guests as well.
But I saw what the squirrels did you you know your two things you got to do when you build a place where there's squirrels squirrel frustrators in the gaps in the walls so they can't get in they're like fire breaks but for squirrels cuz if you leave any little opening damn squirrels will get in and just tear a place apart they're almost as bad as bears. I like your home on wheels but I've had the same problem in my camper I had a camper shell on my truck and it's a seals the back seals usually when you get on red Dusty roads oh my God the crap that comes in your into your place
Thanks for the videos. You guys Surviving Ringworm, Shawn James, Canadian castaway and 9-5 life off grid have been a real inspiration. My youngest of the 4 girls loves corgis. Put a timber frame in the bunker. Use it as storage.
Outdoor plastic furniture spray works good on my jeep rims. Its got a flex agent in it. I got 7 years before kids out of house. Hopefully will have cottage done and working on boat build. So I can go do some sailing. I will record myself Building block piers. Decided on a post and beam with square notches. I cant wait to go home to the U.P. this week.
Use those peanuts to catch them squirrels ; )
Maybe throw a roof on the bunker and that’s a more secure storage space?
Squirrels are rats. They are just as filthy and slobs at housekeeping.. lol
Is he gonna start a channel? We’d love to see how he does!
Maybe when the chimney collapsed - soot blew in?  Just a thought.
The concrete building Might make a bear safe smokehouse!
Well, you could turn that bunker into a walkin basement and put a whole cabin on top of it. It would give you a nice workshop for sure and storage too. Just saying.
Great piece of property your son has first thing I would do is get a goat
I used to live in Fairbanks and the roads were awful. 30 mph was fast.
So happy to see everyone (including the Vardo) made it to AK in one piece. My hubby and I are celebrating 25 years this year as well, it's not often you hear of marriages lasting that long anymore, I feel like an anomaly, and I am glad we aren't the only ones! Mick will be just fine, he had fantastic role models - and he's following in those footsteps.
I am in tears right now.  I miss Alaska so much.  I want to go home.  I refuse to take that death in a needle so I can't travel through Canada.  If I can figure out how to move my household back there, I will go.  It will take a lot of money and a person needs to have a place to "go" to when you get to Alaska.   My children weren't born in Alaska but they were raised there.  And yes we miss Alaska a lot.
Yes Brooke but a slant roof and use as a storage shed!
Alaska ....the land of plaid 🎉🎉🎉
Iam so happy that the whoof is doing good.
The lil survival bunker would make such a fun fort/hideout for any grandkids that may come in the future! Back when i was a kid stuff like that kind of stuff was great to play pretend lol
I think your cabin was invaded by mice during the winter - not likely squirrels - mice can make a heck of a mess in a hurry.
Your son has really nice voice. 🙂
I so enjoy your son's channel. Fun to see both mom and dad in him. It is going to be wonderful watching him make his own way. I loved the part of mom and dad in the truck expressing how hard it is to "back away and take your advise with you".  🙂
Brooke,  I don’t mean to put you on the spot, but I have a burning question for you and Dave. In all the adventures have either of you two experienced the large hairy forest beings?
That ol' roofless building: Storage. Along the walls, deep shelves with a crib down the middle for ply and long stock. In my world, that's a VALUABLE space!!!
Put a slanted roof on the bunker and just use it for a storage shed. Like for garden tools and stuff.....
Hey Brooke! I recognize that forest at 2:41 from around the Sandilands area in Manitoba! My province. So cool. Mickey was a little bit tired of Manitoba and Saskatchewan lol (understandable). How cool is it that your son has his first property at his age! Wow. Well done.
How Long you left this place ?
make block building animal abattoir
Both of you did a wonderful job raising your kids in such a proper manner! You guys rock!  My own son is striking out on his own after escaping from Los Angeles this year to our mountain cabin in the AZ White Mtns., and we hope the best for him as it's his world to go conquer.  Thanks for a great video!
WOW I want to go there.
Do it for storage. Cement seems out of place for views or even peace
🌻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️
Coming back to a living area after some time  will always have a few problems to deal with  which was on the video , maybe looking back things could have been done better to seal the place up , the concrete shelter maybe turn it into a work shop or like what you said on the video a storage area or it could be the fact its time to knock it down..  Girl in the woods.
I’m so glad you’re showing the world how beautiful my home, British Columbia, is. Now to follow Mickey to watch how his adventures unfold
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
The bunker could be a nice storage for stuff you don't want to look at but will be better protected. It does look a bit uninspiring but if someone can do something about it,  it you. Have a wonderful anniversary. In Denmark we call it silver wedding. Its a big deal here that is celebrated just as much as the wedding day itself.
No better people to learn from than you and your husband. You both seem very kind, smart, loving, and hard working. I hope everything goes well for your son. It was a dream of mine to build my own home but life sometimes has different plans. My wife was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, which has also spread throughout her body. Her doctors will not do surgery until they’re able to get the spreading to stop. Unfortunately, they don’t see that happening any time soon. So we are kinda stuck where we live because of the top rated cancer center near us. At this point I’d be happy with just spending a week in a location like this. Much love from Texas 🤙
Where's the wolf? Beautiful places that you're all traveling thru god bless America. They grow up so fast awesome times. Love the tiny house on wheels. 🙏🦾🍻🎣📸
Congrats on 25 years!
What about a root cellar? You might want to get those tanks inspected, if they are old and rusty. You might want to keep those for you to use.
This was really 😊😊fun!
The wind blowingin the chimney, probably how squirrely got in.
How do y’all determine your property boundaries, do you get surveys, mark them yourselves, or?
they got in, inside stove pipe  that's why it's so dusty..
It must be nice to like your partner. Great life
Where is the Wolff ?
I think you and Dave should make a Hansel and Grettle cottage out of it put on a three foot knee wall with a 12 12 pitch roof. Put a call out to the viewers lets say get everyone to put up a hundred dollars towards the building of it and then let them stay in it for a week while you are up their on your property. Give people who were never in alaska to experiance it and at a fair price. and then you could have make shift projects for them to do while up visiting. Have everyone put a little something into the project to add a accent to it! Make  the ugly duckling turn into the Swan. Then later on it could be a guest house for friends and family!
I enjoyed this vlog from so many perspectives! First, from yours, as parents driving a son so far for H{S new Alaskan experience/adventure. Beautiful vistas and nature come next. Most of all though, were, for me, the first-time perspectives you gave us of what that trip trip across the Plains must have been like for our foremothers and - fathers. Imagine all the dust and wet at the end of the day around the the campfire! There surely would be "no rest for the weary" cleaning out and dusting before bedtime. The bedrolls might have been the only useable objects. I imagine eating and cooking utensils were carefully protected from the elements. However,  imagine changing a baby and washing off the the children, let alone the adults. Thanks so much for this possibly very real picture of those times. God bless you! Patricia
That structure reminds me of a kitchen. If you had foot traffic it could be a seasonal kitchen. Add a pizza oven. You got Alaskas next Pizza place. Your son may have a winter time income with a place to snowmobile or cross country ski to that has food! Be a destinstion.
The epoxy would have sealed up everything so no need for caulking, and make that concrete bunker into a storage shed, simple way.. buy roof trusses with a 45deg angle and tin roof... 1 or 2 days work and make it rodent proof with steal mesh all around. How did the squirrels get into ya cabin??
I'd be happy to meet a woman like you but the farm won't let me do what you do
Love Da Woof!
Shudda painted the exterior with an Epoxy resin so no dirt would penetrate the wood and make it waterproof, then all ya have to do is hose it down to clean it.... Epoxy is bulletproof compared to lacquer.
What a beautiful adventure, thank you so much for sharing it. XxX
Must be so strange to have it be just you and Dave now. My son is in the Marines and my daughter is doing her think. Life is so strange. Thank God I have my wife Kelly. Love the videos
Put a roof on the bunker and use it for a shed.
For now, put a crude roof on the bunker to shelter benches, firewood, fuel, and Dave's bike. The real vision will come with the need. My biggest concern (and Moose's) is how the squirrels entered the cabin. Keep the squirrels outside, and you'll be happy!
I was wondering why I haven't seen a video of your kids camping with you!
I love your gypsy wagon! And your cowboy corgi is so cute! But do you have new respect for trailor design? I do!😯💞💞💞
So cool! Best of luck to him. Y'all have taught your kids well. I know you are so proud. ❤ Love your channels!❤🙏Jane in SC
Great video. I'm glad you posted keep them coming thanks
Love the views beautiful
Storage shed definitely
How about using the survival bunker as a base of a tree house?
Turn the Alaska bunker into a green house. How about tat?
I’ve been following your son’s channel without realizing who he was. I don’t know what I was thinking (or not thinking) of course that’s YOUR kid!
Where is Maisy?
Another fantastic, amazing video. And exceptionally special and goods because the three of you were together as a family. Your youngest boy there is a very lucky guy has two awesome parents. I think my thoughts on the survival bunker is to roof it with aluminum or whatever and put the doors on it of some sort and perhaps use it for your meat hanging area if you guys hunt
is it so dusty from when the chimbly went over , the wind pushed in down the through the stove ?
So nice to see your son following in your footsteps.  Often wondered if your kids embraced your lifestyle or not. Thanks for sharing
Love the vids from both you guys, looking to following your son on his you tube adventure also. A tip from a lifelong construction guy....When sealing seams of any material outside or inside, ditch the silicone. The stuff just doesn't perform well compared to a polyurethane caulking like "Big Stretch" brands and others. Silicone just doesn't bond/stretch well over time with material temperature changes, especially when it's 2 different materials like metal to wood, or glass to wood. Every 3 years guaranteed you will be cutting silicone out and redoing it. Not so with polyurethane products. BTW, I built campground outhouses over 20 years ago in Idaho that you can still go to and that original poly caulking is still stable.....sealing glass board edges to cedar trim. That is impressive.
What an awesome job raising your children! What you have instilled in them can never be taught in school. Brooke & Dave, well done!👍💖
Great video!!!!👍🏻
If the bunker sits nice and level you might use it as a foundation to build a cabin on top of it. Like a Coastal house up out of the flood zone. Just a thought. Looks like you all have plenty of projects to keep busy on.
I would take that bunker and cement those windows up put a solid roof on it and close it up for an equipment storage shed. It’s solid and would keep things out of the elements
Our Air Force son stationed in Alaska also fell in love with it. Bought a house in Wasilla, and does all the great things Alaska has to offer: hiking, fishing, photography, hunting, snow sports, AND found a serious girlfriend that shares his passions! We live in Florida. sigh. I've watched you for years Brooke and this video drew tears cause I can relate!!
... You have a son? First in over a year finding that out. That , is disturbing.
Maybe the bunker can just be storage
I don't know why, but that bunker creeps me out!
Storage would be perfect ❤😊
Bunker house =storage. I love the vardo!
I thought dad was going to cry. 😢The empty nest time is truly painful. You guys did a great job raising him. Enjoyed the update.
I love when both of you are on videos together!
I've never been to Alaska,  it's beautiful but what do u do there.  Nothings around.  Think I'd go crazy with nothing there..... Surprised you don't get squatters when your gone.
Storage Unit sounds smart. Place to put the motorcycle, dry storage, etc.
Your very lucky you have eachother n love eachother.  I was divorced at 24 yrs married.  HE chested.   My children all left me years ago n my ex ruined my relationship with them.  He ruined many things.   So I'm alone .  I have someone but I'm mostly alone.
Brooke. Could you use the survival building for storing wood if you insulated it somehow ? 🍀🍀😺😺💚💚🍀🍀
Children leaving home really feels bittersweet. I had two sons, empty nest is an understatement. But we ourselves left home too. Children are the arrows that we shoot into the future. Good speed young ones, and parents you will figure it out one day at a time. Time to let the parents rest.
First time here!  Love the Gypsy Vardo!   Your cabin is awesome.  The open 14 x 14 hut maybe for food storage?  or play house for grandkids?  yes, hard to decide .
What a beautiful world God made for us
You and Dave did good

It will be exciting to see what your son builds!!! You'll be surprised, and remember, it'll be EVERYTHING HE LEARNED FROM MOM AND DAD!!!! 💛🌲
Bunker. Add a clear roof or hoop and use as a greenhouse…?
How early in the year were you traveling on the highway to Alaska?
Maybe leave the bunker for a foot for the grandkids someday?
Maybe you could just paint the inside of the bunker like a magical little woods. Just murals. Something pretty to look at
Firewood storage
I bet that was a hard trip letting him go even though I know you are proud of him, he still your baby….yeah that’s a hard decision on the old concrete block…
It's so tranquil scenery so fantastic
was very nice watching all the video GOD bless you and family 👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏
I'm so happy to see y'all very happy,  it really touched my heart!!❤
Hello May 🤠 thanks for the beatiful video👍👏 Friendship from Belgium Europe 😉🇧🇪👋🇺🇸🐕🐾❤️
Do the two of you have protection against big wildlife?
It is so awesome that your son is going to enjoy his piece of heaven and experience the beauty of off grid life. best wishes for Mickey!! Thanks Brooke, I do miss your girl Da Woof so much and Moose is such a great dog, love him!! Windsor, Ontario Canada.
Oh girl, when y’all parted after the road trip together, misty eyed was an understatement. I’ve got twin boys about the same age and wow, those are the moments that warm your heart when they say thank you💙  y’all did good, Mom & Dad and thank you for bringing us along.💙
I am Canadian! Hearing you took about travelling through a foreign country made go “What!” It’s strange to hear someone call Canada a foreign country.    Maybe it’s because I don’t think our neighbours as foreign.
I'm a guitar player. Was that guitar on that bed all this time? Ha!
To bad the neighbors are not very nice.
Hi again BROOKE  Yes always enjoy your updates.  A long trip but soo worth it to see your son's new site and getting to revisit your place too.  Those darn squirrels seem to be able to get in anywhere and can do nasty mess and damage.  All in all the cabin did good considering a hard Alaska winter.  For that lovely lol cement structure i was thinking a good storage bldg after enclosing.  Thinking it's alot of work on something you don't   like!! Thx as always for sharing.  Also plz know you and Dave have been and are wonderful parents which is the best job you've ever done!  Catcha next time.
Wow...the views are amazing! Many blessings and good luck to your son, he has you heart!
Yeah this was great. It gave me insight about what to look for when it’s time to check on my land.
I can’t imagine that day!!! It can’t be helped, we parents just don’t want the kids to have any disadvantage but the kids want to learn even if it’s the hard way. They will ask questions in their 30s after they have made a few dumb but expensive mistakes. You’ll be there to offer them your insights.
glad yall had a safe trip
Hey Brooke thank you for the video I enjoyed it and I'm thinking the same thing as you maybe use that place as a storage shed just put a little effort in it to get a top on it that's it
Long but beautiful drive!  Oh my - the views!  And really, I thought your cabin made it through the winter pretty well! Must feel good to be there.  Enjoy!
Just watch your son on his YouTube channel I’ve been watching since he started it. He’s an amazing young man raised by amazing parents. You may have never said to him learn to toil for your own food but Watching mom and dad and action has told him that. Thank you for sharing your lives with us😊😊
Love this! Good job Mom and Dad!❤ He will do great!
Nice land for your son, does he have a you tube channel to watch his progress , a celler/storm shelter maybe for the cinder block house
Yay, Alaska.  I've been following you and Dave since the first time you were on Alone.  I love to see your properties and what you do to them.  Too cool that your son bought land in Alaska too.   The bomber shelter could be a shed someday.  I saw your video with Marty Rainey, very good, and you were talking about your son and the land.  Thanks for sharing your life on YT.  Stay safe  Love you guys
Wonderful video of your travels,  saying “so long” to your Son and setting him off more than prepared for his new and independent life/adventure!  Great job you two. FYI…two hours of backhoe work  could bury that “bunker” and significantly improved the totality of the property…just saying.  Just my opinion.  It yours, so do as you see fit.
Great video guys, 👍
Your Gypsy wagon is the cutest thing you’ve ever built! I’m inspired to create one of my own for trips from NC to Colorado, my second home ☝️✨💗
Good to know you all made it safe ... God Bless you & yours.
How in the world do you keep your dog from running off?
In my side of the world concrete houses are the norm. I am having a reverse dilemma whether to do a concrete cabin like everyone or a stick house like you side of the world. I am still deciding.  😮😮😮
I would say the dirt inside the cabin is from the chimney.
It might work well for a storage space. Congrats to Mic on his property and new adventures!  What new adventures are you and Dave going to do now?  By the way Micks got a great voice he could use it to make some money. Voice over or video games, movies. Just a thought. What a great future you all have coming...
Your son should be in your channels list . 😊
Thank you for creating content that I can show my young children. They love to see your projects, Moose and your adventures! They learn a little bit too! Thank you so much!! We're a family of fans of your family's channels!!
I’d throw a peaked roof with extra overhang and a steel door on the bunker and solar and turn it into a workshop. Maybe add a garage door and a big Jackery and a power generator over time. That way you have a place for chainsaws, shovels, power tools and tool storage. Maybe even a dehumidifier, with external drainage.  That way it can be rough and stay rough—and you won’t feel guilty beating the tar out of the room. All tools need a place to go. You don’t want to constantly haul them in the vehicles and you don’t want them in the cabin.
Turn that concrete building into a greenhouse or a garage for motorcycle and junk. Just needs a roof and door.
Love it all....Good to see your journey went well and you are ready for more adventures. Maybe the survival bunker should stay just that.....new roof and restock her up in case you every need somewhere to go. Even if you build another cabin there....an emergency backup shelter is always good to have. Best Wishes Whipple family
make it a guest cabin
One thing Parents don't plan for is the Children moving out. We plan for them to grow up & it ends there. Tears when it happens. You feel not needed anymore. A lot of emotions. One thing though is you worry less about them. Thanks for another great video.
I drove with my son from Georgia to Bozeman, MT for his first trip to Alaska. I couldn't travel with him across the border since it was the height of the pandemic. He spent his first winter up there this year and it looks like he'll stay. (He met s girl up there 😁) He started his third season as a fly fishing guide a few weeks ago. You've encouraged me to take a trip all the way there by truck and I may just build your vardo to take with me. I'm not sure there would be anything left of my '60s toaster camper by the time we got it all the way up there...
Best wishes for everyone! I think that would make an awesome shed. Build a nice extra solid roof and door and you won’t have to worry about anything you put in there! Good luck 🍀
With your kids grown and graduated, what are your plans for future? Leave Michigan lower peninsula? That shelter could be a storage building.
I would knock the bunker down and be done with it, it's such an eyesore and its creepy history.
My wife just loves your Vardo. You did excellent work building it. Hauling it all the way to Alaska is definitely the acid test. You and Dave saying goodby to Mickey made me choke up. My prayers and best wishes go with him as he embarks on his great adventure of life. You and Dave did well as parents. Have a Blessed Summer.
I feel bad for people who don't know about Tim Hortons
how long is your trailer
Awesome! God bless you all! And He surely has and continues to! So precious is His love! And it's so beautiful seeing God's plan unfold in all your lives! I say just take that depressing concrete bunker and transform it into a beautiful one of a kind hand painted piece of beautiful art in the woods! Like a brilliant sunset behind mountains or anything lush and full of life and color and beauty that covers the entire thing!!!!! 🌄🤍🙌💞🌻🦋🏕🌅
I just drink Aldi instant coffee tastes great
HEY GIRL quick tip for dust - CORDLESS LEAFBLOWER!!!!!! HAPPPY 25
One of my dreams is this but minus saying goodbye to my son
Wow! You never know what the weather n travel can do to a trailer till you test it out.  Hope you all have the best blessings over you.
such beautiful scenery!! ive been meaning to comment on the last few videos, that Dog is so darn funny and cool. he cracks me up every time
Hi guys. Maybe not dust but ash from the folded chimney? Deb from Oz
I hate seeing nearly abandoned vehicle or 4 rusting on a beautiful piece of land
I love your blogs and the tiny Wagon home!!! What breed is Moose?? He's so adorable!! Aww Congrats on 25 yrs!! That is incredible cause most don't last a few yrs anymore!! And Congrats to your son, WOW what a view!!!
I was almost crying when you said goodbye to Micky.  I always love to see the wildlife.  Happy Anniversary!
must be awesome to have parents that did something with their life. I wish I got some land from my parents
"Thanks for all the guiding". Perfect statement if ever there was one.
Have y'all thought about a trail cam set up in the cabin while you're not there? Glad to see y'all back in Alaska.
Our youngest is a senior this year.  Cheering you all on! Well done, Brooke & Dave.  I keep telling myself the best adventures are ahead of us ❤ ... it sure has been fun so far.  Idea for the bunker.  Hoop house foundation for raised bed greenhouse.  Extend that growing season 🌱
you still have that bunker structure? not the most welcoming sight even if fixed: but even if a completed basic dwelling able to be lived in again (slept in even) i guess could be rented out is what i might be tempted to do if was mine. was a biggee job watching you do the clean out.
Bunker...... throw a roof on it, seal up one door. Storm shelter and/or secure storage for bike, vehicle batteries, etc
Would be an awesome long term short term food storage and bunker
Could you not have lent/given your son your wee wagon to stay in while he builds on his land ? X
What type of bunker is that I've never seen or heard of something like that . Could you or someone explain it to me I'd appreciate it . Thank you .Btw outstanding video . Tell your son welcome back home !
hey: not meaning to critisize; but i never talk with people who wear sunglasses, even listen to them and move to sometning else when your dave is talking at camera wearing his. is like oh look a manniquin
I am curious…do you get compliments on Vardo from people? Brooke I love that you have bits of nature in everything you do including the flowers in the truck. I am the same way.
i feel for you in numerous of your life: your son moving away from home; your maisie retired, (decided not to do the list...overdue some zzzs) adapting to above is a big heart stretcher as is just put you on in time to watch your son drive off. i guess that is part of how my eldest brother david and recently deceased wife felt: when their youngest adult child everettt moved away from area; now married and working around nz building, tiny houses.
I just found his channel like two days ago and binge watched all his videos. When I saw the back end of the wagon in this video I thought that looks just like the one from his video of the drive over. But I was like no it couldn't be. I'm so happy it is. Honestly him going to live in Alaska in the woods in a cabin he built himself makes so much more sense knowing he is your kid.
Empty nesters...  it's a strange feeling that I can not described.  Bitter-Sweet maybe.  I forwarded your son's videos to my nephew who will graduate next year, he enjoys them.  Take Care you all. ❤
It is my dream to drive Rambi my van from East Jordan, MI to Alaska. My husband is not interested, and my friends are discouraging. I've been driving back and forth between Wyoming and Michigan since I'm 18. (I'm 60 now!) I figure if i can drive that many times across Nebraska, I can drive anywhere, lol!!  Maybe it will have to be a solo trip.
Maybe use skylights in the bunker opposed to windows!
Looks beautiful! Good Luck to your son.   This spring I tried a Thermacell while bear hunting to keep the mosquitoes at bay and it seemed to work fairly well. I think I'm going to get a bigger one for camping with the wife. All is good here in Idaho, lots of work on remodeling our house, but also lots of camping breaks. Cheers to you and Dave.
Love the gypsy wagon, btw!
What about a bathroom in the bunker?
Thanks for sharing such a special moment in your family. It’s fantastic that your son has chosen to perpetuate the life style you raised him in. It’s a high compliment to you both.
I have to admit I teared up a little bit when bushradical said bye I love you son! What a beautiful video! Someday i would love to get up there. I have family in Ketchikan Alaska.
It's been a joy watching yur son with his start in life!! To bad the neighbor guy is an @ss!! I went thru 3 mths of empty nest syndrome all i did was cry when my youngest left home!! I Love the Gypsy wagon for sure!! It's really pretty up there!! Thanks for sharing!!    ❣❤❣
Good one Brooke!! 😊
Thank you for this video! The scenery was unbelievably stunning!!
I love that wagon you made. It looks cool.
Welcome back, hope to see you around! Of course the gypsy wagon made it, your a great builder. Watching you say goodbye to your son made me tear up. So happy your cabin, vehicles and property are good, other than the pesky squirrel stuff. Looking forward to your videos up here!!! Get outside and be happy ❤
👌🏻👍🏻❤🙏🏻What a beautiful family you are. I watch all 3 chanels and love it! Love and greetings, Sara from South Africa🇿🇦
It’s unfortunate that the bison farm is being less than cooperative with your son in regards to not allowing the use of the road, but he’ll adapt and overcome this obstacle.    Squirrels….the war with those little tree rats is NEVER over.   The block house…a 40-yard roll-off dumpster and a skid steer loader seems logical. That structure is akin to a snowman made of Limburger cheese…it stinks, it’s not inviting and will never make sense.   An early Happy Anniversary to yourself and Dave, coming up on the 27th year anniversary with my own wife.    Between yourself and your husband’s YT channels(and now your son’s), it’s inspired me at 49 years old to reconnect with the outdoors and to slow down my workaholism….
Hello :
At 8:38 Cool shoes.  Happy 25th anniversary.   Hmmm, I thought the survival bunker was in upper Michigan - My bad.  Would it be worth the effort to turn that bunker into a root cellar/storage?
Thanks for sharing your adventurous journey to Alaska with your son, he’s gonna do great and has a vision for his dreams to be fulfilled! Glad y’all made it safe and sound ❤. Love your little hideaway.
Propper roof and it would be a good place to store a motorcycle.
WOW amazing scenery! Loved this 'van blog' 😍
I am so glad I happened onto a more recent video, congratulations to you both on your 25th anniversary.
thank you ❤
Storage shed is a good idea.   No sense wasting the effort that went into it, and having a place to put extra things to keep them out of the weather can be useful in perpetuity.
Very cool Brookster!
I know it's hard to say goodbye when your children grow up. I had to do that with my 5 kids. But you've done the best things you can do and teach them how to survive on their own, and be the best person they can be. Your block house you could use as a shop/storage place as you build the cabin you want and where you want to. Of course, you would at least want a roof and doors on it.
Who is Mazzie staying with ??ok I read where she is with your daughter … we miss the beautiful woof ..🤗🐾🧸
Put a metal roof on the survival bunker and use it as a storage shed!
Turn it into a shed maybe
That "bunker" can me a good and strong enough storage, at maximum, because it is poorly built and looks ugly. No need to waste your money and energy on something, if you can do it better during the exact same amount of time. Thank You for video! Best wishes!  PS: And thanks for sharing part of Your life with us, in some cases You are the best example we can find.
moose gonna sink your boat.. know any good drowning songs lmao
If you fix it up you could rent it out.
You could use that bunker to burn all the wood.  Its hard to say goodbye to your choldren, bit you know you've done a good job when they're comfortable enough to be on their own.  I'm sure mom and dad will be hearing from him soon asking for help and ideas.
Hey sister in Christ. You are my spirit animal LOL!! You are amazing. Love your videos. They are a point I want to get to God Willing. I'm a gardener and animal person by nature, but at this point stuck in an apartment. Your videos give me joy, knowing what can be if that is what The Lord wants for my life. God Bless your family.
There's just so much cuteness you see from Moose though💙, can probably have his own channel,.you know talking for hi,./the cutest expressions on his face so adorable..
You must go thru a lot of tires
I would get rid of the bunker its not inspiring you..a storage shed might be good
What are you gonna do with the bunker?
Shelter would make a good shed when u put a tin  roof on.   The vardo took a kicking but u drove thru some colossal weather maybe some watch vanish to protect her ?
She sounds and looks more like a local camping trip girl (your camper)
😆👍👌There they are...infamous red pants😆 (never stop being you Brooke) @2:26 .... uuu take the WHOLE frame grrrrl, hehe we are sooo cheeky.
You can leave it as a shelter.  Bottom room, for food and supply storage.  Build a flat deck on top or/and a wooden enclosure with kitchenett, room for living small, a real shelter
Looks like ash from fire blown back when chimney snapped off .
The land drill looks good.  Good luck to Mick with his new adventure of building on his new land.  I will be a subscriber to his channel to give him support.  I can see how it will be a big decision on what to do with the bunker, Brooke.  But,  you'll make the right choice 😉.  God bless 🙏🏾❗🦋🍎
Why is there so many vehicles n th property. ?
Hey Brooke🎉
Maybe use it for a mini garage for equipment,  the motorcycle firewood?
WOW!!! Bittersweet is right😢😅, and your little vardo did really well, nice to see you using it, it's absolutely adorable out there, and looks really cozy, as for that cement block well, I'm sure you'll figure something out, A guest bunker? I love that little stove in there you're going to have to do something with it, all the work you took and cleaning it out, it's worth some more effort,  just to enjoy!!!😊 Happy camping!!!✌️❤️, Get happy camping!!!😅
Hi. Thanks for the video. Wondering if a shed might be for the concrete building. Give it to Dave to do.😀
Супер👍☝️🙂
👍👋
Betting on alaska...I just came apon your son's channel....before this video came out .....seen his videos so far of clearing his land...love the designs on your tiny camper.  👍 I watch all if you now ...husband and son and of course your Channel.And I Loved your guys on ALONE.
That concrete bunker reminds me of a prison cell.
Thanks again for this.  I am trying to get to the end of yr videos before a comment.  But there you are at the end again with a view of the bunker.  All the work that you've done.  Could some "tree clearing" happen to make it's location a bit more acceptable. And lots of work here.  Many "properties," many "projects."   Seems like you guys are setting up various "camps" rather than long term living situations.  That theme for me is really cool.   And so.  Many "opportunities."  ~ Inspirational ~ Just Imagine.  Thank you.  ✨🌸✨
Weird. I've been watching your son's channel not knowing you were his mom. No wonder I like him. :-)
Where is Daisy
It's worth saying again... Maysie is fine! She's retired. We don't have a vehicle that would make it comfortable for her to take this drive. She's too old for most adventures. She's in good care with our daughter in the meantime. I appreciate all the well wishes and care for the LEGEND.... DA WOOF! Long live DA WOOF! xoxo Thanks for watching!
Omg! I didn't realize he was your son! I'm subscribed to his channel! Wishing him all the best!
another fun update curious to see how the cabin goes I somehow thought it was done XD
You have a beautiful family have been watching your channel for a long time you and your husband and now your son has his going you have a very interesting family and enjoy watching as you are grow.. God bless your family and looking forward to all your ventures
It's hard watching your baby birds leave the nest. He was raised right. The bunker just doesn't seem to fit y'all.  I think storage or knock it down.
You raise them right, then let them make their own decisions and live life the way they wish!  Good job mom and dad <3
Great video! Spiked that 👍🏽  Also, 2:21 the stained glass looks like a masonic symbol, you guys, part of a lodge?
Turn the concrete bunker into a summer work shop where you can do things for the property by putting screens on the Windows and a clear plastic roof well supported of course? Just a thought. I see potential but not for a winter place for anything but maybe bear proof storage? Your property is beautiful and I'm genuinely surprised at the great property your son has for a sight unseen place it's pretty awesome! Happy trails and safe travels to you and your hubby and Moosey.
she gone  :)
I would so love to meet you and have a coffee  Love your videos and adventures. If you ever stop at the mile zero I’d be happy to visit❤️!
Brooke, I know you are happy for him, shoot he is beyond happy! I would bet ya, he makes it happen! What I wanta know is when you seen him drive away ....did you 😢. Shoot I did when Dave said, “I love you son.”
Your video's r so calming enjoy them all
Dave's a died in the wool Furd,which rhymes with turd,fanatic,while she is a chebby fan so far as I have seen the past half dozen years or so... Can they survive the Furd vs Chebby feud? Tune in next month when we answer the age-old question of which make is not quite, or almost as good as a Toyota or Dodgè?? 😂
How many miles been your Sons place and yours?
😁👍❤😎
Blessings and joy to you the next 25 years!
There are zero Buffalo on the North American continent other than those in captivity, i.e.,zoos,private refuges,private owners... There are only bison and a very few water buffalos... Yahhhh.. Google it..
I really look forward to your videos !  nice way to  relax and enjoy my Sundays
Definitely a storage unit for the concrete building. Maybe for the bikes and equipment? Wonderful episode. Good luck to your son and congratulations on his graduation.
I love all of your adventures wherever you go . Excited for your son and his adventures too .💕😊🙏
🤘🏻😎🤘🏻 Awesome stuff Brooke
I miss da woof.. 😮 Keep hoping to see her in each and every video on both channels,but alas,no...😢
Love this!
Love love love this one!!!
Awesome Camper!!!
Nice work Brook on the  gypsy wagon to make her road worthy looked great , You and Dave have done a fine job on raising Mick he is doing so well for himself buying his first property and  clearinng the land for his cabin he will do well Never say good by , just say see ya again. or so long.  I am sure that construction didnt help your trailer. your poor cabin with those squirrels  guess it could be wose . Alaskan property is so beautiful. Yes you could eventually use the bunker for storage in the future . Lovley video Brook. Love Mick's Channel. Ontario Canada .
❤
Put as much dry foods as you can in glass jars. Squirrels & mice can’t  get to it.
Use the bunker as a basement and have an elevated cabin. Or  just put a roof on it and some stout doors to use as secure storage.
Make it a storage shed. When snow is deep, it might be high and dry.
Happy Anniversary you two ❤❤❤
18 and owns his own land, that’s fantastic! You’ve raised a responsible young man and I’m sure he’ll do fine if he’s already smart & wise enough to buy land and build a house on it. Hard part is letting go, especially your youngest. 😢  As far as the bunker goes, I’d make it a storage shed, it would be a solid little shed.
Just a thought, but do you suppose  the broken flu pipe allowed a back draft into the stove and that was ash  all over things? I  have no doubt that your Son has a super strong foundation under him that You and Dave provided! I wish him the best of luck! You all have a good week comin up!
Can definitely see a lot of Dave in Mickie.  Very nice property you guys must be so proud of him. ❤
Honestly, i dont care for the property with that cinderblock building-- its spooky, & it creeps me out😱, even when you 1rst showed it, i was like, heck- no😬😳
I'm sure the squirrels 🐿️ would love 💞 to have those stale peanuts 🥜!
Great idea for your screen! Love the vardo!
Im a single mom and Empty Nest Syndrome was horrible the first few years.  I'm so glad you two have each other.  God Bless your family !!!!
Can ya tell me what size trailer you built it on thanks in advance
I can remember when you cleaned out that bunker.  What a mess it was.   You both were great guides for both your children.   Is Maize still doing ok?  She was one of the big reasons I first checked out your channel.  And then your faith and your outdoor life drew me in.  God bless.
Camp to camp; Full circle baby.  That was SO sweet to hear your epiphany.   Thank you.  Ya did good ya did.  ❤😊❤
25:00 I, too, was thinking a storage building, but as long as it has a fuel smell, you don't want to be spending much time in there. I can't think of any fumes that are healthy. 💖🌞🌵😷
He kids voice! Holy cow deeeeeeeep! Lol ❤
Use a winch to pull the wall over, then bury.
Bunker looks like a jail.....no positive vibes off of it. Leave it as a monument to someone's eccentricities.  Looks haunted and desolate.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🥰
oh my gosh....i love moose so much!!! i REALLY DO MISS "du wuff" THOUGH AND WORRY ABOUT HIM...LOVE YOUR VIDEOS...
I usually don’t  give my opinion on what I think . But here it goes , About the cement block building . Because of the toxic oil spills , you wouldn’t bother . You will have to dig out all the soil because of the oil spill .
Goodbyes sure put a lump in the throat
Ohhhh bittersweet for sure 😢❤
Y’all are all just so amazing, loving and wonderful in so many ways ❤️🥰❤️
So good to see you kids going of on their whew . You both did a amazing job raising your son. He will do great.
Concrete Bunker as a Storage Shed sounds like a good use for the building.
So, does your son have a YouTube channel I can subscribe to?
The sound of Dave's voice when he said "love you son"  just melted me.   Such love in this family.  What good parenting. This is just great to see.
This video made me happy! Thank you.
Please watch out for bears!!   We live on our homestead in Maine (no grizzlies, but black bears and moose).  It's important to keep a powerful rifle nearby, just in case.  Three people have been attacked and kld by black bears this year in the lower states.  One was a hiker who emptied their can of bear spray on the bear that ate them anyway.  The other was a young guy living in a trailer. He only had a 22, and as the bear tried to get in overnight, he shot him multiple times through a window, but all it did was make him angrier, and he got in and ate him.  Very scary.  A 3rd was a guy in the Montana  (I believe) who was camping on his land, where he was building a cabin. He was sitting at his camp table drinking his morning coffee when he was attacked from behind and kld.  So PLEASE be careful.  Situational Awareness is key.  Don't let the camera distract you to the point that you're not looking around and behind you.   ❤
Your young man is a chip off the old block. You should be very proud. Subscribed to his channel. Excited to see his journey!
Knock it down, use the blocks to fill in holes on the property or whatever brook , if your not feeling it as a fixer upper or anything get rid of it and move on to better projects
The gypsies probably had that much trouble too.
You could turn it into a bathhouse and sauna
You and Dave are wonderful.
Always so happy when there is a new video! My theory about how the inside of the cabin got dirty and dusty is when the chimney was ripped off, air came in and brought fine particles of ash form the inside of the chimney. It's a guess. Thanks again, for such a fun series of adventure in beautiful nature!
Ty for the update my youngest is 25 now they grow up so fast enjoying your story has been a blessing best to you this summer 😻
You answered your own question about the old derelict bunker.. It is not in sync with your artistic self,  but perhaps may serve as a safe confined space to slowly burn all the wood waste when weather permits burning. It was wonderful to see that your Vardo and your son both made the long trip to Alaska safely. Now the new adventures begin again for all of you.
ahhhh, but what a ride!!!
0:31 use paper clips or clothes pins to hold  the shades up. 💖🌞🌵😷
So far from home. You will miss this boy.
I started following him before I knew he was yours! What an awesome young man he is. Congratulations on raising an excellent human 😊
I hope he still has his samurai  sword 😊
They gotta fly. Just like we did😊
🐿🐭 They need love too.
I'm thinking it would make a very dry and secure storage shed with a roof on it. Maybe pull down one wall and put in a garage door.
Hi Brooke.  Your vardo  held up really well. Nothing like having a nice place to sleep when traveling so far. Your son has picked a beautiful piece of land . I hope it will bring him a lot of joy living there.  And moose is always a hoot 😊
Exciting
I do not have the time to tell you how much I enjoy the content, you Dave and Ryan put out. I have a typical boring 9-5. I definitely live vicariously through you all. I love your builds, I love your well videos and even just the sitting around the fire videos. Please continue doing what you are doing. Edit (after this video, now following and watching Mick!!)
Always bittersweet sending off your kids! Somas you’re up at here with him when he’s getting started - for your sake more than his. Subscribed and watched all his videos so far. He’s full of energy, confidence and has a great work ethic! It’s going to be fun watching him! Good job mama bear!
You should try painting the lower metal bits with that rhino liner bed liner paint, maybe that will hold up better.
Looks like you raised him right! I would make that concrete structure a storage. Maybe a metal roof?
Where is your old pup?
You're both amazing parents.  Safe travels.
Moose is so adorable, I have a Corgi also, and they are so loyal and such a joy.
Just my $0.02 worth I have been watching both of your channels for a couple years and love The Innocence and cleanliness of all of the videos. I like it when both of you are involved in the videos, it just takes the next level.
Best of everything for you and your family.
Thats great 25 years wish i had found that in life & congratulations to the boy good luck & god bless
I love this video!!
Enjoyed this video. Glad ya'll made it there safe w/ everything in tact. Mickey is going to do great things. He had two wonderful teachers! That old bunker would make a great storage  place for things (like the motorcycle) while you're in the UP. Moose looked so happy chasing squirrels LOL.  Did Da WOOF stay back in the UP with your daughter?  Good video 😊
💙
Glad to hear you all are happy and healthy and doing what you want, where you want to do it! Peace to All...💜💙💜
Looking at that old "bunker" if the walls are solid... I would put a floor, walls and roof on top, if one side of the wall was weaker than the other I would build a lean to carport having it attached to the weaker side. Maybe if you don't like it give it to your son to work on and keep?
Life has come full circle! What a beautiful thing! ✌️❤️😁🤙
There's nothing quite as gritty as a wet corgi with a dirty stomach 😂 The hazards of being a lowrider 😉
Glad Vardo kept you guys comfy on the road.  You did a good job with construction.  A few minor tweeks, some elbow grease and it will be back in business.  Same with the cabin.  Your son's deep voice sounds like a natural voice over for documentaries.  I watch his channel, too.  Look forward to your next video.
What about using the bunker as a walled garden? Raised beds. Clear roof?
Bet y'all are excited to be back in Alaska!!
Around the back door on the trailer blue painter's tape may help on the Dust
I'm glad you get to drive through my home province of BC
You could use bunker as a lower level of a tree house style build. But you can never have enough storage
OH THATS BEAUTIFUL LAND!!!
❤️👵😇
As a viewer It’s hard to now how far the Concrete building is from ur campsite or cabin, but kinda shouts storage shed & storm emergency shelter? 🤷‍♀️ It’s yucky as a living space due to the tremendous amount of work to make it pleasant/nice. God will tell you what to eventually do w/it.  I gave 👍 on another viewer’s comment concerning ur son. No parent is perfect, but Great job raising him. Praying he will be careful and not get injured. No doubt he’ll make a great homestead for himself. What is ur son’s YouTube Channel?
Watching this made me so homesick for Alaska and for Delta! So amazing that your kiddo has such a wonderful  peace of land.. we are dreaming of moving back too. I would totally make the bunker into a sauna. Not sure how far it is from your cabin, but it could work
Nice to see Mose has a privileged seat with a view.
You may consider an Incredible Tiny Homes@IncredibleTinyHomes for your son.
Question was you on alone 😊❤❤😊
Wowie~Wow, Alex! You, Melissa and your kiddos have quite  the swanky  place ! So glad to see things are coming along at a good pace , as well as, in the way you wanted all of it to go!  Very nice! Did you find your frisky forest friend yet?!? Good to see your new, ' neighbor ' has taken you in like you were family, I say! ( Referring to the squirrel here !). Peace to All... 💜💙💜
Don’t you love Canada soooo much?
Where is your other Dog?
When Moose was on the screen at about 2:58, my 10-month-old rough collie, Mack ran over to the TV, put his front paws on the TV stand so he could stand up and get his nose right up to the screen to watch Da Moose! 😅
Ah I love it Brooke. It’s so fun watching Mick on his channel. 🥳🥳🥳
Happy Anniversary ✨️
❤
I bet the dirt came from the inside of stove pipe. When it   broke off the wind blew all the ash & dirt around.
Thank you for sharing your lovely family!
Storage building possibly. Store the bike and land tools.
I'd put a roof on your bunker and use it for dry storage for anything you leave up there. You need to make yourself a metal lined cupboard for any foods you're leaving up there over winter making sure it has an actual lock on it so animals can't get into it. I'm surprised they didn't chew up your blankets to make nests. Did you figure out how they got in?
I think the bunker would make a great workshop. Doesn't have to be as buttoned up as a house but could shelter things and tools.
🤔Put all your soft stuff in plastic bags,put them in metal chests,and hang old socks with moth balls in them in the cupboards closets,& by doors and any entry ways.they keep out bears  , racoons, squirrels, rats ,mice, skunks, possums, & just about ALL CRITTERS & Bugs.😇
Where is your other dog?
We have a steel drum for all our food. It is ugly but it keeps the critters out and I know I always have food at camp
Brooke and Dave, what are your thoughts on your son’s neighbor not allowing him access to the road that runs next to his property?  I’m sure it must be annoying his neighbor won’t give him an easement until his house is built.  Just wondering if either of you had any thoughts or advice on what he should do moving forward?
How did squirrels get in?
Great job mom and dad
Love your videos so much and Alaska is now on my bucket list.
Welcome to empty nest group. As odd as it sounds having the baby is easy compared to them growing up and want to be independent. I remember I wanted advice from my parents. But my daughter didn't. I just assumed they would ask for my opinion. But they didn't. Mine are mid to late 30s. An old adage of the kid couldn't believe how the dad grew in intelligence from when he was 19 to 23. It is a bit painful that we want to continue to try to pass on what we struggled to learn. Maybe that's part of why boys were attached to an apprentice to learn a trade instead of dads??? Kids gone gets easier just grow in the love you have for each other. 🙏
You guys are such a great team and family unit! Love you guys!❤
8:37 I LOVE those boots! What are they? Also do they hold up or are they just adorable? You seem like you buy things to last so I'm curious. They look suede, but I can't tell.
Use the bunker for any livestock in the future. It don't have to be fancy for live stock.
you need to pan the dirt for gold?
Love seeing the canadian flag on Americans. Live the channel
A really good video Brooke, you guys sure did a great job raising your children. Your son seems very mature and knowledgeable. Thanks for sharing…
You do realize we're in retribulation right. If you haven't taken Jesus as your savior now is a good time and stay repentant he could show up at any time.
I have said it on here before,   you guys are just  amazing people.    You make people happy and entertained.   That is a win in my book.    I love Moose but boy do I ever miss Maisie.    I hope she is enjoying her quieter life.    Just never change and stay safe.
If I was you I'd use for storage, put a slanted shed roof so it sheds the snow in the winter. With brick walls it can be quite the secured place to put tools, building supplies and more.
Thanks for your vid 😇💟💟💟 Love and bless you guys.
Reminds me of when I moved long distance to Wyoming when I was 22.  Great adventure!
Hello!" You two!" How are you?It was so nice meeting your Son Mickey And happy he made it home.I know your happy to be back at your Cabin even though there's some damage to it, outside and inside, with the squirrels and dust.I like the Cabin it's cute. The land is beautiful. Thanks for sharing everything I really enjoyed the video. Until the next video I will be waiting.😊
I love your camper
Could put top on it and use to store bike and stuff.
Time to add snow breaks on the chimney side!
You two should write a book or two, one on how to find property, tools you'll need, cabin ideas. It would be so cool
"you gota keep up with the chalk, you gota keep it really nice and soild"   That's what she said!    Hahahaha     sorry I'm a child, at least at heart.
Could the block shelter just be a storage building?  Just put a roof on top for tools and things.
The bunker is similar to the huts that we have seen on some Iranian nomad channels.  There is some potential for that bunker.
It would be great for a tool and work shop.
That bunker had a lot of character you should keep it as original as possible slap a roof on it put some bunkbeds and let people stay in the bunker when they come to visit or for yourselves to stay now and then.  I think  it would be cool to keep it as much original as possible!!
Wow... So cool to see Mickey wanting to follow in his parents footsteps!! He's a good kid... I'll sub his channel too!!
Hi Brooke ,Dave and moose happy Sunday, congratulations to Micky on his move pray everything works out for him, moose is having a ball ,thanks for sharing
Next year 50 years married. Honeymoon camping in bright orange van. You all stick together. It's not fun empty nest but they multiply and come back with more and more. We have great grandchildren
You have a really good sin.  You and Dave have been great parents, gently teaching him to be on his own.  Best of luck to Mickey and to you and Dave.  Little one seems to really be enjoying himself too.
Wondering how far he lives from you now?   Your son, i mean
Definitely a storage shed.
A video from Dave AND Brooke today?!?! It's a good day! ❤
Any chance of sharing the route you drove up there?  I would love some of those pit stops!
Your son sounds lot like Dave! 😁 Maybe this question is unanswerable but how the heck did squirrels get inside the cabin? I’m fixing up a 70-year-old lakeside cabin here in Nagano and trying my best to avoid such a situation.
The bardo did great, you built it to last! ✌🏼❤️🙏🏼
Respect.....as I once said we only have one property on the Laramie range of Wyoming. Winter's are very harsh. We have 35 acres. We'd like to buy more around us to create a buffer farther away from others when we can. We are full Time here so it's never ending projects. I totally agree, the cinder block building may make a good storage building eventually. I'd put it on the back burner for awhile perhaps. Love what y'all do. Sending many blessings to y'all n you're son on his new adventures. We will look for him at betting on Alaska. God Speed.
I remember when y’all first bought that bunker and you cleaned it out.  I can understand your dilemma completely.   If you have a better spot on the property you want to be &  you don’t like the feeling there , follow your gut instinct and knock it down.     What an awesome young man Mickey is .   He has a goal in mind, and he is willing to work hard to achieve it.   I will follow his channel.   I’m excited for him.
Enjoyed the video, beautiful scenery 😊❤ Thanks for sharing 😊❤
Great pictures of Alaska! Would love to visit there.❤
I would build a full cabin on top of the bunker. With properly placed windows and entrance from below.  Or maybe not.
Love this! I remember when i first came upon your channel. You and Dave were building the small one room cabin. Then you took the dogs and stayed the night. You made a reuben sandwich. I've been hooked ever since.❤❤
I:37 in, I wonder if you hinged the window cover at the bottom if it could double as a table?
Hi Brooke and Dave! Praise the Lord you all made it safely. I never miss a video from Mick. He is a very blessed young gentleman. God's love is all over your family. I love this property. I was sorry to see that the Vardo took a little beating. Yet what a great road test huh? I was also sorry to see the squirrels made a mess in your home. So much beauty and all of God's creation everywhere. I pray for you all daily. May the Lord bless you and fill your hearts with joy. To God be the glory forever and ever. Amen. Love in Christ ~John
well you never disappoint..so keep on keeping on....so proud of your gypsy wagon....
Make the bunker into a workshop and canning kitchen...
The bunker might make a good storage.
Where's da whoof? Haven't seen her in a bit.
Nothing to do with that bunker but turn it into a storage shed.  Very low priority, I’d say.
Be proud! It’s hard to let them go! When my middle son joined the marines, I cried. When he was deployed I cried again. It’s very hard on a mama’s heart! Hugz! 🙏🏻❣️🖖🏻
Love the Whipple day on utube!  NGL, I got choked up when your boy went on his way…I thought about what your parents must have been thinking when you made your way as a young woman.  You and Dave done good, and I know it is hard to let him figure things out.  He grew up with you two, so he will do fine.  He’s got Dave’s wry sense of humor, too.  Thanks for letting us tag along, sweet girl!  And yes, you are still a girl.  I’m 70, and I am still a girl, at least in my mind.  P.s. ya’ll have some serious skeeters up there, my condolences on bug bites!
the bunker could make an amazing wood storage/drying space for very little effort. no need to fuss with the windows or anything just slap on a covering/roof. hell, in a pinch You can use those tarps you found in the treasure pile. then when you clear out all that fallen wood (and I'm betting there will be a crap ton on that property) you'll be set.
❤😊 Mickey, Congratulations 🥳 graduate👨‍🎓! May this adventure be amazing above and beyond all you could hope for. 🤗 Fran
Maybe the bunker could be a garage for the motorcycle and a truck or two for the winter
U folks r my kind of people! I've been  following u both for 2 yrs. I would love to live in a cabin off grid! Brooke u and Dave r amazing people!.love u guys and your videos!
Oh goodness Momma! Good Job! You raised a good one!!!! I can have faith in the future of this country with parents like you guys raising an incredible young men! This is the new era of STRONG and capable men who aren’t looking for a hand out, they are building their own future!     No victim mentality here just a strong work ethic and a desire to build his own destiny!
Always great to see your videos. Hard leave Mick, I know, but it is his time to "toil for his food."
the bunker house is a great food and equipment cache. with a bullet proof roof system.
Think some of that dirt might be from the chimney coming off?
Ashes blew back in from the stove? Broken chimney issue on the dirt.
That’s your son!!! I watched his video last week and subscribed to see how he comes along. I thought what a wonderfully wise young man. Now I can see why!
I'm glad your trip turned out so well for you & ur son . Welcome back to Alaska 🤠
Lucky you—my son is back home working on his MBA and my daughter is working on her nursing decree—in the words of bill Cosby—they come back!!!
Or a sauna?
I’d fix up the bunker but wouldn’t go crazy initially.  Roof, windows, doors, etc., nothing fancy.
A smokehouse?
Wow the whole family has YouTube channels! Going to subscribe and can't wait to see what he does with it.
This was bitter  Sweet! Your Son will have your prayers to guide him, along with so many of us who will be  praying with you, for him!  Gods Bless all of you! 🙏🕊️🙏
If I may offer an idea for the survival bunker.  If I had the privilege of owning it, and didn't want to do much with it. I'd open up one wall and park a camper inside it and replace the wall that was removed to make enough room to fit the camper inside the four walls and then camouflage the outside walls to hide the entire structure.   But that's something I might do.
Sorry there was such stuff for you guys to do. God, Bless you both.
Greenhouse...🤔 possibly  take the concrete block walls down to about 3 ft, then build up from there with plastic sheeting. Or how about an above ground concrete swimming pool 🤣
I agree winter storage the bunker would be great
You've probably already thought about this, but could you finish off the bunker just enough to use as a storage shed? Just roof and windows?  I don't know anything much about building, like you two do... just wondering if it could be useful.
What a nice young man you have raised. You must be so proud.
In the bunker jus put some kind of roof n make it a nice sitting are maybe a picnic table chairs fire pit in center jus some kinda mesh screens for doors like a tent door maybe???
Awesome quilt top! Did you sew it?
Cement it completely up, build a deck all around it and fill it up with water!! Your own swimming hole!!
Why not use the bunker as a tool shed. Put a roof on it keep your gardening supplies Etc
Happy Silver Anniversary to an awesome couple! Sad letting go but you'll always be a family. Your wagon held up better than i feared! Onward and upward...👍😎🇨🇦⚘💫⭐🪶🙏
Why not use the bunker as a grudge put a roof on it and store your tools and gardening supplies Etc
Planning to return home to Alaska. I'm 72 and want to spend the final years home
Good to hear all your hard work making this trailer paid off. It is beautiful.😄👍❤️
I love seeing the videos with you two together!!!!  ❤
I love seeing the videos with you two together!!!!  ❤
Wow! I’ve been feeling like a road trip!!!😊
Rats n squirrels but idk bout dust weird.
I love the blue and grey hues!
Brook the survival building has a negative  feeling to me from here! I wouldn't want to do anything with it
He looks like you Brooke 😊
Make it into a greenhouse with a plastic roof. Would that work?
You and Dave's videos make me feel great no matter what kind of day I've had. A big thank you 😊
I love that chicken ladder....sorry about the varments
Aww I’m happy for y’all son! On your concrete building how about a greenhouse with see through roof in the fiberglass kind where sun can come thru and maybe habitat windows and do a concrete floor easy clean up and won’t rot.
Glad you all arrived safely , good luck to Mickey on his cabin build , im sure he will do just fine 😊 our kids are the same age so I can understand some of the emotions you would be feeling , enjoy your time in Alaska .😊
Pressure wash cement.
It so awesome that he said thanks for guiding him, I felt a sense of loss. It is hard to let go, but you both taught him well. He has two parents that survived many obstacles in your life and you both worked at it. I cried when he parted, but I have been watching his channel. Alaska is a beautiful place. Blessing to all of you.
I'm so happy to see you in Alaska with your husband. But it make me sad too. My husband and I was planning another trip but his sudden death changed all that. We were married 27 years. I doubt I could ever go back without him but seeing two of my favorite people there makes me happy♥️
One of the hardest moments of you life I'm sure
Great to see it come full circle.  I hope he talks about finding it price n shows all building as he goes. Ya'll are Awesome parents
Use butyl tape to seal seams, it lasts 30 to 40 years.
Our last (of the five) is now on his own. We did just have to go rescue him from a house issue he didn’t quite know how to handle. It’s a dance to not say too much and let them know they can depend on you. You guys are awesome.😊
You could just leave the bunker as it is while you work on your own ideas. In time its best use will come to you. There is no rush, so let it percolate.
Oh wow, I felt that when he drove off.  What a mixture of emotions you and Dave must have.  So happy for all of you.😊
Put under coating you use on vehicles and coat the wood and let it dry on the camper you built.
To plot thickens. Because I want you to finish well.
3900 miles how?   And what was that cinderblock building originally?  Love this vid and the love within you family, as well as you love for nature and your adventurist spirit!
Looks like the squirrels threw a frat party in there!😂 Nothing like a clean up party in your cabin to keep you from fretting over Mick and his property. I launched 6 kids and the last one is always the hardest to cut the strings on. Good thing you didn't have to stay in the U.P. while he went cross country on his first trip. That would have been unbearable! God watches over His own and Mick had the best teachers for his journey.
You could put a roof on that bunker, knock a wall out and use it to store your Bardo if you leave it in Alaska 😊
It looks like you broke in the gypsy wagon real good. That's what you built it for!
And off he goes to toil for his food! Great job mom and dad 😊😂😂 My kids did the same....they had no idea and I have to say, it was a little validating when I got the first  Omg mom.....and I admit that I laughed and laughed but they both did well and yours will too so be proud 😊
Those windows with the cement squares It would be cool to fill them with empty bottles and pack mortar around them the sun shinning through that would look beautiful
put two by sixes rafters get the clear plastic at home depot it last a lot longer than the clear from Lowes...experience....and then screen the windows and doors throw some more mortar on the floor cover up the old one and put some lawn chair wicker furniture in and you will have a summer house to get away from sketters and to read and relax...what would do....just saying!
i agree storage shed
Ain’t gonna lie you guys made a 55 year old man’s eyes water! Lol. Thx for the updates on the properties! Darn squirrels!
❤❤❤. You guys feed my soul. Got pretty choked up watching your son go his own way. Followed his channel after you told us about it on your previous video. Really wish I’d known stuff like this was an option when I was his age. Thanks to people like you guys and him, others will. Great video! Thanks Brooke and fam for sharing it. 🙏🏼☺️
How nice that you all went together to make sure he made it safely. I've never been to AK but when you said it was a slog, I believe you. I can't even imagine it. Driving from San Antonio through west TX is the worst I've experienced and I know that can't compare.  I wish his land had larger trees on it, to use for building material. I'm sure he'll find what he needs to create what he has envisioned in his mind. Very exciting days for him. Will the Vardo stay up there with him or did you plan to take it back home with you?   Has Moose ever caught one of those squirrels? I wonder what he'd do if he caught one. I think all dogs are obsessive about squirrels but I've never seen any of mine actually catch one. It's hard to imagine that they'd kill it but you never know when instinct will kick in.  Great video. Enjoyed it very much. As far as that old nasty bunker, the only thing I can think of to do with it is to make a barn out of it, but you aren't there long enough to get livestock, so there goes that notion. Maybe just leave it as is until it is revealed to you in a dream.
❤
You left a KLR up there all winter under a tarp?!?  Oh man, that would have kept me up at night.
Storage shed might be the best use for the bunker. It certainly would be sturdy. Block the windows in and put a decent roof and make it as critter proof as possible . You could store the motorcycle, tools and such. Definitely something to consider. You have plenty of time to think about it because it made it through the last winter just fine…maybe next year….?
I saw that lot and thought about buying it myself. Nice being close to a buffalo herd. That bug screen made me think of a late friend of mine. I went t his cabin one day[in 1974] 16x16 log and noticed smoke coming out between the chinking. Upon investigation I found that my friend had lit some BUHACK and the lid had somehow flipped on the can lighting the whole can while he slept. As far as he could figure[I woke him up] he had been asleep for two days. His poor dog EARL was in the corner trying to breath off the floor .He woke up hungry of course and after Earl had licked the frying pan clean he[my friend] proceeded to cook some eggs. Of course ever being the gentleman asked me if I wanted some. I wasn't used to his dishwasher so gratefully declined. I don't think you can buy Buhach anymore. I think the company went out of business. My friend who was about 20 then died at 60 and I still miss him. We had some lively times together. He had hitchhiked up here from Ohio when he was 17 .He had to have a note from his mother to get past the Mounties. When I came past the border in 74 you had to have 200 cash. Things were simple then. You could still squat.
💫
Yep, storage shed.
All the dust probably came from the squirrels messin with stuff
I joined your son's channel and I am looking forward to seeing him flourish.  What a great piece of property!!!!   I am been an empty nester since 2018.  I still miss not living with my daughter.  She has her own life with her boyfriend and lives 1.2 hours away from us.  I try to see her as much as I can.
😊💖🐶🐶
Storage shed makes a whole lot of sense.👍🏼
Glad you made it all safe and sound! congrats on 25yrs, and you're now officially empty nesters! It's tough knowing your babies are gone, but so rewarding seeing them become adults. That block building would certainly be a good bear proof storage building, with a good roof and steel doors. Or a basement for a bigger cabin on top. I imagine bear proof is a bonus.
Where is the wolf
This is great.  You both are together so much without your kids I often wonder where they are at.  I know they are older, but perhaps not fully grown up yet.  Where is Da Wuff though?  Maise must be lonely at home without you all.
Love the Moose !
I was wondering if you were going to post? The whipple family sunday on you tube. Great job guys.
It would make a safe secure storage shed
Happy anniversary this year you two! 👍❤️
Has your son thought about getting a cargo trailer to live in until he can get a cabin built?  He does have a nice canvas tent.
I have to say , I agree with you about that bunker building or whatever it is?  , It feels like bad energy for some reason.   Your property is nice though , and I love your Vargo (?). God bless 🙏
Your family is beautiful!❤
I'm Jackie from Chattanooga Tennessee. Where is Daisy May. Just haven't seen her in a while
More than 100 pages of land for sale for Arizona and less than one page for Alaska.
Haha, I KNEW that was your guys truck that Mick and his friend Sam were using Brooke, wasn’t 100% sure but now I know. Thankfully he’s watched yas first hand his whole life so I know he’ll do great. It IS beautiful eh, wow!  Glad yas made it safe and sound, have a great summer.  🙏❤️👋🇨🇦
You are Fabulous parents for letting your son do his own thing, including stumbling and getting back up. Bravo! 🎉
Welcome to the bittersweet beauty of the empty nest. It belongs to those of us who have done our jobs well. Happy Anniversary. Best of luck to your son!
Wow, you have raised  some awesome kids.. And the property you son choice is amazing,, just like you said.. and also I wanted to say congrats on 25 years of marriage and both your kids have graduated. 👍👍 Never been to Alaska,, it looks so beautiful there..thank you for sharing.
What are the greenery you have in the vase in the front of the van?
Awesome video, Brooke. The Vardo held up very well! If it can take the Alaskan Highway, it can handle anything! Moose and his squirrels. Such a goofball. As for the survival bunker... storage area does sound like a good idea. You'll figure something out. You always do. I've been following Mick as well, and I can't wait to see what happens. As always, take care and be safe. See you next time.
Empty nester now! Congratulations on a great job of parenting.
Absolutely loved this ❤
This is a great video! I needed it! I love it. ❤
how about a storage shed for the bunker? Once you put a good strong roof on it.
Squirrels hate peppermint! So when leaving just makes sure to put out peppermint things to keep them away! Under hoods too
Build an oasis for Dave and you to relax
Brooke great to see Dave and Mick.enjoyed the video.
❤he sped off
Your son is a doll! He’s such a nice guy to thank his parents for the guidance. Raised very well! Love it that you and Dave are getting to travel together. Awesome! Blessings always!  💔🙏🏼💔
It is fitting that your first night as empty nesters is at a campsite!  Well done, Brooke and Dave.
Make the bunker a oasis. Take your time with it❤️
We NEVER see squirrels any more (southeast CT near the river) or raccoons or opossums, and I don't know why? Kind of sad!
So happy for you. Mick is doing good. Dave is with you. And your baby girl. Stay safe lovely lady. Be seeing you soon.
What a beautiful place to be in Alaska! Exciting that your son is about to embark on clearing his property and building his own home. The gypsy wagon held up pretty well. Too bad your cabin in the Alaskan woods was infiltrated by squirrels and dust, but you both tidied it up and made it homey again. Moose will make sure that those pesky squirrels keep out! Your idea of turning the concrete building into a storage shelter sounds like a good idea. Thanks for another fun vlog! Jenny
I'd keep the concrete block building. It's already there and plenty of block laying around it looks like to patch the windows and maybe one doorway. Those windows would knock out easy with a hammer/chisel/masonry saw if needed and are very simple to patch in. If not enough block, 8" concrete block are like 1$ or so a piece, or could find some free online as well as some mortar. As a mason, that is an easy building to seal up wall wise and only have one door, which you already have leaning there. Or could buy a new one...up to you. Structure is mostly there, just gotta put a roof on it. JMHO, keep the vids coming! Love watching them!
You raised your children well, so you have a lot to be proud of.  I am sure his property will be truly grand once he's done.  I get a lot of squirrels in my yard too.  They rip out all my flowers-my new ones. So its either Repells All, or in the garage where sometimes they end up in the soffits (when I have the garage door open while cutting grass), I throw up some moth balls.  They hate them.  Enjoy your camping expedition and clean-up!
You need to walk away from the bunker.  Like you said so much work😢 in a place you don't want to be.  Love that the Vardo made it.  It is so cute. Enjoy your summer.  ❤
So excited for you all 🎉❤
Yes ya'll did a great job on your kids. We loved your video. In a survival situation, since you're  in bear country you may need to keep your flocks safe; maybe  a couple nanny goats in milk and a few chickens.
I stumbled across your sons most recent video and until now had no idea he was your son! When I saw him in this video I was trying to figure out why he looked familiar LOL. Y’all have done a tremendous job raising him, and should be proud.
Who planted all the trees ? They did a good job with row planting. Was that area previously harvested ? Very pretty scenery
You got your priorities right when you get your Timmy’s for the road! 🇨🇦
I think i would just take the front off that concrete thing and over time put some sort of a roof on it and use it as a garage,brick shed,it's not a good feeling type of building and definitely not one you would want to stay in that's for sure. I can imagine it's driving you daft wanting to get cracking on Mike's property 😂..its so hard isn't it,when my daughter moved into her rented house I was itching to get started on it but had to keep reminding myself it was her project and home...I feel for you and Dave I really do as you just want them set up and have it done right,but they know  how they want it and they have to put all their dreams and hopes in to reality and make it happen.  He will do just fine as he has the most knowledgeable wilderness  & homestead building parents ever! And has learnt alot I'm sure.  The vardo did brilliantly travelling all that way and practically unscathed 👍great job Brooke and the build not only looks brilliant the build itself is beyond durable 🙌,will you leave it there now or tow it back again when your done,it's a long haul back and forth.  A week each way...that's some miles covered.  Hope your managing to have a great time and catch up lots with Mikey. Sending momma hugs.
Nice traveling...always wonderful surrounding 😊
Where’s the other Doggie?
What happened yo Maisey?😢
It seems not that long ago that you didn't want Mickey to play with knives, now here he is out on his own. Wow.
Make it into a fallout shalter
How are the squirrels getting in???
Congratulations to Mick on his grand future! Great parents who have obviously taught him all he needs & he’ll figure the rest out! Your property looks great considering the natural wear & tear. Those rodents are a problem everywhere. Moosey is in his happy place as long as he’s with you! Blessings for a great summer & to all 🤗💗🇨🇦
Congratulations on the land to your son!!! Your videos are so calming!
Where's Massey at?
Congrats on being betrothed 25 years this year~ John & I celebrated 29 years a few weeks ago - Love watching video of your grown son starting out on his own in Alaska! Love it! Alaska is on our bucket list
now will dave help him with the pump well for water. I didn't know he was ur son and subscribed before I watched this video.
Brooke, would your local fire department be interested in using the bunker as a practice building?  They could haul off the debris afterward.
Love your family's content.
This was one of the best videos ever. Wow. Thank you for sharing this experience.  What a cool young man... 'thank you for the guiding'...  I just lost it.  Lol. He'll figure it out just like yall did. He has the best of you both in him.  Glad you're back on the land. 💚
How old is Micky ?
Empty nesting is hard for the first year. Lots of emotions similar to the grief cycle. Big hugs
Brooke, I live in a house that is half concrete. It holds the heat or the coolness. You could make it a rental Airbnb? How long will you be staying in AK? til fall? My son too, relocated to AK when he was around 20 yrs old and has not looked back to returning to the east coast. He is 50 yrs old now.
I subscribed to your son's channel not knowing who he was.
Looks like your son already knows what he wants to do and I have to say he's property looks awesome lm sure he will do great I wish him the best of luck 😊
Thanks for sharing the journey with us. You know it's part of your private life but it's definitely pivotal moment in time. The scenery you show this was incredible. So  breathtaking. I think that y'all done great with your children it's time for them to explore the world. I love that you camper made it I really do love it it's quite beautiful. One of my closest friends passed away last December right after you build this and I wanted her to see it because she wanted something like this. We would call it a gypsy wagon. So, I like to see it every Now and then. She had a free spirit like yours. ❤❤. Happy trails to the both of you. ❤❤
wow I must not pay attention!  I had seen his channel in the past few weeks and sub'd thinking this is going to be fun watching a youg kid starting out hsd adult life this way!   Now knowing his parents are there is no doubt he has retained a lot of the knowledge but like the 2 of you being differemt in your styles I can alreafy see the parts of each of you in his personality.
It's great you were able to pull over on that looong trip and know you had a nice bed to sleep in. Did you figure out how the squirrels got in the cabin?
Wow !!  Alot happening in this video .. Mickey has his vision and has been taught strong work ethics to make his own start ,, I imagine he will have to find a job to fund his dream ,, as we all did .. Great looking piece of property to work with ,, looks private yet outlying views and what appeared to be an access road already there ..  Wish him the best ..      ..Agree the condition of a vacant property on arrival can be a surprise  ... Having an extra mobile shelter can be a blessing ,,  don't remember but could do a simple camper setup in the Blueberry van could also be usefull considering the various sites you have ...Moose having the time of his life chasing the squirrels ,, fun to watch .. Cleanup of the bunker was necessary but with all you have going on ,, I would just let it be ..   Stay Safe and God Bless ..
What happened to Masey
How did the squirrels get into the cabin?
Beautiful country
Sorry to put this on here but I finally got to see you in Mongolia and was so disappointed that they barely showed you until right before you tapped out!!✌🐢
Mickey congrats on your beautiful property!! Trees look like aspen which will be beautiful yellow in the fall and also you have a ton of pine trees which will be nice greenry in the winter...and the view AMAZING!!! Best of luck building your home & establishing your life in Alaska!! 💪🏔🦬🦬🦬
I would put a sturdy roof and doors on the survival bunker and use it for storage. I enjoy watching your son's channel. You both did a great job raising your kids
Great way to end my weekend, first a video from Dave and then 1 from Brooke. You guys are great.
Glad you made it safely. Already watched Dave’s video and Mickey’s. He sure wants to do it himself. 😂 can’t wait to see what you decide to do with this place. Love it!
How do those rodents get in?   What is the protocol in finding out the laws in building these on private land?
What an amazing family. I assume you guys have all read SteinBeck's "Travels with Charlie?"  I told Dave about a kickass 25 Watt GMRS radio  that might punch through the timber better when it's raining or snowing.  200 bucks a pair . 35 bucks for the whole family, for 10 years.  No test, it's not a Ham.  You could use the more portable  Midlands when you're closer together . I assume mick has already gotten 2300 marriage proposals, so you'll need four.
When growing up we would go to our uncle's cabin on Silvan Lake in Indiana. We had cleaning to do before fishing.
Turn the cement bunker into a summer greenhouse. Clear top.
Moose looks like an adult  Corky, with long hair with  black & brown & white hair! He'so wonderfull!!! Always looking for what He can find! I love to watch him, for the few minutes he is on screen! Love the way you both support your son and are Willing to give him his space!!!
Just Enjoy have Fun Adventures Awaits
How did Mick find the property?
What to do with the Bunker?  That decision depends on what you want to do with the property.    If you are going to flip it, yes, I would make the most of the structure.   I suggest  a Hunting Cabin or a Trapper's Cabin.    Definitely get it dryed in: roof and better doors.  I would work with the Roof structure to provide plenty of hanging storage, since space is minimal on the ground and walls.   I still think you should drop a couple of matches on that floor, and have a couple of fire extinguishers on hand to put the fire out.  If you can still smell it, it's still flammable... mostly.   If you can get down to a slab, I have a concoction that should get rid of the smell.  I found it in Popular Science, and it's a recipe a Chemical Engineer used to get smells out of his clothes.  1 quart of hydrogen peroxide, 1/4 cup of baking soda and 1-2 tablespoons of liquid dish soap.  That works on skunk spray, too.  Saturate the surface, then flush with clear water. I would be tempted to get a 'real' floor down, but I'm not sure if there is a slab under that dirt.  In the windows, you might could cut the thin strips out to provide more light into the space, or just make that suggestion to the buyer.     All and all, It depends on what your plans are for the property.    If you keep it, heavy sigh, I get it.  How can you waste those strong walls?  They look like they'd survive a tornado, or a bear!  Getting a roof on it and well fitting doors... might cost more than the structure is worth.  Why put that much money and effort into a shed?  With the fuel smell, you can't use it as food storage, which would be perfect for that structure.  It would be like a root cellar.  Whatever you decide, I look forward to seeing you make it work.
you two  done a great job with him ..he'll be ok hug ! :)
When your son said "Thanks for all the guidance"...that literally made me tear up. That was a beautiful statement for your son to say to you both. 💙   So seeing Moose so happy in your vids always warms my heart. What a wonderful loving dog you have and how blessed is Moose to have two wonderful parents & family. 💙🐾🦴🏔
The Alaska highway is rough on everything except a tank.
One trip and it needs a maintenance checklist.  I feel so bad..... seeing those little tiny pinners holding that old speaker cleat in I can't...... no..... I cry......
I know it must be so hard to Not give advice to your children. I have really backed off from that too. I just figured that I've been around a time or two and I must have learned something. But young people don't really ask their parents much anymore. But they Will say, what they learned from atotal stranger. Really!   Good trip with Dave must have been nice for you. See you on your next visit.
Heartfelt❤️🌅✨
Happy Anniversary early ❤🎉
YES, I'M W/ YOU BROOKE, ON NOT A GOOD FEELING W/THAT CEMENT BUNKER!!!! LIKE YOU SAID, "MAYBE A STOREAGE SHED, SOME DAY???  Do take care. Fl.
Did the chimney being torn off blow ash from the stove into the house? Just a thought? Great video, thank you
Alaska has to be the most beautiful country in the world.  You and Dave have done a lovely job with your kids, you should be very proud of yourselves.
You can use the bunker for a lockup. Anything you wish to leave on the land that if people come across anything they aren't apt to destroy it or steal it. Also you can keep things in there that wont get damaged from weather over winter or if your gone for months at a time. Keep tents or what ever you like.
Where is your other dog? I haven't been around for awhile but very glad to be back..
Thank you for taking us with you on your way back home. I watch Mickey's channel. Ya'll have great vision on land.  I love your reaction when you saw his land.  I've seen Dave's video of his trip to Alaska.  It's so much beauty on your trip. As for the concrete shed.  It's cleaned and you will see what you would do.  I'm with you on that one.  Maybe in 10 years you'll do something with it..or leave it like it is.
I remember driving away leaving my Daughter at the university. Moments like that stay for ever in your memories. Moose either needs some longer legs or a BB gun. Well on second thought maybe not a BB gun. I know your proud of your Son, you've done a great job.
O, yeah. And what about bears? I think I've only seen you have to deal with that one interrupting your women's training camp. I think I may be watching the wrong videos about bears. Lol
What a nice cabin!!
Omg, that vardo is freaking beautiful Brooke. So YOU! Glad you had a fun and safe trip, well wishes to your son, you, Dave, and the whole fam! :)
That’s a sweet Jeep truck. Love to see some videos with that on the @bushradical channel!
New to your channel.  Saw you on Josh's live from @Southern Roots an Alaska Branches.
Blinking heck Brooke.. I was blubbering my eyes out when you said bye 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 flipping heck,you delivered Mike safely into the world in Alaska & you delivered him back safely now .. gosh why do they have to grow! Bless you both.
I have never been to Alaska, looks beautiful from your video..
Maybe the old shelter could just be a shed.
Moose approves !!!!!
Really enjoyed this. Help Moose get a squirrel! Thank you for letting us know about Mickeys channel. You got a great young man there. I'm gonna enjoy watching him create his home. Thank you so much for the great pleasure you give me watching you and Dave and now Mickey. I'm old as dirt but I learn something every time.
I see that concrete box as a base for building on top of. The concrete area is perfect for under house parking of quad bikes etc and above could be a cute cabin up in the trees..you may just get a nice view. Rent it out maybe..great to see all the rubbish cleared away btw :)
Concrete building would make a decent workshop
HELLO Brooke &. Dave 🤗 so nice you took the trip with Mick & sure tore at your emotions 🥺 the Vardo is so comfy & pretty & glad made the trip alright 👍 love your cabin 😉 I remember when you started cleaning out the cement structure ( what a mess) 🥴 enjoy your tine in alaska & be safe 🙏🥰
Aw man…I felt your pain leaving your boy 😩 Yall sure did raise a wonderful guy!! So competent, independent AND intelligent!! I just love all of you 🥰 I can’t believe you saved those peanuts 😆
What about a shed? Workshop? Fancy chicken coop?  Not human habitable but certainly cozy for a couple goats?
you don't live there there moving in hug :)
What an adventure!!❤
On that bunker ,i would make a garage out of it or storage shed. Really enjoyed ur video.
The Bunker could be a good first floor for a two story cabin.
Your son has a great piece of property. Know your proud. Long trip for you but beautiful. Thanks for taking us along.
Awesome family!  God bless you guys.🙏💙
we'r seriously happy living in times where u did not have to light  up a fart in order to satisfy a pool of  followers.
Suggestions for cinderblock structure" Workshop -  bodega - classroom - smokehouse - storage - art studio - observatory - stock pin.
After 45 years of driving truck,  6  years of it hauling gas, diesel,  fuel oil, and jet fuel, I can't stand the smell of any of these fuels! That being said,  I had an old timer tell me to always carry apple vinegar in a spray bottle (full strength) to wash my hands and spray on spills on my clothes to get rid of the smell before I got back into the truck. Believe me, it works!
I'm so excited to see where Mick takes this new adventure as he has great role models. Did Daisey stay back with Belle?
Tough trip!  You will get it cleaned up.
You did a good job with Mickie!
Would plastic storage containers work for better storage of food or would it get moldy that way? How did they get in? Amazed how well it stood on its own through storms, the pesky critters are always creative at finding little tiny holes and contorting themselves to squeeze in and gnaw to make it bigger, so sorry. Love your experiences and travels and your shows, very well done again, thank you.
wow :)
Maybe you can make that building into a food storage
Perfect way with nature
Your son is so cute and he definitely has your sense of humor. Great job on the camper. Lovely views, specially that mountain Lake. I'm drooling.
Id knock out the windows in that bunker and fill them in and the back door, build the front wall up 4 foot or so and put a sloped roof on and use it as a secure storage shed
Is your cabin far from Mick's property?
the cement building, I'd store firewood in it and outside of it too because i'd build a huge deck on top of the cement building and have a nice overhang to keep the snow off the outside fire wood which is pulling double duty of hiding the ugly cement.. might want to paint it first to a more cheerful color though. it doesn't have to be a nice viewing platform/deck, it could also be a  mock tree house with wrap around porch. you did mentioning something about buying someone else's failed dreams once.. i think.... well.. build upon them and make them even better.
Exciting times for your son and his new property.  Your vardo looks great and it's obvious its extra special, you put a lot of hard work into it. I keep imagining it to be a tent house bunker lol
Hey Brooke I just subscribed to your son. Great video. That concrete building would be great for storage. 😊
Have to do the bunker girl in the woods. We all know ur gonna. Lol. That building is extraordinarily cool.
Glad you all got to your destinations safely. I remember when my son, 20, moved from NJ to Michigan. Bawled my eyes out. He’s 44 now & in Tampa🤷‍♀️. The Vardo got a little bit of road sandblasting. Yikes. Sorry about the squirrels. It crossed my mind that maybe there was a minor earthquake in the area & it loosened a bit of wood dust. Love you guys!!❤️❤️❤️
Steel cans to store stuff in now on
I had to smile, your home built trailer held up on those roads better than most new factory built RVs... Enjoy the summer!
Great parenting! Adventurist mom and dad launch their son on his own Alaskan adventure!🥰👍
Snow and the winds were bag this winter
Have just subscribed to your son's channel x
are those space worms on the side?
Beautiful scenery! Weather and critter damage is always a bummer, but a small price to pay when you live remote on such a beautiful piece of property. Enjoy! I can't wait to see the adventures you take us on. You need to christen that bunker the tightly whitey resort! 😂 The perfect Airbnb! A great investment opportunity! Of course I'm joking. 🤪
When he said “Thanks for all the guiding” I cried. 😢❤ great job raising him!!
You can turn it into a tiny Alaskan prison and rent it out to the government 😂
hi brooke. love your show . you and dave are awesome and now i get to follow your son. he is definitely a combination of you both.  i really look forward to sitting down and sharing your adventures. take care and thanks.
I had wondered why we saw you daughter out fishing with mom. Empty nest syndrome is beginning to set in...          I bought an 18 volt cordless pruner at home depot. It is a game changer for small limbs and underbrush. (Particularly when you reach my age and are starting to get a little arthritis...)
Good evening from Texas...wish I was in Alaska eating ice cream; its triple digits here! Yuk! So proud for your son!💗
The snow sliding off the roof took your stove pipe with it.  This is why I put my stove pipe on a gable end side. You can build a cricket above the metal roof so the snow will split around the pipe if you want to put it back up again. This summer here in Vermont the deer ticks are out in force as our property has lots of deer and bear that scatter them around. As for the bunker, you might be better off to build a second story over it and use the cement room for storage or a root cellar. This would be perfect for winter storage and Dave's motorcycle.
I’ve been following Mick from the first video. Exciting to see him clearing his land and to see what the future holds for him!! I’ve been following you and Dave for a couple of years now!! Always love your videos!!
Ash from the fire place piping
Glad you made it up there safely. Your son looks so young, but when he spoke, he sounds a lika man. Pretty shocking how quickly they grow up. Yep, it's tough when they fly the nest and they get to make their own decisions, just as you did, only stepping in when asked. That has been a challenge for me. But I think I've finally found the path. Now I get the enjoy my grandchildren and again, bite my tongue to keep unsolicited advice from passing out of my mouth.  The bunker looks like some sort of awful prison cell. Don't like it, no I don't. But perhaps a place to park the bike, store stuff or wood in the future.  Take care, God bless and stay happy.
You could turn the old shelter into a storage barn. 🤔
Girl you and your husband Dave always never sense to amaze me! Where did you get those shades. Paper shades?
Hi 👋🐾  I still think I’d take, maybe three days and a sledge hammer and take down the bunker. It’s just creepy. And doesn’t have the let’s live in the woods vibe.   With regard to your son, I’m sure he will be just fine. I wish I could have had parents like you guys.   Anyway, as always, thanks for the great videos. They are always cool, educational and entertaining.
I'd put a metal roof on it to be a storage shed for securing your tools for when you decide what to build there!
The gypsy wagon ‼ Oh yea.  Nice. Thanks so much for sharing your adventure.  from New Hampshire.  I think the word is:   Inspirational.   Wow.  Just imagine.   ✨🌸✨
If it doesn't bring you joy, let it go. That bunker isn't what you want at all. There is a spot that speaks to you.  The cabin that had the tree on the roof, maybe?
The camper is super awesome that ceiling looks like it would be hard to build. 😊
So good to see this property again I had forgotten about that crazy concrete building. I agree with you leave it alone and do some thing else that is much more rewarding and suits your lifestyle. I’m so glad the Bardo made it I knew it would and just keep it maintained and it will last you a very long time.❤❤
If squirrels got in there has to be a hole or holes somewhere. Time to find and repair them.
If you guys don't want that bunker, then I can take it and fix it up to live in for a few years at least and once I leave it then you can have it back for a guest cabin
It’ll make a good storage shed someday!  I miss Maisie, but I know your old gal can’t weather such long distance travel.  Moosie sure does a great job replacing her.   I love watching all of your channels!  Congratulations on raising such a fine young man and becoming “empty nesters”!  Blessings beautiful family ❤️
Where's Da Woof ?
we have same probs with our caravan i keep everything in totes on floor when travelling
Hi Brooke! What a great video! First time seeing your son 🤗😊  He will enjoy building on that beautiful property! Moose is Soooo cute! Where is Maisy?
You are such sweet nice people. I remember when my son went on his first Navy deployment. I was so scared for him. Your kid will do well also, because he has awesome and supportive parents. Peace to you.
da Woof?
Bison .. baby's .. are called red dogs
Awesome video Brook !! I watched the build but it just hit me watching it go down the road it looks like a gisphy wagon , like the one used in the tv. Series circus boy with Mickey Dolenz , back in the late 50s early 60s , anyway good video young lady THANK YOU FRANK FROM MONTANA.......
Congrats on 25 years 🎊🎉
Where’s da woof?
outdoor gallery - use the space for your creativity.  good luck to your son
It was sweet to hear you'll be 25 years married.  I got married in January of 1976 and if I could do my life over I'd still want to marry the very same girl.
Hi Brooke!  Clicked so fast!  I bet you are super proud of your son. 🥰🥰
very nice
I loved that you had the vardo for sleeping on the trip.   And I love Mickey's land and the view.   I am watching his channel also.
Enjoy your video's. Thanks for the great ideas:) Cheers
It is hard  saying goodbye to your child even though that is what you want…. them to be on their own.   But a mom!!!!❤
Put a roof and doors on it. Decide later what to do with it.
Make the bunker into a garage to keep tools, log splitter and such.
Bush Radical & Girl in the woods on a Sunday. Now that's my kind of viewing & learning.
You 2 are active and busy enough that the "empty nest syndrome" won't hit quite as hard as some less active people, but it will still be felt.  Best wishes to Mickey on his new life
You and Dave did such an awesome job raising Micky. I follow him on his channel and I find him interesting and hard-working. Nice to see in this mixed up world.
Oh! Happy anniversary
You are the best parents ever to have raised your son to be independent. I follow his channel and I know in my heart that he will do great!! 😊 . I think that the two of you are super awesome!!  You work together as a married couple should. You support one another and you love the Lord ❤. You both have shown and taught this to your children to be self reliant and have a love ❤️ for the wilderness and for that I am so thankful!!  Much love and many blessings for y’all and your family!!  🥰
Wow, that's the first time I ever saw your son. Wow bison. I've never seen them up close and personal like that. This is got to be the trip of a life time.  I love your videos. It's like I'm there with you. Thanks for sharing your adventures, Brooke!
☺️💕
Where’s Maisy?!?
A lot cleaner
What a wonderful, capable and, I have to say, a cutie patootie son you two have.  I'm following his channel and, of course, his parents channels as well. The filming, the scenery, the skill sets are all inspiring for this retired 68 yo RN living on 10 acres in Northern California with my own projects. I'm loving and learning from all of the videos.  Have a wonderful time in AK!! BTW, Moose is a hoot and a great companion.
I’m there with y’all.  My daughter has been on her own for a while.  You’re right it’s hard not to give unasked advice.  Then again, it’s fun to watch kids learn and evolve.  Have fun
Wind blowing into the fireplace, maybe? The bunker would be a good shed.
You're great parents 😂❤ i know that's maddening to let him fly lol.
What happened to your other beautiful dog?
Love all your videos ❤😊and thanks for turning me on to Homestead rescue I’ve been binge watching them since I saw your video.
I think your son will do fine. Both u an Dave raised him right.
The animals came in through the hole where the chimney was and had a party in your cabin.
May I ask you a question I watch your your YouTube channel and your husband's YouTube channel I was just wondering what happened to the other dog
I know he'll do good! He learned from the best parents!!!!
I'm sure he thanks you for not being doting parents. He gets to learn this life. What an adventure he's in for!
I have watched his videos, can’t wait to see what he does with his property, he had good teachers, you guys are the best 😊
I like seeing your son in the videos. You got married the same year I was born
Omg! I subscribed to your son not knowing he’s your son! How awesome is that? I saw his videos in my feed! I thought this young man is going to be awesome! 😂🙌🏻🥰💞😁👋🏼☺️
Foil for your shades..one and 👍🏼 done😀
He has a lot of hard work ahead of him but when he's finished his place will be priceless.
How much does your trailer weigh?
Your carpentry and artistry proved with that long slog up North to Alaska!  Brava!  Well-done.  Mostly cosmetic and slight.   I'm sure your loving hubby is happy and proud of your efforts (with his help at times but that is proper).  Glad you journeyed with your Son.  Hope he's happy and succeeds.  Thanks for sharing all the joy!  That Survival Bunker could be used as a Walled Garden with raised beds filled with compost - would keep the deer/elk/rabbits out if you put doors on.  Even could net the roof to keep birdies off the veggies. Could raise things that are perennials and quick grow veggies?
Happy Anniversary
Dang!  I wasn't expecting the son to have such a deep voice!!!   Totally doesn't fit his baby face!
Like your video and 🐕☺️
You and Dave are amazing people.
Outstanding adventures
Baba booey baba booey
That’s a hard one all you can do is hope he learned enough from you about life , he will do great
I want to build one of these SO SO bad! Brooke, you’re amazing!
Glad you all went together
Love your videos. Can't wait for the notification. Wishing your son all the best on his new adventure.
Good evening from Syracuse NY USA everyone
...GOTTA LOVE A GREAT ROAD TRIP, KEEP SAFE AND WELL...
