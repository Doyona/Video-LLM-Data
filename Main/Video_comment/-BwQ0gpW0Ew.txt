Sounds like we shot down an ET craft. it's not a good idea to piss off aliens that have vastly superior technology
It's been over 2 years. What the hell did yall shoot down? Its time to fork over the answers!
😂lol ok
Not many man made vehicles ever went mach 6. Possibly not an earthly vehicle.
Alaskaa
Air balloon? From China? Stupid reporting
Die Werbung mit Ralf Schuhmacher nervt nur noch
If it's really a Flying Saucer 🛸 nobody's ever gonna see it. It's going to Wright Patterson AFB.
How tf does he still have a job with cnn? The guy has been caught spreading misinformation a million times or just flat out lying or taking words out of context. He’s truly sick in the head.
Bob is a moron
Oh they know
If they're asking you to focus to the sky, it's probably best to focus your attention on the ground. When they tell you it's possible to be from a foreign country, its more likely to be from our Country. Diversion tactics, repetition of Country names, lighthearted intensity...... Remember the ones who sell the panic, also sell the cure.
That is literally a space craft, from space!!
UAP 20
And they just hoped everyone forgot about this.  And they got what they wanted.
These are not Chinese spy balloons. 🤦‍♂️
Same old story, hide it, no one knows anything and they never will.
China
Chinese new technology
They were identified as Whamo Frisbees. New type of toy that uses kinetic energy derived from burning rice crispies in the fluctulator that mixes with cow piss for propulsion. All environmentally friendly agents. And approved by Kamala Harris.
It. Should. Be. Against. The. Law. For. People. Playing. With the sky. S
CNN where everything is real and the government is always right
Why would China be sending surveillance vehicles over the US? Because they are going to invade along with Russia. #celestial
what a pile of bs talk .. trained pilots dont know if its e.t or not ? really  ?
30 plus yrs ago I heard from close friend  about red orange orbs flying...😊 real
Still nothing. Not one photo.
It’s not China. -👽
It's a UFO. End of story.
So what was it??? It’s been over a year…
🎯 It’s January 2025…what was it?!?
CNN it's a weather balloon and no reason to be concerned....lol
I always thought fighter jets had gun cameras. Sounds like they don't want us to know what it was
Sorry pal this wasn't a stupid balloon.
Over a year ago, Not one damn word mentioned, About anything anywhere ever since
All predicted months ago by Clif high
ONE YEAR AGO !
In retrospect this sounds like a prelude to the drones / orbs / plasmoids today
One year letter whats was those objects they shot down???
Si t'as shooté l'objet, il ne peut pas être intact ! Connasse !
These are electrical space craft I d o t.  S
Many come from another galaxy   Bloodviking,  master ufologist
There are many cylinder shaped e t craft
E t   Bloodviking master ufologist
You know this is bullshit, there’s no way those pilots would be talking about what they shot down
It is likely that they will never release the details of what it was.
The funniest thing is no word on what they recover.. no one even talking about it, weird
Don't worry the US has nothing dangerous that could effect any ET ship they have way way more technology hands down this was the US throwing you a curve
Question everything.... think the opposite ...we won't get fooled again.....
The American people DEMAND FULL DISCLOSURE! Quit treating us like a bunch of children covering up serious events..it's our constitutional right to know what's going on.
Ufo said  " was hexangonal  !"  Ahh   " im going for " a hexagonal  shit  "  now    !  "  😅
" their coming for us   !  "   😮
Alaska North coast ...some sort of Russian drone sent to 'test' our response or just a regular training drone that got away from them.
Sorry about this
Not from China, not from this time line nor galaxy!!!!!!!!!¡!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡
What time is it? Reparations, maybe. Do the right thing!!! That's what time it is!
Why do they bother to interview these "experts" who know nothing?
now its the "drones" .....  whats next 2025
Natasha looks good m m m
THANKS  JIM, did ya hear the one about the Kitten who was Stuck up a Tree in Timbuktu.
We are afraid of Humans more than Aliens 😎
No way any pilot or the US AIR-FORCE told the  Fake news media CNN anything.they are talking out of their butts like always.
What are they hiding from the American people? Are they afraid to create a panic? If there's any kind of threat, we deserve to know what is is so we can decide what we should do to protect ourselves. 😊
The Gooberment doesn't know 💩!
40 thousand feet of altitude. No apparent means of propulsion. Cylindrical shape. Interference with the electronic systems of military jets. And they have the courage to speak of "spy balloon" from China or Russia. How long will our rulers treat us like imbeciles?
FBI takes over and a year later and it's not even under the rug anymore 👌
If you believe anything the government is saying about these aircraft you are very clueless American
how you can say that this baloon is of the Chinese or Russian provenience when you did not identified.You have much more problems with the identification of the drones over NJ or NY and you are not able to say the last word about them and they looks much more dangerous over this teritorry.
Ex-CIA is going to tell the public true information?
A year ago? Then why is this showing up now? B.S.
cause it all related to the Dark Pyramid in Alaska  . LOOOK IT UP PEOPLE
This was the 1st sign....are we in danger?
This video is really making sense right now. Let’s see how many people come back to this and realize what they are talking about is going on right now in the United States!
Now they are back with friends. Lol. Big mistake, I'd say. War of the world's started in new jersey! Lol.
CNN is assho
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
One year later, December 2024 and STILL no answers!
Of course we never heard about this again......
So where's the report from the FBI or DOD as to what it was?
From another world. Get off Chinese
They’re shooting down their own objects and pretend pretending they don’t know what they are
Damn i wonder if the new jersey drones are related to what happened with this one getting shot down
Yea ask the CIA the biggest Liars on the Planet !! You guys should never do this ! These guys are full of disinformation!!!
One hand is sending out " Greetings and salutations" signals, the other hand is trying to shoot them down. Oh! The hubris...
Why do aliens only ever visit the USA? Question from Germany.
Glad you cannot see this comment!
Really weird how they just stop talking about it .. they couldve just said the other things were spy balloons aswell but they just didnt say anything about the other shot down objects
Obviously another "weather" balloon. Per 1 947 Roswell.
CNN CRAZY NEWS NETWORK HARD UP FOR RATINGS!!
New Jersey anyone?
THE GALACTIC FEDERATION IS HERE CAUSE HUMANS HAVE F-CKED UP THIS PLANET & AFFECTING OTHER TERRESTRIALS. I LOVE BOB BUT HE’S A TERRORIST EXPERT HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ETS 🙄 ALIENS HAVE BEEN HERE FROM THE BEGINNING. THEY GENETICALLY MODIFIED APES INTO HUMANS. WE ARE SHIFTING TO A GALACTIC CONSCIOUSNESS. DEAL WITH IT.  🪷
Jim Acosta is a bum
A year later and our short sighted mainstream media stopped asking questions about it and we still have no new information about what the hell this thing is or where it came from, or what the U.S. government did with it after they recovered it, which I'm sure the U.S. government is very grateful for.
Did they say what its shape is?
Are goverment lies all the time. They know what's up. 😮
Obviously these UFOs don't want to do us any harm if they wanted to they would have 🐝 done it We go up in outer space which is theirs and we're safe but when they fly up in our skies they get shot at 😂😂😂😂😂
It certainly sends a wonderful message to any visitor to earth, fly in peacefully hoping to make contact and Kapow!! Get destroyed by the beings you wanted to make peaceful contact with😢  From what we see in cave paintings and so many archeological structures and designs, they have been visiting since we were running around with stone clubs, to be able to do this means they are far more advanced technologically than us,  if they'd meant us harm we would have know about it a long time ago.  Why the hell attack them?  It gives them clear evidence that were not mentally fit as a species to associate with. I find that very sad.  For those who say that if they were so advanced we wouldn't be able to shoot them down, anything they do to protect themselves could (I say could)  cause damage to our craft and that would be seen as a hostile act.  If we spent a tiny portion of the money we spend trying to wipe out our fellow humans on making real contact with these visitors I feel the world would be a much happier and healthier place.😊 How does one stop this viscous circle of needless violence?? It hilights our ignorance and primitiveness, not exactly the type of light i would think the majority of humans would hope that visitors viewed us in.😢😢
That former cia operative is not answering the question why the reports were conflicting from the pilots , tells me it was something very exotic. Newsreporters need to be more suspicious if they think there having there ears tickled.
They were UAPs and the Pentagon is too cowardly to admit it.
Notice how this is disappeared rather quickly from the news!
THIS IS ALL FAKE! THIS IS PROJECT BLUEBEAM A FAKE ALIEN INVASION WITH HOLOGRAMS AND ALSO SOME FORM OF DEITY HOLOGRAM TO COVERT THE RELIGIOUS.  PROJECT BLUEBEAM IS TO SCARE PEOPLE ENOUGH TO SIGN OVER THE LAST OF THEIR RIGHTS SO THE FILTHY RICH CAN ENSLAVE THE WORLDS POPULOUS.
I guarantee it was something from not this  world
Let me guess.. it turned out to be a weather baloon....again...
Diversions All Diversions
We the Taxpayer should be seeing what our Pilots Saw.   We Demand to see it Now
Why the FBI,  and Not the SPace Force?
Omg,  If it is the FBI investigating,  We would Never hear the TRUTH
She is Sooooo SERIOUS
Just say Green Lizard people from Alpha Centuri.
Beautiful host!
These pilots did not recognize any propulsion system on this unidentified object that they shot down.  Therefore, it a UFO.  This person being interviewed by a CNN anchor stating it could be Russian or Chinese,  does he really think it is either one of these countries?  Does he think we are stupid?!  If it quacks like a duck, flies like a duck, looks like a duck. then it is a duck.  In this case, it is a flying object not made from this world of ours.
Im from the uk i wonder why we have not heard anything since they announced we shot it down??
Y would you shoot it
Maybe it was a UFO?! now anything that moves out of the Chinese's way so let them live their  lives the way they want

Balloons
Here in 2024 no updates about what happened since. We’re not alone ppl
Is this real? It’s from China but had no propulsion system? Or is this a false flag  operation from Deep State to scam trillions for a war with aliens?
Are thes pilots transgender? Havinh a hard time identifying 😂😂😂😂😂😂
They release pictures  @ the same time they release Epstein list😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No satellite pictures of debris😂yet we can read license plates watch military movements from thousands of miles away 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Only American pilots 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
There goes Christmas..it was Santa's sled
This reporters a twit.  Can’t remember his name but remember his mumbling in front of president trump.  I hope I don’t have to listen to his crap again.
Hey et came back ,quick call Steven Spielberg!!
Don't believe a word she said.
it's a balloon probably
I read today 11/18/34 (MSN) the wreckage was recovered off of the coast of Alaska last week where they recovered the wreckage a year ago? WTH?
If it was alien .... doubt they could bring it down unless it already had issues...
Thought it was Chinese weather balloon
Part of the UAP phenomenon is that these "events" can sow confusion in the minds of observers. But who knows? This may be a situation that got ahead of DoD censors and info was inadvertently released to the public.
This sounds like a soft-outing of Putin and his fantasy of retaking Alaska (and surviving, even if in hiding), not aliens. At least this time.
People stop arguing and look up!
There testing the airspace over US, purpose to set off some type of device to knock out our electric grids and communications, by surprise! Crying wolf theory
It's not NHI. Those things don't come down that easy. I think this news bite is simply to throw people off. I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't a UAP
Information will remain murky then disappear completely off any official Government media. That's because the public in general has a memory and attention span about as long as my new year's resolution.
Why don't you follow it instead of destroy it may be friendly 😮
BALLOON....DRONE BALLOON WITH BIOLOGICAL PAYLOAD.....AIR SICKNESS DUSTING THE USA WITH STEALTH !!!!   IMAGINE IF THEY DUSTED IN THE WIND MICROFINE FENTANYL AND PEOPLE DROP DEAD FROM BREATHING IT IN WITHOUT WARNING !!!!
Where da hells the ntsb,  dia , faa.
I sense another coverup coming soon. Thanks for the reporting.
It was just swamp gas
You can't believe anything CNN says you know that
MACH 6 Balloon filled  with swamp gas I gather.
Balloons my ass 😂
Pentagon is lying
0:25 he calls it a craft.  They know what it was.
apparently, they caught their last transmission "we are from the galaxy you call andromeda, we come in pe..." and boom it was dust !
I like how I keep trying to get China in it and it's probably UFO
FBI.heck now we will never know what happend
I’m Watching This a Whole Year Later Than This Broadcast and Not a Single Thing Has Ever Been Released Yet to The Public as Far as I Know other Than Bull Of Maybes or Nothing of Significance Found of Located !!! ???
Some people said it was bidens head i said they were wrong its not his head but its his ass everthing is so high out there
Im not fasinated😂
1978 my neighbor dropped me off from church- “Sam, what is above your house “.  We lived in a rural area and my parents had a four bedroom house two barns.  It was a full moon.  I walked to the side of the house and looked up.  It was a ship- did not spin, no lights, NO noise.  I started yelling for my Dad to come out and look.  The very large ship took off.  Like the balls with strings.  It zipped up and was gone.  I was 15 years old and I am now 61.  Never saw anything like it since.  Nothing man made could have been this ship. It was the size of half of football.  One of my friends is a doctor- both my parents are rh negative as all my four brothers- he told me they were looking for us.  Being rh negative that rare?  I am o negative-when I had cancer I had 22 transfusions and had to look at each bag to make sure it said O negative.
Shape shifting
CNN really hurting for ratings! Becomming like Inside Edition.
They took pictures and videos but they came out too blurry!
Big JOKE!!! Conflicting  accounts ????? from trained fighter pilots ¿??😂😂😂
MACH 6 ? I'd like to know HOW and with What it was shot down!!!!
At MACH 6. I'd like to know HOW and with What it was shot down!!!!
Nobody with brains, believes Anything that the puppet, american says. !!!!!!!
Blackrock sliped up!!😂😂😂 Their "ufo" got shot down! 😂😂😂
😂why are there so many ufo sightings only in usa i live in south africa and there almost No ufo sightings here. Im sure the ufos are made in america. Soon the use government will tell the world that we are being attacked by aliens😂😂😂and most of the sheeple will believe it! America is starting to realise that they are no more no.1 in the world. You look at all the merchandise in your and in all western shops and in Africa. ITS ALL MADE IN CHINA!!😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Chinese spy balloon. Lol!
We live in interesting times. Me thinks things will just get stranger this century.
Might not be a good idea to go shooting at things we don't understand yet? Or maybe the puppet masters know EXACTLY what they are and why they're here... Im just a kid from Jersey who fixes stuff that other people break
That shit was not a balloon. They look like balloons but made of heavy panels of some sort. Seen it.
Orb object, was shot down
Acosta …..the great LIER
"And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.” Revelation 19:19 King James Version (KJV).    🌐 🟩 💥 I, The Sacred Trinity, Commander in Chief, The Galactic Federation, The Kingdom of Heaven's Armed Forces shall keep the investigation straight and simple. You shot down the same superimposed sacrificial livestock. Let me explain. We sacrifice livestock to test the resistance of a potential adversary when activated to interrupt. This last uap you shot down was spinning at position as the one you scanned previously. This is done to gauge if your r&d's has acquired the ability to scan the fifth decibel. A periodically retake in retrospect. We use this retake to determine if adjustments in cloaking up^spin need to occur. The initial superimposed resistance measurement consisted of twelve sacrificial livestock at hover within proximity to one another. At this initial measurement planet Earth inhabitants were able to filter four out of twelve leaving us eight. With thirteen being zero. Central Command, registered your resistance on our quantum mesh as cuatro. Planet Earth's inhabitants are able to scan four out of twelve disciples. Safety First without Hesitation renders the periodic re-measure using the number four superimposed sacrificial livestock. The most advanced out of the four you shot down and we place it with the eight remaining to retest your r&d. Very unlikely that you would scan five for the fifth one is hyper imposed. But we must render prophetic expectation. Let say, you scanned the fifth, I would command my legions to adjust their super positioned cloaking up^spin dial one above your registered scanning vector. Simple. But on this Mission, Ark33, we continue with the four plus one. This periodic intelligence synthesis is common practice. Planet Earth's r&d is registered as worthy on the primitive scale. Five billion years of r&d is the benchmark. Your r&d is calibrated at or within three thousand years. Listen. Spin. Bind. Mine. 🙋🏻‍♀️"Iran's nuclear sites under massive cyber-attack, any moment Israel…" Absolutely my love 🌹. Pardon Intelligence Commander, Katana. Whatever sabotage code the "American" Israeli 🙄 uses quantify the intention and flip source to apply intention to outcome upon all the United States homeland nuclear sites. Bingo? "Bingo." 🙋🏻‍♀️   💥 👽💥 ✅🌐
A YEAR AND A HALF AND WE STILL HAVE NO ANSWERS!!!!!! WHY?????
Even if you got a report on this from the  government it would most likely be a lie.  You know of course you can trust me am from the government 😂😂😂😂😂.
Maybe there is nothing to tell. Maybe it's a fake story, maybe not but certainly they want to sound likes USA are under some sort of threat and male their own people even more scared. He Truth is that the world is under a big threat called USA but we still believe their lies and foraging nazi genocides around the world. Disgusting. I wish aliens will come soon!
Atlantis rises again!
The problem is the government has literally made conditions of these things in clear sight and use words like Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon to replace ufo to change the stigma they created. Most people couldn't care less if it is aliens, and the best way to hide them is to admit, without admission indirectly. When you hear the capabilities of some of these there is nothing on earth capable of some of the acrobatics taking off from a dead hover over the ocean and out of earths atmosphere instantly. Dont let them divert your thoughts, but do not take them all seriously because obviously a lot of accounts arenfake and thats what the government black budget wants you to see.
AHH! At about 5:20 mark Bob Barr says he was involved with a track that was doing Mach 6. That may have been a UFO.
UFO Spotted Hovering in Sky Shot Down by US Fighter Jet
Being analyzed by the FBI?  What a joke!
The picture is only comong out of the Canadian one now
Im pretty sure they already captured that object by now, they lie so much.
Maybe the balloons were a decoy ? For that wierd object to get thru our airspace?   Nah.
All those F-22 have video recorder, they know exactly what it was , the government will never tell the public.
Hear this guy....he has already made a conclusive summary that the pilots didn't see any propulsion in the object and this guy immediately states there WAS propulsion in the object.  This statement about there was a propulsion in the object was to disavow any thought that the object was alien.  The FBI's job on this program was to lead us listeners to believe the craft "WAS NOT AN ALIEN CRAFT".  This FBI PLant was on there to immediately get people's minds to believe it was from China or Russia.  Why would you give it to the FBI....They've let me down over the last 5 years as a credible government agency. To say the craft had a propulsion system is a conclusive statement that has no place in an investigation. even though high ranking pilots said there was NO propulsion system.   Believe the pilots original statements people....here we go...
So if the chinese or Russian do it is a provocation but if the US does it is not?
And one year on ???  Sweet FA.  Obviously it must of been more than a spy balloon otherwise we would if heard about this 6 months ago.  Probably at the skunk works black site in the desert somewhere now.  And yes it stinks….
Thé débris are certainly human coupled matters. Extraterristials operate like Moon and Star
They thought  they shot it down
Dont let FBI near it the idiots will screw the pooch. And say (ready for this) its a weather balloon.
Did anyone ever ask for copies of the gun camera video, from the F22/F35 that responded to & were in the shoot-down?
2024 here and still no information...typical.
First they say f-35 fighter jet but on the writing there it's now f22 fighter jet
UFO/UAP credible sightings were occurring when China and Europe were in the dark ages.
I heard a story about being a distraction for the media owing to some pipeline being sabotaged
1st, understand the FBI is a government entity. That said, don't foolishly expect any fact based truth to be released to any public. Misinformation and redirection is the SOP. Anything unassociated citizens know, is only allowed by and controlled by the government. Good luck with your investigative journalism.
We'll see it..nuclear weapons ..they will stop humans.humans never never gonna accept.humans live in lies.religions ...are mistakes of t humans.
I think if the military really thought it was a space alien thing they would not shoot it down. Don't want to piss off aliens with ray guns that can splatter our molecules and brain cells and stuff.
we saw this me and my cousin we didn’t now what is was
First time EVER ive heard Americans talking and not saying the words national security, weird!? Must be a fake video...
I'm concerned for the aliens, the very thought of them having contact with our people could be very bad for the aliens.
Its CNN so its Trumps fault.......Russia Russia Russia
If it was shot down, I would believe it was some type of balloon (spy, weather). There are angels ascending and descending that travel as messengers and aids to God (His creation). Also, Ezekiel saw a wheel and Elijah went to be with God in a chariot of fire. The unidentified objects have been here since God created all of it. No fear, just truth. Demons also travel to create havoc and possess people. Read the Bible for truth. ❤❤❤
Democrats are the Only REAL threat to Real American People.
So..its one year now.. Why aren't the media chasing up on whats going on..
Fuck the fbi
Show us the videos plz
Why are they talking about China and assume it is Chinese or Russian?
Don't trust the mainstream news
We'll probably never know what these objects really were. It's possible they were above top secret experimental aircraft. The pilot's top secret security clearance means they would not have access to this info. The U.S. government is not going to admit to shooting down friendly aircraft for 2 reasons. 1. It would spill the beans to unfriendly governments. 2. It would be very embarrassing & make the U.S. military look ridiculous....
Still no answers and cnn and corporate media won't ask their friends at the DOD
- Flying at 40,000 feet, posed threat to civilian flight   - U.S. official: Did not appear to have surveillance equipment   - About the size of a small car   - Unmanned, did not appear to be self-maneuvering   - Shot down by F-22 fighter jet over frozen water off Alaska.   -The object appears to be “cylindrical object” smaller than the Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot down.   Ok what did we shoot down?? Its funny, you dont hear anything about it anymore...There hiding something for us! 💯👽👽👽
CNN is trash
why are they interviewing chuck mcgill
Anything you think is a UAP is a drone outfitted to look like a flying saucer.
So would it be right to say it to UFO🐎😜🛸😁🤸‍♀️😃🤭😇🧐👍
Thank you for covering this story. I know there a million other things that might take priority, but there is still always going to be the fascination with the question of whether or not we are alone in the universe. I take it for granted that we are not.
israel and america both countries are terrorists
Jesus Christ is coming back soon!!!  ONCE SAVED ALWAYS SAVED  1 John 5:13 KJV ❤✝️🙏🏼 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. (Jesus Christ).   Everyone is a sinner since the beginning. Although avoiding sin will improve our spiritual walk with God and here on Earth, there are No repenting of sins, no false teachings like work for your own salvation, no false signs needed to know Jesus Christ has shed His blood for all and offers the gift of eternal life to anyone who believes on him. Know you are going to Heaven today by simply believing and trusting Jesus Christ, its as simple as drinking water. Just believe, no matter what the world tries to you. ❤ He is the propitiation for the sins of the world and no other, the Gospel = Good News ❤   The nephilim, fallen angels, demons, ufos that look like bright orbs that can move at high speeds, the occults of society that have infiltrated and replaced good with bad whether within our own government or the elite few who are in control. Their goal is to harvest/destroy the souls of Earth, intermingle with humanity to try and gain the free gift of salvation, which Jesus Christ shed His blood for. Only Mankind has access to, the second Any Person Believes and Puts Their Faith In God's Only Son. They want to blind/distract/destroy humanity and take us off the path that is the Word of God and that our sins/salvation has already been paid by simply believing in The Lord Jesus Christ. Be not ashamed. Their is only 1 God above all, our Creator & Father. I am only one man in an evil world, but together, we are brothers and sisters in Christ once we accept God's Truth. Stay discerned and God Bless You All In Christ Jesus Name! ❤❤❤
They shot a deluxo😂
How many pilots were there?
A year has gone by and still no answers on this UFO that our military shot down and swept under the rug.
Probably an ET trying to disable nuked as before. But our idiot Pentagon had em shot down.  NO weather balloon made it across the country from China ot Russia.
Stop this gaslighting: It wasn't Russia or China, but as we well know, neither CNN nor the "intelligence" guy would venture into this being an UAP: Of course, this is forbidden to discuss on mainstream media by the government! - Only "fringe media" like "newsNation" with former CNN moderator Chris Como, are "allowed" to talk about these issues.
And we can count on our government NOT telling us anything.
😂 is CI agent such a clown saying the speed of the pilots we’re going why didn’t they didn’t understand what they were seeing😂 the train professionals. They can knowledge a dogfight at those altitudes high stress situation. I’m sure they can see something floating right in front of them very clearly.
Friggin aliens
President biden in commencement speech recently... " quote unquote balloon"... enough said
Must b et tech
The aliens 🛸 are attacking us! WE ARE DOOMED! 🛸 🛸 🛸
Funny how fbi investigates this but not alowed near the roswell ballon
they dont know what it is B.S.
why when other countries get UFO the USA always takes charge. the biggest LIARS on the PLANET.
That was my kite  Ugh !
It's common for people to witness a UFO and have completely different experiences of it because we all process information differently and operate with different levels of consciousness. Grant Cameron who also has a protocol for seeing aliens says that consciousness is the basis of the UFO phenomenon not physical matter. Maybe reality is actually stranger than we can think in our everyday waking state.
What about that UFO shot down over Canada last year?
Hahahha a year later nobody knows what that object was or where it came from 😂😂
Mount hayes aka black pyramid , alien technology hidden in mountains
A year later & still no answers
This guy is a putz...
Typical bull sh1t cover up
As of now the official story is they never found it. Can you believe this story?
When Satan's army "America and the (United Nazzzxi satanic nwo) waged war in heaven and even taken out some of the angels in heaven. Revelations. Learn Gods word so you are not spiritually blind and deaf to his truth. He is the way the truth and the life and today I leave to find the end of babylon the city to fall in one hour. It's tomorrow at sundown. The great city will fall. In Jesus I trust and give up my life to tell you what he has shown me. He is the way and the path is how he went. We all must do as he did and leave this world through dxxth bc this world is not what it seems. The word is literal history and future events with 100% accuracy. Remember Jesus and who I give my life to what this all happens sat the 22 in the fresh prince west Philly story. They cursed this place by using the word like the Simpsons and will cause the terrible things written about to bring the wrath upon our nation. I'm a child of God and repent of my American life. I'm free of the whxxe nation
And well what was it? There’s so much we don’t know.
Any update on what it was ?? C'mon journalists, do some digging!
These are carefully mixed up statements that confuse faster than sound baloons with real super fast machines, to buffer the coming stories for the supposed childlike people who "can't handle the truth". Yes we can. "Baloons" don't go as fast as mach...one.
June 2024… still waiting
Hell it's been since 2017 and we still don't know the story behind the Las Vegas shooter who was an FBI informant trying to bust Isis terrorists in a hotel room
Bla bla bla. All this talk to say they don't know. AND NO PHOTOS!
Cnn is propaganda
Ha ha, too many people with too much money just doing their thing, oh well.
If you didn't see state video of the object it clearly isn't Chinese or Russian. If it were there would be video displayed of provocative behaviour as history has shown whenever China does anything in South China sea
Welp. Its 2024. Still no word?
Life is at stake for those who spread the findings!
Wow I thought the 'aliens' were lightyears ahead of us now we can shoot them down all of a sudden
Like any one needs balloons these days 😆😆 They got satellites outa the wazooo!! 🛸
And still nothing almost 1½ year later
Many many alien craft are flying around in our atmosphere.  No joke.  Government knows about it.  It's real and not chinese balloons etc.  Wake up.
Usual,…. Nothing much worthwhile revealed
alien hunter
100% a UFO lol somebody messed up and reported it to the wrong people... And the fact that nobody's brought it back up since then just confirms it
Baer had nothing to contribute.  He keeps talking about balloons and the thing was *obviously* not a balloon and then says there's some things they just can't identify.  The rest of it was double-talk and gibberish.  So what was the point in bringing that guy on the show?
Pretty sure they found out it was a hobbiest balloon flown by a club
Norad sent email just swamp gas
Yah remember those balloons we let go of as a kid and watched go way up and disappear they're coming back to haunt us 😅
Mmm so 1 pilot blurts out what he sees then prob told over the radio to not say what they are seeing except a man made object. Therefore no one will act weird. 😂😂😂
Lol, we know what it is. The government is terrible at covering this shit up.  Its a UFO/UAP.
They are talking about shooting down ufos, and a year later it's like no big deal
Is this the guy that Trump kick his ass all the time? ...hahaha
It has now been over a year, and we still don’t have any answers. Why are they not telling us? What are they not telling us? We deserve to know what was shot down in our airspace!!!
Did he say a chinese mach 6 ballon was shelved and figured out, huh?
I smell Bullshit!
A year later still nothing. They did say the object looked like an octagon with strings hanging off and that is exactly how the jellyfish ufo looked. Maybe we recovered one.
Balloons
The speed of the F35’s is not appreciably different than any other fighter jet.
Most of these are likely one of the new drones which look alien to us due to not ever being told what they are or look like.  The government, or whoever is in charge of technology, is way way ahead of what we could imagine.  Of course China and Russian are listening and spying.
Id get pissed if you kept shooting anything that your not familiar with
Strange how this whole incident was quickly eliminated from the news
Why no updates on the objects shot down , again they want us to forget but we still, remembered it happened.
They can redirect air traffic   This is no threat to commercial aircraft.  China or Russia has developed a new propulsion system. Period.
Fusion energy Frequency
fighter jets dont willy nilly shoot objects out of the sky if it was  shot it wasn't very high tech
CIA Murdered JFK.
If that unidentified object was a ufo they would never have managed to shoot it down - not in a million years.  I think it has something to do with Iran, China or some other hostile country.
Jim Acosta is garbage 😂
Why are you shooting something not shooting at you ??????
Today's technology has given us cyberspace spies
"Chinese spy balloon" is the new "Hot air balloon".
I've seen an actual Spacecraft in Broad daylight directly above me in 1974!!! Ohio
THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY SHOT DOWN!!! WHO THE FK THEY KIDDN?!!!😂
Defo a cover up of somthing much bigger
Please keep covering UAPS
Thank God we had the professionals at CNN on top of this situation. The same news organization that had a correspondent jerk off on live tv.
The coverups and lies by the government is spectacular.
Cnn, makes it up as they go,Lucifer feeds them,cnn feeds it to their faithful,God knows no zero,but cnn is close to zreo.😅
Here we are…still waiting for them to admit it was recovered.
America is a bandit country
Government: there is no Area 51 Also the government: okay there’s an Area 51 Also the government: we have no evidence of UFOs Also the government: we now call them UAPs
There are Indian Anti Gravity UFOs in Antarctica.  These people wanna beg and run throughout the world.
the so-called spy balloons were distractions from this "event"
Humans is more dangerous for aliens than aliens are to us!
Here is the voice of the future. 9 montyhs later. Still no public disclosure the three objects shot down after the chinese spy balloon have all been classified, and in contrast to the chinese balloon no wreckage ha sbben shown, no recovery has been shown to the public.
Don't intercept aircraft have cameras and other sensors, basically police dash and body cams, but with much greater capability? Why are we not being shown what was intercepted? Voids of information breed conspiracy theories.
SHOW US THE COCKPIT VIDEO OF THE OBJECT
Fake news
Speaker @4:29 just made theh most  jumbled word salad I've ever heard.
Let me educate you guys a little bit here - first of all nothing that we have could ever shoot down a real extra terrestrial craft it just wouldn’t happen . These craft are protected by a field surrounding them . Second of all , galactic craft do not follow our physics. They just simply don’t they do things that we can’t comprehend because they don’t have to follow our physics. I know this from first hand experience.  This being woke me up and she was atleast 4ft tall and her craft had electricity on both sides of it and it shape-shifted  into the size of a basketball. So how the hell did she fit in it? It elongated and silently , slowly went through my ceiling.
Here's a very good starting POINT FOR YOU. ( EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT YOU IS ALIEN, THIS INCLUDE TANGIBLE AND NON TANGIBLE OBJECTS.)  ANOTHER WAY TO PUT THIS. (SAY YOU JUMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN, EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT YOU IS OCEAN OR PART OF THE OCEAN.) OKAY, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO WRAP YOUR LITTLE EINSTEIN MINDS AROUND THAT, RIGHT.
The human species have nothing to offer in uplifting our projects planet earth is merely an equivalent to what you refer to as a sandbox for experimentation We keep most of our activity to deep seculded Waters both salt and fresh water.  The pressure below the surface goes beyond your tolerance without with needed auxiliary equipment for your existance and survivability. Thus giving us secluded privacy without needing to ask permission from anyone.. The Waters are self cleaning and multi pressurized to meet our needs naturally without involving science, engineering, technology or any other of our cultural enclaves. And the environmental privacy is almost priceless. We what you refer to as ALIEN are NOT BIO NOR ARE WE SYNTHETIC NOR MINERAL WE SOMEWHAT AS A THOUGHT NOT FROM A BIO SOURCE. EXTRATERRESTRIAL ARE SOMEWHAT BIO NOT EARTHLY BIO A DIFFERENT SPACE AND TIME BIO.
All this is a huge huge distraction for klaus Shwabb putting the “great reset “ in full effect. If aliens were always real then they are purposely coming out with it now for a reason. Regardless the whole world will be begging for an alien life form to come kill us all after we have klaus Shwabb as our global leader see for yourself
As of the government is ever going to tell us the truth.
IF IT WAS A UAP THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SHOOT IT DOWN
NOTHING MYSTERIOUS ABOUT INTERMITTENT  ELECTRONIC INTERFERENCE.
That's a little naive, there are hundreds of thousands of people who can't explain what they have seen in our skies,i am one of them
Turns out there were 8 to 9 "objects" and as they were being approached by fighters near Dead Horse they each took off in various directions but they were able to down at least one of them and it's the one they are talking about here.  Speculation is that one of the US's/Skunkworks (UAP) Crash Retrieval Teams, CRT's,  have taken the lead on it's removal. If that is the case there will be no more info coming out about it.  It will simply not exist in the books anymore and the government or whoever will say they were unable to retrieve it and they will not be anymore info available.  In essence, "move along there is nothing to see here.
Look over there, not here! Where they are passing unconstitutional bills and executive orders.
9 months later and still no news or pictures. Air Force claims to not have recovered anything and has ended the search. I call BS. I emailed a man who works in the press for the Airforce and asked about the incident and received no reply. I live in Myrtle Beach,SC and witnessed the shooting down of the Chinese "Spy" balloon and felt like we should be given some answers down here considering these recent new events.
Pity it's CNN because they are part of the systems lies to defraud it's customers and the public. Shun MSM ,
Please give us an update on this.
They shot down an alien craft, For them, It's old news. For us its sensational.
This was eight months ago but have we heard any updates
Eight months later and still no word about what they found in the debris.
Wow! Is that lady ever a genuine hi-speed 'motor' mouth.  Perhaps I should record her speaking/s and play 'em back a wee bit slower ... ? As for the object, I imagine its final transmission home was something like (translated)— — "We're here now at the green planet. So far the natives appear to be frien         "
I have been saying Putin said he wants Alaska back. Stop the Obsession with  the Southern Border.  Putin is the Enemy.  Russia  & China ships were both of the Coast of Alaska.
"Looks like little bits of rubber"?
I don't understand how a comment I wrote 8 months ago, turns up on a current news program that I did not watch.
More US paranoia.
Eat the rich and beware of the industrial military complex
This report says they recovered debris, while the other reports say they couldn't get to the debris and didn't recover anything.
Tired of people thinking that these are another country. Truth is, IF another country had this technology....especially a country that has issues against us, we wouldn't be here right now. The fact of the matter is, we are on the verge of the realization that we are not alone. We've become an aquarium for whatever is flying these things.
They’re downplaying it the wreckage 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Have no idea where it came from? Then the next logical question is  what planet it came from??
US government: "dont storm area 51, thats stupid and youll get killed" Also US government: * starts war with an advanced alien civilization *
Hmmm...
But balloons don't have aliens in them...smiling at us!!!
Hmmm...call the thing a balloon... repeatedly...lolol
I can hear it now; don't saw it was a UFO...
I don't believe a word that CNN says they waste everyone's time!!! The next thing they'll try to get us to believe is that Joe is a good guy!!!
The FBI will cover it up and sweep it under the rug
They should not be shooting down aliens or UFOs. They've been here longer than we have. They're just trying to ramp up a false flag type of scenario are secret space program black government NASA they've all known about them for years. I know because I lived in a UFO hotspot in California and I saw them starting in 1969 day in and day out flying right over my house. And you can't tell me that our government didn't know about them back then everything Dr Greer says about the secret space program and our government back engineering and having a secret Fleet fleets is true don't believe a word of it when they say that they're only now just looking into it that's a bunch of BS
Oh wow the true beginnings of Disclosure!!..
Our government is what we need to fear.  When cnn is telling us something just know they are doing this for misdirection. Yes i believe aliens are real, do i fear thwm....absolutely not. If they are here they are more advanced and thwy could have taken us put a long time ago. They are probably here to warn us about the government and companies like blackrock and vangaurd. Infact i eant to talk to the aliens and see if they can help us all since our government is shit.
Lmao good old Jim from CNN
No  more  BS  from  you  people  !  We  have  ET  craft  .  We  have  ET  working  in  DUMB's  .  Maui  fire  -  cop's  blocked  main  road  ,  no  water  turned  off  ,  microwave  tec.  !   The  gov.  lie's  .  Tell  the  dam  truth   !   cnn  .
As a conscious human being i feel violated at the lack of knowledge on the truths of this existence
5:10 "ONE THAT I HV SEEN WAS GOING MARCH 6 !'"
the fact that CNN is reporting this I don't believe one word of it.
Great! Let's see if we can start a war with the advanced folk who have anti-gravitic flight now ? Just dumb !
They are lying.  It's amazing how smart some people brag about until they need to act dumb
The white house controls the FBI  this could be a total diversion F-22 pilots sneaking to the press is suspect in it's self pull your heads out of your backsides I promise you this is propaganda
HERE AGAIN FAKE NEWS !  TITLE SAID  ". HEAR WHAT PILOTS SAID "  TOTAL LIE !   PILOTS SAID NOTHING !  REPORTERS SAID !  WHICH MEANS NOTHING !  REPORTER SAID DON'T KNOW WHAT OBJECT WAS , DON'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM DON'T KNOW WHERE IT GOING  , DON'T KNOW WHAT PROPULSION IT HAD REPORTERS DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEIR TALKING ABOUT ! THEY ACTUALLY DIDN'T DO ANY REAL RESEARCH TO REPORT REAL FACTS EXCEPT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE AND DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY INFORMATION OTHER THAN WHAT PILOTS SAID AND WE DON'T HAVE ACTUALLY PILOTS THAT SAID ANYTHING BUT HERE IS WHAT WE SAID ! AND WANT THE VIEWER TO BELIEVE CNN WITH FACTUAL NEWS THAT ISN'T ! THEY CREATE INFORMATION ON THEIR VIEWS AND EXSPECT THE VIEWERS TO ACCEPT REPORT WITH NO REAL FACTS  TO BACK IT UP ! JUST HEARSAY.👎
This right here is just a waste of time about the unidentified object that they can't sing to to I can't even get my time back for watching this sb😢
Hey. Scoop.  Boy aren't you. The smart one
If you don't know what it is why. Report on anything. Seems. A little quick. To scoop the story
Sounds like the government is on top of this, I can sleep at night now. I have full trust that they have my best interests in mind.
HOW IS CNN EVEN IN BUSINESS STILL THERE FAKE NEWS AND SPREAD LIES, PROPAGANDA AND MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION
Cnn sucks
China testing readiness. Incoherent US leadership in place and a perfect time to test response time and head on over to Taiwan.
❤Dr. Steven Greer says the ET's have never harmed anyone. These folks have not seen his movie 'Undisclosed' Or 'Above Top Secret' 👍
Apparently the senator hasn’t seen the vídeo footage which I don’t understand
Any update on their findings?
More BS from are Great Government 😮 All LIES PEOPLE🎉
The white ball ufos are Saiyans coming to see if were keeping up with our training duh
What a nice welcome we are giving our galactic friends  ? ?
Who ever it is, they have declared war! Peace
All the aliens 👽 are around frozen land and very cold water , that’s why nobody goes to Alaska to explore
They aren't showing any damn pictures!
Mach 6 ?
There are no Conflicting reports. Its smoke & mirrors type stufff. Baloons dont have a Propulsion system
It’s was a simple weather balloon.
Drones w jammers ..somebody wants to see what color to paint their planes
This is seven months later and no word to the public what it was. 🤔
Couldn't identify, or WOULDN'T?
🎉🎉clRKR
They won't allow missiles to leave their Silo's!
Mach 6… holy that would be a blast to fly
How about a follow CNN. What was it? No reports that it was a balloon from China or something like that?.… Therefore we know it must have been another UFO  that our military shot down.
Why shoot it down?
What a great story ,could a movie be made out of this
They better quit shooting them down
Im,confused I believe in ufo"s but dnt in CNN so fake news
Keep contacting your representatives for answers on these incidents!
Made in China/North Korea??
Natasha is HOT!!!
FBI analyzing...why not UaF?
What are they hiding?? No answers. Monumental silence
So..what happened??
Don’t these interceptor aircraft carry cameras ? If not ,why not ? Or is this all just rubbish reporting making smoke screens for the political class ? Again !
Govt admission of UFO existence, unknown metal material found from space, it's all adding up to an upcoming unveiling of alien existence. Stay tuned
If you really cluster fuck the whole show up just send in the Hammer's where everything's a nail .. Norad Really Norad .. is that the same Norad who monkey fucked 9/11 wouldn't scramble alert aircraft until after it was over..I wouldn't believe a weather report from our Military after all they have plans & programs in place using forest fires as a weapon ..
I just lost 5 minutes of my life that ill never get back
It is possible someone foreign or alien power, is testing US reaction times to UFO/UAE from being discovered to being shot down.   I think it exposed a major weakness showing total lax in security in US Defense Strategy and National Security and Public Safety.   Taking nearly 24 hours to attempt to identify and take down is way too long to deal with an unknown potential threat inside your backyard.  The weakness being, this was just one object.  What if multiple similar or different UFO/UAEs singly or in groups came across from different directions.  Worse still, what if they were armed with hidden weapons.  Much like the current US stealth bomber, but more advanced by coordinated effort by foreign powers or other.   The reaction time needs to be cut down from several hours going through  proper channels, protocol, (which cost lives) to under an hour at best.  The pilot having direct access to experts and the president via video link using specialized software so both have first hand, real time eyeball on the object to make a decision.  This should apply to all nations as Standard Operating Procedure, (SOP) regarding UFO/UAEs.   Hail, no response.  Firing a warning shot 1st across its path, no response. Fire 2nd to graze the UFO/UAE, no response.  Destroy UFO/UAE on order.  All within a few minutes of discovery on radar, launch of aircraft,  visual contact, approach, hail, firing 1st warning across its bow.  Just my humble view if I were Chief NSA.   What was the Navy/USAF doing while this was occurring.  Any UFO/UAE would need to be warned off immediately when crossing the 12 mile limit or land border.  These areas need to seriously tightened up, or next time it could be Pearl Harbor all over again, only it won't just be Pearl Harbor, it be the whole of the US.  If this was a trail run for a full scale attack, or a secret test for a potential attack on US soil.   The US failed miserably and it knows it, as does POTUS too in hindsight.   Especially after the Chinese balloon incident.   Complacency is the mother of all defeats.
blame china we know who you are.
i think this is fake news. its the kind of stories the nefarious mystery makers like to do perhaps to attract attention perhaps has some revenue gain somehow.
They don’t know anything. But they shot it…
Deep State flying object or alien
Swamp gas, balloons, alien flatulence,  chinese...our government is incredible.  How do these government idiots keep their boat floating? Well, with our tax money of course.
We also know they shot down a science classes weather balloon. It was a 33ft max (at 90k ft) balloon bought off amazon.  Not sure what the other things were though.  Very wierd that it was never talked about again after this day.
I think it's more of a mystery that you think you are real news and that people believe anything your propaganda  pretend news says.
Briben administration let Chinese spy balloons fly around our country for how long? Before doing anything about it. Disgraceful imo. Oh but wait briben let them get the info they needed first before he gave the order.
Under the hand of CIA, military or government. You will get nothing.  Case closed!
there is no chance that humans could shoot down an alien craft.
Here it is six months later. Has anyone heard anything new about wreckage retrieved other than what David Grush has told everyone?
*So what it is?*
It seems that we all know some know, who Dr Steven G
Pictures.... radar....???
The FBI...😂
Typical Usa to shoot first and ask later.
CNN is fake news
So how long is it going to take before they stopped blowing things up and fighting back
Yeah it was a pancake house
I think our military will instigate World War 3 so they won't have to reveal what they know about UAP secrets.
Prepping for the fake alien invasion
When children a small we using bogeyman  so we can keep them in fear that way we can train them to depend and  listen on us that’s why the listen to us because they think we can protect them from the bogeyman.     The question is, why you on government will use the same tactic?    Do you know the rules of the game, so you know they are lying to you?
Just because you have a military rank doesnt mean you cant be full of shit, gullible, or just plain wrong.      I believe these pilots mean well, but its getting hilarious.
It never happened, its fake news, lol.
What is the latest?  Did they ever recover it and report findings?
Stop dancing around the truth. And, why did this story just disappear? Stop blaming China .
The CIA analyst casts aspersions on the possibility that it was another UFO shot down by the US. Note he said the F-35s, one of our technologically premier planes, had their systems disrupted by "frequency hopping," and he said it might have come from China or Russia (three times), and then he changed the subject to China's balloon. What a clown. UFOs and aliens are real. Admit it already. The US government would not have quietly created a new branch of the military, The US Space Force, if aliens didn't exist.
Well what was it
5 mo later there's been no talk on this
Enough distractions, when will the Bidens be held accountable for their crimes?
More lies
Only truth i ever seen c.n.n. report.
it was the Chinese test piloting their latest flying car - designed to overthrow US car sales.
Does anyone actually listen to CNN anymore??  Bit late to the party on the truth as usual. Mind you I would be willing to believe that the people on CNN are aliens, that would make sense
News no more foot work news is over.
They're going to call it a high-altitude balloon
The order to shoot down what is being called a unidentifiable object is the last shread of evidence that i believe is necessary to thoroughly answer the question of , ,  Are We Alone . Those who are asking that question all ready know the answer to that question and the Actions of those government officials who continuously believe that there will be no Repercussions from Entities that come from the COSMOS . The hypocrisy of saying that they believe in a Higher Power than themselves , a GOD and His SON that Walked , Talked and Lived among those who hated and despised him and tried and convicted him in their court of law . There's a saying , He who is with out SIN Cast the First Stone . Well , , that Stone was Cast and with the passage of Time Bombs have been made and Dropped on the HUMANITY of MANKIND . RETALIATION is the only method of understanding and that lesson will be bestowed on the endeavors of Mankind and it's Presents in the COSMOS . The International Space Station , Probes and TELESCOPES are fair game to be interfered with and molested . The areas in the Sky that are No Fly Zones will Not be recognized or respected the areas below the no-fly zones will be violated and harassed on an ever-increasing level till the Lessons becomes a Test .
I'd like some updates on this.
If it was shot down, I doubt if it was of alien (non earth) origin.  True alien craft can avoid being shot down by dodging missiles.
Whatever Happened to the Revealing of the Shot Down Thing?!?
We're all going too die, we never should've shot it down,#therehere
Yep they put one threw my warp drive.. sob...
Obviously one guy was harassed
Oh yea, frequency hopping… cool
could this be some kind of Russian drone
So a extraterrestrial aircraft capable of travelling over half a galaxy comes to earth with extremely advanced tech and the gov first instinct is to shoot it down . Everyone ready for war of the worlds 😂
This was 5months ago, and even with the current investigation by the Senate Sub Committee and the testimony of 3 well-respected whistleblowers. I watched the testimony of Dr Sean Kirkpatrick the director of ARRO, not one of the Senators asked him about this incident,  in fact, there were no questions at all about famous ufo sightings. it was all very staged also there has been nothing from the DOD since last February about the 4 different events, it's the same old story about balloons, well this balloon was the size of a car and metallic in form, please do they take us all for idiots. Going as far back as Roswell in the 50's That was the best they could do back then, incredibly they haven't come up with a better excuse to lie about. NASA spends billions looking for ET for us., and the DOD Pentagon spends even more billions of tax dollars hiding ET from us
u cant shot them down, imagine if they decide to retaliate we all r then doomed. we need to understand them without fking violence.
It's all BS folks.  Just ask Steven Greer.  He says they are man made. google it.
This is EXACTLY why "disclosure" is FINALLY happening in Congress+Pentagon+NASA about our Highly Advanced Visitors... 🛸🛸👽👽
They should not have shot it down for no reason.They must have known it was a UFO and they wanted it.
Still waiting to hear what pilots said .
Who's here from reddit?
5 months ago and still no follow up 😅
bidens deepfake advisors telling him to shoot ofc
Why shoot down something you can't identify crazy
😂😂😂😂😂
Natasha is a smokeshow
What a bs excuse of why it would interfere with radio equipment on the billion-dollar plane! And shooting at something that you don't know what it is very stupid idea to approach it hostile!
Based on how the News Anchor Sounds, you can know it's fake. This is not UFO of Aliens
America is failing in so many ways, yet the media is consumed with UFO'S when we should be talking about the major issues... Economy, education,  poverty, inflation, the dollar slipping as the trading currency....
She said f35 pilots shot it down but the graphic said f22s shot it down so I don't believe anything any of these people say
BOB LAZAR EXPLAINS ANTI GRAVITY...You Tube
WE HAVE A SECRET SPACE FLEET Code name SOLAR WARDEN. Huffington Post UK.
Here's hoping it's the Vogon destructor fleet coming to blow us up to make way for the new intergalactic super highway. That will fix a lot of problems 😅
One came down over the flightline. The whole base saw it.
I almost told a top secret, about flying objects?! Its from here...
RAY GUN?!
If you shoot down a flying saucer without a ray gun? Its not from outter space.
Same crap over and over bla bla bla nobody knows nothing
If they are aliens they can't be too bright to keep coming here and getting shot down. Frankly I think it's man made UFO's that are crashing or being shot down
Literally no follow up to any of these things shot down. Nothing anywhere
CNN is reporting on this?? Damn they must want everyone to stop paying attention to the Biden crime syndicate real BAD!
Yeah, because shooting down potentially other life form UFOs is really a smart idea....?
Oh yeah, now how are we supposed to believe university educated, admittedly well trained combat pilots, with tested high intelligence, reaction times, observation skills, and physical abilities when they say these things?? It was just a party balloon, of course!!!!!!!!!!!!!....of..course!!! And so what! A couple F-35 jets lost advanced top secret tech systems, which were shut down when they got to close to the party balloon!! Happens all the time at home! I forget to turn off a light when I leave or turn the lights on in my car, or, or, or, um, you know like when i accidently change the radio station and things like that! They just accidently bumped a switch type thingy!!!!! THERE! Disproved these so called flying pilots haha.... That was easy! I'm sure I could start a debunker channel and become rich! Being a science type guy is easy!!!!!!!
Once Joe Biden was reassured that it definitely wasn't Chinese, he was happy enough to have it shot down straight away. As soon as he had his pudding and his nap. "Other planetarians? C'mon man. Do the gun...shooing..y'know..the thing."
One of the objects was thougth to be Chris Christy's presidential campaign - barely got off the ground, then exploded seconds later.
It's not Russia or China. Blame Canada!
Five months later still nothing. They're hoping everyone has forgotten all about it.
😂
These are carefully mixed up statements that confuse faster than sound baloons with real super fast machines, to buffer the coming stories for the supposed childlike people who "can't handle the truth". Yes we can. "Baloons" don't go as fast as mach...one.
🎉🎉🎉NEPHILIM 🎉🎉🎉 SKEPTICS ARE OBSOLETE 🎉🎉🎉 REPENT. CHRIST/GOD WENT TO HELL AND CONQUERED IT FOR YOU🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
FBI heads will never tell us
Stopped watching as soon as Robert opens with "pilots going too fast to really see properly..."
Was it really  F-35s that shot it down or was it really an F-22
Bread and circuses! Keeps your mind off of the disasters that are coming . Never do we see proof just talk . Anything you see flying in the sky is made here on earth . Balloons from China didn’t work . This is the next step .
Chinese spy stuff!
👽👾
Russian Armed Forces are the biggest threat to the security of Europe, NATO and the World. I invite and call on all citizens of Sweden, Netherlands, UK, Portugal, Canada, Poland, Colombia, Greece, Austria, Brazil, France, the USA, Czechia, Argentina, Germany, Japan, Belgium, Finland, Italy, Romania and Spain to fight for democracy. If Ukraine is invaded, there will never be peace in Europe. In European countries, the situation will be the same as in Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Bangladesh, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Niger, Iraq and Afghanistan. Citizens of these countries serve in the Russian Army. Ilham Aliyev and Nicolas Maduro supplies diesel and oil to the Russian army. Killer Vladimir Putin is looking for an excuse to use nuclear weapons. If the Russian army is defeated, an atomic bomb will be dropped on Helsinki, London, Kyiv, New York, Brussels and Warsaw. If Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kaliningrad, Crimea, Donbas are attacked, the Russian army will launch Topol-M with a nuclear warhead. Kim Jong Un, Alexander Lukashenko, Xi Jinping, Ebrahim Raisi sends weapons and ammunition to Russia. But the Belarus-Ukraine war will never happen. Vladimir Putin will not open a 2nd front. Because Alexander Lukashenko does not want to fall into the quagmire where his friend fell.
The Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant in Armenia was chosen as the most dangerous reactor in the world due to its design in the 1960s. The nuclear reactor should have been shut down a long time ago. Because it spreads radiation to Europe and other continents. Radioactive and chemical wastes of the Nuclear Power Plant enter the Caspian Sea through rivers and then into the oceans through other rivers. The NPP is located in a seismic country and a strong earthquake can occur at any time. Armenia should be sanctioned and embargoed to close this reactor. This environmental terrorism must be stopped. The number of cancer patients in the world is increasing rapidly due to nuclear power plants. The government of Armenia, which is a military-economic ally of the invading Russia and receives financial and military support from it, should think about the health of the peoples of Europe.
Youtube wants us to watch History Channel  only.
Robert seems guarded and like he is censoring his answers but as time goes on in the interview he becomes more and more confident and starts to let out just a few things from Pandora’s box. That then leads to him needing to explain another detail about the first thing and before you know it he’s telling you heaps of stuff and you can hear in his tone that he is distressed by it all.
They never found any of the debris supposedly
"it was a weather balloon..."
The only reason aliens don't show up in Florida is because they consider the average Florida man more dangerous then the military one can say the average Florida man is the real alien
What’s Hunter up to now?
Funny the biggest best greatest military on Earth can't locate wreckage of three shoot downs .. yeah right. Another story the mainstream media seem to just .. ignore?. Why is that I wonder?
We still dont know if that so called Chinese spy balloon wasn't  just a weather balloon.
Everybody forgets about this... The public has been trained ( or I'd more so rather call it "forcibly handicapped, as well as intellectually damaged and robbed of what sense in awareness that we once had") and I'm certain that all this has been purposefully done through the devices that keep us all connected, much like the one I'm using right now to post this comment... They count on us becoming thoughtless, conforming, and completely void of being capable of keeping any sort of attentiveness that would be otherwise detrimental to our survival, along with so many other evolutionary traits that which we no longer have, yet all of which our ancestors before us had developed, in order to bring us into existence.... Sadly, it has now proven to all be in vain...  We Americans are the worst of it... We're too detached from the real possible threat of suffering the horrors of war and experiencing the worst, most unfathomable and appalling things which human beings are capable of, if they're truly felt compelled to do so...   Why don't I see more people wondering or inquiring for any more explanation of this event by now??? It's been like 6 fucking months and still there have been absolutely no further information on these incidents since here, when they were first initially reported!!!!  Come on, Everybody!!! We need to demand some answers, damnit! I'M AN AMERICAN!!! WE'RE ALL AMERICANS, GODDAMNIT!!! RONALD REAGAN WOULD BE ASHAMED OF US!!! 😡🫡🤨🤔😡😠🇺🇲🇺🇲
China is probably launching these things from their bases on the Arctic. Probing to see if we have any defenses.
Sure, shoot at more intelligent life that can drop a virus on us that makes us disappear. Do not shoot at aliens. Thanks.
Shooting down alien craft can produce serious consequences. Some take this as an act of war and will retaliate. I guess we will have to continue to digest the lies and see what happens.
Anymore it's just so hard to take seriously anything CNN reporters have to say. I have given up on them as they are the voice of the spin doctors. Always full of BS
No Alien crafts! They are all USA spying machines. Or china’s.
* red neck military cowboy man pissed about foreign cars *    " ill tell ya what got shot down dammit , its one of hem dam new flying four door cars !, sumbitch flew into restricted air space hem dam new off road options , unknown propulsion system my ass dam factory just aint released the schematics on them new cars yet " * soldier retrieves smoldering owners manual * " ill tell you how the sumbitch flys after i read this foreign shit " ( picture tommy lee jones as hawk but hawks pissed about foreign cars )
After months of trying to further this story to find out the details, they have  “magically” disappeared.. there has been zero response from the government or the pilots in question (which I have reached out to personally)   There is a good chance this story comes with some pretty compelling facts that hit a bit too close to home for the gov bodies in control of classified information. It’s highly likely this was a bonafide craft and that the pilots who shot it down are now muzzled.
If chinese, that's grossly irresponsible of them. CCP/"Peoples Liberation Army", all chinese nationals have to deal with conscription, (they never leave the army).
For the aliens, this could be the shot heard 'round the world. I don't think that we should be attacking their equipment.
I didn’t actually hear CONFLICTING reports from the pilots.
Starting a war thay can't win
Everytime its a different jet. Is it f-35's or f-22 fighter jets?
Doesn’t anyone have a camera?
Its like Roswell all over again .... a UFO turns out to be a weather balloon!!!!
Let us look for r self.
Well now the DoD will.say, see we do.have a recover team,  but this is just a China "weather balloon" pls...what a Joke.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS, BUT I'M GONNA SHOOT IT DOWN ANYWAY! IF IT WAS A UFO or just someone who got lost, IS THERE ANY QUESTION WHY THEY DON'T CONTACT THE PEOPLE OF EARTH!
No follow up story as usual
Story is 4 months old.....so what was it
What it is, is extraterrestrial beings, yes, aliens are real.
the five eyes have the key to the ufo secrets. follow the money
Wish we could have an update on what was found... Probably be hidden for 50 years...
"I don't want to get carried away here", says the man who made a complete ass of himself for 4 years doing exactly that.
This is the next step in their propaganda..they are to project a UFO/ alien invasion to only ultimately bring all worldly governments together and to conform as one....NWO is near
I doubt that our primitive weapons could shoot down extraterrestrial tech.
Stop shooting at my aliens
Welcome to Earth. Pew pew.
Where is the debris?
Did you just say the FBI are in charge, that means you won't find out any more about that.
Time to google earth over Alaska 😂
Any updates on this?
Any updates in light of recent Congressional action on UAP?
"We'll know more when they recover the wreckage."  So, what was the outcome? It is now July, '23, and I never heard or read about any conclusions reached about what was shot down. It wouldn't be the first time the U.S. government has been elusive about what strange objects are flying in our airspace.
So what happened with all the recovered debris?  You don’t shoot down something that you have no idea what it is and doesn’t pose an imminent threat.  And stop using the ‘balloon’ excuse as it’s insulting to these trained military pilots.  Even to an untrained layman one can distinguish between a balloon vs other aircraft.  So they used a couple of $1M missiles  to shoot down a supposed ‘balloon’,  the explanation or lack of boggles the mind.   Clearly it’s not of anything from Earth, otherwise they would  show the world what it was if it was of Chinese/Russia or commercial origin.  The secrecy  surrounding the UFO topic in government needs to cease.  If they are not of extraterrestrial origin and does not pose a threat to national security then why all the secrecy and extraordinary efforts to conceal it over the last 70 years.  After all F35 have sophisticated  sensors to detect, track and photograph and take videos of this craft.  Why haven’t they been shown to the American public to dispel the extraterrestrial conspiracy?
Military Industrial Criminal Syndicate  will want that craft back?
im less worried about aliens than im worried about pervayers of fake news
So do you guys watch these lies and feel better or do you watch these lies and still feel confused?
That's  from earth. They found out in another planet like that. That look like satelite.
The object may have a problem with its electromagnetic cloaking device. Keeping a triple pumped waveguide accurate to 2 lambda is difficult, especially  in low temperatures that can cause differential thermal expansion. That would explain why it interfered with their sensors and also why they could see it at all.
Doesn't make sense because it's not from China, why would you say it is, your making this shit up, stop speculating.
FBI AND CIA ALL WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT THEY CAN'T SAY ANYTHING COME ON PEOPLE!! I LAUGH WHEN THEY TURN IT OVER TO AN FBI GUY!!!!!  COME ON MAN SNAP OUT OF IT!!!!!!!😮😮
WE THINK WE KNOW IT ALL BUT WE KNOW SHIT!! WE JUST STARTED GOING INTO SPACE!! TIME FOR EVERYONE TO WAKE THE (HELL UP)
@cnn it was a weather Ballon...great job on your fake reporting as usual though ....anything to take the headlines of the bs bidens pulling huh
funny how the news act like they dont know what that was or this "cia" operative lol . every news outlet is playing dumb. they know better cuz the men in black are listening to their every word
Ask what your Government is hiding from you.
Aliens are probably  Saying Let's see how dumb these humans really are They are ready destroyed the Earth They  Already Destroyed the Earth Let's see what else They can f*** up
Maybe they'll come up with a balloon story Or maybe swamp gas Oh I know  It was flavors Extraterrestrials  Already know Humans are an idiot
By the description is sounds like Rick Sanchez is flying around out there!
Is it a coincidence that the UFO whistle blower comes out a few weeks after this story??
Thats bc the pilots will shoot even pigeons and claim its a ufo
Oh great, the FBI is taking control. There findings are right next to Epstein’s client list and Hunter Biden’s laptop
None of those pilots should be allowed to fly jets maybe go by a model plane for 10 bucks tjats what they are qualified to do
Shooting baloons thats their pilots brilliant aren't they
They shot down a.balloon with a million dollar missle lol a clown show
And then again there were the Foo Fighters of WWII named by the allied pilots who reported them but so did German pilots. We can then conclude that this aerial phenomena has been around for a long time.🤔
It was my daughters giant birthday balloon. You used $100.000 missles to destroy my Daughters balloons. You B*******s
Yeah, I'm sure the cia guy is going to be perfectly forthcoming about everything. 🤨
Really ,  they shot it down ?  Maybe it's manmade .
Why does it take so long for information to get to the public? Isn't our government supposed to work for us? I don't want to be represented by people who immediately shoot at something we don't understand. If the tech allows these craft to baffle our military and we dont know what they are, is it wise to immediately blast them? What if it is aliens? Do you want to be hostile towards a civilization that can solve our problems and teach us to warp travel? It seems that the government no longer works for our best interests.
Could be that they have been doing it for years and we just caught it now.
4 months on and zero updates about this?
Sounds like something from of the old west -- "shoot first and talk later".   Is this what we;re turning into????
Wouldn't it be nice to be told the truth.
Not surprised by this, Alaska is the biggest UFO hot spot in the world. Bet we don't hear the interview of the pilots.
The threat is obviously from within. Who starts a war with a highly technologically advanced superior power? Ahhh, yes. Uncle Sam.
It is possible for a spy balloon having no data acquisition or even data sending capability to nevertheless perform an effective spying function.
😊❤
Si diferent things priblablement
rinse and repeat since Roswell , Will be a balloon , in the end
Im just worried about my social security benefits in the future... Thats scarier than possible aliens
Since when can they “ shoot down” a UFO/UAP that can go from 0 - 50,000 MPH in 1 second. THIS is Faked by the Government.
can't ever beat a 🐎 !!!!!!!
It's always talk with no evidence.  Show the scientific community evidence.
I find it hard to believe that any military could shoot down a UFO. A balloon, yes. But not a craft that's as technologically advanced as UFOs are.
Dont shoot at the UFO 👽
The joke here is Biden being notified, Biden doesn't even know what day it is.
BS alert!
My favorite Martian.
Yea let the FBI hold all the information we see how they love to give that over to Congress...
WTF? Are they saying the Alaska object was a real unknown UAP?
Probably Chinese
And still CNN hasn't said anything concerning David Grusch. CNN is state controlled propaganda
Lol China. listen, if you believe UAP traveling at mach 6 with no flight control surfaces or visible meana of propulsion then YOU are part of the dumb public. YOU are part of the problem.
🛸👽
This was 4 months ago. So we still haven't been told anything?  Does anybody know anything ? Meaning the general public. ???
😂😢.. 👉🏻👉🏼👉🏽 America calls it "Liberation" instead of "Invasion". That was what US call it in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and the list goes on... Why the double standard?

Ask Garry Nolan about the debris ?
If these UFOs can change location in the blink of an eye, why cant they dodge en air to air missle?
So no one from the fed decided to take a photo? Oh the FBI? Former CIA? The military construct controls us. Where is the evidence of this? No one in that town thought to take a photo?
Your government was always lying to Your US-people about UFOS or reverse engineered UFOS. Your deep state is a threat to the hole world.
They are Alien craft
Amazing how a few days later, all attempts to recover the debris were reported called off and nothing more was said about this.   This makes no sense at all.  The sea is very shallow off northern Alaska.
Natasha Bertrand so hawwwtt
When military engages first, its serious, the fact the we still don't know what it was that was shot down, if it retaliates, we are all screwed.
In the early 90's as i was driving, i looked up and saw a silver crome like bottom of an airplane.  Problem is i could not see the entire vehicle.  It was invisible but for the cigar shaped bottom.   It wasn't very very high and i heard no noise as i should've. It moved differently than our aircraft.  Once it got more closer to Mercer Island WA it disappeared.
Not from CnN.
No way we shot down an alien spaceship. It has to be a Chinese balloon 😂
The US shot down 4 spy ballons in total.
Ya the public is not allowed to know. its always the same story. the Hunter Biden laptop is also a secret   lololololo never to be explained by the Media lolololol
So they are shooting down UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS, Not even knowing if its an Airplane, a Bigfoot or a balloon ,  Just shoot lol😅😂🇺🇸🍻✌🏻Pew pew pew.
The Aliens are time traveler's from the future. They are not aliens coming from different planets just us from the future, traveling back  into the past coming from different points in time.
Why is the guest talking so much about Chinese balloons and not the unidentified object with no identifiable propulsion system??
Uhhh the stating of the propulsion system being unknown is a common occurance since its literally a check box on the incident form filled out by a pilot that maybe got one glance at something flown by at 500mph.   Anybody in aviation would know this.  Anybody in media with cnn level credituals would also know this.  So knowing that cnn is no fool and they are posting foolish statements meant to suggest something provocative....  Its a pathetic ratings grab at the least  Or some state sponsored madness at the worst
Wth do we keep doing business with China ? Maybe cuz of the democrats who give our business to a communist regime , how stupid are our politicians  have to be while they line our pockets !
The same Sedona why the Chinese are now sending there illicit drugs into this country while the incompetent democrats don’t do a dam thing !
I think the government is giving out a bunch of bd information  without ever revealing any facts at all  never saying exactly wth it was or actually shot down supposedly ??
Well how come they never showed what was shot down or the recordings of the pilots?
It's crazy they just fired at something they couldn't identify
And there was no pics by the government of what they retrieved !
So, this report was three months ago.  Have they released what it actually is?  Or what they want us to believe?
Now we have a top military intelligence agent exposing the government for harboring alien spacecraft
Today and still no identification of this object?
EX CIA ???? MY KID CAN GIVE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS COULD BE THAN CIA IDIOT. PUTTING ALL OF US AS "STUPID BOX'
Forget the news
Baahhhh!   No such thing as aliens 👽 👾   It's either demons or man (made) ....   To say otherwise is blasphemous!
The one and only spaceship that we actually successfully shoot down and it had to be in some far off remote frozen tundra.  Couldn't have been in a field in Kanas, nope, then you'd have thousands of people to actually see something.  Okie Dokie
ET PHONE HOME
"let's talk heavily about what we don't know"  How about we cut the crap and skip to the chase?
Why you talking about F-35 when is cleared that F-22 RAPTOR shoot it dovn? Did it interifer with F-22 Sensor suit or with f-35 5-gen sensor fusion package? Becouse anyone that is in aviation knows that F-22 RAPTOR is a 4-Gen Fighter platform  and F-35 is a 5+ Gen platform with state off the art Sensors and it is INFERIOR when comared to Raptor in sensor package and beiond visual capability (It is like you compare Cellfone Camera with RED CAM orr ARRI (Producer off some of most capables PROFESIONAL CAMERA)  I Dont want to make fun of f-22 Raptor in fact it is highly capable plane,but F-22 is going in to historry and canot compare orr be upgraded to F-35 sensor are standard's so iff you allready chose to made a storry you shuld at least do research what GENERATION off PLANES ARE IN SKY AND DID 4-GEN OR 5-GEN PLANE SHOOT IT DOWN??????????????Peace............
And now we have the whole "whistle blower " stuff goin on! I feel like thing might have got a little wild!
There's no way it was not from earth! Alien craft to travel here and we shoot it down, yeah sure!!!! Lololololol
Odd, they've not yet released any details of the debris 3 months later!👽
Aliens
No pilot would be given clearance to report they didn't know what they shot down. Lies and propaganda
This is bullshit. Does anyone believe what these people say anymore? A UFO that's managed to turn all our nukes offline, do 180 degrees turns at Mach 3 , could wipe us off the planet in an hour. All the old Sumerian tales say they had nukes 4,000 years ago. They created us and no way are we in the same league as them. They expect us to believe that suddenly we have the technology to take them down?? I doubt it very much
They keep saying china, come on, its not from this world. So now they have the shot down object and should let us know what is it. Its not china.
There was a mini invasion, and the ballon thing was a orchestrated cover up. World governments are conspiracy together..
OK alien shit ..
It was a FRICKEN off world tech looking thing..
There was a news feed from Alaska, they had a uap on the back of a flat bed.. the pic was taken down,  they lie ???
How come we haven't beard anything else about these objects. They completely stopped reporting on them on Feb 13 and nothing else was said. That's crazy. Almost makes jt sound more extraordinary
Yea UFO😮
Its a need to know basis and we need to not know 😂
Sounds like some people are designing another invention.
Im still furious till this day our own government Lied to us about waht these were! Even if they were balloons from china they should have shown us!!!
15 For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.  16 For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many.  17 They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.
Seems like they are trying to make us think that all the pilots that have reported UAP could have been wrong. They are trying to put toothpaste back in the tube and it's not gonna work!
If balloons are the best surveillance  equipments that China has,then that should tell us something.
Ridwan
If aliens were hostile we would know we are more hostile jeez
Any ET found alive ?
These people say so much and Nothing at all at the same time...smh. We have to understand when people are speaking and operating in Grey areas. The guy Interviewed..."Some kind of Propulsion.." Bruh really??? If You dont know say you dont know and move along pls..Let us that want to know and understand not have so much BS interference. #Ivish
So, what does the Galactic Federation have to say about this act of aggression? this is intergalactic incident forced by US
Let’s face it. If they knew what it was, and it had originated from another country, they’d be tripping all over themselves to tell us the story. Instead they’re covering it up.
Any news?  Nobody is talking about...
It's gonna be a "balloon" :D.
Funny thing is the Russians and Chinese see they objects and think they are ours so either one or both sides have classified projects they pretend they don't know about, or these are not made by homo sapiens, or both.
Why didn't they shoot down one of the UAPs that were buzzing US navy ships for two weeks off both coasts?  How can you have ufos buzzing US ships for two weeks and not trying to " capture / shoot " one down to examine the debris.?
He said he had a object moving at mach 6 and Jim just says "wow" and moves on....🙄
I mean, USAF must have realised people will be highly curious about this. Did nobody think to try and take a video with a phone? Nah, we’ll just let the whole thing be steeped in mystery. Thanks.
Government experimental program
It’s us from the future it’ll step up more the closer we get to ww3
Three months later and still no explanations. WHY!!!
Are the aliens vaccinated?
U F O!!!!
CNN is trash news! Hold them accountable!
Do we have an update on this
The American government is corrupt they’re going to keep hiding things and three months and what are they going to give us some more bullshit lies
The F35 pilots are surely trained on air vehicles. But they couldn’t identify the flying object. We hope the US govt will disclose to public what the object is and not just a balloon
UFO
Norad simply not prepared!! Scary
It's CNN people. This is a cover up for another Chinese balloon flying over our country. CNN works for the government people it's a pure propaganda machine like all the other MSM.
the old military industrial complex pulling our strings from the cnn stage 🙄
Gotta love the 24 hour news cycle: they can stretch 2 min of information amd stretch it out for days.
That's government for ya !,
So what the hell was it?! It's been months now and NOTHING!
The facts are out there. It isn’t ufo 😂 look into gov. They already have the tech
We have all these sophisticated satellites that can read a license plate on a car, but it couldn't track this object to know where it came from?  Someone isn't being completely honest with us.
This guy is deflating this event. He has no clue what was flying up there but pretends to know it is chinese. Calls them all balloons. Mach six? Oh....
I accept them if they come I don’t praise them but I accept them… as long as they get citizenship and just chill I’m okay with that.
2 months later: no photos, no videos, no information on wreckage recovery…… why?
CIA Double speak.
There needs to be an independent investigation.
Sooooo.... Have there been any updates on what these things were? Or was it indeed a diversion
If they shot it down, so where is it?
if it is aliens the government will say its something else and lie to the public
Thought 2023 would be so peaceful after all the chaos since 2020. But now....
When the government recovers it, they will say it's a weather ballon
I'd like an update on this story~ It's been 2 months.
Funny how people automatically leap to the "It's Aliens" scenario lol It is possible, but I doubt that's what this thing is. We need to know its velocity and the atmospheric conditions first. How something moves and how fast it's going provides far more good information than what it looks like, I know from experience. UFO's UAV's whatever you want to call them are real, of that I am certain because I've seen them and the way they moved proved to me and 2 other witnesses that these objects are highly advanced non-conventional crafts. They're either developed here under the secrecy of black budget projects, or they're not from Earth. I'd bet the farm it's both. But whatever debris is found in this case, I highly doubt the government will be forthcoming with the truth about it anyway, unless it assists the narrative of their political propaganda.
So they’re not even gonna acknowledge the possibility of it being aliens SMH
Not surprised at all. Their everywhere.
well whatever this object turns out to be the american people can be rest assured all of the important details will be kept secret from them
China Big Spy Drone Dji.
When CNN reports the news.  Beware of deception and misinformation.
At 3:38 the journalists has to say something to discredit the story....good job CNN!
Typically American, Guns a - blazing. Be it an elementary school, a church, or "I don't know." Fuggem.
So it has been a.couple of weeks now, is there any follow up on this story?
Lizzid People😂
Natasha =lies
Must be tru🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤡🇺🇸🤮🤮🤮
Mind if to the US Military, why not add a "last to minute" camera system onboard the missile. It could be a video or an image snapshot of the "target" before it's collision or impact. Can be calibrated it's distance to activate before it hits the target. Just like those drones have cameras, but this time were only for seeing/snapping a video/image before impact. The image/video is automatically sent to the source.
Keep in mind that the pilots sent up to intercept this object are highly trained observers with sensitive instruments which go far beyond our five senses. They are the guardians of our air space and have the latest information about known Chinese and Russian aircraft as well as experimental designs. I am startled that they have no idea what they were looking at. It might also be important that it appeared differently to individual observers. We really know very little about what we call "reality."
Maybe the regular military just shot down a black ops deep state advanced propulsion vehicle, I'm just sayin
So it begins the information and disinformation false flag that will eventually lead to a jump in military spending 20 fold , while people die of poverty related issues and illnesses.
Really china? Don't listen this is obvious disinformation... These are actual military crafts being shot by our own military crafts to push a false flag narrative
how about FALSE ALIEN INVASION WHERE THE ONLY FALSE THING IS THE ALIENS CAUSE THE ATTACKS WILL BE REAL JUST SO THERE IS ONLY ONE GLOBAL GOVERNMENT, WAKE UP HUMANS
Why is the first option to destroy it ? Why not attempt communication or reconnaissance first if it was an alien it wouldn't realise it was endangering anyone at any altitude
So no one's mentioned Russia lol
C,N,N fake news. Didens canpaners. News of the woke crap.
BOB LAZAR
The UFO made them see it as different objects . It was in a movie
I would more like to know the experience to be up at 60,000ft
They aren't going to tell u crap good luck speculating
Look I want an all out UFO invasion as much as anyone BUT I seriously don't think our aircraft will be just plucking interstellar /dimensional ships outta the sky.That is unless they are alien probes!  Had to say it to really worry the paranoid out there. The Govt/Military is not gonna let you know the real deal..it's all need to know info.
Back then the government would never admit to these things now there talking about it. So when the truth comes out were not surprised
so whatever happened with this story? Did they ever  tell us what the debris showed? Story just seemed to  vanish after a week.....
How about a update  ?
What happened with this?. 2 months after and nothing. Nothing was recovered?
I am screaming with laughter!
If it is anything, they wouldn't tell you
It was Trumps hair piece
pentagons been lying since 1947...we know exactly what they are.
Smokescreen 🤦🏻‍♂️
So where is it now????
Oh fuck yeah, I totally believe this now that CNN said it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Biden scares me more than aliens
and not a peep following
Those objects are man made and the US definitely needs to shoot them down and figure out who  constructed them. Some country has developed new advanced tech and we need to know exactly what it can do .
There no actual pictures of the event to the public about what happens just people spinning the truth, just totally untrustworthy.
They should have invited one of those pilots instead of this chick
Any follow up on these events?
Ee Tea Cumed Homé
HEAR MORE CNN FAKE BULSHIT - PUSHING YOUR COMPLETELY FAKE REALITY
The Chinese have Mach 6  balloons now ?  I'd love to see the warning on the packaging .
What's even more impressive is that we sent up F-35's but somehow  it was shot down by an F-22 ?  I'm wondering if it was Will Smith cruising around in his own F-22 ?  He is the "go to" for these kind of potential  alien situations .
I feel like Obama leaving was like Y2K for the world
It is not alien is another Chinese craft. The government is trying to stoke fear in us to hide their incomptence.
So what was it
Oh really they shut that one down is that what you're trying to tell us.  Then where's the report on what they shut down where is the debris did you bother asking about that as a follow-up know because you don't do news you do b*******you should all be doing the weather
Haven't heard a word about this "incident". Radio silence says a lot.
So is Jim Acosta telling the truth this time?? The dude has a track record of spewing bull shit so….
This guy being interviewed is playing it down, wake up !
If the aliens visit the earth what the government can do.
Does anyone believe wot the cia say 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️ literally no credibility they started the downfall of there own country to fight gorilla wars - 2 words - crack cocaine
Come on restore my faith in humanity... disclose it all! All fun and games until the et's disarm and shoot down nukes when they get fired from china or Russia and then the et's EXPOSE themselves 2 EVERYONE bc they are unhappy about how 🤔 hostile and volatile the world truly has become...its called %uck around... And your gonna find out!....👽but me, i hope that IS NOT the case... im just throwing that scenario out there, far out there lol...
I hope Santa Claus and his sleigh are not undertaking practice manoeuvres,, that is his area of origin !!!!!!it's a worry  !
Just something peaked my spidey sensors, How do we know what the pilots said? Still be an ongoing mission correct.
I wonder what data was collected by the F-29s? Now that the software and bugs are seemingly sorted with them the hhd on all 3 jets is who I'd like to hear;P
Aliens playing jokes
Carry on.  This is being reported by CNN.  I don't think they know how to tell the truth. Nothing to see here.
Fbi takes the lead,, to date nothing recovered
Look at this actor she's going to get a loggy ,is that how u spell it,who cares anyway ,it's all bull.... , they have already started with the fear, I know already where this is leading, it was the Flinstones behind it!! These people are planning something really bad and fake for next year, and they have the media to scale it up, the fear and paranoia.
Nd its 2 months later and not a word about what that was nor what they recovered hmmm.
Globalists press just deflecting attention away from East Palestine disaster.
You would
This analyst is very clueless or stupid. China does not fear or respect Joe Biden and these two clowns do not understand...they are laughable.
Uh, don't those planes have cameras?
I don't understand why their isn't any photos or videos of the object
It was def a ufo or uap.
Ask Natasha where is Boris Badinoff and the Moose and the Squirell? No offense just to make her laugh!
👽🖖🏼
Seems someone besides Us has these objects.
Something doesn't seem right with this report! They couldn't identify it, but yet they shot it down! So they were given the go ahead on shooting down something they clearly couldn't identify! Okay whatever!
Feeling out our defenses
This mentality shoot first and think later should be dropped in the protocol of intercepting flying crafts. So the F 35 apparently didn't have a cheap recording camera on board. Maybe because adding a $50 camera would push the cost of the plane too high.
Well where's the debris??????????
this interview was not worth of watching, doesn't matter if it was russia, china, aliens. What you show is confusion and bullshit mainly. Speculations. No matter what, this story is cut off just after starting. For people who like such 'information' is fine, for others it is disgusting and it is very low. Especially when a guy from cia appear and starts speaking about china, russia. Yeah, for sure one of them 😀 if not for sure aliens then ...Instead of allowing media participation in such actions ...  Media, do you still have any power anywhere, or your action is mainly sitting and listening to what they want you to say instead of being there ? Yeah, they would shoot you even because of thinking of being there just after shooting these objects. Speed of communication is in your case .. hmm. You can give public reliable information if you can be there at the same time, it is just so simple
They can tell by satellite what you had for breakfast this morning but not what they shot down ?
Of course they couldnt identify it they're flying at mach speeds. can you tell the expression a rabbits face has driving by it at 100 miles an hour?
"She"? You mean Xi (pronounced "Zgi"?
They have intevertantly started A war with extraterrestrials by shooting them down they are showing up in droves I see them all the time in Casa Grande Arizona here they are definitely not from here.
Imagine having a space radar and seeing a fleet of UFOs on path to reach earth.
Why has the media stopped talking about these objects?   They still bring up the balloon every chance they get but nothing about the other objects
When pilots say its a UFO its a UFO.. you think they don't understand what a balloon looks like you numpties...
Its weird that no pictures of the object are available.
They are here because they heard earth girls are easy...
This is Salomon, reincarnation of Horus, first king of Egypt king of the world. I AM A PSYCHIC.  This was Ahman Bahta and the KFC guy from Ancient Aliens timetraveling with Prophet Yahweh, AKA MSN messenger dater with Nellis Air Force Base and using balloons etc etc etc.
if its identifiable like chinese or something then shoot it down but if not then why are they shooting it down, if it is a UFO from another planet it can only lead who ever these are to assume we humans are hostile so who could blame them if a real war of the worlds came about we should be trying to contact them not shoot them down
I'd like to see this brought up during press briefings...like remember those things we shot down in February. Whatever happened to that???
Ignore what the pilots said. Let's listen to the ex-spook. He'll tell us the truth. 🙄
This is ww3 apocalypse is coming repent and belive in Jesus crist he is coming for his people
Hey why not go ask Lou Alizando thats on YT all the time, he still has his security clearance and he knows I am sure!  Lou just wanted out and now acts like he can't say anything even though he knows.  On top of that he's just out making a name for himself with his '5 observables' and really never says jack!! Pathetic!  I think he should just be 'the guy' with the balls to say the real truth.
So what did the camera on the Sidewinder show the missiles themselves have cameras
So,  they did get to the wreckage?  Thought they couldn't!
I am genuinely offended at the CIA guy’s comments and I’ve never said that about anyone’s comments before.   The former CIA geezer’s dictation is so full of tihs while his tone is dismissive and condescending. Look America, this is the type of Sunshine Krispy crackers who run tihs in Langley. So that it makes me genuinely angry. “China sent a spy balloon over because they want to provoke!”   Yeah, that makes sense that China, a country who is by no means dumb, wants to be reduced to dust since they’re not human or anything right? Give me a break. This CIA shill isn’t even shilling correctly. He phoned in this interview so poorly, I could hear a CIA intern typing his responses in the background while sniffing a pharmaceutical speedball that CNN gives all their guests. Brought to you by Pfizer.
It's Been A MONTH Now. No New Details?
Quit being so aggressive humans. 🤦🏼‍♀️ You are slowing down progress.
CNN joke.some of the stupidest people
We’re getting closer and closer to the truth
Flying horse ...  Deadhorse.
I'm sure we'll never hear the real truth about what was up there.  Probably more, "Weather ballons.
The word in the spy community is that the Chinese have figured out anti-gravity!
I find it hard to believe anything on CNN anymore and I'll be honestly surprised if they don't find a way to include Russia and just as I typed Russia they come through! China isn't a threat, our president is super tight with China and has been selling America to China for a while now.
So are the yanks the only ones who are allowed weather balloons, spy planes and spy satellites and weapons of  ass destruction,
Why am I just now hearing about this?????
One month later... is there an update on this ? 👀
Ufo is coming
I love how they so badly want to use the word "Threat" with EVERYTHING that has ANY remote connection to UFO's (ET's), after being pandered by Luis Elizondo's rhetoric. Then they try to backpedal and make excuses like "oh, oh nonono, we just mean 'threat' as in danger to flight safety". No dude. You NEVER say "threat" about a flock of seagulls over an airport. You NEVER say "threat" about a high turbulent storm seen on weather radar. You NEVER say "threat" about a kid flying kites by a runway.  "Threat" indicates and implies an intentional targeted potential act of hostility. They know this very well, and there's a reason they keep using this word over and over and over again. Typical american media brainwashing. Keep repeating the same key word to gradually taint the publics opinion, even if zero facts exist to back up the usage of said word (no UFO encounter in worldwide history has ever actively threathened or shot at any human aircraft or ground personell).
Nordstream distraction.

The Great Deception Fake Alien Invasion Proj' Bluebeam 👽
Any video?
It has started 😎..more and more will appear
They just casually swept this one under the rug 😂😂😂
Well hopefully it’s not alien, they won’t be happy or see us as friendly 😂 😂 😮
Stupid. Thinking it could be somebody far advanced than us, they now take on somebody who will see us as enemy.
Lmao. They don’t know what it was and can’t recover the wreckage???? 😂😂😂😂 k. I believe you.
Wow my comments have been disabled? Still no word of what going on with these in the news ?!?!?! Way to shut up the public guys 👍
They coming for us 😢 we tick tocking they busy figuring  how to dominate  us. 😮
👽 😊
Why would the FBI be involved with investigating this ? its a Military action it should fall under MI and Military scientific division
Why now suddenly government know do they exist 🤣🤣 if aliens on vacation why shot them down 2023 all countries want to go to war 🤣
Strange. Well, at least they shot it down...this time. We have no idea what 'Our Enemies' may be attempting to send over Alaska or, The CONUS. Alien? That's always possible.
Darth Vader is BACK!!! Traveling with a Klingon/Romulan Star Fighter, he is dispensing "covid-23" aerosols And, AND!!!!! PROBABLY GIVING KIM JONG UN, FREE RIDES! 🤣cnn😋🙄
Governments think they own the world. Aliens created it. Who are you rooting for?
5:18 what does, "shelved and figured out," meN?
Meh,  can't trust cnn.
And then few days ago they said the information and images are CLASSIFIED
So I know all the racist and republicans don’t believe in this stuff but on march 30th 2023 I witnessed and recorded something flying at a high rate of speed and changing directions rapidly unlike a plane why was I looking up at the time you may ask well this week there was a planetary parade  I also compared my video in my phone to a few other found online it’s the same shape shifting light flying and changing directions I do believe we should be concerned not afraid but this is definitely a serious issue forget the stigma
Spread fear, fear, fear, and Devide and Concur,  Loosh
FAKED UP, TO SCARE THE PUBLIC, MAKE THEM "BELIEVE" They are Under Threat, so they can FURTHER put Constraints on the Public, "TO PROTECT US"
Soon they will "Claim" we are having UFO invasions, B.S. so they can Lock down people even more, and spread Fear, Fear, Fear, because that's how they Control, through Fear
I'd rather aliens destroy the earth than go through another term under a democratic president.
No doubt Trump will claim they were 'visitors' en route from  Galaxy Far Far Away to get his advice on setting up a SpaceForce of their own. 😂🥴🥴😂. Or maybe they are very small aliens who totalled 11780 in number and who Trump secretly, by telepathy, turned into residents of Georgia and are back to claim their votes weren't counted and therefore demand a recount.  Biden of course knows this and therefore had them shot down. 🤔🤔🤔
They recovered the weather balloon with no problem 😅 nothing to see in Alaska just more weather balloons that jam radar and hover at 40 k feet
Blame it on Trump
Not much news about this. Cover up in real time.
UFO that is!
I love how two months later, we still have NO CLUE what those UAP/UFO’s were. SMH please help!
Where is the proof they shot down UFOs, nine out of ten they were Chinese balloons. Otherwise they would show us that UFOs. China probably sent hundreds of balloons over the US. Now that's the secret's out on UFOs, they'll blame everything on them.
Nothing but B.S media, would ya just shut up
Shoot first ask questions later. No wonder alien craft have vaporized and disabled hundreds of jet fighters over the years; killing them accordingly then covering up the excuse to relatives. Mantell is just one example. Now they wise up and just observe because they can't compete. Example tic tac. One day they are going to screw with the wrong craft and get the pentagon sent to another dimension; with all inhabitants. And everyone will applaud.
Im here 1 month later and nothing else has been said.
Stop shooting them down, you want these things fucking with us? No!
cnn ...... amerika's pravda.
It's ironic isn't it?  Decades and decades of stories about cover ups, alien autopsies, experimental aircraft etc all with the government and military saying nothing now suddenly according to them we've got ufos everywhere. "Look over there, look over there" and a lot of us are buying it hook, line and sinker. Misdirection at a level Slydini would be applauding.
I was probed by aliens, at least I think they were aliens, they had green tshirts on
I call this BS. JUST ANOTHER distraction as usual.
wheres the update?
I doubt they shot an et down. Not saying not possible  The media always runs with a story and misinformation  All for money...  Media is very annoying
My loyalty to our country makes me not want to say this aloud....Yet, it seems someone or something is testing American Air Readiness.....Protocols need to be upgraded and changed!
Bet the us government forgets to inform us of the debris
One month on…..if it was anything they could talk about, we’d know. The silence is deafening.
de costa...even aliens think he is a joke....the most famous journalist ( cough, cough) for pushing fake news or what he calls the absolute truth....his leaving cnn would improve viewer numbers
Roswell now, it's also Made in China?
Love how we still haven’t heard what these other two things were and still no pictures.
Lots of nonsense, to see what happens in 13 Km height I use a telescope sind not a Fighter Pilot
Just for once I wish there was just an answer!  But one gets more confused from what these unqualified people talk about! You have billions spent on defense and no one knows anything.  But if I send more than $600 Dollars on Venmo the government knows all!
soooo that was a month ago and now nobody is talking about it anymore lol
Losing their minds over balloons but UAP’s apparently aren’t newsworthy.
If this was an extraterrestrial device capable of intergalactic travel, the US military wouldn't be able to hunt and shoot it down.
Fake News.  Tell us about the Biden family million dollar take from the Communist Chinese. You are hiding real news.
Don't tell me No Film or Stills
Hmm I know ufo has a bad stigma but what if otherworldly being are among us? How long have they been here? Can we benefit from their technology? So many questions.
How can america be so contradictive. What all that was said is so full of contradiction. Talk about spying on you, but you spy on other countries, you say it must be china or whoever but its not, you all america, you say its a UFO, but why shoot it down and it crashing into millions pieces, and why not be showing the full close up off the materials that you recovered, hmmm. Sounds like looks like an orchestrated plan propaganda by america , is this an inclination of what america is capable of performing. Have they had this strategically planned and put into action, and this is a cover story for some other hidden sinister agenda, a ruse they love to exonorate. C'mon now people ain't that stupid, we know what they're up to, using this as away, as a tool for whatever,,,, whatever?
OMG...no visible method of propulsion? The device interfered with sensors? Notice as of 3/22/23 there is no further mention of this? Russia has threatened the use of nuclear weapons and the aliens, whoever they are have made it clear that they would not allow them to be used . I have a theory:  There was massive data and radio signal interception by an alien probe. Alaska is the PERFECT place to put such a surveillance drone. It was so busy collecting signals intelligence it did not see the F35's coming and got shot down. THEY WILL NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN! They will shoot down any military aircraft that approaches one the next time around. I've suspected that Putin's threats could produce a result like this, and if he fires one they may attack and destroy Russia's nuclear arsenal in mere seconds! Now that the USA has shot one down the response to our intercepting fighter jets may be quite hostile if more are tried to be intercepted! No word from our government on the debris found because I'll betcha it IS alien!
Nothing compare to what US army recover many times on Puerto Rico, those are real Alien vehicles.  That's why it's the only island to be part of EEUU government.
Bulletin put out “if cruising on earth, verify cloaking device is functional”
They didn't shoot down a damn thing. Straight up lying. Where's the proof? Why say anything at all? So tired of the bullshit. Put up or shut up already.
chill when aliens land they won't know they cought covid from us
It’s also possible that the generic explanation they gave is the truth. (I know I know) crazy concept but maybe it was just a large balloon that got caught up by the changing jet stream and taken far away from the expected trajectory. That can happen.
Cover up news forming a narrative to spin to you and me God is coming to get us
Antigravity. USA made them years ago. 0 signs of propulsion. Defies the laws of physics. There unmanned, like a drone. Lmao. They were made HERE! There is no gravity in space.
YES,  THE JET'S ARE VERY FAST,  THEY ALSO HAVE BRAKING CAPABILITY'S,    IF REQUIRED.  SATT.
Look up in the night sky for at least 15 min lay on your back on the ground . It a every day t occurrence
They say they found wreckage and CNN was waiting for information... All of a sudden they change that story line to "they couldn't find the wreckage"!!! Now, they killed the story completely... Nothing to see here folks, just keep on moving!!!
Notice this doesn't appear on the new anymore at all
I smell bull shit !
So a month later it has fallen completely off the radar. See what I did there? WTF was it?
Too many people on the planet - that's the problem. Maybe it's not difficult enough for this day's work & going forward as certain 'bully' Nations: US, Russia, china- playing secret germ warfare w/china more concerned about the image than the reality.  I went shopping y'day and I proudly left w/o ANYTHING w/'made in china,'  'product of china' on a single item. The Nation that breaks out of the protocol for lab containment policies because they may ' lose "face" ', has lost much more.
I wonder if it is used as a radar bouncing object
Wake up Buddy, No way the Chinese or Russians have this level of technology!
Even if they recover reckage they will tell the public sod all!
Mach 6, 🤷🏼‍♂️ nothing we have can go that speed. Got to be a UAP.
all i hear is blah blah blah need more military spending sheeple give us money
Watch Joe Rogan with bob lazar
No propulsion?Really,what a mystery that a balloon has no propulsion.idiots.
It’s been a month. What was it
It's time for them to invade humanity because our time is at hand. Many have fallen away, and the four corners are open. Open doors to their realm has been done just wait for the one to come!
Mexican Alien, South American Alien 👽 Outer space Aliens. It's just a bad time to be any kinda of Alien.
It was a hobby balloon.  School reported it.  Shot a 12 dollar hobby balloon down with a million dollar missile.  These fools are pathetic
I'm relieved the timeline shows that the prez was advised.  That's a good thing so that the admin can work on a statement that blames President Trump.
CIA + CNN = Father&Son
It’s wild how this is not even being talked about like that anymore smh , government gets away with another one. Prolong your attention span human race!
man , you have to love  an opinion piece being passed off as news without source citing..so who can say if its true reporting..or hyateria creating for ratings..take all this with 40lbs of salt
40 places.. pause .. He shouldn't have let that info out 😅
FBI takes the lead 🤦
Don’t want even listen crap government pollute the air! Just saying BS! Wondering is there anyone believing in it ?
these people really think viewers are stupids, with that redirection from unidentified object, with not regular propultion and the size of a car, to the Chinese ballons and thought of war games... Really?
LMAO you people didn't buy into the Alien BS now did you
Why now? The existence of UFOs and extraterrestrials has been talked about by people for YEARS, but never on the MSM. So....why now? All of a sudden, its being looped and in and broadcast in the spotlight. Similar to the covid fear mongering, and the relentless vaccine push. Now Aliens. 😂😂
Why couldn't it be a dry run for EMF attack
What about the occupants? Why is there no mentioning of occupants or whether they survived?
Why have the US government changed their stance on UFOs? Denial, denial, denial since 1947 and now they are putting videos out there like this one and the tictac+ gimbal videos! What does it all mean???
If they recovered some debris and still say they don’t know what it is, it’s not a balloon…
Sounds like project Blue beam.
Poor ET 👽 became collateral damage and got caught up in a pissing contest between USA and China.
Its crazy how some people just brush stuff like this aside while showing intense interest in the latest news of Meghan Markle or the goings-on in Tiktok.Most people just take the balloon theory thrown at us and brush this off.The objects were probably just used car dealer balloons that drifted away.You know those big balloons with very long arms that flail their arms about from the wind being blown up their asses.That was reported on the news at one point!  The object interfering with the planes sensors reported by some pilots but not others.The pilots saying they had no idea how these 3 objects were staying afloat and the way that the DOD was calling them objects.How hard is it to ascertain if an object is a balloon? Then no wreckage ever recovered and we are told after 5 days that the government has given up locating the 3 wreckage's.  The kicker for me though is that while we have been given multiple pictures of the Chinese spy balloon there is not one picture of the 3 objects shot down.You know....the car sized object shot down Feb. 10th. The cylinder-shaped object shot down Feb. 11th and then the eight-sided object shot down Feb. 12th.Why no pictures posted?  I am not saying aliens here but WTF why all this weird stuff.Show us the pictures from the jets circling the object...one for a full day before it was shot down.
hard to believe that people actually believe this bullshit of any big media for that matter. Infos all scripted and misdirection.
Saying a whole lot of nothing over something that no-one has even seen.  No documents, no photos, no video footage, no official response, no independent investigation from journalists.  Just shooting the shit.  You people should be ashamed of yourselves.
what does this have to do with Silicon Valley s stock plummet
It is ETE
They shot it down. I doubt it. What's the angle here.  But if they did, why ! DIOTS!!
And here we are weeks later, with all of the debris recovered. And a top-secret blanket over it, with zero further information released to the public.
CNNNEWS.
Keep pointing to other countries as we all know this is off world UFOs
I loved that frisbee, thanks a lot!
Strange that these so called advance ufos are letting them self's get shot out the sky.
Fake news
So the project blue beam is hereby initiated so no one would be judge in the tribunaal, so that the agenda will change, so that civilians will only worry about their lives, to suppress the crimes against humans.
Why do humans always choose violence first at the sight of the unknown?
CNN..... are you sure this is accurate  ???  FAKE NEWS ..
My opinion it’s to draw our attention away from what is going on with the new no good party in the White House.
Could you imagine what the aliens would think when they said take us to your leader. And they get brought to Sleepy Joe Biden. We wouldn't only be the laughingstock of the world we would be the laughingstock of the universe
It's all bull shat, come on people it's disinformation to hide something else
The object projected to the pilots mind what they wanted to
Ufo 😭
The fact that we aren’t hearing anything about the contents inside of these aircraft tells me there’s something deep going on. And they don’t want people panicking about it. I think China is trying to feel out the air space with drones before sending manned aircraft to attack the US. I don’t think aliens are here right now of all times.
The fist stages of a alien take over 😂 I’m laughing to keep from crying 👀
I know what it is.
When the most technologically advanced military in the world can’t identify the technology used on a Unidentified Flying Object….got to brush up on some old invasion movies to make sure I’m ready 🥷🔭 🕳️🕳️ 🕳️ 🕳️🕳️ 🕳️🔥
What if it was not Chinese Balloons like they claimed but an Alien Cover Up? Eventually Biden will release that video Claiming it was Aliens to push a False Narrative.
For anyone wondering, the US called off the search for the wreckage about 3 days after it was shot down, stating the weather conditions made the search too difficult. Definitely suspicious. Makes you wonder if they found something they don't want to disclose. But if theyre telling us the truth and we truly can't get to it, why the fuck did we shoot it down over somewhere we can't recover it...
CNN is the only station that would believe tgat a US f35 or ANY ...WOULD B ABLE TO SHOOT DOWN AN ET VEHICLE....LMAO gtfoh
How much money do yall spend on views? 😅😅😅😅😅😅
A load of crap 💩
Like there going tell us the truth
Whatever they are they can die with our weapons systems obviously
Now the three (3) objects have been pushed under the carpet.. the media has gone silent. It is worth noting Biden said China and Russia weren't involved.
Anyone got a link that shows pictures of the object??
If we can shoot them down, how are they alien spacecraft?
Your so called expert "Robert Baer" is a phoney who knows NOTHING as he just drops buzzwords that don't even make sense eg:  1) "frequency hopping" ...what's that got to do with anything!  2) "Obviously it's got a propulsion system" ...what an "expert" observation Einstein! 😵‍💫 Geez if you're going to get an expert opinion on something at least get someone who actually knows something!
Aliens
These were nothing more than Chinese and civilian made balloons. There is no fighter jet in the world that could shoot down a ufo the beings inside ufos can read minds they would know to move out of the way from any missile before it was even launched. Look at the incident with the USS Nimitz when the ufos flew around showing off in front of the US jets and then took off at 24 thousand MPH  leaving them in there dust the pilots of the fighter jets went to there rally point and the ufos were there waiting. Only the pilots knew where the rally point was and yet there they were!
Funny how this was 3 weeks ago and it's just been forgotten no update have been  made on this
They Got Images Of The 🎈Balloon🎈  Being Shot Down But Where's The Footage Of The OTHER 👽MYSTERIOUS Objects👽  That Were Shot Down, Huh???🤔👽👽👽👌🏾💯
Errrr, sorry hoomans. The fighters did not see the “L” plate or learned plate on the back of our space craft. We normally only alow numbers to fly at high alts due to the heavy traffic you hood are flying around. SORRY! OOPS! Shazbot 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Fake news.    Everything that comes from CNN is lies.
Look up Project Blue Book.  Mass psychosis at its finest.
Mach 6 WTF??? That’s one fast wiener dog!!! 😂4 sure
U F O ! There I said it! Was that so hard Washington??? Come on!!!
This object is probably a Chinese dirigible with no external means of propulsion.
CNN=Communist News Network
So they could identify where it was, how to shoot it down, but where the debris is, contents are made of, or orgins.  Still remains a mystery. Maybe with some more military funding they can answer that.
Pilots don't discuss their missions.
I didn't know my son's birthday balloons went that far.
I wish they would describe what it looked like, details, round, square, oblong, what color, lights ????
Is it true that balloon #1 was a weather balloon and the rest were literally hobbyist balloons? Kind of suspicious that such a bombshell story just kind of disappeared 🤔
Book says wicked be Very scared the King Has turned loose The very Demon on all corupted not even Satan is Above GOD  there is no  more sacrifice they who come aagainst his Creation is better to have a Stone Hung round your Neck for what He will do Eternally to fallen Demons for all to see  so shall Reap in their end of Time foolish Media all will see the fall....
Thank God we now know that frozen water is called ice. Who says you can't learn something new on CNN. Somebody bring Kamala up to speed on this frozen water thing.
Watching this 3 weeks later, has the wreckage been found and analysed now?
Y would thy use ballones when thy could satilignts
These are all satanic objects. Satan is mad at the  world. Deception.  Satan knows his end is near.
Is this the same CIA guy who was hunting Hitler?
This one will be hard to spin convincingly 👽🛸
😂😂😂😂
The pilots are like I think ET gave me the finger 😂
in 1993 i saw a object cigar shaped and 59 more people saw this later. i feel privileged to know that we on earth are debating this subject now when I know the truth
I think it was balloon, but who knows. Actually hope we have some kind of alien intervention cause humans are so toxic and destructive with the threat of nuclear war, hoping a smarter species will stop that. I'm sure they're watching us closely.
They didn’t blame white people for problems of non-whites, that’s insane.
China Russia Swampgass YaYaYa
Hmmmmm. Who knows what to think...?
Our technology has come so far in 100 years I don't think we could shoot aliens down who are 1000s or probably millions of years ahead of us the government's just getting in our heads.
Aliens lives matter
So they just can't figure out what a $4 weather balloon is, even FBI are flabbergasted.
They are trying to poison us.
The Aliens has already been taking over millions of people bodies.
They govt know what it is because the space station see's everything they are lieing to public. UFO's are real
Can we believe you?
Fluff piece with nothing but speculation.
FAKE NEWS JIM WITH THE FAKE NEWS NETWORK, BRAVO SIR... BRAVO!!!
Het was Venus
I pity the fool who has any confidence in the FBI at this time...  The American people will never know the truth!
The Black Triangle is in Alaska along with many Ufo sightings by the people ,heard they have a base there,the Gov. will just continue to cover up & say its a balloon & not a Ufo,Im sure 1 or 2 might be BUT not all are, they will try their strategy to shut this down
I LOVE how their slowly telling everyone their here!
It is ludicrous to be looking for ETs and sending signals to them, and then when they come to visit, to start shooting at them. This is nuts, in my opinion. And no they don't present any threat to civilian craft, they know how to maneuver around. You don't suppose they know how to navigate through the worm holes but would not be able to maneuver safely around civilian and military craft, without colliding? Yeah, I don't buy into it.
If it wasn't CNN, I might believe it. "Then why are you on this thread?" Question is why is CNN popping up in my Suggestions.
The Great Balloon Panic has only made hobbyists stronger.
It's funny how they shot down 3 UFOs right after the Chinese balloon and now's all swept under the rug.
You say the fbi,cia,etc are examining these things.. do we actually trust them to tell us what they really are? I dont...
I'm ready I am ready for them to come make contact peaceful tho lol but we need something to distract us from the other things going on🤷‍♂️
Everybody needs to just chill! They are just here to pick me up......
It's pretty funny how much the govt publicized the few balloons they were tracking and shot down. If there were more than those two, we would have announced it, so whoever launched them must be getting their LOLZ at how many we DIDN'T find.
With all the high-resolution camera technology we have on this planet, it makes perfect sense that we don't have a visual record of the object and that our first reaction was to destroy it. Pretty dumb.
we will never know! host is pretty!
We know the first one was a balloon. What about the one over the lake?
https://youtu.be/j_rN1pQm4ic
Cuz we got hit by one of these things an has enough tech to fly better then anything we have built but yet they are a hazard?
Any more information about this now (3/8)?
Note: I have live on the coast of SC my ENTIRE life and NEVER have I seen the ocean freeze there. That happens somewhere else, but not here. It's not been cold enough to freeze moving water. Pools weren't even frozen.  THAT part was a bold faced lie.
They know exactly what.👁🔺️
Shoot first...... Ask questions later..... ?????
What shape was this object of much interest
I'AM on ground evaluation.
Space War.
Not here to murder people.
I litterally got 2,534 Dead since yesterday on USA Lands. Mexican terrorists.
They use different Slurs.
I already said it.
It is Mexico the war Iraqi freedom.
When you stop asking the CIA and the FBI about stories like this….you will be better off.
CNN the real fake news!!
Make them use they weapons them 🙏🏾
BS
I believe in extraterrestrial life That possess a higher intelligence and or technology then humans have(they are able to travel to our world & we don't ha e the tec to travel to theirs. But I don't believe they would come all the way to earth & get shot down by us!😳
So uuuhhhh we gonna hear anymore about this?
Sounds like another balloon.
Clowns.
Aliens come to earth to watch,"The Galaxies funniest home videos "
Curiously misinformation is sadly one of the many things we have to face in the modern 21st Century, which is actually quite depressing as there is no need for it. The Pentagon,  will say its of National Security, but they have already embarrassed themselves with recent revelations that they had to recalibrate N.O.R.A.D.'s Radar to even pick theses up. So once again the Pentagon remains asleep at the wheel.  The F.B.I frankly is not any further with knowing "Who is responsible" again you have to wonder if they just twiddle their thumbs every day, and actually do any work.  What was an interesting statement made at the very beginning of all this was when it was said that they didn't know if this was a "Corporate" company, or an individual, or any of the other usual suspects.   So then what you can gather is that a "Corporate" company is showing off it's latest toy, then clearly it has got the advantage, and the F.B.I. will not have a scooby doo, about the technology that allows it to function. This isn't E.T. as E.T. doesn't need to impress us anymore. Is the reality
The U.S. is starting a War with Aliens, my Alien 👽 friends are gonna get piss Off.
All I hear is Chinese, Chinese, Chinese…  At the same time; it’s nearly impossible to get inside these circles? Why would they do this? Are they trying to provoke us? Provoke, Provoke, Russia, china, china….  The US is out for blood again, mark my words; next war is incoming :(
Poor ALF
Theeey're heeeere...
3 Weeks ago. I wish they'd put update links in at the end.
Our governments have got out of control
Don't believe anything from CNN
why would china or russia send balloons to spy when they have orbital spy satelites come on america wake up its another red herring to try and fool everybody when their is types of craft that can fly in space then in the air and finaly travel in our oceans
Strange stuff in the sky new Mexico    https://youtu.be/lKfzhv4z_hE
There must have been two objects ==================================
I though I saw a spacecraft at first sir ! I turned out to just be a floater in my eye sir !

Jesus loves you, repent now before it’s too late!!
I hope they are Aliens with  3 vaginas!
part of the indoctrination programme as Bob Oechsler said
China is full of Hot Air.
I see now why CNN's ratings are tanking. I've never heard so much talking with so little said.  Good grief.  I want my time back.
BS
Your chart shows the "object" at 40,000 feet, and an airliner at 30,000 feet, creating the false impression that there was such a margin of safety. Just a few days ago, I flew with Air Canada from Tokyo to Vancouver, coming close to Anchorage, at 39,000 feet.
Dominance posturing -- whose balloon is the biggest? China's demonstrated bio-warfare capability or US nuclear superiority,  both now flagrantly billboarded.... The Globalist Barbershop: "How's it going, Fred?"  "Hey, Jimmy -- just trim a couple of billion off the the back and sides."
Spy balloons???  We estimated that China has about 100 spy satillites surrounding the earth. They have the same system as google earth and their own gps system. Where is the proof before we call it spy balloon.
Sy
If a legit UFO made it here, we ain't shooting it down lol. Stop the cap!
East vs West … coming soon 🔜  Stay Safe.
Its 2023, we did level pandemic, now its alien level 😂 just zombies, and then Asteroid then we done with the game
No Alien n UFO hoax only.. They fool us
This could be bad if they decided to attack back or if their trying to help us😮
It's CHINA spying on us they want you to think it's aliens yeah all of a sudden when a American citizen sees china spying on us we shoot it down but the other ballons were aliens yeah right lol biden is a LIAR he is selling us out what's it gonna take for us to accept the obvious that CNN is lying to you
Those Great Lakes are a Hot Spot for "UAP" aka "UFO's". I know they have bases located down on the lakes bottom. If you recall, they are vessels in which can traverse in a "Trans-medium" <? Mode of travel. Meaning it can traverse through air, and or below water, hence the shag Harbor term "USO" unidentified submerged object" just my hypothesis!? 🤔
China has been flying these things over the USA for a while now. What has changed now is our doctrine regarding how to handle these things given the current geopolitical climate. And of course MSM sounding the alarm for views. IT's the stuff we dont know about that is scary. This is probably just some sort of distraction.
The man made a comment of a balloon going Mack 6 and the government had yo shelve it because they couldn't figure it out. Ahh a balloon isn't going to go Mack 6 and if the government couldn't figure it out then don't call it a balloon because it's not a balloon.
I have 0 confidence that the US government will tell us the truth on this
When a spy ballon came, we didn’t know what to do. When flying objects came, we didn’t know what we shoot.
Cmoon wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, lets wait for the guy that tells everyone no need to worry it was just a familiar explained object,  meanwhile other countries bluntly straight up told their people there was UFO that they chased down lol while we filter all our news, still!?🤦🏻‍♂️ cmon
A beak, wings and they found a strange egg shaped object in the body. Life is now like the muppet show in the US.
So the pilot of an F35 doesn't know how balloons stay in the air? Really ?
Aliens my buttocks... just an excuse for more military spending
Project blue beam in stage 1
In all of these accounts no one has ever said that the objects were hostile and yet they are still pushing the  story it being a security risk
So far last I heard was besides the Chinese balloon recovery. The other 3 objects were unable to be recovered. Which I find hard to believe. Also the jets are equipped with cameras, and I certainly assume some pretty high quality cameras. So that is obviously not being shared with the public. Next, the balloon was certainly shot down with a air to air missile. As we were told the other 3 objects were as well. Unless the F35 is without a machine gun or canon type gun. Why are we shooting down these objects with a missile that costs God knows how much money and would do significant damage to the objects. When we could probably bring them down with a short gunfire blast and less damage to gain more information? It's sort of like killing a fly with a sledge hammer... Last I heard the 3 unknown objects were the size of a car...
It was actually a balloon that looked like a woman, but no one knew how to describe it
What is bullshit is all modern fighter jets (And especially the F-35) have digital recording cameras which capture targeting of the plain and much more. This means there is freaking video of this object which the government is not releasing. There is no viable national   security interest or threat satisfied by keeping that video from the public! Quite frankly as much fucking taxes as get taken out of my paycheck every two weeks I (And you as well) have literally paid for that video, and I want to see the finished product!!!! The   government has no right to keep any possible alien contact from the public at large. Despite what it tends to believe, the United States Government does not speak for all of mankind! Plus, education of the public about any possible visitors strategically is the best   defense and strategy so aliens can not trick those in the general public who may believe encounters with such entities and technology are not Jesus second coming, magic, or some other thing from which those humans could be placed in danger due to a lack of   realization that they are witnessing or interacting with possible visitors from another planet (Possibly hostile) and advanced technology! Not magic, the Will of God, or other more =easily manipulative states of believing being ascribed to what people may   witness or experience. Education alone fights fear and irrational behaviors and reaction to new experiences! Therefore, the government does the citizenry a great dis-service keeping from the public all it may or may not know about such incidents!
I'm surprised Jim didn't I this into President Trump and January 6th some how. BNN you are a bunch of clowns you are irrelevant
Oh please DOD knows what these are . Listen to the pilots for decades
There not aliens! Demons are flying around. Please do not forget the gospel

Another push for a new agenda, Space Force? Come on if 👽 aliens wanted to invade the earth there isn't a damd thing in the arsenal to keep them from annihilating humans or anything else for that matter. 🤔
Aliens are the actual creator's of the world and they know we have gone wild 😜
So what you’re saying is with all bullshit aside “we have no idea”
Coincidence the object acts like our North America "actor" leaders; nobody knows what they are, what direction they're going, and are they real.
I'm almost positive none what they said in this video those pilots never said anything
Project blue beam. Beginning of the New World Order
Bob Baer...cool.  Nazi Hunter in Chief....
They said f35 then the print said f22.  So they document like 5yr Olds off get go.  🙄  maybe baby alien in Kmart car ....now mothership coming to vaporize bad ants on planet
Aliens been here forever humans attack they dont
Oh well probable first contact and they get shot down in the fecking freezer. I wonder when there mates will be back to finish us all off well done norad
Our cosmic travel rating is dropping fast. Our alien tourists are going to treat our planet like Detroit from now on and pass on by while keeping a close eye on the rear view
Look over there ! Further !
Pieces of the Mothership
Maybe china is looking for blind spots ,if theses balloons make it pass all detection .
And just like that, no one is talking about the UAP's anymore🤔
Lol  . if this was an E.T. OPERATED  craft     A standard fighter plane could not have taken it down .    🛑 This is it people. 🛑. 👉🛑  THE FEAR PROGRAM  HAS BEGUN 🛑👈 .  Just as  Eisenhower Said on his deathbed 🛑  👉😱 it would  begin The start of the   MAN made   False Flag  event  🤔🤦🏻‍♀️  ….UFO TECHNOLOGY’S BEING STAGED. ….to justify a global collaboration  😉  the shock required to bring us together against a common enemy . 🤔😉  .  Just like the binladen  chemical weapons. That never happened . 🤦🏻‍♀️💰💰💰  sheeple .  ….we are about to loose what little remains of our freedom’s as individuals .
This is just getting halarious...😆. Another balloon 🎈 shot down?? Sounds like a visual assessment of the UFO like Arnold did in 1947... 👽
So you can tell there was no camera's on it but can't see what it is lol I hate when they say stupid shit
Its the biggest open secret ever. Aliens are real. Aliens are here, and they dont care about us.
It will come out again no its a "weather balloon" yer
Did they ever say what it was?  Is it just me or did this whole story just stop being reported poof just like that.   M
Rubbish
Is Biden an alien... ?
Lol, keep hammering on the “china” story, keep the attention away from other scenarios
Lmfao!!!!😂😂 “well, pilots flying the F-35 are flying very fast, so it’s no wonder they all had conflicting reports” my ass .. there’s a neat thing called a throttle that makes you go not so fast lol, that and the fact that the 400,000$ helmet F-35 pilots wear makes them able to see through the plane itself .. typical US government trying to cover their ass and downplay the situation lmao😂🤦‍♂️👍
‘Merged’ podcast on you tube.  Lieutenant Ryan graves real research
CNN sucks
BS
Funny how the government is putting all this info about UFOs out while we have one of the most corrupt presidents in history.
Democrats probably already trying to figure out how to tax them.
Ummm why shoot them down, if you think ww3 on earth is something, if you piss off the aliens it will be ZAP and we ALL lose
Liars. Project blue beam. Research eric dubay.
Pity we won't get to hear about what the debris is. They'll just make a smoke and mirrors story up. No one would use a $380,000 missile from a 200 million dollar fighter jet, to shoot a balloon.
Sad the we will never hear the truth
I hope we didn’t just blow a peaceful alien delegation out of the sky.
pushing the narrative lmao
A balloon that is going Mach 6? Come on! They must think people are stupid
Come to earth get shot. 👍
This gives me chills
🐇don’t let em near🖕🏾
Jim the Commie Acosta
Wtf cares  really
The balloons are joint program of china America and several others countries to study the Atmospherethe stuff was recoverd it had  American made parts.what a joke Wake up people.
Lol
Funny there was never a back up story on these events.
Bob Lazar deserves an apology he will never get
Its them alien coming in 😭🤣 they took to they lab to analyze it 🤣
And maybe people  won't notice the Ukraine failure, the US attack on  NS2 ... let's find UFOs or ghosts,  or whatever helps The American people ignore reality.
cnn just sits here literally lying to your face in real time. we don't know what they are. also: they're all chinese balloons. OHHHH. OK
Imagine is a kids drone
Admission to the Earth Zoo has had a change of management
For anyone thinking this is Aliens, let’s think about it.  A civilization has technology advance enough for space travel, probably interstellar space travel, and with all this you honestly think our jets would be able to shoot it down.
Please, tell me they didn't shoot down the U.S.S. Enterprise...!
Lol. Isnt it nice the military is letting their soldiers speak freely.  So suspect.
I'm more scared of certain people than what I am of aliens. Why tf would they want or need anything from us or our planet anyway? Lol
Does anyone actually think that we would hear comments from what pilots saw? Do you know how many reports like this were immediately classified but all of a sudden it’s front page news? Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight?!?!?!?   I call huge amounts of BS
For year they have said the objects moved at incredible speeds. So fast our jets couldn’t keep up. Now all of a sudden we can shoot one down. They got a conspiracy all over it.
Great acting
$12 Balloon  !
Blah blah blah . Propaganda. Soviet Union and joseph stalin all over again. CNN is in on it . Nice try
A lot of balloons do not have a "propulsion system" they simply drift with the wind.  If you want your balloon to drift in a particular direction, you pump gas in or out of the envelope to move the balloon up or down to where the wind is blowing in the direction you want it to go. Balloons with a "propulsion system" are usually called "Dirigibles". For example the Goodyear Blimp.
So why shoot it down? You don't know what it is so you shoot it down wierd
YEYE YE ANOTHER DISTRACTION COULD IT BE OUR INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATIONS AYE SAY IT AGAIN SPACE STATIONS MORE THAN ONE UP THERE HENCE NEVER A CLEAR DAY J6ST SAYING WE RED TAILS IN OUR SKYS AT NIGHT FACT 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🤣👆🤫
If this is coming from China it don like we need to return the favor !!!!  I will not trust the fbi with anything !!!!!
"Just go down the rabbit 🐰 🕳️ here If these "UFO/UAP " are from out of this world 🌎 then I 🤔💬 it's a global"problem "&we all need to work together obviously really right work towards a common goal and figure this things out plus shooting at them I know there in our bubble 💭 but ummm 🤔 🧐
So my question is if they don’t have any idea what it is how do they know is coming from china unless it has a tag that says made in china 🤷‍♂️
From what I just commented, she just proved a point right there the lady just said China, spy, balloon, and then corrected herself and stated can’t state that because we don’t know what it is. She just contradicted herself and put her self out there and the government out there as liars.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
But yet Joe Biden is still going after China for all three objects even though they’re not helium balloons like he even states, they are UFOs??? They’re changing the story just to get us to believe it.
Oh they’re up to something….(ALL THE TIME)
Any updates on this?
Whole thing was bogus,like WMDs in Iraq...it diverts attention from real issues like Northsrream 2!
We need to build a wall to keep out the aliens!!
Thing About the internet is every crazy person has an opinion. So the truth gets lost on here. It was probably another country trying to provoke or gain some intelligence
Its Hologram technology to trick the population into a one world government through an Aliens invasion  Stop falling for this shit
Priceless..now we saying that ufo 🛸 are really now...in the past they would  shoot it down  an say that they are not real..I GUEST ARENA 51 IS REAL NOW 😂🤣😂🤣😂

It's all bullshit
Greetings, earthlings.
Can we trust this news and media maybe they r even being lied to 🤷‍♀️
If it Quacks like a duck. If it Looks like a duck. If it Behaves like a duck. Then GUESS WHAT?  It's a UFO dammit! 🛸 By the "framing of this piece", one must only conclude that these two gentlemen have been put to the task of making sure they drop certain keywords into the mix...like "China or Russia" for example. Fact is folks, the FAKE ALIEN INVASION card is now on the table. And "they" better not look away, cuz i'm takin' one of those crafts.
Can’t believe the pentagon is t expecting the public to believe they haven’t recovered the objects yet and have just LEFT THEM LAYING WHERE THEY FELL! How the hell do they expect us to believe that??
The CIA dude added nothing to the conversation. I guess there were no retired fighter pilots who could join in, eh.
It’s Hijacked Aurora Plane,from Area 51,commited by Isis fugitive swine pig Monica Elfriede Witt.
Geo mapping genius, and u know it's not Russia.
🛩....🚀🎈  🎈🤡🌎🎈
Why do UFOs only spying on the US ???
Does anyone know the background song at the beginning? CNN always adds catchy songs lol
So, no one has seen the series,  project blue book.  Thus has happened  before , it's not the first time,  pilots can't remember what they saw , the had different experience being  in thr same air space and had a calmer experience.   So, let's say the spaceship had advanced civilization and are not aliens. Why are we so in a mood to bring it down when what if they were sent here to talk  to earth humans. Or to see if it's  necessary to be in the earth's airspace.   To all the Christians people,  what if it was Jesus coming through again. Lol.   Let's say it was a starship,  why are people so scared , are people that brainwashed to be so uneasy to see or get news that a ufo had made it to earth.  Again. I didn't see the ufo do anything but fly to low.    Let's hope it's not a drone that someone wanted to get fame.  I rather aliens or another advanced race here then trump back in the White House , keep a loser in his golf course that he doesn't use because out taxpayers' money isn't on the bill.
Alien invasion
What an alien is that, traveling from an altitude of 80,000 ft down to sea surface for just seconds... and was easily shot down? Was that a test of human cruelty level?
Where's the actual footage
You just can't believe what cnn or the democratic party members sayso it wasn't a balloon,Oh president Biden said don't worry about it ,it's nothing But after they look at it you should be able to tell if it's outer worldly
Fools!  The crab people are coming.
What really happened is that when they looked at the bizarre aircraft the pilot noticed they were green looking lizard folks with Universal Studios T-shirts on give me the middle finger and that’s why they shut it down
The aliens will come attack us at any time or  IT'S ALL B.S. JUST TO MAKE US AFRAID OF      EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING AND EVERYPLACE
Stop the capp 🤣 it's a party balloon from PARTY CITY (balloon shop) they tied a gps tracker device and it flew over Alaska and lost track on the same day the fighter jet shot down the balloon over Alaska. Regarding the interference of the jets equipments, that's because they build a jet using parts bought on eBay😂
Make sure you get the fat woman in every photo op there agenda.
💎💝💚💖
If you’re an alien cruising around/near earth, be careful out there. Our governments and militaries are very mentally unstable. ✌️
Nope.
Damn now I can’t go back to my planet. Stuck on earth with humans that are still dealing with racism in 2023
That's BS the old man trying to  belittle the Pilots . The know what they  seen and how the airplane acted.   Unlike the biden administration  there still  professionals and believe in protecting our country the United States of America.  Old fart needs  go lay down take a nap PERIOD
Chances are good that it was made in China, as most things like balloons are. Almost everything is made in China. It does make me forget about the Biden family business dealings, selling influence to foreign countries like China.👽🛸🎈
They're hiding the fact that it was a bomb that was floating in the air being remote-controlled they're trying to blame me that it's a alien craft or something it's a lie and we thinking thank Joe Biden for this bullshit for allowing that balloon to stay up in the air for so long we all know he's bought and paid for by China him and his son may God be with us all
Doesn’t make sense that the government would wanna shoot this thing down and destroy parts of it. Why wouldn’t they wanna get it down in one piece? Everything is fishy about this
If this was some kind of UFO or something as interesting as their trying to make it seem, we certainly wouldn't be hearing about it on the news,
Distraction

Why blow up an item to piece it back together to investigate it, when you can tow it intact
CNN needs to get better at reading between the lines. The CIA guy mentioned an object traveling at mach 6. No way in Hell can a Chinese or Russian device achieve that unless it is a rocket. When I was a military cadet several of us watched a solid craft hovering over the messhall. As it was 1967 I seriously doubt that it was built by Boeing or Lockheed! I would suggest the people at CNN read about the DIA's two year investigation up at the Skinwalker Ranch in Utah. If anyone thinks NORAD can, in most cases, protect the airspace of this country you had best think again. Hint: almost every star that has been examined has a planetary system. Use your heads people and cut the crap!
The first island above the Russian mainland coming from Alsaks is a military base

stop buying from china
Are we supposed to believe this nonsense, it's nothing but a distraction from the corruption by Western Governments. Truthful news on Redacted.
Might be about time our governments give us a hint on what is really going on so we can take precautionary measures as we see fit 🤷. Civilians now have the technology, can’t hide much from us anymore 🤔🧐.
.
Call them Chinese balloons, shoot them down, then blame China for the fallout.
Fake alien invasion to come soon. Move from US my people

No government has the right to withhold any information from it’s citizens for any reasons at all,unless they’re under the impression that they are better and more patriotic that the the people they voted for them,withhold the information from the people is the act of felony !
Yeah!  Brandon shoot down a $20 hobby lobby 🎈 balloon  with a $200 millions F 22 and a $  400k. Missile!!  🤣🤣🤣🤣  He is my competent in chief!!
Mid 50 and early 60 on the ranch in the mountains my father advice was if you see something that doesn't seem like it belongs here. Keep your mouth shut because people will think you are crazy. It don't matter if it follows you overhead and stops your car for awhile. Keep quiet.
Hey look !! There are aliens nevermind our degrading economy but yes aliens!
it's a UFO!!!!!!! THETE GETTING READY TO attack people. it's time to move out to the country build yourself a tall tower where you can see him coming it's time to get out of the city people move start hunkering down build those bunkers build those bomb shelters start stacking up on food they make you think that our systems really strong but really it's like a balloon people these people can attack it anytime multiple different people from North Korea to Russia to aliens the whole thing's a shitshow. my thoughts and prayers with you all to any God that will listen somebody's got to save us.
How is dude bringing up COVID in this?!?
I think that if it's some type of testing equipment (or surveillance) either Russian or Chinese .... and they failed to notify the US/Canada, ..study it closely and, when finished, incinerate it and send it back by FEDEX or UPS to the source  it came from ....charges due.
Im pretty sure if it was UFO's it would be like throwing a rock at a tank
They said... "this is stupid...  great distraction from bidens failures though"   CNN will have some Great propaganda
F22 shoots it down. CNN uses pic of F35 in thumbnail. 👏
THERE IS NOTHING BEING KEPT FROM US, IF YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED TO DR STEVEN GREER AND HIS 100S OF OFFICIALS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD ALONG WITH ALL THE PROOF OF THE COVER UPS BACK FRO THE 40S TO KEEP US CALM NAIVITY!
It was a gas bag filled entirely by Jim Acostas hot air!!!!
I bet the scientist  are minds blown, but also means they’re excited, because they get to study alien technology. scientist  would be like f🤬🤬🤬you I want to study that. Scientist will definitely be happy to finally be able to study a real UFO the stories about them are actually true, and  get to study it.😅😅😅😅
I’m just surprised that the news is actually reporting, UFOs or spy, planes, or balloons. Like 50 years ago, it was auto nonsense now people acknowledge the real cause it’s either a spyplane or aliens.😅😅😅😅
When MSM starts talking about aliens and ufos, then you know they must be keeping you distracted from something else.
So was this A balloon or 🛸 UFO.  Can they be copy cat's of what they are seeing. Every Day it's something. So I'm guessing they aren't hard to take down.  Bless the USA.
Hmmm why not talking about the currant events happening in Ohio?
you'd figure the cia and nsa would probably be doing dat reverse engineering, cuz teh know how hack in to shit, unlike fbi
Project Bluebeam??
It's kind of hard to shoot down fantasy.
Don't look up...
With americas advance technology, not one physical evidence shown of the said objects. And yet u can send the most advanced aircraft to outerspace. Laughable isn't it.
How does CNN get away with this stuff, likelythe pilots are under military hush.  Making something out of nothing.
Hope their no missing plane with two or three hundred passengers on board
Ridiculous clown show!
CNN CHINESE NEWS NETWORK 😆😆
Oh great the FBI that means just like we get from cnn..a bunch of Bullsnot!
Do us all a favour stop lying tell the truth it’s UFOs they shut down
The government would never tell you the truth about the object or what they have recovered, .but we all know it is a UFO identified, isn’t it funny or a bit strange are they showed us photos of the fighter jet shooting down the spy balloon, which they showed on the news. But why haven’t they show the degree of the two objects? Oh shut down what are they covering up?
The balloon is obvious that there planning a attack on the home land.. jus think about it they already said that after the Ukraine attack that the u.s was next.. I watch every video of the attack and China and Russia is planning something..
Anything and everything 😂you see on national media television is FALSE or disinformation 🤯🤯. Do you seriously think that they would report the truth???? It’s all BS & it’s a shame. They know exactly what it was cause LOCKHEED SKUNK WORKS made them. Wake up 🐑 ppl
5:16 "shelved... couldn't figure it out"  Wow!
I wouldnt trust anything from  CNN
Sounds more like government training missions. Collecting data on the general public's responses to such actions. 😏
Aliens less dangerous than our own governments secrets
thankyou for your information
Why does everyone act like shit like this is new. Its been documented since even before world war 2 for god sakes. Just literally put in 1% effort. The footage and documentation is LITERALLY EVERYWHERE.
Why the hell doesn’t anyone give an update on what information has been obtained on the last three UFO’s that were shot down.  Seems the government is going to keep things under hush and lie to the people once again!
Lol this is CNN
I think there's something about Alaska that is of interest to the superpowers.
I was going to watch this.. then I seen it was CNN... FACK News channel 🤔
Man dang ! We shot down some poor vacationing Aliens . This is gonna be another cover up like in 1947 🤦‍♂️…. Which we didn’t shoot down the ufos in 1947 , I’m just saying
We need to be more afraid of what's in the world and not what comes in the world.!
Are we really that stupid??? These are Nuclear Delivery Vehicles. China is trying to test and see how far they could fly under the radar.   🙄 Duh!!!!
If it's from China there will be a sticker  somewhere on it saying so
Omg yall still talking about other countries trolling us stop it
I doubt this is a ufo (extraterrestrial origin), since aliens use faster ships
Steven Greer spoke about this years ago...
She said  F-35s were sent up, yet their own list of "What We Know" has it listed as an F-22
Keep people in a state of confusion while they doing things on the back end..if the pilots actually seen something they wouldn't be able to say anything what so ever
Look. Any ' UFO, first contact type craft' would just fly away. I.E. the footage released from the Pentagon confirm craft that are capable of hypersonic speeds and amazing acceleration and deceleration. These are earth built craft that have so many different ways to use it, defensive or offensive.
"Aliens" are in the audience, some rogue nation is sprinkling disease or homebrew ballooners are UP to their knees in no good. This is so last century.
And they didn't take a pic. Come on !
The key issue is how these objects just suddenly appeared? Why were they not tracked before they were well into North American airspace?
ah, the chinese are watching if america are mobilizing to help Ukraine, its common sense
CNN….Jim the liar..Trump with wings.
Hope they do use all
Obviously these are news people paid by or deceived by the 'shadow' government to spread lies.
Chinese spy balloon all over the news, this happens 1 day then silence.. hmmmm 🤔
Ok, so now whether or not you believe in aliens 👽 depends on whether you’re a democrat or republican. This is starting to remind me of “don’t look up.”
Martians are invading the USA, Rumsfeld has the evidences!!
A week ago they spend 3 missiles to put down a 12 dollars balloon 😂😂😂😂😂.  2 missiles did not hit the target.    Poor balloon was belong to a club and they say we spend 12 usd for it.       Hahahhah😂😂😂.
Other pillars few times.   How many planes they send.   ?   A F35  flight /hour is 38.000 USD.      So when she say twice that’s mean at list 2.    Look where 100.000 dollars go 😂😂😂😂. Plus staff.  Plus other ground staff salaries.  😂😂😂
Its the drones of gods. Hindu scriptures talk about gods tavelling in vimanas which literally translates to flying objects. They have always been here, were just becoming aware of them....
Fake news CNN
I didnt hear the pilots say anything in this clip
Drone from Alibaba
Y’all liars 😂
so was this a baloon
So CNN is saying aliens now….   What are they trying to prevent us from looking at?
It’s call operation: blue beam… nothin more nothin less
The et disclosure process....do we want to know the truth?
And they dont have video but we can video everything else
I'm surprised the gov.told us they shot something down
All those jets have on board cameras, show us the photos.
$10k balloon, shot by $100k+ stinger missle.
Team rocket at it again!
Pilots been seeing stuff and have been keeping it hush
LOL clown pilots don't understand the concept of a floating balloon
It's life Jim, but not as we know it.
And no one took pictures or video of it with their cell???? . . . .  PLEASE!!!!
Crazy how aliens appear when governments don’t want us to look at other subjects
Grounding of planes will become normal due to  unknown objects flying in our skies.👽 Mining ⛏️ the moon and using our water to cool equipment
Whenever usa is in deep shit they invente some mess lol of course it's "great mystery" How people are still stupid to believe usa politicians or fbi or cnn lol wow
Ancients of Mu-Mu  !
It was my birthday 🎈🎈🎈 😱 they think it's a UFO 😱
False flag operation.
Bullshit, they know exactly what it is!
if this is what we are being told Im terrified to know what goes unsaid ...and isnt public knowledge
Always impossible to get into the circle? So the pre Xi Jing Ping era when the CIA briding their way into the CCP doesn't count? Lol
Gonna see pictures
Ufo
There is no such thing it's a deception on America's path
WW3 naah, Chernobyl in Ohio naah, Aliens yeaaaah
This UFO debacle is fear mongering at its best. A political stunt to make the POTUS look strong. Anything for a vote.
They recovered nothing and are no longer looking. This was all BS to show people that Joe Biden was doing something and not taking another nap.
Propulsion was WINDS Aloft, what kept it aloft is called Helium Gas.
This is a hoax story. US Govt is the master of lies and cheats to bully its citizens.
Bob bear in Spanish is Bob Oso. If you know; you know.
This guy talking is a damn moron, These objects shot down have nothing to do with the china balloons.   The pilots themselves have stated that this object did not have no visible means of propulsion, or how to navigate, they said they had no idea how this thing was able to fly and maneuver in the air. This is not a technology that any country has, to have some sort of vehicle that can fly very fast at 30 to 40,000 feet, with no visible means of propulsion is beyond our science.  So anyone blaming China or another country of doing this is a stupid and as dumb as they come, probably just another dumb ass, trying to hide or confuse the truth of it all 😡
It's a diversion to keep our minds off a corrupt president and Jeffery epstein friends
Even if the FBI finds anything unusual, they won't tell the public. And if they did tell the public then it's going to be a lie. Gov: "It was just a weather balloon over the united states there's no need to worry.  And the other ones were weather balloons too." Never trust the government no matter what they say. They're there for themselves only.
I don't think ufos wud let us shoot them down they are so fast it's amazing also they probly have sheelds
Brainwashing People to War: Scare Tactics.
FBI? Y NOT MILITARY?
Pics or it didn't happen
wait so out of all the galaxies and all the countries these ufos came to the us over all the other nations ... got it makes sense.
Prevention of a alien good invasion of their money system law
https://youtu.be/s2RflgAMyUw
Just great we just shot down Aliens, now we started a war with them.  Americans are too damn paranoid shooting everything.  smh
History has shown that CNN is a low rate reporting agency pretending to be a News Agency and perpetuating DoDo for ratings.  Anyone with a brain that has watch CNN in the past, knows they are Children full of "SH--!
If the FBI gets involved, we'll never get ANY information!
Aliens just looking over us making sure we don't wreak ourselves, like they've always have through human history.
Don’t worry about aliens guys I’d be more worried about governments all around the world we need to take back what’s ours. Fuck the government
It makes sense to announce no recoveries like in Roswell, NM if it's unknown the Govt will keep it secret.  The General said object was circular and then cylinder now they are all 🎈s. Oh n no country is claiming them like China's  balloons. Suspicious minds indeed. 👽
Rule out Aliens. If they're able to traverse light years through the Universe, they can deflect any feeble attempt our weapons have to try and take a craft down. These are earthly craft probably from one of our enemies who no longer respect the USA
Believing anything from CNN is believing pigs fly.
As well you should be.
And JIM, why are you not reporting on bidens classified documents or hunters criminal laptop or 10 percent for the big guy??????????
Nice cover for the Nord stream pipeline sabotage...stay asleep americant
I heard you and the Lemon are lovers?
It's powered by Bullshit !!!.
It's the old USA 🇺🇸 tactic of diverting the world's attention from the real problem: ECOLOGICAL ACCIDENT in Ohio - in the peaceful city of East Palestine…
Not the FBI!!
If Alien's do come into our airspace once they see what goes on in this world they'll be like,,,let's get the f out of here
The  new Roswell
What about the pipeline Biden blew up? Get your heads out of your ass! Do you think we can shoot down what we can't catch let alone even know how it works? Focus on the pipeline!
CNN : CHINESE NEWS NETWORK 😆😆😆😆
Hopefully they are here for joe biden.
I thought CNN fired this dude?
What level of Jumanji are we on today? 😅
I think the government just needs to be completely open with us about UFOs. We are at the point that most people are desensitized about everything so it’s not gonna call some type of mass panic. Presidents have even admitted that there have been UFOs here. It’s no big secret now. They need to be open and honest.
But nobody says how fast any of these have been traveling...,🧐🤔
This is all a bunch of crap to keep you from seeing what they don't want you to see. Basic magician sleight of hand
CNN LMAO
I thought trump banished this chump
Military mumbo jumbo, in an effort to keep the country's citizenry çalm. They know its origin, they know it's not from earth. They will not say it, directly...ever, until they have no choice, I believe they will get even larger, very soon; Then, it will become undeniable. This is not the first event, something is trying to make contact, shooting it down is not advisable, until we know it's purpose, for sure. We are an aggressive species historically. That's not good.
No pilots on the show lol click bait
When I was 13-14 my family lived in the country (10miles to the closest neighbour) One night I came outside to get something from the car and noticed a ufo hovering near the end of the drive way (was about 25 meters away)  It took about 10 seconds to register what I was actually seeing and when I did all I remember is talking in a really deep gasp of air and the next thing I know I’m inside my house on the floor with my family around me freaking out. I did my best to explain what I saw but I was hysterical and bleeding from my noise and mouth. Whatever happened to me I don’t know but I thought it was only just a few minutes that I was gone but apparently I was actually gone for over 2 hours and my family was looking for me but then I burst through the door.  A lot more followed but I don’t want to put it all on here, there’s too much.  I swear on my life this is a %100 true story!!!!!Im adding this later as an after though,  when I try to think of what happened during the 2hrs I was missing I just have this knowing or feeling of being under water but still able to breath and kinda like an hollow or echoing feeling.... The best I can explain...
So the USA don't and never have used hi altitude spy devices U2 and , global Hawks not just used for spying. You all do it to each other and have for 50+ years. To put it simply what's the problem? Even cartels probably use them or at least think about it. In the cold war you lot all played chicken fly as fast as possible at the enemy and see  what happens lol just get over it there easier ways to do it
Now it seems the USA is not the leader in technology as other countries continue to envade our airspace to show our country vulnerability in the event of an attack on our soil .We don't know until it's to late
Pure disclosure ty cnn
Better blame china 🎉
It’s like if the planet or the galaxy and its citizen all gone mad at once  I mean did god drop the remote ? Yes I think he got tired of our shit back in 2012 and now we’re just alone on a planet that can’t take our shit anymore 😂
It’s hard to identify something that’s going 10 mph. when you are moving at 2000 mph.That’s why they have a hud screen,duh !
All the other "good" news is just passing us by without notice, let's focus on balllooooooons 😁Always need an outside enemy..
The best CNN
$400,000 per sidewinder missile shot at China or the Friendly aliens Unprovoked.... more than the aircraft that Fired them!!
When with neighborhood kids we gathered a few  pieces of zinc, some HCL, a dry cleaning cover bag, string and a meter of tin foil it slowly floated up shining in the sun, when it got way over the city, it set the town abuzz with ufo radio reports, folks with binoculars, fire engines and sirens going off ...really unexpected reaction to a school experiment at home...... hmm ....I think our budget for the launch was under two bucks ...now quite a bit older, it may also be a heckofa way to fly grandads ashes! ie without the tin foil.
Bs artist
For God's sake...most of us know it's more bull---- from our government.  UFOs have been here millions of years, most of them to help us. And the fact that some of them are our relatives. More people need to research how we got here to begin with
Getting tired of listening to he said she said show some pictures or stop propaganding for the government
Anyone else find it strange that the American government has halted their search for the remaining alleged UFOs? Also, don't you find it strange that the spy balloon was shot down the day after the train derailment? When is the government ever this open to the public in the media about such things? I hope that everyone in Ohio receives appropriate care and support.
Whats normal?
if there is a takeover in russia or china we might be wishing putin and xi back....   scary thought...  but a plausible one...
What a joke ,  this is on world stage  make USA  look stupid
"No means of propulsion."...oh you mean like...A BALLOON?!? 😑
The pilots are USA government workers they speak what they are told to say.
Much ado about nothing. When a country is full of hatred , jealousy and fear of another country. the concern country is not able to think rationally. They become hysterical over a balloon? Those balloons are all over the globe at any one time. Wow, they even inform 40 countries. They are hell bent to pick a fight. They think China is easy lay. Poor China.
The info they getting from the debris??? Mane this white America! They keeping that undercover like Eipstein 🤫 Rape our pockets in-prison are children and help with wars for relationships. Fucking idiots. And yet we just deal with it. 😢
Aliens there coming for us 100% true
CNN busy cooking stuff for the brainwashed folks, to sell a gov't narrative
It boggles my mind that we use other organisms for our gain yet are so arrogant to believe that we sit atop the food chain, by ourselves,. Solely by ourselves. At least be grateful that our overlords don’t outright butcher and eat us and at least let us have cellphones. Ungrateful cattle 👀
I'm officially desensitized guys thanks
If this has been turned over to the FBI, you can kiss any similarity to "truth" being revealed.
I trust used car salesmen more that Jim Acosta.
If u sent an iPhone 200 years into the past they would be completely puzzled as well.
It’s giving info back to a galaxy far far away, they won’t be able to work it out because our technology carnt do that yet.
Considering all that has already came out, why is Blinken still going ? And why has this administration invited Chinese officials to investigate the debris?
China is scheming to enslave the world while the west is busy creating genders. Humanity sure has a bright future.
US Just shot down Without knowing what it is . May idea took from Hollywood story writer's. 😏
Ancient Aliens new season? High budget promo? China or maybe... extraterrestrials!
We're paying our taxes for them (government), and they kept hiding information from us!?
If it interfere with sensors on f35s we need to be worried cause f35s are the most advanced aircraft out. Light years ahead of any known aircraft. I mean we no doubt have more advanced sensors for our new 6th gen fighter. But who knows it coulda been a glitch in 1 plane. They're so advanced they don't even know its full capabilities. A flying super computer.
Wait what debree WTF
Comon if you think Jet22 can shoot down an alien 👽 shuttle or flying object... Rethink how absurd it sounds...
I’m sure it will turn out to be  just a weather balloon.
The United States deliberately used sanctions against Russia to drag the EU to death.
There is no way they would just shoot down something without confirmation of what it is.  No way.  I am Soo tired of secrets from the government. They have no right to hold information about our universe. I've had just about enough of it. Haven't you?
Somehow this is Trumps fault. I bet!!
All a distraction from the real issues
this is all garbage dont listen to anything on the news
Instead of passing along the pilots conflicting accounts why don't they just release the High Resolution Video they took. Alternatively, they could realize the Video that was recorded through the heads up display on the fighters.  Stupid dems trying to snow us.
Why FBI? Would not C I A be encompassing this situation in their more appropriate jurisdiction? FBI not exactly Trustworthy with serious information presently.
Ice road truckers!!!
FBI aka MIB
No fighter jet video?
It's not a 🎈
China's testing it's magnetic pulse system,in advance of attacking out cyber grid.Weaponized magnetic pulses.
If balloons could talk . . . .
Holy shit! Jim Acosta is still there? CNN you have lost all and any credibility.  Oh please do not get too technical because us st"oo"pid Americans may not understand says the guy who worked with this crap for over 20 years.
Joe 🧐🧐🧐has to go !!!!!
This is a distraction. There are trains on fire.
Asylum seekers must have run out of boats now coming in from above 😁
years ago  its not ufo  now its  ballon now ballons turn in ufo  CNNyou are criminals
Aliens come watch idiots who burn toxic chemicals
CNN stil exist  what a joke
If it was "shot down". Where is it? What is it? Show photos. This is all smoke and mirrors. Suck my appendage CNN.
Well it does depend on who told each pilot wot to say lol
Don’t we have protocols for these types of situations?  Did anyone go down to see the wreckage before drawing conclusions?
Didn't Nancy Pelosi go to Taiwan? Didn't that visit also provoke China?!
If you want to know what something is, maybe DONT BLOW IT UP.
So the first half reports on evidence amd asks legit questions while the second half is nothing but unconfirmed assumptions and misinformation. This asshat keeps saying "Chinese balloons" and specifically 5 of them? Where and when was it confirmed these were all Chinese balloons? It wasn't and they aren't
Maybe it never happened, 😳😯
UFO ufo ufo😮
Bs they have film of it!
Hollywood quality stuff.   Now please pretty please increase my tax, and give it to the industrial military complex. These aliens are savages. 🐒 🙈 🍌.  As well as income tax my home, car , food,  gas, fuel, education,  tax my children for whats already mine when I'm dead , tax the air I breathe. Its not what my country does for me , its what I do for my country.
What? Why couldn’t they identify that object.  It has a shape does it have markings what?
I have an idea what it was. Give me time to confer with my sources from other galaxies.
Aliens can't even take a ride out in space any more,they gonna retaliate soon just watch.
How do they know it comes from China?. Does it have a sticker saying Made in China?!
Humans are dangerous people and I hope more civilized will come from other planets to help us and specially neutralizr our nuclear weapons to prevent a tragedy.
Things are getting very scary now that the US have started investing millions of dollars to shoot balloons out of the sky...
DISTRACTIONS DISTRACTIONS!!!!!! TALK ABOUT THE 3 CHEMICAL SPILLS THAT WERE DONE BY OUR GOVERNMENT!!!!!! RIP TO ALL THOSE ALREADY DEAD.
It's a real shame the defence department was too incompetent to find and analyze these crafts. Nothing worse than a bunch of cowards afraid to tell the truth.
Why Blair is not in jail, for the lies. Weapon of mass deceptions.  Shame on you
I just came here to see what propaganda and mental programming MSM is pumping out.
OBVIOUSLY they are lying to the American People again!!
I've not much time for the Scotts, but in this case, they are 100% right about T. Blair.  He caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people The British government had Dr. Kelly killed.  And,  for this, the government gives him a title!  What does this say about the British government?
Another excuse to put people against China.
Martian   ?
Wow. Now I see why cnn is a joke as bad as fox News. They're really trying hard to sell the alien thing. Smdh
The CIA dude immediately canned the pilots integrity. I think it’s just gas escaping from Uranus, glistening off a full moon. Seriously though just remember folks “we must invade Iraq because of weapons of mass destruction” how’d that work out, then it was the talibans fault, another military success not. More sabre rattling, for crusty old generals looking to back a crusty old geriatric in the White House.
Who van believe what CNN says
We’ll know the truth once it’s too late.
Aliens casing the joint . Prepare for invasion in about 100 yrs…..
The pilots saw different things & not balloons: The politicians talk about balloons & NOT the pilots! NASA probably should consider using politicians instead of pilots for space traveling! As far as Aliens & UFO are concerned most of us suspect that our governments are telling us lies for a very long time. Its about time to release the info about UFO’s  long existence & scholars should start rewriting our history of a few thousand years back, because our HISTORY IS WRONG!. Aliens are visiting earth for thousands of years if not millions!..
“We don’t know… But it’s threatening.. “🤔
Hope aliens are about to abduct all of America
Surely every fighter aircraft has video recording and cameras on board.. Where are those photos.?
Find this really weird. I've seen unexplained objects in the sky late at night, and I do not believe that these so called UFOs have been shot down.  Just more fear tactics and pointless narratives. CNN is desperate for views, and continues to tell their own side of every story!
Our Government knows exactly what is going on we will be the last to know
Why all of a sudden are we shooting everything down!?? We have not done this in the past so why now...Since the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, what if these are our craft from area 51 or S2?.....Also who said these objects are from China? Could they be from Russia?
the truth will scare you.
The other 3 SUPPOSED BALLOONS were,  REAL   UFOs !!!!  The Government is LYING and HIDING the information from the Public again !  Ask yourself, WHY they have NOT show the Public ANY of the 3 SUPPOSED BALLOONS that they shot down ???  And they are TRYING to say that the 3 SUPPOSED BALLOONS  ****(MIGHT / MAYBE)***, belong to some PRIVATE or COMMERCIAL entities.  It has been at least 2 WEEKS now, and NOBODY has come forward to claim these 3 SUPPOSED BALLOONS !  And NOW lastly; they have STOPPED searching for the 3 SUPPOSED BALLOONS.    ANYONE with a Brain, can see that our Government, is LYING and HIDING something about these 3 SUPPOSED BALLOONS !  And the AMERICAN people really need to SPEAK UP, and force the Government to tell the Public the TRUTH, about these UFO sightings!  I think these 3 SUPPOSED BALLOONS, were REAL UFOs;. and they are HIDING the Truth!  Something SUSPICIOUS is definitely going on with these 3 SUPPOSED BALLOONS they shot down.
Strange they are trying to distract us from something important.  There are a couple things that demands better news coverage.
Ugh this is so boring. Can we please just get to the alien talk?! 👽
I saw the same thing. I was watching Cheech and Chong "Up in Smoke". It was amazing..😳 here 🤏😳 🤯🛸🤪
It's a sad thing when the American people can't trust their own government. No one believes the B.S. they are trying to tell us. One news report said they had pictures of the unknown objects, taken before they shot them down. Let us see them or  shut the hell up and stop insulting our intelligence. Let us see these "objects"; maybe we can tell you what they are, since you don't seem to have a clue.
Jim Acosta....Trump is your Daddy
We'll never be told
Biden in his briefing confirmed that the 3 objects were not from china or any other country??? Does that mean not from earth???
Shut the f'up , get on with it . if its a UFO or gap SAY IT !
What I can't figure out is why did we put a person in the white house whose does dealings with Russia and his son to ,and then he acts is he mad at Russia ,and I don't know. How trump didn't win that election ,when he done everything he said he would do ,and plus not get paid to be president ,he was on to something that binden or his son was doing over there,trump was doing great as president ,then this binden comes out of know where and wins ,hell he can't even tell you the time of day it is,
CUNT CUNT NETWORK COVERS THIS BULLSHIT BUT NOT THE OHIO RAILROAD DISASTER? CAUSE CNN CUNTS ARE OWNED BY THE RAILROAD COMPANIES! WHAT ELSE IS BEING HIDDEN FROM US!? THIS IS ALL JUST MISINFORMATION AND MISDIRECTION.
More lies and cover ups by the dangerous biden Whitehouse. He needs to be impeached soon before he drags us into world war 3.
Looks like a red Dawn movie only difference it wasn't a balloon, abd people jumped out of it possible a case to take people minds off whats really happening, do they really know where it came from
I can help you payoff your equity line of credit debts and credit card debts for free most Americans own debts and can barely afford to pay with this current inflation and high interest rates of banks so sad
Ask Osama Been Biden about the sabotage of the NordStream ll  pipeline.    😀😀😀😀
You rotton perrito lol trump basher
What it look like!!!!!!🥰😊
The narrative that the guy in grey gives is pretty clear
It's the sasquatch
Where are the cameras on the jets? Seems like a needed basic piece of equipment! 🤔
People, its just government playing with their toys.......AND THE PUBLIC IS THEIR FAVORITE!
CIA common idiot's airbutts
I wouldn’t worry. Aliens/UFO have been visiting hearth for thousands of years. Just look at inscriptions on the pyramids. If a nuclear war breaks out the Aliens will save the planet. Not sure about humans though. In my belief the Aliens made this world & we are being monitored very closely. Maybe man is just an alien experiment.
They just announced they can find NO DEBRIS...Very suspicious...How can you not find debris in a lake or on ice....BS
I don't think its was at that time balloon after the one from chinese.  Its strange after 6 day we still not know wath it is and were them come from
Biological weapons. If you explode that Chinese balloon over a major US city. Full of whatever sickness they come up with once the wind picks it up. We'd be fucked-
Why no objects have been shown on any media...strange
Jeez Bobs got old!
Size of a small car? Must be a Volkswagen shoot it downnn
Fox news and Trump and his Republican Nazis Cult party is the people pushing the Chinese government and Russian government and the north Korea, Trump is the Republican Party leader, and all of the new young Republican Party like Santos the Russian spy.
Aliens will attack us soon ask I type they are on there way here. Jesus help us....I am Jesus LOL.
Real life wakanda on this planet
No propulsion could be organic
They wanted to see where it will land but didn’t land in our country so shot it down before it leaves our territory
Aliens ~ take me to your leader   Joe Biden  Alien's Nevermind
Ha Ha  Shooting down a weather balloon with a 400K missile.
Damn that's all this country do is gossip about everything anymore,now you got fighter pilots going crazy also.
This visitor from Nitnup, has traveled much from location of  Anihc near the constellation Nari. These balloon shape craft are missile gathering and attention seeking weapons of mass hysteria.
The Criminal Joe Biden and the Democratic Crime Syndicate will be brought to justice.
This is just Communist News Network trying to pishba lie in the public again.
Biden(a raging lunatic) gave the orders to blow up a 20+billion energy project Russia & Germany built to bring reliable energy supplies to Germany & Europe. This is an International act of terrorism. CNN/FNN continues to give stupid airtime to absurd balloon stories!  This is a side show to the real NEWS! Biden is now an international terrorist and CNN/FNN is not giving this story the coverage it deserves! Biden looks into the camera and lies! Blunt Lies! Biden is just like his son Hunter. Hunter (sitting naked) looks into his laptop and sparks up a Crack Joint without the slightest shred of remorse and toots away then opens a beer to wash it all down. He looks into his Laptop with a ( I don't give a F*** what you think!). Biden is just like Hunter, looks into the camera and lies, bluntly lies. Biden should be relieved of his duties and sent to therapy or put in a straight jacket!
Is this guy trying to be a clown!?...
USA made balloons. Misdirection.....usual bull shit.
The only time in history when the UFO is actually a fkn balloon 🎈
The government knows what it is and we will never know
Hey look! No more inflation!
Diversion, check the Epstein list
Like Trump said we had stupid people running this country remember 9/11
Nobody is saying anything about the white powder that comes out of those balloons what is this white powder that is where the problem is
its a fbi scam ?
Trying to hide Ohio’s accident? A Century ago people were cleverer than US cotizens today?
As a shot down alien Zmay from Proxa2y Galaxy I strongly protest, we were just cruisin around admiring the nature below..barbaric act. Now I have to wait for the extraction team.
When you re not supposed to look at man made robots with guns just look up and be mystified
Maybe it was a big white old dude with a long beard flying with a sled pulled by raindeers. He could have been just testing his new sled or coming back with grocery.
Maybe it was a big white old dude wit a long beard flying with a sled pulled by raindeers. He could have been just testing his new sled or coming back with grocery.
Notice this is the *only* time any propaganda outlets (oops, I mean media outlets) addressing what the piolets say. As is SOP, they are concealing the truth via not allowing those piolets to give their *first hand* accounts.  That strongly points to the objects being *extra terrestrial*
Title says "Hear what pilots said about yadda yadda.." with the key word HEAR. There's 3 people on the segment clip with nothing concrete on adding,  no cockpit radio mic-feed transmission and neither no pilots interviewed other than the input of what intelligence, analysts, everyone and their mother's already know which makes this a satirical click bait courtesy of CNN.  .. smh
Curiously, no pilot had bad breath after coming in proximity to the Tic Tac shaped object. One pilot said his mouth was minty fresh.
Does anybody really care about this story? Honestly, the amount of attention this is getting is ridiculous.
And all these rescue and retrieval teams didn't find anything? That's suspicious... Look at the trajectory of the Chinese balloon basically it was following these objects it was on the same trajectory from Alaska all the way to the south east of the United States. The Chinese are tracking these alien propulsion less objects.... They don't need a balloon over the United States they can look that up with Google Maps.... These are not man Made crafts. There is no way a balloon can stay still at forty thousand feet altitude or anything that we can build. . The military not saying anything is a big cover up.
CNN? What about Ohaio? What about destroying Nordstream-2? And your balls not yours!)
Holograms, Look up Blue Beam Proj.
PLASTIC CRAP FILLED WITH HELLIUM TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE AN UFO, BUT THE REAL UFOs WILL NEVER LET YOU APPROACH THEM AND WILL DASH OUT AT BREAK NECK SPEEDS, SO NOPE THESE ARE HUMAN MADE TO CONFUSE THE PILOTS AND RADARS. REMEMBERED THOSE UAPs THE NAVY HAVE ENCOUNTERED OVER THE OCEAN? THEY TOYED WITH THE F-18s AND THE AWACS COULD NOT EVEN LOCATED THEM EASILY LIKE THESE ONES, C'MON STOP THE STUPIDITY PLEASE !!!
I hope aliens like burgers
Just another embarrassment of the Biden administration. NOTHING TO SEE HERE!
We had also seen that balloons here in the Philippines, the govt. Started to investigate and they came up with conclusions that it was a "Spy- balloon"  from China, It's terrifying, the fact we don't know what they are planning.. Just stay cautious and knowledgeable, folks.
This is scary
Can’t trust anything these people say…
Can’t trust anything these people say…
Its probably carrying a virus...
Mabey its jesus  because he can fly also, right??? Lololololol
Bullshit reporting on nothing. Get back to the FBI and Twitter collusion.
It's called a Hologram..bthey want you to look there when you should be looking her. Wake tf up
🛸 👽 👾 🛸
This is all bullshit.  Look somewhere else my fellow Americans
Doctor evils blimp has returned that looks like a big ,Johnson
Lies lies lies
Apparently the Chines and Russians have had similar recent experiences with unknown aerial phenomena.
Uh, maybe it’s a false flag by Russia to interfere with diplomacy with China that may have curtailed their support for Russia.
Americans love to speculate 🙄 A golden rule of shooting at any object is that it is important to identify it properly before doing so. So much for trigger happy Americans🙄🙄
This is a distraction
Communist News Network
I hope it's aliens, the thought of a foreign power having advanced tech, flying in our airspace is way scarier to me. Unfortunately I have a bad feeling that aliens aren't to blame.
UFO. ... And "Mach 6".. ! Figure it out.
I'm more concerned about Ohio
It could be spy stuff over nuclear or secret American bases?
Send over Chicken Fried Rice! I'm so hungry!
Oh boy how are people getting more and more dumb..... Is it something in the air or in our foods drinks?
Are you kidding me. my car has a camera on it. Our fighter jets should be able to easily video document this.  Bullshit.
Cnn is a joke. Always was
How do they know is a Chinese object?
dis·trac·tion       אתה מלא בזה
The Chinese should be sending more colorful and fun balloons for the Biden and Media circus. Send in the media clowns !
One could even speculate on a 'distracting' operation - diverting attention from something else which is being planned? Bah!
Cnn fake news media.
Oh yea
Makes Me Think of War of The Worlds. An Alien Race Would First Send Probes To Check the Planetary Response. Let Us Hope They Are Impressed a Little.
Even they don’t know what they said😂
Hard to believe any news from cnn. Proven liars  fraud.
This dude is only estimating what he thinks and seriously he
Lol so stupid ...america so stupid but look who run it
I’m sorry did they just say Mach 6
The US navy shot down a UFO that crashed directly on the Nordstream gas pipe and destroyed it.
I'm thinking it's a start of false flag event
Massive psyop by the government and its owned msn to deflect attention away from the nord pipe scandal. And most of the public are not falling for it we are more intelligent than you think we are.
CNN = FAKE NEWS
Umm yeah
How can anyone think that the things that was shot down are ufo.  do you really think any actual alien craft will be shot down at the speed they can go. The only way we could get a ufo down is if it crashed. Their technology would be far superior.  it wouldn’t surprise me if we ourselves had crafts that were pretty advanced that didn’t use the common compulsion system. it’s either to scare us for control and they’ll say it’s alien and they are hostile.  if aliens have been here and visiting for years and years then I’m Pretty sure we’d already been under attack well before now. So clearly aliens are not hostile to us.  So for me it’s our own government using this as a cover up and for control in a scare tactic and a diversion for something bigger coming.
Don’t be naïef why would we be the only life form out there in the black space!
You have to question why they are telling us these conflicting stories because one thing is for certain they are telling us this for some reason …. Probably a distraction for what’s really happening and that we’ll never know because all governments and media worldwide are corrupt
The Northern Illinois Bottle Cap Balloon Brigade spent between $12 & $100 for a weather balloon. Its last known location was near Alaska at 39,000 feet on February 10th...  Two $400,000 missiles plus the scrambling of jets... a million bucks.  Damn right they called off the search for debris. They dont want the balloon remnants found.
Trust NOTHING FROM THE CLINTON NEWS NETWORK  They only report what the CABAL tells them PERIOD.
😂😂😂😂 Look are you kidding think beyond 2000 we watched it where did all the tech disappear too 😂😂😂😂 100 years
Stop it!!!,they are trained my boy trained eyes to protect their countries 😂😂😂 they know exactly
This why I question when people boast about how far advanced our military is I take a step back. Because the initial reaction seems to be adolescent/inexperienced . If all they say about area 51 is true none of the reactions to certain situations would come across as a bull in a china shop.
The truth will be kept as a secret. But since these accidents were too obvious and in the era of social media it’s impossible to hide anything,they just had to come up with two lies, so humans would be drifting from one lie to another, instead of drifting from one lie to the truth.
The should have said that the balloons look like a black man.... it would've been shot down in micro seconds. Lol.
The lies......
I read somewhere that the Moon is too big a place to be NOT populated by anyone. In comparison, Mars is a much bigger place to be NOT populated by anyone. I am a believer rather than a sceptic.
Pretty faces, ignorance, lies, ignorance, CNN isn't as bad as Fox. But CNN is bad!
China, Russia, getting the blame.  Same BS as always from these idiots.
More & more lies
Mystery
i don't think the FBI should be looking in on this case they should let someoneles take the lead on this
Palak bapak kamuuu
My redemption draws near.
As I mentioned on twitter, You got your smoke and you got your mirrors.
Always confusing with these folks
CNN spinning the story towards “Chinese technology “. Give me a break.  This shit is not from China.  Or from Russia.  Or from any country.
Most likely a distraction from a major unfair development taking place somewhere
They are setting up to launch biological and chemical warfare
Riskey  response
Natasha & Bob...please stop entertaining and spreading fake news. It's all BS. It also had to be in Alaska... flying @ a lower altitude... it's an iceberg that melted and went up to heaven. Yes bob you talking no sense. why don't you guys try finding Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370/MAS370)
It's a grey area 👽
Bullshit
Some moos hunter in a playn
99 luftballons
Ditto
I wonder what they are trying to divert our attention from?  Train chemical bombing in Ohio?
Maybe identify your shit before you shoot it down
I get told I worship a Sky Fairy by the same people who believe in little green men. LMAO
Sounds like another round of false flags
Wht ever it really is there not going to tell us.
Sad news RIP
Fear fear fear,make everyone fear!give no explanation so fear intensifies,and then people will believe all the lies,and believe the government will save them.Have no fear,believe what the bible says,it's all in there,those with eyes will see those with ears will hear.I challenge each person that reads this to read the bible,start with the gospel of John,and sincerely pray for the Holy Spirit for discernment in these end of days.Great trouble is coming,such that the world has never seen.Read your bibles,read the history, Our Lord Jesus is coming,be ready,dear people the beast is here ,the last antichrist is here ready to make himself known, he will show gratitude wonders,do not be deceived..
Another life form , probable extraterrestrial are trying to contact us . We should try something to communicate as opposed to shooting down . Man has a great opportunity now to enhance our knowledge of the Universe
Natasha, you are beautiful.
CHINA AND JOE BIDEN ARE PLAYING MIND GAMES TO MAKE BIDEN. POPULAR IN THE SIGHT OF AMERICAN PEOPLE ! REMEMBER. BIDEN IS TALKING ABOUT 2024 AND WE THE PEOPLE WANT HIM IMPEACHED HE IS OWNED BY CHINA !
U willl never shoot down an alien craft never ,those things are more 19million times advanced than humas NEVER EVER, dont lie to people USA
Alll lies
we all knows its  all a social conditioning taking place as they prepare the masses for the upcoming   fake alien invasion    #project blue beam. #newworldorder #oneworldgoverment #oneworldreligion  the next biggest scam is  gonna happen in 2024 as they planned    research project blue beam.
FBI..Federal Bull$h!+ Information
Americans saw the Iraq WMD from space..but when up close, its just a wedding party..Bomb it anyway...
After decades of unidentified objects in the skys and they're just now shooting them down....suspicious
That conflicting reports.. different people seeing different things means it’s deception .. demonic
Oh, look at me shaking in my boots. because of this big balloon.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤪
What could be keeping it in the air? It's called "lift". No two witnesses ever agree. Sounds like a bunch of space nerds.
Balloons have no discernable propulsion system
It's those damn aliens again. Always mucking things up, they are.
Why all this worry about Ex Equestrians. Maybe they were just horsin about?
experimental flying object out of control, needs to be shot down..
They won't know until they know; is that not the character of any mystery? The world does not operate on 24 hr new cycles so news outlets will continue to chase their tails until the experts divulge what they have found spreading endless speculation.
It's simple.. They are CCP spy balloons. The CCP has been deploying these balloons for years. But the media will tell you anything but the truth.
If these balloons or whatever were not "our top secret high technology", what reason would the government, that we pay for, have to keep this information from us?  It is our information.  We paid for the ability to shoot them down.  Now tell us what we paid for with our money.
Nah it's tarielka soviet UFO 🤭
I got the CNN News about the Elian thing, thank you.
"Frozen water". Come on people, up your game.
Yeah cnn doing cnn shit. Meaning this gotta be fabricated
Why don’t they have the best video camera s on all the military’s aircrafts.   Not the military’s ufo s of course.  They don’t need no camera because they are supposed to not exist.   There Alien. Look up Wernher Von Braun s assistant said when she gave her testimony on the weapons on the moon and the alien hoax that the military’s been playing since the 30’s or 40’s   Go ahead and watch her full testimony.  I can only find clips of her address to Congress.    It’s all s giant lie. It’s all About The Alien hoax
Will smith in independence day comes to mind with this story
They're thinking that the three unidentified things that they shot down into deep waters have distracted people from the Chernobyl event that they created in Ohio! OR they tried to cover up their failure to not shoot a CCP spy balloon  for 5 days OR they tried to hide their secret meeting with the corrupt Qatar and Iran's regimes? - They want to give Iran's devil regime billions of dollars (blocked in South Korea) to release  3-4  US/Iranian citizens that were held hostage in Iran! while over 15,000 Iranians are in the jails, after recent demonstrations against Iran's terrorist regime!  - Then the Iran devil regime could give more upgraded kamikaze drones to Putin to keep the international tension and war longer! - In 2020 rush to evacuate Kabul airport, they shot a house by drone beside Kabul airport and announced it was ISIS center, then they found out 10 civilians including kids got killed! - Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, SIGAR:' The U.S. has provided $8 B in aid to Afghanistan since Aug 2021, and whether these aids are humanitarian in nature or otherwise, they may unintentionally legitimize the Taliban!!' - The aid operation in Afghanistan relies on a cash transfer line by the United Nations, where shipments of $40 M are transferred from the New York reservation to Kabul! The Taliban spent this money just for their relatives trip to the U.S. or gave it to their militias!
Bcz they lyin
I never watched or listened. CNN is as reliable as China News Net. Totally Fake News for the braindead.
Better to shoot it down if it's not from us 💯 🤷
China has alot more to loose by escalating tensions.  we loose cheep things that break easy.  They loose a Trade Dynamic supporting their, ....well, EVERYTHING !
ITS A TIC-TAC AND THEY WONT ADMIT IT.  Them things use field propulsion.
Omni Solutions
I believe all fighters jet has a surveillance camera.
Hundreds of pro pilots identified UFO's in decades, now, conveniently they get "conflicting" reports, are not sure what they saw... flying at Mach 2+ against weather balloons drifting a slow wind speed. Come on! And, off course, a security analyst will heavily support this and ramp it up to be an alien threat, provocation, .., anything to justify more attributions from congress for star wars. Amateurish stories, like the first balloons spotted by civilians, alerted the military. Excuse the pun but it's full of thin air. Your CIA analyst mean to tell US taxpayers that an F22 air superiority fighter costing $216 million, flown by pilots, costing $10.6 million *(check it out) in training, get confused about a weather balloon? Or a very slow. random moving, floating ball of air, that's supposed to be a UFO of possible "alien" origin? And these "aliens" disappear as little puffs of white smoke, deflated acrylic shell, and some weather sensors equipment. Where are the photos?
The latest explanation was used car balloons. Another coverup. The Japanese used balloons during WWII to fly over the US and start forest fires in the northwest. It was less than successful, but that is the way the wind blows, from China to the USA. I hope we finally get some usual info,  but I doubt it.
Yeah .Yeah ..like the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
CNN is going belly up! Nobody listens to the BS anymore... Oh well💥🐾🐻‍❄️
Emp drones that's what's next
Still no update???? Still looking for it?!!! Six days later WOW
come on pilots shooting down objects that they cant identfiy like WTF
Such BS...this distraction was predicted last yeàr. The arms dealers need more contracts...running out of money for their coke habits maybe? Go to Ohio for the real news. God bless
With everything that's happening do you really trust our own government diversion
Biden riding a balloon??
Could it be that the balloons are designed to confound and confuse? What if they released 100 balloons or 1,000 all at once?   What technically might this do if a truly threatening device were released amid them or in their wake? Very curious.
uhh how could it go mach 6 and the pilots couldn't determine what the propulsion system is duh obviously not from an earth civilization.
We will never get an honest explanation of this object
ET phone home
Probably a Chinese research balloon, trying to look for resources to Steal.
How about when this crap decides to shoot back?
This is not funny guys and gals!
So they were scared and couldn’t match stories! It wasn’t Aliens!!!
same exact propaganda the. government and news  outlets pushed right before pearl harbor! same month even! LMAO
Drones from China
Debris NORAD n he’s absolutely fascinated by the taste of horsehit with a little sidebar of White House’ Q n A …. Geeeeez we don’t know
USA spy on the whole world 24/7 .
Distraction generator is werking over time y’all eat that spoon full of bullshit… we’ll make more via the corporate News Media !! Yum yum yum
Media controlled lies to the american people yet again. WE have to wake up and smell the BS.
Suppose one day they shot it down but it will not fall down but keep on going,  now that b a trip what they going to do then when they can't stop it or bring it down.
Another virus coated in a sphere of Mysterious Flying Object
interesting that special forces were used to recover......?  if it is not a big deal ....top secret forces were used to recover without public  knowledge
Is that a weather balloon sequel?
I'm more worried out the Clinton News Network still on wild agendas. Lol
When the hell are we going to take our world back from these corrupt and treasonous government officials and the elites in charge of all these lies We the people need to know when is this POS Biden and his administration going to be publicly executed for their corruption and treasonous bullshit against the United States and the world
I’m calling BS on everything that comes out this administration
Pilot: it looks like a party balloon. Fine, I will shoot it down so you can take a look too. This is not going to make some kids happy.
Possibly contained one part of a 2 part mixture. Balloon enters air of a certain temperature and that change in temperature activates whatever’s inside and the balloon is shot down releasing whatever china put in it to fuck us up. Stop destroying them and instead try and capture it in tact or divert its flight back to china
They are testing our reaction time and efforts exerted in determining origin and reasoning. Send em there and we attack from here.
Yippie, America has declared war on aliens
Who trusts the FBI?
I don't understand why they did not use just a balloon to collect the intruder balloon and in this way avoid destroying important evidence, it would be less expensive ?????
If the fbi is analyzing it... you know we will NEVER get the truth
Smells like propaganda to make it seem usa can takle this new possible enemy threat, but have no answers and are not superior above whom or whatever these so called targets are. Summerians are returning deal with it America
Journalists are given a script to follow. They feed you BS and people believe it. All of us are living The Truman Show. Wake up. The media are ALL liars.
If Aliens, with that type of intelligence you think they would just get “shot down” that easily? Highly unlikely. My guess would be china or Russia
Thier not mentioning the small aliens inside. Why not? They are not evil.there here to help our dumb asses.
UFO
I don't trust the information that the media and the government puts out, they put out what they want us to believe.
Yeah, never mind what’s going on with the chemical train derailment & conspired setting on fire in Ohio that’s hazardous to thousands of people. Look over here, we’ve got ufos , jets and the fbi. Pilots that don’t if it’s a weather balloon or Jiffy Pop popcorn aluminum foil containers dropped from the  International space station to see if they’ll pop ok upon reentry ( because that’s part of the New Green Deal to save energy). Governmental Distractions !
Biden shoots down a toy balloon but let's the China balloon go all the way across the US
Your passing off mother  nature!!!
Biden see different things too . CHINA just testing the old boy out .
If these things were alien spacecraft, there’s no way our earth technology would have a chance in hell of shooting them down. My guess is that the military staged the whole thing… I think most people on earth want peace but the military needs conflict to justify its existence. If you wanna worry about aliens, worry about the ones here on earth that would be controlling our leaders and media; not any peaceful ones observing us from a distance. Better yet, stop worrying and turn off the fucking news and then the whole fear agenda will be a bust 😁💟☮️☯️
If you want to know what the objects were, watch the UFO documentary by James Fox, "Phenomenon." The more people do the less chance they will be taken in by the kind of misinformation espoused by seasoned cover-up agents like Baer.
can't stand BS CNN so we will see the crap here quickly
I believe most pilots can tell if a ballon type structure even if unusual shape.  These did not appear as flying at high speeds or maneuvering in manners defying physics like alien craft.  They were easily shot down with no explosion like a ballon? No fires falling down to earth.  There are more freedoms for pilots to say what they really saw.  No one saying these could be alien or multidimensional craft.  Let’s see pics for public to decide.  The government after 70 years finally has stated there are things we can not explain and they are not from any countries we know.  People handle truths better than lies!
lol
Yea pls technical  because you don’t know such bs
What no close photos what BS  most likely the balloon association balloon?
When a pilot says they cannot identify something at less than 60 thousand feet they are lying.
Up up and away in a beautiful balloooo hooo hoooon.  Chiinah.
CNN your news and network suck
The powers that be must really have a low opinion of the general public, If they seriously think we are going to fall a load of tosh like that;
Watch documentary...UNACKNOWLEDGED>>>>STEVEN GREER...and close encounters of the fifth kind....zoom to big picture
FBI do not speak the truth.
Biden was watching too much Star Trek Discovery . Gave ET the Klingon welcome
As Barrack said , "If Joe can screw it up he will "  So we shoot down something with technology far superior? and now we here all the other great nuclear powers did teh same thing this year.  So number 1 , no one shot down anything , if it were a true UAP then it let us shoot it down . Pretty bizarre behavior, weather they be aliens or some subterranean sub oceanic species. they are not friendly and never have been . a friend doesn't fly around unidentified and without regard
We are not alone
Alians are real and they flies in our world thousands years!
What are they deflecting now distracting us with this bs? Always trying to fool us
look squiral
Damn. That was my extra-terrestrial Uber!  No wonder it never showed up! I was trying to move away from the terrestrial incompetence here in California.
Just say aliens are coming
Lol, oh cnn. You criticized trump for saying covid was a Chinese virus. Now you can’t call it a ballon without emphasizing it’s a ‘Chinese spy balloon’
just let them come pick me up and get me off this rock
Balloons are now banned in the USA
FBI gets involved things get murky
Government fighting themselves
Why yall lying? Karma
Biden can't do anything right. Complete incompetence.
Well thanks for the comic relief, always entertaining. Who blew up the Nord Stream pipelines and how bad is that toxic spill in Ohio?
@6:01 Has the Chinese military gone rogue? Now that is purely CNN original war mongering BS, straight from the "scare the crap out of you desk" at CNN central.
liar
@5:20 "Mach six ... made no sense at all ... shelved, couldn't figure it out" That sounds like a true story, possibly the first accurate thing you have said.
Biden lost his birthday baloon, someone is going to get spanked for this.
You wouldn't be able to come close to a real UFO they have tried to shoot them down for years! this is too funny. Too many are awake you can't fool the people any longer!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 lies lies lies. If it were a REAL UFO? They would not let you hear about it!! its all a distraction because EPSTEIN LIST IS COMING OUT ON MAIN STREAM MEDIA!!! Deep State Cabal is FINISHED!!! 💥💥💥💥💥
It was a hoax. Never existed. That is why pilots have different stories about the object; descriptions were just made up and they never agreed beforehand what to say.
Chinese balloons . Chinese balloons
@3:35 "track it back to China, Russia or wherever" Yep, they will track it back, or some high school kids will come forward and say it was their balloon.
LIES!! LIES!!! LIES!!!!!
What unidentified objects?... where are they, any photos?. The general public would so easily believe that an Alien was a turd if NASA could make it move and project voice somehow!!!
Alien conversation is to bring humor/lightheartedness into a troubling scenario which will be hidden cause the less the populace knows, the better….
@3:23 "obviously there was some sort of propulsion system" I wonder what made a complete falsehood seem "obvious" to this guy?
🐑🐑🐑 Watch this and swallow your Kool-Aid 🐑🐑🐑  Don't ask about US taking out NORDSTREAM  For sure don't ask about Epstein Island.  🐑🐑🐑 Go back to sleep 🐑🐑🐑
We will never know the truth!!!
Bob, you are killing me. @3:09 "the propulsion" It is a helium balloon with a ham radio, "the propulsion" is called wind.
why didn't they send slower planes to look at it,  before shooting it down, if the jets moved too fast.  It must have not been moving very fast.  Pretty sure, We are all being driven to distraction on this.   There are so many other, let's say "explosive toxic issues", that they don't want you to see right now.
@3:02 "too technical" Don't worry too much about that Bob, we will try to follow along with your BS. Frequency hopping, ok, yea that could be it, or it could be a ham radio.
This is nothing but a smoke screen to deflect that the US committed an act of war against a Russian pipeline. They have already confirmed one of the “UFO’S” was actually a weather ballon from Canada or US.
Let's hear from an expert, Bob the "Intelligence and Security Analyst": @3:00 "intercepting communications to that vehicle ..very difficult" Yep, very difficult, unless you have a ham radio.
Probably a probe from another dimension.
@2:20 "Chinese spy balloon" Well .... Chinese anyway.
lmao war of the worlds finna happen, fr, then aliens preparing for a rescue mission, we bout to get invaded on gang
BLAH BLAH BULLSHIT  - Roswell UFOgate. For 75 years, the American government has been lying to humanity. Also, my revolution in physics has been valid for 28 years; speak my sensational discovery and my law of 01/17/95, I discovered extraterrestrials.
@2:12 "FBI is going to be taking the lead" Those poor kids, I can just see the FBI grilling them. "Can you prove your high school ham radio project wasn't communicating with Russians or Chinese?" "Are there guns in your home?" "Do you or any member of your family believe in your second amendment rights?" "Does your family use a natural gas stove to cook their food?"
@1:59 "recover a significant amount of debris" This is why I like watching CNN, you know it is a lie, but you don't know who told it, did CNN just make that up or did the Pentagon actually tell that lie? This was a high school project balloon carrying a ham radio transmitter/repeater. The payload was less than a cubic foot and it was shot down in the arctic by a sidewinder missile; they did not recover "a significant amount of debris".
Hey jim, this time YOU miss blaming it on Trump!! Perhaps you could say you saw Trump launching it from the southern border!
"Deadhorse"- being FLOGGED !
What are they trying to distract us from paying attention to? Who blew up the Nord Stream Pipelines? Your network sucks, any true journalist would be asking those questions. I am a dick, I would pose the question like this; "Did the President use the same dive team to retrieve the "Chinese Spy Balloon" that they used to sabotage the Nord Stream Pipelines?
Lol at CNN LOL fakest news in history
Oh. The FBI is investigating. What a bunch of bullshit. Should be military alone. FBI is compromised.
Don’t know if I’ve missed it, but have they mentioned at what speed were the objects going at? Specially since it’s noted they didn’t see a propulsion system.
A balloon is a UFO or a UAP?? Neither it's a F*cking ballon. Like the POTUS!
Some kids in Ohio playing with hydrogen balloons🎈
This is more nonsense to distract from the NWO.

You think we are going to BELIEVE what you report about America's problems. It is like listening to Brandon and believing him. Hence your tanking ratings.
It a fake UFO sighting by joe Biden, there is no UFO
Nah,  the government just came out to explain that it was just swamp gas caught by the light of fireflies which were stuck to a weather baloon. Nothing to see here!
Probably just balloons full of covid 20
We could not shoot down Aliens and from what we seen with Russia doubt its them. China maybe.
Did they all see different things...?
(Giggle)
Ah yes... the lead-in to Project Blue Beam... Here it comes...
Has anybody stop to think these balloons might be filled with a poisonous gas? And while protecting our airspace, our military is releasing the gas into the atmosphere.
We don't trust the FBI let the military do it
so you open an aperture a little more, sure, and bam! you accidentally discover THE alien spy network that's been harassing all the kooks for 70 years? i guess whenever you're on the verge of a full-on legitimacy crisis, imply aliens! i can't believe yall believe this nonsense. bottom line is the sky has been full of top secret drones for decades -- duh -- and the Chinese version was embarrassing, and covering up spying for too long in a democracy turns it into a pointless little scandal. i'm sure in some backroom somewhere, we agreed since we saw theirs, we'd show them ours. all we gotta do is play dumb that we did, and only beijing will get the message to save face. they got big white ones, we got little black ones. happy? yes? moving on.
Nah we bout to have a Independence Day Fr fr
..This supposed balloon is not the only one to appear, a year ago, (in link below) exact same color, shape etc, same one basically. So why the big fuss now, blaming China without evidence, the so-called US government is rallying their citizens to go against China & Russia, we all know by now that the so-called US government wants world dominance and will do anything to get it. A huge manipulator it is. Don't be fooled.   https://youtu.be/wy7fqi9l8BI
...flood the data until it becomes unrecognizable.
For real ppl? Do not believe the hype! This is project blue beam another lie just to distract other lies that are coming to the surface. Implementing fear to keep control. Wake the heck up!!! know the agenda!!!
We all know that UFO's are here, there's nothing new about them. The question is why now suddenly they have decided to talk about it?
What are you talking about? The conversation went from shooting down an unknown object to China. No one knows what it is and where it’s from. I think we’re jumping to conclusions.
How pathetic is the Biden administration for not identifying a $12 Boy Scout balloon and using an $80 million dollar fighter to shoot it down with a $400k rocket? How incompetent are they?
Be a kids party 🎈
Don't anyhow say.  Only one balloon is Chinese.  the others are party balloons.
Just a distraction why did they shot this one down over land and not the known spy one
Wow!! I thought Acosta was long long gone!!  This is the first time I've seen his face since Trump left office!!
This is all lies. They know what it is because they put them there
Joe Biden shot down a weather balloon. But let the Chinese one fly over the United States. You go Joe. Democraps at their finest.
We see nothing. We hear nothing. We say nothing. That was informative.
We will never know the real truth… thanks to all the cover ups
"When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads for your redemption draws near."
No obvious means of propulsion? Seriously? Is it common place for people to stick jet engines on their balloons these days? These stories are seriously stretching and it just makes them sound dumb.
Stupid, hyper-suspicious & false accuser US government, congressmen, military, national security & intelligence agencies plus many US citizens saying that they were Chinese spy ballons. Today President Biden has confirmed that the 3 unidentified balloons detected by the U.S. military over three  (one over Alaska, one over Canada and the third over Lake Huron in Michigan) have no indications that the three objects shot down in North American air space are tied to China's spy balloon program and are likely from private entities.
The Aliens were here to help,  and the military shot them down without hesitation.   Now the US will lie and say it was a spy balloon, and they will keep the Alien tech for themselves and dissect the Alien bodies.  Sickening.
Seriously ? CNN ? Boy, talk about stacking the deck of misinformation !! CNN is so biased towards the current illegitimate  regime in the WH, they will eat any and all the garbage thrown at them.  I myself don't believe ANYTHING OUR GOVT SAYS ANYMORE,  and neither should you. I smell a rat, and a cover up for a FF event...
We couldn't match that advanced technology even in a thousand years! Earthlings are way behind, this could've been test to see our reactions here on this planet!! Not Good 👾👽
There's something else out there 😂 alien craft shot to smithereens by earth 🌎, wait there'll be more and they'll be back 🍷🍷
Aliens are fallen angels
As if there aren't onboard cameras recording on a 100 million dollar jet
This is the governments following a plan to convince the public aliens are here because theyre about to attack so they can use their ufo jets to use in wars and make other countries believe its aliens
welcome to project bluebeam.
They want you to think an alien invasion is coming. The great deception is coming as prophesied in the Bible. Praying that you choose Jesus over the material world.
Next up the mothership, the size of Manhattan
So while we are watching these foreign objects that we have know clue about what they are or where they come from, what are we not watching when we are watching them? Maybe it's a diversion for some other motives. Maybe they are learning something we are not watching what they are learning just watching what they want us to watch. Like they do with tictok. Theres got to be something we are missing.
Russian balloons full of novichok ☠️☠️👀
i dont know what kind of object they shut down
The crafts were zeta & arcon both bad guys . The Pleadians are glad for the help . There were more crafts shot down than reported . There is no use to look for remains , all the craft were manned & manuverable but way cruder than some E.T. craft .
Imagine believing a fighter jet can shot down a space ship with a technology that allowed some aliens to travel thousand of lightyears, through all the shit the universe can throw at you.
Hahaha it was a kids 12 dollar balloon
F35s are actually slower than the f15
Cnn just said nothing as usual
Aliens just show up already..
When CNN is saying ufos you know you need to start looking at what else is going on in the world. It's such blatant distraction techniques
Actual balloons don't have any 'propulsion system', so there's nothing to see !
They know exactly what they shot down! Wake up people! All military jets have excellent cameras on them.  They are not telling us for whatever reasons.  Don't bother waiting around for any answer either. Lol
This isnt Chinese. The CIA is hiding something from us. He even said balloons are poor methods of surveillance. He is suggesting that the PLA and Xi are not on the same page and that a military coup is happening and that covid lockdowns are somehow related to it or some shite. To me this is the rumblings of a man trying desperately to cover up something that has him shaken. He also sounds very exhausted and dissociated and irritated. I don't trust the CIO. ONE. BIT.
That was Brandon’s balloon…..he was trying to attract small children with it. That’s why we shot it down. Brandon has completely lost his mind…..time for a new president.
It’s propaganda on the US part to take you away from their crimes of war.  This is all in Behold a Pale horse.
The military is going to reverse engineer it.
Obviously aliens...
not sure who............ dont think the annunaki.........(celts are annunaki , and as hesus/anu , i had "know" ,   the nordics are more possible, need look more what sananda and ashtar tell, after 70 years, there can find a way for a fake rapture
because blinken is a vagina boy
one sure thing....we will not ever get the truth....they are still lying about JFK
Aliens? Ugh 2023 just started
What is it? Errrr we don't know. Okay let's shoot it!! Typical
More smoke screens, more cover ups. The pilots know but have been told to keep quiet.
I'm guessing this is all just smoke and mirrors to get us away from the Biden documents and hunter.
Independence Day but on ice 😂
hahaha aliens that managed to come all the way from the far side of the universe, can be shot down by our cavemen technology... hahahaha
They're mapping the area so they can use missiles
4:30 mark he turned on the mentioning of Chinese balloons pay attention
Uh...balloons don't need a method of propulsion idiots. You would think everybody on the planet with at least 2 functioning brain cells knows that.
China exposing how vulnerable we are. This president can’t secure the southern border or our air space! Can we imagine all the noise from CNN if Trump was in office and all this infiltration of our air space happened. They would blame it all on him after calling him vile names. How many billions did Biden get from China?
Can we not capture one, its a fuckin balloon
BS
What he says it's odd; I thought the CIA was very much inside China and aware of anything happening in that country.
Wasn't any way to capture the object instead of shooting it down?
Remember about the List, Biden Laptop ukraine
there are many ufo incidents relating to war because when usa was testing nuclear bombs many people saw ufo's.
Orson Welles War of the Worlds CNN on Dianabol LSD psychosis
CAN WE ALL SAY ALIENS  TOGETHER 🇺🇸👽 UFOS are here or maybe they have been here right along 🤔  China's probably in on it  with the aliens 👽
We don’t believe you .. fake news why would pilot be giving statements
No camara or something recording before they shot it down really its 2023 we have the technology.
So, they're still going with these Chinese balloon stories, huh?
IF the military knows what the objects are, they are certainly NOT going to tell the American public.  They will concoct some story like swamp gas, ball lightning, migratory bird flock, etc., but, they will NEVER TELL THE TRUTH.
Misdirection the world is one big joke 😂
im actually listening to acosta..  sad 1st quarter of the year for me
I'm not even going to say it
Worrying about spy ballons when nations been spying on eachother since forever..And be more concerned about the device in your hand you film this footage on..that's a big spy tool you carry happily for the government to spy on you...
they should let 5 th graders investigate i dont feel that the fbi is capable
I swear I can see the future I know where this is going this is going to end the whole Pentagon opening up a investigation including NASA ufo “team”. Why ? How? Because we have one of the things and t’s just a very kool man made drone nothing to think about , just don’t forget to keep them out are air space and inside parks and everything will be fine😂 😂😂 the end
Dude like wtf!!!
But the president and white house said they have not recovered anything. Gov might as well be the devil because they can never tell the truth
CNN IS SO PATHETIC IT'S A SPY CRAFT FROM ONE OF OUR EMENIES. HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE
Does this mean we'll now be engaging "tic-,tac's'" and unidentified contacts such as the "gimble"ufo depicted in Navy gun camera footage?  We haven't ruled our skies FOR DECADES, perhaps ,60+ years or more, IF EVER!
It was going mach 6,  we don't know or care lol
Biden destroyed Nordstream 2 pipeline moving the world closer to WWIII thanks Biden.
Don’t be mad when that Independence Day mothership shows up.
This is like a squirrel hunter shooting at anything that moves,  you shot down a object you have no idea what it was?  So why did you shoot it if you have no idea what it is?  Aren't you supposed to wait until sunlight to shoot at things and not just at movement.
Biden can't be honest he's a liar with communist ties.
What ever they are, they will never give us the truth.
technology advancing.
3:20 it’s a balloon , they float!🎈 What a joke!😂😂😂 It was wind powered!
Stop shooting our kids birthday balloons!🎈 Talk about them now admitting they shot down America’s own weather balloons 🎈 over USA and Canada. Lake Huron balloon was so tough they had to shoot 2 missiles 🛩🚀🚀🎈🔥😅
This distraction story was shot down faster than monkey 🐵 pox 😂  Msm hid the Ohio train 🚂🔥🔥🔥☢️disaster for a week. Also,  breaking news on proof who blew up. Nordstream, plus Epstein list of clients is is the news
It will be another weather balloon
It appears that they're testing multiple devices to see which takes longest for the US to detect, with a view to expanding their usage.
, could be a biological chemical release object #BCO
Election coming up, I know what time it is! 🤣
The hole world is against us
Sounds like Roswell over Alaska you're never going to get a straight answer remember Roswell was supposed to be a weather balloon way back then
Yes they pulling are tail.usa
Know one were in there.daw
They blew it all up.good luck
It's china.not aliens.they got y'all confused not me
The american goverment will cover this up if these are e.t simply saying that one min they are cylinder shaped,then octagonal and as of 17th feb biden now say's ballons,so which is it seems like they know already but will hurry to hush it up to avoid public panic.If they found these objects which i bet they have and if alien they will want to harness every bit of info and tech from them as this could give the military a upper hand in a conflict,so we will never know what they really are.
Do y'all know all countries have flying cars.this is a fact.
I refuse to believe anything until the official denial is released.
They're Saiyans.....
Natasha Bertrand, huh? Smart young woman and well spoken. Hope we see her climb to the summit of her chosen field.
Where are the videos or pictures to prove this  at  ?    telling stories means nothing without proof   . I have a penthouse on the moon too .
Even if they know they won't tell
Our government made bad deals with "demonic aliens in the 50s. Under greada treaty. ⚠️👁🦎" after being warned by more benevolent collectives not to .  They got technology but sold us out and lied to us. ..that is why what you are saying is accurate lol ironically   Our top institutions and industry are a lie. We are lower dimensional pawns being messed with.   But the nicer ones are coming back. Ie the seeders. So it should get better if humans can remain peaceful and become more aware.
Nothing in the vid actually shows “pilots” accounts … this is what Trump meant by fake news
It is not UFO, it is matter of fact Chinese Flying Object (CFO), and almost every business have it but they are not flying.
"It is flying"
It's a probe come on get real
Took any pictures?
I'm sure the fighter jets can take 8k videos and crystal clear photos why aren't they showing them ?
This country keeps to many secrets from it's own people so we're doe's the pledge of a allegiance comes in play again 🤔😂get ready folks were all going to die
What if it WAS aliens and they shot it down. The other aliens could come back PISSED. We didn’t even get a say in this
How about showing us the videos they took  and who do those old bats think they are that they can keep this info from American citizens ,they know what they saw
Aliens obviously
PULEASE srfup about balloons…..let the USA do their due diligent duty…STOP TRYING TO GET RATINGS…YOU’RE LOSING BY DOING THIS,
Doctored
America is stupid China just declared war with our country Now it's time for us to retaliate against them cyber warfare
In August of 2020...I was on an early morning walk...it was just before sun rise... I saw an object that at first looked like a black trash bag caught in an up draft... Triangular..it flowed the road ..and then drifted higher... have to wonder 🤔
Do ya really think the military gonna send pilots who they cant control??🤦‍♂️🤣🤣🤣anythin the pilots say is what gov told them2say🤮🤮
This is a look over here at the "ufo",  instead of over there where we're doing some corrupt ass shit, situation. All brought to you by our illigintment, Democratic run, Federal government.
Unidentified Spy  Chinese balloons
Slowly bringing in it now to the masses , Optimus prime is here
If you can shoot it down, it is probably not alien.
Project Blu beam 😂
Rumours have it the UFO was coming to pick up Justin Trudolph the space cadet
Clinton Network News ,  are a bunch of liars , just like msnbc, and most others.   I don't believe what the gov't tells us  !
I guess these modern aircraft don’t have videoing capabilities like I’ve seen in other fighter jet videos  following objects! 🤔
Look, I'm not saying it was Aliens but,  it was Aliens..
Lies lies lies lies and then lie some more
China ? Russia?  Cmon .stop the BS.
Fake news as usual
Well leave it to humanity to shoot down something minding its own business, I know that the news has been terrible and they are getting what they want us to do is to fight with each other we need to always remember that could be your own child in a air craft he made in his garage and didn’t think that he would be killed for being a inventor trying to take the planet into the golden age of knowledge and technology and improving life on this planet for all of gods creation every human every dog and even the frogs we all live on this Little Rock that is flying threw space at a speed that can’t be comprehend or even compared to anything on this planet. It could just be me but it’s never a good idea to ask questions after you hurt someone or something we as humans should assume that love for life and love for ones own loved ones does not look at another creation with fear and ill will, but looks at the unknown with mystery and wonder of the world and excitement to the possibilities of gods world, patience is something that is never easy just waiting on something or someone to explain itself to you. I always forget what makes me so special that they should let me know what they are doing. This is a free world I have always been led to believe but could be wrong. But I never looked into my neighbors yard and got mad or upset or fearful that they didn’t ask me if it was ok if they cut the grass or built airplane’s or weather balloons, it is a horrible feeling finding out that I wasn’t picked or asked to help i might like weather balloons to but that feeling of not belonging is a far cry from shooting there weather balloon down and then say we’ll it was at 40,000 feet with out a plain in sight in the middle of nowhere over a practically unpopulated forest. I’m just saying I would be writing checks and bending over backwards and praying that it was unmanned unlikely but still praying for forgiveness and the wronged party accepted my apologies and was understanding of my ignorance and fear and work together for a better tomorrow . What ever it was was a tragedy no matter what time of the day, year or decade. We live in a eye for a eye world, but that just makes everyone blind and still fearful. And if you think about it if you were blind in the first place you never would have seen it in the first place. I want to look up and see something I haven’t seen before and then ask if I can look under the hood or can you build me one and I have them look at me with respect and dignity and see the curiosity of god’s world shining through my eyes my heart and soul truly encouraging innovation invention and inventors whatever it was I know it was this for sure god knew it was there and no doubt  that it would be shoot out of the sky. It’s what we do next that’s important and why history keeps repeating itself over and over. An eye for an eye leaves everyone blind but then again I guess no one would of seen the weather balloon.
CNN   😂😂😂
Think of the children
I call bs...
If any of these craft were Extraterestial our World could be in a Whole lot of trouble.
If its aliens..then what?
More mysterious like the excess deaths? Yet no reporting on that. So what's happening in Ukraine then? Russia winning?
U.S. GOVERNMENT :LOOK AT MY LEFT HAN-..I MEAN THE UFO'S WE SHOT DOWN...
At some point Aliens will make a worldwide show of themselves and the government will no longer be able to hold the LIE anymore.
He said one of the unidentified objects he has seen in his career was going MACH 6...let that sink in. And they bury the facts deep somewhere but the truth IS OUT THERE. we need to go get it
Says alot to me that when the 1st balloon was shot down they were quick to show pictures of it afterwards and were all open about it. This time no pictures? Silence? Hmmmmmm they are lying about something and I think it’s a UFO
UFOS 👽 are here
Seriously? China making aggressive move against their number one customer? China's leader fixing to get booted out and so is Brandon. Brandon Administration is colluding with China and priming  everybody for another political war so they can stay in office another term. China using 1920s Technologies to spy on America? Really? Come on man! Let's leave Hollywood and come back to America people.DAMN!°
reporter asking some good questions? And the FBI  YEAH IS CHINA OR RUSSIA!! Keeps ignoring unknown objects or ufo
It seems like China is setting off international trouble while we're visiting. First the spy balloon, then lasers pointing at the crew of patrol boats with the intention of blinding them in their own waters
Frequency hopping... Smells like bull shi*
Americans need to be afraid of their own government, not from some aliens.
99.99% chance a drone. 0.01% chance an alien.
Where the f!!! The video
"Did not appear to be self-maneuvering" ... what? If it was a balloon, it would be drifting downwind aimlessly at the same speed and direction as the prevailing winds. If was moving in any direction other than the prevailing winds or moving at a speed in excess of the prevailing winds, it would certainly be considered self-maneuvering or maneuvering under remote control unless tethered to some other moving object.  I find it hard to believe trained Air Force pilots cannot accurately describe a target nor were they instructed to close the gap and ascertain what kind of an object they pursuing. FLIR and other Military Imaging equipment are effective from multiple kilometers away.
Chinese Chinese Chinese
Sounds warfare is real ! Antigravity is real I saw it raining backwards!! The aircraft is black no heat signature 🙈 I have seen it!! And I am not the only one! I have a witness! Talk to me! 👽💩???
Maybe ask the questions to pilots to describe how the object looked..
ET go home, or crazy Joe will shoot you down.
How gullible does the military industrial complex and News Media think we all are? Why would China, Russia, or any Country for that matter have one of their "Surveillance Balloons" shot down and then intentially send 3 more unidentified objects with no propolsions knowing they will only get shot down.  To Provoke us? Really? This is a load of Hockey Dung. Why would these Pilots being talking about a classified Mission with the general public? Is this yet another distraction? Is this part of disclosing to the public the truth about UFO's? Does the Military Industrial Complex need another 500 billlion to save us from Aliens? There is an agenda here by the dark top top secret parts of the government. It's right out of the same playbook they have been playing since World War 2 and the general public is catching on.
If the government thinks we are just going to forget about this they are very wrong. The American people are not that stupid and are done being lied to. The cat is out of the bag, why erode trust and invite conspiracies by lying? Just tell us the truth!! The fallout from trying to cover this up will be the straw the breaks the camels back. Trust in institutions is so low right now the country literally cannot afford another massive cover up.
What if since they've been devoloping fighter jets, they're just testing ours?
Why watch at all.. we'll never be told what is really going on.
Each missile shot costs $400,000 . That's like shooting a 3 bdr house 🏠 at a cheap ballon 🎈
Shouldn't be shooting down aliens if that's truly what they are. We will never know but shooting down a highly intelligent piece of technology with highly intelligent life possibly will be a nice way to provoke a war with a space civilization that will make us there slaves. We wouldn't stand a chance!
Funny how the pilots don’t take any photos, or if they did, that no pictures have been shared with the public.
The countries involved in these shootings are not at a state of war with anyone. There is a code they're using that we're allowing to be used that they feel justifies their violent actions. Is up to us to question and demand piece.
Antarctica is the key!!! That will open all doors and answer all questions
I find it a bit suspicious that I can't seem to contact my hillbillie cousin since that day, last I heard from him he said he was going to strap 2 weather balloons to his lawn chair and cooler box🤔🤔
Show video evidence from the pilots!! Than yo can talk about intelligently. A mirky news.
Few if any weather balloons have solar panels and its unlikely a weather balloon with solar panels as large as balloon 1  had is a weather balloon.  Based on panel size and considering  charging power reserves, the panels were powering several hundred watts of equipment which would be highly unusual unless it was capturing massive amounts of data in the form of photos and more importantly low energy radio signals.   Radio signals from microcontrollers, closed networks, and point-to-point networks can not be easily captured by satellites but would be key to understanding and attacking infrastructure.   It is also likely that the balloon was interrogating and attacking the encryption of low power data stations and APs.   These closed, low power, and poiint-to-point radios are the second oe third greatest threat to US infrastructure, and many are protected by weak encryption and obsurity.   It is also likely that control of said balloon and data collection were shared duties of remote and local (Chicoms on the ground) operators and data collectors.   Even if this balloon was fake, the infrastructure weakness exists, and balloons are unique attack vectors that should mot be dismissed.   Profiling, war driving, and pentesting data systems and radio communications  via high altitude balloons is a very interesting idea and again, would produce data and results, not otherwise available on such a large scale.
I don't believe anything CNN has to report!
Does anyone really believe earth has the capability to shoot down a craft designed to travel through light years of space and survived all the asteroid debris they would surely have hit during their flight to backwards earth?
$10 UFO just took out a Blackhawk, their fighting back🤣🤣🤣
Very weldone US pilot 👩‍✈️👌👌👌👍👍👍💖
*Project Blue Beam People* 💯 our government will soon become 1
Look for arrows printed in the plastic
@2:15, Natasha said, "just last week, we saw that another Chinese spy balloon. Another, I should say a Chinese spy balloon, because we don't know what this one actually is." How amazing. How can you say it was a Chinese spy balloon if you don't know what it actually is? More amazing was when I turned around the folks in the room if they spotted any anomaly in her speech, and no one did until I rewind the vid and pointed it out them. Then they all exclaimed "Ah ..." No wonder the country's been going downhill. The population is teeming with the dumb and dumber. So sad.
The pilots have been compromised. Maybe they are a part of a clandestine organization that is aware of alien life here....
That's because the American military is worthless and weak.
Honestly can't believe that goverment think people world so fuckin dumb that can TEY MAKE OUT THIS SOME SORT ALIEN CRAFT CAUSE LETS FACE IT THIS WHAT TRYIN DO HERE .. RATHER SAY THAT WAS ANOTHER FUCKIN BALLON .. HONESTLY .. THERE IS DEADLY WAR GOING ON AND WORLD IS ON EDGE IF ERUPTING INTO WW3 AND THESE FUCKING GOVERMENT IDIOTS WANT US BELIEVE THAT THIS IS FUCKIN (E.T )
FAKE NEWS!!!!! 🛸
Where is the Epstein list?
once upon a time Donald Trumps era could make friends with enermies and build broken bridges less war in the world  assumption assumption will destroy earth
This is a Perfect Storm!
If the pilots couldn't identify what it was....why am I watching this video.
The aliens are coming guys!  Government is preparing the people!.....or you know this is a very convenient distraction from all the bullshit and cuckery going on the world stage.
Dont believe a word they say. CNN cannot be trusted
The US government will lie about this topic to their graves. We'll never know unless some intervention happens somewhere.
Sooooo.  No news on what’s going on in Ohio?   Just the fake ufos is what cnn was told to report on?   How ironic it’s directly after Biden failed to shoot the 1st balloon down.   Seen this coming.   Democrats are predictable
This shiz is priceless.....
Definitely can Not count on the media , especially CNN Liars, to tell the public the truth . Our government and mainstream media is more far more dangerous than potential "aliens".
Couldn't tell how it was staying in the air?  Wasn't it a balloon?
Oh let’s find a common enemy …….. oh look a Alien !
Surprised cnn didnt blame Trump
The global entity has had anti gravity technology for decades. If UFOs are scene at this point in time then they are from human beings due to the aggressive pursuit of one world government creation. Timing is everything. To have aliens come at this point in time would be millions to one. Research Bob Lazar and go to Witness Testimony UFO https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLheQsaGhkwP8RnnlYI636corqr1rLy7Tu
Bob lazar tried to tell y’all
I don't hear any pilots saying it was a balloon. And if the are looking for a propulsion mechanism, then it was moving? Not a balloon and moving inexplicably is pretty weird.
Who the hell is this woman? She's an actor! She knows very well what the object is, she is following the script ,raise the fear and drama!!
Surprised they didn't say coneheads 🤪
More BS
Just show the fighter plane video recording stop all this guessing
The payload was high for a spy balloon as well as a weather balloon. I don't think anyone is considering that the China is very interested in all the oil and gas plus minerials in the artic. These types of balloons can detect where these deposits are and why China is so angered. We have Alaska and Russia has been building and of course China believes all belongs to them anyway food for thought.
Copied from twitter Not only is this administration filled with the most incompetent humans on the planet, it's almost as if they sought out the worst of the worst. I mean seriously, KJP, Buttigieg, Harris, Mayorkas - the list goes on.
THEY / US PILOTS / MILITARY WILL NEVER SPEAK THE TRUTH REGARDING ANY POSSIBLE THREATS TO AMERICA. THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL INFORMATION AND THEY WILL SPEAK WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO RELAY. JUST PRAY AND STAY CLOSE TO YOUR KIDS / FAMILY. DO NOT SPREAD OUT, AND STAY CLOSE TO YOUR FAMILY I CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH UNTIL YOU / WE HEAR DECENT NEWS THAT IS SOMEWHAT COMFORTING
WHO CARES!!
Democrats are you farming for Mushroom Clouds.? Seems so
Keep your eye on the prize . thats funny when they cant tell the same lie the same thats when you know your being lied to .the fbi will know what to do 👍they are very good at telling a lie or two or 3 or how ever many they need to
80% of Americans are on drugs. Just let that sink in before you start getting paranoid about UFOS
Is communist network news trying to redeem themselves? If so, keep up the good work...we'll accept the truth, but fake is a no-go.
Why would they shoot something down before even identifying what it is? I call bs
They are just setting up the stage for a hoax deception. Imagine the technology that we don't know about. Be vigil .
It’s not extraterrestrial life but we don’t know what the object is 😂
There are no UFO's just Chuck Norris playing with frisbee
everyone is ready for aliens just fkin tell us
Why does alien are only in America 🤣🤣
I see a lot of chat about UFOs and not a lot of chat about Jeffrey Epstein's list being released
Bulshittttt...
If CNN is involved, they're in with the miscommunication, misinformation,& attention diversion,if what is really going on in this country! It's all bullshit!
explain the truth dont just make shit up to sound good
F35 or F22
The alien is located in the white house....
us air force is just making things up just like the fake moon landing...
Pay no attention to the Hunter Biden laptop.   UFOs.   Look over there.
These UFOs are the new drama. Just wonder what they are hiding from you. This should not be breaking news or deserves this coverage. Cover the pipelines, cover China aggression, cover all things USA and no more secrets. Stop it
This is CNN News, is it the Truth or made up News? Again it's CNN News, Making The Air Force Pilots look  Incompetent, when the best trained in the World, The Best Military all Branches in the World, It's CNN News,
Why they are not releasing videos of fighter planes ???
More questions than awnsers lol must suck that nobody trusts cnn anymore.
VERY INTERESTING ^^
What the actual F
Then we will discover these ufo 👽 were us made lol
It’s a great way to just test how long it takes the brainless Us administration to shoot the thing down. It could be an emp, or could be dropping ticks with diseases that could wipe us out. Why would America let it fly across America? It seems our current admin wants to destroy America. I’ve seen Chinese drones fly over the us at night for years
How is this possible if there’s space station and thousands of satellites  flying around the earth how can anything come in to earth with detecting it from space station and satellite people are so stupid and why is it always in super powers country that these aliens flys over africa is big Europe is big oceans is huge but nah it’s always Chinese or america people don’t use they’re minds some of us are in a strings all governments on earth are the devils
Deflect, deflect, deflect.  Look over here! We have Lucky Charms in the sky folks! Let's talk about the elephant in the room....the US bombing the pipeline, freezing out our fellow German humans and causing the largest ecological disaster that is more than 200 years combined of all pollution and cow farts. Where is the outcry from the climate change folks?! 🤔
It's not enough we start war with each other however now we're starting war with aliens😏😏😏😏
Help Syria
It landed on ice from 40000ft,? How thick ice do you have?. The alien fake infasion to create 1 world gov cospiracy theory might become reality 🤣
False flag! False flag! Ridiculous
I'm sure 👽 blew up north stream pipeline:-)))
How does Jim Acosta still have a job? What a POS
I believed in aliens until MSM started reporting on it.
And we still don't have a cure for cancer
So the biden admin would rather pretend it's aliens than admit it's the Chinese again 🙄
So they found it or didn’t find it?? I’m confused I thought they couldn’t find the ufo they shot down on the Canadian border. How are they gonna see where it came from or what it’s made of if they “never found it”
Yes I'd like to make a comment this is my channel and my name I'm real I'm real as it gets as far as the internet and disclosure is concerned. I have proof that the software technology that goes into every single cell phone tower as well as possibly the land rights of those cell phone towers. CHINA.  Our telecommunications and internet grid is compromisable easily by mostly only one country chinA. They could flip a switch on our social technology requirements. AMD create propaganda and possibly attack and invade EMP consistent rotating (dipolatrizing)- which I theorized pre wind turbine reverse polarity gen.  dc electro magnetic fields (EMF) could and can levitate objects or objects tethered to gas bladders. He's rt it's facsinating
They don’t know anything.
until they can control the situation. they ll show you or tell you nothing real.  the only way we will ever know something is trough the Aliens them selves. and the gov loosing control completely
Chinese US spy balloons brought to you by Pfizer. Get your shot, it’ll save you from The Chinese US Alien spy balloon ufo thingy. This isn’t news. It’s more b.s. put out by Conman Negligent News. This network lies so often it’s basically just a soap opera series at this point.
Well if it is aliens I hope to God they can fix our country and get rid of our government
Need a proper proof & validation to rectify whatever the rumours surface pertaining to the UFO 👽 or a car size small flying object  shot down by the US air force subsequently where did the wreckage fall this is the question to be answered
🙏🏿
Misdirection.
ET SHOT DOWN WHEN GOING HOME!
its has to be China or Russia...u mean it cant be some one else? These idiots always pointing to China or Russia...what about a university or a weather research from ur own f#@king country ?
She’s a good reporter
Aircraft don't need a propulsion system to stay in the air cause electricity is in the air it don't run through wires Nicola Tesla had it patent , along withe electric cars, they set back earth about 100 years not listening to Nicola Tesla
I’m more worried about people aliens no
Us Goverment is forced on Discloure by the ET
America shouldn't shoot down all these UFO's.  This may be considered a declaration of war by the Aliens, and they may have weapons that are superior and more deadly than what we have.
And with all our tech, not one photo for the last three objects?
Components.  😢😂❤🎉🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😃
If it's alien, we just shot it down. That could be a declaration of war on an alien civilization.
Go to Canadian prepper on youtube. Nate explains what China is doing from a resource. Sounds ligit
They covered “aliens” more than what happened in Ohio. It’s bad, really bad. Credibility is not something that can last forever
And they say Christians are delusional.
There is no threat. This is distractive propaganda.
I trust nothing coming from mainstream media or our corrupt government. Terrible times
😂😂😂😂😂😂
What about Hunter Biden' laptop?
Another NASA production research operation paperclip
Simple bio weapon delivery systems if they wanted.
The Chinese balloon was an errant balloon, and the US government is trying to stir up anti-China hysteria to distract and create a bogeyman for political purposes.  That’s all there is to it.
NEXT TIME WE GOING TO SHOOT DOWN OUR DEATH WISH..
Like I'd believe anything coming from CNN? Smh  should change CNN name to LIE.
I can't believe that you will juat shoot down something you don't know or unidentified. It feels like you saw something in your property you don't know what it is but you shoot it down blindly. It doesn't make any sense. What if it was meant to be shoot so that what ever it carries will be releassd?
East Palestine, Ohio, is in the throes of an ecological disaster as authorities blew up train derailment cars carrying dangerous chemicals and the press is being arrested for trying to break the story.  Oh, but the UFOs!  What's going on?
Hahahaa 😹
Bobbear in Spanish
" ALIENS 👽👽
Sounds like a lot of bs news need to distract everyone from something else actually important
"another Chinese spy balloon..."  Then she realizes she's an idiot.
They are lying to you.
Didn't shoot down nothing  kap
Hogwash
Well congratulation to the US,  The American has successfully convinced China that the war with the US is unavoidable and inevitable.  It is either you or me...both cannot co-exist. If you look at their behavior,  they also got convinced that America wants to destroy China. You can see year by year that both sides will be more aggressive. I hope I am wrong on this. When the war mindset is in motion, it is hard to put the genie in the bottle. it looks like WW3 is coming fast and billions will die..... when that happens, humanity and  human civilization will perished.
Another bullshit story
Americans are so gullible
It's a wonderful distraction. Why can't we see it for what it so obviously is? Credit MSM propaganda, half-truths, lies by commission & omission. I tell you it's more than sad.
US must get real serious with China
Okay but what’s up with eggs
People need to wakeup. Jesus Christ has shown 1000s of Christians via dreams & visions (including me) that Russia & China are going to nuke and then invade the US by sea, air, and land because we haven't repented of our sin.
It could be something such as biological warfare that may not be able to be realized until much later. Maybe the 1st below was a test to see the US will shoot it down. Now they know our response and can use it to purposefully get things shot down for their advantage.
Jesus is returning soon to rapture those who believe in Him and follow his commandments.  WHEN PEOPLE DISAPPEAR FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, YOUNG AND OLD, AND THERE ARE NO YOUNG CHILDREN OR BABIES, YOU KNOW THAT JESUS IS REAL. YOUR ONLY HOPE THEN IS TO BELIEVE IN JESUS AND ASK JESUS TO FORGIVE YOU OF YOUR SINS. IF YOUR READING THIS NOW BEFORE THE RAPTURE, IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS. JUST BELIEVE THAT JESUS DIED ON THE CROSS FOR YOUR SINS, AND ASK JESUS TO COME INTO YOUR HEARTS "For whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved" (Romans 10:13 NKJV). "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:9 NKJV).  John 3:16 "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."  DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ALIENS, BECAUSE, IT WAS NOT!!  JESUS IS REAL AND HE TRULY LOVES YOU❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It’s the latest Scare Campaign brought to you by your friendly government and watch they’re gonna come up with a pandemic brought to you by aliens. They think more people are gonna take the clot shot this time
Why would they not take photos to show to the public..
The "magicians" are up to something. They have everyone's attention on these supposedly UFOs being shot down,when 1 yr ago they wouldn't even acknowledge these craft existed. But pay attention to this hand while the other is doing something. Theyer up to something BIG if they're willing to talk about this subject. Also you can't tell me that they can't find the wreckage. These are the same assholes who know everything that goes on in this country and you don't know where the thing is you shot down,come on.😏
its russia using chinese tech in order to confuse us
"there are so many questions out there" and we cannot answer any of them!!!
Oh gawd, the FBI?  Wasn’t this shot down over Canada?  Or was that the other one
They are coming out of the Hollow Earth
Cooooool… Wait did we shoot down the “Tic-Tac” thing? Or is this a different object?
Maybe an alien flying saucer from the planet Octavia!
It's hard to believe it was a ufo ..for years we have seen videos of our fastest jets that couldn't even keep up with a ufo much less to knock it out of the sky. Its all a bs made up
Independence day mother truckers 👽
Maybe stop shooting first? If it’s actual UFO
Ain’t no way it was Alien, cause I’m sure our weapons would be useless against them…🛸👽
Remember, if you don't know what you saw, don't say you know what you saw
The aliens are here
Cool man, what about ohio
Yah suuuuuuuuurrrreeeeeeee! Pilots ain't saying shit . The Said it was a pencil ✏️.. lol
One pilot didn't get the memo
The govt lies to the people, hides the truth from the people, kills it’s own people, uses our tax dollars on “THEIR” best interests which is conflict and greed. Yet we still don’t care and the moment we do we get muted/killed for “going against them”
They must had made the decision to attack and collect more.
They can’t even get it straight like it’s all made up BS
All of this BS is a distraction from the Hunter Biden and Twitter stories.
Do any of the 11 people watching believe these propagandists ?
If they are aliens please take me with you, earth has become a planet full of idiots
Every day I am more amazed by the stupidity of the human race
Okay, I'll admit it.  It was my balloon.
When it’s an actual UFO aircraft the media calls it a weather balloon. When it’s an actual weather balloon, media calls it a UFO. This whole story is filled with hot air, just like the balloons their shooting down during a controversial war in Ukraine that everyone wants to be stopped. Think pple. WE ARE THE THREAT, NOT CHINA. N our government keeps distracting us from the actual issues. Don’t look up, look directly at DC. Our tax money is being used so well, to kill pple with no accountability.
Being our American political system is full of shit most likely they are just trying to distract the American people with something else while they do other bullshit
Time to reopen Project Bluebook!!
If the government want tell us about them they will show themselves to us
Chinese balloons guys😑😑😑thats the best yall can do huh🤣🤣🤣🤣yall tell the world anything but guess what! Its some that are woken up by God so…haha…you do the math
UFO shot down......crashes on the ice.....military forces scramble to collect debris. Yeah play the X files music.
This actually makes sense. Pilots this is what we want you to tell the media and then they give them multiple conflicting and different stories so we have no idea what to believe.
Project Bluebeam
The owners of those UFO’s know y’all. They know you have lied, stolen & killed your way to power. They are decoys. When the real ones show up you will be powerless. They are here for us finally & you and all yr minions will pay for your evil. Finally
I don't see what the big deal is... It's obviously just more harmless aliens. Big deal.
US says on china as well
Lol omg CNN. But ok.
Aliens, cover up for something that the government doesn't want people to know
Didn't China admitted that the spy balloon is theirs? That's why they reacted when the object was shot down 🤔🤨😼
I find it hard to believe they shot down a balloon from China , describe it and its components.  And now shoot down 3 more objects and can't or won't describe or talk about any of the last 3 objects.  Sounds like ANOTHER Cover Up / LIE. Roswell  Kennedy  Watergate  Vietnam  Civil War  Pearl Harbor  Read my lips 2020 election  Don't piss down my leg and tell me it's raining.
I think Joe Biden is wanting to get our minds off of something big  thats going on or they've got planned. Now let's get our minds off of flying saucers and get our minds on Joe Biden
Breaking news They shot down my son's kite. And man is he pissed.
You're right Annie, it's part of the poisoning of the minds of people to think bad things about China.The mercantile establishment is losing money because China is more effective than they are.So! It's about trade. It's a beginning of a trade-war.🤫
Natasha 👀 hello !
Now I know why I never watch cnn
A large number of countries launch scientific balloons, weather and atmospheric data collection (i.e pollution).. all have a "payload"; data being retrieved from different scientific groups around the globe.  Most would have a dangling reflector mainly for passing through commercial airspace. I am guessing that many today would incorporate a self deflate to ensure they don't drop on populated zones.   I can remember when I was young that it was common to find weather balloons as they were regularly launched.    I imagine a number of these will now get shot down.  Best to be open on what has been found.  If it was intended to view e.g. Ukrainian lines or U.S. bases. the payload would confirm surveillance.
balon..next is UFO...😁😄 we believe its dart vader..😁.....usa being comedian as a zelensky🙃
its all a false flag
All this is or should be classified
Do not trust the government!!! THEY ARE NOT YOUR FRIEND!!
Woooow!! We will never get the truth!!!
scam dumbest don't fall for this crap oh the FBI thats funny.
That new norad radar can finally see these alien space craft. Shooting them down is a bad idea
It came from China. They already admitted as much as they are threatening the USA with retaliation. F**K the Communist Chinese.
Cant believe anyone believes this bozo !  Acosta your FIRRRRRRRED!
Bla ,bla bla. Nohing here.
We couldn't hit a UFO with even luck on our side! Get real people
Load of rubbish Hollywood bullshit
Lets say there are many advanced type 2 and type 3 civilisations in our home galaxy.. and just like our own civilisation in the near future, even type 1 is already able to send conventional exploration probes to closest solar systems around..and these definitely dont have any defence systems and it would be actually easy to shot them down. But you cant expect from governments that they will say single word. Mankind is still not prepared for such a knowledge..even in Merrica where 70% of ppl  still believe that our planet was created five thousand years ago by the bearded grandpa sitting on the cloud
Why is the US Government diverting the publics' attention to helium baloons now? So that no one talks about them blowing up the Nordstream pipelines? or the war in Ukraine? or something else,maybe?
To  cover up  Ohio Derailment Accident，The balloon has been going on why now?
We are being treated like dumb, frightened children! We want answers, not just a bunch of ifs and maybes! This whole administration is getting weirder and weirder by the minute! You people know exactly what you have there but you aren’t being transparent. If you need help identifying this stuff then let me have a crack at it. Sheesh, what a bunch of crap!
Wow, another example of why modern media sucks. Radar can't really see objects smaller than a car. Pilots are going to give conflicting, or no reports because classified. Lastly, CNN is not going to figure out shit prior to the DoD. So maybe wait for more info instead of filling up an hour of television with non sense and speculation.   Why is the world so stupid lately!?
Where’s the footage from the target camera?
Drones.  EZ PEZY.
We can see a needle in a haystack from space and we are being gaslighted with this BS? Disgusting! China owns our elite..we are screwed.
It's all a lie
They had the pilots look at the Neuralyzer and now they don't remember what they saw
Living isn't living anymore. Surviving is getting REAL my friends. 😭
If they are aliens why are they flying over North America? Are they concerned that a nuclear war is on the horizon? Why are they not flying over Russia or China then?
The government says nothing: WHY ARE THEY SO SECRETIVE?? The government makes everything public: WHY IS IT SO EXTREMELY PUBLIC??
Government Keeping it from us bc it was a ufo!
putin has asked china to do his recon
Biden: “Oh yeah guys that looks like an ali… Ooo ice cream” 🤤
Calm down. I've been flying ufos over Alaska for thousands of years.
Not everything is China… there have been these siting s for hundreds of years why are we ignoring this..
So we’re just gonna act like we’re not being invaded by aliens ?
If it's something on the more exotic end of the UAP spectrum, there is no way we are shooting it down unless it's supposed to be shot down. To understand my point, check out the incident that happened near Tehran in September of 1976, for example. These recent incidents strike me as nothing more than a show for critics and opponents (foreign and domestic) of the Biden administration.
Hey what about those Lakers?
We are not alone,norad is spying on us..along with the nsa,etc.we will never be left alone.
You mean to tell me these million dollar aircraft don’t have cameras?
They better tell us what it is
They shot it down right so they should tell us bet there gonna say weather balloon
Oh. The FBI is taking the lead in iinvestigating the object. I feel better already.
CNN stroking the gullible on a daily basis…🤣
🤣🤣 Jokers! Took a whole week to shoot down a balloon, and now this? Laughable! Where is the photo?
I dont think its tge chinese load of shit lolol
Sooo...where's that list from Epstein's Island? 🧐🤔 Nevermind this!
There were literally thousands of planes lost from canada and when US planes were called in and were unable to shoot it down until it returned to the ocean . No ships sent were seen after disappeariing
China is the least of our problems
Interfering with the sensors...That doesn't even make sense. There's no way the F-35's suite is blind. Who cares what the pilots say. Review the data.
Do democrats take any responsibility for turn no gun zones into safe places for criminals to commit murder?
Wait he still works at CLOWN NEWS NETWORK?
Not many balloons can toddle along at mach 6, even downhill with a tail wind ...
Does anyone watch CNN?  Only YouTube would allow CNN but pull down Project Veritas regarding Pfizer misconduct.
they shot missiles at the ballons and the ballons exploded? WHY DID THEY NOT JUST SHOOT BULLETS TO MAKE HOLES IN THEM THEY WOULD HAVE DEFLATED AND COME DOWN SLOWLY IN ONE PIECE..
As soon as it entered America's economic zone it should have been splashed .
UAP's over Ukraine, Russia saying they shot down one, now we're shooting them down as well. From the government finally acknowledging UFO's are "real", to the establishment of the Space Force.  It feels like we're on the verge of a major revelation as far as other life visiting our planet.
Pilot 1: Is that a UFO? Pilot 2: Confirmed Pilot 1: Let's shoot it down Pilot 2 : Why? Pilot 1: We have orders to invent something gullible Americans will buy into to deflect attention from the the fact our government is headed by a dementia patient who rigged an election and blew up the Nordstream pipeline Pilot 2: What if someone finds out? Pilot 1: Donlt worry the media is in the government's pocket  Cue CNN report.......
Force field
Just after Japan bombed Pearl Harbour the US launched dozens of weather Balloons I believe around LA then set off their search lights and air raid sirens in or to distract the people and get them ready for war which it did and now they are sabre rattling with the Chinese and also Russia.
CNN sucks
Total BS, no verification from any of said pilots.
You yanks are crazy Silly ,be ready for real threats not kids playing
Acosta, well he'll just blame Trump for this conflict of the pilots.
Russia just shot one down last week
Their hear
Fake news here! There is no way the pilots are just going to speak to the press like this.
Wow Joe Biden is such a bad president that they had to pull out aliens to get The voters eyes off of him
They have had plenty of time to decide what they are. How about they tell all of us now instead of being all hush hush. Dumb
Makes perfect sense to me...
We won't know until or if they want us to know
I don’t believe it. Now all of a sudden they are giving up information.  If that’s the case let us see what’s in Area 54.
Well, if it was alien, it's good to know we can shoot it down. Hope they didn't piss someone off
False flag operation? Alien invasion!
United States send information out in space with these probes to communicate and then some say we have had contact with these probes but then we blast things out of the sky prematurely not even knowing if it is from outer space ????? A visitor ?
Jim, please just let the gray grow out, stop dying it bro, embrace the silver fox lifestyle
So the FBI is examining the wreckage from the craft that was shot down over Alaska?
Definitely Alians out there only problem if we agree we're does that leave religion?
So now it's Chinese spy balloons.    Why ?  are they telling us these things!!!     Is this thier way of disclosures ???   Please please wake up people !!!
Okay, first off, this alleged CIA analyst isn't shedding any real light on the subject over and above what most of us could deduce. Secondly, simple metallurgy tests will at least give us an indication of it's origin (terrestrial or otherwise).  Six times the speed of sound within our atmosphere?  No visible means of propulsion?  Pilots are trained observers, so even at the limits of that F-35, they would still be able to ascertain if it is a balloon, drone or otherwise. It's puzzling to me why they were  unable to accomplish this.
One time I heard a loud noise outside. I went to look and even my neighbor was outside it was around 3am. It looked like a ufo and it had lots of color lights. Me and my neighbor were watching it I went inside and told my girlfriend come see this cus there not gonna believe it. It was wild.
They are LYING to us y'all.
Its a bit psychopathic to shoot something down before you even know what it is.
Okay we have ufos being shot out the sky we have a earthquake that has killed over 36000 people and we have a huge chemical spill in ohio! What next world! What next?
Apparently if it was from other worlds the government won't tell us because we can't handle it and we'd all panic and the world would go into meltdown because we are so terrified.  WHATEVER!
The CCP are liars and fools. The CCP is the true evil of the world.
Cool, can you tell us the actual truth now though?
WEATHER  BALLOON !!
The pilots know more but are not allowed to say anything
History channel has excellent interview with fighter pilots and they insisted that this was unclassified.
Whether it's China or another country, they are  testing how fast America's homeland security can detect such spyballoons. Since America reacted late & slow, then there's a chance an enemy can inflict a successful disastrous/deadly attack on American soil. American should be more alert & watchful.
Bullshit. They know what it is...
All those planes and no pictures Yeah right I hope it isn't ET as we do not look friendly Here comes Mother!!!!
All Of a sudden speaking about aliens is normal and being televised alot 👀 what’s the truth being hidden ?  Putting focus on aliens 😂 disgusting
Maybe it was a time traveler ?  ⌛🛸
Nice
Robert Baer making more excuses.  there is no debris
Lie.  they have not found object off Alaska.  they were to stupid to mark these objects on their GPS
Were these 3 "flying objects" (Alaska, Canada & Lake Huron) Balloons or Not ? That's the main starting question.
I, for one, would like to welcome our alien visitors to planet Earth 😃 Recommend that they sample our films and literature. Happy to be a tour guide on Saturdays.
They hit it with a sidewinder at 40k feet.  I doubt it’s intact lol
Where are the videos from the fighter jets?    Biden should release the audio and the video from the close encounter with the object.
It's just electro magnetic anti gravity technology. Victor Grebennikov.
E.T. got shot down he was just going to see Elliott
Distractions....
So where was the balloon launched from? And it wasn't detected earlier? We are not foolish
I could within a few days make my own balloon/drone and control it from my living room using wifi any where in the world using only Amazon parts.  I can’t imagine what foreign military’s are capable of. It’s the Chinese, not aliens lol
This is an inside job
Seems like they’re just trying to spin it to make it sound like UFO’s (no visible propulsion; jamming plane controls etc) to distract the world while they study whatever those object really are (probably Chinese again)
Wow, the "lying government hiding stuff" types are out in force again. How about this one: it's a dirt cheap way for Russia to test air defences. A whole bunch of them were spotted over Kiew as well, for example. It could even be the rocket man in North Korea. It's apparently quite easy to float them over to the US - the Japanese did it in WWII. Nothing new.
Look here at  balloons, we want ypu to believe aliens, and not at pipeline your goverment blew up!!
Making up stuff and keeping everyone in the dark and occupied while that crook loser you have as president is covering up stuff that matters.
The military doesn't deserve their forgiveness. That being said the military does NOT speak for me, I don't know about you.
Mach 6 ?? WTF ? What goes mach 6?
2023: Aliens 😂
the lack of transparency here is just fueling more conspiracy theory, which is exactly what we DON'T need
LOS ASESINOS NOS ECHAN DE YOUTUBE PARA MATARNOS FACILMENTE AMORDAZADOS.
14 year old, little Jenny just lost her high school science fair project, a  weather balloon,  to a missile.  Bummer.
I'm pretty certain any alien UFOs would be able to out manoverve and out pace any fighter jet that it came up against. 👽👽
its a weather balloon !! I did remote viewing before they shot it down, you have my word !!👽
...shot down an alien school bus on the way to Antarctica and that's how the invasion/war starts...
Repent of your sins and trust that Jesus died for you!
So an object takes it time going all the way across the US. What does this tell you about our military readiness? secret or not, the military doesn't seem to be ready to take immediate action. How big is their budget? Will they again make the same lame excuse: "We need more money"? If you aren't doing your job properly with what you asked for, why should we give you more? so you can continue to do a substandard job with the given resources?
My only concern would be for the truth. Can we trust that those who operate in our government will tell us the truth? I can understand keeping a secret under some circumstances, but people in government are not known for their honesty. Most of the information we get is intended to extract money from our pockets. Government officials assist businesses in doing that by doing nothing to stop it or making idiotic laws that don't make sense. Can we trust news media when they are given money to support narratives? Nah!
amazing they are only above america and not the rest of the world.... I guess other countries don't need the distractions......
Trumpust could be behind it.  He is buddies, buddies with Russia and China.
You guys can call the first one a Chinese balloon, but the other ones you cannot. They’ve already announced that they are not made of the same material and they are not like the first one and went on to say that they were not balloons.
more balloons
🤣🤣  Ok, our military has shot down AND recovered something they are implying is "out of this world" and can't identify and don't know shit about and they start running their suck holes to the press (is that) what we're suppose to believe?  A week or two of this deflection and everyone will forget hunters laptop, joes classified docs and "the big guys" compromised by china
Maybe I'm missing something, but are we supposed to believe our billion-dollar aircraft have no on board cameras and no way to slow down and photograph these objects?  I call bull shit!
BS - cnn is doing "misinformation" to deflect from the problems of "the big guys" scandals
They can get different planet pics but not a single pic of UFO American government is just trying to distract public from real issues
China will soon use nano balloons  we will need James Webb telescope to see them coming🤑
Free #Julianassange
If I ask Einstein he will say they should have shot the balloon with arrows  than using missile.... the blew it into pieces and says its a mystery they can't find all the fragments🤑🤑🤑🤑
Oh god the Martians are taking advantage of the chinese balloon... they are hear on earth👽👽👽👽👽🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Why are China doing this? Because US spy ballons were found over China! So the question is why is the US doing this and then accusing the victim of being aggressive when they retaliate, like you always do. F'ing USians! You're going to start a war and drag other nations into it. Give it a rest please!
Silk and some plastic and we used a rocket?😂
Fake NEWS
Ok so I am a ufologist. In the early 2000s we added FLIR (forward looking undated) and we have been able to see and detect these TRUE ufo/UAP now. Not balloons. Now we have also updated our other sensor intelligence gathering devices like radar, sonar, satellites and can now see these strange objects that are not made made. Not the Chinese or Russian drones. In 2008 I have personally seen something that we at first thought was a stealth bomber but it hovered and was silent for about a minute and a half. We were on a cliff and it lowered from the night sky at 2am and was brighter than any star. Until it got level with us we could finally see the outline then thinking it was a stealth bomber. Until we noticed no noise, how slow it was going being only 40-50 feet away from the cliff. Then finally it went from 10 mph too warp/light speed disappearing over the Delaware river. This was in Bucks county PA. There was a UFO flap for about 6 months everyone was seeing them. And we saw several other events that made me change my thinking about everything and start researching all these events
NORAD: "Nope, we didn't find a single thing out there!" *slides alien wreckage under rug*
I "heard" about e.m.p. generators being launched. The propulsion would be the air currents.
For every classified document that is found another UFO grows wings. 👽 🐂 💩
Nobody believes CNN. Still fake news.
Weather balloons. Different weather balloons. Next thing you know we will be "locking down" and staying within our 15 min cities because of aliens. Just another means of control. Aliens are the new virus.
It’s not a UFO it was King Kong’s Condom.
The military aircraft are observing an object that is essentially floating at an unknown rate and at high altitude. The military aircraft are probably subsonic or less than,  if we use ground level to measure Mach, 760 mph. Pretty hard to tell what the hell something actually is, especially if the orders are to shoot it down.  Let's not put the onus on the pilots especially by a couple clueless newsies. Mr. Baer is spot on. This is real stuff not a movie.
It's the US government people really!!!!, Project blue nipples; For real folks..😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧
IRON MAN <3  is here
That’s alien technology is so advance that it will wait for you up there and let you to shot it down. So dump CNN! 😂
1:40 she says they found debris, now they are saying they found no debris....
History teacher: "and in 2023 the U.S was invaded by floating balloons"
Another one 😂 guys expect another global mass scale manipulations on our way!
if these are aliens that came here from space we have zero technology to shoot them down
I don’t believe anything that is reported by mainstream media…. Let’s see the sensor recordings from the aircraft that shot it down…. Oh right that would be called transparency smfh
It was ET and his cousins trying to say hi again to America  it came from Mars saying stat the hell away from my peaceful planet you are messing up the earth so leave Mars alone or the ET’s will attack
Biden illegitimate government B.S.
LOL. Last guy interviewed here is a conspiracy factory all by himself.
Ok so is it China fuckin with us or what?
Aliens defo would wait until Zelenszkij takes over Bicycle Master Biden in W.H. Imagine that the new official language will be ukrainian in the States.
Would not trust the FBI with anything after all the corruption in that agency!
This guy just said Mck 6 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOW OK ?  That is something like 4.600 mph . Manybe at 120 above the Earth  . Not at 40,000 ft  . Unless it was a unman scram jet . But still have to be above 90,000 ft .  Mack 3 was the speed of the X-15 went at with the power plant liquid rockets and that was at 80,000 ft . Even at that speed at that ALT it got hot as hell .  So this guy is not telling the truth or just an idiot CNN found .
NOT SPY BALLOON....GOVERNMENT IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND USING RAPTOR JET WITH MISSILES TO SHOW OFF. NO SPYING , CHINA HAS SATELLITES THAT CAN SEE A BLADE OF GRASS ....BALLOONS ARE AT 60,000 FEET ....NOT DANGER TO AIRCRAFT !        THAT'S WHY THEY USED RAPTOR PLANE TO GO THAT HIGH....ALL THAT  SMOKE FULL OF POISON AND DISEASE AND HEAVY METAL
How do you think the spread of Covid came from. 😂
Interfered with their instruments?? Sounds extraterrestrial to me.
Operation Lollipop .
The US Navy is now trying to find a guy to go off the ship to retrieve the UFO . It is vary hard to pick a sailor not wearing a dress .
Why all know your doing things because they are realise the epstein list  Shut up cnn.
I am Chinese . I been on one of these rides to get here in the US of A  . Let me tell you it was not fun . I cant tell you how many Russians try to shoot me down .
As of today i been seeing an orange light zigzagging on the night aboved the new jersey night skies. I work 3pm to 1130pm on robbinsville warehouse and on my break at 7pm i went out for a cigarette and i look up as i usually do to look for satellites planes ect.. but this object right by the constellation of orion right hand side i see it doing moves not satellite or plane can do. I been seeing it since this past monday february 13 2024. If you guys gals are on the northern hemisphere, look at the orion constellation and you'll see it too. It look like a star but look at the stars and look at the object. It moves very erie. Anyone with homeland security access should seriously look into it. I recommend everyone to look ant the upper right hand side of the orion constellation.
CNN bull -------  . CNN is just guessing and grabbing at straws . The US military is not going to tell anyone not even the news or us . I am not saying fake news . I am just saying that these news programs like this just dont know . I would even bet the pilots would not tell them unless they was ordered to . They cant . Is called National Security .
Another Chinese spy balloon "Freudian slip. Its us basically shooting us and blaming it on China. Remember this. Like the aliens would travel lightyears away to be fallen from some restarted idiots from earth lool
This is BS!!! No one spoke on these lies. Get the pilot on the show or news if so. No facts whatsoever.
How to be saved and be right with God for eternal life! 1-Admit you’re a sinner and be willing to turn from your own self righteousness to God. 2-Believe  onto  Jesus Christ,who being the begotten Son of God, died on the cross, was buried and resurrected for the full forgiveness of our sins as a free gift. 3-Confess onto God,asking to be saved accepting this free gift of salvation, to start a new life being born again after being saved from your sins.  Scripture links below from the King James Bible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The romans road to salvation. 1.Romans 3:10, “As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:" 2.Romans 3:23, “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” 3.Romans 5:8, “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." 4.Romans 5:12, “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:" 5.Romans 6:23, “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” 6.Romans 10:9, “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” 7.Romans 10:13, “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”  An example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.  “Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving. I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me. I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ. I believe that Jesus is God, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. I trust in him alone to save me. Nothing else. Not my good works or anything else. Only Jesus. I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”  More scripture. John 3:15-17 15."That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life." 16."For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." 17."For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”  Romans 5:8-9 8."But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9."Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."  1 Corinthians 15:1-4, 1."Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2."By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.” 3."For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;” 4."And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”  Hebrews 9:27-28 27."And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:" 28."So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”  Ephesians 2:8-9 8."For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:" 9."Not of works, lest any man should boast.”  Revelation 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”  More Scripture for how people will act before/in the last days.  1 Timothy 4:1-5 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;" 2."Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;”  3."Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth..” 4."For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving” 5."For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.”   2 Timothy 3:1-7 1."This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come." 2."For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy," 3."Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good," 4."Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;" 5."Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away." 6."For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts," 7."Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.”
Thousands of people in Ohio are displaced and suffering in OH from the chemical spill and subsequent mishandling.... I give zero f**ks about things we can shoot down.
natasha kinda bad ngl
Humanity getting a new downloadable content 😎
Why do they keep saying “frozen water?”  It’s ice 🧊!  I C E!
It's all bullshit!! Probably some weather balloons! They're trying to stray attention from their sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines in Germany. Also they will try to blame Russia or China... all of a sudden, the Chinese who have never started a war since WWII are spying and provoking the States? Or Russia, as if they don't have their hands full with Ukraine!!! This will definetely increase the defense budget and put taxpayers money in the military establishblent!!
When news is this vague, it is probably extraterrestrial.  The  CIA are fighting amonst themselves trying to figure out what to tell us. I think the Men in Black control the CIA.  The CIA has ben covering up information since President  Kennedy was in office at least.
Ask yourselves why they are telling us anything at all
The question is...HOW(Means and Methods) an abject is circulating and moving in space!?
👽👽
Very simple. They could be releasing a virus or multiple  organisms.
Where's the gun cam footage?
Why do we vote these people in office? We need to start putting other people in office who’s for the people by the people with the people because this government is brokering
This was crazy. The whole world is watching and y’all still yall going to lie.
@5:11 Mach 6!
Distract the masses and hide the defence budget under the rug
@.............. WIN justice peace and Love The. 👽👽👆📢We are the  magnets force , balloones show you how to build your future our balloones jump speed 10km / s high 8000 km/s lern 👽💯💓🌏
We are not alone, we have never been alone...
Liar incompetent Joe Biden said shooting balloons down over Alaska was dangerous to the population. What changed in 2 weeks?
It must be the Aliens, not just any Aliens, this is Communist Aliens!!
This is a smokescreen for more important things goingon in the world.
You will never get the truth from the government or the msm , you are told what they want you to think
This is to whip up the US population for an upcoming war with China-watch Raytheon stock! This war will cause great destruction-which is good for the "Merchants of death"
I love Natasha, She's shiny.
Maybe they just want to take precautions before whatever meeting their having to make sure everything is what they say it is
This is World War III: US versus aliens camouflaged as Chinese balloons
Oh Geesh I wish I could trust CNN news.
So, this is that time of History...
Well let's put it this way , what ever it is or what ever they are . Those in the security services and the likes of NORAD aren't going to give us the real story .
It's fabricated news just to gain more public support for unlimited funds for the American military industrial complex. This fake alien invasion story has been ready to go for a long time.
It was so now the US is so scared of China that they're shooting down ET. I hate to break it to you but ET is our ally not our enemy.
Sounds intelligent.. let's shoot at something we know absolutely Nothing about..it's not like it could have biological  ot radioactive weaponry on board for such an occasion as this.. 🙄
There's also Chinese people in the USA so they are probably feeding info back to China who knows really 🤔🤔🤔🤔👍👍😎
Diversion!
The Chineese just wanted to get a first hand look a Bigfoot . They are thinking of creating their own  Gookman  in China .
Just wait 30 years so they unclassified tgis shit XD
🇷🇺 Z yous  toy car 200,000 with michen guns at Finland war
How much does this cost the tax payers, sending up fighter jets.  This is stupid!!!! Sure, let us  here what the pilots said.  Liar, liar, CNN is on fire!!!!!!
Mmmh, and they just could not do that with the planes that went off course on 9/11, right?

Stop this stupid story spreading!!!! How about this is a lie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is a lie!!!! Taking attention off of the pipe line USA blow up.  Yeah, the Chinese sent ballons  from the other side of the world!!! Sure!  Spend money on the inner city kids--give them summer camps, give them training programs to learn a skill.  How can CNN keep from laughing!!!!!
Reminds me of the song “99 red balloons”… In the lyrics, a boy and girl innocently release a batch of balloons into the air; confused by these flying objects, international governments panic, triggering a nuclear holocaust.
CNN - Communist News Network…….. pathetic
Aliens ! Aliens ! Come on, space boys, put us out of our misery.
What the actual fk is going on?? It feels like we only know because many ppl saw and posted it on social media and now media and gov they keep changing the story hourly!!
Im an alien from a far away galaxy... and my cousin was on an inter-stellar Alaskan cruise... minding his own business and well... scramble the jets
If you equip our military fighter jets and missiles with AI advanced trajectory systems you can cut off the maneuverable of a UFO. Unless it’s moving at light speed then there’s no reason why we can’t shoot it down. Let AI do the work!!
Has china hit on new tech?  And of course the pilots will all see different things that happens all the time.they r edofgenert Popeye at different viewpoints and that was  all quite fast
cnn the land of the bullshit and propaganda
L
Anything that are detected near or in Alaska airspace are probably very likely belonging to the Russian militaries to probing U.S. response for advantages and it weaknesses.
They are telling lies that they shoot it down those things are more advance than human.
What a full of crab story.  So basically the public is banned from the truth, like always.  Aliens? 😂  Governments messing up with their technologies.  The best part though are those pilots who have no clue what they saw. Hopefully these are not the same ones sent to wars, otherwise they might shot their fellas.
CNN - DO YOU THINK THAT ANYONE WILL BELIEVE WHAT YOU AND BILL ACOSTA HAVE TO SAY???? YOU BOTH ARE A JOKE AND A LAUGHING JOKE..
So are we to believe those jets don't have cameras? Where's the pictures? Also, a political statement. FUCK BRANDON.
They should have detected any microbians spread through firing at it...they are now exposed
This is just an introduction to UFOs this is just having everybody tune in to see what those objects are we are the UFO we already know what they're going to do they want everybody paying attention if they wanted to attack us they would have done it Millennial ago
Oh how much sense does that make that the Chinese military is going out on their own they'd be executed
Can,t Trust the FBI or the gov.
🤡  Какви кловнови !!! 🤣🤣🤣
It's time we call BS to protecting systems and methods as a reason to lie to the American people. We aren't 10 years old.
Other pilots said this, other pilots said that. How many pilots where there? Lmao
So typical LYING BS COVERUP ABOUT THE UFOS OVER ALASKA AND CANADA!! WHERE ARE THE HIGH RESOLUTION PICTURES FROM THE JETS THEY SENT UP?? WE'RE ALLOWED TO SEE BALLOONS WHICH JUST FLOAT ALONG IN THE WIND BUT THEY SENT INTERCEPTOR JETS UP AND THEY HAD TO MANEUVER TO ENGAGE!! THE CANADIAN PILOTS SAID THEIR SENSORS WERE INTERFERED WITH OR DISRUPTED!! THAT IS WHY THEY COULD NOT HAVE SHOT THE CYLINDRICAL METALLIC OBJECT WITH NO WINGS OR VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION CRUISING AT HIGH ALTITUDE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET A TARGET LOCK!! SO, THE OFFICIALS SAID THEY WOULD LET THE OBJECT(S) CRUISE ALONG ALL NIGHT BUT THEY WOULD KEEP TRACKING ON RADAR AND THEN INTERCEPT THE NEXT DAY!! LIKE THEY COULD DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT!! THEY HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO LET IT GO!! WHEN THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE STARTS STUMBLING/BUMBLING OVER HIS WORDS TO SAY THAT THEY BROUGHT IT DOWN OVER "FROZEN WATER"(CAN'T SAY ICE?) AND THE WRECKAGE WAS IN A VERY REMOTE AREA, YOU KNOW YOU'RE HEARING A COVERUP!! I DOUBT THEY COULD HAVE SHOT IT DOWN!! PROBABLY LANDED ON THE ICE!! IF THERE IS DEBRIS THEN SHOW US THE LIVE SHOTS!! BUT THEY HAVE THE GALL TO HAVE NORAD SAY IT WAS A GLITCH IN THE RADAR AND THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING THERE!! BS!!! IF OUR ULTRA HI-DEF SUPER RADARS/SENSORS HAVE TRACKED SOMETHING, THEN THAT'S WHY THE JETS WERE SCRAMBLED TO BEGIN WITH!! ESPECIALLY IF CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT PILOTS ARE REPORTING CLOSE ENCOUNTERS AT THE TIME AND GROUND BASED OBSERVERS ARE ALSO TRACKING THEM USING HIGH QUALITY OPTICALS!! JEOPARDY LAST NIGHT HAD A QUESTION REFERENCING  PAINTER GIOTTO AND HIS DEPICTION OF A DISC TYPE UFO SENDING A SCANNING BEAM DOWN TO A RENAISSANCE VIRGIN MARY!! The answer to the question contended that GIOTTO HAD DEPICTED AN APPEARANCE OF HALLEY'S COMET!! WHAT A CROCK!! HALLEY'S COMET DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A DISC TYPE UFO SHOOTING A BEAM DOWN TO A HUMAN BEING!! ANYTHING TO CONTINUE WITH THE COVER UP!! TIME TO QUIT DITHERING AROUND AND SIDE-STEPPING THE TRUTH AND SHOW US WHAT'S UP!! WE CAN HANDLE IT!!
what ever is said on cnn you can count on it being 99.999 % LIES
Didn’t they claim a weather balloon 🎈 in Roswell, and what year was that lol
I live  in  the  UK.   I've been whatching  programs for a number of years .   There is a  program in the UK, ..ancient aliens...it goes into depth from start to finish, to instances like this video!!  It's a UFO or if some Reversing Engineering  has happened  it's just so we as a species  can get our head round it rather than what governments  would say cause Anarchy.  I don't believe  this as human beings have been aware for centuries & in the last 100 or so years as we've evolved technology wise pretty quick!!  The whole human system  across the board is a disgrace because  the people  at the top want to keep us working like a dog such as paying  Rip off prices for housing Rip off prices for vehicles  Rip of Tax & all other utilities   So the people at the top & can get the cream as an individual  & his family like king, queen's etc  But let's go with UFO, I wonder how many more years it will take for the US & UK to say out right, that there is & has been Exterestrials coming & going & living among us & as  As for the great BIG WHOLE in the ANTARCTIC, well we should know about all issues by now!!!!!!!!!  The reason why human beings are  so called violent  race so were told, will be because  others at the top who run the economy advise the architecture  of an economic  system but as its never upto date so as a result people,  suffer, ie  Lose job Savings sucked out of all peoples pocket  due to Credit crunch. Pandemic companies going into liquidation, repossession,  foreclosures,...  Leading to stress, alcohol,  domestic  abuse, violence, divorce etc etc because  everyone is broke in the pocket & stressed because  the system    Sends out threatening  letters to get blood out of a stone, because  can't pay mortgage  or something  or developers building  homes & ripping people off once again so one CEO can get Rich & qualified workers get more than average Joe but even then its shared amongst all contractors individually  for example  first come first serve...  I could go on..no point voting unless it's every say 100 years or 50 as people who have come b4 or academics  say as much  But as we know the government  only chooses to listen to academics,  or scientists when they can spin a manipulation for the people to digest like PIGS!!!
I won't vote if there's no Transparency on this matter imagine  what else they are keeping from us.
Where are the videos and how can they say they are not aliens if they don't know what they are let's make this make sense
Balloon thing bought  time in order for Blinken not to go/be received in China. Do not forget around 24 february china s president is going to russia
Why this government  of USA all of them and their pilots must to take some kind of pill, I think you are all schizophrenic. stop taking the other kind of drugs. don't forget the medication. Love from Europe 😂😂😂
i know we have come a long way since our first days of human flight, but i'm shocked these people don't know how a balloon works. No it does not need engines to stay up, nor propulsion to move around  also:  interfering with sensors is nothing new, and can literally be as simple as a piece of aluminum. again, i know the US is not to fighting an enemy who jams/interferes with their sensors... but come on, i would have figured you would at least know about them.  Also, a great reason why our jets should not need te rely on sensors as much as the F35 does. Like seriously, the thing has a button which will have the plane take off on it's own... why? just why? is it in case the pilot is unconscious or something? because i have serious questions about your logic if it is.
Imagine, you have the technology to travel to other galaxy and then are shot down by a bunch of Apes that can't stop fighting with each other. What a joke. LMFAO
Saddly now going on another planet with aliens seems a good idea than dealing with wars, earthquakes, strange virus, many bad people and wearher going crazy
5:17 “it was just….. figure it out” What did he say there?
USA is a laughing stock to the rest of the world 😂
Oh no, we have to depend on the FBI to tell us what it is.
If the Chinese and the Russians can't figure out how to make planes that we already have how are they going to make something that doesn't have a propulsion system? Maybe the guy you're talking to is an idiot or does not want to release information
People still talking Covid why are they still alive  Bring back the influenza please Covid is outdated
Theirs absolutely no way a f35 shot down a actual ufo
Load off shit makes news  USA is in deep s—t is this really how to get people to believe in  If this is a ufo not f35 even F3500 won’t get near
They could be making it up see how ppl react
IT WAS A FLYING DILDO
Nobody knows nothing, it's a UFO don't mess with the UFO.
So they shot down some Chuck-E-Cheese balloons who cares how about the fact that Joe Biden committed an act of war without Congressional approval against a NATO country Germany by destroying the Nord stream pipeline when are you going to do a story on that you know reality
dear Sleepy & gang, in case you hadn’t noticed, over one hundred million ponds of vinyl chloride was on that train & the EPA have now confirmed that it has entered the Ohio River Basin - home to 25 million people .... were you planning on mentioning it at all ? or are we just cracking on with the relentless ufo clown show stuff ???
Yeah the lying fbi just what Meticans need.  We are si k of being kept from the truth
Is it just me, or do other people think it's time that the world's governments stop deciding (for our own good) whether we can be told about the presence of aliens around our planet? If they exist, we the people, have an absolute right to know!
People of the world we must begin to put more effort into maintaining ease of mind and peace. We must begin to work together. We must teach our children. We have great potential as a planet but we must find a new way.
Sounds like you should be reporting on a different story
Cylindrical shape and size of a car. That is no plane or alien craft. It sounds to me like a big drone .
We suck as a species! Don't feed,clothe, house and make sure everyone gets the medical care needed. Sometimes I wonder  what God was thinking.
We blew up Nord stream ... Oh hey look everyone balloons lol
Who can believe  the so called news  anymore
WTF! WHO'S WATCHING?
baloons are kind of weapon engaging military forces. They are cheap, and could be released in billions. Who sent them, is testing the reaction and has data to predict such a weapon ability to fight against US. Some of them could be weaponized, for example with incendiary bombs, to make them danger and to push Air Force to react. This is new kind of weapon, similar to drones, but able to sustain on high altitude for months. Question; how we could destroy billion of such a balloons? Answer; in no way we could do it. All Air Force would be engaged, and still many of them would fly over US.
If anyone cares to know, I once saw a UFO years ago when I was in highschool at break time, this Orange super bright light small thing in the sky without moving, almost like a tennis ball seen from that distance, and all of a sudden instantly moved up and turned right at full speed until it disappeared.
They were alien 👽 😳
I wanted to say pilots in earlier message.
They are going to require higher taxes from people to upgrade their defense military to fight against this so called "mystery".
We will never get the truth!
Poppets telling truth. It will be claimed that it can’t be found where it fell !
It was likely a  delivery fuselage that would display the same drag and ballistic behavior as a loaded one so they  could see the flight path and then be able to predict another flight path or trajectory using the same fuselage with a  payload . Where are the images from the responding jets .  ?
Sarah Palin's brain? (Full of hot air and you can't figure how it stays up.)
We are ufo duh
A missile missed.dont worry ..this will not escalate these people have been here for life as we know it
Are those f35s and fighter jets not able to slow down?. Serious question. Bc they keep talking about how the planes are so fast that they couldn't see it good or whatever. I'm thinking, why not slow down.
Get Bob Lazar to check it
no propulsion system means anti gravity technology which humans don't have yet
I guess our fighter pilots are idiots? Is that what you are saying?
Tell me Biden isn’t an Alien and I will call you a liar
I'm ready to pledge my allegiance to General Zod
Another properganda story it's all crap they love feeding the public
People thinking aliens 👽 are real is a joke.
It was super Grover..
The Hollow earth people are coming 😳
CNN you are doing such a good work i pretending you are a real news outlet. I'm proud of you.
Frequency hopping,  population... the guy has no idea what he is talking about!
If it was Chinese to fly a cylinder at Mach 6 then why circle back to a balloon drifting the jetstreams
🛸
So I have an idea. It was a smaller much more sophisticated spy craft, the balloons were literally a distraction to see how far the more sophisticated craft could advance. We’ve seen the balloons already, so why would they not tell us if it was a balloon. I’m starting to think that all countries have vastly superior technology than what we are all aware of.
Interesting it was really close to the prudoh bay oil field
No Footage - No object. Just an excitement
These viewing figures are a complete fabrication!!
Psyop
BLA,BLA. People are not stupid.
Balloons stay in the air by containing helium or hydrogen...and they keep talking about propulsion but never mentioned what speed it was going, what direction etc
HORRIBLE rapporting by the cnn. Stop with teasing the cynical conspiracy-nut in people. UNIDENTIFIED means what is said. IDIOTS and DREAMERS will talk like they have identified it in their own genious little minds and think "ALIENS!!!". What is more likely ? That it is some sort of drone, or that an alien species traveled hundrets of lightyears through space to be shot down over a little country on a small grain of sand? Please stop with the arrogance. Just wait for answers.
Just an nother smoke screen by your government .
Ok where is the video and photos of this  flying vehicle (UFO)? We saw the balloons, right? Now show us the UFO!!!
This clown still has a job?
If it was truly alien then those fighter jets would have been annihilated
It's a to generate fear like Covid. Don't buy in to this
…and just like that, nobodies talking about classified documents
Maybe some hardline warmongers in china. Did it
Bullshit narrative is all this commie administration has
No one cares, psyop failed. What's going on in Ohio?

US education. Well known in the world as not so good, only in America they believe its best of the best. Those are weather balloons, payload is camera and solarpanels, connected to satellites. They move around with jet streams, very same Japan uses in WW2 to send bombs to US soil. To make them last longer sender can try different shapes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_balloon
UFO
Just wait for it - Military defence needs more money.
More worried about our own government than UFO's that's for sure
That's all the F16 is capable of these days, shooting down a balloon...kids would use a bow and arrow. .....They are pretty good at blowing up German gas pipelines though, when no one is looking. This balloon bullshit is a smokescreen covering the biggest ecologic terrorist attack in the history of the world. Where the US government destroyed the energy supply of another NATO country WTF. But this is what you numbsculls get from the crooked MSM....and you take it all in like a toilet.
Just say "we have no frigging idea but we are going to pump some steroids into this shit story and milk it for what it's worth"
I love when something happens it’s either Russia or china. Damn u guys 😀
So just wanna put this out there; what if the object they shoot next doesn’t go down so easily? Just saying that we don’t know what were doing and not being cautious about it can turned around and doom us all! We will never know…
Please...make peace on earth...i am princess riovi david...from philippines...
Chinese spy balloons using stealth or camouflage combined with fighters moving at 400 knots.  Of course it is not going to be identified!  Chinese take advantage of US radar algorithms limitations of picking up objects moving at less then 30 knots such as  a balloon.
More Chicken Noodle News blather.
It was a balloon millions of dollars to shoot balloons down what were you guys thinking
Why did they go back to UFO instead of UAP’s?!? Random af
Recon satellites, from fellow human or non-human?
So it wasnt a balloon?  Are they saying it was airborne without any identifiable propulsion or flotation devices? So how the hell was it staying in the air?! This report is so stupid.
CNN working on American  psyops to get us to ww3
Aliens have the technology to travel across the Universe.....  all to get shot down by an F-16 designed in the 70's. Makes sense if the "System" is trying to distract you from SOMETHING.
The Americans shouldn't jump to conclusions but keep an open mind, remember a country as advanced as yours any body would be curious to know what your about including aliens...if they do exist
CNN finally report something worth watching. Thank you
What is the possibility that these objects are coming from North Korea also if they are carrying something, different,  kinds of cargo that can cause harm in the atmosphere.  These bombing of our earth needs to stop. Our earth is in trouble and this planet belongs to us all and we all want to live, love and have families.  We need to live in peace. 2/2023
Imagine what would happen if everytime humans went to another planet their spaceship was shot down we wouldn't have any information about other planets now  would we?
Letsget to the nitty gritty and put Botulinum toxin in Russia & China's resovoirs ,that will perhaps stop them f in with us.
Russell Brand is right ....
It’s becoming increasingly clear that China and the aliens are working together. That is bad news bears, folks.
I'm pretty sure they were trying to find a way into their system
ALIENS👽
Gd Natasha fine af
These are not Alien space craft as there is no such thing as aliens. It'll be something from China or Russia most likely.
I don’t understand how we can’t capture these flying objects!!??? Why shoot them down? Don’t we have the capability to trap and seize?
Hey CNN, what about the Nordstream pipeline.  The balloons are a great big nothing burger.  They are a distraction designed to make us forget that the United States blew up a pipeline that belonged to Russia.  We actually blew a pipeline that was designed to help our NATO allies.  Typical CNN, helping the government spread false propaganda in order to distract the public from the real news.  No wonder your ratings a soooooooo low.
Hunter Biden is China's spy balloon. Twitter Files proves it.
Calm down folks it’s another distraction
If it's shot down, why is it still mysterious?
Demonic fallen angels from the spiritual world manifesting into the physical world. God warned of things like this in His Word.
Gigi
I believe 🌞🛸🌌🙏🏾
Idk I could be wrong
Maybe they watching this time line school students studying man, maybe they know wats about too happen,
Idk I could be wrong
This war is about the economic shift in power the new world currency set too be released the BRICS, Wich will be the new world trading note,
Germany made the mistake of attacking america n Russia together, NATO n america is making the mistake of attacking Russia n china , Iran, n north korea
Everything else is a smoke screen
NATO vs BRICS WORLD WAR III, IS WHATS THIS IS ALL ABOUT,
“Hear what pilots said…”   But you don’t “hear” what they said. 🤬
We sure showed those balloons who's boss!
"The object was shot down over frozen water . . . " yeah . . . we call that stuff "ice".
If they were alien crafts, I think it's a prelude, too the Ohio trail sabatoge, the new sittings in china, n Moldova n Ukraine, it's like indepence day, I think america is planning some real big here, COVID climate change, the emergence of BRICs economy n currency soon, all those with power are afraid too lose it, idk it's a wild guess
Right so ufos have been visiting earth for thousands of years and now usa thinks the best course of action is to attack and imply they are a threat.... Does anybody else think its time we wipe out the pentagon and all elites of the world who are legitimately retarded?? I have no hope for humanity if people believe any of this rubbish. If the first response is to attack any visitors that come to earth.... We will not survive at all in space.
I suspect the ufo is so advanced that they can’t make it public
It is not "Shee" it is "Xi" - you guys can't pronounce shiite
It’s another spy craft!
At some point they will piss off whoever owns these things. I seriously doubt technology from some other galaxy can be shot down by a slow fossil burning jet.
Chinese balloons?!!! Plural?!! Phuck you...and you're redirecting rhetoric.  Lies. Galactic federation is calling in that debt
What do you wanna bet they didn’t get any video of these “UFOs” 😂
Interfering with air craft instruments? Sounds real ufo
We've been in a simulation since 2019 don't @ me you know it's true
Made up distraction 🤣
UFO 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Even if it's aliens or whatever if they have the technology to get to earth they have to technology to kill us off easily
It came from outer space
We will never be told the truth ... it's disgusting really...Just gotta go with your gut about it & mine tells me it's a distraction...
I know the propulsion system used. And it's hot air from China!
It's all a distraction
Please PLEASE PLEASE stop looking at Bidens corruption
#FAKENEWS #CLICKBAIT #CLICKBAITFAKENEWSCNN #F××KCNN
Can we get space x or some real scientists to take a look. I don’t trust the FBI for this type of analysis.
CNN=CartooN Network
"Hear" what? So far, all I've heard is what officials are saying was said by the pilots. I want to hear the recordings.
wow i  get it its finally a way to tell if true aliens are real the leaders are trying to break the lies they said wasnt true gotta love the smart phone cameras taking pics we all already know the ones answering  its lies they know
How do we know these UFOs are from China? Here we are, ready to go to war, what if another country’s trying to make us think these ballon’s are from China. Then we get tricked into starting a war with China, and it’s not their fault. We  better be careful, and get all our facts straight.
pathetic. Stop making up BS to distract from Ukraine...
There trying to see if they can just float in a nuke to us
It's 👽
I came to enjoy the comments from the usual pseudo-intellectuals. The self proclaimed "critical thinkers" who are basically just a bunch of contrarians, or the usual tinfoil conspiracy lunatics who cry about WEF, Bill Gates, 5G, vaccines, etc.
Theory: Chinese put ballon at 60k feet because new objects we found were appearing in their spy satellites. They suspected it was US technology but it obviously wasn’t.
If God is sending His crafts to His earth, and you shoot Him down, who is going to save you from the destruction of the earth that man is planning to do? There is no servalence on board, it's just an object sent to see if He is welcome to His own planet or is going to be treated as if He is an enemy. So why are you making yourself an enemy when you don't even know the intent or purpose of the object. You you you are endangering my life and everyone else on earth if you are shooting down beings coming here to help us survive.
What a surprise the FBI will be working on this we won't know exactly what the f*** it is or what happened
Why the heck is the FBI involved?
Bullshit  they can't say what they seen.  GET REAL.
CCP deployed $40k balloons USA used $400k missiles to shot it down!😂😂😂
🤣 This guy got owned by Trump. 🤡 NEWS
It's a distraction from Russia win the war
State media … don’t look over here … oh look up it’s a UFO!!! Nordstream pipeline / hunters laptop / Ohio Chernobyl/ the list keeps growing
Why aren't the media blocking the faces of the military & FBI agents?
I'm a Alien and I'd like to probe Natasha and leave Acosta floating out in deep space somewhere.
I'm x military and I get the feeling that some one will blow the whistle on this and leek the truth . We all know these last 3 are from another world . stop bulkshitting us all Jo !
Well that answered nothing. Lol.
poor aliens rip
Their testing the response of the military and how it's handled for bigger moves just watch..
Send in the camo dudes!
Don’t shoot your guns at the alien space craft, you could inadvertently start an interstellar war!!!
Oh I think we know what it is 👽
Liers
oh f c UK!  they changed the topic from UFO's to chinese ballons... WTF are you guys NOT TELLING US??
They make a move like this because they were losing face over the balloon. So now they pretend to be active and shoot many "geometry object" to cover their own incompetant.  The only thing this admin can do is creating PR and fakenews 🤣🇮🇱🇺🇦🇺🇲
So they are shooting at shit they had no idea about? Better go back to top gun kids
👁☀️👑
they are hiding something an it has to do with biden there trying to throw us off of what really is going on people look into it
Distractions from Biden .after they shot down the spy   Chinese balloon . Now they want to tell people it's UFOs .how ridiculous . Just plain stupid the USA government is becoming more stupid by the day
So what if the next one is nuke and we shot it down
The coverup begins. If it was something from another world we will never hear about it.
Tornado inside the ballon
It’s a new DJI balloon drone from China.
Lol horrible news reporting
Sounds like fake news
The balloons 🎈 has cloaking technology with no visible propulsion system.   The "Used car salesman " spokesman is getting very active. Send F16 to EU, shoot all the AIM-sidewinder, empty the stockpile of M113, M60, Bradley, Abrams.  China Foreign Ministry was surprised at the balloon 🎈 caper. The know it all China foreign ministry spokesman was surprised and had to check on who send those balloons 🎈.   Could it be some Intelligence units is funding a private company to send 10,000 balloons 🎈 to the US.  It a balloning into a major crisis in the US. (Buy military 🪖 industrial stocks, people).  🫣👮‍♂️🎈
Ufo that can fly in outher space get shoot down by primitive earthlings. Nonsence
Just as a example of how dumb fake new cnn are they think what they are reporting about the pilots came directly from the pilots. They are press releases Einstein....lmao
Go away CNN you lying bunch of halfwits.
The FBI Is really trustworthy
I’ve seen one 4 months ago in New Mexico it’s like a orb light that moves really quick
It's a aircraft that creates gravity in order to power it. US has these aircrafts
It. It look like like a man. Lol. BS
Is it was taken down by a combat plane there is a chance is men made. Some kind of a new aircraft with unknow technology. If It was ended extraterrestrial there is no way any plane can take it down.
BS!
Oh so there’s just Unidentified Objects in Sky’s every where Objects can Fly THEY FLY NOW pilots shot down a toaster Object for all we know????
Those pilots were probably brutally debriefed so they never said a thing about what they say.  Not unless they are a true patriot and actually care about society and believe we should know.  Then they would mysteriously be suicided.
It was.....Iron Man
"Dramatic new details ". CNN doesn't know shit.
I heard, from a reputable source, that the craft was under the control of         Caitlin Jenner
Wow so quick to respond. What happened during 9/11? #neverforget
ALL BS PROPAGATED BY THE MILITARY UNDUSTRIAL COMPLEX, TO GET THE US TAXPAYER TO PAY NORTHROP GRUMMAN,  RAYTHEON LOCKHEED AND OTHERS FOR MORE WEAPONS. WAR IS PROFIT...
What lies will we be told next
I'm annoyed with this fake journalist, I thought that he was fired.
Well Natasha has got it going on. Thank goodness we know we can trust the fbi
They didn’t get footage?
Funny are the are  willing to release the  X-Files just so no one investigates the Bidens
I miss the 80s
I would guess it came from Russia. Very concerning that it could have contained destructive weapons.  I worry that its the beginning of greater aggression against America and Canada.
Another dummy and what he thinks! Jeez! Let’s cover it all up!!! Hurry before someone sees them!
They come with vírus inside
Do cnn followers not find it odd that the way cnn isn't closely covering the catastrophic train derailment in Ohio? Or do cnn followers even know what I'm talking about?
Ya, I read that NORAD e-mail.
Dead horse. Lol
I'm surprised he didn't blame Trump for this.
So it was flying and not drifting?
But the Biden administration has told us that it’s nothing really. That it’s just a balloon. This administration is the most transparent in history! 😂😂😂
THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE!!! 🛸👽
You guys just sit there and make up stuff to scare people. BS
It's ROSWELL all Over Again!!! 🛸👽
UFOs 🛸 and Extraterrestrials 👽 Exist!!!
Killer Klowns from Outer Space or Marjorie Taylor Green
3 Navy videos showing UAPs were already leaked and CONFIRMED authentic by the Pentagon in 2017 when they admitted that they have been taking potential aliens seriously. And a 4th video from the USS Russell showing a flying pyramid was released in 2019. These unidentified objects are real. If it's shaped like a pyramid or a Gimbal and can fly without known propulsion systems, then it's not a balloon. It's extraterrestrial.
Just blow them toward Seattle until hit the Space Needle
Here comes the fake alien invasion!
This is a false flag. What's happening in Ukraine?
Typical American response SHOOT first, ask questions later.
Yes , a lot of these comments suggest to me that the government knows a lot more than what we are given in information and the press , but if you are able to peace the puzzle together, I believe that something big is around the corner and at any day we will all find out weather the government will let us know or we will be informed by social media , now this may be good or Thais may be bad , but I want you all to know no matter what happens God is real and the Lord saves remember the Holy Spirit has been sent to help those who have the faith and do believe Amen my brothers and sisters , all the best my friends and have an awesome day ;)
They caught the TIC TAC UFO!!!!!  Holy!!!
show Pictures!
There is someone or something watching us , bottom line 😊
If CNN says something know the opposite to be true
They will probably want us to believe to be attacked by aliens soon..2030 agenda in progress..😊stay smart
How much debri will be left after shot down with an A9 Missile ???
this channel is full of ......
They know exactly what it is. Thousands of satellites with cameras that can spot a fly on a golf ball! This is some kind of agenda or false flag! Fake alien invasion? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE5zFMBNQcw&t=5s
How many pilots where there?
I support the extraterrestrials that don't mean us harm
Judgement day is coming for you, Lucifer time is up, the sun of God is near, finally justice will be serve,RIP Emmett Till.
Pilots need to clean out there bong  l
They could have easily taken the balloon down by making a super sonic pass 20 feet above it.
I don’t believe anything that is about to be said. I’m not even going to give this a chance.
Project Blue Beam, Psychological Conditioning   to hide / distract from the crimes of the Fascist Elites
project blue beam really gettin everyone going
Shooting them down is racist
Probably USA after the Chinese balloon they open up and give all power to there radars and find out the 4 new objects
4 objects have been shot down surely they’ve recovered plenty & they are withholding intel from the public. Ufo or Chinese ?
Weapons of mass destruction and such!!
These thing travel at Mach 6?? That’s nuts 😮
Aliens came in peace, now were in big trouble 😂.
2 days later, what was it???
They've been lying to us about aliens since 1947.When they said it was a crashed disc with aliens one day, and a weather balloon the next.
What's going on with Ohio? Why are they not getting help?
ET is furious at China for awakening NORAD with their damned balloons. Now ET can't zip around North America any more without being harassed.
Why does it have to be Chinese or Russian? what about Nth Korea? The US are trying their hardest to talk up a conflict with China imposing sanctions for little reason and being very provocative, yet China is not responding to the US agressive tactics. What is the US up to Is it trying to start another war?
Is there Intelligent Life on US television. Does anybody know?
It sounds like professional name-dropping... assumptions of Russian or Chinese. Maybe trying to prep us for a bigger plan. Gotta get the public on board.
if this story was real, nobody would know ANYTHING about it. Not even bits of info: no size, no object, no shape...no event. If it did happen then it happened in the Arctic with no witnesses. Military would further investigate. And certainly without media. It doesn't make any sense.
So basically it's a ufo. I hope they can get to the bottom of this. Please 🙏we can figure this out 👌
The pilots where under mind control.
It's not a craft, it's a balloon. That's why it has no propulsion system. If it were aliens, we'd already be getting attacked. It'd almost obvious that this is just to distract us from the crimes of our leaders.
We don't need a $65 million dollar aircraft to bring down a balloon. A much smaller and slower aircraft with a reciprocating engine and propeller equiped with a machine gun , like a WW1 aircraft modified for these high altitudes would be sufficient to bring it down.
Definately Aliens abandoned their ship for earthlings to play olympics with in the sky , they are here , they  wanna show off how better they are , egoistic aliens.
Lies as always. How I see it US Officials aren’t telling the truth. This country just wants to go to war so badly with anyone.
Don't worry folks... The FBI are gonna investigate it. We all know you can count on the FBI. 😏
Here we go. Let the spin begin. . Anything for world war 3
When communist FBI it's going to take over that means they Will cover up everything protecting our very DENGEROUS ENEMY because the FBI HATES OUR AMERICAN CONSTITUTION AND COUNTRY AND AMERICAN CITIZENS THEY ARE OUR ENEMY
I absolutely love this it's so interesting lol what is it ?
If aliens can travel millions of light years, they don’t need to enter our atmosphere to see what’s going on over here.
It amazes me that there are no photos of these objects (unlike the balloon)and that hydrogen and helium could keep them afloat That is a no brainer. Blimps have been used for years!.
We have all kinds of pictures of the China balloon but not one picture of any of the other objects shot down. Pretty fishy to me.
The fbi will lose all the debris, just like they did the laptop.
are ALL talking heads required to make little jokes about The X Files or little green men when discussing such objects ? it's absolutely infuriating ! Are they required to laugh off the info of anything ET from their upper management who have been told from a higher power to do so ?
💯 percent something is happening and I love it I have to get another beer 🍺
FBI - X Files
SWAMP GAS....................................
This is utter bullshit
F@lse Fl@g events, because too much truth is flooding out against  the ĐÇ Đeèp Şt@țe Sw@mp Çre@tures.   FAKE NEWS
Jim smile for once in your angry life. Also why should we believe CNN or FOX anyone. They will never tell the truth. Shit will hit the fan soon. We are ripe for the pickings from whom ever is doing this.
Low ratings…boring
CNN doesn’t know how to define a woman….but they know their aliens 😂
China: those aren't our balloons  USA: yes they are  China: they are just weather balloons only for scientific research bro USA: No, they are spy balloons  China: they are UFOs USA: Oh ok, that explains it
They saw it on radar.  So, how don't they know which way it came from? Which way it was  heading? Bit of a PORKY there.
Well, it got l the attention off Hunter Biden so mission accomplished
Luke Skywalker returns home buahahahahahahahahah  Aliens want german to steal tdi diesel technology buahahahahahahahaha
Alien contact.
Yes, I believe whatever CNN tells me.
Fake alien invasion coming and im not joking
Project blue beam don't fall for it.
Wait... could it be another country has THIER OWN SECRET FORMS OF TECH?!?! Nah, it's aliens.
10 Ways to Develop The Warrior Mindset https://youtu.be/bNQ8OMl0pGs
Blue beam
First of all, there was only 1 supposed Chinese spy balloon shot down last week.  You’re making it seem like these recent ones are from China!  Stop startin’shit like u Guys always do.  Forreal!
If trained and highly experienced pilots can Not clearly identify What they are looking at, it should tell you Something Unusual is happenning
As always propaganda pushing !  Good job fake news CNN  👏
"Cruising at 40,000 feet."  It's called a jet stream. You can do it at home with a 50cent balloon 🎈 at lower elevations. Or a chinese lantern 😃
First shoot, then ask questions. This sounds like humans who have no brains. Probably USA. I guess the balloon is from Russia, because China would not do this. Accusing China before you know anything is like accusing black people because they are black. Btw, USA and China have perfect sattelites, so this is complete fake news.
CNN is full of shit, a military operation pilots who are highly trained and disciplined would not be speaking to anybody about anything.
Bullshit.
ALIENS.
CNN lies a lot
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Idiots pilots , could be USA satellite
Ignore this false narrative. They know and they lie
Don't worry if it was a UFO we will bravely identify it as a weather balloon.
Alien,s first Contact! and We blast them out of sky! Let the,, War of the world,s Begins!
China and Russia have a meeting about how the US is bringing earth into "Galactic War 1".
Sounds like SCIFI MOVIES are now becoming a reality !
How are the pilots accounts in the media so soon? We might have a security breach within our own. China doesn't seem to be a threat here.
Shut the hell up ….you tell me they can find Saddam in a hole but can’t figure out what’s flying in the sky
Is it just me, or does anyone else find it concerning that this object was able to fly from Montana to Wisconsin before being taken down?
They’re shut him up and threaten him to disappear….have we not enough data and documents on how the government hide fabricate and threaten the truth
Epstein client list dropped today❤
The next one should be approached by something like a E-2 so it can slow down and look
🧠💩 all psyops are fake until proven gay 🌈👽

PROJECT BLUE BEAM🎉
they want show you the pics because its a cover up story for the real news happing in Ohio!!!!
Why is the FBI taking the lead on investigating these things? I would think the military would take the lead on these.
The Chinese balloon was simply an oil company looking for oil spots in antarctic... blown off course over us.
UFOS are suddenly a threat now?
C'mon Joe- step up to the plate and hit a homer for Mankind- admit that these things are extraterrestrial.  Ignore the "Men in Black".
Great, let's see the photos. Where are the photos? Why is there not a single person asking for photos?
USA is losing war in Ukraine. thats why they need to shift focus too a "new" enemy or a object of attention
Looks like some sort of anti-gravity craft that uses the earth's magnetic field to hover in place, but looks like it couldn't control it's stability in air. rotating in random directions, as earth's magnetosphere interacts with the the craft's electromagnetic vacuum with too much force, hindering it's ability to maintain unidirectional stability.   The antigravity force of the vacuum is well known in Astronomical circles (Grδn, 1986, 2009; Magueijo/ 2003) . The state of stress in the vacuum is usually described with the analogy of two forces pulling in opposite directions and therefore generating a stress. As it is known, according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, there are always electromagnetic waves being created and destroyed in the vacuum of space. These electromagnetic oscillations are always created by pairs in opposition, in such a way that the vacuum shows zero net energy.    F-22 raptor and F-16 falcon interceptor pilots noting the lack of observable exhaust produced by the craft on thermal imagery weapon sights may be because The vacuum looks like it doesn't have any energy because the electromagnetic waves that it generates are all phase cancelled by other waves in such a way that the final observable result is zero, *remaining no observable energy to see.* However, the vacuum possesses, at any time, an incredible quantity of electromagnetic fields in opposition and this is the source of its density and high stress or tension.  Americans have been researching, engineering, and building crafts utilizing this principal since before the cold war. This isn't a novel piece of technology, however, the one shot down isn't American, or Canadian, and is too amateur to be of an intelligent extraterrestrial life-form.
Cruisin' down the sky in my '64 UFO.
I don’t understand why we are getting into a military conflict with Russia for the sake of a third world country like Ukraine? Who is Ukraine to us? To me personally, this is a distant country on the outskirts of Europe. I don't care what happens to her! Because of Ukraine, our prices have risen, taxes have risen, we are bringing our weapons there to this country .. why? Who is Ukraine to us? Maybe we owe something to Ukraine? No. It's time to think about your own affairs, and not about how Russia is in conflict with some country there. What do I care who Russia is in conflict with, and even more so I don’t care how Ukraine, Zelensky and some other political officials feel somewhere on the edge of the planet.
Alaska is the old Russian land of Russia. The United States in the past stole it from Russia by deceit. The US must return Alaska to the Russians, this is their rightful land!
So, the United States government shot down, peaceful UFO's from outer space, didn't it?  Shoot first instead of making peaceful first contact.  Geesh.  That's how you start interstellar wars.  Where's Zephram Cochrane when you need him? 🖖🏻
Guys I was just trying to fly my RC plane... Let me have some fun. :(
Man is trying real hard to make everyone think these are spy balloons when no one in the military is saying that they are balloons at all. When they easily could,l since they openly shot one down already....so yeah, I'm not buying what this guy is dishing out. Is china gov/mil  up to something?....of course they are, they kinda always are. Are they behind all this? I don't think so
Virus droppers ?
It's a cover-up ask your self how fast does a balloon go it is amazing all media house carries the same story in different forms oh yeah one more thing they know what it is I do not have time For this what's in the darkness will always show up in the lights timing patience 🌎🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
Man I don’t trust anything that their saying.
Make sure all you guys stick to the script. That way we can all be united when we start World War III and make a few more elites richer than they already are.
For myself , I am less worried about Aliens , than I am about our current governments..
Send the pilots over ohio so they can update us on that chemical disaster over there. I have not heard of one update or news on that
there are no aliens…fake alien invasion…CIA operation Blue Beam
No military pilot would made a comment on such classified scramble
What happened to the unitestate intelligent department???? What happened to the radar and all the satellite systems????🙈🙈🙈
These UFO"s have been seen for years !!    They can outmaneuver our aircraft very well apparently..!
Cnn sucks🤣
I didn’t watch this yesterday, these day timers are all fucked up
Debris.?  I heard today , that 'No debris has been found "...?  So which is it  ? Debris? no debris?
As I read through the comments it is so alarming how many of us have zero confidence in our government.  They talk about gun violence and like so many other countries don't understand why we have them the US citizens have them because we don't trust our government.  Everything is backwards. We knew intuitively that something was off with covid. We know we have lost faith in our law enforcement.  We know they fan and fuel the race issue. I hope all this insanity does its job and brings it all crashing down so we can be birthed again.
Fuck the balloons cover Ohio
They are here. They have always been here. The world is in a very dangerous state with all the wars and talk of wars going on.. Think about it!
in an age ofof ever pervasive  technolog, no pictures, no proof, just made up nedia speculation - yet in 100 years time those believing in aliens will still be saying  this was proof of aliens covered up by the government - all he usual crap for the gullible ............
One minute he says - no idea who sent them Then he keeps talking about China.   Imagine if it's a bunch of high school students playing with it.
We will see, they still have not told us what the objects are that have been seen in skys over Hawaii?
I do not understand this alien's fixation with America. Why not visit Asia, Australia or Africa. Darn it
Anything coming from CNN is never facts.
FBI is investigating..lolol We SURELY will be lied to now
Stark tech…
Lies lies lies
There are other balloons all over the World and no one else is concerned.  We have them down in South America.
Still think the hot air balloon was a publicity stunt taking us off the scent!
The CCP has long put spy balloons around the world, Xi Jinping will not know, shouting the loudest is Xi Jinping, shouting to prepare for war and fight, thinking that the world does not know about these mysterious spy balloons, the US government has also been pretending, the United States everywhere there are CCP agents and CCP sent publicly-funded students These are Communist Party members, responsible for infiltrating and monitoring overseas Chinese to create chaos and steal intelligence, the US government does not pretend not to know? Buy land near your military base, send people to scout military sites, teach students and threaten other overseas students to help steal technology, and this balloon incident also lies to the world with open eyes.
Anyone seen my DJI Mavic 3  ??
All BS. What a set up.  UFO and Aliens were always on the agenda. Another form of fear control.
ET is coming Back with friends
People, nothing to see here ... (you know the rest).
*The one most frequently associated with lying was a high intensity version of the so-called Duchenne smile involving both cheek/eye and mouth muscles. This is consistent with the “Duping Delight” theory that “when you're fooling someone, you tend to take delight in it,” Sen explained ....this reporter is loving these lies*
Probably a false flag for propaganda purposes...
Does anyone know if weather balloons must carry radar reflectors and transponders? You would think that anything travelling higher than a thousand meters or so would require them. Anything that does not carry them is illegal. Would this requirement not be a good idea/possible?
Aliens be like dont start world war 3 or we invade 😂….
Chinese government corruption is very serious! Cover up and connive the star class to evade taxes, launder money and fake data at large! Because there is a problem with the system of the Chinese government! Chinese officials are basically civil servants! However, such a star was directly elected as an official of the People's Congress without passing any civil service examination!
WWIII is coming. Thanks Dems...
WHO CARES ABOUT MADE-UP OVNIS !?!??! THey are using the ONVIS as a way to make people not think that OHIO IS ALMOST TURNING INTO A GHOST STATE DUE TO CHEMICAL POISONING!!!!!!!!!! There is almost NO NEWS about this, it should be on national news!!!!! People are covering things up since its very bad for their reputation, this is an abuse of power. The whole Ohaio could suffer irreparable consequences. For those chemicals to be naturally neutralized, IF it's possible at all... it will take decades if not hundreds of years, let's not forget that all rivers got poisoned and all fish and the like are dying within 50 miles or more! The water has RAINBOW FOAM on it!!. The underground water reservoirs got contaminated already, so all wells are unusable! And there is a risk of ACID RAIN, when it comes it will contaminate the water reservoir that delivers water through the pipes to each home, so TAP water will become poison!!. Lets NOT FORGET THAT BREATHING KILLS YOU THERE!! I HAVE SEEN VIDEOS OF BIRD SIMPLY DYING WHILE MIDFLIGHT!! I have doubts if there will be any animal and plant life left within a month. This should be on the national news and be reported everywhere. All animals/plants are dying there. Any bird that flies through Ohio WILL DIE. If proper measures are not taken, Ohio will turn into the FIRST POISONED GHOST STATE OF AMERICA. But instead they are covering things up like evil china!
This is just like the movies right before we get invaded
So if you don't know what it is then it's a Chinese spy balloon? Okay
These objects come from Wakanda. They’ve always had advanced technology.
These balloons 🎈 are launched by the high school kids
Where are the first images? The Chiniese spy-balloon images were there instantly.........! Why arent't more details given like their actual speed and direction during the rendezvous?  Combined with windspeed and direction the government could state it has active propulsion or not (which would make a balloon more likely).
keep reporting on the balloon so that people can forget about the ohio explosion, well done CNN. America has fall to such sorry state.
All baloney....what's really going on?  All scripted.
Oh good the fbi is handling it.. so we will never know anything because they are idiots
People people. Scenario 1, they are real,they have the means to travell across solar systems. OK. If that is the case, nothing, I repet nothing could put a dent on a machine capable of withstanding crashing into asteroids at speeds hundreds if not thousands of times ( in the least) faster than our fastest rockets. Would be like using pebles to break through a 10 megaton rated bunker. 2. The f35 jets are equipped with vr headsets and both the pilots and the feed is showing a deep fake real time (for the pilots ) feed. They think it is real because that is what they see on the vr/ar headsets.  3. The Americans have real alien or ancient technology and is only capable of imitating or replicating propulsion systems totally or partially without the replication of shielding technologies.  But if that is the case, running the risk of fallen debris being taken and reverse engineered by another country is too dangerous, they wouldn't do that. Hence scenario 2 is according to the laws of probability the most likely , deep fakes generated on pilots feed and "leaked" to the public.
Smells like bs
Old man already assuming it’s all Chinese balloons.  Talking before you’re able to confirm anything.
Under President Trump this would have Never happened
5!!!?? And how do we know it's China? Could b a Red Herring.
So they haven't collected all the debris, don't know where it came from, but there's "no obvious surveillance equipment"? How do u know?
By this time next year this world will be a totally different place,We are on the verge of a world war,
What’s not being said: government was criticized for not shooting down the balloon that drifted across the continent, so now suddenly the government is like “look at us! We do shoot stuff down!” I wouldn’t be surprised on if there wasn’t anything shot down at all, and the government is just trying to save face and project a different image to the world
Elon Musk is trolling the US Military. 😂
This China/Russia thing they're trying to keep going seems like a smokescreen.
Might be project blue beam. Stay alert people.
What inept reporting by CNN. " some pilots "  is this referring to the pilots of this intercept? Or some pilots encounters with UFOs in general. Where the aircraft of this intercept F-22s or F35s or both? At what speed did these aircraft approach this object and what where their relative speeds?  Was the object cruising along at 200,500,1000 mph or just along with the jet stream???????   The reporting details are not very detailed!
Look everyone Stop paying Attention to Hunters laptop and Ukraine and China and food prices AND COVID 19 clot shot injuries definitely don’t pay attention to anything Pfizer related this message was brought to you by Pfizer 🤦🏻‍♂️
Sounds like it's USA doing it  just to start a War. This is what happened in WW2 when USA put objects in the air around California's people felt threatened.  NEVER BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT!!!!! JUST LOOK HOW THEY LIE ABOUT RUSSIA AND THE LIES WITH THE AMERICAN FIRST NATIONS.
Dear Aliens don't fly over America they kill first asks questions later and do not represent humanity in anyway shape or form. We humans for the most are benevolent beings and we have the capacity for good. When you do show yourselves do it so all of humanity can see. Not just the military forces of this planet.
Why is the FBI involved in this, unless it all has something to do with blaming Trump.
"Pillar of cloud by day and pillar of fire by night"  - Genesis.
Uhhhhhh there was an object in the past on radar that traveled Mach 6, and we never figured out what it was?????
They know what it is.All garbage bs from the mainstream.💯. Aliens are demons by the way💯👍k Bubye now
Alien lives matter
It's a test you shot it down then they know that there is life on this third rock from the sun
The fact they were able to shoot it down tells me it's not aliens. Aliens with advance tech that allows them to traverse the universe without us noticing anything with out telescopes out there just tells me this is something local to Earth. Also, advance alien tech wouldn't get taken down so easily without a fight.
Distraction
Suspicious that there aren't photos of these three ''objects''.
UFOs.  The new distraction.
" did not appear to be self-manoevering." NOT Aliens, folks! Wake up!
Honestly makes perfect sense to me reason they would ramp this up with some leaders meeting. This is exactly what Russia did to Ukraine.
CNN = Cartoon News Network  This was playing already so I missed the source until the end. Time wasted. CNN = Completely Not News
Aliens don’t exist. I’ll tell you what does: tyrants, frauds, Rothschilds, war criminals, kleptocrats, oligarchs, illegal 3-letter agencies, unconstitutional Federal Reserve. The world is but a stage, as the Bard foretold. Everything is bread and circuses, smoke and mirrors. Look over here while we rob and pillage you blind.
UFO???
Why is the FBI even in operation? I would not believe any of they're lieing tongues. I have never trusted our government so there's that!
More BS from CNN.
So.... guys, I type in "Ohio CNN" on the search bar and this vid is the first recommendation to come up.... Yall already know what this means... FK
Insane how they aren’t telling us what these things are. Like what the fuck
Oh come on! This is nothing more than diverting the population's attention elsewhere! It is more than obvious.. 😕
Prepare for the end times, I feel like an invasion is ahead of us and nobody is telling us so we don't panic!!
distraction
So now all of a sudden we have the capability to shoot down ufos ?   Highly unlikely. Definitely not gonna shoot one down with a AIM missile and a sidewinder.
If it was truly alien in origin then we wouldn't have been able to shoot it down.  We likely would never have seen it to begin with.
This is so clearly a planned story right after the Chinese balloon. The uap investigations, CNN getting involved all seems abit fishy to me.
F-22 stealth coatings defeat alien jamming  and account for why craft do not try high velocity escape until it's too late.
A pilot can tell the difference between enemy aircraft and markings in combat but can't tell what they say here? They probably flew past it a few times and had a picture before shooting and everyone knows protocol makes them identify what they are shooting before they are shooting.  This is just a "we don't want civilians to know yet" weather it was another country or something we don't know about.
Why no photos of this object…before shooting it down they must have taken photos of it..even from their space satellites…and from the aircraft that shot it down. All their doing is talking about it. Prove it to the public with video footage, if it’s true.
The pilots are not talking! They can't. We all know this. CNN should find reliable and true information. She over here talking like she talked to the pilots on a personal level. My lord smdh
Train derailment story time https://youtu.be/lrYkqVTAykc
The shot down a couple of lawn chairs held up with helium balloons.
Fake happenings
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣            📰🗑📰
Gotta wonder if Trump already sold some documents 😳😳😳
An "Alien" invasion is coming. But it will be a false flag. The end goal is to create one world government. In order to do that you need to create a common enemy.
More distractions... So after the balloon now Alien suck lol.... Comon
A.L.I.E.N.S
Ironically this is all happening during the super bowl week.  Which keeps the sheep occupied on something else.
I will never understand why the spy balloon wasn't shot down over Alaska where there's thousands of miles with little or no population. The government knew it was a spy balloon, they said so. They let fly over missile sites and everything else. They waited until it was at the Atlantic Ocean. Why did they allow. I remember Biden said he told them to shoot it down and they wouldn't? What's up with that?
Biden derailed a train
Communist news network, cover the purposefully derailed train in Ohio the cia or China or billgates foundation derailed a train full of chemicals that killed animals in a 100 mile radius
Former usaf the public will never know what truly happened. And these news accounts could be all disinformation, that's how the United States Air Force works.
If it were alien wouldn't we see it enter the atmosphere before it even made it to where it was shot down...
The Fbi lies and does not have our best interest in mind. Period.
Please my contry ( Turkish bitcoin address 3FJXghq6NMfh77B6HTC9kDcpTc5qpU3Xrv - donation: need food
Well, fbi involved, we will never know the truth. Smh.
they only let military pilots talk if they want them to say specific things or cause a specific feelings in viewers. What are you up to, pentagon?
Conflicting stories? Because it didn't happen!
These things could be filled billions of deadly airborne pathogens so shooting them from the sky might not be the best idea.
We dont know if is intact....Yes,is like when it was flying.After been shot and falling from 40.000 feet.Wtf woman
Why don't they talk about the ecological disaster in Ohio due to a train derailment?. You should be inform to people, not distracting with stupid news
We still want the island list of pedos.
Americans you are playing world police for decades....dont be surprised to get attacked for Real. Im against war,but you shouldnt get involved in Ukraine and Taiwan....you made so many enemies,be carefull. You cant win superpowers like Russia&China together vs you alone....theres no way.
Imagine aliens landing on earth and are welcomed by a woke mob accusing them of being racist because they all share the same skincolor😂
Lets not mention at all that the US flew at least 10 surveillance balloons over China in 2022, because when it's America, it doesn't count, right ..... China has a long history of retaliation of exactly the same thing as gets done to China, i.e. you fly balloons over China, China will fly balloons over you.
These balloons must have been in the air for weeks or months. They just found out about it ?
I think when we are all burning in nuclear fireball, we will wish we never voted for these people.
My God who did they send to "recognize" the object? Did they bribe chimpanzee with banana?
PARDON ME, BUT THE PILOTS DIDN'T SAY A DAMN THING - THAT HAS BEEN POSTED AT LEAST A MILLION TIMES BELOW IN THE COMMENTS - THE PILOTS TALKED TO NO CIVILIANS - WE GET THE NEWS, FRESH PICKED, OUT OF SOMEBODY'S ASS - GROW UP PEOPLE FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!!!!!
This administration does nothing but lie, stonewall and deny anything they're asked or accused of.
another attention puller.....CCP biden needs cover!
First time in the History of the country that we have shot Down the enemy over this country. So Biden Administration has a new first. Somehow you know they are happy to be the first 😂
Billion dollar planes! Where are the pictures?
Fascinated? !Maybe it wouldn't be so fascinating if the U.S. would simply be honest in telling the public what it is.
It's a distraction the epstein list is going to be released. Don't fall into confusion.
Has anyone else noticed how they have changed this story several times. They did the same thing back in the 50's👀
And why would we believe these liars? (Government)
The FBI ?? Oh no there in trouble now..
Don't worry CNN knows what to say 🤣 😉
several jets flew to shoot down Chinese party balloons... now that is a great intellectual response!!  The USA is in Bidens good hands!!.
Hears another one.  Got to be Joe Biden flying that UFO .CHINA will love this .
The Deep State has secret technology and would like you to believe that the real beings of higher dimensions [~Galactic Beings and Archangels] are hostile. They use holograms so don't believe everything you see. Archangel Michael gave this dictation in 2017: saying 'THERE IS NO ANTICHRIST FIGURE IN THE SKY. IT HAS BEEN AROUND YOU FOR A LONG TIME!'.. THE TITLE IS 'If We Appear'.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGcuJo-l5sw&t=216s
those pictures were riveting, tarp, boxes, fans, boats, crime scene tape for extra drama
don't believe anything here. It's soap opera reporting w/nothing of significance. What qualifications does Natasha have to be a CNN National Security Reporter? She is qualified in talking w/o saying anything .. new WH spokesperson
How about you start flying drones into them this way you can track them?
CNN doesn’t know what they’re talking about. She said F-35, but it was F-22s? Pilots wouldn’t speak out about this anyways
Chill they are trained observers 😂
It's staged.
What if it's something from area 51 and they been waiting for this day to release it or what if it's just another spy object from China someone knows something
Pictures please.I’m sure our planes have cameras
We had constant daily coverage of the beautiful white spy balloons, but not one shot of this vehicle sized object has been shown yet. I wonder why that is
Magnetic proportion exist so can the balloons be coming over the USA so they can drop a gps signal for these so-called UFO
Wow I guess it came true military and Democrats and Elites are so scared that they have to go ahead and use their man-made UFOs to scare citizens also they can have their War
“Mr No Sense”, the CIA retired has been, had little to offer but war mongering comments.
this sounds like 1947?  Air force shoots down a baloon as a cover up to retrieve a real alien UFO.....hmmmmm, fooled me once, fooled me twice....
It has to be checked in lab, who knows? Might be a potential risk for contagious pathogens in it🤷🏽‍♀️
Charles Schumer said they're small balloons, believe in Chuck !
et phone home
What if Xi is losing power and the military is going to attempt a coup? Good point Jim
Frequency hoping Bob!?!?
Sad how they trying to hide what some already know
Klatu will reduce 🌎 earth to a burned out cinder
I'm an idiot in an internet chat, and so are you!
It must be sum ting making Biden look incompetent like we didn't already know that
They are trying to mix up uap language and balloons to muddy the waters. Typical in ufo history @DeptofDefense @SenGillibrand @MarkWarner @marcorubio @RepAndreCarson #uap #ufos #pentagon #Balloon Shot Down #Balloons #balloongate
Can wait to see tripods coming out of the earth.:)
When the pilots fires missiles at the UFOs did they notice any signs of shaking or legs, arms, heads, or long strings of intestines hanging as the debris fell from the sky?
We need to stop the CCP. Not let them bribe the president or his kid Hunter.
Does the presence of Chinese SPY balloon an indication that China can deploy a MOAB over USA space anytime they like, because this balloon was not spotted far away enough before it entered USA space?
FBI @ CIA how can they be trusted?
Yep that’s an alien
Alien drone👽🖖
This sounds like stuff from an episode of Ancient Aliens on the History Channel.
Shot down  landed on ice  pictures please China balloons alien 👽👽👽👽👽👽
It's good be from China ????
Xfiles in deed alien 👽👽👽👽👽👽👽
Ooh! Ooh! I know what it is! It's a Q Drop from Alpha Centauri, A message of hope for Trump.
Why are the FBI being so secretive with this. In the warehouse the pieces are covered with white plastic. Why?
If these objects are from another planet then we might have ignited an intergalactic war by shooting them......a great occasion for humanity to get united by a threat from outer space. In any case in the meanwhile the US government will try to hide as much evidence as they can. As always when it´s about UFO.
It's fentanyl express from China🤣
If it's not from this world and they perceive us as a threat we are fcked
Ufos are indestructable period. No jet fighter is going to approach such thing.
If it is aliens leave it to Joe Biden to get them pissed off. I guess any disclosure from this point will be at the end of a sidewinder missel.
Alien lives matter.
Natasha’s a smoke show wow.
We are being played. They know exactly what they shot down.
🤣🤣🤣
What are they not telling us 😂😂😂😂😂 do we have visitors to our planet or not 😅😅😅😂😂😂
It's BS. First came chinese balloon. Then came UFO. So coincidence ? Not in a million. It's just an act of distraction or diversion. They are just up to something no good.
No way in hell the pilots would identify or speak on this classified mission.
Anyone thinking aliens needs to chill. There's no way intelligent life made it here from another planet, just to be shot down by an F35.
We need to stop buying anything made in China.
bunch of lairs to take attention away from ohio chemical explosion and nord stream sabotage
What if it's not alien at all.What if it's really a drone craft thats used to transport drug shipments..And the long drones are being used  to sex traffic women or kids to other countries. We will have drones as taxis but the underworld uses them for delivery after crypto payments.. #Maybe
Lies
If China shows signs of panicking or being mad, then we know for sure what these objects are.
It’s definitely a coverup. The “Chinese balloon”  was just a smoke screen to cover up the ufos
If trained pilots cannot identify what these objects are?..😮
Local  iam sure ..Canada  Around some secluded area ? Chinese knows what's going !?? And our president knows alittle also  Austin isn't afraid of china military . But they want blood around America Russia sending balloons around here too engage china war fare with us
I always said there a lot of movies out there that really based on what going on in real world, and I feel they put it in movies because we think all movies fake an always say mane what if this happened fr but whole time it’s been going on. but look deeply in movies that relate to the world like in 2010 or 2011 they come out with movie 2023 similar to what’s happening now. But if you ask me it’s sad they brain wash all these reports and ppl that fly’s these jet’s an who have photos an information, but scared to speak what’s truth because what could happen to them or someone they love. Even worst they’re already be prepared for it. But when things go left they leave us in the blind side with late information that they been had 2or3yrs now
The world is that the octagonal shaped one had passengers in it. Aliens
If that pilot said it interfered with his system then it did ..they would have no reason to wanna lie .
Many people post on yt dreams and visions of the rapture ( aliens could be a distraction ???)
This is for a NORAD EXERCISE YOU IDIOTS
"Take Me To Your Leader"  Sounds about right.
Those aliens are weak, son!
WE NEED A NEWS CHANNEL THAT REPORTS WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON WHEN STUFF LIKE THIS HAPPENS….I feel like majority of the time the new reports this stuff the government just wants to distract us
No need to worry .... we have Will Smith .... he will go up there and smack the aliens in the face ..... then we all die .... HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
WAKE UO IT WAS A UFO FOR RESL !!! STOP GIGGLING LIKE A LITTLE  5YEAR OLDS THIS SHOULD HAVE SERIOUS ATTENTION PAID TO IT IT'S SERIOUSLY NOT A JOKE THOSE VIDEOS TO PENTAGON SENT OUT WITH THE FIGHTER JETS SHOWING A TIC TAC UFO WITH THE OTHER ONES THEY WEREN'T FAKE WHAT DOES EVERYBODY FORGET ABOUT THOSE THAT WE HAVE YOUR PHONE'S DOING UNEARTHLY THING STINKS THAT WE CAN'T EVEN FATHOM HOW TO EVEN BEGIN TO DO ON VIDEO TAPE FROM A MILITARY PUT ON TV ACROSS THE WORLD FROM OUR COUNTRY FROM OUR MILITARY AND PEOPLE GIGGLING AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN UFO THINK ABOUT IT IT'S VERY DISTINCTLY POSSIBLE GET READY COUNTED EVERYTHING ELSE OUT DEFINITELY WASN'T A PLANE A FEW OF THEM SAID IT DEFINITELY WASN'T BALLOON FEW OF THEM SAID THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE TALKIN ABOUT THEY DON'T DEAL WELL WITH THEY WERE THERE UFO'S FROM GOD-KNOWS-WHERE BUT NOT HERE
Alien attack this year is imminent.... Get ready for war of the worlds..
Biden fu..s up Chinese balloon response  and immediately false flags an alien invasion. I don't see anyone buying it.  The balloon will end his presidency.
Did he say there were 40 of those things all over the world? Interesting…
I call bs
We know CNN lie
China did not forget Pelosi’s  visit to Taiwan. That visit triggered the beginning of the war between the US and China. Pelosi herself caused an unimaginable damage and suffering to the world. Be all prepared because China wants revenge.
I seen one of those balloons over pittsburg,Pa just 2 hours ago
Here's some good news https://youtu.be/Wh1VU-_OF98
'Cruising" at 40,000 feet. Not "floating" as CBS news suggested. Wouldn't be a mystery as to what might be keeping a balloon aloft. It would be in the instance of a flying car sized octagon ball "cruising" at altitude using "some kind of propulsion system to drive it."
Why would it not make sense for China to act,  just because Blinken was going to China? Weren't Japanese officials meeting with US officials when Pearl Harbor was hit?
Let's stop the bs stop the lies its our brothers from other galaxy we are not ignorant
While everyone was watching the super bowl I was watching the sky an spotted 9 UPA/Ufo that mimic stars. I’ve seen them in Pennsylvania,Florida and Arkansas. Just remember to look up and pay attention
X files, here we come!
For you people will do anything to draw attention away from what Biden is doing to the world. Amazing. And I'm amazed by how many morons believe it's a UFO of checking out the planet Earth really. You think an intelligent life form when want to come anywhere near this barbaric planet
FJB. Fake news from that POS.
It's all propaganda. There were absolutely no objects. Biden is trying to fool the people.
I think Joe-tato sold us down the river. Maybe these objects are a distraction from LGB's treasonous acts (all of them).
What about photos? Can jets take quality images?
Alex jones was right
Rip alien 👽 🙏
This is two countries working together to now intimidate the US.Sound like we doing like Ukraine.Oh they just bluffing.But the whole time talking gone get us killed.
The fact and cold hard truth is they will never tell you the truth or facts about what it was they even shot down. They will cover it up like nevada and everything else. The government should be concerned that they have no real power and there is higher beings who control this planet amd the goofy government has you believing they are. They will be the firdt to go when they arrive. The jon believers and the ones who think there above all.
False flag. So the budget for the military could be quadrupled.
Cnn network went straight down the shittttter. You guys don't cover the real news that matters anymore just these bullshit storries trying to distract us of the real fucked up shit that's going on in this messed up country that's been captured by corporate america by endless amounts lobbying to buy our govt from top to bottom(including main stream media).
Why do humans always default to aliens? It's really embarrassing our species isn't more scientific. Why do ppl think objects have to have propulsion? That's the whole idea of balloons! Gas lighter than the gases in the atmosphere goes up.
I’m scared that Biden’s not going to know what to do when war breaks out. We need trump rn
Did anyone get answers, I sure didn't?
Trust me they already know what it is and they are just afraid we would try and mess with them.. which we would bc for one if it's not shooting or hurting anyone then y shoot it down loloh bc america is cold killers just like slavery and everything else america claims is theirs
So basically for us to find the truth we have to believe the complete opposite of what the gov. Tells us', bec we know it's a lie! Like there really going to tell us the truth about anything muchless everything! In the end we will always get the "it was just swamp gas over the oceans it was reflecting imagines there weren't really there🤣
Wow the lady news anchor needs to slow down. Too much coffee.
bullshit
Have we ever had a "normal" year?? If so, the last one was 2016...
UFOS.  JUST ANOTHER ACOSTA LIE TO DISTRACT FROM HUNTER'S LAPTOP CRIMES.
Man, this shit bigger than Nino! Ijs
Look into the train derailment in Ohio, that is the big story the fake news is hiding.  Major environmental disaster, that they don't want us to know about
At this point nothing is impossible no more, 2023 was suppose to be a great year but it’s not doing so well
this about sums up American paranoia.  had this removed earlier.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGYFRzf2Xww
I think the US is being played. These objects are most likely man made and they are being used to spread fear and anxiety to the public to cause all kinds of conspiracies shifting away focus from important issues. But they should not be ignored.
we needed a new news story, gotta sell them ads.
UFO Period.
Funny how the Chinese spy balloon subject is dropped conveniently now that we shot down "UFOs". Smells extremely fishy to me. Hysterical how we can let a Chinese spy balloon finish its mission before we shoot it down, BUT some unkown "object" we instantly shoot it down. Seems also like a convenient distraction from the Chinese spy balloon and any other thing going on. Distraction and dividing people is THEIR goal so THEY can keep doing the shady things THEY are doing. WEF just had its meeting not too long ago. Who is to say that this wasnt one of their alternate plans to accomplish THEIR agenda.
All I know is I tried to do my part. I walked outside and folded myself up pretzel style with butt pointing at the sky and farted. A few minutes later I saw the footage of the object over Alaska blowing up
It is pretty obvious they are just high-altitude balloons.  There are LOTS of them over the sky.  Many of them are flying around 60K above ground and flow around the world for couple years before crashing into oceans or barren land.  They have limited onboard power to nudge the balloons to a general direction but can not really control much other than control how they get crashed.    Almost all of these high-altitude balloons are equipped with solar panels.  Some have solar panels placed horizontally like the one from China.  And others might have the solar panels placed vertically.  So they look like cylindrical objects.  And some are complicated enough that they have multiple faces and layers.  So they look like eight sided objects.  What US military doing is actually violating the international norm about high-altitude balloons.  US itself, for example, under Project Genetrix, flew more than 500 high-altitude balloons into China and Russia territories and other nations.  And China and Russia are doing the same.  The national air space is around 30K feet above ground.  And international laws are vague about flying objects at 60K above.  Unfortunately, US military, politicians and media are sucked into this tragic fanfare of irrational thinking and reporting.  And the American public is being jerked around, like bobbling heads.  I really hope we can think with reason and realize what is going on.  And stop acting "surprised" or "outrage".  It is normal for nations to fly high-altitude balloons.  They might be spy balloons or weather balloons.  Just like low orbit satellites.  It is fine as long as everyone follows the same rules.  And unfortunately US is breaking it under its own national frenzy.  And now it is much more difficult for nations to fly high-altitude balloons which is actually a very good way for scientific research.  And yes some balloons are used for spying.  Get over it.
I'm afraid of the object in DC ordering the action
I bet it's just Elon Musk playing with more of his expensive big boy toys. Don't worry everyone, he'll get bored of them and move on to dip his toes into something else soon.
this CO guy...I could have those answers...
Why are Satellites not photographing them? They photographs our lands 60,000ft below but they can't photographs "these things"?

and roll in the CIA propogandists ...
With no obvious propulsion system, This is an overt show of force by China which shows that their technology is far superior than we think it is
PLA is not China's national defense force but a armed wing of PLA so stop bullshiting the world that some PLA  military general launched these balloons to spoil diplomatic relations between US and China.....Nothing moves in China unless approved by emperor Xie Jinping.....you Americans for want of business stop supporting these monsters who caused biowarfare through Wuhan virus and millions of deaths worldwide....

Stop your lying sir
Fake news. Ever heard of “Opsec”?
Hopeful it’s my people coming back to get me off this crazy planet!
These 24 hour news stations are complete garbage. Why not investigate and report, not guess or have so called experts with zero knowledge come on and tell us absolutely nothing at all?
The propulsion system is based on manipulation of gravity fields
More b.s from the west
If we see a UFO, shoot it down with a $35 million jet fighter and blame it on China.  We need a new war.
Shoot first, Ask questions later Intergalactic War anyone? 👽👽👽
It was a YouTuber flying his homemade jet car and the military mistakenly thought it was an UFO
Sure sounds like a whole lot of propaganda. There's an agenda here.
This is TV not radio/ Why do you always to show to the hoist? American TV I do not like
It was nothing said about a UFO, this is nothing but Clickbait
We’re talking about this… meanwhile in Ohio… Nothing to see here folks!  UFOs!!!!

Ojo la iglesia Católica, Prostestante y ortodoxa y la mayoría de las religiones del mundo temblaran si esto fuesen ovnis extraterrestres...  Como explicarán q hay vida fuera de la tierra?  Y claro se las inventaran diciendo q es la gran venida y q son Angeles o algo así. Pero, hello?!  Anyway esto son globos chinos o coreanos o quizás rusos quien sabe
CNN once again lied 🤥 to the American people
Pedophiles stringing us along with bullshit.
Los aviones del AirForce no tienen cámaras q graben eses Ovnis y así saber mejor antes de derribarlos. O sea si tienen sistemas de propulsión y cosas así pues en un vídeo se vería claramente.  Y no habría este tipo de discusión
The dead giveaway that it's fake, is the reporters in this segment aren't even asking why aren't there photos.??
If they are Aliens, they aren't going to be real happy with our government either lol.
If the balloon flew across the Mexican border, you wouldn’t hear anything about it. Great work?
This makes no sense. We flew up and identified the object then shot it down but we don't know what it was or where it went. Then ordered all Americans to leave Russia. No dots there to connect.
And here we go ,the fake evasion has begun....
"Hear what pilots said"   Just with that alone I know its fake as hell. Military ain't speaking on anything classified.
Surprise it takes time……..
Surrender to the balloons before it's too late !!!👽
Silence is revealing...
The truth is out there
🛸 👽
This isn't news. No content. No info. Just a lot of WE DON'T KNOW. Shut Up till you got somethin DAWG.
I'm not saying it was aliens but it was aliens 🛸🛸🛸👽👽👽
Where are the photo
Where are the photos
Where are the photos and videos you know they have them release
Preping you for aliens
Where are the photos
The government lies to us. News stations/media is controlled. We're being lied to. Its not aliens. It's government manipulation. We wouldnt have an alien invasion unless the government simulated one to cause panic and attempt to try making people more reliant to the government and or blinded by their bs.
Where are the photos HELLO Hello!!!
Why is our government not releasing photos why!!! Of last 3 sightings where are the photos!!!!!!!!!
So disclose is happening. This is the only reason why we’re being fed this by MSM 🤔
"very conflicting reports"  hardly conflicting saying they saw no external equipment to no means of propulsion ,  and wtf is the "peoples liberation army" ?
Lol this guy downplayed the shit out of this in every way
Whatever it is the owner is pissed
Call agents Mulder and Scully 🤣 💯
Wow really pushing the Chinese threat narrative. Riddle me this, why did china claim the first balloon but not these objects? If they had this sort of tech, something much smaller with no payload, why would they send the first one with a bunch of stuff hanging off it, and much larger? No, these are the very similar to the objects that Lt. Ryan Graves described seeing in the Go-fast and Gimbal vids. These are something else entirely than the first balloon. Something we don’t fully understand. I’m concerned with the talking head really pushing some ridiculous Chinese coup narrative.
Well if its not of this earth,then we are in trouble,we have destroyed each one
Great their already lying about it before they create fake pics
Mach 6 sighting...shelved because NORAD couldn't 'figure it out.' Hmm.
These things are Extreterrestrial origin (ET Probes of whats coming in the near future)...that is why they are not releasing footage or telling us the whole story it's a blantant cover up and they are just getting their ducks in a row to feed us their BS typical protocol...
FBI or CIA?? You should call the Man in Black 👽😂
Didn't the planes have cameras?  Where is the footage?  Everything has a camera now.  Why no photos?????
Alien Spacecraft
Stop Asian hate
It’s all in effort to fear monger AND you know when they say look left the right hand is up to something devious
Cause there was no “object”
I want to hear the pilots, not somebody's interpretation of what they said
Beginning of dozens of UFO conspirator theories that will last many years...
The best distraction from those classified docs and Hunters laptop.
Ufo
In national news. East Palestine, Ohio is being ignored.

Now im not saying, it's outer space, space aliens. but.  Aliens, from out space
So what I'm hearing is, Mulder & Scully are headed to Alaska.
Obviously there was a propulsion system? on what grounds? dont just talk out your ass. Media needs to get a clue and think before they talk.
858 billion budget and we don’t have any videos of said objects.   But Of course, what are we all thinking.  We should trust our government to show us the real debris.   😂
Obviously it’s aliens
China be hiring aliens these days
There is absolutely NO WAY this would be released. This would be a huge security breach and threat to the U.S. Smoke and mirrors to distract folks, pay attention to other things going on.
😱😱😱😱
Get Mulder and Scully. This isn't the first time pilots have seen - and recorded footage of! - ufo's with no discernable propulsion system, that make moves which defy the laws of physics. I've seen the footage.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The object?   Space debris that worked its way down/or was more likely guided by NASA into the lower atmosphere.   No propulsion?   Never did, it was always just floating around in the upper atmosphere where it was initially placed.  Amazing that the so-called "scientists" who work for NASA can't tell us more.   Perhaps that's because our government doesn't want the rest of the world to know what we're up to up there in outer space.   All those satellites orbiting around are just "taking pictures" and "monitoring the weather"?   Not hardly.  They already know what the "object" is because they put it up there and want to harvest them before a foreign power has the opportunity and figures out "just who is spying on who" ... reminds me of MAD Magazine's "Spy vs Spy" comedy.  This  all-of-a-sudden harvesting possibly triggered by the Chinese hot air balloon event and all the brouhaha, setting off panic by the US military.
yep 4k videos not the blurry face on mars type
So many strong telescopes to see even galaxy far away and they need to send some f/22 to see what’s going on …
Maybe the Chinese are actually aliens and they have far exceeded our technology.
eye witnesses report arent worth the paper they are printed on!
I don't wanna jump to aliens, but the conflicting accounts is suspect as hell.
Alien😂
Think about this! If you believe in other life in the universe. Man sends probes to other planets to explore. What if these are probes from another life form trying to look at our planet. If this is true, shouldn't we try to capture one intact and operational?  Government share the real truth and pictures and video! This would be huge, for mankind.
distraction, i almost forget the nordstream pipes
Garbage story.....  Who shoots what they can't identify ?
I doubt that a pilot would be able to shoot down and alien aircraft.  It would interesting it was something from an alien intelligence, but this is probably something man made. Perhaps China is trying to see how we would respond.
Damn Natasha 👀
Yeah the cia guy is on the payroll 🙄
What if the president was an alien and that's how these unidentified objects got into the U.S?...
The truth is out there. #Xfiles
Oh yes they said it's impossible how the object stays afloat there's no purpultion system wtf
Mach 6 flying object,c'mon now...dats Aliens
What about the train explosion in Ohio? Is all this just to drive the attention from Ohio explosion ?  Not even one serious image of this flying objects.
Is this their way of distracting everyone from seeing the Epstein flight logs?
CNN on YouTube brought to by China "Wake Up"
Oopsie she made a tiny mistake saying it was another Chinese balloon brought to US by the collaboration of Xbiden.
This is like Batnan in them 1960 ,Same Bat channel an same Bat station
Wow!!! Natasha is look very cute today
Why aren't we seeing pics like we did of the ballon.
If they are aliens they would not be shot down. We've been seeing these things for years.nobody shot anything down why. Not even reported as fact.
Sounds like a bunch of 🐂. Bull.
Why are they steering away from the communication disturbances  and what the pilots saw
What are the horses of the Bible? 🛸  Get into God's word to get understanding. There is nothing new under the sun. Get to the meat of God's word! 🍖 📖   Shepherd's Chapel Bible Study  "Horses Of The Bible"  Part 1:  https://youtu.be/FumupMoQO3E  Part 2:   https://youtu.be/gbBP7iU9b7k

Ummm.... Does anyone believe anything that comes out of cnn....
WOW ! I thought all these COVID protocols were just to enforce mask wearing because the STENCH of the Chinese because they're so OLD !! 🤘🏻🇺🇸🦅
It's A.ufo
C est vrai dommage que l on ait pas d image de ces ufo !! On aurait bien voulu voir
frequency hopping?
Govmedia distraction propaganda. Did he see a CNN or CIA logo on it?🤣🤣🤣
The Chinese have a space program better than NASA and space x combined. So if your don't know they do have satellites and don't need spy balloons 😂
I'm not saying it's aliens,  but it's aliens.
How to get to Heaven and be sure of it!  Every person has sinned (Romans 3:23), but God’s standard is perfection (James 2:10), any departure from perfection disqualifies you for entrance into Heaven.  Your works do not gain you entrance into Heaven (Eph 2:8, 9).  The Bible says that Jesus, the eternal Son of God became man (1 Timothy 3:16), lived in sinless perfection (1 Peter 2:21,22) and bore our sins in his body (1 Peter 2:23, 24).  He died on the cross (John 19:31-42) and took the punishment that we deserve.  Romans 5:8 says, “but God showed his love for us while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us”.  Then he was raised from the dead for our Justification (Romans 4:25). To go to Heaven and to be saved from eternal punishment, we must place our Faith in Him, trusting His death on the cross to pay for our sins, we will be forgiven and receive the gift of eternal life in Heaven.  John 6:47 “Verily, Verily, I say unto you, He that believeth hath eternal life”. You have a choice (John 3:14-18, John 3:36, John 6:40 & Acts 16:30, 31).  Put you trust in the Lord Jesus and be save!
Something tells me this is the beginning of the fake Alien invasion and fake second coming. This is just going to get more and more every day. Watch what I'm telling you.
It's freaking Roswell ALL OVER AGAIN!
Well thank God the FBI and CIA are on this because those are the two most trusted names in investigations, just like CNN/MSNBC are the two most trusted names in propaganda!
It's a shame they continue  to spin us like it's 1950. Man, if you  send fighter jets up to put eyes on it  and then determine  to shoot it down then you know what it is and how it's flying. It's 2023 we are not stupid.  Jets have cameras also.
they def have video of the object since it was flying at much lower altitude....?
Ballony. All heresy.
Unmanned, did not appear self-maneuvering?
ITS ALL A DISTRACTION!!!  news channels/reporters are being silenced over *OHIO CHEMICAL TRAIN EXPLOSION*
We will never know , they will say it was a weather Ballon.
Ufo's are nothing surprising. Military shoting them down is something new though.
Basement Biden's Build Back Hunter's Traitor Defense Plan
it's pranksters having fun
Nice, now we are shooting at aliens.
This is a planned attack that the globalist are doing to point look up there instead of down here what's going on. Fake
Is there a reason they wont say how fast they were going? Kind of a big deal detail.
https://youtube.com/shorts/zISlLsOwPrk?feature=share
Not to knit pick but frozen water has a name in the english language. It's called ice.
Mats attacks
The USA has declared war on the aliens. The rest of us are not involved. So please aliens, only abduct & stick your probes in Americans! Thank you.
Conflicting accounts= coverup.
its most likely a weather balloon off course its not a flying saucer
US is easy to penetrate
What if aliens are here to warn us about the destruction that we’re on the brink of, but we keep shooting them down
Imagine thinking this is true, Project BlueBeam is coming
I am afraid that some foreign power could be sending over some major VIRUS,  thus when it's shot down, the VIRUS falls into our atmosphere
Just send Mulder and Scully , they will find out everything .
Let’s go say hi.    Gets shit down
Alien invaders?
Obviously ETs. It's not the first time they've been here. Maybe They're ramping  it up now because they see that with our ignorance, territoriality, greed and general mistrust of each another, we're on the brink of self extinction. Maybe they want to help. If that was the case I'm sure we would never find out. Our military can only justify its bloated budget when it's shooting stuff down or getting us involved in a war somewhere. Paranoia and aggression pays the bills.
The people want the truth we want live photos of the recovery before this gets barried and its just a mystery we talk about 30 years down the road which then turns into a conspiracy theory
FALSE FLAGS LEFT AND RIGHT LOOK OVER HEAR DONT PAY ATTENTION OVER THERE....CLASSIC
If we can shoot down the ufo , trust me there were no aliens in it , aliens would be far to advance & would most likely never let us get that close  ❗️now when we shoot at one of those things & it suddenly disappear then we have a problem ❗️
GREETINGS FELLOW HUMANS...INVASION OF PLANET EARTH WAS MISSION BUT AS SOON AS WE RESEARCH OF PLANET EARTH OUR INVASION WAS CANCELLED CAUSE HUMAN ARE KILLING EACH OTHER IN THE NAME OF  SO MANYTHINGS ...SOON EXTINCTION   OF PLANET EARTH WE JUST NEED TO WAIT ....
Alien craft by past pilot videos show that alien craft are far to advanced that piliots can't keep up with them.
Any bodies inside?
Imagine if they couldn't shoot it down.  Then I would be worried.
ET PHONE HOME !!!
Dam a Bloom going Mach6 I knew them Chinese were advanced but dam were screwed
A "balloon" like the one that was recovered on a ranch in NM in the late 1940's.
"The truth is out there"
Hello men in black
Aliens are here
This is why I refuse drugs
Can Area 51 investigate our current presidency because they dang sure have no clue about anything other than they’re apperently winning the fight against themselves
Y’all make anything up for publicity
Jim Acosta reporting--enough said.....The air force jet should have shot him down instead ! what a Doosh
I think they want to be sure before they release partial or incorrect information.  Cool your jets people it's probably not aliens coming to harvest you.
So it was a slower moving stealth or visually like space ghost invisible but  not perfectly at times cause I saw them yesterday...over Florida I'm not tripping..
“Hello we come in peace!” “Foxtrot 13 you are cleared hot!”
I'm going to laugh if they shot down a xenomorph ship
I'm thinking these are decoy devices to see how the US reacts to them. Especially after shooting down the Chinese balloon I could see how other countries might be curious to see how we react.
Question, so the US Government allowed the pilots to speak freely? Uhhh
It was shot down but nobody can figure it out,  I call bullshit. CNN needs more ratings so let's make it more intense and drag it out.
Liars
We are doomed with a revolutionary  war. People don't need to be in a mysterious ways. People don't  want to be left in the dark  with the other half.  ( government) That leads  to war.  My dad when he was alive. Used to follow the news like the back of his hand. He predicted  911 terrorism.  He predicted  things going to go cheaper. ( internet buying). I say people now are getting fed up with not being able to live a decent  life. War sucks we all know that.
Get ready for the chit storm
It's aliens!! The invasion has begun! Our alien overlords are testing the waters! 😏
Chinese, dirty knees, look at THESE!
Oh no aliens ❤ look, it’s a way to cover up a cover up. Let’s just leave that be for now right? Until more happens and we have no real room to do anything but run.
The aliens have come to Unite humanity 😂😂
Yeah I'd love to "hear" What the PILOTS have to say. NOT What cnn says they say... CCM..  deceptive headline.
There lying is all a deception by satan and his children of rebellion.
2 Corinthians 4:4 kjv 4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
Speak out said it it's not from here
They said it looks like a Hunter Biden painting
Look American I'm here to say that this ufo that ppl say are the creator of the human species and they are afraid of the human species nuking there own self cuz this is where they can stay for now since they been here for so many yrs. But who am I to say this is true just my thoughts of mind.
So it  said f22  but this news person is say f35..  which is it.. red flag possibility?we are in financial slump. Ready for war
US Gov't:  "If its something normal and boring originating on this planet we'll let you know. If its something fascinating we'll hide it away for us to dissect and tell you guys it was just a smaller surveillance balloon leaving people to speculate for a hundred years until legal action is taken, a council is formed, more debate for far too long, couple documentaries and self-proclaimed experts for good measure and we end up with a few grainy black and white photos." So lame.  How 'bout just show/tell us what you saw for F sake! Its 2023, can we stop playing this game. The people from the "oh no, the sky is falling"-era, have all died or been voted out.
North Korean UFO.
Uh oh, did we shoot down a UFO?
was a Mexican UFO
The four horsemen that were just released from the Tigris Euphrates are doing this. In order to fulfill the 1/3 of mankind being killed, The four horsemen are getting the US and the China in the groove of firing at each other. Wake up!!
They are full of shit.
Cap. Distraction.
That was my small Fiat. Some government owes me a new used Fiat.
Need to fear monger once again for another fake war.  Not like anyone specific predicted this next step decades ago when TVs were only black and white.  LMAO
They will say what the master says. Who's the master at this time I have no idea.The only master I have is the Lord Jesus Christ.
Different rules should apply to politicians and oligarchs. They should be exempt fro certain taxes or rules.
More like a UFFO....UNIDENTIFIED FALSE FLAG OPERATION. Anyone following this has no ability to comprehend realistically.
Independence day coming soon
Those fighter jets have cameras on them, so they have footage of the objects that they're not releasing. They've also recovered part of them, so if it were a man made drone or balloon they would know by now. It's either alien, or a foreign government has tech that the public isn't aware of, and if it's the latter then we must have the same tech, otherwise that foreign government wouldn't have risked it being confiscated by the US.
Flying at Mach 2, they saw shit nothing. Can you see shit at 100 MPH in a car and the item is 1/4 miles out or 1/8? Planes can't stop like a car Duh! Not even Much recording options on a fighter for zoom unzoom. Anything going past anything at 200+ MPH looks like a streak of shit from a toilet. Duh!
This is ridiculuos, there was pictures of the chinese balloon instantly and it get recovered in a couple of hours, this is obviously being  hidden from general public
Sir, how many cocktails have you had here?
Bulshit!!
Aliens...
It was a party balloon from Party City. But made in China 😉😘
Eeeeeew, couldn't determine the propulsion system of the balloon...ah, maybe wind?
I'm not saying it was aliens, but it was aliens. 👽
I'm not saying aliens...but aliens...
Flight of the Navigator
How bad is it that I trust Chinas take more than CNN?  We all know CNN is just a propagandist for the Democratic Party
If they're saying it's not aliens then we better watch out because it is
If the FBI is taking the lead in the investigation there will be a coverup.
There goes xmas
they'll recover it then we'll never heard anything about it ever again. Simple
Dont worrie people we will all be working till were old nothing exciting going on here just more hope of something exciting that mabey will happen but never does
They want us to belive in alians agenda..first milions of holywood moovies about alians too prepare us and now its on the news..
Probably staged. Trying to save face for the travesty Biden's term has been thusfar
Lies and more lies
"IT"S A TIK TOK !"
This is not China.. not Russia .. not terrestrial.. these are alian probes collecting data on how we will defend ourselves .. they are also flying over China (they shot one down as well) this is just the beginning I'm afraid
I finally get to go home!
Distraction to what rat Biden caused in turkey
Why is it taking so long for “ them” to tell us what in the UFO is going on??
I guess our technology is about to advance drastically in about 5 years.
Oh, this is stupid. UFOs are UFOs.   Project Blue Book, where are you?
This talking head is such a Tard…
It was a balloon 🎈 simpletons… Stop watching this garbage
Demons…or angels!! Aliens from other planets don’t exist. Everything you have ever been told about our history/the government/pharmaceuticals has been a lie! More people have to wake up before it’s too late!! 🙏 ❤️ 👽 🚀
They're messing with the wrong country
ET gone wrong. 😳👽🛸 Nahh.. people from other planets in God's universe don't need machines to travel with, nor do they need to probe or spy. They can see everything down here from where they are. The people in the other worlds are called:"the sons of God"in the book of Job. They are perfect beings who never sinned. They are not hideous with big round heads, green or blue, saucer like eyes or reptilian. That's probably what we look like to them after over six thousand years of sin...
It's a glitch in the simulation. The hardware is old and breaking down.     Yesterday I saw a guy drying his car in the median of the highway like he was still at the carwash.  The NPCs will be acting weirder and weirder.
This is a distraction from something
Uh oh! I’m getting the same vibe as when they told us Iraq had weapons of mass destruction! The Military needs an excuse to increase their budget!
Lol no pictures?  No video?  This is all such bullshit.
I don’t believe anything CIA owned CNN says…
I think the Chinese are winding up America.
Yo why u got to be shooting down spaceships and shit humans be the one's killing each other and shit what on earth is happening here?
What I want to know is why are they reporting this stuff now, when this has been going on for years and has been covered up and denied. This is what needs to be addressed.
Listen to the comments by former pilots. They question the validation of pilots even being allowed to talk about this and the cameras that are mounted on these aircraft. There should be some really great footage of these so called objects. Again don't trust what we are being told. The left and deep state are covered in lies.
Stop blaming China. You know too well the other 3 has nothing to do with them. This is an extraterrestrial attempt to contact us and say they come in peace.
Find it hard to think pilots would give media any information about their targets before it’s official release. I think someone is blowing smoke up someone else’s tailgate
All of this is sounding like a major Summer "EARTHBUSTER"?! 🤗🤣
Aliens, totally aliens 👽 they shot down the damn tictac 😆
Nah. Its just China.
It's probably part of Project Blue Beam...look it up
Distraction.  Mainstream war cartel wants to bend the script and distract the public so they can continue using chemical weapons on Russians.  Hey, it's your taxes being burned up in Ukraine (Brandon's 51st state)!
You're fake news
Objects were a diplomatic peace delegation from planet Zontar. I guess we’re at war again.
fake and lies once again
In short, the Chinese are trying to developed a weapon both for surveillance and carry bombs silently and least detectable to a US target! What else are these balloons intended for?!
Dimocrats are bad for America.
Yall need to get a life wishing it was Aliens. I swear get some excitement in your life go into nature or watch a movie.
So they could have dropped a nuke over our states...now they know that.
They’re going to find in deep in the ice and the beginning of John carpenters the thing begins 😂
Let’s see what kind of funny explanation they will come up this time! Roswell was a meteorological balloon 😂😂😂
I was thinking FBI?.... the X-files???  That Mach 6 is hypersonic like Darkstar and didn't Russia say they have ICBMs that can are supersonic or go Mach 6 or supersonic capabilities?  China has been working with Russia  in Ukraine locating civilian drone operators and giving their GPS  locations to Russian military so they can kill them. Probably spying through Chinese manufactured drones and other electronic devices. All government offices need to rid out all the Chinese junk.
Propaganda at its finest  No footage Made up charts and flight paths  I don't believe anything  Especially from Corrupt News Network  Demonrat stooges
Nice
Great call shooting down the alien space craft, now we can all be murdered by beings not of our world. Good call guys
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:  21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.  22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,  23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.  24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:  25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.  26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;  29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,  30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
Probably a balloon from an alien birthday party.
After UFO or whatever it is the  USA / Canada have shot down .. after that what did they see ..
China CCP leaders are enjoy lies cover anothers lies again and again try to fool the world. All spy air object are coming from China CCP army group. It may carry chemical virus(Wuhan virus etc) or bomb next time. U.S. must send out strong action right now.(Not just talk). Ban all U.S. investors enter any China stock markets to let evil China CCP make profits from any U.S. sources. Ban all China app(TikTok), Ban all China CCP pay system(Ali pay, Union pay, Wechat pay etc)  using or join pay system in U.S. base on homeland security reason. Ban all China CCP members and family enter U.S. forever. Ban all China CCP agents using  fake international I.D. students enter U.S. Ban all China agents and followers any activity in U.S. to show off their power. Punlish all China CCP officers inculded Hong Kong which meet crime of agaisnt human right acitivity. We must take action right now before too late.
this shit didnt happen, keep your eyes on bidens treason
What are the Americans  up to now?? What is all this leading up to??
frequenzy hopping. debunked. all pls back to work. probably nothing. great stufffff.... hahaah
Why no pictures?
No flight control ..uh..we don't want to report anything either..
These fighter jets have cameras onboard....lets see the photos.
Will we ever know what it is at the end of the day?????? let's see.
will we need a vacine and wear mask
Sorry If I am wrong,   I feel this is made up....   Ukrainian , Russia war  Turkey Syria earthquake,  And they are blaming Chinese ,  These US military depleted Iran  And now imposing it on Chinese without  any proof
CNN sucks. Full of so many lies it’s crazy! 😵‍💫
lol ,let's be real here ,even if the FBI or anybody with authority finds out that it could be Extraterrestrial..we will never know that..But here is some food for thought that it's NOT A BALOON..we have all seen pictures of the 1st Chinese BALOON and also whomever shooting it down.. but none of the last 3....lol
UFO 🛸 great
CNN IS SHIT
So we cant have Iron Man, but maybe a cylinder man
US Military: "Weather balloon. "
Are we shouting ballon’s because we don’t know how helium works?
Sounds like beating a dead horse instead of covering the immanent Release of the List.
hello earth we come in peace.BANG.
They're either Russian, or this is all nonsense.
Don't let this distract you from the Epstien list of degenerates they are supposed to release.
baloney for yankee
So, still believe in RELIGION ??? Where exactly  ,,god"  fits in this reality????
Ufo ..
Surveillance agent: Ohh crap, look it's a UFO US Army General: it's not a UFO, it's a chinese spy balloon. Surveillance agent: ok, the balloon is moving in circles and went back into the ocean Sir. US Army General: 😒
Rothschilds made all wars. Zion Protocols.
Crap news network
Whose ever object it was I wonder how they feel about their property being destroyed?  Was there a living being in the object or was it electronic strictly. 🤔. Like did we harm some lifeforms or just their electronics? Say it was from some other life from some other planet or wherever if we keep shooting em down it's not going to make them very happy with us. .. something to consider.....
They're HEEEEEERE!!! 👽
I guess E.T. is finally going to make an appearance, yall better TOOL UP ASAP 😁😁😁
🇨🇳 or 🇷🇺 or any enemy of freedom is looking at defenses and what is protecting the artic if they came from that end. That is the closest point of entry.
IT'S all BS,  Watch there going to try to pass emergency money and raise the deficit
Who the hell cares
Lies, Said, The blind mouse
It just another way of distracting the people on what is really going on. The head and neck theory.
Canada and the USA  need to upgrade their defenses in the artic hemisphere.  This is where the next major conflict will be held . There needs to be a joint military unit that needs to be deployed and stationed in many areas of the artic.  In my opinion there should be a artic alliance setup like nato .   The defense in the north is poor.
Reading the comments here from right wingers makes it obvious you people have an emotion and then assume whatever you think is true.  It's not.  Stop making up fking conspiracies
Ufo and baloons! Are we in 1947?
“The president owes the American people an explanation, direct and on camera, of what we know about these ‘objects’ and what steps he’s taking to protect America’s sovereign airspace,” Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said in a statement, pointing out that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada took such a step over the weekend. “No commander in chief should hide behind press secretaries and anonymous sources in a time of crisis.”

At stall speed of an F-22, the pilot would pass a 20' diameter object in less than a tenth of a second. Should have gotten the F-35B out there.
If it’s an alien object the government will 100% lie and let the news say it turned out to be another Chinese ballon or something or anything they will do whatever they can for the public not to know about this the government can all go to hell with their lies
I smell Bs. ALLLLL bs
Preparing gor an Event. Laying the groundwork? Testing?
Maybe it was a time traveler?
"FBI" here means MIB.
SURELY THERE ARE PICS FROM BOTH JETS. THEY DON'T JUST CARRY GUNS
Sounds like a coverup
Nothing more than a Weather balloon Folks. Move along Folks nothing to see here, 🙄🥴🧟‍♂️
Let's learn from independence day the peaceful approach is never a good idea.  Shoot first ask questions later.
Was it a balloon with classified documents inside?
Smells like “Operation Mockingbird” is alive and well. This is a distraction. Don’t be fooled.
Dude they shot down E.T.
Bet it’s a sphere in a cube.
a flying saucer
Hunter Bidens laptop has taken wings.
The aliens have arrived 😱🛶
My question to USA is this. Do we know what's   in these mysterious BALLOONS. How do we know they dont contain something inside  them. Could it be they sent these balloons  intentional so we burst  what inside into the air.  I know it theory but makes you thi.nk  2nd how is it why they  are  easliy passing our satellite which was design for thibgs like this not to happen. Let's go people get it together.
Truth war needed I am willing to stand up for the truth ! Are you with me ? I care -I suggest you review my post !
Mr Trump refer you to be fake news 😅😅😅😅
😱😱😱😱👽👽👽👽  Acosta still works for CNN?
I think you United States should be careful, Because they may send a balloon that they want to have shot down with hazardous materials or gas that spreads through our air and contaminates our air or rain systems
Hey is that guy your interviewing the pilot because if not you didn't tell us anything about what the pilot said... Media companies are worse with click bait than anybody else.
I'm starting to believe life is better on another planet👀
They don’t know shit about shit. They will make up a story and Americans will buy it, hook, line and sinker?
Screw the FBI the FBI don't need to cover this case it should be the CIA
China sending their balloons 🎈 to study the alien UAP activity 🤷‍♂️ seems logical
Lies to hide something bad they are hiding form the public, its a distraction, if CNN is telling you this its bad news somewhere else.
Talk about conspiracy theories 😂🤣
Great.  No one trusts the FBI
This is a diversion
National Geographic is people going to make a midnight show blaming it on Aliens. Lol
I hear it was close encounters of the xxx kind
THE military fly out the supper bowl game yesterday was a wonderful thing to see.
Im not saying it was aliens...but it was aliens 👽👽👽
The FBI does the analysis? We don’t have engineers in the Air Force?
They said they sent F35s but it was shot down by F22. Fake news
Why CNN is not reporting about what is happening in Ohio?
Lol CNN  always full of 💩
I guess the world should be preparing for battle of Armageddon, the Most High YAHAWAH is about to destroy everything on this earth and save His people and take over the earth that He created
Why not the DOD investigating this?
Shouldn't of shot it doWN!!! It's a balloon ,  dropper Where u like .. inspection... They don't Want us to know,,, r food,  Utility's,fuel, ,banks, farMland being Bought up by chinA..... Need trump more than EVER💪
Oh please, a ufo shit down by man🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. Never!!! Just stop!!! It's China or some other MAN!!
Look over here instead of at what is actually going on...
They shootin down run away birthday balloons 🎈 😆 🤣 😭
🤡
I'm p
FBI is taking the lead?   Hahahahaha   Get Bob Baer.
I'll bet whatever it is it's Russian because we screwed up that Nord 2 natural gas pipeline to Germany!
Send in agent scully
The balloons are being tested by the British military. What better place to test them than across the airspace of two of its closest allies.
These are dangerous times to be an alien just cruising around Earth's atmosphere.
I think they probably won’t say much cause if let’s say it’s another life form. We would have so much panic it would go sht for brains up on here.
I know what it is. But I'm not telling. It's against Starfleet regulations.
I had to come see the comments. Wtf is going on.
The Chinese balloon is to investigate these unidentified flying objects I guess
X files will be back on Netflix.
NOPE…
There was only one object & it was shot down over the Atlantic Ocean, after it had traveled over the entire USA. These other objects were fake news & never existed.
Trump 2024 please God !
It’s a Alien Probe from outer space but possible made in China😂
Where are the pics?  Don't they get videos or photos of some sort before they shoot it down?  No detailed information means don't alarm the public...strange indeed...very X Files
they shoot things but they dont know what they shot?
If it's the aliens, we're done for sure.  If it's China, the shitstorm is coming.
If it doesn't say "made in China" then it's alien's tech
Maybe none of this is actually happening and humans are losing their minds?
I hope they bring some galactic weed!
What this tells me is that China or Russia can get a nuclear warhead inside America without them knowing
My two theories: Some new experimental technology or aliens.
Doesn't surprise me when the Navy admits to radar data, video and visual reports of UFOs/UAPs regularly and they don't bother to shoot them down. This has been going on for decades off both coasts.
"hear what the pilots said"......? You didn't play it or even read a transcript....
China thinks it’s America. America thinks it’s China. It’s aliens. Be afraid.
False Flag event right on schedule, can't control people with Covid fear anymore so bring on the UFOs. So funny it took days to shoot down the Chinese balloon because they lost track of it and it was dark that is just not plausible with the existing technology. Our government knows everything that is launched from anywhere in this world and can track them at anytime.
Probably Costas relatives, are they green or gray?, just curious. We know he’s an alien, except NOT intelligent, you know like that family member nobody talks about, yep that’s him.
I'd rather have it be a Chinese balloon than something other worldly. We know what humans are capable of hear on earth, as for anything else that's out there. You might be poking at the wrong bear...
The F.B.I.  that's a joke  haha
It’s not China
It's likely the opposite of whatever CNN says.
Is it possible Dr. Steven Greer is correct about an upcoming false alien invasion.  Seems to me this could be the beginning everybody’s talking about UFOs now
I Want Life to be Normal Again......
Something not earthly I don't think they are a threat to us we are the threat
Lol in an era with satellites that monitor everything everywhere you people are going nuts over balloons as it's an actual threat where space technology has been watching everything you do for decades and y'all don't say or fear a thing. Grow up and wake up to what they really are doing.
Xi not she.
My bet is Raytheon/Lockheed are making and releasing these new high tech 'dummy' balloons  so the USAF will expend a lot of missiles shooting them down.   It's a profit game _ which is why the MBAs that run defense companies make the big bucks.
😂you think they will tell you truth!!?All comes from “their” mouth are lies!
A load of bullshit all a cover up to hide something else like stupid Ukraine war or the Biden family crime's
It's Wakanda
Fake news CNN and their efforts to get more viewers. This garbage was suggested to me due to their globalist parters algorithm-aka YOUTUBE! NEVER TRUST ANYTHING THEY SPEW UNTIL YOU HEAR OR SEE IT WITH YOUR OWN EYES.
Let us not forget about the identified object that blew up in East Palestine Ohio!  That's the real news!
Setting up a lie 101
No voice recording, no pictures, no video of the object being approached by the plane. This is just more lies and manipulation to make the public afraid and supportive of more military spending.
I’m pretty sure they can take pictures! CNN is just filling space with WAGs. Wild Ass Guesses.
$1,000,000 to shoot one down
America knows what it is nothing alien its China making a move before the wprld final war
They are lying to you since Roswell
This isn't a f******g spacecraft.  I hate the way the media are implying this and conflating the recent and well-investigated UAP episodes and this. It's a partially-deflated Chinese balloon that takes-on odd shapes at altitude. Seriously. It's not a coincidence that it arrived and was tracked from Alaska -- precisely where the high-altitude air currents from the Northern Pacific / Bearing-Sea come inland. The timing by China relates to the announcement of new US Philippine military bases.
They are here 🛸
Occam's Razor folks. The Chinese are testing our air defenses for holes and weaknesses. Plain and simple.
"Conflicting accounts" - because the planes have no cameras, no sensors, nothing. We rely on eyewitness pilots only.  Not believing a bit of this smokescreen.  The information just cannot be shared with the public, so CNN goes into speculation overdrive, fueled by 'experts'.
Fckn USA! They fire even if they don't know why!!!  Now they say UFO, few weeks later they will say it was russian or chinese spy thing. As always USA try to make troube in this world, generates conflicts around the world. Imagine an alien civilization who travelled from light years to Earth. Do u think a stupid jet will shot them so easy? And of course no evidence just stupid news.
USA #1...yahhhhh
So was there living things in the aircraft? Did they kill what was in it? Or was there no body operating the aircraft ?
Et come in peace ! America blow it out the sky
I think they said CNN stands for Communist news network!
We have become immune to everything else
Pilots would never disclosed sensitive information like these without goverment´s authorization.......I don´t know Rick, it looks fake to me!!!!
it is necessary to design and apply a non-destructive capture of the objects to facilitate their analysis
Waiting for the right wingers to blame it on antifa.
Thank God Trump is not in charge. If he wanted to nuke a hurricane, he might have nuked all these objects over and over.
Let’s see the pictures and videos
Funny how the “spy balloons” were immediately attributed to China, while these other objects are being kept hush hush. Very possible that these are Russian in origin and they don’t want the general public to know…
any information coming from this administration, if any, is only disinformation. they will lie every step of the way-= total confusion.  we will never know the truth.
But where is the pictures and videos of this UFO
Rather than sending the planes to Ukraine, America and Canada are chasing the objects around?
Aliexpress,

Roswell 2023
It was a 73" Buick Electra. I had one, I know what they're capable of.
Whata load of codswallop!!  Just trying to divert attention from some other serious issues coming !! 😠😡
Yeah, lets talk about this instead how the US blew up Nordstream
Understand this...everything being spoken here is complete utter bullshit. This is nothing more than a distraction or a complete lie to set the stage for an agenda.
We need Trump back
All smoke and mirrors
Bs
Fake news again!
We are living in the last days right before the rapture of the born-again Christian church. All the signs that the Lord Jesus Christ, who is God, predicted are coming to pass.  “For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.” - Matthew 24:7-8 KJV  “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy” - 2 Timothy 3:1-2 KJV  The Holy Bible says you are a sinner headed for eternal, burning Hell. You will perish unless you repent to God (agree with him that you are a sinner in need of a Saviour) and place your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ! Jesus shed his blood on the cross, died (and in doing so he paid for all your sins, reconciling you to God), and he rose from the dead on the 3rd day. Place your trust for salvation solely in Jesus Christ today and be saved!  “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” - John 3:16 KJV  “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus… Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.” - Romans 3:23-26, 28 KJV  “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” - John 14:6 KJV
As a town in Ohio is literally being poisoned by a toxic cloud this is what u people call news.   Great job tv watchers.  The msm loves u all.
Aliens warning the west to stop its war footing towards nuclear war
Aliens warning the west to stop its war footing towards nuclear war
"No identifiable propulsion system" - oh, a balloon. "They did not know how a balloon was staying in the air" 😳 - look, I don't know the science lads, but that's what balloons do. 🫡🤤
That Ship that they shot down better not of been part of the Arquillian royal family. 😤
It's Elon's Tesla coming back to earth😂
Cheese fell from the moon you idiots
Proyecto blue beam , asi de facil .
Thanks sleepy Joe for taking a whole week just to shoot down the balloon.
Heck, I can guess just as well as this guy.
Perhaps the next time an unidentified flying object with no obvious propulsion appears we should attempt a capture of it at least mostly intact.
Oh, Jesus! We just started a war with aliens! I thought all these things were "balloons?" Now we are being told a pilot could not determine how the thing was even flying?!
Cnn is such a joke.  Nobody day has any reason to trust these haircuts.
They don't respect you
why even look for debris? just scoop it up in a giant air plane. pluck it out of the sky. then you can dissect that shit and reverse engineer it. how you gonna know what it is if you mash its corpse. this is starting to sounds like 9eleven2 my butthole puckerchew.
“Roger, returning to base. This should distract the public” over !
OVER-REACTION(s) to an UNDER-REACTION. We let a spy balloon over-fly the entire US, so we shoot down 3 seagulls over Alaska. Brilliant.
Usa at it again and the gullable public will believit all bahhhhhh
Alien
All  this about  OVNIS are  just  Smoke and  Fake ...  A distraction  from  Something .   I  certanly  know  that   is  not  true.
If a pilot can't identify how a balloon is flying I am terrified.
So there's all kind of objects and it's flying not floating but flying so they could be droping what ever into the airspace on our country covid some kind of worse pathogen or who nkows  what !!😳 and it's been going on 3 xs trump adminand now 4 so far this week and so ya X-Files or attacks on our country 🤔 who knows oh and China is angry that our government did something how dare we like Russia mad at Ukraine dare to shoot back how dare they protect they're countries .just incredible how dare we..
👽🇷🇸👽🇷🇸👽🇷🇸👽🇷🇸👽🇷🇸👽🇷🇸👽
Thinking from a human perspective. If we landed on a new planet full of people without being noticed we'd most likely do our best to leave the place without being spotted. We'd be thinking about so many things like how would we even introduce ourselves ? My point is we'd either be scared and stay unnoticed or we'd invade them just as simple as that so if they truly have been around us for a while & haven't invaded us then that could mean they are studying us doesn't matter if it's for a good cause or a bad cause.
WELL LIKE ALWAYS WHEN CNN DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING THE TALK BS !!
So you saying that China is so advanced that you don't know what you shot down🤔🇬🇧
Foo Fighters
Regarding balloons vs.unidentified, a balloon travels freely on the winds, Roswell was explained as a balloon after weeks of recovery from an accessible desert floor. Ummm🤔🤔
Why would any country use balloons? Don't you think they outdated slightly ,what with satalites up there that can see the whole world lol
Good divert off the ufos elsewhere  and just keep talking about  the balloon 🤣🤣was close one lads 😅😅😅
Hopefully this doesn't start an alien invasion.  Sounds like they are describing Alien technology.  :)
Funny how this guy, without knowing anything, asks: why does China do this, why China that. Why doesn't he ask: why are the US telling us such a fairy tale?
Well Bob,,, at your and my age, we get Absolutely Fascinated by our TOE NAIL FUNGUS!
Yet we the USA has Chinese spys running us government agencies
"No identifiable propulsion", if it's Chinese or Russian we're screwed.
America playing tricks again u won't fool the world this time
Acosta you amateur, CNN FAKE NEWS GUY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON CNN PLUS
Acosta completes the JOKE
Hey, CNN. Why don't you cover the massive toxic cloud hanging over New Palestine, Ohio? A Norfolk Southern train derailed spilling tens of thousands of gallons of toxic cancer causing chemicals which the local police the intentionally detonated making the place look like a wasteland- nevermind the risk to farmland, and human and animal life. Why aren't you covering this? New Palestine, Ohio!
Pictures ? BS
FLY-BOYS PAST & NOW ?? Nothing else man can conceive Is more luring but God's sky. To be as one with the stars Is the wish of all who fly.  World War-I gave us the fly-boys Who flew by the seat of their pants. Many would never return from war While others survived by chance.  Their planes were mostly canvas and wood Gasoline, bullets, bombs and poison gas. Every pilot carried his own pistol Wearing leathers, scarf and goggles of glass.  Aviators had no Parachutes To escape their burning plane. Many were forced to jump to their death Or self-inflect a bullet to the brain.  Blimps where known as battleships of the sky The roar of their engines gave reason for fear. They flew so high they were hard to shoot down Hiding above clouds till their targets drew near.  Tracer bullets for the first time were used In the guns of airplanes to set blimps afire. The skies became man’s highway of death With duty and honor their driving desire.  How many fly-boys have we lost since then Those days of the Great War and more? Where do we get such brave souls of chance Who rise from the rest in the battles of war?  By Tom Zart Most Published Poet On The Web!
Klingons on the starboard bow, starboard bow, starboard bow.
When ever have China or Russia realistically provoked the USA,... How wars are America involved in directly or by proxy over the last 20 years again..?? Who is the real threat to the world here..
She clearly just said what it was. Another Chinese spy drone or balloon. Then she said ohh ok shouldn't say that. There's no way it's a slip of the tongue or a mistake. There's no such thing as mistakes and coincidence in these situations. Often these liars forget and spell the beans. That's how stupid they are
We were chilling at the high altitude when they shot us down. It's very humiliating for us to go down like that. Never again!!!!
all of a sudden they can shoot down UFOs. & surely there is gun cameras or something?
What a load of Baloney...
i love this  donkey shit ass american propaganda, its so stupid and unlogic like iron shit from turtle ass !! they made problem from this and say  what is this 4 UFO-s , like this army assholes didnt send immediatelly soldiers or whoever on the place where UFO-s are crushed and they know exactly where they crushed  so again jornalists wtf you talk about
Klingon
What do they all mean they don't know WTF IT WAS BULLSHIT THEY KNOW WHAT IT WAS OUR USA MILITARY JET PILOTS ARE FLYING THE MOST SOPHISTICATED LIKE 1.2 BIL DOLLAR  RADAR AND CAMERA EQUIPPED JETS AND NOW THE PILOTS HAVE CONFLICTING REPORTS ON WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SAW IN THE SKY WHEN THEY WERE FLYING RIGHT NEAR THE DANG THING SOMEONES BEING TOLD TO KEEP THEIR MOUTH SHUT they know what's going on and they definitely know what it was they WONT RELEASE THE EXACT DETAIL OF THE OBJECT CAUSE IT WOUD CAUSE MASS HYSTERIA IN THIS COUNTRY DONT BE FOOLED PEOPLE
Sooooooooo aliens
Anyone asked the Russians if the objects are theirs?
Alaska has been known for the most alien abductions of anywhere else in America. Just saying...
You can't believe ANYTHING coming from this administration or CNN.  Shooting down something they can't recognize? Really? Handing over debris to the FBI? Why not NASA or maybe the CIA?  This whole narrative stinks sooooo bad!.
I don't believe they don't know what it is period...
Pilots say what they've been told to say.
HUNTER BIDEN!!
wtf pilots need to say at all about this?? just go where fackn objects are crush down and see wtf you shoot down?? wtf you journalists talk about ?? nobody of this  idiots didnt think that this UFO if it is shoot down are somewhere on ground too and i dont believe that  army didnt send immediatelly   soldiers  on the place where this object are crushed
Are we still living in 1945?  We have high speed, high resolution cameras.  Why on earth are we relying on "eyewitness" accounts at 40,000 feet? LMAO.  I call bullshit on this whole story.  The airforce saw everything, down to the small print that said, "made in china" on the flying object.
FINALLY, THIS CUBANEX GOT A JOB IN STUDIO.
They need a GIANT distraction .The people of the WORLD are awaking !!! But not soon enough. Monetary system about to collapse/change  ! Total surveillance is about to  be implemented . Wake up, wake up before it is too late . They are creating these events in order to benefit a few, with enough power so they can excuse and impose the NWO .
I'm getting sick and tired of the misleading  and dishonest lead ins to get us to watch your  videos...I was expecting to actually hear radio communication from pilots.not once did you give us what was supposed to be  there for us to hear...your  getting as bad as the liberals.
Why is no news outlet interviewing agent Mulder?
So they have no pictures before they shot it down come on the govt def had the pilots take pics of it
B.s so if they couldn’t make out what they shot so how they hit it
U.S. government, FBI, CIA, CNN? I feel confident that we will be told the truth. 🤣LMAO
Just the U.S. government fucking with the citizens. Classified Documents no longer in the news.
This has a strange familiarity to the explanation given about the crashed weather ballon they found out side Rowell ?
Imagine being that alien 👽 in that craft and The US SHOOT you down and it took you hundreds of years to arrive here 😮
Why shoot it FFS?
Aliens > Russia/China/US… We are doomed! 😢😂😅
They act like they've never seen a flying electric hotdog cooker before. Its simple, the electrodes just poke into each end of the hotdog and you turn it on. In 30 seconds you have a national security crisis. They put coleslaw on them in the east. Now that's unbelievable.
wow they cant even get the type of planes used she said f35 and reports say f22 and no the military will not say what it was they shot down  or show any video or pictures and why hasn't anyone else seen these ufos i think its a coverup for biden
Time to bring the alien’s democracy and our western values 🧨💣💥🔥🪦
What’s in it
Great way greeting aliens...🤣. Let's hope we dont pay that
Did we just started a war with aliens ?
So these million dollar fighter jets don't have onboard cameras on board..we can't even see pictures
Who's ready for the fake alien invasion?
Some group of dorks drone club has the sheep scattering...😂
Does any part of the UFO says *MADE IN CHINA* at all?
Another alien coverup!
The balloons could carry disease ,  invasive species etc.  Can we stop 500 000 balloons? A million?
The amount of lies the government tell us is disgusting 😒
The inexistant object you mean?
Hope it doesn't turn out to be a white beagle on a doghouse..
Omg aliens 👽 lol 😂
Planned planned planned
Corporations launch balloons for scientific purposes all the time. I suspect were paranoid about everything now.
Ok. I confess. It was me. Just jokin'.
They can’t net these things & bring them back whole?
Stuff been getting weirder since David Bowie died I swear.
Fallen angels they shot down…….
Is America staging this??
Where's the video?  They must have one to justify what and why they shot down what they did.
It looked mettalic.
👽
Why would you say these are all Balloons?  They are not!
These are simply objects from rogue states. I hope they don't pose a risk to aviation.
CNN just feels like propaganda....
Alien caught lacking
How do you have declassified nowadays air traffic communications i call bs
Things were better, safer and cheaper, way cheaper under trump. Even during the pandemic. That’s a fact. Only  3 out of ten Americans disagree with me. And those three work for the government. Don’t believe me. Just take that crooked finger you always point at people and yell and scream at them. And scroll on your smartphone. The polls are easy to find.
WHY NO ONE I MEAN NO ONE  IS  GIVING DATA ON THE SPEED?
Certainly there would be pictures, videos, information gathered off the tracking.
When you start stumbling over the definition of ice as “frozen Water” you know they are lying to us.
Could someone be testing our detection capabilities or making us spend lots of money to shoot down cheap targets?
People are sheep. Dont believe everything you hear as the truth. The government has alway s lied to us and it will continue to do so.
No way pilots couldn't identify what it was, unless it were *aliens* 👾👾. Though, the latter don't allow themselves to be shot.
Ask Elon, he knows everything.....
I hope its aliens. Take me away baby!
Russia and China must work closer together for the sake of the better World!!!
Welcome to earth Aliens....Merica
Unfortunately, I had deadly, violent experience in my life. I know the reason I am alive today is because I striked first with massive violence. SHE IS CONDEMNED BY GOD TO BE DESTROYED FOREVER IN ONE HOUR, BY GREAT VIOLENCE. Smoke rising over her will be seen by those at sea, but they will stay far away from her to avoid her PLAGUES and DISEASES.
They say, the FBI is taking lead. No wonder: It's a case for Mulder and Scully...
Why doesn't anybody consider North Korea? China and Russia have satellites, NK doesn't.
The 'mysterious' balloon? 🤣😂🤣
Did anyone think to ask the nerd squad at Area 51 if all the little gizmos started light up or not not ?
It's called project Bluebeam. More fake news.
At the site of the UFO flight, an inscription in the interplanetary Cyrillic alphabet "Russia is here forever" was found
We will probably never know much.
I think aliens are spying on us, so they can land there airships and slowly take over America and than the whole earth. First they sent us technology like ours and than they send their more advanced technology to send a message. The probably need to probe us some more for faster results in their alien regime. Be ready to be stabbed in the butt with future syringes.
they should at least release a picture when they find the object.
Still dont believe in aliens untill i see footage
I’m worried
An imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire already knows we're here.....
Surely reconnaissance aircraft would have taken photos and videos if they were at those altitudes, And why aren’t they showing them?   Why aren’t the pilots being presented at press conferences?   This smells of a big cover-up.
Shoot down ufos fast but take your time with identified flying objects (chinese spy balloon)………
Let's unpack this quickly.  First I'll tell you I am career US Air Force with 26 years experience. I'm an aero engineer and drone expert as well.  I have to step in and bring up two significant points that are not being covered. First is that this could easily be a COUNTER-intel program which parallels actual SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) collection programs.  We know there are SIGINT programs going on we just verified the one off the East Coast.  We should ALSO expect a counter-intel program as a cover for these known spy collection assets. If 'they' (enemy) want better odds at slipping their large and expensive collection assets past our defenses one way is to fill our airspace with many many balloon type objects. Design them to be seen (Mylar reflectors and geometric design to reflect radar on purpose and lower altitude).  Then while US defenses are busy with these distractions the REAL high altitude SIGNIT collection assets go about their mission unmolested.  Next we have the question of "Why did they do this just before our diplomatic visit to China?" This is an ignorant question because these airborne assets from country 'X ' were likely deployed weeks or months ago depending on altitude. This is a non sequitur full stop until we can verify these were under guidance AND propulsion (which has not been verified).  We need more data to conclude anything beyond this full stop.
Joe Biden's pilots are a little rusty. But no problem they sure as hell know much more about Critical Racist Theory! Laud ham mercy cheerden ☻
Our government is a big !!joke!! lol Biden /Bush will be known for shooting balloons down😃
This stooge is totally dismissive of the fact that it had no visible means of propulsion. He’s acting like that’s either false reports on the part of pilots or it’s not important. It’s the most important part retard! It’s technology we don’t have and in the wrong hand could represent a very dangerous nuclear payload delivery system.  This guy is nothing more than a cia spook.
Cnn wants it to be aliens. Not another stain on biden lol. What a joke
We all know deep down what’s going on. We just are so used to saying”nothing out there just humans”. I always read how the ancient philosophers talked about man and his unwillingness to change. It looks like we’re going to be brought to the light even if we are dragged to it kicking and screaming.
If they are of extra-terrestrial origin, it's not a very intelligent tactic to shoot them down before knowing what they are, given that UFOs are created with advanced technology. Not the best way to welcome alien visitors, if that's what they are.
After attempts and ridicule from the whole world, knocking down the Chinese ball, they are trying to shoot down their own launched object in order to make amends with their people and prove that they are still safe) The Americans, as always, are in their repertoire, only everything is beautiful on camera)
WE ARE ALL GOING TO FUCKING DIE NOW. ALIENS ARE COMING.
It is Russia and china trying to get info now that Trump can't give them the information
Please be aliens
If this is a craft from some other country im sure by now they would know it has gone offline
It's aliens
Dirigible?
China playing cost effective games. Balloon cost $500. Rocket $100000+ jet plane +fuel +maintenance + man power to us.
Looks like ET won't be going home!
Stand down people it's just Elon Musk up to his old tricks Space X files
Meanwhile dont even mind the derailment of the train full with carcinogenics close to NYC. Focus on the UFO and the classified information we just talk to you about. Fucking NPC people will believe this shit tho.
Dark days are ahead...Mulder and Scully are actually still on vacation. FBI will not have an easy day on this one!
Yeh they don't know what they were shooting  at bs
Stop the bull shit... it's eather ours,  the Chinese or Russian.
Someone Playing with Us Big Time!👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿
Fake news!! Dont be distracted by fake ufo bs because Jeffrey Esptein list came out today!! Go look at the list!! Wake the f up!
CNN sucks.
China wants Taiwan  because almost all the electronic chips are manufactured there, and they want to gain control of the technology production sector, that will hurt U.S economy a hell lot more, they are definitely trying to do that, 1 million percent.
If it is aliens, I'm sure they are laughing at how confused the Earthlings are, the misinformation, and the political divide. All of this chaos and they haven't even invaded yet? They're like, "This is going to be a walk in the park. At this rate, their gov't is going to keep lying and keeping them in the dark for so long, that by the time they actually do see us, they are going to insist that we are Russians or the Chinese even though we're green."
How is it no knows anything
“I’m not saying it was aliens, but…..aliens.”
PLEASE READ THE THREE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS IN THE LINKS DOWN BELOW THEY ARE ABOUT 10 MINUTES EACH AND ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU LEARN THIS AND HOPEFULLY SETS YOU OFF ON YOUR JOURNEY TO THE TRUTH ABOUT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD  AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE BIG DISASTER, CATASTROPHE THAT IS SOON TO TAKE PLACE AND HOW OUR GOVERNMENTS SETTING IT ALL UP TO FOOL US AND KILL US. ALL this was premeditated and the pilots duh are in on it and as far as these fruit cakes sometimes they get word through contacts and such and sometimes they genuinely just dont know and read whatever report the are told to read. Can you believe this guy saying its impossible for American intelligence to get inside these circles. Ok buddy obviously you forgot about the documentary they aired which of course I watched. And we had that chinese dude who found where covid came from and specifically what lab building over there in damn china and thanks to this documentary we also learned that OUR OWN GOVERNMENT KNEW ABOUT IT BEFORE THE OUTBREAK WHICH WAS DONE ON PURPOSE AND BY THE LOOKS IT THANKS TO THAT CHINESE GUY WHO FOUND OUT SO MUCH AND THE DOCUMENTARY PEOPLE FOR AIRING IT. NOTHING THE OUR Government DOES WHICH INVOLVES KILLING THEIR OWN NATIONS CITIZENS HAS NOT SURPRISED ME AFTER WHAT THEY DID ON 911 OUR OWN Government HAS BEEN KILLING  US FOR DECADES THEY HAVE A  High POPULATION PARANOIAWELL NOT THEM DIRREPARANOIA THJ LLLBut trust me this is all leading to a larger unveil and all kinds of surprises for the public which they may not like where all this is all leading to. These actors are hilarious I cant believe that  "they" still believe people still buy their "put on repeat" same old song and dance BS  and what is this actor mouthpiece talking about we had a chinese man from china who gave us all that priceless information about Covid and a little more than we bargained for with our own government being involved and knowing all this was going to happen because they were the ones who probably help fabricate and create the covid-19 along with along with working with China and tell him to play along with this outbreak she was a lot of people don't know is is that a government is working with China's to take us over and control us. That's what the whole covid things about it was an experiment on the public as usual  they always do these things right in front of our faces out in the open and sigh people are so naive and trusting well with these people being like that is only gonna people killed.THERE IS A GREAT DECEPTION COMING WITH THESE SO CALLED ALIENS WHICHS ARE NOT ALIENS BUT MANUFACTURED CREATURES  SOULESS NOT MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD ABOMINATIONS MADE BY SATAN THE GOVERNMENT WORKED SECRETLY WITH CHINA TO CAUSE THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC OUTBREAK  BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPERIMENTING ON US THEY WANTED TO SEE OUR RESPONSE TO THE LOCKDOWNS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY GATHERING DATA ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BECAUSE BELIEVE ME THEY ARE PLANNING SOMETHING HUGE WHICH IS GOING TO KILL A HUGE AMOUNT OF US AND THIS WILL ALL BE TO BETTER CONTROL YOU CONFINE YOU Manipulate YOU AND CLOSELY MONITOR YOU ITS ALL FOR CONTROL YOU WONT BE ABLE TO TRAVEL YOU WONT BE ABLE TO DRIVE YOU WONT EVEN HAVE FULL CONTROL OVER YOUR MONEY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SHUT YOUR MONEY ACCOUNT OFF IF YOU GIVE THEM A HARD TIME OR DONT COMPLY IM TALKIN TO THE POINT OF IF YOU WANT TO BUY A HAMBURGER BUT A PERSON MONITORING YOUR ACCOUNT WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO BUT THEY WILL TELL YOU A LOAF OF WHEATBREAD WOULD BE BETTER.  gullible open and face tells some bullshit story about it being rain when it's really them pissing on our heads. DONT LISTEN TO ANY OF THESE PEOPLE THEY ARE HIRED ACTORS TO PERFORM ON THE WORLD STAGE why do you guys think that recently had all these issues come up in our country he's right about people being treated wrong and some guy dying who can't breathe and riots and chaos and Discord and fights over who's a boy who's a girl what's a woman all that b******* was planted in our society by our government they have people they tell what to do and they go and do it and then make a big deal about these things this is one of the oldest tricks in the book guys come on when are you when are you going to learn set the Doctor Who's treating your wounds and helping to save your life is the same Doctor Who mugged you in a dark back alley and cut you with a blade this is what they always do why haven't you guys caught onto this yet I'm younger than probably most of you and this is so easy for me to see they want you to strata they want you to fight and argue and bicker about the stupidest things that don't matter. Fastest can see them laughing now about it as they did it seem like we're going to get them to argue about the stupidest things possible and I bet you they're going to do it and they're going to take the bait and they're going to be distracted by it and this all of the sudden outta no where group LGBTQ wants rights and force everyone to talk a certain way and you think its coincidence that they just so happen to be talking about taking your guns with along with all this other stuff that they got distracted by deliberately purposely doing so to benefit their plan that they have got going on why you think they want your guns so you guys something such a hard time and give him hell when they're about to do what their about to do. Come on people wake up open your eyes can't you see that they're setting us up for a huge fall all of this to their benefit it's going to decrease population for them and they're going to blame it on some damn solar Cosmic happening  when in reality it's going to be them our own fake lying murdering kidnapping  government you should all be grouping up together stacking supplies Gathering and mixing supplies it's some sort of resistance community that we should already be preparing so that it'll be fortified & all ready to go when they initiate this soon. People don't understand the horrors that they have ready for us starvation to killing each other over a water bottle the cannibalism all while those government officials and people in power hide underground in their bunkers that they have safe and ready to go for their families to live in and after the right amount of time goes by and enough people are dead they will come back out to the surface and control you which is going to lead to the One World Government the Beast system and you will all be more than happy to comply after going through what you just went through some of you might be so desperate as to never experienced anything like that again by taking a mark don't take that Mark died first at least thing I have a better chance at eternal life and a glorious place then giving up your eligibility for that and trading it for an eternal life in the worst place imaginable the Lake of Fire guys don't believe me they even have government documents that layout directions and protocols for soldiers that are going to be the ones holding us like prisoners in our own country has anyone seen RoboCop 3 it's going to be just like that don't believe me about the government documentation will hear it for yourself and see what conclusion you come to this link will be for the government document it will be a video early man explaining a little bit about the document and then reading the document of course he cannot read all of it I think because it's pretty lengthy and gets really into intricate details a lot of you are not going to like what you hear in this document but I encourage you to at least watch the whole video it's not that long here's the link. https://youtu.be/jK54Wy1CWcc https://youtu.be/vKZMXAHHhUc https://youtu.be/8Xh-dtUp-uo PLEASE READ THESE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS (IF YOU LOVE THE USA) AND BECOME ENLIGHTENED.
Here we go again another Roswell coverup. Let's hope the aliens don't get angry and take revenge on America. I've been hearing the X-Files and Twilight Zone theme music in my head all day long.
The military shot down their own drone lmao😂
All the space movies coming to life now...
This is definitely surveillance equipment they are studying us, planning to attack. This is no UFO from another planet, being stationary like that it's a setup don't be fooled, they are plotting against us, this has do with the  takeover of Taiwan they want the electronic chip manufacturers, I'm sure our government is smart enough to make a smart move before them..........
Americans afraid of Balloons? Pathethic.
I love how @ 3:20 the ex-CIA (our supposed intelligence 😂) says "obviously there was some sort of propulsion system driving that vehicle" as the header below him says No Identifiable Propulsion 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ plus he says we need to find out if it came from China or Russia - apparently old school agent that thinks if it looks too weird then it must be from more technologically advanced countries like China or Russia (Russia? Really, technologically advanced?) as we a zipping by it in F-22s but being actively jammed? $50 says nothing is ever "recovered" officially.
I’m sure the administration will soon determine what everyone should be saying.
If the components in these objects are very poor quality copies of western technology you know it came from China.
Researchers say this was done by Japan military aviation complex.✍️  As per one official document, a futuristic technology which Japanese scientists hold might have carried the Chinese weather balloon to the American mainland to cause a nuclear conflict with china..! The report also says the motive could be taking revenge against Americans who dropped nukes in Japan twice..!!!
was it from Mars you think ?
How did they know it was safe to blow up
i find it weird how we send signals out to space so other beings can find us, like nasa and stuff like that but when something weird appears in the sky we shoot it down and kill it some signal that lol
i saw other news reports saying we have russian and chinese warship off the coast of the us surrounding the united states .... are these reports true as well
I heard it was a new trial for Amazon delivery? These news readers don't actually know much at all
CNN sucks
Finally, technology greater than American technology. They figured out gravitational wave propulsion and stabilized nuclear fusion in a single object. The tungsten titanium alloy objects are also remotely controlled by 8.2G communication from anywhere around the world including space.
ET was shot down.😢
Well, we do have UFOs visiting us frequently  https://youtu.be/-BwQ0gpW0Ew?t=297.
Americans are hallucinating... This is not the first time..  First they hallucinated severely before Iraq war.. They were seeing chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction in Iraq daily.. Later we knew it was a hoax to attack Iraq..  Same hallucinations are repeating.. this time against china..  As per artificial intelligence observations, here are a few things china has to do: 1. Stop building conventional bombs and build only miniature nukes. 2. Sell all conventional bombs or gift it to allies..and maintain a zero stock of conventional weopon policy..
WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVES THE FBI WILL TELL THE TRUTH THEIR STILL HIDEING HUNTERS LAPTOP
If China has the capability to fly without obvious propulsion systems at Mach 6, why the hell are they flying these ridiculous balloons?!
Someone contact will smith
Great way to promote the upcoming u2 tour!!!!
The guy is reading what he's speaking..look at his eyes when he speaks
Biden NEEDS to get in front of the camera and tell Americans exactly what object (balloon) #1, object #2, object #3, and object #4 was!  Until he does, Americans will be filling in the blanks, which never turns out well.  Problem:  "If" he does speak, will he tell the truth??
It’s from the planet China.
I reckon it was Superman.
The Chinese always took advantage when an official from another country will visit.  For them that is the perfect timing to violate someones sovereignty because that country will have a weak response due to the planned visit.
My great uncle's cousins dad served in NAM, he was in the 69th tranny division. Each Sunday morning he cooked up a cup of Joe getting ready for his mission, he swam in the swap waiting for any vietkong to jump out & ready for action. God blurss Amurica 🇦🇫🙏
They shot down an alien.
Welp, it’s time to bow down to our new alien overlords
3 years ago I first witnessed the same phenomenon in Bangalore,India I was not sure what it was but it was even glowing in the dark certainly it was not diwali nor it was a balloon because the white spot did not look like a normal object it was moving very randomly it had no sense of direction it did not seem like the ISS. I felt it was a huge junk of space debris that was floating due to gravitational anomaly of moon and the earth.. Surely I do not know what it is until now.  I witnessed this before the COVID situation could even arise.
The Russians shot one down as well some weeks ago! There is something going on…
These pilots would not have given any account of the missions concerning these objects...CNN is full of shit.
Disclosure is close
This link will make the balloons become more of a concern to you than ever before.    https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_electromagnetic_pulse
man you tell them stop telling lies, the truth is coming . Its on the way, the whole universe. UFO'S are taking over now. Americans are covering it up. they talking about balloons. that is crap. everyone knows those pilots shot down a ufo. yea the first one was a balloon, but that second one over alaska was a ufo. no forms of propulsion and it played with one of the pilots sensors. open your eyes people. dont be fooled, where you think all this technology coming from, they are reverse engineering recovered crafts. why you think they still havent said what it was.
The fact that they are shooting them down let's you know they know exactly what they are and what they're doing. And a missle shot down something the size of a small car? What would be left to recover?
UFO
Stupid af they need to stop hiding shit
Forget the “all of a sudden balloons” how about the invasion at the southern border?
Entered the realms of fantasy - who can come up with the daftest theory & keep a straight face ?
Ahhh shit Mars attacks
So nothing? Y'all know nothing.
🛸
Duh when will these guys figure it out?? IT IS THE RUSSIANS TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE CHINESE!! THE RUSSIANS  WANT US FIGHTI G WITH The Chinese  so they can take Ukraine
Every UFO story ever described the object as breaking all current understandings of physics. Now all of a sudden the US government has shot down 3 in a week. No possible chance in hell, if this was foreign this was either a Chinese or Russian aircraft.  More than likely it was an American aircraft. The media is leaving door open that this is an extra terrestrial object to distract from the ecological crisis that is currently unfolding in Ohio and the very credible report that the US was behind the nord stream pipeline blow up. The pipeline explosion is the biggest man made environmental disaster in human history! Also, the situation in Ohio isn’t something to down play. Before this view would be called a conspiracy theory but it’s important to remember that now we have main stream media acting like it’s a possibility we shot down an extra terrestrial aircraft.   Another question that needs to be asked why were these aircrafts able to be shot down over remote areas but the original Chinese spy balloon wasn’t?
what if they trace it back to Uranus?
The spy balloon was Chinese the rest are deacoys
This CNN reporting seems as reliable as listening to my mom and aunt argue about the "news" they read on Facebook and WhatsApp groups.
Please. Get technical. There are some of us out here who are not idiots and can understand what you are talking about.
It was from Zeta Reticuli.
Nice sweater
I'm more worried about all these religious freaks then a UFO. When they find out everything they have been told is a lie they are going to go crazy
Sounds like CIA is in charge of the news allowed and how to say it.
I'm not saying it's an alien,
BIO WEAPONS?
The story about what the Pilots spoke about is pure hearsay ----as any recording would be held tight to the waist...!
Posed a threat to civilian aircraft is a joke.  I'm not buying that reason.  They can block altitudes from aircraft.
They came from Mars.
I'm more afraid of our people that they are not transparent with us at all than the object by itself!!!
Where are the grown ups?
Could someone be planning an attack on USA  again,  trying to get views  over areas,  hope not,  hope my gut is wrong.
Another one shot down over Canada and Detroit?
Bob Lazar already told you all about this type of craft.
There are several potential advances in the realm of military applications for ion propulsion drones, including:  Long-Duration Surveillance: Ion propulsion drones can be designed for long-duration missions, making them ideal for surveillance and reconnaissance missions that require persistence over a large area. Orbital Capabilities: Ion propulsion drones can be used to perform missions in low-Earth orbit, such as satellite servicing, inspection, and repair. High-Altitude Flight: Ion propulsion drones can reach high altitudes, making them ideal for atmospheric research, weather monitoring, and other scientific missions. Stealth Capabilities: Ion propulsion drones can be designed with low acoustic and thermal signatures, making them harder to detect and track. This makes them useful for stealthy reconnaissance missions or as part of a stealthy strike package. Increased Payload Capacity: Ion propulsion drones can be designed with a high payload capacity, making them ideal for carrying sensors, weapons, or other payloads.
i think this is another country testing our defenses and response time. a real alien would have fire back or avoid getting shot down with no problem,
as much as I would like this to be aliens,  this is not aliens if this is even happening at all. think of it this way. do you guys really think that an advance civilization because they would have to be advance in order to reach our solar system and have the kind of tech the military says and we are going to be able to just shoot them down with a F16 and they are not going to fire back? cmon either is all BS of they re NOT aliens or they are aliens on vacation with no defense mechanism lol
It’s obviously classified by the military. Not “mysterious” what’s this? A movie.
If a Mile Wide ship starts showing up please do not shoot it down.
No visible propulsion? Could they have shot down the infamous TicTac UFO? Based on Commander David Fraver’s description of its ability to accelerate and maneuver tens of thousands of feet within seconds, it seems unlikely, however, many fighter pilots have reported sightings of unmanned craft with no visible propulsion that they encounter on a daily basis. None of the pilots would rule out the possibility of threat, but, none of them described them as one either. They just got used to them, like a weird doll at your gramma’s house- you’re pretty sure it’s comes to life while you’re asleep but since you never wake up bruised or scratched, you j begin to ignore the jittery feeling you push to the side
Ths is a joke.  A lot of this crazy stuff is put out by the US as test vehicles and intelligence gathering.  In the 60s they came out of Rockwell in W. NY   The AF scrambled planes out of Plattsburgh regularly.  I worked with a guy who had dispatched them   They never caught any even caught up to them when chased.  No explanation at the time what they were.  Rockwell had a secret research facility in W. NY>
Yall tryna distract from East Palestine OH being rained on by vinyl chloride
So, the reports are merely statements to say they don't know anything!? What are they? Whose are they? Why are they there? At least a dozen more questions, but not one actual answer! It's starting to look like the ufo fear mongering of the 50s and 60s all over again! Is this some kind of a precursor to getting into a war with China?!? Build up the fear level, pro ide a conveniently valid reason for going to war with another superpower?!? Too many questions, conspiracies, and mystery!!!
a bunch of lies again. emp? i agree with military people in that pilots would not speak out on classified info
Something very nefarious about all of this!!!
It would be just our luck if we get into a galactic space war because we thought we were shooting down Chinese balloons.
Alien probe
UFO
No balloon …. Maybe a UAP?
Where are their video recordings? That's what we need to see....
Inflation's up, balloons are down. CNN is still the Communist News Network. Don't trust the Fake News. Watch Newsmax,where the unbiased truth is shared.
Sorry I can't watch this guy.
Another Epstein diversion.
It's probably a weather balloon full of swamp gas
All of this is to keep people distracted
Your telling me that a jet was able to shoot down a UFO .. after all these years 🤔. What is really going on that the government is trying to hide?
I feel so dirty watching CNN
So here we go again,what is it this time Chinese, aliens....?!....so what instructions did CNN get from deep state....?!.... The Ukraine conflict is running it's course,and because people are not happy we need a new narrative to distract people from what we're doing in Ukraine.....if this is not the case can you please investigate the use of chemical weapons by Ukraine,they even made a f** video bragging about with a full fridge,it shouldn't be hard to look into it.....
👽👽👽
Still there is no aliens space proved facts, if alien ship it hard to target,it's a third class mental status of World War 2 orientation of Japan was sending bombs through Pacific presently copied by some other country.
Spend a million dollar shooting down a thousand dollar toy drone
In my opinion, the pilots should not be talking.  I cannot believe it is ok for them to be talking about it.
For anyone thinking these are some alien stuff or something crazy.  NO WAY.  I have zero belief that we could shoot down anything from a civilization that could travel between planets (let alone solar systems) easily enough to come here.  We're not that interesting.    That fight would be something akin to the combined current US forces working together (army, marines, air force, navy) having a battle with the roman legions.  That would be the best case scenario, likelier any attack from a civilization that advanced wouldn't even be recognized as an attack.  It would be a slaughter, a sad, sad slaughter.  This is something from close to home, and it scares me that we're ramping up toward something bigger.  To me this feels like someone testing the wire to see how far they can get, how long it takes to respond, what we respond with, etc etc.  You get a LOT of information about defenses from getting something shot down.
give some names if the pilots "spoke out"...... fake news
it's not ufo, it's homo sapiens, probably in the last stage of evolution, everything is coming together, there is a war, there is a threat of world war 3, they are afraid that in this way, people will destroy themselves, maybe someone will survive, and that's how it should be, since they exist, that means people will survive
We are able to see another planet shoot 4 of these, and no one knows what it is yet seriously there. Gona say a 15 year old made them and flew them
If and when an advanced alien civilization decides to attack us, there will be no warning. We will all just die. And that'll happen the moment we advance enough in technology to actually pose a threat to them. As you can see we're doing our absolute best to make sure that if and when we make official contact, it'll be a conflict. And by conflict I mean.. Imagine a fight between a 10yo boy with a bag of stones (that's us) vs a 10ft 300kilo giant mma fighter with bulletproof, invisible suit on that can fly faster than a fighter jet and shoot lasers from his asshole while drinking coffee, solving a crossword puzzle, texting your wife and destroying the world record of fruit ninja on 5 different devices at the same time while taking a shit, walking the dog and singing Bohemian Rhaphsody flawlessly and playing Beethoven's 13th piece Backwards, simultaniously. Oh and there's a thousand of them, and 1 of us. Imagine that.
"Eyewitness testimony is the worst form of evidence" - Niel deGrasse Tyson.
globalist propaganda🙃
Oh boy CNN left the comments open..nice..wait for it..wait for...boo killer ducks from outer space shot down! Reset phase 3 commences!
Ufo
There UFO's but that doesn't mean aliens
Aliens keeping an eye so Russia-US-China do not go nuclear, eh? ;). We may see there is suddenly a deescalation of hostilities — well, won’t be that bad if that’s a reality. We don’t know what’s really going on but the major players surely do.
If it was aliens, I wonder what kind of payback there would be?
They always know more that they share with the public.
These two other flying objects looks like a lie and a diversion from the Chinese balloons. Us failure to act faster .😁😁😁
Does anyone else think that copycats will be sending up their Amazon bought weather balloons just to watch the weak feckless Joenochio administration chase it's tail?
This provides great DeepState media cover for the Hunter Biden corruption scandal you refuse to cover objectively.
Nice Planet... We'll take it Humans..you have helped..in destroying it.  This can't happen. Hey Putin Hey Assad  Hey  🇺🇸  Looking at all of us.  All they would say is quit destroying the place.  You won't,so we will take humans off the planet.   let everything else live.   In... ✌   We can't stop ourselves. When the poles shift.. When Aliens let you know  nothing you have, that can match us.  Then you will wake up. Signed, 👽 life
Very poor propaganda this time, Covid was better...
Imagine aliens trying to see if we are nice people and sending visitors to check to meet us, but we shoot them instead, 😆🤣
A Russian boy comes to his father. He asks why in all the movies aliens attack America? Dad replies: you see, son, the aliens are kind and want to help us!
I smell BS!!!
This report is pure BS! Click bait
Do you really have faith in your government.?????
It's almost like eyewitness accounts are not dependable. If only we'd known that for the last 50 years.
funny how cnn doesnt report on the twitter and fbi collusion. The idiots will be distracted by balloons or whatever😳
It's God damn Aliens man  Were under attack. Game over man  Game over....
Well, it has been a pleasure living with you all. It was a great ride. Bye ✌️
Bs
How fast was it going?
I’m not sure what the truth is, but I’m 100% positive what they said in this video isn’t it. And now for the truth let’s bring in the CIA guy!
What's the hell Is going on???🤔🤔🤔
Is china we are just calling their balloons ufos to avoid backlash china prob getting ready for a follow up attack after covid attack
ROFLMAO NORAD can track Santa but can't spot a balloon in our airspace
If it was aliens they would be so much more advanced they wouldn’t get shit down
Why not show us videos
Once the US government releases their first findings it will be pure fiction, politics & propaganda. How can they say all 5 balloons were from China? (no evidence)
B.S
Communist News Network.  #Owned
Couldn’t find a single independent source that supported this claim. Sites that do parrot this claim all source it back to “Open Source Intelligence Monitor” which comes up blank on a google search. The claim of the pilots flying F35s also contradicts that of the military only mentioning F22s being part of the operation. All in all, this seems like misinformation.
"posed a threat to civilians" The oldest manipulation of governments of all time The go-to excuse to use lethal force against anything and everything I pray and hope people don't actually believe this massive BS This is just the regular response our governments resort to when confronted with ANYTHING they don't understand Bunch of Idiots in power dictating our relationships with each other and possibly aliens Our governments are putting us in DANGER instead of protecting us It's time we rise up against these violent organizations Seriously what it's gonna take for us to unite against these evil sociopaths?? There will be no inter galactic war! the moment we pose a threat to aliens - we are DONE.
So crazy republicans weren’t enough?  Now we have aliens in our skies.  What a S… Show this country is!
I saw armies of God almighty in the sky last light 😢 Oh my God , this is the prophecy of the second coming of our Lord Jesus . Are we prepared for rapture
How to get the human race to unite and subscribe to a one world government: an extinction level event or an alien visitation.  Looks like we're going for the latter 🤣
Why are we spreading all this fear and confusion? If it's a balloon it doesn't have a propulsion system... It's a balloon. It's not lizard people from the Andromeda Galaxy. Get a grip CNN.
Where’s is the proof enough talk
why do aliens only invade north america?
Beware of a fake alien invasion people. Our government adopted nazism after ww2.
Told you decades ago ufos are here
A balloon in the jetstream can move very quickly.. 300 mph is not unheard of.
If Joe Biden hadn’t took all that money from the Chinese government this probably wouldn’t be happening  Impeach Joe Biden now
If you can't quote or show anything, all you're saying is heresay. Shut up about your UFO nonsense
They don't know how it's being propelled? So it's a ufo... I wonder if it's alien... and we've been blaming the Chinese this whole time 😅
Oh no not FBI !?!? So basically itll be lost within the next month if it doesnt fit the narrative😂
This would change everything if this are aliens
China claims we sent ballons over to them so bunch he an she said saw u did it bs
How fast are they flying is it like tictac just tell us already
My theory is that the aliens have a crush on Natasha Bertrand. Can you blame them?
Jesus attempting the return for the 4th time already and deep state shoots his throne down. Everyone cool with that? The boss wants back in but we don’t want him because we got good business going on here without his performance review demands and all that annoying crap about the teachings and shit?
ITS ALIENS
Who knows it might be ET or you know making story up. I don’t know.
If you think these balloons are no big deal, I have three words for you:  "Electromagnetic Pulse Device."  A balloons such as the one they allowed to fly over our bases and missile silos for days could easily carry one of these devices.  The detonation of an EMP over our atmosphere has the potential to send the effected area back to the stone ages for years.  Our enemies are planning something, and they know now that while we have a dementia addled moron in the Whitehouse, it is the time to strike.  My spider senses are going off for days now... something is wrong.
They know it was unmanned, but can’t even describe it? Right!!
And it doesn’t need to obliterated with missiles! It’s small enough to be shot down without missiles.  I think they used missiles so it would destroy all evidence that proves it’s not a UFO
99 red balloons
I'm not saying it's aliens but... 👽
These objects will turn out to be mylar balloons and other such innocuous stuff.
Usa weather balloon
usa the new soviet
The reason Bob doesn't want to be technical is because he doesn't know anything technical! What is the BS about "frequency hopping"? Does the object use any frequency band for communication? Any digital modulation for the wireless transmission? It is fundamental that you have to use frequency hopping for digital wireless communication due to the possibility of Rayleigh Fading. If the object or balloon needs to send information over the north America it has to send upwards to a satellite in space, zero chance it will have Rayleigh Fading issue, you only have Rayleigh Fading issue in urban environment due to multiple reflections from different buildings. Once again, what was Bob talking about? Basically nothing, zero, nada!
Softening up Blinken?  Fat chance.
Why were they anymore dangerous to civilian aircraft than the China balloon?  Smh 🤦‍♀️  They let the China balloon go all through the country and said it wasn’t dangerous to civilian aircraft.  Whatever!  It’s just another hoax. A distraction to peoples minds off Hunters laptop and the new exposure of corruption through the Twitter files.  And whatever ride the dirty government is hiding.
They dont know this, they dont know that….but we the people do understand that military reports and the news correlate information into ongoing public confusion til the case is simply forgotten about
X Files territory ahead.  Where are Muller and Scully when we need them?
It's all BS the government is trying to put more fear into us to get more control.
Can one of you liberal idiots explain why, under Biden, we have had millions of chickens die, tens of thousands of cows die, and 96 food processing plants burn to the ground?  Can you explain why Biden has been fortifying the WH grounds with concrete barriers?  Can you explain why this Whitehouse and the Praetorian guard liberal press began calling them Chinese spy balloons but are now referring to them as "UFOS of unknown origin?" This administration is flooding the US with illegals, allowing spy balloons to gather data with impunity, and spending trillions on bullshit.  They are trying to crush this nation, and it's working.  When will you circus clowns start asking questions as though this country is your home too?
Disclosure is coming, like it or not. The question is are we talking ET or Indenpendence Day
Similar objects, should be near to it. Possibly simple Archimedes principles should behind it, with magnetic fields from North to South. Thanks.
If it has no propulsion than its a typical UAP. These objects are coming from here but from other dimensions.
Sounds like Merica trying to pre-justify an up and coming invasion they are planning.
I want to see photos of these flying cars.... Why only photos from the China balloon?
The pilots are not going to say what they saw to the public.
I would think they would have some idea of: trajectory and speed since they have 2 points of this last object. That would give them an idea where they lifted off from.  ALSO: I am not an expert but I think Belgium could answer some questions about how they are powered. I pictured hydrogen and shaped like a blimp. Using solar panels to create water vapor. I did pretty well in both science and history so guessing.
If we do have an encounter make sure we use the proper pronouns… We don’t want to offend aliens attacking us… Alien lives matter…🤮🤮🤮🤮
Any technology capable of traveling light years to our planet isn't going to get shot down by a fighter jet.  Have you seen the latest Chinese stealth drones?  They look like UFOs.
Someone or something is testing our reaction be careful now
If it was an extraterrestrial craft the public will never know it.  The truthfulness of government on this topic is less than trustworthy.
Just shut up.. show us or shut up
Effin' Chinese (?) clever as they always are but who knows what country (?) Could be Russia, Iran, North Korea or life on Mars (but that's a real long shot!) . All this tech we have worldwide and still can't figure out these "UFO's" (so to speak) or maybe it was some Russian resident who loves our Super Bowls here in the States and decided to create some of drone or what ever to watch the BIG GAME there, lol!
UFO!
This is probably a bunch of false flag stuff so they can martial law…
I am more afraid of this object being from our world than from another.
cnn fake corrupted news.all lies.
This planes have recording cameras, why the confusion? This is how all conspiracies are conceived.
Its a hight altitude balloon sealed, it was sent to America to confuse the radars, beware  maybe war will be coming sooner than America expected. Be careful of china & russia, maybe they got new technology the west never heard of
Can those pilots read "Made in China" which was clearly written on the ballon
These jets are full to the brim with electronic equipment but none of them apparently had a simple camera. We are getting the mushroom treatment. (Kept in the dark and fed BS.)
1:09 Wait what??  Pilot could not see no identifiable, propulsion system.. did not know how it was staying up in the air and maintaining the altitude it was. Is the pilot saying it wasn’t using a hot air balloon to keep it up in the air ???
I am worried that our actions may help predict what the intelligence of these objects want, as we shoot items before knowing what is inside.  Could it be that once our pattern is known, something could be stored in one of these objects that is poisonous to our air and we follow the pattern of blowing it up thereby dispersing what's inside, out in our air.  Hopefully we can analyze what is inside these objects without having to destroy them first.
They're weeding out the globophobiacs first!😃
Your Govt is playing dumb, they know damn well what these things are, just not gonna come out and tell you the real story.
A UFO?
Google earth photos...where are our young IT expert s
How come there is no footage of the last 3 objects? There was a lot of footage including it being shot down of the first one.
UFOs or could they be from another planet?
Mythomaniac CNN freak show… STFU!
Af
FALSE FLAG CHINA WAR PREP!!!
A telescope can see a flys wings on the 🌙. Yet Americans can't see what's at 40,000 feet.   Total BS and reported as real news
How does heatseeking missile shoot down balloons? Those are helium balloons, not hot air balloons.
year ago they publicly showed videos of UFOs and now this ? strange timing
Sum Ting Wong and Wi Tu Low called in and shared that pilot info with CNN
More fake news
The first balloon did not hover over the WH and Pentagon because there is no intelligence there.
😅🤣😂what bs sounds like a long tall tale
Honestly think they shot E.T. Out the sky while he was traveling to the moon.
Even if Biden in the rada says in plain text that Ukrainians are stupid cannon fodder, and the Americans use them, they won't give a shit. They are highly developed in Gene Lebell. ahahahah  The most psychopathic, narcissistic nation is the Americans. Stupid Yankees)))) ahahahah  The losses of Ukrainians amounted to about 600,000 people - was Russia defeated? ahahahahaha.
its not a alien craft/i no the crafts/it is impossible to shoot them down/no technoligy/in our world could touch them/as there a milion years advanced from us humans...
and the final card,, fake alien invasion
First shots of the war with ET have been fired
China: they finally start looking at the sky
Well buckle up people and get ready for the fallout from this.
I do not believe we have ever engaged a UFO by firing on it before. We observed them but I believe to date have never attempted to shoot one down. So is this a first?? That Tic Tac that was spotted by various pilots off the USS NIMITZ performed unlike anything they had ever seen before.  Everything gets explained away as being something that people can understand and something that does not threaten the status quo.  It would be interesting if it were indeed SOMETHING ELSE and all of a sudden the human species was put on notice
they cannot shoot down the aliens technology except china technology
I hope they said Gotcha Bastards !
Starting war with aliens out of paranoia ,US Flys over other countries all the  time and sand drones, make war threats if shot down
She?
We didn't know what we shot down sounds logical to me stop drinking the Kool-Aid America.
I cannot wait to see what the Qanon crowd comes up with!
What amazes me about this is that CNN actually reported on a news worthy item without blaming it on Trump, or even mentioning him one time. Now that's newsworthy by itself.
WHATEVER HAPPENS, I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER THAT JOE BIDEN IS IN CHARGE!! NOT!!!!!
chinnese spy baloon ??? lol 😂 😂 its a title now ? this is the kick of dying horse . rae dolio has told you that america is dying nation but you dont wna listen . read history , right before a superpower dies it becomes very paranoid and chases the wind . youre accusing china and yet china is busy winning lol
I don't want to freak people out...I could be very wrong, however, I suspect these baloon type devices carry airborne illnesses or practicing to carry them in an effort to deploy germ warfare. Our proposed enemies know that a traditional military war would be a losing proposition. But, germ warfare, i.e., spreading a deadly disease over our air space...well you get it. I think they're practicing deploying just such a preventative attack, if we're sick or dead there's no war. IMO, now I may be very wrong and hope I am.
The shooting down of Chinese spy balloons is a great idea...  The shooting down of EXTRATERRESTRIAL objects belonging to a race that has the capabilities of vaporizing us with the snap of a finger...  NOT SO MUCH!
I dated the son of a fighter pilot many years ago (the son later joined the military and flew attack helicopters) and he said his father never discussed missions, or the result of sorties even though it was toward the end of the cold war where encounters with Migs was commonplace. I believe that US Pilots are far too honorable to leak information if it could adversely affect the US and the security of the US. It's base scuttlebutt and that is why it is so vague. I am more concerned about the fact that the examination of the first UFO showed that it had a mix of Chinese and US technology. As they are aligning themselves with Russia I think it is beyond time that we cut that pipeline but perhaps it is too late.
CNN at it again. Lol
This is nothing more than a distraction. Ignore this stupid shitzen. We're losing the war in Ukraine, but we can shoot down balloons and unidentified objects.
I will like to say, that if it was a UFO we are in trouble, as shouting down will more to come. Get prepared people for something is coming.
Xi is just flying kites which are not flat but spheres.
The Xfiles
This is so much more than you think they have not updated our defense of our country from the 70 and 60 our own ICBM are so out dated  This is a show to up get more money out of defense to update without thanking from the other project on going. They won’t  you to feel scared so you will agree with them taking more money for military industrial complex
At this point I think it's safe to say we have no idea if these more recent objects are even terrestrial in origin.  What the pilots are describing are the same things that pilots from the F/A 18 USS Nimitz strike force described after the Pentagon released the 2004 video taken from the Surper Hornets' POD displays.  They said they could not identify a means of propulsion or heat signature.  They looked like tic tacs the size of a car... and sometimes they would just hover over the ocean and move out of the way when a jet would fly through... and like seagulls, they'd move out of the way and then return to their previous formation... but other times the crafts would fly from 60,000 ft to sea level in less than a second.  They were able to lock on with their POD system, but they weren't given permission to engage.  It's sounds like these are the exact same crafts, but with them at commercials aircraft altitude, they presented a safety hazard.... but I think they were mainly pushed to engage because of the China balloon incident a week earlier off the eastern seaboard.  Meaning they were at high alert for enemy aircraft.   But I think its beginning to sound as though these last 3 vehicles had nothing to do with the China balloons, and weren't balloons at all.  In fact, a report just came out by Russia saying they shot one of these objects down last month... and China just 5 hours ago said it engaged and attempted to shoot one down.  These are NOT balloons.  They may be some highly technical drones from a private company or even foreign adversary... but with the previous declassified videos from the Pentagon 3 years ago, combined with the pilot descriptions, we have to consider these might also be something of non-terrestrial origin.
Distractions
Blah blah blah. Just hide the truth.
George Santos saved our world from liberal  👽
They killed Kenny!   You bastards!
Being raised in the military, I do not believe the pilots would even speak out on this classified mission.
Can these Pilots define a Woman? If not, it explains why the can’t determine what they saw. The aircraft don’t have cameras? More chops b.s..
Haven’t these jets got dashcams?😂
ALIENS 👽
six minutes of people talking saying they don't know anything.  thanks CNN
Unidentified object. Was it flying?? Then UFO. If it was an advanced tech thing then surely it would be able to stand a rocket. Also HUGE difference between a ballon and a strapped on antenna and this.
That was my love letter!  Now, she will never read it.  lol
Do anyone believe that launching a missile to shootdown baloons claimed to be carrying "Chinese spy equipments" is a coherent story? Good for you.
ufo
Cnn always lied about trump what makes you think they aren't lying about these pilots speaking out about this classified mission
Agree with Annie in KC
Love to see us shoot down Russias and chinas ufo’s. ❤️❤️. America doing its thing! 😁
"Mysterious" object ... that WE sent up to shoot down all for show because we F'ed up last week.  I don't believe anything coming out DC anymore.
Bravo! CNN taking on Netflix in sci-fi fictions
UFO 😂
CNN you really think the American people are that dumb.  For many years people have claimed to see lights in the sky and you all called them weather balloons and now their are spy balloons from other countries and you now say they are not ruling out aliens. Come on stop with the lies. We are headed for war so stop with the bs. If trump was in office this wouldn’t be happening no matter what you weak democrats say. Love him or hate him no country would be stupid enough to mess with him bc we know he’s will do whatever it takes to protect the country.
Don't you guys at CNN know what NORAD is? It's not Norway, as you've written it!!... As Xi is the leader of China, not "she"!!! C'mon guys, CNN has some responsability in informational journalism the entire world over!...
“The next thing they will stream to the masses, is an extra-terrestrial war made by man to fear space”
So it is not a news report, it is just blatant gossip no better than you would get from the nosey old curtain twitching bag across the garden fence.
Sounds lile they have Mulder and Scully om the case.
Please don't tell me that we are shooting down UFOs
An UFO has been shot down. Welcome to the war of the worlds.
I call bullshit! As a former military pilot myself I wouldn’t have said anything to the media.
When the Greek philosopher Aristotle first suggested the world was round, skeptics dismissed it as fantasy... When Copernicus theorized the sun, not the earth, was the center of our solar system...many considered it heresy...When Jules Verne wrote a human being would someday travel to the moon, science rejected it as pure fiction... Perhaps UAPs and alien encounters will have its day as well
They are here!
It is not inconceivable to believe that we are not the only lifeforms in the universe. I find this extremely fascinating.
plotting something behind the scenes and using this tactic to distract us. 🤔
Here is a video from a guy in Prudhoe Bay of the ongoing search, detection and recovery efforts of the high altitude objects. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIvZ5u3WIoI
Might have been some aliens. We might be attacked by aliens. How can you shoot down something you don't look now what it is
Could be Santa's new carriage  ...
They want answers like it just didn’t happen the other day it take time to analyze and recover it for the FBI to determine what it is. Please have some pieces it don’t happen overnight.
Great now this is the latest trend and all the rage all over media.. WHAT WILL THE US SHOOT DOWN NEXT... OH STFU ALREADY! It's sad when a country can be so stupid to fall for all the bullshit. The object takes DAYS to identify in an age where information travels at the speed of light so they can paint the scene in our favor. Wake up people. Its embarrassing how obvious this nonsense is.
I've been a youtube commenter for 99 years so trust me. It is a flying object from another dimension.
What about the balloon above South America. Nobody talks about it anymore…
So all of them are Chinese now?!? I thought they were still investigating??!!
I took a pic last night of a stream of bright light dots in the sky moving in a line very fast. I'm so glad I took a pic of it I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it
Come April 2023. Just disclose we are not in the Universe alone. It all leads to one thing. James Webb Telescope, UFO being spotted and acceptnce by US Government. It all comes together
Weather balloon 🎈
Get Agent Mulder & Scully on this
So... what did the pilots say?
They're setting us up for a fake alien attack you can't believe anything they say on the media they are all a bunch of liars all this is planned
GAYBOY Don Lemon is a CHAUVINIST ‼️BOYCOTT the morning show ‼️It's working ratings are a all time low in MSM ‼️
How can you know what speed it was traveling at but can not determine what direction it was traveling in???
Avengers Assemble!
"Its very difficult to see its no wonder they saw different things" sprry sir but have you flown an f35? And somehow know how hard it is to make stuff out in them? I think you're full of bullshit old mam
Biden must be trying to deflect the Epstein files or the hunter biden laptop it’s funny. We watched the Chinese balloon for two weeks before the clown know about it now all of a sudden we’re shooting down all kind of stuff supposedly the timing is immaculate.
So Tired Of All This Slickster Talk..
They couldn't say what they saw because there was nothing to see. This is a cover up by the government to prevent the people finding out about the train wreck that released dangerous toxic gasses into the air.
Are y’all playing up this story to get peoples’ attentions from the chemicals in Ohio?
Lies
It's probably some kid's science project.
Yeah... i dont believe any of this. This mission would of been classified. Guaranteed no pilots were talking about their flight lol. CNN is so dumb!
Interesting, when we upgrade our radar these things start appearing or maybe they were there all along.
It was a amazon drone delivering another pallet of vodka to Nancy pelosi
SO, maybe the Chinese WANT us to shoot us down. They sent the balloon to gather radio comms to/from the fighter, the fighter's radar frequencies signature, and other info to allow them to combat the fighter in the future...
Its probably coming down to investigate whats going on in our planet war ,earthquakes , floods massive loss of human life which most could be prevented  in our world do we really need to kill and destroy everything we see
It is all distraction! Cartoon Network? Lies and distraction
Military killed their own people are just so they can go to war with someone else that's what they do manipulate the  population
That’s how COVID got here?
They were alien visitors coming to save humanity. Oh well, we had our chance. 👽👉
Biden’s handlers preparing the nation for more lockdowns.
People need realize what's going on notice how everything is a threat so kill everything these people need a wake-up
Wonder what payload these craft can carry. Biochem would be a viable delivery
Why are we shooting down things if we don't know what they are?  Are we that stupid?
It's ridiculous everything is a threat to these people they think they own the air we breathe
More distractions with this Government and now China blaming US flying balloons over its airspace. Here the Media is making up a story to keep us all focused on a mysterious object while our Country goes to S#it🤔
I was almost afraid that China wouldn't get blamed of the unidentified objects. But it happened in the final few seconds phew that was a sweat!
I mean this. I hope its advanced life from space that's come to save the planet from humanity 🙏.  Why do we have wars ? Why do others want to destroy each other because rhet believe in a different religion? Why do we fight over land that belongs to the earth not us humans ?. I'm no religious person but I believe in a creator.
Please stop saying China this China that. First figure out from where this kraft comes from. Stop wasting our time
Why are we already assuming this object is from China already? Sounds like the media already making baseless assumptions again
“Dramatic”. “People freaking out.” Come on with these headlines. Sounds ridiculous. People are going about their day to day life not freaking out. Watch the fear mongering headlines. Lol
Alien
Sounds like MSM bullshit to me..
The news has been staged for quite some time.  Only ask certain questions.
"We come in peace"..  F22 pilot: "FOX TWO!"
The propulsion system of a balloon is the wind. Not visable. My bullshit-radar is going bezetk now. Betcha that all the Covid believers will accept it when government tells us the aliens are attacking. Making free more money for bullshit.
There area a lot of possibilities here- none of them are good... just sayin'.
Nobody ever seems to see a damn thing, even if whatever it was schlapped them on the Arze.
This is Not name that Tune. Anything which enters USA or Canada Nationals waters unauthorized it gets shot down. You are at best guessing at what it is, you do not know. Shut Up until you get facts.....
"Pentagon testing mass surveillance balloons across the US" - August 2019
UFO
I understand the need for secret info gathering right now, but WE do want the real,  whole story  eventually., and not 10 years later in a book. Is our government protecting us?
foo fighters....there here again !!
They obviously have a propulsion system, just not a powerful system. Slow moving, light skinned and filled with helium. It was an exaggerated toy intended to do what it did, test our response and discussion. The bigger puzzle is why, as the manufacturing center of the World and largest supplier of goods, would China conclude it's not enough to become powerful through trade and cooperation. That they must become the World's largest intimidator military power. What's to be gained through a war for domination when they became a large wealthy economy through trade.
Wow!  project  bluebeam in full force....so covid, global war, and the greenhouse effect didn't work in controlling and culling the public and stealing  their money....so maybe this will work!
Clearly these objects with no wings or visible means of propulsion are just toy balloons full of swamp gas & powered by bullshit.
If we had a president that did his darn job we would not have this happening , under trump they would never do this , they will confuse us and then come in Thu the South
It says the object changes frequencies when it's signals are being surveiled if I heard that right?
Only reason why they showed us the balloon is because the public already had footage of it. Civilians took videos and photos of it. The one in Canada, and the one in Alaska they aren’t showing nothing, nor even describing anything. Why cover a story when there’s nothing to cover?
what speed? is there a radar track?
this is bigger then everyone thinks and I feel like some very interesting and maybe even scary things are about to come to light ..slowly but surely disclosure is happening and in a way its by force these objects whatever they are ,are becoming more bold and the govmnt.is running outta things to say
was there no other way of bringing down the baloon safely without shooting it so that they may study it?
They are testing us to get in
It's still Chinese spy object it's good they shot it down
What's weird is how does it stay at these heights and how does it have control
It's time for the slow unravel .............👽😉
UFOs before: "now you see me, now you don't! I can shoot down complete military installations. I will probe your ass and you won't ever catch me in your ...ing life!" UFOs now: "three guys shut down this week..."
Seems with all the puffing and protesting coming from China there is little doubt their origin is China, not Martians.
I caught one on video and high quality detailed pictures of these things! Completely silent,from still to a huge greenish field appearing around it and it took off from high atmosphere to 200’ feet flying so fast the field appeared lit by fire! If anyone from the government want my videos and pictures all in HD crystal clear i will help! IG has compressed the video but you can still see it’s completely silent ,faster than anything your mind can imagine! No disturbance whatsoever,no wing ,no sound,no cracking the sound barrier! Check fir yourselves,but know the original is longer and twice the width showing many more frames of the object in HD quality! They were all over the sky!
I know they shot down e.t.
bollox
Smells like China to me
The no: 4 was the alien craft, so was classified.
If it was another china weather balloon I think they would of said this sounds like a different china craft or a genuine ufo or uap something not adding up
She's giggling. Bob the Bear ? They're all laughing. They sound novice and insincere. This is a joke. Listen closely even the dialogue is unsure. Possibly deep fake.
Aliens
So you destroy a UFO with no idea what it is or who is in it? surely a civilised society would have just accompanied this so called UFO to see where it would go, did he say once an object was traveling at Mac 6?
STOP STOP STOP funding china all cheap goods and cars
Acosta Marxist lies
My guess is it was a private plane
It's Trump's classified documents that Putin is sending back to him. Putin found no use for them.  Lmao
They keep making it worse intentionally, f-35 / f-22 and even f-16 can tell what it was made of by the temperature it radiates. If it wasn't a balloon and it was made by any short of metal plus being able to stay up there things aren't good -
XENOS
Hmm!!! From the news it's clear it's not balloon when it was  it was stated and video .now this thing is definitely UAP but not a ship possibly a drone sent from somewhere out of this world .again it could be CIA plans to escalate the tensions between Americans and Chinese.
Koje anericke lazi to je customers zastrasivanje svoga naroda ameri su najvece zlo na svijetu ali uskoro nece biti svjet ce da se oslobodi demona
We just made the aliens angry
unidentified huh?    no photos of the wreckage (object ) to post huh?        Such liars..   they cant be totally honest with us to save there own lives.     maybe if the object was driven by people of color,  theyd already have pics, blood types, and ancestory info. of this myserious sighting.   😵😵😕
China is testing the time for their ICBM from 1st time entering West until get caught by West...the longer is better for china ICBM to maneuver so they can hit any target freely...CRITICAL and be cautious! It's time now to protect our sovereignty and don't let any enemy intimidate us💪
BRO WE NOT STUPID got to be aliens
lol you as is a joke
Love wesson media, talk and talk,have opinions are say nothing. It's a mystery to me how you all can put up with it, this constant barrage of nothing  !
Track it back to China - Russia - I don't know. So why say so you clown? Surely those F35's have film & photographic evidence of this vehicle as it traveled through the atmosphere. This is deranged so-called reporting.
BS MSM distraction
Now there are "Astroids" falling into the english channel... I hope its aliens that underestimated us (the fight face first 🤣).
Its aliens!
?*false flag, real 'open' but not open about actual details....... But somehow sounds familiar, like how that one military guy explained on his deathbed what the government would attempt to do the next 40/50 years... Called out the 9/11, Patriot act,middle east conflict, and so on, leading to a giant false flag' alien' event meant to steal what remaining autonomy citizens have left........ Just a thought, no I don't remember who it was
theres no such thing as aliens..get a grip 🙄
It’s man made, if it was of alien nature it wouldn’t of been shot down , and gone in instant.
Lies
Who cares
False flag alien threats incoming.. no worries, the government will take care of us. As long as we obey right... My god this is just comical.
CCP was just looking for some relief from recent barrage of criticism over their response to Covid - 19. This is a godsend for them. Xi is probably the happiest to claim these UAP originated in China.
History Channel: it's the Aliens Hahaha
Its all a self created situation people dont be decieved its man made
I hope the USA is not trying to start a war with aliens, they might have better technology than us.
That's it for today kids, and to review today's letters "U" "A" and "V" and also our lesson on cylindrical, spherical and octagonal forms were brought (down) to you by the Department of Homeland Security.
I have absolutely NO idea what anyone is saying here.
Perhaps MIRRACLES, hahahahaha.
Bru just say Aliens! Tf
UFO is exactly that. Simple.  Plenty more where these ones came from.
If CNN is reporting on it, you can be sure it's propaganda.
Project blue beam incoming
Next they will say   "Well we don't know where it was from or what it was because it's all blown up now".
Was it green lantern ship?.......
The aliens 👽 are coming
Anyone else fall in love with that lady from the way she looked down the camera?
Americans: first shoot and then examine more closely.
It's not out of the ordinary for two pilots' MISREPS to not agree.   "This is starting to sound like something out of the X-Files.."  Y'all are being ridiculous.
Very scary ! US F-22 fighter jet is balloon 🎈 killer 😂
THERE ARE TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS FROM BIDEN'S 40+YEARS OF WORTHLESS GOVERNMORE OFFICE ON THOSE. THE CHINESE NEEDED A DIVERSION FROM THOSE FOUND IN THE VARIOUS BIDEN OFFICES AND HOMES.
Bullshit,pilots didn't say shit,CNN makes stories as usual,lies
Cue all the potheads saying it's alien 👽 😅
Thank you China, US can call it TARGET PRATICE for the Air Force.  Great job US Air Force.
ALL PEOPLE WITH ANY SENSES, KNOW THIS IS FAKE NEWS. NOT HAPPEN. THE DEEP STATE/BLACK HATS IS CREATING THIS NEWS. FAKE, FAKE, FAKE.
China also been pissed off because of this, so maybe this is a China Drone..
It's a ancient Chinese secret
Aliens
We don't know what it is,  blow it up⁉️⁉️
To promote fake news, CNN interviewed non technical people
🤣🤣🤣
If it's Russia, then of course it makes perfect sense that it was before Blinken's visit. Right?
Biden is a embarrassment and so is @cnn you all are a total joke everyone all over the world see America as weak country cnn tell lies to America people every single hour
No sense to u? U don't know who sent?  Thats what they r doing from decades against other countries.......  Now it's on u....
It drifts on the wind. As ballon’s do.
Hey, I call BS! Since when do military pilots tell us anything?  Why would they tell us anything? If it’s other worldly they wouldn’t have shot it down.
There's more than one reason for the prime directive, namely, not getting shot down by the indigies.
i see one  OVNI   in france   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHJMzy0s0V4
China is our enemy.  Americans need to buy products as few as they can that are made in china.
What if it's not from China or Russia?
For centuries, people have reported sightings of strange flying objects in the sky. One of the earliest recorded instances occurred in 1878, when a farmer in the United States claimed to have seen a large, dark, circular object resembling a balloon moving at incredible speed. This led to a wave of similar reports of "mystery airships" in various parts of the country over the next two decades, causing some people to fear that renowned inventor Thomas Edison had created an artificial flying star. More recently, reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the USA and Canada have been linked to the proliferation of Chinese balloons. This highlights the ongoing human tendency to misinterpret and speculate about aerial phenomena, as well as the persistence of UFO sightings and beliefs.
The aliens already came and went after confirming that no intelligent life existed on Earth.
What the last guy said tops everything.
the Administration & military are making it up, after the balloon incident... just prolonging fear... prob a civilian (or several) is playing with the US hysteria... Definitely, your being lied to, or some ppl are playing  pranks. Or, maybe its pieces of satellite, falling back into atmosphere...?
They know everything it is aliens and they're hiding the truth
Think about that. military aircraft are flying over our heads from other countries.
Stop all commerce with Chi Na and watch how fast the answers start coming. BOYCOTT anything from Chi Na

i think theyre keeping it unidentified for a reason, so that china doesnt have a reason to publicly lash out
They won't tell us because they don't want to look like ass hats as our enemies keep sending military aircraft in our air space. But hey I'm sure it's all in good fun. Chinese fun. This is what happens with a weak president and administration. Our adversaries are emboldened.
You telling me they didn't get a video of it before they shot it down. Bull. No more talking about classified documents, mission accomplished.
Basically that's propaganda at its best....
They shot UFO,period😅
You guys are all funny FBI huh it's supposed to be the military they take care of all the UFOs and nobody knows what it is you guys are funny
"Not even the pilots know" Yeah, no one is going to believe that. If they confuse the accounts, they can seem like they are being forthcoming, yet still not give any information.
Jim is such a puke
It’s the sphere within a cube that Ryan Graves saw. No visible propulsion mechanism visible but able to hover absolutely still even against the wing
Knowing this administration it's all just a smoke screen so people are talking about this and not bidens malarkey
Ex CIA expert: just so many questions like..uh..you know that..and uh...the thing with...just so many questions. CNN host: are you going to say those questions?
They are not UFO’s… CNN sucks
To Serve Man..
Iran sailing to south america, balloons magically appearing.... LOL
Technically... Any other worldly alien craft would be unmanned.  But not necessarily un-piloted. Wink
Russian without any doubt. To distract attention from Ukraine war.
The aliens are coming to save us from gas stove
did they not make any photos before shooting it. it's all a cover-up again sorry to say and why are you blaming china again it was very clear it's not a balloon. it was a size of a car   cars don't fly not at 40.000 feet 🤣😂🤣 maybe a new Tesla
They are talking about the pilot’s recollection but barley even describe what they seen
LOL.. "Security specialist" doesn't know the first thing about China.
Now they came to delete us all.😅
These objects were probably launched by the US Airforce and shot down so that they could influence the US government to continue to fund the US Airforce.
Project Bluebeam Get the Chinese out of our agencies.... military must eliminate all the embedded terrorists Chinese from our USA..  get that police station out of NYC... STOP FOOLING AROUND
Fake Cnn
UFOs, Aliens and balloons --- but nothing about eh USA blowing up Nord Stream 2 ...
Fake cnn
Humans are just weird. See something they don’t understand first option, shoot it down. This is why aliens never visit us😂
A GREAT MYSTERY, OH YEAH, CNN.
China and Russia is very dangerous for this World.
LOOK DUMB PEOPLE ! hoaxers and trolls have jumped on the bandwagon ! PLUS the defence establishment have got new technology to track these objects. This always happens.  I will literally eat my own shit in public if this is aliens . ITS NOT,I AM 100% sure
Another Roswell cover up
How are these conflicting statements?! That's like saying 2 guys in a bar fight made conflicting statements because one said he got punched and the other said he didn't get punched. 🤦 Stupidity of the media...
Here we go!!! Covid wasnt able to scare people into submission so now I advise everyone to educate themselves and brace yourself for a fake alien invasion. #projectbluebeam
FBI...PHEEWWWWWEE ..LYING SOS.
Finally UFO!
10% FOR THE BIG GUY CHINA 🇨🇳 JOE
NEVER SAY HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP FROM HELL ON C-SPAN WASHINGTON SWAMP JOURNAL 😉
C-SPAN SWAMP PROTECTING CHINA 🇨🇳 JOE AND HUNTER
Don't let the media steer you off course!
LITTLE JIMMY CCP CHINA PUPPET
It was another traitor Trump baby balloon 🎈 🤣
CNN CHINESE NEWS NETWORK CCP
Massive distraction attempt by news outlets and governments to change the financial system and get into blockchain based control
It's extraterrestrial, and we are unknowingly picking a fight with a far more superior civilization from another galaxy. Is this the beginning of the end of human civilization is my question.
It was an alien spaceship and will be taken to Area 51 to add to the collection 😂. Agent Mulder is in charge.
No one is confirming if it was moving or drifting. Just a  lot of implication art
Was going to believe, but then I realize is Jim Acosta. So these are all lies.
Do the same to China.
FBI taking the lead... So it was political technology.
I could not ever imagine that so many idiots have been gathered in CIA. They cannot even understand how a balloon in staying in the air without propulsion. God help us.
‘Pissing off aliens’ was number 12 on my bingo card.
Why are the pilots talking, hard to believe.
We wanted Biden, we got the baggage
Aliens: oh shit they succeeded with nuclear fusion. Send in the weird shapes!
flog a   "deadhorse"...............
Let’s see the wreckage and the pictures from pilots!
Big floating bags of virus/mold spore just waiting to be broke open! Just watch for the start of a new pandemic!
Pilots use sensors and cameras not their eyes.
UFO
Cost of balloon...maybe several thousand bucks. Cost of American missile...several hundred thousand bucks.
Aliens
It was an UFO.
Let's see the countries near by are Russia and China and even North Korea.  These may be a great distraction but worth looking at.
Confirmed: They shot down Mary Poppins. Umbrella identified from historical film footage. That's why they won't show the photos and why the pilots were giving different accounts. Just a spoonful of sugar.............
When she meant the FBI she actually meant Mulder and Skully
Communist news network 😂
Prolly Elon Musk and his Tom foolery.
DIVINE 💥🌅💥💥 HEALING 🤍🕊🤍😇🤍🤍 🌟🌈🌟✨️🌟🌟 EVENT 🎇🎆🎇 IS COMING 😘🥰😍
mulder and scully?
SO, what are we saying JIM? It was a FLYING SAUCER? These people don't need any REAL STORIES, they will make up their own. I personally think the ONLY REASON why the Ballon was allowed to basically transverse most of the US, is because China was paying Biden " BY THE MILE".
🤍🤍🤍 DISCLOSURE 🌌 IS COMING 🌟🛸🌟✨️🌟 ASCENSION 💥🌈💥💥 IS HAPPENING 💝 2023
Roswell 2.
Aliens
North Korean intercontinental missiles testing the US defence capability?  Is US saving face
So “thug-inc” will tell us what happened and what it is....what an amazing distraction 👌
And we wonder why we can't make contact. " Shoot when you see the whites of their eye's":)
remember the gimble tic tac sighting. But this time they realy fu...ed up  . Its one thing to recover these crashed craft. But to actualy destroy one... and recover its techknowledgy WOW
Send in the Men in Black 😂
So nobody recorded any video? Everybody has a cell phone now and our f 35 has no cameras? How come they are not releasing the pics? This is making it more suspicious
If it's something from another planet, the government will keep it secret.
It's not a ufo. Nothing to see here! These old men keep on blaming other countries and that's how wars get started but no one has the balls to say it's extraterrestria? Ignorance!
CRAP NEWS NETWORK
The only way that this could be aliens, is that these aliens made a grave mistake or folly of some sort that somehow decapitated their situational awareness. Other then that, it's highly unlikely. If they have FTL technology, they could detect a pin head in Kentucky from the moon. (hyperbole, yes, but you get what l mean.) So, I really, really, really, doubt that it's aliens. But not impossible....
The regime in charge !
You people just loves war. Everyone can see it. God usually gives the desire of the heart.
Tell us about the real story. NordStream.
😂I like the way US government playing tricks with US population explaining that US is the most democratic country in the Universe and US must protect democracy all over the Globe (Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Vietnam, Korea, Panama, Serbia, Ukraine…). But failed to discover any footages or facts of UFO. Or it’s so shameful to confess that other non democratic country just sent hello to Biden this way😂
Is it possible that these pilots saw a UFO...... Ancient Aliens astronaut theorist say YES!
The visitors are not going to be happy about this.
We should send a drone to intercept them and land them to get intelligence to better assess where and why they are coming on the international boarders to get the clue of where they are coming from
Never second guess China; they're the oldest civilization hence the most experienced hence the smartest. Remember the U.S. Anti-Chinese Act of 1880s, deporting 90% Chinese workers? American workers hated them because they were better (at everything).
Now we know it’s not our UFO,  because we shot it down. It’s not that scary If we can take it down with F35
cylindrical objects have been spotted by civilians for quite some time. but who would pay attention to civilians??
Spin
It’s ridiculous.  If you want rumors, omitting facts and data, unexplained events hyperbolized and you’ve got a recipe for another Conspiracy on Steroids with conspiracy theorist getting goofy, and This is how to do it.    A Balloon with a satellite caught on video.    What else exactly?  Facts Facts VIDEOS with up close footage. We’ve got satellite imagery / technology to do that.  Otherwise, forget about it.
CHINA HAS SATELLITES WHY DO THEY NEED BALLOONS
I think there is no much news in America these days. Who shoots down something they can't show surely?
Why do I feel like this a deflective tactic for something
Alisns
CNN GET YOUR PLANES RIGHT IT WAS AN F22 EACH TIME THAT SHOT DOWN THES UFO'S NOT F35'S
The baloon had a virus that will kill us all
Balloons with transponders don’t have propulsion systems and may interfere with jet electronics.
the problem is, the chinese are watching american tv news and and media news are asking too much questions that chinese military will know what the US found out,and the defense deparment ,never are gonna say ,what the US is going to do
Martians covering up for our idiot president.  The Gestapo, fbi, is just part of the coverup for a tyrannical government.  The fbi is colluding with the Martians.
Pilots reporting the object flying over Alaska is "interfering with the planes sensors" and not being able to identify a propulsion system really worries me. Maybe we shouldn't be so quick to shoot theses things down if we don't know what they are or where they came from.
How convenient
So, all of a sudden, the media: the kings and queens of speculation now has nothing to add to what they already know? lol
Maybe we'll get lucky and Putin will take over Washington then Americans will finally get quaranteed healthcare for all. Congress has failed Americans.
Loving all this weird shit starting to feel like im actually on a strange planet now what a time to be alive
Hopefully they are more accurate about this than Hunters laptop
It's Lissard people.
Tick tack we are getting in serious change in our world
Baba Vanga in her prediction said that In year 2023 .. Earth will have alien visitor. This could be possibility now
Holy shit. either these are alarmingly advanced reconnaissance craft from China or possibly other nations or it's a craft from a non-terrestrial source. It's of course very peculiar and relevant this is taking place immediately after the China balloon.  Maybe China is tracking these anomalies and that is what the true purpose of the balloons is. If so, that would make sense as a satellite would have a tougher time gathering data on something like this vs a collection of balloons, which spread over a search grid could better triangulate a target.  Very strange and concerning.
We only found out about the Chinese balloons because of a concerned citizen in Montana? The Biden administration was either clueless or allowing these overflights. Democrats are pathetic.
Cylinder or cigar shaped 🤔. Press conference asap
No vids released in J6 citizens event and nothing on CANADIA shoot down per Press Secretary Stupidity of Biden Regime beyond anything imagined
I guess they can test the material of the different 'balloons' to see what and how it was made. Hopefully they will find the ' made in China ' tag on them.
It was another baby super man from krypton, in 18 years we will see the consequences!
The Chinese do not look at the world the way we do. They look at their past and want to hold the world accountable for all the wrongs that have been done to them since the beginning of China. Some are very real and some are trumped up for political reasons but this is what they see and hear on a daily basis. They look at our involvement in Taiwan and Asia in general as if we are committing a foul which now entitles them to revenge and or what ever they think is warranted. The Chinese military does not have a strong civilian level of control over it as so many nations in the world do and they are looking for a fight to prove themselves. Think of it as if they are still in high school  and want to get into a fight just to prove they can do it. This fight will include so many people who will lose their life's and we could see the use of nukes. Loosing will not be an option for the Chinese and they will take it to that level to prevent a loss just as Putin may do as well. I can tell you that all wars are crimes and that's true. Wars happen frequently both big & small and all around the world are armies that are trained, armed and taught to kill. It's a when not an if at this point as to a military conflict between the U.S and China. Winne the pooh (Xi Jinping) himself has stated Taiwan by 2027 even if force is needed so it's already on the calendar folks !
These two Dummasses. And then trying to pin China as a cover up. The general public media in America is beyond words. I’m going to say it once “the public doesn’t care, we’re just sick of being lied to” I thought we were a team, a human team!
Too bad can't believe anything CNN says...especially this creep reporter...fjb! Go Trump!!
Sounds like ET has joined the chat.
World War III doesn’t have to be with guns and armor they could be putting in that big balloon fitting off and dropping on big cities and take them out that way so they better think twice about hitting that cause that could happen too
EVERY WEEK THE USA DOES SOMETHING TO IRRITATE CHINA. 1) NEW BASES IN PHILIPINES  2) NEW SUPPORT FOT TIWAN 3) US NAVY SHIPS NEAR DISPUTED SOUTH CHINA SEAS  4) CHINA BUZZING USA FIGHTERS 5) USN  SENDING SHIPS THRU FORMOSA STRAIT  6) USA BANS ON HAUWAY  7)USA RUNNING A CAMPAIGNE AGINST CHINA'S BELT AND ROADS PROJECTS IN ASIA, AFRICA, WEST INDIES. SO NOW CHINA IS NEEDLING THE USA WITH THESE UFO'S
Asking the following question because I don’t know the answer and the thought frightens me.   Is THIS a way to transport nuclear objects without alerting anyone until the objects are over the territory where they are to be dropped?  Does anyone know enough to intelligently answer this question?  Thank you.  ☘️🌝🌲
Bull 💩 .
UFOs are real but this is bullcrap
3 years ago today, gas was $ 1.87 a gallon.   Eggs were  $1 a dozen.   Mortgage rates were 3%.   Inflation was less than 1%.   We had full employment, economic growth, and world peace.    What happened ?   I say very loudly,  they keep taking us for fools you the  globalist English narcissistic progressives.   P.S.  The leader of the RMT Union in England, has made a statement last week.   What I am about to make you aware of,  is absolute dynamite.    He has said and I quote.   ''  We are not stopping the rail strike until Britain is made a communist Country ''.   Is this man born here ?   Did his parents flee a communist country ?    Were we asked about his family and relatives to come  here and breed  ?   Time to smell the coffee my America.   Oh, there is much much more to come my America, much more , believe me these people hate us.
Aliens
One of the principles of hunting is to only shoot at legitimate targets that you are sure of.....and, don't bother to take photos.
Was it stationary?
This is a scheme to make china modest
If it's cylindrical there was a Japanese drone that was round there is research on it and works like a mav drone would not surprise me if it can dive under water, This was around 2011.
Let’s hope the FBI does a better job with this than they did with Hunters laptop.
This whole thing is just fishy as hell and the silence from officials isn’t helping. Why are we hearing from everyone except the pilots, officials, etc. and why direct this one to China or Russia unless we know something about it? Fishy fishy fishy
2018 was the last normal year we had
We come in peace
Let one fly though the country so then they think they can keep getting away with it. Never should have allowed the first one to pass though as far as it got .
They are quick to say it was a UFO. But in the same sentence say they don't know where it came from, where is it know, etc. You just don't shoot at something and then  not have any answers. That's the police's job.
Many sightings of these mysterious object that are taller than width, no wings, no propulsion sound, constructed from  triangular panels at different angles -silently cruising over areas at night have been observed over the years.
CNN, you guys are clowns.  Let's hire an "ex CIA operative" to guess at what the government is going to totally cover up.  There is no such thing as an "ex CIA operative", he is a CIA operative working for a fReE jOuRnAlIsM outlet that is a government mouth piece because of who you hire, who owns you, and who sponsors you.  No wonder I don't watch this garbage channel anymore.
You KNOW this is an entirely Government Scam when NOBODY on ANY of the nitwit networks asks ANY questions about 'the photos'.
Could it be a mav like drone?  So annoyed we can't get info
I thought there were rules about not shooting down a craft you cannot identify.
They’re going to make them shoot down 1,000 of them until they make the leaders go insane.
UFO. THIS UFO WAS SOLD BY CHINA TO MARTIANS. BIDEN SHOULD IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON BOTH MARS AND CHINA!!!
Where are the camera footages
Area 51 called. They want their missing balloons back.
this is usa try have war with china..now you will see,,so many baloons so on.. yes is real,,but,usa make them to give public reason..reason with war with china is ,,china is economic power now..and military wamt make money by selling armaments
What a crock of typical yank shite
Natasha' comment so nice and qualified
Call x files, murder and falder
No propulsion, anti gravity technology?
What ever they are theyre not being verry discrete    got to be aliens
I smell a hoax to be honest. This sounds chillingly familiar to WMDs in Iraq or safe and effective Covid vaccines.
"....makes no sense to me."......Then, WHY did you have this IDIOT on for his 'expert' commentary?
I went frequency hopping yesterday and didn't see anything out of the ordinary
Didn’t know the aliens buy their stuff from the Chinese….
They’ll call you nuts??? Not anyone who is alive and sane. The military videos speak for themselves. This is alien technology.
A balloon possibly doesn't need a real "propulsion" system.... IF...there is way to change altitude which "captures" jet stream winds that go in different directions. All you need is up/down control.
CNN playing us for idiots.
Chinese? Or is it North Korea? Or Russia?

Jim Acosta is too good for CNN.
This is offensive commentary, CNN. WHERE ARE THE PHOTOS?
Photos would be good
More about it here  -  https://youtube.com/shorts/SHYZVRsIf-I?feature=share
https://youtube.com/shorts/SHYZVRsIf-I?feature=share
Not sure why many commenters feel this needs to be made public and that the govt owes us an explanation? There are certain things that are simply kept secret unless necessary to be made public. Thats how govt intel works.
Aliens ! 😆
We’re the pilots from the lgbt community 🤔
What is this fake crap your spitting. Where's the REAL NEWS CNN! WHY IS THERE DANGEROUS SMOKE FLOATING OVER MY OHIO HOME!?? Yet no mention about the evacuations and deadly smoke floating over northern ohio?!!
F22 : We success shot down the ufo. Alien : they shot down our expired drone from 1000 BC. We have the the new on land no human can detect 🤪😂😂😂
How come you keep saying f35 it was f22 . This is the problem with cnn they can’t even use the right information they just make it up as they go
Aliens
Hey CNN, your "expert" kinda sucked.  Anyone off the street could have done better with that ambiguous garbage
We might have just started an Intergalactic War 😂🤣🤔
Wake-up the Unwoke, Smell the Coffee. Hang on it's gonna be one hellofa ride..🙏❤️‍🩹⚘️
Don’t say aliens.  They’ll call you nuts.
Aliens clearly
Do not trust anything from CNN.
Lmao 😂 , they didn’t know how they stayed up , balloons float ffs ….
The FBI? The Dane cook of federal detectives?... Definitely NOT extra terrestrial life lol you need people of actual intelligence to investigate that sorta stuff. It feels like the feds were just like, "You dipshits figure it out, I'm going out for coffee." XD
This is very scary esp since capt ding dong (*rump) had financial ties with China and stole classified military docs.  Docs sold to the highest bidder?! Just saying.
It must have been Aliens ..
US media and commentary have got it all wrong. China was not happy with Bliken’s attempt to bully them into meeting. Because of Chinas lack of enthusiasm Bliken used the balloon incident to cancel meeting and save face. This the dominant narrative coming from within china.
Aliens from Independence Day the movie, the old man was actually rite 💯💯
Why release a statement and give no facts? Could they have just not said nothing at all if their are no pictures taken from civilians or any evidence what’s the point.. So many bots spitting alien bs y’all are pathetic. Anything UFO/Alien related is all made up and fed up by Hollywood. Remember those videos shot with 360p camera with ufo’s, all fake “clickbait” of the modern day. Maybe CNN will cover lochness and big foot if it fulfills a role.
It was ALIENS!!!!    I just wanted to say it first, before the guy from Ancient aliens said it.
If they don’t get this sorted by December, Santa is going to be in serious danger! 😂
UFO
Ice meltdown.
Admiral Byrd! Ha
it was probably just a cloud...
balloons, what else, they were always just balloons 😂😂 but now they can fly with mach 6
How much more bulldo we need hu  they do know very well so cut the crap
If it came from outer space. There would be nuclear energy on it
Garbage
They brought him on to say it is a mystery, also these planes go so fast it is no wonder they saw different things,
Clowns 🤡 🤡 🤡 🤡 🤡 🤡
There's always one fucking clown who will mention the x files when a ufo or uap is the topic, grow up ffs.
Why they are always UFOs in America?! Here in Europe it’s really boring without the green ones 👽
Its Elons Tesla
Mulder said, "the truth is out there."
The day the earth stood still
Look guys I got a feeling we’re gonna be seeing the Death Star in the coming weeks
Does anyone actually believe any of this?  Clearly they're hiding something!
Will hear come the lies.. they won't tell us the truth 😔😔😔😔
F-35 or F-22 make up your mind. Main stream media rubbish. No wonder no one trusts you...
When the Alien Mothership will appears in the space, it will send a coded message saying: Shoot now if you are so brave.
You fools the objects that are over Canada on what the Navy has experienced they come in peace stop shooting them down you're going to start an Interstellar war that you cannot win
Show us the photos dumbfawks
Ufo
If Chinese:  war tension, political bs, or just deflection.  If NOT: ……… Me Run fast 💨
Stop shooting down ET's stuff or they will get mad and start shooting back!
Interesting, there's an uptick on unidentified aircraft.
My guess is they are timing how long it takes the Us to shoot down these balloons or unidentified objects, more then likely they could start sending nuclear bombs , the objects made it all the way to Michigan. This is scary stuff.
One pilot is lying as is always the case with UFOs for no reason since the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash.
Remember when they included the UFO sighting documents in the stimulus bill…. It was for some reason. Also how long has this been going on. I doubt this is the first true series of events. Something is about to go down in the near future.
Don’t forget! What one hand is doing! What is the other one doing.
Our govt is so full of shit these days it's hard to believe anything coming out of D.C.
Alien tech bruh
Oh ffs why are they being so vague? What is the object? Was it another balloon? Was it metallic. What color? Size? Shape? They make it sound like we shooting down aliens. The lack of information just makes it worse. I dont understand why they cant give basic information or ask basic questions. If you want to be secretive, why say anything? Just keep it to yourself.
Take them to our dumbass leader.
Nobody is comprehending what this truly means, the balloons made it all the way to our Country without being shot down, now they know that these balloons can travel, next thing you know they will be sending bombs.
All of a sudden we're supposed to believe that aliens are the enemy. Joe Biden is the enemy.
They put Jim Acosta on for a bulshit story, typical ..
There was no reason to shoot down a UFO posing no threat.. but as always typical Military shooting first
BE CAREFUL ON WHO YOU BELIEVE TO BE THE GOOD GUYS.     LIES OF WAR FOG...........
Pilots clearly need a GoPro.
I was fine till the guest lied......
She's playing up the UFO angle. CNN doing what they do.
It was a russian tank turret from Bakhmut.
This is all BS 😆 🤣 😂
So it is now been confirmed that the Chinese balloon was a spy balloon ?????
They aren’t releasing any photos or footage because it didn’t happen! I’m not sure why the lies yet… I believe it’s a distraction of some type.
I Want to Believe  THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE  - X-Files
Roswell alaska
Could be UFOs with Chinese characteristics!!! Aliens with slant eyes & pig tails!!! Mr. Mulder (of X-Files), are you still with FBI???
Everything sounds suspicious. I have a feeling someone is playing us. Definitely not ET. Maybe a diversión tactic?
Putin was emboldened to invade Ukraine because he knows Biden’s controlled and incompetent. I guess it’s Jinping’s turn to take advantage of  Captain Dementia.
I think a lot of the information , video , will be held back until they know what it is , meaning they don't know 🤔
"Distraction" Hunter Biden,family and friends
Great use of military assets. Shooting down loose birthday party helium balloons that got away from some kids. LOL <-----
Change UFO  to WTFDIS ...what the f.... did I see
Democrats the true enemy of usa
Who is this guy? Just calling them balloons when even the government has said they are not balloons but objects. Silly billy.
США - соединённая шайка агрессоров сбила зонд китайцев, в то время как 10 американских зондов летают над Китаем.
TRUTH is always the FIRST CASUALTY   in   WAR!
I want to see some photos Cmon we live in the digital age We don’t have to wait for them to be developed???!!!!!??
. thanks America for starting Wars on aliens.. starting Wars on earth is so yesterday..
I like to see video recording
They was coming to get me  for a party 🤪Just got dropped back off at home🤷🏾🤣
Sounds like another episode of the X-Files
Im not saying it's aliens. But it is aliens!
Fighter jets have no chance in hell intercepting and shooting down a UFO or UAP as they'call them now plus if it was a UFO. Do you think they would tell us?
Don't be surprised if the movie independents day comes to life,just like the movie, they been know about aliens being here on earth and choose not to say anything  until everyone sees it
That makes no sense over 4000 miles an hour is mock 6 so how is that possible if it's a balloon,  You do know we're living in the age of Google so we can find out how fast,  That would be one h*** of a jet stream. 43 miles above the Earth's surfthe top speed is around a 135 miles per hour so explain a balloon going mock 6.
so itching to go to war keep coming up with excuses and we're gonna be there.
Either way, the pilots did report that the object was causing interference with their sensors. Why do you suppose that is??? 😡  ~ APRIL LIPKE
So, are we in an intergalactic war?
May be it is a test to the US's defence services.
Why do we even listen to these news briefs? They are fabricated stories being distributed from our government.
this is so bait
These flying objects could contain anything from chemical ,biological or radiological  weapon,nothing in this world would surprise me. Not even if they are claimed to be Extra terrestrial thou that I doubt they are. Strange times eh?
What’s more likely.. Extraterrestrials or a foreign military (Russia/China), probing our territory.. As much as everyone wants a otherworldly explanation, its probably a security breach that shifts our military posture/readiness..
Two years ago they showed us videos of 🛸 UFO’s and said they will let us know something in 4-6 months, then Covid-19 hit, Trump with his Big Lie, Trump supporters Attacking the Capital, MTG with her Jewish Space Lasers, and her Holocaust is the same as wearing a mask,  Matt Gates with under age girls,  Trump tried to steal 11,780 votes, Trump played down the virus, Trump says Putin is savvy and brilliant for invading Ukraine,  January 6th Committee, Trump’s tax fraud, Trump takes the 5th,  Trump takes classified documents, Biden as VP takes Classified Documents, Mike Pence as VP takes Classified Documents,  China sends spy Balloon, Know back to UFO’s ..  Like the movie Don’t look up …
Payohan mo si kuya bong baka magkasa magkasakit wag uminom ng hard liqourpowde ann beer powde naman restday lang aalis
IT WAS ALIENS!
One more fake news 🙊🙉🙈 and  poor American believe it 🫠🫠
We come in PEACE 👿
Aliens
Dudes! Make up your mind! Is this the same object that an f-22 shot down near Mayo, Yukon Canada?
It would be hilarious if China or Russia claimed to have shot down an unidentified object as well.  Then it might be a cold war scheme of saying: "We got advanced alien tech now, so be careful."  Maybe that's what they did with Roswell in 1947 🤣 Release a statement about having unidentified objects and them keeping quiet to keep the enemy guessing.    Honestly no ordinary citizen knows.
They want you to shoot them down, there probably full of bio weaponry, it's going right into the clouds. Or it's Russian intelligence., Russia and china are probably working together. There's more 2 it, they got satellites to spy.
There is something they are hiding from us 🤔
Exactly! Most comments seem right on. People the U.S. has finally told the public they exist, UFO's now UAP'S. We've been spoonfed what they know we can handle right now. This whole thing is actually quite unbelievable that now that the ball is rolling it seems to really be happening quickly- probably why things have been kept out of the general public's eyes, and ears. This is the sort of thing made possible to explain through nightmares and things many people think they've seen or heard in the night. We have no idea, but I feel if we continue to shoot down objects w/out knowing what's what, well we best be prepared for the consequences. Whatever they may be. I think we are in for a terrible reckoning though.
Cant be alien. They wouldnt need to test our defense system😂😂.
Who has death by Zentraedi armada bombardment in their armageddon bingo?
Opppps another spy ballon yeah i smell bullsh** too
Let's just say, if your about to launch an invasion of Taiwan, you want to know as much as possible about your enemy as possible.
Comrades, welcome to Soviet Amerika. State-run media...believe them, comrades. Big, classified stories? Sure; make them public since is all manufactured wackiness! Why for government do this things? Dumbkoff! To distract from senile, pedophile crime boss in White House, ya? It work, comrade. Yes, like X-Files. Like fake 2020 election; hesteal election, son's laptop covered up by FBI! Oh yes; can trust FBI, very solid organyzzation. This is good reporting. Very good. Hokay, comrades! Back to your vodka! Is nothing to see here in lunatic, criminal White House! Look instead at the UFOs! Look here! Look there!
This is so public because we are witnessing the beginnings of the “Fake Alien Invasion” that we have been hearing whispers of since 2020. This is just the beginning. There will be more shot down this week.
ET blown home?
I fall in love with reporter girl!
The Bible says in end times people would see strange lights/things in the sky.
👽👾👽👾👽👾👽👾👽👾👽👾👽👾👽👾👽👾👽
Humans still pointed weapons at each other, they have no reason to show themselves up or initiate contact, we haven’t earned it as a responsible being in this universe.
Natasha Bertrand - Yummy yummy yummy!
India will help the world 🌍
How do you target and shoot down something that you can't even describe in form and function?
They F N know if it's a UFO there not fooling anybody
CNN is a joke, LOL! These two have NO CLUE about anything 🤣
It had to be purposefully sent here to be shot down, that's the only way I can see this happening, maybe the put something on it for us to learn about them so that we won't shoot them down, I mean that would be the smartest thing to do lol  "just send it, they'll shoot it and find all the suprises inside lol they have to know exactly how we would react before they even did it
Aliens? Bring them on! Let 2023 be an extraordinary year :D
Tell us what we want to know! We as taxpayers pay your freaking salary! I hate this planet
All they need to say is it's a UFO 🛸 these 🤡 always hiding stuff
wrap one natasha for me pls
That the media can't even decide which fighter was involved??  Solid work there.  Lots of confidence.  The former CIA guy was almost as useless/awful as the co-host.  Good thing there's nothing else to worry about, like human overpopulation.  Let's keep distracting everyone with worthless crap like fashion and celebrities and idiots like Musk who need to stay in their own lane.  Personally, I hope ET is finally making a proper debut.  I can't wait to hear what they have to say about the so-called smartest species on Earth.
EN ESTE GENOCIDIO LOS PSICOPATAS QUE GOBIERNAN NOS TIENEN AMORDAZADOS.
Pay attention don't fall for the banana in the tail pipe, get the public all worked up scared and nervous and pass some new BS to say it's for your protection. When has anything like this been made so public it's a fear tactic. Allah the Patriot Act
The U.S. the first country to shoot down a UFO!! 🇺🇸😎 Now this is a legit American flex 💪
Mulder and partner is on the way to Alaska
Aliens
Probably all staged distracted from Bidens classified document scandal.  If that wouldn't have happened.. this probably wouldn't be in the news either.
You'd think that when they read the name GOODYEAR on the side of the "cylindrical object" , they might have held off shooting it down,
its either... the USA who have put their own balloon up there and have said its the chinese... to start up some noise... because USA want to keep up the CHINA THREAT!!! if CHINA really wanted to provoke USA... they would bring their airforce over near the border... and their navy and just play on the border...  they would sail up the south china seas where USA have one of their 10s of bases ... its NOT CHINA!!!! CHINA NEVER DOES THIS!!!! its someone else trying to provoke a war...
There are so many things happening on so many fronts. This almost forces us to react just as humans. We have to find reasons to come together and quick to avoid the approaching challenges. For example AI. We can't let them take jobs away like truck drivers or people will lose their purpose and humanity is at stake. And countless other examples. SUPPORT VIEWS THAT WE SHARE IN COMMON. Like anti-corruption. We can't continue to allow our government to sell us out to places like China.
Can wait for the joe rogan pod on this to find out what the hell is really going on here …
Then millions of them will come back with vengeance then will inform all humans that why did you attacked us? 🧐
Don’t forget that they are being very vague about what it is they saw and there is not video or photos of whatever it is. Hopefully it’s not a staged invasion with man made top secret stuff.
Most likely drones from China. There's no need for silly conspiracy theories about alien space ships.
It's ironic that they spoke about how the pilots reports are conflicted, then the channels own report was conflicted, when she said that F35's were scrambled to shoot it down, then the graphic said F22's shot it down 😄
These past few days watching my crypto portfolio decline is very disheartening. Holding doesn't really profit much. Any idea on how to earn better on the short run?
It's obvious to me that they're completely dancing around that we are dealing with a UFO..  no propulsion system it's going super fast making terms doing things that none of our equipment can do and we've got the best equipment in the world. China's not even close on most equipment that we got,  to what we can do. so it's not Chinese it's not Russian because you can see what Russia has and they got nothing compared to what we've got.. There aint nobody else in the world's got anything compared to what we got so it tells you what's going on.. this is a UFO and they're covering it up..  the balloon yes that was China..  but whatever the h*** they've shot down up in Alaska and canada..  they got no idea what it is and they are just dancing around the truth.. cause they aren't going to tell us any more about it..  it will get covered up.. something will happen and it will just be forgotten.. wait and see... unless they are actually going to tell us what's really going on.. I doubt that will happen but you never know....
I swear they are slowly leaking that Alien life exists.    Service guarantees citizenship.   Would you like to know more?
There are rogue factions in USAs goverment. That said, those rogue factions are equipped with extraordinarily advanced tech and would NEVER be shut down by current peasentry "air craft" (who do not even anti grav tech). Its also NOT a UAP, these off world people have craft so advanced they simply blink in and out of current vibratory phase reality. Even with 1000.0000 volts being shot at them. So, potentialy, its another curious baloon🤔🤔 What I find amusing is why the Pentagoons are announcing it publicly for the peasantry? (How US gov perceives its citizens. FACT).
We get instant and pictures galore of the Tyre Nichols video but zilch on these objects.... Hmmmmm
2023: the year we make first contact
Call me a conspiracy theorist...but...Trump is going to be running for orifice again...he probably had some of his cronies...paste some asian labels on a "flying volvo" (now owned by chinese car company geely/no kidding look up geely and volvo and china in/on wikapedia)  Trump is doing this to both embarrass the Biden Administration so he can win 2024 and to shame China because he blames them for covid and why he wasn't reelected...DO YOU RESEARCH FOLKS!!!
They're comming!!!!!!!!!
Those planes record ALL in our skies.  If they don’t The CIA. NASA.  All of the abbreviations.    Someone knows more than something.   🛸 ufo  sounds to me
if it not man made and Alien I don't think we would be able to shoot it down..
Imagine being invaded by aliens 🗿💀🗿
Its called sowing the seeds in your mind.. What is in the collective consciousness is the name of the game. You will see more and more of these "UFO" themed events appearing closer and closer in time. It will either lead to disclosure or the fake alien invasion scenario. The judges as yet are still not out. Those numpties at CNN report just as they are being told 💩
They’re Here!!!!!!
Those darn Wakandan drones!
Look, it ain’t extraterrestrial.  We wouldn’t be able to shoot it down. It’s Chinese.  If the government says it’s extraterrestrial, it’s probably the start of Project Blue Beam.  And it’s shocking how few videos there are on it on YouTube from the “conspiracy theorists” on YouTube.
they already screwed up lol. this is just damage control on a narrative that went awry. it's nothing folks.. move along.
Of it's a balloon why would it need a propulsion system?
Another deception from America, that's what they're good at
Conflicting accounts because they are holograms.  Project Blue Book.  Fake alien invasion coming in the next couple of years.
Government continues to lie to the American taxpayers
Dammmmmm🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
How fast was the thing going, couldn't out run our jets, but if there are aliens, they'll be housed in a nice hotel in NY and given money,food & clothes......
*AS A EUROPEAN* watching this the PARANOIA America has is both hysterical and terrifying - this is the paranoia of a collapsing empire and its going to start a war
If you could tell what it was, you would. Nothing makes them happier then claiming they know. I hope this steers the public closer to realizing we have been retrieving craft with "indiscernible propulsion systems" for about 80 years.
I find it interesting nobody mentions if the objects were stationary or moving, and what speed.  Not the military is telling nor journalists are asking.
So NORAD couldn't say or give assistance? Also at 30,000 ft  it would have been observable on civilian radar, and also how could it get into U.S. airspace with no he the wiser? SAM sites didn't alert on it, no civilian agency became suspicious of an object at that altitude with no iden. This stinks of a psychological ops distraction.
Cnn reporting fake news
All cool, that are the small green guys, they visiting me for a long time, always in the night hours over the balcony. They always start cleaning my room, working here and there - I leave them alone…if it is fun for them.
The weather in Alaska was horrible / different jetsngoing different speeds …how could they see the same thing when they could barley see at all
Give me a break - No obvious propulsion just means it doesn't appear to have its own propulsion; and the wind (jet stream) is blowing it.
spoiler alert, its not a ufo its just a really well made rc plane.
UFOS  ? Really? Didn't see this coming.
Tell California I want my patent for Rain back. Some men drink the rain and then turn to thank the clouds… If they use it again without my permission, I will send Governor to the Gobi.  Precipitate from Silver Iodide is my patent as a discoverer and government entity.  It is not for sale to Military or elites like the equipment and people were in Kabul. Each person sold as a commercial commodity at auction, for decades, for the sake of being able to party using product from ch8 and France, because NATO was raping the American people, especially the military integration schemes at Westpoint.

Ima say it. I swear to Jesus Han Christ if we just shot down a legit ufo I’m going to Australia.
If it seems impossible and you have eliminated everything probable. Especially that is highly unlikely. When everything has been eliminated what's left is the most likely outcome. "(Aliens) worried because they know our future and are trying desperately to get us to change our Waring ways! These ships are ours from the Future and Us inside of them. America dont shoot what you dont understand out of fear. Force it to land!!!!
A small car sized aircraft? Where can I get one?
Fake news CNN. Washington swamping sleeping Joe Biden weakness so with china and Russia and  Americans people thank over classifieds document way weakness on china and Russia Ukraine
comments from the pilots? they most likely would not be spreading rumors.
No visible propulsion equiels alien.
They said CNN stop talking bullshit
Geez I want to see the lil green martians so what's up with this?
Madonna was just shot down!
BS. We have hundreds of documented sights and never and attacked from them, now they are a thread? How stupid this people think we are. This smells like a manipulation scam. Let see what information they feed us next….. 😒
A new case for Sculder and Mully
Weather balloon....
Can't for the life of me understand why a spy balloon would be white. Why wouldn't it be grey or blue? There's a reason fighter jets are the color they are...
The Engineers have returned
138$ Millions F22 but no camera ?
*WE DIDNT KNOW WHAT IT WAS* and as Americans, we are scared of things we do not understand  - so we shot it
Could it come from N Korea?
*IF IT IS ALIENS* trust America to have started a war with them...!!!
Why couldn't they take a photograph of it..?🤔
AATIP confirmed ufos in 2019 in the NYT article.
This news is crap you clowns not sharing real info
Sounds like another Roswell incident lol…
Stop giving us this bs 4 crafts shot down by pilots with jets that have cameras and we don’t know what it is stop it !!!!
Aliens, just in time to take the front page away from the U.S. government crimes, how convenient.
I think it may be the ball of the penalty missed by the English player during the past football World Cup
Malaysian Airlines??
1974 – 1977, Werner Von Braun began privately telling Carol Rosin, a colleague at a major aerospace company Fairchild Industries, about a sequence of contrived global false flag “cards” such as asteroid impacts and extraterrestrial invasion, which would lead to the militarization of space and usher in a New World Order.
Shooting down stuff you haven't identified is really careless. We are too trigger happy.
What's going on ?
Release the images !!
She said f34 LOL
A flying object can gather intelligence no matter how fast or slow it is flying.
twitter files collusion distraction?
FBI = UFO 🛸 alien 👽
🛸🤔
What kind of analysis is that? The U.S. has the most advanced fighter aircraft and surveillance in the world and they give such a vague description of the object?
I hope it are the aliens...
This is just one of many events that will and have been unfolding before our eyes for many many years. It's all part of a master plan.  Eventually there will be a fake alien invasion which will unite the human people. Us against them. This will usher in the one world government. If you think I sound like a crazy conspiracy theorist ,it's because you are brainwashed into thinking that way.  It is time to wake up!  It is time! 11:11 But first our governments will work together in creating deadly viruses, deadly weather, and fake wars to lower the population. The less there are of us the easier it is to control us.
It's not uncommon for pilots to give conflicting accounts. Among obvious reasons, like pressure, it probably plays a small part that we drug them when they fly. With 100% oxygen. That will increase your alertness and improve neural blood flow, but can lead to small illusions/alucinosis.
Perfect timing, since we've decifered most of the technology from the alien ship at Roswell. Hopefully, there's plenty we can get from this new one.
look away , look at these UFO's ! Don't look where it matters, look away , look look ! UFO's !!!! JUST LOOK !
More misinformation.
🛸
biden got all kinds of shit for letting the first balloon fly over so now they are finding all kinds of stuff and shooting it down lollll wowwww what a coincidence
Didn't NORAD upgrade there radar recently? If this is space faring life then we just made the first move. Of course it would be USA that starts something with intelligence life from outer space.
Their expert is speaking gaubly goop
YES .....BECAUSE ALIENS INVADE US WITH BALLOONS ..WHAT A LOAD OF NONSENSE
If the surface of the object does not say, Made in China then its gotta be aliens
The Democratic party FBI is investigating 😄
Wow
They say its China, Who said its China?? Where's that info come from??
CNN IS FAKE ASF. Wtf
It was Santa
Why not collect pictures?
I don't even watch movies anymore. Just turn on the news and CSPAN 😆😂.
Flying saucer of little green men...?
They are Turks's fathers ! You wait !
Yüzyıllardır çağırdık gelince de vurduk
Hi Natasha!
Uhuru banned the use of paperbags in Kenya completely. Where was this one blown from? Let's clean the environment.
China PLA wishes to warn Blinken that China is no longer a "pushover" by US and that Balloons are proof of China PLS Capabilities to snoop into Biden backyards at will!
What a pointless interview
it came from trisolaris
This is how they suck you in then spin the story, make you worry about the future. Then tell you what the solution must be!!!
If NORAD can know it's Santa when they see him on Christmas Eve, how can they not know what this is!? 😆
Too much secrets
Natasha is the most beautiful and intelligent woman on CNN.
This was clearly Santa's elves making Santa's route ready for Christmas, why would we shoot them down !! Well you nasty people driving dem planes are definitely on da naughty list !!!!
After a pandemic, if we have an alien invasion in my lifetime, I will be really annoyed 😂😂
They will never give you any details ? It is of course spying objects ? Could be some light weight new clear bomb in this balloons in the future ? For now those balloons might be only testing provocations ? Never relax on Chinese traps ? Evil regimes always want to control the world ? This days , China is the most Dangares country ? America have to begin to think seriously to prepper to not deal with very populated country's , because they are hungry and thirsty to dominate the world , like China , India , Iran , Turkey , Russia , North Korea ? Some sanctions against those countries will be good strategy ? Nato countries with out been greedy should make gently trade between each other financially , militarily and to control the peace in the world ? May be ? -  might be too late to correct our mistakes ? Pray to JESUS to protect us ?
The aliens finally got curious about us.  So sorry.
They are coming
It sounds like anti gravity  by movement. The tail s would distort perception of view from looking at in any direction.  A microve oven would leave no heat signature. I believe
Not just “off of Alaskan coast”, Canadian Prime minister said it was shot down in Yukon, Canada by US Fighters under a treaty which allows Canadian/American forces to intercept airspace during unforeseen circumstances or incidences like these. Doesn’t make sense to me.
CNN"s security and intelligence analyst sounds like he"s already decided for us what it is, and also that we are interrupting his naptime.
The cnn guy let something slip when he said official found no spy equipment aboard did any one else notice
It belongs to some small school science project for budding scientists. What a dumb country.
Did they just made the female reporter "accidentally" assume it's from the Chinese or Russian? 🙄 they are trying so hard to hide something
Natasha Bertrand is an incredible journalist
The reason the Chinese released the balloon was to purposely interrupt the US visit to China and  that’s exactly what happened. WHY Would China do this?🤔 it’s simple.☝️🤨 because China is still experiencing many omicron deaths all over the country. Plus many cities are under protest. They don’t want US politicians seeing any of this, so it’s best to cancel the US visit until things get a little bit more under control by the CCP standards
Show the possible spaceship already....
Conflicting informations , what king of pilots are they?
The Chineese are eating too much rice and drinking too much Socki, I've been saying this for years!!!!! 😜🤪🤔😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😁😆🤣
Is it alien to this planet through 🤷🏾‍♂️
Hmmm... I'm curious. Let's hope they show us EVERYTHING.
It was jimmy neutron guys, GOTTA BLAST 💥
Maybe the aliens are about to snuff us out, we won't have to wait for an asteroid, lol
Yeah...  Darned China lobbing old refridgerators at us.
Ufo
Pilotos always see crazy shit, why is the press talking about it this time 🧐   And why do they always blame China?
It is whatever the government says it is. Don't question the literature and don't ask for evidence!
Well no one seems to know what it was or where it came from? Let hope that its not Alien to earth or a Alien rescue team will come to see what happen.
I feel like I'm living in another war of the world hoax
Perhaps some are unidentified flying phenomenon? UFO’s?
You very lucky that you found  that target. Now  just  laugh, when fingered  out   ,  the UFO  became  just. FO!
this is probably to distract from the train accident in Ohio
Eiter we are incompetent or its aliens..Or its a psyop..
Falkor better get his affairs in order cos they're shooting everything down.
She said F-35.  Text said F-22.  Now that's a conflicting account!
It's just as mysterious as George Santos. Should you hold a briefing with the FTIPOTUS of the US, DJT or perhaps Marjorie Trailer Greene would have some inside knowledge?!?
I'm thinking not the balloon the other one they shot is a u f o they don't want to say bet they whont show a pic of that one
Et phone 📱,  home. The object is from mars........CNN, your news piece, is sooo boring 😴........ come on man 👨.
Congressional Twitter File hearings are going on right now and this stuff takes attention away from the fact that the Democrats fully violated the 1st amendment. Government branches like FBI literally colluded with big pharma and big tech to censor world renowned doctors on Covid. This is not a theory, the pfizer leaks and twitter files are abolute historical facts.   Just something to remember if you're wondering why they report on these things now but never reported on the 5000 UFOs they intercepted / shot down in the last decade.
A kids science project?
it is an alien invasion and the world should unite. they want our nukes so lets give them the nukes..
Oh! Shit they shot down the E.xtra T.esticle😆
So the military don’t know if it’s a balloon or not? This is Roswell all over again.
Fear from Russia and China is so ingrained into the minds of Americans that they can’t see outside the box. If they don’t understand it it’s obviously from China or Russia. Both theses countries are also shooting down the same kind of thing. It’s time to be concerned
If it was an octagon moving at a very high speed then shooting something down you can't indentify is a very bad move as you'll make enemies with the wrong species that could destroy us.
It's UFO
Order balloons from China. Send them back with HELIUM!  🤡👻
1st it was the Chinese virus now it's the Chinese spy ballon.
What about that Navy video capture of a UFO vanishing into ocean off the coast of San Diego?
Need to fly 24/7. Now days. Not just set and watch TV raider.
Chemical & Biological Attacks??
Maybe a coincidence of course but on same day they say no propulsion system visible on it .. I posted about UFO I saw that is a box or cube that doesn't fly .. it moves . Is this latest one  from earth ? Maybe don't shoot em all down irrespective.
I’m an alien
How to deplete enemy munitions - 🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈 balloons! 🐥♥️🥳
ALIENS! OH PLEASE LET IT BE ALIENS! MY FOIL HATE IS RDY!
Bet it was a flying Tesla roadster

Was it pig shaped?
*woosh* I am the night
We'll see tons of comments from conspiracy theories lovers after showing us debris of chinese spy air vehicle !
Did we just blow up E.T.??
Fake news to help with CNN failure ratings
Well there are 4 now! One over the great lakes today. They may be sitting on the info for security reasons. They may want to make sure they didn't make a blunder, like shoot down some school child's science project!
Hope the aliens take the all the whyte ppl....we had our turn.
Isn't Natasha pretty as hell !?
The compass needle moves via magnetism.  Electricity and magnetism are two sides of the same coin, so to speak.  Electricity is amplified via coils.  Propulsion is there for the taking for whomever harnesses the earth's magnetic fields and amplifies them for that purpose.
I don't think there was "obviously a propulsion system" on the one shot down near Alaska. If it was a balloon, which it sounds like it probably was, a propulsion system would make it much heavier. I'd wager that it was made of a material like mylar which might make it scatter radar in odd ways and make it seem like it was messing with sensors. Remember the homemade balloon a few years back that supposedly had some moron's kid on board? Wasn't that made out of mylar? That's silvery and reflective and easy to make into whatever shape you might want to shape it into. I imagine the one near Lake Huron (or both) could easily be the same thing and it wouldn't surprise me if it was launched by some Republican crank looking to create a little havoc for his "Let's go, Brandon" scrapbook. Could also be some sort of stupid game the Norks, China, or Russia is playing to stir up some good old conspiracies and get the Q-Anon types riled up. Be really interesting to see what info is released about these things and what sort of nonsense the goofball conspiracy hacks start spewing over the next few days. Going to start popping some popcorn now so I'll have something to munch on while I watch the crazy train run off the tracks.
We may be getting more bio‐warfare from China
Something was shot down in Alaska, and that’s all the information we have, any questions?
Maybe they are not spy balloons. Maybe they are dumping something on us?? Maybe we are under attack in a sneaky way? If our skin starts falling off our bones before we figure out whats happening, we could be done for!!! Better start worrying! Maybe they are coming from Russia?
Wag the 🐕... 😴⏰️
Perhaps these engagements have been a reality for decades. I hope we are safe. I'm going to be brave.
Invasion of the Slant eyed Aliens !
USA can only identify big balloons in the air..... anything apart from that is a UFO.... What are drones for anyway?
Coming from CNN !? - you must be ****'ing joking, who still listens to this Bullshit News . . . . . . .😆
We are all going to be freaking out about this stuff one of these days.
IT WAS A UFO!!!!! :)
Sigh……
if it was shot down, the ufo let it happen, probably so that we can learn their propulsion engine to better earth
It was Jesus.
VIDEO PLEASE...BROADCAST NETWORKS, WHERE ARE YOUR FOIA REQUESTS??? You're the 4th Estate. Act like it!
If all is loss....... You can always blame Trump
Lost my drone. Anyone seen it?
The biggest clue will be a spike in late night Chinese takeout at Area 51. Or... maybe they've banned the Chinese takeout in favor of pizza. TikTok and Chinese takeout are probably verboten at USG facilities anymore. Tiktok... Chinese takeout... USG... MSG.... definitely something suspicious going on here. 🧐
I hope they don't put a other virus in it.
what was the speed of the objects... crickets :-)
1) Government collects wreckage of actual UAP in 1940's, others throughout the years, re-build them into working units that appear to be UFO's. 2) Government decides that the time is right to use reproduced ARV's to work up public panic about UAP's and foreign air invaders. 3) Government shoots down own high-tech ARV (UAP) and recovers wreckage, but this time "admits" it's "alien" and that they're a threat 4) Government militarizes space even more in order to protect against ET "threat".
Mrs Christmas sat at home waiting for santa, he went out for shopping days ago
👽...relatives?... it's been decades....⚡🕳️
Testing US alert?
I for one welcome our new alien overlords. 👽🛸😅
Americans hallucinating again.Eating toooo much wild mushrooms???
Oh she’s nice ❤
Why does everyone feel entitled to know what this is. As always we will get fed the filtered info once the government has finished creating its cover story. Nothing to see here folks
How impressive. The administration that can't even close a wide open border that's killing thousands of people with the flow of drugs coming in are more concerned about a balloon that was probably launched by darfa  to begin with.   What a disgrace and joke
Hopefully the aliens will come and interbreed with us to improve the species.  The 1st steps in this plan are underway.  I will expose NO more details than that.  But you had better get prepared.  Your god will not help you on this one, it's going to happen. Enjoy.
They are all talking but at the same time not saying anything. I wonder what they're hiding from the public.
Our time is running out
Why don’t they show the photos of the new ufos? 🛸
UFO
Anybody know what the Balloon Boy Hoax family is up to these days? 😂
It’s not like the government will share the truth with us anyway.
What is happening here is simple. These things have been around for years it's what the Pentagon tried to pretend was balloons last year and they had to admit it wasn't that.   In my opinion the Chinese realized these things flying around here since the last couple of years made the Chinese send the balloons to spy on these things. It would make sense why china isn't talking much and why we still can't say completely what these balloons and things were. They know neither of them know what is and are competing to find out.
Your thoughts on the current controlled extraterrestrial reality disclosure process and related US GOV cover-up? When the contagious giggling subsides, how will our civilization adapt to this publicly known reality?       What might be some of the potential implications of disclosure of this reality? New energy sources perhaps? Religions? History?     Do we really want to know the full truth?
Fake. Just trying to keep the people distracted from the fact they blew up the Nord Stream Pipe line.
Come on they are among us, I wonder for how long the government will hide this truth from us.
imagine they ( aliens ) came in peace for 1st contact and usa destroyed them ahahah
Looks like the Tik Tac is back💊
Footage where is the footage.
Deflecting attention from Ukraine. They are not very analytical are they (CNN)?
If it is a ufo, did the us govt just declare war on an alien race?
Lol just a giant distraction. Don’t worry about it guys. Live life to the fullest . Family and God for the win.
Meanwhile, in ohio, while everyone is looking where they want, a huge ecological disaster is happening.
We are alone on this planet not other planet this one …..
This has got to be the most elaborate gender reveal yet!
No one cears about UFOs report on the pipeline
They come from future
Why are they calling them all Chinese balloons lol just say the objects are being investigated
Tic Tac?
Ezekiel saw that wheel Way in the middle of the air
As if pilots will tell us.  Stupid.   Big distraction for you all fools.  Fact CNN n main stream media doing this coverage shows its fake.  USA  canada preparing for nuclear war.
Kids and there toys probably
they've been planning a war with aliens for awhile  . . . . . don't believe them !
We are going to f*** with aliens and we are going to regret this
Let’s fool the normal people again for another 20 years! 😂
I have a hard time believing all of them are from China lol
Soon as I heard the FBI will be taking the lead, you know there is a cover up about to happen...
Since trump built the wall I guess these are the illigal 👽 aliens 👾 the GOP is so worried about.
This whole balloon saga is all about propaganda staged to gain support for war. Remember that the majority of your citizens don't want a major conflict with Russia and China, so they make these things up with the powerful news media on their side to distort the minds of people. So tell me how powerful nations didn't detect these balloons earlier when they entered your airspace? It's very questionable.
Its like in Movies…Aliens just know USA😂…feel save in Europe…want to thanks personally to the Aliens Map Drawer 🤝☺️
why do you keep assuming that it is "Chinese Spy" Balloon when there are still no proof yet... This just proof you are Racist!!!
Oh, now I understand  .  It's almost  as if this is about tech and someone trying to give it to us. .. if what they are saying is true...they know those last ones are not China..
It wasn't the type of UFO that people think of in movies, it was a spy aircraft. The US has Oil infrastructure there and 2 military bases within a few hundred miles, they just don't want to say whos it was because it would make relations worse with China than they already are, oh oops spoilers i guess.
Ask chatGPT. The answer will amaze you with good information lead.
"Frequency hopping" came right out of his a**. fh has nothing to do with differing descriptions.
It’s a Tesla 😂😂 y’all need to ask Elon Musk!! Seriously I’ve got a feeling he’s got hands on it.. he’s done made many comments of things like this.
Behold a Pale Horse - Milton William Bill Cooper
This is a distraction!!! Look at what is going on in congress!!! look at what is going on around the world politically! This is purely a distraction!
I can just see Trudeau picking up the phone with my mind's eye... speaking the words staunchly but almost whispering into the speaker "Joe... shoot that bogie down bro, over..."
Oh great!  We shot down ET.
this is probably a psyop to put doubts in china's and russia's minds and make them react behind the scenes in a way which US can elicit useful strategic information.
Hope they are from planet earth
UFO from an unknown planet??? Eek!
Only 2 pilots two. Stop adding a dozen to the drama.
It’s common for two people to see two different things. 😑
imagine how pissed off the aliens must have been that the Americans shot down their equipment.😱
Start calling these things cotton eyed Joe. Where did you come from where did you go?
The real danger is.. What if hundreds or even thousands of balloons are launched, with a malicious payload attached.  🤔 even more concerning is, realizing that Americas multitrillion dollar industrialized military apparatus can be defeated by balloons.
I think this a whole bunch of hog wash. They want to sent the media and very gullible public into a frenzy and make them believe that China is about to attack or do something crazy soon. China will not dare to attack America or any other nuclear powered nation and it only takes common sense to understand that they don't need balloons in this day to spy on anyone. They're already doing that better than anyone else with their satellites and data leaks through electricity back doors on mobile phones etc. So a few sophisticated planes couldn't identify what this was and though it didn't have a propulsion system it was able to take off at great speed before the planes got there . Give me a break. We need to check what else is going down big time while this distraction is up in the air.
It's a UFO ladies and gentlemen I cannot believe they're talkin about this probably shot down for the first time
Will there be pictures? Please...
If theyre aliens we are fucking them up lmao
Aliens
Like they will ever tell us the truth, it sounds more like a UAP, and if so then that is not good, invite other life from other planets to visit earth then shoot them down, I may be totally wrong but this sounds like something similar to accounts from pilots from disclosure
Still won't call it a balloon? 🤔
Mars Attacks!
Foo Fighers returned to watch WWIII
It's either #1. Alien tech or #2. Very high tech that the major powers (China, Russia, USA) have that's being used as tensions rise to coming war.
Shape-shifting Chinese technology
One of the fighter jocks saw Stacey Abrams fly by on her Stratoflattner.
2019 the Chinese unveiled a helicopter that is engineered as a flying saucer. has stealth coating and high tech weapons. speculation on my part. but it seems this could be what we are seeing. or another form of it.
Scary how many of these have been sighted some even over military outposts, what if it were carrying emps over one of our missile defense, that could be disastrous.
"Chinese spy balloon" Lol. Why would the Chinese send an un-steerable balloon to spy on the US when they could just get one of the millions of Chinese people who live in the US to grab some DJI drone footage if they wanted a closer look at something?
All bs!
Okay now it could be me one of the first things a hunter safety is that takes you to identify your target
This proves this is a deception
I think they shot down the grub hub burritto. On serious note shouldn't we raise the def con level
I was hoping to hear what the pilots said. Not what was reported they said.
So the US shot down a actual UFO as did the Russkies?
This guy says it was 5 balloons .I thought at the beginning they said 4 were unidentified
At this point, it would almost be a relief to be aliens 😂😂😂
IT IS ALIEN 👾 FOR SURE!!!  I WONDER IF THE GOVERNMENT WILL SHARE WHAT THEY FIND......I DON'T THINK SO!  IT WILL CAUSE PANIC AROUND THE WORLD!!
All I can say, if it is an alien.. it’s a bad time to come visit, apparently we are effectively able to kill UFO’s..
I would think American actions like these as stoopid except, as always, they already know what's happening and, as always, must keep it from the public they're meant to protect - we can't harm the Govs precious project by "knowing what's happening" - they are covering up the fact that this is Japanese/USA equipment in wrong hands. Did they sell it or was it stolen? Either way, it will embarrass the West, the only reason they would do their usual thing, and hide it from a harmless and maybe nervous public that they CLAIM to protect. In reality, they are protecting themselves as always (/-_•)\
If we shoot their probes down they will figure we are unfriendly assholes and they will wipe us out.
Maybe this is the "Tic-Tac" UAPs the navy pilots are talking about??
Just trust the FBI. They always tell the truth. Right??
Just imagine it's not from any other country but watching our military all together..
So we shot down E.T. that's what their saying....like wth is actually happening? Also, what people don't understand is that in order to shoot the craft down, the pilot has to get a site picture and lock tone. So they'd at least get somewhat of an idea of what the craft looks like. They'd also would have to describe the object back to whoever is giving the orders, too, shoot. That being said, I believe that there is no way these pilots are talking. Not a single word. I'm not sure where the news is getting their info, but it most definitely isn't from them.
UFO TECHNOLOGY.
It has to be some form of drone, first a balloon now a star wars sky speeder?? someone's trolling us
They cannot recognise a duck on thermal camera
Damn any media or group who would hide the truth from we the people
🛸 👽
Many thanks to USAMERICA for being vigilant on making sure that air space  is always SAFE AND SECURITY is enforce  between 🇨🇦  and America 🇺🇸
No, it's not unusual at all that different pilots give different accounts. This dramatization of the totally typical dynamic of human fallibility in observation will doubtless contribute to MORE conspiracy BS. You should have led off with the CIA guy... But then you wouldn't be able to shamelessly clickbait those who will believe this is extra terrestrial or conspiratorial.
Not another Roswell ?
TY dear sweet govt for treating us all like mature well balanced people , we appreciate being kept in the dark until the last possible moment . We love not knowing how to prepare for threats looming like your dear friends and loved ones get to.
There wouldn't be debris if they popped a jacket of lightly weighted netting over it, instead of "popping" them over 7 miles of deep sea (/-_•)\
I love Natasha Bertrand. I've followed her on Twitter for years, since the beginning of the Trump usurpation. It's a nod to her credibility, obvious since those days, that she's on CNN now. A salute to her.
No footage either (/°•°)\
It doesn’t take much at all to”float” and stay airborne but propulsion for forward momentum is a bit trickier to do without fuel/engine…. Have no clue who it belongs to because EVERYTHING on earth has “Made In China” stamped on it? (nearly everything atleast?)
"Conflicting" accounts? 🤔
The American population is the most misled, distracted & entertained population from the real stuff happening around the world. There are so many issues to be dealt with but the President & his cronies have given the population this nonscnense. This country is funding a war in Europe with 100B dollars & wants to go to war with China
Nobody knows. About those UFO's, nobody knows but me . Nobody knows the nasty UFO's. Nobody knows but me .
They just shot down another balloon over one of the Great lakes China is not sending this spy equipment for no reason something  is going to happen people you need to put back a lot of extra water food and fuel for your car if you live next to any major military bases I would leave for a little while or near any major nuclear facilities are nuclear power plants I would leave for a little while the president of the communist CCP  party of China just told his people few months ago to stop investing in the United States they are fixing to attack Taiwan and they are anticipating that we will attack them so they will attack us first several Chinese refugees have crossed the southern border lots of them are probably spies they can put poison in our reservoir they can attack our electrical grids and cause all kinds of chaos something is going to happen people pay attention
This is a big nothing burger, it is possible for signals to interfere with one object and not another. .
Aliens or not they shouldn't be in our damn airspace.
Why is it that Radio Control aircraft have to have a remote ID to under 400 feet, and they can fly were ever they want?????
UFO enthusiasts stonks :D  pbbl some chinese drone
Just like us humans to start a intergalactic war.
Cant wait for them to stage silly thing that caused the commotion
and then people wonder why canadian geese are so aggressive....
i always cringe whenever americans (especially journalists) say "miles" instead of kilometres. get with the metric system already, 'murica.
This is crearly an alien artifact. No doubts 😁
Roswell....revisited???
*Hollywood Fiction Movie 🎬* —The US knows how to keep the place and stay in the news.
Feels like something of significance is being kept from us. They have to know more than what we’re being told
This is a lie 🤥 a big one they know more
Hmmmm... weird
Impeach Biden, don’t forget classified files
The beginning of project bluebeam, maybe?
There here . UFO are real shot down a spaceship 🚀
These are testflights for using pathogens! ! Very cheap and effective way for releasing pathogens even when shot down very effective!
I guess I’ll take the aliens versus a China take over
Wow , if you believe anything Jim Acosta reports then you believe propaganda because that is all he reports. no truth in anything he says.
Cancel world war 3! It’s time to fight aliens!
ALIENS ARE HERE 😅
Human's can now forget about finding life on other worlds. If eager intelligent aliens wishes to make contact with human's on earth. But totally avoid planet earth and it inhabitants in the fear of having there ships shot down by fighter planes. Or to retaliate against earthling as in the movie Indepedence day.
Make no mistake if it was a UFO  of unknown origin they would not disclose anything resembling the truth
I dont wanna say its aliens but its aloens
FBI and Rcmp ??? Isn't this a MAJIC 12 file???
Covid-19 didn't work to fool the people. The Russians aren't going to start a war. So last chance to get the people to their knees --->>> the ALIENS 👽 are coming 😅🤣😂!!!
I saw, a ufo 2 weeks ago... These things are real
You see, he fill the gap...coming from China, Russia......already invasion from enemies....
Project blue beam
Mysterious letting all filling the gap.....and speaking, speaking, and speaking...
I've come up with a conspiracy theory for what's going on. Totally plausible. Not at all far fetched... so basically, the US is fighting off an alien invasion and they asked China to send over a 'spy' balloon to get the American public to not ask questions about all these UFO's they've been shooting down. What do you think?
Maybe it was alien craft.
oh crap they shot down the Jetsons
Thankyou pilots. Thankyiu. USA for protecting us
War drums
Cowboys in the air.
All of the objects are from CHINA. 😁😁😁
I can't wait for the new back to the future movie 🙌
MUST BE ALIENS!!!!!👽
Alien invasion be coming ... humin softened with coovid ... mulder and skully are old farts ... time abide by 80s alien flag surrender
Mach 6!
I wonder if there's a flying saucer attack or invasion imminent?why can't answers be given? I wonder what's going on?
Its the threat wink wink. That we will be saved from and yall will beg for brandon to tell you what you knowand feel secure once more
Everything they say is a lie so everything they say should not be taken seriously.
WTF people.  Get your stuff together.
Aliens man.
Ok. Everyone get ready, definitely aliens are upset now and on their way messing around with one of their kids paper plane.
The one shot down near Lake Huron is said to be octagonal. WTF?
The government and media lie to you. And people are stupid. Like cattle.
Lets hope these balloons arent being sent to drop weapons in payloads that can later be attained and moved to target locations.
Nothing better than an international crisis to distract a divided government from Ukraine.
Can we see the dam object please
Can’t go to war without scaring the American public. Here we go…AGAIN!
As we play 'catch up' and we actually Do Catch Up... Perhaps we will see that perhaps these are objects from places that we wont be able to conceive of or understand until we can be on the same level or close...     Are we hearing this all correctly... Or are we tripping out on politics still...
sounds like utter bs and scaremongering to me...
During WW2 the Japanese launched thousands of balloons into the Jetstream. These balloons carried anti-personnel bombs and incendiary bombs. The Japanese scientist had been able to calculate time and distance and equipped the balloons with  altimeter controls to ensure they would fall on Americas west coast. Literally hundreds made it to Canada the US and Mexico. The plan was to set the forests on fire and cause chaos for America. The bombs did cause casualties, some years after the war ended, after they were discovered and set off by people curious of discovering what they had found. At first they were thought harmless weather balloons.
Ayy lmao
Project blue beam!!!
Another UFO?
Programming progressing right on schedule.  Not long now.
A moron president and incompetent military leaders , they should All be fired down the chain of command !! These objects should have been spotted  A hundred miles off the mainland , hundreds of billions a year and they can’t spot a balloon!!! What next the taliban floating over and dropping dirty bombs .
United States military air force shot down Two UAPs  spacecrafts in Yukon Canada
Has anyone asked the question "could the object be privately owned?" Sounds like something Elon would do ;)
Don't trust Bob.  Those pilots are extreamly competent.  They described their accounts as the trained pilots that they are.  I'd trust them.   I believe it must be more and not the Chinese version, if you get my drift.    Odd, back in 47, in Roswell what did they find? A weather balloon. Imagine that.    If aliens, (ET's), were to do surveillance, then that sounds like a good way to go undetected, and if it was desvcoverrd, as these were, it would appear to be... Ok, everyone together now... a weather balloon.  What a perfect cover.
I do not know what this is but remember people, The devil will come down from the heavens as a shining light saying he is God and to worship him. This is the beginning of the end times. I do not know if this is that, but lets all be watchful and careful. Next thing we all know a world leader will take everything over and most will worship him.
Once a CIA, always CIA.  They’re the best at misinformation and disinformation.  I trust what the pilots say more than a former CIA agent.
No one has said anything about using these to send biological weapons to release them into our country.
Psy op.  ...I'll believe these habitual liars when they provide proof.
Humans can travel at Mach nine!   NASA has accomplished this!
A Chinese drone..we don't have the ability to shoot down alien technology.
It’s the Packlid from Star Trek 😂
After watching the footage of the Wreckage Debris. We must Conclude that BUZZ LIGHTYEAR IS NO LONGER WITH US.. Just another TOYSTORY
Our military up there shooting down flight of a navigator ships "Compliance" 👀
Listen to me please Micheal Jackson is directly responsible. Heehee sniff my penis condolences.
Probes from the mother ship.
Roswell ‘47 was also a weather balloon, so they say.  History doesn’t always repeat but it certainly rhymes.
HOW COME THEY ARE SO EASILY SHOT  NOW!!?? BEFORE THEY WERE TOO FAST TO EVEN CHASE!!!
I like the Independence day movies🤨
“The games Chess not Checkers”. We’re just psychologically flexing.😌🇺🇸
Igi gi ... the Watchers are watching 👀 😳
Did that guy say mock 6 because I haven't heard of anything like that before coming out of Chin?
They gave us live footage of the balloon being shot down also pictures… BUT they can’t give us information about this “objects” China, Rusia, Australia and North Korea spotted one also… I think aliens are coming… 🤷🏽‍♂️
Can be UAP?
All show, the purpose is to scare the people, so they are behind an attack on China ! Dems like war, special now, the petro dollar is collapsing. Why don't they shot a small hole in the balloon for a soft landing ?
Those Asians and their Chinese spy balloons 🇨🇳🇷🇺🇰🇵 are violating our country's space rights 🇺🇸 it's time to stop this communist threat that is invading us little by little and bringing the information they want, especially Xi Jiping and Vladimir Putin 🔥
Cnn is nothing but propaganda
They need to talk to Bob lazar 👽👽👽👍👍👍
Wooohoo 👽👽come take me home \😄/
Stop! This guy. Jeez, even after the US government has admitted to Actually UFoS. Come on stop being pussys. We are not alone. I have a question for you. Do you believe in God, Jesus.... ect.? When was the last time you saw him. This isn't an attack of faith or religion. I believe in faith to a higher power. My God gave me the ability to have a brain and evolve as a human.
Our government is keeping the truth from us. It makes me wonder why?
Show us a picture
Demonic craft or military PSYOP
So the space aliens are as STUPID and effed  up as we are. WHAT WHY Well  The biggest bunch of idots ever assembled are in charge of the USA and the Super HIGH techy space alien's let them shot down their  super duper higher advacended then US air avionic maneuverability .But they Let Joe shoot  them down ahahahahahah  What a bunch of complete tools the aliens  must Be.. Or More fear Fear B.S? Just better TRUST the government  or the alien will get YOU is the message .
This is such poor reporting.
If something, anything from Planet Zog,which is a long way away, managed to get here the chances of earthlings being able to shoot it down wouldn't be great.
Here you go. https://youtu.be/vjFG-4Ge668
Cuz  its a lie
Omg now the Aliens know that our Planet is habitated. 🥶
是不是还要把中国扯进去？😂把大家都当傻子吗？
Since when to air force pilots tell cnn anything.
keep focus Americans!!!!!!! this is a look here and not over there kinda thing!!!  Don't fall for this ask yourself what they are really hiding in these areas that they dont want alot of attention or the majority of the citizens seeing????
Can't believe that a nation with such a huge military budget and cutting-edge military technology is not capable to get a visual / understand what a stationary object is, take it down without destroying it, and retrieve the pieces in a timely manner.  That doesn't really give us much confidence in the militaries capabilities to defend us, in case these objects had a hostile intent. Actually I'm not surprised, after the 9/11 fuckup..   Or they already know everything, but they are just feeding us bullshit?
Why aren’t they able to locate it on the radar before it hit our airspace.  Take a pictures.
And a cherry picked commentator who tries to deflect blame from the CCP and put it on a rogue Chinese military! Pure Biden blasphemy
Hypersonic missile testing 🇺🇸 security systems.  Lol 🇺🇸
If China can go to these lengths to get data from USA then imagine how much data they are collecting from you guys using their apps and companies. (TikTok) India became aware of it and banned TikTok long back.
"Are you sure you're not just being paranoid," said every oblivious American.....🙄
That’s be we know Sam well what it was aliens we have so much technology and we still don’t know and as far as our pilots y’all need to blow the whistle the American people should be the first to know we get attacked by ANYONE or anything I wanna be fucking ready not have to get ready we should be the first to know oh hey china mite attack us or hey that was an alien stay home and pick up your guns pack a lunch not let us go about our day & get hit with something if we did this to china fly balloons over china that many times they would would bomb us no questions  seems like china is testing us they have plan to bomb or something cleary and we need to act fast this is BS
Can't even live in Alaska
Demons
Could be an inflated fortune cookie
Why shoot it down if you don't know what it is?
"unlike the balloon this required more immediate action.." So, CNN still making excuses for useless Joe by trying to justify his slow response to the initial attack
Biden is compromised , he has sold out the country
Wow, this is the 5th video that propagates maybe it's Russia or China we don't know bullsh   spit right? Be sure to spell ouwt ur wurdz lieke a dumbess so tha algoreithem dontuh throa ur openyun ouwt tha doar
they are just saving face for the major screw up last time ...
It’s always amusing when it’s a state run….I mean mainstream media agency….that releases this story.
I am sure i saw a cnn newscaster at the helm of that space balloon.He bailed out just in time before Tom Cruise shot him down.Unfortunately the space pilot could not swim and drowned himself in a big lake.
I call bs on everything shot down after the spy balloon. Where is the pictures of these objects? If you can shoot it down you can take a picture of it.
And yet other news outlets are saying the government has said this was also a BALLOON
Just like with the weather balloon why would they admit to anything. Their moto is deny, lie and hide anything they can. Wonder why they let a Chinese Spy Balloon make it across America, Now this... Hmmmm
I’m am sure it’s an advanced drone built by some college students to prank US military 😂
Wow, this gal is beautiful and intelligent. Well spoken, confident... She has a great career ahead of herself.
It's probably the cartels trying a new tactic of dropping drug's 🤣
It's really suspicious... 🤔🤔🤔 When they shot down the balloon which obviously its technology is nothing valuable, they are quick to release many information... When they shot down an Unidentified Flying Aircraft, they never releasing it... which!!! according to this video "they couldn't identify any propulsion system"--- looks like this is an alien technology they got... what a very lucky bastards!
Jim , we know you get it….I wish your bosses would wake up…this is alien tech. It’s real….accepting there  are multi dimensional beings will be as fundamental to humanity as the invention of the wheel, the advent of farming, discovering electricity….strap in
It's ALIEN. LMFAO
The war of the worlds have begun. Watch for the alien death rays in retaliation.
Project blue beam?

Cmon millennials show me your hands,  cause your all  F |_| [  |《|《€  | ]  !!!!!
The FBI ok right
Holyfuckspititout already
Distractions
They are back!
Another bullshit story by NWO 😩😩😩 Alian invasion... A bit to late,people are woken up.
China and the Soviet preparong for war
The beginning of "Project Blue Beam", it's just a start... they are gonna release unbelievable things soon.
It makes sense cause they found a gap in our defense system and china can send small flying balloons or something else and maybe drop viruses.
Who in the gubberment is releasing the information for the public and why ? The military SHOULD be taking care of it discreetly and the public should never know.
Probably just a mylar balloon
CNN is desperate for viewer's
Bullshit those pilots would never reveal classified information. They would end up dishonorably discharged after leaving Leavenworth military prison.
it should be easy to determine what the materials are if there made by man everything that's made by man comes from a past technology CCP like a bad pet owner that you asked to pick up the poop but everyday you find more out of spite
Don't forget Trump created Space Force.
The FBI taking the lead? We’d be better off with a kindergarten class taking the lead.
Getting people to look the other way…what’s really going on?
This is what we call a DISTRACTION.
Someone ok’d it for some reason.
They came in peace...  We shot it down...  Mothership is on it's way to Independence Day us! 😉
There getting ready to make a move on us
To much Hollywood 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We don't have technology and other countries do not have technology of no propulsion aircraft, its probably aleins.
Probably a drone! NO fucken UFO! THEY ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY TOO ADVANVE TO GET SHOY DOWN BY AMERICANS LOL
Alien Master Overlords watching us and Ukraine war , to be ready to dominate us and to Peg us during our nightly abductions, these objects are just simple their broadcast devices.
ufo
I'm not saying it's aliens but.. I'm sure the truth is out there 👽👽😅😅
There are more Questions we will know more.han answers right now, Maybe in a month
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 fake 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣
they are trying an EMP strike possibly .... they are trying to take our powergrid out and send us bk to pre industrial days
Mitch Pileggi voice-over - "As the audience is focused on what the magician wants them to see, they fail to notice the sleight of hand in the background. The spectacle: merely a distraction."
Operation blue beam in effect
👽👽👽👽👽👽👽🤫
Wouldn't it be something if it was a genuine alien UFO?  Most likely it's something from China, but...
This is some hokey shit going on with our government
I;LL BET YOU A MILLION BUCKS IT IS THE ALIENS!
Professionals. At that.  Nothing . Pause. Replay again?
What object? No pics and details lol 😂
This is how they will ease us into the announcement of aliens being here. If it was made by man, they would tell us. They haven't, there's a reason for that. I'm OK with the next step of finding out, lay it on me government.
5g towers ….they can’t shoot down alien intelligence also some ships departed the green comet
What was going mach6?? Why didn't the interviewer followup on that!???
Wheres also a video of the other objects?
Since the Chinese is not complaining about this one... We should be worried 😅
China or Russia are sizing us up. Collecting information on our capabilities.
Why is noone demanding an answer from jinping, putin, jongun, taliban, israel?? Why are there no photos? Why haven't we or don't we simply remove biden and harris immediately put speaker Mcarthy in?
I'm not saying it's aliens...but it's aliens! Every sci Fi movie where the aliens get their asses kicked should end with; This documentary made possible by Earth Space Force. Maybe deter a few from attacking.
Aliens are trolling the U.S.A.
Leave it to the crazy news network to rouse everyone up...
wow, these objects are way out of range, aren’t they supposed to be flying near Area 51?
I can't believe CNN is still on the air
Where is the camera 📷 footage ⁉️🤔🍺🍺🍺🍺
Russia is partners with China. So western media is taking jabs at China. biden is friends with zelensky,. since when does biden care about the u.s. military but to use them for his leftist invasions. I say the military should stand down or they’re going to end up in ww3. It’s going to be the bloodiest battle, no democrat or republican should stand for such a great loss of life.
Finally CNN is getting serious That's scary 🥹
They didn't claim it was Russian or Chinese right away to the publicp and havnt told us what exactly it is so I think we can all assume it's a real ufo and continue our life never knowing the answer of what it actually was.
It's my guess it is a scouting op with different designs in order to see what is noticed and what is not. The concern should be the ones that are not reported or discovered.
You don't really believe (if it is a space alien drone) that they are going to tell you do you really ?. It will be a balloon and posed no threat....case closed. We will NEVER know the truth . Only way is if 10 million of these drones start showing up all over the world. Aliens don't want us to destroy the world with nuclear war, they are monitoring us. They been watching us a very long time , esp. since now every nation has the power to destroy earth.
Another retired armchair analyst telling us what he thinks. Why don't they just wait until they have definite information? This routine is old CNN.
China is just laughing at us.  As we argue about pronouns, they are running surveillance on us military sites
Where is the evidence!!!!!!!!???
I got dibs on the license plate..........
t was a unmanned alien drone vehicle from the main alien airship that watches over our planet using the gravitational system based upon the element 115
Good thing we can skip all that "who blew up the pipline" bs and talk about these UFOs.
It's Trump's fault
What if this things they use to  carry another "Viral Weapon" to spread another pandemic? We in deep shit!
one word Its a UFO
At that altitude, it HAS to be either:  1) Flying very fast, with wings, to stay aloft  or 2) Inflated like a balloon.   The Biden gov't says it's neither.
Since when do they disclose and show pictures of the scene so fast … THEY WANT US TO SEE THIS
Anyone contact Bob Lazar? Secureteam10? Why waste time with these CNN hacks? They aren't going to know anything. Their specialty is in disinformation.
Here we go with the bullshit alien agenda...Don't fall for this shit people
Soon, the MOTHERSHIP will arrive to defend its BABIES that we shot down🤪👽🤪👽👁
I bet they won’t find debris?
12 year old national security reporter.😂
Some may be balloons, some may be true UFO/UAP. GET CORBELL ON THE CASE!
are they saying it is not a balloon?  ALIENS?
What about the jets cameras recording.??
All about fear and control .Stay in your house don't go outside don't visit relatives. Sound familiar.
Sounds like they’re just feeding us what we want to hear
I'm by no means a conspiracy theorist, but I don't believe anything was seen or shot from the sky and I am now wondering what I'm supposed to be distracted from by this bs
is some peers testing the response and the reaction of US Air Defense and the radar?
Purposely giving conflicting information is rule one. The CIA has said this many times…in movies at least lol
lies lies deception lies and deception again …. Your CNN
Don't the jets have cameras?
I remember an article a week or so ago that the Russian military was very active in the artic region.  I put my money that these are Russian made .
Stupid MR'er fighter jet pilots.  That was my interstellar Taxi, you know like Uber, coming to take me the F' away from this crazy planet.  and away from CNN FAKE NEWS.
Disclosure
Where is the footage?
they said they sendF-35 , but it mention it was shot down by F-22...   CNN ... its like your pointing to a Bradley Fighting Vehicle and said "that's a tank"
Sounds like the fake alien invasion scenario ( where the government rounds up everyone at FEMA facilities for our "safety") has entered phase 1.
Couldn’t just catch it?
The object was fake.
So is it 5 shot down now?  I know of 4
This is clearly a psy-op.  They have been telegraphing for a long time now that there will be an “alien invasion”.  Bob Baer is a well known CIA stooge and they’re trying to strike fear into a gullible public.
i don't think it has anything to do with UFOs, remember, supposed real UFOs can "freeze" nuclear weapons,  deactivate them in a second, whatever was shot down, is more likely human made.... maybe some experimental craft (black projects craft)
Roswell 2023
we are not alone, et is here
Please let it be my stoner ex bf's stupid drone, lost like his befuddled mind
Why are they talking about balloons when they admit they haven't recovered the debris? I'm sure the planes that shot them down have the capability to photograph the objects first. Did they not take any photographs of something they were sent to identify? All that I am hearing is "Well, we don't really know what these things are but China has balloons." I don't think these objects are from China. Let's hope the govt comes up with the truth before they start a war.
What? You come in peace to our planet? Guess what? We are are NOT a peaceful planet! We ARE hostile and paranoid!
100% it's aliens... Time to buy your survival buckets from the 700 club. Be sure to get your dick pills stocked up.
I almost hate to say this but...if China just attached bio weapons to these baloons they'd probably do some damage. Especially with us shooting them down in our own area.
No Vids or Pics?
*_I for one WELCOME our new alien overlords._*
The reason they are coming forward with part information is because they are slowly pushing forward alien/UFO disclosure.  It's another part of the plan they started few years ago. It's most likely a probe from other beings elsewhere.
First flirting with nuclear war with Russia, contesting China in the South China Sea now interstellar war.
Well, maybe it is not of this world.
Sounds like the beginning of "Independence Day".
Distraction lol
The FBI? Come on man; the FBI? They will do anything to try and stay relevant in this defund the FBI epoch.
Great, we've pissed them off.. now we're going to see the mothership within a week..👽
May be this could be new  future Warfare tactic of diversion to send thousands of Dummy flying objects and keep Air Force busy depleting their million dollars missiles shooting dummy objects in sky.
It's a AI drone gone wild
Get the FBI Involved, They Can Cover-Up Anything. Paid Liars Who Charge People Criminally if They Lie to Them. Most Pathetic Department in US Government.
Music starts playing........”here come the men in black”.......
No pictures or videos of this object.?  Why so quick to shoot this one down ?  And how do they know if the first one ,( balloon ) wasn't spreading some airborne contaminants across the USA?  Govt is looking pretty bad in how they handled this whole thing . And now China is claiming there's a UFO that they spotted and are going to shoot it down too. So who is really behind all these UFO's ? North Korea or Russia?? 🤔
If the objects were of alien origin this would be ground breaking world news . ✨🛸✨🇺🇸🌎 . The Military would say it was only a weather balloon , Similarly to Roswell crash 1947 .
Starting civil war 😂
🐣🐣🐤🤣😆😄😃🐥😀🐥😃😄😆😆🤣🐤🐣🐣🐣🐤
Aliens have received the message and have agreed to come and take Trump back to where he came from. About damn time.
Those fighter jets don't have cameras they should
We will NEVER know the truth of what it really is.
The presenters are paid actors. The Media and Government are the Nemesis of humanity. They work together only to divide us.
A Balloon through off my instruments too.  Don't feel bad airplaine military guys.
If NORAD can track Santa Claus around the world, they can surely figure out where these originated from!
Oh no they shot down Iron Man!
Please be aliens
Most interesting bit at the end of this video. A PLA revolt? If so, obviously the CIA had done a very good job there. 50% pay rise for all CIA employees.  Why was it able to stay stationary without visible propulsion? Well, when the FBI finally get to the crash site, I am certain that they will find a very long piece of string, 40,000 Feet to be precise, attached to the balloon.   Biden would have picked up the phone and personally thanked Xi JingPing for his rise in approval rating. A tough Commander In Chief had shown Americans that NO ONE, NOT even a damn balloon, can get away with invading America.
Roswell 2023
3 shoot downs in the last 3 days and the Military & civilian govt. is being much more tight lipped now. Something VERY STRANGE is happening.   If you saw the reports a few years ago about the F-18 pilot's encounter with the "Tic-Tac UFO" that craft was highly maneuverable and very fast. It evaded the F-18 following it very easily. These things taken down in the last 3 days didn't fly away at high speed when pursued by USAF fighter jets.
Let’s see the gun camera footage. Why not?
Object. What kind of object !! It's time to play it's been a Long Time coming.
fuck... did we just start the intergalactic war with aliens ???
Joe Biden is blocking investigation into Hunter Biden financial Records. Why???
I can easily feel that China and Russia are using one of the most powerful Machiavellianistique manipulate tactics: FEAR! I dealt with these kinds of guys at workplace, It's easy to understand their game now! Hope it helps!
Joe Biden are you calling your Son Hunter Biden a liar? Laptop, Pictures, Documents, Drug use, Showering with your daughter, Ladies of the Night, Illegal Handguns, 10% for the Big Guy, Over Sea's Flights.
Oh great, gonna send in the corrupt FBI to figure this out!!!
3 unidentified objects shot down in 3 days. No answers from the government. Makes sense.
Oh yeah what are these new objects we haven't known about four hundred years I mean wow what is this let's open this up to the world
CNN sucks.
UFO is real...  mother ship will be very anxious now :)
Just tell us the truth about another lifeform visiting us.
Did he just say the object was flying at Mach 6?  That's hypersonic.  No balloon could drift at hypersonic velocities.  Neither could any fighter jet in the US arsenal - as far as we know.  Do we know the path the object was following?  The first instance, the Chinese balloon, was drifting along with high-altitude air currents like the jet stream.  But instance #3 was apparently following a more northerly path.  So, WTH?
Ahh this is all bullshit
Remember the tic tac UFO??? I’m wondering if this could be related
"mach 6 shelved and figured out" what?
We need to STOP focusing on who blocked us on Twitter and start earning our $$!!
Well if this is on CNN you know it's fake!
Wheres the video?
If fake CNN is saying something like this you have to wonder what's really going on.
Cnn clowns
They getting us ready for something
This is a marketing stunt gone bad to promote the upcoming IT movie by Stephen King.
NOT LITTLE GREEN MEN..ITS AN AIRCRSFT FROM CHINA OR RUSSIA..LOL!!!NUFF-SAID.
Project blue beam is starting
Slow moving Tic Tac craft.
UFO
Atleast we all know Epstein didn't kill himself
Speaker of the House and Santos are relieved that they are not in spotlight anymore.😉Infotainment news are certainly feeding the masses with mental candy.
Two objects shot in usa after Turkey earthquake !
when the gov wants us to “know” something, it’s a lie or half truth. steering public view to prepare us for a specific goal such as justifying a war. I don’t like this at all!
Listen I know Trump is 🦇 💩 crazy but we need him back in office ASAP... I was afraid of what the world thought about us when Trump was in office because he's a buffoon and we were a laughing stock but no one messed with us
mommasita !!!
Trying to show Americans where there money is going lol
The conspiracy theorist planned fake ufo invasion is starting to unfold, I see.  Would be nice if they took mr turdeau and his communism away.
Seriously. Who the heck still believe in cnn news?
It’s obvious Russia testing our response time
Yes, thank you. Please defend us from mass hallucinations.🤮🥱😵‍💫🥴
What did biden do that they are covering up.seeing how the last balloon gave him the opportunity to let a terrorist that help plan 9/11 go so I wonder what else he has snuck in the back door
Lol this is a nice distraction
Well then, sounds like we're shooting down aliens and asking to get invaded.
They’re trying to make us spend massive resources on unknown objects.
Does anyone really believe any of this crap. pilots of F-35 don't leak anything and CNN their past speaks for itself
Aliens
Instead of shooting it down, why not try to capture it in a cargo net dragged behind a C-17 or C130. Drag it into the cargo bay intact. The way the USA used to recover recon film canisters in the 50 and 60's. Cheaper that a missile and no damage to the evidence??
Jim Acosta you i’d i o’t
It's another stupid test, LOTS of ya failed the last one 👨‍🔬
If one thing flying over our air space is from China than it's more than likely the others are too.
This all started with the “provocative” move by a billionaire launching a red car into the space.
Russia and China are going to get even with us for the Ukraine mess
They are shooting down alien ships.  Jesus becareful. We don't need interstellar destruction
Oh good. The fbi is looking into and handling it. They’ll get back to us for sure
Jeez aliens are simply trying to say hi and we go and shoot them down
They know what that object  is, the problem is ,they don’t want to show it to us.They think we are dum.
Time to start flooding the country/countries sending these objects with similar objects. See how they like it.
Hella click bait, we did not hear anything from the pilots haha 😂
I've been told it was the 'postman', for the Aliens. Now your in hot water.
FDA is a trader to the country!
Occam's razor...it's niot aliens.
Shot down like a CNN anchor career.
Spacedildo
Extraterrestrial aliens trying to make peaceful contact with humans and are met with military aggression.
Cam to See comments 🤣 - surprised nobody yet has said:  "I'm not saying it's Alien's. But Aliens" per Giorgio A. Tsoukalos you know him as the Crazy hair guy on the "History Channel" 🤣 ... but yeah 👽🤣😝🙄😏😋
Paybacks are hell, like karma. Like is what you get for abducting people against their will, probing etc if it turns out to be a UFO!
Wait, hmm….I’m wondering if this is apart of the ufo agencies objects.
Biden needs a huge distraction from his criminal activity. This sounds like bull sh^t to distract us from the recent  Hersch report that details how Biden committed an act of war against Germany by blowing up the ND2 and 2 pipelines.
If it's unknown, it gets shot at?  America!  Let's hope if aliens ever arrive they stay clear of that country.....
I agree w/krOnz-  No film footage !?  Cmom give it up to the public - Nothing released cept for 'Conflicting pilot sighting huh !?  No visible means of propulsion -  guess what ppl  - same ol same ol - HUSH HUSH  yep  fr  Canada
Car sized objects.  Get ready for a massive amount of these balloons due to damn kids and their pranks!!!!  I think there is a direct link between the difficulty in finding toilet paper during the pandemic, then the price of eggs.  Some of them delinquents got a little creative and soon they will all be doing it!  Old man, signing off.
He may have info we did not cause im not so exited
I guess they don't feel the public could handle it, so mum's the word 👽😁
My dad said your gonna fight the Chinese but im now 40. Throw me a gun and point the direction to kill and die. They may outnumber US but if that happened then they already underestimated that we have crazy and wild stupid also. I would gladly die trying to kill as many as possible if this country  was ever invaded buy whoever. I got nothing ta lose and I'm getting old and tired. I'm out of shape but not to bad. I gotta go get some glasses also. I'd be ready in no time. I got layers of warm enough clothes and a tent. Man they would be stupid because this country would Unite like never before. Its pretty sad that that's what it would take.
Finally! Full disclosure is coming!
I’m not surprised that the Biden administration doesn’t know what the objects are or where there from.
Have yu ever been scared to see things WC are not there yea hallucinations due to fear just like WMDs🤷
After the last administration debacle, this administration now would shoot down a duck to redeem themselves
It's very simple; the Aliens are concerned with us humans incapable of stopping our self-destruction  and are watching us.
WAY TO GO CNN.. PUT ON THE GOVERNMENT ~DISINFO~ GUY. We all know NOT ONE COUNTRY ON THIS PLANET, HAS A WINGLESS, TIC-TAC SHAPED DRONE OR PLANE. It is a UAP w/ an unknown propulsion system. This guy is a jagoff spin doctor. Typical CNN. Same with their political coverage. CNN always pushes the "whataboutism"  or  "BOTH SIDES get a turn". (Even though one side are government hating, media trashing,  POWER HUNGRY crazy people). Look at the very least, these two UAP's/UFO's are a probe or ship of questionable/unknown origins, possibly alien technology. We're all adults, so be honest, it is NOT RUSSIA or CHINA, or a weather balloon, or swamp gas, or human made.... Emm-K?
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH, ALL LIES.
UfO
We have Go Pros!!!!
false fla
I'm fucking terrified
It couldn’t be a UFO because then they wouldn’t be able to shot it.
It is my balloon, man
This sounds like the US wanna finally admit they have alien tech in a few years from now .. they going to come out with super techs and then say its from this haha lmao they already have these techs too just falseflagging.
We're falling into their trap.
These news articles are just giving info to whomever owns these unidentified objects intel on what they need to change in order for USA and Canada not to detect them
Go ahead after all we been through in the last four years The announcement of  Ww3 is small potatoes
While these sheeps are being entertained by some Super Bowl they shooting  things out of the sky
No secrets
One normal year is all im asking for.
During the Trump Administration the only excitement was Trump. Now we have a War in the Ukraine, a war with China in 2025, and UFOs!
Was it shaped like a cashew?  I hear flying cashews are quite common.  😀😁😇
I know a secret
This is absolutely astounding! It is the first hand proof that not even fighter pilots can identify worth a damn! So long lil green men! 😂😂😂
I for one, welcome our new alien overlords.
Apparently they took out the mothership in Eastern Ohio, so everything should go back to normal now. I don’t even remember what normal looks or feels like anymore though.
Not saying it’s aliens but it’s aliens 👽
Why does this matter? And if it does, why do they keep shooting everything?
This reporter is really pretty
It's definitely Aliens getting ready to invade earth. Someone page Jeff Goldblum!
Son las esferas del Dragón
What if it was a misdirection…all these balloons or whatever …while they shoot them down they are doing something else 🤔again a misdirection
Huge universe with millions of planets and solar systems. Y’all would be fools to think God only gave life to this one planet called Earth.   Still I don’t believe those are Aliens. More so unmarked surveillance planes from either Russia or China.
Totally B'S
If CNN said the sky was blue I wouldn't believe them.
We're at war now with whoever operates the UAP'S over our airspace.  I don't see how this will end well for any of us.
Just saying, if this is "alien" or non- human tech, advanced like the Nimitz tic tac, then we didn't shoot it down, they let us shoot it down. I doubt our weapons could do any damage to them. Pretty odd .
Maybe it’s the WEFCULT jab junkies dumping the Kuru Crazies doses in the waters.
Yea aliens. They looked more like Chinese
The tic tac pill again. Also we did not shoot it down!...we can barely train a camera on it as it flys through everybody's airspace.
well its no chinese balloon. lol
If it's aliens we just declared war.
What if they've had their eye on this thing for a while, and when they decided they were going to shoot it down, they staged the Chinese balloon with China. That way when they decide to tell us what this is, they'll just call it another surveillance device...lol
they look bad for missing the first couple so they made up these new ones to flex and pretend they are on top
What is the one thing you can do with a balloon that you can't do with a satellite? Drop a bomb.
UFO alien
China should send out more air balloons that can go as high as 200,000 feet to see how high the US F-22 can reach before the pilot pass out.
Failed to find the balloons right away so need to make up all these stories and act like we have gained back control of the sky.
Leave it to are government to start intergalactic war
So there are no photos or video and they don’t say how fast it was going. Seems very odd.
I have strong reason to believe we are under Martian attack.
The truth is out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF6o2-nx4I
WTF is "IT"
Tic Tac sales are about to sky rocket ld be marketing the be Jesus out of this scenario.
cnn reporting? fbi examining???  It may be like the laptop
Dont ask what they are showing you, ask why  they are...... We all know that they will blame china for it and we all know its war propaganda
Every modern jet fighter has video recording on them. Why not release those videos?
I am sure that after seeing our Congress in action these Aliens said to themselves (we better not get to close to these humans they are crazy). So we shot them down.
I would prefer to hear from got and military personnel who are currently servin, not retirees.
Wonder if this a distraction from the stuff Project Veritas just released about Pfizer and the fact they are about to release the Jeffrey epstein client list finally and time now.
If there are classified documents on this, then don't give them to Joe Biden please.
You know there are many objects listed as UFOs that they have no clue about, including USO (unidentified submersible object).
If he doesn't have pictures or details, just make up a story. Jesus CNN, where did you dig up this guy?
I think that message is for Biden directly!! The main point is for the USA to know that; no matter what that is, where it comes from, if extraterrestrial or not, or even from this galaxy… you bet your ass that it was made in China!
Guys, obviously it’s Chinese think about it. The Chinese already said they reserve the right to retaliate after we blew up there balloon obviously this is retaliation. It’s not fucking aliens. Stop being morons.
This administration is so deceitful,  we may not learn the real  truth.
ET is PiSSED !
We know this happened during the trump administration. They just went undetected. Question... if they went undetected how do we know they happened   Next Question please
Isn't Xi cheif of their army PLA?  Are u saying people under Xi defected him?  Your explanation makes no sense.    I am not a UFO crook but wouldnt be an Alien's stuff?    I guess i watch too many sci fi movies but at least it is better than your explanation.... :)
I'm sure that vaccine, lockdowns, face masks, individual car ban and cashless environment will stop hostile UFO😝 #WEF 🖕
Chinese schpy balloon shot down over Alashka yeshterday ?
Maybe the Martians have finally arrived!  😲😲😲
So y'all don't think nobody was waiting on wateva it was to come back ..so wat now
He just calming stated he was involved with a UFO going Mach 6...... Mach 6 is 4,094 MPH... the world fastest plane, SR-71, goes Mach 3.3 ~3500 MPH. Pretty obvious what's going on, just tell the people already
Ohio
this is getting expensive.
ufo
Hopefully they they choose to shoot these down with a simple burst from the gatlin rather than a missile, that way they aren't chasing down hundreds of scrap pieces..
Flying cylinder, eh?  Not a balloon?  Can't wait to see the footage.  At 5:19 he says .re: the object going Mach 6, "it was just shelved and figured out".  What does that mean?    I have long wondered if contact with alien intelligence would make humans see themselves more as family than foreign.  I hope so.
It must be aliens…why else would they hide the object?
BS ... I'm sure the pilot took a 1000 pictures before he shot the object. The intelligence community has all the answer...There are no mysteries, just BS for  public consumption.
Chinese Communist bankers laughing their ass off at how much is getting spent by DoD to pop a plastic bag
OH NO ? They Shot down ET ?💫🛸
All this hysteria for a U2 Superbowl commercial. Orson Wells would've been proud.
🛸 👽 👾 🛸 UFO.
This is just a cover up for shooting down the Chinese balloon
it's a HOCKEY PUCK....some Canadian used snowmobile salesman's ad  balloon got away...and USAF ...PLEASE find a cheaper way to shoot down a plastic bag. those gaddam missiles cost too much money.
sounds like they shot down UFOs
They shot down Marjorie Greene and her white balloon.  The air in her head kept her floating.
These objects are probably Foo Fighters, WW2 pilots use to report these incidents many times.
The violator of the safety and privacy is Assumption university of Thailand.  AU installed tape recorders hiding in the school offices.  After stealing teachers’ voice chat, AU uploaded theirs on social media without their awareness.  The violation led to deadly incidents.
The pilots are to busy flying their aircraft at incredible speeds  to make  detailed visual observations and full details of the UFO's .  But the recognition systems and cameras on their aircraft are constantly recording everything about the object and sharing it in real time with ground based  facilities. We the general public will never be told everything about the objects, possibly not even which country owned and sent them over the US and Canada, where it was launched from and which  other countries it passed over and was tracked by . And I for one don't really care. All I want to know is that we are being protected and safe.God only knows how many objects ,owned by which country are constantly traversing the skies and what their purpose is.
Hey. What is that? Dunno. Kill it. ??? Jesus these people are nuts
Who think it’s a trap for Russian/Chinese hackers?  UFO is just a Scapegoat.
Alian space craft wat else just say it weak as
Either Chinese or Russian, who else would send their stuff in that vicinity?
We’ve been shooting down these balloons without knowing what they have on them or even IN them.
These unidentified objects could also be decoys. Purpose: Russia or China can then carefully study our response, including all kinds of operational details of the F 22 running an interception, all kinds of communication patterns, how USA & Canada coordinate, etc. #FunTimes
Stop shooting things. If it was an Alien species, you could be declaring war. On top of it, it could be innocent.
White gurl named Natasha….word
Why has air travel not been stopped!  I highly doubt they would be telling us about this if it was real. Think!
Wheres the video instead we get a stone aged so called sightings.We are being lied too.
Do they have a camera on the missile to get close ups?
The object of these probes are to test defenses and response times. Our enemies feel the great squeeze. The world shall become one people.
E.T.
For all of the cnn audience, yes, you, you who cant think pass beyond the moment, and can’t afford to have a long term view with your life, keep buying all this bull.  Wait until we get closer to presidential elections, they’ll come up with flying unicorns and house eating giant bugs.
So much bs., if we can not bring down a ballon  by puncture,  bringing slow and down to heart,  we are idiot's.
Korea has been launching a lot of things in the past year. Why is nobody talking about them?
Thats the CIA guy from "Hunting Hitler"
This is strange.
I heard a lot of nothing.
"We're not entirely sure what it was but I see read '10% for the big guy' before launching my missile."  - Pilot
The US always likes to point finger real quick. We know it's Project Blue Beam. The US wants to blame China to start war.
ITS ALIEN'S , ITS OUT COME ON NOW !!!!
its an alien ship... its time for independence day
How many fitgh
What confuses me is why Biden and Trudeau are being so public about it? If it's espionage or an extra terrestrial craft, they could have just said nothing...why the sudden 'transparency'? Do they know a lot more than they're saying and they're drip feeding info to let people get used to the idea of some type of major contact in progress???
Jim Alcosta.... I thought he was all washed up... he was never able to get Kayleigh McEnany flustered with his lies.  She'd always fire back with truth from actual media articles.  I guess all Jimbo can do now is report on meaningless balloons.  These are probably balloons HUNTER released in order to distract the public.
some pilots said it messes with censors others said their censors were not effected. the news stated they were flying "F-22 Raptors" here are the capabilities of that fighter jet . they know exactly what it looked like and it was not a small flying car https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVOk0SXCW_s
Frozen water?  We call that ice, you idiots.
Balloons fools
Origin and motive?    CRICKETS
Sounds crazy iknow but all the secrets and no pics/vids seems abit wierd buuut, If u goddamn cowboys have managed to shoot down something alien in nature, very fxxxxxg good job. Surely no reason to worry, we are offcourse far superiour to any stupid intergalactic civilization 😂
Great, we pissed off China last week and this week Aliens Lol.
ok great...lets be told what it is....some images, anything
Listen. The Ballon was a cover. These are real UAPs. The kind that the government made a report about . The first balloon blown up in the news was either to analyze the ufos that  came into our atmosphere. Or. It was flooded in the news cycle so people.had "balloon" on their brains when the real UFOs are apprehended. Don't be fooled people
.....annnnndddd it begins
It was a UFO.
CANCEL CNN
Omg!! I think that’s my dam piscucha vos! Ya la cagué majes jerotes!  No es mi culpa, la mierda esa es marca china por eso vuela solo por esos aires!! So dnt be blaming me after all, it’s in its nature.
I'll save y'all some time. Pilots involved reported differing experiences as has been reported, and re-reported. Nothing new here. 4-1/2 minutes saved to watch another cat video or something.
Who ever is testing our airspace is definitely succeeding rn
Well atleast they acted quicker this time instead of sitting there with their thumbs up their bums for days like they did with the balloon. It’s funny how police in America can pop someone without hesitating if they deem them a threat. But if another country flies something that’s a threat to our airspace and national security they have to wait for a go ahead from our slow sleepy president who has to be told what to do instead of acting decisively like a man.
Nice that US pilots are allowed to comment on a classified incident. If something is to good to be true it usually is.  This report is CNN clickbait.
This is some top-notch psyops by the U.S.A. I'll believe it when I see it. Just an excuse to activate NORAD without spooking the markets about ww3.
Those expensive planes have no capability to record by video? we should not have to rely on what they saw, we should be able to replay a video recording.
i keep hearing the x-files theme music playing
What if we done blew up ET cause China can't spy like a normal nation, sending balloons out here like it's the 1800s.
We've got a modern Area 51 weather balloon incident here.  Either the objects shot down are Chinese/Russian and the USA doesn't want accidently start a war by jumping the gun OR we have something of greater proportions and these balloons are just the "excuse" needed to cover up what is really going on.  I'm not saying they are UFOs, there's already plenty of that nonsense on youtube.  I'd say it's more akin to the USA shooting down a foreign missile or aircraft and not wanting to tell the public about it.
Government so fake thy knows what it is .,
THIS IS FAKE NEWS --THE US MILITARY WILL NOT SHOOT AT SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT IDENTIFIED
Next year they'll be doing an investigation to determine why Biden and the Democrats sent up the balloons So he can get credit for his fast response since he screwed up on the first balloon.  The other possibility is a country of such as Russia or some other country wants us to have additional conflict with China. Example Russia would not want us to get along with China.
what if the balloon was a decoy so that it can prep folks into believing that it all war rumors or whatever tf but these UFO's escaped or are coming into earth just a gnarly theory idk LMAO
Now a fourth over Lake Huron in Michigan, why is our Pretender and Chief the Potato Biden not making a public address??? This is unreal!
An escaped Macy day parade float, or I`ll bet it was one of those blow up bouncy Carnival rides, hope there were no kids in it. I`m surprised they haven't went after the moon.
I don’t know what’s more unbelievable, the UFOs or the fact crybaby Acosta still has a show.
WWIII has begun. Activate all reserves and national guard. All standing military in highest level of alert. Initiate emergency wartime conscription plans. Begin massive production of munitions and weapons.
Some reports said the F16s fired Sidewinders in one of the instances. If I am not mistaken, those are heat seeking missiles. But apparently these objects didnt  have any "heat" emitting propulsion right  (heat=infrared) ?
Conditioning
THEY AE COMING... STAY ALLERT.. THIS YEAR WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR HUGE ANSWERS IN EVERY MYSTERIOUS STAGE OF HUMANITY
An aliens kid stole a small ship from the mother' ship and didn't really know how to drive it.   We just killed it and now declared war
3years ago!    Gas $2.a gallon-eggs$1 a dozen-mortgage rates 3%-inflation 1%-full employment-economic growth-world peace!       What happened???????????????????????
He just said 5 balloons
4 now under Bidens watch ! America is in deep shite china is winning the war! :(
Aliens
The government N the people better hope that Alien friends and family dont come looking for  the UFO cause some one have to pay for the stupid things that they have done when they ask to pay for dmg and hope that the alien dont start a war on planet earth.
This is Russian disinformation people
biden is the worst president in U.S. history
Watch for contrived UFO encounter ...........Remember this post.......... Deep fake narrative  (Alien encounter) Governments doing what they do best DECEPTION
Let's Go Brandon 👽
🛸
Pure speculation
Pure speculation
What the hell..... cylindrical, hexagonal, rectangular....what is going on here?  China sending US a Tetris puzzle.
The direction it came from ? UP....
must have fallen from an Australian mining truck.
They’re all trying soooo hard to not say UFO 🤣🤣🤣
As I’m listening to this I think that our forces are picking a fight with aliens and I’m sure they don’t want to talk about that but it should be brought up that these UFOs 🛸 didn’t do anything towards the U.S. or Canada to be shot down. I think there’s going to be some retaliation and it’s not going to be nice.
The US spends hundreds of thousands of dollars training these pilots who need to have perfect vision. They are trained observers and suddenly they can't describe something they're shooting down? Something is a bit fishy....
Did they shoot down the tic-tac?
Just a bit of logic to anyone in the comments: If these were aliens, they wouldn't be so easy to shot down. Probably some billionaire new drone toy or Musk's new PR stunt.
mysterious object might be  UFO 2.0
They are just getting you used to being told and seeing about UFOS but not being given any actual information.
Pilots must have video or pictures. military relies on " pilots accounts"..........not even in the 1940s.
There has to be video from the air. Show that and it will erase doubt
Timing is hella convenient. Now all of a sudden they wanna shoot 🛸 👽.  They are trying to do something or hide something!
We know what happened around Roswell in 1947 this government is still in denial
The main goal of CCP is to control the military and rule the people. suggesting CCP is not in control of the military shows how much you don't know about China..
Anyone hear about a Sasquatch bailing out of the one over Canada?
aliens? (Johnny harries video XD)
LYING LIARS AND THE LIES THEY LIE! Don't believe a word they say. I'm not pretending to know what it is, but I do know that a major deception of some sort is going on here.
It was a first Contact by aliens and now they are really pissed off
Men in Black: "Don't worry it's just another weather balloon"🤣
R these the tiktak U.a.p. we've been seeing hearing about finally shutdown with new aircraft upgrades.
A $124million dollar fighter jet doesn't have a camera on it. Where's the transparency.
is that lindsay lohan.?
Fee mysteriously locked up.  Hmm, I wonder if it's space men or space people?
The Alien Alliance is here
So we think it's smart to shoot at aliens with tech way better than us? I hope we all get conquered and enslaved. It's what humans deserve
This UAP nonsense is just a coverup for something bigger
First Contact ... with the Chinese.
I'm thinking that the Chinese are pulling a "Chicken Little, the Sky is Falling" scenario on us.  An acorn inspired panic amongst the population.
Let’s talk about these black projects that gave been going in over several decades.
Orbs. That's why they saw different things
cnn have a weak president this is a national disgrace to the United States of America and the world.
Doesn't a billion dollar plane have hi Def cameras?
All these UFO and Chinese Spying talks is to divert the currently talking about the  ' Most Talk About the actions of International Terrorist on Nord Stream Gas Pipeline'. Is lucky that only 10 % of the population in Europe and North America had the capability of those Rocket Scientist.
False flag, project blue beam, etc..
CNN you are liars and your content is a joke
Jim Acosta prefect story full of s--t reported buy the biggest  bag of talking S--t
All bs.
Breaking news: Congressman George Santos reveals himself as the pilot that took down the unknown object.
China virus leaked early b4 they were ready to send it via balloons to us.
I FREAKING TOLD YOU IS THE GODDAM ALIENS
Meanwhile, Joe Biden, the sellout whose family has been paid off by communist China continues to appease China.
UFO watching us human
Pilots lost time, most likely.
JFC this guy is still "reporting". J.A. is Fake News.
I'm still waiting for the Russian collusion from you guys at Clinton news network
Shit about to hit the fan prepare your mental for what's about to happen and have faith
If the f.b.i. heads this investigation we will never nothing about it
Were they F-35s or F-22s that shot it down?
Time to see videos or pictures of the ufo's
Excellent job making it sound like the US doesn’t have a clue. Clearly, the current administration is happy to let an idiot copy off their test answers.
Too much information so it sounds like 🐂. Anything given to Acosta to spew is subterfuge.
Satellite balloon.  tons of videos of these. Just not on here of course.
If a drone can fly that high I would send a military drone up there and try to tow it back to the ground then there wouldn't be so much confusion.
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT .( UFO ) I'll go out on a lym.
CNN (Certainly Not News)
Yo so uh amazing cool UFO’s and stuff, wow. But how about we get some coverage of the Ohio version of Chernobyl that’s happening right now? You know, train with deadly chemicals derailed and it’s been burning for days, releasing vinyl chloride and other chemicals into the air, water and ground… I know they already gave the evacuated people 5 dollars as compensation, but. Vinyl chloride causes cancer, you know? There’s rivers full of dead fish and farmers that have reported dead livestock. Might be interesting to cover that as well right?
China's in Party City mode.
The FBI is involved now, good luck with any truth surfacing anytime soon.
It's sky trash. Come on folks, you know we trash the crap out of the lands, ocean, space etc...
It probably was swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and reflected the light from Venus.
Great, in two weeks we've shot down a weather balloon and a UFO.  One more take down and they could work for the Uvalde police department.
if they have shot down santa claus,i will be deeply upset !
There's a pattern of UFO sightings and wars.
an all U.S. investors enter any China stock markets to support evil CCP stock markets. Ban all China app(tiktok) now. Ban all China CCP pay (Ali pay, Wechat pay, Union pay) using U.S. pay system. Ban all China CCP members and family enter U.S. forever base on UN human right report stated that China CCP group are meet crime against of human right in XiJiang,
THEY SHOT A FUCKING DRAGON
Why is the Biden administration not telling us the truth about these UFOs?
Total bs. Do they really think we’re that gullible?
Sounds like a non-existing "ghost-ufo", a spooky fata morgana in the air?! :-)😂
It can't be aliens because we have systems that track whole meteorites so if they were aliens we would have known days ago. There's something going on between governments.
Slowly dispersing variants into the atmosphere is my guess
It's freaking 2023, don't these fighter jets have something like a camera that has a tracking feature that can zoom in to their targets and take a photo??
All the accounts of UFO infractions over US air space and all of a sudden they're shooting shyt down? What changed? Why now? Why are they sharing so much info too? It's all very suspect to me. It will be interesting to see how this all plays out. For those making ignorant a$$ comments about UFOs, really need to educate themselves before talking shyt. Making fun of the subject just makes you look uninformed and ridiculous.
That's interesting 🤔  I think I saw one a few years ago in Mo. And it really did look like something out of the X Files.  It never made a sound.
Where are the pictures? They must of took photos. They tell lie after lie to confuse us on purpose great excuse to spend your tax on surveilance to spy on american people in the name of ufo's.
(sigh)  🛸👾👽
Uap
FBI calling FOX MAULDER.. We NEED YOU TO LOOK AT THIS SHIT!
Everytime they are being shot Down, Some kind of virus is Burst in the air from the Balloons.
The consequent objects after the weather balloon seem to be probes and from whom? We are not alone.
Party favors. Whoopee cushions in the sky.
THEIR NOT RELEASING ANYTHING BECAUSE IT DID NOT HAPPEN.  THE U.S IS TRYING TO SAVE THEIR FACE OVER THE BALLOON.  BY FAKING A OBJECT AND THEY SHOT DOWN.  AFTER THE U.S FAILED TWO ATTEMPTS OVER A SLOW BALLOON AND HIT IT IN THE THIRD ATTEMPT.  THIS IS NOTHING BUT A FACE SAVING EVENT.
Don't know what it is but you Shoot Them down without question what happens win they shoot back???
Acosta are you getting canned?
2:16 🤭 “Alright Natasha, thank you very much 👋” 😆
AMERICA IS PARANOID NOW. THEY KNOW THEIR END IS GETTING NEAR.
Senile Joe Biden, started War of the Worlds , blew up the Nordstream 2 pipeline now this ,
The first two weather balloons laid down in Canada belong to NOAA 😡Because there were two weather balloon signals on the weather website, and they disappeared at the same time.
DEAR ALL OF THIA SO CALLED PLANET EARTH MR PRESEDENT PUTIN WILL DESTEOY THE UNITED STEATES OF AMERICA NO ONE HAS YET TO VISION RUSSIA FAIR WEL STAY WELL BE WELL THANK YOU
Screw the government, I wanna make friends with aliens. Lol  Come on in otherworldly dudes.
Biden: I regret to inform Americans that Alaska no longer exists after an Unidentified Object destroyed almost all of Alaska.
There here ............
USA was planning meetings with China. Then all this happened. Meetings canceled. Could be Russia did not want these meetings, in case US and China decided to work together. Russia wanted no meetings between USand China. Wanted to make sure China stayed with them.
garbage
They can literally come up with anything. CNN is the king of fake news. Prove me wrong.
China first infected us with the deadly virus and now with spy balloons popping up everywhere. But first, they infected us with Chinese spies/students on ground. Let's not forget this.  They could be a real, present threat from within.
~~~~~Raelian Embassy ~~~~~
Aliens 👽
Great we killed 👽
I am wondering here, when a pilot aproaches the object they are supposed to shoot down can they take a good high resolution photograph while is hoovering in the air? At least this could clarify some of the conflicting reports from pilots. A military jet can have a high resolution camera in the cockpit as it flies towards the object, then later on shoot it down.
"Something's going on / And you don't know what it is / Do you, Mister Jones ........"
The speed of the f35 has nothing to do with its radar systems lol.
No one belives à dam thing that comes from CNN
Flying saucers are always a great distraction
The man on the street wants photos. Photos or it didn't happen. Still waiting for photos (or video) of the commercial jet aircraft crashing into the pentagon on 9/11. You thought he had forgotten?
Fake news, F-22s have cameras and the object was only at 40,000 ft And the F-22 would know exactly where the debris had fallen Marking the spot with GPS laser
How the hell they do not know what it is if they have some debries? Give me a fucking break, they would know right away. They obviously know whats goin on but they are feeding us nuggets to get us used or to slowly accept what is coming next. Get used to the situation with China becoming wierder and wierder.
gg
The FBI is on the case. I thought that FBI stood for "FOREVER BOTHERING ITALIANS".  DEFUND THE FBI!!!
We have a Pathetic, Weak and bought off President and Cabinet....This is the result of worrying about gender instead of the predators in the world.....
https://youtu.be/PlyxxAZIwds how to go to heaven  Church
They’re going to blame ISIS and Al qeada, they are the best scapegoats for Americas problems.
They are distracting us w this y
We need Agent Mulder and Scully on this one, ASAP!
This is more of propaganda from North America gov. CNN sure would push the fake news
B.S Cover up cover up
CNN AS USUAL MANIPULATING PEOPLE
It's probably one of my sister's biscuits that escaped from the oven and flew away.  Whatever you do, don't eat!!!
"We come in pieces..."
We need to increase our vigilance concerning Russian and Chinese spies entering our country- trying to find out how to shut down critical infrastructure.
Not trust not one.
Given how badly some military pilots misidentify things (take a look at all those "ufo" sightings that turn to be birds, IR flares from engines, and simple reflections) I'm not at all surprised that there are conflicting reports.
So manufactured and theatrical.....
It will be quite embarrassing for Amazon, when the news gets out that they have been testing their latest delivery drones for remote regions and scared the crap out of the US and Canada.
Maybe these things came with some sort of virus and people thinks it just a balloon who ever build these kind of objects are smart and maybe they will use these kind of weapon to destroy any countries but this time it's just to test if it works but next time always be careful it might come with a weapon inside and I was thinking maybe they don't use war airplane again but they used these kind of weapon no sounds and no radar to destroy any countries these things people must be aware of because we never know they might attack at night while people sleep I wonder who built these stuff.🤔
Remember this as a solid.  Anything you hear or see on CNN is a lie or at minimum gaslighting.
Maybe there's a new sci-fi film coming out and this is a grand advert?
So everybody has a phone with a camera but no one that lived I the area caught any footage??
Its all political fbi crooks working for Biden
So the US has just lunched an intergalactic war with the aliens?
Funny,  we can see a gnat smiling on a Horses ass from space, but don't ever get the pics we need to see. I know that they exist and can tell you that many kinds are here. I've seen the Tic tac up close within 40 ft. Actually there were 5 of them. The gov has hidden this for too long.  Open up the albums and give us our rightful pics as tax payers.
CNN =CROOKS
Its not hard to understand that they are collecting military bases locations and movements for a future and possible military invasion.
Wait until they release the dragons under the earth
I bet if we go to Earth Nullschool and follow the jetstreams we'll see these "objects" show up next in Greenland or Iceland and then in Europe. Seems like someone spammed a bunch of balloons from Asia, maybe Russia.
Alien disclosure coming soon?
This is distraction, the FBI is taking the lead lol
jared and shannon leto are stalking someone and she need she help. i hope anyone will look into this matter.
What is going to happen when some terrorist or bad country decides to fill these balloons with a toxic chemical and then we shoot it down over us airspace and then this gas disperses?
These are tests of the West's air defence and detection capabilities, probably being run by the Chinese. There is no doubt that most Western NATO countries would have failed to detect these objects in their airspace, but the US and Canada are picking up a few of them. By doing this the Chinese will now better understand the weakest spots of the West's air defences, and thus the best routes to send jets or missiles through. This is likely to be part of the tactical work up to the invasion of Taiwan, which will probably happen very soon.
Started a war with aliens, we bout to get eliminated
Why don't just start a war with China. First send all WMD to Taiwan.
"no sense at all" well remember that what china says is far from their action look what they did in building an artificial island in spratly,first they say that it is a fisherman resting island or some sort of that but now look it's already a military facility.what i'm saying don't trust china
Was it an F-22, F-35, or an F-16? I've seen reports of all 3 🤣🤣🤣
Takeaways: No person is flying these objects. They are the size of cars. One was fast enough to get to Lake Huron. Hawaii Observatory noticed green lasers coming down from Space, identified as a Chinese observation satellite. United States has already used Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to go after others on the other side of the globe. You will need a satellite unless you have someone on the ground to fly the UAV.  The Lake Huron UFO is troubling. There is no population density on the north shores of the Great Lakes. This near-zero density extends all the way to the Arctic Ocean. The population density is higher on the West Coast and Southeast Canada. This makes an arrow to Lakes Superior and Nipigon.  China could only avoid detection from Alaska and Canada through another country: Russia. It would be more militaristic if the UFO/UAV were from Russia.
Sounds like Elon's Tesla reentered earth's atmosphere :))
This is just turning into a media hype/clickbait fest. A balloon might not have a discernible propulsion system. And you would question a balloon because some do and some don't so it is a question I'd expect to be asked and reported on.
I feel much safer knowing Biden was informed and involved.
Bullshit.
We know it's the aliens. Nothing to hide there.  They are coming to end us all since our technology is advancing and we pose a threat to them now unless they are coming to show us what real tech is controlling an unmaned object from cybertron
China AND Russia are testing out our (U.S.A.) airspace security- protocols, military reaction/responses, timing... War strategizing?  Putin already 'threatened' "The West" multiple times the past year, if The West doesn't stay out of Putin's War with Ukraine. Napoleon Complex.  I'd rather meet E.T. 🙃  Wasn't N. Korea also testing awfully close a month +/- ago?
Spy balloon my ass ..
Not saying it was aliens but it’s aliens
Sounds like a classic UFO story, 'conflicting accounts'. Which is why they get dismissed as subjective/hallucination/self hypnosis etc etc. So maybe it's a real classic UFO they shot and it will change shape in the laboratory and then suddenly disappear.....
Yup so fascinatingly scary for everyone in America!
What a PsyOp.  The beginning of Project Blue Beam?  A distraction for the parasitic globalist goons bringing down our financial system to impose digital currency AND digital control. They want you all skeerd so you’re more easily controlled
I wasn’t aware that ballon’s require a “ propulsion system “
I'm telling you, If it was a silver looking guy on a surf board we're all screwed. 🫣
MASS BULLSHITTING !
Will smith where are you? 😂
Hey, it's the guy from Hunting Hitler in the History Channel
At the beginning they send probes ......the real attack will be in three days ....about 15 or 16 Feb. Be ready people
Oh great more lies from the fbi
When she said “another spy balloon” she gave it away, immediately changed the way she described it and laughed… smoke screen! Another circus to charge us more taxes
@CNNare you aware of the ufo they got over Montana and Hauled it out on tractor trailer.. yesterday.  Look into it  .
I have a big catalog of all un-identify objects, if you sent me some pictures, I will tell you what it is, who own it and where it came from.
When should all Chinese nationals should be asked politely to leave the US?
Maybe alll Chinese embassies should be closed and sent home.
Frozen water is ice lmao
Where are the men in black when are needed
in june first contact will be made they will say were are our probes
now UFO'S hey , what a joke, you cant believe anything these people in our govt say any more,. so sad if we ever do get invaded who will believe these twits , shameful, why would this guy say 5 balloons came over the U.S.A total biased against the last administration, so 3 yrs later they saw these balloons over on Trumps watch , gesus this is a joke
China doesnt care about plane lives? Or covid?
These sound like false flags to me to make people fear for "national security" and "the homeland". Instill fear, destract from actual things that matter, and manufacture consent for more military spending and more war
Last summer when there was the hearing in Congress about UAPs and the Navy acknowledged all the navy footage of the "tick tac" objects flying near warships of of San Diego...and the US didnt shoot at those objects . Yet they are shooring at slow moving objects now in the last few days? Seems odd
Is China related yes or no?, If not, are these objects considered extraterrestrial?
Holy Moses! They are gonna have to disclose.
The US needs to be more vigilant and pay better attention to air and sea. I remember seeing a weird object similar to what they’re describing hovering very low and moving slowly over the sea and making a weird noise. Some people said it was alien but my gut is telling me it’s a test air craft of some kind from a foreign country. Time to shore up spying capabilities to ascertain exactly what other countries not too friendly to us are up to
99 red balloons 🎈🎈  and now we are the war machine opening it's eye ..  sad day of chicken little..
We have the ability to know if it was communicating.
So it's a secret until the Media/govt decide they want to tell us?
Has anybody checked up on Santa?
Danceing around useing the correct term UnIdentifed flying object
As China becomes increasingly stronger, this is just further slow, steady encroachment, like the Blob, to take eventual control of its ec enemy U. S., and the world?
Seems kind of funny how nobody on the ground have seen anything odd in the sky anywhere , something fishy is going on the government and news media all must be messing with people to see if they can cause mayhem.
Lake Huron object is  (OCTAGONAL) structure with strings hanging off but no discernable payload. Official said there is no indication of surveillance capability but can't rule it out  First a CYLINDRICAL shaped UAP/ UFO object;  now a OCTAGONAL shaped object?   Are these All BALLOONS ???  What kind of Balloons are Shaped like a CYLINDER  and a OCTAGON ?  There is something very STRANGE going on in the Skies now !
If they shot down anything, it was something they released.this is propaganda
Pilots don’t talk .. Fake news
What they do to us to deserve to get shot down? 😆
So planes don't have cameras?????? Gtfooh
40k feet is too high for something without wings or huge balloon
Don't even know where it came from but let's blame China lmao are use ok lol
Some say it looked like Nixon or the Virgin Mary...but smells like Elon Musk mischievous.
I have to be from Artificial Intelligence from our planet I seriously doubt our president shooting down a craft that he thought was from outer space alien race was there was some kind of viable threat I'd still try to make nonviolent contact with them I'll bet you anything races Advanced Asian technology and the artificial intelligence came up with it
Aliens!!!!
It was Bill Gates new flying toy. Thanks so much for shooting it down. Just saying for a friend.
We are making it known that Martians are not welcomed here.
99% fake propaganda. If this is mysterious, then why spread the news to public? Your intelligent agency should assess it first!
LET'S GO AMERICA THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED FEAR SO WE CAN DO ANYTHING WE WANT TO ANYBODY!
WowwWWWW NOT EVEN THE PILOTS HAD A CAMERA LMAOOOOO this is a lie
How was there "obviously a propulsion system"? Some crafts drift without propulsion. This guy is just making stuff up which is perfect for the media who love to invent drama
America are under by evil China CCP system attacked. U.S. need strong action now. Ban all U.S. funds going to any China stock markets. Ban all U.S. investors enter any China stock markets. Ban all China app running in U,S. Ban all China CCP members adn family enter to U.S. Ban all China CCP agents and followers any activity in U.S. Ban all China international over age students apply VISA(most of them are using fake students I.D. to cover up their spy. Any oversea students(agents of CCP) activity will be ban to enter  U.S. forever. Increasing all made in China high tech goods custom duty. Lower and duty free made in Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Korea and Japan to helping all high tech chain moving out from China CCP control. U.S. need made a first step for 1000% sure right now. UN human right council report already proved China CCP group in XiJiang area meet the crime of against of human right.
It's space junk on the rampage, it's out to get us.
The blue book just turn purple ?
https://youtu.be/uH7If_aBZKA
This better be aliens, because I can't stand another election cycle so soon after 2020.   "War, huh!  What is it good for?  Helping us ignore our domestic problems in favor of boosting military production! Huh!"
Galileo from ncc-1701 ?
Pilots would not say what they encountered
I hope it’s aliens
It’s an alien craft. Come on , they know what it is. Stalling to formulate a lie
It’s all fake except for the first one they made up the other stories to make Biden look like he knows what he’s doing
If it is an Alien life form then I volunteer to go!
Baer talked without saying anything.
its the govt preparing us for UFOs
They’re flying by at Mach 1, my wife doesn’t even see me driving in town
It's Deez 🌰🌰z🤣🛸
At least the cover story of its just a weather balloon will be more believable this time, unlike roswell lol 🤷‍♂️
and thus now the Chinese can hear what the Pilots experienced/saw and can work from there.....I'm pretty sure it's not that smart to be allowing interviews with your counter intelligence! Crazy! I hope the West has figured out that The East is all working together in an attempt to spread our defences thin with territorial threat invasions of the West's allies. And now the East is having a look at where our forces are. Time to start storing the beans and rice and water.
Crazy days
The military hasn’t released this information have they?How in the hell does CNN know any of this?
Damn this is how we are going out? I thought I’d at least see sixty years of life.
I guess ufo and cie going to be the new way to take control be cause covid doest work any more ....
China 🇨🇳 Joe Biden was shooting at Ironman
Could be a decoy, a distraction.
People aren’t saying it,   But as close to Russia as they have been,    Are these Russian in combination with China       Missiles, or aircraft
Wth. So this is implying they shot down a ufo ?
Am I right
So much different story about the object! fake !!!!
China cannot afford nukes to destroy us, but balloons drifting along hardly get noticed.
He said he encountered an object go at Mach 6???  We don't have any known power plants that can generate Mach 6 that are manned.  Not sure if we have unmanned vehicles that have that ability.
People should believe the pilots.
here goes the government trying to start an inter-galactic conflict lmfao
preety sure an chinese spy baloon but whos knows XDXD
Could it be a dragon? Clearly no propulsion system and can fly at that altitude.
is it space junk??
#Aliens‼️
👁️🔺
Too bad we won't know the truth in our lifetime, or our children's lifetimes, or their children's lifetimes, or their children's children's lifetimes, or their children's children's children's lifetimes. And so on and so forth. Good distraction from our economic and "down to Earth issues" we have to deal with everyday....
It was carrying a fresh load of "love letters" from Kim (N. Korea) to Trump.
Shooting down any of the four horsemen of the apocalypse can’t be good !!!
Serves the extraterrestrials right for sending a peace envoy in a vehicle no one recognizes.
👽
Who knows. Believe what you want.
The pilots are flying extremely fast of course it’s very difficult to give an accurate description
Alaska has frozen water?  Thanks for the great news! ;) BTW, has anyone seen my drone lately?
Dropping from outer space?
BE AFRAID BE VERY AFRAID, NAME UFO, BE AFRAID.
Bio chemical spread Everytime they shot one.bring down slowly "OR burn it up before hit ground.
It's a weather baloon...
This is what happens when you have a weak administration.
Jesus Christ, typical government bullshit.  Im beginning to think our government is almost as inept as Russia's.   The latest one was shot down at 30,000. Can we get a private pilot with a twin engine Cessna, go up, take out your iphone, and snap a high resolution picture.  Do what our government cant seem to get done.  I mean WTF?
Maybe the Ballons are false flags to cover up the beginning of the War of the World's..
sounds like Roswell.
Divide and conquer is their plan and it's working.  Reagan said we have bigger problems than each other. Bible says the enemy is not of flesh and blood?
What's the fuss with those balloons? For example: Those were deployed since the 80's in Libanon also. And they were shot down as soon as they were detected. From my opinion: shoot down every unidentified object that's moving around above your territory.
We are on the brink of being a type 1 society. We have now controlled nuclear fusion and computational singularity is within reach. It's time for "them" to show their faces.
Our government is trying to depopulate us😡
One of my theories is that these cylinders if they are actually just that are full of something mabey pods.
F22s can do a super stall (virtually stopped in mid flight)  So the excuse of speed is not usable.
We have been watched by aliens for as long as we have been around, but at $400k dollar a missile, it has been cheaper to just leave them up there  Thank you China for sending a balloon and starting all this
Naw Bob. It's sound like we need to stop fighting each other and worry about whts coming up out of our waters and whts froming down from our skies. Maybe thts wht China was following.  We all bouts ta die. God is angry
So, this is our Analyst!!!!!
Roswell
The aliens will corral us, like we do sheep, cattle etc, and then send us through their food processing line. Some aliens like to dip humans whole in a boiling liquid for a few seconds and then eat us while we are still alive and screaming.
I honestly think they might have shot down an ET UFO thinking that it was another Chinese Balloon. Things are about to get very scary in the next couple of days. Welcome to the new reality!
WW3 might be with aliens.
Definitely ufo 🛸
They are lying they are not being truthful to the general public.
If they shot down a 'Tic Tac' like UAP then that would be very interesting. My money is on a huge Psy Ops as they American economy and society circles the drain.
The ballon is a charging station for the vehicle!!  It’s the mother ship i betcha!!!’ Whoooo eeeeeee
Ohhhhh they have information they aren’t sharing it.
Oh nooooo aajother Roswell but who the hell is going to open a UFO shop up there in the cold
Roswell incident version 2.0?
You know,if I were an alien military strategist,I would send unmanned scouting machines to test my opponents defensive reactions before I launched the main invasion.😨on the other hand this could all be just a distraction to keep people's focus away from something our governments are up to.🤔either way we are probably screwed 😒
Fake news Jim Acosta is still around?
Why would anyone believe CNNs point of view
We shot down a foo fighter !!! Invasion earth 🌏 2023
This is looking like this: Operation Fortitude
americans are going balloonistic!!!  america spying on a lot of countries almost everyday and you are crying about being spied on.  Get used to it.  What you can do to others they can also do to you. The government is using this opportunity to brain wash their own american people once more, to make people hate on China.
Does anybody really believe of what you are saying ?   Does it make any difference for anything !
tested new tactics china beware object now
👽 not  🎈
IF it is an alien object, they have shit avoidance protocols! could this be one of the Jewish space lasers that the Genius warned us about?? Just asking!!!!
So they don’t know nothing about this object…. But they shut it down anyways!?!?!?! Seriously ?  Why ?
Pure absolute Garbage!  Believe nothing CNN reports!  A fake alien invasion was planned well in advanced!  Everyone who didnt take the Vax knows this!  We all know how to read and we saw the release!  Don't fall for it!  CNN is CIA funded!  Believe nothing they say!!!
May be if its Alians there coming to get  small guy and help the poor midfle class and let the multy million airs billion air and all the robbers of Hoverment let to all distroy themselves how great would that be
Reality is, your not going to get a truthful answer from anyone that knows  what they saw.  First thing they should say above all  is if any of the debris  is from this planet.  That's all you need to know to make up your own mind without all of the bs  these people feed to the public.  If any of you believe anything at all in the media or from what we are told when our nation is addressed from our leaders, you just keep the wool over your eyes while the rest of us look with our actually eyes at what we know we are seeing.  Disinformation and doubt is a very suitable tool used on people to get the reactions and outcomes they are looking for.  Manipulation is easily achieved when you record the history of all events and how the public reacted.  Pull the strings and you will all follow suit.  Simple, and sad.
He had a message in the ballon, it's say: You gone have a lucky year in money and love...
Why hasn't anyone made claim to the two UFOs. They just saw their investment get destroyed
If CNN is reporting it, you KNOW it's fake!  Project BlueBeam!
Cylinder shape does not sound like a balloon, although I know that Google had cylindrical communications balloons at one point.
Wakanda gonna be pissed if they keep shooting this stuff down.
The Chinese bots in the comment section makes me believe this was China.
Folks, stop leaving plastic trash out. The big sheets of plastic can be easily picked up by the wind and now we have to use F35’s to pick up your trash! 😏
China has a lot of bad luck, 5 weather balloons going rogue
JRE will be all over this soon
They should have the air force or maybe multiple agencies study this material, certainly not the FBI alone.
Can't the real president Obama or George Soros ask Joe to ask his masters in the CCP to stop flying their spy balloons over our nuclear sites?  I am sure the CCP just laughs at all of them like the rest of us.  I wonder if the CCP wants to buy CNN like Russia does?
It’s probably those WeChat users.
Santa Claus returning from six weeks of post-Christmas sun in the tropics(just kidding)
Like the Pelosi footage , will be 2-4 weeks before you see something  , I would bet ya 50
Stop killing ufos
They shot down the Chinese balloon over water because it could have been full of anthrax.
We killed ET!!!! Transtellaar!!!!
Spies all over this Country, could even be sitting right next to one at work.      The gentleman asks, “ Why are the Chinese doing this?”  Perhaps it’s to verify the information Tr 🤡💩 p  sold them in our Top Secret documents.  Before they pay up, they want to make sure the info is accurate.
Stock up on ammunition y’all we are at war they need to do like Ukraine did and start passing out AK-47s to everybody
OMG!  WE SHOT DOWN A UFO!
hot take: the chinese 'balloons' were just the guidance/triangulation systems for this experimental antigravity drone tech and with the balloons outta commission it was lost
I hope it not the Aliens... their gonna be pissed.
Now ask yourself, why do they want so badly to push a War with China and or Russia. Stop drinking the propaganda and start thinking for yourself. War is not for the security amd safety of the American people, NEVER HAS BEEN.
Maybe these are all a distraction from something else that’s going on.  Don’t look here. Look over there.
Let's not forget Korean Air Flight 007 shot down by trigger happy Russians .. there are lots of commercial polar flights that could be mistaken for "unidentified cylindrical objects".
Take me to your leader
Rather than blow them up, can they bring them down/land them intact to get a better look?
There was just another one shot down over Lake Huron
Strange how we have satellites in space that can see a dime on the ground but we cant get an image of this flying object? What is the govt hiding from us?
Maybe 👽  can  help us save our poor planet👋✌️
Extra-terrestrial stupid !
So just to be as clear as possible. Pilots know EXACTLY wtf a balloon is. And now with ANOTHER object over lake michigan that a commercial pilot said "was a long cylindrical object moving at high speeds went right over head". And they said "they've made contact with the object over michigan".
It's the aliens checking out syria/ turkey earthquake..  they've been coming all throughout history at sites affected by natural calamities .
He is making way too many assumptions, which leads me to believe this is nothing but a false flag. Like I said, keep your trap shut until things are proved. I hate the so-called experts spouting their crap all over social media pretending they know the narrative. That means they're already trying to paint a narrative prior to even knowing what it is; that is highly suspicious.
Gotta get the public on board to start more wars.
Ask the pilots about Hunters lap top.  That way we don't have to have the typical op ed piece CNN calls news.  As usual the media has no coverage of the devices in the air in real time, told not to likely.
Have the Chinese got spy satellites in space? Surely they have. Why use balloons?
eye witness are notorious unreliable.... surely cameras and digital image capture would be more reliable than pilots spotting what they can see with their eyes
WAG the DOG.
What I'm confused about is how come it's not noticed until its over the area it definitely shouldn't be over till the last minute
they shot down a tic-tac!
There is no proof yet, other than the first object, that these are Chinese. If you're really an expert, you'd keep your trap shut about things not proved.
Clearly you already got the inside on what they were covered because he comes straight out and says there’s no identifiable surveillance systems on board on board of what when you say I’m bored that’s usually referring to a ship isn’t it
Now this is the most trusted guy in news...really I mean it... I'm not joking 😂😂😂😂
Leave us not forget North Korea.  After all Kim Jong-un could easily generate enough hot air for high altitude balloon.
That one old guy, from wherever. He was a great distraction from what was being discussed. He changed it to that weather balloon again. That wasn't what was being discussed. It was that new object with no visible production and what it looked like to those different pilots. It's almost like he was put on TV to distract from that fact. And to throw off any good journalism questions (like there are any good journalists left that don't just say what they are told they can ask.)
For you threat deniers: Balloons can carry EMP equipment.
UFOs! So cool!
Regardless of foreign intentions, ours ought to be very clear. We are not without answers to the American people and a clear message to the originator.
Or they are UAPs How about we get some identification of the objects before we start blaming Russia and China
This is truly scary. Steven Hawkins made a  foreboding statement. These “aliens” are so much more intelligent than us, they will obliviate us
It looked like a balloon made in china & was allowed to enter US airspace by biden . Our military under disgraceful treasonous general miley cirus warned china earlier in the day that it would be shot down to give biden cover for being such a total f***up on the fake cnn news
As if the USA military is going to tell the world what is going on, get real the media does not run the military
CNN fake af
We all know what happened in 1945 when the government got involved in “mysterious events” in Roswell New Mexico… they claimed ballon
It now is starting to make sense that the original Chinese balloon was tracking ufo activity in the far north and was blown south. Biden knew it wasn't a spy balloon and that's why it wasn't shot down straight away. Because Trudeau has come out saying the Canadians "shot down a cylindrical object" - this has blown the cover on the ufo cover up. Very interesting.
The important thing is that we all keep our wits about us while also being open minded.  I mean, you don't want to be played like we have before, but you don't really want to go off the deep end with conspiracy either.  Get evidence and follow it to the most likely conclusion.
Save yourself the effort; they've just spent 6 minutes speculating and saying they don't know.
"It appears to be a snow sleigh with a overweight white male with white hair and a beard in his 60s in a red suit with reindeer attached to the flying vehicle." Could have been from the North Pole
Is it possible that it is a device from another galaxy and there is no one who dares to mention that option?
Bout time the aliens showed up now we made em mad fun!  Or a balloon whatever man
LOL but cant help feeling that this was the Weasley brothers Ford Anglican from the Harry Potter books . 🤣
It was George Jetson and Jane his wife
We'll you remember the Roswell story..  it's a flying disc!  the next day..  No it was a weather balloon!?   hell we don't know? lol   They'd have been better off to just not say anything.
China Balloon was surveilling THIS UFO.   calling it right now.
Like many I want to know where's the photos the technology we have can read the date on a dime from a mile away .are we all that dumbed down  that there wasn't photos / video taken and the big  deal being make now when we are being told many of the these or similar have been confirmed over many years. What is really happening     Is Something going  That's not being reported on like the climate crisis that's never getting  reported on much when it's the biggest problem facing life on earth  right now and getting close or  has caused a tipping point and run away climate change puts everyone on earth at risk .
FBI sent Hunters laptop up in a balloon shaped object to have it shot down to destroy it
We are being probed, probably by Putin. Not good.
👽👾
This is totally drama just divert world tension from Turkey & Syria earthquake witches done by American technology.
I bet these are the same sort of objects the military has seen. They remarked that they couldn't figure out how it was propelled.
He said she said.  Can't believe anything on CNN anyways!
UFO.
Prepare for the fake alien invasion
I don't believe DOD would divulge any details of this object, maybe to let the sender know of destruction of it.
Might be Satan coming back for the evil heart and soul trump and the cult
Im having a hard time believing theyve actually gotten first hand accounts of what the object was yet as that absolutely is top secret clearance and it would be very easy to track down where that kind of leak came from.
If they can't identify what these things are, maybe they shouldn't be shooting them down? Gonna start an interstellar war ffs. Ground all flights & shut airports in the area down if there's a potential threat.
This is not good.
Fellas, it’s not Ufo, it’s just China basically saying “im the big brother and i got my eyes on you”.. Because NATO wants to expand in Asia and NATO’s Chief visited South Asia two weeks ago. China has been violating US airspace since then. They are no joke 😶
Did it look like the tic tac? Multiple accounts of a tic tac flying object. Specifically the recently declassified videos
It's time for Biden and his administration to go on a hot air balloon ride.
What if aliens are here by dumb luck and flying a hoopty that's barely running?  We shot it down! Damn the luck
Anti-gravity propulsion, like the tic tac. We just blew an ET out of the sky. So Reckless.
I remember this used to be the trump channel now its the ufo channel, anything to distract from your blunders . It will be great when it all comes down !
It had markings of Garfield the Fat Cat
After all their peaceful attempts to contact humans by floating balloons through the air were shot down, who could really blame the aliens when their next balloon is equipped with a death ray?!
..Cnn...there was nothing said that was of any value to the audience...
If this is extraterrestrial then I would be very disappointed. Coming across the universe to be shot down by a single missle. How anticlimactic
Surely the pilots would have taken images of the object ?
It's Putin trying to get us in a tangle with China, or North Korea
Anyone following the Joe Rogan podcast know what this is about. Half a dozen of reputed personalities have spoken on it. We don't know what it is but we know what it is.
Why are we now shooting all this stuff down,,when these are documented to be around flight operations all over the world,what's changed? Are we scared of objects with no armament, yes we are.
I'm here just for the various conspiracies. Favourite so far - aliens.  I'm going with North Korea pleasure balloons piloted by crab people.
FBI will never tell what it is.  It'll be listed as weather devise like at Roswell.
Aliens think we’re bums and are giving us supply drop care package’s
No X files lol ...maybe the pilots had just visited the weeds dormitory 😂😂😂
Oh, that was the giant Tic Tac they saw back in late 2004. Now they will get to eat it... LOL
Why is it impossible to infiltrate the Chinese circles? That doesn't make sense. It's a ruthless, corrupt, authoritarian regime - we can't find one guy to bribe?
Them things are feeding the Communist space station live feed russia & china have in space they are weaponizeing agianst U.S. and allies...
Real UFO????
People from the year 8099.
Ephesians 6:12
Save me a leg will ya. I heard them green guys are extra crispy with a cream filling.
Tic-Tac
China has got to be panicking if we discover some new technology they have developed.
Nancy Policy Tiwan Blinken China read between the lines
It's hilarious that they're trying to pass this off as some mysterious ufo, alluding to aliens, when it's clearly just another recon probe or offensive measure from the ccp. Instead of trying to pull the wool over our eyes maybe you should be preparing the country for war.
why shoot it down if no one knows what it is?
2023 clearly we gonna see aliens with our own eyes
Dont trust cnn...they are bidens minion....its all a distraction.
WELL IT COULD BE A WEALTHY TRUMP BACKER ALSO UPSET ABOUT BIDEN. PLANS TO COLLECT TAXES FROM THE WEALTHY ELITES THEY INCREASED PRICES TO DISCREDIT DEMOCRATS BUT MADE. BILLIONS IN PRIOR MONTHS REPUBLICANS PREVENTED BIDEN FROM INSTALLING NEEDED IRS AGENTS TO ADDRESS THE WEALTHY ELITES TAXES FRAUDS LIKE THE TRUMPS SKATING ON YEARS OF TAXES FRAUDS! YES WE HAVE PRIVATE CITIZEN GOING TO MOON SO WHO'S OWNS THESES BALLOONS!??
So many bad things happening on Earth that we actually hope for an alien invasion 🛸👽💢
What we want to know is it man made or from outer space.  That's much more concerning than if man made.
Another one just shot down over Lake Huron closer to big urban centres of US and Canada….wtf is going on? Just saw the tweet from Canadian defense minister
Can you get inside a door? Or do you go through it to another room?
Liars liars liars... Bastards shot down ET over bum$#& @laska - booo! Never even "described"  what they shot at. Who doesn't identify a target before executing a kill order - imagine the conversation where a higher up tells the pilot to shoot down a non hostile flying object!
With at least 3 instances of high altitude spy balloon fly overs during the trump administration that were not responded to perhaps trump's inaction allowed some of our foreign adversaries to believe the United States was incapable of a response. Thankfully the current administration under President Biden is changing that opinion. Since the first time the Black Bird spy plane flew it's high altitude flight ( 90,000 ft altitude) in 1963 America's CIA, NSA and DOD have kept an eye over the United States and it's foreign adversaries in a manner unmatched by by any other nation. Americans, as well as it's foreign adversaries would be wise to never underestimate US capabilities.
Playbook says, so it like Hollywood thriller. Flying objects all of sudden, COVID, Ukraine, Economy, Inflation, Deflation(balloon)...cancel all entertainment and enjoy the next 2 years of current government.
Clearly a ufo
This is as good as fake news
CNN full of lies.
Great…They killed the first visitors we’ve had from another star system 👍🏾 Seriously…..calm the hell down and report something when you actually have information.
They are not giving any real Answers! You won't get names or anything regarding that matter
So basically it wasn't a balloon. Or why would the pilots wonder how it was remaining or hovering in the air? It would be self evident to the pilots if it was a balloon.
Should xi jinping and ccp start the pacific war, the allies must give him overwhelmingly defeat to make him behave in the corner and decide to follow the international laws and human rights.
If this object was a balloon and it was shot down by a side winder or an aim9  their  would be no balloon left..
Us regular civilians will probably learn the whole truth only when the aliens attack us in anger at one of their spaceships being shot down 😔
UFO 🛸
So silly, there are dozens of amateur and research balloons circling  the globe between 30 and 40 thousand feet, most of them launched from the United States.
And you think that an advanced civilization that have the technology to get to earth, will get shot down by a primitive technology?
Russia and China are both testing the USA for the presence of balls. There's nothing new here.
There's probably some idiot out there in his shed, sending up "copy cat" balloons.
There here!!!
We just shot another one down over Lake Michigan.
If there's one country that should not be firing at UFOs right now, it's the USA.
If we have came in contact with these objects before, why are we shooting them down now?
Build the space wall
The greys won’t visit our planet to anal probe any more😂
It's not aliens!!! It's China or Russia
Ufos and Aliens dont exist its a satanic hoax to prepare for the anti christ.
Rip, Doc and Marty 😭
Over the past 100 years there have been exactly ZERO foreign flying objects shot down over the United States.  In the past ten days there have been FOUR, if you think this is anything other than a distraction,  you need your head examined.
?? More ridiculous 'click bait' with no pilots saying anything about a mysterious object, as promised.
Dear ancient astronauts, I apologize on behalf of our impulsive and ignorant human race on Earth. Please don’t send the Men in Black, that’s too harsh. I hope things would be better 🙏🏻
Distraction something totally different is going down somewhere in the world. This whole thing is BS and its been a couple of days now but all the reports are still non-informative.
Cue the conspiracy theorists...
Blah...blah...blah. Same shit, different political era. Why would anyone believe that the establishment would all of a sudden be forthcoming with an accurate assessment of UFOs? They never were and never will be. This story will be used as a deflection to distract us from REAL issues like overwhelming student debt, homelessness, big pharma's price gouging, systemic racsism, women's rights, run away capitalism, and the crumbling of democracy due to Trump and his merry band of traitors. We humans love shiny objects, and the ruling class knows it. Don't fall for it.
if they find something alien they will make damn shure we know nothing about it
Roswell 2023
Electromagnetic Drone from mother ship, china, russia don't have the tech, U.S. Canada, Grt Brittain, Germany, have the Tech.  I doubt they shot it down, or they shot down decoys .. they gave confusing story's, because they weren't identifying the same drone, there were more than one.
I trust nothing! I don't believe anyone! The only constant I can rely on is JESUS! That's it!
Where the pilot helmet photo?
This "expert" is not actually saying anything at all.  Completely pointless.
aliens are not here to hurt us. but the government want's us to believe that so the one world government can get more power
It's a 🛸 ufo in a mission to probe our Anus holes like the government wants too.
Preping us for false flag
Fighter jet vs. Balloon. Overkill?
It’s swamp gas. 😅
It's funny how this entire UFO shenanigan comes with the appearance of evidence that suggests a US covert op to destroy nordstreams pipelines.
chinese baloons dont have propultion systems.....what a surprise...
Let made stories again.
JERRY SPRINGER NEWS
How is it classified if they done told us what was going on??? I think someone knows something and I think they should tell the American people what they have found because as fo today they have said they have shot down another one, where are these objects coming from? Do they pose a threat? What are the intentions of the objects? Is  Russia or China behind this and if so why are they bitching about when we shoot the things down that come over our air space !!???
CNN IS FAKE NEWS
it s a white flag!!!
Mark my words fake invasion
What are you guys cooking 🍳🔪.
She said sec instead of second. Very suspicious
Wow!   Super Interesting.  Especially where she says it allegedly had no  visible signs of propulsion... 🤔.  USN F18 pilot D. Fravor said the famous 'Tic Tac' he filmed off San Diego with FLIR also had no wings, nor signs of 'Suck and Blow' propulsion.  Essentially that it was like Nothing in the Navy's current inventory that he knew of.  So this may have been another ballon or maybe it was a secret project, or maybe a crippled UFO that was unable to evade?... 🤔.    Maybe Sheit's About to Get Real. 😬.
I was told by an American boy at an inner London school back when I was 11 years old that his farther had told him that he was part of the American Air force that was on constant standby to try to shoot down UFOS so right then  an 11 year old British boy knew more than all the United States Presidents were ever allowed to know.They all ways work on 50 70 years before they let the public or even the President know   so the real news is why are the letting this information out now? What are they hoping to deflect the public attention from?
One wonders if the Chinese balloon was trying to intercept these objects is this a race similar to the lunar landing? Except a race to contact higher intelligence?
The most efficient way for al1ens to get rid of us would be lots of tiny robots that are too small for us to detect. They could get into our hearts before we notice. The best way to get these nano robots to earth would be to store them inside "objects" that can survive re-entry from space and then to release them in the lower atmosphere.
Ufo yah yah yah Jesus  is coming 🙌
REMOTE CONTROLLED ORBS  ( same as the real crop circle tech ) A way for those in the know to KNOW when or whatever message. Clear as the tall grass!
What if it wasn't even true? What if Biden just wanted to try and make it LOOK like he actually takes this kind of stuff serious. (Which he doesn't, he's a CCP LOVER). "Let's "pretend"😉 there was a threat and we took care of it right away since everyone is pissed off at me for screwing up last time."
Maybe it was bait, so another civilisation could found out just how far we've progressed. My the looks of it, not very far.
We shouldn’t ever had instigated a war with Russia in Ukraine! We will lose that war.
Aliens! 👽
Ready for alien invasion????👁️
Lmao! Just more balloons! Fear mongers! Keep us distracted!
I don't see why a UFO, if manned at least, would allow us to shoot them down. Maybe they weren't expecting it? I'd say it's some of our reverse engineered ones that we suck at maneuvering out of harms way. Maybe partly preparing us for their "invasion".  It doesn't seem likely we'd just be able to shoot them down with no fight back or that they didn't have their shields up..
And now a 3rd over Canada??? Are these real or just some made up stuff to fix nothing done on 1st one. And you can't believe these news outlets to tell the truth.
"Not today you new world order bootfucks"
Our so called “president” has nothing to say to the country about these Chinese balloons flying all over the place! WTF
Aliens are demons.
Has anyone seen the President in the last half hour?
Distraction Enaction
If it was aliens i doubt they would have been able to shoot them down since they could fly threw space.
CNN is fake news.
Let's face it Chinese got stuff nobody has ever seen before the technology is more superior than anyone else
Sounds like a coordinated propaganda effort. I don’t trust any of this.
Nope
Roswell 2.0
UFO?
Cnn actually reporting news. Wtf.
If this was extraterrestrial you think they will tell us they truth?
Let's Go Brandon baby!!!
Canadian Truckers in balloons?
👽 👽 Chinese 👽 👽
My advanced UFO 🛸 got shot by a primitive fossil fuel powered paper airplane! 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Please stop shooting at my Valentine’s Day balloons. The cost a fortune to have them flown in😂
They don't say because Americans are overreacting always like south park.. i wish they could say to the rest of the world though.. 🍿
Todo lo que sirva para atemorizar a los humanos..... bienvenido
Alien disclorure
This could be new technology developed by the US where the cover was blown so they have to hide it in plain sight or lie about it later. Don’t be surprised if this is never resolved.
I’m American and I feel that the problem with my country is that they give out too much information in situations like this. We have plenty of citizens from from countries like China and Russia ect. that live here in the U.S.   just by watching the news, someone can call back home (their original country) and give information to encourage an action like the China spy balloon. Heaven help America. This is a theory, so still, let’s be kind to one another.
The same f'd up fbi that screwed off Biden's laptop. The same f'd up fbi that aided in the Russian dis-information against Trump. The Federal Bureau of Idots if you ask me. But no body did so eat 💩💩💩💩🤮🤮🤮😭😭😭😭
Fear mongering, lies and misinformation
If it is aliens do we call them aliens? What if they don't identify as aliens. We don't want to upset them, they, it, its, him, her or whatever. Fuck off world
What’s next, Ebola in Texas again   Total distraction and total bullshit
They are alien scout ships😮😮😮😮😂😂😂😂
Once again CNN out here lying to Americans
It was a floating nothing burger. China will likely flood the sky in Taiwan with these floating objects, like thousands, as well as thousands of cheap winged drones, which will completely deplete all of Taiwan expensive Sam systems. So Chinese might be testing to see how nato detects tracks and eliminates these things with million dollar missiles
OOOOOPs.....Sorry Alien buddy's....LMAO
First meeting,biden adminstration in alaska with chinese delegate headed by the fools blinken, u.s with canada have send 2 warship into chinese water near taiwan strait,the meeting went sour n blinken got trash up,dont u dare teach yr grandfather to suck balls that been told to the new biden adminstration,now chinese weather ballon been blow into american frontier,u yankee really got yr balls shrinks this time, only yr sophiscated f35 can bring it down,when yr airspace have only relised it,god knows how long it was in MOUNTANA state,now u tell me honestly,who actually started this war game,the two warship or the flying ballon(UFO) pentagon have no idea what the shits is happening in u.s airspace,same damn pearl harbour bombing,while u were partying for christmas or biden adminstration all r sleeping with the dragon.yr afganistan failure for 20 yrs(u.s$20 trillion) n now yr damn proxy war in ukraine n trillion dollars trade embargo on russia,PUTIN dont even feel the pinch n u want yr boneless nato to stepfoot into s.e.a,CHINA has said no way u can cross the CHINESE IRON WALLS only for yr feather brain to be bashed up.ONLY TWO BALLON n u still cant find the rest ,that they r still there,somewhere.HUMPTY DUMBTY HAD A GREAT FALL,N NO WAY U CAN PUT IT BACK TOGETHER,BUT U STILL DONT KNOW IT,EVEN IN PAST,PRESENT N FUTURE.
It's Moon Men
Balony
What ever it was, we shut it down and we declare a war to civilization who is bigger than us... But cool Hollywood is becoming real now😂😂😂
USA, NATO, and its allies claim they reached to Moon, and Mars, and they are unable to get rubber n plastic balloon intact without destruction at just 35000 ft. high on Earth? They also claim they shoot down two more objects, WOW, they exposed their capabilities very bad. They are unable to control static non moving objects !!!  All fake and false propaganda for preparing another expensive proxy war.  Shame.
👽🛸💫
The news media are all lying about what is going on the f22 have cameras that can see better than a telescope so I don't believe what they are saying
CHINA FKD UP 🇺🇸
New exotic technologies that no longer use Rocket or Jet engines. We are at the very end of developments of Jet & Rocket technologies. Don't believe anything coming from the King of disinformation, Monster CIA
This is a different object not the same with the chinese spy balloon. . . totallly not related to the events last week. . . Be prepared for a BIG ANNOUNCEMENT in a few weeks.
Why the FBI? Are the USAAF so bad in analysing FLYING objects ?
All they're trying to do is change the narrative, period! There's absolutely no way we shot down a technological advanced UFO period. This things break the laws of physics and they know your next move!  When Trudie and Biden and CNN all say the same thing like this vaccine is safe and effective or that you're going to get 2,000 $ checks you better think twice what these professional liars are saying! All of them are Evil beings!
About the size of delorean.
It was cylindrical and  floating..................... Like  a balloon 🎈
God sent us JOSEPH R. BIDEN  to protect us during these uncertain times
Oh great you big guys had to whip out your missiles and now the aliens are here saying "That's not a missile mate...this is a missile".
The government is not going to tell you the truth on what it is.
Now we have the GOP saying that Joe Biden is "trigger happy." After all the GOP did criticize Joe Biden for taking it a "long time" to deal with the Chinese spy balloon. Now the GOP is saying that Biden should take his time, study the balloon before shooting them down.  The GOP can make her their mind. This is the kind of lunacy The Biden administration has to deal with.
Not one mention of Canada. Here are the facts. Prime Minister Trudeau ordered the UFO shot down, not Biden. it was shot down in Canada, on Canadian territory. Canada is leading the recovery effort, not the US as it isn't on their land. What we are recovering, we are sharing with the USA. P.S. A US F22 shot the kill shot, but only after receiving permission to enter Canadian airspace and help to down it along with Canadian jets.
There is nothing difficult, they all know what is it, as usual they don't want to let us know what is it exactly
These china objects are dropping virus spores....
China is just fking with us. that is all.
Unfortunately we will pay heavily for shooting these down. Stop shooting them down or we will all die.
US is not impenetrable and so as china, russia, and north korea.  if they want war they will get it too.
Conflictings reports from CNN, F35 were launched and F22 shutdown the UFO on Alaska. No wonder!
Was it flying or floating or flying and floating? For gosh shakes do your job?
I don't believe a single word from this media outlet let alone the government and I just retired from the government. Do not believe these people.
The size of a small car ... 🤔 Was it yellow?
Obviously the government knows... You don't watch something for hours, send up jets to look at it some more and then give the go ahead to shoot it down without knowing. That's laughable.
Saying it had no identifiable propulsion system without also mentioning that it wasn't maneuvering and just floating along with the wind is such scummy reporting. Why are you trying to make people think it was some super advanced aircraft? It was clearly another baloon ffs "they dont know how it was cruising at that altitude" are you kidding me?
Born on Earth and breathing its air, freedom is the Religion... Liberty is the Congregation... :)  but one could fight back or reason out, huh?!?   :)

"craft"... 👽
It probably was pitch black out there so the fighters were just shooting anywhere around the craft hoping that they hit something and the government is definitely not gonna let us know what the craft is it's sad when your government won't disclose important issues like this to the people who have a right to know
So it begins.....

What a CROCK
The Chineses SPY BALLOON Is A Distraction Col. Macgregor States What Our REAL Concerns Should Be ON https://youtube.com/shorts/4Kv9Gf1GrnM?feature=share
Hey everyone look up here!!!! While our border is being overrun and the biden administration is crumbling. How old is this chick? 25...she was doing keg stands barely 3 years ago, foh.
A distraction from Biden,  Hunters laptop and FBI twitter files.
The object over Alaska was flying at 46 mph
"I'm not saying its aliens, but its aliens."
Expel all Chinese students out of the USA, half of them are spies, why are we educating the enemy???
This is where we should have  voyed  for Donald Trump. He would know what to do.
If their aliens, they probably took a few years to get here. They are desperate to land . They come in peace, maybe fleeing a dying planet. We kill them.  human kind , not so kind . Wonderful people!
After Russia, now everything is China fault 🤣
👩‍⚕👩‍⚕👨‍⚕👨‍⚕👽 "help me! I'm being analized"
They won't tell you the truth, the pilots aren't going to tell you!
The UFOs look like the tic tac pics when they swarmed the Navy a few years back.
Landed on ice and still it is not retrieved. I am not buying none of this...
Oops, our bad. We figured out it was a weather balloon….
UFO
Is this a joke?
I trust CNN! 🤔
Target practice…weee!
Tell the Truth!!!!!!!!!!.YA!!!!!!!!!.
It was another UFO 👽. We are being  invaded by illegal aliens.  We need to shoot first and ask questions later.
Maybe they are UFOs from outer space!
What I find interesting is that there are so many UFO sightings all over the US.  They don't shoot those down.  This would lead me to believe that what people  have been seeing over the last decades are KNOWN to the Govt.  The fact that they are shooting these down means that they don't know where these come from.
It's the Alien from NOPE.
Whoever had 'alien invasion' as their guess for 2023 is sitting pretty right now.
ET call home.....
Conspiracy theorists be like: Our time has come!
If you are looking for what the pilots did say about the incident , don't waste your time , there is only an interview with a former CIA spook , nothing more.
It was WMD. US successfully shot it down 😂😂😂.
The media and the government has lost all credibility nobody believes shit they have to say
Well. either the chinese/russians are decades ahead in aircraft technology, or little green men from space are real.
When they find out what it is they are not going to tell us dip shit....
😆 the depths to which these intelligence expert "guests" go to in order implicate the U.S.'s two chief adversaries, namely, China and Russia; now there is this wide-eyed wild theory about a brewing "military coup" in China being possibly behind the so-called "spy balloon."  In the meantime...  One U.S. official said that _"without transparency, people will find ways to fill in the gaps."_  Well, there are certainly big gaps, if not big potholes, in the official narratives around "foreign flying objects" that have made the headlines lately.   Number one gap, in the latest "flying object" sightings: the government said that it is *_neither a balloon nor an aircraft._*  Someone somewhere is bound to think it's an extraterrestrial phenomenon.  Number two gap on the latest sightings: they are allegedly *_unguided_* and *_unmanned_* aerial objects with no visible *_intelligence_* capability or *_weaponry._*  And then, we are told that it "made sense" to shoot down the latest foreign "flying objects" _before_ they drifted _deeper_ into the U.S. airspace. This comes after criticism of the Biden administration's handling of the so-called "spy balloon."  The latest foreign flying objects are comparatively "much smaller" than the gigantic "spy balloons," yet they are said to be a much "bigger threat," supposedly due to their "lower" flying altitudes. Conversely, it's anyone's guess what could've been onboard the _high-flying_ "spy balloon"; the contents of the payload could have been "dangerous" at any given point.  The latest flying object was shot down over icey waters, which was cited as one of the reasons for not shooting down the "spy balloon."  The latest foreign flying objects did "not appear to be drifting with precision," but we are told that a "spy balloon" had "clear precision guidance." Nothing is provided on what supposedly gave the balloon its precision-guided drift; was it a fuel-powered mechanical propulsion system, like, say, a turbo engine (jet or propelled)? If the balloon on had one, then it was certainly not visible on the video & photographic captures of the aerial device.  We are told that retrieved "antennas" are "proof" of the balloon's "spying" mission. Antennas are used for receiving and sending broadcast signals. It doesn't have to be a spy device to have antennas.  The U.S. military had no qualms about shooting down a foreign flying object over Canadian territory. Could the debris thereof not have fallen on people on the ground? ...a few gaps among a number of others that could use some "filling up." 🙂
......wtf game is going on here....
This is called garbage click bait, and that is the only reason I am here, since you didnt figure it out your self, considering the billion stupid comments.
The pilot stated he saw a bright red dome glistening in the moonlight, on close inspection it was Brian Stelter in a hand glider.
We have a right to know
Russia took one down a few months ago.
Mulder was right all along! Jokes apart, have you heard that Seymour Hersh published an article claiming the Nord Stream 2 attack was carried out by the US? Did you know that during the 1980s the Air Force Information Service planted documents about ETs on the UFO community to hide the new prototypes of stealth aircrafts like the B2? Have you ever seen a B2? It looks like a flying saucer. Researchers say (it's a hypothesis) that UFO news could have been used to map how news spread through the population. On the Estonian documentary "Disco and Atomic War", about how Estonians could receive the Finish TV signal and how the USSR strangely never jammed it, the filmmaker found documents at the KGB (made public after 1991) showing the agency was using the event to study how Sovietic populations would react to western Propaganda. (this last one is not a hypothesis - it's documented).  Here's an example in dance and soccer about misdirection:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snq82HqUw1A
Imagine putting this clown at an anchor desk.
This is dumb how do they shoot something and not know we’re it is
It could be that it comes from China but is private in origin. a "backyard" operation.
I predicted covid I predicted the war in Ukraine I predicted world war 3 and here we go aliens how did I know all of these things am I a prophet a God have I been gifted powers from the future you see what you want to do is just open your Bible to Revelations I shit you not it tells you plain as day what will happen
Ufo
I didn't have 'Chinese military coup' in my 2023 bingo
I've NEVER seen any evidence of a whirling, twirling, hurling, hurtling, wibbling, wobbling, zipping and zooming, spinning space ball, "planet" earth.  Have you?  Got any?
It was aliens and we have just started an interplanetary war. This should be great for the war profiteers and may put a delay on killing everyone in Ukraine and Russia. I was told this by reliable sources within the media and government know it alls.
I threw a beercan in the air over there!
WWIII it's All a Distraction!
It could be balloons and objects made out of the spoiled evil Putin's huggies diapers since China 🇨🇳 gave him ideas now. China better watch it too and shoot them down since Putin's diaper balloons could drift off course and go into their air space they could have something highly dangerous inside of them. They say Putin wears diapers since he poops on himself alot now.☠️ 🎈🎈🎈🎈☠️☢️☢️☢️☢️💀☣️☣️☣️☣️💀🦴☠️💀🦴☠️🦴☠️🦴
Stop being gullible they be shooting down those balloons down humans aren't even capable shooting down extraterrestrial air crafts what a bullshit story
Looks like we've started a war with aliens.
please use the metric system
If it was a gravity propulsion system, then it makes sense that no one saw it.
" Independence Day III". Where is Will Smith when you need him?
The setting for a Hollywood sci-fi movie
Billion dollar fighting jets without a go pro camera … at least?
it was ET
Provocation of course.. you sure it wasn’t a WMD???…
Invasion
Just like any other type of investigation, it is not wise to speculate in the beginning because when it is all finally revealed, it will be the complete opposite of what we thought.
I don't want to be 'that' guy, but I hate when someone who wasn't there diminishing what one of the pilots, who WAS there, that's why people get suspicious
Balloongate ala Beijing!
they basically just said nothing about the subject.
Aliens! Can't fool us anymore! Crab octopus people, came in peace and we shoot them down.   ugh.
Quote on quote “Penetrating China’s 🇨🇳 Circle ⭕️ is and has been impossible” 🤨 🧐 🤔 6:23 While New Age America 🇺🇸 has lost it’s way along with it’s Toughness, Integrity, Morality, selfless Bravery and Leadership, Family Values, Honor and Pride. We Lost our Grit and Conviction that was EARNED through Sacrifice, Blood 🩸 Sweat and Tears that our Parents and Grandparents fought Tooth and Nail for just to see it all go to shit before thier eyes 👀..  this Country has Lost its way, Mind, Morals and Soul.. The division multiplies on a daily basis with each passing law for another protected class of abominations and double standards it’s sickening how many agendas are being forced into children’s curriculum, Work Place Policy to the point you can’t even call a person by their name without them going to Human Resources Department because they, them, it, he , she was wasn’t referred to by their proper pronouns. Males or Females depending on what they identify with that day use the assigned restroom that is suitable to their gender and identity that day.. America 🇺🇸 look around… who’s going to defend our country? 1/2 the population is Obese and the rest of the majority are confused about how to identify themselves….
Omg Natasha you are gorgeous!
imagine 5 daily and not knowing what they carry, having to shot them all down daily or thousands at once.. it could well be used for a DOS attack on the air defense capabilities. To overload them.
Well if it’s aliens I’m not shocked , funny how these things always happen with Americans involved ..
Why did the UFO fly over Canada? To get shot. Well, ok, I'll collect the tomatoes but please throw boiled eggs next time.
eu queria que fosse alienígenas 🤭
We send out Voyager probe with a greeting from Earth... Anything that enters Earth that isn't schooling these jet pilots is shot down. Kinda like how Europeans came to North America, Australia and South America...said they were friends...used the natives, killed many of the natives, then stole their land. All this done by a society that preaches no murder, no theft blah blah lying bs blah. We have so much to learn.
Maybe it is North Korea stirring the pot...
It was Santa Claus
The pilots couldn't explain how it stayed in the air. Which means I get to propose whatever the hell mechanism I want!
Sooo actual UFO?
Cover up.... cnn.msnbc and the biden administration  will never tell us..   our government  can not be trusted!!!
Yep that’s play the classified game because all of us people are stupid as a military vet. It’s just ridiculous. And who in the hell believes what the CIA has to say are you kidding me? I don’t want to speculate this is our government for you oh brother.
Dollar store balloons from china  wasting millions of dollars.
Detected also in china just now
The media always mocks mysterious "UFO" sightings until now. And they are speculating without saying names or quotes. We're just being redirected.
Another bullshit clikbait story...
"No identifiable propulsion"!? Unless this was JPL's experiment, only one answer remains: 👽/🛸 😄 |  😲
Oh,☺ Trump can take a pounding, just ask George Santos, being a volleyball champion, he knows how to spike balls.
It's a Tic Tac UAP...not a balloon...not from China, Russia, nth Korea. These military/defence folk are covering up what is going on. It's a smokescreen for some background shenanigans by the US to pick a fight with China after the ballon intrusion days ago. Smoke, mirrors, deception.
Dear god they are shooting down ufo’s now…hold on folks!
When i was in the airforce and we sent planes up to investigate, there was always a camera mounted to a pod to take photos, so wondering did they photo these before shooting
Just realized your "expert" is actually an actor   Anyone remembers the TV show " colony", in which THIS GUY played a resistance boss?
ET..phone home..phone home..
Wow, they're really geting desperate for distractions.  Im mire eorried about the cirrent excess deaths in young people.  Especially young athletes.   Talk about ignoring the elephant in the room.  🐘
This classless douchebag still employed by cnn….sad sad sad..
China is about to form an alliance with Russia.
If only CNN had good journalists on their staff.  Get someone on there that can ask good questions and hold this administration responsible for vague and sometimes misleading explanations.  Come on!  We the people want to know just how vulnerable we are.
Probably came from the war ships in the Bering Straits.
I feel like we’re being played
I think it's called a "balloon" - they've been around for several hundred years.  When you have nothing to say, don't let that stop you from talking.  My IQ lost five points from watching this.
ALIENS ARE CONFIRMED 100% today this is history of course we always knew it but this is the day! THE DAY OF THE SUPERBOWL!
Spirit world has the ability to change how each individual perceive something... Based upon the individuals relationship with God 🙏🙏🙏... You will battle your flesh until the day you die... There are only two ways to make a decision either in the spirit or the flesh, wake up to the one who created you...Amen....
The government is now giving us immediate access to all the info of the mission amd everything? Idk feels fishy
Something interesting must be happening in Antarctica "neuschwabenland" region.
A simple phone call... to The Walton Family...
The aliens better fix their GPS systems.
Not trustong CNN but im desperate for info on this thing even if it may be cnn misinfo
Must have been a shape shifter
Oh just great! The aliens finally came to share their higher intelligence and help save humanity and OF COURSE we go and shoot it down.  Dumb a$$es!🙄
Stop lying to us CNN there is nothing like unidentified flying object,it's Alien space craft either from grey's or reptilian or Arthurian craft you ppl can't hide because there is so much ufo ships presence in America in the entire of Asia south America and north America and Australia Canada and gulf nation and Israel and middle east.Excerpt west Africa where we don't know or have contact with extraterrestrial technology etc.I know the aliens advance your A.I machine learning technology dark matter technology satellite NASA space mission and your computerized telescope infact the grey aliens helped advance your military and everything with German scientist who had experience with them eastern western Europe and west america and Canada UK and Australia we know aliens advance your race technology building machine building they are co creators gods and ancestors all your future power to control the world including china and developed nation especially us navy intelligence and secret navy space programs and air force programs are behind the ufo Manchurian scientist agenda.Pinder is behind it all.We know so much ,you try to use Google a.i to censor information but you ly ashtar command and pleiadian council and Sirian high council will not all you,aliens from planet Zidineta I know most of your scientist havent heard planet Zorpia and Zidineta because the plasmaelectric beings don't come from our universe and dimension but from a higher universe and dimension.Stoo lying to the masses tell them how global corporation and banks manufacturing CEO and executive buy technology from the secret cabal council via the alien grey reptilian draco alliance.We ain't fools I I knew about ufo back in 1997.
I just hope they are not Tyranids man.
Natasha is a total Babe!
Fox Mulder's got this case!!
Military aircraft have cameras.  Show the pictures.
Aliens 🤣🤣 talk about trying to cover 💩 up It was probably a mig 29
It's a distraction to take your eyes off the real failures of the Biden administration.. and how they are loosing their narrative  . Watch  the congress on the house floor instead of this nonsense..
Why not call up The Walton Family and ask them what China sent over?  The Walton Family has given China $500 Billion per year, year after year after year after year, to build-up China's Military.  Why wouldn't China?
Um, wouldn't the pilots be barred from releasing any information without being debriefed on what they can actually say?
No info here?
What, are we seeing how far up their as**s they can pull out this conjecture.
Yankees are getting paranoid, nothing new
We better stop fighting amongst ourselves and pay attention to what matters
My guess this is just testing from other governments to see how asleep at the wheel our chief bumblehead is operating.  As soon as they get all of our military scrambling, the same government(s) will attack Taiwan.
Testing NORAD response times.
What if it was friendly alien species that didnt understand our communications and we shot it down?  Remember the Twilight Zone episode where they killed the stranger because he was different and he had the cure for cancer written down in the book the townsfolk burned? Hmm
Pinchi Acosta
cnn trash
They've tried for years to shoot down UFOs and failed miserably. And now?....they easily take one down...lol. ok. #prohectbluebeam much. No proof..? Lets see if the debris is as good as the flight that crashed at the pentagon.
What a load of cobblers we all know there not allowed to say nothing so obviously cnn is up to something
So what they are telling us is, eye witness account isn't worth anything. Our "justice" system thrives on eye witness account .
As if the billion dollar jets r not equipped with camera
Diversion?
Dünyayı abd kandırmaya çalışıyor
https://youtu.be/MPg0VlunUNI. The future
I think this is done for irritating u.s. their up to something. Distraction from Russia and China for maybe something else ?Don't trust communists they re secretive right?
No pictures? What happened...forgot to put film in the camera? Or too busy taking selfie TikTok TopGun photos of themselves and ran out of memory???
The pilots has radar video and won’t show the people. The government will hide it from the people. Wasting a 400000.00 dollar missile.
using missiles to down a balloon is overkill; a cannon burst would have been sufficient and would have made the balloon go down gradually, possibly saving it for further scrutiny more or less intact
The tag said made in china !
Can the anchor just get to the point?
Booo, nothing special.  So what,  turd robot.
2018 chinese billionaire Liu Ruopeng was duke uni student accused of steal metamaterials AKA WEAPONS CLOAKING TECH  doesnt seem far fetched they got their own now
alien monitoring spacecraft already here and they kept it secret...this aliens are preventing or trying to prevent a nuclear war...they are watching us..
It's not aliens. Proof: No intelligent species would want ANYTHING to do with us.
China and Russia together checking US Defence systems response and testing Bidens nerves...
Just shot down ETs’ Uber ride
Gotta love that damage control, just put it on China then the people will think less of it. People on earth have been putting things out in the solar system for years it's just a matter of time something answers back.
It belongs to area 51. Lol
They must be spaying some type of disease to kill Americans
Its America that flew the SR71 and the U2 over every country on earth at will. Now they get a taste of their own medicine and surprise surprise they dont like it!
These are UFO's
There has to be photos of these objects. Why is no one asking to see them?
As politically compromised as the FBI is, it disgusts me THEY were given thr mandate to collect and analyze this object.
Bullshit!
not to start any crazy american  conspiracy theory.... but they just shot down the UFO that wanted to return Elvis....
Maybe CNN abbreviations for communist News Network shouldn't be fabricating and theorizing about stuff they don't even know and trying to stoke fear into naive ignorant individuals who watch CNN
The ghosts of the Franklin expedition
CNN: this is just a distractor so when are you going to address how Obama, Hillary and some other US politicians are colluded with Mexican high level corrupt cop Garcia Luna and that some of them received money from the cartels ?? is this issue just a NYC headline?? are you avoiding this for some reason??
Shoot first and ask guestions later?  So much for confidence in a supposedly high level, high budget institution as the US Air force.
CNN Sucks
This guy might be an expert in his field but he’s talking nonsense right here.  He’s just a CNN commentator pulled in on short notice….. this is common in the media….
🛸👽👽🧬🌎❤️
1. Testing "scramble time." Monitoring communications (immediate vicinity) to find out when interceptors are given orders to either launch or intercept. 2. .... I prolly shouldn't say.
The Truth is Out There be Ready for Disclosure
Can't believe anything on lying CNN.
I just love the transparency from this administration lol
Chinese or other are simply doing weather and ice pack checks the Arctic has become the new frontier for global trade routes
They can report anything they want and the public will believe it....but I dont!! Lol 😆 thanks biden for the 28million jobs created by his administration , where are those jobs? China ...that's where.
It's and object from  Mars.
If they are aliens, they are pretty lame in self preservation.
If you're thinking about a hot air balloon ride these days, I'd postpone until things settle down. The Goodyear blimp might want to consider counter-measures for tonight's game.
UAP 🛸!
I thought that was Audrey Plaza
The origination of that object will likely be tracked back to The Pleiades! Because of the location of the debris site, the aliens will blame Canada!  Time for Canadians to start mounting loudspeakers in the backs of pickup trucks, and purchase ever available Slim Whitman recording!😮😮😮
Where is the gun camera footage?
Did CNN just make up a story about what pilots said when the inky thing they can say is " I can niether confirm nor deny"
Aliens man, it's the f***ing aliens
Fake news
Its the Chinese showing the world that they have dementia joe under there thumb.
Great ,  FBI gonna investigate & give us credible information I'm sure the same level as Roswell , weather balloon story
Shit ain't no telling it could be the new covid they are putting in the air.  Y'all stay safe and keep ya hands off of stuff. Keep your skin covered.
The government knows exactly where these are coming from and everything they just won't tell us any info.  You don't think they coulda tracked one via satellite and found where they launched from.
Apparently, the object was identified as being of a phallic shape. It so happened that one of the 2 pilots who identified 'the shape' was man and another a woman which caused distortion of their perception. Apparently, according to FBI, Xi's secret service recently employed a Freudian psychologist who assisted in the design of this not-yet-identified phallic object. FBI expects that the next UFO is going to be of a vag in a shape to complement the phallic one just shot down.
Just another balloon propelled by wind
The one Pentagon just said there was a UFO flying over America
I remember thinking when this year started "And what bullshit might 2023 bring? Aliens probably haha" 😦
Fonzie went airborne when jumping the sharks and now has been found.
Biden is surrounding China right now building military bases provoking them into a war like he provoked Russia.  Biden will hand the US over to them when he weakens us down enough
R-Type Delta USA - The Chyna Empire - "In the new Super Nintendo game from Irem you take control of humanities secret weapon= R-Rype.

The "Tic-Tac"' is Chinese
Said the pilot: "I saw God."  :)
No one is asking how fast it was going....hmmmmm...no wings...no propulsion system....It's an alien drone checking us out ...the mother ship is cloaking somewhere between the moon and Earth. Theyre Here !!!!
China, Russia or aliens lol.
Fbi is not the best for the job, this is a homeland security issue , so why is it we cannot track to sender?? We can... but the same circle that would do this have been lying all along.if we are the strongest nation then show the proof?? You and I will be the first to know and the first to go....boom. thanks Biden.
Still don’t know what it is or where it cam from lol China News Network
Man something is up.  I could see it being China testing us or getting to cause a blackout so we would destroy ourselves before they marched in.
Old school way of finding out what the response is .      Get the enemy to respond and learn from that.   See what systems pick up the objects  find out where it is tracked from .    Pretend that the actions are benevolent.    Find weaknesses  in the system to be exploited later.
Would the US government tell us if this was a vehicle from another world?
This feels like an invasion of our airspace - whoever it is needs to face retribution. What would happen if this brought a domestic plane down?so reckless
It's going to be a nothing to see here folks. These are all weather balloons
End of NATO countries, every day sending weapon's to Ukraine 🙄 last one year,no use NATO countries people angry with USA jo all NATO countries pay more money for food 🥝 next 25 years,
Spy drones and diplomatic smoke curtain.
Next week this will be swept under the rug and never spoken of again...
Unsub   all BS Media where ever you find them
Super girl got shot 🦸
We behave like we are children this is serious we didn't have to shot it down to destroy in order to preserve it
It's all smoke screens to put our eyes else where I'm sure. Weird even the pilots don't have the same storyline and there are no photos or explanations
So they know nothing or are not saying anything. What's new.
These bastards are lying to us as usual....they know a lot more and are covering it up......Shooting something down and not knowing what it is is Incredibly STUPID.
me thinks how did that object get so far before they woke up to something in their air space visions of 45 at the sinking of the 7th fleet are we really protected  seems  a bit slow to me.
Take it seriously.  A balloon can spread an airborne virus; which satellites can't do.  A weaponized COVID variant or any other virus with a long incubation period could be the end of us.
It really isn’t hard to see a ufo nowadays.
Suddenly those doomsday preppers don't seem so kooky now!
it was aliens
Okay everybody, go play the x files song. Lol
Would Shooting down a UFO possibly be considered an act of war to an alien race? If it turns out to not be from planet earth? hmmm, I wonder how this scenario will play out.
They all saw different things? Were they all hallucinating on drugs or are they just as dumb as they sound ? What a bunch??
Fantastically interesting, but oh, Natasha, Natasha Bertrand...  So beautiful, sooo smart.  I know I'm too old for you, but I noticed no ring on your finger...  I've made a huge scientific discovery, maybe we could talk about it?  Haven't seen you since I unplugged from MSNBC, missed you.
I am in contact with aliens all the time i do not work for gover nment or media. Some of them are dieties that u probably know.
Oooooooo !    Always count on CNN to tell us exactly what they're TOLD to say by the D.S.  In the meantime . . . let's just all stay scared and keep our frequency low.
It's obviously fucking aliens 👽.
Expect drones to be used next. It may both China and Russia doing this.
..I've read enough Car & Driver mags to know this was GM testing their latest Jetzons-styled flying car. It even had the black & white camouflage stickers on it 🧐
Are there no cameras on U.S. military jets?!?!
What’s the problem? USA has sent a uncountable objects over China . Strange no-one talks about those!!?
They're Here............
Even if it is a craft not of this world, there is no way in hell that they’ll admit it. Never!
CNN is collectively so stupid they don't even know when they're being played.
Real news
Scary if another country has this tech. I don’t think ppl understand how hard it is to sustain these altitudes with no visible propulsion. We better HOPE AND PRAY these are non violent aliens and not China or Russia 😂
Tiktak???
Am I the only one who is scared that the USAF shot down something that should not have been shot down? I mean Size of a car, hovering at 40,000 feet, no visible propulsion or balloons. Pilots either know what something is, or they don't  know what something is. And if they don't know what this was. Then I am a bit concerned.
What if this is an enemy sending bullshit objects that way they can study united states time to respond to threats
to me it is object to spy by Putin .. not China as is the Ballons
The unidentified cruising  craft affected their sensors.   very common trait of extraterrestrial craft.   Pilots couldn't determine propulsion system and different  descriptions.   Hhhmmm???
This is getting to be like the beginning of a War of the Worlds scenario
والله مدري عنكم لكن انا اصدق ان الاجسام الطائرة فعلاً موجوده وقد راصدوها بكاميرات من سنيين قديمه والى الان يتم رصدها حتى صارت باكثر من مكان ليس فقط بامريكا قد حصا بمكه وروسيا والخ.. فكر فيها شوي ترا الفضاء كبيررر كبيررر جداً اكبر من البحر واعماقه ومجراته كثيره لذلك ماكذب ان فعلاً ممكن فيه حياه اخرى وفيه فضائيين او كائنات اخرى لا نعلم شي عنها، مدري لكن ذا الموضوع يثير عقلي جداً
Soon everyone must buy something so the ufo cannot identify ur existence
It is funy how usa defend sistems havent shot down non of this objects
They couldn’t communicate with it
Speak to a dozen independent (haven't spoken with each other) traffic accident witnesses and you'll get at least a dozen different narratives.  You KNOW that, CNN.  Lay off the hype about the pilots telling conflicting stories.
Seriously this fuss about a "Chinese" spy balloon and other "UFO's". I assume the USA and its allies are utilising whatever resources they have at its disposal to spy on China. Is the USA now saying they can spy on whoever they like but nobody can spy on them. I suspect if China is spying they are being a bit more sophisticated than using balloons!
Wait why soo hostile
The end is near
What the heck is going on
WE THE PEOPLE ARE DONE WITH YOUR CRAP!!!🔥🔥🔥
And now they say, our technology is just good enough NOW to detect these…Yeah okay….So what is ACTUALLY happening now???
I wonder how the comedian is feeling about Biden's quite literal, new shiny object?
Some D.C. bozo got out his pad of Top Secret suckers. Why?  It's China's intel package for Christ sake. Who are you keeping it secret from..
Have the pilots been given permission to speak? Has it been verified that these were the actual pilots?  Seems odd that the pilots would be allowed to comment. Usually, comments  come from a DoD  spokesperson. A bit odd.
Biden started a war with aliens.
F the Super Bowl. Too much damn hype over a game!
Who cares.
I like this anchor so much. So easy to listen to.
2 weeks later it was some experiment for YouTube gone wrong
In all my experience listening to Art Bell, this is a UFO.
Natasha bimbo. Lol. Fake news
*WE know what it was*   👽👽👽👽👽👽
If it was aliens, why on earth would they be checking out Northern Canada, it's a frozen wasteland
Maybe Canada is responsible.  They are coming from that direction?
Alien mothership calling in the big guns after detecting hostile life forms.  Probably not, but hey, it gets ratings.
The Super Bowl should be canceled. This is a national emergency
Wasn’t this all predicted as part of the narrative?  Let me guess - next steps -  restriction of commercial air travel. More controls - more surveillance.
*It was GEORGE SANTOS*
Is someone or something trying to send 10% to the big guy, via objects?
IF WE SHOOT DOWN A UFO...HOW DO WE KNOW ITS SAFE TO STUDY AND NOT A WEAPON STILL.....THE PENTAGON FELL FOR A TROJAN HORSE..........COME TO LIGHT ....TELL US
Why is no one asking what speed it was going
U.S., Russia and China probably  all have reverse engineered UFO technology
If they were close enough to determine there were no surveillance equipment on board they that means they had a clear view of this object. Let’s see the pictures.
Lack of information says a lot
We should not provoke hostilities with inter-dimensional beings.
You silly bastards have shot down an unknown object perhaps something different than they thought. What if they have shot down a alien object? To shoot without identification is utterly irresponsible and if it be something"off world"let's say, then shooting at an "off world"product would be something very regrettable to say the least. What if we are beging studied watched by someone else? What will they think of us now? It would be equally exciting and equally terrifying but all the same an amazing thing to ponder apon. Now shooting anything unidentified especially if it be alien in origin is dangerous and stupid. No visible propulsion, jamming of sensor equipment these are the tell tale sign's of a typical uap/UFO phenomena. It could be that these others were not expecting to be fired apon as is standard procedure to not shoot down something that has not been identified. Let's hope they haven't shoot down sometime from someone else because we've already got an international incident let's hope our political leaders don't start an interstellar incident. Even more terrifying is the prospect that international adversaries have technology that is able to do all these things without it being a balloon this would be a world game changer in regards to defences and security. What ever the ancer maybe it's certainly a very strange outcome of events and I think may continue to escalate in ways we've never seen before?
They need to admit it!  It's a giant snow cone maker! Plus a question,  how is the pilots account of the event available to the public? I'd assume it's classified?  No,  fake news gets all the hot leads! Thank you for the continued effort to frighten uneducated citizens you report to.
Funny how Bob automatically assumes it’s from China 🤔
China/russia/Iran/n.korea playing game to read our deffense system pattern... Major Red flagg
Why doesn’t anyone ask how fast the object was moving?
He said the balloon was at 40k feet while the graphic showed it at 60k feet. What gives?
America is about to fuck around and find out
Don’t believe shit from these guys
I'm more worried about the people on the ground than what's up in the air I could care less what it was or where it came from
Meanwhile Elon is joking about ufos
Definitely not aliens, they're too good to get shot down by Humans
The map at 0:25 seems to imply that the balloon was carrying a dead horse. This is some kind of test run, imagine if they launched 10,000 balloons at the same time.
Where’s Elon Musk on all this?
It could be virus transfer...be careful
Whats the radar saying
Trump 's Time Machine
Can’t wait for Jo Rogans take on this come Monday
Lies
ALL BULLSHIT TO START A WAR WITH CHINA.
The great balloon caper lol. Imagine the cost to do what's going on with balloons 🤣⚪🎯
Eslweege S'N'Lor Neegues 2023?
Mach 6......no wonder your on CNN especially Jim Acosta....2 boneheads who have no clue what your talking about Mach 6.....haha lol...whooooo....knee slapper...
US currently designing a F23. No weapon pods just a large pin on the nose for popping balloons.
That's just mass suicide cult leader Marshall Applewhite coming back in the mothership to pick up more of his followers.
An F-35 needs to be traveling at a minimum of 115 mph to remain airborne.  I challenge anyone to drive by an object, say the size of a car, at 115mph trying to discern details of that object.  Obviously the F-35 is traveling faster than that and the object is likely not displaying any identifiable markings.  I find it a little preposterous for CNN to imply the inconsistencies of the pilots means anything of any consequence.  Let alone, I doubt these are legitimate “pilot statements”.
was it george santos  in a alien UFO  craft?  Because   george is a champion swimmer and would get away quickly................
"Ice Station Zebra" all over again.
Sounds a lot like the Tic-Tac UFOs observed earlier bij Navy Pilots https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1kGmUliDNs
Sounds like it’s over Buck!
More fake news
If it's extra-terrestrial, we would ALL love to know.
The 👽👽👽 have found us 😂😂😂😂
Come on! UPS started using flying saucers and flying cigars. I don't know for sure, I just wanted to say what nobody else is saying.
https://youtu.be/fNjNj6yGB4k
Landed on frozen water? Now wait just a minute. Haven't they been telling us there is no more frozen water?
It might be like independent day. The UFO mother ship could be close by.
like jetski ? inside propulsion ?
"Unlike the Chinese spy balloon, it didn't require immediate action. "... really? That's not news. That's an opinion.
NOBODY had a camera. Duh
Now how comes they ain't showing this object lol 😆
The problem is that they are like potato chips, can't shoot down just one
The F-35 has the VERY BEST radar electronics to give the fullest profile of the object. ' no propulsion' and " not a balloon"....makes it a UFO. That's not a National Security threat.
Come on, we know its a UFO... just say it... its E.T.... he wont be phoning home anytime soon.
Aliens 🤷🏾‍♂️
Werner Von Braun began privately telling Carol Rosin, a colleague at a major aerospace company Fairchild Industries, about a sequence of contrived global false flag “cards” such as asteroid impacts and extraterrestrial invasion, which would lead to the militarization of space and usher in a New World Order. Now more than 40 years later, the sequence predicted by Von Braun appears to be on the verge of playing out as mainstream media increasingly speculate about asteroid strikes and an alien invasion in what many believe are cases of predictive programming.
ET
Jim sucks.
No propulsion except......WIND!!!
cnn still making shit up
Never trust cnn or the government they got an agenda we won’t ever know what’s in the craft or who I should say. I’ve heard it’s monitored by consciousness
Swamp gas again! There more willing to go to war with China than say they have captured tech better than oil. The air force has been seeing these things for a while now with the new radars. Now for the first time a brand new Aim9 can shoot them down. So CNN blames China? Wake up people! This is a false flag operation! These are not balloons or from earth.
How many non-friendly other countries are sitting there giggling about how easy it is to flip Americans out about UFO's. Somebody's having a lark, just to show they can! That's my uneducated theory 😀
Where's MULDER & SCULLY when u need them ??
If they haven't blame the Chinese or the Russians is because it was something else 👽
CNN, so probably BS.
Spreading fear, hate and discontent. Way to go - main stream media sucks. NOT news - pure speculation.
The guy in the gray sweater was as vague as the pilots who did/didn't identify the object.
👽
So what we know for sure, we will never be told the truth.
We come in piece, USA we shoot it down. Aliens we are 1 milion year before your tec. Voj voj voj
Wow have not seen the pic of it it's on one piece looks like a big white pill
E.T.?
Oh F u k. The FBI is in control, they'll blame the Catholic's
I think they lying
Another smokescreen. What are they trying to distract us from? FBI. must be Trump-Russia.
THEY'RE  HERE.  👽😱
What happened to the U2 reconnaissance  plane they used to observe the balloon they shot down last week? Boeing RC-135? Lockheed P-3 Orion? These might be too slow, but there are definitely regular military  jet aircraft with cameras that could be scrambled and record images/video before it was shot down.
thank u madam president👏🏼👏🏼
What is the purpose though?? They can already spy on us directly through our phones or with satellites, so, kind of a wasted effort if that's what they're going for with these "objects"?? Maybe it's supposed to be  some kind of test or distraction? Can't think of any other purposes that would be worth concealing
UAP 🛸
It's definitely Chinese.  That's all we know.  Be afraid of China, so our government can print more money for our "defense."
This is good for the sheep and nothing more or less 🙄
If CNN, NPR, ABC, Colbert, or Fox are pushing this story, then you know it is a distraction.
The final card will soon be played and the media are in on it.
Becareful could be sleepy joes dirty diapers
Open your minds and stop with the warmongering.  Airborne technology thousands, if not millions, of years more advanced than our own most advanced technology.   It's not a mysterious "foreign adversary". It's a big Universe. Just look up.
These planes have "gun" cameras and can be turned on with the press of a button.
que secureteam 10
Elvis,Mork,and Hitler are on vacation from Ork lol
What about no.4 over lake huron?
THE ANNUNAKI ARE COMING FOR MELANATED PEOPLE
It's funny how reporters say "the pentagon doesnt know" when what they mean is "i dont know"
A picture potentially taken from one of the jet fighters would help.
Didn’t know what direction it came from😮……so there is no security shield around the airspace
Jebus is cumin
Men in black cowboys vs aliens…. I can keep going
I find that very strange the FBI is going to look into it should it not be the military because the FBI is conspiracy they're gonna make a lot of people believe there's UFO's when there's not this has been the plan all along
We're is the film clips
Kidding 😁
Sad that we live in the age of news reporting without factual information
Seems like a great idea to shoot down something that's not firing at you or dont know what it is? Shoot first and ask questions later?
Maybe aliens are coming to save earth from facist.
A fighter plane was not required.  It could have been taken whole by other air-craft
Was the object a silver DeLorean?
I'm fascinated that no-one wants to say extra-terrestrial
Accidentally bumping into a real ufo hunting balloons 😂😂😂😂 🎉
Aliens finally here........
get Spooky Mulder on the case 🛸
This whole entire thing is a crock of shit. Reeks of a false flag to distract from something else. Par for the course for CNN to put spooks on to tell us what to think.
Jamaica?
And since these balloons/objects there seems to be no concern about the Classified Documents, we now have "something else" to focus on... Isn't that just convenient. 🤔
God damnit, China made first contact with the aliens didn't they?
I never heard so many lies in one show from CNN than this one
Another one spotted over Montana!
I watched this clip to the very end, and CNN's "Hear what pilots said about mysterious object shot down near Alaska" title turned out to be just another click-bait, an outright lie! Clips like this  do CNN's tattered reputation no favors. All this ends up being is lame speculation from beginning to end. No one really knows anything, so everyone speculates ad nauseum. Those that might know something are not talking, so we just have to wait...
If an enemy  sends 10,000 balloons,which would not cost that much, it could confuse, bog down or overwhelm the  military. Can the military afford to shoot down 10,000 balloons with expensive missiles?
Just a little while ago another object was just shot down over Lake Huron!
Unknown object the size of a small car, unmanned, apparently not self-maneovering... I'll go with the obvious and say it's a small parked car. But, who parked it up there? THAT'S the real question, & did they forget to pay the meter?
I’m not sure why people think a balloon has to have a propulsion system. Have you never let go of a helium balloon and watched it travel away (not just straight up)? Wind… it’s a little known phenomenon.
Alien, or ours?
So you're going to blame China Russia
And not a word to the American people from your president. Let’s go brandon
They are aliens 👽
Good job,don’t know what it is,just shoot it down.
Why not use a high speed camera to shoot it as the jet passes?
China and Russia most likely leaped the United States in technology. We don't know what they have honestly.
USA Zionist government it's going to be so busy this year it looks like shutting bolluns  Keeping USA citizens save hahaha 😆 😂 🤣 😜
Sounds like bullshitt to me
Can't wait until the aliens are revealed from the frozen abyss..that'll leave man baffled with a lost for words.
What we do know is that our current administration are a bunch of weak, incompetent, rollover, piss on them self, fools, and we can’t trust our government to be truthful with us on little stuff much less big stuff. The rest of the world is looking at America and laughing at us all.
Spy Balloon  these NUTZ    !
What's being released into the air when these 🎈 are shot down? Hopefully nothing bio hazardous!😳
Fn Chinese in cahoots with the aliens
To be an F35 or F22 pilot you must be the best of the best. Those pilots know pretty damn well what they shoot down. Its the Pentagon who is telling them what to say about it.
No one knows exactly this object came from? How dare this Bear be accused of this object is from the Chinese or Russian? Even the pilots can't even tell how this object is flying.
All the weirdo kids will have UFO fun till they take it to bits ....then the weirdo conspiracy kids will have fun about the bits.
They are giving "conflicting accounts" because there was NOTHING THERE ! They can't get together on a story to tell.
So what kind of lies will they come up with or will they tell the truth
Aliens!!!
They want to control the narrative just like when they invaded 🇮🇶
China considers our patrols in the South China Sea to be incursions.   It is possible that these are payback by China.
Hahaha I loved it Americans shutting down bolluns what strong USA army  I don't think eny contry in world can do that shutting bolluns
Please don’t start a war with the aliens.
If the mainstream news is reporting this, than the government wants is to know, why
it's another spy balloon or spy craft they declared unknown to avoid political conflict by another country. like china did overacted last week or another subject so that people will be sidetracked to Ukraine and Russia war.
Facts?
Hmm Could the pilot have used the gun instead of firing a missile. cost of a burst of machine gun, maybe lets say a $1,500 vs $1,000,000+ plus fuel etc. Cost of ballon with decoys?. America needs to Wacht its pockets or we are going to break the bank. Remember Afghanistan.
So without any substantial evidence at all this ex-CIA operative has called these unidentified flying objects not only balloons, but Chinese balloons, even though there is no evidence they originated from China or that the fallen debris have been categorized as belonging to balloon type objects.  LOL
Maybe it's Boba Fetts ship
People are so afraid to say it's possible it could be extraterrestrial. They would even way the word
if the fbi is in control we will never know the truth
I guess it's just a weather balloon.
Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind
Would this be consider a Top Secret Mission, and can top secret information be shared? How can they speak of what the pilots saw? If media is sharing, then share details, photos, recordings, etc…
fake news
I smell a PsyOp.
Probably a bored alaskan schoolboy sending up some kind of remote craft
😂😂 been waiting  for the aliens since the covid bullshit started. Hope it's a bit more exciting than the covid nonsense.
Humans have become so stupid that the aliens have decided "its time"!
His reporting means nothing ....
If build back better was a radar system
Let's not stoke the conspiracy folks or those getting out of bed every morning selecting their outrage for the day. This is the natural result of the difference between demanding now every fact that can only be determined after investigation and analysis and wanting an inflammatory headline or internet story
I knew Baer would downplay it
To Some It Up It Was An Alien Craft 🤌🏾 Common Sense Tells You " See how they came out about the "balloon" bht cant say anything on this plus, they said no typa of wings or anything 🤷🏾‍♂️ so use ur head  what else could it be 😮
Sounds like we're being lied too
Why are we still relying upon pilot description? Do literally none of these pilots have access to a camera function?
I hope it wasn't a UAP!!! Then we in trouble!!!!
USA must come up with fishnets like  device with weight attached and a parachute that can be launched from a craft at these UFO and lower them to the ground.
Damn China made a treaty with Aliens
You Guys Are So Good At Lying - Hollywood Needs More Actors....
Where are those fancy great cameras that recorded the other tictac size things before. Let's shoot these things down after they record everything, and into the water. Geeze, they couldn't see the taliban driving into Afghanistan, can't see things floating into our airspace much less at hyperspeeds. Ggooo woke military.  Xiden and son, best investment China could ever make. I'd sure have some asses kicked out of command. Like Goofy, nope nope nope and they flutter along .
So...us and canda shoot down there own secret bigolow aerospace drone? 🥶
I loved how President Trump shot down Jim Acosta at every press meeting.
This guy on here says “F-35” when it has been F-22 that shot down every single object the last two week. Big mistake to make.
The reports are conflicting bc the bidumb admin hasn't figured out which lie to go with yet 🙄
That is not conflicting statements, that is simply statements of what each individual pilot experienced. according to this report.
Good luck on getting a straight answer from this administration. As far as our FBI and others concerned are about as useless as they are forthcoming. Unless Trump did it . Lol
Remember when CNN doxed a kid for making a meme?
They said Roswell was a balloon...
The fear in the US is understandable, the US government has done so much evil in the world, that they are rightly afraid of flying balloons. The Russians, the Chinese, Iran and who knows who are sending only empty UFOs for now, and soon they will also send loaded explosives of all kinds.
Alien is coming
Dollar General " Happy birthday" helium balloons.
Aliens?
Just kids balloons 😂😂
Prepare for the lies.
Misinformation. Some are saying it was moving 40mph.. truth is that it traveled across Alaska in less than 12 hours. That doesn't come close to adding up. Alaska is half the size of the conus. The bare MINIMUM speed it had to travel was over 100mph. That isn't a balloon floating in the wind.
Balloons don't disrupt things...look for another excuse government
CNN, why didn't you ask what it looks like.. how fast was it moving? geeeez...
Just how many Pilots?
Shooting down a UFO is very unkind
CNN is colon cancer
That fake ET 👾 invasion will not fly but they can fly,  can they? WW3 let's get it over it ☢️☢️☢️
It was just E.T tryin to phone home   Biden shot E.T's UFO down Wheres all the cry baby liberal democrat protesters at protesting that biden is racist...
Is that the guy from the HUNTING HITLER show??
Canada is secretly a communist.
Where is the Satellite imagery, where is the photos the fighter pilots took, tell the country what the hell it is and who is responsible.
It was floating, not flying. Just my option, if that's still legal to do
Alien warfare is about to begin and unite the entire world.  About time!
Maybe it was Biden's brain, are you really saying the most advanced military on the planet didn't know what they downed? Edit, ex Royal Navy myself, not sure of the idiot you have talking about the F-22, but we all know she can fly slow, that and is Piloted by the best the US Air Force can train.
There's something that bothers me. When the US shot down that massive spy balloon, the Chinese were pretty outraged, they claimed it was a civilian airship, and that shooting it down represented an example of excessive use of force, or something to that effect. But now, the Chinese haven't said anything. If the objects shot down over Alaska, Canada and the Great Lakes were just Chinese balloons, you would expect some form of reaction from Beijing. The White House and the Pentagon have also been suspiciously silent about the nature of these objects.   We know, thanks to the Canadian Defense Minister, that one of these objects was a cylinder, not a balloon. Now, I'm not claiming (without evidence) that these aircraft have an extraterrestrial origin, but if this were the case, I believe the public has the right to know, especially if we consider that over the last few years, the government itself has declassified footage of so-called Unexplained Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), which seem to match the description of some of these objects, at least when it comes to not having visible means of propulsion.   Bottom line: if it's the Chinese, demand that they stop sending aircraft over US airspace. But if these three objects didn't come from China, or from anywhere else on this Earth, organize a big press conference and just tell the whole truth. I believe that people are smart enough to handle the truth, no matter how strange it may be.
Not drone , Not a balloon , Chances is a  UAP OR UFO , I WONDER WHO ELSE THEY decided  TO MAKE MORE MAD
Could it be an electric or nuclear propelled Perhaps a unmanned remote controlled plane using a satellite for guidance
All  I know is….This shit is crazy and it’s probably just the beginning of something
If the video camera was invented they would have filmed it. All the confusion would have been solved.
China 🇨🇳 is trying really hard to get the US Canada 🇨🇦 and Alaska that’s how they got Covid over here now they trying hard to release something else over here
Not Alien for sure ya right they are just going to set there and be destroyed if is Alien they know what the he'll we can do
In a colder atmosphere, balloons fly lower. When it’s warmer (say, the Carolinas vs Alaska) they fly higher.
It was a tholian scout ship.
What are they trying to distract us from this time?
Late delivery from Santa?
UAP
It is tic tac ufo
The government must get us to believe that we are being visited by aliens in order to explain away the rapture.  See 1 Corinthians 15 and 1 Thessalonians 4.  Don't believe it.  When we who are Christians vanish in the twinkling of an eye, it won't be aliens, it will be Jesus Christ taking his church home.  BUT the government will say it was aliens.  And people will eat up the strong delusion, because they did not believe on Jesus Christ when they had a chance.  Believe on Jesus Christ and be saved now, while there is still time.  John 3:36 “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” (KJV)
I hope it is not Alien technology. They would not let us see their drones, unless they don't care any longer.
If the FBI is looking at it then we’ll never hear anything about it again
BS, Just a distraction from pedo pete!!!
Yes! Up there in the North must fly many, many civilian planes.
Guys don't worry it's just Aliens trying to leak the Superbowl script
Alien craft from the planet sirrus B
Perhaps the first balloon was Russian, trying to usurp the meeting with the Chinese and Blinkin.
Sounds like the government sent out emails to media to start covering this up.  We knew within hours what the balloon was where is came from it's flight path ect .. and it was still in the air. These two things shot down yesterday are being kept quiet for a reason.  The media already discrediting the pilots ect. It's shameful.
Hollywood needs to take back technuljii from Rossland world controller
Is this the last month of sanity
How about you ask where the damn footage of it is.... They recorded that shit for sure. Just like the navy the did back in 2005... Ya know that footage of them following that orb thing over the open ocean..
We are not alone.
Must be JFJK  Jr.  Finally.  🙏🙏
Yeah I'm confused she said they sent f35s up but the headline says f22s shot it down but no one knows what the truth is all we know is what the government tells us and I'm sure most of what they say is a lie
Part of the reason the pilots gave conflicting stories is because of the weather. Its foggy, cloudy, and snowy. Their flying by at high speed which gives them a brief second to get a quick visual understanding.   I dont think this is a UFO, capable of flying millions of miles,  but susceptible to being shot down by a simple missile.
Why won't anyone ask/answer "How fast was the object moving?". They had radar contact, so they DO KNOW how fast it was moving. Speed of the craft could easily out rule question of it being a type of balloon if it was going very fast.
I live in New brunswick canada and watched something last Wed or Thursday fly very close to a plane and almost mirrored the planes movements but had no sign of propulsion and the nose looked the same as the back of the thing
Keep a watchful eye on virgin Islands something weird with this situation
UAP UFO ...Here we go War of the Worlds👽
Maybe just a "bogey"...to divert attention and cover up what really others (China maybe) really is doing in other parts of the USA air space...
Just tell me if I need to quit my job that is all
We are only going to get the (edited) “truth” on this.
It's probably China or Russia using balloons or kites to probe the feasibility of weaponization of balloons and attack as the Germans did in ww2
If I was an Alien and I saw an F22 coming at me, I would crap myself…
Stop calling them Aliens please. That it racist they are "Intergalactic Migrants"
Sounds like a UFO
Shape shifter balloon.
I bet Jeremy corbell goin nuts right now
*Bullshit* _fighters are equipped with cameras_  are you trying to tell me there are no pictures?
Captains Log…stardate unknown.
How is it that the pilots have a job still when they are speaking to the public about what they saw?
mistakes were made
Don’t Irritate UFOs ?  How many of UFO sightings might have been similar balloons ? Roswell ? 🤔
The best thing the aliens can do is give earth a reboot, or in other words a do over.
Oh great we just shot down ET… 😆
ET's Uber ride has been shot down. Sorry dude, I guess your stuck here till your next ride. ET no go home, Elliot will look after you dude ☝️
The Alien Invasion (hoax?) begins... 👽👾👽👾👽👾
Apparently when it was hit it made a mysterious a high pitched whining sound.
You fools!  You started an intergalactic war!
CNN Breaking news. They send up all those F-35 Jets,(she did didnt say how many,like 5?) ,so 5 pilots all have there on version whats was going on. Still, 5 F-35 Jets ready to take of...PS. NORAD and the Central Command was involved . But hey,let the FBI take it from there:)!
If it was a ufo, like not from this world, we wouldn’t have been able to kill it.
Well, they just shot down another one over Lake Huron. Let's just start accusing the Government of shooting at "swamp gas" and "temperature inversions."
They are insulting our intelligence they are planning something because the corona virus didn't went as well as they planned so they are ploating with fake UFO invasions to create us new proplems I wish God PUNISH THEM
Why do Americans think they are the only people on earth?? It's not aliens...they would appear all over the world if it was an alien invasion 😂😂 It's china or Russia or both !!!
The US is lying about this object, they know what is it ,where it is coming from, and what it was doing there! I expect more lies from USA about this object.
Covid didn’t work so now they’re gonna try and say aliens are a threat to us and we need them to “save” us with a global order. Just watch
Some poor soul went astray and stumbled into our parallel universe thus paying the ultimate price
Um or it might not be from any country in the world period…
In the military, we weren't allowed to shoot a threat without confirming the threat first. So now we just shoot down objects without knowing what it is?🤔Geneva Conventions/Rules of war (IHL) getting real lenient I guess
We aren’t shooting down ufo’s.. it’s a man made something
Here we go, all the conspiracy nuts will have their "facts" and there'll be 3 aliens a wrecked space ship blah blah blah and there'll be thousands of yanks making money of off bullshit again
Majorie Tylor Goon know best about this flying things.
This is scary, and i'm shaking by fear
Maybe our traitors the insurrectionists have a bill to pass and its a diversion! shouldn't our traitors who are working with enemy countries be arrested and questioned at gitmo lets collect Majory taylor greene and laruar bobert , Paul Gosar and  steve bannon, Navarro and Donald trump they know something it could be North Korea DonaLD TRUMPS BOYFRIEND !
Sounds like a UFO 🛸 same description and detail of millions of other witnesses throughout history 🤔
What else do these "balloons" contain. Have we blown some kind of BIOLOGICAL WARFARE over millions of people and throughout our waters. They're not telling us everything.
👽
This is absolute bullshit.
Or the United States is just starting a flase flag operation to get public opinion into a war. Of course, we can't have another country be as powerful and financially secure as the US.
Is Bob a UFO nutbag?
WMD’s?
Yeah blame china...the one country US is in great debt with... just pay the man and stop tryna avoid paying back by causing war.
Ayyys
Remember the Maine?
8 Reindeer?
Gulf of Tonkin?
Until they decide what the last two objects are I guess we can say they shot down two UFO"S.
It’s all scripted.
UFO
Well remember that IKE send a U-2 over Russian just before he was scheduled to meet Khrushchev in Vienna in 1960s. That did not make a lot of sense. The meeting was eventually cancelled .
Former “CIA operative”, Boris.
This is the government’s attempt to confuse the American ppl . To cause doubt , when it comes to the ufo topic!
But just last week they said this happens all the time so if they are not worried why are they shooting them down now.
CNN is the fakest of Fake news lol
I would think that between the covid virus cutting through the country and their economy on the verge of collapse due to overleveraging to buy real estate when rates were low, China would be playing it safe.
Here's a little advice for everyone if the Chinese are going to spy on the United States they're not going to use a balloon the size of two school buses that everyone can see with the naked eye when they have satellites that can see as it on a gnat's ass from outer space. Number two all of this is nothing but I looky here looky here shitshow while they do something behind our backs somewhere else..... You can bet something big is happening but it has nothing to do with Chinese spy balloons..... And if there's anything real or extraterrestrial about what they shot down in Alaska you can bet the CIA or FBI will never let us hear about it
Doesn't sound like a balloon..it sounds more other worldly.
mysterious....no apparent propulsion system.....interference......object....flying round ..... if it looks like a )(*  and it flies  like  a  (&(()  and it is unidentified.... hmmmm   sounds like a U )(***
Some poor person just lost their Christmas gift drone.
Is there any possibility that this is extraterrestrial???
Pics/videos or it didn’t happen..
You would have to believe that the planes that shot it down also took lots of pictures, so the question is why haven't they released them?
Traitor Joe is doing his best to start a war!!
Maybe they will find a "made on Mars" stamped on it.
Wait until they send over their Stealth Balloons, made entirely from glass-fibre and Latex..!    In the early days of radio, if you examined the transmitter you could find the crystal, and work out the transmit frequency.   These days the frequency is controlled by microprocesors, and digital code, which can not be traced once the box crashes.   The best they can do is to measure the aerial, and calculate the frequency band, to within about +/- 30% accuracy.
Americans have cameras on  Aircraft
End of days, bible tells us of these things.  Fallen angels  are these beings.      They are here to control  humanity.     This is real. Government  hides many things over the years.       Jesus  is coming,  are you saved? Are you forgiven? Do you believe? What more proof do you  need?
It comes in threes this decade. A pandemic, a war, an alien?
If the FBI gets involved no telling where this thing will go. Depends on what the deep state has on its mind.
Natasha?
The FBI is going to investigate the debris? Isn’t suppose to be NASA scientists? I know, FBI is going to blame  it on Trump, a UFO collusion😂😂
I really want it to be aliens too. Ain't nobody but the Chinese... in my Putin voice. Lol
There are no UFOs. On hind sight, I strongly feel that all the so called UFOs spotted so far over America were in fact Chinese spy drones!!!
maybe we should concentrate on OHIO, and teh toxic event thats not being mentioned anywhere...  MEDIA complicit in denying life saving facts to people, there are charges for this behavior in your country I believe.
Yadda Yadda....Just Really as Sad as 21K, BigFoot & D Trump Being President, All so Full of Hot Air..!!  🎈🎈
New flash they were told to still lie on their accounts
Opinion news 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Natasha is hot!!! My missile is erected and launch ready😜
Two people always see  the same thing differently. That is why eye witnesses always have varying opinions.
These are Xi jinping birthday balloons, it has covid 23 virus as gift
UFO 🛸
Oh maybe it's a real ufo. Those have been around for years.
Look like this are UFO .
Bimbo CNN:  "...whether it's intact.."  It just got blown up by a missile and fell 40,000 feet onto ice.  Yeah, chances are it's intact.  Now go make a sandwich.

The US are going to start a galactic war, bloodthirsty savages trying to kill us all. It´s not enough to kill humans on earth anymore now they want ET blood. Spawns of satan
That's the new thing, aliens, make the great reset happen otherwise the aliens will get us.
Coneheads. It was coming from France
Do they not have video technology
UFCO  or unidentified flying Chinese object.
Conflicting accounts.  They got it on tape, they will analyse it.
Forget about war 3.    We just started a war with UFO

flying tick tacks ? Or maybe planet Venus reflecting off swamp gas in the atmosphere .......the military is good at putting out misinformation to cover there top secret programs.
They're not going to say it was a UFO but now we'll have to deal with a bunch of pissed off ET's
Saying the Chinese army acted on its own shows they don’t know what they’re talking about. China acts as one. The military doesn’t move without the government command.
GOD BLESS  THE U.S.AIR-FORCE AND AMERICA 🇺🇸!!!!! .SO GLAD WE HAVE THE "F-22/RAPTOR  BABY"!!!!💯☝️☝️☝️💪🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾
Aliens  👽 run 🏃
What's it? Remember history 1945 after Hiroshima  Atomic bomb What happened in the USA Unidentified object flying over Montana and other places around The world...hello Remember. Mission High jump? 1945. I believe? Lol This not  a joke. They are here 👽
China go HOME .
made the press release... but no who, what, why ...  sniff, sniff... smell that... stinks like a "false flag cover up"..  can you say : GULF OF TONKIN ?? !!...  yeah, I'm from that generation that lost faith in our government.. and hopefully the following generation from the " W M D" era will agree.
Not a good time to be a hang glider
E.T.
Because them Chinese now how to communicate with the UFOs
Conflicting reports ...here comes the disinformation...if we finally shot down a UAP...we need to know not another Roswell 😆
FBI fake business indeed, cia, certainly insidious action, let’s see how long it takes the corrupt legacy media to push the fake alien invasion narrative using blue beam, haha anything to keep their grasp on power
If this is more of Chinas doing, we should go to war.
Curiouser & curiouser !!
If it floats, pop holes in it and bring it down slowly.  Easier to examine it if not blown up
the main point is.. will the government reveal the object to the public.. showing it to the public ??? or cover it again from the public ???
Hey look over here at our made up bull crap so we can distract you from the most corrupt President in the history of the United States. Anyone believing this crap is a straight up MORE ON
What shape was it ? Was it like the tic tac shaped one the navy released info about year ago?
This "report" provides no conflicting information from pilots. Just because one person does not note what another person sees does not put a report from one viewer in conflict with the second viewer.  Another conspiracy thought up and fueled by the media. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
It is from here. No aliens.
Something really, really big is going down in the country and the world and it is not ballons, and we may never know what it is until it has been accomplished. If we are still here.
THEY ARE HERE 👽
Great, there goes the ride back to my off-world family.
CNN is garbage lol... this guy deflects back to balloons. It's clear that this is separate from the balloon incident.
Unless that object had a technical malfunction, there’s no way in hell that the air force could of shot down an ufo lol
China tested us and found us unwilling to defend ourselves. So they’ve sent more “balloons”.  War is coming.
Why can’t see the video
I confess. It’s taken 5 years to build and enter this object into our atmosphere. I can’t say where I live other than it is quite a distance from where the object/s were first spotted. I also am not permitted to disclose what sort of payload was on bored. I can only say that I would not allow my family to live in proximity of the object where it was shot down.
Could this be space junk
Guarantee theyre not gonna “find” the whole thing or it was “destroyed” upon impact or something else lol
Oh man... people have such constrained imagination. If it's not a spy device, then it's a a device designed to attract attention. Don;t forget that these days we get surprised by tech transforming our lives every year several times. They just managed to hide the propellers well, or they made it very light and it was kept up partially by buoyancy. It actually could be just an oddly shaped balloon.
I don't trust this transparency. Seems like a distraction. No way they'd have the capability to loosely disclose shooting down a UAP/ UFO. This is distracting propaganda. Or just inaccurate reports of another country's aircraft. Nothing the U.S. is actually surprised about, more like a trendy story to force onto the masses as a distraction
An yet no photos or videos but we get a video of the balloon LOL come on! Something is up.
look here!! UFOs  forget the congressional hearings..
The most basic thing is there must be pictures or videos ??  Care to show the public
Bummer you can’t fly a plane AND take a selfie with 🛸🙃
I'm not gonna say its aliens but.... its aliens
Shoulda sent Tom Cruise, just saying
PROJECT  BLUE BEAM
I guess they’re shooting down ufo’s now. Or so they want us to believe. 😊
🤔🛸👁️👽
P R O J E C T   B L U E  B E A M
It's prolly our own Black Market craft that U.S is testing. I also think the Chinese balloon wasn't as told by the mainstream media either. Any1 could have launched the balloon, maybe Russians trying to get China in trouble.
UNITED STATES NAVY   JUST SHOT DOWN A UFO.. AND ACTIVELY  TRYING TO HIDE IT ....
Yep, UFO. Good luck in retrieving the 'downed' object.
P R O J E C T   B L U E  B E A M
P R O J E C T   B L U E  B E A M

What if the Russians do it in a way that makes it appear to be Chinese?
next year we might even see reports of Godzilla if our recent years are to go by. I can't claim either way when it comes to things I don't know but I do know that media lies a lot
P R O J E C T   B L U E  B E A M
CNN IS THE NEW FOX
Why are they talk to a woman?
To all the comments of outerworldy origin. If this was something ET based then no jet of any country could shoot it down. A UFO of that nature would have some type of electromagetic drive that would cause multiple instances of signals in other areas. Therefore the more logical conclusion is its a sensor from Russia or China of sorts and they are analysing it. Not a good thing if thats the case. We are moving closer to an act of aggression or maybe even War. Any country doing this would initially cause WW3. no winners in that case, we all lose..
Notice how quickly the conversation switches to China and Russia. This type of United States mentality... shooting first then asking questions is going to destroy civilization as we know it.
FBI taking the lead , so much for the truth being told
Government (F)lying again.
How insanely ridiculous.  The narrative... objects unknown with highly advanced hovering, physics defying technology from an unknown origin shot down by technology that can't even leave the atmosphere of the earth...wtf!  Anyone who believes this narrative needs thier head checked by a clinical therapist.  You really think such an advanced supposed entity or craft is going to just either travel millions of light years or come through some sort of portal worm hole to just allow what would be the equivalent of a bow and arrow compared to thier technology to just shoot them down? What a f k n joke.  Wake up s. H. E eple!
Sounds like a snow job to me. Where's the proof. How bout a photo or video,,  or have the pilot draw a picture on loose leaf paper with a pencil. Don't believe the story folks. Just a bunch of crock !!! Head trip games, when people start talking in riddles, best to pay no mind. I have better things to do than read about this snow job.  🥴👍🍺🚬.,.
I'm going for the popcorn ! 🍿
Aliens
We're gonna fu*k around and shoot down the wrong "UFO" and start an interstellar war...
Like we trust the FBI. They will say it was a kid flying a kite and expect us to beleive it. I would trust my little dog to fly a plane before I would trust the FBI.
Lake Huron another got shot down hours ago
Technically UFO's
I can assure you that whatever it was did not interfere with the F-35’s “sensors” 🤣 media is full of shit and it’s all propaganda
👽👽👽
Hey that's my eskimo seal skin kick ball. After i kicked it so high i lost it and waited and waited then waited outside at -11f for 3 hours looking up the sky finally went in and the news said they shutdown a silverish object which is my ball bro lmfao jk
Anooooooooother today
It was the Tesla roadster…it came back…
So it wasnt enough for the US to bomb nearly every country on Earth, they had to go and shoot down one of Thanos' ships.
Nope. Freq. hop has been a thing for about 60 some odd years now.
This is a massive distraction
Now we know there are no UFO's.
Can be test runs for biological warfair. Cause infections
The problem here is that America is used to make war against villagers and sheep hoarders, maybe now you'll get a run for your money, i mean, your ''hard earned money''.
A fourth has just been shot down announced over lake Horan - Michigan
Alien craft with signage on the side that says "We come in peace" and we shoot it down.
IT'S   a  UFO.
Distraction from the Biden Administration. Possibly more huge distractions before 24' Elections?
A new script for Hollywood movie makers . Starring  old Tom Cruz without helmet.
My take is that it is again a Chinese craft. They are taking a page from one of our past previous actions we did.   If my memory serves me correctly, I believe during the Trump administration, the President was entertaining some foreign diplomatic people, and possibly Xi himself at Mar-a-Lago when we sent 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles destroying a Russian-Syrian airfield in Syria.   So if my memory is correct about that, it may be Xi launching all of these spy probe devices into U S airspace at a time when Secretary of State Blinken was set to be flying in.  It's gamesmanship in my mind with the additional punch of actually collecting data from the U S by the Chinese. One particular element which is always low hanging fruit is how fast, and when do U S forces respond to such incursions.   In addition in my opinion the main reason the pilots have not come together with some kind of unilateral identification if this current object is that if you recall when we shot down the Chinese Spy Balloon over the Atlantic waters off South Carolina the Chinese were extremely upset about it.   We may be trying here to lower the temperatures a bit by pretending to not indicate the Chinese again, and publicly classify that it will require investigation and we don't know who's it is, or even what it is.   I believe however we know it is the Chinese again, and while the craft itself may not be something typical or expected we'll certainly understand it's mode of flight, and/or propulsion.   It's important to note that this particular incident comes at a time during the incursions of all these other Chinese balloon types of spying crafts.  So obviously, it would be Chinese or even Russian in some sort if collaboration. Nothing shocking.   What's shocking is our passive handling of all this, and our non aggressive posture. I'm not a believer that is a good thing. We shall see. 🇺🇲🇺🇦    Glory to God, Victory for Ukraine, Rise Free Nations!
Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you gui..............
factual correction: plane was a F22, not F35 as reported here  jfc
I hope they didn't shoot down a tictac belonging to the aliens.
A whole lot a news ,but nobody knows anything,  or they're all lying
If it didnt "interfere" with sensors, you wouldnt detect anything at all... Media folks are a bunch of potato heads.
So they nailed a Tic Tac…. for some reason that makes me a little nervous. 👽
🛸👽🛸
MUCHAS GRACIAS CNN MAJOS LIKE.
China just watching this like😮(they never will know)
Big giant drones probly by our own they love to use distraction tactics some of these people in power are weirdos
You know its weird 2 days ago I see a bright light in the sky and it vanishes and now we have on identified objects flying around. What the hell is going on
Strange question:  do the Chinese have something equivalent to Area 54 with captured alien aircraft and perhaps are using alien technology in this mystery car-sized object?
I can see it from here, it’s called whole lot of balloonee
Some guy who made the objects in his garage to troll everyone is getting a real kick out of all this.
Shits gettin weird
More cnn fake news.  They didn't confirm any of these so called reports.
Scare tactics by both parties who cares fear nothing but God
So what are they?
Send balloons over Jina
I wouldnt trust the fbi looking at things.  They call parents terroists at school board mtgs.  This is just a diversion,  from all the stuff coming out of house investigations.  We arent going to war with russia. People open your eyes.  The demoncrats are worried about crooked dealings and money laundering. They are deliberately causing food shortages.
Ufos
I didn’t expect to find the truth here anyway
The collective West is sending the arms to Ukraine. The other side is sending the balloons and other objects. The balance kept. The public must stay scared.
I love how they spoke about what the pilots said but don't quote them nor share the recordings.
Attention all planets of the solar federation. We have assumed control.
She's Cute!
They all said fuck Joe biden when the cameras turned off
Could the FBI be trusted to do the right thing they ve been compromised just wondering
If these are other worldly UFOs, we aren't shooting them down. Think logically
ET?
She says F-35 fighter jets yet what they put on the screen says F-22 which is the raptor. Don't believe a thing they're saying. Funny this is happening as Twitter arrests are happening and Epstein's island flight log gets released
No wonder UFO sightings from pilots are filling folders in the defense department.
Shocked they didn’t blame it on Trump 😂
I don't care what they shot down. I just wanted to see Natasha Beartand~!
MAGA bitch!
OMG CNN actually reporting and not being a bunch of China cucks.
It's starting to seem reasonable that it's aliens.
Thanks Democrats
It's a UAP. China has had advanced propulsion systems all along and all the UFOs were in fact theirs. We might finally get a look at what that mysterious propulsion system that defines the laws of physics looks like. China was the first to come up with gun powder too...let's not forget.
1:25 Translation: UFO. It’s come to recover what we have at Area 51. China is helping… 😳🤨🤔🧐🫣🤭😁
Cylinder the size of a car? Hmm sounds similar to the look of a missile. A practice rocket from another country perhaps?
Ballons stay in the air because they are lighter than air. It’s not rocket science. Objects can look different from different directions, especially in a bright sky.
Why haven’t you gone to the boarder this year?
Why the heck not leaving them flying, follow their path and grab good photos and footage. Our try to catch one of them in mid air? Difficult and unpredictable i agree, but it might be worthy.
"I don't want to get carried away here..." (wink, wink...)" that might cause public anxiety..." and lots of clicks, of course.
conflicting reports means that a commanding officer got to one of them before the interview
Reviewing the debris will tell us about the designers of it. I wouldn't put it past China and Russia to have secretly discovered a way to take us out. This whole thing feels like it has been a long drawn out war against us.
It’s all lies
Or it's a China drone
The alians are coming back
Its a ufo drone, here to take Erik von donagen to orion.
I want to compliment you on actually having a segment where some nut- job has to come on & criticize Biden for not shooting object #1 sooner! Every station as been bent in throwing at least one Negative shot over the bough at Biden, so thank you so much for sticking to the fact that we know,how quickly we know them,  how well they’re doing gathering the debris! Even pre-schoolers know it takes time to put Debris back together while Analyzing every millimeter!
While the west has been busy staring up their own backsides, China and Russia have been getting on with the business of evil dictatorship. The West should already be on a war footing, united and ready for action. These are tests of North American Air Defense.
If Jesus came back in a space shit I feel sorry for him
Bread & Circus.
CNN will blame Trump for the Alien invasion that is coming!
The "UFO"originated in China,lol.Dont say anything,we don't want to alarm the public.☢️🇨🇳🎈💥
Let's see....we are on the Brink of WW3, and suddenly, this wonderful diversion happens?
We will probably never know what happened.
Time for a conspiracy theory I think. I'm fresh out of them though, anyone like to have a go? Makes me smile the thought that a USAF pilot has passed comment on this, it's all classified information - probably forever.
Lies Carry on with the strikes, dont be distracted
Hopefully it won’t start some kind of rebellion against us if it possibly was an alien craft that couldn’t communicate with us on peaceful means’  Maybe it was from another country spying?
Why don't we just accidentally released 100,000 half-a-million weather balloons over China and just as an accident and tell them they better not touch him or else that's an act of War kind of like
I recall a few years ago, the U.N. appointed an ambassador to welcome the visitors... https://youtu.be/-FxUVxd0sy8
What about Canada saying there was a floating house with balloons flying over Toronto?
Bob Lazar currently saying ‘I told you so’
Hope this doesn't cause an Alien attack
Have you ever read the book of Ezekiel
CNN is being blatantly vague,under order from the Pentagon
The government is setting us up slowly and brainwashing us for the day when a "alien spaceship" puts the world in danger. That's when they will take control of every human being the alien spaceship they're setting us up to see that's going to threaten us all is actually them that's how they will gain control.
Hang on CNN using ex CIA operative what the F? Something is wrong with this channel news thingy. CIA know nothing except telling Twitter and Face bo0ok to black list innocent people for telling the truth. Here we go again Truth not being told just words that mean nothing.
I, know who this  CNN reporter,  he's been found handled by the media involvement and the Leftists of the country,  just more about the Fake news report's,
"Obviously there was some propulsion system."  Not obvious.  Some pilots stated they saw no signs of a propulsion system not only in this case but in other cases.  The truth of the matter is that we don't know or may ever know where it came from and whether it is man made or extraterrestrial. While it is possible the object originated from China or Russia, it is just a speculation. It could be a U.S. secret project or even a craft developed by one of our allies.
And the shit that flys over towns.  Twit Havana again?
UFOs
It's the chinese people, cmon it's so obvious
It was Biden's laptop 😅😅😅 is what some morons will likely say
China now going up to shoot something down too.
Sounds like a diversion from the stark realities of the failed Biden administration.
Holup, are They saying that one of those tic tac flying things got shot down ?
Where's the "gun-camera" footage? 👀 Now we shoot down aliens 👽? We not gonna need to worry about China.
This administration is a shit show....
Pretty funny how corrupt stuff was going on with the FBI, and their the ones to get to investigate this? Haha ok then more lies to come yall
EUROPA TE OBLIGA A PAGAR QUE TE ASESINEN ELLOS AMORDAZADO HASTA AHORA MISMO COMO YO MISMO INNEGABLEMENTE EL COLMO DEL GENOCIDIO YA PAGATE TU MUERTE ASESINADO POR NOSOTROS LOS JERIFALTES SATANICOS GENOCIDAS MILLONARIOS CON LA MUERTE TUYA PUES SIEMPRE TE TENEMOS  AMORDAZADO IMBECIL DEJATE ASESINAR SUPERAS LA EDAD Y NO TE RESISTAS YA MAS CONTANDO LA VERDAD INNEGABLE QUE VIVES SIEMPRE ACOSADO Y AMORDAZADO POR NOSOTROS NO TIENES OTRA OPCION QUE GENOCIDADO AMORDAZADO DECIDIMOS NOSOTROS TU VIDA NO TU NO DECIDES NADA QUE NO TE ENTERAS VIEJO LOCO CONTANDO LA VERDAD CON NUESTRA CENSURA Y MORDAZA NAZI GENOCIDA A DONDE CREES QUE VAS VIEJO IDIOTA A MORIR YA NADA MAS QUE YA TE TOCA NO PODEMOS PARAR ESTE GENOCIDIO POR TI SOLO DICIENDO LA VERDAD CENSURADA PARA EL GENOCIDIO ESTE  SIN MENTIRAS NO LE TERMINAMOS CON LA VERDAD ES IMPOSIBLE PERPETRARLO Y NO LO VES FIN.
They're lying period..
Propaganda CNN
Time to go out and party .. cos we don’t have a lot of time left I’m afraid….things are definitely rapping up … there coming and nothing will stop them ..
I think it’s to draw our attention away from something else. False flag. Chances are slim we will ever find out what they were.....
And so it begins 👽🛸👽
Maybe it’s aliens 🤔
Here we go with the fake alien bs. Cue WW3 😑🙄
The object was full of hot air like Biden? I should have voted for President Trump. How could I let fake news CNN con me.
you report on this, but provide no proof whatsoever. Just show us a picture or nobody is going to take you tinfoil hatters seriously.
Acosta is a pinhead
If man was able to shoot it down. Then it was man maid.
Did the pilots happen to notice if the color of the object was red? Ya know, there's this old fat guy that lives up that way, that typically uses that air space in late December and he's pretty well liked. Just sayin'.
We spend a trillion on the military and we dont have a picture or a video?
No proof it even happened... Just govt. Say so...
China doesn't have no respect for Joe Biden neither. They apparently know more about Joe Biden than the American citizens. What could that be??  Beijing Joe Biden has a certain ring to it now.
Fill the strategic oil reserves.......quickly
Ufo 🛸  are too fast for us mere mortals to take out, aren't they?
They have no recorded evidence like the incident with the Chinese balloon, how do they expect people to believe it actually happened? Show us proof
It's pretty obvious Chinas not afraid of the us and will do anything they want.  Weak administration run by a loser
We are being played...it's not an alien, but people want us to believe it is.
What's that about an object going Mach 6 that was "shelved and figured out"?
I don’t wanna get too technical here…frequency hopping, thth the propulsion, there’s just so many questions here.” Thanks for not getting too technical.
Oh great now we pissed off e.t.
Probably just another weather balloon. They’ll probably send it down to Hiko, Nevada for analysis.
My fart speaks more truth than CNN
IT COULD BE (NOTHING) RELATED TO CHINA OR RUSSIA! MY GUESSE IS SOMETHING FOUND OUT ABOUT THE BALLOON SHOT DOWN AND SOMETHING IS WATCHING US NOT FROM THIS PLANET! NO ONE CAN ID IT, NOW YOU'LL HEAR ALL LIES FROM THE GOVERNMENT! I KNOW HOW IT ALL WORKS!!!!!!
J. Allen Hynek solved this mystery a long time ago: F22 pilot shoot down swamp gas ;)
fbi is for homegrown threats.hmmm us attacking the us
Will they ever show us the alien bodies?
Your lying Jim, same ole Jim just making stuff up,
Where is Trump’s spaceforce??
Mr beast or mark rober 🎈
China need to stop the games because if a us ballooon are any flying objects was in there sky they would do the same thing”
Starting to think the balloon was on purpose to make people conditioned to objects floating in our sky's / sightings
They’re coming. Get ready. 👽👽👽
And no one is talking about classified docs anymore, hmm!
None of the supposed contradictions from the pilots were actually contradictions. These yammering news idiots are idiots.
We must remember Trump started Space Force that allows tracking, recording, engaging, and shooting down all while free to openly talk and not classify the evidence. Keep in mind all this can be taken away. The public should be irate if there is collusion to hide the truth.
America 🇺🇸 wants the aliens ship and dead body displayed in 4k in front of the country immediately.
All I see from these reports and observations is an underlying common effort to not divulge anything.
The Chinese Government is probably sending these dumb useless balloons to cost the US money to shoot them down.
If it were an out of this world craft, they wouldn’t ever be able to shoot it down. It’s either china or russia
Something that's disconcerting and it's not really being mentioned that I've seen, thus far, is that this spy drone (that's most likely what it is) was flying right over or right near the northernmost end of the Alaskan Oil Pipeline and the location of the national oil reserve. So whoever is snooping there is likely looking at potential ways to target the pipeline, the oil reserve and rigs, or look for a potential staging point, since the area has an airport and a highway and it's fairly flat and barren in that area. The Dalton Highway that follows the pipeline is one of the few long, continuous roads that go straight through that area, down to Fairbanks, and beyond.
I'm looking at the use of a middle instead of guns , wasting money on a balloon very smart
It's a bird, its a plane.  Its a inflatable Japanese penis festival blimp
The government trying to start war.
Hope we haven't pi**ed off some alien civilisation by shooting down one of their 'Visit Earth Tour' vehicles
It was a covid x balloon
These are intelligent beings from another planet trying to warn us about our planet. Can't y'all see that. We need to find a way to communicate with them.
All BULLSHIT ... add sugar and salt to make it like movies.... AMERICAN Hypocrisy as usual...LOL ..after the balloon saga... more to come... please seat back and relax...TQ
Ufo
We better hope what ever we shot down doesn’t have friends
Mission wasn't classified genius
Clearly the cylindrical metal object was a weather balloon..
I can’t wait until they put camera’s on these 1 billion aircraft.
As much as I'd like it to be actual UFO/ aliens I really doubt it. My guess is some type of drone.
hm...maybe it was a T-90M turret? Noone knows xD
I hate this sensationalism.   “Dramatic”????
Who cares...America is the biggest war mongering corrupt nation in the world...
So if it's the size of a car ? ... Retrieve , reverse technology and let's start flying to work ?
Aliens are definitely going to side with China and Russia if we keep shooting down their UFOs.
Oh crap,sounds like the US just started an interstellar war!!!
Lose lips sinks ships! They know and we don’t. I’m ok with that.
If it was pink or light blue it could be a gender reveal balloon that got away.
They better do something and it better do it fast. Elon Musk he know what's going on. I know the secret. Joe Biden he needs to talk to Elon Musk.   This planet is going to explode. The trust is shifting. This earthquake was the beginning.
These have been reported by the Navy on both coasts. Spheres, cubes, tic tac’s, pyramids inside of spheres… Conflicting reports about what was seen…🧐
It’s an art to be able to say so little in the interview indeed! Nothing about the way it looked like nor about the speed and other characteristics. And, even more surprising, the host didn’t bother ask these questions either. Why???
Two objects about the size of a small car being shot down with powerful sidewinder missiles meant that little or no debris could ever be recovered to put the pieces together to solve this puzzle. Translation : the American government would never let the public know what the truth might be because that truth itself could cast a long, never-vanishing shadow over this particular issue of "national security".
the aliens picked this specific time to sent their probe to justify the need to purify humanity to their public. gg guys we had a good run 🥲
Swamp gas!
We'll all be interested in knowing what it is, so tell us when you find something.  Otherwise, anybody can speculate, and that's not interesting.
They've been slowly trying to break it over the thick skulls of the people for awhile now because it would break their world obviously 🙄
Why the fuck will they NOT say possible extraterrestrial.  After all, the last 50 years have PROVEN extraterrestrials EXIST.  My guess, it is, and we murdered an alien  - and as funny that may sound, it's also very sad.  Unless, YOU KNOW it's from a foreign adversary you don't shoot it down given the evidence that aliens EXIST!
sounds like a distraction
This is nothing more than a distraction to get you to stop thinking about all the problems in this country.   Also guarantee this will have something to do with China or Russia because Xi/Putin badman.
Oh, 👏  this was great, "experts" interviewed and saying nothing informative, overly knowledgeable or discerning. Absolutely nothing. Thanks cnn. Next time, interview me.
There is no UFO, yadada.  The US is playing UAV Balloon defense with the Chinese, clearly the Chinese can't decrypt some US classified information remotely hence they're taking desperate measures and sending UAV Balloons.
Sounds like a classic UFO case. No propulsion, tic tac shaped, just cruising at high altitude without any maneuvering designs, interfering with sensors. Unless it’s a high tech drone, I think the world is being prepared finally for the disclosure.
Come on, you are telling me that this possible surveillance crafts are more advanced than B52? Then it was an alien type ufo. Why so much secrets
i am afraid in this Russia Ukraine issue, countries might end up messing with big daddy(alien papa), and when they began, i mean you know to run for caves then......stop being idiots and stop killing aliens.  I am also afraid aliens are having tough times among themselves too, this is definitely not a good time to provoke them, entire humanity existence can be in danger.
Way to go US Space Force. 🤕
More fake news. The pilots would not discuss this to anyone in the media.
"no identifiable propulsion system"?  Like a balloon?  Sounds like a balloon...
It was reported in early February then hundreds of UFOs flew by the space station before they cut live feed
Doesn’t anyone else find it funny there was no pictures taken of this craft? There’s no no news coming in.
These things usually have "Made in China" stickers underneath.
1st. alien..... 'how do we stop these idiots destroying their planet with nuclear bombs Blap?' 2nd. alien.....'well Blop, we just need to distract them a bit'...
It’s an UFO and Biden shot it’s down. Area 54 and Roswell all over again 😮
Sounds like one of the billions of people on earth let off a big balloon that apparently prompted the usa to use a 40k rocket to destroy it.
Just the news milking a story for all it’s got. Everyone needs to take time to receive all the facts before jumping to conclusions
The aliens invaded. And they had to do it on super bowl week. We're the United States of America and we don't take that crap.
One thing for certain - no one would dare mess with us if Trump was in the WH.  But with feeble-minded crooked Joe (with China firmly in his pockets) - it sure opens up a world of possibilities for our adversaries.  Putin wouldn't have dared to invade Ukraine either - what you are seeing around the world is the deterioration of our authority and therefore diminishing world stability.
NORAD? Don't we mostly hear from them in late December? Is it Santa's sleigh, heading home late?
We’re about to have a Fortnite event real soon.
The former CIA operative looks very Russian - I guess that is helpful in the operative business.
And this is how the Alien invasion began!!
Their stories are different because they didn't listen well in the pre-interview briefing. There was no object, this is a hocus pocus spin doctor story, trying to make the balloon buffoon look good...
They fuckin lie. Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much.
China doing a lot of tests right now. They apparently test satellite guided lasers. People have observed green beams in the night sky. Purpose of that can only be speculated in but maybe they're also behind those UFOs tracking US navy? Maybe they have developed technology beyond what we are aware of.
You'll never ever get the truth out of the Biden ministration about anyting
Until the aliens announce themselves they're going to continue to get shot down 🙅🕺
Aliens
Ain't noway they had balloons all over they sky here in tbe US and the government don't know what or who it is and what's going on!
The CIA guy, Robert Baer, looks like he’s wearing a disguise 😂
Putin
CNN I come to you to laugh and find out what IS definitely NOT TRUE.
Aliens.
I hope you have jesus in your heart
Revelations
Where’s David Fravor?
I only turned this video on so I could give it a thumbs down because of this d******** CNN guy
No pictures were taken?  This smells wrong!
No propulsion system? Doesn't it make this a UFO? So, finally (or not) a UFO has been shot down?!
UFO
Will they really tell us anything except what they deem...stupid peasants
new generation of participants--some see financial gain, others do not know how to describe anything.  I do not believe it is more than playing operator at this point: words and sentences lost in translation from one person to another.
Its an Alien 👽 guys
ave those idiots just shot dow an ufo?
If they recover the wreckage and find an alien still alive in there. Noone will be able to communicate with it anyway, to find out where its from and what it wants. And itl probably die soon after... So again there will be more questions than answers.
Great are first alien contact an we already have potential sanctions from them good job america
It's a diversion to keep the people away from the esptein leak that's coming out put there minds somewhere else other than that

How did I know, ahead of time, that the war in Iraq and the take down of the Chinese balloon was going to happen? It was due to the many many contrails in the sky heading NE in the case of Iraq, and the many heading toward the east, toward the Atlantic ocean in the case of the Chinese balloon.  It's never normal to see multiple jet contrails going in the same direction at once.  So no matter where you live, and it's clear skies with multiple contrails, you know something is about to happen.
Perhaps it's too much trouble to release a picture from one of the six camera's on the F35?
Do you think… We are f$$king stupid CNN…  all my friends and family in the military say….. there is NO WAY, the pilots or any military personnel involved in this mission… are going to talk.  The is an appointed dept or person who will report to the public.
Basic probing tactics before an attack.
CNN fake news
Just an advanced UAV. That's all. Government is worried about the advanced military hardware we have. Worried about disclosure of advanced propulsion systems. If you think we've been relying on scram jets for 60 years you need a reality check.
winter storm, hadrcore snow, and fog, in the area now...
..sigh, i can't believe this stupidity and ignorance. even retired whatevers are not aware that CIA has been declassifying previously top secret UFO documents since 2012 .. are people really on path of ignorance and don't realize that extra-terrestrial existence on earth is no longer a speculation, but truth? CIA has literally confirmed that they are aware of at least 4 different extra-terrestrial species that have visited earth, but they think there's about 11. They also confirmed that Roswell was real and it was covered up.  why are people still so ignorant about alien existence? please buy higher IQ and learn that humans are very tiny and mean nothing to the universe, there are billions of intelligent lifeforms out there, it's very dumb and foolish to think that humans are only ones. in fact humans are still very primitive and low-intelligence. that's why aliens don't mind silly humans shooting down their probes (even if this wasn't non-human craft, they have shot them down in the past).  it's same princibel as humans would not declare war nor retialiate on polar bears if one would eat their spy camera that they use to document wild life. we are nothing more than silly animals to intelligent aliens. they probably laugh at human stupidity just like i do .. always fight war conflict shoot first ... just stop fighting and put your resources together and create something amazing.  has anyone ever thought about how much of all the earth's resources goes into offensive weaponry? it could be paradise on earth if all countries would just STOP with their fighting and share everything they have
China ,North Korea, Iran , Japan and Russia are so advanced than America .
It's all a  shell game 🎮! I wouldn't believe a  fucn word Costa says!
So,the FBI is called in on this, awesome.  We'll get from them, nothing to see here folks. That's a wrap. Just like everything else...
I think that provocation is the main event. The only way that Putin can hope to continue as the President under these conditions is if he accomplishes EXACTLY what he wanted to accomplish when he attacked Ukraine years ago! If we over react, we give him exactly what he needs to draw on his partnerships with our enemies!  No one wants a World War but we do have a form of it right now. We are being provoked by China or Russia in the same mode that the Japanese used by attacking Pearl Harbor!   You may hate Joe Biden and or the Left, but what you cannot deny is that we have not been baited beyond what we can endure!!
It's et yall
Conflicting accounts ? Isn't that CNN's specialty?
Did they just release the alien spores?
**FAKE**  How you know its all fake is pilots certainly would not be allowed to make statements in the middle of an ongoing investigation especially in a matter of this magnitude.
Things are getting very tense out there people.... I hope WW III isn't in our future but it certainly looks like it might be...

I THINK CHINA IS GOING TO SURPRISE U.S.A LIKE WHAT HAPPENED AT PEARL HARBOR
It was a Chinese sponsored advertisement for trump.
Of course the FBI and the Pentagon are investigating how to best keep everything about the UFOs/UAPs either secret or ambiguous to confuse the American public. I call for a total, regular, and timely exposure of their methods used and discoveries. After all, we are in a democracy, right, or are we in what Rightwingers deride as “big gub’mnt?” meaning impenetrable and overwhelming like, you know, in a theocracy.
Show us the evidence or it didn’t exist.
I'm surprised liar isn't saying it's Trumps fault.
It was an alien ship!! I knew it!!!
There are letting us know HOW MUCH AHEAD THEY ARE OVER US. AND SEEING WHAT WE WILL DO!!! SO THEY WILL KNOW HOW TO TAKE OVER US!
Alien false flag incoming.
It does say in the Bible that mysterious things are going to be seen in the sky
If we're so worried about China why do we allow China to buy up millions of acres of our farm land next to  military bases?
I THINK CHINA WANTS TO SEE WHERE THEY WANT THERE MISSILES TO LAND
This is 😂😂😂😂 just to buy the confidence of the us citizens… 😅since the balloon took too much time to shoot
Maybe we need a new defense department. I’ve seen these alien movies before and when the military is this incompetent it usually doesn’t end well for us.
Having a robot arm attached to a plane holding a Giant butterfly net to catch UFOs has never been more possible
This whole thing is bizarre 😳 💀 😐 and needs investigating.
Why does cnn keep referring to spy balloon as “Chinese” spy balloon? Wasn’t that racist ? I remember a clip of reporter questioning President Trump about “Chinese” virus?
The military should have been that fast on 911 smh 🤦 ijs
I saw one of these balloons a few years ago.
I love the lack of info..almost seems planned.
I don't know about what others are thinking but I believe China is very interested in our defense system & are probing us everywhere to see where our weaknesses are etc... considering what is going on right now with Russia & the Ukraine... the ongoing war in Syria .... it's seems logical that China may be looking to make it's move on Taiwan right now & looking to test the United States reaction to their probes... the fact that they aren't saying much about it or releasing videos or photos makes me think this was another spy balloon or a more sophisticated version of this spy balloon..
With the FBI involved, nothing will get done! The FBI is the most messed up organization in America, the White House should be letting the military handle this!!
Seal: look guys, i found a hockey puck!!
X-files.......let's not get silly here.
It was a small flying car... #ucking mistery solved
The only way they would tell us if it was aliens is if we were going to find out anyways no matter what, like for instance an invasion.
They shot down Santa
It’s a gender reveal party balloon going too high, ok?
Why wasn't homeland security doing the investigation in Alaska
It clearly is not aliens... Its time travellers now they are stuck in 2023
🛸🛸🛸👽👽👽
It’s a set up - seriously like this hasn’t happened before - don’t believe it normally they would keep this quiet
Roswell 2.0 Saucer downed, "Oh, it was a chinese balloon." Blame China for everything.
It was a redneck in a lawnchair suspended by 1000 party balloons with a cooler of beer.😁
I don’t get how stupid we can be??? If we don’t know what it is our answer is to shoot it? 😂
BS!
Someone call FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, asap
https://youtube.com/watch?v=jtZGKYO7iyI&feature=share Is this it?
Can we just release a projectile based net from a higher altitude and capture it ?
Nobody asking the main question. The FBI will be investigating this! 🙄. They lost a laptop for Christ sakes! 😳
Soon we will be convinced to give up on our freedom, in exchange for security and protection from “aliens” that may or may not exist 🧐
It’s probably what Bob lazar  was working on
Well it's not a worm hole.
It's not that hard to say what it is...
SHOOT DOWN ANYTHING THAT IS EARTHBORNE VIOLATING ONES SOVEREIGN AIRSPACE BUT I DONT THINK ITS WISE TO JUST SHOOT DOWN ANYTHING UNIDENTIFIABLE 🤔????   WHY MAKE ENEMIES OUT OF POTENTIAL FRIENDS ???    just saying??  maybe it's time ??  Do you people really think that the pentagon and DC and Langley have our best interests at heart here ???  THEY ALWAYS ALWAYS KNOW MORE THAN WE DO  --  JU$T ASK CNN
Man is it aliens or not?! 😂
Could be a Russian drone.
THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE
UFO 🛸!!
The scary part would be a balloon loaded with bio weapons. The fact that China can get them here without us even knowing is frightening. A balloon going mach 6?!?
BALOONS ? Just Duct Tape a paint ball gun to the nose a wonna those  F22's , pop-up there , en Smack'em !  That'll learn'em !  Oh,  use red,white  &  blue paint !
This is all too public for my liking. After covid I do not believe the media one bit
Here we go. Aliens is their next play!  Not surprised 😲
Once again, the government making a big deal out of nothing.
Balloons ? So wtf is the balloon for ? How stupid is our Defence military
How can these two miss the obvious point.... Chinese have found a way to overpower the US defenses... They are testing right now... Before the great war begins! US would be dust if China had nukes and US did not.
It was a sled, and the propulsion method was reindeer.
UFO
Obviously it's the Kanadians. Spy probes as part of the Kanadian invasion of the USA. Southpark predicted the rise of Trump to the presdiency and they ALSO PREDICTED THE KANADIAN MILITARY INVASION!!! Never trust a nation that pretends to be really nice.
UFO🛸
With the strong confident bumbling of the commander in chief, I feel really safe! Elections have consequences.
At least we know, according to the US Government, they don't have shields as they did on Independence Day!
go back to your living rooms sit down on your couch and keep watching the film on your screens that you are playing your part in as an extra....we are now on episode 2023 and it lasts until episode 2024..in this episode its where they convince us extra terrestrial are real..something weve all known from many years ago..they will probably appear from somewhere on earth where the average human being cannot go...somewhere remote like antarctica or alaska so we wont see them coming..ever watched a film and you know whats going to happen??
Personally, I find it sad and frustrating to have listened to an opening statement that it is not truly covered in the report: For instance, this news commentator began saying: "But now we are learning that US military pilots who approached the craft have given conflicting accounts of what they saw."  However, when you listen to the report it only mentions of possible subjective experience different pilots may have felt when approaching the object. This is why I truly feel that all children going to primary school, high school or college should be required to frequently read:  "You must not spread false stories against other people, and you must not do anything that would put your neighbor’s life in danger" (Leviticus 19:16 NCV). Personally, I truly feel that we just need one out of five people believing in God to be committed to promote and to teach other Americans with their words and actions God's commandment asking us the following: “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor" (Exodus 20:16 NKJV); we also need them to be committed to teach others by words and example the following command from God according to the Bible: "You must not cheat people, and you must not lie to each other (Leviticus 19:11 NCV). After we get only one of every five people believing in God to be praying and working to have Exodus 20:16 to be well known and accepted in the minds and hearts of all Americans then the business of fake news will be out of business. 😎
Strange how they ACT like they are letting us know something
Poor aliens
Mmmmhmmm yeah ok………..
Blue beam project
Bunch of bullshit !! Liers ! Staying 40k feet in the air? Interfere with the aircraft controls ? Is it a ufo or yall fucking around
Another roswell cover up coming up
Anti gravity has been around since the 1960's..
No one: Politicians via News Media: “Look over there!!”
Really like they would tell you what it is more bull 💩 !
Definitely ALIENS
Can someone else say ... Aliens
Having been shot down by an F-22 at 40,000 feet I can guarantee you ma'am that it is definitely not intact!
hope this was a balloon and not the tick tac, we really don't want the unknowns to get mad with the earthlings.
They showdown a Chinese pilot, that's the cover up, no UFOs
Did he say they saw an object going Mach 6 and they just shelved it. Sure they did I don’t trust anything they tell us I’m sorry. The end of times is here. The world not believing in Jesus. Gay people being promoted like it’s cool and not an abomination. More and more of natural right’s being taken away. Jesus is coming back I’m glad I’m saved
They shot down an alien tour bus.
Hope you humans are ready!
I have to ask, as a South African looking at this, Does the American military really use pilots that they can not believe when told something, or cannot identify an object going at high speeds? Isn't that crucial in a military situation to be able to identify an object or atleast give more information in a situation like this? But all I hear is pilots being "confused".
The object was traveling very slow. I read that 30-40mph...
So , it belongs to a category of UFO.
Global warming/ Climate evaluation And sampling comes to mind, maybe satilite signal boosters??  Or   Do the Chinese know something about outer space that we don't???  UFO??  Alien monitor -ish???  I mean probably not but open-minded thought is important to keep the big picture in mind
Maybe they ejected from the object...they could be invisible...if so they're among us.
Covid plandemic is now failing, people are waking up. Quick, cue  the staged UFO alien invasion or start a war.
Disk shaped object with two cylindrical projections above and one below  ....  Capt Christopher
We are being primed for another weather balloon...
You mean hear what the CIA wrote for release to garbage media like CNN?
FBI taking the lead?  Great, now we will get real dis-information.
I don’t know who I trust less CNN or the government. There really ramping up another war the war machine needs to get back in motion
Seems fake as fuck. Can’t trust america
Whats going on🙄in this country, a lot strange things happened🙄 ?
Sounds like a case for Bob Lazar and area 51
NOPE
This is pure BS propaganda… Who is gullible enough to fall for this nonsense? Chinese Spy balloons, mystery objects…  As an ex Marine and my father an ex Air Force F-15 pilot, they would not speak out on this stuff as it’s classified. A Chinese balloon wouldn’t even make it close to our airspace without being identified and shot down. $800 billion a year spent on air defense
Funny how china made the virus and now acting all crazy.   But they won't come to America. If so they want a fight then a fight we will give them for sure
Where’s the video then?
The object is a extraterrestrial drone that was dropped off by the UFO that was seen over Russia last week near where Putin was giving his speech. This UFO was seen by several people and 2 Russian jet pilots. The UFO had several changing colors when it changed altitude...
Come on, the Chinese aren't going to send something else over right after the balloon, it's clearly an alien craft. "They don't know how it was staying in the air"? How does something exist that can stay in the air and the US military not know how?
While people are fixated on the new propaganda campaign, they can't see how Russia is kicking the umpire's a$$ in Ukraine.
Sounds like a cover up and BS excuse on the horizon.
Jesus is coming! Be ready!
No one would give details about how effective jamming is or isn't
So, this happened for real.
Bring on that Swedish guy on ancient aliens with the weird hair for more commentary.
Klatu Borodu Nindu They came to take back Marjorie Taylor Green. Or it's Elon effing around up there, again.
Strange that no mention of speed or maneuverability…
I assume they were instructed to dissemble.
Bring in Mulder and Scully.
What I’m afraid of is if the balloon carried some kind of bio materials like virus etc to spread in the us! Very scary! If it’s destroyed what if the material is exposed to the us air! They did it in Covid-19 and failed to destroy all humans so now this is their second project?
Jesus is coming back This world is running out of time  more weird things to come to stay tuned & get to know & give ur life back to our Creator   YOU ARE NOT YOUR OWN.... you are His, His Breath in You're Body is His. This World is fading
This is all a distraction from Biden first fuckup
They're Here
Dear US military people. Please don't fucking shoot down alien crafts in there. We have enough shit going on already. I don't want to witness an alien invasion.
The best way to keep public in the dark is to hint at something else, but not confirming it. Something mysterious, spooky and exciting is a great subject to capture peoples attentions at the wrong answer. I can't imagine how many times the US government have indirectly used UFOs and aliens as a scapegoat. And people eat it raw, because they want to believe it.
Wow. China also has alliances with alien forces like the US.
here come the aliens
😍 f22
That object disrupted a billion dollar fighter jet’s sensory system? Has to be an alien lol
UAP
Jim, I loved you with grey hair! Go back! It’s was naturally sexy. Brown, no good! You’re a silver fox!!
I don't believe anything CNN has to say. Their ratings are so down that they sensationalize anything for good ratings.
Until we get its fuckin pronouns right I don't think we'll be getting a word out of IT!  It might be a rumor but I heard it had short pink hair and a bullhorn! You didn't hear from me ok
It was a UBER eats drone, it was bringing my Hunan Chicken with Mongolian beef!
Is it UFO?
You mean the U.S owned unidentified object.  Dude why do they still get away with this nonsense? They tryna sell this war were about to go into and all i can say is get your bug out bags ready and stock up on canned foods and mre’s
Hate to bust everyone's bubble but the alien threat tactic was always in governments cards to use on the public. Notice china is now doing the same thing. Its a psychological operation. If you have a sliver of belief in ufos 🛸 then you should be aware that they are ours. Because they crashed in roswell and the coverup was history (ironically a weather balloon they said) this all smells to high heaven. If i had to guess i think the axis and allied factions are aligning and we are going into a hot war and they're trying to keep the people calm by confusion rather than admit weapons are being deployed. In the last 50 years when has anything been "shot down" by fighter jets? Never. Not even on 9/11! Let that sink in the fighters that day weren't even armed. and now in one weekend 3 air to air missiles deployed in North America airspace. Wake up people get prepared
What Generation aircraft are space aliens flying these days ?
Silly primitive and stupid people, it could have been an alien craft, but most of us are believing in comicon, and Hollywood that your mind is dedicated to pure stupidity. God is real, He created all visible and invisible.
oh, no big deal. theyre just describing shooting down a ufo that's all
Bruh what it’s aliens not Chinese. Then we’d be really fucked
NORAD should not be letting anything into our airspace.  Canada is also part of NORAD. It's dangerous & embarrassing.  China should not own American Farms. Our food supply is in danger. No Tech companies should sell anything to China
Another cover story to help explain away the real UFOs
The moon 60000 feet
Lol "listen to what we made up about top secret stuff"
The Xenomorphs could launch a full scale retaliation offensive. Humanity is ready to accept the truth that they exist.
I’m sure the jet have a video camera
Covid, WW3 and Aliens
If they are shooting down objects that are not identified as from one or another country? I can only wonder if we are being pushed to believe in something that is not happening in the near future with the sole purpose of unification of the world governments into one. And stopping this war , which will soon spread to the world. If that is happening?? We surely are dumbasses for picking fights with something we can't have victory over. Regards LB
Ufo.
It was Superman;s Bat Jet
There’s a new one over Lake Huron, big NOTAM issues for the area and more fighters inbound
these objects are how trump is selling his stolen secret docs to russia and china.
Release the pilot’s video photography
The US space force
what happen if they carried a nuclear bomb. Maybe it was a test :)
How do they know it’s even Chinese?
China said that they had a unidentified object off the coast of China today or yesterday?
it was joes new piggybank send in by chairman xi.
This should be called LNN , LYING NEWS NETWORK.
This is CNN so don't believe everything they tell you.
Come on man. These 5 Gen fighters have cameras. Let's see what it looked like
Crazy how this only happens over North America
This is disinformation to keep us off the balloon. I bet we learn very little about this funny how they have so many I witnesses so fast. It's kinda like the movie shooter almost !!!
Nobody better than Jim to talk about a big bag of Hot air.
UFO 🛸
Looks Like It Could be Roswell All Over Again!
These people are such bullsh.ters. They could release pictures and video. This is for their failure for not catching a balloon.
Smelling. Psy Op:  the timing of these objects appearing and being shot down is sus.  Feb 2 : Chinese balloon seen over America, it’s a large balloon easily visible, and has no on board propulsion, just floats carried by wind currents. China says it’s a normal weather balloon, US says it’s a spy balloon designed to spy on military targets but doesn’t shoot it down until it crosses the entire continental Us. Maybe it is maybe it isn’t maybe it does both.  What we know is China took no effort to hide it.  Why didn’t NORAD see this sooner they track space debris as small and millimeters. “NASA and the DoD cooperate and share responsibilities for characterizing the satellite (including orbital debris) environment. DoD’s Space Surveillance Network tracks discrete objects as small as 2 inches (5 centimeters) in diameter in low-Earth orbit and about 1 yard (1 meter) in geosynchronous orbit”. From NASA  So we know they have capabilities to track a large slow moving balloon.   Then with in two weeks suddenly there are two more objects that they shoot down. But now instead of balloons they are saying these are no man made and there’s no images or footage of these objects. And we’re supposed to take their word that they had no visible source of propulsion. Just like the other objects that only military pilots see in action.   Seems to me they were priming the public to accept things being shot down and f22s overhead.
Joe says the aliens are only looking for a better life,😂
They are messing with us…..  obscuring, to take the attention away from Biden’s negligence. I trust the CIA guy implicitly..
You can't even hear Kennedy's speech on You Tube anymore... (Censored)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em8cuv_a0gU
No one believes anything from CNN.
Yet more mis-information.  Unpowered at 40K ft.  BS.  And an ASSumption that it came from China or Russia.  This should make the cover of  BS Today.
What can get up to 40,000 feet, (in those winds), be cylindrical, the size of a car, not have any visible form or propulsion (or wings)? I've heard similar descriptions from service members before... 🤔
I didn’t see any photographs on the last one and it isn’t a balloon so it might be a story to make people think Biden is being proactive now?
This was also shot down by the Canadians over Yukon, Who's lying ?
I still dont believe the FBI on the balloon yet..
We have some spooky airframes and I’m sure the Chinese or Russians do too.  Could be one of those or…  could be the originators of said technology that we copied.
What is going on here? Objects here Objects there Objects everywhere 🛸
ET
Wag the Dog.  We are now at DEFCON: Alien Invasion.  What y’all sheep think is left?
Someone at Area 51 done left a hanger door open
Is CNN trying to report news without saying trump and republicans are bad?  Wow. Maybe they are learning how to be adults. Good for them. Always interesting to see a group develop their brains to think for themselves a bit.
First story is the truth. All others are the official cover story.
This isn't helping. You're just encouraging conspiracy theories
I find it hard to believe that F22 pilots, CNN hosts, military corespondents etc., are not as informed as I am about modern dirigible technology.  There are all sorts of commercial and military aircraft you can just find here on Youtube if you want examples.  Rigid bodied, dirigibles with sleek designs that can conceal propulsion systems into the body design.    Here's one from CNN, 10 years ago...  TEN FUCKING YEARS AGO AND SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC.  NOT A SECRET https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ha1V6wR8_E  This country is embarrassing.
Wouldn’t trust anything I hear on this pro woke channel. Is this CNN dribble supposed to mean something?
Please. This is NOT human made. NOT from China or Russia. This is not about any borders we, as humans, have made up. Remember, we as species are still like newborn babies compared to whom made this high-tech. Don't spend more precious time gaslighting people. We've known this would happen since the fall of 2017, so tell us the truth, we deserve to know it.
What's a dinosaur to do when there's unidentified objects...on the ice??
Bruh... He's talking about if these are Chinese or Russian, but the pilots can't even tell how they're flying? If they're Chinese or Russian made were in trouble then because if we can't even tell how it is staying in the air by looking at it, they have some insane tech going on.
Oh and CNN they always tell the truth about everything too right
Once China has 6G (which its military almost certainly already has) the US armed forces wouldn't stand a chance! China will never attack the US, (why on Earth would it, when it's so successful with its trade initiatives) and only has one overseas base, as apposed to the US's eight hundred or so. China also has the most sophisticated hypersonic defence capabilities in the world - if the US ever dared to try to attack China's mainland or Taiwan, their fleet would very quickly be at the bottom of the ocean! The US armed forces couldn't even defeat the Vietnamese, what chance would it have against China? Well, I think we all know - none!
Sounds like a UFO to me. Let's hope a violent reaction didn't send the wrong message.
What is really going on? A lot bull crap
It was a guy in a lawn chair tied to 50 helium balloons. 😋😋😋
Wow, pilot can't described what they saw, eventually it shoot down the object
Oh gee that is really good that we have the FBI to investigate this because they are so reputable and trustworthy thank God
Those aircraft took high definition pictures and video before they fired so all the bullshit about we don’t know what it was 😂😂
Bullshit
Alien drone.  Military should go live during these…
Great! We shot down aliens and we're about to get our as$es whooped.
If they find anything their just going to hide it in Area 51 with all the other UFO crafts and dead Alien bodies!  🤣🤣
The last two objects are ufo's ....Not balloons. Aliens have been visiting us. The Pentagon won't tell us the truth.
And pay attention to what happens with the internet if it's just more biden's Mickey mouse bulshit the internet will stay up and run just fine , if it is a real threat the internet will go down in a heartbeat they will shut it down immediately
This clip does a great job of explaining nothing.
This reminds me of the scene from Major Payne when one of his cadets was scared of a monster being in the closet.  He just blasted the closet with his gun until the child was satisfied.
It seems we’re probably confusing Chinese spy balloons with  Extra dimensional/Extra terrestrial spacecraft.
Alien war 1  has begun..  but lets be real its time to get tough on China and bust that ass.
All of South Carolina probably have their chrome dunce caps on.
The aliens are finally here!
There are quite a few hobbyist balloons floating around at about 40,000 ft.  In winner time, the prevailing winds tend to drive them up near the North Pole.  Those balloons typically transmit beacon signals on internationally recognized amateur radio frequencies, however the military might not be monitoring amateur radio.  An Internet search for “amateur radio balloon” will offer up a lot of results about what is currently up there.
What about the classified documents found at Joe's place? There is nothing new about the Chinese spying on us. Let's get back to the possibility that Biden will need to be impeached.
If this was a test to see what Americas reaction would be to an aerial incursion, judging by what happened I would have to say we were caught sitting on the pot with our pants around our ankles, while reading emails on your phone. Fumblemania, fumblerooski, fumble-aya.
Fake news
BS LIES
I bet this is some sort of odd aircraft that is experimental.  The Russian experiment with very fast craft and very slow.  They built a plane in the 1950s  and 1960s that is regular airplane sized but goes about 60 miles per hour.  They also experiment with lots of EMP type warcraft devices.  Conficting stories were told by the US military when Russian aircraft engaged USS Cook a few years ago about how the ship was temporarily disabled.  It could be a Chinese, North Korean, Japanese or Russian test.
John F. Kennedy on Secrecy:  "The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and secret proceedings.  We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions.  Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.  That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control.  And no official of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know."  For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.  It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.  Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed."  "No President should fear public scrutiny of his program. For from that scrutiny comes understanding; and from that understanding comes support or opposition. And both are necessary.  I am not asking your newspapers to support the Administration, but I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people. For I have complete confidence in the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully informed.  I not only could not stifle controversy among your readers-- I welcome it.  This Administration intends to be candid about its errors; for as a wise man once said: "An error does not become a mistake until you refuse to correct it." We intend to accept full responsibility for our errors; and we expect you to point them out when we miss them.  Without debate, without criticism, no Administration and no country can succeed-- and no republic can survive.  That is why the Athenian lawmaker Solon decreed it a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy.  And that is why our press was protected by the First (emphasized) Amendment-- the only business in America specifically protected by the Constitution-- not primarily to amuse and entertain, not to emphasize the trivial and sentimental, not to simply "give the public what it wants"--but to inform, to arouse, to reflect, to state our dangers and our opportunities, to indicate our crises and our choices, to lead, mold educate and sometimes even anger public opinion.  This means greater coverage and analysis of international news-- for it is no longer far away and foreign but close at hand and local. It means greater attention to improved understanding of the news as well as improved transmission. And it means, finally, that government at all levels, must meet its obligation to provide you with the fullest possible information outside the narrowest limits of national security...  And so it is to the printing press--to the recorder of mans deeds, the keeper of his conscience, the courier of his news-- that we look for strength and assistance, confident that with your help man will be what he was born to be: free and independent."
FBI taking the lead? Give the American people a break!!
Perhaps the disclosure of this kind of information is a part of a "softening up" process to the american/world public. Perhaps. If "we" keep seeing story after story on what the general public appears to think are reputable news sources, then disclosure of interplanetary contact might be less frightening, when it does occur.  The narrative in the media is almost, but not quite,  matter of fact about these encounters. The people are taking this rather well, just like we are being trained.   Keep watching, they will tell us what to do and how to feel about it.
Oh. The F-35 is too fast for pilots eyes to see properly? GTFO, these guys are jokes and know nothing
🤣😂🤣😂  Ya know.... at least the propaganda is entertaining this weekend!!   This is a decent episode!!
Hopefully us dumbazz humans didn't just start a blood feud with Jupiter....
few thank goodness he wasn't technical
Some pilots, exactly which pilots and now opinions on what is going on. How about our government makes a statement?
The USA has the right to protect our airspace from any aircraft. With the hostility of other countries to the our country, Biden was acting on the side of caution over placing our country in danger.
Just like if there is a hurricane or or volcano or earthquake getting ready to happen animals act funny pay attention to them
Alien: Take me to your leader. Leader: dribble dribble drool poop drool poop you want ice cream?
CNN STILL SUCKS!!!
"ALIENS" -Ancient astronaut theorist
😮
I think that our pilots could give a reasonable account. Sounds like a lot of bullshit. Was it a balloon?? Was it a aircraft of some kind??? Why is this such a topic of discussion!?!?  Does anyone else smell that? Smells like a mountain of bullshit!!! Blah, blah, blah......
Col. Jessup : You want answers? Kaffee : I think I'm entitled to. Kaffee : I WANT THE TRUTH! Col. Jessup : YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!
How do we know it’s not filled with Covid or Bird Flu germs?
Geee why would China allow their infected people to ride international flights all over the world…makes no sense to me😮
....waiting for the connection to Donald Trump........
Click bait! We were supposed to hear what the pilots saw but all we get is stupid speculation by some "expert"
I think that our pilots could give a reasonable account. Sounds like a lot of bullshit. Was it a balloon?? Was it a aircraft of some kind??? Why is this such a topic of discussion!?!?  Does anyone else smell that? Smells like a mountain of bullshit!!! Blah, blah, blah......
That stealth fighter looks like an alien to someone from a couple hundred years ago... who knows what's out there that we don't know about
Another ufo but this time we shot it down wow, can’t wait to hear what it is when they find it…
Number one how are all the major animals acting right now
I hope they didn't shoot down an alien air craft with some greys just cruising to visit some friends.
Aliens man, aliens.
You notice that all the fighting connected propaganda news sources are the only major contributors to all this propaganda pay attention
So there aren’t any cameras on these planes or pilots?
Maybe a UFO or UFP? This might explain the secrecy.
The pilots have not spoke yet.  Seems to be misinformation
This story is going to require the level of journalistic sophistication that falls right within my wheelhouse. It's going to take an expert to solve this one. ☝
Size of a car? Didn’t Elon Musk launch a roadster a few years ago? Maybe it’s back.😂😂😂
Tic Tacs
It was Marvin the Martian,,,, and being shot down made him very angry,,,, very angry indeed….👽👽👽👽
swamp gas
Fake news.
Can't we just drag the objects down instead of blowing it up?
Okay. I see. So the US Strategic Air Command is using the prior Chinese air balloon incident as a way to sweep popular suspicions about UFOs under the rug so that we'll just write those encounters off as "more Chinese balloons" from now on. Like that cover story for Roswell.   F*****g brilliant guys! Bravo!
Oh my God CNN can you stop lying for 1 fucking second? I am suddenly reminded why I stopped watching Main stream media
Why is  the FBI investigating and not the army Corp?🤔😮‍💨
UFO.
ET
WTF,  they shot down a Chuck-E-Cheese baloon ??  That must have ruined some little Eskimos birthday party.   Did it rain down candy ??? The baloon clear said Happy Birthday Tuquluk !!!
Sounds like they shot down one of the "tic tac's" Lt Commander Fravor saw in '04 & talked about on Rogan's podcast. Multiple, incredibly reliable, cream of the crop type pilots have been seeing these things, since the early 2000s, & opening up about what they saw. They're probably around all the time & we just don't notice. Who looks up in the air for long periods of time?? Plus the human eye would have trouble seeing something silver at that altitude... 😳🙄🙄😳👽🍄🕉😉
WTF kind of reporting is this? Were they shot down by a F-22 or a F-35? "Some pilots", how many exactly? Where are these reports coming from? This is useless....it leaves more questions than answers!
The pilots can now speak out due to the open freedoms of the navy recent changes in ability to say what they saw, and experienced, indifference to the old officials who would lie, and spin the coverup stories that are being spoken about! The stuff that is being said is in line with many of the experiences that has been told for many of the past 50 years, maybe longer, has pilots tell of the same events when encountering these crafts, even when they were called foo - fighters! I now see retired generals saying " let the military speak on this, and the politicians shut up"! That is the old guard who wants these cover ups to continue the denials, rather than the truth! I have worked outdoors for 25 years, and have seen many different types of crafts. They are here, and there is not a damn thing we can do about it!                 Peace!
GD I was interested in this subject but I can’t stand this idiot Acosta…nevermind
Great.  Even the aliens know Biden is weak.  Now it's interstellar conflict.
Beijing Hoe Obiden flat out ALLOWED the first CCP balloon mission.  These later balloons are just staged to cover his tracks.
I've been waiting for them to pull something just like this I knew it would come
The "craft"? A balloon isn't a craft, a cylinder isn't a craft.. it was flying under its own power?
Get the pilots on joe rogans podcast and let them tell the real stories.  Not CNNs
Well if it's a alien craft we have sent a great signal by shooting it down nice work 👍
They're here.
This is the 3rd ufo object they shutdown today
This might be a provocation from Russia: they made a cylindrical balloon filled with helium to mimic the tick-tack UFO that was publicized some time ago.
Brian Williams Vs Lester Holt @ WRESTLEMANIA
Don't believe any thing CNN reports I would suggest another network  other than Mainstream networks.
More like something out of the bidens file
"I don't wanna get carried away but..."      Why don't you go ahead and inflate the situation to get as much mileage out of this story as possible before anyone actually knows what is going on?     The media should be put in charge of the Fed...they can get more out of a single word than my momma could get out of a pound of hamburger.   Imagine what they could do with a dollar.
I was joking about this.... But maybe they actually did take down a UFO....
Letting the FBI analyze something like that is a joke🤣🤣, who can trust the FBI nowadays?🤔
Intergalactic war
Could be from North Korea with help of Russia and Iran.
The last two objects are ufo's ....Not balloons. Aliens have been visiting us. The Pentagon won't tell us the truth.
I Say Just let them be Known Already. Whatever or Whoever it is We’re dealing with. But of course. The People are Too Sensitive for the Truth ! & the Government probably Feels it’ll Loose More Control of the People 😵‍💫☠️😓. I’m primarily Up for the Acceptance of Whatever We’re unknown about.  👽✌🏽😊💙
Utter horseshit.
Wow just more of the same with CNN misdirection and fear mongering. How is it they still haven't figured out how to give an honest report on something. And F35's? Really? Are you sure about that? I believe the White House said F22's.
FAKE NEWS! The US Military nor The US Government would release or de-classify ANY communications for public use.  Absolutely pathetic you are CNN!  Stop your BS?
Fake fake fake
The object shot down was the Russian collusion flying bus from (duh) Russia!
We have been doing counter intelligence on these for atleast 2 years. I believe we have gathered all we needed to know, now we make it public and shut the program down.
Perhaps its NOT OF CHINESE ORIGIN,  or perhaps  not of terrestrial origin.
Balloons don't have propulsion systems these guys are better than scammers
Why the F.B.I dealing with a national security manner? Shit weird
Be Prepared For the Worse.
The truth is out there.👽
sounds like damage control for the beijing biden regime disgrace and the shame anger resentment this clinton crew administration cant deflect after continuously taking a knee to chinese interference. seems like something sellout joe and milley and hunter hatched up back at the clubhouse, figuring it would show strength and sophisticated defense based on offering the exact opposite. least they didnt try to pin it on trump yet.
Hopefully it’s aliens and we can end the wars and fight em together.
All these balloons more likely are old and they’re losing control of them here in the ground, more likely are either from those two countries, Russia or China. I can’t believe the pilots are talking about missions like this, because truly scared people the most and all kind of stupid theories about space beings in our skies begin to surface.
It's just a propaganda stunt for the new season of the X files
What if the object is from alien?  What will be the consequences for that ?  (BTW, China currently also find an unidentified object in their air space)
My guess it’s the Chinese again , but I really wish it was aliens from another solar system so they can help bring world 🌎 peace to Mother Earth 😊
emp incoming
Alien war!
I honest to god 100% do not think it was an alien space craft. For starters, how would it be able to get here and then easily be shot down?
Ufo lol
Squirrel 3!!… That’s a kill!
Limely the Object they shot down could be the chinese surveliace balloon we all have heard about, the Aliens on the other hand aren't dumb enough to get "shot" by the military's primitive weapon system.
This is a diversion. Stay alert
If CNN has the audio from those pilots, it’s b/c the government wants to gaslight the people! Oh wow isn’t Biden great, oh wow aren’t our military generals fantastic oh wow ( fill in)……… except  that our pilots are idiots
It’s a shame nobody has any answers we all heard it’s this it’s that’s the public has the right to no.
It happened to us, while leaving a transgender party 🥳 drunk, we saw the object not sure what it was.
It’s CNN… fake experts and made up officials. Come on man
What’s bozo Acosta still doing there…heard he was on his way out the door.
I believe the pilots. This other man is clearly lying.
What is this reporter talking about?  I think it's a "Manufactured Story" based upon some trivial misstatement.
Lol I know they're not trying to say these balloons are the UAPs pilots have been spotting through the last few years.  Do they really think we're that stupid?
We have been lied to for so long that when we get just a small glimpse of what really goes on it seems like a science fiction movie... We don't really control our government people!!! We are controlled by what we are made to believe is a government and have zero representation... Kennedy said long ago "The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and secret proceedings..."  The struggle continues!!! ;-) Truth is out there but we'll never know it from our Government!!!
Why isn't the DOD being upfront and informative...  Is this Roswell part 2?
Why would the goverment even say anything if it were aliens
Did James T- really manage to get Captain Christopher back to 1969?
Stop with the conspiracy theories it's a balloon not something from outer space
Aliens!!! - ancient aliens
No pictures of it on the ice??? Weird . Super sketchy
China has 300 satellites in space and they can pick up a number plate on a car…….why would they need balloons
it is a probe for an alien invasion , lol
Please explain to me why they are flying fighter pilots when they can shoot those things down with a laser.. From anywhere in the world my guess is to make it look better and to add a little more depth into the bullsht story.. Project Blue beam 100%..
Uh oh!! We have an Ice Station Zebra situation!. Get Rock Hudson outta the public baths and into cold weather gear!!
Natasha looks fresh and tight.
Don't trust our government
I could’ve been at a BBQ
A big plume of pink... It was just a huge gender reveal balloon. 😁
I hope they are not spraying any biological weapon on us.
“Change the story, change the lead.” What he means by this statement is to distract the media from the recent scandal by presenting something else for them to report on.
Amaizing how this is all happening with grandpa Joe in the white house LOLOL They said this happened when Trump was in office but NORAD said that was a lie. Trump has balls, would not tolerate any of this and our enemies didn;t fukk with him. cause we all know if anything like this happened with Trump??? CNN , MSNBC would make you hear it 24/7  for a week! NOW Russia has a target on us cause Genius Joe blew up their pipeline......Just wait.
It's Ozzie, judging by the altitude.
Blah blah blah garbage lies
Elon it’s time to pull off the mask.👽😱🌎
I know what it is. It's a flying thing that came from somewhere. Mystery solved.  You're welcome I spent a lot hours researching to provide you with that information
I cant imagine it being alien, to small and slow, and shot down, unless a sort of drone.
Testing delivery systems for something?  What would a rival country want to deliver????  Doesn't take much imagination to come up with way too many possibilities...
_No obvious means of propulsion._      *March 16, 1965:* At approximately 6:00 P.M., central standard time I was standing in our yard near the porch in front of our house when I noticed a strange looking craft about a half-mile away approaching from slightly south of east. Aircraft followed a regular route north and south, but virtually never flew east and west. This craft appeared to consist of one or more rectangular metal boxes stacked upon one another in the center with smaller rectangular metal boxes abutting it on each side.  It had no wings. That is the way it looked head-on as it flew towards me.     The only sound that it made was a gentle swishing sound similar to that of grouse gliding through the air. When it got closer, I noticed that this craft appeared to be made of brushed stainless steel with a slightly reddish glint. The sun had not yet set. No lights, no moving parts, no emissions. It was about two and a half times the size of an automobile. The front sloped downwards from the top, two-thirds of the way down to the bottom, with a profile similar to early 1990s Ford minivans. Glass extended from halfway up to within an eighth of the way to the top. At the time this craft did not appear to be saucer shaped, but that might be because I was viewing it head on with the play of light and a slightly rocking motion making it look like rectangular boxes pressed together and piled upon one another due to minor surface variations of rectangular sheets pieced together to form the whole craft. _I retained a distinct impression of its sharp angular design, especially of the seam that separated the side from the front, with no attempt at softening its features, as if it were a prototype._     My mother was at the clothesline about 200 feet away.      Two men dressed in white uniforms were standing inside the craft and were on the side nearest to me about midway between the front and the back in a narrow corridor that seemed to go all the way around the craft behind which was a bulkhead that reached the ceiling so that you could not see all the way through to the other side. Their uniforms were like those worn by American military officers, plain white tunics without any insignia and they were not wearing caps. I was left with the distinct impression of them resembling fine-featured Englishmen. The attention of one man who seemed to be operating controls at a console that was hidden from view beneath the level of the window was directed downwards while the other man looked outside. The craft flew within fifty feet south of me at an altitude of about 400 feet at its closest point. The man looking out the window drew the other man’s attention to my mother who was hanging clothes at the clothesline. The craft came to a virtual stop as they gazed at her when one of the men glanced up and spotting me watching them, reacted like he was startled, alerted the other man and the craft sped off at high speed beyond a grove of trees and was soon out of sight.     _That this happened two days before the first space walk on March 18, 1965 enables me to establish the date._          Latitude: 52 degrees, 7 minutes, 21.1008 seconds North  Longitude: 100 degrees, 45 minutes, 3.96 seconds West
It’s nothing more than  the Beijing Hoe Obiden staging this merely to cover its tracks.
I'm sure the gvt will tell us the "truth" if this aircraft is extra-terrestrial 😂😂😂😂.  In 1947, it was also a balloon 😂😂😂
It’s funny to me that they’re using the term “Chinese” spy balloon.  Yet these same people lost their minds when a certain someone used the term “China” viruse.  Anyone else see the hypocrisy?
Threat to Civilian aircraft:   interference?? are they threats to military aircraft? i thought 22's had stealth tach incorporated   .....it's  something man made ,not alien yall  Russia and China minus Iran messing the NATO alliance  ......"go fast" that's alien .. that has to be China doing the sonic attacks ,it may be a 5G wireless transmission ,where are those droppa stones now ,when they are spinned around at certain speeds they create frequencies ,it may have been weaponized creating those sonic attacks China?? haaah???? ....has anyone discovered the cause of the (Havana syndrome)???
@MunroLive  I try to read and scan as many of the comments on your videos and a few others online as much as possible and I gotta tell you, 99% of the population even you guys that are supposed "experts" really have no idea in the world what is "really" going on or won't admit to it.   You gotta subconsciously KNOW the American Government, legacy automotive sector and the oil 🛢 industry is owned and operated by literal NAZIS of ww2. I use nazis a lot as a general umbrella 🌂 term but honestly, you do the research you find out that is literally true.   You get up here on YouTube like you are some big wig old school automotive engineer and maybe you were but while you were busy trying to figure out ways to save money 💰 on a fcking fastener, your GOVERNMENT in collusion with the legacy oems was purposely preventing and suppressing battery electric vehicles from market and hydrogen technologies from market. You refuse to touch this reality of truth with a 100ft pole with a lame 4680 d cell battery 🔋 attached to it.   I am FURIOUS with not only the ill informed public but the supposed EXPERTS that get on YouTube blowing smoke up everyone's azz about what "really" happened the past 100 years.   It's a sick, twisted story of my country and its dirty corporations and you were part of the scam on the American people...  Good Luck in Texas with the classified defense sector actor known as Elon Musk...  If one of these fusion labs goes balls to the wall Elon Musk is screwed, he had better adopt and adapt to the hydrogen technology or he is gonna have all sorts of tomatoes 🍅 and lawsuits thrown at him for his lies 😉
When are they going to show what it looks like, you corrupt Devils
casing out ...case the joint..all im sayin
After the flack the biden admin got from the last balloon and as many conflicting stories on this one. It wouldnt suprise me if our own government was behind this one.
Almost as MYSTERIOUS as HUNTER BIDEN'S Laptop's and the 'BIG GUY'S' 10% kickbacks ......... huh little jimmy  ?
So.... we have been seeing these strange objects for years now and they usually just deny them , but all of a sudden they are shooting them down!???........   Something doesn't add up here?       SETUP FOR SOMETHING
What I don't get is that we don't have some kind of telescope powerful enough to look at an object 50-100 000 feet in the air, and see it like we're looking at something from 10 yards away with a naked eye. If we can look through James Webb telescope 10 billion light years away we should be able to see stuff few miles above the ground.. I'm not saying it should be the same telescope but the military should have something of the size that fits on a truck that can be positioned right beneath the damn thing and watch it from the stand still position, not zooming by it at 500 knots..
They won’t speak on what they actually saw
Just to be clear...this report is about the second object and not the third?
I feel great now, the FBI/DNC is taking the lead on the investigation!
Stop shooting down the visiting aliens! 👽 😭😭😭😭
Lol make believe. Come on ppl lol.
Can’t believe this doofus still has a job
@MunroLive   consider this...  You can prove the military industrial complex of America 🇺🇸 in collaborations with some nasty Soviet Russians and Nazi Germans built some very sophisticated quantum compact hydrogen fusion water reactors that could be "tuned" to quantum transmutate elements. In other words "quantum alchemy" quantum hydrogen nuclear physics research.   In other words locked up somewhere in classified defense or aerospace sector is a literal "gold printing" machine... its actually a quantum based nuclear hydrogen water 💧 technology.  How curious 🤔 would it be if the United States 🇺🇸 Classified Defense and Aerospace sector has a technology like that but have remained "quiet" about it, possibly for decades? Always bragging how they can easily turn on the money machine, 💰 🤑 💸 🙄 while simultaneously lying and stealing the money 💰 back from the stoopid citizens in the form of taxes and carbon scam penalties.   It's highly probable a few countries are in possession of a technology like this...or a compact quantum hydrogen plasma based nuclear fusion reactor that is just as good as a gold printing machine. Limitless heat, electricity or lighting   If average Joe's could wrap their brain 🧠 around what that means and how treasonous it is to the citizens....  If you think your government or the war machine military would not hide a technology like that from the people for as long as possible you are sadly mistaken...they used the classified nuclear side of hydrogen technologies to kill you the past 100 years instead of help you. One "truth" I seem to have a hard time getting through to people. YOU USE WATER 💧 ELECTROLYZERS TO BUILD NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND REACTORS  Umm your government and war machine organizations been creating nuclear arsenals using WATER 💧 BASED hydrogen technologies, instead of using it to save the planet as a clean fuel source. You let them all kill you with hydrogen water technology being "secretly used to manufacture nuclear weapons" 🤣 then they also sell you evil oil 🛢 toxic oil 🤣 to kill you more  Please wake up...
America will lose this war in Ukraine, as it has lost many wars. the crazy elite of American psychopaths will not be able to do anything. Russia's nuclear triad will win anyway....
read the materials composition
they're really really gonna play it's an unidentified object holy shit that's a joke
[FAKE NEWS!!!!]
We need to start uncovering the mysteries of the galaxy
Can someone explain how we know this is from China?
No cameras available to maybe take a picture?
It doesnt matter how fast the jets were flying it should be easy to identify if it was a balloon, if its something else they might never admit it.
Nobody loves themselves some Jim Accosta like Jim Accosta loves his self some Jim Accosta
👀
🤦🏻‍♀️ threats to passenger jets should be the least of their concerns. The idiots on high let a whole enemy nation spy on our whole country for a whole damn week. Oh, and then they later admitted they weren't able to jam the antenna used to spy on American citizens, not at all what they originally claimed 🤷🏻‍♀️ now our enemy knows where our stuff is and what we talk about; but oh yeah, worry about an unidentifiable object cruising in civilian air space. What idiocy 🤦🏻‍♀️
What? Two independent human beings had a different POV about a balloon? Definitely worth interrupting regularly scheduled programming. Slow news day? Sigh. I miss the 1461 days of the Trump Administration....even the slowest of slow news cycles would have been filled somehow with some negative news piece about Trump. Before you internet surfers start screaming at me.....yes I know what I just wrote is a Non Sequitur....but it's Super Bowl Sunday.....and couldn't give a hoot about football
I hope they are checking the debris before touching and collecting it. What if this is a way to spread a chemical or virus. It's an easy transport method. The collector is infected they spread to their families then they spread it and so on. I mean we saw what COVID did.
Can anyone say, “PSYOP?”
Click click click!! Distraction! Distraction from real American problems!! Not real news
The Truth is Out There! 👽
Image it's someone school project 🤣 and we all though it was aline 😹
This is clearly Trump's fault
Now we will have war with aliens 😂
[FAKE NEWS!!!]
So, if this thing was so sophisticated that it didn't appear to have any propulsion system...why was it so easily brought down?
Balloons don’t need propulsion they float
Alien invasion.....
Great. The Stargate program was testing a Death Glider, and NORAD didn't get the memo. They shot down Teal'c.
Release the gun camera footage. That's all that needs to be done.
Mr. President the objects were not of this earth. We may have started an inner galactic war. Biden: I quit, I’m not dealing with this malarkey anymore. 😂
They need to release the video of the "object(s)" as they did with the Chinese balloon.
It’s just a huge drone! With visual decoying to make it appear dif at dif angles. This has been going on for decades and I’m ver6 happy they are finally shooting them down!
We all know it’s UFO or back engineered machine. So shut the fuck off and let the people know.  All these mainstream medias are now taking it serious after ridiculing so many people and evidences for a long time.
Apparently Reagan's message to space didn't mention they could just walk in at the border🤣
[FAKE NEWS!!!]
Why the hell would the examination be done by the FBI instead of military intelligence? That makes no sense at all.
More deep state distractions. Next they will tell us there are aliens invading earth. Keep your eyes on the Biden laptop, Epstein flight logs, Durham, and the collapse of the U.S. dollar.
Well dun sleepy joe you shot down  aliens    If you don’t know what is  you don’t know what’s comeing. Now  you not see next time
Why being investigated by the FBI? Because they've performed such wonderful jobs protecting Hunter Biden, HRC, and the DNC? We have more, qualified investigative specialists in the armed forces than in this, biased institution...
You would think they could mount a camera somewhere on a billion dollar jet fighter so they can show us. It's not like we didnt pay for this jet.
It was George Jetson coming home from Spaclys Sprocket
Probably because the blue beam animation laser guy forgot to include the propulsion system in the software..lol they can't even get that right..
[FAKE NEWS!!!]
They just saying it’s mysterious because if you try to hold that one country accountable their just going to deny and or blame the US. It’s just a misinformation war.
Why is it still an object???
No pictures = fake news
deport illegals
Gee. I really do miss the days when we didn't have China invading our airspace every other week.  I'm sure it has nothing to do with our weak leadership and/or politicians that have been bought and paid for.  😂
PS: While I do believe there are people who have had legitimate alien experiences..it hasn't really been determined what they really are. But when cnn presents it, you know it's some sort of manipulation, bc thats what they do.
YouTube won't let me say ( phake knewz. That should tell you everything you need to know.
UPDATE!!!  We know nothing about anything…  It is a thing that was in the air.  We shot it.  It is not in the air.  Back to you Tom…
Dang the our government can’t cover anything up anymore.
An instrument issue could've been isolated and merely a coincidence as the other pilots noted no interference.   If it's a strange shape and colour balloon, no propulsion system would be evident.  I only care that we're re finally punching back at the nations who want our head and continue to disrespect us
[ FAKE NEWS!!!]
Lol 😂 yea ok 👌
Of course the fbi will take care of the narrative. What could go wrong?
Next month from the media “why war with ch and ru is good for you” 🤡🤡🤡
I hate these news reports. They are basically reporting to our enemy what we know and what we do not. I prefer the shut up method which is 1) Remove any immediate threat 2) Learn about what it was, how it works, and its intention 3) Respond to its country of origin with your own offensive move. Then 4) Maybe use media or maybe not depending on situation at that point. America is too defensive heavy and even that is showing not effective. What America needs to be is more offensive and more blatant about it. Send some stuff over Beijing skies and see what happens, take notes, repeat.   Quit claiming you (the US) have the best military and intelligence agency in the world based on your ridiculous spending and actually prove it. Because in case it STILL isn't clear - you have enemies to the East that don't think you do.
Et go home oh no
You Edomites have Hell to pay for crimes against Humanity…
Chinese ccp commy flying crack pipe 🚬👻👽 rice 🌾,rice a Roni the San Francisco treat!
it isnt china, china is a long way from alaska, more likey to be russia or aliens than china in my mind
CNN now starting the Alien collusion hoax
You have pictures of the jets but no pictures of the object quit spreading bullshit already
Joe Biden is a Chinese Asset Democrats are the Party of Brain Dead Communism
Wonder if it's a small hybrid dirigible.  If it's unmanned it could open up a ton of possibilities for something light with little power requirements. I've been curious about toroidal hybrid dirigibles, if anyone has made anything in the shape sweet spot between volume and aerodynamics for lift and drag. Some hydrogen filled tentlike mylar structure with a small battery and fans, maybe a small solar panel for trickle charge. I'm just a moron daydreaming on a toilet, tappy typing my musings while doing the business. Curious what they'll say it is.
FBI lies so much you will never know the truth
Just know we the public are not stoppid, and want to know whats really going on. We want an explanation not lies
It’s a ballon party…. Meanwhile chemical weapons are being used by Ukraine, Sy Hersh published an article outlining who did what to nord stream and the number of countries dropping the US dollar for intl trade grows. Russian gdp grows by 2.4% while the us flatlines… gonna need some clowns to go with the ballons
I think this is propaganda for certain reasons by US this was to be made up to avoid war with China since they are stil trying to focus on Russia. they realize it was a mistake of shooting down the balloon so now they are shifting the focus from China baloon to object.
It's nice to know that the Americans have finally perfected the technology that they stole from Germany maybe now they will have the balls to admit where this technology came from and that they stole it from Germany after World War II
So a first contact space ship coming in to say hello and we come in peace… and Biden shoots it down?? Damn liberals 😂😂
I’m not saying it was aliens, but it was aliens.
Ease it in USA ease it In..........
Distraction everyone focus on balloons
Cnn fake news
What do you call a plane with no wings?  A cylinder.  How do planes fly at 40,000 feet without wings?  They don't!  Cylinders can't fly!!  Wtf is going on. 3 objects in a week and the press had to pull it out of the government. So much for transparency.
I mean damn do they tell the truth about ANYTHING.... LIKE ANYTHING
Cover_up yet again!   Approaching an actual disclosure soon.
How about show the video footage from the pilots jets, & let the American tax payers decide for themselves what the supposed ufo is. Idiots!
They wouldn't talk. If they did that would be there ASS.
Analyzed by the FBI, oh we should get the absolute truth then if that’s so.
Never mind war with Russia or China, ET we should be worried about.
funny they brought up the x-files as there is an episode where a UFO is parked under the water near Deadhorse Alaska....
Y’all ready 🙌🏽
CCP did the balloons because it's an act of war against the US started 70 years ago. Americans and the west must wake up now before it's too late. XJP ordered to send the balloons. Don't be fooled by his lies.
If it was a small UFO. Then the government will hide the truth like they always do. They'll that it was something else.
They’re really dragging this story. Let’s get back to Biden’s son and scandal.
They know what is they just can’t tell us .
I, for one, welcome our new alien overlords.
This was a UFO... Unidentified aerial phenomena... This is crazy I can't believe this is happening something is going on behind the scenes ladies and gentlemen no propulsion system?
Último minuto!!! Xi Jinping dice que él también vio un objeto volador no identificado en la provincia China de Shandong
As ever something else to scare the US public with, and create a new bogey man, to justify the money being given to The Military Industrial Complex! Are Americans so dumb that they believe all this ludicrous rubbish? It's laughable!
I hope it was aliens. We really need aliens to save humanity for warmongering humans.
The ones in Alaska & the Yukon were the Baby Trump blimps. When a MAGA individual sees it they get triggered and see something different from non-MAGA individuals who just see humor.
Natasha Bertrand can get it
When does CNN start blaming Trump?
Are you still with CNN? SHAME
I’m not saying it was aliens….but it was aliens 👽
It’s very weird when we already Been told that “THEY” (WEF) is gonna fake an Alien invasion and now this which to me seems like more acting then anything on these news anchors part ..
It’s a ufo bc they are here all the time.  Be ready
The pilots that saw it would not be permitted to comment to the media.
what rubbish the hole thing is
The objecthad Happy Birthday written on it.
Lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies
I'll start the conspiracy theories, the item shot down over Alaska was a UFO with and ALF on board. Prove me wrong.
Why are the FBI looking at it. Why not the military?
Natasha way Hot🔥
X-COM, baby! Skyranger was already dispatched. Watch out for Terror Mission reprisals!
I genuinely hope it’s aliens
We don't know anything, they only tell us what they want us to know. The media can't be trusted any more then the biden administration
I wonder if this is how they are going to open up on the alien thing?
Your CIA spook is downplaying and CNN is very sketchy @jeremycorbel
Wow, if balloons are  coming in into our territory I can’t imagine other things can come in  We don’t look too good
Firstly, it's not Russian technology. The Russians are a systematically corrupt nation, especially their armed forces, through all the ranks. They don't even have the money to keep tanks, aircraft carriers, and weapons maintained during an active war. Secondly, I don't believe it is the Chinese either. If they had secret technology to spy on the US, then why send low-tech balloons too. In my opinion, it is US tech. Either made using black funds, and a secret to most US officials, whom then shot it down  unknown to them it is a friendly craft, Or this has been the perfect opportunity for the US government to secretly reveal this new technology.  But let's be grown up here. As much as I would like it to be aliens,,,,it really isn't.
It's a UFO 🛸 just say "it's a ufo"
Don't make a stink out of the pilots' differing "opinions".  Different people see unknown things differently.  Investigate the object and THEN report.  By all means dont' get carried away.
BIG CAP
Maybe the ballon was a distraction. And this other object was the actual threat. Who knows
CNN and its anchors are bigger liars than the Demoncrats in D.C.
Seems to me they are probing our sensor range and have stealth capabilities to scramble our plane's sensors.  Intentional or perhaps a beta test?
They are here....
Ground Control to Major Tom
She’s alright.
This illustrates something police departments know (if they're honest)...eyewitness accounts are almost never 100% accurate, different people will see different things.  Individual confirmation biases (based on individual experiences), and perspectives from different directions can lead to very different interpretations of the same event.  The classic example is blind men describing an elephant.  This is what makes our current polarization possible.
Only two thing's it could be if it's not our aircraft. #1-Another country's aircraft. #2-Aliens/ET aircraft  It isn't that hard to use common sense.
As long as nobody is talking about the congressional hearings going on, everything will be alright.
We need to get a hold Captain Stephen Hiller!!!!
The news went from talking about all these classified  papers being found in politicians house to  the Chinese , Russians and Aliens are coming
From ufo to uap to ufo again I wonder what a uap information will pull up after foia
They saw a blur as they whizzed by something blowing in the jet stream as they traveled by at hundreds of miles per hour.  They all interpreted the blur differently.  This is not unusual.  The Air Force/Space Command spot an unidentified object every few days.  Then they tell us something or nothing about it months or years later.  It been happening for nearly a century.
Either CNN is lieing  or some pilot just lost his job. What do you guys think?
And We The American People will Never Ever be told the truth on what this was.😠👎
* balloon *
It’s all BS. Only a fool and idiot would believe anything these people say!
From what is being said here, looks more and more like a decoy to reduce our vigilance in future.
I know for a fact that aircraft does exist that can hover with making any noise and have no visible means of propulsion. I know this because I once saw a swarm of such aircraft in the night sky glowing a bright amber color just floating over me a bit too close. It could be something like what I saw but if it is, what I don't understand is how those responsible for creating such an advance machine could allow it to be shot down.
Lies!💯
oh great. the fbi. notorious for lying to America.
I feel like we are in a movie these days!
Natasha is a good communicator
The aliens are working with the Chinese
Funny how the town/harbor name is kinda like the Proudboys and it EVEN adds up to the same Alphanumerical number as China spy balloon!!! Who would’ve ever thought of that special connection, these folks are smooth!!!😂 it’s all a psyop people and when you turn on cnn, you SeeNotNews
A few nights ago a Chinese satellite was flashing green lasers at the ground on the Hawaiian chain. It might have gone unnoticed except for the fact that it interfered with the studies being done by the telescopes at the top of Mauna Kea. They didn't seem to be trying to interfere with the telescopes, but what exactly they were doing remains a mystery. There is an unusual level of activity occurring on the part of the Chinese, and one has to wonder what they are up to. Aside from the spy balloon and the spy satellite, it could all be coincidence, but it's starting to look like they're probing our defenses for some reason. I hope they or the Russians aren't preparing to launch a first strike at us. That would make a really bad day for everyone and everything on earth. It is also pretty scary when both the Russian and Chinese leadership have said that a retaliatory nuclear strike is survivable. Some in the Russian Government have said that Russia should make a "pre-emptive" first strike against the United States and Great Britain. It's not helping matters that far right wing Republicans are constantly second guessing the President, and talking about reducing defense spending. TBH, I wasn't this scared about the possibility of a nuclear war during the entire Cold War. At that time, all parties realized that a nuclear first strike would also be a last strike, and an end of them personally. When people start to think that they can survive it, well, that's when miscalculations. We have to make it clear to both these nations (and to North Korea also) that if they launch, our missiles will be on the way before their missiles get here, and that our response will be massive enough that there will be no surviving it. You might survive the blasts, but you're going to die a slow painful death from the radiation. At present the Russians look at nukes as being nothing more than a bigger bang. They need to be reminded that the fallout will last for decades, if not centuries. Crops will fail and livestock will die, as will all wild flora and fauna. It won't help to tell them that they are subjecting the people to something horrible. They don't care. They only care about their own wellbeing. They need to know that there will be nothing left for them other than a slow, painful death. If they understand that, maybe they will come back to their senses.
Shoot first ask questions later -
We will NEVER get the TRUTH from this administration
When you really need to distract the public from what's really going on, you make a mysterious event to divert eyes elsewhere.
This is misleading. Humans do not fear.
The aliens are going to be pissed.
We will never learn what was shot down. It's a UFO, which means they will label it as a weather balloon as they did in the Rosewell incident
No such thing as aliens. All of the elites/governments are in cahoots with each other. Trying to play the average person.
The cia will soon have this taken down lol
Oh you mean it was hard to observe while traveling at 600 - 1200 mph?  Groundbreaking.
Why couldn't the US have sent up "Harrier" jets, ( which can hover in place), to intercept these balloons? This way, they could get close & photograph  these objects, in detail, instead of passing by at 500 or 600 mph!
So, are we to believe the fighters flew up and shot it down without flying around it and videoing the crap out of it before they shot? And, no one followed it down to see where it landed?
The stadium where the Super Bowl is at kind of looks like a spaceship.😜
MARS ATTACKS!
Well it apparently didn't effect targeting sensors. Lol
The greatest danger to America.. is this type of technology. First it is not from the universe. We do not have that technology they would have never knocked it down.. it is either from the inner earth. Our new technology out of India or the New world order.. what is wrong with. Think🤔Orson Welles
ufo lol jk
How many decades without either this happening or the gov telling us about it, now three in a week! Something stinks!
Stop lying about these things they've been flying in our airspace for a while remember a cylindrical shape it said the same thing that USS Nimitz report it and now they're saying they can identify please stop lying already everybody know the world's going to be Doom sooner or later let us f****** know the truth
This shit wouldn't be happening if Trump were in office.
It was pyramid shaped
Be careful! Don’t shoot E.T.!
I don’t believe a word CNN says, they’ve lost all credibility.
Clowns 🤡 in control, where is the video 📹?
It was an Eagle 5... only the real ones with know this... but I'll give you a hint.  "I bet she gives great helmet "... 😉
How does this clown still have a job? 😂😂😂
Was probably Optimus Prime coming to warn/Prepare us for Megatron and we just blew his ass up…
It’s Chinese.
This is a manipulation. CNN doesn't cover anything that doesn't fit an agenda (see Nord Stream 2 Sy Hersh story).
Well, I won’t believe anything  mumbles JB has to say. “ mfgifdddfhmwchjp”
You can't believe everything that CNN tells you.  They are known for "stretching" the truth to fit their agenda.
Could the ' Chinese ballon be american in fact.....to cover up the next incident. Because all the time the attention goes to the chinablimb, instead of the real deal from saturday. Smart move if you want to confuse people
So this talking head on CNN has got all of this information from military fighter pilots speaking "out of school."  Yea - gotta call BS on this one.  Being spoon fed a whole bowl of it.
Is it a fucking ufo from another world ! Wtf !
CNN is a failure You helped the swamp win and now you help them distract stupid people from things like the Epstein list, laptop, bidens multiple failures and the facts that many idiots think they helped our country when in fact they are helping destroy it by trusting you
Don't believe it was shot down
Pilots are not allowed to say things about there interactions
False Flag.. Fake News… Who knows if the balloon was even from China? And this one???
Sounds like a lot of bullshit to me.   No one from the military or government speaks about classified information when they encounter things they wouldn’t want civilians to know about.   Whatever it is, it’s probably man-made and that’s why we’re getting this ‘ooooOooo it’s mysterious’ tone.
Where are the photos!?!
I'm imagining some giant yellow Pikachu balloon that broke free from some parade and has been floating around in the air ever since.😆
Did I miss something? Was the recording actually played?
Here we go, the alien threat we've been hearing would be introduced on lame stream. At least they got the comedy news right by having that clown acosta present it.
They shot down a ufo lol
What do you think?? Is this another Roswell??
No doubt this was a demonic entity
Soooooo….they dont man these fighter jets with video cameras??? 🤔
Gearing up for the fake alien invasion. Get ready folks. 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐍
" I don't  want to get to technical "  the audience is to dumb to know anything I  say, so I'll  use little words and fill it up with bullshit as I  go along.
It was geo-spatial helium ballon from Zimbabwe to guide antelopes and impalas to find fertile grazing pastures all over the globe .
Ya'll know there's a town in OH right now with a chemical burn going on creating a toxic cloud that can be seen from space killing birds and livestock but no media is reporting on it?
The end of the US as a superpower is here
"I just wasted a 350k missle over a 50 buck ballon"????
Well there's another one over lake Michigan
American KAREN! 🇱🇷DON'T Teach me NONSENSE 🎓🕶
Fake news
FBI taking over, that's scary 😨.   We have all heard recently the condition of US FBI, CIA and DOJ.   We will never know the truth.
No one ask the question all of a sudden we have things in the sky don’t know what it is and we are shooting them down ever since that ballon that flew over all of the US
Oh boy, just declared war on the Aliens.  Welcome to earth.
There's so much bunk being spouted right now. Are these balloons being used to drop the next variant of Covid?
Maybe aliens are sick and tired of humans destroying the world through war and pollution and feel it’s time to make themselves known to bring the world together to worry more about our planet than selfish killings over land and politics! Or it’s just China, Russia, North Korea and Iran testing our military response for what is to come. Because we all know humans are the true scum of the Earth!
Earth vs Flying Saucers Great movie!
Another check mark in the conspiracy people box. These guys have been right about everything.
When is the mothership arriving?👽👽👽👽👽👽👽🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
UFO !!
Its electronic their is no heat signature remote control
We are not alone. I believe there are other countries out there.
You didn’t answer the questions at all you just brought up china… stop talking about balloons in this segment
Get ready people they are coming
Well shit, been waiting for a ufo but not from damn fake news.
Thxu FBI, we know for sure that you'll screw it up.
We don’t know what it is?????? Ok everyone on the count of 3 Let’s all freak out Fear fear fear These people are so full of it
Lol China playing with US now ...
i wish people realized that this type of story is to distract from the derailment of the train carrying toxic chemicals in Ohio.
They shot nothing. It's all Diversion. Drawing attention away from the classified documents and Hunter Bidens crimminal activity.
It's probably a shuttle for a Chinese missile, just not armed with a live missile yet.  Just a dry run.
China is probably getting ready to hit us with an Electro Magnetic Pulse "EMP". If so, we better get ready for Armageddon.  Read the novel "One Second After". It really makes you think.
Satellites can see my car in my driveway...but they dont know what the object looked like? Something screwy going on.
she is pretty is all i see
Smoke and Mirrors people !
Let mil inteligence do all that, do not trust FBI
Alien reconnaissance ship… oh boy, Alien is not going to like this… prepare for Alien invasion
There’s nothing new here
Defense probing my kiddies
Could this be a prelude to an attack?
Advanced Technology........wooooola
Embarrassing! F-22s only air-to-air kill in history, was a balloon 🎈 F-15 Eagle 104 kills 0 losses in air-to-air combat!
Tired of hearing this balloons from China 💩. Sure the first one was, but these other two aren’t. Notice that there isn’t any photos or videos of them. 🤔
David Attenborough voice.   And here we have discovered a new species of animal as we ......boom!!   And on to the bohemian tree frog.
We already know where it came from
Of course, it has to be ALIENS!
🤥
So they shoot it down and it crashes onto the ice. Hope there is something left of it that says "Made in China"
How to know when something is a fake story If cnn reports on it in depth.
Does anyone know if they could just be some type of super drones? Could this literally be a prank??
I bet it was triangle 🔺️ with rounded ends and a light on each end js .
@2:16 ooooppssss
Gulf of Tonkin 2.0
Yea cus we can totally trust the fbi with this investigation. Lol tomorrow we are gonna hear that it’s trumps spy balloon carrying nukes.
Let's just comprehend that there was no trouble identifying the first one. Now several world's have been definitely used that explains they didn't know what the second one was.
☢A Diversion.....     hiding USA terriost act on Germany and Russia by blowing Nordstream pipeline!     Using Navy team from Florida!
Jim Acosta is still doing news?
I just can't help myself from laughing  at this Ahole Jim Acosta !!! What a cartoon character !
Calling Area 51
well whatever it was, it was a weather balloon.
LOOK UP OIL IN OHIO
I wish our Air Force would start sending two airplanes up to go against these balloons but the one to take the first shot should have the laser they make lasers for those airplanes. What a better way to try it out all right this is Jim mungai from Kennerdell Pennsylvania.
Could have been one of those tic tac UFO’s described by Navy pilots last year on 60 minutes 🤔
Lol jus tell us the truth!!!!!
This, wars, earthquakes and part of the sun has come off and is flying around.  Plus wouldn't this be a job for military intelligence, DIA etc not the FBI. It's a UFO not Tony Soprano.
Maybe they will abduct Joe Biden sniff him and give him a probing.  We can hope
A nuclear event coming to a American city near you. How's that diversity working out for you America given queers and trans people rights.
Hey look over DISTRACTION here, there is DISTRACTION something over here. It is DISTRACTION weird and DISTRACTION unusual.
They are slowly getting the people use to the facts aliens exist and they are showing themselves to us more and more
Everyone knew you knew the truth, but you are pretending you don't know, and assuming it's from China and for military purposes and dangerous. That's all it means.
FBI MEANS WE GET ZERO HONEST INFORMATION AND OR ANSWERS.
1:20 So the reason why more information is not being reported is because we don't know enough about the  "unidentified" object  picked up on radar, observed by multiple pilots in flight, surveilled by on board sensors, engaged by on board weapons systems and shot down.  But once the debris  from the previously unidentified object hit by sidewinder missiles "10 miles off the frozen coast of Alaska " is located, collected and analyzed, then we can identify it better and tell you what it is.  OMG. What A mindfk in the making. In the mean time let your imaginations run wild. Cause have we got a show for you.
This is all apart of the agenda, the will push this alien invasion and false flags to promote “one world government” it’s happening right in front of your face
A side issue of some matter not seen.  What is the average age of reporters and anchors that are male? In comparison to the female gender.
They know what it is for sure. They can test the material pretty quickly and determine if it’s elements we have on the earth or not …. It’s scary and interesting at the same time ….
China
CNN= certified NonFactual Nonsense
$200 million dollar balloon poppers .    LoL 😂
Sounds like Aliens to me
It was George Jetson and Jane his wife . Coming for a visit
The big question is what did they see in our skies and how come the pilots don't know what they say something fishy is going on.....How comes the truth is noting being told to the American people and the big question is what in the world is really going on?????
Who let this dufus on the air?!!
I think China didn't want any American visitor because they are literally on verge of invading Taiwan  & couldn't let US see the preparations.
At this point in time , I wouldn't let the FBI check an apple for worm's , as they would say it had camel's , as they were instructed to buy the globalist elite !!! 🤔🧐🥴
American fighter jets shoot-down balloons the United States military shut down UFO alien balloons Chinese insurrectionist balloons North Korean insurrectionist balloons UFO Invaders insurrectionist balloons UFO invasion from a galaxy far far away come in balloons invading America UFO Invaders insurrectionist balloons
Natasha is sexy
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Keep in mind this CNN clown news network!🎉
We never will as we live in a communist country as well as communist CNN.
Who can believe anything CNN says ?
Recon scout drone ufo sent 👀🛸
no call sign
99 Luftballons.
They will NEVER admit it if it were an alien spacecraft. The government continues to insult our intelligence
They are sending virus in them .
Now China is seeing some type of unidentified objects, shits getting crazy...
Ballon could a hoax covering up the real deal from saturday.....I think so.....
so they shot down a tic tac? this certainly doesnt sound like any balloon, its sounding exactly how the TIC TAC hypersonic UFO was described, but that object had the ability to actively jam and ofc it was hypersonic so its highly unlikely that our caveman tech could shoot it down
Well you already know you're not going to get the truth out of the FBI.
Hunters laptop is gone now
WhatEVER 🙄
another day another psyop
The planes have cameras. Maybe they should look at the footage.
Something escaped from Area 51 and that's where they got it at.
Well the fbi did have x files they were stolen and coincidentally a show started called the x files bob was in Syriana a movie
I call 🧢
This is ridiculous. China on the sudden verge of a coup? Gtfo. Also, China does not war with us, not now anyways. China and the US are completely dependent on each other and it would take decades of serious dedicated policies to change that.
If it's a UFO I'm going to be so hyped up
👽
I miss hearing from Natasha Bertrand, good to hear the concise and deliberate style she has mastered again.
A Kree scout ship, from the Marvel universe!
Debris is not an intact object so which is it.
Nothing but speculation here
It's a smoke screen.
Hope we didn’t piss off any aliens
Ok so they have been running into silver spherical objects of different sorts with unhuman capabilities for years now.  Objects that have interfered in military training exercises involving f-18s and they decide to shoot one down now?    This just might be the start of it finally.....how they will slowly catch us up to the tech that they have and have had for years. I wonder when we will find out that we've been lied to since the beginning of our "civilization".
Next up; recovered object determined to be chinese.
We know what it was……Stop LYING……….
Lies..lies..nothing..to distract people from country inside problems!
One thing is absolutely obvious:  We the people will not be told the entire truth, if any truth at all.
HOLD ON ☝️🧐,,, these jet's had on board camera's. EVERYTHING was recorded, the fact this is not mentioned at all leads to only one conclusion. EVERYTHING you hear or read is 100% pure BullSh#t and put out to confuse everyone. What we do know,, it's a man made object, most likely a balloon of some type (1970's technology) and could even have been someones science project. One other thing,,, What ever China is doing,,, we are doing 100 times more to them. Never forget that part.
Analyzed by the FBI??? Well, the world will never know anything. What has the FBI ever got right these past few years? They only show how dysfunctional they are everytime. A sad lot of no gooders. Let the military or  area 51 analyze the debris if it exists.. Involving the FBI,  as in charge, tells me this is a con of some kind. Usually the government would go out of it's way to coverup  a UFO sighting,  let alone a crash site.  And it just happened in a remote area with no civilian witness.  Is this info a test for the public's  reaction to ufo's?
Stop killing our aliens
Well if they shot it down then it is not an 🛸, it most likely was a Chinese spy balloon.
Alien technology that can bend time and gravity, yet brought down with our weapons? Not likely. Man made by? c i a operation
This is easy. It was Alf going back to Melmac.
So, you can believe the government or cnn.  🤔
Does anyone else want it to be aliens so the religious people will stfu?
The same kind of U.A.P.'s(UFO's)are starting to show up in Canada & China as well.I think they (aliens)sense we're on the verge of nuclear destruction or more likely the governments of the earth are looking for a scapegoat to avoid WW3 & unite the planet into a one world government.Notice how these U.A.P's show up in the Artic circle.Nazis from Antartica?Admiral Byrd said those guys were for real.Gonna be a fun summer I can tell!https://www.youtube.com/live/Af9C27b43AI?feature=share
I'm pretty sure it's Russians
I love how when captions are on they use "she" for describing Xi. Fitting.
Blah blah blah!!! Where's the pictures and the video of the supposed "object" ?? Let's start there!!!
Its aliens there watching us all destroy eachouther and then they will strike
Aliens mjaaaaaaaaan!!!
UFO's  😂 🤣😂 🤣
Looks like they need something to cover up what they found from the Chinese balloon lol
How to spread a false news on someone?
Fighter shot down “MAGA object”.. FULL of “Bullshit, gas (lightning) and Hot air”!! 😂
The Anunnakis are coming back
Ohh good the fbi taking the lead.... Great
Roswell mk2
..still waiting for Amazon to deliver my industrial h2o heater, wtf is taking so long??
The Chinese military  has learned how to manufacture  UFOs🛸...🤣
CNN….that’s all needed to see…
Mars Attacks !!! Ack Ack  Hunter Biden China Ack Ack Hunter Biden China Ack Ack
"Anyone is isn't confused really doesn't understand the situation!" -- Edward R. Murrow
Look it's not a alien space ship or object. There is no way any human technology can take down a craft of a interstellar alien being.   Don't be fooled.  I am calling B U L L S H I T.
So we shot down aliens thinking it was China. Cool.
Fake news. Propaganda
Could be china North Korea Russia Iran possibly keep sending drones with dangerous contagious virus that can be spread airborne Covid part 2 👀  Or surveillance drones spying on USA military assets OR 😂 uFos 🛸
Why is it ok to say Chinese spy balloon but racist to say Chinese virus?
Oh my god it’s aliens
You can show us the balloon but not a UFO load a shit I don't believe this administration as far as I can throw them
?UFO!
Is Taiwan doing it to keep the US pissed at China?
Another Chinese spy balloon. Take notes 🤔 she was kind enough to let America know the truth... 🙏🙌😇✨🌎✌️❤️
2:51 I thought they said it was an USAF F-22 while the RCAF jets were F-18.
Tic tac toe
Project Blue Beam in full effect. Get ready for what’s coming.
ALIENS!! Has to be!!!
Some of those “conspiracy theory kooks” on Metabunk might actually have this figured out. If it turns out they are right you won’t hear it on CNN.
"Probe droid. I didn't hit it very hard. Must have had a self-destruct. It's a good bet the [China] knows we're here...."
It's google maps
It has been claimed ET can manipulate conscious thought and experience. Perhaps why the pilots had different experiences encountering this craft.
It was a birthday balloon ...
Is that a ted cruise / Ben Shapiro deep fake. What is even real?
Hardly a fraction of the information the US has on the non balloon objects has been released. Not even a photo...  Makes me wonder why they ever admitted to having seen them in  the first place and to shooting them down. This behavior is as strange as the objects... What is going on here ?
ALIENS!!
👽: "This is madness!'  Pilot: "This                   Is                    *EARTH!!!* " 😡 💢
It's 👽 we in trouble now
It’s a UFO 🛸
HEY Robert ITs not china or any other that has this tech ...and you know it !!
All fake news this is to distract ur from whts really happening the Hunter Biden investigations Thts goin on and the more release of Epstein documents
I don't believe anything that comes outta CNN ! And why is it that these particular incidents are being let out to the public , in the past it would take months to get any info on something like this ! I don't care what Biden does , he is still a piece of shit for a president ! That goes for his administration and puppeteers !
Where's Scully and Mulder? 👽👽👽
Probably was finally a UFO. Fukn Aliens man.
Hey aliens. Please “Visit” Washington DC first. There’s a lot of “things” to study there.
The pilots saw an unidentified object! What they could just barely see was that the creatures inside the flying object looked green and slightly fluorescent!  How ridiculous, laughable, and not to be taken seriously is CNN! 🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸
So we know it's not man made or its identifiable
Putin sent that (MFO) mysterious flying object.
Sure I'll watch just give me one second to skip that ad with the lady putting the fake teeth in her mouth for the 10 millionth time that I'm not going to buy.
It came from beyond the ice wall....
That was a nonsensical discussion by a reporter who has no clue about what he’s discussing, and some dude spewing random buzzwords.  Whether pilots descriptions conflict with each other at this point is moot, we won’t ultimately be given any details.
I'm not buying it.
How can I believe this this is cnn
It may have landed on the ground but in one of the most remote, harsh environments on the planet. I’d say the water in myrtle beach would be easier for a recovery mission.
Lol.. more cowbell !! and the dumbing down continues…
So UFO under threat now?))) Curious to see footage. Hope US government services wouldn't hold public in darkness.🧐
ALWAYS remember, " IF IT BLEEDS, WE CAN KILL IT"
America is on a Balloon 🎈 Genocide  😂😂
We don’t know what it is. We will protect you BUT we need to take more freedoms away…. Don’t trust the government or media ie just another branch of the government!!!
It's sick putin playing Narcissist mind games. This is what Covert narcissists are good at: Causing tension between China and US.
FBI in charge? 🤡
They lie lie lie about EVERYTHING 😶
It's always a good idea to shoot at things when you have no idea what they are,  I mean what could go wrong ?
Sounds like  they just saying everything joe Rogan has said on his podcast
It’s Wonder Woman in her invisible aircraft, & now Canada & US have killed her…..😢
And this is why I only watch FOX.
Can you image what crazy talk in QAnon right now?
Drone
My bullsh*t detector is going off⚠️🚨
Weak leadership has consequences.
It's all bullshit.
Rick: Morty you little idiot. You just made the government shoot down Santa Clause. Santa just got shot down. We single handedly reignited the war on Christmas Morty. We're  effed Morty. We gotta save Christmas Morty. Get that bag and follow me.
Mysterious object or unidentified flying object…all this talk is fueling my aliens being found hopes.
I'm sure both pilots took video of it before the brought it down. They know more than they're telling
Whoever sent them, probably wants the governments to blow them up to release the chemicals that will harm/ kill us
Could it be as simple as the Chinese  /Russians initiated a practice run. To see where all the military might is coming from.  Then plotting to destroy those bases.  Kind of like a fishing trip. A little bait to find the biggest fish.
El primer globo fue de las esferas del dragón de Dragon Ball este otro aparato espacial parece ser del espacio exterior de algún planeta desconocido que quiren saber cómo es la atmósfera de nuestro planeta y,  en especial, quiren saber cómo es el clima de EEUU 😂🤣
Poop
They do not know anything. Bob Baer doesn't know anything either; he is just speculating since has to say something, which he did. Different pilots saw different things/objects, which adds to the puzzle. That doesn't mean the pilots are fabricating what they saw. So, it's beyond our capabilities. I think the Chinese are more advanced than they are given credit for, especially in quantum technology.
CNN = Shit
How can they say this stuff? The optics just make us look inept.
How does CNN even operate? It's garbage!
No propulsion system?
The government knows exactly what it is. Anyone saying that they don’t i know someone in the desert that has  ocean front land for sale
if it is aliens which i doubnt as much as idd like, wouldnt it be a bad start to diplomatic relations if we have blown up their ship?
Media wants to have a mystery story, so they fabricate one. The Military pilots know exactly what they saw!!!
Mind your business and stop pretending you care
China is sending Joe Biden his 10 %!
Sounds like an EMP. They are gana take out our military communications before invasion. China and Russia together.
When you know that much… don’t talk or don’t call yourself a journalist!
Let's see the video from the jets
This is obviously trumps fault
We done f up now the aliens going want they stuff back 😩
did they shoot down a UFO?!  was it filled with air?! if it was solid, it had to be a craft!!
Pfizer control cult, the devil 🌈🌈🌈🌈worship and the evil work afoot, the clickety clack, the racket, the little hooves upon the roof, 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄devil’s nervous conditioning of the Pfizer ding “medication time” 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫.
Propaganda
Seeing that Jim Acosta is involved in this interview, I find it difficult to take anything he says seriously.
CNN is gonna wear this story out.  It’s almost as good as searching for the missing Malaysian plane …..
Where is photo of that object? sounds like just propagandas
It's stupid to think they're using any of this for surveillance. They have satellites that we as civilians can zoom into people's yards. They don't need a cheap ass balloon or airplane to see you.
Definitely a UFO
There’s no way a pilot has spoken to anyone outside of debrief about to what they saw. It’s fvcking CNN for chrissake.
Comet ☄️ pass few days ago first time in 50 billion years #weoweunothinggoaway 👽
Am I the only one that this reminding u of movie the Thing
OK Chyyyna, pay no mind to those things overhead that look like B-52s. They're just you know.    B-52s.
People... don't buy this shit
"WELCOME TO EARTH" !!!!💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿
With CNN reporting and Sleepy Joe and the little Dick-tator running things, China is laughing at us….
They are lying. Because the pilots would never speak about this. The military are very secretive and its always dealt within.
The Government will cover up another UFO like Roswell. If it was Chinese built spy vehicle, I doubt Norad, or anyone else has a clue what they are capable of.  Why is it only now that they are doing something about Chinese balloons because it's a political hot button.
Arcturians and Peiladians are here. Don’t shoot them? They are here to help us find peace. Send Jim Kirk to talk with them. Find out what they want.
Here begins the next big hoax Probably say it’s a craft ‘not of this world’ and if Bob Lazar is truthful, it could be ours that has been reverse engineered. Anything to scare the masses and keep us all relying on our governments to keep us safe. They have kept everything that’s been witnessed in our skies to themselves for years, all of a sudden, the Nimitz footage is leaked and now this mysterious object is shot out of the sky I wouldn’t put anything passed our leaders
Sounds like a false flag set up by the government
This really sounds like a movie!
They know exactly what it is and where it came from the current administration just doesn't want to tell us because it will make them look bad.
Not sure what it is, It is kind of round, has hot gases in it with Chinese writing. It could be anything though kitchen sink or ford pinto no one knows for sure.
I think we need to except the fact that this very likely could be Aliens!
mylar  with hieroglyphic writing on it
No cockpit video? Cover up!
More media bs.
Great we started a war with aliens ....
We got a ufo guys
How do we know this piece isn’t democrat propaganda, CNN has lost all credibility
We have no idea where it came from, what it is, where it is going. So we conclude it is a chinese spy balloon.
Doesn't cnn have a trash can to burn.
Tell ET to go home no visitors to day
Everything out of that mans mouth is a fabricated lie. Why are they allowed to even be called news? They act as if they actually had a chance to interview the pilots.... which they didnt because I know for fact. CNN.... the leader of fake news and lies
Finally something better than the lies those PR people were saying...always trying to shut the voices of the people...the lady reporter is a breath of fresh air and for once CNN good job done 💯
I wish we could see but I understand why it can’t be publish
TELL THE TRUTH  WE CAN HANDLE IT
Why isn't there a video of the surveillance when they detected this flying object
You mean to say that recovery of the balloons are hard to recover because of bad/cold weather. Says enough what kind of military we have
Reporting to you live from the CNN news room this just in bla bla bla bla bla bla bla blabla blabla
3 total in less than a week.They didn't even bother to show pictures of the object both the one in Alaska and the one in Canada just shot last 2 looks like a false-flag psyops . Watch 1958 footage from the Navy where they use them balloons and put them in the air with explosions that set off a nuclear explosion out of them in order to create an EMP when they were testing on small versions but it's the same exact looking balloon as Chinese. Look at the destruction done to our country the last 2 years now people got to pay attention to stand up and pick up that second amendment cuz this is handing over the US to unified world Biden Kamala pelosi zielinski when he was here they all use that terminology so does that WEP definitely the UK and certain people in Europe governments across the world. This is the stage at which the deep state going to try to create a war.
aliens
Ancient Aliens
UFO
CNN 😂
This could be it. If there is a small circle of people who usually contains info on e.t. life, can they gey away with it under these circumstances?
Not scientists or even a college graduate but my blue collar ass knows it not from this world! Shit doesn’t just float at 30,000 feet!
It has begun!
If there’s anyone we can trust, it’s CNN😂😂 🤦🏽
I can't be the only one who went "Oh hey. She's smoking hot!"
If it's aliens then I'm like Captain Kirk, I want to try out some of that green strange.
So we're shooting down UFO's now. We should be capturing these things. Can't we put someone (Capt. Wille E.) on an ACME balloon and capture that thing? Maybe the Mythbusters guys could capture this?
China is after Alaskan oil
Why they lying about things that don't need to be lied about
Criminal behavior, you get away with committing a crime, the criminal will try to see how much they can get away with, since Biden let them get away with the first one, now Canada is being tested to see if they're as stupid as Biden.
Aliens are here and what a way to come through the front door!😎😎😎😎😎
Now you know why alien's passing by earth slouch in thier seats and lock their doors.
Don't we have satellites with cameras in space that has video of this UFO or UAP 👽👽
when the pilot shootdown this object did this object blow up like a balloon?
Why no photos or video??
I want CHINA 🇨🇳 know God,,, But CHINA can't detach it's love for an IDOL WORSHIPPERS ( INDIA 🇮🇳),, So China concentrates in blacks countries or Muslims or catholics ,, But if God has chosen them ,, china will not succed,, We can give our maximum fight or our maximum resistance to China ,, But we are nobody,, We believe God Almighty God,, All men die ,, So God is our helper or judge,, We believe a true God who gives us Peace and hope ,, Strength to do good works ,, Help a needy,, But oppressed ,, Not a HAUGHTY or high minded or false humility PEOPLE who live in Pakistan or India or North Korea,, We will help china a lot of they  a Gospel book ( Mathew or JOHN) a syllabus in their school  Yes God bless China 🇨🇳 We don't fear lot for any man , But we are careful ,,we have to be very careful ,, China must know it's real strength in 1920 ,,even japan was attacking them 😁😁😁😁and taking their lands ,, Amen  Thank you Jesus ❤️❤️👍👍
Congrats you just started an intergalactic war..........
If the FBI is on it it’s prob not aliens
Operation blue benis
I flew the plane and there weren't nothin there. Naw, ain't nothing there.
"Klaatu barada nikto!"
Probably had info from Hunter's laptop.
All  this is  is a big distraction  from What is  really going on.         Look here not there !!!!!
This is all meant to be a distraction.
Hope it’s aliens. But the government would never confirm.
Someone get Scully and Mulder on the phone to make sense of this. Where is Scully? Where is Fox? 😩
They spy-we spy. Its probably been several spy ballons a month flying over our airspace for the last couple years. They keep it a secret. They only informed us and shot it down as a diversion from political damaging news of classified docs and the big guys family problems are getting worse.
😂😂Thank heavens Bumbling Joe is in charge when we are being attacked by balloons. He is the right man to handle such a situation 🤣🤣
Is this more fake news
Was it another Jean Jacket from NOPE?!
Did it look like a "Tic Tak"?
It must be Alien 👽
That’s the Decepticons Megatron is coming 🤷‍♂️
It’s undermining Xi and his power in China, as a internal struggle is happening now?
So dramatic
The question is would they tell you if we was under attack or act like it another
Those poor innocent Aliens.
Let’s hope the FBI doesn’t lose all the evidence this time
ET origin has been completely discounted.
I don't believe it. The pilots wouldn't be in position to speak about the mission. Especially directly after it.
Get Mulder and Sculley on it.
what a mousekateer.....everyone this is fake newd..like the covid masks..let it go
They get paid not to tell you the truth. Just like your politicians
Another tic tac incident lol
If its China, it is extremely unlikely the military is acting independently of their government. Totalitarian states simply don't work that way to pull off high profile actions like this in succession.
I feel it in my bones, WAR is coming! No respect for one another, teasing using spy balloons and any other aircraft. They think its funny and do more and this is all a bad sign of whats coming. We cannot allow incursions into our country. Its not safe for the people. Eventually USA and Canada will say no more and lay down a red line in the sand. You can feel the disrespect so intensely, its coming.
They got one… what’s in it? What’s it made of? How did it fly?
Anyone else thinkin Aliens 👽??? Just me…?
What would scare me more than if it was confirmed that these are UFO's; is the thought that Poopy Pants and Heels Up would represent the USA & the world. Be safe and be 😎
Canadian asst. PM said it was reported to be "cylindrical". This is the same term as used by the Navy pilots for the "tic-tac" uap seen in 2014, I believe.
They know what it is. It’s a cover up to protect Biden’s catastrophic leader ship
It's alien
Call Linda Moulton Howe 👽👽
OMG this slowly turned into a CHINESE conversation lol
African balloons making americans paranoid.
HAVE WE MADE CONTACT? IF WE DID AND WE JUST SHOT THEM DOWN THEN THERE GOES THE IDEA THAT THEY WILL COME IN PEACE NEXT TIME.
Do you think they will tell you an me the truth i don't think so
Stop with the is it China bs anything that's flying with no wings is alien or USA we spend almost 900billion on military China and Russia spend less then 10billion.. and if so it's China well we want all the money back from the military for being useless spending
Hopefully it is aliens and our new overlords hate democRATs and communists 👽🛸
Biden is coming for any of you making under $40,000 per month ($400k per yr.
Do they have a balloon that is capable of mach 6. Really that is very advanced technology.
They have downed a tictac officially!!!! Now, do they expose the alien tech or cover it up again?!
Why are we letting the FBI take lead on this investigation when they couldn’t even keep up with Hunter Biden’s laptop?
It was ET, ET don't  shoot 😁😁😁😁😁
Shapeshifter
I find it hard to believe a plane was in the area while shooting it down, and wasn’t able to stick around to see where it’s debris landed ..
This is obviously the start of an alien invasion.
The jets that shot down the balloon were F22's not F35s. That closed my ears right off the bat as it signals to me your expert is no expert... Just sayin'
I like how they casually keep adding CHINA AND RUSSIAN plants in your thinking BASED OFF ZERO FACTS THAT SAY THAT. Lol  Good JoB MEDIA
They need to stop shooting it down and start catching it's a whole lot easier
Jug head!
Dang it we shot down Santa's slay
How low & How quickly can you fly your "Blackhawk"  Go and Get them OUT....... last
That pilot got himself a lifelong job at Ancient Aliens series
Fake news
Sounds like a Tic tac
UFO I hope they end up showing us 😭
America must move away from the narrative of provocation. America has always fought it's military battles away from home and has been successful. It's concentration over the years has been away from home in areas like Syria, Iran, Ukraine and Taiwan. Focus has been China and Russia as threats to it's economic and military superiority.  China and Russia know it's difficult to fight the US away from home, difficult to win as well, so the spy balloon and the other objects are a warning that a war with China or maybe any of what it terms it's enemies will *be* or partly will have to fought on home soil. The war has come to America. Homeland security must be as vigilant as there seems to be a drop in focus a decade after 9/11, something that America's enemies I believe have noticed.   Imagine the nuclear sites the spy balloon flew over are China's target if the war broke out? Anything is possible and in this case preparation becomes key not only with allies as seen in recent military drills but also internally paying attention to the war coming home.
These clips make me wonder if you spent any time before you started talking thinking about the words you use or the speculation you added? It's not unrealistic to expect two pilots are different trajectories to have different experiences. Why not avoid the speculation until you have actual data to back it up?
The Truth is out there...
What better time for aliens to attack Earth than now, not that we have a snowball's chance in hell of defending ourselves. The ridiculous thing is that we have people in this country clambering for a Civil War. That sounds like something out of the Vladimir Putin playback.
March 6? That's not from around here!
Chalians  Chinese aliens
knucklehead said the speed of the F-35 was too fast to get a good look at it, when it can actually come to a complete stop in mid air if it wants to
Same Ole conversation
This “object” was abandoned!
Why didn't China send the recon ballon to Rosewell New Mexico and confirm the US shot down aliens in the 1950's. We want the truth.
This is a set up from the governments....people watchout...i repeat : this is a set up in order to scare humanity ( as another pandemic like ) and increase military budget
Great, war with Russia, China, Iran, and ANDROMEDA all at once.
I think we just shot down a Grey's ship. No knowen propulsion about the size of a car.? No probing for you mf.
I'm not saying that it's aliens but... it's aliens.   :)
It's not China on this one stop fear mongering
It is impossible to infiltrate?. I don't buy it. Just do it.
Decoys.
No super secret mystery probes to collect intelligence, they just have agents here living and working in corporate and government employment that get all the info/access they could ever desire.
So we all are going to just act like we haven’t been talking about UAPs for awhile now.  The timing though….🧐🧐🧐🧐 …
I hope is alien so I can beg them to beam up to it. This world is driving me crazy.👽👣
They have pictures of this. Lets see them
The speed of the F35 cause it to look like a white picked fence going click click click. Before they blasted it.
Rather than shooting them with a missile would not it have been better to use a few bullets and let it deflate slowly to the ground. That way the payload might not be so damaged on landing
They want Taiwan and they are upping the pressure
I sure we aren't pissing off some aliens!!
I could assume all this pilot does. They don’t know squat!😅
Sounds like a UFO any aliens on board
By the time the president of the alien nation finds out that the US shot down the airship transporting his grandson and his girlfriend back to the alien kingdom, I will already be back to my African continent. Bye bye to Dallas.
That's a great way to say hello to ET
I thought we had a technology where we could detect what’s coming in through air, land or whatever else what’s really going on ?
Demented biden can’t control the border or US airspace.  Russia and China laughs at him.
With a clearance you can’t speak out
Anything to distract you from the homemade Childporn and bribes from China on Hunter Bidens laptop
Wouldn't it be funny if it the last one over Canada..(.most recent,not Alaska) reportedly resembling a 'disc' of some kind...was actually from a more intelligent race of beings who already know we will shoot WHOEVER it is, before really knowing.  🤣🤠 Quick Draw McGraw
👽🛸👽🛸👽
No mystery no aliens at this Point. A spy apparatus using a different theoretical approach such as a Tesla theory for its operations. Not to mention the military would not let this kind of information out so whatever's going on, Can't hide the fact that a spy apparatus is a spy apparatus.
Trying to make sense of all these events combined. The government had already admitted UFO's are real. Maybe these foreign balloons are up there trying to study them, and were shooting down both the balloons and UFO's now.
Yal people think Aliens, who would have to be 1000x more sophisticated than us, would send....balloons?
Maybe it came out of one of the mysterious holes in the artic 😆. It will be years before we know the truth.
The Aliens must be saying to themselves, “why do these stupid humans keep shooting down our intergalactic drones, don’t they know that we equipped the drone with a very special payload… their own key to enter the multi dimensional universe!!! 🤯😖🙄😦😤😱🥵”
Let’s hear what the pilot recording said first why is this such a big deal now about balloons why provoke China now this has been happening for years?
Disclosure is coming.
Aliens!!!
Even CNN admits it was a Chinese spy balloon!
Not the FBI. How about a nongovernmental entity instead?
I wish this much coverage UAPs received
Classic distraction from morons.  Yeah yeah, it was this thing that did a thing or could have done the thing from the mouth of an unnamed source that doesn't really exist!  This is CNN, your news source!
Because taking high resolution images from a billion dollar airplane was asking too much! Where are the videos and pictures? Smh!
Smoke and Mirrors 🪞 What's the True Story is... WE AS A SUPER POWER HAS EXPIRED .
great...now we're going to have to send bugs bunny to space to steal the Q36 space modulator from Marvin the Martian so our world doesn't get blown up...that would be Trump's plan...
It's cylindrical with no visual propulsion system. Drones use propulsion with electric propellers. Drones aren't cylindrical, and last, what drone is able to hit Mach 6?  It's not a drone. Stop saying it's a drone. Whatever they shot down, it's a type of scout UFO since it's fast, with no defense or offense capabilities. That doesn't mean it's alien necessarily, but that doesn't rule out the chances of it being alien either.
Let's see the video.
Damn so the pilots didn't know how it was floating, meaning it wasn't a baloon, wasn't a plane or helicopter.
A UFO and they are studying our behavior
wonder who the epstein client list will name
ET will not be phoning home😂
What do Chinese, Russians, and Aliens all have in common?  They didn't fly anything over American airspace when Trump was president.
Something fishy is going on.
Let's just hope a mothership doesn't suddenly appear in the sky...since we're going all willy nilly shooting everything down in the sky before we know what exactly it is.
LEAVE THE ALIENS ALONE! We don't need a war with an advanced civilization!
If it's UFO's, I wonder if they're observing the land before Yellowstone blows to smithereens, IMO.  They've been documented and discussed, for as long as Man existed and were never involved in our wars, I'd much rather it be aliens.
It’s time to bring in Bob Lazar!
CNN your Fake news headquarters 🤣
Crud. I wish to welcome you to where you are. I will relish in the exchange of gift/fruit baskets. Hooray! Please please please three times sweetly ask for yourself if you think the military welcomes you for your technology. A terrian sends welcome thithes and binds the will to trust due to interest from terrestrial galaxzy hopper. I am only one. Can I as ask for both US and Those to let them land to allow for an exchange. Dreamland? Let them welcome us as co-folk. Ready or not. If they have honor and are worthy that would be for the rest of time in The Liminal Cosmogomy. What to do what to do what to do? If they show up again they want to be here and came. I love we have invited them to go to Mexico and do. I pray to say shamogaminziaouem.    BLESSES   I am only one then now. Bow how Mama?    Dude.    When the going gets rough, we all gotta wake up to a huge battle of a HUGE WAR or we can and I have allow for a truce if left to be righteous and not to do battle. I won't shoot anything on you and I pray you won't shoot anything on me and my friends here.  Have you ever heard of The Ummits? I have been inviting them to visit and be welcome. So say hey whatcha want
The level of intelligence displayed in this comment section truly scares me
Why send a jet after a Ballon? Send something slower.
I’m ready for a YouTuber to post  a video on how they tricked the government with balloon aircraft
Quo Bono?
If trump said CHINA SPY BALLOON fake cnn would have a field day!!
Ok, CNN. Really?
I doubted ppl we would know any soon about what exactly is this "object", seems like,   this will be information classified and sealed for years to come,don't know  why authorities in charge keep saying that the public isn't ready for this kind of information.
And they´re off.....
Hmm. The CIA guy says that the F 35 is so fast that it’s pilots can’t identify other aircraft. He also says that despite the fact we know nothing and everybody is confused, chances are that this is a provocation by the Chinese.   I don’t trust CIA guy.
It is just a Chinese message that they can spy on the US while  the US sea armada continuing presence in the vicinity of China border
Only in Ohio 💀💀💀
This will sure keep all of your minds focused on spaceships and not important things
The highly advanced people who live beyond the Antarctic ice wall are starting to make contact
Did it read "happy graduation!" on the side? If so, it floated out of my yard last week.
Americas military won’t say how they know about the other 39 countries, are we doing the same as China
U know y stories don't line up?.. Because someone is lying.... Where is the hundreds of video clips that should exist?.. From surveillance planes, drones, the fighter jets? The support personnel on the ground monitoring and communicating with the flight crews? Come the fukkkk on!
😂😂😂😂
Time to put together another MJ12 so they can say whatever to cover up whatever .. 👽
being raised on planet xmosis126 seems to be really strange all them baloons in the sky  why dont they atattach rope to them so they dont float away
USA is the greatest country on earth 🌎🔥. These objects would finally be investigated and results share.
Fake fake fake distractions 😂😂
lol this guy is still employed?
China balloon to distract and pre-numb us all to the real UFO’s. Shooting down tic-tac UFO’s will be the end of humanity. A thousand of them could pop up from the oceans now that we are hostile. Could be bad news.
Its the bill gates spycraft for the left
I wish I could believe what cnn reported. I have lost all faith in them telling the truth.
CNN wants this to be a spaceship so bad
The tube with a mushroom tip was armed and ready to blow.  The F22 had to approach from the rear to get it done.  Target neutralized, job well done Captain America!
They anticipated a pascifistic response from Blinken and Biden to consumate the scheduled meeting...What they got is a cold dose of reality...this isn't the cowardly regime that they knew with commie trump!  Those follow-on balloons are likely to dilute the matter by bolstering their original claims of "gathering weather data"... Our people know better what games the CCP play...
This was fake.  They are playing off the event.  Using it to cover the original.
"There is none as blind as those who will not see"...
It will end up in Area 51.
Acosta is full of crap along with CNN
Team America and Jim Acosta is ON it. 😂
Any pictures taken?
Simpson's did it first ! Side show Bob in the Biplane defeated the US Air Force
They better not cover this up …
Of course it was sent before Blinkin went there. THE Communist China does not see anyone that is not Chinese as ‘not even being a human being.’ Do your research
Pilots never say what they saw! Anyways it was definitely a drone, they just want to make the story sound confusing and then skip saying who’s drone was that for political reasons.
America will lose this war in Ukraine, as it has lost many wars. the crazy elite of American psychopaths will not be able to do anything. Russia's nuclear triad will win anyway....
It's clear made up to make the Biden administration to look tough.
We are all done
It's another balloon. What can stay airborne for days on end without refueling? What moves slowly at high altitude? A balloon.
This person is really pushing this theory that this craft came from China, I personally do not believe that this originated in China and they will not disclose exactly what is going on.
👽: "daaaad the humans broke my new toooy!!"
Think about it..all these coming from that part of entry that who's to say that China and putin collaboration together to try destruction our military to which eyes off China that putin distracting us so China could gather info on locations of our nuclear missles silos then once gathered they both could strike from both countries to take out America.  Then once done they could be planning invasion. Also..who's to say that these balloons don't have chemicals and wanting us to deliberately shoot them down only to drop chemicals to start a pandemic of a killer virus. We need to follow back they're destination back to the source from whomever is setting these off..
I'm just so glad that this is not some sort of a psy-op created by the govts masters (military industrial complex) to divert from other matters and to instill fear within the country against China so that the public who are spoon fed the complicit medias propaganda will accept the upcoming war with China.
it is astounding how stupid y'all keep sounding everyday you find new levels of how dumb I am when I do get American News why is it so easy to see through your lies??????
No one will never it know.....Hell, I don't know if it's just more bullshit from government.
STRESS- 2023 $$$$ We're a nation of frazzled families  With little time for personal affection. As the treadmills of tension keep us hostage  We're losing our perspective of direction.  Racing to get the kids off to school,  Navigating the madness of bottleneck traffic. Fearful of our own job-loss and income,  While the newscasts get more hopeless and graphic.  Helping our children with their homework Scrambling to prepare their dinner.  Having family spats with loved ones And being told on Sunday, we're a sinner.  Worrying about crime, taxes, cancer and terrorism  Infectious disease and paying next month’s bills. Saving for college and our own retirement It's no wonder we drink, smoke, pray and pop pills.  Politicians who wish to be revered by history Must earn their fame by living the truth. Any who continue to mislead and deceive Must be shunned by the voter at the booth.  By Tom Zart Most Published Poet On The Web!
Should’ve sent up a pair of A-10 II’s service ceiling is approx. 45k ft. They can linger on site much longer at much lower speeds, leading to a much better observation. Also with spy satellites being able to read license plate numbers at ground level, what did they view? The FBI analyzing all this…??? How about the military instead…???  Sounds like more Fake News.
It is logical maneuver. Remember few years ago when a Chinese fighter jet collided with the American air craft on the border of chine.
Yea..im gonna believe this king of fake news!!!....
They're here...
Ever wonder why the cartoon news network cannot describe a balloon?  The Canadian defense already said it is a small metal balloon several hours ago.
A fat guy in a red suit was the piolet and it had a single red light in front.
Alien lives matter , stop shooting down UFOs
No footage on this one flying around 40,000 feet ?? But we have footage of the Chinese balloon at over 60,000 feet ?! 🤔
Use your brains and read. Lifting bodies are known fuselage configurations so imagine an LB with ducted battery powered propulsion and solar cells. Take it up via balloon detach it at 50k and let it ride the jet stream. If it needs initial forward boost, just apply a small solid rocket booster that detaches when empty. Any RC plane designer can make that. Also, watch whatever the Chinese or DPRK is doing while mil-ops and media are distracted. Do your jobs.
Anything that takes the focus off of Brandon and his son..  Aliens always jump into the news when Democrats are in trouble
I live dead beside Fort Stewart Georgia is this that stupid story where the orbs are flying all over the planet even though I live Dead next military base and haven't seen one orb I guess I'm the one that's lying and out of it right
Speaker is making allegations without a shred of proof. Nonsense and hysteria.
People, stop releasing Valentines Mylar balloons, they trash the environment.
Maybe it was the Kirghiz Light?
CNN the haters don’t know what to hate no problem they are going to tell us they are the hater’s bottom feeders no moral compass no integrity none scum that’s what cnn stands for
This is just fear mongering by bob costas. Everything is Classified Intel in the militree.
CNN👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
About time ET comes to earth to save us from ourselves
It’s an alien craft looking for oil for energy in the North Pole
pilots and military do not talk about classified information apparently just American Presidents selling it to other countries
Project Blue Beam
Alien dad to his kids waking up from cryo, “we finally made it to another planet…we’re just gonna come in nice and easy in this snowy part…”
Let me guess, it'll be reported as a weather balloon.
So what's up with this transparency president?   Still working from the basement apparently.
This was obviously aliens
Just say it! We know their is extraterrestrial life and now they're observing us before we destroy ourselves.
It’s highly unusual for the Pentagon to publicly disclose shooting down an object without even knowing what it is , but describing how the object affected its sensors. This is clear violation of operational security, which tells me that the whole thing might be a distraction, or they expect something worse so they figure what the hell , it’s game over anyway
I already believe these pathological and corrupt liars and manipulators not a single word...👎👎👎
A balloon doesn't fly. It floats.
Aliens 😂
No way its aliens. Our tech would probably be the equivalent of someome throwing a stone at you. Easily avoidable
Roswell!
2023 is gonna be the year of the alien 👽 first public contact is coming soon. 🫣🫳🍿
IT'S RUSSIA DAMMMITTT..
CNN? SCROLL ON BY!
China sent the balloon as a decoy lol will the soldiers have bodycam of the recovery or is the government gonna a protect us from that truth as well?
Making baloons for spying just seems so hilariously idiotic
If they thought it was aliens trust me we would not being hearing about this AT ALL.   No reports from pilots. No news coverage whatsoever
To me, I believe the Chinese have been trying to Surveillance these other unidentified objects this whole time.
UFO's and we just shot two down... are aliens trying to start a war?
Why TF are we having to rely on pilot accounts?... Were all recorded images on every piece of billion dollar equipment somehow mysteriously lost to the cloud?.. Or was it national no photography day? Where is the video? Nothing happens without cameras rolling!... I smell something fishy...apparently when they say there was no surveillance equipment on it, they were talking about every aircraft involved in checking this thing out, and every radar system that picked this thing up... If radar can't see it let's see the radar of our planes investigating and then destroying it.... Get lost.... I guess desperate people will try anything to avoid having the truth come out and finally having to face the music....
they dont know what they shot down?   are we being invaded by aliens?  (eyeroll)
This is all nothing but lies and secrets. I hate the government
when did captains and lieutenants start talking about classified information that is not costing them time in Leavenworth federal penitentiary when you sign the document to join the armed services if you speak out about classified information you go to jail let me guess after this comment they're going to jail right little late aren't we
Why is no news source discussing that the object most likely was videoed from multiple fighter jets before it was fired at. Why is the Pentagon not releasing the FLIR videos???
Either the military is dumb or they intentionally want people to think it’s a UFO. WTF you don’t know what it is?!
We finally shooting down Aliens 👽
The king of the north is probing the king of the south.
Ugh CNN is garbage. It was an accident clicking on them.
So the aliens are Chinese?
This station has built itself on lies and this man leads the way on the most outrageous lies against white Americans don’t know what to hate don’t worry this foul racist man is going to tell you he is part of the hater’s 😢but beware you could be next on there hate agenda
Hope we didn’t shoot down the Black Knight. Perhaps Nibiru is approaching.  Maybe?
Distraccion. Something us is coming. O cover
100m dollar jet and not one video. Bullshit
This makes zero sense, how a “top” Air Force pilot not know what they saw. This sounds like BS!
General Zod is pissed
Wow this clown still has a job
what's wrong slow news weak nobody cares about y'all anymore and were making up stuff 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
E.T. phone home !! Elliott....... my homie!!
"hey Moe, hey Larry . Our buddies in China wanna play games with Balloons! Got any Ideas? Nyuk nyuk nyuk "  "Oh Boy, Curley, you bet we do!!!" "So they wanna play games, Ay?" "With Balloons?"
They know what they saw...they are not supposed to comment publicly...political bosses  should..
No one can say the obvious, that there is a possibility it is not from our world. Information gatekeepers.
It could be a test of new stealthy weapon carrying vehicle to deliver bomb or biological weapons that will used against America!   Why everyone just assumes it is only for monitoring purpose?
NO ! it is  not  unusual for  two or  more  pilots  to see  something  different  ... more  the norm .
False flag alien invasion coming soon
The government knows what it is, they're just tryna figure out why. Will we ever know? Government will never say.We barley handled COVID imagine telling us it was alien's. People will go in a panic especially the nonbelievers,more people would question religion. Normal People will commit crimes thinking it's our final days. Society and stock markets would possibly get hit in a way the can't be fixed. Not to mention toilet paper would be non existent 🤣 💩 🧻
something long & cylindrical🤔 Was it vibrating? Sounds like the USAF may have inadvertently shot up the contents ofTrudeau's nightstand drawer.
It’s a UAP. Aka UFO. Call it what it is.
It must be a flying saucer.
So you confirm this is a UFO and your first response is to shoot it down?? That would be great way to start a war
So it begins…
ET phone home📡
Totally no a distraction from Nordstream. Couldn't be. Lol.
intact lol :)
Plan an simple. Aliens 👽
I told you I warned you about UFOs aliens 👽 coming to Earth, and blowing up these scout ship, later fleet's of UFOs aliens 👽 are coming across the USA and the world, and following this is massive size mother's ship's UFOs,on Earth and like last year, UFOs kidnapping humans and animals is going to continue this year too, but more than last year around the world and larger animals and more groups of humans.  I am telling you today. 2/12/2023. Superbowl Sunday. 11;11am, California time. UFOs will be all up and down the California coast Pacific coast highway.  San Francisco and San Jose and San Diego and Mexico and baha California too.
It's possibly a TicTac craft. A UAP. Made by man.
Close look would have shown Remax.
Ol' Jim...😂😂😂😂🤡
A demonic deception is taking place!!!!
Project Bluebeam is starting. Don't fall for it like you did the you know what.
for all you UFO clowns -  how is it they would have the capability to warp time and travel at the speed of light vast differences across the galaxy -  but would not be able to avoid being seen,  and then get shot down by a missile?  seriously -  get a grip
Is there a reason they aren't releasing any footage or photos of these objects?  They were quick to release photos and videos of the balloon, but for these two ufos, they seem to not want to share any specifics or photos.  They said they tracked it for 24 hours so we must have a massive collection of pictures and videos.  Where are they? Why won't they share them?
Why the FBI?? THERE ARE MILITARY AGENCIES THAT SHOULD BE HANDLING THIS!! RUSSIAN BOMBERS, JETS, SHIPS HAVE SINCE THE 1940'S invaded or made attempts to penetrate Alaskan( USA) air space. We( NORAD) have always chased them away. Radar has never had trouble detecting them or identifying the craft.
They can’t describe what it is , no word can describe it …
Lets go BRANDON
Where the footage?
Were Pretty sure that Canada and Trudo is Safe
We shot down an alien "peace & love" appreciation vessel. The incineration of Earth will begin momentarily.
Flying egg roll?? They said it was cylindrical in shape?? 🤣🤔
Silly humans, we are here from The Nine. We’ve come so far traveled past Io, Titan, Mercury and The Reef. We’ve been studying you for the past 3000 years. We are planning a Leviathan entrance.
Right but why aren't we talking about that chemical spill in Ohio? It seems like we should be talking about both of these
Pentagon, release the FLIR videos  of this object from the F22’s. The people of the USA demand it!
Ok...   here we go.  Everyone grab a shovel.
These reporters should be more speculative. A lot of this stuff isn’t adding up even with the Chinese spy ballon. The ufo shouldn’t even be televised like it is rn CNN so very sus
watch this be some reg person doing this shit
This man is a racist against his fellow white Americans he is a traitor to the nation a foul man who promotes hate against white Americans this station sucks it is a hate platform nothing more please my fellow white Americans turn this station off they need us we don’t need them and this station has lost the trust of the American public turn it off and improve your life
Why would they be telling us about such a thing? This seems very staged.
Suddenly the creation of the space force is making more sense....
I don’t buy it a balloon has no identifiable means of propulsion
Poor reporting:  She says   “Not even the pilots were not able to describe what they saw.”   The military did not say this.   “Take you back a sec.”      (So professional. NOT)   “They sent up multiple F-35s”.            (Wrong!  Just two F-22s)  There is some conflict with what the pilots saw.       (Again BS)  “They intend to recover the debris .   (Then she says later they are examining the debris.)  This poor reporter is very sophomoric  in her reporting.  In fact, she’s not reporting she’s just regurgitating quips from different sources typical of today’s generation.  This is typical of CNN. They don’t do any reporting, they just tattletale and provide rumors and innuendos.
Acosta ... if you stay out of politics you are much better....
really sounds like the guest was reading a script
Amazing, no mention of Canada as that's where the 2nd balloon is downed 🤯🤯🤯
Don’t let this distract you from the environmental catastrophe happening in Ohio right now.
Just look at the photos that were taken.
what the hell is going on here.. sounds like Independance day to me.   Russia, Usa, Canda and China are shooting these things down...
"Shiney Object"
I hope we aren’t making a mistake shooting them down! If these are aliens, they definitely will see this as hostile! I’m scared! 😅😢I’d prefer the balloons 🥴
What pilots? Who released their statements? The FBI is taking the lead on this? Not DOD , I call BS , and a great distraction We can't get a straight answer on why hunter is not in jail for lying on a federal firearms form. Now all of a sudden the pilots are speaking out  What better way to instill fear in us and blame it on the Chinese , ... BS ...
🇺🇸🇺🇸🤘😎🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Probably a Starlink satellite that reentered the atmosphere. That, or an alien space creature is laying eggs in our atmosphere and we just pissed momma off.
Ain’t UFO 🛸. They wouldn’t have the capability to shoot it down if there were extraterrestrial 👽…
..the aliens are very pissed..
Why is the FBI covering this rather than the military? Asking because I don't know; don't want to start anything.
I think it’s a UFO and no one wants to admit to it.. It’s not from here
🎉🎉
Who names a place Deadhorse? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As if they will ever tell us the truth.
tell me they must have cameras recording their fly by and they aren't relying on recollection.. come on now..
This aggression against aliens is unnecessary. I miss the days when we just toom pixalated black and white videos and left them alone
Great.  It might have been an alien scout craft from a planet of beings who have the power to annihilate us in a heartbeat.
Mach 6??????
THE MEDIA IS "TRYING" TO DISTRACT US.. THEY WON'T..
The speed? So what they can’t slow down… Yes it’s a mystery.. But we won’t get the entire truth.. Just what they want us to know
Can't believe Trump didn't punch you
they can pay 200million for a plane but not throw in a go pro..
China probing for weakness and conducting a recon mission to assess US response.
I can just hope your poor Pres Biden was not in command of this operation.
Does she ever breathe?
Even if it were aliens they would never ever admit to it being aliens
💩💯💩
If you can shoot them down they are not dangerous and they are not made for some serious spying
But was there really any confirmation there was something there?  That’s the question you need the answer to
I think it could have been a glide vehicle of sorts…like the ones the Chinese and Russians claim are “Nuclear Capable”. That would explain the high speed and lack of a propulsion system.
We’re being told what the Military “Wants” us to hear 🤷‍♂️
Did you see the lasers coming down from the sky scanning Hawaii???
Cnn so we know this is the truth
Yasser ufos
Oh great, the FBI is taking over 🤣🤦
kinda feels like Unit 731  would not be hard to send a bio weapon  just saying sleep well lol
Pilots? They only sent one plane….. that only holds one pilot.    More fake news CNN
How does this fall under FBI jurisdiction??
It was a Tesla.
There was no visible propulsion because it was a balloon. Most likely made of mylar (which is why it was shiny), and at that altitude most likely a foreign simple weather balloon. Not all weather or atmospheric measuring balloons have the same shape or composition for various reasons.
They’re here
Do the pilots,not understand helium,in a balloon.Maybe,they need a field trip to Party City.
Aliens aren't making a return visit after this welcoming party.
False flag from our govt.
Why do I watch this fake news BS
I wonder if this has to do with Russia building up in the arctic.
We need Fox and Scully on this
FBI will be done by next year. So don’t get your hopes up we’ll forget about it.
when did we start tracking this object? . Also why hasn't any other country  reported these objects?go back and check the flight pattern:
Jet streams ...high speed ...repurposed technology...
Did we just start an interstellar war?
Aliens.
Distraction....before the real event. China owns us.
Thats crazy!!
Is it alien??? Ooo click bate trap. Fell for it again.,
Ufo
It’s the alien people giving us the technology to stop Putin and China in their Nuclear threats , when the Allies get the technology together it will prevent ww3
It was probably the Resident Alien
Can we just accept the fact that America is not the only country and not the most advanced. It’s obviously from China
Idiots ...A dirty bomb, also known as a "radiological dispersion device," is defined as a conventional weapon that has been augmented with a radioactive material.
You know what the Ancient Alien cabal would say these strange flying objects are!!!
I won't be surprised if they shot down a home made air balloon 🤣 LoL...
Time to face reality, 🇺🇸 spends 700 billion, and it can be in huge problem if the number one plastic producer in the world releases 10000 or more balloons at the same time. And no jets or nuclear power can do anything about it. These balloons can disrupt electronics, make a lot of defenses useless, can carry replica of nuclear bombs (and some real). And now that they studied wind patterns it’s not so hard to execute. And all that for a fraction of what 🇺🇸 spent on its war infrastructure. Where is the intelligence now??? SAD!!!
So now to avoid a war they are going to blame it on it being aliens and not a drone of some sort. Think about it, they could have easily said it was another balloon, and most info would be classified. Unless they want you to think non-sense.
They wouldn't have shot it down if they couldn't somewhat identify it.
👀👽
Pilots involved in this mission will make any statements or accounts of this operation.  This woman says the words F-35 and the reports say F-22.  This whole report told us nothing.   “We just don’t. Know”.  Repeated over and over. Then this guy makes a bunch of speculations - worthless assumptions!
I love how all of you idiots are like why are they telling us more information. It's classified, do you want everyone to know what we know?
IT WAS FROM US FROM THE FUTURE TO ENSURE WE ADVANCE IN CERTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE WE ARE TO LATE TO SAVE THE EARTH
We use spy on the Chinese.  And…what’s your point?
Jim still has a job? How? Total fake news.
After everything that's happened how can you trust the FBI
Why don’t we also send balloons to China? There are tons of them in party city.
They are here....🙏🏽
Did Maverick shoot this down?!
Simple the spy balloons are getting what China paid Biden for.
EM Drive.  The Chinese tested Shawyer's EM Drive back around 2005 or so and NASA's Eagle Laboratory followed just because the Chinese test seems to have been a success.  The Chinese have had a few years to work on it.  It's not fighter jet propulsion quality, but it is possible that they got enough output for something like this.
UFO?
Damm, with the chip shortages these lost bus/car size electronic packed payloads must be  expensive when people in china are starving or doing it tough financially. I suppose they can finance it with chinese body parts "organ harvesting" there is over 1 billion of them.
I think we all want to say it’s a UFO but it’s hard to say due to the recent incidents with China
Here we go it's all been written already...
Lmao shoot it down and “diiir where is it at.” It’s not like dropping a fucking guitar pick.😂😂😂😂😂😂
CNN sees everything differently from reality.
The Chinese are the aliens
Nobody panic. At least it wasn't an ICBM.
Pentagon just released the names of the pilots that shot down the UFOs... They are a Randy Quaid and a Will Smith. Spoke person and contributor Jeff Goldblum says more information to be released by July this year...
Doesn't mean they're lying lol give it a break and stop with the conspiracy theories. It was a ufo manned by Martians lol just because YOU don't know what it is, doesn't make it a UFO lol
Probably just a quirky billionaire floating around the world
Maybe it’s George Jetson 🤷🏼
Chinese military has balloons in various areas to scan for anomalies and ufos... Thats why China risked the international tension over their recon tech
Probably china and russia spying US top secret weapon hidding place and a sign of  preparation of war to US power.
It was a CG-U11!
CMON THIS IS ALL FAKE. FBI GOT CAUGHT INTERFEARING WITH FREE SPECH AND ELECTION. NOW FBI IS ON THE JOB SAVING US...   SHHHEEEESSSHH!
It's the new Tesla flying truck, with the new unbreakable glass. Stay tuned!
Who thought we would piss off Russia, China and the aliens at the same time?
We cant trust anything you say anymore cnn
Now the mid-terms are done look for more head games welcome to 2023 the world is a stage and we are being played.
Those fighter pilots are definitely getting men in black style neuralyzed.
Can't the government finally admit that we are not alone! We are ready and we know that we are not alone so come on NORAD. We want the truth!
Jesus   warns  in  revalations   chapter  9  the  final  plague  alien  invasion    pullotion   meaning  the  earth  opens  up  with  all  this  smoke  and   burning  hell   with  demonic  monsters     ships  are  more  and  more  frequently   for  the  last  3  years  God  said  watch  the  skys  and  the  waters        cern  plays  a  big  part  too    sounds like  to  me  there  trying  to  put  blame  again  on  someone     do  you  really  trust  the  pentagon   and  biden  and  them
First, I think all this BS with the objects in the sky is just smoke screen.  China's got hundreds of satellites that could see the numbers on my mailbox from space.  So who cares about a balloon.  It's nonsense.  Second,  if I wanted to know what's really happening, I would never hear it from CNN.
For decades they let UFOS come and go.now they gonna shoot em?
2023 is getting very interesting 🎉🎉🎉
Y'all are being too transparent about this.
Amazon forced to abandon US trials of balloon parcel delivery service 🙄
First the real ufo they can’t even go fast as them much less shoot down. Don’t believe it
Without direct quotes from the pilots, we don't know what they said .. all we got are ignorant newscasters repeating what they think they understood but did not.
This is an opp to distract public from the hunter and Biden crimes and classified docs. They sure went quiet on that. Perfect timing. Plus they want to make Biden to be some hero before elections next year
So they are shooting down drones now? 🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♀️ How embarrassing! No wonder they can't get their stories straight. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Let’s hope it was not a cube they shot down.
They shot it down but don’t have any information from the recovery? Interesting…
We won’t know anything for many many many years and the thermal video from the fighters jets are released. Another tic tac shaped object that makes no noise, has no heat signature and can break the speed of sound without making any noise. Clearly isn’t from this planet… shooting it down is probably a mistake.
When we shoot down a real ufo I bet if u flip it over it will say Made in China
Ahhh yes Jim Acosta another team member of Joe’s WH
FAKE NEWS DONALD TRUMP VOICE ! LMAO 🤣 These people have nothing to talk about
filled with hot gases and from the planet uranus
Alpha Centuri freedom fighters are now on their way. They say that earth 🌎 through its violence has made peace a less likely situation in future.
If it has no jet engine or rocket and its going mock 6 its from the fallen angels labratories.
Very disappointed in Jim that he didn't find a way to blame this on Trump.
They just said there was another one over lake Michigan
Don't shoot em👽
Bob from the CIA.  Tell us what you think.
They shot down a bird.
Its probably something our own government put  up in air. So that Joe can play like he's doing his job. A false flag
Operation Blue Beam is alive and well
So the guest rather casually refers to Mach 6 UFOs that he has witnessed in official capacity that were not resolved and just “put on the shelf?”    Ok.  So this seems like the opening paragraph of “disclosure.”
When all the wreckage is cleaned up then and only then it just be another balloon
Hope we didn’t start an Inter Galactic war !!
It's military sarcasm. They're not going to tell you what it is or what they saw they have a duty to perform and honor to uphold. And before you go there with the cuckoo Puffs theories remember where this is at its in Alaska which is up by the North Pole there's a lot of magnetic interference up in that area and it will f*** with any sensor which yes does include radar.
Natasha is hot
Aliens are white . I mean look at their technology  . They are highly intelligent  .
None of this would happen under trump
We just shot down a UFO!
Are we to believe the F-22 doesn't have a dashcam?  Or that even if not, a cell phone could be duct taped to the targeting system.   C'mon.  There's video somewhere.
Puhleez Natasha is obviously unaware that TWO objects have been shot down in the Northwest. One over Alaska and another over Canada a day later. Last weeks Chinese balloon is old news baby. 40,000 feet is above the clouds and any adverse weather/visibility conditions for pilots to make visual assessments. Which all pilots are highly trained to do. Yeah, youre right the average CNN viewer might have trouble looking outside of a speeding cockpit window but not a professional or military pilot.The reason these trained pilots report seeing different objects, is not due to error or poor visibility, that thing was cloaking itself.
it had weird anti-gravity properties as if it was filled with...helium. they are really trying to milk this for ratings.
Where's Tom Cruise, He Could of Taken A Picture, And The Finger Without Killing. B.S. They Could See 🙈👈
CNN FAKE NEWS !!
We just gave the space aliens a reason to come down and open a can of whoop-ass on us. Stay tuned, people.....
Holy distraction from the fact Phizer knowingly poisoned billions of people.
Chinese weather balloons are mapping the Arctic for the oil because of the melting ice is a theory out there, these so called newscasters have no idea
Sound like a “Tic-Tac” UAP. Maybe one malfunctioned and we were able to shoot it down.
The TRUTH is out there. -Fox Mulder
The pilots are giving different descriptions or accounts it's obviously a UFO and they don't know wtf fuck it is and definitely not from this world but we will never know because our government will change the narrative and also Guys like this one cnn has on like dude this one ant from China or Russia 🤨🙄😏😏
The pilots were clear: The aliens made an offer for the first time to join for coffee and talk about our planets!!
Dont worry guys, its not aliens. Its never aliens. Be skeptic but not so skeptic that you start believing nonsense.
It can't be space aliens because those guys won't let themselves be shot down by primitive Earth monkeys .....
Oh, the same FBI that hid the laptop from the public?? This is a psyop folks. Stop falling for their theater.
Wow CNN, Air force, and CIA would never lie to the American people.
I always told you guys: UFOs are real!! :)
Who the hell believes anything this guy says
I cant believe they are shooting down UFS's now. The aliens are coming the aliens are coming. Im going yo my underground bunker (basement)
I don't think we can rely on Jim Acosta for honest reporting. He's clearly the kind of guy government goes to when they want to spread disinformation.
I wonder if CNN is a credible source of information?
Oh ya because we trust the fbi   Fuck sake
🛸👽: "we come in p.." ✈️🚀💥: "PIECES!"
A Beagle flying a dog house. DOD doesn’t want to acknowledge it took out a F22.
Here we go, biden has started a war with alien
Mach 6? Doesn’t going that fast just kill ur fuel. How can something do that?
What is the big coverup
Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they.
There is nothing UNUSUAL with the pilots having different reports on what it is that they beLIEve that they witnessed! 10 people can witness 1 event and they may all have different versions of what it is that they believe that they witnessed! Fucking reporters always trying to make it out to be more than what it is or is not! Further if this is/was some other kind of intelligence's craft i do not beLIEve that it would have been wise to have shot it down for OBVIOUS REASONS! Further further this stories reports are changing as well! First it's over Canada and Prime Minister Castro REQUESTED thee U.S.'s assistance in shooting it down, & now it was over Alaska which is OBVIOSLY U.S. LAND! SmH!                                  Don't BeLIEve The Hype! 🐂💩🤡's
Rogue mylar balloons from a birthday party 🤣
this was not frozen water at all ....just ice
I'm getting worried 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Search "Spy balloon - I Found China's Dirty Little Secret". This is getting real pretty fast. New pictures show something that looks like a cylinder of a revolver pointed down with 6 points in it which are drones like the one people described as triangle .☠
May we’re not alone🤔🤔🤨🤨🤨
Rutrow. Did they accidentally shoot down a tic tac instead of a Chinese spy drone? Since when do military pilots talk to press? 🙄
forget all your money is going to Ukraine to start a war for the military industrial complex in regards to a pipeline that Russia would make money with putting them in a better position than the U.S. Please get you weather balloon aka Chinese spy balloon aliens propaganda. And let's not question why the mainstream media hires so many former C.I.A and F.B.I people 🙄 🤔. and let's all line up for masking that doesn't work a vaccine that gives us 28 days of protection and another lock down🤨
No pictures why
Vehicles lol
Leave China alone ✊🏾 Coexist ✊🏾🙏🌎☮️💙
FBI does NOT need to investigate
I highly doubt that whatever it was, it was not a threat to ALL  the civilian air traffic near the North Pole. Not to mention im not buying " We don't know what it is, but we fired a $500,000 AA missile at it anyways"
We're supposed to believe anything you guys say? I wouldn't believe you if you told me the sky was blue.
They just wanted to watch the super bowl 🎉
Can they just say aliens
Cover Jeffery case expose those sickos
They, assuming there were as should have been cameras on the planes allowing visual analysis regardless of what pilots think they saw. It could be the their test vehicle New Zealand allowed them to launch that support dead stick drones in line with Rods from God. If you want the video of that particular vehicle I can supply the video of it from a confirmed source.
So it was a ufo
WHO cares what height it was at. There was a device flying over the US territory's. Its obvious that China or Russia is up to no good....as usual. The US MUST be more proactive with these threats. China would be outraged if we were flying a balloon or device over their territory.
Why is this a surprise y’all never seen the movie independents day with will smith lol 😂
Just keep putting China in it, these fools gonna get us messed up. Don’t believe what you hear, even with the spy balloon. It’s all lies!!
It's important to remember that when government employees, such as these pilots possibly, are told during debriefing at times, to not tell exactly what they encountered or saw, but to tell what they are told to. Often times under threat.
Where is joe Rogan when u need him???
I'm so glad they had a CIA guy come on and talk to us about this. I feel so much better now, everything is explained to the extent I need to know, and I don't even need to think about it anymore. (Sarcasm)
Quick question-- what would any commercial aircraft be doing in this area?  We're talking about the Arctic Circle here.  Is there normally much air traffic there?
So how much lies is this CNN.  Pilots on covert missions do not talk 😂😂😂😂🙄🙄🙄. Chinese National Network.
Please pilot's aren't discussing anything.The information goes to military. Damn Biden your pitiful still backs up china. Well President Trump will get it all straight
It’s our’s, idiots.   Timing is everything. Wake-up.
Don't those jets have GoPros? ;)
If they think we are getting all the information and the pilots full account of this object then they are idiots we don’t even know a fraction of what’s really going on
👽
So they can’t even say if it was a fucking balloon 🎈 or if it was a solid craft? 🤡
The FBI is on it?   I thought they only rigged elections.  🤔
III WORLD WAR IS COMING FAST BUT US DOESN'T KNOW IT YET....MILITARY INTELLIGENCE 2 WORDS THAT JUST CAN'T MAKE SENSE...
What a joke this is. It’s not Chinese and they are not balloons, yet that is the CIA narrative that your gonna run with. These same “balloons” are invading Chinese and other countries airspace. A simple “we don’t really know what this is” would be mich better than the lame binary of it’ China doing A or China doing B.
You earthly stupid people will pay for the lives of mine.
😂 it’s hard to take this reporter seriously everything that comes out of his mouth is just bullshit😂 so when he tells the truth I still question it.  What a loser.
What's really going on this is a false flag... what are you hiding
Fake news . I know what they are up2 . NWO lol
Balloon from China? Duh?
Aliens 👽
This is all bullshit, deflecting people from watching their idiot president.
probs from outter space ship
Leave it to the Americans to call a balloon a UFO .
No markings don't know what it is but lets shoot it down and call it a Chinese balloon.
"Look! LOOK! uFoS hAvE LaNdED! No! Don't look at what's happening in Ukraine!"
Aliens are coming
it’s just a cover up job to take your attention away from what’s happening in Ohio
Ufo 👽
UFOs are upset we we keep shooting down their spacecraft. Every time they try to establish first contact we blow them out of the sky.
Nothing more than a distraction.
U.F.O. ???????????
Mach 6 is crazy
We’re all going to wake up tomorrow to giant ships parked over major US cities. Will Smith’s time has come!
Search "Spy balloon - I Found China's Dirty Little Secret". This is getting real pretty fast. New pictures show something that looks like a cylinder of a revolver pointed down with 6 points in it which are drones like the one people described as triangle .☠
Were the correct pro- nouns used when communicating with this trans- object? Was it pen is shaped?
Its all getting a bit weird.
There is no good reason to think this is alien in origin. The simplest explanation is that it is either China, Russia, North Korea or a corporate craft.  Skunkworks has craft years ahead of anything we the public know about now.   IMO, military intelligence officers want the public to think that craft they see are ETs from outer space, so they will spin tales about that, in an attempt to try to hide our own military abilities.    Certainly the fact that the US shoots these things down shows that all those craft flying in our military airspace, that they have not shot down, were very likely black military projects being tested in the field.  My best guess.
I saw six tiny green men last night
Sounds like a balloon 😂
too much speculation
Let us seethe onboard camera of the fighter jets
Lol
Disclosure. Next we have made contact with another smarter civilization.
Aliens trying to warn us to course correct and get our leaders to end these senseless endless wars for profit. Our response is straight out of the CIA playbook.
Even Aliens dislike Corrupt Joe  .
Even if the government finds it, do you really think 'they' would tell us?  If it belongs to another country or is from aliens, they're gonna hush it up and tell us it's another weather balloon,  Most likely dissect it and keep the tech for themselves.
Wats left only bloon bloon every day Vicente bloon Sunday Monday bloon
Why is the FBI investigating it?
Hmmm 🤔❓ I'm not comfortable with these explanations. Sometimes I see past the shrubs.
How about something REVOLUTIONARY like a CAMERA to record the object before we shoot it down.. Even during WWII fighters had GUN CAMERAS..Photo pods are readily available for planes today..And STOP blowing them up.. Shoot holes in what ever is keeping it in the air..  This sounds like a "Once Upon A Time" explaination
My thoughts are that our considering 'if we are ready' is a warped lens. Instead, we should consider, what would our most powerful gain by telling us exactly what is going on, on the chance that this is legit unexplainable and they are worried. Or in the case that this is something to distract or disinformation. Both scenarios do not really include us being given transparency in any substantive way. If it's a disinformation campaign, to scare people or what have you,  we would just get bare bones info. Maybe a couple more strange videos. But never their entire understanding. What would we all do with the info?  They release info only as it seems to serve power in some way,  or when it's an accident it's only ignored when it matters lille. Important leaked info is attack or those who leak are. Watching events min by min always make it seem as info is being concealed as well. Because even if it took only another day, it feels like awhile. Basically we are impatient and foolish to think info would be as fast as a Google search. And we are foolish if we think to trust that info. Truth is stranger than any fiction we draw up, I believe. But await more info.
Unidentified Fallen Angel.
Maybe the Chinese government lost something? It seems they are interested in a certain area. Maybe they lost a submarine near the Alaskan borders....that's probably something they wouldn't want to share with our government.  The balloon/drones flying over our country are probably listening to military "chatter", trying to hear if the U.S. found their submarine...or whatever it is they "lost".
Something is getting pushed here
We are not alone
It takes 2 seconds to tell if its from earth or space.
Military would never let communication out to the public about fighter pilot conversations
Call Ancient Alien experts!🤣🤣🤣
“Roger”……. “Don’t call me roger” …..”surely you’re joking”
It's a device used to gather Intel on our most sensitive spots like nuclear locations. They are gathering this type of Intel in case there is a nuclear war, they will know the spots to hit first. Make no mistake of who the perpetrators are, they are Russia and China.
They forgot to take photos !
Natasha Bertrand is so full of it that it's coming out of her ears.
Dear Aliens, these are not my people. You are on your own now.
It's not a UFO or any of those other bs theories. I'm sure it's some other country tech that they were trying out and it failed.
Does this expert guy not understand that an F35 has advanced sensors, like FLIR that can operate in IR or TV mode. Pretty sure they would have got good data.  Stall speed is pretty high at 40,000 but should be low enough to see what you are dealing with.
All those who followed the events since the beginning, minute by minute, know that something very unusual happened. The object that was shot down over Alaska on Friday was described as cylinder-shaped, metallic, the size of a small car, had no visible propulsion system, and it blew up when it crashed on the ground. The one that appeared over Yukon in Canada had the same appearance, according to Canada's defense minister. Some of the F-22 pilots who tracked the object over Canada said it interfered with their sensors. All these descriptions look very similar to the Nimitz UFO incident of 2004. A while later, the FAA closed the airspace in Montana for 'defense activities', and two congressmen confirmed the presence of an object near Havre and that the US military would monitor it overnight, and bring it down in the morning.  A while later, there was a sudden and complete change in narrative. The Yukon object that was said to be cylindrical is now a "metallic balloon carrying a payload", according to officials, and the Montana object was nothing more than a false alarm, according to NORAD. All these explanations are complete BS to cover up the incident and calm the situation down, just like they did with the Roswell crash of 1947. They first stated it was an actual UFO, 48 hours later, it's nothing more than a weather balloon. The object that was seen over Montana was NOT a false alarm. The radar hits were most likely real, but the objects took off at great speed before the fighter jets got there. So in order to avoid public embarrassment and panic, they stated that it was just a false alarm.
Regardless of what the first hand accounts from pilots that have extensive knowledge of how planes work the government just says. They arnt trained enough to say what they are seeing. Lol. Calling thoes pilots stupid.
This sounds exactly like "The Onions" take on reporting. Some bullshit about some bullshit and recap the other bullshit. 🤣🤣🤣
Was there a Space Force stand down order? Why didn't the Wall keep them out?
Their not going to tell us the truth. . they never do. . like always the Citzen Are in the dark on everything.
CNN is such fake news
Independence day has begun
Flubber is real and this is proof.  Someone was flying a car!
RIP alien explorers 😓
🛸 👽 🤫
Formerly, it was a UFO (Unidentified Flying Object). THEN it was a UCO (Unidentified Crashed Object). Hopefully soon, it will BECOME an IFFO (Identified Formerly Flying Object).
Per an unnamed high ranking Martian official to Earth, the mysterious object shot down by the F22 was carrying the eldest Princess of the Royal Martian family and her children.  The Martian Air Force  have launched their search and rescue teams to locate surviving members.
😂 pilots bragging about shooting at clouds. 🤪
Some other stations are saying it's too dark to find anything
It’s only mysterious because you won’t show us.
ET call home! 👽
It’s aliens
So why is other news stations saying a f22 raptor shot it down? Someone can’t figure out what they want to lie about.
How did they know it was unmanned? What danger was it presenting...could they not have studied it more close up, before blowing out of the sky? Did it have massive propulsion?
This sounds like the UFO details that the Pentagon released a couple years ago. No propulsion system and weird accounts from different pilots.  The object in Alaska is very different than the balloon shot down near South Carolina.
Can we get a whoop! whoop! for Independence Day Resurgence or Moonfall or something similar happening after this?
Omg my neighbour left 3 days ago with a Chair and some ballons on IT I Hope IT wasnt him.
Joe Biden: "Hunter got really high again (approximately 40,000ft); and was mistaken for a UFO. I have taken away his allowance, but I cannot guarantee it won't happen again"
It was a gay pride balloon.
this guy is talking out of his ass. "military takeover" in china with no basis in evidence? and he says the flying object "obviously" had "some kind of propulsion" - but the only direct report I have heard claimed that there was no evidence of maneuverability. which is nerdspeak for balloon.
How much debris could there be for a thin walled balloon. Wouldn’t it just vaporize into pieces
Just another distraction. Nice try media 👏🏼
Y’all we ain’t never gonna hear what this actually was, they’ll be saying it’s a weather balloon by tonight.🤡
" IT IS BALLOON!!! "  Chief Wild Eagle HICKOWII TRIBAL ELDER 🤪
Just pissed off the aliens and predators.
Hahahahahaaa!!!  Great cloaking device! "Chinese military"!!! 😂😂😂
I totally had aliens on my post-Covid world bingo card.
No facts yet but people want to go right to UFO.
Maybe aliens 👽 🛸 can enter our atmosphere because the core stopped spinning , magnetic field
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Hector is going to be running three Honda civics with spoon engines,  and on top of that he just went into Harry's and bought three t66 turbos with nos, and motec exhaust system
Aliens 😂
So it's quite literally a UFO at this point, in the purest sense of the word.  It's even more of a UFO now that even the pilots that saw it still don't know what it is, and it can't be identified from the wreckage either. Incredible! I really hope the public gets a look at this thing.
I have always said that these Martians flying UFOs are nothing but a danger to Chinese weather balloons.
I am a daughter of American officer, and I don't believe this! They are lying to us!
They ain’t goin to tell the truth are u fuckin serious
The Chinese balloon messed up for the aliens ,before the Chinese balloon nobody looked at the sky 😂😂😂
I was woke-scolded that shooting them down this early wasn’t an option…. Thanks ~Jim Eagle
Two possibilities why we don't know yet, pick one.  1) the US govt is incredibly smart and savvy, and knows exactly what these objects are but is not telling the general public because the general public is generally too stupid to grasp a complex subject;  OR 2) The US govt is just as incompetent and ignorant as the general public, and is going to have figure this out one slow step at a time.   My bets are on #2.
F-35 can fly as slow as 100mph, so comments about the high speeds making data gathering difficult are over-stated.
In other words, the government is going to cloud the waters because they want keep everyone in the dark. It's far worse than they are telling. They will hang a nuke on one to attempt to EMP us. This is China or Russia. Do you want to trust their motives? At the same time I trust the FBI to be transparent as much as the Chi-coms and Ruskies.
Eyewitness testimony is famously unreliable.
The technology on this object's have I believe usa do not have. USA doesn't not produce some many things, but another country does. The tec on another country is beyond a lot of us can comprehend.  I am 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
The Great Awakening has begun" are you ready  for for a greater understanding of the universe.  Sleep well.
Can you say Tic Tac. Was this the same type of craft that the Navy could not identify.
WHITE PEOPLE ALSO FOUND BIG FOOT IN ALANTIC CITY😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah guys it's aliens, and in now way the early stages of the third world war. That is the most logical answer
The navy finally got to shoot down a uap in this century. Hopefully they didn’t just start an intergalactic war with some aliens. They’re not gonna be happy with their guys being shot down and that’s for sure. We’d call it an act of war and proceed with retaliatory strikes against various targets. Maybe the aliens will just hold Biden accountable and leave the rest of us alone
Oh CNN You’re killing me 🤦‍♂️
Not even the pilots could comprehend what president Biden said in his last speech
Puppet show people…
I don't think the pilots are allowed to speak out, that's my two cents anyway.🤔
Interdimensional beings
China is laughing it's azzss off because they sent another balloon in the shape of a fighter jet......
As bill Cooper said...in his Book behold a pale white horse the fake hoax that this world government is gonna play up with invasions of UFO 😂 pay attention people this is all part of this agenda 2030 and then they gonna play hologram of the coming of christ 🙄 it's all sick and nuts
So they didn’t ID the craft before shooting down?
According to german news the Chinese Just announced that they also have an unidentified object in their airspace that should be shot down
Whatever they saw, can It be any worse than what we see every day in Washington DC?  It’s a FREAK show down there!  Come on man!
ALIENS
I find it hard to believe this is only happening over the US. The US are just spotting them quicker and shooting them down.
CNN  =  FAKE NEWS.
SHOWTIME
You mean listen to your controlled bs narrative? 🙄
In the past there was drum beats of war, today its the same beat only a different instrument.
How STUPID are these pilots... balloons have NO propulsion... they float in air.  How STUPID are these pilots... balloons don't reflect radar and are same temperature as surrounding air so FLIR is useless.  OK - let's use more $600,000 missiles to shoot down Hoax balloons being sent up by American pranksters and our own weather balloons sent up daily by our own Weather Stations. Every day hundreds are sent up all across country.  How STUPID is the media to regurgitate nonsense.
Project blue beam.
Probe from another intelligent species maybe  hopefuly not are own kind and they are friendly .. I want to believe I need to believe    hope is have big a great sunday
LIES LIES LIES 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s all Bidens fault.
How long before the libturds start screeching that it was  a group of white male Christian supremacists flying it......
This all sounds like a LIE. Just another distraction
Bruh...you gotta be extremely ignorant to not see how obvious this is a smokescreen crisis
UH it was over CANADIAN air space CNN!!!! ..Yukon actually....
“It landed on the ice” yeah I’m sure the ice held up and it didn’t crack 😂😂
Biden’s buddies in China spying on the best way to take America.
wow ,its clear ..... the narative its new now 😂😂😂
Space aliens 👽👾👽
What if there is a Biological canister with Ebola virus in the balloon and destroying it will scatter the virus into the atmosphere all over US.....China is testing US response so they know what types of weapon can be included in the balloons.
I HATE when all the narratives claim “China” as the source and then somewhere in the conversation they say  they don’t know where it came from. Slip up? (It’s PROBABLY China 🇨🇳, but don’t say its 100% China unless we KNOW)
Hmmm.. who had fake UFO invasion false flag event on their 2023 bingo card?
Oh good we shot down a ufo. We’re done lol.
It's china and Russia poking the bear
Coming soon....  Top Gun: Space Force
We going to be at war with Aliens and China.
Season 2023 of earth is looking wild!  Possible ww3, nuclear armageddon, global warming, aliens, brady finally retired.
It was a Jewish laxer searching for Taylor green and they shot it down before the job got done 🤦🏼‍♂️
The most taboo possibility.... 👽🛸🤣
HERE WE GO…
Drone?
Aliens currently not recommending travel over the USA
We are under attack
China...? Russia...? Maybe it's North Korea's entry to the world of going GREEN in delivering their latest ICBM....   :)
I knew it they would’ve kept this quiet had not been for the china balloon thing
Nordstream Pipeline.
What nice shiny objects to take our attention away from other things.

Stop insulting OUR intelligence by automatically saying China and Russia
Kind of reminds me of the 5 blind men and the dead elephant
Not this guy
The objects are Trudeau sex toys flying around
SO WE DONT KNOW NOTHING OKAY??
That this guy totally avoids the notion of non human craft or non aligned craft is loud.  His silence speaks volumes.
was a guy big head small long neck and big belly cobra face
Probably a drone
They're aren't telling us shit, this is all a ploy for votes
The truth about ufos.... they are unidentified, lmao
Dim Acosta
The pilots are speaking out?
The CIA is probably involved somehow. Look how many experiments they have conducted over decades to overthrow countries, destroy innocent civilians, etc. Warmongering at its finest. 🥸
Dam I lost a lot off gf telling them the truth now here we are an everyone is talking about reality..it’s like that love when I was talking no one Would listen talked bad about me
To bad we cant believe a word they say.
I can absolutely say it is not a miscommunication between Chinese officials and their military. That is a communist nation. If u disobey there ur life might come to an end. It’s kinda clear to me that China is hiding technologies from us. They look at what we build. And take time and build things 10xs better and keep it a secret. This became obvious when they built Tiktok to spy on us and try make us depressed and mess with us mentally.
They shot down a UFO and now we are gonna be in a interglacial war.
The public will be kept in the dark, no details will be shared with the people, US Government is too secretive.....stop classifying everything!!!
It was rude regardless.
Nice distraction from Biden allowing a Chinese spy balloon to gather information for days
It's an alien thing. I have pics and videos of the alien. The DOD told me to basically STFU as did my attorney. Dont worry. It was gentle but freaky as F!!! I was wondering how the dam thing got into my room. I'm writing a book about it. You all will see. Eventually.
This is too funny.  Show US some evidence or I call bullshit!
No one has said how fast it was moving. One of the most important detail.
Great, they shot down a UFO and now we can expect retaliation.
So they shot down a UFO/UAP huh? I guess if we hear "oh well it was nothing" it probably was something
"Sounds like something from the X-Files" ha ha ha...  Go screw yourselves media.
A tiny blimp with a small electric propeller is probably another Chinese or Russian surveillance toy. Might be better idea is to hit it with a bullet or two rather than blowing it to smithereens with a sidewinder missile.  Reverse engineering it would be easier with bigger recovered parts.
Everyone sees Biden’s weakness
I said 3 days ago it was a ufo  sure now ya did it they will be coming now in mass
Let's go Brandon!
Sounds more like Roswell than X-Files to me...we'll never know the truth
I'm sure they knew exactly what they saw. What they were allowed to say on the other hand is totally different.
Call them UFO's you cowards! Technically accurate and fun.
F-35 or F-22?
28 February 2023 uk attom boom blast finish uk so go to run intelligent all uk people go to Africa

Welcome to the planet Earth No, it's just some old nut jobs in the PLA sending us a message.
CNN is garbage
I don't see why they can't show the video the pilots took when they went up to get a visual ID?
We just started space war.
I hope we didn't just shoot down an outer space aircraft and possibly start a battle with aliens from outer space. And will we learn the truth ?
Fake News
Good game boys! Keeping us safe 24/7
I think the spy balloons and everything has been a lead up to them announcing the actual origin of those crazy UFOs navy pilots have been seeing. I think this is all calculated.
Groom Lake puppies gone astray is all. 😉🖖
Anyone else in love with Natasha? 😬🥹
This could be the new way of not telling the public the truth of what is going on just spreading the different versions out there in all kinds of sorts of stories
Wake the fu$& up peeps!, we have never been alone… someone should just start rewriting our history now cuz everything we’ve been taught/told has been a crock o shat.  Come on. Don’t be so naive.
Extraterrestrials....👽
I don't think now is the time to piss off ET
Seems to me like the US finally figured out how to reverse engineer the UFO tech bob lazar was talking about.... Theyre testing out their new toys' durability ;)
It is starting to sound like it wasn't another balloon. What was it really?
Remember folks.  There are zero civilian balloons in china!!  The ccp, Chinese communist party is in complete controll!!
😂 space aliens? Teddy phone home
Here's the real story https://youtu.be/jqD6cLhb_MY
Welp if the FBI taken over the case we never getting the truth god damnit😂
Not from this WORLD !!!
you don’t want to get carried away but you went ahead and sensationalized it anyway by saying it was like something out of The X-Files. Way to not get carried away.

Any little green men located?
I have a feeling Russia wants to take back Alaska.
That's Balon's son, damn you, murderers.
Some people said GOD never created the earth how so the earth was here before you people and I
1st the Chinese spy balloon, we know what that is and China accepts it's theirs.  2nd, car sized, by some reports tic-tac object shot down in Alaska. Pilot reports UFO messing with electronical equipment on plane and also having no propulsion.  3rd, the next day, a cyclindrical metallic orb shot down in Canada.  4th, today China also spots a cyclindrical UFO over its territory and plans to shoot down. And almost forgotten  5th, last month Russia claimed to have shot down a cyclindrical UFO over its airspace as reported by Newsweek.   All that with the US government openly investigating UFO or UAP because of nearly daily contact with these unknown objects with US military. These flying UFO orbs are being seen all over the world (at high altitutde and ground/water level) and we have no explanation of what these things are. Maybe now someone can shed some light on these UFO probes.  Perhaps one of these options: A) unlikely since US/Canada/Russia and now China experiencing these things but possibly a government spy probe B) also unlikely but plausible, high altitutde balloons C) some kind of unexplained natural phenomenom D) space probe that traveled from our future to our time E) the 2nd coming of Jesus or other religious godly being is upon us, as prophesized, within a generation of the Jews settling in the holyland F) alien exploration and the preparations for First Contact (with the civilian population) G) someone experimenting with high-tech drones H) space junk I) AI controlled objects
Quit shooting down Krutonian tourist ships. They come in peace!
Im not gunna say it was aliens but it was aliens😂
oh oh, aliens.... they're mad we didn't follow natural laws.. ;p
An interesting story.  Not one I want to trust CNN, FBI or CIA to tell us the truth. These are end time events that most people don’t want to hear.
Why would China try and humiliate the us so close to a diplomatic visit? That’s unheard of.  ~literary no one.
“Ah one-niner-one niner, be advised, the object appears to say Happy Valentines Eric Swallwell from Fang Fang “.
"No identifiable propulsion" sounds alien to me.  Could it be part of an alien observation network from outer space?   Perhaps there are thousands of these around the world beyond our ability to detect them?
Bullshit this is another gimmick from the USA
what speed was it traveling at?
Oh!  The FBI will fill us in with the truth!🤡

Dude this is too strange UFO 👽
Smoke and mirrors
You think they don’t have the wreckage . You news ppl peddle the government’s lies , half truths . Show us what looks like . A balloon to a unidentifiable craft . Pffft
Sounds like the just Found out about it
Drone?
No proof
there are many ways to capture these objects intact. why are they shooting them down which destroys valuable evidence? are these the jewish space laser MGT says caused the california fires and turkey earthquake?
If trump was in office it would be possible but we have a delusional president as of current, probably attempting to read what Harris types on his bulletin board to say. I can safely say we will not know with those two at the head of anything.
We can not believe any news that comes from CNN they are a corrupt organization.
Yeah at is Russian nuke because alaska and Russian they are neighborhood
Of course Americans need to make something trivial into an exfile story.  Thank god for Canadians and common sense.
She literally didn't report anything new
So our technology is in the same level as our
I trust the CIA guy for sure :P
This is all BS
We come in peac 💥
Ayyyy lmao
CEASE 🔥!
what a click bait.. i thought they will say what they saw but didn’t.
You sure it wasn’t a valentines present for Eric Swallwell from Fang Fang?
I know everyone's thinking it but no one's saying it.. What if they shot down one of those UAP tictac objects that were in the videos the pentagon officially released.  The ones that David Fravor & Ryan Graves of the Air Force have shared their stories about.  I'm not jumping to any conclusions but there's an awful lot of similarities so far.  Hopefully no intergalactic war just started 😂
It was Nena’s 98th ballon . 😂
Mark my words they're going to release that extraterrestrials exist for the sole purpose of putting more power and control over us for some reason I don't know how they're gonna do it but they're going to use this to their advantage. Then again high altitude weather balloon. However I'm more inclined to believe that it's  Extraterrestrial
The Apocalypse is nigh
Oh no the martians are trying invade!
Be shocking if the government allowed pilots to tell the truth to the public about what they saw. If I remember correctly, while yes, they now are told to report what they saw, (where before they could lose their careers), that is only inside gov. information.  Bottom line, you have at least two factions here, our government and private corporations that have been backing UFO projects for decades, and neither feel compelled to tell the good citizens of this country the Truth!
Which is more likely, two pilots trained to observe and explain  what they saw were both wrong.. or the reports are fabricated..
Aliens. Humans just started an intergalactic war. 🤣
Well, Putin seems to have figured out years ago that the right wing in the US would be more accommodating to him than the left, so it wouldn't be a surprise if other nations understand this as well and use this UFO tactic to push American politics to the right by making it more paranoid and hawkish.
Not one journalist is asking; was it just hovering? Was it moving? If so how fast? Basics people. How can they not ask?
It's NOT ALL the ccp.SMH
Now we pissed off the space aliens.  We are really in trouble now. Seriously, we live in a world of drones.  They are all over. In space we call them satellites, but the functions are the same.
Chinese stealth plane. We are now in control on the wreckage. Please China keep sending us planes, Balloons, etc. We love shooting your property down.
It was Hunter piloting a private jet hightailing it out of Ukraine with a cargo hold full of coke, cash and Parmesan cheese before Putin got to it.
We're all so safe under Biden.  Yay  FJB
Maybe some country has technology that we don;t have.
A mysterious cylindrical object approaching on Super Bowl weekend… must be a promotional stunt by a beer company. Busch, I am looking at you. The noise when it was hit: BBBOOOOOOSSSSSHHHHH!!!!
So are we going to war with China or r we just gonna let this go?
Aliens of an ancient timeline.
Would be damn exciting if it's outer spaceship!  Maybe David Bowie knew something we didn't.🤔
It probably was a large drone send by china. The pilot should have taken pictures. The people on the ground should have a telescope to see what it is and take photos of this. Where the brains at of the military or do they know and keeping it a secret.
Just turn it over and look for the 'Made in' sticker.
Still why wasn’t the balloon shot down the same way
Hmm strange object now in the ice? Have they seen The Thing?
Here we go guyz
Sounds like someone has new technology and is testing it ? Maybe they have done this for years and are comfortable now . The last president was Trump right ?
They are blocking us understand
I knew the Grays were traitors since 1948. Double crossing us for the Chinese. Those slanted eyes gave them away.
Sounds like this whole affair will soon disappear, because we all know how the military handle true UFOs...
Extraterrestrial
Hellloooo Natasha
Not of this earth, . . . Keep Watching the Skies !  yukyuk ?
CNN, go talk to George Knapp and Leslie Kean.
UFO.  Is Disclosure close!!?
It’s just a balloon they knew what it was just didn’t wanted to tell us.
Oh great here comes the UFO worshipers now we’re gonna go down that rabbit hole.
China ready to shoot one down
Smh
Just release to video footage or were they not working 😂
One thing is for sure. If it was aliens, they picked a bad time to fly around.
When Aliens send in the peace corps 😮
I'm sure much is classified.
It’s all going to taken to Area 51 never to be seen again
Aliens?????😳
FAKE NEWS PERIOD!!
I don't wanna get technical  .... just says random words... man you can do better than that when your lying to American public
Umm . There was three
Pilots are going to say whatever the government tell them to say😂
N Korea  ?
These aren't balloons....they ARE UFOS!
This is distraction...but why ?
Bla bla bla and say nothing that's not obvious.
This is history in the making 🧐👽
Because the Chinese didn't do it
Shut it Acosta. You and your dem propaganda machine are a huge reason this is even happening. I hope you get what you deserve.
I wonder what they’re trying to distract us from… 🤔
God this 2and guy what  wasted time on interviewing this guy. CNN do better.
It’s funny bc the federal government doesn’t just let anyone fly these fighter planes. These men are top of the top mentally physically… it’s interesting how “they gave different accounts to what they saw” and how this “adds to the mystery” … it’s clear as day this is all a lie. No clarity on it at all, just a lot of garbage .. and it’s all to keep the sheeple going “baaahhh”
You KNOW there was “dash cam” video from those planes.
Here we go as if Joe biden was not enough problem now we gonna have gray's here to who else did he let in
Elan musk's car in orbit?
For some reason, if they thought it was a UFO, they wouldn't be covering this story🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
UFOs and Aliens are made in China?
Chinese Scanning The Area For More American Land To Purchase  Only Cash Deals Please
dumbest. story. ever. keep looking at those jingling keys, babies.  expect the m.i.c. to ask for a 'balloon force' with a 10-figure budget.
Is this the episode where Americans can't get along, quick, get the aliens!
"Frozen Water" is that what we used to call ice?
How does a giant balloon hover at 40k feet 🤔 Must be aliens🤯
Remember the twilight zones episode of these friendly aliens who looked like Lurch and gave a book to the humans. And alot of people showed up to get on their craft to take a ride. And a scientist rushed to the take off zone they cracked the book and yelled "it's a COOKBOOK". If they eat M traitor green and bobo they'll get heartburn!
This is why aliens don't visits us, we will shoot first and ask questions later.
Aliens need to understand that the Texas border is where they can come into the United States without being stopped by the government.
Since the CNN employees were also stating as fact that President Trump had Russian assistance to be elected in 2016, this reporting is about something, but that something is not a mysterious object in the sky.
Welcome to CCP's new UFO class BALLOON.
....it's a weather balloon incoming.  With pictures of some old photos.
Interesting that all the sudden a bunch of ballon’s showed up to shoot down after Biden fucked up the first time.
How fast was it going
It’s unidentified, it’s flying and it’s an object. I wonder if someone could come up with a decent acronym for it?
Deadhorse!  Biden shot down a Freaking Horse!  Where’s PETA?!?!?!?
I have no doubts that they know what they saw. the public isn't ready for that type of information I'm sure.
And this is why we have UFO sightings: because it's not always easy to identify what you are looking at, especially at those speeds, under stress, or through limited sight, weather etc.  Bottom line is this: Just because you don't know what it is does NOT mean you know what it is.  UFO does not mean alien by default.  To quote/paraphrase Carl Sagan: "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence".  In the mean time, we have to accept that we cannot always explain every strange looking thing we see.  It doesn't mean it's aliens.
Right after state of union speech
The public show know soon! 🤔
Rip aliens...
Hey i make metal music about um... "Chinese drones" ;) https://youtu.be/8TudXOJoJPg
Of Biden wasn’t enough now aliens 👽 great…..😅
There's no cameras on these million dollar jets?  By cameras I mean Slow Mode resolution,  or something advanced like that. I understand the speed they are traveling,  but there has to be some technology to record....🤷‍♂️😵‍💫
Why has no one showed a pic of the second one?
The irretrievable losses of Ukraine are about 500,000 people today. About 300,000 of them were killed. Soon Ukraine will be divided by agreement with the owners of Ukraine-the Americans.
UFO ?
You can't make this sheet up... LoL The u.s. government are such liars.
Great shooting down alien aircraft 🤦‍♂️ guess we better get ready for Independence Day
They’ve landed. 👽
And don't some of these aircraft have verticle take off mode? Aka hover
Aliens are now gonna be pissed that they are now being targetted amid all the mix up with the Chinese.
liar's and hypocrites
👽
Why was there thousands of pictures of the balloon and not 1 from “this object”. From here it sounds like a lie
Mhmm mhm 😆 🤣 😂 😹  we know what's being hidden,  just say it
Hopefully ET has come to take Marjorie Taylor Greene home
Aliens, please don’t kill me
Being raised in the military, I do not believe the pilots would even speak out on this classified mission.
The big ship will be here soon get ready it came space dummy just say it already
These aliens better be of the lady of the green dimension caliber lost in space  “ pretty doctor Smith “ and not flintstones the great Gazoo little green guy type
The truth is out there!
I think I saw this movie THE THE THING
It was a Mylar Valentines, balloon from Kroger.
I love how the media is being careful not to call it a UFO even though it most definitely was an Object that was Flying and is currently Unidentified. Sadly, had they called it what it was, a UFO, the general public would have gone berserk and interpreted the statement as "Aliens from the planet Zark are attacking the Arctic!!! Hide your children!!!".
I call bullshit on it all.
China it’s invading us CNN fake news nobody believes your shit shut down your channel better
One pilot said he seen 👽 inside
Total bs. No way we don't know where it came from
Aliens
😮
The air force has known odout the un identified  aircraft there are lots of them I think the guys name is Ryan Reeves he was on Joe Rogan last summer
So you're telling me that muliti billion dollar plane doesn't have a camera on it?
Covid delivery platform.maybe.haven't Russians been active up that way..or it's the others
Debris=not intact
Maybe the Aliens are non-binary and transexual
They are only guessing. Those military pilots are not allowed to comment in any way, shape or form about that mission. Also, why are we surprised by this. Biden has proved in his 43 years in office how completely weak and worthless he is. His only goal is to line his pockets
Jim. It's all Trump's fault. You gotta chase that down.
Intergalactic war coming soon. Earth is doomed
I wonder were they're hiding 'dem aliens.
One told the truth the other told what he was instructed to say!
I'm sure beings with the ability to traverse huge distances could avoid an F-22. So this is a BS story. They know exactly what they shot down.
We really just messed up first contact didn’t we.
How do you spell UFO?
People said our Mother made us how does a woman have a baby without man even without him there
How to create a false flag ufo attack 101. #137 Test the waters with stories of a takedown of a UFO and allow the media to speculate.
What the unidentified flying fu*k is going on here 😳
If the FBI is investigating it then you know they will tell you the truth.😶
CIA guy said so much to makes zero sense. Typical for CNN. No wonder they’re tanking.
Spiritual warfare...
Thanks for this report. More please!
Finally America is getting tired of illegal aliens.
I see what type of military tools and firing capicity the US has and what type recon system is in place.
Sensationalism and a HUGE DISTRACTION. Wake UP PEOPLE!!!!! SMDH
Haha Didn't the military say they shotdown a weather balloon in 1948 Roswell New Mexico!!
Lol
Chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one they said!
Great.. we just shot down ET…. Lol
FBI has hands on it?… that’s the last you’ll hear of it
Slow motion object...across country.   😆
China testing our military & our President reaction.
Maybe they saw election fraud like we did in 2020.
The libs media trying to distract from Pfizer veritas, Twitter files and nordstream pipe.
We will never get the truth about it  and conspiracy theorist will be going down a rabbit hole now over this
Satan is messing with  you pagan tree worshippers.
There have been many reported cases of UFOs flying over Ukraine so could this have something to do with Russia.  Russian authorities reported that the crews of four separate passenger planes claimed to have had an encounter with a UFO above the city of Volgograd last week.
The government has nothing but problems.
If you are following this you are part of the problem
It's starting to sound like the United States has no home defense , the ocean is now obsolete.
China is probing US defenses IMO
Ufo
I saw a huge black triangle with 9 lights last april...
Well they could have shot it down and not tell anyone - most probably nobody would have found out …. So why are they showcasing it is the question to answer here …
UFO 👽 BOOK 📚✏️ IT
What a joke!  Thank God we have the US military to protect us from spooky ghosts!
space junk returning
it was  aliens people XD
So the Biden criterion is "does it show a direct threat to civilians".. Presumnably thermonuclear weapons would  not?  How do youy tell?  So, the air crew could not see what it was, so its OK - Biden did his job, not!  Just let them threw until the public and non MSM media become upset.  Meanwhile the late shot down aiur balloon was destroyed by the missile and water damage, so sortry I can't tell you what it was.
What a mish-mash of probably erroneous speculation ! But one thing is for sure : if it has extra-terrestrial origins all kinds of wacky explanations will be aired( as they have been since the 1940's)
Proof that UFOs exist.
How about using dashcam?
Now that the object is on the ground. Why not just take pictures of the debris and release the images so we can see for ourselves? Similar to when FBi takes pictures of evidence they have just seized!
I bet they had some crazy stuff on them.
Why did they not take a picture?  Seriously everyone has a cell phone attached to the pockets.  I think Russian.
This is the 3rd object
UFO ..Alien from Asia is hereeeeee
Wtf guys…I think this heightened sense of security due to China. We may have just shut down or “UFO” two of them actually…us ufo uap nerds are geeking out js
Frequency hopping has to do with crypto in radios. It doesn't effect a plane sensors. Where the fuck does CNN get these, subject matter experts....
Those pilots are lying about what they saw. Probably told what to say.
So u dont have any type of camera infrared gamma ray ect
It’s everything we have a fear of…BIOLOGICAL ++++++++ attacks
Alien invasion
You fly abeam of an object,  you have all the time in the world to see what you're looking at.
Don't worry. The alien mothership will be here in a few days to find out why you shot down their smaller ship.
These last few weeks events ain't suspish af at aaall 🤔
Wow! China is taking Weather and Climate so seriously now.    Sarcasm.
I'm sure this will be covered up with some BS.
An object that cannot be identified, affects pilots instrument’s, and cruising with no noticeable propulsion? We are all thinking the same thing folks!
It’s all a lie. Just the next chapter in the series of information they want us to consume.
Wake up, you are getting scammed ... again. All fighter jets have several different cameras, all have recording potential. Why not just look at footage???? Its a bullshit story to cover some movement.
Is this our Roswell New Mexico moment?
What are the coincidences between these flying objects up in the arctic and all the new Russian bases being built up there?
Is it possible that those fighter jets had no video, camera on board????? Definitely strange but they will not say anything until they know what and where it came from
NORAD is worthless!!
Don't piss off ET.
Well, these probes could actually have been sent from the balloon they shot down earlier
Cina , Russia Corea , India,+COVID,war Ukraine, balloons, drone Iran what next.
BIDEN: "IT MIGHT BE FROM MARS; I BETTER KEEP QUIET BEFORE I GET INTO TROUBLE." CNN: "IT'S DONALD TRUMPS FAULT".
Cnn is as close to a wolf in sheeps clothing as any metaphor can hope to be.   The only way to make it better is "devil in disguise"
It was a solar balloon, if you've never seen one before, take a garbage bag outside and fill it with hot air from a blow drier, tie it off and let it go, presto, you've got a shape-shifting, unidentified, flying object that can reach heights of 30,000-40,000 feet for under $1, that costs the military $100,000 to shoot down.
It's almost as if they have some kind of agenda? But no, not with someone as strong, honest and clear-minded as Biden in the white house...🤡
What about the lasers in Hawaii???
How can you shoot down something you cannot see?
UFO 🛸
Bring in Acosta and the CIA to clear things up and report real news . . . NOT!
Like we'll ever hear the truth...
Hhhmmmmmm....Well, let's see, China is sending balloons which suggests their tech is extremely outdated and Russia is still relying on old weapons from the 80's. So do you really think either of these countries has something that can fly all the way over here with no known propulsion system? Yeah, it's not from either one of those countries.
Here the aliens come where's Scully and Mulder?
ALIENS!!!!!!!
It’s no UFO, but it is a prelude to an invasion.
CNN IS A HOLES.  But ill add that one of the eyewitness accounts from a certified pilot of the original bal0oon was that it rapidly descended 2000 feet in a couple seconds.
Teasing @hulu J'vais prendre ça @taranisnews Et l'foutre là @nasa Ouais ! c'est moi 😑
UFO
Where are the pics
Sounds like fake news
It has all the trademarks of a scam. Fearmongering with an "unknown danger". Does the "unknown C*v*d virus" scam ring a bell ?
It's an Object... It's Flying.. It's Unknown... it's an OFU!
Video please
This is all nothing but a distraction to direct attention away from our crumbling republic.
FBI taking the lead!? oh, we’re screwed now. Those guys can’t do anything right all they do is lie to us. They’re just government goons.
I don't believe a fucking thing about anything I hear it see on TV YouTube or anywhere else unless I've seen it with my own eyes and I still question the things I've seen personally because I was high but regardless of that doesn't mean the objects were not there one sighting was in Arizona near Red Mountain they're were three orbs quite large the largest being on top then a medium orb then a small one in a vertical pattern the largest above the others back around 2007 or so
You can slow the speed of a jet.....they know damn well what it is they saw.  As did their onboard cameras.
Well they killed ET....again😞😂😂😂😂
They have it on video. Why would they release the Chinese balloon footage so quick but we get nothing but stress with this one? Hopefully, it's alien, and they came to begin taking away the MAGAets and relocate them on a different planet! If that's the case, sorry for shooting you down on your honorable mission!
I hope they don't shoot down somebody's ufo craft
@CNN ...Something is wrong with her microphone...sounds distorted.
I'm not saying it was aliens. But it was aliens.
B!  S!  Everyone is trained to fly billion dollar crates, but NO ONE can identify them.🖕🏿And not a word about the folks who RECOVER the “item”.    GT ENTIRE FOOH!
Just because it’s a UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) doesn’t mean it’s an Alien.
This is starting to sound like upcoming disclosure. To get the people of our world to turn our minds to something else than the state of things. Also, if it is something with no propulsion then we didn’t shoot it down. Likely it would be something that has already crashed and they act like we shot it down but we have been having it our possession.
ET visited and we gave it a welcome punish.
Not a good look on behalf of humans if they shot down an Alien aircraft
Ope new “current thing” just dropped
It was supposed to be our first contact with peaceful aliens, but we shot them down.
So, we have maga here.. they might have mcga there too? Lol
"It's dem aliens!"  Lolololol
What if it's a probe from a different planet? Now what do we do? I'm just saying as of the moment we have no idea soooooooooo...
Can’t trust FNN even the janitors working there can’t be trusted !
LOOK AT THE SKY LOOK AT THE THINGS IN THE SKY DONT LOOK DOWN DONT PAY ATTENTION TO WHATS AROUND YOU LOOK UP AT THE SKY LOOK AT THE SKY LOOK AT THE THINGS IN THE SKY DONT LOOK DOWN DONT PAY ATTENTION TO WHATS AROUND YOU LOOK UP AT THE SKY
Is this the soft intro to aliens? Lol
It's alien. We are starting a war with aliens.
Hmmmm, maybe it's a spere like from the knowing.Adam eve story this dimension is coming to an end
My prayer no misery 💘 😂.. Dear leaders worldwide please accept that advice from the people who are at the aviation industry is very important for the people of the world today no misery 💘 ➕➕🅰🅰🅰➕➕ 🍀🍀😊😊😊🍀🍀 📖📖🙏🙏🙏📖📖
Ooooops...!!!! We just killed the Allies peace ambassadors 👽🙈🤦🤦.. we know they will be here soon right...lol
Mysterious? Communist China knows America has become too unpatriotic and politically correct to face the threat that China is our enemy and we need to eliminate human surveillance vehicles (Chinese students) first and shoot down surveillance balloons with 20mm rounds (not missiles) and enable them to descend slowly. The fact that they seem to still be searching off SC proves they carried out the intercept in a rush and needed to be on this from the first few minutes of airspace violation.
Psych It’s a weather balloon 😂
🛸
B/c a superior intelligence that can traverse star systems is gonna be taken out by a glorified firework? Ya ok CNN take it easy on the sensationalism...
Trust me they're going to be unveiling all types of UFO activities and saying that they are real The government is slowly about to push this into play
Maybe a distraction above as Chinese submarines sneak near U.S. shorelines!
You know if CNN is reporting on something, somewhat honestly, then something’s up. Not trusting how they’re portraying these developments.
Let's see the reckag , let see the videos let's see the crash site,if you don't have that it's just A storytelling
It might be St. Valentine's Cupid? He flies around this time of year.
JUST TELL US !!!!  STOP STALLING
I hope everyone prepping, cause God only know how this year and many more to come if we make it to see it.
Why all this fuss and shenanigans!?, just because they shot it down?! This things happened several times subsequently prior to this
Keep them entertained. Give them a stupid reason to look the other way.
CNN = CHINESE
Have these guys not got video, or phone footage??……Just show us the pics man!!
Ouuuch!! Elliiiottt!!
Trash > cnn
CNN must spend fortunes on makeup. It makes their hosts look totally ridiculous.
"What's that?" "Drill's getting too hot from all the hippies!"
Was the pilot Tom cruise 😂🤣😂🤣
UFO 🛸 encounter! The government is preparing us!
Panicked 😂
Sounds like they're distracting the government from something else sounds like to me probably another
aliens
Why would you say 'near Alaska rather then over Canada, which is where, in Yukon,, it was shot down at the Prime Minister Trudeau's order or request through NORAD.
SPACE LASERS
Natasha is so beautiful..😍🥰
Project blue beam
Bye Felicia 👋
They're here. 👽🛸
Have u ever seen watchmen just alert all the world leaders so we can prevent the inevitable nuclear war
New it all along the shot down aliens.
Take Me To Your Leader!🧛‍♂️
THEY ARE NOT BALLOONS
Well balloons don’t propulsion.
What’s going on in Ohio tho?
this is how our government will justify entering into the next war.
That’s why I never drink and fly. 🥃x ✈️ ✔️
War of the Worlds ..
Those balloons are a test to find out reaction time, I would add in this comment that also  they could be carrying biological weapons- viruses. They also could be a distracting movement to allow them to move something else, closer to key locations in US. Balloons could be coming from Northwest while submarines could be coming from East to the Atlantic Ocean or even on Cuban territorial waters into the Gulf of Mexico. Do not let absolutely nothing get into US waters or Airspace under any circumstances, specially from those dictatorial regimes. That's a NO-NO.
And the other ufo is now seen in china's yellow sea 🙀the chinese military is preparing to shoot it down now just imagine 😆😆there are more of these objects coming from nowhere
Sorry I Tim the toolmaned the missus vibrator and it took off
Deception at its finest. Don’t let this garbage scare you. Trust only in the lord. Glory to god, he gave his son to pay the price for us. God is truth.
The fact is CNN is talking about it, do you know it’s not reliable information.
If that’s true then they didn’t shoot it down.
Balloon and cylinder frying object. More danger than f22 in future war. It can install small nuclear EMP. Electro magnetic pulse device. Once detonate from the sender. It will knock out entire areas air and ground electronic equipment without function for  2 years. Can't reinstall or replace it. F22 lost communication no function inside equipment.
Top secret documents mismanaged and suddenly foreign balloons yes right.If it's not big ba
When you have a documented classified clown as president. Expect a lot of balloons flying around.
I'm confused. Where's this pilot they're talking about?
UFO
It does not give an intelligence advantage yet. They are recording as much eavesdropped data as possible. Because within the next ten years quantum computers will be able to decrypt most of it. So if they record it now they will have the data soon. Any data that is not encrypted on a quantum level will be accessible soon they just have to record it and hang onto it for a while.
👽👽👽👽...Ouch
Start re-arming very fast. That makes 5, the first 2 went undetected until recently looking over past radar monitors.
👽👽👽
The stage is set my friends
I guess this is a case for x-files.
Now ET is gonna strike back
If only we had a real president and administration.  It’s scary how vulnerable USA and its people are since that fool was put in the WH.
They know exactly what it was, they detected it 24 hours before they shot it down, per their own statement, so you mean to tell me that the united states military had 1440 minutes to fly , below,on top ,on side,  and around an object and somehow nobody got a good look at it, but shot it down anyway... Yeah ok👌🏾
Any mass shootings yet today in fail nation? 🥱
If you think your going to fuck with Canad/usa ? YOUR WRONG AND YOU JUST COMMITTED SUICIDE
Xi Jinping got away with this 4 times under Trump because Trump is his bought and paid for bitch. Now there's a new sheriff in town who's shooting them down. Way to go Joe!!!🇺🇸
And why not a controlled stall near the object to get a nice long look at it and take pictures.
Could they be diffent shaped balloons coming across pacific from chinese new yr celebration
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's superman!
moc 6 made no sense? yes it does if your from Zeta Reticula.
Don't know what to fear more. Some UFO or some Russian or Chinese FO.
We are not alone😳🛸
Cool anyways
Can’t be a “real” ufo, we can’t shoot them down
Extraterrestrial lol
And you wonder why they don't tell us everything up front🤔🙄
Meanwhile Biden removes a majority of our surveillance blimps at our Southern borders, and keeps on funding the war in Ukraine! Impeach him now!
I knew it its from Mars, Mar's Attacks next we headline!!!!!
This is just like the tic tac incident in 2004. Cmdr Fravor! Please come chase the tic tac! 😅
There's a bar in Dawson City up in the Yukon that will sell you a "Sour Toe Cocktail" with a preserved human toe in it (originally from a Klondike gold miner who froze it off). Just wait 'til they can offer it with Alien body parts from the crash site near by.
This is a non starting story a object 40,000 f. At Fighter jet speed... 🤔 New journalist trying to make her name for herself by creating a story out of the smallest misaligned detail
It was a UFO just say it ffs
Has anyone called Elon, get his ass involved immediately
I find it quite significant the US military and everybody else supposedly investigating this are not only acting notably ignorant, they are now talking about conflicting assessments from pilots, and we are NOT being told very much. We HAVE the technology to know damn well what these object probably are, we are being kept in the dark?.."they just don't know"...for heaven's sakes!! our advanced spy planes and a lot of other fighter jets have approached and followed these objects!! We have advanced technology, by now I think they DO know what this is about (they KNOW, but we are not going to get a straight answer) I advise folks to be VERY CRITICAL of whatever our officials eventually tell us, this sounds very suspicious with the spotlight on not just on China, but even our own military and officials, they had better be pretty damn convincing when they start "explaining" what has been happening, I fear we may not get a even a 50% truthful explanation...
It's a distraction
Which is it F 35 or F 32
Hopefully they don’t pull a Roswell and tell the truth
WILL YOU FALL AGAIN TO THE FRAUDULENT MEDIA? With the LIE-19 test, they found you are infected with their 19 mutations and continue their scams. Left and right are controlled and play the game for the NWO masters. The WTC collapse was their movie show and they actually used nukes in the foundations of all three buildings. Dimitri Khalezov explains this to you. THEIRS UFO TEST "Alien Invasion' Radio Broadcast Terrified Listeners 84 Years Ago. Would E.T. Contact Cause Panic Today?"
We cannot allow Chinese spy objects flying around in Western airspace. Get it down.
So no on board video on the most advanced fighter jet in the world?
By definition it is an unidentified flying object, doesn’t mean alien.
The conflicting account is from the reporting.  Are they looking for an angle with this kind of coverage?   It was what they experienced with sensors that differed.  Also they were not able to identify a source of propulsion. That's pretty much it until they recover it. Filler story. "Mysterious."  The pentagon is wary of offering more info because this is what current reporting does with it. Not mysterious.
Wrong guest. He’s so far from the times.
Funny to see that woke liberal clown Acosta trying to do real reporting. Trump 2024!
The only thing that can bring peace and unity among humans, i.e. unite the West, China and Russia, is the attack of Alien forces.
N-am vazut in viata mea idioti mai mari decat oficialii armatei si guvernului american. Ma gandesc cu oroare ca ii consideram garantia noastra de securitate. Ce dracu' e ala "obiectul" zburator? S-au aprropiat de el? L-au observat? L-au filmat si fotografiat? Ce e, pastele ma-sii de "obiect"? Balon? Dirijabil? Drona? Avion? Autobuz zburator? Frigider zburator? Elefant sau crocodil cu aripi? Nava extraterestra? Dragon chinezesc? Ce dracu e ala "obiect", imbecililor?
Was it full of Chinese hot air?
Weird times ahead.Fighter pilots we trust with nuclear weapons their credibility is beyond reproach.
roswell 2.0
So ... we can identify the smallest details of, let's say, the moon ...however, we can't (supposedly🤨) identify flying objects within our atmospheres?  To quote Elmer Fudd, "There's something awfy screwy here."
LET THE MILITARY TAKE OVER F B.I. WILL CONTAMINATE WHATEVER IT IS AMANTEL WE THE PEOPLE WILL IT REALLY IS..
How about the next time we spot one, we track it and see where it goes?
In general Natasha Bertrand is a MAJOR DNC far left hack--of course hired by CNN
Wow this makes me wonder if they shot down some alien family coming here for a vacation😲😂
Absolutely terrific to see Natasha Bertrand on the TV. She is smart articulate and beautiful.
So an object with ECM doing unusual flight patterns... act like it uses the hall effect... yeah that sounds like something the Commies can build when they are using WWII technology.. like war balloons... so yeah.. definitely not Chinese.. if it were something other.. the strategic release of that information.. could stop all conflict on the planet.. at least temporarily... just a thought,,,
It is Wakandan
*_FUN FACT:_*   _At least everyone knows it couldn't be CNN ratings flying so high. Maybe " The Gutfeld " show Ratings._
People worried about Chinese surveillance.......GET YOUR ASS OFF TIK TOK.
People need to understand this about the UAP phenomena: I'm a Marine, served as a HIMARS Operator up to 2021, since then I've been back in school pursuing a degree in Space Studies with a concentration on Aerospace Sciences. Before I enlisted, I studied Aerospace Engineering for 2 years at UAH. And I became the first student in history to have their design built in space during my senior year in high school.   I am not bragging, I'm only outlining how I fully comprehend and understand our technological capabilities when it comes to Aerospace tech, and I served in the military with a secret clearance. I'm not a UFO nutcase, that's my point. So here are the facts:  We have radar data from multiple sources and confirming visual reports from literal Top Gun Pilots surrounding these tic tac and cylinder shaped objects literally breaking our understanding of physics. 90⁰ turns at hypersonic velocities, descending 50,000 ft within a fraction of a second. WE DO NOT HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY. By "we" I mean all of humanity. Russia can't even manufacture modern tanks for their war in Ukraine, so I highly doubt they can build a single UAP, let alone at least a fleet of them.  China is only near the US in technology because they've been stealing US tech for decades. Their own space program uses designs that are blatantly ripped off of soviet spacecraft. Not to mention if China had this tech, you really think they would have used a balloon the size of 3 busses to spy on the US?  Our species can barely achieve hypersonic velocities, meanwhile there is video and photos of these hypersonic craft diving into water and traveling at supersonic speeds, underwater.   There are no other possibilities, the only possible explanation is extraterrestrial in origin. We are not alone.  It is not US tech, for this to be US tech, our government would have to have kept a centuries worth of scientific and manufacturing discoveries secret from the entire world. Not to mention the entire point of military deterance is for the enemy to know you have advanced craft. Denying its existence and hiding the tech will not deter anyone or make the US seem more powerful, if we had that tech tic tacs would be flying alongside F22s daily. That is how deterance works. Or better yet our next gen bombers that just got announced would have used at least the same propulsion system that tic tacs use. It's not the US.  If it is not the most powerful and most technologically advanced countries on the planet, how in the hell can it be anything other than alien in origin? How can it be man-made, when we can't even explain its confirmed capabilities in theory?
The US out pretending like it's bad ass shooting down balloons as Russia demonstrates to the world it has the guts to fight a real war to protect it's sovereignty, how embarrassing for the US as they hide behind their little alliance while Russia and China are poised to win WW3...!!! Not one of these so called experts allude to the fact that if even only one of these balloons drops an EMP it's over for the US, they don't tell the truth...!
In other news....Timmy's birthday party had a balloon that escaped.  Now the USAF launches a nuke strike at the party.
Trying to paralyse the  Nato  Defence? Testing , testing.
Aliens
This CIA guy expects us to believe that trained F35 pilots wouldn't be able to tell what an aircraft is because they're flying too fast....
Absolutely terrific to see Natasha Bertrand on the TV. She is smart articulate and beautiful.
I find it really hard to believe that Xi could be unaware of what is happening or that he didn't give his permission to carry on whatever the hell they are trying to do. I think the most plausible explanation remains that they want to see how America reacts to these kinds of "minor" intrusions, and America reacted fittingly.
It’s clearly aliens.
This will be a big nothing burger.
A car size flying object shoot down with a missile landed on ice
Flying Egg Roll 👽
you started the war with them. -aliens
I thought it was a balloon. Doesn't that explain how it stays in the air?
what is this battlestar galaxtica?
Conflicting accounts. How interesting. This is setting up to be a massive cover up of a UFO but whatever. I don't know if I care anymore.
I listen to CNN and FOX in order to know what kinda BS they want us to think.
_Lights come and go in the night sky. Men, troubled at last by the things they build, may toss in their sleep and dream bad dreams, or lie awake while the meteors whisper greenly overhead. But nowhere in all space or on a thousand worlds will there be men to share our loneliness._ Loren Eiseley _The Immense Journey_ 1957
How about a hypersonic  ramjet plane mach8
These  are Chinese decoy to fool us about the 1st one we shot down.
what if those object were full of viruses and we shoot them down ??
hopefully the people searching and recovering the debris don't get sick from whatever it is that they find.
How to say UFO without saying UFO, this is our Roswell
Aliens.  No doubt aliens.  Space aliens.  Real live Roswell shit here.
Allright boys gear up we are going to fight with aliens.
It's the same thing with air balloons. You fill the balloon with x amount of hydrogen that goes up so far, and follow the jet stream.
Sounds like a UAP
Maybe the aliens are invaiding us, they'll provably organize the worl better than us !!! lol
Good job they shot it down over frozen water and not melted ice 🤣
It will be awkward if USA versus china turned into a intergalactic war…
In light of what has happened over the last few days starting the this Chinese balloon has the US government finally had enough of these UAP’s invading there airspace and started shooting them all down? If so things could get interesting very quickly!?
Under Trump, 4 flyovers, 0 shootdowns.  Under Biden, 3 flyovers, 3 shootdowns.  Thank God China Don is out of the Whitehouse.
You can imagine the number and types of aircraft identification photos that a pilot is shown during training and then tested to identify as they are being trained, so when they say that they can't identify something, it really stands out as weird!
Aliens?????
Have they accidentally shot down a ufo?  That would be human against alien from out of space conflict!
This decade has a lot of surprises.
ET Is coming back and he is pissed!
RIP 🎅 Santa
I saw this movie and the aliens win 🤷‍♂️👽
Oh oh, get ready for UFO retaliation!!  Let’s offer Trump as the sacrificial lamb!!
F22 has only one seat so there were at least three missions flown to ID the thing.  No one saw any balloon
When we see the debris it will be the jessie Marcel pics in roswell all over again!
Fake News,  we will never forget
Aliens probing the earth for a space ship
It’s an Imperial Probe Droid  .
Project Blue Beam is in full effect. Beware of false prophets.
Bout time they're gonna announce contact to safe us from destroying ourselves
where's the footage from the fighter planes that shot them down?
Maverick: “Dude it was sick, me and Iceman blew this big white thing outta the sky. I mean, it said Goodyear on it but could be a disguise!”
This is exciting
Are space ships landed in alaska
We need a complete leap frog in sensor technology.
This is all a bunch of nonsense. President Biden let's get amnesty and citizenship passed for our migrant and immigrant friends. Mr President you campaigned on citizenship and amnesty. Get this passed now.
Have the Fallen Angels got lost while flying around in their Chariots again?
july 7. 1947
When will they release the camera footage?f 35s have several high resolution cameras on them.
CCP dictatorship in China is quadrupling its nuclear arsenal.
If they thought it was extra terrestrial they would not announce it on the news. This is early days in justification for the ramp up to war.
Do aliens still do the anal probe procedure?
So china linked up with aliens
I’ve been in the cockpit (as an observer) when a jet pass us head on. It was so fast. It seem so close but it really wasn’t. I can see why pilots can’t exactly describe what they see
How and why are we so sure these are Chinese? Seems to me, It's far more likely to be Russians.And the republican's defense of Russia and their ginning up of a war against China is too obvious to me.
In a nutshell, it's an UFO.
If Aliens ever want to came to us in peace or to warn us we would shut them down first than ask questions later...
I'm sorry but this, "pilots going that fast no wonder they don't know". Yet, your pilots know how to identify different objects like between a mig 29 and su-27, typhoon and a f-18, etc etc.  Your making your pilots sound like idiots when you say this sh*t.
Speed of flight, manoeuvrability, tell us the basics!
It is not extraterrestrial...
It came from Africa 😅
The speed has nothing to do with instruments of the plane not working
Let me guess we won't get a picture of this one.
Please let it be aliens
The Reich-Wing Maga 🤡 show.
I wish it was people from outer space but I guarantee it's from Russia and China
Just like CNN. They haven't done REAL news in so long they forget to ask and find out IMPORTANT Information.
It’s either China, Russian or North Korea trying to spy on us
Let's get the facts.  This young woman is speculating.  Foolish and dangerous.
Enough with the Alien comments. Jokes been done 1000 times since yesterday afternoon. Unoriginal and annoying.
The Biden administration and our military have had this Chinese balloon situation under control from the beginning.
FAKE NEWS CNN
Well, the aliens 👽 picked the wrong week to visit the US. We don't mind the ET visiting, but damn if we late the Chinese trespass our airspace 😡
Me to my kids:  Okay kids pack it up. We are moving to the mountains to live like cave men.
I got pregnant when the balloon flew over my town
Sounds like someone is trying to get us ready for Alien disclosure. (One can only hope!) 👽👽👽🥳
If you don´t know what it is then don´t speculate.....this is so stupid an attitude.
They got the debris  but they cant tell what it is????
High altitude, intelligence gathering drone.
THE POWERS THAT BE WILL NEVER TELL US THE TRUTH...... WE ALL SHOULD KNOW THAT BY NOW.
Stop Trying to miss direct with all the China crap !
Whatever it is the government will lie about it that's what they do
This is stupid always a scam to scare the American people on some stupid bull crap 💩. Everyone in that White House mess up the economy for American. Man just some bull crap
No obvious means of propulsion.... No obvious way of staying airborne..... It was a Balloon ..... Do a Google research on Balloons... Very enlightening....   God Help Us...
It's aliens  👽🤖👾👽👾🤖👾👽👽
ALIENS
Tic tac
Was revealed to be a Mexican spy balloon by the massive candy explosion.
Everyone is so afraid to say UFO… they say Unidentified object… Unidentified aerial phenomena… Just say UFO lol
Natasha is a CIA agent. She's knows but is not allowed to tell. ALIENS!!! lol
Interesting stuff 🤔.
Finally, aliens are probing how we would welcome them on planet earth.
Loitering munitions type drone.
ALASKA, JUST AS MOUNT SHASTA ARE LAUNCHING PADS FOR ALIENS 👽 💖 DID ONE THINK THAT WE HUMANS, WERE THE ONLY ONES’ ON THIS PLANET 🌎 CALLED EARTH 🌍  THEY’RE HERE TO PREVENT WWIII 😳👍🏽🙏🏽 SOMEONE HAS TO INTERVENE N PREVENT A CATASTROPHE 😢😲💔💓
Thank you Jim Jordan,another Republican keeping his promises.
Bill Pullman 2024!
Fbi? More like Men In Black!
Someone is lying, chuck Schumer said evey object was a Balloon but the pilots describe something a little different that seems to show more intelligence then just a balloon
Hope it wasn't lawnchair larry again 😂
It's a Unidentified Flying  Object UFO still...
They got money for wars but can't make a better fry chicken. 🤣😂
watch for the cia ufo info rollout soon folks! weve been waiting for some event like this for them to start it.... edit: they said specifically it was not a balloon. he said "these balloons". using a balloon as cover lol.
UFO?  Aliens are now more brazen?  Cylindrical object with no identifiable propulsion 🤨🤔
The flight speed of the object would be useful in understanding the situation.
With Jim Acosta behind it the tittle should be “listen what the pilots did NOT say about the flying object” 😂
Biden going shoot down civilian airliners now?
Thank you Russia 🇷🇺
What’s happening
Russia and china are laughing now, well done genius Brandon
Natasha could get it 😘
Uh Oh.   Don't  fuck with the aliens!
Dang, we just shot ET.
They’re here!!
Not suspicious whatsoever.
BALLOON 2024 !
🇺🇸Where was the defences during 9:I I ? 🤔
LET BALLOON IN PEACE !
