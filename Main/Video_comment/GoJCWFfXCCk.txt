THEY CHEATED
ESPN. If you’re a sports fan stop watching ESPN
Cheater Jimmy just burned the program to the ground lmfao
They took over from the start of the game 😢..go Michigan..😂
Great year 😅😅
3 to 4 top coach on the planet thats high praises i love it Joel knows his stuff no question about who you look to if you want the real raw unbiased truth on football its Klatt
Michigan is a true championship team!
Another UM coach leaves with a losing record against their rival😂😂😂
Oh god. Love Colin but don’t ever suggest a shorter baseball season that’s so dumb
Colin, Lamar Jackson has the same number of playoff wins as Baker Mayfield.
He’ll never be Schembechler. Because he quit and left for the rigged, NFL. If Bo had won a national championship, he would have stayed and led them to more national championships. Realizing the dream of holding the Lombardi trophy is one thing. Leading a historical school to multiple national championships, like Nick Saban, is another.
Cheatigan are cheaters who cheat.
Now I understand why Brian Flores wanted Jordan Love over Justin Herbert.
Stay at Michigan Jim lol. The Chargers job isn’t what Colin makes it out to be.
As a chargers fan WE CANT WAIT FOR JIM 🥹
One of the best ever with one championship? So Jimbo Fisher and Jim Tresses are up their too now?
Jim Harbaugh should stay put in COLLEGE football. He was no match for brother John in the NFL.
Hail to the Victors! 〽️ *15-0 | Go Blue* 🏆
Colt carried those teams
When it comes to anything college football related NO ONE can fck with Joel Klatt. At least 24 hours before Alabama made their hire, Klatt said clearly in an interview with Colin that he'd be surprised if DeBoner was not Alabama new coach. I'm hoping he continues to evolve into NFL booth.
Come on, Joel. They cannot have the playoffs in December. The players have something called finals in their classes. Let's not forget that they are also supposed to be students. First time you said something that has me shaking my head.
Let's be real Colin. Pete Carroll left college football because the NCAA (yes, a pathetic organization) finally caught up with him and the money that flowed through USC at the time. As for McCarthy, he will get bigger and, I believe, has the IT factor that will make him a successful NFL quarterback. He'd look great in a Giants uniform.
Michigan*
Cemented as a cheater
Klatt should be the President of the NCAA...
Belichick to Michigan would be hilarious...
Roflmao legacy as a cheater who will see that title revoked within a decade 🙄
I would imagine he’d pick a team in the NFC because his brother coaches the Ravens and he’s already faced him in a Super Bowl
Jim harbaugh is not going to the nfl he wants to defends what’s his and Harbaugh has never been the type of coach to want to go to a perfect situation he likes control and he likes going to dysfunctional organizations and turning them around I think he stays 1 more year and then goes to Chicago next year because let’s face it bears have to make playoffs next year or eberflus is gone and that ain’t happening
Imagine favoring racist James of course they favor him,biggest race baiter in the country
My favorite Herd segment.
Hope he goes to Chargers
Joe Klatt be speaking that real
Harbaugh wants to stay in Ann Arbor.
Colin cowherd calling out Matt Ryan for not being good when facing pressure. Did he not watch Matt Ryan’s games? He rarely had a good offensive line and was a borderline hall of famer
The Lions drafted Calvin Johnson..GT didn't and doesnt throw. Just because they aren't asked to do certain things, doesn't make them incapable js
Klatt is hilarious i think he should be on during the nfl season to he makes good nfl takes as well
As a casual ill only remember him for cheating
Ryan day is not good enough to coach at ohio state. And its obvious. But who are they gonna go get?
It's unreal that people still cheer on a team that cheated...yall need to look in the mirror or go back to school or listen to your mom or something, ppl are crazy and selling there souls for anything. Smh ignorance is bliss
Only legacy will be cheating and taking away the trophy. Cant wait.
Did they cheat? 😂😂😂😂 Dude knew his job was on the line so they had to cheat to win 😂😂😂😂😂😂rigged
One championship and he has a legacy 😂😂😂😂😂😂 stop it people
The Ohio State fans cry Vrabel because they don't see a mean team on the field.  That has always been OSU's mantra.  Hopefully Day and the Buckeyes get the little things ironed out.
The NCAA rules are so absurd.  Why would Harbaugh want to deal with this nonsense
breaking, google it "NCAA president says Michigan earned football national title 'fair and square'"
The absolute power that the corrupt NCAA has always had is fading, they are up against the ropes and they are throwing haymakers.
Bo never won a national championship even though he’s one of the best coaches in Michigan history
As a cheater, yes his legacy is cemented
Michigan proved, cheat cheat cheat, you can’t be beat beat beat.
*Harbaugh to bama*
As a Michigan fan, i hope Day stays at OH as it is a great rivalry and he is a great coach of our biggest rival.
Love Klatt
No one going to talk about Colin saying college football is like his family 😂
💙💛💙💛
This is why I love this show...
Did Colin seriously just advocate baseball start their PLAYOFFS in the beginning of AUGUST?????  GTFOH, Cowturd: just because you're manically-obsessed with RATINGS, doesn't mean the rest of us have lost our true love for sport (not to mention the NATIONAL PASTIME).  October baseball is the best.
Still probably gonna be a good year for the Lamar "haters," Colin. Once the calendar changes to January, we all know what happens to Lamar...🎃. 😅
Klatt's point about Michigan winning despite not having top 3 recruiting/roster to me doesn't prove anything changed.  Michigan obviously did a tremendous job developing the players' abilities to a very high level, and as he said they were a veteran (well-developed) group.  If you can keep guys around and get to where you have a deep roster of very well developed 3 & 4 star guys...and the other team has a little higher talent but not as veteran, not as developed...you have a great chance.  But all the player movement as well as the going pro early aspect makes that pretty hard to do, maybe extremely hard, so pretty unlikely.  Is that trend going back the other way?  Not that I can see.  Seems to me more likely that Michigan's model will prove to be the exception.
McCarthy of UM is the best and most complete QB in college football. Cerebral and a great leader. 27-1 as a starting QB for cripe's sake. Case closed.
Legendary. The brilliant Harbaugh is the greatest coach, pro or college, in the game today. Case closed.
Great interview gents, great season. Already can’t wait for the fall
He’s a cheat.
I wish there were more honest conversations like this. Love klatt love herd. Go blue.
Go Blue 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
Sec. Got punched in the face 😂
Jim Harbaugh was never a good enough coach to lead a team to a championship of any kind. He struggled to do so in the NFL, he struggled to do so at Michigan. Then he learned how to cheat and that's now THAT is his legacy.
Can’t wait to see Collin cream his pants for Jim
The National Championship Game should be the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1st. every year.
Why would he want to go to the commanders
Top report by the man. Jodie has fallen in love w the 12s. They are like her kids & momma wants to make a v v happy home at lumen.  PC will be a great vice prez special advisor or similar. He will build a dynasty as the moral boss of the seahawks, winning more rings than the patriots. Jodie Allen will choose a new HC by end of wednesday 10.01.24 as she does not mess about, it cud be the return of the mighty Quinn to his hometown w co-homeboy Doug Petersen as a HC/OC/DC duo.   Or Jim Harbaugh who is v respected in the NFC West & HAS UNFINISHED BUSINESS WITH THE 49's after being harshly sacked & also w the Ravens after the SB lights went off.   I hope NFL fans & 12s will be grateful as he is still seahawks only SB winning HC & a lovely man. Even 49er fans love him.   The man who changed the NFL by creating the legendry LoB,  & the HC most admired by SB winners Belichick & Gruden & Tomlin & Parcells etc
Commanders vs Ravens Superbowl 🧐
Best college football analysis anywhere. Hands down. No audacious stupid comments just to generate fake CONFLICT or controversy. Just an expert look at all aspects college football. THANK YOU!
I looked at it a bit differently. Does he want to stay in his house, not uproot his family, make NFL money, and be a living legend for life in AA  OR  Take a job with a fickle NFL team where he’s more likely to be gone in five years than not?  I hope Jim sees it my way oki
Vrabel....hilarious no way as a Buckeye do we give up Day for him....by the way fix the damn portal until after the bowl games and ncaa management sucks not even business savvy  at this point...and to cowheard...Cheating is still cheating
Hail yes! And total props to Penix, played hurt, heart of a lion!
Herbert sucks and Harbaugh is not going to the chargers. Stop voicing your biased opinion on the chargers... we don't want to hear it over and over.
Cemented as a constant Cheater!
Michigan will have more draft picks from this years team than anyone else.   Klatt is a 🤡
*
ASTRIK
cemented as a cheater?
Jimmy will forever be known as a cheater.
The last 5 mins was 😂😂😂  God I live college football.   I hope they make the national championship game the rose bowl on New Year’s Day!! Would be epic. Own it!
If harbaugh leaves, would love to see him with the chargers and Sherron Moore and Mintor to stay at Michigan. Michigan would be set for 10 years if they stuck around!!
I absolutely love these 2 together!
Penix in the big game channeled his time at Indiana who got beaten time after time by Michigan. Tom Bush
Colin is pulling it out of his a$$ again. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is it Jim or should his brother get the credit?  Jim was about to be let go and his brother sent two defensive coaches to Michigan. Not saying Jim’s a bad coach however would he have won the natty if his brother had not helped him?
Ryan Day is marginal. Ohio states as their mission statement to beat Michigan every year and he’s lost the last three years. He’s gotta go.
Every B1G coach knew but Harbaugh lmao  I love that Cowturd brings up Pete Carroll. Another cheater that got away with it. These have to be the two most annoying people in media.
Joel klatt .. you are great for college football.. finally giving Michigan all kinds of credit..
Come to the titans please Harbaugh
Biggest scam of 2023-2024(so far)
The whole point of cheating is to benefit the team. So to argue you can't punish the team when someone cheats is ridiculous.  Just eleminate the rules if you don't ever actually intend to enforce them.
Congratulations for champion
The old miss rb that is going to slohio is because, like the suc conference, is being handed a bag of cash period! And maybe a Lamborghini as well😂😂😂😂😂Gooooo Bluuuuuueeeeee Baby!
What a great year of Joel and Colin; best segment on the show
JJ can and would do much more if they needed him to, period!
One of the best shows.  So many good points.
So you expect me to believe Harbaugh, a QB all-american alumni who spent 9 years building the Michigan Football program from bowless to National champs, is going to leave for the NFL? For what, money? He just cemented a job as the head coach until he retires. He can do wht he wants at Michigan with no owner breathing down his neck, no primadonna players. His legacy is just beginning. It would be the dumbest mistake to leave. You dont level up to quit.
Excellent analysis from two professionals. What a difference from the reasoning of the haters and bozos online.  Side point though: Joel keeps saying Michigan only had two 5* players. I count three: JJ, Will, and Donovan. Am I missing something?
If College Football finally gets a commissioner I nominate Joel Klatt. He's the only man for the Job
Go Big Red!!
Klatt is the best!
Yes, his reputation is sealed as a cheater, liar, and non-compliant stonewaller of the NCAA.  He is no hero.
I don’t go with any thing Klatt says about Michigan, because I don’t think he can be objective. He is extremely biased when it comes to harbaugh and Michigan.
Congrats, Michigan*! *program under current NCAA investigation for cheating
Nat'l Championship*  *The Astros, Black Sox, and Patriots have been waiting for you.
I really wanted to comment on the portion of the show you spent protecting Shawn Payton. However, you’re not putting that one in your YouTube space. I understand why you are so into protecting Sean Payton that you don’t want other people calling you out but it’s getting a little bit ridiculous
Joel…your wife should keep an eye on you and Harbaugh.
Jim DESERVES NOTHING!!!
Sherrone Moore is Harbaugh’s David Shaw
Now one thing I'd say Harbaugh and Michigan have going for them from a portal perspective (which would be a reason for Harbaugh to stay) is recently Michigan has seen a huge net positive in terms of transfers in as opposed to transfers out. And those players who are transferring out are fringe guys who risk disrupting the positive unselfish culture if they stay because they're clearly not willing to fight for playing time. And Michigan just became that much more popular having won the Natty. Their schedule is brutal next year but with the expanding playoff I can see Michigan repeating as National Champs (which will be very tough) even if they have a disappointing 10-2 / 9-3 Regular season because you know one or two 9-3 teams will get into the playoff and the committee won't leave the defending champs out if they're record is at least 9-3.
Great year guys. Loved watching you two. GoBlue!!
Drake is a bust
I'd be shocked if harbaugh is on the Michigan sideline next year, makes no sense, he has nothing left to prove on the college level
Penix had THREE top receivers. Stroud had THREE NFL receivers. JJ McCarthy DOES NOT!! HUGE DIFFERENCE!!
John Beilien, definitely the best developer of 3 and 4 star talent in basketball left for a horrible NBA job because of the one-and-dones. College sports is a mess.
How was this game close if Washington lost by 3 scores?
Ohio State is soft
Just wasn’t a good year in College Football….. it was a GREAT year. Thank you Colin & Joel for being so much fun to listen to. You guys are a major highlight of my week and I always look forward to your weekly segment.
Please come to the chargers harbaugh we need you
Probably the best take I've ever heard on the ineptitude of the NCAA at the end there.
Fixed games in the playoff* got him the natty*
Cemented as a cheater
Jim brought out the slimy win at all cost side in the UM community. Hope your permanently trashed reputation was worth it. And he still hasnt beaten OSU straight up on the sidelines without cheating. Sherrone won that last one.
And what a legacy it is - up there w brady and billicheat as the biggest cheaters in historu
These two have the best takes in the industry
Im a buckeye fan but its crqxy when ohio state was on their 7 ir 8 year run and harbaugh hadnt beat us yet and most of the ttun fan base was giving up on him. And now where he is is amazing. Shiut out to yall for what you did this yeqr
The University should eventually see fit to put a new statue outside of Schembechler Hall. It should depict Bo coaching Jim; no-brainer; even a Sparty grad would agree.
they cheated and klatt wants to blame the ncaa. how rich. i'm out
This Win has it's roots in "The Team" speech from Bo Schembechler when Jim Harbaugh was a player! (this is the best version on YT:  7KOwLaCf0y0) Michigan Football is once again all about "The Team, The Team, The Team"  Hail to the Victors! Valiant! Hail to the Conquering Heroes! Hail! Hail to Michigan! The Leaders and Best! GO BLUE!
finally,klatt gets his win, course they cheated to do it but hey who don't.right?
Go blue national champions
The Michigan defense did to Penix what the Ravens D. Did to Tua, Purdy, Goff and others because the Michigan D. Was designed by Mike McDonald from the Ravens. That’s my opinion.
What about the Bears if that job comes available? Or The Falcons?
He had to cheat to finally get there! What are we talking about here?
If there was a 12 team playoff this year this would not have been the outcome. What really blows my mind is these media heads still defend that Harbaugh didn't know what was going on. But carry on.
Y'all are crazy if you think another team will ever win a natty with just 2 5 star athletes. After the 2024 season there will not be any more super seniors in college football
I'm at 12:10 of this video writing this....  Neither Joel nor Colin has uttered a word I disagree with....  But keeping what Harbaugh has built at Michigan also gets a bit "unraveled" if Jim leaves and takes key components like Jesse Minter with him. I hope Jim has an exit strategy that includes restocking the shelves with people he knows share the current football philosophy and culture at Michigan.   I don't mean that Jim is making those choices, but that he might have replacements in mind that he would recommend.  Later....  Both of these guys seemed to forget that it's "college" football. These players are also students. That's why games take a month off after the regular season.
He won 1 championship and now he a top 5 coach FOH he's a good coach but  top 5 NAWL
Harbaugh better than Saban 15-17 Saban. Harbaugh turned Stanford around. Saban couldn't beat Michigan while being a Sparty. If Saban can't out 5 star you he can't beat you.
ole miss recruit shows up in a Lambo to sign....they bust Harbaugh on cheeseburgers
Every single time Penix's team falls behind he's "hurt". Go back and look at the Indiana games.
*Michigan National Champs Cheater, There will be a stain forever on Michigan. Once the NCAA finishes it investigation the National Champs will be Washington.
Penix exposed as a 6th round QB
The Jim Harbaugh PR Firm headed by Colin Cowherd
Deep down Joel wants to say the truth but he cant becouse he has to maintain healthy relationships with these coachs. He knows Harbaugh is a fraud and a cheat. He ran a dirty program with recruiting violations far worse then anything about fckin cheeseburger. And the largest on Field cheating schemes ever Michigan winning the natty is criminal.
Let's goo harbaugh ❤️😊🙏
Best content is sports talk. By far. Easily.
Yeah I have basic cable and stream. Couldn't even watch the game cause it was on ESPN. Klatt makes a good point. Want it to be popular, play it where people can watch like the NFL.
Joel Klatt needs to run the NCAAF
Jim Harbaugh may come off as a little quirky, but we love him at Michigan. I’m praying that he and JJ stay for another year about standing Michigan football.
I want what y'all smoking 😂
There are rumors that Nick Siriani could be fired if the Eagles don’t play well against the Bucs. If that job becomes available, everything Colin said about Washington would be true about Philadelphia except they have a much better roster.   Harbird brothers
Go blue
You forgot about Michigan cheating to win.
And the Bible foretold, the Great Satan would rise from the north.
Burp
how will Klatt and Colin handle it when there are 3 to 4 SEC teams in the playoffs next year!
Schembechler? This guy lost almost all of his bowls and years of losses to Ohio State, and is under a cloud of cheating. Klatt picked Bama over Mich. Now, Harbaugh is great?
Damn imma miss listening to these two. Can’t wait for another season
I LOVED IT!!! Congratulations to The Michigan Blue, The Wolverines!!! I am so happy, so happy this Big Ten Michigan team won, in effect also dropping a huge load of stool on ESPN and the NCAA and their arrogant and ignorant biases.      THIS would happen more (northern teams winning) and more if every major bowl was held in absolute NEUTRAL regions or zones. The Big Ten, and other northern states teams, would win more bowls if the NCAA weren't so 'traditional' (bias and arrogant) having southern teams nearly always playing in state or a neighboring state. It would likely take a couple of years to get use to the proper change, but win more bowls northern state teams would do. This is still college sports, and until the players leave college, they are students and need to be taught about Fairness, Justice and Equality: bowls NEED to be played in obviously Neutral grounds. Due to the NCAA's "tradition," we have mostly southern states winning the major bowls. Most people disagree, but their comments are typically brainless. Any of you who agree, YOU have the ability to Tweet, Facebook, Instagram, Etc., at the NCAA, and if you are college students you can access more to contact your school's dean, coach, and president and insist to of them to reach out to the NCAA and demand change for a better balance in the way bowls are held.
No Sherrone Moore!!!!!
Michael pennix didn’t look good. He couldn’t handle the pressure and had a bunch of injuries. His draft stock had to have dropped. Jj seemed game manager to me
Harbaugh aint going anywhere unless he has final say on personnel. Patriots and #3 pick are calling. Watch.
I have to say I think McCarthy is much better than he gets credit for he had some big scrambles in key moments last night and he fits the ball in tight windows he was also great in the Ohio State and Alabama games I think he would need some time but could easily be an NFL guy with a year or two
How come the sportscasters never deal with the true elephant in the room... About this being a silly witch hunt .. because Coach harbaugh has totally backed the NIL... Now the NCAA, its owned conference,coaches,and universities, want him eliminated because of this
These 2 guys here they love the fact that the SEC didn't win it this year🤣🤣🤣
Love klatt but cowherds a phony
Klatt for CFB CEO no 🧢
Colin has to bring him back and do the draft game he always does.
Great points
Go Blue!!!
Colin should bring klatt on the volume and do a podcast with him weekly.
I hope Jim Harbaugh stays, but NCAA is killing their own sport like when they came after Pete Carroll
WOW! 5 years of 0 meaningful wins with top 5 recruiting classes every year, then he needs to start cheating for 2.5 years and passing the play calling off to talented coaches to finally go anywhere. Then he catches a break with Georgia being severely injured and knocked out by a rebuilding Bama who has a QB incapable of throwing anything but a deep ball. And now, for watching his players and assistant coaches carry him to a championship as all the "top programs" play first year QBs, you want to put Harbaugh in the conversation for one of the best coaches ever?!?!? I am saddened at how little research your show does because Harbaugh and Michigan didn't start winning meaningful games until John Harbaugh started sending his NFL coordinators to Ann Arbor to bail his wacky brother out. Joel Klatt, even the Kremlin is alarmed with how much false propaganda you spew, but at least you get to bring home that large check sporting the old block M
Jim Harbaugh is the Napoleon of football: relentless towards perfection, constantly looking for the next challenge. Sky is the limit for him
Joel Klatt is so good
Nooooooooooo Sheronne Moore has not called a good game. The players won those games. The job is too big too spotlighted. Recruits will not come for Sherrone. The Washington coach is the best option with a pro offense. That will lure high caliber kids
Klatt is the best...are we really not gonna see him on Cowherd until next college football season? 😞
McCarthy needs to go back to school
Joel: “The National championship game should give several programs hope”  Me (a vanderbilt fan) so you’re saying there’s a chance👀
Y’all called for his job 3 years ago…..
Great show guys!!
Great stuff!!
I disagree with klatt on the osu thing why does he keep defending day nothing is going to change with day
Just think JJ was his 1st real QB since he's been at Michigan 〽️
Penix’s draft stock went down.
He didn't win on both level. Only college. Say it right plz
Worse case scenario Michigan will probably hire him as a QB coach
Colin's memory is failing him.  When he was there, Texas' entire offense ran through Colt McCoy.  Colt McCoy was asked to do what Penix was asked to do...carry his team.  Quick intermediate passes interspersed with the killer deep route.  Penix is basically a left handed version of McCoy - he is a little slower than McCoy but has a better arm.
Cable lol
Michael Penix is 3 years older than JJ with more college experience.  I’d like to see JJ stay at Michigan another year and see before saying he’s not NFL caliber.
If I see one more shriners hospital commercial I'm going to lose my sh*t
The reason Michigan sucked in the 2nd and 3rd quarter. Is that Moore didn't adjust his play calling to what Washington was doing. The offensive play calling was horrible. They won in spite of that. I think it was bad in the Rose Bowl as well.
I keep hearing 2 5 star players. Wasn’t Donovan Edwards a 5 ⭐️?
Joel klatt and colin are both G’s these allegations against Michigan are such bs they was want haurbaugh out but i think he will stay
So many grown men crying in the comment section 😅! So many Michigan haters!!!
Why does Colin and these pundits talk like Spanos would spend any kind of money for a coach?  SPANOS IS NOTORIOUSLY CHEAP!!!  That's one of the reasons the Chargers are in LA.
CHEATERS
Joel Klatt is always good. always
TN Titans should hire him
This will always have an asterisk by it. Cheaters!
He painted a target on his back when he started talking about the players getting paid….that is not in the best interest of the NCAA (even though the NCAA should have the best interest of the players in mind)
It’s funny to see Michigan fans celebrating and loving harbaugh today, as 2-3 years ago they were calling for his head because he wasn’t beating OSU and in the mix for a national championship, all the while winning 9-10 games a year.  I have many family members that are delusional Michigan fans in that way.  They act as if Michigan has been regularly winning national championships over the last 50+ years, when that is objectively false.  They’re a great program but haven’t been as good as they think they are over the last half century.  Harbaugh has always been the best thing that has happened to them since they shared the national championship in the 1997 season or so.  He is a great coach and proves it last night.  Those who called for his head can’t now claim to love the man because he finally won the championship when he has always proven to be a winning coach his entire career. He needs to go back to the nfl to get away from the ncaa and unrealistic expectations from Michigan fans.
Cemented as a cheater. 😅
If Jim doesn’t understand why there was even an investigation, why did he accept the three game suspension?
So good. These guys deliver.
Pete Carroll left because sanctions were coming the next year...Colin is such a sucka**
Colin is always wrong. Own up to your non sense sir. That is it I’m just here to post that you as a journalist suck.
Your commentary on the NCAA "allegations" was spot on.  I really hope Harbaugh stays, but I understand if he goes.
Go Blue!
Klatt Masterclass
Hey Colin just so you know nobody cares how close their family is. You've mentioned it twice now and nobody cares. I'm sure you'll mention it a third time but again nobody cares. 🤔🧐
When you explained McCarthy you were expecting Brady
I'm a Michigan fan, but DAMN that Penix is one tough sonofabitch!
Love Klatt's passion for college football!
Sorry mess up on typing Ron Ron Va
Michigan won by cheating with a cheating coach.  Jim Harbaugh has neither ethics or morals.
I’m convinced Alabama over Georgia for playoff spot was controversial because it wasn’t supposed to be. Hearing Colin open up just makes it sound like a business move to let a suss Alabama in versus a Georgia that probably would’ve beat the spread after a late season loss.
It's over? I bet the SEC wins next year
Love it I all ways believe in his coaching old school mix with new school.He always keep a deep team big lineman offence and defense . Physical running backs mix speed running backs.Good special teams. Great defense backs physical make big time interception interceptions.He the same thing in San Francisco😂 Both Brothers are great coaches, linebackers awesome cover good and very physical. Ron Ron Va.
One title and his legacy is complete? Hilarious. It’s funny to see these guys cover for Harbaugh as he runs from the NCAA.
Mirrors 2014 playoffs. Quite fitting end to this era.
Build the statue NOW! GO BLUEEEEEEEEEEEE
Calling out cheating is not hating.
These two are online gold. Go Blue〽️🏆
Joel Klatt is to college football as Jay Bilas is to college basketball. Such great insight and strategy to make the sport better.
See ya next year klatt! Expanded playoff should be hectic lol
Rules violations and hires a guy to cheat, losing record to OSU, 2-7 post season going to this season,recently coached a losing season, out side of top 10 on recruiting,only wins about 75%of games. Yeah some legacy.
Matt Leinart won a Heisman Colin...... Don't imply he didn't have to do much 😂😂😂
you guys are the reason college football is starting to enter its golden age. Thank you joel and colin
Colin is going to miss his daddy for the next 9 months. So nice that Klatt made time for his son one last time this season.
I had a co-worker explain Penix's struggles against Michigan in a way that actually kinda made sense to me.  He said Michigan's defense was the closest thing Penix had ever seen to a pro-level NFL defense, and he played a lot like an NFL rookie QB.
Winning 2 or 3 is actually a legacy. One is great, but trying for a mini dynasty is what we remember for more than 5 years.
Washington doesn’t want Harbaugh. They want a younger coach.
6:25 "NFL ... has a free agent period" but you can be asking for interviews with coaches whose teams are in the playoffs.  For fairness across the field (pun not intended) have a rule: you cannot contact a coach on a current playoff team until the SB is over (note: it's not "when their run" is over, becaise that would still lead to an unfair field)
Harbough went 6-6 3 years in a row and was on the verge of getting fired and he’s the best coach ever. Aight then lol
Anyone not a Michigan fan doesn’t recognize this title. They cheated, everyone knows it.
I would pick Penix over McCarthy any day of the week!!
So basically Klatt is just happy if the sec does not win. Hater 🤦🏽‍♂️
With the exception of Andrew Luck, Jim has always had game manager QBs
Cemented in CHEATING! You morons supporting this BS is disgusting!!! They cheated got caught found guilty and you act like it just fine,,,,, wake up
Michigan has alot of money and will fight for Harbaugh! Harbaugh would get whatever he wants at Michigan if he stays!
A lot of Buckeye fans in the comments today.  I do love the taste of all of these Buckeye tears.
Michigan winning The Rose Bowl on New Year's Day was just right. It was perfect for a program overflowing with tradition to win "the granddaddy of them all" on New Year's Day. I felt like I was a kid again!
Joel Klatt has turned into the voice of college football.
Klatt should be running college football.
If Jim leaves this year they have to give the reigns to Minter. They can't replace him.
We do know that Harbaugh is staying. I don't know why they keep bringing it up, just for clicks I guess. Harbaugh met with the Michigan Board of Regents before heading out to the Rose Bowl and everyone who was at the meeting said he's coming back.
Wolverines #1🔥
How f*cking naive can Joel Klatt be? Harbaugh is genuine because he offered his phone and computer?
My two favorite guys
Jessie not leaving and if Harbs goes not taking assists with him!!
Alabama v Michigan was the national championship this year
Penix didn't play well DUE to M's D!!!!!
Fire Ryan Day
The game is won and lost at the LOS. It's not as hard to find the skill guys, they are plentiful. It's so much harder to identify and then develop the OL/DL. They are much fewer in number. There's a reason why USC isn't winning like it used to under Pete Carroll and why Alabama and Georgia have owned the sport the last few years. Michigan's playoff run this year was defined by the play at the LOS.
Bo had winning rec v sleeznuts and dom Moo U. Both stunk in bowl games!
The only thing Jim cemented is that he is a cheater.
Cheating pays
All those NFL jobs is trash compared to 〽️ where he has complete control Harbaugh will not win in SB in any of these situations in NFL he’s still young I don’t see the rush.. I’ll be trying win back to back
Klatt still has OSu #1
I want Jesse minter as HC over Moore. I think…. But maybe minter is destined for nfl as klatt put it
Bowl games should be given opportunity to be campus home games. Not at these stupid NFL stadiums.
I have become a huge fan of Joel Klatt.   He is so good  for college football.
These guys were more fun when they were throwing food at each other.
The Michigan fan base should have pushed back harder on the university administrators who haven’t had their coaches back towards the NCAA, Harbaugh endorsed player compensation for bowl games and received a suspension for the words he used to say it. The sign stealing controversy was treated like the NCAA doesn’t know it happens all the time, a ridiculous assertion that Harbaugh had to suffer another suspension for. It appeared to me that Michigan administrators agreed, and even pushed for disciplinary action against Harbaugh over nonsense. If Harbaugh does leave Michigan, there’s a lot of blame to be laid at the feet of the administration.
Michigan dominated the entire D game-tried to give it away for 3 quarters but W said Nah! If these r two best team for colleague-what an underwhelming game. No wonder so many busted drafts!
It's a bit scary how much JJ McCarthy compares to Jim Harbaugh as a prospect.
What really is Harbaugh’s “legacy” there?  Man won a title.  Man got suspended twice in his natty season.
Idiots
I guarantee you, Jim does not go to the Chargers or Washington! I bet you he goes to the Raiders and I bet it’s because they’re going to offer more money than anyone else!
College games are no where near nfl. Harbaw learned this as a mediocre qb
GO MF BLUE 〽️〽️😏
Id take any sort of podcast with you two together. Even if it was only once a month or only during the college football season we need an hour of you two just talking about all things college football and above if willing to.
Penix played 6 seasons of college football- McCarthy has played 3.
The funniest part about the "recruiting violations" is Covid also change the no contact schedule for recruits. So the kid probably get mixed up, Michigan feeds him, Jim Harbaugh doesnt lie but says he doesnt remember and the NCAA has a receipt and says he lies and upgrades it to a level 1 violation.
Am I the only one who sees Penix throwing motion looking off? He seems to swing his throwing arm when trying to throw 15+ yards. Doesn’t look big and strong like a Maye/Williams
Klatt is a good analyst - I just don’t see the upside with Penix. This game showed that VS NFL teams he is much closer to Tua than anyone else and Tua was a better prospect. Trading up to take him would be a mistake. As a Giants fan, I want Maye
Another great show, but sad to think that we have to wait until next season to see these two again!
His legacy is he is a CHEATER!
From DeflateGate to the two NCAA violations this year I'm so unimpressed with how both the NFL and NCAA deal with "scandals".  The media hypes the controversy and the executives have no backbone - they are simply politicians and just want to appear "tough", regardless of justice or truth.  It's only about the money and their jobs.  Harbaugh is a lover of football, as was Brady.  Celebrate those guys and don't put them through the gauntlet unnecessarily.
Part 1 - Harbaugh, Part 2 - College Football, Part 3 - NFL, Part 4 - How to grow viewership in all sports
Mr know it all Joel klatt pick Ohio st to beat Michigan and guess what and Joel pick Alabama to beat Michigan and he was wrong once again, I use to believe in this guy but he is always wrong like collin
Hes not LEAVING!!!!! STOP blabbering click bait and fibbing headlines!
Are they forgetting that December is finals time for these KIDS! I’m all for the changes in college sports yes pay the athletes that we are profiting from but to say we are leaving money on the table and could benefit from scheduling better why don’t we slow down and think why that may be. Not all of these kids are league bound why don’t we give them a chance to take advantage of there free education fellas. Love the show thanks
The ACC sucks lol 💯
Hail to the cheaters  Valiant Hail to the conquering cheaters. Hail hail to Michigan The cheaters of all time.  Harbaugh you should be ashamed of yourself.
I think Penix can still be good in the NFL, people forget even the Goat Brady looked pedestrian against the good fronts that the Giants had. Any defense that can get pressure with only 4 guys is going to make anyone look bad unless they can scramble like Lamar but that’s really rare.
Wanted to see if they mentioned the Bears as a Harbaugh destination.  Still havent fired our terrible coach or OC as of yet.
Cheaters gonna cheat
Leave for the NFL
It’s I’m listening to you guys talk you are missing what made quarterbacks like Montana and Brady so good was their ability to lead and study. I watched Brady I watched Montana I watched Harbaugh play in college and in the NFL, I look at McCarthy as a leader his heart and drive and ability to study and it reminded me a lot of Brady and Montana not saying he will be as good as them only time will tell, Penix was not a leader in the game last night he was a very talented player who made plays but not a leader. You are looking at these guys wrong athletic ability and being able to make great throws is only 20% of what is needed it does help but not what you are chalking it up to be!
I don't think an NFL return is up to whether or not Jim Harbaugh wants to return, but rather whether or not a team wants him over the next hot shot young assistant or even a guy like Quinn who is an extremely successful DC and had success with the Falcons.  The real question is whether or not Harbaugh can combat the poor personal reputation that Jed York has poisoned the league with.  People forget that 18 jobs have opened up since Harbaugh won the B1G Title in 2021.  18 teams said "no thank you" to him, not the other way around.  This guy would have the second winningest career record if he entered the league tomorrow.  Everyone knows Jim Harbaugh can coach.  The question is whether or not these team's GMs and owners want to deal with a strong and unique personality like Harbaugh's.  I think that's why he just won't announce he's leaving to pursue an NFL job.  He could have left Michigan after last year if the interest from the NFL was reciprocated.  Michigan's administration was ready to hire Sherrone Moore if/when Harbaugh leaves (which is why Gattis had left).  I don't think he would've left Michigan until he left them in a better spot.  Michigan's been in a better spot for 3 years now.  He's not gone because he's unsure of leaving Michigan, but rather he's unsure of the NFL's reciprocated interest in himself.  The NCAA and B1G wants him gone from Michigan.  It's just a question of whether or not a NFL teams wants to put their money where their mouths are.
Klatt - “Ringing the bell” instead of take time and enjoy what you’ve built. Allow your children to complete their education in Michigan - NOPE! Always BUCKEYE SLANT - Get him out and in to NFL. Klatt - blows.
Is Jim hardbaugh a good coach yes ...but to try to put him in the great like Nick Saban multiple natties at 2 schools, urban Meyer multiple natties at 2 schools, Pete Carroll is absurd !!! Would you all stop kissing his rear end and be real come on !!! You are complete jokes to want to put him in that realm is crazy winning one natty!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
Joel Klatt by far is the best guest on this show and also the best announcer/voice for College Football 🫡
Too bad there was all the cheating issues.  that will mar this championship for many no matter what anyone says. The NCAA did not act whether to clear or not clear UM so many will believe UM is guilty and just there because they cheated.  Sad.
Go Blue!!! Natty Champs 🏆
I'd love to see Joel covering the draft and combine with Colin
I wish Joel can be on all year man
Harbaugh still has a house near Lis Angeles
He has to win more than one natty to have a legacy 😂😂😂
Like Mariah Carey during Christmas til the next CFB season Joel ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
Don’t let them fool you Michigan, and Washington have been in the playoff multiple times it’s not like we’re getting anything that different is still the halves and the halves not
The recruiting violation against Harbaugh is a joke.  All because he bought a kid 3 cheeseburgers.  The NCAA has unfairly painted a target on his back.  I'm so glad he now has a championship to his name.
Jon Belien left UM also for being disgusted with the NCAA
Michigan is not the template to win a Natty. They struck lightening in a bottle. They had 44 seniors/super seniors.  This was a one off IMO.  Harbaugh is gone for many reasons, but one is his roster next year is not good as a whole.  Michigan hasn’t recruited well either.  I don’t think Michigan is a playoff team next year. Look at their schedule… they’ll have at least 3 if not 4 losses.
Harbaugh has two choices:  A lifetime contract for 12mil or so a year.  Can spend rest of his life as the Son of Ann Arbor.  Him and his family are royalty on campus/in town.    OR - go to NFL and fired after three years cuz your QB got hurt, losing record and owner wants some new “it” offensive genius coordinator on the market.    NFL=NotForLong  For me, it’s an easy decision
God I’m gonna miss this so much!! See ya in August!
Sign Stealer’s
Joe Klatt be on point 💯💯💯
Maye "overlooked"? Most mock drafts have him going #2 overall. That is not "overlooked.
Harbs stays at Michigan.
Why would.Harbaugh want to leave Ann Arbor ??
I love Klatts take on our allegations. He knows more than these espn slappies
If Klatt knew that “spygate” having any impact on results was totally ridiculous, he should have said this two months ago instead of waiting until it became totally obvious and safe to say
If Jim Harbaugh isn't on the autism spectrum I don't know who is.
This means everything to all us younger UM fans who suffered forever with rich rod, hoke, and the first half of harbaugh
Cemented as a cheater.
Penix got sacked ONCE last night and got stepped on by his own player in the 3rd quarter and dude could barely walk back in the tunnel afterwards needless to say he’s soft asf and he won’t last in the nfl bc of that
If mike macarty falls flat on his face in Dallas. Jerry should go after jim
Totally agree. ESPN is holding college football back. I had to listen to the game on the radio last night like it's  the 1930s because I don't have ESPN and a lot of people are the same.
Personally, I think it should be like this as of right now so much going on. I think the Jim Harbaugh needs to enjoy his family take him with vacation, and when the time is right, he will make the decision who he wants to play for or rather coach where is the NFL or his college football it should be his decision when he think he’s ready right now the man needs to enjoy his family, his friends and take a break because he deserve it and no more media involved in his life until he makes that decision no matter how long it takes For the man to enjoy his family that’s the main thing and the main focus college football not Nfl when the time is right the man will make his decision and he’ll follow his heart and then Goblue cheers enjoy the moment. That’s what Coach Harbaugh should do. 🏆🫵💛💙🍷🏟️
His legacy is cemented as a thief......
Jim Harbaugh has been one of the top 5 best coaches in all of football really since San Fran, maybe even Stanford. His only drawback is routinely inheriting dumpster fires that he has to totally rebuild from the ground up... it takes a whle to truly implement his style and get the rigit players to execute it.
my two in sports cause they don’t do all the emotional stuff and all the bs clown stuff just talk sports and be fair perfect show and this is all i really watched and i grew up on espn just the skip and smith type is just trash tv sports to me and i hope sharpe doesn’t go down that road
Michigan job is better than any pro job.
Thought Colin was doing an Eminem song for a sec
See you in 7 months, Klatt.  You will be missed.
"Jim deserves better"? Good God man, FSU deserved better.
Nobody in Ohio (with brains) is saying a damn thing about Vrabel. All of Ryan's losses are to top 10 teams in the AP. Meyer lost to Virgina tech, Purdue and Iowa.   Stop lumping us all into the anti ryan day bs. That's you guys (media) making that narrative.
Colin “if it’s a 12 dollar stock, buy it” cowherd
I hope he stays at Michigan.  He belongs there . Go Blue
Colin goes on and on about the Chargers job.   Yes Herbert is talented, but you have a cheap owner with no history of success.   Add in they are $34 million over the cap and are an afterthought in the LA sports scene.    I don’t find it all that attractive.
Both of you guys are the best in the business along with Rich Eisen .   Go Blue
go to Washington and draft JJ Blake Zach.
F the sparklers doesn’t matter who coaches there or plays there they will NEVER win there the sparklers
PLEASE GOD! BRING HARBAUGH TO CAROLINA!!!!!!
The first time this stupid cartoon got me to laugh at one of their episodes in years
I AM DONE WITH NICK SERIANI HE IS STUBBORN AND NOT A GOOD COACH. THERE WAS A REASON ANDY REID FIRED HIM. I SAY FIRE ALL COACHES ECEPT OFFENSIVE LINE COACH. LET'S GET JIM HARBAUGH, MIKE MCDONALD, OR REX RYAN, BRING BACK DUECE STALEY. I AM DONE WITH THESE COACHES. THE DEFENSE SCHEME SUCKS AND THE PLAY CALLING IS HORRIBLE ALL YEAR.
He wipes Bo off the map Joel stop it Bo couldn’t win a National championship
START HOLDING SINGS IN PHILLY FIRE NICK HIRE JIM HARBAUGH!!!!
Hey guys, please read my comment. So I hope you do as media personnel. I think it's your job to do and help the Eagle fans. We all are cheering for Jim Harbaugh to be the next head coach. I want Philly fans to hold up signs outside the stadium fire, Nick Seriani! 🔥 Higher Jim Harbaugh harbaugh Nothing is wrong with Bill, but I think Jim is the better option you'll have an offensive coach. Mind that can utilized, the talent on the offense better, and he likes to run a defensive scheme like his brother in Baltimore. I am all 4 of Baltimore take defense. They've always been good on defense. I think Jim Harbaugh is the band best answer for the team.  But there's media people. You can try to push the narrative with other podcasters. People in the news people on TV talk about how Eagle fans want Jim as the next step coach. The owner needs to understand this. What the city of Philadelphia once Jeffrey Lori.  He needs to talk to Howie Roseman and tell him to work with Jim. Get him here no matter what the Coit's share. Power with Jim cause I could see him. Share power with him, and it could be a match made in heave. N with Howie Roseman teamed up with Jim Harbaugh. They can put their collective minds together and have even better drafts.  Because they are good at what they do, how we can run the general management, the cap, get the players, and Jim can do the coaching. They don't have to rely on analytics as muse it as a tool not to do everything. But I hope everybody starts chanting and holding up signs near the stadium so they can see and have the owners go get an established coach.  My number one pick is Jim Harbaugh. They need to go after him hard and get him. As Eagle fans, we need to do everything we can to convince the ownership. We want an established coach like Jim. We need to go after somebody who can install the culture back into Philly. So please everybody do your part. Tell friends, especially if you know people in Philly. If I lived in Philly, i'd be holding up signs at the stadium every day. Except when I have to work, just so they can see them. Hire Jim Harbaugh, please. For the love of God, make it happen.
STOP BLAIMING HOWIE ROSEMAN THIS IS ALL NICK SERIANI. 2021 WAS HORRIBLE UNTIL SHANE STICKEN TOOK OVER HE RAN THE OFFENSE IN 2022, AND NICK IS IN CONTROL 2023. IT'S HIS MESS HE DECIDES THE DEFENSE SCHEME AND PICK THE COACHES. ITS HIS PASS HAPPY PREDICTABLE OFFENSE DOES NOT WORK HE IS ARROGANT AND STUBBORN DOES NOT CHANGING ANYTHING I THINK AFTER SHANE LEFT HOWIE GAVE POWER TO NICK TO SHOW HES A WEAKNESS TO GET HIM FIRED. I BEAT HOWIE GAVE SHANE STICKEN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE OFFENSE LAST YEAR. I BET JEFF LOREY GAVE POWER TO NICK AND HOWIE IS LETTING NICK DO HIS THING KNOWING HES NOT THE COACH THIS IS SCREAMING NICK SERIANI IS THE REASON FOR ALL THE PROBLEMS. I THINK THE OWNER LET NICK TAKE CONTROL AND HOWIE IS LETTING IT HAPPEN TO GET RID OF NICK. LET'S HOPE AFTER HE IS FIRED. HE GOES GET JIM HARBAUGH OR MIKE MCDONALD. FLY EAGLES FLY 🦅
MAYBE IF ENOUGH FANS TELL JEFF LOREY TO HIRE JIM HARBAUGH THEN HE WILL!!!
START HOLDING SINGS IN PHILLY FIRE NICK HIRE JIM HARBAUGH!!!!
Harbaugh is one weird guy.
It's cemented as the Harbaugh/Stalions cheating era.
Michigan ran its way into the History books with its 12 National Championship! Go Blue!
The energy and hype around college football will always outshine the NFL... but I agree it's a hot mess
GO BLUE! 〽️
Love these two! Wish y’all had a show together everyday!
Harbaugh is 100% gonna be coaching one of: Chargers, Bears, Raiders, Commanders. As a Chargers fan, obviously I have a preference but he is for sure going to one of those spots.
Not only did Michigan vs Washington give hope to other programs that aren’t power houses, but it gives hope to institutions with a higher academic standards, that you can win a Natty. No one has mentioned that!
I expect more expertise from Klatt than Cowherd.    If you watch JJ career he has played in many big games at Michigan and has given the Wolverines a chance to win.   I like Penix but he is surrounded by multiple first round, second rounders and third round offensive talent at Washington,  let me tell you that's as good as it gets because in the NFL you will be lucky to have one Odunze in your squad.   One thing I do agree is that JJ needs to get more seasoning.  JJ needs to read defenses better and Penix will be a solid NFL starter.   There is one QB that is growing on me and that's Bo Nix
The fact this is the last time I’ll be able to see this segment for months makes me so sad 😢
Joel is great!
The Chargers job is a BAD job!  You’re STUCK with the 6th best QB in the AFC(Mahomes, Jackson, Burrow, Allen, Stroud) who is paid like the 1st best QB.   Terrible cap space. A losing culture, no home field advantage and cheap ownership. And the division has 2 future hall of fame coaches n in Reid and Payton.
If the NCAA is targeting Harbaugh it sure didn't seem that way with the way the refs officiated that game
I think McCarthy would make a fantastic backup QB for the next 15 years in the NFL. Like Gardner Minshew. he can come in for a few games and at least not lose you those games with dumb mistakes.
Jim isn't going anywhere.
He’s going to the Patriots.
The way Klatt described Jim Harbaugh is exactly what a coach should be. I think the Chargers are the most appealing job for a variety of reasons. Washington's best luring factor is the amount of cap they have which is great but it doesn't equal what the Chargers can offer in a top 3-5 QB, top 10 LT, (in a QB and Tackle heavy start to this draft that's important), the 5th pick in the 2024 draft, Southern California location, and arguably the most important next to having the franchise QB already is the chance to take his legacy to the next level. Harbaugh in LA has the chance to bring the Chargers franchise their first ever Superbowl along with his own because now that he has nothing left to prove in College he can go back and finish in the NFL. He would go down in history as one of the greatest coaches of all time. Money is nice and all but Jim isn't broke I think his legacy is what he cares about more. This isn't even considering the potential brotherly rivalry he has with John who beat him in the SB he probably would have the best chance of beating him in the regular season or post season.  Overall I understand why Washington is appealing but LA is just the better spot for him.
THE Michigan Wolverines have THE best fight song AND helmet logo in the country hands down 🫳🎤
Bad year for Harbaugh and Lamar haters. 😂
Joe is awesome.
Klatt for league commissioner!
vindicating to hear the truth about Harbaugh come out. We champs
So glad someone is talking about the ineptitude of NCAA.
Gotta disagree with the number of "NFL type throws" Penix was asked to do. First thing I noticed is how many throws were screens, bubble screens, rb out in the flat, etc. He did not throw downfield all that much.
Penix a late round picc he a little to brittle needs to sit behind a starting qb get some weight/muscle on his body and just rest because every time he gets touched he take 3mins to get up frm the hit
Joel is spittin!!
Not even a chance to celebrate Michigan win, and already talking about what NFL teams he should coach? At least give a few days...let the paint dry first!!!!!
No one is talking about Harbough to the Patriots. He is offensive. He can buy the groceries. He gets a top pick to get his QB. Great defense only has to fix the offense. They are only talking about Vrabel.
as long as they hired the oc as head coach michigan fans i believe would be more than happy to see jim go to next level. its only if he takes his whole staff where things will get weird legacy wise if the pros dont go as planned
Way to go Michigan. You earned the championship. Best team in the country. Very happy for you. I'm happy for my Washington Huskies. Had an amazing season. No regrets. Now I'm anxious to hear if Jim Harbaugh's coaching decision will impact coach DeBoer. As long as our staff stays together, we will compete and have another chance at the championship.
"Sticking it to rigid people with agendas!!!" That's why I love Vivek! Great take Colin.
Don't forget the Bears man he literally played there his whole career
I think Penix and JJ will be better than Drake maye
Good duo talking CFB
Just glad the SEC didn’t win, College Football is so much better when it’s not regional.
They are talking about “Vrabel to Ohio State” like it isn’t 4 people in the whole world asking for that
Forget about giving Klatt a franchise tag he deserves a lifetime extension
Legacy of being a cheater. * championship. Should be vacated!
Turns out cheating does matter 🤷‍♂️
I’d love to hear what Joel thinks will happen to some of these lower bowl games- the 6-6 and 7-6 Bowl games at the beginning of December. With NIL and the transfer portal dictating much of the latter portions of the season, do we really need all of these relatively meaningless bowls.
Did anybody else catch that stupid comment Colin made about Herbert being better than AROD that Lafluer inherited who won back to MVPs & led the packers to 3 consecutive 13 win seasons..? yet Herbert can’t even make the playoffs most seasons and is 0-1.
The country is so estatic that the SEC didn't win..... its crazy lol
These 2 need an inmediate reaction pod every Saturday night for the college games like Colin does on Sunday nights for the NFL games
Harbaugh is a lying dirtbag. He's gonna pull a Carroll lol
Joel and Colin were two of the ONLY sports personalities that believed in Jim even through the worst parts.
If he was going to sign that extension, he would have already…he has nothing else to prove at Michigan…back to the NFL he goes!
Nick Saban tried so Harbaugh should stay in Michigan
Bo never won a championship
Joel Klatt just great at what he does
I’m loving how he’s automatically going to the NFL.
UNPOPULAR OPINION: JJ and Jim Harbaugh both return to win back to back National Championships. GO BLUE〽️🏆      Let the hating commence. 😅
I have to give Colin credit, he stuck with Harbaugh even at his lowest during the covid year
MICHIGAN RUNS COLLEGE FOOTBALL. BULLYS IN THE TRENCHES. CORUM. MCCARTHY. HARBAUGH. 2023 NATIONAL CHAMPIONS. INEVITABLE.
Washington is a terrible franchise. I don’t see harbaugh going to Washington. They need help in a lot of places and again they don’t have a proven QB.
JJ gonna be a GREAT QB! He can do it all. He can scramble, make plays if he has to, has a gigantic arm, accurate no matter where he throws, very athletic, a heck of a team player and knows how to manage the game if he has to. You can mold him perfectly to your system and he'll do it to a T. A coaches dream. Whoever gets McCarthy is going to be blessed! I hope it's my rams! I'm buying that jersey immediately! McCarthy and McVay could be a Brady and Bill.
Harbaugh wins…never had to bend a knee to the talking heads. Sweeeet!
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that “everyone has a funeral” is still an absolute bar
These two guys always have great intelligent fun...delightfully engaging!
Ok i gotta block this. Please quit recommending this garbage
They wanted to say JJ is the greatest Michigan QB ever. Over Rick Leach, Harbaugh, Grise, Brady, Grbac etc? ? Lmfao! HOW? yes, they won the championship, but give me a freaking break! Like these guys said, he managed the game, running in terror and getting a first down on a single broken play isnt that impressive! Kudos to the guy, he plAyed exceptionally well, but to call him the greatest Michigan QB ever because you’re caught up in the moment?
Klatt is so right about the NCAA violations issue, they care more about cheeseburgers than Lamborghini's, absolute joke
Go BLUE!!!
These guys just need a show together. Heck, throw Nick in there for guest appearances. Always great banter and chemistry.
Yeah, college football makes NO sense. Imagine putting your championship game on a Monday night. It’s not that hard, it can’t be! I’m betting it’s women in charge of the scheduling.
Fascinating that Colin cries out (correctly) that too many fans/owners want instant turnaround even after building/rebuilding a franchise in disarray, yet wants instant success in Chicago, Indianapolis, Carolina, etc. Amusing to realize it takes time..
Daddy’s home
Go Blue!!!
Colin’s father is back how cool
Well deserved
“let’s pour some sauce here it’s a little wild at the family ranch” -Colin Cowherd, in his obligatory family analogy every clip
Imagine him wining a super bowl with DA Bears
Joe capped this gm perfect
Harbaugh either staying in Michigan or going to LAC
Would they have won had Georgia not got stiffed from the playoffs?
Joel Klatt, best guest on the show.   Imagine these two co-hosting...
Great father-son content as always!
Ohio state fans crying hysterically means it is a great day for college football and I’m not even a Michigan fan.
6/10 national championships in the 4 team era.... Sabans "worst team" of the dynasty goes to OT vs Michigan... Id say it's far from over for southern football dominance and where the best players come from. Go ahead and enjoy your year Michigan... its just ironic and hilarious how everything seemed to align just perfectly... in a year you're accused of cheating lmfao.
Finally !
A legacy of sustained, systematic, and successful cheating.
The NCAAF Invitational tournament champions? Georgia and Ohio State should have had a chance to “play it off”, but they weren’t invited to the party.
Klatt on the Herd is must see TV every week during the season
Joel is sad.
