Yo.  I’m in my white T tank top underneath. I look like sloth without the tree I’ve got boys with no teeth. Yep crack central. Meths mental. But pass the menthol so me and my boys can breath. We from the streets. We soldier’s that soldier beats.   Okay enough is enough I’ll end this guy with in a twinkle of an eye never mind a month. Claps of thunder from the sky. I’ll out rap this teen with the Holy Ghost by my side.   In Jesus name  You only got yoooo self to blame.  So strip down your pride in this hall of fame shouting from the roof tops I see no shame that’s why we need a saviour in Jesus name. So be ordained or you’ll be tamed with monster flames that burn your grave. I give you grace. Amen.

Real ones subscribed before old friends dropped 🐐
Not only his flows are clean, he also has a great ear for beats. These are not usual drill beats these are different 🔥
For a second, I thought Peter Parker (Spider-Man) had released a song

Hello random person scrolling through the comments 👋  I hope you're having a great day and staying safe 🌏♥️
This beat is madddd
My guy just put me in the bigger hyped mood ever
how tf does he only have 35.9k subss
UK drill isnt my kind of music but this actually isnt too bad
He produces and raps and sings in 2 different languages like that's actually pretty insane. Musical talent like few in the scene.

Every time this brother posts it’s a banger ❤️

Banger
Been waiting for this ever since i saw the snippet on tiktok
The beats sick, the lyrics compliment it (banger)
From an SEO perspective the song title is so smart. The Weeknd - Can’t Feel My Face is still one of the most viewed vids on YouTube (1.1B) so whenever someone searches for that, this is the first thing that comes up.
