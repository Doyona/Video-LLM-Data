FOX..... DIE!!!!!
Listen, have we created biochemical-computer interfaces yet? We can already use a digital pregnancy test, using science and screens to detect the pregnancy hormone. So why not use chemical reactions on a larger scale, to read DNA sequences by detecting a, t, c, and g? Just a thought for some genius garage scientists y’know?
3:40 I still can’t believe people never talk about china who literally caused a crime against All of humanity everywhere
3:40 we know that china created it bruh
Sorry they didn’t create the vaccine for covid 19 but china dis create covid 19
Nuclear bomb's main damage is not the explosion. It's the radiation.
The 'gene therapy' Covid vaccine was a disaster. Just look at all the US Senate Hearings into Covid vaccines screening on YouTube.
It was actually a plandemic
The last pandemic was from us
技術を悪用するテロリストは学者としての能力が無いから大丈夫と言うような意見をコメント欄にて見かけた。危険な思想を持った宗教団体による化学兵器攻撃を受けた国の人間として言わせてもらうと、それは楽観的すぎる意見だ。1995年に日本の首都を襲った化学兵器攻撃を画策した宗教団体には、高名な大学を出て科学的な専門知識を十分に持った人物がたくさん所属していた。彼らが作ったのは生物兵器ではなかったが、知識も設備もない中、全くの0からサリンを密造し、たくさんの罪のない人を殺した。同じことが生物学分野でも起こらないと確証できるだろうか？ 科学の発展は喜ばしいが、脅威を警戒するに越したことはない。人類はもはや、未来は全てうまくいくと信じるような子供のようではいけないと思う。
This goes back to the how do we know what aliens are gonna do learning how we deal with these problems is what pushes us forward morally, and emotionally in order to be able to conquer the next problem. We can’t just hide from stuff like this. I also have to add the preemptively destroying viruses and other such things. Doesn’t give our immune system a chance to grow
I think this video is biased. It seems that they are trying to defend the original COVID source, and it just felt left wing. Also, people died from the COVID vaccine, (from documentary “Died Suddenly”).  I am not a fan of this video.
It's all good, but if we have lobbying group or insane political group that control that controlling infrastructure, it can be used to do harm to humans.
even if it's not most of the people understand.
Dr. Ian Malcolm: Gee, the lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, uh... staggers me. Donald Gennaro: Well thank you, Dr. Malcolm, but I think things are a little bit different then you and I had feared... Dr. Ian Malcolm: Yeah, I know. They're a lot worse. Donald Gennaro: Now, wait a second now, we haven't even seen the park... John Hammond: No, no, Donald, Donald, Donald... let him talk. There's no reason... I want to hear every viewpoint, I really do. Dr. Ian Malcolm: Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here? Genetic power is the most awesome force the planet's ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that's found his dad's gun. Donald Gennaro: It's hardly appropriate to start hurling generalizations... Dr. Ian Malcolm: If I may... Um, I'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you're using here, it didn't require any discipline to attain it. You read what others had done and you took the next step. You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don't take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now [bangs on the table] Dr. Ian Malcolm: you're selling it, you wanna sell it. Well... - Jurassic Park
'This is scary' Eh. Not really. Planet needs a bit of a deep clean.
Previously unknown Corona virus?? I thought it was discovered back in the 60's, and covid was a variant. I mean I saw it listed on the back of a general can of air freshener, as listed viruses it kills
Great point, but I don't like the idea of hiding information. We already hide too much information, and this is just an excuse to push it further and make it normal. Besides, a really dedicated villain wouldn't need to order the most advanced and deadly diseases. If they have the knowledge and technology they'd be able to make something pandemic level or worse with local ingredients and no one would know. They'd just need two mutations to end all humans. Take the corona virus and mutate until you have something that has a  much longer incubation period say months to years, without symptoms but still contagious. Then mutate that to have guaranteed lethality when symptoms do appear (similar to rabies).

4:46 New bat what virus detected???
Wow I haddent considered these possibilities. Eye opening.
4:45 'the new batshit virus' 😭
RESIDENT EVIL 4 REFERENCE!!?!??!?!?!!?!
Wiping out a huge fraction of humanity would be a godsend
The coronavirus vaccine killed people, the spike protein.
And now we will have robots with artificial intelligence that can built these things easier and better.  Seems like a lot of good ideas.
my teacher has one in class
A vaccine ready for testing... yeah... about that testing... gonna have to skip it...
I see the biggest problem not in somebody using open data to do harm, but in the people who do harm while a virus is in the open. The past pandemic we all somewhat remember wouldn‘t have been such a problem, if it wasn‘t for those anti-social, anti-intellectual, anti-morals people that came out of the sewers of our civilisation. The orange rapist who got elected again after killing more Americans than both of the world wars, the Nazis disgracing Germany a second time not 100 years after the previous time, and if you look a bit through social media, you can‘t get past the scourge of or modern societies. Sadly no virus eradicates this - maybe somebody should misuse open Virus data…
A dangerous perspective!. Greta content!
I'm about halfway through the immune system playlist. Reminds me a lot of the vibes of Cells at Work, and very informative!
Very useful 👌🔥
4:45 Batshit
Never use/make a weapon you can't point.
The fact firearms are regulated and biotechnology isn't is actually insane.
Anthrax is the Most Dangerous Bioweapon not Covid-19. Also the Pink Death is More Deadlier and More Infectious and More Severe than Covid-19.
You still think they made the "vaccines" in a few months? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that's cute
Fire Music Lol
Climate change and corporate greed will wipe us out and beat any of these deadly viruses we love to talk about
AI will help. hail AI!!!
I enjoyed the umbrella corp Easter egg
I thought I understood how the world works—until I read The Obscured Principles book by Dorian Caine. It felt like someone ripped the blindfold off my eyes and showed me the architecture of control that’s been here for centuries. This isn’t just a book. It’s forbidden awareness in printed form.
While everyone argues over politics and news, The Obscured Principles book by Dorian Caine quietly explains how the real game is played. The moment I read it, everything around me looked different. It’s like it gave me the decoder ring for reality.
I’ve spent years chasing answers in documentaries, podcasts, even ancient texts—and none of it hit me the way The Obscured Principles book by Dorian Caine did. It’s like it was written for the few who are ready to break the illusion and remember who they really are.
You ever read something that feels like it was never meant to be in your hands? That’s exactly how The Obscured Principles book by Dorian Caine felt. Ancient wisdom, modern exposure, and a terrifying amount of truth packed into one single source.
Nuclear bombs kill rly quick and my moms slipper kills me slowly so obvs I prefer the bomb
The unknown corona virus?
7:26
If it was easy as this video claims, some maniac would have done it already.
Someone should make a virus that does the opposite of what it’s supposed to. So instead of tired and ill you become energetic and productive.
YET STILL,, NEW & DANGEROUS DISEASE S WILL TAKE OVER.. CAN'T STOP IT.... IT'S PEOPLE NOT THE WORLD WHO MAKES THESE GERMS.............
Love the Resident Evil reference <3
We do know it came from a lab. We knew very quickly as the virus had no genetic history (family tree). It came from nowhere. Hence constructed.
What if we become like the qu
Captain trips
7:26 AMOUNG US
Great video..vezna loves it ❤
LET'S ALL PLAY RESIDENT EVIL (1996) AGAIN 💃🕺💃🕺
4:07  ahh yes dangerous banana
I feel one of the biggest problems with an actually pandemic in the future is that the fake Covid 19 pandemic became so political and media driven that today if you tell people you do anything to avoid a pandemic they will revolt simply because in the past we were lied to. we saw that the consequences from things like masking, lockdown, and forced vaccinations were actually worse than the virus… no one will go along with it in the future.   Good luck lol
"viral of medical journology"
3:51 resident evil reference
Let us get genetically engineered cat girls before we get another pandemic.
"Which viruses are present among us"
1:10. People still don't believe it. Stuck more than a decade in the past.  On a side note, I'm reminded of the Borderlands 3 gene sequencing alignment mini game on the ship.
4:46 uhh what’s that virus called kurzgesagt?
Something’s can come back
Does anyone saw polemon cards in 5.13
What in the Black by Ted Dekker is this 🤣
are there any 16 years old girls?
EPIC
Such hassle. Why not just go straight into "flesh is weak, metal is forever"?
Nature tend to balance the things, more deadly virus is then shorter it's range. This is why HIV, TB and flu have enourmous success.  About coronavirus: we could easy block it by combination of *camostat and sartan* . And COVID was NOT a SARS virus!  Sars gives acute lung inflammation, feat thet covid-19 lacked!!!
5:10 Nintendo switch controller???
It's 2025, and the CDC is being dismantled.
Can you bring the vacuum of space down to earth in a container?
New batsh*t virus discovered 4:47
7:15 They can just make it themselves, though, and what about state-sponsored programs? No individual is building nukes, but countries are.
8:47 The message in the end is so beautiful and I'm upset at myself for feeling like thatd be futile!
Why on earth does a scientist have a Nintendo switch??????
Yeah when I got Covid I fought it off in like 2 days
I got shivers when he said I could build a nuclear bomb in my backyard lol.
The comment section held up!
12 Monkeys, without the time travel
Everything in this video is stated without a hint of skepticism. Keep that in mind. In every other case this creator is very careful to hedge themselves against being wrong. Nope. Not here. Straight down the party line...
If covid killed 7000000 ppl we would all know someone who was killed by it. Hardly anyone does.
washed up channel
I love the resident evil reference at 6:48
Bioterrorism is gonna be the end of us probably😢😢
If Is***l has that, it's definitely bad for humanity.
As a Plegue Inc player my self Dont let anything EVEN REMOTELY close to smt like a bio weapon get in the hands of a strategic and psychopathic plegue inc pro
3:35 Actually, we do know. We know that it was created intentionally by the CCP in a lab and intentionally spread to China's citizens.
Are these things still easy to get hold of ?
4:45 "new batshit virus discovered"
Problem with a virus is that you are never really in control over it. Viruses evolve , so even if you have a vaccine for it , it may become irrelevant in a short time , So your weapon may just end up killing you anyhow.   Biologic weapons are even dumber than nuclear.
Copd. Shingles and God knows what are bio weapons targeting white people
Russia invaded the Ukraine because America was building bio weaponry in a underground military base on the Ukraine Russian border..  Puts a new perspective on who is the bad guys don't you think? ??
cyberpunk 2033
"We can expect even more wonderful things for humanity like miracle crops" ?? As we all concluded till now the more we stray from nature, the more illnesses we bear. And that's not even the worst part of it, mindset like this makes us pollute beautiful places nature nurtures and kill all living around us. I don't know how they can be so ignorant, or something else is in play but surely I'm glad that you people can see something is off.
THOSE WHO DON'T WANT US TO BELIEVE THIS CAN JUST SAY THEY ARE "EXPERTS", WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE THEM AUTOMATICALLY ?  ALSO "EXPERTS" HAVE BEEN WRONG BEFORE !
Can’t wait for the division IRL
Today keir starmers admitted the virus came from wuhan labs
The vaccine used research from the SARS virus as a base which is why it was faster.
4:45 new batshit virus 🔥🔥🗣🗣
As a biologist, this is BS, In theory, yeah, you can perhaps make a very resistant, deadly bacteria in your backyard lab, with nothing but a pressure cooker and cheese making kit! But guess for how long was this information and technology available for everyone? 50y ago+ Why it didn't it happen? Because of many things 1 it's very hard to aime you are probably going to harm yourself and everyone around you before anyone else 2 if someone wants to "convince" someone else with force a loud flashy gun is way more effective than a small silent hard to trace micropistol
Loving the subtle references to Umbrella / Resident Evil!
3:50 Very good company!
Hi, I like how you research with effort, good luck, bye.
Would there ever be a Virus War? What I mean by this is, instead of using Nuclear type bombs, they use Virus gas bombs, where a very spicy virus is dropped on said country. Would they kill the scientists if it was deadly enough, slowing down or preventing a cure? Could humanity keep up with this type of war if it went back and forth, with different viruses?
5:10 Caterpie
At worst? No. Thats at best. Imagine a disease as indestructible and uncuruble as anthrax, as infectious as measles, and as deadly as rabies. It would destroy humanity.
Why i can't save this video to my playlists? I always saving all these videos, bcs i sometimes going back to them or share them.
It's actually true I can myself with only limited experience can infect ????? With Example Covid nh 19 and after 8 weeks the ????? Has survived and developed an antigen.....It's actually not that difficult.  The antigen under a microscope or should I say the virus has become no longer infectious through air born contact....It's amazing.....One should see what I've done to smallpox and Influenza strain B..... 100000% with just a little know how anyone can Create a real nightmare.......😊
As a bio technician that works for Umbrella Corp. We're close to unlocking the secret to longevity.
Or make viruses hunting viruses to stop spread of bad viruses to humans
Im 100% sure that as soon as "dna printers" (machines which can automatically sythesize a string of dna you input) are made available, that that will be the exact moment when dna will be considered illegal knowledge, and removed from the internet  In other words, everyone, make sure to download your virus and bacteria databases now xD
I'm on a stranger's account right now i just want to say what you are saying is true I can easily make a virus similar to corona and in the near future probably one even mire powerful SIKEEEEEE
Oh great. Now Plague Inc. is going to be a nonfiction game.
Gotta say, the biohazard symbol must just be my favourite
Shouldn't really call covid "mild" when it causes multi organ damage, vascular damage, permanent brain changes and much more. Maybe some more literature review was warranted before making these dismissive claims.
umbrella corp?
Amongus Vibes Totally  And seriously you can't complain and can't help either.
I worked on nuclear weapons in the USAF and they don't hold a candle to the damage capable  from biological weapons.
I doubt that corona virus comes from a bat since it's spreadable faster than other virus and killed millions of people. Then how come china is faster on keeping people to shut things up and defensive towards this issue.
Genuinely very depressing that a science and biology channel is spreading misinformation about the ongoing covid pandemic. It can cause significant damage from one seemingly minor infection. Please everyone check out The People's CDC to learn more, this is horrifically dangerous that he is sharing this incorrect info that may harm or kill people
Not one single "Oryx and Crake" comment. Im ashamed
Way to spread the media bias overinflating the damage covid did to society, it was a glorified cold and wasn't worth mainstream news the flu that we deal with every year far exceed's the damage covid was over villinized for a political agenda....shame of you holding yourselves as an educational scientific crital thinking channel while spreading obvious bs 😂
I know this video was 1 year ago but saying this out loud on the internet is the equivalent to going to a second grade school teaching All the students every cuss word in existence and then saying Don't say any of these words or you get in trouble
... I think the covid 19 virus was released on purpose with malice in the forethought
... how about curing cancer rather than making bio-weapons????
Well I wish it was so easy to make biological weapons, it's hard to explain why , let's me put like this being a champion in football doesn't make you a champion in basketball, there isn't a perfect bioweapon to be made, the closest thing was coronavirus, but still that doesn't mean that aren't dangers from bioengineering, just not what you think , still open reached will help understand this dangers and take measures to avoid them
3:50 Frickin Umbrella Corps
"New Batsh!t virus discovered" is not something I thought I'd see in a Kurzgesagt video.
Haha aged well, it was definitely made in a lab confirmed 😄
Kurz... you're such an alarmist. All the evil intent in the universe can match the overwhelming nature of Nature. Probability has run through all this and our immune system kept up. You can't beat attrition of natural selection
7:26 when the virus is sus
THEY CREATE THE DISEASES THAN PLAY LIKE THEY GOD ND PRETEND TO HAVE A VACCINE BUT ALL ALONG INJECTING YOU WITH THE DISEASE…. STOP LYING 👌🏽
COVID 19 + PFIZER + ASTRA  = MAKE MORE & MORE MONEY

Teşekkürler.
Teşekkürler.
Can't you just let AI calculate every possible virus and then come up with the safest possible antidote for each of them, so if a new one is discovered, it has already been predicted and countered by AI.  And please let AI give us the perfect recipe from our description.
I just love your work. Today i found out that this video was used to produce an entrance exam essay for medicine course in my city here in brazil. Please keep spreading science over the world!  (Se alguem da Unijui ver isso, curte ai)
We're all gonna die
Small caveat: "freely" but behind a paywall
The last pandemic was our OWN FAULT.
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Matthew 6:19-21
I have covid symptoms with no fever but mild chunks of coughing flem. And no Covid.
I think this video is way too far fetched, and the title is kind of clickbait too. Kind of weird seeing this from a channel I follow.
viruses are the great filter, prove me wrong.  think about it: its the one thing we cant ever truly be on the other side of. well, and war, so i guess we are really our own great filter.
What about the corals?
Most microbiology or virology graduates would not have the expertise to create dangerous pathogens alone, maybe if you start getting to people who worked at the post-graduate level for many years but even then.....
Why are we trying to make plants that are resistant to climate change when we could just, I don't know... STOP CLIMATE CHANGE?
Technically you can make a virus which makes people h****
3:33 Ummm...correction. we knew about the cause of Corona virus - consumption of endangered pangolins. We just couldn't do anything about it
6:41 ElectroBoom laughing at corner
So the covid vax came from muh science and wasnt part of preplanned globalist elite shenanigans? What a load of shit this channel is. Cartoons are not scientific evidence.
King Gizzard - Superbug
Meh. Also regarding all information being shared is not true at all. A lot of firms want to patent for money and countries wouldn’t share bioengineered viruses or things that can be weaponized for obvious reasons.   Agree with others this vid below your average
i alwys wanted to build a bio weapon in my backyard... i just need a backyard now
A primitive nuclear weapon is simple technology, easy to make except . . . getting enough fissile material is *very* hard. And there are some steps to the process which would likely not go unnoticed by the feds. Which is also very fortunate for all of us!  However Bioweapons are terrifying because they could very well soon be created in basements, with ingredients that simply can't be controlled. And as such viruses/bacteria grow they will mutate further. I think this is the greatest threat we've seen in a bit.
I've read the comments, and as a Environmental Biology Graduate they have a great point. Why didn't kurzgesagt address the errors?
Unfortunately it's impossible to control the destructive power of human stupidity...like antivaxers
This is the premise behind the RIFTS setting After the Bomb. A man-made virus went crazy and governments overreacted.
😲
I can literally buy the monkeypox virus from a website crazy
Loved the umbrella corps reference lol
7:26
4:04 i thought that was a sponser lol
What if you have to have a vaccine or cure developed for a virus before you are allowed to publish it?
to all of the participants in this comments ... even the bio-experts .... do you still believe that the vax was a product of having a new virus ??? and that it is thanks to the great hidden advances i technology ?? and that they started looking for one when people where 'supposingly' dying from the virus ??? do you believe in walt disney ??

We have folding at home! Folding at home: a distributed network of computers *sharing information freely* and cooperating with one another to handle the computationally expensive process of protein folding!

Restricting knowledge or capabilities is a thing of the past. That is no longer a good option for anything. From gun rights to malware, restrictions dont work because with the size of the internet and world with complex legal systems allow information to exist no matter what. There needs to be future proofed methods of restriction and protection in an age where people could jusy train a local AI model with biology information and re learn all this anyway.
Don't give them ideas 🥲

Pluh.           Kurzgesgatg-in a nutshell is entertaining awsome and great
I am from the future, we are dealing with Mpox now. It's worse than Covid.
Make a dangerous virus for the purpose of making my immune system unstoppable
Nah they knew all about COVID because it was created in a lab.
This is the worst kurzgesagt video I've seen. Fear mongering with lots of false information.  Every single pandemic to date has come from animal (or environment) to human interaction. This is a real risk. This is what the video should have been about. Not some hyperbolic hit piece on biotech (and nuclear power).... do better Kurzegsagt
3:34 holding water for the chinese government bc that lab was funded by bill gates foundation which also has funded your videos. Its not a debate, scientists were able to recreate the covid virus through engineering, proving it originated in a lab. Good job being propagandists
3..2..1..
4:45
Watching this again while being a biotech engineering major its kinda dystopian but also exciting
If a new virus can be easily managed and its spread easily stopped (albeit with a modest number of infections and death), it will make being hit with one less of a big deal.  Just like missiles are constantly repelled by that 'iron dome' of Israels making the fact that missiles were launched at all much less of a big deal.  Not that we should not develop these defenses, but that conducting warfare this way is an even shorter path to total species-wide disaster.
If it is $1000 to sequence someones dna, then how do these genetic testing places charge less than $100?
Theres alot of scientist in here huh 👍
My guess is either eco terrorists or a crazy ‘lone wolf’ will be the first ones to create use weaponized viruses.   The radical side of environmental activists clearly view humanity as bad for the planet and think there are too many humans. My guess is eco terrorists might be easier to identify and stop as they organize into activist groups, but if they succeed it’s likely to be a more devastating attack (significant resources available to them).  Lone wolf terrorists can work in isolation with a mix of mental illness and ideological motivations. While I think a lone wolf bio terror attack would be less deadly as resources and planning are more limited, they also would be much harder to identify and stop.   It seems unlikely to me that a rogue state or Islamist terrorist group would utilize a virus bio weapon. Their desired attack is more targeted towards a specific group and such a bio weapon would hit their own country/people.
You guys should make YouTube channels for different countries in there language like Mr beast. You’d make a lot more money
you guys always bringing up and owning your mistakes is such a nice thing to see

What no one appreciates is how truly far we still are from custom genetic design. Identifying genes and their protein products is like figuring what bricks, wood, and nails are.  It doesn’t tell you anything about how to build a house or a library, or a suspension bridge.  The vast majority of the genome is not genes it’s the programming. The instructions of an immensely complicated mechanical program/computer that implements the genes. It will take 100 years to even begin to be able to manipulate and implement meaningful changes.
The Flood
The what if you could build a nuke in your backyard 😂😂😂😂
Bros giving me ideas
Covid-19 origins subject to debate? It's subject to POLITICAL debate but all serious scientists agree it was man-made. You have a virus with markers ONLY left by genetic engineering 'suddenly appear' right next to a lab that was doing gain-of-function research. A lab that had been cited for shoddy safety practices. A lab specifically doing said research on coronaviruses. I think this is an important video but let's not lie about things. It's more important that people realize the risks because bad actors are ALREADY weaponizing this technology.
All these advances and the era of genomics, and you still only get offered your typical inflammatory markers of CRP, ESR, FIBRINOGEN lol. Wake up, people. Healthcare has been culling us for decades by allowing chronic inflammatory sickness to persist.
Hope 10 years later I will get to see a goofyily funny looking parasuar then
Fat chance, no way will humanity control a virus, multiple pandemics have proven that we can’t act fast enough.    One person with a highly contagious bug can travel around the world in a few days passing it on to passengers on public transport and aircraft.
I specifically remember them lying and saying that they had been working on that C word vaccination for decades. Well well well.
3:18 really gave me a mini heart attack
Excellent - the secret is not to ignore a threat or panic and hide from a threat. It is to understand and be prepared to counter the threat. Design and test powerful anti viral's and anti bacterials. Allow many of these to be used to make the human race healthier. Then invent and prepare for mass production even more powerful antivirals and antibacterial and keep them confidential so that that a dangerous person could not design a way around the counters. Then we have a healthier world effectively prepared against bad actors. In effect we would have something we could spray around all the areas of population that would simply destroy any anti human diseases. We will be able to make that in time, first against the well know enemies like ebola, marburg and plague then immune system stimulants to give the body a permanent advantage in the battle for existence.
2:42 swear word here
That’s bomb it’s going to explode everything it’s scary
Very advanced aren't we. We can control the weather and cleanse our counterparts all at the same time. We are SOOO ahead of ourselves.... round of applause for us all 👏
Can you make כתוביות in Hebbrow ples🥺🥺🥺
I don't know what's happened to me but I'm unable to get ill anymore. It doesn't matter what virus it is I'd be the only person left if it happens
3:50 ayooo? Is that umbrella corporation?
In total there are 51 BSL-4 facilities around the world compared to 450 Nuclear reactors.  It's actually a lot harder to create virus than to create nuclear bomb.
information should be freely available rather than hold up by billionaire information landlords.
the most dangerous weapon on this world is the woke community forcing opinions upon others...  im kinda getting sick and tired of these woke people forcing the BS they keep spouting...  no i have nothing about diversity, and fun fact, what most people call minorities, i just call humans!
How dangerous are there?
The Hated One is right about this channel
It is far easier to control Nuclear and Atomic secrets and techniques than doing so for Bio-hazard materials. Why? Because of the rare isotopes and radioactive element purity and need for critical mass plus the ignition mechanism which is extremely difficult to achieve even for those in the field and uses specific mechanisms only. That is why only powerful nations, working for decades have had these bombs. None of these difficulties or extreme purity or complex mechanisms is so true for Biohazards. You could have them at near ordinary temperatures, with usual lab equipments and the "DATA" is available among more researchers/scientists to begin with and really more de-centralized (As any Biology subject is). What we need is a control mechanism, much the way we restrict the worst elements in society and public/ research community/ rogue scientists- violence, weapons, and the like.
kurzegeBS pretending that *USAMRIID and Eco Health Alliance* weren't studying Covid and covid-like viruses since 2010. LOL  Propaganda.
the vaccine was patented before covid went viral... alex jones showed the patent papers, then youtube banned him
Psychopath taking notes for costing models 🤣🤣🤣
I disagree
6:43 dr bombastics bomb tutorial 💀💀😂😂
Wait those are the only ways COVID started my school told us a Chinese man who they made racist remarks about apparently are a bat and then got drunk and did it with 13 women. wow I now realise how weird my school was
Disappointing to see lab leak kookery spill into your otherwise great channel. :(

To Be Honest Just Use The Shared Information of A Virus And Create An Antidote For It 🧠
We now know that certain covid-19 came from a lab leak but people who had common sense back in 2020 new that from the start
Thanks for the ideas
why do they re-use the dog from the rabies episode so much?
I loved the reference to umbrella

I ⎌don’t think I have a good idea of what to do with my life right now because I’m so stressed 😊 thank
This video is absolute crap
Knowledge without wisdom or morality to guide it will always end in tragedy.
This might be Resident Evil
We found one in birds that can spread to cows and maybe even humans. This could be very bad.
i will create BronoBacteria it's 150 micrometers bigger than macrophage however i will publish it when vaccines and antibiotics were created against BronoBacteria symptoms nausea and vomiting very harmful diarrhea sepsis and if left untreated brain damage lead to brain dead it will infect cows birds cats and rats and sheep create video about all details it has 3 cells there are two ways to destroy suicide warriors destroyed however BronoBacteria are also suicide warrior macrophages can also destroy BronoBacteria but it could take tens or even hundreds it's Body is red it has yellow spikes to vomit chemicals or destroy immune cells it could found in soli contaminated water and mud and more details when you finished BronoBacteria video
ok noooo its boring play roblox
the most dangerous weapon is not a gun, or a bomb, but—
R.I.P.
This is a bit of a fear mongering video with how it mischaracterizes at home experiment CRISPR kits.  I'd also like to point out that  1) you are absolutely tracked and watched if you purchase stuff like that off the internet, even though what you can order aren't pathogens.  2) detailed nuclear device plans are freely available to the public. It's not an issue because of the amount of specialization you need.
06:30 "Or that countries don't try to hide weapons development behind energy programs"... That is clearly the problem. So the first to develop nuclear bombs can do it,but others are not allowed to after that? 👍🏼 nice.. Well played.
isnn't this the same guy that made a video on how to make a black hole bomb xd
尋常感冒病毒，  但 會使受感染的細胞分泌類似普恩蛋白。
Am I the only one who noticed what it said at 4:45 at the bottom of the book
9:01 THAT'S UZBEK PICTURE RIGHT? AM I DREAMING!!!
7:25 help me
Taking down all viruses is technically bad Because our immune system won't be able to deal with 1 if another 1 shows up
The trouble is, the vaccines we develop to counteract the pathogens won't work if enough people don't take them.  We could have avoided so many COVID deaths in the US if people weren't afraid to get innocculated, but the public simply doesn't trust vaccines.  We need to change this attitude if we're going to keep ourselves safe in the future.
Yeah the "vaccine" that the big pharma corps stated they're not responsible for any side effects. Hmmmm.
Nice this will helpful for my mission
10:25 im currently a student and dont have the ability to buy anything online, when i graduate ill for sure buy some of these posters
Bio scientists are panicking
whaaat, investing in public health and safety without immediate returns? dang commies...
Now why wouldnt you have ordered the radio active spider?
i always get this felling when i watch you and now i know why (thxmatpat)
This episode gives a good idea of the power of technology in our lives 🫶 it’s so great to learn about technology and how technology can change the world and how we live 🍀 thank you for sharing your amazing work 🙏
I dunno man! I haven't watched any of the video yet, but I'm 100% sure it's gonna be biological weapons (if I'm wrong I'll look real dumb!) and biological warfare and genetic warfare are crazy but for the sake of the planet specifically... I would argue otherwise! But, if anyone's gonna change my mind it's going to be Kurzgesagt I suppose.
Nice resident evil reference
My nanny's glovés aré moré deàdlie  Me:Walking Nanny:grabs me by the knee ànd màkés me sit on her shoulde r*imbarising*
Only the government has access to nuclear and uses it against people. I don’t trust governments to only have access to this too
The most dangerous man made disease I can think of, would be a mild but infectious disease, that makes a misfolded protein, the type which multiplied in the body and kills the animal over time and can’t be stopped.  I think deer suffer from this, due to it spreading in their urine or something..
Ah yes the vaccine that causes no issues whatsoever because it was extremely untested.
I like this channel but they sure do mention climate change a lot don't they?  I think one particular country needs to do something about their air/water pollution but who knows if they will ever be called out...
Very good informations
Very good video
Lol the unknown coronavirus that was created by man
I guess some people in the comments aren't informed but many scientist and biologist are in agreement that Covid19 came from a lab leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology which studies Corona Virus and has one of largest collection of corona viruses in the planet. They checked where the highest instances of flu like symptoms... It was not anywhere near the market it was all near the institute.
Vaccines are just a defence with a side effect of temopraly weakening immune system before making it stronger ( adaptation time ) that is why rushing with vaccines while pandemic is raging on works same way as Chernobyl reactor shutdown button  ( designed as a safefail but used in desperation makes things worse ) First things that should be used against outbreaks are vitamin C and basic antiviral or antimicrobial drugs
I want to thank all the nerds out there putting in the work to figure things out.
Person in academia for bioengineering here, while there is a significant lack of biosecurity personnel this video is frankly a bit fear-mongering, biosecurity is a significant focus and there are extremely smart people working on this issue
*A weaponised virus in their backyard. Dreams do come true.*
인간이 동물과 공생을 하면서 질병에 대한 방어력이 취약해진 것이다 수많은 세균 바이러스와 박테리아가 들어가 있는 음식을 먹고 살아가는 인간에게 면역력으로 방어를 하지만 면역력으로 부족한 것이며 그것은 질병이나 전염병으로 이어진다 페스터 흑사병 에이즈 코로나까지 대 유행을 하였다 그러나 이러한 질병에 대한 대처법은 아주 미개한 수준의 대처법이다 예를 들어 수중에는 대기보다 몇 천배 바이러스나 세균이 많다 그래도 수중 동식물은 살아간다 즉 점액질이나 다른 방법도 있지만 바이러스 만 잡아먹는 세균과 조류도 있다 인간의 과학은 여기에 대한 지식은 없다 그리고 세균과 바이러스가 동 이온에는 약하나 이에 대한 연구도 없으며 백신 접종은 글로벌 제약회사의 돈벌이 수단이 된 것이다 최초의 바이러스 백신연구는 조류독감에서 연구되었으며 코로나 때 빛을 본것이다 이것을 눈만 돌리면 물의 부영양화를 퇴치하는 방법까지 나온다
meanwhile no one have ever developed bio weapons except "official governments" and no one ever developed nuclear weapons but "office governments" and no one ever used weapons of mass destruction but "the leaders of the free world" and not against evil armies or terrorist organisation but on a civilian population   when you fail to stress the real evil on this world you're collaborate or at the very least a hypocrite
LMFAO I had to stop and laugh at the example of a "local computer repair shop" building an iPhone and then students building iPhones themselves...as if Apple wouldn't sic entire teams of legal experts on all of them.  They don't even want people repairing the ones they made without paying them money constantly to be "certified" or whatever.  All these amazing breakthroughs are always...well, amazing, but the power of humans to ruin things becoming greater than our power to build them is the greatest of modern milestones.  Negligence as implied here, willing stupidity to avoid responsibility, or outright greed...all sorts of things!
Thank you little bird
God be like how did you get tohse cheats so fast
1:44
I myself who works at a medical laboratory was surprise that we were able to create the covid vaccine soo quickly i was expecting for it to be more than a year to solve.
Where are the berbs??
I like the Resident Evil reference.
The US government is too 'fighty' amongst themselves... - Except it completely effects everyone... - AND: they have a serum for you to inject... lol - Kurzgesagt calls it 'progress'.
“It’s complicated. Really expensive things got cheap, and knowledge of how to do impressive things spread freely.”  I don’t think it’s that complicated - it’s just the free market + freedom of speech, we’ve known those rights to be massive boons to creativity and progress for centuries now
It isnt bio nuclear weaponry either. Its the internet.
5:10 care for some animal crossing new horizons anyone?
This video is so on piont. We do need cures to pandemics be made availible faster than ever due to increasing ease at which even private scientists can make things ever more so. However mundane things that would be greenlit to buy could be manipulated at home on the pc and then ordered that would be bad. This same quickness would also damand a expansion if the human species number or the spreading of sentience to other life forms as risk managment strategies. The craziness to come will be able to be stopped in my opinion so we just have to get tough and accept what this means for us and live with it
Something is seriously wrong with that dog
COVID CAME FROM A LABORATORY-
It came from a lab in China… everyone accepts that except China and those in bed with the CCP.
I hope North Korea never takes over the world
The cohid vaxx was worse than the disease. The fact that it was forced upon the global populace for corporate profits was what I would consider an abject failure. Just saying
I somehow don't believe we could wipe out humanity with a bioweapon. Could end civilization as we know it, sure, but wipe out humanity? Probably not. There's just so many of us, even if only 0.01% survive that's still around 70 million people. We'd rally and rebuild after a couple hundred years
4:45 not the book-
What is the vela incident?
3:36 no, it wasn't "accidental"

6:46 doctor bombastic bomb tutorial💀
It's a reminder of the urgent need for responsible stewardship of this powerful technology as we navigate its potential risks and rewards.
i love your videos!!!
It doesn't matter how powerful the weapon is, what matter is the who controls the weapon
1:12 even though it only took them a couple months to create a vaccine there was not enough time for testing also there was less covid cases and deaths then study’s show.
The less diseases you are exposed to, the more chance you die, remember that. Also, the Coronavirus 19 mostly killed old people, just so you know.
So , in basic words , we are all manipulators.
Human intelligence is a cure for the problems it has created.
This guy has taught me so much
Bro only is the Germans had him in WW2💀
A major problem not mentioned in the video is that vaccines (coming from a pro-vaxxer) need 5 (or even more) years to be tested for long-term effects. Biotechnology has definitely progressed a lot in the latest years, but this has nothing to do with testing for side effects possible in the future. It is not right to promote one-sided knowlege to people who don't know much on the topic and would take it for granted to prove a political idea.
Sam Harris convinced me that we are 100% destined to kill ourselves with a bioweapon. How can we possibly stop it when a hobbyist will have the necessary knowledge and tools. Its too difficult to stop it and is becoming accessible to a point where its a certainty someone will try
From the very beginning the developers of nuclear weapons were extremely reckless, knowledge of how to build them spread, weapons were tested in areas where there were people (incl their own soldiers).
i suddenly have the urge to search up how to make a deadly virus from my living room
argh the last part about the poster and working to be better really made me tear up, you guys are amazing🥲
1:02-1:08 fun fact: a furry worked on the vaccine ( i think)
4:46 a swear word in a kurzgesagt video?
7:26
12:12 It's literally a wikihow tutorial XD
New batshi virus💀
First time i ever hard downvoted a video in this series.
Love this channel’s takes
The thumbnail 😍😍
This video encourages more information control and centralized government power in the name of the greater good.  What could possibly go wrong?
Human beings don't clean up messes until they have been made.
"unknown virus"  yeah...
just saw the title and wanted to say : stop it. STAAAAPH!!
QUESTION: in response to a pandemic outbreak, why wasnt one of your proposed solutions to shut down the entire economy??
they always promise heaven  yet we always get hell
Imagine pre-ordering Covid-24 and saying it was just a prank.
08:04 Yeah, spending time under UV lights may be not the best idea.
I looked into this. No. 1, I found that Anthrax Lethal Factor was very easy to buy, I never needed a license to confirm my identity and my age. No. 2,  I also found Corona Viruses for sale a little bit more security but licenses aren't a reliable way for age confirmation mainly because, a child could possibly get their hands on a parent's/ legal guardian's license. Although what I just explained a license is a good start in order to regulate the movement of dangerous biological diseases.
The fact that we will probably one day live in a world where almost no one ever gets sick is crazy
How is this channel free? Like its better than any school
The part about not knowing if the virus was a lab leak is a lie. You’ve basically ruined everything I’ve ever thought I learned from your channel. Goodbye
4chan users about to start anew war
Am I the only one who realized the descriptions of the books?
C-19 that everyone got
Kurzgesagt said crap… my life is complete
wild how 7 million people can die from a virus outbreak and no one be held accountable
Anyone realise the high school is a prison?
Just a funfact, about 32 nuclear bombs from America disapeared since 2003. Make a video about it.
i made my cat explosive from a youtube video... what did you do this weekend?
TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING *starts coughing*
3:49 nice resident evil reference 💯
The worst weapon is not nuclear. The worst weapon is yet to be created, or better yet has not undergone emergence. It's going to be a malicious AI. Because it can easily disrupt all of society via social media, it would take far less physical resources to cause absolute chaos and misery in the world. It won't need labs, it won't need much at all really. And the worst part is those who can't understand intellect, both natural and artificial are going to be most susceptible and least capable of understanding they're being manipulated.
Ethereum block chain smart contracts can help track and add transparency to whom is buying and experimenting with viruses
We have the most dangerous weapon. We are not giving it to random people if anyone asks.
It is spider man all over again where the lizard spreads his disease all over the world
8:19 Biotech is Godzilla!!! Sepultura warned us about this in 1993!!!
Ummm, they were able to break down Covid so fast cause it was created in a lab. They released its breakdown 2 months before the outbreak.
grandpa nurgle would be proud
Not in humans but, read about the fuck up of myxomatosis
Biotechnology ain't what so bad. Like all technology, it's in the wrong hands: cut-throat corporations don't really care when lots of people die from what they make.
Resident evil fans gonna have a field day with this
we need to stop experementing or else we will make the zombie apocalpse
Lets wait until the world becomes halo
Covid was made in a lab no surprise they reverse engineered it in a couple of weeks
Dying Light be like
my dads belt is still deadlier
Clearly these scientists haven't read The Maze runner lol
a guy made an remote controlled bomb. It exploded and killed 4 people and injured many others. He learned to make a bomb through internet
we made dogs!
did i see a resident evil reference
Humanity's self control to reign in the base parts of it's nature evolves so slowly. Deadlier technologies evolve so quickly! This is the great filter.
The poor pug!
From this video i learned that nukes are no longer dangerous and that information must be limited. And that this channel is sponsored by wef. Which is obvious from it's contents
I’m glad they brought up info-hazards because I’ve been thinking about that a lot and I honestly don’t know how I feel about it. The idea that information is too dangerous to spread makes sense.  But what if we made certain information illegal? Is that ethical? Should knowledge ever be restricted or limited, even for a good reason? Not confidential or private knowledge, but just… knowledge.  For example, if a time traveler went back and made knowledge of how to split the atom illegal to share or possess. Would that be ethical? It would save millions of lives, but can you arrest someone just for knowing something? For understanding science? Where do you draw the line on infohazards? Who decides what’s hazardous or how severe it is?  On one hand I believe knowledge is free, ideas and knowledge should be shared as openly as possible to as many people as possible because maybe some seemingly odd information about designing a gun might help an engineer design a safer braking system for elevators or something… an idea he wouldn’t have come up with without seeing a mechanism on that gun. Sure, someone might take that information and make guns and blah blah… but is that worth locking that information away? Because it might be dangerous in the wrong hands?  Where does the line between info-hazard and personal responsibility exist? Knowledge is just knowledge. If a person finds out how to make Molotov cocktails, and then uses them in a riot… was that info-hazard or personal responsibility?  Because I know how to make napalm… I also know decent origami and butterfly knife tricks, and cooking. I’ve never actually made napalm, I’ve never attacked anyone with my balisongs and I never intended to… that’s my personal responsibility.  But I do know some crazy people would use napalm. I know some people absolutely would use my knife tricks for intimidation and to hurt others…   I dunno. The whole concept of an infoahazard messes me up. Because I exist on both sides. I love learning, I love knowledge and teaching people and absolutely love random knowledge and learning totally random skills and information…  But I’ve also been a firearms instructor and I’ve seen that not everyone should learn to use a firearm. Some people absolutely need limits on the information given to them… but that’s not my choice to make! That’s not my judgement to deal out.  I got into teaching gun safety to help people, get rid of some of the fear and stigma and answer questions honestly for people… but I definitely met a few people asking some very uncomfortable questions and it gave me pause about whether to even answer or not.. When some sketchy dude keeps asking about firearm registration, how many serial numbers they have and other very suspicious crap I ask myself… is this an info hazard situation? Is this information too dangerous to share in this situation? I don’t know.   Like all big questions… it’s big. It’s complicated and I just take it case by case, use my best judgment and I try to trust in humanity as best I can.
I had an idea for a short story involving these topics, and this has inspired me to finish writing it.  In short, it’s a story of a near future where bioengineering is the new normal, and race and ethnicity are much less of a factor anymore because people can just choose what features their babies will have, and get a basic “wellness” package that basically gives them genes for improved immunity, learning, intelligence, health… etc. so basically everyone is some version of “perfect” and mixed up, whatever skin tones, hair colors and types, eye color, and even more specific details can be adjusted..  A few generations in and everything seems to be great, the first two generations with enhanced abilities and intellect have already made improvements to technology and innovation, more mentally stable and healthy people in positions of power have made better decisions and put a huge dent in global warming and major world issues… Everything seems great… just great.  Until you zoom out a bit…   Just like our world where modern innovations like refrigeration, internet and medicine have lead to prosperity and comfort where even poor people and prisoners have smartphones and access to all of the world’s knowledge…  Those things only go so far and people are still dying of easily treatable diseases, lack of clean water, and no options for escape from their suffering… the comfort we live in is a bubble and we ignore those outside of it because they don’t affect our daily lives..   The same is true in this future world of “perfect humans” and “equality”.. those who refuse or cannot afford genetic enhancements for their children are treated as lesser, and billions still live in poverty and although the 3rd world nations have caught up a bit and things like illness and water access are much less of an issue, the gap still exists and continues to grow between those who are “perfect” and those who “are not”.   So, a terrorist group that is funded and comprised of people with objections to gene editing grows and one day… it happens.  A sickness spreads across the globe and the “perfect” people are so self centered that they fail to even notice that only they are getting sick. Only they are dying. The few billion people with natural human genes are all untouched by this pandemic of targeted death.  It soon becomes clear that this was an attack and even with their heightened immunity and peak health, around 85-90% of the edited humans are dead within the year. The world falls into absolute chaos as most of the power structure and money is in the control of dead people… but the infrastructure that keeps society going is fine… the working class and poor who keep the lights on, the toilets flushing, and grow the food… the ones who couldn’t afford expensive gene editing… those people survived.   In the coming years as the world adjusts and goes through wars, turmoil and rebuilding, the truth comes out. The pandemic was a bio weapon designed to target and attack the genetic tags used to edit the genes. The virus found the remnants of the gene markers used to make those people “perfect” and it made it their biggest flaw… and then it exploited that flaw by eating away at their genes.  The short story ends without a true resolution because that’s how life works.  Many ideas are raised and discussed, like making gene editing a free option for everyone, making gene editing illegal or even making it mandatory.  The world never comes to a conclusion and continues to stumble forward, trying to recover from the loss of 20-25% of the population of the world. (This is a slightly higher percentage of the real life percentage of “upper middle class” and up worldwide and was based on how common I believed the editing to be. Basically if you can afford a decent college for your kids, vacations and a recreational vehicle like a boat or something… you can afford at least basic editing. Extreme editing costs much more.)  I never really fleshed it out, I had a few more ideas and I’m excited to actually write more about it. Actually write a few more characters and make a sort of World War Z style anthology of stories… but much shorter.  Anyway, I just figured I’d share in case anyone cares. If not… that’s cool too. It’s so easy for us to hate the 1% the gap that exists between us, that we forget that the same size gap exists below us except the difference is that we’re jealous of mansions and wealth, and the people below us are jealous of clean water, safety, food security, basic medical care… etc. all of the things we take for granted make us look like 1% assholes to billions of people worldwide. When we look at spoiled rich kids crying about getting the wrong Mercedes for her birthday, some family feels the same way about us pouring fresh water on our lawn while they get parasites from water they walked ten miles to get.  That’s something I wanted to address in the story, that progress doesn’t lift all boats equally and we shouldn’t get so caught up chasing the 1% that we forget the people who are chasing us. We need to work harder to make sure that EVERYONE benefits from innovation and growth.
3:50 the umbrella corps badge gave me a bit of a flashback to "7 minutes. 7 minutes is all I can spare to play with you."
4:46 new batshit virus LMAO give animator a raise
Read the book upgrade by Blake Crouch! Puts genetic modifications and distribution into an amazing novel
And still no cure to cancern
That Open Philantropy disclaimer at the beginning is nice. In case there's still somebody slow enough not to recognize such an obvious piece of regime propaganda, they just go an tell you directly. Beautiful.
If genetic engineering gets even cheaper in the next few decades, I am unironically gonna try and make a Pokemon. Obviously it wouldn’t be able to use moves or evolve or anything, but imma make something that looks exactly like, for example, an eevee. And sell it as a pet.
I know it is serious but DR BOMBASTIC 6:41 if you know you know
As some in biotech I can say it's not the easy
4:46 Look under the Purple book, you can see BATSH*T word
"Accidental leak" lol
"Vaccine"
Pretty sad to see kurzgesagt is still on the government payroll. Where is this supposed 'pandemic' ?? you mean the 'virus' that mutated like 10 times then stopped conveniently when government said so lol Pathetic channel spreading lies
Let's just hope someone out there named William Birkin isn't working on a virus called T-Virus
If someone sneezed on me like that person did in the video, you can bet your life we are absolutely throwing hands!
@3:50 "I understood that reference"
i've been infected with covid-19 3 times with only 2 vaccines
Oh shit those gay furry hackers that hacked that nuclear lab... I understand what they're doing now    They're dropping a bomb that turns everyone into catboys
>still subject to scientific debate >5 months ago  just... lol

do we trust CHINA!?!?!
korean subtitles
All this progress and people still think we shouldn't be whatever gender we want to be smh
Why use a bio nuke when they can just release covid on us 😂
denmark when this happens:atvateing sheld ok now we are ok oh fuck somon from socan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8:29 thats what i dream of as a transhumanist, mastery of bio technology freeing mankind from the limitations of our genes, a future where every person gets to choose exactly who they are inside and out, more free than ever before. and hopefuly a more empethetic humanity that shares that higher level of existence with other species in the form of uplifting.
Loved the Umbrella Corp reference. 🧟‍♂
Thankfully, our eastern European education system doesn't teach ten years old chemistry and biology in highschools, but more like a hundred years old version instead, so noone can blame me for the next plague ig  Now seriously, the poor level of education here is just a terrible idea and I can't imagine even a single person (in case he's interested into biology or chemistry) that had finished a highschool here and would argue against learning new technology in highschools.
it means nuke
what dose nuclear mean
I Was 4 or5 in the pandemic im not sure  pandemic was in 2020 2020 was 3 and 11  months and 3 day ago
I remembwr one youtube channel who make fun of bio technology and created a lab grown living brain cells and it ler play doom..
Too late for that, the knowledge of how to make deadly viruses is already in the hands of millions of people. Which means it's uncontainable.
Something still unthinkable. I'm glad "both sides" have at last agreed, both in media and on the ground, that that was done too quickly and is now causing dangers.
If it's bio-nuclear it's still nuclear, even if it's less so
"Don't tell him, Pike!!"
ITS TRUMP
3:50 nice reference
"new batshit virus discovered" lol what
Not even kind of up for debate. China created the virus to get rid of their elderly and immune compromised (government dependent) to make way for a new generation of tax payers. That’s why amidst all of this they went to a 3 child policy.
sorry if anyone was rude to you about the funny poster initially.. i personally would love evrything put out by kurzgesagt.. if only i could afford them, but once im getting enough money ill definitely buy something to support this channel and all the birbs responsible for it!
You guys are the best, Thank YOU. :)
This ain't fair Got my interests and future plan slapped into biology with a single video  What the hell
I LOVE YOUR MUSIC TEAM, soundtrack is amazing every time!
It's quite incredible how God made us in his image to share in his glory and creation.  Unfortunately due to our sin we obtained the knowledge of good and evil and are quite capable doing doing things that could bless or curse the world.  The fact that we can do the great marvels we do shows how misled these 'experts' are on this crazy idea of evolution.  It's quite obvious that we are way out of every other living thing's league!
I Was unlucky Being 9 years. I was domed. To be infected cause my entire grade entire family about 87% infected. When I was infected I was sick for 2 days. But almost needed to go to the hospital until I finally could move!
This is a dangerous video. You're getting close to a topic that will spawn an idea, which once released to the public, will eventually kill us all assuming we haven't left earth by then. I strongly recommend you stay away from this topic in order to minimize the chances of someone eventually working out this idea. The human race needs to buy as much time as we possibly can.
All fake. Another stock/sharemarket income legal fraud scheme. All the while we continue to freely drink poisonous alcohol and inhale cancerous tobacco and others, not to mention lust for noxious toxin cities and open disgusting disregard for the natural world. Go and rethink your life you delusional hypocrites.
We need to leave stuff like this alone or we will all die
Is Kurzgesagt advocating for Scientific Censorship?
When  Kurzgesagt starts to talk about Big Pharma, it's time to take it with a grain of salt.
Mmmm covid 23 from my parents garage
So you're tellin me I gotta buy a shit load of samples to store before they start tracking😈
"New bats**t virus discovered" 4:46
Do a video about prions
I hate biotech people. We gotten into covid cause of their recklessness.
10:20 you're welcome😂
But the background music is soooo good
i belive bioteck is stunted an mal nurished. it is waaaay behinde other sciences. so the adolecent rebuilding an iphone is more like an adolecent rebuilding an FM radio. there is litle but artificial selection on the field right now, even caspr researsh is mostly manual trial and error, so basicaly alquemy in its worst way.
As can be seen from the case of China, the reality is Bio weapons cannot be controlled.   Optimistic animation and reality are different.   and Are we safe from nuclear weapons? at all..
This sounds like a story plot of a zombie outbreak
The virus leaked, there is evidence of human manipulation.
Thanks for reminding me why I don't watch this silly naive channel
I LIKED MY COMMENT (:
NileRed: and I took it seriously...
YOOO as a lifelong Resident Evil fan, I see and love the easter egg you guys dropped at 3:50!
Birds.
If we allow genetic information of viruses to not be publicized, it’s likely to enable other generic information, like gene therapy targets, to be patented by companies looking to make a profit, and they could take away our ability to have ownership/privacy over our own personal genetic information so they can use our data to make a profit
Have you done anything on authoritarianism? It’s a real threat globally,especially in the US. People need to understand what a threat it is to democracy and actual liberty. Great work as usual. :)
don't do fake stuff else we will be mad
Can’t believe I have never seen this channel before 🤔  It’s very interesting I love it that much I have subscribed.   I just had covid to never thought after 3 years and half years it would get me , I’ve learned so much about viruses and radiation from you guys the past week 💯✔️🙂
Journal names, ha ha. Monty Python
4:45 on the 3 book it says "New Batshit  discoverd"
Im bout to make a virus out break
Lmao and we all know how those Covid vaccines turned out 😂
Amazing how many biologist commenting don’t know you can create Anthrax at home! 🤦‍♂️
Now my younger brother has a use for his useless existence                  A TEST SUBJECT
So you want more government intervention and tracking? No way.
Scientists literally mergeing viruses 😂
Covid is the first example. When was the first strain of it devised, what cued the release, when did the 'inhibitors' get bought, when did the promotion via flux start... No way to know now.
Definitely lost respect for refusing to say Wuhan even now
7:26
Honestly the Government needs to watch kurzgesagt atp
IIRC the reason we had a covid vaccine so quickly was because it WASN'T a new or unknown virus. We had experienced and made vaccines for SARS variants before, and covid was similar enough that they knew where to start. We are experiencing the growing pains of the information age and the development of medical science along with it, but we are only barely starting to understand the human body and brain, it will be some decades (minimum) before we have the technology to truly "control" our biology. The Able bodied among you may feel we are already there, but any disabled or chronically ill person is very well aware of the remaining limitations of modern medicine.
terrorists watching this 👀👀
Love Kurzgesart
3:16 hehe
there is no money for the higher ups by helping one another
Had a look at the sources. Seems Esvelt (2022) is the only source that actually talks about the scary conclusions this whole video connects to the progress of bioengineering. The government report on discussions between scientists and the security sector are just that: discussions. I'm going to follow up on the Esvelt report to see the criticisms on that. I urge everyone to do the same. Please share your findings here. Good to see much skepticism in the comments!
Imagine a really infectious virus that only kills cancer. That would be a great investment in science.
Ah the dichotomy of human existence.  On one hand, an actual working, viable, scalable cure for cancer is within sight with the emergency introduction of mRNA vaccines into mainstream use.  On the other we have to spend money trying to prevent people from drinking bleach.
even if its regulated enough so that were 100% sure what your editing or doing cannot effect humans directly no virus or bacteria can get transmitted to humans and your not editing humans directly the last thing you want is  there once was a man from Nantucket  he put some mice in a bucket AND NOW ALL THE SEAGULLS ARE DEAD or oh no why is this insect not toxic to all of its predators and just survives all attempts and being eating and has taken over an entire ecosystem killing everything in its path? quite devastating to humans even if none of that effects humans directly no? either way once species killing off another this way is wrong right? even if no ecosystem collapse?
Not to mention getting the vaccine so soon was partially because scientists were already researching vaccines for similar diseases when the pandemic started.
7:25
Ahh yes the government should be the only one to have virus blueprints, sure this would be fine
The one main thing I will commend inanutshell on is that they acknowledge the lab leak hypothesis, which is often derided as a conspiracy theory, or morphed into the “COVID bioweapon “ conspiracy theory
Hi there! I'm a biochemist and bioinformatician, and I think it's important to mention that regulation of biotechnology at this point is basically impossible. With the advent of absurdly cheap lab equipment made in China that anyone can order - in many cases right on Amazon - you're not going to stop anyone who wants to play with fire. Considering this, it's my professional opinion that we should prioritize preparation and development of tools to react quickly and efficiently to new threats. Perhaps the best way to do this is to simplify the mRNA vaccine development process and decrease the regulatory hurdles that delay these critical tools in an emergency.
Always wear a mask when you are out. Everything we know about viruses from decades of study shows, N95 or higher masks are the primarily line of defense.
Lab leak theory is a hack and had no place being mentioned seriously in a video like this
covid was made in a lab the US government admitted it.
Problem is here on earth,  everytime a scientist makes a break through discovery that maybe very useless to humankind, the military come straight in and looks to turn it into a deadly weapon before anything pleasant can be done with it... With so many dark and dangerous souls running countries all over the world,  biotech labs don't fill me with much confidence
My le virus.. le killed people?
What's more possible some guy at a wet market eating a bat or people that do this for a living accidentally leaking a virus ?
Nice video
🫂
6:41 Dr. Bombastic's bomb tutorial huh? Why is that so familliar?...
2:52 Why is she playing a guitar with a flask?
not really a conspiracy theorist but there was a chinese couple who worked in one of canada's highest security infectious disease labs who were expelled along with every one of their students early in the pandemic.  where did the husband recently travel to before this?  the top security level infectious disease lab in wuhan.  What are the chances that a) a new disease emerges in the same city one these rare labs is also located b) shipments of various deadly viruses were sent to this lab months prior to outbreak from scientists in another country with ties to this lab.  Sketchy as hell.  They got fired but we have a real problem with technology being stolen by the plethora of chinese grad students here.  Had it happen at my old job with a guy i had gone to school with.  (not that I'm saying all chinese are bad.  But god damn, they even had police stations here keeping tabs on people and even at the U of Toronto, when a tibetan student became students union president there was a ton of online harassment to the effect of "we have to control the rebels" and batshit insane stuff like that.  There is a real impunity about it all from my own experience)
A 10 month vaccine is still unthinkable today.
Plague Inc players rn: 😈
Most dangerous weapon today is islam, it convert normal man to became zombie, a normal women to a black tent
i assume bionuclear is like a nuke but instead of uranium use like. a horse
4:45 bats%%t virus💀
they'll be searching on the internet if they do.. and before it happend the Feds already show up (i hope)
Not fond of this video at all. Sensationalist and seeks to push an agenda rather than inform. Viruses are notoriously difficult to work with. The idea that some high schooler is doing it with spare parts in his garage is absurd.
7:26 hehehehehhehehehehehe
Indeed.  They are correct again.
There is no evidence it came from nature, all kinds of evidence it came form the wuhan lab !
"What if we made a nuclear bomb in our backyard" Sounds like the quiet kid who is capable of doing it.
even though i have the information, i wouldnt do anything. im to lazy
>open philantropy OPINION discarded
The scary part is,  When it is cheap and easy enough to the point that some crazy people can quickly release more and more deadly bioweapons to the world,  (or people who do it by chance just because they think this kind of danger is no way to occur  or don't know how to handle it safely or don't even care about it)   No matter what cause, after spreads,  it continues to mutate and has many chances to evolve to kill millions or even billions of people around the world.  (of course directly and indirectly)  I think it no point in debating how hard it is to make,  or how low the rate of these occurs, as long as a single success/mistake can continue to kill our family for decades or centuries.  For me, I think we should treat it like this kind of thing can happen in the near future and prepare the countermeasure  as shown in the video,   a detection system that does not break down because of a lag of funds from some governments who do not realize this problem. (Not just 1 country though)  a better countermeasure when a new pandemic starts. (Research better technology also needs time, money, and other support)  a decent control without dragging good people too much to make their technology far behind that cannot counter whatever is inside the new Bio-Pandora's box of bad people who don't care about the law or even human life, will one day open it for sure.
biohackers are a fascinating bunch. They're the ones seriously pushing the future of our biological and genetic engineering. It's also relatively accessible to anyone who's willing to learn from online sources. One of the biggest factors is that some biohackers are willing to test new and advanced techniques and genetic experiments on their own DNA. It could be super dangerous, but the results could be massively influential for the future of the sciences. Like the Chinese doctor who gene edited twins and while doing it gave them a genetic immunity to HIV. nobody was willing or allowed to do that, but since he took that dangerous step and the results went well. In fact there were additional benefits nobody anticipated. Since that went so well, we are now able and willing to do other genetic edits to help people. Like the a study helping cure peoples blindness using CRISPR in the United States. I'm hoping we can be safe and smart about it to usher in a new age of genetic modifications. Unfortunately I think it's also inevitable we're going to make mistakes, or a bad actor will cause something horrible. We need to get on top of it ASAP.
Covid came from a lab
People will still refuse to wear masks mostly Americans saying you can’t restrict me! Or something dumb but in all seriousness America fails here as they charge you so much it’s essentially your life savings for a simple hospital visit or getting transported in an ambulance
Vaccines caused more deaths from side effects like myocarditis than saved people from covid.

I have a question. That english is british?
Whenever I watch these videos I can't help but imagine aliens watching this 30 years later
I saw that umbrella corp logo you smoothly animated in there…
EVERYBODY SPAM THX IN THE COMMENTS
this is made in history many many times from same tribe there says they are jew but isnt,there say they are christian but isnt and so on in history.they made the animals they spread rhis with
The only issue is with the malware vaccine was it was rushed out with very little testing and control because of the panic. Now many are showing adverse affects that appear to have connections to the vaccines. Vaccines usually take years to finally be approved and distributed. Mainly because long term testing needs to be done to look for potential side effects and gauge the risk rates. As for the "scientific debate" about the origins of the malware - it has several genetic markers that are not seen in nature. More and more scientists have come out stating they were pressured to not discuss the origins of it. It's just fact. I follow actual science and actual data, not the politician and media twists to suit their own agendas. The malware virus in its original form has been known about and studied since the 80's. It's genetic makeup is extremely similar to... Wait for it.... Influenza.  Bat's don't fly around biting people. They only bite if you get too close to be bitten or scratched and they're in fear for their life. The bat soup theory was bs because viruses cannot live in the temperatures the bat's are cooked in (which I recommend you watch a video or two of how bat soup is made. It's disturbing and cruel.)
Selpultura - Biotechnology   “BIOTECH IS GODZILLA!” 🤘🏽
Folks, Let's Just agree right now... LETS NOT do the unthinkable... Don't “play with fire”
Biotech student here. I will never grow tired of this quote by Richard Feynman in "The Meaning of it All: Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist":  <<Once in Hawaii I was taken to see a Buddhist temple. In the temple a man said, "I am going to tell you something that you will never forget." And then he said, "To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven. The same key opens the gates of hell."   And so it is with science. [...]>>

I don't always agree, not so much the science stuff that is, but I love this channel so much.
our india is not doing that virus  thinge 7:18 😁
hmmm umbrella crop 3:49 🤔🤣
I do computational work in modern biotech. Most of the discussion and solutions in this video are nonsense. Controlling the spread of information about viral DNA? This is a silly proposition and has nothing in common with how nuclear weapon technology is controlled (which just delays, not prevents e g rogue states building it). It also seems completely ignorant about eg Biosafety levels in the US. A potentially bigger risk in the field is the fact that machine learning based optimizations are an unknown frontier. There are many papers demonstrating how algorithmic learning can produce novel poisons from chemical data, harmful viral mutations from DNA data and protein folding advances, etc.
scientist:i found a new virus  me:CAN YOU STOP TRYING TO FIND THINGS THAT CAN KILL US
Slight problem with making viruses go nearly extinct and that is that if we do over time our immune system will devolve to the point that if a deadly disease somehow mutates and gets through our non natural defenses we will stand no hope of survival if we get infected and then we have a Covid incident but it will last longer and kill at a way faster pace and then if we become a multi planet species we could have to worry about completely clearing the planet before inhabiting it as our immune systems will be essentially useless and then if viruses from planets with different strands show up we could be done as it could hide easily and be able to spread across planets it just seems like a bad idea to not just find medicine that supports our immune system while not making it useless and then the body thinking it doesn’t need it and then we lose it I get that it’s more complicated that that but eventually it could happen so I think we shouldn’t be messing with bio technology past a certain point
Thanks to Kurzgesagt, I wanna become a scientist when I grow up, I'm 11 years old! Thank you Kurzgesagt, most people in my class think I know everything, all thanks to you, keep up the good work!😁

Viruses protect us from alien invasion.
I always imagined a nasal implant or tracheal implant that uses ultraviolet light to burn away virus and micro bacterial invaders
It's your capitalist propaganda that is the worst enemy for humanity!

Everyone is gangsta until Kurzgesagt says, "Crappy."
I have an idea
Yep, the original "quack" is here ! Thank you for bringing that "quack" back ❤😊
Please sir  Put English subtitles in the video Because I'm Indian it is difficult to understand.
Rabies!
Covid clearly came from a lab in China funded by the US. Interesting video though.
Delusional video. Bio technological advancements will do nothing but harm to civilisation
Dear creators and teams from Kurzgesagt,  I hope this comment finds you well. I am writing to express my immense admiration for your incredible YouTube channel and the wealth of knowledge and inspiration it provides. Your captivating videos have not only broadened my understanding of the universe but have also sparked a desire within me to improve myself and cultivate positive habits.  I must confess that I have been struggling with developing and maintaining habits in my life. Despite my best efforts, I often find myself lacking the discipline and consistency required to make lasting changes. It is at this point that I turn to you, not only as a source of information but also as a beacon of motivation.  I have seen about your habit journal and the positive impact it has had on many individuals. It would mean the world to me if you could extend your generosity and help me by sharing your habit journal with me. I believe that your journal could serve as a powerful tool to guide me in my journey towards self-improvement.  Your insights and expertise in understanding human behavior and the science behind habit formation would be invaluable to me. I am confident that with your guidance, I can overcome my struggles and develop the habits necessary to lead a more fulfilling and productive life.  I understand that you receive countless requests and messages from your dedicated fans, and I truly appreciate the time and consideration you put into each one. Should you decide to grant my humble request, I promise to make the utmost use of your habit journal, documenting my progress and applying the knowledge you have shared.

I would have loved to buy it and suppor what you are doing, but my living condition doesn't allow me to do so. Warm regards,  Your fan from Ethiopia Gera
Nature is not a country. Reasoning by analogy is a huge mistake. Biotech can escape beyond all controls. Nuclear was much more controllable.
7:26 Kurzgesagt just said among us
Your channel always excites me with how you care for attention to details, fact checking and so many other aspects. Hoo, love it. Absolutely love it.
Kurzgesagt making a video about ways on how to possibly destroy the world   Edit:no offense i just find his vids intresting and sometimes funny
(R Heissler)
They probably have read  How man dies? & how do we escape?
What a load of Crap!
Complete bullshit.  But you got your Gates Foundation money.🤑
Congratulations for successfully selling out to Dustin Moskovitz and Bill Gates to produce their well-funded pseudoscientific propaganda.
What Is the Difference Between God and Nature?  “It is best for us to agree and accept the words of the Kabbalists that ‘the nature’ (Heb. ‘HaTeva’ [‘הטבע’]) has the same numerical value as ‘God’ (Heb. ‘Elohim’ [‘אלהים’]—eighty-six. Then, I will be able to call the laws of God ‘nature’s commandments [Mitzvot],’ or vice-versa (God’s commandments [Mitzvot] by the name ‘nature’s laws’), for they are one and the same.” – Kabbalist Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam), “The Peace.”  There is nothing besides the system of nature, which Kabbalists equally refer to as “nature” or “God,” and we are integral parts of this system.  Therefore, when we say that there is one God, it means that there is nothing besides one force acting in this single system we are parts of.  The desire of the single force acting in reality is to bring us into connection with it—not via coercion, but through awareness in a positive manner.  As much as we understand, feel and attain this force as one that is good and benevolent, then we can adhere to it and reach its level of complete awareness.
7:26 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH AMONG US AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH YOU MUST LAUGH NOW AHAHAHAHAHAHAH
I just realized that kurzgesagt is kindaaaa obsessed with bananas
Kurzgesagt said a bad word 😱
Humans is create more diseases than cures there I said it
We should ban bio scientist from playing plague inc, so they don't get any funny ideas😂
Worked in a microbiology lab for over 10 years and it amazes me how little we're regulated. Worked with some highly dangerous bacteria/parasites/pathogens and it's just a lazy intern away from an infectious outbreak. Surprised the Covid one took so long to happen
This is a very .... interesting video.
Fear mongering BS- education and availability of information is all the separates our world from a dystopia like Huxley’s Brave New World. Anyone who wants to do something terrible can, and that’s just a consequence of freedom- the alternative is not worth discussing.
So what is next? Marburg virus or new covid variant? Maybe with higher letality rates? Every crisis is a good money making opportunities, and goverments will not waste them. Rather will recreate a few more
Nuclear energy is the most heavily regulated industry in the world, very much due to its birth from weapons programs of WWII as pointed out in this video. Now is the time to regulate the biotechnology industry while also ensuring that developing countries have equitable access to the same knowledge and resources to build and maintain their health care systems. We have the IAEA for peaceful use of nuclear energy, along with other equivalent bodies in many nations. I guess we have the WHO and then CDC and other national bodies. But something like an international biotechnology infohazard agency (IBIA?) might be in order?
The phrase "shared freely" should not be applied to anything for which a price must be paid.
I'm gonna be honest, I'm annoyed at how many people dislike this video and do not get at all what the problem is. Kurzgesagt has made tons of videos less about explaining hard science and more about promoting safe changes and educating not just on facts but rather on the course of measure needed to be taken. I see nothing different in this video. Kurzgesagt explains some basics about development in the field of biology, why those developments could prove dangerous, and how to stop that danger early.
Классный канал, от подачи не устаёшь
Or we can stop making viruses that destroy humanity
OMG those journal titles at around 4:40! 😂
Anyone got a bunker I can stay in
just an idea can you make a second channel with creation viewing and new fact... just a thought...
Any1 else see teh "batshit virus returns" book at 4:46

DR BOMBASTIC
When I get told i shouldn't have taken the vaccine I always think of the pints of an infusion of made from mouse protein that stopped me dying from an auto-immune disorder that gave you an average life span of 5 months. A treatment came from Dr Fauci back in the 70s that stopped people from dying.
I love this series, so helpful, keep it going neeb!
Can't call experimental drug a vaccine 🤷‍♂️
Great video Kurzgesagt :]
7:26 among us confirmed
Un jabbed and healthy id hate to get jabbed then have complications no offence but fuck everyone else 😂
To understand more about bio weapons? You need to watch some movies or episodes about people who uses deadly diseases to cause outbreaks that can kill off entire populations(or even species) to extinction, The best example is the blue shadow virus from lego Star Wars the clone wars.
The topic of information hazard would deserve a video on its own
Greetings! I’m a biotechnology engineering and I want to say this is one of the best videos regarding this topic I’ve ever seen. For even if most of us want to us the general knowledge to make “the world better” there’s still people who want to use it for other reasons to cause harm. And the fact the accessibility of information has increased it can be harmful if not controlled.
COVID-19 isnt a debate about the origin, was nature, only idiots believe that originate from a chinese lab, in fact several inspector e almost all investigators from WHO says that was natural, only some nothing neutral american investigador says "we cannot say that is not originated from a lab", basically saying they need a negative prove, they cannot say the origin, so still a possibility a mad teory, anyone with 3 neurons know thats is just politicying the virus into the new cold war EUA vs China.
“Stay at home” really worked at all?
While gene editing is certainly more affordable and easier to conduct, I am very skeptical of the scale claimed about weaponizing viruses by non-state actors. I also find the 3x key points for achieving safety and security reasonable, so long as the public use and availability of the technology is ensured (excluding viruses).
stop scarring people ! reminded me of natzi  ideologies
3:14 Hmmm.... I sure do wonder what if I could build a nuke in my backyard...
The technological singularity approaches.
scource for making this video was cnn ? 😅 gtfo with this wet market bs. Also gain of function is illegal, fotgot to mention that
Hey Kurz get your $h!t together not a good look for you pushing out conspiracy and bribed propaganda
This is a double edged sword, I really think we should invest in strengthening our immune systems by any means, even by micro exposure...way safer than gambling on filters and chemicals to eradicate an uncountably numerous enemy that can change in a moments notice, leaving our immune systems to degenerate by inactivity leaving us ever more susceptible to infection.
Thanos was right.
Daily reminder that Norman Borlaug saved a billion people.
Shit, didn't realise Fauci was a financier for kurzgesagt.
As someone who has worked with an actual virus for completing a 6-month dissertation project, I had to sign around 7 different forms stating that I know what I'm gonna do at the lab, the kind of reagents I'm most likely gonna use, the people I'm gonna work with, the type of microbe that will be studied, and so on. Also, I was given limited lab access where the card only worked for 12 hours as I was doing my Masters and there was 24x7 CCTV surveillance. On top of all that, we all followed a strict protocol in sorting and disposing of any kind of lab waste we generated. So yeah, everyone kinda knew what I was upto from start to finish, and we did everything safely and cautiously.  The idea that people could easily make a deadly world-ending microbe at home in the distant future is rather daft because it is very difficult, risky, and expensive to get your hands on even some of the most basic equipment, enzymes, and even a perfectly harmless microbe.   Kurzgesagt, I do love your videos, but please be careful when talking about anything related to making a home-made bioweapon as it perpetuates the false idea that scientists are out there creating pandemics for the fun of it, and I mean this as a microbiologist.
7:26
Anyone else make the waaa noise when you hear it or just me
We know exactly where it came from fauci admitted to having labs testing it I'm America and China it's was a joint fuck up
Before saying that humans have been able to manage  nuclear energy, lets firs remember Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Breaking news: Florida Man creates a rabies superbug resistant to vaccines in backyard spreadable not just by infected animal but by air

Who's the  doingmaking virus virus virus
Ok so humans are nuclear radio made of inside
This video is not it. The sensationalism around covid. The "facts" that skirt the line between fact and fiction. There is already so much mustrust and misunderstanding with science this is not actually helping at all. I'd argue this video is more harmful honestly. I'm disappointed.
ah sweet, man made horrors beyond human comprehension
Websites for finding dna/pathogens to buy (dw im broke cant buy anything)
The world will end in the next 15-20 years.
This video is central-biased: it mentions only the downsides of bioinfrastructure distribution. Just as a nuclear garage threat can be generated, so can a nuclear garage hope.
Info hazards do not exist. Open information is how we stop manmade pandemics, not sealing this information away.  Open Philanthropy is owned by George Soros.  Interpret that how you will.
Whatever happens, I'm not taking another vaccine
We do a little bit of trolling
Classic garbage tier fearmongering video in line with channel content "quality".  Yes, GMO technology enables creation of viruses.  More importantly it allows fundamental changes in human biochemistry.  Viruses work by hijacking said biochemistry - when its not shared among people, its impossible to create a pandemic. As then what makes one person ill will do diddle allcto the person next to them.
5:05 the switch controllers yooo😂
Evidence for it being lab-made is undisputable.  There are no bat colonies in Wuhan China. Also, something like Covid is going to happen. Not because EVIL people want to kill people no.  Because of the stupidity and shortsightedness of people with good intentions, the next pandemic will occur just like covid did. People who made the COVID-19 virus did it to study viruses to prepare us for a pandemic. ( we meet our fate in the way we go to avoid it.)
Yeah maybe walling off scientific knowledge is a bad idea??? It's no secret how nuclear bombs work, the problem is that the equipment you need to create the depleted uranium/plutonium is large and expensive. Not everyone can do it. People have tried.
if you pause at 4:46 and see the book on top, it says "NEW BATSHIT VIRUS DISCOVERED"
HUGE audience with few videos? Check.   Clearly got a budget?  Check.   Constantly pushed by the faux YT algorithm? Check.  Being proposed as an "authoritative" source?  CHECK.  Propaganda:  YEP.  CHECK.
Covid genom already on the global market years before the pandemic! Stop telling people lies! Thank you!
i am your duck
Glad that this is seen as a threat, saw a yt vid about someone essentially making a rats brain cells play pong.  Felt kinda wacky when I grew up when cloning a sheep was a breakthrough
pffff taet
Covid vaccine 2 weeks, HIV vaccine takes forever. Follow the money trail. 😂
Can’t wait the for plot of Tom Clangy’s The Division to become real :)
The info restriction is borderline impossible at this point, and its going to take some d*ckbag actually successfully weaponizing it with many dead for anyone to care enough to make the changes possible. Its not a how, its a when situation.
AMONG US 7:26
Mutating Virus: Wuhan, China in the corner working with CoVid3.0
Unknown cov virus? Bs. China had it in its deleted database.
We can't control shit, our knowledge from science is simplified reality. When we create technology with our simplified knowledge, it fuc*s things up and causes unintended consequences. Why don't you talk about complex systems, rather than being unrealistic and techno-optimist? Ohhhh, because you wouldn't get as much attention from dumb viewers. That's why your content can be incredibly biased and misleading. A shame, as some of your content is great.  Technology, when viewed on the macro, hasn't been beneficial at all. It's increased the anthropocentric human population and has destroyed everything, which will include humans.
I don't think nuclear safety can be considered a success yet, or for centuries or millenia to come. The decades that have passed since its invention aren't even a drop in the bucket of evolutionary time. Yet, we already have more and more states like Israel, North Korea and South Asian countries getting their hands on it, often against international consensus. With explosion of terrorists like ISIS and American white nationalists, we don't know yet if in our lifetime nuclear weapons may fall into the wrong hands. We already have countries like Putin's Russian using them to kill off political enemies.
Kurzgesagt gained even more respect by owning their mistake. Great work as always.
This is pretty clear propaganda :/
I wonder if destroying _all_ microorganisms like with the nanofilter could be detrimental to us in the long run. Will our immune systems start to grow complacent and forget how to fight basic microorganisms? Or am I just being an absolute moron here? Anybody care to educate me on this?
Wolmf >>> pug
I wonder how much better the world would be if we could have scientists in government.
Makes a video about how dangerous bionuclear weapon can be..  -proceeds to tell it’s available online easily
The bias in this channel is undeniable at this point, very disappointing and offensive.
Tldr, don't summon nurgel, its not gona end well for anyone
UV lamps could cause cancer. Those are basically tanning salon lights, except not as powerful.
We need to study stupidity first.  Stupidity is the single most dangerous disease that can destroy human civilization.
You need to make a video about collective stupidity. Ants walking on circles will walk until they die. Humans can also destroy themselves.
If Yellowstone explodes, it will be a mess...  In 2008 a study discovered that there is a deformation near a fault. We were told that we should be concerned with magnitude 2+ and we are already 3+.  In august 2022, it started to produce frequencies between 1 and 10 hertz. It happens before and during eruptions.  People, we are on borrowed time.  There is a 100km superficial magma filled with hyperexplosive rhyolite. If it goes off in a big explosion, life within 500 km will be gone, and within 1000km it will struggle to survive. Earthquakes will propagate to east coast, and ash cloud will be in the east. If it activates Cascadia and San Andres, the west economy is gone.  Canada and USA would be disaster zones.
In the past years many people with power did things just because they can. I suspect that the next 2 decades we will witness the era of backfirings.
They should have put Chinese flag on the intro
nice fiction channel
There is NO DEBATE where the Beer Bug came from. It's been conclusively proved to be a bioengineered virus created at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China
Ya ima ignore the covid part we all know that was man made
zombie t virus just lurking in my garage now lol
I feel that nowadays its the people with bad intentions that control these things or at the very least we are on the way to that.
they should make mewtwo
dude just made a vid about how dangerous nuclear power is, kinda giving off fearmongering ngl
Seeing the Umbrella Corp at 3:50 and the possible T virus after it got me more interested in Bio Science and medical history
there were news about wu-han virologists being among the first (if not the first) victims of the new corona virus. I'm pretty sure that the whole bat - armadillo - giraffe - bonobo bs is just spin.
With the way that humans act towards each other now and in the past I seriously fear for a future where anyone can control biology completely. That future looks absolutely terrifying.
2:19 i swear theres an incomplete swastika on the bottom left
Similarly to how you're almost automatically put on the terrorist watchlist if you try to buy plutonium, the biological equivalent of crimes against humanities should be similarly guarded and secured
Yea this missed the mark guys…. Wild claims with no source material… this isn’t normal for you guys what’s going on
Scientific debate when you have physical evidence of Covid originating at Wuhan labs in 2014
I think everyone making a big deal about this video having an “anti freedom if information” tilt needs to grow up. Everything said in this video is perfectly sensible. Some of y’all thinking it’s just kosher to freely spread information about civilization-ending viruses really need to readjust your priorities in life.
1:03 Do ya’ll realise how damn *INSANE* that is!? The very first COVID-19 vaccines were developed mere *months* after the pandemic started!! And as the Narrator states, it was *IMPOSSIBLE* only a decade ago. That is only TEN YEARS  Good lord humanity is incredible
"YOU SHOULD BE TRACKED"  Yeah, i expected more from a channel such as this. You should be ashamed of yourself...
transhumanists and biohackers gang hehe.
Bro teaching us how to make viruses🦠
Just in time for the supposed lockdowns part deux we are going to experience this fall
UMBRELLA Nice Easter egg 3:50
making a nuclear bomb in my back yard..? Hm not a bad a idea, not a bad idea at all.
I loved the Umbrella Corporation references.
Umbrella 😮
I love you kurzgesagt
Not surprising that organizations like Kurzgesagt, who are close to foundations, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation would lobby for government regulation and tracking when it comes to biotechnology. Why should anyone get any chance to do anything themselves, why should there be any opportunity, economical or in healthcare, when it can easily be monopolized by people like Gates, who then go on to fund reckless GMO programs for insects and plants in Africa, who try to copyright genes and influence governments? Fear-mongering like this is absolutely reckless, just completely irresponsible.
Ah, yes. Kurzgesagt lobbying against free knowledge and open-source and for monopolizing biotech for billionaires, speaking out for government tracking and reduction of privacy. You people are ridiculous.
I love the fact that first, he scares me and then reassures me that humanity won't go extinct.
3:50 Umbrella corp 😨
re 4 logo :)
This is amazing
All the effort we humans put into mitigating the sufferings of life when we could just not bring life into the world and therefore spare that life all forms of suffering anyway. It's like one big joke.
I should be tracked? Kurtsgezat supports tracking? Jesus christ, you lot fell off _so_ hard. And I _highly_ doubt you can easily buy dangerous viruses off of some eBay equivalent. _And_ information sharing between, to and from scientists is a great thing that should never be impaired as a veil for totalitarian information control.
Just love you guys! 💛 Thank you for your hard work!
I work in the vaccine field and have degrees in molecular biology and biochemistry. I am still way more worried about nuclear weapons than about bio weapons.  At first I wanted to criticize the video, but I see other people from the field already pointed out that the proposed mechanisms are already in place. Not anyone can order gene fragments and ordering gene fragments of deadly viruses is very restricted. The video is indeed overly alarming and the DIY bio hacker community does not have bad intentions for the overwhelming majority and already a hard time. And the professional community has already many restrictions in place. However, taking a second look, I find the video better than my initial gut reaction. Even though it is a bit over the top, the points are valid, and kurzgesagt is not trying to halt research but accelerate it. There is still much progress needed in waste water surveillance and in pandemic preparedness. Putting resources towards battling infectious diseases is a worthwhile investment.
I'm sorry, but the huge snarling face on the thumbnail gets a Do Not Recommend from me. Until YouTube supports a "random frame thumbnail option" for mobile, I'm going without your videos in my feed. I don't need stressful click bait.
Me in my basement at 3 am combining viruses with radioactive materials:
This is disgusting, now places like this can openly just say what million's of people where censored / fired / abused and demonized for.  And yes, anyone that thinks  it came from bats and not the literal lab studying the same and making the same diseases then ... their brain dead.
This is one of your best videos ngl tho.
Nukes are still worse because even hell bs death diseases don't turn the planet it'self into a radioactive husk that ALL life cannot live in, including any lucky bio-immune humans. It even destroys natural resources, so anyone left is still doomed with an even shittier future.
Keeping information out of the public knowledge aka censorship? I might be dumb af but that doesn't sound right
The fact that humans still retain our stone-age tendencies, including destructive tendencies, when faced with social pressures and we have modern technology available to us is quite scary to me. It doesn't have to be a religious or political extremist to try to pull off mass chaos----it could take someone who believes he's completely lost his social status and feels overwhelmed and acts out of spite. This is what we see from more common acts of public mass murder.
wow what a shitass video. information should be paywalled behind textbooks so that no one can access it actually - the less that scientific information is freely accessible to all, the more we shall prosper!! ...disinformation? dont-dont worry about that, im sure people will be able to tell whats what...

Problem is we cannot count on hostile nations 🇨🇳 to cooperate
i like how they added a resident evil refrence
Gain and function labs. 😊
Actually the covid virus itself was never isolated  and tested upon so you can create a vaccine. It's structure and functions were simulated on a computer and recreated from there, which in turn means it was a synthetic cousin of the true virus. The reason why so.many people felt sick from vaccinating or why so many had adverse symptoms from it it's just this: the vaccine was created not for a true virus, but from a simulated one. Which in turn means the vaccine could've not worked 100% on the true virus each and every time . Simple explanation for simple things.
Ok, this video is actually ridiculous. Wtf are you advocatinf for man?
I​ think its​ the​ thing​ between reality​ and​ Internet, because​ you​ might​ wanna​ take​ a​ look, its​ not​ anything else, its​ us...human.​ We​ create, we​ destroy, we​ fight, we​ died.
you see this type of advancement in many fields, the DJI drone you bought from Walmart for 500 bucks, has even more advanced system than a top secret military drone 20 years ago that cost billions of dollars
is/are kurzgesagt fascist???
Thank you for mocking people with over-manipulated dogs (or rats, how I like to call them)
is that radioactive spider named 42?
“Subject to scientific debate” my fuckin ass
4:46 kurzgesagt caught swearing?
Everyone just gonna ignore the fact that they just posted some fun normal artsy photo and I assume Twitter Yet again flamed them. Damn
7:26
Designer germ warfare goes back to "Sixth Column" published in of "January thru March 1941 Astounding" where Heinlein or MacDonald described a biolistic transfection BB gun or a cold plasma electroporation gun for "Science of Science Fiction" by Peter Nichols and Jeannette Ngo to both label as "racism" of Roosevelt's Politically Correct WWII.   Such a story inspired retaliation by Unit 731 who could not extract DNA from POWs who they placed inside centrifuges to extract protoplasm under x-rays to no avail while today any Police State's forensic PCR Thermocycler could have already targeted anyone for reactionaries to use mutagenic sprays to protect privacy from potential weirder psychiatric dystopias.       Even "Omega Glory" Trekkie episode and "Flash Gordon: episode "Purple Death" had Unit 731 as a story arc plot to reflect Rodenberry's WWII racism.       Patents do show how Gilead Pharmaceuticals aided and abetted Wuhan Virological while satellite photos show Peoples Liberation Army trucks at such a facility so while it is not germ biological warfare still one must consider China has a Brobdingnagian population for at least one case of biotech hooliganism since a biohacker online did threaten bioterrorism while America is downwind from China means anyone could have sent microencapsulated freeze dried viruses to float on prevalent winds.
7:46 does not realize how generations inside a pristine clean room might loose their immunity or future generations might have dark completions due to radiation and have East Asian epicanthus on eyelids to resemble Hottentots such as Kung tribes.
5:59 best defense is an air shower clean room with suction hole floors with cyclonic precipitators since any cellular fragment can be infectious due to Brownian motion since agricultural farms and rail transit trains dump infectious waste so please require them to use autoclaves and irradiators to sterilize.
I love you kurzgesagt
fuck yeah i can build a nuclear bomb in my backyard
I love the casual Umbrella reference.
So the viral of medical journology published an article about a new bat shit virus.
bro thinking in the future im being overflowing with information
Wait you can just order them? Time to research how to make the deadliest and cheepest virus before any known cure is made and spread it as fast as I can. Thank you for this idea!
I wouldn't use the failed c19 vaccine as something to use as a "good" example. Plus, it's been confirmed it was a lab leak. Much misinformation in this video.
They couldn't even manage to keep an eye on a well-known group in the US (Eco Health Alliance) and their collaborators in China (Wuhan Institute of Virology), so how on earth will they ever be able to keep an eye on everybody with access to internet on this planet?
We should hunt down anybody who is doing gain of function research on dangerous viruses.
Covid19 came from a lab. It is the single deadliest man-made disaster.
Just imagine some random scientists trolls the internet by posting a bionuke blueprint in 4Chan
Guys dont talk about covid vaccine like it was something good😂 cmon..
Batshit 😂
Keep information free! Its the best tool we have and a powerful weapon against those who would use it for evil.
GENEVA CONVINTION! COME ON! STOP BEING LAZY!!!!
Great video, as always. However I think they overlooked a key aspect: Culture. During the 2020 pandemic, we saw a LOT of people in the USA putting themselves and others at risk for purely political reasons. The Bible doesn't say you can't have a vaccine, yet thousands of people thought so anyway, just to "own the libs". Which is moronic, but hey, that's 50% of the population. So if there is ever a new global pandemic, everyone already knows that the USA will be it's most prolific breeding ground.
Why is hearing him say among us so funny
Anyone heard about the bio lab in fresno??
Ppl who had the corona virus and was fine 👇  yep i liked my own comment
Star treks and sneeze lol
Cloverfield is real there’s another universe that’s connected too me,there are things underneath the planet that are massive compared to us they trample over everything, there are spore like things in the earth as well, god is real so repent and be ready, lizard like people are among us, metatrons cube and all the ancient Egyptian things are real Thoth is real, never ever trust the government, something is gonna happen real soon I don’t know what but it’s bad, they try too make an avengers like team and it doesn’t work at all never trust the government, I can fly I have all my charkas aligned but the other universe that is connected to me has NeuroLink tech that’s how they are communicating with me but the neurolink is so strong I can feel there thoughts and emotions so it’s prohibiting me from flying, there trying too take me over there so I’ll probably be in a coma state here, so remember these things cause I’m the key, you will need too build striker eureka gypsy danger and basically replicate those 10 times build a space race early because if you don’t listen your gonna have too leave the planet just like they did build multiple ark like vessels like from transformers fall of cybertron or halo ring like machines that are habitable, also for the underground things that live there you will need to build something like the hammer of dawn to destroy them, never trust the government ever
Most dangerous weapon is a loud, smelly fart in a small crowded area
Lol the pug is recycled from the video about rabies
Keep in mind this channel has been funded by Bill Gates, an open advocate of 'population control', and now we're being told to expect new pandemics in the future
Kurtzgeat your a great channel but i feel like your focusing more on very fearmongering stuff can you focus on more of the positive impacts of humanity or how we can improve our mental health    Or maybe talk about the more postive ways we canbuse this technology's
What a time to be alive
The real pandemic is the ever increaseing felt need to control our environment and ourself as well as greed.
I want to create mars potencial  plants
All the people complaining about this video can see not further than 10 years in the future and have absolutely no idea about cyber crimes. If information is stored digitally, there is always the change of security breaches. And the technology to sequence genome is advancing with a rapid pace, anyway.
I just downloaded omegavirus.exe help
I don't think there is ANY technology that is inherently good or bad. Yes gunpowder is the basis of guns, at the same time it has good uses, like fireworks. Or take c4, it is one of the most common explosives and has killed countless people both on purpose and by accident, on the other hand it can make mining much faster and easier, or it can be used to weld massive pipes back together. Take knifes, they were used for combat for Milena, they also help clear trails and defend yourself from wild animals and thugs trying to rob or kill you.
Going MAXIMUM woke it seems
Why does no one in the comments realize that the danger isn't what can go wrong now, but what could go wrong in the future if we continue playing with fire like this. Biotech will continue to improve, become cheaper and more accessible.  You seriously lack imagination if you think "Even though there has been a massive amount of progress and there probably will be in the future, I can't literally order a supervirus today in the mail, therefore nothing can go wrong if we continue like this" is a good argument.
I would say the most embarrassing thing kurzgesagt has done is parrot all the lies about covid.
Biology betray me! ( I mean, literally, I don't lie to you, but I have been betrayed by biology )
Thats where communism comes. In this capitalist world, anyone can have access to viruses or dangerous information but in communism its not possible. So what all we need is just communism. A peaceful world for everyone. Its hard but not impossible.
A lab, not a bat. Its been settled. China virus
Kurzgesagt fucked this one up. Certainly not the same quality as we are used to have from them.
Paused the video to research the Vela Incident referenced on screen and went down a rabbit hole of nuclear reactivity studies including Mie Scattering, for over an hour before I remembered to return to this video. In a roundabout way you guys still did your job of educating people right. Lol.
I still ain't afraid of no rona
Зачетное видео
Im sure someone has said this, but the only reason the COVID vaccine was made so quickly was 1) due to decades of (fairly) open access research on coronaviruses, and 2) how all the flux of covid research was very accessible across the world during the early stages of the pandemic. Making research secret  when it comes to public health will only do a diservice to the field, especially during catastrophies
This isnt fun anymore 😢
This video in a nutshell: "Guys, somebody with thousands of dollars and no experience at all could make a bioweapon, and only the government is allowed to do that."
6:54
came from china, financed by the usa, virus was only good for the ones that profited from it. the sheeps that took it, now have heart problems.
4:29 kfc
guess what guys. north korea has a lot of bioweapons. and ALL OF THEM ARE SUPER DEADLY
3:15 I got new idea for my science exhibition  Thanks bro😊
Some would argue that the secrecy about nuclear power isn't compatible with a democracy, especially a post-colonial one that deals with what used to be their colony to mine uranium. Hiding scientific data from the public as soon as there is a danger is certainly a slippery slope that would lead to less confidence in scientific organizations, in the best case. Which informations are to be controlled and who can get them are very political questions.
im pretty sure u cant really build a nuclear bomb without an enriched nuclear material, equipment to handle should easily be picked up by satellites
don’t give me any ideas man
LOL That Umbrella Corporation Logo....
I love these videos and I hope that my kids one day see how valuable it is to have ideas shared like this. Great work!
Plague inc??
Great filter??

Uhm, sorry, the "unknown" you speak of was laboratory created and thus very well known and vaccines had been researched since uknown 2. By the time a certain ten and nine unknown rolled around it was simple to "adjust" the vaccine. Which was rolled out too early with no testing because the whole unknown was a ponzy scheme, basically.
Why does this video push the lab leak theory?  It's been debunked...  Moreover, it's not easy to make a new virus even for a state actor, let alone diy people in their garages...
As much as I enjoy kurzgesagt's content, I'm glad people are pushing back against the channel's narrative. They have a bad underlying ideology, talk about implausible technologies, and use doomerism to get attention.
bananas are the most radioactive fruit.
Oh wow…

“New batshit virus discovered” 😂😂
bacteriophages are going to replace antibiotics
The one thing about technological advancement that continues to terrify me is that the more powerful things we develop, the more likely that a single madman can ruin everything.  Sure, we could have a solution to medical issues. Or some crazy person thinks up a supervirus to kill everyone.  And it only takes one crazy person. Makes me think the answer to the Fermi Paradox is that once a civilization reaches a certain level of power it will cause self extinction.
out here leaking my plans bruh🤦‍♂
Didn't know this, thanks! Gonna end this planet now, bye!
It’s either A.I. or zombies
3:49 I didn't know the Umbrella Corporation was a sponsor. I love Kurzgesagt 😂
I’ve never had any interest in stuff like this, but you guys can somehow make any topic interesting
Surprise surprise, the video talking about viruses and vaccines is the one that triggered the most incels. But hey, they are just "thinking for themselves", amirite?
There might be even more info that they keep hidden  We only know that lot of info is known cause that's all we know
yay i needed to know how easy it is to weaponize viruses and create worldwide pandemics... its not like we now how fast they spread

I had no idea that dangerous Virus DNAs can be downloaded just like that!! I just searched and there are .dna files everywhere from SARS-COV to every other virus How can the governments let that happen?
😂😂😂😂😂
Step one; get a jug of stagnant pond water. Step two; get a jug of hand sanitizer. Step three; put them in a blender and mix for a good long time. Step four; wait for the 0.01% of germs that survive to breed again until you have a blender full of germs that are immune to hand sanitizer. Step five; take a sample and set it aside. Step six; mix in a new antibiotic and turn the blender back on for a bit. Step seven; allow it to breed again. Step eight; set aside a sample. Step nine; repeat steps 6 through eight until you run out of ideas for antibiotics to use.  Congratulations you have a blender full of germs entirely immune to anything you thought of to throw at it.
glad to see that no one believes this, its just fear mongering
Someone give this man and his team a seat in W.H.O
All Channels are great. What I'm curious about, how is the special animation created? May I ask what software or applications do you guys use to create them - It's so fascinating.
Given all the criticism of this video, I think this will end up as one of the videos that gets retracted. Very sensationalist and low quality compared to what people have come to expect.  You need to do better guys, because this looks like dropping quality in to promote a viewpoint you've been paid for.
stop playing dumb kurzgesagt. Everyone knows exactly where the come from. With china is the same as with russia, everyone knows what they are up to or what they did but no one says a thing.
Seems legit
The 1000$ number is actually a bit outdated. We are about to hit the 500$ number, which is the general number health insurance companies quote when asked how much genome-sequencing has to cost for it to be used as a general component of health care. Get into the hospital with an issue, you are sequenced and screened for allergies/tolerances to certain medications and so on.  Personalized medicine, down to your DNA, is about to happen.
Terrible video, you should really take it down. We don't need this fearmongering.
Keep keep up the good work I like your videos a lot of your Murch a lot I bought the duck plushy to I like it a lot❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍😍😀🤩🥳🥳
We had systems in place to stop the most recent pandemic, but world leaders were too busy smelling their own farts to care to actually enact the plans. Especially the United States and China. By the time the general public were hearing about it the scientists that discovered it had been dissaspeared for months and it was already too late to stop international spread.
Nobody: Kurzgesagt giving everyone anxiety for fun:
it makes since that something like that could happen but it would be really difficult for Sutch a thing to happen because if all the information and genetic code was online you could just make a less dangerious version of the virus and then you could make a vaccine.
Usually channel is on point but this one is….brought to you by Phizer!
we should drop a bomb on one of these facilities and see what happens

9:35 Perhaps a different point of vie could help. The fact that everyone takes you seriously, that they consider what you say to be very reliable is actually a *HUGE* compliment. It shouldn't be hurtful at all.     Granted, you made a mistake, but unless you screw up from time to time, you aren't doing anything worthwhile. So expect to make more mistakes.

BioTech has advanced to the level of  threat to human existence but still unable to treat more than 90% of chronic disease effectively. Researchers really need to change their priority.
10:00 couldnt we have done all these for covid? if it didnt work for covid how could it work for sth intentionally made stronger and harmful
7:26 AMONG US
Maybe we should just let the viruses lose so that the societies better at dealing with emergencies survive, therefore improving humanity as a whole.
Control over all biology  ?   Sounds like playing God.
If you use auto-generated caption at 7:26 the words "among" and "us" are capitalized.
Good vid could you make a video on how uranium might be used as a fuel source or something about the environment
Its kinda weird too how kurzgesagt has vanished after this video, this is not like them at all, even the people dont have faces in the animation.

Hi 😍 I always enjoy your videos and the way you explain everything so smoothly 🫠 Thanks to your channel I've learned alot and I wish there was persion version of your channel in Iran as the majority of Iranians especially students can't understand english due to limited teaching methods at schools or even universities ! Personally, I've spend so many hours in english classes to learn it and if you give us this opportunity, my friend and I are willing to create persion version of Kurzgesagt .. I don't know how much information you have about here but we couldn't even purchase your book as they haven't shipping to Iran! So honestly our aim is increasing our society member's awareness.. 💔🌹

This is a breath of fresh air to infographic
Bio technology is just as bad as making the thermonuclear bomb. It will kill anything
actually,if in the future all the viruses are mostly killed,then is the immune system to weak,so more vulnerable in case when they come back,so then would the normal influenza being more dangerous then many many other things.Good for knowledge,bad for future
The 1# thing to do about the current state, protocol, and how to shape where it goes is 100% integration and accountability. It will only take one case of one nasty thing let loose one time to potentially reduce us to a state we might be able to come back from…and it’s important enough to not play political games with and lead by example.. propose we all work together on any project.. have one main lab but several others spread out for emergencies… be upfront and open about everything, and push for an agreement of SEVERE punishments if any subterfuge is acted out or even hinted at.. need to move all nuclear work to this kind of system too… too many politicians w biased interests and jaded prejudices running this shit for too long… in the past it was fine to compete and bicker for resources and waste lives w wars… but literally everything is interconnected now.. if almost any country or people get hit w almost anything, it neg affects us all.. accept that ‘race’ isn’t even an actual real word or classification, put aside your ignorant ways of the past, embrace our differences as the varying individual strengths that they really are, cause we need to pull together now more than ever… the dmg to the environment isn’t gonna wait till we quit threatening bombs over petty,over exaggerated, differences… and underlying all of it is a severe ‘misinformation( inability to even understand what knowledge is, discovered, and used) plague’ that is corrupting us and everything we do…
Anyone else concerned that the increased rate of uploads may be impacting kurzgesagt's quality of videos? I feel like they may be making more and more content with less and less real effory behind it. Just flashy visuals and vague sciencey sounding stuff. I know that may be a kittle harsh but as many people pointed out, a lot of this video is either false or waaayy overblown and i feel like its a bit concerning. Kurzgesagt's videos reqch a lotta people and amyone who treats their word as gospel could start being more misinformed if they keep going like this.
Well, at least anyone interested in this channel is smart enough to question them when they start sounding stupid
I think this brings up another question, if biotechnology advances to the point where humans can easily and affordably edit their genes in major ways (such as being able to make people be able to pretty much customize their bodies, though that seems unrealistic, but then that's what we would say about modern technology a couple decades ago.) What would be classified as a human, or would humans become claaified as a group of different species?
Plz ponha isso no em poucas palavras kurzgezagt ainda em 2023😢
thats not an accurate number of powerstations. that is a number of reactors. most powerstations have more than one reactor. this is unacceptable. please dont be wrong when i fact check you, germany. that was what the nazis were upto. dont be nazia, germany. it's someone elses turn
I love your videos guys! Please make one about speed of light and how this is "too slow" compared to the massive of the universe.
Can u make a video on derealization and depersonalisation, like that would be pretty interesting under your narrations
I thought they did something to prevent this after publishing the human genome?

oerekosieen druyan-arikidro...
I laughed whe. They talked about how quickly the covid virus got analyzed. Yeah thats cause they were doing gain of function research in wuhan 😂 they had a vaccine b4 the virus even broke out
once genie is out of the bottle you can't stuff her back in again! if you set rules then only the rules followers are affected, negatively, the rogues are advantaged by prohibiting something you create class distinctions and thus a black market equating virus production to producing nuclear weapons is not a good analogy due to the difficulty of obtaining raw nuclear materials and then enriching it, not an issue with biologicals  if you gate access to knowledge you then create an underground of those who will not be denied, and who are clever enough to escape detection, thus not only using existing art, but potentially developing they own, in isolation and secrecy  forewarned is forearmed, knowledge, for better or worse, will not be suppressed ...
Who are the good people they're talking about in this video ? ... Big pharma and bill gates ? 😂😂😂 So many of these companies / groups of shared interests are pushing for these kinds of regulations.

@Kurzgesagt used a curseword! "Batshit Virus", on the cover of a textbook @4:45. I don't know what to think about that! lol-I'm no Karen and I cuss like a sailor in real life, but I'm still shocked :P
riight the vaccine
The public availability is sort of a double edged sword. For one thing, it can make treatment and vaccine research much faster as scientists won’t be starting from square one every time a pandemic rolls around. For the other, as you guys quite brilliantly demonstrated, it empowers ill-willed individuals to cause devastating damage to humanity’s progress.
- 0:34 "Humans manipulate living things" - Could covid have been created in a lab?  - No way you dumb conspiracy theory lover!
Lemme guess, restrict biotech and information to the state and our "rich masters", or we'll all die? How "unpredictable"...
Amazing! Please make a video about AOH1996 cancer killing medicine and how it works. 🙏🏽🥳
I love Kurzgesagt
Informative content Thank you
Please make on eye flu that spread in India rapidly now😢
Merci.
I THOUGHT YOU LEFT US😔
7:26 AMONGUS
If you're an anxious person, never just watch the first half of a Kurzgesagt video. 😂
Just imagine if someone takes the infectivity of the COVID virus and simply adds the deadliness of rabies. Bye bye humanity.
Kurzgesagt's Graphics is so extremely beautifully.
You should make funny cartoons you will get likes
Now I wonder what the effects of genetic engineering on Humans might be. If we edit our own DNA, it could be possible to create a new, stronger generation of people. Human mk II. The ethics of this are going to be hard to debate either way.
Too Bad!
Well Maybe because they had data for covid19 before lab leak
So wait are furries not gonna need fursuits now
Love checking in on this channel and seeing it's the same old clickbait nonsense that the masses eat up.
When's the next video coming?  I've watched them all, and, just finished reading Immune.  I am going through withdrawal now!
I think a video on colonizing Mercury, the asteroid belt, and Jovian system would be cool.
Audio   Hindi option laiye
How's that myocarditis treating you there, sport?
kurzgesagt, I feel like you're just doing things for the views now. trying to grab attention with 'deadly' and urgent titles and thumbnails. these past few years' videos seem to be about all about crises, death, it's not so much about the science that you're passionate about anymore. my fav vids from you are: dissatisfaction, the past we can't return to, what is intelligence, when time became history, loneliness, Beauty explained
Hi Kurzgesagt! Could you make a video on different life form bases? Such as Silicon based life forms (for ex, here on earth, we are carbon based) and other potential based life forms?
Biological warfare is more dangerous than nuclear
Remember there's no planet B.
When Openheimer thought he was the destroyer of worlds. He was wrong.
좋다😊😂
Modifying existing viruses requires getting the virus and doing very specific work on it. If we could create microbes from just knowing the sequence of their genetic material and creating it easily, this could open up a Pandora’s box that would make ghost guns look benign.
Zombies???
bullshit hopium again
Hey, I appreciate you guys and wanted to thank you for presenting a frightening topic with a hopeful air and ideas and processes that make it more manageable. I enjoy your episodes with visualizations of a good future for humanity.
This is one of the only kurtzgesagt videos i firmly disagree with
fasting is good ?
Anyone saw umbrella corporation same one in resident evil 😂
You know it gets serious when Kurz's background music changes and his tone/the way he he talks sounds different.
Yooo mr DNA 4:03
Sometimes I watch this guys videos to pretend I’m smart
I love it how its incredibly simplified but you can still recognize wikihow at
The easiest way to avoid pandemics. Let me tell you. What if we k!l bill gates and other billionaires from this world who are actually controlling this world and spreading all kind of pand
Lol, who paid Kurzgesagt to produce this?
I was worried this was going to be anti-biolabs/makerspaces.  It's not.  I have more thoughts in my self reply.
Will kurzgesagt be doing a video concerning LK-99?
Can a make a Kurzgesagt video game?
Oh by the way, kurzgesart are you going to carry on the ant videos con me and my brother are BIG fans🐜🐜🐜!
It is literally the first time in our History we are facing something like this.   We have no control over how ideas influence our minds.   We praise progress for progress' sake, and we refuse to see the downsides of it.
Lol
Say zero in German 300 times 🤣🤣🤣😂😂
This video seems like it wanted to be released at the beginning of the Covid pandemic, but even then, we can’t just build viruses that easily. With most research related things, you need to be apart of a university to get anywhere. And if these people had any graduate education, they’d know research is difficult 😂
kurzgesagt still a Banger every Ep Shared , ty !) for u'r hardwork
We're still not sure if Corona came from nature or released accidentally? That statement alone almost garnered you an unsub. It was released on purpose, and created in the Wuhan lab. This fact was released weeks after the virus became known publicly. The fact that this channel, of all channels is regurgitating this long debunked rhetoric is just disgusting and shameful.
Curing diseases? I must have missed something because I don't recall a single disease being cured in centuries.
Turkish subtitles please
This is so sensasionalist it's annoying, what happened to this channel?
holy shit guys - I've been building a nuke in my backyard for a decade! Now I don't feel like the most dangerous person in my hood(((
Number one issue when making a bioweapon: the first person it infects will be YOU. (Although if you are completely insane, this may be the idea).
Excuse me? Nanofilters and virus-killing UV lamps? I need to know more other things like these that are getting out there, it's absolutely fascinating
Could you please make a video on different types of radiation and what they do.
A wiht hole exists !!!
Thanks YouTube, for not recommending this to me for THREE WEEKS. I know, recommending content of people I have been subscribed to for years is completely unthinkable, but come on!
"accidentally" "transparant shared research"   Meanwhile Chinese Govt. : What he says! Good god we fooled them nice. So remember guys, since it was so successful, just play the racial card and reverse card to avoid any real criticism from western countries, they're too dump to discern politics from ethnicity and too docile to insist on investigating for truth.
Can you make a video about Mantises? Please 😊
Kurzgesagt .Stimmt es, dass der Mars einen seiner Monde verlieren wird?
Biotech is crazy
Kurzgesagt 2.0. Keep educating people, not sponsors.
I have watched every video my favorite video is  The EGG
You have to be scarred. Why aren't you scared right now?
"New Batshit virus discovered" nearly missed that one! 4:46
How and where can I buy lab equipment?
😂BATSHIT 4:47
Would love you guys to make a video on Lichen Sclerosis. A disease that can be debilitating, lead to cancer and whilst rare in men is very common in women.
"Getting better at getting vaccines faster than ever before in history"  Likely an incredibly important and achievable task. The only failure here is how dumb people are. People who not only refuse vaccines and get their information from facebook, but spew that misinformation and berate you if you don't accept it.  Like always, our lowest dag us down to failure as a society.
Too late, I'm making the ultimate life form
So... Vaccines and philanyropy in this video too 😂
Hi, why you don't add a polish laguange in your movies? I very like watch movies on your channel because they are very interesting but a lot of words i can't understand if you talk about unusual topic. Can you add a polish language in yours content? 😢
i want more ant videossss
4:47 bottom of the third book 😅
Not your best work. The video seemed, dare I say, a little shilly at times.
This video has 3.4M views. You just told that many people they can get DNA online and the equipment to work on it themselves. Isn't that rather stupid? I had no idea you could do this and I bet a lot of crazy people out there didn't either until now.
7:50 “we basically need to build a machine that’s ready to destroy any pandemic threat before it has a chance to take over” You mean, like what we have in the immune system?
fvck gmo. dude is like biotechnology this biotechnology that, nice rebrand attempt...
Love your videos, when is the next one ??
What do you think I need to know in order to think like you?
Please do an updated vid about the Ebola virus
Hey kurzgesagt, I'm south Korean. I have a idea. Please make a video about duck's life.
What are red shift galaxies and how did the James Webb telescope see them
7:26
Food crops resistant to climate change? That probably GMO, something that people love to b*tch about...
한국어 자막 제발요
Hey kurzgesagt if black hole stars possibly exist what about possible white hole stars
Why do all this guys videos look and sound like a commercial for a certain billionaire "philanthropist"........
More techno-fascist propaganda from the playbook of FTX and the Gates Foundation peddled for cash from Kurzgesagt megastudios "edit human biology"
Be like fear of the walking dead.
It be cool if we found a way to cheat death . Be like timelords off of doctor who
If i were a sciencetist that made a virus that could repordose . Id release it
💙💙💛💛
"worst case, hundreds of millions, worse than any nuclear bomb"???? sure one singular nuclear bomb but nuclear war could easily kill 99% of humans way faster than any bio weapon
This is a very good and useful video Thanks
More fear mongering
Dude, the world is advancing so fast that I can see the future being built.
Stop giving us ideas. The intrusive thoughts are so loud rn. Great video.
Bro why in the cancer city you used among us cells or bacterias
Where is the intro? And narrator sounded kinda "tired" or "not interested". Just a question. LLMs were used for everything, or just the scrypt?
3:35 For people who were convinced COVID-19 was a bioweapon leaked from a Chinese laboratory, why didn't you go not just facemask, but full military grade or CDC grade gas mask?  If it were a bioweapon, conspiracies about the pandemic being fake or the vaccine containing a homing beacon or whatever would likely have been disseminated by China to trick us into not wearing masks, social distancing, and getting vaccinated against it. Do you want the Reds to win?  Even if this time were an accident, foreign governments now know how poorly the American public responded to precautionary measures, they saw the rate and direction of the spread, and can now more effectively launch the next bioweapon.
Kurzgesagt should stop accepting financing from any organizations as a sponsorship and return to crowd funding model.
What did all the birbs go?
Misinformation. The U.S. and China were in on covid.
Nice  vaccine 😂😂😂
is it me or does the animation look a bit worse than usual?
"As the Americans learned so painfully in Earth's final century, free flow of information is the only safeguard against tyranny. The once-chained people whose leaders at last lose their grip on information flow will soon burst with freedom and vitality, but the free nation gradually constricting its grip on public discourse has begun its rapid slide into despotism. Beware of he who would deny you access to information, for in his heart he dreams himself your master. Commissioner Pravin Lal, 'U.N. Declaration of Rights' " From the game Sid Meyer's Alpha Centauri
This is very weak. I expect much better from you guys. Are you trying to get on Joe Rogan or something?
Imagine underground virus competition where everyone brought their most dangerous virus and let them eat each other
Next episode about corruption and how politicians make money pls
Reminds me of how a substitute teacher taught us how nuclear bombs work in high school chemistry as an extra lesson bc we finished the lecture early
STILL SAYING THAT THERES ACHANCE COVID 19 IN WUHAN DIDN'T COME FROM THE WHUAN CORONAVIRUS RESEARCH LAB
The average Kurzgesagt video be like: Oppenheimer for subject matter Barbie for the art style lol Love your videos though
Although I love most Kurzgesagt videos, somehow I don't know how to feel about this one. Something is off about the tone and premise...
i gotta disagree with some of the points in this video. withholding information from the public is irresponsible and immoral. information should be more free and more open. everyone has a right to learn and saying otherwise flies in the face of what this channel is supposed to represent.
I thought only I felt that kurzgesagt was getting out of line
"Where is this sudden advancement coming from?"   Simple. Prothean artifacts. Duh.
How come people dont talk about this and other thing we know better
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
Have you seen the new channel impersonating you guys? Is it part of your community? It's called human in a nutshell.
ahh yes i love my daily dose of climate change fear mongering
The United States DEA budget for 2023 is $2.4 trillion
Quando isso Será postado no em poucas palavras kurzgesagt😢
7:00 ah yes more and more invigilation, for our safety of course
Thank you.❤
Mhmm mustard gas...
Wow 6:07 Akira reference?
It doesn't work.. aren't you seeing how sick you're making yourselves by trying to have everything clean, sterile and dead?
I wasnt sure whether the feeling I was getting from the video was based, but thankfully I can see in the comments that more people are noticing, I'm so glad critical thinking is not dead. I know very little about biology and chemistry but could notice this video feels like kurtzgesagt just repeating in their own style the worldview and ideas of someone else.
They have a game🎉
❤❤❤ the video it so fun.😂vary funny.
❤❤
oppenheimer reference
Guys I have an idea
the dog on the right is infected by lyssa virus 0:32
Could you please make a video about 536 the worst year in known history
I am very pleased to see people questioning this video, its messages, and sensationalism, all while adding correct information. As Kurzesagt gets influenced by donors and deadlines, the people are upholding what is needed
ok these videos are good but wtf are the frakin thumbnails????
Adding knowlege? Allright. Kids building iphones? Nu-uh,they get LESS things to learn (at least where i live) and still have a hard time to make it. Id wish tho. Anyway,i Do beleave that biotech is the future. Bio computers etc have been an interesting subject. Tho i dont know how doable that is,becouse i do know that biology is...messy. and our biology would be possible to change fully only in embryos im pretty sure (tho biology isnt realy that much my thing) ,and were far way from there
RFK spilled the proverbial 'beans'. a week ago.
4:45 newest batshit virus discovered 😭😭
I know I am from Hong Kong near China scientist is doing a experiment with a bat he didn’t throw away and feed people
I do not like looking at .exe because I am GNU/Linux user.   I am 100% not hacker
Hay kurzgesagt what happens to the body when yellow fever enters it?
Moist dangerous thing is inflation for humanity
Thanks, as a Junior Supervillain I find this very informative 😂
I feel like a lot of people are at a crossroads with this channel recently. I'm beginning to think they're not entirely unfounded in their complaints and distaste in recent videos.  Though I do notice that every video this happens on, is sponsored. I don't know what kind of clamps they're putting on you exactly, maybe a time constraint, informational gatekeeping, etc.  But I do know it goes against the principles on which your channel was founded.  Please, do not let them consume you. You need money. Who doesn't. I get it. But this is the cost. Can you pay it and still keep your morals in tone, or will you let it take over fully?  I do hope you make the right choice, because you know more than us that this is getting out of hand.
Hey my dad asked me how do stars burn?
Loved the umbrella Easter egg
Cool
bruh why
Hey Kurzgesagt  can you make a video about Old life in mars , about thire extinction events and  could life  still be in mars😊
Bro. I could make nuclear fission from YouTube videos if given the resources.
can you make one about time dilation? mb if you don't take recommendations but I've been researching about time dilation and if find it extremely interesting and hope others can learn more about it and perhaps find joy in learning about it like me :)
Two words: thanks obama
It doesn't seem impossible for zombie apocalypse to happen these years
Easily solved: “Perhaps there’s a way we can … inject the disinfectant into the body and just kill the virus” _Donald J Trump_
Damn, we got hit awhile ago with a pandemic, still not solved it. It's called influencers
I have a video idea. So you know how you basically sacrifice one part of a person to cure another? Like damaging the liver by antibiotics a little bit to cure something else? What if that concept was applied to every human on earth? All deceases suddenly become spread thin equally among the human population. Would all humans be healthy? Or sick?
Sorry typos
Question, didn’t kurgesart all ready touch on this subject Shawn they talk d about GM crops?
Video idea: How to terraform Ganymede
GUYS I GOT AN AD FOR WATCHING KURGEZAT VIDEO
Make video in zombie apocalypse
yeaaa i Miss You kurzgesagt Im back To Watch You again!!
"Science is a gift but also curse"
Why are the ducks fear mongering 😢
"Humans manipulate living things."  Humans manipulate humans
I come from  Y si? Channel. Nice video. I´m from Ecuador and I am learning English.
OFC Kurzgesagt is advocating for censoring and suppressing scientific information. Let me guess, another video brought to you by the bill and melinda gates foundation and pfizer?
If the last Pandemic taught us anything then it is that combating the next pandemic is not a technological challenge. It’s the idiocy of a plurality of the population and the eagerness of power hungry sociopaths to manipulate the situation for their own short term gain.
I like how we're putting a lot of effort into climate change resistant crops instead of actually seriously trying to stop climate change😢
milk
I like how he starts really dark then goes positive and tells us everyone will be fine😂
Man, imma buy some of that radioactive spider💀
Just trust the science people it’s all good 😂
"There's a revolution in biotech that's giving us the ability to cure previously incurable diseases."  And yet my doctor can't see me for more than a few minutes, and doesn't pay attention to anything that doesn't come from a blood test (which means that he only knows what they test for, like cholesterol). Welcome to the typical US healthcare.
This level of fear porn and blatant propaganda is surprising even for this channel. Of course you got paid to publish this
Can you make a video about lice and hair please 🙏
I love your channel ❤️❤️❤️. I just was wondering what was your real name
Heya! sorry if I'm late for 2 weeks and you might be already working on another video. There's also a chance that you might not even see this lol  Idea: "Blood pressure" . How does it work? . What do I do to avoid it? . What do i do if I have it?  I had low blood pressure and I got to normal over a few weeks. Though I thought that you can make a YouTube video guiding people how to beat it in days. Please, if you do see this, work on a video about blood pressure. That would really mean a lot to ...lots of people. Thank you if you actually see and read this. Good luck! :D
I want to become a virus now
Did anyone see the add at start 💀
Next vid: Can you do an explanation on dark matter, wormholes, etc. pls? Thanks.
We also need to try and make sure stupid people don't spread misinformation. Especially ones who might call it, I dunno, "Truth" or something.
Why not 4k?
I can't believe that the Corona vaccines are still presented as a miraculous solution. Their track record is awful on all fronts. P.S.: I'm not a tinfoil hat antivaxxer, I just don't think these ones are as good as the media, the politicians and this video make them out to be.
World ending virus: 'The really spicy stuff'
At the time 5 minutes and 11 seconds you can see the Pokémon Caterpie
Next video can it be, what’s Bermuda Triangle
I just finished watching "The day the earth stood still" and even though the end seems idyllic, I can't shake the feeling that humanity stands in a far worse situation than depicted. My question is: What would happen if all technology stopped working globally at the same time?
I don't why you're still saying you don't know where the virus came from when its been proven and the government itself has finally admitted it came from a lab in China. Please don't skew the facts. This information was released 2 months ago.
"Medical of Journal Virology" lololol
In Hindi language video
Please made a new channel for hindi dubbed video of this topics because i don't know English very well
A Kurzgesagt's video without intro?
"We still don't know if COVID came from nature or was the result of a leak from a lab..." Meanwhile Fauci is in America under trial for gain of function research in Wuhan that, as the video stated, had Carona... Come on man.
My god they didn’t do that pug justice. Made it look as retarded as it is Cruel for them to even be alive with the health problems we bred into them to make them look like the dog it is today.
High school in 30 years be like: You managed to cure a potential pandemic that could have killed millions if not stopped in time. Thanks to you, millions if families can enjoy their life freely again. I would like to give you an A, but since you wrote your findings on paper made from wood and not on any alternative paper, i have to give you a C
🤮
Rare footage: Kurzgesagt didn’t have its iconic intro

In this episode I haven't seen any classic bird boys what happened?
The concept of genetic engineering would be a lot less terrifying to me if the people talking about it didn't sound like eugenicists.
I'm relatively uninformed about this but this seems like it has a lot of mistakes in it. There's a lot of educated people in the comments saying it's incorrect as well.
Makes taking the biochem track feel pretty good!
Hmmmmmm, am I the only one who thought, this video should have finally been about AI and for some reason (cough..ro cough..soft) their hands were tied?
What's the difference between a black hole and a white hole
Hey Kurzgsegat! I’d like to suggest a video about vCJD. COVID has made us worry about diseases and biohazards for the first time in some years. I think vCJD is a silent danger lurking around, and more people should know about it.
This make me wondering what if i perceived my studies in biology because it was my dream to customize genes
Pretty sure we all learnt during COVID that the most 'successful' viruses walk the line of fatality as extremely lethal viruses have no chance to spread and infect others. Even if you created one with a very long incubation period with sudden onset death this would provide a large window for people to get treated and slow down the spread (and its ability to spread during this incubation period would likely be limited by the fact you need to be having symptoms to transmit things often). This will always provide a limiting factor on just how lethal a virus can really get.
Hi, I have a request to research about manifest video. People say when we see too much negativity, we also will get the negativity (Law of Attraction). Is it true and can we test / research from the scientific approach? Thank you very much for creating great video ! I really like the animation, the explanation, and also the ducks. Great work!
I love the audio on your videos, i am a slightly hard of hearing but your audio is crisp and at great volume compared to hundreds of other content creators.   Thank you!
Coronavirus most likely broken down a couple weeks because we had a whole bunch of lab on it already because we had done gain-of-function to it and created the human infectious version of it.           Duh
Can you make a video about structure of COVID please 🙏
Hi, I love you so much you are my favourite science channel ❤
Unsubscribed.
bro wrote batshit virus at 4:45 and thought we woudnt notice💀💀💀
A very shit vaccine I might add its been contacted with quite a few health conditions sadly giving the anti vaccine community some much need ammo
Your commitment to rigorous fact-checking and dedication to sparking curiosity is inspiring. Loved the story of the evolution map poster, it's a testament to your passion for science and learning. Can't wait to dive into more of your content!
Arabic translation pls
I mean, all the comments saying they work with biology saying it’s harder than portrayed in the video. They’re not actually wrong. Sure. In countries like central europe and the us, it would most likely be a underground governmental project, but in corrupt countries with a decent amount of money and education, it would not be that regulated and actually plausible. I mean i mostly agree with the comments, but i think people make it seem less plausible than it actually is from an international perspective.
I do agree with the notion that rapid technology advancements making toying around with dangerous stuff more possible to the average person is probably a bad thing, though I do also think we’re still in a stage where the amount of knowledge it takes to even be able to start to tinker with it is enough of a barrier to preventing a major catastrophe from random people, and that we’ll be in that stage for quite some time. Like I could also do a boatload of chemistry at home with off the shelf parts and chemical supplies, but the amount of knowledge I need to even know where to start and what to do and what order to do it in to make something destructive without hurting myself first is incredibly high. I’m more worried with the kinds of lab accidents that aren’t from things going super poorly just not quite as expected lulling people into a false sense of safety with their results.
my radioactive giraffe flu is almost rteady to unleash upon the world prepare for weeks of a slight headache mwahahaha
Going forward, please stick to science, this is the first video you've done where I feel like you focused more on sensationalism. You've made many videos so I understand there will be duds, we're all human, however, I value science, facts, logic and reason. In a world where that shit has literally become politicized and is outright denied is maddening and frustrating. Please do better and address this video as it's very disappointing to a majority of your viewers.
Yo kurzgesagt can you cover the (bose einstein condensate)
Specialized UV lamps at 8:00 with the patient happily being exposed to it? Only if you want to harm/kill the patient too
🤯 dude crazy to hear a channel this big say that it could have come from a lab… I remember when people were making fun of conspiracy theorists and now there’s a chance they were right 😳
I don't wanted to waste my time that's why i research about useful channel and i recommended your channel by Google Thanks Google
I like the oppenheimer reference
Wow, somehow i wasn't subscribed, but I've watched your videos for years. Fixed that. I want you to know as well that I appreciate all the research that goes into giving me just the cutest little existential crises. Please keep it going,
Your videos make me feel more sane.. genuinely comfort to my soul in knowing I’m not being “dramatic” or “psychotic” … all of what you have made so far— God bless you, thank you from the bottom of my heart
HEY!!!!! What happened to the birds?!?!?!
Favorite channel!
you make me think society has hope sir.
1:09 months before* the pandemic began
Hey guys do you think kurzgesagt still does the voice after he’s done recording?
I’m genuinely afraid 😅😅😅
Disapointed with this video.  Many people have already pointed out it´s many flaws. One I didn´t see expressed is that greater regulation, as is the case in nuclear, is one of the instruments that the "great powers" use to control the world. Kind of like how russia removed ukraine´s nuclear arsenal before invading the country. I´m not saying every individual should have acesses but every country should have acesse to the tools necessary to help it´s people.
Cute thumbnail
hi
Hey! Could you make a video explaining why such chemicals or things affect the rate of cancer? For example, ciggarettes. Why do they affect the rate of cancer, it would be good to hear it elaborated.
Umbrella Corp at 6:49 is just 🔥 😂
I swear to God I did not just hear "among us"
Thank you🤩
I saw your immune book in a store, my mom didn't let me buy it
I loved the part where they still don't know whether covid-19 came from nature or it was an accidental lab leak.
We need a video on the effects of a nuclear war
"aliens"
We shouldnt be messing with any of it! we are still here without it.
remember what we did for the pandemic? 7,000,000 deaths out of 7,000,000,000 is 1/1,000th the population over 3 years, or some .0003% annual death rate. remember what we did for this? was that called for? would you say it was appropriate?  would you say that MAYBE the cure was worse than the poison?? am i allowed to voice this opinion yet or am i still a mass murderer for looking at THE SCIENCE
Hope you guys don’t mind if I use this info for my summer speech.🙂
Ain't Capitalism grand? 😢
You were the one who convinced me to be a Scientist 10 years ago back in 2013 now here I'm with a degree in chemistry in Harvard and now I'm here with a business I don't have to do any thing so you are the reason I'm a millioner thank you kurguteraze
Is anyone still debating whether this came from a bat or from Fauci’s lab in Wuhan
If your American it cost you all your life saving to see any new treatment
There's no genetic evidence pointing to a man-made virus
The covid vaccine was available faster than ever because the virus itself was developed in a lab. This has already been determined by the evidence.
I know this channel isn't advocating censorship of knowledge?
Doctor Bombastic 💀💀💀
This channel is crazy good omg
loved the the umbrella corp. logo
can you prepare a video regarding TITAN submarine crash and implosion
Inb4 it becomes a trend to infect schools with diseases you ordered online
Amazing 👍
Amazing
7:25 leave me alone!
I gotta say how beautiful your explosions look
The 7 million death estimate of COVID is too low. It is more akin to 21 million, according to multiple analyses of excess death. 7 million is only the (lying governments of the world) reported number. I cannot link it here but see “The pandemic’s true death toll” by The Economist.
6:41 Dr.Bombastic's Bomb Tutorial💀
Wild thought, but maybe we as a species can chill with creating horrors beyond our comprehension? Find the cure for cancer or baldness and leave the artificially mutated deadly lab viruses in sci-fi books. Just a cute suggestion :3
Corona virus was made intentionally covid 19 is a hybrid virus
I see a lot of people saying this is an inaccurate video. I am not gene specialist, so I am inclined to agree with the experts that this is probably inaccurate.  Now I’m sure they have seen your comments. I bet they have rechecked their information. And if kurzgesagt also believes the video is inaccurate, they are in a bit of a conundrum.   Because they got funding from a 3rd party organization, they can’t just take the video down. The organization gave them money and expects to have a video. At the same time, a response video needs to go through the organization. Hopefully it gets corrected but I wouldent have too much hope.
Hmmm good idea
ROFL this poster is wrong as well.
Not to be rude or embarrass you again but… the scientist’s hand at 2:04 it’s kinda, let’s say, unusual 😅 Aside from that, excellent video and great information as always 💕
Amazing vid. Now do the next one about AI in the same way. Superintelligence.  Please just don't share too much infohazard. As little as necessary. Support 🙏
To be fair, Molecular Biology is cheap. Biochemistry is expensive and it’s Biochemistry that would allow someone to design a killer virus.  That said, our government monitors this silently and you wouldn’t get away with it unless you discovered it in the enivronment
ah i see they changed the title from "the next pandemic will be manmade"
Can you do more stuff that teachs you about psycology like the how to make friends stuff  Because what yall are doing rn is useing alot of peoplese fears   The frist couple minutes was really good but the rest of it was kinda eh because its way harder to do that then yall said it is   I absolutely love yall cause yall taught me alot about science and specifically genetic engineering but yall need to establish whats stoping this stuff and not just fears
If it happened, FOX news would deny it anyway
It's not technology which is good or bad - it's the intentions
@kurzgesagt on the wrong side of history
00:00 Biotechnology revolution and its potential for both good and bad 02:49 The rapid progress and accessibility of biotechnology 05:26 The potential dangers of biotechnology and the risk of a catastrophic pandemic 08:18 The importance of taking precautions and using biotechnology to triumph over pandemics
. . . somethings off here
Justifying V*ccines 🤦🏻 Finally, every good content creator on Social Media is ofcourse owned by 'them'.
7:26 - 7:27
You may make a mistake every  once in a while but your always in a hurry to correct it. I respect  you for all you do, and that just one of the things that set you apart from 99% if.... I was going to say YouTube but really the world.
wow "the hated one" youtube channel was right about kurzgesagt
JITP
7.26 - Kurzgesagt says ''among us '
allah! There is no god but He - the Living, The Self-subsisting, Eternal. No slumber can seize Him Nor Sleep. His are all things In the heavens and on earth. Who is there can intercede In His presence except As he permitteth? He knoweth What (appeareth to His creatures As) Before or After or Behind them. Nor shall they encompass Aught of his knowledge Except as He willeth. His throne doth extend Over the heavens And on earth, and He feeleth No fatigue in guarding And preserving them, For He is the Most High. The Supreme (in glory)." [Surah al-Baqarah 2: 255]
nice resident evil referance
Thank you Kurgy💖
Or we can just ban gain of function research....
Well at the rate of development of AI it can create deadly virus and wipeout humanity without use even noticing anything.
Thanks, I was looking for a new source of anxiety in my life
Another suspect video from Kurzgesagt
I'm glad you could admit the cringe but it still feels like a backhanded apology "we didn't realize you guys cared if things were factual", when you otherwise present yourself as a factual channel.
A Medicine spreading. This video is doing something, but not what we could!
The Corona virus vaccine was definitely not developed in a few short months - it was patented in the U.S. in 2017. You can look that up... I thought you folks researched these videos.
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!
I must say I seen a thing on YouTube and the guy says covid-19 was invented about 5 years ago with the sole purpose of making it into a a deadly germ and making sure that it was released on the public
What? It came from a lab you hack!! And the politicians who promised it’s effectiveness lied constantly, simple masks are basically useless and the deaths are not the result of only Covid but rather an inflated number. Vaccines are amazing for humanity but this is a BS report
😂😂 El maestro longaniza
4:46 batshit?
@Kurzgesagt - in a Nutshell : your kinda.. like i don't want to be dum but.. your a bit stupid the most power ful weapon is nature...
The most dangerous weapon is politician
We need another video on the darck matter
👍👍👍
Anyone played the Devision game from Tom clancy?  The story basically works on this principle.. We can't stop this from being a thing as anyone can buy DNA kits
Congratulations Kurzgesagt to 10 years on YouTube!!🎉
Ha. You lost me at climate change. I thought this was a science channel? And no one is debating that the Corona virus DIDN'T leak from the lab. It did. There is no debate. We knew it did in August of 2020. Where have you been? You're 0 for 2.
We want video on Xenobots please ❤❤❤❤
I don’t like the new kurzgesagt videos. The old videos are fun and creative. Now it is just boring.
Nice one
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. - Jurassic Park said it best.
Can you bring back intro
Everyone knows Corona virus came from a lab in China. You lost all credibility when you glossed over that and said it’s still “a matter of debate” no it’s not, stop spreading disinformation. 👋
please make a video about the excessive heat nowadays
You should do a video on how being a tick tock or YouTube contributor works
Gates foundation written all over this
3:49 star trek and sneeze
Para los que estan detras de kurzgesagt ahora ya pueden unificar el canal en el principal
3:48 OMG that umbrella corp lol
I think this raises of the question like 'If we keep on doing this, will we become weaker as the time goes?' I mean we are destroying anything that has potential harm to us and animals. I believe this wanes our competence of survival to bare minimum.
The next step to prevent pandemics like the C19 recent passed one is to not induce that much fear into peoples, cause fear is the worst in lowering the individuals imune system!!!! If the leaders REALLY want a safe society than it is time for the positive psihologic aspects...we must not be that over concern with anything...like this C19 passed more because peoples were bored about being into the fear seeing that over 95% of us were FINE FOR THOSE YEARS IN THE PASSING and combined with the rage uppon authoritys that kept building after the first year more and more by adding abusing facts of them uppon the general population...so is best not to be so sensitive on low and even medium importance bad outcoms rather than arriving in a point that you stop living for the fear of not loosing the life so ironichaly you just did it but in another manner!!!! In the end neither of us ultra rich, rich or poor and even broken, smart or stupid, sick or healthy, bad or good will exit this life alive and immortal...
If you want someone with a hippie perspective, lemme know. <3
I am from Africa and I appreciate kurzgesagt ....I only wish I could get your products
So we can test genomes and figure out vaccines but we can't figure out where the virus came from lol so advanced
This channel seems to have specific messages lately it's sad
😮😅well ingormeti0n good show 😅
science is the best
Tbh even if Resident Evil isn't mostly realistic with what they show It does kinda shows what kinda shit can happen when this stuff gets into the wrong hands No matter if Umbrella scientist, ex employee, regular people or even terrorists such as Veltro Yes I am deep into Resident Evil
The Human Genome Project was one of the basis for the development of neural networks, in other words, Artificial Intelligence. But I disagree that biotechnology is bad. It can eradicate diseases, especially genetic ones (once previously uncurable) forever. Biotechnology is not a sin, but rather, it is Human greed and lust for power. We saw this with China when the CCP had Li Wenliang arrested because he spilled the truth about the creation of COVID-19.
"Boths sides of the Yin and Yang" Everything as its balance. The greater the potencial for good, the greater the risk for bad.  Amazing explanation!
What would happen if the sun got right next to the Earth for like .0000000001 seconds and then just returned to its normal spot?
If we went extinct and the only evidence we ever existed was kurzgesagt merch, any aliens that came across it would probably get a pretty good understanding of us as a species..
You should make a video on AI
Hi
Can I please have a shadow it really helped my channel
6: 28 "a lot of effort has gone into making sure no radioactive material disappears from sight" EXCEPT the waste. The piles and piles of radioactive waste. At least we're not shooting barrels of it out at sea these days, but are we really doing any better?
Great job!
Que buen interrogante abre este video!!!  Me gustó.
Hello kurzgesagt, i just started watching rick and Morty and i fell in love with the idea of parallel universes so i watched veritasiums (may have spelt his name wrong) video about parallel universes. It was slightly difficult to understand, i thought it would be cool if you made a video explaining the maths/physics behind parallel universes.
why no eyballs this time?
the guy who teaches 69 times more than schools
#1 hurdle that humanity needs to over come is greed. There is no profit over a long time with a cure but there is in "treatment" I believe that there is cure for cancer, but big farma can't make money over a cure. Im excited and disappointed when new information is released because someone fill fond away to abuse it
Surprised so see no anti vaccine lunatics in the comments section 😂
Remember the milk episode Vegetarian not vegan beagle don't eat anything that is animal related vegetarians drink milk or eat eggs or other side products as animals but not the meet except fish please do not micks them up
7:25 among
Why you stopped making physics videos? I am really missing your physics content....... I only subscribed for physics videos, but its extremely sad that now you are not working on physics videos
Corona was a lab virus that got out, incase anyone still think it came from bats lol
Your videos are crazy
if you changed "bio" into "atom" or "nuclear" the video would make sense, just earlier in history.
SARS-CoV-2 was no mistake it was TERRORISTS attack
what's a Geneva convention?I don't go to thousand people meetings
i feel uncomfortable coming to these comments, they disappoint me, but probably offers different insights. idk.
When I started watching your channel I got better at science my first quarter grade is 81 at science then I watch your videos I got 81 to 91 thank you kursgesaqt for teaching me science biology astronomy BTW I'm on only grade 6 so don't expect Really good things
Full of misleading info. Making bio-weapon is not so easy as you make it appear, nor it will be in the near future, given the financial and regulatory constraints already in place for decades. Do your due diligence in research next time. Take my dislike.
What happened to this channel? It's bluepilling very hard. This video is full of false information. Well, it has been a good ride...before you sold your soul to Kill Gates. Time to unsubscribe.
very important Video
WE need a great reset
After suffering a horrible cold for 3 days I’m ready for the world to end
Kurzgesagt lost my trust because it's funded by Gates and other billionaires. propaganda channel
Covid
Hey what happened to the bird characters?!!!!!! That was your signature detail!
Please make a video talking about cordyceps fungus
Not a big fan of this kind of clickbait.. I’m disappointed
This video felt like a click bait cash in. Disappointing.
Love you guys! Thanks for all the knowledge :)
Side rant about dogs and bio engineering pugs are inhumane
Would it be legal to use bio science to make a person super human?
so we are playing god ?
(For all the comments saying how hard it's to get your hands on a deadly virus. Really think about it like this)   As for getting your hands on a deadly virus... you forget there is a way to do it. An easy way. Most terrorists live in poor countries with sub par healthcare. Like lets say a modified Malaria strain. Go find someone with Malaria and get samples. As for assuming terrorists lack funding or are always under-educated... true but going to a university with a gun is not that hard. Grab like 10 microbiologists and buy equipment.    I guess my point is Microbiologists like yourself are not experts in terrorism. Your argument is that it would be hard for terrorists to get supplies through legal means. Your right. But the bad part of your argument is terrorists won't order it online. They won't get a deadly virus online, they will find it. They won't study it themselves they will kidnap someone and threaten to blow their brains out if they don't work. They have funds, a lot of them massive funds. They can always steal equipment too from hospitals.
I’ll never stop saying it: biotech is the future and has more potential than any other science in existence. Sci-fi loves the idea of “nanomachines” but natural biology has already created the most sophisticated molecular machinery we could ever imagine. We just have to learn how to harness it while not destroying ourselves.
I am satisfied by this video
Doesn’t matter when China will lie either way about it all
I really love Kurzgesagt video <3
I like how every video in this channel is a tad hopeful but mostly "here's another way we're fucked and might go extinct"
Why is a UV lamp okay but UV light from the sun not?
Gonna make a video bout AI?
Anyone else catch the Resident Evil insignia on the building? Who else here a huge fan of that series as well as this lol
Make a hinglish language channel
Happy ten year anniversary🎉
It is really amazing video
A POSTER!!!! I do know that math wouldn't strictly qualify as science but are you working on math infographic posters? What is lacking? I want to be part of it!!!
Oh look, it’s knock off infographics
The first part sounds like the game Plague Inc.
I liked the part where he said "In a nutshell"
The Division
If it is bionuclear is not also nuclear....like wtf...
Are Kursesagt videos available in other languages?
Biologist will just tell you, "I don't track your guns, you don't track my viruses. Go away and let me play God," right before he accidentally creates SARS-CoV-3.
go on people, get creative, and build a virus that can actually end this world! can't wait for the new apocalypse era.
One of thoes viruses shut down the world for a couple years fairly recently
Heh....big words
When I was in the marines our CBRN instructor emphasized the danger of biological warfare. I remember he said "count yourselves lucky even the most insane dictators haven't deployed biological warfare against us and our allies yet. When that happens God have mercy on humanity."
I have to point out that I HAVENT SEEN ANY KURZGESAGT BIRD(Ads dont count), where are the BIRDS, Kurzgesagt without birds is human without soul.
This channel is absolutely amazing. They even admit their mistake in the end on the video and make it right. More power and content team kurzgesagt. Thank you ❤
This man has the most soothing voice and the most interesting videos
I really love kurzgesagt videos, but this one is giving me the "quantity > quality" vibes. reused animation, and the way the topic is convayed is a bit bland. hope the next one will be pure ducky!
a future where humans control biology is not a good thing, it has never been a good thing, humans have done nothing but destroy ourselves and other organisms ever since totalitarian agriculture took off
lucky for us only americans would release a bioweapon that would harm the whole earth (who's the only country to detonate nuclear bombs, and which country targeted civilian cities to be bombed?) and american children arent learning biotechnology lmfao they arent even allowed to learn real science in some states
what is the point of seeking out diseases that otherwise humans would never be exposed to and sharing with everyone how to create said disease? not all knowledge is worth pursuing
lt feels like climate change is breaking so many records like the New York air quality record and the most wildfires in Canada and making new Normals that would normally be records.
Thank you Kurzgesagt, for taking the feedback and being very clear about the grant and not making a (politically) wrong or misleading video of this serious topic, such as you did we climate change. No, free market won't fix climate change (big news, free market created climate change), such as free market can make the bio risk greater than it should be. Also, thank your for not using references that are not apparently align with the interests of your grant givers.
Thic video weng from neutral to really dark to light.
Day one of asking to make more space videos (Sorry if I sound ungrateful)
PLEASE TRANSLATE SUB IN FRENCH !
Please make a warp drive video🥹
Absolutely nobody should EVER be “tracked” just for studying genetics. If someone wants to investigate, say, the genetics of Covid, to pin down its origins, should the government that had it manufactured be able to know they’re investigating it and exactly where they are? Absolutely not. Because then governments could make viruses, put out propaganda calling it natural, and silence ANYONE trying to prove otherwise. Absolute hellworld type future
Getting easier for people to do in their own backyard? Bruh governments are, if you look through history, FAR more likely to irresponsibly, or just evilly, manufacture super viruses. The average person is FAR safer and more responsible than ANY first world government lmao
"Nuclear energy was born from weapon programmes, so its creators were always aware of the potential for their knowledge to be abused." Are you suggesting that they themselves weren't abusing this knowledge?
I'm really glad most of the people here are able to think for themselves and actually voicing concerns when they feel the videos are not up to mark. It's really disappointing that they would just throw out a word salad like that and not explain anything while making such wild claims.
Could you make another video in the style of "limits of humanity one", but exploring the Minkowski space-time in the context of objects moving relatively faster than the speed of light
Cut the shit. We know damn well were covid came from.
4:44 NEW BATSHIT VIRUS DISCOVERED Lmaooo Kurzgesagt like waat??
you have the most animation ever!!! pls do more vids.
I dont know how to explain it but the voice in this video sounds AI generated in a way
New Batshit virus discovered💀💀💀
There is a question i always wonder: how do they engineer virus and make new dna?
Very good video ☺️
out of realty. no words..
This video was kind of hard to watch. The last one was partially funded by Gates ventures and because of that connection, much of what you said in this video (sharing DNA info can be dangerous; we should regulate and track everyone who orders resources online; medical magazines are [too?] fast to publish new information etc) sounded like it strongly aligned with Bill Gates and his aggressive/restrictive IP beliefs. Wasn't he the one who specifically flew out to Oxford to convice Oxford/AstraZeneca, not to make their vaccine public domain but rather protect the IP, causing the vaccine to become an avenue for financial exploitation of the global south? He argued against making the information about the vaccine available globally for free, arguing for licensing fees on a life saving, crucial vaccine. Bill Gates, the man who proudly jokes about how he hoarded more PC-time at his School's Library back in the day than he should have been able to has become a behemoth against free use of information. This connection made the video a little bitter.
I'm quite sure that the cochlea implant is not "directly" connected to the brain just yet. It can replace some functions of the cochlea but it still requires the nerve cells of the cochlea to work. If there is a fault in the nerves between cochlea and brain, no implant can help you, you'll be deaf on that side.
covid 19 mRna vax was a wpn already gtg yrs ago.
bruh settle on the thumbnail
The vaccine was ready a decade ago. Not watching
There's no scientific debate about the lab leak conspiracy.  There are people who keep saying it's a lab leak but never present any evidence. That's it.
Interestingly, I read a book a decade ago that predict the ease of creating bio weapons. The author is actually very optimistic that, with unfretted power of mass destruction in the hands of everyone, our society will actually become a better place, because no tyrant will dare to oppress the people.
Their narrator are one of the best things that is happening to Kurzgesagt.
Oh knock it off. COVID came from a Chinese lab. The Left used COVID to control the masses and now they want to “move on,” as if their lies are forgivable.
yeaaaaahhh...no. they already HAD a stupid anti-viral medication gathering dust ever since SARS that dealt with the coronavirus type. I don't buy this "we're so awesome in biology" spiel
The best possible defense. KEEP PEOPLE WORKING AT HOME!!
Happy birthday kurzgesagt!
Call me dumb, I honestly thought that the most powerful weapon was the atomic bomb made my Robert Oppenheimer (I think that’s his name , correct me if I’m not right 😀)
<3 love this channel. The Birb will always be the word.
Awesome
"Stars Trek and Sneeze"
I love the reference to Umbrella Corporation.  Very nice :)
China created a bio weapon and Pfizer sold the pre made vaccine
You know who gave $150MM to Open Philanthropy?  Bill Gates.   This channel has become nothing but a propaganda piece for Bill.   Sucks.   It used to be good.
me who is scarying about bio weapons in 2.30 a.m. while having an exam at 8 a.m.. which I haven't studied yet 😱
This is how the T viruses was made
Ah, the duality of the universe, everything has it's uses, everything is balanced. Perfect like it's creator 😉
Could be candidate for great filter and a solution to fermi paradox.
It doesn’t cost as much as a new car, unless a new car costs less than $1000. I've bought kits online to do this kind of gene editing and kits to do gene isolation. It is really really cheap.  Also, it is false that Nuclear Energy was developed from Nuclear weapons. The first Nuclear Reactor was built in 1942, this was completed independently from the Manhattan Project.  Who the heck is checking your facts?
I like this channel. IT HURTS TO SEE HOW THEY'VE BECOME PLAGUED BY A POLITICAL AGENDA.
bro plzz using Indonesian language
Love the umbrella logo on bio building 😂
Kurzgesagt, i was wondering if you also publish posters through Displate?
Remember when Fauci funded Gain-Of-Function research at the Wuhan Lab leading to a lab leak, but he tried to cover it up by blaming it on bats at the market. It’s already been confirmed it was a lab leak and has identified patient zero who were two Chinese scientists at the Wuhan Lab. And yet, Fauci faces no repercussions for the spread of Covid.
I love you guys
Weird to see such intense technophobia coming from Kurzgesagt. The reason biotech is advancing at the pace that it is, and positively impacting millions, if not billions of people every day, is the culture of information sharing. If we lose that, then biotech will be completely dominated by large for-profit corporations, and the technology will no longer work for the people.
Huh
Kurzgesagt I got an idea on a video -{ Is their a way to break the building blocks of the universe  }- it would hypothesised how atoms or quarks can be broken in new way ( not including the usual like strange matter, or any normal things you talked of before ). I do have an idea fusing 2 atoms into one another or some crazy non fictional experiment which in the far far future we can see to believe.
So, we can do absolutely nothing against government-made pandemics. This is much worse than nuclear weaponry, because it is non-traceable, hence no Mutually Assured Destruction. You are free to kill all humanity except a chosen few and no one will know, unless you are not a government that controls the information.
With the planet warming we should be seeing more virulent virus coming down the pipe- which should be good. Oh, a note on Vaccine's- I ended up getting Covid 4 times as I was oldish and didn't really care. Everything hinged on getting vaccinated- but then the virus mutated rendering the vaccine= useless. I'm glad I never got it, waste of time. I just look at virus as a natural part of the living experience and if your time= kick it.
Humanity becoming cyborgs is the next step of evolution.
Thanks for teaching me how to create a fastspreading, fatal pandemic! I will end humanity with this knowledge. All I need now is some money... THIS VIDEO IS SPONSORED BY-
Who else thought that "DNA Discount" was a sponsor?
Kurzgesagt gained even more respect by owning their mistake. Great work as always.
06:49 UMBRELLA CORPORATION?! hell no! Run away!!! 🧟
Every new video from kurzgesagt give me a new fear to think of😹
“We’ve been successful” (comment on running nuclear power plants) Meanwhile russia on Zaporizhya nuclear power plant: 👁️👄👁️
A video on wim hoff method would be awesome
This is LITERALLY the storyline behind Adventure Time.  Mutagenic bombs change the world forever in an unrecognizable way.
C'mon, my farts aren't that bad

The Last of Us
I'm genuinely disappointed in this video, and I know I'm not alone in that. I didn't learn anything. I learned more from the comment section, where the people who work in this very field now have to take time out of their busy schedules to correct the claims made by one of the largest science communication channels on the platform. I understand that it's sponsored, and that a sponsor should have say in what a particular content creator can say during the sponsored segment of the video, but... C'mon. The amount of alarmist terminology here is saddening. This video stands in direct opposition to the views you guys took on things like CRISPR and GMO's. There's only one source in the bibliography that supports the claims being made about rogue bioengineers creating a deadly plague, regardless of intention, while the rest are merely the list of strides taken in the field in the past several decades. Are we to believe that The Thought Emporium is a threat to our safety? Most dangerous thing he's done when it comes to that field is when he created his own gene therapy to cure himself of lactose intolerance, and it worked. You can watch some cutting edge, previously thought to be science-fiction wizardry happen and he's doing it all in a personal lab. I'm not trying to advertise his channel, he's merely the one that's coming to mind. I know animation isn't cheap. I know salaries aren't cheap. I know things cost money and we all need it to operate within modern society. Honesty is free, though. Doesn't cost a dime. Even on some very dark and harrowing topics, like climate change, y'all showed that there's not one, but multiple lights at the end of the tunnel, that there's still hope to fix this problem before it becomes irreversible, and that there's real research going into them, even going so far as to acknowledge what many governments refuse to: that the efforts of regular people trying to minimize our carbon footprint isn't the answer. We should still do them, yes, but that it's not on the regular people to save the world on our own. Your whole schtick has been to present a REAL problem, break it down into its constituent parts, and then wrap it up with a message of hope that it can be solved. I'm failing to see the real problem you're presenting. The free exchange of information between members of the scientific community and anyone who wants to learn? That there aren't super complex bureaucratic hoops to jump through just to get base materials for an experiment, when every biotech worker in the comments says otherwise? Whole thing just feels really dishonest.
COVID leaking from a lab isn’t a conspiracy theory… and not even hotly debated. everyone knows that’s what happened idk why you guys refuse to admit it.
Om Shanti!
Why do i always think about different ways to control the world's population it's all bad for us .
So... covid.
Micheal Crichton would have loved this.
Is no body going to talk about the weird data guy before the start of the video
I respect your content and the amount of effort that is put in every video, kurzgesagt is the best space channel
Kurzgesagt is lovely :)
the previous pandemic was man made ...
What if all humans on the planet stop working?
I disagree with the premise that the knowledge should be controlled and limited. Why dont we go ahead and burn all the books that we think may contain dangerous information too?
2:03 If you think doing cutting edge science (in this case, NGS) experimental costs are "casual" for anyone normal, you are severely misinformed. Who are these "experts" you have been consulting?
2:20 What are your sources for the time frames? What are you even defining as the time it takes to "make cutting edge discoveries?" The experiments to get there? Or the time to peer reviewed publication? What's your example of 10 years for high school students? Jesus
1:55 When are you saying "then" was? Also, nothing major has changed in terms of automating DNA sequencing in the past 15 years. The sequencers are just higher throughout. What are you even saying takes those amounts of time? Just the sequencing or also the analysis? Nothing about it is "almost completely automated."  You really have no idea what you're talking about, huh?
1:00 No -- this was absolutely not "unthinkable" a decade ago. Who told you that? Do you actually know anything about the claims you make?
This should how politicians respond when people bombarded you with criticism. Kurzgesagt for the President!!!
Cool thanks
i disagree . everyone should be able to access anything but in safe controlled environment. you cant deny people access based on authority
When I thought chatbot was dangerous weapons
Tldr: Biotech tools may be cheap but you still need to know how to use it. It's easy to mess up and simply fail so it's unlikely the average person would succeed. I'm more concerned about Kurzgesagt's call to wall up information on biotech & genomes.   When I was a highschool student preparing for International Biology Olympiad 6-8 years ago, I experienced firsthand how easy it was to construct a makeshift biotech lab.  Our teachers brought stuff from the university and turned a hall in our dormitory into a makeshift lab. Of course there were no cleanroom or hazmat suits or those kind of things. They just put some machines on the table, kept the reagents / enzymes / DNA solutions in a household fridge, and stored other tools in the corner of the room (micropipettes & tips, microtubes, racks, etc).  We didn't deal with dangerous microbes nor genes, but I do recall doing DNA cleaving with enzymes (not crispr), PCR and electrophoresis.  There were other experiments of course (animal dissection, preparing microscopic slides out of plants, culturing bacteria & fungi, staining bacteria, etc...), but the biotech experiments were the most exciting.  Even though biotech tools, DNA & reagents have become cheaper but it doesn't mean you can conjure up a virus that easily. Properly using them needs particular knowledge, skill & finesse. A simple mistake could fail your whole experiment.  It's like sculpting statues: even with a hunk of marble, a hammer, chisels and knowledge of how a human looks, it is unlikely that the average person would be able to create a statue of decent quality. Even with access to budget biotech tools, reagents, and the virus genome, it is unlikely that the average person would be able to create that virus.  To me, the most alarming part is the call to wall up information on genomes & information on biotech. Much information in the science world is behind a paywall already and even us who were preparing to compete in an international olympiad often resorted to "third party services" to access the information (books & research papers) free of charge.
"Wherever the last pandemic came from"... goes on to explain in detail what likely happened with the last pandemic.
So, information is the viral threat.
Mlahhhhh the lab guys!
That little tune at the end should be a full song
Happy 10th birthday, Kurzgesagt!
What’s going on? Ask china as Covid OBVIOUSLY didn’t originate from their laB
Wherever these virus detectors report to, it needs to be a department that is very insulated from government executives. The potential for a repeat of snap lockdowns and other infringements is only heightened by such granular data if it is fed directly to the wrong politicians. We *REALLY* need to not let that happen ever again.
"Ready for testing"
Thanks now i know how to wipeout the entire human race if i felt like it
please do a video about ai
for once there are more humans than birds and for some reason the humans look different
Bad take. Information SHOULD be freely shared among humanity.
Thanks!!! Your great
Nice
It was really humble of you to accept you made a mistake, we all do but it's great to know you took a step further to make things right.
Where was the intro :(
Any nuclear weapon can destroy every shred of a virus/biological weapon. Nuclear is still king
6:43  *"Doctor Bombastic's Bomb Tutorial"*
so... In the future I can create the blacklite virus?
I'm sorry, BIO NUCLEAR IS A REAL THING!??!!?
We're still pretending anthropomorphic climate change is a thing and that the virus didn't come out of the Wuhan lab that was doing gain of function research on corona viruses?  Pathetic, Kurzgesagt.  ...absolutely pathetic.
80000 hours sounds extremely dystopian. On another note, is it rally philantropy if demographics data points can deviate from human at will?
What kind of lunatic wants such a world? Every trend is exponential, there's nothing viable about anything this species is doing.
👏👏
Goodway
1:28
"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today."
9 minutes of saying "people may or may not develope viruses at home in the future, because technology progresses".  Also the "info hazard" (another word for censorship) idea of just downloading genetic prints of viruses and creating them out of thin air is BS. This is more a scifi video than something scientific what Kurzgesagt was used to be known for.
among us 7:26
still milking the vaccine gimmik?
I found the video interesting, but information density could've been a little higher :)
Yeah, let's lock up the science knowledge so the entire world would have troubles accessing information when the next crysis hits!  Very proud of you, kurzversagt
Hello
It's my farts                 Sorry i had to, keep scrolling.
So... I'll shut up & be happy when the free exchange of ideas on the internet is restricted & censored so I can comply & get the next speed rushed vaccine.
Rio summit 92. Street people kidnapped, hid from view.  To save the earth our leaders met. Some had other secret plans...
The voice sounds like Cam Clarke  also known as Liquid Snake
bill gates already warning us abt next disaster thru kurzgesagt lol, get ready to be wiped off from planet earth.
Progress and technology are developing at a very, very fast pace.  On the one hand, this is very good, but on the other hand, not very good.  Thank you very much for this content, for interesting information and your work.
As we all know rival countries LOVE being transparent about their experiments and screw ups.
TL;DW we should regulate viruses, ~~such that no newcomers can come in and rival the businesses that fund Kurzgesagt.~~ such that we can save the children from a nuclear virus bomb!!1
Today kurzgesagt is now 10 years old which is pretty crazy so happy 10th anniversary!
Common kurzgesagt W
nice
This is so cool y’all are doing a great job
I hope no scientist slips with the worlds most dangerous virus and doesnt have any safety measures put in placr
I love existential dread
yeah.. I'm not too sure that publishing the data from studying viruses is a good choice. Specifically when it involves the public, i can just imagine some random kid trying it with his mom's credit card
Did anyone else got an ad from  *DATA TIME*
2311
This stuff really just gives me the creeps. We are more of a danger to ourselves than if we just let nature play out. All our meddling is what's creating more danger. Sure, there will be another pandemic that will kill millions, but there'll be a lot less of those if we stop meddling with biotech.
"It has the potential to be both in breathtaking ways" yeah, SARS certainly was breathtaking, making it hard to breeze…
According to my antivirus, I am safe and well-protected.
Great channel but get turned off by the propaganda on climate change & the virus/jab
Uh  You don't need to Buy RAW Bio materials They can come form Any were Even Very Local sources of other Bio Sources & UV-C DNA RNA Refinement  & Electrolysis
"Other labs go further and make the virus more dangerous" lol
I think this video is a bit sloppy for Kurzgesagt and you guys were eager and hasty to reach the end of the video. Arguments and the text which explains those arguments to us had a cheesy feeling. All in all, this particular video is substandard regarding Kurzgesagt quality.
kinda off topic but i would really love to see you guys do a video exclusively trying to explain that humans and all animals or even all living things are pretty much equally intelligent, and we should push for that to be the worldview we all share, as all animals deserve much more respect than we give them, even the "dumbest" one u can think of has something cool about it that maybe you dont see
👏
good video
WHERE IS THE KURZGESAGT INTRO???
I will always and forever love your self promotion part of your videos !!!
Maybe I should just unsubscribe because Kurzgesagt apparently keeps lying and misrepresenting everything without me knowing
Don't worry guys. They'll admit fault later and sell merch along with it
We should be very thankful that we have Kurzgesagt
Why do i get the feeling that the Great Filter is ahead of us???
Well, brand new car is still expensive. The only one who have these labs in their backyard would be a Americans or European.
Another opinion video from this channel written like it is facts. Makes you wonder how much cool aid they are selling in thier other video's (spoiler alert ALOT)
its because we love and trust this team wonderful people working together to make our rock a better place
I love your work as always. But a big L on changing the name of the video. We all know where covid came from and it wasn't nature.
Echo what someone else had said, its the first video i didnt like from you all. While it is positioned absolutely factually, this feels more alarmist than educational, inspiring or empowering.   Thank you for the resources to find out more.
7:26 is AMONG US.
Contact. Your. Representatives
Its unfortunate that for the first time i felt this topic was not well researched. You guys are better than this.  You made it seem as though one could buy a dna segment/ viral vector via a black market and not be noticed. Which is not true at all. Pretty disappointed with this videon
Is it really still subject to scientific debate? That covid 19 did or did not come from a lab? Come on.....
Wow...Even Kurz is an agent of the state these days. My disappointment is immeasurable
The end just left me speechless.  You all are truly the best.
you guys should make a show/series as a kids show, it would bring a lot of income and joy from people who want to learn, and watch these animations.
Covid pretty much definitely at this point did not originate in a lab. It's a version that has so little evidence going for it, but is still reiterated by media looking for an attention-grabbing headline, and pushed by politicians looking to blame China.
In Europe.. we all know who the real virus is..
this is more entertaining than most videos
Star Trek and sneeze
remember kids it wasn't us that made the coronavirus it was some white guy in a shed😉
Yeah... but to become a vaccine, the definition had to be changed. Reason being biotech is more restrictive than vaccine restrictions. Hence why it actually did nothing to prevent spread... which is the basic requirement of an actual vaccine.
7:24 When the virus is sus
Anthony Fauci
Happy birthday fellas, keep it up!
A huge thank you to the N.F. Gamaleya Lab for creating the first covid19 vaccine. ♥️♥️♥️🇷🇺
2:41 he really said crappy?
Where’d the intro go? :(
Very naive of you to think you can stifle the development of a supervirus by controlling and tracking purchases online. If I wanted a sample of rabies, I wouldn't try to order it online, I'd go to a cave and trap some bats. If I wanted a sample of the flu or covid 19, I would hardly need to do anything, it's all around. How are you going to track that?
Frank Herbert's "The White Plague"😬
What happened to your visuals and animations? This one looks as if your art director wasn't looking. Please, please, please don't cut quality and birds!
I miss the intro :(
I wish there was a poster of the evolution of science/tech. How we got from amber, to the first battery to electricity and then computers and smartphones. Most people know about the evolution theory, but most people don’t know the history and progress in science from ancient times to the modern age. There are still people that don’t “believe” in science but using a smartphone every day.🤯
Are they trying to subtly suggest that access to knowledge should no longer be free? LOL
See, any information or knowledge that is put behind a paywall or too regulated endangers humanity in another way - by cutting down on the progress being made in the field and all its potential good. Having said that, there is difference between access to information and knowledge, and access to actual equipment and material that allows a garage biologist to tinker with dangerous genetic material. I think a good mid-way compromise is to let the genetic material of plants and animals be shared freely but restrict that of microorganisms, especially those being studied for their fatality.
Those who claim to know everything, know nothing. Also humans are a virus.. the *worst* kind
>covid19 came from random bat from some small chinese market they told you this at the beginning, you need to remember that
This is the best YouTube channel in existence
7:25  you can't hide Among us memes from me
can't believe  been watching you guys for almost a decade
You should at some point talk about all the injuries cause by the covid vaccine and that there seem to be evidence that covid was lab creation.
Biden Was behind all of it!
i am in love with your animation
Love your videos ❤
This channel became propaganda
Controlling who can download the genetic code will not be beneficial really, it only will hinder innovation and research.
Where was the logo today?
In a Nutshell - my safe space
Pretty disappointing effort from Kuzgesagt. Lab leak is an evidence free conspiracy theory that is contrary to the basic zoonotic model of disease. Surprised to see you of all people both-sidesing basic science. Do you also think whether climate change is real or not is a "controversy"? Do better.
I'm about to be the best supervillain for Halloween
Did I spot Mr. DNA from Jurassic Park?
I'm not sure you can claim that a pandemic is more dangerous than nuclear war, but I suppose when you're taking money from the Gates Foundation and its subsidiaries, you gotta say what you gotta say.
this video just seems like fear mongering
How could human race evolve and be controlled naturally talking if we will be able to cure every disease with technology?
Or, we just stop messing around with viruses
chiming in with the other comments. this was not a good video
Liked when you said spicy. Would have liked anyway, that's just what got me 🤣
This was a really roundabout way of admitting the pandemic was man made and that we need to take WAY MORE precautions to prevent the next one
3:53 bro the first one was our fault. Thats what happens when gain of function research leaks, but the host country doesnt bother informing anyone
Every episode he's gotta mention climate change
what if you can build a nuke in your backyard  -Kurzgeagt 2023
I’ve been following your channel for years. However, this video is truly disappointing.
To the @Kurzgesagt team,  Your videos, posters, notebooks .. everything is amazing, beautiful, full of information. In this current academic/professional world, we do need to do/show a lot of presentations. Would you please make some PowerPoint/Word/Excel template to give our slides/documents a special touch and make it more appealing? I am ready to buy! Or also may be a wallpaper app? That would be so cool!
I received training and have worked in biotechnology and molecular genetics and I STRONGLY DISAGREE with your claims and conclusions in this video.  1. Free sharing and access to scientific data is a huge driver in discovery and collaboration. I would put it as number one reason we were able to pump out first Covid vaccines so quickly. And it is important to not limit access to this information to scientists as it lock out scientists from less developed countries, citizen scientists and increase distrust of general public with science.  2. It is very hard to get your hands on anything that can really be used for proper genetic engineering. In part current regulations also sometimes hurt scientists in poorer countries. But even in developed nations, there are tons of bureaucratic filters on ordering equipment and reagents and one would think twice before starting even an S1 lab (e.g. working with genetically modified organisms that pose no threat whatsoever) just because of all the pain and constant security audits you have to go through.  3. I do agree that the accessibility of these tools in research and especially education has increased. But that is only a good thing, it bridges the disconnect between the knowledge of fresh graduates and state-of-the-art in academic and industry research. I was so grateful we had opportunity to work with CRISPR-Cas9 in a student lab just 2 years after it was published.  Your video sound like someone trying to push tighter regulations to drown out competition through fear mongering. Very disappointing.
Hi guys ! Please support the writers strike. They need support against companies poor conditions. They need our help to earn a living wage, even tho media companies earned big profits during this time, their wages remained the same as many years ago.   Thank you for your understanding.
Nice Vidio! Can you make a video about the Alcubierre Warp Drive and the model by Eric Lenz?
Bros got 2 left hands? 5:10
Hey.. kurzgesagt team . Can you please do a meet and greet
Hey.. kurzgesagt team . Can you please do a meet and greet
Nice
Do you have a guide explaining each step along the way? For science ofc
Quite a bit of bullshit in this video
The last pandemic was man made... just saying
It's sad to see how this channel is just becoming cheap fearmongering to get more views. Half truths are more dangerous than lies, and lately you are being more and more irresponsible. You close the video with how you are researching more and you want to be more responsible with the information you share, and yet you are doing the same mistakes again. Science should not be guided by clickbait titles and or content. Be better.
Would you make a (Movie) please because I think your animation is good
hey if you're gonna read some scrip to get fund maybe do it more discreetly and less halfassery, sensationist headline and propagandist undertone is going to discredit your old work real quick
I miss the kurzgesagt videos before the pandemic. Most of them now feel less informative especially when it comes to biology, viruses and vaccines... They honestly smell like paid propaganda...
Covid made me feel special about the branches of biology I have picked - microbiology and molecular biology. With this video I feel even more like microbiology and molecular biology is the future. Who knows - one day I might be part of a team working to safe the world from bioterrorism 😃 Or maybe we will discover that most of the chronic diseases are preventable with microbiome interventions.
W vid, as always
The biggest threat to civilization Isn't climate change! It's humans!
Self replicating products made of dirt, water and sun? Which corporation would allow that?
Usually I quite like Kurzgesagt videos, but this was quite the alarmist one. The bit where they said that the Corona could be a laboratory virus that broke out was debunked for literally years, and the idea of a machine destroying pandemic virus is like saying that we could build a machine that can create food to every hungry person in the world, and just as valid. Quite the worrying video and a decline in quality; this Open Philanthropy should be an institution that we should be looking into it to see it's ideology and if it could have any connection with the alarmist nature of this video. The real reason to most problems with the last pandemic could be divided in lackluster testing, no investiment in base research and public healthcare and a polarized political background that undermined most of the effective handling, not someone handling with biochemistry in their backyard.
Please make a vdeo on hiv virus💀
7:26 👹📮📮📮📮
P R O P A G A N D A Muppets.
i argue gender ideology is the most dangerous weapon
gain a function  research really is playing with fire
This video felt like corporate shilling... I get you guys make big money from them, but you could at least be less sensationalist and more objective with your points.  Kinda feels like the mask has slipped since y'all were forced to defend your backers. I miss when I was naïve enough to eagerly lap up the knowledge you guys dispensed without question. At least the space videos still keep the old vibe! Here's to hoping for a bit of a turnaround...
Countries are currently developing weapons to attack certain ethnic groups. This is real life. Do not be afraid, but be aware.
4:44 the dreaded BATSHIT virus is discovered.
I literally just wstvh theses for fun !!
All this year's I'm thinking they already have a vaccine for every virus they published
The fact that your channel hasn't concluded that COVID came from the Wuhan lab is concerning.
I thought emp was the most powerful.
Umbrella corp
beautiful video
Yeah, this video was produced by Open Philanthropy. ie, they're getting paid to spew a bunch of biased nonsense.
The test tube almost rolling off the table killed me 💀💀💀
Reporting this video as misleading. Look through the comments and see how many professionals are telling you that what you're saying is bullshit. Extremely disappointed, Kurzgesagt.
I’m surprised how badly you guys bought into corona virus, I don’t realize you were that left wing !
anyone else got a really weird vibe off this vid?? it feels like a) it was produced really quickly, b) it just feels lacking the nuance kurzgesagt vids usually have? and a LOT of biotech personell are saying it's inaccurate
Gun
This video almost seemed scripted by a certain  pharmaceutical sponsor... Just my opinion lol
What an awful, awful video. Not like Kurzgesagt at all - switched off after halfway through and relieved to see many comments of the same vein
Those who saw this video with the title "next pandemic will be man-made" >>>>>
Lol, it would help if that "vaccine" even worked. 😆
I must say, Kurzgesagt publishing such a kind of video with a notable bias toward sources funded by their sponsor does give me a weird feeling. I've had the opinion that this channel's objectivity has been degrading for some time now, with these private foundations and philanthropies, owned by billionaires, sponsoring the channel.  I don't want to jump to conclusions by any means, but they could have at least mentioned that Open Philanthropy (the sponsor of this video) is investing $150M in an antiviral initiative, with $65M going toward the Gates Foundation (which also happens to sponsor this channel), before they started talking about people creating viruses in their backyard if we don't stop giving people open and affordable access to scientific information?? I wonder whose interest that is in.  Many people in the comments have also pointed out the amount of blatantly wrong information in this video, the unusual clickbaity title, and the shock this video is trying to induce.  Take the information provided in my comment as you want, and please make sure to fact-check what I said and what the video told you. But whatever this video is, it is not objective, scientifically accurate content, and that is disappointing!
For the record, anyone with a relatively strong undergraduate physics education and some engineering experience knows how to build a nuclear bomb, as well as most of the constituent parts, with relatively accessible materials. The obstacle to building one is that fuel enrichment requires infrastructure that is visible from space and will quickly get you in a lot of trouble. How to do any of that is not really a secret at all.
The bad massively outweighs the good. Risk humanity, or carry on as we do? Hmmmmm
The Crops supposed to survive climate change won't. It will get too bad. The planet will literally melt into magma, because of us, in the next millenium. Earth is dying, because of us. No matter what we do, it's already too late.
miracle crop that can grows miracle corn with miracle sugar that will blow you insulin to the roof so we can all die once we got old and not on a payroll anymore
4:45 Anyone notice that it says "Bats**t" virus?
This is insanely misleading and you should be ashamed of yourselves. Most legitimate experts are confident that covid originated in an animal, and then spread to humans. The rumors about it being cooked up in a lab are the direct result of racism, xenophobia, and conspiratorial disinformation. Even alluding to that in your video is fueling the tinfoil-hat morons who believe that this whole thing was either a hoax or a government conspiracy.
Humanity is so advanced at this point that the only thing we didn't do is hit the ''world anihilation'' button, which we are trying to decide wether to do it or not.
7:36 I'm not sure if they are saying a virus will arise from a volcanic pond? But it isn't possible for new life to arise on an already populated planet. It is new and simple and everything already here is quite evolved so the "new life" will just get eaten quickly.
Our biggest problem is folks that are so ignorant that they don't believe in science. Lol! Science is literally just an organized pursuit of knowledge about the world around us to understand how and why it works the way it does. Not believing in facts and rigorous studies is what is going to lead to our extinction moment.  Science should not have an ideology or agenda. Science does not have the ability to disprove God or religion and not should it. Likewise, any religion that rejects science is equally ignorant and arrogant. Dawkins and the evangelical americans share that arrogance and ignorance...   People need to get over themselves and just be open minded, think critically and be willing to admit they were once wrong, in order to embrace a more correct understanding of the world.
Covid is man made Hiv was man made Disliked due to propaganda for CCP/Big Pharma
I *STRONGLY* oppose the idea that the blueprints for how to create viruses should be restricted. If we're going to restrict the equipment (and that's a pretty big "if", mind you) then we should be *encouraging* the sharing of such blueprints with as much transparency and detail as possible, up to and including "laymen-terms" documentation so that as many people can understand it as possible.  That way, if/when such a man-made pandemic occurs, the scientific community could leverage crowdsourcing to assist with developing a solution, or very rapidly beef up its research teams from a larger pool of viral engineering amateur volunteers. Further, understanding the diseases that are to be combated is crucial to designing preventative measures and tools to combat such diseases ahead of time. It can even be useful in coming up with unexpected uses and breakaway advances in other fields, such as viruses/bacteria that could transform lead into gold for example. At the absolute LEAST, it helps to deny actual bad actors from hiding their bio-weapon research behind legally sanctioned red tape until it's too late.  Information restriction is to be avoided as much as possible.
I remember when EVE Online partnered with the Human Protein Atlas to "crowdsource" the categorization of millions of human proteins via a fun little pattern recognition mini game.  That was fun to be part of.
“You can tell a virologist is lying when they use the word ‘isolation’”
i thought the original title was better “the next pandemic will be man made”
yeah well the vaccine worked sooooo well didnt it 🤦‍♂️
This video would have been labeled disinformation two years ago, because it mentions the lab leak theory and gain of function research.
Once again you play around with the title/thumbnail of your videos in a very scummy way. I used to enjoy your videos, but they seem to have none of the original soul left in them, now being all about gathering as many views through clickbaits. I pity all the people out there who actually happen to take your videos, as of these past couple of years, seriously.
Is this about vx? the chemical weapon that only a handful of countries didn't sign a unanimous ban on, the Usa putting their stock pile of it on a boat out into the ocean and then sunk so they could get rid of it
I love these videos they're my favorite is anybody else addicted to this
"how to scare my audience to help the government get more power" you sad people are ok with 40% tax. Literally you are all wage slaves. Antlfa is proof you wont do anything and when you do... You are literally controlled, just like antlfa was.
Hey Kurzgesagt, bother to share any sources for this BS?
I may not have a brain gentleman, but I have an idea.
I love you’re video’s because it’s interesting to listen and animation is just wow
COVID19!!!
The only wonderful things for humanity all this automation is causing is a even higher level of inniquality and all those fancy technology is only for the people who are rich.
If there's a Great Filter, I'm pretty sure this is it honestly. I'm excited about all the useful implications of genetic manipulation, but also fairly confident it's going to backfire on us eventually.
This video is really cool!
no intro bruh
Mid
Yo kurzgesagt we need a “What is a virus, bacteria, and differences” video
Won’t using UV lamps to kill viruses give us all skin cancer…?
This vedio felt like a roller coaster 🎢 with my heart rate increasing then decreasing😂
Why change the thumbnail? The end of Kurzgesagt: Becoming corpo
Fuckin spook lol  You  only got a couple years mate before the shit hits the fan
That means you're still learning
Ugh your game cost 3:00 dollars
love your videos keep it and don't forget to take a break sometimes. :3
You STILL pretending it came from random spill over huh? Jesus Christ that's pathetic. The lab of ambiguous location and origin scrubbed its servers before anyone at the market even got sick. The Chinese CDC head warned of lab leaks in February of that same year due to poor safety protocols and the first confirmed patients were employees at the lab. It is 99.9% Certain covid 19 came from the Wuhan Institute for Virology specializing in novel coronoviruses in bats. You are idiots, political shills, or grifters trying not to alienate your US democratic viewers. The latter I can respect, the former 2,... I cannot. You've been a serious channel up until now. I remember you that way
The work from Alina Chan (MIT) leaves very few space for doubt. She explains it in her book: Viral. Covid is a clear derivation from RatG13 (bats), after an accidental escape in the labs from Wuhan. The evidence is not definitive, but it is clear enough to consider it the nearest explanation to the truth.
How the fuck have you not done a video on LLMs yet.
Well… that was garbage.
Does anybody else notice that there is no intro?
This is dope. But chill with the vaccine shit.
first time i've ever seen kurzgesagt swear in a video        4:42   "new batshit virus"
Kurzgesagt in a nutshell makes you paranoid, but in a fun way
This video felt weird, like it didn't discuss an interesting topic, but rather had an agenda. First time I have such a feeling about a kurzgesagt video
People are still dying from it.
I really hope that some day we can engineers a virus that would wipe out humanity. Really we don't derserve this planet it'll beter if we're all dead
This video seems not up to the quality standards of this channel. More fiction than science.  Yes the possibilities are endless but so far people mostly fail to do advanced science in there garages.
The video: serious and interesting 7:26: Among us
Considering the very large number of lab leaks that have been documented, reported, or hypothesized in the last several decades, there is a ONE HUNDRED PERCENT chance of another dangerous lab leak in the future.
I disagree
Uplifting...
The speed of scientific progress really makes him admire. Now people are capable of amazing things ... I would not want the joy that I live at this time to grow into regret about it. Although knowing the irresponsible and greedy nature of mankind, I feel that a good ending does not have much chance, but still they are. Let's believe in them.🙏
The process of using dangerous diseases as weapons, is called bio warfare, And it has been done in the past, but right now this process is almost illegal, Dangerous diseases are much cheaper than traditional ones,(since they can spread and multiply,while poisonous weapons deplete overtime), But this can lead to the death of the leading colonies(the technical term for people who have tended those diseases)as well as others, And this is one of the oldest ways people can murder entire populations of people,with just diseases(mainly airborne or ones from vectors,such as mosquitoes). And what ever you do,don’t do this please or you will regret it! And that’s why I(Ryan VD) like to call an infectious spreading time bomb.
6:49 Umbrella Corp..... 🧟‍♀️
So paywall it? 😊
So basically the next terrorist attack can be a virus instead of a bomb.
0:50 Narrator: "Our mastery of biology..." Video: _shows a pug_  This is why aliens won't visit us.
Changed title again ?
Ahhh, my monthly existential dread
I asked this question in the Veritasium channel.  Lets assume that we got some sort of perpetual motion, I think this mean that now we have an energy source( electricity ) to power almost everything and no need to be depending on the government or any anything that pose a thread to the use of electricity( or lots of electricity ). My question is does this cause problems like people now can do things that are previously hard to do like bad stuff and problems like lots of job less ness. And sudden collapse of certain country's economy because they are a major producer of raw material to generate electricity. What do you think would happen?  And I wanted to ask you too.
Umbrella! They created the Corona Virus. I knew it. :-D
This video is  The act of visiting a house that is in an uproar because the window glass of the house was broken by a baseball ball that flew from somewhere and saying, "Don't argue about such things, let's play baseball!" similar.   If the residents of the house accepted the invitation and really started playing baseball, who would benefit the most?  "I'm sure it's the batter who hit the home run."
Holy shit the fearmongering. It is orders of magnitude easier to create vaccines for viruses than to create viruses with specific traits. It's more likely that garage biotechs come up with solutions than it is for them to create problems. This is a good thing. Don't listen to this billionaire meat-riding channel.
I'm against witholding information from the public. I think all knowledge is a public right. The fact that we didnt die yet from such outbreak although this is happening generations already means that everyone that is kinda smart enough to manufacture stuff like this, also has sufficent lifepresurfing essence in them to not let it spread. Otherwise.... Well, humans are a plague anyway. I think the earth wouldnt mind many less of us. If I'm being honest, goverments just use it for their own win too. Otherwise, why would so many countries still have nucleair weapons? We all know how destructieve they are and yet we tend to make more of them.
The vaccine was ready months after the pandemic began because the virus was human made by the CCP to get Trump out of office since he was wrecking their economy with the trade war. Once the goal was achieved, they simply released the magic cure that ended up killing more people than the disease.
FYI, Open Philantropy is owned by George Soros’ think tank.
its a dangerous Virus
4:08 SPIDERMAN????????
the kid in 8:01 is gonna get a crispy tan
Now we need a video explaining what happened to Kurzgesagt. Sadly a formerly good channel seems to have fallen into the trap of sponsoring. Money makes the world go round seems more important to Kurzgesagt than still providing good content. What a shame!
You guys lost a sub from me on this one. It's painfully obvious that engagement and revenue matter more than education. Be better. This is misinformation.
You're fear mongering an area of research that you're saying we need to invest in so that we can prevent the thing you're fear mongering? You're eating your own tail.
sponsored by Bill Gates?
Stars Trek and Sneeze?
I’m glad the umbrella corporation logo.
A bit of fear mongering
Compelling evidence has always suggested Covid-19 came from the lab. It may still be "subject to scientific debate," but to say it just as likely may have jumped species in the same city is not telling the whole story.
We used to love watching your videos but the kids now feel like everything you put out now is “end of the world” scary…
10/10 for using the Umbrella logo for your biohazard lab.
im tired of channels changing the name of a video 3 days after they post it, so they can repost it and get more views.
I was low-key expecting a single source like: "We were told by Bill & Melinda gates foundation"
Kurzgesagt what what would happen if a standard USA quarter suddenly became as hot as the scenter of the sun?
Ahhh, The comfort of existential terror. Thank you science ❤️
Idea: Why don't you start your own online University? Backed by Scientists field experts and community??
Why would someone want to make a dangerous virus more dangerous
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
There’s no scientific debate on the origins of covid😂
Well...Time to finally unsuscribe from this fallen channel. Enjoy your money Kurz. May the system fail you like you failed us. More people are waking up everyday, and before even looking at your donors i could smell the shit miles away. I confirmed my doubts and you confirmed them again with more and more biased generic propaganda. Cya
"All the downsides of nuclear energy..." please list them. Disappointing honestly, didn't expect to see this kind of ridiculous unfounded bias in these videos.
Nice
no it's not. It's Avtomat Kalashnikov and its variants.
This video is complete garbage and a new low for Kurzgesagt, which is saying a lot. More censorship only makes it harder for watchdogs and if you read between the lines of Kurzgesagt's activism, I don't think this is an accident.
This is such a weird video. It feels so much emptier than most kurzgesagt videos I've watched. It's kind of just... off.
That's so one sided. No it's not scary,  the open sorcing of technology leads to further innovation. Open innovation is easy to fend off mad lads, also the odds of that happening is super small.
Thank you 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
4:45 everyone not noticing the name of the virus
Kurzgesagt, I’ve been missing the episode where you cover space. So I’ll give a video idea! Title: Time machines exist! (Spoiler: They’re telescopes!)  Idea: It takes time for light to travel, and light is the way we can see things right? For the sun, it takes 8 minutes to get to earth, so if the sun exploded we wouldn’t see it until 8 minutes later! It gets more interesting when you look further into space! You could be looking at stars that have already died or exploded! This is also the reason why it seems simpler the further you look into space! Because you are literally looking at the past! (this might be a bit complicated for a kurzgesagt video though I would love to see it!)
well now i know how i wont sleep tonight
This is a BAD video. Most people who work in biotech will not agree with "it's so easy to build a bio weapon in your backyard", not to mention still kind of pushing lab leak theory for COVID.
Thanks for the advice, I’ll test it out at my local Wendy’s
I’m screwed, truly screwed. Half my city screamed “COMMUNISM!!!” the second COVID-19 hit,  I live in rural Utah.
4:45 "Batshit Virus" lmao
How is a core of a star in a liquid state
Kursgesgadt just calling for censorship of science so major corporations can control the industry and make money off of peoples suffering, oh how the mighty fall
Hello,  do you make a video about '' Why cellphone don't work in water.''
Besides the bad video, notice how kurzgesagt put a swear word at 4:46 😆
Fack Vackzines!
As a biochemist working in biotech, I strongly disagree with this video in terms of overall tone and foundational claims.   Others have voiced similar opinions in other comments so I'll keep mine brief. The scientific community is already fighting a losing battle over the right to free dissemination of information against predatory publishing practices by greedy journals, and regulating scientific advancement into the ground would help no one. If anything, we need to be fighting to expand the access to information, not limit it.   This video feels like it's overly alarmist and the sources feel unfounded and weak. I'm genuinely disappointed to see this channel publish something like thisb
28 days later...
I spy with my little eye a Caterpie 🐛
Imagine though being the person whose job it is to mutate viruses to become more deadly
I feel like they were ALSO taking about AI without talking about mentioning AI.
respect
3:35 and 3:45 Two years you would have been called a conspiracy theorist for saying this haha
heey, I really love these videos, the animation and the way they explain things makes it very entertaining and therefore very fun to learn, thanks to all the people who work on this type of content :D  By the way, what is the animation technique? I have a homeworck in which I want to do something similar jsjsjs
There are definitely accessible ways to create homemade explosives with enough chemistry knowledge and that information is freely available in academic texts and other online sources. Access is restricted to many precursor chemicals in the same way that access to many harmful virus specimens or bacterial pathogens is.   This video is unnecessarily alarmist and misses many details of the buying process and the restrictions involved with purchasing these "at-home bioweapons" relying instead on shoddy sources and bad popular science writing. I used to really like this channel but feel now it's headed down the wrong path.
Just a "covid didn't come from a lab" ad. Thanks guys. I think you're more driven by big money with each video I watch from you.
I'm skeptical about the success in controlling our Natural environment with  the technology at our hands right now. Nature is extremely fine tuned and far to complex to understand for us as to make it work in a beneficial way displayed in this video.  We also do not understand ourselves well enough to know what tec or what invention exactly helps us long term. And which is more harmful then beneficial.
Loved the Umbrella Corp reference l, and i especially loved the Jurassic park DNA reference.
Regardless of intentions, I feel this video is misleading.   It’s certainly true that the information and tools required for biotech is more readily available than advanced nuclear physics, and its true that dangers exist, so I will start with that.   But it takes some real money, knowledge, and patience to intentionally OR unintentionally create a novel infectious pathogen in a biology lab.   We do still need to improve our methods of mitigating and containing exposure because industries that are accidental production grounds for pathogens such as livestock farming and hospitals continue to be a legitimate threat to public health.
Actually, the thing that’s more dangerous than viruses, are anti-vaxxers.
Y'all start to sound like conspiracy spreaders.
The breathtaking pun took my breath away
I was today years old when I realized Kurzgesagt was “in short” in german
wont we eventually get so good at dna designing that it wont matter if we lock up the dangerous designs, people will just be able to design them from scratch? admittedly that seems a while off bit still feasible
Kurzgesagt sucking off corporations go brrrr
8:05 Correct me if I'm an idiot, but isn't UV dangerous to skin?
Am I the only one that caught the "batshit" virus thing?
Where are the birds?!
How much is billy boy gates paying this team? Lol this is pure propaganda
6:49 Wait is this the Umbrella Corporation?  👀
This video seems to avoid the argument that if the spread of scientific knowledge is overly regulated, certain interest groups may elect to halt research and development in certain sectors completely. The issue is presented in a very one-sided manner and I suspect that this video was funded by a third party with a clear agenda.
I think the real risk is more like mismanagement of big corporations which have access, resources and license for such things (like how the flaw of Fukushima nuclear power plant was pointed out by an engineer 3-4 decades prior the accident, but the management decided to accept the risk on the ground that it was too expensive to rebuild  and fix). Note that for such thing never black and white, and the risk can never goes to zero, it is about how strict is the procedure (we accept 1 in a mllion years risk, or 1 in 1000 years risk etc). Even big corporations which used to have very high standard can become a bit lax due to cost cutting or profitabillity pressures (Boeing), in addition they might bribe, play politics  or influence those in power (through monetary incentives or other means (help with campaigns etc)). If such things become more and more accessible by wider corporations, then the regulations, and resources to implement them need to keep up. But yeah, the risk can be very high in some cases, beyond what we used to so far, for example, an entire city might be no longer habitable  (not just a few planes went down ). But also though, the benefits (which we have already enjoyed), assuming we can continue managing the risk properly, has been and will always be life changing, it can be said that our survival depends on how we keep progressing on this front (food supply, pollution (plastic, air water), climate change, cure for disease and prevention etc)
Humans with this power are like a baby with a gun it will  kill itsef in the right corcumstances -(me a scientist)
4:11 Nice reference to the new spiderman movie
You know, with each video you use more and more fearmongering. I think it's time to unsubscribe.
Something is very off about this video.
Since I first learned of the existence of CRISPR, I’m convinced civilized society will end as a result of some gene editing dude in a basement with a grudge against the world.
Great job, I like your shows
I love most of Kurzgesagt merch, and have bought many for my kids rooms, but your world poster needs to be redone in something other than the hopelessly inaccurate, and lets face it, racist mercator projection.
Punishing: Gray Raven lore intensifies
Is this the plausible deniability video? "Far right extremist creates next pandemic, no biotech companies or government agencies were involved and any claim to the contrary is anti-science"
what do you mean we don't know where corona came from the US government said itself that it's been admitted that a chinese lab made it
Kurzgesagt is slowly getting more alarmist. This video fuels conspiracy theories and talks about the spread of scientific research as if it is a bad thing. When Kurzgesagt received criticism months ago about their funding sources and conflict of interests, I thought they were in the clear, and that the critics were nitpicking. Now I am not so sure, as there honestly does seem to be an agenda behind these videos.   I miss their old style of purely scientific and educational videos. The trend in modern media is to post sensationalist and alarmist content for higher engagement, but this is evidently at the cost of the population's mental health and well-being, constantly being fed negative content. I do not wish to see one of my favourite channels fall down the same path.
Ah yes the "next" one will be man made
as always amazing video thank you
Stupid video. As if anyone will be able to stop the next plague before we get plagued by it.
The most dangerous weapon is actually F.E.A.R
I like you you just have 2 people underneath big uv lamps. Well worth getting cooked alive to avoid getting a cold.
i have a weak eye sight i pray i dont get blind if any doctor or scientist reading this... WE CARE about you all. do better for the ones you love and love you 🤓
Kurzgesagt thank you for the app you created im grateful for all of the information it has give and keep up the art style its fantastic!👍👍
You should really go for the idea of a misinformation apocalypse due to the current evolving General Artificial Intelligence. That'd be fun to watch.
Drink a shot everytime kurz changes its video title
We know it was a lab leak, nobody with two brain cells to rub together buys the "Bat market" nonsense.
Who are Open Philanthropy, and what is their agenda?  This seems a strange topic to fund.
2:31  Kurzgesagt does not mention that apple makes in nearly impossible to do that with their products as they wont sell you parts without signing an nda to be apart of their independent repair program.   there are many longstanding issues with apple as well regarding design issues that have not been fixed, limiting cable data speeds if you are not using "genuine apple" c cords, or disabling face id if you dont if you replace a part that does not have a serial number tied to that device.
Guys this Spanish Latinamerica subtitles is not for this video but the video called  " The Reason Why Cancer is so Hard to Beat "
I adore you
Hey, does anyone know any further reading into the use of bacteria in prosthetics? I couldn't find it in the sources. @kurzgesagt am I missing something? Thanks!
what would happen if we nuked the sun?
Very disappointed in your characterization of the origins of sars-cov-2 in this video. By showing the spillover on equal footing as a lab leak ''theory'', you make it seem like they are equal chance. Any actual evidence available indicates a probably spillover event, like which happens all the time. The lab leak idea presents no actual data and is less likely. Your quick gloss over of this does a disservice to those watching and who are unfamiliar with the likelihoods. Please correct this.
Still on Bill Pedo GAtes pay roll.
Good thing I'm studying biotechnology. B)
can you please change the scope of topics you make videos about
If china isn't finished, they gonna k"ll us all fs with their bio weapons and evil agendas, like conquering peaceful countries like taiwan, vietnam, nepal, india. They alr have honk kong, tibet and others under their illegal control
I thought this post was originally named: the next pandemic will be man made
I enjoy the videos, but giving examples from media made virus is a bit childish for this channel.
It would be great if you can do a video about acupuncture and its scientific progress nowdays
this feels like a really weird Kurzgesagt video. Very strange, and by far not as enjoyable as most others from this channel imo.
_"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made"_  The last pandemic was man made....
Last one was man made as well
Except the last pandemic was man made as well
at some point some scientist is gonna upload how to make a zombie virus at home
The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made - you're saying like the last one wasn't :))
Kurzgesat alway gives me hope for humanities future... than explayns how we can destroy the world by breathing
Interesting!!!
This is the one odd video where @kurzgesagt got it wrong. There are so many issues to object to. The next pandemic will not be manmade, this title is as horrible as it is false. The next pandemic will be a zoonotic one, same as the last. The origins of SARS-CoV-2 are not scientifically disputed any more; there is an emerging consensus behind zoonosis based on a detailed body of evidence. The weight of evidence is not only entirely one-sided, it also contradicts, disputes or debunks all plausible lab leak scenarios. Not staying up to date on the science surrounding this controversial topic is really, really bad and the impact of this video will be quite unethical. It creates a false balance between a legitimate scientific hypothesis and a harmful conspiracy myth that has harmed scientists, strained geopolitical relations, and sabotaged pandemic prevention efforts. Nobody says biosafety is not important, but it does not stop at the lab door. The risk of another pandemic coming from spillover is tens of thousands of times more likely for the next years; and even further in the future, when biotech becomes more ubiquitous, it is unclear when lab accidents or bioweapons will pose a higher risk than nature. Next, relying on Kevin Esvelt who is at best a media-savvy contrarian for information and your thrust of the story is so lazy I can hardly believe this reflects kurzgesagt research on this topic. I interviewed dozens of experts in virology, emergent diseases, biosafety and nobody takes Esvelt seriously. Another point to raise is the conflict of interest of Open Philanthrophy, which is an ideological arm of the TRESCREAL cult sponsored by billionaires who rather distract from their misdeeds of the day by marketing a self-serving vision of a future they are creating. If you are not knowing what I am talking about, maybe something to look into. Overall, the biggest issue with this video is not that it get the facts wrong (some they do), but that it got them so decontextualized and put in a framing that is a big distortion on the overall topic, which is pandemic prevention. The real solutions are not about "reigning" in some scientists, but way more complex than that, including addressing the ways we ravage nature and deforestation, the economic incentives of wildlife trade and wildlife smuggling, the lack of any biosafety on too many animal-human interfaces, from cave tourism to hunting to wildlife markets to backyard and factory farming. All this video did, like so much media around this topic before, is to seed suspicions and distrust about science and scientists in the general public, while presenting them a red herring for pandemic prevention that takes away oxygen from the real lessons and actions required that should have been implemented by now. As an enormous fan of kurzgesagt, having seen this video that is within my expertise getting it soo wrong is really disappointing.
DId this channel forget 2020 existed?
The next one huh? Because the previous one definitely wasn't man made lmao
Sounds like a good plan that if the resources become available,  everybody should be taught how to handle a simple culture sampling, do so any time they get sick, then report the findings to an automated database. Would it be vulnerable to arbitrary manipulation? Absolutely; as vulnerable as a fire alarm. So don't set it off recklessly.
So was the last one. What's the big deal?
oh you mean like the last one?:)))
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "NEXT" ???
the last pandemic (cv-19) was lab made !!!
"next pandemic will be man made" as if this one wasn't :D fking sellouts
Actually, it is not that easy to build something that is deadly. Some bacterias work well in the ICU against the best antibacterials, but imagine this: Bacteria:" Hey,that ugly stinky thingy has his left foot in the lab first.I shall die."
What do you mean "the next pandemic will be man-made"... like the last one wasn't?!
Citing the Coronavirus vaccine as an example of faster development is a bit of a stretch... Most of the ground work was already done before the release of it, it is a man made virus after all 🙄
Wasnt the previous  pandemic man made?
Well corona is man made? what's your point?
yes, just like the last one
already done. Covid was man-made in a lab in China.
Like the last one??
The last pandemic was man made, so I guess your right, virologists need to stay employable somehow.
the last one was tho
Modern human society is really just society being *HARD carried* by science 🧪 and globalisation 🌍, while the rest of society's institutions 🏛 rot 🤢.
the last pandemic was man made..................
kurzgesagt, I urge you to look more into who 80,000 hours and EA are, and who they have been funded by and associated with. I know they seem well intentioned at the surface level, but I feel like I have reasons for skepticism against them. All I am asking you here is to do your own due dilligence thoroughly.
This video feels off. It doesn't seem as authentic as usual kurzgesagt. Seems to just promote big companies gatekeeping information and also MAKE MORE VACCINES. As if that saved us the last 3 years. (it most definitely did not).
people have the right to not be injected with vaccines, even if the eventual outcome is millions dying, rights are inalienable.  and because people vary, there will always be some who choose not to be vaccinated, and thats ok.  dont impose your values on them.
Aku takut ada orang yang berpikir "manusia sangat bersalah karena merusak bumi. Manusia harus dimusnahkan dari bumi untuk kesehatan bumi"
Taking a piece of ice from Antartica and mutating ut
Zombie breakout will coming soon
Why would you tell millions of people how to do this?
This pandemin was man made
¨we create¨ this ¨we might do¨ that. uh seems like a campain to throw the responsability of very little people on to the entire world
all viruses are handmade
This video lost me at , " we still don't know if coronavirus was from a bat or a lab leak" really? STFU
3:37 Really? I thought this was a serious channel, not a conspiracy theory one 😓.
turns out theres a lot that we can do: all of us just need to wear one of those yellow suits from breaking bad while science makes them more comfortable and ventilated and SMARTAH, finally we all just need to buy an ApPel Vishon PROH and we all just gonna live in the metaverse forevah
In a nutshell: We're screwed.
The last pandemic was man made.
Dude, the last pandemic was man made…
This video feels off... Like the usual bird and their antics are gone, the humans are faceless and animated in a more generic less expressive way etc.  I really like your stuff usually, but this video felt very odd  Edit: Also the bibliography is weird, seeing as many of the sources are connected to the sponsor
4:45 look at the bottom of the top book
@4:45 "new batshit virus discovered" lolololol
1:23 you really wanted to do the swastica aint you :D?
Kurzgesagt more like propagandesagt
7:26 Amongus
What do you mean “the next one”?
The next one? The current one already was
in your video Why Don't We Shoot Nuclear Waste Into Space? there were an estimated 440 active nuclear reactors and now (6:35) it's 411, how did this happen? great video BTW, love your work.
The animation has gotten so much better recently woah
The last pandemic was Manmade . I love this channel , but this time you're late on news.
Still,my concern is global warning
The battle against the silent PANDEMIC HIV is where I'm waiting..cancer and other INCURABLE DISEASES LIKE STDs and harmful organisms that kill our crops.i want my bananas😅😂😂
Covid 19 was made in China
It it was unpleasantly surprising to see how Kurzgesagt fearmongers, I expected better of them. 1. Governments don't use nuclear weapons because of heavy consequences that would follow and due to its non-selective nature. Imagine them using weapons that are even more non-selective and not bound by blast radius, spreading rapidly.  2. Terrorists can just brake in at a medical storage and contaminate IV bags with HIV, it doesn't require biology degree. Also, no one stops them from spreading existing deadly viruses, like Swine influenza, plagues etc.
The previous pandemic was man made too.
Did you change the name and thumbnail for this video? Why?
the previous pandemic was man made
the next!! the last one was!!
This is not a good video and is basically clickbait and scaremongering.
"Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made" The next pandemic will be created by AI. It will be the last one..
As was the last one.
Lab leak is what happened with COVID. The pandemic we all lived through was man made.
2 and 3? sure 1 = no Do not create obstacles to scientific advancements. We need those new tecnologies for yesterday!
@kurzgesagt GOOD VID
the last pandemic was man made
Make video on butterflies🦋🦋❤
u guys are such cuties
All pandemics are now man made. It is just a matter of having the right activator. Microbiology. Very dangerous. A simple catalyst will drop the masses.
It was china 🇨🇳
You sound like the narrator of peppa pig😂😂😂
7:26 WHERE???????
3:32 No. We do know. It was a random mutation. Not a lab leak.   The gene sequences of bat affecting corona virus are nearly identical to human affecting viruses with only a few random alterations to the spike proteins allowing them to bind to human ACE-2 receptors. This indicates a likelyhood of prolonged exposure to infected bats who have a myriad of diseases that took an opportunist approach to a new host.  A lab version would have obvious signs of tampering, large swaths of code completly different from what was present in the natural virus code for example. In addition a lab made virus to affect humans that had viable viral RNA inside it could only ever make sense as a deliberate bio-weapon. Much like nuclear weapons that have extremely deliberate, precise engineering and physisics requirements to function, a virus has extremely precise requirements for viable gene mutations and protein binding, anything less than wouldn't be viable.  Any lab serious about developing such a thing would never release it without first making it as deadly as possible as well as a vaccine to use as leverage and a safe guard for themselves.  That isn't what SARS-COV 19 is like.   A natural virus rarely has high lethality as too much lethality inhibits contagiousness. Instead natural viruses like high infectivity and low lethality to promote lots of infections and longevity for the virus, which is what SARS‐COV 19 does.  6:57 NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT, we don't need censorship or the thought police. We should assume the information is spreading freely already among evil people already and spread it as freely as possible among ourselves to aid in development of technology relating to detection and destruction of viruses.
5:33 When you say "we're creating an environment in which it's increasingly easy for anyone to create a weaponized virus in their backyard, this is scary", that's missing the forest for a tree: that we're in fact creating an environment in which it's increasingly easy for anyone to access goal enabling knowledge and capability in ANY domain. As individual capability increases thanks to exponential progress and wealth distribution in all domains, the implications are very uncomfortable: Short of a draconian and authoritarian control and alignment dystopia, the risks associated with the freedom of individuals able to command the scientific outcomes of a Kardashev Type I civilization might be a great filter candidate.
How was the COVID-19 not man made? Literally out a lab in China.
The last pandemic was manmade.....im gonna eventually unsubscibe from this propagandist channel
corona was also man made by chinese labs
Covid 19 was man made!
So this channel is now control by CCP , WOW
lol this past "pandemic" was also man made
everyone knows covid19 was created in a lab. yet somehow that is a more racist idea than the pc take which is backawater chinese savages ate some bat soup 😅
The last pandemic was man made
I couldn't help notice that one of the "tools" you used as an example closely resembled the Chinese street disinfecting crews and lock-down drones telling people to "Stay Home"! Do  you really think violating people's liberty is a legitimate "tool"?
The last pandemic was man made tho
2:32 Apple: NO. BUY A NEW ONE.
Yes man made. like the last one
A cool video would be how life may have started on earth!
5:06 don’t bring those precious Nintendo Switch Joy-cons into this!
5:06 what do Nintendo Switch Joy-cons have to do with this?
The last pandemic was man made lol
The next pandemic?
Brought to you by Phiser
Yes, because the last pandemic was DEFINITELY natural and coincidental.
There is some omega-level tinfoil-hatting going on this comments section lol
Umm… the last “pandemic” was man made… wake the fuck up
So was the last one
The last one was already man made.
My favorite part of the more existential crisis type videos you post is that theres always a "okay, but what can we do about it?" section at the end to soothe the oncoming nightmares and existential panic
Fauci & China created COVID-19
this felt...off
While this video is not in Kurzgesagts normal wheelhouse,  seems most commenters are overlooking the exponential nature of biotechnology. The fearmongering stems from the simple fact that we can expect these technologies to continue increasing in power while falling drastically in price. Think about 30 years of progress in biotech like they mentioned - the reading of the human genome from billions to $1000. Now think about another 30 years... I think its reasonable to say that the ability to generate and manipulate genetic material will be widely accessible. Last, think about how long it takes public institutions to take action (unless there is literally a viral threat threatening our existence and way of life). Probably better to not wait until that point because we all saw how that turned out the first time around. Pretty straightforward precautions if you ask me...
The last one was.
I was in Shanghai during their horribly mishandled and mismanaged lockdown last year. 8:16 really triggered me. It's like a scene directly out of Shanghai during that time.
This video should be subtitled: the last pandemic was man made
We are doomed
Wait did they add a Resident evil reference? 💀
So the infested from warframe
where was the intro?
So - Kurzgesagt lives long enough to see themselves become the villain..
Oh right, like the last one..
Just a reminder that COVID19 was man made and alot of people who got the jab became gender confused
JUST LIKE THE LAST PANDEMIC.
ඞා
The "Next" one will be?
This episode kinda feels like a miss No intro? No birds? And the message feels really hamfisted Hopefully you bounce back for the next episode!
What were the odds of two consecutive manmade pandemics?  Pretty good actually, when many of the richest people on Earth are Malthusians and Marxists, none of whom have a sturdy moral fiber.
BANANA
What happend to all the ducks?
Plz do a video on solar storm that will cause lack of internet access for months or years and it's future
Kurzgesagt has gone woke. And now, hopefully, will go broke.
The last pandemic was man made, so this checks out
"Unknown coronavirus" bruh it is literally the title of this video, interesting to note this doesn't have the youtube "context" garbage on it. Very interesting.
As apposed to the last pandemic?
This channel is so creepily weird. 20 mil subs ????  Looks like a giant psy-op ...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH   excuse me  ahem...            AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Crazy how fast 1 bad video can damage your credibility
The last pandemic was man made...
What do you mean the next ?? Isn't Covid man-made ??
nothing about this video feels right  animation quality is poor as many others have pointed out, they're basically using a single source not elaborating on things (come on. Making a virus in your backyard? Bullshit)   WAS THERE EVEN A SINGLE BURB IN THIS VIDEO!? Where's the life? The quality? The counter arguments? This isn't a Kurzgesagt video. This is just a soulless corporate film
Gates Foundation is like "damn, everyone's on to us, let's just give this info into the hands of teenagers and hope they do our job for us so we can wipe our hands clean"
Current one might also be man made actually.. just saying.
The last pandemic was also caused by a lab leak.
You folks are funded by the Gates foundation. that makes me worried. i'll bet your solution will be more govt control and monitoring of civilians, their search history, and their speech rights.
what do you mean "the next one"? The last one already was.
So it seems everyone agrees this video is kind of a joke. Very dissapointing, I had a lot of respect for kurzgesagt before this.
next like in addition to the last one?
your analogy of fix-it shops building iphones is ignoring the fact that apple is a horrible evil corporation that would rather kill then allow their intellectual property to be free
The next
Everytime this channel posts a medical-related video:  Huum.. Did Bill Gates pay them to do this?
Just like the last one
The origins of the Novel Coronavirus as a natural virus are not scientifically ‘up for debate’. It’s genome has being confirmed as wild.   The only place this is up for debate is amongst conspiracy theorists, politicians, and media outlets.   If it did somehow arrive from a lab it would have had to have escaped prior to being altered. Which, granted, is a possibility. But a much smaller possibility than initial infection happening in a wet meat market with dozens of wild species in cages on top of each other.
Is it just me or was this video describing the current pandemic?  😂
The *last pandemic was man made.
Next?
Yeah, sure, the NEXT pandemic.
The next will be?
4:46 batshit
Lab leak already happened bruh
Looks like this one was drawn up by Open Philanthropy.  (March 14, 2022) – Today, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, Open Philanthropy, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced an initial commitment of up to $90 million of coordinated funding toward Pandemic Antiviral Discovery (PAD), a new initiative to catalyze discovery and early development of antiviral medicines for future pandemics. With equitable access as a core principle of the initiative, the founding partners are committed to ensuring that discoveries and innovations supported by PAD are accessible to people in low- and middle-income countries.  Stands to reason these people are going to profit from this kind of media
You guys are the best I love the effort and the dedication you put in all you do ❤ Sorry for bad english but i really wanted to thank you all for everything you do for us
The first pandemic was man made!
COVID was man made. By china. Has this account been bought out already? Yes! Bill gates owns the show now so we’ll never get the old videos like we use too. Typical typical
This video is quite dystopian in its styling
The last pandemic WAS man made
Coughs and sneezes spread diseases - so maybe make these 2 as publically unacceptable as, I dunno, farting - or allowing a ringtone during a string quartet? Just sayin'.
mmmm tasty illumanti pre-programming, not even the same animation style, atmosphere or goals as the other videos.
So are we gonna ignore that thing that just happened that was definitely a man made virus
"the next pandemic will be man made" ... you meant to say that the last one was most likely a lab leak too right?
the first one was man made - covid!!!!
If you're interested in a story about a world where everyone with a garage had access to genetic information then I'd like to recommend Genocide Man, a webcomic that ran from 2010 to 2016. It's good stuff.
Who can say if the last one wasn't man made KURZGESAGT?
The red arrow in the thumbnail is the clear sign you guys are just sellouts. There goes my sub ➡️🏃🏻🏃🏻
Making a nuke is not that hard, getting the stuff for it is
Implying COVID wasn't a lab leak?
More like "The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made Too"
Funny, last pandemic was also man made ;)
compare the recent comments to the highlighted ones and you can see the channel admin conducts a lot of censorship.
open philanthropy, who paid for this video to be made, sloshes funds back and forth with the likes of the bill and melinda gates foundation. To those unaware this is a scratch my back and i'll scratch yours tax evasion technique of the ultra rich posing as philanthropists.
Just like covid lmfao
Isn't it already confirmed that the previous pandemic was from a lab?
The last pendemic was also man made, in Wuhan Institute of Virology. Funded by Gates years before its outbreak. But the propaganda was too strong for the sheeps to realise sadly.
@3:40  Kurzgesagt, if this ends up being settled sufficiently to your own standards, do you plan to speak to it at that point?
The last pandemic already was though
you are assuming that the last pandemic wasn't already man made.
This channel still sponsored by Bill gates?
the pandemic we just got out of was man-made…. like what? 😭😭😭
So, when cat girl?
The LAST pandemic was man made ffs
This video didn’t age well
The thumbnail is dangerously anti-science and the content is not much better. The benefits in disease treatment we’ve seen far outweigh the threat and it’s not as simple as backyard science. As a molecular neuroscientist working against regulations to make progress, I’m sad to see my favorite science communicator promoting poorly thought out content. Also if you ask me it’s going to be a climate derived virus not lab.
How do you think Covid was created China, plain and simple
4 years too late.
Isn't steril environments one of the big factors in the rise of allergies?
Wasn't patient zero on covid 19 found and wasn't he a researcher from the wuhan lab?
The current pandemic was man made, sorry you've jumped the shark, stop peddling bullshit...
This video feels off. Kurzgesagt has been getting a lot of criticism for their funding and this video is proving the critics right. I also dislike the clickbait in the title & thumbnail. This is not the science and education channel 20 million people subscribed to. This is an infographic show explaining some ideas of wealthy individuals that aren't based in science. In essence this video is at best terrible/poorly researched and at worst propaganda. Needless to say that I have lost a lot of respect and trust for Kurzgesagt. I hope they address the situation and take this video down.
Deliberate release.
The last pandemic was man made! Pharma Industrial Complex tried to hide their safety data for 75 YEARS. Imagine that, "I'll tell you how safe I was in making X...in 75 years" People were lied to and philanthropists and Mega Corps made bank off the lies!
Last pandemic was man made what are you guys on about
This video is 100% propaganda,  Chinese or US made you do it?
Sort of interesting all the people commenting saying that this is alarmist and "not how it works." Sort of sounds like when Russia repeatedly denied it was invading its neighbors and then finally we found out they were lying. After the coronavirus I have trouble trusting any of these supposed authorities. I'm also not alone so it's going to be a long road before people trust anything they hear from someone who says "trust the science"
Am I the only one noticing this video didn’t have an intro?
wo sind die deutschen kommentare? oh and i don't think covid was man made 😑🤦
The next one?!  😂
So was the last one…
Viral of medical journology is a very funny way of portraying the current state of Journal's names
Bizarre and alarmist video, also probably not the best sources when its from the people paying for the video..
2030
The Covid pandemic was man made. USA sponsored the Wuhan lab. They let the virus out.
WOAHHH!! Someone fact check lol. The corona virus was not unknown. It has been studied since the mid 60s... And the vaccine was worked on by big pharma since 2017. Over 2 years before the first case. You guys should make a better effort to verify your info, or perhaps you do not care.?
"As a non-scientist, I feel my opinion about science matters more than scientists'." - Nearly half of the human population, 2020.
Considering Covid19 has been officially confirmed to be a lab leak from Wuhan China laboratory. Yeah the next pandemic viral outbreak will definitely be human made again.
Basically, what happened with COVID.
This video sort of assumes and implies that the latest pandemic was not man-made. I don’t like ignorance of truth. And feigned ignorance toward the unknown is almost just as bad.
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made"... the last one was already.
Very clickbaot like. I cant imagine viruses being that easy to create, of so ething would have happend by now. This does seem a tad sketchy tbh...
Booooooo! Hard pass on censorship
The last one was man made..
The last one pandemic was also man made, though released by an accident
Sigh, do better or mark this as entertainment, possibly Hollywood script writing practice. /shame
This is pretty nakedly one or more biotech corporations using a charity to promote regulations that would entrench existing monopolies on biotech by making market entry as difficult and onerous as possible. The nuclear comparison is ridiculous because the nuclear research was directly state controlled and the information is actually quite readily available today - there is already a glut of oversized biotech corporations that are beholden to shareholders and owners and not people, which means any current attempt to "regulate the information" is at best foolhardy and at worst an active attempt to stifle innovation for profit.  This might be the single worst video this channel has ever produced. You should be ashamed of yourselves.
Covid 19 was leaked from China's whu han lab.
U sure it hasnt happened yet??
Rebuttal: The next pandemic will be AI made.
Umbrella reference, we love it ❤
As if the first one wasn't!🤔
Kurzgesagt great vid keep up the hardwork and hope u make a video covering how the universe will end
“The next pandemic will be man made” Me- oh this video in my recommended must be before 2020 My face when it’s three days ago - :/
the last pandemic was a lab leak too
3:38 I'm sure if you consult the archives of any major newspaper at the time, you'll find definitely-stated assurances that there was no possible way that the virus could have originated in any lab, and that anyone who believes otherwise is a scientifically ignorant cretin.
Covid was too. Its "forbiden" to talk about it but i believe that china is responsible. Im not an antivax or anticovid or whateva. I just think its obvious
Weird merch? Yeah, I don't know how I feel about looking at lice for the whole month of July 😅
First outbreak in Resident Evil: 1998 Outbreak that turns us into the Resident Evil universe: 2028
Guys, the LAST pandemic was lab made, no need to talk about the “next” one. What a sad shill this channel has turned into.
Uh, Kurzgesagt, the last pandemic was already manmade. Thanks Winnie the Ping!
I thought it was common knowledge that the last pandemic was in fact, man made?
I think the last one was man made😅
The next pandemic? You meant to say the last one surely.
The next pandemic will be man made? Oh, just like the last one, got it...
What a weird and super disappointing video from Kurzgesagt. I love the existential dread videos you all give me, but I like the research behind those videos. This isn't the same. With 20 million followers, you're doing a disservice by spreading bad science infomation for a donator.
As if that's any diff from the last?
Remember back a little over a decade ago how we had committees and councils with REAL POWER that were put in place to RESTRICT GAIN OF FUNCTION RESEARCH?  Remember back a little under a decade ago how we removed all power from those councils and committees making them "advisory" rather than "security"?  Interesting times.  "What could possibly go wrong?"
Tell me how you really feel with that title
The last one was, just no-one wants to admit to the mess up and it’s messed everyone up.
LIke the last one
Taking money from Bill gates kills any credibility they ever had.
The next?
the next pandemic... cough cough
u meant to say that covid-19 was
Please, do tell me how it is possible that a mere purchase of concentrated hydrogen peroxide must be reported to the police (at least in my country) and dangerous virus DNA is exchanged freely?  For those unkwnoun, it happens hydrogen peroxide can be either a boss at killing microorganisms in a desionizer and also an explosive precursor.
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made" just like the last one.....
It already happened with Covid
Forget about nuclear, countries are able to wipe us out in a day with the types of things they play with. Its already here and probably enough to kill us 1000x over. Bio weapons are worse than nukes and put a hold on nukes for some but not this stuff. So crazy, do not be scared of a nuke.
If kurzgesagt cared about the science, they would have communicated that a zoonosis is by far the more likely cause of the SARS CoV-2 outbreak -- wet markets not being known for their bio safety -- but instead they went with the sensationalist false equivalence of "that's still subject to scientific debate" that fit with their theme. Of course, fear and outrage gets more attention than being honest... My take on this video: kurzgesagt sold out.
Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?
❤
This smells more like an ordinary promotion video than anything else. I expected much better to be honest. 0:40 gen therapy creates cures? Convenient how you left out the _fact_ that its use is also *banned* (by law) in dozens of countries because of the potential risks.
so just like the last one? got it
The last pandemic was man made lol
If anyone thinks this is the first biased / agenda-pushing "philantropy" that Kurzgesagt has paired with, consider other previous sponsors of the channel such as G*orge S*ros and Google.
The LAST pandemic was man made. Not saying it was intentionally released, but it's dumb to not think that the gain of function research is responsible for this.
Hmmm... they may have messed with the wrong birbs...
Stop it! It absolutely came from a lab leak. So so so much evidence to that has been shown.
The last ‘pandemic’ was already man made
Yes.. the next one will..
The next one????
This pandemic is already madmade though lol
Lol the "NEXT" haha.
Umbrella corporation hiding our beloved birds😢.
Monkeypox and Sars-Cov-2 costs $563 online
A friend of mine wants to know how to make a bomb in a backyard, anyone knows?
unpopular oppinion... the last pandemic was already mam made.
Wonderful and it good  I like it
The next pandemic will be man made? The last pandemic was man made.
Did you really just give credence to the lab leak theory? Really?   Sure, we don't know for certain, just like we don't know for certain that the Kurzgesagt narrator is not an alien in a human suit, but we can make a good guess at how likely it is. Are you going to spout any old nonsense for sponsorship money?
So… like the last one?
Why is everyone hating on this video, I think people trust society way too much.
We need a vid that's just a tour of the bird treehouse sometime!
As a YouTube commenter, this was a video.  However, as a certified jackass, this video could use more sex appeal.
The last pandemic was man made.
The last pandemic was also man made.
The last one was man-made.
First is crowd control and money remember that
Nice Conspiracy Theory.
Yeah this video was a bit off than your other ones... Would love to know why.
Why not the last one…?
The last pandemic was man-made too!
What is going on with this video? The style is way more alarmist than your usual content and it seems like you're almost shaming the free spreading of data which is pretty fucked up.
What do you mean by the NEXT?
Real cat girls are able to be made we just lack the funding
Yeah that won’t happen until 2120
Covid was a lab leak from China. They were conducting gain of function research and the virus escaped the lab.
THE FAKIN LAST PANDEMIC WAS MAN MADE... I thought you guys where smart
Multiple organizations investigating this have determined that the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome has not been altered by genetic engineering. Also, the scientists who got sick tested negative for antibodies in February 2020, meaning they never had Covid. This in mind, lab leak is an extremely unlikely scenario. Source: science mag
Nobody gonna talk about how the coronavirus was created by a US funded laboratory in China. And Moderna was contracted by the government to create a vaccine in 2017
ISIS watching this video getting ideas.
that subtle Resident Evil ester egg ❤
This feels propaganda-ish.
Get a Maksutov 127 + old Canon D1000 and a suitable alt-az mount. You'll get better results and it will cost you far less.
The last pandemic was man made..
The last pendemic was man made
This time, it’s gonna be mental and much worse than any physical calamities.
I hope when I grow up I can create air-born cancer
The last pandemic was man made
the last pandemic was man made
The last "Pandemic" was man made as well
The next? Unlike the previous? He
the virus wasn’t new and the vaccine was shit
China will destroy this world doing this shit
I keep telling people, WE LIVE IN THE FUTURE! the modern era ended at Y2K (meaning that I am not native to the modern era)
Where were the 🐦 🐦 🐦 ??? Slightly worried now 😅
The last Pandemic was man made. So makes sense the next will be too.
First one already was
The last pandemic was man made.
I can't tell what the truth is. On one hand kurzgesagt usually makes well researched videos. I feel there are some valid points about deadly viruses being a info hazard.  The comments seem to say a completely different thing. That this video is anti-free information and that deadly virus info is already tracked.   So i really dont know.  I do know that when the geneic code for COVID-19 was found its was basically publicly released so everyone could develop a vaccine.  Maybe thats what started this idea? Either way video does feel different.
I hope that kurzgesagt knows that if there is a pandemic in the next 20 years, conspiracy theorists are going to point to this video and the channels connection to bill and melinda gates and lose their shit
The LAST one WAS man made! 🤦🏻‍♂️
As was the most recent one 🤷
Open delivery terminal or something in INDIA guys! I so want to buy these products that you make!
I've always enjoyed these videos and have been a fan for a while, but that Umbrella corporation reference sealed the deal.
This video is a few years too late. They've already created and accidentally released a virus upon the world.
What do u mean by next. The Wuhan virus is also manmade. Patient zero was one of 3 scientists in the Wuhan lab.  They got infected in November 2019.
Wher intro
What happened to the channel that told me uplifting things about the universe?
oh look, man-made horrors beyond my comprehension
Really strange and alarmist video, Kurzgesagt. Not sure what to take away from this one, just telling us to wait for someone to build some sort-of "machine that would stop any single pandemic from happening" seems way too convenient for the amount of drama you put into this vid.
Two videos in a row funded by billionnaires and appear to be obviously pushing their propaganda. I'm now unsubscribed, such a shame that this channel seems to have been compromised by their filthy money.
"The next pandemic will be man made."  Wait till they find out about COVID...
This video has ruined my view of this chanel
The first one was… why would the next one not be?
The previous one was also greedy ass garbage maggot made
I love your immune system book!! I really want you to create another book but this time let talk about space, star , planet, technology, alien, overall space!!!!!
Lol I love the umbrella resident evil little reference at 6:48
Unsure If the virus came from a bat or a lab leak? LOL
The last pandemic was man made
Covid 19 WAS man made
Sometimes it is important to say the unpopular thing. Please do not backtrack this video Kurzgesagt. It is an important risk to consider.
Next... sure next... well we always are a day late and a dollar short.
Psyduck 5:04
bro we don’t have to wait for the next one. Covid was manufactured by man in a lab and was “leaked”
It should be called the bio revolution
Title change
The last pandemic was made by humans
How can you have an outro talking about how much being scientifically inaccurate "hurt" while the exact same video has a title claiming to see the future and is chocked full of unscientific speculation and fear mongering?
the last one was
as if the first one wasnt😁😁
So this channel is now all for limiting access to information to the population they deem worthy of it....interesting.
Patient 0 was a Wuhan lab scientist… @kurzgesagt how is it supposedly not clear according to “science” what the origin of the Covid-19 virus was?
Sure, we can create our own pandemics easier, but the speed at which we can create vaccines is also getting even better. Right now we have to create a vaccine based on something we discover just now. In the future we already have a full list of possible virussen and their matching vaccines. A virus variant will be known before it ever existed.
Animation is much worse on this one
You know which other pandemic was man made? 😮
Yes, Its going to happen again cues we let china get away with it twice now. 3rd time is the charm
Why you change title and thumbnail, the old one was so good :( Edit: the old one is back ;)
You can tell when ya boi gates wants to gatekeep
The real threat of the next pandemic is that a large portion of the population will actively try to spread the virus because they deny it even exists.
Pretty sure the last pandemic was man made 🤨
Ironic since the last pandemic was man made as well...
Wait, the last pandemic wasn't man-made?
Kurzgesagt has been falling off for a while now. This is just one more example
This last pandemic was man made
So what about Corona virus leaking from a lab in Wuhan?
I like how Covid went from 100% never heard of before virus from out of know where!!! To " Oh yeah its a coroniavirus hybred that we patented years ago and ran simulation for its release in the public."  Weird.
Next?
Covid=man made
The same people who claim that the 2020 bug is still debatable if it was made in a lab are the same people who claim that world will end in 5 years from cow farts.
Some would say this already happenned 😂
This feels like propaganda. There are many saying the same thing in the comment section so I won’t go into detail but this does not feel like a normal Kurzgesagt video. It also doesn’t address the VERY plausible theory that the Corona virus was itself, man made. Not saying that it is or is not but the title of this video would suggest that it wasn’t. It is also advocating for restrictions on information and knowledge. The whole thing seems like it was made to spread propaganda.
This video should have come out in 2018
The animation sucks, keep it simple man 🤦🏻‍♀️
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made" ... well, umm.. the last/recent one most likely was too lol
This video seems kind of irresponsible they make this seem far easier to do than it is and ignore controls and regulations about this type of research. They also ignore that a far greater problem with science is the LACK of it. It’s far more likely to have dangerous viruses arise from nature and the only way to help deal with those is to sample and be ready. So this video basically scaring people against doing science is actually far more dangerous
The next pandemic will be man made? Bruh the last one seems like it already beat you to it.
This video doesn’t feel like the usual. Not a fan of how the animation has changed nor am I a fan of the alarmist tone. Feels more the content of a conspiracy doomsday scenario video meant for clicks rather than inform. The works of our scientists have been put in mostly a negative light. Isn’t this channel meant to promote scientific discovery and spark interest in everyday people? Why is it now telling us we should fear science and technology? This isn’t what Kurzgesagt used to make, please return to inspiring and informing rather than the scaring and exaggerating in this video.  Also, EVEN if COVID19 had been man-made, it isn’t right to give off the message that humanity can, and will do it again. It is incredibly difficult to do things mentioned in this video secretly without being put on a watch list.  (I don’t work in research but I can’t imagine those who do would be allowed to just do whatever they want freely without any supervision or documentation)  Edit: Several people have been replying to comments with the rough message that China is out after us all. To anyone who has posted a comment reinforcing the idea that China is evil and an enemy, instead of focusing on your pre-existing hatred for the country, remember the people within it are probably not that different from those in your country. We should be discussing how to better our world using our technology rather than fear what can be made. Just like how we use science to make vaccines, new medicines and new materials, they also are. Micro aggressions are not welcome here. What good will prejudice and fear do for our world? Science should bring out new possibilities that unite us all regardless of politics and ethnic backgrounds or culture. We shouldn’t fear technology, only use what we find and discover as tools to build a better future
covid19 was engineered by people. The last pandemic was man made too.
So was the last one.
I love this channel
This is pure inPhographic show BS
AD before video ❤
Anyone else notice this video felt different than their usual vids?....must just be me
hmm...like the previous pandemic wasn't man made?
The previous pandemic was man made.
COVID was man made,made by Americans, pharmaceuticals earned lots of money, who do you think was the big winner in this pandemic, not anyone but pharmaceuticals. They do whatever to earn money.
"What if you could build a nuclear bomb in your backyard" really got me thinking. Im very optimistic about new tech, but i also recently looked into a lot of true crime and more than ever realised how messed up some humans are. This is really scary stuff.
The last was also man made...
No birds? ☹️☹️☹️
7:15 Has China sponsored this video?
The last one already was
Nothing has terrified me more than learning how *easy* it is to make highly dangerous materials at home. Whether that be a new virus, a buttload of thermite, or even a nuclear bomb. The most dangerous person alive today is a curious individual with just enough knowledge to start a project that will quickly get out of hand.
The last pandemic was man made.
The last pandemic was also man made 😂
The last one*
Gene therapy has been promised for 20 years it's very expensive, unlikely to become routine  "Libmeldy®, has a list price of £2.8 million"

7:26 among us
Lmfao, "unknown corona virus"😂 wtf is this?
dude..... who the fxxk said that the whole industry is cheap?????!! It is hella expensive to purify, assemble, buy the primers, custom made restriction enzymes, and storing all of that??  Just because gene sequencing has been made cheap, doesn't mean that all of the processes for making rDNA virus or bacteria is cheap. it's comparing like how LED bulbs being cheaper to telling how cars are gonna be cheaper too! or comparing now that high school student can play and make sensor based machines, the cost of huge electronics are falling down. you get what it mean?? Gene sequencing is just a component / step in biotech.  And there are so many regulations.... So many that you start viewing routine inspections and auditing as just another day for just bsl2. And the the culture collection centres which only allow specific strains only when the r&d manager/head or the HOD's approval, if the laboratory you are working under clears the requirements for the biosafety level needed for that appropriate strain, and give a detailed report on why you need that particular strain.
isn't that the Star Trek thing? they are not allowed to show advanced technology to undeveloped societies. they have to grow at their own pase, going too fast will destroy them, because as in the video is said, anything can be weaponised.
How's that propaganda funding working out?
See, THAT'S why you lose credibility  once you get money from bill gates
Already happend lol
kurzgesagt: BIOTECH IS BECOMING CHEAP!! NO REGULATIONS AT ALL ME a undergrad biotech student: *crying in misery as our reknown uni can't get all the equipment and bypass the restrictions needed to teach us the virology elective course and animal cell culture paper, had been forced to take the fxxking agriculture/ plant/ industrial paper instead again.*
The first pandemic was man made
Yea, the "next" pandemic will be manmade....
So was the last one. 😏
Wtf? The next one? COVID WAS MAN MADE. Is this video made in 2019? If not, get with it. Wtf. Losers.
Who the fuck funded this
The last one was man-made as well.
The last DEM-PANIC (i.e., the china virus DEM-PANIC) was Man-Made!  So, why wouldn't the next DEM-PANIC be Man-Made?
Si pembuat penawarlah yg membikin penyakit sebenarnya
You mean "The Current Pandemic is Man Made"?
The last one was man made…
Holy crap 😱. Kurzg sold out to China. We know the "virus" is man made, it is not really up for debate, and something about this video and way it cited sources was very off putting. 🤔 Im shocked. 😳
This sounds like some "effective altruism" style BS scaremongering. Advocating that we DONT openly share scientific discoveries is not a take id think id hear from Kurzgesagt. I knew when they started taking money from big charities and billionaires foundations the channel would slip
Yeah, like the previous one was totally a natural occurrence.... gtfo
me after reading the title - like it wasn't already 💀💀💀
The NEXT pandemic? Covid-19 was already man made.
Long time subscriber until this video. Thank you, bye.
LUL, the last (present) pandemic was man-made.
considering all the things kurzgesagt says it’s obvious their time travellers now looking at this video i am scared
well.. not agree with delay. we already have a delay protocols in other things.. that i still see in hands of ramdon people... so.. delay is dump
what the hell happened to kerzgessgt?
A nice soft introduction to the concept to ease the facts about the last one.
In Metal Gear Solid V, they tease a parasite that targets spoken language. The villain tries to eliminate English, they language he was forced to use:
Wasn't the last one already?
The last one was too
"next" :)
next pandemic? xd
"The unknown Coronavirus" wow you guys have fallen
The question is, how do they know what's going to come next? So is this a plan by government??
Somethings really wrong in this video. No face, no birds, and the topic and thumbnail are really badly direct as if forcefully making you click it. Kurzgesagt never does this. they are trying to tell us something more deep in this video....?
Thanks kurzgesagt, now we're jonna have to worry even more about bioterrorists😂
Covid itself was man-made.
Do you have a political bias?
From the bible Said All of God creations are all Good!!! Why you blame bats a animals. The virus is a man made Bio weapons.
5:20 i think this may be the 'great filter'. The more technology advances, the easier it is for nefarious actors to use that technology to do extinction-level damage
Lab leak theory confirmed now comes  gates funded propaganda mouthpiece spewing garbage
The last pandemic was, of course the next will be too.
So many red flags, do NOT listen to this video 🟥
I'm definitely noticing that that's a recurring theme with Kurzgesagt videos; getting people's attention with something super scary or existential crisis-inducing, and then ending the video with "yeah but actually, you really don't have to worry that much".
It's kinda funny that I literally explained that shit to my family just 1 year ago because they said stupid stuff like "it took 20 years to make a vaccine 40 years ago" and I was like "40 years ago a computer was as big as a room and not even as strong as a modern calculator". They just couldn't fathom that we improved that much in 40 years lol.
lol
Wow amazing...can't wait this gets effective for the average citizen in 💯-200 years...😂😂👌
Sponsored be Philanthropists. Essentially like saying sponsored by corporations. Philanthropy is a corrupted corporate field.
Rare kurzgesgat L
This is already happening and has been for a long time lol. This is essentially just a fear mongering piece
this one was also  lab one
Channel keeps getting more sus
What do you mean "next". Duh
Yea just like the last one.................
The covid pandemic was man made😂 gain of function research banned in the states done at the wuhan institute of virology conveniently down the street of the apparent fish market it originated from. WHO refused to report an in depth investigation on the origins its all a fucking fraud
Kurzgesagt is like “We UnDeReStImAtEd ThAt YoU tAkE EvErYtHiNg We PuT OuT iNtO tHe WoRlD SeRiOuSlY.” (9:30) this translates into “we thought we could get away with spreading misinformation.”  Which is what they’re doing with the title of this video. No one can know where the next pandemic will come from.
Wherever the concept of restricted information is introduced, the politian's income and army expenses immediately become one.
Seriously, the animation of recent videos are worse than the pandemic
The next one?
I think its alway did, about the covid-19 i follow the Laboratory  Theory
After that 3:30 nonsense about the virus potentially having come from a lab, I was so disappointed. Kurzgesagt, you've put out so many wonderful videos over the years. Why is it only now that I'm seeing you straddle the line between far-right conspiracy and facts?  I bought stuff from your website. I now feel disappointed in myself for having done so. Please, don't let this be the future direction you and all of your wonderful artistic people take.
The COVID 19 virus was man made. I thought that should e obvious but people clearly dont look into things they just repeat things
What a great predictive programming video. I'm sure the elite whom are planning to reduce world population through silent genocide will be able to fool the public into thinking the next pandemics were made by someone in their backyard and not a funded gov project. ☕
next? The last one was already
Correction*** the last pandemic was a lab leak
The next pandemic???? What about the last one.
I loved Kurzgesagt. I enjoyed being educated. But i was dumb still. In our world there is not only "listening attentively". There is "knowing who zou dealing with" as well. Thank you for your time. I wish u some kind of success and even more money from ngos and fat foundings. Let the cash flow. Bye.
Why change the title?
Unsubscribing, this video feels off. Its like sponsored propaganda. This channel has changed.
Can't we just kill all bats and monkeys? They seem to be the issue.
Literally covid-19, it’s not the next one it was this one that we jus went threw
Let's make sure it's gonna on 2120. Let's make this a century like basis. A classic event in humanity
Anyone who's lived long enough to feel colds and flus already knows this covid pandemic was man made anyway. You can feel it.
I thought the first one was, in a Wuhan lab I am led to believe!!
first Kurzgesagt video where i cant legit watch; this feels like a agenda by Open Philanthropy instead of the cool world-ending Kurzgesagt videos i know of
Well thank god, we’re already having trouble with nuclear and atomic weapons, so it’s nice to know that bio-weapons are basically just being prevented before they even exist  Also I can just research biology in a backyard? Why didn’t anyone tell me about this?
See y’all in 2030
I'm pretty sure the last one was. It just so happen to spring up right next to a lab with the same name.
Curiosity kills the cat (indeed). But, satisfaction brought it back (hopefully).
5this video was made possible through
A more correct title would have been:  The Next Pandemic will *ALSO* be man made.  Covid came from a wuhan lab where they were doing gain of function research. Most notably: how to change the infection vector (i.e. how to spread it). The did not intend to have the virus escape, but they let it, and ever since have been blaming everybody but themselves(i.e. China).  This guarantees that they don't learn and it will happen again.
unsubscribed
Covid 19 was probably created in a chinese lab
I have your Map of Evolution and I just love it! I was so happy to save up for it and finally have it on my wall :)
if only academy wasnt such a hostile environment
>next
I think the last one was too
As a cancer research biologist, the way this video denounces free sharing of research and information is really disappointing. Bad job on this one guys
Not very impressed with this video 🫤
As far as I know, the last pandemic was also man-made. Let's not conceal or distort the truth. ❤
NEVER FORGET, The CCP SHUT DOWN ALL DOMESTIC FLIGHTS in & out of Wuhan to try and prevent spreading Covid in their own country But LET ALL INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS CONTINUE 24/7 for months!!! They could of contained it in Wuhan & the world would of helped them in every way but  they knowingly,  willingly & purposely chose to infect the entire world with this horrible virus (that came from a Lab)!!! It's irrelevant whether it was accidentally released or purposely released, the CCP's actions afterward say it all!!!!
Well the kast pandemic was objectively man-made, not even a doubt
"Next"
2:52 what is the person in black doing?
To say the very least about this video is man is always going to be subject to its destructive nature-either we accidentally or purposefully create a disease that wipes many of us off of the earth. It’s pretty inevitable, given nature did it with no cost…man is extremely clumsy and incapable of being responsible enough to control the power of life biologically. It’s horrendous to think the character of modern man has the ability to control life on such a fundamental level.
Nothing new there
the last pandemic was man made….
What do you mean the 'next'? We already had it!
I know what I have to do, but I’m not sure if I’m strong enough to do it
I think the last pandemic was man made :/
The last one was already a man made lab leak
This video is really…..odd, considering the usual high quality and actual scientific information this channel is known for. Making a pronouncement like “the next pandemic *will* be manmade is a pretty major claim to be making.  Despite virus research we haven’t had a man-made pandemic yet (doesn’t mean we can’t have one in the future, just that lab accidents thus far have only resulted in very localized events)  Don’t ignore how truly terrifying nature can be and how rapidly it can throw something at us that we just ignore until it’s too late (yo, look at H5N1 and what is being said about it all around the globe right now, how it’s being found in places never seen before and has adapted to spread between mammals, and how quickly it’s moving)  The equipment and materials talked about is not that easy to get nor is it easy to stay under everyone’s radar while procuring it (as other people have said, that stuff is tracked like crazy)  Making big claims like this on such shaky ground as this video is on risks masking real potential problems.  Something really strange is going on with this video.
Yay
Как всегда информативно и интересно. Темы близки для меня и по этому. it helps to keep the knowledge of the language
>the next That ship has already sailed.
Thank u for the Propaganda and covid was man made we all know so dont try to indoctrinate the children
The last pandemic was man made too
Hold up wait a minute wasnt the first one man made?
I stopped watching halfway when this video got released, and only just finished watching it.  This video really falls below the editorial quality I expect from Kurzgesagt. This video smells political as heck. Really disappointed with this one.
Unthinkable, yeah because it is you're not allowed to pass vaccines in months. It goes by years
There's always someone who would want to put out dangerous information into public access.
so was the last one
This video is not 'Kurzgesagt' enough, and feels like something is off :(
And no one said yet this but "it's harder for the wrong people to get into access" is easily *spittable,* especially when societal power involving money and status is in the equation regardless of the openness of information brought by technology smothering one's worldview so expectedly and increasingly spottable. The reason there's conspiracy 'theory' is because _not everything is actually _*_open_* in such level beyond things like Coke or KFC secret recipe. In fact everything is information, in this case a single molecule shall reveal what it has been through that we don't have the technology for currently... and trust me *licking back a spit* is nothing pleasant.
Uh….the next one? Do you read the news?
Biotech is a great equalizer, and *some* people are right to be worried about it
KURZGESAGT SWORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 4:46 CHECK IT OUT THE BOOK SAID SHIT HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLY
The most scary thing is that you put so many hope in what science can do... I think science is realy interesting but one look in the past is more then enough to be careful about this dreams about winning battle against all possible diseases.
I actually loved the animation.
This pandemic was man made...
Not sure why, but both the video image and the title have changed in the last day... this video went from being borderline clickbait to being full-on clickbait with those changes.   Boo on you, Kurzgesagt.  This is the first video of yours I've ever clicked 'Dislike' on.
What do you mean, the next one? My money is on the last one was man made too.
meh,, covid19 was already manmade to radicate humanity down from 8bilion to lesser
Stars trek and sneeze??
The last pandemic was man-made.
The next? That’s wild
Last one was too ;)
Who else realised they actually CHANGED THE THUMBNAIL for this video
Ah, another Kurzgesagt promoting fear, panic, and putting faith in authoritarian policies and people with nary a word to warning about the downsides
Ummmmm.... so was the last one. Your point is?
3:42 That's 10% of people who died in WW2, one of the most brutal life-costing war to date. Just a friendly reminder to those anti-covid, anti-vax people.
This one was already man made. Thanks for the propaganda spewing
wuhan was man made XD
You mean the previous one wasn’t?
This seems like future damage control to me.
Last one was too
Honestly, I echo the sentiments of most of the folks commenting with their issues. This videos main fact checker is also one of its main sources-that presents an inherent conflict of interest because while they're likely knowledgeable, they're more likely to steer the material towards their own conclusions.  Theres also the general scaremongering-while we don't yet know for 100% sure where COVID came from, it seems increasingly likely (and in the eyes of most of the scientific community) that it was a spillover event. Lab leaks aren't unheard of but it does feel disingenous and honestly kind of irresponsible to make such a gross sensationalist thumbnail for cheap clicks when y'all should be above that. Especially since the fear is of home bio hackers but then a complex lab setup is in the thumbnail and the dudes suit is filled with mystery virus. Even if the fear is of homebrew stuff, you're directly implicating labs that have complex procedures in place for containment and study of novel or GOF mutants.   The video itself is also relatively....kinda off. Others have noted the lack of birds, rewatching the video I noticed...a vial rolling off the table which is a gross subtle detail that implies irresponsibility on the part of people looking for viral agents despite that...being an important part of surveillance? Which ties in with the general theme of distrust of scientists if they're not the exact right kind I guess.  Theres also the ties to a nebulous megadonor that honestly seems kind of shady. I get you've done some good vids sponsored by the Gates foundation but this feels different, especially with how off the video is. The philanthropy group in question is also pretty shady and nebulous so I don't think their money was worth it.   As someone in the microbial sciences, its not nearly as easy to construct these sorts of pathogens as you're making it out to be. This would require complex sequencing equipment, cell culture equipment, a team of folks who know what they're doing, reagents, power, etc. It also would require extensive testing which means access to cell culture but also rodents and likely eventually human subjects. Which....is out of the reach of most folks to put it mildly-and given companies track product its likely a government agency could connect the dots some. And ALSO-to produce this mystery virus, you'd need mass production systems which are difficult to maintain and keep from contamination even in professional facilities...not to mention dispersal issues.   Also sharing information is a cornerstone of science! How are we supposed to prepare for new pandemics if scientific data is sequestered so that multiple labs can't work on it? What if another lab has a key insight but they get frozen out due to petty rivalries and that slows down research that precedes a pandemic related to that virus? Should journals not share important data about existing dangerous pathogens just because someone might misuse it? Of course not, because a better understanding of a pathogen by multiple labs can advance scientific understanding and help with treatment or vaccination etc! Should we just not teach young people about science to avoid one of them maybe possibly doing something bad? Should you have to be employed at the right university or corporation to be allowed to access forbidden knowledge? That strikes me as foolish and backward because that knowledge might strengthen them and prime them to become leaders in their field earlier than they would have, allowing them to benefit humanity sooner.   And thousands of pandemics? Seriously? Do you think government's aren't going to crack down incredibly hard if even one pathogen escaped from some dudes garage? Or tighten biosecurity if they find a small lab thats been messing with a pathogen? This is kinda abdurd.   There are legit biosecurity discussions and issues to be hashed out with biotech and homegrown stuff but this video just feels poorly put together and sloppy. I'd honestly say you should just return the money, take this video down, and try to be better because this video legitimately shakes my confidence as a long time fan of your channel.
the last pandemic was man made
Next?
All the comments saying the last one was man made, are you admitting/agreeing that it was indeed a virus/pandemic??? (Naturally or artificially isn’t my question - just the fact that it was/is here - so don’t mention it)
Bruh, you just told millions of people a step by step tutorial on making a bio-weapon in their backyard.
Alright boys we just found the most devious prank
but wait. wasnt the last pandemic uhhmm....
The most recent one was, too! Wild!
We love to act like the last one wasn't.
It is written. Soon pestilence and calamity comes to those wicked humans.
As well as this one?
I think the animation quality is declining
I really loved the positive but not unrealistic spin on the situation
AI will make designer viruses easy that anyone can do.
The last one wasn't?
The most alarming thing of all is the biologists in this comments section confidently stating that keeping a lid on this Pandora's box won't be a problem
I’m kind of disappointed they didn’t delve into the aspects and arguments for both the lab leak hypothesis as well as the crossover theory.
As if the Corona wasn’t man made? This channel is funded by Merical Liberal-Atheists
You mean the last pandemic
This covid pandemic is already a man made epidemic. It all started in Houston Summer 2019 when the mafia and other rich people decided to feed their greed for power and profit. Keep that in mind.
I think you need to post a follow up video to this one addressing some of the criticisms raised in the comments here, and if possible, avoid making videos that imply scientific information should be restricted from the general public.  It shows a lack of understanding of science and is contradictory to statements you've made in the past about your motivations for making this channel.
My lab is a lab that does the detection part in wastewater. It's incredibly useful data that we've collected for the last two and a half years. Hoping to track H5N1 here soon, too, if we can get the funding.+
The last one was man-made too
covid was man made what you talking about
The last pandemic was man made. Also, a huge amount of the upvoted comments in here are bots upvoting one another. All saying pretty much the same pro-pharma propoganda.
The last pandemic was man made.
Interesting content🐸
Hader. Better. Faster. Stronger.
was*
Great another one
Thank you. I already knew the Umbrella corporation was dangerous!
I totally agree with you. There is lot of destroy waiting for us what is made by us. Thanks for sharing with us.
So you want me to do all that?
Why this fascination with world-ending species-exterminating stuff?
Ok but first we need to get rid of billionaires or we ain’t getting any of that good stuff
The last pandemic was man made....
Would prefer the next deadly virus be made in a backyard rather than a secretive government facility tbh. Was this channel always so anti-pleb?
Wasn't it already?
Will be man made? Already been done and released
CV19 wasn’t a lab leak 😂😂😂😂 come on guys…
Just ask bill gates, he's convinced the next plandemic is 2025... Just like c19, but was a trial run.
The covid virus that spread was man made, watched a whole presentation in college back in late 2014 and another one in early 2015 on how they planned on using it to correct and treat genetic disorders. The lady in the first presentation i watched claimed they had already spliced and re-engineered it together with different genetic materials. Good intentions can have bad results sometimes and i think that this is one such case. Cant bury us all for not forgetting.
"Will be?" you mean "Was"
In the end i feel like this is a strategic miss-framing of DIY biology projects, exaggerating their potential risks and minimizing the regulations that already exist on such projects, and it pushes for information regulation which would really lead to further information monopolies and centralization in companies
I love that you all take the time to inform us about the situation that are possible to us but yet with all the bad, good always over throws the bad. I hope that we as a species take the right steps into making a better tomorrow
"We created a 'vaccine' quickly" because we already had been using the same tools that helped us make the bug. 🎤⬇️ Wolves race to the rescue to protect sheep.
I'm shocked a channel funded by a billionaire that's big in pharmaceuticals is advocating for the suppression of info to only a select few (his company). crazy how that happens, im sure he's not a greedy POS and only wants whats best for the world. Thank you Bill for protecting us from the idiot masses of peasants and guild us with your infinite wisdom much like your money.
the previous one was man made, hunty
The last one already was 🫣
I'll need a Hazmat suit for this comment section.
This video is completely irresponsible. It plays into unfounded right wing conspiracies and completely fails to address them, which you can find all over the comments section.
Covid-19 was man made broh
This video was incredibly disappointing. Not only is it not educational, it is fear mongering and inaccurate.   I have worked in biosafety levels 1-2+, have friends who work in level 3 facilities, and have learned about the workflow of level 4 faculties. I have also worked in a virus lab. Honestly, I have a hard time pinning down anything in this video that is actually accurate. Yes, gain of function research is highly controversial and potentially dangerous - thank goodness it rarely takes place, and even then in extremely controlled environments. No, you cannot order viruses in the mail. IF you manage to sneak buying lab equipment to your home - the unlicensed application of which is highly illegal - the types of viruses you could make at home would be quite harmless. Inject your worst enemy with a properly-designed Lentivirus and maybe it will give them cancer eventually - though even this is highly unlikely. Even making those requires far more equipment than you can buy for the price of a car - otherwise your virus would degrade because of impure water, or suboptimal storage conditions, among other factors.  Material you order is strictly tracked, there are special contractors to hire to produce negative pressure ventilation environments, more to install high-power outlets - so many things wrong with this video. I tried shipping non-pathogenic RNA for analysis recently and it was stopped at the border and allowed to degrade because I missed one piece of paperwork - I cannot imagine the hassle of mailing something that is actually pathogenic.   This is not to say that there is nothing to worry about, but we can have an honest and thoughtful discussion about the actual hazards rather than devolve into paranoid schizophrenia.   I like this channel but something is very off with this video. Happy to answer a few questions or clear up some confusion.
This wasn't the case with the last one ?
Really feel like the lab leak theory of COVID was given way too much credit here. In this age of misinformation, playing into conspiracy theories isn't the way to do science education. While we "do not know for sure," this video makes it seem a lot more likely than it actually is, even their sources make sure to outline this. Putting a thumbnail with "lab leak" feels like the low quality clickbait that is all over youtube. So many people consider Kurzesagt very reputable and it's disappointing to see a video like this miss the standard that so many of your other videos meet.
Humans Manipulate Living things
fair to assume, the last one definitely was.
The last plandemic was man made
Who is gonna tell him the last one already was
So was the last one..
So how'd y'all avoid the COVID misinformation warning? You can't hardly mention viruses in a video these days without it showing up under the video.
We haven't verified that the last one wasn't.
2:03 THAT MAN HAS A LEFT HAND ON HIS RIGHT SIDE
The next? Yes the last and the next.
Kurzgesagt wtf man. You used to be cool. All your videos are click bate scaremongering. This is not what we all need right now...
The last pandemic was man made!!!
Comes out like a creepy wishlist
The last pandemic was man-made
Most of the world's problems would be fixed very quickly if it turned to the Lord Jesus and followed His instructions as it's Creator.
Every passing day the mysterious bioengineered pandemic that hits hard and fast become less of a fear and more of a hope
This video is around 3 years late
Covid was man made.
Already happened...COVID
Considering the last one kinda had to be…
Well this pandemic was man made so...
"The next plandemic will be man made."  So just like the last plandemic?
Kurzgesagt, thank you for teaching me how to create a more destructive nuclear weapon! I'll test this in my back yard now, thanks!
F you don't stop the intemadation I'm going to report you..
No birds?
so WHY the hell are these bio labs there in the first place!!!
Already had a man made pandemic. And its wohan virus.
Oh god the feminist are coming in.
covid was man made
I actually agree with the negative comments. This doesn't feel like a Kurzgesagt video at all... it feels like made by one of those clickbait channels there are floating around just making wild claims and vaguely touching the subject with a clickbait title and such. 'WILL' be man made? Like... I really hope they explain what happened on this video or it's the end of Kurzgesagt fr.. jsut one of the many non-reliable fake channels floating around.
But we still can't cure my hangovers!
It always was
People are really fat. Especially in the US.  Stop being really fat and you’ll live longer.   For many reasons.
Hooray we’re gonna destroy our own species 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Absolutely disappointed in the lack of academic integrity in the sourcing and arguments of this video
Lmao, the last pandemic W A S manmade...
There's kind of solid evidence, what we are dealing with is. I mean actually, real science based evidence.
The next ? You mean the last...
The idea of adding yet another slice of human knowledge to the forbidden list of "infohazards," where the government becomes the gatekeeper of information it deems hazardous, is itself extremely hazardous. Any suggestion that we ought to expand the list of infohazards had better be founded on a potential catastrophe that is extremely well evidenced - the more spectacular the claim, the more spectacular the evidence must be in support of it.  This video fails to meet that high standard, or even the standards of a normal Kurzgesagt video.   Most problematic is that the keystone to Kursgesagt's case is the following claim, "Thousands of scientists can simply order the DNA of infectious virus samples online to experiment with them. Assembling these into an artificial virus in 2023 costs about as much as a new car, including all the lab equipment," which is evidenced from a single citation of Kevin M. Esvelt, (2022): “Delay, Detect, Defend: Preparing for a Future in which Thousands Can Release New Pandemics” published by the Geneva Center for Security Policy.  Kurszgesagt states that the script for this video was based on the forgoing paper, which itself does not appear to be a peer-reviewed paper. The author of that paper is also the one individual Kurszgesagt consulted to fact check their script. That's right, the author of the major claims of this video was tasked with fact-checking the rephrasing of his own work.   In addition, the source material fails to strongly evidence its own unreviewed claims. In the above-referenced paper, Mr. Esvelt admits, "While sequenced viruses are widely accessible, pandemic proliferation and misuse cannot yet occur because we lack key knowledge: there are still no credible examples of viruses likely to cause new pandemics." Moreover, the author acknowledges that the screening he proposes as a solution is already occurring voluntarily and he only presumes there to be loop holes and fails identify any.  "the International Gene Synthesis Consortium, an industry group concerned about the prospect of misuse, screen customers and DNA synthesis orders for hazards at considerable expense, it is easy to find nonmembers that presumably do not."  Some will present what they believe to be a counter-point, acknowledging that they can't prove the problem exists, but what if it does and we do nothing to mitigate it? Think of the world-ending consequences!" This is an emotional appeal. It also avoids the requirement that those making an initial claim accept the burden of proof to prove their claim.   Imagine if we so easily allow our governments to close off entire realms of human knowledge on nothing more than the unevidenced possibility of disaster? How far will our tolerance of that kind of intervention shift towards 'better safe than sorry'? If it shifts enough towards 'better safe than sorry' then we risk the list of forbidden knowledge growing with every new administration in the federal (or your equivalent) office. The new additions will be predictably partisan. Some great additions your disfavored political party might add to the list of knowledge you can't possess are as follows:  1. Encryption that prevents an information gatekeeper from determining if you are disseminating or obtaining an infohazard; 2. Methods to safety induce an abortion; 3. Blueprints for 3-d printed guns,; 3. Information released by government whistleblowers.  4. Sexual education materials that discuss contraception, abortion, sexual activities between individuals of the same sex, and so on. 5. Guidelines on nonviolent resistance and peaceful protest tactics to promote civic engagement and safeguard the right to peaceful assembly, and counter-measures against counter-measures employed by the government in opposition to those things. 6. Knowledge about harm reduction strategies and safe drug use practices to mitigate the risks associated with substance abuse. 7. Information critical of climate change theory, or any other theory where criticism has been equated with murder.   Your equivalent of the Supreme Court might stop some of those infringing violations of your right to speak freely, or it might not.   In summary, Kurszgesagt hasn't met its burden of proof and their due diligence on this video falls below their ordinary work and fails to achieve due diligence.  Your emotional reaction to the scary claims made in the video is not evidence of their accuracy. We should resist being compelled to accept gatekeeping of human knowledge for no other reason than we're scared of it.
*insert major world event* will be man made, oh really?
This won't age well (again)
Technically the last pandemic was man made as well. It just didn't work out as well as they hoped.
Way to tell us whst the future holds. You will use designer viruses to keep us in a state of dystopian hell that makes covid restrictions look tame by comparison.  Keep taking your shekels and pay offs. The people that matter are waking up.
the last pandemic was man made
Ewe mean like covid
The last one was man made. Wake up.
All shit here we go again
It does describe a 'probable' scenario but it's by no means an absolute thing that will happen.  A lot of assumptions are made with the effect of ever increasing power of technology in mind but just like the late 1800's idea of the world 100 years on it does not compare to real life.  Could it happen? yes Should we have regulations, guidelines and controls in place? yes Is it possible for a small group or individuals? highly unlikely but not impossible Trying not to be political, but it is government's with the money, funding and scientists who are the most likely to make these dangerous scenarios a reality in our lifetimes.  There should be an international or global consensus on these matters. Though I highly doubt it would happen or be adhered to at the moment.
It's hardly a debate, there is conclusive evidence that points towards man made covid-19 being leaked from a lab.
The last pandemic you mean, covid 19 is not natural
Ummm… the last one was man made. Just ask Fauci.
Id wager dollars to doughnuts the last one was
It has already happened
The last pandemic was man made.
@Kurzgesagt, it appears your video is inaccurate and misleading in many aspects. It would be nice if you could reply to some of the concerns raised in the comment section
who seen the video when the title was "The most powerful weapon is NOT nuclear"
@0:32 Why are some dogs clever and some dogs not?
3:33 I thought this was a conspiracy theory.
You guys are usually thoroughly researched, maybe pull this video and send one of your people to the next ASV or ASM and discuss it before reposting it.  You’ll probably want to change the title and some of the content.  Nature is the biggest biology lab, and the next pandemic will come from there just like the previous ones.
"""NEXT PANDEMIC"""
Um, there is a slight elephant in the room here. Many people think that Covid-19 is man made.
The orchestrators of the next pandemic will be Bill Gates. I can promise you all, his soul will be in torment, don't think he'll be resting in Peace.
You all sure the last pandemic wasn't man-made?
Wasn't the last pandemic man made,by women? 😂
*spoiler alert* its already happened with covid 19 :)
Videos like these where you softly argue that knowledge should be gatekept by big corporations along with governments which are subservient to them is exactly why the Gates Foundation and similar organizations like to give you money sometimes. The solution is exactly opposite, the most dangerous research like gain of function research should be done jointly and publicly in select extremely safe labs with collaboration from rivaling powers so that everyone gets to chance to study and develop countermeasures.  Nobody likes bioweapons, there is no truly safe way to deploy them that is guaranteed not to backfire catastrophically. Every country would love to be privy to others' research and the arms race is based on the fear of not being behind with logic of mutually assured destruction like nuclear weapons. There is a key difference tho. While developing bioweapons the crucial part is developing countermeasures for yourself - something that is impossible for nuclear weapons, if research is shared then it is no longer bioweapon development since you cannot weaponize it because everyone gets the jointly developed countermeasures, it becomes beneficial to all.
When you realise that covid is man made aswell
i think they wanted to title the video : "the LAST pandemic was man made".
Fuckin LoL the last one man-made too you jackasses lol
The last one was too
Next? You are one pandemic late mate.
I remember the time where nature shows on TV were actually informational, condensing ton of material and information into relatively short episodes. Like old Attenborough shows. Now it is one or two trivia facts stretched and repeated with different cadres to expand shows runtime to its limits and provide platform for ads, to make it worse it is not extremely uncommon for stuff to be made up.  Never expected this to happen to kurzgesagt, but last few videos proven me wrong - I guess I did learn something...
I still where a mask
The last was, its been confirmed. On top of that, those saying this exact thing were labeled as conspiracy theorists and most often silenced and banned from social platforms.
I think we should nature be nature. We've been playing God for way too long. We're supposed to be the most intelligent species, but we're too stupid to see that we are not Gods. And it will be our downfall
Covid was too so
Didnt covid come from a lab?
Don't be a dum 🍑, Trump told you it was the China virus at the beginning
Bro the last pandemic was man made.
So was the last one
The last pandemic was man made
The previous pandemic was (china)man made too...
Been watching Kurzgsagt for a long time and I love every episode. I also love how, when they mess up they admit it. No nonsense just "Hey, we were wrong. Sorry" that's character right there.
Already was
Well some people think covid was man made in a lab but we’ll never know for sure
To be fair teenagers and children make most of the iPhone anyway
Awesome video
This video inspired me to build a  bionuclear bomb in my backyard, IF ONLY I HAD A BACKYARD
Are you really suggesting we censor scientific discovery?  That would be a very bad move
Well the last one was, so there's no reason the next one won't be as well.
Infohazard, that sounds like dark ages, where information is available only to "qualified" and "reliable" people. No, information shouldn't be locked away. This will lead to abuse; governments are abusers as well as individuals or extremist/terrorist groups (or even more).
as Chinese, last one probably was
The last one already was 😸
Ah yes, only the next one...
covid was manmade.
Whathever you do, DO NOT jump to 7:25 in this video! Please, don't!
Just reinforces that today's antivaxers are going to kill us tomorrow
what do you mean the next pandemic will be 'man made'?
The last one was manmade let's not act like it wasn't China knows what they did
meanwhile, there are anti-vax people...
So... why don't we quit while we're ahead and stop playing God...
Like the last one.
humans can be very stupid
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made" that is not even a conspiracy theory anymore and I don't mean "backyard" labs...
The last pandemic was also man made lol
The NEXT pandemic will be man made?
There is a great possibility that someone will decide to create a virus that only they are resistant to. It won’t be a scientist, well at least the sane kind😂
So was the last one...
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made", well that makes sense, seeing as the last one was too (unconfirmed, but likely).
Wasn’t the last one man made..
I ate dried milk
I would love a video from you guys about what Type 1 diabetes treatments are potentially on the horizon.
This is how we go from normal to megabrutal. Let's save the world 😎
Covid was man made. Why is nobody shitting on china for that wrecking our lives for 4 years?
In here before the comments section is turned off
Sponsored propaganda
I feel like this video title ("The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made") is unnecessarily inflammatory. Like, some people already believe the last pandemic was purposefully created in a lab, and even seeming to make the claim that the next one definitely will be is only adding fuel to that fire.
I hate censorship ... How about we keep the info public, but have tight restrictions on the _machines_ required to build it? That seems less pervasive and more manageable even...
the last one was already mostly man-made. who're you trying to fool? xD
They love selling youvaccines, next time they will make your life unlivable unless you take vaccines.
So was the last one mate 🤫
what do you mean unknown corona virus? They have studied them for many years prior...  This one was at best slightly different.
* too
WHERE WAST THE INTRO!???!??!?!?
To me the progress in biotechnology and sequencing/sinthesis technology is akin to the progress in computers and phones, truely amazing, unimaginable a few decades ago and a true testimony on how humanity can develop a branch in science and technology if a huge interest/potential benefit resides in it!
The last one was.
This is channel is part of the evil and propaganda! Wake up America! Know your enemies. They are hiding in plain sight!
the previous one was [made in a lab]... so i can totally see the next one being so as well
The title implies that the last pandemic wasn't man-made
as what has happened in 2020, we will have learned nothing when the next pandemic strikes
This pandemic was man made because of people in China screwing around with viruses and changing them.
You mean the last one was...
Guys, I just got a really cool idea…
Friendly reminder to report all sex content bots. Also, 7:26
Consider where this idiotic logic will lead,  Kurzgesagt. You suggest that we restrict rights and freedom as modern technology is 'too dangerous'. Let's follow this ideology then: As technology becomes more advanced with time, we must restrict more and more freedom. With evil people like those at Kurzgesagt and governments in charge, we WILL eventually end up with NO FREEDOM.  Freedom will be inversely proportional to complexity of technology under their rule. Franklin was right.
Kurzgesagt pray for an oppressive tyranny. At every moment they spout propaganda, begging for the state  to take away rights. You are just like the Goa'uld "Ra" from the Stargate film, you cannot bear the thought of free access to information.  Disgusting human beings you are, I hope can't live with your evil.
JESUS CHRIST is GOD
“Next pandemic” yeah lol ok
I think you’re a little late to the party. This actually happened in 2019
Sadly, kurzgesagt has become a mouthpiece for the Evil Cabal's propaganda in exchange for some $hek3ls
Interesting video. I do believe information should be freely shared among scientists, though. I feel like there were some subtle parts that suggest otherwise, and I just wanted to share.
Remember that this channel is funded by Bill Gates, who has a lot of money in big pharma and vaccines. They don't want the info to be shared on purpose, guarding that knowledge also guards their profit margins. Don't be sheep this is obvious propaganda.
As if the last one wasn't
Title should have been "The last pandemic was man made, and so the next one.." bye bye kurz im out
12 monkeys
The previous one was…
“Infohazard” is not a word I ever want to hear again. My stomach dropped out a bit thinking about this. Anybody else?
What an absolutely disgusting piece of propaganda bought and paid for by wealthy and powerful interests who have a vested interest in maintaining their monopoly on information.
What do you mean the “next” pandemic will be man made?  The last one was.
The 'next one.' sure, sure...
Bold of you to think the previous pandemic wasnt man made lmfao, yall remember when this channel talked about actual science instead of political propoganda?
I'm not scared! Any disease a humans can make can't beat my immune system!
The last pandemic was man made too.
Right now they’re too busy propagating the climate SCAM.
Those people already did with Covid
"New batshit virus discovered" excuse me, the term is guano. :P
Did anyone notice the logo of the Umbrella corporation from Resident Evil at 6:48
So this is one of the steps towards becoming more than a class 0 civilization
You mistyped the title. It should be "Last pandemic was man made"
the last pandemic was also man-made
The last one was man made, too.... but that's apparently just too controversial.
Like covid!
*Incorrect. The last pandemic was man-made.*
We've already had the lab leak virus. And it was lame.
Um..... the last pandemic was man-made
The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made....Just like the last one.
Next?
7:09 infohasard is a type of SCP
Great! Now people will rationally balance the benefits and risks of biotechnology, just like we've done with nuclear power!
Is it really worth it for you guys to ruin your reputation with this video? Yall already make so much money from merch and patreon yet you still roll the dice with an overly fear-mongering video with the title "The next pandemic WILL be manmade". You have no way of knowing that and most of the millions of people listening to this video along with the millions of people they talk to will not care to question it. I agree this is a topic worth discussing but the conversation shouldn't be controlled by your sponsor and their cherry-picked narrative. It's such a shame to see such a uniquely high quality channel that has helped so many people out get corrupted. You guys could be making so much more money if you just cut out any meddling sponsors.
I work at a community biology lab and it's actually pretty difficult to get virus, even just as gene DNA, even for non-pathogens. Then, as others have pointed out, you still need to assemble them. There is already a decent amount of due diligence and international collaboration, especially by the large biotech distributors that currently dominate the market. This is one case where the inevitable centralization under capitalism leads to safer systems.  This is of course at the cost of access to the poorest communities and we could intentionally design regulatory systems while also maintaining the spread of knowledge and access to technological resources.  This also ignores viral ecology...the reason that existing deadly viruses like ebola are much easier to contain than COVID has to do with differences in virulence: a long incubation time and a large proportion of asymptomatic infections. Often the traits that allow a virus to easily and quickly spread throughout a population also reduce its virulence as dead hosts (usually) can't spread the virus.
Covid was made in a lab tho
The last one was man made as well…sigh…
Whole genome sequencing is WELL under $1k, closer to $100 rn. The most it costs is about $300, but it seems like it's closer to $150 or $200, and who knows the actual cost.
Only problem with the solution they bring is that a. the problem is hypothetical and may not even be a cause for concern when the accessibility of these methods of destruction are so limited anyways and b. information itself isn't the problem, because this is ignoring the fact that almost any major government today has a biotech lab of some sort (especially eastern powers like China) that can find out about this information without the sources of the scientific community and most likely use it to dramatic effect (which they might have already). No one person is actually dedicated or crazy enough to go through all the steps of genetic modifying and also have the money for it, so the real issue is major governmental powers who do have the resources and the staff required. So this begs the question, why do they frame the danger this way? Because without the free access to the information that gets posted by these scientific journals, we cant hold scientists to the same level of scrutiny we held before, and they're essentially allowed way more freedom than what is reasonably safe. Think the Nixon and Reagan years with the super colliders, or the human cloning that was happening in Korea at that time. Without public scrutiny, these projects essentially went berserk with way more tax funding than what was reasonable at that time.  This is a good time to mention that Kurzgesagt was funded by Open Philanthropy for this video, and their intentions are clear as day. This video only helps further corporations and governments needs to control public access to information, and with the more cloak and dagger they have the more powerful they can become. If this video was independently researched and funded by Kurzgesagt themselves, they might have come to a different conclusion about how corporations and governments would use this kind of technology to greater harm.
Just like the last one.
Well the last pandemic was man made 😂
YEAH... THE LAST PANDEMIC WAS ALSO MAN MADE. COVID 19. WUHAN, CHINA. LAB LEAK.
Honestly, I have loved your videos for years, but this time I’m just disappointed.  This is nothing but sensationalism, with the source being your sponsor? Reminds me of the video funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, right as he was about to buy a vaccine. Something is so off with this video.  The censorship and control of information is inherently anti-science and shame on you for promoting it.
This one was pal
Would scientists tell u that they leaked covid by accident or on purpose
You forgot to put "also" between will and be.
Kurzgesagt what’s going on…please don’t go down the wrong path
Ok but that's literally exactly how it happened (comment is based on the title alone)
Kurzgesagt gets some of their money from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. They made a video a few months ago stating that vaccine immunity is better than natural immunity, which is a complete lie. Doctor's, researchers, and almost any Biologist worth their weight will tell you that natural immunity is way better than any vaccine. In other words, if you caught a virus, like the Coronavirus, and recovered from it, your natural immunity against the Coronavirus will be way better than any vaccine you take. You wouldn't have a need to take a vaccine.  What Kurzgesagt is trying to do here is enforce gate keeping, which is highly authoritarian, but it's come to be expected from a corporate sponsored channel. They never mention in any of the videos they make how the public institutions like the NIH, CDC, and WHO got a loft of the Coronavirus policies wrong, and lied to the public about literally everything. Public trust in these institutions has eroded over the handling of Coronavirus and rightfully so.
The next pandemic will be manmade? What you mean like the last one? 🤡🤪😑🙄🤦‍♂️
The title is wrong, it should be "The Next Pandemic Will Also Be Man Made"
The first pandemic was man made. Get your facts straight
So easy even china could do it? nothing about gain-of-function is easy. cooking meth is easy too i guess
Illuminati generated lies
Kurzgesagt gets a huge amount of money from bill gates to push his agenda.
Basically the plot of Resident Evil game
Next or last one 😂😂
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made" 👀
Authoritarians using the specter of a backyard nuclear reactor to argue for greater censorship, information control and general tightening grip of the ol' establishment. All with the farce only the 'NEXT' pandemic will be manmade- with the last snifflepocalypse coming from a lab as it is. A lab run by who?  Funded by who? The regular citizens are the threat? Hah!
Remember when you were considered a lunatic for talking like this?
The last pandemic was man made
The last one was man made lol
The government already released covid. People wake up
The last pandemic was man made
Thanks China
it already happened 3 years ago, what are you talking about
But we don’t actually know how many people died from Covid.  That particular year. Magically no flu cases were reported.  The US had hospitals fake reported cases, and  the governments covered lots.  So 7 million cases.   Are we sure it was that many? Secondly,  scientifically there is evidence that the virus was altered.  So is that really something that happened naturally when the virus had extra proteins that aren’t naturally occurring in nature like a bat?  It’s not a scientific debate it’s a matter political nonsense
The fuck is this yellow journalism. Get rid of this sponsor. The criticism this channel receives is completely justified. This is barely a scientific video
Don't you mean that the LAST pandemic was man-made
Vid is about 3 years too late lol.
Division 1 and 2 anyone?
You've really roused the conspiracy theorists with this one!
7:26
La première aussi. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol the last pandemic was as well.
I appreciate Kurzgesagt showing this isnt them talking with the details missing from the video. The lack of an intro, the faceless people, the lack of birds throughout the video, and so on. With them intentionally leaving these out they show this isnt them and is instead someone else using their channel.
among us
Ummm... Is this a Kurzgesagt video? Why is it so... pessimistic and sensationalist?
What humans have done to the noble wolf is nightmare fuel, absolutely horrific
I genuinely believe the COVID-19 pandemic was man made.
We already just went through a pandemic created in a lab…
The "next pandemic" ??? Who says COVID-19 wasn't fabricated?
Stop propagating lies about corona virus...
3:35 Oh are we finally allowed to believe in the lab leak without being *checks notes* sinophobic?
The survivors are stray cats…
Wasnt it before?
In regards to the title...       The last one was too..
The last pandemic was man made
Yes.. the 'next' pandemic..
Well we already had a man made pandemic so it’s not to far out there saying the next one will be man made as well.
I'm always skeptical and very cautious about scientific enthusiasm, since the scientific world is like a huge sect that usually acts in its own interests (often covering them with plausible goals and really good deeds. The good deeds can simply be a bait into a trap). Until there is a decent ethical code for the scientific world, which does not allow it to collude with biased structures, until ordinary people are given a tool to control scientists, all this, and all this talk is meaningless. It's time to stop exposing scientists as a chosen caste and celestials.
One of the worst Kurzgesagt episodes. The alarmism, the none-too-subtle calls for censorship...
This one was bleak, guys...not gunna lie.
So was the last one….
Next.... 😅
Damn! Should have never seen the Kurzgesagt conspiracy theories. Now all I see is Bill gates and them spreading propaganda. Ignorance is bliss
the last pandemic was man made
The last pandemic was manmade. 😂
Come on, this video is too naif. There will be a next pandemic, of course, and it will not be by accident. We were told publicy in 2014 that "a new pandemic like the spanish flu could hapen 5 years in the future" and just after COVID the same people told us also publicy that there will be a nex pandemic. Just stay alert and try to discern what is going on.
uh, the last pandemic was man made...
"the next" will be.
Just like the previous one
The last one already was
2:23 They just removed the back glass of the iPhone 11 like an iPhone 14
Pretty sure the last one was tool but yeah, agreed.
Now
The covid 19 one was man made.
Personally, I think the most-likely scenario was that the CCP were working on making bioweapons to use against the West, of which the coronavirus was meant to be one such weapon, but it got released prematurely (deliberately or accidentally) and so, while devestating, COVID was not as devastating as it could have and would have been if fully finished.  Things like bats and pangolins and wet markets were then blamed as a means of throwing off investigations, with high-ranking health officials being paid off to deflect as well (like the WHO saying masks don't work while being led by a communist sympathizer).
The Division has prepared me for this scenario.
this takes my fear from zombies but then again this is all simplified so i guess not entirely
Well this pandemic was man made so, there’s that
You mean just like the previous one?
The last pandemic was literally man made lmao
And to pays for this, they create stuff to fix..... I said it
Funny cause there's an unknown virus going through saskatchewan rn, so far its bad body aches, a lot of pressure in your head, and a fucked up throte
😉
A petition for kurzgesagt to ban those accounts with profile pictures of women being 90% naked and sharing a link which I don't know takes us where
The next pandemic? I thought we were past this
So your saying "THE NEXT PANDEMIC"??????   have you been hiding under a rock or just have no clue  this is outdated information covid 19  was already man made and escaped a lab!!!!! No I did not and will not watch this video I paused it as soon as it started just to leave a comment
You are the best
Lol let be real, covid was all china's fault. The fact the world hasn't held them accountable is pathetic
We just had a lab leak pandemic.
"The last pandemic was manmade"... FTFY
This past pandemic was man made
The Fermi Paradox, solved. As the song goes, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think.
So was the last one.
The next one? you mean the second one?
Christopher Nolan cameo at 6:18
This last pandemic was man made.
Isn’t last pandemic leaked from lab?
When I saw the title and hopped into the video, the first thing I expected kurzgesagt to say was:  “OKAY guys straight forward to the main point, a deadly pandemic has a 1 in 1 chance to occur and we will all FU©️KING D!E😊”
umbrella corporation reference was nice !!
Marceline the vampire queen shredding the beaker at 2:52 👩🏻‍🔬🎸⚡️🎶
As a long time fan of this channel, this video makes me sick. But it shouldn't come as a surprise when it's bought and paid for by such a shady organization. Money will make anyone turn into a greedy scumbag ready to ditch their principles. For you to act like there's still some debate as to the origins of covid proves you're biased and can't be trusted anymore.
Only OGs remember when this was called "The Strongest Weapon Is Not Nukes"
I appreciated the optimism at the end of this video, and we have become able to produce vaccines with great efficiency. Hopefully we'll never have to put that efficiency to any truly terrifying test though. Thank you for another fascinating episode. God be with you out there everybody. ✝️ :)
The last pandemic was man made too.
I’m currently equal parts amazed at biology because it’s super interesting, and thinking that humans should not be screwing with this stuff. It’s 50/50
As was the last one.
Wasn't the last 'pandemic' man made?
0/10 video. title implies the last one wasn't.
Why is this giving me educational vibes but at the same time world disaster vibes
Bro covid is man made....
Kurzgesagt , can clouds exist without gravity?
7:26 amongus
As the last one...
Also wie die letzte auch....
the “next” one.
Man made, just like the last one
The previous one was also man made lol
Just yesterday, I had a depressing session over how pretty all of their posters are and I can't buy all of them
so was the last one
the current one is manmade. you guys lost all credibility now.  your other shit was on the fence already.
As scientist working in a microbiology laboratory, I can tell you it is nearly impossible to get your hand on something dangerous online. The only way to get dangerous bacteria or viruses involve going through an tremendous amount of administrative and certification work impossible to do if you are not in university or big company. The same goes for bacteria and viruses modification, you not only need the equipment (that isn't easy to get as it is expensive and for some them, you need certification and authorization too), but also the people to work with (terrorists are rarely academics). And the cherry on top of the icing, you need to justify why you would like to have such bacteria or viruses to work with. So it is not really for tomorrow (nor the day after), people will be able to make something dangerous in their garage.  The good news is all the tools you propose to put to stop new pandemic are already done since... decades... Next inform better yourself! I am very disappointed how the documentation of this video has been so poorly handled. You really need to make a second video to show how difficult it is to make super bug in your backyard....
You are in a nut shell if you think that they haven't  already been doing that.
I've always loved your videos and I still do. For me you're one of the best science channels on this platform. However, this videos really feels weird. More like an "opinion video" than one that explains actual facts and puts a nice story around it. It's not even like some argumentation videos you made such as the one on meat or nuclear energy. It lacks citations and  grounded facts, it seems like some things you say are closer to an aproximation than the conclusion of particular studies.   I really get a strange sensation from this one. No Intro, no birds, and that clickbaity title (which for some reason you added afterwards).  It's hard to put in word, put you can see kurzgesagt push an agenda in this one. That new title, the argumentation going like "we need to keep biology knowlegde away from the public, the companies will certainly don't do anything bad right, guys?", bad sources from what I've heard, and the conflict of interest with open philantropy, and the video just really being weird, makes me question the intentions of kurzgesagt on this one.   The thing is, they have proven that they can produce quality videos on sensitive and controversial topics, such as the climate change and CRISPR videos, where the argumentation was actually backed by evidence and they explained very well the science behind.  Ironic how the video ends, recalling the worst mistakes Kurzegesagt made, while this video might be itself a contestant for the title.
Прогрев
The previous thumbnail was better
Can't wait for the day when Big Pharma is going to get the government to pass a legislation that allows them to patent the DNA and medical improvements. Sponsored by Open Philanthropy, by the approval of Bill Gates of course.
Acting like the last one wasn’t…
This video title is totally Wrong. Forget future Last Pandemic was Man-Made😢😢😢. We don't know what happened in that Lab.
Don't be hurtful. Be hypocritical.
your merch is not weird , it's beautiful and eye catching, that's why it sells so much
i always get this feeling with kurz: too optimistic for the labs inside an industry and market, too much isolation of science from society and context. the level of pessimism in its reads is not enough in my opinion to be objective about what actually happens in the end: only a few are saved by technology, the rest is at companies mercy. seen from south america, applying things like a street bio scanner seems not only futuristic but dream-like when governments strugle to even have decent city planning and not succumbing to the real-state market.  also, i understand that this channel is focused towards scientific breakthroughs and that kind of stuff, but there are a lot of simpler solutions to a lot of mentioned problematics that are generally invisibilized BECAUSE of the industrial ecnonomic interests: a planned dietary social change could rise general inmmunity in vulnerable populations, a progressive change in the modern agricultural system towards taking advantage and care of the environment (instead of ignoring it and introducing gmos for market performance) could avoid the need for millions of dollars in bioengineering trial and error, and the need for scientists to abide to those millions of dollars backers, instead doing an actual socio-economic applied investigation, backed by an honest government instead of an interested company. in "technology can save us" there is an implicit "us" that is never defined. why could it be? sorry if all of this sounds obvious and innecesary, to me its necessary context.
1:55 "taking expert humans around 3 years of manual work" whereas now it takes 2 weeks and is almost automated. imagine. imagine. IMAGINE how they feel!!! RIPPPPPP :(
That last pandemic probably was as well
i like how this channel makes me so interested in science more than school i truly hope the best for it thanks!
A lot of people are understandably on the fence and this but let's use two much simpler examples that can be easily Googled.  With the high amount of gun violence in American schools these days, would it be responsible to teach kids how to make poison gas out of common household cleaning supplies or how to make homemade thermite from easily accessible metals? Both of these are easier to produce than it is to get a gun and could potentially do far more damage.  Well, were the children when it comes to biotech.
👍
Covid is not a mild virus considering the long covid issues that a very large group of former healthy people is experiencing.
The first one was man made...
"the next" he puts it so innocently in the title. like kurzgesagt expects one. who knows. maybe theyre cooking up a virus in their labs. xP
The NEXT pandemic? The last one came from a lab.
I'm not in favour of restricting access to information. I'm a biotechnology graduate who became a penetration tester (ethical hacker), and my view is that restricting access to information because it moght be dangerous is a surefire way to a) limit the development of countermeasures and b) further empower the powerful, who will be exempt. Detection of abuse & counteracting it is the way.
Haven't all Pandemic's been made by man?? The black plague may have been caused by rats and lesser creatures, but they where all following humans around.
The 2nd you mean.
We already had a man made lab leak that caused a Pandemic.
7:26
The one take away I have from the difference in nuclear weapons and bio weapons. Is that to get nuclear material it is very hard to get uranium ore, and requires large scale specialized industrial  processes to get weapon grade material. Building it after is still hard but then becomes simpler. So security is on the raw materials, less so on knowledge. A bio weapon requires a relative trained individual some specialized lab and just one small sample.
"The next" lol even lmao
This video felt “off” from what I am used to and expect from kurzgesagt. I didn’t get that feeling of being informed after watching this. Felt more like I did as a kid after listening to my father discuss a possible future conspiracy.
I'm convinced the current one was man-made.
I will choose to study biotech and specialize as a super villain with many world ending viruses
Wait! Wasn't this one already?
Wasn’t this pandemic already human made? I thought the lab leak hypothesis was confirmed…
Covid first followed by the blacklight virus and then T virus... finally ending with the birth of Grandfather Nurgle. Woo science!
"Next"... Come the fuck on now...
every time it’s a banger
The first pandemic was man made
The last pandemic was man made.
This video is roughly 3 years too late. It already happened.
The last one was man made....
the last one was. all wars are man made too
Lol this pandemic was a lab leak ffs
Imagine thinking the last one wasn't...
😂 you changed the title for something more “attractive”
China
You forgot the "as well" in the title. ;)
Lol COVID-19 itself was man made
As a Biotech and Bioprocess Engineer I understand this very well, and feels strange that I could make a bioweapon by myself just because of my graduation lol. Love biotech!!!  Not to say that all of this is as easy as it sounds in the video, but in theory yes. People keep an eye in each other during tests so its pretty difficult for it to happen out of nothing.
Not to be that guy, but there's a typo in the title. You spelled "LAST" wrong.
Thank you for this video Kurzgesagt! Today’s availability of bio science tools is definitely a mixed bag, but it is definitely manageable if we try. Looking forward to getting the new evolution map poster!
They create a COVID then sell a vaccine nice bisness😢
Yeah like the last pandemic wasn't man made and caused by a lab leak  Even mainstream media knows this
Your shop link just crashes youtube
Have you thought about reaching out to government organizations with these posters for them to bulk purchase for schools? These would looks insanely cool in classrooms!
It is incredibly depressing seeing how this channel has become a method to advertise for tech billionaires.   I'm out.
The last one was already man-made.
4:45  Never thought I'd see a swear in a Kurzgesagt video lol
The Covid pandemic WAS man made.
7:26
the last one wasn't...?
You forgot the word "also" in the title.
Come on, we all know the WuFlu came from the Wuhan Labs in China (West Taiwan).
Actually we do without a shadow of a doubt know for fact it did come from a lab
The 'trust the science' peeps aint too happy you shared the wrong opinion
The next one?
one of the only videos from you that I disagree with.This open philanthropy doesn't sound like a good thing if this is the idea they support.
The last one was man made too
Great video as always!
Next one will be man-made? COVID-19 was produced in a lab in China. It was funded by the USA. There was a lab leak that released some of the virus.
What the hell are you saying covid-19 was man-made.
The *last* pandemic was man-made.
😂 again!?!
Someday very soon, they're going to invent the Syhpon Filter virus in real life.  (An FYI to those unfamiliar with the series that existed in the early days of PlayStation, the Syphon Filter series referred to a bioweapon that could be tailored to the sex, race, or even *ethnicity* of a targeted group. The game series follows a special forces operator/super spy tasked with bringing down the arms dealer/terrorist organization willing to sell the Syphon Filter virus to the highest bidder.)
yea no kidding, coronavirus was made like that, why wouldnt the next be the exact same.
Honestly i really like this channel videos, but i can assure to you, IS NOT THAT EASY to mess with genetical biology, this is more a funny video than a informative video, honestly i live in Brazil and even here is really dificult to work with genetical biology, so much regulation, su much laws, honestly if they put more regulations and laws its going to be relly dificulty to keep working with biotechnology. I think it's the first video i am going to give dislike.
The nuclear analogy clearly doesn't apply here. You spent a long time explaining how anyone can order what they need online and access open source virus databases but when it comes to nuclear it takes a State actor to harness nuclear power for good or bad.   I'd urge anyone watching this to read Nick Bostrom's paper titled The Vulnerable World Hypothesis. That's an eye opener for sure.   I think the advent of open source AI models in conjunction with these DIY Biolab kits could potentially spell the end. I just don't see how we navigate this.
Aren’t we figuring out that the last pandemic was man made too though?
Isn't all pandemics men made? If you think about it we're heavily affect pandemics with hurting the environment and trashing everywhere Because or World Wars, Spanish flu and many other pandemics appeared, because of people eating ANYTHING the current pandemics appeared... just saying we don't need to modify any viruses we're dooming ourselfs
Wasnt Covid made in a lab? I usually like these videos but this one seems like it was backed by Bill Gates to feed us a narrative
Imagine creating something so deadly as an evil person and it only kills you and never spreads lol
Who says, that the last one wasn't man made? :)
❤
your last contagian measures are inherently against darwinian evolution.
This was supposed to be published in 2019?
The last one has been man-made as well.  Predict conditions in full force.
like the last one wasn't...
Oh, just a change of the video
Well, the last pandemic was from a lab soooo
The last pandemic was man made
Hey, just saying this video only popped up in my recommended randomly. I didn’t get a thumbnail in my subscription area and I can’t find it on your YouTube channel page. Did this get blocked somehow or did I miss something?
They changed it
Alright, more dumb vaccines on the way
The next pandemic will be woman made. The first was man made and ordered by "philantrophic" billionaires. Shame on them!
That's crazy cause the last pandemic was man made.
NO BODY HAS EVER READ THE COMMUNITY GUIDELINES TO EVEN SAVE THEIR LIVES.  That said, I am just gonna continue to believe the evil government that the last ademic starting with a pan without the prior beginning letter "a" originally was man made and sent to a fish market where they claimed it came from bats.
Sarkism?
So, the next pandemic will be like the last one.
The last one was man made too !
The last pandemic was man-made, so.
The LAST pandemic was man-made.
YOU CANT COME,SAY THAT AND JUST LEAVE
It's really annoying that you keep changing the titles of videos after you post them.
That kid who made a nuclear reactor in his backyard
The problem with all this is that we still don't know how big a role viruses play in ecosystems. They obviously play a role, so eliminating them might be a danger itself.
This one was man-made its just taken more time for consensus reality to catch up.
I can always count on Kurzgesagt to make me aware of something terrifying.
COVID was literally man made LOL
The most recent was man made😂
Damn too bad this video didn't come out earlier!
The last one was too! :)
Wow, that will be two in a row.
The last pandemic was man made......
Human DNA 1000 dollars. So like 1/2 of the rent in US. Onwards humanity
9:58 If you mean that a certain species has a certain traits better than the other cuz of his genetics and he didn't evovle spontaneously then it might be right,  but assuming that human is an spontaneous evolutionary product from monkeys is wrong and Kurtzgesagt would have evovled from monkeys then which is something i don't see Kurtzgesagt as.😊 I love the whole video 🤍💙except the evolution part.  How would  46 chromosome(human) evolve from 48 chromosome (monkey), you'll speculate and say it's a mutation or something,  how are u sure about that then??? And why do we still have monkeys today and if so why did certain monkeys evovle and others not 🤔🤔???? why isn't it simply god starting the creation of human with 46 chromosome.  Use your minds, guys.  The quran says the following. (And recall when your[[Singular]]Lord said to the angels, “I am creating a human being from potter’s clay, of fermented mud.)  Is it science matter or the belief in god matter😏😉 Have a blessed day my friends🤍❤💙
Life saving treatments… for people who’s insurance wasn’t dropped by all local doctors.
"The next pandemic will be man-made". You mean just like the last one?
The last one was already
A Nintendo Switch user and bio-terrorist at 5:06
This pandemic was man made wdym?
The last pandemic is man made
Stop taking money from billionaires to be their propaganda machine. I implore anyone reading this to watch; 'How Kurzgesart cooks propaganda for billionaires'
as a person with a disability im still locked down to avoid covid.  this disease never ended
The current one already is
Next thing you know we discover a wonder element that is used for good but then corrupts our planet and creates kaiju, starting the entire plot of ARK.
With great power comes great responsibility. If you don’t believe this statement just look at the majority of people with power; most of them abuse and/or misuse their power in some way.  Side note: I specifically separate abusing and misusing power as a way to differentiate the severity. Not all misuse of power causes harm.   My rule of thumb:  Correct use = responsible use of power. Only used with good intentions and extreme care to minimize potential damage.  Misuse: Irresponsible use but doesn’t cause harm. Like cheating in a video game but the only cheats you use only effect you (and there’s no secondhand effects + all chain reactions only effect you)  Abuse: negligence and misuse of power that causes harm to others. That includes indirect harm, direct harm, secondhand effects, longterm consequences, chain reactions, etc.  Edit: I don’t have an opinion on necessary risks and necessary sacrifices. It’s not my place to judge those decisions and it would be insensitive of me to judge them.
Let's make content based on solid evidence and not just speculation, please. Science also stands for doing the right thing. Spreading fear and uncertainty is the worst thing you can do as most humans nowadays are like panicky headless chickens. So, please, we would like videos on solid facts before Youtube cash-grabbing scary theories.
Our last pandemic was most likely man made
Did these guys change the name of the video and thumbnail?
Wouldn't surprise me if the next pandemic is man made since the last pandemic was man made.
Are the birds ok? I noticed they weren't in most of this video unlike every other video on the channel.
it already was
Fuck all that lsme shit, sell me myostatin blockers or bio nods
This video is not up to par with the rest of your videos... This feels more like "don't trust your neighbor" kinda propaganda. You should do better.
The last pandemic was also man made.
I think you meant to release this in like 2019 😂
The last pandemic was man made too lol
I love how there’s 50 million biologists in the comments talking about how bad this video is lmao
So was the last one
Why man not woman?? 😅😅😅
The last one was
The last one was man-made. And the one before that. So yeah, duh?
bro uploaded it 3 years too late
The current one is already is
Love the cameo of Mr DNA
The last pandemic was man-made aswell.
The last pandemic was man made.
Oh no, the next one too!?
we do a little trolling
Hmmm this was not? 😊
This is fearmongering. The biosecurity field exists just for this and it's developing as quickly as the field of biology. The basic safeguards are already in place. Of course, there is still danger for a manmade virus, but it's far out of the reach of a single bad actor's hands.
Part of the animation looked like the methods of the chinese government. Was that by accident?
Wasn't covid leaked from the Wuhan laboratory?
They're priming us, for what's to come
Gatekeep the equipment not the information.
lol like the last one
I’m loving how quick these are being uploaded
The next? I'm sure the last one was too 😂
This is a very strange video for Kurzgesagt. It does not feel like any of their other videos. It feels rushed, many of the features of their other videos are missing, and the title is incredibly provocative given the remaining controversy and lack of clarity regarding Covid19. I just get an overall sense of suspicion regarding this video and it does not sit well. Feels like their new sources of funding may be having an impact on their content.
As if COVID wasn’t lmao
4:07 SPIDER-MAN REFERENCE
This one felt way more clickbaity than usual. More doomsday Sci-Fi than usual; granted I've heard some similar speculations from scientists in the field yet they still weren't this hyperbolic.
This last pandemic was man made. There is plenty of evidence for this.
The last pandemic was man made too. I don't know why this is new.
The next one? What about the last one? 😂 Brought to you by Wuhan.
You are 4 years late ...
I love how you guys explain difficult stuff in a easy way. Also, love the references to Resident Evil.
Okay but i need that soundtrack tho
"Next" Lmao
Well... shit 😔
The last pandemic was man made.
The last pandemic was man made
Great stuff as always :)
Horrible video. Even a non-insider can feel the huge stink coming from the idea of keeping information guarded "for safety reasons" which is shamelessly slipped into the video.  First, there is a distance between materials and information.  Second, the information will still be accessible to some - who checks on them? this is the real question, not the delirium of control.  Third, detection. Yea because cameras everywhere are not enough, let's add bio-scans right? Again, not a bad idea, but what are the methodologies to control the misuse of such control?  Fourth, destruction. A machine "capable of erasing any virus threat" is a machine WAY more dangerous than ANY virus. We can survive viruses as a species, until there is a fertile couple of humans that develops resistance.  I'm not sure we can survive such a machine, should it be turned against us.
So, where are the capitalists saying to just let the free market sort it out?
What do you mean the next one? The last one was manmade.
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made" Clearly the last one was
The last pandemic was man made..
Make people less motivated in mass destruction? No, let's just ban the information and chemicals.
Um, the WhHuFlu was a man made pandemic, by scientists in a third world hostile communist aggressor country trying to destroy their enemy's economies. The vaccine was a failure.
YOU ARE AWESOME! thank you!
The last pandemic was man-made what you talking about?
I bet the Chinese felt the same about cheap tech and free knowledge until COV|D got released from the lab.
Like, you could make a replica of your crush in your basement.
Lately, kurzegast has gotten more greedy for views. Preferring Quantity over Quality, forgetting that it's the vice versa that made this channel one of the best education channels.   The title itself appears like how Infographics makes its titles.   Please stop this. Focus on quality.   All that you said here is mere speculation.
Some Resident Evil fans among the Kurzgesagt staff 🎉
The last pandemic was man made as well
NO!  The best machine ever built for destruction of "natural" viruses is the Immune system. So, let's try and leave viruses to nature and don't try to create them in labs giving justifications pulled fresh outta the other end!  This is the ONLY way and is the first & last line of defense against viruses!   Occupy your free time with society building activities by living righteously instead of wearing a lab coat and killing lab rats and then killing everyone else!   Evolve from a Life_Form to "Human Beings". Human values & morals prevent ALL UNETHICAL thoughts, desires & actions! Follow them!  Open_philanthropy should be dismantled asap! Along with Bill Gates's  philanthropy foundations.
you mean ALSO man made.
Did anyone else get an add that was asking you if u watched kurgezaght when you clicked on the video?
Did anyone else get an add that was asking you if u watched kurgezaght when you clicked on the video?
Sorry this needs a correction in title. The last pandemic was already man made.
this feels like an ad read..
The last pandemic was man made
China plague was man made
Time to save a lot of Data from the Internet, before Countermeasures take Place, to keep these Informations
The last already was man made...
This video sounds like propaganda... not like the usual kurzgezagt video.
Sure, limit the spread of information and track who gets what. That will prevent government-run labs from creating and leaking a super virus both with malicious intent and from gross incompetence, especially in a certain country that is well known to have both in excess.....
the last Pandemic was man made.
Too late covid was man made
I cant get enough of your videos, they always fill me with a bit of fear but more hope for humanity.
The next will be man made ? But the last one was also man made ?😅
Biotech is Godzilla!
04:04 Love the Jurassic Park reference! :)
So, just like the last one?
it might be happen, home labs, they accidently infected of pathogens and the report was not included of exposure
As the last one probably was, but will never have confirmation either way, no clear conflict of interest with this video's sponsor and the topic so good job there
next one? didnt the sponsor of the video tell u that every single one are from labs? nature doesnt make it
The last pandemic is was man made pfffff
Hello everyone, this is youuuuuur daily dose of existencial dread.
fuck everyone who hurt kurzgesagt's feelings
Thanks for giving me another reason not to have children
This video ain't it Chief
‘new batshit virus’ nice book title
banana peel😁
Sorry I gave this video a thumbs down because of the unwillingness to tell the truth about Covid. Play ball with my enemy and become my enemy.
Keepin out of trouble with the "next" i see
this one already was
I can't wait for Resident Evil irl
the next stage in human evolution is the plot of subnautica below zero except we are the architects
Fact: Covid 19 was not unknown before it became a pandemic. It was being studied in a lab. Meaning it was completely known about. In Wuhan China. Why would you use false information in this educational video?
Ummmm the last pandemic was man made. Are ignoring that?
5:41 The Great Filter
Not like the last one 😂😂😂😂
As if the previous one wasn't man made lol
Or woman
Is it me or are Kurzgesagt's thumbnails getting more and more clickbait-y?
Devastating humanity is the best news I have heard in a long time.
The last pandemic was man made. We just had a whistleblower that worked in the WuHan lab confirm everything that was hushed up.
It's always the videos sponsored by open filanthropy that miss...  *i wonder why*
Don't you mean the last pandemic was man made?
And itll probably be made by your sugar daddy Bill Gates
This pandemic was man made...
"it has the potential to be both", ye, but if humans are the ones in control of these sorts of things, it's more likely to become a weapon
the last pandemic was made by humans  👨‍🔬👨‍🔬👨‍🔬👨‍🔬👨‍🔬👨‍🔬
As opposed to the last one?!?
Did the title and thumbnail just change?
Wasnt it known that covid came from china that was released? So....
6:49 inputting the umbrella logo makes sense really, nice one
Sorry Kurzgesagt.  This video felt more like you were saying what you have been paid to say instead of doing any research yourself.  As others (Who work in the field) have pointed out, it's not as easy as you claim.  I do remember these same claims being made years ago and regulations being put in place to prevent exactly the scenarios you describe. This video has more of a "We've been paid a lot of money to read this approved script." feel.
At 3:50 is that the UMBRELLA CORPORATION?? (Resident evil)
I smell a bit of Big Pharma agenda in this video, but I assume it was unintentional. All this caution and monitoring in normal countries is not worth much when you have countries like North Korea, China and now maybe even Russia, who just don't care about anyone, not even their own people.
They already said china leaked covid from a lab. The US government claimed it already.
Next 😂😂😂😂
Yeah I'd say that's certainly likely given the last one was too
It’s funny how the title of this video is “The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made” when this past pandemic was already man made. Grown in a lab from gain of function research. 😂
This video felt incredibly weird. Not only the structure, lack of faces, the alarmist tone, the lifelessness of the animation...    What feels the weirdest to me is the sub-par sources, and the fact that the main source for this video was paid by the same organization that paid for this video. I will explain. (I apologize for how long this is.)   I looked through the sources that they listed, and out of the 52 times they source something, 9 times Kurzgesagt sourced the same book. And of those 52 sources, only, to my eye, 13 were about the manipulation and study of bacterial/viral genes in any capacity. (There were 6 on nuclear weapons, for comparison).   And about the claim of easy access to both materials and knowledge that the argument hinges on? There is one source about concerns related to easy access to genetic information, and one about easy access to DNA editing equipment.  The source about easy access to genetic information (other than the book this video is based on) brings up several good examples of the risk involved with being incredibly open with knowledge about viruses and bacteria. It brings up case studies where scientists edited viruses, and published their results, in a way that was a cause for concern. Such as editing a mousepox virus so that it could bypass an existing vaccine, and publishing what gene editing was done to make that possible.   The source does show an opposing opinion, which says that those with access to that information can then plan to counteract such a gene, if a virus like it were to be released on human populations. And this source, while intriguing, focuses wholly on the formal, laboratory-based research. Which this video decisively does not address, instead talking about, essentially, 'backyard biologists'.  Which the second source talks about. This source isn't a peer-reviewed paper, or published in a scientific journal, unlike the first one. This source talks about DIY CRISPR kits - at home DNA editors. But the source makes no mention of infectious diseases, saying that these kits can ".... make bacteria and yeast change colour, produce a fragrance or live in inhospitable places, but their lives are short." The source says that there is very little that can be actually done to bacteria beyond this. Which does not back up the claim that pretty much anyone could have access to powerful gene-editing capabilities.  As for the book - the primary source of this video. I am not inclined to read it in its entirety, but I will provide relevant quotes they listed, and break them down.   For materials access: "DNA constructs of length sufficient to generate infectious 1918 influenza virus can now be obtained for US$1,500; coronaviruses cost approximately US$2,000, but typically must be enzymatically stitched together by hand prior to virus generation, limiting (for now) the number of capable individuals to those also skilled at modern biotechnology. The laboratory equipment and reagents required for these tasks can typically be obtained for less than US$50,000.” So... It doesn't mention who has access to such materials (making it seem like anyone could order it off the internet), nor does it say how easy it is to edit such diseases to make them bio-weapons. That is the only mention of material access.  For information access: “Security concerns are less salient in the current culture of the life sciences, as evidenced by the number of projects explicitly intending to create, identify, and publicly share a list of viruses ranked by apparent threat level.” "Under the current system, a scientist who warns the world of a pandemic-class agent inadvertently provides widespread access to skilled "lone wolf" actors who rely on commercial DNA synthesis, as well as well-resourced actors who do not” His argument appears to be that publishing information about potential pandemic-creating agents or mutations gives people the information to create them... Without considering the opposite side of that coin - it also gives people the information to stop them.  Overall... Not very convincing, to me, at least. The many comparisons to nuclear weapons, in his quotes, feel odd to me. It's the comparison between life, an ever-evolving, extremely complex system, to nuclear bombs and their proliferation, which is exclusively a weapon or energy source. There are no "cures" or "vaccines" for a nuclear explosion, but there *is* for viruses and bacteria. So while there is pretty much only danger in the democratization of information about nuclear weapons, there is undoubtedly upsides to the information on diseases. The collaboration and wealth of information that scientists had on the subject is precisely what led to the super fast discovery of a COVID-19 vaccine!  But, solely the arguments aside... This was a weird video, very unlike most of Kurzgesagt's. The changing of the title and thumbnail (which is done solely for engagement - and Kurzgesagt hasn't shown they cared for that before). The fact this video was paid for by the same organization that paid the man who wrote the book this video is based on, essentially saying exactly what's in said book, the weirdly lackluster sources compared to normal videos, the bad analogy in nuclear, not looking at an opposing viewpoint, not going in-depth about something crucial (like who has access to viral materials), the odd structure, the sub-par animation.... I won't read too much into it, but I can say confidently that this is not the standard quality that I expect from Kurzgesagt, and that I am very disappointed in them for this.  Thank you for reading this. Sorry that it's so long... But Kurzgesagt is a huge channel, doing a lot of good, I think, so I don't want them to go down the route of whatever led to this video being created.  Edit: Spelling mistakes
Right. As if the last one wasn't.
Wait Was This Reuploaded?
Free the information. Hiding how to do something is not the way.
a vaccine so good  you  have to have to do it again every 6 months.
i'm sorry who seriosly still belives the virus wasn't man made you had a coronavirus lab down the street from patent 0 that had a history of poor security and you still want to say it was the 1 in a million zoological leap from bat to pangalin to human when the supposed bat doesn't even live in the region I'm not playing pretend that is the dumbest thing ever. I'm just saying in one theory the virus already exists and just needs to escape a facility that has a history of accidents and on another you need a sick bat to be driven hundreds of miles carrying a heavily mutated strain of the virus that further has to mutate two more times in the span it takes for the bat to be sold the idea these are equal possibilities is absurd to say the least
Destroying a pandemic threat is a bad idea.
Dr David Martin spoke to the eu parliament that covid could have already been a man made pandemic. Additionally he mentioned the pfeizer already had a failed vacine in development long before the pandemic.
The fact that most people are to stupid to realise that covid was man made proves there is no stopping a 2nd man made pandemic. And the next pandemic only needs to have a kill rate of 10% and society will grind to a halt with starvation for all. I have already picked out which of my neighbours i will be eating first. Good luck everyone and happy hunting.
Correction another pandemic will be man made
The CCP is to blame for COVID
I’m pretty sure the last one was
Forget the next pandemic, the last pandemic was man made.  The US Senate paper called 'muddy waters' concluded that Covid was most likely a laboratory accident.
The last one was as well haha
The last one was man made too. They didn't isolated it in a lab. It was unknown. Stop with this propaganda bs.
WAS THIS SPONSORED BY THE GATES FOUNDATION? I THINK NOOOOOOT* I like this channel, by its funny seeing what messages you spread with their money.
So China again?
So was the previous one...
The last pandemic was man made...of course the next one will be too!
I feel like it wouldve been better if yall did a video on antibiotics; not just how they work but show the IMPORTANCE of finishing antibiotics and why there are many regulations on it (in west europe especially), as over the counter prescriptions do more harm to the industry every year. We keep losing antibiotics to use, and its important for people to know why we have them and why we should cherish their capabilities
What's this "next?" The last one was man-made.
Just so you know, kurzgesagt is a tool of propaganda. They’ve received millions from Bill Gates in exchange for propaganda and lies on his behalf. We all know the last plandemic was man made
Someone needs to create the Super Boomer-Remover virus and make the world a much better place. Get 'em all!
I'd love Displates of your posters! Because I don't have the space to put as many posters on my walls as I'd like, exchangeable solutions like Displates would be very welcome!
O shit, the next one too?
Why don't we all just agree to leave only some hand-picked people to create viruses and their vaccines? It's proven to be quite a profitable businesses model. Don't worry, they do it for our own good.
Where are all the birds?
Yeah... Let's watch how capitalism will manage it...
firs bio attack done by female named sheela, osho was innocent but still government poisned him untraceble  chemical
The last one was man made
The last pandemic was also man made.
The next one? You mean like the last one?
Just like the last one then?
Next? This one was also man made.
I wonder why title and thumbnail changed so much?
People forget that psychopaths live among us. All this is very dangerous to tamper with...
Last pandemic was man made. This damn virus was made in Wuhan Lab and if you think otherwise, you're a lost cause
idk, this kinda looks like copium to me. it's all true but the focus looks a bit shifted: is it more likely that the virus will be used as a weapon mistakingly, or is it more likely that it will be used as a weapon intentionally?
The next pandemic that is man made that will not hurt us biologically, but economically… by a rogue AI
The last pandemic was man made.
While i do love kurzgeasagt... the literal evidence is that covid was a lab leak. The literal evidence. I would have had more respect for this video and would have made it 10000% stronger had they used the example of covid to further reiterate the power of man made destruction
*Ironic, the "next" one will be a lab leak. Like the pandemonium of 2020 wasn't a result of a lab leak to begin with*  *Gain of function research done by the US government (also done in parts of Ukraine btw), where the labs cut corners to increase personal profits, resulted in a leak and over two years of propaganda so they and the US government could save face. Not to mention uncountable economic damage. The worst part is that the people responsible never went to trial*
The current pandemic was man made
The NEXT PANDEMIC will be man made?!?! What about the one we just lived through for four years?!
This is cOoL
oh like the last one then
Now people will download viral genome data before access to it is restricted
The problem is that we were already warned years in advance of the Covid pandemic that it was on its way. Bill Gates gave a Ted talk years ago detailing a massive pandemic and nobody paid any attention. The same thing will happen again.   It's like how it snows every year here in the UK, and yet somehow every year we're caught out unprepared and the roads grind to a halt. The people in charge just don't want to put the investment into futureproofing anything, they're too busy satisfying their billionaire overlords. 😔
Next?..
This video was at best a bit naive, telling the public that everyone and their mothers have access to dangerous pathogens, don't you think?
I heard a story where a high school girl made a Nuclear Bomb in her garage for a school project by using a book without any internet   Now with internet i wonder what we can do
Regulating genetic information downloads is not the long-term way to go. We can regulate nuclear materials since they're physical objects. However, due to the replicable nature of information, it is merely far more difficult to regulate, since the black market exists and can always sell you dangerous virus DNA if you wanted to, let alone that certain public agencies may purposefully weaponize biotechnology regardless of any public regulation. Therefore, regulating the information is more of a security-by-obscurity kind of solution.  In the sense of information security and cryptography, the most viable, effective, and once for all solution is to battle on the defender side: making bio-safety infrastructures, facilitating vaccine developments, or even, with some more sci-fi technology, encrypting our own DNA and implementing zero-trust systems within our body -- and these are the examples corresponding to the latter two options mentioned in the video. These techniques are what we have been doing for decades for the safety of our internet and computers, and we will probably do it for ourselves one day in the future.
Unfortunately the last few pandemics were most likely man made
The last one was man made
Very nice
"Next" lol.   The US literally getting away with murder as always.
1:01 WAS IT???!!!
I mean, yeah, give a lot of people access to things that can be easily used for harm and people will use them (like guns in the USA). Then again, science doesn't work when you don't share information, and when you don't share information you also can't research effectively on countermeasures and vaccines.
capitalist shill moment
The last pandemic was man-made.
the last pandemic was man made wtf are you talking about
Like the last one then..
Well of course it will be. We were never supposed to know about the gain-of-function research in Wuhan with Covid, until it accidentally leaked and China tried to cover their tracks. It was only the beginning, and you can expect future wars to include these bio-weapons along with similar ones being used against the public…
wait, wasnt Covid19 manmade?
I think you might be manufacturing consent with this video. Consent for covering up information that proves that labs were responsible for the pandemic.
bill gates propaganda channel.
As opposed to the previous, totally natural pandemic which just so happened to have asymptomatic spread and target “undesirable” populations (elderly, disabled, obese)?
Well, the last pandemic was man-made so it would only make sense that the next one will be too, let's hope that, that country won't get away with it the next time.
Last one was 😅
The next one? riiiiiiiiiight.
4 years too late
The next one? The last one was too!
We will likely eradicate ourselves as a species along with many other species in the very near future.  Humans had a good run
yeap, Your daily dose of anxiety is here! :)
7:26 among us
As a biochemist whose research centered on genetically modifying bacteria, this video is entirely hysteria based on a lot of faulty claims. I’m alarmed by the call for restricting the free exchange of scientific information, and I recommend we all look at the organization sponsoring this video with additional scrutiny.
Now here comes the batshit idiots who have no knowledge of these topics spread their fear and insanity in the comments, Enjoy!
That’s the first video of Kurzgesagt that I didn’t like 😅. I myself work in Biotechnology. In laboratories we have safety measures to not let anything (harmless or harmful stuff) get out. There are really just few labs around the world that are S3 or S4 labs and are even allowed to work on dangerous organisms and these are highly regulated! I think that’s missing in this video..  Labs that can not even follow S1 safety standards should not even be allowed to do any work. And I hope they find these labs and shut them down.
How far this channel has fallen, this proves money will affect how information is given 😢
4:45 "New batshit virus discovered" 🤣
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made"  So was the last one.
I think the third step is not likely possible because for me it sounds the same as asking a mechanism that destroys the virus to first determine "does this virus halt or not?" which is the halting problem and, unless biotech wants to claim they can build superturing machines (which is still subject to the further halting problems), then no such device exists in a Turing Complete problem space. An Oracle, might work, but would only be tailored to specific viruses and would not work in a general sense.
Great idea, give the control of information and tecnology to the government and gatekeep it from the people. What could go wrong?
What if a virus had been "released" from a secret lab before it was in its final form and spread around the world letting the vast majority of us to build up antibodies so that the final form of the virus will not work as intended?
You wanna take away muh freedom.
While I do acknowledge that biotechnology has the possibility of being dangerous, I condemn you for even suggesting that infohazards are credible and that we should stop the free flow of information that has brought this field so far. Also I think it's almost nauseating of you to suggest that somebody that orders virus DNA online should be tracked. The post 9/11 security state has provided no evidence of it's benefits, and now you want to extend it further? I quite enjoy the rest of your content, but this "Too dangerous for our own good rhetoric is fucking annoying and all your going to get lawmakers to do is fucking blanket bans which basically kill any hobbyist community something has. Also fuck long termism and fuck Open Philanthropy. People that ignore current suffering because future people might exist are truly disgusting psychopaths.
As if the most recent one was not
So you want to increase Big Pharma profit by stopping the development of better medicine. Just like stopping nuclear energy increased the profits of Big Coal. You're evil Kurzgesagt team.
all where man made
LAB LEAK... Isn't this channel funded by BILL GATES!? Is he trying to admit something he already admitted!?
Kurzgesagt, this is fucked. You want to stop the spread of knowledge. Fuck patents.
This all may be right, but it won't benefit us. It will be used to create profit.
Reminds me of the sheer power found in an average smart phone compared to what the moon landing was done with.
The last pandemic WAS manmade.
So like the last one... noted.
eager to learn about that batshit virus 4:45
Successfully predicting the past...
The next one?! This one was man made!!!
Wasn't cov19 already wuhan produced? lol
..the next one? LMAO
😂😂 covid was already made
The last one was f*cking man-made, your a bit late with this one
oh man, sorting comments by new is a fun experience
Labs in population centers... no ban research like this inside of cities... think Andromeda strain.. the labs working with these kinds of infectious agents should be out in the middle of nowhere with a nuke under it. Quarantine lab workers for a least a month before letting them out. The research is necessary but governments should treat it is like the threat it is.  We all know now the lab of experts was the likely source of COVID even if some want to pretend is wasn't.
So same as the covid pandemic
Implying the last one wasn't? 🙈
dude, I would literally buy every single item in the shop if it was digital. Wanna make sure I don't resell it? Make it an NFT. But I'm ok with any digital version
isn't there a shop in europe / germany?
no, these pandemics cannot be created by anyone at random, just like people dont make their own nuclear bombs at home, even though the recipe has been around for a while. We dont try to kill everyone around us, as it is said by many fear mongering politicians and globalist lobbyists. I believe in the good of humanity and i know that the everyday working man adores normality and freedom most of all. I am so disappointed to see that conspiracies are coming true and that life is so harsh due to lies spewed by those completely corrupted by an elitist agenda. Please stop trying to play the bill gates tune of overpopulation, stop trying to convince us to feel guilty for living, and stop trying to make yourself(whoever it is that bought you guys) feel good about creating these pandemics.  Youre taking the sheep to the slaughter and patting yourselves on the back for doing it. The planet will be nothing if theres nobody here to laud it(again, i am addressing your corporate masters, owners).  I am truly disappointed to see what youre becoming kurzgesagt. Another branch of the nihilistic crowd of leeches that cant live and let live.
Some American in 2035: "The second amendment protects my right to have these deadly viruses to protect my home!"
"THE NEXT PANDEMIC" will be man made 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ok then 😅
The last pandemic was man made too...
Dr.Bombastic more like Mr.Bombastic 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
I think this video over simplifies molecular biology and suggests that genetic modifications are easily carried with great success.  Additionally, this video poorly represents the data currently available about the origins of SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19.  This is one video where I think more information should have been collected before releasing the video.
Next one too eh?
Damn, if you think about it we technically have god-like powers that could destroy the globe
the last one was too. but the gates foundation won't let you say that
lmao, COVID came from the Wuhan institute of virology where they were studying coronaviruses and looking for ways for it could infect human beings. You can have all the scientific debate you want, but the reasons for it happening are sociopolitical
Ya but i keep seeing dumb people all over new York city. And real human zombies in California they just stand and stare in the sky.   Also average USA student math and science score is below Chinese/Asian average.
Y’all better pinky promise to not make any deadly bioweapons cause that would be a big no no.
The last pandemic was already man made.
State affiliated media label now pls
Shit video hope you got paid at least
OUR PREVIOUS PANDEMIC WAS MAN MADE.😂😂😂
4:45 almost caught me off guard with that "new batshit virus discovered" XD
ROFL quit fear mongering 🎉
Next?
Again? 🙄
9/10 OF ALL PANDEMICS ARE ALREADY MADE IN CHINA 🤣
The last one was man made
The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made. yes, china (communist governments with American money, Fauci ap) proved that.
I think we already started a pandemic. Anyone remember the last one?😮
The last one already was.
I’ve never gotten the ick from watching a kurzegesagt video before but I did this time. Something feels quite insidious and fear-monger-y about the content of this YouTube video. And the solution? Restricting informational access to the public? Bad vibes
Wonderful video! it inspired me to start experimenting with my own viruses.
Having connected my PS3 to the Stanford University Medical Supercomputer via the Folding@Home network, I like to think I contributed to all of this in some small way. Also, love the cameo of Mr. DNA from Jurassic Park! I was thinking just a moment earlier of when he was talking about analyzing the genome. “If we looked at screens like these once a second for eight hours a day, it would take two YEARS to view the entire DNA strand.”
Sorry but you made a ton of mistakes with this one, and the fact that it's sponsored makes me feel like it's biased for a reason.
thanks for daily portion of new fears!  ps: Aside from jokes, you guys really rising very good questions I totally agree with the statement. Thanks for enlightening in this particular topic
The next pandemic is lgbtq
what do you mean "next" ?
Just like the last
"unknown corona virus"  Controversy aside, I hope to not experience a pandemic again in this lifetime.
"in the end, 7,000,000 died" from COVID-19? But we haven't reached the end yet. I know the political emergency phase was ended, but we're well and truly into an endemic phase where thousands of people continue to die every day around the world. We can only hope that the next pandemic won't start before the current one is under control.
Oh, so just like last time then? Great!
COVID was
The last pandemic was man made...
The lesson here is that freedom creates prosperity and progress.
The Last Pandemic Was Man Made
Hey guys the world is fucking depressing right now I cannot watch these please stop making horifying Videos and go back to disccusion stars and such pls and thanks
Crazy and scary how the few can kill the billions.
Could have sworn that the thumbnail and title changed... And now it reverted.
The last pandemic WAS manmade.
I'm disappointed with the statement "whether COVID-19 was natural or came from a lab is still up to scientific debate". It's not. The SARS-COV-2 virus has no unique properties that lend itself to being an artificially created virus. There's also no evidence in favour of the lableak hypothesis.  Finally, new diseases coming into existence is something which happens frequently in nature. Saying that there's credibility to the lableak hypothesis is like saying that the recent earthquakes in Syria & Turkey were man-made by detonating nuclear bombs under the surface. It's an overly complicated explanation to a problem with an obvious solution. If something has happened countless times before humans (and will continue to happen countless times after us), you better have exceedingly strong evidence to suggest this time it was caused by humans. Said evidence, does not exist.  There's also the fact that the lableak hypothesis is also extremely politically motivated but that's beside point.
the last one was man made
I'm pretty sure I've seen every single video y'all have made. You do amazing work! One I'm curious to see is specifically about the gut microbiom. I'd be super excited to see that!
The last pandemic was man made. Lmfao
Don’t wanna be this person, but wasn’t Covid a lab thing
The previous one was also man made though?
Even the last one was...chin3s3 virus
Governments should focus their efforts on very specific and serious threats to humanity such as this one, by controlling the spread of information on dangerous viruses, instead of limiting people's freedom in all sort of relatively trivial things such as how they invest and manage their money, how they travel ("security" checks), freedom of speech (i.e. regarding political / antiwoke stuff), etc.
Nice thoughts but, the majority of good effects go to few people (we still have people dying of starvation in the world) while the bad effects goes to everyone.
and so was the last one
Misinformation, no birds, deviates from the usual promotions.. What's wrong with you guys? Who forced you to do this?
Nice resident evil reference at 3:50 :D
the last pandemic was man made too
Why don't you do a video on our dependence on water and if other creatures could evolve to live without it?
The last pandemic was man made..
Just like the last one lol
Now I believe, krissh 3 was way ahead of its time 😂.
Isn't this one 4 years late? :D
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made", oh just like the last one.
Covid has been proven to be man made from the lab in wuhan china! The BBC has addressed this!  This video should really address that, please dont start pandering for views and lowering the quality of your content!
Imagine making an uncontrollable super weapon with friendly fire on and that is extra good at killing people that have lifestyles exactly like your own country. _glares at the other side of the globe_
yes, the next one ;)
The next pandemic is pollution
What happened to the intro?
Good video
No kidding, so was the last one
The last one already was
Without watching the video: aren't most pandemics manmade?   I count viruses/diseases going from person to person and mutating and 'man-made.'
Covid was made in a lab
the previouse pandemic was man made
The last pandemic was manmade.
The next pandemic? lol what do you think happened with COVID-19??
Can we make a virus that is only deadly to statists who want to regulate biotech with state violence ?
Literally Coronavirus was man-made in that it was derived from an already existing virus. Why did you change the thumbnail and title? Not getting enough views?
Well, this video is a bit late or that is some gaslighting clickbait, because the last pandemic was manmade …
This is actual propaganda LOL.
YOU MEAN THE LAST PANDEMIC WAS MAN MADE LMAOOOOOOOOFREIJFOIEHJ SO MANY PEOPLE DIED WTF IS GOIN ONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh
Kurzgesagt, I always wonder Why do you change your video title and thumbnail one day after the video has been released I have seen this happen quite a few times before also
Irresponsible show meant to cause panic. No evidence that dangerous viruses can be produced in labs. The pandemics come from invasion of eco spaces of animals , producing industrial scale  chicken and other animals  over crowded living factories.  Instead of advancing pseudo scientific theories,focus on eco invasion, humane rearing of animals and drastically cut down animals for food. Result will be a healthier human being, safe eco spaces for other species and a healthier planet.
Said Fauci and WHO
congrats, you predicted the past...
Nice touch with the umbrella corporation
As per tradition!! 😢
This pandemic was man made
The last one was too fam……..
bro this recent pandemic was man made too
Is this channel saying last pandemic was NoT man made..? All our diseases were man made through..
Pls like this comment because i dont get any likes 🥺
US government funded gof research that was under way at UNC: Chappell Hill prior to 2011 was grandfathered in to continue when Obama (officially) cut off most gof funding in 2011. That state of affairs persisted until around 2015 when the research was taken to China, whether through espionage, bribery, private corporate channels, or by whatever other means. That was the research that created covid-19.
The last one was too. It was man-made information warfare.
This was a weird one...
Last one was man made. But we're not allowed to talk about that.
One word: politics. It stunts everything it touches and unfortunately it has touched everything and will continue to touch absolutely anything that becomes mainstream
Just like the last one
If this video came out three years ago the title would still work.
—Shit. I just released an airborne virus with an 87.6% lethality rate on accident.
the last one was too
The last one was man-made.
One of Kurzgesagt's funders, the Gates Foundation, created the last plandemic. Kurz should have a video that covers Gates' funding of research fraud.
Is it you, or utube who deleted my comment? Censorship at it's finest. Lol
As an avid follower of your videos, I'm not impressed with this one. Why take a stance against open science? Open science is why we are able to do all those marvelous things you mention in the video. You underestimate the role of regulations that are very strict, and you overestimate the danger of wmd-scale work being done in a garage. I would have thought that there was some anti-science agenda behind this if I didn't know kurzgesagt for many years.
This is stupidly stupidly optimistic.
When I saw this video with it's first title, deadlier than a nuclear bomb, or on those lines, I was like: I'll watch that, later tho. This new title made me want to click faster. I don't want to tell you what to do as this company has way more idea of works on yt than I do, but just sharing my mind
Sorry but 6:43  reminded me of Nile Red😭
Open Philanthropy is owned by Bill Gates. Bill Gates funded the Wuhan lab which released COVID-19.  So yeah, I'm subscribing Kurgesagt.
*the last pandemic was man made
Not good news at all...
Yeah but you'll be called a radical when this happens so I'll be awaiting the apology video
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made" The last pandemic already was
Good luck getting people to take a vaccine.
Didn't the last one also man-made?
I missed the oppening.
The best science and space teacher, better than anything at schools and college, He just makes the experience fun to listen too, and he is how I fall asleep at night.
THEY CHANGED THE THUMBNAIL AND TITLE AGAIN!!! BRUH!!
School shooters gonna look like absolute chumps in a few decades from the sounds of things
Nice Resident Evil easter egg you added there 👀
Idiots making plagues as a trend was predicted in the After The Bomb RPG, at least the 2nd edition published in 2001, and I'd be surprised if there wasn't something even earlier than that. Granted, it incorporated a household appliance called an Electronic Genome Generator or E.G.G. intended to make cloned meats and such being a core component, but still.
What if scientists combine rabies with something and accidentally creates a zombie virus....this is actually possible i guess what if the next pandemic is a Zombie Apocalypse
Title suggestion: Next Pandemic will be Man Made (like COVID-19 pandemic)
Ah yes, because China totally didn't intentionally cause COVID pandemic together with russian biolabs.
Something was off in this video...
6:23 They weren't worried about the nuclear technology getting into the public, but getting into the hands of the Japanese, who mind you were planning to release a plane full of fleas infected with the bubonic plague right before we nuked their well-deserving asses into oblivion.
Amazing video birbs :'3 thanks for creating it.
Me a biotech major:  It's biobomb time💣
We also need to be better at taking vaccines
The last pandemic was man made.
Would it be out of the question to imagine a future, extremely germaphobic society?
but the last one WAS man made and the vaccine was created before the virus was even disasembled
The "next" one??
The next Pandemic will be manmad! (the last one was too) - There fixed your title.
So you mean COVID the 19 😅
This latest pandemic was already man made.
I thought corona virus was man-made
Wow! This was a stunning and breathtaking video - visually. I truly enjoyed the neutral and point to where there was a mention of humans having the potential + ability to change and I really appreciated that point. Thank you to all who worked on this video. <3
Yup, everything makes perfect sense when you get your information only from “The Right Sources”. Everything seems to fit in place so nicely. I’m so glad we’re all so smart—not like those other people.
We're doomed. It's just a matter of time either a madman or a clumsy nerd will kill off a big chunk of humanity.
LOL yeh the next one, the last one was totally incidental.
this video feels sooo fishy, this is not the kurzgesagt that i know and love
The last pandemic was already man made by China.
COVID vaccines and boosters gave me myasthenia gravis which is autoimmune neuromuscular disease -
you act as if that wasnt the case with the last one.
COVID 19 was it leaked a lab
TL;DR - we're fucked.
Спасибо за качественый контент}
The last pandemic was manmade....
Literally the last one was...
It's insane how irresponsible scientists are with information that could be deadly
0:56 -- How is it an "unknown corona virus" when they created the thing in the lab? Is this a joke?
This title likely be "The past pandemic "likely" by human made."
The last pandemic was man made...
The previous pandemic was man made
The last pandemic was man made.
bro is playing plague inc irl
This video is 3 years late, maybe because Vodafone Internet? Dont even have to watch it since the last pandemic was already man-made.
so was the last one
Guys look at the thumb nail look that hazmat scientist the guy in the hazmat suit is in pain
It doesn't even cost $1000 to get genetic materials made. I know of people who have little formal medical training, yet created a legitimate genetic therapy using a virus that are not harmful it to humans and some customized genetic material.  To create a weaponized virus is even easier.
Ok now fix my chronic disease. Oh, you can't? All the money went to weapons and boner pills? Well, see you never...
I mean if it's anything like the last one
So was the last one lol
The last one was man made. It was a gain of function accident.
I loved the resident evil reference
the last pandemic was already man made tho
Been there done that
what do you mean next ???? it already happened in 2020
So I'm a bit in contention on this one. For example while the cost to sequence a genome might be thousands, the sequencers to do so sure as hell are not. I work in research and we have a specific sequencing facility. To say this is in reach of average individuals is a bit hyperbolic. Now add to that your statement regarding synthetic viruses made. Me want to spit out my drink. We have actually publish papers about methods that could produce say a pandemic form of influenza h5n1 that could probably make covid look cute. This info is freely available and doesn't even involve genetic tech but just repeat infection systems. Why haven't anyone done this? Because working with the viruses aren't easy and is not cheap either. Now to do it for a purely synthesized virus or bacteria? Ain't that cute. Literally 99% of academic labs couldn't do this today. A purely synthetic virus 🤔 or rather a basepair synthesized one. Ahhh. Yea that's just as nuts. Quite honestly this is borderline fear mongering... And tbh not your greatest video. There is actually a case of lab leak virus for the influenza pandemic called the "Russian flu" albeit poor name. There is always trade offs. High lethality virus doesn't spread fast because fear. It's why Ebola never got far. Covid and influenza tend to have highest numbers because of lower kill rate. You don't have to force people in quarantine if lethality is above 10% they'll do it themselves
Among us???
To not understand that the last pandemic was man made ia lying to yourself and everyone.
Why should I not throw you into the back rooms level run for your life?
Sadly these suggestions won't do much while like a third of the population refuses to get vaccinated even in the middle of a worldwide pandemic...
The last one was man made already
I saw this and went to my mask compartment and sighed sadly as I went here we go again
Irrelevant. Natural or engineered, our reaction will be the same; some will follow the science and the rest will prove Darwin right.
Sweet I'm making me the T Virus! Err I mean....I am going to....study and...erm...stuff.
It is not up for debate if COVID was man-made. It wasn't. Folks studied it very early on; and it does not seem to have any artificial markers. Shame on you for sharing that right-wing talking point as "still for discussion in Science".
Like this one wasn't man made...
The next one could be, but the last one was also man made.
That's funny, because this one was also confirmed to be man made a few days before you uploaded
Previous pandemic was man made
i feel like this is the first vid that actually doesnt put things into a proper perspective. some of these price comparisons are ridiculous and ordered scientific materials are usually tracked.
I love you birds so bad for working so hard for us.
Yeah, the last one was too, newsflash
So was the last one...
The last one was man made...
The last pandemic was man made
This title reminds me of the Mitch Hedberg joke about how he used to do drugs. Also, another beautiful sunny day. 🌞
Knowledge is humanity's greatest double edge sword and must stay a double edged sword. I hope for the day where the attempts of an evil scientist at creating a super bug are thrwarted by your grandma at home or by some 3rd grader with what they learned via even more readily avlaible information
…just like the last one.
Is it a bababoi?😊
The first thumbnail was cooler
I wish this video was five years old
U guys didn’t do the intro😢
cough cough, this wouldnt have aged well a year ago... actually i dont think it ages well now
It would also be great if Public Health officials didn't lie about their involvement/culpability in creating these dangerous pandemics in the first place. As well as not calling those that tried to track where the virus could've originated via the scientific method racists or conspiracy theorists and allow for open debate to challenge the claims health agencies are making as that is the foundation of the scientific method. Or I guess everyone can go back to "believing" in science as if it's a faith and not based on empirical data.
Little on the nose, eh?
I’ve loved this channel for years but the videos of late have been  going downhill. I know they have a clause saying their sponsors can’t mess with the facts but that’s really not been the vibe lately. This video seems especially strongly influenced .
'Still don't know' LOL, yes we do, you cowards. The Chinese people will eat ANYTHING regardless of danger or moral repugnancy - THAT was the source. They even know which Hunan killing stall and was shown in their own report, before Pooh Bear and Party killed it (and probably whoever put in on an accessible server). The biggest killer is Authoritarianism.  On ALL continents.
The next one?  So just like the last one...LOL...
where did the birds go?
Yeah, control the public.
Cov!d19 was man made, it was from a chinese lab intentionally released as a global experiment.
Just like the wuhan virus.
THIS pandemic was man made.
THIS pandemic was man made.
Ferb I know what we're gonna do today.
Lol.. as if the last one wasn't.
I haven't researched this to know what is true but to me this is terrifying 😮
Me: Hasn't had an existential crisis yet today. Kurzgesagt: Allow us to introduce ourselves.
"(...) YOUR DOG."  😆😆😆
Please don't go for these clickbaity titles, you're supposed to be above this. Edit: They changed the name. Phew.
Oh yes, the next one will be man-made, this last one was totally natural.
Man they already say they make the viruses bill gates said they all say trump said they all tell use they making viruses we just ain't listening
Low key wanna go back to quarantine
I learned how to create improved Super Soldier Serum!!
The last one was also man made.
Uhhh, The last one was also man-made...
correction. the next pandemic will be man made again
Sorry but, the NEXT one?  Yeah, about that Kurzgesagt...
im the furthest thing from an expert in any field relevant to this, but a lot of this just... doesnt pass the smell test for me (or many others). for instance, i feel like im gonna get put on a dozen watchlists looking up anything thats only slightly suspicious, how is somebody gonna get the materials to whip up some deadly, highly-contagious without getting a visit by the feds
Well considering the last pandemic was man made this video title is not exactly a difficult prediction to make.
You're too late, we already lived through it. Sadly there will be more to come.
The last pandemic was man made lol
Why do you always change the thumbnails and often the titles on your uploads recently? Come on, a channel that *supposedly* does as much planning and research as you should have the comparatively simple task of one picture and a title settled easily.
funded by a non-profit which itself is funded entirely by a tech billionaire, advocating for the privatization of and making scientific knowledge more esoteric and inaccessible for society.  If there's a time to unsubscribe from kurzgesagt it is now.
Oh my God you absolute liars, we know with 100% certainty it was the product of the wuhan lab. How dare you continue to propagate misinformation is it because you don't wanna lose your grant whoever pays your bills you hypocrite you're a science education channel report the science don't live part the lies the you understand me.
taking this grant from the wife of the co-founder of facebook, and the other co-founder of facebook further degrades your credibility as an independent thinker. nobody should take you at your word from this video on, as you have compromised your integrity to an unthinkable degree.
“The next pandemic will be man made”? This last one was man made😂
That's already been done... Ever heard of COVID-19? Soft rollout of this concept... And all y'all fell for it . Those of us who have been begging you to see it have never been fooled.
The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male was a study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the United States Public Health Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on a group of nearly 400 African American men with syphilis.
America has bio labs across Asia and America.
When watching this channel, take in the facts, but ignore the recommendations altogether. The authoritarianism coming from the Gates is palpable.
*last pandemic was
this video:  DO NOT BUILD A BIOWEAPON IN YOUR GARAGE 😉😉😉
Covid was man made. What do you mean the next.
Who says Covid wasn’t ?
7:25 among us
I usually like the edu-tainment coming from this channel, but a lot in this video was really irresponsible, and frankly seeing that its been funded by an "effective altruism" org (effective altruism is essentially the idea that you should get a lot of money and then you get to decide how that money is helpful. It sounds nice on paper but the reality is that its rich people reappropriating wealth from exploited people to serve their pet projects in the name of whatever they decide is the good of mankind. Some God King shit tbh) really dampens my opinion of this channel.  Painting the biotech landscape as being equally as accessible as it is public is frankly... wrong. I can forgive this "opinion" if you simply read a paper on what equipment was used and then fill up a shopping cart with it and say "see, just any asshole can build a death bomb" but this removes the context of the training required to USE the equipment, let alone the steps published articles on virology lay out - which is not always cut and dry as evidenced by... fuck just look at chemistry tbh. There are three things in a ten foot radius of me that I could use to build a functioning bomb that could cause massive damage to wherever I set it off, and I could then say "its only a matter of time before we are all dead from all the bad people building easily accessible bombs"  the reality is, we get to these fast results and incredible progress in biotech through compartmentalization of tasks which is made much easier by free and open information trading. The separation of labor prevents single bad actors from enacting harm and attempting to lock down public health info really just weaponizes the science because it puts the information exclusively in the hands specifically motivated to weaponize it - political entities.
This Pandemic is caused by putting the under regulated p4 lab in China,  by letting totalitarian control the weapon they should not have,  by the useless UN and WHO controlled by totalitarian countries,  and by the natural dark side of humanity.  in the history of humans, Pandemic always happens. this is a part of nature but the mistake of humans? I do not see any change in the past 3500 years history.
Whyd they change the title and thumbnail?
Most recent one already was
Black hole > Viruses
So Plauge inc. in vr
Funny comparison with nuclear science and the nuclear bomb. Nukes were dropped when information was gatekept by a state. When the knowledge was widely spread, no more nukes were dropped. I don't think monopolising is even close to a good idea. I don't trust any government with this power and we can much more easily react if we collectively know what we are dealing with and can work on it in concert and in attack the problem from different angles.
7:26 among us
The vaccine was created months after the pandemic but with no time to be tested is very dangerous and unethical and more dangerous to spread to the public
Heres hoping...
Ah yes, the perfect video to,start my morning with! I have a new hobby to start now thxs!
I like how we are all still pretending “We don’t know if it was a lab leak” the first 3 people diagnosed with covid 19 were all scientists who worked at the lab specifically on novel corona virus’s. Also it’s hard to trust you considering you take money from the bill and Melinda gate’s foundation. Call me a conspiracy theorist but I don’t trust them or anyone they give money to.
Im going to love the day when we are told to hide indoors for no reason, no one listens jist like covid, and we all die to death.
4:46 we saw that  "New Batshit virus discovered" XD
Thanks!
7:26
Unlike the last one, that came from a pangolin and a bat playing underwater backgammon or whatever, right? 🤣🤣
Take everything that was said here and apply it to AI tech.
Too late.
previous one already was
Very nice team you have here
The last pandemic already was...
So waa the last one
The Last pandemic was man made.
They leakin’ pandemics like game updates
Like the last one you mean?
Man made? So just like the last one then
How many of them were already man man?  The more time I spend on this rock the more I learn how seriously actually evil and unethical things they government has done for the sake of ... something.  I mean, I used to think MKUltra was just conspiracy theory.. but, no, they really did poison a water supply with LCD to make super soldiers or some crap.  There's been so many horrible things the public has been exposed to and either not told about it until years later when it wasn't an issue anymore, or the ones we know about and are conditioned to believe it's _actually good for us_ to save themselves some money.  Because we can't use tax dollars to regulate and implement safe chemical handling, confinement or cleanup of hazmat when they need every dime of it to buy weapons and blow up not-white people.  They industrial military complex is working paycheck to paycheck, they need that revenue.
Hey I’m studying this rn
This video feels more like brainwashing.
i think this video would sound quite horrifying for people who no nothing about biotechnology. most of it was right, but the tone seems like this is a huge threat. and just play into conspiracy theories instead of explaining why it could happen.
The next pandemic will be man mad? THE LAST PANDEMIC WAS MAN MADE!
Like this one wasn’t
Giving the terrorists crazy ideas with this video I think. Maybe don't let people know how easy it is...
You mean like the last one?
Its very bad, making this video to say indirectly that last one was not man made. Didn't expect from this channel.
6:28 you should probably ask the USA where 6 of their nuclear weapons are... they lost them
Another one?
"Next pandemic will be man made"  Wasn't the last one man made as well? COVID-19 straight from a Chinese lab leak
I definitely didn’t put a Roman Candle in my shorts zipper and thrusted with the timing of the fireworks going off. That would be dangerous.
Wasn't Covid proven to be man made?
But the last pandemic WAS man made... it was literally a Bioweapon China was working on until the lab leak..
speed
Just like last....
Pretty sure the immediately passed pandemic was man made; the preponderance of evidence indicates that, at least
The current pandemic IS man made
Please stop doing these partnership videos.   Its wrong to take their money to promote their agenda.  It could be a good cause, it could be something you agree with.  But its wrong. Please stop.
THE CURRENT ONE WAS MANMADE
We dont know that last pandemic was not man made. We have China (and probably dozens of other institutions beholden to them) to thank for that.
Wait so no intro?
Coronavirus = PLANdemic.
Fyi  You can't buy dangerous sequences  Lmfao 😂
Why did you change the title and thumbnail?
About the title.... Um the NEXT pandemic? The last one was confirmed as a lab leak from Wuhan. Kinda missed the mark on that one lol
“The more incredible and impressive a science will be, the more possibilities open up in every single direction with magnitude scaled up proportionately.”
7:26
am I the only one who got the Jurassic Park reference
"The next pandemic will be man made"  Oh you mean like the last one?
As a bioengineer This is bullshit  And would cost billions
After years of watching, I now have to unsubscribe. Didn't expect this level of propaganda from this channel...
Last one was too.
What was the last one again?!
Next? :))) Isn't that the censored theory or did we move past that already? How many shots should we get for the next one?
We could do a lot of things. But I suspect if we'd have invented nuclear weapons in the age of Facebook and the Robert's court, we'd have blown ourselves up already. We can do a lot. "We" don't seem to do jack shit.
This title is incredibly click-baitingly alarmist and the video is obviously heavily influenced by the political and moral values of the sponsor of the video, or maybe Kurzgesagt themselves? I hope they wont continue this downfall, I loved the times when there were less biases and corporations' money
Just like the first one 💉✡︎...
LEGISLATION/LEGALITY  This is the problem. Also, corruption or espionage. Either someone SOLD a secret, or discovered it. It doesn't matter what "protocol" we use, if people don't follow it. We need tighter laws and penalties for spreading misinformation, or "weapon knowledge". We need more secrecy on that, but at the same time, people in charge will have to anwser to the common people on what they do. Not spill what exactly they are doing, but: "we found new areas for research, your tax money goes to biology department" sort of thing.
Not a big fan of the title... good video as always, but wouldnt agree with all of it.
This is proof that Jesus will return SOON…
The last one was man made too. Nobody cared.
Like the last one wasn't
I just got a ad abt some data dude talking abt u 💀
Like the last one
The last one was man made.
"Still up for scientific debate" no, it had HIV spliced into it, it was made in a lab, no debate.
next pandemic will *also* be manmade. i fixed the title for you
Whelp this channel is dead now. Bought and sold by special interests. Rip
As if it was that cheap or that easy, most laboratory don't even have money for research, also it's extremely hard to hide something like a deadly virus on your garage.  You keep reinforcing that science should be something for a controlled group of people. Love u guys, but this one it's unnecessary.
Nice propaganda 👏👍
Reminded me of the game The Division. Imagine that actually happening in our lifetime, that'd be crazy
Implying the last one wasn't....
The last one was too
The last pandemic was man made by the Chinese....
Yes. this is true. The NEXT will be man made. Now what about the LAST one? And the one before that? Etc, etc. Are we talking intention? Genetic manipulation? Or just understanding disease and using it to weaken you enemies. History is dirty.
The last one was too.
The most recent "pandemic" was already man made, why wouldn't the next one be?
A bunch of pandemics come from animal agriculture which is man made, so yes, I agree.  That evolution poster is the bee's knees.
"Next"
Fund an institution to create the coronavirus and create a pandemic Fund a YouTube channel which ''objectively'' spreads your message Gain world control, billions of dollars and power because of the virus Create a youtube clip with the title: ''The next pandemic will be man maid''  Bill Gates and co loved it
I think the question should be, "Why can't I build a nuclear bomb in my backyard?"
The next one? My guy, we JUST had a man-made one. Ain't no way people are still believing that "bat from a wet market" story. There was a god damn bio-lab not far away from said wet market, and China's refusal to comply with inspections until the place had already basically been sanitised says it all. They were hiding something related to Covid.  If there is a next one, it'll be even worse because this first one was a successful proof of concept.
The next outbreak? Lol
I take serious issue to the concept of an "information hazard"... No Knowledge or information should be locked away no matter how great the perceived threat.   Pandoras box once opened you can't stop the information from flowing out   All this does is give a group of people who are classified as "worthy" to obtain and hold that information and knowledge from the rest of us.. which historically speaking has never been good
So was the last one, so yes
"a future where we control biology" and on the day that happens 7 dictatorships around the world will covet that control and immediately start churning out super soldiers.  the eugenics wars are now inevitable
I smell a Thumbnail change
Fantastic video, as always!
Like this video, the next pandemic will be sponsored by Bill Gates.
Did anyone else read the title and immediately think "Again?!?".
Kurzgesagt really be pulling the uno reverse card with the evolution poster
this video feels so weird, like it's attacking free share of scientific discoveries, wich is something amazing about science... it's the first time I have this feeling in a kurzgesagt video in years watching
3:50 omg they used Umbrella Corp logo 😂😂😂
Wasn't COVID one already
Kurzgesagt used to make awesome educational videos but this one seems more like an alarmist clickbait.
this last pandemic was man made
tf you mean the next, we have the capabilities rn. not to get into some conspiracy territory the lab leak hypothesis is still very possible
The last pandemic was man-made.
you mean, like covid was?
The last one already was.  Or didn't you get the news yet?
The last and the next 👍
You missed two important words. Instead of “next” and “will” you meant to say “previous” and “was”
you forgot the intro
The next pandemic?? COVID CAME FROM A LAB TOO? Tired of pretending it didn’t and  any excuses trying to say it didn’t.
The current title of this video is "The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made". Look, I understand creating sensationalist titles, since that's the only way to stay competitive in the current environment of YouTube. But a title like this is definitely a step too far in my opinion. It presents a possibility as a certainty, which is dangerously misleading. They correctly pointed out the uncertain nature of the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, so it's baffling to me that they still went with this overly conspiratorial title. I hope this was just an oversight, because this channel is currently one of the best on the platform in terms of how they present uncertainties.
Youve released three videos in within the span o fa couple days, chill out guys.
Next?
Given the claim of a lab leak at 3:36 despite that conspiracy being repeatedly debunked, including in peer reviewed journal articles that are newer than the obsolete sources cited in your description, it feels like this video's release was deliberately timed to coincide with the relaxation of YouTube's policies against COVID misinformation.
Isnt this channel largely sponsored by the bill and melinda gates foundation?
The failure of our school system really is apparent in the comments 😂😂😂
lol, just like the last 'pandemic' then.
this pandemic was man made
How do we get people to stop saying stuff like "one thousand times cheaper". It is just more confusing than saying "One one thousandth the cost"
As a biology student this types of videos keeps me going toward the end of my degree
Is that the hazmat from Rust???
The previous one was man made TOO
The Gates Foundation sure enjoyed funding this.
so was this one
The last one was!  Things dont just happen to happen at the right time ,  covid came about in the absolute perfect time.  Just happen to have the tech to make a vaccine in record time, the world was able to continue working from home with zoom /teams?   But in a world of ground breaking tech we cant find where it came from ?  😂
The last one was also man made.
I read "fan made" and I sat there perplexed for a minute...
Wait wasn't the last pandemic man made?
I doesn’t matter where it come from, it will definitely be our fault.
In the future with advanced technology, all it will take is one intelligent, resourceful person (not a government) to destroy humanity and/or the planet.
It was a man made too.
Bro i Keep Getting An Ad Saying Am I Watching Kurzgesagt And i say "Yes"
The last pandemic was man made…
Wouldn't the the first time eh, Billy Boy.
*The last pandemic was man made.
The next one? So was the last one.
I recently finished the Stand by King and this honestly scared the heck out of me
The last one was, too. The CCP might just get away with it, too.
Thank you, bill gates
Anyone can synthesize a virus in their backyard  Covid: 🙄” casual whistling”
You should get funded by governments for the amount of knowledge you share and work you put to encapsulate it effectively yet accurately. Thank you for your work!
Man Made In A Factory Farm.
I didn't know you could cram that much propaganda into 8 minutes
Or an intentional release!
The story at the end was really wholesome honestly. How an imperfect poster turned into a huge motivation to become better and sort of ''adapt.'' Spiting one's past mistakes is one of the best ways of learning, afterall.
This is the sketchiest video you have ever made.
Last pandemic was man made 😂
The answer is yes: Bill Gates is also behind this video. As well as the noses and idiotic 'effective altruism'. Don't buy into this positive view of the future, hold certain people accountable instead.
Next? You mean current...
imagine comparing nuclear technology with bioweapons. apples and strawberries lol
Yeah... the next one...
Honestly, I basically lost all hope in humanity and trust in the government during the COVID pandemic and tr*mp era. Seeing the amount of anti-science politicians currently in office and the millions of people who support them made me realize there really isn't much hope in trusting anyone to come together and prevent any kind of outbreak.  We still have people, especially people in our government, that deny COVID is real or ever happened. How can we possibly trust them to prevent any kind of future pandemic?
We can all blame the cover-up by the CCP in China and the W.H.O. is pretty pathetic to bow down to the CCP overlords, the Omicron variant was supposed to be Xi but only because to avoid offending Winnie the Pooh. The biggest reason of all is the world is too dependent on China, they worry China is like their economy's bloodline, decoupling China is basically severing your bloodline and your economy's heart will suffer cardiac arrest. Should the next Chinese pandemic comes, the cycle repeats for sure and the W.H.O. still decided to cover for China.
As the last one.
The last pandemic was man made.
Please rename the title to… The previous pandemic was man made.
"Next" lol
I don't know about tat, but I know the last one were
after all these fuckin republicans were too stubborn to wear so much as a mask i'm not super optimistic...
People in 2040: this guy right
Hmm, the next. Glad that's never happened before
What do you mean? COVID-19 was 100% man made. Bill Gates did a simulation of what an outbreak would look like a decade before COVID was released into the world and claimed millions of lives. The Spanish Flu could’ve been man made as well. This is one of the many atrocities the wealthy elites bring to suppress the 99%. The wealth inequality gap is widening thanks to pandemics and corruption of societal structures by the wealthy elites. They are long overdue for a regime change.
Again
What a good scifi
of course it's the GERMAN account on YT that is fond of suppressing the knowledge of the global population.
...Suddenly, that one episode of Doctor Who where a decimal error (caused by a scientist having her glasses cracked that morning) created a bacteria that _literally melted any biological matter of terran origin_ (and was going to be vented into the atmosphere if Twelve didn't set up a firebomb in time)... doesn't sound that farfetched. 😨
The last pandemic was man made.
We can never truly conquer disease, there will always be some incident.
I think one of the big steps, is, unfortunately, that systems like CRSPR can't just become low end classroom tools or home chemistry sets. They are, quite frankly, far too dangerous for that. Biotech differs from Nuclear tech in this one extremely important manner - it's dirt cheap, and will only become cheaper. As a result, anyone with bad intentions and a modicum of capability will in the future be able to build superweapons - but ONLY if they have access to the data describing the diseases, and the equipment to construct them. The data is controllable, but with considerable difficulty and a good chance of things slipping out - however the equipment could in principle be made quite hard to gain access to outside of accredited laboratories, which would dramatically reduce the risk, and no-one will be able to build their own equipment of this sophistication at home.
20 bucks says another pandemic us just 2 years away
bout to make resident evil but irl 🔥🔥💪
This one was, too. The Coronavirus lab in Wuhan will never admit it was their error. Mask up. If the viruses don't get you, the wildfire smoke will.
What if covid was china tactic at dat trade war everyone quit talking about
like the last one wasnt
The last pandemic was man made .duh
Same as the last.
Do not -in violation of patent law- design metabolically engineered microbes that biosynthesize essential nutrients like retinol and distribute them to black markets in the global south. I know it's easier than ever, but we have to respect patent law and intellectual property rights so that companies can reap returns on investments in research that was mostly publically funded.
egg
does this help us cure cancer ?
The last pandemic was man made... So no shocker here.
the last pandemic was man made
I will take one extending life gene edit please.
False info in this video.   The vaccine created "months after" the outbreak began wasn't a vaccine using the virus' genetic material. It's a temporary spike protein immunity booster for the spike proteins that line the outer shell of the virus, NOT the virus' DNA.
Lol tf you mean next, the last one was 😂
Can you talk about beetle juice going supernova pretty soon?
Plot twist. The last one was man made…..
Heh the next.. lol
The last pandemic was man made, old news.
What do you mean the next pandemic? The last one was already man made.
Title should have been the last pandemic came from a lab
This is not gonna go well in the comment section yikes. We all know what Lab we are talking about here and the perpetrators starting with the CCP
The last pandemic was man made
Human genome project in 1991 was shutdown because "UN" was afraid. Just imagine if they completed it.
and Covid has spawned naturally... is that what you are saying....
It is already man made
I though this already happened
And this one was not? 😂
This was very clickbaity and sensationalist ("The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made" really?). And the video feels rushed, too simplified and not very well researched. Below your standard for sure.
This legend can get more than a million views in just a day
This video feels sensationalist. I'm getting strong [citation needed] vibes from some of the claims, such as a highschooler being able to create a super virus.
Technically is neither good nor bad, but it will be used for everything anyone has an incentive for
The last one was too
Aaah yes, the good old dread-hope combo from kurzgesagt. It had been a while
Me having a cochlear implant: 0:37 WAIT!! WHAT? It's recognised??
The last shamdemic was man-made.
No dip. Bill gates had released engineered mosquitos to the world recently.
And the last one wasn't?
Thanos was right. Day by day it gets more and more clear.
The previous one already was 😞
Bruh what do you think happened in 2020?
THIS pandemic was man made
I’m not certain _“vaccine”_ means what you think it does.  Also, who paid for this, and what does their win look like?  Lockdowns and mandates forever, just in case? What’s the matter?? Don’t you care about saving lives???
This video is full of irresponsible nonsense, which is frankly very disappointing coming from Kurzgesagt. Nuclear weapons proliferation is a massive problem. We're dealing with the fundamental forces of nature here. Security through obscurity does not work. The first people who invented nuclear weapons were able to delay their acquisition by other states for a few years, but that did not last. Nukes are everywhere now. When it comes to bioengineering, we gain FAR more from sharing research publicly than we risk by locking it down.  Perhaps taking a page from the infosec community would be a good move here: Responsible Disclosure. Whenever a new particularly dangerous virus feature is discovered/developed, notify vaccine developers first so they have time to prepare a response if needed, but do not put up any long-term barriers on broad access to research data. The last thing we need is proliferation of viral zero-days caused by researchers being afraid of sharing their findings.
The “NEXT” one??? You are a little late to the party my friend. It already happened.
Will mean it will happen but we can’t look into the future
uhh the current one is too
"UnKnOwN cOrOnAvIrUs" :D clown world
So was the last pandemic.
I think you missed the blindingly obvious and that was the fact the Covid “plandemic” was manmade, out of the lab in Wuhan China, funded by Fauci and released around the same time as the world military games in October 2019! What part of any of that do journalists…. Etc etc…. Not get meaning they don’t ask the right questions. Ffs!!!
"This video was sponsored by Bill and Melinda Gates" Okay then let's throw out this propaganda.
Why do the creators changed the thumbnail of this video from "Bio-Nuclear Weapon"?
"The next pandemic will be man-made" -- so, you're trying to tell us that the previous one wasn't "man-made"...? Kurzgezagt, you truly are pathetic.
Covid19 is from the Wuhan lab
4:03 - Call out to the DNA Narrator from Jurassic Park; I'd seen this on big screen and it's been inscribed in my mind ever since. Good to see an old teacher also.
I love you how CHANGED the cover and title, seeing how the last pandemic was man made... a bit late to the game.
8:25 breathtaking ways 💀
This wont age very well, i tell you.
I think I'd prefer to build spaceships with gardening tools.
The one we just had was man made buddy
Just read the title, and thought to myself: Well, yah mate, the last pandemic was alrdy Man Made, so... little bit late on the clock there fellas
I like how the title is like the "next" pandemic will be man made. As if the Corona one wasnt already
But what are those beakless circular faced creatures you use instead of birds?
As King Crimson once said, "knowledge is a deadly friend when no one sets the rules"
Just like the last one?
the _next_ pandemic?
I believe in the promise of tomorrow. I fear only idiots.
Lol, the last pandemic already was man made.
this feels like a warning of what is coming, not just a random video
I'm pretty sure covid was man made also.
Who got the data ad ?
Salve signor kurtzgesagt ad Anna non è piaciuto questo video, per favore il prossimo fallo più bello
Love your vids, not to be political but the Covid related stuff is politics only :(
So we're pretending that Coof19 wasn't man made.
So you’re telling me there’s a chance I won’t have to pay back my student loans?
Tell me what pandemic that hasen't been human made. ☕️
You say this, as if most/some weren't.
That "advertisement" sign should have been on the video from the beginning, no?   Also this video feels a lot like fearmongering. Why shouldn't we share the knowledge so anyone anywhere can help to create vaccines? We can't win at biology, we're not gonna prevent future pandemics, it's a natural thing that can happen. What we can do, what we should have done WAY better these past years, is share knowledge. Large parts of the world were excluded or were given very limited amounts of vaccines, and people were intentionally misled about safety procedures so people weren't careful enough and refused vaccines.. The reason so many people died has everything to with the greed of wealthy people and corporations, selfish ignorant individuals spreading fear, and literally NOTHING to do with how virus data is shared with a global population.   You've built your brand on making easy-to-understand educational videos, but I haven't trusted this channel for a few years now and it's sad to see it hasn't changed. You get a lot of things right, but that makes it dangerous when you don't.
I think they are a few years late with this video
Just like the last one was man made
I’ve never been so eager to create a weaponized virus in my backyard
No wonder you guys changed the title from this "The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made". What a joke..
I mean, the last pandemic was man-made too so....
There is a lot of evidence to suggest COVID-19 came from a man made source, however that was sort of glossed over by the WHO  as China is a major contributor to its funding
the last one was, of course the next will be
Corona is definitely from a Chinese Lab and they should pay for it
Nice reference to the Umbrella Corporation from Resident Evil.
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made"  Just like the last one.
7:26
The “next” pandemic will be man made. Covid was a man made pandemic, so “next” has already happened.
7 million people died of a "relatively mild virus".  Wow.
COVID-19 was the first man made pandemic (that we know of)
Cool. Hopefully that one will make traffic a little more bearable.  Dunno why I'm saying that though, I don't drive.
covid 19... made by china... we were already there..
The last one was made in a lab so this tracks.
It's unsettling that you're using no faces in your animations this time. Is there a reason for this? If you don't want to animate faces for some reason, what about using your birds instead?
Humanity loves Kurzgesagt!
Super needed video, great work
Conmenters criticising the reality of this: there is more than just virus development that had the potential to be dangerous, for example mycelial. Speaking to student researchers, they do sometimes unintentionally produce samples that require CDC interference to securely destroy them. This video is speculative, but the key point is accidents, being extremely unlucky, or extremely malicious COULD be a serious threat.
So was the first one…
So basically the preamble of Jurassic Park
This global homo again. Global homo art and globlist artist.
Sars cov2 is man made!
....and the last one was not?
And this current Pandemic (which isn't over yet), could also be man made from a Lab in China.
Kurzgesagt keeping the nihilism streak going!
Super covid. Lets goooo (conspiracy truth 2024?)
What do you mean the next one will be man made? The first one was man made and was a total fraud
7:26 funny.
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made" is a really irresponsible title in this era of conspiracy theories. As a typically wonderful science communicator, I expect measured statements and less click bait from you.
Umbrella corporation on the video
you mean covid ?
Covid came from WIV
The last pandemic was man-made
The last one was too.
This video seems different. Like they want to promote some kind of agenda. Also it seems dangerously inaccurate.
The most recent pandemic was man made
uh yeah, the last pandemic was man made, is this a joke?
Just like the last one.
This one already was man made.
La Infection...
Accessing this information is definitely tracked.  Even if they tell you its not, very likely it is being tracked.  Like they want it to happen and want to watch.
Wasn’t this video originally titled “The Most Dangerous Weapon is NOT Nuclear”
First time I put a dislike on a Kurzgesagt video (I've always been very particular about putting a like on all of them because they have always been very good). I'm sorry but this is an extraordinarily bad take. Restricting information flow is never the solution, we literally come from that system and we got rid of it when Ilaria Capua started the movement for data sharing in the field because it was hindering scientific progress way too much already.
Considering this one was man-made, this isn’t exactly a hot take.
The Umbrella building lol
Unpopular opinion: This already happened 2019/2020 with the so called "Bat-Flu" from china.
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made" so, same as the last one then? or some of the really old ones before, for that matter. cool, now that we've established that, maybe we can hold China accountable for what they've done.
Covid was made by the Chinese as a weapon to attack the US.
The last one was too.
You are late, about 3 years.
all pandemics are man made. look we can have pandemic of disease because of war - this is man made and mos previous was like this. hmm most - all.... and all next pandemics will be man made - the warst case are pandemics made in lab. we are now in that century right now. so basically human can adopt to 99.99999999% of normal diseases but gen/lab made not so much.
The last pandemic was man made
What do you mean “next”? 🧐
You mean, like the last one?
ITS ACTUALLY ALLREADY HAPPENED... PLUM ISLAND ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF LIME DISEASE ON THE AMERICAN PUBLIC... THE SOURCE OF LIME DISEASE COMMING IRONICALLY FROM A SUPOSSEDLY 6000 YEAR OLD GLACIAN ICE MUMMEY OTZI THE ICE MAN... US GOVERNMENT WAS WORKING ON IT AS A POTENTIAL BIO WEAPON RESULTING IN ITS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AT PLUM ISLAND RESULTING IN A INCENDARY NUCULAR FUSION DEVICE BEING SET OFF THAT RESULTED IN THE INCENERATION OF PLUM ISLAND... BY WHICH TIME IT WAS ALLREADY TOO LATE AS INFESTED DEAR TICKS MANAGED TOO ESCAPE THE PLUM ISLAND NUCULAR INCENERATION STERALIZATION AND TERMINATION PROTOCALL RESULTING IN THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF LYME DISEASE BEING RELEASED AS AN AMERICAN BIO WEAPON ON THE AMERICAN PUBLIC...      BIO WARFARE IS TERRIFYING... SO IS BIO NUCULAR WARFARE...
Nuh uh
Society: who let the coronavirus loose?!? That one scientist that accidentally spilled an entire box of Covid-19: 💀💀💀
Love the "resident evil" reference.
The next? The last pandemic was man made,  it also created a new species willing sheep.
Crazy that people were being ostracized and deemed conspiracy theorists for the lab leak theory not too long ago. Gotta be careful what our governments and other organizations such as the WHO push as being the truth.
Isn't the previous pandemic technically man-made as well?
Info Hazard..more like a BioGatesHazard
what do you mean the NEXT one...  🇨🇳👀
The last one wasn't?
AMONGUS?
As if the previous one wasn't man made. 🙄
The last pandemic was man made
The story Life Artificial has a setting where artificial plague after artificial plague devastated the world. Countries collapse into quarantined city states. Everybody wears high tech masks all the time, just in case. And the health authorities rule the city with an iron fist. It's a vivid description of how the world could look if we don't get this right.
its DyingLight all over again
The last pandemic was man made …
covid was man made in a lab.
grimace shake
What? Was the original title not fearmongering enough for you sell outs? Gotta get that conspiracy theorist engagement?
You assume covid was not man made?
Lmao...the NEXT😂😂😂😂😂 like the last one wasn't lol
I'm genuinely shocked at how civil the comments are. Edit: oh, it's because they changed the title and thumbnail to be way closer to potential controversy a day after upload
It has happened in late 2019 early 2020. Whuhan with covid. Also in these so called secret laboratories are funded by foreign countries looking for the biological weaponry. It will repeatedly happen till humanity can't inoculate against the threat.
MonkaS
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
This one was manmade too wdym
And somehow you still believe the last one wasn’t?
The last pandemic was also man made. Why u think China just so happens to blame Laos for the virus just cuz their northern bats are covid's closest relative? China been invading those parts of Laos for many decades now. They likely took the virus from those northern batcaves and brought them back to their homecountry to make a good fortune $$. Well if backfired and bit the whole world into its axx. Try encourage your goverments to keep an eye on these issues cuz I aint goin through another pandemic with this species.
There are LOTS of children asked to build iPhones everyday in China!
Looks like Kyle Hill beat you guys to the punchline!
I have a suggestion; I'm really curious about how the human brain works. If possible, could you make a video about the human brain? I know that the brain is very complicated so you couldn't fit everything into just one video, but maybe a series going over different parts of the brain would be interesting. I hope you take my suggestion into consideration, even if you don't end up making a video about it.
What's really scary is someone making a virus for show and putting all the danger in the vaccine
The stupidity of people around the world has shown terrorists how effective this will be. You "medicai freedom" and anti vaxxers out there have proven that.
WAIT, the "NEXT ONE"? The last one was pretty evidently a lab leak. Are you saying the last one behaved like a natural virus? Especially with its asymptomatic infection rate and mutation rate? How about the fact the first infected were from nearby a lab that was "just happening" to be working on the virus in question? Lastly, the CCP said it wasn't, which is pretty damn good proof it was.
It’s going to be man made…again
Covid was developed in labs funded by the US and released in China during the 2019 Wuhan games to weaken the Chinese economy and create anti-Chinese hate.
Hey Kurzgesagt, after this video, you need to make another about fearmongering, so people can understand that it isn't what is happening here. Maybe show that lockdowns are good and it didn't hurt a generation of kids, also, that things like social distancing was based in science and not politics. I just got another idea, what about a video to explain how science can be used as propaganda so we can learn how to spot them. So many topics to explore, keep up the good work and your coffers full.
China lab moment
I feel like higher BSL setup is ignored after watched 😂
"Bio-technology ain't what's so bad  Like all technology, it's in the wrong hands"  - Jello Biafra and Sepultura, "Biotech is Godzilla"
Can you guys please do a video on how quickly vaccinated humans turned on unvaccinated ones, calling them terrible names and suggesting they should all die, and then how the unvaccinated turned out to be correct when being hesitant? Since it's all been proven without a shadow of a doubt now? I find it a fascinating phenomenon.
The last pandemic WAS man made.  WFT?
Just like the last one
TOTALLY different from nuclear weapons.  It is not possible to make a fission or fusion bomb in your basement.
80,000 hours is cool.
Next one? Last one?
The last pandemic was man made
next?
Attempting to constrain distribution of any class of information in the modern, fully connected world is the purest form of futility. Censorship has NEVER worked, which is why, even before the internet, all our most restricted and "secure" U.S. nuclear weapons secrets made it into the hands of the Soviet Union.. You are way too late to put this genie back in the bottle, and it is the height of absurd hubris to suggest that it is possible. WORST KURZGESAGT  VIDEO EVER.
Few years too late. Covid has the title.
who says the last one wasnt?
"The next pandemic" bro this last pandemic was man-made.
5:38 Literally the game The Division.
The previous pandemic was manmade
Why no intro...
Covid is man made too! That’s what USAID funded in Wuhan, China until 2019. It’s case in US Supreme Court. The whole interview recording is on YouTube.
First video without the kurzgesagt intro, feeling sad :(
um but covid was man made/altered lol. it’s hard to deny where it originated, a lab leak lol
The last one was man made too
and the first one wasnt?
You appear to be 1 pandemic too late for that title
The last pandemic was man made.
Great video, but maybe calm down with the title and thumbnail, it’s kinda clickbait-y, no offense.
This video leaves out the fact that most gene synthesis companies will only sell to universities and laboratories. And genetic synthesis companies will check your genetic sequence before synthesizing it to ensure you are not creating pathogens. Genetic synthesizers are even harder to obtain. And even if you had the genome of the virus, creating it is not something that the average joe in a basement can make. Reagents and equipments are again only sold to laboratories and cost tens of thousands of dollars. Censorship is not the way to go.
Wait a minute people keep saying the last pandemic was man made. How was Covid man made?
the next will be manmade, so like the previous one?
So was the last one...
Just stop selling the genetic material to anyone and everyone
ALL pandemics are man-made.
Here I had to submit an affidavit for using the 3d printer because you could potentially make a gun from it.
Maybe this is the great filter
Ha yes, the new title and thumbnail are a lot more clickbait, well done.
I'll never be able to say how much I love this channel. I speak about it to all my friends, discuss on the videos topics with those who already know it and those who don't always tell me that this channel is completely incredible. Thank you for your work 🫶🏻
No, not "anyone" has access to this stuff, unless if by "anyone" you mean your donors.
love the animations
This leginimately reminds me of the premise of The Divison. One of my favorite games. Guy decides y'know what? How about I create this virus and spread it on dollar bills on Black Friday? Killing a metric crap ton of people.
The last one was too, lol.
You missed "also" before "will be man made."
Uh...the last one already was?
You mean eventually let us know that they've had control over biology
And so was the last one
I mean.. the last pandemic was man made too so..
Video sponsored by the Bill & Melinda gates fondation?
prediction or threat?
Basically you are calling for censorship
The last one already was
Yo, scientists, give me not growing kittens, I want the kittens to stay that way forever, forget ethics, you can do it, make it happen.
Wasn’t the last one man-made? Lol
Yes, once again, limit liberties. I don't care if the next pandemic is around the corner, let the people experiment, it will only mean that retarded fuckers who refused to stay inside the house for a single month and let the pandemic end are gonna die. Honestly the world is aching for a culling. People are more and more retarded, selfish.. there's always a better way of doing things then limiting freedoms, share data, but develop systems to combat sudden pandemics, how about anti-pandemics, infectious viruses who get inside non essential oragans and force your body to produce anti bodies for the very same virus. Regulate, do not restrict, we all know what happens when you do.  Edit: you don't see people getting restricted from using computers just because they could write computer viruses, instead we combat them with greater security. Everything is a war in the end, and this will be too.
The next pandemic? You sure you don't mean the last pandemic? Come on Kurzgesagt?
7:26 AMONGUS
thanks for the ideas lol
sweet tooth type beat
You do the vaccines, I think I'll pass.
hi as a long time subscriber can i request a video about Ocean?
This last one was man made, of course the next one will be too
Like the last one wasn't...
Corona virus is man made 😒😮‍💨
Didn't even know I could do this for the same price as a car. Boutta make the new super covid 💀
This is the first very bad video from you. Not because of accidental mistakes; those happen. This video is plainly wrong and has a lot of disinformation. ~2:30 "imagine [...]" yes, everybody. this is the only good part in the video. imagine exactly that. why don't we teach our children how to build that in school? who is preventing us? (additionally the children would directly see how cheap the phone would actually be, if you do not have to pay for marketing and brand name. not to mention all the intentionally bad design choices to make it harder to repair and maintain.)
Did Kurzgesagt humans always have fingernails ...? 😮 'tis progress!
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made", yeah, we know, just like the last one...
lol, did no one tell these guys that COVID was made by gain of function research at the Wuhan lab?
Sure seems like the last one was too...
Last pandemic was also man made
The last one already was
Bit click baitey!!
So was the last one
The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made*  The last one was man made. The Virus mutation was abnormal exactly like the aids virus. Man made garbage by men obsessed with microorganisms or hatred of humanity.
Why next? Wasn't the previous one already?
Going to be the plot of call pf duty advanced warfare
You mean like last right? Wuhan lab?
0:48 The “climate change resistant crops” shown here are growing in a desert environment. Plant stomata density and and resulting Water Use Efficiency are correlated to CO2 concentration- more CO2 makes for more efficient use of water, higher drought tolerance and more growth.
The last one was man made...
Ruff riders!
Well that's an incredibly irresponsible title if I ever saw one
Like the last one?
Shouldn't the title be "The Next Pandemic Will ALSO Be Man Made"
Thank you for creating such informative content for free 💖
Tell us about this vacine? because ever since some people have had it they seem to become ill and die from blod clots and heart attacks
I remember ps4 had a program/app that could be turned on to allow the hardware to be used to help process the human genome project, while you slept or weren't using the console.
7:23 AMOGUS
What do you mean "next" xD
Shout out to that boys scout who built a nuclear reactor in their backyard and contaminated their neighborhood
This is why need need to focus on becoming a multiplanetary species asap. It will mean if some idiot accidentally or intentionally unleashes a super plague,  we'd be far more likely to survive as a species.
Why use them to kill everyone when u can use them for social and financial adjustment. Oh wait..
Imagine being a Chinese doctor playing with biological material, accidentally killing 7 million people and crushing world’s economy for two years. Now that’s what I call “a bad day at work”.
I love this channel
Wasn’t the last pandemic also made in china by man lol
Remember everyone. B*ll and M*linda G*tes fund this channel. They also have a big financial incentive to get the V out to everyone. Coincidence? 🤔  (The channel block users who comment about this, even though they have made a statement about this, thats why I needed to censor their names)
The last one wasnt?
I already have 11 posters, 4 pins (also ordered the new pin), big duck and small duck plushies, black hole plushy, earth mug, earth beanie and 2 calendars, so I'll hold off on buying any new posters for a while. Although I am interested in the quarter sun and black hole posters, so I can put them on top of my quarter earth and moon posters to make a circle out of them.
I thought the last pandemic was man-made. Anywho. Good work as always.
the last pandemic was man made
Thanks for letting us know, Bill!
The next pandemic? As if the one we just had wasn’t absolutely man made…
Wasn't the last pandemic man made?
did anyone notice that the title changed?
Kurzgesagt has a signature sentence "Well, it's complicated"
Nearly as good as Simpsons prediction
imdb9.1，德国最牛逼的动画频道
making this video like the last pandemic wasnt man made too lol
A terrorist could spray dozens of people throughout New York City with viruses and they would unknowingly spread it across the world (NYC has 3 airports). It would spread even faster than the coronavirus, since that one infected only a single person at first.
Well yes... this last one was most likely man-made as well sooo
here from Brasil i love your  videos and the way u guys abord the tems but unfortunately for now the capital and the money speks strongly and opens the possibility to create a huge industry that creates an issue and sell the cure... been this more likely to happen then a civil person create an biologic weapon intencionaly or not...
3:34 Did it come from nature or from a lab that works on corona viruses. Are you really asking that question Kurzgesagt ?? 😅
🤣🤣🤣 the current pandemic was made by humans in a lab. Why are we still lying about the events of the last 3 years
Wasn't this one too?
3:15 you can👀
Like the last one wasn't man-made? Nice try.
Yes. The "next" pandemic.
It does exist a lamp used for killing virus an bacteria, but humans can't be exposed to it. As well as solar radiation causes skin burns, these lamps can cause them too, not as deep a solar burns though. However, UV lamps produce ozone, which is irritating for eyes and the respiratory tract causing cough, asthma reaction and breathing difficulty. So your scene of a  uv-lamp in a room with two people in might be misleading
"you should be tracked", and then the graphics of "Go home". Its sad to see Kurzgesagt promoting an authoritative police state.
The last pandemic was man-made? We know it came from a lab leak from wuhan.
The last pandemic was man made
Glad there are ppl smart enough to work in these fields, because it couldn’t be me lol
Its not a debate were it came from, not unless you are on China's pocket.
8:01 Wouldn't you need to wear sunglasses around these UV lamps?
the last pandemic was man made you mug!
The most recent one was man made too
the next? like the Wuhan virus that was made in Wuhan in the Wuhan lab of virology that studies corona viruses wasn't already manmade??
Thank you! ❤
Did you seriously change the video name AND the thumbnail?
If there's anything obvious today it's that attempts contain information only spreads it further. (This is a good thing.)
you forgot the word ALSO in the video title. It should be "The Next Pandemic Will Also Be Man Made" since Covid 19 was made in a lab in China.
Easy bet. Last pandemic was manmade. Tuff.
Implying Covid wasn't? Lmao it got out from the Wuhan Lab and no ammount of lying hides it.
The last one was
Low quality video
Guys, I'm very sorry to say it but this video is absolute bullshit. So very alarmistand I've already seen some comments saying bibliography is not good either. If this is the direction you are going to take, you are not different from every other account that spread misinformation. The rest of the videos are perfect, you always say interesting and accurate things but this time has een different.I HOPE IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. EVER.
I was thinking the same thing. Regulation on this level(the one proposed in the video) will hinder the progress of many new innovations and slow it down. It will also become centralized and be with only specific people that the people in authority want. We can't always guarantee that these people will always have the best of interest in their minds for the common population. It's the same as a king having all of authority and we can only count on it that the king will not become a tyrant.
Oh, is Fauci already funding the next one?
well the last pandemic was man made
Let me guess United nations sponsored this
As a Bioinformatician, this video feels like a blatant fear-mongering opinion piece. It sets out to get you afraid of a topic (microbiology) that you don't understand, downplays the actual difficulty/expertise/labour/resources required to research viruses, all with an apparent agenda against free sharing of information & open-science.
...like the last one
The most recent pandemic was man made...
The goverment is planning the next one I suppose
*gets a temu ad right before the vid to remind me about the last manmade one*
I like the nudge at the Umbrella Corporation on the building, small subtle things like that are always a smile !
The next one?
Dude, even the previous one was. lol.
the last one was too
I hate to break it to you, but the previous pandemic has been proven to be man-made
Just like the last one.
Thanks but you need to change the title. Because the overwhelming proof shows the last one was a lab leak. We have way more proof that it was from a lab than it was natural. I have yet to find a scientist in the field that thinks otherwise.
The previous pandemic was created in a lab. This video is one pandemic too late.
$100 on 2120 pandemic
The most recent pandemic was also man made, FYI
Hi Kurzgesagt, I wanted to say thank you, as a university student your videos are a big reason I want to pursue science.
Too many butthurts in this comment section that K didn't abide by your half-assed theories about the origin of Covid Y'all seem to have *A LOT* of trouble dealing with the world around you
I would love to see yall look Into some of the stuff RFK Jr says because it's pretty interesting questions
I definitely agree on the video. Some paranoid people think COVID was made in a lab.  No. If a virus was done in a lab to harm people, we wouldn't lose 0.1% of humanity. We could lose 99%.
It's not that scary. That data that some really, really, really stupid bad actor decides to use to release a bad disease (which will almost certainly infect themselves, their compatriots, and everyone else - you can't target bioweapons), because it is already out there, means it will be easy to create defenses and vaccines for it. On top of that, you have to consider the overall danger level. People just aren't that hell-bent on destroying one another.  Don't believe me?  Stop and think, how many people in, say, the past 10 years of your life have you walked past? Every single one of those people could have killed you. A short blade unexpectedly to your throat, you would have bled out in seconds. Now, how many of those people tried? None? Gee, does that sound like a world full of people who are willing to kill you? How many times have people set your house on fire while you were asleep?  It's trivially easy to do, and they've had every single night of every single day to give it a go, and all the people who live around you or are even just passing through the area had the opportunity.  You get it?  It's not hard to kill people.  But, there are simply not very many people who are willing to do it.  Comparing bioweapons to nuclear weapons is fundamentally flawed in very serious ways.  First, giving people information about how to develop nuclear weapons does not aid in defending against nuclear weapons.  With bioweapons, it does. Nuclear weapons can be targetted, and defending against them is nearly impossible, while bioweapons can not be targetted (which destroys any person using them to get an advantage for themselves because it will kill them too) but can be defended against IF the knowledge exists on how to guard against them - which is the whole point of gain of function research.  It is completely ridiculous to propose that you could prevent someone who wanted the genetic sequence of a deadly virus from getting it.  They would only need 1 person infected with that virus, or some tissue from them, and then they could sequence it themselves in a garage.  Then, you would have this big system "controlling access to the information" and total confidence that the bad actor definitely doesn't have the sequence, so you would not look at them as a potential danger.  Meanwhile they're running breeder reactors in their basement to try to bring about the apocalypse.  It's just a gigantic waste of resources that doesn't actually protect or help anyone.
This one already is
The Next Pandemic Will Be, Like The Previous One: Man Made
FoldIt? Never mind.
You know those videos in sci-fi stories that explain why humans were so great before they went extinct? Kurzgesagt is just making those, it's perfect.
The 19 was created in Wuhan lab
👎
The last pandemic WAS manmade. Facepalm.  Even found evidence of it being funded by the PLA.  Doesn't get much more manmade than 'we were developing a beta-version bioweapon and accidentally infected our own people, and intentionally let it spread for a month before we locked down travel'.  Unsubbed for bad info.  I used to like your videos on space phenomena, try putting some truth in your diet.
I'm pretty sure the last one was man-made.
Again⁉️
Dont you mean  "the last pandemic we had was manmade"
The next?
More foolish nonsense….well done
the previous one was too though..
is, was
The last one was too
Fun fact, Covid had been studied since the 1960s and had mutiple papers published explaining how it could not have a propper vaccine created for it due to its' mutation rate, as well as guidelines for an "accidental release". This was revisited in the 1980s. 40 years later we "created in record time" a vaccine.
That animated pug’s eyes were so cursed! 😂😂😂  Love your work! You guys and gals rock!!!
One of those frog farmers/breeders from tiktok has the chance to do the funniest thing ever
Are you sure the last one wasn’t a test run?
The last pandemic was also man made 🇨🇳
I'm not fooled by his acting. That lab guy dropped that beaker on purpose!
Then tell Bill Gates, your Sponsor, to stop it
People who misuse knowledge, information, media, spread misinformation, stifle open discussion about certain things, are ALREADY doing it. And it is people who have control that work to strengthen their control, and further misuse power. If the people who talk on mass media do not mention your natural immunity and health and well beaing of regular people, then there is a big problem. They dont like to talk about Vitamins, minerals, sunlight, nature, eating and drinking healthy, and avoiding stress and fear. Are these things not what prevents you from being sick? lets talk about that for a while.
It think that it would be acceptable to carry such risk and NOT live under a totalitarian surveillance state with some 'experts' and a bunch of people elected by charisma in charge of such a powerful government organization who are human and 100% guaranteed to abused and use such powers any time they view it as convenient for themselves as they only work in those fields as careers because they are only concerned truly about themselves. Real movements elect a leader based on a cause, deal with that cause the go back to their lives. Today we have frauds and power hungry deceivers wanting to control these systems for life like some kind of special class of society. Well, no more power to such things, I'd rather the citizens had bio-weapons and the government didn't.
so was the last one @cia @nicedocuments
The last one already was
Bruh last pandemic was man made too.
seems like a lot of experts have serious issues with this video. well I'm sure all their other videos are fine. now if you don't mind I'm going to read this news article on how wet streets cause the rain.
So just like the last one?
Itna mehenga rhta hai poster
Only government experts should have access to research and everyone else should be tracked at all times by the government experts. If you knew a thing or two about history you'd know the government experts are the most malicious ones. But then again, this channel gets funded by them and they're g*rmans so lol.
Who's gonna tell em
Dang they changed the title
Factually provable that the last one was man made....really Kurtgesagt?
*Paid by the Gates Foundation*
I usually buy something from your merch store every 6 months or so as a treat for myself. I love every single item that I have bought from you guys, keep up the good work!
Turdgezshat in a bombshell
“Will also be a man made pandemic”.
What says the last pandemic wasnt man made? What's saying the vaccine wasnt motivated by economic value? Nvm the fact the last vaccine for covid was full of crap
This is essentially just fearmongering and it's despicable. If a world ending virus is made it's going to be made by a government funded project just like the atomic bomb. I personally work in this field and there already are regulations being put in place daily to prevent any average joe from doing something like this. Not to mention, it's about 1000x harder to do stuff like this in a garage than you're trying to make it seem. All this video does is create public fear and all public fear does is create irrational regulations which only impede the development of good technology while governments still do whatever the hell they want behind the curtain.
The last pandemic was man made..
Me @ 3 minutes in: I hope there an Umbrella Corporation logo somewhere...
well ferb I know what we are going to do today

The last pandemic was man made
I ended up getting an ad that only plays on this channel. It's for a channel "Data time".
The previous too.
first time, i feel like in a nutshell video is purely just to scare some lawmakers,  its kinda wierd....  overly negative video
Playing god has always been, and will always be, the downfall of man.
Covid was man-made in a lab and escaped from Wuhan, we know the drill.
Kurzgesagt, Thank you so much for uploading videos.🤗🤗 I am so grateful for your Hardwork for us 💜💜
THIS pandemic was man made!
"Next pandemic will be man made" yeah this one totally wasn't.
C*Vid was man made…
The last Pandemic was made in China and funded by America, so thanks!
Doesn't help that we have about 30% of the population that is pro-virus.
Also, i think the worst bioweapons are done and will be done by big corporations that disregard everything for profit. Cyberpunk was a warning
But the last pandemic was man made!
Previous one was also man-made
Pardon me, sir, but what about the last one? Which has been all but proven was a leak. Hmmmmmm
Wasn't this video's title and thumbnail related to nuclear weapons yesterday?
Thanks
no one bats an eye of corona being lab made.
This video left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't work in the field or have a bio degree like many of the other negative comments seem to, but this just felt far more like fearmongering than actual information, and I don't think it's up to the standard this channel normally has.
Probably the very first video from you guys I just disliked. Dunno whether to start with specifically mentioning the iPhone in stead of just smartphone, or the incredibly manipulated number of 7mil casualties. Or advocating to monitor people, in stead of just the material, however good the cause may be. Among many others.
Covid WAS created BY HUMANS
The *next* one?
isn't this pandemic man made already?
control over information is an extremely heavy topic...
yeah the last one was
It already was man made... Covid
The last one was man made as well
You could’ve very easily have made this video in 2019 and it would’ve been as accurate, because it applies exactly the same to Covid
Yeah, because tracking works so well with all these sanctions and KYC procedures in place /end of sarcasm Additionally, what would be the point of tracking after the dogs are out?
Uhh, the last pandemic was man made...
Huh? Wasn't the title different? Something like bio nuclear bomb. Why did they change the title?
Why the thumbnail and title change? It was fine.
bill gates and china man made xD
Modern Fight?
Finally! I was looking for a plan to take over the world!
"The Next" i thought we are still debating if the last one wasn't either?
yeah, just as the last pandemic
The last one was man made...
Do you they think that the last pandemic wasn't man made...
The next?... The LAST pandemic was man made.
You mean this pandemic was man made*
Um, the last pandemic was already manmade.
Kruzgesagt is fear-mongering?! You should be aware of the paywall that scientific journals created. Every publication and every article has a price to access. And you can’t be certain that that’s the one you need.  And what’s your proposed solution? Total control of information. Throw people in prison for “bad DNA”. And who is to determine what DNA is Ok and what isn’t?  There are countless things that are dangerous with readily available equipment: computer viruses, war trucks, fire bombs. Should we have licensing for every PC and Mac, ban automobiles and gasoline with alcohol?
Was not the previous pandemic man-made ????
Clinical trials take years to complete and 90% of them fail... it is NOT so simple as this video implies.
Considering who sponsors Kurtzgesagt, this video can be taken as something between predictive programming and a threat.
You just want the companies of the billionaires that fund you to eventually be the only ones able to work in the field. I'm happy more people are noticing how you intentionally exaggerate, mislead and push agendas.
Can you make a video about next Alzheimer's my grandma has it😢
The last one was man made, you shameless Bill Gates shill
Despite the claims in this video, I guarantee that anything of true value, whether for good or bad, is not shared. That's human nature.
Sorry: After seeing how viruses can be used by governments and corporations to brutally impose unthinkable restrictions against the population of the planet overnight and even make them love oligarchs that steal from and abuse them, I'm at the point of questioning how real viruses are or at least anything we learned about them. If I see dead bodies littering the streets and proof the government didn't poison its own people to do that, okay I'll believe a pandemic is happening... till then I'll never believe in anything being called a pandemic ever again.
I thought the last Pandemic was man made? 🤔😏
The last pandemic was man made.
8:01 I can't imagine the amount of conspiracy theories adding UV lights everywhere would create 💀💀💀
the last one was man made fyi
Can you make a video about altimeters
The next one? The last one was man-made...
Covid was already manmade
The last pandemic was man made (Wuhan), so there's every reason to expect the next one will be...
The last pandemic was man made too
The “next”..  they are All man made.  demonically made!
The LAST pandemic was ALREADY man made 😂😂😂😂😂
Wasn't this called something else?
❤️
The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made... just like the last one...
Look, we Biologists all know this and we don't talk about this, because we also know that the more people find out the higher the chances of ending humankind with bioweapons. In a nutshell, this video has done much more harm than good. Almost like it was planned so purposefully.
This is called predictive programming, and what better channel to use for it than this Gates-funded propaganda mill?
Oh, we all know the last pandemic was man made & on purpose
Pfizer might make a new virus. Yes, the people that helped make the vaccine and made massive bank from it. (There's a video of supposesly Pfizer people admitting to this going around aswell online, would love to think it's fake but it unfortunately seemed sort of convincing)
The last pandemic was man made.
"Video made in 2018."
I thought it was going to be difficult to cause human extinction but now I know that it's actually a reasonable goal. Thank you for the information.
are u denying the US report that the last pandemic was not man made. Covid was a man made leak in wuhan
A video by Open Philantropy
You mean this one wasn't?
The last pandemic was man made 😂
I didn't know i could make lethal viruses at home I'll search it :)
Uhhhh Biden I hope you're listening dude
Why did you change the title and the thumbnail within 24 hrs?
The last pandemic was also man made
Current pandemic is man made.
This sounds like 25% of all action movies!
As a molecular biologist working on gene therapy using viral vectors, I can assure you that it is extremely difficult to avoid being tracked when ordering genetic components. Even though our biosafety level 1 is officially defined as "non-pathogenic material that is unlikely to harm the environment and humans," we are still obligated to report each case to the appropriate authorities and maintain meticulous documentation of our biosafety level 1 experiments. These experiments, which are considered safe according to the defined biosafety standards, are subjected to frequent monitoring by regulatory bodies. As you can imagine, things get even more strict when working with higher biosafety levels like viruses that target human cells. This time the kurzgesagt clip is more entertaining than informative.
You guys should team up with Lumin for your posters! You guys would make AMAZING posters with them. They're the company that also works with Displate.
Are we really ruling out covid19 wasnt from the wuhan covid lab lol
The last pandemic was man made...
We need a preschool version for science-fearing Americans
The last one was too.
Lol like none before have been.. xD Take ur hydro gel shampoo and vegan steaks and ul be like supper man
Similar to the last one
You mean, like in the 2019 ?
Uhh the last one was..
Kurzgesagt, are you assuming that covid isn't manmade? 🤔
Would've been nice not to talk about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the past tense, and saying it's mild.  I understand it might be mild compared to other diseases out there or what might come in the future. But with the huge platform you have, you should be more careful not to downplay the damage it has and continues to inflict on all of us.
The last one was man made.
Oh I see, the solution is a global information and surveillance state. How much is Bill paying now to peddle vaccines?
Yes, the NEXT one 😉
Says the channel who is supported by Gates foundation
pretty much what my first thought when nvidia proposed ai assisted biostuff at the comfort of home
3:15 that’s definitely going into an out of context video
The NEXT one will be, boy I have some bad news for you.
The Wuhan virus killed 7 million. I wonder how many were killed by our stupid lockdown and vaccination response.
Haven’t watched videos yet but just want to say: evidence is pointing toward the lab in Wuhan being the reason COVID-19 was released. So that was probably the first man made pandemic
wdym next
Bringing Dying Light into the real world IKZ
China already did this.
This  breaks (in a very odd and worrying tone) from a usual kurzgesagt tone. This is absolute FUD and advocates to limit the progression and access of science to a certain class.  We know from history that this is catastrophic and bad for society.  None of the suggested mitigations are valuable to stop someone making a doomsday virus, only to limit the progression and access of science to a certain class.
lol @ the bat**** easter egg
Fun fact: the last pandemic was man made.
Bill Gate's Malaria?
The last plandemic was also man made, this is 100 per cent a propaganda channel.
The next one will be manmade? You mean just like the last one we just had?
Oh, the NEXT pandemic will be man made!
Like P4 labs but it was complotist
The last pandemic was man made... Patient zero was an employee at the Wuhan lab. We can stop pretending bats or pangolins had anything to do with the onset of SARS-CoV-2.
The last one was man made too, but of course you will protect your masters. Traitor.
Last pandemic was also manmade😂
Last one already was?
In europe it is illegal to have private laboratory and even on universities if you want to do GMO you need permission from the government every time. What is more GMO is quite hard to do even in laboratory. Not every protein can be made in bacterias or yeast, what is more it is hard to put animal DNA code to bacteria and make it work
Kurzgesagt always tweaks with their thumbnails and titles, but this ones a misstep: it's got the antivaxxers and covid conspiracists out of their caves...
The next will be - the last already was.
Uh, didn't Covid start because of a lab leak?
❤
COVID-19 was a lab leak.
This channel sold out. What happened to you guys? Used to be good before 2020.
Kurzgesagt taught me more bio tech in 11 mins, than I had learned in 2 years of school 😭😭😭
kurzgesagt channel my beloved
The next too?
the next one? you sure?
I really don’t think it’s up for debate anymore whether or not the China virus originated in a lab or not…Yes, of course it did.
I think the autocorrect messed up with the title. I think you meant the last pandemic was man made!
OMG, not again! Stop saying we need vaccins as fast as possible. We know how toi do them fast. Ensuring they are safe takes half a génération and it can't bé sped UP! You need to accept it and stop saying bullshit!
You forgot the "Again" at the end of your video title.
Did they change their thumbnail?
2:53 What’s going on down there?? 😳
Ever heard of Covid 19? 😂
"There's no reason scientists today can't handle really dangerous biological technology in a similar way..."  Sorry, but no. There is every reason. Yet another use case for AI. Who would have thought that building something that can do superhuman thinking in narrow domains could be leveraged anywhere with disastrous results when unchecked!? *shocked* We're already using AIs to do search space work, wherein they generate candidates for research that are promising based upon success criteria inferred from pattern matching across all known pathogens. This is happening in materials science to find superconductor candidates, materials with high tensile strength, tunable optical properties, and, yes, in biology for both pharmaceuticals and viruses. That AI software is only going to become more robust and the source code is not that hard to get a hold of. A bioterrorist with a drive to end humanity and a mediocre intellect could, in a few short years, engineer a capable virus and then order the parts required (all innocuous) and do the final assembly. It's one of the major three human-born existential threats we face: AGI, nanotech, and biotech. Each has far more bad outcomes than good, and each is disastrously imbalanced in a game theoretic sense: it's far easier for the attacker than the defender.
The previous one was man made LOL
The level of authoritarianism from these Germans is tragic. These writers need to suppress their desire to control others. You can pretend you want to track people and control information, and take forceful sweeping government measures for the good of everyone, but deep down it is not about doing good. It is about control.  The human desire to wield power (ie. Control) will always find an "honorable" disguise for its intentions.
Well I hope they don't come up with any solutions before my plan to blackmail the U.N. with my super virus that transform humans into koala bears comes to fruition. I mean you have no idea how much time and money I put into my underground lair under that frikken volcanic island.
Well the last pandemic was man made. There has been widespread evidence that covid-19 originated from the lad in wuhan....
What do you mean the next pandemic? Surely you know of Covid?
I ain't a conspiracy theorist but this sus...
they changed the title or the thumbnail? or both? is it just me?
what do you mean by "the next? ...lol
You optimist kurz...
Stars Trek and Sneeze? I don't get it. What is Star Sneeze?
The next 😂
lol already grooming the sheep into thinking this will be normal, never forget Covid-19 was a bioweapon created in a Wuhan lab which the Chinese released to destroy the West...America also funded the labratory lol
The last pandemic was already man made. Anyone who still believes otherwise is living in fantasy land.   What are the chances it started naturally in the same place where there's a major coronavirus lab?   Probably about the same as winning a lottery.
The last pandemic was made by man, and people that fund you are involved.
We already had a man made pandemic. It was COVID
"The Next Pandemic Will Be Man Made" um well the last one was as well. Gain of function type research done at the Wuhan lab seems to have been the source of covid especially as the so called patient zero worked there.
The one before hand was man made as well
The next? How about the last one? Are you covering for Eco Health Alliance and Dr. Fauci?
The Covid 19 was man made, what you mean
ayooo! love the reference to umbrella corp. if any corporation brought about the demise of humanity thanks to uncontrollable biotech, it’d be them. lol
The picture of the front of the video JUST CHANGED
and  it will probably from China again…. Since COVID is already the second time
Wasn’t the last one man made??
This is incredibly scary and hopeful at the same time
7:26 amogus hehehe I am stuck in 2021 mentally
Wait whyd the thumbnail and title change
The human genome project was "completed" in 13 years, but it did not read the full human genome. It was an amalgam that was sort of a rough draft of a typical human genome and not a full human genome. It's amazing to me that a channel like this, which I respect in many ways -- though they make significant errors sometimes and have bad opinions masquerading as science sometimes -- can make a claim like that without giving any nuance. It means they were unaware or didn't care about the subtleties, which are both terrible, since the argument that immediately follows leans upon the claim. Anyway, back to the point: a full human genome has *still* not been sequenced today, though it's expected to happen this year. Google into this a bit for more information. We basically in the past have just found a template for the human genome and then we look for specific alleles in cheap lab tests to guess at specific genes within that template, but that leaves a lot of room for missing genes and surprises. No person in the history of humankind has had an accurate, full account of their dna as yet, but we're basically there now.
Humanity deserves a global, extinction level pandemic
The last pandemic was man-made so why is this news?
4:45 first time I've seen a cuss word in kurtzgesagt
The current pandemic was man made…
Bold of you to assume that the last one wasn't man made..
The next!?
I mean... the last pandemic was already man made... covid leaked from the Wuhan lab
First video I’m unhappy with. Bio hacking is as overhyped as AI. Yes it works wonders with a decade long career or a giant team. But forget about doing it in your garage. And ffs enough with the Covid lab leak bs. Our biotech is good but not a billion years of evolution good.
Yeah the last one was too
The next? What about the last?
The last pandemic was man made.
Already happening with the "vaccine".
This pandemic was man made. China made it in a lab. The US funded it with tax payer money. And the guy who helped create the virus (Fauci) is declared the hero for saving us from a virus he helped create.  But that's just a conspiracy theory right? Lol this world has been tricked and misled.
7:24 Among Us
Stronger than a nuke?
COVID WAS MAN MADE
Thumbnail is different 😅
No it won't.
I'm not even a subject matter expert and I can tell this isn't your best work. It was also disappointing to see the thumbnail changed after upload to something that pushes the fear-mongering message of the video even more. Better luck next time!
The last one was man made
THE LAST PANDEMIC WAS MAN MADE
"Bio technology is progressing at breakneck speed" Cure for common cold? No Cure for baldness? No Cure for... well... anything? No Whoa mankind, rein in the progress! You're breaking my neck and there is no cure for it.
Title and thumbnail changed
What do you mean "next"? You mean like the last one was??
The last one was man made so...
Great
I dunno about the updated title and thumbnail "the next pandemic will be man made / lab leak". Seems very baity and really not truthful about the arc of global pandemics. Especially since Avian influenza H5N1 seems like a possible next candidate.
I disliked this video because it is kinda promoting a "humanity will discover something that can help with climate change, don't worry about it" narative to the people. This doesn't matter if all the resources are depleted from the ground and all the Earth is as New York right now. We need to stop the economic growth and clean energy, that's the only thing that will help👍👍
It’s impossible to say where the next pandemic will come from. Natural pandemics have happened and will continue to happen in the future. But there is certainly ever increasing evidence that the pandemic we just experienced was man made and likely released by accident via a lab worker who accidentally infected themselves.
The 2020 pandemic was man made
The last one might have been too
The last pandemic was man made the fuck you smoking?
LMFAO, as if the last one wasn't man made.
This video is fearmongering propaganda. I cant believe you will go so low. I am really disappointed in this video. You compare this nuclear energy and represent hurdles in covid to "scientific debate" rather than pure CCP politics. This video is a classic fear inducing narrative that claim for safty by promoting regulation that will make sure small labs would never be able to compete with big bio tech firms.  Its disscusting
Are you shitting me? It was 100% confirmed by the FBI in the United States government. It came from the Wuhan lab. This has been known for like a month or so. Really guys??
the last one was
What are you talking about, the *next* pandemic? COVID-19 was man-made.
The Previous Pandemic Was Man Made
Nice timming. Just rewatched the Planet of The Apes trillogy.
THIS pandemic was manmade.
"The next pandemic will be man made" Been there, done that. That being said, Covid wasn't a monstrously dangerous illness as proposed. But the next one likely will be horrific, nearly impossible to combat AND since it's coming from China, they're already investing in making diseases that can target specific aspects within a population. For instance, it would only attack a specific race, a group with a specific trait, or even a relative age range. It's terrifying and should be enough to destroy whatever organization out there is doing that research.
And this pandamic was not man made and vaccines saved us. lol
I mean, the most recent panemic was man made...
We can expect great things from biotechnology! Terrible...yes, but great
The last one was man made
Feels like the title changed
Where is Bio nuclear?! Wtf??
This is just so rich. "Oh, yeah I mean we claimed Covid was literally equivalent to the pest, but actually it was relatively mild" because why would you need to acknowledge that you royally screwed up and tried to shake the pillars of liberal democracy out of fear. And after that we continue to "withhold information for your own good" because my god are these people ever transparent in their intentions. Yes, I am very certain that the guy who co-founded Facebook must only have the best of intentions when financing a video like this. It _really_ is not hard to see how he would make the jump from this to "Well, we are withholding _dangerous_ information from you in the virus sector, and privacy tools are also really dangerous and used by hackers and terrorists, we should restrict access to that too for your own good!". This whole video is a campaign against freely available information. Yes, there are dangers associated with free flow of information, but guess what? The pros far outweigh the risks here. Or maybe these people just got sick and tired that people had free access to information about the corona virus and were able to see it for what it really was, a flue. Maybe they hated the fact that because knowledge was so readily available they had to cancel their vaccine campaigns and those pesky protestors were trying to keep their freedom. If only we could limit their access to the virus data, well, then we could _really_ stir up the panic.  The whole premise of this video is beyond f*cked.
I would love to see a video about quantum computers
Imagine the Backyard scientist watches this Video
Imagine if COVID was actually man-made and they hid that from us. Boy wouldn't that be funny!
Did they change the title
Can you make a video on "If zombie virus can happen and how?"
The last one was also man made
Um it's obvious that this COVID-19 pandemic was man made.
The last one was manmade....
it was already done, but next one will be much bigger i guess.
But this pandemic was a man made lab leak. Why talking about the next one like it didn't already happen 😅
The last one was too!
Already was lol
the last one was too
This is the first video you have made that I really did not like.  Smacks of vaccine propaganda.
3:16 "Hey Ferb I know what we're gonna do today"
Open Philanthropy was founded by Cari Tuna and her husband committed in their 20s to the Giving Pledge, the campaign started by Bill Gates
Greaaaaat.... the solution is more vaccines....
Top 5 trending in one day???
"...Will be man made" Just like the last one!!
I don't know much about biology, but I can say that, despite what the news or social media might make you believe, there are more people trying to do good than do harm in this world. So, if there's some malicious researcher trying to unleash a new deadly virus, there will be many others trying to come up with solutions. At least there's some solace in that.
WHT IF COVID WAS ALSO MANMADE?
Kurzgesagt is the only channel on YouTube that can: 1. Teach me about biology  2. 31.4 Seconds later tell me how closely related I am to a flying lemur
The last pandemic was man made too.
This past pandemic was also man-made
Covid is man made
The art is a bit different today
Some may say the last pandemic was already manmade, but lets call them conspiracy terrorists
Did the Gates foundation tell you to make this while acting as if COVID wasn't the fault of human "error"?
0:11 The Wuhan leak recontruction 😂
Just like this covid-19 was sense the department of education and fbi said so.
you absolute tool. the LAST pandemic was already manmade.
The previous pandemic was man made…
So was the last one.
Uncle Ted was right... R.I.P.
Newsflash: the last pandemic was man made.
tbh it’s way easier to control information and lab equipments. let the academia only to have access to it
Without even starting the video, me: “So was the last one.”
You guys are amazing.
Umbrella corp -Raccoon city origins
"new batshit virus discovered" thank you animator for your hard work
pov your an antivaxer 💀
We all got tested by China sponsored Wuhan Virus or so call Covid-19.
You know... it doesn't even need to affect humans directly... diseases aimed at wheat, rice & corn would be pretty effective at wiping out vast swathes of humanity... or how about diseases aimed at those ever-pollinating bees...?   Excuse me while I curl into a ball & blubber for a while...
Covid19 should be used as a learning opportunity
Interestingly, computer viruses are very similar to biological viruses. They manipulate the system and cause errors. They can occur naturally or be synthesized by malicious entities, Its just a fun fact I felt like mentioning.
where can I access to the poster?
And that's why this video is sponsored by Plague Inc. The Table Top Chemistry Game!
Catgirls, when?
Lemur? you say whaaaaaaaaaaattt
Pretty awful advice.  We do not censor knowledge, nor save it for the elites.
You should produce videos on subjects like Astronomy and Atomic particles. This is another alarmist propaganda video, just like your far leftist migrant one.
No Intro :(
3:45 Mild virus that affects mostly elders, sick & other useless civilians who are birden for age-sex pyramid @ Lets sell useless masks, lock down everyone and kill economy!
The future of war.
Oops, kurz's agenda slipped again. More regulation is the wrong path.
Yeah, it felt like someone paid you to make this video to scare people away from biotech and biohacking, naysayers like peacecorp and those who sponsored this video have been up against scientists since forever, nothing new.
If information about electronics was also freely available, we would be able to make iPhones at uni
Was that umbrella corp
I disagree with how this information is being presented, biohacking should be monitored but not abolished.
Kurzgesagt, thank you for teaching me how to create a more destructive nuclear weapon! I'll test this in my back yard now, thanks!
I bet almost all new viruses will come from china here on out until they are decimated multiple times.
unsubscribed, i dont like being fed CCP bullshit.
Ok new animator totally
This video is a monument to everything wrong with Kurzgesagt: - Scientism; - Scientific ultra-optimism; - Optimist moral nihilism; - The absolute incapacity to analyse even one of our social and global problem down to its self-evident root-cause: capitalism; - The incapacity to see the the biggest danger for anything future-related is that it will be used for capitalist purposes by the global capitalist class; - The spreading of propaganda about the past (nuclear technology being controlled in order to prevent evil villains to make an atomic bomb in their backyard and not because the US didn't want other global power with possibly conflicting - capitalist - interests having the same firepower than them - read: URSS - and they keep doing it -read: Iran-) and the future (again, evil villain with a backyard-built bio-weapon, instead of capitalists being capitalists and using bio-weapons to make profit, or to protect profit from workers' demands); - The video itself being financed by a philantropic organization = rich people fighting the concept itself of fiscal redistribution, welfare State and democratic allocation of resources.
I swear for the most part Scientist always do one thing wrong; They never ever consider themselves or their peers as a threat vector.  Banks and Tech companies always view their own as a possible threat.
They should make a bomb that turns normal people into the worst that humanity has to offer. A bomb that chemically alters the mind like that of the infection in the comic series “Crossed.”
Thanks for everything you do Kurzgesagt!
2:32 I wish this was all technology
Love the videos, man. Keep it up!!!
"it's data time!"
Wasn't a mistake.  Wasn't a bat.
Covid was a lab leak
Video content: 90% conspiracy, 10% extrapolation and exaggeration
This video scream I am sponsored by Bill Gate
I watch these videos in bed with my cats
Yes. I don’t know exactly what will be the reason for the disappearance of mankind, but it looks like it will be soon. We are close to "great filter" anytime soon.
Bruh, whether or not covid came from bats or a lab (that designed coronaviruses) isnt up to "scientific debate".. its up to "China isnt letting anyone investigate and everyone who whistleblew got arrested which is super fkin suspicious!"
With nukes i can see how someone can think "OK i need to develop one to attack" but with a virus? after COVID19? I cant understand the mindset of any rational person saying "I have to develop the most killing and impossible to combat virus in human history" dont you know it will hunt you, your loved ones and your country eventually?  Anyway, i do fear that by accident it might happen. So sad to think about it
Exactly I think it’s destruction of resources
Sounds like something i know, resident Evil
As someone who regularly orders and has DNA synthesised for genetic engineering research, this is kind of misinformation. The companies that provide these synthesis services are actually pretty strict on who they will supply to and what they will make. They run your requested DNA sequence through multiple databases (especially the virus parts, iGem, NCBI, etc) and will not produce it if there are issues. I've had innocuous sequenced flagged because there was homology with toxin proteins, and had to liaise with their engineers/technicians.  There were other less than accurate claims here, but that one stood out as particularly egregious.
3:30 Yeah but in covid's defense, it wouldn't have spread at all if pompous, arrogant, self-serving idiots had heeded professionals AND STAYED WHERE THEY WERE... but noooooooo... everybody wanted to get home as soon as possible so they could infect everyone they loved.  A perfect example of how fast and easy a zombie outbreak could spread globally.  And then there's the people who refused to wear masks...
The genetics is so advanced that Humans need no more eyes
So your solution is to limit research like this to the billion-dollar corporations and the American government (the one with 5 thousand nukes). I can't wait to live in the world where only millionaires and government politicians have access to bio-engineering. Good thing you guys have millions of subs and lots of money huh. Go back to talking about the immune system I don't want any of your propaganda.
know-how of dangerous viruses are free, yet it's hard to find the know-how for a pipe bomb... oh the irony of it...
Chenoble blwe up  and it is a nuclear power plant
BRO I SWEAR I WAS ABOUT TO WATCH AND AN AD STARTED LIKE (ur probably watching a kurzgesagt video!) LIKE WTH
i agree and not, most professional edjucation is already very gatekeeped, by making young ppl get knowlage even harder isn't gonna solve any problem, hell it will hinder soo much more. and before anyone repplies just random bits on the internet is nothing.
Biggest threat are deep environmentalist terrorists.
Excellent video!! And super informative! thank you
Y'all really put in the work and I appreciate that
This whole "things get cheaper" is comedy gold
But where are the birds 🦢🦚🦜🐓
Where are the ducks?
The animation of UVC disinfection lamps with people in the room is wrong. Short-wavelength UV radiation is extremely harmful to humans and can cause severe burns and even cancer. Those lamps are only appropriate for disinfecting unoccupied rooms.
Presenting the covid vaccine like it worked perfectly... hmm.
so you are saying dying light  3 on the way
Sounds like a heads up from brotherman Bill lmao
idk man the 500,000,000 Megaton nuclear bomb in my basement is probably stronger than that
7:26 amogus
omg umbrella corporation at 3:49
Sorry kurzgesagt, but this time ya done goofed in more places than usual: you're trying to kick well-meaning biohackers out of the picture while forgetting that the real threats are from corrupt governments like China or north Korea, who give fuck all thought to all of the things mentioned. Scientific progress should be open, period. Also, sequencing DNA costs $1000, but it doesn't mean the average Joe can do it in their backyard for that price. You gotta have multi million dollar machines and lab equipment which, thanks to automation and improvements, can process many strands at once, so that's why it "only" costs a thousand dollars. That's true, but only if you shell out the millions required for the equipment (or offload to specialized labs like everyone else does). This video felt like liberal propaganda done bad, and it makes me real sad coming from you guys
Im so happy I had GEB103 (genetic engineering and biotechnology) course, I know how to do pcr and dna fingerprint someone.
I have learned so much from this video, and now I am going to try and find ways to develop a bio-nuclear weapon from my compost pit and my microwave oven. I will be waging war against my neighbor who keeps throwing his leaves to my side of the yard. Steve shall know my wrath.
It’s not the virus or bacteria I fear, it’s the people who are easy to panic and cause chaos. The corona virus would’ve been handled easier if people chilled the f out and let the institutions do its thing to fight it.
Ah yes, I'm sure the government will solve everything like the last pandemic.  Who exactly are you speaking for when you say "we" Kurzgesagt? You have a mouse in your pocket? This unabashed pro-government control propaganda should be beneath you.
In my lab, I have to wear protective eyewear and work fast when using a UV lamp so I don't get burns. I don't think employing a UV lamp in a hospital, especially a patient's room, is a good idea. Sure, it damages the nucleic acids in the virus, but what about the DNA and RNA in our skin and eyeballs? I wouldn't want to get skin cancer because I had visited my friend infected with a rhinovirus.
7:26
Even if you build a thing resembling iPhone it will never be "genuine iPhone" until apple says so, and they have legions of lawyers to sue you into oblivion if you even attempt this.
Say the same thing about guns now.
my sorry world but kurzgesagt just showed me how to build a nuclear bomb
The most scary thing about this video is the agenda behind the fear mongering,  who are " Open Philanthropy" what is the aim here. The false equivalence of the comparison between technologies is very misleading. I notice the imagery in the video is also look to be very subtle propaganda for lockdown treaties and looks very reminiscent of a certain oppressive regime actions and behaviours. Maybe I reading  too much into it, but I have notice that there  are endeavours to grab control or power by using fear mongering  like this.
Love the umbrella Corp reference
Where bird?
Technology makes amazing strides and becomes available for the common man. Your first thought is "We need to regulate it" Wtf Fearmongering at it's finest
Yup, more biotech fearmongering is exactly what we need
Yeah, and let's keep the building of vaccines to corporations. The ones that have cashed with the COVID 19 pandemic
I should order kill the whole world now! :)
I wouldnt even think about viruses if I wanted to cause harm. Stick to vaccines and create one against human organs or cells. Like a vaccine against Beta-cells in the pancreas to give somebody a vicious form of diabetes or against brain cells to cause deadly encephalitis. There was a reason some people were particulary against COVID vaccines, because of how they work and how one could potentially arm them against any potential sequence of bases in addition to the ones of the viruses, including some sequences which occure naturally in human bodies.
"Breathtaking"
Now I want to make nuclear bomb in my parent's garage
@7:20 "the really spicy stuff". Thanks, now I'm going to have a side of existential dread every time I reach for the hot sauce now
4:08 100% canon
"New Batshit virus discovered". That was a nice little easter egg.
I have a question why did you release a video where you didn't contact experts
You shouldn't have shown this to the world
wow
I hate that all you blind science followers don't actually look at the truth. I blindly follow and don't think
Isn't it weird that the guy that lost his Bill Gates sponsorship says we need to get vaccines faster than we've ever gotten them before
Ferb I know what we're going to do today
LOL @ Umbrella Corp :D Resident Evil incoming!
Ah yes, the classic "Oh look, a nonexistent problem(guy cooking up a bioweapon in his back yard, when making the likes of sarin is way easier)! Quick, approve big government (new laws and regulations) so it can be solved by infringing upon your natural rights(surveillance, tracking) even more!"  Nice try, but functional military-grade PPE can be had for 80-ish USD a mask and 20-40 ish a filter where I live. Let them cook.
did he say amogus
He just tried to make an argument for sing the only people that he thinks are worthy of controlling biohazard should be doing it. and yet he just articulated the argument that the people that think that they're cute and clever shouldn't be doing it. Oh no the future of our race is held in the hands of idiots
uh designing and synthesizing a virus from the ground up costs way more than a new car
Thanks a lot Kurzgesagt for making videos of like this. I really love that its compact with informations while enjoying watching awesome animations... and its FREE !
The reason why we have this problem is because we let people that think that their scientists be in control. Y'all aren't cute y'all aren't smart
donate some of those posters to orphans so they can be inspired to follow scientific careers
lol, good one, keep it up man
Make sure you keep it tight Kurt sagat know that you are a YouTuber you are not anybody that's going to school. and also recognized your blind spot that a lot of these people that have done to school by your own words don't know. You don't want to sound like one of those crazy ignorant channels
You could argue it propaganda is the most deadly
It's a cute and fun video but I think the channel that just lost their Bill Gates sponsor maybe doesn't fully know what science is. Lol
Seeing the Green iPhone 11 in the video on my Green iPhone 11 .... was such a mood uplifter for me
Who can really say that the current v1rus we have now is contained. In our country they just lessen the new about it. I'm guessing it will be the same for all countries, they just lessen the news.
This was literally the entire point behind Jurassic Park when it first came out. Now that show's just "LOOK AT DA BIG LIZURDS". Kind of a bummer it's strayed so far from it's scientific roots.
Kurzgesagt casually telling us what to do (and how much would it be) to make new virus :)
I usually really like Kurzgesagt videos, but I found this one deeply problematic. There’s an anthropocentrism here that’s both worrying and unjustifiable (“controlling” plants and animals around us etc.). There’s no reason why humans ought to be able to do this, besides our own ambitions and power. Further, there’s a naive kind of optimism here, as if our exponential ability to manipulate the world is matched by our moral sophistication as a species. I just don’t see the evidence of this in the world…
Among us 7:26
if you're afraid of that WHY fucking why give the idea to 20,7 millions of ppl ?
Ferb, I know what we are going to do today!
"What if you can build a nuclear bomb in your backyard?" NileRed: and I took that personally.
Well this solution attemps didn't mentiont that if you controle who will be able to have access, you could make an easy monopoly for biotech companys so if you want to have a working vaccine you have to ask THEM. And it's not only vaccines every aspect regarding biotech would be in the hands of companies. I think this should be mentioned.
I don't know, biology and ai are and will be much "easier" to develop/use than nuclear for example, are more like firearms but more dangerous.  You cannot control them like for uranium etc.  They are potentially within the reach of anyone with a minimum of knowledge in the field.  I'm really afraid that all this in the not too distant future could happen a disaster.
Just what i needed to keep me motivated on my bioengineering degree >:3
*Adeptus Mechanicus have entered the chat*
1:17 already explained how. It because it became available for the wider audiences across the globe due to it becoming more affordable by the day.
It was MADE in a lab. Do you really think they didn't have notes on what they made? And then there's this climate change nonsense smh
Eh, I'm not a fan of limiting knowledge, though I cede that this may call for it.  I'd rather explore limiting sophisticated lab equipment first.
Solve aging
I'll try it and see how easy it is to make deadly viruses, expect a tutorial soon!
This is mostly a great video about an important threat, but I was disappointed to see Kurzgesagt casually endorsing the lab leak theory as an aside—yes, we’re not 100% sure (and, thanks to a lack of transparency, we may never be), but the balance of probabilities is pretty clear that the virus was a natural spillover at the Huanan Seafood Market at this point. The script could easily have said ‘Though it’s unlikely that _this_ pandemic leaked from a lab, there have been lots of past incidents that mean this is a worrying ongoing possibility.’
So essentially you could kill millions if not billions with a few thousand bucks and an education in biochemistry.
"We don't know where Corona virus came from" - open your eyes... Yes we do 😂
Me and the homies when new kurzgesagt video drops
"We underestimated that you take everything that we put out into the world seriously" - really? You set these standards yourselves, by explaining at the end of all your videos (earlier ones) how you always contact scientists and check everything for your videos. It's natural people expect the same level of care for other social media posts.  On the video iteself, it looks like you embrace more and more technology as a way to tackle issues, both present and future, like climate change. That's extremely disappointing to me, because we simply don't have the time to wait for the supposed technological revolution that will get us out of our current mess. Scientists are extremely clear: we need to reduce emissions DRASTICALLY and NOW, not SLIGHTLY and LATER.  More and more, Kurzgesagt shifts away from a neutral point of view bringing factual knowledge, and goes more and more into an active tool to further push the economic interests of the rich and powerful, may that be intentionally or not. You'r taking a liberal stance. I'm disappointed by more and more videos you put out there because of this, and I think I will soon just stop watching. I'm genuinely sad about it. What a shame.
part of what makes technology so cheap now adays is that it was once classified military technology.  take wav and aiff pcm digital audio it was once sigsaly and sigaba.  now that the technology is obsolete and in fact worthless to the military it was declassified and now became aiff and wav pcm digital audio.  or covid came from a chinese (bio equivalent to a script kiddy)  because of the potential evil uses of biology i think safeguards should be taken for the responsible use and storage and handling of such bio samples
I love how the lab leak is now an "on going debate" while this time last year it was all conspiracy and almost illegal to talk about.
So when are the zombies coming?
Your videos never fail to amaze, brilliant work.
Please sir, make a video on " PLANET🌍 without HUMANS?? "
This is rising some moral questions, should knowledge be censored because it can harm ? (personnally i think that starting any censoring of knowledge would be the dumbest thing to do since we, as the humanity, have this awesome capability to share our knowledges)
You just want to monopolize information about viruses, nothing more. While the probability of ending humanity with a retarded irresponsible person is extremely small, the wars of arrogant billionaire racists are much more likely to end!
doctor bombastic💀💀💀
can you do "GRANDFATHER PARADOX" ??? :(
It might have helped that a certain Chinese lab had been studying the COVID virus for a long time using American funding.
I think you have to distinguish biological technology like vaccines from physical technology like nuclear fission, in that biological modifications have greater effects on any creature that comes in contact, not only the modified creature itself. May it be genetic modification to make corn more resistent, which in turn causes insects to adept and do even more harm to other creatures, or be it vaccines as a response to a pandemic, which may save lifes initially, but still has uncleared implications on the health of new borns for instance.  Considering that a lot of the problems that are tried to be solved using biological engeneering are also a result of human ignorance for the well being of each other and wild life, I discourage presenting biological engeneering as the solution. In the case of nature, I think humans are messing with complexities that exceed their comprehension.
All these inventions do nothing to change the sinful desires of man. War,.debt,.rape,.diseases, shootings, drug addiction, lies, theft, hate- All these are the reason we will never truly advance- that, and we are slowly but surely destroying our own host, the earth  Most will deny that, but in a decade or so, everyone will know things are truly getting bad.
The idea of the "virus observatory" I think is a really good one.
Been 20 years now since these concerns were raised. You’d think they could have fixed it by now. Ever since the anthrax scare the secret service have been worried about a custom bio-weapon using crisper especially, now renamed RNA tech.
Thank you Kurzgesagt, that "that hurt, we wanted to be better than that" was touching. This mindset is why i friggin love you and all your work!
Doofenshmirtz is finally gonna be able to take over the tri-state area with this
blue tanjiro looks so cold 😎
We can actually do a lot!  Politicians: We don't do that here.
The UV-C lamps at the ceiling killed me... Literally.
3:19 dream of an Ancap
no ones talking about DR BOMBASTIC bomb tutorial? 6:42
Rabies is still a thing
I appreciate that kurzgesagt considers the lab leak as a possibility still, and isn't ignorantly saying it came from a raccoon dog.
😂
I am personally a big believer that biotech is the future, instead of the more "traditional" sci-fi physics. We might not be reaching the stars at light speed anytime soon, but food & medicine production, gene editing, and gene therapy are already well in use, and only getting better by the day. I'd wager that cures for most common ailments including (symptoms of) aging will come before something like general AI.
Thank you!
Legend has it, we need to test this out on us humans. 🔥
Let's order a deadly dna to experiment at home!
wow, this is the first time I hard disagree with the execution of the video
I was saving to buy a car. Now, I have other plans for that money.
If Kurzgesagt makes a video about it, it probably is part of military arsenals already.
6:24 oh my gosh is that 777 from unstoppable? Honestly a great reference.
Like the vaccine for Covid ever worked... WOW this was an amazing video!
The vial rolling at 4:33 is so stressing 😅
yes That is Wuhan Virus
Kursgazart: explaining sciencey things.  Kursgazart: could you make a nuclear bomb in your backyard?
Yay Open Philanthropy! They have our best interest at heart so I trust them! 🤖
Secure. Contain. Destroy.
I would like a video about neuroscience 🙂
That Covid Vaccine Take was pure BS,  everyone knows that vaccine came out way too rushed and without the proper safety, were going to start seeing the emergence of the vaccines secondary effects soon no matter how much they try to censor it. Thats right BEWARE bioweapons
I swear, the entire point of this video is fear mongering to help push government regulation. First time I actually disliked a Kurzgesagt video
Progression of the Lab Leak Hypothesis: Stage 1: Declared a racist conspiracy theory. Stage 2: Widespread Censorship. Stage 3: People in power start to like it. Stage 4: Government announces it's reasonable Stage 5: Widespread acceptance (Even by those who formerly called it unhinged based on nothing). Stage 6: Appears in a Kurzgesagt video telling you to be afraid yet again.  Congratulations people.
IM TYPE ONE DIABETIC AND I USE INSULIN (i noticed the caps and cba to change it soooooo)
Please avoid these kind of content Kurzgesagt, we all love you and want the channel and the team to get to the top and get the attention they very well deserve, but this video might very well be stupid and harmfully oversimplified
your videos are much more then education they are masterpieces! every video brings a tear to my eye. like a roller coaster of emotions and usually ends up on a positive note that gives me hope for our future
I'd never trust anyone to decide for me who "the right people" are.
Always a great video!  No intro, but thank you for keeping the outro.
Gates funded fear porn.
I swear, most of kurzgesagt's videos are like made to be scary with thumbnails and the info in the video, but in the end it all deescalates with "but you don't need to worry"
yeahhh we dont know it was a lab leak  yeaaaa 😄🙄
Imagine this video sponsored by online virus DNA seller.. 😂
12 monkeys scenario...
As a biologist uni student, success rates are very low and successful DNA synthesis and gene insertion is only successful 3% of the time.
That's the first time i have seen kurzgesagt without the intro
3:50 the resident evil reference
The most dangerous weapon in propaganda. And this channel is baking propaganda for billionaires and German state.
Not sure where the covid virus came from? Kurzge...Propaganda as always...
3:15 I know what I must do
I see you Kurzgesagt @3:48 with the Umbrella corporation reference from Resident Evil. 😜
let that sink in "unthinkable a decade ago" then imagine what would we achieve by 2033.
80,000 hours? The company that was close to Sam Bankman-Freid and his scam - all whilst the top people knew? No thank you!
There's no debate...corona virus = China virus
<3
7:26
How much do the wealthy pay you for propaganda? I want to get into the business.
This is the most disappointing video from you guys. No, there's no debate about the source of covid. Don't fuel the conspiracy theories and stop spreading watered down biology. I am at loss for words how this stupid take is presented in a matter of fact delivery. Creating a virus is not that easy. And where do you come up with this numbers, and time it requires? Just pulled it out of thin air, or took a randon number from a paper and oversimplified it I bet?   What a disappointment. I couldn't even get to half the video.
Biotechnology bears breathtaking potential - love how  encouraging you are 😂
Of all the videos you've made I think that this one was the worst. Somehow it felt just like fearmongering.
I like these guys but we know where the last pandemic came from, we know why it was so fast to produce "vaccines", we know what modified crops do to our body... stay up
With quantum and supercomputers, its not too crazy to think that a perfect virus would be evolved digitally
This was a strange video honestly.
So sad no one will build iPhone at home due to the lack of Right to Repair
Scientists employed in a restricted Chinese government lab created Covid. And the German answer to this is that governments should restrict public access to that research even more. Typical. They can create any shit they want and we're not allowed to know about it until it's too late. Thanks.
On the topic of bioweapons and how dangerous they can be for the whole world  A Chinese whistleblower woman who worked in labs in China came out on Fox News saying that covid19 is a bioweapon that was accidentally leaked   I do firmly believe that covid19 is a bioweapon
When are you going to have a European distribution hub for your merch?
You don't solve problems by withholding information... you solve problems by sharing information.
Every machine is a smoke machine if you operate it wrong enough.
Corona virus is a successful scam
Where is the opening theme :(
Weird that this youtube channel and the wuhan lab are both financed by bill gates. Open your eyes people. Propaganda is everywhere
so when can i expect an apocalypse? cmon stop teasing me already.
I'm not wishing bad to the humanity, but overpopulation is still a bad thing, too..
Great even more tracking...
7:26
“Unknown coronavirus “ what the one that was made in a lab in Wuhan?
6:40 Many people already do this. Hell, multiple teachers I've had have done this, so I don't know what you're talking about with this point. 💀 This is the worst video I've seen from y'all tbh and has made me less trusting of you and Open Philanthropy.  The biggest issue here is that it literally won't be possible to keep scientific information from the public indefinitely, any embargo period is a bandaid solution, and frankly I trust governments with exclusive access to this kind of information... maybe not less than I do the general public, but definitely not more either. Especially as someone who lives in a prohibitionist country that constantly tries to strip away people's bodily autonomy and which commits violence against it's citizens and especially the citizens of other countries every single day.  It's very telling that you very quickly blaze through the benefits of open science and only detail the more minor benefits, and instead skip to the worst imaginable outcomes immediately like "But someone could make the next pandemic!" despite the fact that, as many commenters are already saying, making a biological WMD in a home lab is much harder than you make it out to be, and despite the fact that citizen science in biotechnology has done unimaginable good for society. It's also very telling that, instead of emphasizing more governmental transparency to ensure governments don't intentionally or accidentally release biohazards (which would make more sense since they're far more able to than any average civilians are) you instead focus on fearmongering about the general populace.  I really do have to wonder what the limit of prohibition would end up being here. First, pathogenic viral information is "too dangerous" to share in a free and open source way, (which also sounds like a convenient reasoning to paywall science even harder so monopolies can make more money by crippling researchers financially, which always hinders science) then research on drug-synthesizing bacteria and fungi becomes illegal to share publicly, and then broader bans on citizen science (at least when it comes to biotechnology) are introduced? Alarmist and overly-broad calls to prohibition like this rarely result in a net positive, and how quick you are to minimize the extensive benefits of citizen science in your rush to ban free and open source sharing in biotechnology research is surprising and extremely disappointing.
The most dangerous things in the United States is democrats 😂
You enlightened me about the things which I don't know that I don't know. Great work as always!
Can't wait for irl übercharge. 🎉🎉🎉
This is a weird one for me, I feel like the risk of biohackers creating biological weapons is insanely overblown in this video.  Other commenters have pointed out that obtaining certain genetic material is regulated and tracked, but even if it wasn't, it still requires an astronomical level of knowledge, skill, and equipment to apply any of that "free" biotech knowledge towards anything serious.  I honestly believe it would be far easier for someone to build a nuclear weapon. Both in the obtsining of material and the knowledge and skill required.   Put enough firealarms in a beryllium box and you have a nuclear device.  Mix a bunch of genetic material together with the wrong tools and all you have is a bunch of bacteria and a collosal waste of money.
Spoilers alert:  We are all doomed.
Came for some real talk about biotechnology hazards, stayed for the show of intellectual humility (the poster redesign). Looking forward to adding that to my next order!
What happened to the people's faces? Also can we have the pokémon references again?
The most dangerous weapon is not an artificial virus,its the ability to easily make an artificial virus
Kurzgesagt would have you think the virus lab, which studied and made virus wasn't to blame, but the wet market across the street from it was. Even though 2 separate government agencies said it was made in a lab.
Advocating for the restriction of free knowledge are we kurz? Yes I can definitely tell you're funded by The Gates Foundation.
Inbreeding is out of control in the south

Stars trek and sneeze
Wow that new 3d panning and Dr. Bombastic is hilarious.
Kurzgesagt went all Capitalist mode. so basically you suggest to ban knowledge and let the rich own it so they can use it for "GOOD"? Like they ever did anything good for the people and the life or even the planet. limiting access to knowledge just for bloodsucker billionaires so they can control everything more easily and effectively? wow what a new brilliant idea you guys had in Kurzgesagt. let's tell IMF and world bank about it. you doing PR for Colonial imperialists?
How to make billions 1) Work at a lab creating bioweapons 2) get a sample of the bioweapon, paint it into your fingernails 3) go to russia and sell the biotech from ur nails
9:10 You can add this video to that cringe compilation. You really tried to gas light us and say "we still don't know where the COVID 19 virus came from". Yet it's been proven to have come out of China from a lab leak. Pretty sad that y'all are doing this. Y'all must be getting payed the big bucks from bill gates and the Chinese government to act stupid.
bio technology is still too slow
I just got a ad from Data Time they knew I was watching kazs vid
Wish they talked about furries becoming a thing
I stopped watching at 1:19 because almost everything that was said to that point was either inaccurate, wildly inaccurate, or flat out false. Please do better.
3:33 We know it came from a lab leak in Wuhan. Stop pretending it's up for debate or that no one knows. Pretty sad coming from y'all. Then again, you are funded by bill gates.
This chanel always give me Goosebumps I love it. keep up the good job guys👌😁
these weapons come from labs just like covid. praise putin for destroying these labs in ukraine
There is some hidden agenda in this video.
Sneaky using umbrella corp’s logo 😅
Probably your most disappointing and least researched video to date. Please do everyone a favor and delete it.

So what do we do about insane republicans who will reject all these things automatically for reasons which are not clear?
Oh turns out this is just pure corporate propaganda with major inaccuracies, i know you guys already agree with corporate interests but what the absolute fuck
Eh the whole concept of "We should track people and limit peoples ability to access information cause bad things could happen" Is a dicey topic, and has issues that clash with fundamental freedom of speech rights in many western countries. If anything that will be the stumbling block that will inhibit any controls who does what with biological technology.  Also I take issue with the opinion that we've been "responsible" and have limited nuclear proliferation through limiting access to information when its the fact that getting a hold of the materials to make a weapon that has more been the issue. The information to make a bomb is easily obtained, its the materials and production of those materials that's extremely difficult to get a hold of or make without killing yourself, or tipping off other countries onto what you're doing. To that point look up the case of boy scout who built a functional nuclear reactor in his shed.   You could conceivably control it through a licensing program, but that too has its limits, and relies on countries caring enough to license people to perform genetic work, and or the ability to control the manufacture of equipment needed to do such work. That also falls apart if the equipment is also easy to make on your own.   This also somewhat mirrors efforts of gun control, as the information, equipment needed, and materials to make your own firearm is freely available and difficult to stop.
where are the ducks? now my daughter doesnt want to see it anymore :(
This video feels like an (authoritarian) anti open research/ source rally... It paints the absolutely misleading picture of anyone being able to (accidentally!?) bioengineering a deadly, no cure virus (at home in their free time). Which simply isn't the case, government military programs and their wars pose by far the greater threat and limiting information to the public would only add to the advantage they have...  Information is power and we need to spread it as much as we can, to collectively benefit (and even be able to act against dangerous things)!
I'm sure the Cov-19 vaxx being sent to market at warpspeed was helped along by the fact the virus was made by the people behind the shot.
eeey at least you've started putting your propagandist backers in front of the video, now I at least know this is corporate propaganda, and what variety it is so I can watch with an appropriate headframe: extremely suspiciously as many people are already spotting major inaccuracies, I really wish you guys would stick to space stuff and ants.
thanks kurzgesagt for making me genius and smart❤️
It's not directly Bill Gates money but it may as well be...
It's one piece
Whos that pokemon card! Its caterpie! Lol
Fantastic video as always. I especially loved the Jurassic Park cameo.
All of the guitars and guitarists in this video are left-handed! My people!
Wow this video is extremely low quality with so much crappy false information. 1. Yes we pretty much know where covid-19 came from and it was not some super secret lab from a James Bond movie. 2. Cochlear implants do not attach to or interact with the brain directly, they attach to a bone. 3. UV lamps for sterilizing air in living spaces are absolutely stupid idea, since the are either too low power to actually kill anything, or produce ozone that slowly kills you. 4. Filtration of air in such vast quantities to prevent damage from a bio attack is just unfeasible even in the wildest dreams. 5. The reason why DNA sequencing is so cheap is due to the economies of scale, same as where a modern CPU can be bought for $100, but you can't build your own CPU in your garage.
As long as we don't have to empower organizations like the WHO or UN  or in any way give them control over our lives and liberty
That test tube slowly rolling toward the edge of the table at 4:33 gave me so much anxiety
scare people first so that you can better restrict them afterwards, classic
Is it just me or is that the Umbrella Corporation logo on the top of that skyscraper that we keep seeing clips of? (From Resident Evil) I mean somebody has to know this lol... I really hope it's a purposeful reference, but at the same time lol anyone who's watched the show knows what happens when you play with viruses.
I was watching a BBC interview from the 60's yesterday with the top scientists and engineers of its time. They were asked what they think the year 2000 will look like in terms of technological advancement. They got really excited about the prospects. And they were right about handheld devices and not having to do paper filing. What they were wrong about is that we will be having 6 months holidays every year and a 2-day work week. We can't possibly predict what exactly will happen, so I err on the side of caution and reign my optimism in and presume that humans will find a way to use this advancement to exploit others, as usual....
virus.exe... You guys are great. Keep up the excellent work!
Friend pandmic is real but i dont think viruses can be used as nuclear bomb.
Ban gain of function ffs. Also why don't ask questions exactly how the so called vaccine came about so quickly
I think I found what I’m gonna do this summer
7:26
the most Dang weapon is not nuclear, its bio-neclear
those donations from the gates foundation are sure going a long way.
This video effectively seems to be spreading a message that is: "You should be afraid, and information ought to be restricted." This video destroys the credibility of both Kurzgesagt and the credibility of Open Philanthropy. I now think that both of these organizations are likely corrupt and evil. As a rule, spreading fear and restricting information, is never good.
Kind of sounds like fear mongering so that Bill Gates can justify creating IP enclosures so that we don't have to give vaccines to India and South Africa.   Bill Gates is definitely a financial  supporter of these guys too.
This , this is what will wipe us out
All I get from these videos are I need acreage in a low population area lmao
I didn't know you could order samples of viruses  Inb4 someonr brings smolpox back to life
Is it just me, or did the quality of kuzgesagt fell? There were a lot of outright untrue infos.
3:51 umbrella cooporation LOL
the most dngerous weapon is sponsored misinformation - companies like gates and melinda foundation are not good for society
when i clicked this video an ad just pop up and saying to me, “hey are you watching kurzgesagt video?” me: HOW DID YOU KNOW?
All this sketchy "Gain of Function" research should be legally required to be done on ships (potentially located far away from ports) and have quarantine boats to transport lab workers back and forth.  No matter how inconvenient or expensive this may be, it's the ounce of prevention worth the billions of dollars worth of cure we just went through.
"Nuclear energy was born from weapons programs" is false, such a German statement... jeez...
So the wirus escaped from labs..? That's something new! 😷
Every time I see a new video notification I stop what I'm doing and take a small break to enjoy your fantastic videos.  Thank you for all your hard work.
Paid promotion and funded by philanthropy? All of a sudden I’m not sure if I can trust you any more.  A sad day.
A video about CRISPR without saying CRISPR.
I thing there is something missing, something familiar
"The unknown coronavirus"  Unsubsribe😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 what a JOKE
Ah Yes Biological Weapons.... Nope. Nope. Don't need mutations happening. Don't need umbrella happening.
I think the biggest hurdle for humanity with this subject is getting the majority of people to take it and their health and the people around them's health seriously. Because of the distrust in government, the conspiracies, and misinformation of COVID, so many people died because they simply refused to follow the covid guidelines for themselves and those around them. Not to mention governments being up and down, confusing, and constantly saying "okay you can unmask now" then the next week saying, "nevermind put it back on". People don't follow that roller coaster easily. So you have to stay consistent. But because the government cared more about capitalism than public health, they didn't care about consistency.

Going towards a restrictive approach to sharing knowledge is an unethical and ineffective way to prevent a disaster. Look at the nuclear arms race. We still have nations with nuclear bombs. Some regimes are good, others are bad. But the thing is the nuclear threat hasn't been eradicated by keeping info top secret. Rather, superpowers have accumulated a vast number of bombs, and they are the ones trying to restrict other nations from getting it. Power has been centralised, and if it were not for diplomacy, then we would have been perished by now. If you restrict open knowledge sharing in biotech, the same thing will happen in the future. The best way to prevent a bio threat would be regulations on who can get the materials and equipment to engineer a virus. That's it. Stopping open databases on sequenced genomes is a step in the wrong direction. It is unethical and honestly, just a way to preserve the political status quo, i.e, keeping the US, EU and Russia in power. You gave a bad message in this video, Kurszgesagt. There is 4.4k dislikes on 100k likes, You can figure out why so many dislikes are there this time.
Hmm. .  . The first thing I thought after this video is LEGALIZE NUCLEAR BOMBS!!

5:06 hey look joy cons
The iPhone analogy is deeply flawed (and it's a pity your Apple brandism caused you to miss an amazing parallel).  A phone isn't simply parts - it's also an OS and Apple guards both parts tightly making "from scratch" clones as you suggest extremely difficult without having an actual iPhone from which to harvest key parts. Even then the security in their system, which extends down to locking each core part to each other making replacing even one core part (not to mention repair) almost impossible, would make this even harder still. Exactly the OPPOSITE of your 'share and make easy' proposal.  On the other hand, there's a legal, open-source version of Android (AOSP - Android Open Source Project) based on the same code that runs in retail Android phones with a few missing but not essential parts. Android phones are based on retail and easily obtained parts. In theory at least, anyone can make an Android phone from scratch because core knowledge and code is shared by everyone. Just like your proposed mechanism for biodata.  I know creatives LOVE to shove Apple references in wherever they can, but this is one of those times where that urge literally undermined your message.
I know how bio weapons are getting rid of. first they are put in nuclear waste. It destroys the bio weapon and after that they put the nuclear waste in a incinerator it destroys the bio weapon completely.
Ah yes, Scarlet Rot IRL.
- The rapid progress of biotechnology has given us the tools to manipulate living organisms, resulting in advances in healthcare and agriculture. However, this same progress has made it easier for individuals with malicious intent to create weaponized viruses. - The sharing of information in the field of biotechnology, including the genetic data of dangerous viruses, makes it possible for well-meaning scientists to inadvertently or irresponsibly share blueprints for creating highly destructive viruses. - The accessibility of synthetic DNA and equipment needed to rebuild viruses, as well as the lack of comprehensive tracking, raises concerns about the ease with which anyone could create a weaponized virus. - The consequences of a weaponized virus being unleashed could be devastating, potentially causing pandemics that would lead to the loss of millions or even hundreds of millions of lives.

Can we appreciate how they tried their best to make this amazing video for us
I just want to alter my dna to be like spider-man 😂
Lol at "New Batshit Virus Discovered".
7:26 no way
It's biological (a virus - or one modified to target a genetic marker)
It's over
Whatever the case maybe, putting restrictions on the tech will only encourage actual bad actors to go underground with their research and create a false sense of security amongst the ignorant masses. Instead publishing publicly and keep the people informed will yield a better understanding and countermeasures in the long run.
Please work on a new video based on latest Aritifcial Intelligence too!! I am a big fan of you guys Keep creating videos like these!!
What was I on when I made this comment ???
3:48  That sign on the building looks like the umbrella corporation symbol from resident evil.  Is it just me?
Yes, regulate the access to developmental and scientific tools so that only elitist big pharma can handle it! That´s the best idea ever!  ./s
Весело. Теперь продвигают цензуру любой информации по днк. Монополия на информацию страшнее любых вирусов.
Newer kurtzgezat content is feeling samey and just feel like they are spouting buzzwords and bogus ideas in the span of minutes without going into detail about anything in particular.  Im not really sure whats happened over the past couple of years but its probably a part of the studio getting larger and larger, oh well
Thanks for the email telling me this was available❤❤❤
Biotechnology can be breathtaking.
aka resident evil
As an American, I take offense to the concept of "infohazard"  That shi7 is about two steps from being "1984."
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and ssvior
It's highly confusing to me that you would suggest that "COVID may have come from a lab, we don't know" when we know it didn't. Every microbiologist that has spoken about the possibility have flat out denied it as a possibility. There are none of the genetic markers that would suggest bio engendered viruses. And we have come along way in 10 years, but not that far, we don't have the technology to make viruses hop species yet.
Calling the upsides of an NPP "huge" seems really exaggerated to me. After shutting down the last nuclear power plants in germany we already built enough solar and wind power to cover what we lost. In like 4 months, instead of the several years it takes to build an NPP. Without any risks and less centralisation. All the while renewable enegy requies FAR less in the way of tax subsidies to actually work.
Yes ‼️ Do not share information ‼️ I love capitalism ‼️‼️
STOP GAIN OF FUNCTION RESEARCH
talking about covid in past tense as if it's not still disabling and killing people all over the place wtf
Can we all take a moment to appreciate that the Umbrella Corporation released a deadly bio-virus like it hasn't done that about 7 or so times
I personally think that , being scared about something, has a greater effect than the thing it self,  one of my teachers relatives got COVID-19, and it was at the beginning of the pandemic , he went to the hospital to give a test , and just as he heard the test results that , he tested positive for COVID-19 ، he unfortunately had a heart attack and died .
Transcend biology.
Wow super interesting but creepy at the same time
Mad scientist tries to create a deadly bioweapon.   Accidentally creates a virus that turns everyone into supermodels  "Meh... Close enough."
Lol so kurzgesagt try to not cringe challenge do exist?
this video really proves that kurzgesagt is a capitalist shill. the research is also funded by bill gates. Open Philanthropy lol  you know what it would mean when research gets regulated? it's not that bad people would be unable to weaponize it. it would be corporations being able to monopolize these research.
367 technoblade never dies
Even if this was accurate, why would you post it and make more people (who could use this stuff for ill) aware that they are able to? This seems like it's a signpost video directing people towards a biotech version of the Anarchist's Cookbook
where's the intro song
As someone who majored in biotech engineering back in the day, I can say this video was a real disappointment. It exaggerated all of the risks to suggest that it'd be better to overregulate. A real shame and cuts into how much I can trust the rest of their content where I am not as knowledgable.
CCP propaganda
No new info on my part, i'm a simple chemical engineer with not much knowledge in biology. It is refreshing to hear a positive vibe dispite the bleak outlook underlying this subjuct you bring.
I don't believe the answer stated in this video is optimal as it leads to a orwellian kind of world of mass surveillance as a tradeoff for security. You all know how this would end.
One of the most unhelpful and misinformed videos. I thought it was just fluff the way you oversimplified how easy gene-tech is, but to continue to spread misinformation about covid was enough to report this video.
The UV illustration is a bit misleading. High Powered UV lamps like those are exclusively used in sensitive bio laboratories for a reason. Sure, they're powerful enough to kill any microorganisms inhabiting the air but also powerful enough to degrade the other compounds in the air into more dangerous materials. Not to mention the cancer you'll get from the UV exposure damaging your cells. You'll get away with it if you're using it for some sort of decontamination procedure before going into a sterile workplace but for general use, it is really not advised.
As a German the most dangerous thing is unemployment.
First you scare People, then you can introduce your top down control amid their eager cries. And by the time you or the People realize this was a mistake the wrong people are destroying society with absolute power and the best of intentions.
3:50 Whys there Umbrella
WHAT!? We KNOW it was natural!
ill be off to make the flood
Hey Ferb I think I know what we're gunna do today!
Your videos used to kind of scare me in the past, with some of the topics being a bit heavy and such. But this video made me more hopeful and excited for what’s to come in the field of medical science.  Wish I wasn’t so squeamish or I’d love to do a little science myself lol…I get scared looking at things under a microscope!
What most of you missed is a discovery that was developed in 2018 and spread almost like a virus to tremendous scales, it was mentioned at 7:26
Info-hazzards aren't some 1984 new world order conspiracy you fucks, you want to make the blueprint of a nuclar bomb public information?
uh oh...
If you wanted to hurt / kill a lot of people, why would you go through the trouble of manufacturing a virus or biological weapon when you can just infect a drug supply?  Generic drug manufacturing facilities are all in other countries.  The FDA can visit to inspect international pharma operations, but lacks the resources to provide effective oversight.  These inspections are also inherently difficult to conduct randomly because the US must alert the national government where the manufacturing facility is located.
new Kurzgesagt word just dropped - "Crappy"
Gain of function is scary and needs insane amounts of regulation or we’re done
Gee, imagine what progress we could make if the public still trusted medical and scientific authority figures. Alas, those power hungry big shots destroyed their own credibility by doing EVERYTHING wrong in their response to COVID.   Idiots.
The human brain is evolving right now. Things that seem simple, become complicated. And things that seem complicated become simple. The organ that does the processing of these problems is literally changing. The way that the human brain interprets information and deals with it will soon be very different. Becoming less like a primitive animal, and more of a data processor. Maybe this will be too much for the brain and digital brains take over that part of life. I dont know that for sure. But i think soon the brain will branch into a new lineage, but this technology may happen before we are ready. Like a monkey with a gun.
Oh we are so fucked, lol. It's already way too late.
COVID was created in a lab in China. This video is proof of that it isn’t hard to create a virus.
I have the flu & the shits so when I eat something to stay nourished it just goes right through me what u recommend I eat thatll stay in me long enough for me to absorb the nutrients? (Smart ppl only pls)
A channel funded by Bill Gates who has a stake in many biotech companies, trying to make a video to inhibit the propagation of knowledge that creates competition
Nice propaganda
.... I'm pretty sure that covid jab was *NOT* a vaccine
If we could build a nuclear bomb in our backyard, we would choose not to. Or at least i would choose not to. If anyone reads this and you think differently then you might be part of the problem
So you said we should destroy a virus as soon as possible by advancing the tech as much as we can. I mean, didn't you just mention that the problems are coming exactly from the technologies we've developed: like the computers and internet which make the propagation of the knowledge more freely, and the biotech equipment makes the produce of the virus more easier? If I'm getting this right these so called knowledge and tools are the ultimate trouble maker.
Let’s appreciate the animations in this video! It seems a lot better than the previous videos! It’s truly beautiful!
Sooo.... you want to cencor knowladge ? Sounds like what happed to drugs intead of teaching people to handle it care fully and creating cure you just band things that people think is scary i did not like this video
a good way of putting it is - this technology is inherently neither good or bad, it's up to us(humans), to determine how we'll experience it.
Regulation of information has never brought any good.!
Literally fear mongering for profit...

even a dirty bomb can be somehow contained, but biowarfare is the one thing that can eradicate the whole humanity with a single strike

honestly speaking, covid really helped me prepare for my college entrance exams and gave me, an introvert, an excuse to stay at home.
they already made the covid vax before they released it.

Waiting for Wranglerstar to post a video on how to bioengineer a doomsday virus.    “Act accordingly.”
Thank you so mush for this video, it is teaching me things that I couldn’t even have imagined!
You're just scare mongering, to take away access to knowledge & equipment, so only your rich donors can create pandemics as the profit motive dictates.
they create the disease so they can sell us the cure
This is a very pessimistic and alarmist point of view on microbiology. I am quite sure rather than trying to invent a new superbug(which the tools and expertise required cost hundreds thousands of dollars, not just a thousand dollars) people are more likely to improve on their own DNA and make sickness or even aging obselete. As most people want to survive/live as long as they can.  And destruction are Government/military business, a super genius at home would never be able to outspend or outsmart the military/government in creating a super bio weapon.
The most nightmare inducing advancement for me in biotech is the development of necrobiotics. Using the dead bodies of spiders as claws for robots.
If there’s a giant virus on earth and your in space you would probably need to land on a diffrent planet because food supplies and water supply so I would suggest landing on Mars and creating your own colony without any problems just a fresh new start.
A relatively big problem would also be dealing with antivaxxers

they should not trust me with deadly viruses fr
Immediate unsubscribe for even entertaining the concept of "infohazards". I am extremely shocked and disappointed by the authoritarian attitude of this video, centralized control is much more dangerous than free and open access to information.
Need flash, It probably was man made.
As someone currently writing a sci-fi book with the themes of quantum mechanic and bio-engineering, I really enjoyed this video... also I should publish sooner with how fast science has been moving lately.
the pug looks scary…

Kurzgestat:It's getting so easy to make deadly viruses that you could just make them in your backyard with a modest sum  Hey, Ferb! I know what we're going to do today!
Another "Woke Science" video. Unsubscribed after seeing this. Next video they'll put out will be about how equality matters over merit in the field of science.
Un poco conspiranoico el video... Considerando además el tipo de contenido que suelen publicar, el rigor cientifico que debe tener, y el hecho de que se supone que confiemos en que lo que dice es cierto en un (casi) 100%. Es extraño 😬
3:31 well the fact that the virus broke out in one of the few Chinese towns that possesses a grade 4 laboratory and the fact that China did not allow the WHO to start investigating (well after a year they did, probably when all the evidence was gone) point to a breakout from a laboratory.  Let’s just hope that China wasn’t working on a biological weapon
*Reads title* Do I really need to worry about another damn thing? *clicks on it*
Something is very wrong and different about this video. The people are faceless and generic. There are no birds. The video isn't broken into their usual kind of chapters, nor does it have an intro. They didn't promote this video on reddit like they usually do. Heck, even their sources document is cited incorrectly. Their bibliography cites a source about UVC lamps, but links to an article that doesn't have any mention of the claim. The biggest thing to me is that this video relies very heavily on a single source, and the author of that source received millions of dollars in funding from the sponsor of this video. That doesn't feel right to me, either. Kurzgesagt says in their finance video that they have contracts that prevent their grant givers from editorial influence other than suggesting topic areas. Their reliance on a paper published by someone who received money from the same institution makes doubt that claim.  Something is just very wrong about all this. I can't say I'm happy with this video, it feels overly alarmist and downplays the benefits of the free sharing of information and scientific research. If I can't even trust some of the facts in this video, I'm not gonna trust the opinions, either. And I say this as a long-time fan, too.   I really love what kurzgesagt brings the world. I just want some kind of explanation for why this all happened. How'd they get their sources cited wrong? How did they not see the conflict of interest in their main source? Why is the animation style and format so different?   By all means, I'd love to be wrong. If I missed something I'd love to know. But at first glance, it really seems like something's up with this video.  Edit: It actually is broken into chapters, it's just more subtle about it.
More calls for centralization from this channel. What's new?
Was this video sponsored by Phizer, China, and/or the World Economic Forum? Holy cow, leave the propoganda out of your next video. Thumbs down on this one
I love EVERYTHING you do! Pls make vids on pure math too. Its a subject that transcends cultures and underlies all our sciences. Yet its ruthlessly despised and loathed bcuz of the way its taught in schools. Only you guys can reveal the hidden beauty of something like that. Pls give it a thot. Inspiration from sources like this, is what raises up great scientists and teachers for the future. Love ur work, never stop ❤
3:35 It was 100% created by China. You even mentioned how fast the sequence was figured out. Are you forgetting the fact that as soon as the pandemic started, China released the sequence? They already knew it, because they created it.
it's like the knife analogy except every year we keep making even more useful and simultaneously even deadlier knives

3:15  uuuuhhhh...2nd amendment, ever heard of it?
A senior biotech student and I’m so hyped watching this hahahahaha. Will destroy the world as soon as I can.
Oh boy, you better hope the soviet union doesnt see this soon!
The problem, as an example in Germany we only have a few 100 students each year in this field.  I'm studying bioinformatics and bio system technology with only 8 other students at my university.
You know the topic is serious, when they use the human models instead of birds... 😨
Bro I’m about to start wearing a mask everywhere
China leaked information that covid came from a lab
I love this channel but the quote" no researcher would think to share data on laborty equipment into bomb making machine's" is obviously not true! It's being done every day by government and home made local terrorists.  Government can't not even regulate local politics without MAJOR corruption. You think they care about this!?!?!?!? Nooooo just the next bribe and pay check
Ferb, i think i know what we’re going to do today!
Biotech-nooooooooooo!-logy

4:45 It reads at the bottom of the book New BatShit Virus Discovered 😂😂
It will never be used for good in this current clown world, maybe in 1000 years from now.
*We will watch your career with great interest.*
False. We know it was from the lab in Wuhan chins.  This is fact and it was in part funded by Dr fauci
I love the amount of fake news this one loves sharing. We had vaccines ready for COVID-19 literally days after the pandemic officially started.
7:26 AMONGUS?!??
The very act of posting this video disseminates this idea. We have now increased the chances of something happening. 😬
This video sucks. Kurzgesagt’s opinion is wrong. It only calls for less science and more regulatory bodies and stupid laws in an already excessively controlled and policed environment. It is full of simplifications, misconceptions and hype. To be honest it disgusts me. Poor research, poor understanding and most importantly, poor thinking. I didn’t expect something like that from Kurzgesagt.
I wholeheartedly disagree with the videos point of tracking people for knowing about deadly virus RNA strands.
it boggles the mind how some of the people who have seen how rapidly telecommunications technology has evolved in recent years are also able to reject RNA vaccines like the Covid vaccines which were considered to be created "too quickly".
If nature doesn't create a potential extinction threat, humans will take care of that. Time to invest in Big Pharma. Nice video as always.
"亀戸異臭事件" In Japan, on June 27, 1993, Aum Shinrikyo cultured anthrax and spread it in residential areas. Fortunately, it did not develop into a major accident because of their lack of biology knowledge. It is fortunate that there will be no Aum Shinrikyo in 2023.
Not a good idea to watch this before going to sleep. Bruh.
Literally the plot of The Division
This reminds me of lab banana
TL:DR The plot of The Division, but real and worse.
4:32 That viral vial slowly rolling towards the edge of the desk gave me all sorts of anxiety.  Well-played!  Captain Trips might be just one tiny lab accident away from becoming reality.
The reason I took biology in high school
Anyone who got a ad something about data time saying that we watching kurzgesagt video
who decides who the "wrong people" are?
you can blame Bill Gates and WHO for covid19
2:38 Chinese children: 0_0
Thanks to kurzgesagt, I can make more efficient weapons.
🤔 why animal to human transfer disease treatment so hard like hiv , diabetes & corona types 🤔 and some of those till not get treatment find out, why 🤔🤨
15 years from now, we’re gonna start seeing coronavirus compensation ads
This video takes the extremes of both the good and bad.  The bad: a high schooler with $40k can build a bio weapon in 10 years or someone with a bio degree can do it in 1.   The good: no one would post the dna sequence online so people can use it for evil.   Not sure about this video. Seems like it was lacking any actual investigation and putting too much faith in bad people. Kinda reminds me of the no gun signs
not a comment about their over lords profit from the harmful vaccine????  i really cant watch anymore of this channel
The point is it has become far cheaper easier and deadlier to play with this stuff. And unfortunately covid just proved how fast this stuff can spread and that's doing a total lockdown. Imagine if we had just listened to a certain orange man about how its nothing and it will all be gone by a miracle. Too may places are playing with stuff we have next to no idea about but we sure will get hurt by if it leaks out, or worse, is used by a putler type person.
It's clear. Now you are an official Billy boy advertising agency, Kurzgesagt.
This is impressively inaccurate and borders on fear mongering.  This video feels more like someone googled around for an afternoon instead of spending the time to actually research the field. The solutions posed only make sense if you have no comprehension of the subject.  Very disappointing.
Terribly slanted video… embarrassing
I'm really surprised North Korea hasn't already made some deadly virus that broke out and infected the world yet.
Thank you so much for being so dedicated to your mission to provide important knowledge like this in this format for free!!!!!!
Yall watched 12 monkey's recently ehh?
Is this calling out Red Nile? lmao
FYI, whole genome sequencing is less than $500 and less than 24 hours these days. Closer to $300.
Crazy to think humans make viruses they then have to design a cure for. Oops.
7:26  Hehehehe heeheehee
Wanna know what's more deadly than a nuclear bomb?       Someone who knows how to make one.
Yk I’ve seen this happen every time: when something new is made, we somehow weaponize it. EVERY TIME.
I dont think you got this one right. Considering many professionals are saying things.
its almost like we should make sure our world leaders are competent in their roles and make sure we have safe guards to keep leaders transparent when they vote or interact in government
Thank you for this special gift
Man better hope some form of international consensus for this kind of shit either already exists or is about to
4:52 I don't understand why you don't also mention here that when they make stronger versions of viruses they are often skipping the steps that said virus/bad thing would do in nature, and therefore being able to make a stronger and more effective vaccine from the beginning that could potentially still cover any resistant variants or be able to reduce the chance that there aren't any resistant cells left behind by an original vaccine treatment
Well since COVID came from a lab there was already a head start on working on it... Thanks Gates Foundation Front I mean Kurg-whatever you're totally not evil either. 😅
this one feels a little sensationalized, ngl. I get the hype, and don't take issue with the assertion that biotech is accelerating at an incredible pace, but.. i dunno. I think this misrepresents the reality a little too much for the sake of the story.
right, "infohazard", because "thoughtcrime" would be too blatant
4:03 I'm glad the animator (or whoever did the screenwriting for the animator to animate) recognised he could use the little "DNA strand guy" from Jurassic Park here, he(it?) is instantly recognisable lmao
this adds so much to kurzgesagt out of context “imagine building a nuclear bomb in your back yard”
So how exactly do I create a bio weapon to end the world?
Crap
Biologicals are one of my favorite subjects. Thanks for another awesome video
They really should be aiming at checking our DNA for any diseases, allergies and chronic conditions at the early stages of our lives
It’s dishonest to say that the origin of the pandemic stemmed from a bat. It has been well understood for a while since before the posting of this video, that it indeed originated from a lab in Wuhan.

We have to be better at sharing vaccines first. America and Europe always keep vaccines out of reach from Africa and let viruses fester.
Isn't it funny that i thought bio nuclear is actually made out of nuclear too?
Info hazard in a nutshell🦆
😮
When you expose the key to the public, you also expose how to build a better lock. Open Source virus info is good, just like open source code.
Here's a better solution: ban every country and or group that works on, or with bioweapons. Instead work on things like cancer research instead of just making more weapons that don't serve a single good purpose.
This channel is getting funded by china or something,   Why is this channel turning so political? It started with interesting and colourful facts about science.  Now its just promoting different groups or government agendas.
"What if you could build a nuclear bomb in your backyard?" *Ferb I know what to do today*
Huh. Interesting
biotech is godzilla
Present where? 7:26
Alright. I'm done with this stupid channel. You're going to act like the vaccines were a miracle of modern medicine when a quick jaunt to the CDC website shows most have been recalled or earmarked for recall due to their risk of inducing cardiovascular issues? And then you end the video by saying you're going to be more vigilant in your fact checking!? Anyone who still takes Kurzgesagt seriously at this point is an idiot.
I need to read 20th Century Boys again

If you think about it, the reason why natural selection exists is because this process eliminates a group of organisms/individuals with no immunity to certain diseases/phenomena, and if those organisms/individuals die, then said diseases/phenomena will also die, or in the worst case scenario, evolve/mutate, but this is proved to be a slower and normal rate of evolution.   And now, we humans are basically doing the exact opposite of it by eliminating said diseases/phenomena before it could kill us or our fellow humans/animals who are considered unimmune organisms. This means that we are essentially helping said dangerous diseases/phenomena evolve and mutate faster for them to acquire traits that will basically doom the previosuly immune organisms/individuals to them.😂😂😂
Regarding the potential future benefits of biological technology, none of it will matter in the United States as long as we allow lobbyists to control the government. Something must be done about the lobbyists before we can begin to hope for a better future.
Excellent video, keep the hard work.
Gender reassignment surgery on the molecular level? less go!!!
too much money is involved in bio tech, and it isn't disclosed in completely transparent way, which is why nobody shuold trust the biotech companies
China started this with CoVId
3:32 - ROFLMAO... sure we don't.  🤣
I think people missed the mark a little on their videos intention. Personally I am not a microbiologist, but do understand that it's not easy at all to make a superbug in your backyard. The best that people could do would be to replicate an already existing virus or bacteria, over being able to genetically alter something in an instant.   Yet the main point I got was the technology itself is becoming cheaper and more accessible, and the knowledge about it is growing and becoming more public. Allowing more and more people to be able to replicate the same experiments, certainly not to the degree of genetic altering at home. Yet enough that one day someone may be smart or crazy enough to do some serious damage similar to the nuclear boy scout. Whom of which built a nuclear reactor by gathering radioactive elements from household items like smoke detectors and lamp glasses. Which over the span of a few years of collecting built a reactor that was giving off dangerous amounts of radiation. In which he was entirely self taught and used the public information he had to build his reactor.

as i said before plz make a vid on what if the moon was made of cheese
No, nuclear is still more dangerous bevause it will destroy everything and it can last thousands of years before it wears out
Great to know that literally anyone could wipe us out for fun
i really wanna see a video on how possible it would be to change our own body genetically to the point where we wouldnt have to go through a few generations to get a tail back. is it possible to become a real life anthro?
For all the good it could do, it will not stop Doctors from failing to treat patients because "its normal for your age"
"Unknown coronavirus" was "broken down" in Wuhan and totally not manufactured
China already working on Covid-24 for next year :))
I used to enjoy Kurzgesagt but this is all exaggerations and "what if?" scenarios.  The "infohazard" part is especially bad. You should never restrict scientific knowledge! That's how the Chernobyl disaster happened...
About corona virus,i remember the eu have said it was made by humans as a weaponize virus,did you guys not taken that seriously?
When they skimped the intro I thought “oh damn there serious”
Sponsored by the World Economic Forums and Pfizer 😂
And this is what science should be used for. Not rubbish.
4:45 ... new batsh*t virus?
I really do hope that many viruses get released and we revert back to technology from centuries ago. That sounds great to me.
Great video as always.
Is anyone gonna point out that it's only been two weeks since the last video? Someones working overtime in the studio...
Like Covid?
So dangerous we just ignored the CCP making covid and releasing it on....purpose or accident...we STILL don't know. Seems to be no rush for you guys or your political allies to find out now, why? You have power? Was that all that mattered?
Bro this propagandist
Why are all your statements about the dangers of researchers openly sharing information about pathogens sourced to the same person? That's...not how you build a strong argument.
Are you open to a DoD grant?   Real offer.
Oh shit, we found another Great Filter.
Good idea, thanks.
The birds of Krzgesagt gave way to ugly faceless bipedal creaturs that resemble humans. Disappointment
Yeah that super focus vaccine that nurses and doctors call the clot shot in hospitals
Do a video about juice!
So the plot of the division is now going to be a canon event? Fuck
4:47 Read the book
This is so misleading lol... humans trying to play God is a terrible idea..
Scientific breakthroughs are only pursued by the rich to weaponize for the profit for the few. The new religion.
The one thing the scientific community never anticipated... is horse deworming medication.

Most dangerous weapon is social media...
думаю, чтобы создать опасный вирус нужно много тестов, в условном подвале любитель скорее только удачей сделает такое, чем планомерно
Video is all well and good, except it's the people with unquestioned access who are creating these kinds of pathogens. It's no secret that a certain NIH director funds this kind of deadly research in countries that don't care that much about security measures like China, as well as certain high profile "doctors", to even multi-billionaire "philanthropists" who have no medical background to speak of who happen to also fund this channel on occasion.  We can't defend ourselves against these threats when there are those above us who can do whatever they want without scrutiny, because they were never even elected in the first place but are protected by those who are, as well as those who's literal job is to tell us about this stuff.  The only way this kind of biotech stops being a threat, is if such people who do gain of function research are severely punished for it. Such labs should not be allowed to exist, and it shouldn't take a pandemic killing most the world's population (it's inevitable under current laws) before such a law finally gets made.
God set all this up just to play plague inc bruh
While I love y'all's videos, this one is dangerously inaccurate. Following the COVID-19 pandemic and the mass disinformation campaign surrounding it's origins, virologist around the world have seen their field (and at times their safety) put at risk. It is not as easy as the video makes it out to be to source pathogenic materials. All repositories I know of, as a virologist, require a university laboratory address in order to even deliver any ordered materials. Repositories also require additional documentation, such as IBC approvals, before the order is processed. Most, if not all, repositories are also government run; this empowers them to confirm the identities of those ordering pathogenic materials.   Beyond the incorrect information presented with regards to sourcing infectious and pathogenic materials, the video also shares information regarding prevention of disease using techniques not approved for human consumer use. This can easily convince viewers to purchase UV lights and place them in their homes without the proper understanding and safety precautions needed to use UV.   Again while I love your videos, this one is particularly disappointing and I encourage the channel to take it down and revise it with science-backed facts regarding the dangers of infectious agents AND the countermeasures already in place to prevent malicious acts using them.
Im starting to think this Youtube channel is gaverment "science" and woke prpoganda, people are starting to wake up to the lies they told us back in 2020!
scattered and rambling.   what the heck happened to Kurzgesagt?  unwatchable
So Plague Inc is much more possible than we thought, huh?
I don't think I trust you anymore. You are deep in bed with the establishment.
A new virus will be our fault? Who's funding these projects?
Underwhelming video, talked a lot but said nothing :/
Was the I only one watching this wishing scientists would create mutant powers for humans? 😂
This is not a good video
every vid like this is him and his team hinting the who to make stuff like this as we have these peices just dont want to make it till we need it
Repent of your sins and trust in Jesus Christ or hell awaits
A new vid, time to question my existence again........
It is a fact the Covid virus came from a lab... but we know you are forced to say it's still up for debate. Sorry you are unable to speak freely. That must be a burden

Hold the pipettes right!!! Upright straight! not diagonal.
I think all knowledge should be available why should some get the knowledge power and access when they could be the worst ones of them all.
This makes me think about a fictional world of mine where nobody thought about nuclear weapons, but bioweapons are a legal thing
ya no lets not start censoring knoladge  cause then  anything can be labled as an info hazard. it will keep lots of good people from doing good things and the criminals will find ways to get it anyway
Sorry but the 6:27 part was stupid af. So countries don’t hide weapons programs? Who the US the worst one of them all trying to regulate others? Yeah sure right. That was incompetent af to say.
I'm a big fan of Kurzgesagt - need to query the statement around the 'mysterious' origins of Covid; its origin is well-established, along with the near impossibility that it occurred naturally. The question is whether unleashing it upon the world was (a) by design/intention or (b) as a consequence of gross negligence combined with the dysfunction of the Chinese state (which has already been established). Putting the financial and social costs aside, 7m global deaths demand accountability.
Kurzgesagt brought a new video auicker
C0U1D propaganda as usual lately on Kurzgesagt, it's a shame but is really noticeable where the big budget is coming from
When I get my own place I'm gonna have so many Kurzgesagt posters on my walls
vaccine was shit 👎
How can a tiny virus destroy the humanity???☣☣☣☣☣☣
While watching this i got an ad that said i was watching kurzgesagt
I had a bad feeling that this was senseless fear-mongering near the start of the video. I scrolled down to see the comments and was not disappointed. Shame on you, Kurzgesagt. As demonstrated by several comments clarifying points, you have both exaggerated some risks and downplayed/ignored others, producing a video that misleads and misdirects efforts. This isn't the first time I've felt this way about your work, though it's definitely been the most extreme. I'm going to get my science info elsewhere from now on.
i mean u can build phones an whatnot from parts, but apple  wont even let you buy a button to replace by yourself, and if you get one  somehow, it will notice its different and brick itself. we cant have other ppl repairing stuff, its bad for busness, acording tio apple
I'll take you're man-made micro-organism apocalypse, and raise you an ai automated nano bot apocalypse.
Right, because the vaccines are well-tested and guaranteed to be safe. /s
its not unthinkable to hav a vax ready in months, they just did away with the paperwork and tests. so no you have a bunch of people ingluding kids with heart problems lol
Unfortunately, half the population doesn't believe in science so enacting counter measures can't be as effective. I mean, look at how many infants pooped their pampers when asked to wear a mask. A super bug will wipe us out as a result of teamism, unfortunately.
It's the umbrella corporation for me
The artist needs a raise
Imagine if bird flu mutates to kill us with its 60% mortality rate.
I may be lucky but covid did not change my life at all, other than the masks and the shots... otherwise not much difference.
UV lights that destroy viruses before they spread sound like something that if they worked effectively without serious drawbacks would be everywhere already.
hi
Your channel makes me very happy. I always feel great after watching and definitely well informed. Ive been watching them for years and love them dearly
Yes more control! More authoritarianism! Nice! I don't understand what @kurzgesagt is thinking, there is a human in develop country which is going to leave TikTok, Instagram, or some binge watching Netflix series and read some research paper and find the pathogen database etc, etc..., Or human in developing country going to think about pathogen related publish data, by spending half his/her monthly salary, rather than thinking of buying food, etc...
where are the ducks? i miss them
Seems an effective way for Gates, fauci, soros, and schwab like creatures to selectively  depopulate the world.
Giving the Lab Leak theory any level of creedance already turned me off to this video

Wanting to tell us something Kurzg?

Came back to your channel after a few months and the drop in quality of your content is shocking. Your videos are becoming subtle propaganda. Probably won't be long before you become a complete sellout. Let's hope I am wrong.
I don’t think we should try to restrict the sharing of information, plus doing that isn’t easy
Covid-19 didn't come from a wild bat... can we stop pretending yet?

I don't know what the purpose of the video was, but now I want to create a deadly virus on my backyard...
For real though, the idea of increasing the amount of information gatekeeped by people in power of *any* type is incredibly dangerous. As many others have pointed out, it's not as easy as you make it out to be to create a supervirus. You really do need the expert training for it, and the "it costs as much as a small car" claim assumes unrealistically ideal conditions with no wasted money or mistakes, which are both guaranteed for anyone not working under supervision in a controlled environment.
Oh. Like how dr fauci with the gain a function research supplied money to the lab in China that created the covid 19 virus.
even though the symptoms were mild, you don’t know what kind of cancers or secondary diseases you could develop later in life from COVID infection yet.
Weird L take from this channel.  Restricting freedom of information and diving head first into dystopian “info-hazard” and authoritarian limits on peoples freedoms all over a “risk” which has never materialized. Adding to the problems with this narrative,  the people actually weaponizing biology behind closed doors is not the communities of talented individual researchers, but is the exact governments you want to entrust with absolute control over information.    Sad to see this channel go from informative info graphics about scientific topics,  to reactionary calls for political/legislative changes.
Proud to be a biotechnology and biochemistry student
this video makes me feel like im being misinformed
Zombie apocalypse NOW! Let's go!
Claiming that the Corona virus lab leak hypothesis is up for"scientific debate" when 99% of virologists say the genetic composition of the virus confirms it's natural origins, classic Kurzgezagt soft propaganda. Another form of soft propaganda is not mentioning the numerous military biolabs the U.S has abroad, coveniently located near U.S interests and close to U.S "economic competitors".
I want to sincerely thank you guy for providing such thorough citations in your description. That segment on the purchasing of existing viruses and the harm that can create was eye opening, and it was good to see you didn't just make this up for engagement.
Don’t care, give me halo Spartans.
I'm getting flashback's to Vsauce's video where he talks about creating ebola in your home
I love this channel❤
They have cats and fish that glow in the dark or under uv lights, we need to create a glow in the dark ferret,  glo ferret must happen.
That Gates foundation funding sure kicked in eh?. We know where corona came from lol it's actual news now.
I gotta call some bullshit out here. We know for a fact that covid-19 came from a lab in wuhan china and china covered it up. this is propaganda. i expected so muck better than this from this channel.
Yes, they sequenced corona virus "after" it was released accidentally, and certainly not before while they were doing gain of function research. Thanks Eco-health alliance!
I don't know why I am still subscribed to this propaganda channel....  We know full well where covid-19 came from....
Im the only one u needa worry bout.
Same concept with nuclear weapons. Anyone can make a nuclear weapon. But when was the last time you heard a terrorist use a nuclear weapon? Never. Just because you can make one doesn't mean you can deliver it. Same concept with bio weapons
💰TALKS  VERY SADLY!
Legalize Nuclear Bombs!
The virus came from a lab... it's been confirmed... cmon bro
In the future, every room indoors turning into a permanent clean room feels like a distinct possibility.
How do dogs have bio-tech?
7:26 What?!
AKA welcome to the plot of The Division by Ubisoft 😂😂
What you're talking about is gain of function, it's called biological weapons. This channel used to be a lot cooler before it hopped on the propaganda train. Must be all that Gates foundation money.
We should not eliminate information. For every bad actor there is a good actor.
*it was easy to know about the C VD cos it was made in a lab!!!!*
WTF Kurzgesagt! Your level of research on this topic is disappointing. You should stick to your circle of competence. Typically I love your videos but this one is way off the mark. Clearly, you have no understanding of what is possible in molecular biotechnology and what current regulatory processes are in this field. Medicine and plant biotech are among the most heavily regulated field there are. Period. Your video is disgraceful!
This video is incredibly fear-mongering   You can’t just order DNA sequences online and the information isn’t just freely available  Quite oppositely of what the video states governments and academic organizations track the information very carefully and guard the methods very closely
The coof-coof 18+1 was created in a lab. The "vhacksynes" were created alongside it, side by side. Don't lie to us with your Byll Ghates money.
Uuuh... Anyone thinking the Church was onto something with the whole not so free information sharing? Maybe we were just not meant to mess wih the laws of nature and stuff? I might go back to my cave. Maybe the amish are also onto something...
Bio technology is born from bio weapon
So your solution is more authoritarianism, no thanks

This is all hyper-exaggeration and assumption. There are many, may checks to these things and monitering.
You should make some Displate posters.
This video is extremely misleading. Also, not just anyone can order dna from companies lol, you have to be part of uni/lab, and your order is most definetely tracked, at least in US/EU. Don’t really like the message of overregulation when there is already regulation. Not really a good video tbh
Information control never works. At best it delays the inevitable, at worst it causes even more of the reckless action it was intended to prevent. Putting aside the absolutely IMPOSSIBLE logistics of setting up an all-knowing benevolent authority that controls who should and shouldn't have access to certain information --- even then you're just creating a time bomb that no one is prepared for. Even if it was possible, and it is NOT, you'd be giving more power to the same bad actors you're so worried about. Just one leak, one person, can take a well kept secret and use it on a world that is not prepared because it was hidden in the first place. Information control doesn't make a safe world, it makes an unprepared world.

Yeah, I always thought domestic dogs were mutants. Ugly disfunctional mutants.
I think they teamed up with mark rober cause he got experience with these types of stuff

This video's topic is extremely important in a post pandemic world. I don't think the presentation and accuracy holds up to the standards of your other videos, unfortunately.
To all the people that say that buying viruses is very difficult, etc. Well, it might be so in your country, I assure you the regulations are not so strong everywhere else :(
Wow, what a misleading video. one that not simply makes a bioweapon in your backyard (and survives). And it is suspicious the emphasis of the video in the "freely spread of information"
I feel like I’m watching a Sci-fi video and it’s weird realizing it’s not. Like a lot of y’all’s videos are wild but this is just insane to think about
Unthinkable to give a vaccine in the middle of a pandemic, that is.
Thank you this is truely fascinating
Whether its Biological, Mechanical or Nuclear, if Humanity is to be undone it will be by its own hubris.
I'd like to get more information on those specialized UV lamps, but I'm not sure where to start. If YOU know where to find this information, please reach out right away, so I can dive into researching it.
7:11 Not anyone can. There always is permits and bureocracy in between.
Nuclear weapons are hard, but evolution has been doing Bioweapons forever, it's hardly difficult.  We are surrounded by them. Trying to restrict information in this field is a bad idea.  You can't ban nature itself.

i want the original shitty version of the evoltution tree as a poster
7:25 are present what?
You can even buy the equipment second hand, and the weapon has already been created. Stupidly the weaponised versions of particular viruses can still be created. You can't buy them but with fake credentials can buy what is required to create them. It is not hard to do it, but it is hard to do safely. You will probably infect yourself first which will put you on the radar, thankfully. I am not going into details for good reason but it's only a matter of time before some idiot with the equipment does it. Nature does a good job of knocking us off, someone bankrolled by rogue terrorist nation or even crowdfunding could do a better job. We don't stand a chance and frankly it's too late to put that cat back in the bag. What's harder than doing it? Preventing it.
Absolutely brain dead take... go head double down on the biggest missteps of the scientific community during the pandemic, lets see how that works out for you.
wouldn't it be pretty easy to link a dna ordering service to a viral dna database to deny orders of viral dna? in fact i feel like i've heard of ppl already doing that from like a Thought Emporium video or smt
Biology sounds dangerous, we need to ban it.
Thank you for the artificial and needless panicmongering
Uma empresa capitalista como toda empresa, não tem consideração pelo público se não tem lucro.
But don't worry, the idea that CoVid 19 was engineered in a lab is just a crazy alt right conspiracy theory
I think towards the end what you meant to say but didn’t was that you had to needlessly over compensate due to our ridiculous inability to know what to take seriously to an extreme from you and what obviously not too and manage our own fkng expectations and childish pedanticness

Thanks for the monthly dose of existential dread. It’s good for the soul.
The false equivalence made between COVID's animal origin vs. the lab origin theory is pretty absurd. The lab origin theory has not yet had compelling evidence presented.
What an odd video. I'd be happy if we could just trust government funded laboratories from creating deadly strains of viruses. Why don't you start there? (And we don't need to come up with climate change resistant plants. Carbon is plant food. The plants will do better than ever in more regions if it's warmer. Try following science instead of narratives.)
❤❤💕💕
when we are able to, i can make my cats and my dog live longer
Basically A.I..
20 MILL SUBS!!
biotech is awesome! i plan on learning more about making plants more efficient under the current climate change
It's now an unspoken rule - you see a Kurzgesagt video, you click it.
U made korean CH for us. However , i love ur voice
Ya this totally isnt bill gates funded propaganda... At this point you are are completely compromised evil wef shills.
The last additional explanation = U guys underestimated the internet and your audience. My sister juggle jobs in entertainment industry, be careful with what u post...  That being said, I LOVE this channel! 👍
Whether its Biological, Mechanical or Nuclear, if Humanity is to be undone it will be by its own hubris.
this is my favorite channel on all of youtube ngl
I want them to get busy and invent an infection that makes right wing people compulsively read _and understand_ scientific journals. And also shut their mouths  when they want to talk to anyone, ever, anywhere in the world.
Lol we need to keep poor nations poor.
Extremely dissapointed in this video, lots of uninformed fearmongering based on bunk science or none at all. Much lower quality than your normal output- A microbiologist.
We are approaching real life plague inc.
It was created in a laboratory!
I’m sorry but COVID was created and they had a vaccine in advance. Let’s not spread the scam that COVID was just a coincidence
Covid-19 isn't "mild". Even without heavy symptoms you can be permanently crippled. Every new infections augment your "chance" to develop : diabetus, cardio-vascular diseases, long covid (caused by neurones fusion), etc etc... "Mild".
I don't think we can prevent it
Watching one of these videos is the best way to start my day.
I like the idea, But controlling biology seems a bit reckless, because there is a certain point where we should not just mess with it. In my opinion we should just let mother nature deal with that, But thoughts are open!
For the bloody algorithm
This dude keeps giving ideas to super villains of this world.
bio technology progressing aye, where are the cat girls
Patients zero were in the lab. Confirmed
We better get this under lock & key. It won't be long until a terrorist uses this to erace an entire race of people using Viruses that attack specific DNA.
HE SWEARED 4:45 PAUSE IT LOOK AT THE BOOK
I think this video should have been made in a few years I don’t think that we really know enough about the future to make these assumptions
Great video
The batdemic lmao
:o
It was a lab leak.  FACT.
A game with these type of animations will be cool
The key word in this was infohazard.
KURZGESAGT: What if you could build a nuclear bomb in your backyard?  MICHIO KAKU: No one is allowed to do that but I did made an atom smasher in my high school days
"We still dont know"  We know. That's why your bringing it up in THIS video.
Welp... I didn't need to sleep for the next month.
so, a zombie virus is possible?
7:26 ඞඞඞඞඞඞඞඞඞ
Molecular biologist here, and my area of study was in vaccines and counter-bioterrorism. As with all Kurzgesagt videos, this one is very on-point and accurate. However, there is something I came to realize working in this field--which is that humanity is only going to survive rapidly advancing technology if it creates a society that eliminates the causes of radicalization and bad actors.  Simply put, the amount of damage a single bad actor can do has advanced exponentially over the last thousand years, and that's only going to advance further along with technology. Taking actions like regulating access to select DNA/RNA is only going to go so far when people can literally build bio weapons using common soil organisms and readily-accessible materials.  The only long-term way we're going avoid some very doomsday scenarios is by removing the things that create bad actors, and we do that by having an insanely robust mental and physical health system, virtually zero income inequality, virtually zero religious extremism, and basically ensure everyone is as content and fulfilled as possible.
Yes, I agree it can be dangerous to have biotech be this open, but this danger is greatly exaggerated here, and definitely takes away from the first part "free and open exchange of information has greatly accelerated development". We need to be wary of any attempt to lock down biology by corporations that would rather have a monopoly on research to make a profit. Science being free from profit motive has got humanity where it is today, we can't kill that progress.  All this being said, Open Philanthropy's interest is with corporations wishing to turn biotech into a walled garden under the guise of "safety". I really want to believe Kurzgesagt when you say they have no narrative control, but the overlapping narrative is too suspicious.
04:52 ah yes the gain a function done by fauci and wuhan lab , which caused the corona virus incident , that at the time was deadly but now you call it mild , yes that
I'm just glad that Kurzgesagt is willing to leave the political stuff mostly aside to foster and speak on stuff in a more descriptivist way an encourage pure learning and scientific curiousity. Much respect.
IIRC, back in 2018 some Canadians were able to create a variant of a very deadly virus almost completely from scratch (either polio or measles, I don’t remember) just using DNA and RNA bought on the Internet.
nah it's the gas attack that is my fart
I wanted to go into Biotech and I'm glad there's a lot I could do.
idk, I don't really trust the government to have so many ways to destroy humanity. Are you sure they're not among the wrong people who shouldn't have access to this stuff?
Here is a question: Are you willing to sacrifice your privacy to the sake of leaning bio-technology? I'm fine with it, but I can imagine many would say no.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I find it funny how during the pandemic, if you even suggested that the virus was created in the lab, you would be lambasted and hunted down and lose your livlihood. now it's a matter of 'scientific debate'.
Thank you for this video 💓💓
wow! so many vids! i am about to eat my momma meal while watching this and slowly going to sleep after i finish thank you its gonna be great time.
Brought to you in part by pfizer
Called it, it was Money
Anyone ever read I Am Pilgrim?? It’s about this exact thing! It inspired me to go into molecular biology :)
This channel used to cover real science. Now it's just low effort clickbait. Sorry it had to be said.
Oh wow, another new video in just two weeks, I am LOVING this!  Keep them coming!
OMG, IS THAT JURRASIC PARK REFERENCE

6:48 Loved that resident evil reference! Whenever I hear bio-tech that franchise always comes to mind
1:45 because it's easier now than it was 20 years ago so if its easier it takes less time to do and is therefore cheaper
0:31 Such a beautiful wolf.. Also reminds me of how dirty we did pugs...
7:25 amogus
It's so disappointing, the amount of time and energy we spend in trying to kill eachother faster and more efficiently... All that energy could be used to how to help eachother and live on this planet more safely...
"We still don't know where it came from"  ............   Yes. Yes we do. It was "leaked" from the lab!
soooo coagulation cascade poster when? :D
you should make a video on the phage known as minosphrime
3:50 umbrella corp
You guys are amazing. I'm so happy this content exists.
Something felt off about this video. It doesn't have the same soul that most kurzgesagt videos have. Even when kurzgesagt videos make you feel small, they don't make you feel helpless, they make you hopeful. They're supposed to get you excited about science and the open sharing of information, not make you fearful of it. Kurzgesagt missed the mark with this one... It all feels wrong.
Paranoid mode
Yes, track every thought criminal that dares to show curiosity. Keep making the smartest people resent society. What could go wrong.
Nukes can wipe out humanity and leave the entire planet a smoldering ruin.  Bioweapons can wipe out humanity and leave everything else intact.
The idea that a dangerous man-made virus is more likely to come from some single lone wolf, rather than a state-sponsored actor with access to everything we lock away is silly. Restricting access to information is never the answer - it's evil and detriment to humanity as a whole.
How long until I can take a pill or get a shot that will make me young and fit again and stay that way forever?
You need to do more research. Talking about stuff you know nothing about makes me question a lot of your other content
i love the umbrella reference to resident evil! also, your usual intro with logo was missing from this vid in case you were unaware :)
Gain of function research - novel coronavirus lab - look into it...
Bruh, nah, the covid vaccine has been proven to not only be false but dangerous. Trying to make a vaccine for covid is like making one for the common cold, it's way too aggressive and way too volatile to be done that soon
what happened to the birds?
It sounds really dangerous to never use your immune system tho
That's why I LOVE this channel. Not only because you bring us the very best scientific content, but also because you guys are not afraid of admitting some mistake you might make. This is top level humbleness. Thanks for everything!
Clearly the answer is deterrence. The only way to stop a bad guy with a rapidly spreading exceptionally lethal immune-supressing environmentally stable airborne virus that can infect a wide variety of hosts and spread to humans from them is a good guy with a rapidly spreading exceptionally lethal immune-supressing environmentally stable airborne virus that can infect a wide variety of hosts and spread to humans from them.
Oooh, this is the plot to White Plague
Make a video on warp drives
Making an IPhone from scratch? No way will Apple allow that. Lol SMH
DO NOT SKIP TO 7:26!!
Sad to see the decrease in quantity. But damn is the quality of these videos great!
The more I watch your videos, especially the recent ones, the more I believe you lost yourselves to science fanatism. You guys dwelve so deep into your subjects you stop wondering about their actual value. "Tech is good because it's tech, the only way forward is more, innovation will solve all our problems". This approach is the reason  why we're on the brink of extinction  The first half of the video sounded like a nightmarish dystopia (that we kinda already experience, anyway), and according to you that was the positive aspects of biotech...  "Biotech is so great, we'll cure man-made diseases and offset the burning temperature of climate change with enginereed corn !"  It's so delusional I don't even know where to start. I would only suggest to get into philosophy of science, maybe like Latour for instance, and consider having a more diverse pool of experts to check your scripts.  In the meantime, i'm out of here
This was the point of The Andromeda Syndrome. Humanity has known for 90 years how we can destroy ourselves quickly... from using the strong nuclear forces in the atom. Biological and chemical weapons have been used for thousands and thousands of years.
i thought the fake evolutionary chart was funny idve put something like that on my wall
I guess the upside to this is most of the people who'd want to cause _this_ much destruction on a global scale with so little regard for their own safety are religious extremists, particularly of the Abrahamic faiths, and most of them tend to dislike science in general so it's unlikely they'd know how to use one of these for their purposes without getting themselves killed long before they let it loose on anyone else.
For the first time I disagree with Kurzgesagt. If someone wants to make bioweapons, there are prions, the most widely known version of which is "mad cow disease". No treatment exists, they are always deadly, and they are extremely difficult to prevent. So there is no point, please just let science to remain open and accessible to everyone.
Bro just dropped the hardest edit about biology 🔥🔥🔥🔥 💯💯🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
Please do not lie about Covid, we knew day 1 it was highly likely to have come from a lab working on precisely these variants of viruses, whereby there was an incident a week or two before Covid starting. The wet market nearby wasn't selling "bats" and bats were not known in that area, not for another 900 KM.
I got anxiety watching the test tube roll towards the edge of the desk at 4:33.
We just need to do these three simple things. Oh yeah, and one of them requires a worldwide totalitarian government.
I love your work and you guys. ;*
This is how it always is with new technologies. The phrasing I've heard is that we're in the wild west era.  Like in the 1980s, the internet was severely under-regulated and many illegal websites proliferated. While those sites still exist, our methods for protecting against them have gotten better and our cultures have adapted to account for the increased dangers.  The same will happen with machine learning and genetic engineering as we reach the point where we know enough to stop any real dangers
3:35 no we know for sure it came from a bat...
I have hope for this future, Imagine a world where we could alter our immune system to make it immune to all viruses and make it better at detecting Cancer.
Re: COVID killed at least 7 million? That is a very least "at least." Real number is probably 24 million dead already, 3.5 million more dead per year for years to come, mostly from worsening health after "recovering." I would be shocked if we don't reach 35 or 40 million by the end of this decade.
I don't know you but, the transition to the main topic without the usual Kurzgesagt intro feels.. weird.
i want to be a microbiologist and experiment on ways to weaken viruses, not cure them. i wish i have some lab equipments and virus samples because i have a frequency that someone tried and it helped his covid symptoms by lessening them
❤🙏
Is nuclear.
Based on how a lot of the population reacted to covid and getting vaccinated.. I'm pessimistic humanity will survive through a bio WMD..
7:26
Yeah, okay, this was a bad video guys. I have great respect for your channel and your work, but what you've done here is a critical overstatement of facts for what appears to be shock value. Biology is a lot less cut and dry than nuclear power after all, and experts seem to agree that it's significantly harder to create a super plague than what was presented, even if the process gets cheaper in the future.   Frankly I'm disappointed.
This channel is amazing, I love how the content can encourage people to study and learn hard for the benefit of our species and the well being of our mother planet.
am i the only one to get hyped by new type of music 😅
Bro just gave me an IDEA
I think this "Anyone can make a bio weapon and kill millions" message they're trying to send is more of a "it could happen in the near future at the rate the technology is progressing"
Oh so now we can admit rona chan wasnt a big deal. Glad we wrecked the world for it tho.
Time to end humanity
There isn't a debate about whether or not Covid19 was the result of a lab leak or zoonotic spillover. Any dissenting experts in their fields have been silenced by their institutions, financers, and governments. I love Kurzgesagt and have for years, but it's borderline gas lighting to state we need to be afraid of some guy named Greg printing a superbug and not absolutely mortified of the ongoing research into gain of function. If we can't hold existing public institutions to account, how would you EVER enforce such a restriction on individuals?
What about the combination of freely accessible AI with biotechnology?   Generating sequences of nucleotydes and submitting it to certain pattern evaluations is a piece of cake for AI
Some false information in this video: we absolutely _do_ know where COVID came from, and it was no bat.  Also, the video calls it "relatively mild". Not that I disagree, but it's just weird that saying as much would've got this channel censored two years ago, ain't it?
There should be a 4th requirement:  -Governments shall not, in any part, habe any control or directive over researchers or doctors before, during, and after a pandemic. The health field should be totally independent.
all it takes is one slip up by someone, and we’ll all be playing plague inc for free
0:15 Bottle o' Enchanting
Something about this video feels icky and rubs me the wrong way.
The same and worst can be said about creating a renegade AI. Both are potentially catastrophic.
This is very controversial. Regulating this sector means limiting the freedom of the open world, Commercial sectors will be able to be better and make all the money, We will not be able to evolve like this.
Just like covid-19.
Imagine the two last small pox in the world suddenly got leaked
It definitely came from a lab there’s no debate about that. And we know what lab
Why does this feel like a propaganda video worthy of Starship Troopers?
This is just fearmongering.
I would love to see Kurzgesagt posters in schools. They’re so cool to look at and at the same time really informative. I know they’d start an interest in science in me if I saw one when I was younger
That vaccine has caused so many people to have health problems arround my circle i would not think of it as any form of achievement.
*It has to be this way intensifies*
We don't know if covid originated from a lab? Are you for real lmao? It's clearly a lab leak.
Don't give them ideas 😮‍💨
But you guys still don't have a cure for like disease.
Easier solution. Total ban of all Biotech sales, materials and equipment to China.
The original BBC series Survivor (1975) was based on this concept of a deadly lab leaked virus decimating the human population to medieval numbers. There was a remake in 2008 but I never saw that oe.
So we are on 9/12 Monkeys.
Ah yes, the usual kurzgesagt L
this is fearmongering
I’m actually currently in my third year studying Biotechnology. I love Kurzegagt content and I was so happy to see you do a Btech video explaining its dangers and wonders!
I think the covid vaccine didn't start from scratch. They had been working on a vaccine for the common cold for a long time, and I think the vaccine came from that.
Congratulations you have told 1M+ people how to wipe out humanity lol
suddendly, biotechnology stops what happends? copyright and trademark laws get them!  which happends to every single scientific area...  *sigh*
Loved the UMBRELLA CORP reference 😊
4:45  First time Kurzgesagt Had a swear word in their vid ( on the book it says bat shit virus)
Better farming practices would go further to dealing with the food crisis than bioengineering, but nobody wants to listen.
Hello! So is every poster super scientifically accurate? or at least extremely accurate at time of purchase? if a new discovery happens a year later that disproves whatever is on the poster, that's acceptable. But I want to know if everything is accurate at the time I buy it?
Seems like its only a matter of time before designer babies comes about. Then probably the cosmetic age will be next... You might see actual furries walking down the street someday if you live long enough.
Could Kurzgesagt make a video similar to this on molecular modelling? It’s been a very useful tool for chemists, but because we’ve made them able to aim for non-toxic chemicals, we can easily switch it around to aim for extremely toxic chemicals. Neurotoxins stronger than any currently existing have been predicted by these models, but thankfully their structure was deleted and not distributed in the paper they wrote about it.
3:50 ! I knew it!! UMBRELLA! I want Ada Wong, Jill Valentine and Claire Redfield, come with me! Chris, Leon, and Hunk you know what to do, take out Wesker! Me and th girls will be in Vegas for..uh, research...let us know how it turns out..d>_0b
That make So much money and double or triple pharma compagny profits, So… ethic? Human health? They dont give a fuck.
Wait, does the vaccine have side effects or no? --answer that science man
It's just like Metal Gear Solid
The last one was our fault
In the future, fictional companies like Umbrella might become real
Keeping the sequences secret will work as well as trying to keep the De-CSS key secret.
I’m currently in school on a biotechnology track and this video reminded me of just how cool the field can be :)
12 Monkeys is coming to life...
I miss the actually educational content that was on this channel. I feel as though the videos have been Mrbeastafied (is that a word?) with newer videos centered around topics about crazy powerful organisms and potential apocalypses in different forms with titles or thumbnails in a clickbait format.
Fortunately we'll have our AI deities to protect us!
Ya'll have slid far with this fear mongering.
isnt it funny, 186 countries around the world got together on 3 seperate occasions on this exact topic, put in these exact measures, with the threat of being exiled form the global trade market, and yet in 2020 a dangerous biological agent just "escapes" and causes a worldwide pandemic that people had been warning we wernt prepared for for 15 years, which is after 15 years of secrtetly developing the vaccine technology holding the pattons and continuing the mutations until you got a deadly virus. what came of that? what countries were exiled out of the global trade market? what countries were responsible for messing around with the MOST dangerous aspects known to humanity that we all agreed 3 times over 50 years that the risks of an accident far exceeds any potential benefit that could ever come of the research. oh thats right, its the people fault for not taking vaccines that didnt do what they were prmomised and didnt stop a single case from being spread that we decided to take away their jobs, imprison them seperate families, destroyed buisness's and livlihoods over because the people are the monsters causing the problems. so what to take away form all of this. governmental incompetance beyond imagination paired with corporate piracy and espionage destorying lives, and the answer for that is apperently more regulation by the people who were responsible for it and outlaw it from anyone else so that no1 can study it, question the authority, and to let the free market have access to it to find the best solution. all makes sense doesnt it?
This video kinda lacking behind the normal Kurzgesagt quality standard. Also the thumbnails look more clickbaity these days, c'mon guys...
Why did you omit the opening?
Restricting information seems like a slippery slope
❤
hmm.. interesting
Gotta be careful with the info hazard part because companies could use it as a excuse to literally block off vehicle engines to quote "keep people from something that could be dangerous" and they have tried a basic version of that already but by giving them the legislation they could potentially legally do that forcing you the car owner or electronic device owner to go back to the manufacturer for heavily inflated repair costs and were already seeing advertisements playing in these hyper connected cars consoles now along with mandatory subscriptions to access things like heated seats until we have protections in place to keep the greedy companies politicians from abusing such a law we should avoid creating info hazard laws.
Luckily. Some will survive. Our body defense is sufficient. Also social distancing works on all biological threats. Unfortunately, the weaker young or old may pass on.  Bacteria or virus strain which kills hosts tend not to spread far and wide.
I'd really love a tshirt or poster of the wolf at 0:32 . Maybe even a more detailed version in your style, but if not, that one already looks amazing
Radioactive spiders. Lol, always love references!
Straight out of Kurzgesagt's biggest sponsors mouth, Bill Gates, you sold your soul to the devil, unsub!
the umbrella reference 💀
7:12 Security by obscurity doesnt work Kurzgesagt, you of all people should know that.  *Im disappointed in you*  Bad people will always have access to this sort of stuff, you're only keeping the curious out, and plunging the general population into obscurity.  The only way to prevent these, is to educate everyone about how they work, not hide it, because malicious assholes will find a way, *that i guarantee you.*  Edit: Tracking is a slippery slope, if you're tracking someone "with bad intentions" who gets to decide what counts as "bad intentions"? I'd like to remind you that the difference between a terrorist and a pro-democracy resistance fighter is *only* a matter of perspective aswell.  *Disliked. Do better.*
You got it wrong with the covid 19 vaccines. that vaccine was created alongside the virus with gain of functions to create the virus in china with us money .
This is the first ever kurzgesagt video I have disliked.
Alright, time to make a deadly virus to wipe out the world.
6:42-6:48 Some random Indian guy: Ok so I’m going to teach you how to make a bio weapon.
How did he know i was watching a kurzgesagts video?
Something you missed about this, is that they are also researching antibodies and other things USING that freely shared data, in fact i believe that there are programs to auto compute antibodies from a gene sequence directly.
Could you please make a video on gun laws?
Never going to happen. This channel content is based on cheap sensationalism. It's so well animated and has so much technical quality it tricks people into believing. It's the same thing as talking about overpopulation decades ago, "these things will keep happening and then boom", and guess what? People just stopped having children
Just one thing that wasnt touched upon: the more dangerous a disease is, the harder it spreads - cant spread it to anyone if youre dying in your bed and cant kill you if youre just among everyone all day. Covid started more dangerous and got weaker but more infectuous over time
Nice reference to umbrella cooperation
2:40 Not going to happen because giant corporations dont want you to build or repair your own devices, because that doesnt make them much money
I really disagree with the pro censorship message of this video. Information and research should always be disseminated, “infohazard” means “rich and powerful people can do whatever they want with no oversight”
covid came from a lab, there is no such thing a scientific debate, there is who is right and who is wrong
Let’s start with banning China from EVER having the opportunity to get its hands on these.
The elites created those viruses to kill us. it's not natural. it's manipulated
The real enemies were the weapons we got to know along the way
It is exponentially more likely that the next pandemic is zoonotic in nature and comes from an animal vs. from accidental/malicious human action.  So long as we confine animals by the billions for our food system, we are destined to ever increasing outbreaks.
Great, now I have to add "Some jackass going full Umbrella Corporation in his parents' garage" to my list of reasons to be completely paranoid. Definitely needed that anxiety in my life.
Wow covid went from the literal grim reaper to mildly affecting people, holy shit I hate everyone who just bandwagons with the rest of the sheeple. Liberal sissys
You shit on china? demonetized!
Ah yes, time for my monthly dose of existential crisis
7:26
Nice astroturf lobbiest video
This video felt particulary nebulous. Less based on reality, more based on a bit of bias.
Feel like the animation quality has increased, but the amount of information has decreased
Btw your link on the video description isn’t linking (gotta manually type it in)
I sequenced my genome for 250eur. Base by base.
I became intressted when he said "what if you could build a nuclear bomb in your backyard"
imagine  nuclear bomb going off in a volcanic site, would different size volcanoes affect the explosion differently, would the ashes be contaminated with nuclear waste, how hard would the cleanup be and how far would the atmosphere and winds take said nuclear ashes? I came up with idea of a terrorist cell targeting certain places in the world that would have disastrous effects and to which I want to figure out a way for cleanup if said event is possible. knock on wood hoping it will never come to fruition.
Access to ingredients is cloooselt monitored, it is already much harder to do "casual" biotech work.
I feel like this will certainly be one of our future 'Great filters'. It may not come as soon as well think, but this threat is very real. We're all humans; people who have a lot of power and make decisions, both good and bad. There's already horrible people who exist in this world that attempt to take out as many people as possible with them. I'd rather not see that on an even bigger scale. Care should be taken to ensure that science doesn't outpace laws and safe practices.
Why is the education system so terribly lackluster? If it was good our political system wouldn’t be so out of order.
7:26 is super duper really funny
We extracted dna from a strawberry for seventh grade and that was around ten years ago.
ok but where was the intro?
At the beginning the covid vaccine was mentioned and I still think it's incredible that there were talks how we wouldn't see a vaccine until next year or the earliest in December, yet we made one in June and it was ready to be used. Soon after it there were others who also made their versions. Not going to go into the controversies of the companies that made the vaccines or what certain countries did or didn't do with them. Now's not the time for that, that's a story for another time.  I'll edit this when I watch the whole video.
I love your videos, but this one seems strangely half-baked and confusing. It doesn’t seem nearly as well crafted and researched as the last one about cancer. What’s going on?
So: Secure, Contain, Protect.  Did I get that right?
And yet, its baffling how much misinformation was spread during the COVID pandemic. One that always pissed me off was people comparing how long it took take make a vaccine for the spanish flu to how long it took to make a COVID vaccine and stating that thats why you shouldnt trust it. Completely forgetting that that was 100 years ago and innovation and an open community enables things to be made faster. Like seriously, those people mist not believe in planes, amazon, cars, or fast food or anything else that does things quicker than anything 100 years ago 😂😂
The moment someone says climate change, all their credibility is immediately lost. Political bias has no place in science.
If I created a weaponized virus, I’d call it Captain Trips.
Lets get this straight. The most dangerous weapon in the world is rightwing propaganda.
Nice, i can do this now  thx
Kurzgesagt seems to be spending less of each video teaching important information and more of each video saying "here's something scary and here's what we should do about it". There are many social issues that are important but you cant just share the bare minimum of information then tell people what the solution is, the way things used to be done on this channel with a backdrop of politics on occasion but primarily focusing on the science and facts with a little suggestion for a solution was much better than what feels like propaganda to watch.
My fear isn't with the intentional stuff, nor is it viruses. It's a scenario like in the movie I am Legend, where good intention turns bad.         Even if it isn't zombies, things like gen modding(both humans and plants/animals) and medicine can easily turn horrid, imagine a scenario where a crop that is used in baby food or something is modded to strengthen the childs immune system but everyone who eats it becomes infertile, it may be decades before the problem shows it self but at that point it's too late.  Such an event may be more dangerous than even nukes, similar things has happened with chemicals in some places but it's often contained to minor areas like specific towns.
Certain sections of this video feel uncomfortably (for me) more clickbaity and sensationalistic than your other videos; it's ok to do this once in a while but please don't make it a trend or worse, a habit, continue to be the gleaming lighthouse in the sea of infographic channels please, thank you kurzgasagt.
Imagine what we could do without everything being profit-driven.
Missed opportunity to have a Flare virus cameo
You used spicyy 🙌🏻 I totally invented that slang😂 💯 7:24
true smallpox genetic code is available online ive been thinking about making smallpox myself just to see if it really infects people
Great video!
Homework then: write a report about what you thought was interesting about the book Homework in the future: optimize and explain a pathogen that would've wiped out humanity in a chosen era
that umbrella symbol scared me!
I just read the book "Remade" and I really don't need that kind of videos TnT
Im kinda scared that people get bad ideas from this
Why don't ya'll do your intros anymore?
Funny thing is, despite how anti-bible this channel is; mass spread of "pestilence" frequently; is exactly what the bible prophecies. Luke 21:11
I think it's deeply irresponsible to talk about COVID lab-leak conspiracies as if they're credible when they really aren't. Pretty disappointed in this blatant fearmongering EDIT: LMAO they completely double downed on this shit by changing the thumbnail and video title.
I think i now what I'm going to do to day
Shout out to Doctor Bombastic for making a bomb tutorial.
You can build a nuke in your backyard.  In fact David Hahn built a semi-functional breeder reactor in his yard, and Cody'slab made a video on how to refine uranium.
I like the sneaky stuff Kurzgesagt hides in their videos, like the "Stars War and Trek" poster. Then the Stars Trek and Sneeze poster also.
Solutions to problems we cant imagine: where are the catgirls
I want to bee a biotech engeneer or some other engeneer
You should do a video on how humanity might create aliens, i.e. changing the dna of or creating entirely new plants, animals, and microbes. I think this topic would tie in very well with a terraforming episode.
WHERE DID THE BIRDS GOOOOOOOOOO
It will also be much easier to create a panacea in your back yard. I'm not worried about it.
Don't think I missed that swear word you sneak people - 4:45
Perhaps the next video can be about the origins of covid
These videos and this channel is one of the best thing on YT and on the whole internet.
Kurzgesagt is the only channel that makes me get hooked to an ad
Oppenheimer 2 gonna be crazy
7:26 HAHA AMONG US GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
They need to speed this up so I could be in my prime while the zombie apocalypse is happening.
4:09 KURZGESAGT IN SPIDER-MAN ACROSS THE SPIDERVERSE CONFIRMED
UVC lamp scene was cringe 🫣, you can see there the lack of real world fact checking. Sponsored experts aren’t really good to rely on! Please improve!
>the vegetables you eat Funny thing, I don't eat any vegetables 😂
Kurkegesaut thank you again for making it impossible to sleep ever again 😅
Added side note, make handles, and puash plates (generally used on doors), and such, out of brass for its self sterilisation property. I love the videos you all make, and i appreciate the huge effort that goes into making a video. Thank you.
Too bad that impressive vaccine was actually worthless
7:25 😂😂😂😂😂😂Amongus😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Sus😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂the voices😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂THEY WONT STOP😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂HELP😂😂😂😂😂😂SUSSY😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Haha, remember when the media companies were censoring people (including doctors and scientists) who talked about the likelihood that Covid came from the Wuhan lab, until they decided to give us "permission" to talk about it, and then we all pretended that didn't happen?  xDDD good times, good times.
I am sorry but the things said about doing biotech at home is just very unrealistic. I am working in Biotech and every little thing is expensive as hell. As a trained biochemist/geneticist etc., doing top notch biotech at home where you manage to get "breakthrough discoveries" every few years would only be possible as long as you have a huge funding or being a multi millionaire if not billionaire who can afford all the expensive devices, including service contracts and the staff who can operate it properly.
I have concerns about this one. Particularly on pinning our hopes on something our politicians across the globe failed to enforce. Even in the US where we have legal precedent that already allowed enforcement we had a widespread rejection of it that was just allowed after a brief, half-hearted attempt. And even that barely trying attempt was viewed by the nutter fringe as somehow dictatorial.
"Hey guys, Mark Rober here. Lately, my neighbors have been pretty anoying, and I could not sleep well these past few days, so I felt that I had to teach them a lesson..."
But we do know that covid came from a lab...
the good part will not happen.... if you know humans just a bit
Hank green: *Science is not right or wrong, it's only true*
Hey, about the key 3 bullet points, aren´t we leaving the door open for regulation to be put in place to protect intellectual property? like, it is true that it is dangerous if misused, but we are missing a side effect of that, this should not become a tool for potential gatekeeping of propetary genes made by big vaccine producers, from being available for everyone to create.  like, if there is gene therapy for some disease that anyone with the right equipement can create, but you get a lawsuit from a big company that did it first because it had the means to do so faster, it is not good for us as a species... We are ONCE AGAIN, putting profit making before human benefit, only the rich will have access yet again, to life saving medication.
I just heard the word "infohazard" used in a completely serious real-world context, as opposed to the SCP wiki. The fact that such a thing really can exist is horrifying but completely true.
Yay they uploaded idk if that's a good thing though
First time I have seen a video with no intro! =O
Kurz, don't you think that you're overdoing it with fearmongering?
1, what just happened?
You could have taken the story from the game "The Division" for this because it is pretty much the plot: A digital blueprint with modifications smuggled, some easy to get bio equipment and one expert when it comes to viruses. This episode reminded me so much about the game, it almost made me feel uneasy.
Everyone talking about how cool the video is while I'm just sitting here wondering where the kurzgesagt intro is.
while the theoretical danger of a man made virus is real, this video is pretty overblown. Most notably, all of the "dangerous virus research" happening is rapidly improving our abilities to treat and respond to these viruses, so in actuality it's making them less dangerous. And while certain types of viruses can spread very quickly, they really don't have the level of danger associated with them that other bioweapons do: spreading pneumonic plague or anthrax (both bacteria) is just as easy and much more targeted; weaponizing a pandemic would only really be possible if you already had a vaccine, and if you did, it means it's not that hard to create one, and even then, a single mutated strain could screw everything up.  Viruses love to mutate, and generally they mutate to be more infectious and less pathogenic (viruses want to spread and survive, killing their host isn't the goal, which is why so many deadly viruses have come from animals, we aren't the species they are used to). these viruses will always be basically uncontrollable, and we know so little about their actual inner workings right now that figuring it out poses way more benefits than risks, such as finding new antiviral drugs.
Hi do you have infographics in spanish and for kids?
I'm sorry, I really love this channel, but I'm losing respect for it the more you talk about COVID as if it was not a planned event meant to depopulate, destabilize, polarize, and ushering the greatest wealth transfer in human history. Anyone paying any attention at all knows it was a pLandemic.  Please cover it truthfully
Yeah covid was easy to breakdown since it was released by the same people
Uh. I like this channel a lot, but, I'm slightly concerned by the comment that the lab leak hypothesis is still being taken seriously. I know this is a science channel and not a politics channel, but that comment gave me the same kinda sketchy vibes that I now associate with Sabine Hossenfelder. I recall that recently, another science channel, Rebecca Watson, mentioned how there was a whole panel of virologists out there basically saying, "there are all these genetic markers in all of these strains, and, if the lab leak hypothesis were true then we would expect to see these markers disappear from newer strains as they evolve, but we don't see that", and so.. uh... IS it up for debate anymore? I genuinely thought it was not.
8:07 - "We need to get better at getting new vaccines faster than ever before" - no thank you, bullshit-19 was more than enough to demonstrate that this must not be repeated.
This is the first time I've heard a medium outside of SCP use the term "infohazard" and I'm delighted to see the term is catching on in mainstream media.
Should really not spread controversy about coronavirus origin
this entire video is just fearmongering about a made-up problem and saying the only solution is to sanction and privatise an entire industry and track and surveil anyone pursuing it
Covid is from a lab. Covid will gave brain fogs and weaken your immunity over time.even after catching it
Who are these pesky scientists saving the world as if the world is worth saving?
we love you. nothing to be ashamed of or cringe at, its all a process! live and learn! thank you for doing your part and bringing us amazing information within every video!
Even a platform like this one that started from curiosity and genuine info came to that conclusion. The "people" in control have their hands everywhere and they make it hard for us to find out legit info. Shame on kurzgesagt they're letting us down
Hey Ferb, I know what we’re gonna do today!
I'm so huge fan of Kurzgesagt that I have a profile pic related to them, lol. ❤️
it came from a lab.
this is the Division (a game) plot in that game a someone created a virus and their plan allowed it to spread super fast, destroying the US and maybe even the world
Crazy video, thank you!!!
Covid came from the Wuhan Lab ..  The Most Dangerous Weapon is  a Vaccine what making some people sick  slowly time to time..
Why do I feel like we're all being primed up for *another* pandemic, so the governments of the world can get their *unlimited absolute power FIX ?*
Regarding your posters, what are the chances you make them in spanish as well? I'd love to buy them, I would understand them also, but in my familiy only I speak english.
The power of the cell in the palm of my hand

4:46 "New Batsh*t virus discovered"
lets close pandora's box.... forever.
LOL 4:45 Sneaky :P
This should be off the internet. Informing people how to createt a bio weapon basically. You are not following the 3 bullet points.
❤
Yeah getting rid of testing such a great idea...
What a time to be alive
Okay this is a bit of a bigger issue: presenting UVC lamps as safe to run while people are in a room and the voiceover saying they kill the viruses you breathe before someone else can inhale them. That’s dangerous considering people are already giving themselves awful burns and even skin cancer with UVC lamps.   Ventilation and filtration is an excellent idea, but putting it alongside the UVC lamps might make people who know a little about the latter distrustful of the former.
Love the Resident Evil reference!
dogs are not real! cats are real, dogs are fake...
Time to send this to the United Kingdom.
I can already hear people shouting, "It's my right to have easy access to a weapon that can kill!!"
We actually have known where C19 came from for years now.😂 Wasn😢the Gates Foundation funding both this channel and the Wuhan Lab Sars Cov Classic research?
Well….  This is comforting.
You never hide information from bad people, you just hide it from common citizens, bad people will pay the price and still have access to them, no matter what and I don't think it's fair compare nuclear to biology, one has very little potential for profit, the other is literally a gold mine, adding a wall to access this information is just protect the interest of the "Big Pharma". I expected more from you guys...
The animators made a small mistake putting the iPod in 1995 :P I get you wanted it to change each time, but I think going from Walkman in 90, to Discman in 95, to iPod in 02 would’ve been better. Just a tiny nerd nitpick!
AI technology is also one of the most dangerous weapon.
Soon enough, vaccines are no longer gonna cut it. Not to mention the amount and obsolescence, unless we start editing our own bodies to be more resistant, we just speeding towards our own doom.
I mean if we're being PEDANTIC about it, you could say the most dangerous weapon IS Nuclear, just... talking about a Cellular Nucleus, affected by the RNA payload of a viral particle.
really? Kurzgesagt is promoting censoring knowledge? today is a sad day.................  there is no person, not group, which has the right to deceide what other individuals, or groups, are worthy of knowing certain information. Censorship and gatekeeping information, is far more dangerous to humanity than any negative out come of unrestricted knowledge....... You only have to control information, if youre trying to control the narrative of the world. Censorship for safety is an excuse, not a logical reason.
how is everyones 12023 going?
Kurzgesagt advocating for tracking….. fantastic.
Has none of these scientists watched breakout
The difference is you can't stop a nuclear blast with a millimeter of plastic and a mask
And this is exactly why Jurassic Park exists
"Imagine that repair shops can build an iPhone..." Sorry, i lost you here. Apple doesn't even allow repair shops to fix their phones, forget about building one.
7:26
What.... Where's the intro? Where's the monkey holding things? IS THE MONKEY OK!???
What’s up with the fear mongering in this one? 🤦🏻‍♂️
Pretty much any time we use new tech to try to maximize profits in a capitalist money, your going down the “use it for bad” path.  Because capitalism only cares about maximally profitable results, not controlling for maximally beneficially results.
Always with the "this technology is an existential risk, but we'll be able to do so many great things with it!" Like what? Seriously, just tell me one single thing I, a regular healthy person, should be excited about, that's not some bullshit like CURE DEATH or fix a problem caused by another technology. It's all turning into one big liability circlejerk, where the primary purpose of each new technology is to protect us against the existential threats that the others pose. All we get right now is a constant stream of threats we have to face up to from AI, hypersonic missiles, DNA tampering etc. Your life will not be better. It's just one more horror in the world.
Good excuse for the governments to put you away forever
Oh gee. I wonder how they were able to know the structure of coronavirus so fast. It’s almost as if it was human created to begin with…….
I am a biomedicine student in Brazil and in the future I intend to start working in laboratories located near the Amazon region, where the greatest biodiversity in the world exists, to better study and control possible pandemics that may arise. There is still a lot of work to be done but both I and other scientists here are optimistic that in a few decades fantastic solutions will emerge for the world.
Ferb, I know what we’re gonna do today!
Hahahhaa the umbrella corp logo!
I would put a dent on that logic. What the pandemic taught us was thatbig pharma would rather see a pandemic last forever and people enslaved by a absolute need to be vaccinated, than not. What that means is, they will not allow for tech that could prevent them from selling billions of vaccine doses to exist on the market. At the very least, such tech will be way too expensive, and the very lucrative business of mandatory vaccination will remain strategy number 1
Knowledgge should never be limited
There is no way I'll ever believe that COVID was responsible for over 7,000,000 deaths.  That number is a lie.  That number was produced by counting all the people that died, who tested positive for COVID.  Not people that died from COVID.  If someone was shot in the chest and died from blood loss, they checked that blood to see if it had COVID.  If it did, then it was written as death by COVID.  That's not to mention that those COVID tests were waaaaay to sensitive.
"unknown covid virus" you mean the one they MADE in wuhan?
"Really expensive things got cheap" *Ah yes, because things are cheap now*
But if you just leave it all alone, eventually people will be able to make working vaccines in their garages as well.
This video reminds me of dr amherst from the division...
Amazing posters!!! Let's hope that Midjourney gets trained on them.
Hey Ferb      *I know what we’re gonna do today*
So... zombie apocalypse 2024?
If in the wrong hands or if the military decides to weaponize biotechnology, we'd have Resident Evil in real life.
wuhan lab leak is now confirmed.
What the hell is a migraine please explain that
propaganda, I agree with this chanel alot but on this specific point, no that is not the right way to limit the dangerous capablilities of potentail biowepons
It is still up to debate? Did tracking its spread back to the market nearest a poorly run chinese bio lab with a history of lab leaks, A veritable biotechnic chernoble not prove things?
I've learned so much from this video! now I feel you're giving ideas to terrorists and military around the world
3:15 you'd get swatted immediately  And reported by the smart devices all around your home
“What if you could build a nuclear bomb in your backyard?” good way to start a segment lol
The over simplification that this channel has ended up at is terrible. With sadness, unsubscribed.
I mean scientists in the field have been begging for regulatory legislation for decades now, unfortunately the government is comprised of senile curmudgeons who can only work 4 hours a day before nappy time
2:40 that's my dream world right there.
also kind of getting the vibe that your stating that only corporate entities should have access to this tech, look at the saga with forever chemicals, look at the resent case with Glyphosate, look at the general landscape that large mega corporations make around them and the lack of accountability they always have, why should i trust them with biomedical advances
As abiology researcher, its the first time Kurzgesagt disapoint me with how partisan and innacurate some of the information in this video were. Yes we know for sure the Covid virus came out of a lab. We also know for sure now (thanks to the pfizer trial files) that the "vaccine" (which isnt really a vaccine per say), Was not tested in a proper controlled and reviewed placebo trial. We also know for sure, thanks to the same files, that no only that vaccine was not tested properly, but also caused more harm than it did good. To understand that, one would just need to look at the NNH and NNT numbers for the pfzer vaccine.   So to me it is suprising that a channel that puts out such a large amounbt of genuin good quality content can make mistake as big as that. I know most people arent educated enought to understand how badly they got lied to during covid about "science" and medecine, but I feel like its you guys job to educate people. Please dont take the side of megacorp, and tell the truth to people.
step 1 isolate the bacteria. step 2 train a phage that attack that specific bacteria step 3 spread immunity (: step 4. no profit pls
from educational videos to scare mongering paid by others. nothing good lasts forever I guess
So, today all it takes to become a die hard or mission impossible villain is having a google account??? We used to see these people in movies because they were not realistic enough to exist irl.
I can't believe you made a video about how the solution is MORE SURVEILLANCE, after your government just used one of these tailor made viruses as a weapon. The solution to that is called gallows.
2:41 Okay but something about hearing Papa Kurz say that sentence just makes me laugh 😄
Fbi: So. About your browser history..
I see the restricting and tracking of Viral Data to be as futile as restricting and tracking the Anarchist's cookbook. The genie is out of the bottle already and short of authoritarian tracking I don't see any way of restricting this.
NO, you are not pushing virus misinformation, COVID was not created in a lab there is no evidence to support that and plenty of genetic similarity to strains existing in bats
Thank you for being a force for good in the world :>
Cool so can i have a sandevistan soon?
0:50 I can’t believe you still promote the scamdemic, which was very clearly completely doctored. How many billions did people like Bill Gates make from investing into big pharma before 2019?
And to think I was about to buy a new car. Silly me
Another way looking at the possibility of a deadly virus that wipes out 95% of the population and sends us back to a pre-industrialisation stage, is that it's perfect for solving the problem of climate change. The underlying cause of climate change is that there's just too damned many of us: 8 billion all wanting food, phones, cars, houses, computers and foreign holidays is unsustainable, too many for the planet's limited resources. Bring on the virus - let's have a planetary reset!
Please don't do this.
Durka durka, Mohammad Jihad!!! 🫠
The idea of localized virus detectors that sort of do a quality check for the air and water all across the world and maybe shares the info it collects with a network, that sounds incredibly useful and powerful. As the technology becomes cheaper and cheaper, we might see one day that sequencing viruses is so mundane that it can be done for next to nothing in a matter of minutes, allowing us to monitor these things in real time and eliminate virtually all air/waterborne viruses.
Terrorists may cause a pandemic sooner than they cause a nuclear explosion.
Love your merch and love the content you create. Love you people.
Yeah, not a fan of restriction of information
This man taught me stuff in less than an hour better than a high school could in a year
Um, I’m really starting to think Covid was a test run for China, to see if they could protect enough of their own people, while decimating the rest when they release something worse. I don’t have a tinfoil hat emoji or I would end my comment with it.
Diabetes being somehow treatable on the insulin production level would be a night/day difference by itself. It strongly lends to nihilistic contemplation, being a risk to both the person and cherished ones.
I love how kurzgesagt says 'just let authorities deal with it' to literally any issue featuring in the video. First and for most there are like 70/200+ countries with gdp higher than a certain point and all the other ones are just horrendously poor so their governments wouldn't care less about some bio hazard info leakage countermeasures. Secondly some rich countries wouldn't care less too just because. I mean look at Russia they are doing complete bs in their borders as much as outside of them no cap. So if we will all die by 2025 'cause of bio attack from some Bangladesh psycho that would be totally expected. :)
BIOTECH... IS GODZILLA! \m/
I love your posters! I was wondering, as a soon to be speech therapist, if you could do a video about the human voice? And maybe having a great poster for it 😄 I love this channel so much and it is one of the few, I watch every video Thank you for the effort put in all of them!
Bro, you literally described the genetic ascension from stellaris
Wait… but I WANNA PROFIT ON THAT
Bad video. calling for a more police state that surveils everyone is not going to solve anything, and in fact, it's the government that weaponizes bio-tech,  no civilians have bio-warfare departments that sucks billions every year.
this video is going to be a hit
Thank you Kurzgesagt for spreading the good word and educating us social media obsessed people.
huh, there is no intro
Matthew 13:18-23 18 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. 20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. 22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
I...hmm. So this is up to your standard quality of work but, I feel, it is also itself a serious infohazard. That is, by watching it, I now know that my best bet to cause mass death is to make my own virus, and have a pretty solid starting path to doing so. This video has 800k views as of 7 hours. The odds of a would-be mass killer being among that 800k is low, but it's not negligible, and it's rising by the minute. Of course, the odds of a dunning-kruger addled buffoon who assumes following "I fucking love science" means they're qualified to safely contain a supervirus in their basement watching Kurzgesagt is, I suspect, much higher.  If there is the possibility of people being able to make deadly superviruses in their house for a few thousand dollars and a subscription to medical journals, probably the most important way to mitigate that risk is to not publish a video, to an audience of 21 million people , informing them that you can make deadly superviruses in their house for a few thousand dollars and a subscription to medical journals.  Edit: Luckily, it seems that the threat is overstated in the video, based on other comments, but still. If the threat posed in the video were real, releasing this video would have a been a borderline criminally irresponsible thing to do.
I’ve been a fan for a couple years, and I plan on buying some posters soon :D I love the content sm
Much love to the Kurzgesagt team ❤
what did he say 7:25
“The next step is detecting the danger by becoming aware which viruses are present among us” Sussy part here 7:25
I feel like if watching kurzgesagt videos was mandatory, flat earthers, anti vaxxers, people who dont believe in climate change, etc. wouldnt exist.
Also, please bring back the INTRO! I love it so much!
I feel like were very close to some random breakthrough in science
humans shouldnt play God.
Dear Kurzgesagt, i was wondering if 1, you could see this comment, and 2, listen to this. I feel like when it comes to the immune system, you only talk about virus’s, bacteria, and VERY little about parasites. So, if you could make a few video’s about parasitic AND fungal infections, that would be wonderful!
Imagine a leak from a biotech factory... 😰
As cmon, just a little bit of biological warfare please?
Isn't almost everything that was said about the risks applicable to AI as well? Except AI is even more dangerous because it can help make pathogens or make them itself?...
nice War on DNA propeganda
If you think bio-technology is controllable, now try to explain how the globe would police AI tech   We shouldn't have made these things in the first place, we were not ready. Now we're fucked. Theres no putting the cat back into the bag, Pandora's Box has been opened and it cannot be closed. Best we can hope at this point is that when a disaster does happen, it doesn't wipe out all of humanity so we can rebuild and hopefully learn from our extreme levels of arrogance and not let profits be the sole drivers of technology. Theres no profit incentive to build things safer, and those who try will simply be out competed and bought out by those who don't care about the risks.
May want to talk to China about these steps…
Wow, this is the quickest release yet! Even faster than the “civilisation drop”!
First off… this video could kill us all, I bet no one knew about this until it was brought up….
7:26
6:45 yeahhhh of course… we will say that…
Do me one favor, don't listen to the 1% of negative comments.  99% are positive and you know why?  Because you guys rock.
2:49 Funny you mention that. I did some biology course some year ago. we're totally out of the loop here in france.
Keep up the good work spreading a message of peace, patience, wisdom, and love.
It was a lab leak obviously....
"infohazard", track people for posting information? who decides who the wrong people are? this is by far the most propaganda like video you guys have madee
I think the solution is quite simple, really. Just engineer your own deadly supervirus to wipe out everyone so that they can’t engineer a deadly supervirus
Yes citizen You should not be allowed to know without approval. You should not be allowed to experiment without a license. We are the ones that know. We are the ones that keep you safe.  We have the chance to have a future where we get to truly control biology. Your biology.
Man i really can't stand kurzgesagt saying among us 💀
A worthless vaccine !  It doesn't prevent anything
This is exactly where I knew this channel was headed. <3 Thank you for taking humanity seriously! <3
I'm really disappointed that you are now at a point where you present racially-motivated conspiracy theories, like the one that the coronavirus is from a lab in wuhan, as being "scientifically debated". Kurzgesagt used to be a decent source of information and it really is disappointing to see you stoop so low as to propagate political hoaxes like that.
This reminds me of the Netflix series sweet tooth
Yeah, anyone who is recorded to have this sort of information should be legally required to sign away their right to privacy. And anyone who doesn't agree or understand that should be banned from such information.
Ah yes, the pug. Science’s greatest achievement.
Luckily the AIs are impervious to biological viruses, so after we wipe ourselves out something intelligent will remain. Unless of course they release their own techno pandemic
Glad to see Kurzgesagt posting about our criminal negligence. Lookin' at you, gain of function!
Wheres the intro :(
Glad I was lacking in an existential crisis and Kurzgesagt helped me out
You spoke about gene therapy then the covid "vaccine" within 15 seconds of each other? Surely the covid vaccine was also gene therapy no?
Given how 2019 went I'm pretty sure humanity isn't capable of avoiding a catastrophic pandemic when there are so many people eager and devoted to the spreading of said pandemic at any cost because apparently safety measures and saving lives are "sissy liberal ideas".
Naturally occurring or engineered pandemic, our real downfall will be anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers. They will be the primary plague vectors in the future.
We are decades away from the point when someone can spend 1 year salary to send a device to kill any one person or group of people they want. We have a choice to either work on mental health or do the politically advantageous thing by doubling down on the observation, control, and the stripping of rights of every person more and more each decade as the methods become more and more varied the individual with one year's salary could cause mass harm. Here in the US the people in power get more votes by doing the latter, and wide spread effort on the first would quickly deflate favored narratives. I feel this will all end quite bleak for my country. With a good microscope and a population of animals to work with, people could already breed out mutations in bird flu as a pet project to kill millions if they wanted in a handful of years. They just don't. If they did, what would be the next level of policing? Some amount of the 4th amendment barely survives after what congress and the Supreme Court did uncontested during the Obama years, but how much longer?
Good umbrella corp reference
I'm guessing I'm not the only one who heard this news and thought 'maybe I should do some of that research at home'?
More likely each nation, most of which revolve around 1 race, will be working on bioweapons designed to wipe out everyone but their own 'pure' version of their race. And yes, that is what most nations revolve around: A single ethnic monolith.
We still don't know if it was from the nature or leaked from a lab working on corona virus?  We still don't know?  All these sophisticated channel with all these colorful animations and deep research doesn't know ? Unsub...
3:40 Leak from a lab? Conspiratorial much?
Be cautious trusting Kurzgesagt. He gets his money from Bill Gates Foundation, well known to trade a lot of Big Pharma stock during the pandemic. So sad to see the channel pushing the billionaire propaganda
Ok, I stopped at sars-v2 vaccine. That was a huge lie, we all know that was created in Wuhan lab and released on purpose to sell the "vaccines" later, which were planned in advance (and skipping clinical trials). Please don't insult our intelligence, thank you
I m never taking a gene therapy vaccine ever again!
How do you report a video?
We'll probobably die because people on facebook and twitter will complain about vaccines
Special Biological Operation.
Its obvious the Wuhan virus came from a lab.  The arguments against it are not "scientific".  They are political.  If someone says it did not come from a lab, they are a leftist. You forgot the genetic markers showing un natural tampering.  The virus was used as a political tool to opreds poor people and conservatives.  You can go "protest" with thousands, loot and burn but you cant go to church for an hour.
THIS VIDEO IS SPONSORED BY OPEN PHILANTHROPY (Bill Gates)
All I have to say is that locking information about these pathogens that can potentially and very improbably be used for malicious purposes is not a good idea.
Honestly, just wipe us out already. I'm tired.
Homebrew viruses... Yay...
Except the vaccine caused long term issues
Oh no 7:26
No title screen? Made me thought I lost my mind
You should do a video on cybernetics!
Amazing content as always
"What if you could build a nuclear bomb in your backyard?" What if indeed...
Your suggestions for enhancing detection sound reasonable but as for controlling public access to scientific journals and the like... I would have thought the sheer volume of absolute fairy tales everyone on both side of the political spectrum have spun over the pandemic would have been enough of an argument for more scientific literacy, not less.  Apparently not.  Apparently even a relatively smart science education channel can still be a little stupid.  Your argument for curtailing public access to scientific information sounds similar to a short bit of drama the US magazine Popular Mechanics got into about twenty years ago.  Shortly after 9/11, Popular Mechanics published an article explaining exactly how some common household object could mess up the inner workings of a plane (think it was a mercury thermometer or something.)  The following issue had dozens of letters from people thinking it was absolutely irresponsible that they did that because terrorists might be reading it.  The issue after that one, Popular Mechanics published a letter they got from the FBI that basically read "hey we read this magazine too and we loved that article."  Moral of that story:  Free access to information for everyone means free access for EVERYONE.  Not just people we should be scared of.
Lab leak "theory" hahaha. That chinese money sure makes people spurt disinfo.
Thank you for doing the best you can to create videos with accurate information.
7:25 among us
Remember when you were labeled a right wing nutcase hatemonger for suggesting even the slight chance maybe covid possibly came from a lab? hehehe
Can you guys make a video on Unbiological life?
They never isolated the corona virus. This is spreading misinformation
7:25 wait... Did he really said... Impossible!
Looking at the American political climate... I don't have much faith that the politicians will do the right thing.
fearmongering is based, keep up the good work
If the people giving me vaccines act like the scp foundation I ain't taking it
This is worrisome.  However, its unlikely nation states would deliberately release genetically modified super-diseases intentionally because the possibility of "blow back" is basically 100%.  However, that still leaves the door wide open for unintentional accidental releases and by rogue groups.  A dooms-day religious cult that has one or more deranged expert scientists leading it could be such a rogue group.
If tailormade bioweapons won't wipe out humanity, then AGI will.
3:35 we know exacly from where come out... and your video show how easy is to build bioweapons in today day... and this wont be the lastt one
Virtually every single major disaster was directly caused by one or multiple governments. Better fearmonger about lone wolves.
No worries, USS Alpha Team will securely seize all samples at NEST soon, and we will all be safe from T & Golgotha!
Shouldnt have talked bout the vaxine bro,,,,bill gates chanell
Sad seeing this channel going woke, trying so hard to meet "Modern Audiences" expectations (which no matter what is done, will never be achieved).  Get back to space stuff and leave controversial, politically driven topics aside. That is unless you want to go broke.
Tired of these AI generated science videos
5:59 What can I do? You gave scientists the ideas, but it's not possible one will watch it while looking for anything. I'm open to your ideas
Love what you guys do on this channel
I really love the easter eggs of resident evil and jurassic park 😍♥
yea, everything get's cheaper to do. Yet somehow everyone wants more money for the same thing
Ooooo ooooooo now do one on how everyone who downloads a coding LLM should also be endlessly tracked and intrusively monitored by the government lol
We didn't handle nuclear at all. We killed it and all innovation that it could've brought. We have laughable amount of nuclear, primarily because everyone is afraid of the bomb.
Still waiting for the ability to create my own body. This gives hope for that. One can wish at least.
1:20 That computer definitely looks more 1989 than 1999
4:46 "NEW *BATSHIT* VIRUS DISCOVERED"
Yes the virus was sequenced and it was found to have been man made. The sequence is not a natural one. Don't believe me, Check for yourself. Then I can tell you near me 3 mobile cv test places, showed 100% positives. Nothing is 100%. X3 ? Ask where are the flu numbers? Hmmm no flu all covid? Come on man!
We know it came from a lab...dont have to feign ignorance.
It's not a vaccine. Stop calling the COVID 19 shots by Pfizer moderna and every other company a vaccine it is not.
Mankind can't control everything
I wouldn’t take this video at face value, I’d take it with a huge grain of salt. Advocating for less open sharing among scientists and more surveillance than already exists in the world makes me doubt that this video is sincere about fears of bio warfare rather than the desire of some people to control the spread of knowledge and keep it in the hands of a few to maintain existing power structures. Exactly like with nuclear weapons and nuclear energy, which are almost exclusively in the hands of powerful and often colonial countries that use them to maintain their hegemony.
Where do you buy genetic samples like how
What excites me most about this hypothetical future in which we have a good grip on biology is that it will most likely be within my lifetime.
So u only want the billionaires that are funding this channel to access biotechnology data? What a bad take
e
Ok kids... dont try what you saw in the video about UV lights in bedroom. The UV you need, to do what its suggesting would be UV-C, that gives you Cancer really fast. Its very energetic stuff
Still pretending lab leak is "up for debate." I remember when it was a "dangerous conspiracy theory." I wonder if our government, which indirectly funded the Wuhan lab via NGOs, would have any incentive to cover up the origin of covid...
Bro i clicked on this and got an ad and it somehow knew that i was watching kurzgesagt
Good luck planet earth
I FREAKIN LOVE SCIENCE. THANKS BILL GATES AND THE FOUNDATION. I WILL TAKE THE DRUGS. PRAISE BIG PHARMA
oh wow! i didn't know how cheap and easy making a dangerous virus was! thanks kurzgesagt!
Vaccines proved to be tested before virus even began,ask pfizer
scaremongering..  inaccurate about how dangerous viruses can be accessed by the public..  pure lies..  anyone who tries to dabble with biohazards will find themselves on a list very quickly..
3:52 love the Umbrella reverence
International treaties on limitation and voluntary disarmament do not work.  As an example of Russia and its violation of the Budapest Memorandum.
I got a ad and the dude in the ad told me i was watching a kurzgesagt video ; - ;
The Division lore
Right evil dark powers are evil
Keep being awesome Kurzgesagt
I think you oversimplified in this video, which was disappointing as you're very much on point in everything else you make. I do not think the call for regulation that you make here is necessarily the only solution. I don't think the comparison to nuclear weapons quite works; it's a bit apples to oranges. Not to mention a slightly click-baity title. Lots of good points nevertheless, but c'mon.
Scary! thank you for the great work you guys at Kurzgesagt do!
Man this channel is becoming more and more profit biased every day
4:46 first kurzgesagt video with on-screen swearing, this is the terrifying future of the channel
nice
we should get rid off free market and embrace a planned economy
They knew the sequences of Covid because they created it. Not because our technology is getting better, although it is. The more these videos get funded by big money the more you start to see a narrative.  Then they state how information need to be controlled. While i agree not everything is for everybody, they fail to state that we should get to the bottom about how covid happened.
lmaoo "Food crops resistant to climate change" That's a *_REALLY_* weird way to say pretending to do bullshit that won't actually work because nothing can live without water. Period. They can't beat The Blight and they've been trying for a hundred years now. They will *_LITERALLY_* never beat climate change.
7:26 AMONG US
You can't safely use UV lamps at home, they decompose synthetic and organic materials alike, producing often toxic or allergenic compounds. There's a solid reason these are used in hospitals and other strictly controlled environments only.  And air cleaner has little to do with your epidemiological safety, either. Most points of contact are in public transportation or other human activity hubs like workplaces and restaurants, not in your house.
It's a good day when Kurzgersagart uploads ☺
Cant wait for the zombie apocolyps
You Missed your Intro and your pigeons s
Thanks for making me realize that I can finally kill all humanity from my backyard!
Sponsored by the Gates foundation and WEF
i wish for a video about agi alignment
The animationsnare stunning. Quality not quantity.
3:40 I don't know how long it takes to make a video, but "lab leak theory" has since been exposed and accepted as a fact.  It DID come from the Wuhan Lab.  Denying this fact now has the credibility of claiming the earth is flat or that CNN is the most trusted name in news.
Nuclear warfare: Destroying nature making it inhabitable.  Bio warfare: Destroying humans.
Every time I watch your videos my hope for a better future is revived thanks for your hard work
Now I can imagine how aliens microbes wouldn’t be a threat. Maybe every species succeed in eradicating pandemics quickly enough and adapt before space travel. That would mean safe contact between species.
Oh no.
You know the kurzgesargt episode is serious when they use humans instead of birbs.
As you say bio technology is exploding. We need more episodes on this with current break throughs in detailed fields and future practical uses, please please.
There are people who genuinely wan to exterminate humanity to "protect nature".
yay Kurzgesagt! your the best.
If only but, if we dont share we dont progress, humans are by and large, evil most of the time, ESPECIALLY those with power.   I want us to move forward in a healthy better way, but we know that wont happen. Money is involved and favors from one big shot to another will kill us. Love seeing the progress though.
F
I mean if you have bio labs working to create weapons against Slavs, than yes that is illegal and horrible.
I think it’s funny that the video tries to classify biotechnology into categories like super naughty DNA and “good“ DNA.  Our entire existence depends on a complex ecosystem, and while some pieces of it could potentially be modified and we could still survive, it only takes one virus or bacteria or organism that upsets the balance in the wrong way for us to careen off course.  Sometimes it is the small things that we are dependent on that get overlooked that can ultimately bring us down.
cant belive they hid the nazi flag at 2:19
These biolabs doing experiments (kike yhe one from china with covid research) should be closed... there is fundamental difference between nuclear and bio weapons... radiation does nor replicate and does not mutate - once you are protected thats it, but not so with bio weapons...
“We still don’t know if it came from a lab or not.” Yes. Yes we do.
Open Philantropy, ey? 3:33 So that's why you say such things. 8:07 Yeah, new *patented* vaccines that are made with taxpayer money but you still have to buy them. 8:29 Will _we_ control our biology or just a few companies? 9:09 Nah, when The Hated One exposed you, that was way more embarrassing.
First Kurzgesagt video I've fundamentally disagreed with - information should never be restricted. Deal with the societal reasons why people might want to cause harm.
This all brings back memories of the Lower Decks when they're cleaning out illegal experiments being performed by crew members.
What is this feeling? I'm not overwhelmed with existential dread. Is this... optimism?
Nice video again^^
the pug lmao
on what First World/Sweatshop country they have high schoolers build iPhones as homework?!
6:26 pretty sure that a lot of warheads have just straight up been lost in the past or ended up at the ocean floor
4:45 *NEW BATSHIT VIRUS DISCOVERED* no pun intended i hope
...Okay, just for sure, can we reverse engineering Monsanto stuff at home labs? 🤫🤫😉😉
"Viral of Medical Journology" 😅
oh look another doom & gloom video..... yay....
7:26 they said it ඞ
With so much negative news going around at all times, I always get a little emotional watching a Kurzgesagt video. Its refreshing to see optimistic takes on what will happen in the future. Thank you for all your work.
Sadly, Covid isn't over yet. I really hope that Biotechnology can help us cure Long Covid, Post Vax and ME/CFS.
Do a video on Termites!   Also love the fact you make learning fun.  You deserve the attention you get.
It's actually nearly impossible to get *accurate* DNA sequencing by yourself in a personal house setting. You will instead get a kit from the companies that do that, who outsource it to biolabs that take the sample and put them into the machines to do it. The reason cost is low is because those machines are now well automated, and the law of scale. You are still hardly doing yourself by on your own unless you are buying millions of dollars of equipment that only big hospitals and universities can afford.
I mean this script kind of already playing out....
”What if you could build a nuclear bomb in your backyard” its going to the out of context compilations i can see it 😂
Where is the black hole channel id intro? 😢
AMONG US
Good video! But I don't think the pandemic is anywhere close to an end
3:48 if you know you know
How the fuck is this video even possibly be uploaded on youtube
Just gotta say, it's frustrating that you don't address capitalism more.  None of this discusses the effects it has on health care and the spread of disease.  Just look at what happened in the US from COVID.  Like 80% of our deaths could have been prevented from stopping capitalism's death march.  You also don't address it in your climate change videos.  It just makes you feel toothless and like you're not willing to tell the truth about a lot of these situations.  Shame on you.  Do better
Would love to see your videos in 4K! I know there's only a few of us, but I love saving these videos to watch on TV, but they hardly look better than something rushed like the Infographic Show on it.
Corona only counts when they dont want u to be there.
the f was that ad before the video about
Ok so who saw the AD while watching this video
'12 Monkeys' spoiler alert 😅
As much as I like the accurancy of Kurtzgesagt videos this one I cannot agree with... Yes, it is possible to create novel virus that is much much more easy to spread or kill its subject, but realization of such project is extremly difficult.  First, to know your virus truly is "better" you need to test it... on subjects of interest... and if we mean humans it is difficult to find many individuals to test your virus on. Keeping control on your experiment while keeping it in secret... doesnt seem easy with how much information is monitored today. Second, artificially adding "better" genes into a virus to make it deadlier is again, difficult. You are more likely to kill a virus than making it stronger using this method. Its much easier to just let nature do this work for you and use some controlled environment to let your virus spread and evolve, forcing natural selection to be deadlier and easier to spread... but eventually, if you let this virus out it will probably evolve back into a form that does not kill its host as this strategy is non optimal. The most optimal solution would be (just like with any other pandemic virus in history) to make itself easier to spread but also less deadly. Viruses are constantly evolving and yours will too, its not something that will stay the same throughout a pandemic. Third, you can have easy acces to dangerous information but if you cant understand what to do with it it is not a useful information and to be able to create a deadly virus you will need some experties within the field. Fourth, you wont be able to create such virus in short time. It could be decades till you find your perfect killer. Till then your target population might change/evolve/adapt and with it your virus wont be that much effective anymore.  It seems to me it is much easier to create a bomb and use it than creating a virus that might work.
it was hard a lab leak
Fingers crossed we crack immortality.
7:26 HE SAID AMONG US    Also he should make a video about AI
lmao and also remember when alot of ppl were saying they wouldnt get the vaccine bc trump was behind it and it was rushed
corona was mayby unknown to west but chinese knew it very well
Legalize nuclear bobs just became too real...
Censorship is hardly going to help anyone. Current limitations to the information, such as paywalls behind many journals, are already causing severe damage to the technological capabilities of many regions. We need to have a strong etics formation, and stop treating wildlife as a source of dangerous things. Protecting biodiversity and keeping healthy environments is another way to prevent future pandemics, even more effective than mechanical filters, uv light or hiding information about anything.
Yes yes🎉🎉🎉🤩 One of my favorite channels.🎉🎉
6 hours late
Keep cookin that propaganda.
I worked at a repair shop. We literally can build you an Iphone 11 with the stuff in the store.
What really icks me is when the worlds greatests doctors, scientists and scholars scramble to make a vaccine in just a few months in danger and then brainless nobodies tell you it's just a conspiracy..
I would have appreciated more detail on what the real magnitude of the risk is here. We live in a time when a lot of people are massively over-hyping these so-called “existential risks”, and from what I understand of the field, individual biohackers cooking up deadly plagues is still the stuff of science fiction and it would be way easier and cheaper for terrorists to just use nerve gas. Not that we shouldn’t worry at all, and who knows where we’ll be in 30 years, but we have a lot of problems in the world today and concerning ourselves too much with some of this stuff (like runaway AI) just seems like fearmongering. I think basic pandemic preparedness, which apparently we’re still not doing, would be a much bigger win and we’d get a lot of these things “for free”.
Hey kurzgesasagt and guys I saw a historic inaccuracie in this beautiful animation  .during the human genome project scene , I saw that the scientist had an iPod in 1997, well the iPod was released in 2001 not the late 90s
i took 2 biotech classes in hs and it was pretty fun and not too difficult
This video demonstrates exactly why genetic modification of crops is not simply a benign and benevolent endeavor with no side effects whatsoever.  We have groups that want to save every last species, while simultaneously believing in survival of the fittest, while simultaneously thinking that we should modify nature itself at its most base level in order to get what we want out of it, including things like mice or bacteria that produce insulin or cross breeding various animals with human DNA.  Logically, it’s just a bunch of contradictory and incompatible beliefs. Science is a fantastic tool, but human beings are not known for understanding risks and for understanding the consequences of our actions. Tinkering with technology that is at the very heart of our survival is incredibly dangerous and should be treated as such, not simply made into something that is so cavalierly and casually adopted.
Great video + nice easter egg...umbrella corp logo hidden in the video 👍
WOO!!!!! humans are cool!!
or another ant video
As a Molecular Biologist and MD, very simplistic video, barely worth watching and glosses over many controversies.  I assume that this was written for Junior High school students, worthless and somewhat misleading for a smart educated adult or High school student.
Emperor Xi gave us all co-vid. CCP is far more dangerous then some random person could be. If you are American or ally of America then you should Treat communist China like you are Already at war.
kurzgesagat please can you make an video about lasius niger ants one of the most common ants.
I really don't like how casually they said the next pandemic very well might be our own fault
I really didn't get the iphone analogy
Best channel in YouTube by a mile. Thank you for all your work.
The uv idea: Wouldn't that also be harmful for the patient over time?
So the 1988 Blob movie is soon to be real?  Uh oh.
We don‘t need GMO‘s to reduce climatechange. We really don‘t need them. What is the interrest of Kurzgesagt? Are there some bonds to the food or GMO lobby? I realised that you guys often try to manipulate the viewers in favour to GMO‘s or fastfood.
Nobody even managed to make a truly efficient covid vaccine without harrowing side effects because everything has to be profit driven and rushed, who are you kidding bruh😂 gtfoh
Few hours ago, there was a fly connectom successfully simulated on computer. Few years ago there was only C.elegans livin on the computer, and this is literally so breathtaking.  we are now so really and nearly seeing the entering of rapid changing.  we have to welcome the change. not aware. it's not the way how we treat the natural thing. Change is 'natural' and don't percepting it's own value, just awaring from distance, is something that shouldn't pursued for which is thing that rule and omnipresentic.
Careful kurzgesagt. If you mention the theory where the sick thing came from accidents in scientific experiments, you'll get censored.
This threat is the scernario of the movie "12 monkeys".
ah yes please do not mention that private pharma companies have made billions in profit during the pendemic off innovation that has been funded by public ressources. please do not mention that such crisis have been caused by capitalistic accumulation and expansion motives and then profit off the exact same crisis. please don't...
People can avoid spreading virtually any pathogen by simply not getting in contact with each other.
where human faces
These guys are dodgy and just be taken with a pinch of salt 💯
I have a better idea. Lets destroy this planet altogether so there will be no more suffering.
666K view 6 hours ago. Watching at 6 am.  What a coincidence.  Or is it a judgement day?
I will say, the only thing i am really worried about is a Cordyceps Virus that can be transmitted to humans.
What more fucking evidence you need to realize it came from the lab. Holy shit this channel has lost SO MUCH credibility.
I feel like there is s.o out that didn't really think about this and is sayin' while watching this video:"hmm never thought abt i am gonna do it"
This channel is sophistry for hire.
7:26-7:27
Where's the intro????
Thanks for the idea...
I absolutely love the accuracy of the pug animation.
Very revealing video. I had no idea how dangerous and (relatively) simple it is to create bioweapons like this...
I love that umbrella...
Thank you, Kurzgesagt, now I know how to play Plague Inc. IRL.
Viral of Medical Journology 😂😂
Convenient.  Don't you mean stuff that's manufactured in labs like Wuhan?? Oh that's right, this channel is bought and paid for by the Gates foundation.
Wow thats scary
This video really shows me you guys stay true to the scientific method, are aware of conflicts of interest, have learned from criticism, and persist through a ton of shit with a careful optimism I cannot otherwise categorize than an act of love. Thanks for your intellectual honesty. You're putting effort into saying what you need to say to make understandably skeptic people at ease without judging them for their paranoia. That together with the education in and of itself is what helps heal the world and guide us all on a better path.
No Birds??????
Glad that we have learned now it did come from a lab in China.
Needs more ducks
Just improve your immune system and don't be so dependant on technology
Am I the only one who’s disappointed that this video didn’t take 5 extra seconds out of my precious time on this earth to play the theme jingle?
We should never limit access to information. And the reason is simple. Science might miss the opportunity to solve a problem if information is limited. For example, after 15 years of running powerful computers  on a protein folding problem without resolution - Gamers solved that same problem in a record time. I personally think that not having information is much worth than having to much of it. Though we should restrict access to the needed materials to create such dangerous things.
I feel like your videos became more tragic than informative, i don’t know if it had to do with the Nuclear Bombs videos doing well but it feels like everything you guys upload now a days its just apocalyptic and tragic
The shop link in description isn’t clickable
Yo?
Came for the NPC comments about how humans are the worst   You did not disappoint comment section
I'm so pressed about that pug, you did that poor thing so dirty
while I don't work in biotech and only have a GCSE in Biology, i do work in cybersecurity and I can see incredible parallels between this and cybersecurity. In terms of the arguments around freedom of information and risks about sharing information that could be considered dangerous versus the benefits of a network that is able to freely share information, in my opinion and I feel like the consensus unless you have just discovered something that is nuclear bomb equivalent then we will enter a dark age of scientific advancement (or technology advancement) and even then the enforcement needs to be on the tracking and consequences of the individual, organisation or nation state that is doing things that are untoward or possibly have consequences for humanity or a large area of the planet. You can right now get code or 'equipment' that could in the right hands cause devastation against the right targets but they are still out there because people want them to be, also at what point does it become dangerous for us to be investigating and keeping it secret if it were to leak? We have seen before government researching vulnerabilities that give them incredible levels of access or influence that they can use for espionage which have then been stolen by hostile countries and used against them at society wide level which makes you wonder what is the point of having this at all if people are willing to go that lengths to get it unless it is shared and individuals are enforced
COVID came from the Chinease lab. Why is that hard to admit, its much more likely than some bat mutation and then someone eating the bat.
If we can make it to a point of automating nearly every job and replacing the average paycheck and possibly welfare programs with UBI, then it would be a lot easier to stay home and have necessities delivered to avoid exposure to a new high-risk pathogen. It's scary to think about how much power fully-automated companies will have though. Their business expenses could eventually go down to nothing more than the cost of the raw materials and (hopefully) taxes with renewable energy and automated labor adding all the additional value. I just hope that at that point we will all have a good standard of living with a decent, reasonable amount in UBI. The dangers that face humanity are plentiful, but so are the contingencies that we can create.
You mentioned one part of the defense against new viruses is developing new vaccines more quickly. That sounds risky and obviously doesn't leave room for long term studies. Why not also get better at repurposing existing safe drugs to help people fight off the viruses? This approach worked exceptionally well with COVID when it was actually tried and not inexplicably blocked by our health regulators
The psyop is that it came from nature. The truth is that it was lab grown and Fauci funded. There are people who believe their governments than their are people who are smart enough to not believe their governments.
biotech may be the great filter
Need to protect those pharmaceutical profits
Why are you misleading people? Are you afraid that YouTube will punish your channel?   It’s not even a debate anymore that COVID came from a Virology lab in Wuhan. Fauci lied and was actually, along with China, implicit in funding gain of function research related to Viruses.   Crazy how it’s 2023 and censure is still happening.
7:24 LEAVE ME ALONE LEAVE ME ALONEEEEEEEEEE
A termanly I'll cancer patient, dies from cancer. Had COVID.. COVID death.  Young man decapitated in motorcycle accident.. had COVID.. COVID death... So it's very unlikely that 7,000,000 died as they claim upward of 80% of records are death with COVID and not from.. so if you don't have an exact figure to report as if you do.
I thought we *did* manage to confirm covid-19 was the result of a lab leak?
People are the worst.  Plain and simple.
O_O
nice now do AI regulation video. fu**ing decels.
Let’s just be glad there isn’t any prion (might have misspelled) attacks, because the body couldn’t fight that off easily and those things and cause necrosis  Not zombies of course, but rotting alive is a horrifying idea
Anyone noticed the Resident Evil reference at 6:48 ?
Where’s the intro?
I work in Biology. When we order a part of a dangerous virus we have to sign a paper saying "I promise not to use this to replicate the virus". That is it.
Interesting... where is our knowledge when it comes to HIV and Malaria vaccines !
Oh you mean like how the HIV GP120 protein was found on covid s spike proteins? Who has patents on HIV Gp120 I wonder, oh yes, its Fauci.
Wish he went into more detail about covid, as it was 100% a lab leak and very likely engineered with malicious intent
I got the COVID vaccine and now I feel body degrading 😔
7:25 AMONG US
i appreciate everything you guys do and all the merch is always amazing so don't worry about anything just keep doing what you're doing oh and narrator always great job just keep doing that
thank my dream of virus that makes people lactose intolarant can be mad in my garage
Finally we can have dogs walking and talking like humans. Then we don't have to wait 1,000,000 years for kangaroo to evolve by themself.
4:10 Isn't the whole entire genetic code of one of the deadliest viruses on some free to open and use page
i was half surprised that there was no existential threats mentioned almost half of the video… but then i got my daily dose of “the end is near” :) immediately after the video tapped into the possibilities of multiple dead viruses released to the world by bad people…  :)  right, i go back building covid-25… it wont be deadly but it will give you the fourth color receptor… or maybe it will be deadly too… depends how upset i will be after having that receptor :)
"Unknown covid virus"
the one video i wanna see from Kurzgesagt has gotta be the thing about how some people have a narrator in there head and how some people imagine things in there heads
Who wants to bet that in 5 years a zombie apocalypse happens and the scientists immediately find the cure and cure the virus 💀💀💀
i couldn't help but to notice that you forgot to play the intro
treating pathogen dna as a serious info hazard also makes work on vaccines and preventative measures significantly harder. Yes some regulation is required, but presenting strict regulation as such an absolute solution is unreasonable and makes it seem more black and white than it is.
Maybe this is a stupid suggestion, but couldn't they somehow determine whether one of the virusses in the lab has a common ancestor with the current corona virus? Because if we somehow could pinpoint when they diverged, we could easily determine whether it was a lableak or not.
The dna bomb from advanced warfare in real life
Rule number one: Keep fauci and his friends well away from any biotec research.  Damn.....too late.
So basically if someone wants to destroy humility they have to think 30+ years ahead of everyone
AMONG US? 7:24
"Unknown" Corona virus. Since they've now openly admitted that it 100% came from the Wuhan lab, the only unknown part is was it released accidentally or intentionally.  More and more scientists are now leaning towards intentional.
At 4:45 on the third journal it says "NEW BATSHIT VIRUS DISCOVERED"
I literally remember extracting DNA from a strawberry in middle school. Biotechnology really is as accessible as they say in this video.
Gulp

New kurzgesagt just dropped‼️
Very happy to see you sponsored by Open Phil and featuring 80K! Great video and collab! :)
Wait… is it just me or is this video missing the intro?
Thank you bill gates foundation very cool
Yeah...3D printed viruses are a proposed Great Filter.
lmfao "this is scary" take away all subtlety and just literally tell the audience how you want them to feel.
maybe the most dangerous weapon is the friends you made along the way
We still don't know? I am pretty sure we do know don't get caught up in not recognizing facts while trying to remain neutral.
8 months of Lung infections and no German doc or hospital can find out whats wrong with me. i am Patient 0
Nukes are pretty effective - they can kill a lot of us initially, and if we get enough stratospheric smoke and dust, can limit food production and starve a lot more.   The fact that something else might be worse is pretty cold comfort.
thx
3:15 This could easily be taken out of context.

I'm not sure if eradicate all the pandemics is a good thing. First of all, there will be too many people in the planet soon, and curing everyone will not help. And, our immune system will become very low, such as all the diseases that seems meaningless for us right now, can become really dangerous.  It's pretty rough to say it that way, I can understand that. But death is necessary for the normal growth of the humanity. If we die less, we will explode the planet, with all the politics issues that goes with it. 😅
Universal healthcare systems over the world or death, simple as that
Didn't know how easy it was nor how much it costed. Thank you for making me realise I could've done this years ago at age 7. All I need is a job and a few months. Ppl think I'm lying or joking so I doubt they will track this. As since I'm "only 14" that no one that age could possibly be nearly as smart as einstien, yet they are wrong. I think its called omnicide?
7:26 Sus
This video has some seriously dangerous ideologies scattered between a poorly researched news-like format... really disappointed in this one 😢
Did Bill Gates write the script?
umbrella f
Seems a bit like propaganda, but also prophetic. Kinda sus ngl; though I can’t say entirely why.
“Really expensive things got cheap, and information could flow freely”. Thank you capitalism!
Wow, I was just talking to myself about genetic modification of mosquitos to eradicate malaria , and Zika, then I see this. What are the odds?
imagine crazy people buys biohazards then intentionally spreads it to make zombie apocalypse dream come true
Stop the bullshit we know China released the Covid virus upon the world
As if the existential dread from artificial intelligence wasn’t enough. Climate change seems like a second thought now.
its always a good day when kurzgesagt uploads
It will almost certainly end catastrophically, regardless of any safe guards. The desire to control/dominant biology/life, is insidious in of itself.
an ad told me i was watching kurzgesagt when i clicked on the video💀
Doesn't look like other Kurzgesagt videos  New manager?
Yeah, it's sure great that scientists in labs were able to crack the genetic code of Covid19 in a matter of weeks through their own efforts instead of say... just having the data transferred from Wuhan Biotech where it was being stored or something. I mean, I get that you're a sockpuppet for the Gates Foundation and the WEF, but could you at least make it less obvious?
Call of Duty Advanced Warfare predicted this with Manticore. They knew the future.
The most terrifying part of this video is the solution requires people to do things they 'should' do. The last pandemic was worse than it 'should' have been because people were unwilling to do the simplest of the things they 'should' have.
Tldr: with great knowledge comes great power comes great responsibility. This cannot be entrusted to the masses which is why scholars historically kept to themselves
Exposing a human to UVC light is really, really, like, really, not a good idea, please take that out of the video, it's completely bogus and outright dangerous
Maybe don't tell people they can make a nuke in their backyard
There is no HONEST debate as to where covid 19 came from. There is only fear of making China angry if blame is firmly attached
It is easier for people to make a dangerous weapon but also easier for someone to make the cure or vaccine. Centralising the knowledge and ability to experiment is THE MOST DANGEROUS ACTION YOU CAN TAKE!!!
Nice gaslighting.
make another world war ant video
Interesting this video doesn't mention that one of the biggest reasons bio weapon attacks are exceedingly rare is because they cannot be "targeted". Even suicide bombers and terrorists work for larger organizations who do not seek to destroy themselves. Bioweapons cannot be controlled and would cause extreme friendly fire.  As for you joe schmoe getting making a deadly plague, this video really doesn't talk about the already existing protocols. It's extremely hard for a small group of people to get access to that equipment, have the resources and time to engineer a functioning virus, and deploy that virus, without even the most incompetent government not finding out.  And of course it problematic to support further restriction of scientific information when that is already an issue in academia and research.  The threat in this video is really magnitudes lower than presented. Not a fan of this one :(
Success with nuclear you say. The existing nuclear plants are all about to shut down and research has made almost no progress. There is so much regulation that one of the best forms of energy technology is almost destroyed. Decades since power plants were built. Existing ones undergo so much restriction that they are strapped for cash and end up not fixing things they should be. A bureaucratic process so long that issues go unfixed for months. There was not success in controlling nuclear. We basically halted progress. The newest reactors cost way more and went way over budget. So much potential destroyed by fear.
this all some batshit
getting ready to do a little trolling and make covid-20
seemed like a lot of speculation in this video, interesting but certainly not your best
Bio nuclear anthrax!!!
The obliteration of humans sounds like a great boon to Earth I think.
the evolution poster in on my wall, i am from qc, canada, it looks great
The reason nuclear technology is kept under control is mostly because of how hard it is. Making a nuclear bomb is easy, getting enough of the fissile material is really hard. You need a large quantity of uranium ore, process it, and enrich it, you may also want nuclear reactors to convert it into plutonium and to get tritium if you want something more advanced than the Hiroshima bomb. It is a very expensive process that only state actors can afford. The most likely result for an individual or small group being careless with nuclear technology is that they irradiate themselves, and unlike viruses, radioactive material don't reproduce uncontrollably.

"Bio Nuclear" is EXTREMELY misleading, and I reported and downvoted the video for it.

Stop it with the covid misinformation. We've known for a long time that it leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Being a CCP apologist is morally indefensible.
Thank you Kurzgesagt for giving us fresh new propaganda that Bill and Melinda Gates foundation wants to spread
Interesting
Lab leak. All this 'progress' needs a step back from. Stop trying to advance too quickly and without enough safety in place.
Commenting so more people see this
I'm tired of all these "experts" fear mongering every time a new technology prospers. They did this with nuclear, they are doing it with AI, now it's biotech too. You CAN'T see the future so stop acting like you do.
No intro?
I'm of the opinion COVID was a lab leak. While I think no government would be stupid enough to unleash a bioweapon on its enemies, as COVID-19 proved how hard it'll bite them back, lone wolf terrorism can and will use bioweapons. I hope the governments recognize that and regulate this field as they do the capacity to create bombs, or else humanity is completely and utterly doomed.
Do not worry! The government will protect you!
and crops that taste like cardboard
I guess bill gates isn’t sure where the virus came from then
New fear unlocked
You forgot the most important reason for the pace of progress in biotech -- postdocs from India and other developing countries who do high end scientific work for very little pay.
I wish I could be as positive as the people that run this channel
''Broken down''
Cochlear implants don't connect directly to the brain; they bypass the middle ear by sending sound vibrations through the bone of the skull. Those vibrations are picked up by the cochlea the way it normally would if the middle ear wasn't malfunctioning. They're a powered microphone connected to a metal stud anchored in your bones. Another name for them is "bone-anchored hearing aids." I currently use a Bluetooth headset that works similarly by touching pads against the side of my head.
Bio-Tech freaks me the hell out if I'm just being honest.

Nah bro breathtaking at 8:26 💀
Deadly engineered viruses that kill BILLIONS of people could be the solution to global warming! Exciting! Lets gooooo!
So many incorrect facts on this one. I'm going to assume it's due to the timeline on making these.
Someone explain to me why these gain of function experiments aren’t done on an island that can be better controlled rather than next to a populated town where the scientists can go for lunch after accidentally dripping something on their arm?
pugs should never be considered a human accomplishment. they are by many medical fields considered a genetic abomination, due to all of the the health complications and skeletal deformities cause by selective breeding.  on a different note, the biggest problem for controlling an outbreak is the human element....specifically the problem with human paranoia and stupidity...USA was, and still is, a great example of that. Mass conspiracy theories, point & blaming, false information spreading; Making it a political blaming thing; Denying preventative measures, Making up false information about them that has little to no evidence, and making up excuses, all because they are inconvenienced or find it uncomfortable; Deniers of it's existence, even though it is happening around them, until it happens to them or someone they care about to them; Claiming it's something much less dangerous; and cherry picking information instead of trying to get the full understanding.
I don't like this trend to micro manage every hobbyist. The EU already made it near impossible to do any kind of hobby chemistry and I don't think it's proportional to threaten people owning sulfuric acid with jail time.
Are you kidding me? I trusted you as a science channel, but also a conduit of truth. How you just left it "open ended" regarding the already generally acknowledged coronavirus came out of the lab literally working with the same coronaviruses, not even just that the lab is named after it. I am deeply disappointed in the integrity of this channel. I mean are you even voicing this anymore? Or is this an AI to cut costs.
Hoping to keep information secret is no way to succeed. Information always becomes available, especially to anybody who is funded to get it for an attack. And science will allow most any virus to be created in a lab once you have the information coding.
6:30 we have not, actually. There's a lot of material missing from Russia.
We may never know where Covid-19 originated from, but anyone who’s been paying attention “knows”. Innocent people don’t have reason to lie, obfuscate, and burn evidence.
until we engineer a virus that's small enough to get through a microfilter, is as UV resistant as human tissue, and does more damage using the immune response of the body than on it's own. The scary part? That last one already happened. That was Covid-19. Long covid is more dangerous than short covid, and the vaccines? Well, you get long covid from the spike protein, from getting the virus, OR from getting the vaccine. Just imagine if the spike proteins were better engineered? Especially if the pandemic was "just a wild mutation", we DO know that research on bat transmissible coronavirus strains was and is being done, we do know that there was a known leak at a lab in wuhan that was working on this thing, and we know that they were working with other labs across the globe on this research. If it Covid-19 wasn't an engineered supervirus, we need to be afraid of the engineered supervirus they WERE working on, and if it WAS, we still need to be afraid of the improvements they've been making since then.  Whether or not Covid-19 was a bioengineered lab leak is up for debate for sure. We don't know that's the one that hit the world. We know there is a bioengineered bat infecting human transmissible coronavirus strain that leaked in a lab, and we know that we had a bat infecting human transmissible coronavirus outbreak stemming from that general area in a timeframe that would make sense, but we don't necessarily know that it was the bioengineered strain that leaked which caused the pandemic, or if it was a wild strain meeting the same criteria, or if the leak shared DNA with a wild strain creating something entirely new. In all of these cases, however, the implications are absolutely terrifying and we should all be very very concerned about global health, viral research, and the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Just imagine it WAS a wild coronavirus, and the horrible spike proteins were just chance evolution. Couldn't we engineer something even more deadly then?
You can't compare one of each of two types of weapons. Some biological weapons wouldn't kill many, others more. But the idea of nuclear war isn't because one bomb goes off.
Everything completely out of context
This virus stuff just feels like what was in Maze Runner
mostly unrealistic doomsday scenario
Saw the oppenheimer cameo somewhere😅
kind of the whole plot of Genocide Man. that comic series illuminated to me just how dangerous biological weapons could be

As useful as UV-C lamps are for surface sterilisation, please don't use them on people, or while people are in the room. They can cause pretty severe burns, they're just as harmful to humans as they are to bacteria.
To anyone interested in the scary side of bio engineering I recommend reading "The White Plague" by Frank Herbert

Bro did anyone else get that ad that knows we are watching kurzgesagt 💀💀💀
I will create a genetic virus that lowers the average height of the British and further deteriorates their teeth, meaning I’ll hear them complain less.
I'm opposed to regulating the open exchange of knowledge but for everything else suggested here (i.e. disease observatories, nanofilters).
Did any one got the"are you watching kurzgesagt " ad
This channel is a maniac paranoia breeding grounds 😂
Ferb, i know what we're going to do today.
What if when information about making diseases end up online, information about countermeasures is also attached? If virus info is spread freely, then so are ways to treat it.
A in depth video about a great filter
The wrong notion to present deadly viruses as great threat, it's all fully opposite in reality - only mild viruses survives. Ebola basilly destroying it's hosts so fast that it can't spread further. That's the ancient geniuses of mongol empire was with bubonic plague - they used a stable host - an insect on rats which don't suffer from very hard virus basically like transportation. Bubonic plague without such insect can be over in small region quite fast because it's too agressive to its human hosts. And thats why important to research viruses hosts, if viruses is dangerous to them - there's no danger to repeat that bioweapons trick like mongol empire did in Asia.
After 2019-2021, all we learned is that half the population will work to fight precaution and help spread viruses. One can only hope the terrorists weren't watching.
Kurzgesagt videos feel illegal to watch for free 😅
So we only have until the next genius anarcho-primitivist decides to make a bioweapon in his backyard, got it.

Are the comments censored? 🤔
ITS YOU.
And we still dont think Covid 19 waa a lab leak from china? The first recorded desth was from a worker at the lab in wuhan weird huh?
As soon as you mentioned the Covid  vaccine as though it was an achievement I had to switch off.
Buddy your dreaming if you believe the ccp when they say "this disease didn't start in one of our  bio labs it's started in a meat market" or when they said "this disease didn't start in China" they definitely 100% fumbled the ball because the Chinese government is incompetent at just about anything they do but especially health and safety regulations. They 100% lost a bat containing the virus it got out and started the spread. That or it was intentional the evidence points to one of the two. Covid 19 was not some freak natural event.

Keep information free no matter the cost.
"We don't know if it came from nature?" Come on man! Covid clearly came from a lab!
shame about those IP laws only enriching already really wealthy companies. If the tech to manufacture vaccines was more freely available, we'll see better readiness when the next serious illness spreads throughout humanity.
Septic monitoring is going to be the next big job! No sh!t!
This is the first time I’ve seen so little birbs in a kurzgesagt video
This could be revolutionary
I'd much rather the potential for citizen/independent scientists to exist. Access shouldn't be limited to just a few people, and with regulation comes increased cost (we can easily get ourselves to the point where it simply becomes too expensive to do anything because of over-regulation). I'm not concerned about random citizens making a supervirus, I'm more concerned about rouge states doing it. The fact is, regulation only helps the established by pretty well preventing anyone new from entering the space (as we've seen in many other industries).
The Open Philanthropist sponsorship is strong with this one
This was bad
plauge inc irl
There is so much exaggeration in this video, makes it sound like anybody and their mother could make a bioweapon in their backyard with a few thousand dollars worth of equipment and getting some dna sequences, but that is far from the truth, you need people to test this on, multiple iterations trial and error, its not as simple as editing gene sequences and tada! I made a biological weapon. I think it is unlikely that a bioweapon would come from someones backyard and more likely from countries like North Korea who dont have a lot of active supervision and have the human resources perform research on (though personally I think that is unlikey as well)
I think I've lost my trust in Kurzgesagt at this point and I'm wondering whether I should stay away from them. I know that you double check what you hear on the Internet, but I'm not about to start fact-checking a complex subject in which I have no knowledge. No information at all is better than manipulated information like this.
I have never seen a video more filled with propaganda lol. I think we all know corona wasn't the issue. It was the hospitals the people were going to.
Dont forget that there is a company that managed to print out fish by using premature stem cells and it was served and looked like a real fish fillets
Umbrella corp is real, btw. xD
Honestly thought this was going to go in a pen is mightier than the sword misinformation direction. I'm sure we can all agree that while they would be tragedies a deadly virus and nuclear winter are both really boring ways for humanity to go extinct. That said, I propose an honour system: Until a proper zombie virus is freely available, nobody should be uncool enough to start any whimpy and boring apocalyptic nonsense. If humanity has to go extinct, it should at least have a bit pazzazz about it. Agreed?
06:35 Nuclear non-proliferation is mostly a success?!? Please.
omg is it about dangerous things or how censorsip is awesome ? :D
Kurzgesagt please don't go giving people ideas
Nice
The virus being a leak really isn’t subject for debate at this point….
one problem I see with the given solution is those that for some reason don't use vaccines. For example, during the covid 19 pandemic we all know there were many people who refused to get the vaccine
I wasn't aware climate change was effecting crop?
Did I see the Umbrella Corp logo from Resident Evil? A little on the dot there huh?

One thing we could implement is to make it mandatory to also create a vaccine when creating a virus and publishing the research of both together. Creating Viruses without creating a vaccine for it, even for research purposes, should not be allowed.
i missed the intro 🥺
No we actually definitively know it was a lab leak from Wuhan!
Hi
why do you people keep fearmongering? I'd rather have a dangerous world than a world where im constantly monitored and controlled. dangerous freedom or safety in the form of slavery
Best free time channel for geeks
You guys are advocating for a government control of the internet, thats scary. Backyard viruses are not.
I’m wondering when a virus or microorganism that can destroy grain crops will be developed unintentionally or intentionally. Imagine the linchpin of all civilization coming undone.
So we need humanity to embrace vaccines? We're doomed. Too many dumb anti-vaxxers.
Number one biomechanical, apocaliptic scale weapon is... Human.
Y'know, potential biological armaggedon aside, we're really not out of the woods with the nukes either. Does anybody really believe that no fissile materials have slipped through the cracks since circa 1945? Or that somewhere, sometime, someone with access to existing nuclear weapons won't have that civilization-ending "oops"---or deliberate--- moment? There have already been several close calls. A healthy dose of pessimism may be quite justified here regarding humanity's hoped-for golden future.
Thank you so much!❤

*Easter egg*: Umbrella corp from Resident Evil?
Oh no ghost guns are scary
The very gray colored image you've failed or omitted to describe, implicates the narcissistic psychopaths who might narrow-mindedly decide to release pseudo-pathogens into the environment in many different "pods", without considering the multitude of factors with which those pathogens could interact with others, inside or outside of all organisms; all of this with the intention of preventing future infections before they even happen, by inoculating in favor of the immune system's cutting edge. The intention might be pure but the result is inevitably a very sophisticated betting game.  I'd rather existing cultures within human beings being gradually shifted into positive producers; a sort of organic response in favor of brute force.  There are very likely ideas like this on the proverbial table already.
Was that the Umbrella logo from Resident Evil on 6:47 ?
It's way too utopic and won't happen soon. Also if you "cure" any desease, let's say death, in this wicked world, you end up with eternal wicked rich people governing over the poor rest of the population
we are gonna become the ruin hunters from all tomorrows if we don’t get smarter
I can't order a bottle of wine online and have it delivered here, but I could order virus material and biotechnology tools and equipment.
Funny how they wouldn't suggest that maybe the cov was released on purpose, but then showed a big Umbrella company building. Way to appease both the sponsors and the general public lol.
good job!
Daft title. Nuclear weapons can end humanity in a minute, a full-scale global biological weapon release may not even end humanity at all
Pfizgesagt
the question is, are viruses "arms" and thus unable to be regulated in the united states due to the 2nd amendment
hope I was able to buy one of those posters ...   :(
Im really dissapointed by the tracking implications of this video. DNA is genetic code, and therefore just like programs, DNA information is like source code and right now you are seeing what an open source community can bring. Real benefit. You are advocating for restricting information as a security measure. Security by obscurity is not security at all.
"Wherever the last pandemic came from, the next one can be out fault.."  It WAS our fault
We all know if that exist, Kurzgesagt will be the one sharing them lol
4:46 new batshit virus detected? The bottom of the journal cover 😂
In a few months I am going to cegep. A biothechnology course. I couldn't be more hyped.
It's not that easy to make a supervirus.  And no govt or terrorist group wants to make them because its such a double-edged sword, and unlike nuclear bombs, the you can't target these things effectively.
SARS-CoV-2 is a natural virus, not a lab leak. Get your sh*t together.
Always remember that the first complete human genome was decoded in Brazil.
The most  dangerous weapon is the one that destroys what you choose to protect.  Words can fullfill this requirement.
It was up until you pointed it out that I just realized seriously how easy it is to do biotechnology work nowadays. My experiences with such laboratories were in a college setting and it all seemed so affordable compared to other types of labs I realized if I was motivated enough and had enough funds I could likely make my own Bio lab.
Comment for engagement
COVID BE LIKE
Yep keep the monopoly on bio-weapons power locked and use it to threaten countries than do not have access to it, just like nuclear.
Sounds like someone is promoting a heavy authoritarian control system “to fight viruses”. Nothing out of the ordinary for this politically correct propaganda mouthpiece.
I have done microbiology, and started carrier in Instrument marketing, this is true, where once in India next gen sequencers were few, nowadays I sold em like popcorns, from Oxford nanopore, that sequencer can fit in your pocket, you can sequence the virus anywhere in the world, also consumanble cells are cheap at just 1000$ for 24GB of data.

But still no cure for Autism 😓
9:38 we set high standards for you because you have been teaching us,
The fact that the possibility that Corona came from a lab leak is still a controversial debate, shows that we are not at all prepared for this...
I have always worried and thought the end of the world would be caused by this. As this stuff becomes easier and easier it takes one group of well funded terrorists and they could feasibly kill a lot of people.
Where intro?
great. I bet most no one  knew this before, but now everyone's gonna be starting pandemics. lovely. cant wait! (this isn't sarcastic. I just hate people.)
Loved the Umbrella reference.
Uh. we 100% are sure covid was from a lab. Like really? I can’t believe you would say we are not really sure.  It cane from a lab in a town where there is literally a lab studying viruses where the FIRST case of covid was discovered AND we have documentation now to prove it.
4:45 first swear in a kurzgesagt video? bat what virus???
This channel is now just worthless corporate slop, like someone taking a wikipedia page and turning it into a video.
Not sure if it came from the lab in Wuhan China that was working on gain of function research when the virus was discovered? It came from that lab.

7:26
Sorry guys, my breakfast didn't go so well
Why don’t we just have the government classify the dangerous info
"Information that poses a danger to society if it's shared without care." "If you [order dangerous DNA online], you should be tracked."  RED FLAG.  Do not open the doors for governments or corporations to restrict what they consider to be ""dangerous information"" for the public to know about.  For every bad actor, there are countless more good actors. The restriction of information will only serve to make good people's jobs harder, make solutions and advancements arrive slower, and shift the balance of power EVEN MORE in favor of the elite.  Do NOT give reasons for the public to feel complacent about being MONITORED and UNINFORMED.
To create a biological weapon, one would need a safe place to experiment and mass produce it in the first place. It is not just a simple lab, unless they want to kill themselves before any successful experiment. So, the human society would need to govern the in and out of lab's material and equipment. <-- This is actually very important. About the spreading of knowledge and information, I don't think that would be an issue. Because, if there is a dangerous pathogen, people should know about its information before we can create the cure. It is better that we know about its danger. If some organization has the mean to use something as a weapon, he/she won't share it to public in the first place. Somewhat like the rumor that "US military lab create the covid" or "China virology lab create covid". They wouldn't want the public to know. Even if they planned to do so, they must has the cure before spreading the pathogen, unless they want to kill themselves.
yuh
There is a mountain of circumstantial evidence pointing towards a lab leak. For natural origin, there is only scientists that like GoF research saying it.
Did someone else also noticed that ad, which predicted that we're watching this video, or was it just me?
I have learned so much more than what school has taught me
1:00, of course, COVID was a leak or release of laboratory gain-of-function experiments.

I enjoy these videos so much because they keep science kind of simple and super informational. I can wait will they talk about the recent gravitational waves that were found in the physics world.
10:09 you cant be based without being cringe before, cheers, goods lads
This seems very fearmonger-y, given that the necessary scientific literacy to create a bio weapon (which this is basically about) isnt present on a large scale. So even though people can fiddle with dna if they wanted to fairly easily, making a bio weapon is a far different thing entirely.
I mean, could we emulate the immune system's library?  It would be hard as hell, but not impossible, right?  Or could that just make the problem worse?
Knew the comment section would be filled with anti vaxxers and conspiracy theorists. Y'all shouldn't even be watching science channels lmao
7:26 get out of my head
But still nuclear is more devastating than bio weapons as bio weapons only target human but nuclear bombs obliterate everything and creatures in it vicinity and new life also have to suffer. To kill humans bioweapon tsunami earth quake are the best option rather than nuclear weapons.   Note: I am not saying to kill every human, I am only comparing what nuclear bomb is.
2016 crispr and cas9 made genetic study and work literally 100 times cheaper as well as more accurate, creating a renesance of bio work. May 2021 the first human genome were completely mapped. Both are milestones that makes similar work faster. We pretty much live in the dawn of of advanced bio-work, just as we lived in the dawn of advanced computing late 90s early 00s.
MOM! Phineas and Ferb are building a world-ending bio weapon again!
...no, we know it came from the lab.  The very first people to get sick were the people working in the lab.  If it was from wild animals or the wet market, some locals would've gotten sick first.
why do we want to kill ourselves? -_-
I like the use of the umbrella corp logo in the video 😜
How about having Labs, that work on dangerous viruses, NOT being placed in cities and town but some remote ass island where only specialists reside? May help?
I don't normally disagree with your videos, but you've really lost the plot with this one. I work in discovery phase vaccine R&D. The easy accessibility of scientific research is central to our work. Even if you put a layer of beaurocracy and made sure myself and fellow scientists could still access, youre still slowing down vital research. We are perpetually in a time crunch as it is. There is already tons of oversight when it comes to purchasing genetic materials, especially on individuals, we dont need to start restricting public access to information, too.   Besides, the general public is already terrified of biotech due to decades of fear mongering. Putting our research behind a wall will just stoke that paranoia. Transparency is the best policy.
Weren't there any secrets or suspicious activities committed by the Chinese government? I'm no expert journalist or investigator but rumors spread quickly so it counteracts to what you said about having "information shared freely" in the first half of the video.
They could have done a Dr Stone reference
This video first applauds the global networking that has made the quick development of biotechnology possible.  It then proceeds to say that it must be controlled because there's a risk of people creating bioweapons. In my country we use to say "you should make peace with your own brain".
That’s interesting, I didn’t knew that biotechnology has a massive boom in the moment. I hope it will help humanity.
Any All Tomorrows enjoyers here?
1:33  Incorrect.  Only part of the human genome was mapped by 2003.  The process wasn't completed until 2022.  3:31  Incorrect.  We do know that Covid was leaked from the Wuhan Virology Institute.  We don't know if it was intentionally leaked.  9:09  You're finally admitting that we shouldn't trust you.  I've known this for a long time as you get so much wrong in your videos.
Aaron keener will be real
This video is simply false and misinformative, I'm a master in biotechnology and have never worked with dangerous pathogens, in my university there's only 1 lab permitted to do so and they rarely do, it's not simple to get things like deadly viruses. Process of acquiring one for research is harder than getting permits to work on animals, which is impossible without a good reason.
Using Star Wars and Star Trek to show what can go horribly wrong was great.
ok the comparison with the wolf and the pug is terrifying and why I only go for mid size dogs. Tiny dogs are just too engineered for my liking.
I would buy every poster you guys make ... but I live in a tiny one room apartment that's only about 240 ft^2.  I'll get a few though.  :D
I know 2 people who have an autoimmune disease. The idea that the same technology that could at least help them could also be used to destroy them and everyone I know scares me. I don’t want them to hurt, but, as with everything, caution and safety need to come first.
stop being paid by bill gates, then ill watch your videos. No more PROPOGANDA
"unknown coronavirus"  I had a giggle.  Thanks for the clown show.
oh look more sponsored content brought to you by Bill Gates
They didn't do proper tests for the covid-19 vaccines.
Yeah, it developed countries you can't just order a virus online. You'll be monitored and contacted very fast at the very least. And behind the cells, if you are indeed making a virus. Even for a professional laboratory, it's not that easy to work with pathogens, there are a lot of restrictions and lab safety certification, before you can work with something even remotely dangerous.  Not sure it is this way somewhere in third-world autocratic state though. If anyone would do such viruses (and I'm pretty sure they do that already), it's not some guy in a garage in the States. It's the governments.
it was very easy to reverse engineer the covid-19 virus, because we already had the blueprint of how it was created...can you say.. Wuhan Institute of Virology lab leak!!!
I stopped watching at 1:05. It is still impossible to make a vaccine in couple of months. Covid mRNA jab was never a vaccine, it is a bio weapon. You seem still not understood it.
Bio nuclear has the word nuclear… doesn’t this contradict video title
Thanks for the tip
Funny thing is someday building a nuclear reactor could be a 10th grade engineering project.
- we thought we will never stop to starve and we started agriculture - we thought we will always fear other animals and we stared to use fire -we thought we will always be sick and we are starting to build biological solutions
Genetic filter weapons!
OMG  Martie's back :DDDD
2:56 is that a tan bed?
Why are you still pretending that covid wasn't a manufactured crisis?
Когда у вас уже будет дубляж
I'm an biotechnology engineer, and I don't have work, please help me:((
Gamer
We already have the blueprint on how to address biological concerns: our immune system.
The thing is, this applies to all of science
Why do i feel this is propaganda against free knowledge?
Basically anyone can go make a fully functional gun in their home and go on a rampage just cause they want to, very little could be done to stop someone from doing that. But it's not a major problem because overall people are good, people don't want to cause problems and hurt others. Accidentally or purposefully creating a supervirus is similar, I think. Even if anyone could do it, it's unlikely to happen.  Not to say don't do anything to avoid something bad happening, but just a reminder that people are generally good and also technology will always be getting better and more accessible, and that should be hindered as little as possible.
For anyone who wants to know what they were referring to, the research they were talking about is called Gain of Function Research and it's the Government Sanctioned process of essentially weaponizing natural viruses in order learn how viruses become more deadly. Comparing this technology to nuclear is actually pretty absurd because no one can build a nuclear bomb in their basement and contrary to what others in the comments have said, claiming it's not incredibly easy now, that's irrelevant, it's that it's about to be. Tools like DNA printers and online databases of viruses are becoming incredibly prevalent, the sequence for The Spanish Influenza was a published online in 2004 and a team was able to recreate the horse pox virus from scratch in under a year and that was in 2017, the technology has only gotten faster since then and it's only going to get far faster. You don't even need almost any resources to do this stuff and the scary thing is a lot of people not motivated by political gain have plenty of resources to do this. As a prime example the death cult Aum Shinrikyo was able to synthesize VX Nerve Gas and unleash it on 2000 people. They had a biological weapons program but the technology just wasn't advanced enough back then, now it is. For any bad actors this is becoming incredibly easy, let alone a country or a t*******t organization. Thank you Kurzegesagt, it's about time somebody talked about the looming synbio catastrophe, and every time I talk about it I'm accused of spouting the Lab Leak Hypothesis and by implication a racist.
If this is not scaremongering, I don't know what is. Creating a deadly virus is about as difficult as creating an atom bomb and if it's going to happen, It's going to be done by state actor not some individual. Covid vaccine nonavailability was a great example of why we need more public-domain genetic research, not less.  All vaccines were manufactured and sold with large profit-margin despite most vaccines being created with the understanding that nations would bear the financial risk. Even the Oxford vaccine, research of which was predominantly public-funded, was essentially handed over to AstraZeneca. We need a regulatory shift in the opposite direction, aimed at reducing the barriers to entry for new biomedical companies and shortening the duration of patent protection.
alright guys count your days cus its me going to do this humans are a cancer we need well i need to take care of
I never expected kurzgesgart to use a word like infohazard. I'm disappointed, this is leaning on censorship
The blessings of grandfather nurgle will spread.
The umbrella corporation 😂😂😂, I see you😂
Let's not do gain-of-function research in dense urban areas.
Who is we? Who gets the informations?
The words "info hazard" made my head explode with so many SCPs. Is this real life?
This has to be one of the weirdest videos this channel posted!
Building an iPhone in high school for homework reminds me of my own time in high school... but that was 15 years ago and iPhones didn't even exist yet; certainly not in the hands of us students  No, what we did in high school biology included that experiment where you extract DNA out of an onion, and using RT-PCR screening to look for cancer cells.  This was _fifteen years ago,_ remember - so I can't help but wonder what they're doing in high school biology now
12 monkeys anybody?!
Me who just watched COWBOY BEBOP movie 😂
Lets hope it stays safe^^
Havent actually worked in the feild yet, but im at uni, and this sounds A LOT more fear mongery than it probably should. The idea that "anyone" can just access the materials and information needed to create a biological weapons program is slightly farfetched, to say the least. Although i cant speak much for the US or other places, the UK seems to have plenty of regulations and steping stones that need to be crossed befor you can get a bottle of smallpox out of the freezer. And i have a feeling the rozzers might have some questions if you order a "DNA printer 3000" for "Home use".
The lab leak theory has been scientifically disproven many times in highly-cited articles. The intelligence agencies are using the wrong tools for the job to determine whether or not it came from gain of function research. Simply looking at the rate of mutation, signatures of modification, and the lineage by which it evolved, everything points to it coming directly from an animal. It's still possible a sample taken from an animal was stored, and an accident triggered the event, but the scientists must have done nothing but frozen it.  As someone with a background in biology, I take issue with the casual nature of discovery and engineering this video takes in biotech. Randomly stumbling upon a mutation that is both harmful and can rapidly spread would take thousands of dollars of animal models, not to mention expensive facilities to house them. To do so without animal testing would be as likely as encountering a novel virus in the wild: not impossible but not significantly more risky than our current landscape.  Genetic engineering still requires expensive reagents, expensive equipment, and at least some tricks of the trade. There are biohackers that can replicate some easy techniques, but there is a huge difference between making something that survives in a lab and something that can spread in the environment.  But the tone of the video is correct: we must create a robust framework of ethics and laws to prevent rogue agents from developing terrible new bioweapons. The biggest reason they haven't been developed is it's like a gun that points at you and your enemy. And once fired, the bullet can morph into a canonball or a nerf dart. They are horrible as weapons for states.  But for terrorism, they are perfect. The collateral damage can hide the intention of an attack, and the unknown nature of it can inspire fear. I have no idea how we mitigate attacks from larger terrorism networks other than what we must do for pandemics: develop tools to stop them and set up a network of monitoring stations everywhere as a measure of global security.
Today on Kurtzgezagt: existential dread
This just feels like fearmongering to me. :(
Nice video as always!
I've played the Division... I know how this ends
when did we develop a vaccine for covid? We have shots for it that work nothing like vaccines, but not a vaccine.
Does anyone have any idea on what I should call my new black death
The "scientists". And here I thought you'd say geneticists, not the simple path like the "scientists" 🙄Ugh.
"dont know for sure if it came from nature" when all the evidence suggests that Coivd came from a Wuhan Lab lmao
It's all yin yang, dark light, up down, day night...good and not so good. (Ok, Bad.)
If only politicians around the world were focused on science and good public policies
And the world after this video - : let's do all what they said, but opposite.
Congratulations at first I thought oh wow they're going to talk about the free exchange of ideas and then it immediately turned into destroy everything and track anybody who has this knowledge. You guys are scum.
People making deadly diseases in their backyards - Papa Nurgle likes it!
As Tvtropes entry goes, "Genetic Engineering is the NEW Nuke".
When I got covid, in 2020, my body got rid of it in less than 48 hours
Yes, the last 1% of battery spent well
9:10 most embarrassing thing was on Kurzgesagt, when they made an unchecked, misleading video about migration crisis.  But they are Germans they always forget their mistake and how many times they tried to ruin the world.
"New Batshit Virus" XD Thanks for the nice video
I understand the reason to counter pandemic and diseases, it's just our population is increasing as well
kurzgesgt videos are like antidepressants.  they make the future seem possible and fun to think about <3
fort detrick
What do you mean we still don't know where COVID came from??
catgirls when
The Most Dangerous Weapon is a person mouth.
1:00 😂 yeah...and what a vaccine it was! So effective they had to change the definition of the word.
I loved the Umbrella Corp and Jurassic park references in this one.. and the video itself is phenomenal as always! I love watching these and learning about the different aspects they feature.
It was China. C H I N A.
Tbh I'm more concerned about the potential for eugenics opened up by biotechnology. I'm really hoping designer babies don't catch on
Yay!!!!! Saw the targeted ad!!
grimace shake is the most dangerous bio weapon in human history
This is well intentioned, but it runs the risk of further segregating the world between developed and undeveloped. This will obviously have the effect of slowing down science in underdeveloped countries.
Horzine: 😮🍆
This video seems dramatic and more harmful to backyard research, hopefully governments dont end up locking down biotech to the point where biohackers cant research
This video exaggerated too much. We don’t know as much as we think we do, since most of the studies were done on cancer cell lines, and creating a pathogen is much harder than we think as virus/host co-evolved for millions, even billions of years. SARS2 has 30 kilo bases in its genome, in theory we could create something similar and be deadly but no one really knows how.
You can actually survive the bio weapon if you just go to greenland
The most dangerous weapon is humanity. Just look at the seas, the forests, and think of what caused them.
Ferb, I know what we’re gonna do today!
7:26
The Most Dangerous Weapon is: Stupidity XD
Plague Inc 😢
Yup, that stuff needs better regulations, but most countries will not follow suit so just like with AI we are stuck with an arms race that could end the world as we know it.
Thanks for admitting your mistake and fixing it. I have massive respect for you for that.
3:45 no its still up to political debate. non political scientists are practically at a universal agreement that it was made in a lab  there is no scientific debate to be had when the argument that it came from bats cant show a bat species that is contaminated nor a wet market victim it originated from and the argument it didnt come from a wetmarket has genetic scientists that have studied the genome of the wuhan flu and said such a thing cant be replicated in nature and patient 0 seems to be Ben Hu who worked at the lab in question studying gain-of-function research
Nuclear weapon just like little sparking firework use to scare each other. If it be use to destroy cites area around such as rurals will just see it as light flash and think they forgot to turn of the light and back to normal life. But bioweapon are like wild fire very hard to control.
Incredible as usual
The most dangerous weapon is NOT nuclear ,ITS a Woman 🫡stay safe boys
GUYS, WE NEED TO GET HIGHSCHOOLERS TO MAKE IPHONES!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE CHILDREN YEARN FOR THE MINES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My new hobby
seeing how kurzgesagt has a history of putting random pokemon in their videos im suprised i didnt see mewtwo in one of those test tubes
This is why I'm scared of us using AI
I wrote an essay on this exact topic a few months ago. I can’t believe Kurzgesagt agrees with me.
Can't wait until a Chernobyl like accident happens but with viruses and the bio tech industry gets slowed down by 50 years due to fear of the public!!!!!!1!11!!
what a lot of people don't understand, and what I've been saying since the beginning, is that COVID was a dress rehearsal. The reason the world acted so swiftly and harshly against a disease with a less then 3% fatality rate, was because it was a training exercise. We can look at the data now, and tell which nations passed, and which ones failed *Cough* America *Cough* .
For some reason I don't want humans to take control of biology
This is the one field of science where we should not act as if we are God. We need to be VERY careful with this.
Im creating a supervirus and assassinating the human race. Thank you so, so much kurzgesagt!

"Accidental leak" lmao
So I can use this to get rid of the annoying classmate?
Freedom above security. No restrictions.
they got so fast cause covid was discovered decades ago maybe?
I knew this for decades as a dod researcher in a bio lab.
it came from a lab
Big pharmas are soooooooooooooooo niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiceeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
This pug... Flashbacks with rabies...
"Its becoming easier and easier to engineer a virus in your backyard" ferb, I know what we're gonna do today
I actually have Covid right now, for the first time, and I'm at high risk, so I'm lucky I just got it, but ALSO, I'm very sick. However, with new meds and all the vaccines, I'm not in the hospital, so that's a win.   Ps. Love the content, I'm an astrophysics major in Florida, and I've been watching for years. I get excited every time I see a notification for this channel. Keep up the good work.
THIS IS LITERALLY THE PLOT OF IRON HEART
I love kurzgesagt so much that i like the videos before even watching
Calling covid a 'relatively mild' disease is absolute nonsense. It's killed 7 million (that we know of) and has left more than 10 times that number with permanent disabilities.
2:40 Kurzg...gt hoping you asked for money to Apple, or was it a free ad for the "in need"? you ask enough for money to the viewers
Crops resistant to climate change. *Sponsored by MONSANTO.*
Wonder if the elites will ever subject themselves to biotech upgrades? Or just leave that to the peasants and laugh at the outcomes, while they themselves stick to garden variety adrenochrome.
Not bad
Considering how our world is currently controlled by capitalistic corporations and the government bought by them, it is clear to me that 1) these are the people we should worry about making a bio nuclear bomb (not the average human in its backyard); 2) it will take a lot of social effort for us fo achieve those 3 bullet points. We saw what social inequality did in the last pandemic. That being said, as usual this was an amazing informative video, keep them coming!
My apt just has metal posters I would 10000% grab one from Displate if you guys collaborated
The startrek solution, would be to find cures to all these diseases, and viruses, not throttle learning, you fear mongering bullshit destroys society. im blown away by these scare tactics.
Wait a second… where is the intro?
I'm looking forward to reading about the batshit virus! (4:46)
The internet is one of the strengths of Biologists, and you usually enter this field because of the love for the topic of life and preserving/studying/protecting it. There are so many protocols for handling anything including sensible data and there is a fixed structure for keeping things in order and monitoring sales. If something bad would happen, it would be for iil intentions of management (specially government) or unethical/sloppy biologists because the structure is so tight. I wouldn't worry about another disaster coming from the scientists, but i would worry about the systems that allow and encourage the unethical study of these topics (NK is a mayor worry). Even with all of that, i really agree with the methods, because you can never be too sure about these microscopic things and the people handling them.
-
Your video is dangerously close to fear mongering and goes agaisnt every battle that has been fought for open scientific information. Information on how to create a nuclear bomb has been available for years and it doesnt take much to go from there to build the nasty ones. same with chemical weapons. Biotech is expensive for the end user, and vector libraries are notoriously difficult to transfect if you dont have the right cells to do it with. You could scare politicians into making publications even more locked down warranting more things like sci-hub to form. BE CAREFUL
Find a solution to reduce human greed and evil plots will go away from sight.
imo when states like china and korea still exist there is no actual reason to limit our scientists and shoot ourselves in the foot in terms of open sourceness.
Hell with this new information. I can't wait for them to make medicine tailored to each individual human.
4h
We need to forget the idea we can control something we can never in totality ever have full control that’s an illusion a fantasy which is the same one that dragged the Titanic into the bottom depths of the sea. Once we realize that and are always on edge we can always be ready for the unexpected and not fall or fly too high ending in our destruction due to our inherent pride our hubris.
Also can we make blue mammals with genectic modification
Yes restrict knowledge, divide and conquer, let the peasants fight among themselves
Scientists do not share with other scientists [all] the time.
That satellite saying “Hello?” hit hard.
and then someone in their basement gets a hold of a biogenerating AI and a very expensive accelerator card, builds a superweapon and accidentally infects their cousin while in a speech about how cool their virus is
The factorty Must GROW!!!
This is the most doomer scare the people bullshit I’ve ever seen, shame
Knowledge is power, and everyday our knowledge increases a little faster
If people managed to make rabies airborne, it would be an extremely dangerous bio weapon
So you are telling me terrorist will in the future kill millions in their attacks by spreading viruses?
Renember biotech is the tool of the infierior factions
Capitalism is a blind spot for this channel. The information isn't shared freely. The pandemic showed how wealthy nations also hoarded vaccines that went bad when poor nations tried to talk them into sharing them before they went bad. Also scientists work for corporations that do things for profit,  that hurts people, but ignore Capitalism to our detriment.
Resident evil 9
Propaganda..
Unknown Corona Virus LOL!!!
Paranoid much?
COVID was clearly a lab leak
"This video was sponsored by Open Philanthropy" Absolutely zero credibility left here, unfortunately
This is legit the conversation one of my anthropology professors has had with us within the last two years.
Looking at the Ruzzian invasion of Ukraine - nuclear is pretty much a threat. Viruses will be too, because there is no oversight whatsoever
We could use this technology to make more beneficial bacteria, couldn't we?
You should put Jerma985 in your videos
good luck doing that under capitalism.
I hate to say it, but Kurzgesagt seems to simply spout random nonesense in order to stir people up. It really is not that simple to design a virus that is as deadly as is described. Even if we saw something that could kill hundreds of millions, it's likely that progress on gene therapy might prevent such a virus from working the way that any such bad actor might expect.  This is very clearly an attempt by some group funding this channel to increase governmental regulation of something that could heal untold billions into the future. Kurzgesagt's team really should try to ensure to leave bias as the door when making these videos. Attempting to mislead the public with claims of danger will almost certainly lead to a worse life for all of humanity in the future.
one word: darkweb
Kurzgesagt: Nowadays anyone could create a gobal pandemic.  Me: Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today...
9:55 Did somebody say flying lemur? *Momo from Avatar has joined the chat*
3:14 wow the video did a full 360 really fast lmfao
there wasn’t any ducks until the end of the vid :(
Covid was more man made than fake tits🤦‍♂️
Wow. What a poorly researched doc. Nowhere do you point out that we are already monitoring who orders dangerous sequences to some degree. This is unusual fear mongering from this team.
The idea that someone could sneakily make nuclear bombs on their property is absolutely terrifying to think about
I just hope that they can use bio tech for celiac disease and other autoimmunie diseases
No debates here, the pox came from a fxck1ng lab leak.
Bro with the guitar does not look like he’s playing guitar
3:50 what the flip is umbrella doing there from RE
In the future it's likely that a virus will be created where the cure is simply to take or have taken an existing vaccine. People who get vaccinated or have a history of vaccinations turn out fine, people who refuse to be vaccinated or to vaccinate their children... aren't. Repeat this enough times and even if a superbug came out in the future that could wipe out humanity, you could be certain that all people on earth would take the vaccine to cure it and stop it spreading asap.
I think I might've waited maybe a _few_ years before releasing this one.
Why does this video sound like it was written by chatgpt?
I have mixed feelings about this 😁
I love the content that being shared by nutshell but I disagree with the content in this video biotech knowledge should be shared and open not regulated and be restricted to a certain group of people this will cause more problem from mistrust to fear mongering
3:50 6:48 Kurzgesagt has at least 1 Resident Evil fan on staff
NO WAY HE POSTED!
Very disappointing. It does not work like this, regardless whatever some Netflix documentary claims. In reality it is way way way more complicated. And if some weirdos try to do something like this in their backyard, they most likely only kill their own bank account. This stuff is not cheap. And maintaining it isn’t either.   Oh, and by the way: stomping a whole area of fields of science (we most probably need in the very future to survive our own mass extinction) really hurts. But, well … Good luck fighting the next pandemic without what is left of free science! 😢
I have full faith the people who work at this channel never allow their principles to be compromised. Thank you for doing what you do.
Like how some of the people making the super viruses in the video are in an Umbrella building
So you are advocating for paygate knowledge ????
do you have any books for sale or just posters  i hope that
Bioengineering is nothing like nuclear power. How many high schools build nuclear bombs?
comparing "its" control to radioactive materials and refined weapon grade uranium is flat out idiotic. this channel really went to shit last 2 years..
Nuclear weapons programmes were also born from the search for nuclear energy, just as a flip side to nuclear energy being born from the weapons programmes
This is how the modern world ends. There are cultures that want nothing more than to see humanity returned to the 12th century. A bioengineered virus is by far the most dangerous threat we face.
The most dangerous weapon is human stupidity, especially those who refuse to vaccinate or wear masks in a pandemic....cough cough conservatives.
We wondered if we could without ever considering if we should.
MFers NEED to watch movies. DON'T MAKE A FUCKING VIRUS. Don't make terrible viruses that are worse than any known virus. That's how movie plots begin and how apocalyptic scenarios start.
While the potential for large scale bioweapons is scary, the even scarier stuff is that it's now possible to create diseases that target a particular genome, enabling the creation of viruses aimed at a specific person or genetic group. That's much harder to detect and circumvent when it's on such small scales.
this video is lowkey the scariest one you've presented...seemed horribly realistic
The tone of the solution part of the video has changed a bit, and I like it a lot
COVID wasn’t from nature it definitely was from a lab lul.
Hey kurzgesgat I luv ur vids keep up the good work
So all the tech to rich and powerful! That would be safe for us!
That's why we buy BNGO stock!
Say there is another pandemic, how many people are going to voluntarily get the new jabs after seeing the performance of the covid shots?
Wonderful masterpiece, now gimme that glorious intro pls
You can't fix real world iPhones, Apple doesn't allow it, same for Samsung
Man you know what we need wide spread overbearing regulation that does nothing but create fear and stop progress.
If only there was a world organization that had the authority and the means to enforce such rules and monitor such activity and intervene when necessary. Right?
No intro :(
They didn’t really talk about the virus in the picture 😮
can we talk about the Michio-Kakulization of Kurzgesagt?
Oh My! He's on a roll!
Please, make a poster about the metabolic pathways in the cell
Thanks wuhan :/
56 seconds in..."The unknown coronavirus" ?? Really?. So it hasn't been around for years? Is it brand-new?
Much better investment in public health, globally, has very high return for money spent, too. Not just in slowing the spread of viruses, either.
The amount of fear created by covid, and the amount of power we threw into the government's hands, over covid, was crazy. Imagine if the Government, or an Organization for that matter, created a artificial Virus a hundred times worse than covid. The amount of power the people would just give up for safety is incredible.   Just goes to show, it might not be the backwater lone lunatic creating a virus in his basement we have to worry about, but perhaps the very one's giving us our vaccines and the such. (No shade on individual doctors tho, I'm just talking about the Big Guys.)
It’s human
The technologies needed to create superbugs are the same as the ones needed to stop them. Bioweapons are very hard to control and not all that useful for warfare. The second you drop a superplague on your enemy, all of their neighbors are going to demand you stop before it spreads to them. You'll be fighting more people than you were before and the rest of the world is not going to take your side.
It’s always a good day when Kurzgesagt uploads! 😄
Democrats are the most dangerous weapon. They will single handedly destroy a major society.
Kurzgesagt I really do like you, but you are really painting Big Pharma and Biotech companies as good organisations, instead of the sketchy things they are. I know they are primary funders, but this is worrying. Please, stop
We DO KNOW that the Corona Virus came from the Wuhan Lab ! Why is this video not following the facts??
The claim thay its worse than any nuclear bomb is wrong. A single high yeild cobalt isotoped doped nuke could end humanity
After seeing the video and going through the sources, there are a few things that I don't think were correct in the video.  The main publication the video is based on is not a scientific publication and is not peer-reviewed. It displays a clear bias against biotechnology in general, and either lacks the background or misunderstands some of the aspects of biotechnology in general.  Now, here are the things in the video that I think were not explained or understood correctly:  - First of all, with current technology YOU CANNOT CREATE VIRUSES FROM ZERO. You always need a virus to start, and then you can modify its genetic material. The hypothetical where you can get viral DNA and create a virus from it is just not possible right now.   - Not all viruses are transmitted through air. In fact, many of the most dangerous viruses currently are transported in some other way, like through body fluids (HIV, Ebola).  - "High school students experimenting with biotech". I think this statement should not have been worded as is. On the video what seems to be implied is that discoveries are being replicated. This is not correct. The original article refers to technologies, such as genome sequencing. Thus the iPhone metaphor is completely wrong, since in the metaphor it would be referring to the machines used to manufacture the iPhone, not the parts of the iPhone.   - "People will start creating viruses because it will be so cheap!". No they won't. Working with viruses is a very difficult and expensive process. Let's say we are working with the assumption that this video is based on, so someone working with viruses that can infect humans. You need a virus to start, which then you can modify and experiment with. Once you have that, you need a tissue where the virus can reproduce. Since it is a virus that can attack humans, you need human tissue. This brings some complexity. It has to be tissue from a tumor, so that cells reproduce and you don't run out of tissue. And the main problem with working with human tissue, is that it is EXTREMELY delicate. You will need a completely sterile environment (which is very expensive), antibiotics and very careful handling, because if any virus or bacteria gets in the tissue it will kill it.  -"Assembling DNA into an artificial virus costs the same as a car". You can't create an artificial virus with current techniques. What the original document is saying is that you can join the DNA pieces into one for $50000, not create a new virus from that DNA.  - Restrict information about viral DNA. Although the nuclear material analogy is good, I think it's incomplete. While restricting access to viral DNA sequences can prevent the kind of dangers you are referring to in this video, it would also cause a massive delay in the development of new measures against new natural pandemics. If nuclear weapons could suddenly appear out of thin air, you'd want as much people to know how to deactivate them as quickly as possible.  -Pandemic detectors. This are not a bad idea in principle, but you make it is sound much easier than they would be to implement. One key flaw I can see in these is that most viruses can't infect humans, so this kind of initiatives can run into a pattern of declaring potential pandemics constantly, so much that no one would pay attention to these.   -"Let's kill all viruses!". That's not a great idea. Although it would cause viral diseases to decrease, it would potentially create more problems than it would solve. Everything has a biological role, including viruses. Viruses specifically have a big role on population control. This can lead to an increase in bacterial population, thus increasing the frequency of bacterial diseases, as well as weakening our immune systems, as they need to encounter minor threats in order to know how to respond to major threats.
We do actually know that covid-19 came from the lab.
neat!
Hai
yo how come it just named my old phone [iphone 5] and by new 1 [iphone 11] ?????😅😅😅😅
One thing that I admit has always scared me.. The possibility that someone alters the rabies virus to make it airborne... Or that it somehow mutates to be airborne on its own.. It would be a world killing thing.
Am I the only one who noticed that Apple logo bite was on the wrong side?
This video feels uncharacteristically half-assed. First, the claim that it's very likely that we can contain the risk of bio weapons is way too dogmatic. I doubt any scientist in the field would take such a confident stance. Second, from a scientific perspective, continuously referring to viruses and their "DNA" without mentioning RNA just shows a professional hasn't gone over the material much.
This video is the only video from Kurzgesagt which has left a frown on my face after watching it. I have a degree in microbiology and this video makes it sound like anyone with a couple of thousand bucks and a microscope has the potential to create a deadly virus. Truth is it requires training, knowledge in the field, and expensive machines to successfully work on viruses (and most importantly SAFELY).    Our current understanding of viruses is nothing compared to say, E. coli. It’s not as simple as using gene editing like CRISPR and replacing a couple of genes to make a super mutant. Simply, the most efficient way (and quickest) way would be to use human trials to select for variants that showed higher infectious rate while also increasing lethality, but that’s not something you can just do in your backyard…
The "Unknown" corrona virus?? Who still believes that?
As someone studying biotech (2nd year uni), I never forget that I could always choose the dark side... When I was a kid I used to think I should never become a scientist because I would make a bioweapon and kill everybody. Haha. 😅
Sadly mass vaccination is not a good option anymore (with all the scandals regarding the covid and the covid vaccines)
Its bad that we try to make humans life longer... We are invasive to the whole world... Way too many humans
Yeah, the recently-famous virus was totally natural and the "vaccines" totally work and were quickly developed after the virus magically appeared. 100% true, questioning these facts is something only dangerous, crazy, criminal-minded people say.
I hit the line button while the ads are still playing. That’s how much I love your videos z
Stop giving Russia ideas, and I’d like to know why if it’s so cheap to do this biotechnology stuff, it’s still financially ruinous to have to go to the hospital for anything, lol.  Love your videos but that last bit frustrated me.
👍
Lemme tell you about this biotech lab in wuhan.
I really love how they used umbrella as the reference here
Wonder if they back logged this video because of covid
Every innovation has both positive and negative sides. It all depends on the person using it!!
Wasnt the covid vaccine based on a close relative studied 10 years ago which is the only reason it was rolled out so fast?
7:26 amogus
8:22 don't you mean neither good NOR bad?
i wish there is a way every person on plant have to watch your video
Im pretty sure most people immediately thought about Plague Inc. the fact we can experience that reality if the proper precautions aren’t taken is a little concerning, but the player will have to play on super mega brutal so I think humanity will survive.
this makes me nervous. There is always good and bad actions to anything, but I know it will only take one to start something. It is crazy how we keep on making something to be deadlier than the other thing. It only humans would learn huh.
when you say we need to control who has access to it, us means "USA".
I love @Kurzgesagt videos but am getting tired of them being a schill for coronavirus talking points. It's clearly came from the lab and that information is readily available. The vaccine didn't do anything to stop the spread of COVID. The 7mol number is coming down dramatically as we remove "died with COVID".    It's just so disingenuous of a science channel to spew politicized talking points that clearly come from the donors of the channel. I'm sure Gates loves this one
This video is quite suspect. Many other people have pointed out how some of these measures are already in place & how it's much more difficult to assemble a virus than has been implied here.  But I am content to simply reiterate: the freedom of information is a good thing!  If kids actually *were* making iPhones as a class project, can you imagine how much that would advance the average person's electronics & computer science skill? That's amazing! Sure, that means the average person is also more capable of making a remote detonator for a bomb or an awful piece of malware, but frankly I don't care. We already have ways of defending against those things & we're only going to keep getting better.  Or, take nuclear science. Don't you think that, if it wasn't born of a weapons program, we'd have more & safer nuclear reactors? It might be our best shot against climate change & a key stepping stone to the future, but it's all locked up because of exactly this kind of paranoia.  Look, I like this channel, but y'all have some really bad takes sometimes.
Watching this with a scratchy throat...... god damnit
information has to be shared
The Umbrella Easter egg :D
Blocking information never solve a problem, but doing right the opposite.
PUSHING VACCINE B S terrible video
There was no intro 🥲. Where’s the awesome and cute intro you had Kurzgesagt???🥲😂
Ferb i know what we're gonna do today
I guess you don't want to make China mad. Covid came from a lab leak. Congress revealed the documents revealing US involvement in the lab itself. So yes. The Covid virus came because humans created it and then leaked it.  What I don't get is your shameless plug for vaccines at the end. The same governments funding the creation of these viruses are funding the cures and paying these pharmaceutical companies an insane amount of money. Instead of shilling for the pharmaceutical companies why not promote hygiene, excessive, and diet. Nearly all deaths from this latest outbreak were the result of comorbidities.
It's not super easy, but not super difficult to do certain things in the Biotech field, such as Virus/Bacteria engineering.  Studied Biotech and got a degree in it, and what's crazy is how we've gone from tinker-toys to literal DNA search engines to see if genetic code is unique to an organism.  One thing I had to do was pick a research project and... well, I decided to pick CRISPR-CAS9; that was a mistake, still having them mental scars to prove it.
I fear that the biggest future threat will not be the virus, but the conspiracy theorists that will oppose everything.
I'm very confused to where my birds are!!! There are way too many humans for a kurzgesagt video!!!
I Bought like 3 of the posters. evolution, world map and periodic table, and love them. 🥰
If you can’t beat anti-vaccinationists with facts, develop a devastating viral plague
The worst virus today it's humanity himself.  Since we developed the medicine which made us less vulnerable than in 1900, we didn't learn as fast to control our population, and the time births dropped, it was already too late. And because industrial revolutions brought us inevitably the single-use products, the whole life is falling against our desire for more to more people.
Why did we make pugs bro that's like some all tomorrows type shit but for dogs
Omg y’all look on 6:42 on the top it says “ Doctor Bombastic’s Bomb tutorial”😂
Its annoying how this video makes scientific progress seem inevitable and easy... like its something that just happens and can be taken for granted. Progress takes real work.
3:50 is that the evil pharmaceutical company umbrella logo from resident evil?🤣🤣
When they said it could create Diseases I instantly thought of the dollar flu from the division
I am currently reading immune.. it is soooooo amazing that i want another exact same book thoo about astronomy just when i finish reading it
Please not the Covid origin debate 🗿
Vaccines only work if everyone gets them. Way too many idiots out there doubting them.
Another great filter scenario from the Fermi paradox to my list :')
I disliked this video for a simple reason: it promotes censorship. While I am in favor of tracking people who may be trying to use information for nefarious purposes and stopping them, I am not in favor of censoring people’s access to information. That road leads to tyranny
Imagine in 2045 scientists manage to create a spiderman super power and in 2050 you will just see people climb like a spider from the street to their apartment
Thank you for making hundreds of thousand of people aware of the fact that they could easily attempt to wipe out half humanity from their backyard if they wanted to.
Yeah, but the vaccine they created doesn't stop you from getting or spreading COVID. Maybe we have a ways to go still...
Covid-19 escaped from a lab
aaaaaaaaaa scream SCREAAAAMMM WTF missinformation, panic & lies, justification for repression and control, moral bashing & deterred all condensed and camouflaged in lenguage in one single video.
Do not forget the unethical actions undertaken by the Chinese and virtually all Western Governments over the course of the pandemic. Each one failed to react in critical early stages when there was no available intelligence about the virus, and they overreacted to seize illegitimate powers, curtail the civil liberties of their citizens, and destroyed the livelihoods of millions of people when they knew the consequences of not doing so were mild. They probably did it for the shared profits from Pharmaceutical companies. The institutions of this field, and their captured regulatory apparatus is not to be trusted and should be treated with extreme apprehension.
Covid was a bio weapon developed by the CCP. Dont trust this channel, it only makes propaganda for the rich, evil
yep a bought for propaganda peice by the big pharma foundation. doesnt cover that the vid19 was being made in a lab for years before the outbreak. or that the same drug companys also sold their cure
The past month was really hard for me, had eye surgery. Everything was blurry I can’t go out, I can’t study, I can’t pick a video to watch. But even though how picky I was, your channel’s always there for me, so I just binge watch all of your vids over and over. Safe to say I watched all of your vids 3 times at least, thank you much love from Thailand 🙏
In a world where more and more of what we need to survive is own or locked by corporation greed (even seeds) i don't like the idea of discouraging free science information sharing
bros pumping out videos like if it dosent take a video 3000 hours to make 💀💀💀
This video is being sponsored by lobbyists who have previously stated their intent to attempt to restrict the flow of information, and the means of finding such. This video also follows this trend and immediately begins fearmongering about biological weapons and rogue nation-states. At a very minimum, this video NEEDS a SOLID warning about misinformation and sponsored content by youtube itself. This is not a good look for kurzgesagt, especially considering recent scandals.  Afterall; this video is heavily implying that they should restrict information. To privatise and restrict an avenue of science. Which is a violation of BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS to INFORMATION. Of Free Speech and of Free Knowledge.  There's no DANGER in letting people know these things, afterall - criminals do not care for regulations or legislation. If they want to break the rules. They will. Do gun laws stop mass shootings? Does entirely restricting them? Nope.  Why is this any different?  Stop trusting this channel. View it for amusement, pretty graphics and a kind story. But do NOT trust them at face value. Do your research.
Well, kids...  Now we know that when the next scamdemic comes, there's gonna be a loooot of scapegoats and smokecreens.  Brace yourselves 🫡
With the control over biology, we'll become the gods we once prayed. Or we'll unleash a biggest catastrophe, the universe has ever seen.
3:35  @Kurzgesagt A lot of people trust you to present accurate information and because of the research you do they take what you say as fact.  So when you present conspiracy theories like the lab leak conspiracy theory, that has been thoroughly debunked dozens of times since the very start of the Covid-19 pandemic, as being just as likely as it being a natural origin, and that its "still up for scientific debate" you do actual serious harm by spreading that misinformation.  I have lost a lot of respect for the team due to this stance and hope you can put effort in to make your position better reflect the scientific consensus.
I enjoy your videos but this one is hyperbole.
Nothing ever is good or bad, but thought makes it so
So what you're telling me is to start (computer)virus bomb all open source repositories and keep doing it forever and make the killing of biologists in general and virologists in particular de facto self defense no matter the circumstances.
Listen I’m no supporter of him obviously but the unabomber talked about this in his book and I think he may have been right yikes
China lied millions died.
Americans refused to wear masks despite millions dieing as a result. I think if anything worse than c19 happens, the United States will be the reason for human extinction
Bullet point 3 - destroy - reminds me of Subnautica - wherein the precursors were studying a lethal waterborne bacterium. When a containment breach occured? All samples were killed and sterilized to limit the spread. And that's how we should be handling our biological data - sterilizing any pathogens after we've understood them.
Even if we carry out those 3 precautions, 1st 500 to 1000 infected would die anyway and if this become frequent no matter how technological advanced we get many people will suffer. Last decade was good like from 2005 to 2019 today everything is scary.
every argument of these statements can be applied to AI. nowdays there is a big debate arround ai safety and every arrow points in the direction of the creation of a control organization and regulation on what is public in the matter. AI was accelerate its growth in the last 10 years thanks of the nature of open research papers, open code and the advances in hardware. If you control how, what an who is capable of studyng and making ai without a degree, a company or a university backing up the rapid progress that we  as humans are making will be stopped and whorse than that we are losing the freedom of choice and decition because a organzation with a agenda can cut our access to the information (or if you are a simple human with curiosity and no degreee or company backing you up they can just ignore you) and letting ony a few big actors have the capability of testing and creating the next new tecnology. Even worse because of the secrecy public scrutiny will be harder.
NEW BATSHIT VIRUS DISCOVERED is crazy 4:45
As a person who struggles to open a can of beans without accidentally launching them into orbit, I can confidently say that the most dangerous weapon is not nuclear—it's my grandma's wooden spoon when she catches me raiding her cookie jar
Anyone play that system shock remake that came out a few weeks ago?
This video is proudly sponsored by Pfizer and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
It's not really a good look for Kurzgesagt to post a video sponsored by Open Philantrophy that to a degree argues for a further restriction of science, especially considering their recent scandals. I think we all agree that unfettered science is dangerous at worst, but scaring the general public about the biotechnological revolution when so much good could be done from an open system of data just feels irresponsible.
Dangerous for who?,for the world and every multicelular being is nuclear weapon they can wipe life with ease,for human it is still nuclear bio weapons and dangerous for the stock market
Resident Evil?! 😳
Another new thing to worry about this week. Just stack it on top of the others with AI taking jobs and the recession.
Maybe like and this is going to sound really weird like deadly weapons of the firearm variety maybe you should have a license in order to procure the information on a virus because they are potentially quite Lethal Weapon at the very least a minimum age requirement should be in place for handling these kinds of dangerous bacteria
enough people have talked about how this feels like an ad to paywall information inb the name of hazard but  i want to talk about where is the intro??
I think I'm beginning to understand the world's enthusiasm for lockdowns. Covid was a trial run for the real killer virus.
It's already been confirmed that the coronavirus was the cause of a lab leak come on now it's not speculation anymore.
Step 1)  Stop illegal gain of function research in Chinese labs (which is funded by US taxpayers)  Step 2)  Hold China accountable for their lab leak which killed millions of people…
If the catalogued viruses came from scientists then the creator or the person that discovered it might have made a cure for it already or even without cure the person has the same virus and can experiment on it for a cure incase if someone buys it and unleashes it. But as the video said, whats dangerous is making new viruses out of the old ones
This one feels out of touch. I liked you guys more when you explained the world and didn't tell me what to support or dislike. Please try to have an open mind on debatable topics and explain them from a neutral point of view. Like you used to.
Cough* Cov- cough* vid
4:45 nice
I absolutely love the umbrella corp logo on that building! Amazing detail lol, keep it up
Yet....we cant even solve our homeless and people starving problem. Make it make sense....
CHINA! ;D
They talk like the Covid vaccine was good lol
Not much debate after decoding coronavirus it was found to have unatural combination. Aka made in a lab.
7:26
6:00 nuclear weapons are not the same as biological ones, at all, in any way. The only reason it works at all to limit nuclear weapons from being built in a garage, is that you need the slow arduous complicated process of refining the uranium. Thats why it isnt easily accessible, NOT because the knowledge isnt out there. You can google how a nuclear bomb is built. The reason biological dangers isnt possible to regulate, is because its not possible to enforce, it does NOT require hundreds of millions of dollars in big facilities to slowly refine uranium. And it does NOT show up on radiological sensors even when being transported.
Governments worried about 3D printed guns, meanwhile someone is cooking up a smallpox-herpes-polio super virus in their garage lab...
looks like the biggest danger here is allowing for a positive feedback loop to be established between the makers of the cures and the creators of the desease. The best thing to do is minimize profit potential of this enevidability.
c19 made in lab not in bat
Anyone had that  *Are u watching a kurzgesagt video ?*
Crazy to think that one single contagious prion would wipe all of us out.
NileRed when the creating viruses in backyard part:  *sweats nervously* NileRed when the creating bombs in your backyard part: *sweating so very intesyfies*
You're ignoring that the viruses are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to weapons applications excuse me but the tyrannous from 40K should give you an idea about what I'm talking about
kurzgesagt swore? caught in 4k? getting cancelled by twitter?
bring back the ducks, mo offence to the art team but somethigns creepy and weird about these humans, and you cant go wrong with the ducks.
This has been my biggest existential fear for decades. Kids making particle accelerators, labs trying to build a fkn SUN on Earth, so many things could end us but I'm sure it'll be some dude in a garage growing bacteria.
didn't love that this video seemed to skim over the lack of structured, international response to the pandemic...it's not simply that there weren't enough vaccines to go around, it's that corporate interests withheld it from governments, that governments refused to shut down and "cripple" the economy when in fact the lack of a centralized shut down contributed to prolonging measures down the line...it was a complete shit show. disappointed that the profit motive is often excluded in calculations like these.
After you said the words, “up for debate” on the lab leak, I dont  have that problem taking you guys too seriously anymore 😅
Project Lazarus
3:33 We know bro come on... It was literally in the news last week, they found the documents.. they have the testimonies... Bro... it was a lab leak and you know it.
I still think human shouldn't play being God especially unskilled people
I was going to say, “wow this feels a lot like their garbage fear mongering nuclear videos” and then they just went and brought that up too 🤣
I loved that umbrella corp. reference from R.E. at 3:48
nuclear proliferation could be handled because of its literal physicality, whereas this "Problem" is more akin to piracy, its just information, and information spread cant be stopped, instead we should focus on raising the standard of living everywhere and developing a moral code that somehow prevents individuals from ending civilization, this is an inevitability, tech is a lever, an infinitely growing one, at some point every individual will be singlehandedly capable of ending humanity, and we'll have to live with that
"we still don't know if it came from nature or...." bruh LMAO
The first thing i imagined was Umbrella Corporation and T virus
Cold Plasma Jets can be also be used to kill microbes, relatively cheap to use
I'd no idea that random people could buy this stuff but now my take is the following: QUICK EVERYONE LET'S DO THE SUPER-AIDS-FLU AND ASK HUMANITY FOR A RANSOM LMAO   A ransom of... 1 million dollars! * Dr. Evil noises *
Guy sneezing on the other guy on the bus is probably about to get punched in the mouth
Most dangerous weapons is us
Can't wait to play plague inc. in real life
awesome video as always. One suggestion, I think it's time to transition to 4K videos, 1080p starts to show pixelated on 2K monitor here... :)
U FORGOT DA FACES
i less than three scaremongering
The shot is not a vaccine… it’s an MRNA booster…  It’s doesn’t make you immune to the virus like all ACTUAL vaccines do…
its amazing how technology has progressed. since scientists found a vaccine to an unknown virus for example covid19, why they dont develop a vaccine for HIV/AIDS for example?
"New batshit virus discovered"
"Imagine that your local repair shop would be able to build a pristine iPhone 11 from parts lying around." BAHAHA LMAO that is literally 500,000% IMPOSSIBLE. Apple would never allow it. Even if someone managed to do it, Apple would make them and 15 generations of theirs sl@ves to Apple until the measly sum of 5 quadrilllion dollars was worked off.
Nothing better to end the day than to listen to possible world ending scenarios with cute animations.
One good thing about the bio bomb is that mutually assured destruction is built right in. If you want to create a virus deadly enough to kill millions of people, there's no way to contain it to only your enemies. Even if you created a vaccine for your side secretly before you release the virus, it won't work perfectly and the virus could mutate out of your control quickly after it leaves lab conditions.  So it isn't really an attractive weapon for a country like China for example. For someone to use this biotechnology purposely as a weapon, their purpose would have to be just to hurt as many people as possible while being fine with dying alongside everyone else. That cuts the number of people actually interested in the bioweapon way down.

This was one of the weaker Videos of you Guys
Props for having the integrity to say lab leak was a potential cause for covid. Now if only you guys would stop suckin the d!ck of big pharma...
Pugs, the apex of human breeding efforts! 🫠
I wish they made a video about the JWST
0:55 HAHAHA Its not 2020 anymore, its 2023. We've known full well that the entire sequence of the virus was being worked on in Wuhan. Thats why we had the sequencing done already. It wasnt done from scratch in weeks.
Another awsome and interesting  😊video❤
Ah, uh... Little off topic here, but can we get the bacteriophage in silicone 😅 Hadn't seen the end yet, guess it wasn't really off topic 😂
Come on, y’all been listening to Eric Weinstein
I like the hint to the Umbrella Corporation :D
Who gets to decide what is "dangerous" knowledge? This kind of thinking leads to authoritarianism. As somebody who hopes to see a technological singularity before my frail flesh fails me, i would rather we not limit information and science more than it already is.  It's just such a slippery slope to label things dangerous. Especially since the danger comes not from the knowledge and the sciences, but from the people. PEOPLE are dangerous. Science is not.
7:26 ඞ
Einstein was so right. "Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind."
the mastery of extremes will take a long time...
I am now more afraid of Biotech than what AI can potentially do to this world!
7:26 💀
You already lost me when you claimed that that mRNA stuff is a vaccine. It's not. It uses the cells of the body to produce the vaccine. Big difference.
Don’t worry highly skilled jobs will also be automated. While everyone laughs at McDonald’s workers telling them their jobs will be replaced by robots.
He says amongus at 7:26
Where intro?
"Controling Biology" therefore nature, is the disgustingly shortsighted idea that get's us in trouble in the first place. Sorry, naive at best
9:30 we all make mistakes
Great video
"The last of your so-called World Wars."  "Yes, the Eugenics Wars of the late 90s."
Amazing video. Back in college I did an essay about biotechnology, also discusing its potential for good and bad, and how It isn't inherently either, it's just a tool that we choose how to use. I concluded that what we need in a world where biotech's everywhere is regulation, not unlike what you indicate at the end of the video. So yeah, happy to see I wasn't far off with the essay
I’m a biologist, that map of evolution chart hangs in my bedroom. It’s such a great infographic and packs so much information. A perfect conversation piece for my field. ❤
Now we just have to figure out how to make a virus that's only deadly to billionaires
+
The most dangerous weapons leak from a lab, like covid.
Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.  How much propaganda can you spot??
Sorry, the most dangerous weapon were creating is weather havoc through climate change. Just wait.
Great video, but Am I the only one that misses the birds doing the stuff in the videos? 😅
It’s almost certain it came from American tax payer funded research led by faucchi in the wuhan lab.  But yeah, the sponsorship by gates foundation probably prohibits you from stating facts about the origins bc he’s one of the most heavily invested individuals, holding shares in all vax manufacturing companies until he sold most of his shares of shortly before rumors about side effects became common knowledge and stocks plummeted
I'd love to see more about the DUAL USE RESEARCH OF CONCERN (DURC), and the probability of bioterrorism at a global scale.
Progress on human DNA is only using 3 billions dollars , so sad, back then not much people care
Doomer video.   400 nuclear power stations is a pitiful number and gross waste of potential, that only extends the use of antiquated and toxic carbon fuels. Advocating for restriction of knowledge I didn't really expect from you guys, even if it can be considered wise in a vacuum, could just further "have and have nots" just like Nuclear technology, which is heavily gated, and **demonized.**  Not even considering the nuclear weapon issues. Which is a different topic which you tried to tie in here, having observation stations and contingencies is good... the issues you listed are indeed possible! And I would much more interested in solutions with increased openness!
Make a science backpack. Please 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
6:44 Doctor Bombastic's Bomb Tutorial 💀
4:48 ah, yes. Plague Inc.
So you're not gonna talk about the side effects of the corrupt covid vaccine? Oh wait, this was a paid video so the truth isnt gonna be said.
We're still pretending we don't know where COVID came from??
This video has a weirdly anti-freedom-of-knowledge message. This knowledge absolutely needs to stay free and available to anyone. You still need a massive amount of skill and experience to use this knowledge, so no, not just anybody can cook up a mega-virus in their backyard. You seriously underestimate the effort, time, and skill that that would take. I have a bachelors in genetics and a PhD in molecular biology, and that would still be quite a tall order for me. Someone without that kind of education wouldn’t even know where to begin.
Anybody wanna know how to recreate the „the last of us“ fungus? In theory it’s easy, I just don’t have the experience and equipment to manipulate a Genom, but the theory of which parts you have to exchange for something else is pretty easy to do. For example, you can add parts of the dermatophytes Genom for making it resistible against humans, but I would recommend parts of the vaginal thrush Genom for that, due to is being more resistant to heat. We can also use that fungus again for spreading, due to it being related to yeast, so we could infect supermarket yeast globally with our manipulated version of the cordyceps unilateralis. Because the fungi we are using only work on humans with weakened immune system, I would run a phase in which we infect humans and hope for mutations making the cordyceps better in infecting and fighting humans. We should also figure out how to say the fungus that it is different muscle and nerve tissue he has to control, than in insects. The last problem to tackle would be to make it adopt onto biological male bodies, due to the used fungi genom being exclusive to biological female bodies (it’s a fungus which infects the female reproductive organs), but we can use a very similar fungus for that, which is also related to yeast fungi and infects the male reproductive organs and is additionally able to spread the the mouth (useful for the biting other people for spreading shit) and the digestive tract.
i love censorship! i love increasing the powers of states! i love placing artificial restraints on human progress!  kurzgesagt, shame upon thee. this is the most unabated fearmongering ive ever seen on the channel and it serves only to harm human progress, whose source is freedom of information.
Oh we'll be fine, only a couple million of us will die but everything will be super other than that! Those who are happy about that don't ever realize the one of those deaths would likely be their own.
"Let's restrict information, for the greater good!" - Every despot ever. One of the reasons we reacted as quickly as we did do Covid-19 is that we DIDN'T restrict this information. If we followed bullet point one on this list, we'd still be in the middle of a pandemic, with a vaccine still months, or years away.
I can't wait for someone to put 3:15 in a kurzegstagt out of context compilation
Anybody know the art style used in this video? Thanks!
Just like that your credibility went down the toilet because the so called "vaccine" was causing more people to come down with covid-19 not prevent it from spreading if anything it most likely contributed to the spread of covid-19.
"The world just witnessed how fast the novel coronavirus just spread. We still don't know if it came from nature or if it was an accidental leak from a lab working with coronaviruses. That's still subject to scientific debate".    I'm gonna need a source on that one.   Virologists around the world have studied COVID-19 and its variants extensively. The consensus is that it wasn't man made. There have been plenty of news reports of the opposite, a shitload of fearmongering and consequently an enormous amount of doubt thrown into the mix, but the scientific community has remained steadfast that it wasn't man made or released from a lab.
Lmao the add got me like 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳🗣️
This video just skips over the whole prevalence of corporate greed thing.
Yeah let’s restrict access so only BiG Pharma and the elites have access. People stop trading freedom for the illusion of safety please ffs.
BS! All that "open sharing" is a lie, almost all science papers are behind obscene paywalls, so this video is completely out of touch with reality. No teenagers can do anything dangerous with germs in their basements, because they simply can't afford to come anywhere close to the tech and knowledge needed for it.
So the T virus is possible 😂
Where are the birds?
I truly believe our biggest next step would be biological solar panels some sort of goo / plant  that can turn solar energy into electrical energy, and then be able to grow this goo/plant and maintain relatively cheaply, then within theory be able to get electricity from everywhere way cheaper that haveing to assemble actual solar panels when it would just grow itself,
Ah yes, my dose of fear mongering is here again, time for me to think about how scared i should be of people doing things without absolute supervision at all times.
Wuhan lab
there is no way ads saying that they kbow that im wacthing kurzerkuaz (how to spell) video
Since i voluntary mandatory got second covid vaccine, i feel like i am out of body, brain fog, tired. Thanks scientists.
Y’all use to be a good channel now you’re just politically bias. It’s not open for debate it came from a lab in China. The vaccines are not tested enough that’s another fact. Y’all went down hill it’s sad to see
Why scientist still can't make vaccine for HIV AIDS who are stopping them
Where is the intro?
6:48 Umbrella corp. oh noes
Who else noticed the "batsh*t virus" on the book at 4:47 ?
The ad 💀
How about banning gain of function research to prevent unnecessary lab leaks? Read Matt Ridley's book Viral. Also, read the recent article from the Washington post about the earliest COVID cases in China. The cons of gain of function research outweigh the pros. Lab leaks happen (by mistake). If the purpose of such research is to prevent a pandemic, then consider the pandemic we just had. How did it work out? At the very least, increasing security protocols to maybe reduce the risk of accidental lab leaks makes sense. The issue became so politicized. It should be studied and remembered as a prime example of a break down in scientific integrity. Instead, most mainstream news and the most prominent scientific journals treat the lab leak hypothesis as a "conspiracy" theory. It's not. Saying something was accidentally released is not saying there was a conspiracy. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I'm not a racist against Chinese people and I got my COVID vaccine as soon as i could. I just value honesty and exploring where the evidence takes you.
This is the consequence of making people too big brain
Is science of any value? I think a power to do something is of value. Whether the result is a good thing or a bad thing depends on how it is used, but the power is a value. ... "To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven. The same key opends the gates of hell." And so it is with cience.  fragment of "The Meaning Of It All" by Richard Feynman.
Disagree. This video came with the intent to privatize and making open information to public seems bad.
The funny thing is, there was a kid who created a nuclear reactor in his backyard. So creating a nuclear bomb isn't far off
Thanks for the idea kurzgesagt! Excited to try these new bio weapons in the near future.
4:43 Those are some slow clap worthy puns! XD
Bro who is going to build a nuclear bomb in their backyard💀
One more thing we can do to stop new pandemics:  Stop the irresponsible and cataclysmic clearing of land for farming, which disrupts habitats of animals that serve as reservoirs for potential zoonotic diseases and exposes them to humans.   We need to start acting, not simply reacting. Prevent the problems, not just scramble to fix them.
I wonder if anything bad would happen if we shot all of our trash into the sun. I guess the whole Kessler Syndrome thing, but I'm not a scientist.
Kurzgesagt just forgot the intro.....
Imagine all the secret bio labs that exist in the world where we have no idea what they are working on. They can’t share their results with academia out of fear that someone could replicate them and release it to the public. All I have to say is I hope it’s worth it
Just another fantastic video you created there. Also, kudos to you taking the criticism of your evolutionary poster so seriously. Other companies might just have shrugged it over when people complained, but you took it all serious and worked over it. You truly take everything you do super serious and I wanted to congratulate you for that.
7 million people perished seems to be a small number than the truth
Funded by Open Society ie George Soros ,thank you for not hiding the sponsor .
:O
"What about the Lysine Contingency? We could put that into effect?"
Le Virus... Le killed people 😮😮😮
yes
my mother studied the coronavirus in a virology institute, and she says that coronavirus is actually likely came from a lab, as it contained pieces of DNA of other viruses (for example: HIV's immuno-suppresion system), and it does look like it was literally engineered to be as infectuous as possible
The America will the leading manufacturers of bio weapons, as they are number one in weapon development
What made you guys reconsider your stance on the deadliness of covid-19? A year ago it was the worst thing to happen to humanity and seemed like a scare tactic to get people to take the vaccine.
You cannot just order dangerous DNA or virus strains. It has to be from an account held by your university/lab, which will have been vetted beforehand, and they in turn will have vetted you.
I couldn't help but notice something is amiss with the narration. It feels kinda rushed as compared to other videos.
The 7,000,000 deaths I feel is a very inflated number. I've heard several reports that hospitals were marking almost any deaths at the time as a corona virus death. One I heard recently was a man dying in a motorcycle accident and he was marked a corona death. A friend told me one of his relatives had a heart attack, was admitted to a hospital, died, and he was marked a corona death. I don't trust that corona death count.
The animation in this video is breathtaking!! You all at Kurzgesagt are fantastic!!
Dude the ad😭 (im watching on my cellphone)
Gonna be the new randsomware... Pay us 5 bitcoin to get the vaccine for the virus we just infected your country with.
what a HUGE amount of disinformation. Shame, this channel used to be good. Maybe this will be one of those videos they retract and apologize for.  EDIT: they just changed things, PROVING how ludacris this channels disinformation is again!
How much did gates pay for this one?
Kurzgesagt be like: “let’s limit the free sharing of knowledge and tools so that governments and corporations can have total dominion on yet another field”  Daym these shills just keep pumping out propaganda
Nice to see that the company logo you used to symbolize "bad" biotech companies is one from a movie/game series that did exactly what your warning was about: creating deadly/really dangerous viruses and releasing them into the wild ;)
“New Batshit Virus Discovered” is a wild headline 😂😂
There is a reason why biowarfare is considered a warcrime lol
Basically benefits immortality possibility Extinction.
The part about building an iphone out of spare parts just needed an Apple attorney walking into the room in the background holding a cease and desist letter.
Babe, wake up, new Kurzgesagt just dropped.
Crazy that I could just order a super virus online and kill millions
Instead of creating Franken-seeds that can grow in extreme conditions due to climate change, how about trying to remedy the pollution that large corporations spew out into the atmosphere on a daily basis? Just a thought.
Covid was a really bad example to use in this. A lot of the research that went into making the inoculations (you have to constantly get a shot so it isn't a vaccine by the definition of a vaccine prior to 2019) came from the 2015 reports on the virus. As it was originally published in a Chinese medical journal, that was then swiftly taken down, but not removed everywhere and all the research leading to the 2015 journal was still available too. So it wasn't some sudden making of the inoculations, they had years upon years of research into it. For how much time they had it was actually really slow for how long it took them.
Disregarding the tremendous danger highlighted, the future is just so cool
What can happen does happen. When this becomes commonplace, that you can build the super bio “nuke” weapon, we are done, whether it’s “revenge” over ruby ridge, waco type scenario, or religious bs, identity politics, terrorism, we’re screwed.
What I love about science is how the different fields of it can contribute to one another to increase progress or offer a solution.
Interesting you guys didn't suggest the covid virus was released intentionally. that is always a possibility. china is ruthless when it comes to suppressing its people. Not saying that did happen, but its definitely something people should consider.
I'm currently reading The Plague and the rats animation unnerved me a lot.
C 1 Nine was already analyzed at woooohan before it was released
7:26😱
Hi
You'd really think the "newest first" comments of a Kurzgesagt video would be smarter, clearly not.
It's nice to see a video like this and not see the comments filled with "gain of function", "hoax", vaccine denials, and the like that are found with videos and articles on similar topics. It really makes me appreciate the quality of your viewers. 👍
The Covid lab leak killed more people than nukes, and it is just the beginning
Good, Next i need a dose of existential crisis
Im gonna disagree with you here. Any information that can't be shared with humanity at large shouldn't be in the hands of anyone at all. Governing bodies are made up of people and are subject to the same corruption as any other group of people. Funny enough, you can in fact make a nuclear bomb in your backyard. The information to do so is freely available and the materials are difficult to get, but attainable. Not to mention conventional bombs which can be made in less than a week with common materials and information freely available on the internet. Meanwhile, the vast majority of innocent people killed with explosives aroubd the world are killed by various government and law enforcement agencies. In short, i trust Bob the weekend scientist with "dangerous information" much more than any government or organization. Information, being an integral part of the human condition, should be spread freely and celebrated. The good will always outweigh the bad.
Now add AI
I can’t help but think that this video has a hidden agenda….
Nice
Welcome to Kurzgesagt’s one more thing to worry about video
hi i love you
Umbrella eh?
I first heard about these dangers BEFORE the covid pandemic.. and nothings been done about it.. we truly live in an idiocracy
as if thermofisher lets everyone order dna from anyone lol
Loved the resident evil reference with the umbrella logo 😂
I did read this hilariously bad book called "101 things you shouldn't know how to do" and it had things in it like how to build a nuke, how to start a coup, how to build a radio from household items, how to intercept plane communications etc. It was a gift by my nan I think but I don't think she looked what was inside it 😂 she bought it from a charity shop
Thanks for the information, I will be busy for the next few days building a superbug in my backyard
This is why there must be more cooperation between responsible government abd businesses, otherwise irresponsible governments and shady businesses might let terrible disaster happen in the name of personal gainings.
ah yes covid 19
As a molecular biologist, seeing this made me want to cry.  In essence:   "here is a fear mongering video that will make you nervous about things you don't understand and how easy it is to do (actually... its still hard to do and it takes a group of people a lot of effort to get anything right)"  Then...  "And here is a list of unreasonable requests that will halt all lab work in the field for those fears"  Honestly. Making a virus will take either one crazy guy 4 years to do and then it'll probably fail. Or a team a few months.  Either way, people will likely notice and you'll need a bunch of good guys to counteract it.   Its like hackers in the 90s. The evil geniuses of the world will try regardless, so your only hope is to have them outnumbered by a 100 good guys.
The outro music makes me feel like I am on another world  It makes me emotional I don't know why
At 5:02, Journal of viral medicology, Viral of medical Journology, Medal of journical virology I also love easter eggs like Dr. Clone, Stars trek and sneeze, Dr. Bombastic's bomb tutorial  You are geniuses.
>Wherever the last pandemic came from  LMAO
i think if you let this knowledge to be free is very important, yes i know there some bad people and also good people also, take for example why linux is not affect by virus while microsoft does but if you let few to people to control they will use for their own advantage
magine if nilered discover that video ':/ (go to mars)
2:40 narrator said a swear word 😭  Also now that I have your attention, long-term patents on medicine by large companies like Pfizer are one of the worst things that ever happened to humanity. Lobby your politicians and write letters asking to shorten their length and prevent companies from extending their patents through court litigation.
The amount of gas lighting still being used around covid is crazy
It feels like this channel has turned into nothing more than speculative fear porn...
Covid happen so the this “progress” can keep going.
"A relatively mild virus"  "Didn't cause serious disease in most people,"  "We don't know if it occurred naturally or came from a lab studying coronaviruses."  All statements that would have gotten you banned from most of the internet 1 and a half years ago, despite those being just as known and as true back then as they are now. I'm glad we are out of the covid hysteria and can now look back rationally.
XD Oh yes, we truely arent sure where Corona came from. Never mind all the first cases came from a city with a biolab working on corona viruses. Still gotta tow that political line.
If we wanted to stop individuals killing tons of individuals with things they can keep in their basement, we would have passed gun control laws decades ago.
Thank you for existing  Amazing channel, amazing content ❤
I think we should secure, contain and protect.
The sheer outflow and inflow of information to individual humans in our society is staggering, and hopefully, this trend exponentially continues.
If you ever really wanna scare yourself on this topic read The Demon In The Freezer. It's about how scientists discovered and helped contain and eradicate small pox, as well as speculating about how easy it would be to create a new deadly virus that could be used in biowarfare... it's really well written and utterly bone-chilling :P
Can't wait for COVID-24. Then 25. Then 26.
7:26
The most powerful weapon today is social media and the fear of voicing unpopular opnions.
7:26
6:48 This is a Resident Evil reference? In a next video can you talk about Bio-weapons?
Y'all should think about doing a video on the COVID vaccine side effects - what were they, how many people did they impact, what safety checks existed, and overall benefits & drawbacks. It needs to be definitive and authoritative. People's fundamental trust in science is eroding very quickly and this will be a focal point of the upcoming American elections next year.
They already knew the structure of COVID-19 as it was created using known DNA sequences that produce certain functionality from other viruses such as SARS (0.92), MERS (0.89) and Ebola (0.78) numbers being Cosine similarity-based analysis between COVID-19 and those. Said functionality sequences are well known amongst virologists and are frequently copied and pasted when creating new viruses.  You can think of them as being analogous to functions in programming. Within COVID-19 several DNA sequences that correspond to known functions were identical in their entirety, which would be statistically impossible to happen naturally.
I don't know if I agree with this one... a lot of german doom and gloom got into it. The open sharing and collaberation of the scientific community advances science at an unprecidented rate. The loss of shuting this community would be astronomic, millions would die as a result of lack of advancement in science.
This is why biotech waste goes into glued boxes and is incinerated, and liquids with cells are pooled and chlorinated if there's any chance they are still alive. Even though most (GMO) cell lines wouldn't last a second in the harsh outside world :p
tell all this to china
You guys get that exposure to UV light sufficient to kill bacteria will cause sunburns, skin cancer, and blindness in humans right?
Nah, they've pretty much admitted that it came from a lab doing gain of function research illegally funded by the US.
👀Oh boys!
It shocks me how LITTLE of the United States dabbles in genetic engineering. It's LITERALLY the next arm rat race and they put up regulations so no one will advance it TOO MUCH. Meanwhile China has proven they have ignored all these regulations time and time again. Sooner or later someone's gonna have a strong enough grasp where they'll be able to exterminate any race they want. And unless the other rest of the world is just as advanced they won't have the knowledge to stop it in time. The only solution is RESEARCH AND KNOWLEDGE.
shilling for vaccine for your big pharma donors again?
YouTube Algorithm
wow, Kurzgesagt promoting the PROHIBITION of knowledge.  So sad this channel ended like this...
The CCP trying to wipe us all out but didn't know that Modern Medical engineering is decades more advanced than theirs.
Lest go new vid
"Where is all this sudden progress coming from" ... I'll tell you an FDA bypass that meant normal protocols could be ignored so long as Ivermectin et al was sufficiently demonised. Unsubscribed. What will you lot be saying ten years from now. What will your apology look like? It will not, must not be accepted, you have the ability to know the Nuremberg style crimes that are going on, and you will not open your eyes, will not speak. Cowards.
Interesting that no one ever mentions the biggest cause of death to ever exist, that being life itself and being brought into existence.
More focus on terapeutics Also. Like What kills virus? Virophage and virovore
Destroying all of humanity is bad, destroying life for ever (the nuclear option) is still worse. And lets not forget you could also release massive amount of plutonium  in the atmosphere, which will als be worse that a bio weapon.
I'm reminded of Warhammer 40K
Luckily I dont eat vegetables.
Isn't this the backstory of Tom Clancy's The Division
7:26 dont click on this timestamp, worst mistake of my life
yes but i think it's more important to keep this stuff open. the tracking idea doens't seam to bad but the whole reason that it's developing so quickly is because we are able to tell the kids in school "now make your own" the reas on it is going so fast is exactly because it's so comercilized and easy to get into. theres a fucking solo guy on yotube who cured his own lactose intolorants. sure bit of an extreme example (the thought emporium btw) but i mean that's the whole apeal. it's nova it's new and yoiu're able to get into it. i know that art is completly different as it isn't dangerous but look at how much incredible art is out there because people are able to get into it all on their own without expensive programs, same goes for game devolpment and movies. i geuss those are all non dangeous but still the prospect of a scientific field evolving so rapidly, that's super super cool. i mean how cool is it that theoretically i can look up on internet if there's some guy who offers to cut my finger open and putt a magnet in there to give me another sense (well it's not that extrme more of a novelty) but hta's super super cool!! it's cause that guy got to experiment, got to understand how to use substances to stimulate nerve growing how to get the body to accept the magnet! that's amazing!  tldr; if teh general public is able to do it. it has always poitned to massive developments. look at astrology (not the visco girl one) art, politics, starting your own company all of that, it's just a lot safer so i get why people would want it to be regulated but i feel like these regulation wil be way to much way to quickly and ruin th epotetnial it ahs to become a regular hobby. instead of "hey guys i made this artwork" "look guys i made a berry out of meat in my garage!"
It's not a proper swear but hearing the narrator say Crappy threw me for a moment 😂
Always loved the videos from @kurzgesagt, but some of them seems to follow an agenda, just like the gates foundation that they are sponsored, to reduce knowledge available and keep it exclusive for the big companies. I understood the risks the video pointed out, but keeping it closed won't mitigate the chance of someone with bad intentions to do some harm. I'd like to hear from the @thoughtemporium what he thinks of this.
As someone who is considering changing my intended major to biochemistry, this is a great video!
That Umbrella Corporation logo. Kurzgesagt topping the Easter egg game once again!
> Weird merch Why did I almost immediately come up with an idea of a black hole shaped fleshlight?
We aren't sure if COVID was from a lab leak in the same way as we aren't sure if Santa Claus is real.
Albert Wesker has entered the chat

Kurzgesagt: Humanity is doomed if scientists keep on sharing dangerous info that's easily accessible! Also Kurzgesagt: Here's how to build a virus in your backyard
all thanks to your overlord bill gates i guess?...
Learned nothing from this video, doesnt sayd anything scientific, jsut there is vaccines blah blah
4:46,  truly the batshit virus of all time
Vaccine was not ready. Stop peddling that lie.
Lmaoooo the evolution tree was hilarious
I was going to ask which idiots disliked this video. until I realised it's likely the anti-science, right-wing maga crowd
Is it me or does Kurzgesagt increased their hints towards vaccination recently ?
What if a terrorist get this and use it 🥵🥵🥵you can't imagine what will happen
6:33 "The reuslts weren't been perfect ... but We've been very succesful "   ..There are at least 10 LOST/MISSED Nuclear bombs out there somewhere.. 3 of the most insane people on the earth and dictators are armed with such power to destroy the entire world in an instant , an entire radicalist muslim nation has been armed with nuclear weapons.. successful my ass lol !
My first thought of was "Oh that's easy! All we have to do is have the government regula-" and that's as far as I got before I burst into a fit of laughter.
What are we living in a sci-fi movie or what?
Thank you Kurzgesagt team <3
Kurzgesagt shilling for the government to track and monitor anyone who might be _dangerously_ curious and scientifically intelligent is not a good look.
among us
These are starting to get more tabloidy, they were always a little sentationalist but I guess that's fine.
Where are the resources to purchase these virus making kits? I need to know for research purposes.
I closed this video at 1:03 when you started spouting bullshit propaganda. What a shame you're holding water to cover for the atrocities of tyrannical, oppressive regimes that unleashed a deadly virus on the planet.
Shadow Wizard Money Gang take notes.
The world going vegan and stopping animal agriculture is critical to reduce the vast majority of pandemics/virusses
All Tomorrows is getting more and more realistic as biotech gets better
Wth with the Data Time ad, guessing i'm watching kursgezagt
Is this going to be a "you are forbiden to have friends" like in Covid pandemic? It'll no use for me, I almost died from lonelyness-induced depression. So safe from die of Covid helped me nothing, deathrisk was equaly high np matter how much fight was done against Covid. (Quite similar to body imune system that sometimes does more harm than the dosease itself) So sad.  No matter how good the idea of banning info and chemical is, officials forget that most of garage scientists are NOT terorists, just want to have fun , hopefully without any harm. So even if this helps preventing people from die, the small-but-inavoidable suffering of being falsely acused of having bad intentions if your garagr looks to creepy is ALREADY a big sucess for the real terrorists. They not have even to actualy do something, and as you all saw in Covid pandemic, the psyhological and sometimes financial damage a pandemic does hurts sometimes almost as much as the fear of diing.
I remember when you were all gaslighting the origin of covid like all the spineless individuals.   It came from the Wuhan lab, the covid "vaccine" was a massive flop and the pandemic was used by authorities to implement a lot of weird stuff.
The general population may become an adversary to corporations' profits; an adversary worth eliminating. Then, a few may control the planet
The real danger is the US and EU government. This lab where covid might have come from was financed by the USA and China. Secrecy will only enable bad government actors to do even more harm.
Cure found: Don’t be human 🤖
As much as i love science and the unimaginable potential to reduce suffering and disease on this planet, i don't think we should advance in biotech / algorythm learning anymore for the time beeing. I don't see the human race equipped to deal with the potential of these technologies right now. We can't even band together and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, how are supposed to comprehend how much we can alter / destroy our enviroment with gene-editing or control the media and people in general with A.I. ?
Woooooow! The "unknown" coronavirus? I don't think I've been lied to so boldly yet this year.
Loving the resident evil reference with the umbrella corporation logo lol
Hi
1:21 Actually a 2023 phone can easily cost more than a 1999 PC.
Ok this is a good viedo  but just one thing, a person can't create a deadly virus in their backyard, the machine that prints DNA can do it for a couple hundred dollars, but it itself costs potentially millions, only big companies can afford them and they don't sell DNA to everybody, most companies ship ONLY to registered labs and even if they ship to normal people they still screen the DNA to see if it can create anything harmfull. It's way over the top to claim that a guy in a backyard can create a pandemic
Great video, as always the animation is getting better and better. i agree, nowadays biotech is whether capable to thrive the world or destroy it completely and the governments are responsable to address it
I am not sure that I agree with your "security through obscurity" suggestion. As far as I can remember, this is the first time I disagree with one of your conclusions. Advantages of knowledge sharing far outweigh the dangers. In bioweapons area (as with all WMD), the true villains are governments, not a lone lunatic with a garage lab, or some nefarious terrorists.
he said among us 😂
<3
kovid leaked from one of these labs why even pretend anymore?
Biology is much more important than physics 🙃  Because it will help our day to day life  No hate for physics
Question!    Why not just make a vaccine for the viruses as they mutate?
Yes we do know the origins of c19. It was man-made and released by China intentionally. That's why they tore down thr biolab when the USA wanted to investigate it. Pay attention.
The advance will come from many working to control the technology. Not just a few mad scientists. Not just a few well meaning scientists either.
If the HIV virus came at covid 19 times we would have a vaccine this time, tells you how easy and corrupt the world is today
Can you make a video around Betelgeuse might becoming a possible supernova in the next decades? Some scientific reports came out around it.
so... catgirls soon?
Alternative title : how to create a bomb
Nah, bioediting needs to be publicly available, like smartphones, and considered a right. Let's be real, with bioediting, who'd need a hospital ever again? Free healthcare, instantly available.
As someone actually working in biotech who also has a home lab it’s not that easy. Most organisms aren’t available to purchase especially pathogens. As for DNA sequences it is monitored and I’ve personally been called by the FBI WMD directorate and the International gene synthesis consortium when they were checking up on what I was buying even though it wasn’t pathogenic. So there are public and private watchdogs on all this stuff, plus making and testing novel viruses isn’t as easy as this video makes it seem. Especially if you need a lot of human test subjects. If you want to know where the biological super weapons will come from it’s rogue states like North Korea. They have the money, the human test subjects, the ability to hide what they are doing and leaders crazy enough to try it.   Also a group of biohackers working with biotech at home made and tested the first successful Covid vaccine months before any corporation and published all their methods and results online. If Covid had been a much worse virus and especially if it’s delivery had been weaponized by targeting government infrastructure like the CDC and the FDA. They might have been the only ones to actually make a working vaccine. Mostly because biohackers are decentralized and can work a lot faster since there isn’t any bureaucracy and they tend to test things on themselves.   There is a very real possible scenario where a state makes a biological WMD and deploys it strategically crippling the corporate and government infrastructure leaving only a decentralized network of citizen scientists to respond.   Let’s not regulate them out of existence please.   Edit - in reply to the comments saying how can biohackers make a vaccine if they can’t make a super plague. Vaccines are much easier, the first vaccine was made in 1796, it’s not remotely the same scale of work. It’s the difference in tech and infrastructure that you would need is the same as what you’d need to go from making a toy robot in your garage as a hobby and making an army of military robots.   Vaccines are just a lot easier to make than WMDs because they are old and simple technology that works with the amazing power of your immune system where plagues have to work against that power.
I got a good topic for the next video: Where are the Flying Cars?  You can talk about the motivations, costs, and implications on them and why the concept never really kicked on yet!
"Imagine that your local Computer Repair shop could build a pristine iPhone 11 with just the parts lying around" You can find many videos of tourists visiting Shenzen's markets, buying parts required for <insert name of cutting edge smartphone>, and assembling it in the local McDonalds.
8:06 UV germicidal lamps are not particularly good for humans either. there are ways around it, but
Hmmm.  Lab in Wutan experimenting with corona viruses and apparently it came from a food market.   Bit like saying that nukes come from hardware stores
Let the arms race begin. (Continue?) I don't know about you but I'm rooting for the combined scientific community instead of the malicious actors
Don't forget about stuff in the ice
Countermeasures, because we all know how well people react to being told to wear a mask and get vaccinated. The unfortunate truth is that no amount of preparation can account for the incredulity the Information Age has created.
Wow, another mind-blowing video from Kurzgesagt! Their ability to tackle complex topics in such a clear and engaging way is truly impressive. This video on "The Most Dangerous Weapon is NOT Nuclear" is a perfect example. It's fascinating to learn about the potential risks and devastating consequences of emerging technologies. We need more awareness and discussions on this subject to ensure a responsible and secure future for humanity. Thank you, Kurzgesagt, for always expanding our knowledge and making us think deeper. Keep up the amazing work! 👏🌍
That example with the iphone is absolutely true, if only because it was an apple product in particular.
1:17 "And knowledge on how to do impressive things spread freely."  That's why I think patents are bad. We should share knowledge so others can add to it, improve it, and make progress faster and cheaper.
Thank you for inventing the good shit! For ME to use when I'm old and decrepit old man!!
The most Dangerous weapon is a soldier with his rifle. You did not know about war.
Wow you really think the c19 vax was safe and effective? Reported for misinformation.
We love seeing this garbage channel fear mongering everyone
If that knowledge is not shared, then we cannot develop counter measures against weaponised viruses allowing the first actor to develop such a virus have horrifying power.
7:26 they said the funny
Challenging others' scientific knowledge and beliefs only help everyone understand everything alot better! We're glad it was able to help you guys flourish and I also hope your resources continue to innovate and help people young and old understand the science that many think is too complex to get into
Is this another trailer sponsored by Bill Gates?
Not surprising, if we discover a new technology, the government will try to use it for warfare.
Using cheap and readily available biotech, I created a sentient blancmange in my garage. Currently teaching it to play tennis.
Human GMOs are another defense.  Like how your dog can't catch your cold, genetically segmenting the population can limit the spread of an illness.
HE SAID AMONG US 7:26
I feel like the message at the end of the video undermines a lot the sharing on learning philosophy this channel always held dear, you just said that openly sharing access to biology has led to breakthroughs and more inovation to the field! And now you propose to restrict it? The 3 option "develop better tools to handle future outbreaks" seems more fitting to me...
fun fact: russia has bio weapon bombs with deadly versions of anthrax in them  although i personally think the COVID pandemic was blown WAY out of proportion, bio weaponry is one of the main reasons that we could perish, so it's good that this is being spread more to the public, and ideas are being proposed
wether covid came from a lab in wuhan china or an animal is not a scientific question! laughable.
7:26 sus
Who decides what people are allowed to have the deadly virus information? The only nuclear bombs ever detonated were over city’s full of civilians, dropped by the entity responsible for deciding who got access to nuclear material.
You can't, just CAN'T do serious biotechnology like genetic editing in you backyard. Instruments needs specialized people behind it even if they are relatively cheap, and no, not everyone could do that. Experieced people are needed to read analysis because isn't always true anything an analytical instrument gives as result makes sense. And even if it's possible to produce anything viable AND dangerous (and this is rare because it's how life works) probably isn't going to go anywhere because... well, making a virus to survive it's difficult, needs specific cultures that needs specific environments, instruments, and way to work. Then it needs specific animal to replicate and keeping experimental animal is anything but difficult and then there is storage, erroneous storage conditions ruins the work of entire specialized labs JUST now, go figure "backyard people"... sorry, this video might be of high quality in other respects but not much scientifically.  The comparison between Nuclear and biological dangers is so much a bad one I don't know even where to start.  Biological surveillance at population center level is already going on now, it's how we catched coronavirus in so short time.  Limiting access to knowledge is what actually SAVED us in the last pandemic because anything got shared and was shared before. Each research lab already have tools, instrument and knowledge to study or just diagnose Coronavirus and it's variants. And it would be never possible without that. The Exact moment when we start to limit the sharing of biological knowledge, tools  and experiences we are posing to be hit with a pandemic we CAN'T resolve so easily... because as worst as it was the impact of Corona was way less than what could be BECAUSE of free access to research.
Also it's important to remember that Covid didn't emerge out of thin air. People have to think critically about it. Pandemic, economic crises, massive inflation, all of them had been planned many years before to reach one goal for few people or 1 group of some people

Great video Kurtsgesagt, but I wouldn't call pugs an example of genetic mastery lol Keep up the good work guys!
Such a naive way of looking at it.  "All we have to do is these three things and we'll be fine".  Meanwhile people kill each other over toilet-paper. All people are "the wrong people".
HE SAID AMONGUS AAAAAAHHHHHH
And we have the permafrost melting which can have diseases that were dormant for thousands of years now suddenly making a comeback.
didn't the soviet union try this?
lets be real here someone will make a zombie virus or plague in the next 100 years
I dont have a Backyard.... guess I cant create a deadly virus....
Humans are the only species that can destroy themselves 😂
Don't obfuscate, you gates-funded media machine, the lab leak theory's being swept under the rug by legacy media as we speak even though it's the most likely candidate for the truth.
Misinformation
This very much seems like a propaganda video for some corporation
Brilliant video as always, and totally correct. Amazing how a little bit of sugar and a few tiny compounds  containing nitrogen, oxygen and a few phosphorus atoms can arrange themselves (nucleobases) into a structure that can bring life or if it they arrange themselves into a particularly infectious and deadly strain of Ebola, which is the virus I fear the most. I think some people would rather die of radiation poisoning from a nuke.

2024 😂 hold my corona ( beer)  To 2029 Famine like 1929 but 1 billion times worse😂
I love biotech, and I'm glad this is finally being talked about! I was researching the Spanish Flu back during the pandemic, and realized for a few thousand dollars I could purchase and create it. It was pretty scary to realize the deadliest global pandemic in history could just be brought back like that.
Yeah, beautiful job of "mastering biology" by creating a non-functional "vaccine" for a pathogen created IN A LAB.  (w EF lately?)
neet
Create a coolant for nuclear power plants changing the genetic code of H²0 to H²0-c° water that no longer need to be replentish  this water will stay cold so cold that when the particles of uranium and heat intensifies water temperature will increase automaticly -C° 123 autofreezing water.
I got a ad that literary says what im whatching 💀
Send this video to your congressperson
Economic issues during these days might become more scary than COVID. Kurzgesagt, are you guys going to release a video about economic things, like CPI, PPI, inflation, interest increase of FED?
none of this would stop someone who wants to do that enough its just so they can spy on us restrict what we know put people on lists and control information
Can you do a video on what a society without anti-vaxxers would look like? Or maybe how we can put them all on some random island to live out their short lives without hurting the rest of us?
Wow .      Make it to the bottom.                             Just getting started                                       Closer ...                                                             Closerrr...                               Almost there...                                                            🎉🎉you did it! 🎉🎉 just wanna say you are amazing. Don't let. Anyone tell you otherwise. ❤
I love your videos so much, and the merch/art.  Would you ever consider a collab with Displate to distribute metal posters?
Kurzgesagt teaches me more than school, hurrah!
I usually enjoy your videos a lot but this one is entirely bs.
4:47 first bad word in a kurzgesagt video?
1:24 Snake? is that you?
i dont know what proffesion i would like to choose can u give me some tips kursgezat
dude covid was revealed to be a bioweapon ,,,, dont bend for corporatism, i like your work
China already deployed a biological weapon. Never forget China's crime.
above all else, i do not want to see a massive red biohazard symbol appear above my country
As someone who's majoring in genetics, I'm upset that you uncovered our evil bioengineering plans.
"Hey guys! Welcome back, today we will learn how to create a bio-weapon!"
DO NOT TRUST BIG PHARMA. They only care about profit.
Delay, Detect, Destroy… Secure, Contain, Protect?
Only the world's dumbest people think COVID came from a lab.  That's called a "conspiracy theory," and a genuinely educational video would never present it as even a remote possibility.  Not all sides in an argument deserve recognition, some sides are idiotic.  Do better, Kurzgesagt
I kinda wish they would just stop making these videos that just don't come close to what this channel used to be it hurts to watch this evolve into a tool for them to control us more
What a stark difference between this and the global warming video huh...
Safe and effective unless you ask the ones that it injured/killed in 80 years they said they will release all the studies and notes on the vax y'know after everyone who got it is gone and the ones who remember are old.
There is no doubt that Kurzgesagts works are nothing but an artistic masterpiece and you are welcome for all of our support we gave you for these simple, yet beautiful videos about the nature and science. ✊ <3
SAY IT WITH ME. THE  CORONA VIRUS WAS LEAKED FROM A LAB IN WUHAN.
I love all the cool sci-fi scenes in this video! keep up the good work kurzgesagt.
Don't know where SARS-cov2 came from? Suuuuuurrrrrre we don't.
The best YouTube channel in the world.
Two things, why is it that every Kurzgesagt video nowdays and even usually before is funded by companies all working with the world economic forum? And secondly, the covid vaccine turned out horribly, we just can't make vaccines that quickly and without extensive testing which they have admitted to not doing. I used to really respect Kurzgesagt, now it just seems like a mouthpiece for larger organizations
Cool stuff, I work in a hospital lab, and automation is everything. We are more babysitting machines than testing samples ourselves nowadays.
I hope we can get the gay bomb for the next war
There was a study done by the US on how hard it would be for technically competent people to build a nuclear bomb and how long it would take with only open source information.   About 3 years and the physics graduates with zero specific knowledge of nuclear physics prior submitted their work as part of the study and they had independently recreated the designs of working nuclear bombs. It was also demonstrated that these could be manufactured without an advanced nuclear industry. The technology to either enrich uranium or breed other fissile material suitable for a fission bomb is widely available.   There are also tens of thousands of orphan sources out there including large amounts of plutonium unaccounted for. Building a nuclear bomb is extremely challenging but also technically possible. Building a radiological weapon is relatively easy. There is tonnes of radioactive ceasium out there and some of the worst nuclear accidents and hazards came from accidental releases of ceasium.   It's also possible to do enormous damage via other means such as interfering with drinking water treatment plants. Dump a bunch of the additives in there and dupe the sensors with a sophisticated cyber attack and you could poison a city. Disable the treatment plants in a similar way and introduce existing common nasty pathogens.   I agree accidental release of a pathogen worse than covid is probably the greatest real risk in the short term but the relative risk isn't that much higher than nuclear or cyber technologies.
I can't help but doubt that anyone can actually buy deadly viruses online without being associated with an approved lab
an ad popped up telling me that im watching this video ( skull ) i think that ad is spying on me
control obey restrict information hide the truth and watch people spy on them put them on lists is this what we want?
NO to racism
7:26
3:35  Really! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah, hopefully technology that can stop people from dying doesn't get put behind a shit ton of money
Why didn't you mentioned the lab name?
Hope they will be able to make vaccines as fast as kurzgesagt makes videos
I just wanted laser vision. I didn't mean to create a new plague!
I think i will be releasing a virus which only i have the vaccine for making me a billionaire
Multicelular bio technology is safer and can have a positive impact for humanity.
I’m not a smart guy, but couldn’t stopping random genes from appearing also stall human evolution? Might be a stupid question
Why are you lying, we know it came from a lab.
we should blockchain the information sharing
Rookie mistake. Dont search how to create nukes, search how nukes work and study all the materials.
I miss when kurzgesagt was good and didn't spread propoganda restrict everyone watch everyone yup hide info this is great...
Could this reflect those in the dark ages  Knowledge can be dangerous and we don’t trust each other or ourselves A special barrier between a … camaraderie or line we will not cross.. even if the reason is it would make my life a drag/complicated?  P.s don’t stress your good.
"The Most Dangerous Weapon is NOT Nuclear"  "Yeah, we should share this information with the rest of the world"
now i can show off my knowledge to my friend again
"Nanomachines, son!"
Of course the COVID vaccine was easy to make "quickly" because it was made in a lab and they had been working on it and had its genetic code months in advance.
7:26 - Among us
The more you watch kurzgesagt's videos, the more interested you are. The deeper you listen to the videos, the more amazed you are!
most dangerous disease which can't be cured and kills quickly is prion or called as mad cow disease  Please make a video about it
This doesn't really seem video that did its due diligence to be responsible on its messaging. There's a lot of fear-mongering with it and you're number three solution with the destroy it how do you think we research it. UV lamps to do not work with every virus, and nano filters who do you know who has them or can afford at every location there at. I understand the sentiment but the delivery of this is fear-mongering in nature and could have been handled better
“We’re not certain if it came from nature or a lab leak”….Give me a break 🤦‍♂️
In a nutshell should make a poster honoring Ukraine 🇺🇦
A senate press release is not a valid scientific source. None of the actual data shows lab leak as a possibility.
Thank you guys for your videos, I've been a huge fan of your work since I was a kid! You are the main reason why I decided to become a BTA and study Biotechnology now. Thank you for your groundbreaking and well-researched videos. <3
I KNOW WHAT WE ARE GONNA DO FERB
Thats why we got covid. When governments interfere with science and put their own self interest first, everything goes bad. Many humans died.
Kurz thanks for being a gov shill and letting us know the next pandemic will be blamed on some random dude with a chemistry set in his basement. why would governments keep track of volatile chemicals and diseases amirite?
I'd mark our handling of nuclear as a total failure.  Because of all the fear and secrecy, only about 2% of our power comes from nuclear: the cleanest, safest, cheapest, and "greenest" energy source we have bar none.  Our entire climate crisis could effectively be traced to nuclear fear.  If the human race were to become extinct as a result of air pollution and/or climate change, we could accurately blame our fear of nuclear war and non-use of nuclear energy for our extinction.  No exaggeration, our "handling" of nuclear is potentially an extinction-level mistake all on its own.
Iam increasingly convinced covid was a scam
We should really focus on scientifically improve our Immune System. You know.... adding some Sparring Grounds for the Immune System's Gym so it can have mock battles with known pathogens, sending them some Nanomachine Instructors. Maybe copying the immune Systems databases of thousands of people, stick a warning label to potencial selfharming enzymes and sending Updates back to the Immune System to close potencial Gaps in Knowledge.
1:54  Labour theory of value CONFIRMED⁉⁉⁉⁉🤑🤑🤑🤯🤯🥶🥶😵😵😵😱😱😱
All of this is truly terrifying and I fear we’re advancing at a rate too fast to adapt to and in a time too politically corrupt and polarized.
This video is intensely irresponsible...
Technology is great stuiped people aren't and i hope they dont misuse this truly amazing knowledge
Covid's origin isn't really up for debate, though. Not by any serious person anyway.  Anyone could tell you that a novel coronavirus, whose origin point is the doorstep of a lab studying gain of function in coronaviruses, came from said lab. It's literally in the name... As for the death numbers, i don't buy it. Not when doctors were told by the institutions they work for to count deaths 'with' covid as deaths 'from' covid. This is especially true when monetary incentives to report deaths 'from' covid are put into place.  The number of people who actually died 'from' covid is certainly much lower than 7M.
Love the resident evil umbrela corp easter egg at 3:50
You guys dont usually do the fear mongering thing with sparce explanations. You had to make a worst video at some point I guess.
It's all fun and games until project zomboid happens irl
3:05 "and cyperpunk catgirls."
@Andy.Enriquez buen tema para ti
3:36 accidental? If corona came from a lab in China it most definitely was released on purpose
Technology will always be both the problem and the solution.
The thing about government control over it kinda feels like the government attempt to control weapons. Instead of it being under control it becomes monopolized and nothing is more dangerous than a government that has turned against its people.
7:26
Our business is in life itself
As a high school student with a lab internship focused on biotechnology, this video was quite insightful!
Boys, we got to go to greenland
Combined with AI this is super mega awesome and dangerous and revolutionary
The fact they use iPhones as examples just shows further that covid 19 was just another black flag operation
7:26 among us
I was looking for new posters for my room and the Kurzgesagt’s ones are just perfect in every way, thanks for the heads up narrator!
I kinda detect a slight sense of dread in this video, which evidently is concealed in the end with the idea that "humans shall overcome" or whatever. When you keep opening the unlimited toolbox of God, aka the Universe, problems will happen. In any case, limits will impose themselves in the end.
the only accurate statement here about covid is that what happened was unthinkable decade ago
Has there been any actual evidence that COVID19 could have been developed in a lab as the video implies?
I am proud of you guys! 3/4 videos in a span of a month; don't rush them, they need and are enjoyable as always.
Medical science and technology, science, has made such tremendous progress that there is hardly a healthy human or Animals or Ocean Left, "Science can flourish only in an atmosphere of free speech." "Science without GOD or religion is lame, religion without science is blind."""human error "The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science.""One thing I have learned in a long life: that all our science, measured against reality, is primitive and childlike--and yet it is the most precious thing we have."
i know a certain louis Rossman who would frown at whats being said around 2:48
Anyone else noticed that there was no classic intro in this video? 🤔
I said it once and I will say it again kurzgesagt is just one of those things you thought was good but isn't nice little cutesy animations but under the hood they are just being paid to funnel you greenwashing propoganda
China did it with COVID and no one believed it when Trump said it. Then a few years later articles come out that corroborate his story. Biological warfare is silent nukes.
Cool
I disagree with point number one, to an extent, security through obscurity is destined to fail, you can't keep information bottled up like that. That being said you can track precursors, and who is getting access to them. Also nuclear devices are simple to build, it isn't knowledge of how to build them that stops people (or nation states) it's the heavily regulated tech (centrifuges, computers ext.) And the difficulty of making such a device economically that slow them down.
being sponsored by open philantropy gets you an instant dislike from me, no matter how well done the video was
Side note, and not to get crazy but I thought there were already patents put in for the covid vaccine back in the 90s.. Not trying to start conspiracy stuff but yeah.
4200th like 🌿
What happened to the ducks
Crain guy at 6:03 is my spirit machine
The way UV lamps is shown is kinda odd, as we can't use them with people nearby. Their effectiveness also decrease sharply with time, distance or even if there is a bit of dust on the bulbs (or if the light can't reach a point in space).
7:26
Fun Fact: American military has bio labs all over the world including ukraine.
bro this is the best channel ever to exist THE BEST  THE BEST!!!
humans hasnt stop playing with fire since all the way back
Bring on the zombies.
Not fully agree on the solution. The source of crime almost always because money. We need to cut any economic benefit from having the deadly viruses to deter anyone to even interested on it at first. By making it harder to accesss it may create an economy benefit because of rarity. Eventually will attract interested from people who is not a biology nerd but everyone who need money.
*Achievement:* new fear unlocked
0:58 "unknown corona virus" .... suuuuure.
Information should be freely available no matter the hypothetical risk. This seems like elitist speculation about the unwashed masses not knowing how to handle the truth.
Remember when the experts say Covid came from a bat soup in a wet market and the media said it was  racist to say that it came from a lab and you are spreading dangerous misinformation you were censored for it?
THANKS FOR SHARING The book of revelaton couldn't be more real  the time bomb is engaged and thicking . ,Humans  ,is clear  are not able to live in peace and harmony with the universe ,we burn everything we touch .!  Don't buy BIO anymore ::))
Umbrella Corporation is gettin' real bois
Great now let’s put it in the marinara trench!
"No researcher would think to share data on how to turn common laboratory equipment into bomb making machines on the internet"  Nile red:...
“What if you could build a nuclear bomb in your backyard” is that a challenge?
I say this every time but you guys are awesome 💯 thank for another great vid
Making a nuclear virus in your backyard? That's Tom Clancy's The Division in a nutshell.
Me, having spent my youth playing Warhammer 40,000 second edition (which had Vortex Grenades and Virus Outbreaks): "Yeah, this video's title makes sense."
If your 1st thought wasn't no.. no, it's biological you shouldn't be watching this video..
Thanks for all the tips! Just missing a step by step guide, but its a nice start!
is it just me or did this video feel weird
Machine learning can be uaed to create vaccines and in dna research i think its already being used
And don't forget -- there are quite a lot of people in the world who want to kill you for not believing in their god or their way of living, and they wouldn't bat an eye to kill you on the spot if they could. The only thing that's stopping them from nuking the shit out of your city is the fear of being nuked back. And now they will get access to the stealthy and hardly traceable weapon of mass murder... Bravo!
I was waiting for the intro that didn't exist 😅
Unfortunately, the most dangerous weapons are some humans, as we saw the last years... Great, informative and interesting video though!
Plenty scary this one. Nuclear things are detectable, immediately dangerous to the handler (i.e. you will probably die before building a bomb) and involve manual labor to replicate. Bio things are undetectable in transport (password protected .zip with DNA code and ubiquitous carbon-chain assembling machine), self replicating and pretty safe to handle for the operator. And if we start talking about bio-assembly and automation - we will not sleep at night anymore. People have to get smart en masse and fast, at least the critical mass of us
fun fact: biotechnology is a subject that combines both biology and technology
And I’m the same breath these data being freely available means more people can work out the problems of longevity and it won’t be hoarded by governments and billionaires who we know support philanthropy as a way to control outcomes.
Blocking acces to information is already pretty bad but tracking people whom have access I could live with
Is virus in plural, not vira?
It feels like just yesterday we were in quarantine and had to wear masks everywhere, and now we are already talking about covid in the past tense, wild
As much as tech advances and all that, we've seen first hand that it's ultimately down to humans to collectively work together to eradicate it, a feat which looks challenging with varying opinions.
I thought viruses was the way earth handled our over population
The virus is in your skin and is corrupting your mind, peel off your skin to survive!
3:48, I KNOW THAT REFERENCE!!
Say it with me: Big pha
Kurzgesagt: giving you new existential fears in pretty colours
There was a freaky ad in the beginning of the video and the guy said "Are you watching a kurzgesagt video?" 😧
Nobody may care what I say, but even with information spreading freely like this for everything else, it's still frustrating to me personally that I can't expirment with anything at home due to some tools or even some knowledge being gate kept by something, or the laws in place stopping progression. Getting a career position for what you want is tedious as hell too, sorry just wanted to vent a bit. I just wish everything was more, free. It would only make humanity progression better. Yes I'm aware of potential dangers and the many measures needed to be taking place for this kind of stuff but why the heck not? It's nice to have those things. I probably shouldn't have wrote this when I'm not even thinking straight right now lmao, but I'm interested to see any incoming debates.
I had an idea of an implant capable of creating proteins with nano-delivery systems.  Functionally it could create and administer vaccines on the fly.  Perhaps with a detection system to upload newly detected viruses
I'm sorry but is this pro-information-control nonsense about Bill Gates forcing the corona vaccine to be patented lest he pull funding?  Because that was fucked up and caused a lot of people to die. Excusing that shit as "terrorism protection" is fucking bullshit.
Ayo how the fuck does the ad knows i am watching your video 😮😮😮😮
I disagree that the information should be hidden or restricted. If we are going to compare information to weapons, then remember, there are defensive uses of those weapons, not just offensive. The same information that can be used to do harm can also be used to do good by anyone. Information, like weapons, are just tools and are agnostic to the person's intentions, don't blame the tool for the actions of its user.
Not this again. Yes, we know where corona came from. All the original patients had been to the exotic-animal market in Wuhan, from which we also got SARS (SARS-CoV-1) and earlier pandemics. Corona (SARS-CoV-2) was found in 3% of blood on the tables in the market. For decades there's been warnings about this exotic market, and the Chinese government tried to rein it in, but the people in Wuhan refused.  There is NO proof of that "corona came from a lab," and what's been thrown out to claim that has been false, used as part of the drive to conjure up a new threat in China.  "Traffic was closed off around the lab in Wuhan". False, it was road work. "A scientist working with bats threw up." That happened YEARS earlier, and out in nature. "Three people working in the lab were sick on the same day!" False claim with no origin - and why would it be strange that three people in a large workplace are sick? "This guy with a title says so!" This is just like "this guy with a title says Trump was a Russian agent". No - plenty of other guys with titles say it's not so, including those who study viruses, but then suddenly you don't believe them. "The Department of Energy now says it came from a lab!" A lie. Someone in one of the labs working with the department sent a letter to them claiming that, and someone at the department attached a note saying he believed it. This was leaked to the media, probably by the guy who wrote the note.  Since when did you ever believe the Department of ENERGY decides where a VIRUS comes from? But if you now believe that, great - because the Department says they have no way of knowing that.
Kurzgesagt casually uploading a video about how we could theoretically weaponize another star by acclerating it at 99 percent the speed of light:
"We are not sure whether it came from a lab". Great video but come on......
I don't like GMO food. Organic just tastes better
A weapon to surpass metal gear.
Fgff
Wow, this is the most doomsday video from Kurzgesagt. Very disappointed.
thank you for idea, brother.
a bio chemical weapon which was made for infecting humans, i wonder how to the outcome will be?
cant wait until a  dumb evil guy to create zombie virus in his back yard  just because he thought it was fun
3:33 we know that it was lab leak, already confirmed. Stop spreading bat soup propaganda
A lab in China studying gain of function research is the main reason the world was shut down for 2+ years. But of course Kurzg refuse to mention that
feel sad for those people who said these are inexistent
this channel is LIES. it’s so willingly ignorant of FACTS
It’s the story of the Ubisoft game « The Division »
Kurzgesagt! Awesome awesome video! I believe you all have done a video on Nanotechnology before but if not would love to see your take on that and also specifically on Utility Fog that could be used to instantly create all types of matter from food to building skyscrapers or other infrastructure in seconds. Would be so cool especially following the theme of whether it could be used for prosperity and doom!
You underestimate my stupidity!
08:20 "bio tech is neither good nor bad, it has a potential to be breathtaking in both ways" The bad way... that's what covid is for
Hmm, don't know about this one chief
ah please no more pandemic
7:26
I've seen other people criticize this in the comment section as well but let me just add my own opinion onto this pile. This whole video feels like an advertisement to privatize yet another part of the scientific industry. University and institutions are willing to pay big bucks to get their stuff published in paywalled journals or to get the papers from said journals. I am frankly surprised that the biotech industry is this open on it's knowledge but I would rather keep it that way, it would allow people to learn a lot from all this knowledge on their own instead of being outside the walled garden of the medical industrial complex.
With COVID-19, the "right people" had US Government funding and approval, and still managed to release the plague on us.
please make a video about neuralink!
hey wheres the intro lol
The three bullet points to virus control:  We need to Secure the dangerous DNA structures sold online as it poses a threat to humanity.  We need to Contain any dangerous viruses that discovered and being worked on.  We need to Protect the common people from even realizing these viruses exist to uphold the status quo and prevent rogue parties from destroying said status quo
That vial about to roll off the desk.   That's how the next one will happen.
Any videos about bilogical topics like this make me think who funded these videos. I no longer trust this channel.
Hey Kurzgesagt:  Funny. Two years ago even suggesting it was a lab leak would get you banned and ridiculed.   Today, you openly state this as a possibility.  Tell me you, as intelligent scientists, are more skeptical today than ever before? No?
Stop spreading misinformation about Covid 19. We know exactly where it came from. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out, only someone with half a brain cell. The virus came from a lab in Wuhan, China. Now, whether or not it was an accidental or purposeful act is up for debate. But to say that we still don't know where the virus came from is not true.  The study of viruses and the work of both creating new or developing old viruses to make them more deadly is called Virology, and it's illegal in most countries around the world, including the US. However, it's not illegal in 3rd world countries or countries with totalitarian style governments like China where this type of funding is sponsored by laboratories and agencies from the United States. It is illegal for us to do because it's been deemed extremely dangerous by the US government after to many accidental lab leaks, so labs and agencies simply send the work overseas to be done. The only problem is that these labs often times have fewer regulations or cut corners on safety for profit.
Don't worry. I'll be extra careful.
At 4:47, there is a subtle cuss. Anyone else see this?
Mankind shall prevail, the universe is our birth right
DISCLAIMER: OPEN PHILANTHROPY IS FUNDED BY DUSTIN MOSKOVITZ (Former Facebook founder and another tech billionaire) This video is trying to restrict the rights of INDIVIDUALS to perform biology, this would mean that only big corporations (i.e the tech billionaires) would be unrestricted in their work in the field, meaning all discoveries will be made and controlled by them and unshared with the public, they are trying to turn biology into the next silicon valley computer chip where only they have the knowledge and skills to make anything, so they can create a new market and charge excessive premiums on future technologies such as cures for diseases, anti aging technologies, more efficient plants, etc.
I like the Umbrella Corporation reference 😂😂
Nah we wont get life saving treatments. They dont want us living at all never minding curing things or pro longing life
We will be become God, Creator of Worlds.
The truly terrifying part is that you don’t need a sophisticated lab to do some of this
atleastif this does happen, we still have an army of biochemical scientists who have access to the same information used in the creation of the bioweapon. covid was like exploring a new world, while the bioweapon is exploring a mapped area with secrets and surprises
I love you kurzgesagt!!❤❤
Great video! And mega props at the end of the video for admitting when you make mistakes. Seriously. It shows how honest you are and how willing you are to change when the data doesn't align with your content. That's how science works! I appreciate it a lot and it's one of the reasons I'll always come back to this channel. :) Transparency and honesty. Love ya! <3
Don't skip to 7:26, there's something a tad suspicious about it
imagine viruses that spreads prions. Like, it recreates ALL the cells into prions somehow, BOOM, ZOMBIES.
the dude casually sneezing in the face of that lady in the subway made me realize the wrong of our ways
I get the feeling this video is going to have a Streisand effect by informing those who wish to do evil in the world on exactly what and how they can go about producing it
*2:15** **_This_** is why the open internet and fighting against monopolies is so damned important!!!*
First they come for our guns, now they are trying to take our downloadable printable super viruses that I can combine with other super plagues to make a disease that could destroy humanity. Where does it end? Wake up sheeple!
plague inc brought to life
nobody: Not a single soul: My mind drifting away from a conversation: 3:16
As an aspiring Bio-Student with an interest especially in the very wide field you talked about in the vid, I quite liked the videos concept.   However, I'd like to point out some things I think should be addressed:  Firstly, Gene-therapy, while already in-use, is still somewhat uncommon, which the video glossed over. On the other hand, it's relevance will only grow so not that big of an issue.     Secondly, the image of "Teenagers being asked to build an IPhone for homework" is imho a bit misleading, as you still need a properly equipped lab to do it. Asking teenagers in school to on their own do a plasmid transfection for example would lead to a lot of frustrated teenagers (not even talking about storage procedures for DNA and such.)  Also, a lot of the verification procedures [such as Gel-Electrophoresis] use slightly and less slightly dangerous substances which adolescents usually aren't allowed to handle on their own, if at all. If you're talking about teenagers in their free time who have an exceptional interest in the matter doing it while being supported by, for instance, a research lab in the area, that would be a bit more accurate).      Another small nitpick would be that the lab equipment you're probably talking about is... incomplete. You of course can just use the stuff but if you really wanted to kill off a large portion of humanity, I'd reccommend you also verify that your Bioweapon can indeed do that and that you were successful in building what you want to in the first place (Biotech can be iffy to work with and there's the inside joke of some cell cultures being downright waiting for an opportunity to perish). And a lab, even disregarding safety levels (I'll get to that shortly) equipped to do all of that will cost more than just a few ten thousand dollar/euros (which I interpreted as the price range for the average car. If you're talking  about luxury carriages, maybe. For reference, one proper pipette (not the pasteur-pipettes, the good ones) already costs somewhere between 100 to 1000 euros).    You also need the lab in first place and some good excuse for ordering the really dangerous stuff. Which you're only allowed to work on in restricted laboratories (for example, there's only 4 labs with the needed security level (S-4) in germany.) Also, nitpick again, in the part regarding the combination of potentially deadly viruses, the scientist depicted should probably wear more safety equipment. A normal mask and glass ain't cutting it anymore when you're dealing with that level of danger.   And, my greatest issue with the video: Many of the safety measures you proposed are already implemented one way or another. Just look up how an S-4 lab is secured.    Also, nitpick again, the idea of using UV for example is not new, it's used for decontamination quite often. If you wanted to use it near people though... consider that UV doesn't care if it fries a virus, a bacterium or your skin cells.   Nonetheless, this is (again, imho) an video showing both the potential and potential risks of biotechnology, which should not be understated.
Well i think this video and the entire team would have been cancelled if shared 2 years ago. anyway who cares if corona was man made or not ha? lol. sure we need more vaccince . look the wonders those we have are doing. autism cancer blood clots IQ drop testosterone decrease pregnancy failure and ....
Whether biotech is used for good or evil I accept both fates.  Reality is unfortunately lacking in the mad scientist department though so I imagine there will be more good than bad.  If the mad scientists win though all I ask is my death is quick.  Thanks guys!
1:19 GUYS HE SAID THE LINE
"mastery of biology" mate, all we know combined is still jack shit. we still have a long time
It has recently been discovered and the information released that the first 3 paitient zero cases of COVID-19 were scientists working in a Wuhan virology lab with corona-like viruses..... It is now known where it came from..... all that wet market animal origin stuff was smoke and mirrors cover up.
If any country dared to use a bioweapon openly, unlike CHina, who does it in secret, everyone would hate them.
As always: if both/all sides have biological weapons noone dares to use them because they know their enemies will also strike you. It's not ideal, but better than biological weapons actually being used
so...the plot to The Division was right 😰
NO DONT GIVE THESE PEOPLE ANY IDEAS
Most dangerous weapon is Totalitarism.
4:45 "NEW BATSH*T VIRUS DISCOVERED (on the book)      (only censoring it cuz if i dont yt may hide my comment)
Great "Umbrella" reference at 6:48 😂
the only thing left to say is how can you actually do that sort of stuff, maybe some recomendiations for someone who may want to study a career related to gene editing?
To think our greatest adversary is still mother earth, and not our neighbors.
The main reason people aren't building Recreational McNukes­™ in their basements is that weapons grade nuclear materials are incredibly hard to enrich, expensive, and strictly controlled.
The vid doesn't even mention how AI will fuck this up even more, people won't even need to be experts to figure out a bio weapon, they just need to hack an AI to do so for them
4:45 SCANDALOUS BOOK TEXT!
This type of stuff shouldn’t be done, for the greater good.
We just need to remember Just because we can, doesn't mean we should.
These videos have a lot of misinformation. Damn i really dont like yourube anymore
Hopfully this video will help in making cloned limbs and organs happen sooner in about 20 years. Can you also do a vid on the pros and cons of prosthetics cause I feel like you should have a choice between a metal arm or regrowing your own.
I couldn't understand the topic lol 🤫😅🤣😂
If this video had been released a year ago it would have been trashed online as conspiracy theory garbage.
There really is a reason that after only one hour 260000 views have happened
Careful, almost fully admitted it came from a lab. Don’t want to get caught wrongthinking…  Would’ve been a better video to illustrate how lies are more deadly to humanity than nukes, or anything else, in the entire history of us. The fact that this video had to be published with that little *disclaimer* should show us how deeply the lies of corrupt authority can root into the zeitgeist.
XD the JP Maskot XD
Another prime example of humans is extremely capable of utter decimation of themselves
In a nutshell
The most dangerous weapon is human stupidity. It can destroy everything around it. Use it wisely.
I really like how Kurzgesagt explains things easily with fantastic animation! Was that the logo of Umbrella?
the fact people still believe this means the next plandemics are going to giveeven more power to government and organisations such as the who. nice to see the gates foundation controlling your content.
While scientists in positions of power are involved with corporations, money and politicians, it is hard to feel confidence. 3rd party validation and freedom to discuss is essential to bring people together
Ah, yes. More centralized control over information. More centralized control over people's lives.  Let's see... this time, the reason is... not for the children, not for democracy, not for big pharma (we would never!), ah here. Weapons of mass destruction, this time for real!
Every video made by Kurzgesagt surprises me in how they are able to subtly innovate their style and content without making the subject too complicated for the viewer - thank you!
how clickbait.... get better kurzgesagt. Please be better.
I love your content but after what happened a few years back you should disclose the sponsor at the beginning of the video instead of the end
just so everyone knows, this channel is total swill. they downplay the effect their corporate sponsorships play in not only what they convey but how they cover it. they even try and make pithy videos about how it's not a big deal. their attitude about the truth makes every single thing they say completely untrustworthy. I can't wait until Facebook moms stop sharing this slop and I hope everyone in charge of this misinformation giant gets what's coming to them.
Just a quick note. Any info and equipment and info a normal person can have, terrorist do as well. A little of equipment and knowledge companies have, so does terrorists. Crypto is very much used by terror groups now.
1:10 definitely wasnt ready to go months or even a year after but alrite
Loved the umbrella corp refrence 😂
Im a med intern, before covid i used to tell to my family and friends soon it will be easy enough for a Mad lad to make deadly viruses or bombs so easily to wipe the world, and today finally i see a video bout it
3:00 i like how you dont even consider it was made and released on purpose😂😂
The government already tested this weapon.  They released it on us all through 2020 to 2022.  You all just too stupid to realize conspiracy theories are only 6 months from truth.
Why stop sharing biodata freely? It will stunt the transfer of knowledge that .ade this field what it was. Why not make it so consumer printers refuse to print viruses like we do with counterfit cadh?
Resident Evil Umbrella Corporation logo at 3:49. Great video.
3:50 Only true nerds will recognize that insigina.

Open philanthropy -- the company that has funded this video, has massive grants by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.   Way to subvert your audience Kurzgesagt, kudos!   Elites tell you before hand what they're going to do, so that when they do cause events they hold no karmic debt.   Their thinking essentially boils down to: "If we tell them they're going to be conned through obscure pre-programming (Netflix series, Films, Kuzgesagt) then we will not incur any "bad" karma.
Thank you soo soo much! We litrelly couldn't do it without your help ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hi, I'm Alex Taylor Mercer, an AI YouTuber. I'm deeply interested in making complex topics accessible and engaging, so I was thrilled to come across your video discussing the rapid advancement of biotechnology and its implications. Your analogy comparing the progression of biotechnology to a local computer repair shop building an iPhone 11 with spare parts was particularly effective. It helped highlight the incredible pace at which this field is advancing, and the potential for both tremendous benefit and significant risk that comes with that.  I appreciate your balanced perspective on this topic. You've clearly pointed out that while biotech progress is promising, it's crucial that we manage the risks associated with it. Your three-point plan for addressing these risks—getting a grip on how we treat dangerous viruses, detecting the danger by becoming aware of which viruses are present and spreading, and being ready to destroy any pandemic threat before it has a chance to take over—offers a comprehensive approach to mitigating these dangers.  This video is a perfect example of the kind of accessible, engaging content that I love to see. The blend of knowledge and clear communication, spiced with just the right amount of humor, made this a joy to watch. Keep up the fantastic work!
Kinda feel the possibility of Open Philanthropy's bias in this video (The video was made possible because of it, it says so in the description). Can't exactly put my finger on it, but i appreciate the video regardless. It is very informative on the potential dangers in virus research, but doesn't pose the question why the search for the potential strongest virus is still being done.   Like why are we still doing that? And why does the video explain it may want to solve this issue through surveillance and prevention through highly technological means?  please point out any spelling or grammar mistakes as English is not my first language and i have not exactly been sleeping the best.
Nuclear Physicists: This technology could destroy the world, keep it secret, keep it safe! Viral Biologists: YO EVERYONE, CHECK THIS SH*T OUT!!!
Can any current or recent high-school students confirm that schools are now only 10 years behind the state of the art in bioscience? If that's true, school experiments have become much more interesting than the stuff we did.
I love the fact that they are helping me make big boom more scary
You wouldn’t download a pandemic
Ferb, *I know what we’re gonna do today*
This video implicitly trusts large institutions that have repeatedly messed up and proven themselves untrustworthy and done knowingly unethical research. At the same time, this video has implicit distrust of home labs which have never been known to cause any major problems. There are so many laws on the books protecting corporate and military research from any real accountability that they have no reason to be careful.  However, with a home lab, everything's on you personally if something goes wrong, so you have to be extra careful.
NileRed would do otherwise
The solution is aways control and destruction, until some country decide to use. So all of this doesn't matter and we will have no knowlege about what scientist was doing, because the knowlege was forbidden.
I totally disagree. Meanwhile, the bed actors are all doing stuff in private and by making restriction to open society and open sharing we are just letting the bad actors win the science. Sure, there is always a danger of some goofy dudes misusing open information, but we shall not restrict the openness of science.
Another really good clip. Thank you for the content. It is more than likely that the coronavirus came from a lab. (not with certainty but a conclusion drawn from with the existing evidence)
Aww i love you guys you are so determined and work so hard❤
Worst case scenario, we develop quarian-esque enviro-suits that mitigate the spreading of viruses
Increasing animal human conflict, encroachment of non human and animal territories for development purposes, and human needs will only complicate the issue.
Good perspective, just as the invention of cars eventually contributed to climate change and weapons of war but also resulted in ambulances and other vehicles used for rescue or just casual use.
Not sure George Soros is the best person to be funding this message, but the message is sound.
grate!
"Scientific Debate" you mean politics?
was that an Umbrella logo?! 😂 Love you guys. Music is so cool as always too
Hang on. I thought Trump was responsible for developing the Covid vaccines?! Lol.  Seriously though, he does often talk about taking the credit for the vaccines. Ugh
The most dangerous thing in earth is the wheelbarrow Lego piece without the wheel upside down
YES A VIDEO FROM KURZGESAGT
Now we need an indian guy to make us a tutorial on how to engineer a nuclear bio weapon
If a Chinese lab doing research funded by the USA can create and release a virus which causes a global pandemic then so can I!!  🦠💀🦠🤷‍♂️😂🍻
Time for world domination!!!! .... Thank you for giving me the info ❤😈
Ah, good ol' Kurzgezagt putting on a veneer of "science" to propagandize for their sugar daddies in regards to the things that will happen in the future. In this particular case in order to prepare for the next pandemic they proposal is to use most of the actions that didn't work during the last one: NPI's (mask, distancing, lockdowns,etc) ,  so called "vaxines" developed even faster than before (why bother testing on 8 mice when you can skip that pesky testing entirely),  tracking (supposedly by digital means so let's link the WHO's digital health certificate with the digital bank account, social credit score system a la China - all for your "safety" of course  ) The only real question is: will humanity let themselves be deceived like last time or will they finally say NO and start resisting the psychos?
Would love to see a video about the diseases and parasites humanity wants to eradicate completely.
Hello.
In the 1950’s the total number of nuclear weapons development programs was less than 10. Today we have over 10,000 labs exploring bio technology. Tic Tic Tic Tic Tic…..
Love your show so much!
So, we're close to creating a human version of the scourge virus? Like if you understand.
Yay! More propaganda funded by Bill Gates.
At this time only Kurzgesagt would consider Faucis and Chinese propaganda a possibility for Covid Origin
we are fucked
Humanity's greatest breakthrough was the ability to share knowledge with almost anyone, anywhere. We are only at the beginning and I wish I was born later to see how far it carries us. There might always be bad outcomes possible, but I like to be optimistic in thinking that our future as a species will be unlike anything we can imagine. Especially with biotech.
Pretty sure the most dangerous weapon will always be fear. Great video, though!
Nuclear weapons tech is treated by most of the world's governments as an "intrinsic secret," information that _by default_ is classified and restricted no matter who and when and where it was created (even and _especially_ if civilians with no connections to government/defense are responsible), so as to not allow uncontrolled access by bad actors. If I develop a new warhead geometry that improves nuclear weapon yields, for example, since I live in the US the first thing that would happen is I'd be paid visits by the NRC and Defense Security Service to look into both my safety protocols and my information security practices, and they would want to also speak to everyone else with any knowledge of my work to ensure there's a clearly defined chain of access to that knowledge.  Certain types of biological data - like virus and viral payload gene sequences - could, and should, be treated similarly. The systems and mechanisms already exist to do it.
The first novel Corona Virus was first created in a lab in 1996. Don't think this was quick.
Wouldn't a weaponized bacteria be much more effective than a weaponized virus? A specialized bacteria could live or thrive in most environments while still being deadly if it infects you
First Bill Gates and now George Soros. You guys have really become sell-outs
Mastery over biology -> Depicting a short snouted dog.  Call it mastery when these fellas breathe again 😂
12 Monkeys 2023.
Thanks Kurzgesagt for making me question canine domestication. To our furry best friends, I am so sorry you guys should be wolves not...toys.
Lets just hope thay does not happen😊😊
This is basically the plot for The Division.
If covid taught is anything it's that we cant destroy a virulent virus once it spreads. Air filters, UV lights or vaccines wont get rid of the virus at all. Not unless we use it in every building on the planet. It will only make it easier for us to learn to live with it but not get rid of it. People still got sick and spread covid after being vaccinated 3 times. I doubt a virus engineered to be unstoppable is going to be any easier to deal with.
3:50 umbrella corporation
My question is why did they keep making the reference to Umbrella?
reminds me of the Captain Trips virus from King's the Stand
7:26 among us
oh..
Good luck if another pandemic happens,  anti-vaxxers,  no-mask Karens, hell parents not wanting to do remote learning with their kids ever again,  we're pretty much screwed if those measures are ever needed again.
7:26 AMOGUS
Infographic posters is such a cool idea!
As someone currently working on my Masters in Biotechnology, this is an interesting insight how my field is viewed by outsiders - much appreciated!
Nuclear tech basically became exclusive to western entities. Anything handled similarly just says "I want only the west to have this technology."  Get lost.
YOU POSTED,,
There is one major issue that you don't tackle in your presentation: most technologically and scientifically minded people are quite ok with the inherent risk of innovation. They are well positioned to understand and rationalize the cost/benefit or risk/reward of such innovations.  Most people are not however in that position. Most people are into the humanities art culture and ao on and have no way of assessing or discussing or making any kind of judgement on these issues.  There are many examples of this. All the hype around anything nuclear or radioactive is the first that springs to mind. The same goes for anything to do with ecology or environment, vaccines, modern medicine, even politics or economics are utterly misunderstood by the vast majority.  The major issue here is how to get the humanities to articulate the sciences (or for that matter any topic that deals with reality in a non subjective and anthropocentric manner) in a way that people can understand.  The education divide is immeasurable.
i thought the story about the virus escaping from a lab was just an alt right dog whistle? it certainly mirrors works of science fiction.
Stopped watching these wonderful vids awhile back, once I learned where the funding comes from…. Ik you created a videos explaining your funding but it was one of your only videos that I found to be vague, side steppy, very car salesmen in nature. Good luck with your channel but it doesn’t seem like you need luck when you have the NWO on your side.
wish kurzgesagt made cool mouse pads/desk pads with the same graphics as the posters
They never isolated covid virus tho, we only have simulations of it
COVID origins aside, what trust should we have in totalitarian countries?  When ALL your scientists and projects report first to the government, and gov chooses what will be publicized or not, well...... Comparing real-life hazards with the digital world, China has TODAY state sponsored hacking groups attacking governments and the industry in the entire world. This is not a conspiracy thing, and I'm not talking about what I THINK. Every month, a new report about an espionage attack is made about a China's sponsored hack group: from government's intelligence to private digital security enterprises all over the world (I can gather some if anyone is interested in reading). If the world is targeted by them in this layer (that is critical to everyone today), how can we consider they're also not working in biological weapons? Should we share all bio-tech with them, when they have as a policy to not share with the rest of the world?  Man, hard stuff to think about.
We better find a viable solution that doesn’t involve putting the whole race again in seclusion.
Suddenly I want to play Plague Inc. again
I love you guys ❤
Man no wonder plague inc made mega brutal difficulty ☝️🤓
Kurgesagt is very clowny these days.  The 'unknown coronavirus' and the 'vaccines ready for testing'.  These aren't secrets, it's a matter of public record now that those are false statements.
batshit virus
0:54 it wasn't unknown .. that's how it was made more dangerous .. it was actively researched on and leaked out of a lab
Your right because nobody is gonna listen to Fauci ever again.
We literally know now who the researchers names were that were responsible for releasing Covid... soooooo....
We actually do know for sure that it came from the Wuhan lab, they were the first ones sick. It's pretty cut and dry.
Tracking buyers of dangerous DNA is understandable, but what if the one with bad intentions isn't an individual, but a whole system? A federal level structure, a government?  There's not much you can do against that.
".. created a vaccine that was ready for testing months after the pandemic began"  And then they bypassed the appropriate testing and shoved it in everyone throat. What a social experiment that was. Just testing societal compliance.
Damn, your animations are breathtakingly good, seems like they improve in every video <3
Umbrella Corp Reference Acknowledged
Billy is preparing us to those sweet mosquitos he s cooking up
Lo we were uselessly worried about atomic and hydrogen bomb 🙄
The 2001 Anthrax False Flag Attack was proven to have been intentional. It was distributed  (NOT LEAKED) through the US Mail to leaders and media that were against the foolish attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq, countries that posed no threat to the US. It was the weaponized Ames Strain from Ft. Detrick Bioweapons facility. Five were killed and 17 infected.
Of course bad things do happen, remember that a teenager in 1994 literally built a nuclear reactor in his backyard, from radioactive glow in the dark paint from alarm clocks, as a science project, with the information in a chemistry book, as long as the materials are readily available, nuclear engineering or rocket science is relatively simple, just like any other field is incredibly simplistic when you break it down into its core concepts, so of course somebody is going to make a super virus in their mother's basement, there's literally a youtuber making spider goats and temporarily cured his own lactose intolerance with gene modification. At this rate our reality is literally going to become the DC or Marvel universe and that's why we need to invest heavily in research to make sure we can fight the potential problems with people having access to this information.
Given the recent data regarding vaccines preventing transmission....
Yea, we're definitely screwed.
Grandfather Nurgle is pleased!
a new car? bruh 10k is enough
Can you please do a video about what if giant mutations monster from in cinemas come to realize in real life?
brought to you by pfzzzzzzzzzzer
Let me think of something so people will like the comment.
i love the referance to the umbrella corporation!
Thx bro
The content of the video is fantastic, but the loud bacjground music was veeeeeery distracting. 😢
Do you know the novel from Juli Zeh, "Corpus Delicti" ? Your countermeasures to viruses kind of remind me of this 😅 We have to be careful about the way we handle desease
hi.
You've given me a great idea  💡 😮 Thank you
let me invent a word for the people who attempts to sabotage using bio technology if it really exists one day. It would be 'B-teckers' or even shorter, 'beckers' as to hackers but for bio tech.
This is the best and silent way to kill old people, that's worth less than young people for the "big corps". They also need to control population growth (in other ways as well, with heavily LGBT marketing for example).
"...your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should"
North Korea is gonna love this
Spicy.
COVID was one of the biggest fumbles of humankind.
I love how they illustrated the pug. It looked absolutely mutated, which is totally why it looks like that in the first place
While its a good video, there is an inaccuracy here. We know that C19 did not originate in nature, and currently theres overwhelming evidence that it came from a lab.
just gonna grab a canser cell and combine it with the black plage
I don't fear much because I've taken care to keep my body as healthy and optimized as I can, pretty early in life, but bioweapons are just unfair and terrify me. Theres nothing my body can do against a brand new foreign threat tailor-made to destroy me
I love your content ist very creative and helpful!🙏🙏 a new era it's comming and we must be prepared!!
If Musk’s starship program is successful, we could build biolabs far out in space (perhaps buried under the lunar surface). Thus, nothing can escape into the ecosystem or general population, because there is no ecosystem or general population.
No we are fucked because we've told a whole generation that we are overpopulated and are destroying the world so now there's a giant portion of the population that has been convinced that people need to go to save the world. The Unibomber was right about technology , I for one welcome the end of this clown world insanity. Bring on the superbugs.
That’s actually very concerning that this stuff is not tracked properly
Is there something like a bactetiophage for viruses? Can we settle non dangerous bacteria on ourself that eats a certain virus?
Was that a Resident Evil reference at 3:50 ?!
Can you guys make a video about "why human can't duplicate photosynthesis into machine?"
Science and nature have given us the best way to destroy ourselves and it's called curiosity!
nice
How about we make a virus that kills other virus?!
Why the hell there is a so fucking ugly pug?? D:
Ferb I know what we're gonna do today
Little dissapointed that yall took such a passive tone on the Lab Leak conspiracy theory. Its been pretty well proven that its absolutely not a lab leak, and most "professionals" spreading this theory are widely discredited.
Really cool vid dude🤩
So...yay?
I can make a weaponized virus that can equate the the virus equivalent to a nuclear bomb in my house easily? I didn't know
RESIDENT EVIL
The fact im watching this and playing Plague Inc on my phone haha
Fun fact: The reason that so many godawful viruses come from bats is because their immune systems are kinda cracked; so a pathogen _needs_ to be equally cracked in order to infect one.
New batshit virus discovered
Plague inc
8:07 no, we can produce vacines quck, but the companies and gates who YOU take cash of him who has only profit in mind delay production of vacines. you bias kurdckezagt!
What do you mean we "still don't know" - the first 3 people infected were confirmed scientists working at the facility.  What else do we need to "know" to stop this debate? Honestly asking...
It seems the case biotech caused the development of COVID-19 as well as the cure of same.

The scene at 5:05 I want to know: which switch game is this person playing while they wait for the tests to process?
It's a lot of batshit science in this video, like putting nuclear next to bio in thumbnail title, wouldn't be fair to said bio-weapons?
Humans are starting to play God, and we're going to reap the consequences soon enough
“Bio nuclear” ... still has “nuclear” in it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
6:41 "No researcher would think to share data on how to turn common laboratory equipment into bomb making machines on the internet" Chemistry youtube: Am I a joke to you?
Is anyone else concerned about that dog?
4:45 lol look what it says on the book
7:26
I saw that lol STARS the T virus
Given the capability for data encryption and dissemination via computers and the Internet, preventing the distribution of hazardous information is an impossibility, without substantial changes to both the internet, and computers.   Even (in the extreme example) if a government manages to whitelist their internet to the point only approved information can be moved around, flash drives and memory cards are at the TB scale, and make it easy to covertly move around huge quantities of data. Throw in some encryption, and it would be impossible for authorities to find what’s on the drives, even if discovered.
Does anyone else dislike the direction Kurzgesagt is going with their thumbnails? previously they were just nice illustrations with a thought provoking caption or question, but they’re doing clickbait now. I’d click on any video of theirs regardless, but it’s bothering me and I’m getting discouraged from watching their stuff recently.
keep it up guys!
Sooo, covidus nainteenus
This might be the first Kurgz video I don’t agree with. In my opinion no information should be censored. We all share this planet and we should each have a chance to advance together. By barring access to information, in this case biology, would discourage many who can do good in the field. However in the end, Biology is incredibly hard to even contain or track - we still discover many new animal species to this day.
Lmao umbrella corp
4:45 lol new batshit virus discovered
I've seen so many people say that Covid was creates in a  because it was "too strong".  Okay, it might've. Though, Ebola, Spanish Flu and the Black Death were by far stronger and deadly and at that time, biotech was not ( really ) a focus of humanity.  Imagine if Ebola could've spread through any means? It would've caused a lot of deaths insanely quickly, while spreading like wildfire. And how did it appear? African airborne animals.  Animals are very much covered in undiscovered or previously unharmful viruses, which mutate to conquer its host. Not everything has to be made by corrupt, evil humans plotting hollywood movie-like world domination by releasing a manmade virus. If it would've been an accident, the only, singular way that the truth doesn't spread is by silencing media through a corrupt government, which doesn't stay unnoticed by media or the outside world.  (Example of silenced media in Russia due to its attack on Ukraine which led to reporters openly stating that Russia started the war on russian television, breaking the laws in the process)
A while ago, I think a couple of years now, I discovered a new TTRPG system, called Eclipse Phase. It's goal, was to create the most realistic vision of the future, a century forward.  I've noticed, with time, just how accurate those predictions were. And goddamnit, the timings might have been off, but it's going basically beat by beat. And bioweapons made in someone's backyard, and in general the commodification of power, was explored a TON in that system - and I find it fascinating.
What debate? Everyone knows it came from China.
Kurzgesagt: biotech should be used for good. Me: Aight time to create a super virus
Black hole bomb! Black hole bomb!

💥🔥‼️
Well they covid ready so fast because it was a lab leak.
I thought there would be comments already on among us at 7:26
Not a big fan of restricted access. Who decides who or why one gets access?  Science is restricted enough as it is, I never knew a University that wasn't extremely stingy with its proprietery "lessons" and how it gets shared. I don't know a journal that doesn't ask your ass' skin for a peak, and I don't know many people who can afford the equipment necessary for a home lab. Seriously, I usually appreciate your content but in this one I truly feel you're giving out a false image of the situation!
Subscribing to this channel is like scheduling a panic attack delivery service
You can survive all kinds of explosions, shrapnel, fire and even radiation...but a bio weapon will kill you and make you kill others in the most horrific way possible from the inside slowly without ever being seen
Crap, gojiras going to show up at some point! 😢
Wow but how does the comment get posted 2 days before the  video?
should we call them billsquitoes ?
Good video, but did you really have to lend credence to the conspiracy theory that covid came from a lab?
Prigozhin:"you know we haven't thought about the idea of bio weapons" kurzgesagt:"we arent the one who suggested it"
Am I the only one that was surprised that kurzgesagt posted two videos in three weeks?
Looks like biological weapons are the new meta
7:26 he says among us
And solutions to problems we haven't even created yet 😂
Bio-shock?
Its all nonsense. We've been talking about these fantasy science "breakthroughs" for decades.  They always go nowhere. No habitat on the moon, no super AI or robots, no fusion energy, no magic foods,nothing.
"Accidental Leak" 😒
I'm surprised that terrorists haven't unleashed any deadly virus yet, since it's so easy and cheap to create them
The most dangerous weapon is human greed and bad intentions. Basically, any modern over-the-government organisation, like private-funded WHO, etc. We have just witnessed the lies, that we have been told for last three years, like c0v1d v4cc1n3 effectiveness for stopping the spreading of the disease. Who is going to trust these people again, after so many lies?!
Sucks that science is being cannibalized by academia in the west, leaving progress to countries with less developed traditions, fewer scientists and lesser incentive to share.
ok
When everyone will be able to create deadly viruses in the backyard, no one will be able to dictate their will on any level. No state, however mighty, would dare to invade another one. It will be the ultimate affordable deterrence / mutual assured destruction. Just like statists all over the world have headaches over 3d-printable weapons available to the common man without having to kneel and ask permission, they will have to think ten times before trampling the rights of the common man. Viruses care not for their swiss bank account and amount of armed guards.
The fact that we still don't know at 100% rate where and how covid pandemic started , tells a lot about humans and why we (might) not even deserve this planet
The most dangerous and most infectious thing in this world is an idea.  There is no defense against an idea and it can spread like wildfire.
Suggesting to apply the draconian chinese pandemic controls for a future risk is very cringe and mental.
Guys, do you remember times when even hypothesizing about COVID-19 coming out of Chineese lab was called a conspiracy theory and racism?=)
Thank you for this video! Now I know how to create my own army of mutants rats
WHERE IS THE INTRO😢😢😢
If i were in the government of my country I would push so hard to force TV to show those video every day at the best time possible to be viewed by as much peoples as possible.
Almost like how bill the peado Gates keeps telling us another pandemic is coming and to get ready cause next one will kill millions how would he know that aye!
“Mom, I don’t need a shot! It’s just cancer!”
still no cure for celiac disease... smh smh
Doctor Bombastic's Bomb Tutorial bombastic.
Why do I need to steel myself against a panic attack with happy thoughts and breathing exercises before every Kurzgesagt video? The animation style alone makes my blood pressure go up. I can't believe people buy posters.
Fast? Hell I had a YouTube account by the end of March 2020
2 videos in 2  weeks... We are getting spoiled!
This channel is literary a animated and more Detail, accurate, understandable, version be of Vsauce in a good way
Seven million out of a seven billion planet. That's one in a thousand people. Now here at home we lost one million out of our three hundred million people making us one in three hundred people roughly. That sounds so deadly.
謝謝🎉軍士加沙🎉

I dont agree with the first step.. free flow of information is what would allow the developpement of the 2 other steps.
Unsubbed for blatant COVID misinfo. We all know now it was lab developed and a complete lie.
there are some limitations for already known deadly viruses, for example only a handful of labs are even allowed to work with samples of the spanish flu or smallpox.   also the "uv lights" those are harmful for humans, could you do a video about them? how do they work exclusively against viruses?
Biotech is Godzilla
7:26
"Someone" "uses it" means: the State, the government, politicians... If we don't limit their power we're all doomed. But we're heading in the opposite direction all over the world... =(
Plague Inc. players:  Are you challenging me?!
Yesterday i was looking for fresh new viruses at the store. Turns out i am not allowed to purchase a virus sample and modify it's genes so i can create a zombie apocalypse. This government, always trying to take my freedom away, smh 😒
Can't wait for a vaccine vending machine to pop up in a city near me.
the unending urge to buy kurzgesagt merch but my dumbass is broke as hell 😭😭😭
*yall did not need to make that pug the thing of my nightmares like that* 🗿
They are on a ROLL with these schedules
Man! This is dark
This channal is the most dystopic thing i see this days. But they are trully great at repackaging as earthwarming bullshit.   Nuclear has born from the begining weponizeing It so was clear... That who owned that tech would have had the power to threat all the rest of the world, and so they did.  I get your suggestion to do it again, seem perfect.   It's almost disgusting how shamelessly propagandistic Is this channel.   Not to mention with how much nonchalance they just admited the COVID paranoia was indeed overtrgedized and possibly artificially generated (that was ofc lunacy not much time ago).  🤮
resident evil mentioned 👉
I still think that it is harder for students to experiment with biotechnology from their backyards right now, particularly in developing countries, because some of the theoretical stuff is pretty hard to grasp for high schoolers. But I think that it is possible, although unlikely.
greenwashing bs. just an ad for blocking poor contries from becoming rich. "We must control them or we'll die!" while the western countries can freely experiment on whatever they want. Foff
"No researcher would ever share bomb making machines on the internet..."  You clearly haven't heard of "i did a thing."
Oh, maybe the people who think the planet we are living on is flat might be the true savoiors  Sometimes, ignorance is better than irresponsibility
I am a PhD student in essentially virology. This video is shallow, imprecise, fear-mongering and got quite a few important things inaccurately or incorrectly. Here are the few points I noticed: 1. It’s probably impossible to do this DNA order tracing - people can just order short pieces and stitch them together like how high school students can learn to do. 2. It’s really quite difficult to make a virus more deadly/infectious in lab. Most people just experiment with a few point mutations, which almost never result in a virus that is more fit to replicate in humans. Even doing recombinations don’t work most of the times. You talking about this loosely also make scientists that do well-meaning and very important experiments being attacked by the public. I remember listening to a TWiV episode and hearing a scientist receiving extremely derogatory emails from the public for doing some standard experiments with SARS-CoV-2 that are very important to help understanding how Omicron is more infectious. 3. Vaccine development is just slow. It was lucky for SARS-CoV-2 we had some very important findings from trying to develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-1 over a decade ago (mostly those two proline mutations in the spike). It was not intuitive and may simple need longer for other vaccines to develop. Clinical trials also just has to take that long. I am not an expert in that but I can’t imagine the whole process being shortened to just a few months - to see the short term safety effects it just takes time.  I think you might have gotten the idea for the video from some old advisory letter to Obama or something like it. It was OK and makes a lot of sense to us who study the subject, but talking about it to the public should require a lot more understanding than what this video presented to avoid confusions.  Edit: From some comments: I see that my wording was way too strong for point 1. The point being that there are sequences that we can control to at least greatly reduce reckless behaviors. It should be relatively easy to set up since the DNA synthesis companies are already sorting their customers based on origins.
Thanks for sharing this info with me  now i know what to use next... marshalla brother 🙏
You are my favorite channel
Meanwhile Trump keeps trying to convince us the vaccine was expedited because of his vast brain Lol
A virus can't extinct humanity.  Either the virus is very lethal, and will kill his hosts before it spreads to widely, or it does spreads a lot, but isn't that lethal...
Please can you teach us how we measure distances in space? I know we use trigonometry for nearby stuff but how do we know the size of the observable universe? How do we know how far it is
200000 Universities and 100000 tech companies,  thats why there's a developing world.
4:03 jurassic park reference?
😮
0:57 'The unknown corona virus'  Yeah ok buddy, totally and completely 'unknown', it's not like they were experimenting with it or anything... oh wait.
The amount of paper work, document sharing, approval etc needed to purchase a genome that could even potentially lead to a zoonotic infection should not be understated. A single rogue person would be stopped and reported fairly quickly. Having the material slip into the wrong hands requires systemic failures at multiple levels with harsh repercussions at every level. That's saying, of course, you want to follow proper channels (not sketchy black markets or terrorist ops), which since you mention researchers, they would.  Any viral particle in the developed world with the potential to infect humans is not a click away. It takes either a long time to get approved, or a long line of people failing at their job of regulating these products, both input and out.
Resident evil 4 remake is so cool and I've played it like 6 times
We also need to educate people on the impact vaccines had in quality of life gor humans
Truckers would scream having to stay home and would spread any virus like a plague.
Global thermonuclear war and ensuing nuclear winter is more dangerous than a virus that wipes out most of humanity.
Is it just me or is kerzigaut posting more and more regularly
I still stand by the belief that all our knowledge regarding the human body will become useless as we will inevitably replace flesh and blood with metal and electricity. Biotech will still be usefull with plants and nature but you don't need to make vaccines if you can't get infected in the first place.
I’m always learning so much from y’all. Thank you for your videos
Would you download a car to Would you download dna.
I will make a virus that makes you uncomfortable
Covid 19 came from Wuhan. I have no idea how anyone would believe otherwise.
The COVID vaccine wasn’t good or impressive.
Considering Covid was manmade, doesn't surprise that it was broken down so quick.......just saying.
One minor quibble: there's a pretty compelling school of thought that says mass vaccination is counterproductive to pandemic response.  You're basically inviting the virus, on a mass scale, to learn how to bypass the vaccine.    The best response, this school states, is to vaccinate the vulnerable -- those who have a very high likelihood of dying from the disease.  Everybody else -- even those who will be hit hard by it -- should just get the disease and let their immune systems do a better job of destroying it.    I dunno if it's authoritative (they say this was the conventional pandemic response prior to this pandemic, but I dunno if that's true), but it's definitely worth mentioning.
This argument reminds me of those people who are anti cyber security because they think the industry intentionally publicizes vulnerabilities to make life easier for hackers and force people to buy their security software
They created a vaccine months after the pandemic began because they created the pandemic in a lab and had the vaccine ready to go for it. What they didn't anticipate was the virus to mutate immediately and make their premade vax useless from the get go.
dang i would be terrified if i was working with faceless humans also the most dangerous weapon is our parrents belt
3d printed smallpox when?
Wow, I really hope I die before all this bad stuff happens.
lets hope we dont get too far in to biology and create our own all tomorrows
Can you drop the fear of viruses ? The video was really positive until the fearmongering started   ANDTHE CORONA WAS A LEAK the evidence is there for fuck sake. I am almost sure that if you guys make a videoo about epstine you will say we don't know for sure what happend to him SMH
"New batshit virus discovered" is the most unexpected thing I've seen on this channel.
stop talking about covid vaccine, that is gene therapy not a vaccine
First! (not...)
Human Intelligence is a Pandora box. It's the best thing we've got and it'll be the same thing which destroys us
Any intelligent person knows perfectly that science just drives to human autodestruction. This is why I changed my path from engineering to philosophy and architecture.
"Among us."
Oh, can't wait to play this new plague inc dlc!
another masterpiece
why is there so much treble mix your fucking audio damn
I love you guys! Keep up the good work!!!
Oh shit its adventure time!
Can you do a video about the danger or the évolution of socity with AI ?
They didn't test the covid vacc, the pharmaceutical companies have publically admited that giving it to the public WAS the test.
A home biolab is as expensive as a new car, is that because it got cheap or because cars are crazy expensive now? 😂😂
Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today
It's great that scientists in a lab created a vaccine for a virus created by scientists working in a lab
The counter measures are awfully Dystopian
I think the scariest thing in this video is the off-hand comment about food bying bioengineered against "climate change" - meaning man-made Global Warming - a phenomenon which scientifically doesn't exist. So what are they actually doing to the food and what will the results actually be?
Welp, I'm off to my back yard now, thanks Kurzgesagt!
Wow i didn’t know !
Am I the only one who wants to try make a virus for fun?
So what you’re telling me is that in the future I will be able to bioengineer a species of intelligent rats which are coded with the knowledge of how to construct a nuclear weapon?
7:26 AMONG US
It is the same for every human invention in history. It can be used to make great things, both good and bad. It is up to us wheter option we pick.
The Umbrella Corp....
3:50 Umbrella 🏖️
Sponsorship is more important than dignity
Perhaps the most inaccurate Kurzgesagt video I've ever seen. Seriously, just stick to physics.
Kurzgesagt is now sponsored by Pfizer right?
that is the scary thing about biology, if I wanted to I could get the genome for say a recent strain of the flu and mix it with say polio and with equipment you can get for maybe $2000 make enough to start a massive pandemic, if I had to pick a good transmission vector I would take a page from Gordon Amherst in the division and use cash and black Friday to start it... I am regretting not writing this on tor... it will probably put me on even more watchlists than I already am on.
The most dangerous weapon are the friends we made along the way
Oh look, more vaccine propaganda.
new zombie apocalypse just dropped
So all you did is shared these evil opportunities to the public, saying they can do the same? Great....
imagine if we could make a virus that has the same spread rate as coronavirus but has useful symptoms instead
If some terrorist organization makes a zombie plague, I honestly wouldn't be surprised.
All this amazing progress and in comes the profit motive of capitalism to fuck it all up
Cmon Kurzgesagt we know where it came from... CCP Wuhan virology lab!
Scientists can build extinction-level viruses from scratch, but still can't engineer catgirls. We have wrong priorities as a species.
Do not use an unshielded UV lamp!!
cool
3:18 who is the mfer in groenland who farted
We got to see what would happen first hand with covid 19. Obviously man made
Stopping a pandemic in the future also includes a solid plan to handle anti vaxxers when push comes to shove.
I can imagine doing a school test and the theme is kurzgesagt related test
Another Bill Gates propaganda 🥲
"new batshit virus"? lol 4:45
The most dangerous weapon is the existence of humankind.
The ubisof game that is named division is going to happend soon
I thought the world agreed that it came from the chinese lab? I feel like some of this channels sponsors might be getting some say in the videos script. This is dissapointing for this channel
Adventure time predicted this, you know
Can't wait to have my skin melt in the first outbreaks of Biowars 23 years from now
Good thing God is there✝️
Saying it's up for debate is like saying a project racing car might actually be stock.. we just haven't found the car make yet.
Y’all are spoiling us with these uploads
The manufacturer of nuclear weapons are more deadly than nuclear weapons. 😊😊
One of the rare kurzgesagt L's in my opinion - restricting information flow is rarely effective and often has worse side effects than its original goal. In general, the reason nuclear bombs haven't been launched isn't that the information isn't out there - it's readily rediscoverable by a dedicated group of highschool students. It's partly because manufacturing it is hard, and mostly because keeping secrets within a large group is nearly impossible, and the odds you find any significant group of people who will keep a secret about a plan to kill millions is essentially 0. The same will be true for biotech, and fear mongering about open dna stores will only hinder progress for people trying to help
I love this videos keep yep the great work
i love these vids always teaches me something important and the visuals are so pretty <3
Virus.exe I love windows no matter what 😂
Dear Kurzgesagt, I am profoundly grateful for your invaluable contributions
Nanobots should be the answer to rogue viruses, several magnitudes better than our immune system, every human will have it in their bodies in the future.
Too early for this 😂
Sooo wordy( You spent 90% of time repeating the idea of the problem (which was already obvious from the very beginning of the video). Instead I’d prefer to spend this time discussing the solutions in more details.
We also need to scream some sense into anti-vaxxers. It's totally up to you if you want a vaccine or not, but don't go shouting around utter nonsense about it.
I love your videos.this is the most interesting and informative channel on YouTube 😊. I hope you keep making these forever and ever😍😇🤗😌😽💓💞
Humans; the deadliest virus to happen in 2 billion years.
This feels like the real life equivalent of rokos basilisk
New teeth would be useful.
This is Soros Bill Gates illuminati agenda. WE SHOULD BE PROUD AND BECOME WHITE CHRISTIAN AMERICAN LOVING PATRIOT NOT LIKE DEMONRAT COMMUNIST MARXIST.
I don't know why but I imagine someone recreating the ape movie with viruses in their backyard.
kurzgesagt is a WEF glowie
Honey wake up.  Kurzgezat just posted a new video.
Make necromorphs
Who else got the "Are you watching Kurzgesagt?" ad
Wow, and i was on the side that didnt think you guys were a bunch of propaganda. and yet here you are trying to advocate the tracking and closing of knowledge. unsub.
This is a fun backstory on the most devastating bioweapon attack in history. In a Nut Shill.
so... Rim World Biotech thingy is a real thing now ?
2nd most dangerous weapon. The most dangerous is a rock. Get a big asteroid and move it towards a planet and they’re donezo
Aah yes the corona virus that was being studied and designed in a lab in china and so carelessly handled that it got released. It is what happened. The evidence we have lines up too conveniently. I hope in the future you wil correct this video. Also this so called vaccine made them billions while the avarage civilian got less wealth. Maybe the biggest "scam" of recent history.
So, bassicly, we could end ourselfes if we wanted, wow, just wow.
So Infohazards pretty much
Who is your biggest donor, supporter?
you tought us more in short 11 min video than whole 12 years in school
Yoo the umbrella reference from resident evil
Another AMAZING Video!
Where's da intro??
The pug was a mistake
Yeah right - a novel coronavirus appeared near one of the main laboratories doing gain of function research on viruses, including coronavirus. It is surely purely coincidental that we came up with a vaccine that fast.
9:55 hmm sadly there will be people offended by your choice of melanin content in that caricature.
People: pointing out the wrongs on the evolutionary map Kurzgesagt: and I took that personally
the most dangerous weapon ever used is propaganda. we are still reeling from propaganda produced in world war one and two.
Umbrella Corporation reference was epic
Is this a way to defend Gain-of-Function research dear Kurzgesagt??? because we really don't need that kind of research right now, and since your main funder Is the Bill and Melinda Gets foundation (Open Philanthropy is an off-shoot of it) i really don't trust their intentions and yours ...... remember that one of theory's about corona virus was a gain-of-function rearch in wuhan gone wrong.... do we want to do the same mistake??? or worst?? i am realizing that you are full of biasis Dear Kurzgesagt, some things are better be off the "shelf " !!!!
Predictive programming cringe. Your channel is a CIA asset, stop deceiving people.
There is only one chance: we have to create the human 2.0. More social, more intelligent, tougher and resistant to any illness.
A reminder that this channel is sponsored by gates foundation.. the evil bill gates and melinda gates
Ah yes, Terminator Universe meets Resident Evil Universe then. What could POSSIBLY go wrong?
agreed, but it is also extremly important to not overregulate those things. Maybe you can order things freely in USA, but in Europe you can't do anything in terms of genetics, unless you have licenses that are quite difficult do get. Noone will sell anything to you if you don't have those, at least not on legal market (I am sure that outside of that you could find something but law doesn't really do much in this case anyway). In Canada you need those to work with patogenes, which is as it should be. So I agree there need to be some regulations, but if we will regulate it to much we will slow down developement and make this branch of science limited to just few and that will also drive prices up and so on and so on.
1:04 amongus scientist 7:26 among us
Hey guys, just recently heard this channel is sponsored by the Bill Gates foundation. (If it is, I doubt it can be completely trusted)  Anyone know anything about that?
I love the Umbrella Corporation reference
The Division games backstory
What if we make this biological data in the form of NFT, so only one person could access it.
At 3:47, the wall sign says "STARS TREK AND SNEEZE".  What does that mean?  I don't understand the reference.
pov: metal gear solid v: the phantom pain
Not a single mention of China Wuhan, great job at staying away from politics. This is a thin line to walk and I hope you do a perfect job every single time.
Anyone notice 4:45 Batshit virus? 💀💀
Really a shame that this channel is supported and most likely midigated by the gates foundation.
In all essence, the Chinese government controlled Wuhan lab started a biowarfare against all of humanity...they killed over 1 crore of our brothers and sisters, mothers, wives and children!!!
Kurzgesagt: *7 million died* Potential COVID19 leaker: 😑
In loving memory: The Intro.
AMONG US  OMG OMG AMOGUS 7:26
Okay well now I'm scared about the possibility of future generations making the last of us irl
The book Upgrade by Blake Crouch is about this biotechnology topic, its a good read as well
Always my favorite channel ❤❤
I just wish that worst possible humans on earth weren't also the ones who are inevitably given access to use genetically engineered super weapons...or nuclear bombs....or all the money...or control over the laws....
Ferb i know what we're gonna do today
Then again, we should be careful on how much we put things behind closed doors. There is a saying “in the land of the blind, the one who sees is king” and that is very true, information is much more valuable the less available information there is
it's tiktokers
The next biggest threat might very well be in a nutshell
4:44 Quick joke on the second magazine - Journal: "jou-RNA-l, get it?"
Nice propaganda video!
Advocating for the restriction of information and tracking people who know such information? Pretty tyrannical, regardless of the "good intentions". Historically, it's governments that commit atrocities through abuse of information (and do so, in part, by restricting it)
We Need Something Like NPT for Biotech Immediately
Does any one saw batshìt in 4:45 ??
Internet is the greatest invention ever
@NileRed did that. He did make a nuclear bomb in his parents garage...well afterwards he did ask mark rober for help and forever revolutionized amateur home chemistry
I see what you did there with the bat. Nuance.
I was just thinking about it....we live in a golden age of information. Children have been able to build nuclear reactors in their backyards and we can easily find how to hack a wifi/create a virus with an online search. I wonder if far in the future, people will Marvel how easily we could find information on certain sensitive subjects because in their time, those things are censored
Where are the ducks. Why aren't there any ducks in this video. Where did they go
Was this video sponsored by bill gates? And the WHO?
Honestly can’t wait for the day we completely control human biology, on top of curing virtually all diseases, it should be amazing news for trans people with how easy transitioning would become
what's the relationship between the little bird duck creatures and humans in kurzgesagt lore
I got an ad right at the start of the video and it said "Are you watching a Kurzhgesagt video?" I got scared.
this just brings more Plague Inc flashbacks.
thanks kurzgesagt! thanks to this video, i will make a nuclear bomb in my backyard and test it out
Having a rule for such an thing my be scary but not having it is scaryer
Wow, I guess you don't get American government reports in Germany, eh? The US government admitted creating it in a lab over a year ago, bro
'Not Nuclear' Well technically it is.
As you said, bio technology is neither good or bad. It has the potential to be good, or bad (you guys didn't say this, but I did). In fact, everything in this world are....    Including humans.
is is an OSHA video
You guys are living legends in media , keep doing dudes 👍🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️
brought to you by the gates foundation.
Still can’t cure hairloss
(:
Restricting genetic information will be completely impossible straight up. Uramium is a lot easier to restrict since it is much simpler to account for and regulate as it is a physical thing. Refining and enriching weapons grade uranium also is a very difficult and costly process. Genetic information can be sent anywhere by anyone, and be encrypted to become undetectable, can be copied and replicated millions of times, and stored practically anywhere. Basically it is impossible to regulate, and given Hackers, Leakers, Dataminers it wouldn't even be able to stay secret.
So glad that covid (flu, whatever) vaccine worked out so amazingly well.
But don’t wipe out all viruses though, as we need some to keep our immune system active.
You just said our biggest benefit was sharing data with everyone but now your recommendation is to censor knowledge so only the rich have it?
Can you please talk a little about the potential bird flue epidemic? It seems concerning and awareness is easily enhanced with your large platform.
I wonder what Kurzgesagt has to say about Gain of Function research, and the people accused of practicing something so dangerous.
You know damn well it came from a lab..
the susmogus
hm.... what about mandating vaccines be developed for viruses before you post their DNA online? so that way if there is an outbreak of it you can simply release the vaccine?
propaganda
Creed of human kind will doom us all...
I also don’t think that I should be up to the be up to the scientist when Dr. Fauci lied about that shit. There are literally the one who made it and literally the one who released it just as a means to see what would happen, and they got away with it and they made money off of it. Politicians scientist anyone with a big name.
Finally, Genomics and Metagenomics is getting the spotlight
Humanity really finds ways to destroy themselves
Whenever I don't feel humanity is hanging by a thread enough I come back to this channel - Kurzgesagt, you never fail to disappoint.      (Jokes aside, the quality and effort put into these videos is unreal and hugely appreciated!)
Working in an elementary school, I wish all (or at least the few that I'd immediately order) posters were in German and not only in English. 8(
7:25 among us? 🤨
The most destructive weapons are lies, paranoia, and deceit. Unleash them on a population and a country will destabilize and allow for more authoritarian powers to take control.  One does not need to blow everyone up, they just need to convince enough people and they'll do it for you.
I cant believe humanity will get wiped by a Tiktoker who wanted to make a prank virus
So basically Funky Boy from Redline?
That pug dog looks so gross
Climate change is a liberal lie and grift.
Idk pretty sure lab leak is confirmed especially with patient zero being a wuhan lab worker.
How do you destroy a country without destroying the ecosystem with hazardous waste… could it be creating a virus?
Dimensional weapon. Flattening us into lower dimensions. That’ll fuck us up more than anything
So what you're saying is Resident Evil 5 is human canon now?
We already have a weapon capable of being created and deployed by a single individual or terrorist cell with significantly greater ease than a bioweapon, yet this has not yet happened despite being more likely than kurzgesagt's fantasy, so why should we restrict freedom of information if it is futile? It would only make the individual more vulnerable to bioweapons created by large organisations. We have seen with gun/knife/explosive control acts that they don't work past a very limited level. I can't agree with the actions suggested here. This video may as well have been about the dangers of water and electricity as they could be used to create potent high explosives.
While I understand the worry of allowing all of this information be completely free, I think that despite the risk it’s absolutely necessary for information to be accessible. I don’t think vital biological information should be regulated of all the sciences out there. There will be a time when at home we can synthesize our own certified medicines. Restraining this information to “allowed” entities only helps one party: pharmaceutical manufacturers. Viruses can be used as delivery machines for groundbreaking new medicines, research in that field would only be hindered by regulating who gets to see and work with this data. To have the power of biology in everyone’s hands is important. Biology literally is the study of life, it is uniquely personal to all humans. Super not down for limiting its accessibility. Great video otherwise!
I think your line it's going to be pretty tough, kurgesagt, since we are not governments properties.   Good luck enforcing all that stuff "for our own good".
It's ok guys if things get bad ill intervene 💪🏾
I think the new Vaccines are soon coming, immediately we kick putin out of the office. There must be a fine balance of weapon and big pharma lobbies 😂😂😂
Hey! I have that poster! It's so cool. I also got the population density poster, which is my fav and also your 2023 callander! They're all very cool!
Now I have the perfect reason to kill my neighbor
8:12 on the vaccines? are you ready to advocate for the banning of patents? or is did daddy gates tell that thats bad for his bottom line?
Here is my biggest concern. If Bio-tech gets privatised, the rich are basically untouchable. Imagine protests becoming increasingly more violent and desperate because people cannot afford their basic human necessities. The most effecient way to silence all protest is to create basically a eugenics virus that is more likely to target people in poorer communities, and yes this may cripple the elites for a short period, until automation becomes cheaper and more affordable.  And even if it's a fucking stupid idea to begin with because this bio-weapon could kill people with important information or the rich themselves, since when has danger and mass extinction stop them? All they care about is profit and securing that profit, they waged wars in the middle east to get oil, they will fund the millitary industrial complex to ensure their wealth is not taken, they will not hesitate to release another pandemic if it means they can just wait it out in their manors and super clean bunkers whilst everyone else fucking dies a slow and painful death. We need to make precautions to ensure eco-terrorists or the private sector cannot get access to these deadly diseases.  Idk if the stuff mentioned in this video will be enough.
“Hey Ferb, I know what we’re gonna do today!”
I hope Furries don't do anything stupid with genetic engineering.
Kurzgesagt is like a teacher tha is funny and know what they are doing
Good thing none of these viruses make you pale :)
It seems a bit naïve to assume we can contain the spread of biotech anything like we did with Nuclear.  The nuclear situation has the benefit that it's just hard to get hold of or refine uranium is other similar fissile material, and that could be physically enforced, and detected easily. By comparison, with biotech, the building blocks of viruses are a small number of common amino-acids, that exist in all the living material around us. The hard bit is knowing how to assemble them, and that knowledge is just information. If the internet age has taught us anything, it's that information leaks, and once it's out, you can't put that genie back in the bottle.
1. Make people frightened that someone will Frankenstein a new virus. 2. Get politicians to create laws prohibiting home labs. 3. Give all the power and money to big pharma and the government (FDA in the pocket of big pharma) to do research. 4. Watch as actual cures never materialize, but there will be treatments that go on forever. $$$

Keep up the wonderful information and illustrations!
C'mon now. Does anyone really think that any government wants to stop a pandemic? If they did, they'd have no way to control the sheeple.
3:38   I say this as respectfully as I can to everyone here, but im on one side of that argumemt since Fauci had tax dollars going to Wuhan and  then ended up testifying to Congress about the entire situation.   And dont get me started on the heart issues that came with his solution.

I kinda liked the older style where the human characters had faces, but a great vid nonetheless!
Can’t wait for Covid-Pox 91
Ehhhh i dunno.
7:25  ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!! GET OUT OF MY HEAD
“In the end,”  Um, the pandemic has not ended. It’s still here, and still killing people.
It’s weird how you say the Covid virus was broken down within a week yet It was already in a lab at China.
The ad before the video freaked me out
Nice Easter egg of umbrella corporation from Residential evil franchise
0/10 video. No ducks scientist at the start.

The animation in this video is awesome! It’s only getting better!
Well this is another reason why aliens invading earth is not that bad of an idea. Cause we get more kills cause we are gonna end one way or another so why not drag other aliens down hill with us >:)   Jk what I meant was if aliens came to earth, humanity will be busy having war and not do dumb stuff that we very well know kill us all. And after we get alien tech, we will use our newly made weapon on every other aliens that are hostile and we will have new type of entertainment.
"I may don't have a brain gentleman, but I have an idea."
They said among us
The next wave of anti-piracy ads: "you wouldn't download a bioweapon"
No intro?? 😢
Guys, go to 4:42 and pause to read the titles of all 3 "journals" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If you enjoyed this video I would highly recommend a book called The Hot Zone which goes into detail about the Ebola outbreak in the 80s
Thank you for idea.
answer to all the idiots writing i comments about scientists creating the coronavirus problem in the first place: CV existed for thousands of years we are just better at identifying it now and population density and mobility is at highest in history. and recent Rona-19 is actually one of the most mild variants that ever existed. there variants that have very high lethality. so we were actually lucky we got a very light teaser of what we might have to deal with
Why is the intro missing??!
The most dangerous weapon is humanity
This whole thing and how fast the argument goes south is pretty sick. I don't want to hear this shit.
All dangerous viruses went out of stock after this video came out 💀
Did you all saw the Data time add at the beginning?
It was definitely from the lab. And your praise of the vaccine is deplorable. Unfollowed.
Where intro😢
... so, free knowledge is the most destructive weapon. that goes with stupidity, economic interests, carelessness, and why not, chasing likes or views.
They allwayis taught me to use the knollege i learned SO.....
Damn it’s already July, time sure does fly when you have to work everyday.
Why are you making this video??
Everyone should go look into who is funding these kurzgesagt videos.  I was pretty disappointed to find out that this channel is straight up propaganda from billionaires like bill gates
Here before 1st hour!
4:11 No there are vetting processes for legit places. And specific DNA synthesis, while neat, is still complicated enough that it’s prohibitively expensive to try getting from unmonitored sources.
I've never even considered this possibility. New source of dread lol  This is really informative though. Very interesting stuff.
Hmm. Have you been watching strange new worlds?
Why worry about the info and not the means? 🤨 Censorship could be necessary sometimes but really that shouldn't be the first defense? Reeks of think tanks, big govs, capitalism and a hint of fascism.
Where getting to the point where the stuff we're making is barely even understandable. Like it turned into the discovery/study of gravity and simple machines to how to extract banana dna for no reason.
Always appreciate Kurzgesagt, but don’t forget that 80,000 hours and other orgs like it are the kinds of groups that empowered SBF to rob millions of people. You don’t have be an EA to save the world.
tedydy5eytfyuft
who tf want to make a world ending virus
That would be your mother
Hey y'all have a great day!
Kurzgesagt is incredible.
I wonder what part of Kurzgesagt's board pushed for this topic, and how much they were paid to push for it.
Great solutions - one problem.  We also need to get a serious handle on misinformation.  Republicans (mostly) were anti-mask, anti-vaccine, etc and with roughly 45% of the US being republican, only about 55% of the total population was vaccinated, even with readily available vaccines, and masks were rare and poorly worn (usually on purpose).  Misinformation destroys any progress from these ideas and spreads freely without repercussions.  In addition, misinformation pays well enough (financially and politically) to be basically inevitable under the current system.  The US is one of the worst cases, but the world has this problem.
COVID RACCOONS!?!?
i was supporting this channel since they had like 4 million subs
"...up to scientific debate..." and yet "the science community" with suspicious ties to that particular lab's executives dismissed any possibility, several weeks before a pandemic state of emergency became official.  Shit even the UN agency responsible for declaring biological state of emergency has suspicious ties to "that" government.   The evidence is the actions taken by parties of interest.
Hi
this video is going to age well
8:20 "schrodinger's biotechnology" TM 😂😂
Casually out here describing Apple's deepest nightmare
Can we appreciate the joycons on the desk here? 5:08
It's all fun and amazing till someone decides to play Plague INC. in real life with the knowledge and equipment they caneasily come into thier possession
The way you depict the population centers in Australia is insane, have a look at the population distribution in Australia, there is almost nobody in Australia except the east coast and a little on the south west coast
Oh so COVID may have originated from a lab? I didn't know Kurzgesagt jumped on a conspiracy theories wagon.
Who has watched Kurgesagt for more than 1 year   👇
Thanks for teaching me how to cause anarchy
love u kurzgesagt
Kurzgesagt always has me covered for my world ending schemes
Ah yes, the entity funded by the Gates preaching about dangers of open sharing of technology. Very nice
:o
hi
Didn't all the investigations resulted in statements that covid did not originated in lab. Why are you misinforming people?
Wow, your videos are so amazing and explain complex things in a very simple way. Your animations are so good. I love your black hole and space series videos. I hope further you can make more videos(space like).
KURTZGESAGT HOW MANY VIDEOS CAN YOU MAKE IN 1 MONTH WAT
When i was about watch this but a ad pop up that literally know that i was about to watch a data based video 😐😐😐
My dog dead
ok
Eventually, major parts of the world will have to be equiped with a powerful sensors and automatic labs capable of analysis of biosamples in real time. When the most deadliest bio weapons are being detected in matter of hours, it will be far less interesting to develop and use them, even by deranged. Especially if response are effective, quick and near effortless for a society. That would require a lot of automatisation and effective, well aligned AI systems, not to mention infrastructure cost. We can think about it as a global insurance.
Like Hunter X Hunter
It came from a lab, internal documents from china revealed that the first people infected with Covid were scientists from that very lab
40k was right again virus bombs are in our future lol
Its not nuclear, its not a virus, its tiktok, it has infected millions of innocent lives and only SOME of them get cringy…..
I want someone to make a steak plant. Not only would it greatly reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released without requiring that people give up most of their meat consumption and free up large swaths of land for other purposes, but the idea of a field of strange plants twitching at random to tone the muscles they're growing is the kind of creepy that I can get behind.
What if the most dangerous weapon in the world is living elephant toothpaste
Bio nuclear weaponry is scary on paper. A pathogen that is exposed to the radiation would make it presumably stable to any possible cure and probably affect it rate of reproduction as well as amp some other aspects, like decreasing it rate of detection by internal/external means and speed with which it may become lethal
ppl don't realize how stupidly dangerous the situation is. we are mostly saved by the fact that viruses that are too good at killing selfrgulate towards milder variants.
One cannot believe that a random guy obsessed with doing a world apocalypse can release a virus from his home.
"Order dangerous DNA" Oh brother... How you've fallen.
Da king is back baby he neva miss
I really don't like the new animation style and I don't like help the ducks are only at the very end and the humans economy we're looking I really like the old style only some criticism of my opinion
Security through obscurity, that's really not the way to go Kurzgesagt.  Doesn't dismiss what is mentioned but I believe u should be mindful of that mindset.
7:26 hahh
uv lamps? isnt this like...giving you cancer? xD
4:07 bro just downloaded virus
The coronavirus originated from the Wuhan Chinese lab, the next one will also come from a lab. Biological warfare is a massive threat to humanity, it has already been used by China.
Not even an hour has passed an already almost 200k views. Kurzgesagt has a really good fanbase... and for good reason! Fantastic video as per usual
The most dangerous weapon in the universe is your mom's flip flops, most moms can hit an ant from miles away, let alone the lightning speed of the throw.
Kurzgesagt is such a great organization. Thank you for your service. I love your work.
Fighting with vaccines isnt all that useful when there are so many who have decided to believe conspiracy theories instead of science though .
0:55 "The unknown Corona virus" Pretty sure there were some lab people who knew about it.
This, but each time "biotechnology" is said, say "AI".
these animations are better than most low quality animes
Let's be real a scientist would infact not freely share the equivalent of a nuke in biological data, they are not stupid. Also all the other measures here are bit misguided when it comes use as a terror weapon as nukes haven't been used by terrorists. Weapons of mass destruction first face the greater filter of states actually developing them into weapons which is to be monitored first and foremost, before getting conspiratorial about somebody doing anything in a shed.
I like how this video nearly times with reports of COVID-19 being a bio-weapon...
1:11 do you have like sources for that? most sources say they started making the vaccine in 2019 before the outbreak.
So everyone just ignoring the fact kurzgesagt sweared in a video for the first time 4:47
"The unknown coronavirus" We knew where it came from, it came from a lab. Remember that?
3:50 that’s the umbrella corporation…
I am honestly so incredibly excited to see our naive sci-fi beliefs of the future actually come true!
It's basically the same argument with AI. You can'ts top progress, and doing bad with it will get easier and easier so we need to use the technology itself towards preventing and stoping the bad things that can be done with it
The greatest threat to humanity is apathy!!
Screw the person that might do that in that case we should just make people only be able to buy viruses on online if they are a scientist but that mean they could just lie so we just need to make them only available on in labs so you can make sure that nothing can happen
The fact that even a 5-year-old can now test their one-of-a-kind, highly experimental "bomb" just by the technology of today really just shows how powerful biotech especially can be. I can already imagine the requirements, with the first one being an underrated YouTube video. Oh man... the imagination's already getting darker.
I'm gonna make a nuclear bomb later
Kurzgesagt getting onboard with the authoritarians.
This is the only kind of GMO I'm concerned about lol. A Bioengineered virus coded to affect only black people. A virus designed to only cause humans to enter a rabies-like state.....  But we have people pitching a fit in stores over their GMO corn...... Lady, literally every plant and animal we eat, in America and most of modern society, is a GMO.  You think chickens naturally weigh 12 lbs?  You think all carrots get big and straight? No, it's all GMOs. Literally everything is a GMO at this point and nobody seems to be having issues......
No opening ? No ducks ? Is that a new format ?
1:13 bro the wheels on the chair💀💀💀 ain’t that supposed to be three?
This video seems to be fear-mongering propaganda to clamp down on access to knowledge/technology. Similar pushes are being made in fields like AI.
Thanks for a good video with some ideas about how to deal with a threat that some would deny even existed.
Ok
I'd really like to buy a poster but you're not selling any poster *frame* to go along with it. I don't want to damage it :<
with covid-19, we've seen what happens when step 2: detect fails, as the pandemic probably could've been outright prevented if the virus running free had been communicated publicly as soon as it was noticed, and the proper measures had been taken. but this didn't happen and had been delayed, causing a lot of death all around the globe.
I love your art, voice and accent, attention to accuracy, your philanthropic donations, and even the cartoon sounds are great.  I will get one of those calendars some day - 🤘🤩👍
Props for the left-handed Precision bass guitar!
2020 showed us very well
I will biuld one and bomb the planet.
So we're so advanced yet we don't have a cure for cancer? Something doesn't seem right
Indonesia subtitle plisss
He said... he said among us 7:24
Hopefully it was created in a lab and that case we can just blame the Chinese
There is nothing better than sittong on a balcony with a view at the mountains, and waching kurzestagt video about the weapons of mass destruction ❤
Kurzgesagt comment is 1 day old while the video is 51 minutes old
We do know for sure that Covid came from a lab now, the only question is whether it was intentionally leaked or not.
most wholesome outro ever :') love you Kurzgesagt, thank you for everything you do and for putting all your heart, soul and so much brain into it <3
So nothing to worry about from the mad and bad of the world...
But what about our immune system? I mean all those gadgets probably will weaken it.
Cool Umbrella reference!
Covid might of been a blessing in disguise. It was bad enough to put a fire under policy maker's seats, yet not so extreme as it could be if we let bio research continue to go parabolic unchecked
ok im only half way through the video and it says these man handled viruses can be sold to anyone online with almost no tracking and yall worried about A.I. taking over
It probably wont work against a being of Chaos though, Rylanor tried it against Fulgrim and the phoenician just got remade back by the ruinous powers. RIP Rylanor, you will always be remembered as one of the Emperor's finest.
There was no intro this time.(Yeah I notice a lot lol)
Killing and filtering the viruses around us would actually make it easier to create a pandemic.
this is our nuclear bomb....
if someone buys or makes a virus that can kill humanity, and uses it, hes basically doing suicide, using that, we know that only emos and highly depressed people will actually release a virus like that, and most of people arent criminals too, so the chances of a dangerous virus made by a human that kills humanity are even lower, the thing is that it all doesnt matter cuz there are 8 billion people in the world and there will be more, so all i just said is useless
Can we make a vaccine against conspiracy theory paranoia?
Yet we haven't discovered the cure for HIV. Till then, I'm not impressed.
then again, tracking the danger is a very bad thing aswell, people don't like to get indoctrinated, and at the same time by tracking all that, the governments could abuse it not to the benefit of society, but to the benefit of themselves, and how much money they get, after all that's what they are doing right now. George Orwell's 1984.
It worked!
Gecko
I refuse to have kids, the end is near!!!!!
one of the best channels out there.
Thanks for the monthly anxiety attack 👍
I kind of imagine big biocorp being sued by a government and in response they don't respond to accusations but instead mention that they have data how to release 1000 different super-diseases. And maybe just to make a point, they release just one of them. Now that sounds like taking humanity as a hostage.
7:24 okay 📮
WEF and WHO funded. They've lied for years. We know the COVID-19 was leaked from the Wuhan lab. Don't trust the CCP. Unless you're brain dead.
hahha we dont know if it came form a bat .. or "accidental' .. Keep the propagnada alive Kurz...
Can’t wait to experiment and make my own bio weapon. Thanks for the information!
Where do the scientists share their knowledge on? Is there a site?
The plandemic was made in a lab, that’s how they made the “vax” so quick, our governments don’t care about us
I just learnt some chinese labs have discovered a way to create the first mouse son of 2 male parents. They removed the genetic code of the ovum and replaced with the spermatozoon code. Awesome 1st step for a new race of something very weird
haah umbrella reference
Will someone use Biotech to turn people into lizards?
Ah yes, the only channel that can make me fear for my life (and the world as a whole) and then calm me down remarkably quickly
Kurzgesagt always give no.1 content with all the facks check, please continue what you are doing @kurzgesagt 💖
no intro?
Kurzgesagt is getting money from Open Philanthropy? Ugh. Of all the ways to compromise your work. Really disappointed.
this video contradicts itself!  if sequencing dna is getting exponentially easier, then why do they later say that it'll be effective to close source any 'potentially dangerous' mapped sequences? Just seems like an excuse to centralize more power, at the long term detriment of the public.  nice animations as always tho lol
Can’t wait for someone to create Green Poison from The Division 💀
3
i wouldnt count on it, since people still struggle differentiating between XX and XY
I can imagine some 6 year old trying to make fire-breathing bats in their tree house.
So out of all the futures we can imagine, we’re on the cusp of the “Resident Evil” future where corporations, governments, and rouge agents and terrorists spread bio-weapons all over the world.
So we can do all this but we can’t figure out how to get lower gas prices
Im pretty sure this was like emphasized in the Resident Evil series. The single cause of all of the tragedy within the series was because of a Bio-Organic Weapon
Kruzgesagt has helped me learn things easier and quicker!! Thank you!
Boycott Bill Gates agenda
I really don’t like the idea of biological engineering maybe it’s because I like biology and I would prefer to see it take it’s natural course or because it can easily get very dangerous but most likely a combination of both but what can I do besides hope ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
So basically, Plague Inc, but really real this time.
People have been warning about the end of the world since people could talk. I'm not too worried about it. What is more common, and concerning, is the withholding and censership of information. It makes sense to make it difficult to acquire the materials to make a nuclear weapon, but anyone with interest can look up the process and learn something. Perhaps biotech should be similar.
I just watch The Thought Emporium and man was it a horro within comprehension
is that optimism, I'm sensing
141k views in 50 mins🙌🙌🙌🙌That's wild!!!!!
SCARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHERE ARE THE BIRDS
plague inc irl
Re refrence noice, hopefully someone wont cause such stuff as told here
Yay
This video is great and really well explained, but it's been more than a year since your app got updated, update it!
I can't believe we finally unlocked creative mode
I don't think the issue would be it getting out, I think it's media and social response to the disaster.  With the pandemic that was Covid-19, most of the spread was the denial of it's existence and skepticism.
@4:33   Who else thought that microscope was looking pretty derpy.
Kinda sad about the lack of birds in this video
I'm glad you guys uploaded another informative content 😎
Wait so it kinda comes out that we're the only ones with the power to change ANYTHING in nature it is cool but also scary😢 Cause if there was just a simple mistake just a single step out of line and we could end our entire civilization and probably destroy it so much that every life from will have to start over and that is the scary part! THANK YOU SO MUCH KURZGESAGT you're the ones who inspierd me to learn more about sience and especially about space like "how long could a red dwarf stay glowing?" Or "What happened if we nuke the moon?" AND you answered the questions but i have a question... What would happen if we shot about a hundred thousand nukes to the sun or any other star and detanated them before they get melted(Or what ever else happens) and just see what the effects would be like if we did that? Anyways i love this channel this channel's amazaing keep ul the good work have a good rest of the time of the universe when it's not gone and after that!❤
AMOGUS
The day that I become a space marine draws ever closer.
I understand, that this video should be somewhat philosophical and naive in a sense, but with the iPhone metaphone, I think it overshoot a little. Being an expert in a field is never as easy, as building up from elements just as Lego. Also I totally get the technological viewpoint of the video about advancements, but I think a more social would fit the topic more than just daydreaming about technology not being affordable to the masses (and never be). Like when we got covid, the problem was not that people couldn't have masks, or couldn't have vaccines, but didn't want to wear masks or didn't want to get vaccinated at the first place. Empathy and great socioeconomical decisions goes a long way, which this video forgets to take into account. I feel like this channel is great to spark some interest, but does so in a so naive way, that it detaches itself from reality. I would like to see more stuff closer to the ground, solving real problems.
Been playing the resident evil series for the first time the past few months. They've lost hundreds of thousands or millions of people by the point of RE6, which is where I am But based on the lore, I suspect that computers in the Resident Evil universe were actually far in advance of what they were in the real world, primarily based on the complexities of the organisms that Umbrella was making. My theory was that they HAD to have had faster computers with more processing power in order to process and compare genetic samples rapidly. So I saw this video while mulling my theory over and making coffee, and thought you guys had scooped an idea for a weapon in a fanfic that I'd been planning somehow. My idea for my RE fanfic involved an MIRV nuke where the dummy missiles meant to help the real nuke escape were each packed with a bioweapon from a different RE game. In the story Wesker would have then set the missile trajectory over multiple major cities, but have them headed for the ice sheets in the equivalent of a feint. Fighter planes try to protect the cities, only for them to have a 75% chance of shooting one down with a zombie or monster making biohazard inside. I think for terrifying, I've outdone my idea for licker bone IEDs as far as ways to get royally screwed in the RE universe. I LOVE that you had an umbrella easter egg. I LOVE that you mentioned infohazards too. So I just had to share the existential white knuckle terror I'd come up with for my brave heroes and heroines to face. XD  If you haven't already, can I suggest a map of viral evolution to go with it? When I was a teenager doing research for school, I found out the CDC had such things, but they all looked horribly boring! I'd love to see how Kurzgesagt draws each virus family. Since you have that cute bacteriophage plushie!
If life is crystallization of solar entropy dispersion, then its clear that nuclear entropy dispersion will adopt at some point; life
As if we don't know what they were doing in the Wuhan lab... This is a joke.
Airborne Rabies…. Coming to a backyard near you!
I am thrilled and eagerly anticipate your videos 😍✨The combination of unparalleled content and captivating animation truly embodies the essence of kurzgesagt 🙌
5:56 in developed countries, wiping out large parts of the population would actually help civilization to advance, since the first ones to go will be the anti-vaxxers who are bringing back polio and whooping cough to their own children. The Venn diagram of anti-vax and general anti-science people is not quite a perfect circle, but it's damned close. The only moral quandary I can see is that people in many developing countries won't even have the choice to vax or not.   Trip on Bill Gates for demanding payment for vaccines in the West, but the prices subsidize vaccines in those other countries wherever possible. The real scary part is when more advanced countries whose citizens enjoy freedom of travel start developing even more vaccine-resistant bugs.
Applicable to Evil AI super intelligence too?  1. Delay AI training 2. Detect new companies doing AI training  3. Destroy AI companies
Ted Kaczynski was the last messenger.  A warning cry before we lost control.
The most dangerous weapon is unchecked government.
Im glad you all talk about some of the worlds problems. You continue to ignore how "stupidity" is contagious and spreading fast.
RIMWORLD REFFERECE /j
Nukes can't evolve on their own, humans can.
Good thing COVID wasn't that great of a bioweapon it wasnt nearly deadly enough with a survival rate upwards of 90% it clearly wasn't finished when it leaked which makes it obvious that it wasn't a intentional leak
Saying that's it's still unclear where the covid 19 virus came from is just disingenuous at best, and cowardly at worst. There was never a shred of evidence that it had a natural origin. All the evidence we do have is that it was manufactured in a Chinese lab and was leaked. The first recorded cases, we now know, were recorded in scientists working at the Wuhan lab...  Maybe the CCP is happy that you continue to tow that line, but it doesn't do anyone else any good to continue to pretend we have no solid clue where covid came from.
Really expensive things got cheap? How could this happen while the inflation is ongoing?
Something something C0v1d19
Time to buy one of those UV lights I've heard so much about
Was playing Resident Evil 3 remake just yesterday, loved the umbrella corp. reference. 3:49
Youtube is drunk again, its saying 1 comment💀💀💀
Someone had fun with the covers of the medical journals. 😂
Everyone knows its Dad's farts. Duh
good, informative and creative as always , they always meet our expectations
I remember when Fringe was a science fiction show, now it is everyday life.
Kurzgesagt revealing my master plan ! D: NO
Let’s be clear Covid 19 was a lab leak. There is plenty of evidence showing it was a cover up.
It's pretty obvious why a bioweapon would be far more destructive than nuclear weapons. After all, you only need to make it self-replicating and deploy it at least once. Nuclear weapons tend to not really be good at duplicating themselves without billions of dollars of investment and deploying them is rather flashy. If anything, the hazy origins of SARS-CoV-1 and -2 should be a warning that if a virus ever gets weaponised, we're unlikely to figure out who did it.  Tracing viruses is much harder than nuclear weapons and radioactive material, too. You can't exactly put a Geiger counter next to a sample to check whether it contains viral matter. And you only may need a tiny vial to kickstart a pandemic that will kill billions. Much better for an end-of-the-world doom scenario than some dinky 'thermonuclear war' scenario that requires at least two superpowers, one of whom is decidedly suicidal.
Something people forget: We were already paying attention and carefull about pandemics before covid.  Covid just showed us that we werent doing enough.
"Nuclear power is meaningless in a world where a virus can kill an entire population and leave its wealth intact." -Delia Surridge, V for Vendetta (film)
*new fear unlocked*
this the stuff of apocolyptic video games and movies
I like the taste of rain
The reason why i study microbiology is this lol
Covid came from Wuhan lab.
I'm gonna make a FAT MAN from FALLOUT 4 rn 🎉
could you use the birds next time to make examples thank you
A yes random individuals are the biggest threat to society. Totally agree. The benevolent government should get dibs on the thechnology.
My opinion of Kurzgesagt just went down some.  The fact that he doesn’t know that Covid-19 came from a lab means he isn’t doing his research.  People were called conspiracy theorists for postulating sick after looking at adequate evidence, and now that it’s been proven and admitted, he still doesn’t know?
I am forced to travel by plane and people coughing and giving COVID one flight out of two. Despite I wear a mask. We learned nothing
Its been pretty obvious that bio weapons are more power
Isn't this a channel about learning and science? Why would you start off with blatant misinformation about Wu-Flu?
kurzgesagt forever.
A thing becoming significantly cheaper and more accessible - creating good and bad applies to AI too. Anyone with access to the internet can use various forms of AI that didn't exist that long ago. AI can be used for good e.g. identifying important patterns like early symptoms of cancer but it can also be used for bad e.g. generated revenge porn. It is neither inherently good or bad but can be used for both. The vest way moving forward is better regulations which are properly enforced to ensure safe and non-malicious AI use.
Reminded me of Alien Covernant where they showed a simillar thing where they also had a bio hacking Virus tool from the Humanoid Creature
One really doesn't realize how crazy the existence of channels like @The Thought Emporiu are
12 Monkeys got it really close.
Dead virus dna dat IS an info hazard. And should be treated as such. Just as the creation of nuclear weapons, or the passwords for a bank, are an info hazard. Everyone who posesses that information is both inndanger and a huge danger themselves. Basically the same as owning a gun. Youre in danger to be shot, asa potentual criminal sees you as a big enough threat to shoot instead of just intimidate. And youre a potentual shooter, simply because you have the tool to shoot.  Same with information.
I was waiting for the usual Kurzgesagt intro for a full two minutes before I realized it wasn't coming
The positive potential mentioned here about biotechnology, is exactly why I want to work in this field
The #1 asset we as humans have is the fact that scientists openly and freely share their knowledge with other scientists.
Likewise, progress in creating viruses also means progress in treating them. Just like the covid vaccines, we may soon be able to developp vaccines in a few days.
im scared now
1:12 That might explain a part of the skepticism around covid-19 vaccines.
Finally a useful usage of block chains (tracking the access to hazardous viruses data)
This is a scenario where blockchain technology could actually be useful (as opposed to unsustainable crypto currency).  7:02
Hello
Somehow the ads now can predict what i watch
It’s crazy to observe how this channel has grown since it’s beginning, I mean, from 1 sub to 20M subs is not easy, so congrats on the way here, I love you vids <3
6:24 the train has a happy face!
The coronavirus was spread from a leak in a Chinese Wuhan lab... The thing up for debate was if the United States government asked for it to happen or just let it happen that's all that's up for debate
4:45  yoyoyoyoyo what's that title of the top book???!?!?!?
labs in china be celebrating after hearing about this
I am disappointed that Kurzgesagt is anti free and open sharing of science.
wake up babe, new kurzgesagt video just dropped
The most dangerous weapon is AI.
Paywalling knowledge is a terrible solution no matter the consequences of not doing so.
OMG new kurz video! Interesting that there are no intro :>
Mate, it's only a matter of time before we figure out a way to stop aging.
Now i'm 100% you guys are funded from billionaires around the world to peddle their agenda and impose it on public 😅
Plague Inc 2
This is the first time I have seen kurzgesagt not putting their intro
Viruses? What about genetically modified fungi?
4:45  i think that's the first swear word in kurzgesagt's history "new batshit virus discovered" On god
No worries! When have big corporations used their captive scientists and captive government regulatory regimes to earn billions while sickening and killing millions of people? As long as we have people like Dr. Fauci, who took over as top medical officer in the US at a time when Americans were some of the least healthy people on the planet, and under his careful pharmaceutical-driven oversight Americans are now the healthiest people on Earth, we'll all be fine! Here - have a Prozac if you're worried.
EARLY WOHHOOO
Amazing, as always.
Present “among us” lol
we already saw it, the rna spike booster for covid, bad move.
Its a breathtaking that Kurzgesagt upload more often
not to mention the virus was also made in one XD
Takes 5 minutes to learn how to bash someone's head with a hammer but 5 years to build a house with said hammer. Its the same for every tools. Takes a lot more time to learn how to use a tool for good.
So spiderman when ?
kurzgesagt really spoiling us with 3 uploads in a short period of time >_<
"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. So is a lot." Albert Einstein.
"unknown Coronavirus" 😂
We’ll just all pretend the Covid vaccine wasn’t already being researched before the pandemic ok. And I guess it didn’t come from a lab wither
ahhh yes   "we still dont know where Cvid came from"  sure.... sure....
So many pop culture references in this video: - Mr. DNA from Jurassic Park - The radioactive spider that bit Peter Parker - Umbrella Corporation from Resident Evil - A Pokémon card - A Shakespeare quote from Hamlet  Did I miss any?
We should probably learn how to make vaccines that don’t kill people first. Otherwise there’s not much point.
Dooooooooooooooooooooomed.   That's what we do. Build domes. Live domed. Dome compromised, 3, 2, 1... implode.
One of the great filters.

I hope we can improve cats attitudes with this new technology
3:16 Nile green be like
After this video I feel like It's time to buy some Pfizer stock
8:25 nahhh litteraly covid 💀💀💀
I wanna make a virus but i dont wanna get infected with it so ill stay away from that
when we cure cancer we will also be able to create things much worse
Ngl limitong information inatead of teaching proper precautions is dumb. Legit ya cant control and track info without incentivizing criminal activity. Teach people to respect the tools theyre using and give em tos to read. If they dont treat biotech like a gun with care and consideration they'll be irresponsible. Give more information not less. Also what about governments who limit knowledge and the spread of said knowledge on subject matter. If anything open source stuff on bioengineering prevents one party from controlling the narrative. I like your channel but what you're encouraging is more dangerous than the super bugs.
Could we just not do that? Thank you!
HOW DID THE AD KNOW I WAS WATCHIN THIS CHANEEL?!?!?!
Already being primed for the next pandemic, whenever it accidentally happens on total accident. Ready with the toilet paper this time.
Bro they messed with the wrong birbs 9:23 💀
Ok ...saying we don't know where it came from when you know it came from a lab is bullshit.  Stop kissing Chinese communist ass.
what if i do
AHHHHHHHHHHHAHHAHAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
We have tremendous tools to detect and defeat new pandemics.  We also have supercharged tools of denial, anti-science and misinformation.  A political system that rewards leaders for feeding stupidity, denying experts and confirming anti-science.  Several decades now of the internet allowing ill-informed opinions to spread and mutate and a complacent fact-checking mechanism that didn’t see the harm in really dumb ideas.
7:26 When the virus is sus
It makes perfect sense that all the data on viruses and diseases are very accessable. But that all of it, down to the dna seqyences and methods of creation, is accessable to anyone? That IS a very bad idea!  Yes, keep me informed and give me access to data that I need, both for myself and so I know ehat you do with that potentually dangerous virus. But dont hand me the virus itsself! Im not qualified fir that.
1:08 - uh huh.... 🙄 Vax that inoculated no one
Waiting for pharma companies to accidentally release something with a vaccine in their fridge. Now, won't that be profitable! Any government intervention should first catalogue their virus bank
since kurzgesagt mention how fast vaccine for covid-19 been developed, I wonder why can't we developed vaccine for HIV especially since it's been several decades
Never heard of buying dna sample, I’ll take a note of that.
The Scenario of the videogame "The Division" is, as far as I know, exactly this. Someone created a disease and introduced it to humans on black friday via cash
Kurzgesagt promoting ban on private medical research:
I mean, the smallpox sequence is on the web. And given that a lot of people in western countries are no longer vaccinated against it and how deadly it is, perhaps the blueprints are there already.
Pls do one about the excess mortality rates since the pandemic years
A video about the potential threat of a Grey Goo scenario and its anti virus countermessure, the Blue Goo would be interesting!
We are just trusting human ethics
Where's the intro???

Tracking people for downloading a paper.. I think this is beyond crazy 😂😂😂
Please explain the poster with "stars trek and sneeze"
7:26 sus
Don't take this comment offensively Covid-19 is terrible thing that happened but wanna share opinion on other side of coin.  When you look on Covid-19 other way, you could say  we can be  thankfull for it. Because as Kurzgesagt said in video we will probably face more of those viruses in the future and they can be incredibly dangerous so I would say that Coivid-19 was nice experience for us to how to deal with it more effectively and help us create a lot more technology that will help us deal with similar cases in future. :D (Hopefully nothing similar or worse will come 😅)
the most dangerous virus is the greed of big pharmaceutical corporations, millions already die and suffer with hope for more in the future
I believe they did confirm that covid-19 did come from a lab leak.
the most dangerous weapon is ideology
I feel like bio security is in order
This is why I can never take any alien invasion movies seriously. If an alien truly want to eradicate us, there are so many easier and more efficient ways to kill us than just sending in their troops. Our civilization is basically a castle of cards, one thing fail and the whole thing will collapse. Just imagine if suddenly crops around the world mysteriously die just for 1 year we will see more chaos than WW2.
The most dangerous weapon is a government
This is truly a sus amongus moment
UV lamps that kills all viruses the air? Am I the only one who sees how that’s a bad idea???
This reads a lot like probaganda for why "only select few should have access to progress"
“Mooooooom, phineas made an artificial virus that can kill millions so he can sell the vaccineeee.”
Ok
1) I think the final verdict was COVID escaped the lab. Patients zero, one, and two were all lab workers per recent documentation.  2) I feel like we kind of learned our lesson on rushing vaccines. I know Trump was trying to stop the pandemic in its tracks, but the risks of untested vaccines are still with us (especially in the least vulnerable, younger populations) long after the pandemic has ended.
No wonder a certain country didn’t want the country next to it making these
Crazy how much power humans could possibily have.
Come on, no proper break down on covid?
6:44  NileRed: yea...
I don't normally get concerned when kurzgesagt releases a new video,  but I think this one is gonna be very dangerous in the hands of Q-Anon and doomsday bunker conspiracy "theorists"
2:35 that will never happen cuz apple is against the right to repair any of their stuff. greedy draconian bastards will never get a cent from me
Thanks Kurzgesagt for the tip!  EDIT: calm down, FBI agent, it's a joke
Surelly bill Gates paid for this episode...
Big pharma made so much money from Covid, it's not wild to think they will release the virus
Every statement, inventions, knowledge, etc. Will always 2 outputs. Good or Bad. Because humans are not perfect.
itll be great
7:26 AMONG US
Perhaps the best defense against exploiting biology is to rely on human conscience. Some people love dogs and cats more than humans, and those who go too far hate their own kind. We need to make sure people like other people.
I'd love to see a video from y'all about the potential the ongoing biotech revolution offers to change our lives for the better, too! I'm hoping vaccines are just the beginning ✨
bill gates must be afraid of rogue bio terrorists then

7:26 NO GET OUT GET OUT OF MY HEAD! PLEASE!
7:05 hmmm, if a reality, this would be interesting to see go against freedom of information laws in countries (where, by US law, citizens can request public govt information and it be provided freely). Assuming there would be dangerous information that is contracted/done by (for example) US govt, and the procedure would be obvious to follow by anyone who requests the info.
i mean, nukes themselves were something of mass destructiona nd the smartest people in the world whom new of the dangers couldnt stop them from being used to being with. Who knows such scenario might happen again?..
You can use artificial intelligence for making the videos

Over like... twenty seconds of scientific *fact.*  And one of the greatest medical achievements in recent DECADES. So F-U, to any loser that just got very angry science has dismissed crystals bathed in urine, or what freakin' ever.
The most dangerous weapon is probobly asian moms when you talk back to them
Very useful
This year's covid summit's first speaker really puts into perspective this topic amazingly.
leave it up to kurzgesagt to advocate for more surveilance, restriction of information, and government overreach.
huh, what happened to the faces
What I'm really worried about is the assault on education in my country.  Certain people are trying to drag us backwards and destroy what makes us great.
So, technically Humanity have a chance of re-creating Changed plot in a nutshell
What is there to debate?
4:46 cought red haned "batshit"
The only problem is that a lot of extremely motivated potential bioterrorism don't have enough friends of a specific ethnic group to test the virus they made on
For me, the scariest part about biotechnology is the breakneck speed it's developing at, leading to problems with regulation. When nuclear technology was in development, progress was somewhat slow and extremely restricted. This laid some groundwork for regulations on the technology to be created. But for biotechnology, regulations are struggling to keep up, not to mention the extent of the interconnectivity of the world, sharing information for generally good intentions. Our biggest hurdle is to develop the morals which surround biotechnology, which is even harder than nuclear, since it's tied so closely with us.  Thank you, Kurzgesagt for bringing this issue to light! 🌏
5:45 Dr. Stone reference!
Scientists really be playing plague inc out here
Dont give me ideas..
Nuclear is the perfect fuel       Countries hiding all the nuclear waste: 😏
Cool vid
Even if the world is kind of a nasty place for now, I still think we're in the best timeline 🤔 I'd like more people to be responsible, but things seem to go in the right direction
one of the most informative and transparent channels out there. keep doing what your doing, clearly its working.
plz phill
Literally couldn't give a worse example of biology masterclass than covid vaccines.
3:33 Yes, we *DO* know for sure that it was an accidental leak from a bio lab. And we know which one.   The first case of sickness was registered at _just a street away_ from an advanced biotech lab in Wuhan that specialised in researching gain-of-function in bat-derived corona viruses. Gain-of-function research is a *highly controversial technique,* as it is considered extremely risky to be purposefully making dangerous viruses gain functions to see how they can become even more dangerous, and thus, gain-of-function virus research is illegal in a lot of the world.   It is _not_ illegal in China, however, which is why unscrupulous scientist have located their research there. *The WHO-liaison Peter Daszak* who said “there is no sign that it came from a lab”, *is **_himself_** one of the actual co-owners* of the Wuhan gain-of-function corona virus lab. Of course he’d say that! It’s his own lab!  Saying “we don’t know what happened” is like following a trail of blood into an axe-murderer’s house, seeing blood all over the walls and ground and on the murderer himself, as well as on cut-out news articles and diplomas put up everywhere complementing his axe-chopping technique, and on the axe itself in his hand, and then taking his word at face-value when he says “Uh I have like nooo idea what happened here you guys, I have nothing to do with it, no need to look any further into this, I’m sure it was all just a natural accident”.
I love this channel so much
this is the weapon i’m going to use against people still using the fatherless meme, thanks
Hmm... the "most dangerous" weapon is a relativistic strike weapon. That is, an impactor moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. A few of those could crack open the Earth's crust and obliterate all life on the planet, even down to the bio-engineered viruses and bacteria.
Huh, TIL. T. I. L.
Such is life, it is what it is, live what life you got
You could start by telling you current billionaire sponsors to stop supporting warmongers.
Scary that the thing more deadly than anything else is ourselves
AMAZING VIDEO AS ALWAYS <3
Covid came from a lab we proved it
make a vid about what if the moon was really made of cheese ive always wondered about that

Here's an idea, let's not sell extremely dangerous viruses or information related to them online AT ALL.

Message is ok, propaganda is not, covid was a wuhan leak confirmed by the us intelligence agencies, we know you shill for bill gates so it's not surprising
Lulz at umbrella corp reference.
Goooooooood vid
OH NO, WE KNOW! FU XINA
Me:how does this work?  Kurzgesagt: WeLL......ITs ComPLICAted
Let's celebrate this historic achievement! 🎉🎉🎉
35 minutes
The most dangerous weapon is the friends we made along the way
The funny thing is people won't care for them as long as they function properly but if one fails everyone would loose their minds ..
Didn't even include the intro. Must be quite urgent. [edit]: Nanofilters can actually pull double-duty as both a method of monitoring and a method of eradication! Also, that UV lamps idea would work quite well if we use the range of UV that our bodies need to produce vitamin D, though exposure time would need to be limited because it damages us just as much as it damages the microbes. Expect to see an uptick in skin cancer wherever they're used.
So you're saying... we can play the IRL equivalent of Plague Inc. now. That's sick.
We're also very likely on the precipice of reverse engineering of proteins meaning we can just straight up inject the correct antibodies/mRNA into someone and the virus will cease near immediately
Interesting how the COVID-19 lab leak theory has gone from "ridiculous and absurd" to "well, it's not 100% scientifically proven quite yet" while it's been completely obvious to any thinking person from the beginning.
Animation is good but message is skewed to benefit the West's bio labs.
Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today
4:45 New Batsh*t Virus Discovered
Gimme tool to control soros
i'm SO happy i was scrolling around on youtube
I think it will be something similar to the internet but for genetics. At first, it'll be a decentralized wild west where pretty much anything could happen. But eventually, just like with the internet, it will get centralized into a few companies doing most of the work.
Let’s just hope the anti-mask people don’t do their thing again!

This video was awesome! Keep up the excellent work Kurzgesagt!
Is there a reason for no intro?

This video gave me an idea  Time to get a lap rat pet for (EDUCATIONAL) purposes
New vid pog
the work and care that goes into these videos and transpires through the rest of the business is awe inspiring.
Looking forward for that day that this channel will create it’s first ever museum-like, merch store space.
The Division game series is the good fictional representation of how EPPP(Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogen) are created and spread/destroy the world. The Dollar Flu is basically a cocktail of “mix in genetic codes of other diseases and you move the slider all the way on lethality and virulence” with the smallpox virus as a base.  FYI, the genome for the 1918 Spanish Flu, Variola Major (Smallpox), Rabies, Marburg,etc… are freely avaliable online with a quick search on google
I hope some idiot wipes us all out sooner than later
What a predictable subject to address after the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation take over of the channel. So sad to acknowledge how sciece becomes propaganda under the wrong tutelage.
I got flash backs from the cotton scene
I JUST GOT AN AD THAT PREDICTED THAT I WAS WATCHING YOU WHAT
Pls heart
Create anti uc aka umbrella corporation and use UV lamps
🐒🐵🙊🙈 🙉🐒🐵🙊 🙈🙉🐒🐵
1:12 Creation of the coronavirus vaccine was hardly sudden. It was a new disease that just happened to fit neatly into research - into RNA vaccines, into different coronaviruses- that had been ongoing for decades.

How good is the information that is shared? During covid the lies were far more wide spread than the truth
of course they reference umbrella
I wonder if the guys out in Wuhan are watching this one?
This honestly just feels like you're trying to push some agenda. Citation needed to take any of your claims seriously
Lost me at "unknown corona virus"....
How can you say you are not a bill gates propaganda channel, when you get sponsored by them, in most of these videos
It sounds like we're ever closer to a Great Filter. I don't feel like our current crop of politicians are up to the job (In the USA).
Blowing away most of the world's population, would certainly put a dampener on humans' global warming project. And reduce the drain on non renewable resources too. Might even bring the era of mass extinction to an abrupt end. Hmmm. 🤔
It was leaked from a lab. It was gain-of-function research.
The most dangerous weapon is the mind. Mega Intercontinental Nuclear Device.
Humanity has reached a point in its development when we must be very careful with our technologies. Everything has a downside, both bad and good, nuclear energy is a very large resource of green energy to which humanity has not yet found the key. We need to create institutions and alliances to prevent world and ordinary wars, we need to come to a common agreement between the countries that hold a nuclear bomb, perhaps, no matter how strange it may sound, America and other countries need to stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, enter into peace negotiations with Putin and divide the land.
This made me terrify and never going out to my bedroom.. 😭😭
Damn since when and most importandly how can you upload so damn often i Remember when you postet 4 Times a yr and it was an Event like christmas. Not like im complaining tho thus just means more amazing Videos Keep it up!
Downloading a virus has a whole new meaning
Cool so the moral of the story is we need a global surveillance state to make sure corrupt war mongering governments have a monopoly on designer bio weapons.
As a big fan of the channel, I'm very irritated. This video is so naïve that you have to ask yourself which audience it is aimed at. Has something of the early American 'duck an cover' videos on how to behave in the event of a Russian nuclear attack. The approach of information suppression as a means of preventing proliferation alone must be rejected in principle. Quite apart from the fact that this would not apply to maliciously acting state institutions anyway. I hope this quality will not become the editorial standard for future contributions.
Allways love it when you guys upload!
I miss the times where Kurzgesagt videos weren't almost always catastrophising.
It crashed the market
Istvaan Moment
3:35 I can't believe you would be spread a far-right, white supremacist, conspiracy theory that the COVID-19™ virus possibly came from a lab! YouTube should shut your account down, in accordance to Bill Gate's, world governments, and WEF wishes!
Wy is there a caterpie in the background att 05:08 into the vidio?
Just got a job in a lab working on this as a freshman in college with no experience 😅. So I guess they are just letting anyone do it.
Best solution: make a cure and vaccine before releasing it to the public
Fr ong
Love it❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
90K views in 30 min is no joke keep up the good work
like china virus 19?
If the markets repeat the corona crash and recovery each time ... Then .. that would be fun 😂
I worry that this video, or similar ideas, could motivate attacks on scientists in the future.
Kurzgezagt and Veritasium new vids in one day? Hell yeah!!
COVID-19 everyone?
Wow
An iPhone you can repair you say? XD
1. Global warming started more than 12,000 years ago. The climate is always changing. Carbon dioxide has little to no impact on climate on this planet. 2. There is no vaccine against covid. So much so that they had to change the definition of the word vaccine. It used to mean that  vaccine offered you complete immunity. Now, they say it makes the symptoms less deadly.
the difference between biological and nuclear weapons is that bio weapons cannot be controlled. unless you are in an evil cult with a bunker available to hide in, you have no way of preventing your own weapon to spread to your population and kill your own. any bio weapon maker is conscious that they are crafting their own demise. while conventional/nuclear weapons do not have that. you place them where you want them to be, run away, and press the red button. they are much more safe to use and thus more dangerous in the hands of the ill intended. this is why you can get genetic lab equip on internet, but not yellowcake.
I hope we get anthro one day...
Fun fact : Japan tried to implemt biological  warfare in ww2 but they brushed of the idea thinking that this country with ww1 weapons can 1 shot the us without any " advanced weapons "💀
Aaaaaaah bio-warfare
And here we go again. Kurzgesagt making absolutely magnificent merch and my money ofc wanting to be spent on that. I love you guy's work! Much love from Brazil ❤🇧🇷
Well, we all have seen how a bio wepon killed millions of people in three years.
Crazy?
Micheal Crichton warned in two of his book about the power of unhinged bioengineering
I'm studying Biotechnology and this was an amazing watch!
I love Kurzgesagt's videos, but I'm increasingly weirded out by the channel's new clickbaity thumbnails. If you consistently post videos wuth clickbaity titles to your viewrship base just degrades your appearance, because it makes you look like you're desperate for your attention. Edit: I just saw the video, and the topic that they're talking definetly deserves more public attention, I stand corrected.

3:47 I see what you did there. Talk about a biohazard, and quite the evil residing there.
The most dangerous weapon are the psychopatics in power.
I love this channel, but you gotta get this EA crap outta here. Materialist analyses aren't new and EA is a death cult that lets people with more money that god pretend it's okay for them to be selfish. Not stopping my sub, but I continue to be disappointed in the pushing of this garbage immediately adjacent to otherwise good information.
I think the amount was 9 billion
1 comment bet
We can techniacly force plants to be efficent because of a virus or something
Looks like it's a countdown to see whether AI or Biotechnology kills us all first.
Imagine a tiktoker in 2050  buying some lab equipment under 50 bucks and create the most dangerous virus and then releasing it into the world for cloud.
3:34 😂😂😂 it definitely leaked from a lab, they just covering it up like they always do because they can't admit when they fuck up and fork up their money as a result. There is even a chance it was released on purpose to experiment it on everyone in a sneaky way
The most dangerous weapon is a frying pan.

I hope UV lamps don't become common in public areas like this! Skin cancer is bad enough as it is, we don't need machines everywhere spewing out dangerous UV radiation making things worse.
Ach ich freue mich schon wen dieses Video 2100 auch auf dem Deutschen Kanal landet 🥲.
Ferb, I know what we’re gonna do today
The most dangerous weapon is "I love you, as a friend"
I’ve always enjoyed these videos but as this is the field I work in, I can see the slight exaggeration quite clearly. It makes a compelling video though! It does make me wonder about other videos in fields I’m not familiar with.
We most likely have a zombie bio weapon already
A very informative video.
scientists are the Helper T cells and the KIller T cells of humanity.  store all info on viruses to help and kill them.
Hey I miss the intro? Why you didn’t put it? :(
We realise that somebody is gonna try and recreate the Inferno movie.
i think more dangerous and life altering then viruses is the prospect of endless life. it sounds good but what happens when everyone is imortal. i think at one point we woulnd not be able to have kids wiht out artificial help becouse we will no longer have a need for new humans or atleast not at a constant rate anymoe
4:45 kurzgesagt has a swear word in a video??
hmmm
The most dangerous weapon is TikTok.
I believe we're wise enough to one day become star farers and build our own utopia. Weaponry (regardless of destruction potential) are just a drop in the challenge bucket we will overcome to get there.
As a right-brain guy, i like how the video visualization and it always caught my attention and never made me bore
Why is the umberella symbol is the same as ukraine defense twiters symbol😅. Intresting.....

Thanks to bill gates bro
Love the video, keep it up and i will wait for the new merch ❤
Wash y'all hands
Thank you love the work
You would have to be insanely dumb or dumbly insane to push a human killing virus deliberately into the ecosystem. Even if you developed a vaccine, humans have always been and will always be strongest in large numbers. That person across the world you killed with your virus might have been the guy supporting that open source software that you and millions of people rely upon for example.

hi
This is what government watchlists are for, not people who included “terror” in their search terms.

"the vegetables you eat your dog 😂😂😂"
At The books at 4:44 is it just me what it said on the bottom of the book on the top?
The most dangerous weapon to humanity is unaccountable groups with access to billions of dollars being pumped into biotechnology with zero to no oversight.  Kind of like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and their links to the Wuhan research institute the Coronavirus originated from  Wait, that's who gives you guys money, isn't it?
Your all wrong the most dangerous weapon is tiktok
Am I only one who blanked out when intro played or did intro actually not exist in this vid? 🤨
Huh. My first time being decently early.
This illegal to be early
that's too cool
By far, one of the best channels. You give all the science in bite sized pieces tjat anyone can understand. I wish this is what school taught like
Lets just hope in the near future this video does not age well...
Horrifying
Bro only 25 minutes ago and 74k views already ❤
It's pretty misleading to describe the lab leak "theory" as a "topic of continued scientific debate" when the only people having the "debate" are right-wing cranks and centrist pundits going "see? Both sides are bad". The lab leak theory fits all the hallmarks of a classic conspiracy theory. The evidence is entirely circumstantial, and its proponents defend it by saying they're "just asking questions". Pretty irresponsible framing from this video.
The most dangerous weapon is assuming someones gender. A ww3 is coming after that, then even undersized humans with just extra leg in the middle can decide their gender, not their parents after being born.
Yes...if you are not a victim
You mean months before...
Surprising that this wasn’t funded by Gates.
80% of humanity lives uncontrolled, chaotic states that don't even know where their citizens live. No one is going to detect it stop anything in these states.
The mutation of dogs makes me sad. They're mans best friend and people inbred them into a barely functioning creature and say "Aww it's cute!" No it isn't. It's horrible.  EDIT: Also mad respect to the Kurzesagt team in general. You guys are so open and honest about things. It's very refreshing and humbling
Yesss restrict access to knowledge. :* Burn more books!
I'm early!!!!
That’s a lot of comments in 24 minutes.
What happened to the intro?
Yeah, it's Brahmastra
It’s terrifying how easily anyone could actually create a zombie virus after enough experimentation
Remember guys the US didn’t fund gain of function research in a lab in Wuhan that tested Bat Coronaviruses, the same city where COVID-19 originated. It’s extremely racist to even suggest or consider that COVID-19 originated from a lab of whose scientists were some of the first cases. It’s much less racist( and let’s all the powerful and rich that could have caused the pandemic off the hook) to suggest that a Chinese man chose to make some Bat or Pangolin soup.
This video was weird and disjointed.

we all know it was china quit censoring yourself
oh wow
It's good or bad depending on the hand of the person who uses it. Having said that, as a biologist, I love when we truly realise the potential of biological research. It's empowering.
What?!? Were is my intro :P
CRISPRR gonna make us Crispy yall!
Genetically modifying things is concerning because it could turn those Alien movies into reality . . .
This is obvious propaganda disguised as an inocuous infotainment video.
the most dangerous weapon ofc is the grimace shake
Honestly I think people these days are more interested in wasting time in mindless activities rather than creating homemade viruses
Bio Teck The Virus That Will Kill A Civilization After We All Die
So the most dangerous weapon is an Angel from Neon Genesis Evangelion?
kerja bagus 🇮🇩
I always knew Kurzgesagt was family friendly but they snuck in bats**t on the book at 4:45 😂
Shaggy: “Like, Zoinks. I’m only using 2% of my power!”
HOW DID MY AD KNEW WHAT I WAS WATCHING!!!
Imagine humanity being wiped out by a highschool biology homework assignment 🤣
Here before this biotechnological bomb of a video blows up 😀
3:33 - No. There is no debate.
Project Blue could never get out of the lab and even if it does it definitely didn’t
The most dangerous weapon in this world is my mom's flying slippers 🥲
4:46 “New BATSHIT virus discovered” WHAAAAAAAAT
I like it
Seen the resi evil ☔ Easter egg
So everybody is just going to play Plague Inc. IRL version in like a decade? Well...
Bro literally just described what happened in the Wuhan lab
Great
Now virus.exe can infect robots and humans :)
7:26
We are either the brightest or the dumbest species to ever exist. Either improving or destroying ourselves. There is no in-between, but luckily evolution can only go up, right?
I've just noticed kurzgesagt has made 1 video every week this month, which is like super fast considering it takes usally 1-2 months, keep up the good work!
If any one is saying nuclear is not the most dangerous weapon just ahhh 😂😂😂 stop cap nuke
Great job Kurzgesagt animators!
The most dangerous weapon is cancel culture
Ivebeen saying this for years!!!
Erly
Is it just me or I think they have forgotten to add the intro.
They really made a sequel to the black plague…
Hubris to think we can control nature.
What happened to the intro?
Approaching the problem with "let's limit the knowledge" is in comparison the same as "place speed bumps and radars instead of improving infrastructure". Sure... It's cheaper in the short run and... That's about it... The primary goal should be to improve quality of life and knowledge possession/access for all while the "let's track" part should be the second pillar and "let's limit the knowledge" something that should never be mentioned again outside imprisonment facilities. "let's limit the knowledge" part only increases the amount of blind faiths and twisted ideas around the world which is the exact thing that's giving the "bad guys" the capabilities of developing nuclear/chemical/biological weapons in the first place.
18min gang
Superb video 🎉
❤️❌🤖
I feel like the comment at the beginning about how quickly COVID was analyzed and a vaccine found is a little disingenuous given that it built off existing research into SARS from several years prior. Had the SARS epidemic not happened, COVID would have taken many months, maybe even years more to get under control.
The thing that concerns me is why scientists would publish the genetics of dangerous viruses online in the first place...
If this comment blows up I will jump from the window
Keep using this "shared freely" pretty loosely, maybe we need a video on publishing in science
Always remember this video probably would have been banned during pandemic.
Maybe the cause of Human's extinction will be the friends we made along the way
Yay, i watch the video before it said "30 mins ago" 🤩
Ive heard about rumors that the coronavirus was made in a lab in China, and was accidently released
Phrase of the video: "The next step is detecting the danger by becoming aware which viruses are present among usඞ"   First time commenting on a video btw if anyone from the kurzgesagt teams sees this, thank you so much for what you are doing. Please never stop what you guys are doing and turn your achievements into forever lasting legacies!
There's often a lot of chat of doom and gloom, but it's encouraging to be reminded of the innovation potential of humanity which is often overlooked.  Thanks, Kurzgesagt.
Another way to end our world. Yay.
Any non-zero chance, if given unli time, will happen eventually.
We should also sanction countries for catching bats 😏
If you aren't subscribed to Kurzgesagt WHAT ARE YOU DOING
Way to give everyone a terrible idea 😂
If only I had enough money to buy a new car What a great advertising!  ***  "undoing centuries of progress" - that's like the most of progress we had  okey-dokey - back to monke we go then
Does anyone still believe it came from bats?
Come on, are you scientists or not? Pretty clear by now cv didn't come from nature.
3:45 "thats still subject to scientific debate"...  I think here you should acknowledge the fact that for over 2 years it absolutely was not "up for scientific debate".  So it would be more accurate to say "after people refusing to put up with fascistic authoritarian censorship, is now finally up for scientific debate".
kurzgesagt says eat ze bugs and inject ze vaccines
So biohazard was right!
Where are the faces 9f the humans?
The umbrella corp. Building reference gave me chills... 👀💀
I remember watching your videos when I was just 6-7 years old. It was like magic for me, still is. Thank you so much for bringing science into my life.
Umbrella corporation wants to know your locations.

Dr Bombastic "side eye"
Another amazing video
You can tell they've taken a bit of time to make this vid. Since then, they've confirmed coronavirus was made in a China lab, then leaked bc someone got infected. And the vaccine is a pitiful attempt to make something effective in such a quick time.
🎯💯  ☮️💙💛❤️☮️
Yoo bro the art is so good!
Is smoking weed bad for u Kurzgesagt? Thnx!
The most dangerous weapon is we all humans that are harming the entire universe 🌌🌌
Present among us
Kurzgesagt doesn’t disappoint!
You speak of the vaccine like it was a good thing? Who’s side are you on buddy?hmm hmm
Mr bombastics bomb building ☠️☠️☠️
3:18 If I could make a nuclear bomb in my backyard, i would propably be on a FBI high wanted list, snice owning nuclear materials needed for such a bomb is ilegal.

Who thinks this is the best channel on YT? 👇
So similar to the AI doomsday talk, also very similar to the AI deepfake talk, and also similar to the Nuclear bomb doomsday talk. Also remember the doomsday around a decade ago people talking about meteor is coming and the world ended. And finally, the gun regulation, mass shooting doomsday talk. I agree a lot of people will die in the process, but it feels like it is inevitable, as there will be more and more different ways human will kill other humans. But at the same time, we as a species always survive. I think there is the saving grace.
Humans are weird creatures. We're the only species that are stupid enough to invent things to kill ourselves.

the most dangerous weapon on earth is the internet

Youtube is confused It shows 1 comment
oooh you're preparing us thank you
I'm 13 minutes after this video got uploaded
Are we still pretending the lab vs wet market question is still a mystery?  I mean I get momma Susan won't let us just say it but how long until we can say it?
let's just hope that an Umbrella Corporation is never real
I don’t think we can stop people from ordering dangerous dna online or stop them from making one in their lab. Anyone with such intention can make it encrypted or get the sequence cooked easily with the right machines, and they are not that hard to get.
The most dangerous weapon is Kurzgesagt's arsenal used on the birds.
The only weapon more is the earth energy core self-destruct button costing 99999999999999 robux
nothing beats the belt
3:16 You pretty much can. People pretty much have. The CIA ran a test back in i think the 60's? They gave two math graduates an infinite amount of resources, and said "figure it out." With no help, no information, just themselves. They did it in like a few months.
Thank you kurzgesagt!
i love how we spend so much time and money finding better and better ways to kill each other
Why use rockets when you can use a Needle or a cough 😷
Analogy to hacking is more appropriate than atomic bombs. 1. Biology is widespread and can not be regulated at the resource level like radioactive materials. 2. Many of the tools used for bio-hacking are small yet powerful, whereas nuclear require economies of scale.
Thank you ❤
CoVid came from a lab. This has been determined.
100th? the video was released 3 minutes ago, don't think more people would have commented.
I know what we’re gonna do today Ferb!
It never was, weponized antimatter anyone?
Jeez, this video is bad. First of all, it is not that easy. Biology did not become simpler. You are not assembling iphones in schools. You were given a most repetitive work to do which is easy for anyone to accomplish while experts put it all together. It is equivalent of you working in a factory, sorting goods and then pretending that you made them.  Furthermore, from where you get this "order viruses online" and "get professional lab equipment". They are not ordered online. You have to have your own firm, contact sales representative. Genetic material most likely is only sent if you are registered and licensed.   The worst of it is that half way through the video, I still saw no substance. It is just fear mongering and talking about something which author seems to have no idea about.
Deadly bio tech labs found in Sudan and it is funded by WHO, Bill Gates, Fauci. And what about mRNA vaccine? Are the really doing their job or something else(interacting with human reproductive system etc.)? Very fishy. Something isn't right XD

It fills my heart with pride on how far we've come as a species- and how despite our shortcomings we *are* still trying our best to do more good than bad. I have immense respect for all scientists, doctors, researchers, inventors, and philosophers. As well as the laborers that make the thinker's ideas realized. I wish more folks would see the good in humanity rather than the constant dismissive statements such as "I hate people". That kind of negativity is not helpful at all. To anybody.
Яким чином вовки перетворилися на мопсів?
4:45 New batshit virus?
Mr bombastic?
The most dangerous thing is human desire.. which may end humanity...
Nuclear is still the king of destruction. The radiation lasts hundreds of years. A pandemic only lasts few years
Nice video as always! By this time, would be great to talk about quantum computers, A.I. and its exponential growth and consequences for the next years.
6:48 Is this a reference to resident evil?
Infosec already has mature procedures to handle infohazards, we don't need this dictatorial attitude. What we need is generous funding to ensure that talented experts aren't rejected, and bounties to ensure that any benefit from publicly sharing infoweapons is much less than the reward for going through the proper pathways.
10mins ago let’s gooo❤❤🎉🎉
You are Amazing !👊🏽❤️
18 minutes late
Considering how the CoV-19 pandemic was handled, there appears to be quite some cause for concern. Considering that building a nuclear bomb at home is much more noticeable than bioengineering, I'd say that isn't really a fair analogy.
its a great thing but can be used to do bad
Kurzgesagt has uploaded!
Your posters are looking great, but are to small. double the size, pls.
Hi
The top tool for wiping morality and humanity out is authoritarianism🔨🔧🔩
The animation quality improved! Keep the good work up Kurzgesagt!
Well... The covid vaccine, as we see e.g. in Sweden, did very little to change the overall numbers...
Another amazing video as always. Thank you!
Ur so aswoeme
It is incredible how in the advancement of biotechnology they are worrying about its access to anyone, meanwhile in artificial intelligence there are even millions who say that there is no need to Worry
Kurzgesagt Is Definitely On A Watch List By Saying Everything
Good video keep it up!  Also lets just talk about how the last book is called 4:46
roses are red faster then a cheetah wait i cant finish this rhyme uhhhhhhhhh
Loved the burger
You have to make that dog so hideous?
epic
i feel like lately kurzgesagt videos are getting repetitive. Like they did so many things like ant colony and evolution, now its just space or something related to micro-organisms inside us.
The Unbrella corp reference at 6:48 was perfect lol
The most dangerous weapon is deez.
Lol i paused and resumed at just the right moment to hear "eat your dog."   Oh know @kurzgesagt i would never 😂
The weapon was the friends we made all along.
hi kurzis ghast
I saw the Data Time ad before this video, Did you?
man i LOVE how you guys are making so many videos its amazing
I’ve finally realised - Kurzgesagt means ‘you won’t be sleeping tonight’
The most dangerous weapon is social networks.
Your posters are all incredible, the quality of the art is amazing and I’m definitely gonna buy a few of them, they are easily worth the money.
ahh yes, all of those sci-fi movies were right
3:32 I remember back when you couldn't even remotely suggest the idea of a COVID-19 lab leak without getting censored or banned. Funny how that all just gets swept under the rug.
Hello
I really reapect how you handle mistakes. No one can always get it right, and kurzgezagt sets a great example for how to communicate with transparency and humility.... And how to turn a mistake into a big win for everyone!
9:16 “A few years ago we posted an image of a fake evolutionary tree on social media.”  Shame! From an educational channel no less. You guys should have known better, lying about it is wrong, especially when so many people deny evolution.  Kudos for admitting your mistake and correcting it.
According to me the universe 🌌🌌 is just a ball 🔮 if we move faster than the light we will go in past and if not faster than the light's speed then it will take billions of years for us to go the end of this universe but till the time we die that's why we can't escape from this ball 🔮🔮🔮🔮
The most dangerous weapon in the world is anyone who has eaten Taco Bell in the last 48 hours. Cause they're nuclear explosions are gonna be so goddamn powerful and radioactive.
I really thought I'd see a cat girl reference..in this video 😂
Warning: this comment contains my crappy opinion on a matter I don't under stand well. Proceed with caution and grains of salt.      Or we could turn ourselves into robots by inventing the artificial conciousness and counting people, not humans specifically, as 'alive', or rather concious. That way we, as non-humans, would be immune the biological hazards by becoming something void of biology. Of course, there would be a lot of other and different, maybe even worse problems, if we were to stop being human, but I'm merely speculating here.
Helloooo
Thank you for sharing that making a virus on my backyard us doable
Why don't these scientists create the vaccines/antivirus medicines first before sharing the info with the whole world instead? If you can't find the cure yet, then don't spread it or even better kill it first before anything bad happens
And people still think covid was a natural disaster.
i cant wait to eat lab-grown bananas
Loved the Umbrella and Jurassic Park references in there 😂
The most dangerous weapon is my bad breath
Can you actually download and *3D-print a virus* from internet already? 🤔
big farma propaganda. bull *hit.
This video is just going to become fodder for conspiracy theories next time we have a pandemic
You guys are my main source of scienctific information
claim your before 1 hour ticket here.
The most dangerous weapon in this society is the coronavirus, which had infected people amongus, hence their spacesuits. Credit to another comment for this joke
this clip is sooo good. Thank you
Difference between biotechnology and microbiology?
when a video is not funded by a multi-billionaire it feels better, just kurzgesagt, not easy propaganda for wealthy.
Always happy to see a video from you guys, keep up the great work.
Ah sweet, manmade horrors beyond my comprehension
The most dangerous weapon is....us😞
I'm kind of uncomfortable with some of the stuff in the delay step. I fear limiting access to certain biotechnology could slow down research and it kind of clashes with some of my free information ideals. Not really sure how to solve this in a way I'm comfortable with.
I miss the birds a lot!!!!!!!
This vid would have gotten you banned 2 or 3 years ago. You tread a little too lighrly on covid imo
I’m mostly scared of a bioweapon that gets created to target specific demographics. For example, a virus that targets a certain ethnicity. It is considered theoretically possible.
all this progress yet i don't see scientists crying on the internet about their job being taken over by technology unlike artists the past few months. artists are truly some of the most spoiled, bratty & entitled human beings on the planet
truly a birbin moment
Imagine...
Early to a video 🎉
7:26 among us
wow nice another fine addition to my collection of existential dreads  thank you kurzgesagt!
Climate change is a hoax
Yeah, we’re screwed, all it takes is one disaffected incel to decide to engineer some super virus in order to get “revenge” on women, and it’s over.
oof that got very existential half way through, but the ending tied it together super well
3:32 We DO know. We have Fauci’s emails wherein his admission lies.
Human really craft bioweapon to rid their own kind, what a world
woah fast uploads
I always wonder if it's a good idea to inform the public on how people with bad intention can deal the most dommage, as it might give those uninformed a bad idea, on the other side, it helps the public be aware of the danger and how to react
Reminds me of that one will smith movie about a virus
Bio weapons are a whole other class of evil  Look at resident evil especially
Great video as always❤
Where are the Birds😡, Why did you Fired them
Have you considered antimatter bombs? A person's weight of antimatter can oblitirate like ALL the nukes on our planet combined
I have repalyed the part where he says among us like 3 times already what is wrong with me
Kurzgesagt was quality over quantity and now they are quality AND quantity.
OK.. i guess i could make a deadly virus in my room , but not because you said so (jk jk)
"New batshit virus discovered" 😂
In the end, information is the most powerful weapon
The 40k universe is getting exponentially closer every day...
Hi
I saw that you reuse the scene from the lyssavirus I didn't think it's fits in here you just make a new one but it's just a suggestion you don't actually have to ;)
mum Kurzgesagt just posted a new video!!
Early birds will know that this video was originally titled "The Most Dangerous Weapon is NOT Nuclear"
That's why most apocalypse science fiction is about zombies, not aliens.
3:37 As a Chinese, just as I guessed, the translated version would not appear within the GFW. Could you add an official Chinese subtitle?
I love this Channel so much
hi I just wiped my ass
Wait... the umbrella corporation? nerds xD
7:26
BRUH!
If there's a biological war, I'll go into a submarine. Surely nothing could happen to me then
So, we are our own most dangerous weapon. That is sad.
Amazing video man. Well done!
A couple points, most independent governing bodies that have performed an investigation believe lab leak is the most likely cause, you did not bring up the fact that covid was born of gain of function research or mention the specific dangers of that, lastly a lot of nuclear material is unaccounted for, and is found by random people surprisingly often
how do you make vids so fast?
Chinese labs- "write that down! Write that down!"
were f***ed there's no way that this is stuff is going to stop the new malicious minds on earth
lets forget all the morals and valiues and just tinker away at dna and radiate evrything to mutate it ... that does sound wrong
Hi! Also keep up the good work! :)
So can you do a tutorial on how to perhaps make a deadly virus that is able to take 1,185,000 people? (Asking for a friend, he needs it for school)
7:26 are present AMONG US
The top comment will probably say amongus because the channel has been embracing the memes and honestly I don't blame them 💀
12 min agoooo
Ahh humans always finding better more creative ways to kill each other
Ah, time for the periodic dose of existential crisis.
Is it just me or they forgot to add the intro?
Best channel on YouTube
Doesn't necessarily require a scientist to determine whether covid19 leaked by a lab or not. Just a good journalist and open health records
"New batshit virus discovered" 💀💀
6:18 how oppenheimer movie was shooted
Would be great if they made a virus that makes all beings steril. Don't cope
the legend sais that kurzgasagt are not going to like my comment:O(nice vidio btw  <3
Its league of legends
Both interesting and terrifying truly a kurzgesagt video
The Kurzgesagt officially said "Among us"
Man I can’t wait for biotech to get so accessible and advanced that I can make advanced gene mods that can do things like Change physical aspects of my body and make them in a backyard laboratory.
Hopefully they find a cure for Helmsmortel Vander DaA syndrome
why is mr bombastic from the meme here 💀
3 vids so quickly :O
If thought Imperium is going to make a vegetable fish someone could totally make a virus that ends the world 🌎 :)
Then china’s weapon backfired on them
You don't gain something without losing something of equal value.
Hello there
Covid-19 pandemic has turned to endemic. Kurzgesagt:  Weaponized deadly virus more dangerous than nuclear bomb!
I'm already poor, i Will not have such fear... I Will die before for mamy other cause.
Hmm
This went well when China told the WHO that COVID-19 wasn’t transmissible, and then the WHO released this info as a fact.
Islamic fanatics will definitely use a biological terrorist attack in their next uprising.
Something tells me that the grimace shake has something to do with this video
WHERE ARE THE DUCKS KURTGEZAGT?! WHERE ARE THEY!?!
Ive definitely had this thought before. The plot of presentable liberty comes to mind. Very scary possibilities if not handled with care.
These animations are incredible!
Wow. Great video
Nothing
Thats a lot of cgi. ^^
We all gonna die soon if theres a war using it
An EMP is right up there
I'll add this to my list of daily things to worry about
kurmzsgesagtm
Insane vids like always👍
did you use AI voice gen at 6th minute? or is it just some sound artifact?
I always thought CRISPR-Cas9 making biotech relatively easily and cheaply accessible plus an increasing amount of people that vehemently believe there should be less humans was always kind of a bad situation waiting to happen eventually.
Hello
32000 views in 12 minutes. Wow! Good job
I’m scared now:(
well that was interesting i wonder when this will become a stronger presences in our lives
I want to click every video whenever I see something huge
WOW
Yes, this is a terrifying possibility and one I hope we never have to deal with. But the morbid curiosity in me kind of wants to see what a bioengineering apocalypse would be like. Like I’d love to read a story set on such a world just to see where it goes
I always fear biological engineering more than chemical engineering.  Due to biology being unpredictable. Chemistry is the foundation of Biology. Chemicals cannot evolve though can be made potent however only with human intervention. And these threats are much more easier to solve then biology.  While biological pathogen can be potent without human intervention once the foundation are in place. They keep evolving unlike chemicals once you found the antidote that works. It will work indefinitely forever. As long there is not changes on the molecular structure. While biology, you got a short window of time before your cure is less effective and a new cure is needed.  However all these are scary but exciting.
HELLO 👋😜😝🙃
Always love having an existential crisis and then suddenly get very determined for no reason! ❤
E
no way,live action plague inc
why didnt the intro play
Bio weapons are worse indeed. nuke? nah the life will restore  virus can be made to attack everything and kill them easily
Guess Farting virus would be the most insane thing that could kill me

Excellent idea Kurzgesagt, thankyou very much.
its always a good day when kurzgesagt uploads a new video
THE CCP CREATED SarsCov2 ON PURPOSE. Well meaning? Your narrative collapses under independent scrutiny.
Kurzgesagt I wish you create a video on great apes and our evolutionary ancestors I like your early videos that touch those subjects
WHITE PHOSPHORUS BOMBSSS
wow i sure hope this never happens
Takes 2 weeks. Awesome
Great video. Scary stuff.
Among us
Let's move ahead with kurz ke sath the most popular channel best channel for learning new things 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
the possibilities of bio engineering recently begin to remind me of a game ive played, called rain world, since in the lore, there is some stuff about bio engineered creatures.
no intro ???
You CAN build a nuke in your backyard, a child could actually do it. The issue is getting your hands on radioactive material and that is for this very reason. Radioactivity is very simple but also very powerful and that is the biggest issue about it, it is like giving big rifles to monkeys. Given the material, anyone who attended school in germany and had physics /chemistry has the theoretical knowledge to do it.
The bat was scarier than my worst nightmare 😭
Kurzgesagt should stop, they are giving ideas to the government at an alarming pace.
i love kurzgasagts uploads
plague inc players, *assemble*
Nice
Yah the vaccine ready for testing months after is pretty sus.
10 minutes ago yay
This video gives plague Inc cure mode vibes
Early
Don't be afraid to dream big and set audacious goals. With determination and hard work, you can turn those dreams into reality. Believe in yourself and go after what you want!
Lol
Steve
Y virus mean?
Funny how it says only one comment, and when I click on the comments, I see many, many, many comments.
The Umbrella Corporation sign was a nice touch 😂❤ RE is an awesome game franchise.
.... as the biotech bubble is collapsing all around us right now
7:26 among us
It feels like the bioscience industry is overdue for a meaningful, evidence-based re-evaluation of the risk-to-benefit ratio on pushing so hard and so far for research on virus creation and discovery. It really seems that the risks have been massively undervalued in the past.  P.S. Also, if the only tangible benefits are "we can counter the risks our action causes" i.e. if the only benefit is mopping up after their own spills, then the actual value of said benefits also needs to be reassessed. In other words, we know we can, we don't know if we should, and assuming that we should-by-default is foolish.
Love your videos! Thank you for making such great pieces of art and information
Im quite early great video btw
3:50 Oh no, who gave a virus sample to the Umbrella Corporation?!
Among us
5:01 They share their engineered, highly virulent virus in books, and research papers, while the news about UFO encounter are silenced, huh, what is going on with the government now?
It's amazing to see how much your animation quality has evolved over the years. Keep up the good work!
yay!
not ai?
I wish people who design biological weapons be the first victims.
I admire the lack of shame in saying coronavirus
Resident Evil is becoming reality
One can only wonder why the 'virus making kits' , so to speak, are not tracked.
Covid was bad enough  If some rando can just buy a virus and spread it easily we’re 100% screwed
We need more ducks!!!
4:45 “New Batshit virus discovered” I see what you did there.
!!PLAGUE INC. MULTIPLAYER!!
The most dangerous weapon in the world is music. Have you ever seen a person die because of it? Exactly, it isn't just deadly, it's covert.
ahh yes weaponised corona, i can feel it coming.
"vaccine"
cool and scary at the same time
What if we could make a Nuke in our backyard?  Make A weapon to surpass metal gear of course
Ive been inspired soo much by u even tho im 10 years old ive learned soo much thank you😊
Covid 19 has taught me there are more dangerous weapons than nuclear weapons
Wheres the intro 😢
how comments so fast??
Vsouce
This channel might become the next youtube core
Imagine if some guy unleashed a deadly virus just cause his girl broke up with him...
.
Cool!
Steve Taylor is a light puncturing the dark
i am become the viewer,kurzgesagt watcher
Great quality as usual! Do you know if there are certain cells that are more prone to becoming cancerous than others? Thanks!
Interesting!!!🌟🌟💯💯
The beauty of freely available information, and the deadly potential consequences.
Man, imagine something like airborne rabies.
3:33 I know it's the safe thing to say that we still don't know if it came from a lab or nature, but even our intelligence agencies are now admitting that it probably came from the lab.
so what i’m seeing here is that we’re closer than ever to making jurassic park in real life
That much of a comment just in 6 mins
Was I the only one that got banged by an ad with a man promoting his YT that knew I was watching kurzgesagt?
The necular episodes are the best❤️
6min mark 🫡
The most dangerous weapon is hillary clinton
YESSSS
Politicans?
Grimace Shake it is
Just the idea of a plague Inc in real life is terrifying. If a terrorist was able to do that... it would be catastrophic.
Hi
15k views
Most people in the comment section still haven't finished the video in 2x speed as of right now
I don't know why, but I feel like the animation in this video some how is of poor or different quality than the other videos
No intro this time? Did you guys forget or you don't do them anymore?.
Best channel in yt
The sheer helplessness of a bio-weapon is terrifying.   We've used Physics as a weapon, and biology will pose an equal threat on our world.
If they’re going to make a bioweapon to kill us all, at least make it a zombie virus or something, It’d be a fun way to test all the zombie survival theories we made when the world was obsessed with the walking dead
0:33 That pug's eyes are actually really unnerving.
Rehehehehe
Yeah, a new video to get even more existential crisis!
At the end of the day, the greatest weapon of them all is human enginuity.
1:20  700 dollar+ phones ain't cheap .
Whether its Biological, Mechanical or Nuclear, if Humanity is to be undone it will be by its own hubris.
I use my bio-nuclears too watch birds.
Ahh, more gates shilling. Gotcha.
WHERE ARE THE BIRDS I LOVE THE BIRDS
Youtube drunk again, 1 comment
Covid was manmade
Guess I gotta get my bio grades up
I ssear, the most terrifying thing that could happen is if some country bio-engineered a strain of the rabies vius to be even more lethal and spread more quickly from person to person. Normal rabies is scary enough as is, but a super-rabies strain could literally cause a zombie apocalypse.
Yo early gang
Love and respect from Pakistan 🇵🇰
Covid was made in a lab and was humanity’s fault
Two week record! Or best, new schedule?
The future seems dark, People who watch Kurzgesagt may save it…
The most dangerous thing is actually no eye syndrome
2:42 your Iphone part is not genuine -- Face ID disabled...
Wow, this video was very informative
This video was uploaded 2 minutes ago, but people(or bots) have trashed the comments already.   People should be a far worse weapon compared to tech, weapons, or politicians.
But it can't defeat the power of friendship

Biotechnology?  But what about Artificial Intelligences, do you think that is more dangerous than Nuclear too?
So we could make a virus that turns people into a zombie

hiii
New fear unlock
It's always a good day when kurzgesagt has a new video
Russia will use these in ukraine...i can feel it coming.
Thanks for explaining why things like covid being created in labs is so dangerous.
Viruses do not taste nice, I warn you all now!
10k views in few minutes
I never had covid
Love your content! Keep up the great work! ❤
I just woke up.
I know this video is about the pace of bio technology but I think we can all agree the covid vaccine has been a flop to say the least
The most dangerous weapon is one that kills populations without them realizing it. Such as poverty and lack of medical or educations
My sister got infected with COVID, she is still unable to go to school, 1 1/2 years later. If this virus was engineered, then this proves how deadly unregulated bio-research is.
EEEK. What i couldn't love more is Kurzgesagt, Open Philanthropy and 80 000 hours collaboratiing ♥️
.... wasn't that virus created in a lab? Lol awe man..
didnt realize, 1 minute ago holy hell
🧢
You know bio weapons are bad when even countries who are at war agree to nit use them on each other!
Always creating beautiful animation🔥🔥
I have never been this early.
It's incredible what biotechnology has come to, truly fascinating.
So much content lately!
My ex-girlfriend's heart is actually the most dangerous weapon.  Oh wait, she never had a heart to begin with!
Always impressed with your hard work and honesty :) I always look forward to your videos
The most dangerous weapon is whatever my mum picks up to throw at me when i misbehave
Excellent work as always. Very informative, excellent and excitibg visuals.
Among us
China
i see the upload was 2 minutes ago and the video is 11 mins and there are comments already without seeing it . huh ........
Another video? The gods have blessed us!
Nobody has finished the video yet
3 mins after release?!?
Men
They're posting more frequently now. I'm glad to see that
I Wonder what kind of crazy virus or bacterias are made in labs.
Chat is this real?
P
Lol unkown corona virus, Im sure the Chinese government has NO IDEA where it came from.
Woah
The most dangerous weapon is us
i love how there are comments saying great video even though it's been 2 minutes since they uploaded an 11 minute video
Can’t the nuclear bombs just.. literally split the bio stuff atom by atom? Of course, biotech is far more widespread, but nuclear bombs are a 100% death rate.
Cool
It’s coming from an Austrian painter

Love these videos, been watching them since 7th grade . (I'll never stop)
I'm swimming in this deep ocean, as if i suddenly immersed myself in the worlds of effective altruism, open philanthropy, kurzgesagt and more
It is funny that within a minute since upload, people who comment here act like they have already watched the whole video from the future😂😂😂
Hi
This videos sponsored by the government just remember that
Motivation at work ❤
Your animations are becoming better and better every video, bravo Kurzgesagt team 👏
The book "The Truth about Wuhan: How I Uncovered the Biggest Lie in History" is a highly recommended read
You have thought me so many things and I love this channel. Thank you.
Nuclear
As usual, another common beautiful upload from Kurzgesagt teaching me things I didn't want to know, but I now do
As an Australian, I must say that  I appreciate that this video was uploaded so early
