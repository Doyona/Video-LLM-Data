So, after publishing this video, I realized that good friend @Techmeout was the first out with a Gold iPhone 12 Pro video.  Linking her video video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqhMZ6WSR2c&t=40s

Im loving my pacific blue i dont like hot the gold look
Your sound like those people that talk in the news
Gold is Classy.. got the Silver it is Gorgeous 😘
Honestly I find the 12 pro max's gold classier than the 11 pro max's I dunno why, but it's like they took the silver colour and mixed it up with the 11 pro max's gold, and you get the gold of the 12 pro max, and I like it!😁
Best Iphone 12 Pro review vid!
Hi, what is the face of the Apple Watch at 8:28?  I have series 5 aluminum.
I am getting the new iPhone 12 Pro (although I am kinda late to the party) and I have been having issues picking out which color I am going to buy. Thank you so much for this review because now I know exactly which color phone I am going to choose when I get it
Hoping to get the iphone 12 pro today
Cyberadress is fake in insta beware guys
Their so cool but I rather stay with my iPhone XS Max
Matthew 1:21 "He will save His people from their sins"❤️
is this a Wok channel? thought so.
I got the iPhone 12 Pro Max in silver in 256gb and I absolutely love it!!! It’s the best iPhone ever made and it’s so beautiful in person. Only con is the fact the phone didn’t come with a wall charging block adapter and it was annoying to have to buy one more thing for the expensive device already but honestly it’s not that horrible but I didn’t realize you can use your old charger with the 12’s line but unless you have a fast charger like I have had for a while and it works great but it wasn’t a big deal. It’s a great device. Love it! Great video
is it just me, or do the pics of the arcade machines look exactly the same? o.o
Nice. I just ordered me a 12pro cant wait to receive mine
This unboxing/review is just wow 👍🏻
Can someone give me this shit 😔😔😔
Fucking he’ll , doesn’t mr myagi drove on and on
Ummm that’s not gold . It’s beige .   Or at best , Jewish racing gold
These duty is so funny
I love my iphone 12 pro 🥳
I regret getting blue but I’m still thankful
YouTuber are promoting blue but gold is killer this time .
You"re not michaeljosh you are Zhang Wang Fang lol.
oh yea...I never use my charger or headphones with the phone. so thank you apple for not including that bit I always do use my stickers...go to hell apple
useless and time consuming video
Ive just subscribed. Loved the video!
If I don’t look closer, I through it’s a sliver one instead of gold😂😂😂
Did I heard @ 7.30 that iPhone 12 from the back is glassy and the 12 pro is mat
YEET
11 pro gold is way contrast than 12 pro
what the fuck is that rave music in the background
One question, the edges are easily scratched in the gold color?
I need to fulfill my heart just by seeing these videos 😦😩
A lot of boys would like to unwrap your package 📦 💜 💜 💜
Why not just include the megsafe into the box
This isn’t really gold. Looks champagne. I would have liked it way more if it was a deeper gold. The silver looks way better because it’s off-white with silver trim.
Blue is the best
Iv had black and gold for the past 2 years and gold in general for the past 3 years. I’m getting the blue.
Is by gold does he mean rose gold??
Help! 256 GB or 512 GB? N
Bro , i really like how you do your videos , it’s entertaining 👏🏼
apple must have stolen this white with the hint of gold at its side design from kronika's suit :D
I JUST ORDERED THE 12 PRO IN GOLD NOW IM  LIKE SAD BECAUSE I DIDNT KNOW THE 12 WAS GONNA BE THE SAME- IM🗿
new quick review of iphone 12 pro gold 👉 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0HlxHTwc28
You are a real pro, Mr Josh while making review videos.
That’s not gold
Brian Tongg is that you?? 😱😱
my brother just ordered me mine! i'm getting it on the eleventh!! so excited
Already preorder iPhone 12 pro gold like 3 week ago and it should arrive sometimes this week! Man I’m so stoked!!! Can’t wait!
thank god for the tougher glasses
All we need now is for iphone to have a hidden camera. Under the screen maybe ?
Why did u have to put shit music in the background 😭
you got to be kidding.... $59 for that?? people just pay for the brand name atp... its nothing good
Loved the video 💕 I also filmed an UNBOXING VIDEO on my Channel of my New Iphone 12 pro max 🕊🕊 it is really stunning and I’ve loved using it so far!!💕💕
I’m upgrading from a iPhone 11 to an iPhone 12 pro I love that gold😍
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5g = $550  Xiaomi mi 10T 5g = $499  iPhone 12 pro max $1099
Hshsh
Should I get the pro or the pro max?
The gold looks like cheap plastic.
I’m watching this video on iPhone 7 Plus
Trying to listen to the important information, too busy dancing to the song ...smh
I wish there was a red iPhone 12 Pro.  I have the red Apple Series 6 Watch.  I thought about getting the iPhone 12 in red but I really want the Pro or Pro Max.  I always get silver, so I might go with gold this time.
Actually, both iPhones the 12 & 12 Pro can both film in 4k 60fps, just so ya’ll can know the truth about the cameras.
This is a Comment
I want the 12 pro but it’s hard picking between gold , silver or space gray
10:07 wait, how come iP12's shot is better than the Pro? 🤔
Gold ❤
I got the gold too ☺️☺️
I really love the gold one 😍😍😍😍
Is it finally gold gold or pink gold?.
Midget
WAYYYY TOO MUXH TALKING BLAH BLAH NOT WNOUGH PHONE !!!!
Apple’s Gold iPhones have been failing my expectations every time. I wish that it would lose the ‘rose’ look.
Glad I ordered iPhone 12 Pro Gold looks totally stunning and beautiful premium phone can't wait.
0 unboxing in this video
ram?
I hope someday I have an iPhone.
Am I the only one that doesn't know how to set my own videos up in chapters like this video does?
Can i use it for astrophotography?
New subscriber here. 😁
What is the cost of the plum case?
I bought the gold iPhone A couple days ago now, and I agree it isn’t as gold as I was expecting it to be. But I do really like it. I like how it’s like an off gold on the back but the sides are really gold so it gives it a great compliment to the back being light. It’s a dope phone I love it
Not the same display. One is Samsung one is Chinese
Best colors: 1. Dolomite Gold 2. Pacific Blue 3. Graphite Black 4. Silver
So gold sides with white back.. not a fan
The Gold iPhone 12 Pro looks good
Ordered gold
I watch all unboxing videos and gold one isn't so rare. If you need a USB-C charger, then consider buying Pixel. You can get Pixel 2 really cheap and a charger from it will work great.
The audacity to put only one sticker in the box 😒
I’d love gold color on iPhone.. will get this one after my gold 5S, SE, and XS..
1000 + Euros , I buy used vehicle not child phone
How much here in Philippines
i HATE THE NOTCH
Iphones by far the best design this year, unlike that phone with plastic case, ugly lego camera bump and cheap looking colors. XD . . . . . . . Smasung left the chat.
Oh $1,500 dollars phone with no charger?!   Video ranting about it! That is outrageous!  https://youtu.be/qVREl8rnHEY
Lol
Damn I didn’t even realize that first-time iPhone buyers need to go out and buy a charger cuz they don’t have a current one to use lol.
Is the gold similar to rose gold or closer to gold?
In my opinion this year's gold is the cheapest looking one, I literally compared my 11 pro gold and 12 pro gold looks really plain and no much pearl and dimension to it. Gold frame looks somehow cheap too. On the contrary I like Graphite and Blue.
Did anybody catch when he  held the end of the wallet so it would not come off
I like the gold, but the white/silver one goes with every case... mmmmmmmmmh
Very nice explanation, keep up the good work.😀😀😀🙂
I wonder how much this idiot pays to be on the top of the YouTube search list? I feel like he would be more comfortable on the bottom. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Xectechcare has done before you
music ?
Still Android Phones like Samsung and LG are way better than iPhone phones
!!!!Caution!!! Ugly Scratches!!!! i phones screens are getting ugly scratches with in hours of use. ★MKBHD at 3:21 (https://youtu.be/X1b3C2081-Q) ★Dave lee at 2:32 (https://youtu.be/ybt03airuTk) ★Pocketnow at 6:23 (https://youtu.be/FRlt83YX5yQ)  Only whatched these 3reviews of MKBHD, Pocketnow and Davelee and they all are experiencing ugly scratches. Are all other reviewers are having the same kind of ugly scratches? Tobme it in now 100% cases.
iPhone 12 looks ugly as fuck it’s like a old fashion from iPhone 5 at least iPhone 11 has better smooth edges and it has glass on the back feels great on the hand the iPhone 12 feels like a TUNA CAN on the edges and feels awful I like my iPhone 11 it’s still Sexy Purple as fuck
Don’t think the magnetic wallet is a good idea
I’m in for the 12 PRO in Gold. Thanks for the cool vid, I have now an XR in White in perfect shape but will upgrade.
Question: do you think there is a difference between buying sim free iPhone from Apple vs. an iPhone that is unlocked and sim free using the Verizon link (also from the apple store)? One reason I ask this because the apple website says all the phones are unlocked. Also, because I just want to take my current SIM card (Verizon) from my iPhone X and put it into my iPhone 12 (if I order one) without having to start a 5G plan. Which option do you think would have the easiest results?
It is easy for YouTubers to put the iPhone 12 Pro Max vs iPhone 11 Pro Max, For people like me I didn’t upgrade from a iPhone XS Max to a iPhone 11 Pro Max. Can you do a iPhone X & iPhone XS Max Vs iPhone 12 Pro Max. I would really like to know what is the benefits between the 3 phones. Or do I hang on to the iPhone XS Max
also: The iPhone 5S has a great gold color, way better than the ipHone XS Gold my wife has (more pink/gold ish).  Pretty disappointed with the gold color from this review. Hope other reviewers give us a better look at the color.
this is not a review i expected. its rather another commercial. dis
pretty bad light to see the gold one in. Im thinking of getting the gold variant but the color seems a bit dull in your light surrounding. I'd like to see it in a more dark environment.
Great review! Thank you
You are so Chinese and cute. You are adorable

Most of YouTube's very Bias when it comes on to apple, because if it was samsung leave out the charging brick everyone would bash them, but Apple do its ok no one says anything just ignore it....
Iphone plsss😣
Nice video, is the gold iPhone a lighter shade than the iPhone 11 Pro Max? When you compared it with the white model it was almost alike... maybe it wa star lightening. :)
I’m updating from my iPhone 6s+ to 12ProMax and really wish it came with AirPods and charger!? 😕
This year gold suckzz
Honestly I never thought I could ever get login password to my wife   account but thanks to *Adunlocker* on IG as he successfully got me acess to his account.

Who cares about color since we will all be using a case
a lot of new features that i dont need at all... thanks for the video
Gonna go for gold this time, but I hope there is a graphite back with gold frame combination.
Thank q
It’s my dream.
Is it a girly kind of gold or it can be a manly too? Any thoughts?
Dude has two first names. Threw me for a loop 🤣
Man I may be switching from Note 10 Plus back to Apple after seeing this. I want rhe max tho
Imagine all the E-Waste from the magsafe products ..( all those cables and discs and charging bricks required to use them ) ..🙄
Beautiful sharing excellent review 👍
Anyone waiting for iphone 13
1149SGD is the mini price.
The gold version rocks!  I'm not really attracted to the pacific blue.
I had Gold 12 PRO JUSTLOVE IT 🍏🍊
Thanks for showing the gold one!!😁
I had the 12 pro gold in my hands it was a model but it felt nice I was disappointed I couldn’t get it immediately I’ve been waiting to For the 12 since July and I wanted the pro but they didn’t have it so I ordered it online it will come through November 27 or December 18
I always look forward to your reviews. 💙 compact
Unboxing therapy has already unbox iPhone 12 Pro. The gold.  And all of the new IPhone
You have not seen gold iPhone 12 Pro? Unboxing? lol I watch it 3days ago
Best to buy the 11 or 11 pro. Zero incentive for iPhone users to go to 12. As a reviewer or "gadget matcher" you should have a responsibility to be honest with people and tell them the 12 is just not worth the money.
Leather wallet does not stay put.... See the MKBHD Video
oh my god iPhone 12??! a new iPhone???! My iPhone X's battery will drain faster now (again) 😃✊🏽
Right, now I have to get the gold 12 pro max with a clear AND a black case. Ugh, it’s gonna be so expensive. 😩 🤦🏾‍♀️
وين العرب😂🤞🏻!!?
Please give away my idol😭😭😭
It would be better to see the gold model in the clear case.
Pangarap ko talaga to.
I originally wanted silver but seeing the gold in person made me change my mind it’s so clean and nice looking
I am not here watching your face
This review was Gold!
cant wait for my gold iPhone 12 pro max to come in smshajnfnakdjw
Great review, awful phone.
Already ordered it and wanted to see it, thanks so much! ❤
Man I really want this phone, kind of tired of my andriod.
EYLOGHTEPATER
Watching this on my Samsung j6  #broke
I have a green 11 pro but IF/when I upgrade I’m unsure what color I’d get. Blue is my favorite color, but that gold is legit.
Literally every other YouTube “the magnets are not strong enough to securely hold the wallet in place while pocketing the phone” this guy “the magnets are SO secure, it even holds it on while putting in or taking out of my pocket”
I died because you didn’t try on all the cases 🥺
Wish I didnt buy an Iphone 11 pro 5months ago...
I got mine in Gold & I did an unboxing on my channel if any of you guys would wanna check it out! <3
https://youtu.be/VAAS5AKXSMI
Block and report and report
Main question: Should I get the gold or the blue one?
Dem bezels tho
Damn the gold is still the nicest
Stunning!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I wonder if Apple will release leather cases or if we’ll just stick with the silicone cases.
This is the gold model i want not the rose gold 🤮🤮🤮
are you seriously saying you made yesterday the first iphone 12 pro gold video ??? i saw Russian guys unboxing it a few days ago ... seems that you are the last with this video
Great video, brush your teeth
I really like the way you talk. 😊
How tf do you have anywhere less than 3 million subs your videos are high quality and 🔥
Jamás había visto a alguien cromarle tanto la polla a Apple 😱
..Hey look, another iSheep preaching to feebleminded Sheepeoles
The first Iphone 12 unboxing I watched 🤩
They are really recycle king.congrats apple.hoping that soon the battery will sold seperaely .
i was never a iphone fan, but OH GOD I WANT THIS SO BADLY
You got thinner and slim😱
Who cares, let’s be honest man.. the 12 sucks ass
Foh
Most people use their phone for basic communication purposes and web surfing.  Aside from the previously mentioned use cases, people also use their phones to waste time. These phones are more powerful than the computing power of what NASA was using in the Apollo missions yet they use these absurdly powerful 1000 dollar devices to film tik tok dances. Let that sink in...
Is that ANOTHER CAMERA
Why is Sam Sung talking about iPhone in this video
Video starts at 2:24
IPHONE 12 WHITE REVIEW PLEASE ❤️❤️✨✨✨✨✨
Thanks for the video, you are the first to show the camera comparison with the zoom.
ok now to trade in 2 macbook pros, ipad mini 2, and iphone X to hopefully afford a new 12  Pro lol
Why unboxing an iphone  is exciting?  Sheep , herd mentality! No more innovation from this company !
complete waste of money
Dislike for lying about the stickiness of the magsafe!

Can you buy me a phone for my birthday🎊🎁❤ please I know you don't know me but it would be a blessing to even touch an iPhone because I never owned one 😔I'm from Jamaica 🇯🇲🌴
Hmmmmm I disagree. It looks like something Borat would carry
Yuk🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
You have the voice intonation of a ten year old🤪
Gold color is always the best color for me, luv it ❤️❤️❤️
Can we see more phone & less face???
I am missing jet black from iPhone 7, was the best color ever, in my opinion
Ugly phone
hola
This mans voice is just soothing ngl, and I love the edits this vid has
iPhone 12: hey can I copy your homework? iPhone 11: sure just change it a little iPhone 12: sureee
why shiny sides with matt back on the 12 pro ? and matt finish sides with shiny back on 12 ?  I would love the the matt side on the 12 pro with matte back
Very stunning reviews from this articulate vlogger! But so sorry I didn’t like it because I loved it!!! ❤️
great video thanks for doing this.
Too broke to relate to anything in this vid ¯\_༼ ಥ ‿ ಥ ༽_/¯
Will gagsafe be any good?
I pray who ever reads this becomes successful, God bless you 100%!
Superb superb review as always!
Thank you for the gold unboxing!!!!!
The wallet doesn’t seem secure
The wallet is such a fail for a $2trillion company. Falls out your pocket, doesn’t align when you snap it on. Terrible product
LOL. The whole wallet sifted just by adding a card into it.  Not secure enough.
Just wanted to say, this is an extremely well done video. Not only visually, but the writing, structure, and delivery. Keep it up!
Beem waiting for a gold review😪 all I see is blue everywhere.
You gotta love that boxy edges! Thanks for bringing it back, Apple!
I can buy the PS5 + games instead
😐
I wanted a iphone se all screen. I think the mini is too big
OMG you're on the top trending video in the US 😍
it would have been nice if they reduced the price since they ditched earphones and brick charger.
Love the gold iPhone thanks for showing you are awesome.

Poor choice of music for a phone unboxing.
iPhone 12 pro gold color almost looks like iPhone 11 pro gold color. Because of the different design it looks bit different and nice
Seven steps to *YOUR* salvation and *ETERNAL LIFE*  1) *YOU* have *SINNED* (Romans 3:23) 2) The wages of *YOUR* sin is separation from God and eternal death, in the *BURNING FIRES OF HELL FOREVER* (Romans 6:23) 3) To avoid this fate and go to heaven, *YOU* must be *PERFECT* because God is *PERFECT* (Revelation 21:27) 4) *YOU* will never be perfect because *YOU* have sinned, so *YOU* need a *SAVIOUR* since *YOU* cannot earn heaven by *YOUR* works (Ephesians 2:8-9) 5) Jesus Christ *IS* God; who came in the flesh, lived a *PERFECT* life and died, as a *SUBSTITUTE* for *YOUR* sins (2 Corinthians 5:21) 6) All God demands is that *YOU BELIEVE* in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ; that *HIS BLOOD* washes away *ALL* of *YOUR* sins and makes *YOU* perfect (John 3:16, John 6:47, Romans 10:9-10, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4) 7) Now *YOU* cannot go to hell because *YOU* have *NO* sins to pay for. Jesus *PAID* for *ALL* of *YOUR* sins. *YOU* have received the *FREE GIFT* of *ETERNAL LIFE* and will go to heaven (1 John 5:13)..
Classy as hell gold
100 % you'll need to buy a power brick and a head phone. Its just a marketing strategy.  Carbon neutral your self apple! And for what it cost w/o those???
Wait marques brownlee showed how the magsafe card holder falls off the phone when you take it in/out of pant pocket
I want the iPhone mini though.... And just buy the extra cash for hero 9. Can't really use iPhone on harsh environment or travel situations.

I love Apple 🍎
Here it is explained better    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vit_SyWAOCw
2,800mah batt? Good luck with that battery life.
apple brilliant
Asian Linus
Annoying
how about a video on if someone like me have an 11 pro max should upgrade to a 12 or 12 pro?
Great review! That gold is very cheap flea market watch gold though.
Cool! I love videos about Gold iPhones, expensive af, as a matter of fact I'm viewing this on my S20 FE
Phone that dont have power brick out of the box is stupid...sorry i love all of your video but apple is scamming people on a whole new level..
GOLD iPhone 12 Pro Max for sure!
Michael Josh: "I've never been a fan of gold anything"  Me: same, same
I liked the gold color in renders but now.. nah. It seems too light. Doesn't even seem like gold that much. I think S9's gold colour was the gold-est color. I'd like to see it on other phones too.
I’m waiting for the pacific blue..
I'll rather remain without any phone in my life than buy a phone without charger, I can't be that stupid!
Sad thing its  Php120,000😭😭😭  that's the best iphone ever!!! i guess my parents would not aloud me to buy expensive iphone 12 pro or  iphone 12😭😭😭😭💔 But ty for showing us
Due to carbon emissions factor apple should have removed the iPhone too 😅
I I’m gonna cop the 12 pro max but I don’t know which colour to get, suggestions?
❤️👍☺️
If someone gives me one of theses..!😕
I hope he compares the battery life of the new iPhones to older ones
Can't wait to get my hand laid on ip12 pro
Jeremiah 29:13 “You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart”   1 John 1:9 “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins; and cleanse us from all unrighteousness”.
This is the one i looking for
*Hey ... to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
what color would you choose between gold, pacifc blue, or graphite
If it's not an IP68 Lifeproof case, it's not a case!!!! Recommend this investment, thank me later!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gold digger......
I’m torn on blue or gold for my pro max - had a XS max pro gold then a 11 pro max midnight green - now I’m not sure
I am getting the gold one 🥰🥰
I don’t know what you’ve been through (yes you) but God does, we all acquire wounds through life physical, mental and spiritual. God wants to heal you but He can only do so if you let Him. I know life can be tough but God is loving, merciful and gracious and if you are reading this He can still use you, save you and heal you. Jesus is The Way, The Truth and The Life without Him there is only death. He can turn your life around I am a witness to God’s glory, hallelujah, He can turn your mess into a message.
If you are seeing this I hope everything is going okay in life and I wish you the best ❤️ -sending love from a small YouTuber
I hate how they are making me wait longer for the 12 Pro Max
I wish the mini had one too.
Beautiful but it’s all skin.  Think different alright. Apple U S of A is yet to build their 5g network, very slowly. As an investor we can roll the dice that outside of the US this phone rocks because of 5g network already available.   In U S they sell their phone then build their 5g network unlike the other, think differently, well 5g already ready all it need is their 5g device.   Your phone look awesome with latest and greatest but i f your 5G network ain’t ready here in America. Sell it over seas not here in US
Video Star at 6:50
3 cameras doesn't make a phone worth 1200$ stop letting these companies rob you. Sticking with my 8 plus until the bitch dies.. still as fast and smooth as day one:
Good review 👍
That gold is sick!!!!!
Not gonna lie the stainless steel might just be cleaner then my suit
Man I really thought this was an old ad for an iPhone 11
https://youtu.be/XMob9XdzgM0
iPhone 12 pro do Does it have real gold paint
No one cares
Sorry to interrupt unboxing, suppressed video, man clearing name about What Biden knew about family’s foreign business dealings, https://youtu.be/aiiSq7toqlQ
Now this Gold is the big deal 👍, it's much similar to the real gold than what it was in old versions.
Millions of new iPhone user will buy the iPhone 12. Apple it's try to save the planet by eliminating the power brick. But those new user will have to buy new power brick, meaning contamination will continue.  🤦🏽‍♂️
41...42....43eeeeee... 44
But the real question is... Will it get you laid? Will females come flying at you because you have a Gold Iphone 12..
Thank you! I couldn't decide between the Pacific Blue and Gold ... Your video helped!!!!!
Apple products are dogshit. Before Steve Jobs passing, it was a different story. Now you're just paying top dollar for an apple logo.
Did apple only apply a special coating on gold or other colors too?
FINALLY SOMEONE BOUGHT THE GOLD THE BLUE IS SO OVERHYPED
The iPhone 12 in white is the classiest
Yesssss, this is the color i was waiting for. Can you also do a battery test of the 12pro and comment on it?
One of the best vids on the iPhone 12/ 12 Pro. I love your genuine, to the point reviews. Thanks Michael 🙏☺️
This whole process of gradually accumulating information about oneself implies time, chronological and psychological. Time is a factor that shapes the brain to a particular condition.
i thought the mag was build into the phone not case
Same old designs iPhone from years, that camera layout is horrible, and removed the charger, wired, wireless and earphones, which costs 150 dollars more, heavy cost for 64GB, one must be fool to buy this one or must have unaccounted money to waste on the name of Apple, and apple is also looking for these kind of people for sure, Huawei is certainly more creative.
im just Glad you got the GOLD one
I really don’t think the camera in the pro is much better IMO.  I’d upgrade because of the looks, RAM and storage though.

Do y’all know what’s the price for this iPhone 12

why didnt you show any macro of the actual gold material. rest of your content is so forced. stop acting so forcibly enthused
Annddd THIS video pops up just when I convinced myself to get the midnight blue.... HI AGAIN GOLD ;D

Thankfully someone revoew good so sick of blue
*Innovation has left the chat*
Ang sarap manood ng phone unboxing kahit diko kayang bilhin😅🤣
Waiting for 12 pro max
Clear case looks horrible
wowww 😍 i'm planning to buy that gold ♥️♥️ plus i really love the way your review it
I have always liked your reviews, in depth and detailed. Things lacking on other YT channels. Keep it up, Michael Josh!
Its the same gold shade as the 11 pro, not sure why you’re saying this year’s model is different
Finally gold unboxing
https://youtu.be/O5-D9l0ZBJM
https://youtu.be/O5-D9l0ZBJM
I will do a gold 256 12 pro review tomorrow 10/23 b4 8pm
My 12 pro gold 256 come in tomorrow ima do a short review
Black silicone case look cool on the gold iPhone 12 pro
Jerryrigeverything iPhone 12 you cant scape
I do love the new pacific blue but I was curious on the gold as well and it's so beautiful. But I didn't need all those extra features so I just ordered the 12 in white, and I'm glad it was in this video too
You look like a guy that sells fish
The only guy online to feature a Gold Version
I think iPhone 11 was better
Your voice sounds similar to Linus Tech Tips.
The $39 mag safe charger doesnt come with a wall connector.  Think about that for a second.   Their greed is becoming ridiculous.   They charge $19 more for the wall charger.
Dont play along with their lies about why they stopped the chargers and headphones.  Its just Apple greed straight up sold to millennials whose brains freeze when anyone says the incantation “good for the environment”.
How do I get the gold Apple Watch face?
I dont think those 2x zoom cropped photos were from 12. They were the exact same. Double check
Almost all the stuff this guy said about magsafe is just straight up untrue....wonder why he would lie to everyone
Not gold enough
Finally a gold video. I ordered gold and I want to see how it looks like. Thanks.
Finally. I’ve been waiting to see the gold
Great review!  iPhone gold is 🔥
I think two stickers would not hurts the environment.
Adds are out of control

Love from Singapore 💓💓
Nope you’re not the first person review the gold iphone 12.
Does the gold color look girly? When they switched to rose gold I lost interest but at some angles it looks like a nice gold but other angles the back looks like a creamy pinkish color.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🚩 Non-Duality
Damn .-. It sucks putting a case on that 0.0
Amazing unboxing and hands on review as always stay safe bro 🙏
I wish they made the gold one more gold colored on the back, I want a Gold and Gold iPhone, not a Gold and Cream iPhone
Wonder if my  credit card is effected by magnet 🤔
I’m getting gold too. Again 😅
Everyone is saying that the wallet doesn't stay in place when putting it in your pocket
https://youtu.be/mjkQYvJf4H0 .
I would spend $200 on a phone where power consumption is 20% faster than previous models. It's a no Brainer.
What you will do of two phones gift that iPhone 12 to me sir 🙏
Thank you for showing us good!
No 120 hertz. sorry apple maybe next year
0:52 Techmeout did it already
Count down to Pick  up the iPhone 12 pro 🙃
Can talk a little slower?
Well damn, for a second I thought a woman was speaking haha. Great video and the gold really looks stunning!
Who else likes watching these videos but know they wont be able to get these phones because there too expensive😪
Thanks for having the 11 Pro and the 12 Pro size comparison. Was really wondering how much bigger it was. It really is not as bad as I though.
srs the photos on the iphone 12 looked better imo
"You may find this interesting" YESSS im dying for a good gold iphone 12 take that last more than 5 seconds
Been looking around all over YouTube and Wala! Thank you for having a Gold series unboxing. Can't wait for your user review for the pro series and Pro Max too!
Definitely going for Gold in the 12 Pro Max! That will work perfectly for my YouTube videos! Plus Upgrading from the 11 Pro Max! Already have the 12 and 12 Pro Max Cases from Nomad ready to go!
Waiting to preorder iphone 12 pro max Gold color next few weeks
The pocket wallet test was interestingly cut in a   way that you didn’t see him putting it in 🥴
Haha. Funny how the advertisement that appeared was Samsung 😅😅
I am waiting for the MINI, already have pro model :)
At 5:30, what would happen if it were a clear case?
Nope, looks crass and bling. Like cheap gold plating.
an iphone review with samsung ad lol
I love this review
How much for magsafe?
Disliked and stoped watching after hearing you liying about the wallet thats holds sooo strongly and you can insert it in your pocket without it falling off. Definately biased....
Good job, very easy to see differences. Im getting gold pro.Maybe it will match my gold stainless steel Apple Watch.
Rehashed design sucks.
constructive criticism: lose the background music.
Omegaaa😱😱😱😱😱😍😍😍😍❤️❤️🙏🌹🌹🌹
pouch where to buy 12pro or 12pr omax
Just the kind of review that I need!!
Just the kind of review that I need!!
Beautiful video, thank you.
HEY MAN YOUR ARE GIVE US THE PERFEKT IPHONE 12 PRO VIDEO AND THE ONLY  AWESOME GOLD COLOR  YOU ARE THE ONLY 1 YOUTUBER   PRESENT THE GOLD COLOR ARE PERFEKT CHOICE   THANK YOU  !!!!!!!!!
That gold looks like white
Calling BS on the wallet staying in place. I’ll be curious to hear reports after some time in the field.
Gold is for sure the best looking color on this phone 🤩🤩🤩
8:32 to me the XS looks thinner and more sleek. I have an XS and admire thin design. I don’t plan on upgrading till notch goes away and we get 120 hz refresh rate.
I wish there were more lighter colored silicone cases
Thank you so much for the video I am torn between blue and gold
- Same Old Boring Design - Big Ugly Notch - Lack of Higher Refresh Rate - Slowest Charging among other Flagship even compared with Midrange - Paying Extra to get a CHARGER! - Even Magnetic charger in separate payment ONLY support 15 Watt  I'm really sorry to say this, but there's very thin layer to difference between Style and Dumb..
You are unique. You picked gold. All the other reviewers use blue. I’m getting gold You are very good in this review Sheila
172 people so far putting thumbs down just because they can’t afford it 😭
Cant wait to get my 12 pro gold! Need to wait a week😢😢😢
Can’t wait for the 12 Pro Max review
The music is horrible
Those Magsafe cases already looking like garbage after a few days due to the magnet,   https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/magsafe-leaves-marks-on-silicon-12-pro-case-after-only-one-day-of-use.2262597/?post=29090232#post-29090232
Dude it’s very simple explanations.... thanks for sharing this  video
Let me be brutally honest. This is a great content, but please change your editor. The sounds/visuals/music just doesn't fit. That would change your yt career from advanced to pro. Good luck!
Aluminum is a better conductor of signals and nobody needs a telephoto.  Honestly I don’t know how anyone buys the 12 Pro
In india 12 pro cost is 1600 dollars 💵 😑
It's official, I've decided I wanna get the Gold Pro Max when it comes out
Gold colour is looking fantastic but don’t like one thing that is apple logo. It is not as visible as in pacific blue 🧐
You had one job...to just show us the gold phone with the clear case on it.
الايفون اللون الذهبي روعه ❤️
At laaaast! I was waiting for your unboxing since 2 days agoooo😁 Love love from Philippines😁😊
Wow, they're taking away all the chargers, earphones, etc? What a total rip-off, people are SO, SO stupid for buying this as though it doesn't matter anymore. If people started getting together to boycott so that the company doesn't rip us off, we wouldn't be. But selfish, careless people don't think it matters. You're the reason the world gets worse :) Bravo!
Its not the first gold iphone unboxing hate to kill your vibe
iphone 11 is also going to 5G?
That battery eww
Apple said my iPhone going to be with me by the 9th how the hell does that work!?! I even pre ordered like cmon Apple
I wait for iPhone 12 pro MAX . But i don’t know wich color 🤔🙈🙈
Great review!!
I'm love with the gold colour!!! Thanks for this video ❤️
The AD here is samsung😂
Great video man!!!
So no where has anyone gone into depth about the front camera.
not even close its more look like white or something
Can you compare this gold with the 11 Pro gold?
I think @techmeout got it a little bit before you
Finally someone who chose the Gold, not that “not so beautiful” blue
Preordered same color
Early...🙂🤗😘😍
So end of the day, all iPhone 12, 12pro and 12 pro max users definitely needs to buy it's smart battery case! Battery is so small 🤔😒
the wallet does come off when putting it in your pocket
Seeing the size comparisons was just what I needed.  Thanks!
finally, someone who didn't get the pacific blue color
Love you bro
Perhaps gold look better than pacific blue
I need this Gold. Not that blueish.
So nice and interesting introducing for these iPhones.
Great video. Kudos.
I LOVE YOU, everyone talkin about the blue one and unboxing ONLY the blue one. I think the gold one is a big BIG yes this year and NOBODY is talking about it
I was waiting for that review the gold iPhone 12 Pro
Waiting for the pro max that 6.7 is big
I think Apple mastered “Gold” better with the iPhone XS MAX... because of the glossy glass back it looks more gold I honestly hate the new matte finishing they are doing on all pro models because it takes away from the color on the back... it looks like a Creme back with gold edges... 😒 I’m still gonna get it tho because my xs max is slow as hell now.
So beautiful. Thank you Michael Josh and Gadgetmatch! I was waiting for a gold iPhone unboxing!
Sorry but TechMeOut beat you to it! She was the first to review the gold! Nice second though.
Love you bro
You deserve more subscriber
Very underrated tech youtube channel
F*** the blue; I want that gold!
What Amazing phone ❤👍 & review
finally someone did the gold unboxing. i cant wait to get my iphone 12pro 256GB Gold color. i pre order on friday the 16th. dude that gold look so amazing
Great, you're the first to unbox the gold pro.👌 👌 😀
This guy got a deep fake face
Thnks for gold one @GadgetMatch
Both colours are my fav
I’m definitely buying the 12 in this color
I'm slapping a black dBrand skin on just the back of the 12 Pro. It's gonna look sick with those gold frame and accent. Can't wait
The gold wasn’t what I thought it was gonna be, but it’s still nice... may go with the blue
I thank you and techmeout for unboxing and showing the gold pro cause that’s the one I preordered then my usual silver and I must say I’m very please with my decision.
Is that a gigantic Note 12 Ultra behind you? 😂
Wow .. I think I need gold instead of blue, very good video thanks
I hope someone makes a case that actually blocks the magnet
for the gold u got my like n sub !
Good review#techlatitude
20 watts is fast? 🤔
First iphone golden unboxing by #techmeout 🤟🏼🤟🏼
Backlight bleed of tv behind you is just massive,i'll gues it's a lcd tv.
That gold coated teeth though 🤮
The wallets do fall off when pulling it out and putting it in your pocket.  I wouldn't recommend one.
The best unboxing ever
I like to watch things i can't have
Its verry comfortable to watch gadget match Verry clear and well explained vlogging, looking forward for your first million subscriber,  “Your fan since day one”
Apple things 2020 : pay more and get less
2k/4k please ...........
my dream phone I phone 12
Love ur videos bro 🥰
This guy is obviously paid to talk real good about apple cause if u watch brownlee’s video he keeps it real especially about mag safe this guy sucks 👎
I miss the green from the 11 pro last year. Plan on purchasing the 12 pro max this year. I had settled on the silver, but the more I see the gold the more it becomes a toss up.
iPhone 11 or iPhone 12? Or even iPhone SE
Amazing review! Love it
When Xiaomi is going with 144hz refresh rate Apple still sticks with outdated 60hz with heavy pricing 😵
Watching this because I want to support gadgetmatch. After learning that iphone 12 models have smaller batteries, I'll stick to my galaxy m20 for another year.
I think this Gold iPhone 12 Pro will win the most beautiful phone of the year
Finally A gold Unboxing!!!🥰
I found a couple people inbox gold earlier
Good accent and good introduction. Keep it up.
I love the edges in gold finish but the back side disappointed, looks white lol.. I'm surely going with the underrated graphite looks awesome 🤩🤩
Atleast apple should have included LiDar scanner with non pro model like they did with ipad. LiDar scanner would compensate telephoto lens ☹️😐 Really disappointing.
You’re perfectly right! There is no unboxing on IPHONE 12 gold color you did it 😍 I really love this video CAUSE THIS VIDEO IS WAY TOO DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS YOUTUBERS 🤩
ᴡʜᴇɴ ʟᴀᴜɴᴄʜ ᴀᴛ ᴍᴀʟᴀʏsɪᴀ?
I could watch your personality all day long!  Very articulate.  ❤️❤️❤️
Waiting for a camera comparison to a sub 1k mirrorsless camera vs the iphone pro max. Since photographer and videographer knows sensor size  and better lens matters specially getting a descent shot in low light and tricky light condition
Excelente unboxing. Saludos de Guatemala 🇬🇹❤️
Actually I saw a gold iPhone 12 pro unboxing yesterday in YouTube...
Gimme one pls!!😂🤑😍
I don’t care about apple
wow
going for gold....no next question
I think you missed the ram is different. Iphone 12 pro 6gb and iphone 12 4gb.
I’m pretty sure only the pro can record Dolby vision HDR. Please fact check.
MKHB video demonstrate the leather wallet to come loose when he put it on his pocket. Seems a totally opposite from your video
So ang tanong magkano siya dito sa Pinas sa Power Mac Center? 😂
Loved your review, thank you so much!! Also thanks for showing the gold iPhone pro since ALL YouTubers are unboxing the same blue one
I wonder what will happen to the previous phones that they critique since they have a new phone or phones? Can I have those old models like the iphone 8 or even 7? 🤣😅 haha nice review btw.
Watching from Thailand
Not the first unboxing of the gold one
와 쉬바 이쁜 거 봐라...
I hate sides of iphone 12 looks much thicker than iphone x xs and 11
looks ugly. same design same ugly notch nothing new
Thank you sooooosososooo much for answering the question I had since MagSafe chargers were announced: will it work with non-MagSafe case?
Thats Bad for about charger and earpids
Surprise surprise, Josh chose gold over blue, how would that be possible? Hahaha
Once Gold always the Gold
Apple only focused on 5g but didn't improve the battery capacity.
For the love of God THANK YOU for getting the gold one! I swear if I saw another blue iPhone review I was going to scream 😩
Gotta say, fantastic video! Thanks for pointing out how the differences in manufacturing process for the gold model doesn't affect smudge resistance.
Just ordered the iPhone 12 pro in Gold!! 😁 Can't wait! My current phone is iPhone 7 so big upgrade for me!
Gold iphone 12 pro max 256gb its a major major major major major go
Where did you get your Apple Watch band?
Love this two color!!! that gold color look premium and luxury
When Apple’s Gold iPhone started becoming more expensive than Gold, SMFH, it started from iPhone 8 and continues.
Finally 😂 looks like everyone got sent pacific blue
I was leaning IPhone 12 pro in blue, but after watching this, I’m going for the Gold!!
Probably the only channel which perfectly scales the iPhone specs to fit full screen. Enjoy it more in full screen on phone. Awesome channel
I’ve been waiting for a review on the new Gold Stainless Steel colour for the iPhone 12 Pro, so thank you for this video! My heart remains set on the brand new Pacific Blue colour for the iPhone 12 Pro Max! The fact rumours said the Gold colour received less smudges and scratch marks made me question which colour to grab, but you’ve cleared things up for me.
Definitely the first gold unboxing on YouTube nice
Baterry is so small.. 😭
I pray who ever reads this becomes successful, God bless you
The Gold looks much better in your video than on Apple Website. I’ll choose the gold now.
Marecelito, Can you sing "The Prayer"?
Can’t wait to get my 12 pro max in white/silver. Love the stainless steel sides ❤️
Watching this on my ancient iPad mini 2👍😀
Iphone 12 👍👍
smudge... resistant... ha... Haha... HAHAHA yeah right
The iPhone 12 looks like the dummy phone. I don't like this design.
I'm indian boy
How ironic that you reviewed it nicely here while  you bash it through blogs/ articles you posted on facebook for not being competitive enough with other brands. Lol!
its about time for the gold, everyone talking about that damn blue.
FINALLYYYYY A GOLD UNBOXING OMG I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR 1 WEEK
This guy sounds like ijustine.
Your are the 1st YouTuber to unbox Gold Color. Thanks 😊
Really love the pro colors. Really hate the outline glossy finish though and would have preferred they stuck to the 11 pros concept where it's all matte. fingerprints all over is such an ugly sight
I think Iphone should take consider to offer the charger brick if the user wants it. Especially if they are new users.
Thank you for being the first gold unboxing
Dubai Style :)
Hi, i’m divided between iphone 12 pro gold vs pacific blue, can you do special video comparing these two colors?
You exactly look 👀 like Sunil Chhetri  (An Indian football superstar)
iphone 13 : no screen
Right gold iphone in your title!!! That's tight hhhh
Appel: Kidney kidney kidney   Me:👉🏼👌🏻🍎                                    🙂
Jet Li is a tech YouTuber so blessed 🤣
Would you prefer the gold or the graphite for the the iPhone 12 pro max
Can't wait for Josh's review on the Huawei Mate 40 Pro XD
💃🏾💃🏾
Great presentations. Would you please make a video about samsang Galaxy note note 10 Lite     specially its camera review and some tips and tricks
The wallet stayed in place in your pocket because you were pinching on it against the phone when carefully pulling it out. Cheeky, you must be protecting your Apple relationship
Not worth it
That's a poor battery size decision for both iPhones
Kumquat
Need to work hard for 2 months 😞
another: 4GB vs 6GB RAM
Very well done video
We lost adapter , earphone and apple stiker but we pay more. oh apple🥺
I’ve been waiting for iPhone 12pro new gold unboxing. Nice bro
I’m waiting to get the iPhone 12 pro max because I take many photos for famous people
You got the best 2 colours...👏
beutiful
im so happy the gold on the back is slightly closer to white. I always get the gold but wanted to try something new this year, but decided ultimately to go Gold again because of the change in tone.
Is it really true that 5g consumes 20% of the iphone battery faster than 4g?
I have a question does the gold iPhone 12 pro look like the iPhone 8 in gold?
HI Michael Josh, Good day nice review, subscriber here since day 1 of gadget natch, I would like to ask if you had old Iphone (6,s7s0 not using that I can buy. cannot afford to buy the brand-new  iphone (6,s7s) since they are already expensive,I lost my iPhone 5s last march before pandemic happen.   if you had old iphone that you using for review can I buy  it. thank you very much more power to your channel, go 1million subscriber..Godbless
I really really love to have an iPhone! can you give me one please???
Michael Josh the god of tech reviews.
Damn, the Gold looks oh so hot! Tim  take my money! 💰🤤
what is the wireless charger brand u using? 4:57
Garbage phones
Actually your the 4th person to do the unboxing for the iPhone 12 pro in gold. Sadly
I really really love to have an iPhone! can you give me one please???
You didn’t compare the RAM size in these models. I heard that Pro has a large RAM which could make a difference.
this is apple phone reccomendations
Can u do giveaway for gold iphone pro?
Nice color
You are the 3rd person to do the gold iPhone 12 pro on YouTube sadly
I was very torn between Gold and Blue this year. I love that the stainless steel really does look like true gold this time, but I'm not a massive fan of the beige back so I went for Blue in the end
😍😍😍
❤❤❤
Now i am using iphone x which model i will buy ? iphone 12 or 12 pro
First time in so many years, Michael is not doing this unboxing in Singapore
Why don't most youtubers say anything bad about the phones, magsafe, apple told you what you can say and what you can't, its a shame they can't say what they want.
Finally someone has gold
Why did apple not provide a gold case? Seriously all the apple cases look horrible with the gold.
I don’t know why but I prefer the pro simply because 3 cameras look good lol
Ima get the max
Very annoying music
I like the Pacific blue
Ah I don't really care who does it first . For me MichaelJosh is still awesome! 😁 Love the way he reviews stuffs. 😁🤗 It would be nice to upgrade and grab the gold 😁
i think it kind of looks like a similar shade to the 8 plus, might be just me?
Am I the only who is not excited about the new iPhone12 like for me it’s like the 11 💀
Gold ATW.
Disclaimer - No Kidney were Harmed   During making of this Video
Based on camera would you recommend the Note 20 Ultra or iphone 12 Pro?
Mini.❤️❤️❤️
This is what I'm looking for
Nicely explained. Thx bro.
Finally someone unboxed it in gold ❤🙌
I’d have to see it in person, the gold is kind of ugly 😭 and that’s the one I preordered
Finally gold edition is here for review
Love this color! I am *pretending* to purchase one in this color as well!!
When will launch in Indonesia?
These new iPhones are built different 😎
I heard that iphone XR and iphone SE 2020 will come with fast charging inside the box
the gold is creamy
골드다
Gold the best color in 12 line up:)
Mkbhd had his wallet fall off when pulling out of pocket
You had the AUDACITY to have the clear case and not put it on the Gold iPhone and show it to us.
Techmeout is gold too
iPhone: Gold 12 Pro/Max Price: More than gold 😂
https://youtu.be/xGz-Wi8C4O4 nice video 👍🏻
❤️❤️
apple always make the colours look better in the advert
How much would it be priced in the PH, you always put sgd and usd.
i don’t get why this channel didn’t hit million subscribers few years ago? gadgetmatch produces high quality videos and really give an advice towards what gadgets you should buy. unlike the others who made bland/stale reviews
Can we talk about the leather wallet? In the clip, when cards were added into the wallet, it slipped off the MagSafe case! Obviously not that secure.
Less than 3000mah battery?
Philippines Here Watching Unbox ❤️
surprisingly useful. initially played in the background somehow, ended up subscribing. thank you.
I will go for gold now. I think the blue is overhyped and its not so good. I like this years gold because it is more on the yellow side and not the rosy one. Will be my first time to get a gold color phone. Who's with me??
ye im copping the silver one
nope this is not the first gopro12 gold unboxing. i was able to watch 12 hrs ago
No offend iPhone 12 looks better an i like compact size
What about RAM difference?
Why is that sometimes the apple logo on that gold color would disappear?
cool unboxing
Thanks a lot for this video Michael! Great job!
So, after publishing this video, I realized that good friend @Techmeout was the first out with a Gold iPhone 12 Pro video.  Linking her video video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqhMZ6WSR2c&t=40s
The sides look better. Now THAT'S GOLD
Apparently someone said iphone 12 pro had to be RECALL because 5G is not working? Any truth in this?
why is it so nice looking tho
Your videos are awesome, I wish you get millions of subs and likes
Mygod, never experience owning an apple,😀😀😀😀

11 and 12 are sooo similar that even if he had shown 11 pro nobody would have noticed
I’d love to see someone drop test this thing
my daily habit 😂😂😂 literally my all time habit ti watch this channel
Finally. The gold iPhone 12 pro. So curious what it looked like.  Thank you. Great video
The 12 pro in gold looks so good and premium
Here 4 the Joshy recommendation!
They still dont care about 2800 mah which will only last a few hours! Hayyyy. Not buying.
what is your nationality? im betting youre a Filipino. Great videos btw! ogranized and detailed!
Yeah, first gold 12 Pro on Youtube... But, still waiting on that Graphite 😆
best unboxing by far... but, i'm quite not sure if i will get the gold colour as the back is not what I'm expecting.... haaaaaist!  :-(
Michael, it was really nice seeing this video ! Great commentary!
I was debating if I should get the blue or the gold but I just the blue because is a new colour lol
I like the GOLD colour.
Dearest apple Please Improve Battery ✨✨
Can you tell apple to start their base model at 128gb thanks
Sadly the gold is worst than last year 💔 the back looks so creamy
The MagSafe wallet does not work well with tight pants and surely pickpockets will love this feature lol.
That gold is truly classy as hell.
actually youre the second person that doing unboxing gold 12 pro.. the first person is a woman that do unboxing 12 pro gold.. sorry but im tellin’ u the truth
I wish the back color was a true gold. It looks beige.
Screams In 11 Pro max
Thanks josh
The gold one is probably the best color this year. I got one too
this is the unboxing im waiting for... even if i can't buy this phone... 😁😁😁😁😁
He was literally trying his best to not show bad the magnetic attachments like wallet etc really are, it literally slipped off by just sliding in a credit card.
a dream that will never happen coz of my severe medical conditions  😭💔
Tought Gold would be better I'll def go for Pacific Blue
Techmeout did get gold iphone unboxing
So glad i ordered Gold its stunning!
4:20 wouldn’t you want it to come out because if it didn’t your MacBook would be dead
Never failed to give what I need to hear 💙
dude the price of iphone in Singapore hahahah
Thank god the Official Apple silicone case finally covers the bottom. The only thing that prevents me from buying one.
I think that @TechMeOut is the only one who unboxed a gold iPhone 12 pro 🤔🤔🤔🤔 I love the new form factor 🤔🤔
I was waiting for this review.
I'm really disappointed ☹️ the battery are very small 😤😯😯😯⭐
10:07 wtf, the 12 looks MUCH betther then the Pro ...
Baka sa moa next month pa nauuna pa nga ang megamall
Torn between Gold and Blue. Gold looks shiny and stunning. Also gold probably is more flexible when it comes to colored cases. Blue is my favorite color though and it also looks nice on the 12 pro. Hahaha.
Apple: We will quit the charge cube and headphones because 🍃 eco friendly 🍃. Everybody: Ok good... And you are going to sell it less expensive, Right? Apple: ✨🍃eco friendly 🍃✨
Gold just shines💎
build... different
That battery capacity is shameful
haha nice bilis
Hi Michael ! How r u ?
The gold iPhone 12 Pro is more like a beige colour.
You are a tech reviewer, for you it's useless i mean charger and headphones. But for usual people and people buying it first time they need it. But yeah, if every device comes with charges and cables than not all of them will be useful. I have so many wires lying around
First one here ♥️♥️
How come do you have iPhone 12`s already ?
watching this with my perfectly working iphone 6 😂 anyone with ip6???
Just iPhone mini
I really dont own any iphone all i can see is Sana all 😊
Goshhhh that one looks really gooddddddd
True you are the first one to inbox the Golden iPhone. 😍
You got all of my favourite colours of the new iphone 12s!!!
The coating on Gold model is much durable than other models?
