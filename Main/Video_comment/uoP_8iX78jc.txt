Lose yourself by Hank Hill
Making smiles even on the bad days.
Mickey spit all facts no Cap !
2:47 I got the magic they all on my Johnson, my chicks in the lobby😭😭
Dobby was just  Fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
SUPER GLAD TO SEE HES THE NEW brown , after the first song he made with him I knew from the beginning he should be the character! And I called it...that's so awesome
Respect
The excessive saying of "21" from 21 Savage is hilarious on it's own 😂
9:12 was my favorite 😂
Obama doesn’t play overwatch. Unrealistic!!…🤣I’m playin that ana bar was hard, you’re good at writing things that are “themed” to fit the characters, but when you limit your lyrics less, seems like you come up with some more creative, hard bars, where I can see the artist you are coming out. Keep up the good work and limits only exist if we choose to put them on ourselves.🥂
I remember when you used micky mouse in a fortnite video where you scared a kid and his little sister with the pennywise voice.
Nice voice changer
you know micky and miney are siblings
Joker was mind blowing 🤯
I know I'm late but on the Grinch part 3:24 he sounded like plankton from SpongeBob for a moment lol
7:40 is the beginning of my favorite of the whole video lol
Hey, what about that original joker voice.🔥

Al-Kahf 18:54 And We have certainly diversified in this Qur'an for the people from every [kind of] example; but man has ever been, most of anything, [prone to] dispute. An-Nisa' 4:82 Then do they not reflect upon the Quran? If it had been from [any] other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction. Fussilat 41:53 We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth. But is it not sufficient concerning your Lord that He is, over all things, a Witness? Al-Mu'minun 23:14 Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators. At-Tur 52:35 Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators [of themselves]? At-Tur 52:36  Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain. Al-Anbiya 21:30 Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe? Al-Anbiya 21:31 And We placed within the earth firmly set mountains, lest it should shift with them, and We made therein [mountain] passes [as] roads that they might be guided.     Al-Isra' 17:9 Indeed, this Quran guides to that which is most suitable and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward Al-Kahf 18:54 And We have certainly diversified in this Qur'an for the people from every [kind of] example; but man has ever been, most of anything, [prone to] dispute. An-Nisa' 4:82 Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? If it had been from [any] other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction. Al-Ma'idah 5:3  This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion.  Ash-Shura 42:25  And it is He who accepts repentance from his servants and pardons misdeeds, and He knows what you do. Al-Ma'idah 5:39 But whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms, indeed, Allah will turn to him in forgiveness. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Al-An'am 6:160 Whoever comes [on the Day of Judgement] with a good deed will have ten times the like thereof [to his credit], and whoever comes with an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof; and they will not be wronged. Hud 11:112 So remain on a right course as you have been commanded, [you] and those who have turned back with you [to Allah ], and do not transgress. Indeed, He is Seeing of what you do. Maryam 19:60 Except those who repent, believe and do righteousness; for those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged at all. Ta Ha 20:82 But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance. Al-Furqan 25:70 Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful. Al-Furqan 25:71 And he who repents and does righteousness does indeed turn to Allah with [accepted] repentance.  Al-Qasas 28:67 But as for one who had repented, believed, and done righteousness, it is promised by Allah that he will be among the successful.  Al-Baqarah 2:25 And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, "This is what we were provided with before." And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally. Az-Zumar 39:53 Say, "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah . Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful."

My bad
Does Donny need a sock to but in?
He did 21 better than 21
I want him to make a full verison of holiday with the grinch
Ik its been 8 months since u released this vid but plz read my comment. Also congrats on the voice actor position thats very profound😌🙌🏻
To full explain the Micky verse, here is what i got from it:    1. “Man Disney be taking the pain away, the magic make me feel like Blaine, okay” he is referencing Blaine Gibson aka one, if not, the original film animator and/or effects animator. As we all know Micky Mouse is a wonderful piece of art but the “magic” could refer to how Walt Disney created him in one of the LOWEST  points in his life before “losing everything” and it was somehow “magical” to him that this creation was a massive success. Also magic as in “Fantasia 1940, The Sorcerer’s Apprentice Walt Disney Cartoon Movie” which can also be found on YouTube.    2. “Stay stackin’ my bread & you know it’s all blue, Still counting the money from Frozen 2, bahh, i get the mula from all of the disney clothing too, man how many shirts do we got in blue?” As if the First Frozen wasnt a smash hit, breaking records for the biggest global animated hit of all time, while bringing in BILLIONS of dollars. But, people didnt think Frozen 2 would surpass the origional film’s income record, yet ran up to 3.2 BILLION dollars in 2019 alone with a $150 million dollar lead. Whats known as “The Frozen Effect” is that the Frozen characters themselves accumulated $107.2 BILLION in retail sales and an EXTRA 46% of the total 13.4 Billion in royalties😀🤯 Just by selling them in the stores, they were “freezing out” the attention from the other attractive licenses because of the overwhelming attention to it🥶  So yea they technically need the whole crew to count that guap! Also, every “Walt Disney Pictures” scene has a blue background, hence why blue is an important color within the franchise ALSO i dont know if anyone knew this but Disney actually closed Blue Sky Studio around 2019.     3. “Everything we own, Bought all the licenses no need for clones, okay!” Not only is this a reference to Disney buying Star Wars in 2012 for $4 Billion, but before that, Star Wars was easily one of the biggest and most successful film franchises ever made. Although some “damage” has been done to the franchise during the takeover from Disney, they have yet to put the pen down. Star Wars has returned with 3 successful movie flicks reasserting the series’ dominance since its revival in 2015. “Star Wars VII, The Force Awakens” generated a grand total $90.24 million in the box office and $2.068 in total.     4. “We dropped a movie named ‘Soul’, it blew up and Foxx won awards for ‘Soul’, okay!” On December 25th, 2020 , The movie “Soul” was released. Produced by Pixar Animations (which has also been purchased by Disney for $7.4 billion) and with the distribution of Disney, came yet another smash hit. Jamie Foxx, (also featured in the film- “In Living Color) was the star voice actor and won 2 Academy Awards: “Best Original Music Score” and “Best Animated Feature Film” in 2021.     5. “We bout’ to buy even more, We even just bought Family Guy, Ho Hoo!” Disney recently bought Family guy, along with The Simpsons and many other Television shows, during the official acquisition period from 2017-2019. They also purchased 20th Century FOX and 21st Century FOX movies AND TV series.     6. “Well, Marvel really has us blessed okay?” Disney acquired Marvel in 2009 for another $4.24 billion, with Marvel shareholders to receive $30 and approximately 0.745 Disney shares for each share of Marvel they own. and has become one of the most successful profit-making assets. Disney would’ve had their hands on Marvel even earlier if only some of the executives didn’t have their objections.   👇🏻 IF YOU ACTUALLY READ THIS GOD BLESS YOU THIS TOOK 2 HOURS TO RESEARCH😅
Cool 😎
4:43
Are you voicing Cleveland for family guy too?
Can we get these but in single sections so i can add em to my playlist
@Azerrz let me tell you how Mike Henry opened a door for you and the black community. What he did was incredible and something that comes unlikely by smart and educated white men. It may have taken him 20 years to come up with this idea and decision of stepping down to say black characters should be voiced by black people was incredible! It takes a strong and wise man to say and do something like that. Then for you to come a long way and take that position on one of America's famous TV shows as a strong, intelligent, and multitalented black man is even more amazing. I am a proud fan to say keep up the great work and enjoy this blessing. Don't just do it just to do it. Do it for your fans and especially for yourself because it took your hard work to make it there. I know I'm late to the news, but I thought you should hear some more positive and encouraging words for your accomplishment.
Nah wtf this is incredible oh my ****!!!
The baby yoda one is so cute
I love how Sylvester Stallone mumbles just like Spottemgottem
Damn I wish I was this talented! 🤦🏾‍♂️🔥🔥🔥🔥
First time I'm on this page.,and two seconds into the first impersonation I'm in love already. The Dobby impersonation? Loved it.

Azerrz mind if i use a lyric from the beatbox portion of the video
Sylvester Stallone killed it 😂
Omg I had no idea you are playing the voice of Cleveland on family guy that’s so awesome and you so deserve it keep up the good work dude!!!

If I rate this a 1 of a 200 of the times I've been watching this channel for fortnite trolling (the funny ways) skits of his personal characters, and hot on voice impressions, and raps?  I don't need to! Because he is the man of his life to this man behind the Voice (also anybody who are voice impressions!).   P. S. I also watch your rapping videos so I can copy these characters, so congrats being a cast member (Cleveland Brown) on Family Guy that I'm just here to see you being happy to everyone that misses you and you missed them.   R. I. P Mike Henry (Voice of Cleveland Brown on Family Guy and The Cleveland Show!) Legend of the crew, and you!
I'm excited ash for the song tmr

Idk if you realize but if you dedicated a whole song like that Mickey Mouse track I promise you would change the game. Grown. Men would be listening playing that shit. That shit slide. If you did characters that hard on a track.
Dobby was cool.

Congratulations!!! You have a dope thing going I can imagine the scenes they wanna do with you and your voice skills !!!
No one will ever have to question Vicky and his authority again🤣💯 you already know everyone wants part four🔥 One of my personal favorites was when Pennywise had to go stupid and everybody💀💯 I think a great song for you though would be crash dummy bye Quinn NFN for part four. P.S. i’m sure a lot would agree that they were dead when Dolby gave them all the Durkio
Super talented, we want past 4!!! I heard @Azerzz do a Will Smith adlib in the last video. I would love to see Will Smith playing COD. 😂
The idea hit me. For part 4 we need him to do a back and forth with Archer and Bob Belcher!!
The Mickey was terrible ngl

Black ⚫ panther🔥🔥🔥🔥

ESTI SMECHER FRATE , TE SUSTINEM DIN ROMANIA !!!
Bro it’s crazy he’s blew up up bro dang 🤯
Azerrz doing Mickey Mouse looks like he's in labour and yet he still spits fire (btw Joker verse was some of the best music I've ever heard)
Am I the only one undecided if T'challa or Joker won the prize for flow sicker than a serial killer?
I want to buy that Mickey mix tape
Arnold Schwarzenegger lmfaoo 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Missed you man💪🏼💪🏼
I missed hit rap in voice impressions
The third and second one hits different and joker

NO JOKE  DababyYODA (& Mando) Dobby Arnold Schwarzenegger Grinch & The Joker  Should ALL become regulars alongside Manny, Barack Obama, 21 Savage, Stewie, Cleveland, and Kendrick  Also Azerrz would love to see ya create more of your own original characters!!!
That Doofensmirtz flow was 🔥🔥🔥
Dobby verse stuck in my head
like the new  intro
Ohhh naw, lil nas x has been canceled sir 😭
Drop leave me already!!!!!!!
Try Richthofens voice from cod
Maybe we'll get to see joker in family Guy? Also i thought i fly was buzzin my ear one Arnold Schwarzenegger part.
I watch so many reactions but none talked about that pennywise bar "See I say my name pennywise but for some reason when people are scared they just call me "IT". bar of the year
We’ll see what Disney buying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What if his real voice is just an impression..?
7:02
part 4 pllllsssss
How dose he do this
Mickey went off no cap
If Family Guy does a live action episode or movie, Azzers could still be Cleveland Brown
Bro Mickey was spittin
Y'know, Stewie, Joe and Herbert's VAs could all call in sick on the same day and Arif would still make it work.
Bro this shit is crazy bro keep up the good work bro💪🏼
You need to do jar jar binx and spongebob like if u agree
Brooooo you should do betrayed by Scarface that would slapppp 💯

Azerrz l think you should create a short youtube channel and post voice rap with character but one for each short that would be amazing.
Pennywise had the best verse. I think you should make it an official song.

RIP The Legend Chadwick Boseman
For beat box you should have done stewie
Love the intro
Bonus track was a good tribute to both
Pennywise and Joker need a full song together in my opinion. Loved it all but those two were by far my favorites (besides Welcome to Wakanda).
Joker verse was incredible
That edit for cap and Sam was hard when he through him the shield
RIP BLACK PANTHER
You can’t see me through the gun smoke
Lol when he was singing and said don’t call me lando that’s basically my name but it’s spelled Alando which is pretty cool to hear him say that...🙈😂
Bro I remember when he used to do voice trolls on GTA and everything and he still does but now he is still a hard working man and now the voice of a iconic character like it's crazy how long I have been subscribed to u now that I think of it
The Arnold one at the beginning was funny. He went like “NYAAAH”.
"Bitch its Dobby"  That line truly hit different💆😹
BROOO! WHAT CANT HE DOOO? SINCE WHEN DOES HE HAVE A MARK HAMILL JOKER IN HIS BAG?
You need to do a full joker song i have watched it multiple times since this came out by far the greatest part
You should do a frieza voice the joker you did in this when you said damn at the end almost sounded just like him in dragon ball super and I loved the grinch that was dope I think that was my favorite so was the joker tho so I can’t pick a favorite from those two
original music sounds good at the end sounds like it would be played at the end of a vanoss video
Bro You should go through drive throughs
Azerrzs is a 🐐
Mickey Mouse was sliding on What's Next 🔥🔥
Mickey goin hard we need a full song

This is how LA celebrities should be like, on their shit, on their grind, independent, sponsoring himself, absolutely saluted
Me waiting for the Trump verse like 👀👀
That doofenshmirtz part hit different
Question: since you're the voice of Cleveland does that mean you won't be doing that impression on YouTube anymore? Dunno if you can profit off of intellectual property outside of family guy due to contractual agreements and what nots.
Do more uncle ruckus
Part were arnold said squeeze ur butt I was literally crying 😂

That was delicious @Azerrz
I'm glad he made dr. Doofenshmitz's verse clean and have no curse words.

OMG DOBBY!!! Rip 😟
The best I swear
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming

Mickey snapped
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do these things, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife  .   You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make.   Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 )  ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’  .

"Still counting that money from Frozen 2" -Mickey mouse  Mickey and Joker had the best tho
jokers part🦾💯
The rocky one go hard 🔥🔥
It’s so cool that Azerrz pays respect to the original Cleveland voice actor. It’s pretty stupid that America is so racist that it cares about the race of cartoon characters, but it’s cool that Azerrz seems to realize that. He’s always been a great guy. Azerrz getting the role is the best thing that could’ve came from such a bad situation.
The black paint
That shit had me popping off in gaming
*21*
Now I’m mad 21 didn’t do a beatbox remix cuz we need that 😭😭🔥🔥🔥
Could you do a Mortal Kombat character
He's using a voice changer
Wow
Been waiting for this forever
Mans went crazy with all these voices yooooooo🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🙌🏾
5:10 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yo that song bout to be on repeat when It drops
Weird suggestion but I wanna request an impression for part 4. I want you to do an impression for Big the Cat from the sonic the hedgehog franchise. That would be amazing if you did that. I'm not sure if you know who that is so that's why I mentioned he's from sonic. I'll leave you with this. "Froggy". recommend you look at some cutscenes of this guy(paticulary sonic heroes,sonic andventure and sonic x(that's a show)) and you'll gather an idea of who he is.
Joker was lit tho
21 was fire 🔥
Bout time they had an actual brother voice Cleveland Brown
need a full joker song plz hahaha
It feels so nice to see the progression on his intro thu the years
White shark approved go time
Those joker adlib laughs are so gooooood.

Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise.

John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23-For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9-That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10-For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen

The intro of the song hot hard  Up,up 🤣
I’ve been watching Azerrz since his voice trolling videos on black ops 2. He has really come a long way. From making little voice impressions in call of duty lobbies to making his own music and becoming the voice actor of Cleveland Brown. This just shows how much you can accomplish in your life. Let’s not forget to mention, the creativity he has when it comes to learning the voices of characters and coming up with lyrics. Not only for parody songs but his own music in general. He is absolutely incredible! Keep up the amazing work Azerrz and keep bringing us this amazing content!!
how did he do the Dr Doofenshmirtz one
You are insane azzers, the detail is insane in every part of the video! True talent!👏 part 4 pls
When you want to steal someone's identity this is what profession you start doing
Lofl "Draco cant really box"                                     *Rocky 2021*

Hahaha man! I was smiling the whole time , this is too on point!
HOLY SHIT YOU GOT THE PART?!?!?!?
Joker went off
Joker too lit
Im sad it wasnt longer. 😢 The video and lyrics were great. Keep doing what you are doing, Azerrz. I hope we wont have to wait long for another great video. Your creativity inspire me to push my dreams into reality. Thanks for all the hard work you put into each video. I know being a youtuber is not an easy job.
Azerrz! Keep up the grind, and man you have bars! I do have a question for you tho. Im really interested in your new job with Clevelands voice, do they have a any rules with conflicts of interest? Like your youtube channel? Can they touch it? If it starts making you more money then the voice of family guy, and you put more effort into youtube then family guy. What happens? Cuz like my brother works for the state as an hedge fund auditor and they have rules for conflicts of interest, like you have to report another incomes. I know that's the state and family guy is Hollywood. But thats why I'm asking. Just curious and want to be educated. Love the vids my dude!
Honestly 21 verse hella lit bro 🔥 keep it up, wouldn't surprise me if he actually did it :'D
Obama best one keep it up azerrz
Wow you have a very long way
Bro the 21 verse was fye no cap

This is talent.
It's easy to feel hopeless and alone in a fallen world full of pain suffering, and wickedness, separated from God by sin. Then how can fellowship be restored with God? First we must be genuine about our own sins. Look at the 10 commandments and see how you stack up, it is a mirror showing us our sinful nature. God is perfectly holy and we have all broken his moral law and deserve his wrath and judgement.   The Gospel:   At the same time the Father is so rich in mercy and loves us so much that he sent his Son in the flesh 2000 years ago, who lived a sinless life on our behalf, was gruesomely tortured, nailed to the cross, and mocked by his own creation. He died a horrific death in place of US, and rose from the dead 3 days later proving he is the great I AM. He paid the fine for our death sentence on the cross thus satisfying the Father's justice and quenching his wrath, setting us free from sin and the Law. Once we realize our sinful nature,  we must repent for our sins, and then put our full trust in the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ like you'd put faith in a parachute. Do this and you will be born again. All your sins will be washed away and He will give you the Holy Spirit, who will live in you and sanctify your soul,  conforming you into the image of Christ. You'll have eternal life in a united heaven and earth, a new heart that loves righteousness, and relationship with God will be made right, not by our works or observance of the law, but by his AMAZING GRACE and mercy. You will be a new creature in Christ, that is His promise. This is all a free gift from God. Its up to you to receive or reject it. Humble yourself and ask him to reveal himself to you. Think about this, if you have a Bible I invite you to read the book of John. Jesus is the lover of your soul, and He will never let you down. Peace

The concept of buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off when the price rises just has the current market is down. Holding is profitable, although trading is far more profitable. I was to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but i was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market , all that changed when i encountered Daniel Wright services. , although i have been into numerous services but Daniel Wright stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favour . I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on trading but with the assistance of Daniel it was more easier to understand , Here are his details on Tel- gram ( @Danielwrightfx..

This is the best I can not believe he can be this close to so many ppl.

Damn azerrz u look so good my g
Dr. Doof sounded on point dawg
New intro :)
We need to embrace our flaws and insecurities and convert them into positive motives. Instead of letting them consume us and break us down until we destroy ourselves eternally and externally. It’s about building off of ideas as a community and helping one another when we struggle, not gaining materialistic value and ultimate power because we are presumed “Better” then the other. You don’t have to make everything perfect due to being pushed by societal standards. You can use those flaws and failures and make masterpieces, otherwise, you become static and robotic with no emotions or meaning of doing anything. You want to be know for being yourself not anyone else. I believe in you, stay motivated and keep grinding.
Official 21 savage beatbox lol
THANK U
Slapped. Straight slapped.
Every verse was fire, but Black Panther singing Welcome To The Party is on another level of greatness.

Hey azerrz I got an idea. Go on Omegle and try to copy other people’s voices as they speak. If it’s not possible reply it isn’t, if it is reply it is. Cya
2021 squad wya. Azerrz on top 🔝. oh yea join for support https://discord.gg/xWaYpzW7St
This just shows that if you are consistent with your talent and be yourself you succeed, Azzerz went from YouTube voice impressions to using a voice impression on a MOVIE!  This is an example of how far you can come, without trying to be like everybody else.  Love you Azzerz!!

Hey the end times are nere and I myself am coming out of my comfort zone by sharing the gospel to all possible so don't be afraid for the Bible says you may not enter the kingdom of heaven without works(sharing the gospel) for you may have faith but without works,faith means nothing Prayer:God I believe, I believe that Jesus died on the cross and on the third day rose again and ascended to heaven.Amen Lord I pray that the person reading this may be blessed with your word lord and I pray that they may one day ascend to heaven and live in eternal heaven with you.Amen
it's been a long time in the making, but i already know it's gonna be a banger
