I COOKED US UP A FEAST 🍳 also the Evening Swan pin is leaving my store in 2 days! grab him before he escapes (FOMO) https://crowdmade.com/collections/zanny
0:40 😂
3:54 a machine that makes particles go vroom vroom and then merge them
the sam raimi references are peak
I am a disloyal subscriber, now oil up ✋️😔✋️
23:10 kratos vs baldur ahh moment
18:38 footlocker, more like foot wall
You enjoyed ghost of despite it being the same thing, just because there are more things to do you still have to do them sevral times over, the more things to do just increase how many total times you have to do side stuff. There's variety  but you still repeat things.
6:49 context please😂
14:08  I wouldn't wanna fight me neither
The before you buy video got me 🤣
11:02 that so on point
“You sure? He’s got big teeth!”  Yeah Miles, he’s a giant Lizard. All of him is big.
16:46 endless cinema
The particle accelerator it’s just like a mini death star
The MJ missions in SM1 are more fun if you make it your sole objective to eradicate anything that moves.
that video title is crazy lmao love it
The Kraven Kravenoff joke made me laughing nonstop
This really soothed my adhd brain
"Statistically speaking, she's probably in danger" is insane. Does that mean, statistically speaking, Miles is doing bad shit right now?
3:54 It makes things go into hyperspace except everything inside it acts like Alderaan and goes kaboom.
I had a glitch happen to me where when Peter took off his mask when talking to Connor’s in his underground base Peter became invisible except for his head also it happened at the end of the game where Peter and miles are talking on the water tank
11:11 if you beat the game u can change the weather in the settings
Replayed the first game after SM2. Martin Li should not be apologized BY ANYBODY. Like how the fuck can the Spidermen just let him go. He killed random civilians in the street in cold blood. Like he had no reason and chose the most violent way to destroy the city and as much people he could. He did not even go for Osborne when he said its about Osborne. He just murdered random people 😂
When will game ans movie directors stop this bullshit. Your character yeets people of buildings, cruches their skulls and bodies. If he does not kill them. They are at least physically impaired. Stop acting like Spiderman cares if Yuri stabs some random goon.
FLASHBANG MAN
This game is the best game I have played
12:27 after all these years i've finally realized, Mr. Negative is a fucking Taken even his abilities look like its taken
Yaaay, We’re FREEEEeeee… 18:38
18:34 HE DUPLICATED!!😧😧😧
1:58 him zipping into the rocket is crazy
"I'm ready for the DLC insomniac."  Yeah, about that.....
Almost 2 years later and the 3 inches of me joke still gets me every time
1 year later and it still cracks me up 🤣
2:59.  Sorry to be that guy but...  his name is actually Sergei Kravenoff. 🤓
7:20 blame sweet baby inc
Double teaming the black one is wild 😂
The day-night cycle comes in the post game, like in the first.
“You’re a lizard harry” 😂😂😂😂
3:51 the holdo maneuver but with atoms
I think I know why the cops aren’t there during like the car chases. It’s cause in the first game crime indicators came from like the police towers. But since they have the app spider man is getting there before the police do.
8:05 I am pretty sure this still hasn’t been patched
18:57
so the end game of this is just web of shadows am i getting that correct
15:34
This is the most funniest Spider-Man gameplay I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
Venom did cūm 7:50
I think Oreo's power is dark magic.
Why doesn’t Peter just give Harry the Anti-Venom suit? He can control it at will now. Just hand it over and Harry can actually live and they can be the SpiderBros again
the joke, cave divers be like
"your a lizard harry" i cant😂
11:40 this comeback is crazy
at the start i heard AHH AHH and there was sticky white stuff every where
i need mj to die in spiderman 3. in spiderman 1aunt may died, miles morales phin dies, and in this game harry becomes a vegetable. mj must die
fun fact: marvel has so many characters with same initials of name and surnames. kraven kravinof, peter parker, miles morales, wade wilson, bruce banner.
awesome
The video is gold I wish I found out earlier 😊
Next game, the bosses carnage green goblin, probably both😂
Uooooba uooba
6:50 the fucking lotus insert bro im dead with these damn edits😂
a practical accelerator is death star that shoots atoms to smash into other atoms
0:45 its gonna be rough when you figure out that this is exactly what the other spiderman games did.   Actually, ALOT of things people complain about are issues in the other spidey games, but because the original 2 werent “woke” or something people dont complain.
Absolute cinema
bro what difficulty is he playing on to do THAT MUCH DAMAGE???
this guy is funnier than deadpool
0:34 thats like something that would happen in a lego movie😂
Particle accelerator: A convenient plot device for anything the writers couldn't bother to research or explain.
it's a reference to daredevil guys
the fps looks horrible
God this vid was so funny, just nonstop jokes
cave divers finding a crack in a brick wall to crawl through 18:34
the story was mid tier at best. The first game had grief and loss and pain...this one it feels like they tried to copy the same grief but they didn't know what caused that grief and sadness
Wait so am I the only one who thought the Hailey mission was actually cool? Because yeah I mean it's a much slower pace, but it's a really sweet and cool moment with you having to go through it deaf like Hailey. But you're still able to hear the vibrations of sound similar to how she feels them.
A particle accelerator is just a Death Star for nerds—but instead of blowing up planets, it yeets tiny particles at each other at nearly lightspeed to see what weird science magic happens.  💀 Step 1: Charge it up → Electromagnets = Sith Lightning. Particles start zooming. 🚀 Step 2: Hyperspeed go brrr → They get stupid fast, almost lightspeed, like a TIE Fighter on spice. 💥 Step 3: Crash ‘em → Boom. Reality breaks for a second. Scientists take notes.  Bonus: The Higgs boson is basically The Force—it gives mass to everything. No Higgs? No chonky space battles
12:50  Man that "tive-energy" fella must be a real trooper huh
14:08 "i don't want to me either"
USE UR SURGE ABILITY ITS HURTING TO LOOK AT IT
hilarious thing is all they need to do to save harry is just give him antivenom, it'll destroy his disease, thats what it does
Atleast in the marvel universe New York rent must be cheaper
4:57 sent me rolling💀
Give me the stealth and gadgets and old swinging back from miles remove the sky boost shit for peter but leave it for miles keep a few of the skills for the metal arms but remove the rest. And please for the love of god BRING BACK MJ FROM SPIDER-MAN 2018!! THIS NEW B*TCH LOOK LIKE A POTATO
Glad to see someone else showing love to Miles best suit. Last Stand suit is hands down the best.
1:45 i hate how effective that was at keeping my attention
wait black cat got a gf? NO WAY
18:57 Berserk eclipse scene be like 💀
The doctor while doing my colonoscopy 😂 21:15
I don’t care what anyone says, Peter built up a body count with that symbiote
Combat definitely does get stale after a while, I wish it was like that other game where one button press changes you between your regular suit and the symbiote suit with a totally different moveset, combos would be great in general but even better with that kind of system.
7:44 “I’m ready for the dlc insomniac” brother if you only knew
Well shit DareDevil is out in a few months
Ngl I absolutely destroyed peter in the venom fight as miles. Literally first tried and I just bullied him into submission
Okay I disagree with Billy miguire on the day and night cycle how do you expect them to make a cycle in the middle of the story? Some cutscenes happen at night and it needs to happen at night for the story try, Should the time just randomly change?
15:24 The way peter says “I can’t!” at the perfect time after Zanny says “Just jump down” is hilarious
Did anyone notice when MJ was getting 19 inches time of the video was also at 19:00
A particle accelerator in Star Wars terms : is like a blaster for tiny particles. It shoots particles, like protons or electrons, at super high speeds—almost as fast as a ship with a hyperdrive. Instead of firing at enemies, it makes these particles crash into each other, kind of like two starfighters in a space battle.  When they crash, they break apart into even tinier pieces, and scientists can study those pieces to learn how the universe works—like figuring out how the Force binds everything together. It’s not about destroying planets like the
Venom: grows wings Zanny: *doesn’t say “they fly now??”* Me: wait, that’s illegal.
PLEASE MAKE FUN OF IT. i I'm so desapointed. shouldve done my researches. the characters look like Sims on ps3. and the next gen techology was their excuse for changing the OG Peter. BULLSHIT. if its next gen they should look like ACTUAL humans.
And the Bull 4:06
Craven off and is brother jorkin off
Okay love this scene but where the hell did was this animation earlier in the season?!?
You can change the weather cicle in the settings
19:00 There’s actually no fucking way he timed that shit to be at the 19 minute mark of the video 😂
Can we all agree that the next game will prob be called Spider-man: The final chapter
Bro is playing the game so wrong if he jsut mashing square….
Man, I am so glad I wasn't the only one who felt the Adidas suit right before the final boss fight was a very, very weird addition.  While whether the suit is pretty or not is totally subjective, the Adidas thing slingshoted me out of the experience. HARD.
the particle accelerator in s wars terms is light saber but boom boom
gotta love the domestic abuse bossfight
7:41 Does he know? 😏
7:45 RIP in the chats for the DLC my guy.
The Spider-Man lotus reference 😭😭😭
We have slimecicle at home.
You… save him!!! 17:10 got me laughing so hard 😂😂😂
5:26 kill the dog, save the world
Watching the video 2º time cus like venom.  Spiders still arent bugs.
19:42 is wild 💀 “You’re about to feel three inches of meeee”
I only now finished the game having started it this year, zero bugs because it got patched pretty hard, very enjoyable but towards the end the combat gets stale af with all the square-button-mashing. Zanny's review could not have been more accurate (except the bugs parts which for me didn't happen). Still had a lot of fun tho
Symbiotes are weak to metalpipefalling.mp3
3-point spider combo
Zanny’s mentality is that when ever the guitar cover of the symbiot theme plays it automatically epic. And I agree with him🗣️🗣️🔥🔥
2:46 boom bitch
i see you thatonemayor
18:37  It was at that moment they met each other.
"Much like a genshin player" Reminded me of the time he got sponsored by genshin.
7:43 I’m sad now and zan must be too
17:04  Very poor choice of words bu- 💥
Honestly me personally spider man:miles morales was wayyyy better than
7:45 aged like milk
Martin Maria Wilson Linda Allen Scott
Played for 4 hrs (only Swinging catching pigeons) then lost my sh*t and uninstalled
18:37 your a wizard harry
16:17 that beat I can jam to
not taking the suit off was an option
bro tf u talking about, the mj boss fight and the boss fight u play as her were dope lol
Is it just me or does his laugh sound a bit like Lego Batman’s laugh from the movie, the theater scene
Drax: Why is kraven
The titel is just gold! Thank you for that giggle
Imagine a **particle accelerator** in **Star Wars** terms as a high-tech device similar to the way the Death Star’s **superlaser** works, but on a smaller, more controlled scale.  In the same way that the Death Star channels immense energy to fire a destructive beam, a **particle accelerator** speeds up tiny particles (like protons or electrons) to near lightspeed using **magnetic fields**. Once these particles are moving at high speeds, they collide, releasing massive amounts of energy or creating new particles, like how kyber crystals are harnessed for energy in the Star Wars universe.  Think of it like a **training ground for blaster bolts** — the particles are accelerated and directed in controlled paths, just as a Jedi might focus their lightsaber skills. Scientists use particle accelerators to explore the **fundamental forces** of the universe, much like a Jedi seeking to understand the **Force**. Instead of wielding lightsabers, scientists are “wielding” beams of energy in labs to study the smallest building blocks of reality.  In short, a particle accelerator is like a **Jedi weapon**, but for scientists — unlocking the secrets of the galaxy one high-speed collision at a time!
10:00 Jack Jackew Jackinoff
7:51, as soon as he said that I got a venom 3 trailer/add 🤣🤣
im gonne put some dirt in your eye😂
whats the music tht plays at 2:30
22:27 bro turned into Spawn
Miles vs peter felt like anakin vs obi won henoby
20:25
Zanny would make a great spiderman.😂
16:00 “I’m gonna put some dirt in your eye” Me: That’s not dirt Zanny
missed a golden oppurtunity to for a hells bells or for whom the bells toll moment
6:35 “You’ll look good too Miles.” Miles: Creates evolved suit
You are about to feel 3 inches of meat💀
0:19 can someone tell me which game it was on the right side of the screen?  Looks like a tower stacking type but with decent visuals.    The name Would be highly appreciated, thanks....
i love how they just made osborn donald trump
Flash bang man 🤣 got me cracking
18:53"atooo 19 inch long, HES GETTING IN....." BRUH😂😂😂😂
I’ve said It before and I will say it again, kraven’s power is being Russian.
they booed at miles because you know what
8:02 no way, he unlocked the secret tweaker suit😲
21:15 the boys s3e1
23:40 Chest Compressions. Chest Compressions. Chest Compressions.
Particle execrator in star wars terms: making a loop out of those weird ball locks Cere had in Jedi survivor to smash two wrist rockets together to make stuff
What was the first assassins creed mobile game called
lol the flashbang man appeared for me too
Spiders aren't bugs.  There you go.
this game is good, would have been better if Carnage wasn't a future DLC & if there wasn't about 200 side LGBTQR2D2+++ quest bullshit fuck y'all woke devs --' that and the 1000+ tutorial like "TO SWING YOU HAVE TO PRESS R2"  even tho you have like 20-30 hours playing the damn game....
NOOOO MJ! 18:58
bro i waited two days to beat scream and my older brother took the controller and deafeated her btw he didnt play the game before
Good.  Not as good as the first one.
Imagine a particle accelerator as a high-tech "hyperspace tunnel" for tiny particles like protons or electrons.  Just as Han Solo's Millennium Falcon uses hyperspace to travel vast distances in a short time, a particle accelerator propels particles to nearly the speed of light, allowing them to travel a long way in a very short time.  Instead of navigating through asteroid fields or Imperial TIE fighters, particles in an accelerator zip through a vacuum tube, guided by powerful magnetic fields, like the Falcon navigating through hyperspace lanes.  At the end of the journey, these accelerated particles collide with a target material, releasing valuable data, much like the Falcon emerging from hyperspace with crucial information for the Rebel Alliance - chat gpt
Not even 30 seconds in and I’m already laughing
What if venom grew wings because in the lab where Harry became venom there was green gas that looked like the green goblin gas so venom nixie with the goblin gas giving him wings
Thank you, I don't remember when I last laughed so hard.
The absolute ROAST in the end
The best thing about the last miles suit is that earlier on he says “spider-man doesn’t do sponsorships”
"Your a lizard, Harry" *fucking dies*
1:23 L racism
The spiderman Lotus bit was gold😂😂😂😂😂
is he playing performance or fidelity mode?
18:33 “woah that was weird. Well time for my afternoon walk.”
Ye I do got a joke for dat one he saw too much in 0.00000000000000.00000000000000000001 milliseconds that he left
Mr. Negative AKA Oreo Man Is Mr. Positive now
Racist McGuire for symbiote. It’s been 5 months but thoughts?
Oreo has the ability to change his form between a normal human, and his negative-energy body. In that body, he can control and emit black light and the kind of electrical energy used in photograph negatives.
should've added the bear joke that peter did
A particle accelerator is the thing that help barry allen get his powers in The Flash series
16:46 “Hit Confirmed” got me crying 😭
The game can have some combos but mostly in aerial combat and even that still isnt enough to be fun  The game also made one of the more expandable and interesting game mechanics of a parry be the most boring part of the game which I must say is only a thing insominiac could do
MJ is the real hero of Spiderman 2. We want her dlc
Was the kkk joke meant to be there with the kraven krathew kravonov
“You’re free to go…TO HELL!”  - Bully Zanmaguire
3:26 “TO HELL” bro is bully maguire himself
wait why didnt Peter leave a little bit of venom inside harry then they could have gotten Mr. Negative to purify the venom- DUMBASS
always watching
12:37 "He's so annoying, GET OUT OF THERE"
Absolute banger 🔥 😎
I understand the complaints with Mile’s new suit, I have my own as well. But I do like the design of it. Particularly the sneakers and the blue lines across the suit (which kinda reflects his new blue lightning). I am a sucker for that neon type stuff.
It's look like that in the next game you are going to fight an god slayer
Bro when zanny was fighting Peter and Peter got stuck on the tree and he said just climb down and then Peter said I can’t
It bugs me that Spiderman 2 doesn’t have a day/night weather thing in the open world GTA San Andreas did it 19 years ago and this game can’t??
16:10 ... need i say anything?
Vid one of asking zanny to play shadow of war
Since you enjoyed playing as vemom, i think you should try playing ultimate spider man from 2005
Games finished now and it's even greater.....mj is hot in this game🤤and the side content is great and idk if you're joking or not but your criticism isn't great for this game
What is his outro song
A particle accelerator is a machine that accelerates particles.
Dude kravniof is his name his henchmen call him raven.
19:08 zannys so real for that
5:29
1:17 I can’t tell if that’s a race joke or not because the police were booing miles when he was swinging by, but at the same time zanny was criticizing the game. Can someone tell me which one it is?
A Particle accelerator in Star Wars terms: Imagine a Rebel Pilot on a Kamikaze mission to destroy the Death Star. He keeps spinning around the death star, using its gravity to increase his speed every rotation till he is almost lightspeed. He is doing this so that when he does hit the Star, it gets destroyed completely. The Pilot is the particle, the Star's gravity acts as the accelerator
are we gonna act like mj saying 'were a team' is the same as iris saying 'we are the flash'
18:37 When dobby stops you from entering platform 9 and 3/4s prematurely
Spider-man 2 new game +
6:27  "Stings doesn't it?"  Sir her whole body is literally burning in ashes
Do you want to save MJ though ? i don't.
17:38 Guest appearance from me
Where's the Kirin break?
dude the cops cheering for peter and shitting on miles is hilarious
12:36 his powers negativity
Lee's power is bad vibes
0:10 I love this joke
Only TRASHBOX players
8:02 I had something like that happen to me once, too. Except instead of a walking flash bang, I was a cube. 💀
Okay but can we talk about venoms wings… my jaw physically dropped at how majestic that was.
Hey guys we’re here to look for signs of Harry “no sign of Harry” fuck😂😂
😯Venom with wings? Ok that is cool even for a villain...from a distance of course
Now people may like this anti venom spider man, but to me… he looks like he has cu*. Yeah I don’t like the cum suit, normal venom suit is much better.
by the lots of Green Goblin references you should try my Norman saves the day MOD V2(? (spidey 1 movie game mod)
Why tf was there a slip from an assassins creed mobile game😂😂
The best thing zanny does is make a venom section of the video... Because he knows what we're here to rewatch
something about the city crimes in this game, was hoping they'd be more varied this time around. But they've somehow made them less fun than the first game's. The Miles game also had more interesting small crimes. I would boot up both games long after their releases just to swing around and stop the petty crimes.    I was just hoping there would be way more variety, I had dreams of lesser known supervillains showing up in very rare city crimes (not full side quests). Imagine chasing Big Wheel or Stilt Man through the streets, stopping Beetle or Boomerang from robbing a bank, tracking Vermin or Iguana through the sewers.   Spider-Man's rogues gallery is so vast and is full of these quirky small-time super villains that they could REALLY take advantage of. Swarm, Alistair Smythe (Spider-Slayer), Crime Master, Jackal, Spot and more. I don't think all of them would work for what I had in mind, but there's so much potential there!
3:13 lowkey I kinda needed the tips at first cuz it was my first time playing a Spider-Man game 😅 but then it kinda did start to get annoying so I see your point
10:11
He used Final Cut to edit don’t ask me how I know
No, it is not lazy. Just check how much games Insomniac releases. It's almost like they have to carry the whole ps5 brand by themselves.
IVE HAD HEADLESS HAMELTON
I wish you included a segment where you talked about your overall thoughts about the story. I'm left with questions about how you feel about certain arcs in the game. The video was funny at least but I'm left wondering about a lot.
😂😂😂😂
3:54 a blaster only has a short space to make a blaster bolt and speed it up, right? it is a pipe with a hole in the end. imagine if you made it a circular tube. the blaster bolt would fly around, getting faster and faster, until it slams into another blaster bolt and showing us how the force works.
11:42 Damn 😭
I really hope for the next game they rework the combat, it really does get super dry pressing the same like 2 buttons all the time. Also i felt like the story had too much going on, but I guess that’s just the struggle of having 2 MCs and not wanting to neglect one (which didn’t even work tbh miles felt underutilized)
15:47 now I can't stop imagining a nightmare symbiote rotation
Can someone release a full version of zanny 's outro it so good
i'm playing Miles Morales rn and your negative points about the game are the same in Miles game, but you liked it.... 🤷‍♂
21:24 lmaoo
21:24 lmaoo downloading move set
20:00 just like in real life right xd
20:00 just like in real life right xd            jk
19:20
7:52 lmaoo
14:33 Pervy???
4:14 Normally I'm the "Peter stop, this isn't you!" kind of guy But now I'm the "villain broken by MC's mistakes" kind of guy
took me until today to understand the Daredevil joke
Spider-Man: They Can Fly Now
Wait my daredevil joke makes no sense 😂😂😂😂😂
21:28 me as a sperm fighting the Plan B my mother took
7:55 I thought that bug was exclusive to your game but it showed up in mine too.
18:37 minor inconvenience
I actually looked through settings and I think the glowing thing is an intended feature as a visual aid to act as an accessibility feature you can toggle, this game is cool like that. Unfortunately the game is pretty bugged and the values in the settings seem to get messed up (perhaps an integer overflow from some part of the code not working as intended if I had to guess) which is unfortunate and will hopefully get fixed in an update
I love Spider-Man. But Venom is king🤘🏻
The Hogwarts Legacy music over the Hailey mission got me dead
When are you playing hifi rush?
"The spider is stronger than the bear"  God of war Ragnarök: Sureeee
I finally 100% the game and boy was I happy to pay respects to Aunt May as spider cube for the final trophy before the platinum
i don't care what you say i want to see mysterio in the next game
i'm glad i wasn't the only one struggling with the dodges and parries 😂 thought i was a noob that would've left the Zan Man dissapointed
11:41 well that escalated quickly...
It sucks to say but, in the past, the games had a LOT more love and care into them. Quality. Nowadays, everyone is realizing how far they can get on empty promises and laziness. Even good studios are slowly falling off due to all this. Insomniac taking over for Spider-Man was, and is, huge, but it does suck that Spider-Man 2 didn't HIT as good as it could've.  Also, wtf was Miles' last suit? Huge letdown! XD
How is spider man losing to some lady with only police training😭💀💀💀
People actually buy your merch?💀
A particle accelerator is like a starship rocket that sends particle a awesome speeds
Bro, a side mission where you played as a blind dude would be absolutely fucking hilarious
1:26 no it's for diversity
I actually liked the side mission more that the first one
And chameleon is in there
Did you know there’s a spider verse reference in the game 8:50
Venom drenches MJ in his alien juices, and she falls under his sway. "Did I just get cucked by Venom!?"
Civilians to the foot in the wall :”well they had a good night”
A x-wing is in the trenches of the Death Star and gets a boost every 10 seconds until light Speed than a growgo is dropped on the x-wing fusing them together..
0:54 i think zanny would like the yakuza games for this since they have so many moves you can do.
I just noticed u can hear ur guys spine crack when peter throws him off the car
21:32 every American
19:06: we’re in the same boat there zanny
That hand holding with the hints was extremely annoying
It’s cool that it’s not just venom in the game but it’s scream also
Mister negative can control the negative energy in his body  to produce projectile blasts and fly
zanny can i have your ps5 please
24:02 *OH GOD HES WRITING A FAN FIC WE'RE ALL DOMMED*
i love how the police cheered when peter passed through the police department but booed when miles passed .
The amount of comic symbiote fanservice is amazing. Bringing in lesser known symbiotes (If you don't read that is).
8:03 I got the exact same glitch in that mission. Only know it isn't supposed to happen because my little brother didn't get it and neither did most people
Me be like when he said your “your about to feel 3 inches of me” I was like AYO
Bro boss fights were so fun in this game. They literally tried to make a souls like
Turns out the unofficial title to this game is: Spider-Mid Web of Shadows at Home
8:52: almost choked on my drink!
Game of the year joke hit hard after Game of the year result. 😂
Funny boi becomes angry boi basically Spider-Man 2
5:08 is that metal gear rising reference?
3:22 😂
3:46 watch the flash and you will know
hey spider man 2, on a scale of 2 zannys, how excited are you about zanny man 2?
23:13 He just got some black goo on him and that's how you treat your best friend huh?
19:35 Now now keep it low MJ, we can talk about it inside. I already know how Venom feels so the software is still in the system aight? Don't activate it.  Okay yea, that's kinda like the Hulk now I think about it
13:07 so the symbiote basically made Peter a sigma male
bro made me laugh when the guy did a parry attack and he just did a venom punch yelling bitch caught me off guard tbh
It isn’t all pressing square, if you looked at skills you would see options for combos
1:02 I see he just wants sword game again 😂
Bro skipped the entire kraven bossfight☠️
A, for the algorithm!
rlly thought peter was gonna call miles a slave or sum
Cooked with this one but when are you going to play an batman arkham game. Maybe batman arkham knight  ?
There are combos zanny you are just not using them
The reason there isn't a day night cycle is because the devs want certain story points to happen at certain times of day for atmosphere.
Do metal gear rising
As soon as I saw the scene where peter falls on his back I knew Zanny would make the „My Back“ joke about it
I have a love/hate relationship with this game, for some reason it feels rushed and all over the place unlike the first one which was a blast
The game, for as good as it is, is made better by the Devs overlooking some shit. 🤣
“spider-man doesn’t kill”  *insomniac black suit peter* 👀
i love this whole symbiotic critic thing u got going for this video. while also showing that u love it💀 i’m subscribing lol
i agree with sym sm so much all these superhero games now are just mashing 1 button and counter with the other we want some movesets that we can do otherwise the game was awesome
I really thought they would’ve listened to the feedback from the MJ/Miles missions from the first game but nope. 😂 Also combat is fun you’re just not making use of all the moves and stuff ✌🏻😅
About Question what is "Particle Accelerator in Star Wars Terminology": The particle accelerator operates like a tool that amplifies the strength and abilities of subatomic particles, much like Jedi training enhances the Force. It functions as a sort of "power school" for particles, propelling them to high energies for in-depth exploration. Similar to the Force, the accelerator harnesses specialized energy fields, and its applications extend to delving into the fundamental aspects of matter and grasping the universal forces within the galaxy. Essentially, it serves as a scientific instrument for researchers to decipher the fundamental components of matter and energy in the Star Wars universe, paralleling how Jedi utilize the Force to understand and manipulate reality.
Scream Is Hot af
There are no cops because hamerhead fcking killed them all
Zanny is the only creator that makes us shit our selves laughing period
lmao It's impossible to be an unemployed genshin player. Do you know how expensive those waifus are?!
11:02 Zanny makes up better dialogue than the writers
Zanny: don’t worry you look good too miles Foreshadowing his terrible suit later
Impossible.
bad
it feels like as i watch this everything in the world is becoming a 'video game object' but also trying to get the player to take it seriously... idk it looked cooler in something like shattered dimensions
Zanny, brother, in the setting you can lower the hints
18:38 Something strange is a foot   I'm so sorry
3:48 deathstar in a tube
amazing comentary zanny
if the mobile game attention span stuff isnt ironic im unsubbing
I finished Spiderman 2 before zanny did
4:04
Dude I just wanna say I remember the for honor days when you had like 700,000 subs just realized how much you’ve grown. Whilst I still miss the for honor gameplay it’s nice to see you play other stuff especially Star Wars.
7:53 bro became the spot 💀💀
The cutaways are hilarious haha
That one For Honor player belike 3:30-3:39
13:53😂 PAUSE!!!!!!
couldn't peter give him the Anti-Venom suit? no? eh, what ev still a pretty decent game.
Dark souls changes people 😂
I have a dearest request for you, Zanny! One game that you may think is not good, but a challenge anyway! That being The walking dead definitive collection! You do it, and you will be the true king of the Evening Swan, the worthy of the basket helmet, the best dog owner yet!
1:46 “to much shit is on my screen”
PLEASE make a ghost of Tsushima legends playthrough
I think I have you added on Xbox
Battle front 2
Play lethal company :D
Ngl, most mid recent spiderman so far.  Of course if you enjoy it then you enjoy it and I wont take that away from you
21:15 Ant-man vs Thanos
Zany, play Like a Dragon Gaiden, you’ll thank me later
Lets force zanny to play spider man web of shadows
he can copy himself right he could theoretically leave a copy holding the timelines if he gets bored or wants to go do whatever and then come  back
BRILLIANT, BUT LAZY
Miles was cooking in the end bro
When Witcher 3?
22:18 completely missed opportunity to say "They fly now!?"
no puppy break :(
Can you play horizon zero dawn
play lethal company
why does this have 7 likes?
Yep you still suck, and lack any comedic timing.
Anhone else get caught off guard by "Oo-baahhh"
Zanny they got rid of reflex guard get on for honor
I think it could even get away with dmc-like combat if they wanna keep the one button
zanny my boi
Yeah I love this game, but I do see a bit of the Kingdom Hearts game play issue. You have plenty of options, but what's the point if mashing one button is just as effective? However, I recommend trying the Ultimate difficulty. Certain enemies break out of your button mashing frequently. Made me have to string genuine combos together.
The amount of times I paused and entered photo mode in this game is unreal
They should've had some more things in between, like a break from venom story line after peter gets it off, maybe introducing gwen and eddie and some other spidey stuff with peter. And then at the end jump back into Venom shenanigans. It would've made this spiderman story worth it and complete
We’re the hell were the avengers during the whole symbiotic invasion.
Forget Star Wars' terms. Here it is in "Science For Dummies" terms: machine makes really small bits go really fast and then bump into each other so the nerds can observe that and write really smart papers about the results so they can justify those government grants that keep them fed.
Zanny please play sea of thieves it 10/10 monkey approved
zanny are you play baldur's gate 3?
5:35 is that Blind Al? Does this mean we’ll see Deadpool here?
18:39 guy got punched into the backrooms
The only thing i want in the next game is rdj as iron man to mentor peter and it would be game of the year
20:24
You scream like a girl.
Zanny will you play the mw2023? I really want  to see your reaction to that game WAHAHAH
19:38 , my back🤣😭
What theme is that during the venom segment?
Say what you want about spider man but I swear to god if you make fun of the venom thing which it is like the stasis subclass in destiny 2
Zanny… Battlefront - HEAR ME OUT DONT SCROLL BRO Battlefront 2015 I mean I’m sure that shits dead as hell but it’s worth a shot or maybe some time on a live stream
Zanny, Real talk, I think Respawn is making Jedi Survivor based off you in a few ways, for starters leaving the poncho in the game, and making the first cosmetic option of it the pink poncho, and some other things, but I have a theory, they are so going to make it so that in the third game you are going to get to fight Darth Maul.
Particle accelerator in star wars terms: think podracing but the there are two pods going in opposite directions on the course and the goal is to make the pods hit eachother, now replace pods with atoms.
YO I JUST GOT THE JOKE AT 1:17 IM DYING 🤣
easiest 100% ive done
I literally played as a fucking white little cube once💀
Damn i feel for all you who when through bugs during peek moments. all i ever got was Spider-Cube
i had that same glowing suit bug lmao
BRO WHO LET MILES COOK BRO GET HIM AWAY FROM THE STOVE
cum symbiote???????
btw can you do monster hunter rise next 🙏
Zanny talks about original meaningful content but ends up enjoying the 10-year-old eldering fighting style.
Zanny can you play returnal please
What are the chances of Zanny and the gang doing a Baldur's Gate 3 run. Tell me that wouldn't be absolute gold
16:33 hits way too hard with the black suit theme
2K Lego driving you should try
why does miles look like a colgate toothpaste with the evolved suit
4:22 and this is why I don't buy open world games anymore. Huge time sync, 60 hours of boring side content for every 15 minutes of brilliant storytelling.
23:40 now give him the anti suit and there’ll be no harm.
Zanny cut the bear honey joke for his mid overused jokes. Cringe
Who’s buying zanny’s merch
what if he said "we..... are....... h0rny!"
bro that hogwarts legacy music caught me tf off guard  givin me flashbacks to merlin trials 💀
Cannot believe he said the starwars game but not devil may cry
Hey Zanny you should do a video of you playing the entire Five Nights at Freddy's Trilogy😂
Watch Mr.Freeze come out next episode so the devs prove you wrong!
We need to get symbiote Zanny to decide whether to finally kill or save Jin’s uncle.
I have your dogs captured if you want to see them again play for honour 😊
this vid is pure gold i love you zanny
Venom on the bike had me laughing for at least 10 minutes
comic book accurate venom wings lets goooooooooo
Ayyy
19:47 metal pipe sound effect:
Instead of saying “I lied” you should’ve put the force unleashed Vader clip. You clearly don’t know what you’re doing and you’re a failure of a Star Wars youtuber. Just delete your account at this point honestly
did you see the gaming wins reference?
Zanny, please bro, PLEASE play Alan wake 2, I will donate my children to your charity of choice if you do
i just want zanny to play the arkham series
11:06 Whats wrong with her face, is this a bug??
Need to see Zanny play Devil May Cry
18:33 bro punched him so hard he phased through a wall
Zanny should play Vampyr. it's kinda like a souls game combat wise but it's not as strict
zanny can you try just cause 3 pls?
where were the avengers during all of this?
Anyone think peter was like anakin in this game, from good to bad then back to good, anyone else or is it just me?
18:32 Another prick in the wall. 🧱
11:57 😂😂😂😂
I personally want more Spider-Man  2 content ❤❤
Bro, Kravens real name is not Kraven Kravinoff, its Sergei Kravinoff
As a German, I've never heard someone butcher the pronunciation of "Addidas" this bad before :D
Whats the amazing edit of the symbiote suit at 16:33? I love that version of the song
no dog break :(
18:55 to 19:01 😂😂
Came back here after gaming wins made a zanny reference TWICE in his Everything great about spider-man 2.
@theonlyzanny Particle accelerator (actual edition): So if you’ve ever messed with magnets to push and pull things and then tried to make two opposing ones touch, it’s like that. We basically put a bunch of electric-powered magnets in a circle so that the different particles, which are essentially magnetic, speed up and get steered along a path until they go so fast the two particles which are so tiny they’d almost never hit and which act like two repelling magnets (sort of) hit each other. Then, because science is weird, they spit out different bits of energy as well as new weirder particles. Then we measure the new particles and the energy (how much, what type, etc.) and combine it with some math to try and figure out what’s going on down there. If you saw the quantum realm in marvel it’s literally that size. Even though the movie is inaccurate a lot of ways, it gets to just how weird stuff that small is compared to normal life. But basically we use the accelerator to test our theories and make sure the math is matching as well as to try and explain gaps in knowledge or find new things that don’t exist that could explain more of how the building blocks of reality work, which tends to them have effects for tech, chemistry and chemical stuff, as well as astronomy and all that. More than anything though, they’re giant expensive intricate tools that do stuff that’s basically impossible, so we love to nerd out about them. Love the videos keep it up bro.
It’s weird, I’ve seen a lot of bug complaints and obviously seen some, in this video and elsewhere, but the only bug I noticed the entire time was after I beat the game, some of the crime events that pop up would disappear when I got in range to trigger them. At this point it wasn’t really an issue because I’m done with the game until new game + or dlc or whatever
Zanny, not sure if you watch but the channel "Gaming wins" refrenced you twice in his Spider-Man 2 video.
Zanny, when you gonna review the new fortnite!? 🤔
ZANNY PLS CAN U PLAY HORIZON FORBIDDEN WEST ITS A VERY GOOD COMBAT GAME THERES A GRAPPLE THINGY AND YOU CAN FLY AND IT HAS LIKE- *MACHINES* THAT YOU CAN FIGHT JUST PLS PLAY IT
Final scene in the fight with the combo between the two spidermans and it has a square on the right side of the screen and wants you to mash it. 23:08
This is gay of the year
GamingWins did THE WHO AM I MEME
The fact that the MJ boss fight has more phases than the Kraven boss fight is ridiculous.
Play web of shadows that has the combat that you want and interesting swinging tricks that is a bit specialised but it is fun Man you managed to condense the entire second half into 24 minutes! That is crazy impressive!
I’m guessing they removed the cops from the game because of all the ACAB people. There was some company called Sweet Baby Inc, which is a diversity and inclusion consultant, and they worked on this game. They were probably responsible for the deaf girl mission, MJ’s looks being nerfed, Black Cat getting a girlfriend, and the decision to have Miles replace Peter as the main Spiderman. Wokeness strikes once again.
If you want a game with amazing combos, play some Devil May Cry, you won’t regret it.
Miles game: has roughly the same mechanics and game play as the first game. Zanny: slightly better than the first game. Spider-Man 2: has roughly the same mechanics as the first game. Zanny: Lazy
play deltarune
It does have its post game problems but it’s waaaaaayyyyyt better then Starfield
Give that man the ability to hevy on red
Hey Zani, who’s your favorite Spider-Man?
Yo zanny you gotta try battlebit
The combat is much better with the air combos, there's plenty of different things you can do especially if you advance through the joint skill tree
So damn funny lol. One of ur best video's hands down
batman arkham series when??
Peter looks younger than miles for god's sake whu couldnt they keep the original one
Areufilipino
I understand what you're saying about the repetitive side missions and stuff like that. But the way the story is and the transitions, they likely spent most of their time on them and the animations. And the Venom mission. The other two games were mostly the same when it comes to waves and stuff to when they make a third game because I believe they will. The side missions and like hoards of enemies likely won't change much.
The more I watch this game the more I realize that I got lucky when playing the game. A few people I've watched have experienced glitches 28 hours put in the first week and 100% the overall map and the story I didn't experience a single one I thought they weren't even in the game. But like I said I must have just got lucky.
How are de dogs Zan man? Haven’t seen em in a second
Peter lost Aunt May but got Aunt Mary now 😄 Edit:- Venom Spidey is the best. Doesn't take any Sh!t from anyone
7:01
When you gonna post siege
cool
it's really noticable how much better your vids have gotten in the past year
In for honor terms... a particular accelerator, i think🤔 is orochi light spamming so fast the only thing keeping you alive is Invinciblity frames
i like zanny content but i feel like he hates because its what gets views.
Alan wake 2? Your take on it would be crazy :D
Zanny your goated man😂
Spider-man 2, God of War 5 >>>>> any game from the last 5 years 💯
Time for a square button rebuild
I want a full stream of zanny playing the game
'Its not a bug its a BETHESDA reference' - zany
19:44 “you’re about to feel 3 inches of me” 💀💀
Day whatever the hell of asking zany to play ancestors humankind odyssey please man I want my family back
Green face reveal looking ass💀💀
I'm so glad I wasn't the only person who came when I realized Venom was playable
Is this police in the room with us right now, Spider-man 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I had a way better time watching your videos than finishing the game thank you as always  for the great content
no dog time??
Love that zanny doesnt meat ride and is honest
LMAOO THE MOMENT HE ATE KRAVEN YOU WERE DEAD SILENT
YouTuber named danger:
"Just get down spider man"  "I--- CAN'T---"
Pls play squad galactic contention mod its basically bf 3
I honestly lost the will to finish the game...
there are combos in the game that make you do different things
Damn didnt know spider man 2 was web of shadow 2
1:59 lies of Spider
I love the title 😂 glad someone else realised how undercooked the game is
The combat is one of the standout things about these Spider-Man games, I have no idea how you were doing it by only pressing square.
here's a better version of the particle accelerator explanation. basically, you take two objects and accelerate them to warp speed then make them hit each other, and it makes really crazy stuff that you can study that you wouldn't find anywhere else.
i hate the fact that every time you put a shitty mobile game on the side of the video i instinctively watch it
You missed out the best dialog in the game, before you fight the bear brute with the axe
Spider-Man 3 did a better job articulating Peters relationship with the symbiote and they way it affects him than the game did, but the game did a better job doing Venom than the movie.
zanny, particle accelarator is like the thing in the flash tv series. It was the one that when flash run fast enough and the other side releases nitrgoen or some chemical that allows him to break the barriers of time and which allowed him to go back in time to watch his mum die. First season
You managed to make me laugh out loud twice before the halfway point you're hilarious man keep it up
0:14 belligol
Is no one talking about the assassin creed game that just popped in? No okay
rajang when?
“He flys now”
He flys now
18:59 zanny : “19 inches she’s getting it” bro what🤣🤣🤣🤣 19:43  to MJ :you are about to feel 3 inches of me  This is why I love zanny 🤣🤣🤣🤣
17:40 And here I thought that one hugging scene in his last video couldn't look more cursed
Zanny I think alot of people, especially me, would love a Sam Raimi trilogy reaction vid
I feel like it’s getting stale yes. Still an amazing game but please, can we not get another freakin Spider-Man game. Give literally any other hero a game on this level
I’m Kravenough 😢
1:20 had me in tears 😂😂😂 Daredevil reference I'm dead 😂
There is another end credit scene btw *cough cough*
Bad vid
Zanny u the man. Luv u. Hope you good. Look at how much u've grown. Checking  on the mil watches. Proud of you man. Love you.
7:15
Fire Fire
There is no game of the year. Im not even joking at this point. I got my 20 years of gaming done i started on crash bandicoot and moved on to metal gear and everything that was great and bad since 1991. Games have gone to the dogs.
"Wait I can't hear anything" He says as he's playing from the perspective of a deaf person
Your complains about the square button can literally be said for every other game with combat😂👎
Bro I had those minibosses locked in such nasty corner combos I almost felt bad for them not getting a single hit😂
Love the vids but idk what you talking about mashing square, no offense but you gotta be pretty bad to just only mash square. I can swing enemies into the wall back and forth and then slam them into the ground without even using square.
Why wasn't MJ's symbiote named carnage? She looks like carnage or called the Stbiote Queen like from Ult8mate spiderman?
Kraven The Pervy-Hunter, is actually Pervy the Purge-Trooper from another multiverse.
I appreciate that Zanny is honest about how he feels about the games he plays. This game was fun and definitely a really good time but holy moly was it buggy. Easily the most cursed PS exclusive I have played and I played Days Gone on launch lol.
i didnt really have any bugs until the final mission when im playing as Miles fighting Venom i turned into a frigging white box! the whole last few cuts scenes i was just a white box and then worse, MJ turned invisible so it kinda ruined the whole last part of the games story for me
MJ is a reason why some devs shouldn't self insert themselves into games/shows, the woman who did it was meh
Complains about mashing square, plays souls like games
The game is fuxking amazing
"Accelerates particles, a particle accelerator does." - Yoda I got heavy Street Fighter (live action movie) vibes from that Fido part. Also, I didn't really care for this game...and I fully suspect a spider-mobile in the next one; the first game went hard on Arkham archetype; this one went even further. And yet Batman was vastly better. To me, at least. Lost my shit on the Bethesda joke. Freaking hilarious.
I need the devs to add the symbiote set to the sam r.😢 black spider man suit.
That's funny, because spiderman 2 made me finish
Particle accelerator: haha particle go brrrr
To be honest, if the critics in this video aren't a joke then I have to say the following: if you really think, that the gameplay is only smashing  square, then you play it wrong. I'm sorry
If you want in depth gameplay and challenge then may I suggest the Devil May Cry series
You have to play the new cod Marina voice actor is in it yes The one from Star Wars
*jumps over kravens heavy attack* zanny: UR WEAK, PATHETIC
Dream face reveal looking ahh😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
it’s a spider-man game
A partical exelarator in star wars terms is the thing that is on the back of the star destroyer but on a small one
I hope they imrpove the combat in the third game i definitely agree that it feels like a square mashing simulator they should add back that combo you could do in the Miles game where after to send an enemy flying back you hold triangle and then miles pulls him back to kick the guy in the face
Particle Accelerator: What charges the death star but you're not allowed to shoot it
Im suprised zanny didn't say when venom got wings they fly now
12:52 pffffft… oh no that bully is being mean (negative) ima get hurt by it. I forgot what I was thinking originally.
12:13 I swear I’m not crazy, it looks like one of the old Arkham games.
11:16 fun fact: around maybe 20 possibly more 15 yrs ago games had some of that, heck Kingdoms of Amalur had it on og release.
5:28/30 an unfortunate probability, but ima hope the word “antho” ain’t in there.
The Episode III star wars game was epic!
4:56 pffft… *sword game* combos.
3:54 railgun… ‘s barrel, particle… projectile, heh what’s the difference. I’m not a terrorist, nor an ad creator.
Wow.
Peter is a webbon of mass destruction
7:20 it's because they defunded the police
A particle accelerator makes 2 beams of particles, like electrons or protons, move through a pipe faster and faster until they reach near lightspeed (but 2 beams moving in opposite direction), then we make the beams collide and collect data on the resulting "explosion." The trajectories and energies of the particles released and captured after the explosion can tell us all sorts of information about the original particles that we normally could not directly measure.  STAR WARS TERMS: A Jedi and a Sith force push their own rock at each other from far away, faster and faster, until the rocks collide and shatter. The scattering pattern of the debris (where did the most/the least amount of fragments go and how fast?) can tell you the relative strengths of the Jedi and Sith.
the antivenom suit also awful, just like milky white glossy
Spider-Man: **Destroys half the city** Everyone: Thank you Spider-Man! We're saved! Spider-Man: **Destroys half the city but in the Symbiote suit** Everyone: What the heck Spider-Man? This isn't ok!
In Star Wars terms, a particle accelerator could be likened to the "hyperspace jump drive." Just as a particle accelerator in our world accelerates subatomic particles to incredibly high speeds and energies, a hyperspace jump drive in the Star Wars universe propels a starship into the alternate dimension of hyperspace, enabling faster-than-light travel. Both technologies involve manipulating fundamental elements to achieve extraordinary effects: in one case, understanding and harnessing subatomic particles, and in the other, navigating through a separate dimension to cover vast interstellar distances in a short time.
actual valid criticisms 👌❤
9:09 "he doesn't even look sick..." *walks off using a cane*
Harry: " That'd be like using a shotgun for a haircut" Me: "yoo nirvana reference 🔥"
5:03 the toddler vs pitbull joke was wild 💀🤣
Well. It's a current gen sony game. So it has to work for all kinds of stupid. The writing also was done with the help of sweet baby inc. Who ofc hate cops. Thats why there are no cops there since all cops are evil.
Sad day for spidey fans. Miles used all his powers and skill to get a sponsorship from Adidas.
18:55 i love how fans made Venom giving the D to MJ on tiktok
I love how the Scream boss is just couple's therapy
Seeing miles and “Fido” now I need to see zanny play mgr revengeance
A particle accelerator in star wars terms, is like the force. It can do anything needed for the plot.
This is like the 4th time watching this because I keep getting distracted before I get to the end. I've only just figured out the Swinging past the Police building joke 😅
Abrupt ending with no summary or afterthoughts, i agree completely.
dog break?
Hey zanny can you try the yakuza series or the judgement because the combat is phenomenal in my opinion
09:18 "You're a lizard, Harry" LMFAOOOO
Zanny needs to play a Yakuza game
Did you actually like the game tho zanny
When I first heard you make the dare devil joke I didn’t think much of the fact how it didn’t make sense until you pointed it out and it made the joke so much better.
Great video damn
The "no combos" talk just made me realise Zanny hasn't played the game that objectively does them the best, the DMC series. This is an absolute crime.
I purposefully made the MJ missions fun by figuring out she has a dodge and you don't have to stealth I mean the dodge has tiny eyeframes and horrendous recovery but it was fun to weave and take out every hunter while there all chasing me
Bro 20:26 sounded too perfect
anti-venom and superior spider man suits, very based
Spider-man a flashlight 😂😂
“Maybe the ps5 can’t do a day and night cycle” says the man who put hours into ghost of Tsushima
I will forever stand by the theory that everything zanny says while playing games is just what the characters is thinking in their head.
Babe wake up zanny uploaded
“If this game wasn’t rated Teen you’d be dead rn” Next scene, “Kraven, Kraven, Kraven” *No comment*
18:03 "Let him get up, let him get up."
If this game doesn't win game of the year, I dunno what will.
14:47 "don't say it Pete!" i am dying!!!!
I think for the third game, Norman is going to take the goblin formula and become the green goblin. Doc Ock  Could  Return possibly and Cletus Kassidy will be Carnage
Venom with Giant Bat Demon Wings is Metal A F
When Zanny started playing as venom I honestly thought he was going to start to  Rap the Eminem song Venom
Winged Venom is so badass
Yuo*
This video sucks There isn’t a puppy break Smh I thought you would’ve known better 😔
Hey zanny there is new character in overwatch 2😂😂😂
Ur too late spiderman weed has been legalized😂😂😂
how the fuck do you not know what a particle accelerator is its the coolest physics thing since the moon landing
Zanny has unlocked a new personality
i usually really like your videos but you came off so annoyingly unlikable in this one
Can’t believe we didn’t get a “They fly now?!” When Venom grew wings
"Gimme dodge attacks and combos" zanny may have abandoned for honor, but for honor will never abandon zanny
1:00 2004 Spider-Man 2 on PS2/Game Cube entered the chat
Bro Harry’s window is a true victim
19:42 I fucking died
The cumsuit is lit
22:55 two buttons
17:16 the Loki Treatment!
Bro wants to play bayonetta
particle accelerator: what happens if a death star shoots at another death star.
@17:40 Venom on a bicycle LMFAO 🤣🤣
Top 5 zanny Video title
Did he make a skit over my joke in another comment section? I feel so special
Insomniac pleeaassseee add new game +
im getting prototype vibes from symbiote gameplay. very original
I agree 100% with all you'r complaints. Also I liked more the story from the first Spiderman. Still a good game, solid 8/10 for me.
I remember playing the game for the first time. Being introduced to the particle accelerator & thinking ‘yep this is gonna blow up in the climax’
I dont understand how you want them to change the gameplay more. I really dont understand what they could possibly do. I guess they could just make it not a spiderman game at all but i personally like that
Day 12 of Patrolling the Mojave wishing Zanny would play Fallout New Vegas
No fr they streamlined the combat wayyy too much to the point that every encounter feels the exact same. There's huge lack of creativity in the combat compared to the first game
Uncharted Series!!!!!
I wish flashbang man was a real suit
14:34 😅
this is incredible lmao!
I feel like I missed by not including enough cutscenes for people to follow the story. That's my bad gamers. Will always try to do better with every new vid 🙏
8:14 sum dirt
“Its so veiny”😭😭😭😭
5:42 my parents before school
Considering i beat the game on the hardest difficulty whilst severely underleveled (was like 32 when i finished) watching Zanny blow through is a bit overwhelming lol
1:58 lmao
Bro is the main character of “Split”
On the hardest difficulty the kraven fight and the miles vs Peter fight was a blast, super fast paced just duking it out
Play ultimate difficulty Zanny. Kinda difficult lowkey.
This is such a good game why u hating on it
As someone who loves symbiotes and know their original origins on the comics... You have no idea how much I hate that Venom somehow wins against Anti-Venom
Venom breaking someone's back is giving me Ultimate Spider-man flashbacks  also symbiote hosts? Web of Shadows be like 😌
Will I watch this video? No, because I still have hope it will come out on PC
Ngl this guy sounds like the biggest dunkey clone
I hate the no gravity fight moves.
hey now, I'm an employed genshin player 😂
Bro from Italy, cant freakin stop laughing ya the best fam
Miles really defibrilated him without taking his shirt off...
it’s so interesting to watch this because we complain about the completely different shit.
The particle accelerator is the thing that gave the Flash superpowers, this means that Flash will be in the next game
Ngl this is funny asf
BRO PUT THE GAMEPLAY AND I FUCKING FELL FOR IT
Zanny, Zanny, Zanny…when are you gonna try Baldur’s gate 3?? I need the great legendary mythical notorious infamous Zanny Review before I execute the younglings
surprised you had no reaction to the change in the black suit design
every moment is a moment i will treasure
8:00 bro does not know about arachnids
Zanny play genshin
I swear. If the best performance award doesn't go to Yuri, it's a fucking crime against humanity
The point of a tight suit is stealth  7:52 Zanny: 'The power of the sun...'
brilliant but lazy
Idk man he complained combat was one button but then he proceeded to have a mf blast pressing said button
miles final suit is so ass 😭
Will you play Lords of the Fallen Zanny?!
Am I the only one that can’t change the quality?
they really snuck some metal gear rising in there
There is an entire list of moves you can do but it's easier to mash square and cum
"We are not Venom" when the antivenom suit appeared is such a genius and hilarious joke. Zanny is truly something else.
"I dumped 10 million random dog videos to it's pattern recognition database." Sounds like something @theonlyzanny would do if he had a robot dog
I'm so glad he's being mean to MJ. Fuck MJ dude.
MUST BE HER TIME OF THE MONTH 💀💀 Brooooo
4:17 What do you mean? I have a full time job and also making good enough from youtube too.🤣 15:10 the same shit happened with me too, had to restart the whole fight.😅
16:55 broke him like a kitkat bar😂😂
9:55 DONT ABBREVIATE THIS DONT DO IT
I was here
1:17  what did i witness here? 😂😂
zanny is too quick with the Raimi quotes
Did anyone realize MJ's photo looks like the frog meme?
22:16 THEY FLY NOW?!!!
Play Galactic contention, its a star wars mod for squad. its down rn but should be up in the next month or two.
i think zanny is totk for goty
Best video I've seen in a while.
Whoever thought it was a good idea to put hair on a spider suit, was wrong
Zanny how could u forget to do Howard side quest
The fact they put a comic accurate(ish) anti-venom origin with a twist shows a great love for Spiderman. In the comics, Venom gaslights Eddie Brock into thinking he has cancer… to which he then actually develops cancer. He goes to Mister Negative and after interacting with him, is cured. However, Venom comes back and trying to attach to Eddie, venom mixes with the negative particles and becomes Anti-Venom. Pretty neat.
10:23, 14:46, 18:41 & 20:41 I spit out my drink
"It's not a bug, it's a bethesda reference" is the single greatest sentence that has ever come out of a Human's mouth
*Seriously.* The old Raimi movie tie-in Spider-Man video games from 2004-07 had a day-night cycle. There is no excuse for Insomniac's games not to have one.
Lizard was just taking the 19 inches of venom 😧
I didn't mind the combat not changing a ton, they added JUST enough to where all through the game I was chasing the upgrades to inch it forward a bit. Honestly my biggest critique is not how combat functions, I just wish they shook up the animations and added more new finishers; I feel like that would go a LONG way in making it feel more fresh but its like 80% reused and 20% new. But the abilities and quality of life stuff added to combat kept it fresh enough for me to be happy. If the Arkham games can get by with next to no combat evolution so can these games lol however I do hope for a bit more newness next time
ah yes fight women 2
24:00 Hold on a minute, what's Senator Armstrong doing here
Bro says square mashing is getting old on the second game like every souls game doesnt have the exact same gameplay loop
8:04 he became Desmond miles from ac valhalla
15:21 “that’s a cute outfit. Did your husband give it to you?”
Where is the puppy commercial break? Is it ok? Is it alright?
Damn that thumbnail game's top notch
A particle accelerator accelerates particles 👍
Why are you complaining your on easy mode, i know higher dificulty makes them spongy, but it also makes them agressively hard, its like spiderman souls game trust me.
What a great wat to make us watch ads
listen i understand what zanny's complaining about with the game, but only because i heard it elsewhere, I'm not listening to criticism from someone who played For Honor as long as he has
Pop ups for kids to help them play the game . MEANWHILE US THE SUPERIOR OLD RACE OF TITANS PLAYING GAMES BACK IN 00' .no universal key bindings, no tutorial , smashing buttons to find wtf . Stuck in a fucking stage?! Go buy pc magazine. Want to try games? Oh here magazines with demos cds for you to try 15 games ..... aaaah
Dang u really not gonna like the Batman Arkham games if u don’t like mashing one button for combat they’re the reason the spidey games are the way they are.
6:15 , 7:15 and 8:50 is my favourite ngl 😂
About why is there practicly no cops in NY: Its because devs, instead listening to everyone screeming about how shit MJ segment is, listened to twitter fucks who said that cops in original were gloryfied and how problematic it is.
So you know that part in the forbidden starwars movie episode 8 where they launch the cruiser at lightspeed into the other cruiser they do that with particles to do an anakin and fuck around and find out
If this game gets game of the year, im quiting life
Lmao the before you buy gameranx reference was elite😂
Bro Fr jujustu kaizen venoms ass at the end
"it's another npc mission, wait there's no sound" Oh my.
18:38 don't worry. He's just going through a phase.
I do like that *SPOILERS FOR THE POST CREDITS SCENES*  Just a tad bit of speculation:            The second post credits scene teases Cindy Moon, in fact, reveals her.  I had a theory crafting session witha big Marvel-fan buddy of mine (Shout-Out Daan Alpha), what we came up with is that in the DLC, or next game, the first half of the story will be that Miles and Peter fight the Green goblin, they fight him throughout the city after unearthing the secrets behind the Green Goblin and his mysterious motives, ending at Oscorp, where Norman has prepared a trap (that backfires), which accidentally releases some other villains (I don't know enough to name any, so fill in for yourself) and a Radioactive Spider he was planning to bite Harry with, but instead of biting Harry, it bites Cindy.   Now how did Cindy end up at Oscorp? Well, she is obsessed with the young sSpiderman, and she has a suspicion it might be Miles, so she stalks the young Spiderman, and hacks into the communications between young Spiderman and Peter Spiderman, and realises they think Norman is going to lead them to Oscorp to be at his strongest (he'll have his bombs and shit on hand easily). As a result of which, Cindy manages to get into the Oscorp building, and accidentally gets locked into the trap room both Spidermen are in.  Back to the Radioactive Spider meant for Harry, it finds both of them in a room hiding, and bites her because the spider realises she's the healthier individual (F*** ing die Harry, sorry not sorry), which creates Silk (we'll ignore that she is normally bitten by the same spider as Peter, and has a love interest in him).  Then as a result of the traproom having failed (thanks to Ganke and his hacking skills), the released villains are the second half of the video game, which begins with the Spidermen being applauded at the city hall, where Peter then unmasks and announces his retirement (then marries MJ and fucks off on a honeymoon).   This means that Silk and Miles have to work together to stop the villains, at first they are working against each other, both trying too hard to capture the same guy, constantly being in each other's way, then nearing the end they realise their feuding isn't helping their parents' dating, so they decide to try and work together, then at the end there's a big battle with some other big villain that I can't name because I know fuck all about lore. And then they are the new Spider-duo.  Miles stays with Hailey btw, this isn't PH...    As for how Carnage (teased in the Cult-Flame missions) fits in, idk, figure that out yourself, maybe he'll stay as a side-quest lol
i keep getting you and Nano mixed up
What I don't understand is why didn't MJ just take down Kraven from the beginning? She's clearly the strongest being in the PS5 spider-verse, with great jawlines comes great responsibility.
8:53 *Straight to Miguel!* 😂😂
The dickridining is insane
2:07 Hahahaha and he just breaks his teeth in the asphalt.
i am so disappointed in myself because i god sucked into the mobile game partd
Well it because you had "gaming news" sites complain about cops so there are no cops anymore.
Notice how the shoes on Mile's Adidas suit don't change color with the other suit variants? Adidas ordered Insomniac to leave them as is
Ngl elden ring ruined other single player games for me
Can you play a popular rising horror game called: lethal company
That star wars episode 3 game was nuts on Xbox Original holy shieet
When he laughs at bad games is funny, but with this video the jokes were a little bit annoying ngl.
I like that Mary Jane’s Tazer gun got a webshooter upgrade and sonic upgrade I wish you could   Switch between taser mode web gun mode and sonic mode
The games have been the same for 10 years now. Similar Story to the Amazing spiderman 2 game as well, Amazing how many sony fan boys are saying its a 10/10 masterpiece. ITs good. its fine and thats okay. not worrth the money at 70 bucks for what is essentially more dlc
Alternative title "Spiderman 2 but I'm the boss fight"
I do understand the complaints... The early game is a bit lackluster with content... However that last like 5 to 6 hours is just straight fucking crazy balls-to-the-wall Comics crazy bullshit
Devil May Cry when
4:19 as a Genshin player I agree
Venom's biggest weakness the male reproductive system.
You call a Bethesda reference, i see a cyberpunk main feature
18:37 peter sent the symbiote to the backrooms
18:05 Foul lmao  Another one OH HELL NAW 22:02 HAHAHAHA
This game is so disappointing imo....
I love the part where Harry said "it's venoming time" and venomed all over peters wife
the reason there are no more cops is cuz why bother when spidermans around
Shame your Miles-Peter fight got ruined
whos gonna tell him the arkham combat is only one button
Post-Elden Ring Zanny has high game standards
I must say miles has some drip suits
I mean after 3 games with all essentially the same combat, no wonder it’s a little stale
Bro out here disrespecting the genshin community.... FUCK THEM YEAH(iam one of them)
No joke play dying light 2
21:03 CANON FACT: It is a confirmed constant in the multiverse that every version of Miles Morales known to man must suffer a public media controversy involving "shameless brand endorsement" at least ONCE in their entire career run as Spiderman. For ITSV Miles, it's his baby powder sponsor. For Insomniac Miles, it's his spidersuit collab with Adidas. For Marvel Miles, it's for endorsing the shitty modern marvel comics. Every Miles in every timeline must suffer the consequences of his actions, for better or for worse. *_It's just canon._*
18:57 22:02 my soul left my body haven't laughed so hard in a while 🤣🤣🤣
This would never happen in the real world because we can just use metal pipe drop sound effect against symbiots
Zanny: Lego games are too easy Spedr-man 2: Lego with extra steps
playing as Venom is identical to Grimlock in Fall of Cybertron
A particle accelerator is like 2 mini death-stars that shoot protons (and other particles) at each other to see how they go boom when the beams collide. This helps scientists understand what the particles are made of, by blowing them to smithereens.
Love how everyone reaction was basically the same when it came to Miles changing suits at the endgame. "What the fuck are you actually wearing?" is what I said when I first saw it, I know it was trying to look cool and shiz but ngl, every other one of his suits were way more badass then what he got... It also didn't help that it felt like it came out of nowhere.
The before you buy got me 😂
Woman: You're just a man in a costume...playing the hero Spider-man: You're just a woman in a costume...who play the villain(or belong to the streets your choice)
Zanny where's the monster hunter vids sorry if ur on a tight schedule
12:07 peter almost got the chancla 💀
from what is that sound zanny uses at 3:25?
The way you say lines from the Raimi films so nonchalantly gets me every time
Krave-ON, Krave-OFF, Krave-ON, Krave-OFF
Last game was in Manhattan and they got cool cops New York is New York
Hey zanny Love your videos, I'm only here to recomend you play watch dogs I'm sure you will like it :) I would love to see your reactions of the game
The interspersed review segments black suit Zanny were golden. Although the funniest part is still Miles' lame adidas costume.
I actually got an oreo ad on this video.🤣
ZANNY ALAN WAKE 2 REVIEW PLEASEEE 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I mean I like the game but he's right about what he said about the problems of the game.
Can’t wait for the arkham games!
Yeah watching this from another persons perspective really does show besides the main story and some good side quests the game can be very boring I still think its a good game just wish they would of added a bit more so it didn’t feel that way also im glad im not the only one who thinks the combat is pretty boring but besides combos idk what they could include to make it feel more interactive
As a Genshin player who's studying mechanical engineering i cam confirm i am unemployed  Also thank you for sponsoring it once
All sus moments: You are about to face 3 inches in your mouth Venom is sippiting out 19 inch erectum towers It’s so vainy It’s so big Am I scared or am I horny Here he comes haha 😐 Love you zanny btw
7:45 ps5 is so much better than the Xbox Lolol. Stfu
Would love to see an Immortals Fenyx Rising play through from zanny
At least zanny isn’t a complete hypocrite. If you’re gonna call out Jedi survivor you also have to call out spider man 2.
11:56 man i can't control🤣🤣
Little did we know the 19 inches of venom was also equal to the number of minutes he has as an actual character
Is it me or has mj gotten ugly
character named scream is weak to sound........irony died 100 deaths here
mj looks like mr.beast
I thought it was my game just giving me the flashbang peter, was it everyone too?
Yee
I was really waiting for "They fly now?" when Venom got his wings...
Bro i swear zanny has the most unique content ever, Just the way he ignores the dialogue and the story in addition to missing out on all the cool suits in the game is just remarkable, This man right here is a staple in the gaming community, The way this guy makes funny references over the writing and essentially memes over the entire game is truly amazing.  Bro this was an amazing video, A Spectacular Video, You could even say a Friendly Neighborhood video. Well done man, You cooked once more. It makes me want to beat.
Spider man 2 was honestly a slow burner
Thank god someone said the side quests were ass, wheres riot, phage, agony and lasher for the symbiote nests as bosses? wheres cameos like web of shadows or ultimate spiderman? why were good villains relegated to mid side quests like sandman and mysterio and then both got done dirty, especially mysterio who was just 2 random women and they made the actual mysterio look like an idiot when hes supposed to be a malicious genius. Mysterio is also good for getting in peters head which helps with the symbiote story but nope he has to be a MILES VILLIAN? also shocker got off screened so not shocker lines, huge let down. The lack of unique qualities the symbiote suit offers not including abilities is disappointing, no new "gadgets" for it, not unique combo strings, no unique mechanics overall. Kraven hideouts couldve been much better if they all included a villain at the end as a boss fight since kraven is catching villains like they are pokemon. Severe lack of goated suits and overabundance of trash "original" suits. All these villains just suddenly becoming good citizens with 0 explanation and lack of spidermans direct help is crazy since the entire point of them becoming villains is due to the fact they cannot fit into society, they chose villainy because they felt they had no other choice yet now they all seem to fit easily which doesnt feel earned or make any sense to begin with and makes them come off as more evil due to the fact they all couldve easily made it by without ever turning to crime the way its presented. Back to side missions it is good to be the friendly neighborhood spiderman helping the little people but do it in a way thats nice and not insultingly checking off a box to make sure they hit their woke agenda, howards mission for example is amazing yet the rest feel lifeless and dont respect the people they are trying to represent.
I cant believe you didnt pull single Amber Heard joke during Scream fight
19:42
I lost it at the 3 inches joke ☠️
Gotta appreciate the power of Venom when its on Peter
Both you AND jacksepticeye had that glowing body glitch! And you were both wearing the same suit at that moment too!
Particle accelerator is machine which can take a partical close to light speed
Great video as always! But where are the doggos???
Idk if it is like this is spider man 2 but in the other games I’m pretty sure once you beat the story you get a time cycle. You must unlock time
It's fun to see Zanny having fun after the symbiote was introduced.
i’ve not seen a single playthrough where spiderman didn’t turn into a glow stick during that flame mission
If youve read the comics you would’ve know venom had wings
I found that trying to make my combat more air oriented helped with things getting stale. Pulling enemies up, lifting them for more height, jumping off an enemy and swing kicking another into a air lift combo. It opens up a lot of options you might not have considered.
Zanny play spiderman Web of shadows!!!!!!!
So Peter couldn't beat Venom with the 'ANTI-VENOM' suit but miles with his paid Adidas promotion suit could beat him?
Danny is never fails to make me giggle and make my feet kick back and forth.
19:42 Had me dying at 3am
After you're done with the batman games I would highly recommend the last of us
But isn’t Scream kinda bad tho?
Definitely watched secure team with that Astro song
Tell me you’re an Xbox player without telling me:
Souls like player complaining spider man isn't a souls like.... just saying
It's not always about the game not being finished Spider-man     It's more about reinforcing the link with the symbiote
11:56 Made me laugh harder than I should’ve🤣
"Don't say it Peter." Got me rolling
VENOM CAN FLY NOW?!
2:01 the explosion was so powerful it turned Miles from black to white lol
Spiderman 2 going gold a month before release and so many things not included in the game that were present in the previous one lmao
I love how zanny gave 3 inches to scream 😂
that's a really good title
Seems like you’re experiencing a skill issue
Particle accelerator in Star Wars terms is unlimited power
Yummy video
Want really fun combos in a pve game, try nioh 2 or the original.
no more destiny videos or for honor or halo ...i just want  you to play with da boys
Can the final chapter give me my Felicia Hardy back? 🥺
i think the cops not showing up to help out is cause twitter folk made a big deal out of Spiderman palling around with cops to fight crimes so devs wussed out and didnt make them prevalant as much
It accelerates particles, basically what happens when you hyper jump in star wars but has a higher chance of setting fire alone.
I'm glad not everyone is sucking this game off and ignoring the repetitive or unfun content in the game. Still a great game tho.
yeah this shit isn’t game of the year. it’s an improvement but it’s rushed as hell in the third act and full of dumb bugs. and the suits are bad.
Surly you fight Darth maul in this?
Thought for people regarding the square mashing, isn't that very similar to the arkham games especially when you do the beatdowns? I think some of them had better animations for it but spamming the attack button feels like a gameplay staple for the genre.
Robot dog? Called fido? Im sensing an 86 reference...
I assume coming off from the souls series, the combat in spiderman can be lackluster.
"Miles, get in here! Fuck this guy."  I don't know, man. Sounds kinda gay.
Particle accelerator? An x-wing going to light speed with a bowl of salad as the driver. Reason? To either see how good the salad is at driving or to see what a liquid crouton looks like.
Zanny: says there needs to be more challenging enemies  Also Zanny: gets annoyed when there’s a challenging enemy
I agree completely on this one. It's amazing to swing around as Spiderman but the game feels like an expansion with nothing new and maybe some taken away from the first. Fun to play but I'd recommend waiting for a sale or something.
zanny is proud Filipino.
i think the most tragic part of this game is not getting a spider-man 3 venom suit, peters got the build
10:11 too far indeed
14:36 man hes smart
18:33 he went to the backrooms but said nah im out
21:25 didn’t know Harry was an option select crutch
you've spun your last web finally makes sense
A particle accelerator is a machine which collides two sub atomic particles which in turn breaks and gives us even smaller sub atomic particles. This helps us understand quantum physics. For your information currently the largest collider is made by CERN in Geneva which is called the hadron collider.
I love this channel but holy shit this mightve been your least entertaining video it was just so much complaining man
Spider man 2 video game it’s amazing love playing as Sam Raimi black suit in the game
Spider-Man isn't really a character that has a lot of narrative potential via a videogame. Especially not if you have licesing reatrictions that prevent you from utilizing other heroes or his best villains. And considering this setting is the usual modern day New York, there's not really much you can do in way of gameplay other than just beating guys up.  Peter's a broke guy that relies on his girlfriend to help pay his mortgage and can't hold down a stable job. It's already unbelievable that he can afford all the tech in his suits and gadgets. Try to expand the scope to something like Batman where he has crime scene simulators and fingerprint analysis that matches against police databases, and you're gonna lose your audience.  I get it's kind of repetitive, but with the way the world of this IP has been set up, there's not much Spider-Man can do besides beat people up. Unless you wanna play the sidequests of him being the _actual_ "friendly neighborhood" guy that saves cats, helps old ladies cross the street, and gives life advice to teenagers suffering from bullying. That doesn't make for engaging gameplay. And his strength and spider sense make most problems so non-threatening that combat is the only thing that really has any staying power to fuel an entire gaming experience.
Bruh this spider-man has so much symbiote fan service its amazing
“You’re lucky this is rated T dude, otherwise you’d be dead” PROCEEDS TO USE A MAN LIKE A HAMMER FOR WHACK A MOLE AND IS MOST DEFINITELY A CORPSE AT THAT POINT
They fly now
That's a great title Zanny
Love zanny still keeping the content entertaining
How did you get all the glitches save some for the rest of us 💀
So, fun fact for you: apparently the first game was criticized for being too "pro-cop" somehow, and so their solution was to basically get rid of any cop presence for this game and only have fire fighters and first responders actually do something.
Holy its crazy how many bugs you had in your playthrough. I had barely any
Spider man 2 is a boring trash.
3 inches of me💀
As a genshin player I would like to say I have a full time job at a shop
2:08 that’s gold
🙏🏿👊🏿
6:59 zanny laughed like lego batman
Nah dude You are just an Xbox fanboy you always have been 😂. There is tons of mini games and side content and is genuinely better than the first game. But to each their own . Imo For honor and Xbox in general is mid. You are right about the combos tho. But again Batman did the same thing but nobody mentions that.
I'm happy that zanny like Superior suit. Would be even better if you could give Felicia Superior treatment.
Glad to see that I'm not the only one who made the "sabatical" joke. Except I did it when Vemon finaaly arrived and murdered the entire OsCorp security team as Harry.
With the NYPD never showing up, it’s lowkey more accurate
Did you get ea fc 24?? 🤔
that counter dulls your senses for games with actual difficulty.
"Brilliant, but lazy" 😅 honestly the best way to describe it
what a title😂😂
Spiderman white coom vs black coom
"Kraven krathev kravenov" killed me😂😂😂
now im just waiting for him to play baldurs gate 3
Peters cannon event is not having a job
got a belly laugh out of me for 17:06 😂
Spider-Man drank the slur juice
2023 video coming soon?
19:17 love how both zanny and insomniac straight up pulled a Thor ragnorok by straight up saying “don’t worry may I’ll get you out”(proceeds to punch kick and straight up beat the hell out of them)
A particle accelerator could be described as a high-tech device used to enhance the power and capabilities of various energy-based weapons and equipment. Here's an analogy to help explain it:  Imagine a particle accelerator in Star Wars as a "Force Amplifier." This fictional technology harnesses the power of subatomic particles to enhance the performance of lightsabers, blasters, and other energy-based weapons and devices. The Force Amplifier consists of a complex system of electromagnetic fields and advanced crystals.  When a Jedi or a skilled technician activates the Force Amplifier, it funnels and accelerates tiny energy particles, similar to midi-chlorians in the Star Wars universe. These accelerated particles then infuse the wielder's weapon, making it more powerful and destructive. Lightsabers become even more lethal, blasters shoot bolts with increased speed and precision, and energy shields can withstand more intense attacks.  Think of the Force Amplifier as a way to tap into the hidden energies of the Star Wars universe, allowing characters to reach new heights of strength and effectiveness in combat. It's a technological marvel that fits right into the galaxy far, far away!
17:38 how much and where
i want to try to get anti-venom renamed to antidote. would fit just as well and sounds cooler. venom vs. antidote. oh and great vid too!
Great Game. Only wish it has a Darth Maul boss fight
Partical Accelerater in Star Wars terms would be two atoms doing the Holdo Maneuver.
Game of the year? I bet it’s Alan Wake 2
Im so glad zanny isnt dick riding this game. It is an amazing game but it has a lot of flaws people have been denying since before the game came out. Its less arkham asylum to city quality and more city to origins (maybe a bit harsh but best example i can think of)
As much as I enjoyed Zanny being a real villain all over the place, the editing approach wasn't the most likeable, it was like someone took a comic and stripped off every page that allowed it to make sense, so instead now it had only the violence segments. As a good comic book enjoyer I have to say; Zanny sit down one day and read some good comics whether villain or hero ones, that's my recommendation.
Three point sa-bear combo got me
0:18 you can’t lie to me Zanny, ssethtzeentach did that joke first.
3 point sabeBEAR combo got me
Feels like an okay game but yeah ... no day time or weather change mechanic is real lazy ... fights seems kinda okay but after 5h lazy too ..  Past spiderman games were full of good ideas and good things and bad stuff too ... man I dont know could they just up the score a bit so we are a 10/10 an not a 8/10 at max ?
Zanny ultimate spider-man has a playable venom my dude
The blatant reuse of assets from older games is just so lame. 70 bucks and they can't even make their own environments
spooder man spooder man is getting his job taken by zanny
What about alan wake 2 zanny
Bruh really said that game needs combos and charge/dodge attacks about the game that has those.
MJ as a venom host kinda
Scream is a in cannon symbiote   Same with any other symbiote name
I'm gunna put some dirt in your eyes
No one talking about the japan joke lmao
😮😮😮
23:54 Norman Osborne named his son's medicine "Goblin Serum"
Me: resorting to a life of crime so I can provide for my family   Spider-Man: 2:03
Now that I know Doc Ock is voiced by they same guy as Rigby from Regular Show, I can’t unhear it
Damn I never knew that game went as far as killing Kraven and Venom getting wings LMAO
I would have loved if Miles’s girlfriend got turned into a symbiote (probably spelled that wrong) and wasn’t weak to sound because she is deaf.
My penis hurts
I think that zanny should play ultrakill, its mechanics and game design are similar to what he'd like plus hes already been in max0r's ultrakill act 1 video soooo
It's not a big it's a Bethesda reference 😂😂😂
I finished spider man on the second day and 100% on seventh
Bully lowenthal is a bigger menace than izuny, change my mind.
A particle accelerator is basically a giant racing course that shoots things REALLY fast to intentionally crash into each other to get a result. In other words, it's podracing from Star Wars episode 1.
Easily one of Zanny’s funniest videos yet
I read to the end of the comments and you can too :), it was kinda disheartening to se that 20k people were spending their time writing these comments while they could be writing essays about world hunger but I guess I am also hear and I’m probably worse so…     Zanny rocks! ;)
19:07 everyone
At the particle accelerator shotgun scene I thought he was going to play nirvana
YOOO REVENGE OF THE SITH PS2 REFERENCE
zanny, i just want you to know, your fifa videos made me try fut after 7 years break. it has been a mistake. notwithstanding the fomo and mtx every aspect of the game is broken. the menu bugs out every 2 hours, the servers are laggy all the time and feel like 500ms ping and the "moments" gameplay they added doesnt work at all half the time. add to that the way the meta shakes out in regards to the attacking/defending ai, its all in all a pretty dysmal situation. so thank you.
I call bullshit on your criticism if you are hitting one button you suck you need to be moving around spamming abilities, gadgets, webs, throws, and on hard mode that is really necessary, as to side quests there is drone piloting, emf puzzles, prowler puzzles, the gliding missions, stealth blinds, base take downs, then a few random unique quests.  Main story has normal sections, stealth sections, spider bot sections , MJ sections and the venom section.   Like i don’t know what you want. I could have used a couple more venom rampages but gameplay variety was not bad and what was there was enjoyable.
zanny playing the Arkham games would go absolutely hard
I mean if it’s combos you’re looking for then Devil May Cry is right there
That daredevil joke got me. Didn’t think about it until he said it makes no sense. I don’t usually audibly laugh at these videos but I did there
Lack of police in the game is a subtle reference to the defund the police movement.
Agent Venom game, do it Insomniac
7:52 I got this glitch too and took a screenshot of it then loaded from last check point and it got fixed I loved it
Hey guys, I just make Piano Cover of Spider-man 2 main theme (peter + miles + harry), please visit my channel to support me. Thank you ^^  Next 2 weeks I will make Background Free Roam music as well. I hope my music will serve u guys well!  (Cant paste link here because Youtube will strike me 😢)
"Brilliant but lazy" feels like it should have been on the cover. I love the game, but it feels like it's being arkham asylum, when I KNOW they could bring us another arkham city: What they're doing isn't BAD, just... sigh... lazy.
Man, Adum’s gonna hate this game.
W for not glazing
19:14 her symbiote name isnt scream normally mj isnt scream but scream is like carnage one of venoms children
Theres so many fan boys who can't take a joke or accept the game was mid

Your symbiote jokes made me smile this day
DUDE YOU DESERVE A FUCKIN SUB. I've been laughing my ass off from the start of this video, all the jokes are so good.😂😂
Zanny Editing is so fucking top notch i swear to fucking dick balls
Hey Zan-Man,  So I've been wanting to make gaming videos for a while now, and I wanted to ask how you record the gameplay on xbox. I've looked for a way to do it and nothing I've found has worked, so if you could give me the name of a software or something that'd be great man.   Leftover Regards, MazE_007-  P.S. If anyone else knows a way to do this pls lemmie know.
Honestly I hated when I had anti venom and was just spraying cum everywhere
11:03 “peter’s on sabbatical honey.” Got me good.
"I'm gonna put some web in your ass" 💀💀💀💀💀
22:17 they fly now? They fly now!
Wait, so venom is weak to hitting the bell and the metal pipe falling sound effect
More like..Cringeman 2.
Zanny do you not realise what L3+R3 does when the bar is full? WHY DONT U USE IT
Oi, you forgot about the extra credit scene!
WHY TF CANT YOU CHANGE THE TIME OF DAY???
@gameranx has gotta see this 15:35
I had that same Peter venom glitch where he got stuck in tree
This video is actually so enjoyable wtf
come back to for honor its og now
Sasuke is pissed every time he speaks XD
Mister negative fr just a taken captain 😂
Was scream MJ in the comic? For those who know
I really enjoyed the side quest with Hailey. My only complaint about it was having to shake the spray can, but I thought the rest was a nice change of pace before getting back to the Spider-man of it all.
That's not a bug. That's a subtle reference that Tobey Mcguire is a god.
Particle accelerator in star wars terms- midichlorian hyperdrives
No puppy break 😢
You know what’s hilarious Kraven is the name of a fast food delivery service in my country I couldn’t stop laughing 😅😅😅😅
did he just say adi das
6:49 I Died
I forgot entire video when Venom started choking us.
"19 INCHES - she's getting it, what the fuk."  Made me laugh out loud
From what I heard the reason that there’s no police in this game is because Insomniac didn’t want to help make police look good because people complained about the last game  having too much “copaganda”.
Devil May Cry does good combos too, just saying would make for an interesting follow up series to the batman series
now I want a sybioid zanny hot takes series
I think I was the only one who experienced no bugs at all during the game 💀
"If someone said you've run out of web-fluid... somebody lied."  - Zanny, probably  (In all seriousness I hope the people who worked on the game are ok.)
Idk what's zannys issue with day and night cycle, the last game didn't have it either, you get the cycle switching after finishing the story just like in the last one.
Everytime Zanny is playing as Symbiote Spiderman or Venom: "AH YESS THE POWER... FEELS GREAT!"
great another guy youtube reccomended me with clickbait in title why should I have to keep blocking these people. finishing a game before the dev yeah right.........
LOL NOT THE HOGWARTS LEGACY MUSIC DURING HAILEY'S MISSION
You really just violated the one and only Venom in a freakin cum suit.
the 11:56 music  was to good lol
Feel like the graphics look like a ps2 game
Who Would Win? Mean Symbiote Spider-Man Vs Lotus Spider-Man
I'm disappointed at you, Zanny. Truly disappointed. The first clip could've used a metal piple falling sound!
I noticed that the "symbiote" brings up a complaint and then the next piece of gameplay directly contradicts it showing Zanny having fun with said thing
Why did Zanny sound jealous when MJ was getting it from Venom
So Batman next.
zanny legit sounding like my grumpy ass grandpa when he complains about this game  and I dont even disagree with him
Bro will find anything to bitch about… it’s a superhero game they aren’t going to go super complicated with combat because kids are gonna play it. Just stop bitching so much. Love the videos but the crying is getting so annoying. I can appreciate the critique but half the video being that is annoying
16:13 bruh what music did you put here, what is it a remix💀
I yell laughed at Venom on a bike
it's the plague of almost every open world game: repetitive activities in order to fill the void.  Insomniac said that the time of day wouldn't be changeable during story because of story purposes which ehh, I kinda get it tbh, some games like Cyberpunk 2077 feel weird with you having a timebomb in your head yet you have all the time in the world for side activities.  And lastly, I agree with you about the combat. It's like Insomniac tried to replicate the FreeFlow combat from the Arkham series but they didn't notice that the part that made the gameplay so unique was the way Batman was so snappy as well as the variety of enemies making you plan your next move. Shield guy, big buff guy, every one of them takes a different strategy and so you can link stuff back to back but in Spider-man it feels same-y aside the gadgets probably because they went with the idea of Spidey being nimble and thus dodging instead of parrying.  Also the enemy variation is almost never mixed together making it feel very repetitive.
The UI looks straight out of a PS2 game
I agree with what u said abt the combat, I was making it fun by trying to keep air combos as long as possible and stay off the ground which is pretty hard
Yo that closing music 👀 jacked from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTfIGs0N9b8
Tbh zanny I think you’re kind of dead wrong about the combat I mean you can say it’s simple, but you definitely can’t say it’s just pressing square
Im gonna go into some HEAVY SPOILERS IN HERE SO PLEASE SKIP IF YOU HAVENT FINISHED THE GAME   I honestly didn't love the story. I think Peter was repeatedly done dirty. That MJ/Scream fight was absolutely atrocious. Peter saying Miles is a better spider man than him. Miles getting the final Venom fight while Peter is KO'd. I have a hard time believing all of this wasn't deliberate to push Miles as the new Spider Man. I'm okay with Miles taking a more central role in the story but not at the expense of Peters and surely not at the expense of making Peter look bad at every corner. Miles being able to beat Symbiote Peter was just pure nonsense, even with a bell nearby.
I can’t tell if he hates the game or not 😂
Is it the dangerously horny part of my brain that wishes MJ got to keep the Scream symbiote, minus the crazy...?  Nah, it is clearly the rational part focused on story and gameplay potential.
The reason there's no police in the game is because the devs listened to the idiots on the left saying fuck the police.
Te quiero mucho, Zanny
the cops thing is because several people on twitter complained about the cops on spider man 2018 due to cop agression at the time so insominiac removed the cops off the gameplay
LMFAO act 3 is mostly sex jokes- ☠️😭
Why is norman osborn's climax scene is him saying ASAP out loud lmaooo
Strawberries🍓
Damn you Zanny, you spread the symbiote to me. I agree with your takes and can't stop myself from watching your videos..hes infected me!
THERE IS NO WAY HE PASSED BY THIS JOKE WITH NO SUBTEXT 11:45
I thought you're gonna highlight the "I'm fresh outta honey" part
a particle accelerator is a track for pod racing but with sub atomic particles going to almost lightspeed
13:32 Missed opportunity to say Krave-en
Thank you for this Zanny. 🙏🏼 I picked the series X. 🫠 So this is as close as I will get to play. Replaying Spider man on PS4 tho 👀
Just curious, what did you think of Shattered Dimensions’ or Web of Shadows’ combat?
my guy there are combos tf you mean no combos???
I REALLY like Mr. Negative. His powers are way more interesting than just being named after an animal like every other Spider-Man villain. 12:31
Looked it up because I was curious. Dream's face reveal is so fucking unsettling for some reason. It just doesn't look right.
They didn't change too much with the gameplay, I agree. But it's still hella fun. Just like the Arkham games.  But I too feel the lack of the police or other superheroes was weird. Like what Venom did to the city was definitely an Avengers level threat, no? Where are the other heroes? We know they exist in this game's world. This breaks my immersion. Or even just SHIELD? Heck they could've reskin the Sable Mercs from the previous game, and name them Shield Peacekeepers, and drop them to any location you fight symbiotes. I'd have been cool with that.
Can I say how much I laugh just watching one of the Zannies videos
6:45 not the spider-man lotus💀
Man I love your videos so much you just make me laugh keep going ❤
Why is Zanny not hyped? Is he stupid?
How does anyone choose to live in New York?
If you took out the video I wouldn’t be able to tell what game it is since his commentary is now 4-6 references or “jokes” that get Slowly rotated out used to be a new 1 or 2 a video u get a new joke once every 2-3 videos now
I want to see Zanny play Devil May Cry
Want to say for those who think this game is easier, on Spectacular and Ultimste the damage you do is alot less even with symbiote special moves and rage, its then a truly difficult challenge
When u go do crimes Miles or Wraith or Agent Venom sometimes will help you just saying since u said the crimes feel like you’re alone
17:11   *zanny* “your lucky this is rated pg youd be dead otherwise”  *Venom* FUCKING KILLS HIM
Oh no, the symbiote. It’s taking over me, making me rate the game an 8/10 for story and gameplay problems
where are the Arkham vids zanny ??!!! *Christian Bale batman* WHERE ARE THEY!!??
10:28, Had Peter let Miles help him subdue Lizard, he wouldn’t have got the chance to tear through the city and had Peter not been wearing Venom, he would’ve known going to subdue Lizard himself was a bad idea and let Miles follow him.   M.J. isn’t wrong to criticize him.  12:33, In the comics, his energy powers are from another dimension (in Destiny 2 terms, he’s powered by the Void/Darkness) but the games, its more like a psychic energy he manipulates that’s connected to negative emotions (and since he looks like a photonegative, that’s where he got his name, “Mr. Negative”). I much prefer his characterization in this game than in the first, not that he wasn’t complex or his motivations weren’t understandable, but we didn’t get to spend much time with him to see how his actions effected him.  22:11, Symbiote’s being able to sprout wings is a fairly new concept in the comics. Both Venom and Carnage can do it.
So next game (or DLC) we're getting Goblin, Doc Ock (again), Chameleon and CARNAGE! I am hoping they're gonna do a PS1 Spiderman where Carnage attaches to Doc Ock as a Final confrontation.
7:58 the nightlight man
Please play Prototype 2. I would highly recommend the first game but idk if you would in terms of it's graphics but gameplay wise. It's a masterpiece
Should have changed that miles suit
i love your videos!
you know how venom spawns seed well i think he spawned one in peter and than thats what mister negative did
17:30 “You’d be dead otherwise” kills him
154974th some say that’s the real first place
Batman time
i dont get the video's title
22:17 They fly now?
A particle accelerator (in non-Star Wars terms but I'll make it simple). Using super magnets you bring a bunch of the stuff that make up atoms to 99.997% the speed of light and crash them into particles going in the opposite direction also at 99.997% the speed of light. This collision makes new stuff along with exposing the particles that made up the original particles we just collided.
Have you featured any Arkham game in your channel?
15:23 perfect timing
4:50 I’m always so confused when people say this is goty when Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur’s Gate 3 exist.
13:04 he’s out of negawatts wait
@ 2:06 that atomic faceplant wasn't boring. Most fun I've had watching people play this game so far.
God this game is awful
Mr negatives powers are actually interesting (outside of the energy moves which are pretty basic) basically, the better the person, the darker they become when afflicted with the negative energy
Zanny is a Xbox main, so all his opinions on PlayStation exclusives and animal rights are invalid.
I don't know why exactly but something about this makes it stand out from your other recent videos. Keep up the good work!
Pretty good video, the lack of Harry/Venom not saying Strawberries was a big miss though, would’ve sent me to the floor. “We….Are……….(whispers)..Strawberries.”
A particle accelerator is a machine capable of producing the particles that existed a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...
Finally someone that also thinks MJ’s attacks are too fast
Watching this in a mental hospital
He’s not wrong there’s a lot left to the combat even if you do a lot of the new air combat. Story’s great tho and unlucky glitches my dude
am I  the only one that like the evolved suit
i’m glad i wasn’t the only person who had peter get stuck in the tree 😂
The tree glitch happened to me too.
THERE WAS NO PUPPY BREAK  0/10 Gumball's
bro is the quip king
I guess you haven't read the comics, cuz you didnt react to the second bonus scene with Miles. But in case you didnt know, that was Cindy Moon at the end aka Silk, and she was bitten by the same spider that gave Peter his powers. They also can't be in the same room as each other without getting the urge to fuck each other (no that is not a joke, google it). It almost ended Peter's at the time relationship lmao
ecchi content spoated at 19:00
Particle Accelerator = Super-Collider in Spiderverse movie
10:30 WTF is MJ even talking about?! Peter didn’t destroy the city. Lizard did. What was he supposed to do? Not chase him? The exact same thing happened at the beginning of Miles’  game with Rhino destroying the city and no one had a problem with. I love MJ but what were the writers thinking? That made no sense.
13:51 AYYOOOOOO
best present I ever could've gotten on my birthday
7:53 Cum-Man
19:34 when zanny said "My back!" Made me spit out my water istg
look its little goblin senior
i agree with symbiote zanny
Somehow the particles have accelerated
What do you mean it's just the same game for the third time. You can't find anything new?
at 11:56 it was insane 😹. 6:30 : "okay guys there some random blood in this situation i will dirnk to see if i get the sida " 😂
so i searched  what the g serum is and its the goblin serum. Also zanny there is more villains but you need to do the side quests
You didn’t say, “they fly now” when venom got the wings. I am disappointed
Finally someone not brainwashed into saying SPIDERMAN GOTY BEST EVRR GAME NO GAME BEATS IT!!!1!!!1!11 Zanny is right game feels so lacking compared to the first game, 2nd islans was added and it feels so much more empty than the first. Not to meantion it takes 30 hours to 100%
4:25 “How dare you say anything negative about this game! You should just praise it only! It’s a 10/10!”   No but seriously people were actually mad about this game not receiving a perfect score everywhere 😂 It’s a great game but it’s not perfect.
the Devs seid there adding repeat missions and day and night and weather change in a later update before the end of the year 😊
You keep referring to the combat as "mashing square" but what is this "square" you speak of? It is not a tongue I am familiar with.
bro you got bugs i never EVER saw thats wild. i guess i just got lucky cuz ive seen other people report some bugs as well. flashbang man goes hard tho add that in the game if that was a mistake. my favorite suit.
You should try to play the new Mortal Kombat
W vid as always zanny
Zanny: Man this webswinging shit is boring as fuck. *fucking kills miles like it was his fault*
The voice of venom is zoom from the cw flash
4:21 Ok now that’s a more valid critique. The only good side mission was The Flame. Everything else was just a checklist of generic side activities until you collected every such and such and got a cutscene.
The robot arms absolutely should've just been special melee attacks or web attacks with lower damage and quicker recharge
Parry easy af lol just spam a fucking square
Sometimes I feel like half the excitement of a new game for me is knowing Zanny's going to play it
Can you play for honour again so we can see you suffer
day 1 of asking zanny to play Hi-Fi Rush
I don’t get what people were expecting when it came to combat changes. Like you aren’t playing DMC, your playing Spider-Man Arkham. That’s not an insult but I would think it’s way more likely that changing the combat as much as suggested here would make it far worse than better, with things either being useless or impractical.  If you’re just mashing square that is a personal problem, the game gives you enough tools to do more and be varied, if you choose not to do that it’s fine, like clearly it works, but I don’t know why you suggest more tools when you aren’t using what you have…
Puppy brake?
"this is my nonlethal punch" - zanny 2023
As the game went on I turned the difficulty down easier and easier just so the game would finally end
0:44 I could not possibly disagree more. Yes the combat felt pretty repetitive in the first 2 games but there are so many more options in this game. I almost never defeated and enemy the same way twice in an encounter.   There’s regular punch, charged up punch(which is ironic because you complained about this game not having that which just isn’t true), web yank, web throw, web bounce, web disarm, mid air slam, mid air dodging, swing kick, dodging under enemies, I could go on but I don’t want to sound annoying. Not to mention all of the different symbiote, lightning, and tech abilities and gadgets.    I can’t think of many games that gave me more options to take out enemies. I don’t know what game you’re playing if you think you have to spam square. Just as a test, I booted up the game and tried spamming square and I died immediately. 😂 Take the symbiote off Zanny. It’s messing with your mind.
7:59 lol, this bug happened to me in this mission too
Pizza time
whenever spidey turned into the sun at the hospital, it’s bc his base sprite is the sun and they recolored it for all the suits and added on/removed details
play devil may cry
Sucks that probably the most important boss battle in the game was ruined cuz of a stupid bug for Zanny.
I haven’t watched zanny in a while
Would've liked the vid more if zanny was bitching every two minutes
why didn't they give venom the demonic mouth thing?
Fun fact: Venom's voice actor Tony Todd was also the fallen from transformers 2, and the original Candyman.
So I take it you just didn’t know who that was in the last post credit scene?
That Spiderman Lotus joke took me the fuck out 😂😂 *raising hands Scorsese style* COMEDY!
21:32 Americans when diagnosed with a fatal condition
19:43 you’re about to feel 3 inches of ME
I want more monster, hunter world ice born
8:03 MY EYESS
G-serum? he's gonna release the virus like in resident evil
6:48 NOT THE SPIDER-MAN LOTUS PETER
Such a missed opportunity to say:"remember to subscribe and SPAM that bell"
y know, Symbiote-infested New York reminds me a lot of Deimos from Warframe
No. You will mash one button the entire final chapter.
As Uncle Zanny once said: “With Great Power, comes Great Spinal Injury.”
I actually 100% both trophys and ultimate difficulty newgame
22:20  Venom crashing through a building, clutching Peter in his hands.  Miles: *backflips*
22:16 THEY FLY NOW!?!?!
Great video however where is the puppy break ? Is it safe ? Is it allright ?
Wait peter is getting meaner to miles and he also has the symbiot which makes him black 💀
Arkham time! With all of his critiques about this I can tell he will love Arkham. Especially City and Knight
Kraven last word 😂
I will take NO Spider-Man 2 slander here
Do a platinum video
Has Zanny played DMC 5?  After he was talking about the combos it made me think of that game.  Great combo potential in that one and funny story, it would make a great video.
Shit woke game. Fuck insomniac.
Every single time a new zanny video drops you already know that the title and the cover are going to be perfect
Zanny reminds me of a modern day The Gaming Lemon
Venom on a bicycle. Game of the year 😂😂😂
Why the Genshin shade 🤣🤣🤣
Tanalorr is mine
@theonlyzanny I just wanted to ask but could you do the new lords of the fallen
1:18 💀💀💀
3:06 this is why we love you zanny, unmatched comedy man
1:05 The force Unleashed was one of my childhood fav. games because there wa ssomany sick combos you could do, same with the second, although i liked more the first one.
Yes Sir Zannyy. I admire your courage to speak up about the terrible lack of innovation in these games bcoz honestly the fanbois dont take criticism lightly. They reject the PS games which try to do something new and want more and more of just spiderman or Kratos.
bro too many spoilers
Miles uploads thousands of dog videos to Fido. MJ adopts Fido in a side quest later in the story.  What did Insomniac mean by this?
18:53 What the actual f*ck??? XDXD
The girlfriend boss fight is the hardest fight so far just like real life
I'm so surprised there wasn't a "strawberries" joke is this entire video
Yo the black suit spider man theme with the venom reveal 👌  Also 10th day of asking Zanny to play Shadow of Mordor
3:52 It makes atoms go hyperspace
The zan man with another banger as usual
I'm only a little disappointed in Zanny for making the Scream joke about MJ's incessant bitching in most media. My inner nerd was so hyped to see the devs do their homework and introduce one of Venom's children. Don't know, just felt it was in poor taste cause he didn't know about her in the comics likely being the case. Video was great aside from that!
6:49  “cmon miles its just a word”
Im confused if Zanny got disappointed with the game or not, but still pretty awesome video
I was waiting for oreo to ask Peter a personal question.
I know that this probably isn't the place for a comment like this, but it doesn't really seem to matter whatsoever anyways. The fact we humans have made credit cards, particle accelerators, super conductors, enough nukes to roughly destroy the earth 4 times over; yet we still haven't landed anybody on Mars has me concerned
Zanny is too pure for this world
this shit exhausting
Oh my god that troll title, chef's kiss.
3:00 Meanwhile, Victor (Doctor Doom) Von Doom.
Typical zanny cold open. Rip  Thoughts and prayers to their families.
3:52 Imagine if a Jedi used the Force to see an x-ray of your body, accelerate the particles around them,  and generate dark matter.
I'm gonna wait until it comes out on pc.    Then, I can use mods to remove all the mistakes.
Spider-Zan!!!
Yeah ponys seems to be really really impressed by floating around spastically in a city in Spider Man 64.  And it doesn't even have the rings.
I like how after the end credits scene there's nothing left to the video, just like the game!
DOC OC IS RIGBT FROM REGULAR SHOW NOW THAT YOU KNOW ITLL HAUNT YOU FOREVER
No Yeat reference at the bell part is crazy
A particle accelerator in Star Wars terms is basically that one thing in Jedi Survivor in the space station that shoots a massive lazar
7:18 you can thank mob cult trashclowns crying over "copaganda" in the first game
Cmon man, that last MJ mission was actually pretty fun imo
Loved Spiderman 2 but Zanny made me realize how dry the side content is. I disagree about the story though i like it but, wish they did put more focus into the dilemma of Peter wondering if he should kill outside of 2 minutes in another person mission
Yesssss I've been waiting for this so long and i love it
i immediately noticed the “how you like that spidey” joke
Yummy video
05:44 this man 💀💀💀
Please give me one more for honnor vid, did you see the parrys in SPIDERMAN? Imagine how "incredible" you would be
I love how every game set up a an opening villain and then bring the one of spider man top three  villains
Y’all really gotta stop showing off spider man 2 to all my Xbox players pls🙏😭
Omg those spiderman lotus references are wild
*first few seconds* Spider-man doesn't kill
Christ bless you, Zanny out here cooking the bosses bro
Wait... Why there's no Police in this game, while Police are in previous titles?
Its so hard to laugh at the video when every few seconds theres bitching
How is he wearing tobeys black suit at 5:58
He should have said," THEY FLY NOW!?" To venom when he got wings
This man has only seen Tobey as Spiderman. The spider verse doesn’t exist to Zanny…no seriously don’t let him fool you. He doesn’t love spiderman, he loves Tobey Maguire 🗿 no other spiderman has ever existed in Zannys world
20 hours game jammed into 40 minutes of video and this dude talks about rushing LMAO
Spider man 2 was my first spider man since PlayStation 2 and I got to say I’m a bit disappointed, combat and the missions are really disappointing, I was expecting a game with satisfying moves and also I was never a big fan of the “hero story where the hero always wins” like I wanted Rated R shit but I guess I had my expectations to high.
Man that guy in the wall sure was BRICKED up amiright?
zanny never disappoints
I loved playing as venom in this game buttt    Ultimate Spider-Man has the best venom gameplay for me
Glad to see you finished the game Zanny. Did you happen to finish the flame side quest? If you did what did you think about the ending?
I wonder why peter never just gave harry the anti venom suit after beating him, harry would be completely healthy with absolutely no drawbacks at all (I think) Pete doesn't need it after venom is gone so why keep it?
When miles saved harry I was screaming at the screen to tell peter to give harry the anti venom suit
Glad people are realizing how disappointing this game is  Seriously wtf, the story is so goddamn stale (like everything else)
i agree with the combos thing
I like how zanny proves how you can still like this game while giving it a fair share of criticisms. The quality of side missions is all over the place which kinda suck but when they work maaaaaaan do they work
The blind lady is the chick from Deadpool
21:03  the third one is the best alternative color of the suit.
Norman: What are you writing?  Otto: The final chapter. Zanny: Can the final chapter have more significant gameplay changes? QUICK! GET THE BELL! HE ATILL HAS THE SYMBIOTE IN HIM!
Talking hardware when shreks box is barely running fast travel simulator
24:07 omg symbiote didn't take over when zanny criticized the game, we were lied to
Alright next video is arkham
Miguel get this bitch is crazy
18:33 he has downloaded the walls move set.
Please play Baldurs Gate 3. You would love it!
You want combos play we of shadows if you haven't
"I want more combos." Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon veterans: 👁__👁
How did you like the ending to The Flame missions with that teaser for the OTHER big name Symbiote baddie?
Why does Oreo/Mr. Negative looks like an Asian Markiplier?
When r6
“Your about to feel 3 inches of Me”  Best line of this video
No lie I was just re watching the first Spider-Man 2 vid and this one came out what a blessing
i also had the light bug at the exact same location
Yea ganke sucks
Oh my god he’s gonna love the Arkham games.
Kraven Kravenoff, in the Russian tradition they inherited from the vikings any last name ending in off/ov for men and ova for women literally means son of/daughter of. So Kraven Kravenoff is Kraven son of Kraven, or Kraven Jr. for short
As the sonyers would say "goty"
A Particle accelerator, in Star Wars terms: 2 Death Stars point their lasers at each other and fire at the same time time to see what happens when the lasers hit each other.
22:15 Brought to you by the King on Black himself.  *THINK I'M JOKING!? LOOK AT THE SYMBOL ON VENOM'S MINIONS!*
Bro switched his personality through the wall 😂
"The hardest boss fight was the girlfriend"😅😅😅😅😅
I can’t tell if this video is a Fat W or a Massive L
Complains about gameplay clearly never played Arkham games. Still love you zanny boy
11:56 sorry, i lost my shit here 😂
Whilst I agree some more complexity to combat would be nice i can’t get over how my guys saying that then dying to the “see blue less O attack”
The hailey mission was stupid The game is anti cop MJaw mission is stupid Gay homecoming was cringed      Sorry the symbiote effects
"We are going to heal the World"  "How?"  *dramatic pause...   "Planet Venom"
I can understand the criticism. I finished the story and all the side content in just 28 hours. Although I had a great time with the game, it was way too short.
"Thats like using a shotgun for a haircut" Kurt cobain moment
And now we wait for Spiderman the third
Particle Accelerators make some super duper small things go super duper fast.  I know, it's very complicated.
Venom could never survive animal crossing
Nice
18:06 I had so mych hope for the "synergy" joke
Game companies really cut back on play testers to nothing.
If zanny wants a game that has a venom ish feel to it then he should definitely play prototype
Me watching zanny instead of doing duolingo
"your free to go.. TO HELL"  That was a hella "cold" line.
"you're free to go... TO HELL!!!" had me fucking cracking up for a second lmao
Bsasically it uses a machine to make midichlorians light speed travel
4:01 NO YOU SKIPPED IT!! "I'm fresh out of honey" it'S GONE
13:00 every destiny 2 boss battle
Such a bad game 0/10
But what about Tanalor?
You should try out Ultimate Spider-Man, if you like playing Venom
Peter just has the symbyote so he can be black and call miles the n word
One thing I fail to understand is why dont they give unconscious harry the Anti-Venom suit? Y'know, the one known to cure illnesses out of its hosts? Are they stupid? Am I stupid?
I can’t even explain how funny zanny is i just always laugh my ass off
The symbiote told me to say that it was disappointing how their were no bases like in the first game with the demons or king pins men. But that’s just the symbiote talking
Unfortunately they replaced the cops with firefighters in this game because Twitter would have another meltdown if the former were in it.
21:04 I didn't know we were playing fortnite
6:49 this Spider-man doesn't need symbiote to be really mean
This is like the third or fourth time I've heard the phrase _"19" of Venom"_ so I (foolishly) looked up the origin.  I was expecting that one Gwen Stacy video, but no. It's so much worse.
WAIT THATS NO BUG , ITS THE BRIGHT YELLOW PONCHO
This editing is SO foul 💀💀
This was maybe the funniest video I've seen recently. Zanny's humour is evolving in all the best ways.
Im proud zanny didnt make a single cum man joke
no puppy break is a heart breaker
Particle accelerator go boom
when's the next Deep Rock Galactic video
They deliberately left the police out of this game for reasons that you portrayed pretty well with that Miles joke. The 2018 game's police-worship has aged very poorly and makes me cringe on replays. Though I do agree that not having them show up for crimes is overcompensating and just feels empty. The police would be there for crimes like that, portraying that fact isn't glorifying the bastards.  And yeah I totally agree that the side content feels too repetitive. You make fun of the Hailey mission but I actually really enjoyed that one just because it was unique (and Hailey got some more character, and the use of emoji-like icons in place of narration to represent her thoughts was creative). Wouldn't want a whole game of that or anything but it was a fun little distraction. Same goes for the missions where you play as younger Peter.
This video title is gold hahaha
The most fit quote for reacting to Zanny's critiques is  "HEHEHEHEHEHE.. HEHADHSJHFJF.. You serious?" -JJJ
22:03 NEVERMIND HE’S GETTING THE 19 INCHES
w takes this gaem is the biggest piece of doggy dodo
Is that the Amber Heard boss fight?
Black suit not having the venom properties makes me laugh
Dude really puts an adhd trap in his video during the merch part so people dont skip it💀😂😂😂  nice one lol
NOW IT'S TIME FOR ARKHAM BOYS
PETER CAN’T STOP GETTING CUCKED WTF 18:59
Now it is time
Spoodermon
Oh combat eh. DEVIL MAY CRY V. Why haven’t you played devil may cry five
i have no brain cells after this zanny ty the dog in 5:00 is my dog and yes spiderman is a child he will be fineeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I feel so bad for Zanny, the highest story beat all ruined because Peter couldn’t get out of a tree
“It’s not a bug, it’s a Bethesda reference” had me on the floor laughing
Zanny seing venom be like  I can fix him
combat was real fun when I was focusing on staying airborne as long as possible
The writers of these game were paid for writing this.
This video was so intense that there was no puppy brake...
Symbiote peters weakness is yeat
Long and veiny😫😉😏😏
More battlefront 2
It's true that even with all the amazing stuff and action in the game, I feel they really got lazy on some stuff like the combat. Less gadgets, no new combo or finishing move... oh but we can parry now and theres attack we need to either parry or dodge. Woo.
it's 7,5/10... very very outdated open world game
“No wonder your family left you” is fucking WILD
Zanny Time
I enjoyed both the first spiderman games start to finish but in this game im honestly feel like im forcing myself to play. Its just spam square until the game tells you the input to one of your abilities
Hey spider fans, ring that subscribe bell to defeat venom! -Developers or something
It's kinda hilarious that there are no cops.  I mean we all know why, but you get put onto the naughty list if you say it out loud...
I appreciate that you took the time to critically analyze the game from a gameplay perspective. Brilliant but lazy pretty much sums up this game. There are brilliant moments such as venom/the symbiote suit in a sea of lazy side content and stale combat.
the first game had SOOOOO many side quests and so many things to do. the new game kinda feels very lack luster. story is amazing and the game feels perfect, but the lack of missions and how fast I completed it was lame. i got 100% with like only 15 hours in the game. 70 bucks for 15 hours of gameplay is pretty shitty
Tbh the whole “just spamming one button” is kinda backwards cuz abilities, and gadgets all provide valuable uses in combat and in boss fights and the combo game is really in depth. You just didn’t try to pull of insane combos which was probably why you thought the gameplay was one sided. But hey, we’re all entitled to our own opinions
"Your about to feel 3 inches of me!"  Me: "SHES ONLY 12!!!"
If you wanted to play as venom more you could try ultimate spider-man. half the game is playing as venom and its a peak game from my childhood
I recommend The Mad Max game one of the best post-apo. games I have played it has day and night, vehicle combat is insane. Just a man and his machine in the desert
They removed cops from the game and replaced them with the firefighters because there is a lot of people that hates cops . Like... wtf? 🤦
just because you can finish off these fights with smashing square doesnt mean you should. its reinforced that you use air combat as it is way more effective, you can use his many moves as "combos". and of course leads to better gameplay. of course i wouldnt say no to more depth to the gameplay, the removal of most of the gadgets and the removal of suit powers especially is very dumb, but they wanted the symbiote to have an effect on Peter.
22:53 Wait, wasn’t that like 6 different buttons?!
Respect to the symbiote for releasing the FACTS
"This is my childhood dream, playing as Venom" Ultimate Spider-Man vídeo when???!
The title cracked me up hard. So much better suited to the star wars survivor tho.
Symbiote Zanny spitting facts saying the problems of the game that some people deny that exists
For how long they worked on this game, It's impressive how good it turned out. even if it's not perfect by any means.
6:48 surely he wouldn’t call Miles anything bad
I kinda get what you’re saying about the repeativness, but all the side missions plays differently.   Also I’m not sure about the just mashing square when that’s every game 😂😂
miles evolved suit look like garbage bruh wtf man
Zanny. The game does have combos you just don’t do em.
“Gonna cry?”
actually well thought out critcisms and praises, 10/10 review honestly.
Hey Zanny i don't know if you're a comic guy but if you liked the Venom parts of the story I'd recommend you read Donny Cates's Venom run.
where puppy break?
And I finished spiderman 2 before you even posted the video lol
22:02 Peter about to get all 19 inches of Venom whether he wants it or not.
Japan line was so good. I laugh my ass about that
Hey Zanny! Try Devil May Cry 5 I'm begging you.
Legend says that if they make a 4th tobey movie, zanny will unlock his symbiote suit
A particle accelerator is like doing a holdo maneuver in a circle
If you have a problem with the combat. Get your self a fucking job and be a game developer
Probably no one will notice this comment while scrolling down but here's a fun fact: Tony Todd is the voice actor for Venom, who also voices The Fallen, Darkseid and Zoom
Y'know the fact the flashbang bug lights spiderman's entire body up while  NPCs only light up where skin is visible means, technically, spiderman is naked...
HONEY WAKE UP ZANNY POSTED A SPIDER-MAN VIDEO    (She isnt real)
Scream is an established character in the comics. She is one of Venom's many children.  And the Venom with wings thing is a recent thing that happened in comics. He learned how to do it when he fought the God of the Symbiotes.
7:19 has rare footage of a not-white person complaining about the lack of cops
there was no puppy break :(
I guess it’s time for the Batman Arkham series 😏pls
I think they got rid of cops in this game because game "journalists" complain that Spider-Man shouldn't work with cops and they hated the Spider-Cop jokes apparently. So police radio dispatch is replaced with the Friendly Neighborhood app and Yuri became Wraith, I know that there is a story reason too in the DLCs of the first game but I believe that's also why she became Wraith. Even if you don't interact with them in Mile Morales game, at least they were there.
i know you won't listen to me but you should check out ultimate spider man, it's old and small game but it let's you play as venom so
shes getting the 19 inches 😂😂😂
I love it when she start kravinoff my kravin 😩
Zanny you should try the dmc francshise its real good
7:03
Zanny’s Spider-Man expectations before and after Elden Ring 😂
I'm dissapointed with the lack of a active day/night cycle too. Old Spider-Man 2 on PS2/Xbox had it, Halo Infinite's Campaign has it, really a bummer that it's rare to see in modern open world games nowadays. Also Zanny, if you want another Spidey Game that lets you play as Venom, I recommend the old Ultimate Spider-Man game. It lets you rampage in the open world as Venom after beating story mode, with a increasing wanted level that leads to S.H.I.E.L.D being involved.
Lord Zanny please for the love of god try Witcher 3, its fantastic
People these days cant find a bug without crying on youtube about it, sad kids should be happy they are fixable, back when live service wasn't a thing you had to endure bugs. TL;DR bugs aren't new people are just spoiled now
My only gripe about the game is the same that I had with Miles' game. Wayyyy overpriced for a sub-10 hr story, reskinned enemies, some slightly new abilities and a bit of extension to the map. Game's worth maybe $50 max.
Bro really came out with the japan reference
"hit confirmed" got me dying
I personally dont mind miles' endgame suit i like the variants of it more than the original but i think its cool and good on them for making something original
At 0:20 what is the ac game?
Play spider man 3 the one with Toby and venom
Why can i use picture in picture with zannys channel but not anyone else?
7:06 strawberry’s
The third act made this whole game
I think what angers me most about the last miles suit being a product placement is that they didn’t need it. I would understand if a game studio had less of a budget or if the game was not looking to be a guaranteed success, but this is the sequel to Marvels Spider-man, one of playstation’s most successful and praised games ever! There was going ti be a profit regardless, so this felt like such a selfish move made by the executives that the Devs just had to allow. AND AS THE NEW CANON SUIT?! I COULD UNDERSTAND AN UNLOCK-ABLE SUIT BUT REALLY?! I dont even think its as bad as most people say but its such a slap in the face of fans.
I love every sec of this vid.
But does the zan-man have the game plat?
11:56 "YOU'RE A FRAUD SPIDER-MAN!"
Never fail to impress Zanny ❤
Partical accelerator, in star wars terms One is a linear particle accelerator, where you have 2 jedi standing apart from each other. One forces pushes a blaster bolt away from themselves and the other force pulls it towards themselves. When the particle hits the second jedi the resultant explosion of gore has a video taken of it in about 1000 FPS 200K resolution, and people look at the video to try prove a number of theories about what midichlorians are made of, and/or come up with new theories.
Play Spiderman web of shadows zenny, best spider game, combats is so NICE, i do no way dont reve remastered
100% the whole thing already
idk which development was more rushed: this game or this video
I am 3000% convinced that Zanny's Spirit Animal is Bully Maguire
You got to love how Symbiote Peter in this game is still less evil than regular Peter in "Spider-Man: Lotus."
We all know Barry Allen is pissed off seeing a full working particle accelerator
Imagine if zanny plays baldurs gate 3 with boys that would be legendary
Spider Zanny Spider Zanny
"wait theres no sound" mf u got me
🔫🤨 watch it
The title should have been spiderman 2 but i turn into a god menice
I always love checking my YouTube feed and finding 19 inches of zanny
Carnage?
So glad that zanny didn't completely fan-boyed like all the other YouTuber with this game and gave genuine critisim which alot of people were afraid of giving just because of the woke propagandists and mindless fans who don't even like it when genuine critisim is given...
ah i miss the moment zanny played star wars the old republic it was sad to see him quit and same for me i almost cried when i quitted it (quitted today😢)
The mention of old God Of War is now making me wonder when is Zanny gonna play Devil May Cry
i love when zanny's videos come inside me
I had the glow glitch as well but only lasted a minute...thought it was the venom suit powering up or something but no, was just a lighting glitch.  Also, I remember there being a day night cycle, play long enough and the sun will set/rise
Zenny might enjoy Spider-man: Shattered Dimensions. If he can get his hands on it that is...
19:42LMAOO
Gotta admit I legit pogfaced at Scream, even though she's MJ in this game.
My hero! I look up to you greatly, sir, and strive to have even an ounce of the quality that is in your videos
I was just watching this video and my cat died
At 7:52 I suffered the same problem. Spider-Man just decided to flashbang everyone
Did anyone else not realise the daredevil one made no sense until he said it
The TITLE said it all
Thit title got me uncontrollably chuckling
As the game I can confirm he finished me  Wait
bro actually lost to the grizzly bear guy😂
what do you mean live action lizard scares the shit out of me
Not gonna lie, 19 inches of venom got me 😂
bro doesn't know who scream is.
19:08 here me out guys….
It was awesome to see your experience with the game from the beginning to the end though it surprised me with the amount of bugs you encounterd during it as i only delt with like 3? Throughout my completion of the game 😅, funny as hell though
*cough* i think we all know why there are no cops *cough* (California hates cops for those who don't know)
Mr Negative just HAD to be a bubble titan
will zanny ever play baldurs gate 3 O-O
I completely agree about how the game feels stagnant. It also mishandles the primary antagonist, totally flopping on what made that character so compelling
Scream is a Symbiote from the comics  But I definitely like your MJ joke better
❤❤❤❤
I wish zanny talked more about set pieces in this game. Amazing video as always though.
Not so fun fact: The US knew that Japan was planning on surrendering but decided to drop both nukes anyway just to show the world "who's in charge". They also targeted civilians instead of military installations.
Zanny that's one of the best video so far with the references memes twas hilarious
14:36 eyo bro what
Zanny went full schizo for this one
I for one love it when Zanny fills us all up with 19 inches of content
a particle accelerator makes very small particles (atoms and shit) go really fast, so that it collides with other small particles at super high speeds. Basically, a ton of advanced physics research involves smashing small shit together in high-energy collisions just to see what happens.  In star wars terms, imagine the holdo maneuver 🤮 but with tiny pieces of coarse, rough, irritating sand instead of a big ass ship.
That police station joke was crazy
Within an hour Mr.Zanny. Am I cool yet?
Venom on a bicycle made laugh way too much bro😊
Do more air combos and stop complaining
In star wars terms, a particle accelerator is using super tiny holdo maneuvers on something
a particle accelerator is a machine that makes particles go light speed
15:00 I don't think miles could beat Peter with the Symbiote but anyway... 16:25 Never played Ulimate Spiderman on PS2 mate? 20:40 This is just Symbiote in White, is not as the Comics (would be too OP) Miles Evolved Suit is terrible. 22:20 Well...he can now, this is new in the comics too.
Play metal gear rising
RIP Square button. Goty for sure😂
A particle eccelerator is when you have a giant circle that sends two or more particles (protons, neutrons and electrons) at light speed around the circle until they smash into each other   and that creates a new element but the element is more unstable than revenge of the sith anikin so it turns into radiation and a stable element in like 4 nano-seconds but it's cool to see the elements that are created
pov a normal day in brazil
zanny i love you (no homo) but most of the stuff at the beginning is all wrong it’s mainly about how you play the game, i never got bored of beating dudes up until they were declared brain dead, and i quite liked the musical thingy missions, the sand man things were alright not very boring if you just yeet them into water and watch them dissolve.
Mabuhay ka, Zanny!
underwhelming I hope you care more for the arkham games, they're far better
you finished spider man 2! now where is the destiny vid zanny
Uh actually it’s not a bug, it’s an arachnid 🤓
Bg 3 is goty 😂
Bro thinks he's doctor strange 18:33
This first part is an edit because I want to start by saying that I don’t mean to be rude to Zanny or people who have a similar problem with the combat of the game, but in my opinion there are two ways to fight enemies.   Option 1: use the gadgets to group enemies together and make them vulnerable for your combos, then hit enemies in the air and dispatch them with a large list of attacks and use powerful abilities to take out large groups.  Option 2: spam and complain   I do think there’s a problem with the Spider-Man combat, but Zanny misdiagnosed it. In this game, Zanny said there weren’t changes to the combat, but in reality you’re supposed to play an entirely different way. That’s good. Zanny played like a monkey hitting a controller, and he still succeeded for the most part. That’s bad.   The problem isn’t that all you can do is spam like Zanny said, the problem is that spamming takes little effort and still works. It doesn’t work as well as playing the game normally, but the fact that it works is an oversight.
There's a lot of things they did great in this game... but there is also a LOT of things they did really badly in this game 😒
Just as i thought. It's basically a reskinned spiderman 1 dlc with added movements. Same as modern warfare 3 lol
Peter almost became Casca. Venom even spawned some Griffith wings. 😂
22:20 they fly now?
This shit highlight of the week
no puppy break :(
My man DOES know that there are more air moves and web yank moves that extend beyond mashing square... right?
Zanny never ceases to kidnap us and keep us trapped in his basement! ❤
is spiderman that robot dude, whathisname? conner? from become human
these jokes are swinging out of control
As flashbang man I can confirm this was me
Zanny funny as fuck for this
15:24💀💀
It’s pretty obvious how he ran out of meaningful criticism really fast.
Zanny when's the Arkham playthrough?
GIVE ME THE SYMBIOTE
Zanny is genuinely one of the funniest gamers on YouTube
19:11 well considering scream is venoms daughter id say its technically worse than that
Be careful zanny, if you criticize the game that insomniac dickrider colin might put you in a video where he strawmans all your points
22:16 new fortnite glider confirmed
Adidas is apparently a massive sponsor for Insomniac Games and asked to have their new shoes in the game
THIS is CINEMA
BABE WAKE UP I DONT CARE IF YOUR DAD IS DYING ZANNY UPLOADED
As soon as I saw that thumbnail I exploded out of joy. you never disappoint daddy zanny.
1hr GANG!🎉
Zany discovered more things in this game then ign did in a full playthrough
A particle accelerator is a hyperdrive for mediclorians. It forces mediclorians to go into hyper space to pull the Holdo Maneuver on each other.
Wait she’s going round throwing up red X’s on peoples tags? You could get ☠️ like that.. especially in New York! AND ESPECIALLY BROOKLYN 😂😂😂😂😂 WTF
Same sentiments brodie, when Kraven said "Harder" I was like "this man has a kink" and to me that was putangina LMAO
You know that thing that 100% of players hated in original game that served no porpuse other then make players suffer? Well, now there is 5 times more of it! (c) Design director of Spider Man 2
She just got her 19 inches of venom
WHERE IS MY PUPPY COMMERCIAL!!!!
Apparently the game is riddled with woke propaganda.. Plus I hear Miles Morales is a perfect character that needs no growth and pretty much is the one that helps Peter with all his problems because apparently Peter is pathetic now.. And I'm not even gonna mention the Scream boss fight where MJ is bitching and whining about living in a patriarchy to Peter and pathetic o'l Peter keeps apologizing for things he has no control over.. Well I guess I mentioned it..
DID NOT expect to get lit up today as a genshin player
every time someone sees that miles suit at the end:  "wtf are you wearing?"
in star wars terms it makes the atom go fast like in the movie
This game really makes you feel like Spider-Man 2
Spider Man 2 where main character is shoved aside and the game gets stolen by bla [commenter has been sent to reeducation sunshine and rainbow gulag]  Amount of cops in game has been reduced to close to zero because turbo-activist pseudo-game maybe-journalist felt threatened by cops.  Also the female writer of this has a face like a shovel and they made MJ look like her.  Welcome to clown world.
Day #1 of supporting the idea that Zanny should make an Uncharted series
Amazing video, laughed really hard at "Your about to feel 3 inches of ME"
This game hand hold alot
Thank you for the distractions my adhd would be flaring
I will forever stand by the theory that everything zanny says while playing games is just what the characters is thinking in their head.
UNO IS WORKING AGAIN
The combat doesn’t really get stale they just need to add more new animations for it thats why you gotta mix it up alot
Alright it's official zanny is just better dunky an actual review just clips of you on stream
Zanny trying not to upset marvel fanboys but still putting his thoughts lol.
MARCOOL
Btw theres no cops in the game because some peole complained the first game was "pro police"
231st comment
Please try ghost runner its a cyberpunk setting where you play as a physicaly inhanced Ninja and the second game just released you could play it on stream.
I loved when Peter Parker said “White Power” and fought Eminem. Truly Game of the Month
Where can i watch you live?  Your videos actually make my day
What is Channing Tatum doing here?? 1:57
I’m gonna put some dirt in your eye
That bathezda reference was criminal also don’t know if I spelt it right…
Is the particle accelerator gonna be the next mitochondria?
Uhh I might’ve finished Spider-Man 2 in one day….
I finished the game with a playthrough full of bugs and then the next day the patch dropped lol
1:32 bro💀💀
The city is in shambles, people are dying and everything’s on fire.  Zanny: Proceeds to get on up get himself together and drive that funky soul.
"let me play venom, let me play venom, let me play venom"   LET'S GOOOOOOO
I was literally watching your videos when I found out you just dropped
Thanks Zanny! Love your work. I can’t play the game but your videos are even better in my mind.
9:55 " Andy, Do you see  David Wallace in the room with us right now?"
8:52 i just love the idea of spidermen getting mad at miguel every time they lose a fight lmao
you know what game has combos? the bateman games... just saying...
Now is it better than armored core 6?
Have to agree that after 100%ing the game, I felt like it was kind of repetitive and not very innovative on the side content. Main story was great, but the fact that I 100%ed the game in less than 23 hours left me wanting more. Hopefully the DLC will address some of the lacking side plots
the ui in this games is ass not all of it. mainly the powers, abilities and suits slide
Zanny is ahead of us in time he is god he is universes ahead of us we need to stop him or else he will destroy all of humanity
me when i saw the city invaded by symbiotes: *"Why am i having Web of Shadows flashbacks?"* 🤩
The mitochemical is the powerhouse of the devils breath
OH MILES GET IT YOUR TURN !!! Lmao 🤣 😂😂
At 20:13 should've blurred the fingers like he was flipping him of
The booing for miles 😂
Hey Zanny play Gotham knights bro you will like it or hate it you will see why 😂😂.Great video may the memes be with you
19:42 I laughed way too hard at this XD
Zanny a bigger particle accelerator was used to destroy Alderan if that helps
A particle accelerator is when a particle decides to try spinning because it’s a cool trick
12:05 Rio was boutta bust out the chancla 💀
Zanny if you want to play as Venom again... you should give a try to Ultimate Spiderman ;D
19:43😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3:47 it's what Sony used to make this game faster jk
3:47 "guys, what the fuck is a particle accelerator?"  it's exactly what it sounds like, it accelerates particles, typically 2 at a time in opposite directions so they can smash together and break apart into the tinier particles inside them so you can use them.  3:52 "Can you explain it to me in star wars terms?"  In Star Wars terms, a particle accelerator lets you do "The Holdo Maneuver" on an atomic level except instead of a star destroyer it's a bunch of atoms and instead of Holdo's ship it's also more atoms.
The only problem I have with this game is it’s not really that original because it took a lot of inspiration from web of shadows, but I like that game still
Do you know what isn't mashing square? Baldur's gate 3!
Someone needs to make a mod of the Spiderman Lotus costume and have Peter wear it during the Miles vs Peter boss fight
spider-man 2 hate will not be tolerated.
The best way to describe a particle accelerator in star wars term is like watching the death star charge up but it has the potential of blowing up a planet not the guarantee
11:26  This line just makes Tony Todd's voice acting about 10x more terrifying. He was the best choice as Venom, cause the movie one was ass.
Under one hour gang
The moment he got blown up by the rpg literally made me laugh aloud
Man zanny always makes amazing videos keep up the good work man
One of the videos of all time
Also spiderman 2 is barely better than the last 2 which is pretty disappointing
Dahm its weird to see people have so many buggs. I have 30 hours in the game and didnt encounter a single bug. Kinda wish i would have had the power of flashbang man for comedy
Flashbang-man be like ”Gonna put some flash in your eye“
A partial  accelerator is a midichlorian enhancer
Do you know what does feel more alive? Baldur's gate 3.
The youtube goat
Even zany said that was too far 10:11
Do you know what does feel more alive? Uncharted 4, that's right, I'm joining the Uncharted guy!
I’m here
3:51 a hyperdrive in tube that goes round and the throw random shit in it to see what happens
Star Wars terms? Okay, you know the DEATH STAR? The big tunnel that the laser is guided through to blow up planets?  Like that. Kinda…. Sorta….. a little.   Like, .000000000000000001% of a Death Star.
This is the goated video of the entire channel
Better than starfield though...
A Particle accelerator, in Star Wars terms : 4 Jedi's are standing in a circle with an orb. One Jedi pushes the orb to another and that one does the same till the orb is back to the first one, and then you just repeat it till the orb is almost ligthspeed. And that's a particle accelerator in very simple Star wars terms
Zanny you should try Lies of P
The Japan line was diabolical
There is a day and night cycle
Honestly yeah i agree with some of the complaints he has but i mean they’ll be changed in some later updates especially the day night thing
A particle accelerator is a machine that makes Midichlorians go superfast. Also, we can slam them into each other for fun and spicy pictures.
I had a similar problem with the combat until I realized that I could uppercut someone then yank them back down into one of their teammates. Added some fun back into the gameplay loop for me
Sad
You really editing out the best joke of the game. I WANNA KNOW IF HE WAS FRESH OUT OF HONEY DAMN IT
Bro, I finish the game the first three days💀
Looks extremly bringt nfl
Spider-Man is for 10 year olds Zanny.  You’re 10 year old sized probably
Dude seriously needs to play Arkham. Combat, story, side content, It does everything better.
Zanny could say the craziest batshit thing and say Venom got to me
A particle accelerator does a light speed ram but with atoms and other small particles
My most anticipated video of 2 WEEKS what took you so long
Am gonna put some sauce in your eyes 9:04
24 min of zanny playing spiderman? Yes please?!
I got back to gaming cause of you on the MHW vid and got me subs.Why ngayon lang kita nakita over 40years of being a gamer this channel and the other one of yours gave me another chance in my crappy life to live for. Thank you young padawan. ❤
Zanny play devil may cry if you want some cool combat oriented games
Zanny never fails to spread my cheeks wide open and insert funny hahas inside.
Zanny never fails to fill me up with his content
I finished before this video did.
4:58 Defently just you.
Zanny which game do you think will win goty? My personal pick is baldurs gate 3, but feel free to have a different opinion. (I'll just argue with you in the replies)
ok
Ah yes my next dose of Zanny has arrived.
Zanny did you like Alan wake 2?
I like how fast zanny realized that the daredevil joke made absolutely no sense
If Zanny had released this video criticizing within the same week or 2 as the game came out there would be a bunch of comments from people within my community repeatedly saying "well I enjoyed the game it's a masterpiece"
Now you have to play batmaaaaaan
🔥🔥🔥
BOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDEEEEE!!!!!
7:32  Because you don’t know how to use the Mysterio mission exploits
was not expecting that lotus joke 💀
Always a pleasure to have my fav youtuber upload
A particle accelerator is like if a Jedi used the force to speed up and steer a blaster bolt made of particle into a cl@nker’s face.
I’m Star Wars terms a particle accelerator is kinda like that one scene in the last Jedi where they light speed ram the first order fleet but instead of doing it with forgettable characters they do it with microscopic particles
The police booing Miles had me rolling😂
Zanny you will do a Hollow Knight video on main chanel🧭🧭🧭⌚⌚⌚
Freddy fastbear
1:20 it just killed me 😂
"zanny" never fails to murder me in cold blood behind a McDonalds on the evening of September 23rd 2015
Bro when will you try avatar
Zanny plz play baldur's gate 3
0:42 Bully Mczanny
Last time I was this early on a Zanny video, *🎵the sun was a deadly lazer🎵*
In a galaxy not so far, far away, a particle accelerator in the Star Wars universe could be likened to a wacky contraption that uses the mystical force of Jedi-like particles to hurl tiny, energized droids at ludicrous speeds through a circular track, creating cosmic collisions that make lightsabers look like glow sticks at a cantina rave. With the finesse of a pod racer and the unpredictability of a Hutt's dietary preferences, this accelerator unlocks the secrets of the universe, one blaster bolt-sized proton at a time, all while making R2-D2 beep in awe. May the Force be with those poor particles!
THE KING!!!
Gotta agree with the combat complaints. Love these games but basically the same combat for three games is getting a tad stale by this point. Still love the game tho
It’s a good day when zanny uploads 🔥
The Spectacular Spiderzan
4:18 as a Genshin player, a truer statement could not have been made
How do I stop my video from lagging
You need to use air moves more if your just mashing square bouncing off and zipping to other enemy’s while you swing kick is so fun and the new moves where you can throw them higher then push them to then ground is so good so pretty much use more air combat
Great content equals zanny baldur's gate 3 video!
Peter: Hey Harry! / Harry: Yeah? / BullyMaguire: Gonna cry? Everyone laughs in the theatre 🎉🎉🎉
The game is nice but boring. Like homework
Week 91 of telling Zanny to join the viking faction in For Honor
I Just opened yt after completing  spider man 2 and I see your vid 😅
I can’t believe that you didn’t put any subway surfers next to the rest of this video. You’ve really regressed as a YouTuber Zanny.
This game I just a bit too far away to be as good as baldur's gate 3.
Bully Lowenthal is so good
Spiderman2 has finished & so have I
I COOKED US UP A FEAST 🍳 also the Evening Swan pin is leaving my store in 2 days! grab him before he escapes (FOMO) https://crowdmade.com/collections/zanny
Jus wanna say thanks man you vids are always the greatest distraction for me
That police station joke is crazyyy😭😭😭
LETS GOOO MORE SPIDER-MAN 2 FROM ZANNY😊😁
I just love the exaggerated swagger of a black teen
When will they learn that players don’t like playing as a civilians, they came for Spider-Man not normal man.😩🐱
Another awesome video from the legend himself, The Zan Man, you've grown so much man, keep it up, love every single one of your videos❤🔥💪🏼
Your about to feel 3inches of me
Zanny finished spider man 2 before I can get it😂
We saying what’s up danger with this one🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
5 minute gang
Zanny, me and the Uncharted guy are trying to get you to play amazing games!
Keep creating good videos and you have such a good community and a great personality. Good job.
Thank man, this made my day❤
zanman becomes black (the exaggerated swagger of a black teen)
One of my favourite YouTubers 😂😂
You can try baldur's gate 3
I think Spider-Man kills
Zanny never fails to rip out my spine and shoot it out a cannon.
"Harder daddy...."
1 min ago the vídeo was uploaded
Is this your pick for game of the year?
Hey zanny if you respond I will buy your merch
