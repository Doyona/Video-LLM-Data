To answer a few questions in the comments:  There should not be an apostrophe on James, because it isn’t possessive. The brand is James, the drink is gin. We may one day make a rum: James Rum. It’s James Gin for the same reason that a certain small hatchback is a Ford Fiesta, not Ford’s Fiesta.  Some people have suggested that there should always be four figures in the numbering, starting 0001. But I reduced it to three figures for the first 999 bottles so you could enjoy some significant numbers on bottles: 007, 101, 420, 666, 999, plus some others (if you spot them).  That is all.
I could absolutely forge that label, I'm talking even matching the carbon dating the ink that is laid on that specific type of paper. It would be such a simple and fun task that it's not even funny. It would be so simple and relatively cheap to replicate an IDENTICAL copy nowadays
My bottle of JMGin my bottle arrived last week in an oblong box with no padding. A miracle the bottle survived.
Bring to Canada please
Dear James May i want one but you don't ship to Europe
My bottle finally arrived, and the Gin is very nice!  I’m in the U.S. and my label says “Foreigner Version”.  What is that?
How much can he get for the burned scraps of label on eBay 😂😂😂
Looks like a bottle of mouthwash.. lol.
I'm really bummed that his pub closed...
I did and it was
Are you offering shipping to the United States????
"This is going into a museum somewhere" You gotta love James' humility
Tell me the process to established your gin business, James. 👌😊
I appreciate how plain the box is.  Having been to business school I understand the cost of crazily designed boxes.  Which I don't want to pay for when I'm just gonna throw the box away.
Thanks for the toxic poison for all the mindless plebs to drink I hope you make lots of profit from the people who are addicted to it
I would've kept the torn label bits stuck on an index card.
Where can I buy it in Europe?
Can’t believe the packaging is so weak…it’ll all about the inboxing videos..
What would be the best way to drink the gin as I tried to use Schweppes tonic water but it has sugar and citrus in it which overpowers the rest of the gins flavours as it already has sweetness and citrus flavours in the gin it's self I've been trying to find a tonic with no sweeteners or citrus but apparently they don't exist which makes no sense to me I mean if I wanted to have a carbonated drink with sugar and citrus I'd just get lemonade. I need to find a better tonic water that will give me a better tasting experience for your gin
My first thought was “You sent yourself a bottle?”
"I say "I" ... I ... I've, I've made a video about producing a Gin ..."
Looks like something from my secret lab.
Should have called it James Nips
Nice watch, anyone know what model it is
wasnt expecting that from james
If James put Lurpak spreadable butter, invented in 1901 into his Gin then it would have tested 10 times better
Where’s the gin James?? Paid my money and dpd have lost it 🤔 no reply from the email either
I have one. It's not numbers (except for a batch number 002 in my case) and it's not signed. And it wasnt in that box.
Get richard hammond in to try it
Please ship to America 🇺🇸
Has Captain Slow lost weight? looks thinner.
Do we get to choose our number? I'd like number 1300 is possible? Pleas?
Missed the opportunity to name it Gin of Bim.
I need to know why we can't get this in the States.
It's like watching the Open University and James is Denzel !!!
only james could make writing a number interesting but a 7 min task
It can't be shppied to me 😭😭😭 Also, how many cases will Richard buy?
What? No c**k on the label?
Did you say you’re “woke”?? Please don’t use that trash slang language. It’s beneath you 😒
Gin tastes horrible but I like James
Do something about the branding and the label, seriously!  It Looks like a bottle of hand sanitizer.
I'll purchase a bottle of "Captain Sloe" as and when it exists.  Maybe one day.  I don't believe that "Brummie's Ruin" ever had much mass appeal.
Mine just arrived this morning. Flippin superb
James it makes me sad to watch you. You've gone from excentric to full blown nuts.
James Gin delivery just arrived…I feel an unboxing moment is imminent
Hey, guys! Number 1378 here. Just gotten my bottle. Thanks James!
We need a tasting note from Oz Clarke
Some Jaaaaaaag driver entered an laboratry "borrow" some large size bottles, then labelled and mail to Jame May.
Why is it not called "Bim Gin"....
Will you ship to Canada? The queen should have no problem with it
I thought James May Gin, but now he has!
It looks like something you would see on a doctor’s counter
should have called it.."BIM" LOL! as per a previous episode.
Wait, so you're telling me that there are OTHER types of "WD" Oil????
I'm sold!  Where can I get one?
Being teased by James May’s Gin videos, and tormented I cannot get it to asynchronously sample with Food Tribe
Tried to put in an order, but its only available in the UK unfortunately (I live in Denmark).
James saying woke is the best thing
I'm really curious to see Clarkson and Hammond's reaction to the gin. Bottle 003.
Get TV presenter Oz Clarke to try it, you ponce.
A case to Texas, please!
It looks like you only need to take it twice in a span of 3 weeks .
I blame Clarkson for James gray hair.
My bottle arrived today,  got number 184 very happy with it. Looking forward to drinking it when I retire in 16 years
I really want to try it but i cant drink spirits without expecting a knock on the door from the old bill the next day... 😂😂
Looks like it belongs on a laboratory shelf.
👍👍👍
“Because we’re very woke” 😂😂😂
Looks like an IV bottle.
My name is James I have to have the first bottle
Yay I’m definitely gonna buy some
What watch is that james? A casio? Rare citizen?
Should be 0001 if there's four digit number of bottles. You'll have to do it all over again. Have a bottle of gin with it. ;-)
Nice! I just got 'FIFTH GEAR GIN' in the mail today! Just in time to drink it and enjoy some of James may! 😬
James gin vs diddly squat gin who will be victorious?
But James, why did you label it 001 and not 0001. 1420 Bottles is a four digit number. You should stick to this format.
I first thought ugh what a hideous bottle but it grows on you just that old classic feel
Looks like something administered to a patient in hospital haha
"makes his own gin" lol
That's him trying to go legit because he is lowkey a part of the peaky blinders
You do understand that you are required to order two if you are a Gentleman. You drink one with close mates and family, and keep the other to collect dust on the shelf.
The numbering system should be four-digits long given the total run of this batch is 1420. For example: you numbered the first bottle 001 - this should have been 0001. Otherwise, what's stopping someone putting a 1 in front of your 001 - making it bottle 1001? :)
What is the background music?
Aww can't order to US...
wonder if it makes you waffle on like James ?
Looks very generic. Like a basic bottle with a stick generic.
I like the fact that the base of the bottle has a punt in it. Will they all be like that? I'm looking forwards to getting mine, though I suspect, quite strongly, that the other denizens of my house, will 'help' me to drink it. Possibly a lot of 'help', too.
We need Hammond to make his famous gin and tonic with it for an endorsement.  Is there a James tonic to perfectly compliment the James gin in the works?
Just Wondering.... Are You Selling Knitting Needles
UK only, Nice..
If JG01 is the first formulation is the same way as WD40 is the 40th, does that mean James put approximately zero effort in and went with the first attempt.
Hey James... When is worldwide shipping going to be available?
Ours has just arrived! We’re going in even though it’s a work night!!! It’s deeeeeeeeeliiiiiiiiicious. Hic. Love from Spam Plate Lady 😊
I hope for an international sale, please oh please
How does nobody mention that it is 1 "420" bottles? May you memester
when can you shipping to Sweden
Yo love that watch 🔥
COVID gel!
Would love to buy the Gin, but how to get it in USA?
How does "bottle 001" differ from "bottle 002" or "bottle 0267"?
