He was such. A great drummer I’m 41 played since 4?my twins 7 yo play first show was the foos they still do not no . And I didn’t tell them this summer we would see them again , ugh
I hope. Roger and Brian can play at the viewing and maybe first show . They need to go back on stage to heal , I understand time heals all .
Portnoy or barker I would love to see step in
Triple vaxxed? Like my bro, died at 45 3 months ago. R.I.P.
Good thing he was double jabbed
Funny these dorks OD on drugs while pushing and forcing vaccines...  comical
Double vaccinated and triple boosted....  Seems like a good idea 😉
rip, but don't do drugs kids
Don't know why this affected me.  It's been so long since we've experienced the death of a rock person.  Condolences to the band and his family.  He seemed to be very sweet and actually happy.  Who knows what people are feeling.
🙏💐 RIP 💐🙏
Rest well Taylor x
Junkie
You already know exactly what it was. The “safe and effective” medical product.
R.I.P one of the greatest drummers of all time,you will be missed by all
Noo so sad to learn about his passing I'll watch their vids in memory of so sad 😞
RIP Taylor!
Drugs man…..they’re a motherfucker.
🥺 r.i.p.
RIP Taylor. What a GREAT GREAT guy. We will sorely miss your beautiful soul and amazing musicianship… but did you watch his last performance in Chile? He sure wasn’t playing or singing like a guy strung out on drugs… He called an ambulance for “chest pains”-wouldn’t that be myocarditis caused by the jab? Bob Saget, Betty White, Hank Aaron, Foo’s Stage Mgr. Andy Pollard, the rest.. it’s time for people to WAKE THE F*CK UP
I still can't believe he is gone..
I learned about Taylor Hawkins passing a few days ago I was completely surprised and Devastated  I still can’t get over the fact that Taylor Hawkins is no longer with us Rest In Peace Taylor Hawkins we all miss you so much 😢😢😢
Very sad, Taylor RIP
If he was born in 1972 he's not 50 , sad news
Just another dead  junkie. When will people Learn.
He shouldn't have been doing drugs at his age,.......nobody to blame but Hawkins.
Was he also lefthanded?
So tragic and sad. Such an awesome drummer and all round good guy. RIP Taylor. You’ll be missed so much 😔
I just can’t get my head round it, so sad Taylor’s wife kids and band mates must be so devastated RIP Mr Hawkins you’ll always be loved x
When you die the real you( the spirit inside your body) either goes to Heaven or hell. Going to either path depends on if you accepted or you rejected Jesus Christ as the savior.   Heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it’s full of joy.   Hell is very terrible and it’s very very hot, you can’t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don’t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed, The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity, Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever. Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) “And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”   Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.    So how to get salvation and be on your way to heaven?   First thing first; Believing at Jesus Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Jesus Christ will send you the wrong direction.   Hebrews 10:4, 10  For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.   No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.   Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now, that way you will receive salvation and be on your way to heaven during rapture or after death.   After believing at Jesus Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.   Romans 6:10-11  For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.   As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.   Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
How is the tragic and untimely? He was a raging drug addict. The foo fighter guys, especially Dave Grohl. he knew all about this because he used to do drugs with him before he got clean. And we all know for a god-given fact that when you are a drug addict one of three things is going to happen one you're going to end up in prison two you're going to end up putting somethin in your mouth for your fix or three you're going to die. We all know this. What's unfortunate about this is that they had a chance to do something about it, and they decided to turn a blind eye and let it happen. So, Dave, YOU are partially to blame for this. Are you responsible? No. But you are definitely accountable.
He took the MRNA CLOT SHOT RIGHT?  It’s happening don’t you see?  Wake up!!!
Damn Taylor .....can't believe you're gone, u were one of the coolest and one of the best drummers i' ve ever seen.!R.I.P. # I'm gonna miss u.💔✌
Almost surreal to think about him being gone. You just don't expect this kind of news for another 20+ years. Rest in Peace Taylor
jibby jab
Death by vaccine
This is awful news, 50 years is far to young. I had somehow viewed him as a kind of ‘fitness drummer’ if that makes any sense. I mean “no surely not Taylor Hawkins.”
And this kids, is why you should never do drugs, good riddance to bad rubbish
I feel like a piece of me has died. Love you Taylor!
very sad...wish there was not the drugs to let these people go too early,  the coma in early 2000s did not teach anything ...so sad
Did he take the Bill Gates "jab"? Is the question
RIP, Taylor  the media needs to leave his widow  & family  to there grief.  It should  be private  how he died.
Rest in peace Taylor
If there’s one thing you can do in the Menory of Taylor it can be to see to it anyone around you in the age group born 1971-72 make them aware by any means to get fully health screened age sneaked up on. Us time flys
Very Sad news ..RIP brother
To his family, God Bless U All , And My Condolences 💐 To U All !!!!!! He was an awesome 😎 dude, and being with good bands, and such A Damn Good Looking Young Man!!! RIP Man!!! Bang Ur Drums In Heaven and Use Ur Beautiful Voice!!!! I Love ❤️ U Friend!!
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Don’t do drugs kids.
So sad, what a legend.  A legend performing with a legend. To many major talents are being lost and no one is coming around to replace them. I fear for the music industry.     Side note, reports are saying he had drugs in his system. Wait for official reports to come out people, news flows quicker than facts do. Also reporting his heart was enlarged, some are blaming that on the covid vaccination... wait for facts people. Unfortunately we never get them though....  Music is such an important escape for so many people.  I fear for the music industry.....
Oliver was found deceased in his room. Overdose, huh? I suspect foul play, murder by fentanyl. Put him in the file with Prince
RIP Taylor. 🙏
Well said! Nuff said. I'm heartbroken. RIP, Taylor Hawkins.
THIS  is *SO* sad....what a  SMILE he had....and such ICONIC & powerful drumming style!  My sympathies to ALL who knew him!  BIG loss to rock n' roll!
When you attend one too many Clinton kiddie parties....
One less liberal Trump hating dope head
I mean I guess it’s time to stop doing multiple drugs when you have a wife and kids.
I am very sorry to hear about his passing. My thoughts and prayers to his family and to the Foo Fighters. 50 is too young to leave. RIP Taylor.
Toxicology report was awful. So sad.
Go watch Spinal Tap, drummer always dies.
God damn it!  Another Drummer dead, Nathan Jordison, Taylor Hawkins... what the fuck man.  This is  just...
WTH????? Not for nothing.....but he did complain of chest pains.  I never thought he would do drugs.  I thought he was clean and I will believe that till that information is different.  Remember how Bob Saget died?  Just grasping at straws.  😥😥😥
what the fuck :(
Irreplaceable loss
So Sad to hear about Taylor RIP....Fort Worth born
Having 666 on your drumkit is not a good move.  Ephesians 6 12:  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
He had 10 chemicals in his body. Heart gave out. Chest pains, shortness of breath etc. DOA at the hospital.
10 abusive substances found in his body. What a good example to his young fans!!!
Still think somehow I will wake up from this nightmare… I saw him play last year in CT. Was planing on taking my kids to see them this summer in NY for their first ever concert. Just feel horrible for the family but most of all Dave. Taylor and him had a special bond.
Still think somehow I will wake up from this nightmare…
R.I.P. Taylor Hawkins. FF won’t be the same without you man.🌙💫⚡️✨🌟✨🌙
I had no idea that he had a substance abuse issues. I'm gonna miss him.
Just say no kids
Saw the Foos in Newcastle upon Tyne on the one by one tour he was Great RIP ROCKSTAR!!!!!! Cool Dude!!!!!!! And very very good Drummer!!!!!
yeah he was a great musician,  but I refuse to feel bad for people who throw their life away with drugs.
Taylor hawkins love Nickelback
Being a certain age, my generation has lost many talented musicians and singers due to a toxic cocktail of drugs. Sad, and totally unnecessary.
Vax, rest in peace kid
Yet another death bringing tears to my eyes.
Sudden death is happening so much!?? Weird stuff!???
So sad I really hope he hadn’t been jabbed!? How can it happen a healthy, young man!!??
Sadly,he is the weak in society and they just die.Drugs just too much for him to say no.
Fuckn terrible news. Speaking from experience. The worst thing about getting old is seeing everyone pass that you grow up with and the people that create things you love leave too soon. That's why parents hold onto their kids so hard. They keep us going for sure
Clot shot. Absolutely tragic
Addiction kills
My heart is broken.
R.I.P Taylor
Irreplaceable loss
Where was everyone when Taylor was putting at least 10 "substances" into his system?  No red flags?
oh no big deal, the guy was mediocre I'm sorry who gives a fuck
He was proud of taking the vaccine, and the Foo Fighters hosted the worlds first 100percent , vaccinated concert.
Heart breaking. Rest in power Taylor.
Fahkn drugs took him, man. Damn.
Hmmm...  I didn't know "Columbia" was is South America.  I must have missed that day in arithmetic.  LMAO.
Do the foo fighters keep going or is it the end like rush ?
A nice a little Guy 🥲👍 A heaven with a Keith moon RiP.. Taylor
Good bye to rubbish
Good more  to die
“Chest pain” 😑🙄
First Joey of Slipknot now Taylor wtf smh
Serve him right for give £ millions on drugs to evil drug dealers.
Devastated R.I.P
Rest in peace
Can’t shake this feeling! I am so heartbroken!
RIP Taylor, u'll b dearly missed
I’m a complete puddle hearing this news. My prayers are with his family and the Foo Fighters family. We’ve experienced a great loss…hope he is banging away in heaven today.
He didn’t pass away he died of a drug overdose
Omg 😳 that’s insane very sad to wake up to this terrible news
Can’t help but be reminded of Layne Staley now… Nutshell
Damn, life's fragile. Gutted that some people can't be around anymore. Times precious. No war hate or harm x
After chester died I never gonna hear linkin park again and now taylor hawkins such a great guy and a good drummer I'm worried about Foo Fighters. My condolences to Foos and Taylor's family.
R.I.P 😭
RIP Taylor; you’re up there singing with Kurt now!  Rock On Brother🙏♥️🪅🤟
Porque muitos cantores de rock n roll perdem a vida para as drogas assim?? Deus é o nosso socorro e fortaleza, socorro bem presente na angústia. Se você está preso em algum vício de drogas saiba que Deus pode te ajudar. É muito triste ver alguém ir embora assim.
Foo Fighters is my favorite band. This tore me apart. Taylor is irreplaceable. Dave is an awesome drummer but I wouldn’t want any other drummer but Taylor on that stage with them. Miss you, Taylor.
He was just on Stern. WTF?!
just say no.
Drugs is my guess. So sad.
RIP TAYLOR.
Fuck Fuck Fuck not another one! This is devastating Dave and the Foo Fighters Family my deepest condolences ! RIP Taylor
(R.I.P.) Taylor Hawkins.
Terrible news
Great musician, horrible that he died.  I've liked the Foo Fighters since the 90s.  I wish folks would stop doing dangerous drugs. Stick to marijuana, it won't kill you.
He was 50jears  Michael Jackson was 50 jears R. I. P.
Was he fully vaccinated?
Fully injected…yup🤦🏼
It’s always the good guys who go first My condolences to family and friends
RIP. Wasn't a big fan but I know they did some really good work.
So many healthy people just seem to be dropping dead lately for no apparent reason. Absolute tragedy and we'll never be told the truth, but I think most of us know why
Most likely from the vaccinations.
Rock On Taylor!!!!
triple vaxxed? sorry to hear his dead.. but for all those triple or quadruple vaxxed? .. the parties just beginning..
Seemed like such a kind, fun man. May God bless his family. He's with Jesus Christ now and all the tears and pain have been washed away.
Ne touchez pas à la drogue les enfants , c'est mal , m'voyez !
Breaking news they made their money shilling a drug addict attitude to teenagers. I was a teenage heroin addict, Im clean now 15+ years  no help from this guys music.  You morons think drug addicts are gods now hes dead.
I can't believe this. I'm absolutely gutted. His poor family, his band, fuck. Don't go so soon brother.
My man was high on marijuana
He overdosed. That’s suicide. Self inflicted.
RIP Taylor man, I just hope I can jam with him on the other side, I look up to you and love you man, fuck, RIP Taylor man, fuck
Damn... I bet Dave is taking it harder than the rest of the band. Them 2 were pretty close.
WTF? Unbelievable
So sad, benzos and opioids were found in his blood and urine.
He was so young!😳 What a shame! I bet his legacy will live on for so many!🎼🎶🎵🥁👏🎧🎤🎸🎭🌹❤️👍‼️
Right after he got boosted. 💉
He didn't 'pass away'...old grannies do that. He died from blood clots that stopped his heart because he was a Covidiot who fell for the C19 lies, embracing the population reduction vaccine, as if it wouldn't take him out too, which it did.
Yes, life as a millionaire is so depressing that you have to go through life all drugged up. Another Biden voter bites it.  Oh well, drummer's are a dime a dozen. I do feel bad for the guys children. They have to grow up knowing dad was selfish.
Dont feel sorry for junkies
Well, drugs will do that to you.
I’m so sad about this. RIP Taylor
Gone too soon. So very sad.
It was really rough loosing Neil Peart the other year. Hit me hard. I am not as much of a direct Hawkins fan (but still a fan), but loosing Taylor is just tragic. Way too young. He had such an infectious energy...
He was to the  Foo Fighters as Jon Bonham  was to Led Zeppelin.
Utterly incomprehensible that such a talent a gift of a drummer a legend in his own lifetime is gone way too soon, cannot fathom this loss. 😥😥 Peace&love to his family and friends. rip Taylor dude ✌️💜😥
I’d be willing to bet it’s going to come out his heart failed due to clotting caused by the jab.
another druggie grunger?
Dude was Sacrificed. We shall see whom the Chosen Replacement is . They are Satan Worshippers
WOW! Terrible news. He made a name for himself for sure. R.I.P.
Rock n Roller Taylor Hawkins RIP condolences to Family and Foo Fighters.
So which record did they let him play on? None? Ok
Ah fuck, that's what happens when drugs... kinda shit tbh because he was such a cool dude.
*BOB SAGET 2022: Hotel death* *TAYLOR HAWKINS 2022: Hotel death*
I don't even listen to foo fighters, but loved playing them on rock band and guitar hero, during my middle school years, after finding my love for rock and metal, because of the drumming.   When I think of foo fighters, I instantly think of the drummer.  This isn't suppose to hit hard like this, dang.
sad
Rope by foo fighters was the first song I ever learnt to play on the drums. I had just begun to play drums and rope was the coolest song I could think of. It took me an entire month to learn that song but I did learn it because I wanted to be a cool drummer like Taylor. RIP Mr. Hawkins. You'll always be my favourite drummer
Dave strikes again...
So very sad
rip Taylor
A very sad fact: I am an ordinary girl and I shoot good content, but I see that no one notices me. God bless those who noticed me. L
At least he became a movie star before his death. They just put out the movie Studio 666.
Irreplaceable loss
Many people have suffered heart swelling and heart populations after getting vaccine boosters,   the drugs found in his system were not the kind of drugs you die from, THC and anti depressants,   locals say it was a heart attack,.. we need to know if he took the vaccine booster recently ,, or it could have been an run of the mill heart attack we see in 50 year old men all the time
Another vaccine death?
well he wasn't that good of a drummer, because his drumming was not good enough for the records, as Dave did all the drumming in the studio
Irreplaceable loss
RIP Taylor❤️.
🕯🎵🎶🕯
Damn that 4th booster.
Loveyou Man! 😇😢
Rest in peace my dad loved too fighters
Triple jabbed. So sad. RiP🙏
Drugs killed Kurt now they kill him too
😭
When one messes on with drugs there will be one outcome death.  Silly man.
fuuuuuck. rest in power.
Quel tristesse repause en paix..mais la haut continue les concerts avec les autres musiciens pour que l univers vibre du rock .🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤👍❤
nah men...   :(
This is so hard for me, I haven't really experienced anything like this.  Sure it's sad when any legend passes but Taylor was so young and the Foos are on top of the world, probably the biggest rock band on earth right now.  I remember being bummed when we lost Chester and Chris Cornell but this one hurts way more to me.  Man I'm really genuinely sad.  I cannot begin to fathom how his family must be handling this and Dave too.  Fuck me, I hope he's ok.  Based on every interview I've seen they may as well have been twin brothers.
Sometimes god takes the good ones early for a reason...   a reason we may not understand until our time comes
Poor thing .another person who trusted Dave is dead
Here they say altitude but everywhere else they say he had 10 different substances, Hollyweird doesnt want to tell the truth as always
Shouldn't have gotten the shots. Damn. Another one down. Sorry bastard.
If everything could ever feel this real forever If anything could ever be this good again The only thing I'll ever ask of you You've got to promise not to stop when I say when RIP Taylor!!! 😞😞😞😞
The marvelous cereal commercially complain because printer collectively saw next a troubled lightning. able, undesirable greek
so sad !!! rest in peace Taylor . :'(
Drugs are bad, m’kay?
I just seen the band on the Jimmy Kimmel show  a few nights  ago., then heard this guy had died. Couldn't  believe  it. We never know  , here  one minute  , gone the next. Love one another. Rest in peace  Taylor.  Rock on.
How many legends have we lost in a hotel room? This is so tragic man. RIP
Damn - I loved this man. Soooo sad. RIP Taylor.
Rest In Peace Taylor Hawkins
Drugz
I feel bad for his family and also Dave Grohl. First he lost Kurt and now Taylor
This is sad bro he was my 1# favorite drummer sad that he passed away
I just saw him five days ago in Buenos Aires, i can't believe it
Damn this so sad, rest in peace Taylor
Seeking views from his death. Pathetic
The drugs were playing the drums. He just sat and watched.
So sad 😞 He was a badass drummer/musician! He will be missed! Prayers to his family and friends! RIP Taylor 😥
Rest in peace Taylor Hawkins !! God bless
So sad, I wonder if he was fully vaccinated and that had anything to do with his death. Ambulance was responding to man with chest pain. RIP.
his hands were made to give strength to the world of rock he was and will continue to be one of the bacterium bands in the world he was blessed by Queen Nivada and many groups his charisma of loving his bacterium made him universal now he is with the best of the best groups musicals never left because it continues and continues among us and a legend to history💕🌎
I was never a fan but RIP.  I hope Dave feels the greatest shame and guilt for making Taylor and the rest of the band get the jab.
I saw Studio 666 was funny to see Taylor as the logical let’s get out of here guy, drum in peace
Screw the band , PRAYERS T0 HIS FAM AND HIS SWEET KIDS
R.I.P Taylor Hawkins, Sending love and good vibes out to his family and the Foo Fighters. This could be a wake-up call for all of us in these trying times. Check on your family, friends, loved ones, co-workers... make sure they are okay. Mental Health isn't a joke and we should all look out for one another and ourselves. (Sorry if it sounds like I'm being judgy but I'm not trying to be).
So sad😪
Is it just me or do you ever feel like something genuinely creepy might be going on inside hotels? Like the people who work there have no genuine control or idea who is walking in and out to start, and now people who check in with a phone can get a room easier than the front desk. They can’t guarantee you the top floor but an app will unlock it for full price without having a key. People walking on the roof at 3am- they are fixing something? What and why? Oh you mean they just told you that bc they had no idea either?   Ever been stalked by a neighbor? The guy who blasts smooth Jazz from Kenny G every morning? You know the psycho SJW 70 year old who hires prostitutes on weekends and has gone nuts bc he realizes you figured it out (actually you did ages before) Yeah they can’t tell you if he is staying by you either lol, but rest assured he probably checks in with an app. Hell I would rather be home than on vacation staying in a hotel packed like sardines.
I resonate. I have good information and analysis that I won't last more than 3-6 more. MAYBE 9-12, but that's super unlikely.  🐲✨🐲✨🐲✨
I’m over 60 and love rock, been following these guys for awhile and I can only agree with all the tributes voiced so far, such a nice guy and a great talent, will be ever in our thoughts, 🇦🇺
Still cant believe this :(
a great drummer a great singer a great loss
When I heard initially there was "no cause" that usually means drugs which unfortunately turned out to be the case. Several substances in his hotel room and in his system which usually doesn't end well and resulted in a bad outcome. Very sad. RIP.
Who else wants to get the Fauci ouchie??
DIDNT PASS AWAY..He KILLED himself on drugs and careless living.  Stop COVERING the HOW.   It wasnt some mystery death..OVER 10 drugs in his system.  THat is dysfunctional with a capitol D
God noooooo.     I'm lost
RIP.
Rip to one of the men that made one of the best Jojos characters
RIP.  Foo Fighters we’re on my bucket list before I die.  I’m saddened that a missing piece of the band is in heaven.
Are we ever gonna figure out why he died or we just gonna hold this L?
Terrible news, Ill bet he was vaccinated...
another life lost to COVID
Did he try to beat Steve-O or what? How do you need 10 diffrent drugs.... I don't get it.
In life we all lose people close to us. . . But this feels so close to home! I hope his family feel the love from the community. . . Never did anyone expect this . . .  that is life. I can’t imagine the foo’s without Taylor. . . . But I can’t imagine the world without the foo’s!
Incredibly sad loss.   I wonder if he had to take vaccine or booster and if that had anything to do with,  as we know alot people celebrity's too have had adverse reactions.
They wanted all their audience to get the kill shot. Appears Instant Kharma(tm) just add water applies here.  Remember when in Guyana do not drink the Kool Aid.
Going to see more of these with all of the Vaccinations. before you hate, do your research.
OMG!! What??
I wasn’t a big fan of the foo fighters, but I was a fan of Taylor Hawkins, amazing drumming talent and a brilliant guy…..rip Taylor
Clot Shot??
Dave Grohl strikes again. Kurt Cobain is a legend. Foo fighters had like two good songs.
R.I.P. Taylor 🥁🙏♥️
Jeez. Hope it wasn't drugs 😬😕
Colombia*, never Columbia, that's in NY, for reference. Right now what matters most is our legend, beloved Taylor gone 😢😢😢😢 RIP brother.
So glad I got to witness his greatness several times.
This is so sad. Another talent taken due to the demon of drug abuse. It's such a horrible addiction.
Conspiracy Theory: 💉💉
preliminary toxicology tests indicated Hawkins had 10 psychoactive substances and medicines in his system, including marijuana, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines, the AP reported.  A cause of death has not yet been determined, and Colombia’s Prosecutor’s Office did not classify Hawkins’ death as an overdose in its statement, Variety reported." od, no way?, NOT.
What?!? Holy shit!  Prayers for his fam
DRUGS DRUGS DRUGS DRUGS DRUGS............WE'VE LEARNED NOTHING FROM HENDRIX.
So sad…Rest east Taylor and GOD be with his family at this time
Love and prayers go out to the family of the Hawkins much love and thank u for all that u have done here and much prayers to ur family
Bummed. :(
So sad. I love these guys
R I P Sincere Condolences to Family and Friends ✌️💞🎶🙏🙏
Dude wtf this fcking sucks and is beyond sad RIP TAYLOR HAWKINS
Columbia ain't like here, you don't wait 6 months to release loser's cause of death. Bogata boo yah.
Dope and the vacine dont mix
You spelled Colombia wrong rock fed, what are you racit?
Shouldn't have got that fourth booster. Fool.
Life time of drugs had nothing to do with it.. sure huh right!!😏😏
Drugs are bad Mmmkay.
Taylor got the experimental Covid shot, don’t forget to get your 4th booster 😂
Can’t stop wondering if the vaccine had something to do with it.
Guy was a drug addicted talent, unfortunately he can be seen as a role model
Just pain! I cannot believe he is gone. Just so sad! I pray for his family and friends.💜 Just in shock!
My condolences to Taylor's loved ones and fans. May he rest in peace.
Dave Grohl's ritual sacrifice. Wake up
Sanguine addiction those silver syringe a last drugs benediction
*He ded from an overdose in Colombia🤣*
Uma grande perda no cenário musical, meus sentimentos aos familiares e amigos próximos
I didn't even know he was sick.
Was so shocked to hear this!!! So unexpected and I can't believe this has happened, such a shame for him and his family, also the Foo Fighters won't be the same without him, its just so sad on so many levels, he seemed such a nice guy and 50 is so young as he seemed so fit! Bless him and his family and band members 🙏🌹
Rest In Peace Taylor Hawkins, God bless you 🙏🕊❤
R.I.P
Damn. Very sad. Too young. Tragic. Condolences to his family.
Sorry for your loss
Latest news says he had opiates…anti depressants & multiple other things in his system. Unfortunately it was probably that deadly combination of benzodiazepines & opiates. It has killed so many.
🤔Vaccinated??, what a shame.
Bonham.... Hawkins....
oh that vaccine!!! don't do it💉
He is in the next chapter and is in the greatest place. It is the living that have to suffer. Life is short. Say the things you want your loved ones to know.
I was always so impressed with his drumming talent and his bright happy face.
Keep glorifying these guys who did so much coke that their hearts were destroyed.
Whaaaat?
This news came out of left field, very unexpectedly! The world is going to miss him!!  RIP Taylor Hawkins!  😇🙏🏼
Been a fan of his since 2000. Great drummer and a better person
THAT REALLLLY SUCKS! my condolences to his family and real friends.
Crazy, Sad.
COLOMBIA NOT COLUMBIA
Its a sad shame. A talent that had much left in the tank. Judging from what was in his system,  I'd say there was something more going on mentally with Taylor then we thought.
Parece que en el cielo están armando una superbanda y necesitan bateristas..... QEPD !!!!
Condolences to the bereaved family and all the members of Foo Fighters. Rest in peace, Mr. Taylor Hawkins. Thank you for the music.
That Columbian coke is way to strong!R.I.P
That covid vaccine is a hell of a drug!
So sad.  Feel terrible for the families and band mates. And so sad for Dave. I remember when Kurt died so tragically and it was devastating.  Taylor was such a talented fellow.  I'm so sorry to hear this news.
Such a loss...  😖
RIP, Brother.  My condolences to your family, friends, and co-workers.
Grew up listening to these guys and will always continue to this is so sad
No words
I play Drums My whole life But nothing like T. Hawkins
Tired of losing our musicians in hotel rooms by themselves rest in peace Taylor Hawkins condolences to the family and bandmates and anyone that knew him🤯😒😭genuine smile and genuine laughter may God keep the wind in your sails and the sun on your face
I’ve never gone to a major live music event before. I had just bought tickets for their show in August thinking I’d get lucky enough to see him and the whole foo fighters band play. It’s sad to say I was too late. Rest in peace.
Dang what a bummer. They were doing so much new stuff too, like the Studio 666 movie and the Dream Widow stuff, what an un-timely death...
Quit saying RIP. unless he was born again he will have no rest. The wages of sin is death!! Stop with the idolatry.
Really the best drummer in the world?? The Foo Fighters? I know it's sad but to say the best is pretty far fetched. Better to say the best to you not ever.
Oh man… this one really hurts… RIP you legend… may you find peace and your spirit evolve 💛✨
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Ugh,…too young RIP
Great band foo fighters 👏 RIP Taylor Hawkins
Kurt now Taylor. Dave must have PTSD.
What.
Buger.hes great drumer
This was very terrible, shockin`bad news. They were about to perform later here at Bogota`s Stereo Pic Nic music festival. A truly and devastating lost, specialy to all drums world wide community. He was my favourite drummer from mid 90's until today, with his poerwfull  and consistent drumming`, the driving force for a Foo`s sound. God bless his family, relatives and friends. Rest in Peace, Taylor. We'll never forget you. Thanks for keeping rock music alive today.
The dealer who sold that basuca (colombiandrug for homeless) for a thousand (it's worth less than a dolar to natives) to him must be out of Colombia rn. El dealer que le vendió esa basuca (droga colombiana de indigentes) a ese parcero por mil dólares (vale menos de un dólar para los lugareños de la calle) debe estar fuera de Colombia ya.

Sad loss incredibly stunning. RIP Mr Hawkins
RIP Taylor
Man, I really can't believe this 😪.
Sad the guy wasted his life on drugs. The Foos are are discriminatory, Pharma-shilling assholes...hope the rest of them go bankrupt
bbboooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
Just wow... 😔
How many legends have we lost in a hotel room? This is so tragic man. RIP
Fighting Foo ain't easy.
Experimental gene editing drugs, is a hell of a drug!
He's now going to be talked about as if he's the greatest drummer ever.
No HE didn’t. he’s just embarrassed of the movie for some reason, Probably surrounded with hater SPIRITS talking shit on the Comedy. (Wakes the next morning) “WHY DID I THINK THAT WAS FUNNY!?” I haven’t seen the movie yet…

Folks, google "died suddenly" and hit the news button and start scrolling through the stories.  Notice how many relatively young and healthy folks are dying of the same thing?  Notice that they are typically not indicating whether or not they have that certain "status" that we are all supposed to have?  Notice how many worked at facilities, schools, or jurisdictions that quite recently instated mandates?
See you in hell Johnny!

don't do drugs, kids
F**k!  This really made my day go to s**t!  Rest in peace Taylor you beautiful soul, you were insanely talented!  😭
Just think about it. Dave Grohl and Taylor have been in the Foos longer than Dave and Kurt were in Nirvana together. This has to be as big..or bigger of a loss to Dave than losing Kurt Cobain…  I truly feel for Dave right now, and I’m sure the rest of the band are feeling it just as bad.
Rest in peace
rip Taylor
Anybody know if he was fully vaxxed or not. Really would like to know.
Never use alone and keep narcan/test strips on hand.  Was the drug locally supplied? I'm trying to understand how a seasoned user overdoses.
RIP Taylor...I can't help but think of Pat Smear and what he must be thinking. He was in The LEGENDARY Germs when Crash committed suicide, touring in Nirvana when Kurt committed suicide and now, in the Foo Fighters when Taylor dies. Awful. Awful. Awful. Rock n roll  can be a very dangerous  "business" to be in. If you asked Dave how many fellow musicians he knew that have died, it would take him an hour to name them all. So many of the "Gen X bands" have had tragedy after tragedy, including the entire grunge/Seattle movement. Taylor was the exact same age as me and if you're thinking fifty is "old"...well, just wait and see how quickly it comes and see if you still feel the same way.
My deepest condolences going out to his wife and kids, his band mates, and all of his fans around the world. To quote Chris Cornell, "Say hello to heaven." RIP Taylor. 🙏
Nickelback sucks... can the rest of death be on that band, plz
He was another rock star, that lived up to the name, and then some, in the sense that he understood that the only reason he could put bread on the table for his family, is because of the fans. Just like Dave. Just like Neil Peart, the guys from Korn... and so many others
We love the foo fighters here in Amsterdam . Life has a way to crush the human spirit , this is one of them .
Incredibly sad news. Condolences to his family, Foo Fighter’s  and fans everywhere. He was such a cool guy with a huge smile on his face !
Such a damned shame.  RIP
Where was Taylor Hawkins from?
It's so unfair....my condolences to his family and band mates... Rest In Peace, Taylor....
Sending love R.I.P.
right now he is Making his way back home when he learn to fly
RIP Taylor
Cherish every moment of life every second God Bless Family Friends and Bandmates RIP Taylor Hawkins...
Man, this is right up there with Chris Cornell, what a tragedy.
“Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,” ‭‭Acts‬ ‭3:19‬ ‭NKJV‬‬.
Woah, chest pains from a guy whose band required the vaccine at their concerts, might there be a connection?
RIP Kurt Cobain, RIP Taylor Hawkins. Rock Legends
MAY HE REST IN ETERNAL PEACE. MY CONDOLENCES TO HIS FAMILY.
🤘😝 Taylor Hawkins!  R.I.P.  Gone but never forgotten!!! 💔
Gematria Effect News shows how it was another ritual by the numbers.
What the fuck , what a shock unbelievable this is truly nuts rip a legend what a drummer
Damn.... just watched Route 666... RIP
Watch the illusion YouTube channel ... he explains this well... it’s not what you think
Was he Jabbed?
I’m devestated by this. Condolences to his family and the Foo family. R I P Taylor 💔😭💔
“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NKJV‬‬.
That horrible grunge guy who just died in screaming trees was a junkie too.
He just got the gig, replacing Stumpy Joe in Spinal Tap.
This is the kind of news I dread hearing, especially when it's about a fellow musician. I never met him, but he seemed like a really awesome human being. R.I.P. Taylor Hawkins
So sad 😖
As a fellow drummer this hurts man too many leaving us Joey J Neil P Vinny P now Taylor H RIP 🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁
wow
WTF say it ain't so.
No fuckin way
oh no....he was a bright light
I found out on Fux news, death sells.
Oh my goodness, this is so sad
my god i just opened the pc and one of my firt notification was this. Rest in peace TAYLOR HAWKINS 🖤...
can pass away when you are addicted to heroine. you die. plain and simple. next
Gee, I wonder if he had his Fauci death shots up to date so he could travel?  Seems like a lot of young people just happen to be dropping dead for no reason lately.
R.I.P. Taylor, way too young...
Grohl wouldn't give him any Nirvana T-shirt money.
Wow. That is a shocker. Damn.
Cannot even digest this, what a tragic loss at such a young age. Sending my deepest sympathies and condolences to the Hawkins Family, my heart breaks for his Wife and three children, to the Foos I can't imagine the grief held between Dave and the band, just feel gutted for them, and to the people who knew Taylor, my thoughts and prayers are with you all. R.I.P. Taylor Hawkins. 😥🥁🪦Gone far too soon.
Any word on a cause yet? This is heartbreaking news
Sucks so F!ING! BAD!!!! RIP MAN!
No words would be enough. Sad that the good ones are taken from us, so young. It’s goes beyond what Taylor brought to the Foos and rock music. That is a given. But more importantly what kind of man he was. The father, family man, husband and friend. Rest in eternal peace Taylor.
RIP
🕯🥁✊🏽
Rock on and rest easy Taylor🕯️🤘❤️
Was actually a double. Real Hawkins got shot at SXSW.
Heartbroken.  Rest easy Taylor.
So so sad. RIP One if the best drummers ever 🖤
never listened to food fighters, never will.
💔💔💔
I woke up absolutely devastated by this news. I first saw Foo Fighters 10 years ago at Reading Festival 2012. Taylor's banter with Dave Grohl was one of the best things about the show, along with his superhuman drumming, and I've seen them twice since. There's comfort to be taken in the fact that so many across the music industry are paying tribute, paying respect, and showing love. As a guitarist in a rock band I can't imagine a musical landscape without them. Even if a rock band that emerged post-2000 wasn't directly inspired by Foo Fighters, then one of their influences, or one of their influences' influences, almost certainly was. Every modern rock band owes something to Foo Fighters, and every modern rock drummer owes something to Taylor Hawkins. Rest in power.
He was vaxed just like all the other celebrities  that have passed recently!!, but people want to act like that  fake  information !! When Pfizer says  it can  cause death  documents  released a few weeks ago !!!' People are stupid !!
Tragedy Just a Tragedy, Another Amazing Musician, Cut Early, Peace Out Brother Rest In Peace🥁🥁🥁🤍🎤💕🏆🏆🏆
💉💉💉⚰.    Is that hard to figure out?.
RIP in peace legend.
He died in Columbia? I can only imagine what it was from. God I hope it wasn't that. Cocaine.
Ah man this is sad. Condolences to the Taylor family 🙏🇨🇦
Just out of the blue what could be the cause … ??? Poor Taylor such a lovely man
I’m sure it was drugs
That's what happens to pill pushers
I'm so sad to hear this news.  RIP Taylor. 😢😢
Incredibly sad news. Much love to his family and friends ♥️🖤
Rip Legend...this one really hurts as bad as Cornell 😪
Solid drummer, unfortunately had a habit and almost overdosed 20 years ago.  Sad he may not have been able to keep his demons at bay.  Not saying he died from drugs, but they were in South America…..
Sad. I wonder if he was fully v@-xxed or not?? The media has been covering up the side effects from the jab for two year's now!! Not a conspiracy theory either. Do the research and turn off the msm 📺 propaganda!! They get millions from b¡g ph@rm@. Think about it.
Very sad , amazing drummer R.I.P  Taylor .
So it's Colombia? Always thought it was named after Columbus.
Taylor Hawkins died yesterday so sad😢😢😢😢 rest in peace man Christmas present is here today Christmas past is past Christmas future is far away now he doesn't have to worry about covid mask or social distanceing make sure to say hi to my grandpa for me and give him a big hug and a high five for me okay and ed asner too 😢
He lived that gangsta life. Gnome sayin'?
This sucks
What did he die from?
Holy shit.  He was like #2 in the Foo Fighters.  First Kurt now Taylor.  Dave Grohl has had almost death in his life as me?!  Taylor was a diffrent critter than Kurt....Kurt was a tortured soul....Taylor was a shining light.  Both amazing people in their own right.  Rest in peace bro.  Stay strong Dave and family.
Vaxxed n boosted why he died.
Unfoking believeable :,( brooo 50 years old... :'(
It was a nice day today . The British winter long and miserable ended . And there was beautiful sunshine.  I was happy. And then someone told me Taylor had left us. My mood changed . My deepest sympathy  to his family and friends . A lovely person. Rest in peace Drummer boy.
Hope it wasn't because of the clot shot. Rip Taylor
I was ready to have a good weekend when I found out about this. Such a let down
Imagine someone died and the first thing you think of is “shit I gotta make a video so I can monetize off his death”
Absolutely gutted ,when my dad passed away 4 years ago listening to taylor and the boys loudly (screaming and shouting)along with dave. Was my way of coping with grief. Devastated the end of an era, rest in peace T.
This is so sad. What a great musician.  Sucks man.
Seriously can’t believe this
RIP Taylor, sorry Dave but I think we lost possibly the greatest drummer of all time, we will miss you Taylor
Oh what damn 😱😥they were coming to New Zealand in May  Another legend drummer gone damn
😢😢😢
Wow. This hurts. I hope his family will be okay. I bet Dave is crushed. I hope Dave won’t stop making music for a second time in his life.
I thought when I heard the news after my 530 AM pee that I was having a horrible nightmare.  When I finally got up the noon news repeated the worst news I have heard in a while.  I am gutted and feel nothing but condolences for his family, band, crew and fans.  That is almost everyone.  So young and talented.  I am gutted.  Have loved them forever.  Godspeed, Taylor.
Deeply saddened
Yo soy de Bogotá Colombia y fue una sorpresa la muerte de este baterista
Courtney Love did it.
Dave Grohl is an American rock musician, singer, songwriter, and director who has a net worth of $320 million dollars
ok I'm off to console food fighter fans as they mourne  their terrible "music", guy was only worth $55M. peanuts to cheapee grohl. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
Wasn’t he like triple vaccinated? Good job lol
Putin?
That's a picture of Dave Grohl.
And the Pat Smear death curse, continues.
Anybody seen Pat Smear?
Either drugs, alcohol or the vaccine!
First athletes and soccer players droppin’ down and now actors and musicians, hm, suspiciuos🙁
who?
Keep getting those vaccines.  It's good to be the vax nazi.
It is impossible, some things are wrong with this established system of this society, have not died at 50, this must hide truths. I don't believe in fake news hiding the real cause of this death...
50 year olds just don't "pass away".  People want to know what happened.
Woke up to this today, what a huge loss!!!! I met him in 2015 at a Chevy Metal show in upstate New York, class act!! R.I.P
ColuMbia police say drugs could have been cause
He was vaxxed and due to the high altitude of Bogota Columbia, blood clots took him. I feel for the vaxed
The most charismatic drummer in the last 20 years. RIP Taylor Hawkins
WOW!!!! SO SAD!!!!
What the fuck is going on!! This is awful!! First it was mark Lanegan now this
Rest in peace dude. It always makes me sad when musicians of our time is passing away. Heartbroken but life happens yall.
RIP TAYLOR HAWKINS gone to soon, never will he be forgotten. PEACE BE WITH YOU MY FRIEND'S.
Please tell me this is not true
OMG  such sadness 😢 Taylor you will live forever in our hearts
Guy was only 50. What happened?
Rest in peace Taylor.
Overdose fetanyl
its COLOMBIA!
💉
Wonder if it was because of Pfizer or Moderna.. not even joking. Sad day.... he was a light in a dark world. RIP Taylor.
Im shocked right now! Cant take anymore deaths this year
RIP Taylor 😞🌹
Taylor seemed like one of the nicest souls. A total bummer. Safe travels, brother. R.I.P.
Holy crap! So sad. May God give his family strength.
Why these rocks stars don't understand that if you do drugs all day your not going to live long.  Very selfish on his part having kids ,, shame on him
He was so young this is so heartbreaking 😢
Rest In Peace, Taylor! Thanks for the amazing FF drumming, Birds of Satan, Alanis, Zeppelin covers, Chevy Metal, Sound City, Studio 666 - the list goes on and on! You were an amazing individual and musician. The world just lost one of the Greats! You’ll never be forgotten, and definitely; Thanks for the line…… 🤘🤘🤘
OMG died how he was so young
I can't Believe We Lost Taylor
Vax. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.
How many more do we have to lose?
Prayers 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
The only man who could make you not wish Dave Grohl wasn’t on the drums.
vaccine killed another
I want this to just be some sort of sick joke. Out of all the things that could go wrong I would have never expected this. This is a monumental loss for the world.
How he died doesn't matter at this point.  He was a father, husband, bandmate, friend, and above all, a good human being.  Nothing but love, Taylor.  Rest easy.
It was drug related. He had a kid and still risked his life which makes him a piece of shit. No music or personality can be more important than the core morals of protecting your child from harm.
Damn dude wtf is going on?....❤
Was it the vaccine he was forced to take?
RIP 🙏
This one hurts, alot.
He appeared to have had a heart attack.  RIP.
Massive love, respect and sadness 🤘🏻😔💔🥁
So tragic..  I was thinking about Foo Fighters all day yesterday for some reason (long before it was announced that he passed).  My father (who was also an amazing musician/guitarist) passed at age 55 over 15 years ago.  So sad when good people die so young.  RIP Taylor
What's crazy is Taylor  (from my understanding at least) is the guy who kept dave with his over all sanity...im a little worries what will happen to dave now....man this is way too sudden and unexpected
First thing I heard this morning and the rest of the day is gone to crap.
i can't believe it, i just started getting back into their music yesterday :( Taylor seemed like such a cool, funny, genuine human being. what a tragic loss.
Did the covid kill shot claim another?
The country is *Colombia* not "Columbia."
He was poisoned. That fentynal crap. The Cartels need to be Napalmed to Hell
So sorry to Taylor what a loss to Dave grohl. The man lost Kurt and now Taylor. Let’s see how this ends. It’ll go like nirvana or like kiss/AC/DC/slip knot
Awful news. Bless his heart.
Heroin?
It's Colombia, not Columbia. Thanks
No freaking way !!!! This is so sad 😞  Brilliant drummer !!! Prayers to his family.  RIP ❤️
Cocaine is a hell of a drug.
He's probably hangin with Lemmy
Devastating news to wake up too. The best drummer I've ever seen. Hope this isn't the end of the Foo Fighters.
2 or 3 Jabs?
DRUGS. DRUGS. DRUGS. DRUGS. DRUGS. DRUGS. DRUGS. DRUGS. DRUGS.
This is really sad. God bless his family and crew . Rest In Peace Boss
Good luck on your new journey Taylor.xx
Goodbye my brother Rest In Peace😔🤘😪🙏👊💛😎
💜💖❤ RIP & Thank you Taylor -x-
so sad      R.I.P. Taylor
Well boys and girls this is what happens when you do drugs your hole life!!!  Sorry not sorry!!!
Omg!…..I’m so sorry for this tragic loss….and my condolences to his family and his foo family 😞
So sad. Taylor I’ll keep you and your family in my prayers prayers.  Rest Easy Brother
Rest in power my friend 🤟 Totally shocked by this news!!! Prayers and love to your family and friends!!!
rip💔🙏😔
I swear anytime you go making a movie about the beast -666 it will come and bite you in the ass
I feel so bad for Dave right now. He lost Kurt, and now lost Taylor.  RIP Taylor Hawkins. You may be gone, but you will not be forgotten.😞
Probably jibby jabby related
Young healthy and triple vaxed...don't hate, just saying. RIP
For all of the press Keith Richards got about his drug use, there was a huge difference. One he didn’t mainline and most importantly his drugs were medical grade quality? Actual medical grade drugs are more predictable and wether this case is drugs or not, how many folk are dying from everything being laced with fentanyl🤔
This is crazy man, r.i.p
😢
Thanks Taylor for all that you did!
Poor Dave.......another really close friend that died.
I feel gutted Horrible for Dave Grohl, when you're that close to someone that they become your shadow, your brother from another mother best friend, this kind of thing can bring that person to the lowest depths of heartbreak sadness and sorrow, my heart goes out to all who were very close.
So incredibly sad... One of the good ones
Damn......
Heart attack?  Blood clots?  Was he on smack?  Still sucks though..he was a good drummer.
vaxxed with booster ...
Devastated
Spring equinox sacrifice. Expect more celebrities to drop around this time soon.
Who?
What’s the cause of death? My understanding is he was not a drug abuser. By any chance was he jabbed? RIP.
🙏🏼
@Man be careful, cocaine in Colombia is 100% pure, not like this garbage that you find on the streets of NYC that has 1000 of unidentified substances and just 1% of cocaine!
Remember when the band demanded their fans all be vaccinated at their shows? SCHADENFREUDE!
Nooooo!!   WTF?  My condolences!!
Sad, but if you play with 🔥 fire, you will get burnt.
🙏🏼RIP🙏🏼 🥺😣😢 xx
He's so young, this is Heartbreaking 💔 .  My condolences and deepest sympathies to him his family and friends his band mates 🙏.
I'm so glad to know Taylor had a vaccine booster recently. I can't imagine how much worse it could have been had he been unvaccinated.
The Foo Fighters required vaccine proof in order to attend their show (s)  wonder how many went out like this because of them, between him and god now tho RIP
No😭😭😭😭😭
The Foo Fighters required vaccine proof in order to attend their show. Never cared for them, wasn't for Kurt and Nirvana they'd never made anything, their Music suxed compared to Kurt esp  the Mtv unplug, IMHO ..each to their own pepsi or coke   wonder how many took the chy-na jab and died because of them and his 666 on his drum kit, to pay to hear their crap but, what ever...RIP it is between him and God now
Just devastated 😢
He passed away in his sleep. And the Angel's took him to heaven. R.I.P you will be missed😔😔😩😩😩😔
Why he passed away?
Why are so many young healthy people dying. He better not have a swollen heart. Sus
It's not often that news of a famous person passing away hits me hard like it would if it were family or friends, but this does. Foo Fighters gets played every day in my house. RIP Taylor.
I can't believe he's gone... I am a huge fan of the Foo Fighters, and finding this out just now killed me inside.
Gods speed
A sad day for many of us . Rest in Sweet Peace Taylor
Wow wtf fuck no way 😭😭😭😭just lost a superstar
I just found out another JUNKIE HAHAHA
Ok drugs or suicide?????
I'm so devastated by this news.  I really hate this. My heart goes out to his wife and family.  It also goes out to Dave and the band.  Man he was so funny in interviews and such a great rock drummer.  This is so sad.  We'll miss you Mr. Hawkins.  RIP
This fuckin sucks !!! This guy was so  cool... Loved alot of Foo songs. Why am i suspecting the vax might be at play here ?
Repose en paix Taylor 😢😔🙏🕊 Belgique 🇧🇪
😭 RIP Taylor
💉💉💉💉💉💉☠️
FU*K!!! My condolences to his family and band mates..I was supposed to see the foo fighters again this summer..
I was watching a foo fighters documentary when I heard the news. I had to read it twice just to take it in. Dave Grohl will be devestated as will a lot of people xx
RIP Taylor. Gone far too soon. This news has gutted the music world.
It was the INJECTION .... PLEASE people “wake up”  We are being played!!!
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
Wow this is unreal, I know these always come out of nowhere but there's something about this time that just feels so particularly sudden  Definitely one of the best drummers of the 2000's, no contest  His spirit will live on through Dave and the rest of the Foo's
Niel Perth, Joey Jordison and now Taylor  Truly Shocked!!! R.I.P!
So sad , can't imagine the pain his family is going through and the band also seemed so close really feel for dave and Co
THIS WORLD IS SO FUCKIN' CRUEL, TO TAKE KURT AND NOW TAYLOR "THUNDERARMS" HAWKINS. HE WILL ABSOLUTELY BE MISSED. SO SORRY FOR DAVE AND THE LADS. RIP AGAIN!
Drug overdose?
This is so messed up, very sad to hear this
How sad. A beautiful soul with a beautiful smile xx RIP xx love to his family xx too sad xx
People die every day. He’s famous and rich so we hear about it …. Wonder what his vax status was and health history
😢
Chester Bennington has the best drummer to add to his band in Heaven now. RIP Taylor 🙏 🕊
TAYLOR HAWKINS YOU WILL BE SADLY MISSED BY EVERYONE.   BUT YOUR MUSIC WILL LIVE ON FOREVER R.I.P. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE GREAT MEMORIES YOU HAVE LEFT US. FROM SCULLY LFC.
This hurt so unexpectedly! One of my favorite drummers period. It hurts I never got to see him play live. RIP Taylor.
So sad
RIP🙏✌️
I just keep wishing that this was a hoax.  A bad April fools joke.  Anything of that nature.  This sucks
Damn, RIP Thawk!
Dave Grohl needed a blood sacrifice
Horrible loss !!! R. I. P. My friend until we meet again
R.I.P.
jhonathan davis [korn] was on tictoc talking about it
NOOOOOOO😭😭😭😢😢😢🥺🥺🥺
shocking, it really is - RIP all the best to his family and the FF of course too
He just seemed like a creep
Never liked the guy.
My thoughts and prayers are to his family and friends and I will respect his family as a die hard fan should and I will continue listening to foo fighters in his honor and I hope the radio will play some of the songs by foo fighters today and rest of the year and next year and beyond
Absolutely surreal.... i just can't believe it.
Taylor!!!!!  So sad!!!  But music, still goes on!!!
I can't believe it..first question I have is was he jabbed? It's very sad news.
noooo! fuck this year sucks! why are so many celebs dying?
Probably double jabbed and triple boosted too. What a shame.
There's a time to live and a time to die.
Get the clot shot everyone.  Your life depends on it...
_¡ remember watching Learn to Fly on MTV and seeing this guy as a woman and made me feel some type of way_
good grief im devastated... so untimely... this suck soo bad....
Semana is the worst mass media in Colombia, of the shiting Colombian government.
I got to meet Taylor briefly in LA in 2014. He was about to do a show with one of his side projects somewhere in the Northern part of the city. My best friend and I walked around back of the venue and asked him for a picture. It was an awkward moment considering we were total strangers but he was kind enough to let us take a couple photos and gave us a fist pump after. I've also been fortunate to see the Food fighters 3 times live and had a great time
Guy was a total legend. Learning to play drums at the grand old age of 58. Love the Foo's. Gobsmacked. Such a talent. RIP Taylor. Big hugs to the band. Sad day. 😔
He was also a hilarious actor in all the videos he was in with Dave.
Oh no….this is awful news. He was such an awesome guy, so positive and humble and an amazing drummer full of amazing energy. One of the best rock drummers in the world. Chops for days and I remembering hearing interviews of him talking about how he learned to play drums as a kid and excelled quickly and was playing at a very high skill level within a few years and started playing with Alanis not much long after his beginnings. An amazing, truly naturally talented drummer. RIP. Horrible loss.
So sorry to hear about Taylor passing away ! My love and sympathy to Dave and rest of his band mates ! Love this band !! Condolences to his wife and family  !
Clot shots killed him
Thoughts to his to young family and bandmates. Unbelievable,,, RIP
WHAT???
This is why you Must go see your heros/musicians LIVE! You never know when theyll leave us. Very privileged to be able to see them live!
Such a sad day 😢 R.I.P Taylor
95% sure The Vax ended him.    ….aren’t the Foo Fighters requiring Vaccine Passports to attend their shows? 😂🤣
My prayers 2 all who were touched by and loved Taylor ! Just dang!
This is painful; the Foo Fighters were just hitting a new creative period. Taylor Hawkins, an incredible all around talent, as one of the best drummers of all time. It will be awhile before I can listen to Times Like These the same way. R.I.P Taylor Hawkins
Pfizer?
Aw man, I never really liked much FF stuff, but for some reason I still think they're one of the greatest bands of all time and I always loved that guy. He always had a lot of enthusiasm.
Do drugs got yourself to blame. He was not poor or alone so that's no excuse
Irreplaceable loss
finally he can jam with legend again...foo fighters are so lame...nirvana best
So what were the circumstances of his death??
I am gutted, listened to nothing but foos today at work. me n the girl a work with talked about nothing else at work, was looking forward to seeing the foos again this year 💔 I feel so badly for his family and freinds :( rest in peace my man you seemed like such a chill dude you will be missed by everyone. We love you..💔 😔 😇
What a bunch of liars.... just say he died from shooting up herion
fentanyl is a certain death sentence
What I've loved about Taylor aside from his obvious great drumming, was his singing ability, his performing out front, his great friendships with so many especially Dave grohl. His love of family and he was so creative. So many reasons to love the guy. My heart aches today.
Dude embraced being in Dave's shadow and always had a smile on his face. There's plenty of other drummers that can perform the music but it just won't have the same spirit/energy to it.
More tragic news brought to you by Pfizer.
No words…. 💔😭
Terrible news.....The Foo Fighters will never be the same, no matter who takes over the drum kit - if they do decide to continue - he is pretty much irreplaceable
he od'd on heroin
He was vacinated?
Why.Does it have something to do with Dave grohl joining the Hollywood cult.There is some weird shit going on inside those circles.
This is devastating. He was way too young. I wonder if he was vaccinated. I've seen a lot of hear, blood clot, and stroke issues because of the jab. I hope he isn't just the next in a long line casualties caused by an experimental jab.
Damn!
Such terrible news. From every account all the guys in the Foo's are gorgeous inside and out, no egos, no attitude, just genuinely lovely guys. And what an incredible talent, too. I feel terrible for his family, friends and colleagues. We've really lost a great one here. Rest in Peace Taylor Hawkins.
Say no to drugs kids
Absolutely heartbreaking!! Unfortunately this is where drugs will lead us.
Dave and Courtney got another one
So sad. Great guy. Awesome musician. Much luv bro.
What the fuck?...  at 50?    He will be surely missed...
*DUDE WAS ONLY 50!!!*   *F I F T Y !!!*
This is sad. Incredible band, & he was a great drummer & singer. This most certainly has to be drug induced. Poor guy, just goes to show that not matter what your level of success is life can be too much sometimes. Godspeed… 🙏
OMG!! WHAT!? HAWKINS DIED!? I wasn't expecting to be shedding so many tears this morning, but I can't stop. I Love Ya Sir - Thank You for sharing so much happiness with the world - I was hoping to see You still playing for at least 30 more yrs. Bless You & Your Loved ones - My Best to You all - This is an unbelievably Huge Loss. Much Love to You & Your family. If I feel this sad - I can't BEGIN to imagine how those who Truly knew must feel. R.I.P. Good Sir - You will NEVER B forgotten!!
Dam dam dam!!! What a gut punch, RIP rock star!!😢
Amazing drummer & a beautiful man inside & out. I'm devastated. Much love to the family. 🌻
Wonder if he took the vax
Rip Taylor your were legend.
Guess he couldn't handle that good shit down in Colombia
Sorry to say… it was the Vaccine
😪
Such a fun-loving positive guy. I was shocked at the news. Hopefully it wasn't substance-caused. He had alot left to give the music world.
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Such a shame. He was a genuinely cool guy. Full of life and energy.
This really sucks and is a huge blow to the music community. Taylor was a great dude. Him and Dave were like brother's. And in the middle of a tour. A bad vaccine reaction?
jabbed
My heart goes out to the Foos, Taylor's family, and all the families that have had someone pass with a 'Sudden Illness'.   The kindest guy in rock. Gonna miss you. Any updates on how this might have happened? I, like everyone, am heart broken. Love goes out to all of you 💔
Yet another sad and untimely loss of a very "Talented and Genuine individual" May he find eternal peace and true happiness. Heartfelt sorrow and best wishes to the loved ones he has left behind, both family and those who knew him as a friend. RIP Taylor to me, forever a fighter.
Rest in Peace.
😫😫😫😫🤯
I can't even imagine how Dave feels, losing a close bandmate for the second time. Horrible.
I saw them live. Rip taylor bro. I teared up a little today
Well I guess Dave is playing drums again.
Bloody terrible 😭
Such BS.  What a beautiful soul.. 😞
Drugs will always catch up to you. Sad. Now he faces eternity after mocking God
Damn, another great one gone to soon. 😪
Wtf
Omg 😭 shit man.....im so unhappy 😭 shit im very sad
WTF!!! 😖
Please God no more bad news !
This is a fking shock wtf he was such a great drummer and great guy.
Hopefully wasn't the clot shot.
I usually don't get emotional over someone I don't know, but I can't stop Myself from crying! What a Tragic Loss!! RIP Taylor! Our thoughts are with Your Family, Friends and Band Members.
I still remember watching the Learn to Fly video years ago, preparing to play it with my friends in the band we had. He was such a pillar of the Foo Fighters, such a wonderful smile and infectious laughter, so many memories linked to his drum playing. A true loss to the rock world. Rest in peace in Taylor. My heartfelt condolences to his family, and that includes the Foo Fighters. You will always live on in the sound of your drums.
I'm sure it is from the vaccine. FF were pushing it hard.
Shocking!!! Why!!! Sooo Young!!! Breaks my heart😭
rip  Taylor
Man, I wake up to find out this... this just hurts my soul.
Was he double vaxed?
Terrible news!!!!! Seemed like a really great guy. My condolences to his family and friends, also the millions of heartbroken fans.
Almost as if its karma for being so closely associated to an evil filthy satan spawn who had the real talent killed so he could go off and start his own band. Go woke go... Dead? Oh well, consequences gonna consequence
😢Noo!! To wake up to this news is just awful! My prayers go out to his family, his band mates, and the whole world of music. We just lost a beautiful light in an ugly world. RIP TAYLOR HAWKINS!
RIP Taylor,  I loved the music you made. I was a fan back with Alanis too
WHAT HOW?
Very sad news RIP
R I p Taylor
I feel like I lost a close freind even though I've never had the pleasure of meeting him.
So sad.
What is going on? I'm in shock and saddened hearing this news.  All of these  rock performers passing away.
So sad. I heard about it first. When LJ of seven dust was telling everyone about it last night. During the show here in KC. So sad to hear.
Prays to Taylos family, friends, and band mates. The world lost one of the best. RIP man
Not a huge Foo Fighters fan but he seemed like a great drummer and nice guy.
Dude what the duck
Uh oh - is Courtney Love bombing again? Sorry, I couldn't help myself. Don't like to Foo Fighters at all but this is sad.
Heartbroken :(
Legend.
A true talent that can't be replaced.  I'm so sorry for your loss.
in dismay.....
I woke up a little while ago and I was wishing it was fake news, but none. Another shitty day, I'm saddened. RIP Taylor Hawkins. We lost one of the best drummers in the world, a thought for his loved ones.
Hey bro R.I.P Taylor Hawkins respect love prayers for your family God bless your soul big homey
The Dream Widow album is good. "The Sweet Abyss" is the best song.
This world right now is a nightmare, now he can feel good. wherever he is, we'll miss him.  🎵🤍 Love and strength for his family and friends.
Two o’s in Colombia. Rest in peace, Taylor.
Saddening day. He was such an energetic, truly positive guy. Rest In Peace. 💔
Dave...what shock,devastation, and a forever broken heart for his brother like no other.
Narcotics Bad......
I’m absolutely gutted. What a legend of a musician.. RIP Taylor, I’ll miss you  mate..
Gutted, love to the Foo Family 💔
Gone way too soon.
another victim of the jab.
This sucks.
Devastated. RIP Taylor, thanks for all the great shows. The Foo’s won’t be the same without him.
Dude seemed way too young.
This is not good, I'm crushed. F****CK! My condolences to the family of Taylor Hawkins and the members of the Foo Fighters. RIP Taylor.
RIP Taylor.....f'n sad news, 50 - what a waste, what a tragedy.....
Another healthy man dies at 50... Vaccinedamage? Sick of hearing excuses now so many young men die months after vaxx and people saying it's not because of that!  RIP dude! I loved your energy!!!
El Jabbo strikes again........
Just woke up to this news - absolutely gutted  , he was just far too young to go . Rest in peace you legend !!!
Pfizer and coke ain't no joke!💔
Tragic. And he just celebrated his 50th birthday a month ago..
Please don't let this be another OD.
Take the vaccine, get heart blocking clots. People as young as 5 have died of heart attacks thanks to pfizer.
died in Columbia. was it drugs? or something else?
NOOOOOOOO!  RIP Taylor.
Drug addiction is a terrible, terrible monster. My prayers to his family and friends.
Dam now we lost two good drummers Joey and Taylor
I don't understand why he would bailout on the band.
The shit don't stop till the casket drops. Legalize all the drugs. Safe dosages, eliminate black market, crime, and corruption.
Let me guess he took the jab
A sad, sad day. I’ve seen The Foos several times with Taylor Hawkins behind the skins and he just radiated energy. I have no words to describe the loss his family and friends must be feeling. He will be missed greatly.
RIP Taylor.
Ty for the news. Wonder what he died of. 50 is the heart attack zone. Pay attention to your health or you will miss the big show. Your gonna want to see this trust me. It's gonna feel like a sci movie we are living in reality.
Great guy great drummer/entertainer Thoughts go to family Please stop insinuating how he died Sadly we will know soon
Dave Ghoul has his blood on his hands.
Just found out through Wolfie’s instagram post……… WHAT?! 💔😭 devastating! Sending love and condolences to…….Everyone.💔
😞❤
I love drugs too taylor.... hell ya man... living life to fullest ... have a good one
Shame….  But that’s rock n roll baby….keep on rockin’!!  Celebrate Taylor, remember him, but keep on rockin’!!!
wtf... I have no words...
There will never EVER be another drummer like him, rather a person like him. Dude, wherever you are slap that snare, keep playing in our souls. Love you Taylor.  Rest in peace. 💜
RIP Taylor...wow....
the like i put on this video isnt because i liked it. its to show respect for Taylor. RIP
Maybe he's jamming with Jimi,Kurt,Janis,Jim etc..rest in peace Taylor..much Love
great drummer rip
Holy, shit. WTF? RIP
When you cry yourself to sleep knowing music has lost a great one...how???
It's always too soon and too young. For those about to rock we salute you Taylor. Rock in peace man.
Another one found dead in a motel room. Hmmmmmmm????
The released statement  from the band says nothing about the death. No what, why,  nor how...
Do the jabby jab
Taylor and Dave are the reason I play drums. Two of my favorite drummers in the same band. Completely saddened and baffled. Rip🥁
The "visualizer" for the new single "Cold" has a beating heart spinning in front of a unicursal hexagram with skulls super imposed over it - after his drummer just dropped from a heart attack. Very cool coincidence guise \m/. Anyway, don't forget to take your fauci ouchi!
So did he OD, or what? They found him dead in his hotel room, but I guess he could have had a heart attack or something. He did have a history of abuse. That's for certain.
Amazing human this is sad. He has sober for 20 yrs I wonder what happened.  Stroke from the vaccine?
omg im so surprised a few days ago i watched studio 666 where the whole band died in that movie as a joke for the story of the movie  ....but for real man this is such a downer he was a killer drummer being a drumer better than davbe in his own band is a feat of no lightness im glad he has a lasting legacy RIP Taylor.
Rest in peace Taylor Hawkins...prayers for your family
Sadly he struggle whit the needle in his past
💉💉💉💉
We will miss you Taylor 🕊🤘
Anyone know if he got the Clot shot?
This doesn't feel real..
Rock in peace dude
Poor choices. Chose drugs over his kids. Laters
Rest in Peace brother
😢😢😢
The foo fighters are gay
I am broken hearted over this. He was a great one.
This hurts so bad… last time I cried was Chester and now him…I have no words. 😢
RIP Taylor! My condolences to his family, friends and the band. This such sad and blindsiding news.
Damn,   This is so sad.  RIP Taylor, thank you for your music. 💔
double vaxxed and boosted?
Blown away such a cool dude I had the pleasure to have meet him back in 2002...Never a moment did he douche out he was a totally normal dude rock star persona never just a regular good Ol'boy...so sad man rest easy broski...
Clot shot? 💉
I’m at a loss for words. So very sorry. I don’t understand.. what happened. ?? I always thought he was a dear of a  man , though I never met him or seen him perform.  Sending my condolences 💐.
when my dad told me, i thought it was a joke because of studio 666 but no. R.I.P legend
He was only 50 gone too soon
Such a sad loss!! Condolences and prayers 🙏to his family,friends,band and fans!! One of the baddest drummers ever and your legacy will live on!! RIP Taylor 🤘
Damnnm.....he seemed so cool
The vax another victim
First question, did he get the vaccine?  And if he did that is where i would first start my investigation as to the cause.
Horrible news. Drum In Peace Taylor :(
Just devastated by this loss. Taylor was such a bright light, and incredible drummer, one of the best ever. My deepest condolences to his wife and family, Dave and the rest of the Foos, and the millions of Foos fans across the world. He’s part of that super band in the sky now. 😓🖤
Sorry to hear that. 58 and did expect to be alive this long .40 was old when I was in my 20th you never know most of my friends and family are gone so you never know when you'll be the last man standing. R.I.P BROTHER
So sorry to hear. My thoughts and prayers go out to Taylor Hawkins family and friends RIP
Pfizer
Taylor was one of my top 5 favorite drummers and The Pretender was the song that got me hooked on rock music and he made me want to start drumming. RIP Taylor Hawkins😕
Fuckin gutted!
I f*kin HATE waking up to days like today.  Taylor was an amazing person and drummer... RIP Brother.  You are gonna be greatly missed.
What's the cause of his death? ...
The Foo Pfizers pushed masks and the clot shot, Tyler must have been triple jabbed.
WTF??? Not Taylor! 😭😭😭 The guy was one of the best damn drummers out there.
Sad...
The Truth is a  National Security Risk
Wtf!!!!
For me Charlie Watts at 80 was hard. Taylor Hawkins at 50 is unbearable
Keep getting your vaccines . . .
You too can have a heart attack!!!!!
I've been sobbing since I woke up and heard the news this morning. RIP king
Sending condolences is a good thing but a lot of people on the comments are really saying “don’t forget about me today” stop it
Fly high man. Fly High. 🤘
Keep getting those shots kids.
Holy Shit.
R.i.p Taylor Hawkins you were a great drummer great person and role model
F...
Had crabs
Wtf!!!!
Oh my, only found  out thus morning that Taylor Hawkins has died,and so young age,  well my heart goes out to his family and his band mates, the Foo Fighters.
Such a damn shame to start my spring break. RIP Taylor.. Gone but never forgotten..
We all pfall down :(
So young
Man poor Dave. He lost Kurt already and now Taylor aswell
WTF!!!!???? This just came up on my feed! Noooooo!! Absolutely devastated 😢. I'm sick to my stomach.
Rip Taylor ....
So sad condolenses to fam
Sad. All the best to Taylor's family and friends. Great drummer. I love The Coattail Riders.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!! I can't express how badly I feel for his fam and the Foos... wow...
Good old vaccine doing its thing again
3naboostr?
People, do your research properly!!!! It’s not Columbia. It’s Colombia!!!! Please!!! There’s no “U” in Colombia. Get it right! Always the same mistake everywhere. Jesus. It’s not hard. Europeans get it right and they’re an ocean away. You are in the same continent as COLOMBIA and STILL can’t get it right
Damn man 😔. Another musical inspiration gone way to soon! RIP Taylor 💔🙏🏻
i didn’t want to wake up to this man rip  (hope dave continues foo fighters)
I’m gonna speculate and guess it’s another senseless drug-related death of a celebrity who was pretty much living the good life. That’s rock and roll for ya.
I grew up listening to foo fighters now I’m never gonna listen to them the same again
Vaccine Victim ..
Just terrible...
Covid vaccine?
Prayers for His family and band mates he was very charismatic musician/performer and will be missed.
R.I.P
Damn it..... Dude is a beautiful person...... Rock in peace Taylor. My condolences to his family and the Foo Fighters. Sad sad day 😭
Rip Taylor Hawkins rip 😢😢😢😢😢🥺🥺🥺🥺
It's times like these you learn to live again It's times like these you give and give again It's times like these you learn to love again It's times like these time and time again   - Foo Fighters.
The jab?🤔
Wonder if it was a OD
Well that’s some shitty news to wake up to this morning! RIP
At my age a lot of the musicians from my youth pass away but not only is this terrible News but it is made worse because he was so young which makes it so horribly wrong .  R.I.P
It's Colombia not Columbia. RIP
Man what a bummer, my condolences to his family.
I send love and strong healing power to his family and friends. He was a great drummer but very sure he was a much better son father husband and friend. He is rocking out for Jesus now amen!
Vaxxed?
Sorry but Nickleback choose the wrong photo. RIP Taylor
Wow, and His solo records are waaaay better than Foo Fighters in my opinion
@0:58 ColOmbia, not Columbia you idiots! RIP Taylor
🤯
Dam
Did he died?
*Fuck man😔*
take the shot and get the clot
I was supposed to them at Welcome to Rockville in May, unbelievably tragic and he will be forever missed! FOO FOREVER!
I feel bad for Taylor and his family.l also feel bad for Dave, it's the second friend he has lost in his career. Hang in there Foo fighters. R.I.P. Mr Hawkins.
Davastated, respect to the FOO FIGHTERS and his family, and IT´s COLOMBIA
Nice tribute/update  Well said   Rip Taylor   I haven't even gotten to see studio 666 yet.
god bless him he had the heart of rock n roll and the soul of a poet. condolences to his family.
RIP😔🙏
May he Rest in Peace😔....huge loss...prayers for his wife, kids, family and fans....
Another amazing musician passing  this is the down side of social media. Finding out fast about untimely passings
Clot shot... Shouldnt have injected anything in ya. But break an egg. Make an omelet
Maybe Dave shouldn't have pushed the poison shot, err vaccine so hard. Sounds like another casualty.
WHAT!! This sucks he was an amazing guy, drummer, and singer.
What???
I hope he was not messing with that raw dog down there in Columbia
To say I’m heartbroken is an understatement. Damn I’m really feeling this one.
RIP Taylor, my condolences go out to his family and friends.
All within a 12 month period we lost a great metal drummer Joey Jordinson. Now we lost a great rock drummer. Taylor Hawkins. So unbelievabley sad. Taylor had so much fun and energy playing. Devastated by this.
News broke around midnight last night. At first i thought it was a hoax. Sad to hear the news, i just hope he didn't die from drugs. RIP Taylor.
So sad ,he was a great drummer . Rip bro .
WTF?!
Heartbroken
I was watching their Troubadour fundraiser concert at the end of Times Like These when my wife told me.  When I went back to Times Like These, he was gone.  My heart breaks for Dave and the Foos as well as his loved ones.
RIP TAYLOR. My condolences to his family, including Dave.who’s gotta be devastated.
Heartbroken..As a Fellow Drummer this hits me in the Heart
just crazy.  i saw foo fighters for the first time finally back in december in vegas.  had always been a fan but hadnt seen them live until then.  was such a fun show
damn I'm going to see their concert soon... RIP brother
Since he was on tour I assume he was "vaccinated" and boosted, any wagers this has something to do with blood clots, stroke or heart damage caused by the mRna?
unreal so sad
So sad. Great drummer and best hair in the game. RIP
Just 3 days ago I was watching him sing 'Under Pressure' from Glastonbury and thinking how cool it would be if he actually sung a full show with Queen one day. It will take some time to accept that he's gone
WTF NO THIS IS HORRIBLE 🙏🏻😪❤⚘ THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS OUR FATHER NEEDED A AMAZING DRUMMER UPSTAIRS...
Im so sad. Damn, you are a true great Taylor, your humble approach to life was inspiring.  Just so sad to see you go Taylor, rest in peace brother.
Food Fighters are Trump's favorite campaign band!
Another one lost too soon
Food Fighters number 1!
Still in shock omg such huge loss Foo Fighters fans family deepest condolences sympathies from Canada God Bless❤️❤️❤️
All u fools speculating Dave's as upfront of a dude as can be. U'll know the TRUTH soon enough. Whether u are a fan or not the FOOs are the biggest ROCK band of the last 25 years. FACTS !!! 🎊🎉🎊
I'm devastated with sadness now.  That will change to anger if this comes back as OD.  I hope that is not the case, but Hawkins stepped close to the edge on tour before many years ago.
Devastating and heartbreaking. Miss him so much. He always seemed have an infectious joy about him especially when playing
Absolutely devastating.  My heart and love go out to his family and friends.  RIP Taylor,....
It was from the vax.
He going to be missed
Wow! Terrible news. Taylor was a badass. Better find out who slipped him a Mickey.
That’s what the ( v a c c I n e ) will do to ya, same with all the soccer players dropping ( d e a d ) on the field from their hearts racing, that spike protein clogs the arteries up the faster your blood pumps, it’s just a matter of time before it gets ya...
so strange right after that movie; altitude sickness? Or jab side effects? hmmmm
This seriously sucks. BAD! R.I.P. Taylor. The world is a bit darker without you in it
What the heck ia going on out there? Like too many incidents like this. Something is not right. This is not normal. So sad for family, friends and fans.
It's funny how the illuminati killed Cobain because of Courtney LOVES involvement in human trafficking, then boom Taylor Hawkins shows up hmm seems like more illuminati crap. Colombia home of the CIA or the COCAINE IMPORT AGENCY AS WELL AS A HUB FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING MONIES AND MORE. LETS NOT FORGET THE MAYANS WHOM ARE THE FOUNDATIONS FOR MS13 WHICH ARE RUN BY THE CIA AND OTHER POLITICAL ELITES. WATCHING THE FREEMASONIC KAZARIAN ELITES KILLING EACH OTHER OFF IS AMAZZZZING.
✌️♥️🎶☯️🖖😣
This is just devssting! I am shook but this! Taylor was my fav! & was listening to them yesterday as always!...😭 RIP Taylor
No way!!
Crazy ! Dave better hang up foo fighters. Not the same without him. Band just lost a core of its character.
Gone way to soon.R.I.P. BROTHER
He w@s tr!pple v@xxed, so he pr0b@bly d!ed of clim@te ch@nge.
May God  comfort his family, band members.
The last couple years we as rockers have lost alot of great artist that we all love to watch so sad RIP Taylor you will go down as the greatest drummer in food fighters history
We needed him so much love you brother! !!-
This blow so much 😔😭😔😭awesome brilliant drummer this suck
sad day for rock fans around the world  RIP Taylor, U DID it all
Shouldn’t have shilled for the 💉 so hard
Chest pains huh, R.I.P..... Pfizer, Moderna or J&J
Rest in Peace Taylor Hawkins, Truly a great musician who was taken way too soon :-(
The Foo Fighters had a lot of songs that I liked but they had even more that I dislike. With that being said, they really paid their way and Dave Grohl worked hard to get where he was after Nirvana. This is really shocking and sad to see. It really shocked me I hate to hear it. Thoughts and prayers to his family and loved ones and all the fans that his music is also helped. I'm a music lover and I know how certain bands have helped me through life
First Kurt now Taylor poor Dave .Great drummer Rip Taylor Hawkins.
Bogota? Cocaine
First Dave loses Kurt, and was somehow able to pick up the pieces. Now he loses Taylor, I can't even imagine his devastation...I don't know if he can come back from this. Prayers
Take fake vaccine, win stupid prizes
Rest in peace,  wait a tragedy
Jab victim
Dave Grohl ,  was the first drummer for the Foo Fighter , so Taylor was the third drummer .  What very sad news that Taylor passed away
RIP Taylor Hawkins You Can Play In Heaven With All The Greatest Drummers BONHAM Play With The Angels My Condolences To You And Your Family 🙏🙏🙏🥁🥁🥁💔💔💔😎
I would love if a tv channel had Rock News like this. Like actual news broadcasts solely focused on the rock scene. But besides that, R.I.P.
I just can’t believe it. I had the pleasure of seeing him play 3 times. Just such a cool and talented guy. Always smiling behind his kit. I’m shocked 💚💔
No.
OMG that dude was so young and seemed so healthy and just full of life whenever I would see videos or interviews of him!!! What could he have possibly died from so suddenly??? Poor Dave man he is gonna have a hard time getting over this one, those two seemed like brothers.
this is a reoccurring theme PEOPLE. young healthy individuals being found dead in bed I just did a job for a woman who's husband wouldn't wake up after massive heart attack in middle of the night
Courtney killed him.
There you go sport…..finished the job….good little worker.
wonder if it was a heart attack from the thing they were forcing fans to have in order to enter their concerts
Incredibly sad to hear this devastating news. Taylor was an unbelievable drummer and I will never forget those insane concerts, RIP🤘
Jib Jab
NOOOO
Rip
It is so sad.... He passed away in Colombia 🇨🇴 The problem is that the narco-dictator Uribe converted 🇨🇴 into a box of dru£s and it became so dangerous no one is safe anymore.
This is heartbreaking. Dave and Taylor were the dynamic duo and best friends. I've been a Foo Fighter fan since the first cd that Dave made mostly alone. My heart and prayers go out to the Foos, family and friends. RIP Taylor one of the best drummers ever
Rest in peace Taylor . . . . God bless your family & friends.
May God bless and keep Taylor and may he grant peace and serenity to his band mates, family and friends during their time of grief. My deepest condolences to Dave, the band and Taylor's family.
2+2
Oh no. Hate to wake up to this news. What a great drummer. Always looked happy.
Oh no. Poor Dave. Dammit!! Prayers for Taylor's Family in this time.
WHAT THE HELL?
You anti-vaxxers can say what you like, but at least he never got the sniffles. He died sniffleless and that's what matters.
The star that burns twice as bright will shine half as long.
I am so thankful I got to see Foo play in December it is now more of a treasured memory than it already was. Heartbreaking
I’m still trying to comprehend this tragic news . It’s hard to imagine a guy like Taylor gone . He was full of energy !!!!!!!!!! Now he leaves behind a bunch of broken hearts . Thoughts and Prayers . Rest In Peace Taylor . You will never be forgotten 🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏
It’s a sad day.
Wow in total shock... RIP TH
If you read Dave Grohl's autobiography, you know that Taylor was Dave's absolute best friend. This must be devastating for Dave, no doubt. If this death was related to opiates, all the worse since Dave managed to avoid heroine and cocaine his entire life. I honestly hope this was some natural event and not an overdose.
Rip Taylor
50yo bloody hell. Be interesting to hear the cause of death.
sad 🙏
Trust God.  Our day is never guaranteed.
One of the coolest and talented musician of my generation. Truly one of the best. RIP Taylor
RIP Taylor! Now he can jam with Neil up in drummer heaven! My deepest condolences to his family.
May he rest in peace! Everyone that knows him or met him says he was a down to earth and humble person.
Wow I recently started to listen to the Foo’s the last year and change. Dave and Pat have lost two greats together, stay strong God Bless.
RIP Taylor Hawkins...what a loss. It's sad man, a great loss for all of us especially Dave.
This sucks.
V@xxed
I know he had problems with heroin...
Rip legend. Have fun with Dio 🤘🏼
😮 ☹ 😪
Can't believe this!!!!! RIP Taylor Hawkins  Much love to his family, friends and fans alike!!!!!!
Stop saying "gutted". It's lame.
Sad...RIP. 🙏✌
I have intentionally avoided this issue for a long time, but now I am going to say it; I *HATE* when famous people ask for privacy when someone dies. Like, if you wanted privacy for your family when you die, DON'T BECOME FAMOUS!!!! It's so stupid. Also, you are disrespecting your fans when you do that. It's almost like the fans don't matter when you pass away. I would love to meet the person who came up with that just so I can strangle him!  /rant over
Damn this really sucks. I can’t believe it. RIP Taylor you will be missed.
Its so painful, he was currently working with dream widow don't know it was his last project with foo...
lately we've lost the best drummers Charlie Watts, Joey Jordison and now we lost Taylor Hawkins 😭 RIP Taylor Hawkins , thank you for all your positive energy & inspired all of us !
One of the best rock n roll drummers in the modern era. Truly sad news to wake up to. God speed to the foo fighters and his family. RIP to an absolute legend
What happened? 50 years old? RIP.
I hate the foo fighters, but he seemed like a great guy.  Rip
Gee wonder why cause of death isn't mentioned, heart attack?  myocarditis? hmmm.   Make sure you get your boosty's kids!
Vaxxed.
He probably never got all the way away from his drug addiction. So very sad. RIP
WTF!!!!!????? Noooooooo!!!
Wow!!!  Very sad...
Wow, 50 years old...wonder what the reason is?
fuck.  rip my dude.
So how did he die?
One word... unbelievable! Rip Taylor
I can't even imagine what Dave is going through right now. My prayers to everyone that was close to him
Fuck no! R.I.P Taylor. You were amazing human being and I wish I could have seen you live this summer like I planned.
Bro COLOMBIA! COLOMBIA! no columbia....
How?  The article said “altitude sickness”?  He was only 50.  This is too sad.
shock, i cant believe it
wow... first Mark Lanegan now Taylor Hawkins.. what a low blow to rock n roll... so sad.. RIP
Woke up to this news. So sad 😢
This sucks! Not only are Foo Fighters one of my all time favorite bands but EVERYTIME you see Taylor he always has a smile on his face and seems genuinely happy.  Really just sad
Wtf.....this sucks so much! It doesn't make any logical sense. Guys like him are supposed to last forever. We protect and stand up for guys like that. He was a blonde Dave Grohl, this has to suck for him, hearts and prayers.
Hasta la Vista. Bebe.
Many hearts broken today!....What a wonderful human being he was
My favorite drummer in the world! RIP Taylor.. 😞Thank you for all the music and good times!!🤘🏻😔
R.i.p
Way to young. May God bless his family and friends. Rip Taylor Hawkins
Vaccinated??
How many people wake up everyday and take a moment to care and think about the people that will die to day that are not famous not many people will care I'm  sorry he died but  we can't care just because he's was famous it  doesn't make hem special. did he do what God want hem to do when he was here no people don't play with your life  repent and be born again and come to Jesus so u can have eternal life when you die  None of this stuff  Matters
Lets get cocine rockers assholes
The drumming community just lost one of our coolest brothers. He is one with the cosmic geometry now. His vibrations will live on. I'm always a little jealous but my time will come soon enough. Be good to each other out there boys and girls.
A huge loss; one of the most talented drummers of all time.  He wasn't just Alanis's drummer, he was like a little brother to her. I hope her, Dave, Taylor's family, and all his other loved ones are holding up ok
Absolutely devastating--such a great personality; talent; human.
Hell of a way to wake up, this breaks my heart.
No fkn way! I cannot believe it! My heart goes out to all you guys. Taylor's family and the band. The universe has a bad ass drummer. They better take care of him!
Hell of a way to wake up, this breaks my heart.
a sad loss guys!
WHAT ! OMG WHAT THE HELL HAPPEND ?
💙 🇬🇧
Drugs? Really good drugs?
Damn this hurts rest in peace Tyler
RIP Taylor
Poor Dave :( you know hes just got to be devastated
Noooo this can’t be happening! Please this is a joke right
I’m afraid to find out why this happened. The sad thing is, it seems like more often than not it’s one of two things…self harm or overdose. This was a sore bit of news to wake up to 😞  Thanks for doing what you do Rock Feed. You’re one of my most favorite creators..I admire what you’ve built
He’s in a better place.
Never saw this coming. Good people die young
Damn I just can't believe it, so much talent, so many people who truly loved him. I feel so bad for his family, and I can't imagine what Dave is feeling right now.
damnit!!!!  NOOOOOO
This screams the question... was he cov vaccinated? RIP 🙏
Way Way Way too soon - Absolutely gutted beyond words. Rest in peace Taylor. 😞
I can only assume all the teeth-bleaching finally caught up with him. Acute tooth-bleach poisoning?
Guarantee he took the vaccine. What a horrible and unnecessary loss.
Brought to you by Pfizer.
Shocking!!
This is so sad, feel so terrible for his family & kids. Dave Grohl has now lost two best friends in Taylor & Kurt. Sad day. A Drumming legend
RIP
God Bless Him and you all from Jesus Christ and myself
I am in a state of utter disbelief. Condolences, thoughts and prayers to his family and his fellow Foos. There are no words.
One of my favorite things about Foo Fighters in general is they played Jazz Fest a LOT. And Voodoo Fest occasionally, both festivals native to New Orleans. They played in New Orleans a lot as they loved the city. This is how I was able to see them so many times. They were even scheduled to play Jazz Fest in a month from now and I doubt that isn't going to happen as a result of this. I can't see how anyway. But one of my favorite memories of Taylor from when they played these shows is actually the one time I remember them playing Voodoo Fest and he had apparently gone to a local Walgreens earlier in the day and bought these ridiculous leopard print tights for like $5 or something he said and he decided to wear them during the show. It was hilarious. He kept getting up from his kit and dancing on the stage in between songs to show off his tights and honestly it was the most rock and roll thing in the world. I am sure you can find footage of this if you look up Foo Fighters at Voodoo Fest, it was probably some time around 2014 or 2015 or thereabouts. I forget the exact year. But yeah go look that up if you want to see what I am talking about, it's hilarious lol RIP Taylor Hawkins
Just gutted...got to see Taylor and the FF in 2019 before Covid...we almost didn't because thunderstorms rolled thru but we stuck around and so did the Foos...will cherish that concert forever. RIP Taylor
Need Autopsy!! No conspiracies but, conspiracy Analysis and Most of All truth!! R.I.P and big heart cushioning hugs to family!!
I was just reminiscing the time from Alanis onward to now, I have no words for how much of an impact he had. 💔
It’s really saddens me to hear this news. My best guess is that it was heart failure. I also had a heart attack about eight years ago and I thought it was the flu. I’m glad that I was near a hospital when it happened but It can take you very suddenly And with absolutely no warning
Rip taylor 🥺😭
This is some of the worst news to wake up to. Goddamni what an IMMENSE loss. 😢💔
RIP 🥁 Everlong
Grohl made the band get the 💉 even though Taylor was against it.
I am so sorry to hear that Taylor died.  He was so young.  One of the best drummers in the world.  Taylor was always smiling!  I will miss his beautiful smile.  My deepest condolences to Dave Grohl and all the other members of the Foo Fighters and his wife and children.  May he rest in peace.
Shit it's terrible..such a loveable guy ..what the fuck happened??...Dave just lost his best buddy ever..love you Dave love you taylor ❤ 🥁🎶RIP 🙏
Rest in Peace Taylor
I have no words
Perfectly safe...highly effective  !
way too young, my condolences to family and friends.
They used the common cold to trick the masses to take their depop-shot
Colombia is a nation.  Columbia is a school in New York.
So sad, he was magic on the drums. Fly Taylor, soar to a place of peace and know you are already missed and our hearts are heavy for your family...you have now gone way above the bonds of earth to a wonderful place  in the heavens where all great musicians go to play through out eternity.
So sad, he loved what he did and seemed to love life in general, just wow, nothing more to say except thank you Taylor for your contribution to the music world you'll be missed.
I bet the jab got him.
I want this too be so untrue. I'm so broken.
Dang. He was like Dave's little brother. It's very sad about the Foo family.
Wow we are shocked in uder disbelief, taking way to young my prayers 🙏 to his wife and children family and friends ❤ you will be greatly missed we have lost another master musician may his spirit rhane forever ❤ to the foo fighter bandmates sorry for the loss of your friend, we are all greatly saddened from this loss,rock on 🤘 ❤ 🙏 💙
Damn....bad news. RIP Taylor until we meet again.
Wow...............Sorry David Grohl,family & band members
Much respect to an amazing drummer.  RIP.💜🤘
I cried so hard this morning , this is so unfortunate so horribly tragic . 50 is to young , his musicianship will never be matched or replaced
WTF man. Rock in peace Taylor!
You do know it's Colombia, right? Not "Columbia". Come on now.
R.I.P
I met him on that 1st tour circa 1997 right after his set.  He was super nice, but smelled terrible. Lol. One of my inspirations as a drummer!! 🍻
Whaaaaaat? How, why? This is awful news, such a cool guy and amazing drummer. RIP see you on the other side.
play stupid games 💉  win stupid prizes 💀
This is terrible. Taylor Hawkins was like Dave Grohl's second in command and basically always has been for the band, you see him in like every interview they've ever done and if there's only two band members being interviewed it's always either Dave and Taylor OR Taylor and someone else in the band. If you've ever seen them live and I've seen them live several times now (and I am happy I did while he was still with us but to be clear I never would have expected he'd be the first to go) most of the banter is between Dave and Taylor. Like, this band will never be the same because this happened. He was a phenomenal drummer, a hilarious person, and honestly like a personality on top of that which is kind of rare when it comes to drummers who are almost always just in the background and happy to be there. This is a terrible day for Rock and Roll. I can't believe he was only 50, he looks like he's been 25 basically his entire life and career. RIP Taylor Hawkins, God this sucks so hard.
Rest in piece my brother ❤️
How?
I’m absolutely shattered. He survived his OD, got clean and now he’s dead at 50…. Mortality is so upsetting. RIP Taylor, you were a true legend 💔
Jesus things couldn’t get worse and then the world loses him. It’s worse.
Wait, so David has had two close friends musicians die? Was he the guy from nirvana I can't remember? ?  So my condolences definitely to David as well
I am so sad, heartbroken! TAYLOR May You Rest In Peace🕊! I can't process this loss! Thank You So Much For Your Talent And Great Music You Created! FOO FIGHTERS is my favorite Rock 🎸🥁 band starting in the mid 90's! My Deepest Condolences To Your Family, The Band, Friends! Your Music And Spirit Lives And Will Live In Me As Well As In Every FOO FiGHTERS's Fan And Beyond!!!
Wow this hurts. His infectious smile up there on stage while playing drums is going to greatly missed. RIP Taylor Hawkins 😢
Foo fighters is a great band but Taylor Hawkins drumming was amazing it’s sucks that he passed away rip Taylor Hawkins you will never be forgotten
50 that's it!?  Wtf happened?
Such a gut punch.
Rest in peace brother and keep rockin  in the heavens.
Gonna be another drug overdose more than likely
I knew something bad had happened when I saw all the food fighters albums up high on the Amazon chart sad day rip Taylor you are still awesome
That colombian coke is very strong! You cannot snore it like you would in NY. Legendary drummer that partied hard! He didn't miss a beat rest in peace!
I dont care for the foo fighters but i like taylor hawkins killer drummer nice guy. Rest in peace.
Rest In Peace dear mate 🕊 ❤️ 🎸
Another hero, God I hate this. My deepest condolences to Hawkins' family, friends, and band is mates
WOOW!! R.I.P TAYLOR HAWKINS💪🏽🙏🏽 dave gotta be going through it
As a Fort Worth born myself this hit me with surprise and feeling... Foo Fighters is always going to be an alternative band I need when feeling down. They give their all for their fans... rip Hawkins!! 🤘🏻💙😔
Fair winds and following seas, Taylor Hawkins.  Thank you for sharing your gift.   You are missed 🤍  Love, Peace, and Healing to the Hawkins and Foo Fighters families.  Joy to a life well lived 🤘❤🤘
Drug overdose likely
✌🏻😢 way to way too young rip T.H.
R.I.P BROTHER TAYLOR  I liked your work all the way from the Alanis morsette days
This is unbelievable we lost another soldier has fallen and will be missed R.I.P.
It's going to get worse, much worse..... RIP brother, thanks for the memories
Not the news I thought I would wake up to today. This group has been such an influential part of my life on so many levels. Taylor’s personality and love for all those around him was amazing to watch. He was definitely one of a kind and will be truly missed by everyone. RIP Taylor.
Dark Arts. Studio 666.
Totally devastated 😩😭
This is heavy man 😞
At my age u get used to your heroes passing and it sucks, but this one was younger than me, such a shame
I'm sorry Dave! RIP Talor!
WTF 🥺
Taylor was awesome can’t believe he’s gone so sorry for your loss my heart goes out  to his family
🤘😔🤘
I can't believe it. I'm devastated. As an amateur drummer, music lover, FF lover, Taylor is one of my greatest references. I was so excited to see them live in Madrid next June... His legacy and his laughter will be in our hearts forever. My condolences to his family, Dave and the FF family.
Was he vaccinated?
Awful  our condolences to a bad ass band.
I’d put money down, dope or complications there of.
I remember in the 90s i saw him for the first time when he was the drummer of Alanis Morrisette, pure nostalgia, RIP.
I met Taylor once. Really cool bloke. Sad news.
The Daily Mail is reporting that Bogota police are saying it was overdose. Typically when it's stated as being "untimely and unexpected," many times it's overdose or...self-inflicted. RIP.
This one hurts. A lot. Utter disbelief. Thank you for the years of music and memories Taylor. You will be missed. 😞
Bet it was blood clots! Many more to come. Let's go Brandon!
Sad day for rock n roll
while im not their biggest fan its still a huge loss for such a big drummer
Happy Sabbath everyone. Blessings to his family.
I just saw him in Australia. They were the first band to tour after our lock-down. I'm devastated. Taylor is a God.
My deepest condolences going out to his wife and kids, his band mates, and all of his fans around the world. To quote Chris Cornell, "Say hello to heaven." RIP Taylor. 🙏
What a great dude. RIPercussion Taylor
Well well well. Boosta!
well that´s it, no more foo fighters
T's and p's all around
Wtf is happening in this world
Rest in peace. His family and band members is in my prayers. One of the best drummers in my lifetime. I am in SHOCK!!!
R.I.P. Your contributions to music will live forever.
Fuck, Tyler! Can't believe it....
WTF
WTF
Much thoughts and prayers to his family
WTF!!!😫😫😫
Didn't he just get the covid 19 shot??🤔
Sad news. Commiserations. He achieved a lot in his short life. All the best to his family, friends and fans. RIP.
RIP 🥁 💔
This was about the last thing I wanted to wake up to. I hope he went peacefully.
I'm literally sick 😫 and I am so worried about the boys, especially Dave of course.  This is unbelievable.
One of my biggest inspirations now gone. Never got to see him play in person. Wont be playing anything but foo fighters these past days.
This makes no sense, how
What a shock,, great player, very sad..
OMG....thats horrible.
Colombia 🇨🇴
Very sad to hear. Love from Bangor Northern Ireland
Always a hotel
Taylor Hawkins you brought a light that no one can replace....R.I.P. BROTHER
Gutted, cried - still dont know what to say
shocking
Another  MRNA shot statistic?
Went back to H....again. No worries...it was destiny, amazing he lasted this long imo
I know this is completely off topic but, when I heard that Joey Jordison had died, it was like losing a family member. 8 months later after his death, I Hera about Taylor Hawkins. I literally have no words. I’m extremely depressed and I’m just heartbroken. I can’t believe I woke up to this message while trying to take a shit. This is just devastating man.
This hurts me I send my condolences to his family an his brothers The Foo Fighters. Thank you for your awesome years of  work now I have to see Studio 666 the movie .R.I.P Taylor you’ll sorely be missed you’ll never be forgotten rest easy🙏😇🥁🕊
One of the best drummer of the last 30 years my music hero great Foo Fighters spot died today is a great sadness to me :(   RIP Taylor Hawkins You Never Be Forgotten Best Of You In Heaven ♥️🥁🎼🎵🎶
Vax
Wtf……….The world it music will no longer be the same, a total legend 🙏
Another has left us so soon R.I.P. Brother 🤘😪🤘🙏
Unreal, incredible drummer. Tragic R.I.P Taylor
I’m speechless! He was our generations Bonzo. What a talent and he will be terribly missed by his friends, family, and fans alike. I’m too shocked to even shed a tear right now. My thoughts and prayers go out to the whole band and especially Dave because I know they were the best of friends. 50....... Rest In Power Taylor Hawkins. You can only be imitated and never replaced!
Just waking up to this sad news! Prayers for his family... friends and fans!
RIP (Rock In Peace) Taylor.
I cannot believe this news ,absolute heartbreaking ,rip Taylor
One of the smoothest, coolest people. Damn. This sucks.
Did he take a certain medical procedure a few times........??
I just can't believe it, RIP Taylor Hawkins you will be missed.
Rest in peace man
May God send His guardian angels to watch over Taylor's family, friends and FF mates. How incredibly heartbreaking. 😔🙏
NO!! Just in disbelief. Deep condolences from us here. Taylor was an outstanding and amazing drummer. He was also an even better person.
So sad to hear this news. A big loss in the music world. RIP TH. Reminded me how much fun and work it is being a drummer. Thank you for giving me back my passion for drumming and music.
Is it new 27 club? So many rock and metal heads are dying at 49 and this is happening when they look at least 20 years younger, that is so sad.
RIP Taylor Hawkins you are an inspiration and will be missed.
just woke up to this!! so unbelievable! he was always smiling! so sad.😭
I'm just getting over Mark Lanegan's passing and now this??!!!!! I heard it earlier today but dismissed it as fake news. He ODd many years ago and was brought back to us for a lot more years of his loving, humble self but to lose him for good.....it's devastating. I was just watching the 60 Minutes interview of him and Dave then this tragic news comes on. Too many greats of ours are passing away and it's just not getting any easier to hear.  Rock In Peace, Taylor. Your greatness will remain a fixture in the Rock world.xX💜💜💜💜
R.I.P Taylor ⚘️🕯
He seems like the kind of guy that no one in the industry had a bad word to say about and a lot of people went out of their way to say good things about. Just so tragic.
This is hitting me so hard.  My heart is broken, especially when I think about Dave.  Much love to Foo and Taylor's family . Taylor had so much love and fire of spirit.  Thank you for the music 🖤🙏🖤
Wow……Very sad loss.
I am not a Foo  Fighters fan  but this  sucks..too young
Крутая группа. Крутая музыка. Жаль... Вечная память!!!
Rest easy Taylor❤ Love and light to his wife and children and family 😢 A true loss to the world and music. Much healing to Dave and the band❤
Everlong drumming brought me to the Foo Fighters, and the lyrics sting really bad right now. Rest easy my brother.
He always looked so young and healthy too, rest in piece.
wtf happened?
Poor Dave Grohl. He lost his friend Kurt in the 90s now he loses his friend Taylor this morning 😕.
It was not quite pleasant to live on this planet nowadays, but to wake up to these news, god,  it`s even more difficult in the absence of Taylor. Rest in Peace!
What the heck happened?
Terrible completely Terrible 😪 Great drummer
Maybe he fractured his skull and went to sleep and died
This is beyond sad, but the people who comment it’s the vaccine/ he’s a drug addict can definitely fuck off!!! Let people celebrate his life and mourn his loss.
RIP
It's Colombia, not Columbia.
Never heard a bad comment on him as a human being, everyone always had a nice thing to say about him as a person and that's what makes this the saddest. His drumming will live on forever, it's just sad we lost a wonderful person. Peace to his family and bandmates!
This really sucks and I am sad for his family that he left behind too soon.
This is such shocking news... 😢
Im absolutely heartbroken ive got tickets for foo fighters in nz for December and was so exited to see them all now its a different vibe
Devastated by this news. So sad for Dave and his family. He was one of a kind and a true force.
Get ready. More of this to come....and you know why. People dropping like flies.
rest in peace my bro! my condolences to your family and frineds!
I can’t believe this
I can't believe it. I've never expected this. A legend. I don't know for what was this. Rest In Peace Taylor Hawkins
RIP
Fuck, this. Man this hurts. RIP Taylor😢😢
Strong feeling it was the jab.
So so sad
the columbian powder got him. 🌨
That's such a young age
This 1 really hurts
Omg, what happened? This isn’t supposed to happen to 50 year olds!!
Wow I just watch that new foo movie yesterday
So sad, such a major loss. RIP brother you have an amazing legacy. One the greatest ever and your music brought me so much joy!!
RIP and respects even though Foo Fighters have always been a ridiculously mediocre band.
Don't do drugs Kids, or unproperly tested Vaccines.
Holy shit…horrible
Whaaaaaas? Is this real?
I bet he just got his clot shot recently.
😢❤️🕯️❤️🙏
Does anybody know what happened?
Unreal, what a loss. One big facet of the Foo’s, irreplaceable. So sorry for his family, Dave and the rest of the band.
Just saw this, so sad: terrible loss of a great person and musician: RIP The Foo Fighters will never be the same…
WTF.
R.I.P. 😕
My condoleances to his family and friends ♥️this is a blow for music.he was an inspitation and amazing drummer!you will be missed dearly
This is really sad news.  This hurts me to the core.  The Foo Fighters are my favorite band and Taylor Hawkins was the heart and soul of the group.  Because of guys like them, im a guitarist myself. This is beyond shocking, and I know Dave Grohl is taking it really hard. I’m really heartbroken. My prayers go out to Taylor’s family.  This is a huge loss.  RIP brother. 🥺😢💔🙏🏾
RIP Taylor Hawkins you utter legend.
Wow! How sad. My condolences to his family and friends.
Damn. RIP legend.
RIP Taylor 🙏🏻
As a fellow recovering heroin and fentanyl addict.....as was Taylor.....i felt a connection.....and I dont want to jump to conclusions......but....ive lost 42 people in my personal life to that disease.....FORTY TWO. Regardless of the cause.....so sad. 😔
This was NOT the news that I needed to wake up to…SUCH HORRIBLE NEWS!!! Taylor Hawkins WAS an Amazing Drummer whom you could distinctly HEAR that it was indeed him! I WILL MISS him beyond belief along with his other fans BUT HEY! NOW he has joined the other LEGENDS who have passed away & I can BET that heaven Now has a complete Rockin’ Band (Not to discredit God’s ALREADY stellar band of angels, with their horns & voices)
The band was pushing the shot and boosters hard.  What happened.  He was 50 thin and looked like great shape
Heroin did him in
Duuuuude wtf not what i wanted to wake up To gaaaaah rip taylor such an amazeing drummer rip bro!
Rip Taylor Hawkins a great rock drummer with big dynamism energy and smile very powerful with Alanis too  the only one who could play as good as Dave  he was a true fan of Phil COllins- Chester Thompson -Genesis his kit showed that with high concert toms  as a great fan of Phil - Genesis, the 100% rock band called foo fighters was great for me with this incredible rock drummer i know he had a drugs addiction but we don't know why he is not here anymore goodbye friend, you rock the rock music at 200% like your heroes Bonham Collins  Peart Moon (maybe too)
Every person that dies too young the past year, you know what I am thinking and it ain't covid.
No way.. r.i.p what an awesome guy.
That Vax will eventually get you. Don't be a sucker, don't listen to your TV, celebrities, athletes, etc. Do your own research and think for yourself. Those in high places are counting on you to let them think for you.
cocaine is a helluva a drug rip
I met him in 1996 at Griffith Park Alanis concert his energy on that kit was surreal and Alanis got her vocal edge and confidence from Taylor's high level of 4th dimension aura his drumming kicked the Hollywood Bowl into submission I'm saddened by hearing this just now
Drugs are bad. Very hard on a person the older you get. 50 is the magic number for rockstars.
In shock, I'm playing all the foos albums loud  in respect today and will be having a beer in his honour😔
ColOmbia, it's Colombia. The District of Columbia is in America.
I have no words…..devastating 😢
A video on YouTube already. Have some respect!!!!
ColOmbia...
R.I.P   Taylor ,go and keep Joey and Vinnie company
This is shocking, he was so young!!!! He was incredible, in talent and in humanity 💔
This is the theme of the Metallica album Death Magnetic. There's something about the industry that keeps taking people away. There's probably a part of Dave that will feel like he's lethal to be around. The Foo Fighters will never fully recover from this
So sad... rest in peace Taylor... 😥
So devastated, RIP 🙏 for Foo Fighters, families, and fans 😢😢
This sucks. Dude had an incredible life - got to play drums  with Rush on stage and sing with Led Zeppelin at Wembly Staduim.  Let that sink in. It would be awesome to just get to meet your idols that you grew up listening to, but to get to play with them? Onstage no less? That's taking "living the dream" to an unheard of level.  Rest in peace, brother.
Rip
As a drummer he lost his frontman and as a frontman he lost his drummer.
Complained of chest pains apparently. Strange how so many normally healthy sports people, athletes and super active people (like drummers) are suddenly dropping dead with chest related issues. I wonder how many jabs he'd had?
This is a very heartbreaking and devastating loss. Gone too soon. R.I.P.
One of my favorite and best drummers , my deepest condolences to his family, his band and his friends, R.I.P. Taylor Hawkins
Ugh…
Holy shit. Wow.
I think the devil's dandruff might have played a part in his early demise.
Drug overdose or vaccine overdose!?
You know when rock stars of the 80s started passing away it was very uncomfortable, but when rock stars of the 90s like Taylor here or the late Dolores O'Riordan of The Cranberries pass away it makes me feel old for real. Like if the Grim Reaper can touch them who were more alive than I'll ever be then it's time to start being concerned with my own mortality. Glad I got to see him play at least once at a show at Fenway Park in Boston a couple years back.
All i keep asking myself is why… Its unfair that life keeps taking these beautiful rare breeds of people at such a young age..   Can’t accept his gone, my heart is truly broken. My love for him and the band will always be there whenever i hear the art they all created..   Rip brother, I’ll see you on the other side one day..
Grohl killed that motherfucker by Giving him keys to the kingdom
😭😭😭😭
It’s hard to believe it. The guy’s a rock legend. I hope he’s in a better place now 😢
Geez, this is absolutely tragic.
Not jumping to conclusions here... But if he did this himself... Jesus Christ. I hope not. Dave does not need this again. He's had 2 best friends in his life... Totally sad.
It doesn’t seems real.
??????
Why are so many musicians dying all of a sudden
So sad to hear this and 50 is way too soon to go, he's my age. I like to know the cause of death what the heck happened to him?
There was an after party jam session when the Rock Hall induction show ended. Belinda Carlisle, Pat, and Dave on drums did a Germs song and some Go-Go's stuff. He was just watching with the rest of us common folk. I knew who he was but I didn't even know his name, I'm embarrassed to say. He was so nice, though. I did the obligatory "congrats' thing and he reached out and shook my hand and said "thank you bro, did you enjoy the show"? Could of just said thanks and ignored me. I'll never forget that. I wish a hard-core Foo fan could have met him instead of me. Genuinely nice fuckin guy. I'm sorry for all you Foo fans loss. Absolutely awful situation.
I never expected to see this. What a shock at the loss of on of the greatest drummers to walk the planet. Rest in peace Taylor. My heart, thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends. Dave and the members of the Foo Fighters my heart goes out to. I can't imagine the loss of your "Partner in Crime". What an intrical part of your sound. He will live on forever in your music.
This is tragic, love that guy. RIP
oh my god no no no noo
I just saw them for the fourth time in Australia. I can’t believe what I’m hearing. Shattering. Rest easy, Taylor.
Most likely drugs.
The first concert I went to was the foo fighters and watching Taylor’s drum solo and take over vocals was one of the funniest amazing moments. This is heart breaking. Rip Taylor Hawkins
So Sorry for The Family and friend and Band.Sorry Dave to have this happen to another friend.💖🙏🙏🙏
What a shock, he seemed in such good health. I just wanna think he's up there jamming with EVH and the rest of the greats.
I am so shocked about the news of Taylor Hawkins my deepest condolences to his family and band members and friends , RIP Taylor.
Wtf Taylor!!!one of the Best drummers Rest  In paradise 😔🤘😤🤙
RIP
Well, this just sucks. They seem to be dropping like flies now..
Cannot believe it’s real 🥺🥺😢
Man this is heart breaking, I can't fathom how much pain the band and the families must be in, he always seemed like the most pure rock soul. I hope he's climbing the stairway to heaven, jamming with Lemmy and Bowie.
R.I.P. dude! /J
Either caused by the vax or by Colombian snow
I never got to see him on a live show.......you think you have time. I'm gonna miss him so much. 🥺
Feel for his wife and three daughters and another friend Dave Groul has lost,  I'm so sad.....
Rest in Peace, Taylor.  ❤
oh well.
R. I. P.   Taylor. 🙏🙏🙏
A great deal of folk are now wondering just how often this kind of sad  'news' is going to be repeated?
Une belle personne qui es partit rejoindre les étoiles c'était un batteur exceptionnel une pensée émue depuis la France 😪🙏 et courage aux groupes et sa famille Foo Figthers ont vous aimes 🙏
damned booster shot.  or is 50 the new 90
Truly devastating.  Prayers for his family, bandmates and friends.
*ring ring...ring ring  William Goldsmith: ...hello? Dave Grohl: heyyyyyy
It seems like Dave lost another good friend,Stay strong Dave,R.I.P Tylor,that's hurt,i have no words😔⭐
I hope hos family can recover
Gutted
This is so heartbreaking, what a great drummer and soul.
💔💔
Shitty shitty news man ... really sucks r.i.p. you are a legend i remember being inspired by your drum style when i saw you for the first time playing with Alanis morisettte on tv. I was probably 13 yrs old.. damn all my heroes are going too soon
This hurts so much. Rip
Absolutely did not expect this news at all, the same day they release their metal album. Such a sad loss
Damn who ever thought him
👤  Ya know...        These things happen to everyone..        But..        It's always a huge shock..        When..it's one the last people on         earth..        That I ever thought it would happen         too.. Way too soon..RIP..
Great drummer with boundless energy, very sad news
This is just terrible! My condolences to the family and every fan including me every where.   R.I.P Mr Hawkins.
I'm shocked I can't believe it. 😰 RIP Taylor
Rip to a legend
That is really, REALLY, *REALLY* shit.
Gone but not forgotten ..RIP ❤
Gone but not forgotten ..RIP ❤
r.i.p
Let me guess... Overdose in a hotel room where he was not seen by anyone and no one can confirm the overdose only what we are told... Always the rock stars.
This is horrible!
This is a very hard day for me and for a lot of Foo Fighters fans, Dave Grohl was one of my first heroes and because of him I discovered Taylor Hawkins who just hit me with his energy, skills and who he was which instantly made me look up to him and he became my hero as well. The Foos will never be the same without him and all our prayers go to them but it goes especially to his family, you will be missed 🤘
F@ck can't believe it. RIP Taylor I'm gutted. 🇦🇺🎸⚡🤘🤘🏿💜💜💜.   My deepest condolences to Dave and family and Taylor's family and friends
That sucks, man. A lot of people don't think 50 is very young to pass away, but it really is. Think about all the stuff that could have been if this talented guy could have been able to stay with us. RIP Taylor... 😢
No.
Holy shit... I'm genuinely devastated. RIP Taylor
One of the all time greats. R.I.P. Taylor. You have gone away too soon but not in our hearts.
Wow this is terrible. I cannot believe this is happening
Wtf damn that's crazy I was just looking at the foo fighters movie yesterday I'ma watch it now
Damn man this one definitely a shock . Saying that feels like an understatement rip Taylor Hawkins. You definitely left a void in the music world.
Get an Autopsy and check for blood clots. I believe they were big influencers for the covid19 vaccine and all got double jabbed and maybe the boosters too, who knows but I'd start there.
Stop cutting onion!!! ;(
It's pretty obvious the vaccine got him.  I know two ladies who died in their sleep post vaccine.
Loved his drumming skills. Omg 😢😳
Just woke up to this absolute shocking upsetting news this hits deep like with Chester don’t wanna believe it
Oh my god Rip buddy What a shocker
So many great people have been dropping like flies lately. Almost like they're being raptured.
Geez that's a shock he the same age as me
:’(
He looked so healthy. Didn't even look fifty. I can't help but wonder what happened. God bless him and his family.
Damn!!!
R.I.P Legends
So absolutely devastating to hear this.. He seemed like the picture of good health too it really shows to not take what time we have for granted.
Drugs.
waking up to this is pain. rip Taylor
Damn
Can we please spell colombia* how its supposed to? Not columbia. Thanks
Dude....I like Taylor  more than Dave.This really sucks
Do you know how physically fit a person needs to be in order to be a drummer of that magnitude!? Rhetorical question. “Sudden death” my ass. So angry and upset for his people.
Cocaine
🤘😔
Absolutely gutted.
RIP just seen them in Cleveland at the Rock Hall
Totally unexpected! What the fuck?! Another one gone.
I can’t believe it!! 😞 RIP
Aww man 🤔😳😭
GUTTED!!! 😩😞💔
Bad news...not what I want to hear out of the Foos. Rest in peace Taylor ✌
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.  Ou my goooood noooooooo. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Genuinely gutted..had the privilege seeing the fooies three times and the man was one he'll of a drummer. He will be sadly missed . Respect and condolences to the whole foo fighters family.
That is sad news.  Kinda shocking, I am not a Foo Fighters fan but I would see him in interviews and he seemed to be on the straight and narrow but from the reports of being found in a car outside a hotel it sounds like it may have been drugs.  And it seems if it is sometimes you never know
I still can’t believe this is real.. not our Taylor Hawkins…
You have gotta be kidding me 😭😭 so sorry everyone 😭
Thank You soo much for the music and the lovely hard hitting drumming that you've made. Couldn't believe it, but you're gone. Rock and Roll forever on Earth and in Heaven! Rest In Power Taylor Hawkins!🙏🏻
Awful, hope it wasn't an overdose of some sort, seems unexpected.
Was he jabbed?
That would be crazy being a drummer for a band fronted by the drummer of one of the biggest rock bands ever.  Anyway, what were they doing touring during a pandemic?  Not cool.
RIP bro🥁
I'm in disbelief. Really?
Was it the vaccine get help
It’s so saaaad😭😭😭 R.i.p🥀
Damn What a devastating loss for the music world. Rest Easy Taylor.
Is colOmbia not colUmbia.
God bless this GREAT GREAT MAN.  He is going to missed BIG TIME.  Such an awesome bad ass drummer.  The talent of Hawkins was unbelievable.  Dave and Taylor are brothers.  Like as close as brothers even without the same blood.  I pray for the entire family.  I’m at at a loss for words.  He was able to play, write, sing, perform with one of rock in rolls greatest bands and he will always be one of my most favorite musical hero’s.
Just heard the news this morning.  Stunned and shocked.  RIP  TAYLOR HAWKINS.   What an incredible musician! Great drummer.  Most amazing,  smiley grin, which I loved.  Condolences to all his loved ones.  Gone too soon.
Another musician another hotel room
😥I've seen him play with My favorite band the Foo Fghters, back til 2019. Taylor blew my mind! He was such a good person, funny. And he was the God on the drums. 🌷⚘️ I just woke with thiese news. It's terrible, it's just wrong. I've followed him and his music ever sins the start.⚘️ Taylor I love YOU! And you And your music will forever live on❤❤❤ My heart goes to Foo Fighters and taylors family❤💔🥀🌹
R.I.P  Taylor Hawkins!!!!       what an amazing life he must have had!!!!!
Obvious natural drummer. RIP
This is so sad I can,t believe this this is awful he was a amazing musician .Miss you 💕😭
Dave has GOT TO BE DESTROYED.. almost never seen them separate..
I'm shocked Taylor was a great drummer has hit both me and my partner. We had just watched Studio 666. R. I. P. Taylor and thoughts with his family and to the band.
Whoops.....o.o Now I know why I need to stay calm....sorry everyone. I burned to hot yesterday.
Every generation has his worldclass drummer, for some it is Ringo Starr, for others it is Keith Moon or Dave Lombardo. And for my generation it was Taylor Hawkins. What a drummer he was. A very big loss in my  and many FF fans eyes . I am sad, we are sad  for the great loss of a fantastic musician who always had a big smile on his face behind his kitt .  R.I.P  Mr Hawkins
I loved this dude.
This is such a shock... such a happy and fun personality Taylor was a well loved part of the Foo Fighters he will be greatly missed What a tragedy to lose him at such an early age
If you want to hang out, you've gotta take her out, cocaine If you want to get down, down on the ground, cocaine
Way too young!!!
Probably all of that fauci vaccine the band insisted everyone take.
He was probably the best drummer alive here in 2022. Heartbreaking. Love this guy. He gave us so so much & will be remembered for the gift he was.
Rest in peace, not a FF fan but the loss of a musician always hurts millions
I don't have the words right now.
Just woke up after a bad nightmare and felt compelled to pick up my phone only to be greeted with this devastating news.  I was in such disbelief at first that I had to double check that today wasn't April 1st and that this wasn't some cruel April fool's joke.  Sadly it seems to be reality.  Aside from being one hell of a drummer, Taylor was such a positive spirit.  This one hurts.  My condolences to his family and friends.
💔 , I lost my husband almost 5 years ago , to your family we know your  hearts will be broken for eternity, and your fans as well, this I know for sure, but we will all celebrate your memory and all of the greatness you bestowed upon us in the light that  you so graciously shined upon us
RIP Taylor, Up in arms from The Beduks
Wow! That’s a kicker! RIP Taylor - you were a superb drummer, and from what I’ve seen of your interviews, a really kind man. God bless.
😭😭😭
Nooooo! RIP man! 💙🤘🏼💥Rock On!
we heard the news  down under 🇦🇺 14.00 hrs (2pm) today.  utter disbelief.! tears a plenty.. ~heartbreaking~ 🥺😥  thank you for the many gigs & the memories.!  i’m still in shock. 😏😒 🇦🇺✌🏻✌🏼✌🏽✌🏾✌🏿🇦🇺
I've always been blown away by Taylors powerful drumming. RIP
He overdosed on heroin before and was in a coma for 2 weeks. Hopefully this was a heart attack or something. Either way that is way too young and he was full of life. R.I.P Taylor ❤️. You can hang with Freddie Mercury now.
Another one no one saw coming  RIP
Thank you Taylor, you'll live on through music and memories. RIP!
Only the good die young. Rest in peace, Taylor.
50 year old men randomly die all the time...NOT...especially when they are in shape of which appears to be the case with Taylor.   Unless it was some bizarre accident, I am going drug overdose.
wtf?! Is this possible? Almost Kurt's look a like.  Is this true?
RIP Taylor 🕊️
One of my personal favourite drummers. Damn. The great gig in the sky just got louder
Impossible to believe he's really dead. At least Bowie's got a drummer now. RIP my blonde puppy 🖤
Is Matt Pinfield narrating?
💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉
Unbelievable. Loved this guy. Such an inspiring musician.
Huge loss, I got to see them at a Big Day Out festival show in Australia around 2002, Foo Fighters and Jane's Addiction stole the show, not sure what the cause of death is, I not what it won't be blamed on though, again.
Rip Taylor Hawkins 🪦
Another to add to the list of 'died suddenly and unexpectedly for unknown reasons' in the past 2 years.
So sad, nothing else to say....
I bet that the frigg'n JAB is to blame!
RIP
RIP BROTHER I PRAY LORD THAT YOU WILL COMFORT AND BLESS HIS FAMILY LOVE YOU TAYLOR
I'm so heartbroken over this news. Taylor seemed such a genuine guy and his friendship with Dave was so touching. I've had the privilege of seeing the band live and am grateful for that. I can't even imagine how the band and Taylor's loved ones are feeling. My son is now the biggest FF fan as I used to play them in the car non stop when he was small. He got to see them 3 years ago. Precious memories. Gone but never ever forgotten. RIP Taylor, you were a truly talented rock God 😪😭💔💔💔Sleep peacefully x
RIP to a legend. Beautiful soul with so much talent ❤
Vaxxed
Such a great loss to the rock community awesome drummer thanks for your great music
R.I.P. Tayler.
Extremely disturbing. Rest in Peace man!!
R.I.P. Taylor Hawkins  😢🕊💔🥀         1972 - 2022   🥁 “The most influential Drummer in entire world and his legacy lives on” 🤟🏻🦅
So sad to hear such a talented man. Will be missed so much. Rest In Peace Taylor.
I just woke up and now I'm hearing this. I am in tears

What! Why? Rip...
Vaccine !

Omg 😥😥😥😥😥 RIP Taylor 🥁🙏🖤
😭💔
Bogotta ? Colombia ? Coincidence ? Doesn't change the outcome , unfortunately . RIP dude
This hurts my heart. So so sad. A great loss to all.  My condolences to his family and his band family. 🙏 💜💔
Rest in peace brother.
☹️
I feel very sad ..he was a such a great drummer and amazing personality...it's crazy how fast we or a loves one can be home so fast....I doubt the foo fighters will be able to play without him...it will be very hard...the band ..Dave must be devastated to lose his best friend...I pray and send blessings to his family...R.I.P Taylor..we will miss you very much.
Don’t be sad cause Taylor Hawkins is at the beach 🏖 be sad sad cause you have no love of God in your hearts I AM Jesus Christ in the flesh
This hurts as much as when we lost Chris Cornell R.I.P
I don't know how to process this... fuck.
What!? No way. I can't believe it. Damn. This is heart breaking 😪
Taylor isn't dead, he's just gone to have drum lessons with Neil Peart. Rudiments In Paradiddles.
Taylor, no way. I'm in disbelief. What on earth happened?! I love you man
Please RIP thanks.
Vax
Gutted 🥹
Rest In Peace Taylor Hawkins 🤘🏼😔
Gutted. Bloody gutted
Horrible news so sorry for him and his family….
What?? they just played Lolapallooza here in Chile! wow r.i.p............ :(((
Sad sad rip Taylor 😭😭😭😭
what the fuck
Nooooooooooo
I feel bad for his family and friends. But try to think of it this way - he led a great life full of adventure and fun and success, and he brought a lot of joy to people he never even met. That's pretty damn cool.
No way! He was too young. RIP dude.
Insane man just can't believe
another blow for dave grohl and pat smear, after kurt cobain's death. Obviously it's gonna be hard for them.
Ironically- The No Jab, No Concert band?
RIP Taylor  GOAT drummer
…ouch. Just..wow. Damn.
We love you, Taylor 😢 ❤
This is a shock, was only watching him and Dave having a laugh on Jonesy's Jukebox, he seemed such a good dude and happy guy and he and Dave Grohl seemed real good friends, Dave must be devastated (he's had too much tragedy in his life), not another day is guaranteed to anyone guys, RIP
Vaccident
This is so epically tragic. So damn young.
Horrible news I just can't believe it,, animal drummer,,,devasted, crying here,, RIP TAYLOR 🤘🤘🤘
Can’t believe this poor man
What in the actual fuck
I can't believe this... I've basically grown with Foo Fighters and he was indescribable, impossible to put into words, both as a drummer and as a cheerful and excited human being.... Why?
I’m looking to see if it is April 1st and this is some kind of a joke…
What????  wtf?? damn! brother.
I'm shocked to hear this sad news .. another great one gone to the big gig in the sky.
Fuckin ouch on my heart for the loss of Taylor Hawkins. Such an amazing musical icon. My condolences to his friends and family you will forever be remembered and never forgotten. R.I.P Taylor give my love to all the rock icons we lost.
Never saw Taylor without a smile, seemed like a happy man, condolences to the Hawkins and Foo Fighter families
Such a bummer to hear.
Wtffffffff
Nooooo, RIP
Gutted. Protect Dave Grohl at all costs.
Damn!
Fuck this.
Rest In Peace Taylor Hawkins Drummer Of Foo Fighters & Alanis Morrisette
Shiiiit no way!!!!!!
Even though, I watched you come and go. How was I to know you'd steal the show?
R. I. P
The vaxxed Foo Fighters were not allowing unvaxxed PureBloods to their concerts. Look at what the Mayor in NY is doing now, he now says Pro athletes and Performers no longer need to be vaxxed, but the regular citizen still has to be. That makes sense, LOL!!! Seems like a lot of young and middle age people are dying of MYSTERIOUS TRAGIC AND UNTIMELY DEATHS recently. It is unraveling. RIP Taylor Hawkins.
Fuck!! RIP.
Good bye hero
There goes my hero 😥 R.I.P ❤
Another vaccine death which will be covered up
Just in shock. Rest In Peace, Taylor. Poor Dave he's done been thru this once already with Kurt. Just so sad.
Just woke up to this sad news. Absolutely gutted. Hate to think whats going through Dave's head atm.  R.I.P  Taylor😥😥😥😥😥
Another amazing musician gone too soon. 😭
An absolute legend has gone. And yet Machine Gun Kelly continues to live.
DONT GET JABBED
I just learned about him watching Atlantis morrissett doc, who knew I been listening to him my whole life. Sad but dude f*cking lived.
Another victim of the vax 💉💉💉
Taylor was the driving Ford for the too fighters we love men
Wow, just wow!
Rip
I hope its not drugs, my gut tells me it is, but damn. Another legend dies, and we have to keep moving on without them. RIP taylor
That's very sad. Thank you for the news.
Bob Saget ....Vaaxine.
Coke?
I would like to offer my deepest condolences to the Foo fighters and the Hawkins family. RIP Taylor it was a pleasure listening to your drumming.
Rest in peace Taylor Hawkins.
This man loved his craft. Can’t believe he is gone, what a sad day.
People can smile and act like it's all great but the man had drug problems he spoke about in the past. It's a struggle on the road doing shows and not be tempted by that stuff. It's an endless rock tale. Their horror 'comedy' in theaters called 'Studio 666' is nothing to be joked about. Satan is having the last laugh.
In these shitty times we now live in and now THIS.......poor Dave, first Kurt, now Taylor, two of his best friends. My condoleances to Taylor's family, friends and of course all the band members. Words can't describe this immense loss of such a nice person and one of the best drummers of the last 30 years. Foo Fighters are one of my favorite bands, I got all their albums......it hurts, Rest in Peace, Taylor😢
R I P Taylor. This has floored me. The Foo's are my band.  The best time in my life was my twenties and the Foo's where the soundtrack to my life. Taylor's drumming was so expressive and like the rest of the band played with a smile on his face Watched Foo's twice in 97 best Two gigs I've been too.
my heart is broken,i still cant believe this ..we lost you.we lost a legend.   rest in peace Taylor. you'll be so missed.
WTF! What happened?
Will be missed hard hitting drummer, RIP brother God bless
I'm Devastated
R.I.P Mr. Taylor  Hawkings....
Damn, to wake up to such news... Rest in peace Taylor, my condolences to his family and fans around the world...
So tragic
The last few years the rock world has been losing a lot of legends. We miss all of them. And now Taylor joined them
More gonna go to other world also by the poisonous Needle
Just woke up and this is the first video to come up on my feed .... this cant be real please say its a bad joke please !
Just in shock, devastated! 💔💔RIP
Nooo too young :(
That was un fortinere, I don't normaly listen to Fo fighters, but my condonelses goes out to every one closest to him.
First Kurt Now Taylor
In tears now... This is not something you wanna wake up to....
WTF
Taylor Hawkins music with Foo Fighters got me through rehab and one of the hardest times of my life I am truly devastated and heart broken rest in peace Taylor Hawkins
What a life he lived ..
AWFUL.  No other words.......
He spent half his life playing with Foo Fighters....😥
Pfizer again...
I had the pleasure of meeting Taylor in 2003 a few times when they were on tour in the UK ... a really nice guy such a shock
Either the jab or O.D. Foo's pushed big pharma's death juice.
Rest in spirit .. thanks for being inspired 😭 cause my Hero song
absolutely gutted
All my love to the band and family. You were a power house.
I;m sure all commenting had a personal relationship with him and had a totally 1 0n 1 with him ! No body gives a crap except for fake up votes !
wow.  what a shock.  RIP.
He was awesome very funny and beautiful in music
Mcjagger outlived this guy? WTF
The band will probably break up after this, can’t see Dave playing with another drummer other then Taylor
Second one dead in a Dave Grohl band ..,.
Wow .. didn’t see this one coming 🙁rip Taylor
Another victim of the Lizer jab 😡
I can’t believe this. How is he gone rest in peace Taylor i’m not a foo fighters fan but this guy inspired me into a general direction of kindness.
So so sad a lovely person with a great sense of humour and a wicked smile god bless you 🙏🏿
Brilliant drummer and, by all accounts, a lovely guy. Rest in peace Taylor, you will be sorely missed!
taylor hawkins RIP another legend taken to early!
😓😓😭😭😢😢😤😢😭😫😫😫😫
rip
I don’t usually get affected by celebrity passings, but this one hurts. My heart broke when I found out the news around 1 am. Such a tragic loss of a tremendous musician. RIP Oliver Taylor Hawkins 💔
What the fuck... 💔
So, so sad.  God bless you forever, Taylor.  You were and are so loved.
RIP Taylor  💔💔🥁🥁
The driving force of positive energy thru the only way he let the world know...Every beat counts!!
Man that sucks, good musicians keep dying and Kirk Hammett is still around, why?!
Damn, RIP Taylor Hawkins! This one hurts….
🙏
wtf
Did he pull a Nick Menza? Oh, no. They left him in the oven too long again. 🤣🤣
Truly sad day for music... 😔
WTH.. 😯😢😥
I'm not sure that this will truly sink in for some time.  RIP Taylor.
It's crazy to think I just watched him in a movie literally couple weeks ago laughing hard in theater with the few people who were there to support but also enjoy a fun movie featuring him and the rest of the Foo Fighters
Wtf 😳
Can't believe it
Damn
Damn
Let nandi bushel join the foo fighters
So sad :( what a loss for sure.
Did he get the COVID mRNA vaccine? It causes blood clotting and heart attacks in healthy people!
We lost a lot of legends this year. RIP Taylor.
R.i.p
ROCK IN PEACE TAYLOR HAWKINS!!. 🙏
So sorry this is very sad news😞🙏🏼
Oh no, not again, RIP Taylor
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!  I JUST HAMD AN INTERVIEW THEY DID IN AUSTRALIA JUST TWO HOURS AGO! SO, SO SAD!!...
😭
Heroin is a hell of a drug
God bless. Thoughts are with both his family and music family love ❤️
I was about to go eat some food when I found out Taylor Hawkins passed away on my phone I was very shocked The news Rest In Peace😭🙏💔
Rock on In paradise Taylor Hawkins.!
Damn, this one's tough to process. One minute I'm watching Foo Fighter vids...the next, this notification appears. Felt so surreal.  I thought to myself, "But, he looks so full of life. It just can't be...and only 50".😥 I wish the reaper would stop backhanding the music industry(and humanity) so often.  I've lost a great deal of artists who were very inspirational to me, many taken in the past 2-3 years. It'd be nice to keep a few around, dammit. Go and sit upon your new throne, Taylor. You and your bandmates are heavy on our minds. We love you.💔❤‍🩹❤
Oh no... RIP
Isn't the orignal Foo Fighters Drummer Dave Grohl. He did their whole first album by himself.
This is so eerie! I just watched Studio 666 and now he's just...gone?!
I’m not a betting man ...but I’d say this is vaccine related! Love and Peace
MRNA 💉effective 👌 👌👌
💔
I wanna cry but i don't know how 😔. Goodbye forever legend 😢
I’m sick.
Part of me just died.
Didn't see that one coming.  What the hell happened?
Come on wtf 🙏 rip...very sad
No way!
R.I.P Taylor, your musical legacy will live forever.
Best modern rock drummer by far!
Wow that suck
RIP Taylor Hawkins! Awesome Drummer!
wait what
Gone far to soon. RIP
I can't fuckin believe he's gone. He's my favorite drummer of all time. I'll miss him so goddamn much. Thank you Taylor for everything!!! We love brother. You'll always look like Edge from WWE to me ! RIP
Nooooooo!!
Rip Taylor. Fark! 2022 u are the worst. Condolences to the band friends and family also his fans
Good for him. This world sucks.
now he's rockin above, rest in peace
foo fighters: get your jab! also foo fighters:
So sad...I remember a few years ago he went thru a huge scare because of a cocaine overdose...
OMG!  This is crazy sad news.  I've just been binge watching FF videos over the last few weeks including the one where Nandi got to play at the Forum with them and Taylor was one of the last people who walked off the stage with her.
OH MAN. This is not what I wanted to see early on a Saturday morning(or any morning to be honest). Mr Hawkins was a real character and real nice guy + the heartbeat of the Foo Fighters.This is such a sad day for his fans. R.I.P Taylor your legacy will go on.
Always with great passion!!!  Left magic not only in the drums but in the compositions and melodies too!! A rhythm and an irreplaceable piece!! R. I. P.!!!
Wonder if it was the vaxx and boosters
Taylor had some of the whitest teeth in all of rock n roll. Between him and Grohl I never noticed teeth like that in all my life
Sincere thoughts and prayers to all involved especially Taylor Hawkins and his immediate family. May God be with all of you in your time of need.
_it must have been that darn vaxine, no rockmusician have ever died young before this_    -  comment section dipshit, 2022
legend
I am literally in shock...I have no words.
OMG🤔😧😧😧😧 DAVE!!!😨!!!! first Curt, now Taylor.
Rest in peace
Satanic sacrifice
What the hell this sucks RIP bro
That really sucks. One of the nicest dudes in rock.
Saw FF in Portland in ‘18 it was a joyous moment in my life. Taylor was as amazing as I remembered hearing on all their albums. RIP Taylor Hawkins your work here is done❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I was in pure disbelief it’s always the ones you least expect to pass on but I’m glad to have been able to listen to his drumming on countless foo fighters records rest easy Taylor 🖤
Heartbroken
Oh my god man bad dream!!! So young so much life to live so much more to give!!! RIP Taylor music I’d silenced once again…
I'm shocked and stunned! But Rock will never die! condolences to family, friends fooies and fans
Ahem, excuse me I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to audible “BOO!” out loud when you read “Nickleback” in the middle of a eulogy of sorts. Please continue…
❤️🙏🏼
Only 50?! Man.... I can't find the words! RIP Brother 🤘🤘
🎼🙏🏿G2💞🌎💞2G🙏🏻🎼
Wow, RIP Taylor Hawkins! An amazing drummer! "When you're dead, you're dead. But you're not quite so dead if you contribute something." Your inspiration will live on!
Neil peart, Joey joradison, Taylor Hawkins gone too soon
This sucks, but I think I'll remain one of those anti-vax morons and be alive...
I hate to ask THAT question.
What? Wtf!?!? What the actual fuck!?!?
It is too bad but, one of the best drummers ever? Let us not get carried away now.
Wow ! That's crazy ! Parish from the vaccine !?
ANOTHER VACCINE VICTIM FOR SURE.
I need to know how he passed. Bro...
Whenever  we hear thunder, from now on we'll know Taylor has turned the sky into a giant kit. R.I.P.
I was just explaining he's my favorite drummer. Whatever's been going on with celebrity deaths- of course it's kept quiet and respected. I just know Jesus is calling in the ultimate rock show for the wedding of the lamb, and i KNOW this-  We will of course forever mourn sweetly and dearly and pray for his family who mournfully survive him. Yes, one heavenly of a concert is being prepared for the wedding feast.....
NOOOO I’m completely in shock… 😥💔 RIP Taylor
Fuck man what is going on?! We lost Neil in 2020, Charlie in 2021, and now Hawkins? Why are drummers biting the dust?. RIP Taylor, I will always have pride knowing that I have your name as a middle name
i'm speechless.. i can't believe!!! 😢😢😭😭
This is so lame… what a talent this hurts me like when George Harrison died
wow just saw where The Warning was opening for them ....so crazy and untimely
South America has some of the most ferocious Hard Rock Fans there are. have got to be in serious Mourning.
Was probably on drugs
RIP
An iconic rock legend that will leave behind a beautiful legacy RIP Taylor
Im lost for words..., RIP Taylor
knees buckled.
Rest well Taylor. 1972-2022.💔
Daves brother from another mother. So sad. My condolences to his family and band and friends.
Rock In Peace Taylor Hawkins🤘🏻
Damn.  Wtf?  I'm tired of losing heros
i was shocked to see the title that he passed away and was thinking man that guy is young😮‍💨
Well they were vax pushers so I don't give a f*ck.
Saddened me so much. I drummed in my youth and he was one of those guys I could tell was really good. I was never one to look up to Neil Peart or Mike Portnoy. My idols were punk and alternative rockers like Marky Ramone and Dave Grohl. I could tell Taylor was good, though. You'd have to be to drum in Dave Grohl's band. Plus, he had charisma to match. This is a real shame. Anyone else think rock is slowly fading into history?
Wow.? Only words.
This totally breaks my heart. What an incredible drummer, what an incredible person. My prayers and condolences to his family.
Rip Taylor 🍻
Omg, the coolest one in the band. This is terrible! RIP Taylor.
Only thing that was better than the music  was watching interviews with Dave and Taylor goofing around.....always had that one of a kind grin on his face. Gunna miss that.... I wish the Foo's,friends and family nothing but love.
Holy Shit, RIP dude.
What a punch in the gut'
Met Taylor before a Chevy Metal show. He was the nicest guy. GODBLESS TAYLOR AND HIS FAMILY.
Let me take a Wild Guess💉☣️🤔 But I wouldn't be Surprised if some Dope is Planted to Cover up for the Poison Shot! SOO Many Previously Healthy People are Dropping Dead or getting Myocarditis - Especially many  Young Heathly Sportsmen & Women are here One Day, Gone the Next! The MSM is Covering it Up! This is Mass Murder!! This is No Accident! Arrest Gates! Arrest Fauchi! & All the Big Pharma CEO's - Enough is Enough!
Another awesome musician/drummer lost. Rest in Peace Taylor and my condolences to all his friends and family,he had a larger than life personality.
R.I.P. ❤😢
Prolly OD
Damn that hurts  Poor Dave has lost two good friends and bandmates now.
😔
Oh nooo
This one hurts like Chris Cornell did. 😞
I just can't believe this, 50 years old, Man that is way to young, I'm absolutely stunned by this. did he have a medical condition? Sickness? Just completely unbelievable. First Neal and now Taylor. God Bless you my Brother, You were an absolutely Incredible Drummer, Singer and all around Musician and even more an amazing Person. You will never be Forgotten and will live forever in the music you played and the millions of Fans you have. My Heartfelt Prayers go out to your Family and to your band Brothers...
I just can't process this yet.
Saw this when it was first reported. Love Foo Fighters, saw him interviewed along side of Dave and thought, what a cool guy. Feel horrible for his family and the band. RIP Taylor.
He killed me with hear when he made his sound on “My Hero” by the Foo Fighters “there goes my hero, watch him as he goes”
i wonder  if he was vaccinated ?
Absolutely gutted by this. RIP Taylor. You will be sorely missed.
So very sad to hear RIP Taylor Hawkins
So sad
I’ve literally never been more shocked. I had tickets to see them in July.
A lot of middle aged people just dropping dead over the last year .......... hmmmm, Gee I wonder why ?
This makes me absolutely ill.
Life is truly full of surprises. You just think that yourself, your friends, your family, and the people you admire are just gonna live forever... RIP
Wow seriously cant believe it ... RIP Taylor you will never be forgotten
How he died
A symbol of 90s rock. He had so much life within him and always brought joy to his fans. We've lost so many heroes these last couple years...
❤🤘
Gone way too soon, way too young. Damn, RIP dude.
Damn ......RIP Taylor 🥁
R.I.P
vaccination works?
Jesus what a way to start your day. Honestly he played drums like his life depended on it, Hands down he's in my top rock drummers of all time.
Jeez, was not expecting this! RIP
Wait, whyyy???? I was watching a Stevie T video and I just stumbled across this
No ONE gets out of this alive, at 50 or 82...it doesn't matter; live your life people.
Is COLOMBIA not COLUMBIA!!!
What a shock - you'll be missed my man. It goes without saying you're a master musician but I'll miss your cool, your sense of humour and your modesty the most. My heart goes out to your family, friends and fans. Rock In Peace Taylor
we have been losing a lot of drummers recently i dont listen to foo fighters very often but i can imagine how heartbreaking this would be for the band RIP Taylor Hawkins
My hearts pounding so hard. What happened? 50, the new 27. Oh man this sucks. I’m so sorry for our loss. 🌹❤️
Hail and farewell.
No! No! No! I’m devastated! This is heart and soul crushing. Why??!!! OMG! My baby💔🥺😭I’ve been with Taylor since Alanna. This is terrible. My poor Foos and Foo fans all around the world, I’m grieving with you.
Got back from seeing Uncle Acid And The Deadbeats from the Depot in downtown SLC and my dad showed me the news coverage on the phone
Oh my gosh! Ugh! It hurts 💔😢.  Too many good ones just gone. RIP. Mark Lanegan as well. Unbelievable. Makes me feel a lil more alone 😔😪😕
What was the ""cause"" of death? Does anyone know? It's not like Taylor had a drug or alcohol problem, far from it. To me, this hurts just as bad as when Pink Floyd lost Rick Wright. A vital element of the Foo Fighters has been lost so I wonder if Dave will go back to drumming duties and do a journey by getting a Grohl/Hawkins soundalike.
Omg what happened 😳  RIP Taylor ⚘
RIP, what a kind human being he was.
RIP Taylor. God bless you…
😣😣😣😣😣♥️♥️🙏
R.I.P Taylor.  I never got to see you live but every performance I saw of you on TV right back to Alanis it was clear that you put your all into every song. Thanks for the music though gout the years.
Who gives a fiddlers fuck what Jess margera says.
Im not feeling well 😭🥺😭🥺😭🥺
RIP TAYLOR. You will be missed.
Taylor Hawkins……RIP…..😢
So Sad, I dont know what to say. Im an old guitar player trying to learn drums because of him. My heart goes out to the family
What did he die from?
Sad great drummer
RIP..taylor hawkins
Tragic RIP 😥 TAYLOR HAWKINS
Saw this headline thumbnail and was initially angry that someone is posting sensationalist fake news. But now it's starting to sink in, so hard to believe. Still looked and performed like a very young man full of energy and mojo. Sad Sad Sad... RIP Taylor and condolences to family and friends.
Damn.  Just horrible.
Rip 😞
Funny Never Liked the Guy
Fuck that!!!!!!

The devil went down to south america to collect
Fuck I want to go give his best friend Dave Grohl a hug. He must be devastated.
What how - in utter shock! RIP man, so many years ahead, dog gamnit, too friggin early.
So sad to hear this news. Terrible that so many Gen X rockers are dying so early .. he will never be forgotten leaving a lasting impact for a generations to come. Condolences to his family.
Oh no! So sad. They were going to play at the Grammys this year.
Very very sad. Good dude. Rest easy sir
Bruhhhh i just watched studio 666😭😭
Dave Ghrohl is a black cloud, Kurt, Not Taylor? 🤔
My wife’s best friend is a relative of his I’ll have to send her this it was a nice tribute
Holy shit!! Such sad fkn news!! One of the best drummers in the game!! RIP Taylor Hawkins!!
i don’t listen to a lot of foo fighters but i was shocked to read this. it sucks man it was so unexpected he was a great drummer RIP Taylor

F*cking Jab!

Damn...R.I.P.
How?
DEVASTATED 😔 ❤️
Taylor has now reached immortality.
This broke me inside.
RIP Taylor, one of my biggest inspirations in drums
This is so sad. God bless him.
so sad to hear this. Taylor just seemed like a real genuine human being. He was always fun to watch on drums. Gone way too soon. What a fun spirit he was in the band!
Dam he is just a couple of years older than me. Rest in peace
Wow
My god I can’t believe it
Wow surprising and sad
WTF? WHAT? Is this really real?
Wtf😮 i,ve just saw the foo fighters movie a few days ago, this is so depressing, rip taylor
I’m at work hearing this for the first time.  Rest In Peace Taylor.
I'm in Colombia now. Wanting to see them😭
Dave grohl pushed the vaxx.. Blood on your hands Dave
Wait, how did this happen?! He was healthy, not exactly super old, and as far as I'm concerned he stopped consuming drugs years ago... He immediately left an impact on my life the day I went to a Foo Fighters concert, his energy and charisma were remarkable in every aspect, I can't believe so many legends are leaving us... RIP🖤
Totally in shock. RIP
Another Rock Icon gone too soon. Such an energetic performer and musician. R.I.P. Taylor Hawkins.
Nobody put as much energy into the kit as he did. His passing is a great loss for the earth.
VACCINATED ???
E#  in the chat to pay respects
DAMMIT. THIS SUCKS. WHY IS IT ALWAYS THE GOOD ONES? FOREVER REST IN PEACE, DUDE. YOU WILL BE SOLELY MISSED. AND NEVER FORGOTTEN.

Such a cool cat! A force of nature...I wonder if the clot shot has taken another good man down?
What a great loss to the music world. Amazing drummer. RIP
What a shit 18th birthday present... Rest in peace to a man that I modeled both my early drumming and my life after. I didn't think I could cry about someone I've never met but here I am.
Another Covid vaccine victim! Many more to come!
How is this possible? :(R.i.p
Damn.... :(
Rip true Rock star gone too soon 😪😪😪
Why couldn't it have been Putin?  Tragic loss.
I can’t believe it. So many are stunned and sad, and my heart goes out to his family and the band.  Another gut wrenching professional and personal loss for Dave, as well.
Que pena coño, que gran músico. Mis condolencias a familia y a amigos.
Stop. Dying. Fuck. Sake.
Another safe and effective death?
This can’t be real
His poor family, especially his kids....my condolences to his loved ones.
Daaamn we as fans have lost far too many great artists in far too short of time... RIP Taylor

This is so unbelievable, the heartbreak that follows this band and Dave is so unimaginable that I just can't wrap my mind around it. All of me goes out to this band because all of this band has gone out to me!
Rip.  Dimmer here now.
R.I.P Taylor Hawkins.💐 My family and I feel so bless to have gotten the chance to see you play your music here in NJ. God Speed.
I'm so devastated. Sending thoughts and prayers to his family and The Foo Fighters 🙏💔

I am very shocked to a great drummer who played in the greatest band in the world 🌎. My condolences to Taylor Hawkins and The Foo Fighters.
I just woke up to this news. The news was truly shocking. My thoughts go out to his family and bandmates. RIP Taylor 😪😪😪
Rip to my favorite queen loving drummer . Condolences to all family . Sorry dave I know your hurting .
Another legend lost too soon…fly high Taylor 🕊
Drugs (and bakzines) are bad, mmkay?
Why are drummers leaving so soon........rip legend
At age 50 yikes that's young!!
Man that hurts so much. The guy was a legend, the heartbeat of the Foo’s.
Devastating news.  Helped me get through so many of lifes obstacles. Musically the best drummer in the business. Named my dog after you. My daughter who's 14 thinks your the coolest, and best looking man alive.... its my 42 birthday today and I'll say a prayer every year.  Rest easy man. 💔
Omy good whaaaat
I feel like I was punched in the gut :/
So fuckin sad man...Cool cat..fuck!!😖🙏🥁
Wtf!! Oh my goodness. Feel like puking

Wonder what he died from ? Not a fan but damn crazy
Condolences to the Family R.I.P Taylor Hawkins 🌷🌷🌷
This is so sad. He had so much personally and talent. So sad for his family and friends.
He got vax

What happened to him? 😢Rip TH 💔 prayers to his family and friends 🙏🏻
R.I.P Taylor.🙏🙏
He had a beautiful smile.
Absolute gut punch. Such a cool and talented dude. RIP T.H.
This one hits hard.
Shocking news. So gutted. Feels so unreal. Rest in power and my deepest condolences to Taylor's family and bandmates.
Oh my God 😢
Remember that one time Dave required everyone in his band get jabbed?
I am also really heartbroken that he has passed because I really enjoyed Taylor’s drumming and I was going to see them play this December
wtf
Oh wow this is not good man
RIP Taylor.  Incredibly sad.  A young guy seemingly in perfect health.   Hopefully people will wake the FUCK up and stop this vaxxx madness.  How many stars, athletes and otherwise healthy people do we have to hear about dying before we put an end to this madness.
At 1:07 it shows that they thought it was 'DECOMPENSATION' ..Well, I looked that up.. It's a HEART ISSUE.. so now, I ask.. WAS TAYLOR HAWKINS VACCINATED ?? This is getting WAY beyond any scope for anyone to simply  DISMISS.💯
Damn!!!!!!!  RIP
So sad. Just remembering him playing a women in some of the foo fighters music videos. He was a funny guy and an awesome drummer.
RIP Taylor Hawkins. he will live on in our hearts
😲gasssp what the fuck!?
One of the best musicians in one of the greatest bands. Rest In Peace Taylor Hawkins. 🤘🏻🌹
Here because of you Taylor, thank you bro. RIP
I can't believe the news :(
Can't believe he's gone! So sad. R.I.P. Taylor. 😭
I'm still crying over this ... I was lucky enough to see foo fighters live a few years ago in Chicago.. and watched his side band Chevy Metal at the xgames a couple years ago front row... he talked with me after the show for a few minutes and.... FUCK why did this have to happen? Rest in Peace my friend.❤  You'll live with us through your music foreverlong 🙏🙏🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
The hawk has flown too soon!😭one of my fav and respected legendary drummers of all time who influenced me bigtime. Absolutely devastating. My heart and prayers go out to Taylors whanau and his Foos whanau. They will be absolutely in shock and heartbroken...RIP rokin it up in heaven you freaking rok legend you!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Absolutely devastated and heartbroken to hear this horrific news…. I saw him when he played with Alanis in 1996 with her Jagged Little Pill tour and saw him with Foo Fighters at Fenway Park in Summer of 2015… one of the best concerts in my 46 years on this earth…. 😘🌟😢🙏❤️ RIP Taylor
Damn wtf……
What a shame. Awesome drummer from an awesome band.   The vaccine conspiracy theories will start in 3, 2, 1,……
I am absolutely heartbroken, rest in peace
WTF is this a joke. Love to the family and his friends
WTF happened??
It's incredible and I still can't believe that he's gone, last Friday I saw him at the lollapalooza concert in Chile, I'm devastated, gone but never forgotten Taylor Hawkins.
For those asking about the cause ... please be patient and respectful for his family. Please. Rest in Peace Taylor
Nooooo
How   sad,  unbelievable....💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Dave is going through it again. Damn. Sorry to everyone and Taylor’s family for your loss.
Whoa, ouch, he was an absolute beast, RIP 🤘🏻
It's Colombia not Columbia
God Bless.
Omg.....  Man. That's heartbreaking.... 😭RIP Taylor you will be missed.
Its Colombia not columbia
From all the articles I've read so far, I guess he passed literally just s couple hours before they were supposed to play. He will definitely be missed! R.I.P TAYLOR

This is devastating. I hope it wasn’t drugs but it seems like it was, I can’t believe he’s gone.
Omg r.i.p
THIS HURTS RIP TAYLOR HAWKINS!!!
So sudden so sad...pray for his family pray for his band mates pray for his friends and the fans who loved his seemingly boundless energy... hoping Freddie is greeting you up in Rock and Roll Heaven and thanking you for your love 💕
The first time I saw him in like 97 I knew he would do that to Dave just like Kurt. Rip Dirt Kobain
Another one gone to soon rip.
Ahh man, this is heartbreaking. Unreal to hear this sad news. The guy had so much energy and positivity. Damn
So devastated completely out off nowhere r.i.p Taylor
This one is really hard, the Foo Fighters have been my favorite band for years.
he lived an incredible life and died while touring, lets celebrate this great man!!
That is mad and very sad to hear! At least we can say he lived it to the max, rock on up there Taylor 🤘.
Taylor will be so missed my thoughts and preayers are with his family and Foo Fighters

Looks like the jab got another one. RIP Taylor Hawkins.
Christ, how much more can we take (us Gen X’ers)?
Sad to hear but he had an incredible life and lived as a rich and famous rock star and toured all over the world and had a nice family. A life well lived.
I have no words......RIP Taylor 🥁

Tragedy one of the best drummer on this earth

WOW sad
So sad… why do we always lose the greatest souls? 😢 R.I.P. Taylor Hawkins 💙
Hot fuckin' damn. First Meat Loaf, then Mark Lanegan, now this. Sending thoughts to your loved ones dudo, I just hope it's not something dark. 😔
Oh no. ☹️😔 Thats incredibly sad.
I literally just got into foo fighter a month ago, fuck man
let me guess he had all his jabs? never a good thing to see rock legends die but with the Foo fighters right wing enter policies some would say this was divine intervention
RIP Taylor Hawkins 😔 he will truly be missed, this is so sad! My heart goes out to everyone close to him, Dave and band mates must be devastated, I just watched Studio 666 last night.
Rip
Shocking news. So sad. Rock on Taylor! You will be missed
🥁🎶💔
No!  No, no, no!
This is so sad. Taylor was absolutely awesome and such a nice guy. I’ve met he a few times and he was so nice.
GODSPEED SIR
OMG.  So horrible.   He was a great drummer and seemed so funny and kind. RIP and condolences to the Fighters and their extended family.
Another talented drummer gone...R.I.P and  deepest condolences to his family and the band.  ❤

Oh my God. OH my God. OH my God. Rest in peace. What the fuck. OH my God. Oh my god.
rip
Fuck man.... So goddamn tragic. 💔💔💔
Not only was he my favorite, but he was from my neck of the woods. Hes always the guy i look at when i start to think ill never be able to do anything being where im at. I cant believe this. I just cant
Dammit.
Funny story I was like 11 yrs old on the set of breakout at a shut down drive in theater. I saw taylor walking up to craft services in a white fur coat with a bunch of chick's , I didn't know music then and I asked are you in the band? He got offended and said he was the band and later had me thrown off the set for it. I sat for hours in my step dad's car and later got yelled at by my step dad for asking him. Guess I almost got him fired for it.
We have to get used to rock heroes dying at this point. We've already lost so many.
God give peace to his friends and family.
So sorry. RIP.
Heart Attack, RIP  Taylor Hawkins
See you on the other side
I am shook!!!
RIP Taylor, you will be missed but will live on through your amazing drumming😢
I’m not even really a fan of Foo Fighters music but they’re all great and standup guys. Really sad news and a heavy loss. R.I.P Taylor 🙏
That sucks, he was A great drummer
So sad man. I just woke up from a long ass nap after work and couldn’t believe it when I looked at my phone. RIP Taylor ❤️
Rip Taylor you will be missed by many
I guess Dave Grohl will have to get another gay lover now.  Sad.
RIP my friend.
So sad. Hearts out to his family. He was a gift to music and love. Sorry to all close to him.
DRUG OVERDOSE.
This is the most f**ked up news that I ever heard of 2022 so far. R.I.P. Taylor Hawkins (1972-2020)😟😟😢😢😢😭😭😭😭. I can't sleep now because I'm shock from the news. I'm definitely going to sent prayers to Foo Fighters, to all of his friends, and to his family.
No way
I always said... Dave and Taylor played every show as if the fate of the world depended on it. As if, if they didn't rock hard enough, aliens would destroy the planet. He put everything he had into every show and every song. I am devasted by this news.
I cant believe this.... It just doesnz seem real. I was just listening to his new project with dave navarro just a couple of days ago. My ALL TIME favorite drummer. His style was always my favorite. I hate this so much
Isn’t Atlantis Morissette his wife? Can’t she just bring him back?
Covid vaccine 💉 got him ? Sad 😔

This is a major loss.. I’m still trying to wrap my head around this .. RIP Taylor Hawkins . One of the best to ever pick up a pair of drum sticks. He’s like John Bonham .. can’t be replaced.
So young. What a great life. Has fame, talent, wealth  and still.true to his rock roots. Not pretentious and flamboyant like so  many. Just a really cool down to earth guy.  RIP!
Another one of my favorite drummers gone💔💔💔

This channel spelled Colombia "Columbia" lmaoo. Effin gringos.  RIP Taylor ♥️🙏
Our thoughts are with his family and friends... Thanks for the memories Taylor....
This hurts me inside, The Foo Fighters have helped me through so many hard times in my life. Taylor Hawkins inspired me to start drumming, and now i play small shows with my band, this is a kick in the gut to anyone he has touched mentally. Condolences, from every single one of his fans. Love You Taylor.
Saw them play here in Fresno back in December, amazing show, Taylor was excellent. This sucks!
This year keeps getting worse 😭😭 first Mark Lanegan passed away and now Taylor Hawkins 😭😭
Absolutely Devastated RIP Taylor
I could hear in your voice you had tough time reporting this :(  R.I.P. Taylor

Thats sad. But, u really need to stop touring now. The whole earth is a mess right now.  Js
Wow, this is insane. We're finally going to have them come back to NZ this year with the borders just opening back up and now this happens. Rest in peace ❤️
Sure are alot of sudden deaths lately.
That’s too sad. He looked like he was totally in shape too. You just never know.
I think God has taken enough drummers from us the last couple of years..
Dang I’m in shock Taylor Hawkins was a great  drummer it’s so sad to see him go may he rest in piece
What?!?
One has to wonder if a certain Government injectable played a role in his demise; perhaps the same Government injectable that fans were required to have received prior to being admitted to certain FF shows not so along ago.
R.I.P Taylor Hawkins
Saw them many years ago in Pensacola FL, dude! This one hurts bad! Godspeed Taylor! Gone too soon!
I'm in utter shock. RIP to a legend, and may his friends, family, bandmates find some kind of peace and comfort in this devastating time.
Can't believe this😥
Still in shock. My dream was to meet Dave and Taylor.  Taylor is singing "Somebody to Love" with Freddy Mercury right now.
Damn, wtf man?!?!
RIP. 😢
So very sad ... R.I.P. Taylor
Didn’t want to hit the like button.😪 God please bless his family, friends, and the foo fighters brothers!🙏🏼💐💙
So sad, wish I could have seen him play..🙁☹😢 only 50 years...still so young.
Much love to y'all btw if anyone needs it, things have been rough all around so if anyone needs an "Internet Hug" 🤗
He took the jab..
RIP Taylor Hawkins🤘🤘
Taylor is currently rocking out in Heaven. We all love you, Taylor. Rest easy.
Very 😢 Sad... Extremely BRUTAL loss in the rock/metal world...Too Many Legends leaving us in music as of late.🖤🤘🏻
Wow. He was a great drummer and singer too. All my best to the FF boys, and to his family. Sleep with angels, and never know pain again brother. Rock out with Dime and Vin, EVH, Randy Rhodes and all the other legends on the other side.
My heart literally shattered reading this truly devastating news. Rest in peace Taylor Hawkins
Wtf? For real?!
I recently go into foo fighters like maybe 4 months ago. I can't believe this happened. Rest easy Taylor.
That is terrible.... Everyone in Food Fighters is of great heart... And Taylors personality even while drumming was definitely not unnoticiable Rest in Peace Taylor....and live again🤘🙏
This really surprised me, holy shit. RIP to one of the greats.
There are no words! 50 is no age at all and we have lost one of the best drummers to ever grace Rock and music in general. RIP Taylor, you are jamming in the world beyond with the other greats now.
I was at the Sevendust concert and they announced it. Everyone went silent.  Sevendust dedicated the rest of the concert to the Foo Fighters drummer.
God, please bring Taylor back to us and take MGK instead..
Dave Grohl is bad juju
Eahh rayo qué fuerte estoy tan triste
We lost another rock legend, R.I.P Taylor Hawkins, gone but never forgotten💕🤘🏼all prays and love to his family and friends
RIP Taylor Hawkins.
I watched David on Hot Ones recently and after seeing it got me to listening to them again and checking out songs I've been missing out in life, and cant express how much we will miss out of his talent and coolness. R.I.P.
Should have never got the shot
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Omg what a tragedy
My week has been SUCH a shit show, this news came to me right when I  was settling in to relax after the work week.....
What the hell?
Devastating
Temptations got the best of him down in Columbia .... 😞

WTAF? Condolences to the Fooey's & Taylor's family. Shocked.
I can't believe it. I always loved Taylor. The interviews with him and Dave (especially the scooter DUI) were  funny. RIP to one he'll of a drummer
RIP Taylor Hawkins he will be missed
No!!!!!!
The price of fame.
This is crazy news. Tragic shit.    ...  a reminder to LIVE LIFE FULL EVERYDAY.   No days are throw aways. I know I myself, get caught up in the grind and routine of life and you take for granted that there's lots of time,  but there isn't. get off the couch
Now this hit me like no other before. This is crazy im so shocked
This was so unexpected. He pasted so young. I was in such disbelief this is shocking.
Oh maan...not him...he was my 3rd favorite drummer even after he & the band made an appearance on robot chicken. I fell in love with "Learn To Fly" & "The Pretender" Fly into his kingdom with open arms & loving grace, you guys were my saving grace from violence & fueled my interest in rock n roll
Damn, I can't believe it, I love Foo Fighters. 💔
Overdose is what I have heard Damn shame Great 🥁
🎶 One of these days the ground will drop out from beneath your feet One of these days your heart will stop and play its final beat One of these days the clocks will stop and time won't mean a thing One of these days their bombs will drop and silence everything🎶  I’ve not been in such a “this isn’t real, this isn’t real situation” in some time. Life is short. You never know when you’re gonna go. May he Rest In Peace. Still one of those deaths you can’t help feel like smashing a 2x4 on your head. Because pinching yourself is too tame to help wake up from this.
It won’t stop.  Hero after hero.
And it's my 40th birthday today. 😢
It’s just crazy he still had a lot of life in him, RIP Taylor 🙏
Omg ! I can’t believe this !!!
dave must be devastated, just shocking, RIP
One of the greatest artists of all time. Music will never be the same without you bro. 💔 RIP Taylor Hawkins
Absolute disbelief. Rest In Peace.
Wait! What the hell?! I was just watching their Carpool Karaoke vid on James Corden. Then this showed up. Damn rest easy buddy! Say hi to all the great rock legends in heaven! Fly high 🕊️💕🥁
I'm not a huge FF fan but you can't deny their place in rock music and Taylor was a much loved member. Truly awful news. RIP.
Wow. I don’t even have words. I’ve spent my childhood listening to them, this is truly sad. RIP Taylor rest easy. Poor Dave first curt and now Taylor 😭😭

Damn have to say never really listened to them, but always respected this band, hope they come through this together and remember the good times R.I.P
this is a man who inspired so many people. if the foo fighters continue to write music and tour (which i doubt will happen) they’ll never be the same. so so devastating.
I feel bad for all of them, especially Dave. I wonder if they'll continue or call it quits? Gone way too soon!
Oh my god 😭😭
Please no…… man this is killing me. What the fuck dude. I can’t believe this….
Damn! Kurt, Layne, Mike ,Kristin now Taylor…
Rip. This hurts my heart. I'm watching studio 666 and this pops up! 😭
