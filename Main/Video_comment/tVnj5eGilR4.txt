Here after the Cardinals beat the cowboys again 😂
1:08
I love you the Cowboys
Cardinals own the cowboys...
Dobbs is much better qb than dak
11:04 why coach gannon kinda built tho
Bro when Joshua Dobbs  won that game I knew he was gonna be in my top 5 favorite QBs
4:48
Instead of America's team. America's Laughing Stock.😂😂
Don’t you worry, we’ll never change ,what about dem cowboys??!!!
9:14 very sexy throw
This wasn’t a fluke….it was an omen
We all know who won Arizona cardinals
Cowboys county let's cry
Coboys country let's cry
Prescott pick ends the cowboys again it always happens
Gotta admit the Josh Dobbs is a good quarterback while Dak Prescott being overrated
You know the cardinals beating the cowboys and the eagles but losing to the giants and commanders that’s just funny 😆
Love watching cowboys lose 😂😂😂
Bro sliped mid game 💀
We still looking for Micah Parsons end of season podcast but he MIA😂 but Mrod here to fill in! I told the boyz fans a loss  was going to expose them was coming and a team that finished below 500 beat them lol and it was an early that put a dent on this wannabe all time defense! Cheers Dallas suckers😂😂
All the eagles fans was laughing at Dallas only to lose to the Cardinals at home with the division on the line
Wow cowboys are bad
My Cowboys played well enough to win this game despite our bad coverage in the secondary and also not stopping the run.  Also with the offense moving the ball and getting in the red zone plenty of times only to settle for a fg if that. We shot ourselves in the foot this game and the missed opportunities only made us better since
I love visiting these comments down in the season.. HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS!!!!!
Me as a cardinals fan I am so proud of my cards but the cowboys did put up a good fight❤
We were w/o our 3 starting OL & Trevon Diggs , just a hiccup game . We bounce back .
The Cowboys seemed to have lost their sharpness altogether.
....any other Vikings fans in here familiarizing themselves with Dobbs's game ahead of the Vikings/Saints game? I don't want to get my hopes & expectations up, but from what I'm seeing him do with the Cardinals offense, against a pretty good Cowboys team, I see no reason why he can't perform at least this well in Minnesota. 🤞🤞🤞

I don’t like watching the cowboys play, nor Arizona, but any game with Joe Davis as a commentator just becomes like the best game of the day. Lol
so you won your only game against the Cowboys, so what? and the Texas Rangers beat your Arizona Diamondbacks at home in the world series in 5 games.  so shut up! don't mess with Texas!
Let's see what KOC can do with this kid
Here after we traded for Dobbs.
Vikings fan here looking at Josh highlights.
Here to check out Dobbs after he became a Viking!
Skol
Love it, can't wait to see him on the Vikings, 1st play and he can run like that?  yessss
Vikes fan looking at Dobbs after Trade 🤔 should be interesting to see What he does here in MN
SKOL😈😈😈
Good to see that the cardinals beat the 9ers rivals
I feel like the cardinals are still 2021 but kliff ruined everything I think the cardinals just wanted to win this game and used their real playbook because they thought 1 win vs the cowboys does sound nice 😂 I’m not a cards fan
National Football League
rondale moore to RB
How’s the Niners d$&k taste
Battle of the 2 teams we beat 😂
Who here for a analytic data for there parlay tn 😂😂😂
Why did I think the score was 36-137 for a second when they showed yards 💀💀💀
Man there was ALOT of cool catches.. Show some replays man….!!!!! God
Dobbs is the goat
someone will call it an excuse but how are there zero mentions of the cowboys missing 3 starting offensive lineman and our starting corner, 3 offensive lineman including the center. that’s just how desperate the haters are to see the cowboys lose lol. don’t matter if it’s in 5, 10, or 20 years but when the cowboys win again the world is gonna be miserable 😂
Cowboys offense flop so hard in that game
I can’t believe we gave up over 200 rushing yards
Cowboys I really feel they need a qb dak is just mid
Those saying oh we gonna relie dak nope it’s our defense that has saved us  all game long against patorits
Dak prescott is terrible tell me how many touchdowns he did this game recently no one it’s the defense not the offense
Awesome  I'm glad u let m3 watch the game think you
cowboys will win by 14 today
Yeee haaaa!!
Dak is a horrible quarterback.
NY came back and then you have the Cowboys 😂
That should of been holding on the defense against lamb on 8:11
Dak throwing into triple coverage???
I don’t think Arizona is as bad a team as people have been saying. They’ve got some good players and they could easily be at least 2-1 had they not blown that game against the Giants.
My two favorite teem, saludos desde el salvador
A bunch of cowgirls fans were mad that day 😂
The referees must’ve been cardinals fans. This was a good loss for the cowboys. Cardinals ain’t SHT!
Im a Giants Fan.  I Appreciate the Way that Arizona Plays Defense   I was Told that The Cardinals are Trying to " TanK "  do the Players Know That
lol how did you lose to the cardinals
Any given sunday baby! 😂
New to the game. Can anyone help explain why Falcon chose to play 2-pt attempts for the first two touchdowns?
That is just sad cowboys 😂
Bring CD Lamb to the Texans
Cardinals look tough. The 49ers had better not get overconfident on Sunday.
Cowboys are God's team
If this isn't racist I don't know what is?,😊🤔
As Tennessee fan glad to see my boy Dobbs playing well.
Dobbs > Dak
I’m kinda new to watching football weekly. I’m from Texas I’m a cowboy fan because I’m from Texas. (I don’t understand ppl going for a team that they don’t even live in the same state as the team). Why do ppl hate the cowboys so much?
Great game fellas go azcardinals 🐍🐐☀️
I was rooting for the underdog but unfortunately the Cardinals won today
James Connor a big reason Cards could get the dub
Lets go cardinals
Dak is just not an elite QB. He falls somewhere between 12th to 15th but he is certainly over paid.
Joshua Dobbs has made a lot of money this year if I was a team he would be the number-one backup quarterback to pick up in free agency or bridge quarterback
Refs rig and control games
Dem girlz still ain’t ready!
From packers nation enjoyed the game
Hollywood is in Hollyhood mode.
Nothing like a Dallas cowboys loss as a Dallas cowboys fan. Nothing like it!!
Dobbs looking better than Kyler hmm QB compation or no you judge
What’s Dallas doing? It ain’t the playoffs yet! 😂
Ngl if I was cardinals give up on that diva qb kyler Murray. They will be better off in the long run trust me. Guy is too busy playing video games instead of studying film
How bout dem Boys?😂😂😂😂
Was it true that one of the Cardinals cheerleaders was kicking the extra points.
Love that these short highlights have some replays in the big plays! Awesome. I didn't think they had those last year.
There is nothing I love more than watching the Cowboys LOSE!
To many commercials.👎
Like Stephen A Smith’s said, The  Cowboys an accident waiting to happen 😂
So are all these bots quote replying comments?😂😂😂
Cardinals good game. Use to love watching them beat Cowboys on the Holidays growing up as a kid.
It’s an American tradition to watch highlights when cowgirls lose.
Why so many ads... it's getting ridiculous... can't go 2 min without an ad
Wow. A _LOT_ of bots in this comment section.
And cowboy fans said making Smith would fix their run defense haha
Lord said no again...Dak threw interception
Dallas losing to a team one magazine predicted to have the worst season in NFL history (They predicted Arizona going 1-16) a tie for most losses with 2008 Detroit Lions at 0-16.
Prescott  is not worth the money hes being paid
Dakota Prescott is over rated needs to retire before he gets worse
BUD LIGHT COMMERCIAL? NFL GONE WOKE!
Now I KNOW these games are rigged and scripted.
“You couldn’t script it any better” 💀
Awesome.  The only thing better than the Cowgirls losing is when they lose to the Cardinals!
This was the Arizona Cardinals’ Super Bowl. HOW PATHETIC that you pour Gatorade on your coach after the game….SF and Eagles fan take notice…..these little loser teams wouldn’t do that if they beat you. @me
There is just something magical about Cardinals stadium
Any other eagles fans in here enjoying the show?
It’s all rigged anyways.
The amount of ads in these highlights is unnecessary
weakest jump ball attempt of all time by Lamb there. Just looking for a whistle and not going up and getting the ball
Lol I swear some organizations are in a curse period. After the first two cowboys games it was nonstop they’re back!! Dak is back!!! Then y’all lose to the cardinals with a backup QB?!?! Lmfao.
"What a win from the Cardinals"  My heart was pounding the whole time! What an intense match.
Hello cowboys fans. I wanted to say is that just because cowboys lost doesn't mean it's the end of the world we, have a very great team trust me. LETS GO COWBOYS🎉
Josh Dobbs can ball
Poorly executed play action pass turns out to most exciting play of the game imo
“Oh no what happened cowboys”
I’m a big Dallas fan and look like the same o Dallas won’t get pass the first round
Mccarthys decision making and time clock management is worse. Their red zone offensive playcalling fir dallas is just horrible! Offensive! And predictable! Literally a novice could mix it up and call better plays.
How TF the Cowboys lose? I can’t name a single player on the cardinals defense
I dont like watching highlights with the cowboys losing but its good to see the competitiveness that the cards had given them. Helluva game!
Maybe next year with trey Lance fam
What about Miami not having Ramsey?? They still winning
Glad Dallas is failing 🥂
Always a great day when the cowgirls lose
They needed that they needed that so they can see this ain't no game let's go to the super bowl Dallas
Washington and Dallas losing in the same week 👏🏾🦾🤜🤛🙏🏾🤘🏾🤟🏼🤙🏽🥉
If we would’ve cut the lead to 4 had time we got in the endzone and took the 2 pt conversion.
We gotta use Rico & Hunter more in the redzone
LVE is Slow
And so the epic choke begins! LMFAO!
What's with all these weird bot comments?
Collapse already happening for dA bOyS🤣
Why the Steelers got rid of Connor is beyond me he always gives 100 per cent
Great to see Dobbs play well.
Gatorade bath on game 3??  😅😅 Did i miss something??  Btw you can tell the coach was pissed about it...😅
It feels like theres a bunch of bots in the comments lol
What's up with all these bot comments?
So we’re in copper
Arizona just gotta be happy to have a QB that can see over the offensive line,  an Kyler Murray gotta be happy cause now he can focus on Call of Duty more 😂😂
Congrats Dobbs
“woooooo”
So dumb when they say “the rookie they are really high on” what rookie in any sport isn’t “high on” of course every single coach is gonna say that about their rookies. “Aahh no I don’t expect much from this 5th round receiver probably looking to trade him in a couple years”😂😂😂
As a cowboys fan. Nothing surprising 🤣🤣
Wasnt hhis first start though
1ST ZEKE LEAVES, NOW TREVON DIGGS IS OUT FOR THE SEASON 🫠🤦🏾‍♂️😢
It's crazy seeing every network crown my Cowboys after 2 weeks then when we lose in week 3, call us the worst fans lmao. You're welcome, Arizona 🎉
Anyone gunna note how easy this offense is moving the ball on everyone tho? 15-16 red zone visits in 3 games! Thats 90 points just in red zone visits! And did 6x15 bc an extra points aint always made or this offense just in red zone visits has had an opp of putting up 105 points in just 3 games!  The last 3 games dallas has put up 116 points and thats with them being 6-15 in the red zone!  This offense is dangerous they easily move  the ball just need to fix that red zone offense!
I expected another Cardinals disappointment.  But they surprised me.  Great game for them.
I'm so happy for Josh I'm steelers fan but he never really have one chance there keep it up.
I find it funny how people are surprised the Cardinals won. Their head coach was literally the DC for the Eagles. Had to deal with the ‘Boys twice a year for quite a while. If there was a list of the teams who have a great chance against the ‘Boys, they would’ve been high on the list.
Impressed. Shame the Cards completely packed it the moment the Giants showed any sign of life last week. There's some talent there and now they finally have a real head coach. Also love seeing Dobbs run with this chance & guaranteeing himself a roster spot (and at least top-tier backup QB money, if he doesn't end up going full Geno & landing at least a serious shot at a full-time starting gig/money somewhere) in the league for several years longer than he probably would have otherwise.
I'm a cardinal's fan. I don't care if we  lose as long as we Beat the cowboys
That’s tough. The cowboys defense. Tried their best. Offense let them down. Just me. I’d would have run it. But cardinals did exactly what they needed too . Amazing win for them.
Remember JAYLEN SMITH FROM NOTRE DAME COLLEGE.. Remember they let him go and kept VANDER😂
As a eagles fan I wanna say thank u to the cardinals u made my day 😁      And not only that but you guys got beat Dobbs an conner both 2 x steelers 😂
Belin , i Cowboy senza difesa e un QB da incubo
There are a lot of bots in these comments. They start with a quote (stolen from a top comment) and have a short remark afterwards. It’s like someone set up a Twitter quote tweet bot on YouTube.
It’s weird how everyone is either ignorant of or just leaving out the fact that almost our entire offensive line was benched because of injuries this week. The cowboys only had one lineman starting in this game that played in the last game.
10:37 “blud had no chance” 😂
Please never change, Cowboys!
Prater hits a 62 yard field goal at the half… why didn’t the Cardinals kick a PAT after the first TD?
When it was 9-0, why did the Cardinals go for 2?
Cowboys don't play good.😢😢😢
Beating the giants got to their heads.
aweful offensive play calls from mike.. clearly the problem wasnt kellen moore
I'm waiting to hear Skip Bayless's excuses, 😅 whining and 😭 crying about this game!
Bruh do people forget the Cardinals are 8-1 against the cowboys, yall people dont know football, but Dak is terrible today lol
6:15 - what a kick!  Powers it through the uprights with a line drive shot.
Jerry Jones. Born to lose
Who the hell is Dobbs? What happened to their other quarterback? I haven't paid much attention to football in the last year or so Pier
That was one of the best examples of blocking for a touchdown run I have ever seen.. on that Moore TD.
Before the game, they were saying parsons was the next Lawrence Taylor. Never seen him play so I’m watching 11. News kids, LT didn’t get run on. Think of a fast Aaron Donald, that was LT. When you played LT you worried about your injuries
I can't lie the cowboys are great entertainment they're a great team which at any point could lose to anyone 😂
DC4L
As a cowboys fan I don’t even care. As long as Daks our qb nothing will ever happen.
The fact that dak is still the qb is a joke. Definitely a race thing 😂
How many more seasons will Dallas waste with Prescott? They’ve had so many all star players surrounding him and still no results. Everyone blames McCarthy whenever something bad happens…..
Go Cards!
Si no gana el siguiente partido cowboys que cambien de QB
Cardinals should be 3-0
HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS!! 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🥲😂🤣😂🥲😂🥲😂🥲😂🥲😂🥲😂🥲🤣😂🤣🥲🤣
How many people hate the cowboys 👇🏽
Fantastic, intense playing by the Cardinals!!!  Great job guys!!!  I love to see Dallas lose.  👀 😊😅😅😅
Wise up JERRY JONES, trade Dak Trashscott for a QB that hasn't reached their ceiling yet.  If you can't trade him just cut your losses and move on to someone else because we Cowboys fans (the logical ones) know that Dak Trashscott is as good as he is going to get and that just isn't good enough. Put in a trade request for Justin Fields, Joshua Dobbs, hell even Zach Wilson, I have a strong feeling these guys would be better for the Cowboys in the future than Dak Trashscott. Just let him go and the team will turn to a more positive light a lot faster than being stuck in the mud with this mediocre QB for years to come.
Angry bird won starbucks
The nfl crammed the cowboys down our throats on Sunday. I'm still laughing.
Dobbs looks nice! Murray is in trouble!  Prescott looks horrible! Give Mr Lance a go!
All that hype 😂😂😂 i love watching them choke every year lol cant wait til the first round so i can say the same thing.
1st win. Calm down. 😙
I want to thank the Cowboys for destroying my parlay and costing me a 1700$ win
Back to reality for the Cowboys.
Why are we the only team that sips its own Kool aid every year and think that teams are just going to lay down and let us beat them same story every year
What kind of bot comments are these😂
As soon as the cowboys lost. I saw a big paragraph on Facebook on why they lost 😂
Stephen A Smith was like 🎉🎉🎉🎉 let's celebrate after watching the Cowboys lose to such a bad team.
Scooter MacGruder sitting in his bedroom in the dark until next week's game against my Patriots. 😂
Mistreated Dez Bryant.....
Dallas looking like peak playoff form
Trevon Diggs it’s hurting the Cowboys and he’s also a diva
The Cardinals have POOR tackling skills.! Other than that, Great game for them
Kyzir White that play led for West Virginia is on the Arizona Cardinals and he a had a big huge career stats in this game
Man when Rondale Moore is healthy...he's got all kinds of speed.
you know its bad when in the highlight reel it goes from the cards get a FG to the cards having the ball again lol
FIFTY 🦁 speaking Let Go 🦅 Dak Prescott play NEW England Patriots this week then 49ers did see what the BIRDS did to Mayfield we ready I believe Dak Prescott will take two more L New England Patriots and to the 49ers where my 🦅 fans at comment let me know Stephen A and Shannon what y'all think
Don't tell me it's hard to score in the NFL ever again🤣... 0-2 Dobbs🤔.. Philly bet not lay an egg.
Dobbs😂🤔
Cowboys beat themselves
Will McCarthy's Texas Toast offence cut it this season?
In classic Dak fashion he takes his team out of a position to win with a solid interception in the Red zone!😂
When you'll get rid of Prescott that's when you start winning
Dallas can keep "Cowboys" but Washington had to lose "Redskins" which, in a hard physical game, is a salute to their courage, bravery and shows respect. Funny that, since the White American settlers and Cowboys persecuted and then displaced the indigenous American "Redskins".  This is where political correctness converges with white supremacy.
Parson was wrong about #1 Defense
Always good to see a bunch of Big Ole Dirty, Nasty Cowboys gittin' da tar beat outta 'em, 'specially by some 'ornery Red Birds peckin' all ova dem noggins afta gittin' em ugly gallin' hatz Offa dey hedz!!
I'm a graduate of Univ. of Tennessee Class of '22, Woo Hoo. I love Josh Dobbs and I always root 4 him, just didn't expect him to beat my Cowboys, still luv Dobbs Tho in spite of the loss. Go Vols, Go Cowboys!!! 🧡🧡💙💙
Get dak out of hur! New QUARTERBACK ASAP
Weee deem boyz 😂
Yeah Cowboys have everything except a QB. Great job to the Cardinals!
How Bout, Them cardnals. They Beat Them Cowgirls, Babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! Ow.
GBO 🍊  Dobbs a VFL 🎉
Arizona has potential to be a great team
49 ers play them Sunday got hold josh down we get the win😮
I heard some Trey Lance calls already, my god they give up on Dak so fast.
So Happy for Dobbs finally getting a chance to start🙏🏼😎
What NFL announcers are these ?
My niners will run it down their throats. I have CMC on fantasy. We gone have a good day....
I like Dobbs over murray
Purdy is an anomaly that has overwhelming coaching staff support. Anyone who's ever played knows how that goes
Tua might have the best wr to ever play the game on his team now lol.
Peyton couldn't get Superbowl #2 until he went and plays for one of the best broncos rosters ever including WR talent!
D Hopkins made every QB in Texans uniform a Star!
Anyone who played with Steve Smith went to work!
Dobbs might be better than Murray, they need to think about that in Arizona.
CD lamb is not DeZ Bryant... never will be.. smh y'all need Dez
Sam Howell looks good because of the wr group and play calling.. josh Allen doesn't make diggs better.. desean Watson was blessed with Hopkins. Herbert blessed with Mike and Allen
Name a QB who put up huge numbers with average receivers?
Only 4 Quarterbacks in history truly elevated play around them... Lets not make DAK superman. He's a QB on a roster with no offensive identity
Prescott Is a joke.
Play action, turn around and people are in your face... this one ain't on Dak
I just absolutely love to watch Dallas lose! It feels sooo good
It's too bad Dak can't throw like that.  Cardinals QB quite the winner
The cardinals are not a bad team!! They are sneaky good!!
Jitterbug what does that even mean? Like gigadoo...
A feel-good win against a feel-bad team.  Let's go Cards!
As an eagles fan thanks cowboys.
This is a cardinals highlight reel🔥
I credit Arizona DC's for putting together a very good strategy to stop Dallas.👏🏻
Cowboys always choke Dak is Not it 😂
As an Eagles diehard, I could rub it in. You Dallas fans make it easy. I'm not going to though, and I'll tell you why. It is way too early in the season, to be hitting copious amounts of hopium. You guys beat two depleted New York teams and acted as if you were superbowl champs. This is what talk gets. Its too soon. Dallas will be fine though. Exposed a little bit this game but at least it happened early enough in the season to make corrections. I'm not going act like we are the best team since ever after week 2 or 3. Eagles have an extremely tough schedule coming up too. Best luck to you dallas lovers. And Arizona, good game. Balled out.
I know Dallas was at Arizona but still come on the most intimidating thing about the cardinals is there field 😂
These ads get more horrible every week. Went from one ad during a 10 minute video to six 30 second ads. What a joke
Cowboys trying to resign Dion Sanders
Very impressive Cardinals!  I don't think I've ever seen them play this good.  As for Cowboys ... Get rid of Dak if you want to win consistently.
The problem with the cowboys is Dak Preskcott he is a loser loser loser and they will keep on losing with a loser!!!
I wanted Dobbs to start for Cleveland years ago... Love to see this
Same story every year tony Roma was they only hope of getting a ring
Way to go Josh Dobbs! Congrats! From rocket science to your opportunity with the cardinals, much more success young man!
Dobbs out played Prescott by a ton. I have great respect to Dobbs for doing well. Prescott actually played in this game like Prescott has played for a number of years before injuries.  I don't get it with liberal sympathizers. They elevate Dak Prescott to this super high level of QB constantly. Prescott played well for a short time when he entered the league. But the League Teams figured out Dak Prescott.  Since then, Dak hasn't improved his game but has gotten worse. I think this is why Dallas went after the Ex San Fran QB. If Dak blows games, watch if the EX SF QB starts picking up minutes.  Dak Prescott has a bevy of great players around him. Problem with Prescott he ends up being a fool and screws up.  --- how long will Dak Prescott be a QB with Dallas is the question. -- Jones might have a short leash on Dak's playing. It's how fast can the newly acquired EX San Fran QB learn Dallas plays.
As a Browns fan, its great to see Dobbs lead his team to a victory over a quality opponent, especially agaisnt "Not America's Team".
Now I know that Arizona has beaten Dallas in recent years but this time I was sure the Cowboys would beat them. Low and behold Arizona really came out and made enough plays on both sides to win the game. I still don’t understand how threw a triple covered interception.
Poor Dallas, they are stuck with a bad Quarterback and a bad Owner. Never the Twain shall meet.
My cards got lucky but hey we will take it.
Don't worry Cowboys... the 49ers will punish them next week for this destruction.
Dobbs 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great week for an Eagles fan! Commanders lost, Cowgirls lost, Giants lost and Eagles win. GO BIRDS!!!! 🏈🦅
Why is Efren Herrera playing defense..
Was that Craig Morton trying to make a tackle..
Gilmore gave up a rushing td..
Lol... we all knew this was coming. How satisfying after all that week 1 + 2 hype.
Stephon Gilmore has definitely lost a step or 2
This was an amazing game!! Classic on why I love the sport football
Man the Cardinals were just FEELING IT and were NOT scared!! To put up 28 on one of the best NFL defenses is amazing.    They really played as a team.. you love to see it! 👏🏻 👏🏻
Losing to the worst team in the league is a cowboys thing
As a OG Ravens' fan (96) the only fans i dis like as much as begirls fans is the cowgirls fans🤣🤣🤣🤣
Listen Cowboys fans…If you and your owner didn’t talk “this is our year” every single year, we wouldn’t find every one of your losses so hilarious.   Just be chill and play the games. Stop acting like you’re destined for the Super Bowl all the time. It’s your arrogance that makes you look so silly. You do it to yourself 💯
Cowboy breaking a 🐎
Cowboys Always Break The Bronc
REMEMBER, WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND...
I can’t stand the cowboys and every time they lose is a celebration   That 62 yard FG though!
As Brou said  Dobbs, Brown, Conner take a bow !!!  actually all the team take a bow
Uk, as a steelers fan I've always wanted Dobbs to get a shot. Granted, not the best, stares down the recievers a bit much. But im glad that he's finally starting
What the hell is up with all these fake accounts and fake comments on this video?!  Quoting themselves in THEIR comments for no reason lol  So many comments are the same and are fake.
You guys Cowboys, let's go to Super Bowl with me!!!!! (in Madden 24 lol)
All those Cowboy fans spending all that money to travel and go to this game expecting to see an absolute massacre, hell of a walk of shame to the airport that must have been 😂
How ‘bout them cowgirls!
Super Bowl favorites 😂🤡
This must be a traditional thing where all nfl fans come together to laugh when dem boyz come with such hype then lose like this
How AZ lost to NJ Midgets is beyond me. AZ should at least be 2-1. NJ Midgets Gould be sitting 0-3.
We will comeback
How many games is it gonna take for Dak to get replaced? 5? 7?
Wasn't a bad loss . Just came up short
Gannon needs to loosen up man 😂
What tf was Dak looking at that last throw
what are they doing winning, they are suppose to be tanking.
I've been watching games now that I finally got a TV again.  I'd get nauseous seeing all the Cardinals players succeeding elsewhere, some traded off for a song.  Thank goodness they kept the running backs & Greg Prater.  All of them were huge in this game & some rookies on the offense (Wilson & Johnson) played a big part too.  So proud of this team.  There's a lot of fight in them.  No 0-17 this year.
The refs remain undefeated...
Cowgirls
Man my WR Gallup was eating out there.  Finally got to show Cowboys that he been back.  Just throw him the ball more.  Geesh
(AS FAITH WOULD HAVE IT, LIKE ALWAYS), THE COWBOYS ARE NOTHING BUT HYPE, AND THEIR SUPPORTERS ARE FILLED WITH HOT AIR, GOING NO WHERE FAST! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol and Cowboys fans were talking about winning the division this year 🤡🤡🤡
Cardinals lost to the Giants after that historic come back by the Gmen yet Giants get blown out on week 1 to the Cowgirls and yet the Cowgirls lost to an 0-2 team!!...... maaaaan any given Sunday ladies and gentlemen.
Parsons sack if you watch he was offsides
Cowboy's lose diggs and then do this was diggs the whole team 😂😂
Cowboys had way too many chances
Pollard is a million times better than Zeke
Cardinals are legit, they gonna earn some respect and make the playoffs...
Cowboys start 2-0. Cowboys fans "its our year!! We are winning the Superbowl!!!!" Cowboys lose to the Cardinals by double digits 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Classy win! 👍🤗  M 🦘🏏😎
This game cost me 350k....literally if cowboys win i hit my 8 way parlay
Dak wont lead the Cowboys back to the promised land...he will get us near but we have to wait until the end of this season and get Trevor Lawrence to take us to a Superbowl in 2024/25!
They didn’t believe in us God did
Cardinals trying to lose the game but yet Cowboys somehow lost the game lol
So many holding p not called
Cowboys ready for the Superbowl after this performance 🔥🔥🔥
More like Dallas Soyboys
tf goin on with alla these bots inna comment section lmao
I can't wait for week 5.😂
Hell of performance all around for the Cards.
How To Go From #1 in NFL Team Red Zone Scoring Percentage in 2022 to 27th in three games in 2023 - An Introduction to Mike McCarthy Football.
Great game by the cards and James Connor props to them!!!  🙌🙌🔥
Why the hell did Pittsburgh ever let Conner go? That was dumb
Big love to Josh Dobbs, man. He really earned his spot. Good win, Cards.
Screw Murray, this Dobbs guy is fantastic.
10:45 Dak Prescott in a nutshell
the bl*cks keep robbin jerry
I thought the Cardinals were tanking for Caleb ? Just checking in to see of yall still dem boys 😂
youtube commercials are ridiculous
Where the Arizona is tanking crew....
daks up there with zach wilson
I been rooting for Dobbs since Tennessee days
CARDINALS! CARDINALS! CARDINALS! CARDINALS! CARDINALS! CARDINALS! CARDINALS! CARDINALS!
Dak is the Jimmy G for the 9ers. :D
Dobbs a dawg
Same ol'e sorry Cowboys. Same ol'e sorry Prescott. Yeah Jerry,just keep signing those sorry players to multiple years and big contracts
Great Running Game for the Cardinals!! <always lots of hope for the Arizona Cardinals, sometimes you're sure what year it will happen> <Cardinals versus the Cowboys, that's sort of a cross-town rivalry>
Classic Cowboys choking against a draft-lottery team once again. Love it.
Interesting how Cowboy fans were making fun of the 49ers for only scoring 30pts on the Giants; then proceeds to say they are ready for the 49ers. How are yall ready when yall can’t even beat the worst team in the NFC West? Also, Giants put up 28 on the Cards’.
We always beat them
What the...  This Giants fan approves 1000%
HOW???
Dallas coulda won that game dang no RedZone presents
Lucky win
I knew Josh Dobbs was no joke. People giving jags fans sh** over almost losing to him last year. Lmao he is no joke.
These new coaches are solid. Example: Look at the play design where a wide receiver (Wilson for example) is the lead blocker after coming off motion, which helps give Conner a big gain. Excellent.
Cards really looked good
As usual,the Cowboys won two games and got cocky and started talking Super Bowl. Then a 0-2 team that was a 12 point underdog,crushed them. Also,Dak stunk it up the entire game!!
Let’s go Cardinals
Dobbs keeps it up ? The man is bound for a starting position, somewhere. Like Dallas, maybe.
winning the LOS against the team still has me in shock.
How bout them Cowboys!
The cardinals is built to be just like the dolphins I hope the realize that
You know, if I had a nickel for every time the Cowboys suffered a shocking upset loss against Arizona, I'd have four nickels, which isn't much, but it's hilarious that it's happened four times!  (1998 Wild Card Playoffs) (2008 Regular Season, game ending punt block for TD) (2011 Regular Season, helped kick off 4 losses in 5 games for Dallas, which missed the playoffs) And then there's this game.
1. Never take points off in the game (unless it is the last five minutes - go of broke) 2. HORRIBLE...HORRIBLE play calling "COACH!" 3. Offensive line needs work - play better. 4. "STOP" with the field goals. 5. Needs to score "TOUCHDOWNS" in the Red Zone.
Cowboys every year are overrated
Dak should’ve pumped at 8:16
As a Steelers fan, happy for Dobbs , Connor
Josh Dobbs picks up playbooks so fast and he's such a great QB
How about them Cowboys😂
Cardinals play tough
Cowboys were due to get humbled. Sports talk shows know this but they get paid to tell you this year could be different. They do this every year, win a couple easy games and start beating their chest like they're good (they're not). Maybe parsons will calm down with the doomsday tweets now.
Never heard of Joshua Dobbs before.  How did no one see this coming?
Imagine watching these highlights and thinking that Dak Prescott was the reason the team lost. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Jets fan here; the Cardinals look so much better than the Jets although everyone was thinking the Jets would go SB and Cardinals would tank.  I may root for the Cardinals this season, I liked what I saw; especially the offensive play design and play calls.  good luck.
Prescott  Out
Cowboys are a joke
man, the cards don't look 0-2
Good for the cards confidence
Dobbs is way better than Kyler Murray
"The cowboys defense is the most unstoppable force in the NFL"  "Will this be their Super Bowl year?"  "This team looks like a formidable foce"  "WE DEM BOYZ"   *loses to the worst team in the NFL the following week   It's become the same story every year for the past decade lol
Nice win cardinals.
My condolences if you bet on Dallas
Wow cowboy players how you supposed to get to the Superbowl if you can't get pass cardinals whatcha gonna do when you come up against 49ers and I'ma cowboy's fan too
Conner keeps running like that and he’ll have his first 1000yd season
How much do they pay that qb
Dak Prescott gotta be better for the Cowboys or else they gettin bounced by the niners in the playoffs again.
I don't wanna hear any given Sunday that's fake listen cowboy players either you wanna win a Superbowl or you don't it's the same ole thing year in and year out so tired of the excuses
I betted on this game on betmgm smh I went for dallas smh never again
What the hell just happened
I guess us fans can't say how we feel about Dallas cowboys you say something true they take your comments down it's been time for the Dallas cowboys to win a Superbowl I'm guessing no one else can get it done. S A D
As a niner fan I’m glad that I was able to watch this game
One of the most impressive coaching jobs I've seen against a power team.
There's no more excuses dak has elite wrs around him good running backs , tight ends so forth so on no more excuses either get a Superbowl or sell the team to somebody who really wants one
All the quarter backs we had none of them can win I mean it's been since Troy Aikmen nobody finds it questionable.sad really sad I'm sorry no I'm no sad
I'm serious it's sickening anymore you mean to tell me we can't never get to the Superbowl with all the great teams we had come on something smells fishy
Gannon is like a lot of people in Pro sports these days.   Doesn't inspire confidence with so much PC speak in press conferences.  That's why I love Belichick and those like him.  But Gannon's first win is against the Cowboys.  Respect & hope he can take the Cardinals to high places.  IMO, potential Purdy alert.  While no one may be thinking of Dobbs pulling the rug out from under Murray, maybe we should.    Murray inspired no confidence in the post season and acts too spoiled & entitled for someone in his position with his abilities.
Every year it's either the defense that's doing really good or it's the offense can't believe that we can't win another Superbowl since Troy Aikmen talking about sad we need to start wearing bags over our heads
Offense showed up more than the defense. Our defense plays a huge factor. Cardinals played to expectations
Dak be sellin tf outta games🤦🏿‍♂️
Cowboys fan here. Great game by the Cardinals. We are used to QBs letting us down and half the O-line being out with injury. Hell, Smith is making a career out of it. Glad the loss could bring some light to the rest of the league's fans. The comment section tells me ya'll really needed a win in some form.
Whatever makes Vegas the most money is what’s gonna happen in the NFL.  It’s fake, fixed, pretend football.  They are athletic actors.  Nothing more, nothing less
Cowboys going full Cowboy
it's funny to see the haters and the cowboys fans comments...do u guys have any idea how much vegas and the betting sites made with this cowboys loss? exactly
Imagine being a redneck cowboys fan
I can't take this anymore!! WHY does dak keeps throwing into TRIPLE coverage? Dak needs to be benched ASAP!!! 😡
Cowboy hype lasted 2 games 😅😅
Such a cowboys loss.
Hahahaha!!!
cardinals got lucky😂
The Cardinals will fo back to being irrelevant next week, with their backup albuno chemo patient looking QB and everyone will still be riding the Cowboys, because that's all you all do, every season.
Too many injuries for Dallas. It's sad that all it takes is a handful of injuries and we get the old cowboys back (the ones that miss the playoffs/lose first round. Not the 90s ones)
Every year the same b.s to tell you the truth I'm a cowboys fan since 75 they're never getting another Superbowl plain and simple
Dallas loses one game and the haters come out of the woodwork. Never fails. Living rent free since 1960.
Great win AZ 👍
*I'm happy Cardinals beat Cowboys.. pay back for my Giants*
*Knew Cowboys was just a Fluke*
The Cowboys and Dak need to focus. Beating  Belicheat and the Pats this week would go a long way to making them a legit threat in the NFC.
I knew Dobbs was good! See him and Geno smith battle it out! Good games*
Nice work, Cards.
Titans  should have kelp  Dobbs and cut malik  Willis.,
As long as Dakota Prescott is the quarterback Dallas will never win anything
Cowboys forgot to play ball.
Nothing warms my cold dead heart quite like watching the Cards beat the Cowboys.  Thank you for that, Cardinals. Now, feel free to resume the tank job.
They play better when Kyler isn’t out there pouting like a little baby and bringing everyone down.
That was rough to watch yesterday.
Dobbs looks good. Keep starting him when Murray comes back
Seems like the Cards dont need Kyler Murray. Theyve looked better without him so far
Dak will never be an elite QB.
Lo de Doe Doe! Let's see, the Cowboys are going where, hummm... As I mentioned they azzes is gonna be sit'n in the stands At the SuperBowl wit me, If they going! Smdh.. All Hype, as usual... smdh
Dallas had 3 trips down the 10 yard line but only added 6 points. They just couldn't close. Very frustrating.
despite the record the Cards played every game though. Only losing by 3/4 points in the previous games.
How they throw a penalty for pass interference but decide to pick it up 😂
What is going on with all of the repeat comments on these NFL games? If you read far enough down the page, you will see the same comments three times. Is this AI already infiltrating into YouTube and trying to sound like humans when they comment?  One comment I thought was funny was someone wondering if Dak will ever show he is an elite QB. That is very funny, because most have known for several seasons this is not the case. Maybe he is trying to be like Tony, get to the playoffs, but lose spectacularly after some "only Dallas" way to lose.
How bout them cowboys 😂
NFC west cooking,, first Rams and now Cardinals!
What happened to Ronald Jones?
8:29 How do you miss that obvious of an offsides call?
I'm mad bc the cardinals could have been 3-0 but I'll take a dubb
COWBOYS LOST TO CARDS LOL
Hahaha this is funny I bet if my cowboys would’ve won y’all energy wouldn’t be the same so would Stephan A😂😂😂 yall would make excuses say “cardinals wasn’t even that good” look at yall man😂😂😂
I am such a sucker for underdogs. So I loved to see the Cardinals win!
Cardinals arent tanking and arent taking Caleb. All lies made up by the media
Cowboys showing us once again why they’ll be overhyped every season and just like every season will be a first round exit.
Dak throwing picks 😮again!!!!!
No one really thinks Dallas is the best team😂
On any given sunday, anybody can win.
So the Cardinals aren't tanking? Interesting! So this means that the Houston Texans are winning the Tank Bowl (while Arizona takes their 1st round pick in process). Also, I get to laugh at arrogant Cowboys fans. Keep saying you winning the Super Bowl Cowboys, we all know it's going to be a 2nd round playoff exit at best.
glad them girlies lost
When Dallas lose America win
Like Rod Tidwell Say Show Me The Money
Dak is the problem. Has been every year past his rookie season.
Cowgirls Fans got all cocky being Braggarts about being The Best Team In The NFL until The Cards 2nd String Quarterback outplayed The Cowgirls Defense 🤣🤣🤣🤣
James Conner is a beast
Welp, now people will overrate the Cards, and the Cowboys were already overrated by some. And my Niners will be 5-0 to start off the season 😂
all this proves is that anybody can beat the cowgirls
10:44 Pollard is wide open as can be, fergerson was more wide open then Cooks, why tf would dak throw into triple coverage
Bro this game showed us everything we needed to see from dak he can get you by but at any moment you asking him to win the game for you your asking for to much 😴
These Cowboys can't handle the Wild West  🤠🔫🌵
what happened to cowboys o line?
Of course an ex eagle would finish them chumps off💯
As a steelers fan always said Dobbs should of played
Dallas fans thought they were going to win. Nope sorry cowgirls maby next time...no hard feelings!!!!
😮
The cowboys beat the giants , giants beat cardinals and yea you know what’s next just cowboys things
So no more Super Bowl Delusional cowboy fans prediction? So soon? 😂. As stated any available QB for trade is an upgrade for the Dallas cowboys.
As a cowboys fan I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again DAK PRESCOTT IS NOT THE MAN WE NEED
Go dobbs -Steelers fan
The boys choked
Just wondering. How many starting offensive lineman did Dallas have out? Oh yea 3. Smith, Martin and Biadasz. But keep this same excitement haters.
How many flat screen TV's were destroyed?!!! 😢
Always a great day when the cowgirls lose!!!!
y'all should know by now Never believe or trust Dallas when they say they the best team coming into the new season 😄 Smh  they the best at Spazzn out
How tf do they give up a 3TD lead to the Jersey Large People, yet stomp the Cowboys D? I mean I love it for the Schadenfreude so thank you sm.
The cowboys have played 3 of the worst 5 teams in the league and are  2-1 and fans think theyre great 😂
Week five gonna be a long day for cowboy defenders if they play the run like they did yesterday.
Like I’ve been saying for years now, cowboys aren’t ever seeing a superbowl with Dak at qb!
😂😂😂😂lol
Conner was crazy at this game Good game Arizona
Lolcowboys!
9-8.   Bounced out in the first round.  Another successful season eh Jerruh??????
You Know Stephen A Is Going To Enjoy This
This is a very classic example of a team overlooking a team they thought was a weak team
....when hype doesn't equal the output...lol...top defense, Dak is so great ---> what a joke...lol...love it.....
Yeeeeeaaaaaa!!!!!
DaLlAs Is An ElItE tEaM
Cowboys have a weak run defense
Any given Sunday. 😢
why dobbs run like that lol
we lost 40-0 to these bums
Let’s Go Cards
Congratulations 🎉
Go Cardinals ❤️🤍🖤❤️🤍🖤❤️🤍🖤❤️🤍🖤❤️🤍🖤❤️🤍🖤❤️🤍🖤❤️🤍🖤
I gotta say this Dobbs kid is a better fit at QB for the Cards than Kyler Murray.
VANDER gota go hes to slow man !!!!
Ahh, the cowpunks, they never fail to fail.
Why TF didn't vanderesh tackle Moore on that long run. Not a cowgirls fan, but sheesh that was a bad play by him.
Eagles fans say....Go Dak ..threw that perfect pass into the end zonefor an ..... INTERCEPTION.way to blow another game to a stinky team
La difesa si Dallas si è presa una domenica di riposo... Con più la riguardo, con più e incedibile quello che è successo... Spero che i cowboys imparino da questa sconfitta
Oh No Oh No not the girls 🤣
They need to keep Dobbs and bench calamari--I mean Kyler Murray!
Why Dak love throwing into triple coverage lol
Cowboys secondary looked clueless without Diggs
Im a commanders fan and i bet on the Cowboys this week and lost. It's my karma!
I'm so happy for Josh dobbs I wish we could have kept him at Tennessee as quarterback but I'm happy to see him succeed in any team he is with
Man we really are Americas Team 💯😭 look at all these Cowboys haters taking their time to comment
THANK YOU Arizona for Slappthe Taste out the Cowboys Mouth feels Great
Dak WTF WERE U THINKING AT @10:40
This just shows how bad of a coach Kliff Kingsbury was. This roster is much worse than what he had
Dak... Is just out Therr'r l👀k @ his look off tactics "well the lack thereof he look like a clown thief on Video sticking a candy bar in his Helmet & once he throws the ball the Defense Police bust him!" Dak have no improv nor street ball play skills! Speaking of *Plays THAT Cowboy Playbook is Janky AF!
Played y’all first semi decent team and oh how semi decent y’all look🤣🤣🤣 wait till y’all get to the real teams before talking lmao y’all lost to the cardinals🤣🤣🤣
HAHAHAHAHAHA!
Cowboys hurt themselves with 13 penalties, uncreative plays in red zone with 1 for 5 inefficiency and Prescott not using audibles and his legs when nobody's open. Cowboys are going to settle for a lot of red zone field goals this season as long as Prescott won't use his legs, because he's a mediocre QB.
the cowgirls will never change😌
Are we not going to talk abou their offensive line. I mean good lord, the cowboys couldn't stop the run. And they gave ther QB so much time.
Weird how much money all those parlays must have lost, has nothing to do with that at all..nope
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS
I swear i hate the cowboys white uniforms
Same story every year with the Cowboys. "The defense is the reincarnation of the 85 Bears defense. Parsons' is the Second Coming of Lawrence Taylor, the best offensive line in the history of the NFL," blah blah blah. They are an average team.
Washington was actually very lucky to beat the Cardinals. It just makes you wonder how they could come up with a guy like Dobbs while other teams like the Jets or the Bears just can’t find anybody for decades even with high draft picks.
Jerry will have to buy a new lucky rabbits foot or else the cowboys may lose 6 games
Dak is the sole reason this game was lost, he needs to be able to adapt without some of his key players and be able to get the ball out within 3 seconds 🤦🏽‍♂️
Why the Cowboys let anyone wear the number 21 is beyond me 🤷🏾‍♂️
Before the game the chats we're full of Dallas fans boasting...not many Cardinals fans were chatting. I'm so glad Cards won this one. Those new coaches are amazing!! Conner is a beast, Josh Dobbs (go Vols!!) is proving to be a great QB, Kyzir White is the man, and jitterbug Rondale - keep it going!! So many great Cards stepped up!! Cards Nation is PROUD!! 🔥
Where is the GREAT Micah Parsons!🤣
The fact that this has a 1,000,000 views already is crazy. 😂😂
5050 the deffense to play good in the 4th
There's them cowboys we all hate to love for a minute they had most of us fooled😂
Nice 🦵 🏉 62 yarder from Prater!!! And what a great overall effort from AZ to get their first win this season against DAL!!!
Cardinals defense needs work. Good game.
Cowboys ruined my parlay last time I’m putting money on these flukes
Nooo cowboys 😢😢
I like the Cardinals this year, even if they are not on everyone’s radar
Dawg, why would AZ attempt a 2pt. Conv though? To make it 11 pts. Instead of 10? Make it make sense...
I wouldve given them Hunter Loepke ALL DAY!!! LOL  I thought Branden Cooks was our speed guy to stretch the field.??  I rarely see him open and they are all short passes.  Gallup looked good.  I think we should go with Lamb, Gallup, Tolbert, Lopeke, Fergason.  Sprinkle in some Dowdle.
They can’t tank anyway they a qb
My last time watching nfl films, too many commercials. There are other videos
It’s always a happy day when Cowtoys lose a game. Their annoying fans hide in their caves when that happens… .
Cardinals are now 3-0 vs the cowboys in the 2020’s
Cardinals предыдущие две игры провели качественно и боролись на победу в каждой из них, поэтому этот успех в матче против Cowboys абсолютно заслуженный.  Cardinals - это главный положительный сюрприз на старте сезона.  Для Cowboys сохраняются привычные отрицательные черты - низкая эффективность персонала атаки при игре в чужой RZ.  Cowboys получили свою порцию похвалы за феноменальный матч против Giants и теперь буду возвращаться к своей привычной нестабильности
Dak and zeke should have been a package deal. Nobody listens lol
This is a story of Dobbs man 😇😇😇
Where are the Cowboys fans who claimed that their defense is the best in NFL. I told y’all once in the first week that you’re all talk and no action. Definitely worst fanbase in NFL… . I can’t resize how Shannon Sharpe & Stephen A. Smith ranked Cowtoys in top 5 NFL teams. They’re not even top 10. They won’t even clinch the playoffs. Mark my words.
Dallas can't stop the run oh s###t.
as a dallas fan, we are the most up and down team. lose games tht should be a walk in the park. dak is the definition of mid… 3 red jerseys on cook yeah i’ll throw it. tf!
I been telling folks the Cowboy defense is too aggressive. A running  QB is going to cause them a lot of problems.
Did they give the coach a Gatorade shower? It's 1 game, but seeing it was the Cowboys I guess they got excited. They played at home. They played well. Good win.
Cowboys playing like they already made it to the Superbowl
Niners are officially the best team in the NFC
so sick of watching Doc's Play... kick him out please
All the casuals surprised the cardinals are good hahaha
whats wrong with dem cowboys
GO VOLS
Prater the kicking GOAT!!!!
Lmfao well... there it is
I guess diigs was the d.
Dak and mccarthy have to go..end of story
Dak is dumb or a traitor.
Here we go again with Cowboy's great inconsistency!  ???????
dallas has the no. 1 d?lol
i may root for the Cardinals now.Dak needs to sit.
Cowboys: We're legit Super Bowl contenders, baby! Cardinals: Shhhh!
Dak is always good for a boneheaded pick when the game is on the line.  As a Dallas fan, he’s a mediocre QB.
Cardinals got their QB in NoHo Hank
Love it- battle of the coaching turds!! Dobbs played great and made QB-wth irrelevant- maybe QBwth can study more and wine less?!
Kyler will be back sooner than what we expected
Them boys Super Bowl ready for sure!!😂😂
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaaha hehehehehehe hahahahahahahahahahaha TY Arizona xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxxoxoxoxoxxooxxoxoxox
Not a good showing by the Cowboys. They did not play bad, just that AZ played very very well. Cowboys D needs to work on Run defense.
I keep hearing it’s the refs fault lol
Cardinal's Super Bowl.
Happy to see the cowboys back in form
Good game by the Cards but their open field tackling was horrible.
On any given Sunday! Just ask the Jags. Hey, at least we aren't Bear fans.
The cardinals scored 28 against THAT defense with THAT quarterback? Hopefully Bienimy finally gets some credit
8 straight games of Cardinals vs Cowboys: 7 wins by Cardinals, 1 Cowboys. So many people lost money yesterday without looking at this stat.
Gotta give the AZ credit for humbling the Cowboys
How bout dem 'boys😅
Shouldn't have gone for it on 4th and 4 toward the end of the 3rd, Dallas. Take the FG and you're within a TD ANYWAY  smh
Prescott proving once again… he’s not worth the paper his checks a written on.
Out coached, passing was horrible, pass completions, run after catch and Penalties. Cowboys should have picked up Dobbs when he was out looking for a team. Dak's gotta go.
How about dem cowboys
The cards just proved everyone wrong. Congrats.
dobbs is good and prescott needs to calm himself!
I'm not worried as a Hawks fan, but as a Hawks fan, I'm terrified.
Thank you for beating America team. I know u did it for America.
"What CAN go wrong WILL go wrong!!!!" -Stephen A. Smith😭😭😭😂😂😂😂
We love you Josh! So proud to see you doing your thang out there!
If stopping the run is going to be their defensive weakness, good luck beating the Eagles.
I heard Suh and linval Joseph available Dallas. Since y’all can’t stop the run lol
As a cowboys fan, Dak and our offense are my biggest concern. If our defense doesn't hold up to the typical standard, I don't think Dak x the offense has the independent strength to win games consistently. Got love for Dak but I wish he gave me more confidence in our offence as a whole.
Cards have been playoff ready they just cant close a game to save their careers. Zero finishing power. Prater needs a raise at this point in the season
Love Dobbs
Screw the cardinals🤮🤮🤮
How can you tell me football is scripted? Amazing performance by the Cardinals.
Jerry Jones: that Mike Mac D was looking really crazy like swiss cheese. That's horrible game planning.
Too many ads.
Oh yea already knew that cardinal would win even tho I ain’t a cardinal fan lol 😂
COWBOYS WHAT HAPPENED
And let's hear what all them cowboys fans have to say now .Two wins and y'all had already put yourself in the Superbowl.😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂….The Girls
Same ol Dak lol. Master choke artist
Conner ran allllll over dem Boyz 🤣🤣💀
Dobbs is legit
Wait, is the season still open?..I thought the Cowgirls had won the Superbowl already.  lmao. 😂
The bookies must love the Cards 😂😂 not that the national entertainment league had anything to do with it 🤔
It's a shame the NFL continues its practice of using spoilers in the thumbnails for these videos.  Each thumbnail prominently shows the winning team and an important star.  Please stop spoiling these videos for your fans.
Its the game that can change the entire season for the cards ! What a game ! Josh dobbs outplayed dak prescott ! James Connor is a legit RB !
Dak blaming the media is hilarious 😂😂😂😂
Dallas get their fans hyped up every year they will not win the NFC east or go to the superbowl.
I hope this is a lesson learned for Dallas cowboys offense got to step up their game four times in the endzone and still can't score and throws interception unacceptable I'm sorry I was saying this the last two games we won but I still got hopes for him I do believe we can do it this year 💯 FACTS.
Dak in playoff form 😂 throwing into triple coverage in the redzone with the game on the line 🤣🤣🤣 -Eagles fan
How bout them ——        Skippy Bayless
As a Cardinals fan , I can say that I'm proud 🎉 Dallas always chockes with The red birds.
Here comes the Cowboys.
This is what happens to the Cowboys when they play against a good team. Jets and Giants were gimmies /shi#
why waste ANOTHER YEAR with #4?  you know what he is, move on from him NOW
Same ole Dak same ole Dallas ,why did they get Cooks if they are not going to throw down field I feel bad for Lamb he's being wasted over there
Typical CowTerds💩💩 , SUPER BOWL 58 is OURS . 🌉🌉🌉🌉 BEST in the NFL #TheCITY#49ERS#BANGBANG
Dallas Beaten by Arizona- poor!
Thank you cardinals for making my day 😂
3:02 #55 could have made the tackle.
Gotta say the Cardinals sure look good the team for eat the team was certain was good an egririgous tank this job.
Good sad morning from the Cowboys Fan.. We will get the next game.. I’ve had my morning coffee, watch reviews and took my we loss medication… folks it was still a wonderful game, let’s be thankful to be able to enjoy these events win or lose…
Huckleberry finn
Steelers owe Dobbs and Connor an apology lol
How???
10:43 is why you’re here
The fact that they don’t even show the end zone pass that cardinals PI on which would have changed the entire game says how clearly there is a agenda against the cowboys. No one even wants to comment or acknowledge that the refs are changing the outcome of games cause of either their corrupt or inept and incapable of doing a even decent job! Humiliating for football and the refs
He sold the game the RB was the best choice
How about them cowboys
I'm sure that this was unintentional, but, thank you for sacrificing your Tank plan to secure the #1 pick by helping the 49ers by giving us an edge for the #1 seed over the Cowgirls.
though arizona's defense was awful, they very easily beat the cowboys. dallas won't make it far if they reach the playoffs
Okay so Cowboys DESTROY Giants, Giants beat Cardinals, and Cardinals beat Cowboys? Welcome to the NFL.
I’d be embarrassed if I was in New York in charge of these referees
Nice
Cowboys are still better
Good job cardinals I am a giants fan so I feel bad WHAT A COMEBACK BY US but I am happy they beat our division rival the cowboys
It’s not like the cardinals beat anyone good 🤷🏽‍♂️
Guess we know who really is the number one team now
The Cardinals have always played the Cowboys tough,going back to when they were in St.Louis.
😂😂😂😂😂
Slow down the video, the defender waved to Dak that he was open before he threw it to him, I caught that live.
I think this answer the question: will the cowboys choke?
Everyone is a Cardinals fan today :D
Happy the most overrated team lost to the Cardinals.   😅…. Great game from cardinals.  I can’t stand this team and their fan base.
To lose to a team who didn't even want to win, is a bad look!!!
booooooo
People make fun of the cardinals but they have heat if you’ve seen each game this season they could arguably been 3-0 without Kyler if they knew how to close up games
It’s always a joy to watch the Cowboys lose to a team they were supposed to handily beat. Great game Cardinals 🏈💪🏾💪
Fun game to watch.  Dallas lost to an inferior team.  Best part is Dak's interception finished the game.
It's the same every year they when 2 games and everyone says SUPER BOWL TEAMS then the next week they lose then its no more Superbowl I doubt they get to playoffs this year they mite when 8 or 9 games at the most but that's really pushing it I have been waiting for a Superbowl since 95 at it does not look like I will ever see another one there called Americas team but they should be called AMERICAS JOKE !!!
Upset of the Year already and it’s only week 3
LMAO AND THEY SAID 3-0 🤣🤣🤣
Humble pie served to the Cowboys 🤠 by the AZ Cardinals!  #AWESOME
I bet Tim’s angry lol
People love to throw shade at the cowboys  but yet we bring in the most money😂😂😂💲💲💲 facts
Like always cowboy fans get all over hyped and have to come back to earth. The curse started with Diggs going down and then a terrible loss to a bad team. As a life long cowboys fan, getting all hyped way to soon on brings bad things. Too many Dallas fans getting too excited leads to the usual cowboys under performing. Hopefully this loss takes alittle of the fantasy world away and can come back to reality.
Vale Madre Prescott deberian sacarlo es una verguenza😖😖😖😖
😂👀 Danny Dimes beat that team 🍵
Never understood why Lions and Broncos got rid of him???
Where demboys at
cowboys choking so early in the season lmao
Prescott aint it
In Skip Bayless words “HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS”
I’m so excited to see Dobbs as a starter. I wanted him to stay in Pittsburgh, still rooting for him now!
Hi! I...AM...NOW...A...BIG...CARDINALS FAN!!  Go Cards Go Cards Go Cards!! Pls do NOT get hurt, Mr. Dobbs! (Dobbs--where the hell did he come from??)  Oops, I think that mr. Murray has just lost his job--oh my!!
Cant understand how my teams fans arent used to this by now. Im 20 years old and ive only seen two playoff wins by the cowboys. Cmon guys what we expect this szn. Like cmon?
(As a cowboys fan) this game exposed my concerns of exactly what the issues for dallas are. Dak does not show up every game. Ill give the defense a break until next week where they have to prove if they are truly elite or not.
Good game, J Dobbs! VOL 4 LIFE! (And I'm a Joshua Dobbs fan for life) So happy to see you get the opportunity to lead your team to victory!  (And that's NO 💩!)
As an Eagles fan this was satisfying to see Zach Ertz and Arizona handle Dallas
Cowboy hype dead like the commanders hype
Remember when football players were MEN and didn't celebrate like little kids after EVERYTHING they do good.........
"Tank" these Nuts, Trolls!!!   - The Valley
Feels good to know we aren’t worse than the bears for sure 😂 we honestly played good all 3 weeks if we can keep this up on defense we should be good the rest our season for a team who’s been scoring 20+ and held them to just 16 that’s saying something 100% ! Go cards #birdgang
Good ol Dak Chockescott
Nothing better than a cowgirls loss.
Dobbs better get a chance to start as qb1 somewhere if kyler Murray gets healthy enough to play again. He is him.
The script is crazy this year
I honestly don’t have faith in us beating these next 2 teams, patriots then 49ers we gone be 2-3
Giants > Cowboys
The ugly history of the cowboys came to life yesterday, offside , interference,interception complete lack of discipline. This is not a coach-player problem it is a management problem, how many more years before management understands!!!
Double the pride, double the fall. So happy for Arizona. 😂
Wow the Cowboys downfall is starting earlier in the season than usual.  Usually happens after they play 3-5 games and start playing competition lmao
Cow fans should probably quit hoping for elite QB play out of Dakota and instead hope for solid game management. DAL offensive scheme clearly shows the staff does not trust him to put the team on his back.
just happy to see the cowgirls lose.
Good content thanks 😂
Where the heck is Micah???? Was he injured??? LOL
I like Dak.. I want him to do good.. but man he ain’t it smh he’s the only thing holding the Cowboys back smh I’m Packers all day but the Cowboys deserve much more.. that team is stacked 🤦🏽‍♂️ just bad QB play smh
As a Jints fan I say thank you AZ!
Cowboys defense is the reason why they're not going to win this year.
I was not expecting us the win but LETS GO!!
Rayne Dakota pleaseeeeeeeee throw the ball to men wearing the same uniform as you babe!
Gg cardinals
Cowboys Superbowl ? Bahaha ! Not with Dak
Great to see Josh Dobbs play well, today. That's called perseverance.  👍
Dobbs baby
Cuz Caleb Williams gonna stay another year with USC.
Im so tired of Dak. He is not consistent.  Weak and always will be....
Stop running man so much dallas hello
OK, NOW LETS PLZ LOSE THE REST OF THE GAMES OF THE SEASON NOW LOL. IM GOOD WITH JUST BEATING THE COWGIRLS!
Embarrassing!!! What else would we expect. Loser ORGANIZATION!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cowboys doing Cowboy things
nobody’s said it but this commentator really does have the best calls while the plays are happening.
This game looked like it was fixed for the Cardinals to win
The cowboys rally cry. "THERES ALWAYS NEXT YEAR"
we are so delusional to think dak can lead us to a super bowl. WE NEED A BETTER QB.
Yet, wack dak is getting paid like a top 5 qb.
So far biggest upset of the season  great moment if you’re a cardinals fan and it feels like they should be 3-0.
Is Dobbs this years Geno???
I cant believe we won lol
Nice read, Dak 🤣
That was a horrible interception in the endzone. The defense was in a zone coverage . They were literally 3 defenders in that area
Cowboys how is that field…?
Hi.  I am the only Cowboys fan that clicked on this video today.
0-2 beat 2-0
Tell me the league ain’t rigged without telling me it’s rigged?
For all cardinals fans, your welcome (I really thought we was gonna get blown out)
The Cards made my day, can't wait for week 5.
This win will Movtivate the Cardinals to the playoffs.
They still putting the league on notice?? 👀🤔😂🤣😭📴🤦🤷
Is this BABY still Asleep on the FACEBOOK PAGE?
Cowboys cant stop the run and Dak need i say more
Apparently the teams projected to be ‘tanking’ forgot their expected roles for 2023! Great job Dobbs and the Cards.
How about them cowboys!
Cowboys defense stayed on the bus 😂
For all who claimed the Cowboys could go undefeated. The Boyz are not perfect but the only NFL TEAM that was perfect was the 1972 Dolphins 17-0 to be Super Bowl Champion
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahah😂😂😂, Cowboys.
I’m so glad the Cow Puckys lost 😂 I just started seeing memes about them being undefeated so far and they certainly needed to be checked lol
Did anyone see the cardinals kicker miss that extra point on they last touchdown or I'm just seeing things
Cowboys 🤡
There's something strange that happens when the cards and cowboys play.  No matter how good the boys are,  they always struggle against the cardinals
Patriots defense has a chance to win this game
Ganon still helping the Eagles out even on another team! Got to love when the cowgirl's lose!
Cardinals play well against NFC East.
I went to UT the same time that Dobbs was QB, so good to see him finally breaking out for an NFL team
time to have a talk with Quinn & the Strength/conditioning department
When your O-line is down 3 starters against a decent D-line, it's not going to be good. This will be=ring them back down to earth and get them back to work.
Dak ain’t winning cowboys a Super Bowl
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵🥵🥵🥵Cardinals showed up to play !!!! Dallas dident expect that ! 😂😂😂😂
Vegas is the big winner today.
With Dak as QB the cowboys will never win anything. Dak never stops to disappoint and does always choke whenever it comes down to him. I am a Cowboys fan btw
Hey cowboys it ain’t playoff time yet :|
Even though my Skins got housed by Buffalo yesterday, at least we BEAT the Cardinals!!
Im glad the cardinals won what a breath of fresh air
The Arizona Cardinals coach didn't look too happy celebrating 🥳🥳🥳 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
as a cardinal fan expecting a Blowout i cant express how happy ima walk into work today
We will be alright
RISE UP RED SEAAAA
DAK PRESCOTT IS A OVERRATED FRONT RUNNING BUMB WHEN IT ACTUALLY CAME DOWN TO HIM LEADING THE TEAM TO A COMEBACK HE COULDNT DO IT DANIEL JONES BETTER THEN THIS BUMB
Cowboys fans 😂
Cardinals seemed more up for it, impressive
Brou and his "F game" take incoming! :D can't wait
came hear to see the legend "josh Doubs" the rattlesnake himself
dak prescott is the most overrated and overpaid athlete in the NFL...its amazing how year after year, people keep making the same mistake and think this is the year that Dak will prove himself to be elite. If someone is not elite after their first few years, they will never be elite.
Lamb overrated as Hell 😅 especially with a name like that mama need to be slapped
skip is dead !!
Even when we lose, the haters can't help but go out of their way to talk about Dallas. Comical. Living rent free in yall's heads forever! 😆
Dobbs is better than that midget they had playing QB last year.
They sure got the best defense in the league
Typical Cowboys 🤠...cant beat a tanking team
Why TF are you going for 2 at 9-0?
It looks like the Cowboys didn’t come ready to play overlooking their opponent they are not that good it’s very obvious
As a cowboys fan I'm glad that we got this loss early in the year, we always get over hyped, hopefully this will brings us back to reality and we can work to fix these weakness before we play real contenders, this is the first game this year that the run defense couldn't get it done, the red zone production is terrible and the long ball is getting us too often.  We had several injuries as well, Dak needs to run when he can, and trust his pass on man coverage and not throw into 3 defenders.   If Dak works have ran into the end zone on the interception late in the game he would have scored, it's like he doesn't see the whole field sometimes.  We'll be okay once we get back to healthy except for diggs, that we'll have to play around.
Lmao I like when any other team loses to an underdog you guys act like nothing, but Cowboys lose 1 game (really doesn't matter) you guys act like it's the end of the world for us. We are not stressing like you guys do when they win. Easy to say, wait until the playoffs because the percentage of going home and continuing season slims during postseason. Not a bright take just saying
Cowboys already in late season form 🔥
LMFAO GREAT GAME COWGIRLS!!! PHINS UP!!!!
Who is number 1?
This might be more embarrassing than the 70 spot put up on Denver.. we know what Miami is capable of… everyone was praising the cowgirls… what now???
What happened to Murrey
Dallas should never lose to Arizona. Lol
Keep Forcing the Ball Dak in Heavy Coverage .............We Love it
Still can't believe Dallas let Jada Smith and the Cardinals do that..
So proud of Dobbs!
NOT SURPRISED....DALLAS DOES THIS EVERY YEAR LIKE CLOCKWORK.........
I'll readily admit that the Cowboys live rent free in my head. I hate them so much, that I have designated 'Cowboy Money' every week (I bet on them to win every single week regardless of who they play). That way, even if they win - I'm good. Let's just say that this week I'll not be losing any sleep over my loss 😂
This is why nobody trusts the cowboys
Josh Dobbs looks like a NFL QB for sure
Have been a cardinals fan since Thursday way to go cards!!! 🤣
Jerry Jones will never win another Super Bowl for firing Jimmy Johnson after winning
Same old Cowboys. Lot of talk.
Bahahaha!
Love to see it
Pittsburgh released Dobbs and Connor, looks like that was a bad move since Pittsburgh needs both a QB and a good runningback
With Joshua Dobbs being this good idk if Kyler Murray will get his job back
my, but that was satisfying
Cowboys fan boys talking about how their team is the best in the NFL, but got beat by possibly the worst team. Losers!!! 🤣🤣🤣
'This year this team is different!' Jones for 25years in a row now...
This is sickening n disgraceful, cowboys are a joke, wont beat the patriots either
Dobbs > Duck  #CrashForCaleb
Phony cowboy haters..I know y'all love the cowboys more than your own pitiful teams🤷So keep the D in your mouths 😅DC4L👊💪
I just need to see week 3 power ranking now when all the sports analyst keep saying Dallas is the best nfl team now 🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽
Dem 🤡 boys a first round exit to the saints or lions on the road. Dak 2-4 in playoffs just like Romo 0-3 in the divisional round. And back to back loses to the 49ers and chargers before the week 7 bye 🔥
As a cowboys fan this is the team im used to seeing 😂😂
worst game i have ever seen such a shitty gamr
In first two games cowboys average gave up 5 pts per game. Opponents are afraid of passing and running. In this game boys gave up over 200 rushing yards. Just as stephen a smith predicts be patient just wait. Accidents are going to happen. When you have high expectations cowboys crush down like 1929 great depression. How about dem cowboys😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hate to be that guy but will, but when you got 3 offensive line men out the game I’d hope you win the game  Don’t get me started w diggs  But I like this loss it wakes up the cowboys and gets them focus hopefully they adjust from this
This is more like the cowboys I know
Those losses will cost you home field advantage cowgirls….. keep it up
Cowboys starting choking early this season  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. GO GIANTS 😎
How about them boys !!!!!
I don’t always pull for a team in the same division as my team, but when I do they are playing against the Cowboys.
I wonder how Skip Bayless and the rest sports analysis feel now talking about Dallas is the best team in the NFL lol. Cowgirls got exposed
Stephen A wya 😂
Ahh dak back to being Dak , the world makes sense again
Cardinals switched tanks with russia this week.
It wasnt just Dak and the offense. The Cardinals exposed the Cowboys on this game. Parsons is supposed to be an LB. He's acting like an Edge so what happens, it leads to huge runs. Recipe to beat Cowboys, run it to their throat. They only have 1 LB since Parsons is playinjg Edge instead of what his position is. Honestly, I will take Warner than this guy if its just LB position. Switch him to Edge and get another LB so they can stop the run. This weakness was masked because they met two NY teams who don't know how to run. As for the offense. It's bad and I mean really bad offense. A 3rd tier QB acting like a top 10. Pollard is the only player I'll trust on that offense. This team will get hammered if they meet Niners or Eagles. They are worst compared to last year.
I love them G-strings them cowgirls we're wearing it makes him look sexy, so now they can stop acting tough and be humble😂
I like Joshua Dobbs at QB
DALLAS NUNCA SERA CAMPEON MIENTRAS SIGA PRESCOTT !!!!
Pittsburgh West stand up!   Glas to see Connor and Dobbs making it do what it do .  Both players are also great character, people, met both while they were in PGH, very humble, chill, and genuinely nice guys.
Congratulations Cardinals. This is what makes the NFL so great upsets like this! Wow!
Alot of lowriders got to limp home after this game...I'll bet 1/3 there was wearing a Cowboys hat
Dallas's coach play calling sucksn the red zone Dak what U thinking of Damm
Man I wish I had this many ADs on my videos. Unreal and puke worthy, just like Dallas.
Dak hoescott will be the reason cowboys don't make it to the super bowl AGAIN
Dak “choke” Prescott  Go birds 🦅
Finally giving my boy Gallup some touches smh
Way to go Josh Dobbs! Always wanted to keep Dobbs over Rudolph but didn't pan out that way. Congrats Dobbs keep it up all season buddy!👋👋👋👋
Love cowboys
Dallas still STINKS!
Cardinals doing a terrible job of trying to draft Caleb Williams.
Great game by the Cardinals!
“There’s a black cat runnin around that franchise.” 🎶🎵
Dont think the term the commentator used to describe RondelMoore was appropriate , "jitter bug."
Cardinals could’ve easily been 3-0 don’t sleep on them
🎵 THE GIRLS ARE BACK IN TOWN 🎵  They started the game looking like sulking children, I couldn’t understand it. Parsons looked like someone stole his ice cream. Very odd.
I see "Cheaty" Lamb still gets away with pushing off.
Dobbs played years under Big Ben 👍 + James Connor  Way to go Cards!  🔶♦️🔷 🖤💛🤍🖤💛🤍🖤💛🤍
DoneWithDak. Mr Pick returns to form.
Remember a week ago when cowgirl fans thought they were gonna win the Super Bowl 😂😂
One of the greatest heist in NFL history.: Dak Prescott's contract holdout. They should have let his assx go back then.
@3:41 The old white announcer calls Rondale Moore a jitterbug, apparently completely unaware that, he just used a racial slur on live tv...
Dallas getting to the red zone and failing to score--big problem.  Happened last week, escaped with a win. This week, a loss.  Need to work on getting the ball into the endzone for 6.  Dallas you are not elite if you keep on settling for three's.  Belichick's defense next week is going to feast on you. You are looking at going into week 5 2-2.
If Cardinals wanted to tank they should've hired Kwesi as GM. Hes doing an amazing job at destroying the Vikings.
Dak constantly throwing terrible picks and the media jabronis constantly hailing him as a top tier QB😂😂😂😂😂
Cowboys doing cowboy things. You played nobodies and thought yall were good
Can’t wait for Stephen A’s Reaction 😂
Dallas hasn't been tested, at all, in two games. Um,.. this game wasn't supposed to test them either. I laughed the whole way through 😅
Stephen A bout to have a hell of a time with this one
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They need to run the ball in the red zone.  That's how they scored the TD.  Then they forgot they had a running back.  They weren't ready for this game, coach.
Losing Treveon Diggs was the single worse thing that could’ve happened to the Cowboys. More than if they had lost Dak Prescott. Their season is over
Cowboys 🤠 Being Cowboys 😂😂😂never ever change Cowboys fans😂😂😂😂 #Steelers #Fan
Giants fan, just here enjoying the comments 😎
Dak needs to go..   7 straight field goals last week.. 4 this week.. that's because the QB can't get his team in the end zone.. The kicker needs to ice his kicking leg..
A cowboys loss.....is always a good loss!  "America's team!" 😂😂😂
AaahahahahhahahhHhhHahahhahHAaahahah!! !!!  Go Eagles!!
id rather have josh dobbs than kirk cousins.. there i said it
You will NEVR win anything with Dak Prescott as your QB... EVERR
All I gotta say is JAMES CONNER. He’s the main reason the Cards won this game (along with my Cowboys defense allowing him to have this great game). Everytime the Cowboys was about to get a stop, he showed up either with strong running or receiving. He allowed the Cardinals to open up their offense and embarrassingly my Cowboys didn’t know how to respond 🤦‍♂️. We went two weeks looking dominant just to end up getting embarrassed by one of the worst teams in the league 😡🤬
Looks like the Cowboys are tanking now 😂
Hahahahahahahah
Dak is clearly Romo 2.0, he chokes when the game  is on the line. The defense couldn't stop the run at all this game, and the passing game clearly was hurting missing Diggs, so it was tiem for the 40 million dollar man Dak prescott to step up and carry the team.  He choked, 0 excuses. he is a subpar QB considering hsi salary cap hit, and McCarthy going for it on 4th and goal was beyond stupid, adding more pressure to a QB that folds under it.
I know this team didnt look the same without Diggs
Overrated every year. Cowboys ,you need a quarterback.
What an exciting team, playing with heart and lots of effort, great job cardinals. Cowboys choke, lmao
Dak ain't him.
Same old Dak prescott.
National Embarrassment Cowgirls 😂😂🇺🇸
Wow the Cardinals actually have a head coach?! And a QB?
If they had Diggs would've been a closer game
All McCarthy had to do is keep running the ball. Run game gets you down the field and you throw it every down in the red zone
YIKES now everyone can stop the Dallas hype train
It’s great day when Dallas Cowgirls lose!! Bwahahahaha 😂
So Cowboys are still the best team in the league, with all-time best defense? Or are they not anymore? I'm confused. Cowboys fans explain it to me 🙏
Thanks for the love yall we needed this game
Those who bet on the cardinals may have made a lot of money !
When all the analysts say they would choose Dak over purdy bahahaha 🤡s 😂
I cnt wait for first take on Monday..I've been waiting on this since the season started lmfao 😂😆
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 laughing in 49er 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As long as youre not seachicken, foulsmelling raven or rotten cheeseheads, as a fortyniner fan, i got respect for ya. Be it Red Sea or Cowboys I respect rivalry game will recognize game. 🏈🤝✊🏼
COWGIRLS BACK ATTTT IT AGAIN🤣 AZ?!?!
I don't think I've ever seen a QB throw the ball into triple coverage this many times in a single game
Wow, the Cardinals were great.  The Cowboys need some serious work to reach the level of the Cardinals.  Like commenter before me, I think the Cardinals are the team to beat.
🎉🎉🎉NINERS FAN HERE AND SHOUTOUT TO BOTH RED SEA AND JERRY JONES AND THE COWBOYS - GREAT WEEKEND BUT WATCH OUT WEEK FOUR AND WEEK FIVE YOU WILL FACE YOUR RECKONING AGAINST THE RED AND GOLD FORTY NINERS EMPIRE 😈😈😈
Most normal Cowboys perfomance
As a cowboys fan, congrats to the cardinals - josh dobbs what a story for him
Dak Prescott has the talent of a good backup quarterback.  Jerry Jones does not like to make changes but it's time.  Get rid of Dak, get Colt McCoy in and draft a better QB later.  Cooper Rush and Colt McCoy can get it done for now.  Cut Dak as soon as possible.
Even though I don’t like both teams I couldn’t stop making fun of the cowgirls. Y’all are a joke
Always a good day when Dallas chokes 😂😂😂
Dak presshit
I really wanna see how Skip and Michael Irvin are going to try and justify this on tomorrows show
What a game by the cardinals that’s how you play football and they ran that clock the whole game and moved them sticks and made sure they put up 3 everytime
HOW 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
😂😂😂😂 how about them cowboys 😂😂😂😂
Was Jerry and his minions at the game ? They usually show him on camera when he’s present.
GREAT JOB ALL...THANX 4 MAKING  Tee with    LIONS NAMED LEO   the  music    worldwide. LOVE YOU ALL...!!!....MUCH LOVE.!!
Amazing how some Cowboys fans trashed the 49ers for "winning" a game agains the Giants saying oh we beat them 40-0 and you all only scored 30 and they got 12 on you. Yet are quiet when they get beat by a team that the Giants came from behind and beat.
Can you imagine the day in February when the CARDS win a super bowl, the world will end 😅😂, but it will be bad asz though😅.
slightly altered power rankings I assume. Dolphins baby
Looks like the Cardinals took the bus to state farm stadium
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that the Cowboys have won a Super Bowl more recently than the 49ers
Nombre cowboys, oh well we will get our get back
They won the SB #7 I want to see that same energy  next 7 games cuz I didn't  see it the 1st 2 weeks y'all lost Cardinals  every team plays their SB best against the Cowboys but same energy not 4 the rest of the league
Cowboys finally played a  tough team get used to it.😂😂😂😂
As a Commanders fan this makes me happy
Stephen A. Smith is laughing about the Cowboys. First Take with some grits-n-gravy 😂😂
But my cardinals have the worst roster in the league yeah ight I hope the league keeps thinking that lol we still don’t have our starting qb and could easily be 3-0 rn lmfaooooooo
How bout them Cardinals
& we got Bryce Young 🤨
Wtf 2 ads
Im a Cowboys Fan but AZ is BRINGING FOR WHAT ALL IT SHOWED US THAT U AN OTHER TEAM'S THAT SIDE ONLY THROW ONE SIDE  just a mixed Bag O-line No Zack Martin Dak was not protected most of the time it's mostly running around scrambling games when your quarterback isn't being protected for the mixed bag of a OLine is not going to win Games. And don't forget you know it's kind of funny how the Seahawks again injured a rookie before he can even play the National Football League we took the L whether have players of OURS  Rest for later down the line
Hahahaha
Dobbs > Dak. Danm!
It's time to let Dak and Mike walk Jerry said Dak will be a Cowboy for life gee I hope not because he definitely doesn't deserve it how you over throw Cooks on a slant it was a game changer
I think the cowboys came into the game way too confidently and forgot they were in the NFL. As a cowboy fan I hope this brought them down to earth. Good game Cardinals y'all deserved this one.
Sehr guten 😂
Dak couldnt throw a pass in the redzone even if his life depended on it. Lamb doesnt doesnt run his routes. Pollard running the ball is so predictable it just wont go… Dak throwing the ball into 3 players oh man. yet i cant decide if its dak that cant throw or find the open man or if its the wr that cant get open. Do we even have a TE???
I though they had the best defense in the nfl?😂
Pollard isn't a who they think he is. No good LBs (Vander esch is cheeks.) WRS give up on routes. Kearse is a fraud.  Mazi Smith is a Bust. TEs are mediocre at best.
Always a good day when the cowboys lose
Someone check on Scooter Macgruter😂😂😂😂😂
UNREAL. Cowboys got defeated by the Underrated Cardinals.
This Cowboys defense really IS on par with the '85 Bears. Of course, most of those guys are in their sixties so yeah . . . yeah!
Prescott gotta go.  He is definitely the weak link.
The hurt & feeling my world collapsed after the Bills mauling, God saw fit to brighten my day.
That’s the most surprising game that I’ve ever seen. Wow. What a game by Cardinals. 👍👍
Its always a good day when the cowboys lose 😂
Cowboys super bowl hype has died week 3
Anygiven sunday  😂you never kno how a team my come out and play 😅
Jets fan here. When all the cowboys fans were overhyped beating us last week our household said “let’s see them play a half decent team and they’ll lose”.  Not going to lie because it’s sad to say it with the current state of my team but you all losing to the cardinals of all teams was deserved.   We’ll see ya’ll in  tumbleweed city by the end of the season. Send your boy Dak with a beer when you get here.
Playoffs mode for Dallas already 😂
As a 49ers fan, good game by Arizona. I’ve been saying since last year, the Cowboys run defense is weak. Arizona I believed rushed for over 200 yards. Plus, the Cowboys offense has not looked too good, so far. The whole NFC West is going to be a dog fight. Arizona not going to lay down, they’ll fight each week
Dak has a problem throwing RedZone touchdowns. He just struggles with RedZone touchdowns that's his problem
As the saying goes, "The Cowboys are who we thought they are".
Ahh here they are the haters out of the woods
Dobbs good jod
Just here for the comments
How bout them cowboys.
same Old Dak...same old Dallas🤣😂
Cardinals had Parsons crawling back to the locker room after that loss. 😂
*Dallas needs to keep injuring players in practice...*  Seems to be working out well.
America's Team got robbed today. 😭
Nfl is rigged
Cardinals put the Cowboys on their heels 😂
cowboys haters when the cowboys dont go 16-0 :  lmao like this is a significant loss or something.
Dak Prescott continues to be the problem for thr Cowboys when they face REAL DEFENSES ! He had to Settle for 3 Field Goals and threw a Crucial Interception in the End Zone ! As Dak goes , so goes the Cowboys. It's really that simple.
Dallas are a bunch off over rated pricks .    Up the lions !!
Two weeks ago, the Cowboys won the SUPERBOWL.
God....I love watching Jerry's team lose.
“It’s just the Cardinals”
Dak and Parsons are overrated, sorry cowboy fans but this team wont win a SB with Dak leading the offense
HOWBOYS GOT EXPOSED MEANING HOW DID THEY GET TO 2-0 LOL
Ummm, where are all you Cowgirl losers at?  You were all over YouTube last week.  Dobbs??  LoL y'all are frauds. 🦅 Fly EAGLES Fly!
Cowgirls getting gashed on the ground. They ain't beating the 49ers like that.
Stephan A And Shannon Sharpe finna have A Field Day tomorrow 😂😂😂😂 🤣 🤣 🤣
Finally Cardinals didn´t throw they lead. He looked good in every match this year but everytime they stopped playing in 3 or 4 quarter.
Cowboys fans acting like they never lose. You should be used to that by now
Wow the Cowboys are showcasing playoffs performance quite early this season. 😂
Let's bust 100% of bets. How? Watch.
Not even December yet and Cowboys already breaking fans hearts.
Cards good game. As a Dallas fan to many red zone mistakes. Clean that up we would have one easily. Cardinals executed, Dallas didn’t, that simple.
Now the drama is on in jerryworld.
The Dallas Chockers Club
Go Niners!!! 🏈
"how bout them Cowboys" how do you loose to a team who are "tanking"?
Good for you Cardinals for punching the Cowgirls in the mouth
Glad the Tweety Birds/Woodpeckers won this one. If they can beat the Cowboys, so can the Chargers.
Nobody thought the Cowboys were the best team in the NFL apart from deluded Cowboy fans lol
Ll
Cowboys?! ... Exposed much?? 😂
Can’t take the cards too lightly... as a Niner fan I was happy , but ok chess not checkers... time to hit the film room!
The loss of Diggs has this team depressed. Still no excuse to lose to Ari
I actually thought before the season started that Arizona was going to win 0 games but here we are....
Lots of penalties for Cowboy's
How bout them cowboys?😂
sacks    picks    looks like the girls are starting to come apart early this yr.
Pretty apparent cardinals don’t need murray
TAKE A BOW WOW
This is a perfect reminder that no matter how bad you think a team is you NEVER let up. Keep your head down, play till the whistle and always leave your all on the field. Hope this humbles all you smack talkers, fans of any team ✌🏽
If I’m the eagles or Niners I run the ball down their throats , cowboys have a flaw that was exposed today. 🙏🏼
They stopped running the ball, smh inside the redzone and you don't rely on your oline to pick up 10 yards...the cards secondary balled out btw ...Diggs not being there is huge for Dallas but that wasn't the reason they didn't score more points, van der esch was getting outran too ,congrats cards
Cowboys lose one defensive player(albeit one of the best) and suddenly the games "best defense" implodes...huh
How bout them cowboys!!!! 😂🤣 skip gonna be mad tomorrow
Molly: the dolphins put up 70 points against the broncos defense. Stephen A whats your reaction?  Stephen a smith: we do not care the cowboys 🤠 lost to the cardinals and i got my 10 gallon hat with my cigar and the cowboys prove once again that we can't trust them at their highest moment. HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA😂 I SAW THIS COMING FROM A MILE AWAY
Well, the cards at least gave me a hell of a joy this season  Cowboys please, never change 🥳
The cardinals really had that fire in their gut
When will Jerry Jones give up on Dak
Na son cardinals coach first win was against billionaire dollar team . With third string qb 🤦🏽‍♂️
Dak throws a pick and loses the game, what a shock
Jonathan Gannon gonna make the cardinals a problem
S Gilmore got outplayed today. Used to be an elite corner. Is he in decline?
what about dem booooois
🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
The more i watch football now a days, the more i think its all a scam and see teams throwing games for benefit of league. started with bills against jets, dallas to cardinals, raiders too steelers, jags to texans. find it really predictable and not so much entertaining anymore..
How about them Cowgirls? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
JUST BRING IN THE KID TREY
IMAGINE LOSING VS THE CARDINALS LOL
If only Romo had any of Dak’s teams. What could have been. What you get Jera for kicking Romo to the curb. Karma. Jera ran Jimmy- Karma, Jera throws Romo under the bus -Karma. That man better just sell the team. I have been an ex cowboy fan after Romo’s last TD pass in his final game (only drive) against Philly
AZ should be 3-0. Still, although Arizona has won 7 of their last 8 games vs Dallas, beating them will never get old.
Dak will never be that guy😢
Nice upset. I love it when Dallas gets BEAT.
Thus is exactly why I’ve been saying the cowboys are still the same
So mad we lost but put up a good fight
Nah put some respect on the cardinals kicker tho 🔥
fraudulent cowboys. as every year
They do it every year. They won a few games and they listen to all the Monday morning quarterbacks that they are the best team and theyre going to win the superbowl. Then they lose to a weaker team. Its been happening for 20 years. The whole team should not be allowed to watch any media or internet during the week. Now everyones going to say their done. They dont have it. Its hard being a Cowboy fan. Im not taking anything away from Arizona. They played better.
Mfs always wanna play they hardest against us lol
That redzone pick to lose the game was so absolutely typical "Dak," it almost felt scripted. His game losing picks are his brand like Bradys comebacks
Nice to see the cards humble the cowboys 😎
😂😂😂😂😂
how is cowboys gonna be ready for the playoff if they lost by 0-2 team lol
Dak Prescott is doing it again. Give it back Dak.🏈
This cardinals team is playing with a fire in their gut.
How about them Cowboys 💩💩💩 On the nose or what. BTW Jerry you've been Daked again.
haha...haha...haha dem Boyz 😂😂
Told ya Diggs was the DPoY this year.
The Packers haven’t had Elton Jenkins or David Bakhtiari, and came back down 17 against a good Saints defense. What’s the Cowboys excuse? serious question for you cowboys fans did they just get out-coached?
Cardinals you saved my horrible shitty weekend!!!
lmao...the team with the most annoying fan base loses to the cardinals. The Arizona Cardinals. 🤣🤣
How bout them Cowboys!!! Too funny
Dallas was paid to lose this game just think about it 😮
LOL😂
How BOUT them cowboys?!
I salute  theh card shutvyakk still fsil to remember    it anygiven sunday cowboys lost yesh but it football.
Colorado & Cowboys lost this weekend America looking sad 😂
Love to see it Josh Dobbs!
Can Michael Irvin and Skip Bayless stop with this nonsense now about the Cowboys being the NFL's best team? I doubt if they will.
And now my Broncos are officially the worst team in the NFL. Go Cards.
refs and commentators dic ridin😂
Skip Bayless is gonna be pissed!
If kyler was healthy you could honestly say my cardinals would be 3-0
Taysom Hill is the most overrated player in the NFL. 'Hes special, he's so great'. Yea, thats why the Saints didn't make him their QB, and thats why he's only brought in for 'special plays'.
Real true cowboy giants redskins & eagles fans know it’s a division game when playing da cardinals…can’t complain about nothing tho good win cardinals💪🏾
Remember when everyone was saying both the 49ers and the Cowboys were going to meet as undefeated teams? Yeah, nope.
For the first time in a long time, I cannot wait for undisputed tomorrow 😂
That’s hurt 😩
Classic cowboys, game on the line throw into triple coverage in the end zone to effectively end the game lmao
Gonna love Skip Bayless and Michael Irwin talk about this game tomorrow morning.
Cowboys have been aggressively exposed
So happy for Dobbs. This made me so happy.
The Cardinals are limited talent wise. But they have been playing hard for their new coach. Huge props for bouncing back after that comeback loss to the Giants. Think Dallas were over confident coming into this game. But any given Sunday anyone can get beat!💯
Dak is always going to DAK 😂😂
I was telling people it was gonna be a good game I said let Arizona run game come together. Whoever had them on they ticket congratulations
This is the sharpest I've seen the Cardinals in a long time
Dak Prescott with his best Tony Romo impression throwing a pick when the game needs him the most
I had a feeling gannon was going to get his troops ready for dallas and beat em cardinals are looking tuff
God i hope we keep Dobbs as starter. Murray is too skiddish amd impatient. This guy is clicking with his receivers like Murray never has
Dak gotta go
Ohhhh gosh this is gold can’t wait til tomorrow morning SAS will have a field day. Imagine being the first team the cardinals beat lol.
A great win for my beloved cardinals, we was at boots in the park tempe az, blake shelton a true cardinals fan said he loves arizona & cardinals, we got an awesome win!! Arizona Country Strong!!
As an Eagles fan, thank you cardinals.
So McCarthy is the problem. Got it. If this season doesnt work out hes gone. Hes the only common denominator between this year and last year for the losses. He cannot playcall a single redzone to save his life.
I do not like either team but it is funny how the announcers wanted the cowboys to win.....😆😆😆😆
Congratulations AZ CARDINALS, GO BIG RED!!!!!!
i dont get the 2p-try in the first quater. just take the point and extend the lead.
A cowboys loss is more satisfying than an Eagles win 😌
I mean...at least they didn't put 70 up on us...let's gooooo Cowboys!!
As a niners fan I’m so glad that the cardinals won
Wait... Are the Cardinals not going 0-17
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS!😂
Stephen A is about to have a field day on First Take 😂😂
sack dak.... he's the problem for the cowboys.
Steelers win, Dobbs beats the girls. You love to see it. YOU DESERVE THE PRAISE JOSH! AND YOU DESERVE THE LOVE TO JAMES! We love you both.
Cowboys theme song: The wheels on the bus go round and round…. and then fall off!!!!
Almost as satisfying as seeing lebrons lakers lose
mccarthy not good..2 ok receivers..overrated oline..bad defense. And cenile owner
Thank you Cardinals for shutting down this ridiculous cowgirl hype train for at least a week
DAK NO GOOD
Im a cardinals fan and struggling to see how the cowboys lost
This game that Cowboy's played made the Cardinals look like a good team. 🤬
Coming from an Eagles fan and Gannon hater, he’s got these boys playing man.
When Dallas looked invincible they crumble down .
WHAT THE "FUNK" WAS ALL THAT PLAY CALLING BY DALLAS COWBOY'S HEADCOACH! F'N...F'N RETARDED!!
Huh, who knew Jada Pinket Smith move the ball like that?
America’s team has me looking for my passport 👀
On parsons sack, 54bwas offsides
If you want to crown Dobbs buttski, go ahead!! He deserves it!  🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈
As a Cowboys fan, "where them boys at?"  That was talking bad about Trevon, forgetting in Dak's face this past office season.
The perfect football weekend! Dallas loses and the 49ers win! Woot-Woot!!
Daks going downhill from here.
I think the first play said it all
When cowgirls lose, America wins☺ Thank you Cardinals! And I hope Dobbs, Connor and Brown continue their spectacular performances!!
I'll bet when Dallas fans looked at the schedule this year they pretty much chalked this up  as an easy win ....that's why they play the game
If Dak Prescott can't beat the Cardinals they ain't them boys😆
The Cardinals ran the ball straight at the strength of Dallas and they ran good! Teams should do the same thing Parsons is good but he is not unblockeable, the Cardinals out played Dallas give them credit!!!!!
Cowboys are always an S-Tier regarded B-Tier team. They cannot be consistent and cannot win big games.
NO ONE BELIEVED IN US, GOD DID 🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥‼️‼️‼️‼️
All them ex birds know what it is and my heart as philly fan is warm rn all our division foes caught L… we get chance tomorrow to go up 1… always have love for cards they are like able franchise besides Gannon he was bout to choke again but Dak Choked first and I most definitely approve
Sports talk should be all about how the Cardinals are the best team in the NFC after this win.
Wtf was Dak looking at on that pick. It was triple coverage,  and would've been picked by two other cards before the wr had a chance to touch it. 😅 Dak is Done
Cowboys already in playoff form 😤
Prescott benefited his first 2 games by his defense playing bad, injured teams so he didnt need to do much. Once that defense got exposed,  we seen what happens when Dak needs to win a game with his arm. Cowboys are frauds on both sides of the ball. If Arizona didn't expose them, the 49ers would have
This makes the Giants comeback last week even sweeter, everyone said the cards lost that on purpose.
Everyone plays well against the Cowboys… sad to say.. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️…
Pain  But I respect the Cardinals for this win. Enjoy it,y’all don’t get much of these.
RIGGED
Eagles gonna have a field day running the ball on these guys. Cowboys run defense got exposed
Now this was cowboy football 😎🤙.
How 'bout them Cowboys!
Cowboys will be the Cowboys lol. Not every defense can be elite like the 49ers and Browns who have the best defensive player on the planet.
Wild
As a 49er fan this does my heart good. Every year the cowgirls play Carlie Brown to the football god's Lucy.
Everybody said Dak would outplay his opposition
Dallas never disappoints ! How bout them Cowboys
28 years and counting my lord this hype on   The cowchokes was ridiculous🤡🤦🏼‍♂️
Cardinals unlock the Cowboys in handling a first loss, Cardinals alert ball control on the ground and defence coming up red zone stops enable first W game highlights......👋
Typical prescott game, when he needs to deliver he simply doesnt.
I can’t wait for UNDISPUTED tomorrow 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thank God they lost ... F the cowboys!
Yeah. Cowoys are gona win the SB. lol
Niners are gonna chew both of these teams up in the next 2 weeks.
Cowboys already in  playoff mode
Lmaooo hit the wall early this year. Dallas will never be a contender. Ever since a salary cap existed they’ve been a joke. The team doesn’t know how to build anything period without free money. This was pathetic lmao
They're who we thought they were 😂
Trey Lance … he’s on the team.
Ok, first of all, Dallas according to lots of people are no longer America's team, that title belongs to the Kansas City Chiefs, so all you bitter cowboy fans, accept this, and get over it.
This really settles how the cowboys match up to teams that aren’t from New York 😂😂
The cowboys never dissapoints every year to shut their fans up 😂
😂😂😂😂😂🤠🤠🤠🤠
For a team the so-called analyst said was tanking. They fight every single week. They could easily be 3-0
😅😅😅😅
RIGGED
Gannon got that dawg in him from Philly
Good job today Arizona cardinals. I'm no cardinals fan at all but I'm glad they got their first win today. As a niners fan when the cowboys lose it's always a good sunday for sure.
So much for all those fools claiming the Cardinals are "Tanking" this year.
Does the crawling me they are dogs?
8:08 Cowboys lost the game on this play. Should have kicked the field goal.
Remainder !!!!! many NFL commentators said ,cowboys defense was going to stop DOLPHINS !!!!!   HAHAHAHJAJAHAJAJAJAJAHHAH😂
Dak again show low QB IQ, Time to bring in Dak replacement 😲💥😭☠️
Too many ads
Dobbs and Conner. Good to see Steelers West win one against the ‘boys.
Dallas never disappoints. Dak never fails. :)
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS
Josh Dobbs was tearing us up in the Wild Card last year in Jax. Dude can ball!
Where Dem Boys at now?
Cowboys always find away to lose 😂.Stephen A bout to have a ball on this one
🥳 mr dobbs just put himself on tha map... excellent game... wow... 🥳 〽️🌜🎷🥳🥳🥳
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that John urschel has a PhD in mathematics   😊😮
Lol
I was at work and I finally checked my phone and yelled out loud “how tf are the cowboys losing by double digits” today was crazy 😂
Daaakkkk why would  you pass it lol everyone knew he was going to pass ...that is a nono in the fourth quarter😂
The cardinals could easily be 3-0 too
As a Steelers fan very happy for Josh and James.
First Take is gonna be a SHOW today! 😂😂😂 Cowboys gonna Cowboy. Best team in the NFL HUH???
Cowboys sucked. But I also gotta give credit to the Cardinals, they really did deserve to win.
Cowboys fans take note. Just cause you can beat down on a mediocre team doesn't mean you are going to the superbowl
As a cowboys fan the offense was okay just couldn't score in the redzone in the defense need to improve going forward
Dallas sketchy run defense shows itself
10:45-10:47 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂omguuudddnnneesss  Dak doin Dak things😊
Silly cowboys
Where all the Dallas fangirls at 😂😂😂😂
Prescott is the best backup quarterback in the league.
Someone forgot to tell the Cardinals they were tanking for Caleb Williams. And once again as soon as Dallas looks like a top team, they show us they can lose the most unlikely games with ease.
Good game, Cardinals!👏👏👏
Dak/Romo fans need to STFU! It's not the teams job to make the QB look good, it's the QBs job to make the team look good! They both are 2 playoff win QBs, nothing more!
Realistic Cowboys fan here. Jerry Curse is real, almost three decades of nothing to show for it.
i like josh dobbs, he isnt flashy or a stat monster, but he doesn't turn the ball over and is competent. He also doesn't really have any weapons.
Is Kyler Murray injured or something
Saw more ads than highlights… it’s a bit much youtube
We cut elliot and we should cut his buddy prescott togheter with that coach! Another shitty years is coming , we have been dominated by a modest team like the cardinals!
Thank you Cardinals for humbling the Cowboys.
Gilmore got exposed
Cowboys do cowboys things and lose to winless teams
Steelers backups played well
Watching the cowboys lose this game felt so good.
This YouTube video had 10 unskippable commercials. 10! Talk about any given Sunday! Gotta love the 32nd ranked power team taking it to the “1.” We’ll see what Arizona can really do next week when the Niners come to play.
Never understood why Josh Dobbs and James Conner had to leave Pittsburgh
Rondale Moore made Vander Esch look like an old man
Vegas is the real winner...I think the Cardinals were TANKING till they Realized that they are too GOOD!🤡
Congrats cards. From a lifelong cowboy fan. Im not hiding. I enjoy when they win and hate when they lose but you were better today.
Ooooooh this is great😂😂😂😂😂 that top notch Dallas defense that hasn't played anyone GOT EXPOSED.
As someone who eats breakfast for dinner and  dinner as lunch at there dad house. This is what a great game.
I still can’t believe Dallas lost. This season has been wild so far
Dobbs gon take Kyler job
I was shocked the Cowboys were able to make this some what close
How bout them Cowgirls .....................................
I thought the Cowboys would lose to the Birds, but not these Birds.  I either underestimated the Cards or overestimated the Cowboys.
Cardinals should be 3-0. They'll have a positive point-diff after tonight. Not bad for a team that's tanking.
Haters gonna hate, we still dem boyz
LOL
Just be patient  - Stephen A. Smith
When you're 2-0 playing a 0-2 team what do you do? You don't show up.
Great job, Cardinals!
America wins!
HAHA This is the Cowboys year! Not so fast not so fast. Well done Cardinals.
JIST TRADE DAK
Any other team gets 1 loss no one cares… but the cowboys get their first in week 3 and everyone loses their minds 💀
I freaking love when my team chokes; wouldn’t make me a true cowboy fan if I didn’t
Cowboys fans the most vocal. Where they at though?
Trade Murray!
Get your nasty cowboy carcasses outta my beautiful state of AZ😂
I was hyped up watching the Cowboys lose. I will always tune in for that.
As per usual
This was an EXCELLENT game if you’re a Cards fan. They played with intensity the whole way through and didn’t collapse. Best of all, it was the Cowboys they beat!
Cowboys lol Cowboys lol
FRAUDS!!
Bunch of Cowboys hater in the comments bruh 😂
I don't just say this as an Eagles fan, but this take this w/a barrel of salt if you will Dallas fans, but Prescott is not your guy. I know most of  you guys hopefully know that, but the only team atm in the league where the QB may not matter is the 49ers. I don't see your SB drought ending under this guy, he's just not a Hurts, Mahommes, etc.
They lost Diggs and said okay seasons over
Get rid of Dak Pescott, Cowboys, and play that kid Cooper Rush.
James Connor is a tank
As a eagles fan gotta luv this dark Prescott never dissapoints apprising teams haaaa
Everytime someone says the cardinals are the worst team i cringe. They literally couldnt be more wrong. Theyre a great team but their discipline is lacking
No! Cowboys are showing their colours too early. I was hoping bout week 8/9 we would get an inkling lol Stephen A bout to have a field day
Is marquise brown worth starting next week cuz Williams is injured
Any given Sunday... the NFL is so unpredictable. That's why I love this league. I feel a little better as a Washington fan even tho we played sloppy today. At least we beat Arizona 😌
Do Arizona fans not go to games lol that Cowgirls fan noise was insane
Kyler Murray is gonna lose his job to dobbs
Wait, didn't the media already crowned the Cowgirls last week?  Guess they are still the old cowgirls from last year.
Not bad for "the worst team in the NFL who is tanking" huh?
Dak doing Dak thing's...SMGDH
Heh heh heh heh 😊 HEH HEH HEHEHE HEH!😆
HOW About THEM COWBOYS !!!🤡🤣🤣🤣🤣
Just checkin in to see if y’all still…..we’ll you get it lololol
Any time the cowboys LOSE. IT'S A GOOD THING
Not having Diggs hurt
Every team in the NFL has a back up QB better than Dak Prescott! Including the Cowboys….
Boys fans been clowning eagles defense lately, we’re missing a couple of defensive starters. Cowboys lose one guy and this happens 😂
I'm glad to have missed this game. Could have wasted 3 hours. I was looking up the game, saw the score I'm like" Are you serious? We're starting again?"
Terry Bradshaw and etc were telling everyone that Dallas defense was definitely going to get this win. Well the Cardinals said the hell with that and took it too them.
AZ came into this game with a plan.
Cowboys lose games they supposed to win, it’s tradition 🤠
Bravo, Cardinals!!
And once again, all Cowboys fans are reminded how limited Dak Prescott is. Dude can’t throw a ball accurately past 15 yds!   Everybody will blame the play calling and ignore that the play calling has strict limits bc the qb can’t look off the #1 option or throw accurately past 15-20 yds!  Most overrated player in the history of the NFL!
Happy to see Connor and Dobbs do good as a Steelers fan
Dak will always be dak
Man we miss kyzir white thanks as a former eagle buddy we miss you thanks for picking off dak 🤣🤣
Dak coming in clutch
Josh Dobbs is for real! I knew it!
Joshua Dobbs maybe the new Q.B. 😂 Murray might be in trouble! 😂
Browns fan. Dobbs is good. So happy for him.
I told y’all Dak isn’t the answer he isn’t consistent enough.
Commercials are heavy. Cardinals QB is better than Fields & Jones
Hopefully just a bad game where we were unprepared. I would not bet against Dallas.  They will get back to where they were on D for sure. Our red zone offense sucked thanks to Dak.
Cowboys haters think about the cowboys more than us fans do. It’s hilarious. I’m not worried about this L we got a long season ahead of us still. DC4L. Y’all can never say we aren’t loyal
Nothin like watching the cowboys lose
Stephen A Smith and Sharpe are gonna have a field today Monday morning 🤣🤣!!
Nothing sweeter than watching Jerry's Kids lose one they were supposed to win handily. Congrats to Josh Dobbs on his first NFL win as a starting QB. He's a great story. WTG, Cards!
DON'T come into OUR house anymore thinking you're watching an easy win. All the visiting fans gonna find out soon we're taking our stadium back.
So much for McCarthy's offense huh. Its not like the Cardinals defense are crazy either. What is even crazy is how do the Cowboys front seven let the Cards run for over 200 yards?
Cardinals red zone defense absolutely shut down the cowboys.
How many have seen this movie already? Dallas needs a huge game from a certain QB.. That certain QB throws a pick?  I have seen it again and again... 🤭🤭 Yet, Dallas is a SB team last 3 seasons? I should have been a commentator...
This team is allergic to expectations. The choke every time. F game.
Rent free like every season! Nothing else to do but watch the Boyz
I can't wait to see skip Bayless face😂😂😂
They dem boyz
At this point the cardinals are definitely better than the Rams 😂 iykyk
"F game!!!" yelled Chris Broussard. I guess there ain't no tanking in the Cardio room.
Biggest upset in the last 3 years never saw this one coming if anyone says they did they are lying after the 1st 2 weeks I thought they were the best team in the league and I’m a Steelers fan and hate The Cowboys I didn’t think anyone would beat them except maybe the 49ers
So much for “ dem boyz”….
Refs were favoring the cardinals the entire game
Prescott needs to be traded IDC
Gatorade baths in week 3.  All because they beat the Cowboys lol.  Go ahead and laugh now.  Yuck it up
Once again another OVERRATED Cowboys team
How about them cowboys
LMFAO the best team in the NFL huh? Would you look at that. Totally showed that 0-2 team.
How bout those Cowgals?!?! 😂😅😂
hOw AbOuT tHeM cOwBoYs
Brock Purdy > Dakota Prescott
cowboys... 😂😂😂
At this point we going for Caleb willams more than the cardinals SKOL!
Micah still weak against the run, he has no awareness, he just keeps going after the QB and forget's to take into account run plays. I can believe people were even comparing him to the great LT. Not even f'n close. LT was a menace on the pass and run. The cardinals would just run to where Micah's spot is because he would just fly in and not take any angled lanes to control his perimeter. The other end was basically the same, they just kick block him out to run up the B gap where he originally was and they would get big runs. Both ends are also very undisciplined against cut-back's.  EDIT: The $40 million dollar QB isn't him no matter what cowpokes fan's say. We've seen it time and time again. Always fails when they need him the most.
Cardinals are definitely not tanking for caleb.
We ain't tanking 😂😂😂😂😂
Time to bring in Cooper Rush
Prescott isn’t a winner
Cowboys looked really bad today but that’s the Cowboys.
The Cardinals looks good well coach team
How do you lose to the sick man of the NFL.
Dobbs is the future
And they could cut this s*** short the second Dak threw that interception 😂😅
Tennessee like we gave that quarterback up 😭😭
being realistic as a calbowys fan with prescott bo we are going nowhere he is not a real competitor  ￼  ￼
Thanx Zona. But still you are stuck with Ganon. An Eagles fan
What happens to Micah? He been talking a lot about Hill and forgot they have other games to play
What a win from the Cardinals 😮🏉🔥🔝👏
I never understand why the cowboys keep wearing the ugliest uniforms in football year after year! Its like they love to look ugly!
thats the cowboys we know
Passing in the red zone......😂😂😂😂
Dak really lost this game in the red zone which made it hard for their defense due to the inability to make touchdowns. Cowboys need to get a better qb if they want to win. Defense played good enough that if they scored touchdowns they would have won.  This looks like last years team can’t stop the run or rpos and can’t score
Thank you cards for popping that Cowboy bubble!😂
The cowboys wr must of not been getting open and that QB the Cardinals got my bears need 😂 Murray is gone
offsides 54 at 8:28
Josh dobbs looks like a million bucks compared to Justin fields
How about them Cowboys?
Dan Quinn need to stop blitzing so much he run a Nascar defense he need to stop it
dem boyz got exposed 🤪🤣😂
Stephan A gone drag this loss out all week 🪦
We’ll be back.  Y’all better enjoy this loss.
All these haters taking time of their obvious boring life’s to watch my boys. Haha 😂
Always great seeing the Cowgirl's annoying fans stfu. Good job Cardinals! Cant wait to hear what Stephen A. Smith says haha
Just like thee old Cowboy Cardinal game🏈good game even though they whooped us
Mr doobs has played with alot of heart through three games, they actually should be 2-1...🙎🏽💯
get yo popcorn ready, cause shannon sharpe, stephen a is gonna have a field day, then u can click over to fs1 to watch skip make excuses
How bout them Cowboys!😅
Dak do me a favor  dont go to the super bowl. Ok I'm sick of being embarrassed by  your false attempts.  Let the follow up QB take over.clearly put every time the chance to go to the super bowl arrives. You buckle. I'm sick of it I want the 6th ring we deserve. You stay home .
SAME OLE COWBOYS 😂HYPED UP WITH NO BITE
Stephen A. Smith becoming a Niners fan is probably his best choice ever. I remember every year except last year and this year, he was against the Niners every week, and they didn't lose lol. 99% of the podcast and media host choose Cowboys over Niners. Stephen A. Smith with the brag and rights tomorrow lmao. I am looking forward to what he'll say about this.
Nice one cowgirls
Hey its just Dak being Dak
The Eagles will run the Cowboys out of the building 😂😂😂
Dallas against the fake flags again and Dak messed up again we need another QB plain and simple
I’m looking forward to watching ESPN First Take tomorrow for obvious reasons. 😎🤣🤣🤣
Going into this week I figured the Cowboys were the best team in the NFL.  I don't think that anymore.
i wish dallas would start trey
D Prescott must have seen a Valley-of-the-Sun mirage because no one was open on that interception inside the ten at the end.
All I’ve heard for the last month is cowboys defense ! Cowboys defense ! ..so I finally decide to bet on the cowboys …and they lose to the cardinals 😅
Anytime game the Cowboys lose, is a good game!
Wow surprising they won but great win🏈♥️
Congratulations to the Arizona Cardinals!!! Is Dallas defense overrated?
Bad calls
This wasn't an upset. Gannon came from the E-A-G-L-E-S Eagles 🦅
haha how's that superbowl coming boys
How ya lose to a a team that don’t wanna. Win. 😂😂😂😂😂
Cowboys are back
One thing I have learned over the last two decades, the Cowboys will always find a way to disappoint.
Stephen A is going to don the Cowboy hat tomorrow. May even have the cigar, too. Who doesn’t love this? Oh yeah. Cowboy fans. 🤣
On behalf of the entire nfl except the cowgirls fans, thank you cardinals.
they were definitely playing the field Diggs wasn't in.,
Cowboys fans in hiding
How bout dem boys!?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
SAME OLE COWGIRLS😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅
Dak is fine as long the defense, o line, and special teams all playing at max level but when Dak has to carry any of the burden cowboys lose.
Wow
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS lol!
Rise up cowboys haters, this was the best possible result.
Oh boy, Americas team lost. Looks like the Dolphins are going to the dance now..
Goooooooo cardinals. One favor Dallas take all the cowboys fans in Arizona back with u thaxxx
We couod had win but I didnt see no want to win , game  was rigged!!
When America’s Team Loses, America Wins
Cardinals has speed..very fast team..glad to see the cowboys lose..lol
This should lock up the #1 draft pick for the Bears.
Was expecting them to lose by one, going for 2 leading 9-0 sure makes you look stupid. Doing it again, well.....
Haha..I always have told people dak is the black romo..  Cowboys passed up on so many QBs because Jerry had a dude crush.haha  Still love my boys, one day we will let dak go.
I love watching the Cowboys lose. Cardinals looked fantastic! I hope Dobbs has a long career
That’s why Dallas got Trey Lance😂😂😂 Dobbs threw better than Dak.
They was talking that big boy ish after 2 games and can't beat the Cardinals. Wait til Deebo and company get a hold of you.
1, 2 the niners are coming for you 😂
Also i hate the cowboys but i will give them some credit they do better in the draft them most teams .
Where are all the cowboys fans saying their the #1 team in the NFL. Cowboys totally over looked the cardinals this game.😮😮😮
Dallas coach mad as hell 😂😂😂
cowboy fans in that stadium, bunch of az resident sell outs.
I’m shocked they won
Eagles fan here😂😂😂😂 THANK YOU CARDINALS
Glad they lost🤷🏿‍♂️Maybe they'll lock in and ACTUALLY put their hearts into every game now
I bet the cowboys fans rolled up deep. Just to tuck their chains in and get back on Spirit air.
HAHAHAHAHAHALOLOLOLOLOLHAHAHAHAHAALOLOLOLLHAHAHAHA!!!!
Any given Sunday.
Dallas is who we thought they were! 😂
I hate to say this but you can't throw the ball into to triple coverage in the in zone I would rather him take a sack or just throw it away live for another play bad coaching to go for it on 4th and 4 would have been to within 3 and they made a stop the next series
I would be embarrassed to be a cardinals fan cause it sounded like a cowboys home game! That would've never happened here in Philly.  I dont care how bad the EAGLES could ever be it just wouldn't happen
"And that is why we play the game." -Chris Berman
An accident waiting to happen.
Wait! WHERE'S ALL THAT MORONIC TALK I HEARD THE LAST 2 WEEKS FROM PEOPLE TRYNA COMPARE PARSONS TO L.T.? Last i checked. L.T. ahowed up EVERY GAME.
THERE HE IS! THE REAL DAK PRESCOTT STOOD UP 😂🤣 Like i said. He was a bum in Mississippi State. And hes a bum now.
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS
Bro tf happened
Welcome to the NFC west Cowboy's 😂😂😂
Giants, Cards and Cowboys playing rock-paper-scissors.
Don't really care about the Cardinals, but it's always nice to see the Cowboys lose.
Stephen A is on cloud 9 rn😅
Prescott looked too timorous out there.
This gamer was won in the second quarter. I knew Cowboys would lose this game.  The Cardinals still not a Kansas team
Go birds
Welcome to the NFC West cowboys. No easy wins this week.
I loveeee thissss. I can’t wait to see skips reaction along with all the other sports analysts on the cowboys train🤣🤣🤣
I was going to bench James Conner but I'm taking a stock market approach in fantasy.  I start my players regardless of matchup unless its a bye week/injury.
Can I ask what the heck the quick yellow outline of the Cowboys defender up top at 7:07 was?
This pleases me.
My cowboys were exposed today . 49ers and Eagles will absolutely wipe the floor with us. Great game cardinals. Y’all were absolutely more prepared than we were
Gannon still a 🤡🤡🤣🤣
its just a bad day at the office. *THIS IS OUR YEAR* #CowboysNation ⭐👊🇺🇲
Cowboys were who i thought they were-frauds! Here in the DFW area just hearing all their jawjacking and my old man who lives near stadium said last week  fans were yelling to prepare for a parade in february!!! 😂😂😂😂
Cardinals are a "nothing to lose" team with a "everything to prove" QB
Cowboys are worried ahead the next game with 49ers. Stephen A: Cowboys ; Shannon S: Broncos
First time Dallas offense outplayed the defense
I increasingly believe the NFL is rigged, especially now with all the gambling.
Cowboys lost because they’re in the process of flushing out plays that work/don’t work for playbook purposes for throughout the season and into the playoffs and Super Bowl this year! Cowboys will easily and swiftly make the Super Bowl with ease. Mark my words.  I know what I’m talking about
Now you know why they brought Lance in. I like Dak but he just isn’t the guy and never will be.
So much for Dallas being a contender
GO CARDINALS
As a Dallas fan, through the first two weeks, I saw the weakness of the offense. Those games were mostly defensive wins. The main person causing those defensive TOs is gone. I knew today's game the offense would have to step it up. They didn't. Redzone is a huge issue. It's been an issue for years. You gotta get 6 when you go down the field that far. Or else you keep your opponent in the game. This offense is not good enough to win the division or an NFC title, not even gonna talk about a super bowl. The 49ers will destroy this team. The dolphins would destroy this team. Gotta work on redzone plays three redzone entrances with 3 points from them. 21 points would have changed the game. Maybe cardinals still march down the field and score but you gotta force that out of your opponent, make them earn it that way.
Is it me or does every game the cardinals play at home?
That was pretty embarrassing
Where the cowboy fans at??? Don’t see the same energy as last week lol
Why we talk about them we just fatten Jerry Jones pocket. Mike Mccarthy  offense looks suspect  and the d can't stop the run. Go against  top teams will get exposed. Hire a good coach  and get rid of Dak I'm sorry he C Bplus at best but you can still win as long as he stay In his lane .
Weird highlights, Dallas looks like they got a lotta yards but the lost the game!
This was bad all over the place for Dallas. The defense, the offense and the playcalling from the coaches. This was horrible Dallas.
One, excellent result. Cowboys got humbled. Two, what the heck was Arizona doing running two 2PC attempts in the first half with the lead? Weird.
Wow shocker kind of like the Dolphins winning 70 pts
This was beautiful to watch
Dak Prescott... The rest of the NFC East's secret weapon! How bout dem boys???
Dobbs still showing that UT spirit..
Where are the people saying the Cardinals are tanking the season? Where are the people who were saying the Giants beat one of the worst teams in the NFL?
where did this come from? .......... wow
Thank you Agent Gannon 🦅
Tackling in the NFL is horrific.
Jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja 😢jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja jajaja
Literally offsides on the parsons sack
The biggest thing I like about this loss is that it just keeps proving why Prescott ain’t the guy for this team. But thanks to Jerry it seems like he gonna be there for a while 💩
Arizona ❤❤❤  What a wonderful surprise! Cowsucks hahaha
F game
Dak Prescott
Josh Dobbs was a class act as a backup on the Steelers for years I am glad to see him get a chance to start and play well.  Same goes for Connor.
and this is why i will always ne a casual cowboys fan. joy taylor is redeemed.
How about them Cowboys? Skip. Lol
and cowboys fan think they can beat the niners lol
Cowturds being cowturds +13 cardinals easy money for me 😂
Screen pass on 3rd and 16
Thought they had the best defense in the league cardinals back up played better then dak
Just be patient. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What skip say,  How bout them Cowboys 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hey! At least they got 5 rings, tho!?!?! The cowboys are 100% absolutely winning this year's Super Bowl in Madden 24!!!!!
We’re them delusional fans at now 🤣🤣🤣
Cowboys the team to bet is all joy and the others was saying 😂😂😂.  My 49ers is the team to bet
Dobbs did them dirty. Arizona going to trade murray
Time to start Trey Lance!
Hahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahah 😂. Ah yes what a beautiful Sunday lmao hahah
James Conner is a BEAST
Dobbs was dottin that defense all day long :D. What a performance.
Parsons can’t do it all himself. Who can? Defense not elite
Seeing the Cowboys lose is the ONLY reason i still watch football.  And you just know they're gonna blame this on Diggs going down for the sesson...
No excuses when your America's team just bounce back next week.
Yep.....
Jerry Jones DIEversity QB is a moron, get ready for at least 3 more losses, Cowgirl fans
Congrats to Gannon and Dobbs!
Enough of the Cowboys defense,  what a pathetic performance.
How about them cowboys!! Whoa!! lol
Looking forward to the Niner game against them now....
Cowboys hater here, actually thought they would go a long while without losing this year. Thank god they reminded me who they are 😂
😂😂😂
Is it time to put in Trey Lance yet?
I knew everything was going down hill for the cowboys as soon as I heard their fans say “THIS IS OUR YEAR!” that’s when the curse begins💀😂
The Cardinals definitely have that fire in their gut.
Too many ads!
As a browns fan I’m happy to see my boy don a eat 🔥🔥💯🗣️
Niners fan here...  Congrats, to the Cards on their victory.  To the Cowboys fans who were talking a lot of smack last thursday, I'm not gonna kick you when you're down, it'll be a new week, and a diferent game on week 5. Stay humble.
How bout them cowboys lol
Cardinals put Dallas on notice😂🤫
Cowboys are the 5th best team in football...at best.
I thought the Cowboys already won the Super Bowl this season? Could've fooled me.
Can't wait for the Stephen A trolling of Dallas tomorrow🤣🤣🤣
Haha didn’t pick this one
I love how the losses have more views than the wins, this team lives rent free in peoples heads 😂
Its okay Dallas, you could be a Denver fan.
Jonathan Gannon needed this win and got it, says a lot for team to play like that when against the wall.
Cowboys lose, America wins.
PFF had the Cowboys #1 on their Power Rankings LMAOOOO
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS
Jerry will need a new WIG next week!
Same ole Cowboys.
😂😂😂
Oops some one got exposed. No one is as good as they were. Scary thing is that all the other teams will see and copy what was done today against the cowboys.
The more you hate on something, the stronger it gets. Keep hating 🤠 watch us rise
Dallas still a top 5 team. Dak just ain't a game winning QB 😅
Simple cowboys solution get rid of Prescott
This is the cardinals without Murray. Competitive.
😂😂😂😂cowgirlsK
Dallas Cowboys still considered America's team around the world championship or not. Been all over the world and that is concensus. That being said a new quarterback  is still needed.
Jitterbug 😂
The Cowboys is doing what they do best: Start strong and then keep going down. This pattern has become a tradition for the past 20-25 years, no exception.
Where the cowboys fans at?? 😂 Micah aren’t you the lion? Meanwhile the “cub” hill and his dolphins won with 70 pts! Parsons next time “shut the hell up” 😂
Cowboys defense wasn't good, the coaching decisions were bad,  the penalties were horrid, and Dak can choke like no ther QB in history.  Lol i have never seen a QB choke every single time the game is on the line. The only games the Cowboys can win are ones the defense dominates  because  they have one of the worst QBs in the game. What should be very concerning for fans is Jerry wants him even longer
They say imitation is the highest form of flattery. Cardinals out there doing their best 49ers impression was low key impressive. It warms my heart to see Dallas lose and choking on their own hype. Nice win, and see you next week Cardinals. Oh and Cowgirls.. best muscle up butter cup and get some rehab cuz you coming to the 49ers Empire in two weeks. If you wanna be the best, you gotta beat the best, and erybody was saying that was you. 49ers will be ready and have their house in order!
10:46 was such a bad interception. He had enough time to see the defender falling back in coverage. He could have just thrown it away or possibly hit the flat route.
My 49ers are gonna  Molly Whop the boys. 😂
I have been saying since the draft mazi would be a bust I have said for three years now how dak is not the guy to take the cowboys any where I have used my eyes to bring facts to these delusional, cowboy fans, who ball ride for dak to help them understand and ease the pain when the Cowboys do nothing in the playoffs again hopefully today was a lesson? Unfortunately I know it won’t be. 😂
Last night they were saying Dallas is the best team in the NFL. 😂😂😂
Cardinals got some favorable calls, but Dallas' defense lost them this game 🤦🏾‍♂.
this just in: reports of 50 inch flatscreens being shot all over the dallas/fort worth area😁😁😁😁
Cowboys really thought they were him😅
They should have put on Trey Lance at this point ... might as well. For the play time
Dak Prescott already in playoff mode..........yikes.
dak literally just made the worst throw i’ve ever seen in my whole life and i couldn’t have enjoyed it more
LOVE IT!!!!!!!
Where all the cowgirls fans 😂😂😅
🤣😂😅😆
Imposters.  Have fun stephen A.😂😂
LVE playing like he’s got money on the birds
Dear cowboys fans...Lean on me... when your not strong..and I'll be your friend.. I'll help u carry on... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mia, Sf, then Dal. Philly 4th for now. Dallas exposed today
Cowboys will be cowboys I love it f skip
COWBOYS LOSE; TEXANS WIN...YOU LOVE TO SEE IT!! 😂😂😂😂
Cowboys played like never before and lost like always.
I can rewatch this again and again im so happy gints beat the cardinals and dallas lost too them
How do you go from beating the Giants 50 to 0 to losing to Arizona?
Dobbs was always a gamer for the Vols. Congrats on your 1st win!
The announcer screamed too much, tune it down would be better
Cowgirls lose = America is happy 😂
Dak is wack
Trey Lance
Typical Cowboys!🤣🤣🤣
Watching the cowboys score in the 4th and know that’s the last time they’re gonna score is a good feeling 😂😂
Vintage dak triple coverage int.
Any given Sunday
The best team in the league 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 this is the year 😆 🤣 😂 😹 💩💩💩💩💩
Lets see how biased the media will be after the Cowboys loss . Best this and that they say , hmm yet beaten by the Cardinals and there run game . Jerry Jones must be thinking what do I hav e to do to be a winner .
Steelers legend Josh Dobbs gettin it done
The cowboys are among the easiest teams to hate in the NFL
Congratulations to the Cardinals. Stephen A Smith will have fun talking about this game on First Take.
That Dobbs kid is pretty good, Nice all around team win, defense, offense, and coaching
Surprise !!  Cards for the W
Super Bowl contenders 😂😂😂😂
49ers ❤❤❤❤❤❤
NFL: we don’t like bud light. Stop playing their commercials every 5 seconds.
Titans should have retained Dobbs!😢😢
As a Texans fan I hate the cowgirls seeing this makes me happy
Those non call PI’s were pretty egregious, but they still deserved to lose playing like that. Disgraceful.
On behalf of the rest of America, thank you Cardinals for picking this week to finally put together a complete game. You have given  us all the gift of premium Cowboys fans salt for at least the next week and we will all cherish it.
hahahahahahahaha
Felt like I was watching high school football game🤦🏼‍♀️
Dallas got exposed😂😂😂😂
The Cowboys were the #1 team in the NFL entering this week. The Cardinals were the #32 team in the NFL entering this week, and just won by double digits This game is absolutely the poster child for "any given Sunday".
Wow, Dallas defense looked like sh*t.
The Forty Niners have to see this Cardinal team is not a cohesion type team in general terms, they seem to be a talented individual players team unlike the niners
Cowboys fan here…I quit on Dak Prescott two seasons ago.  Sure you’re all going to say the defense gave up a lot of running yards, but Dak has not been getting the ball down field this season.  I hope he has another 30/35 season (30 TD’s, 35 INT) so Jerry Jones can put him out of his misery and cut him.
Always a good day when cowgirls get beat
มิราเคิ่ล
Yall do realize we missing ppl and refs ain’t call no PI if you actually watched the game but I’ll say cowboys screwed themselves over too many penalties.
Stephen A is laughing🤣🤣🤣
4-5
Dallas fans you still have time to grow up and change team , 😂
4-4
Time is running out on the clock and your running the football. Great play-calling McCarthy
Lmao ya they are who we thought they were overated and pathetic. Especially that trashy fanbase anyone who skip bayless is a fan of ya gotta question that n always go against it he is the pure example of a cowboy fan.
3-4
I really didn't think it made much sense for the Cardinals to go for two points on their first two touchdowns.  Thankfully, it turned out not to matter.  o
A full week of everybody, their mother, and their dog hyping up the Cowgirls after victories vs the NY teams, and they get got by a team literally designed to tank. Cowgril gonna Cowgril.
3-3
2-3
All imma say is any given Sunday
The first step in having a legendary championship defense. Is being able to shut down the run game. All else comes second.
Caleb.
GREAT WIN FOR THE CARDS!
Lol just a week ago they were clowning the giants for beating “the worst team in the NFL” and now you just got beat by them lol. Jones put up more points in the second half then the cowboys did all game.
How about those cowboy's
As a cowboys fan I’m not even mad I expect it we are known for loosing to sorry teams
Way to go Cardinals..even if you failed in the 2 point attempts ..you showed the rest of the league to beat Dallas you have to take risks. Congratulations 👏
😂😂😂😂
2-2
1-2
0-2
0-1
I have an uncle who's a HUGE Cowboy's fan. He lives in the Phoenix area, so I would not be at all surprised if he actually went to the game itself.
No QB is as overrated as Dak Prescott. Gotta love how his ball shrink every time he is in a pressure packed  situation. Never change Dak.
how bout them cowgirls?
This clowns cowboy fans were mocking the Niners for having a close game against the giants.. poverty team put up 28 on the “ NuMbEr OnE dEfEnSe “ 😂😂
As a saints fan. Cardinals you just made my day. My saints got me ticked off rn.
How bout those cowboys best defense in the league we super bowl bound bhahahahaha
Lol  cowboys second string offense line was literary playing against 1st string defense Cardinals 🤣... and we still have them sweating. Haters will remain cowboys Americas team 😂
Fun fact: These 2 teams used to play each other twice a year, since Arizona used to be in the NFC East, in the early 90s. Great win for the Cards.
As a Dallas Cowboys fan, I  continue to have concerns about Daks ability to be an elite quarterback. The past two games, our special teams and defense created numerous turnovers. Dak can't count on that every game. Kudos by the way to the Cardinals kicker who hit that 62 yard field goal. Amazing!
Trey lance is that you
That dobbs kid is nice
I know giants not in this post , don’t forget bout that 40 piece with fries and a soda on the side we gave y’all
Dobbs looks good
I think both teams played pretty good. It’s a big win for Arizona, who showed that they can run the ball effectively both for points and clock management. Typical cowboys scheme to under play their running backs. That fullback was getting some decent yards but they always shy away from it for the big play it seems.
Dallas Cowboys aka “MURPHY’S LAW” 😂😂🤣🤣🤣😭
and cowboy fan was really trying to talk mess to 49er  fan about only beating the giants by 3 possessions..this team is wack af so are the fans.
Run the ball on the cowboys,i think more teams gonna go with that' gameplan ,i know the jets mad and giants 😂😂
Wow red hot dallas losing to 0-2 arizona maybe the pats have a chance after all next weekend still doubt it but we'll see
Cowboys sold 🗑️
Prater from 62! The progression of kickers is insane 50yds is almost normal now
As a browns fan! Gotta love dobbs!!!!
Why do you care about the game? You should be ending racism. Racists!
3 offensive line players out and digs CB out too .. not surprised we lost 😢
Cowboys are such a joke lol. Get the easiest opening schedule in the league as always. Get hyped up all week about parsons being an "mvp candidate" and "best defensive player in the league" and they get smacked around by the cardinals that no longer have dhop, with their second string qb. And you can always count on dak to turn the ball over with the game on the line lol
Cowboys will never be successful with Dak Prescott. I have been a fan since inception (1960) and am done. The Jones family has ruined the Cowboys. God, I miss Tom Landry!
See I’m a cowboys fan but I seen this coming. Look what they did last week against New York too many field goals in the red zone if we score every red zone possession we will win more games. This loss could have been easily avoided im disappointed
Josh Dobbs is highly regarded here in Tennessee and its great to see him doing well after some years of bouncing around in the NFL.  Keep up the good work Josh!
😂😂 🦅 🤙🏾 im just an eagle soaring bye, dont mind me…
Until we replace Dak Prescott we will lose  to josh Dobbs lol 😭 and Gilmore ain't a number 1 anymore
Good to see dak in mid season form
Dobbs just took Murray’s QB job!
Tyreek 1-0 Parsons
I am not missing first take tomorrow😂
If only Shannon ain't let u internet trolls get 2 him over the whole Brady incident we'd get Undisputed after a Cowboys L
As an Eagles fan, fly Cardinals fly!
DAK IS OUR WEAKEST LINK 😡
All the cardinals are is a bunch black goons
Unbelievable!!!
yay we finally got our first win! go cards! 🥳
wanna see wut "skip bayless" gota say bout this one??? 🤔🤔🤔
🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸
Always happy to see Dallas lose :)
What was dak thinking on that last throw geez
I didn’t think losing diggs was going to be that big of an impact on the cowboys def. Lol
Let's See...It's Jason Garrett's Fault...Oh He's Gone.Oh It's Scott Linehan's Fault Oh He's Not There No More.Oh It's Kellen Moore's Fault Oh He's Gone.Cowboys Fans Ya'll Running Out Of Excuses.😂😂😂#DallasStillStinks🤧#FlyEaglesFly
This didn’t surprise me at all.  It’s exactly what happens around the time we all start hearing the annual “We dem boys!” or “We’re going to the Super Bowl!”  The priority has always been look good first, win second.  That starts with Jerry Jones and will never change.  How bout them Cowboys?
The Cardinals are not a bad team they can compete !!!  Connor and Quarterback Dobbs  played well. Defense was Ok but needs improvement.
The NFC West just got a little more interesting. The Cardinals won't be the pushovers everyone thought they would be prior to the beginning of the season.
Dallas made the Cards look like a Super Bowl team, and made themselves look like...well.....the usual Dallas Cowboys lol! Oh did they look awful!!
When dak prescott is your franchise qb lol😂
We got tony  we got dak we got cee D we the boys we going to the Super Bowl
As cowboys fan we needed this loss, hats off to AZ they needed this win I blame the defense for this
We dem boys lol
Could be 3-0? Only my beloved team could screw up the 2024 number one draft pick.
“How about dem Cowboys!” Actually I know what happened ..so I DJ at this Gentlemans club and we got this guy. He’s OK not a bad guy but one of those when it comes to the Cowboys..every year he jinxes them by saying “Super Bowl” well I saw him the other night and I actually praised the Cowboys and he first says no no..I’m not really saying anything but then of course he changes it and more or less said going to the Super Bowl?! 😳🤦‍♂️🤣🤣🤣 I actually still think the Cowboys are probably in the top three best teams, and it pains me to say that lol ESP as a Commanders fan! 😂
Who needs dhop when u got brown?
Yes ! my joy is full ! Cowboys LOSE 🤠😂 !!😁😁😁😁
Dear lord I swear every 20 seconds a commercial on this clip like wtf
Refs and missed calls…
Too many stupid ads
Same old Cowboys.  Time to move on from Dak, boys
Skip Bayless how you feeling buddy, how about them Cowboys 😢😥😭🤣😱😲😳😆
When the Cowgirls lose, America wins.
All I will say is Dak better watch out.
I didn’t get the point of McCarthy calling what like 5 straight running plays in the redone down 2 scores with the clock working against them..is that not trusting Dak or just being a terrible situational coach as usual ?
Cut it down to one advertisement or I will no longer view nfl highlights or anything nfl !
Only of Justin tucker did the same thing Matt did 62 yards 😂
Ah yes. Game on the line. And Dak completely shits the bed and throws an interception. Nothing ever changes. Looks like the Cowboys are just getting into playoff mode
You can call it a trap game but the Cowboys just got BEAT in all phases. Cardinals are better than we all thought, hats off to them👌🏽
What makes this lose so bad is Cardinals won't win again 49ers Bengals Rams Seahawks  so enjoy come with this same energy next 4weeks
Another fine Dallas Nalgas game.
3 starting oline out ...plus diggs...these dummies in the messages make me laugh    stfu   ☆
Just checking to see if ya'll still dem Boyz? 🤣   🦅🦅🦅
AmaZing victory!  Wow!
The was absolutely hilarious. Also I'm so glad Dobbs risky getting a chance to showcase his abilities. As a steelers fan, he's came a long ways from where he used to be when he first came into the nfl...
When you are down by 12 points in the red zone,cant kick a field goal because you would remain down by 2 possessions,you have all of your timeouts,and 6 yards away from a touchdown on third and goal,THIS IS EXACTLY THE MOMENT WHEN A TEAM NEEDS THIER QUARTERBACK TO MAKE A PLAY! And what does yall quarterback do,throw the most embarrassing interception of the season to send yall home 😂😂
WACK Prescott comes up short🤏 YET AGAIN! 🤭
What was Romo saying?, this is the team to beat😅😅😅😅😅
I blame ESPN for hyping up Dallas defense after facing horrible teams the first 2 weeks..  it’s way early to be calling them the best team or defense in only 2 weeks SMDH..
Congratulations Arizona
Nothing like a little football to go with my ads.
"How bout dem Cowboys"
Thank you Cardinals from a Giants fan. First, you let us come back from down 20 and then you brought the Cowgirls down a peg or two. Appreciate the kindness.
Cardinals uniforms are actually nice in game
Today is my birthday and I’m an eagles fan. Thank you cardinals
Dobbs has made a good NFL career by being smart and pleasant, and decent athleticism. Another UT grad, Tyler Bray, had a long NFL run by having a big arm and being useful in the qb room. It's interesting to watch how fringe players make careers.
Dak Trashscott
Isn't that the QB that Cleveland cut?
WHO CARES?
thanks to the Cowboys & Cowboys fans for being the gift that keeps on giving 😂👏👏
Question: Regardless of Fandom, does anyone enjoy these refball games?   Also, with gambling in the mix, it becomes egregiously suspicious.
How about dem Cowboys!! Never a disappointment. ....😂😂😂😂😂
Welcome back cowboys fan. Back to earth.
Dak's new name is Choke Prescott.
This is what will happen every time you rely on Dak to win a game for you. Your defense didn't show up. LMAO🤣🤣🤣
As Chris Broussard would say... F GAME
Dallas Capboys😂
*So who's ready for First Take tomorrow morning?!* 😃
Bears are def going to have # 1 pick again lol
Love you Dobbs.. from a steelers fan ❤
ey.. how bout dem LOSERS!!! Golly
Dallas Cowboys LOL. Most over-rated team!
How bout them cowboys 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That Elliot move backfiring. They can't punch it in the endzone. Knew it would happen. But dallas fans said he washed up. Wanted Pollard. Now look. Pollard had 122yrds. But can't get into the endzone.
Cardinals should invest in Dobb he has more skills than Murray and is looking good out there
Who's the beast? Arizona!
Ok so it’s clear that the defense still has this same weakness that’s somehow going unaddressed. They can’t stop the run. Period. They got exposed today. Idk how we have so a good defense but completely shell up against the run. It’s like they are so ready to get to the QB that that’s all the practice for.
Nobody told the Cardinals it was a tank season.
Dak said he was not gonna throw any pics bro at all this year badookie
I hope all these so called Dak lovers can finally see that he's overrated. He's no elite QB at all. The defense was struggling today, so it was his turn to carry the team but like always he chokes! Please don't use the whole o-line excuse. The Cowboys ain't going nowhere with him under center!
Today, we Cowboys’ fans saw the Cowboys we have been used to seeing for far too many years.
How about them cowgirls
🤣😂🤣😂👍🤣👍😂🤣😂🤣 Cowgirls
Cowboys=Over Rated
Didn’t MP said cowboys has the best defense in the league?
The Cardinals took it to the Dallas Cowboys piece!
cant spell Dallas without A$$ in it
The last three weeks the Cardinals have looked like a real NFL team. Playing hard, smart, and physical football. The new HC Jonathan Gannon is really putting his imprint on Arizona.
Cardinals running wild
How do these cowboy stans support this below average QB 😂 and senile owner?
WHERE YOU AT BASELESS!!!!
Hell yeah Az wait to take it to em
😂😂
Cowboys score vs NY: 70-10 Cowboys score vs real football teams: 16-28
Steven a will be in a good mood Monday.cant wait 2 watch him go cowgirls.
Cowboys fans really acted like beating New York at football was an accomplishment🤣
7 commercials for a 11 min clip, you got to be kidding
Giants fans have something to smile about this week 😁
Pretty soon the league is gonna refer to short passing attempts from dink and dunk to “Dink and Dak.”
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bud light will not recover
I love it 😂😂😂
DJ cue the music “Cry Me A River” *starts playing*
Anytime the Cowboys go 2-0 every fan is ready to reminisce in 90s squad and claim them Super Bowl already.  And every year, same ol' Cowboys. Never change Dallas😂
As an eagles fan im pleased 😭
God they were planning Super Bowl parade last week in Dallas
This one hurt,but we didnt diggs,who is not the best one of the best CBs. We'll bounce back! #DC4L #Wedemboyz #itsouryear
As an anti-Cowboy fan, thank you Arizona!  Anything that silences the Cowboy fan living near me is truly appreciated.
Man stupid refs and stupid league I saw Dallas offsides many fu.... times be not enough call against sh.... America's team
Cowboys are the gift that keeps on giving. Never change Cowboys.
No free lunch in the NFL
I wonder if youtube's traffic goes down with this many ads
I am not a regular Cardinals fan, just a fan of any team that is playing Dallas.  Go niners.
As soon as Dak throws an INT, they lose, time to Trey that Lance
Im sure loosing to a win-less team with a backup quarterback is somehow a good thing to Cowboys fans.
Love seeing the Cowboy loose
I don't fw Gannon but a Cowboys L is the next best thing when the Eagles aren't playing.
We fr lost to a second string qb for one of the worst teams this season.
2 words Skip Bayless
May gods strength watch over skip tonight....Hes gonna need all the love he can get
Cowboys fell apart
Cowboys:  We're America's team  America:  BUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Love to see me some Dobbs 🍊
Ok, now since this was a humiliating loss...HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS?!?!?!? 🤠🤡
Dallas Cowboys are Colorado of the NFL.
Love to see it lol
At first I was pissed DAL lost until I realised ARI is 7-1 vs DAL they owned them lately. Lol 😢
Dark is not a champion quarterback…this will hurt us every December when it counts!
i dont think i hear Mica Parsons name all game long were did he go lol
No excuses, the Cardinals outplayed us. Any given Sunday. *WeThemBoys*
Man i cant wait for tomorrow at work lol,you already know why
Like a lot of people suspected. The Dallas offense has been carried by the defense this season.  Make Prescott have to play hero ball and he will throw dumb picks.
Cowboys cooked 🫕 without Kyler Murray 😂😂😂
Calm down Cowboy haters most of our o line was wiped out
oh the cowboys have the best defense in football , hahahaha well the aint all that let me tell you
Nfl is scripted
Get ready, tomorrow all the talking heads are going to blame the loss on not having diggs just like they did about Kansas City losing because of kelcies injury …. 💯 😂.
As a life long Dallas Cowboys supporter I must say... Just another continuous example of Jerrah's Boy's doing what they do best...Choke...from Tony Chokemo to Dak Chokesalot... the Dallas Cowboys organization died on March 29th, 1994...RIP
The amount of ads on YouTube is insane now
The hate the cowboys have is CRAZY😂 we still have a better record than your fav football team🤣💙🤘
Cowboys gon b the cowboys
dak will be dak!! lol
HOW BOUT THEM COWTURDS!!!!! I love it!
Dak, you gotta thread the needle if you going to the middle. You cant float those.
Ooooff, and they said that the NFC West is a 2 team division.
What can go wrong.. will go wrong
The Boys have got to get an Offensive Line as was the case the last few years.  McCarthy calling the plays is horrendous!  Going for it on 4th down from the 4 yd line in the 3rd Qtr. down 21-13 was stupid as they failed to score on a pass play surrounded by Cardinals.  Bad choice on Daks part as were several others in the Red Zone in the 4th Qtr. getting no TD's???  This was an awful effort by the Boys.  Give the Cards credit they outplayed the Boys at every position, especially the head coach position...
i was laughing at people calling the cowboys the best team in football the second week of september , just hilarious
Cardinals first 21 points by the most obscure route ever.
Trey Lance time? Please
Cards forgot to tank. Gotta be better next time. This could be the worst game in Cards history because it could mean they miss out on Caleb Williams
Stephen A bout to have a day tomorrow 🤣
As a cowboys fan. What’s the point
Can’t wait too hear skip spew some bs on this loss
Where the hell was Dak throwing the ball on that int?   THAT'S why the Cowboys haven't offered him an extension as of yet.
Father time has a way of putting lives back in their place. That is, of course, how the aging process goes.
Cardinals may be tanking but Joshua Dobbs is playing for future paychecks
The "Replacements" are getting better and better every game.
BWHAHAHAHAHAHA THE COWGIRLS DO WHAT THE COWGIRLS DO
the cowboys were so full of them selves hahaha this should bring them down to earth
Wow I"m amazed can't belisve the Cardinals beat the Cowboys
Scooter: We lost to the Worst team in Football  Me: obvisously the Cowboys neede Diggs this game. Because The Cardinals showed up and won this game.
This addition of the Cowboys is a Superbowl team? 😂 McCarthy is a fraud, Dak can't throw a deep ball or read defenses, the Cowboys O-line is old and broken, the corners & safeties are slow, old and exploitable without Diggs, the receivers are slow, can't separate, CeeDee great slot guy, that's it and the defense is way overrated save #11 ...
It’s so awesome hearing the announcers “touchdown Arizona!”
Cardinals were motivated and McCarthy was out coached. Very vanilla on offense. Overall, the team was flat.
As a VOL fan. I am glad Dobbs has finaly got a starting QB job and is doing well.
Truly the Cardinals were America's team today
Yall definitely not them Boyz losing to Arizona 😂😂😂
this is what happens if you thinking SB and dont have full focus on the next game to come.
Dak gonna dak
This is the cowboys Ik 😂😂what can go wrong will go wrong
Number 1 D?   Go niners
My favorite team won! (anyone playing the cowboys)
Stephen A and Shannon Sharpe gonna be laughing tomorrow on First Take!
Yeah, it felt weird that the Cowboys started the season 2-0. They never had it.
safety/cornerback coaches needs to get FIRED!no reason for a wide open player in any game!!
How's about them cowboys?😂
Please never say again that Dallas has edge over 49ers again. There is huuuuge gap between them.
Dam the Cowboys couldn't even lose by 8 points. I had Cowboys+8 1/2
It's weird when every NFL smug projector  and elitists had this Cardinals team with zero wins. We know that wasn't going to happen. Fabulous game Cardinals against a Superbowl worthy adversary in the Cowboys. And you totally beat down the Giants last week for the most part. You guys should be 2-1. Congrats!
Dallas had scub backups on the OLine today. I wouldnt get too excited about the game one way or the other.
Embarrassing loss for Cowboy fans.
On any Sunday.
The Cardinals defense is atrocious!!! Apparently, not a single player on the defensive unit has a clue as to what it means to tackle your opponent.
AZ fans,this just me…by the time KM comes back and Dobbs is still hit or even warm I’m rolling with him
This is what happens when your fanbase crowns the cowboys champions before even playing a down the kool-aid is strong.
As a Cardinals fan, I was so looking forward to going 0-17. But the way they’ve played in all three games, I’m stunned….. and impressed. Feel like the 2021 Lions. Little in terms of talent, but the players would run through walls for their coach. Still want the first overall pick, though. #FaultforAlt
This the team that’s supposed to be better than the niners? 🥴
When the Cowboys lose, America wins.
Bajaron de las nubes a Dan tronco Prescot jeje.saludos
Next year will be Dallas’ year. We will lose in the divisional round to the 49ers but I can promise you in 2024 we will win a Super Bowl
Dak with two terrible red zone possessions, I think that sealed it. The interception in the end zone was baffling.
So many cowboy haters 😂we lost the BEST CB in the NFL what do you expect 😂😂
Absolutely love watching the Cowboys lose. They think they’re the best team in the league and they always find someway to screw it up, especially in the playoffs lol. Just curious to see how many excuses the cowboy fans make when they screw up again or even when they screw up in the playoffs if they even make it there. Cowboy fans always find something or someone else to blame it on. It’s never the Team’s fault L O L.
Only the COWBOYS !!!! I missed watching the game today but i knew as a Cowboys fan we can make any team look GREAT! We can be Miami one week and then the Bears the next. There's no in between
COWGIRLS FANS ARE CRYING 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
ROTFLMFAO  Dallas Cowpie fanatics what say you? So much for your high powered offense.  This was a good loss says Jerry.
I only watch the cowgirls to lose they never disappoint
Dem Cowboys never disappoint. 😂  Tney are the very definition of 'pretenders'.
Lets GO man, Football is Back !!
People are forgetting the head coach of the cards is Philly s old DC. He would know how to stop Dallas better than anyone.
Cowboys4life but man 😂😂😂😂😂
As long as the Eagles can run the ball witch they can there one of the best teams in the league at running the ball the NFC East is clearly there division.. look the cowboys can get beat up and thrown out the club upfront it is what it is
Even when Dallas is good they always find a way to disappoint.
Texas Coast Swiss Cheese Defence married to the Texas Coast Yellow Submarine with a screen door Offense.   Call that crawl , The Shart, Micah!!!
made parsons look really bad on the first play.... ouch
Dallas was looking forward to Week 5 that they forgot about Week 3 🤣🤣
Thx for beating the Cowclowns🤡
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂😂😂😂!!
The interception man did it again is he worth 75 million ?
As a Dallas fan... we got absolutely smacked. Our defense was HORRENDOUS today. Offense wasn't much better either. What a joke
LOL @ Cowboys
Cowboys laying an egg. You just HATE to see it smh
As a Cowboys fan we should've found a way to keep Zeke and Schultz.  Could've used that offensive lineman in the first round today to
We still dem boyz? 💀💀💀
The Cardinals are better than anyone thought they would be and the Cowboys are never as good as everyone makes them out to be.
Wow. that was impressive. Everyone is saying Dallas and Miami, tbh I think when MIami gets a few of their all pro players back on Defense they will be unstoppable. They just seem to get better every week. Good game by the Cards here, they really controlled the game well.
Jus one game mark my words super bowl ❤❤ #Dallas
In the down fall for  Dallas start 😂
Keep Dobbs, trade the midget with the attitude problem.
As a cardinals fan I’m jus happy we beat the cowgirls  #TankSzn #ThrowAwaySzn
Can't wait to see skip and Michael tomorrow
ThIs iS tHe YeAr ThE cOwBoYs ArE gOnNa WiN iT aLL🤓
Dak gonna Dak
What was Dak seeing when he threw that pick
When the cowboys lose we all win
Dallas Cowboys vs Arizona Cardinals
Dobbs looking better than Murray
I want to hear all these stupid analysis that was declaring Cowboys the best team in the league after week 2 lol
49ers own cowboys 🤣
Shows u how good Diggs was!
“Best team in the league”  *loses to the Cardinals*
Dak is a joke 6 trips to the red zone 1 td 3 field goals same ol same ol we will never win anything with dak yet jerry will extend him another 5 years watch smh pathetic
Lol ok😊.
Can't wait for SAS take 😂😂😂
That'll change up the Power Rankings.
No more super bowl talk 😂
DallASS went up against a nobody, and got BEAT TF UP by a nobody 😂
Did anyone else get 6 15 second adds on this video?
1:08 the block by number 14 got me bricked up
I’m laffn with Stephen A. Smith
Dak was over for along time...but now its time to go 😂
I hate being a Cowboys fan...
The most disgraceful loss the Cowboys could’ve had this season. Unless the Cardinals go somewhere or have more than 4 wins, this is an embarrassment
Caleb Williams. You. Are. A Chicago Bear
Same ole cowboys!! Lol! Same ole Dak!! Can’t win when needed…love it!!
The Cardz did the same thing to my 49ers a few seasons ago with Colt McCoy
What happened cowboys?
how about them cowboys
I literally just asked  a guy at work why everyone online was so hyped about the cowboys defense. I looked at their schedual and put them at a 500 team. This was one of their auto wins lol. No other fan base beats two teams in complete free fall and thinks their the greatest defense to play the game. Then gets yeeted by a below average team the next week.
Did somebody say the Cowgirls is the best team in NFC? Skip is going to cry again today.🤭🤭🤭
That Cardinals offense is taylor made for Dobbs
Cant wait for tomorrow on first take!😂
Wow, wouldn't have thought that the Cardinals would be the ones to expose the Cowboys.
Cowboys without Diggs really shows. We need another pick 6 leader to step up
Tony Romo and Dak Prescott are the same in many ways.  They can break  records and set new ones only under  zero pressure.  On the other had they   both can't ever perform under pressure . And who knows why they never get rid of them.
As a Packer fan i love seen them b#$&+es loose lmbooo 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Cardinals looked good. Cowboys looked bad. Dallas did not choke; The Cardinals deserved to win. But not sure why the Cowboys forgot how to play offense
😅😅😅😂😂😂😂 wait wait 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Man between all these wild upsets, close games, over time wins and the dolphins putting up 70 against the broncos I gotta say this has been a crazy week in the NFL..
This video's  3 sets of 2 commercials in only an 11 minute video can shove it.  Doesn't the NFL make enough money? Greedy b's
Thats the Dak we know. I was wondering where he was.
How bout dem card nals!!
Run the ball McCarthy!
They done went how about them cowboys!!!!   Tooo  What happened to dem doyzzzz
Cowboys 😂😮😮😮😮😮 for those of you that know the history of the Cowboys I think they are going back to losing lol😅😅. After beating  both them in NY 😂😮😢
Rigged 97percent on Dallas that’s why😂
Dooms day defense can’t stop the Run 😂
Its funny how when the cowboys lose all the haters come out their caves to hate😂but when they win everyone starts praising them and I’m not talking about cowboys fans
Shoutout the cardinals they been playing hard I thought they’d be dogshit
Dallas shows true colors. Dump dake!
AZ supposed to be 3-0 fr
clicked to watch, they better not lose to the cowboys
Dak Prescott chokes again lol
Told you.... can never take Dallas seriously 😂
I guess they do have that 🔥 in their gut lol.
GREAT JOB ARIZONA! Now I can go to work tomorrow with a smile on my face and with a diehard coworker who will be silent after that loss! 😊👍
Rednecks lose.......
Where's Stephen A. and his cowboy hat ? 🤣🤠
Dobbs looks good.  He is going to make the Cards forget about Kyler the Kancer.
😂
HOW BOOOOUUTT THEM COWBOYS!!!
HOW ‘BOUT DEM COWBOYS!!!!
Sooo I heard the announcers mention a 61 yard penalty, but I didn’t see it. Hey NFL, HOW CAN YOU NOT SHOW A 61 YARD PENALTY!? That’s just as good as a 61 yard completion or run. I read the Cowboys shot themselves in the foot with penalties, but I haven’t seen any. Those would seem important to highlights. We aren’t talking a 2 minute rundown as this is a 12 minute video. Just give me a complete picture of the game for the love of god.
How bout them BOYS!!!!!!
Cowboys kryptonite
Lmfao cowboys
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cowboys gonna Cowboy lol
Mike Mcarthy should have taken that bow for being 2-0 while he had the chance when Jerry suggested and Micah was complaining about the media not crowning them 2 games into the season.
STEPHEN A SMITH ABOUT TO HAVE A FIELD DAY
Even if this is the only game my cards win this year I’m ok with it 😂😂😂😂😂. It’S yOUr YeAr bOYs!!¡! 😂😂😂😂😂
Congratulations to Josh Dobbs! Dude has been tossed around like a hot potato despite showing potential. I know it’s just one win but he got him one. 🧡
Last week we saw was coming in 5 red zones field goals QB not good , then offense score points , not this time this game we saw the real Team ,,, average
I think anybody that hasn’t dug a hole and buried their head can see that Dak Prescott is at Best a back up quarterback. He had time to throw and he couldn’t make the throws. What people are not  saying is the entire defense of the Dallas Cowboys was set up to run on man coverage now that they don’t have Diggs there in deep trouble. I really believe everyone is running from the obvious. What in the hell is McCarthy running one on one drills with a shut out corner. I would not take a is premier cornerback and risk injury in practice with anything that’s remotely contact. He can work on conditioning and film and no contact drills. I don’t care what anybody says. The injury to Diggs is all on McCarthy and I know Diggs is not Deion Sanders, but shut out corners are rare, and should be prized and coveted. It’s all water under the bridge, but it’s gonna take time to adjust. This is not the same defense anymore and the next man up philosophy will not work because there is no one to replace DIGGS.
Cowgirls 🚮🗑
49ers vs chiefs  is gonna be our superbowl
Cowboys couldn’t stop the cardinals run game & they think they will challenge the 49rs😭😂 gotta love their delusional fanbase
Go birds
Good ol Dak throwing those picks
As only the Cowgirls can do...😂😂😂😂😂
It sure is a lot of hate in these comments 😂
Number 4 is really bad. How can he block it? He's controlled 3-1 and he's a very bad quarterback who can solve immediate problems.
Hopefully dak stays qb for cowboys lol
Cowpokers fan? You need to see a highly qualified psychiatrist 😂😅.
So what's the excuse gonna be cowboy fans 🤣🤣
Cant wait for undisputed tomorrow....ol skip gonna be blasting Dak!!! Lol i love it
Why can't any of these NFL players break just 1 single tackle????
Cowgirls looked good. But AZ. was just a little bit more avg than Dallas was hoping for.
Cardinals are good
How was your weekend, Skip? 😂😂
what about them boys hahahahaha
In 10:45 he could've went for Tony pollard
It's official the cowboys are not going to the superbowl.  Ridiculous
As i said overrated team that had no business being discussed with teams like the niners n chiefs n eagles n dolphins smh
Stephen A lickin his chops 😂😂
Cow girls got layed.😂😂
Same old Cowclowns. They hype the team up but at the end they lose.
As commanders fan this makes me happy at least they lost to
Congrats Cardinals! TAKE A BOW! You deserve it!
Cowboys beat two cupcakes and the fanboys are ready to proclaim them the best team in football.  NOPE.
Mike McCarthy calling the plays let's keep giving it to Pollard and running and up the middle. They totally had our running game shut down. But let's keep running it up the middle. Cowboys outplayed themselves
How bout them Cowboys
Cowgirls actually thought they were better than my Niners 😂 what a joke
That field in Arizona should be illegal for real.
UNWATCHABLE, too many advertisements.
Did anyone else $aw what happened?
Knock it off with all the commercials !!!!
cowboys first round exit confirm
Skipp: how about them cowboys 😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Yea putting the league on notice 🤣🤣🤣🤣 😆😆😆😆
Dak sees things to late
And there's the dak we all kniw and love.....proven LOSER
I’m one of the the few cowboys fans who saw this loss coming a mile a way this is the most cowboy type of game to lose
Cowboys ain’t even gonna make the playoffs lol
I am enjoying dallass imploding while they chuckle about the Giants historic comeback 😂
Please stop talking Cowboys and Superbowl, please. Opponents will use this game as a blueprint to play against them. Cowboys are OVERRATED.
Cowboy fans I never want to hear anything about a superbowl run u guys lost to josh dobbs lol travesty maybe next year ?
Dax still making fresh turnovers 😂
Haha i knew the cowboys would go back to there original form this week 🤣🤣
Santa Clara 49'ers go away, boys to men representative ain't got no fans here.
Dak is wack, but to his credit, he doesn’t play on defense.
Cheering for these boys they got good energy
Cant believe we lost to a make a wish kid
I knew we'd lose this game. It's hard being a Cowboys fan these days. Just glad i got to witness the 90's superbowls, cos at this rate i may not see another in my lifetime
Thats okay 1 game lost no biggie bby
Kyler Murray happy because the Cardinals are going on a win streak to avoid drafting Caleb Williams 😅
Cowboys fans say they are beating everyone every year! Especially in playoffs!!! I mean one way to look at it is they’ll eventually be correct. Bahahaha!
Not bad game going running game both teams..
Took the Rams strategy against the 49ers, it worked!😅
Cardinals got more hard boiled eggs than the Giants and Jets combined. Shout out to the Cardinals
Either the announcers have the most abhorrent lisps in the history of broadcasting, or the sound guy needs to get fired.  Oh, and Dallas just got beat by the Arizona Cardinals.  With Dobbs at QB.
In the Past 25 years the Jets have more playoff wins than the Cowgirls 😅
That was a wicked surprise! Great win for the new coach and Dobbs!
Dobbs deserve this opportunity to start. Good for him.
So much for "America's Team."
W
More Fake Sports The Wins The Losses It's All Fake!!
Gotta love when the Cowboys choke season starts early
Cowboys offense is mediocore at best they struggle scoring touchdowns. They the field goal kings no matter what field position the defense gives them they rarely convert for 6.
Cowgirl fans talking about Superbowl 😂
Dallas Cowboys can overcome this. Touchdowns in the redzone produce wins. Congrats Dobbs and Cards.
What do when your QB can’t throw for no more than two yards at a time! Sorry Dak but you’re not the Answer and this is coming from a fan since 1968 Thanks Jerry
😂😂😂😂 i love cowboy fans
After beating the Jets, y'all Cowboys fans screaming Super Bowl...today crickets!
Yep confirmation the cowboys are overrated 😂
Weren't yall just claiming to be the best team in the league 🤣🤣 Dak is horrible
Knowing dallas we will win the games but always lose to teams we are clearly way better then...
Congrat Cardinals!!
No excuses Dak, no excuses 👎 Why throw it, in between 3 defenders in the end zone!! Tell me you need glasses, lol🤓
Depression.  😂😂😂
How ‘bout them cowgirls yeehaw!
I've never seen a more "maybe next year" fanbase like the cowboys in all my life 😂
Nothing goes better with a cold beer than a cowboys loss
Dogs were barking this week.....a parlay with Cards, Texans, Colts 💵
Fire Dak Prescott. Having a 44 million contract and throws the ball to the air.
Boo hoo, Dallas loses, boo hoo!
A piece of the lone star stayed in the desert today 😊
9:16 Talk about wide open!
Can't wait for James Jones on Speak and what he'll have to say as who his best team is this year so far now, what huh?
Between this and the Dolphins putting up 70 on Denver, this may go down as the funniest day in NFL history 😂
Bills fan here I hate cowboys more than patriots this is a nice surprise
This falls on Dak Prescott, he’s not that guy
SKIIIIIIUUUPPP!!!
Rigged
Prescott is the sparkplug that only fires when there is no pressure
Makes my Giants win a little more credible
Call me crazy but I'd rather have Dobbs start instead of Murray. Murray always tries to do to much
But they better then the 49ers?
I called this last week when I said that the Cowboys red zone defiencies were going to cost them games. I got so much back lash lol. The play calling is ridiculous. I also said that the only way to beat the dallas defense was with a run game and quick passes. That's what happened today. People bashed me as well lol. I was called a fake fan. I didn't jump on the 70-10 hype. I'm a realistic Cowboy's fan.  Then, add all this with penaltes and Dak throwing that INT at the end. Best believe other teams will use this formula to beat the Cowboys. The need to make adjustments on offense and defense. Especially  the red zone.
So..... starting to think week 1 was a fluke against the giant's
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS?!
Take offensive cowboys on a different game plane.
lost to one of the worse teams in the nfl  that's cowboy football haa losers😅
Refs helping the cowboys yet still lost.
So, to ALL the ones that’s saying the Cards are tanking this year, well……looks like they’re really doing a masterful job doing it so far 😂 They actually could’ve been 3-0 since they came close to beating the Commanders first game then lead my Giants 20 to nada in the first half last week, then look what they did to what practically everyone was saying the “best defense” so far (3 wks of the season). Bottom line folks…..#PlayersDon’tTank #AnyGivenSunday
I keep saying the san thing over and over Cboyz need to get rid of Dak please put the rookie QB #15 in the game and get rid of jerry jones
As a dallas fan, I was hurt in my soul, knowing that we were done for agter the second half 😭
This weekend wasn’t pose to humble Prime…if anything it humbled Skip and Irvin…
First Colorado then Dallas, two media hype trains went completely off the rails!!!!! Dak Prescott is a joke, should be a backup at best.
the cowboys are who we thought they are never going to win anything with dak.
Cowboys fans: “We’re stacked this year, even if we get a few injuries we’ll win easily.” Cowboy fans after 1 injury: “of course we were gonna lose, we’re down a player”
Absolutely ❤️ it when the Cowgirls lose!
Cards fan living in Central Texas.  Tomorrow at work is going to be epic!
If the defense don't play lights they'll probably lose to a half decent QB. 🍸🏖️😂😂😂
COWBOYS FOREVER ♾️ u_cant_c_angel_01 for some bada** COWBOYS LOVE
Cowboys fans we lost cause we sleeping on the cardinals, 😂😂😂 You cant sleep on teams early in a season, the eagles 2-0, commanders 2-1, giants now one game behind with 1-2 record, the cowboys just got outplayed and outcoached.
1rst round pick CINCINNATI  OHIO STATE BUCKEYES Paris Johnson Jr. dominated the Cowboys defense and Micah Parsons  that was the difference .
Since, 1996 the Cowboys have had more probowlers than ANY other team, and in that time frame they have less playoff wins than the Jets.  They are who we thought they were.
Giants and Commanders celebrating like they’re not spending the rest of the season fighting for third in the NFC East 😂😂😂😂😂
I feel like the Boyz dumped this game on purpose but then again it is the Cowboys.
Wow! Even when Kyler Murray doesn't play he still wins, his winning streak continues he has never lost to the cowboys.
It seems like an 0-17 season is impossible if the Cardinals can pull off such an upset.  Our only hope is the Broncos, who got obliterated by dolphins.
Wait until week 5. That weak Dallas defence is really gonna get exposed against the NINERS!!!!!!! 👍😆❤️💛
smh.. as a cowboys fan.. games like this HAPPEN. it is what it is.
Dak losing to AZ means Lance should start soon. ;)
I can’t wait to watch Stephen A Smith tomorrow on first take!
What's more embarrassing?  My Broncos losing by 50 to the Dolphins?  Or Dallas losing by 12 to the Cardinals?  🤔
And just like that, just in time for Halloween Dak turns back into a pumpkin 🎃 😂
cocky team just underwent a rocky fall
Dobbs and that running game of AZ ate the Dallas “D” up !! Ooooh weeee!
Love seeing the cowpies lose
Watched the game looking for that #1 once in a generation DEFENSE to show up.  STILL looking...🤣🤣🤣❤️💛
Arizona knows something we dont . Theyre bringing the ENERGY
How you lose to the weakest team in the NFC west
Pinche Dak wei 😭 😭 😭 DC4L !!!!!!
So they basically had the same problem as the jets game..... having issues with their offense in the red zone
Good job az
I like Josh Dobbs a lot fr he for sure should be a starter
"America's Team" loses, America rejoices. As it should be. How 'bout them Cowboys?
Players still slipping on that pos field
absolutely the most hilarious thing that could ever happen this week
Ezekiel should've taken Dak with him 😖
Typical Cowboys
I guarantee you that it was some tvs broken today 😅😂
Cowboys … the literal embodiment of disgrace ( eagles fans here 🦅)
Someone check on your boy Skiiiuup Shameless!!
Cowboys still have the same issue as last year if you attack the outside you usually are good. Screens, outside handoffs etc work wonders on them because they are so quick and rush inside so well that it actually makes it a weakness of theirs
As a Titans fan, we should have kept Dobbs!!!!!
Drake prescott !!! Adios!!!
Absolutely pathetic....3 times inside the 5 only get 1 FG...the offense is regressing...they lose Diggs and the defense crumbles...like I said before the season started the Cowboys are going to do what they always do.
Got to love all the losers who have nothing better to do with their lives than root against the Cowboys.  Pathetic.
They are who we thought they were🤣🤣 my boys never disappoint
Am I the only one who loves this matchup visually?
I want to see the faces of all the TV Pundits who said Cowboys have the best defence in NFL. 😂 Goodbye to that.
Rise up red sea! 💪
i dont feel sad the ravens lost now
Thanks cards ... signed Eagles nation
No way
Well, now we just witnessed for one game what happens when the cowboys have to rely on their offense.
This defence being wasted on dak
Oh god could the Broncos actually get Caleb Williams?
How bout them cowboys
Dak was a beast in this game! The coaching staff making so many wrong calls and cost the cowboys this game!
Dallas will never win a super bowl as long as Dak is under center.
Welcome to the NFC west, the toughest division in the NFL.... I cant wait  to see the 49ers vs Cowboys now lol... thank you cardinals for doing what the entire country loves watching. From a 49er fan 💪
Everyone says Dallas beat bad teams. Didn't the Jets beat the bills. The Giants came back and beat the Cardinals last week. And cardinals lost against commanders. Just saying.
Dak cant throw a receiver open and has hard time throwing up 50/50 balls but he will definitely throw into triple coverage for an int!!😂😂
I’m being so fr why do people hate the cowboys so much, fans sure if people annoying I get it. But why hate on them so much it just seems like follower mentality to me.
Back to reality.
So they loose one player and they're not so dominant huh? SMH. 3 words......ANY......GIVEN.......SUNDAY.
And Dak throws it into triple coverage for an interception and running any chance of a comeback almost like it’s expected
Ahh the Cowboys we all know and love....
Dak is screwing us as a cowboys fan we have to admit that pollard was open on that last possession an he throws to the one with 3 defenders on them he should have been gone with zeke
Dak threw another costly pick ain't nothing new, Time to see what Trey Lance has in his bag😏
As a Niners fan, about about them cowboys?
I predict a pick party going forward
The Cowgirls are WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE!!!
Southern Stephen A is a Happy Man after this game....
If screen passes dont count how many TDs does Dak have😂😂
🤣🤣🤣 what happened to #1 offense and #1 defense🤣🤣🤣 oh wait u guys don't need to panick it's only the 3rd game🤣🤣 don't worry my niners will get them for you next week😁  i onow u cant wint them all but cowgirls lost against a second string quarterback😂😂 play tray lance instead😂😂
I keep saying it....dak is 🗑️.  Will never win a Superbowl with him.
The Dallas Cowboys, the most expensive team of all professional sports in the world, could not beat the Arizona Cadinals, a fairly mediocre NFC team; and there are still those who say that this will be *_"the year of the Cowboys and that they will attend the Super Bowl"_* . That's not gonna happen. Cowboys fans: _Thanks, you all make these losses so satisfying_ 😉
The Cowboys looked like the Cowboys today
For the non-Cowboy Fans, make sure you like this video
Dak throwing an interception at crunch time is SO iconic.
That was one of the most cowboy games of all time
Dallas #1 defense,     against week team... Dak top 5 qb,     against week team... Next time finish the  sentence so that america will not get confused😂
Not a cardinals fan. So idk. But here's a question. Has #13 (the cb) ever NOT been beat? Lol. I swear if the ball goes his way someone beating him or wide open. He can't tackle much either.
We always lose to the Cards!
As a niner's fan, Redskins, Giants, Eagles, Steelers and 49ers nations are more than thrilled and satisfied with the Cardinals performance.
The audacity of these clowns from Dallas who thought they could beat the 49ers 🤣🤣🤣🤣.
I’m a cowboys fan. I said in the game preview that Arizona can win this game if they just run the ball and not have any turn overs. Dallas has horrible run defense.
The Cowboys got confused and thought this was the divisional playoff game.
The fix was in for this game, Arizona should not be allowed to play in AZ with how bad the officiating was in during this game, If the NFL doesn't do something about this, it will only get worse.
The cowboys are who we thought they were
And they still claim to be America's team...Lol...This team is such a joke.
Without diggs the defense is way differnt. They couldn’t stop the run at alll
How did this happen
And they were saying the cowbitches are the #1 team in the NFL 😭😂
‘Imagine not beating the Cards?” - Giants fan
i got 2 questions.  What happened to Tyler Murray AND  is that Dobbs that used to play for the Steelers ?!?!
Dobbs did well
America's shitstain. 💙🩶🤡💩
Been a life long cowboy fan wish it would be like it was back in the 90’s but it never is gonna be with this quarterback.
Dak is the ATM America's Turnover Machine
I believe the Cards have defeated the Cowboys something like 6 of the last 7 meeting now, they have their number seems like.
I knew when the said Diggs was out for season that Dallas would lose and become a different team they lost all confidence
This was but one game.  It would be much more satisfying when the Cowboys get to the playoffs with all the hype then choke again.
Dak starting to give me Tony Romo vibes
Dobbs > Murray
The real Dallas Cowboys 😂
Game summary: How to beat Dallas defense: RUN 😅🤣
We can all agree that the universe is a better place every time the Cowgirls loose!!!
Great job Cards!!
This was a tough week for dallas losing t diggs and 3 starting lineman, dak was not good today and still is afraid to throw in endzone
Glad someone finally beat this Cowboys team that tricks people EVERY single year. There is NOTHING different with this teams Cowboys team than the past teams, yet people fall for this EVERY YEAR. And it's fitting that the Cardinals beat them, and everyone chalks it down to 'Oh the Cardinals are actually really competitive this year!!"
As a Giants fan nothing makes me more happier than when we played Arizona and came back and people we're saying " o tHEy'Re tHe caRdiNalS"😂... thanks AZ
Cowgirls got exposed lol 😂😂😂😂 go niners 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
One lost & everyone thinks it’s over🤣
Wait I thought the cowboys were the best team in the league lmao
Everytime Dallas loses, America wins.
This was absolutely hysterical. Every sports analyst this week kept saying, “Don’t worry, they will be 3-0 after this week. We need to look to week 5.” At least every one of those same people will shut up about how amazing the Cowboys are. Honestly this team is slightly better than average because of the defense. The Offense has not looked great all three games, yet, analysts continue to say they have an amazing offense. Nothing they have done this year has suggested their offense is any better than any other year so far. And this is coming from a life long Cowboys fan. Any time any DFW team gets any sort of elevated recognition, they fall apart. So to every sports analyst saying the Cowboys will be in the Super Bowl, how about you take a step back here and relax. Until they can win more than 1 playoff game every few years, it isn’t gonna matter.
How bout them cowgirls 😂
It’s moments like these that I wish Shannon Sharpe was still on Undisputed.
Presscott again & again....
Ppl was counting the cowboys 3-0 before the game all week 😂
This is hilarious
I wouldn't care if this was the only win the cards got I am satisfied with this win
I don't understand the hate for Dallas. The maturity level of the haters is around 3rd grade level.
How about them, cowgirls? Yeah, well, we had to hear about you guys the last 2 weeks kicking the s*** out of my giants, then my giants kicked the s*** out of Arizona, so go figure, but see dak is nothing look at that pass he through to the ground in the end zone  okay, dak is just another Romo as all. He is  I still would take Daniel Jones over Dak if Jones had a offensive  line like Dak has you will not beat 49ers or Eagles  or kc or the Bills stop with the SB Talk I no ever year is ur year  how about them cowgirls
It's okay Cowboys get to feast on The Patriots next .lol😂
Thanks cardinals
This should be a pretty short video... I don't think the Cowboys had any highlights. Except in their hair, maybe.
Cardinals are a great team. The Boys can’t win them all. Ggs
GREAT GAME BOTH TEAMS I CANNOT BELEIVE MY BOYS LOST MAN THEY PLAYED HORRIBLE TODAY I KNEW DAK WASN'T GOING TO COME BACK   AN GREAT GAME CARDINALS BREAKING THAT 2 GAME LOSING STREAK PLAYED WELL MADE SOME GREAT PLAYS KICKER DID PHENOMENAL WITH THAT 62YRDS KICK FARTHEST I SEEN
Womp-Womp…..
Gg Lets go CARDS🔥💪🏽
Cowboys are frauds
Them those there cowboyd
Prescot le hace daño a cowboys debe salir esta temporada
Cowboys looking good🔥🔥
Cowboys defense lost them the game, and the offense did not play good enough.
Dak is Jimmy G with better PR.
Leave it to the nfl to have 6 30 second ads
It feels good that all America loves n hates the COWBOYS
and the cardinal fans laughed when they picked up Dobbs
Cowboys lost to the Cardinals without Murray lol 😆
You know what is funny the Cowboys only have two modes delivering a blowout and losing and no in between
Before going to work i was talking to a cowboys fan and he said he wasnt gonna watch much of the game cause it was going to be an automatic win. Boy was he wrong 😂😂😂😂😂
Where was Micah at??? 😂😂😂
Can’t wait for first take tomorrow morning 😂😂😂
Dak Prescott is just bad man. Outplayed again by a nobody
Super Bowl baby😂😂😂
Sleep number bed gonna be used tonight…….😮😮😮😮😮😮
Can't wait to play Dallas twice eagles will destroy them .who loses to Arizona wow.
Another Year Another choke fromt he Dallas FraudBoys
I am about done with Dak Prescott..
Dak quit on the team and let them down.
Didn’t watch the highlight, immediately came to the comments to read the cowboy cope
Ah cowboys y’all never let me down.😂
The Cowboys are who we thought they were...Rip coach green
this means Giants is more better then cowgirls
Dallas cmon
Josh Dobbs looks so good on this team. He was brought in to lose. He had 2 really really solid games and now this upset. I'm a fan. Keep this guy employed
There ya go cowgirls back to your usual form lol. These aren’t the giants or the Zach Wilson jets 😂😂😂
Stephen A is going to have a field day tomorrow lmao
Can't win kicking field goals! Cardinals earned the W!  Cowboys needed a kick in the rear. I hated all the hype. To early to crown anybody especially my Boys!
Ahhaha the cowgirls are back hahahhahha
Daks interceptions be youth football like 🤦🏾‍♂️
yall really dont understand😂if you watched the game live micah was being held the whole 1st half by itself not calling nothing but its all good we gone take this L and keep movin forward.
They needa stop rushing an blitzing Micah let him sit an be a lb tht why they can't stop the run
Old nfc east match up cowboy fans are sick losing to the cards today
The 2 wins the cowboys had was against two of the worst teams in the NFL.
Dak is an average Quarterback who will never take us to the Superbowl we should have gotten rid of him &  Elliot years ago.... another average year.
🎀 WE DEM GIRLS 🎀
😂😂
The Arizona Cardinals get the W!!! That's a win for Kyler Murray!!! Let's go Cardinals!!! Rise up sea red!!! We miss you Kyler!!!
God it does your heart good, don't it?  🙂 12-point _underdogs_, you say?  Sure about that? I hear all America laughing.
its so funny to me how cowboys haters come out the woodworks as soon as they take an L, but are silent asf when their winning XD
The Cards whipped them Boys good.
Lets go cowboys 🤠
BTW: DOBBS is excellent at reading coverages!!🤓🤓🤓🏈🏈 Something those runners lack in Illinois & Chesapeake Bay!!
Mmmhmm, they can't stop the run. Eagles are gonna love this.
I know its one game but if we go by the numbers there should be some glaring issues. Dallas could only manage 16 pts against the Cards who gave up 31 to the Giants who can only post 12 against the Niners and scoreless the second half. Where does that put the Niners vs  Cowboys talk of being the best in the NFC? Next weekend is Cards vs Niners, then Niners vs Cowboys. We will see in 2 weeks who leads this division on the first go around.
They really miss Trayvon Diggs would have made a huge difference
lets go!
Omikik
as a commanders fan, this made up for our loss today. thank you cowboys, never change.
Players that rush the passer/ Micah/ Lawerance/ don’t like to play the run 🏃‍♀️. The cardinals just gave the blueprint on how to beat the Cowboys. And Dak is being Dak again with a interception trying to complete a pass. To a player that had triple coverage. Good win cardinals
No excuses about injuries because everyone saying we looked bad even though we won while having injuries 😂😂😂😂
A few weeks ago in the NYG vs Arizona game I took notice of #9 Dobbs at QB. Saw something very special about him and when everyone last night sold him short, I thought he’s gonna SHINE ON SUNDAY 🏈🏈 Way to go Cards👍🏽👍🏽Got the (W)!!
How bout them cowboys!!!!
😅😅 HOW BOUT THEM COWGIRLS 🤣 love it
How bout them cow-girls!
Dallas wasn't ready ...at all. Diggs injury played a factor too.
Ladies and Gentlemen "THE BEST" Defense in the NFL 😂
Dallas is good they all need is a better quarterback
Imagine cutting out the guy all in Gallup’s hand that should’ve been a touchdown 💀
How bout them cowboys. Done
happy when cowboys lose
Apparently Dallas aren't the best team (im shocked 😂) and the NY teams just stink.
Dak was clutch.
pls send help, I can’t stop watching that last INT lmaoooo
Cards just took it to dem boys!!!
bears fan thank you cowboys for losing at least i have something to enjoy today
My cowboys should have won the game
i'm just trying to find out who exactly was Dak throwing to on that last INT lol dude was double covered anyway w/o the LB
Espn host says the Cowgirls are the number 1 defense 😳 ummmm looking shaky today
CONGRATS MR DOBBS!!🎉
Wow they look like a completely different team without diggs😂
Is the first time ever a tanking team beat a leading Super Bowl contender?
All the sad pathetic cowgirls out there making excuses just as usual ur gonna get 11-14 wins and still lose week one or two in the playoffs same old same old this is the start
go dobbs! love that dude! go browns!
Yes Cowboys let me down again
🤣🤣 that's for all of you cowgirl fans who live in other cities all of you front-running losers  😜
From eagles fan thank cardinals now we are the only team in  nfc east unbeaten
Same every year.... cowboys believing their own hype. God I love it when they get beat!
Love seeing dejected cowboy fans. Thanks Cardinals. You had many of us Niner Faithful rooting for you. - this time.
Yeah …thank god for this ..I’m tired of these DELUSIONAL cowboy fans …Niners are the BEST team in the nfc …yeah I said it …take it to the bank there’s NO WAY the cowboys beat the Niners in week 5😂😂 …mic drop
Bruh, that Dak throw in triple was something else lol
How bout dem cowboys 😂😂😂
Historic defense 😂😂😂
Y’all still them boys?!?! 💀💀
I bet my nephew $10 Dak would throw a pick on that last drive as Tony Pollard kept running and getting 1st downs I thought I would lose because they would stay with the run but as soon as I saw Dakota drop back I knew my money was still good😂😂😂
Talk about a total mental breakdown. That's what happens when you get cocky and think you can't get beat. Quit listening to the hype and play the game.
Looks like Dallas treated this like a playoff game.
12 penalties for 105 that's all I will say
Fly 🦅 Fly
This is why I call them DallASS
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS
How bout them cowboys?  Usually we have to wait till December for them to collapse and choke.   oh well.. Christmas came early this year.  😂😅😂😅
Can someone please say Game Manager? And I'm not talking Dobbs
I’m so confused. Giants beat the cards. Cards beat Dallas. Dallas whooped the giants. What is actually going on 😂
Once again Prescott the hero of the opposition,
We good season ain’t over 😂joke j
Skip gonna lose it tomorrow 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
How Bout Dem Cowboys🤠
This is why I never get my hopes up
Looked like a great game ! I love when the Plowboys lose !
How about them COWGIRLS 😈😈
maybe the diggs injury deflated this team...
Gota say..there were opportunities to score but it seems like if Dallas would have plaid the ball rather then looken for pass interference they would have won the game..play through the defense..thats what I learned long ago.
How can you get beat by a 0-2 team truelly sad
10:40  Dak has 90+ turnovers since entering the league. Another TOP 10 statistic cowboys fans love to ignore 🍿🍿🍿🍿
Well well we'll looks like the Glass Cannon Cowboys crumble again 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  They always look dominant a few times a year only to get choke again again and again
Definitely don’t want to hear no more of that the Cowboys are the team in the NFC to beat talk.
Please Cowboys play like that all the time. it is so enjoyable watch you lose and your fans with 😢 faces
Dobbs doing better than Kyler Murray
As a Giants fan, thank you Cardinals 😭
Where are the cowgirl fans at saying week 3 was a sure win
I like how when the Giants win people say it’s just the cardinals but they beat Dallas, y’all casuals should stop underestimating the cardinals. GO GIANTS
Why didn't they just run d-ball at the endzone this why Ezekiel Elliott was great got us 12 touchdowns last year
shame tht instead of giving the cards credit, espn will just talk about dallas all week
Now we just need the Bucs to blow out the Eagles so we can have a week of upsets
Congrats Cardinals!
The real Dak is back.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Cant wait for first take and stephen A 😂😂😂
Cardinals are “tanking”
I love when the Cowgirls lose with Dak( the pick) Prescott..FLY EAGLES FLY
fking frauds. We know what dak is. Time to get trey lance some reps
And y’all say they can beat the 49ers
As an Eagles fan this made my day the Cowboys never seem to get out of their own way Lmao Stephen A, Chris Broussard are gonna have field days with this Lol!!
Cardinals fan here. No, i didn't think we were tanking. For three games in a row now we've been up going into the 4th quarter. Just didn't know how to close out games. Apparently, we learned. And what better team to do it against lol. My two favorite teams are, the Cardinals, and whoever is playing the Cowboys this week.
Thank god😭 they wouldn’t shut tf up😂😂😂
Embarrassing loss by the Cowboys. No ifs and or buts about it We ain't ready for the SB
They need to hurry up and let go of sorry ahh Dak. All he does is throw picks
How about them cowboys 😅
Dak back to throwing clutch Int's
Allegedly The Greatest Defense Knock It Off With The Shenanigans G 😂😂😂😂😂😂
the "F" game 😅
Apologies to Dobbs, Zack Wilson is sooooooo much worse than you
Love my Cards baby! Whooped Dem boys❤
As a Cowboys fan that lives in AZ, leave it to them to lose a game they should have easily won. I am Salty, but props to the Cardinals for making the Cowboys look like pretenders 😂. I'm not surprised at all. This is nothing new.
hahahahahaha cowboys! seethe and despair! go eagles
HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS😂
If u take away 3 linemen from every team, their quarterback would struggle as well
Cowboys are in playoffs form. 😂
"Still considered to be the best team in the league" ... yet they just gave up 28 points and lost to a no win team. GTFOH with this Cowboy BS we hear every year who always chokes.
Cardinals looked Good! Congratulations on the Win!
Cowboys losing against patriots too
Cowboys should start lance against the 49ers
Cowboy fans last week not giving any credit to the Giants for beating AZ then lose to them… lmao
*laughs in Steven A Smith
Dallas needs to replace Dak.  He can't deliver and is just not good enough.
Elite defense?? 🤡
Hillbillies and losers
The cowboys are still an elite team, I just think they underestimated Arizona. And plus our linemen being out didnt give Dak as much time in the backfield. No excuses for the defensive performance tho
Prescott looks like The Tin Man who forgot to oil his joints. He isn' t all that.
Go VOLS, and go Dobbs!
I don't watch the NFL anymore but I like watching the highlights when the cowboys lose!!
Always a great Sunday when the Cards win one 🎉
DALLAS....THE BIGGEST ABSOLUTE CLOWNS IN THE NFL!! and SO ARE  the REST of you..Media chumps. You dont know SH=T. !!  running your mouths. Acting like you won the SB in week 2 .its a pleasure to watch another classic CHOKE. By the clowns.
Cowboys schedule so far has been way too easy jets giants and cardinals they fans should really chill
How bout them boys now! Hahaha
Cowboys are Cowboying again.
as a 49ers fan i am both happy and concerned cuz we got the cardinals next game and after that we got dallas 😬
What happened to the best defense in the NFL Cowboys what a joke letting the Cardinals run all over you
This is why nobody believes in the cowboys other than idiots
I think the cardinals are better then we taught.
Soon as I heard Dobbs was going to the cardinals.. I said “nah they not tying to tank, dude is a smart baller !”
Next week Arizone KICK extra points.
why dobbs look more like a qb1 than justin fields 😂
How about them COWBOYS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When Dallas loses, America wins 🤣🤣
Dak proves his worth once again. Don’t EVER count on him to put the team on his back, he ain’t got it like that! Everyone, or the media I should say was premature on hyping up the Dallas defense, they’re not as good as everyone thinks, but Parsons is the real deal, just not tonight. Cowboys will go 8-8 this season and that’s coming from me, a Cowboy since 1991.
This is Stephen A's day
dak prescott is overrated
Nothing more satisfying than watching Dallas choke...agian 🤣
yeeeeep...... Kellen Moore was the problem all along. smh
...typical Cowboys ending🙄
Yep....saw this coming....Bring on Trey....like soon...
Dak forgot dallas wears the white jersey when it matters
As Stephen smith would say… Just be patient… They will not let you down… They are an accident waiting to happen 😂
Cowboys didn't play good. But I wonder why they didn't show the long return that was called back due to holding at the line.  Never seen that one called before at that situation.  And wasn't there a 4th and 6.  A 5 yard penalty gave them a first down.   I understand not showing the Cardinals holding in the end zone. That wasn't a highlight but the others?  Even if it would be a safety. And cowboys get the ball.  Dak is back.
But but but the Cowboys beat the Giants 40-0!!!!!!  I thought they were winning 4 Superbowls this year!!!
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!!
*Dak whack Prescott doing what he does best. I’d stop making commercials till you win boy*
Even though they lost, they still have some amazing talent. 10:30 it's plays like that one that makes me admit it. I'm an eagles fan so I'm not afraid to admit the cowboys have a super bowl roster. They do have injuries but they're still capable. Only time will tell.  Go birds🦅🦅
hahahahahahaahahaaaaaaa
biggest upset
I know Dallas fans are upset but no one should feel as bad about anything today as broncos fans… and Sean Payton… 😂😅😂 They had one helluva day 😂😅😂
Awesome!!!Big Like 💎💪🏽😉
How bout them cowgirls!!!!! Fly Eagles Fly 🦅🏈
The Arizona Cardinals are 1-2🔴⚪️⚫️🐤 Week 4 at 49ers
I’m ready for Stephen A. come tomorrow morning. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Howabout them COWGIRLS BEATING SHITTY TEAMS AND GO OVERHYPED ABOUT SUPERBOWL IN SETEMBER HAHAHA
Now buy them a nice work out gym Arizona
Boii undisputed will be live tomorrow
The universe is in harmony when the cowboys disappoint
I’m a lions fan, but I think we can all agree that when the cowgirls lose, Americans win
That's a helluva win for the Cardinals.  They are better than I would have ever expected.   o
Stop listening to Skip Bayless & Michael Irving. I know, I know, Cowboys will win the Superbowl in 2024. 😂😂😂
this is truly the worst game i have ever seen cowboys played the worst game mf didn't cover or Takle such simple tackles.  HIGH schollers couldve made that tackle such a shame from 55 such a bad game can't believe cardinals think they are good. wtf
Don’t know how but cardinals W 🔥‼️
LMAO
Need to use deuce Vaughn more
Cowboys fans, Are Niners still not the team to beat hahaha! Hell this game was not even a divisional game yet cowboys lost to AZ? hahahaha! Here for the excuses and tears!  CANT WAIT TO HEAR SKIP ON HIS VIEWS NOW!!!!!! HE BETTER HAVE SHERM ON THIS COMING MONDAY! HAHAHA!
Well Choke Prescott is still doing his thing.
The Cowboys offense is not very good against teams that can rush the passer!! Dak is soo middle of the pack!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Trade Dak 😊
Cardinals played out of their minds!  Dallas should have won that game.  A few costly break downs and Dak  doing Dak things cost them.  I just don’t see Dallas winning it all with Dak…he always seem to choke when it counts the most.
So funny see people all worked up over the WWE.
The Dalless defans was really good🤣
Nice game from Gallup, he might be his old self again
How about them cowgirls!!!
How bout them cowboys
I think Jerry Jones needs to reiire and let his son hire a young coach to replace Mike McCarty...McCarty is too dull in game time decisions. He is not a very sharp play caller either. He has to let someone else call the plays or just replace him with a younger coach.
But when the giants came back 31-28 on the cardinals “it’s just the cardinals tho!”   Soooo where y’all at?
I don't understand the cards.
Two things - 1) this is the NFL. Regardless of what the media mouthpieces say, you can’t be sleeping on teams in this league 2) game is on the line, time is running out and Dak throws an interception…..again. My my my.
Coming from a Giants Fan, Thank You Cardinals! 👏 This made my Day!
Bad Lost 😂😂😂SMH🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Cowboys fans we don't got a corner they don't got the QB
Haha dallas cowgirls 😂😢😮😅
Cowboys looked like cow 💩 today. 😝
wellp.......Niners can't look at next week's game against the Cardinals as a WARM UP game anymore.
As a giants fan I would make an entire essay on thanking the cardinals but I remembered 2 weeks ago we lost 40-0 so I ain't saying nothing
Every year the cowgirls prove to be fools gold and somehow the Nigerian scam works time and time again on cowboy's fans
Yea, Cowboy fans believe they're going to the SB..until they don't. Same story, again and again and again.
Next year we're going undefeated baby. Cowboys still winning the Superbowl.  Chiefs 6  Cowboys 45 Cowboys will be 16-1
Your team lost to a bottom 3 team in the league, Cowboys fans. Dont talk to us about holding the Giants to less points
I told you. Do not put pressure on Dak. As soon as pressure goes up. You see why, he's a 4th rd pick. And he will lead dallas to their couches for superbowl.
Los vaqueros son un espejismo y su realidad  es la mediocridad.
The Dallas "This is our year" Cowboys everyone.
I just came here to say… hahahahahahahaha…..      Hahahahahahaha     Gannon you are redeemed… for now. -eagles fan
Losing is part of the game but do the Boys have to be unpredictable every year. This was a definite W and they threw it to a poor performing team, as usual. 😐
I’ve never wanted change teams so badly before
I love it
Stephen A Smith getting his  cowboy hat and cigar ready for tomorrow
HOW BOUT THEM CARDINALS?!!
Hahahahahahahahaha yup
Dallas needs to lose Dak.  👎👎
Where was this cardinals in the last two games
Lmao even as a Seahawks fan I still like this! Good job Cardinals!
Its different this year😂😂😂
As a Cowboy fan, congrats to Arizona! Our defense got pushed around and our offense had plenty of opportunities but oh well. Still my team! Go Cowboys!
How about dem GIRLS 😂😂😂😂
Go Cardinals!!! 💪💪 JDub is nice at QB
❤ it ❤ it  when cowgirls lose  ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it  ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it  ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it   ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it   ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it   ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it ❤ it
Cowboys fans after week 2  " We're going to the Super Bowl "
Somebody Dak'd their pants
The “best defense “ and so called “ beat team “ losing to the cardinals is crazy 🥴🫠
Thank you DAK
The Cowboys weren’t ready today.
La constante inconsistencia de Dallas y lo errático de Dakota, un equipo badura.
LMMMAAOOO 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
Was watching and laughing throughout the game!!! Thsnks for the entertainment cowboys and fans.. ya’ll down to earth yet?!?!!!! Beat two mediocre team and though that they’re winning sb already.. while other teams are still working on making themselves better.. they’re going to say its just one game..
Cowboys overlooked them and got caught slipping
Cowboys...................LOL!
The Cowboys coming in without their all pro RG and their C and then losing all Pro LT early, It's a foregone conclusion they were going to lose.
And they think they can beat the 49ers??? 😂😂😂 They have too many chink's in their armor and without ❌.Diggz trouble 😵‍💫
GAME OF THE WEEK 🔥💥
Dak Prescott 😂
The cards aren't my team, but they played a good game, my team will take care of them next week, GO NINERS 😡😡😡!!! AZ Zapata!!!
The weakest link on the cowboys is dak prescott.Dallas will never win a super bowl with him at QB.
ThIs iS ArE YeaR
I guess Parson's couldn't make a difference today.  It took him 4 quarters to get to quarterback.  Awesome.  Nothing is more satisfying than a team talking a whole lot of Sh** getting owned.  Skip Bayless and Michael Irvin, HOW ABOUT THEM COWGIRLS.  OH, YEAH!!!!!!
How about them cowboys lol best team in nfl NOPE most overrated team in nfl is cowboys
When Dallas lose America wins🫡
Far too many pententlies they looked flat in the first qt as well
Cowboys are frauds
As an Eagles fan, I’m proud of Gannon and his utilization of his plays, from Dobbs 43-yard QB run to the consistency of the defense swatting away game-changing plays  Still has a ways to go, but this is a start!
How ‘bout them gayboyssss😂
there may be hope for my team yet!! Go Cardinals!!!
😁
Where all those mouthy cowboy fans now? Oh, they crawled back under their rocks.
If Dobbs keep playing well at quarterback it’s going to be hard for kyler Murray to get his job back.
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS?!
How about them cowboys
Its always "This is our year" until its not 😂
As a Cowboys fan its the same team different year! Its football though!! The game is fun to watch no matter who is playing and its awesome that its spread out throughout the week. Mondays , Thursdays  Sundays give ya something to look forward to!
Not a Cowboys fan but I gotta say, they are better than that.  They were almost dominated.  Coaches should be hanging their heads in shame.  They failed to prepare the team.
Makes me happy seeing Dobbs ball out
Thank you cardinals ! From a Redskins fan.
such low quality for an nfl vid
I've been a cowboys fan since '79 and I've been saying this ever since we won that last super bowl or were given that super bowl by Neil oDonald we will not win anything while Jerry Jones owns and runs the team. End of story. Dak is not a good quarterback he has settled for at least 10 field goals in the red zone in the last couple of games that is not a super bowl quarterback.
As a Cardinals fan, I don't know how to feel except, I still don't like Dallas.
We da biggest bird
Two easy weeks for the 49ers Cards gets it first and then them cowgirls 🎉 🎊
The Cowboys made Dobbs look like Lamar
Cowboys not getting to be 3-0 is so nice to see
The Cowboys are so overrated.
How bout that Texas Toast Offense w/ Wak Prescott leading America's team. 🙆🏼‍♀️
For me, I'm just waiting for the 'F game' conversation on First Things First on Monday
How about them cowboys 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Too many adds .....
I love how they played hey jealousy
Take a bow
Reality check for those Cowgirls fans. What you saw today is what you will get for the rest of this season.
SMH, this one is on Dak! The Cowboys were in the redzone like 5 times and came away with 2 fgs! He couldn't produce today.
Thank you cardinals   -the real america
Same old dak. I would definitely rather have purdy or CJ then Dak lol
as a giants fan, couldn’t have asked for a better finish to my day.
The Cowgirls in mid season form already 😂
They beat the Giants and Jets 😂 Every Cowboy fan had them winning the Super Bowl delusional is an understatement
Dak is back!!! Hahahahaha
If Murray comes back in time, could they make the playoffs?
Josh dobbs GBO
Big time rigging
Here is the the cowboys we know and love 😂😂😂😂😂
"THEY WERE, WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE!" - Coach Dennis Green. RIP
I thought they were playing in Dallas. No love for the Cardinals in zona
Cowboy at it again.
It's basically a routine for the Cowboys. Once Dak turns over the football, it's over for the Cowboys.
wheres the guy who said they have the best defense ever after a jets win 🤡🤣
Monday: Skip Bayless "My cowboys will destroy 49ers!! on week 5!!!"
AINT NO WAY!!! THEY JUST GOT DUSTED BY THE WORST TEAM IN FOOTBALL!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂!!!
Prescott has got to go! Dallas will never win anything with that overrated loser!
The amount of survival pools that went up in flames from this game is crazy. Clearly the boys on Dallas went out on Saturday and had a time.
The cowgirls lay and egg, no way they're going to beat the mighty Niners the way they played today. Good luck next time.
Still love how cowboys fans are everywhere like your still playing in there stadium. Congrats on win cardinals
Lmao so much for that “amazing” Cowboys team. Pretenders as always.
How Bout them....Cardinals?
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS!!
My Vikings loss was sad but this is hysterical 🤣
and they tried to make the argument that COWBOYS over NINERS ... pffft, the COWGIRLS can't even beat our division team.
So satisfying!! Go Niners!!😂😂
HOW BOUT DEM CARDINALS! #FlyhighRedSea
Love seeing these so called top teams lose! My Bucs vs Eagles for top team in NFC with the niners
We gave Dak all this money and he CANNOT convert in the red zone. 🤦🏾‍♀️We held on to Romo to long and we gonna do the same with Dak. 🤷🏾‍♀️
It gives me joy to watch the goatropers lose, and great joy listening to goatroper fans whine.
Gotta leave it up to the cowboys to do what the cowboys do best
Thanks to the referees 15 flags wow any lil thing to make use lose cause they had 2 losses
My man said, "Jitter Bug" 😅
What
What happened to run defense this game?
Same story when the team need must Dak  is shocking 🤦🤦🤦
People act like cards are bad or something
Now can all this Super Bowl talk about the Cowboys cease. Them boyz got took down by the lowly deficient Cardinals. They not scaring nobody.
Chris Broussard F GAME
I don’t want to talk about it y’all can laugh and clown me all tf y’all want
I'm ashamed to be a Dallas Cowboys fan after this game...
Cowboys are no match for Dobbs!
HAHAHAHAHAHA... HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.. HHHHAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYSSSSSSSS
I hope the cowboys have a good regular season so they cry even harder when the playoffs come
Let’s go cards! 🐦 🔴
Lol.      So much for that Dallas defense.    Lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂and offense sucked like always.
Watching Dallas lose never gets old even if Gannon has to be the beneficiary.
Jerrah has bamboozled Cowboys fans out of 10 billion dollar's.
Just be patient 🤠😂
don’t blame it on t diggs being out either. t diggs ain’t the run defense.
McCarthy = Schmuck! Dak = 2X Schmuck!! Jerry=====?!@#%!!
Cowboys vs Broncos Super Bowl???? Idk who to choose 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Put in trey lance already
GO CARDINALS YALL STILL DEM BOYS😂😂
Cooper Rush for red zone plays...not Dak
Can’t wait for Skip’s reaction😂😂😂😂
Cowboys doing what they do Best 😂😂😂😂😂 so satisfying....ohhh my god them boys 😂😂😂
In typical Cowboys fashion. It is so hard to be a Cowboys fan
THE DALLAS COWBOYS ARE THE WORST TEAM IN THE NFL BECAUSE THEY LOST TO THE WORST TEAM IN THE NFL
Dallas should have run the ball more. Defense was exposed like they were last year.
NEW POWER RANKINGS!!!  32: Cowboys 31: Bears  30: Broncos 29: Giants
Prescott is the worst!!!!
Dak returning to post season form I love it.
Dobbs might turn out to be good....
Im so glad they lost sick of the bragging 🤪
Como siempre dark haces de las tuyas. Siempre desepcionas a los aficionados de los vaqueros
😂 lol Stephen A tomorrow with his cowboy hat and a cigar
This was a pathetic showing
When you underestimate your opponent, you get burned.
Not sure where the Cowboys defense was from the first two weeks but they sure as hell didn't show up today
Backup Dak will always have the deer in the headlights look in key moments of any game. The coach is a DA for not using both running backs more and a stupid go for it on 4th down. Dallas looks like who they always are, mediocre at best. They need a real CB also
Giants lose Commanders lose Dallas lose  Eagles..... loading
Stephen A Smith ready to go crazy tomorrow on First Take
Thats the dallas way , they win over bad teams and fire up 🔥  and lost againt elite teams 😂😂
Yea wait until Philly gets to Dallas !!!!! Aj & Davonte smith will feast !!!!!
Once the cowboy play a physical defense there a different team, they got punch in the mouth.
Dak is no Goff.
Well, well well…..
NEW SYSTEM, NEW CARDINALS!!!
It's always the games that are "easy" for the cowboys that they ALWAYS lose 🤣🤣 as a cowboys fan I'm glad I didn't watch the game😮‍💨
Lol let’s go Dallas 😂
I can't wait to see SKIPS and MICHAEL IRVINS face tomorrow morning on Undisputed. LMBO!! Stephen A. Smith and Shannon Sharpe are going to have a field day tomorrow on First Take!! LOL How bout dem Cowboys!! LOL
As a Niners fan I'm going to miss Shannon all over Skiiiip
Great win my Arizona!
And they got some nerve talking about Dallas is better than the 49ers, lmao 😂
Dak mvp you did good defense let us down !
Whak Prescott shows up again
Yup. Cowboys came back to earth. Diggs really does shut down one side of the field and dak throws picks.
Everyone: "Cardinals are tanking!"  Cardinals: You're welcome, America.
What happened to all the hype about Cowboys? FINS scored 70 today
Cowboys fan said we have the best defense 😂😂😂😂 last week.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
First Take in the house
How the Giants come back down 21 but the Cowboys couldn’t come back down 12 😂. 1 reason Daniel Jones > Dak  🤷🏻‍♂️
As a pitt fan. It's heartwarming seeing Connor and Dobbs ball out man 🙏
Vegas took alot of people money  alot  people  betted on the cowboys to win this win 😂 i win so money  today 😀
love a cowboys loss ❤ thanks Arizona
WTF???? I was told the Cowboy's are the bomb
Aye they had to be the team to lose 😂
Tha ahit was inexcusable
Faaaaaaakkk!!!
as a cowboys fan i can confirm that we were cheated mica was held in the end zone and they did not give us a safety and plus Gallup got pi no called
Cowboys are always who we think they are, awful!  🤣
The patriots defense is better then the cardinals defense haha as an eagles fan this was awesome cry cowgirls cry 😂😂😂
Superbowl bound! Take a BOW!
Smoking on the cowboys pack sheeesh 😊
red zone offense is HORRIBLE!
No run defense
Cowboys' fans tonight: The Cardinals are title contenders 😂
Not taking the 3 points down by 8 in the 3rd quarter is mind boggling
News Flash from Dallas: Prescott to be benched? WOW
Cardinals have a good defense, but if the Cowboys can’t beat the Cardinals they ain’t making a run.
So much about America team..or better yet America looser team
*Accident, accident, accident waiting to happen!*
The cardinals did America a great service today. To cowgirl fans how do you lose to the angry birds.
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS!
Can't WAIT for Undisputed lmao
SAS and Sherm about to have feasts this week
JimmyJohnson HELP.
A $$$ grab...
Dak 😅😅😅
"NFL put on notice", Micah Parsons.  Enjoy dink and dunk "Dak" for hopefully another extension, Micah. HaHa
First take gonna be funny asf
As a cowboys fan good game Cardinals And This hurts so much.💔
Sad sapps
I don't understand.....how do you let the back up QB and his buddies run all over you? I don't even know what to say.
I wanna hear Skip's taje on this one lol! Can't wait!!!!
so they lost to the cardinals, eh?  cowboys = PRETENDERS!!
What happened to crashing for Caleb?
Until all the cowboy fans that Saw super bowl 30, once you all go to heaven or hell, then the Cowboys will decide, "should we or shouldn't we reach the NFC title game?"  Y so serious 😈🥃🃏
Wait… I thought the Cardinals were tanking? That’s what social media said for the last two weeks and to not be proud of the Giants comeback.
Same ol cowboys!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Keep that same energy too! We don’t wanna hear any excuses! The Cowboys are a joke 😂
i dont think i cheered for the eagles more then i wanted to see dem boys lose
Remember when cowboy fans tried to compare Josh Allen to Dak? This cowboy hater does😂😂😂😂
As a 49ers fan I couldn’t be happier…. The cardinals winning enough games will prevent them from getting top 3 quarterback in the draft… and most importantly, the cowboys lose.
Im just here for the comments 😂
So beautiful.Cowgirls lose🤣🤣
Cowgirls mad af. 😅
How the Redskins and Giants beat the Cardinals yet, Cowboys being the number one of the division couldn't beat them? Football is so unexpected lol
Both cowboys lost this wknd....Deon and Dallas nalgas!
THE COWBOYS AND THEIR  SELF- DESTRUCTIVE PENALTIES, MAY NOT EVEN MAKE THE PLAYOFFS  🏈💯
No matter how bad a team is the players are never tanking they will always go out the to win good game for the cards
Once again dak can not get it done. Hes thrown a wooping zero td's to wr this season. As you can see throws a pick into triple coverage in the redzone. He's not the guy that wins a sb for dallas.
Keyshawn put his mouth on deez Cowboys 😅🍻🍺
Just checking to see if y’all still dem boyz
Still sure it's yall year?
Well it looks like no SB talk this week......
The Cardinals have been WAY more competitive than I thought they would be before the season.
The Cowboys never disappoint. We got high hopes. We got high hopes.
as an eagles fan I'm glad the cowboys lost
Yeehah!!!!
Trashcott is so predictably bad
Wohooo, Dak 'the walking interception' did it again! I love this guy😊 How bout dem Cowgirls?
They'll blow out bad and injured teams then talk SB contention but when they lose to one of the worst teams in the league they cant stop talking about injuries lmao
Reminder any given Sunday you can lose! No NFL team is just gon to lay down and let you run them over !
How bout dem trashcans!
NoooooGod why have you funsaken the American Team COWBOYS!!!!
How bout them cowboys
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣best defense 🤥🤥🤥🤥
Cardinals might not be the 32nd team, to build a big lead last week and now this one.
Every year,, every one boards the hype train.. Best defense? Lol.. Best qb in nfc? Lol
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭. No way the boys lost 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm not stunned at all. This is par for the course for the Cowboys, which is why it's so infuriating as a fan. They'll have a couple good weeks, then fall apart against a team they have no business losing against.
Still want my team to tank, but if there's any team in the NFL that I love to see lose is the Dallas cowgirls

Cowboys Fans Literally Every Year: “This is OUR year. We are loaded. We are going to win the SUPER BOWL!”   Cowboys Every Year: *Proceeds To Lose Games To Mediocre Opponents*
I can't WAIT for Shannon & Stephen A tomorrow
Better than my 9ers huh 😂😂😂lmao .
Haven’t even hit play and I bet Dak loses this game
Imagine giving a team that was projected to be the worst this season their first win.  HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS?!
Yeah and they think they can just walk into Santa Clara and compete against the 49ers who are undefeated and have beat them twice back to back years smh 😂
Just a WILD DAY of football, Cards have actually looked pretty solid with Dobbs, they aren’t the broncos or bears
🩸🌊
Maybe the Cowboys are tanking for Caleb Williams? 😂
The Cowboys have now lost seven out of their last eight meetings to the Cardinals. Pathetic.
The Cardinals never got the Tanking memo. Great running scheme by Gannon. Dak being Dak was the final straw. I was told Dallas is the best team in the NFL. What happened?
not surprised seeing how the cardinals played the giants
love it 😂
Fck Caleb Williams, I want the playoffs 🗣🔥 #getwellsoonk1
McCarthy ain’t no better than Moore. Bland predictable offense and then the QB gets blame. With an OC like Reid Shanahan or Payton this team would be fire.
Jon Gannon has the Cardinals playing some hard nosed football for a team that was supposed to be awful.
No the hell you didn't, Dallas.  No you didn't just lose in Arizona... 🤣🤣...Commanders beat them, Giants came back and beat them.  How y'all lost this game?!
Wow.... as an Eagles fan just seeing the Giants, REDSKINS, and cowboys lose makes everything just a little bit better 😂😂
I may owe my brother-in-law an apology for mocking his "the NFL is scripted" comment.
we’ll be okay , fluke game. refs were bad, nd so was our play calling nd defense was way worse than the last 2 weeks , we’ll be back to normal for new england 👌🏼
So happy the Cowgirls lost tonight
this is a one time thing i assure you a lot of our key pieces weren’t there on both sides and so was our morale this will be a long week to change what needs to be changed and get our things together cowboys are better than this who we saw today wasn’t them
Stephen A : Cowboys  Shannon S:  Broncos  Great Monday everyone 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂!!!! Typical cowgirls.
Cry cowboys f.u
Stephen a is going have field day
Please stop comparing the cowboys defense to the 85 bears.  Looks like the cowboys defense for the last 27 years.  Suspect
I see my team beat them. Cowboys after me winning the special Olympics six times man. Cowboys more like cow sucky
Biggest upset in while
Can’t wait until Monday and watch Stephen A Smith. 😂
America's team?? The best defense?? Lose to the Cardinals with a backup that outplayed Dak. No excuses delusional Trashboys fans  🤫🤣
This cowboys defense will never be the same without Trevon Diggs, I hope we do better next week
As a cowboy fan🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Cant wait to hear comments from Jerry the joke Jones 😂
Yankees got eliminated from making the playoffs, and the cowboys got embarrassed by the freaking cardinals. What a huge win for America
BuT ThE CoWbOyS BeAt ThE gIaNtS 40-0 🥴
As a certified Cowboys hater this was a very fun game and Dak did what Dak does.... throw picks when the game is on the line.
Wowwwwwww didn't see that happening... Cowboys messing up my football pool... of course it had to be them losing to the Cardinals...😂😂😂😂😂
I guess the old cowboys show up again as they always have since the late 90’s where they can’t score in the red zone. The darling cowboys that some media had already gave the flower to go to the super bowl this season didn’t show up against the tanking cardinals for caleb Williams. 😅
I wonder if we’ll get an F Game rant from Chris Broussard 😂😂😂
How about dem boys??
weird. I can't watch the video. Jerry must not want us to see
Always a good day when the Dallas Cowbillies lose!!! Same old Cowbillies!!!
Cowboys fans excuses incoming…
Jimmy Johnson would have never lost to a team that was underdog
As an Eagles fan it warms my heart when stuff like this happens
I'm concerned for the 49ers next week. The Cards looked tough and now they got some momentum going with this win
Where are the cowgirl fans at??? Talking about how the cowgirls are the best team in the NFC??? Y'all mfs know its the 49ers!! Dak is wack!!
Well, that was fun as a SF fan.  Dak threw his  red zone interception.   Cowboys were 2-0 against the bad giants and jets.  I wouldn't punch that superbowl ticket.  The 49er defense is coming for you. 😂
Typical fraudulent Cowboys lmao
Joe Davis
Any given Sunday
The reffs are paid off!
Anyone who said they saw this one coming is probably lying. I gotta say, though. The Cardinals may not be the worst team in the league, after all. They may be short of talent, but you know what they do have? Heart. They seem to have a culture change after firing Kliff Kingsbury. They also easily could be 3-0. That's crazy to say. I'm just happy for the Cardinals. And more so happy for Head Coach Jonathan Gannon. They remind me of the 2021 Lions. I'm losing a bunch of games but never losing heart.
Cowboy’s lose to back of the back ups 🤣🤣🤣
People laughing but the cardinals have been competitive in every game they played.
Lmao! Never change, Dallas! Never change! 😂
" Daks all folks "
Good to see Dallas already in Divisional Round form
Philly running for 400
Daniel Jones led Giants put 31 points against the Cardinals… Dak Prescott led Cowboys got half that 😭😭😭💀
Of course the Cowboys would lose to a bad team. Some things never change.😂
At least the cowboys weren’t healthy today when they lost so it should change when they get healthy
SKIYYYYUUUP!
Just checking to see if y'all still Dem Boyz...🥳 it’s here again
AMERICA WINS WHEN THE COWBOYS LOSE!!! THE COWBOYS FIND A WAY TO LOSE AND WE LOVE IT!!!
Imagine getting punched in the mouth by the 0-2 Cardinals ?? Oh and the usual red zone pick by Dak 🤣
Just be patient, the Cowboys are allergic to prosperity 😂
Cowboys and Colorado both got exposed this weekend.
HOW BOUT THEM COWGIRLS! Losing to the worst team in the league 😂😂😂
LMFAO! Here we go again😅
Dak saw those Red Jerseys and thought he was playing the Niners.
That Rondale Moore TD looked real Deebo-esque.. Shanahan is out here creating trends in the league. 👌🏾
“What can go wrong, will go wrong”
Cowboys going to the Super Bowl.. HA, ain’t even going to Tecmo Bowl ….
Gotta say, the Cardinals sure look good for the team everyone was certain was gonna be an egregious tank job this season.
thats funny
Ok the Cowboys are NOT ready for the 9ers…..No Way!!!!
Thank you, Cowgirls. Completed my winning parlay with your embarrassing loss.
As a proud hater of the cowboys good W for cardinals
Hahaha it happens every season
Hahaha not on the 49ers level, allowing the Cardinals to 28 points 😂 I thought the defense was as good as the the 49ers? 😂
I enjoyed every single second of this L them boys caught
How bout them cowcakes!
Can't stand C Boys!
All you Cowboys fans said you had the best defense in the league 😂😂😂. I said it once and I’ll say it again, Cowboys always choke, and it starts now.
Lol espn gonna be lit
Yeeeeeeeeeee Haaaaaawwwww🤣🤣🤣🤣
Any given Sunday…………
We live in the reality where the 2023 cowboys who are hyped to the moon and back to be a Super Bowl contender just lost to the 2023 Arizona cardinals.   Thought the cardinals were supposed to be tanking? And you just let THEM win their only game so far? Of all the NFC East teams they played and lost to it was the COWBOYS who they beat?  Sometimes the more things change the more they stay the same. Congratulations Dallas and cowgirls fans you earned this one. 😏🤣😂
The worst teams first win is against the the best team
I'm curious to see the power rankings, fan reactions and most importantly, Stephen A. Smith tomorrow 👀😂🤣
Pretenders as always
and just like that we’re back in the regular season
“Patience” - Stephen A   😂😂😂😂
Yeah... That's the Cowboys we know n love to laugh at.
Absolutely embarrassed by the winless Cards….  Honestly us Cowboy fans got everything we deserved by buying into the BS every time! You know it! You can already feel it in your guts, If they even make the playoffs it will be another early exit.
AND THAT’S THE BOTTOM LINE CAUSE JONATHAN GANNON SAID SO ❗️❗️
Stephen A gonna have a field day  🤠
As a cowboys fan, I am mad about this lost but I’m also glad they did. They need to stop sleeping on these teams. This is what they deserve. It’s also the coaches fault for not preparing them. Next week, they better not sleep on the pats. Gg cardinals! Y’all did well.
The Arizona Cardinals have stunned everybody by beating the team that have been saying is their year for the past 26 years now, The Cowgirls. Congrats Cards great win, the third time in a row you beat the cowgirls.
Ya what happened to the Super Bowl cowboys ?  Just a preview of the post season.
As a diehard Niners fan whose next 2 matchups are these 2 teams…. I can’t wait to hear what they say about this 😂😅 Congrats AZ
Being a washington fan i was incredibly disappointed in my team today but i get happy watching the cowboys lose.
Remember when cowboys fans said they’re winning the SB after being Zach Wilson?? 🤣🤣💀💀
Remember when people crapped on the Commanders and especially the Giants(with Danny Dimes throwing FOUR STRAIGHT TDs against them) for barely beating a “tanking” cardinals team? Cowboys, where y’all at?😂😂😂
LMAO not surprised it's the cowgirls all that hype they never learn to STFU and be humble😂😂😂😂
I didn't expect this to be a trap game for the cowboys smh, props to Josh dobbs tho, for leading this team to a W
If Dallas struggled against the Cardinals defense all game, imagine them against the 49ers defense in two weeks…
Any team can beat the jets and giants by 40, the cowboys defense is the most overrated unit in nfl history 😂😂😂😂
Can’t wait till mccaffrey and Deebo runn all over them ‼️😈
Cards have beaten the Cowboys 7 of the last 8 times played
the cardinals have beaten the cowboys in 7 of the last 8 meetings
This is what the Cowboys get after they keep saying they are the #1 best team in the League
Giants fan. Thank you Cardinals.
When the cowgirls lose *AMERICA WINS!*
Watching the live stream chat in this game was hilarious, Cowboys fans went from super arrogant, saying Super Bowl win was a lock to saying fire McCarthy, trade Dak and tank for Williams! LOL.
I don’t think the Cowboys took this game serious.  I have been extremely disappointed with the Cardinals this off season and the first two games.  Tanking comes to mind and I would have bet they would have blown this one too.  Cardinals should be 3-0
Pats next week, then the 9ers. Wooooo! Guys could be sub .500 real quick.  You know, even though the 9ers hung 30 on NY, I thought they played kinda sloppy.   If this is what Dallas rolls into Santa Clara, y'all better just stay on the buss.
Same ol story every year about the Cowboys. We are going to the Superbowl and play like this. Lol
O V E R R A T E D 😭😂🤣
10 points in 2 weeks to 28 points I guess Diggs was a bigger lost than expected.
This was a good loss for the Cowboys. We get to see Shannon & Stephen A go off tomorrow!
James Conner played as if America depended on him - to extinguish the team that claims to be America's team.
Aww what happened to the “best team in the league” 😂😂😂 Niners on top
We don't need to win them all until the playoff season hits. It's still our year!
GO CARDINALSSSSAS
As a Washington fan this game made me smile
And vintage pick throwing Prescott is back 😂😂😂😂😂😂
When the Cowboys lose, America wins!
This teams better than the niners?! Lol… Dak gonna Dak…😂😂
Cards went broke back and decided to F them some cowboys
Haha😢😢😢😢 he choked I wonder who he reminds me of😂😂😂😂😂
Thank you Arizona Cardinals for ignoring your tank for one week so that you could make the entire world laugh so hard at the Dallas Cowboys 😂😂
As always…Cowboys lose everyone else wins 😂
Cowboy fans talking crazy about the Niners just to go out and lose to the worst team in the Niners division.
How bout them cowboys, Ahaha hahaha, aw what happened cowboys? Card caught your tongue. Cowboys always find a way to lose. Plus what about that interception. What can go wrong will go wrong.
I knew the Cowboys run was a fluke.
This video has been such an inspiration and made my life better.
Just in time for Halloween Dak has turned back into his old pumpkin form 🎃 many more INTs to come. If you think about it Dak hasn’t won a game all year, his defense and special teams has but not him, look what happens when they have to rely on him.
Please never change cowboy fans. Yall make these losses so satisfying.
Stephen A is going to have a field day tomorrow! Sadly Shannon won’t be in a good mood because his team gave up 70 points!
The cowboys are the worst team in the nfl 😂😂😂😂 IMAGINE LOSING TO A TEAM WHOS ACTIVELY TRYING TO LOSE AS HARD AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lamb lost me 800 bucks for not getting 18 yards…
This was our year 😭
Cowboys are back baby
I thought their preseason powr ranking 6 was crazy. I had them at 12.
Losing to the cardinals by double digits is crazzzyyyyy 💀
Hope we win tomorrow night against TB 👀
Bruh I heard so many cowboy fans talkin today but let’s be real.. 😂
Jerry,   please give dink and dunk "Dak" another extension. PLEASE
What can go wrong will go wrong🤣😂
As a cowboys fan, I’m currently planning a romantic dinner date with a double barrel shotgun tonight 🌹
Dak gotta go😂 plz trade this man, I’ll take anyone over him at this point.
Stephen A. Smith is going to have a field day tomorrow on first take. The Cowboys got caught sleepwalking their way through this game, and it showed there in the the desert.
LOL. HAHAHAH. LOL !!!!
Hey Cowboys fans, go back to talking about that 40-0 win over the giants. It was a happier time for you 🤣🤣
Moment of Silence for Cowboys fans thinking it was their year…….
AS A COWBOYS FAN, THIS SEASON IS OVER 😭
Outscoring both new york teams 70-10 and then getting destroyed by the worst team in the league is the most Cowboys thing ever
What can go wrong, will go wrong.
What a week for upsets and destruction. First, we got the Dolphins 70-20, the Colts upsetting Lamar in overtime, Texans destroying the Jaguars, and now we got this.
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS!!!
SUPER BOWL XLIII RUNNER-UP ARIZONA CARDINALS WINNER: WEEK 3
Cowboys fans thought they had the Super Bowl wrapped up. Back to the drawing board boys.
Dobbs > Dak 😂
Yeah Dallas ain’t beating New England 😂
I never wanna hear cowboys hype ever again. They know their identity they just won’t admit it. NINERS ON TOP
Dallas cowgirls what happened
Excellent first career win for rookie HC Gannon. We beat the Cowboys in 2020, 2021 and 2023 #RiseUpRedSea
Cowboys logic: Steamroll bad Teams and Get blown out by some other random bad team.
Lmao Cowboys. 😂💀
Tomorrow is gonna be like Christmas Morning for Stephen A and Shannon 😂. Hoooow Do?!?!?
Cardinals feel so bad for Bears that decided to give them Caleb Williams
First off, why are people overestimated Dallas beating Arizona when Arizona has always had Cowboys since 2008? That was totally unacceptable to act like Cardinals owning cowboys now weren’t existed. Well, Dallas is now 1-7 against Arizona since 2008. It is called Phoenix owning Dallas
LETS GO BIRDS 🦅 COWBOYSK
Makes me feel better about losing to the literal colts
The Cowboys looked unstoppable for the first two weeks and now against one of the worst teams in the league, they do this.  I’m stunned.  Edit: This is clearly sarcasm. Cowboys are the Cowboys lol
Crazy how the cowboys were supposed to be a good team but fumble to the cardinals of all teams 😂
i think the cardinals are forgetting to tank
First
How do you lose to the cardinals?💀
Fraudulent Cowboys L
Cowboys doing cowboy things
Clearly shows you that the 49ers are way better than the cowboys.
😂😂😂
Pls pin 5th
The sorry cowboys once again 😔
First?
Classic
Okay haters, I'm here for all the smoke. "one and done. 30 years." Congrats to Arizona. No excuses they had starters out too. GG ❤
1st
Bro is this the real Cowboys? These are Cowgirls man not boys 😂
Cowboys really lost to the cardinals 🥹
COWGIRLS WHAT HAPPENED, IS IT STILL YOUR YEAR?
As a commanders fan,this just fully redeemed my day
Your video made me smile.😘
Hey look it’s the team that lost to the Cardinals 😂😂😂😂
This was such a typical cowboys loss.
