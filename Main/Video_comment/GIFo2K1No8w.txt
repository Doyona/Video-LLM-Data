The freestyle at the end of aint it different 🔥
Bro I am 10 and I love you
One Of The Best Brits Performance Ever 🤩
I'm just here for this impressive epic camera direction! Plus they used a cinebot camera used a lot in adverts and at the Oscars - but the big deal is this was the first time ever used on live TV, a big undertaking! This is how they did it: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2Jf_Lp7lxak
Fire shots
Fire
Blacks are important
Luv headie One rich uncle dances😄
That sweatsuit Headie One is wearing is tuff
Can someone please deliver each song? This mix is sick! Shorty needs assistance
Headie stay steadie
At one point I didn't like British Rap. But its moved on so much, the young rappers are killing it, their flow, their lyrics and their confidence is brilliant.
Ngl this should be released on Apple Music
what a difference autotune makes...
Headie one: ain't it different, digestive biscuits Camera: ➡ ↗️⬆️↘️↪️↙️⤵️↙️⬅️
I keep watching this on repeat. I loved the performance and the powerful message when Headie and AJ were paying homage to NHS keyworkers, Marcus Rashford, identity and his (Headie One) tribulation.
Let's give this song the ting it deserves out of every ting this is the ting that makes the camera ting
0:44 😮‍💨
One of the only rappers I see actually just using vocals no backing tracks
Epic camera work
I’m so proud 🥲
Camera work reminds me of that video camera in Kendrick lamars humble
The aquatic wood objectively step because babies analogously lie midst a warlike shorts. reflective, hungry news
LETS GOOO AJ
Young t and bugsy are soo happy
Honestly this song has really out done itself, I listened to this maybe more than 100 times. What u think guys, do u agree? Leave a reply about your opinion 😊
Nice to see this song with a Nice camera man
So hard tbh camera and the man himself including Aj and the Mandem
Is see AJ I click
Aldem man fantastic ♥
headie one cant sing ngl aj tracey and bugsey and that legit carried him with this all headie does is mumble so as aj tracey saids FACTS!
Ironically, Headie's summoning his forefathers at 4.20. The powers!
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Headie is so overrated he’s so boring
Your phone's whack ass  speaker won't do the audio justice, listen on something BIG!.
Headieee❤️❤️❤️
Headies been on the scrambled egg with toast that he wished he could have
The camera movement though 👀😵
Headie a troll fr
ON POINT!! 🔥
How’s my man out of breath🤣🤣🤣
How bad is headie without auto tune😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who t f are these people?
Suh Suh

Why are there only 9 comments?
Uno when how the camera moving mad. Why do i feel like headie cant keep up with that shit😂😂
headie goofy one
Everyone here for the dance 😂
#aj tracey
Young T and Bugsey are good but absolutely trash live. Factual statement.

For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
Headie One doesn't get enough recognition for his talent in my opinion. One of the best Grime artists
Virgil designed the trackie
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Fuegooo!!!
Govi said eat out to help out but won't help rashford when he's feeding the yutes.
Got the Kendrick camera angles
He's gawjus 😍 him. 💙From Liverpool

Just a friendly message not related to this video ☺️ God loves you, no matter who you are, where you’re from or what you’ve done. He’s waiting with open arms for you to accept Him into your lives. Please repent of your sins and ask God for forgiveness. He loves and cares for you. Jesus has already paid the price for all of our sins, you just need to believe in Him that he’s our saviour and begin to live right with God. I love you and hope you have a lovely day. God Bless You☁️🙌
Yes now This is real black rapping love from italy fans 🇮🇹

4:19 😂
If this was a music video we would be raving about the creativity, $#!+ was live! LIVE!....
This camera work is phenomenal
more plaques for the critics comee onnnnm
2 things would have made this perfection - stormzy on ain't it different, and for young t and bugsy to have performed don't rush too ☺  still best of the night in my opinion!
The musics good but it sounds like he’s rapping into a mic in a large empty room
whoever directed this deserves a raise. this some creative shit
Headie should just spit laying down, he’s that laid back it’s mad 😂
He is terrible. Keep him off stage. Young T and Bugsey were great though.
Absolute garbage!
Powerful.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Headie a superstar!
lyrically inept

Free Palestine 🇵🇸

I barley listen to these types of music but the lyrics changed my mind 😌🥴
It’s mad how much auto tune goes in to one tune
Headie came from letting it off in the uni room to securing a whine on the Brit awards
🔥🔥
Incredible show of British talent
Camerawork CRAZYY
🔥🔥
❤
The best part is that Headie is actually looking happy 😌🙌🏼
𝕄𝕒𝕘𝕚𝕔𝕒𝕝𝕝𝕪 𝔻𝕠𝕡𝕖.
The camera work and background art is sick as fuck. Not to mention the rapping is cold as
Dope
Strormzy no where to be found in these live perfs for his features :(
Powerful statement at the start. The backdrop and camera movement was A1. The transition into AJ's entrance was so cold. The new verse they added addressing the politics was a nice addition. Good to see Headie having fun at the end as well.
This bangs 😨😨
Absolutley banging performance
After this performance the weekend should really be thinking about getting his 7 mil he paid for the super bowl 😂😂
https://youtu.be/pnSdpEqWILI
Brits was so dead
That camera is sick🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Onee!!
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins

I love J Hus but I gotta say I reckon Headie deserved artist of the year. His rise from drillers x trappers to going number 1 with Edna is incredible. He’s helped bring drill to the mainstream.
The government say eat out to help out but won’t help Rashford when he’s feeding the youtes 👏🏻
From the streets to the brits👑
