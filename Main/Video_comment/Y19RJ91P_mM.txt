OKAY HEAR ME OUT.  “Strike Force Five Wars”  Just reenact scenes from Star Wars Episode 4, but with the guys.  Luke - Jimmy Fallon Obi Wan - Colbert Han - Seth C3PO - I mean we already know, don’t we? …that leaves Kimmel as Chewbacca, I mean it just writes itself. (Unless you can pull Conan to be Chewie, think HAIR…then Kimmel is Leia 😅)  Have Guillermo play R2D2 Have Letterman as Vader John Stewart needs to cameo as the Emperor.  PLEASE DO THIS.  PLEASE!!!
late night talk shows are sh1t.  awful. and fk all those money hunger people.  they want money for stuff that they did 10 years ago.  FK EXECUTIVES. normal people can't empathize with them AT ALL"!!! They charge too much for what they worth. That's why for me it is better to strike on my own using torrents and parallel streaming webpages.
YESSSSSSSSSSSS! Let the jackaling begin!!!
"Dear NBC/Universal/Comcast/monster-conglomerate: thank you so much for throwing us enough crumbs to live. It was very compassionate of you to finally pay us a living wage after years of exploiting our hard work to enrich yourselves and your shareholders. There definitely won't have to be yet another writer's strike like the last two in ANOTHER 10-15 years. I just love working for this 'corporate personhood' that treats me like family... except when they don't."

damn, I was really hoping the strike would last forever.  sucks that the show is back
Nice video
Good
Nice talk
Good
I didn't even know they were on strike.
Although I'm happy for them to get back to work, I wish the strike would have gone on for  longer because I wanted the podcast to continue. The podcast was so funny especially because they don't have to pander to the audience and more importantly, there's no audience.

Welcome back! We missed all the people involved in creating these wonderful shows.

Wow it is nice and enjoy ful
I love Seth and missed the show
Classy touch Seth!
5 months was so long, especially with all the political crap that went down!

Welcome  thank you for sticking with your writer's and supporting their struggle.
Nice 👍

💚💚💚💚
Actors on strike and who cares? It's back to work for Late Night. Too bad actors.
CLASSY TOUCH SETH
I'm sorry, we're you gone for a while ? 😄😄😄😄😄🙃😄🙃.... No,  seriously... thank God you're back... I was considering a facial tattoo to break the monotony 🤳😳😳😳🎩
Super video
My life went into disarray because of the strike. I missed my daily late night funny news. This is how I know what day it is.
amazing video
Very good
Vary vary nice I like
Grateful to have you back.
The guys in the booth really missed an opportunity when they didn’t add the thunder sound on the podcast name
That is grea and adorable
His tan is deeper im sure.
Very Important Video
I am very happy to see you back!
So, so happy you’re back.  Corrections will make my life complete.
Legit no one cares
Seth's commentary has consistently been pointing true north, which has been invaluable during a time when disinformation and lack of trust in media are at highs.
Nice
The Jackals have been having to correct actual people in person! It will be so nice to Jackal from our natural habitat again.
cool
Interesting and nice
nc😮
Yes
Did NBC not let you say the word strike on air 😂
Seth Meyers is the opposite of Bill Maher, Seth is a mensch who has real worker solidarity
Excellent
Why do you guys need writers anyways? You couldn't  improvised the last 5 months? The strike just shows how fake and untalented these so called comedians are!  Real comedians do need writers to be funny!
Revolution!
You guys need a general strike not a writers one
I am made whole again with your return
Ur a class act, Seth. Ur gratitude was beautifully expressed. I'm so glad u, ur writers, ur crew & whole team are back. It was a dark 5 months w/o ur light. 🤟🏽🥳
mis like writer
I missed this show so much! I didn't realize how much I loved it and looked forward to it until it was not on the air. Thank you WGA for getting a fair deal and getting writers back to work.
Yayyy we back
sooo.... after a  five month strike... I guess there will not be any breaks till next year... like  something so we can get the habit back
I am so happy you are back!
I can’t fucking wait for corrections ❤
YAY! I love that you intelligent, hilarious, excellent journalists and decent humans are in touch and support each other. I watch all of the late night fabulousness! Missing Samantha Bee and Trevor Noah, tho!! Not too mention, Jon Stewart! Xoxo
So glad that you’re back, Seth. I really missed you, but, I am happy that the writers got a good deal, because I am totally in support of unionized labor.
It’s okay actually, because it took the whole length of the strike for my auntie to realize that you’re not the governor of California. Now you’re her favorite
✊❤️✊❤️✊❤️✊❤️✊❤️✊❤️✊
who is this guy? seems familiar.
Seth is someone you didn’t know you need until he was gone for 5 months lol. Glad you’re back 🥲❤️
Hey Seth, so good to see you back. Pleased that the writers won. So glad to have someone to put the Trump nightmare into perspective. Surely, there are enough intelligent, sane Americans to kick him back to obscurity.
Welcome back! You all were very much missed 🫶😊
It's pronounced "fambigly".
*Finally... we'll have more Seth's meme to use now* _{really used tons of them along the years indeed}!_
Nobody like you, Seth Meyer! Great work as a team. You all are amazing. Missed you like crazy ❤️
I’m sure Seth’s 7 yr old also told him “And you’re NOT allowed to answer what I just said in your Giuliani voice either, it’s awful anyway!!”
Seth’s forehead is slowly consuming its surroundings and will one day take over the universe
See AI could never have done that a just win for writers and audiences!!! Welcome back!
No one cares
I bet those were the longest five months of anyone's life
Wish these fool never came back on air…
Hey Seth. Glad to have you back, and glad the writers got what they deserved, and glad that your staff and crew that were impacted by the strike are able to work with you and your great writers again to give all of us the show we love.
I did not miss any late show , just saying
Episode Five of SS5 is absolutely AMAZING. I almost had to pull my car over because I was crying laughing.
How can you even like this guy? He sucked in Saturday Night Live. Is that show still on? (Sorry guys, I just cleared out my you tube History and its bring up their stuff.) Enjoy
Singing to the tune of Welcome Back Kotter, Welcome back to the same old place . . .
I MISSED SETH SO MUCH ❤❤❤
Idonotwanttobeirritating. Butidonotknowwhatnetworkthatyouareon. Iwouldliketowatchlatenightsometimes. Thankyou iwillbewattchingthankyou. ❤
Missed the whole team! Congrats to all the writers on your historic win!!
I couldn’t bare to click on most news stories without the mediation of a comedian explaining it and contextualizing it for me. So glad you’re back with better contracts!
Vin Diesel actually says “Look out! He’s fast AND furious!”
Missed you so much! Congrats WGA
I didn't realize late night shows were off for 5 months.  I, for one, did not miss them.  I am happy that you are happy to be back in the studios.
The only show where you can actually name the writers as a casual show watcher and with time even say who wrote which joke, should be done more often in shows
Classy touch Seth!
Your forehead is too big.  It looks weird.
Correction: "Fast Five" is a movie, "Fast and Furious" is the franchise aka movies. Welcome back Seth.
Welcome back you talentless, low-rated creeps! You have been missed! ❤
뭐하는 사람이야
I’m so glad that you’re back! I’ve missed you!
As a member of IATSE (stage, not film), thank you for actively advocating before and after the strike for all unions involved in and supporting the WGA strike and continuing SAG/AFTRA strike. You've done more than most late night hosts.  My one critique would be just a touch more education. Talk about the gains that were won for wage increases, benefits,  AI restrictions. These are issues that will only continue to become more prevalent, and WGA has currently set the standard in the entertainment industry for how we can work with AI while not elimination jobs. The more it's a topic of discussion, the better we can all negotiate together.
Can't believe you referred to the Fast and Furious movies as Fast Five movies again, the jackals are gonna have a field day with that
Seth you were missed. Thank You.
Thank the Gods! Now I can finally get my poop schedule back on track
❤❤❤❤😂❤❤❤❤We love you!
Network made a compassionate choice? Maybe they couldvedonw it without 5 months of agony for all!😂
Welcome back, it was worth the wait for a fair deal.
Strike Force Five is fantastic... but Seth is 100% correct that episode 5 is the best. I laughed so hard I was nearly sick. (yes THAT sort of laugh)
Hey Seth. Great to have you and the rest of the team back. Greetings from Australia.
It wasn't a surprise, but it was still good to see Seth support the writers!  Even though we missed you, I feel like most Seth viewers understood why the strike was important.
Seth, I got so excited when I saw a new clip of your show was posted. I have literally been pining for 5 months. It helps me so much to watch your show, because during turmoil in the country, it feels like we're in this together. And of course you and your writers being hilarious doesn't hurt, either! Welcome back!
I will care when the DOJ gets the subpoenaed documents Giuliani is still hiding and they are evidence of Trump's intent to overthrow the government and sell classified documents to foreign governments.
Union Strong — Sisters and Brothers!  Congratulations!  Props to the folks (late night hosts for example) who supported those asking for fair compensation!  We are all stronger together!!
I love happy endings... So glad to see Seth, the writers, and the crew back.
Back to spewing propoganda
Literally nobody cared that these trash talk shows stopped. Nobody.
3:30... For two days now I have been struggling to come up with a light and frothy quip about being suddenly disconnected from a pretty ^$%^ significant coping tool for an awful lot of people who got through 2020 with the observations from Late Nite and the others to help make the crazy if not palatable or understandable, at least something to shake our heads at in wonder. lol  So I kind of got messed up with the disconnect and would stream old shows which felt like crossing the picket line and that messed me up more. It'll probably take a few news cycles! 🤣
I missed you guys, so glad they worked out a fair agreement! ❤
Glad we have you back
You can tell how serious you take it by the effort you put in your wardrobe! Only the finest! Who’s you tailor? JK bro. Love how you dress
Congrats on #12 on trending!
Typical workers don't get such extravagant TIME OFF.
SF5 was absolutely badass. But what do you call it when Stewart crashes it?
Welcome back!!Solidarity with the writers and actors!  Bravo to the writers for their successful negotiations! Now let's get a successful contract for the actors!!
Lol your poor wife must be delighted you’re back at wife ❤
Seth I missed you and the show so much don’t ever go again 🖤🖤🖤
Glad you’re back. Your closer look is always spot on!
God these last 5 months felt longer than the years of the pandemic lockdown.   At least we had you and the other late night comedians making sense of the insanity of the World during those years.  We didn't feel so alone!  Missed you! And aside for your STRIKE story, So much other crazy stuff happened too!.   I Really missed laughing at the end of the day feeling like it was Armageddon.  Our entire country up in Canada was literally burning from coast to coast to coast. Our wildfires smoke were Affecting many of the State's too. 😢  Anyway sorry I'm Just hearing about the PODCAST tonight as you talk about doing it.   Might have a listen.  Not really my thing.  Again congratulations on defeating the Invasion of the AI .....for now!  Stand strong we can't let any  AI,  Hal, Terminators, Replicants or any version of AI to  replace Humans or  ever get the chance to decide we are useless and a problem and to take over.  All those talking nearly sentient AI models they had at the science show in Vegas, stated how they would be able to end up enslaving the humans.   So Cha Ching for Winning this round! Bwahahah!🤣😂😉😅 ❤🎉🥂🍾💃🏻🇨🇦
Great to see everyone back.  But why does the lighting make the set look like jail cell bars?
good to have the shows back
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 LOVE YOU ALL!!! THANKS FOR GRABBING THE HELM AGAIN!! & sticking by your shipmates! 🩵🌊💦
The Jackals have missed you Seth! 🐾🐾
Im excited for more Corrections and The Wrong Take
Really missed you Seth. Sensitive towards the negotiators and extremely funny.
4:09 - I thought he was going to say "I am Groot"
I can't wait for corrections! 30 minutes??
Seth really needed the show to be back, so he can finally pay for a haircut right after
Gosh i really missed you guys
Great to see you and your production staff back!
so im like" writers need more", and writers are like "hosts need a lil more"  and the billionaires that own all their asses are like "FUCKYOU ITS MINE". easy to see which side of the strike to care about
I’ve channeled you every day as my girlfriend asks my why I’m watching the same closer looks like a loser eating lunch alone… “You’ll see meemaw…Seth is coming BACK!”  I also need to point out your sweater. It’s worn. Nice touch.
So glad to see everyone back! And glad it comes with a fair contract for the writers.
I wish the writers the very best in the whole world!!! ☮️☮️☮️❤️❤️❤️🌎🌎🌎
Seth, thank you so much for pointing at the camera and smiling straight at us, the at home audience. I missed you, I listened to your podcasts, bought from your sponsor Factor meals, and celebrate your return. It's lovely to be acknowledged by you. Your show is not a habit, it's a fresh treat every day.  Hope you keep up Family Trips. 🐾
Where wally
Great to have Seth and the crew back. Yes, even Lutz.
I was waiting for the Oscar's music to start playing 1/2 way through!  I've missed you all
No thunder clap for the Strike Force Five? It’s your favorite
Can you please help all of us understand what happened behind the scenes of this strike? 5 months, I'm having withdrawal! Welcome back Seth!
Hola soy de Ecuador cuidade de guallaquil no se si este señor es un robot 🤖 🤔  saludos soy nuevo
When he thanked NBC, nobody clapped or cheered. Nobody is on the same side as executives. They lost this one!
Missed this show so much. Went into withdrawl. Seth Fix
Not Seth plugging episode 5 of Strike Force Five 😂
Habit not broken. I just watched other stuff. Celebrity gossip is a lot like news about Giuliani.
While fully supporting the writers, this show is the one thing that I truly missed while they were on strike. So glad y'all found a resolution you're happy with and that the show is back!
I just got my 5-month chip from LNA (late night anonymous). Thanks
Congrats Seth on being funny again. :p
Seth is a living treasure. It's rare for someone so smart, funny, and talented to be so openly humble and grateful, admitting freely that his writers' room is a vital part of what makes his show work. Also, dedicating his time during the strike to raise money for his unpaid staff was just amazing. You're a good man, Seth, and I for one will remain a loyal viewer despite the hiatus.
Crap he's back. I was hoping this strike was going to go on forever.
Missed opportunity on the Strike Force 5 sound effect...
So glad the writers got a good deal!!  Happy you're back, but will definitely miss Strike Force Five! What a super group! 🤩
Missed the hell out of this guy's content.  I still go back and watch episodes from the pandemic when he moved rooms three or four times and was haunted by an image of a sea captain.  Welcome back!
All of this would make a great "Kind of Story We Need Right Now"... the way all the Late Night hosts stood in solidarity with the the Writers and the Guild and how y'all raised money for your peeps. 😻👍
Episode 5 was freakin hilarious 😂😂😂😂
So glad Seth is back! Now I can get my news!
Congratulations to all of the WGA!! Solidarity is the only way forward. No decent labor conditions were freely given, they were won in hard-fought battles like yours. Thank you for fighting for changes that make your industry a better place not only for yourselves, but for future writers as well <3
I've been jonesing for corrections
Yayayayayayayayayayayay YAY!!!!!!!!
The Five are like The Seven, minus The Deep and A-Train, while NBC is Voight, and without The Five, we are all doomed; destined for a seemingless never-ending depression, as seen in my bathroom mirror for the last five months...  Welcome back, Boys!
I just found out there was a strike force 5 podcast...
Wally’s the most literal writer of all.
Correction: they're not called the fast five movies. Fast five is a movie within the Fast and Furious franchise.
Hey Seth,  I've been a fan but honestly, I am so over watching talk shows. Hope to meet you someday...
8)
So glad you're all back! Wondered where the hell everyone went!!
I would love to be in your audience one day ❤❤❤ especially when bill hader is there 😍😍😍
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I missed team Seth so much! Without comedy, I get irritated with humanity and feel isolated.   You’re back bc my kid wondered why I’m laughing louder than usual. merci
The fact I can remember the name of his writers makes me feel that Seth does genuinely appreciate them
So glad you're back. All of your writers have been missed. Glad to get back into this daily habit.
There's been a hole in all our (viewers) lives. I'm glad things are settled.
"AI" Seth is pretty convincing.
I am so happy you are back. You were surely missed.
Ok, I'll bite. It's the "Fast & Furious" franchise, not the "'Fast Five' movies".
We had a routine watching you late night, and just like our pet dogs, whenever their routine gets thrown off, they go crazy. Well, we went crazy not seeing your show for a while😵‍💫 Welcome back!!!🙌👍
I waved,  when you said hello!
You are the best… missed you like crazy! Best news, best comedy, so glad you are back !  Proud of the support the writers got! Good job everyone!
I missed the writers so much. So glad they won. They did a service for everyone by fighting AI.
Wait, what?...a 7 year old ..!.!. Where has the time gone? My mornings have now returned for a day of levity amidst of all the du"/#pster sh$[_
You should have Adam Connover on!
Bring back corrections 🎉
I'm glad that the writer's strike is over, and the writers are getting paid again. Why, Scollins was getting so poor he couldn't afford a shirt!
never thank the people on the other side of a strike...thats, the enemy
Hey.  Hey.   I love that Seth is back. Weight off my shoulders. A nice resolution.   But... Is this Seth? I have a theory that during the strike the Hollywood execs made a weird clone of Will Poulter and Walton Goggins. For, y'know... reasons.   Just asking questions, guys.
Wait, you work at Olive Garden?
So good to have you back.....I feel as if a good friend has come back into my life.
Yea yea yea welcome back and what not...where's Wally!??!
I missed my late night shows SO much. I watch all you guys all the time. Your absence was felt in this crazy summer. I’m so happy late nights are back!!
I missed you Seth!!
It’s so good to have all of you back !! We did miss you all terribly .. I’m a big fan of all the late night hosts and I love that all of you are friends 💙
You have five month's worth of corrections to catch up on, man
So glad to have you back!!! Every time news came out, I found myself wondering what would be said on A Closer Look if it wasn't paused... but I am not nearly as clever or funny as you and your writers 🤣🤣 I'll leave the funny commentary to you guys now
WELCOME BACK SETH,WE REALLY MISSED YOU AT HOME IN PUERTO RICO.!!!
The franchise is The Fast and the Furious franchise.  Fast 5 is just one movie in the series.
"the Fast Five movies" nice callback
So glad and happy you're back!!!❤
Missed Yall!!!! Lets GO!!!!!!!
The genuine sense of community created by Seth & Co. over the yrs, esp. the COVID/-adjacent yrs, is truly awesome. We are awesome. Thank you, Seth & Co. Hooray Us!
Ah this is one habit I'm looking to keep, unlike crack and cigarettes, I wanna keep this habit.
Welcome back!  Thank you for supporting the strike.
Oi! No love for the jackals?
Was it a purposeful rebuke of you that the camera had you slightly out of focus for this segment?
This victory lap accepted by the hosts who make a staggering amount of the profit feels off. Shouldn’t they let the writers on stage to take a bow or something.
So happy you are back! Cannot say how much I missed you! Tell the writers and crew I send my best to them!!  ❤
So, you've all been off for months because the people who write these shows weren't getting what they deserve? It had to come to that? And you felt necessary to sing the management praises for finally paying them better? How can they deserve any credit? Do you think they were paying the writers too little by chance or something? That they didn't know? Or heard them asking for a raise?   I hope there will be many jokes about this making it into the show. If they don't, better not be you that cut them.
It's FAST AND FURIOUS. FAST FIVE is the title of part 5, not the series as a whole.  Ahh, it's good to be back.
correction: You forgot to mention us, the jackals.. sniff
Correction: there's only one Fast Five movie; the franchise is the Fast & Furious movies and an animated spin-off about Vin Diesel's character's cousin, Tony.   I've missed this.
So happy to have y'all back! Glad the Writer's Guild got what they deserve.
Been seriously missing your show!
I am so excited for corrections this week!
SO GLAD YOU'RE ALL BACK!!!🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Ahhhh.  I missed you too.  I missed you so much I watched old episodes and kept screaming “OLD NEWS!  THAT’S OLD NEWS, SETH!”  Anyway, glad you are back.
MY GAWD I MISSED THIS HUNK 😢thank you writers... thank you staff... I'm back addicted to SETH 🎉
Missed you inconsolably - so glad you and crew have returned victorious!!! Let the healing begin and closer looks commence!
Welcome back Seth!  Missed you here in Oz ❤❤❤
Yes!!!! I missed you.. so glad you're back. Congrats to the writers!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉  Seth you have been missed. Can’t wait to get a closer look at these pass few month.
Seth you’ve been back for a few hours, and you’ve already repeated a mistake that had to be addressed in corrections previously. You said “the fast 5 movies.” Fast 5 is one of the movies; the movies are the Fast and the Furious movies.
I realize now how much I love the writers and NEVER UNDERPAY THEM AGAIN.
Oh I've missed this show!!!
So thrilled that Seth, Wally, Amber and all of the Late Night writers are back. Slogging through this absurd dystopian hellscape for the past five months without your sharp, humorous  commentary has not been fun, but it’s great to have everyone back, and I congratulate the WGA for getting a fair contract and compensation.
*raise your writers' salaries*
Seth: "I love having this as a workplace." Me: "I love helping correct Seth's mistakes." Also Me: "I love being a professional jackal."
This show is one of my comfort blankets ❤ so happy to hear the writers are being properly compensated for their creative work, though, I’m excited for the next Surprise Inspection, when we learn who doesn’t deserve the new contracts 👀 🙃
Happy to have you back. You have been sorely missed.
CORRECTION (although likely a flub from the joy of coming back): The film series is titled "Fast and Furious", "Fast Five" is only the fifth installment. So there can't be "Fast Five movies".
So glad you’re back! 1:55
wow HD tv is unforgiving to seth's wrinkly wrinkles.....its like alyssa edwards backrolls 😂😂😂
Hello!!! So grateful (not as grateful as the strikers, granted -- and kudos to them!!!) you're back.
To be honest. a break from you was nice too.  Now get back to work! and make it funny.  God knows the execs are gonna make US pay for this somehow.
Love you guys. Seth, the writers, the entire crew that makes this show possible! You bring joy and comfort to so many people. Never forget that. Your work matters. You matter. You deserve the best!
Oh yes, WGA negotiators. The thousands of Below the Line production workers and their families who have been financially devastated by a strike in which they had no representation, definitely thank you. And hey! Writers are already back to work. Wow. I.A. Guilds and production crew don’t even get their 12 hour six day, not adjusted for inflation, gig to gig jobs back. But we’re so happy for the writers.
I love you and your show! So glad you're back and so glad your writers have the contract they deserve
My serotonin providers ❤😂
❤
🤩✨🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰✨WELCOME BACK!
Dude, seriously, you're the only one I am really, really glad to see again.  The other dudes are all funny, but you're the only one who makes me laugh hilariously on a regular basis.
BRING BACK CORRECTIONS
AT LAST !!!!!!
We missed you  all!
The NOTICABLE lack of "agreement applause" following him thanking the studio 😂
why do you always call them the "Fast Five" movies lmaoo
Heck yeah!
Fan of the show like everyone else here. Excited to see you back.  @seth since you know “negotiators “, could you please ask them to pass on some wisdom for UAW deal to close sooner?😢
on a serious note, in my opinion news these days is so depressing it is easier to get it from shows like this, served with humor. I'd rather hear it here first, so I can filter out the topics I want to look at a little deeper. What's more, it never hits as hard when you already laughed about it before.
Welcome back, Seth. I've missed you!
Like an acceptance speech lol love it
Yes, I'm for the WRITERS and ACTORS, but I'm also for the THEATER WORKERS! Strikers, also mention that theater workers who sell the tickets, get the lowest wages and benefits allowed by law  Musicians join them! Three Labels,  the Big Three Labels control music, and no hits, no new stars, loss of sales. 1% of musicians make 90% of streaming money.  Look at connections to film. Warner,  Universal,  Sony.  Have you ever read a story on low wages that mentioned Theater Workers - and by doing so anger Hollywood that brags about how many millions they made this weekend? Me neither.  they should. They are forced to work part-time so they're paid the lowest wages and benefits allowed by law. Hollywood looks glamorous but they are just as bad as Walmart or fast food, and the media is scared to talk about it.
Welcome back Seth, and congratulations to you and to all the writers on your hard-fought victory against the greedy studios. We missed you! #UnionStrong #WGAEastStrong #WGAWestStrong #Solidarity
I hope with all my heart, that this means a return of Corrections too!!
So glad to have you and your amazing staff back on air.🥳🥰
i’m too old to get half your jokes I was at a high school beer bash in October 1974 when they aired the first Saturday night live.  However, I did watch this whole piece and I thank you
Eagerly waiting for more of "what does Karen know?"
During those 5 months I still watched your evening shows every night. So glad and excited everyone is back.
#Correction there's a link to this video in the description of this video. Pointless for it to be there. Ditto the opening news/monologue "Trump Appears in Court..." I suspect the two links were intended to each be in the other video.
Here is a man who literally during pandemic lockdown did the show from his attic or his parents house spare bedroom and what gets him to shut it down is when his writers strike for better working benefits. That is a man that knows both the value of his viewers and his coworkers #BringBackSeaCaptain #SethMyersSeaCaptain
Welcome Back ❤️ Missed you ❤️
I care what Rudy Juliani does today AND tomorrow ♥️♥️♥️
Welcome back Dude.... we miss you and the show... UK.. Davey P.
Notice no mention of the has-been Bill Maher ........lol
So excited to be back and anticipating the next "Surprise Inspection"! ❤❤❤
Did he say " The Fast Five movies" on purpose?
Thanks for being my favorite habit!!!! I didn't want to quit, the doctor "suggested it," so I'll probably be fine. 😉
Episode 5 is the best one.  I didn't want it to end.
First Covid then the strike really makes wonder what is going to happen next.
Very fair...? Or just fair? I think, just fair.
Correction!!!  I got nothing. I just wanted to get back in the game. Something will come up, surely.
Welcome back, Seth and team! Truly, thank you for the best written show in late night!
Howdy Seth, it's wonderful that the demands of the WGA have been met, workers collectively organizing to have their needs met is both deeply inspiring and a necessary element of an egalitarian society. That being said, however, I would like to correct you, as you called the "Fast & Furious" franchise the "Fast Five franchise".
Missed you guys so much!
I started watching the show when the pandemic started and I was running out of things to watch so i thought "fine, i'll give it a go".  /jk  - Seriously, though - so happy you guys are back.
This guy is like if your boss tried to make you laugh. Asshole supervisor vibes
I MISS YOU’LL SO MUCH!! ❤❤ WELCOME BACK! ❤️❤️❤️
Welcome back, Seth!
There's a Podcast support group for Late Night Hosts? ahahaha!😅
Episode 5 is the best episode hands down
Very glad to have you back.
every time seth has to take a break he comes back even more casual. i bet we see him in just a t-shirt and jeans soon.
I'm such a happy jackal!
Seth is a good dude.
🙄
Missed this show SO MUCH, but am so impressed that the strike didn't budge before a fair agreement was reached.  Solidarity!
I needed that podcast for the last 5 months and NOW I learn that it exists.
👏👏
Really curious what positive things NBC did for the writers, to which he referred. Anyone know?
words are not enough.  thanks for this.  my sanity requires sincere intelligent mockery of tyranny in all its current forms
Greetings from the international audience.
Yay! So nice to have the show back, especially since it came after a fair deal for the writers. A full hour of A Closer Look was the perfect way to celebrate writers and get us back to it.
I can only watch these on YouTube, can’t see this show in Australia. I learn a lot from these late night shows, lots of American news etc. Glad it’s back.
Didn't realize how much I missed you until I laughed OUT LOUD for the first time in a long time! Gratitude and respect. 💙
Waving (I literally waved at the TV 😂)  hello from WA State!  So happy my therapists are back in action! ✌️
Missed You very much, too, over here in Cologne. Very grateful to everyone who made it possible to bring You back on air ❤
DOES THIS MEAN CORRECTIONS IS BACK?!?!?!
Hi, Seth, welcome back! You were greatly missed in Paris, France too! When you and your super fellow late night show hosts disappeared, I first thought there was something wrong with my computer ... :o)  Good on all of you to have shown solidarity with the writers! And congrat's for you collective success.  Keep making us laugh (intelligently)! Thank you.
So glad you’re back and happy the guild was able to negotiate a fair deal!
lost the thunder ... Yikes!!!
SO happy you're back! Glad for the all the writers!🎉🎉🎉
SETH MEYERS I LOVE YOU AND I MISSED YOU!! Also you are the funniest on strike force five love ya pal
did he always say "uhhhhh" so much?
I missed you all so much!😭 I definitely did not lose the habit, I just rewatched old episodes on YouTube. I definitely had forgetten some of the f*cking absolute bonkers stuff from the Trump administration. I think I blocked it for my own sanity.🥺 Anyhoo...so glad you're all back! Congrats on the successful strike! And for the shining example of collective action having a positive impact on workers' rights and compensation!✊
There is no breaking the habit. We have been waiting anxiously but patiently.
So Seth isn't in the actor's union - or somehow talk show hosts count as writers and not actors?  Got used to not watching late night, think I'mma keep going with that.
Time to take a vacation, Seth?
Seth you will be the easiest habit to pick back up ❤ so happy for the writers, and happy to have you back!
I missed you soooo Much!!! You saved me through Covid. But the last 5 months has been hard mentally, without your humor for escape. Love you and the mug.
So now all the woke mainstream media late night talk show hosts can go back to dividing the country with their polarizing political opinions. They are no longer funny to anyone other than their democratic audience. Just my opinion
Ole Texas guy….I need this show before I start my day so I don’t feel alone.  Vote blue even if it’s hopeless
Welcome back and congrats to the writers!
I’ve been forced to watch the actual American news for the past five months and it has not been nearly as informative, let alone entertaining let me tell ya. Worth it to get the writers the deal they wanted, so glad to have you all back.
I loved the all 'Closer Look' episode! Who needs guests? You should only have guests with important viewpoints that you really want to have on. The actors on just to advertise some movie are boring.
Epic Return!
I'm gonna miss Strike Force 5 (sometimes 6) ):
Didn't know about that podcast! Will listen to it tonight!
O the humanity
Immensely dissapointed that Strike Force Five didn't get a lightning strike. 🌩
Correction: You thanked NBC / Universal for how they treated your staff during the strike, but made no mention of Ryan Reynolds' support via Strike Force Five?  Or with five movie stars all on the same podcast, did you forget about him altogether?
I’ve missed you the most Seth!!!
Comment jackal for life!
Great to have you back, you and your amazing writers........ were truly missed! Congrats!🎉
I missed you, Jimmy.
Unpopular Opinion Correction: You missed a golden opportunity to play the thunder sound effect when you said Strike Force Five (just once, of course) as a nod to all the jackals who have been shouting corrections at Spotify for the last month.
Wait, late night returned? Who knew?
@corrections staff. Make sure Seth makes a bunch of mistakes this week. See you on Friday.
🇨🇦👌👌👌👌
Just stopping by to remind all of you, that none of you celebs or writers, are essential workers. TY that is all.
Congratulations to the writers on their historic victories
Ya know what they say about work places that say “we’re family here”.
3:27 Seth, it's more than a habit for us viewers who've waited this long - it's a genuine addiction! 😂
I am so f***in’ pumped for the return of Corrections, y’all have no idea.
So glad to have you and all the late night hosts back!  I’ve missed you guys! You all make me laugh and in the crazy times we are living through we all need a good laugh. Thanks to the writers, glad you got the deal you wanted. Welcome back Seth and staff.
THIS is the show I've missed the most the last five months
I have missed you so much! Wecome back!
SO glad you're back and so happy for your writers! ❤
☕🧐👍 Living in Britain i didn't even notice it was gone, it just stopped appearing in my YouTube feed. It honestly didn't occur to me that it was much more than Seth just doing standup! 😂 And obviously the writers thing didn't affect us, different unions.
I love Vin Diesel❤
Shortest strike I’ve ever seen and they got what they wanted. Yet people have to literally riot for basic human rights
MOST rich people stay rich by spending like the poor and investing without stopping then most poor people stay poor by spending like the rich yet not investing like the rich but impressing them
Break the habit??? Dude I was seriously starting to think about starting my out garage talkshow.....thank goodness the strike is settled
I'm SO happy to see you again, Seth! ❤
CORRECTION: They are called the Fast and Furious movies, Fast 5 movies doesn't make sense because that was just one film. And there are more than 5 movies in the series, so you don't even have that argument... glad to have you and your silly mistakes back though.
Great to have this show back, it must have sucked to have so many crazy things happening the past couple months, but not being able to do the usual bits about them.  There were so many golden "tears in his eyes" moments.
sucks that Jimmy Fallon was involved with Strike Force Five. hes the worst.
So glad to have you back and that the writers are getting what they deserve. Also CORRECTION! They are not the “Fast 5” movies, but rather the “Fast and the Furious” movies. I think you’ve actually made that mistake before. Can’t wait for Corrections!
Episode 5 is definitely the best one!  You need to do a part 2, invite Conan and his wife, and please let Fallon be in charge of the questions again.  That was wonderfully chaotic!! 😆  Glad you’re back!
Oh sure, you love the crew...  Then where were those reverse-angle shots of the floor and control room crew, huh?  WHERE WERE THEY, MEYERS??  NOT EVEN WALLY???
the writers stike over is nearly?
I’m so incredibly glad you are back! I start my mornings with your videos and I’ve only had the regular news for the last five months and I’ve been so depressed by that!
Yeah I am  not breaking the habit
I was this close to quitting YT. All I had left for the news was BTC and it was getting old so fast. All I had left for laughs was Smosh, and it’s … changed since it was bought back.   I feel like a weight has been lifted. My routine can go back. ❤   Gosh, I hope he does another postcard event for his international viewers. I promise to use a typed address and romaji this time. 💔
Now we just have to pray that the SAG strike ends soon.
Hazzah. Let loose the Jackals
The Jackals are back too baby, we are back too.
Huh, didn’t notice you were gone
Hearing “Strike Force Five” without the thunderclap just isn’t the same
After 5 months off the air, Scollins doesn't look that bad, does he? 😂
Wow Welcome Back Seth .. 🥳👍
I'm grateful for seeing your face again seth:)
So how many sea captain bits did Seth do on his own?
Bring back the Sea Captain!
Can’t wait for “Corrections” on Friday
well now we know what episode is seth's favorite... Episode 5... The Meyers Strikes Back
I have a correction: The franchise of movies aren’t called the “Fast 5” movies. Only one of them is called “Fast 5”.
Seth is absolutely right when he said that this is show is a habit for some people. I know during the strike, I would go back and rewatch Monologues, A Closer Looks, and brush up on my Corrections lore, but all the while I was kinda nervous thinking that the writers wouldn't get a fair deal and we'd never get another Animal Flub (come at me 😂). We're all so grateful that you're all back and that the writers have a fair deal! ❤🎉🎉
"I would like to thank....some people" I thought Seth was going into his Obama imitation with the pause there.
*blows dust off my jackal ass* I've never heard of the "Fast Five" movies, Seth !
Man it’s awesome you guys are back!
CORRECTION:  they're not the "fast five" movies, they're the "fast and furious" movies.  Also, they suck.
Correction - "Fast Five" movies? Is this a test It's the "Fast & Furious" movies although the fifth movie in the franchise WAS CALLED Fast Five 😂 SO glad this show is back!!!! Cheers to the writers and staff, thanks Seth for taking the time to thank everyone also!!!
Welcome back Seth! Thanks for sticking with your writers and supporting their struggle.
The Jackals Return
So glad you are back. Now where is my corrections? ;-)
your 7 year old gives me hope for the future!
❤❤❤❤❤ Welcome back! You and your team were missed!
Thanking now the WGA negotiating committee after being held hostage for so long is clearly a sign of "Stockholm syndrome" 😂
welcome back! congratulations to the wga; i’m so glad they were able to get a fair deal 👏❤️
The writers strike should have mandated more female late night hosts.. just saying.. but love Seth!!! Love love love Seth
Finally!  That was a very long drought 😪 😩  So great to have you guys back! Thanks for hanging in there ❤
The "Fast Five" movies... can't wait for Corrections already
CANNOT WAIT FOR CORRECTIONS
Welcome backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk! Yay!🎉🎊❤️ missed y’all so much!
It's so awesome the writer's did so well with the union contract. It's amazing beyond words how you supported them throughout the strike.  The wait was worth it! And it's the best that you're all back!
Glad to have you back!
CORRECTION: There was no thunderclap after saying “Strike Force Five”. Everyone knows there should be a thunderclap. It’s science.  WELCOME BACK!!!
So happy you and your team are back!
I cannot express my relief at having you all back. I've been surviving this dystopian nightmare without your delightful show, and I'm beyond grateful to have your support back 🙏
We are all so happy you are back with us, Seth.  You are my favourite late show host and thee was a huge daily gap in my day without you.  I am a Canadian and “sort of” kept up with American politics through you.  You die hard fans would never get out of the habit of watching you … ever.  It says so much about you that you took the time to address us with your appreciation of those with whom you work.  You are just the nicest person.  Thanks for all you do.  I am also glad that everyone stuck to their guns and were willing to do what needed to be done for a mutually beneficial outcome for all concerned.  Congratulations!
Missed your show so much - I watch you via YouTube (I live overseas) and am happy to have you back in my morning routine!
So glad to have you guys back. You don’t understand how much we needed you 😢
You are such a great human being. Keep being.
😊😊😊
Im so upset i havent watched this show as much as I anticipated when it began!  Full series binge incoming! LOVE YOU SETHLY!
Welcome back Seth, my first coffee of the morning hasn't been the same without you.  It is a long time since I laughed so that I spat coffee on the monitor!
Trust us we are just as glad you are back!  We couldn't wait till time to watch each of you!
I missed you so much! So happy you're all back!
I wish Larry Wilmore and Samantha Bee had been in that roll call of late night hosts.
So happy you are back! Love how his hair is kinda morphing him in to Odo from deep space 9
Seth's right about Strike Force Five episode 5. I was laughing my ass off listening to it!
It was a rough crazy 5 months not having late night and it wasn't like during the pandemic where we at least had the sea captain.
So glad to have you back Seth.  Your show is amazing and you and your writers deserve all the accolades you receive.   A lot has happened in Trump land so please go nuts.   He deserves all the jail time coming to him. LOL
Watched “A Closer Look” last night and was amazed!😂😮😅❤🎉
If I ever break  the Meyers-Oliver-Colbert habit, slap me silly, and call me a Republican!
"break the habit" HA! You don't know how addicted I can be!
Can someone negotiate for all the translators all over the world. We translate content for international audiences but have poor compensation and no rights 😢
Glad to see all the writers? Even Scollins?   Really, though?
The expression is "for granite!", educate yourself!
Just glad y'all are back, and that the writers can actually make a living at it.
Welcome back!!! You were missed.
Seth, you should have have the thunder sound effect going when you said the named of the pod cast!
Good to see Seth and his talented writers back in action and with the strike going in the writers favor. Let's keep America Trump free and union strong!
Can’t break my habit!
Welcome back! So glad!
Welcome back Seth and the Late Night family, we've missed you all! Much love from a Dutch Jackal.
Hopefully Scollins wore his formal tank-top on the first day back.
i missed you Seth! almost as much as I miss the Sea Captain, but that is besides the point. I normally keep away from commenting on the videos of people that cover politics but I am just elated to see you again!
As an independent author, i can say "hallelujah" WOOOOOOOO
I have a reason to live again - Seth's back!
Seth why didn't you mention how much you missed doing corrections?!?
I don’t have cable by choice, and I greatly appreciate these videos! Your crew is amazing, and so are the writers! Glad they got it all figured out, and back to Closer Looks 🙌🏽
Welcome back. We missed you and your team
YEAH BABY! YOU’RE BACK!!!! Damn it’s been a too long
YEAH, YOURE BACK WE MISSSED YOU!
I now appreciate the segments where Seth highlights his writers, even when in jest, that much more.
🙏🙏🙏🙏
I love your seven-year-old's assessment of Rudy Giuliani's importance to the universe at large. It reminded me of my five-year-old's perspective on reading when I threatened Jewish grandmother fashion, "If you don't learn how to read, you are going to work at McDonald's for the rest of your life!" His face brightened and he answered, "Free chicken McNuggets for me"
Seth, they're the Fast & Furious movies, not Fast 5 movies.  Fast 5 is the fifth entry in the Fast & Furious saga.
Hey Seth. Glad to see you back. Enjoyed your live show in Atlanta. Stick to comedy!
Welcome back! Boy did I miss you guys! ❤❤
Late night has lost all its talent.  The writing sucks and the hosts are terrible, which is why rating are their lowest in history
I have really missed this show and  your A Coser Look. So very glad to have it back !
YAHOOO😊
The strike made me watch less tv and that’s a good thing
Classy.
The fast five movies?
So glad to have this back 😭 even though this show is always a good laugh, the news curation is what you really come back for
That could have used a little punch-up. Who would Meyers turn to fer something like that.
YAY! Welcome back, Seth & crew & all the folks who have been away these last months! We missed you and need you more than ever Right Now!!💕
We’ve missed your writers, too… Where’s Jenny?
A reason to watch ads on YouTube, late night talk shows.
Morning poops aren’t the same without ya! Welcome back
Great to have you back!
Very happy for the wga and everything but I'm also gonna miss strike force 5 ALOT 😭😭😭
Missed you!!!
I’m so so glad you’re back!
I watch the monologue every morning, as I get ready for work. You have been missed.❤
We missed all of you so much. Watched reruns on YouTube, but it wasn't the same.❤
best day ever to have Seth back ❤❤❤❤
So glad that the show is back! I had the chance to say hi and shake his hand after your standup act in Amsterdam this summer, Seth was amazingly friendly and very human. Sometimes it is good to meet your heroes.
I'm wondering how awkward the writers' room is now on these shows. Meyers, Colbert, Oliver all came up through the ranks as writers, but somehow had ZERO influence on the conditions of the shows their names adorn...
We've missed you and the high quality staff that work with you to bring the show to it's audience.
Gotta laugh they’ve claimed a big win rejecting the conditions a few weeks ago that they caved on more 😂 setting minimum numbers is a joke… not a lot of touch with reality…
❤
Aaw! You're wecome, Seth! But you don't need to thank me. :D
What is this  “talk show” you speak of?
Welcome back!
Keep the podcast going!!!
Welcome back! We missed you all!
I'm so excited the show is back and that a good deal was struck for the writers. They deserve better treatment. ❤
We don't care.  Now shut up and make with teh funny!
Welcome back. My happy day today. Missed you so much 💃💃💃💃🤗
Correction: You said "Fast Five movies" but there aren't multiple Fast Five movies. Instead, "Fast Five" is one of the movies in the Fast & Furious movie franchise. Just know that correcting you is just this jackal's way of showing gratitude for your return. It's good to have you back and be shamelessly pedantic again.
Welcome back. 💖
I was baffled when he said Strike Force Five without a thounder sound effect. I need continuity!!!!
I am just glad everything worked out for everyone
Welcome back Seth, buddy (and all those whose backs you stand upon). Love you all. Hope we can see this kind of change everywhere.
They f..ed up hus make up, or he has a strange sun tan;) a bit trumpesk
Seth, I think you meant to say the Fast and Furious movies. Fast 5 was the 5th in that series. There was only one Fast 5 movie. Great to have you back.
So are the Luddites telling themselves now that they "managed to keep AI out of writing"? #lol The only writers who will remain are the ones who know how to use AI.
I have always appreciated that Seth and Stephen Colbert regularly made a point to bring their writers to the spotlight and credit them.
Glad for the strike and people's right to be both paid fairly and protected from corporate AI bs But What a 5 months to be without the reflection & information of the late night shows! Welcome back.
Disappointed in not hearing the sound effect after Strike Force Five haha.
Union negotiations are difficult, and kudos to everyone who toughed it out. I really hope that you got the pay, the conditions that you wanted and definitely deserve. If it took a five month hiatus of comedy withdrawal for people to realise that the actual livelihoods of humans are on the line… AND you’ve narrowly avoided a Federal Government shutdown. Unions are the best option. Power in numbers. Godspeed to you all in the USA.
I was hoping he never was coming back. The actors are still on strike, so why did the writers go back?
Welcome back. And we are so happy too!
Corrections? Wait a minute.  I know Seth is in the WGA, But he's on screen talent, so he's also a member of SAG..... SAG is still on strike. Shouldn't Seth still be on a picket line for SAG?  Honest question. Did he get a waiver or something?
I missed these segments and my daily news ❤️
CORRECTIONS: After saying "Strike Force 5." There should have been a clap of thunder.  This Jackal missed yas!
Seth, We're A Family is what retail bosses say to their minimum wage workers when they start agitation for raises and better conditions.   When I worked GameStop, closing shift was the worst because the in house TV starts playing propaganda from the leadership with repeated We're A Family rhetoric and Protect The Family, Family First, over and over and over again while a poster hangs in the bathroom about how we shouldn't talk about our wages with our co workers.   That's loaded language, and broadcasts a disrespect for workers who are STILL fighting for a fair shake in the food service and hospitality industries.
Welcome the flip back
So happy you’re back!
No Wally Segway… 😢
I missed getting my "news" with the absurdities pointed out.  However, the writers deserved to be better compensated. Congratulations!
Welcome back Seth the great. we really missed you Sir !!
We missed y'all so much. Welcome back.
Missed you, welcome back, quick correction: they're not the Fast Five movies, Fast Five was just one of the movies.
In UK, I watch CloserLook with my coffee in the mornings. Not been same without ya 🤙🏼x
So glad to have you back! This is a habit that is easy to fall back into!
I missed you so much brother, Seth is back baby!!!!!!!!
So glad u r back. Missing ur commentary these past months put me in a big funk. I stopped shaving my legs and to my horror, I found out all my legs hairs have turned white. I hope, i hope, I hope, they might go back to their original dirty dishwater brown once again so that I can once again turn off any romantic encounter for just being « that nasty chick with skanky brown hair » instead of  « that nasty chick who reminds me of my grandma »…u keep me young…keep up the good work!
Where was the Strike Force 5 sound effect?? 😂
Finally! Now instead of watching vids of stupid Republicans saying stupid stuff. I get to watch vids of Seth make fun of stupid Republicans, saying stupid stuff.
America is BACK!!! We have missed you so bad. Congratulations to the writers - Solidarity 💙
All I can mention, is that not only have The Jackals, but the writers for this show have severely missed out on the last 5 months. But not just only the SNL skits waiting to happen of the recent Republican debates that we just endured, but also the myriad of follies and fumbles that have gone completely unscathed and untouched by unrelenting hands. Until Now. Open season has begun.
❤
Thank you and ppochie(sp?) for family trips!
4:00 “the Fast Five movies” lmao
Bootlickers are back!
I really feel like there should have been a thunder strike after you said the name of the podcast. I know how Seth feels about it but still
So happy you guys are back!!
So is the vacation podcast with poshe over?
Honestly? The strike had gone on for so long that I found other things that I enjoy instead.
Union Strong.
The sincerity of all the late night hosts is great. Welcome back 💯💯
So interesting how I can't even stomach to look at you now after seeing how off the rails woke democrat ideology has gone. I guess I had my metaphorical red pill and I am so repulsed by the gender ideology and anti white racism, and glamourizing obesity. Don't want to look at any of you people. Jon Oliver lying about the Dylan Mulvaney bud light boycott right before the strike. Unsubscribing, y'all lost the plot if there ever was one.
I hope you take over the Tonight Show!!!
But did your son mention that Rudy married his cousin?
👏👏👏👏👏🥳
Please get Adam Conover as a guest ASAP.  I've really enjoyed his input through the process and I haven't had nearly enough of it.
It’s been a while!
okay, episode 5 it is then. What is the second best? My train ride is a little longer than a podcast.
Although the strike was DEFINITELY needed and I am so happy the writers got a better deal, MY GOODNESS WELCOME BACK!
We're glad that you're back. We've needed your voice. And theirs. Welcome back, Seth!
Welcome back Seth.. Last week at a 7-11 i exclaimed out loud "DAMN I MISS LATE NIGHT TV!!!"  🫶
Soooooooo glad you are back !!!!!!!!!!!!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Missed the mark, displaying the staff.
Oh hell-O beautiful!!
"...you, audience at home..."    Yay! [cheers, applause]
Welcome back. Well done.
WGA and SAG-AFTRA are the heroes here, but can I just say that Seth’s absolute non-sequitur vin diesel quote is so exactly my kind of humor that I can’t imagine anyone other than my namesake Ian writing it.
This and John Oliver are literally the only things I missed 🤣
No shout out to the Jackals? Great to have all my favs back, though the structure of pay seems to be rooted in a bad system of sharing the profit of success.
It's great to see all these creative people back to work. It's a shame it had to take so long and cause so much hardship. In business and politics we should all resolve to work differences out before extremes take over. I would love to live and work in a world where strikes were never necessary and shutdowns unthinkable.
WGA needs to unite with other unions against the real threat.  Social media companies.  They've been using others IP with impunity for years.
My strike force five favorite!
Seth, you’re hilarious, but come on, man, SHAVE!  It’s bad enough you don’t wear a suit, and now, after all this time, you couldn’t even bother to shave for your come back?
Who else went straight to the comments while watching the video just to like all the wholesome jackal messages appreciating Seth, the writers, the power of unions/collective action, and all the people who make this show happen. This show makes my day a little brighter and so do the fans of this show.
F’yeah we miss you all. 🎉❤😊
So happy you’re back! Congratulations, writers 💛
So happy you guys are back!!! Heck I even missed Scoogens (I have no clue how to spell his name but I know he wears a tank top). They are the. best and they only make your show better!!! Thanks for coming back and your past shows / corrections kept my spirits up.
Was being nice to the writers and staff part of the union agreement, Seth???
Great sweaters are back!
Nice to have you back.
https://youtu.be/MkK-DYayS-w?si=Pe0NmrnOFiNWTHdu&t=101
As always Seth is a class act!
That was a long and difficult time.
Like seth said I also want to say thank you to all the team that make this and other shows possible. Without all of you on staff these shows wouldn't be able to share with us all your comedy and news and so on. Sending the best of wishes for you all who make our days just a little brighter and lighter from a full load aimed at us at times with such dirty malignant ideals and actions and spoken words from the mouths of idiots pretending to know whats best for all of us. This is to long. Again nice to have you all back.
Seth you are an addiction that takes longer than 5 months to get over! I am so happy you are back!
Seth has been gone so long, he forgot about the Jackals.  Man, he even had a segment dedicated to them....
I hope that Corrections this week is completely unhinged
***Well Said! [But of course You're a WRITER too, So, We would Expect That.]
Only one more week until the next Corrections!
Algorithm
Welcome back, the win for writers was hard fought and well earned!
♥
The jackals missed you!!!!
Waiting for the first roll call. 😂
This guy is funny! Who is he now?
Habit??!!! I need you like I need air to breathe!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤😅😅😅🎉
God I’ve waited for this show to come back. So glad the writers got the deal they wanted ❤
Welcome back Late Night crew. I sure missed you!  Salutations from a jackal in Brussels (Belgium)
Myself , the Jackals, and everyone else is glad to have you back. So let us sit back every week night and get back into our norm. Well all missed you guys and welcome back. So bring on the laughs.
I'm international, I missed you. the only way I watch your show is from Youtube.
I think you should address whatever doofus uploads the clips out of order.  If you are not going to give us the whole episode, at least give us the chunks in an order that makes sense and pays off the work *of the writers*
🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤😊😊😊😊
Correction: Fast five is just one movie, the fifth one in the fast and furious series to be specific
Classy touch Seth! Happy to have you and all the late night guys back. I can LMAO everyday again. Except Saturday and Sunday. 😂
Solidarity
Hooray !!  So glad you're back and you got a deal you are all happy with ❤
"I want to thank you *points at camera* the audience at home :D" (⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠)⁠❤ lol
"sooooooo..." cruel that we were deprived of Seth & his gang for sooooooo long! 😌😌😌
I'm so glad everything's being resolved and this show is back. Coming to youtube weekly and not seeing a new episode crushed me when the strike first occurred. I'm so happy. Welcome back!!
I’ve been a fan of the show for years and in a way, I feel like we’re all growing old(er) together. The show was there during personal hardships, it was there during the pandemic, the protests, the won elections and more importantly, during the lost ones. More than a habit, it became a constant and a baseline and it feels damn good to have it back on air. Welcome back, Seth and Writers! You’ve all been greatly missed!
Yes, thank you to all the writers. Surprise inspection when?
You have no idea how much we missed you ..down under ✌🏿✊🏽🫡😎
There is power in a union💪❤
Got my fingers severely 🤞🤞🤞 for Friday. 🐾 😉🐾
Correction: "To quote Dominic "Dom" Toretto..."
Giving lots of thanks to everyone, but not actually addressing the strike, or whether bringing the show back can be considered crossing the picket since SAG are still striking...
Hey Seth, we’ve missed you these 5 months. Your joyful videos would brighten my day every time
Go Unions!!! 🎉🎉🎉
