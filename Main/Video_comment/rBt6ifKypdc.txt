The second one made me realize you never get rid of school every time you got called to the principals office you thought you were in trouble
ELITE
My toxic trait 😂😂😂
Well these were dark 😂
It’s five AM and my Harry Potter energy has just been summoned
Best ever, so true!!!
The fact about cleaning is my personality 🤣
THE CLEANING TOXIC TRAIT! One of many not-so-great traits my ex-husband had.
The equivalent to the second one for me is when the phone rings in the classroom and it's for me
“My favorite part about having a job is assuming you’re fired every time your boss calls you into there office”  Yeah sounds like having a mom to me
His laugh tho 😂
Seriously when someone compliments me is the most awkward thing ever. 🤣
That’s why I love my boss. She’s made it very clear that she will never fire you in her office so you never worry about going in. If there is something bad that needs to be discussed she will discreetly pull you aside and if it’s something positive or she has a question the office is where we go.
Bro how do you laugh at every thing
I love his laugh
The job thing is so true lol
When someone tells u a compliment    *that dog* :  *took ate and left no crumbs to a whole new level* 💀💀😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Your video so good I like the video the first comment but the Bad part is I don’t regret it throughout the video
Every mom have that toxic trait...omg xd
Idc what people say about his laugh, it’s so contagious😭
My toxic trait is I'm either really nice or really horrible and you will never know which one you are talking with.  Until its to late
The first one 😂
Ben..your so adorable!!! And your laugh is just so damn delicious!!
The Harry Potter one; Same.
The cleaning one is my worst trait
Omgosh the job thing.    Years ago i get called to the office for a manager not even on my shift (I worked days he worked and was in charge of overnights).  I had to wait for a few minutes while he was talking to one of my supervisors behind a closed door.  So entire time Im standing there waiting with thoughts going through my head of what I had done wrong.   It was for a job position interview.  I got promoted.  😂
First one so tru
Funniest one yet. 🤣
This dude is literally cracking up so hard and I am just laughing on the inside🤭🤭🤭😂😂
This has got to be the funniest one of ur videos
His laugh gets better and better
This guys laugh is faker than Kamala Harris’s
Man I love your laugh
Stop laughing it’s too much
The cleaning thing,  yep, that's me. 😟
My toxic trait: not sure if this is toxic, and you probably won’t be able to tell upon first meeting me, I’m actually introverted and pretty shy
The more I think about it my toxic trait is also the cleaning thing I don't yell though
My mom be like:think twice before you do something stupid My dad be like:you live only once just do it Me:... confused.....
My fiancé is so confused because I do the cleaning one. I'll be like "let's clean" then kick him out of the room after 5 minutes because he isn't "cleaning it right" then when I'm done I get mad at him for not helping and he's always sitting on the couch like 😐
The one about cleaning is absolutely me. I get mad when nobody helps me but then I get mad because they don't do it like I like it done so I end up doing it myself anyway and I have an attitude about it. Lol
Hello :D
😆 the best!
" I like ur personality" "It's a disorder" 👁👄👁I'm dying
Omg! My husband insisted on doing all the cooking and cleaning.. but complained that he had to do all the cooking and cleaning🤣🤣🤣. I just waited until he left the house so I could clean the way I wanted to.🤣
"I like your personality." "Thanks, it's a disorder." Literally every book character: hElLo pEaSaNtS
"My toxic trait is that I won't let you clean because its not clean unless i clean it but then I'll yell at you for not cleaning in" At first: *reads it casually * At second: **needs to re-read it to understand what was written bc there's alotta "cleaning" in it**
"i like your personality" "thanks its a disorder"    that was relatable
Lol
Me just 😂😂😂😂😆
These are truly THE MOST relatable memes I have ever seen!!! I love your videos! Keep them coming! 🤣
You laugh at everything 😄
So true.😅😂😅😂😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣
When my sister and I shared a room, she would get mad when I cleaned her side cause she didn't want me to move her stuff. But when I didn't clean her side she'd be like "oh only clean your side then OKAY"
OMG THAT DOG IS SO STUPIIIID
😂😂😂😂 personality disorder! Ive got borderline
Fake laughin ass nigga
When someone compliments you and you don't know how to react *the face*  Me: hey! You copying me?! 😂
The Harry Potter one  I think I talk to snakes you
Me: *sees a snake* Also me: *flies to planet Uranus* Me on planet Uranus: AAAAAAAAAAAH A SNAKE GET AWAY FROM ME!!!!!
I have that toxic trait! Sad but true 😂
I love your vids too much! More! 👍👍👍👍💖😝
omg the cleaning it but it's not clean is soooo true 😂😂😂
Him: hahahahahahahha   Me: not laughing at any of them
My toxic trait is walking behind people walk over the back of their foot and blame it on the other kid..... They shall feel my pain
The Joke isn't funny when he reads it to me 😭
My toxic trait is that cooking is a priority over you. “No, we can’t watch a movie, I’m making chicken piccata”
Istg it makes me so mad when ppl laugh at unfunny memes
I used come here for memes but now to see you laughing
Hey, u look nice today, here’s a flower” “eats flower”
*Eats flower*
Kk but the cleaning one has big auquarias vibes ngl
Every mother ever-"WHY THE FUCK HAVEN'T YOU HELPED ME CLEAN?!" You-"You won't let m-" Mother-"DONT TALK BACK TO ME!"
Did he say “facts to the max”?  I love that.
Me just screenshots the part where it says "My toxic traits" so I can show my mother then I be waiting for the"YOUR GROUNDED" speech 😂😂😂
The bit about cleaning is 100% my stepmom.
The same thing happens every time my boss calls me into her office: Her: can I see you for a minute Me: *frantically does over everything I could have possibly done wrong* ...sure Her: I know it's late notice, but can you stay an extra hour today?  Me: *silent sigh of relief* yep. Sure. No problem. Her: thank you so much! You're a big help. Me: *awkward nod and walk away to take anxiety pill*
The first is so relatable
FaCtS tO ThE mAx
My entire personality is based on the ckeaning ine
Bro when five year olds give you a card that makes you look fat
First one is from Taylor Swift 🤣
“Facts to the max”
Can u please do harry potter memes
Nobody: Me just looking at ben dying from every meme 😭
I can relate: My favourite part about going to school is assuming you’re in deeeeeeeeeeeeep trouble whenever the teacher wants to talk to you privately KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE
The second one is just the adult version of going to the principal’s office and being scared that you’re going to get yelled at.
My toxic trait is clicking the go button when i know its safe to make the drivers have a bad day
FACTS TO THE MAX😂
*FACTS TO THE MAXXXXX*
That last one tho
Me: literally laughing after watching him laugh 😭😂 FYI: I don't find the so said jokes funny
The fact that the first one described my life for the pass 9 years
Him saying the joke The last three words being in audible just laughing lol 😂
His laugh is so much more enthusiastic
The last one is so true 😂
BRITISH PEOPLE READING THE TITLE: 👁👄👁  For Americans: for us it looks like this 16/03/22
That first one tho 🤣
That cleaning thing though is toxic
My new favorite video 😂😂
I feel like these ones hit closest, not just for me but also for him.
The first one was hilarious!
The cleaning one is definitely my mom
It's gotten to a point that I like this guy's videos bro watching them
"Ahh your smile is so pretty" Me: uhm yes I know
I have my old best friends for helping me to be able to relate to the first one
Haas kas sii Haas kas si  Parsel tongue 🤣
The first one is not funny it’s actually sad
My toxic trait is I will want to talk to you, but until I'm finished talking, you will have your mouth shut. Now if you wanna talk to me, I'll be in my own universe, destroying, creating reality.
The cleaning part is me 100 percent.
Hahaha!! reverse for me, my boss was terrified everytime he called me into his office I would quit.
The toxic cleaning trait is sooooo me. Lololol.
I love the: thanks, It's a disorder 🤣
I get the cleaning one!!
320k like 🤯
No but, how do i act when people complement me ?!?! Seriously, tell me ?!
Did a mom really tweet abt cleaning🤣
That cleaning thing isnt a toxic trait, its my mom
I hate to be a killjoy, and I enjoy these, but it's not like bennelect is just randomly seeing these for the first time. He's accumulated it n is good at a fake laugh. It's a skill, man! My friend was SO freaked out when I showed him how easy I can dissolve into buckling laughter n then go NOPE. Like it called our entire relationship into question. Crazy guy. Needed to hear it.
The last one is totally a girl thing
Who tf watches these 🤷‍♂️
When does he never laugh and he makes me laugh when I see him laugh
Ayo on that cleaning one, I think I found my momma💀
The last one is so me I don't know how to react so I just say "thank you" and just stand there awkwardly  That's he many compliments I get I just get called cute sometimes tho but rarely 😂
My toxic trait is that I spend money like I’m rich… it sounds way worse than it is
I love your voice!
I like your personality Me: Uhh which one
Okay, jokes about shitty people aside, I really do wish I could talk to snakes. I could tell my Rosy boa that he's the bestest boy and ask my Cal King why he's such a dick
Every time I get called into the office I immediately start searching my mind for anything I may have done wrong and start going through the excuses I’m gonna say 😂 Does anybody else do this…? No…? Just me huh, alright then 🥴
Its not harry potter its actually harry poggers
Facts to the max is not my favorite thing to say 🤌
Triggered 😂
Dating is bad for Muslims they just married
Harry Potter part is literally real 🤣👏👏👏👏😂
The funny thing is that my dad got called to his bosses office but he actually got fired
I think my toxic trait is getting jealous very easily
"my favourite part about having a job is assuming you're fired every time your boss calls you into their office"   It's like when the teachers/principal call you AND ONLY YOU and you think you're in trouble 😝
Worst part is his fake laugh...
Criminal : wht are ur last words Ben : **laughs** Criminal : why are u laughing Ben : hold on I just thought of a mene
That's good stuff 😄
I was drinking water on the last one and I spit it back out 🤣
My toxic trait is my whole personality 😅
...but same with the cleaning one 😅😅😅
Sounds like my mother about cleaning the house. Seriously, birches how nothing gets cleaned.
God I love watching this dude just for his laugh 😆😂😍
My toxic trait is if you don't respond to me in 30 minute to an hour I will spam you're phone and cry
THAT ME... I'M DOWN WIT OCD!!! 🤣🤣
I’ve been scrolling through shorts for ages and finally found someone with good content
This random girl handed me a rose and I totally ate it in front of her she looked at me confused as fuck and I told her she knows how I feel now  I handed her the stem and she threw it at the back of my head as I walked away
He laughs but I'm kinda concerned for his mental health 😬
"Facts to the max" 🤣🤣🤣
my toxic trait isn't "something's wrong and you know it but i'm not telling you what", it's "something's wrong and we all know but i have no fucking clue what's wrong so we all have to put up with my current state" it's not toxic until i start getting snappy and none of us know what the hell to do
You know that voice inside your head that you have conversations with? Well mine is British and disagrees with everything I say
Yes, I so agree, while laughing, waIT whAT. hOW dID yOU kNOW!! My WHole LIfe In A SHort VIDeo.... LMFAO...😔😅🤣😂
Fax to the max
The job one is the same thing when you're sent some where and you think you're gonna be in big trouble but it turns out they just wanted to invite you too something
He is definitely a pro at fake laughing😭🤣🤣🤣
Omg I feel like he actually laughed for these lmao
Hes so annoying
I cannot stand it when someone can't talk a compliment....I CAN WITH NO PROBLEM AT ALL 🤗
I am the toxic trait of the clean thing. Ask my husband. Thank God he has learned to just walk away and love me anyways
the toxic trait one is basically me with my brother lol 😂
I love ur posts! U r my happy place! U have the best laugh!
My toxic trait is that I apologize way too much. I will just constantly casually ask if I’m being a nuisance. I will just casually call myself an idiot.
Can anyone explain the first one? 😅
How can you seriously do the same canned fake laugh over and over and over?  Try something else.
Ur cutee
When ever he laughs, he always looks to his left. Whats over there?
I was always worried about going to the office at my job too...ugh lol
The first one was the best ... it describes my life of talking to snakes
omg his laugh tho 😂
The cleaning post.... Totally me! LOL
I didnt get the Harry Potter tweet.
I am reading harry potter rn lol  I am at the page 376 of the third book but I already know the whole story bc is the 6th times that I read all the books
The dating one is on point 😂
I think that every time my boss wants to talk to me
😂
These laughs r so fake
My toxic trait is wanting affection but I hate social interactions and when people give me affection I push them away because I feel that I don’t deserve it.
Love it
"my toxic trait is i wont let you clean because its not clean unless i clean it but then yell at you for not cleaning"   fax
We have some snakes in the chat to i think
The dog
That one about cleaning gives out Levi Ackerman vibes
The clean freak perfectionist is my mom, I spend hours cleaning & it’s not yet enough for her to say thanks for helping, it’s always “you missed a spot” or “this is looks worse than before”.
This man is a demon
I feel the cleaning one
Somebody : do you have any pets at home? Me : yes Them : what are they? Me : My brother wich is a wild pet and my rabbit my home pet
First one be dark humor
My friend:I love your personality Meh: thanks Also meh: dieing inside because little do you know it's a disorder
The snake one is actually true lol
This man can laugh at any joke he's a legend
Laughs, looks down and then up and to the right. Every. Time lol
The dad one is so on point
That toxic treat one is my dad to the t
I’m jealous of Harry Potter because he gets to be around Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton)
That first one, big F
Snakes are cool though
The favorite part about having a job is like when you assume you are in bug trouble everytime you go to your principles office
Is it bad to tell your boss don't make my day or promise me things like that when they threaten to fire you
You laugh too much.  It loses its comedy.
Gg
or maybe that’s just dad talk for if you took your brain in for routine maintenance as in … you need help ❤️
Ohhhhh 100 percent on the cleaning one.
My toxic trait is I won't let u clean it because it is not clean unless I clean it but then I will yell at u for not clean ing
Wow it’s really amazing that me and that one guy have the same dad🤔
Lol my toxic trait is that I am soo judgement in my head I be like nice outfit,idiot then I think i say wtf did I just think that??? I am so judgmental and yet I talk way to much shit…😭okay I am not bad person just when I see something stupid or weird af In my head I am gonna be really judgmental 😌😅
I have 4/5 personalities depending on the time in the people I’m around
Jesus is coming soon repent and be baptized and you will be saved remember Jesus died for you God bless you God bless you all the end of times are near repent and be baptized and keep telling people about God and Jesus  for them to be saved to God blessings😁
The first one tho dayum
The first one was Westbrook when Kd went to the warriors
To everyone
Most of them is sooooooooooooo relatable
Hahaha
The cleaning statement is me
The toxic trait is basically me, just so you know. Also I'm a teen
Omg the toxic trait is my husband 😂😂
The fact its on my birthday makes me so happy lmfal
#facts_to_the_max
Hos can you STILL be laughing about these tweets
It was the same with your parents don’t pretend it’s a job thing. Every time your mom said “Come here” or “Family meeting” you start to think about everything you’ve ever done and what could of possible provoked her wrath and then she’s like “can you run and get the mail?”
“Fax to the max”
He's talking FACTS!
Is your entire channel reading a post than saying facts?
The last one is me and my bf. We compliment each other and burst into laughter because we feel good but embarrassed to say thank you. 😩❤️love him to bits though.
i relate to the cleaning one but if i trust you enough and spend a lot of time with you, what you clean is considered clean...unless i can visibly see what i think makes it dirty. ex: the bathroom of the house my family just moved into is dirty until my sister or mom clean it (or me but i didnt put me cos its abt them) BUT i could see a weird imprint of dirt in the shape of a mat on the bathtub floor and insist it is too dirts and refuse to use it no matter who cleans it cos the stain doesnt go away. i've found out that the stain has actually gone away and the only thing left is the imprint on the bathtub that was designed to have it...i still refuse to use it because i thought of it as dirty for so long that its stuck in my head and i've been using my sister's bathtub. my other sister (we share the 'dirty bathroom) also doesnt use that bathtub because my insistence of its dirty-ness has plagued her brain. yes, this example is true and still going on, its so bad that my dad is thinking of getting a new bathtub or replacing it with a shower.
Ok the first one was kinda dark 🙂✨🙂
Does he laugh after everything he says?
Every video is the same with ur anoyying laugh before the jokes even finished🤔😑 factz on facts dickweed
😃😁😂
My boss called me to the back once I thought she was firing me because a few days before they fired a couple of people but instead I got a raise
Yeah well if people talk to me they realize they're talking to somebody who is a snake because I'm extremely good at presenting ways to get out of stuff like a corrupt businessmen or for that matter crooked politician I seemingly have ways out of stuff and those are the only two people that I know that can pretty much get out of anything including lengthy prison sentences they might get one month in prison and that's about it maybe 24 hours in prison depending on who they know
“I like your personality”  “Which one?”
My humour is broken  Proof:fax to the max had me dying
Mr beast?
My boyfriend once asked if I’ve ever considered therapy then he wouldn’t answer me weird right
Bro that 5th one is every parents toxic traits
Why are your visit videos in light mode
Faxx to the maxxx
Ok, as a potterhead, I do not find that funny...
Also he said facts to the max
He doesnt think it's funny till he gets to the end of the thing
I honestly hate when others clean things because I then have the urge to clean it myself for every safe measure possible but I hate when they don't clean Because I'll most likely have to do it.  Don't fight me for this, my mind is a place nobody wants to understand not even myself
Oh yeah especially when u realize the snake u were talking to was yo bestfriend like?!?!?!? Rlly🙄😤🥲
This dude is totally on weed
THE FIRST ONE😂🤣😂
3rd one hits me deep in my soul 🤣
Dude will laugh at anything
My toxic trait is that I can easily/blantly lie to someone to their face causing people to believe everything I say whether it's a lie or not then I have to sit there and watch said person argue back with someone using my lie as their evidence 💀😭😭
This guy's fake laugh ...fuck off
The first one was SAVAGE 😂
The last one tho😂😂😂
So this is what people find entertainment? These aren't funny!
I still do not understand the 1st one.
The Harry Potter one got my cryin 😭😂💀
Start laughing, look down then look left. That seems to be the general technique.
Watching you is like looking at memes with a friend love it
😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"The person who wrote the first line knows exactly what life is"
THIS IS FUCKING BIT FUNNY!! WHAT KIND OF BULL SHIT ARE THESE VIDEOS?!? THEY ARE FUCKING NIT FUNNY
I feel that first one
The last one is so relatable 🤣...like I get second hand embarrassment whenever someone compliments me 😭🤚... but I am thankful that it hardly happens😐🌝
There was one single good manager when I worked at walmart. He was in charge of performance reviews one night. A coworker got called back and when he returned he informed me that this was his last shift as he had been fired. As the night went on, we got more stories like this, apparently random people getting axed that night. Then my turn came. My review was good, not perfect, but hardly atrocious. At the end, the manager took out a coin and told me to call it. I lost the flip. He then tells me that I'm to tell everyone else that I'm fired and this is my last shift, just to fuck with them. I gladly participated in this act of great evil.
Bro why this man have to laugh after every one
my part about the rapture is that this guys shit content will no longer be produced. fuck this horse shit
Do you find this amusing benjamin
It's not that funny I'm not even smiling while ur full on doing the spongebob yeeyee 30000 laugh
0:07
I didn't understand the 1st one can anyone explain it to me?
Yeah same my mom is also  the person  who doesn't  let u clean and yells at u for not cleaning it
His entire job is reading posts other people made, and when he’s reaching the end of the sentence, close his eyes, laugh in the fakest laugh possible, look down, then up to the left and open eyes. Maybe saying some shit like “FAX”, “FAX TO THE MAX” or “NO” or “YES”.
Idk If the bit is saying the word FACTS every video
Yooo! Just stop laughing u never read the sentence fully and just went BAHAHQHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHDGHENAAHAHA like whaaa!??! 🤔
Why do you laugh for stupid jokes
Why does he look to the left everytime after he read the meme. there clearly isn’t anyone.
My toxic trait is not letting you not wear a Montreal Canadiens hat while I’m a Toronto maple leafs fan
That toxic trait was like almost every mother in existence! I ask if she needs help and she says “No, I’m fine.” And then she gets mad because nobody ever helps around the house.
8
that is actually so unhealthy yo
Everytime he laughs he looks down and to his left
Yes talking to snakes lol
Benny boy you will be absorbed into the legion simply to entertain the people with a terrible sense of comedy
The happiest man in the universe love ur videos man 😂😂😂u change my mood soo fast ❤️
Bro the cleaning tweet is just too relatable.
THE SECOND ONE OMG😂😂😂
*fax to the max* fax
If you tell a joke and this man somehow doesn't laugh then you're a failure
Fun fact:He gets paid for reading words and laughing but people like me still enjoy it 😂😂
Today is mah birthday
Ur laugh tho, so intoxicating. Love it
Am I the only one who didn't find the    tweets funny at all?
I feel like this guy's chin grows with every fake laugh
I wanna see an uncut version of his videos
The fact that 3/16 is my b-day
0:32
I'm glad you think your funny
That last one tho
Whenever he laughs, his head either goes up, to the side, or down. I wonder what he is looking at? 🤔
That compliments one is so true bc us boys just don’t get that many compliments
How are any of these funny
Sheeeesh the dad one is so relatable
🤣🤣🤣🤣
The first one tho 🤣🤣🤣🤣 but the 3 ones after the job prob are just me 👁️👄👁️👌🏻 ✨🤣🤣
Can someone please explain the first thing he said?
Lindsay is on to something
The first one is my life
My toxic trait is punching women for not being 2d sorry mate
Me: listening to my father by JAX also me: taking a shit
I didn't understand most of the jokes but I still see to hear the 'ELITE'
My dad constantly says I'm cute or pretty and me, not understanding proper how reactions work, just gives a flustered laugh or giggle.
Honestly tho, Best. Laugh. Ever. 😂
My mom with the cleaning one tho . . .
Kinda cringe
There’s 202 likes……
The second one describes me perfectly
Have you noticed that he starts laughing at the last 2 words 😂😂
Every time my boss calls me into his office, I instantly think if I did something bad
I despise his fake laugh
Please, no compliments. I'm allergic, I will go into shock 😲 that's why I always carry my medical smoking device. PUFFING POOOWWWEEEERR!!
Facts to the max I love that
How do I stop seeing this dude, not funny in the slightest and annoying as fuck
Bens comment section on yt: 🥰🥺🤨 Benny boys comment section on tt: 👹💀🔪
The cleaning one is my parents especially my mom😂✋💜
You know what? I don’t even mind this guy anymore. I now find it funny that a lot of the stuff Hes  laughing at and relating to is either by women, for women, or both. And I can appreciate a man who gets the struggle, the little ones
I just get nervous when my mom calls me into her room-.-
personality disorders shouldn’t be taken as jokes 😃
Imagine laughing for thousands of people when you don't even get the joke ,it would have happened sometime 🙂
Hi god bless
Benny boy... we are in your closet 👹
We live in your walls
I’ve heard the first one way too many times… 🙄
'It's actually happened to me' No you don't  You don't have a job that's why you're doing that shit
LMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 LITERALLY ROLLING AROUND
Is it me, or have I been living like Harry Potter when I didn't realize it? 😅🤣😏
I am the only one that find his laugh cringy, instead of funny? It ruins it for me, like laugh tracks in shows.
I like the funny tweets, but not the fake laugh... So whenever I'm scrolling through shorts and this dude comes up. I just mute my phone and read the tweets to myself.
my toxic trait is that i will suddenly start arguing then just say "roll with the argument i'll stop at some point"
I'll probably be fired easily. I'm shy, and have been shyin' myself away.
Don’t do snakes like that
Benjamin, don’t look behind you
On multiple occasions, if someone compliments me, I’ll wish them happy birthday or merry Christmas or something like that
I swear whenever i see this guy he just puts me in a better mood
Is it just me who think marrying/love is overrated. Im more focused on getting the bread then spreading them legs 👀
Why does this dude look like a knock off mr. Beast
I was raised by one 🤣🤣🤣🤣
My man looks around to see if anyone is laughing with him
I just realized...I have also been talking to snakes all this while
The first one was actually taken from a girl's photobook
The job one with the assume firing,oh i feel that 😳
"facts to the max!!" stfu dude that sounds so stupid
Aye you should start a podcast
I wish i could laugh at jokes and make money
I don't know the one about the dad and a concerning way asking about taking his car in for routine maintenance I don't know in a way that could be a way to gauge how bad the situation was because if it was so bad that he can't even get his car maintained that could be a pretty big issue seeing how expensive car maintenance can be most of the time
This is bad but it's a basically good tho and funny a little
There is no hiding benny boi we are coming
🤣
This guy laughs at butter being spread on toast
This was posted on my birthday
Laurazepam has me cracking up more than her tweet. That name is brilliant!
Every time I watch these videos, the more faith I lose for humanity
3. Tru, absolutely tru
Damn...that second one. That's why I'm going back to school and going to create a psychogy clinic once I get my PhD. Fuck you old bosses.
I wanna talk to snakes :(
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow, thank you for adding nothing to these tweets👍🏻
where is he finding the most RELATABLE TWEETS?! like. mood level 100
Too easy
We are all coming for you benny boy
Parents traits are when they say "answer me" and also "are you talking back"
Sometimes you have to know someone for months to get to know their favorite word but here you just have to watch one of his videos
If I have something that could be called a toxic trait is me wanting to have loved ones AROUND. No touchy, sometimes no talky. Just therey
Last one: man be like
its really not funny.
ELEET
I love how funny you think stuff is that you have probably read 20 times to be able to read them on camera. Your laugh is great.
Your cringe
When someone is comlimenting me for drawing good I'm like: fake smile🙂
“When your watching a video and some funny scene comes up abd your friend laughs for a few minutes and you just start fake laughing so your friend doesn’t think they are weird for laughing at a small joke too much”  Me: 😀 hahaha- My friend: 🤣🤣 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA-
"Reading *Funny* Tweets" ...   "Reading Tweets"             ...
Back in middle school there is a girl that compliment's me sayin that i have a good voice, and i don't know how to act so i feckin bit my steel ruler and act like a dog
I already think dying alone is not that bad
When someone compliments you 😭
I committed arson This guy: faxxxx hahahhahah fax fax fax
its not the jokes that makes me laugh.... its his laugh that motivates me to laugh
The 1st one is 0% funny
Yeah I was getting my nails done and the lady says mmmhh u smell like coconuts. I said umm thanks ?
Him: looking at his side's and saying "it actually happens" Furniture: huh? 👁️👄👁️
I wish I could bottle and sell this dudes happiness
How is that cleaning part relatable
Last one hit like a stone in the face 🤜🤕
Damn I really like this videos 🤣
Once a friend said "you look beautiful" and i literally said "WHAT don't say that (like actually telling him to not tell me that ever again) it makes me feel odd" something is wrong with me
That guy laugh for me before I even realise I have to laugh
The last one! That's ME
I used to be jealous of harry Potter for being able to talk to snakes turns out I've been doing it for years  Reply  🙋 or 🙋‍♂️ if you get it
The ‘clean’ one is so me..I’ll tell someone to clean something but then I tell them to get out because they don’t how to clean then I yell at them for not cleaning
“ I like your personality “ “Thanks, it’s a disorder”  Ok, I’m definitely doing that because it’s so true
"I like your personality" "Thanks, it's a disorder" 💀💀💀 pleaseee
The personality one reminds me of when teachers would always say they liked how my cheeks were always pink n blushie and I'd be thinking "thanks, it's a skin condition"
Me : *Parseltongue* You: Huh? Me: I am a GOD!!!
The First one is absolute facts
First one can relate
my toxic trait is not wanting to talk to anyone but then get upset if im alone
Last one that's me 🙂
people often call me names like f*g or some lgbt+ slur and I just take it as a complement because words can't cut me down only axes can
The last one I can’t 😂🤣
His laugh is funnier than the actual jokes🤣🤣
And there are those people who are like  "Thanks, it's a disorder" **doesn't have a disorder**
Anyone else think he should react to shower thoughts?
The one about cleaning describes my mom to the bone. It’s so FUCKING FRUSTARTING.
My toxic trate is not talking to anyone and getting angry for no reason and then wondering why no one wants to talk to me 😂
The snake one 😂🤣🤣
Your laugh brings a smile on my face, so always laugh and be happy and goofy☺️☺️☺️
Most of these aren't that funny..
I used to be jealous of Harry Potter for beeing able to talk to snakes, but turns out I can literaly comunicate with the trees (when they want to, of course)
The second one is the same thing about school when you go into the office you think your in trouble
Me: goes to brothers room and stands by the door Him: you good? Me: No, i just went through a mental breakdown.
Lmao yess everytime I get  called by my boss I ALWAYS ASK am I in trouble ESPECIALLY when they be like take a seat 😂.  But I’m never in trouble 😂
I don't get the first one.
Harry potter thought he was special cause he could talk to snakes bitch nah hes average pretty sure everyone can
The toxic trait one is same with me
I don’t get the date
Fun fact: a way to say sos with lights or eyes you blink fast three times and you blink slow three times (preferably a long pause is used between the repeating pattern)
The one where boss calls you and you feel like you are going to get fired is so relatable..🤭  now that I have to wfh whenever my boss calls for a 1on1 unscheduled meeting  I am like "what did I do?? Why is he calling me ? Do others in my team have a meeting too"😅
The clean one is me. Lmfao.
Bruh did someone notice that this guy is making himself laugh for the video i mean some of them are not that funny ya know just sayin
fAcTs tO tHe mAx
Is it me or does he always look to the other side like he’s talking to somebody else
Yup totally me  Especially 4 and 5
Or you're in trouble every time uu go to the principals office 😂😂
Why is the Harry Potter, toxic traits and complement so true
the clean and compliment part made me laugh
That last one is me when people says that im so big since they met me when i was like 1 yr old
i really wasn’t expecting to see fiona gallagher 😯
The cleaning part tho... like AR U STALKING ME?
The last one actually happened to me when I was out one time, I got complimented by an old dude I didn’t even know and did not know how to react to it
It's not only one disorder baby, they're multiple and always growing :D
Me thinking of something exciting to do 30 seconds later forgot what it was
No one Him: ✨fAx tO ThE mAx✨
Bruh, your HILARIOUS  keep it up
Wait a minute... snakes don't have ears there for Can't hear
can't! I heard the first one*  OBANI IGURO YOU THERE???
Hate yu
Loving the sound of his laugh
I relate to the 3rd ll ast one SOO much
I strongly dislike when some people say they have a disorder just to seem relatable.  Having a hard time doesn’t mean you have a disorder.   Being sad doesn’t mean you have depression or being unmotivated to go to school doesn’t mean you’re depressed. It might be that school isn’t fun, you’re not learning something new or interesting, it’s too repetitive and that you’re just generally school tired.  Just because you’re a perfectionist or you like having your things organized doesn’t mean you have OCD.  Just because someone acts a little different from what you usually see doesn’t mean they have autism.  Just because someone doesn’t talk a lot or don’t like to talk or socialize much doesn’t mean they have social anxiety. (They might just be introverted)  Seeing people joke with disorders are very disturbing, because most of them don’t have the disorder they joke about.  Most of the disorders are serious and shouldn’t be joked about.  I know the thing in the video was just meant as a joke but it’s kinda annoying seeing it being a trend to say you have a disorder.  Don’t attack me in the comments because I said my opinion.  Answer respectfully and I know a lot of people are struggling with disorders and we should help them as much as possible. If you struggle go see/ask a professional or someone you love for help. It’s not a battle you should fight yourself.  (Yes, I do have a disorder and if you get the right help from professional or loved ones. You can have a functioning/“normal” life.)
This actually happened to me 🤣 geico. I hope your life is better for it !
im convinced we all have the same father
"Thanks, it's a disorder."  Accurate pfft
I have a pet snake I honestly love her
My toxic trait is I struggle to trust you unless you can prove I can. But even when you do I overthink it.  Also I get offended if you leave me on read or take forever to respond to a question and answer when I no longer need and answer. But I feel like everyone gets annoyed by that.  Also you have to somewhat like Taylor Swift
The date is 3/16/21 there aren't 16 months
I dare you to read a tweet without laughing till the tweet is over😂
Snake:o
My toxic trait is when someone does something like a small mistake like tapping or breathing on me i would flip-
I have Asberger's. Now I'm with someone. Boom.
That last one got me
This young man had georgeous eyes.
My toxic trait is that if you smell I will tell you both in private or public (bad smells give me extreme cluster migraines)
I really don't like his laugh and it seems fake too
My talk sickness is probably me bragging that I was a baby I hit my head twice I’m not sure why I brag about that I just do
Some one complimented me and i got so what the hell i thought they were lying so was social distancing with them
Tell me you're forcing your laugh without telling me you're forcing your laugh
"I like your personality" "thanks its a disorder" i-
I'll be having the worst day and watching you laugh at these already funny things always makes me laugh harder and resets my mood 😂😂😂
Persone*tell me a little about your self Me*what do you want my trama or my favorite color
My toxic trait is I want affection but I don’t like being touched
🖤🖤🖤
Me finding the one he posted on my bday be like...
"My toxic trait is I won't let you clean because it's not clean unless i clean it, but then yell at you for not cleaning" THAT'S MY GRANDMOTHER 1000%
"It's a disorder" Him: fAcTs tO tHe mAx!!!
The 1st one    Laugh thru the pain my guy.... Laugh through it..
Someone compliments me im Just like okay or yes.
Izzy Swagger i can relate 100%
I was jealous of Harry Potter, too. For him having an invisibility cloak, but then I realised that Harry the Dumbass didn't go to a girls toilet
2nd 1 is me whith my brothers and the house
Ppl: your so forgetful its kinda funny Me: thx its called ADHD
The best part about renting is being so poor you can't go anywhere else and potentially ending up homeless if the agent or landlord has a bad day.  The worst part of deciding on murder or suicide when you're booted out.
fionaaaa
"My toxic trait is I won't let you clean because it's not clean unless I clean it, but then yell at you for not cleaning it" Literally me 😅
"My toxic trait is I wont let you clean cause it's not clean unless I clean it. But then I yell at you for not cleaning"  Levi??? 👁👄👁
That last 1 is me through and through
Why did I think of captain Levi as soon as I heard that cleaning one
My toxic trait is that I like cuddles but I won't let you touch me
Friends are snakes
When someone compliments me I act completely different bc I don't want to ruin whatever I did
The first one got me
Your fake laughs are so fkg anoying, jesus, intentionally or not you're making me plan your funeral
Lol
My toxic trait is not being empathetic or sympathetic towards anyone to the point where I get my mental health and self esteem completely destroyed by other people because idc about other peoples issues and problems cause they remind me of my own and I don’t want to think about 🥲
The cleaning one is me all the way 👌🏾
Your laugh is funnier than the jokes
MY STEP MOM 24 7 IS IN THERE TAKE A GESS
Anyone else notice how he can never finish the sentence without laughing
"My toxic trait is I won't let you clean because its not clean unless I clean it, but then I yell at you for not cleaning."  Me: 👁👄👁 ARE YOU THE FBI
The 5th one is mothers and you can't tell me im wrong
The toxic trait...I have 1000%😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why y'all gotta disrespect snakes like that man.
My BF: Dark jokes r funny Me: *Makes one directed at myself* My BF: *NO!*
"My toxic trait is I won't let you clean because it's not clean unless I clean it, but I will yell at you for not cleaning"  I've never find something more related to me than this.
My toxic trait is everything i do
I laughed 😂
Someone: “You are beautiful!” Me: “Why are you lying..?”
Stop fake laughing non of this is funny
:)
Dating is great so u don't have to die alone
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HIS LAUGH
I think I need a mental test yesterday I asked myself a question and I didn't hear the question so I said repeat that
Omg every time they call me in I think I'm in trouble, but I'm a teacher's pet so there's no way that could ever be the case.
The last one-
Lol did anybody recognize Fiona Gallagher😂
This is the most fake laughter of all times👁👄👁
He can’t finish a sentence with out that laugh uhhhuhhuuhihhu! Like uh ok 👌
It's funny because it's true
Some of these would be actually funny if he didn't laugh like a dumbass after  every one
I am feeling the dating one. Not enough time in the world to deal with that kind of shit
Nobody:  Him reads a comment and laughs before it is over says fax and looks down and then to his left
2008 was the worst year of my life.
i can relate to the harry potter one HAHA
"My toxix trait Is I won't per You clan because it's not clean Unless I clean It, but the I'll yell at you for not cleaning" * Levi Ackerman joined the chat*
That's like, every mother ever   You know which one I'm talking about
The cleaning one: so me
Where do u look after laughing, ur eyes just wander off??
My toxic trait is clinging to you for a whole week and then wanting nothing to do with you for a week. Or I'll be talking to someone and I've been affectionate but then I'll just shut off my emotions and not respond to them.
"FaX to the MhaaAx"
My toxic trait is telling people they're drawing something wrong or they need to fix a detail when they're showing me their art and I had no business doing so- but it's getting better now, I used to do it a lot but I've matured as both an artist and as a person so it only happens rarely :)
These fake laughs tho
Why tf he laugh at every thing he hears
I couldn't comment on the video so I'm going to complain here. It was a little girl getting an eye surgery to fix her eyes.  Meanwhile while the child was in immense pain the parent shoved a camera in their face for a tik tok.  There is no hope left for humanity.
Facts to the Max
It’s the first one for me.
The cleaning one is what my mom does😂😭
Some laughs seem fake ngl🥺
Lmao that’s how I feel when I get a call from my dad and I start immediately thinking about all the stuff I did bad and which one he could’ve found out when it turns out he has a simple question like “did your sister get off the bus” lmao
the toxic trait one is literally me in a nutshell
Man I just love this guys laugh like I could acc listen to it to get to sleep
The cleaning one just sounds like a mom
this mans formula: read first 80% of tweet, laugh-read the last 20%, laugh while looking down, then right or left (typically right)
Sheesh Mr.beast 😂🤔🤣
Harry, you are not the only one
Me after living at a all girls school
The first one... i call them NEIGHBORS.
The cleaning one is basically me and my brother.
New catch phrase unlocked: Fax to tha Max! 😎
Someone please explain the first one??
Cleaning facts
My girl does that she literally did that today she's like your lazy you never help me hmmm that's becouse every time I try to she says I clean wrong or put groceries away wrong etc

God Bless!!!
I can't get you to see my tweets so here goes: When you call me and I say I am eating and say I'll call you back  I am not I am just pooping
This guys job is to read and laugh
What does the first one mean
The second one hit me hard because i was brought into the office with my boss and supervisor and i was so worried i started crying. This the first time that happened to me so i didnt know what to do
Hey I am jealous of Harry to for taking to snakes
The fifth one reminds me of mom so much!! Today she told me to clean my room and then when I started cleaning she came in my room and said I was doing it wrong and did it herself.
mom: go get the flour  me:ok me again: comes with a flower
Idk why but this guys fake laugh is so nice
My guy just said fax to the max 😭
"MY toxic trait is the fact when I come to your house without strict parents I get scared for you and yell so loud they are now strict to me"
Him "Facts to the Max" Me "lol😆
I can hear your fan running xD
My toxic trait is, if I ask for a chip, don't give it to me, I will eat your whole bag in 5 seconds and there is no stopping me, then I will yell at you for finishing the chips
✨facts to the max✨
I cant watch you with a serious face 😂😂
When it’s your birthday when this was posted
Omg the first one why is that me
The first one 🤣💀 It's true tho..
Bye :D xD
I hate this guy
I love the hp one
The best part is when you watch videos about people not finding "the one" while the only people you've been with a person who's grampa said it's illegal to date under 18, another who's a short guy who said he has many EXs but ya don't believe him till after ya break up, and third who says they ain't ready after awhile of dating. Then your best friend who you finally figured out ya like em after 5 years, tell them, and not get with em till a year later but it's the best relationship ya ever had. Sorry I texted this I just like talking about stuff...might delete...not sure
Pffft- that last one is so me lmaoo
Number 5: my mom saying to that person "are you trying to impersonate me?"
No one: Ben in every video:FACTS
I have that exact cleaning toxic trait...I'm sorry, I'm just sorry.
That second one is me omfg
My toxic trait is that I am constantly vibing
-Reads instructions to make Mac and cheese *fake Jimmy Fallon laugh*
My man be looking like Mr Beast 2
The cleaning one is like levi ackerman from aot
Is he high or sum? Shit wasn’t funny
Can u pls stop fake laughing... it gets annoying
The Harry Potter one tho😂
Trust me I used to be so confused why Harry Potter would run into walls to get to a train station but turns out I have been doing it my whole life but into glass doors ☠️
*Boss calls you into office*  You: oh am I finally gonna be fired  Boss: *you're promoted*
That last one is me and So is that first one
My toxic trait is I dont let anybody buy things for me because it makes me uncomfortable. It just makes me feel weird and also makes me feel bad. One time while I was spending the night at my friends house I offered to pay for the 12 oz bottle of soda her mom got for me.........
Can we just appreciate how he’s making a living out of reading tweets 😂😂
That's not funeh
My reaction through this video was 😐
FAX
Starts laughing on last line of the tweet Looks down Looks left Continues with the next one
"Fact to the max" on a thing about bpd makes little sense cos the majority of people dont have it but ok-
Facts to the maxxx
Actually I despise compliments nowadays   Like I never ever got compliments and then people started giving me them and I have no idea how to act like, Do you reply with thanks or Do you just smile and nod or what?-
“Thanks, it’s a disorder” Me with OCPD:...............
The  last  has happened to me every time.
Me when some stranger tells me my pastel outfit is cute: bravo six, going pastel for the entire summer
He was overreacting
My toxic trait: My mouth  My best trait: My mouth
So every mother
The 16 was my B-day 😁
I just watch these for his laugh tbh
"My toxic trait is I will let you claim because it's not clean unless I clean it but then yell at you for not cleaning" THIS IS MY 2 SISTERS OMFG, Me and my brother have to deal with them all the time, they think just like this 💀
The fact that JKR is such a bitch that whenever I see the name Harry potter I get slightly offended inside
The second one is the equivalent to when the principal calls your parents for good behavior
My Mom when she says for my ONLY to clean my room and NOTHING else: Her:"GO CLEAN THE KITCHEN TOLIT CABINS AND THE. WHOLE HOUSE AND I WANT YOU TO REPAINT IT"  Me:You only said for me to clean my room though  Her:NO I DIDN'T *Her yelling for no reason* Me: SENSE ITS YO HOUSE YOU GO CLEAN IT YOU ALWAYS ON THAT PHONE OF YOURS SENSE YOU PAY RENT AND BILLS HOW ABOUT YOU DO IT-
69k likes.... nice
69K LIKES OOOOH
Sir, why aren’t you verified? Like, I’ve never heard an untruth come from your mouth😌
I don't think this guy gets the "jokes " because even if it's something very normal like "I eat bananas" this guy will be like "hAhHa fAcS" :/
I don't know why I get depressed vibes from this man. I hope u are okay 😔
The last one tho😂
The first one lmaoo
Nu
I’m that last one 😂
THAT CLEANING ONE IS EVERY MOM ON THE PLANET
You no that when your mom tells you to clean your room one time I was have a fight over cleaning my room so this what my moo said go clean your room I said no she says it's my house then I said this then go clean  it😂😂😂😆👍
FACTS
Facks
That second one is the same as thinking you about to get a whooping every time your black parent calls you
i just realized that my toxic trait is that i won't let you clean it because it's not clean unless I clean but i get mad for you not cleaning it.  😳
i bet this guy laughs at amy schumer jokes
Me and a friend worked together. He was getting drug tested and asked if I would pee for him. I said yes and peed in a small water bottle for him. He came out and said thanks man I passed. They call me in to take one. I failed....
LOL
The cleaning one is every mother that has ever lived
The last one just- so true
Lol I have a personal disorder called IDGAF and LMAO 😂😂😂
I don’t get the first one can someone explain
The boss one is me, but most of the time she's just asking if I want food or if I'll go next door to get her some
i finally figured out what his favourite word is! FACTS! *pun intended*
The first one hits hard.
*the last one* : Just eat your problems away my dude, eat them all away..
"facts to the max!!"  Bentellect- 2021
how does this dude have such a positive like/dislike ratio???
That moment when you realize you can read the tweet faster than him It’s a joke not an insult
Might as well just turn over and die after watching this, trying to do a practice STAAR but too busy watching these instead
Numbers 134 and 5 tho 💀💀💀💀💀
Is anybody gonna point out that the name of the chick who assumes she's getting fired is "Laurazepam"?  Stop nodding out at work, you won't get fired 😅
Lol
The disorder is literally me 100%
We Stan a Harry Potter joke
The cleaning one describes me so accurately
One that's not funny just sad that happens to me  Me: omg I did 20k steps today Also me : *realizes that them steps were just from going back and forth to the kitchen*
hahahah but do you know what would be really funny?       If EVERY SINGLE VID YOU POST YOU DIDNT SAY THE WORD “facts”
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂so funny
Female Police Officer: “You Are So Kind! Thank You Very Much!” A female police officer was really pleased when she received a phone call from a Falun Gong practitioner, who told her a way to pull through the coronavirus catastrophe.  She eagerly agreed to quit the CCP organizations after the practitioner explained to her the importance of doing so.  “I want to quit, right now! I didn't believe what Falun Gong was telling us in the past. Now I know everything you told me is true. I feel there is hope in life.”  The practitioner also explained to her the importance of her repaying the crimes she had committed in participating in the persecution of Falun Gong by starting to do the right things, such as treating Falun Gong practitioners kindly and telling her colleagues to do the same. The officer said she would certainly do so.  “You can also tell your family, your colleagues and neighbors to sincerely recite 'Falun Dafa is good. Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good' as these two precious phrases can help cleanse your environment, and if more people are doing this, wouldn't they also be safe?”  “You're so kind,” the officer said while obviously choked up with gratitude, “I will definitely do as you said. Thank you so much!”
I can’t tell if it’s what he’s reading that’s making him laugh. Or just the fact he’s getting to the end of a sentence... I can’t decide
Is that supposed to be an ironic laugh? I hope so
The cleaning one reminds me of when my mom would have us as kids help her fold clothes just to refold them, and when we asked why she said well I just wanted your help 😭😂
Wait,Mr Beast?  Ehat you do in here?
my mother is the last one 🥲👏🏽
This guy looks serious, these people were lucky in making him laugh.
This guy will laugh at anything and I love it.
This guys laugh is so fake
The side of the shorts is new
The one where the dog eats the flower is relatable to me. Today my teacher (who is female) said I looked different without a sweatshirt on and said I was tiny-
The posts were kinda funny still he started losing his shit over em.
None of these are that funny.
So true tho
what has youtube done to yt shorts it looks ugly and too much like tiktok now
Fax to the max That actually happens    ಠ ل͟ ಠ oh really
ok it’s not  t͟͟h͟͟a͟͟t͟͟  funny. by now your probably just forcing yourself to laugh...
is this real? like, who actually reads these and laughs that hard?? all of these misc social media posts feel so generic and from like 2013, who on earth still has this sense of humor lmao
you look like scooby do😂😅
Lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don’t get the first one
not funny
The cleaning one is my mom 200% i clean then she says i didnt clean because o dont watch her clean and learn. Thats because im not gonna stare at you tey to get a stain out of dishes for 30 minutes-_-
I have been talking to snakes, and female dogs, and actual animals like  bark bark dogs🐶 and actual snakes 🐍 honestly if fish could talk id be a fish because they look like they dont shut up like me ♥️🐟
This guy sounds like the exterminator from Over The Hedge
...... Baahahahahahahahahahhahhahahah he didn't even say or do anything bahahahhahahahhhHzahshzhBzkflogrobs... This guy
I had no idea that the person I'm married to exists outside of this home.....the toxic cleaning person is my wife. I want a divorce alot.
Bruh this guy is annoying asf y'all can't tell those laughs are fake
where tf is the funny
Wow I needed this
I honestly do not want to date anyone... It's to much work
These tweets literally aren’t funny. You’d have to be so high to actually laugh the way he does. Its so forced
My favourite part of this generation is becoming famous reacting to low quality 'comedy'.
I dont think there iz a need to laf at evrey one
That cleaning one is LITTERALY me with my brothers because whenever my dad asks us to clean the living room they say they are done the I come in and I’m like OMG YOU GUYS DID HORRIBLE so then I fix it but then if they don’t help I get mad 😂😂
U aint funny
Thing is all these funny tweets are just depressing and putting yourself down and undervaluing yourself, no wonder we are growing up with mental health issues but hey let’s make a funny tweet about it instead of dealing with it
The last one is so me! When i launged at end my parenst were like : 👁️👄👁️
U can do better
I think we're all jealous of Harry Potter
This guy makes me cringe so hard-
Literally makes everything less funny
🌟 It’s the fake laughing for me 🌟
That cleaning one is so true-
😐
This guys videos are just him reading semi funny tweets and fake laughing and saying facts
So.. does he just laugh at anything?
Ah yes forced laughter is a natural phenomenon that happens to people who want clout. It is weird what some clout can do to a person
“Tom Brady’s distant cousin reads Twitter tweets”
OH MY GOSH THE SECOND ONE IS SO ACCURATE 😂😂😂😂
Facts. If only people believed me. indeed!
So this guy just takes other peoples content and laughs at it, so inspirational🥺
Me that whole time 😐😐😐😐
Why is this cringe in my recommended
Its not funny
This is the definition of lazy content
Damn, that was hilarious😐
Why has this turned up on my feed? 3 minutes of a guy fake laughing to unfunny jokes for money... Quick look at his videos... There all like this one. What people will do for a bit of money...
possibly the lowest effort video.  all this guy is doing is taking other people’s jokes and using it to make money for himself.  i really hate when people do this
YouTube became tik tok...
He’s trending because he’s reading tweets and laughing
I love his vibe lol, I wish I could be his friend.
I'm gonna die alone. It's a fact
Not funny
His laugh shows his pain
"My toxic trait is I won't let you clean because it's not clean unless I clean it, but then I'll yell at you for not cleaning"  My dumb self: Are you Levi Ackerman?
Why do i feel like when he was reading the cleaning one it reminded me of Levi Ackerman 👁👄👁
Someone can say anything and he’d be like “HJXJCJJIS FACTS!!! FACTS!!!” He is honestly so annoying and it’s obvious he isn’t really laughing
Yessss I felt allll of theseeee!!!!!!!!!!
Why whenever bro read this I watch this I feel like I’m like dying inside because he seems like he’s having so much fun
fax to the max
Okay that cleaning one is so tru
Me: **Hears Harry Potter**  Also me: **Looks up** I have been summoned.
The reality we can't ignore;  1. When you die the real you( the spirit inside your body) either goes to Heaven or hell. 2. Who goes to hell? those who don't believe at Christ as the savior. e. Who goes to Heaven? Those who believe at Christ as the savior.   Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.  Hebrews 10:4, 10 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  In other words if you want to go to heaven after your death you must confess with your mouth and believe that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.  After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  Romans 6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
Lol
Facts **drops microphone**
it’s funny until he reads them 🧍🏽‍♀️😐
I forgot to laugh but he didn't
Professional fake-laughs
😐
This guy forces laughs 24/7. Theres never a video that he doesn't.
It’s not that funny you have a laughing problem😐
None of these are actually funny, not once have i laughed at any of these, i’m so glad youtube gave me the ability to “never recommend this channel again” please get better content
fr i mean when i get a compliment, i feel if i deny it i’ll sound like i need more. if i accept they’ll be like “ur pretty” “thanks” like- so i usually go with the most simple one “ur pretty” thanks so are you!”     anyways, you’re beautiful.
✨ FaCtS To ThE MaX ✨
this was uploaded on my birthdayyyy
I hate it becouse he is faking the laugh-
THESE TWEETS ARE SO TRUE
Is this the guy who made that video saying “my head does not look like a sodding tic tac?”
When you don’t get the joke..
When you realize YouTube's turning into tiktok
Dude the first one is Big Factssssss 😂😂
where's the funny
Bro, the second tweet gave me flashbacks 😅
Why does he wheeze at the end of every tweet like I don’t find it funny
Why why are you laughing
What is this weird update!?
😂😂😂
Heyyyy, can you block me? Like for real, I dont know how to and I keep seeing your videos, thanks 👍
Ok so my personality is actually a disorder it’s called ADHD but I like having it no it’s not something that can be cured it’s the way my brain is and that’s what most people don’t get that ever since I was diagnosed with ADHD my mom as understood and a lot of people think that it can be cured but it can’t it’s what makes me me
I’m still working with my vids
If you guys wanna watch me vids my channel is called strawberry cake!
GOD IS GOOD
Dude the one about dating is true 🖐😩😂
Well the first one I loved if you can't tell by my user name I love Harry Potter
They were all trash and your fake laughing is unconvincing. Go get a job you loser
Funny story: so my friend sent a screenshot of the toxic trait one to a group chat with me and most of my friends and it led to an entire conversation consisting of us listing all of our toxic traits and discovering we are more toxic than we thought
Can we talk about the pattern im seein here, at the end of the joke he starts wheezing and then laughs it’s fake, we’ve been duped!
Bruh what happened to original shorts the things are on the sides!
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUTUBE SHORTS! Ahhhh they are turning it into tik tok jeesh (not this guy im subbed) but everything is the sameee
I hate these because they are always fake reactions but you do you
Moms  all the time: Joey clean your room Me: *makes my bed and clean*  Mom: I said clean your room not garbage your room Me: but I made my bed and put in my clothes in the closet 🤨
how do people enjoy this. not to hate on this guy but forcefully laughing at everything is just obnoxious. past my time i guess
Lol people like my personality but part of it is a disorder so.....
Why is the shorts on YouTube like tik Tom
Why did youtube change
I find this guy slightly irritating but I like watching the video some of them are funny, but you go man, at least you didn’t stop just cuz people told u to. 💜❤️
these are so funny
Why does YouTube look like tiktok now 🤦‍♀️
Personally I find this unwatchable because of the laughs but I was pleasantly surprised to find the comments full of people sharing the laughter. Do what ever makes you happy, especially if it is bringing happiness to others.
BRI YouTube is turning into tiktok
Cancel this guy already 😒
Okay i love the first one cuz it has harry Potter 🙃
This guy always after every clip looks down and then left and it bugs the sh*t out of me
The first one hit different 😂😌
Hilarious
Unable to find funny
Why are all over these so relatable?? Someone tell me plz🤔
Youtubes new update is trying to be tiktok
Facts
Content
I have a crush but he farted on me
NOOOOO YOUTUBE HAS NOW TUNED INTO TIK TOK TIK TOK IS TAKING OVER THE WORLD 😭😭🤚
This too relatable
Didnt Billie Eilish fuck him up
why it look like that
First one is amazing 😂
That fake laugh as fake as the class thot’s test results
Bruh are freaking funny 🤣😂🤣🤣🤣
Me: hey mr do you have oculas quest here.   Him: oh ***k you too.   Me:😒
OK are used to do the thing where you think you’re fired but it was actually with detention, every time the principal called me up in the office I was like am I being suspended or expelled put in detention or what?
anyone else like and comment stuff on the side instead the bottom-
My toxic trait is telling people to stop humming, singing, fiddling or talking loudly when I literally do it. Worst part is that my friend behind me needs to fiddle to concentrate and she hums when she's bored
Its kind of just stealing tweets and laughing at then for clout
Fake ass laughs
Tbh I kinda wanted to punch him when he said fax to the max. 🙃
Did he smoke a blond before making the video? He looks high, and half the jokes are not even funny😂
I dont know if i just have a bad humor or none of these are funny... at all
Why do people watch someone read out a joke then fake laugh
Do people think he's really laughing
The first one broo I- 😁😆😅😂🤣
Jesus Christ is coming soon     It isn’t too late to follow him
The bad thing is the toxic trait thing is my mom in a nutshell
Omfg FAX TO THE MAX
but my question is- who does he look at when he turns his head to the right while laughing????? yeah, think about that.
Is this shaggy?
I actually like this dudes energy, he seems like a good dude!
Is this arthur fleck from the hit movie joker (2019)
That laugh is so fake
"I like your personality , thanks it's a disorder" lmaooo I'm not forgetting that I want to slap people with my bpd
First one tho- 😂
These are so bad... it would be way funnier if you laughed at Facebook moms minions memes. THATS HOW BAD THESE ARE
Bro. Not to be mean. But 80% of the time it seems that you are forcing a laugh. Like, it’s not that funny.
The first one: lowkey depressing and worrying This guy: *nervous laughter*
*reads* 🤣 *pauses recording* 😒
Im dead these are so hilarious LMAOOOOOO😐😐😐😐
Is it only me who thinks tht his laugh is fake
The cleaning thing is 💯 my mood _every_ other day. 😂
Lol
“I like your personality” “Thanks it’s a disorder”  I felt that-
Bruh this guy needs to stop laughing at all of this shit, tf, the way he doesn’t even finish the meme before laughing makes the tweet not funny anymore... I cannot stand it to see this guy on my fyp -,-
The cleaning one is so very much me, I share a room and when I clean air yell at them for not helping but when they do they don't do it right
My life is like a iphone 12 The moment it hit the 13 it all went down
i just like his laugh.
Thease arnt really that funny-
This is fucking aids, why is it in my recommendations, that laugh bruh...
The last one is pretty accurate :3
*looks to the left to talk to someone*  Me: is there someone watching him do this or is he just weird
Bruh shitty joke we all know ur fake laughing u fucking peice of shit
Why does he do those fake laughs

I relate to that dog.
My favorite part of these videos is when you force the SAME exact laugh onto every shitty tweet you find
I have a doubt... whom do u look at every single time u read a tweet like is somebody always around you? I dont get it
My toxic is the cleaning part....
No one gonna talk about his f***ing overacting😂
The cleaning one is me 💯👏🤣
We have organizations like NASA who explore the solar system and we still can’t find the funny in these tweets.
No one:  This dude: FAX TO THE MAX
My toxic trait is attachment issues mixed with commitment issues
He laughes like a serial killer
The first one tho, so true🤣🤣🤣
The first on tho-  FACTS
The first one
When you ask for a snack and your friend says," My friend is hungry get him a snack!"🤣
The cleaning one is my mom with the dishes.
That's cleaning one is so me!!
HARRY POTTAH
Your laughter gives me life and purpose
Dude I am subscribing but if your memes level go down even a little you will lose a subscriber. So keep this great work on .
“My toxic trait is I won’t let you clean because it’s not clean unless I clean it, but then yell at you for not cleaning.”   Me: are you my mother?!
