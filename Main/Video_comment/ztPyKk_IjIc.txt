You r so lucky to get all of that stuff
Over Privileged kid! Priceless those tickets 🎟 I'm sure 😂 Yawn 🥱 😴 💤 🤷⚽️
First video I've seen Grealish stay on his feet in tbf.
GAY
i once took a photo with Olympic silver medalist miklos ungvari in my friend's phone ....and we once had a fight and he deleted that 😂😂😭😭
Got to love it when footballers do this for fans! They've been fans themselves and know exactly what it means too a fan
Made my day this video
Good
Brilliant 👍🏻
I'm surprised this kid know him. He is always on the bench
That kid is famous

Very luckkk💕💕me too jack grealish gave me his shirt
If that ball had a sign, it would be priceless once Grealish retires. Not like it's probably not expensive as of right now but you get what I mean
Calon Lord
His pops finna list that jawn on ebay
Should have chucked it back "WHERE'S THE AUTOGRAPH JACK MEANLISH"
I swear this kid gets loads of freebies
Was expecting a comment debating whether that was a good first ball or not you never know with the internet but the comments are nice 👏 respect for making the kids day
Great moment
Then a jobs worth steward probably took it off the kid.
Bro your spoiled for going matches, think of the money you have bro relax
What a save!
Although man’s hadn’t had a great season he’s great character 🙏
Here thinking he was gonna make that shit.  He didn't make it. I'm just furious
Sporley brat
He’s didn’t miss the first catch….. Grealish came up short lol
He is a flop for city. He can never fit in....
LUCKY
Imagine if jack could hit the target
Good man Jack 👏
how much is game ball?

I’d sell it
Very nice from Jack Grealish

If you're going to upload the video at least get the players name right instead of being disrespectful that was Jordan Henderson who kicked the ball to you not Jack Grealish.
Wow hahaha
Respect to Grealish and congratulations to the child who got the ball 😭😭😭👏👏
Just don’t take that to school bro 😂
Gsh

Dies, Jack Grealish viel spielen Er wird sein ein Protagonist aus England bei der WM 2022.
Lucky guy
Humildad
Great players do it at first chance
And another question..,, How do you react when you see well-known footballers? :)
Aha cool I actually have a question just so yes.,, but is you actually only quite aware that we all like what you do there😀😃?
Jack use his hand to throw the ball
Pemain ampas 😁😁😁

Glik destroying that nice man.
Proof Grealish js overrated

100% a steward came and asked the kid to give it back
He will gonna show this to his successor s🤣🤣
うらやま
G R E A L I S H     =     K U T A S
That's great 👍
You should say Thank you for that.
Jes
Stocks are crashing bitcoin investment right now will be at every wise individual's list. In three two months you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.
Good for him to get the ball kicked by the famous England player Jack Grealish.
It’s coming ROMEEEEEEE
Jack greaylish< GIGACHAD GLIK
Say thanks at least shessh
How definitley didnt get that ball out the stadium. "But Grealish gave it to me personally" " SUUUURRE he did kid"
It's all very cute but how about you teach that kid how to say "thanks"
He give u that ball, then guard take it back when u wanna go out... 😅
Imagine Ramos do that..
How does this kid get all these experiences with the players ?  is his dad a multi millionaire ? Does he work in the football industry? I want to know because it’s not normal 😂 it’s some childhood I will say that fair play to his parents
The overrated Grealish
Can you really take home the match ball? Here in my country it cost more than a bag full of rice and vegetables. We used to have one or two ball and no matter how far the ball is we would search and take it back during and after the match.
Nice one mate
Qwoeowo
Say Thank you British Boy 👦 😆
I got the 900th comment
Glik🇵🇱😏
This kid gets every thing he wants
That's the reason why l like him
If this was America the guy next to you would've stole it
Grealish = futur best player
I am jealous
I remember when Lasse Schone kicked one at me. Great memories!
Say what you want about Grealish, but he is an absolutely amazing role model for kids! Such a nice lad.
https://youtu.be/iwTurqgaYQc Tyson Fury Knocks out Deontay Wilder-Video🥊🔥
Ketamine
The way he got the ball close to the boy and passed the ball lightly to him is so nice!!!
Damn
Greatest childhood ever
Good catch too
All the players must find you a pain in the ass. They were all upset after the euro final and you were tryna get pictures with them 😂
Did he keep it?
Diver
Lol worth 100m and he had to use his hands cuz his first pass was short… embarrassing 😂
you ever heard of thank you?
He's overated he played one good match he's worth 54 million at best
Yo this kid is luckier than the man who survived 7 close to death accidents cheez man what a childhood
Can I have a shoutout
Strange as he gave him football boots aswell at England game, pretty sure family or friends
imagine being adult and remember this, im jealous
20 years later, this boy give the ball to some child by kicking.
100 million shot 😂
W kid
This kid have’s rich parents he can visit all games in vip places
damn bro how many players do you pay
That’s Rooneys son
That's about the only kick Grealish got against Liverpool!
Grealish can't even kick it over the bar lmao
There’s something very cool and endearing about Grealish. Not only is he a great pro who’s talented and gives his all but he’s absolutely amazing with kids and fans in general! Got the whole package and it’s great to see!
can you keep it?
This kid is so lucky
Nice pass
Great memory & Down to earth, my man! -KH
I once kicked a football back to some kids in a school yard .. I think we all have done a Grealish  🤣
The snake being nice 😍
Respect ✊
.
noob
100 milyon euro trash can
A me piace grealish non solo per il suo modo di giocare fenomenale ma anche per il suo FAIRPLAY GOOD JOB BOY
Bugl.mmyj.l
is that the same kid that got his shirt signed by jack?
Nice, bunch
he missed, so he had to throw it 😄
Not you the kid
I don't understand why every footballer he meet loves him so much
Congrats, bro🥶🤙
And the moment he gets out of the stadium boom the ball is been taken From him.
Well played Jack. Small gesture made a wee guys day.
Only if it was signed
Ooooo
It is doing little things like that, that mean the world to young fans, that they will remember forever.
how is he best friendfs with jack
did you manage to stay with the ball?
Class player would’ve used the laces.
A memory to always remember
Hi believe in god
Imagine if some jerk came and took it from the kid. Like the crappy lady in the baseball match
Respect grealish
Wow lol
Ah 100M right there.
That ball should be checked for COVID first! and then sanitized as well. ~ Concerned Canadian
Who is Jack Grealish?
Lucky man
This first attempt😭
this kid man
Im so glad thaz this kid is getting so many views, so wholesome.
Wow noice
Short pass
Hahaha he just missed on the first try. 100 million???doesn't worth 😂😂😂
How is this kid in every one of these videos, aren't there kids around?
Nice
2 days later the ball got stolen
Well done lad 👍🏼
100 mil into the drain
Proved, everyone deserves a second chance in life 🎀
You just paid for it lol
He went to my school
That happened to me with lingard but I was stuck way at the back of the stadium and he was shooting
Grealish is a traitor!!
That isn’t actually the match ball…
Luckyyy
Disliked I want it              Jk I liked
❤️❤️
100 mil my arse
Mshhlh
Remember this day once you realise life isn't what you thought it would be 🤣
Skillfull but no vision 😂
Lucky
This kid ain't even freaking out, give the ball to a kid who would be freaking out just to be allowed a football
Lucky
Bro this man is the most luckiest kid I’ve seen in football history.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCAIKRNhAHMVQ1tOV8uu651Q
So lucky
This guy is literally best friends with grelish
I'm so jealous 4 him
This youtube had a difference views and subscriber )”
OMFG its 2021 and some ppl still dont know how these football transfers work......Aston Villa got paid a 100 million for Jack Grealish.....this money is not Jack's.....his money comes from his wages n whatever endorsements and bonuses stop allyuh shit
This is true pain when u live in Africa and only go to uk on holidays and no team is playing especially favourite your favourite club can someone tell me what’s it like being in a real football game
Quality!
In germany we say " england ist scheiße aber trotzdem ehrenaktion"
Imagine the kid one day becomes a football star, and in an interview says he still has the football Jack Grealish gave him and it's in his huge mansion
Amazing man Grealish
legend
Football clubs after this kid uploads a video: *going bankrupt*
He will remember that day for the rest of his life.
Around 15 years ago I got a shirt from a player in an important game for my country and instantly sold it for 150 bucks to a random person 😂,
little posh white boy
did you managed to bring tht ball back home?
Can easily pass in first attempt
Too many of these highly paid players are so far removed from the fans today, that was a great thing by Grealish that gave the boy a memory of a lifetime.
So cool
https://youtu.be/NGDml23IKS4 এই মুভি আমাদের চ্যানেলে আগেই আপলোড হয়েছে
Hi super Olly t is that ball very soft to hit
Lucky u
You'll remember that day for the rest of your life 🙂
Gg it's Amazing
Rfhthgj
cool
And Harry Kane I think have him a thumb up
Harrryyyyyyy
this kid gets everything
He need to start putting them in the back of the net..100million pounds smh if he is worth it he needs to show it almost every game he gets subbed off around the 60+mins in the game
The only good pass he has made this season
Respect Jack made a young lads day, hats of to you
Snake
That was 100m worthy tekkers
Which i could get one from kdb it would be my dream
"To me" is to the cameraman, you meant "To him"
Poor pass

Nice one kiddo!
"Thank you!"  -Said no one ever.

Für immer Stürmisch!
need to know where those seats are
Wow this is brilliant!! I’m so happy for you lol that’s a childhood treasure 🔐
That tastes like poop
Missed first try.  Should be his slogan.
The Irish always had hearts
Thts 100 million worth of accuracy right there lol
Priceless, it's moments like that that give kids dreams of playing  for the favourite team. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Mo Salah is better than Grealish
Wow
100mln
Next Boom ... 💥 https://youtu.be/vZ-Dg0_oVR0 Out Now .. ♥🔥
Keep that ball man, don't use it, unless you're play it inside your house, but don't use it for playing with ur friends, it's too risky
in 5 years when grealish is the biggest name in football this will. be a legendary look back
Everyone knows what Jack is capable of grilling.
He will be a top player
Greatt
U are just perfect kid,other kids are just sweating in fortnite and bein mean to their parents
PODERIAM VER COMO EU JOGO NO IPHONE8 PRFV 🎮🔥❤️
Great player but your not worth 100 million
Worth 100mil and couldn’t even kick the ball to the kid the first time😂
A true 100mil player would of made that.
Love you Jackie Boy, miss you in the Villa. UTV
all i see is easy money
You can't  beat class
It’s coz you beg it from every footballer😂embarrassing
At least pretend to catch a ball dude
You are the luckiest kid ever
What a lucky kid
good job mate
A 100M player who can't even hit it over the bar😂😂🤣🤣
Nice
He’s so spoilt when it comes to getting stuff from footballers
Nice trophy
First time miss 🤦‍♂️
Luky one
Cherish that moment ❤️
Imagine if there no video no one would have believed him tho….
Nice
And just like that you have a £200 ball.
Ur Lucky Boy 😍❤
I don’t get it
Spoiled brat         This exact kid got a pic with messi along with a signed shirt this ball holds no value to him
That was so cool
desde que Grealish dejó de orinar en las calles Españolas su nivel ha ido en aumento
Memorable!   #GodblessNigeria
Awesome video!
next day a car destroys it playing on the street xD
Jack didn't kick at last He threw it with his hand I saw
Don't understand why people be hating on him just because he got a 100m move to city. Sure he might not be worth that price tag but he's still a genuine nice guy
100 millones y no pudo dársela con el pie
I’m tired of this kid he keep on having all these players shoes and jersey and match ball wtf
damn that man really missed. Bro you must be so happy I am happy just seeing this and I ain't even you bro.
This kid is always getting autographs and photos with the soccer players
A childhood dream 🙏
Who gives a shit
what a g
Say thank you don’t be rude
Kamil Glik was there? heh
Damn i feel jealous
Couldn't even kick it to him 😂 genuinely don't understand the hype around that clown, absolute joke.
Would've threw it back at his head the little diving shi**
I'll give him this he went to City and it didn't change him! GG Jack! 👏
Imagine Hakimi intercepted the ball. And said naw cuh.
Clickbait
Rubbish......this is how its done........watch Tim Cahill......  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPBZDzySXeg
Palmarès de GREALISH 🤣🤣
100m flop
This is the luckiest kid ever
Jack 'A thank you would've be nice'
Lucky to have met OllyT. Great job buddy, very jealous of everyone you’ve got to meet!
The woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years reached out through the crowd gathered around Jesus and touched his garment.  Instantly her bleeding stopped and she was healed.  “Jesus realized that power had gone out of him, turned to the crowd and asked, 'Who has touched my robe?'  His disciples replied, 'You see the crowd gathered around you, and you ask, Who has touched me?'  But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.”  (Mk 5:30-32).  She wanted to leave the place unnoticed, but Jesus felt power coming out of him and asked, "Who touched my robe?"       Didn't he know?  Of course he knew, just as God knew that Adam was hiding among the trees in the garden when he asked, "Where are you?"  (Gen 3:9).  This is what we call a rhetorical question, which is not intended to get an answer, but rather to stimulate a reaction or reflection.  And in the case of the woman, it had an effect: "Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, approached her, prostrated herself at her feet, and, trembling with fear, told her the whole truth."  (Mk 5:33).  The result of genuine faith is worship—“the woman... fell at her feet”—and also the confession and testimony of her faith.       But if the crowd gathered, why didn't anyone else benefit from leaning on Jesus?  Because the woman knew the seriousness of her condition and had faith that in Jesus she would find the solution.  Remember that before arriving there, she had already spent everything on doctors and medicine without solving her problem.  Faith and her awareness of her need go hand in hand when it comes to the salvation God offers.       If the woman had left unnoticed, any discomfort the next day would make her think she hadn't touched Jesus enough.  Hence the words: “Daughter, your faith has healed you!  Go in peace and be free from your suffering” (Mark 5:34).  The assurance of salvation is part of the whole work that God wants us to enjoy.  Millions of Christians live in uncertainty as to whether they are saved or not, thinking that it is up to them to persevere, as if the work of Christ had not been completed.  This is nothing but unbelief and trust in the flesh.  The apostle Paul wrote: “If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”  (Rom 10:9).  And Jesus said to Martha, "Did I not tell you that if you would believe, you would see the glory of God?"  (John 11:40).
Great to see juliette from bend like  beckham made it through
everyone love jacky, great player
Nice move 🙂 A "thank you" wouldn't hurt though 😉
Lucky just to get a 120 pound ball for free
So lucky you got the perfect place to sit
Just wondering, how much do seats like that cost?
It s coming ROME pagliacci
where is the thank you
That is awesome! Great class and style. Love that! ⚽⚽⚽💯
does he keep that ball?
Nice guy.
Crazy because when I was that age I would of jumped and dapped them both up.
Here before the million views
He loves you mate ☺️
Brat.
Was it the same kid who asked Pep to pass him a letter?
What A 100 million player worthy!!😂😂😂
This is Soooo Cool
........VERY COOL............⚽️👌✨✨✨
Did he miss the catch or did it not reach him?
Didnt he get the boots too
Stockx taking notes that will be 50k
Iys not grealish his football so he dont care😂😂😂
100 million flop
He’s over rated hasn’t done nothing for city yet
I fucken hate city and everything they stand 4. But I can't lie Grelish is a fucking good dude!
Best thing he's done all season...
💪💪
100 mio pounds pass lol
jack grealish is an amazing and wholsome footballer
Even as a united fan I have so much respect for him making that kids year
We know very well that grealish has a cruel character, but with this gesture he impressed me
Lucky you
After all the diving he has done, i can now forgive him
That missed kick pretty much sums up his season
Idhar phekta tb maar honjata ball lene ke lie
He is much much better than lukakku
£100m and he couldn't even kick it to the kid 😂
What goals he scored fucking shit
What a legend
Just seconds after that ten stewards flew onto him trying to take the ball away
As a defensive tactic, a larger kangaroo will often lead its pursuer into water where, standing submerged to the chest, the kangaroo will attempt to drown the attacker under water.
Legend has it that boy switched over to tennis a year later
I hope you got to keep the ball
Why always him
Это роман Зобнин
Clearly they're warming up, not a match ball, Jack has one f**k all and pretty sure that ball isn't Jacks to give away! Once in a lifetime....pah! 🤣
What a legend!
Jack grealish very humble and very kind
100 millions footballer can’t pass the ball he has to use his hands to pass it😩
😍
The most overrated player, the new Beckham, Wilshere, Rashford, the list goes on and on. And they all seem to have one thing in common 😂
Hay algo que este joven no haga bien?
Greelich
I’m a big Celtic fan when I was your age I heard Celtic where training at w local pitch. I ran down there and kicked my ball over the fence and got Henric Larson to kick it back to me. I still have it know and I’m 29 😂
thanks to you for your support, and admiration for the national claw, good day
So Grealish is handsome AND nice??
You better keep that ball in your locker or else I’ll come.
🤩
Toplad is our jack let's be honest.. all the best to him
Didn't even say thank you though
Imagine if he just smashed it😂😂😂😂
Awesome 💯💯💯
Narrrr I'm jealous 😂😫
oo wow lucky 🍀 🍀
Lol the luck (i think it will stay with him for a long time)
Imagine official asking him the ball back!!!
Nice guy. Only takes a second to give someone a moment of joy
100 milyarlık adam daha topu yukarı atamıyor hığaminaa
Congratulations lad 👍
⚡
Luckiest person
This kid gets about.
Is that need to post a video to show us that !???
That will go a long for that young lad. Some footballers literally don’t understand the power and they hold over some people . Brilliant well done jack
Daddy’s money
100M, but he can't make that pass
110€ ball
Ok lets not ignore how smooth his catch was
Is this the kid that got his boots?
114 Mio bezahlt und er braucht zwei Versuche ( mit Humor nehmen)
Nice
Nice mate, happy for ya
I’m super jealous
As a Villa fan I can tell you this is what Grealish has been like throughout his career. Always went out of his way at the end of a match to give his shirt to a kid in the stands.   I hate the fact he gets abused by our fans now
Jack is not a £100 million player
100m player. Can't even pass first time 🤣🤣
He tired🤣
Waw you see KANE GREALISH 🙂💔You feel my pain🥺🥺😭🥺😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😭🥺
I feel like this shorts is once going to be in the 100m+ lists ITS 100K now
O bixo é tão merda que erra o chute pqp.
0:05 Ha he missed.
Lol that grin after he missed at the end
Personally I would’ve asked for his headband
Honestly, id keep the ball for your life without playing with it. Its literally a once in a lifetime opportunity. Priceless.
Imagine the pain missing the first catch and Grealish not giving him a second chance 😂😂
how much to buy it?
Even here he couldn’t properly kick it the first time 😂😂😂
100 million waste😂😂😂😂😂
Dont know how kind he is but a 100m$ false to pass the ball in the first one lmao
.
Incredible bro
Guys he didn't put 100m price tag on himself..
Rich people seat
Can you own the match ball??
I see 100m walking
100 mil and he can’t even place the ball high enough so that the kid grab  it 🤣🤣    Who ever want to tackle me for saying , ur boy is way overrated and doesn’t even deserve to be payed half of what he has cost ,,,deal with it 😉🤣🤣
Lucky guy
100 million to throw the ball
So nonchalantly
W
I hope the kids plays with the ball and doesnt place it in a shelf to show off.
Dislike for a player is understandable but hate is not acceptable. Some fans are too busy hating on Grealish. He owes nothing to anybody.
Why did this make me smile
Nice
About Grealish being a 100M player, look, as of today, I honestly think that is very overpriced for what he is currently delivering. But in my opinion, it is just a matter of time. Guardiola knows his shit and for sure wouldn't spent 100M for nothing, so I think everything is going as planned.  But that's just my opinion.
get in there lad!
Never lose that ball
I'm just remind he cost 100 million €
definition of  "happiness is simple"

What a spoilt kid 😂 Lucky him.
Kudos.to.u.for.keeping.ur.calm,super.olly!
Nice 👍
they're not allowed to keep the ball no?
Fun fact: he threw the ball with hands
Super dope from Grealish!
That’s so sweet
Guys gonna be an expensive flop
Keep that thing in a safe 😂
Plastic ball
That's super cool!
so cute
so amazing to have the possibility of getting the match ball from an European Champion! I like his personality, kicking the last winning penalty against Italy was superb
Let's stop talking about how he's a 100m player, trust me he's just getting started
Jesus Loves you
What if he missed the second time😂
:0 Wow 💖
I swear grealish has a crush on this guy
Lol does he gets to keep the ball?
I have always wondered how hard those balls are
Say thanks then. Ungrateful little shit.
the smile on the kids face makes this 100x better
Tell him next time to learn how to play and not do the same move over an over again. He gonna keep getting pocketed🤣🤣🤣
100 million pounds and he can't even kick it up to him first time????
Great childhood memory.
Why does this kid get everything tho like smh
Sums up his footballing ability 🤡
I thought you're not allowed to take the official ball back home.
Did you keep it?
Nice bro
oh wow a man kicked a football at me.   Jesus man, so f*cking bent
lmao fail
100 million and can’t kick a ball properly. 😂😂😂 what a joke. What a tossed.
you should put that ball behind glass together with the clip of how you received it it will be worth money in the future and will have lot of sentimental value (depending of grealish's career)
jackpot bro
100 million pound FOOTballer and he needs to throw the ball to you, well done lad keep the ball safe if you still have it ;)
Its so awkward when you have to throw it back though
Should be getting it to him first time for 100mil😅
Keep that ball in a case or something safe and dont let it lost or scratched👌🏻
Better Than my idol pessi 🤡💩
So lucky
Aw
Imagine if he wouldn't catch it from the second time
Is that boy took that ball to home.....😜😜
That’s awesome!!! Good for you!!!
Nice act from Grealish that 👌🏼
Messi and Ronaldo better
So glad you get to…. GIMME ITS MINE I HAD IT FIRST!
that ball is mine
He missed the first attempt lol Edit: lmao bruh I just stated a fact in this comment, the reply section is full of toxic jerks
Wow!SO COOL
