I cant figure out what's more pathetic; the video or the song?       LAME AF !!!  especially for trying so hard to jump on the "devil" trend in Hollywood.

I’m here after Ginny and Georgia

I came here summoned by The Devil herself 😈
If you brought yourself here because you’ve been her fan from the start 🤘🏻❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Ginny and Georgia brought me here🔥
THIS BEING GINNY GEORGIA, SO GOOD LISTEN TO ALL BANKS SONGS YALL
who is here from Ginny & Georgia <3 perfect fit
Es que en la serie sonaba tan oscuro que tenía que buscarlo❤
Here from Ginny and Georgia,
Side note 📝 I forgot all about banks😮

Anyone here from GINNY AND GEORGIA ?????
Who’s here after Ginny and Georgia ✌️
I love this song so much before Ginny and Georgia so glad it’s in season three.
I'm also Satan 666$!-

I will require a slightly larger box. And a hole for beers. And a batting cage if possible. Get it? "Batting" cage. Cuz like bats and whatnot. #djEjackula2026 BLAH!
Banks is a good dancer
This how i imagine all them freak off diddy parties went
0:13 Julian Casablancas is that you?
This is my favorite song by BANKS 🔥
common    thats so cool
Someone write my new  name down
Alexia. Angel o demonio ❤ Would be a powerful edit.
Mmm mmm mmm❤ sweet video! 😘💋
this song is SO HAUNTING AND EPIC
ASMR has never been sexier than with those backing vocals.
One of my favorite songs of all time!
I am the Devil. You are Blessed. Let everyone know the Devil has Returned
This video is so demonic and she is not hiding it either, that she is serving Satan with her music and she is misleading her fans and listeners of her music to a burning end.
This is such a sacred demonic tune
Why all these videos are so satanic ??????
Now i remember doing that 😅
1:58 omg the way BANKS is puppeteering her dancers in this- amazing!
this was haunting, most fun experience
🥀🕷🕷🕷🪱👍😈🙂🥰🖤🌙🖤❤️🦂💃☠️
Best compliment of all time, after intimacy with a girl, she dead serious asked me if I was the devil. And idk, don’t think so
WTF how high wet the writer and producer of this video 😢
THIS IS SO HOT AAAAAAAAHHH BANKS GIRL WHAT IS THISSS
SHE DOES NOT MISS
This is complete garbage. This is all old, old old!! Do something new artisits!! The old devil bit is trash, and the music is mind numbingly bad. Anyone in the comments applauding this, must b a yout. No one with any culture would enjoy this garbage. So generic. Ugh. 3 minutes I'll never get back.
👠 That Red dress 🪭    💄
Is she single as of June 28 2024? I'm a fallen angel
منو اجت من شام رواية ازاريا ايفيريا 🥸🤏
she sold her soul too???
God i wish that were me.
That was hot.
2024❤
NOOOOOOO WHY IS SHE SAYING SHE'S THE DEVIL?! BANKS IS TALENTED WHY IS SHE DOING THIS DEMONIC SONG AND VIDEO?!!👎👎👎👎👎
screen melter 🔥 well done
💥💥💥❤️‍🔥💥💥💥
The devil is a moron.  Your video is foolish
Amen
@banks are you influenced by  Fiona Apple  at all? She has been one of my favorite writers/artists my entire life. she is easily my favorite female song writer, youre not too far behind her! ❤ lol but if you know Fiona, then you know why.  To those of you who dont know her music, you should listen to "fast as you can" "criminal" "paper bag" and "sleep to dream" shes got so many more good songs but these are just some of the popular ones. She wrote "criminal" and "sleep to dream" at 18 years old
Someone write my new name down 🔥❤️‍🔥😈
What were they thinking with this music video 😅
Les Satanists envahissent tout, c'est à gerber 🤮🤮🤮
I am not a duck in foryutofuckoff
I love u banks 💗
ммм хуета
cool
I love u banks🙏🏾🌹u cute 🥰 I’m suffocating I love me so much.
It is not something you want to be apart of hell is no joke YOU CAN BE SAVED THROUGH JESUS CHRIST HE DIED ON THE CROSS FOR YOU JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN
Not the Devil
Jesus is the way
Seductive video. Creative writing
If you have 4K image quality, that would be great. I support you
Devil music is much better them all the music
The best thing Iz the video screw your audio
Yes the Bible tells u who the devil iz
Yes the Bible tells u who the devil iz
The Bible tells u who the devil dummies😮
It is amazing less than 2 billion are banked today.  Wait till 8 billion are their own bank.
Very nice sweetheart 😘
Ashnikko would’ve sounded awesome on a remix of this!! 😮
highly offensive. see tarot. 6. -3
Hail Seitan!
Look at Doja cat. Can't even deal with the tearing and ripping at her soul right now trying to portray this exact disgrace. You think going to these shows watching the work of illuminati puppets is cool but these artist probably want to kill themselves.  Would you be okay if these artist started taking things further and doing it on stage for everyone to see?  I think it's time for a nice reality check.
1.7 million views for garbage lol
#banks I came out of a 10-year abusive relationship when my friend Tasha introduced me to Banks. The first song was Weaker Girl. And after that I've been in love with  her music and her artistry ever since. And I keep missing your tours but one day I'm going to catch you rolling through Indianapolis.
Your music make me so powerful and healing my soul.❤❤❤
you are the godd
The devil is where your lost wondering  where love lays world despair where the heart of gold!!!
As a Christian,I Kinda Like the Beat but I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE LYRICS & TITLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Slayed ❤❤❤❤
Iconic
This is the dumbest I couldn't even watch the whole thing
The fact that doja like literally copied your whole vibe here pisses me off 👿
I just like the melody ❤
Rabbi a’oothu bika min hamazaatish-shayaateni Wa-a’oothu bika rabbi am yahdoorun. (Meaning in English: “ O my Lord! I seek refugee in Thee from the Evil suggestions of the Satans and i seek refugee in Thee, O my Lord, lest they come near unto me “  Amin 🤲🕋
🤔👁️🤮
I own some Banks including bank of America.
Being sacrificed by hot girls in a satanic ritual is truly date goals to me
Don’t like that much first, big mistake
one of the best song ever. so much love
Nothing new. The devil snuck in under a lie and now he's destroying everything in his path. It's who he is. It's what he does. He hides under your bloody secret.
Tr*sh
Looks like a satanic ritual and worship, not appealing at all. And wtf was the ending ?? Why are people eating this shit up , totally clueless like honestly. Disappointed in Banks for succumbing to this fuckery
Look at my baby fockin up those dance moves.....I love every album I play altar the most due to a relationship, I was in at the time.  Goddess played every hour while I was hospitalized for two months.  I remember saying Banks and the weeknd should do a concert and my nurse said they did I went it was awesome 😂.   Damn to my health challenges for making me miss out.  I have CLL and a rare blood disorder.  Im determined to see Banks perform my daughter's and I love her so much.
I love this it reminds me of my lilith that i miss so much.
Sat4nic.
Oh zhe went Britney eazy im digging it is this a shiut iut to brjtney?
Gommie that dark 808 layered on that moog funkyness
WOMAN, I have been a fan for so many years & for so many reasons. BUT THIS  NEXT GALAXY
God is coming soon its not to late to repent
Took micheal Jackson dance move
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I have this song on a list and it comes right after Donnie McClurkin Stand!!😳😆 Mmmm, my aunt and cousin are most definitely fuming  in they grave!!😇😇
Why the auto-tune tho 😢
Сама туда залазь)
You fooled me so many times. No this one. Never anymore
This B worshiping the devils, what a joke.. 🤡
Thanks my sraalker I have everything for free
Танцював у червоних боксерках під цій хіт)
she is so different than years ago.  her style is getting more and more commercial each day. i only miss the first album and still listen to it a lot still. her listeners changed too. i guess i havent checked her stuff for a few years kinda lost my interest since the new songs were not my style.

Omg!!! I love it!Perfect video with perfect music!!!I
Okay!!
How do I not know about her
In love not obsessed
I love her!
I wanna see her and kacey musgraves do a crossroads performance.
Ayy
Banks continues to evolve. She's in a LEAGUE OF HER OWN.
This direction is amazing, remember the Jonas Âkerlund directions
Stolen from Maruvs sad song
What are some other bangers by her, I like this
That Car is a McLaren Senna btw. Banks is certainly Lady of Culture . M'Lady 😁🥰

Love you, BANKS! Much love from the Philippines 🇵🇭
The snake  The rat The cat  The dog How you gonna see em  If you're living in the fog
The soul that she gives to her performances is beyond phenomenal. Same with her whole crew and everyone involved in making masterpieces like this.
Another fantastic song and video, awesome!
First time I heard of Banks she came with a Travis Scott for a Weeknd concert in Newark, NJ…I been on sis heels ever since!
This song is terrible :/ cool video tho
Imagine a collab with BANKS and Charli XCX omg <3
Im so in love with this song
😎😎😎
Че за испанский стыд
This gives Janet Jackson vibes
This song is honestly deserves a better music video. This MV has its moments, but just doesn’t connect in the same way as the song alone does.
I can't wait to tour with lauren jauregui
WoW! Nice! You are The Best!
Scary haha
La canción me gusto y el video me dio algo de miedo ...pelicula de terror LOL
https://youtu.be/PXpsVUkMnZs
i love the last frame where she spit on me
What´s she trying to do with her new stuff? This sounds like something Charli XCX threw by the toilet. Jesus chist most the of her new singles are just TERRIBLE.
This the most dumb ass video!! Who shot this? Some high school kid from the valley?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Disappointed. I want the old Banks Back, give her back reptilians.
How did i miss this??? wow I'm late. lol the video so cute! ❤🔥😂 love this!
Everybody's got at least a little evil inside, right? Good work Banks.
also, why would the guy freely get into the box?
I've always thought BANKS was pretty, but she's downright sexy in this.
Is this inspired by bedazzled at all?
Thinking out loud here… the Adam & Eve & Snake metaphor is real… imagine the album title being “Serpent” or something… maybe something to do with shedding snakeskin… or even “original sin”

Brothers and sisters, the exact time of the Second Coming is known only to the Father (see Matthew. 24:36). There are, however, signs that scriptural prophecy relating to that tumultuous day is being fulfilled. Jesus cautioned several times that prior to His Second Coming, “many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many” (Matthew. 24:11).
More satanic shit coming out of the music industry
this video made me a bottom
Lol
Lol. Be Me"?

scary movie   1 2  3 4 5 6?
her STANCE OMFGGGG!
Banks is meant to rule ❤️‍🔥
She looks like millions of white girls unfortunalty she went through life and had to see this anyone who society doesn’t want should be dead lol she’s literally one of millions of white girls she doesn’t get enough attention to have a clear mind lol she’s probably delusional so she wouldn’t understand but yes
The choreography is everything
Had to not get w song on someone else ? Ian ain't normal
Did you need to copy banks ?
Jacinda Ardern way down we go !
Well Lucifer was in charge of the music, but be careful playing with fire, eventually you'll get burn.
Why so much Sex in the Video. Your music is the point. Don't let you tell crap from a Manager or something like one of these idiots.
If you don’t mind dying over and over again this is what the dark side promises rebirth but death
Uh OH! Wtf
Video is wack ....song is good tho
Everybody wants to keep speaking demons into existence then drop to their knees begging God to save them once they’re licking your forehead & consuming your spirit. 😂 #goodluck
wow cool i liked the clip congratulations
Mark 16:9 “Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.”  King James Version (KJV)
i don't get why the sound sounds like it was recorded with a cassette recorder
Is that the car from Starboy?
يا هلاااااا
BTW the car scene was real, Banks really can do that.
We missed uuuuu
I don't know what it says about me, but I really like this song/music video. Hehe. 🙂
I want to see her in concert
This video gives me Britney Spears vibes 😃
every time i listen this song I feel like ending up in a pole dance lmao
chemtrails print
i love it.
So many references to BDSM. From the suitcase to the fits and, omg, that ending spit. I love that so much, really. Is the Devil a true living Goddess and strict dominant queen. I guess so lol. Thank you for that sweet clip and for assuming who you really are, Madame Banks 🙏🏼
gotta catch em all
When is your album release?
ITS PERFECT!!!
This song is like half of me haha
Really enjoy Banks music but this one....we're full up on our Luciferian powers in our world right now. I'll pass on this one.
Inspiring, tbh.
I like the song but this video is just trying way too hard 😩
In the end, even the eldest Son returns to the One.
I wanna be damned
😀
queeen 🙏🏽 ugh i love banks so much 😭💖
Well im turn on😁😁😁🥳🥳🥳😎😎😎love the dancing
FREAKING LOVE THE NEW SONG! LOVE BANKS ALWAYS! Your music heals my soul.
Hahahaha Banks been killin it
imagine a collab with upsahl
So shes singing about the devil now?  ME: CROSSES FINGERS AND HOPES THIS DOESN'T MEAN SHES GOING MAINSTREAM (I like that banks is like a dirty little secret just for her fans and mo one else knows about her) Shes better than most of the "pop singers" out there today.i havent listened to radio or kept up with the charts in at least 15 years because it's all crap lol
This is my favourite song!!! And the beginning, OMG !!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Why she never on radio she's amazing
I thought her willing victim looked familiar, like Orphelia's hookup Miles from Sweet/Vicious. Anyone know who the actor is?
So happy a strong woman occupies the space of pop. Yeyy, go Banks.
I love how you structure your song Right around The beat it really always make sure you come up with something special
You are amazing
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
god i love when women
thank you so fucking much for this i feel so powerful
I love this song and your album Altar. It feels like you're hearing my life and making it into music. Thankyou for helping us stand up for ourselves.
If you’re the devil Ig I’m a Satanist now.

Hi Eminem, do you mind if I take the beat from Godzilla from you?

this sounds incredible you’re so talented DONT EVER STOP PLEASE
Tha mouthwash and cigarette were delectable sir. No fone no hoeblems
o TANTO que eu amo essa demônia...
NOBODY:  The devil: I'm so fancy You already know I'm in the fast lane From L.A. to Tokyo
I love how the dancing scenes have a switch back and forth from locations. It’s just incredible. I have no words to describe your genius🙃 love you forever
I like how the guy was scared at first then 3 girls in see-through white dresses came along and he was like "sheeeet ok I'm down".
Anybody know Who the male model in the video is?
I miss the old banks. Voices that cut my soul deeply. Voices that leads me to a deep deep deepest dark mind everyone could have. I miss the pain, i miss the funerability, but hell yeah first album always every artist's best album.
Amazing job!!!
Favourite part…the spit at the end! Says so much me some how. Loving your work 👊🏻
Teu puguh ah
🔥🔥
I like you Banks, but this song just felt messy.
Come to Vancouver BC aaahhh
Video has unforgivably few views.
first time hearing you...awesome song!
This is amazing! I love that you're trying to interact with your fans too. Stay Safe and amazing.
THIS IS MY ANTHEM SORRY EVERYONE NOT READY FOR ME WHEN THIS PLAYS

Also the video is good
I like the lyrics only😉
Not a fan it this song. But the video is sexy like always. Still love ya.
Where can I have a test drive on that car
Good artist but the song is “eh” for myself
Banks is the Devil, now l'm a Satanist.

I'm always told that I taste sweet from all the coffee an sugar I drink..
BANKS girllllll. Been here since the early days, the sad boy days, the Bedroom Wall days. Always such an inspiration, you own your sound. you're in a rare league with acts like The 1975 where no one can hold a candle to em. BANKS is BANKS. she will always come as ill as can be & that's that. only a fool would expect anything less, she's had her foot on peoples necks & they don't even know it yet ❤️🖤
QVEEN HERB & BANKS?! OK? lesssss gooooooo

WE HAVE OFFICIALLY HIT 1 MILLION VIEWS, TRIBE 🔥🔥🔥
This video is so stupid.
You are an amazing artist! But.. there's so many other many layers that could have been added! Quadruple platinum status.. btw was waiting on the Weeknd's part..or Quavo.. 🤔
Honey stfu
Just came from Spotify after adding this to my “sensually kills you” playlist. Seems like I had the right visuals in mind because that’s basically the mv
I love this video so much 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
BANKS! Girl, bravo!! Your evolution is 🔥I am a big fan for many years past and many to come. Story related to you: I am an intuitive. I was compelled to create a playlist called my jailer my releasor. I added songs that caught me within the firs 3 seconds of listening and added it to the playlist. A month later I was in a car talking to my partner and a strong need to ask this person if he was aware an entity was trying to communicate. He changed the subject many times but the urge to persist was strong. Finally I asked if he would give me permission to communicate with the presense and he said yes. As I started the reading he changed his mind right as I asked for the entity to give its name. I stopped. I turned my attention to my phone that was connected to the cars radio and gasped when I saw your Poltergeist song was playing!! Chills! We listened and read the lyrics. Quite the perfect synchronicity. I further communicated and released the presence. Improved the ambiance. Gratitude for all you channel into this universe.
🥺
The highfalutin address complementarily delay because pail revealingly melt to a large slave. puny, awesome roadway
Why is this masterpiece so short!? Should have been 10 times longer!
would you ever consider releasing like, a dance performance video of this? I absolutely loooove the dance segments of the video.
this video work is so MARUV - To Be Mine + Don't stop, BANKS looks stunning though
I think I just became a satanist 🖤😍😍😍
Looks like Banks is back and might made a deal with the Devil 😈 Sign here on the dotted line............. With your Blood❣ Have a  👺Chance to Dance with the devil👹 🎉🏦🥳🥵😈👹👺🥳🏦🎉 2021👻

How is this clip not even 1M? This is literally pop perfection
Anybody else recognize the guy in the car from 13 reasons why!!
I used to like you until I seen this. I can't even listen to it. Sure God is thrilled. Speaking from a prophets mouth. Absolutely disgraceful. The enemy is cunning and entirely evil. I feel bad for your soul. Dream of Jesus. Dream of the enemy. Dream of us all in line. Dream of white horse. Dream of burning bush and burning tree. Dream of opening in the clouds when no one was listening. 3rd horse. Can not wait for the fourth one! Judgement day is coming sooner than you all think. Can't say you were not warned. See you have the chance to redeem yourself after selling your soul. Yet celebs want to make an idol of themselves. Worship someone who didn't create them. Sad.
Slightly cringe in some moments xD
He’s hot🤪
Thank you for reminding us "Will I AM - feeling my self"
KKKKKKKK Que diabo é isso ?????
Thank GOD for you ☺️🙏🙏🙏😊🙏😊😊
Those red boots are smoking hot and on you well kind of like putting fusible materials inside the core of a well structured fission device. The choreography in this is comparable to the same with surprisingly powerfully disarming effect on my ability to resist any rottweiler like hand gestures you might want to direct me around with on a whim... just saying you had my immediate undivided attention from time 0:00...💕 it
Brenda G. Gomez
ok but I get ASMR from this song
Violet Dyck Van Banks
One Chance
WTF is this sh it hahahahahahahahaha
Song masterpiece!😍😍
Jezebel.
Everyone suffers from sleeplessness at some point in their life.  There's just so much going on nowadays, so many problems in the world and it's so overwhelming. You end up lying awake at night dreading falling asleep because then you'll wake up and have to face the world again At the same time, I often find myself staying up late because I feel like that's the only time that I have to myself, to carve out a little peace in the day. This mix is for those moments in the night. To escape your worries for a little while and just drift away with the music.
I'm speechless. This is such a powerful song fueled with your hypnotic voice. It's a hymn to self-confidence and an ode to feminity. Thank you so much for this, Banks!
I’m going through this mentally right now! Embracing the dark to be stronger than my demons. I was scared of the dark for a long time but it’s starting to feel good. People will see this and think she sold out but they’re just programmed. The ones that get it, get it. I, too, assumed all these celebs sold out but I finally understand the deeper meanings of their work.   Now… some people are def sell outs for other reasons but seeing a Devil image doesn’t automatically mean they’re literally worshipping Satan lmao the goal within is to embrace the duality.   Is the Devil really so bad if he’s the one punishing those who commit terrible offenses? What is good? What is bad? If a man murdered someone in cold blood, is he bad? What if he murdered someone who was a child rapist? Does that now make him good? These are the questions to ask. God and the Devil are two sides of the same coin.
Me encanta esta canción     .    .    .
i  Guay   !
Go back to the hell! Isus son of God 🙏
aint this winston from 13rw!!
How is she doing this lmao
OUSADA ❤️😈
1 and 40 seconds of my life I'll never get back
The ending was great I thought  they were going to eat him  that need to be another  video
fire women  been waiting  for video  and song like this  that make women  more powerful then anything  every woman  wants what they want  and respect  . Fire it's about time  2021
now this is devilicious
Idk but this song just made it on the Halloween Playlist for life
stupid techno-like "music" covered with nudity. This is shame not music
Good job. I dig the music.
La parte de las chicas vestidas de blanco bailando me recordó a Chemtrails over to the country club de lana del rey! Te amo Jillian Banks 😻
Nossa eu achei uma vibe meio Suspiria no começo. Ameyyy!!!!
Вот так, парни. Надо с женщинами на трезвую голову знакомиться. А то не успеешь оглянуться, сидишь уже в какой то коробке, а вокруг тебя три бабы страшные в стремных ночнушках бегают. Предположительно жена, теща и свояченица. И плевать они хотели, что тебе на рыбалку надо, тащут в клубешник.
I NEED YOU JOIN AND WORK FOR ME FHINSING UNAG PESANGON GOLDEN SECOND
BANKS back at it with the Heat. 🔥🔥🔥
notice how she only k!lls men 👀 very sexy🥵🥵
Que coisa mais horrorosa deu até medo sangue de cristo tem poder
I need this song in the new season of Lucifer!
Certified im the nice one. BANKS 💕🎊👍👏
if banks decided to lock me in a clear box i would simply thank her for it. rip to that guy but i'm different
This would have been perfect for when Sabrina found out she is a Morningstar, specifically that church scene where she saves everyone from the missionaries and levitates
Am here only for Deaken 💔
How much Devil you want to be in your new video? Banks - Yes!
nop
никому Марув не напоминает?
stupid corporate manufactured crap for pinheads
Found ur rogue Louie targeting my girls cars
Check his garage and attic wiring. Is in his attic small crevice towards front of building on right when facing front of house
LOVE U SO MUCH! Regards from Argentina, in the end of the world!
ISSO NAO PODE FLOPAARRR
😍
Drake the motion sample?
Irgendwie mehr Porno als Musik Video. Aber irgendwie hat es was ;)
.
I love you Banks but there is so much devil things in your lyrics and videos. It seems a coincidence that most Jewish artists have a huge emphasis on making their videos with diabolic themes. I don't think you have a contract with iluminatis otherwise you would have millions of views...  Anyway, I love you but I know who you are, where you come from ethnically and who you work for.
Idk what I just watched but sis I’m living 🔥
What’s with the devil obsession in the music industry? Subliminal messaging!
I opened YouTube mobile and was fed to this paid view campaign?
666k viewers as I commented on this!!! She's communicating!
девки, выпустите пацана из ящика!
in the box 📦
Lucifer: 💳💥💳💥💳
É ELA!!! 🛐
niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
The rambunctious shorts radiologically plan because file simplistically complain unlike a  five shingle. lyrical, smooth close
OMFG!
Please, made collaboration with Anna Calvi omg ;)!
Anyone catch on to why&how she exists in the world??? Her name is:BANKS  she is the representation of all the banks that ever existed in the existence of humanity from the beginning of time all the way to the end.. Notice the amount of people subscribed to BANKS is it not accurate to how likable all of humanity likes all banks that ever had & ever will exist. Now look no further at the lyrics to her songs & the videos. She’s been put her as a test from Jesus Christ, The Son Of God to see if people are aware of how accurate she is to have how humanity feels & likes BANKS. The lyrics in this song are on spot to what I’ve had brought to my attention by Gabriel the Angel from the Bible,/&OR/,Holy Bible.. he pointed out visually & overall how accurate she represents All the BANKS that will ever exist. The song begging for thread is pretty obvious “so I got inches that scratch” that’s banks &money lolz! This song is pretty good because it’s revealing how spiritual wickedness in high places is real. where are they going to be…BANKS of course. & the devil. Oh & also songs I’ve listened to by BANKS all have very revealing beats.. they’re all good which all comes from talented musical artists/beings:Lucifer, The devil, evil, money. Easy to notice once awareness is there. & I really enjoy observing this &the catchy beats from BANKS backs up everything i brought into awareness about by Jesus Christ, The Son Of God this song is dope & I like the general artistic revealing I come across in BANKS. Jesus I’m impressed lolz
So glad you're back 🌹🖤
THIS IS FIRE!!!!!!!!!
The worlds ending period pooh
👹 Might Satan be lurking at your chamber door? 👹
Satanic much
❤️‍🔥
The Devil puts bad men in a boxes. Love it!
BANKS is taking it there
Gotta agree with several others, the Directors Cut version of this video(also on BANKS' channel) is even BETTER! And i'm really surprised that isnt the "official" video  Good to see more BANKS music <3
Try hard
someone has been watching lucifer to much lol loved it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0DqRstCgj4 sounds similar
Why do I feel terrified and loved and the same time
Put this video on Syfy
ATE AND LEFT NO CRUMBS
Not too fond of the concept but it's gonna take an awful lot for me to desert banks as my overall favourite artist! And this song has just made a new fan of my gf so I stan! 😅
I've been obsessed with BANKS's music before she even released her first album. to me this music video just feels and looks outdated and unoriginal. im still hyped for the new album though <3
My favorite parts in the music vedio  is when she stepped out  from the car  with that red dress.She look hot! And that part when she up in the air while the car still moving.Epic!!!
ive got a one way ticket and the devil waiting
Tell me all your favorite parts!
🔥🔥🔥
This is ASMR song
Not her best. Cheez whiz alert.
okay so asmr music isnt me, confirmed xD
Women are so damn beautiful.
Drive me 😋
You people that stupid, she doesn't write her own music. Please. She's a puppet, might as well have a wind up lever in her back.
I still dont gest why shes soooo underrated… tunes, creation, lyrics, its amazing… im fan since 1st single and Banks never disappoints me… whats more I always find strength and understanding in her words ❤️ keep on going Banks u r amazing ❤️
Happy Wonderful a Present Good BANKS a Universal Nice To Love You a The Devil💃
.... is that Winston from 13 Reasons Why lol
Devil wears DILARA
why is this giving me 2000s vibes?
Бредятина
in this video shes look like "Blair of Gossip Girl"
These interesting smaller artists deserve more attention like banks, rina sawayama etc Please suggest more below
Just on time. Devil vibes are appropriate right about now. 😈
🔥🔥🔥
Anyone else notice that the guys "gasp" voice clip is the same as when James Bond gets hit in Goldeneye for the N64? LOL
𝙄 𝙡𝙤𝙫𝙚 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙫𝙞𝙙𝙚𝙤 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙢𝙮 𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙡.♡︎☺︎︎
Oh Babe. That’s better than Better one…. 😹😌🥀
Good music
Thanks baby
here from love island lmao now I'm addicted this is so good
She’s literally my god 🤣
Damn so good girl
Believe in Jesus, we are all sinners deserving the wrath of God, because we sin against a holy and perfect God. Therefore we all deserve the punishment hell, but God in his rich grace and mercy by which he loved us, sent Jesus to die for us on the cross to  leave his throne and suffer for us, to be the perfect sacrifice for us.. because he himself was sinless and perfect. That if we would have a repentant heart and believe in Jesus and place our faith in him, we will be saved from the eternal punishment which is hell, and be given eternal life. God loves you!
0:52 me when I hit the traffic jam!!
Where do I know that baseline from?
Looks like a Brammstrokers Dracula to me..
Is it a half life sin like me?
Found this from love island
How is she so flexible??? It's insane.
Gave me ZOLITA vibes but... better? Conclusion: AMAZING.
yKNOW WHAT? AFTER THAT LAST SHOT, I GET IT NOW.
trash satanic noise 🗑
God I love her music
Isn’t that Winston from 13 Reasons Why? Lmfaoo. 😂😂😂
So DELICIOUS🥰
I'm a bit disturbed by this one.
BANKS be over here blessing the gays again
If going to hell means going to that car with her, I’M IN.
Queen iconic 💕💕
I didn't like it. Previous videos were more atmospheric and sophisticated 😔
I didn't think this needed to be said, but you shouldn't get into cars or boxes even if a sexy woman tells you to.
😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
SHE!!!!
That one bearded trucker’s expression had me on the floor 🤣🤣🤣
amooooo, esperando album novo
For anyone who was wondering, the guy in the video is Deaken Bluman. You might remember him as Monty's boyfriend if you watched Season 3 of 13 Reasons Why. He lowkey looks like the cousin of Alex and Nat Wolf
Need BANKS + Lil NasX collab
When I tell you I GASPED to see a new BANKS video....I mean it.
alors...j'ai pas compris
Isn't that the dude from 13 Reasons Why?
<3
LYRICS: [Chorus] I'm the devil and I speed with the pedal on the gas And I think I like the fa— (Ha-ha-ha) I'm the devil, did they tell you I'm the devil?

I never ordered this channel
I hope they play this song in hell
I was so scarrd that she was gonna change her style completely like some artist do. She's definitely matured but somehow maintained her original self.
O👏M👏G👏🔥😅
GET IT!!!! 😈🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow she is amazing
Y delete TY !!!!!!!!
Hell yeaaah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fu2B2SJWqnU&t=23s
i fucking love you.
Deaken Bluman (known from 13 reasons why) 🤩
This clip would do great with some black metal or any goth rock music on it, it looks like a Marylin Manson video without Marylin Manson.
Maybe she "sold her soul"
Wow I love all of this...just except for the part where she eats the rose because that was weird but besides that this is great lol😊💕
Suspiria vibes
Goddess❤️❤️🔥
when did you discovered this artist?
Why has this not hit 1m views yet ?
Tremenda canción para el ñato de abajo ja
did someone write her new name down??
OUVINDO NAS "ENTRENOTAS"
PQP!!!!!!!!
this is freaking amazing! YOU DESERVE THE WORLD
Great song love her! I like how it's not a long song it makes you wanna play it over and over again.. bumping this track volume max
And then Lucifer Morningstar and Chloe Decker pop up on the scene. They turn to Ella. "What happened?" Ella: "Last night several girls were erotically dancing after placing a young man in a box and locking it til he died from suffocation." Chloe: "Is there any other information?" Ella: "The one girl kept claiming to be the devil." Lucifer whips around. "Well that's just absurd. Everyone knows that I AM the DEVIL. Now excuse me, NOBODY gets away with pretending to be ME!"
Why does she look like blaire waldorf
Lucifer wife 👹
THAT'S INSANEEEEE OMGGGG I'M SO ADDICTED TO THIS SONG❤❤❤
Yet another who sold their soul for money.
VVitch and Suspiria vibesssss
You need Jesus in your live girl
Lana Del Rey already did this. Oh wait they’re both satanic witches
PERFECT SONG AND VID AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Mysterious times
1:21 GENIUS 🖤🖤
Hoping for doja and banks collab😘
Eyyy welcome back idol😘😘😘
Banks is SUPER HOT
I love being bi
this is boring
Algum brasileiro aqui ???
Saw her live 3 times and i can't wait til the next time. Goddess was perfection in every minute, can't tell how many times the songs have kept me company on lonely night drives and loud singing, almost celebrating pain, of breakup mind twists, mind games, depression, emtpy streets, love and hate and a longing for something you couldn't name.
THE GODDESS OF HELL <3
Devil is nothing . And these child of devil are very poor and miserable . One they all of them go to hell .
She’s an Angel dressed up as a Devil 🙏🏽
Gosh, Bluman's here
This song makes me feel like a villain…..              AND I FUCKING LOVE IT!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🖤
Banks a true music genius my fav is drowning love this 🔥🔥🔥💯💯
Did anyone notice that this mv is similar to Lana's Chemtrails mv?
Somebody in her family called her the devil… she took it and ran with it
I am here for it 😍🤍🖤 🔥
this woman is a creative genius. I don't know any other artist that makes songs quite like hers.
Есть кто от Резонанса?)
One of the most original artists and one of my all time favorites  Sexy while being classy  Talented and creative
ELA VOLTOU UU
Dá pra fazer umas orgias daoras ouvido essa música

This has been on repeat on Spotify.
I can't believe people like this music
SHEEEE
Banks manda beijo vc é minha fã
666 dislikes REALLY? xD
https://youtu.be/8Fw-_sS1itw
godfirst #goat #devil #antiKrysta! SWA = peace #worldRainbowGathering #4corners #rainbowGathering #potCreek #blockchain #brexit #bloodSetFree #Faith
Im literally arriving in a place seeing this if y'all catch my drift
Oh he'll mf'n yeah Banks & Tinashe!!!
"👹".
But she's not the The Devil she's The Lovers. Capricorn is The Devil. She be getting her tarot cards mixed up.
I feel some Travis Scotts vibes and this is beautiful 🤤
YESSS I MISSED BANKS
damn that was scary  then sexy then awesome to cool
Quando eu li Banks ja ia dar hater achando que era AZELIA BANKS se reinventando apos atacar ANITTA e muitos outros artistas kkk
Anyone know where I can get a red outfit like the dancers?
collabs BANKS should link: The Weeknd, Lana Del Rey, Halsey, Sabrina Claudio, Billie Eillish
She is My goddess 😅
Is that a IKEA ad?
she just got her initiation video into the Illuminati, prep for the huge blowup nothing subliminal about it..... watch 👀👹
It's her initiation song 👹! Have fun being soulless and forever unfulfilled.
That outfit 👌🔥🔥🔥🔥
Woooow we are in a new era
Not very impressed
she just keeps getting better!!!
did someone wrote her new name down?
I love your music
Crazyyy I love it, I love you ❤️
The queen is back
Efeitos toscos demais, não gostei
Hot Crazy Matrix you already know.
amazing song, BANKS is more magnificent than ever. love from brazil. 🖤✨
this song makes me want to slutty dance in the middle of a nightclub
Love the Devil's blood colored boots!
I know this is an attempt to be more mainstream and sexual but it just feels typical, along with the Christian iconology
Banks Witch! ❤️ 🇲🇽 MÉXICO HERE.
This video is 🔥! ❤️
Omg she's the devil 😲
Being bisexual means I like guys one cigarette away from dying and all women. So basically this whole video
OF COURSE THE DEVIL WOULD DRIVE A SLEEK BLACK MCLAREN of course
Forever a BANKS fan. 🔥🔥🔥🥀🥀💃🏽💃🏽
👁🤔👌🏻🤘🤘🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Omg amazing
I’m always so close to liking the music/videos…close
I Am The Sheitan.
For the love of god get new PR people. This should have millions upon millions of views.
i thought that man who turned around 0:12 was Julian Casablancas lmao
this video scares me
somehow this masterpiece reminds me of the craft movie
Great idea, terrible producer
Suspiria vibes ✨(Guadagnino's version)
#gimme
No don’t sell out you were perfect #Drowning #Underdog #Godess NOT #TheDevil
She’s so slept on and I don’t know why!
THE QUEEN IS BACK
The irony is that they miss that the Devil is only playing them on lust.  The olde devil is only concerned that people lust after the women in this video, which sets them back.  You lose your life if you keep it up with these temptations, and it will be a long time before you get over it as you deal with your lust in the next life.  So ruddy long that by the time you finally get around to organizing and ordering your life properly, ready for eternal life on Earth, there are countless souls in the new expanding world which are well established as the rocks of society and have all the rights and, because you let the devil do his business with your lust, you get set back to 'Nobody' in the world to come, a once formerly glorious potentiality reduced to menial servanthood to the saints who got over sin and ended up the economic strongholds in life.  Put your faith in another lifeform all you want - you'll pay every last penny for your lusts and lose out with life.
She's stunning! Saw her live in London November 2019 amazing!!!
holy hell my bisexual ass is quacking rn
Queen Reminded me of marilyn manson whispering
The bodys on those dancers  Damm 👑
AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL TUNE
And at that moment he knew that he fuked up 🤣🤣
Cruella and Lucifer missed out on using this track dammit
IS THAT JULIAN CASABLANCAS?
respectfully looking, happy pride everyone!
SHE DID THAT!!! 🔥🔥😈
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
*writes her new name down* Beautiful voice and video. 2021 giving us new Banks, Lorde, Khordelia and London Grammar. Things are looking up.
Also is that guy Issac Presley from Stuck in the middle it looks like him
SANGUE DE JESUS TEM PODER QUE DELÍCIA
I will always respect her artistry...started off as a huge fan, however this is where I draw the line...Now that you feel most comfortable to reveal yourself...I have too much dercerment to continue to be fooled & lured by your sweet voice & gorgeous looks. Jillian, you is a straight JEZEBEL... Which maketh thine enemy. Enjoy your fame while it last...For that will be your only reward. What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul? 🤷🏾‍♀️
don’t know how to feel about this song..
Claustrophobia on the roof but go offffff keep serving!
super fuckin sick, I especially love the dance scene at the end.
Love love love
I’M OBSESSED
Uff Winston, el que sale en #13reasonswhy
This is definitely giving me Salem from the WGN network. Uggh i miss that show so much. This was a serve we needed 💅🏾
A DONA VOLTOOOOUUUUUU AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
i agree
i loved it
YES MOM
I used Banks as inspiration for my succubus character, and my bday is in a week. So I feel like I just got given the best bday present ever!!
Anyone has info about her upcoming album ?
Jennifer’s Body vibes and I’m here for itttt
Горячо
This my new fav song
Love banks sense goddess
PHUCKINGGGG YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Amooooo
Muito bonito, mesmo. Imagino que tenha sido um clipe caro, mas faltou melhores enquadramentos e transições pra ser mais perfeito. A música é ótima como sempre.
I hope that box has air holes. Also, I was hoping that guy would succeed in establishing a relationship with one of the women.
Latindo por essa mulher
I'm here everyday
Jesus is the way the truth and the life. God sent his only begotten Son so that you can have everlasting life. Place your faith in Jesus. Trust Jesus. Jesus Christ. Jesus saves. Jesus conqueres. Calvary Cross. The Blood. Salvation. Gospel. Heaven.    God bless you.
IS THAT WINSTON FROM 13 REASONS WHY OR AM I HALLUCINATING
Im obsessed...it took me a minute or more just to process the thumbnail
Quite like this song, sadly it's so short.
The dancing is seriously hot.
So wild !!
So stunning !!!!!

How disappointing on so many levels. Another puppet ☹️
Why is everything about the Devil/ Satan now?  🙄🤦🏻‍♀️
I'm so obsessed
gnt, pra q?
Lovewow
Banks owes me a new soul. Who the eff do you think you are, just stealing my soul like that?! Such a true gift to us. Banks got me through a few bad times and this is made me so happy.
Lil Nas X entered the chat
Poor girl could just not pull in the views for this one… :/
Took me a few replays to catch the face transformation at 1:40. Lol Wicked.
THE QUEEN IS BACK
Everything gotta be about sex?
The editing of the video is a little jarring and not something I was expecting from a BANKS music video but other than that this is some good shit.
Only Banks comes out of lockdown hotter than ever!
It's the whole video for me...👑
Everyone who wishes to play with the Devil will get to live with him 365/ 27 & 7 forever if you really want to, while Jesus the Christ is the Kindest and most perfect loving sacrifice soul you would even meet and ignored for the loser. Jesus' blood on the cross, into the burial and out of the grace into new eternal life for anyone who wants it, still saves. There is still hope and a bright new forever with the Light , who is all Good. I am going with the Light.  If you were being deceived, would you want to know it?  Much love and pray you get born again and forgiven in the Messiah, Jesus.
Perfect!
I can't believe Banks just spat on me 🥺🥺🥺🙏🙏🙏
Is it just me or does any of you guys get tongue tide trying to sing “someone write my new name down”
SHE SOLD HER SOUL TO THE DEVIL 😈
MORE LUCIFERIAN WORSHIP KEEP IT UP COVIDIOTS YOUR HELL AWAITS
okey but SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
wtf banks, why the hell r u so stunnin'?!?! love u
diosa única bonita c':
omg she never misses
Oh my devil.... Thanks yt for recomending me this
We miss the Goddess era. We miss that truly dark evil sensual vibe that was a bit less pop.
This song is a spell. A powerful, ancient, esnaring one.
Queen every time
Ok, I love the song, yes it's too short, no I don't care about the dude or the CGI whatsoever but can we talk about the sheer Queen of the Underworld power of the choreo? Like she's just waving her hand or even finger and everyone obeys... I LOVE IT. I won't complain about the actual dance moves though, so much feminine badassery and sensuality with two absolutely gorgeous aesthetics 🥵
I’ve missed u godess ♥️
My mom would slap the life out of me if she knew I watched this lol
Eww this is so far from her old stuff I can’t. This just reeks of some typical Hollywood writer.
the devil release for your birthday! happy belated birthday! love ya!
Okay fellas, quick question?  If you were to be done by Vampires that look like this.  Would it be fair to at least ask for the final happy ending?    I mean they are going to kill you... maybe we can trade consent here.
Suspiria 😍
This was kinda bad?
I’m getting serious “Bedazzled” vibes, here for it 🙋🏻‍♀️💋🖤
Suspiria 2018 feelings. I like it!
OMG! Some one please help! Where else does she do some of the choreography in this? Am I just crazy? The whole mouth wipe thing, and that first shot where she makes that still face that's so eerie....where else is that from??? I've already searched thru a bunch of videos and I can't find where I've seen her do it before!
She should collaborate with Maruv, it could be lit 💯 this song its addictive 👌🏻
Banks is getting ridiculous in her murmuring lyrics that are completely impossible to understand.
Nunca decepciona
We stan even more
Gente quem é essa mulher que nunca ouvi porém já comecei a amar????
amazing work. keep it up watching from kenya
this mv reminds me a bit of the Suspiria remake, beautiful yet disturbing...
I have known her for five years and I have NEVER, NOT EVEN AT ONCE, been disappointed in her music. She is the DEVIL GODDESS
My soul is listening 👻
I love deaken bluman!! ❤️
I don't think I've ever been so excited to hear a song or watch a video before ❤
Producers: How sexy do you want your video? Banks: yes
nice babyyy
This is so addictive
this sounds so uninspired
WHO IS THE GUY IN THE FILM CLIP? I HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE
Yesss❤️❤️❤️
Adoro a musica mas o clip é péssimo
i want to be in a Banks music video!! where does she post for casting background or any roles??
This is very dark.
Her voice is pure silk!
Release Hands on Me, Fuuuuuckkkkkk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fire, sensual and sexy vocals.
Is she psycho or what.?? What kind of context she brings into her songs?
omg just when i thought her last era was her best she’s puts out this
Been waiting on the corner of happy and healthy since 1901.😉🎯🤎
About time!! ❤️‍🔥
Can you imagine a world without music? How would you feel about it? What would you miss the most?  Te imaginas un mundo sin música? Como te sentirias? Que seria lo que mas extrañarias?
Thanks to all musicians for making life better! I know from my own experience that life can get tough, but if you listen to good songs you can get through it and keep going. Made some playlists for many moments in life. Come listen to them and leave me your opinion. I'm getting started. Thanks!
What am I experiencing here
LEEESSS GOOOOOO😩😩😩🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YESSSSSSS
great video
way better than lil nas x montero.
ok i wanna learn that dance
Put it on 0.75 speed and let it simmer.
she IS the moment
❤❤❤

The best❤️
BANKS CONJURED THIS DEVIL AT THE ALTAR OF THE GODDESS.   SHE CONJURED ON A COUNT OF THREE.  GREAT SONG....BANKS IS THE TRUE GODDESS.... JUNE 2021.....HAPPY BIRTHDAY BANKS.....
Isnt modern music complete and utter shite, i would not even call it music, and the videos are downright filth and near porn. Not something you want children viewing or listening to. Disgraceful.
MAMACITA EU TENHO FAMÍLIAAAAAAAA
Banks the evil version of Lorde right now
This is beyond iconic, I will watch this forever
Is that the guy from 13 reasons why?
obsessed w shawty def not my type music but fuck allat i been payin attention
love banks but what in the dj mustard is this dated production.... this sounds like Feeling myself by will.i.am and miley lol
🔥 🔥🔥
BANG 💛
Can someone please explain why she puts the guy in the box? And what is she going to do with him? I want to understand the meaning behind it.
Hell yes! Love the song and the video! <3 Banks
SIS DELIVERED! I'M IN LOVE
Oh shit she is so sexy, and this track is a real banger!
VEM DIABA
YAS QUEEN cobra esa deuda histórica
this music video is so badly made i dont even comment on youtube videos but this had to be said
I could listen to this song for hours on repeat
Interesting, I alway look forward to watching what comes next.
ELA DEU O NOMEEEEEEE!!! PERFEITA SEMPRE <3
I’m sure I released this song on Soundcloud four months ago! Pirate- Face... copy cat.  https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/Zci2LksPmpNWhsMR8
ela voltou galera
She is everything and more!
GIVING ME ALL HANDS ON DECK VIBES. ANYONE ELSE?
Yessss omg anything she sings and creates is magic ✨
The evil queen.
Oooohhh El Diablooo
I love you, but I confused with this visual... search “sinetron indosiar” on google and you’ll find what I meant. This is just like that
Someone write her new name down
I love this song but it does remind me of boss by nct
⚡⚡⚡
❤️‍🔥
This music season is about to be so fire omg.
Conservative people freak out because of Montero video (Lil Nas X). Imagine if they see that. So good ahah. 😂😁
I just screamed so loud I woke up my neighbors
Goddess 🔥
I would let her lock me up in that box too
Im disappointed! Still love her and her style 😊
Not crazy for this song but still can’t wait for the new album. She’s underrated af it’s kind of sad.
...that's how I drive!
so excited for the next era (!!!)
Бесовщина какая-то(((
WE WON MUSIC IS SAVED
The more I listen the more obsessed I get!!! This one is a grower!
Girl's KILLING IT YESSSSSSSS <3
Should be mashup with Iggy Azalea ’s Song or Pretty Girls Britney
this mv is masterpiece
girl i-
PODE ANOTAR QUE É O DIABO CARAIO AAAAA
i missed her so fucking much!!! thank you ms devil for blessing us <333
Say hi to your girlfriends for me.
This thing you do near the beginning where you spread your legs and place your hands on your inner thighs .. uh, this evoked from me an unexpected sound. A noise.  I wouldnt call it a grunt or a groan, but certainly in that direction. That move hit its mark. In care you were wondering. Did you do that on purpose. My intuition says you did.  I dont know exactly why it had that effect on me, but it did. Love, Dad
This is so good!
I love her..she's another level.thanks for sharing this greatest masterpiece.Love from Indonesia
Entenda, você é tudo pra mim  kk ❤️
THISSSS IS SOTY
Wow. I almost had to pause this because the visuals were working me so hard. This dude in the video - I bet he has been having some interesting dreams of late.
Armaria! Amei?
Mother Lilith
Let's talk about that masterpiece 😳😳😳😍😍😍🥴❤️
Love banks, but I just can't with the whole Satanic thing. Jesus is Lord!!!
Literally, the final rose. 🥀
Chemtrails over the country club video, eres tú....?
omg queen
I have clicked this faster before
What the f... THIS SHIT IS SCARY!!! LOL
🖤🔥
THIS IS SOOOO GOOD?!! ESPECIALLY THE ENDING. THE MATCHING CUTS FROM THE COREOS IN BOTH SETS WAS SO SATISFYING TO WATCH
🥱🥱
All this satanism imagery is so tired and played out 🙄🥱😒
Lil Nas : Let me lap dance the devil Banks : Am the devil..lemme dance for you.
daaa <3
Perfeito
Niceeee
BANKS seriously deserves to go worldwide ❤️
This is pure perfection omd
Did she… yall saw that? She spit on us.
That was like a sexy horror movie
Beautiful! Could you release the full version of hands on me too? ❤️‍🔥
Vc é maravilhosa mulher nossa 😍❤️
No other artist has a more perfect discography than BANKS. SHE IS EVERYTHING!!!
Excellent song...Thank you, Banks
SOMEONE WRITE MY NEW NAME DOWN! SOMEONE WRITE MY NEW NAME DOWN!
There's so much power in everything she makes.
SHE’S BACK AND SHE’S BADDER THAN EVER!!!! (Also can u guys check my Gemini Feed cover? It would mean the world to me 😊)
VOLTOU AINDA MAIS DEVASSA AMO
YESSS DEAKEN YESSSSSSS
This totally lacks BANKS's true artistry, creativity, softness, and uniqueness. Just another cliche video with the cheesy concept of girl seduces boy to his doom. I love BANKS so much, but it really seems she's aiming here towards commercial success at the expense of her artistic integrity. I really expected more from her. So, disappointed...
its so true :D
She’s god
I TOLD Y'ALL SHE'S A WITCH!!!
Disappointing.....so basic....so uneventful....but I still love you Banks.
QUEEN
White Magic and White Witches, White Light and well wishes.. Wherever have you gone and why have you been consumed by treachery?  Banks.. You lost a fan, but its okay you've joined the ranks of those who feed the darkness in an attempt to swallow the world.  7 fold my dear... And 7 years.
Jill got mooooovvvesss 💃🏻👿🔥
the best +++++
❤🥵
The song has been on repeat all day!!! It's a success. And I love the music video!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍😍😍
THANK U FOR THIS 🔥🖤
Love it !
This aint it sis, what happened to you? You sound completely uninspired, these corny ass graphics on the car??I used to look at you as a passionate artist, but this sounds like a song in passing switching the radio station… like you dont give a fuck.i felt these same after the last album (III) which was supposed to be full circle on your artistry as you said , but i can tell just by the way you sing and your melodies alone that you dont care girl, sad. Just get you dollar and go home i guess, you know the gays eat that shit up anyways.sad
Love how she says, "I ain't the nice one"
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Aaaah lindaaa..... Tá repreendido. Banks mulher kk esqueceu que tem fãs evangélicos?
What in the exorcism is this
Banks confirming once again that I’m gay af 🥵
2:09 from *horny* to *claustrophobic* in like three seconds
DEAKEN!! 💜
Hell yes devil queen!!!!!! Loving this!
DONA DO OCULTISMO!!!! 🖤 possui meu corpo Banks 🔥
The Goddess is back looking hotter than ever.🔥🔥
This is really bad, I was not expecting this
Que diabla . La amo
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
1. This beat is SO 2014 2. I don’t understand half of what she’s saying  3. Video is a hot mess   Sorry girl but this ain’t it, you can do wayyy better than this. Waiting for the next single/video.
When they tell you that you can't love someone you don't know. Show them this queen <3
So I heard this is the first song she ever released as an independent artist. Does that mean that she got dropped from her previous label?
O pacto foi renovado 🔥🖤
THIS IS EVERYTHING
J'adore 🇫🇷
This is not what I was expecting
RED IS DEFINITELY HER COLOUR WHEWW🥵🤒
QUE MULHER MARAVILHOSAAAA!
iconic, inspiring, impressive, incredible 🔥
SUPREME!
Special ..
HOLY SHIT I HAVE MISSED BANKS SO MUCH THIS IS DOPE!!!!
I do not consent. God is the only presence and power on earth
The queen is back and we’re here for it! 💃🏻
If she is the devil can I please go to hell? 🙄
So amazing ♥️♥️🇧🇷
I'd sell my soul for BANKS, no regrets
I love you Banks but this music video wasn’t directed well.
My queen. Yaas.
Frickin goddess. 🙌🏻
But also I need this whole entire red outfit, because talk about understated sexy 🥵
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
BANKS leave the guy inside a box using pants, and then he appears without them. Definately The Devil, amazing.
LOVE BANKS! Doesn’t disappoint
bop queen.
I'm the only one that liked the video before listening to the song?? 😍😍
OKAY BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY FIRE THOUGH!!!!!! hell yes banks!!!!!!
Serpentina the Devil Pepper
a lot of people in the charts have ripped off her old style and don't give her credit for it. She truly is a trend setter. ❤️
LET'S WRITE HER NEW NAME DOWN!!! QUEEN
YES ❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍
She told us she was godless, now she’s the devil 🙏🏻 praise be
the beat reminded me of Fancy by Iggy Azaelia
HER BEST MUSIC VIDEO
Such a bad bitch! Love it
Why does this video remind me so much of Chemicals Over the Country Club by Lana Del Rey ???? I am not judging, of course, but there are many similar things here
hi. I love you.
ALWAYS SERVING. Banks, you did that!!!
Yesss, BANKS! These lyrics, this song and video! I-C-O-N-I-C!!!! ⛧
she's a good one.
*Panics in bisexual*
Богиня 🖤

Lucifer's twerking to this bop ❤️
I LOVE THIS!! BANKS ALWAYS COMES BACK WITH A BANGER
From praying to you because you're a goddess I'll also sell to my soul to your devil 💖

BANKS can do no wrong
This is so disappointing, 2:51 of Banks is not nearly enough.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Yessss! Can’t wait for more!!
GIRL...  🙌  Yessss.
te amo mamãe
I cannot wait for the rest of this era🖤❤
WTF???
Lilith ❤️
this is so satisfying
Perfeitaaaa te amo coloquem em alta no BR genteee ❤️
I can smell her breath from all the whispering
Imagine getting paid for Banks to trap you in a box and spit on you
BANKS could make a remake of the ABC’s and it would still be amazing AF.
FINALLY
amazing <3
oooooo yes this is the one
Banks and Lorde releasing new songs within a few days of each other? What miracle is this?
and now she’s back 😀 never been more hyped
SALAM DARI INDONESIA !
Mano... Não. Consigo. Não. Ser. Gado. Dessa. Mulher.
1:24-1:48😍😍😍
BANKS went from  Goddess, Judas, Godless, and now The DEvil... The character development is beyond iconic
Love it. More please.
The Empress is here
OMFG QUEEN!!! 👑😍🔥
in love with this choreography <3
I wonder if she locked jimmy in that box
deixou de ser preguiçosa e entregou O CLIPE

The fucking queen is back.
Well... the production of the video is FIRE! but the song... u.u
Gemini queen is back 👑
Yes Miss Banks!!!!!!!!
Can't wait to choreograph to this vibe.
Queen 👑
this genre of BANKS mv is just🥵🥵🥵
The perfect song to play at the church bbq😇
THIS IS WHEN SHE MAKES IT EVEN BIGGER 👏🏽 manifesting it
idk man,..I expected more. And I'm tired of this under 3 minute trend going on, which seems likely to be just to get as many streams as possible out of one track. Also, tbh, I get hella Terror Jr vibes from this track and video. I love BANKS. I just expected more. Just my honest opinion here, no need to @ me if you disagree.
Not me converting to satanism after this omg
Hey queen, you did it again!
I feel like I'm living again ❤
THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!!!!!
Eita! 😍😱 amei 🔥🔥🔥♥️
Banks ALWAYS do a perfect job
I love this!
PELO AMOR DE DEUSSSSS
She Sometimes Looks Like Demi Moore 🥰
If the TV show “Lucifer” was still on…this would song would have been amazing for the opening credits!!
I AM SO READY FOR THIS NEW ERAAAA!!!!
I'm sorry but this is not enjoyable
Amo 💖
Queen shit

bank’s music makes me want to commit arson 😩
Sadly I’m not a fan of this.
She is literally the best!!!!!
Does anyone know if this is a single or if there’s an album?
I missed her I’m so happy
Bullshit!
I see some prodigal son's reference 🤣🔥
"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes in Him shall never die but have eternal life." These Satanists will only bring you death and pain. Hell is real.
Literally spat on us and we're thanking her. Iconic.
Awesome. Though, wow. ;)
Your dancing literally slayed my life🔥🔥🔥
Maravilhosaaaaa
Repent sinners OWO
Moms back
Mama is back!

I wish the Russian scene was included in the video. A disclaimer could have been added to the beginning of the video so it can be uploaded on YouTube. It really completes the video imo

THE QUEEN IS BACK
My Queen is back.
Ну,что сказать. Отломать руки оператору, монтажёру, ребятам,отвечающим за спец. эффекты, сценаристу,режиссёру, композитору..пальцы писать устали. Несуразно. Видимо, весь бюджет ушёл на аренду тачки. Печально. Деградация. Попытка сделать нечто чувственное скатилась в дешёвую пошлость.Эти крики в песне.. Видимо из самого Ада. Провокационно? Нет. Свежо? Нет. Цепляет? Нет.
😍😍😍😍😍
THE BEST
Obsessed
Loooove the song and video!!

Looking forward to having the honor of listening to your beautiful voice that you have, greetings from the Mexican Caribbean jillian🍉🏖🇲🇽♥️ Te amo Banks ,mi chingona algún día te conoceré....
La muerte, es uno de los eventos más grandes que jamás tendrá lugar en tu vida.   Afrontamos la muerte todos los días, consciente o inconscientemente de ella; la muerte acecha en cada rincón de nuestra vida. Como un león esperando atrapar a su presa, la muerte nos llega a todos en muchas formas y formas; aparentemente no hay nadie que pueda escapar de las fauces de la muerte.   ¿Pero sabías que hay una razón por la que morimos? La idea de la muerte con la que está familiarizado es solo la punta del iceberg. Mira, morimos porque hemos pecado contra Dios. La muerte según la Biblia es paga "porque la paga del pecado es muerte" (Romanos 6:23).Debido a que el hombre pecó contra Dios, vivimos en un mundo caído, antes era perfecto, pero ahora está en ruinas. Ahora que el pecado existe, Dios viene a juzgar al mundo con justicia. Está establecido que un hombre muera una vez y después de este juicio "(Hebreos 9:27). El estándar por el que te juzgará son los 10 mandamientos, la ley moral de Dios.   Él es tan serio acerca del pecado que le dio a cualquiera que pecara la sentencia de muerte, la Biblia dice que te la has ganado pecando contra Dios y cada vez que pecas, acumula su ira. "El alma que pecare, esa morirá". (Ezequiel 18: 4) El castigo son los fuegos eternos del Infierno "Donde habrá llanto y crujir de dientes" (Mateo 13:42)   Tendrás que enfrentarte a Dios el Día del Juicio.   ¿Irás al cielo o al infierno?   Aquí hay una prueba rápida:   1-No tendrás otros dioses delante de mí. 2-No harás ídolos. 3-No tomarás el nombre del Señor tu Dios en vano, porque el Señor no dará por inocente al que tome su nombre en vano. 4-Recuerda el día de reposo. 5-Honra a tu padre y a tu madre. 6-No matarás. 7-No cometerás adulterio. 8-No robarás. 9-No mentirás. 10-No codiciarás.   ¿Alguna vez has dicho una mentira? robado algo? usó el nombre de Dios en vano? ¿Alguna vez has mirado a alguien con lujuria? Él ve la lujuria como adulterio, “Cualquiera que mira a una mujer con codicia, ya adulteró con ella en su corazón” (Mateo 5:28). ¿Alguna vez has odiado a alguien? él ve el odio como un asesinato, "Cualquiera que odie a otro hermano o hermana es un homicida" (1 Juan 3:15)   Santiago 2:10 dice, "la persona que guarda todas las leyes excepto una es tan culpable como una persona que ha quebrantado todas las leyes de Dios".   No confíe en su propia bondad o buenas obras para salvarlo. Eso es como sobornar a Dios para que te deje entrar al cielo; Ni una iglesia, pastor, sacerdote o religión alguna. Ninguno de nosotros es bueno en absoluto, incluso los asesinos, violadores, incluso Hilter se llamarán buenos y tratarán de justificarse por sus buenas obras. Pero la biblia dice:   • "Pero todos somos como cosa inmunda, y todas nuestras justicias son como trapos de inmundicia; nos marchitamos como una hoja, y nuestras iniquidades, como el viento nos llevaron". (Isaías 64: 6)   La definición de Dios del bien es moralmente excelente y, por lo tanto, exige perfecciones absolutas. Nadie puede igualar sus estándares. Por eso Jesús dijo: • "Nadie es bueno sino solo Dios". (Lucas 18:19)   Si ha hecho alguna de esas cosas, Dios lo ve como culpable de quebrantar su ley y la Biblia advierte que los culpables terminarán en el infierno. ¿Serás culpable el día del juicio final?   "Porque la paga del pecado es muerte, pero la dádiva de Dios es vida eterna en Cristo Jesús Señor nuestro". (Romanos 6:23)   Dios envió a su Hijo a sufrir y morir en la cruz. Jesús tomó el castigo sobre sí mismo y derrotó a la muerte en la cruz; no por tu Bien sino porque Dios es rico en misericordia.   "Porque tanto amó Dios al mundo que dio a su Hijo unigénito, el que en él cree no se pierda, sino que tenga vida eterna". (Juan 3:16)   Jesús resucitó de entre los muertos y venció a la muerte. Arrepiéntete (vuélvete del pecado) hoy y confía en Jesús y Dios te concederá vida eterna; también nacerás de nuevo.   Él te dará un corazón nuevo que desea la justicia, lo que es justo y un corazón que amará a Dios.   por eso Jesús dijo: "De cierto, de cierto os digo, que el que no nazca de nuevo, no puede ver el reino de Dios". (Juan 3: 3)   Luego, lea la Biblia y obedezca lo que lee.   ☆ ¿Cuándo vas a estar bien con Dios?   "Hoy, si escuchan su voz, no endurezcan su corazón como lo hicieron en la rebelión" (Hebreos 3:15) "Ahora es el tiempo aceptable, he aquí ahora el día de salvación". (2 Corintios 6: 2)   • "Tampoco hay salvación en ningún otro, porque no hay otro nombre bajo el cielo dado a los hombres en el que podamos ser salvos". (Hechos 4:12)   Es tu elección. Los dejo con esto: "¿De qué le aprovechará al hombre si gana el mundo entero y pierde su alma?" (Marcos 8:36).   Si te estás tomando esto en serio, ¿te gustaría una oración? Esta oración no es garantía de que serás salvo, eso es entre tú y Dios. Sin embargo, me gustaría que este fuera un buen comienzo para su viaje.   "Padre, te agradezco por el corazón abierto de esta persona y le pido que se arrepienta y confíe solo en Jesucristo. También te pido que guíes sus pasos en su camino para que pasen de la muerte a la vida. En el nombre de Jesús Amén.

Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and forms; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death.  But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23).  Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law.  He's so serious about sin that he gives anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and God pays you in death. Each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 13:42)  You will have to face God on Judgement Day.   Will you go to Heaven or Hell?  Here’s a quick test:   1.You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)   2.You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)   3.You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)   4.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.   5.Honor your father and mother.   6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder, 1 John 3:15).   7. You shall not commit adultery. ("Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).   8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).   9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).   10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealousy desired what belongs to others?)   James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.”    The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts.   If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day?    "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)   God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because you're Good but because God is rich in mercy.   “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)   Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life.   Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.   Pray something like this:   "Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). Today I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."   When you find time please read this, it's Christian principles for growth:   https://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/
