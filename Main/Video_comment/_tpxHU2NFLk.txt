hello big georgy i love u

I love you bald head! Now that's scripture!
Mr.Foreman i have an idea that me and you and other famous athletes and music artists and actors work together to make an athletic/music/acting/nursing and sports therapy college by seizing colleges that teach computer hacking and give students access to spy computer programs leaving people vurnable to be victims of federal wire tap act violations and invasion of privacy and hippa violations and idenity fraud and deformation of charachter and misrepesentation and propaganda murder 3 and other crimes created by using private information as content on the internet and tv because people act accordingly to there audience and web cam hacking creates so many thefts and peeping tom situations and misrepresentation with the web cam hacking and what not.
Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act. Im a survivor!!

Not a heavyweight but what did you think of Prince Naseem Hamed
The great George foreman
my hero george foreman 💘
Loved him on HBO.  He always told it like it was.  One of my favorite boxers.
george was a bad man so powerful
You dont argue with The Legend.
Sir, Iam big fan of you !!
I love George Foreman- he looks absolutely amazing. Hard to believe he's 72.
👍
Shavers and Foreman, the two hardest punchers in Boxing history, also happen to both be among the most humble 👍
With a high endorsement from a great man like George foreman.Its good enough for me .👏👏👏👏
God 🙏🙏🙏 bless you sir hoping you are always healthy and happy with your family.
King foreman👍🇹🇷
I have so much respect for this man…he truly is one of the greatest sportsmen of all time and a true source of inspiration and wisdom.    Now I am off to buy his grill.
Is this his official channel as am dubious about the subs I would have thought he would open up with at least a few 100 thousand subs.
George  is on of best fighters  in  history
George, god bless you!
George looks almost exactly like he did in the 90s.
Sir, you are such a legend! I'm two years older than you were when you re-conquered the belt! It's a great reminder of what our body can achieve if put our minds and spirit into it. THANKS BEYOND YOUR AMAZING SPORTSMANSHIP, THE EXAMPLE YOU'VE SET.  Respectfully!
I bet there is a part of you thhat wants to get back in the ring again
Hey there champ. No one wanted either of them to get hurt. It was a great fight
That was very nice of you to present the fight overall in the exact way it was sir. Thank you 🙏🏽
Big George Foreman. TBE! 🙏🏻👊
Love you George
just love this bloke xx
Big George is such a wonderful man. I am blessedto watch your videos.
Does anyone know what fight is shown behind big George on the left?
Greatest living legand sportsman.
I am sure you can knock out both of them in two rounds.
These fighters would be demolished by you
Why didn’t you ever fight him again.  The whole world knew that you could destroy Clay if you fought smarter.  You know you can. Why didn’t you. Please tell me the truth
Hello the real wise champion, King of the King ... KO.... there is only one rival in your life... your best friend Muhammad Ali 🙏
I am a singer and songwriter.  I am working on a song about Big George, in progress, here is another of my songs about boxer Jerry Quarry called The  Contender (the ballad of Jerry Quarry).   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUZTET9KMdI
George....you are one of the last Champs of the old times.
We re happy to see you live long enough to see this too.
Always great to hear from Big George. What a class act.
George Foreman we ❤ you . may GOD keep you healthy and happy for as long as possible on this earth.
George concentrate on God's glory not man's. You have achieved nothing and we will never achieve anything but sonship by Jesus Christ.
This man speaks from the heart.
foreman, ali, and jack johnson. 3 legends!
Hello from Canada 🇨🇦,  champ!
Such a cool guy.  You are one for the ages George.
Okay grandpa, back to bed...
George would make a great boxing promoter.
Big George
Thanks Champ.
Великий большой Джордж Форман
I agree with George. This trilogy was the best thing for the boxing business in many years. The fans got a great show, people made money, and there were all good fights.
I want to know the punch-strengthening exercise routine you did
Mr. FOREMAN, I just have to say I respect you  and your career sooo much. I don’t know if this will get a reply, but you HAVE to know how much guys like me LOVE what you brought to the ring. Thank you for your heart, strength, and never giving up even as older fighter.
I agree thought the referee was great
Legend always loved big George
George, you made memories for all of us in your great fights too. You'll also be remembered for many years to come. God bless you.
Hi I'm korea fun. 건강하세요
Thank you George. True legend.
İt would be so good if george foreman talks about in one of his videos ; his boxing style, details and strategys, his deffance, i realy like his deffance his paratings is amazeing i realy like to see him talking about his style
big george the LEGEND
just missing music. A nice score to this would be official
Praise God. You are a hero. Good to see you here.
Prime George v Wilder. Prob would have lasted 3 rounds but could have been the wildest 3 rounds in HW history. But ifs dont matter like the Champ just said...
Why is a grill master commenting on boxing?
Thanks for that George, I’m off to pop something in the grill.
Well said George about the reff they deserve a mention especially when they are that good
George your grills are a pain in the ass to clean!  Lol
This is as good a review of a fight as I've heard in a long life. What a very decent man George is, calling it straight and not leaning towards one man or the other: a true Corinthian. He's right about heavyweight boxing being all the better for having Wilder and Fury in their prime at the same time and I hope that things stay that way in the future although right now I can't see anybody around who is fit to take on their mantle when eventually they retire. It will be interesting to see what Usyk can bring to the top of the division.
George Foreman is one of the greatest heavyweights of all times.  He kept ducking one fighter, though.  Who was it?  You guessed it. Frank Stallone.
Great to see George so happy about boxing ❤️
Thanks Big George,!=)
We Love you George !   Your smile is still so comforting.
I’ve have a fantasy fight question for gorge who wins young gorge from your early days or comeback gorge
AMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
In Zaire, do you still believe your water may have been  tampered with? Anything is possible.
Goerge ! Your just to cool!🤟
George I loved you as a boxer and I love your grills!
Thank you for posting this Mr. Foreman!  I'm inspired by you and your entire career.  Thanks for your comments on an amazing title fight!
george foreman the man we all love and respect
We’ll never stop talking about you George ! Legend!
We love you Big George !!!
How good the ref was, he allowed Wilder an illegal rabbit punch with no rebuke, it’s as clear as day, go back and revue the fight.
Who would of thought george forman would of still been alive in 2021 after growing up from the 50s 60s 70s 80s and 90s
You said that referee did a good job and the best referee ever to referee a fight That referee was horrible, terrible,and bias  The told fury no head locks and don't do it again I believe it was 3nd or 4th round Fury continue throughout the remainder of the fight with head locking Wilder because Fury knew he could not win without going against the rules of boxing Big George how did you miss from hearing and seeing this throughout the entire fight if you were watching the fight. How Not to mention the counting by the referee
I had another two burgers just now on your grill. God bless you x
Classic
You will always be one of my all time favorite boxers George!
Hey George.
What a great human being
You spittin' mad-knowledge, Big George ... Respect, good sir.
Insightful, generous and fair analysis delivered with the humility that only a Great could display. Thank you, Sir.
Well said
What about the holding n no breaks
thank you George, great analysis.
Nice George and ur bang on.  Great fight.   Modern day classic
I just want to say, I called this fight after the second match. Fury had actually won the first fight. I said then that Wilder did not want any more of Fury. He depends on the right hand for everything. He looked tired after the first three rounds.  He knockdown Fury twice. The big man rose of the canvas and said not today Wilder. Proceed to whip his ass post to post. Notice how great shape Fury was in.
Big George in my opinion is the greatest Heavyweight of all time,  won the title in two generations and greatest puncher in the greatest boxing era....
I enjoyed hearing your thoughts on this fight. I’ve watched all the great fights of the past 45 years, and you had many.       Ps( the sound on your channel (this video) has echo, needs some attention)
You are a really noble man. These are some great words and credit to these amazing fighters.
So good to see you looking so well George, and you're so humble in your tribute to Fury and Wilder.  Much respect 🙌
есть русские ?
Hey gorge great comments...I agree..real sportsman's ship for you to make room for Tyson fury 3 ,  among  other historic heavyweights,  with out comparison....looking good, thanks 😄
1:59 Truth 💯 The past is show by those two men
Love you, Big George! A true legend!
Never stop talking about you Gentlemen “ The Champions Forever “ !
Things will be coming out about that fight" and I believe it will be quite shameful.
GOD BLESS & BE HEALTHY  ALWAYS  SIR GEORGE FOREMAN ! Im now 46 y o, Im always watching your fights since I was a child !
Thank you champ for your analysis. It was a grueling fight and I'm always interested in your take on the fight as a legend of the sport and one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history. Thank you so much for your insight.
Hi Big  George - you are getting Wiser as you get older . Love from Ali❤️
Mr.Foreman it’s an honor and pleasure to have you still here with us, many have come and gone. Thank you for your words of wisdom and encouragement. Much respect sir! 💪🏾
George, keep it simple that's all wilder has got is a right hand,no stamina,and what I expected talks rubbish,that's it.
Watching this man  talk about anything, puts a smile on your face and a peace in your heart... Your the best Big George.
Big George your come back has been the biggest motivation ever
George, please come out of retirement and fight fury
Wow, Mr Foreman, it's great to hear and see you sounding and looking so good!  Boxing sermon!  It's great to hear and see it's not always the best in the past.
Great words from a classy ex Champion.
I dol....shout out me ...watching here in Philippines.....
Being so proud of you my legend. Love from Indonesia, Mr.George Foreman
Big George the legend!
So grateful to have the perspective of such a legend of the sport.
the future is so bright I must wear sunglasses. George, you are the best- god bless
It was the best HW fight in a long time but anyone old enough to remember the 90's knows it's nowhere near the top. The Holyfield/Bowe trilogy, Holyfield/Dokes or my personal favorite HW fight was Tua/Ibeabuchi. That was the best HW slugfest I've ever seen.
Thanks George for your measured response.  You give perspective and weight to what is sure to go down as one the classics.  I appreciate you calling it out, that this is these fighters time and we need to respect them for such a great showing.  You're the best.
Look at George still doing his thing! Love to see that. Still sharp as a tack and well spoken.  👍👏👏👏
Always a pleasure
LOOKING GOOD 👍
Boxing godfather
The most entertaining heavy hitter.
Thank you George!
My favourite heavyweight.
Is that Lewis v schmelling on the left ?
George foreman would have beat both these guys in one night.. Im open to comments. And im a fan of both fury and wilder.
What does a man who made a grilling machine know about boxing?
the people who did thumbs down are racist.
With all due respect Foreman is saying nothing
Foreman is the man.  Love to hear him commentate again
I am fanat Big George in Ukraine
George, you look like a really happy, kind man. Yet when you boxed I don't think anyone could have said you were anything other than intimidating! I find this contrast quite amusing, thanks for the memories, as well as your current thoughts 👍👊
Legend! Still loves boxing and can tell us why. True Great!

Look good Champ! Fury and Wilder are in the conversation with the legends. Lets never forget them
Good video George. Wilder is not a good boxer and is one dimensional. Fury isn't great either. Wilder has the worse balance that I've ever seen from a championship heavyweight boxer in history.
I reckon Wilder got some brain damage with those last few punches - he couldn't walk straight - that's the pity about the fight.
요한복음3:16🙏🐳
He has his own channel. That's great! I still think one of THE greatest events in any sports history, but this one happens to be Boxing, (which makes it even more astounding!), is George Foreman's comeback after a TEN YEAR layoff(!) AND at the age of 45(!) to take a title and fight on again. If you just think about that for a few minutes and aren't impressed, you're either stupid or dead inside. It was a phenomenal achievement and I hope to see the story memorialized in a film someday because it very much deserves it.  🥊💯
Foreman vs Ron Lyle was a belter of a fight and i only seen it recently!! what a fight!!!
What a legend, foreman is such a nice man.
Every said it was a good fight except fury fans they just don't wanna admit fury had to earn that belt whenever he fights wilder he gets put on his ass multiple times
Respect to Mr. Foreman from Greece. A true lion with a huge lion heart
Looking great George 💯
Legend George I remember the rumble in the jungle and  loved you since then
Lookin good george we love u champ!!!
George Foreman, you are one of my heroes of boxing, a legend. Thanks.
Love you George, I think you're the best.
There is nothing wrong in this. He showcased his talent and authority in ring. It's like enjoying title boxing with confidence.
U r a living legend of boxing world, & i respect you. But the fights was like, "kill by 100 cuts". Fury was totally controlling the fight. He was breaking Wilder round by round,  not knocking him down, giving him breather. And at end, ended up in style of showman. Ask him if i m wrong?
i am not agree Tyson Fury has not a good shape in his body  and Wilder lacks  high level of boxing
George a true Gentleman.
Honestly I really started to dislike Wilder. Originally just his fan base since they’d bring race, and outside bullshit into it. But after Wilder fired Breland, the one guy protecting him physically and his reputation. ( As Wilder could say he didn’t want the towel thrown in, “ I just need that 1 second”) and how he was treated after. Regardless after the second fight I hoped Wilder would train for 2-4 years, taking on different fights, improving then remarching Fury. Covid hit and DW did get that time, and sadly interrupted AJvTF and the complete unification boxing fans deserve. But Wilder did good. I hope he’s learned his lesson that excuses and being perfect for 1 second isn’t enough, and that he starts building up other skill sets. Hell he came into boxing late and had incredible success. I don’t doubt it’s too late.
Tyson really outclassed Wilder. 1st fight showed he can dance around all day, landing shots, slipping shots. 2nd: That he can bring on the fury. 3rd: Give Wilder a kind of fight he exceeds in, having countless opportunities to land his eraser. Great fight. I’m just worried for Fury, such big guys don’t keep their speed as long as guys like Mayweather and the Pac-Man. How much damage he took I hope he can still be in peak condition for AJ. ( Usyek would be an interesting fight too, and I’d bet more money on Usyk to beat Fury then AJ. Not because he beat AJ, but just because he’s like RJJ, incredibly fast, able to handle weight being put on him. His size has him able to get straight body and liver shots off to slow TF. But mainly want AJvsTF still.)
We need more reviews like this!
My prayer is the God would allow me to meet you Sr . You are truly a living Legend and a true man of God .
we love you George your words always make us feel a sense a warmth towards life and boxing 🙏
Oh Hell Yes!! I didn't know The Champ had a channel. Instant subscriber here!!! Good to see you, man!!!  I disagree though....you, Ali, Frasier, Norton. These names will always rise to the top. Never forget. Never forgotten.
George, your always the best. God Bless, Dennis C.
One of my top 5 Heavyweight fights was Big George VS Ron Lyle.  Think there was 7 knockdowns.  Both guys put on a show that may never be repeated ever !
GF maybe the greatest of all time. Love this guy.
Love that you enjoyed the fight  I enjoyed your fights it’s funny I still think you hit harder than any fighter in my time including Mike but that’s close
Foreman needs to back on tv and sell bras
I am a simple man... I see George, I subscribe...
God bless you champion! We love you
I bet that ref was wore and sore the next day
George Foreman is a national treasure.
I loved it when you came back in your 40's and kicked it. You are my favorite boxer of all time and the top one of few who really knew how to throw a punch and tough as nails.
George is built different. I can't believe how seemingly unaffected he is in old age after all the wars he went through. When people talk about the greatest chins in boxing history George has to be right up there.
I remember that George Foreman Ron Lyle fight boy that was brutal
George with Kiehl Wilder
Very much enjoyed listening to George. What a Trooper he is.
George Foreman is a global TREASURE.
Why didn't Ali ever give the revenge to George after the rumble in the jungle?
You are great George!!! Glad you looking well!
George Foreman! What a great fighter! What a charming gentleman. I’m hooked.
Damn! Not even TIME can beat BIG George!
Seem like he said a whole lot of nothing
There is only one winner and yes both fell and got up but one remained standing at the end just saying!!!
Get to the fukN point! My 2nd time trying to list to this long drawn out blah blah blah
You still got it Champ, you still got it!!!  #Foreman2024
Fury nor wilder would’ve been able to put up a good fight against foreman I’m pretty sure I can say that for everyone, he would’ve destroyed them both and was impossible to hurt! Always loved foreman he’s a humble man who’s made a good fortune but I genuinely think he’s the best heavyweights that has ever lived.
This fight reminded me of some of the great fights during your era. Norton vs Ali, Frazier vs Ali ( all 3 fights) and Lyle vs Foreman. Great to see this kind of matchup to hopefully get the excitement back in heavyweights like it was in the 70's.
Awesome big george.thanks for this
Totally agree on the referee. He did incredible and wasn’t scared of getting in between two giants!
Watched Ken Norton training for George Foreman in Caracas in 1974, George knocked him out in the second round he hit him with a body shot and said I knew he was mine
Watched Ken Norton training for George Foreman in Caracas in 1974 and a little fight club in San Diego
Geogre my favorite fight is when you fought against Evander holyfield.
Joe Rogan pull your finger out ya a**!  And get big George on! Man got mad experience! And his story alone is amazing
George Foreman couldn't be better at doing public relations for boxing than this video.  His comments are generous but accurate.  Foreman came across as aloof and cold when he was the champion but he now has the public persona of being everyone's favourite grandfather.
Prime george foreman KO's Prime Mike Tyson ......... CHANGE MY MIND.
George would have destroyed either of these fighters in his day, I have NO doubt !
i think one of ali's best traits was his resiliency. same goes for fury.
We will never stop talking about George Foreman! You are the hardest hitting heavyweight champion of all time.
George Foreman. A true gentleman. With wise words. You sir are a legend.
What a legend!!!
We love you George!
George you are the best and very humble spirit, wish more were like you
THE BOXING SMARTS and the ELOQUENCE IS EXTREMELY HARD TO TOP!!! AN ABSOLUTE LEGEND!!!
If anyone hasn’t seen George Foreman vs Ron Lyle, go check it out! Such a badass fight.
Love you big man ! Huge fan since the 70's
Tx Uncle George. Spot-on description of a great fight. And, as you rightly gives him credit, cudos to an excellent referee. God bless you Mr. Foreman. Meeting you in person is still on my bucket list
Yes this was a wonderful fight, shame wilder didn't shake hands at the end, the commitment from both boxers was exceptional, this fight warrented a hand shake and respect.
Nice to see Mr Foreman still in good shape ;-). Bless him!!
Everyone loves George.
Mr Foreman is a very very generous man.
My favorite champion
What a guy 🙌🏼
George you are the best!
Tyson Fury won, Wilder didn't lose.  I think that summarises the fight quite well.  And thank you George, bless you all.  (Rob UK)
Big George, you're the best ! We love you, from Brazil 🥊🇺🇸🇧🇷😎
Love this guy. Legend!
Well said.
“COUNTED OUT” no one has ever even had Wilder down in 45 fights. And they say Fury has pillow fists? 😂
Georges, mike tyson...nobody is crying for wilder,tyson fury is so great he transcends all nations and makes everybody happy.
Jesus Christ bless you brother!
Wilder is a sore loser, he told Fury after the match that he didn't wan to show respect or sportsmanship, an idiot at the least...
George still the greatest!
Yes George. That was an amazing fight. It will be historic
You were in a tittle fight with Michael Moore? You ended his boxing 🥊 career when you dropped him in the 9th round.
May God bless you George.
What a great man George is! Love to see him apparently healthy.
Thanks Pasto wor this great commentary of this great sport event!
That was great and so true what George said about the past and the present even though I think he's awesome...
Always been an insightful, respectful gentleman. Pure class.
Great analysis big George.  You hit it right on the head.
George your fight with Ron Lyle was one of the best fights I ever saw. Two behemoths pounding on each other for 5 knockdowns. EPIC
Love the commentary. Please consider using a lapel mic to improve the audio. Thank you.
Great work George, a good microphone would help a lot
George, neither fighter we saw in this fight could have gone but a few rounds with you.  The sport of boxing is not as good as it was when we were young.
George you are the man!   Thanks for the video it was awesome!
Came back to being a boxing fan after like 15 years away . Fury is the reason & You are right Big George !
Ron Lyle and Foreman goes unnoticed & what a great fight!
A great fight and a great review from the headmaster himself.
George we all were hoping you would have scolleded wilder for his brutal bad manners and poor sportsmanship for running away and not shaking congratulating FURY for knocking him out for the third time!!!!  wilder should be banned for his blm communist satanic behavior we detest that bag of shit and God bless FURY a true sportsman and CHAMPION
How am i just now finding out George Foreman has a Youtube Channel?
George should run for President
George is like the grandpa that i never had. Love this guy
George I would Like to purchase a painting or a photo of one of your KNOCK OUT BLOWS. Please put some on your sight for sale, thanks CHAMP
LOVE YOU GEORGE! YOUR WORDS HOLD WEIGHT CHAMP!
I thought I was watching a Rocky movie
As always George is a gentlemen and an overall nice guy!
You seem like a happy person
Get some sound dampening, George.
I loved watching George , Ali, Frazier and many others back in the day and then PPV came along and ruined it all. Have never paid to watch on TV and never will.
Thank you for the video George I've been watching you since I was 4 or 5 years old I love you man you're like Apple pie in America
George Foreman or should I say the Great George Foreman. In my opinion he was a greater fighter than Muhammad Ali. I heard him say that when he fought Ali he told his corner man that his water he was drinking between rounds tasted like medicine. So being the great honorable and humble man that George is, he did not accuse Ali of cheating even though there is a strong and I will say it was likely he was. George knowing what Ali meant to his fans and how much he was loved in the Black community did not and will not tarnish his name with unproven accusations. However the out come could have been different and George did not have to deal with the loss of confidence and the emotional trama of that defeat, and had he won, could now be known as the greatest fighter of his era. But in my opinion George is in the top 5 fighters in the heavyweight division. I will say he fought much better when he carried a little fat into the ring to give him a reserve of glucose to keep from slowing down in later rounds from burning all of his glucose out. But as George said If and could have and should have don't cut it, it is what it is. But I have the utmost respect for this man. Because he accepts the results of his life and career with dignity and does not allow excuses to cause him any bad feelings, he accepts the results with a smile, knowing in his heart he is doing the right thing. And that he is one of the greatest men and Champions ever because of his dignity as a man.
George, you are a class act. We love you!
Big Thanks Big George, thanks for visiting our church in Gainesville and sharing you testimony. God Bless!!
Thanks George you mega-legend champion! Love you man!
Respect absolu !
I admire how George Foreman reinvented himself. He is a knowledgeable but humble man who picked himself up from rock bottom. He gave kudos to Muhammad Ali, despite losing to him. He said that Ali could have delivered one more blow when he was going down in that great Ali-Foreman fight, but Ali did not, says, Foreman, which is what made him (Ali ), great among other qualities.
Foreman is a legend.
Foreman is one of the greatest of all time.. such a humble man! love you champ
What a wonderful  man you are.and I love my grill..God bless..love 💘 from the scotland....
Thank you Big George  it's good you are doing well  good to see.
Thanks George. Good to see you. Titan Title fight it was.…  PS. My George Foreman grill is literally the greatest invention ever. Thank you again.
What a gentleman you have become, and what an inspiration you are today! A smile, honesty, a tribute to these two fighters, no negatives. I wish others would learn from your style of living George. The world could use a few more of you!
The great Foreman’s got that amazing storytelling ability.
One of the greatest. Long live legend
Thanks Champ!
He's right, Fury and Wilder breathed new life into this division, their fights were pretty legendary.
wow... im still smiling from ear to ear as i type. wonderful to hear the great George Foreman say these words
George the best boxer ✝️💟😃
Great words champ !
Foreman a real OG for passing the torch. A wise man gracing us with his presence.
This is awesome, nice to see George foreman doing well
Always a big fan of George Forman. Believe that. Seattle Seahawks
Someone get this man a microphone. We love you George.
Mr. Foreman, its a pleasure to watch videos that you have been putting out. Keep learning, and keep your mind young. Cheers.
George has spoken
We'll never stop talking about you big George. You were simply the best, pound for pound, heavyweight, ever.   The power and perseverance that defined the division, forever and always.
Foreman was such a great fighter. He got outboxed by Ali but NOBODY ever matched Ali's skill, during the era in which he fought. And for Foreman to come back the way he did in the 1990s, well after all the other big men had long since hung them up, was nothing short of astounding. And to do it with a resounding knockout of a fighter in his prime, all the more so.   Thanks for the memories big George. You were ALL class, all the time. And I'd probably pick you as the greatest of all time.
Hi George ,thanks for your comments , I was just telling someone about your book , God in my corner , that I read about 3 times , and then gave it to a work mate who was a boxing fan , thanks George , from Tony McCarthy from bedfordshire England , 😊👍
great point about forgetting those old great fighters , this is a new generation.
Ya the Best George! A true legend in the sport
Love this classy MAN. God bless you Mr. George Foreman.
Thanks for your opinion Champ! You look great. God bless you and thank you to your contribution to the sport.
You're freaking awesome!
Fury & Wilder wouldn't of been considered as sparing partners to the likes of Ali Frazier Foreman Norton etc etc etc , what a brawl it was.
Saludos y bendiciones George desde Argentina !!! Te Amamos
Thank you King George!
Everbody love's you Champ great words
I loved watching George . When he hit ali I think ali shut up for about a minute.
God bless you Sir.
Love your energie man
Big George has always been a humble guy, (at least from what I know of commentating)! Put my name out of it, there are fighters to be talked about. Basically saying, fuk what I did! He's always given young fighters praise (no matter who they are) and didn't/don't hate!
George you look fantastic! Love from 🇬🇧 True gent!
Respect to BIG GEORGE FOREMAN!
Lovely speech, such a humble man and an awesome boxer too. God Bless you George :))
It's always good to hear George's opinion.
Looking sharp George! 🤜💥
I thought that the referee was brave by doing his job and it looked liked both fighters respected the referee.
I had no idea George foreman had a youtube channel  I would love to meet you one day  Love from France
Tyson Fury, a true gentleman, a true fighter and a true champion.
George is absolutely spot on about EVERYTHING in boxing reality. These boxing newcomers should take a page out of his book.
Wow George still looks like he's in his 50s , stay safe brother
thank you mr foreman
Truthfully who has Tyson Fury really fought? He frustrated an ageing Kilitscho and fought Deontay Wilder thrice. But Wilder’s a hype job, to be honest. It’s too early to be calling Fury one of the greats; he isn’t - yet.
Well Wilder lost so there were losers
Playback speed 1.25x
Some music would've hyped this big time. A legend talking
Fix the echo in your videos George, thank you.
I respect this man.
But.... what about "quick twitch muscles"?😂
Spot on George said like a champ
Mr. Foreman is always very respectful and humble in his comments. A true legend and a gentleman.
Surprised to see the Champ on YouTube. Well explained the fight.
Champion Foreman With his strength and might in the ring. He is also a very kind and polite person. I respect this man very much
Shout out to the elder Mr. Foreman. One of my top 5 heavyweights.
i think that if Dentoy Wilder had come to George Foreman as a trainer or consultant, the outcome might have been difference. GF is not just an incredible athlete and strength but a master tactician.
Absolute legend of the sport 👌🏻👑
Thank you George! Well done
To have legends who made it through who are not only enjoying a full life, but getting to see their sport in modern times with with excitement and enthusiasm...warms the heart.
George is a very likeable guy...a Good man!
I never seen a boxer like George,  he is great..
Love you Big Fuzzy! When Fury retires he'll be the GOAT. But it's still you, George ...
The great George. Always humble with tons of integrity.
Hello mr.George. Looking best🍸😎👏
Big respect to big George.
It was a great fight but perhaps not as great as Foreman-Lyle, the greatest slug fest of all time
A real champ. Thanks Mr.Foreman
Great Fight. Well said champ George.  Wilder has a big hart n determination n so did fury. Wilder lost but gained alot of respect form alot of people. Way to go champions!
You all better subscribe to this legend
Thank you George. Ali beating you in the jungle is still the greatest fight ever.
https://youtu.be/ZKURrjw2dmc
These words mean soo much more  oming from a living legend!
💥 Big George💥
I'm so happy that you have your own Youtube Channel, a legend like you. It's an honor sir.
No one ever gives credit to the ref. But he’s a soy right.
I love this video.  Perfect set of remarks by one of the Greatest.
Big George is magic man
What an endorsement! from the man himself * * Big George * * Undoubtedly one of the great Hall of Famers. He's looking and sounding really healthy too. Great stuff!
George is the man.
Thanks George for your service to the all time  forever champion our savior Jesus Christ.Stay the course!
Thank you Big George for this video.
Sorry George. That was a farce that would have been left for an undercard bout in the old days. There was no boxing involved just amateurish wild swings by two lumbering elephants. Good to see you're in good health.
Hello George, long time fan, just found your channel. It was a great fight. They both fought like they wanted it really bad, as if in a sense of desperation, all the way through the fight. A bitter, nothing held back, all out contest. Both absolutely fought to win, never stopped, never gave up, until one was knocked out. Can't do better than this.
It was amazing how much power you hit with champ!
I love George. Still upset he lost to Ali & I hadn’t been born yet.
Brilliant video George from a LONG time UK fan. Great to hear your words of wisdom on this thrilling fight.
People will not be talking about that fight in years to come.🤣
George, so glad to see you in complete control of your senses. I've followed you from your beginning, you were and are awesome. Thanks for everything. Sorry to have to say this but I lost a lot of respect for Wilder after the second fight when he blamed his loss on just about everything even accusing Fury of cheating. Then at the end of the third fight Fury went over to console Wilder but Wilder didn't want to know and ignored Fury. Not sportsmanlike at all. Keep well George, love and respect from the UK.
Thank you sir
I remember my first Foreman Grill. It was red.. ... .. But as I was cleaning it one night, I accidentally dropped it.. ... & it fell & broke.. so I went out to the store the next day, & got another one immediately. It's very effective for clean & healthy cooking.. and the best part is that it makes a perfect replacement for bbq grilling outside, so you can do that indoors, during the colder months. Thanks, George.
Well said Sir!!! Both men are the winners and history will remember them as great fighters as it will with you!
Amazing post commentary sir! It would be great to see you sit down with Teddy Atlas and talk boxing.
Big George foreman my best heavyweith of all time respect
Love you George, legend.
Tyson Fury and Wilder are no match with George Foreman, Ali, Mike Tyson, Joe Frazier and many other giants in heavy weight. Fury & Wilder fight is nothing to talk about.
How does George foreman only have 35k subs madness
Big George, maybe humble to admit it. But he would ve obliterated any of the modern day HWs in his prime. heck not even prime.
Great to see one of the all time greats looking happy and healthy.
Sounds like promotion to boxing!!!  Always good to see the big George well and healthy!!!
Not sure why George Foreman was unable to lavish praise on the actual undisputed WINNER of the fight. It was, of course, the super, the humble, the magnificent TYSON FURY!!!! This was all mealy mouthed stuff, praising them both equally. I think it's a bad show on Foreman's part. TYSON FURY is the world heavyweight champion, and he utterly deserves his win, as he is the better fighter. Three times now he has proved that! Full stop.
But how long will boxing look bright, seeing that both fighters are in their 30s? Wednesday ngt — October 13, 2021.
Can someone buy this man some sound foam please
You need a better microphone.
All right George it's great to see you and listen to your hopeful outlook on the future of heavyweight boxing!
A Legend talking about a great fight, so happy to see him healthy and seemingly happy! Hope he gets to go round and watch all these fights, and we get a chance to meet him
Lovely words George, what a legend both in and out of the ring. Good point regarding the ref, he did a superb job and made it clear from the off he wasn't tolerating any foul play. Epic fight, loved it and upmost respect to both men, we sure as hell were entertained!
What a champ, and he seems to be doing a podcast in a tunnel with pictures. Legend.
Words of wisdom from a living legend,
If mr Foreman says ,,one of best fights ever" I can only shake my head up and down
LIKES
If. ..is such  a small insignificant word, But George Foreman is spot on. Best refereeing I have ever seen.
Wow I really enjoyed listening to your take on these two boxers, and of course the referee. I’m a woman of older age and don’t normally watch boxing. But, throughout the years have watched all the great fights. All yours included sir 😁👍🏼. And I agree this was great. Modern day Great. I just wish that deontay had shaken fury’s hand at the end. I’m sure In hindsight he wishes he had. May just have Been the shock of the moment. Can’t take away the fact it was a terrific boxing match by both.
變成慈祥的老人!
Respect champ 🙏
Mr Foreman, thanks for your video. I have great respect for you and it is with great respect when I ask you if you think Fury deserves to be ranked as one of the greatest...?
Ha Haha I'm LOVING the great comending these 2 heavies I swear watching the PURE glee on his face is like watching the trilogy all over again haha an he topped it off by shouting out the REFFFF coz the man aren't shy he was on it an them!! Salute!!!!
Love this man
Thanks for your thoughts, George.  I always loved watching you, from your days in the Olympics holding an American flag, to your claiming the heavyweight championship at the age of forty, to now.
Respect!
Great fight, great speech about it by a all time great.👍👍👍
Ron and George was maybe the best heavyweight fight of all time...love you George Foreman
George Foreman I love you Brother I really do, but not a man in The World could make me love this fight. I’m a Die Hard Wilder Fan, that will always have to hear people put down Wilder for losing 2 Times to Fury and there’s nothing that I could do to help Wilder with those 2 Ugly L’s I never wanna see or even hear of this fight again
America loves George foreman 🇺🇸🗽💖💖
I loved the grill 🍖 it works awesome 👍🇺🇸
George was a force of nature in his day. An absolute monster.
Love and respect from the UK. Legend.
Great analysis. We haven't had a great championship fight like this long time. The only losers were the bettors who picked the wrong man. Well said. No leaving it to the judges we had a clear winner.
George n sugar ray Leonard, my 2 favorite boxers!
Форман лучший. Лучше Али. Лучше всех.  Надеюсь будут русский перевод его речей.
God bless you George.You are a legend forever.
Nice to see a non casual fan.That has RESECT for fighters.But of coursea fighter could.
Foreman is pure Class and Beyond Legend~
Classy as always. I watched you fight Moorer years ago, that was one of greats also. Good breakdown.
No. It was Saturday October the 12th. Not 9th. Your WRONG!!!
Damn! Didn't know the champ has youtube channel. Keep safe champ! Thank you for all the memories! 💪🏼🥊
Thank you for your thoughts Mr. Foreman, Looking Good Champ!
Well said from a Great Champion
Always humble and complimentary.  You'll forever be The Champ, Mr. Foreman.
George Foreman says something about boxing. Best listen! Great fighter in his day and a decent chap!
George has been an inspiration to so many and the way he found god and accepted his defeat by Ali is a lesson Deontey should hold close to his heart.  Thanks for the commentary and thoughts on this fight and life. I watched your comeback during the 90s and I’ll never forget the KO against Moorer.   A true legend.
Thanks, Mr. Foreman. A voice of stability in an insane world.
Love ya George!  This fight will be made into a movie!
Tyson Fury is on a much superior level. George can say that a bit more.
Good v. Evil. Good won!!!
I love a good referee too. If we had more refs like that many boxers wouldn’t be injured today.
Wow!! Amazing. That is such a selfless act, to give that level of praise. Really impressive. Glad I watched this
Wilder got skinny legs
Thank you Mr Forman. I felt that during the fight. You put it into heartfelt words. Thank you.
Thank You Champ!
Great show sir. Very interesting.🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏🇦🇺💪🗡️🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
This man's grills has made more money and professional boxing as a whole.
George is the best!!!
Damn.. Well-said, George.
Here's the Foreman-Lyle fight Foreman mentions: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PhSqgGRag_g
I love my George Foreman grill :)
This man is a legend the way he reinvented himself it’s so impressive. And from his presentation all that boxing didn’t take away  his ability to evaluate the match coming to the conclusions. George you’re awesome
George knocks them both out within 3 rounds...
George hasnt aged in 30 years,
Tired of hearing how much heart wilder had. What he didn't have was boxing skills, a hard jaw and respect for the winner.   Lololol
All the the best to you, George. Great to hear your take and thank you for the content.
The greatest fights were when the greatest was fighting.
George for president. I love you Mr. Foreman.
George foreman the champ has spoken respect 👍
Love you George, but disagree on one thing.  Great to see your respect for both champions., but we'll never put aside your great fights and those of past boxing greats you mentioned.  Wilder and Fury are just adding to the rich history,
I grew up watching George boxing. He had amazing fights. When men were real men. George is not only an amazing human being, but one of the best heavyweights ever. Keep doing your thing George. We love you man.
WWE
1 man was counted 14 seconds , given a nappy time , and get up when he was ready , the other man pretended to be hurt and stumbled to the canvas LOLOL!!
Sending Light to you and your family!!
Champ you’re a professional please get a good microphone
George I’m excited to discover you have a channel. I always enjoy hearing what you have to say. Just a small suggestion, get a descent microphone for your videos. I look forward to seeing more from your channel.
George is so classy. My dad always tells me about the time he met George Foreman at a Wendy's drive through a couple decades ago.
So if Fury was to retire then what other heavyweight can beat Wilder? 🤔
Big George, all the way big George, one tough man!
We love you, Champ!
Im glad Wilder wasn't harmed after that massive beating he took. MAN he took a pounding. Also that shot Fury took to the head to get knocked down was so hard, you could see Fury's skin move like a wave down the entire length of his body... from a punch to the head??? Crazy fight.
So humble and kind this is a great man.
This is the best YouTube channel
And win a title in both eras
Awesome man to fight through the 70's and the 90's Awesome Brotha
I bet going to Forman’s church is outstanding.
👏🙏👊
Love you, George. But with respect, Wilder and Fury are not anywhere near your league or Ali's. I know you are a humble man, and I greatly respect you for that, but facts are facts.
I agree with George Foreman on bringing back the past. This fight was historic and we the boxing fans finally got it. We’ve been tired of the fake fights and I’m not talking about the rigged fights like GGG vs Canelo 1 or Danny Garcia vs Mauricio Herrera or in the worst Olympic robbery of all time Roy Jones Jr. vs Park Si-Hun. No, I’m talking about today’s robbery. To the fans.  Mayweather vs McGregor, then Evander Holyfield vs MMA guy, or Old Mike Tyson vs Roy Jones jr. with bar none the worst ever commentating from high as hell rappers like snoop dog. All this garbage opened the doors for Jake Paul to actually compete on live tv. And boxing has dramatically lost its viewers to MMA because Dana White is on fire with his organization. Almost all my friends are ordering those fights and we are making bets.  Aside from this incredible fight, Fury/Wilder, Boxing hasn’t been deserving of our $ or viewership.  I truly hope that changes.  I miss the good ol’days of great pugilism.  George, keep saying what your saying. We need a new era of boxing.  All respect brother  ✊  -Fight Fan
That was the best video, thank you George. Much appreciated to hear from such a living legend.
Well Said Mr. Foreman!!!   And.... I would also Add ' The Real Deal" Evander Holyfield!
I hope Fury and Wilder see this
George would have knocked them both out...back in the day.
George Foreman, a Minister and such a Gentleman. A lovely man and good to see him again.  God Bless you George.
Don't think either of these guys would stand a chance against Foreman in his prime.
I bet even now Foreman could kick all of our asses
I don't consider Deontay Wilder a great fighter, he's average, not even in the category of Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, Riddick Bowie, the Klitchko brothers etc. I like Tyson Fury, he seems a humble individual but I definitely want to see him face stiffer opposition like the aforementioned boxers did in their era, not taking anything away from the man though. Having said all that, BIg George looks good and can still throw bombs like he did back in the day. Well done champ!
Would have been fun to see Foreman v wilder in George prime👍
Champ, you are a class act! I hope to one day meet you!
Who am I to comment on this man’s you tube feed? (I do have a couple of his grills by the way) I was going to comment on other boxers who could challenge for such accolades, but I am not worthy. You can only be the best of your era! _Ge.Fo_ had that position in his era! (Though I recall he had more than one era!)
Respect ! I consider you greater than ali ! Many blessings bro ! God keep you in his mercy
Love you champ, always good to hear your boxing wisdom! Time for George to reclaim his title lmaoo
George needs a microphone 🎙️
You heard it from Big George Foreman 👍💪👊
Referee was horrible
Get This man in E Sports Boxing.....legend
Rest in peace Mohammed Ali.I really think he wouldve enjoyed that fight.Gone too soon. :(
George is such a class act.
Ironically the cameraman needs a softbox.
I would like to see big George vs Iron Mike on triller that would be a good match up.
You sure are looking good champ.
We are all in some kind of fight in life. Dont play dirty, and get back up when you are knocked down!
George - you are such a humble champion, but rest assured the world will NEVER (EVER) stop talking about the golden era of boxing, ie: Ali, Foreman, Frasier, Norton, Shavers, Lyle, Terrell and maybe Holmes.    Following on from the above there was Tyson and that was about it..never been anything decent since Tyson.
George is my Favorite Champ..Class Act.. would have loved to spent a Day just talking about life with that Great Man..
George is the grandfather of drip.  The first with a grill. Joke!   Loved the fight. Fury is awesome. Humble pie for Wilder.
George Foreman just proved he's one of the all time great human beings. Huge heart. Generous spirit. Thank you for the beautiful commentary and helping us ALL understand the importance of this fight.
I see that Big George Foreman has a YouTube channel. I click subscribe.
Big George!!!!
Thank YOU Champ!
Respect to the hardest puncher of all time...Great to see and hear from you in 2021.take care and be safe
A sore loser that shows no class or respect and makes umpteen different excuses, while blaming everyone else but himself is not a great fighter.   Being beat up for two 12 round matches and being torn apart for a 3rd 11round match ending in a KO is not a great performance.   I wont entertain this sort of false humility in the feeble attempt to overlook and ignore Wilders disgusting display of poor sportsmanship and character.   Tyson Fury made this trilogy fight great.   Wilder was just the one trick pony punching bag that showed up to make Tyson Fury look good.
Boxing won, we all won! 💪🏽👍🏽 I really hope Wilder can come back.  I really hope Tyson Fury more success.   ♥️💯
Great words big George!
Great content and video quality, but you need a sound man or a lapel mic that is properly placed.  Too much echo.
What’s that painting in the back?
Pure Class
You YouTubing Big Geeorge.  So awesome that I found you. George "Dont Follow A Puncher" Foreman.
thank you big George 🤗
"it was something out of the past"  - yes sir! I felt like i was back in the 70s
Great commentary! Tyson and Wilder was an exciting fight and will be remembered in years to come. George Foreman has a cheeky smile and at his age also has terrific buttocks, he was also a very tough hard hitting boxer. Fury is creating excitement in boxing and is a real force of nature.
Awesome George!
Get the gloves on George….. I miss those days.
I’m proud to own one of his grills.
Love you George. You were a solid member of the greatest group of heavyweights that ever lived. Ali, Frazier, Foreman, Norton, Shavers, Quarry, Chuvalo and the list goes on. True 15 round Champions.
Brilliant,great accurate summing up of one of greatest Boxing matches of the 21st Century
God bless champ... wonderful to see you.
Much love to the champ but please have someone help you buy a cheap mic! Doesn’t have to be fancy! Good luck!
This guy is a treasure, what an inspiration
Neither fighter would have survived two rounds with the younger George or five rounds with older.  I feel privileged to have watched the sport during the 70s, when being the heavyweight champion was a monumental achievement and  fighters actually possessed skills.
You could have whupped 'em both Big George.
Big George, is good looking, a real Gentleman 👍👍👍
you are a legend george a true giant of tbe sport thanks for your message
This guy would had knocked both of those guys out in his prime
We love you man !
That highly questionable referee came along at the last minute, and replaced a referee who was just fine, and that referee took '15 seconds to get to 8' when Fury was down for the count - "HHHHHMMMMM" 🤔
It's privilege to see The Legend  himself here on youtube
Wr love you George
i  am  a young man with a boxing /  JKD / Wado Ryu backkgrond and George Foreman scares the shit out of me,.
Thanks for posting Champ! It was an honor to see you fight
"Boxing's easy when you have a jab." - Big George Foreman
Even though there was a winner you can still say there was no loser. It even rivalled your own great fight, it was a pleasure to watch.
SUBSCRIBED MY DUDE... SUBBED
Will Deontay become a preacher one day, and completely change his world view like big George? 🤔
Brilliant George.  Great to see you and looking healthy and good... God Bless
George one of the Greats!
Big George! You are the man!!
Man I remember being a kid in the early 2000s and he was still looking relatively young. Still does here compared to even older folks but man time is flying
"Who were the losers ? "      George Foreman - "No One"    💕  Great words from the Champ   🤗🤗🥊🥊
A true living lengend of heavyweight boxing ; we love you George 🥰🙏🙏
Gotta get better microphones and minimize the echo, George
You are a legend! Much love from Uruguay!
Would Fury have been able to beat Foreman when Foreman was in his prime?🤔 I’d put money on a Foreman in that matchup.
Fury v wilder, Fury is the camps so his name goes first
Big George is looking good.  If only George was younger again... what a fight Tyson Fury vs George Foreman would be.
Looking and sounding great, George!
I don’t think anybody really wants to watch boxing. I think they just wanted to see Wilder get his ass kicked
Great commentary, George.  Glad you are doing well.  God bless you and your family...👍
AMAZING MAN AND FIGHTER
Respect to a true gent..  Mr G Foreman..
Beautiful words champ 🙌🏽
Can't wait to see more vids from you Mr Foreman! subscribed
Just watched your fight with Luis Pires, which I'd never seen before. Wow, that guy had a chin, and seemed to have more success than both Norton & Frazier against you. God bless you Champ.
George Foreman is adorable.Hey George ! I did the live broadcast of your fight with Michel Moorer for the peruvian TV. What a right hand ! It was a great moment of boxing history. My best wishes for you.
Love you so much, big wise man.
Wow what an accolade to Fury and Wilder! Nice one George! Respect to you !
Mention great heavyweight champions-----Include Big George!!
Hello George! Man, I will never forget watching your fights against Mohammad Ali for the first time. The image of you landing heavy shots on his body while he was leaning against the ropes is forever printed in my mind.
DO YOU THINK THAT WILDER WEIGHING 40 POUNDS LESS WAS A FAIR FIGHT?  I THINK FURY SHOULD FIGHT SOMEONE THAT WEIGHS AS MUCH AS HE DOES. THIS WOULD DRAW A BIG GATE, AND BOTH WOULD GET A MUCH LARGER PAYDAY.
Love ya George! What a true Gentleman; what a true Legend!  Fury & Wilder put on 3 great fights that make their names worthy of using in the same sentence as Ali, Foreman & Frazer; all of whom I was lucky enough to watch on TV when I was kid!🥊😎
needs a Mic. if you already have one, it needs to be adjusted.
How have I missed this channel?
уважение этому человеку
Nice message champ but it’s sad because not just you but many other champions have forgotten the part about sportsmanship plus you also forgot the part where you take your loss like a man not like a crybaby sore looser. Boxing is not a one side color and regardless of color or race when you show true sportsmanship and be a man when taking your wins along with your losses it speaks to the man for who he is, it is a example for today and tomorrow’s champions so as far as Deontay Wilder it doesn’t matter if he gave it his all it counted for nothing when he became a sore looser and showed no sportsmanship and I think you know something about sportsmanship and what it means to take your wins as well as your losses.   Sincerely, Dr. Peanut - Doctor, Pugilist, 3x world champion, peanut enthusiast, and co created of the great circus peanuts
Wilder should come back like Foreman did, Ali had his number like Fury has Wilders, but he can come back and break records.
George Foreman should have his own boxing show! When he talks, i listen. Period.
Please work on sound .
Living legend George Foreman
The legend 👍🏽💯💪🏽
I advise everyone to watch the Foreman v Lyle fight, every bit as good as the Furry Wilder fight.
George ! i don't know if u or Rocky Marciano had the best punch ever in boxing history ! Wilder vs Fury has a little bit like U vs Ali.U have payed the best ever strategy of your opponent using ropes and gloves .....Wilder has not enough technic for defeat a more prepared,skilled,intelligent,taller,weight contender.
He was damn noooooo Yoshua lost to Usyk daaaamn noooooo cant beeee. Wait they not all 4 same but annyway.  Ngannou stomped Miocic barbie tho.
You a real Champ! not only because of the titles but also because of the way you represent and talk about boxing. You are in a class of your own.
Legend. He should do a interview with mike Tyson
Legendary fights seem to be happening more. We also got Volkanovski vs. Ortega recently in UFC.
To think all the hard fights George went thru and still totally composmentus.. This is a real living legend. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I’ve still got that god damn grill!!
Who was the loser? No one…and Deontay Wilder.
Thanks George, great to hear from you.
💯 real talk
Generous of George to say this - as opposed to 'everything was better in my day.'
He's right in saying that it felt like the old boxing was alive in that fight. Fury brings old school style, it's remarkable really. This is generational, you can't teach that, it's in the blood.
Do they fight a 4th time ? Anyone want to see that?
Tyson Fury - making Boxing great again!
In George's ERA all boxers were men U wanted to be and look up too
Oh hi George, hope you're keeping fit and healthy champ!
so happy for george that he got to witness this fight with us. and we all knew it was a great fight, but having a legend like george say what he did really cements this as one of the greatest fights in championship history
Sorry to disagree with you George but your earar was tuff men from tuff backgrounds no wining excuses
What a fight
Well said George!
Love you George! Thanks for all the memories. Please keep posting
If George Forman says it was a great fight and you're a great boxer, then it was and you are. Good to see George looking and sounding healthy.
Mr Foreman thank you so much for your views on this fight.
Even Foreman saying the ref was great. Wilder's sore loser fans complaining he was appointed late and gave a long count. Punks
For me Big George is the greatest boxer of all time.
Brilliant
“LETS GO CHAMP”
George the man Foreman
Great video, George!
King George! Well said Sir!
George Foreman your a legend 🇦🇱🇦🇱much respect from Albania
That's the mark of a great man... Imagine that? His dream is that he loves Boxing so much, he wants to be forgotten because the future is so bright, but it'll never come true because "Heroes are always remembered and legends live forever" George, forever.
GOD BLESS YOU GEORGE.
Someone get him a mic
We love you, George.
I will never forget .down goes Frazier .down goes Frazier
Oh boy did the ref (Russell Mora) came out good after the disgrace he turned on in the Abner Mares vs. Joseph Agbeko fight.
A huge respect champ.
Wise words from a wise man. Love you Big George!
We will always hail your generation as the Greatest George , it was a great fight worthy of your generation but with a little less skill, From Liston to Ali 60s and 70s boxers were the best , remember fights like this are rare today , they were not in the 70s , and you had some of the best contenders that never won the crown too , Chuvalo , Bonevena .,Mathis, Quarry ,Norton , Machen. Lyle ,and I can bet you personally know of more that i will never have heard of , and I wish you could tell me
George - you look marvolus!!!!  Great commentary champ!
Wilder won the first fight, but Fury toyed with him the next two.
Aww we all love George Foreman.... true gentleman
Woooow.  Now i got to watch it.  Sir when you say it was good Match I got to see it now on You tuuub.
When I Watch, Yet Again Your Fight With Michael Moore; Tears Of Joy Still Overwhelm Me. Your Are An AMAZING Man!!!!
Great job George! You know what you’re talking about and you say it so clearly. Admired you since watching you back in the Olympics!!
RIGHT ON MR. FOREMAN !!
Thank you for your thought mr. George. I agree with most of what is said here. The only thing I disagree is that there is one looser. The one who didn't pay due respect to the winner. By doing that Wilder lost everything he earned during the fight.
HA! I said the same.... what a ref...... showed leadership and control.
Its impossible not to love this man!
Dear George your grill is a kitchen staple
George is such a likable person.
Exciting fight ever. Congrats fury and wilder. You’re both doing good job.
You Sir are a true legend and Gentleman. I personally think Mr Wilder struggled with the extra pounds put on for the bigger punch.. Needed an early drop of Mr Fury of which. That man can take a hit. Stammina, both wanred it  but that was it. Tyson the complete brawler hit 4 hit package in the end. Like he said if you can't knock him over then score him out.Pretty hard with his reach. IOs what boxing is about also though. Skillful movement. Great fight. The right man won.
Should Anthony Joshua take up Tyson Fury's offer of training him for his match against Usyk?
He still selling grills??
ALL time great!!
thanks big g for your comment about that match👍a word of wisdom from a boxing living legend like u surely priceless✌️
Well said big guy, now we just need Wilder to stop being a baby and accept he lost to the better man with no excuses and people might not remember him as the biggest excuse maker in HW boxing history.
Luv ya brother. But I disagree. It was sloppy. Bar room brawl with 2 guys out of shape.
great britain has always been able to fight to the death no matter what, the men are like lions.
GREAT ANALYSIS BIG GEORGE. YOU WERE MY FAVORITE FIGHTER CHAMP. I WAS AT A FEW OF YOUR COMEBACK FIGHTS. ONLY WISH TYSON HAD FOUGHT YOU. BIG GEORGE IN 3. THIS WAS A GREAT FIGHT TOO. YOU BEAT THEM BOTH BIG GEORGE!🥊🥊🥊
great George Forman
Terrible brawl between the gypsie whale and the dosser
George, I'm a huge fan of yours!  Unfortunately I only saw the end of this epic battle.  It's good to here that the officiating was quality.  I myself love boxing more the UFC right now.  However, I want to thank you for this video sir.
The Lean mean grilling machine
Wow, George Foreman looks amazing!! One of the greatest Champs ever. Bless you, Mr. Foreman.
Not one heavyweight today would get though this man in his hay day guaranteed!! Foreman was a savage, a beast, and a warrior hands down!!   Mad respect Champ, and miss your commentary you we’re definitely one of my favorites!!👊✊🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
great speech from George
Class
George it's been 65 years stop ducking me
I love you George. We were young men at the safe time with me having you by a few years. Thanks for being a gentleman.
watching this great man brought me tears of joy,all too human
Play this at 1.5 speed to sound normal
When you knocked out Moorer it brought tears of joy to my eyes for the 1 and only time during a boxing match. You are a true legend George.
Wow my favourite boxer of all time on YouTube!! Nice breakdown, I look forward to more.
What a Legend, I'm subscribing to your channel champ!

You’re the best George
Hello there George! how brilliant it is to see the great man again for his views on a great bout.
Thank you Mr. Foreman. I must say and add that you Sir always put on some very very great fights also...and you know it. Respect to you and thank you again....yes, the Ref. was On Point.
Well said George 👏
What a human being of class!  So positive ❤️, so loving, so scholarly is George!  Who do you think is more positive, Pastor George Foreman or Pastor Joel Olstein (sp.)?  Equally so!
George vs Joshua
Ali ,Mike T. and George top of the top for me ...I love his atitude what a nice guy is George Foreman and he understand box as no one else..
Love you George ...God bless you and yours!
Charles luter Johnson . George looks like he's still in his 40s . If he made a comeback in 2022 I think he would do very well !
First person I heard  to praise the ref which is due...the ref was a winner also...he was so good nobody took notice of him..the best I've seen...
What people should be talking about for years to come is Wilders fake created career the fact he fought fat zed listers and punters that had only just been knocked out or old men that were on heart meds and needed the cash... Or the knock outs when the punches never even landed.  Fury was only in the gym for 3 weeks and went stright on a 36 hour bender as soon as it was over...  The Bronze Dosser is truly just a Dosser
Looking well George, good to see
Happy to see you healthy sir
I beg to differ there was a huge sore loser WILDER he couldn't even shake Fury's hand after a third beating he lost all respect in my opinion. Poor sportsmanship period.
переведи)))
I love this man. His smile and attitude is very welcoming. I think if satan sat down with him I think George would make him change his ways. Such a humble and like-able guy. Remember kids, a big smile with a positive, that alone is a recipe for success.
A boxing match can't get any better than Fury vs Wilder 3. It was a perfect fight.
Good stuff
I was witcha until u said great ref, wit that slow azz count he came wit.
Awesomeness Champ
What a bloke. Such humanity and respect always. Love him.
When big George speaks, we listen
Just think about all the calories George has saved from the world through his innovative Foreman grill.
I'm so happy to see also George Foreman as healthy as he looks and also being such positivity speaking man, always i admires his positivity point of views to this boxing era, Infact he decided to choose positivity side of life, i have followed him for a while at least for now but i have never seen him talking negativity to other fighters and that only makes me to admire him more.
I swear big G is timeless.
Hope GF dodges the deathjabs UNlike Marvelous Marvin Hagler.
Real recognise real
Damn right & well said that man .the winner was there to be seen. The mighty tyson fury . Pure class .
Love you Big Cousin! Tell Stevie Foreman I said wassup!!!
Those colors fit you nicely, Champ. Good commentary as well.
Class act 👏🏼🍻🍻🍻 and was in some of the best fights ever .
Greatest boxing commentator of all time.
Great analysis. This was such a great fight both fighters were epic. Wilder can win a world title again, in my random fan opinion.. His right hand is so good… But Tyson is a great fighter, both are.
Lol if grandma had balls she would be grandpaw
George has looked exactly the same since like 98.
George, I don't want to ever forget about you or the era you boxed in, and you won't say it, but the truth is, at least in my opinion, the current crop of heavyweights wouldn't have lasted with you for 3 rounds when you were in your prime, and that's the truth.
Good to see George it looks like he's doing well. I always enjoyed his fights and commentary on HBO
I have to disagree with the great man about modern HW boxing , one swallow doesn't mean it's summer .
//: George, I grew up watching you big fan, would love to meet you someday 💘.
I know george forman you in your prime will beat  both of them easily. You were a beast.
Deontey already lost twice    The 3rd fight should of been like the 1st
Fury is probably the greatest heavyweight in boxing history. He's just too good.
Good to see George praising this fight but no boxer today could match the fighters of George's era.
Perfect summary from George
Big George was part of a heavyweight division we will never forget..They didn't duck each other like they do now..
Great analysis, Big George. All the best, Champ!
My man George Foreman one of the greatest United States human beings ever he's not like people today whining looking for excuse he's all man still I love you George you're the greatest Annie loves Jesus Christ and America
Hey George, about that grille I bought 20 years ago, its gone wrong, you going to send me a new one or do I have come slap you about? 🤣🤣🤣 God Bless you and your family
How have I only discovered his channel recently? This is great!
We love you champ !!!!!!!!!!! We love you so much, you’re an inspiration to us all!!!!!!!!!
Real OG ..... CHAMP🔥🔥🔥
I've always liked George Foreman; great success story.
Boxing ain't shit,  George is like a yes man, foreman on the job that will do and say what they tell him...good ole George,  yuk yuk yuk...
And our lord lifted up jesus christ the king of kings and lord of lords
Got to be the greatest boxer ever
There were no losers
By George, I think you nailed it, your a Legend, and a great Boxing analyst
Hello champ. Just wanted to say that you will always be one of the greatest George!
Hey Champ! I am glad you are still with us and have all your Faculties!!! Wish you health & happiness!
Great boxer and great grilling machines.
Goat Foreman
Great to see you champ, you are absolutely one of the greatest at least a top contender, history will tell.
Big ups to both fighters and the ref
I love George but .. how can you celebrate a trash talking bum who got owned and could not be a sportsman ... Tyson fury is the best heavyweight champion ever .. he would have beat all your ass and a great sportsman ..
The Great George...❤️❤️❤️❤️
Amen Reverend... Amen... Happy Real boxing is alive again...
Cannot remember a fight when I rooted for Foreman.  Maybe his only two fights I watched live were;: Foreman v Kirkman (my hometown hero) whom he stopped in the second round and versus my favorite of all time, Ali --- the loss called "rope a dope" which Big G also humbly refers to as "I was the dope".  But, he is my favorite human being/boxer of all time and I absolutely think he is in the conversation as the heavyweight GOAT.  He was a bad man.  He launched Frazier into space and forced Ali into a desperate strategy.  More importantly, he is a good man.
Wow, what Foreman said at the end really speaks for how humble he is and how much respect he gives to Wilder & Fury, I'm sure both of them will be honored to hear Foreman talk about them like this, getting respect like this from Foreman has to feel pretty good
Great  comment from a great fighter.   George got dehydrated in Kinshasa & folded to Muhammad Ali - the only guy who ever stopped George inside 12 rounds.   In 81 Pro fights spanning 28 years ( ! ) he won 68 of 76 by KO/TKO losing only 5 in total.  Incredible record.
I was so disappointed for Wilder.  Still a fan though. 💪🏿🥊💣
We all love you George , gentleman and humble man
🤔🤔🤔ANYMORE EXCUSES BEYONCÉ WILDER🧐🧐🧐⁉️
Much love and respect Mr. Foreman, I'm delighted to see you here.
Looking great Mr. Foreman!!  Very kind and well spoken words.  God bless you 🙏
We know who you are, Big George!
Mr. George Foreman, you are a gentleman.
Great summary. They have both added the spark back too boxing. A real fight. Power, speed, excitement, both true warriors.....
Wish he was my grandad, lovely man :)
How the hell does he only have 32k subscribers?
We can talk about you all
It was like a 90z fight pure banging hesrt
Ifs and onlys mean nothing when you've been best 3 times
It was a stug fest and fury obviously hits harder
Für mich war George Foreman der härteste Puncher aller Zeiten. Unvergessen seine Hammerschläge
Legends words much respect
A great fight AND great to see BIG GEORGE!
What’s up champ !!
Great to see George! subscribed
It would take the combined strength of both shoes men to match your legendary power punches MR Foremen you called it perfect  RESPECT TO YOU SIR
George, the GOAT
More content, George.  On all things, sir.
Thanks George.
the greatest fight of all times Ali vs Foreman
15secs to get up now?
Tough as old boots 🥾
The champ passing the torch to the new generations showing love and respect he is a class act speaking his thoughts on what a great fight is all about no doubt that was a great fight and one of the best trilogys of all times
Had the rematch with Ali happened, on American soil, Big George would have cemented his legacy as the GOAT. Look at what he did to the guys who beat Ali! He is still the greatest in my eyes, with Lennox Lewis the greatest of the recent decades. Tyson Fury may well prove to be the GOAT himself - I don't think anyone from history could have handled a 6'9 boxing, power punching, switch-hitting 'giant octopus' like him.
G Foreman is a true champ :)
Yes!!! Champ.
Your one hell of a man, and a legend. We need people like you around for as long as possible. God bless you.
Big George was a wrecking machine in his time the most feared heavyweight around.
George that was just great to hear from you! I agree, that fight was one of the best Heavyweight bouts I've seen in a very long time and both those men gave it all they had!
Sir, its not a match up, Wilder got a hiding, no contest
spot on george
Wise words!  The future is bright! Boxing is back!
George is my fav champ I wasn’t alive when you where in the game but your a inspiration keep on keeping on champ
Loved what you had to say. I was there in  person and it was a awesome fight. I'm so happy that I got a chance to be part of boxing history. Keep punching Champ!
George still has the hardest overhand in boxing history
I wonder if George ever did an interview where he was grilled? 🙄
Total respect Sir from the UK. Thought Wilder was awesome and still comfortably the 2nd best heavyweight around.
So good having a legend who knows the sport commentating, good luck!
I am one of your biggest fans since the 70's! Your input is highly appreciated, Champ!
This fight is the best promotion possible for boxing
What a great guy and spot on
Analysis from a man who knows! Thanks Champ!
Hey champ you need better sound
Love you george .
George true champ also glad to see he seems well and I would stack him against any heavyweight after his time
George, you are one of the greats. A true champ, that gave us some fantastic fights, win or lose.  I watched your career since '68. It's a rare man that can show ferocity when needed and humility when all is over. Thanks for the memories.
Love this guy !
Well spoken! 😎👍🏼
as always a tale of truth
George Foreman has not aged in the last 35 years.
I’ve got to tell you all ,  I said the same thing when I was watching this fight , this is one of the greatest heavyweight championship fights  I have ever seen , and I’ve seen a lot of them , and the Only other fight that tops this one , was  when Big George Foreman my favorite fighter of all time , knocked out Michael Moore for the heavyweight championship , at the ripe young age of 45 , I believe !!!!  that was one of the happiest moments of my life . thank you Big George !!! GOD BLESS US ALL …
Well spoken George👌🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Right on Big George Foreman. Very well said.
Always good to hear from you George!  Long time fan...
“Past come alive again“ 💯
George Foreman: Great Man ; Great Fighter.  Thank you for the excellent comments.  Cheers : FJN
I really hope Wilder will see this clip. George lost the most famous fight in history and over time came back from it a winner. Wilder fought a great fight but got beaten by the better man on the day. There’s no shame in that.
God, George Foreman. I'm always amazed by the sneaky intelligence of certain boxers. He's a guy who grew up the hard way. And he was no Angel as a very young man. But you know what? neither was Rocky Marciano; who rolled drunks in wartime England in the army waiting for D-day. The Rock got sent to Leavenworth for two years. He might have missed catching a bullet at Omaha Beach. Big George, like Marciano before him and Larry Holmes, knew the value of a dollar, and probably still had the first nickel he made. I like athletes who don't go broke, who use their athletic skills as a platform for riches beyond their sweating. Like George Foreman, Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, Oscar De La Hoya, and Billie Jean King.
Thanking you kindly George Foreman,thank you for your time n effort putting this video together.  Thank you for your tremendous contribution to World Class Heavyweight Boxing.  Yeah what an amazing fight it was  between Wilder n Fury. A classic showdown for evermore. Cheers from Australia
He makes me salivate to prepare cheeseburgers
The only losers are the ones that didn’t watch the fight yet
Big George
❤️ George Thank you
Legend  Had the privilege of watching both the Frazier demolition and the Moorer right hand 20 years apart
What a class act
I don’t hear enough people talking about how great that ref was calling this fight.  Great analysis George!
How can you not live that man. He has been the most respectful and humble champ ever. This is the the perfect role model for youth. So much more than LaBron or the other over opinionated sports figures.
George  the world loves you, champ,  but today who besides  you can do an honest tribute to a fellow champion who never got his due...the Great Charles Sonny Liston ? It would be really good if you could give your impressions on Liston as you are a boxing historian ,life time student of the sport and great champion  yourself .. something to think about ,especially since you have this channel .. .for instance, how would you rate Liston in terms of punching power , ring savvy, his left jab ?
He didn't throw a punch crash dummy no fight just hype aka james earl Jones?
George, you look terrific!  You are a true champion!!
Such class from one of the greatest champs of all time.
LETS GO BRANDON!!!
Come on Big George, not you too. Everyone has said that already. People is repeating verbatim. Nobody has an original thought about another fight. It would be refreshing to hear your own take on the fight and not the same thing I have already heard from just about everyone else. Are y’all telekinetic? Do y’all rehearse? Are y’all sharing brains? Something is up. I never seen so many people use all the same words before. Never, not even with the closest of friends. It unreal how all these people saying they exact same word and share all the same feelings about it. How do that work?
Uncle George: Who were the losers? Me: We are the losers Uncle George, because we lost you all these years since you went out of boxing, but guess what!? We are wining once again because you're back Uncle George !! Thank you so much for your channel Uncle George Eternal Legend.
I don't care if I agree with him or not, George Foreman is my favorite boxer of all time, bar none.
My personal favorite heavyweights of all time, Big George foreman of I’m gonna subscribe!!!
If a Bullfrog had wings he would not bump his A🐴every time he hopped.
Touch on those 1,000 fury chock holds and weight leaning he did to wilder's neck.
The losers were the idiots who made it a racial thing. They all missed a great sporting event. .... and yes champ you are right about the ref.
Thank you Mr George Forman, God Bless you Sir.
Much love champ 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Check George Foreman vs Ron Lyle that was and epic fight, que peleón Dios mío!!! Great job Champ ☝️🥊👍❤️
First one monster, George Foreman becomes an angel and then another, Mike Tyson becomes the wisest Man on Earth.. we certainly live in an Age of miracles
I am so happy to hear all that praise from one of my favors fighters the two times heavyweight champion George Foreman and the 1968 Olympic Champion in Mexico, so glad to see you in good health ❤️💯👍
Goerge Forman what a great champion.
Still a Wilder fan,  Wilder will win against Joshua and many others
Love the commentary George.
It would've been much better if Wilder had a trainer that would've spent one week training on keeping his hands up.. He never put his hands up, never..
I love you, George. You are my hero. Glad to see you're looking strong as ever. Thanks for your thoughts.
Well said.
George you legend! What a fight, eh? I was on the edge of my seat.
Imagine George Prime v. Fury...
George I love your grill. Wilder went out on his shield . I guess there is no blaming mark b Redland for saving him in the last fight by throwing in the towel
Big George! He's the MAN!
As great as these two men are, the big George at his prime, would have whupped both of 'em.  I am so happy to see George look healthy both mentally and physically.  Thank you for the memories George.  I hope you stay with us for a long long time.
Love George, what a class act! A great person for fighters today to emulate in and out of the ring.
It remind me of your fight with ron lye a war
Amazing fight. Shame they couldn’t couldn’t shake hands afterwards
This is what the sport needs the OG's getting into the social media scene getting these youngsters back in the gyms taking care of themselves instead of wondering what species they are. Get in the ring and you will find out.
Thank you, Champ! 🇺🇸
George  Foreman . ...  If Wilder  had used  Thomas  Hearn tapes as his  ttainer...  footwork...  Everyone  was  probably too afraid   to teach  guys  like  you  and  Wilder  footwork  George .   Even  Ali wouldn't  be able to  handle  a George  Forman  with  footwork too.  Ooh....
Giant Vs Giant that’s heavyweight boxing 🥊
Right on, Big George! We will never forget you, champ. God bless.
One thing that Forman should mention is if the lead jab is absent to set up the right cross, then its just a bar brawl, I make no apologies but all of the past great champions had a great lead jab which set up the overhand right and your opponent by the 8th to 10th round is down for the count. peace out!
George you are a classy awesome Man!!  Loved watching you fight! Rock on George!!!!
Love you George
My goodness.. so humble. Thanks Champ!
George is a true champ!
Ifs buts and maybes do not count in the fight game and every boxer knows this. I would’ve had more respect for Wilder but even now it’s excuses and blame….. Three times he’s tried and three times he failed to topple the “gypsy king”. Foreman is, was and always will be one of the most loved, well respected, genuine, Legend we all have been blessed to have witnessed his greatness.
We gotta do something about your audio king.
My favorite fighter of all time, subscribed immediately
Relevant human being!
Your name will live forever you a legend my friend
Wow.... God Bless You Sir...
Awesome boxer...Awesome human being..👉George Forman 👈
Always loved you George and always will.
You're my all time favorite Brother Foreman.
Wilder! Has the worst, most hopeless "footwork" ive ever seen in a fighter! Somebody needs to get his feet working! without footwork, you can't jab!  Can't duck & move, can't do nothing but swing wildly... sorry for the pun.
Yes. The George Channel.
Thank you for commending the referee. He deserves a belt himself. I haven't seen him work before, and he was spectacular the whole fight.
God bless you Mr Foreman! Been a fan of the boxer (and man) for yrs 🙏
BIG GEORGE is still the man. There might be a negative story out there that I've never heard about. But in my eyes this old giant is a class act.
My goodness you have a yt channel!! A real champ, hall of famer sharing his opinion with us poor mortals... Thank you champ God bless you!!
George Foreman one of the grace go to see he's still around bless him and bless his sons maybe one of these days his kin folks will get back into the boxing ring
George is a Class-Act as Always!!
God bless you.
If "if" was a fifth, we'd all be drunk. If "if" was a spliff, we'd all be high 😂😂
Love GF commentary and take on this.
The only time I was ever mad at Big George is when he obliviated my man Smokin Joe Frazier...listened to the first fight live on armed forces radio in Germany when I heard Howard Cosell describe the onslaught....But since then, I like so many other boxing fans, have come to love and respect George Foreman...A great heavyweight,  but more importantly,  he carries a big mantle of faith and patriotism....Yep, can't help but love Big George...matter of fact, I just saw his grill in walmart...I've already got a grill...But not Big George's grill....I'm going down and buy one!
My sentiments exactly! While watching one of the greatest heavyweight fights I have ever seen, I kept thinking that the referee better get a big bonus, I thought he did an amazing job keeping control of the fight!
FOREMAN MY HÉROE UNLIKE THE OTHER ONE. WITH THE. BIGGGEST MOUTH  SO CALLED LEGEND .
TRUE STORY THAT INSPIRES ME TO THIS DAY: George Foreman and I gave our testimonies at Stillwater prison in Stillwater Minnesota. He had been retired for a few years and was well over 400 lbs of blubber. The inmates were a bit restless this day. The event was held in the prison gym. The crowd kept hounding George to hit the heavy bag. It became clear they weren’t going to stop harassing him until he did. So he took his coat off, stalked the heavy bag for a few seconds and hit the bag with all his might. The bag didn’t move, then George’s arm began to shake and then his whole body of fat was shaking. The inmates were laughing at George.  Then George stepped back over to the microphone. And after he let them complete their ridicule of him, he smiled and said “you laugh today, but believe me, if God wanted to, he could even bring a washed up fighter like me to become heavy weight champion of the world again”. They laughed even harder at such a statement.  And he still delivered one of the most inspiring Christian testimonies I’ve ever heard.  We took a limo back to the airport and I asked him if he believed it was possible to become champ again. I’ll never forget what he said “I’ve learned that I can make a pact with God. If I hold up my end of the bargain, Yes, God could make me heavy weight champion of the world again someday”. He said it with conviction. But I didn’t believe him. I saw an overweight soft washed up boxer that day. He was such a beautiful person that I signed over my $1,000 speaker fee to his boys ranch for troubled kids.  A few months later the news reports came out that George Foreman was making a come back with the goal of retaking the belt - Heavyweight Champion of the World. I couldn’t believe it. I followed his progress as he kept fighting and got pretty beat up in most fights. But he never quit. And, you know the rest of the story! George became one of my heroes in sports, in life and as a strong Christian man.  John Castino
Salute to you OG.
In my opinion you would've ko'd either one of these guys George. The fights and fighters from your era were on another level and can never be compared. 👊👊
When he dies, his skull must be looked at to make helmets for amateur boxing
Thank you George
I miss your color commentary during fights
What people will remember is when one of the greatest of all time won the title, again, at age 45. Thanks for all the great boxing moments George
Long Live George....A beautiful Human
Joe Frazier would render fighters useless after one of his famous left hooks.  Both times he faced George he hit him with those left hooks and George barely blinked.  Unbelievable.  The toughest chin in the history of boxing.  And he STILL has his mind at his age!
looking great mr foreman ( champ!). hey you need a better microphone for your channel, let your fans hear your voice clearly 🤩
George has given this fight his personal approval. Tyson has bought back heavyweight boxing.
We’ll said, Sir!
George Foreman is the best.
Spoken well. Pleasure to listen to.
Thank you Mr George Foreman , for your great review of the fight.  I'm uplifted by your insight on the future of the heavyweight division, also thank you for being you. I have enjoyed you and your career . I'm 68 and have followed you ever since your great Olympic victory.  I was so happy when you came back and went a little crazy when you knocked out Moore. I wish you would of retired after that fight, oh well thanks again and God bless you and your family.
George was one of the best
I didn't know big George had a YouTube channel. Only one thing to do instantly subscribe..
who in the hell would thumb down this video? smdh
Thank you George for calling it down the middle. A great fight it was. Hats off to both men
I love you, George, you are my Papp Laszlo, I watch every day the Michael Moorer knock out, also remember when you were 7 to 1 that you don't go over seven rounds against Holyfield and you did,  I made good money..stay healthy
Love to see you sir. You remind me ali. I love you sir
George foreman please come out of retirement to fight Tyson fury!
Love ya Mr foreman! Spoken like a true gentleman and champion!
Love ya Mr. Foreman
As Big George says, it was the getting up off the canvas that enabled Fury to come back. Wilder also got up 3 times to come back. But he couldnt get up the 4th time even though he tried being 1/2 conscious. What heart Wilder had during the whole fight
Even a legend like Foreman respects this new era and some people are still sleeping on it
I thought the one with you and Ali was one of the best!  Fury was holding Wilder in a headlock too much!
God bless you and you’re family George.
With all great fights lol someone will loose...
By FAR the most insightful, perspective and respectful comments on this great fight I've seen! Outstanding take by the great George Foreman!
Why is a grill spokesperson talking about boxing ?
Sorry George, but gonna have to disagree with you here...We can never stop talking about ; Foreman, Ali and Frazier... :P
no heavyweights today can compare to this guy in his hayday or even in his comeback in his 40's they dont make boxers like those guys anymore but this is what we have to dealw ith Today and Fury is probabyl the best heavyweight
Another Legend showing respect. To think Wilder compared himself to the likes of him Ali or either Iron Mike or Fury himself. He got exposed 3 times he doesn't have the defence, Just heavy right hand *Made heavier by the metal rods in it*
Thank you Champ ...
George Forman has been my favorite boxer since his Olympic days. He definitely knows a thing or two about not giving no matter the odds. I had a rough day but hearing George this evening makes it better. God bless you George.
Love how formal he dresses.
Your fight with ron Lyle was a great fight as well. Having the heart of a Lion wins fights and makes for timeless events
If Gruden is stepping down because of the racial comment I think that is not warranted. If he had a track record for this then yes he should step down and there should be accountability such as a reprimand for his statements that he already apologized for. Even Coach Tony Dungy (ex Colts coach) expressed his forgiveness and said Gruden is not a racist because of his relationships with other black friends. Everyone no matter who it is deserves a second chance. Everyone needs forgiveness in their heart. No one is above mistakes or lude comments pending remorse. People are so anal these days no matter on what issue because of the political correct syndrome of today. I remember back when a football commentator Jimmy the Greek was chastised and forced to step down for his comment on the physical make up, athleticism, and history of very built black men and how WHITES were INFERIOR to black athletes. Was this an actual racist remark? Be honest. It may have been an unwarranted comment but not racial in my opinion and I'm not a racist. THIS WAS NOT A RACIST IDEAL OR STATEMENT! But was forced to step down anyway. It was the truth and was not "dissing" black folks about their race. It"s just that head hunters were out there wanting blood. As Dungy said, Gruden was really attacking the character of the person and not actually attacking his race but the words came out wrong and was trying to add to the hurt of the individual by attacking his race because of Gruden's anger at the time. C'mon, this is a football coach. Back in the day, they had to be tough dealing with the old pro players. Look at John Madden's behavior on the field when he was coach. He was always up and down the sideline in a rage blowing off steam. Does Gruden have a history of racism or remarks? If so, yes, I get it. Then his resignation is warranted. But as I said, everyone deserves a second chance. EVEN YOU AND ME AS A HUMAN BEING REGARDLESS OF RACE! Now if there are any other issues about his performance in coaching, then this is of a Vegas Raiders issue and not of an NFL or any other parties concern. Gruden had proved that he is capable of winning a Superbowl as he did already and other than this mistake that he is a stand up guy . Though it is taking a little while for him to rebuild, Raiders fans should be patient. Look how long it took ex Raider coach Tom Flores to win.  I am a N.O. Saints fan since they started in 1967. It took 20 years for them even to make a playoff appearance and another 20 years to win a Superbowl in which some NFL teams have not even accomplished yet. I was just happy they did it while in my lifetime and I was here to see it as it may never happen again for the rest of my life. I am grateful for that much. Of coarse I would like to see it again and it almost happened. Close but no cigar. SO, lesson in life, don't always take people literally because the same may happen to you as it probably did already. You may have said something lude about them but it was not your real intention.
Love legend for all the time.
Love you champ!!!!!
Disagree with the referee bit... He didn't let them fight on the inside at all
I just subrscribed for respect! Much love Champ!
Get a proper microphone Champ.
“Ifs and buts…candies and nuts…merry F’ing Christmas, s’ons a beeches.”
George still looks tough
Arguably one of the most brutal trilogies in modern boxing history.
When this man speaks it's best to listen
What a man. succint, eloquent and humble. much love for big George.
Looking good George
I made a lot of pancakes off of my George Foreman grill thanks George.
Wilder had really lost the previous 2 fights.  You, me, and STEVIE WONDER could all see who was going to win this fight before it happened.  Easiest be in the last 50 years.  Jeez.
Deontay was definitely the loser. He was a poor one at that. He had hateful racism in his heart before he ever entered the ring. He lost that fight as soon as he called Tyson Fury a cheater after the last match. He beat himself because he didn't want to acknowledge a white guy beat him. When he should have just treated Tyson as a man he was fighting. Deontay wasn't right in his heart and soul. That's why he wouldn't congratulate Tyson or shake his hand. If a white guy beat me in a fight i wouldn't not shake his hand. I would say good fight I'll get you next time. No malice, no hate, no racism. Just got beat this time. But then again, i believe in Jesus Christ. The Saviour of my soul. The light of the world. I'm a RED man now. I don't have any other color i claim. Only the Red blood of the Holy Lamb of Heaven.
It's incredible how clear George is still. He was in multiple absolute wars in the ring against all-time greats with a style that required him to walk through some punches, and fought at a later age than practically anyone else, but he shows none of the cognitive issues we see in most retired boxers.
I love listening to Big George but disagree with him. I watched that fight and wasn't very impressed with what I saw from either fighter. Ali, Foreman, Norton, Lyle, Holmes, Frasier, Tyson, Holyfield, and Lewis would all have their way with both of them. Neither is very skilled.
Wilder should have hired you.
Champ! Your a class act!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
God bless you George, love to hear your insightful thoughts on this great bout and it’s great to see you looking so well. Keep it up GOAT!
Somebody needed to say this and I am glad it came from the Legend himself. Much respect George
George, Your fight with Big Ron Lyle is my all time favorite fight, period!!
I congratulate both men for there performance in the ring. I pulled for wilder. He lost. I dont want to ack like grand schoolers where everyone gets a trophy and everyone wins. The ref raised one hand. One man won one man didnt. Down the rd you watch that big mouth Fury will tell you how he feels about third fight. After the fight it was only praise. I'm telling you the true Fury will come out.
You have got to be kidding 🥱
Hey champ!!
Tyson Fury was absolutely brilliant from Sheffield England SWFC Hillsborough is King 👑
Foreman is the greatest.
What does a cooking appliance entrepreneur have to do with boxing?  JK love you George, your insight, your career, and your grill!
absolutely amazing how well spoken he is after all the bouts n tussles he was in. lucky man this foreman is.
George you will always be the man let's see somebody else reclaim the championship 20 years later don't think that will ever be seen again you are a legend
Well said Champ. It was a great fight with 2 winners
Good to see George in good health,thank you for your impressions sir and greetings from Romania 🙏🏻
George Foreman = Legend
BIG GEORGE!!!
Legend ❤️
You should get a Microphone champ!! It would help the quality of your sound in your videos! Great analysis!
and if BIG GEORGE says it, I BELIEVE it.  George Foreman: probably the hardest puncher I have seen in my 73 years.  With the other "Tyson" coming in a close 2nd...
Mr George is one of the best. My dad is a big fan of yours..
George, what do you think would happen if you fought Tyson with you both in your primes?
I'd rather fight either one of them than a 40 year old Foreman.
Your my favorite boxer of all time George  .
Good thoughts Champ 🥊
Love George, what a Legend.... In my opinion both Wilder and Fury would've got destroyed by Foreman if they were around in his day.... The man was a wrecking machine 💪 If I had to name the biggest puncher in the history of the sport, I'd instantly pick George with no hesitation. Looking fit and well George👍 When's your next comeback??? Fury v Wilder 3 was a great fight, hopefully see both in more great fights with Joshua, Whyte and Usyk🤞 some interesting match ups to made. Back in the 70's the best fought the best and looking back at the fights in that era they were amazing, that's what the fans want to see these days🥊
Champion George Foreman one of the Greats in my generation loved watching these great boxers glad to see George looking great
You sir are one of the greats of all time! Loved watching you work and then a second time you did it again! And now so happy to see you doing well. Wish you all the best!
Most unbiased American I've seen
Great summary from a Great fighter , and Great Man !
Awesome to see one of the greatest ever giving his thoughts
George is a class act and is a great boxer.nothing but respect for him
I see a comeback 👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼
One of the most intelligent boxer I have ever seen. Also one of the hardest hitters I have seen. Respect to the legend no doubt.
Losers
If the dog wouldn't have stopped to take a shit he would caught the rabbit.
He was knocked out, not counted out.
God Bless you George!
Mr. Foreman, I have been following your career since your Olympic gold medal (I’m four months older than you).  Your boxing career was was incredible, your business career is stupendous, and you seem like a very nice person. Thank you for being you.
I appreciate George Foreman's humility.
Reminded be of the footage of the old Joe Louis - Abe Simon title match.  Simon keeps getting up, didn't want to quit.  Ref calls after third knockdown.  Simon protests.
Oct 9/10 2021; Tyson Fury from Britain became an American hero. (plus he can sing). Mr. Wilder lost twice that night. In the ring and after the fight(sore loser).
I'm a huge fan of your boxing as well as your grill!
We love Big Poppa George
Much love to you big George
Prime Ali would have schooled both of these the same night.
Total respect. Thank you, Mr. Foreman.
Thanks for the content, great to hear your opinion on it all, and fully agree with you! Keep it coming!
🙏🙏🙏
Keep making these fantastic videos George. You definitely know your boxing and you should. Glad to see you're doing well and we love you champ. Got a question for you champ' Who do you think is the best pound for pound boxer today?
WOW WOW WOW HELLO FROM VENEZUELA, FOREMAN BIG.  HAKUNA MATATA
The ref messed up in the 4th round with that slow count when fury was down. The commentators mention that themselves. Fury was the winner of a great fight.
Thats impressive George  when you said ,,forget abou George forman! Whish you the best And you Are the best!
The Ref was in there like he was throwing blows😃
Brother Use a wireless mike or a mike because the vocal will sound better I preach and will make a world of difference
George,  Did you not see how the Ref made the hugest mistake with counting to 10 for Tyson Fury. Am i seeing things? like wtf. People are not acknowledge this. Fine, Tyson won regardless with a ko. But that KO would of never happen if the Ref counted correctly.
Wide words Champ XXX
George Foreman one of my favorite boxers from back in the day I'm about to fire up  my George Foreman Grill hell yeah
We need to see George on Hot Boxing with Mike Tyson.
HAHA! Love to see you George! You are one of the greatest!
Love to see one of the greats of all time still involved in the great sport. And george please dont ever say you guys are fighters of the past. The greats u named plus Mike tyson will always be in our thoughts of the very best. These guys now a days are great but it's just not the same.
Big George's voice is crystal clear. Blessings. So many fighters of his era have slurred speech.
Wilder lost what could have been huge respect right across the boxing spectrum,after not shakeing Ty Fury's hand after the fight..only reason he beat him thrice and will never get a championship fight again.   So disreapectfull
Please buy a dedicated microphone
Mr. Foreman, you look like you did 20 years ago. You got to have a picture of yourself in your attic.
"Something out of the past, I was able to see", very humbling.
Excellent overview by the great man
Spot on George!
If you love boxing and you don't love Big George you got a big trouble.
George a true hero in the ring and out
George you are awesome from the beginning monster heavyweight. To returning and winning the title again. To boxing Captain Kirk to the grilling machines. I always wonder though . If as you say . If you came out of retirement years earlier if you would have fought Tyson as maybe a 34 year old that would have been a helluva fight. Also Larry Hiolmes I wonder if you fought him how that would have went, Maybe you and Larry can join the guys coming out of retirement and fight eachother ..😱
George Foreman was Wilder, against Ali. No man better suited to give both Tyson and Wilder props. What a legend! And props to the referee too
It was a great fight, George. A throw back to the 70s when I was a kid. 👍🏿
A Great champion and a gentleman. Respect to George.
"If" only Wilder had George Forman's humility & vibrance his status would be 10x as much as it is today. But as George said, "if" often detracts the reality. God bless you George & thanks for the memories.
Gotta love GF
A class act in and out of the ring thank you Mr Foreman
Thank you Sir for this video. Wise words from a member of a legendary era of boxing.
George you are a true scholar and a gentleman god bless you sir
Props to George for giving props to the ref, it was exceptional refereeing and a lesson for all refs on how to control big heavyweights.
How can you not like Foreman??
George!
What a wonderful champ you are , George.
Love ya Mr. Foreman
Top man.
God Bless George,a Gentleman and a Scholar,regards from Aleks in London!🙏
Great comments, GF!
I am a great admirer of George Foreman. He seems like such an honorable and courageous man. I wish he would head to Washington and lead our country during these very difficult days. He would win a seat in Congress in a landslide. We sure do need him IMO.
Didn’t know you had a channel George, I just had to subscribe. I’m glad you got to see the fight also in your lifetime, you are the last great of your era still with us. All the best to you good sir!
A pleasure  to hear a honest response to a great "matchup" Well said Champ.
Lovely summary well said
A living legend giving his thoughts on a legendary fight. Thanks George!
simply the best brother
Legend
Excellent
That g star raw snoop ad commercial always gets me how you say some shit like say it with your booty and try to overmasculantly compensate changing the tone after g Star raw hardcore denim 🤣
Love you George!, keep bringing the fantastic content.....but get a better mic, please
Thanks George, you’re a gentleman.
What an absolute LEGEND.. God bless you George Foreman
The legend !! Big george would destroy both Wilder and Fury easily
Praise Jesus...George Foreman looking and sounding hale and hearty..
George, you are the best!  Smart and humble!
it's soo good too see George giving his opinion, it's so treasured!
You are such a gentleman and great champ!!!
Thank you George 👏👏
It was a great fight. You the man, George.
He is waffling
George sounds kind of one sided, trying his best to favor the loser. Weird and strange the way he worded his commentary.
Very cool!
Woah you have a channel.!!! I had no idea. I gotta subscribe to a legend
I love you George , i like very mucho to see you on youtube channel!!! greets from argentina!
The fight was racist the referee should have given Detonay a chance
the fact that, at one point, there were two men in a ring fighting each other... and those two men were George Foreman and Ronny Lyle... my god man... the power inside of the ring that night is unmeasurable.
1 of my G.O.A.T.S  BIG George !
Your are the best puncher of all time you georges .👍
big love brother
Lean mean grilling machine 😂😂 sorry had to do it
Still looking mean and lean George 💪. Who's next for fury?
Respect big George from the uk!
Champ, you're worth a billion dollars, buy a decent mic!
I still miss seeing you George lots of love
Damn, Foreman is an insightful guy! Spot on commentary big man!
A true legend, and a wise man, Mr George foreman, respect ✊😔
You're grill is fantastic.. 👍
Well said George a true sportsman
I've subscribed champ but get better microphone
Allways subscribe to a legend.
Thank you George!
Well said Big George
Foreman. One of the GOAT.  Yes your fight with Lyle was one of my favourites.
💯
🇺🇸❤️🇬🇧
Well, well said Champ!
Let’s be real Foreman would wipe the floor with these HW’s lol. All time great boxer!
Georege speaks really well for all the years of blows to the head he took, thats good to see
George Forman you are a legend and one hell of a top Dog, but I always wanted to ask you why did you not have a return fight with Mohammmad Ali?
George Foreman is awesome! Such a likeable guy and one of the greatest of all time in boxing for sure
<3
The legend has spoken. 😊🙏🏻
Still the man George.
George Foreman you are a living legend, sir!!!  Thank you for everything!!!
Excellent video champ!  Praise the past and respect the present
I'm so happy to see that George is looking healthy and vibrant with no real heavy signs of CTE after such a tough boxing career in his prime and later on when he came back.
I only subscribed because I LOVE George
George made a good point about the referee. The ref. did a great job.
Great Fight George
LOVE YOU GEORGE!!! TRUE CHAMPION 🏆!!!!
miss you ali and frazier man
Great breakdown
Lookn good George.
George Foreman.....always a class act.
George would knock both Fury and Wilder out. It was a highly entertaining fight ( and trilogy one of the greatest) but they wouldnt last 2 rounds with the past Heavyweight champions like Iron Mike, Evander, Lennox , George and Ali
350k views, you still got pull champ. Keep this channel going!
From a 70 and 80s kid you a marvelous hagler we’re why I loved boxing
Since wilder lost all these black celebrities trying to pillow his lost if the outcome was different the world would of never gave tyson fury guts and glory for his lost! But since its wilder it's ok your proved yourself you have guts heart ect ect ect look tyson whooped that ass you lost it wasnt a close fight all 3 fight wasnt close.... wilder didnt even show fury his respect he just left the ring and the fans who paid to see him they lost because wilder couldn't be man enough to show fury his respect to speak to the fans who had his back since day 1 smh wilder showed us he dont care about fans or the bigger man just only when he win does he expect that love and respect ... I dont like wilder no more after this 3rd fight for these reason... if he would have been a man and showed respect and spoken to his fans to reassure them I would still be a fan but this man obviously lost alot of respect including mines. Everybody feeling sorry for him and tryna say it was a great fight!!! It was one sided all 3 times
Love you George from Iran
Wow beautiful man much respect george.
Champ
Great point about the ref, he was fantastic. Needed him for Hatton v Mayweather.
We all love you BIG GEORGE !  You have always been " THE MAN " !
Wise words there 🏃🏼‍♂️
Hi George. I am new to your channel.
Very well said Mr. Foreman. That’s a great way to look at things! Both fighters have it their all.
Looking good champ♥️♥️♥️
Wilder has shoulders like boulders, his athleticism is phenomenal, but I simply cannot relate to the man - his lack of sportsmanship seems to me to be utterly disgraceful.
With the sport of boxing being nothing more than an absolute fiasco the last couple decades, this sure is a breath of fresh air.
wilder had 3 chances ,............... he failed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHAMP!!
What a gentleman
Big George, a true Legend !
It was kinda like Ali vs Forman
love you George , your a true gentleman and an inspiration
Love U Champ 🇬🇧 You Warriors really knew how to swap leather, Fury & Wilder must have been going over your ears legends before putting on the Show
Someone get George a microphone.
Big George recognising Fury for what he has become. The next generations legend of Boxing.
George Foreman!, I love you! - You are a beautiful, grounded human being. True, Wilder is NO loser, he did very, very very well - just don't get in the ring against a barn door next time, no shame Deontay, you did yourself proud, stay safe.
George, you are a breath of fresh air.  Like stepping outside from the smoggy downtown of Los Angeles to the crisp blue sky of the Rockies.
Glad I've just found you George, love your work.
Referee with the long count
Hello Mr. George
George Forman is a living legend. Wilder has a big punch not as hard as big George . George Forman hardest puncher in history,.
George just seems like a great guy.
Fabulous to hear a fighting god provide that superb opinion of a snap shot in time. Thank you, for some of the most epic fights i have seen, and great too see the future of heavy weight boxing.
Well said
Mr forman ha you could knock em out mate . A true legend in my eyes mate.
You are the legend.
4 minutes and he didn’t say anything.
Great stuff. Bang on.. Many thanks from Cornwall UK
🇬🇧🥊
George is the man!
Hello George!! Just found your channel!! Subbed. You are one of the greatest gentlemen in the history of boxing!!
Beautifully said
Big George is a legend and one of the greatest heavyweights of all time. Nothing but respect for you champ.
The legend has spoken
Agreed, absolutely!
Like the past, so right!!!
That man is over 70 years old and looks amazing
Tell it, George!
George.. you are easily top 10 greatest of all time.. GOAT!!
"the way"
What a class act…..his commentary was spot on!
You summed this fight up so well. You seem to be doing well I’m happy to see that.
This was really nice
Recommend you get a microphone for your videos, otherwise, good video.
Dear Sir, Did you remember Giorgio Bambini? My bro worked with him. He told him that you, at the Olimpic game in the '60, gave him such an hard strike in the stomach! You leave him a sign great like a dish! Greatings from Italy. Forza George Foreman, one of my idols together with Marvin Hagler and Rocky Marciano.
I always think of George when I think how people can change. I remember the original scary, sullen George but for 40 years he has been a jovial gentleman.
Only the paid viewers of Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight were the real lovers.
George is spot on with that ref. He did an incredible job. Having a good ref is never talked about, but can really make or break a fight.
Hey George! I’ve got your roaster !
Couldn’t agree more ,!
Dude’s camera is 4K
What an accurate but at the same time generous assessment & review from a true great.  Superb - thanks!
Lovely words George!!!
Let's be 100% honest George.  I love ya but the heavyweight division died when Lennox Lewis retired with all the belts.  It's been boring and low quality ever since.  The latest Wilder/Fury fight was fun but it just shows how pathetic that division is. Still love ta George
What a lovely message
Powerful George. Top words.
Gotta love you George! Stay strong buddy.
foreman has a youtube!!!! fuck yeah i am subbed!! one of greatest fighters ever thanks for the content champ!
Focus on your preaching.
Love from Ireland George!!!
Lean mean grilling machine best move youve made....Hats off to a KO Ledgend  Forman v fury would be  very intresting fight indeed, i Honestly think you had the power and skill to keep it up .....
George Foreman you are always right on point . I think Fury did what you used to do in defense to a opponent KO punch , blocking further rallying by your opponent with your arms . I believe you could have beat Muhammad Ali in rematch ( thinking 🤔 it over ) but you had personal bigger fish to fry , became a preacher of Gods word. We will never forget how twenty some odd years later you battled your way to a title shot against Micheal Morra seized the moment to regain the title of World Heavyweight Champion . It’s great to see you on Social Media and would watch and listen 👂🏼 to what you have to say about any subject . 🕵🏻‍♂️✨✨✨✨🙏🏼🔑
THANK YOU  GEORGE  FOR YOUR WONDERFUL WORDS STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART AND FROM SUCH A GREAT MAN AS YOURSELF.YES THIS FIGHT WON'T EVER  BE FORGOTTEN  ALONG  WITH YOUR OWN AND OTHER  BOXING GIANTS OF THE PAST.
Lets go george we love you
what a man, what a gentleman.Go George
If Big George Foreman says it was as good as back in the days, then it was as good as back in the days. Period.
so nice that george takes the time and effort to get a suit on to film a youtube video for us really shows the respect he has for people
Big George is the GOAT ....When you re-watch those old  title fights you wonder how Ali even made it to the end of the fight
Thank you.
How endearing
No biases, just the truth!💪🏾
🏆 Champ your fight with Ron Lyle..absolutely classic..one of the greatest fights of all time!!
Fucking Legend talking about a Legendary fight
Big George was my hero..  getting hit by  iron arms with Anvil fists
George the Great Foreman! Nothing more to add Champ!
Love ya George
Mr. Foreman is a legandary champion, an elite athlete and a king in his sport. Best of all is his humility and grace, win or lose. Mr. Foreman, you rock and we love you!!! ❤️
Champ, Amen! 🙏🏽
Boxing is back! Thank you George for your post fight comments!
Hope all is good with you champ. Stay blessed! 🥊💯
Big  G. God bless you champ. I am a proud subscriber and looking forward to everything that posted on your channel. 🥰👍
Well said  George! That was one hell of a fight! Can’t take nothing from either one of those guys!! I would have personally liked to see them shake hands and hold eachother up after the fight. That’s just me
George is singlehandedly responsible for Smokin Joe not being able to talk and tie his shoes. Foreman beat Joe 2 times, IMO 2 of worst beatings I've ever seen. Both those fights should have been stopped, infact the second one the referee should have been arrested for Attempted Murder. Forman nor Fury had or have elite boxing skills. But no matter how good you are, when your up against a 6 foot 9 300lb man you can't reach you better bring more into that ring then boxing skill because it is almost impossible to beat a mass of man like that. I LOVE Fury, but if he's 6'2 225, Wilder is done in 3 rounds. Both guys left it in ring, but Wilder went up against a force of nature.
Well said George! You put things in the right perspective.
Thanks for your comments Mr Foreman. You are forever a champion
Great speech Mr. Foreman.
We love you George!!! ❤️👍🏻
Go get em, George! One more come back! :)
Incredible man and champ.
Love you George!!
Just had a lick of crack 👍🏻 decent
This is legendary! Thanks Mr. Foreman... For everything in your illustrious career! Now all you need is a microphone!  On another note I wish Wilder was humble enough to have you provide him with some legendary boxing guidance on how to setup power punches.
I'm so happy I paid to see that fight live. I just didn't enjoy it because I was scared of Tyson Fury losing. When he got knocked down twice then I panicked lol. Hey Champ George Foreman. We all love you
Total respect George
Coulda, Shoulda, Woulda, You Said It Big G....
Schmeling Louis painting in the background?
Beautifully put. Blessings champ 🏆  great post match analysis by a great man for a great fight. Love from the UK 🇬🇧
Even if the first match was a draw, we all saw the fight and we all know that Tyson fury should have won by points after 12 rounds... after the knock down he came back and was able to intimidate DW with his boxing...
Great to see so many views for George.  And also to hear him, in his 70s still clear as a bell, enthusiastic and generous.
Spoken with wisdom, as the patriarch of boxing.
The nicest man in boxing.
What a  puncher  in his day  only the greatest  defied him
One of the best boxers of all times and one of the best commercial actors of all times.  George Foreman you are a true champion !
If George Foreman says that, it's true. Period.
Champ! I have the most respect in the world for anyone that's willing to train for a match and leave it all in the ring.
A  Noble  and  Honerable  Man.
I'm glad the old Champ and true gentleman is around looking and sounding good.  🥊🏆🥊
Thank you George
People who are clowning Wilder didn't see it right....he dug deep and gave it his all....they both came with it.I hadn't seen a fight like that since Holyfield and Bowe and Tyson and Lewis... I wasn't even mad at spending $80.... respect to both fighters...for real.
Biiiiig Geooooorge,,,,I just subbed champ
Thank you big George..God bless you ❤️👍
Thank you Sir. I agree, no one really lost and both men secured their name in boxing history. This one will be talked about and rewatched for a long time to come. Boxing needed this.
The legend. Mr. Foreman.
Great fight best man won and the ref as you said was terrific
Yeah one of the greatest heavyweights of all time.....no doubt 'bout it
Damn, I thought he was going to give us an update on his grill.
Excellent commentary sir
George you were on another level in your prime, a bit more technical thinking and you would have been the undisputed greatest.....Know it....
George Foreman was the best commentator
George looking like he did when he was 40. Hasn't aged a bit.
Hey Champ Foreman
Hearing it come from you sir shows the magnetude of that fight! Champ To Champ 🏆
George Foreman - what a fighter, and what an eloquent man. Great video champ
My grill still works 😆😆😆
I love you George....But my heart is still in the 70's and  80's
Love you Joe your the best
For DEONTA the snowflake Wilder simps the rule is  *RULE IS 10-COUNT, NOT 10 SECONDS*   if the standing boxer doesn’t stay in their corner then the ref will pause the count to give more time to the fallen boxer as a deterrence.  Notice that it’s called the 10-count rule and not the 10-second rule. The count doesn’t have to be exactly accurate, and it almost never is.  When the count is excessively long, it’s called a slow count or a long count, but it’s not illegal because it’s up to the ref, even if it causes a lot of controversy.
I said fury was amazing 10 years ago, no one believed in him and how wrong they were.
Holding behind the head was alis trick when he robbed Frazier
I LOVE YOU GEORGE!!!! CLASSIC AND LEGENDARY MAN. GOD BLESS YOU
The hardest puncher of all time is also the classiest Heavyweight of all time         GEORGE FOREMAN
This channel is even better than Richard Dwyer!
I still use my George Foreman Grill
This man had taken part in 2 matchups with the seemingly impossible outcome (his loss against Ali and his victory against Moorer) if there is any living veteran of the sport who can breakdown a heavyweight fight perfectly it’s “Big” George Foreman
I love Big George I’d love to meet him!
That referee was ASS
Greatest sportsmen. Salute to you Sir and thank you for your years of great boxing 👏🏾. Siyabonga kakhulu
Finally youtube did a good recommended video! Big George I'm definitely subscribing! God bless good sir!
George you were one of the best to ever get in the ring the most feared boxer of all times with that great punching power, you were like the Terminator constantly stalking and walking down your opponents 💪🥊🥊
Thank you Mr. Foreman, you are a man of character and clarity.  Your insights are much appreciated.
We were so impressed by Wilders heart and determination.  He has nothing to be ashamed of.
I love you, George! I hope to be able to meet you one day. Thank you so much for this YouTube channel. I hope that you are healthy and prosperous. And, thank you for your Christian witness over the years. God bless!
Legend
That was such a set up fight
I'm sure all three men would be humbled and moved to hear your glowing testimony. You lived and battled through the greatest era of heavyweight boxers.
Respect to you champ     Keep using your YouTube
If s  and buts If Wilder has any more excuses I will implode
I always compare wilder to young Forman , to hot headed and lets he’s a emotions get the better of him also got the power of an ox . Hopefully wilder grows up, becomes more humble and comes back a more skilled and talented fighter just like Forman did .  Why isn’t this channel plasters everywhere I would love to see Forman’s takes on matches, imagine if Mike Tyson had forman on his podcast
great to see you George  i grew up watchimg you fight when i was a kid Ali Foreman Frazier Norton Cleveland Williams Ron lyle great fighters great era. you look great George a living legend boy could you bowl em over in your prime. big respect.
George Forman!...A great heavyweight!...Hardest hitter of all time!!
George is very articulate, what a wonderful way with words! Very grateful to have Mr. Foreman on Youtube sharing such great content!
How and why would you down thumb this video.
George, you’re a legend
and also the only Heavyweight trilogy with a championship on the line. So historic either way
Mr Foremqn you were one the greatest fighters who ever lived. Thank you for a wonderful summary of a great fight. I don’t believe anybody but Fury would beat Wilder
Living Legend!Greetings from Greece,we love you ✌✌
Big G one the best Heavyweight love you big George
To think that way this guy would hammer people his punch power was more that wilders I’d say. I remember how Joe Frazier and Ali fought 3 times but when foreman fought Frazier he demolished him but then still got beat by Ali.
Christ makes the difference, wonderful spirit in George Foreman, Holyfield and Fury👏🏾👏🏾
Thank you George, Nice to see u ! Keep up the good work.
LEGEND!
George in his Prime would beat them both.
I'm amazed at how well he speaks, being an older HW champion, that's not too common
I aggree word by word...great fight from the today best Heavywight Boxer in the world..1 Fury , 2 Wilder and any other comes steps behind..greatings from Germay.
You are my fav champ of all time.
George Foreman is such a class act! Thank you for your incitement. Liked and subbed
One of the all time greats inside and out of the ring
Legend
Great message George
Love big George!!
I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Foreman, his son and a CNN crew in Berlin at the Rosa Parks House exhibit.  He is one of the most "down to earth" real people that I have ever met.  I have nothing but respect and admiration for this man.  He is a true people´s champion.  Bless!
Great words George.....Tyson Fury a True Brit with True Grit....shame Wilder did not shake his hand at the end and still holds a grudge.....as he made it a great, great fight, and one that will be remembered forever.
you a great champ george
spot on Champ!
Mister Foreman - we Salute you
✊✌💪😉👍👊
I love you George, and I love your Grill. You took defeat to Ali and turned it into a positive. Much respect.
I'm half wilder's weight and have the same size legs... He got a big upper body but looks like he he skips leg day on the daily
great referee.great fight
🍀👍🍀nice analysis “CHAMP”
George foreman vs Lyle was a killer fight.   Its gone under the radar but what a fight that was
I see Mr Foreman... then click n subscribe
Living legend! Stay healthy champ!
To be fair to Russell Mora, his rep and previous fights had some shocking footage, but this fight was spot on.
funny i always thought george knocked out Moorer early with a lucky punch, its only recently i watched that fight and realized it happened in rd 10..at the age of almost forty six thats incredible, i sparred as a young guy and after 2 rds the only thing keeping my hands up was fear....
Hey George, my Foreman grill has been working great btw!
George is like a lovable uncle… who could kick your ass
You ll allways be my fav. George. No matter what comes... I got up at 3 AM with my dad to watch your fights when i was 9 years old. Your legend...
Class act and one bad mamojamo! You represent the Best of your sport and the Best of Texas!!! God bless
One of the best of all time with you and lyle thanks champ
I’d like to see George give the contestants a good grilling
Forman was the bogeyman. A monster in his prime that terrified everyone. It's amazing to see how nice he became.
George hasn't aged a bit; probably all those meals on his grill
LET’S GO BRANDON!
Wilder was loser but that's not enough, he is a bad loser. I respect Foreman but I dont fully buy this american love story.
George Foreman is such a class act
What a person . Mr foreman you are awesome
Fury  held behind the head on two knock downs
When's your next title match George? Come on man you still have one more in you surely? Live long and prosper George 👍👍
👍👍👍
We love you George Foreman !
Well said George. Subbed
You need to improve your sound with a quality 🎤  Also an armchair in a grand room so as to match your grandeur and content.  Regards
George Foreman looks real good doesn't even look like his aged.
How can you not subscribe to George Forman's Youtube channel. Criminal
Big George great fighter great business man.
George you should have trained wilder, he just isn’t a technical fighter. He’s a hay maker fighter looking for a early knockout. I would have thought wilder had COVID prior to the fight based off how tired he was going the distance. Fury beat you after recovering from COVID, wilder please don’t ask to fight this man again.
George Foreman  Is the same type of fighter like deontay Wilder  One trip pony  Maybe he might get as lucky as George Foreman and get an electric grill to his name 🤣😂😅💯
These heavyweights today are professional amateurs. They're  the worst heavyweight era of all time software boring 😴 George Foreman is the same Type of Heavyweight fighter Like this generation today They have no skills Just arm punching George got lucky during his career years facts we're just keeping it 💯.
George Foreman  groupies 😅😂🤣
We love you George no rubbish just honest 👍
It wasn't great George is clueless he was never smart still looks and talk like a dummy and because his name is  George Foreman you groupies is fooled the king Ali would have said the same thing we're saying and he proved it over the  Years we're just keeping it funky 👌 💯
Selber einer der Größten aller Zeiten! Welch Ehre diese Worte!
Hi Mr George Foreman,I am a new subscriber to your channel, about 20 years ago I stopped at a yard sale here in las Vegas Nevada and I bought a real nice boxing glove with your name on it, according to the gentleman that I bouhgt it from the glove was given to him by his father, he said that his father was the camera man for your Tv commercials at the time when you used to announce the cooking grills he said that you dedicated the boxing glove to hia father,his father name was Mike, I do still have the boxing glove,I don't know for sure if what the guy told me is real or not but let me tell you something it has your name on it antd it's all I  care, I really hope is for real,because it's a great honor for me to have a boxing glove from one of the greatest champions of all times,thanking you in advance for taking the time to read my comment God bless you.
Great opinion from the champion himself.
You are spot on George!!
your head is sexy ima big fan
This was a bullshit fight.   Wilder again played by this fool.   Fury first fight dirty, then he tamper with the glove and finally, he plays with the weight because there is no limit on heavyweights.   So a 200lb man fight a 300lb man and that is a fair fight right?  Bullshit in other weight class that is not allowed.   I saw it like another way fury cheated the people and the boxing system.   I have no respect for pussy fury he is just a better  cheater.   He is the cheater champ.
You're a legend George and a wonderful role model to young boxers everywhere. I'm sorry, but I'll always remind people of how good you were.
Class
Thanks Sir George for being a great elder statesmen and speaking facts
Man, white guy shools black guy in boxing. Thats it. That is true.
Great to See u Champ! I recently Found your Channel!
George is right, this was an old time boxing match - great, and a credit to both fighters. All the best to George Forman who is a member of the "Proper Fighters Clb"
George Foreman, you are the best fighter-boxer of our time. May God come with you! And those who hope in Got, will their wings like eagles, will floy and not get tired, will go and not get tired💪🔥 Neither some kind of aluminum Tyson, and even more so Ali are match for you with all due respect to then, it is.
Boxing, the noble art.Two wariors but only one was gentleman.
BIG George Foreman!  He would have slammed both men
Well said champ. I've been so lucky to live and have seen your biggest fights ......... Live long and prosper
You Legend!
Thank you  George! You're a credit to humanity,; such a classy man and one of the greatest. Huge respect to you sir.
Agreed
Appreciate having George, the legend, giving his thoughts. Go, Champ.
Right on Champ, you nailed it, the heavyweights are back......
A legend saying he is happy his name isnt the one being said because two men are the owners of the present again, double the legend
Hey Deontay: Big George is more humble and an outstanding boxing hero over you. TILL THIS DAY!
Love you champ! Looking good. It’s cool to see a legend like you giving credit to the newer guys.
Great to hear your thoughts, champ. We're lucky to have you. Who better to speak of the present champions than a champion of champions, a man cemented in history.
Absolute legend
George before the dasmascan experience was a bad unlikable dude, and because of that he became a sporting and human role model gor everyone. A man. A great man with dignity and no pride.
I thought that Joshua vs Klitschko was a great title fight, Holmes vs Norton, Ali vs Frazier as well.  Fury vs Wilder was a very entertaining fight and also one of the best title matches of all time.  Thanks George, you look great in your young old age sir.
George you are my best champ.
Pure class as ever . One of the greatest OAT
I agree completely with him.
Hat to the wisdom and professionalism.
This is big coming from the one of men involved in the greatest sporting events.
Well said
Great message George.   Deontay needed this  :)
Thank you champ ...it's always good to see you..you represent black excellence to me.
He sure is humble - one of the greatest boxers of all time and worth more than $300,000,000,000.

This legend of a guy has a record of 81 fights with 76 wins. From 1990 to 2000 he fought ten fights when he was in his forties vs much younger opponents and STILL won seven of those fights. Those were the three losses he had after being completely past his prime out of a total of 5 losses in his life-time, he was FIFTY in his last fight. Let that sink in. #BigGeorgeForeman <3
There’s no person alive or gone to have the perspective of George Foreman he’s been on both sides of this fight and has become a greater man since and now to pass the torch from Ali,Foreman and the legends that came before to Fury and Wilder the greatest of today and definitely in line with all greats thanks George you are a great man 🤙
A great champion, wise words.
I remember him for his bad steak grills
Those were the best days in boxing.
I always enjoy hearing from Big George.
Always good to listen to George Foreman!
Such a great personality Big George!
Mr.big george...always looking lovely😎
They talk about wilders power as if Foreman never existed haha I’m 49 and I remember how hard this legend hit his opponents and it made wilders power look like a flyweight
Ain't nothin' like hearin' it from someone who knows - thanks George and greetings from Australia.
That was beautiful
The Champ❤️🥊
absolute stud!
Great to see you again Champ!  I had 5 George Foreman Grills but I've moved 5 times.  I don't know where they are.
❤️
Legend
Foreman v Lyle 1976......stone cold classic
Your the man uncle George
What a great and positive message. Class in and outside of the ring!
what an amazing man. Hats off to his knowledge and greatness of the sport, simply a legend.
I met mr foreman once. What a huge man. He shook my hand and ive never seen such massive hands. Respect to you sir
every time i use my George Foreman slow cooker i think about when he knocked out Moorer
Great to hear George give his  view on the boxing match.No one was a lower great to see a great  fight at last. No running  around the ring for a points win.God  bless  George  Foreman I still  watch your fights on you tube.
Tyson fury fan but you big george foreman will forever be my favorite  ^_^
Wilder will retire soon unless he humbles himself
Total BS . Never saw so many missed , looping punches and easy one punch 'knock downs' but masons expect him to sell the fight other wise he wouldnt get all those endorsements
IF my grandma had wheels she'd be a car 😎
What a champ you are too ❤️
Nice summation Padre.  Called as it was - crikey mate you must know a thing or two about boxing.  Cheers brother from was down under. doc
Legend
Yeah, reff was great too and fir me too the best reff what I ever seen
Always enjoy George's commentating and analysis. Thank you, champ!
Big love, big George.
you should have well and truly beaten ali, champ.  he took a helluva beating.
You can tell what a physical specimen Foreman is because he is still mentally sharp at his age despite taking all those blows to the head. Compare that to Ali in his later years.
After you mentioned your fight with Ron Lyle I went and found and dang you two just hammered on each other that slugfest holds up to today’s fights
Hey can u teach me your neck exercises you done
True that ref was soo good in the match.
Absolutely love every part of this video! Sent to my grandpa! Because he witnessed great fights  with Big George and Ali
Yo, george. How are all your sons, has to be confusing when giving presents out from around the christmas tree. And this one's for george.. and this one is for george. Just get em all foreman grills. Makes it easier. Glad to see you are doing good and thanks for the incite on the fight.
Wilder = no jab, no balance, no footwork.  Not last week, not ever.   This isn't hindsight... I was shouting this throughout the fight.  It was never high quality boxing.by either one. That was Usyk. So of course its major league bandwagon jumping now in full flow all the talking heads.   Wilder was a puffed up champion.  Joshua will put this version of Tyson to sleep if he has him down,
What a man gorge foreman...said it how itis an he knows 👏.....also loves his grills lol helped me hit my bodybuilding goals thank you sir
Sir you are so right when you said the past came back in heavy weight boxing
foreman greatest ever
Gotta love George's take on anything, especially boxing.
I was an ALI fan but I put my 20$ on you in "The Rumble in the Jungle". I was so sure you were gonna beat him like how you annihilated Joe.  I ended up with no school recess money for a  whole one month.  LOL
100% agree about ref. Glad somebody mentioned it, especially when it comes from a Champ.
Great recap George. Your fight against Ron Lyle is my favorite fight of all time. I was 16 years old then. Great!!!! Love you George. Stay well.
Appreciate having George, the legend, giving his thoughts. Go, Champ.
The diehards wanna see Fury v Foreman! Foreman v Wilder! Easy money on Foreman.
👏👏👏🙏🙏
The only point where I disagree with Big George is that Wilder is a two time loser last night.   He lost twice to Tyson by KO, and he lost twice last night. Once by KO, once by being a poor sport.
And? You got smashed by Muhammad Ali Next!
Let's Go Brandon
Wow George is looking his age now the last time I saw him he was commentating for showtime
The only down side is the fact that Wilder is such a shitty sportsman...  sadly will be remembered as a whiny suck hole...
Thank you for this Champ. Great point on the referee - I agree wholeheartedly. Thank you sir.
I love you Big George, is there a way u can text you?
I did not like the fight. Wilders condition was not the best. Too many not clear hittings.
your fans love you George!
Is this video from 30yrs ago? George needs to bottle his own line of Shea Butter or whatever his concoction is.
George is wrong about one thing here; We will NEVER stop talking about Big George Foreman.
Legend... thank you GF!
George is without doubt the greatest ever boxer that also sells grills
What a legend George Foreman
Imagine having one of the greats say your fight was one of the greatest of all time
The True Champion! And he has his own youtube too! I had no idea <3
George, I always thought joe Frazier was the toughest boxer. When you fought him I listened on the radio and you were knocking him down like a rag doll! Pound for pound I think you are the greatest boxer period! You are also a very smart business man. I love you George!
Oh George you got to do something about this audio situation buddy. It sounds like you are in a big empty room and it's just horrible. You need a better microphone champ. Let me know if you want me to do some research and help pick you a good one out you just need a better microphone. You sell about 10 or 20 of them grills of yours and that should cover something that is an improvement. It don't need to be $1,000 or anyting although it can be, just get something for a couple hundred bucks or so. That would at least be a good start for now. I am still subscribed though, love hearing what you have to say.
Golden words.
Appreciate having George, the legend, giving his thoughts. Go, Champ.
George, you are such a gentleman ! I have respected you for years .. you’ve set so many amazing positive examples of how to live life ! God bless you .. 🙏
We’re never gonna take out those great names George foreman
Thank you CHAMP!
Propers..Foreman Sir...thank you for your analysis..hope you do more in the future Brother.
Well said George about the ref
Your the best George 🥊🥊
How Amazing is George Foreman? There will never be another like him
I had no idea the champ had a YouTube channel, the quickest i've ever hit that subscribe button. 🖖🗽
We'll never stop talking about you champ, you will live forever in our minds. My 2 sons will learn of all the greats when they're old enough, you are among them. Can't wait to show him the Foreman/Lyle fight!
And so many thanks to you sir.
We rap about george in Shannon Briggs latest music video Briggavell!
126 Idiots downvoted this post from an absolute legend.
George Foreman on trending! We made a music video available on Shannon Briggs channel LET'S GO CHAMP, the music video is called "BRIGGAVELL"
Still the champ, Big George Foreman.
After this I am sorry I missed the fight coming from George Forman.
Good on you George , glad it made you smile
Foreman he is one of the few  most humble boxer in history ,
Ya gotta love big George!
We Love you George Champion forever GOD BLESS YOU🙏
Great to have a living legend continue in the sport he loves!! Great break down, great analysis, just great!!  Much appreciation to the Champ George Foreman!!
How dare you get a youtube channel without telling me!
George!!!!!!
God bless all
How would you compare with the Thrilla in Manila?
Foreman 💯💯💯💯👌🏼🥇🏆
Man, I love George Foreman. When of the best moments in boxing was Big George making a come back and ALL of the sports analysts and talk show hosts laughing, "Oh come on George you too old". The night Big George knocked the living shit outta Michael Moorer, each and every one of those fools had to go back and swallow every word.....
Better microphones please!
cant agree with u champ, ill i see is the death rattle of the heavyweight division. zero good fights in the future. its very disheartening that these guys had to fight 3 times.
Fighting George Foreman eloquently breaking down these fights is a treasure for the younger generation of people like myself. Thank you very much for your wisdom George, God bless you!
Brilliant George!
But what if fury had been knocked down again? What would have happened I wonder?
You are an American treasure. Thank You, George!
hello champ
Yo, someone on his family help him with his sound mixing or get him a mic with nosie cancellation
"Big"George Foreman💪
Thanks Champ
I don’t know you.  But we all feel we do.  You were a rare kind.  Tough strong talented and most important  endlessly  youthful and willing to grow and reflect and learn.   And I will always remember you came back to become a middle aged world champion Again !!!! I was younger but soooo excited watching who appeared to be the underdog. Bust  back in !!as if from a time machine !!!!!    It was soooo exciting to see   And also  a Buisness man and a good man and a spiritual man      Thank got that George foreman visited us and is still here !!!!!!!!!!!       One of my inspirations. And I’m not a boxer.    I’m a Dr
Great champion, better man.
Need some sound suppression in that studio, Mr. Foreman. ECCCCCHHHHOOOOO!
George well said by a man who knows the greatest ever who ended his battle with it is finished
Maybe best champ ever.
Love you Big George!
What a man George foreman is
Thank you George for everything you will always be in my top 5 greats  God bless love
the Boss....George you are a stud for life....
🔥❤🔥
Great Champion you are Mr.Foreman ,one of the few Goats and still so humble ...i wish you good health and long life it is honour to have you here...
He should fight Tyson now
💯💯💯💯
Great breakdown big George.  Thankyou for sharing your knowledge and experience with us all with your channel . God bless u and the family George thankyou .
True legend! Always love ya champ! God bless you
I think Usyk is the best !
Amo seus grill
The lean, mean, fat grilling machine!🥊
True champ Forman one of the greatest
When I saw deontay how did get tired in round 7 It did remind me of you Mr foreman against Ali
Let's send George a lapel mic.
Had no idea big George had a yt channel, great to hear your voice again champ
Well said champ. IMO, big George in his prime beats them both..
So wise.. So real
Hello Big George.. nice to see you here..
👏🏻❤️👏🏻 Thank you sir👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Sorry champ but there was a loser, a sore loser at that. Fury is a true and humble Champion 🏆. Wilders legacy will forever be of a great k.o. artist, but a sore loser.
There will never be another George Foreman, amazing boxer, more feared than any other heavyweight.  Few boxers could withstand the beating that George dished out, thank you George Foreman for giving us some of the greatest matches of all time!
I recently posted that single word in response to a comment online: "If".  My Father used to say, "If if's and and's were pots and pans, the World would be a kitchen."
👐🏾👐🏾👐🏾How are you doing king? You're still looking good sir, much respect for you🤫
Why doesn't anyone ask how fury put on another 30 pounds which is beyond normal the only way PEDs both fights fury used PEDS and maybe both used but fury used better or his body did better taking them genetics.
The legend has spoken. Thank you sir! ✌🏻
This is my dad too.  At least in my head.
Take a look at Foreman v Holyfield for heart and drama. Fury and Wilder were excellent, but George was one of the greatest for me.
Only the great George Foreman acknowledges the THREE men in the ring! True champ!
Your Fight with Ron Lyle was spectacular and this fight reminded me of it Champ. Good review.
I love this guy. George Foreman, Mike Tyson, and Tyson Fury are my favorite boxers.
I got respect and love for you MR. Foreman, but honestly I think boxing does NOT have a bright future, at least not in this division. I guess to be fair, we've(Us 50+year olds)seen the best of the best, so naturally NOTHING can compare. It's like music, we've seen the greats of the 60's-80's, today is NOT in the same league! I haven't actually watched a boxing match in over 20 years, I'm biased because I miss the power of Foreman, the speed of Sugar, the blows of Hearns, the beast of Hagler, the awe of Ali and the destruction from Mike Tyson.
You've gotta love George! You'd never guess he was a killer in the ring, cause he's so mellow now. Such a humble guy, with all that he's accomplished.
Great George foreman!! Very correct sir, a great fight for sure!
So nice to see him wearing a tie and suit for a YouTube video! Just get him to wear a microphone in order to get the echo out of this video!
george Foreman = LEGEND
Brilliant 🥊🥊👍🏼 God Bless George ✝️❤️
yeah the IF about the switching referees and how referee isnt counting Fury laying on the canvass. The referree didnt start the 10 second couting right away. just like the fighters prepare the organization of employees working that night was suppose to be following those strict protocols. ughh its always that Mr Foreman. well see. I agree its everyones experience.
I had to go watch that George Foreman vs Ron Lyle fight. And you were right! That was probably the first epic heavyweight bout. With multiple knockdown. Where both men had to dig deep,, and be determined to get the W. And the winner The G.O.A.T. The A.T.G.  George Foreman! Man that was an awesome fight Fury vs Wilder took a page from. Y'alls book. Shout from OGDEN, I was told you worked with Job Cores out here. And, I saw the picture, where you once ate dinner at Thiokol were my grandfather was the manager. Up in Ogden canyon. I love my Goerge Foreman grill ! From one George to another. Thank you. Great critique Champ.   If you Loved Fury vs Wilder 3, and you want to see more. Watch Foreman vs Lyle full fight. It's the exact same fight. But George got it done quicker. https://youtu.be/l8AVcEyyMco
Appreciate having George, the legend, giving his thoughts. Go, Champ.
nice one
George looks and sounds great. Doesn't seem like boxing damaged his body and mind like a lot of guys from his era.
George. Just wanted to say, you look so young. Still have a baby face. So congrats to you also. It was a great fight, Wilder is still my champion. George you are too wise. Godbless Legend.
Living legend GEORGE FOREMAN one of the greatest to ever do it. ✌✌💪💪
I agree with you!  But as soon as wilder opens his mouth I lost my respect for him as a person, not as a fighter. We need to remember the referee! We will never stop talking about you and all the other great fighter- but yes especially Fury not as his best adjust and took wilder clean out! Respect for wilders effort and heart but he might think if breland haven’t stopped it last, he could have been ruined for life. And a fight so hard, might give you issues 15 years ahead.  But a brilliant fight wilder as his best and fury not as good as he used to be. Yet Fury was the last man standing! And here we go again! The first accusations from wilder came! And I can’t respect him as a person but as a fighter!  Fury has it all- graze and skills beyond everyone else but USYK is perhaps the best boxer- roll the dice- Amazing
So nice to see George delivering his thoughts on this great fight.
What honer from t h i s champion. God bless you george
I don't know if I can forget about Ali) esp with political stances he took for righteousness) big George, were you the oldest boxing champ?) the new thing now is mma?) boxing too slow)
George, your fight with Ron Lyle was unbelievable
nice to see the a box legend  post fight comments
Yo this video shouldn't have any thumbs down damn hi haters.
Foreman would kill any current heavyweight in 3 rounds.
It was a great fight with great heart given by both fighters. Wilder was outweighed by almost 40 pounds and 2  inches of height. Two knock downs by each fighter ,this was a reminder of the great heavyweight fights of the past that seemed to fade away in the modern era.  The Gypsy King  won but Wilder can hold his head up high
The legendary king George foreman!  10.11.2021
I wanted Wilder to win the match.
3:33 yes well said!
One of the baddest man, the most brutal power puncher of all time giving his respect to the new generation, a true champion George Foreman
When George speaks I listen, he is a great man and a true legend
It was like the past coming alive. Thank you George for all the great fights you gave us. I watch Foreman fights to this day and if I am still alive in 30 years I will watch the Wilder V Fury trilogy again. All 3 fights were special.
Gorge it is nice to have u in YouTube champ
Champ don't underestimate the subtle brilliance of the Kronk Gym and the late Manny.  Tyson has that connection and so does Lennox Lewis. You can see the Kronk influence the way Tyson fights.  Deontay needed to talk to you champ. About the right hand.  The mental aspect. This fight deontay was not fighting Tyson. He was fighting himself. Much love to you Champ. You know when ever I see that clip of Ali lighting the olympic torch. Shaking with parkinsonism. I inevitably notice that my RIGHT arm is shaking too.  I have that same parkinsonism. I am on the same path as wilfredo benitez. Quadriplegia. No regrets. I was born to fight. 😃.
The fight was amazing, the Premium, the build up, the story,the fight...both teams made history
IF my auntie had a set of balls, she would be my uncle. much love and respect to you Mr Foreman. God bless you 🙏
Brilliant stuff george, what a great message. True champion. I kinda hope Deontay trains and betters his boxing all around, and starts taking on other challengers and continuing to win. Because, he showed a lot of heart in that match, and sometimes a guy just has your number, but that doesn't mean you can't be amazing and show the world what you are made of. And I'd really like him to do that. I've been scouring for a good take on how to categorise the fight and I think you got it right, one of the best heavyweight title fights of all time. It was something special. It was as special as fury getting up in the first match, the fact both guys were exchanging like they were was out of this world. Great commentary from a true legend
A great fighter, a great champion and a great man..huge respect for the one and only BIG George Foreman!.
Well said by the living legend  Champ Goerge Forman ! 🥊✝️
Mr Foreman thanks for this. Please upgrade your microphone. for 200$ you can get a proper mic.
Spit it out Geogre lol 😂
I'm still mad how you called the Hopkins vs Trinidad fight.
I believe George Foreman is the only fighter in boxing history who could have had a close fight with Tyson Fury ... if only someone could invent the time machine. He is a real champion forever. It's nice to see him still in good health, coz he was too good to lose it in the ring.
This is becoming my favorite channel. If you can bring other boxers for podcasts I will literally scream. Try to get a soundman to set you up with better acoustics though.
Amen to that mr foreman
Much respect to the champ!
We will never stop talking about The Great George Foreman
No it wasn’t, these fighters were sloppy and under conditioned
Beautifully said!
Does this champ ever age? Looking great sir.
It was a great fight George,both men gave it there all !!But Mr Foreman ,when I seek inspiration as a 63 year old ,some days struggling to find a reason to continue ,I watch your fight with Michael Moorer and it keeps me wanting to maintain the rage for life !!Dont be too modest mate ,you have spanned many eras of boxing and that fight with Ron Lyle was something else !!!
If wilder had the same gloves
I strongly disagree champ wilder lost clearly
Thanks Champ ! You remain the biggest Big George !
Awesome!
Love ya Big George but you need a sound guy
I'm glad GF still speaks so fluently. He is still articulate, unlike a lot of the boxing beasts from his era!
Well said big George
Well said legend
Nothing but love for George...
Fury would beat any other title holders ever, can box really well, punch hard take heavy shots rarely gets cut bad, fury gets up, bottom line is wilder cannot beat fury under any circumstance
Always a class act, big George!!!
GOD BLESS YOU MR FOREMAN
well said George you always had a way with words
What a Legend and humble man god bless you champ
Foreman for ever 👍👍👍
The audience won on this fight
Love you Big George.  You look so good after all these years!  Much love from the great State of Connecticut..!
God bless you, Champ. We love you.
WE LOVE YOU GEORGE! FOREVER AND EVER
So good to hear! Thanks for sharing.
Such a classy champion, and one of the all time greats. Thank you George!

Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die.  This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true:  Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said,  "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery  already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said  "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying,  thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten  Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or  guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not  God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son  to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that,  while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the  dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who  confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do  that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a  wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God  will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Tyson fury king of the ring.👊
I still can't believe you got KO by Ali. You know the truth better than anyone else I hope one day you will share it with us.
Thank you George, Boxing needed that speech you just gave from one of the few remaining Legends.  It’s now official, Fury vs Wilder 3 is a “Modern Day Classic”.
George - You Are My Favorite Boxer of All Times. Love Champ.  What a Fight it was!!!
Wilder won  Count tell whas fake reffery too late count look good
Can you fix my grill?
Well said Sir, well said. Respect
The ultimate insight to the fight. Greatest of  respect,thank you so much George Foreman ❤️
Love this guy
brillant comment MR FOREMAN  !!!!  Thank you.
When are the Refs going to start calling punches to the back of the head which by the rules are illegal. Wilder landed a back of the head punch on his supposed 2nd knockdown in what was a great fight to watch and appreciate,
What a humble man
Amen. A true preacherman of boxing!!!
The George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine.
Big George is like the grandpa we all wish we had.
Big George, was one hell of a puncher himself. His punches to your head would sprang your ankles.  Although it was a great fight nothing compares to the fights of your era Big George. Those were the best days in boxing.
Much respect to you sir
What a legend 🥊
Hell ya big George hope to see you back more and inevitably growing this channel. I think I can speak for many of us long time fans we all really miss your joyous insightful energy on the call ringside of the big fights.  Hell even the sound of your voice was assuring on fight night.
Excellent commentary
We hear you, CHAMP!👌🏼
Diesen sympathischen Menschen möchte ich sehr gerne mal kennenlernen. Ich bin ein großer Box Fan und habe viele Kämpfe gesehen, ich hätte gerne mal ein Autogramm von ihn
A humble man, something modern society needs to learn.
Well said George forman you are also one of the greats ever
The best referees...really??...cmon now...referee didn't do his job correctly...Fury was knocked out...how would u feel...10 seconds..is 10 seconds..not 20
Holy cow , I’m in tears listing to this. What a man and what high praise
Big heart Geroge talking like the legend he is
George Foreman grill sucks!
Thanks champ! Nice to see you looking so good.
Back in the day this guy would punch you in the head so hard even your feet would hurt.
George Foreman, do you realize that you are loved by the world?
And that's from an all-time great. Respect to Big George!
👏👏👏
Very well said George
George and Ron's fight was streets ahead of Fury/Wilder 3.
Surely Wilder is the hardest ONE punch knockout artist
BIG GEORGE
Love this channel. Thank you Champ!
Brilliant! Well said every single word there George! FURY is unbelievable especially given where he's been rock bottom mental health issues, suicidal and 8 stone over weight to come back on just 6 months to step back in the ring and WIN and then to have a Trilogy like this and be the Best boxer of our modern Era is just even more AMAZING!  I was saying after the fight this reminded me of Foreman Vs Ali, Ali Frazier and those types of fights!  This is definitely the Best fight of the last 20 years at heavyweight NON STOP heavy punches I've never seen so many HEAVY punches in one fight in my life or from history that's on film that I can remember that lasted that long and that they kept fighting.. I thought it was amazing and Fury is a proper Old School English Boxer and Showed not only his Skills Superior power and boxing skills (even though it want his best performance he's ever had it had the heart) and He ALSO showed the pure Class and respect that the spirit deserves after the fight. Wilder was an embarrassing disgrace post fight. But having said that the fight itself was the stuff of Legend like you say George this will be spoken about now as one of those Great bouts like you were involved in.  Makes me proud to be an Englishman. Fury is a proper throw back old school Fighter and Boxer. All heart, never give up for ANYTHING! Great stuff! I hope he doesn't have a crash MENTALLY after this given the depression etc he suffers with it never goes away and is a daily battle that's what made this such an amazing History making bout! Cheers for the great upload George and Thanks for ALL YOUR GREAT fights in the past! You're an absolute Legend! Cheers from London England 👍❤️💪👊😎🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🙏
Beautifully stated. Class...👌
I love how he gave the ref his props as well
Good talk Champ!
Man happy to see the champ healthy. Great analysis of the fight George you will always be a champion. Wish you nothing but the best.🔥🔥🔥
Mr.Foreman! Greetings from Russia!
George Foreman, you are my favorite Fighter of all time. I will never forget you waving the American Flag in Mexico City. I was a George Foreman fan from that moment on and you my man are a great man in and out of the Ring. I was 12 years old in 1968 and have been a fan since. God Bless.
Glad to see ur still healthy and articulate Big George Foreman  !
True even mike tyson vs buster douglas. Buster almost lost barely made it back up during a 9 count before winning in the end.
What a man Big George is! Respect to the legend!
Only 2 or 3 men in their prime could beat this weekends Tyson Fury, and one of them is the immortal Big George Foreman.
Reverend George Foreman you’re such a humble human being. God bless you and your family!
I always loved watching George Foreman fight and he is a successful Champion Heavyweight Fighter, Entrepreneur, TV star. Honest and straight up real Man. Great pro opinion.
Why didn't I know you had a YouTube Channel?!
Great video from the legend. Such a charming dude.  Mr Foreman, may I suggest having a quality microphone closer to you, to offset the echo.  Sound deadening materials help also. Great idea to have your own show, that allows to speak on what you want. So many fans admire you, and enjoy your content. God bless you champ.
George you should start training again and go fight Holyfield or Jake Paul?
George would have ko'd Wilder but  not so sure about Fury.
Glad to know that Big Goerge have a yt channel
What a good and humble man. Passing the touch and so gracious without bringing the light onto himself, as many do. Thanks George!
George, you would have dropped both of them on the same night in a combined 5 rounds!  You were the strongest puncher of all time and you had a granite chin!
You are the man God Bless You Champ!
So glad and HAPPY to see Big George Foreman still involved in some capacity in boxing.  I sure miss him as a commentator, and this is the next big thing.  Thank you, Champ!  God Speed!
Fury it's like a newer version of George foreman...😄
Well said champ. 👏🏻
A strangely vague response to the fight. Let's get real: Fury destroyed Wilder.
We love and respect you champ! God bless George Foreman
I disagree with his take on the ref .
George changed my life. I will never ever forget the first time I used the George Foreman 25800 Grill, total game changer.
what a great message and homage to these 2 champions.  God bless.
Big George...i once interviewed you early in your comeback in Shreveport or Ruston, the old memory aint what it was. I was a sports writer then and what I do remember is an excellent and humorous interview and i thank you for ALL the memories you gave us all
This is one thing MMA lacks, you on't see the legends in the audience or making commentary videos. Everyone from the past of boxing lifts up the current fighters and it's great to see....
GEORGE IS THE GREATEST
love you George!
Champ and please revise about your fight with Muhammad Ali. Make a video about that.
Get yourself an audio engineer George.
DAMN... I just figured it out now that Champ have a YouTube channel. Anyway all the best champ. May God Bless you and all.
Pity we couldnt have a george foreman as president or leader, we need these personalities to speak for us, not liars and weak men like trump
Best to you and yours Big George!
George you are the past, present and future! No one will ever match your record of being a two time heavy weight champion of the world, reclaiming your second title at the age you did! Yes it was a great match in this current era but you have fought in the golden age and then came back years later to do it all over again. No one can or will ever match that. Your character speaks volumes! Much love to you sir!
Just two words to describe Big George..........PURE CLASS!
i really could listen to you all day would love to shake this GENTLEMANS hand one day he is one of my all time favorites
Yeah and so long as the ref counts correct . All’s good.
Spot on George. Heavyweight boxing was the winner on Saturday.
The only winner here is the George Foreman grill.
Well said George! Big fan of your signature grill range 🥊🥩
👍 George 👍
Well Said Champ
George is a great boxer as well as a great human.god bless you.
The thing I like the most about Big George, is his humility. He took the time to praise all his opponents, win, lose or draw. Takes a strong man to build another man up, at the possible expense of his own legacy (in the public’s opinion).
Mr.George is so humble -he gained so much wisdom as he got older. I cried like a babe when he regained the title . He certainly has had a profound spiritual journey. May the rest of us be so fortunate and resolute in striving to do that.
Love ya George! ♡
One of the best heavy weights fights.thanks George 🥊🥊
Great insights Champ!
Thanks champ well said
F you foreman. We wont stop talking about Ali. Thats where you f*cked up
But Big George, just as o many, you did not mention ROCKY MARCIANO!.
George Foreman with his presidential speech.....LOL Love you George, great champ
love you george! your the man!! god bless you!!
Sir, with respect I must say that in your day you would have eaten these two fighters for breakfast as would Ali and Frazier in their day .
Jah bless you, Big George. Good to see you again.
I disagree with George Foreman, I don't think it was a great fight. I thaught it was a pretty mediocre fight. George is over playing it.
When you speak, you inspire me to be a better person.
Mr.foreman....the best fight i have ever seen was you and holyfield go the distance.....you 2 exchanged some devastating shots....truely incredible....and to think you were 10 to 15 years older than him....thank you sir.....may god be with you
George was a mean fighter! Ferocious
A living legend and nailed every point, beautiful stuff thank you George
Big respect to Mr George Foreman. Absolute Champion. Any fighter of any era would be scared coming up against this legend in his prime.
In all the great fighters, someone has to lose!! What a great statement for the Wilder's fans!
Foreman's a class act
The last of the great heavyweights from the 1970s  . .
George Foreman the Legend….
Hello George.                         Im british and old enough to remember your fights, you Sir to me are the 2nd best heavyweight that I can say Ive followed in my lifetime, you knocked down Frazier and Norton, and you only lost to Ali because he tired you out, he may for all we know talked you to sleep during that historic fight, but besides that, you returned to claim back the title twenty years or so later.  Regarding this fight Wilder was at his best in this fight compaired to the first two ,  but still got beaten up, a very enjoyable fight a credit to Boxing, but please man show respect to Fury.
So good to see George in good health, love you champ and God bless
all love to you George The greatest Foreman
Keep on rocking, George !
You were Wrong George, Wilder Lost.        Just admit it , don't disguise it and put your preacher/ political twist on it.
Despise most celebrities these days.. love this man though.
Respect goes to George Foreman, when he fought Ali, George never lane on Ali or tried to choke Ali or put his forearm on Ali head and tried to sneak in big uppercuts. George Foreman is a true champion, so fury you might wanna take notes home boy 💪🏿💯💖
Many thanks Sir...forever you are our Champion. Be blessed
Great analysis. I admire you.
Good words from Mr Foreman.
Big George you should be challenging Tyson Fury and am sure  would come out victorious. Tyson boxing style is perfect for Big George.
hi Big George !
all ALI fans love  and respect Foreman
George will be remembered forever, as will all the greats. Wilder will be forgotten.
George should make another come back. He'd knock out either one of these two bums even at this age.
Been waiting for Big George's input on how the fight played out.
I wont argue with George Foreman. If he says it was a classic its a classic. He is one man that would know what a heavyweight  slug-fest is ,
George Forman a true gentleman.
Hi Sir. You are amazing!!!   BTW: You need the mic nearer to you. Try a longer cable or a Lav mic.
Perfectly said.
I just got your outdoor grill.  Best grill ever!!!
This fight was definitely rigged by the boxing powers that be! And to compare to any of Ali's fight's is str8 blasphemy!! This was horrible boxing by both fighters. The main reason? Conditioning...they were both in lousy shape. Fury esthetically, and Wilder with his poor breath control, and boxing fundamentals. Antonio Tarver said it best, "Wilder had no fundamentals at all." Wilder should not be sanctioned by ANY boxing authority, until he finds out what's WRONG with his lungs. He may have blood clots like Chris Bosh had. Which I do NOT wish on anybody, but judging from Wilder's inability to breath properly, something, really bad, was severely compromising his air flow in all 3 fights, and this last match cemented it!! Fans deserved them both in their best shape, and for 3 fights straight, they showed up in poor condition. There were like 6 knockdowns...sloppy, non-cerebral boxing from 2 ego's that are not nearly as good as they, or the world portends them to be. Shame on Boxing as a sport for purporting this farce as #championship caliber boxing #IT WAS NOT!!! #They both looked like 2 ham and eggers at tops maybe that's about it!!!
Foreman - Best Boxer Ever!!
Big George Foreman the original bad ass respect
George Knows Very Clever Man Still not used his Grill Yet purchased it over 10 years ago
The punching preacher god bless
chills at the end
I’ve still got my Foreman grill.
Thank you CHAMP!
George Foreman is right on all points! 100 percent!
Wilders the current Foreman and Fury's the current Ali.
Big George is forever a boxing legend.
No ifs and no buts fury won and wilder is already coming up with accusations about fury.fury and wilder could have ten fights and fury would win all ten💯🤜🤛good content george 👊
George Foreman we can never take your name out of boxing fortunately :D  Legend!🔥
Forman still going strong
Need to fix your sound champ. Wilder was shot, went for the hail Mary wasn't conditioned for anything over 4 rounds lol
Legend 💪🥊🔝
Respect to you George great summary!!
Looking good George love from Scotland
Nobody was counted out, though
Gorgeous
Sugar Hill Steward will get the credit for Tyson Fury's win. However, it was not for John Fury, TF would have lost that fight.   If JF had not insisted that TF come back to London to relearn his elusiveness and awkwardness, TF would not have used both that style and the Kronk style in the fight against Wilder. If TF solely relied on the guidance from Hill Steward, he would have lost in the 5th round. After all, he was knocked down twice by Wilder because he was too one-dimensional.   Once TF applied the elusiveness and other Team Fury boxing skills,he was able to escape from Wilder's clutches to eventually get the victory.
Great video big George!
George is the man. much respect.
Subbing
love ya George
I am so glad to see and hear you always. You inspire me to train! Thank you.
lovely george, thank you
Great words, from a great Champ.
Thank You Champion for telling it like it is.  You are at the pinnacle, in the house of many great Gladiators.
Cool! Just discovered you have a channel big George! Keep them coming 🥊
Rubbish. The drama was great, 5 knockdown but the  quality of boxing not that great as the fights in the past with Ali, Norton, Frazier. Hollyfield and Mike Tyson and George Forman of course. The Fury Wilder fight to use a footballing metaphor  was like a great Championship match not Premier league.George is being too magnanimous and generous.
You gotta love George! (And he was a hard-ass puncher too)
You got my vote big George, any time you want to be the president of USA
George just doesn't age.
Well said champ!
Big George, Wilder fights like a granny in highhills and handbag
good to see an American showing no bias finally
Good stuff.
Love ya Big George!
I thought I was coming on here for a review about the Foreman Grill, what's all this boxing talk.
Thank you beautiful Great!! George Foreman.
Well said George.  Your a legend
Big George wears a suit just to make a video Super old School and class right there, like Uncle Junior on Sopranos.
The ref deserves a lot of credit for this great fight , his management ensured a great fight
You sounded very clear and of good sense. Perfect observation of an amazing fight and how the smart referee handled it. Well said George.
Wilder showed his lack of class on not congratulating Tyson on the win. That's twice he got knocked out and he won't give Fury the credit. No one beats Fury, but himself until he retires.
I mean, Wilder ain’t that good
Great stuff champ 👍
George, you're awesome! Great speech.
Amazing to see & hear a true Boxing 'Great' look so fit and healthy speak so eloquently at his age after all his gruelling fights.
Much love George from NZ well said 💯🥊
The fight was entertaining,  lots of drama , hard punching etc, yet IMHO Fury boxed better, and was in a better shape,  against Klitschko
Deonty Wilder is a Legend
They say nobody remembers the loser, but Wilder gave everything! In the end the winner is irrelevant, everyone won. Wilder should be proud and Fury is a heavyweight giant.
Big George !!! The Real '' Real deal ''
That was beautiful coming from such a legend. Well said Mr Foreman.
A great compliment by a living legend. Cheers George, from the UK.
If I may, I would just like to say, this was a very kind review of our recent heavyweight clash between Tyson and Deontay. George Foreman was one of the strongest, most devastating punchers in our history, he could literally fold people in two. It must have been frightening for people ringside to see, his natural, awesome power. I wouldn't mind getting George would love to be back in the day, where he was a contender, strong and fit as a flea, as they say. George was very praising and honest, but with great respect, saying it was their time now. They are the Foreman's and Ali's of our time now. Great to see the big guy looking well, giving an honest account of what happened and have enjoyed the latest, quality, heavyweight clash. Thankyou, respect everyone!
I was at your fight with JB Williamson in Galveston Texas back around late eighties. You signed my ticket after I went into your locker room at Moody center. Still have it. I’ve been a fan since the beginning.
The referee was definitely on point. 🙂
Emotional fight. Wilder vs fury was a roller-coaster. Crazy. Tyson fury is at the moment the king of boxing. Salute George foreman. 👊🤙
Awesome... brilliant comments from George
A genuine living legend. Man I bet he's got some unbelievable story's!
For a 90 yr old man he is so together, i hope he reaches his 105th birthday. Legend.
Legend
What beautiful words George. Thank you. My dad was a boxer and just loved you. Boxing is a magnificent sport which reflects our humanity in a very specific and unusual way. Best wishes. David
Get a microphone please champ
Beautiful Speech
Because of Tyson Fury's sheer size, you wonder who could have beaten him (especially now that he's a big hitter as well as a great boxer - thanks to Sugar hill), and the name that comes to mind is George Foreman. Man, he was big and scary and brutal in his youth. The way he looked at Joe Frazier before he annihilated him, terrified me as a kid.
Wow just wow ❤️
Awesome to see you on youtube Rev Foreman! You were and are a champion.  Love from taiwan
Great to hear George talk this positively about the modern boxing era. Many (pessimists) claim boxing is dead at the mo.
THE GREAT GEORGE FOREMAN LOVE AND RESPECT FROM THE UK 🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🥊❤️❤️❤️
We never stop talking about Ali and the greats from your area.
Both fighters have reached iconic status. On the greatest fights of all time
It's true. That was a good fight. But the world miss great personalities, which be great outside the ring too. Who know's Tyson Fury ore Deontay Wilder in Germany, only Boxing-Fan's. Fighters who  make headlines with Doping will be no great Fighters like Muhammad Ali ore George Foreman. That's why not look the whole world the fight, like they have done in the 70's to look fight with Muhammad Ali. The people stand up in the night to watch the fight. No one except Boxing Fan's would stand up to look Tyson Fury ore Deontay Wilder. This is the sadness of boxing in this time.
You're a legend sir  I respect you so much 💯
George Foreman is such a great person. We should be honoured that he is still walking the earth.
What a great humble man
Best commentary from a great professional. God bless you George.
Class act George, well said, a legend.
Great content… just would make sense to invest a little in a wireless mic.  Would improve the delivery of your message. Good luck champ- I’ll toon In with or without the sound improvement, however it would help so much! 100% love.
Thank's that's true.
george lookin great , keep truckin george!
Totally agree with George foreman :  both - deontay w  & Tyson fury came to fight & the winners are the fans not only in the US but around the world '  these 2 great athletes  were NOT  interested in pulling off a super boring Floyd 🤡🏃‍♀️  in the ring & win by a gifted decision by paid judges. Awesome fight 👏
I don’t think Wilder deserves as much credit for this trilogy purely because real Champions that go down in the history books as greats don’t make his level of serious excuses and accusations!  I’m sorry but Wilder is acting like a dosser not a Champion IMO.
I love foreman and the world know that he is one of the very best ever been in boxing, I love him as well because he is so humble person and he is giving a great spech about walder and fury and all we know that today boxer they can never do it the same as foreman,Ali,Frasier,....diid. Thank you champ foreman and I enjoy your spech more than the fight.
George, I've just purchased one of your grills 😄  Hope to see you added to the upcoming ESBC video game 🥊🥊
George seems to forget that Tyson Fury beat Wilder 3 x in a row 😁
Mr Foreman,Fury did not beat the count after the 2nd knockdown by Wilder.Doesn't the ref have to "pick up the count" from the official on the ring apron at the same tempo or pace given?Not just randomly make up their own count like the ref did,when Mike Tyson knocked down Buster Douglas.
Massive respect  Big George...I'm glad you lived long enough to see this fight and the current Heavyweights aswell...Wish you many more years to come and all the best buddy...A true inspiration..I watched The Rumble in the Jungle as an 11 year old boy with my Dad...God Bless you...😁😁👍👍💕💕🥊🥊🥊
Well said Captain 👍
George Foreman - a truly great man!!!
Hell yeah George!!!!!
Le plus grand poids lourd de l'histoire , big George foreman des souvenirs inoubliables
Great reff indeed mr foreman
I need to grill up some grub Champ.
When's the comeback happening George?
Fury and wilder great athletes thank Mr Forman
You're the best champ
Foreman Vs Lyle was the greatest fight in HW history. For anyone that has not seen it, go and watch it now.
Nice.
I love you George- God bless you
Always pleasant to listen to Foreman
My father knew George’s doctor and I met George years ago at a dinner. My hands are not exactly small, but when I shook hands with him, my hand disappeared! Great champion and a great man….
George I’m disappointed with your view as the greatest  You and Ali was the best followed by Frazier Ali Tyson is not a boxer Hope to God shots Leaning on his opponent  Sorry!
George foreman es uno de mis ÍDOLOS  BENDICIONES
It’s amazing to see Big George giving these guys today the credit and yet some fans refuse to give them the credit. I will show this video to anyone who things the HW landscape today is dull.
You got a spare grill for me to borrow?  ;)
Wilder power punch shot is nothing for Fury
Long live the great champion of the world forever the great George foreman
what a puncher
LEGEND. One of the GOATS.
You are a great boxer!
Far too kind and complementary big George 🇬🇧👊🏼
So glad to have you with us still to remark on momentous occasions like this. We will always appreciate what you and so many greats of yesteryear have done, and we appreciate that you so gracious give so much love and respect to the greats of today. You are a real man, a real fighter, and a real champion. We love you, George!
Sir, you are the real GOAT. You're are the only Boxer I put over Ali n Mike.
A very humble & honest man!
George is a legend. Big man took some bombs on his face and is still eloquent, sane and healthy. Must be some freak genetics!
George your a gentleman. If wilder had your class. Unfortunately he does not
Sir George Foreman you don’t need to introduce yourself
Thank you so much mister Forman for these words..  a true legend.
What a words from the legend. May god bless you and your family, Geogre!
You're the champ's Champ George God bless
Man, it's a breath of fresh air hearing George's active voice across the sport that loved him! #GeorgeForemanOG(original Giant)
Well said Mr. Foreman. On the note of Forman vs Ali or Jack Johnson and the like, I really wish someone would go through and restore and digitize all that classic fight footage and preserve all those amazing fights for all future generations to see. God bless.
Thank You Champ... Great Video!! 🙏🏽
Aight Imma say it: Geroge would have beaten both of them in his prime...
Ruiz should have had a shot at that belt not wilder wilder is weak for a heavy weight just my opinion 🤷
Pastor George you are one amazing man and I am blown away by your incredible intellect. Not just on boxing even though one may say it goes without saying. However that crisp clear analysis still comes from a man who has been there and can now make sense of it all. I salute the man you have become with that lovely smile always beaming. You are a true inspiration and a role model. Maximum Respect and God Bless and keep you. Christian Love from Cape Town - South Africa. 💖
The oldest champions of history
What a humble man
Love your grill George.
Thank you for sharing your insight on this memorable title fight, George :). While the referee did a great job with this most recent heavyweight fight as you mentioned, during your incredible slug fest with Ron Lyle, the time keeper screwed you over in Round 2! You were imposing your dominance and the bell rang with a minute remaining. That made absolutely no sense! Fortunately, you had the heart of a lion and would not be denied regardless. Keep it up and NEVER give up!
George grilling & serving the copers.
This man here is a class act . Doesn’t look like he’s aged at all in the last 25 yrs
Someone get George a microphone. Thanks for staying active Champ!
Thank you George for your in site on the wilder vs fury boxing match. Always good to see legends of the past. Much love and respect from New Zealand. GOD bless you sir.
Great job George, well said. BG George auto graghed his auto biography  for me.. Thanks again.
Except his slow ass counting
Legend. Just wanted to come here and tell Mr Foreman that. That's all.
SIR GEORGE FOREMAN
Foreman is truly a great man. A superb personality. One should take inspiration from him.
George simply one of the best!
..maybe i can adopt george foreman as my grandfather?
Wilder wasn't counted out. Just saying. Great win for Mr. Fury
NO CHAMP. FURY LOST. POLITICS KNOCKED OUT WILDER NOT FURY.
Can never put Ali and co - Out of my mind. But that was a fight for the ages.
The only thing i respectfully disagree with Mr.Foreman is the ref I think he was extremely overbearing with Fury (and i was rooting and betting with wilder) I think it was painfully obvious I was wishing Larry merchant was calling that fight so he could call this ref out like hes done many times before,but anyway I defer to the great George Foreman
Beautifully said
You got JESUS CHRIST in your corner . You will always be a WINNER. JESUS CHRIST never lost a battle and never will..
George, there needs to be more people like you in this world. It would be a better place.
🙏🙌
You had me right up to the point you called Russell Mora a good referee
One of great boxer during the eara of muhammad ali, nice to see you foreman
Thanks Champ!
My all time champ.. big George 🔥❤️
Wilder got ripped off again! That last minute replacement Referee did not initiate the 10-Second Count correctly against Tyson Fury when he was down... https://youtu.be/xTgu98jk2wU
Hey Bigg George i fought Amateur boxing for the Aztlan Boxing club in the early 80's on A St Hayward Calif, Dick Sadler came by a few times, is it true that in Hayward Calif in the 70's or late 60's some dude cut you off in his car when you were in a Crosswalk near A St, and then you went walking around looking for that perp, George those were the days when you wore Tank Tops and had a badd Temper.
Champ! You should do more videos like this!  This is amazing.
respect George...always been humble...one of the greatest heavy wieghts of all time./
GF& Holifield match was a great fight. your smile  at the end of the match was unforgettable
1.5x speed
Big George (Голям Георги), compliments from Bulgaria! A lot of exhibitions around right now... You got the spirits, always! Just wondering if you are thinking about the  Holifield - Forman 2  TOO  :)   Be healthy!
you are right, but these boxers never match  era of yours.  at that time your body language, boxing skills were superior to these boxers.
George, your opinion is so beautiful. One truth is Tyson Fury hasn´t rival at this age but everybody know Fury hadn't could win you much less to Muhhammad. Greets from Colombia
Spoken like a real sportsman should George! from someone who has 'been there, done that,'  pity Wilder did not respond that way to Tyson's after match acknowledgement, but we can give him the benefit of the doubt on that one. One would have to be in his shoes, and it may just have been heat of the moment comment. Two worthwhile opponents who gave their best and, gave their audience their money's worth. An exhibition of real warriors getting knocked down, but getting back up, and into battle.
Big George Foreman, the legend. 🥊
Rumble in the jungle is the best fight ever. Ali is the G.O.A.T and Foreman is 2nd best heavyweight boxer of all time. Who is third? Maybe Liston, Louis or Dempsey? I say Liston.
Big brother george  If you maybe agree deontays skill as in his style of fighting especialy in his ability to be deffensive. Cost him the fight..otherwise deontay is a great fighter. But without the right skills and deffence .it is a problem  And tyson fury has that he has skill and good deffence. Maybe deontay should of been humble  enough and accept floyd mayweathers help
Maybe Jack Johnson or our MOST BELOVED BIG BROTHER GEORGE in their prime could have dropped Tyson Fury. George - THE GOAT.
just subscribed. teach General Foreman!!!!
George, you are a great person! Class act. Some of these guys today could take some pointers from you on how to speak and conduct themselves.
You’re a living legend George, and I couldn’t agree with you more! There was no loser in this fight, and even in defeat Wilder can hold his head high! Congratulations to both world class athletes !! ❤️
tyson fury  he's the greatest ever fact in any era respect to ali tyson etc but he's the greatest he's so big 6'9, nearly 300 pounds, moves like a lightweight, ko anyone , unmatched IQ, unlimited gas tank ! He's the greatest ever fact 👑🐐🙌🏻🔥
Respect to the world champ Mr. George Foreman
Subscribing just because it’s Big George. What a great American and a great role model!
George you have always been a man of character, integrity, class, and one of the greatest heavy weight boxers ever.   A true champion.  Thank you for your example of how to conduct oneself as a champion in and out of the ring and as a good man.
Good job, well said
You are a damn fine man George!
Foreman went from one of the scariest dudes ever, to a kindly grandfather or uncle.  Legend.
George, the acoustics in your room are not good for shooting videos. It sounds like you are talking in a box. You are a legend and deserve better!
That's why I still use my Forman grill, cause when it's all said and done you get some good shit!!!!
yes George, you are right, but you were counted out fast against Ali, Fury got a count that would have been 18 if your ref did the counting.
George, look up Gene Kim n Chuck missler on YouTube
🔥
Well said CHAMP, Mr. GEORGE FOREMAN.
Foreman's wrists were as thick as my ankles and I think his forearms were as thick as my calves. That's insane. So him punching someone would be like me stomping someone.
Proud to have seen your comeback George, and I can tell you 1 thing any of these heavyweights should pray for.   Is to talk, and look as good as you when they are 72, you have lived a great life, and us Texans are still amazed, and proud of all your accomplishments.  That being said last nights main event was the best we’ve seen in a very long time.  Thanks again CHAMP!!
:) 👍
Leave it to classy George to be straight up and concise.
Amen, George! Flash back to the late 70's and 80's! Great fight!
Great one absolutely it was worth the ppv and I'm not surprise Icknown about Tyson Fury since 2015. He got that Mohammad Ali shuffling in him and that head movement quick feet and that Jabs jabs moving around the ring. Wilder needed to have a big. Name trainer in his corner correctly that's the only mistake to help him on that game plan of dealing with a quick hands and moving his feet like the late great Ali Tyson got his style down pack a completely a showmanship yes💯 everyone taught I was crazy when I strsted talk about him on his first fight and didn't know about him I told them this man got it you got to see him move for a big man and his quick hands and feet. well that whole barber shop and nail salon finally know of him on fight number 2 and see the mauling of a beating he put on wilder then on fight 3 that punch from the left graze to the upper right down on the chin put him to sleep Gypsy is seriously a great boxer oh yeah that punch was pretty a shot lights out😴🤕😲😂💯✌🏾
I’ll never forget Foreman vs Lyle, one of the best fights off all time. Period. Fury vs Wilder 3 is right up there with it. Both fights were EPIC! One was not hyped at all, hardly. And it was FREE! The other, heavily hyped and cost a lot on ppv. Worth every penny, btw. Almost feel like I should send a little extra lol But what really matters is that both of those fights were epic displays of all four warriors putting it all on the line to just outlast their opponent. Both were unbelievable examples of heart, stamina, courage and a never quit attitude displayed by all involved. The result was 2 fights that I will certainly never forget and will be forever enshrined in boxing lore.
Hey George! How ya' doin'.
If the judge didn't count  to 10 in 15 seconds.
My main critique of wilder is he wasn’t as powerful as you big man. Always acted like the power was new.
SALUDO DE ARGENTINA BIG CAMPEÓN!
Brilliant over view!!! your summary of this amazing moment was Spot on, you took what i felt and encapsulated, NEW SUBSCRIBER!!!
George looks phenomenal for a guy in his 70's...he should make a comeback and fight Holyfield again.
Great fight, Fury is without a doubt one of the greatest of all time and hopefully still has plenty of fights left in him. Wilder needs to keep learning the game and learn how to show class and respect when things don't go his way.
George is like his grill keep forgetting it was great in day
George, you are the best! I just turned 60 years old and I've been a fan of yours since I was a little boy. Not just a fan of your boxing skills, but of you being a quality, first class  guy.
If one of the biggest heavyweight boxers from the golden age says this is one of the best heavyweight fights ever. Then you can be sure you watched a really good fight,
Sonny Liston must have been weighing up the situation; will he get to meet his young sparing partner Foreman before he retires?
Wilder is going to feel the pain when he gets older. When you young you think you can do everything and you don't think about the future when you older. I personally have so many health problems because I abused my body when I was younger and Wilder getting hit all those big shots it's going to hurt him when he gets older.
Tell em to show the knockout George
I agree with the comments by George Foreman. The better fighter won. No excuses.
Wilder should have had his trainer(s) receive Virtual Counselling from George Foreman during his training camp. If anyone knows their way around the 1-2 its Big George Foreman.
It’s an honour listening to a living legend, one of the last of the Ali’s era
A young prime Foreman vs a young prime Tyson...who you got
i hope boxing commentators talk like you. I was a big fan of yours when you started as a pro. I was devastated when you lost to Ali. Decades later i love you more than when you still fight in the ring. Great respect on you sir.
I think Foreman is more entertaining than Ali was.  And yes! Boxing is great again. Both warriors were extraordinary.
Tyson believe God
The upmost respect to you Mr Foreman.  We loved, And love you from Detroit.
That man right  there is a world class act!!!!  Love ya champ
Great post-fight commentator.
Mr. George Foreman , Miss the days when you let it rip and lay em down on the canvass.  You are the true gladiator and we appreciated every minute of it! 💪🏿
From da Godz of a king  i know what he means
What a shame we've never seen George Foreman at his physical and tactical peak, he would have been virtually unbeatable in the 1980s if he hadn't retired for such a long time! Hail to him, what a legendary athlete and a graceful man.
Big George the best!!
I’ve admired George foreman for over 40 years People say he  lost two Mohammad Ali in zaire. But I say the heat defeated George as much is Mohammad  110 degrees with 80% humidity
Why should we listen to this schill?  He was the guy who proudly raised the flags at the olympics and said he would do it the same today.  He also endorsed Trump.  Take a hike old man!
Big George, I give you a perfect 1000 % score for your great works past and present.
We love you George!  Oh yeah, and it was a great fight between Fury and Wilder.
You've come a long long ways in your life Big George!! A true spokesman. Big George Foreman forever!
Hey George, I believe your comeback fight with Holyfield was one of your absolute best  fights, unanimously given to Holyfield. I believe you won that fight and wished there was a follow up fight. Interestingly Tyson Fury appears to have your powerful long arms combination jabs. Fury is definitely going to reign King of this division if he stays in shape because Anthony Joshua can definitely not withstand his punching jabs. 👍
Much love to you George from Amarillo Texas. I hope Mike Tyson get out there just like you did in your late 40s I adore both of you and I think it would be cool to see Mike Tyson hold the heavyweight champion belt again or the light heavyweight championship belt
George, get back in the ring and beat Fury's ass!!!
GOERGE IS STILL MY FAVORITE BOXER OF ALL TIME..... FULL OF CLASS AND BLESSED 🥊🥊
Tyson fury took out the horse hair from his gloves, you can clearly see that if you slow it down and pause the video throughout the fight, pause the fight  at 30.52 , the difference between the gloves is tremendous, You can also see his  modified gloves in the Floyd Mayweather commentary video . Open your eyes and do the research for yourself ! stop being sheep and wake up! Giving gypsies more of a bad name ! Btw he took of them gloves real fast at the end!  Everyone knows fury isnt a power puncher. Its so ironic how they are holding the glove up for the camera to see at the end while they water down the cheater. BTW a knockout in boxing is 10 seconds but thanks to the last minute replacement referee tyson was given 15. Cheating prevails in boxing still to this day 2021!
Not only was George Forman an all time great fighter.  he is also a great man ,not only a great ambassador to sport but also to the human race . If we all had his attitude the world would be a better nicer  place .
God Bless George Foreman. Great Fighter, And Even Greater Man of God and Human Being
Tyson Fury will become the greatest boxer and have the hardest punches
an easy argument can be made that Foreman is the greatest heavyweight of all time. He was whooping Ali's ass until Ali arguably cheated and rope a doped on an extremely loose rope (after which they didn't manufacture ring ropes like that anymore, so it was a fluke) and Foreman just tired himself out without Ali doing much. And then 2ndly, Foreman beat all of Ali's opponents much more convincingly than Ali, destroying guys in 1 round that actually BEAT Ali.
You are absolutely right George. The two men definitely gave this third fight their all. I think Deontay gave his best fight compared to the second time but Tyson's weight was just too much for his  skinny legs as Tyson kept pushing down on him. But that comes with the game.
Wilder should take a tip or two from the Champ how to be humble. George "the champ" Foreman one of my favorites.
Hail to King George 👍👍
George foreman sounds like a damn fool, he was fortunate to fight in an era of the greatest heavy weight champions of all time. Why would he diminish the memory of heavy weight legends. Perhaps He wants everyone to forget the ass kicking he took in his second half of boxing.
Love george!!
Hell yes
Thanks for posting content, Big George!  It's wonderful to hear a great champion giving his thoughts on his own platform/own terms.
Just found the George Foreman channel. My favorite fighter of all time. Only one thing left to do. Just SUBSCRIBED!
I mean....this guy never ages
Big respect to you George thanks for posting keep safe and well big man  👍🏻
I hope Wilder and Fury watch this video from the one and only BIG GEORGE FOREMAN
How Wilder acted during and afterwards gives deeper understanding to how Forman felt from his defeat to Ali! I don't compare this trilogy to Ali/Forman but was very entertaining! Way to go Fury, you definitely deserved to win! Respect Champ!
Thank  you Jorge we love you
foreman was a bigger puncher than that bum wilder. big george would club ya cold and make it look effortless.
even now I wouldn't want to get hit with a right hand from George Foreman
Thank you for this Champ.  It's always great to see and hear from you.  God bless.
To be fair sir ….. nothing hits harder than the George Forman grill 💰💰💰💰
Absolutely a roller coaster of emotions of a fight! Wilder went down twice, Fury went down twice in one round and a whole lot of action. The only thing I didn't like was that there was quite a bit of holding. I think fury would've won by decision too but the heart Wilder showed is legendary.
I love you Big George. We're both from Houston. I'm still upset from Ali beating you, i was 9 years old, and had a bet with my dad. I remember exactly where we were, driving down our street in our 72 Ford LTD,when i heard over the radio you getting counted out. He got lucky, but i grew to love him too when i got older. ❤️
means alot coming from George
Mr. George Foreman is a great fighter and statesman for the sport of BOXING-Kudos!
What a legend!
If they would fight more as you did with any available worthy boxers then boxing would come alive again.
All do respect Mr Forman. My hats comes off to you, but that was a horrible ref.Not only was he a last minute replacement,  but he clearly play the roll off holding Wilder back every time Fury went down. He did this to buy extra time. Wilder is not a better boxer than Fury,  but he was not on an even playing field. The first time these two met, Fury was out cold. The ref was literally screaming the count in his face begging him to wake up. 13 sec count to be exact. Why did Wilder not get the same respect. Yes he was knocked out, but give the man a chance to wake up, just like all of the chances Fury had. For the record Fury was knock out in the 3rd round of this last fight. In that case the fight should have been ended then, but no. The ref again pretended that he had to hold Wilder back, buying Fury yet again more time to wake up. The boxing world is dirty, and you know it. How much did they pay you to front for this video???
Thanks for the video champ!! Please keep making this videos for us your fans!
Great comments from a great man, thanks George from New Zealand.
George is national treasure. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with us Champ!
Thank you, George
Champ
Fantastic to see you again George!💖  Will always remember that great KO in 1994 vs Michael Moorer.👍
Agree
The golden era is over. Mr. foreman is a legend who loves boxing and is trying to save the sport. But todays boxing doesn’t come close to the old days. Wilder isn’t a boxer. He’s a one trick pony.
Good on ya George from Liverpool UK.
wow i didn't even know that those 2 idiots had another fight. so what happens next, another year and then another rematch?  used to be that the champion had to fight the next guy in line.
imagine hearing from a legend, 1 of the ATG HW fighters to talk about watching one of the greatest HW title and Trilogies of ALL TIMES .. we really witness a modern day classic 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Come on everybody give George a thumbs-up I don't know how anybody could give him a thumbs-down shame on you!
Well said George perfect analogy of the fight!
I am just too young to witness your greatness, but after saw Wilder’s performance, I do believe you have had the greatest punch power of all time
Big George please start posting regularly.... Just look at the views.... We miss your assessment of the sweet science very dearly.... Always a Champion in my mind.... HOF fighter, HOF commentator, HOF Person.... Triple Crown Champ very rare....
It's great to hear George's viewpoint. Before I saw this video, I was thinking about George vs Ron Lyle as a similar type of fight. I guess so was George.
I love you GF you are and will be the boxer of all generations.  Yes the oct 9 fight was top but top for 2021 style and will go in history as such. Forman and Ali Bobbie
A true American hero. On my bucket list to meet some day...I would be honored
george foreman, a boxing legend and hero. you are my favorite of all time ! in and out of the ring ! i got to say hello to you at a Roy Jones fight in indianapolis once. never forget it
Wtf
What.A.Fight!
Awesome video/speech Mr Foreman!!!
What a Great guy Big George turned into.   God blessed him with a miracle mind change. And his burger cooker aint bad either!
Even my 7 year old daughter knows who Big George Foreman is.
It did indeed feel good to see heavy weight boxing back again as well as it`s always good to see you George.
Love you Champ!
Love you George, your life has given me so much inspiration ! Your one of the GREATEST
Big George Forman, whether he is knocking people out, Selling you a grill, or  doing commentary,  he always does it with class!!  I bet wilder wishes he had taken his help now!! Hind sight is 20:20.. thanks for the words champ!
I love George Foreman and everything he’s done in his career, but man does he need a new microphone.
Foreman is his prime would beat both of them
And George Foreman has spoken! In my opinion, Wilder should've taken Foreman's invitation on training. That could've giving him the edge.
Well stated, accurately stated.  You are a wonderful representative of the boxing world both in front of the camera now and in the ring when you were the talk of the world of sports.
No big George. The looser is wilder and not because he lost the fight he is a looser just because he can't accept the loss and refused to show respect .
Excellent insights from Big George!
AmaziN!!!! God Bless you George! Amazing how eloquent he is. Did he write that all down or was that a freestyle??
George Foreman what do you know about Tyson Fury being knocked out in the fourth round AKHI SAID TYSON WAS KNOCKOUT IN THE FOURT ROUND AKHI is not usually a foolish man!!!   SHALOM I'm.Yahudah🕎
Beautifully said Champ!! What a humble man.
Great perspective and spot on. Salute Sir Champ.
George the gentle giant and gentleman always underated but one of best if not the best ever no question
I believe you George because you know boxing. If you were an umpire a strike would be a strike a ball a ball. Plus you know Christ knocked out the devil’s teeth.  Soon Christ will grab a bend the devil’s horns.  Keep the faith bro.
George Forman you know both those dudes are GARBAGE in the real fight game!
Looking good champ!
George foreman hits harder then fury he would of knock Wilder out easier, he also had a chin
hi george your always a legend in my heart i am from switzerland but i lived 5 years in california from 89-94 and i loved to watch your fights.. i am happy to see you still healthy and happy. cheers flavio
There is a difference in growing up big. And lifting weights
Fury just understood that wilder put on weight. Weight he is use to carrying. So fury wore him out. Then beat him up. Foreman I believe Ali did it to you. And you eventually did it to win after retirement. Just a smart fighter
It was a great fight, and Tyson Fury has made his place in history, but there are some guys from the days of old that would make him have to be even better.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I don't give a crap what big George says, he will always be in my personal top 2 favorites!
Imma have me a burger made on my GF grill.
Some of the best time me and my mother ever had was watching your bouts, Mom was one of your biggest fans, she passed in 2000. my daughter at 8 tried boxing, i told her you was also a Preacher. Boxing only lasted 3 months, Megan now 24 years of age and she is a preacher. You have made such a lmpact on my family thank you champ!!!
GF could still bring it !
Idk about yall but I want to see Wilder/Joshua. They both lost very recently. Id also like to see Tyson unify the belts but I think we all know  the way HW Boxing works w/all the politics the chance of these things are slim. I think Tyson has to fight Whyte next and im not sure if AJ/Usyk had a rematch clause and the way these boxers today take off so much time its hard to tell what will happen the next cpl yrs.
Im sorry Mr George, but very reluctantly for me, this match came up on top of your classic with Ali. When Wilder finally went down and stayed down in rd 11, your KO in the jungle flashbacked to my mind, and I was like OMG!   Thank you for frontrunning, and you lost like a champion, and everyone wanted you to beat that Michael chum when you returned. This I cannot say of Wilder.
Just imagine if foreman fought in this era. He would ko everyone except probably fury
I can still hear Michael Buffer in my head saying "BIG!  GEORGE!  FOREMAN!"   There was nothing more electrifying.
Always  loved george Forman. God bless....
Nothing but class from the wise one!!!!
George is the man. Hes truly blessed. G2G 🙌 AMEN 🙏
Greatness
After watching this I want to cook a hamburger on my George Foreman grill 😂
Deontay simply had no answer for Fury's strategy of mauling him and tiring him out with his weight.  Hard to see where Deontay goes from here.   I don't think he will want to retire after an effort like that,  but its hard to see how he gets another title shot.   At 36 years old his practical paths to regaining the title may have been cut off.
I get your point Geroge but still, Forman Ali and Frazier are the greatest.
Appreciate having George, the legend, giving his thoughts. Go, Champ.
Love you George. Your fight with Ron Lyle was one for the record book too.
George Foreman, you are one of a kind. I dont know if its actualy you that reads these comments butif so I want to say thank you for being a quality human being. Not only are you fair in your fight analysis, but I believe you are fair in life. I grew up watching you fight and then tuned into HBO to hear you, Emanuel Steward, and Howard Lederman everytime they had a show. I had the pleasure to meet Mr.Steward and Mr.Lederman at the I.B.H.O.F. and what great people they were. I never met you but my father did at Miami International Airport when he got your autograph for me. He passed away 24 years ago but I still remember so clear the day he gave it to me. It was a great day for him as he truly enjoyed listening to you talk boxing on HBO. Lastly, I wanted to say thank you for being a good role model to the many kids that need one. You are a great being in the world. Didnt know you had a Youtube channel and I am now subscribed. Take care and keep the Youtube content coming sir.
Love you George....a true legend of the sport. Glad I came across your channel...just subbed.
I mean, I didn’t think the ref was so great last night. It probably wouldn’t have made a difference, but you can’t deny how slow the counts were when Fury went down.
We love you champ.
thanks George. think I'll get that old grill back out.
Not only a great boxer. George is a great person as well. LEGEND
Fury vs Wilder IV
😎👍
That week ass of a fight.  One of them (DW) can't even fight. Call that shit like it is, the boxing game is  full of bomb ass dudes ,.... now the HW division is a white guy that supposedly be like Ali.  The slow moving targets are now the fast ...........sweet boxers? Boy I'm sure this been in the making for years.
In boxing there's always a loser so he's old ass needs to stop the  booboo DW got his ass whooped like. Fury said he was going to do
George is the man
Thank you Big George! May God continue to bless you my brave brother!
Great to hear from you Champ!
What a legend!!! Well said champ!!
Tyson Fury future Hall of Famer
Know what I hate I hate for people to allow themselves to be manipulated and used by a System now y'all walking around like y'all don't know Tyson Fury got knocked out, all the way out in the fourth round. George Foreman sitting up there like he don't know Tyson Fury got knocked out in the fourth round. I hate to see people let themselves be used and, for what against your own brother.No he knocked him out and the rep gave at 17 count how come you didn't talk about it man you just what they want you to be that's all you go ever be!!!   I'M.YAHUDAH🕎
Never praise a cheater. Tyson needs to be prosecuted for illegal activities in boxing and banned.
I love his pictures in the back
My neighbor - looking good George
I cooked my lunch on the George Foreman grill, ate it, then sat down and watched Wilder and Fury put on a great show.
Well said Champ! My household jumped to our feet when Wilder got dropped in the 11th round because we realized it was over but before then you didn't know which way it was going to go. You could see Wilder was fatigued and looking worse for wear but you cant count him out until you put him down for good and the same goes for Fury.  What a fight!!!
Should boycott american boxing 🥊🥊 there fast to call people cheats when there always fixing fights or letting people fight when test positive for drugs the ghost score cards and the  extra judge  pass score cards iffy ref point deductions for eny  other fighters that are not from America tell you if that went to points wilder would have got the win clearly ovb like first fury wilder fight . Boycott american boxing there a joke
MICHAEL N 0 seconds ago When people talk about crazy exciting fights I always tell them Foreman vs Lyle is the Gold standard! As I was watching the fight last night that’s exactly what I was thinking! This is like that Foreman vs Lyle brawl! I watch that fight every now and then and I still don’t understand how you got up so many times to win that fight big George! Not to mention that that fight would have been stopped early today! Goerge you are truly ONE OF THE GREATEST! Thank you for the memories!
Hey Champ!
Great reflection of the fight Mr. Foreman. Your one of the best ever. God bless 🙌 🙏🏼
Great Champions lives forever - well said  champ-
Totally George well said,  Wilder can hold his head up high.
We will never stop talking about You and Ali and all the greatest fighters of the past if anything we need to speak more about you all to show these young kids today what it truly takes to be great! God bless you George Forman 🙏❤
Great point about the referring
You're a true class act, George.
Fury held behind the head and was leaning on Wilder all fight 😂😂😂🤔
Very well said, subscribing Thanks champ!
George how noble of you to pass the crown on to the “new” greatest.  You may think you can hand that over and slip away... no way!! Your fights with Joe Frazier and that brutal war with Lyle were unbelievable.  That iconic fight with Ali... Comon Big George you don’t get off the hook that easy.. Man you are an inspiration to the world.  You took your licks without complaining now take your damn compliments 😊
LEGEND... and great words!!
Glad to see Big George any time💯💯💯🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Can't believe big George is talking to us on YouTube.✌
@GeorgeForman With all due respect champ, i dont see how the ref was the best at all...he seemed to be moving in favor of Fury....maybe i need to watch it again
I disagree sir.. That fight was a waste of money. Nowhere near a great fight. Wilder was extremely unimpressive seemingly because of his lack of conditioning mostly
George you will always be my favorite heavyweight fighter. You shook guys to their core with one shot.
MUCH LOVE  AND RESPECT from Japan Big Joe, What a great fight indeed.
Your one of my all time favorites champ but if wilder can't be more than a hard puncher this was going to happen.
I was saying during the fight that there were shades of Foreman v Lyle, the way they traded the initiative was something you rarely see.
Gotta love George 😊 - living LEGEND !!
Fury 3 , Wilder 0. I personally, can't respect Deontay until he can be man enough, to accept defeat, a man's character is the greatest asset .
Champ! Happy to hear you mention Ron Lyle! Very underrated fighter
A great summary !!! Well done George !!!
We Love You, George, You are one classy man and a Living Legend of this Sport we love, Like you said, just an excellent fight
Looking good george
Wow, what a great man!
Luv u, Big George. 🙏🥊❤
I'm so glad I got to watch that fight and I'm so glad a legend like George made this video.. A real passing of the torch moment 🙌
100% agree put all the shot behind it and accept fury was and is the winner   Wilder could go back to the drawing board and still get some fights  Sorry about language George Bless the legend himself And we will never put Ali and forman and fraizer and many more will always be in are minds
These two weren't as skilful as you and Alli and smoking Joe, George. Say it as it is. I wouldn't rate them. Fury hasn't got proper heavyweight skills. Mike Tyson would have knocked him out in the first bell! So is Evander Holyfield, Razor Ruddock, Riddick Bowe, even Lenox Lewis.
wilder is a bad sport
Forget greatest title match, this was one of the greatest heavyweight trilogies of ALL TIME!
One of the best ever to lace up .   Love from ireland champ champ
Cuánto gusto me da escuchar a una de las leyendas del boxeo !!!
That was such a very inspiring insight on how the story of boxing runs from the past to the present. Well said Champ George Foreman. 🥊🏆
I lost all respect for Deontay WHINER not shaking the champ's hand. That's some weak sht. POOR SPORT.
Really nice words there. Thank you big George 🙏
I love big George always happy  to hear his opinion and total none biased outlook on boxing :) One of the best to ever lace them up!
Hey Brother George thank you and all the best to you ♥️👍🏻💯
Big George even a heavy weight great on YouTube.. Keep them coming! Would love hear opinion on Canelo vs Plant Bud vs Porter.. God Bless!
As old as he looks. I still bet he could fuck me up in a boxing match.  And I'm 29 in great shape.
George morphing into Karceno
Examine Fury's second trip to the canvas in the fourth round. Pay attention the the referee's rate of counting when compared to the round timer. Fury was not standing up after 10 seconds of time had passed. Watch it for yourself.  Similar to Tyson Douglas in the 8th round February 1990
Heroes are the former heroes,like you Mr.George Foreman and your second generation.
Pity Wilder lost.I like George Foreman as a commentator but i disagree massively with him about this fight.I admit Fury has done well to show his ability on all the fights with Wilder but the decision in the first fight was correct and he could have been counted out.He made good in the second fight but in this third fight that ref allowed Fury to lean on Wilder and he shouldnt have allowed it.Splitting them up wasnt enough,he should have warned Fury but he didnt and i only saw Wilder getting tired again and getting beat.
George you are such an inspiration... you see only the courage, the talent and the determination in the boxers and you call it like it is based on those attributes.  I watched your fights as a little boy, teenager and as a grown man and I was always impressed by your ability to KO your opponents and your determination to win, never given up - you are in my books one of the best ever to lace up and step into a ring .   Congrats on your YouTube Chanel Champ.
George... you can afford a better mic...
George foreman looks real good and healthy that’s good to see
I love big George but!!!! Those knock downs by Wilder were week ass knock downs.  The knock downs by Furry were straight up hits to the jaw and temples and down goes Wilder.  The last knock out was a pacaso. Wilder once again acted like a punk . And once again hasn't spoke to the media after a huge loss.  He makes a lot of excuses.   So I am sorry Mr. Forman with all due respect sir!!!! Their were losers. It was Wilder . He was sent to the hospital and was lass seen bleeding out of his mouth again.
The most unskilled fight I have ever seen
That was a real throw back fight a real  joy to watch and I totally agree with George there were no losers last night. Tyson and Deontay cemented their place in history with one of the greatest trilogy matches of all time. The heavyweight division is looking like it did in the 70s and the fans witnessed greatness last night one the greatest fights of all time and perhaps one of the greatest heavyweight champions of all time.
nobody bangs like big george!
Tyson getting knocked down the second time was behind the head and shouldn't have counted.
You are the greatest
Great commentary by big George!
And Newwwwww Heavyweight Champion of the World - "BIG GEORGE FOREMAN!!!!!!!!"
world Legend!
Good to hear from you Champ . Lyle and you was one of the greatest fights ever. I agree the ref did a great job with the fighters.
Big George is great, I remember him not sitting down between rounds. The media making fun  of his age, until he won the belt by ko. A great champ
Love George..class act!!
your a beautiful human being George. Your words were all so true and this fight will also become historical like your generation and other. You have done so much good in your life time and your family friends and followers are very proud of you. Good on you George and I also love you 💟
George Foreman is one of the great fighters. He was good in his first career. When he came back and won the title again, he joined the great fighters, in my opinion. For me he needed to do more than he accomplished the first time and he did, showing heart, taking and delivering heavy punishment. One man knocked George out, Ali. In the rest of his fights George either won or lost, mostly winning, standing on his feet still giving his all to win. For me that makes George one of the great fighters. A great puncher, good chin, and if knocked down, he got up, every single time, but one.
Big dog speaking the truth.
Loving your commentary, Big George 🥊You sir are a class act and an all-time legend!
Wow you still look really good there George ,what ever you are doing keep doing it your dna needs preserved i would love just a tiny touch of it .
I'd have a beer, or two and the old champ would prolly have sweet tea.
This is exactly what I needed to hear today. I agree 100%. Thanks Big George!
Goerge hasent aged since 1994.. This guy looks the same?
Wouldn't you like to hang out one afternoon with this great dude...
Glad to see you on YouTube George!  FYI : You have a lot of echo feedback coming thru in your commentary/recording.
Well said George! Just subscribed! God Bless! 🙏🇺🇸
What a legend big George is
Nice.CHAMP💪
It sure is strange looking at George Foreman now, so sweet and calm. This man was one of the most menacing heavyweights in the world.
Good to see you…
Looking good Baba George!!!✨🥊✨
Just listening to this gave me goose pimples I'm just happy that I'm not the only one that recognises the Enormous Talent in these two men especially in Tyson fury.
Great man
George is a class act and there will never be another one like big George but in all due respect these guys pale in comparison Foreman fought in one of if not the greatest era the heavyweight division has ever known ! Your place will always be preserved in boxing history as one of the Greats
Thank you for sharing Big George! It was a great fight to watch. Looking forward to more of your thoughts on the great fights. 👍
Just found this channel…watched George from the Olympics..talk about a comeback story! I subscribed.
Wisdom from an all time great champion. 👍
Great Broadcast Champ! Next time REMIND THE VIEWERS TO...LIKE...COMMENT& SUBSCRIBE!🎊🎉😁
You're in a class of your own. GOD Bless You.
George has looked mid 50s for 30 years
I think the guy needs to be given a lot more credit to be honest after last night's performance. sure he maybe a bit limited fighting a 270 pounds+ guy who can move and box like a cruiserweight and can cut it up ruff and use his size and weight to his advantage also. but wilder showed great heart and toughness and fighting spirit. he was basically hurt and tired from round 4 but he kept going and giving 100% and he had his moments. there ain't another fighter in the division apart  from fury who has that type of heart and stamina. no other heavyweight could do what he did  last night. can you imagine how tiring it is to not only fight a guy that big but also deal with his weight advantage and strength and his rough house tactics. in my opinion, wilder still has a lot to offer he's easily the 2nd best heavyweight in that division without a doubt. he was like the T-1000 last night he's tough as nails. no other heavyweight has that type of spirit and he has enough in his locker with his power toughness and determination to still be successful. he earned my respect last night. wilder and the U.S fight fan's should be proud of the guy he  represented himself boxing and his country well.
Yep, great ref!
Does anyone not love this man George Foreman, a champion who has retained the title Gentleman?
Ah still not enough echo George 🤣 you asked who were the losers?  and said No One!  Try telling Deontay that when they were scraping him off the canvas 🤣 And remember G, Wilder lost 3 times in a row againts the only world class fighter his faced.
Champ your opinion is always  appreciated and on point!!
I've owned two George Forman grills.  The original was a masterpiece, used to full capacity  The 2.0 version didn't live up to the name.  Uneven and inconsistent.  George, make cheeseburgers great again!
George Foreman the legend. He said it perfectly! What an honour we have, to still have the legend with us today. 🙏🏾
The Great Man knows what he's talking about
You a real champ
What a damn legend. Still has his wits about him. His chin is made out of adamantium.
We will never forget George Foreman and  Muhammed Ali and as long as there is YouTube we can relive those great moments over and over again
Tyson Fury's next match will be against the self proclaimed, pound for pound champ, the 450 - 0 Charlie Zelenoff!
Always love to hear from one of the all time great legends on the current dynamics of the sport today.
SALAM !
George is turning back the hands of time! Looks amazing, we’ll said George you’re an inspiration for all that followed you:)
Outstanding!
wow !!1 Bravo Mr Foreman
George Foreman; one of the greatest in my book. Love to see him healthy and well. Childhood memories.
Looking good georgie. :)
I have an authentic George Foreman autograph!! It's a treasure to me!
Big George in his prime would have KO’d both of these guys. This wasn’t a “great fight” at all. It was a mismatch. Fury is a much better boxer than Wilder. Wilder was out of the fight by the 7th round. You can’t even compare this fight to any of the Ali-Frazier fights or the Ali-Foreman fight. Fury was 30 lbs. overweight and not sharp at all but he still had more than enough to beat Wilder badly. Fury is the best in the world today but he’s not a great boxer when compared to the giants of the past like Ali, Frazier, Foreman, Holmes, Tyson, Holyfield, Lewis. Let’s face it, it’s a pretty weak field if Wilder is bomber 2.
True legend
George that was an amazing title speech for all the people who were watching this fight. As a legend you speak peace, it is the mightiest force on the Earth I am in awe of both fighters simply because they are both Warriors. the Referee was incredible in his fairness.  like you said amazing..
Thanks for sharing your thoughts Champ. Great comments.
That was so dope coming from big George...much respect 💯
I wish sound will clear in the future
Mister Foreman, i swear to God i don't know why i love you but i have no reason to explain why because i simply do :D still seeing a legend like you still alive to give us your POV about these fights is a blessing, i wish i had a grandpa like you, i would've made you so proud :D💪🏻💪🏻
the legend him self Big George beautifully said
When are you coming back champ?
Thanks George,really love listening to you,,it was a great bout to watch,,all the best rom Sydney
Lovely suit, George.
Wise words from the living legend
It's an absolute honour champ that you provide your wise words on this platform. Wilder was unlucky to be half a second away from knocking out fury twice in three fights. I think overall the size and weight advantage played a huge part over the three fights. I do wonder at bridge weight if wilder wouldn't dominate
George you are the best!!
There was only 1 sportsman in the ring
Wilder was a winner too! Anyone who goes in the ring, two men go at each other even you lose you are still a winner in my book!! Wilder will be back he is too good of a boxer to quit!
Big George I love boxing never missed a match in 40 years and you are my absolute favorite I was working in hallsville back 7 or 8 years ago at the powerhouse there and was bout to finish up and head back home fla when I was in Marshall in a bbq joint seen your pic on wall and it didn't Dawn on me till right then I was in your home area and kicked my self in but I would have loved to have meet you like I said I loved George young and old seen all your fights you are one of but in my eyes the greatest of all time
I disagree about the refereeing. The ref let Fury lean on and headlock Wilder all night.  Warnings mean nothing.
The Gypsy King rules !!!!!!!
I have the most respect for you Mr Foreman. Loved your boxing matches and your positive spirit you present in every interview. You are a great man and for me always a pleasure to watch you fight and talk. May the Lord keep blessing you and your family.
I didn't know that George had a YouTube channel. I'll subscribe to him.🇬🇧
I just love you George, thats all I wanted to say.
Wow Amazing words man!
Love you George, your wit, humor and wisdom
I salute you George..... You are one of the best Heavyweights of all time.
Respect you to high Heaven Mr George Foreman, but the 15 second Round 4 KO count was a major issue for me. I wish these historical aspects remained in the past with Jack Johnson shielding his eyes from the sun against Jess Willard. The past may be cozy, but it is little else.
George foreman! An absolute legend ♥️♥️
God Bless you George, absolute legend
You are the best George. I am not sure if God loves you more than I do.
great clip Champ
looking good George. All the best
when these past boxers were in their prime, George Foreman, Holyfield, Bowe, Lewis, Tyson and few others....they would have beat either of these two to the ground easily
Thank Champ that was!
Lets be frank, Foreman even in his late career would KO' either Fury or Wilder within 5 rounds.
dont know why wilder wouldn't take defeat like a man  he will probably say fury won by foul or cheat  wilder would get more respect if he had taken fury's hand  in friendship  when fury went over to his corner after the ko   but wilder could only say  i disrespect you fury .    what a sore losers comment to make and no sportsmanship  displayed by wilder .     and you mentioned jack Johnson wouldn't you agree  Tyson fury is the new jack Johnson   prejudiced is alive and strong   i should know i am a gypsy man . like your channel big George  god bless you
you have nothing to say to any one about wining a fight as heavy weight when you lost in your prime to Ali and you are one of my favorites of al times so just stop it don't comment . I Love you and just live it like that.
God bless you champ🙏
that was one hell of a fight!  nice commentary george
My favourite boxer of all time Big George foreman. This man is the hardest puncher of all time.
Kind of like George Foreman vs Ron Lyle that’s the best heavyweight fight I ever seen Foreman vs Lyle
George was a formidable Fighter a bully great strength with a cool cold charisma to compliment his ferocity in the ring. He contributed in making Muhammad Ali may he be granted paradise, In becoming the legend he will forever be in history. My total admiration for this man of respect and honour George Foreman God bless you.
Great commentary!
One of the fatal flaws that I could see in Wilder's performance, was the lack of head movement. On a related note, you really don't see too much parrying anymore when it comes to boxing.
want to see wilder vs AJ , once Wilder AJ and Tyson Fury retire boxing will be dead again
George why didn’t the referee take a point for the excessive holding and head locks???
Enjoy all these videos :-) Foreman should attend all big events. He said it the best... It was a brilliant fireworks of a fight.
Lovable George "The Legend"
wilder was the biggest loser.. he showed no class at the end of the fight..
They're nowhere close to you all back in the days
The greatest Heavyweight fight I've seen. Wilder made this fight. Man what a heart of a Warrior and courage of a true Champion from Wilder!! Fury as well. Unbelievable!!! God bless them both and I thank you both for giving us a great trilogy and a magnificent third fight. I've never seen such courage and heart and will to never give up and keep on fighting from Deontay Wilder. He gave everything he had and was still trying to get up after that last knockout. May both fighters recover fully and remain in good health and get back safe to their families. Wilder has nothing to be ashamed about and no reason to hang his head low. After 41 knockouts the critics and boxing world didn't give Wilder his credit and respect but I think...I hope..after this third fight they give Wilder his flowers and his roses now because that man earned it. Had me entertained and screaming and just excited while watching this fight. A game of inches and a game with the highest of highs and lowest of lows. Wilder almost had Fury knocked out and out of there in this fight and just kep coming back. It reminds me of how Fury rose from the dead in the 12th round of the first fight. Wilder again was 1 second away or a half second away from a knockout win in that first fight but man just a great trilogy from these two champions. Bravo!
Tonight I saw history from a time machine….  I saw young ferocious George Foreman step  into the left corner of the ring.  In the right corner, a much older GF, who was decades older who loved God first, was humble, and wiser.  Thank the Lord, the wiser GF excited and will someday kneel before the Greatest Champion ever and this GF will be told;  “Well done George, my dedicated and faithful servant, come and rest with me”.  We love you George, not for your titles but because you change, and conquer, and give us an example of how to live and love!  Your fight summary tonight is a true example of how we should analyze our everyday life and shine forth love and positivity.  Signed, a fan, follower, and Believer.
Yesterday the great fights of the past came alive....well put from a legend who knows!!!
🙄🕵That wasn't boxing that was stationary slugging and wrestling
LEGENDARY FOREMAN!
I wish you the best, champ. Compared to your peers in Ali and Joe Frazier you look far and away the healthiest for your age. I hope things are well in your life and with your family and kids.
Yes champion talking
Fury best boxer all time
Never knew this stonking legend had a YouTube channel. Subbed
Perfect review of a great fight. Thanks, George.
GEORGE,GOOD TO SEE YOU WELL AND KICKING!!! HONESTLY IF THESE GUYS HAD BEEN FIGHTING IN THE '80's/'90's…THEY WOULD HAVE NEVER RANKED IN THE FIRST 30 IN ANY RANKING AND…YOU KNOW IT
The loser was Wilder ...  He is a bad loser
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC MR FORMAN - YOU SAID IT ALL AND AGREE 100% WITH YOU. SIDE NOTE > THANKYOU FOR THE MEMORIES TO THE HARDEST!!!! PUNCHER EVER...ALSO, FROM TIME TO TIME I STILL PULL UP YOUR FIGHT AGAINST MOORE, WOW! WHAT A MOMENT THAT HAD TO BE FOR YOU, AND WHEN MOORE SAID "HE GOT LUCKY" ALL I CAN SAY IS, "BULLSHIT"!   :)
Thanks for your thoughts Champ.
Look fresh as a daisy champ💯
You would of beat both of them easily in your prime.
❤ u champ
When George fought Lyle he was the ultimate intimidator but Lyle let it be known he wasn't the least bit intimidated at the face off
Love you George! You are legend 🥊
If George says it then it must be true.
Yes Sir ✌🏼
Fury cheated again.. Corked gloves.
From one legend to another legend. All love to you champ.
All true. Love your grills!😁
George i love you
George foreman grill! 👍
Thank you so much George, more videos please!
What a great man he’s become.  Young and brash, now mature , humble, intellectually honest.  Love him.   The same I can say for mike Tyson.  Both of them turned out to be great human beings after surviving unhappy youth years
Please get a proper mic, Champ
Well said Champ! This fight felt like Foreman v Lyle for sure.
Love you champ!!!
Credit to the champ.. But the one who talk now is more legend..
Much respect Champ! Wise words.
God bless you George, you are a great champion, a great man, and an inspiration to everyone. You have always represented boxing as one of the greatest of all time. Thank you for your inspiration to all of us.
Well said, salute champ!!
It must be interesting that Ali and Fury took 2 different roots to overcome the hardest hitter in their era. LPeed and endurance, i went for Speed amD
Champ well said. #truschoolsports
Agreed. The Ref was on point.
Awesome as usual George
I've waited for your take on this, George. Glad to see you in such a great shape!
Thanks Big George for all you have contributed to The Great Sport of Boxing that you helped make it as Great as it is today!  God bless and keep you my brother.
Fantastick words, thank you CHAMP!
I jus wish wilder was treated equal that count plan in simple was long to fury
George foreman is a great man, it's a shame he had to endure a talentless charlatan  like Larry merchant .
God bless you George love you
https://youtube.com/shorts/7mAbCG3ud1I?feature=share
The ref did not count wilder he did not give him that 10 count like fury got in fight 2 that part sucked
Helluva Fight
If..."IF"... Was a Fifth..... we'd all be drunk.
Keep making videos champ
Wahoooo 🎗️
It’s nice to see foreman so eloquent and still have his wits about him in his older age godbless him and his family he’s a living legend
It’s a bit sad.. As a Brit wanted Fury to win yet hold a big soft spot for Wilder and seeing him sacrificing himself at the champions alter by taking that last punch to the head with no defence to impede its delivery wrenched my stomach to its pit. Brave guy indeed. Brave guy in spirit. Brave guy to the end.. Wilder will always be a champion of men.
Thank you for sharing your comments Big George - You Rock! Miles Cobbett, Author of the HW Boxing Book Champion
GREAT FIGHT!!
💯🥊
Big George my favorite boxer of all time.....Had a chip on his shoulder when he was young, found god and is just big teddy bear today. Wish he would have fought Mike Tyson!
You are right! One of the best paid fights in a very, very long time!
Very true Forman,  they both need credits for the performance they did
The fact that you took the time to laud these contemporary lions proves that you are still a champion of the present, George Foreman Forever.
Its a pity wilders is such an a.....
"The shoes they made me wear were too heavy & tired me out." - Wilder
George we love you. Get your sound together. Put the mic closer to you.
It was an instant classic.
King George!! A great Christian man.
George will always be the GOAT. Always. Indestructible power.
It’s true the ref was fantastic, couldn’t really be said to be favouring either sides way of fighting and wasn’t afraid to make sure they were respecting his calls.
brilliant insightful and humble (as always) review. but i disagree about one thing you said ..no matter how good  we are not going to stop talking about greats like Big George Foreman any time soon
✓
It certainly did happen to remind me of Foreman vs. Lyle 45 years ago when I was 9 years old and look, here's one of the participants of that slugfest speaking highly of last night's slugfest. Bravo!
Pity wilder is a classless  tool
Thanks big George Foreman. You have wrapped it so nicely and precisely.
Well said, Sir.
Spot on George...
Hey George, take a thumbs up. 🤙
Big George, what a class act! National treasure!!!
He went out as he wanted to  on his shield. Peace Big George you still a Champ.
More people need to see this
Champ you are correct! I'm not going to argue with you. I've said some comments about the fight both good and bad about both fighters. More less bad about Wilder. You got me together champ with your take on the fight. I respect you and your opinion, very well spoken! Thanks
Bravo Sir!!!
Fact it went 11 rounds, both men knock down mutiple times,  even Deontay almost knock down Fury again in the 10th toward the end of the round.  Fury came back in the 11th for a knock out.   George great to hear you again,  your courage, faith in the Lord, come back is a inspiration to us all.
Great listening to the great George foreman but one thing I will say is we will never stop talking about George foreman and Muhammad Ali
I really think the Ref did an excellent job...he didn't let Fury lean on.D Wilder all night..it made the fight more competitive.. great job by everyone in the ring tonight
Mr George Foreman hardest puncher of all time! 🥊🥊🥊 respect to the big man
Ali vs foreman ...the best boxing fight..
Your still my favorite
George knows his stuff!!
Thank you champ. And i feel sorry to discover your Channel just now
Wilder lack of defense,  no headmovement,  extending arms,  angles,  n not bending knees
sei un grande
Big George,  that Louis/schmeling painting behind you is great. Who painted that?
With all do respect Mr. Foreman, People are still going to remember the gloves and all the other excuses that Wilders made. Wilder is still sour by not congratulate Fury for the win on the trilogy foght.
The greatest power puncher of all time hands down is George Foreman
still cant compare to foreman,frazier and ali u guys were on a different level
Spot on about the fair refereeing, BG. X
Thank you Mr. Foreman. You're always graceful and exhume the joy of the Lord Jesus Christ. More grace and blessings to you sir.
George Foreman - always a champ!! - gives the referee Russell Mora full credit. Agreed!  There were THREE champions in the ring this evening/night.  What a fight!!
TRUE CHAMP
Hello George.  Fury clinches too much
Yep. We have our ifs and buts but hey, it is, what it is.
Muscles don’t mean shit  -wilder and joshua
Wow... didn't know you had a channel :) Great to hear you take on that amazing fight champ! Thanks for that, and thanks for all the fights you have left us in the archives. Truly one of the greatest of all time!
Wow! George Foreman, a legend. You sir, are an amazing ambassador for the sport of boxing. Thank you.
It was a punch fest George, like you and Ron Lyle. Incredible
I lov u George I hope I will meet u personally
Most OP dude ever
ACE CHANP
Love you Big George from Bristol, England ❤️
George Foreman - Thank you for providing this amazing content!!! You are one of the few to thank the referee(s) for doing an outstanding job. They are never acknowledged properly. You are a stand-up man. We appreciate you and your many contributions to the sport of boxing. Utmost Respect - Always!!! Remain Blessed!!! ✝ 👊 ✝
Well said legend
I bet Floyd Mayweather is somewhere saying oh well if I had of trained him he wouldn't have lost
When we were kings respect for you foreman Ali you and Frazier so big and big and big than fury ,wilder Joshua in every sense of the words
Well said.
Sir. You are a gentleman
My favorite heavy champ of all time is george foreman . I tell people that all time .
What an absolute gentleman ❤️ . George Forman , sir ‘ take a bow ‘, I’ve put in place comments on the result of this fight and I’m so disappointed that there is no respect ✊🏿, no humility from from defeat 🥊🥊 . Talk is cheap , simples. Right or wrong, I’m of the opinion that Tyson is a ‘ White Ali ‘ by that I mean , he got into Wilders head each and every time . Ali always did it to his opponents. Ali won his fights and before he threw a punch 🥊 🤣 ! Enough said. Dave UK ❤️✊🏿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿👑
Wasnt the most skillfull fight but it was very exciting, reminded me of the fight scene from They Live lol. Just a scrap with little to no technique.
Brilliant!!!
Well said, George#themanwithpureheart.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us champ
Jorge fury did not beat the count second knock down ref saved him again
THÀT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST🥊🥊🥊🥊 FIGHTING💯🔥 🙌 👏 ❤ 😍 👌 ♥ I'VE SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME ⌛ ⏲ 😳 🥇🎖🏅👑👑🥂💘
Glad you’re on YouTube George , we love you and Houston loves you. 🤜🏽👑
watched n' rooted for ali live (on tv) kinshasha, watched n' rooted for foreman v moorer....for george to live long enough to see the fight, for me, just cool to be living through this guy's great career...tracked both his post olympic career n' then his post 87 career....how right he is ..the future's bright...
Jorge I got that as greatest fight in history
Best heavyweight (title) fight I've seen live too. Peace and respect from Lancashire UK.
I`m always amazed by the clear mind this man has after going through those bloody battles...wisdom and clarity...such a inspiration.
It is good to see you  Champ. God bless you Champ. As great as this fight was I think it should be nominated fight of the year and of all times.
Wilder will go down as the biggest sore loser.. I expect wilder to fire malik Scott becuz he tainted his water.   Hahahahahahahahaa
Wow that was absolutely incredibly inspirational to listen to, and George we could never put you and ali or Frazier aside because you guys but to name a few are locked into our memory banks forever more along with the present heavyweight warriors of today.
Big respect George foreman 🙏🙏
👍👍🙂🇹🇷
Man I be eating off you grill all the time I love Burgers
I forgot about the replacement of referry in the last minute, something smells fishy.
Thank you 🔥
Nice , great words from one of the giants of boxing, this was one for the ages
That was all time classic
I agree.. no losers in a great fight.  I wonder what Eddie hearn has to say about lack of ticket sales 🤔 🤣🤣🤣 GREAT FIGHT OF THE YEAR!!! Thank you to both boxers :)
HE Passed the TORCH !!!!!! George the GREAT has GIVEN his APPROVAL ....WOW
Thank you For your approval George!
Here here.
Thanks, Champ.
Was it not Tyson Fury counted out? And the referry stopped counting? Look at replay again please.
Told by the man with the master hands I mean the hardest hitting man of my time ,,,,to me
What a man big George definitely the top 3 best heavyweight fighters ever legend 👑👑❤️
Great message, Big George. And yes, it was a fight for the ages. And while not a title matchup, I still remember your great battle with Ron Lyle. And thanks to modern technology, young people who never saw that fight can see it anytime they want.
Great fight. Boring video George.  Lol. But much respect
respect from Ireland  🇮🇪🇮🇪 George. Thanks  for your great words .
holy shit that was refreshing, sometimes the brightest of minds comes in funny shapes and dates
Mr Foreman, That was a great assessment of the fight!
Thank you George and thanks to all the Champs, back in the past and those in the future!
ali foreman damm great times thought of my dad sitting next to me on  couch ! love ya george!
Good ol George.  God bless.
With my durespect I can't compare now adays fighters with golden era for boxing in 70s 80s 90s even 2000 but now adays there is no joy watching 2 bull's hummering each others with no skills no finesse.. no enjoyment at all .. for me boxing is dead .. tyson furry nothing but a joke same as wilder .. now adays if I want to watch and enjoy boxing..then I watch golden era ..money become more dominant factor these days nothing more..nothing less.. regards
❤
I wanna know Who are the 45 people that pressed thumbs down on George? gotta be some really bad people 😆
I love George foreman, he speaks the truth and says it as it is,   imagine he was starting his pro career now. God help all the heavyweights
I’m so glad to seeing you speak clearly with no problem. You’re the champ G.
At least this guy knows what he is talking about ! Great analysis 👌
Yes Sir I totally agree!! Much love Champ..
Big George
Horrible refereeing. Mora let Fury constantly put Wilder in head locks after warning him early. Plus gave Fury an extended count. Another black eye for the WBC which looked like the WWE... grappling and straight scripted.
Well said George. You will always be one of the best. Take the personalities out of it, this was one hell of a fight by two warriors. Glad you mentioned the ref too, best ref performance I have seen in a long time.
I respect you and have learned so much from studying your techniques, sir. Thanks for having a channel here, champ. If anyone is able to speak of the science of boxing it’s you.
Hello champ. Great video!
Big George! You the man !
What a gentleman and a truly great man.
Shades of Foreman-Lyle
George Foreman...What a lovely man.. If im not mistaken ,  a brother in the Lord...
Wilder looked over trained to me . Arms and feet were slow
Great reply champ
Top man
You cant get your achievements out of our heads , so dont even try Mr Champion.
Love your attitude Champ.
George Foreman comeback fights for me was like to not miss an enticing superhero movie series . You sure were an up to global  level contender at over 40, That was a special time , to see a fighter  my father was talking about to come back for a last time and devastate the boxing standards upwards.
Muhammad Ali is the Greatest of all time
Excellent commentary by the great George Foreman
Just wait champ, Deyonta Wilder will claim every excuse from the referee was paid off to menstrual cycle cramps..... Be prepared because it's coming....
excellent summary👍
Looking great George. So happy to see you keeping so well. Peace and love.
1990's George Foreman would clean today's HW division with ease.
Hey, Preacher. How does it make you feel when you hear Fury praising his Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ?
I hope Tyson and Deontay see your video. 👍
2 giants like George Foreman vs Ron Lyle...
George truth be told you were pulling for the guy that lost, you should have knew better
I’m happy to see you commenting on different things because I have a lot of respect for you Mr. foreman. When other people were trashing the United States in your Olympics you held up the American flag you were a guy who literally sold the lean mean grilling machine I mean that was your deal you took it from nothing to something massive. The fact that you rose from being up as you call it a petty thug as a young man to becoming what you are today often shows that anybody can be anything you are a shining example of that I have respect for you for boxing yes but more so for the person you are.
I would imagine that this is the most well respected kind of praise that Wilder and Fury could get for their performance. When you earn the respect of other greats of this magnitude you know something was special.
Big respect to Big Foreman from Scotland🥊
I disagree champ, the loser was the guy that refused to shake hands....
Hi George, if I had of been a fighter or boxer at top level,  I would have hated getting in the ring with you in the 1970 or anytime after , I felt so, so sorry for your opponents,  the way you punished their bodies with your punching and switch to the head , poor Joe Frazier,  Ken Norton,  George Chuvalo , by did your punnish them ,what a powerful hitter you where and a very good boxer 👍👏
You are so very loved friend of athletics, and the ONLY fist to demonstrate effect on the solid 1 tone iron block they referred to as Joe Frazier.
Thanks champ! Nice to see you still punching, great man 🙂
George would have destroyed them both.
What a humble beautiful person he is. You will always be mentioned in the realms of heavyweight greats. I would love to meet this guy someday.
Definitely one of the greatest title matches
Big george good to see him. Talking and looking great. CHAMP.
fury seems to have a chin from big georges day
True gent!!!
The disrespect on aj. Anyone who isn't biased can clearly see that them two didn't want AJ smoke
Tyson Fury, what an honour it must be to listen to the ultimate gentleman and legend that is Mr George Forman talking about your legendary fight and about your deserved win!  Lovely post and a truly lovely man, Mr George Forman. (Lucky enough to have met you once at the Lennox Lewis v’s Razor Ruddock fight years ago at Earls Court, London) 🙏🇬🇧
Definitely a classic,a real throwback!!!
Enjoyed your honest contribution George, God bless you my brother.
Good fight but what I liked about the past and remember you are always a great champion and a gentleman
Who don’t Love George ….
George I think you have the style to beat fury. Make a comeback
Lené  35 -ével  fiatalab " , ott  játszana  közöttük "!!!
george foreman----a very smart, insightful, articulate man.
We l8ve you champ
I don’t believe it for a second. George .  Mick Tyson could of taken these chums out , one in the first rounds and the other in the second round.  I’m honestly upset  that George said all of this BS. It was a great B grade fight.  No speed or defence. Look at the no foot work .No knock out power. George forgets himself her for mind.
What a legend !
Gotta love this man, one of the ATG’s
🥊🥊 Love You George ... Bless You & Your Family
George WE miss your "RING SIDE" commentary. Much respect to YOU.
George the best of all times   ,wilder got whooped  and fury is the king for this generation  in the heavy weight
Ole George Foreman your one of my favorite boxers there will never be another one come along that is a great of a boxer as you were you came back at 46 years old i believe and won the heavyweight championship of the world against a man half your age your a legend George it would be a dream come true just to shake your hand one time and your George Foreman grills are one of the best if not the same in house grills that were made kuddos to you My friend!!
Well said and much respect King ✊
ifs buts maybes & little jelly babies great fight.
Sir  George foreman.  We respect n support you. Love Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Foreman in his prime would destroy Wilder in between 2 rounds
Love you King Georgie!
I watched the fight and could not turn away. It was amazing only sightly tarnished by horrible commentary.
Big George!!!
George your simply quality first and foremost God bless 👏🤛👊 new kids on the block look listen and learn from those elders.
Форман в своё время, отправил бы обоих спать.
i thought the ref split them too early at times when some great inside work was being done. probably nitpicking and i defer to the master.
I'd love to see Lennox Lewis, Roy Jones Jr and George Foreman together as commentators for high profile fights!!
Love big George.pure class.
Will never compare to you’re era - when fighters were fighters - UK fan 👍👍 Respect to you Sir
The heavyweight Mack truck!  👍
The kind of fight a kid would see and say to himself "that's what I want to be, a great fighter like Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder". Just like a kid a long time ago would say "I wanna be great like George Foreman, after seeing Jan 24 1973, Kingston Jamaica.
Good overview. Well said champ.
Sounds like pre fight lol
This analysis means a lot coming from Foreman.
Kudos Champs!
I enjoyed Former Champs words ,thank you sir
Respect great men.
Wilder disrespected George a few years back as well as many old greats... Now Tyson fury knocked wilder out for all the greats as well as for himself , his fans and the people close to him.  Wilder has been defeated for the 3rd and final time in a row by the great Tyson fury...
Big George,, Carl Frampton and junior fa are all running great analysis channels right now..  Its Sad for the sport  that so many random Muppets making fanboy vids in their bedrooms seem to get more subscribers than people with actual top level, in ring experience
We love you george. Thank you. I said the same things you said to my friend last night
I seen the highlights wilder still makes a lot of fundamental mistakes with no gas tank. He's exposed as a one-dimensional fighter just the right hand.
Nice one George
IMHO George Foreman is one of my favorite Boxers , I think he could beat Wilder and Fury on same night.
Love ya George 🥊 👑
George Foreman wouldve reigned supreme in this era
George one of the last of the golden generation heavyweights left!Bless you champ!🙏
GEORGE FOREMAN IS ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL TIME
Wilder was the loser, not because of the outcome but because if his attitude. His refusal to accept defeat graciously and continue to be obstinate shows his immaturity as a boxer and a man. Blaming circumstances beyond your control makes you a victim and robs you of any ability to change the outcome. Own it like a man and use it.
Usyk vs Fury will be really great fight
Got to love this Living Legend <3
you gotta love George
3❤🙏🏻🙏🏾🙏🏽🙏🏼🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏻
Thank You George!
Mr Foreman, your era was the best for boxing, but boy did we get a flash of that last night
Well said George.
Yeah, I agree with all of that. Glad you spotted the ref. He played his part too.
Well said "CHAMP" for calling out the IF-FLEAS! They're so irritating.....❤ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂_✌
If George Forman puts his stamp of approval on the fight it most certainly was good 👍
You are my favorite all time Champion. Thanks for your thoughts.
Mr. Foreman, you have had many fights and seen many. I respect you because you have lived long enough to see life
fluent and articulate too
I’ve been riding high like back in the olden days of boxing. My fighting soul is singing a song it hasn’t sang in a long time! So grateful to have seen this fight live. I’m heavy in my fight feelings on God!
Would love to hear you call the next big fight George!
Well said sir and so true
🤎
Make a short video everyday Champ. Your experience and wisdom is needed in our everyday life.
George, you're quite right about the referee being brilliant. He immediately realized that he had to stop the fight, after Fury's last devastating punch, even before Wilder hit the canvas. He actually tried to catch Wilder in his arms making the fall somewhat smoother and softe, anyway as it seemed to me.. I've never before seen a referee do that.
Interesting you say this about 'title fights' George as I think the greatest \heavyweight fight of all time I ever saw was actually you against a guy called Ron Lyle I think.
Your are my #1 fav fighter on Fight Night Champion !! That mean George Foreman Jab and Hard right hand. Love you George I beg the heavens that you live another century with us with your beautiful spirit ! God bless 🙏
Big George!!
Big George foreman knows a great fight when he sees one 🥊
Beautiful statement.
God bless you Sir
EEErrrrmmmm excuse me, the Bronze Shithouse lost.
Thanks big George. Wilder was damaged after the 1st Fury fight, more than I once thought. 2nd and 3rd fight he wasn't the same man as  the 1st one energy wise.
Welcome to the "No-Rope-A-Dope!" He got beat by Flabby Back! He fall down. LOL.
Legend
George Foreman n Mohamed Ali, they were the protagonists of a great fight like yesterday
These are truly beautiful words champ!
There will never be fighter's like those in the Ali, Foreman era! There's too much Money and Fame involved  in the sport today,  there's no real Hunger
He lacks conditioning and endurance including feet and head movement. Therefore making him a one trick pony like fury said and as much as it hurts that he was beat I'm still man enough to give fury his flowers for a honest win.  No hate man I still got mad love for Wilder but he's been lied to by even his new trainer with making him think he's truly able to go 12 rounds when he was burned out early before the 8th.🤥  He doesn't like doing cardio but now he found out the hard way that without it he's no more than a 5 rounder at best. And a punchers chance won't save him if his lung's can't sustain the wind he need's to control his breathing in order to make it 12 rounds.  Fury was always the better boxer with all the tool's to go 12 rounds so I won't make anymore statements about his pass since the present is all that matter's. He won honestly and without any corruption. Congratulations Tyson Fury and thank you for being a good sport after you won.
This was one of those fights that transcends race/nationality. Regardless of what side of the fence you were on, it was impossible to not admire both men for putting on such a war. This is the kind of fight that will be remembered.
Instead of a George Foreman statue the world to a George Floyd statue. SMH What messed up world we live in.
I love George Foreman. He's one of the strongest punchers ever but he still had one of the biggest hearts ever.
George when Are You coming back to show them who the real deal is.   Only one punch George only one. Lol.
i love you george but russel mora is one of the worst referees out there, there are many much better ones, but hey different views is all...i was hoping an erratic blow would catch mora in the kisser and take him out for the longcount....
How many seconds is there in a 10 count?? That ref robbed Wilder
It was a fight that will go down in history as an all time classic.
Great speaking George.. from  Long Tom from Wales
Loved it and love you Champ I subscribed. Stay say and healthy...
Remember me George. Nice to see you too.  Love your commentaries everytime. Keep up the good work. Gonna get me one of those lean mean grilling machine baby
Coming from GF, The Champ….🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great piece. They say boxing is injurious to your health, but George, you are still as sharp as a tack. I agree with your conclusion 100 per cent.
Um colosso talento do boxe mundial chamado George Foreman elogiando essa luta espetacular... Parabéns !!!!
This fight was a shot in the arm for boxing two great gladiators left it all in the ring and the public will be talking about this fight for decades to come. Thank you big George your era of boxing is still the greatest of all time but certainly, these two giants would have held their own during your years with Ali and Frazier and a host of other heavyweights.
Americans often don't talk but preach.  Yes I know Foreman was a preacher but here's not in a pulpit here but supposed to be talking like a normal human being about a boxing match.  Weird.  Ans what's mildly disconcerting is Big George sounds a little punchy/slurry here, the 1st time I've noticed this.  Maybe old age...
George you're a legend! God Bless you and keep you safe and well.
What a great fighter Mr Foreman is and a true gentleman.  I pray that you are in good health.  My vote goes to Big George as hardest hitting heavyweight ever as he was part of the golden heavyweight era. God bless
God bless George a great Texan
Too bad Goerge you man lost and I guess his going to retire
Fury does not look good.Cassius Clay looked the part.Iron Mike looked the  part.
Well said, champ! Always keeping it real and positive. One disagreement I have with what you said: there are losers in this fight...it's all of the Deontay Wilder nuthuggers who somehow believe Wilder was cheated of a victory. Wilder fought like a warrior and should be proud of himself; but Deontay really needs to examine his thoughts, accept his defeat, quash his loser nuthuggers and their conspiracy theories, make peace with Tyson Fury, and move forward with his life.
I love George Foreman!
Good to see you are still doing well champ..
Thanks for sharing your thoughts Mr. Foreman. I also want to thank you for being such a great story of how to rise from almost nothing, and make yourself into more through God’s blessings. Keep doing what you’re doing.
Good to see Big George in fine fettle.
Hello George nice to see you!
It should have been called The Clash Of The Titans!!
Man does this man age? He looks the same and i look like hell
The four georgeman
This guy is my all time fav heavyweight. Nothing but love for big george.
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Sir Foreman ! Great to hear such a legend, I wish you a long and happy life
Super commentary 👌👌
Use a mic Sir, it will make a big difference to the viewers, your growing channel needs it! 🙏🙏
Great commentary Big George Foreman i the Joe Louis boxing portrait behind that’s really cool 💯.
I saw this channel and subscribed immediately. Please try to get a lav mic or some type of mic so that George can sound better. Thank you and I’m excited to hear more commentary from George Foreman!
I used to have a foreman grill.
the champ himself George Foreman, mad respect!
Thanks George 👍
Thanks George...great fight.
Much love George <3
Bless you George
Can you please gorge please as you have nothing to fear.  Please I'm sick to death of all the bs that wilder has to contend with.  So please count for yourself how long fury was on the floor for as I just can't get over the fact how they robbed him again as clearly for me fury lost clearly so please make a statement and tell the world that after all the cheating last time and this time they robbed him via the count.  Yes fury did get up at the count of 16
Great insights, Champ!
Great words from one of the greatest ever Good on you George
Great fight; great comments from a great champ of yesterday. The past came alive! Two great warriors, like George and Joe Frazier, George and Ali.
Well said Champ!
Agree regarding the refereeing, He did an excellent job! But a, "Great Fight" ? I'm not so sure.  It certainly doesn't come close to the "Rumble in the Jungle " or,  "The Thriller in Manila "!  The best Heavyweight Fight I saw recently was, Usyk versus Joshua.  Usyk was total class, He outboxed, he Schooled Joshua 100!  Previously to that Fight, I just don't rate this Generation of Heavyweights.  I know you shouldn't compare Generations, but I grew up through the Seventies and saw some Great Fights, and saw Mike Tyson climb the heavyweight ladder.
George Foreman is a living Legend … He has class and is intelligent. Much Health to you George. Live Long ✌️👍😎
WBC and TopRank deserves a federal investigation like USA did with FIFA. Robson Conceição was robbed against Oscar Valdez ! Doping and Mafia 💉💉💉💉🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀
Well said big George,  both Ali and you gave us an epic fight for so many reasons and you will remain one of the GOAT boxers!
This man is THE ALLTIME  hardest puncher.
I was rooting for Wilder. He looked exhausted before the match even started
Foreman,gentleman and legend
3:30 - Humility on display. Passing the torch. One man's sunset is another man's dawn.
Looking good Champ
George I think you can knock them both out still today.
Great man, great fighter
God bless George🥊🥊 Foreman 🙏🙏🙏🙏
wilder must be proud of himself.great fight.there no other fighter can beat wilder only fury.wilder to me will go down as one of the greatest with fury.because of wilder fury will go down as one of the greatest fury and wilder can nat be beaten by any other fighter
Wilder should have asked you to help his camp , Champ 🥊
Man George is just so wholesome and respectful, what an all time great. Loving the videos George!
Big George, nothing but class.
Hey George, I'm an old man and I will always talk about your fight with Lyle. You talk about heavy punches and the will to get back up, that fight was the best  !
I don't want to hear about no deontay wilder this man right here is the most destructive puncher in heavyweight history
Foreman really is an ageless wonder!
This is George foreman biatch
Fabulous Fight, Brilliant Tribute from a True Hall of Fame Boxing Legend! 👊😃💯💯
Grandpa George look at how my son does boxing and how he dodges punches https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU5KlK7JLyQ What do you say, Grandpa George??? Дедушка Джордж посмотрите как мой сын занимается боксом и как он уклоняется от ударов https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU5KlK7JLyQ что скажете дедушка Джордж???
I have to hand it to the ref too....man he was on it. Small guy like that walking in between those two silverbacks.....the guy was rolling around the ring in his big brass balls.
that's a real box fight say .i still enjoy your box fights that are unforgettable george.
I love George Foreman. What a guy
He looks fantastic, I want to know his secret!
My favorite boxer in history, George foreman the greatest fighter
God grace to see former champ. I was not even born, rumble in the jungle. Mr Foreman, I also give credit where credit is due. I want to ask, is it important to camp away from your wife, both Tyson and Usyk had not been with woman for months. Look at Wilder, at press conference ,him was holding his wife hand..
Glad to see you healthy and well Mr Foreman, enjoying the channel!
I tip my hat to wilder. fury is a dirty bastard. blatant cheating, time and time again, despicable referee, and what, he's a 'home referee' ? ain't wilder American? ain't it in Vegas? oh, yeah, the great white hope. and wilder never bitched. once, hats off Deontay, I reckon you would've had him out of there, and in fact, probably did
Two hall of fame careers, what a fighter George Foreman was.
Heavyweight Boxing has been great for a while now! Been a Luis Ortiz fan for a while. I think he can still upset anyone inside of 6 rounds. I doubt any champion will risk it. Glad to see Tyson Fury beat the disrespectful Wilder. Then again Larry Holmes ran his mouth a little hard after Leon stopped him from breaking Rocky's record.
cheating again, in the 4th round when Tyson got knocked out the referee did not stop at 10 seconds, he kept counting to 17 to give Tyson time to recover. The true winner was wilder
How does Foreman look so damn good and mind as sharp as ever.
If I was Tyson fury i would be feeling elated at winning and defending his belt in such a convincing fashion! And to be praised by the great man in such a complimentary way would be the absolute cherry on the cake! Big respect to deontay for carrying on from the 6th to the 11th! I feel he let himself down by not being gracious in defeat though! What now for Tyson??? Maybe 2 fights left? Dillian white then either AJ or usyk? As a Brit I would love to see Tyson beat AJ and then retire. Big love and respect to the gypsy king🇬🇧
Could listen to him all day. Great guy👏
Shut up George. You are the greatest of greatest yourself. You are too humble sir. Salute. Keep healthy Champ.
I see so many similarities  between wilder and the young George foreman who fought Frazier  and ali
Nobody represents boxing better than George Foreman.A goat in and out of the ring.
And you have to take note and respect the legend George Foreman when he says that this fight will go down in boxing history as one of the best title fights of all time
Grilliant
Well said George
Shades of Foreman-Lyle in last night's fight.
I have always loved George Forman since his Olympic fight many years ago.  Last night was a GREAT Fight
What a giant of a man 2 times heavyweight champ George Foreman, I'm so happy I lived to see the past come alive again.what a fight it was,edge of the seat job Tyson fury has put the world on notice,I'm the best the no1 . 2 time's heavyweight champ fighting is my game Tyson fury is the name.Tyson has put usix,a.j on notice I'm coming to re claim those belts.Tyson fury 6ft 9" 19 stone who can stop him,my opinion only one man can stop him his name Tyson fury.  Well done Tyson what a talent you are he told everyone from a 14 year old I will be a world champ no one could beat him,people laughed not laughing now.fantastic.

Never knew big George had a channel!! This man always speaks the truth and has no problem giving modern athletes their due  He has a humble heart that many can learn from  Big respect to one of the best and baddest to ever do it!  Imagine a 25 year old George v Fury 😳 It would be ferocious
Hello Mr George Foreman. 2 time world 🌍 ( that's the entire world ) heavyweight boxing 🥊 champion. Olympic gold 🥇 medalist. Ordained minister. ( I'm sure today you consider that first , most important achievement). Please come to visit us in Israel . The holy land. You will be welcome with open arms. And I hope to meet you. I was to young for the Frazier fight. But saw the Moorer fight. An inspiration to all athletes , young or getting older. It's the mind and spirit come first. We love you champ. God be with you.
Just subscribed keep posting regularly George. God bless you and yours much love from the UK
All class.  Typical george foreman.  Has enough class dripping off of him that the classless can get a full dose
Im a Wilder fan at the end of the day Fury won.
Wise words from big George but can't see anymore fights like that for a while... They won't fight each other again and there's no other HW that could go toe to toe with either of these two warriors.
Great fight!  Thank you for sharing your thoughts Sir.
Exellent point on the ref.  I dont care for bayless and his overtness in a fight.. this guy let them work in the clinch.. didnt take no crap from either side with fouls. chewed fury out over the hea.dlocks. And wilders back of the head .. the best ref job in history.. good job .  It was just the perfect night on all accounts
Well said 🙏👍👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🥊
👋👋🙏
Good man Foreman
Thank you so much, Champ!
Sir you're the best heavyweight champion of the history. Greetings from Italy Champ!! Legend!!
Hey "Big George" not trying to rain on your parade bro, but please please go back & closely review the "Ref's" count on "Fury" bro,( not asking you to confirm anythang cause I know you don't ruffle any feathers in the system), frankly I do understand, but just wanted you to slow 🐌 motion that count that potentially saved "Fury's" ass in the 4th round👌🏼; just saying, all that gliders ain't gold my man, we miss what is obvious, especially when one ain't the chosen one. Hm🙃🤨🙄😟🧐🥴🥊💉🤮🦧? Amen 🙏!!!
Well said by foreman, he's relieved to see boxing making a come back... Brings back memories of the good old days for such a great fighter.
Wilder could have been the best ever if he would learn basic mechanics and not just depend on a huge right hand he had soo much success w it that he never learned the trade craft i also dont like his lack of sportsmanship but for raw talent he has it all but not the mindset
Well said Sir.
a champion and a gentleman
Don't take the vaccine in Jesus Christ mighty name amen!
Peace, to the GREAT MR. GEORGE FOREMAN!
Yeah, first fight that came to mind to compare it with this one was your slugfest with Ron Lyle. Never thought I would see something like that in these times.
Love wat you said George but Wilder not up there with Louis, Ali, Holyfield, Johnson, Tyson, Holmes, Liston, Foreman or even Lewis, Bowe, or Morrison, infact he wouldn't make top 50 but for power & power alone he's definitely top 10!
The Helenius Kovnatski fight was also good.
Wow, I bought a Tefal grill on Friday instead of one of yours, I feel guilty now after those words.
Big George foreman, still got his faculties in his 70s with the punches he took (and dished out of course) . Good stuff. Good luck to you George, much love to you and your family.from 🇬🇧
We will never quit talking about or forget George Foreman. You are a great man, sir. Thank you for all that you have done and continue to do!
Personally I don't feel that it anyway matched the Bowe v Holyfield trilogy of the mid 90's, let alone the 15 Rd slugfests of the 70's. A good trilogy, but with sloppy skill's on display.
Thank you legend! You are such a great man!!!
I hope you stay alive to see a lot lot more great fights George. You are one of the all time greats mate. 👏 👏 👏
Legend
I agree with everything you said George but I still say in your prime you lick both them fellas but it's an honor to hear you talk and you speak the truth and you're such a humble likeable man if all these modern champions could just take your personality boxing would be great again champ fury one all three fights we know that I was a Wilder fan being an American up until the second fight and all the excuses I didn't hear you come out with one excuse after the Zaire fight not one and I've watched boxing a long time you took your lumps along with your victories and stride thank you for just being you big George much love
Always great to hear from George. If he says that was a classic fight, it was a classic fight.
Anyone else like and subscribe just out of respect for a great champion and greater man?
The ref counted way too slow in round 4. Even Andre Ward said why is the ref counting so slow. Wilder got screwed a second time on the count. The fix was in when they switched the ref two days before the fight.
George Foreman, A class act!!! Love this guy.
I AM JUST 24 YEARS OLD n The man realy i know. The big one, strong ,powerfull,  in Boxing world is George Foreman. If Young George travel come to meet floyd mywhether in his prime .nobody cant stop you ..Same with now ..If young george travel to meet fury or anybody in boxing arena right now i think so easy to you george.  .i promise that .
Foreman is the man..
Big george. One of the greatest to ever do it 🙏🙏🙏
For me my alltime favorite fight will be always Tyson vs Tucker.
Absolutely beautifully said
continued Good Health and Success to Uncle George Foreman!
A fight for the ages. Hats off
I thought Wilder was not counted out....it was lights out and over.
Your looking GREAT Sir! Didn't know you had a YouTube Channel, I'm now subbed too! 👍🏿
Well done on giving the ref his flowers. I thought he was superb as well
Nou nou man you now you and Ali  frieser is van a caind  you vas meid offf steel not off vod in thes day 💪💪💪👍👍
The greatest trio of boxing: Forman, Frazier,  Muhemmed Ali. But my favourite boxer of all time is the 80's Mike Tyson.  Thanks George and all the best.
Very very true best TITLE MATCH becouse there has bin wars non title
So nice to see a strong and health Ex Boxer
Two words best describe George Foreman; GREAT AMERICAN.
George you and Ron lyes was great
I still put my money on Big George if it was possible vs Fury, just watch Foreman vs Gerry Cooney think it would look like that.
They might be great fighters but in my mind not great champs. These two lack something. Definitely don't have the class outside the ring as you George or Evander. Or even Lennox and either Vladimir or Vitali...
One of the greatest Americans alive today and of any time!  The true American dream!  How did I not know you had s YouTube channel?!?  Much love and respect, Champ!
This was not a fight, it was another beat down, Tyson got careless for one round, never got hurt. Wilder stood no chance, he looked tired the 1st round.
Oh my god who do you think you are? You act like you're literally a living legend, an icon to every fighter world wide. You act like you've been in the sport your entire adult life, and as if you actually boxed Frazier, Muhammad Ali, Norton.....I mean it who do you think you are buddy, you think you're George Foreman or something?  👍 Thank you for your time George. Tyson Fury is so damn good, so gifted by our God himself he makes you truly wish he was OUR fighter from America. Wilder reigned supreme for years, then Tyson Fury stepped back into that ring and cement his dominance across this wide world. We all used to respect Wilder through and through but he really spoiled that with his childish lies, conspiracy theories of his first loss to Fury, but lastnight when Fury came over to congratulate him on a legendary fight himself yet he turned away and ran from the ring. Come on man he fought so hard for so long to earn everything we just wish he didn't spoil it like that
Love your commentary!👍🏽
Thank God we know see a fight instead of the Klitschko days of jab and move combined with no personality.
A truly  excellent commentary.
Fury vs. Wilder III was so amazing that I have already listened to over a dozen post fight commentaries. George Foreman, your commentary here is my favorite of them all. Thank you for putting this great fight into perspective for the generations to come.
Always a pleasure to hear from you Champ.
That's what I was thinking when watching. This is like Foreman vs Lyle.
BIG GEORGE FOREMAN!!!
You summed it all up in one George. Thank you sir “YOU ARE A LEGEND”
IF wilder had showed some respect after the fight.
George, you said it right but so so eloquently.
So awesome to have Foreman still
Great fight, kinda like you vs Lyle !!
Foremen is in his 70's, but looks likehe's 48-49ish here. What a jerk. lol
George, anyway to adjust the temperature on my grill?
George has declared the present to be a new golden era of heavy weight boxing 🥊 wow it means so much more coming from him. George foreman is my favorite boxer ever, would be glad to see someone like him come onto the scene.
George is the man !
Well said George!
Love you Big George. keep the videos coming please, we just love seeing you. Respect!! 💪🏿✊🏿👑
George Foreman is the Truth!
Always a humble, professional, you are one of a kind George!
Filter on your mike george better sound
BIG GEORGE FOREMAN! The man who can cave a Heavy bag with a single straight right!   Still have my first original Foreman grill!
You should do this more often i love to hear your takes on boxing Id also of course be always interested in your opinions on recent grills
Big George! Just found your channel....the ref made the fight great! No nonsense...fair calls right down the middle.
Nice one George
Big respect. Love big George.
George Forman is such a great man of GOD. Clean tongue
💯👌George forman
When the heroes are humbled  The fact must be said 👍
Yeah, Fury got damn near a fifteen second ten count. Go watch the clock and keep track. Smh
When are you coming back @George Foreman?
Tyson got help with the ring count again. Man they can't let nothing be fair   https://youtu.be/xeQbDd7whlQ
I remember watching him knocking people out and it always looked like he wasn't even trying, more years to sir
George if you were a Brit you would be Sir George! What a great and humble man you are and for acknowledging Tyson and Deontay as the new" Greats " of boxing
You are forever a great man Mr. Foreman, God bless you and yours!!
I feel chills even subscribing to the channel, it's like subscribing to God!
Great video George. Thank-you!
Disagree on the referee
So well said, George!!!
well spoken
George Foreman is great man and great champion what a guy.
100% subscribed, props from the UK.
All hail Big George!For me you are the Greatest!Nice commentary
We Love you George! So glad your doing good! 😊
George great words, I concur 1000%
Wilder was tired and missed that left hook and left himself defenseless too long from the side, it seems. As Mike Tyson's coach said,  get in a position where you can hit him, and he can't hit you; that was the final position for Fury to win from.
Only 1 lesson in life, don't Quit.. or die trying 🙏❤️✨
Great man big George
That was great! Nice one George!
Big George!!!! Respect to you brother 🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
glad you healthy
I'm waiting for Wilder's excuses for his last lost!
We LOVE you Big George!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Man, George is an example of a man born to fight. This guy took thousands and thousands of powerful punches and speaks clear as day in his 70's.
George vs Ron Lyle was a classic
Wish I could have watched it but crappy cable provider doesn't make pay per view possible.Do you think these 2 will ever fight again George  ?
Beautiful words champ
Please give Anthony Joshua a call he could do with your advice.
THE GREAT GEORGE FORMAN?????
who got counted out, the ref called it before wilder hit the floor
It's a privilege to hear Big George offer his opinion, and there is a parallel with his bout with Lyle.
Perfectly put by a legend
Didn't even see the video yet. Just gave a like to see a legend speak
I am so happy you are doing well ...... as a kid, my father and I loved watching you..... you are a true warrior and a National treasure      :-)
Very well spoken , true legend
Big George praising the fight is the cherry on the cake. Bless you champ!
This is so the legend talks about boxing. A lot of respect & love from Sweden to you,  mr. George Foreman. 🌹❤❤❤
George your fight with Ron Lyle is the greatest heavyweight fight of all time! Never forget it watching that fight with my dad and Howard Cosell calling it live on television. It was the first fight I ever watched and was the day I became a fight fan and a George Foreman fan foreever. Keep putting out the video's.
👍❤🇭🇺
Well said “Champ”.
You are a beautiful soul - so humble. Truly a great!
What a great summation from a humble man. 💓
Love Big George, Man was A Monster in his day.
Big George salut
Mr Foreman, genuinely, I’ve always thought you were one of the. Greatest.
Mr Foreman! You are a legend.   I have one request though- please get rid of the echo.
Great to see George in such great health. What a Fighter, What a Man, What a Legend !
Thank you George! I love you!
George is a class act!!!
My all time fav Heavyweight! You're a great man. Thanks for this vid champ!
Your grill messed up Michael Scott's foot 😒
God bless Big George Foreman. I love this man.
I think u would've stood a better than decent chance against Deontay, George.  And on that note Tyson made a comment on how he just stood toe to toe with the biggest power puncher in boxing history.. That's also debatable because my vote would be for you also on that. I think your great George and to drift a little off subject you also would've possibly beat Ali if the scales had just been tilted a little more.  No offense but you were a bundle of nerves that night, anyone could see that...(you beat yourself) And Ali was as ready both physically and mentally, as any human could be....Love you George,  you have came a long way as a man that's what I respect most about you!
Your a legend and an inspiration George.
Great Great man Sir George a legend, well said.
Wilder showed great heart, but couldn't come up with the answer. A lesser man would have been taken out before the 5th or 6th round. I think he was out on his feet before that last crushing right hand.
It'd be great to take the natural reverb off of the recording's audio.  Let me know if you want some help with that.
George could come out and beat Tyson now imho
Thank you George, great job, we miss you
Mr foreman we can NEVER stop talking about your bout with mr alli xxx love from Doncaster England … but your analysis was spot on as usual .. what a fight … both fighters have gave us the best trilogy I can remember .. love them both and you as well ❤️
When big George pays tribute it’s a worthy tribute ….thanks big fella..
Great to see and hear from you again George!  It would have been great to see you in your prime against Fury!
Wait big George has a YouTube channel? let's go!!!
Well said George!
Thats right mr. Foreman. Many Greetings from germany
The best man Mr fuzzy George the best
Je suis ému par l’engagement de la grande communauté de la boxe à mousser ce combat à posteriori pour contrebalancer la UFC et sa domination totale des parts de marché.
George Foreman, great commentary, fight was great and so was official.  The real winner was 'us', fight fans and the audience Two fighters in their prime were willing to fight and gave their full hearts.  Polar opposite of Floyd vs Manny, prom dance of the century. This fight, Fury vs Wilder a classic.
Mr George  you are a billionaire. Plz spend $10 dollars on a microphone you bloody cheapskate.
You're the best George! We love you
What a legend
Legendary Big George!
Wow George Foreman has a utube channel finally a master boxer having a. Handel I know I’ll never miss his postings.  George you look great and gave us some of the best fights ever and are still smart and love listening to you thank you a million times
Thank you George. You could'nt have sumed it up any better in your brilliant philosphical way!
George we all miss your generation of fighters.The best in history..And we all know the truth.And the truth is none of the heavyweights today would las past round 2 with George Forman or Ali Frazier etc etc...I am 73 years old now and i know you guys were the best.
It was great George , but not as good as yours v Lyle
2 great fighters. Awesome!! I was reading something on another You Tube video the other day. Some people were saying Foreman is the greatest of all time...certainly one of.
Thank You George for posting this recap of this great Fury Wilder fight!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
George foreman u r a true legend
Hey George!  I love you Buddy.  Way to give Kudos to the ref.  What I noticed was that he tried to cushion Wilders head from hitting the canvass quite so hard.  I never saw that before, so you're right,.  A GREAT REF!!!  He might have saved a few marbles for Wilder that he might need some day.  That ref was on his toes like I've never seen either.  I've seen some other examples where the ref took the mouthpiece out of a fallen fighter's mouth.
The mummy himself george foreman
Send Tyson a grill George
Джордж, ты сильнейший!
Mr. Foreman wish you luck with youtube. I hope your chanell makes ot big soon.
George, you would have whooped them all in one night.
I saw a replay of Forman Lyle years later, that was a great fight too
Thank you Sir when I was a boy here in England I'd sit with my dad & we'd watch your fights against Frazier, Ali, Norton & many more thank you so much I'll treasure those memories for as long as I live, once again many thanks. 🙏
Much respect to George saying fury's the best!
Your matches are built into the fabric of the sport and part of the standard from which great matches are measured. This sure was a generational match,I still have my insides churning from the excitement.lol... If If If<-----------<< Exactly...
If wilder didn't get God involved he would have faired better
Thinking of your age and the way you speak like a young man makes me happy. Love and reapect
Yes it was Brilliant 👍😊
Love you, George, from a fan of Ali's. You wised up as you aged.  You and Ali used boxing as a platform (not an end) to reach millions of people, to teach us something. You've done it. I just wish L. Holmes gets wiser as you have. He seems to lurk in the past with all its bitter memories. You, my friend, have freed yourself. I can see Ali's picture behind you. You definitely have a lot of peace in your heat. This is a meta lesson I personally learned from you without you saying a word.  You too fought like a warrior and when you fell it was a legend just being humble and noble: legend while standing or otherwise is just a legend. Love again.
Love you George. Wish I could’ve watched the fight with you to have a legend explain history in the making!
Class Act
My grill short circuited.  Can you help ?
Totally agree about the ref
Thank you Mr. Foreman 🙂.
great work Champ good health to you!
What a great segment from such a legend. 🙏🏿
It was a great fight if you were a Fury fan.  If you were a DW fan it was painful to watch, frustrating, and disappointing.
Fury shut those Americans up, they clearly wanted their boy to win, but that fight settled it for good, fury was the better overall fighter.
💙💙💙  Just thought I'd stop by to say Hi to my favorite boxer of all time, George Forman!
Well Said Mr George Foreman.
Great man, great speech 💎
Sir, I simply love that grill. As for the recent fight, the fans won. Wilder showed heart during the contest. Fury woke up and made those later rounds really count. Meanwhile, Usyk is waiting in the shadows.
You the man. foreman"
George Foreman is a class act all the way.But in his heart of hearts he knows he could have beaten both of them.
Great fight !!!
Jack Johnson!!! He was the one who inspired Ali as far as show talking I bet....Jack is a legend!
You were my grandpa's favorite boxer but mine as well.  Best of health to you, Big George Foreman.
George you were one of the greats I bet you would have loved to fight tyson fury
george i have always been proud of you  quote a fan
My Foreman Grill still going string!
3:36 it seems like George forgot about the guy who he knock down 8 times in just 7 rounds
You simply cannot argue with Big George.
Slower counting from the referee and the bell saved fury. Fury did well though. He won the fight after he was dropped
That was the best explanation of what happened in this fight ive heard. No bias, no bull crap, just fact, and coming from a legendary fighter  who accepts that this trilogy and this fight was as good as any he had seen in any era,including his own..... his grills are decent too.
Wow!!! What humble affirmations from one of the last living legends of boxing. George Foreman is true heavyweight royalty, and his comments carry more clout than can be expressed. This gentleman isn’t just one of boxing’s greatest...he’s also one of Life’s champions. Love and respect from the UK 🇬🇧 🙏🏾🔥🔥💛
Thank you George for the great post fight commentary and for a stellar career and blessed life and beautiful family.
George, keep the videos coming. You are a national treasure.
Never thought I'd be able to thank George Foreman on his own channel.
Wilder needs to disappear for a while and think up some excuses! He’s a bad loser, I can’t stand him!
I wish I can end up as happy and peaceful in my later life as this man.
Yeah that was a great fight! Still the Lyle fight as far as the war goes was absolutely insane
Praise indeed if it’s praise from the great champ
Champ you need a mic that reduces your echo sounds like your in a hallway.
The legend himself speaks...one of the greatest heavyweight champion
Couldn't agree more with the Great George Forman
Love from England George  !  Living legend x
Good Evening sir From  India
What a humble man🥊
форману сразу лайк
Absolute legend and a good, good man.  One of the true titans of heavyweight boxing.  Maximum respect for the 🇬🇧.
Good points.. but I don't think the world will stop talking about Ali, Foreman, Frazier.
Mr Foreman will you compare the Wilder/Fury fight in historical terms equal to the Rumble in the Jungle?
Now that is something coming from George foreman
The big dosser did not give his superior his due.What a dosser.
I hate when people say “nobody lost”  Wilder got KTFO!
Best unbiased commentary I've seen!
George and Holyfield had one of the best fights I have ever seen I hope this man lives everyday with great health truly a legend ❤️
U are on point pops.
Great words from the legend... Kudos George....
You are a great Man Mr. Foreman, Respect. 🇺🇸
George has a YT Chanel. Okay okay. Ima sub. But bring me that 💯🔥   Fight was Amazing !!!
George! Tyson will always go the extra mile, respect to deontay for actually making it somehow to the 11th round, God only knows how he did it and fair play to him for that, he did pretty well tbh BUT it wasn't enough,  I'm upset with him that when tyson went to congratulate him and shake his hand for doing so well he didn't at the very least make peace with tyson and merely realise that the best man won,  deontay could learn a lot from tyson, it shouldn't have to end with bitterness.  Tyson is a lovely man that will help anyone.
big george  much love from sydney australia 🇦🇺
Epic George, Telling it like it IS!!!! George I think Wilder needs some lessons on balance. He needs new trainers. Wilder seems to wait to get hit by right hands like hes waiting for a bus. Fury looked very uncoordinated as always. Maybe Mike Tyson can beat Fury. Don King and his hair can come out of his retirement and call it Tyson Vrs Tyson.
Great fight, you need to love George forman.  Tyson Fury won, Deontay wilder finished second but got his respect back!
Tyson’s conditioning is as scary as his size in my opinion George , and to keep his pace after 2 knockdowns while keeping his head , Tyson is the most dangerous boxer on the planet , Almost unbeatable rate now.
The best part of the fight was when Tyson Fury gave glory to Jesus Christ, the king of kings and Lord of Lords!
Big George looking well and still looking strong.
George smashing YouTube ❤️
George Foreman what a gentleman a true boxing legend and really decent guy ......
wow... that words... that passion, this man is a legend beyond the ring.
I don't honestly know where George Foreman ranks in the greatest boxers of all-time, but George is without doubt Boxing's greatest ambassador and spokesman of my lifetime.  Truly a good guy and I wish George and his family the best.
Foreman vs Lyle is probably my favorite fight I believe today the way foreman went down face first the ref might have waved it off but he got up and eventually kod Lyle
Respect for the Big George Foreman. I agree with you champ.
Big George, nothing compares to your rumble with Ron. You are a all time great!!
You're the true greatest of all times..💜🤎🥊🥊
I agree with all that was said,   however.......  The physical conditioning of the heavyweights today,  absolutely stinks. The Ali's,  the Forman's,  The Tyson's,   the Holyfield's......  those guys looked like boxers,  they had the  physique of athletes.  Tyson Fury looks like a couch potato.  These modern day champs look  Pathetic.
It was like watching a rocky movie.
Well said, agree 💯
Big George, hello from Russia! All the best! Thank you
Legend
Bless you champ
Would he say the same thing if wilder won maybe.
Well said George, words of wisdom from one of the greatest boxer ever
We love you George! Legend!
Hey Big George happy to see you got your own channel. Massive fan here
That s all you GAAT GEORGE
People will never stop talking about you George, or Ali. Great fight tho!
I feel so much respect for you George, great man, great boxer, great grill. That fight was very exciting, and Wilder showed so much heart, I thought Wilder was done in the sixth round, but he managed to endure until the eleventh. I agree with you George about the referee, it was one of the best I've ever seen.
We wana see a movie of Foreman.
Hi big George! Your fight with Ron Lyle still the most extraordinary heavyweight brawl EVER! Wilder proved how much he had improved, but fury getting up after that first big right hand from wilder was amazing! They are both great fighters. But sad that wilder wouldn’t talk to fury after the fight. I remember when you were served the biggest robbery in boxing history when you hammered Shannon Briggs! But you were graceful and wished Briggs well. And you were ROBBED! Wilder lost fair and square yet wouldn’t show fury respect. Oh and by the way, we will NEVER stop talking about YOU and your AMAZING FIGHTS. THE LEGEND LIVES FOREVER! 💥🥊
Mr Foreman i miss guy's like you Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Great analysis by one of the greatest ever do it 🥊🥊🥊
Prime George would knock both these out in the same night.
cmon George, you don't have to be so kind. We all know you would beat them both :D
Who wins George  or Fury?
Right from the mouth of living legend himself
Great point about the refereeing. Thank you Mr Foreman!
Best dressed podcaster on the whole internet. This man is a legend!
Well said Big George!
Why have I not know King George had a channel!!!! Subbed!!
Muhammad Ali was the greatest. But George Foreman was (is) the best.🥊. Thanks
Fucking living legend. Humble and classy
Wilder : i know i can put him down Fury : i know i can get up
DON'T GET THE GENE THERAPY SHOT
Honestly even Deontay didn't really lose last night since he showed that he's a legitimate contender which people doubted after the previous fight
Omg such an honour to see you Sir
Amazing fight, amazing commentary of one of the greatest
Train by the great Archie Moore.
Could not agree more , well said George, alot of people will talk about this fight ,but none as prescise and correct as u,well done 👍
It's hard to believe but both Fury and Wilder dwarfs Big George by 14 and 8 centimeters, respectively.
I just wish DW could have been a better loser .
1:59 “I’m just so happy I lived long enough to see the past come alive again.” What a great way to compliment the two fighters and celebrate your work in the sport. You’re an all time great George, and we’re happy for your health and great attitude
We love you George, I didn’t know you had a YouTube channel, I just subscribed. Talk to someone about a different mic setup, we need to hear you crystal clear champ!
I am feel. I am very feel after hearing this
George you are a legend!!!
I love you George Foreman you are a complete legend from my youth and Childhood,,always saw you as a total gentleman,I love your analysis Sir and  Thankyou much respect and lov3e fo4 you and your family 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧🇺🇸❤️
Great shout out to the referee, George.
100 percent class
WE LOVE YOU GEORGE
Greetings Big George and well said.
George in short went from growing up in the projects and running from the cops in Houston to a  christian man and preacher,to a great boxer and human being to match.
Wow.. just wow.. I felt like you were talking too me.. what an amazing overview of the fight.. 👌🥊💙👌🥊💙👌
Doesn't matter if you fought hard, you still lost. That is the way it is.
Foreman is the KING of boxing 🥊my favorite boxer.
Anyone else watching this thinking about lean mean grilling machines?
Yeah great to see two fighters that come to fight and not pussy around like so many others .
HW Royalty
Thanks George
Mr Foreman, big hug from Croatia!
Mr. Foreman you are a legend and a good man.  Your carefully chosen words prove that. Much respect.
George you are my favorite heavy weight of all time. I loved you style...tenacity....heart. You the best.....
I'm a Ali fan, but George is the GOAT. 20 years after winning it once, he won it again.
Just a shame they had those special lights that shined into Wilders eyes 👀 during the fight. Or whatever excuse he comes up with.
Gorge IAM the best fight Prodicter of all times!!!! And i have YOU and Lennox Lewis beating Tyson Fury  in your prime  !!!! iam sure in the late rounds Mayby   7__10         EX-PRO Boxer Founder of Boxing vs UFC and best fight PREDICTOR of all times Rocky the Eastern Assassin !!!!!!!! Esterline!!!!!
Anyone who hasn’t seen Foreman vs Lyle do yourself a favor and go watch that fight. One of the craziest fights of all time.
Thank you mr. Foreman
Nice one, George. Always love a Jack Johnson shout out!
Well said Mr. Foreman, true World Champion!
Well said to George like your take..
Well said George I never saw you as I'm to young but my dad speaks highly of you
Even here in France we miss your commenting. Always been a fan. Big George is one of the smartest analyse machine of heavyweights fights. Cheers from Paris ! You got a lot of fans here
Wilder keep going my man ! 3 wins and you’re back in the Title talks. Utilize the body shots and keep boxers guessing. You can tell Fury was confused the first couple of rounds. Wish Wilder kept the body then the 1-2. Wilder will be back,he lost to the greatest HW in recent history. Nothing to be upset about. KEEP WORKING WILDER
I remember your fight with Ron Lyle, very similar to this one.
Congrats to Tyson fury, and deontay Wilder have heart, dude is not a quieter.
George we love you from England
Superb words from a great!
Some head movement and feints from Wilder things would've  been  different..but  still a very good fight...
God bless you george
Box legende Mr.bone crasher
I have to agree George well said, what a tough fight, Wilder was great, I'm glad the ref stopped it because he was just too blurry, and you can do brain damage if you continue like that. Tyson did a good job too. But your comments are right on the money thanks for chiming in
Big George! ❤
hey George who took longer to come out, wilder last night or you in the rumble in the jungle?  i never knew u had a channel.  your looking very well champ.
Much love for Big George but this fight was NOT great by a long shot! George knows what boxing is and this was nothing in fact none of the matches were legit boxing contests. Neither  man can actually box...they stand flat footed, low guards, no telegraphed punches, no slips, no footwork. This isn't the art and science of boxing...just a slugfest hoping to land a bomb. We learned from Kimbo Slice just because a man is big and muscular doesn't make you a boxer. This was far from 'GREAT' it was trash. But this is all we have for heavyweight.
The only thing I would disagree with is, the referee gave too many warnings to Tyson without taking a point. However, what the ref did that was good was, he didn't let Tyson stay on Wilder long, but the cumulation benefitted Tyson. Had the ref taken a point, perhaps we would have seen an even better fight. Nonetheless, congratulations to the winner.
Thanks for your grill George it's a great product I use every day, love from UK 🇬🇧
How amazing! George only looks 50... Clever man!
We are blessed to have you among is with your knowledge, sharp brain and humor George. After all the punces you have recieved there is not a trace ♥️
My Respect to a true sporting icon. Mr foreman.
Hello George from a fellow kind old guy in Idaho....lol...Big Fan....May God continue to Bless you...and thanks for being such an inspiration ....you smile and happiness are the best!!!!
George the bone crasher...
Wow you have a you tube channel......... Bloooooooooooooooming love you George............... Much love from Scotland big man.
Great review by a Great Champion.
George all love from uk 🇬🇧❤️
Absolutely love it from George right here, great passion for boxing, past, present and future   Great words from an all time great
George Foreman A Living Legend!
Great to see people praising a great performance by the referee
RIGHT ON CHAMP !! SURE MISS YOU IN THAT SQUARED CIRCLE AND BEHIND THE MIC 🎤 ONE OF BOXING'S GREATEST BIG GOERGE FOREMAN!!!!!
A great statement from great champion and  legend ! to another great and current champion and king of the heavyweight division For now at least ! Well done T-fury  👍👌
I can't believe the Great George Foreman is on youtube and im subscribed to his channel. Thank you sir you are a living Legend🙏
Always speaks sense George , great man weren’t a bad fighter either , Top man champ
George Foreman's  power of speech is obout equal to his punching power!
Didnt know mr foreman had a channel. This is great!
The problem with calling this a great fight is that the result was barely ever in doubt. Wilder won 3 0f the 11 rounds and and after the 4th round, was out on his feet. The writing was on the wall and even though Wilder showed guts, he was completely outclassed…
Good coment george 🥊💪
Thank you for that great perspective!
Legene
Steel fury. Tyson is still in tiger1 .wait till Tyson gets to become tiger2.King Tiger panther tank.
Thank you Mr George's for your wise view
GEORGE IS SO FREAKIN HUMBLE
Great job George on your very insightful opinion! I fully agree it was a great action packed fight, one for the history books for sure! George Foreman, you have always conducted yourself with a high degree of class & respect not only for Boxing, but all people as well. You are the epitome of how a Heavyweight Champion should conduct himself in & outside the ring. You are a gracious & most righteous man, and I wish more fighters would conduct themselves with the level of class you do.
The Referee deserves an award !! Best referee I have seen in ages
Well said George, respect..
Well said. Champ
Love my George Forman grill 👍 the frank bruno toaster on the other hand 🤦‍♂️ knackered after 2 rounds
Thank you Mr Foreman. Enough respect man..
Get a better sound George to much echo
What a great speech, nothing but the upmost respect for the great of the past and the present 🙏🏾🥊2021
You're a legend George . Respect from the UK 👍
I hope Mister Foreman reads his comments. I want to remind him how far he has come. From a merciless bully putting bloodied victims  in the  hospital to a man of God with the love of Christ in his heart. You see, I was at Job Corps center in 1965 at Alameda County jail compound  in Pleasanton, Ca. I personally helped take those bloody unconscious victims of George from their bunks to the ambulance. He was a monster. Amazing grace….
Great analysis by George!.....no one is better equipped to describe this fight!!!
Nothing but respect big George you been there plenty of times this was one of the greatest heavyweight championship of the world amazing boxing match two warriors and one Gypsy  King
always a class act!
Great  to hear your comments on fight George. Everybody should sit up and listen coming from yourself 🥊boxing royalty.
RESPECT TO YOU MR FOREMAN AS WELL AS BEING A GREAT FIGHTER YOU BECAME A GREAT HUMAN BEING. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE PLEASURE YOU HAVE GIVEN FIGHT FANS OVER THE YEARS. WISHING YOU AND YOUR FAMILY  ALL THE LOVE AND HAPPINESS YOU DESERVE.👑👑👑👑
If Foreman says it.
Well said, Mr. Foreman!
The Legend <3.
Wish you all the best champ, great to see you are doing well!!!   One of the all time greatest boxers doing videos for his own youtube channel, I can‘t believe it :D
One of the greatest heavyweight fights of all time for sure deonte the bronze bomber Wilder versus Tyson and Gypsy King fury it was knocked down after knockdown it was man getting up after man getting up and it was no final bill to decide who the winner was in the end the fight ended buy KO Tyson fury being the victor even though I'm a deonte Wilder fan and I'm truly grateful to have witness such an amazing heavyweight championship fight 💯🔥🔥🔥🥊🤔💡💯🥊✔️
George is so classy 😎👍
Respect Mr Foreman.
Even at 72 years old and the brutal fights Foreman was a part of, he speaks and looks so sharp! Masha Allah :) God bless you George!
Greetings from Poland 🇵🇱
Mr. George Foreman you are an outstanding boxer/person and I love you more than my two George Foreman Fat Reducing Grilling Machines.
What about the wilder rabbit punches AGAIN ? none called by the ref!
Livin' Legend Big George  I stood up at night with my Dad to see you boxing and all the other Legends of this Decade....your are one of the best ever,great Champion,Sportsmwn and Personalitie.....God or whoever bless you !
Great words from a legend God bless you George
This channel is back alive..... I want it to stay that way
George you are not only one of my favorite fighters of All Time, You are one of my Favorite Men. God Bless.
Pure class.
that awkward moment George Foreman want us to forget *the rumble in the jungle*
today,s fight reminds me of your fight with Ron Lyle..Any other fighter and wilder would have decimated him..
What a treat to find your channel Big George.
Hello George; love your're coments  on the fight. Can't wait to see the undisputed heavyweight champion fight between Fury vs Usyk!!!. You are right, boxing is back like the old days. Blessings champ.  From P.R. René.
I dont know how many times i have watched george v ron lyle bout,that was probably the best slug match to date,big up,big george
THATS WHAT i SAID ABOUT THE REFEREE TOO :)
Легенда
The inimitable George Foreman ! What a man ! xxxxxxx
By all respect to Big George but that wasn’t good boxing match at all….Fury had a worst performance of his pro career by far wich made a Wilder looks strong…..Fact…
From the mouth of a Hall of Fame boxing Legend. music to my ears. After having my opinion about the second fight. Tyson Fury clearly came out in this third fight and put hands all over the bronze bomber and claim the victory
one who is mentally and physically strong he is the winner n that shown by Tyson furry n he is the king of king the gypsy king.
George Foreman the knockout machine
Thank YOU George XOXOXOOXOX
Definitely give both fighters credit all heart from both of them! Also a huge George Foreman fan like Ali said no one hits as hard as George Foreman!
Great words, from one of the legends. Wilder deserves some redemption for his performance tonight. Tyson Fury moves ahead into the legendary heavyweight champions of all the era's.
Mr George God is great all the time! God bless you and your family… toujours la grande classe
Your fight against Ron Lyle was a greater slugfest George.
He didn't get counted out
My respect 🙏
Mr. Foreman I'm happy to hear from you
🥊Say Cousin George... [Phillips]
My favourite heavyweight of all time. Big George vs Lyle was one hell of a fight.
My prayers for you
It's always nice to hear you speak George , one of my favourite boxing legends
Джордж здоровья вам.
My sporting hero right here. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿✌️
It was indeed a great fight but Wilder like Lewis used to point out with Mike Tyson, one dimensional. Wilder is missing a lot with that right hand of his but it was a great fight
السلام عليكم جورج فورمان جريت مان
George would have whooped em both!
Big George please do more like this.... I wish you did something like this for Josuah vs Usyk
Great words spoken from a boxing legend.  Thanks champ
Mr Foreman....Sir you are a legend.
The Legend
Thank You Sir George ! Glad you saw it Also ! Been on HotBoxin ???
Thanks for your kinds words George
I love you big George but this was not a great fight maybe a competitive fight but not a great fight.
Bit of an echo but still nice to hear from Mr. Foreman.
With Christ Mr Foreman. Regards from Poland.
What a humble guy George. You tha man. Love seeing you talk. Great fight indeed.
A great fight and good point about the reffing. He wasn’t breaking up the clinch prematurely and letting both men work inside and was strict on fouls. Beautiful fighting and great reffing equals an all-time classic.
Love & enjoyed the trilogy fight today 💖 Always love you George, my ideal & great inspiration 🥊💖☺️
George do you regret accusing ali of drugging your water?
What a great fight it was Champ...I thought we'd never see the likes of a match like this again. I miss the days when the giants would step into the ring ( including yourself ) and would give us a show to remember for life. Yep, those two worriers gave the customers what they came to see....and that was a FIGHT TO REMEMBER.
Damn Mr. Foreman got a YouTube channel, niceee! You're Looking great Mr Foreman. Much respect from The Netherlands Mr. Foreman 💞
Fury is "that one" to Wilder. They say God put one on Earth for everyone. Long as Fury knows that (he seems to) he'll stay sharp. Good fight!
That really was a great fight...both guys definitely earned their money.
I will always thank you for the grill.
Much love champ!
Well said sir, and many happy years ahead for you. Remember your fights so well. Tony in UK.
Wow coming from a living legend wow
Above all none of 'em    Could take ur right swing during ur time!!
Love big George. Much respect.
Pure legend big george foreman lethal puncher heavy hands ....
The fight was decided on skill versus power. I said Fury would win despite him being a cheater. He can box. Until Wilder develops his boxing chops and stops relying on his right hand his repertoire will be severally limited.
Well said George!!!!! Well said!!!
Happy to have you on youtube Mr. Foreman! Your perspective on all things boxing is essential.
Could you imagine what George would do to Wilder. It would be sad. But in no way was this a great title match. Outside of a round and a half, Wilder got his ass beat the whole fight. It was not even close in my opinion. Now as far as suspense as if Wilder could have landed the punch it could have been a great fight
George , good analysis with your insight . Your comment on the good job the referee did was on point . The fight reminded me of your fight with Ron Lyle back in 1975 .
Still one of my top 5 boxers ever ! We will always talk about you George ! You are an amazing human ! Big up from England big man 💯❤️🇬🇧
Foreman Moore was one of the best title matches of all time.
You my fav boxer with Ali and Like
You have so much passion for boxing George, you were a legendary warrior and champion in the ring. So glad to hear from you sir.
George, you're great at this commentary, but too modest.  We'll never stop talking about "down goes Frazier",  the Rumble, and Moorer.  Yes, Fury is special, but you're talking about forgetting greatness.
One of the greatest of all times
Always a class act mr Foreman. I bow to you
Big G! Speaking the facts as always! We need to see you on commentary sir! Sending you love all the way from the UK! 🥊❤️
Since you are one person who would directly interacted with Sonny Liston and knows what kind of man he was can you make a video on how he was In real life, cz he seems to be really misunderstood by the boxing world.. it would be good if you could share your experience with him
Miss you George!
George..ded you love Mohamed Ali ,,,
A fighter talking about a fight. George your comments are worth a million comments from talking heads that never stood toe to toe in the ring. The winner won and in this fight the loser made very hard on him. It could have gone either way depending on the wind.
I don't see Joshua beating fury either anytime soon.
Good job Mr Foreman.. room for improvement in the sound quality, echoes, and add a sidekick to break the monotony of a long dialogue... Your experience, stature, and wisdom, deserves a better production... Best of luck Mr Foreman
Wilders mask must have weighed 50 pounds,that's why he lost.😁 Fury is clearly the best heavyweight in years now.
class knows class,end of story.
great views George foreman
*Tyson Fury is the modern GOAT!* I truely believe that he would out box any fighter past or present. He has the size, the reach, the speed, the footwork, the skill, and he can fight in numerous different styles; and sub styles of both offence and defence.  Lastly, the ref did a phenomenal job in just letting the fighters fight! Unlike Kenny Bayliss who constantly broke them up whenever Fury got the upper hand, and never let them work and deducted points from Fury, and never warned Wilder for hitting the back of the head in every clinch.
I am so impressed in this comment. Great comment from a great man.
George you're a legend and still the hardest hitter in heavyweight history
Somebody get uncle George a good mic
I like you too much. Thank you for your comment.
Yoooooo
Не понимаю по-английски, но счастлив видеть Формана!
Thanks George always a pleasure. Was happy to hear you mention how good the referee was in this fight.
great comments George, as always
Great war. Credit to both men.  I'm a huge Fury fan. I was worried by Wilders crazy power. So relieved to see him pull it out in the 11th
will never stop talking about george foreman and muhammad ali
Gigantes Wilder y Fury pero usted le ganaba a los 2 juntos Mr. Foreman
Well said Big George Foreman, well said... Shalum ✊🏾💚
WILDER is a bum.. Period.
Love ya George.  It was an absolutely amazing fight.  I loved it.  As a Fury fan, I’m proud of Wilder’s display of heart and think he has nothing to be ashamed of.  I hope he leaves the excuses out of this one.   God bless, George.  You’ll always be the Champ in my book.
God bless you Foreman
Great
The looser was Americans.  But we seem to be loosing a lot lately.  Mr. Wilder, terrific effort!
Well said, Mr. Foreman. I agree with everything that you've said. I know that this gets thrown around too easily today, but you're a good man. You're a good man because you've got a good heart filled with God.
Thank you George, always a pleasure to see you. Kind regards from the Netherlands.
Damn he’s looking good for his age looks a bit Chinese
I haven't watched a ton of live boxing matches but this was definitely the most entertaining boxing match i have ever seen live. I'm willing to listen to anything you have to say on here George. Don't be shy! Put more videos up of whatever is on your mind!
They fired George from commentating. Stupid
The Rev is so Right on . Fury..Amazing.... Wilder Just gets better and better..Two of the greatest Heavies ever. No one really lose..This fight will be remembered forever..Hope Wilder keeps boxing 🥊.
George you are truly a icon and truly respected
Love you George and I love your channel keep it up is there any one That can beat Tyson fury
Twitter people be calling the match rigged because they don't know what's good other than onlyfans.
No sign of CTE.Incredible
top marks bro
George where did you get the shirt you were wearing in your last video?
NEWS FLASH! WILDER IS NOT A REAL BOXER, MY POINT WAS PROVEN LAST NIGHT. THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT
One Of The Greatest.
Love this kind of video, thanks champ 🙏🏻
Thanks George , Great Channel

Big George beet Fury,Joshua,Wilder. Great puncher all time.
The losers were the ones who bet on Wilder lol
Hi Big George!! I'm a huge fan from Sri Lanka!! You're a legend sir!!
Great Fight George. Miss your commentating.
Thanks George for the video always a pleasure to listen to one of the greatest boxers ever and one of the best human stories I’ve ever heard of
Hola George
