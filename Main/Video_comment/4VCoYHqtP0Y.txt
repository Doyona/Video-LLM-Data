I'm having second-hand embarrassment when Ryland goes as Mom or Mama. I'm not being critical ❤ but for me personally, I want to be called Dad. Just bc im a gay man and have a child, I don't wanna be called Mama. Idk I just feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. 😳
Man oh man... that cinnamon roll 😋 😍 recipe📒 looks easy nuf to try.
Oh my gosh, those boys are adorable! I used to watch Shane and Ryland all the time growing up, and I had no idea Ryland had his own channel—how did I miss that?! I know I’m super late to the party, but wow… you have twins now?! What a gorgeous family. Huge congratulations to you both!
Shane’s cooking segment is giving food videos and I’m obsessedddd
its so crazy to have watched shane go from shanaynay to a husband and father in real time. <3
so cute
Jet looks like Shane and Max looks like Ryland ❤
Can I have the name of the pillow where you feed them?❤
Shane I love you but it kind of pissed me off when you said you were making dinner and then the scene comes you're cooking sweet Hawaiian rolls I really wanted to see you cooking something like a real good dinner
This is making me miss the time when my twins were babies. They are FIVE now. I have no choice but to accept this.
I honestly appreciate that you guys aren't exploiting your sons' childhood for views. We, internet strangers/viewers are AWARE of them, but I really like that you don't make them the center subject of your videos/vlogs. If you think from your own perspective, I'm sure you wouldn't prefer to have your entire babyhood + childhood documented for the world to see. Your sons deserve that privacy & I think you're doing a good job with that. & no offense to Shane, just wanted to mention/commend that Ryland is doing a great job taking care of them. ❤❤ they will thank you in the future for NOT documenting every blow-out they had, etc 😂 (normal BTW; my son had blow-outs several times a day when he was 2 months old up to 6 months or so) I also did pride myself in breastfeeding/made sure I ate WHATEVER possible to increase my breastmilk, so that's part of it 😂
The staring at the pictures for “2 hours 😭” I was not expecting the ending 😂😂
the way i have to watch old videos because im all caught up on you and shane’s
Some babies can go places at any time and they adjust accordingly. Some are very resilient in that sort of sense. Both of my boys were entirely reliant on staying with schedule for eating, napping, and bed. It was a pretty fast lesson. Anytime we would have company or a family gathering for holidays, we would wind ip paying for the mismanaged routine in dividends…precious precious sanity and sleep. So, I got very comfortable with the fact that if I couldn’t fit a plan into nap time then it didn’t happen that day. My boys are 5.5 years apart too btw. They do great on schedules still. I feel like the routine made them more cooperative and resilient little humans as they grow too. My youngest is learning to tell time now he is 5, but prior to that, all they have to know what it coming is the consistency that you bring to the table.
rewatching old videos, the babies were sooooo littleeeee😭😭
the nighttime and bath time routine were so cute, it makes me want a baby!!
I can’t be watching these bc of my baby fever !!! Y’all are a cute couple and have a beautiful family!!!😭😭💖
2:19 okay but i honestly never even thought ab how much goes into the podcast like we just see it and it looks seamless and beautiful while behind the scenes it’s a crazy mess that probably only chris understands so props to chris😭
U did great Shane ! Just put it up higher rack in the oven so the bottom doesn’t burn u know ? ❤❤❤ love your babies u2 !
That's not cooking shane 😂
Are they only drinking milk?  Or are these formulated ?
I just love how much you both matured and grown so much. I’m proud! as someone who watched you in my high school/ middle school days. This heals me! ❤
They should be drinking formula at this age
No cow milk or goat milk until they're 1 year old
Conspiracy Cooking w Shane ❤🎉😂
We all love Hawaiian rolls too
I’m sure you guys already figured this out by now, but if not- they make suspender clips for baby sheets!!! I use them religiously now and it makes me less paranoid of the sheet coming loose. Y’all are doing so awesome dads 🥹🩷
Where did you guys buy that galaxy projector i need one for my son
i hope their skins didn’t dry out being bathed every day!
Both your content is the only thing I watch that makes me laugh out loud, yous are like funny fun uncles for me honestly, love it 😂💜
I would honestly live and love to watch Ryland learning to cook series
not so up n close
ppl in hollywood eat babies dont make them look like that
dont post ur babies crotch guys
I’d love to try to watch them come to stay Louis see how long they last
You know I love you guys but must be nice being able to brag about sheets
Shane! The T-Shirt you have on. I want one. I have a crazy Dobi boy. I love the shirt. Can you comment where u got it? I’m a longggg time viewer.
You two are the most amazing parents ❤. Those boys are very blessed to have such loving parents
your vlogs will forever bring me serotonin x 100000
Ryland your nursery is amazing and you’re such a good mom and I love watching you with them and all you do for your family  great video! ❤❤❤❤
Love love love this video I kept it ❤❤❤❤
It feels like Ryland does everything for the babies and Shane does the bare minimum
I think its funny how shane picked out the name jet and ryan had to have it as jetson instead, but jet for short yet he always calls him jetson since watching Ryans channel i have noticed how he always needs to have it his way so it doesnt surprise me that shane doesnt get to do more with the boys wish Shane still had his own channel!
Please do another one now that the boys are older I wish yall made more coy with the boo
You’re a good dad, Ryland. Quick question: do they get donated breast milk or just the animal milk?
I hope you guys know you four have an army behind you!!! A family from the distance always
I'm confused... how is goat's milk not dairy? Dairy is milk that comes from mother animals
Made your cinnamon rolls.  Delicious ❤
Goat milk for a 3 month old can be very dangerous. 😢
evil shane ryland
Just had to comment to send my LOVE AND HAPPINESS to your babies 💖💖💖!!! I know we are strangers, but you and your babies have SO MUCH support from us 💖.  — sincerely,  everyone who loves you over the internet
“Was it supposed to be regular sized and you messed it up” 🤣
I been here since early Shane Dawson and I love it
shane cooking😅 i missed this human
It’s not made from scratch you literally just melted butter and mixed in cinnamon
Who the fuck allowed sh*ne to have a child??????
save them babies
A baby isn’t meant to be raised in that environment, it should be illegal
You’re not parents, you need a mom for that
I loved this video so so much! Thanks for sharing your beautiful boys with us!!❤❤  And I felt so bad when Shane was sad over his cinnamon rolls. But I loved watching Shane doing something alone like OG Shane shenanigans.  Lol And Ryland ! You act SO cute with the boys.  😢❤
Im a chef, Shane is 100% right. You literally just go with it.   This is the most me thing ive ever seen.
Shane what udescribed about ur heart whdn u wokd up is caused by anxiety ive experienced it, uts scary 😮😅
Id love to see a full cooking show xD
How does it make sence that one baby doesnt tolarete dairy so you give him goat milk? Goat milk is still DAIRY
Shane didnt cook he put cinamon on alredy made bread.... he loves lieing
It was 4 months ago but feeding them while they are on their back is really bad. They dont activate their lower jaw so it doesnt develop cause the milk goes down with gravity and not with their force.
yes i love knowing placements of the baby cribs and everything about em! so cuteeeee!
Now it's not just Ryland leaving poopies on the floor
I was wondering about the cribs 110%😂❤
Wow u can see who the wife is doing all the work 😂 Beautiful babies ❤
Love this content !! Yessssss🩵🩵the boys are so cuteeee , so nice to see u guys as parents , you guys are doing amazing !!
Because I don't want anything to happen to your babies ... Please do more research on cow milk vs formula ... "Before your child is 12 months old, cow's milk may put him or her at risk for intestinal bleeding. It also has too many proteins and minerals for your baby's kidneys to handle and does not have the right amount of nutrients your baby needs."
I love when Jett & Max are on the vlog! I know that you guys were hesitant about having them on but I think the way you’re doing it is perfect!
You had to pay a woman to lend you her body because you guys would have never gotten through the adoption vetting process.
ryland did everything by himself in this video?
What did you think of the ending?
Hi Ryland! I’ve been watching you for like 4+ years now. And I just found out I am expecting twins!! I know so crazy! I was just looking through all your videos to get some ideas and information and products you guys use. Can you please tell me what stroller you use for both of them. It seems hard to find a stroller where you can put both car seats in.  Please respond, thank you! MUCH LOVE 🤍
Ommmmmgggg hoooowwww cuuteeee thank you for letting us see his little face !!!!!! Omg 😭😭❤❤
the crying over the Winnie the Pooh overalls is MEEEEEE
How do you decide on the final cut for a video like this?
I had cereal for dinner.
love the way you film them without really filming them, but omg they're sooooooo cute !!!
How long have you been following this channel? I just discovered it!
Has anyone met the creator?
It’s moments like these that remind me there are still good people in the world.
If you come across this, please send your prayers and positive energy. I’ve been battling health issues for years.
How was the background music synchronized with the video scenes?
You’re not suppose to bathe them every single day. You wash away the skin's natural protective oils and bacteria, which can help keep babies healthy.
you guys are such good dads!
Ryland is a great parent
Ryland has it down! I have twins, single mom, and I know how hard it is to get them on the same schedule. Job well done!
Has anyone met the creator?
You guys should do one of those awkward photo shoots on the stool in the boys room
Do you use baby formula milk ?
34:20 , WE BOTH GOT EXCITEDD!! THATS WHAT HE SAID!!😂😂🎉❤
28:18 , had to cover my eyes because my diabetic genes started acting up (not diabetic yet...)
21:48 !! 😂😂😂 I STARTED CRACKING UP , "With this f*cking noggin!!" 😂😂😂❤❤
17:00 , 😂😂😂 after watching that Christmas episode yesterday,  I went straight to the store to make cinnamon rolls..... I burned them too!!! 😭😭😭 I forgot them in the oven!!
12:30 , what sunglasses does Shane have? They are so cute!! I need to get myself a pair.... oh wait I wear glasses...
Seeing Shane's reaction to Ryland loving the cinnabites he made was genuinely so heartwarming 🥺😍 like you can really see just how well they know each other and how much they care about each other 🥺❤️
Hey all the way from Aussie land!!  Even though I've only bn watching you 2 & the rest of yr group for a few months now with the way you both communicate to yr fans it actually makes me feel like part of the family!! You both are so incredibly funny & you both put me in hysterics with laughter with yr comedic sayings & with the way u Shayne makes those faces it's so funny & well done!! You both are so very brave & courageous for posting yr life & including yr friends & family not only the funny times but the sad as well, you & entourage show us yr both aren't just celebrities of the internet world but are also a loving, caring, kind, wholesome American family, who have so much to give & the drive to help others in need wen ever & where ever they can!!

Oh & I just love Rylands grandma is it I saw in the post where you all went to the haunted bridge, she was the smartest one of the bunch of u I reckon for staying home, even though I'm into all of that as well but you wouldn't catch me going to any haunted place u don't know who or wat you'll bring back with u, good thinking grandma I'm with you!!!👍Anyway enough from me for now, but I will like to say thank u for getting me thru covid just now, I missed it all these yrs & boom it got me damn it!! Hey just a thought by watching how u both interact with each other, I know we have just to many of these pod casts & shows of this as it is, but wats one more huh, have you thought Shayne of doing a cooking show but not like the others sumthing different, I just loved the pod cast u did with the cinnamon buns u were dong for Ryland, that was soooooooo funny I couldn't stop laughing!! U probably already have I guess, & provably just don't have the time hey!! Hope u do decide on sumthing with that please keep us posted anyway if anything new on the horizon!!  Not sure if you will have the time to read this, soory for the long comment here but I do hope it gets to you & at least puts a smile on yr dials!!

Everyone deserves sum peace & joy in this world & I'm so happy it has reached u both with those 2 twin boys of yrs CCONGRATS on yr new family!!!!👨‍❤‍💋‍👨👨‍👨‍👧‍👦🥂
Watching these, you are giving me baby fever. Even thought I’m 20 and single 😂
watching this is so weird because i watched shane for YEARS growing up, since like day 1. and were raising twins at the same time! my twins are the same age omg!! and we both have boys!
Lmfao literally thought of GloZell before you said her nameee😂😂😂
Hey Ryland! On the patio were the boys just watching outside, I was thinking if u added a flower to attract a butterfly 🦋 and a hummingbird feeder.. just a thought
As a mum of 5 who always let their babys sleep in the bouncer threw the day it makes a huge difference for night time in their cots I found they knew from day time naps to night time sleep ❤
Sick
Me just studying the babies trying to figure out who they look like most wondering who the bio dad is or is there one of each. How cool. It'll be easier to tell as they get older. I know you guy's said it doesn't matter but when they're older it might be super obvious.
13:22 shouldn’t babies be given formula milk until 1 years then can be introduced to cow or other milk due to complications associated with it. Not hating genuinely concerned.
Awww to cute 😭❤ you guys r 100% my favourite yt family. Shane’s been my fav YouTuber for years and years. 😭 SHANE! OMG THE ROLLS LOOK SO GOOD BUT AW. No that’s so sad that they burned.. 😔 win in the end? SHANE 100% try AGAIN!
Its so amazing seeing this, ive been a fan since the old days (im 30 and i remember watching Shane almost right after yt first started when i was in hs) You all are really wonderful parents and have gone through so much in life while still being Internet sensations..Max and Jet are the luckiest babies! All the fans esp the day ones, we love to see videos like this ♥️♥️
All I'm saying is that Ryland was right and Shane didn't really cooked lol
Okay, i know im waayy late. But i want to see shane transition from this easy baking to from scratch baking. That would be a fun journey for him to learn to cook delicious meals and treats and as they boys get older they can learn with him.
33:20  FOR FUCKING WHAT RYLAND ?!?! NOT EVERYDAMN FUCKING THING NEEDS TO BE IN A FUCKING PICTURE OF FUCKING VIDEO
19:23  this one FOR SURE has to be Shane’s sperm to egg baby 😂🥺
The way you stick to the routine is amazing!  I love it!  I wish I could do the same 🥴.   This makes me feel like I really need to get it together with my babes.   Shane’s cooking segment took me out! “Who’s texting me? Oh it’s Gordon Ramsey, he’s shook!” 😂
They are adorable!! 🥰
Considering you didn’t have a recipe and just winged it it’s not bad just cut the cook time down to like 12-15mins not 20 mins
Aww honestly I love this for y’all ❤
But i remember Shane and Ryland only had one baby boy
OMG YA'LL ARE SO STINKIN CUTE I'M LIVING FOR PARENT ERA😍😭💕
Aww he's so adorable.  You guys are such good parents. I just love seeing these videos. ❤❤❤❤
As a mama I just keep my child off line. That’s my personal preference…. However I think watching yall got a good balance… camera isn’t shoved in their faces.
I feel some ppl with no social jobs get bored then want babies as toys
Where did u get the stars on the ceiling? Is it a projector? Thank uuu
Made from scratch? lol…
From dallas Texas you'll job's its not easy at all take you. Appreciate  it very much. Love You'll outfits shoes it's looks great and you'll have a beautiful family and fury babies. Tinkerbell and sassy said that love You'll. Video and appreciate everything's doing for everyone there tv Tinkerbell and sassy said that appreciate you'll both. Video   and appreciate youtube channel appreciate. Fantastic  job on YouTube channel..... congratulations on.    Being  new. Daddy's.
Now creeps can make deepfakes of your baby
Why y’all lowkey fine
Omg my son is 4onths so crazy how are babies are almost the same age
I'm so proud of you Shane 🎉
really love this vlog and how it was made and the way it was edited to portray the babies but also Shane and Ryland ❤ love yall
“And the way that the cinnamon has crystallized” SHANES FACEEEEE I CANNOTTTTTT
sometimes you focus on looking for the best angle too much when im mostly wanting to be apart of the experience of whats happening, aside from hearing you say it looks bad and Shane saying who cares. A majority of the time i just want the real experience and i dont mind the angles or positions you think are bad. Not hating on you, do your thang , im still going to watch.
Ryland seems like a single parent.
I looooove this type of vlog. More of theeese!!
Dont feed them laying on their backs like that
one thing i noticed in this, was the walk around 12 mins in, where like, they are taking turns pushing the stroller, which is honestly just so cute and like they clearly are sharing the responsibility of the babies
The kfc chicken pizza looks more like a chicken parmi (parmigiana) with a pepperoni on top
A routine is essential for babies & new parents!
Shane Dawson: plooping and dumping in the kitchen since ‘88
This is just lovely to see, I am emotional and laughing at the jokes
I LOVEEE Jerid & Sandy!! big love from the UK guys your doing amazing
1) It was a bad idea watching this on an empty stomach.  😂 2) Thanks Shane 4 the amazing recipe idea. 3) The boys are sooooo cute. 4) ❤ the blog, Ryland.  ❤❤❤❤ watching y’all a lot and congratulations on the boys. And Shane, cooking isn’t easy, but it can be if u make it fun. That’s how my dad and great grandma taught me how 2 cook.
Ah...times before the 4 month sleep regression :-P 😅 But also dont listen to me I'm just bitter because I have a 20 month old who stil wakes up 2-3 times a night. Totally get having a strict scheudule Especially for twins. But...that is not going to guarentee 'sleeping through the night'. But, fingers crossed you get lucky, at least for one of them!
❤❤❤
I’d love to see some cooking videos from Shane learning new recipes he’s never tried.
Wait are you guys really giving the babies goat and cow milk?
Shane, you look great!!!
I choked when Shane said should I cry chicken should I try to burn down the house 😂
Look at him kicking those legs my granddaughter is the same those legs never stop
Oh my goodness!!! Those big beautiful eyes are all I could see,I have to rewind it to look at his face!!! I did the same with my baby boy,I'll show his face until he's a lil older,and recognized lol❤❤❤❤❤❤
heads up, that sleep you’re getting is about to change😂 also being on a routine has absolutely nothing to do with how well they sleep. sleep is developmental and isn’t something you can teach or train. they will sleep through the night when they are developmentally ready.🙂
I love these videos SO much ❤
I love this 😭💖💖
ITS BONELESS PIZZA
“Shout out GloZell” 😂😂😂
Are they going to call you guys Dad and Daddy (like Mitch and can from modern family)- or how will the boys differentiate you both when they start talking?
All Ryland wanted was some zucchini boats. Damn ! 😂
I get not wanting to share their faces with the world but i loved seeing that sweet little baby
You blink and they are one and talking and running away from you! Soak in all the baby love while it lasts 😢
flopppp Shane, I wanna see you COOK
Ok.... no offense. But the back of their heads are looking FLAT !!!!!!!!!! Do you understand what that means? That can only happen when a baby lays on their back TOO LONG. There's even an INDENT forming on the backs of their skulls. I'm not even trying to disrespect or offend, I was watching the most recent video and clicked on this, I noted the "flatness" of their heads. PLEASE get them examined. If you're not already. I hope I'm wrong and maybe it's just another issue the babies have I'm not aware of. But their heads shouldn't look FLAT like that.
You guys are such a beautiful family!
Shane and Ry, congrats on being new parents to your two beautiful baby boys. You are doing great, lots of happy things coming your way 😊😊😊😊😊 muah!
You need to try Sanavi sparkling water. The best ever. I pick it over LaCroix every time. So awesome to see your daily dynamic with the babies. 😊
This has been my favorite vlog !! Love seeing my fave dads dadding ❤
Makes me want another set of twins ❤❤
Omgosh... Your babies are soooooo freakin cute guys! shane was right when he was talking about how hard it is to hold back "uploading" pics to social media,
Ryland literally took the "man of the house hat 👨‍🔧 aka the screwdriver 🪛
Shane is so helpful!
shane cooking was my favorite part of my day lol
Wait did you say jettson?????
Why can’t Shane help burp one of the babies while you burp the other?
Wait cow's milk??? They can't have that until they're 12 months old! Am I missing something?
I keep on looking back at the video to see him 😍😍😍 omg god bien them❤❤❤ i love ya😊❤
Chef Shane needs to be a thing. 😅❤
Cute ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
Shane, looking at recipes is still knowing how to cook. it's not cheating. there are some people who don't know how to read recipes— they cannot cook (albeit, if they are looking at a recipe ANYWAY, that should indicate that they are willing to learn to cook).. i learned to cook by reading recipes first to become confident enough in the kitchen, and then i started learning cultural foods from my mom and grandma.  i will say, though, do try going to the grocery store and choosing your own ingredients. i do think post-mating is cheating a little bit... and they probably aren't taking the time out to pick out the best ingredients lol.
Ryland is such a natural!! Shane is very good too and engaging, possibly the comply lifestyle change is a shock on him?! Great daddies ❤😊
goat milk and not formula??? goat milk isn't good for infants under 1 year old did you guys do any research before becoming parents???
The goat milk baby has to be ryans  swimmer 😂
Someone once told me that its okay to break routine every once in a while. It makes your baby adaptable!
Why did Ryland have to feed both babies at once. Like there are two parents here…you each could have fed one??
You two are doing so well with these boys!!  Also shane its not cheating to use other peoples recipes!! You can also make it your own in ways
Cutest babies ever!!!!  So glad you decided to continue  Your journey sharing them with us  Blessing to you and yours :))
You are going to hate this routine stuff when they are older and your busy.
In my opinion the way you choose to show the babies is amazing, you aren't shoving the camera in their faces like a lot of family channels do, you capture the sweet little moments and I love it ♡ I've been watching shane since around when he started and I still can't believe he's a dad! proud of you both ♡
You guys are amazing dads ❤
A little tip, Sit them up when feeding them
Being a dad looks so good on the both of you !!
9 weeks pregnant!!! I’m so happy but I wish life was in my favor rn
11:45 😂😂😂
Twin Mom here of two boys (Luke & Brooks), now 14 years old!  I just want to say that\ you two are doing a great job! I have a few recommendations for you…lower those crib beds as they start sitting up or rolling over.  Before you know it, they’ll be pulling themselves up on the bed and can easily topple over the edge.   Also, I had to get crib nets/cage to prevent them from climbing out and into each others bed, I also recommend the McClaren double stroller.  I began using that around 3/4 months until they were toddlers. Lastly, put a loud fan in their room for white noise.  Blocks out sounds as well.  If one twin wakes up before the other during nap time, you may want to put one baby in a different room during nap time.  I did this and just had a pack n’ play in my guest room.  Eventually, I just ended up separating all together for nap time and the only time that they had slept together was at night. ❤ congrats!
SHAAAAANE MORE COOKING/BAKING ❤ 👨‍🍳
We love your mom era content. We care about the placement of cribs, seeing recipes be made, etc.
what made y’all choose goat and cows milk since they’re at such a young age for those in particular. did their pediatrician say that was OK? genuine question
I haven’t seen Shane this happy/ funny in a long time! I LOL’D for real ❤❤❤
Its needed to say! I Love the Intro music😂always feeling it LOL
Im not saying this backhanded at all, but this is the first time Shane has genuinely made me CACKLE like the OG days. The cinnamon buns part was hilarious
Am I the only one who saw the babies face at one point ?
You guys are the best parents! I do feel like a bad mom bc I was told not to bath my son everyday bc it dries their skin out, plus they don't get dirty really. He's 21 now and he survived so that's a plus! Lol
More cooking with Shane 😁
Shane would be so lost without Ryland
the behind the scenes of what the podcast looks like is crazy
He's showing a crotch shot of his baby while the baby is crying he's showing him giving it a foot massage?? Completely for pedophiles
Ryland you’re such a good dad!!
I LOVE Ryland and Shane as parents! ❤❤
There so cute 🥹🥹🥹
Are you giving them regular milk?
They are freaking precious!!! So glad to see a glimpse of them 🥲
Yesss to more shane cooking vids
not showing their facet on the internet is a good idea
They are the cutest little boys y’all are such good dads even when you feel like you aren’t doing a good job you are don’t ever second guess yourself because I promise you guys are doing a wonderful job for first time dads love you guys💕
soooo cute
The sugar burnt 😂😂
Awww they grow up so fast 🥹
Does anyone know the name of the strollers 🙃
THE CARDOARD ON THE STOVE!!!
The cheeza is basically a parma lol
My husband absolutely loves the turkey pesto sliders I make out of kings Hawaiian rolls. Super fast, super easy. So good.   Shredded turkey or good deli turkey Provolone cheese  Pesto ( we like RAO’s brand best)  Sun dried tomatoes (optional)   Cut your rolls to separate top and bottom, on bottom put a thin layer of mayo, then spread pesto on the top as thick as much as you prefer. On the bottom layer your turkey down and cheese. Drain and dice up your sun-dried tomatoes. Bake at 350 for maybe 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted.   We also make BBQ chicken sliders with cabbage and pineapple slices.
Just fyi from a mom you don't need to bathe the babies everyday ur gonna make there skin really dry or if you do make sure you lotion them afterwards. Love you guys 12:44
Oommgggg i love shane cooking for them!  DO SHANE COOKING VIDEOS ❤❤❤❤ALSO THE BABY'S ARE SO CUTE!
Why do you feed them animal milk at such a young age? Curious
Omggggg they are so adorable 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
I love how they chose to film around the babies. I also love hearing Rylans and Shane make all these weird baby talk noises and sounds. Haha.
Checking in for a new video ! Love you alllllllll
Don’t you eat regularly? You won’t have a full plate of the cinnamon rolls if you ate regularly and enough. It just wouldn’t fit.
I have been watching you guys for so long, and im so so happy you finally have your babies and are starting your fatherhood journeys. I love you guys so much and wish you nothing but the best ❤❤
I haven't started the video but I can already hear Shane saying "who really wants to see this tho"
Where is the crib from?
May babygirl will be 7 months in a week. I feel like I had a baby as the same time as my best friends. You’re amazing dads ❤️
im curious do they have formula? i didnt know babies could have anything else before being a year
@shane vanilla extract!!! in the icing! lol :P
I would LIVE for a Shane and Ryland cooking show 😂❤
My son is about to be 20. I miss every moment of him being a baby!
Ryland was right
With the heart rate Shane it’s mild tachycardia - during pregnancy I had it and it has lingered 2 years after having bubs but it could be iron deficiency, too much caffeine, anxiety, the devils lettuce, alcohol, pots, sleep deprivation can cause it- a whole bunch of things so if it continues def go get it checked out
16:43 same cause I’m pansexual
So Ryland’s the mom and dad lmao why is Ryland having to feed the babies at the same time by himself
Shane made me laugh so much 😂❤
What ad did I just watch.. it was like 5 seconds of a black screen with colorful glitching effects flashing with "You are bugs" in big white letters on the screen. What brand is that 😂
Ryland what stroller is that! It’s so cute!
Shane's chaotic cooking is amazing lol
Goat milk is dairy too 😂😂😂
Ryland & Shane both look so good like both look so happy and healthy , you both look so good with the beards starting!!! Love the vlogs
their gonna be such good dads, omg
Awww I felt so disappointed for you when it was burnt
I kept catching myself trying to tell you through the screen to put vanilla extract in the creamcheese🥲
Ryland is dad goals 🥹 thank you, I love a beautiful example.
I’m sorry Shane, you got a huggsie for the babies! So iconic. Thank you for sharing your new dad lives.
Did you even grease the pan, Shane
I totally respect that you don't show them. But I cried when I saw him. So beautiful ❤
Babies are so cutee❤❤❤❤
“How well do I know her” 🤣❤️
ohmygoodnessss look at that baby! 🥰
“sponsored by me and MY rolls” 💀
This video was fun to watch, ryland being a great multitasking dad, glimpse of baby, and shane cooking❤
The fun meals are overdone shane...move on lol
I cannot imagine having twins if only one parent was available to do these daily routines. So glad you have eachother!
SHANE!!! MAKE MONKEY BREAD NEXT!!!
Wait until you find out Aldi makes Hawaiian roll stuffing lol. Its sooo good but only comes out around Thanksgiving! We stock up!!!
3rd time watching just love it love Shane and your both doing great ❤❤
What is 100° for English people as too us that's boiling them
Shane!!! Adding maple syrup to frosting is a thing my family does too! We also add it to whipped cream instead of powdered sugar and it’s delicious
Not making your BABIES obsessed with ipads 😢
oh I LOVE your routine!! I also did that with my babies and they both are such good sleepers❤
Shane, Don’t give up so fast. Cooking has a learning curve. Make it fun. You can do it!
Shane: I can cook! Also Shane: orders food and semi-bakes instead
Ryland I reccomend waterloo sparkling water its made with real fruits, i also recommend spindrift, i started sipping that instead of soda and its soooo flavorful; if a gay likes it u might like it too! happy couple!
Drop the Frito casserole recipe ❤❤
I don't understand why shane didn't cook the first recipe
They are so sweet, you guys are so sweet, It's all SWEET
Ryland, grow your hair out. This is your sign, now do it!❤
.OMG those infants shouldn't watch an Ipad cause they are so young and small!!! it will literally mess with their brains! go research, I am not hating on you or anything, just want to give you that advice. have a great day everyone 🫶🫶
I would love to watch shane cook for you! It would bring me back to his food videos. Miss them so much! Doesnt have to be anything crazy, the zucchini boats would be cute
Slumber Party is such an underrated Britney song
I got that same denim Winnie the Pooh outfit for my baby girl 😭💖
I make Cinnamon rolls from scratch and the time it takes is worth it! Shane!!!
Shane, you are my uncle's double, red hair and blue eyes, even your smiles match, only you don't drink every day, he's been with his mister for 50 years now! (please don't ever become dependent on alcohol or drugs.) Really enjoy your humor too.
the linh truong music is kind of sending me though
Shane I’m dying laughing with you in the kitchen 😂😂☠️  glad you didn’t take the mix with you to the bathroom lmao
Ok thanks for making my baby fever even worse ahhhh
Love love love you guys! Look forward every week to seeing your new videos! Also love the shane cooking content ❤️ you guys are a beautiful family
Oh my goddddd yall they are sooooooo stinkin cute!!! 🥰
I love to hear babies sucking their baba’s… so cute,,, but I don’t like hearing adults eat haha
Love you Ryland, you make me smile ❤
How does Shane making cinnamon rolls take up half the vlog? 😂 I’m not complaining, I’m LIVING for it. But it is so funny 😅
Cut the burnt part off 😅
The first 3 months are the hardest. After 3 months we had a very smooth routine n sleep through the night too.  They start to show some personality too. I always tell new parents the first 3 months felt like an auto pilot mode I was in. No sleep just go and feed, change clean and repeat lol. After that it just all went smoothly and I got little more sleep as the months came.  So worth it and I’d do it all again.
They are adorable, I want a baby so bad! ❤
Love our little family and our community here!!
editing had me rolling the whole video, love you both 🫶
Also Shane in the kitchen,is everyone😂
Add a little bit of melted butter, almond extract, and a pinch of salt & it’s golden cinnamon roll frosting
They are so cute love you guys 🫶🏽
I just love that Ryland jokes about being the mom yet he’s the one doing the physical stuff putting together the cribs talking them apart😂😂😂  ahh gender roles crazy stuff 😂 he’s literally a mam and a dad in one!!
Anyone know how I’m able to play rylands YouTube videos in the background while in other apps but I can’t with any other YouTube videos? (I do not have premium)
I’m exactly like Ryland and I’m very schedule oriented when it comes to my baby!
I have such a crush on Spencer omg
Likeit
Hi
Hey
Hey hilikeit
Is it normal for Americans to survive to adulthood without even rudimentary cooking skills?
Not Ryland always remembering it far worst then what it was. MAMA you need some rest, missy. Good luck with your big boys.
OMGOODNESS  I  LAUGHED SO HARD SHANE I LOVE U ❤️ THIS WAS GREAT VIDEO
I need more of Shane’s cooking videos 😂 It was iconic
I love this so much they are such cute parents I have watch Shane and ryland for so long and seeing the became parents it just melts my heart ❤❤❤
watching this while holding my 6 week old son 🥰
Structure is so great for babes. I have a 16 month old. Gets easier after a year because they can eat snacks. But it’s hard missing a nap. Soak up the cuddles.
Is it goat milk formula?  Or actual goat milk.  Just curious.  Also, do you have swings for them?  Both of my boys loved being in the swing.
Shane is giving weaponized incompetence… just make some damn dinner 🤣🤣
Ok but I need Shane to make Ryland that zucchini boat. He needs to redeem himself
Shane! I worked as a manager for 15 years at a KFC. Let me know if you have questions lol!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
this was so sweetttt the way he loved the bites 😭
Is his real name Jetson?
ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I love this little family so much already ❤
SHANE, Look up monkey bread, you'll love them, thank me later 🙂
A little tip Shane for cinnamon rolls specifically, always cook them for less time than you're supposed to. You can always put them back in if they aren't cooked enough. Like for me I use Annie's cinnamon rolls and I always pull them out 4-5 minutes early. Kinda depends on your oven too.
Love these guys, but Shane seriously needs a makeover. He looks homeless. Rylan is so Dad, wears cute clothes. Shane isn't a bad looking guy but his clothing is atrocious.
Cute as trick
Interesting the last two videos I saw were ones about not showing the babies and the first video I see in months has the babies 🙄🙄🙄
So your trying chicken parmigiana
Ryland is such a good dad 🥰
<3
Thanks for talking about Motaz Azaiza and Bisan Owda 🤍
As a long time watcher of both you and Shane, I wanted to say I’m so proud of you both!!! You’ve been through so much and I’m glad to see you guys thriving as dads!!❤️🥹🥹
Ryland looks like Jared leto
when I saw the baths and Jets little face OMG! freaking adorable!
Definitely trying the cinnamon rolls! The boys are so precious 😍, also cooking is very therapeutic lol
Ooh my heart!💜 I love hearing the baby talk!!!
Cinnamon rolls are always like 10 minutes or else they burn!!
Shane stays flopping recently.. first with that ridiculous bread stick theory and so much for cooking a nice Family dinner... uh yeah okay Lol
I love them as dads
Ryan you are such a good daddy/ mommy. Shane is literally the dad doing his shenanigans while you do the hard work 😂 but don’t get me wrong you guys are genuinely good parents. 💙 thanks for the cute little baby moments. 🎉
Goats milk is still dairy….
You’re both amazing dads and I’m so happy to see y’all thriving💖 Side note, it can be extremely dangerous to give your baby cow milk before a year. Hope that helps and people don’t think I’m being a Karen parent or something. Much love 💖
Did you play your vids to mums tum during incubation period? Do you face time mum? X m
The chizza looks like stoner food🤢 you just paid for an over price piece of shit in a box🤮
this makes me so happy ❤
Shane had me cracking up, “sponsored by MY rolls tho…” I’m dead.
Beautiful boys!😭🫶🫶
Isnt goats milk bad for babies under 1?
I love how Ryland keeps us in the loop with the goal of the video… the cribs being against the wall I was actually wondering how they would be placed and he said it and I was like wow he actually remembers 😂🥰🫶🏼
I’m struggling so bad with having to feed my baby in the night. He’s 7 months old and I still have to get up once or twice. Not sure what I’m doing wrong but hope it works for you guys haha
Love how you manage with the babys.
you shouldn't be feeding a baby under 12 months old any type of dairy, they should be on formula  https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/foods-and-drinks/cows-milk-and-milk-alternatives.html#:~:text=At%2012%20months%20old%20(but,of%20nutrients%20your%20baby%20needs.
I wanna I own what stroller you have 😭
You guys are killing it and your babies are so cute omg  Be careful with those bath temp testers though  They are cute and seem safe but the batteries leak and can get the battery acid in the bath water. It happened to me with the otter one and someone else I know it happened to. So just make sure your checking it being sure ❤️
Roland's become very handsome genital man.  Shane try maple syrup in a meatloaf or  burger recipe.  Tip from 🇨🇦 ❤
Idk if its true or not, and im sure its not true but by looking at ur vlogs its seems like you do everything and shane doesnt but i dont see your whole life so im not sure
Just a heads up, not safe to swaddle them anymore. Look into sleep sacks, they will love them! :)
Shane deciding to cook and then doing dessert instead is what is actually going to happen when the boys are big enough to eat with them.😂😂
I am so Shane🤣🫶ok I have to try this recipe and hope I don’t burn them🥹
Can I just say Ryland is such a good dad. He is so organized and scheduled. I love it.
Y’all are doing so great. Ryland you especially giving excellent mama vibes.
Showing and not showing them the way y’all are is so graceful guys. Nice job. Congrats!
It's a chicken parm with pepperoni on top
ohhh myyy they’re are soo adorable 😭👶🤍!! You Two have the cutest baby ever !!!🥹
8:27, 8:28 and 8:29 saw of one of the babys so grown up already 😢
Did it annoy anybody else just as much that he didn't tell Ryland what the bread was made of ?! 🤣😭🤣🤣🤦🏼‍♀️
It’s so cute how they already interact with their daddies and each other
Im curious why they are on goat and cow milk so early?
He is so cute laying in his little bath, and they have gotten so big.. so sweet they are adorable. ❤
Omg this is so sweet your little family is now complete!! Congratulations too both of you ...❤
he did not pronounce “akon” as “accon” 😂😂😂😂
You make such a great father! You both do. But Ryland’s giving Max the bath melted my heart love and support you both so much. Your family is beautiful. Your future is blessed.
im from hawaii!! i felt connected when shane started talking about hawaiian rolls bc yes they are that girl
i love watching you guys so much you two are incredible!! you guys are amazing dads!!
Goat milk? Not formula? I’m confused😅
Me sat in work (kfc) watching this 😂😂😂
Just me or did Shane call lying to himself…”so much faith in himself”
I love how much Shane loves Ryland
It's funny how Shane never helps with or really does anything!
"They're already asleep"😂😂😂
I've never related to and loved you more than when u said you dident want to go outside for a walk ahahhahah❤❤😂😂 I hate walking!
😌😌😍😍
Don't worry about showing their faces. They change so much so quickly that it doesn't even matter. I have to tell you both that I had my reservations about raising twins but I've been pleasantly surprised. Your hearts are in the right place and your doing a great job. Not that you need my seal of approval but you've got it. :)
Love the Dobie t shirt❤
stop they’re so cute and so aware, i have a 7 month old daughter, it’s so insane how much they change literally everyday and how much they grow and change right in front of our faces!! 🥺
THAT BABY IS SO CUUUTEEE
This video is genuinely.. almost inspiring me to be a better mom? Like it really makes me want to tighten up on my little love's schedule a bit. I enjoyed this vlog so much! 🥰🧡
I think it would be safe to show on rylands vlogs, but never Shane's channel. Too many views over there!
I do mukbangs on my channel !! I'm new if you wanna check it out ❤
It's Shane food videos all over again and I love it!
Oh my gosh!! They are PRECIOUS!!!! 🥰
I pissed myself when Shane tasted the roll 😹💀
I LOVE THIS VIDEO ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I ❤how Shane found himself a Chef 👨‍🍳 he’s actually Amazing 🔥👑👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Shane treats the babies like there cats or dogs not humans 😳
I still do the hotdogs chopped up in Mac and cheese 😂
You guys are the best!! ❤️ Can you explain the milk for them a little more because I thought new babies can’t have cows/goat milk. Just curious ❤
Oh I could say so much
Shave damn.
Both shave about that
No just the partner as the other parent
Vanilla extract pure. I watched the same video
Love love this content!!! Thank you for showing us a clip of that sweet boy! So precious ♥️♥️
Adding a suggestion Incase you Dad’s may be interested.  I started dipping a tip of a teaspoon in formula then dipping the wet spoon tip in rice cereal. Then I mixed the spoon into bottle of formula.  I did this only with last feeding before night sleep. I also opened the night nipples with a  sterilized   Needle.  My baby slept from 8:00pm to 6:60 am.
As they get older you can definitely tell whos sperm was whos lol ... So adorable!
Not glozel😂
I'm ao happy for you guys. I love watching you guys be parents & Ryland really take one the mommy role. Cherish the time when they're babies because it really does fly! Love you all, praying you guys always stay happy & health ❤❤
I am Shane..  and Shane is me and he is we and we are all together.  That's some Beatles shit right there.   -Sleep deprived full time working mother.
There are baby food makers. They steam and blend the food ❤ i think a good first food that babies seem to love is sweet potato. It purees very nicely. Fruits puree nicely too, but they're a bit watery, so you can add banana to thicken it into a creamy mixture. Meats are a bit more difficult.
I’m getting the vibe that Ryland is present and Shane is there in case needed which he hopes doesn’t happen. There are telltale signs in other videos. I know I’m going to get backlash but I’ve followed them since the beginning and know how Shane works. He is an introvert, but also very social. I was really hoping that becoming a father would change him for the better. At least Ryland has a good family support system.
Where did y’all get the cribs? Can I get a link pls
Shut the front door HE’S SO CUUUUTEE his little face. Omg 😭 also their kicking legs 🤗
Seeing Shane get excited about the clothes and when he was holding the little babes and making noises to him was SO cute omg. Both in your dad era. Doing a wonderful job guys!
Omggg in dying Shane was so proud and happy to make the cinnamon rolls and they burned 😭🤣 but honestly Shane you should pick up the hobby of cooking ! It brings a sense of joy! And a great hobby!!!
I didn't know young babies could have goat milk..... Or anything other than breast milk or formula. I do know babies cannot tolerate cow milk until at least a year old
Omggg my heart melted during the babies face during bath time 🥺🥺 the cutest boys! Omg I am so happy and proud of you guys! You guys have fatherhood down pact!!
That crib 😍 you should review baby equipment! Just an idea 💜
They are the cutest babies 😍 thank you for showing them ❤️
Omg I was so happy to see a little glimpse of baby Jets cute little face  !  😢
Loved watching Shane cook and shenanigans ❤❤❤😊
30:38 🤣🤣🤣🤣 thanks for making me laugh when I needed it
That sugar rush tho lol 😅😂❤
I would love a series of you guys learning to cook for the boys!
Shanes hair looks sickening in the beginning!
I love seeing you both as dad’s. It’s the sweetest thing! Please postman more videos like this.
HELLO BEAUTIFUL FAMILY THANK U 4 SHARING ❤️❤️❤️ it ALL UR BABIES R ao 🥰 CUTE 🥰 GOOD I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOUR NEXT VIDEO!!! ❤️
Ok, Shane & Ryland new scrapbooks started yesterday!  🩵
Kinda disappointed at the promise to cook then makes buns with butter and sugar look difficult...lol anyone? lol - those boats looks so good!
I love how supportive ryland is... Im so upsted he didnt get his zucchini boat...
Ryland is the best mom ❤
Me enjoying a Shane cooking show was not in my bingo card honestly! I need more Shane cooking please 😅 Also I love seeing you both as dads honestly!
Seeing you guys me dads just makes me heart happy
dont u think the problem is the tempt of the oven? cause being burnt two times is just 😂
My baby just turned 1 and we have done a bath before bed routine every night since he was about a month old. No soap every night but just playing. I think it’s partly the routine as to why he’s such a good sleeper now. So I think you doing that is great!   Also have you hear of baby-led-weaning for introducing solids. We did that at 6 months, with no introduction of purées in between, and he is SUCH a good eater (though I know every baby is different) if you guys haven’t heard of it (which you probably have) I highly recommend looking into it. 😊 good luck on that endeavour!
You’re feeding them goats milk?! Aren’t they only 3 almost 4 months. That’s way too early?!
Awe Ryland you’re so sweet with the babies ❤😍 soo cute made me smile!
I love how you guys are showing your babies and their routines ❤ jet looks so much like Jerid and Mama Yaw its crazy 😮 and max looks so much like ryland and vicki ❤ such precious little boys with amazing dads ❤❤
Loved Shane in this
THIS IS THE BEST VLOG EVER😭🥹🫶🏼 So real and fun! I love the baby stuff bc babies and it’s fun seeing you guys be dads! 🥹💕
why is no one talking about how good Shane looks.???????
Mentally crumbling 😂 MEEEE
My twin boys are four, it gets easier. I remember being tied down to their schedule, it is really difficult. Here soon they should naturally progress into sleeping through the night. Also, my twins started army crawling at 4 months and one of them was walking by 9 months. I recommend you start baby proofing now lol 😂 Y'all are doing great ❤
Soooo I love the content like just a little more now that you guys are dads ❤️❤️ and for Ryland, I can totally relate because my baby girl just turned 3 months this past Sunday 💖🍼 and for Shane, you’re looking gooooood, girl! I see you eating healthy, going for walks with Ry. Just love you guys 😂😅😊
Aw make ryland the zucchini boats. It does not matter to us if it’s something exciting or fun just make it realistic.  Love seeing the mother Ryland has turned into 🥹❤️
We love you Dawson Yaw adams family (ily)
Wow❤ thank ❤you so much! I didn’t expect that. How precious and adorable 🥰
We need more cooking vids from shane
I think getting into cooking is a great idea Shane. I wish you guys a lot of fun
They are so stinkin cute!!!! that lil face ohmygoodness!!!! <3 thanks for the glimpse of them! They arent the the main focus though, so its a very tasteful way that you show them!!
Yes mobiles above the crib are good, babies need stimulus
Any type of lavender scented lotion/oil helps TREMENDOUSLY with sleeping, I used to bath them w the lavender soap & rub down w the lotion after, makes them sleepy & relaxed......  your such amazing daddy's ❤
You know what would make your videos amazing………..stop with all the “F” bombs
One baby product I’d 1000% recommend is the Baby Einstein Aquarium! My daughter is absolutely mesmerized by it and I’m sure you’d get some squeals of joy from your boys. We take it with us everywhere we go!
OMGosh, seeing Jet's face up close is the cutest thing ever! :) They truly are beautiful boys & they are blessed to have you both as their parents! Together you work really well together! <3 <3 <3  I agree that the way your filming them in your stories and not plastering their faces first. Many blessings to both of you and your entire families!!  Love You Guys! <3 <3  <3
https://youtu.be/CDd7Sz3H48g?si=MiXHKcaKPEwIt8c-
They are beautiful congratulations 😊
Baby: ✨burps✨ Ryland: OH! Did you hear it!?  😂 I’m a mom so I understand the excitement. y’all are so cute as parents!
Baby Led Weaning great!!!
i could eat biscuits and gravy all day RYLAND 😭
I love how well Ryland knows Shane. He straight up picked up the pan and was like "Were these suppose to be normal size and you messed up?" 😂😂
OMG…. They are getting so big!  They are precious
Can you share what link to the mobile?!?!? ♥️♥️♥️
14:50 that would be fun to watch you make it. It doesn’t have to be something crazy I love watching people cook, especially if it’s something I want to eat and those zucchini boats sound delicious
14:35 it’s not cheating by using recipes you’re still cooking it. The more and more you cook you’ll get inspiration from these recipes and make it your own.
Lol when Shane says to Ryland “made from scratch” 🤣
Routines are life with twins. We lived our lives based on their routines when they were babies. We still stick pretty close to the same bedtime & they are 4. They can stay up a little late but not more than maybe an hour or they get cranky & unpleasant.
i need more shane cooking and baking!!! it'll be so healthy for you and the boys. cannot be ordering food when they're a lil older, unhealthy and a terrible example to set for them. love this journey for you both i can't stop watching!!!!
I love seeing Shane involved in the vlogs. Sometimes it sounds like you do everything  for the babies (and housework) and he isn’t involved so it’s lovely to see. You both love them so much and it’s such a wonderful thing to watch🥹
Ohh i just loved this vlog so much. Thanks for letting us have a peak in your day with the babies <3
You both are such good parents ❤
Cinnamon roll recipe that's lazy and easy and delicious..... get the pre-made Cinnamon rolls anybrand and then lay them out in a casserole dish(the one with the sides) add an entire quart (per roll tube) of heavy whipping cream. Cook 13 minutes and then carefully flip them and cook for another 8 minutes at 425.  Then add the icing at the end on top of it all.   It's so good.
My youngest is now 3 and fuck i miss those feeding sounds 🥲🥰
I loveeeeed this video 🥹 pls do more like this!
Shane is great❤
Ryland forgets we saw him try to cook! 🤣
I will have  Always been an Will continue to be a shane and Ryland fan. Shane’s humor is great. Hawaiian rolls are bomb, I finally had them like a few yrs ago and they a favorite. lol the chopped hot dogs in max n cheese.I think we all grew up eating that.  I relate to Shane so much. Me and my rolls😂😂 were definitely the mid 80a babies.
A dump, a dallop, and a bloop! I need these on measuring cups and measuring spoons stat Shane!
dude I LOVE seeing Shane like this!! haha idk what it is! I love them
6:38 min in... PLEASE TELL ME WHERE YOU FIND THAT POOH OUTFIT AT, !!!
I get not wanting to show faces but man are they adorable. 😢
So cute!
Am I crazy or jet looks like Shane 🥹🥹
Everything yall are doing….keep doing it. ❤️❤️❤️ I felt special and fulfilled getting to see a glimpse while also still getting the DADDIES.
Only dads can talk about going to Tswifts concert when you have 3 month olds in the house. I remember feeling so guilty if I did anything for myself in the first few years of my baby’s life.
“This is not sponsored by Hawaii or their rolls it’s sponsored by me and my rolls” LMFAOO 17:26
The internet is such a scary place. I knew before I had my son I would rarely post him. I’m veryyyyyy funny about him, he is almost 2 and I have been away from him 3 times total and that is to have an icecream date with my husband. I only “trust” my parents with him, and even then I’m still on edge, knowing he is completely safe! I only post him on holidays, like family pictures. ☺️
When my daughter was 3 months old I started putting a little cereal in her bottle at her last feeding before she went down for the night and she slept through the night because it kept her full longer. Just a suggestion 😁
I just want to encourage you that I think most of us will still watch if you do not show the twins faces. I love that you are giving them privacy & not exploiting them like most family channels. If you need to blur their faces, I will still be here. Also love seeing the realistic life as new parents (been there)!!!!
Spencer is super cute and handsome :P I don't think I would be his type, but he seems like a great guy.
Can you educate me on like the goat milk thingy??? I was so shocked cuz I always thought babies needed breast milk or formula until closer to 12 months but I’m also no a mother and not knowledged on this whatsoever so I’m just genuinely asking
Shane’s bit when he was cooking for you… I was in tears 😂😂😂. Ohhh I love you guys
Ryland I love how organized you are. I was never that good. Seeing the babies melts my heart. They are so cute.  I loved seeing Shane in the kitchen. It’s been a long time.  You two are the best dads.
Ryland did your pediatrician recommend goat's milk. I have heard it is not a good or safe alternative to regular cows milk for infants.
More Shane cooking pleaseeeee
Listen I’ve been watching you guys since the beginning. I met you Ryland on Shane’s channel. You have both brought me through some dark times. It’s so cool to see you guys parents!! I couldn’t be happier! You all deserve the best!  Love you guys!! P.S. you guys are still real and you can tell that you aren’t jaded…its refreshing
I love that you choose not to film their faces for obvious reasons. But I do admit the little peak we got made my heart melt. You guys are blessed <3
Shane positively DRAGGING Ryland for burning the Christmas morning cinnamon rolls and proceeds to burn them is perfect. Only topped by Ryland immediately figuring out that you messed up… and improvised… he read you like a book 😂❤
Please make a Korean cheese dog!!
I know everyone gives you a hard time. But as someone who has extreme anxiety about if ill be able to be a good parent or not, watching and learning from you is truly awesome.
You guys are such AWESOME DADIES!! 🎉❤
I have loved you guys forever but I am absolutely living for you two as dads!! You guys are the cutest!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Shane - you need to bring out adult onesies merch!
Gosh seeing them gives me huuuuge baby fever🥺🥺
Love you 4 so freaking much. I laugh so much it always makes my day better ❤❤❤❤❤
What a sweet adorable baby!!!!!
I feel like "mentally crumbling" needs to be a new merch design. 😂 PS I want a cinnamon roll!
Last week was my first time making cookies and I burnt the bottom by accident I don’t know why it happened 😂but they were still good
Loooove this dad era, been here since the beginning of Shane’s YouTube career and I’m liiiiving for this. Also, please look up the English comedian Keith Lemon Bear character and tell me he doesn’t look like Jarid  in that bear outfit - dyiiiing! 😂😂😂😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I know you don’t like showing their faces but I die when you do! omg they are the CUTEST Babies EVER 😍
Shane, just buy the Pillsbury cinnamon rolls. I love your risk taking though.
I wonder if they know which one belongs to who 🤔
Yall should reaalllyyy start back cooking my husband favvv mealss sooo funnn, love you guys !!!
Ryland & Shane — love you guys and have been watching you since 2007.   I do have a bit of a concern as a parent: I’ve always been told (even by my daughter’s pediatrician) that babies shouldn’t have cows milk/dairy until they’re a year old. For goats milk, it’s about 9 months.   Just a cautionary note from a fellow parent. ✌🏼
Jet is Shane’s absolute double omg!! So cute ☹️☹️☹️
U can tell it was burnt
When my son suffered with cmpa I was told to avoid goats milk as it has the same proteins as cows milk.. i was told to give him soya milk
Ps. Thank you for the little sneak peeks of their unbelievably perfect little faces and I think you guys are doing just fine and honoring their privacy with fierce love and protection and the occasional glimpse is soooo adored by all of us and we thank you for letting us be a tiny piece of your amazing journey as new fathers!!! ❤❤❤ 23:13 I love Daddies Shane and Ryland Era it’s awesome and I adore you all. Thanks for the cook segment hilarious and loved every second 😂😂😂😂
This chapter of your relationship is my favorite!  Love to see you being parents! ❤ Enjoy every minute of it, they grow up so fast!
Amazing Daddy’s!!!!! ❤🎉🎉🎉 you guys are doing an incredible job and I must say it definitely looks like you can clearly see who’s got who’s Daddy genetics and it’s adorable they’re literally mini you guys and sooo insanely cute!!! Ok super model baby makers #work lol ❤❤❤❤ love you 4 so much 😊😊
Taylor is so basic nothing special
Okay but I’m obsessed with Shane’s cooking portion of the video 🤣 I’d binge the heck out of Shane cooking videos 🤣♥️
It's burnt 🤢🥺🤮🥺🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That Gordon Ramsay joke was VERY good 😂
Not Shane making McDonald's old Cinnamelts
Omg the boys are just so cute!!!! Those little chunky legs😍 also, tell Shane he cannot sleep on the Disney clothes at Walmart. I got THE CUTEST Winnie the Pooh outfit for my new baby
I would put the one that was done first over my leg instead of my shoulder to burp. Because I always sat on the floor to feed. That away none one had to wait for the other. Plus, if they spit up when they burp its not running down you then.
the glozell edit🤣
Yessss... It's monkey bites where I come from... So yummy and omg to die for
Shane cooking/baking is my new favorite thing!
So im only 3 minutes into this: Ryland my high maintenance mama, that KFC pizza is simply chicken parm with pepperonis ☠️ gagging is crazy 🤣
the way you guys tag team is the way you will survive. PROPS!!
I’m living for this daddy day in the life! and getting a sneak peek of the boys! They are getting so big!🥹
I’ve got a question! Do you give the babies goat/dairy milk? I’m just curious because I know that babies are usually formula fed or breastfed for the first year of life. Every baby is different though!
This video almost makes me want to have another baby lol they are adorable!
Omg… amazing video.  Just what I needed to watch after work.  Loved the cooking.  So funny.  😂.  You guys are rocking parenting together.
I'm howling at Jarrod taking that huge bite and Shane's response. 4:13
I wish I could be friends with yall so much!!!
Yall are literally my favorite YouTuber couple ever!!!
I can not imagine putting my babies to bed at 7.. never. Everyone’s is different tho. I kept mine up with me so we could all sleep in the morning. And guess what they adjusted just fine to life. I would never wake a sleeping baby to feed it either.
So Rylan is always holding jet and Shane is always holding max …so cuteee a lot of tummy time so they don’t get flat heads
I very genuinely agree, I don’t want to see their faces. They aren’t consenting to being filmed yet. I love how you guys have been doing it, where they obviously are the center of your worlds but not the center of your vlogs. I love the updates, I love hearing about your dad lives but I appreciate them not being used for attention tbh
Jet is a little Ryland I know you guys don't care which one is who's biological child but omg he is your twin ❤❤❤
It’s your pan!! Don’t use a dark pan!!
I get not showing their faces but omg they're cute. Even a faceless (how we do it) 7AM-Night routine would be 🔥 cause I could never.
19:16. The CUUUUUUUUTEST BABY EVER !!!!!!!!!!!! Hearts melting all over the world
hair looks gorgeous ry 🫶😩‼️
Shane and Ryland should watch the Traitors! They’d love it!
Just watched a podcast YESTERDAY where Shane + Ryland stated they were not going to show the babies (besides their newborn pics) 🤷‍♀️ This is titled day with twin babies...ya, the babies are kind of a background sitch but in 1 day they went from no baby pics to a whole vid...babies are beautiful. I wish you all the best. Keep the twins private tho!
❤😊 so cute!
I love u i know u just had young babies but I hope shane treats you right love u
I wish their faces weren’t showing if I’m being totally honest. I love seeing them but the danger is so insane
Just watched a podcast YESTERDAY with Shane + Ryland saying they're NOT going to show the babies....ya the babies are like a background sitch but the title is "Day with twin babies". If this isn't showing the babies 🤷‍♀️ They're beautiful. I wish you all the best. Keep the babies private tho!
I’m so in Love with the growth from Shayne. Since getting the babies he’s grown so much it seen n you guys are just doing so great! The babies look happy & so healthy. Ur killin it Ryland. A1 papa.❤
@loraeanastasia  When Shane put those rolls in for 20 minutes I ALREADY KNEWWWW... LOL!. That save THOUGH cutting the bottoms off... A++ Shane 😻
I love this. Squeeeeeee …. As I hold my own 4mo old.
Be proud Shane!  Ryland, love watching you with both boys.  You are great Dad's!
I LOOOOOOVED Rylands videos cooking for everyone! Shane, ANYTHING you make would have been great and fun to watch. Also justice for Rylands Zucchini boats!!!! He needed them! 🤣
Loved this vlog, and the crumble cookie idea was so funny ❤
I’m from Quebec, we put maple sirup in evrything that needs sugar hehe
I love you guys you make my day 😊
That's burnt lol
Can you make a video about naps and bedtime routine? Do you swaddle them during the day? Are they in the dark during the day for naps? Are you stern about nap times or do you follow their cues day to day? Do you put them down awake, drowsy or fully asleep for naps and nighttime? I have an almost 3 month old so I’m curious what you guys do!
All I can say is love you guys ❤
I am only 7 mins in and already so happy .Seeing Shane hold one of the babies just warms my heart .You both are amazing parents.And I love that we get to watch you on this journey.I just love you both so much and couldn't be happier for you guys.
Bruh they’re so cute
Petition for Shane to make Ryland the zucchini boat dish
Seat Geek jacks their prices up too high. I buy from the box office itself. It's always cheaper.
They’re so cute 🥹 I have a 2 year old boy and watching yall raise your boys is just so sentimental to me I love it
Very quickly I love how the bois are growing so beautifully, they look healthy and happy and they are so softly loved. My little heart is overjoyed looking at them ❤️🥺🧿
I love how softly, sweet Sandy is with Chris. I love them both so much and Jerid is slaying that bear outfit!!!!
They are too cute! I wish we could see the boys more, I love the dad content It makes me so happy seeing you both so happy.❤️
He is Shane’s double!! 🥰
Shane you just needed to add a little salt to the icing 😂
Ryland you look so so happy ❤
"This is how we feed" 😂😂
The food argument on the walk made me die laughing hahaha crying jajajaj
I don’t consider using a recipe cheating. Is it?
Go to the kings Hawaiian restaurant in Torrance. It’s amazing and the rolls are freshly baked
Ryland was born to be a daddy 😢❤
I can't believe you guys can leave your babies in a room by themselves with the door closed.. please teach me your secrets 😅 sincerely a stressed out momma. Who also had her baby listening to your podcasts!
"Made from scratch" is apparently just buying some bread and putting some topping on it😂
Omgggg I love seeing you guys be dads! The baby talk is adorable! It pretty much comes naturally when you have a kid! 😂
I got the baby bullet to make the kid I nanny for food. And I just steamed the fresh veggies(keeps more nutrients that way) from the local farm and then blended them. Start with greens. And it takes more than one time for a child to realize they don't like something. Just bc they kinda gag a bit the first time, they might like it the 2nd. I love watching you two father. It's so cute!! Your babies are lucky to have such loving dads!!! ♥️♥️
Who is going to tell them that GOAT milk is literally dairy ?? Hello ?
Knowing Shane and Ryland, they are just going to door dash and postmates all their meals forever lol I can’t see either of them actually cooking something that isn’t for a video. 😂😂😂😂😂 like they are going to end up hiring a chef to work for them because they can’t cook at allllll 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I KNEW 20 minutes on the bottom rack was gonna burn those rolls😂
The way you talk to the babies is everything. It kinda makes me tear up. I loooooove it!!!!!
So happy for y'all 😭❤️
I'm going through a 6 1/2 year relationship break up. As soon as I put this video on and heard your voice Rylan and heard Shane's laugh all of my stress and tears went away xx thank you so much for making me happy when I couldn't make myself happy xx I love you guys so much xx❤❤❤❤
im so proud of you two, y’all are doing an amazing job raising these little boys. love you so much
Omg seing Shane just thriving making his man cinnamon bites that just made my day 😂😍😍
Omg seeing their faces I could cry 😭😭😭😭
Thank you for sharing their beautiful smile. We really feel like we are on this journey with you two. 🩷
Can you do a video of your favorite baby items so far!
Omgggg! I literally teared up when you showed his perfect little face! 🥹  The boys are absolutely ADORABLE and you guys are the BEST dads! 🫶🏼
Goat milk is still dairy 😂   You guys are such great daddies❤❤❤❤ I'm so happy to get the little glimpses of your beautiful lil boys!!!thank you so much for sharing the journey with us!!!
When you showed his sweet little face during his bath I literally teared up... which is probably a little weird but he is just SO precious 😍 😭
Using the baby as content.
23:43 not the glozelle cinnamon challenge vid 😭😭
I love how Shane’s version of measurements are 💩 related 😂
Maybe paper liners in the cupcake tin next time?
i love you guys as parents🥹🥹 yall lookin to adopt a 20 yro??😂❤️
6:56 So he speaks bird! 😆
I laughed at Shane this entire video he needs to do comedy I swear. He's hilarious n the effort so cute. I'm not a great cook by any means but I'm telling u there's great baby food recipes out there while also learning how to cook as well. It's easy to do simple recipes then up ur game slowly. Cinnamon rolls gd start! Also loved seeing the babies n that its not for views just cute quick look they're gorgeous
😊ឲ
Jet's cuteness made me SCREAM! This side of Ryland and Shane is adorable 🥰
Cooking is making what you have at home.. I’m with Shane 12:31
Content for idiots
Shane! Next time try using glass not tin pan! 🥰 the tin pan makes it way too easy to burn yummy pastries like your rolls! Lol
OH MY GOD THE BABIES ARE SO CUTESY MERRRRR ❤❤❤❤
20 mins!!! The buns are already cooked lol.... I was happy you finally melted the butter in the microwave tho lol 🎉❤
Omg your babies are so stinking adorable!!!! ❤❤❤❤
Omg they are so freaking cute ❤
Here for the parent vlogs🎉
Whose the mother?
I am with everyone where we say we totally understand not showing them but MY HEARTTTTTT🥹😭😭😭 they’re so precious!!! Congratulations again to y’all 🥳💫🫧✨
Shane cooking videos are what the internet is missing.
Loved Shane cooking, he slayed and was super funny while doing it. 🎉
wtf is that a tablet/screen?! 7:08
One valuable advice:  during feeding, you should hold the babies (get Shane to feed one!)  because feeding time is usually bonding time with mother and baby. It's healthy for their psyche.
shane looks really good !
I’m mad Shane didn’t make stuffed bell pepper sounded so good
I would have had the mother with you for the first few months or so, because breast milk is the healthiest and best start for babies.
Make food and blend it for when they move on to solids or when they're teething. My mum used to make 4 sets of meals blend and freeze them
OMG, you guys your sons are adorable and oh so handsome! I really appreciate and respect how you’ve chosen to incorporate them without pushing them into the spotlight, it feels super organic while still maintaining their privacy. I love seeing you two as parents ❤
Muma Ryland is honestly so impressive. Your doing amazing sweetie 👏🏻 he’s so ON it with them babies. It’s adorable and a side I’ve never seen from  Ryland.
Baby's can only take baths like 2 or 3 times a week, otherwise their skin will get too dry
Shane we want more cooking videos 🙌🏼we here for it
When i saw the babys face i was like omg he forgot to edit this part n i almost wanted to exit the video to give u ur privacy 😂 they are adorable i wish we were neighbors my baby is turning 3 on march 20th😢 btw u guys are amazinggg dads❤❤❤❤
Shane's cooking reminds me so much of my husband - just experimenting with ingredients until you come up with the perfect flavour combination. I hope to see more in future!
omg that baby face was so precious 😭🥹 and just have to say shane you look so good !!
Shane needs to start a cooking channel called  " Here's the thing !" Pllleeeaassee ❤️🔥
Ok chef shane
literally is so so bittersweet and wholesome to see you and shane as dads now, ive been watching both of you sense early 2018 and ive followed the journey to you guys being dads and GODDDDD im so happy for you and shane
No shade but pleaseeeeeee how dramatically can the easiest recipe EVER be dragged out 😂😂
omgg his sweet little innocent eyes 😭😭😭😭
“this is sponsored by me and my rolls” omg i died of laughter 😂 💀
I am totally down for Chef Shane! Can’t wait for the cookbook, food vlogs, food pod cast, food merch! Let’s do dis!
Who edited this video? 😂
Wait Why is one on goat milk and the other in cow milk?
Omg they are so beautiful ❤ it's awesome to see yall go through this journey. My youngest is 13 months and my oldest is 15. Yall are going to have some really tough times but its soo rewarding. Wait till yall start getting Christmas and other holiday gifts they make at school to give yall❤ the Christmas one especially lol.  Sorry for my rant I've watched yall for years and I'm so excited for yall😊
OMGGGG, JET'S LITTLE CUTE 😍 FACE ❤❤🎉AWWW
Please start cooking more 🎉
you guys legit make me so happy🫶🏻
Even newborns can have routines!! They sense it too like for example with the time change it’ll throw there whole day off!
You will always be in awe of how they change and grow up my babygirl is 4 and every time I look at her I feel like she’s grown up. And I see her 24/7 lol 😂 being a parent is freaking awesome!
me watching u bake while im baking cookies
Try a different material to cook the cinnamon rolls in, the metal conducts too much heat. Just a thought.
So happy to see how your family has grown !! Love the babies parts of the videos !! Love seeing them healthy and happy babies . May God bless them both .
I laughed so hard when Shane found out it was burnt 💀😂
Ryland you are doing such a great job! My heart completely melted when you showed your baby 🥹 I understand not wanting to show them but I hope we can see more content of you guys interacting with them like you showed us in this video 🫶🏼
Sometimes i feel like shane being back on the internet is a fever dream and im living for the lives you two have built. Its like watching a best friend flourish. ❤
THEY ARE BOTH SO CUTE I CANNOT TAKE IT!!!
I heard you mention he can't handle dairy...maybe I'm confused but from my research infants can't have dairy (Cow milk) until 12 months or they risk intestinal bleeds
*Cook the Hawaiian Roll Cinnamon Rolls  for 10 minutes, not 20, it’s how I make mine.*
Max is just like my 2 month old Rinoa.  Rinoa's tummy can't handle cows milk formula so she drinks goats milk formula and I see a big difference on how she is.
Sooo cute 🥰
O. M. G. Ryland! His little face is soooo freaking precious! 🥺 But gate keep them from this community! 💯 (But show us once a month there face changes 🥹) And SHANE cooking and making those cinnamon rolls! I would watch him cook everyday just to hear his humor and funny self! I was laughing the whole time he was making those 😂
Loving and agreeing with all of thw comments! Youre both doing amazing sweeites ✔️💓
Seeing the twins even for a sec is precious! Ryland & Shane, you're mastering this parenting gig. Loving the mix of content you give us! 😊💖
Omg sooooo adorable ❤
Just saying in case no one ever tells you. You really shouldn’t bath the boys every night. It’s not good for their skin.
Those little babies are soooo cute!
I can’t stand these twi
I was waiting for Shane to make the glozelle shoutout 😂😂
okay so i do not have a baby but i badly want a baby brezza omg is that weird
I would have loved to see Ryland's reaction if he found out about the bread. I was literally waiting for a clip of that. let's just keep in mind it was made with love and the fact he chose to make a dessert because Shane is observant and noticed you love desserts more deserves a praise.🥹🥰
Waittttt Shane you have to make a dinner!! As a food network girl too I see you!!!
Okay y’all are the cutest dads! And I am here for chef Shane 👏🏻
Aw I love the babies 🥰 The little feet 😍 3 months is such a fun time. Should now be the time to tell you that once they start sleeping through the night they start teething? 😮 Also making baby food is super easy! Just make sure to invest in a good puree get a variety of organic fruits and veggies (I bought frozen but steamed some from scratch), put a little bit of water with the veggie/fruit of choice in the puree machine and make sure it gets turned to mushy liquid. I got little portion size cups with lids  and froze. Soooo much better then the junk they have in jars and cheaper too!
Im sorry if u fuq up in the future just remember if u can reheat and sour cream and cheese is the main component it will taste delish at the end of the night love u guys good night
The cinnabons looks good!! Cut the bottoms off they wont know
im literally crying, im so proud of you and shane!
YAAAS SHANE KEEP BAKING BE A CHEF YAAAS
seeing you guys in fatherhood is so amazing to see, you guys truly make it look easy. It’s crazy how fast the twins are growing & learning! So far my fav vlog! ❤
How is one baby not u ryland and one baby is not shane?! Omg they are i love all these videos i know u are concerned its too much baby activity but as the majority of us moms and committed dads we LOVE these videos
I thought babies aren’t supposed to have dairy before the age of one?
Your boys are so adorable ❤ Loved this video ❤❤
I love their little feeding noises!! Lol they are so loved and its so wonderful to watch i have a child and i enjoy every moment even tho sleep dont exist lol btw my child is SO picky hates every kind of meat only likes veggie nuggets, pizza, and pasta
Shane hun go to pintrist, probably spelt wrong but you'll get the instructions ❤❤❤❤
Shane I could definitely watch you cook, anytime! And those cinnamon bites looked AMAZING!!! Gonna have to try them made that way. Loved this video, and the boys are so precious and handsome!
I don't understand the cow milk and goat milk thing? I know things have changed a bit for baby's but I thought they couldn't have regular cows milk till the age of one? Not coming after anyone just a question ❤❤❤❤😊
Okay I gotta ask, why are you feeding them milk and not formula? Milk doesn’t have a lot of the vitamins that babies need?
I used to pop the baby bath in the shower with me and my daughter and I would just take a shower 😂and now shes 15months and  loves showers but doesnt know how to sit in a bath
Do you realize these boys are not robots? Damn, chill on the schedule a bit. Baby falls asleep 5 minutes before 4 and you want to wake him up to put him back down 5 minutes later...fml
I understand the routine. My friends used to always say “just keep him up” and I’d refuse because I wanted him on a schedule. He’s now 4 and knows his bath time every night and that bedtime is right after. I don’t regret keeping him on a schedule since day one!! It’s made it so easy. People will be like how do you get him to bed so fast and easily. Well because routine since the beginning❤️🫶🏼 Proud of you two!!
I just love watching you 2 as parents!❤❤❤❤❤😊
What are the stars called?
24:20  You know Shane does love having alot of things both ways 😉
Omg ß cute thank youfor letting me see
Hi Ryland! As a student studying nutrition, I wanted to let you know that it can be dangerous to give a baby cows milk before they are 12 months old! Love your videos :)
I just buy the ready to drink formula because my babies paediatrician told me the baby breezas have been known to use the wrong ratios for water to formula then what’s on the can and as we know if baby has too much water it can cause seizures 😢 so I put away my breeza until 6 months
omg the babies, baby fever for sure!
Shane : Hawaiian rolls 1/4 cup of cinnamon  1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup of unsalted butter 1/4 cup of heavy cream Mix and pour on cut rolls.   And for the drizzle,   1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup of cream cheese 1/4 cup of milk And your maple syrup 🫶🏼🤌🏼❣️
Shane ordering food after you cooked is absolutely BS... I see you Ryland... 😢
RYLAND! I am loving this! I have followed and loved your man’s channel from the beginning, then he met you, I fell in love with you and your channel, you two have grown together throughout the years and now all the friends, family and new Dad content!!!! I love it all, watching you guys now as Dads and Podcasters. I’M HERE FOR IT!!! Your style, edits, fails, gains, comedy, love… you’re always on point BayBee ❤🥳🥳
Okay I love how you don’t want to show them, but like THEY’RE SO FREAKING CUTE MY GOODNESS😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ IM DYING AT HOW CUTE THEY ARE
The babies are so precious!! And call me crazy but I feel like you can easily tell which baby belongs to which sperm! 😂
Totally relate to the routine/schedule and not wanting to de-rail it. My 2nd is just going on 9weeks and I've only JUST started being able to go more places with his and not be on absolute EDGE.  You guys seem to be coping so well and are parenting AMAZINGLY!❤🎉
Beautiful boys, such pretty faces. Such a beautiful stage, as they all are, but seeing them smile for the first time is such a beautiful thing.
Please let shane know that vanilla is absolutely measured with your heart  -with love from your local baker ;)
I love watching your videos especially now that you have the twins. My twins were born on dec. 20th so we are just a couple weeks behind your boys! Keep it up its hard but such an amazing experience!!!!
I had tears with the burnt cinnamon rolls 😂
We put cream cheese in w the filling and bake! Love you guys!
“A ploop?”🤣
Shane 'I'm going to make dinner from scratch tonight' *Proceeds to pour icing sugar mixture over store bought white bread.
I loved seeing Shane back talking to us like old times .. love daddy Shane lmaoo 😂
I care more about the crib placement than watching Shane pretend he cares more about his family than his views 😂
I wasn’t expecting to see either one of these little nuggets faces but when you did show the little man, oh my god did my heart melt! He is just the sweetest baby boy! You guys are doing an amazing job!❤
Shane watching you make those rolls was painful😂 please make the zucchini boats
thank you for showing glimpses of their faces. your boys are so cute!
Mark 8:36-37 (KJV)  For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
Have you heard of sleep feed so around 12ish pick them up while their asleep and feed them a bottle trying not to wake them and put them down again.
Your oven is so clean!!😮
so so happy for you both
I thought bathing a baby every night was bad for their skin?
I hope you have an incredible journey being parents ❤ much love and God bless you two! 🥰
27:40 truth
Omg the babies 😍
So cuteeee 🫶🏾
26:44 got him
A good sweet dessert is monkey bread or bubble bread. To make it easier get croissant packs and then you’ll make in a ball a quarter size or less. Then dunk the dough in melted butter and then put in a mixture of brown sugar, regular sugar, and cinnamon. Then put in a greased baking dish of whatever size and bake at 350 from 15 minutes to 30 minutes usually
love shane in that flannelllllll
Omg what a beautiful baby ❤❤ just the biggest eyes 😭 I miss when mine were that small
Oh my god I love seeing you guys on dad mode seeing the glimps of get and max they are the most beautiful babies ever ! ❤❤
Baby Brezza is one of the greatest inventions.
You guys remind me of Mitchell & Cam from modern family❤love it😂
Cooking with Ryland is my fave..I still watch those videos😊
Please take this strictly as informational and not shade, because it’s NOT shade, but it appears both boys are starting to get plagiocephaly. They are still young enough right now to remedy the problem and avoid them both needing helmets. Make sure they’re not spending significant amounts of time during the day laying on the back of their heads in their cribs, bouncers, car seats, pillows or strollers.  Make sure you’re rotating which direction they face when they feed so they don’t favor one side. Tummy time and dads holding them is key!   They seem very happy and loved— plagiocephaly is very common due to “back is best” sleeping guidelines. Just work to remedy it now while you can to avoid helmets (which they would have to wear 23 hours a day for at least 6 weeks!)   ❤
Shane: *talks shit about ryland burning the Christmas cinnamon rolls* Also Shane: *burns the Hawaiian cinnamon rolls*   Karma was quick 😂😂😂
You all are so in love and it’s adorable 😊
Ryland u r just soooooo cute. I cant 😂❤😂❤
One of my top favorite hottest thing someone can do is WINK and pull it off without trying hard. I like a subtle wink. I like a secretive wink. I like a cocky wink. I like when people can pull off a good wink. 34:21 and Shanes got it down perfectly.
30:30 you need to add heavy cream so they don’t burn
I miss your cooking videoes so much! I rewatch those videoes over and over again😂
Make anything.  I have a picky eater so I will take inspiration from anything that you cook.
OH MY GOD. that is the CUTEST baby i have ever seen in my entire life. those boys are so precious. i’m so happy for you guys!!!
Omg Ryland is so mentally superior to Shane, but Shane is smarter for choosing him as a partner. Works amazing for Shane 😇
The glozell cinnamon challenge shoutout😂💀😂💀
I haven't watched in a while, but it's so sweet watching ryland get so invested and be good with the babies ❤
Emma chamberlain editing vibes
What the heck does Shane actually do.  It looks like Ryland does most everything.
Jet’s little face 😭 omg so adorable!!!
I know you don’t want to show their faces online but I’m so happy I got to see their little faces 🥺 they’re so cute
I love both of you so much!! I love how you’re being careful as well with the babies and their identity! I won’t lie though I wanted to see their little baby faces smiling at the mobile! OH MY I STAND CORRECTED!! THEY ARE SO CUTE HOLY SHIT THEY ARE ADORABLE!you guys are gonna be such great fathers 🫶🏽
I'm not a parent but shouldn't they be getting formula and not cow and goat milk? Until they're 12 months?
OH MY GOD!!! They are so cute!!! Thank you for sharing ❤
Its.. mo-beal.. they're watching their mo-beal💙
Can you please do a video/series where you learn how to cook with Sandy???
Yess Hawaiin cinnamon buns are thee best! My boss makes them &brings them into work &they do not last long, especially cus my fatass eats 3 or 4 at a time 😂
I know this is rylands channel but without shame being on it now regularly it def wouldn’t be trending right now lol. Shane is the goat!!
Biscuits and gravy is an any time meal, Ryland. 😂
i cld be totally wrong so i have no clue but i thought babies shldnt have cow milk until theyre 1 yr old bc of the risk of intestinal bleeding, look into it bc im not 100% but good to check
oh my gosh that face in the tubbbbb cmon 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🩷🩷🩷
WOW Jet is definitely from Shane, it’s literally his face on a baby 😂 He’s so cute 😭❤️
Love you all, just a tip… don’t overdo it with the baths at their age. It can dry out their skin! It’s recommended only 2-3 times a week, and lots of moisturizer!
I had to pause when I saw the baby's face, why he's so perfect!! Im so happy for you guys ❤️ God bless your family 🥰
I always put fresh squeezed orange juice in my frosting it’s a game changer 😋
Love the baby daddy content so much ❤
Omg the bath scene I'm crying sooooo cute ❤❤❤
This is me when i try to cook or bake 😅  Stressed out at all the steps
You have the cutest babies I’ve ever seen
Shane plz make more cooking videos
omgggg i loveddd this video!! i love seeing you both in your dad era❤❤❤ you both are amazing! i have two boys myself and it's always busy busy between extra curricular activities and routines + work. always remember to practice self care. 💓 love you both!
Should they not be on formula stil?? I didn’t give my twins any other milk till they where one
You just needed some milk and a lot of powder sugar and a little big of valley syrup for the frosting
Definitely make cooking at home a priority for your sweet family! I Frito casserole or a hotdog and Mac and cheese kitchen will always smell better than a Postmates kitchen and your boys will be better for it 🫶 Nothing wrong with keeping it simple!
omg i would watch you cook.
Ugh I melted when I saw baby!!!! You guys are doing an amazing job so proud of you!!! ❤
I for one love the baby content, they are so adorable!!!
This video was fun yall I really enjoyed it 😍😍
Shane we need to see you make an actual dinner now 4 course 😉
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life Romans 10:9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
As a mum myself I get not showing them but my heart when you showed him in the bath my goodness so cute! Also the different views of Shane in the kitchen and then ryland getting emotional had my dying I love you guys so proud of you ❤️❤️
Omg they are so beautiful
Can't believe how cute your babes are ❤ My daughter (6) and I made those cinnamon rolls today after watching you guys last night......so damn good!
I honestly love the little glimpses of their faces, without you constantly showing them! I think the just little bit we saw after the bath was perfect. Not too much, just a quick peek!
im 20 years old and have BIG baby fever so thank you Ryland & Shane for letting me live it out through you two🩵🩵😂
Imagine the boys looking back at this when there older like man I was so cute.
There so cute I can’t
You can’t tell me jet is 100% Rylands they look identical the lips nose.
I didn’t know you could feed baby’s cow and goat milk; Is it mixed with formula?
These queens use to say not us not us doing the baby vlogs.but they are thirsty ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cooking already cooked rolls for 20 minutes!? 😮
jet in the bath!!! omg they’re so CUTEEE
Ryland wondering why Shane doesn’t cook for him. Then Ryland hating on every idea, not liking him using the oven or pots 🤦🏻‍♀️
I vote we see more of Shane domesticating it up in the kitchen. It’s a perfect time to learn babyyyy
That’s the cutest baby I’ve ever seen in my entire life
Ryland! Google baby bath flower 🌼 🌸 life changer ❤
one of the boys burp like Shane and one of the boys looks like Ryland. THEY ARE SOO CUTE
Goat milk?! Whaaaaat
“Who’s texting me? Oh it’s Gordon Ramsay He’s Shook” 😂😂
Shane you need to add alittle heavy cream to the Hawaiian cinnamon rolls before you bake them  bc then it’s super Mosit 🤤🤤🤤
Jet is so cute omg! He’s so calm during bath time too.
Hotdogs, chopped up in macaroni and cheese, is my all-time favourite meal
You guys are doing great. Keep up the good work in being awesome dads. ❤
Omg I’m so glad you showed the baby he’s the cutest lil baby ever and I’m sure brother is the same. My babies are all grown now in their twenties and now I have 6 grandkids and I’m not even 50 yet!! The swaddling will likely stop soon it’s typically when they try to start to roll over between 2-4 months on average. Your doing great keeping them on a schedule that is so helpful for them and you! They seem like pretty happy babies!! Fun vlog!
Being in the limelight you guys are better off showing the boys your selves instead of dumbasses making it dangerous trying to get the shots.
so how are the llamas doing...
Jet looks like Shane ! So adorable. Start cooking small meals I can’t image eating out for all meals. You guys got this.
Ryland was born to be a Dad, what natural ❤
Where is Shane’s Doberman T-shirt from!?
CHEF SHANE! WE WANT MORE!!
MY GOD YOUR BABIES ARE SO ADORABLE!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Jet looks just like Shane. He has his eyes, there's no denying it 😍 I died when he said "they're burnt " 🤣 but then he PICKED himself up by the boot straps & made it work! 👨‍🍳
No one cares get off the internet
Not Shane's faces cracking me up over here! 😂 I want more shane the cook videos please!!
Why don’t you guys try testing different crockpot meals?! 😊❤
the little food critic moment where ryland is telling shane how good the rolls are but also confirming how perfectly shane knows ryland with everything he said is jsut the cutest thing omfg ❤❤😭😭
They are lucky to have you Ryland.
It’s kinda monkey bread lol 😂
Being a parent is being a part time clown to make them laugh and smile as much as possible
Holy crap!!!! Those babies are SOOOO cute!!!!!!!!
I used seat geek to take my daughter to see Enhyphen in April I hope to God it comes through does anyone have experience with it?
Was really hoping Shane would actually make dinner instead of a dessert. Cute vlog though! Ryland is such a good dad!
27:47 when it is too sweet add 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and it will make it better
So I have a question why milk not formula??? Curious. Also a new mom here
I am literally running down to KfC right now!
*I WANT TO SEE MORE COOKING FROM SHANE*  🥺
“I was thinkin with this fuc**** noggin” *taps head* 😂😂😂😂
I got the same outfits for my son too! 🥹
His little faceeeee omg🥰🥰
Ohhh my goodness my little man is the same age as your babies & I just want to give you two props for being great daddies
I love that you take them on walks, my little one and I used to take a walk every day it was nice outside lol
I knew Ryland would be an incredible, organized, efficient daddy,which I LOVE! But I did not expect Shane to be so calm and relaxed with the babies!!! They’re the best daddies in the world !
I don't care how good or not good Shane is at cooking, I think this should be his new thing. Entertained through the whole thing! I would watch every episode of that cooking show as soon as it came out on his YT channel.
Thank you for giving us a sneak peak of their sweet face! 🥺😍❤️  But I also greatly appreciate you not shoving their faces on camera as well! You guys are great dads!!!!
Where does Ryland get his energy from? hes a powerhouse
Wait…. Back when my babies were infants, my doctor (and everyone else) said no animal milk (cows nor goat) until one year old. Is that not the rule anymore? Did that change in the last 18 years?
Chris looks so Adorable
I need the semi exact recipe for the cinnamon bites because Shane, they look incredible!
I loved this video!!!! more videos with Shane cooking for Ryland!!!!!
Dont leave cardboard on-the gas stove top love you guys be safe!
If you ever come to Utah...you have to come to Batch Baked Goods. They have gourmet cinnamon rolls with different flavors, each month they switch. But their classic cinnamon roll is to die for!
9:58 me lol
Rylan is a great dad
OMG I just received my Shane Dawson merch!!! Mystery hoodie!!! Are you kidding me ? I LOVE IT !! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT !!! THANK YOU SO MUCH SHANE AND RYLAND. I was definitely feeling sad and this mystery hoodie made my day I am so happy now !! I was so excited to pick the mystery hoodie. I had no idea what I was going to get and I'm obsessed! I will be ordering the new red ♥️. Thank you for making my day!!! Keep doing you because your making a difference in people's lives. 🥰🥰
Why is Shane not helping u feed the babies why r u always pushing the stroller u gona be a single mom sorry 😅
As someone who used to hate cooking I must say practice is key. I started to force myself to cook, and now I must say I really enjoy it. You will also start to develop better instincts for it as well which will help. Yay podcast and Vlog in one day 🎉🎉 also, highly recommend the viral TikTok cinnamon roll recipe 🤤
You guys were blessed with the cutest boys ever ! 😍♥️
Disgusting
Okay love love everything I watch of u guys but cutting off the babies faces? Bummed. Not to mention they are babies and all babies look like babies lol they aren't gonna be like MJ recognizable! Lol Look at how bad it turned out for MJ! I don't think the twins are targeted to the point they need to be cut off.  I'm not super opinionated and have to comment on shit but I was so happy u didn't blur them when they were born! So to watch this & now they're cut off.... Bummed lol And frustrated if u guys are forced to think it's needed
I literally just shed a tear 🥹 seeing that sweet angel babys cute yiddle face! what a cutie! 💙 I’m seriously so proud of you two boy daddies 🥰 Also, Shane! If you’re looking it ain’t cooking use that on Ryland hahah 😜
How old were you when you realized that you can copy comments by clicking them 3 times?
Wow they are absolutely beautiful babies 😍
Oh my gosh, Jet and Max are the cutest! Please never stop doing dad vlogs, loving them 😍
I must say those two boys are so VERY LUCKY to have such wonderful Dads that love them so much and take such wonderful care of them.  They are so sweet, and handsome but the best thing is that they are so chill, comfortable, and understand how much they are loved!!
Does anyone know the brand of the crib they have?
Pleaseeeeeeeee start using the stroller seats not the car seats for walks It’s not good for the babies if you are not going in the car. ❤
Shane you need to try sticky buns or monkey bread next!!!
! Best, Very Best
Shane you just need practice. Trust me you do what we all do. You did amazingly and kept going. Thats what its all about! ❤   Like i mastered fettuccine alfredo and Pizza. 😂😂 I had to wing it so many times. I even know the lazy version of both to get it to taste like the other.
Shane, come pick me up, I’ll teach you how to bake with yeast 💁🏼‍♀️
As a mom it’s so hard not wanting to post your babies but those whittle facess have me dead🥹🥹
You got it right about everyone will do what works for them but as a mom of twins Yeppers a schedule was a must!!! Just be prepared for the 4mo regression that often happens - they snap back out of it. And, yes that face was tooo adorable to not share! Love the cinna bites
His little face omg I’m crying over here! Thank you guys for letting us be apart of your lives 🥹🥰
HI GUYS I LOVE YOU GUYS
New era of shane in the kitchen and im here for it
SHANE you need to follow the Tasty homemade cinnamon rolls video to make the best and most delicious cinnamon rolls ever!!
Dang, Shane really didn’t make dinner? :/ Ryland does so much
Omg he is he adorable I cannot😭🩷
DEM BABIESSSS 😍 Love that the vlog is about your life and not just about the babies! Great job at keeping the routines intact!
those onesies are epic! im so jealous
When Shane said he used to cook a lot before he met Ryland ..all I kept picturing was him microwaving a Barbie from back in the day 😂
I love how this went from making a homecooked meal to making just cinnamon buns 😂😂😂 I relate too much to this this is why my husband plans our dinners. And cooks them lmao   I do bake though. I make some pretty amazing desserts tbh.
Shane you should try to make pizza bubble bread. Its delicious and easy. Get dinner rolls (it actually doesn't work as well with the layer ones has to be normal biscuits, presliced in the tube. Take each slice and cut it into fours. Put in a bowl and mix with pizza sauce and cheese and whatever other pizza toppings you like, mix it all up, and pour onto a baking sheet. Spread as evenly as you can with this lumpy mixture and then add more cheese on top and bake at like 400/425 until the center isnt doughy. Voila. Its like monkey bread but pizza and its so good lol
One small moment. With a lifetime of memories. ❤
They give me such Mitch and cam vibes 😭❣️
Shane that is not cooking 😂
19:20 SOOO SWEEET  LOVEE A SNIPPET OF THEIR FACES 19:48
5:18 omg Rylan you were right on Shane’s podcast! They’re little dumplings😭😭 so ADORABLE🫶🏻🫶🏻 so happy for y’all!!!!
Try to put them on the top shelf of the oven. Maybe they won't burn.
When Shane said were leaving them in for 20 minutes I wanted to scream NOOOOOOO!!! Lmao
Ryland, you are such a good parent!
I really liked the editing on this video. And Shane’s parts were so good and funny
How is Ryan being such a good mommy, but also such a daddy at the same time. Shane is just chilling and being the fun dad.
Okay we officially NEED a Shane cooking/baking channel. 🤣❤️ PLEAASSSEEE
Watching Shane “cook” was a mess 😂
Love this video ❤
I swear by routine! My eldest is 10!! And is still in the same bedtime routine, i had it rock soild from when he was 2 weeks old! Always trust your gut with them, i absolutely LOVE watching you guys learn about being dads, i love you guys so much, couldnt be happier for you both, also, Shane, i want to see you cook!!!
My neph is 3 months! He’ll be 4 April 1st. They are so cute!
Okay we need a link for that baby mobile if it is a lifesaver because I NEED IT 😅
Time for Shane to enter his sourdough era!!
Please go to night two in Miami I would die meeting you
19:26 that has to be the cutest little baby boy I have ever seen oh my goodnesssssss 😢❤️
it's the edited sound effects for me every single video lol I love it
Omgosh they are so cute!!! Love the little peek! ❤
are those outfits Lizzie approved?
What great parents you are! You guys look so happy, and have such a beautiful family 💙
Shane making monkey bread with extra steps. 😂
I love the Great Dane shirt, and you babies are adorable
I laugh scream when sahen said " food network was my ipad"😂😂😂 love it because sameeeeeee😂. Yall are amazing parents!!
I know my SIL was also so strict about having her twins on a schedule when they were babies, it was the key to her sanity. Anytime my mom and I would babysit them we would try so hard to keep them on their schedule so they wouldn’t be ‘off’ whenever she got them back.😅
Our babies are exactly a week apart my baby Archie was born on the 14th of December and I feel like they’re growing up together in a way! Just watching this video and Ry saying about how he feels time has flown by so far since the beginning finding out about the pregnancy to now, put tears in my eyes. I’m so happy to have a influencer that’s on the same page as me, I’ve watched Shane since middle school and just seeing you guys grow so much over the years and relating to you both every step of the way you’re like my besties 😂 I love you all ❤
I’ve never been one to be entertained by family vlogs but watching you and Shane be such amazing dads brings tears to my eyes🥹 Also can we talk about how UNBELIEVABLY CUTE they both are!!
Such a cute vlog but seriously… Shane attempting to make cream cheese icing made me cringe 😂 it’s the effort that counts lol
shane should do a cooking series on his channel and come full circle from his old creations lollll
I never though making cinnamon roll filling could be so chaotic and comical I’m SCREAMING
The babies look so much like shane😮😅
14:37 using a recipe isnt cheating you're still cooking the food lmao cheating would be going and buying already made food and coming home and heating it up 😂
I love Shane and Rylands dynamic. Ryland being practical sorting the cots then Shane showing their new outfits haha ❤
i know spencers straight and chris has a boyfriend but im shipping.
I’m alllll here for Shane’s Cooking Era 👩🏼‍🍳💋 coming from a baker, turn down the oven a bit next time to “slow cook” the cinnamon goodness, sugar burns super fast! Love y’all so much! 🫶🏼
This whole podcast/video was so cute/sweet and adorbs. The babies are so precious and seem so calm and happy. 😊  Genuinely happy for you guys and your little family ❤.
Awh those tiny little adorable faces you guys are the best daddies ever and you have the most beautiful adorable babies so happy for you guys 💞
A LIL PEAK AT THAT PERFECT BOY OMGGGGGG I FEEL LIKE I CANT EVEN CURSE HES SO PRECIOUS YOU GUYYYYSUH
Shane not knowing what made “from scratch” means.    I’ve seen Ryland “cook” - it’s actually amazing that he outranks his husband in kitchen skill.  These men own 2 fancy kitchens for take out.
I recently learned that babies fourm habits by you doing the exact same thing three times in a raw it then because routine for them I never knew that and my son is 12 😂
Not me sitting here crying watching daddy Ryan give them a bath and when I tell you they are the cutest little baby boys I’ve ever seen Omg 🥹 I’m so happy and proud of you guys ❤❤
OMG WHEN YOU SHOWED THIER FACE. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 I respect everything your doing with their privacy but a lil sneak of that amount of cuteness is always appreciated. Brought a huge smile to my face!
Hey daddys so this is like a oh shit moment all parents have if they are not told, i had this, so with baby and infant feeding if you have the bottle tipped up in the air the flow is very very high, if its more parallel its a slower flow, maybe with mr picky I forgot which you just said ate goats milk, but the fast flow of milk can always always upset a lil guys tummy
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Get saved now before it’s too late! John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

You should do a day in the life as a stay at home dad 🤗❤️
I love that I can click out of this video and still have it playing while on diff apps but why is it the only video that does this? ( I don’t have premium)
My heart! Both of your boys are so adorable and sweet! I’m so freaking happy for you all!! ❤🎉❤🎉
Your boys are so adorable. Loved the true delight when Ryland ate Shane's "Cinna bites". Lol.  I think Shane should do a little cameo cooking for Ryland!!
Omg you guys are so cute and cooking with Shane is my new favorite food show... please do more :D  ... and thank you for sharing the boys they are so adorable! <3
Love u guys 😭💕
I look forward to your mommy content so much! I love you and Shane ❤ I have a 8 month old son but I’ve been watching for years 😊 I feel like we are going on this journey together
My jaw literally dropped they are SOOOOOO CUTE
i love that you don't show anything in the tub!!! that is so important, as parents we never know who is watching and whos being weird, so proud of you both! only thing id change is camera angles for when you do record them, that's all. just another mom looking out for y'all. love ya both
You’re a terrible sous chef! 😂 😂😂
Hey Ryland...my baby is due in October and I'm going to need you to come to AZ and build my crib and decorate my nursery for me 😂. You're seriously so good at building, creating and designing!
Oh Ryland, your face when they were crying at the same time. Just wait until they're both trying to talk to you at the same time. I have a 9 year old and a 2 year old and then talking to me at the same time drives me crazy. Especially in the car it gets so crazy in the car. Good luck y'all! Y'all are doing great and I love seeing y'all as parents!!!
I feel like they are doing a perfect job with the amount of baby content they have. Like they are not switching to becoming a cheesy family channel but at the same time they are parents now so it's obvious they're going to talk about, reference and occasionally show them. I personally wish I could see them a "little" more strictly because I've been following Shane since 2010 so I've basically gone through all of my adulthood with him as well as watched him through the creation of my own family so I feel close to them in a way. (I know, sounds weird)   My kid asked me the other day if I could spend the day with any celebrity I want who would it be and without skipping a beat I was like "I want to hang out with Shane, Ryland and the crew just for an entire day. Not even doing anything crazy just hanging at the house watching a movie/YouTube and joking around xoxo.   You guys are doing a FANTASTIC job as parents. Don't let anyone make you feel any differently. You know your true supporters. Love you guys xoxo
Tell Shane in order for the boys to wear those cute outfits he loves, they will HAVE to go outside 😂
I knew Shane wasn’t going to actually cook lol
You guys are such great parents❤
I love how much content we've been getting lately this is way better then any kind of regular TV show ❤❤❤
I am so excited to hear the belly laughs! Nothing else in this word compares to the happiness that radiates in a room with a baby doing a belly laugh. It is the best thing ever.
When you showed his sweet face I  MELTEDDDD😍😍😍🥹🥹🥹
Lucky you guys! I wish my baby would sleep that well during the nights and be as “easy” as they seems to be!
JET IS SHANE !!! Shane’s the dad
Also, now I neeeeed more Shane cooking videos!! <3
Shane you need to get outside more often and get some of that Vitamin D from the Sun. It will help with your depression. It helps with mine.
the amount of ads and affiliates it’s one video is mind boggling
Omg your babies are so damn cuteeeeeee ❤
The babies are literally the cutest 🥹❤️ I am so proud of Ryland and Shane they’re doing great!!
Ryland, if you tape shiny ribbon or streamers from the ceiling fan and put it on the lowest speed, it will also be hours entertainment. I have 3 boys andevery one of them were obsessed with the ceiling fan.
Ryland and Shane are my happy place. ❤ I am currently in the kitchen at the counter, eating a bowl of Ramen, watching my baby on the monitor as she sleeps, while my son takes over my bedroom watching his tablet. I love being a mom 😊
Cutest lil one
I Have to know about those stars in the boys room!!!!
My anxiety CANNOT handle  Shane cooking
Oooh slumber party podcast is such a good idea! Ahh I'm so excited to see and I'm so glad Sandy will be there 😊
I love da wittle babies! Shane I’m gonna need more chefs content please!
Ryland is an awesome daddy!
This is a note for Shane and Ryland - Crockpot recipes will save your life! I'm busy all day with work and school, I can only imagine with babies, but most recipes you just throw everything in and let it sit for a few hours <3 Might save ya a bunch of time and accomplish the home cooked meals!
Chizza is chicken parmesan with pepperoni.
I think the subtle touches are perfect of showing the baby! When I tell you I screamed when I seen one of the babies faces. SO FREAKING CUTE, DO YOU HEAR ME!!!!!!!
I literally thought Shane was going to cook I got excited about the video….😔😢
Idk why I’m guessing jets Ryland genes 🧬 and max is Shane’s genes 🧬 idk why but I can’t wait to find out!!!!
I can’t wait to know witch one has Shane’s genes and then which one has Ryland’s genes 🧬 I wish they would just tell us!!! 💜💜💜💜
Awe Shane saying he's not a good dad hurt. I have a new baby too, you are a good dad Shane lol. You are both doing great.
Idk why you think you can't use recipes to prove you can cook lol. That's the same thinking as people saying using references is cheating for drawing. It's how you learn! Your brain gathers information each time you use a recipe and eventually you won't need recipes for things you've cooked frequently and can experiment.
5:24 - 5:38 literally me
Listen, I will watch a vlog about you and Shane talking about your boys anytime! I also had my little boy just two weeks before yours, so they are on the same milestones! It just feels like I have someone to relate to 🤣 y’all are doing great 🫶🏼
I love shane cooking
Beautiful vid both of you and Shane love the idea for the Hawaiian rolls!! One thing may help I've learned with extremely sweet things like frosting. Try maybe a dash of salt really fine but helps a bit with really really sweet stuff ❤️❤️❤️❤️ love you all !!
My only unsolicited parenting advice is: every baby is different and do whatever works for you/them! Every age and phase is different 💕🫶🏼
You two are amazing dads🥹🥹🥹 such a beautiful family
Omg those babies are so stinkin cuuutteee ❤️
I love everything in this Video 😮❤
The solid starts or feeding littles courses are awesome and have lots of meal ideas 😊 solids is so fun but messy lol
Omg! I'm in love. You giving me so much baby fever mine is far to old to start over.
Omg that is the cutest freaking baby!!!! Totally understand not showing them but I melted when you did, so sweet 🥰
they’re so cute 😊😊😊
You’re a great Mom Ryland!
No formula? Is that a thing? I thought it was important for formula the first 6-8 months
You guys are such awesome dads💕💕
I STAYED in the house the whole first year of both my boys lives. We weren’t risking that messed up schedule life. Noooo way 😅😂
You guys make raising twins look easy! Great job 👏🏼
Halfway through the video here...how did we go from Shane finally going to cook dinner for Ryland, to Shane deciding to make a dessert HE has always wanted to try. Seriously, he makes everything about himself...
I want to see the zucchini boats!!
Loved the Shane cooking segment and I think the way you are filming the babies is perfect and tasteful feel free to show more if you want but not pressured! ❤
SO happy to see you guys as parents i know they’re gonna have the best life raised by the best dads 🩷 i’ve been watching yall forever and it’s so heartwarming to see the family yall have made ❤
You and Shane are wonderful  dads.  I love you guys so much.
Ryland talking about how crazy it is to have 3 month old babies and how much they interact now while I’m sitting on my couch with my 9 month old sleeping on me… hit me hard 🥲 the days start coming and they don’t stop!!!!
Thank you for sharing a glimpse of your cuties! I cannot wait for my fiance and I to become parents! As a cook/baker, when Shane added maple syrup instead of vanilla I was actually kinda proud cause that’s the next best thing to add in icing if you don’t have vanilla or just didn’t know 😅❤
LOVE LOVE U GUYS❤❤❤
Routine is amazing I wish I had done that or was able to when I had my son but I lived with my mom and she ruined any possibility of routine lol and omg the babies are so cute with the little bit that we saw 🥰
I felt so bad when Shane burnt the cinnamon buns! The editing was on point lol! When Shane was leaving side comments to the viewers and Ryland had no idea what we all just went through 😂
No hate from me BUT cinnamon AND vanilla extract are both super potent so be cautious with those. lol.   Also make sure you scroll all the way down on recipes because sometimes the amounts of each ingredient is way down under a bunch of nonsense.
Shane needs to start a cooking series! I would love to help him out and make it really approachable to be a little Susie homemaker for his boys!
Baking is rough don't give up on it Shane.
omg his little face when he was in the bath!!!! my ovaries hurt
ME TOO❤
*Deconstructed* cinnamon rolls
As Shane began to cook,🤣 i knew it will be a Desaster 🥴
i do care about tje shelves and zucchini boats! lol we love the stuff ryland gives us.
2:05 oh not jared ready for it !!!
You guys are doing a great job filming with them around, while not having them the center of attention. It keeps the focus on you guys while we get the cutest little glimpses of the boys ❤
DO SWEDISH CINNAMON ROLL a.k.a the real one (KANELBULLE) I will write a recepe but you need to convert it to american measure.  Pleas do it it is soo good if you do it right!!  PS love from gothenburg<3   Dough 25 g, of yeast 50 g, butter  3 dl, milk 1/2 dl,  granulated sugar 1 krm, salt 8 dl, wheat flour  Dough: Crumble the yeast in a bowl. Melt the butter in a saucepan.  Add the milk and heat until finger warm (37°C).  Pour some of the dough liquid over the yeast and stir until it dissolves.  Add the rest of the dough liquid, sugar, salt and almost all the wheat flour, saving a little for baking.  Work the dough smoothly by hand or in a machine until the dough leaves the edges of the bowl.  Let the dough rise, covered, for approx. 30 min.    Filling 100 g, room temperature butter or margarine 1 msk, ground cinnamon 1 dl, caster sugar (If you like a lot of filling, it's fine to double the amount)  Filling: Leave the butter out so that it is soft and at room temperature and then stir it  with cinnamon and sugar.  Take the dough out onto the workbench and knead it smoothly with the remaining flour.  Roll out the dough into a plate, approx. 30x40 cm (for 20 pieces).  Spread on the filling,  -  And this is my trick, crumble over almond paste. This makes the cinnamon buns taste really good ;) Then roll up from the long side.  Cut the roll into pieces about 2 cm wide.  Place the pieces with the cut surface facing up on a parchment-lined baking sheet or in paper bun forms. Let the buns rise under a baking sheet for approx. 20 min.    Brushing egg pearl sugar  Brushing: Brush the buns with beaten egg and sprinkle with a little granulated sugar.  Bake the buns in the middle of the oven at 250°C, approx. 8 min.  Leave to cool on a wire rack under a baking sheet.  Then it's time to eat them :)
Watching you guys actually being parents after talking about it foe years makes me so happy that I have tears.
Spencer  looks  like he could be Shane’s brother 😭
Hellofresh please sponsor them again 😂😂😂jk
I like your approach with the babies is not “selling” their faces on the internet just give us a view from the parent perspective and is a lot better. Shane cooking video is the sweetest thing ever!!  I laughed a lot!
i am obsessed!!!!! you guys are doing amazing as parents and can’t wait for more of similar content like this !
I looooove seeing this domesticated side of Shane!! I love the family vlogs the twins are the cutest!! 🩷
I can’t help but be greedy and want to see their adorable little faces! And omg they are absolutely adorable! I do understand wanting to keep their privacy but I do agree with a few comments I saw where you aren’t making them the focus. You are living your lives and they are the biggest part now!! Oh my goodness bath time when Ryland turned him around I was in love, seeing that adorable little face. Thank you for sharing this beautiful time with us!!
No, Shane. We want to watch Ryland enjoy whatever you cook. It doesn't need to be pretty. Most food isn't pretty.
I love the cheeto appearances ❤
I worry about the internet haters knowing what your kid looks like and their names. Not to mention the creeps out there. Also what they might say when they get older and see themselves in videos. Half censored, half not. Like not as bad as family vlog channels but still not 100 without showing the babies. Its a tough line to draw that boundry. Just be careful with social media. It's a new age, different worries as parents. I have been a fan for a while, so I  say this with love, not mallace. I hope for the best and stay safe.
omg!! 😱 Can anybody please tell me where I can get the black shirt with the great dane on it that Shane is wearing?!??? I NEED IT!!!!😍
My burning question is: is one of them looking like Shane and one of them like Ryland already? Can you tell? Not that it matters but it's so interesting!
Loved that Ryland still enjoyed the food Shane made 😊 looking forward to an actual cooking dinner video from Shane!
What is frito casserole 👀👀👀 I want
Ryland I’m literally sobbing they are the cutest babies ever I’m so freaking happy for you and Shane! Watched for Shane for almost a decade now and you for a few years It’s such a pleasure to see you guys enter parenthood ❤
OMG. The last scene where Ryland is tasting the cinabites is so cute and funny.  Dancing Ryland is so cute and Shane's happy dance and Shane's face at the end was so funny.  😂😂😂
Omggggg!!!!!! When u showed Jet's face!!!! Omg such a cuuuute boy!!!!! How could u resist!!?? At first I was like "oh no! Did they forget!!??" Omg how adorable! What a beautiful whittle whittles!!!!!!
Thank you for sharing these special moments with us! i love seeing the boys and you are great dads!!
I think Jet is Rylands biological son.  He looks exactly like Ryland!  Just a thought… 🤔……I know it makes no difference, but his little face looks like Rylands.  🥰
Omg he is so precious...i respect that yins don't want to put them on the internet but as a mom of 2 boys, I really appreciate the little sneak peeks you give us..still watching, but I had to stop and say that. 🥰he is seriously the sweetest little peanut ❤
Jet looks like Shane
Shane should do a 'cooking with Shane' series
STOP MY DUAGHTER HAS THOSE WINNY THE POOH OVERALLS
I don’t get, it why is it dangerous to show them?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
How did you guys create their sleep schedule I had my newborn baby girl on the end of Feb and I have no idea how to keep her up in the day and create her sleep schedule especially when she experiences mental leaps in the future! Love u guys!
The boys are growing so fast. They are both so beautiful. What lovely parents you two are! Love watching these vlogs. Also, how lovely to have this documented for when they are older. You are both doing a great job. Keep smashing it! lots of love from England Xx
I personally respect so much your choice of not showing the babies: this is your life and it's your choice what to film or not, we are here for the ride. (omg the baby is so cute he looks like shane!!!)
Shane, I just love everything you do!  You always make me laugh 😂 Ryland your vlogs are my absolute favorite thing to watch and your boys are adorable 💙💙
So much cuteness ❤😊
Lmao this whole video had me lol.  The entire post mate- dessert reveal 😂
can we pleaseee get a Shane cooking show of him cooking dinner pleaseeee 😭😂🙏🏼
Side note: I too LOVE STUFFED PEPPERS Ryland 😂😂😂😂
Does Shane do much with the babies? Getting the vibe it’s more ryland 😢
As a Canadian, seeing Shane discover the magic of maple syrup was a highlight 😂
Loved this today ❤ we need a 'Shane's Cooking Channel' !!!! With Ryland being the judge each time xx
Loved this vlog!
Wait till y’all discover twin language when they get older lol twins are known to sometimes develop a secret language between each other as toddlers even though it’s babble or even when they get older cause my twin brother and I have this secret babble language that sounds like absolute nonsense but we fully understand each other it’s crazy lol
Shane, I totally see you in your journey to become a Cook. I think it fits you because you're so creative and you're not afraid of trying new recepies and flavors. Also the babies are SO cute, I can't. I loved this vlog, guys. ❤
Ryland repeating everything shane already said😂❤ true soulmates
Ryland, you are so balanced.  And watching your videos are  interesting without being that bragging parent.  I got such a joy seeing you interact with the boys.  Such happy babies, and healthy looking too.  I know you showed their faces for a moment,  and you'd like to keep them off the Internet and I totally respect that.  However I for one loved seeing the boys faces for a moment.  It makes it even more relatable and enduring for this of us who no longer have babies.  But we remember.  You're a great  dad, both of you are.
The babies sooo cute.
I can't wait feeding was my favorite I did baby led weaning!!!! And made my own purees,  my son never ate canned baby food. We started at 6 months❤
Make a series of cooking with Shane would love love to watch that
You guys should try something like HELLO FRESH! When we tried it we fell in love.. great way to eat healthy and the recipes are delicious it’s no joke!
Shane acting like a helpless idiot isn't cute anymore now that he's a father.
You are both amazing dads!!!!
Oh my goodness the boys are soooo cute! Thank you for letting me see.
Omg Shane’s brother looks like Avid Merrin / the Bear  from Bo Selcta 😂😂😂😂😂
I can just tell ryland has a special bond with jet ❤️ so special seeing you guys being dad's
I LOVE that the whole gang is there makes me so happy ❤❤
I can't believe it's been 3 months already?!?!
Such a fun episode! I want those stars! Can you link where I might find them?
So freaking cute seeing shane withboys
I was in the middle of this and my dog had her puppies
Truly not trying to judge or anything. When you said cows milk and goats milk I was surprised because i am almost positive that goats milk isn't safe for infants and cows milk isn't safe until they are a year old. I do assume you've done research and have talked to providers so i could wrong just don't want you two to run into any health issues with the babies. I was also told bathing  babies everyday isn't good for their skin either. Of course everyone does things different and parenting is not easy. I wish the best for yall and for happy, healthy babies.
The babies r beautiful...... Looks like Ryland does way more as Daddy duties. 🎉💙💙
"I can cook" proceeds to make a hacked recipe lol
Power couple goals
Truly so great seeing u two as parents best dads 💕babies are adorable loving Shanes cooking era my favorite vlogs everyday life
We need more of Shane’s cooking - had me laughing so hard 😂
I really wanna see a Mr. Kate collab designing ur nursery huhuhu
This has been one of my most favorite video I’ve seen of y’all. So sweet and Shane had me literally LOL at the end.
Both Jet and Max  are adorably handsome! So precious! You can see the love that y’all have for your twins! I loved watching Shane bake cinnamon rolls Shane you should do more cooking! This video is beyond adorable!
I NEED to see those zucchini boats! That is an exciting food are you kidding I want THAT
It’s chicken parmesan with pepperoni.
Are they identical twins or no ❤️so freaking cute
I feel like Shane took the easy way out because he can’t cook real food lol 💀
Ok I am calling for a Shane Dawson cooking show!!! Trying new things every week!! Who agrees?? Maybe have special guests.. I would love to come show you how to make some stuff y’all would love. ❤😂
I love them so much🥹😍 watching y’all be parents makes me so happy! They are so freaking cute it makes my heart want to explode 💕 y’all are great parents and I’m so happy for y’all! Thank you for updating us on them 🥹💞
Ryland I was in fact wondering and I must say I prefer the way you placed the cribs in the beginning
Wowww you guys are really killing it, baby is soooo cute I melttedddd he is so handsome like his dadas!
Just a heads up bathing the babies every day can dry out there skin even though you moisturize their skin, obviously every parent is different and you do what works for you but every other day is sufficient.
aaw i feel like they would wanna sleep next to eachother right :')
NO wonder rylans is so thin he is so active, putting the cribs together, walking etc! Loved this video. I need one of those breeze bottle things never heard of it.
Omg his little face!!!!!! Urgh he’s so cute I can’t ❤
19:24 OMG HE’S SO FREAKING CUTE🥹🥹🥹
❤❤❤❤❤So wonderful the who video was a vibe! Your voth wonderful  parents! 🎉So ur babies are giving me baby fever and i have a 4 year old. Bath time cameo was everything ❤❤❤❤❤❤
They are so dang cute this is the best video just seeing how happy you two are in normal life 😭🙏❤
You should try "Hello Fresh" its soo easy and soo good😊
i always laughed at people that said shane and ryland wouldn’t be good parents. i had faith in y’all and y’all delivered!!
Those boys are so precious!!! Shane just a quick note do you have sleep apena cus my heart will beat like that sometimes when i wake up and i have it.
Thank you for sharing your lives . Such a feel good video❤
The pictures above the stove just shows y’all don’t cook omg Hahaha love yall and all the videos 🥰
Ryland, when burping the baby cup your hand
Thank you for welcoming us into your lives with the babies. They are so stinking cute. Even though having a baby let alone having twins is no easy task you guys are making it look like a breeze. I envy your organization and the schedules are going to make yours and babies lives so much easier. I enjoy your vlogs so much. Your doing an amazing job💕
I was having a rough day today and watching this video made me feel better thank you Ryland and Shane for that keep doing these types of videos please
Tell Shane to make a channel where he cooks normal home meals. Extra monies and he gets a new hobby.
They are sooooooooooooo adorable! 😍
OMFG YES! Lol, So relatable! Spending two hours cooking store bought rolls. Love it.
I can't do Taylor. Or the swifties. Lol
I love you guys  This made my whole day ❤️❤️
RYLAND, whay is that baby bed mat upside-down? You do too much...calm down
Cant wait for more family vlogs!! This is by far one of my favorite vlogs on the channel and congratulations to you and Shane again on your beautiful baby boys Max and Jet❤❤
Come back to Colorado....those precious angel babies dont need the toxicity of Cali.
YALLS house is not a home full of cords for the babies. Film in the shed for gods sake.
IM SO SICK OF HEARING ABOUT TAYLOR...her music sucks
The babies are gorgeous, I love Shane an ryland the ending had me giggling 😂❤❤❤
the emotions watching this vlog were  " awwwww" and "lmao"
Omg babies are soooo cute!!!! Thank you for showing!! Awwwwwwwww 🥰
Precious babies! ❤
I need more content like this
Zucchini boats!!!!
Yeah anyone could of told ya 20 mins would be to much unless it was like at 200 degrees
Do you not give them formula? I thought you weren't supposed to give babies milk milk till they were older like at least 2 years old
It's called Frito pie! A staple of my East Texas childhood.
Ong you show them all the time on accident and we live to see those beautiful boys… please 🙏🏻 ❤😂
Those cinnamon rolls looked ah-mazing!!
Yeah I don’t see ry and Shane staying together. To much arguing lately
They don’t need a bath every single night . A good whipe down with a cloth would suffice
Definitely need more cooking/baking content from Shane 🤣
Jetson’s sweet face got me in my Mommy heart.
I wish my mental health wasn't so debilitating. I want a family that is full of love and my partner would make such a phenomenal parent. I don't know if it be fair for the child if im not mentally emotionally there enough for them a child deserves love not a emotionaly turbulent environment. My dad ended his life i was 6 and it broke me and life just breaks me more and more as ive grown. Still hurts now. I just wanna feel there hard moments and there best and the pride id feel watch them grow up and do the best they can
I love your vlogs and you both as dads!!!!!
I really respect that you’re not showing the little babies faces constantly and I believe they will appreciate it when they’re older 😌
This little family is so cute. The babies are adorable.  And ryland and Shane as parents beautiful to see.
This video totally made my St. Patty’s Day! 🍀
💕 Precious family 💕
Shane's cinnamon bites would've been good if he left the cream cheese separate and used it as a dipping sauce instead!
30:39 is giving RPDR, "it's chocolate" vibes 😂😂😂 also seeing Max and Jet brought tears to my eyes, I am so happy for the two of you and it makes my heart melt seeing your beautiful family and the love between you and Shane. I've been watching Shane since 2005 when I was in elementary school and now I'm 26 years old and am so happy to have been able to see and be on this journey with you both, congratulations and I wish you and your families and loved ones so many good things🥰!
I can't believe they are over 3 months old already! How time flies!!!!
I’m not sure if this is asking for too much but it would be amazing if you did a weekly or bi-weekly twin video aside from your normal videos. They wouldn’t even have to be hard core edited but wanting your baby’s is so healing for me. I have a baby sister on my dads side of the family that I barely know (I didn’t meet him until I was 16, I’m 21 now) but I seen her every day for a year and then my dads wife didn’t want me around anymore but point is watching them helps my mind some how. I used to watch another Chanel but she did some messed up shit and now I have no outlet😭 idk if any of that made sense
32:11 & 32:30🤣🤣🤣
You guys air good dads
How are they already 3 months!! Time slow down🥹
omg this video actually made me cry i am so grateful to ryland, he is such a responsible parent and shane is such a great planner for the babies, it is the absolute sweetest
? a dollop ? 🤣🤣🤣
OMG!!! The babies are so cute!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Omg🥰they are adorable! Takes me back to when my two teenagers were babies! Yall are doing an amazing job! And Shane.. those cinnamon "bites" looked so yummy I wanted to go right now at 11:30 at night and get the ingredients to make them! I'm so proud of both of you! ❤
I think you should try that cinnamon Hawaiian roll recipe all together in the glass tray! 😁
You guys are doing amazing and Ryland was MADE to be a dad!!!! ❤
25:12 BRO YOUR HUBBY DONT GET IT TWISTED !!!!!!!!!!
Ryland is the best mommy! thank you for sharing peeks of your beautiful baby boys, I'm missing having mine as babies😢
The boys are adorable 🥰😍😘
I'm a mom..and a twin... just his say this is the best video yall have ever uploaded! I just have so much love for yall!! Now I gotta go make Hawaiian  cinnamon rolls.❤
I can't believe they both have burnt cinnamon rolls on this channel 😂
honestly a dessert shop called mentally crumbling with anxiety and depression as the menu is GENIUS
B.t.w 20:31 BEST HAIR YOUVE HAD
Omgg instant baby fever!! I have 13 month old twin boys and you just made me want more, soooo cuuuuttttee
19:24 lol❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ lil ORK HAHAHHAHAHA
Shane had me laughing so hard while cooking and then Ryland had me crying with his sweet words about the boys, so many emotions in this episode 😂❤
cutest little babies, so happy to see you two in your element
Awesome video. The boys are adorable 😍.
Use Pillsbury pizza dough for cinnamon rolls, its super easy!
Shane, how could you with the Stanley slurps!? Mysophonia merch
Shane did an amazing job at the cinnamon roll bites!! 😍 Also, the babies are just adorable! 💕
I bet the issue with the cinnamon roll was using the muffin pan. All the surface area touching the pan all the way around is what I think burnt it. Update: So glad Ryland liked it! Shane bouncing around with happiness about that was great.
This vlog made me smile so big :’) I love seeing you all so happy and the boys are the CUTEST EVER❤
Your baby's are so cute!😊
i need more shane cooking!!
Watching Rylands moment with the babies and just being so grateful for his boys made me so emotional. So relatable how I feel about my new almost 3 month old.🥹😭
PLEASE bring back your cooking videos 🤔 those are my fave
First off you all are doing such amazing jobs as dads! They are absolutely precious 🥰 Second off I loved watching Shane cook because it brought back old memories of him doing the hilarious iconic food videos 💗
The zucchini boat sounds amazing and ez! especially with new babies around something fast and healthy sounding would be amazing for you two
A bloop, a dump, a dallop 🤣 I love those words as measurements.
I really love how you go about keeping us up to date with the babies. It was such a nice surprise to see such cute faces too! I definitely understand wanting to keep their faces more private. I’m the same way with my boys. 🩵
Omg this vlog was so much fun. I loved it ❤😊
it’s so refreshing seeing someone i used to watch as a kid have twins 😭 i gave birth to my twin boys in september and god it is nice to be able to relate and watch someone else going through what my significant other and i are going through! fun and hardships! congratulations and you’re both doing amazing!! ❤
Shane getting that Ozempic body 👀
The back of his shirt looks like it reads "BURN Admiral" right after he tasted the dessert and said "It's burnt." :D
LOVE LOVE LOVE BABY CONTENT
i love not revolving entire videos around showing the babies but doing a bit here and there is what i see a lot of people doing lately
I loved this vlog! ❤Ryland getting the boys bathed and Shane cooking? Y’all are so cute! And doing great
i seen that sweetest baby face and i literally teared up
Ryland I know how you feel! Plus you got double duty honey you and Shane are killing it! My youngest daughter needs her walk or her bath she’s 6 months. Slay girl
Model babies!!! They are so handsome OMG!!! Love you both, I'm so happy Jet & Max have you two for there Daddies!!! ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
I looooooved this vlog!!!! more more more! xo
This is amazing. Love watching you two be dads. The boys are precious. 🤍
So happy you guys are following a schedule, you will thank yourselves massively ❤️
Their little cries, milk gasps and faces are so cute. They are adorable
This babies are cute cute cute
Absolutely adorable 🥹💚
Move the cinnamon rolls up a rack on the stove or turn temp down by 5 or 10 degrees
MISSED opportunity to not use the crumbl cutter on the Hawaiian rolls.
I give my child a bath every other day bc he has eczema & bathing him everyday makes it worse!! Are Jett & Max good on the skin conditions?!😂😂 cuz I didn’t do anything crazy to GIVE him eczema but he sure did end up with it🥺😭🙄
Literally the only vlogs I love to watch! The boys are getting so big!
On insta they have a tutorial for some pizza bites with Hawaiian rolls. So good!
This vlog made my heart explode 🩷 The babies are so precious I cant believe they are 3 months already 🥹  The end of the video was so cute  Shane knows you so well  I love love loved this video  Shanes confidence while baking was EVERYTHING 🎉✨️
Fellow twin parent- youre doing the right thing sticking to schedule! Twin parents just cant go with the flow like a single baby, you are exactly right. Mine are two and sleep like champs and in sync bc of my neurotic schedule!!
Y’all should start playing tv shows in English and same thing in another language make them bilingual
Oh my freaking gosh they are ADORABLE!! I know you guys don’t want to show the boys but I live for those moments! 🤍🤍🤍
Omg those zucchini boats! Please make them! I’ve had that same exact recipe saved to my Pinterest and I never got around to trying them! 😂😂😂   Ps love you all! 🥰🫶
I love that our babies are going through the same milestones together! My baby girl just started babbling back to me too. I did sleep training with my first two and swore that’s why they slept through the night. I haven’t done it with my 3 month old and she is already sleeping through the night! We just got lucky!
The way that stove is so beautifully, never been used,  CLEAN!
Love the baby vlogs!!! You guys are doing a great job!!! ❤
I was not prepared to see jets face during the bath😱 he is sooo adorable
I love allll the baby content but I am LIVINGGGGGG FOR THE COOKING CONTENT! Love you both!
I love you both but I’m worried about ryland saying they are feeding goats milk because they didn’t tolerate dairy? Both are very unsafe for 3 month olds
Please…. Absolutely no disrespect whatsoever because I love Shane so very much but those sunglasses make him look like Evan Peters when he played Jeffrey Dahmer
I dont wanna ask for more daddy content because i know other viewers may want the regular but i could watch you blur out your babies all day !
Shane 😂 scoop the powder out next time.
Shane can you do a cooking channel too?
The babies are adorable, love you guys as parents. The burnt cinnamon bites... 😂😂  so funny
Please google giving your babies baths every night! It's not good for their baby skin!!
Your doing amazing 🤩
I want that bear suit!!!!
I feel like Shane could be a really good cook idk I just see it in him. Like my two brothers cook way better than me, I cook too it’s just idk why they are just better. I feel like Shane has the potential. I’m excited for chef Shane vids.
Shane when you cook dark, grey and even glass container 25 degree farenheit less than recipe. That's why it was burned at the bottom.
I'm so going to steal ALL of them cinnamon roll ideas from the hawaiian rolls to the maple syrup in the powdered sugar. And the boys are getting so big and SO dang cute! Also thanks for being one of the parents throwing a camera in their faces. Let their privacy stay pure and when they are old enough to decide let it be their wishes. Blessings!
i loved seeing your daily routine with the babies also we NEED to see Shane cook you a full dinner!
Shaaaaaaannne, you should have just cooked the zucchini boats. lol
That stroller is so beautiful! I agree with you , schedule is key. Sleep regression would screw me up bc I got on my boys sleep / eat schedule too 😂
As a mom of a 4 month old, I really feel we are raising our babies together ❤❤
Aw they are so precious ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I've been making Chizza at home for years... just put pizza toppings on top of tyson chicken patties. i cook them 10 mins in oven before adding toppings then put it in for 15-20 mins longer at 400F. SO DANG GOOD.
I’m grateful we got to see those cute little faces! Just precious! You guys are doing so well! Such great daddies! ❤️
Do twins wake each other up alot or do they sleep at the same time?
We were wondering where the cribs were going 😂😂😂😂
Why did I tear up when I saw the baby's face! So adorable
YES COOKING CHANNEL 🍳 slash just cooking as a hobby in general is so fun! Exactly what you did, is so fun: guesstimating, tasting, adding, learning from mistakes, trying new additions.... It's such a surprisingly creative hobby!
Shane is looking snatched!!!!
I'm so tired I was going to go to sleep but I couldn't stop watching. You guys are such great dads and they are Beyond precious❤❤😊
your telling me it’s been 3 months i’m going crazy
Jet looks so much like Shane! I’m in love 🥰🥰🥰 you’re doing a great job dada’s 🫶🏼🫶🏼
Omg they are so beautiful and perfect!
Omg that face in the tub;) Shane saying booby flay is beating off. Omg. 😂
Im fasting because its ramadan but still watching Ryland flog❤😭
THE SHOUTOUT TO GLOZELL 😂😂😂😂😂 OH MY GODDDDDDDDDD 😂😂😂😂 i used to show that video to everyone I ever met 😂 so fucking funny
Schedules really are important. I never realized that until later on when I see other parents struggling.
I love watching you with the babies! ❤
Oh loved the video and loved seeing the babies so so cute 🥰 and ryland ur so amazing with the babies and as a partner. Shane u make me laugh u are so adorable also! Beautiful family . But yes shane go get some cooking classes or hire a cook to come teach u both as a cute date thing u do
When you showed Jet in the bath I immediately melted! This time in your guys’ life is so precious. Enjoy it!!!
The bonds you two have with your boys is so lovely.
Ryland is such a natural parent!
1.) They are the cutest bbabies in the whole world, and that's saying something because I have kiddos and Grandkids. 2.) Meeting you two is on my bucket list.
Omfg, I’m crying laughing at Shane’s cinnamon roll segment 💀💀💀
I love that you let us sneak a little peak at the babies! I totally understand why you don't show them online, but my heart is so happy to get to see their adorable, perfect, sweet little faces after watching you and Shane go through this incredible parenting journey ❤

I do some cooking over on my channel people like cooking They like to watch cooking And they also like to know how good or bad it is
I cant stress enough how GOOD you guys are doing as parents. They are so cute and healthy and happy.
These vlogs make my life so much more enjoyable!!❤

Oh my gosh seeing you guys as dads melts my heart! I am so happy for you guys! Those baby’s are so loved!!!    And ofc super cute!! 🖤
Ryland, your hair looks amazing and Shane, I’ve missed your cooking and/or kitchen creation videos and really enjoyed this one and yes, your hair looks amazing too. 😘😘
Shane, learning to cook could be a great creative outlet for you and it could improve your relationship with food. I approve! Ryland you are doing a great job as a Mom- above and beyond!
Shane takeover was so fun haha
We struggle so hard taking my ASD daughter to Disney cause of how off the routine gets thrown. We still have fun but it’s definitely a struggle. I completely understand not wanting to offset that routine. It will pay off in the long run 💖💖💖
Love this!
Love Hawaiian rolls so much so that sounds so good Shane!!!
You guys are such amazing dads!! The routine is super important, I applaud you for sticking to it because it’s so easy to fall off track sometimes! I absolutely LOVE seeing you both parent, it warms my whole heart. Also I always die a little when I see the babies full on because they are literally SOOOO cuuuute!!! I love love love seeing your mum & dad era, this is my fav content ever. Would love to see more of the babies tho not gonna lie lol. ❤
I love Shane sm haha
You guys should try little sleepies pajamas if you like that crib sheet (they also have blankets and crib sheets) I got one and now I’m sucked into the world of buy sell trade bamboo 💀
The stars are so cute!!!
Omg when we got the face shot!!! Uhhh what a beautiful boy! I’m crying tears of joy!!
The cut up hotdogs and Mac n cheese was a staple at my house too haha, so good thought lol
Momma Ryland is putting in work on those cribs!!!!!

My heart just MELTED when we got the close up of Jets tiny feet started kicking away!!! OMGOODNESS!!!
Aww the babies ❤❤❤❤
❤🎉🍼👶🍼👶 I have to say I'm so glad you do not show the baby's faces. But what I did say of one he is adorable God bless them.💙💙
The intro
I loved seeing their cute little faces but I totally understand wanting to limit that as they grow up. I respect that decision fully. 😊
Love your videos Ryland and am always excited when you post! This video was the best cause we got to see your beautiful babies and we got to watch Shane cook! Such a fun video! Thanx! ✌🏻❤️😃 You are both great parents!!!
You are giving them the most incredible core memories. You’re doing good dads! Way to be good parents.
Cow milk and goat milk?
I need more of this ❤️
Why are you giving 3 month olds cow and goat milk?????? Breast or formular only. WHY!!! This is not OK.
They are literally the cutest babies ever OMG I love them!!! Also yall are amazing dads and Shane is a great cook!
Babies shouldn't have a bath everyday, that's terrible for their skin. You're going to dry out their skin and remove the good oils and such that are meant to be on their skin.
Love watching u guys being parents,you guys are doing great amazing really ❤❤
I’ve been watching both of you guys since before you got together you guys grew so much❤️ and You guys are such good parents already🥺🥺I’m so proud of you☺️
so you made.... monkey bread lol
I love these videos so much!!! I would love to see more of these!!!❤️
I wish my baby was as good with a schedule and going to bed! The only schedule he keeps to is feeding, and he is an absolute night owl like his dad!!! My baby’s bedtime is midnight 🥲
It’s Gordon Ramsey, I’m shook lmao 😂 ❤ and the boyyyyssss omgggg so cute! You two are hella cute
Love your videos!
so basically you order food 3x/day every single day?
Thank you for letting us see the baby’s!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Omg the podcast set up… it’s giving me anxiety 🤣😂
That was not cooking, that was basting store bought bread 😭
Aw, you guys are good dad's. They're too cute! & so are their little outfits!!
Currently still laughing my ass off about Shane gagging after drinking the ginger drink 🤣
Ew no Shane do the zucchini one
SHANE, please do more cooking videos!   That was so good!   Jet is so cute, I could cry 😢
That baby looks like Shane👀
Shane: literally makes cream cheese frosting Also Shane: "OMG did I just do something completely novel and exciting?!"
Shane honey. Nexttime clean off the muffin tins because that will burn and smell funny. U did great
Shane and Ryland in their daddy era is sooo beautiful 🥰
Next time add thin apple slices to the butter glaze 😋
Ryland you are SUCH a mom ❤ its the cutest thing ever, the boys are very lucky.  Shane is ok too 😂 ❤❤
3 months already 😮
I Love how Ryland interacts with the babies 🩷🩷 he is a real mom(dad)
My favourite blog of all time. Would happily watch this content daily ❤❤❤
I think thats so funny how one twin is goat milk and the other is cow milk....me and my twin sister were the same. I had cow milk and my sister had soy milk! #fedisbest
It’s Ryland being, the MOM & DAD, at the same time!! 😂  Love the Winnie The Pooh outfits as well, Shane. The silly ol bear is my BFF too. 💛♥️
my heart is so full!! the cutest babies ever omg 🥺🥺🩷 I’m a daycare teacher and when I first started in the baby room I had to follow their little routine their parents set I think it really helped them. now the babies are one years old and they’re the cutest !! I’m loving the mom era for Ryland it’s so cute and interesting to see ❤😊
Omgosh they are absolutely adorable!!! 🩵💙🩵💙🩵💙🩵
A new podcast episode AND a new  Ryland vlog, I sure know what I’m going to be doing today!
I’m so happy your showing the babies they the cutest babies 🥺🥺
They are so beautiful!! You guys seem like very good parents.
Recipes aren't cheating. I use them all the time. Save favorites in a folder. I have ingredients delivered too or order online and pick up at store.
shane ur cinnamon bites looked UNBELIEVABLE!! u can absolutely do it again n do 5 mins each side and then check / flip them every 2 mins but literally other than that you’ve got that down
Getting to see your vlog & Shane’s pod in one day has been the highlight of my afternoon 💞 As for y’all not showing the boys.. I really like the way you’ve gone about it & if you decide to show them from time to time so you have it “to look back on” & people don’t get that & also just can’t appreciate it then they don’t need to be here 🤷🏻‍♀️ 🩵  I genuinely got teary eyed when you were giving Jet his bath & we got a quick peek of his sweet face..omg soo cute 🥹 Yall are doing great..the boys are blessed to have you as their Daddies!🫶🏻
SCHEDULES! This is something I don't understand about my family and my family doesn't understand about me. When my littlest was less than a year old, as much as 15 minutes off schedule could have us messed up for a week. Parenting is hard enough, why would I go out of my way to make it harder? I basically followed Huckleberrys schedules but my daughter was always a month or so ahead of her peers in sleep needs. Her schedule hasn't changed since the 2 to 1 nap transition at 12 months. She's 2.5 now and naps 1-2pm.
I was the same with my daughter and didn't like disrupting her routine. I will say I wish I would have gone on more adventures with her as a baby. It's adorable seeing their reactions to things. Mt daughter loves seeing all her baby videos and pictures. We did start taking her out more once she started solid foods.
I can’t get over how big they are and seeing you two as dads I don’t know why but I just sobbed ! Like actual tears xo i love you both xo ❤
❤❤❤
Shane why couldn't you just cook Ryland dinner?
I actually loved seeing the BTS of the podcast. Massive amounts of cameras and chords.
The babies are so cute!!!
Thanks so much for sharing, they’re so precious! Love you boys! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
I love that our babies are a week apart! My daughter was born on 12/14😭🥹💜
I feel like your oven runs hots because everything you guys make gets burnt
OMG JARED IS THE SPITTING IMAGE OF THE KEITH LEMON BEAR FROM BO SELECTA 😂😂😂😂😂
I could watch those baby feet all day ❤
OMG, Max & Jet are so frickin ADORABLE!!! They've grown so much Ryland😍😍 I 100% support & respect your decision to keep them off the internet for the most part. Need to protect your beautiful boys❤
Loved this vlog !!! Shane NEEDS to continue to do cooking vids on this channel
You guys mentioned wanting to cook more once the boys are old enough to eat. I’d LOVE to see little vlog-style cooking videos!!
❤😂 But I asked you if I should make food for me and Danny but I'm already making food
I totally understand not wanting to show the babies on camera, but I nearly yelled when you showed Jet. He is SO. FREAKING. CUTE!! Everytime they were in the background of the video I was like “AWW I SEE A BABYYYY!!” 😭😍❤️
If y’all need some cooking advice, let me know. I’m not a dietician or professional chef or anything but I’m a 50-something year old fat chick who adores you and Shane and I love cooking!
I actually think Shane would be a very good cook.
I DIED at Jetson in the bath 😭😭😭 sweetest baby face in the world!!!!
Y’all are doing a great job of making content about the babies but not over doing their privacy!
Cute babies! So sweet Shane cooking  ! Yall are so cute together!
I need cooking with Shane more! 😂😂
This vlog instantly made me cry watching you guys being parents and seeing how far you guys came from 😭🥰🥰 I'm so happy for you guys, and your babies are so lucky to have you guys as parents ❤ you guys should do more family dinner ideas 😂 💕
Omggggg there soooo cuteee ❤
I have two toddlers, and you all are making me want another 🥹
These babies are too cute
I def wouldn’t be using soap every bath time, maybe every other! Don’t want them to get dry skin!
Omg I love seeing a peek of them!! They are so adorable!!!!!!!!!!
I love sandy she is a total vibe i love her energy it makes me feel happy and safe 🤗
Shane has proven he can’t cook 🤣🤣
It's literally chicken parm with pepperoni 😊
I cried when I seen his sweet little face😍😍 I completely understand not showing them!! So thank you for letting us just see how precious they are😍 I love how strict you are with there schedule!! Life is so much easier with a schedule!! I have a 13 and a 12 year old and we still have a daily schedule😍😍
Ohhhh myyyy! Beautifullll Baby Boys!😍🥹
This was the best video! I so needed this tonight. I love your family and you guys to pieces ❤ like cinnamon roll pieces Shane!
I was 3 lbs when I was born and all I could drink was goat milk
As a professional chef I'm just cackling watching Shane cook. Btw needing to desperately pee but ignoring it to cook is standard for a chef. 😂
LOL I love it when fast food addicts act as if they are critiquing Haute Cuisine!
I had twins and routine and schedules help extremely! It does get easier when they get older but you two are being awesome first time dads!
I would definitely like to see zucchini boats - please show
I would watch Bake with Shane!
You guys are family goals 🥰 The channel's growth is so organic. I absolutely love when I get a notification from any of y'all's channels. It's a much needed jovial escape from reality. Thanks for letting us come along with this new journey into parenthood with you.
We love to see a Glozell shoutout.
I enjoyed getting to see their face they are definitely cute. I kind of like how they are doing. It showing their face every so often since they vlog the whole journey on having them
Shane the “special thing” when you’re baking is called vanilla extract xoxo
Shane is so unbearable. Does he act like that as a skit and to be funny or is he really that way ? Ryland is great tho 😜
Ry, will you be my dad?😂❤
The baby in the tub was so cute oh my goodness you had to get his tooth wash😂❤❤❤❤
fifteen minutes, stop over thinking and bang, you got your creation, but that's the thing with cooking, it's a process, I'm not worried. The maple syrup, total genius.
Honestly 20 mins seemed a bit toooooo much……
Omg yall are the CUTEST!!!
Keeping my boys on a schedule saved my life😮‍💨
OMG they’re so cute!! 🥹
So glad u guys are parents!! It’s fun to watch all of you grow together!!! So blessed!! What little sweeties!!! Love u all!
You are doing a great job Ryland! Great daddies!
Ryland I love how organized you are. I was never that good. Seeing the babies melts my heart. They are so cute.  I loved seeing Shane in the kitchen. It’s been a long time.  You two are the best dads.
The babies are so cute. What do your furbabies think about the babies? And how do Jet and Max react to them. Have a good night.
This is so cute ❤
Bottle feeding: something that I researched was “pace bottle feeding” meaning not to hold the bottle directly straight up. It would be having the baby sit up and the bottle lowered more so that way you’d avoid colick or baby taking milk too fast at a time!
shane is in his nara smith era
❤❤❤❤
the babies are such a good addition to the vlogs. like  period
not me running to get a cinnamon roll when this video was over 😋
OMG I LOVE COOKING/BAKING WITH SHANE
Omfgg why did jerid look like keith lemon in bow selecta to a fucking T!!!! Look it up UK program it’s the  bear skit 😂😂😂😂 fml
@Grannysoffherrocker made it in the KFC commercial and on the vlog! LOVE IT!❤
Omg seeing their little faces all grown up!! So stinkin’ cute!! And you’re doing a fabulous job!
My face just lid up when I saw their faces, they are so cute!!!! 🥰
these sound effects throughout the video have me cracking up. 😂
omg so cuteeeeeee
Thanks for shring a day with us! Those boys are gorgeous! Loved the chubby legs kicking ❤  You're both doing a fab job. Shane, your cinnamon bites had my mouth watering! ❤❤❤❤
cutest babies !!!
those big baby eyes❤️❤️
I had my twins cribs like that ❤ They would stand up and dance with each other once they got a bit older 😂 ❤
Babies are ADORABLE !❤❤
Did yall not know the whole more sleep for babies, leads to more sleep? When parents are freaking out about the babies not sleeping through the night. It’s cause they aren’t getting enough during the day
The ONLY Family vlog I will EVER watch <3 Shane and Ryland are such good dads!! <3
I just love you both! Thank you for sharing just a glimpse of your precious baby boys. And cuddois to you for trying to keep them on a schedule, which is so imperative for them. And love how y'all still keep it real lol
I’m sorry but these babies are just so beautiful I loved watching this video the most 🥰🥰
Ryland is the absolute mom dad!❤❤❤
I flipping love how adorable Shane is over their boy’s outfits❤❤❤
shane should make a cooking video with Lizze!!
Shane needs to make a cooking video with Lizze!!
Firstly jet in the bath SO CUTE. secondly, when Shane bit into that roll and was like Omg it’s burnt I criiiied laughing. Soooo funny! Still looked amazing in the end though!! X
OMG idk which one you showed but he was PRECIOUS!! Model baby in the making!!! I literally got tears in my eyes. I know you don't want to show them and I COMPLETELY respect that but DAMN THEY'RE CUTE!!!!
I see you happy and well organized with your beautiful babies.❤❤
More cooking with Shane !! Omg the babies are amazing . Great vlog guys .
I’m just a regular person and I showed my son as an infant but stopped at around 18 months. I always obscure his fast if I post him or only the back of his head. Once he became recognizable I stopped posting him. It should be his choice if he wants to be online forever when he’s older. Also a guy tried to. Pick me up once using my son, that was the end of f instagram posting.
So bloody cute! The babies are everything and I’m glad you’re not overshowing them. It’s such a suprise to see their faces every now and then to see how they have changed !
I love these videos. I think your showing the appropriate amount of baby and still being Ryland and Shane vlogging. Don't listen to the haters. This is new you guys are finding your lane. I think it's so beautiful your life and you guys are amazing daddy's !!!!! Your doing everything right ❤❤  Do the cribs change more ? I would change it to the lowest setting. I understand the size of the crib cuz they are new borns but before you know it you will need a deeper size crib. One day they will just stand up , it's kinda shallow. You could wake up one day and they will be standing. ! That's my only advice. Your doing amazing 🤩 loves it new daddy's.. this is so exciting! Yes Shane cooking . Daddy Shane
Aww I love when we get a peek of our nephews! 🥰❤️ they’re growing so fast!
I can’t deal with how cute ohmy 🥹🥹
It’s hard for my attachment issues when Shane has a new shirt.
I want to see more of Shane Cooks  :)  Pro tip for sticky buns, you put brown sugar, a sprinkle of cinnamon and a small pat of butter in the bottom of the muffin tin,  Put your bun on top, then do the rest of your soak.  The bottom will be gooey and sticky and so yum.  But, 20 min is too long.   This was the perfect amount of babies - they don't have to perform for the camera, they are just part of your lives so it doesn't feel like exploiting them.  I love that you are both very aware of not wanting to over expose them.  Having said this, I would join a Patrion that posted 4 pics of those babies a week because my heart just melted when we saw the cute little face - take my monies, show me the babies  🤣🤣😂
Pmsl...... please search Keith Lemon bear..... totally jerids outfit 😂😂😂
The scream I SCRUMPT when I saw you and Shane posted omfg
Just fyi, goats milk is not safe for infants. It may be gentler, but check with your pediatrician as I’m sure you have.
You should both take cooking classes!!
Shane, if you are reading this, PLEASE make a shirt that says, " I was thinking with this fucking noggin," and add it to your merch! I feel like it would sell the f out immediately  -love a devoted fan <3
That shot of Jet was the cutest thing I’ve ever seen!!! What a sweet boy 🥹
Thanks Shane for the lol time! The babies are beautiful 💜 Blessings 💜
I really enjoyed seeing Shane like that in the whole cooking bit🫶🏼 you’re doing amazing keep on going 🫶🏼🫶🏼
i love winnie the pooh baby clothes there so big and they will definitely be more chatty
My nephew who is now 5 had a allergic reaction to regular baby formula when he was a baby. He had to drink soy based baby formula. We had him on a schedule too.
Yesss! Routine and structure daddy’s your doing awesome it’s essential without it? Chaos lol
Handsome little Jet in the bathtub was to cute🥹😍! Also btw why is it so funny to watch Shane cook?😂👨🏻‍🍳👌🏼
Are you going to put masks on them like Michael Jackson’. It’s insane to be this paranoid.
Ryland your glowingggggg🥹
What a lil fam jam!!!!!!! 💞💞💞💞💞💞
You saved the day!🎉🎉🎉
You guys are such great parents like it comes so naturally to you guys these boys are full of love ugh 😩🫶
Sorry it burned :-(
YUMMY SHANE!!!
You guys 😂 I can’t with Shane 😂 And the boys oh my heart ❤ thanks for sharing with us such amazing work you guys are doing healthy happy babies !!!
❤
Shane making food cheered up my whole weekend!
Omg his so adorable thank you for sharing him with us believe there more good people on here then bad especially us moms 🥰
Can I give you guys a tip? You need to be rotating the babies when they sleep, that’s why their head look more flat in the back less then round, put the babies to sleep on their sides and switch back and forth between sides for at least a month, my baby boy born on November 28th does not sleep any other way then on his side or belly and it helps him so much with gas, not saying you have to listen but something I’ve learned being a mama of 2 ❤❤ much love you guys I’m so proud of you for keeping your words and not sharing the babies faces all the time (had to edit that because I didn’t see bathtime yet)
Tell me your in a two Dad household WITHOUT telling me your in a two Dad household, The toliet seat ALWAYS stays up ❤
I love this for you both. Doing such a good job. Round of applause for both Shane and Ryland. Awh I seen little shane 😭🤍
I thought babies had to be one before they had cows milk?
Shane have you ever thought about shaving your hair off like you did before?
I love the dad vlogs please don’t ever think we don’t enjoy this. Seeing you guys as dads is the best thing ever and it makes my heart so full. The vlogs are wholesome and funny. I love that you guys are keeping the babies privacy. ❤❤❤
Another great video and fyi granny off her rocker is the lady in that commercial she’s got a you tube channel she’s hilarious 😂 PS I wish my oven was as clean as yours 🤷‍♀️
I LOVE seeing you two as parents❤❤
I have that square white plate! I love and use it a lot!
I was going to say the same thing she did it's like chicken parmesan with some pepperoni on top
Imagine saying made from scratch but using a premade roll. Shane 😜 ! Love your content tho! 💕✨
Omg, I was hoping you would show them, even if it's if it was just for a minute. I understand yall not wanting to show too much,  but I hope we see them  here and there as they're growing.  Love your beautiful family!!🩵🩵🩵
You had me dying 🤣 the porn music when you were about to take a bite, then the somber rain when it was burned 🤣🤣
It's Gordon Ramsay! He's shook!!!!
Why can’t you show the babies pictures? Who cares.
Rylan is a good dad. He loves his boys
What baby monitor do you guys have?  I am having a baby in late April, and have no IDEA what monitor to get!
Shane!   I had just took my dose of cannabis for my lower back pain and when I seen your look when you bit into your rolls! priceless! 😹😀😄😁🤢🤮😆🤣😂I hope that is glazed 🤪😜😛😋on the bottom! You were so happy hoping it was crusted ! 💩💩☠☢🚫🚫🛑🛑🛑🛑 The Universe sent you a message on your next Journey Shane! Cooking Podcast! Good luck! 💝💋
❤❤❤❤
You did great Shane ! Lol just move your oven rack up and every oven is different higher or lower than exactly what recipe calls for etc  if you know ur oven and try some easy stuff you can tell how your temperature runs and racks help a lot too ❤❤❤❤
He said same 😂
Not you turning around to spit out the cinnamon roll and me thinking your the back of your shirt said “burn admiral” lolol
I dont want to focus on weight, but has Shane lost the baby weight already? :P He looks slimmer. Having babies I guess can stress you :P
I got so excited when shane brought up the recipie for the zucchini boats but was so upset when he didnt make them. Please make them for a video 💗
❤
I miss Shane’s cooking / food videos I wish we had more content of him just doing stuff lol
Shane help at all with babies?
I love the Colorado house but Calabasas in a beautiful neighbourhood
Oh my goodness!! They are so adorable!! Thank you for sharing them with us. What a sweet treat indeed 🥰
So is Jets biologically Ryland's son? And Max is Shane's?
I respect and appreciate your decision about your boys being too exposed online😍 so when we we do get a glimpse of their precious little faces it makes my heart so happy 😍😍❤️❤️
I look forward to Sundays BECAUSE of Rylands Vlog how could I not? Ryland's Vlog, Lizze's Vlog, The Sip and The Sdp are what make up my screen time. I am 1000% here for the Dad Era. Ryland you have always been gorgeous but I must say lately you are GLOWING and magnetic. Much love and support always.
4:02 I was about to say that's literally Chicken Parm without noodles lol
Mentally crumbling lol
It’s ok Shane to follow a recipe to cook family meals.  Start with simple recipes until you get comfortable cooking like using those hello fresh kits.  Also your oven may run too hot. Get an oven thermometer to see if it’s keeping accurate temperature.
The pants on the light in the nursery 😂
I love how Shane went from cooking a whole dinner from scratch to heating up rolls for dessert.😂
Shane showing the outfits is giving "Bee beez, why are there so many gates??? Bee beez..." 😭
Thank you for Atleast sharing a glimpse of the babies! I’m so happy for you guys still! I can’t wait to see the babies grow up with you guys! Ryland you are such a sweet dad! Keep posting content like this please!!
Oh they are so cute 🥺🥰
I love the recipes of Sanctuary Kitchen on Youtube, easy, step by step, can't go wrong...try it
If you are having a racing heart at night, time for a check up! Don’t just blow it off, catching it early could be important!
It was the excitement then disappointment for the cinnamon rolls that had me wheeze 😂😂😂😂
25:57 I was so moved by you Ryland sharing this moment with all of us! I have a special place in my heart for you and your family! 💋
They’ve gotten so big already 😢❤😊
Ryland i just wanna say that it puts a smile on my face seeing u n shane with the twins. U guys are such great dads!! 💙
5:04 that was the cutest fucking noise ever.
Shaneeee!
Thank you thank you thank you thank you on n on n on the boys are adorable omggggggg
shane being to overwhelmed to make food.... hey bud we get it.... but the whole fam needs to eat. time to just try and if you mess up who cares... THEN postmate!.... i have tried new stuff so many times that have turned into a flop but you eventually learn..... no one is just automatically good at everything. an i am not over here making top shelf meals... sometimes its throw a couple peices of meat on the grill and potatoes and whatever else its not hard... if you mess it up what is the worst that can actually happen?
I love the way you are handling the boys online.   You are allowing us to love the,, but not expose them.   Love it.
I think it’s great you guys don’t show your boys on the internet. Social media is full of creeps. You are doing great❤
The fact that Shane was able to anticipate literally every single thing you said after trying the dessert just shows how well you really know and love eachother! 🥹❤️
23:24
Not judging but the back of the heads go flat in on backs to much.just keep that in mind.
DID SHANE LOST WEIGHT? LOOKS GOOD
I love you boys!!
Shane .. the rolls are already cooked right ? So just heat them.. not cook.. forgive me if I am wrong 😑
🤚🤚Hawaiian Rolls Babby 🤚🤚All the way! Shane! Love ya all! stay safe!
Really got that face reveal lol I knew it wouldn't last long 😅
You have to put creamers in when cooking them lol
Toodles!* lol <3
I think showing the babies 1 time a month. Let's us see who they.look like.
Why has it not sunk in that you guys are literal fathers😭 every time you show them I’m like awww they’re such good Guncles🤍 congratulations such a beautiful thing for you guys!
So, you're not cooking anything?😂😂😂
They are adorable❤!! You two are such great Dad's.
I’m so glad we got glimpses awww beautiful babies
As an owner of 4 Great Danes in my life I am loving Shanes shirt.
When I saw his lil face I yelled “Omg” so loud that my husband ran in here and asked “What’s wrong??” I said “Look how freakin cute this bebes face is !!!” He was like ..really ??! Haha  Soooooo cute ! Time flies. My baby boys are 18 and 13 😢
Shane’s energy in this video was so good I can’t explained it but he seemed so like calm or something idk lol ❤
Is there any chance of getting a new episode of fights with Shane and ryland?
🥰👍
oat milk????????????
In your defense Ryland, I WAS wondering about the crib placement. hahaha
I love how Ryland hypes up Shane’s half ass attempt at cooking hehehehe
Shane went from “i can cook” to assembling bread with sugar😂
Can we get a new vlog and podcast intro?
😍😍😭jetsonnnnnn omg
I Stan so hard for these people. I'm realizing I really didn't want to get caught up in a parasocial thing but God I look so forward to these vlogs and pods.
I always go back to the old days when y'all were goofy and had people in your lives who shall remain nameless but how much y'all have grown up and just have turned into these amazing dads and it always brings me to tears. I love seeing these videos
Ryland get a hair cut and shave. Ya look like a bum. Leave that to Shane 😅
Baby Jet and Max are soOoOoOo adorable 🥰. You’re doing such a good job with not showing their faces and it’s so sweet how mindful you are with their schedules ❤. When you were reflecting on the past year was so cute the love in your eyes was my favorite part of the vlog.
I jus cried when I seen jet in the tub he is so cute and they are so precious I’m so happy and proud of u two ❤
Okay but can you please tell me where you got that baby crib mobile? DROP THE LINKKK pls 🥺
Happy St. Patrick’s Day! I have a ton of delicious recipes for the holiday if you’re feeling Lucky! 🤪💚☘️💚 Love your videos! Y’all seem to be killin this parenting journey so far! Keep loving all the loves!
My boy is almost 4 months old it's wild how fast they grow. Also the mid bottle chats are always the best
Okay I have to say, their names fit them so well. They could not be any cuter! Absolutely precious
10:36 omg! Just adorable!  Here's a 🍭 lollipop from cousin Jerry! 💋
yall should start making more cooking videos this one was so entertaining 🤣🤣 I couldn’t stop laughing. Start a vlog series of learning how to cook by just trying a lot of new recipes!
Omg! They are so cute! 🥹❤❤
[Oh wow, what are you feeding those infants, er, Chunky Monkeys.!!? I really like how you have a beautiful Uno's portrait hanging in the nursery bathroom.]
I was excited for Shane to cook. He needs to redeem himself pls
❤ you guys
I sense a Rosanna Pansino Nerdy Nummies video in your future, Shane.
Thank god for rylands vlogs cuz then I get to see Shane every week ❤ I love u too ryland
Jet looks so much like Shane
Really take in the next couple months …. Months 3-5 is such a content and happy period for an infant generally until they hit the 5 month regression lol   I’m really proud of you guys for sticking with a schedule.  Doing that will give your babies a sense of security in knowing what to expect.    Cutest babies!! 👶🏻 🩵💙
😮❤❤❤❤ the boys are so adorable!!!
One of my girls favored one side and started to get a little flat. We had to help her practice stretching her neck muscles and sitting her in a way that the things she wanted to look at were the other way. It helped us, but like you said every kid is different. Don’t stress! You’re doing great.
i love love love this era of life!!! I’ll never get bored of baby content. I’ve been watching Shane since day one and i’m sooooo happy for them!!!
Who is gonna tell Shane that kings Hawaiian is not actually from Hawaii. They are based and made in California 😂
Them babies are so adorable!! 🥰 Shane you did so good. Ryland you love them boys so much you were almost crying. ❤
They are so cute !!!! ❤
I love watching you both with your babies. I’m in that era too with my son born on 12/11/23 so it’s extra exciting. My milk monster sleeps through the night and that’s my saving grace 😂. 30 ounces a day! Hungry baby. And now Lizzie is having a boy and it’s a boy gang and I’m excited ❤
PLEASE, more of these videos!!💗🌷
Ryland and Shane are inspiring more and more to think about being a father myself one day
the babies are already 3 months old I can not believe it time goes by so fast
Seeing you both be parents to your boys is so beautiful ❤
I got the tinsel sheets from pottery barn and they are the softest sheets ever I will absolutely love them
Your babies are so sticken cute!!❤
Awww burps lol I used to have use my hand from top of diaper on back and rub upwards and only way my son would burp lol
Omg sooooo cute I can’t handle it!!!
The boy's are getting so big!! How cute are they!! and Shane's dessert looks good! 😙
You should try monkey bread. 🫠❣️
I thought babies couldn't consume cows milk/goats milk because they can't break down the proteins and enzymes, and it causes intestinal bleeding? Was I misinformed?
You made my Sunday. ❤❤
Not avoiding their faces , but not SHOVING THEM IN THE CAMERA 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼 you’re doing great dads❤️❤️ that quick little glimpse made me feel like auntie😭💞
Oh my goodness. How adorable are they?!
Fricking hilarious...this was better than any sitcom I've ever seen. (Shane, next time try adding a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice to the icing 😘)
My kiddo will be a year old in a week and looking back at the 3 month stage makes me so emotional! My dad heart!!
Just a recommendation since you and Shane both burnt the bottoms of your cinnamon rolls it may be an issue with ur oven! Get an oven thermometer and stick it IN your oven, im a oretty dang good cook but for some reason ANYTIME i used my oven stuff would always come out burnt on the bottom, i got an oven thermometer and found out my oven is off by like 20-25° It made a HUGE difference and i no longer end up woth overcooked food and baked goods that are burnt on the bottom! P.s. you're an amazing Dad Ryland, i always knew you would be because of how you cared for all your animals, but its so sweet seeing you in action and gow davoted you are to the boys! They're lucky to have you, both of you!❤️
😂 Shane and Ryland are so cute, it’s amazing, I remember when Shane introduced Ryland, now they have a full family ❤ I’m so happy Shane is thriving because of Ryland, them meeting each other really did change their lives ❤❤
Not Shane saying hot dogs chopped up in macaroni and cheese when I’m currently eating hot dogs chopped up in macaroni and cheese
Ryland I need you to make a cooking video without hello fresh. Because those are cheating. Lol
omg ryland you are doing an amazing job with them!!!! and they are sooo adorable thank you for that shot of jet i literally screamed he so cute 🤧💛💛💛
19:16 omg he’s so cute I teared up.
Rylands hair is slaying
There is a bottle that is really cool to feed twins at the same time called Tinukim so you don’t have to juggle 2 bottles at once if just one person is feeding. Hope that helps
They are the cutest twins ❤
I would not feed cow milk. Me and my husband used to run a dairy farm and I can tell you right now. You don’t wanna know what is inside that milk. Not to mention all the sugar that’s in it.
I think Shane should cook more 😊 I think he is good at it ( which makes me surprised that he always Postamtes 😅😂)
what kind of stroller is this!! i need a double stroller before i’m due in sept ! anyone know?!
im SO nervous to have my baby in August and i know im not nearly as well off or stable financially as yall but it really makes me feel so comfy and so much better watching you guys become dads. Thank you for sharing seriously <3 and i respect you not wanting to show them but i agree with what someone else said, you show them just enough that we feel included but theyre not the center of the vlog. Love you guys <3
Leave everything behind, King Ryland posted 🎉
The boys are so adorable!! Shane you did a great job and the cinnabites. Ryland you got this. Enjoy the moments ❤❤
that face in the bath was genuinely the most precious thing in the whole world
As a mom of twins make sure they get tummy time as well to prevent flat head that is the hardest with two babies!  You guys are doing great ❤
Oh my gosh those cutie patootie chubby boys. They are just too cute ❤
The crying while describing the baby clothes was so cute hahaha cause the outfits r so damn cute 😭😭😭
Only in america does cinnamon buns come with glaze xD
Shane if you thought those were good you need to try the creme brulee donuts rolls made with those yummy rolls as well. YUMMMMM. Boys are getting so big! Cuteness overload for sure! So sweet to watch you both being such great dads.
Hahaha my misophonia went CRAZY at the end. Shane's face said it all for me lol
Yes!!  Schedule is key!! I truly believe that's what makes a really well behaved toddler.
Shane:  I have to say that your glaze is amazing!!!!!  You have VERY good instincts for flavors!   I never would have paired all of that but WOW!  ❤❤❤  The reason they got hard is because the hawaiian rolls are already cooked - so they can't be cooked for 20 minutes.
Goat milk is dairy, isn’t it? 😂
Well bless your heart fir getting twins on a schedule! Also, now I have to make Shane's cinnamon rolls! I LOVE Hawaiian rolls!WHAT BEAUTIFUL babies!❤
In the future Shane - shave the bottom off with a cheese grater!!
4month sleep regression coming up soon. Look up the “Wonder Weeks” calendar. Obviously every baby is different.
If only you knew how many moms are in the audience 😂🥰
Ok the cooking segment was hilarious. You should have a branch of every video be a cooking/baking part and then Ryland comes and taste tests.
Those cinnamon rolls ARE 🔥! Just look at the recipe on YouTube. And I've used maple syrup (sorry, Shane!) They are easy and amazing. 5 ⭐'s. And those babies are just divine. Good parents! 💕
😂❤
OMG THEYRE SO BEAUTIFUL!!! SO PRECIOUS ❤❤❤❤❤
Please continue to post baby stuff, I’ve been a Long time Shane fan and you have been a great addition to the Shane Lore. I’m on my 2nd child (two days apart from your boys) and I love seeing the products you use and what not. With my first one (who is now 2) it was a struggle to find things that worked and so many products/things wasted it’s nice to see these things! So happy that You guys aren’t letting negativity hold you back!
Ryland it’s called breakfast for dinner  we do that sometimes
19:14 so cute. OMG thanks Ryland. We alrady can see who he looks like :p the nose, the eyes eheh that's Shane eheh
❤❤❤
OMG THEY ARE SO BIG AND GENEROUS!!!! 💙🩵I AM IN LOVE!!!!!😻
We need a video on what baby items you absolutely need! ❤
You are perfekt Dads. I love to see you happy. Sending love from Germany 💕
Ryland is such a mom grown so much there adorable.
The way my heart dropped when you turned him over in the bath😭😭😭 he’s soooo cute omg
Omg! I was soo excited to see his face! Ugh my son is 2 now an I miss that infant age! It continues to get even better as they grow but then you miss that little bean of a baby! You guys are such great dads! Love these videos ♥️♥️
I must say those two boys are so VERY LUCKY to have such wonderful Dads that love them so much and take such wonderful care of them.  They are so sweet, and handsome but the best thing is that they are so chill, comfortable, and understand how much they are loved!!  ❤❤❤
Wait who is Spencer??? I’m lost!! 😂
It’s Gordon Ramsey he’s shook 😂😂 this is why I love Shane. Of course love Ryland as well! Happy to see you guys adjusting to dad life 💙
Wait until you’re first sleep regression 😭😂 But on the real note- your babies are so precious!
Happy Sunday Ryland and Shane! Thank you so much for uploading today. Life has been really tough for me lately and I just wanted to say thank you so much for always making me laugh until I can't breathe. It warms my heart so much watching you as fathers. You guys are doing a phenomenal job. Much love always and forever!
I see you doing most of the work with the babies Ryland, I'm just wondering does Shane put in the same amount of work when it comes to feeding and changing diapers and doing the stroller walks
they’re surprisingly quiet while you’re filming lol 🤣
It’s so crazy i remember when you guys first got together…. love this for yall!!!
Ryland describing the cinnamon roll is so funny and Shane’s reaction is so cute
So cute
Don't feed the baby while they're laying down that can cause ear infections
They are adorable! My son is 3 months older but looks so big already in comparison 🥹
all Capricorns have straight ears and huuuge smiles...its a thing. ♑
I know you didn't want to show their faces on videos...BUT OMG IM SO THANKFUL YOU DID!!! So freaking adorable!!!😍😍😍😍
I would cook for Ryland about twice - maybe three times.  He would whine about it, and then I'd postmate everything forever. Ryland be supportive of Shane!!!  If you are supportive he'll cook!  ❤❤❤
THE BOYS ARE TO CUTE! Growing so quick & your so great with the way ya’ll film them love you all xx
I love Ryland he’s the cutest
Omg! BBQ Chicken on Sweet Hawaiian rolls is SO good! You guys should try it
Next time put some butter in your glaze. Yum. The babies are so so cute
shane! it’s because you put the rolls on the bottom rack! if you put them in the middle rack, the bottoms won’t burn as fast🫶🏼also Jet is SO cute in the bath😭😭😍
As a lifelong born and raised resident of Hawaii, I officially am sponsoring this video on behalf of the Hawaiian rolls ❤😂🎉
Shane getting excited over the baby clothes is so precious lol. My boyfriend watched him way back in like 2009 lol so he’s like wow Shane’s really a dad now! We are both living for it. Also, those babies are so gorgeous 🖤 precious ones
These vlogs make my day. I’d watch every single day if we had a new vlog every day.
Is it ok to bathe a 3-month-old every single night? I thought 3-4 times per week...?
They are so adorable!!!!!
Please wash all clothes, linens, etc. before using them. Even "covers" that are covered by sheets or other additional covers. For naps & night sleeping there are blackout tents meant to train their bodies to recognize sleep time. But y'all want to stimulate them with twinkling "stars" instead if calming them to sleep thereby actually reducing their sleep time? The room is meant to be pitch dark. Btw, the only thing I was wandering about the cribs was why are the twins being separated? Also, freeze leftovers. Then only occasionally over the next 1-3 months ya got a surprise treat if for example a cinnamon roll....that could easily transfer into a french toast.
Why do we only get to see Jet & not Max? Just curious.. Maybe it wasn't intentional. Either way, love yall & so happy for yall!
Just wait till the need a nap and fight it. My son is bad but my daughter is heel bent on staying awake
Use brown sugar on the rolls and powdered sugar in the icing.
Although I'd love to see their sweet faces, I love that you are protecting their identity. ❤️
I’m loving this  version of them two especially Shane. It’s really showing his soft side and it’s so heart warming!
its 6:03 Rylanda coming out for me😂
Such wholesome and domesticated queens now ❤❤
You guys are doing such a wonderful job with the babies❤ What a beautiful family.
BABY LED WEANING IS LITERALLY BOILING VEGGIES.. YOU CAN BOTH DO IT ❤️
I feel like he’ll wife me up 😂😂😂
THEY'RE ALREADY 3 MONTHS!? 👀
Right choice on the cribs against the wall! Looks great :)
I went back and watched the glozel cinnamon challenge and it was hilarious
Shane, you make me pee a little during your baking segment.  Lol
I’m going to need more Cooking with Shane.  He was hilarious! 😂😂
I love watching him vlogs on a Sunday night before college
im gonna cry so. cute.  my heart.  love how you're doing this.  i love yall.
Love the Winnie the poo outfits and the voice ! 😂
😂 I love that Shane was able to turn his cinnamon rolls around and that Ryland loved them. A tip for the psycho cats--when I need to keep something safe and it can't get hot/cold, I just stick it in the microwave. Safe from all psycho cats!   I love watching both of you as fathers and seeing the boys grow. My heart melted when you showed his sweet little face during the bath. Congratulations to you both (again)! Thank you for sharing with us. ❤
As soon as I seen their faces I smiled 😊so darn cute
Let them crash in the bouncers for a nap. No demerit points for that, Dad's. ❤
Ok if you want to start cooking you have to become a Pinterest Queen!
I love seeing the baby’s!!! I’m so happy I saw jets little face, I hope you show max soon. They are adorable and have made my day
I love that you don't show their faces on video (except for the one face at bathtime he was so adorable). It's always good for them to not be shown much on the internet until they're old enough to understand internet safety.
WOOOOO! love seeing your faces in my feed!
Jet and Max are so sweet!
Ryland and Shane are in their parent era and I'm living for it. You two rock. I'm loving the parent/baby content. Also, Shane the chef we need more of this side of him. Love you guys.
I love you guys ❤ You are killing the fatherhood thang!😂
Omg so adorable
Love watching you guys ❤ made my sunday
I think that it is so cool to watch how happy you both are having those amazing little boys in your lives. I wish nothing but the best for your growing family. I love to see how much taking care of those cuties makes you both so happy and fulfilled in life. Being able to watch it is just so amazing. I am so happy for you guys.
The Boys are getting so big 🥹🥹🥹❤❤❤
Its crazy, because having a family is the direction I want my life heading in sooner than later
I absolutely love how respectful and tasteful you guys are about showing the boys , I love you guys ❤
I bet it would be super fun to start ASL (american sign language) with them now that they're trying to communicate!
I know ppl tried to cancel you and everything— but I am so happy to see you two THRIVING with your family
Ryland you’re doing so great!!! Ure the worlds best twin dad/mom My baby has to drink Goat milk too, she has a milk protein allergy her tummy couldn’t handle it
The faces shabe makes when cooking makes me want endless cooking contents. Ily
Thay was a great update ❤
i love the baby / parenting content! keep it coming
I have a stuffed Bell pepper recipe on my channel .
I just love you all so much! I know it’s all I ever say to yall but KEEP BEING AND DOING YOU! Please… whatever it is you want to do or show we will be here to watch and support 🥰
Jet is definitely Shane's baby
haha not GloZell! what a throwback! xxx
You guys... speaking of Hawaiian rolls.. MY HUSBAND HATES THEM, IVE NEVER MET ANYONE WHO HATES HAWAIIAN ROLLS BEFORE
I’m petitioning for Shane to start a cooking series!! And those babies are precious and I’m so proud of you both!
They both have become so much more confident in their daddy abilities and now they look like a couple of naturals. Those are some lucky little boys 😊
Im currently pregnant with a boy and when you showed your baby during the bath I just started bawling. They’re so so so cute!! Thank you for sharing them, but please don’t feel pressured to do so!
They look good Shane 😋
Can you please do a cooking series😭🙏🙏like seriously
What sheets are those called?
They need formula for the proper nutrition they should not be on milk till 12 months.
20:03 bouncy toy hanging above change table 🫶🏻 was my saving grace
Ryland is such an enthusiastic Mom. Shane is so damned entertaining! ❤
Yall will never see this but I just had a baby 8 weeks ago and hearing them cry in this video made me have a let down for my breast milk 😅😂😂😂
I love that shelf in the nursery SOOOO MUCH, I love the whole room but damn that's a nice shelf
I challenge both of you to learn to cook something at least once a week, start with vegetables and eggs, and expand your horizon with fish & meat. It will make your life as parents much easier, I promise❗️ PS it's good to see how happy parenthood make you both ❤
❤❤❤
Not the Glozell throwback 😂😂
Spencer is so cuteeee! 🥹
I’m just wondering does Shane actually help w the babies ?
Shane the dad I always wanted❤
They’re so beautiful omg 🥹❤️
Ryland what stroller do you use? Link it down below please. Future Mama Sept 24' 💜💙
Omg they are so cute!!! Thank you for sharing a glimps of them with us!! Your amazing parents!
their so adorable. Such a sweet family ❤ ❤
Shane: made from scratch ( bought rolls)
I was totally thinking it would taste like chicken parmigiana. Love sandy! ❤
the teardrop edit tho
I just have to say, I love that type of maple syrup. And the dessert looks really good I might to try and make that too.
Ryland seems to favour Jet, he is mentioned more in every single video...
Proud of you for trying to minimize showing your babies faces ❤️ there’s a more ethical way to be a family vlogger and I am glad you two are trying to show that you can ❤
Also thank you Shane & Ryland for making my baby fever 10000 times worse 🥹😂
Shane seems so much more comfortable
You should avoid any pure milk like goats milk or cows milk for infants for the first 6-12 months of their lives so I hope you switch to formula. Sincerely someone who works in a center with 125 infants.Goat milk based formula can be given from birth but not any straight milk, especially dairy for 12 months, a simple web md check works wonders.
Never knew we’d get Ryan and Shane dad era 🥲 you guys are doing great ❤
I knew Ryland would be an incredible, organized, efficient daddy,which I LOVE! But I did not expect Shane to be so calm and relaxed with the babies!!! They’re the best daddies in the world ❤!
Your fast Heartbeat in the middle of the night could be PTSD.
I loved seeing more of the babies!!!  Omg they are so so cute 🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️
Like this to see more Shane and Ryland cooking 🧑‍🍳
Those babies are just too cute omg!!
Jet & Max are fr the most precious, happy & beautiful babies I’ve ever seen 🥺🩵🩵
Stop hiding those babies from us! 😭 WE NEED TO SEE THEM
FIND the guy on YouTube that makes Toffee Bugles Churros !!!!!!
Shane's face when he didn't want to go outside 😂😂😂....Same!! I'm making the Hawaiian cinnamon rolls because YUM 🎉🎉🎉
Thank you for showing the babies! Adorable!
If Ryland ever burns cinnamon rolls again, get a cheese grater and shave off the burnt part and it's as if it never happened! You're welcome 😁
Ok. That whole episode was hilarious.
omg 19:25 so freaking cute my jaw dropped
You guys have such a great schedule for the boys! I love the consistency in your routines. Theyre growing up sooo quickly and we love to see all of the journey!!! ❤
Im a HARDCORE shane fan. Like im here to see shanes husband lol... BUT dose anyone else feel like hes true dad vibes and should be doing more? Hes doing amazing! But in terms of fairness... 2 babies.. 2 daddies... there was really no reason for ryland to be feeding both babies... unless shane was running the bath. Ill shut up who am i i dont know anything, lol
My daughter slept through the night from day one.  She is still crazy at 9 yrs old lol
You guys are doing so good with the boys. You’re fantastic papas!!! ❤ Gorgeous babies 😍😊💕
The icing definitely got a moment 😂
Your vids just get better all the time. I thought your schedule for the babe's was a bit extreme, then I added the twin aspect.  I am 100% confident this will make all-ya-alls' life so much easier!
I love following y’all’s journey because I have 4 month twin girls of my own!! When I was pregnant, I kept seeing signs it was twins and I asked for one more sign to be sure- I got on YouTube and y’all had announced twins. Found out 2 weeks later it was definitely twins!  Love following along. You can send this mama any extra stuff y’all have you don’t have room for😉it’s expensive for two out here 😂
I can't handle the cuteness.😊😊
No I want to see any kind of meals I love watching you guys cook and be domestic !
The schedule is SO IMPORTANT.  My daughter was on schedule as a child and now as a high schooler,  she still thrives better on a schedule, and it sets them up for just getting into a routine... love it.
Your doing amazing! Obviously if baby is asake and feeding 24/7 its not truly what they need. A schedual is so important 😊
When you cook cinnamon rolls, youre supposed to put them right next to eachother so they dont burn like when ryland made them. Youre supposed to put like 9 into a caserole dish so theyre all touching and theres no room between them. Shane putting them into a muffin tin is annoying me so badly. Theyre gonna burn. Cinnamon rolls dont cook properly when theyre seperated
I love love love the fact that I had my baby girl the same day that the twins were born! I love everything you both post especially about the babies because I can totally relate
Shane is slowly losing his mind 😂😅
In Canada they don't recommend milk until 12 months.
26:43 who's texting me? Gordon Ramsey He's shook 😂  Babies are soo cute 🥹🥹
I LOVE SEEING THE BABIES!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOD BLESS THEM
i need these vlogs to be a lot longer!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The boys are soooo adorable!! ❤
Thank you for the little peaks Here and there of your precious little nuggets ❤😊your routine is stellar!!! I think that is fantastic for daddies and babies :)
I just want to say..I love how the both of you share tasks to just make life with twins easier.  Love the team work...
Ive been trying to figure this out forever. Is it pronounced jERid like berry or jARed like bad
Best vlog ever! Shane, those rolls only needed 10 minutes tops at 300. 20 is way too long spot on with the frosting. You can add vanilla too
LMAO Jerod playing into Chris' fantasy with that Bear in a Bear costume. 😆
They deffinatley know thier shcedual in thier own way. Thats what a schedual dose for thier body
That was fun 😁
Shane’s I don’t want to go outside face is literally me everyday! Homebodies unite 😂
Those are the cutest boys ever!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Do you want to adopt me? I want to be loved as much as you love and care for your boys😭
Rylands baby ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Omg Jet is SO cute!!❤
I love them cooking!!!🧑‍🍳
But Shane, zucchini boats look really impressive, but are really easy and tasty.
Ryland your doing amazing
I know you don't always like to show your babies....but the shot of him in the tub was SOOOO CUTE!!! THEYRE ADORABLE!
The cinnamon roll thing made me want french toast casserole😂
Ryland and Shane littlerly slay at everything they do❤
22:24 I NEED someone to tell me if this clip has been anywhere else before… if not this is the longest most detailed deja vu and I’m kinda trippin…
Adore seeing you guys with the babies
Omg when shane was getting so excited after ryland tasted the cinnabites was the cutest ever 🥰
Listen, you don’t have to show your babies, but I got major tears- that’s a beautiful baby !!! Shane- what a sweet Daddy 🧑‍🍳! Ryland, you are a King Parent in charge, I love it!!! ♥️☀️♥️
I honestly was wondering about the crib orientation lol
New mom here,  your boys are beautiful and to help them it’s important to do more tummy time or lay baby on their side so they don’t develop a flat head. That’s what my pediatrician advised me and it’s helped me with my own son.♥️
I wanted to see the zucchini bowl... but ok 🙄
What goat milk formula are you using?
I 💯 completely understand not wanting to show them on the internet as a mom myself, but omg when you showed his little face my heart absolutely melted Ryland!! 🥹🩷
I think you both look great, but Shane I would say looks better than ever!!! You both also look so happy and I’m so happy for you both and I am loving the day in the life/ baby videos. It’s so fun to just see what you guys are up to pleaseee keep this up❤
omg, all those cameras kind of give me anxiety lol
Wait shane didnt know daylight savings existed lol? Or it just snuck up on him? Lol   Also love the onsie over the light ficture lol
I’m beyond ecstatic seeing you guys being such great twin dads! The sweet smiling boys are just perfect! ❤️❤️
❤
Why is one on goat milk and the other on cow milk?
So much fun watching Shane being creative in the kitchen adding the maple syrup into the frosting was such a nice touch!
Omggg they look so much like Shane!!!!!!
You guys are such great dads. Loved seeing the face of one soooooo beautiful. Maybe you could show us a picture of their faces. I respect you guys not wanting to show them live.
I love this episode!
spencer is so hot
Omg so cute 🥹🥹
Dealing with covid for the first time ugh. Thank you for posting Ryland! Gives me a chance to snuggle up & watch, and forget my woes
Is goat milk safe for babies that age? I thought it wasn't 🤔 13:20
Come see Taylor Swift in NOLA with me ❤ i have nosebleeds but it’ll be so fun!!
when the twins turned 3, please have a trip to Bali!! 😍 i'd love to show you guys around and have the time of your life❤ love your family so muuuuuch! been watching Ryland since clevver era🥰
I’m not trying to spread hate or anything but what are they planning on doing with the babies and having separate rooms? Are they really trying to stay at that California house? It just doesn’t seem like it’s made for all the things they need.
okay... jet has shawns fucking eyes. cutest thing ever
They are so cuteeee❤❤
Omg those precious faces ❤ 😭
When can twins sleep together? Or is that not ok?
Friend chicken pizza sounds great its basically chciken parm...
Best Vlog ever! Babies and Bearid! 🥰
During the reputation tour i was homeless when Taylor came to Seattle, and i stayed right down the street so i went and sat outside the stadium and i always say its the best concert ive never been to😂
Not showing their faces? Girl we all know they were born to be starts they a sag babies
When you flipped Jet over in the bath and I saw that beautiful little face I audibly gasped. ❤
Croc pot slow cooker, very easy,throw in forget about it
Shane in the kitchen. ICONIC.
Shane insisting he can cook and then ‘Postmates supper’ and spends the entire cooking time saying that he doesn’t know what he’s doing 😂😂😂. We love you Shane! 🥰.  (And then burns it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂). And Ryland loves them ! Who’d’a thunk it?
You both are adorable with them! So dear! xx
Shane is looking extra snatched lately ❤❤❤
the shout out glozell and cuts to her doing the cinnamon challenge took me outttt 😂😂😂😂
Awww this vlog was so adorable! You guys are such good dads 😍😍😍 and they’re SO CUTE ❤❤
Btw the heart beating rapidly a night Shane could be a sign of sleep apnea! You should get a sleep study
iv never seen that angle 22:09
They are adorable! Is it just me or does it seem like Ryland does most the work. He put the cribs together, he was the one that put the babies in the stroller, he was the one pushing the babies, he's the one that fed the babies and burped them, he's the one that bathed both the babies, he's the one that got both babies dressed. All Shane did was make some cinnamon rolls.😂 I feel like it would be a lot easier if Ryland bathed one baby and got that one dressed and then Shane could be bathing the other one while he's doing that. Ryland's running around like a chicken with his head cut off and Shane is just wandering around aimlessly like he has no idea what's going on 😂. Too cute though. Congratulations to you both. You are a perfect little family. ❤
Aww the boys💙💙 are so cute and love the cribs.🩵🩵
I am desperate for the Podcast!
@30:39 😂
*YAS MISS MOMMA!*  THERE'S NOTHING MORE FABULOUS THAN RYLANDS VLOGS/MAS *LIVE FROM COLORADO!!!*
You had a Taylor swift eras your movie ad in your video! I feel like that’s such a big deal!
I second those PBK sheets! I had them for my son's crib 14 years ago and they're the best! I still won't buy him anything other than PB sheets! 🤣
AHHHHHHHHH little cute baby faces!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍
I don't know but watching Shane hold his baby just sends tears down my face!! It's so precious and sweet! You both deserve all the love those boys will bring you!! ❤❤🥺🥺😍😍
Thanks for the update video!  made me smile thru out hehe
Do the zucchini boats
“It’s Gordon Ramsey, he’s shook” had me dying. Shane is so quick 😂
Hermosos!!! ♥️☀️♥️ I love so much you prioritizing their schedules because it’s soooo important and you guys are all over it!!! 😍😍☀️
as a Montessori teacher, i see routine and order as essential in life and work.  i love seeing you prioritize routine for the babes. it'll help them and YOU in the long run 💜
moving furniture around while baby is on the floor omg my anxiety 😭
You couldn’t have posted at a more perfect time🫶🏻
The way the twins are serving Gerber Baby Realness! TOO CUTE 😭♥️
So happy to see a vlog today.  Shane, you so could make cooking a new hobby.  I think you’d have a blast
In just curious how the one baby can drink cow milk i was under the impression you have to wait for almost a year before you can try that for health reasons, just wondering if you were advised otherwise or something because ive just never seen that before , no hate! Im just abit ignorant lol
"Girl" got me 😂😂😂
I never thought this would be something I wanted.. let alone NEEDED!! But if Shane makes low key cooking vlogs in his cooking journey.. I would freakin love that!!!
I'd be down to watch a cooking show, that's not all crazy but instead you actually trying to make meals that taste good
Shane I’m so proud 🤗you turned it around and didn’t give up ..they look yummy. The boys really are growing and your cribs are the best design I’ve seen. It melts my heart the way you both look at them 🥰totally in love , you’re both amazing. Take care xx xx
Stoppppppp! What little cuties🥹💕
“I have enough to where I can do it both ways!” When baking becomes bisexual goals 😂
The babies are so dang cute!!! 😍♥️😍♥️😍♥️😍
The  babies are soooo cute!!! You guys are doing such a great job. We need more of shane cooking. It looks so yummy.❤you guys!
You will have to update us on their sleep once the 4 month regression hits. Let us know if having the schedule helped with their sleep not really being affected or not. My son never had a schedule and those regression were rough.
About not showing their faces on the internet: I actually love the way you’re filming them, because they’re not the centre of attention, and more often than not they aren’t in the videos. But you’re also not avoiding the filming of them completely. Which makes it feel to me as a viewer that we sometimes get to see them but it’s not like: LOOK, HERES OUR BABIES! 👶🏼
They remind me of cam and Mitch from modern family 😩❤️
Ryland,  you’re such a cute mom. ❤❤❤
Shane , please start a cooking series. so we can all learn to cook with you 😂💕
Yay! New video 🤩
omg the babies are TOO CUTE 😭😭😭
Laying in bed snuggling with my pup and a new Ryland and Shane vlog on. Great way to spend my Sunday morning. After this its brunch!
Ryland posted, wake up

I’ve been waiting for this 😭❤️
They’re so cute 🥹🥹😭
Literally my fav video in awhile 😆 Shane had me rolling 🤷🏼‍♂️ kinda needed this lol 😝 ♥️ much love !!

5:20 I love the DIY light dimmer 😂💚🩵
I see a personal chef in their future.
The boys 🍼🍼 awww 😍
Shane and Ryland I have so many easy and delicious recipes!!!
I watched a old shane blog recently where shane didn't even have a pan or pot in his house....😂😂
Okay I know this was about solid solid foods but look into solidstarts for the twins! It’s an excellent tool when it comes to introducing new foods to them when they’re old enough! It’s been a LIFESAVER for me so maybe it’ll work for you guys too! ❤
It’s nice seeing u guys live ur life! U seem happy and fulfilled! ❤
5:20 me with ceiling fans as a child 😂❤
I need to know where shanes dog shirt is from!! 🤩🤩
Driving rn from the grocery store yes can’t wait to make dinner and watch this ❤️
Ryland is so cute
I was always on a schedule with my baby sleeping today. Was very strict about it but now my daughter sleeps realllllllly good so I'm happy.
I love seeing you and Shane in Dad Mode thank you so much for including these moments and giving us updates on Jet and Max 🙌🥰 You guys are such amazing Dads!!!!
It must be so fun to have a twin! A true soul mate 😍💜
Omg, I am melting watching that cute face in the bathtub. Ryland and Shane you guys are adorable. Much love to you all and stay blessed.
FOOD NETWORK WAS ALSO MY IPAD 😭
I didn't know that Ryland was do handy....he seemed soo femenine...but kuddos he is hard working dad
I am always happy and get a good laugh from your interactions and enjoy your adventures. Thank you for letting me forget about the insanity of the world for just a bit. Love to your little human and fur fam from Scotland. xx
Make monkey bread it's so easy and it's a 10/10. I'm also a Christmas cinnamon roll stand. Coffee n the rolls or it's not right 😂
Routine is so important, y’all are doing SO good 😭♥️
❤
Awhhh Jet's face getting a bath is the freaking cutest!!! And Max is adorable!!! Thank you for showing them!!! And you two are doing great!!!! Be proud!!! Don't let anyone tell you differant or say otherwise!!! They are stinking cute!!! Cute baby club!!!💙💙
We love you and your precious family!🥰♥️ The boys are growing so much, they’re little sounds melt my heart! So stinking adorable!
About the sheets-nothing beats bamboo for softness!!! Plus it’s good for eczema 💙
Why not get a stroller where you can have eye contact with both your babies?
The babies are soooo cute 😭♥️
Ryland you’re doing a great job with the boys 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 keep it up!
They grow so fast 😢 doesn't matter how much you try and absorb it, it goes soooo cast. They are beautiful, handsome boys.
Chips, dip, and a drink. I am ready for this.
*THE WINNIE THE POOH OVERALLS*
Ryland is such a mom and I’m here for it❤
what team is spencer playing for because i want to submit my resume
🤍
Oh my god they so precious. You guys got the routine down! But just wait till they have a regression and youll wonder what happened lol.
You could have put them in a casserole dish that's what they're supposed to be put in
I had four boys they were all 2 years apart and I used to stick them like you do in the Sun and their bouncers the two yrs old and the infant. They Loved that too!❤
You both are amazing parents & Ryland is such a mom ❤❤ xox it will get easier, I promise ❤❤❤
I need more Cooking with Shane ❤hahah
Omg Bebe in the bath! I can’t 🥰🥲🥹  Thank you for trusting us to show his face, because that was so cute.
❤❤❤
These videos make me miss the baby stage 😭 my son is turning 7 they LITERALLY do grow up so fast 😭💖🙏🏻
The mobile is giving Poliwag (the Pokémon w the swirl on the belly) 🩵
Seeing Shane and Ryland holding the babies just makes my heart so happy ❤
Of course they bought those babies to monetize
You didn't make Rylan the zucchini boat thing he BEGGED FOR!!?? 🙄
Jet is everything oh my God he's so adorable thank you for showing him!😊❤
Three months already omg ❤
Hey Ryland, be careful about where you let them sleep. I knew someone that her baby fell asleep in the car seat so she brought him into the house and let him sleep in the seat. The baby passed from positional asphyxiation. The oxygen was cut off like a kink in a hose. Just wanted to let you know 🖤 I feel like info like this should be spread all over the internet . Also this was just a PSA for any new parents out there
Yay clicked right away ! ❤
I love your videos!!
Makes me so happy seeing how well things worked out for you two🥹 love love love you both
yayy new vlog!!
Make the foods that you want to eat. It doesn't matter if it's fast and easy or if it's all drawn out. Make the food for you two not us.
Omg Jet just kicking and kicking like “dad! Dad! I wanna help you build!” 🥹🥹 so so cute and when he’s in the tub!! Stop!!! Omg my heart, cutest baby ❤ I LOVED seeing Shane cook. You are so so creative I bet you could come up with some amazing dishes.
I am loving rylands mom era. Having a 4 month old is so fun to grow with them in this journey
I’ll never get over how cute y’all are with the boys ❤
Need more spooky and ritual conspiracy’s
Ahhhhh look at those strong boys!!!
Does ryland have one green eye and one blue one... I love you even more now ❣️
❤❤
Shane you're looking awesome you really doing good I'm proud of you! Ryland you look thin and trim and doing great yourself. Love you both & your boy dearly. ❤🎉 Happy Saint Patrick's Day guys!
More Spencer yaaaay🤩 I love seeing more of this awesome legend popping up in your vlogs and Shane’s vids :)))
Omg yes me and my sick husband needed this sm ❤️❤️
I'm really confused, I thought you weren't going to show the boys on camera really? It seems your videos are now 100% about the boys which I understand (not really a family channel fan but anyways) but it seems to go against what you originally said about how you wanted to handle it once the boys were born?
I’m loving these new vlogs
i love how much more consistent these videos are  get that bag
So happy for you two. Best dads ever
I remember Shane cooking way early in his life with his Mom. I've been watching this man since he was just starting out on YouTube. Lol
Bearlebrity Jerid is the best vlog cameo EVER!!!!!!! Love the SDP behind scenes awesomeness 🤩🐻
😊😮😊
I LOVE YOUR BABY CONTENT. I NEED MORE VLOGSSSS❤
Okay I watched the Disney + Eras Tour Taylor’s Version and I’m like I NEEED TO SEE THIS LIVE!!! Also trying to get to the Miami show 😂
