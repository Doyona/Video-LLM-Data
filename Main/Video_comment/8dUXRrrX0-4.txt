I been a Celtic fan since the day i was born,48 years ago and have seen many good players and good times and some not so good players and some pretty awful times but for as someone who travels from Essex in England to watch the games at paradise, i got to say hattate is f***in quality
Mooy was great that day.
I miss Mooy. Had such an amazing season and was crucial in so many big games. May he rest in retirement.
Damn I miss this 🥲
That second Celtic goal is really underrated
The day the CELTIC GLASGOW chant was born. you just had to be there
Jock stean still best celtic manager ever
"Mooy takes his eye off it, I'm not sure if he was committed enough" -Ali McCoist  Nah - Morelos pushed Mooy full force in the chest to give himself space, and if Mooy went down that goal gets chopped off as the ref was looking straight at it. Ange sussed how to deal with that in the next game with agent Johnston 🍀
Goal kyogo!!!!!
The Treble is a certainty
I'm gonna stick my neck out and say their is ever chance of the Celtic Doing Ten n a Row because CELTIC are years ahead of the ROTTEN mob WELSHYBHOY FAE CASTLELMILK GLESGA
Model is blessing himself whilst his fans sing about Catholics being killed! Honestly it's backward
The view count for this video is amusing. It should be comfortably higher.
4:29 who ate all the pies?
Glasgow Celtic never fail to play good football HH
Super day and thouraly enjoyed it on the way to the treble
💚😂
Should've finished 5-1💪🇮🇪
Hatate Mooy McGregor we never stop they never start 🇦🇺🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤️🌏

Notice how not one celtic fan comments on bernabei escaping a red card for his red card tackle yet had he played in a blue Jersey you green and white lot would be screaming for a sending off. Hypocrites. Let's see all your replies to this.
💚😎🇮🇪🍀💚😎🇮🇪🍀🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉
See that tonight Robbie Nielson finally says what everyone else is thinking in that a rival player needs to get decapitated before a referee sends off a celtic player. Disgusting and their so called fans claim this is a club based on love, acceptance and equality.
We Spanked you rednecks from start to finish again. Ooh Aah up the RA Celtic ploughed through you with ease for the 2nd goal by Kyogo.    I,I,IRA
Beale totally focused on the Celtic end 🤭👍
Not a Celtic fan but always enjoy seeing the inbred scumbags that are Rangers fans lose out.
Rangers fans delighted to see Morelos blessing himself after he scored 😂😂😂🍀🍀🍀🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Liverpool fan, with a big soft spot for Celtic, good to see you trounce the bootlicking royalists as usual.
Imagine how many goals Larsson would have scored in this team 😳
The surface is a disgrace for a national final . By the way just incase I forget  Celtic 🇮🇪 are the champions
one day a barosic  tifo will appear 😆
Lucky Ange 😂😂😂
All of this could have been different if Aaron Ramsey had scored THAT penalty.
Celtic v the Ungrateful Dead
Kamara is dugmeat. Laziest player to ever wear the famous blue, always 15 yards off the man he's supposed to be marking. Awful awful awful.
Poor poor Rangers performance no balls, time to clear out the dead wood.
Another trophy the norm
No masonic conspiracies this weekend from the cheated never defeated.
Looks like Celtic dominate this old firm derby, no matter what competition they are both facing..
2 well taken goals
Forget about the teams but I thought for the first time in a long time the referee had a brilliant game he let play go and cautioned when he had to he controlled the players and didn’t let the atmosphere get to him I know it’s been documented that he’s a rangers fan but he was great in my opinion for the first time in a long time we aren’t talking about the officials so well done Nick Walsh at the end of the day the better team won! COYBIG ☘️☘️☘️
Get Celtic and Rangers to join premier League NOW‼️
Nice to see a man blessing himself in a Rangers jersey.
MON THE HOOPS CMON YOU BOYS IN GREEN
I think Lucky Ange is going to become a meme
What a team what a manager and what a set of fans 🍀🍀🍀 always and forever better in everyway than the scum in blue
🇮🇪
Still gutted that haksabanovic and O'Riley missed they chances at the end and kyogos first 2 at that start aswell shoulda been about 6-1😭😂
Out sung ,out played, out classed ,for celtic natural order has been restored Glasgow Celtic Champions 💪💚💚💚🍀
morelos the buffet king
It’s good to see Cantplaywell is really living up to his name ☘️☘️
Am I the only one who thought the delivery of this highlights package was pish?
V
My Irish blood and Celtic heart.
Met Ange in Australia on a few occasions, and he's a top bloke, was a great player, and you just know ANY team he's involved with is going to be a fighting force. That Kyogo is a livewire. Go Stoke.
Hatate and Mooy absolutely superb. The first goal when Hatate picks it up, he has 2 easy opportunities to play a back/sideward pass to McGregor as he's facing away from goal, the composure to turn and always be forward thinking is just brilliant, and then Mooy, his touch and clinical passing was immense. What a team. Hatate is just unbelievable, hard to pick a favourite player from this side but I have to go for him. God bless Ange and these bhoys <3
Great derby this but to call it the best derby in the world is so self-centred and delusional. There are rivalries abroad where fans aren't even allowed to meet eye-to-eye. 😳
Another Ibrox Disaster on the way
Rangers have the Best goaly in the league
Remove those 2 japoneses from the celtic and they are nothing 😂
UTLR cmon ange the main man 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪 FTK
Japan + Celtic is a match made in heaven
Beale got lucky in the last 5 mins
low level…～
Hatate’s nutmeg on Connor Goldson for Kyogo’s 2nd goal was the icing on the cake!
Farmers league Moy looking like kdb in that league
Scottish cup all belong to celtic 🤣
Back post Barišić was fantastic again. I'm envious of the view he gets to watch the Celtic goals
Another trophy for the famous hoops HH
What a team 🍀 22 trophies in 11 years, that’s what you call setting the standards.
aaron mooy the 🐐
CELTIC AND FREE PALESTINE
Both goals thanks to Mooy Passes
Mon the celts
Yellow cards aren't highlights, they are trivial.
Another thing so much for all there injury problems .💚🤭 Morelos blessing himself 🤣
Another trophy bought 👍🏻
Do The Rangers fans seriously have no shame about them whatsoever? Not that long ago I saw a video of one of their fans doing a Nazi salute and praising Hitler and now singing and chanting during a period of remembrance and reflection for a man who lost his life. A truly horrible club with an appalling fan base.
hon the bhoys
Rangers are a diddy club
Good to see Morelos blessing himself when he scored 🇻🇦 📿
Too easy and not to mention the back up on the bench too .
sell all the players bring new ones in
lundstram not marking or putting the effort in to match that run cost us that first goal. lazy
rangers supporter have to say we are shite. gonna be big trouble at ibrox
Good of var to let fat boy away with a blatant push on Mooy when the fk comes in that's how he had the space . Joke
Not one Celtic player put a foot wrong all day ... The interception from Starfelt to turn things over and start the 2nd goal.  Cal Mac was outstanding from the first minute.   Great game. Hail hail 🍀
Im interesting in where Furuhashi will continue his career
Beales 2 super January signings sitting on the bench. Obviously he knows they are mish mash. Guffaw guffaw
Rangers trash 🗑 singing during the minutes applause 👏
Good win, a bit flattering to gers, probably should have been 4 or 5 to 1.
The ref w/ Specsavers sponsor lol
There is only one team in Glasgow!’ Glasgow Celtic!!
Up the Celts!
Hey ther yiu wae the sad face
Can you see a happy hun no no
Hey ther yiu wae the sad face ahahhahahahahhahahHahahhahahahha
morelos looks like he is at a famous pastry shop every morning at 9 am seven days a week
Go on Kyoto! Nice one Celtic 🍀
Mooy....sublime.
Were wid we be without big Ange hh big man 🍀🇨🇮
such a hard competition to win ???????
Only ones worse than them Celtic
Congratulations to Celtic, from a Rangers fan! A great game of football from both sides.
Celtic. 🔥
Always enjoyable seeing Newco Rangers lose any game but especially to their city rivals in a final. 🧡🖤
Best team in Scotland truly showed.. hh
Kyogo and Hatate is like Tsubasa and Misaki
Mad that Japan didn't select Kyogo for the World Cup when they were lacking a finisher for all their industrious play.
It should have been CELTIC v Rangers as they are the champions defending the title, not rangers v celtic. This insinuates advantage to rangers as the home team. BUT THEY LOST ANYWAY. LOL
🍀🇵🇸
Had the referee and still lost hail hail
Golden opportunity lost to the oompas from parkhead
25000 rangers fans wise up  use run out of the stadium use are some supports🤣🤣🤣
Best thing for Scottish football would be everyone resign from the system and reform their own league and DON@T allow the both cheeks of the same arse to join it !  Scottish football would flourish and the old firm could then thuck off and join the English pyramid system or one of the Irish leagues .
3:22　Japanese triplets 涙でるわ
The losers coming 2nd once again!! 😆😆😆😆🤣🤣😆 see if it wasn’t for set pieces or penalties this mob wouldn’t score a fuckin goal! Shower a fuckin shite and the champs won in 2nd gear yet again! All the talk and bullshit before the game as per usual and their arses collapse yet again!! Tin pot club,tin pot manager,tin pot players,and most of all tin pot fans who made noise during a minutes applause for someone’s passing then were never heard again 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆 ange has the lots number and they know it tae!!! 😱😱🤣🤣🤣
I don't give a damn if rangers lost I am glad because it made Michael Beale look bad hahaha 😂😂😂
What a kyogo
Cantwell 🤣🤣🤣
Celtic deserved the win…. Better tactics…. And better team on the day….
Man U ❤️❤️
Mon the tic
“Lucky Ange” 😂😂💚💚🍀🍀
Beautiful sunday ❤️🍀
Any Hand Ball …..from the Fat Boy …..😡and still nothing done ….
Celtic superior in every way today
The  Rangers defence was really bad for the want of a better word , ran through them like a hot knife through butter ,  sorry I have to say it they were fu-king crap
🍁 Johnston 💪🏽
Hope Beale stays for a long time😃
Should have been a rout given all those chances in the second half,poor poor misses but who cares now!!
Morelos blesses himself after scoring…gets dragged off 😂😂😂😂
That’s exactly what Beale & Sakala get for talking before the game…Glasgow is Green hail hail ☘️
Good performance by the Bhoys.  What I'm seeing from these highlights is that Haksabanovic is quite the player.  He needs a little more game time and he will be unsettling defences everywhere.
Well done lads.  Well played Old Firm derby
Scumbags they are but then again, we are a club like no other, brilliant Bhoys 🇮🇪🇮🇪☘️☘️
First thing Beale does when walking out of the tunnel is look over to the Celtic fans
Japan at the top 🇯🇵👑
Why was this game on TV!! Stop paying TV licence!!
What is the saying  luck of the irish
Morelos blessed himself when he scored. The current buns wont like that
That's,right,put,the,score,up Then,show,the,highlights

Maizan actually tried to play it on for Kyogo. If he had made contact Kyogo would have finished anyway. ✅
Lucky bunch of unwashed b******s as per usual,
Funny all celtic fans thinking they all that, celtic didn't play great neither did rangers, all goals had luck in them, rangers bad defending let celtic in, dissapointing rangers don't go into the game with attacking mentality but start of beale era and plenty of trophies ahead
Mutants
If you look at the Rangers goal, Mooy gets a massive shove in the back as the kick is played in. Where was VAR on that one?
The editing of this video is terrible.
Vamos Celtic!👩‍👩‍👦‍👦🍀🍀

Just a game
1:06 3:15
We were robbed.the ref and var was against us.our turn to complain about the official now.yeha.watp.we don't care.😇
Rangers just aren’t good enough.
Mooy was unbelievable 🍀
Probably maedas worst game for us and we still win😃
Man of the match - The Referee - who I thought got it right most of the time!
bro if added a filter and told me this was early 2000s footage i'd believe you
Ozzie Ozzie Ozzie!!!!
Never thought I’d of said this before kick off but Nick Walsh had a good game today for a change but well done bhoys bursting the moles bubble unreal 🍀
Saad is going to be a good player for Celtic
Too funny when fat fredo celebrates like hes just rattled in the CL final winning goal ahahahahahahahaha
Feel likes as a outsider that Celtic seem to have the edge over Rangers in big games that matter. Rangers just seem to crumble with the expectation.
decent game to be fair on a dodgy pitch.
Japanese Samurai Kyogo doubled his contribution to the trophy
Can i just say as a celtic fan , get it fkin right up you hun b*stards 😁🍀
What was it that out of fashion said were better than celtic 🤔 right 22 trophies yes deffos their a lot better 🤣🏆👍🎉 hail hail
373replys and not a Scottish flag anywhere , if u wanna be Irish then join the Irish league WATP
The little fat guy up front for sevco has got a bigger chin and gut than an over weight pig🐖🐷🐽🤣🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇪
Morelos looking like an ex player who has hit the booze. How does he get a game  , he must be 20 Stone. HailHail
Another losers medal for the great Tav 😂😂😂 unfortunately for sevco fashion sakala done the Celtic team talk during the week when he opened his mouth but as usual they can’t back it up , pure an utter Celtic dominance
古橋はステップアップしないと代表にはいらない
Celtic should of won 4-1 😂😂😂
LOVE Kyogo the Japanese samurai and a Celtic ledgend! What a player, 100x better than legbreaker son who is the most over rated player in the UK!
Hatate is player of the year
Oh wit morelos celebrating like he's just scored the winner in a world Cup final shows how desperate they are to beat us
Two very VERY poor teams that would be league 1 in England at best
This is KYOGO FINAL!!!!!
My mate Robbie wanted to say he’d make love with kyogo
Glasgow and Scotland is green 🍀
Celtic the best team in Scotland for over 10 years.
Why is the pitch so awful?
What is this cup? Is this a league cup like the carabao cup? Real question
#COYBIG
Celtic have goal scorers, rangers have donkeys.
2:30 the other mob btw
How do you feel 😂😂😂
So japaneasy. Back under yer rocks ya scumbags.
First goal - two Gers defenders leave it.  Laughable.  League 2 football.
Warter Smith devastated!
Best in Scotland
Strachan looking pleased as punch near end
Rangers saved from a pumping by a pensioner 😄.
Best team won. Now the treble.🍀🍀🍀
The cookie monster blessed himself.
Yasssssss, what a game.
Yaaas troops 🍀🔝🍀🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🔝🍀 Hail Hail 🇮🇪
Not a fan of either side but it’s good to see an Old Firm game without one set of fans reduced to under 1,000 like in the league. The passion and atmosphere is what has made the fixture attractive to me down the years
Another great performance and another trophy in the cabinet,the Japanese connection again proving the difference,we have quality all over the pitch now it's a joy to watch long may it continue,and something that the other mob across the city. can only dream about
OK we will give you this one but we are getting closer our time ain't far away ..we are coming to get ya ..Big Jock knew look how far we have come I remember you as a club when you got 14000 gates ..
Best team in Scotland. They scumbags will always be in our shadow 🍀
Celtic the less crap of two crap teams.
Kiyogo
Haksabanovic is an absolute liability. We should have won 4-1 if it wasn't for his selfishness and ball hogging. PASS THE FREAKING BALL.
Ooh well, looks like it's that time again, to add yet another to empty threat to the hurting Hunnery list that is forever evolving! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Maida wat a battler  chasing  down  every ball    like a samurai 🇯🇵
It is disappointing these are the only highlights of today's final. All the old boys over 70 will be waiting to watch this on Terrestrial TV later either as they don't have the money, the health or the abilty to understand newer tech. Football is leaving generations behind and that's not right!
Terrible highlight reel. Missed the kyogo long shot over the bar. The cause of the free kick goal. The free kick resulting from cantwell being fouled. No explanation for the yellow card fracas that was the cause of the minutes added either. This is so disjointed it's fucking appalling. BT and SPFL do the best highlights channels for the scottish game. but this might even be worse than sky. Take note!
Hi
You just can't teach what Kyogo does. It's pure instinct. That said, he's got the support around him. Maeda's run for the first goal was more important that it looked because it took some of the attention from Kyogo and the fact that Maeda missed it was fortunate in the end. Kyogo could have been forgiven for missing it because he didn't have a lot of time to react! Great win - a very big win. Well done to the team. Hopefully that's one down two to go!
Scottish fans are different
Mon the hoops , Glasgow always green and white hope u enjoy that fat sally .. treble on it way TAL💚🏆
We're turning japanese I really think so kyogo, mieda, and hattati pure genius god bless ange well done celtic. Great performance, the. Difference between thinking you're good and being good was witnessed today. Hail hail the celts are here.
💚🇮🇪
Kyogo Goal
Ha the Rangers lad blessing himself.
The Japanese Job
The ugly sisters of Scottish football
Nothing tastes better than salty Hun tears on your Sunday night fish and chips supper. 🇮🇪🏆🇮🇪
You could tell by the faces on the celtic team they where determined to put  sevco on there place
To quote Sutton at the end, "Lucky Ange" :D
The Colombian Michelin man finally scored. Lol
Horrible, horrible, horrible people from the arse hole of Britain.
Get it up ye Huns
Apparently Tav is still on the pitch waiting to take his penalty
God bless you Ange!!! 🍀🏆🇮🇪 Up the Celts!!!!!!
They(SFA) tried to stop us and failed. As for that “other mob”…Well…?🤷‍♂️. Know yer place Billy 💚
The real difference was Kyogo. Celtic deserved their win. My team was poor. No excuses. Maeda did some amount of running as well. I would be surprised if Celtic manage to hold onto those two after the summer, especially Kyogo.
Such a close game I thought the referee was a bit biased to Celtic like every game
Do yer talkin on the pitch, fkn end of  😎
Celtic on top 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Juhuuuuuuu !! :)
Kyogo is Rangers Boogeyman...& our Talisman 🍀🍀👍👍
Morelos is a podge 😂
Glasgow is green and white ✊️🍀
we are such a good team we make them look better than they actually are men against boys again
I don’t see any good Scottish player here good effort Japanese boys gotta teach them now
Should have scored 5 😂 Glasgow is still Green and White 💚🍀
HH 🍀
that second goal started by Carl Starfelt...beautiful move
Morelos trying to jump after he scored 🤣🤣🤣🤣 How can a professional footballer be so overweight?
LOVE seeing the SCUM lose
No pens=can't win...cmon the super hoops.🇮🇪
Well done Celtic 💚👌 the best team in Scotland 💯
"Lucky" 😎
Hail hail
The better team won in the end of the day, I just hope that rangers learn from this mistake, start inform players instead of your personal favourites
Lucky Ange 🍀💚🍀
And we are only going to get better 🇮🇪
Angelos!
NEVER STOP BHOYS
Rangers Beale scraping for help it’s not happening
🍀🏆🍀🏆🍀🏆
Get it up yeez ya hun bastards
Cmon CELTIC ✊ Best Team and Only Team In Glasgow 🏆 What a Job Ange Has Done What a Team ☘️💚☘️💚🇮🇪🇮🇪 HH
Delighted with this win. Great job the hoops.
3:27 And what is this flag doing there ?
Both these clubs should be shunned by world football. Especially those in blue, horrid haters that they are, but also those in green who should be chucked out of the Scottish Leagues and into the Irish one. Glasgow is the most unfriendly place on Earth. Their version of a kiss is a headbutt
Morelos blessed himself:)
Kings of Scotland 🍀🍀
Easy Work #HailHail
Rangers are still the most successful club in the world ❤️🤍💙🤫
Good game!🏆🤓🏆
This fixture is the one where you get more moronic, racist idiots fitted into a relatively small place. Seething with hate, full of horrible people. And not a Scotland flag in sight. Celtic fans who hate Scotland with Irish flags and Rangers fans with Union flags who hate Scotland. Thousands of horrid can'ts.
Bad luck Sevco
Rangers no hope Ian Beale. We can’t win without help
Fat boy Morelos has been looking for a transfer away from The Rangers for years. He must be thinking I'll bless myself, and that should get me the transfer.
The Kings of Scotland 🍀
We set the fucking standards. 🍀
Trust the process, Angeball 🍀
It would be nice to have Scott Brown in there with the cup he is  a proper Tim years of service he has gave
Rangers German 90 team
Get it up sakala ya wank 🍀
celtic are magic ffs
Looks like it was an absolute Banger of a game.
☘️🇮🇪Up The Celts🇮🇪☘️
If we had took our chances in the last 10 minutes it would have ended up a rout !
Morales blessing himself at the goal 😂, bet that went down well with Rangers fans
i'm still laughing at the fact Ryan Kent calls himself a footballer
Cheers from Italy 🇨🇮🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇪
Clayton's trophies when only 2 teams can  realistically win anything in Scotland 🥱🤔
Fatmo erlos scored n blessed himsel 😂 💚
🇨🇮🙏🇨🇮
Celtic v Rangers YAWN
Sevco shouldn't be this close to Celtic, being a 10yo club. Celtic need to spend on better quality.
That's why we're Champions 🍀⚽ Great solid performance from Celtic  I love you Celtic with all my heart 💚
how many asian players do celtic have lmao
Simply the Celtic !!!! Still at the top !!!
The  cheat ref Walsh handing the small east end club a trophy again.  🥰   Rangers denied a blatant penalty in the first half.  Embarrassing for Scottish football.
Well done Paedo FC 👏😏
#champsofviaplay
Going to work tomorrow happy as Larry hail hail the treble is on what a time to be alive
Oooft. Rangers fans must be Bealin’!
Well done Celtic and this from a Protestant who has supported you for the last 50 years!!
Champions again ole ole
Must be Bealein’  Laughs aside, that pitch is absolute trash.
thought Fashion Sakala was going to prove who the best team in the country was?
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAH 🍀
Hunskelping as usual
'I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese,  I really think so,'
Fucking easy.
Tavernier as Rangers captain has witnessed Celtic lifting 18 trophies🤣🤣🤣 they never learn we are Celtic HH ☘️🇮🇪☘️🇮🇪
Best team in Scotland end story
22 trophy’s in 11 years. This team jjst keep on winning what a time to be a Tim. Hail hail 🍀🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇪
Boring league and boring cup. Same teams 🥱😴
Mind the gap Sakala
Lucky Ange😂😂😂
Well deserved win … although some sitters in the final minutes … but who cares, we have won a final against rangers 🍀🍀🍀
celtic are the best
What a team
JAPAN will be so proud! Hero! 🙏👍❤️
That mob belting out The Billy Boys during the minutes applause for Ron Gordon.  Shameless pack of tramps but totally expected
Respect the champions 🍀🍀🍀
Good final Celtic creating too many chances but rangers tried but kyiogo too good
From The Ashes Of 1916 tifo was top drawer too..
Celtic will always be The Bigger Club, more historic, and more beloved by all fans across the Globe comparrd tp Rangers! Former Champs of Europe, first British n last Scottish Club ever to win European Cup! Rangers can compete, but never compare or Celtic History as a very special club! And I'm an Aston Villa supporter! 👍🙏❤️
Those 2 goals is what Angeball is all about.
Morelos even blessed himself before coming on 😂 they'll not like that 😂😂😂🇮🇪🍀
Sunday football 🤣
🇮🇪 🎉🇮🇪 🎉🇮🇪
The other mob doing what they do best      Hun skelping 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🇮🇪🇯🇵🇮🇪🇯🇵🇮🇪🇯🇵🇮🇪🇯🇵🇮🇪🇯🇵
HH 💚🏆🍀
Classy as ever from Rangers fans to sing their caveman songs over the minute's applause for Ron Gordon. Surely the worst set of fans on earth. Get it up them. Edit to add: To all the Rangers fans underneath deflecting with stuff Celtic fans have done, I'm not a Celtic fan so that means nothing to me. Sort yourselves out before criticising others.
I think Celtic would second in the league and challenge in the cups if you only counted our goals scored from cut backs across the 6 yard box from the left wing 😂
🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Kyogoal 🔥
Contact the hoops
"22 trophies in 11 years" Considering you had almost a decade of champions league money and a Rangers team full of free agents, I wouldn't consider it magnificent. Bottled 10IAR anyways, threatened to murder your board whilst petrol bombing their houses haha we set the standards of not attacking our team and board.
Good guys win once again.
Lucky Ange's other mob outclassing Rangers on the biggest stage LOL  Is John Lundstram still 'the best on earth' after that performance? 22 trophies in 11 years
Sevco Snake slithering away for Hampden
Imagine being this lucky.. 22 times in 11 years.
Met this chap, Morelos, last summer in a Titty Bar in Bangkok. Top bloke!
Beale made wrong decision in playing unfit tilman and lundstram,,but Celtic were better team on the day. Although rangers did play better after they scored..(Gers fan).
Mon the hoops,from castlebar co,mayo
Hail Hail the CELTS are here 🇮🇪
Kyogo is a baller
🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Lucky Ange 😂
Easy today bhoys🇮🇪
As always, one team doing their talking on the pitch, the other off of it. Only one outcome really.
Rangers goal was a push on Mooy
What a team what a club
