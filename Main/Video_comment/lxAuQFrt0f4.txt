Guys pick Cole palmer trust me
Looking back at this..(also first comment in 8 months)
Hello, Checking the app they disabled manual substitutions? They will re-enable?
I saw my team and its a 93/100 idk if that is good but im thinking of changing stones for estupinan on matchday 2
Eduard is a good option for 5.5
taking all the notes 📝
Not feeling Eze in these teams....  I think Palace will struggle and him and Olise can't do it on their own all season!  Also Joao Pedro ahead of Undav at Brighton? Undav finished last season so strong and scored some quality goals I think this season will be his year.  Bundeia would have been in mine as preseason he was quality but now injured.  Diaz and Mudryk both looked 🔥 in preseason.  Those putting Martinelli in ahead of Saka, Trossard will be pushing really hard for a start on the left for us this season whereas Saka is guna get more mins ...  Good luck lads FOOTBALL IS BACK!!!! ⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽
How are you leaving Salah out when’s he’s never not scored on the forts game of the season .. bruh
Thoughts on trossard?
Hi mate. I'm not sure whether to go and play a 3-5-2 with mbeumo mitoma and joao Pedro/ Watkins (not sure who to go with please help) or 3-4-3 with mitoma gone and Pedro and Watkins up front?
Thoughts on dahoud?
I want Trippier and Jota but there is no way I can fit them in
Finally we've missed these videos so much❤ Hope you win it this season Andy👍
Where do I find your league code Andy
Mbeumo shows injured
Mbeumo injured 😮
Ferguson or joao pedro??
Not having Haaland almost never pays of?
This is such a boring team
What’s the point of FPL now, no one is making decisions themselves anymore, just relying on algorithms lol
Will mbuemo start?
bruno or rashy
Fernandez or rashford?
Harry kane to bayern
I missed this...LET'S GET THIS STARTED BOIZZZZZZ!
I’ve got the exact same team expect I’ve got trossard instead of martnelli and stones instead of pinnock is this ok? Just so r have back up on bench
Why does everyone have Gabriel when Timber could easily start over him? Saliba is the smart pick surely...
Great video Andy. I'm scared to go without Salah also but the value from having multiple high level midfielders is just too good this season I think.   I actually made a slight change to my (nearly identical) team based off of your comments and have somehow found the money to bring in James alongside Chilwell like you have also in your 2nd draft. I usually NEVER trust Chelsea defence but their fixtures look too good.  If you had to play James and Chilwell vs. Liverpool do you think it would be that bad?   Good luck for the season!
Pls rate my team:  Gk: Steele Def: Stones, Estupinan, Gabriel Mid: Odergard, Rashford(V), Fernandes, Saka, Mitoma FW: Haaland(C), Watkins  Sub: Areola, Colwill, Kabore, Mubama
Is buendia a good choice depending on pre season
I'm with you on the Salah draft. Its so tempting. All the goals Liverpool are scoring and he's the main man there. And it's freaking Mo Salah he always scores points.
Ferguson up front? How's he been looking in preseason?
3 Brighton Player's that's a Red Flag  mate🚩
How is Trossard inplace of Martinelli? Also is Jota a better option for having ha Liverpool attacking option?
Why would you go for gabriel and not ben white
Absolutely nothing original as per usual. I’ve watched 3 of these vids in 5 mins and all 3 are the EXACT same team
Really struggling on Watkins, Salah, Pinnock vs Kane, Diaz Estupiñan. Having Kane and Salah both as differentials feels too hard to ignore but threemium would sacrifice Bruno and Saka which I don’t want to do
Andy sleeping on Liverpool.
Why gabriel over saliba ?
Cannot understand Pickford. There's not a team in the league that can't comfortably score against Everton.
4 arsenal players?
No Trent?!
Congrats Andy on another milestone, amazing numbers. What do you think about Lewis Hall as 4.5m defender option? He moved from Chelsea to Crystal Palace on loan. Do you think it's too risky to pick Timber who looked xLively against City in community shield over Gabriel?
Is Darwin nunes worth taking? am no sure about him
I would not put my trust in haaland especially not with De bruyne being a doubt😂😂😂
Hi Andy, pls rate and comment on my current draft: (4-4-2)  Mendy -  Stones Chilwell Estupinan Gabriel -  Salah(VC) Rashford Mbeumo Saka - Haaland(C) J. Pedro - Subs: Turner Soucek (could be any 5.0 Mid) Baldock Mubama.  Thx!
Thoughts on Stones?
Currently have a NO Haaland draft (some say crazy)
bro called udogie as you doggy 😭
Can you please make draft for Kane and Haaland.......
Andy is back hyping Salah. FPL is really back! 🎉
If Kane stays which it’s looking like he will now, surely he’s essential
The closer we are to the deadline, your draft starts to look exactly like mine 😮, don't know if that's a good thing or bad 😅 I thought i was going differently this season
Where do we find FDR bro
Not having jota is just admitting you don't watch football 😫🤷🏽‍♂️
johnstones or onana?
I’m taking Odegaard over Martinelli since Trossard will be playing a lot due to his amazing form
I am simply starting Salah because it is easy to get to Kane if he stays and if Salah doesnt start well he is easy to downgrade. If Salah starts well and you dont have him goodluck getting to him.
Im sacrifice halland to get bruno, rashford, odegard, saka, salah in the mid 😅.
You don't rate picking Joao Pedro I see.
I’m 100% Salah. Crazy to go with out him
For sure we will see an upset, forest beating Arsenal? Luton winning? Burnley tie 0-0?
Udogie has been absolutely class for Spurs, just so you know. Much better than Reguilon.
Trossard will take minutes from the CF or LW spot he has been one of Arsenals most inform players and is a game changer when on the field. I could see arteta starting him over Martinelli to have Martinelli pace to come off the bench around the 60 65 minute.
Let's not forget Salah always scores in GW1
My ratings are 98%, but i probably will end up at the bottom of my leaderboard😂
About a week ago I realized you could get this decently balance draft with Salah in it (few differences like Jackson in attack).  Been really happy, but now more people are starting to get Salah in too 😅
anyone got a league that i can join?
my team is mainly template but I've seen no mention of Solanke from anybody hes got West Ham (H) in the first match as well. Am I missing something?
Why arnt people not putting trent in anymore wtf
You doggie!
Thanks mate didn’t even watch the video just used the team 😂
Hi Andy - what’s the code for the keys talk football league?
Harry kane supporters  👇
What about Harry Kane ?
Alvarez at City could be a great pick up. Played in community shield too
Andy do you have any concerns over picking 4 midfielders all at the same price point? I feel like this could limit flexibility going forward.
keep an eye out for strakosha ... 4.0 priced and bound to get first team minutes with raya going to arsenal
Why is there no talk for saliba
Udogie 😂
Odegaard is overlooked a bit. I think he will be on fire the first few fixtures at least.
So template
Johnstone rotates really well with Forest as well, even if Henderson takes the shirt from Turner, Henderson at 4.5 isn't bad either...
So I’m leaning towards having Salah, but also keeping Martinelli in the team. I more or less have the team you show in the end, but martinelli and stones instead of Mbuemo and Mitoma which leaves me with no money in the bank. Thoughts please 🙏🏻
Is mbeumo even going to play?
Hyper template, but nobody can argue with the selections. :/
The last team with Pedro and Salah is my exact team currently, all 15 the same. Love the idea of doing Salah to Kane in GW3, wanted the flexibility to move to Kane if I needed to. Got FOMO about bruno, Martinelli and Watkins tho. Great content!
Stones or gabriel ?
I have pretty much the same team but I did do Watkins down to Jackson and then Pinnock to Stones. I feel Stones should be pretty nailed especially early on and they are obviously the best defence in the league. Jackson could explode even against Liverpool (as a LFC fan I hope not but we’ve leaked goals all pre season) and even WHU (A) I don’t see to be a bad fixture.
Great report! Why no mention of Mbeumo's injury? Any thoughts on trading him out for Mitoma or Eze for the first game?
Is sterling a good catch? Just 7m and will start?
Thanks Andy. In the team variation you don't recommend bringing in Mitoma for Fernandes instead and keeping Martinelli?
I'm going without Haaland. Is this FPL suicide?
what about kane?
Feel like im watching a repeat of last video no?
Hey what about harry kane instead of salah?
Jackson at 7.0 is just better than Watkins at 8.0 imo.
I've currently got: Ederson  Eustipinian Gabriel Mee Shaw  Saka Odegaard Fernandes Rashford  Watkins Haaland*  Areola Kluivert Baldock & Marvelous Nkamba.....anyt obvious changes I'm missing?
As soon as Jesus was out, Salah made sense to me. Pedro on pens was a bonus.
chukwuemeka +jackson or mubama + diaby + 0.5 in bank
Hi Andy, who if anyone is nailed at rb for man u? Is wan-bissaka a viable option to save on Shaw or Onana. Keep up the good work😊
Imagine 3 Arsenal vs 3 United in GW 4! 😂
This is actually a more balanced team than the template. I only regret that everyone is coming around to this idea.
@andy change Mitoma and Mubama to Jackson and a 4.5 MF
Salah and joao pedro with 1.5m in the bank to bring in jackson in gw3 if he looks a better forward option. Or considering wissa up front instead but not as good a gw1 fixture
Having a headache choosing between  (Salah Shaw Pickford) or (Rashford Trent Onana)
We Are Back!
If i press save can i them not switch?
Turner and Areola will be my keepers and I'll move one to Henderson if he moves to Forest.
100% you will go with Salah, it`s not even a doubt😄
Private league anyone?
Alex Moreno is my Estu replacement
Why double Utd..
Hi Andy, my midfield currently is saka, Bruno, rashford, mbueno and mitoma. What is your opinion of swapping out mitoma for eze? I keep on having a thought in my head to change either mitoma or mbuemo for eze. Something making me think I'm missing out with eze lol
Great video, Andy. I’ve gone Salah for now. And I have Udogie instead of a $4m defender. Salah as a sort of differential is too tempting right now.
Thoughts on Dalot?
No Liverpool players 😮
spurs is not the same with udogie-vandeven-romero-porro...
Cash / 4.5  &  Martinelli  or Chilwell  &  Mitoma / Eze / Diaby
How much is Udogie in the window? 😂
17:33 this is the team Andy and you know it.  Bruno, Martinelli, Watkins  Or Salah, Mitoma, Pedro
Chilwell, Bruno & Watkins Or Cash, Salah, Pedro ?
No Salah 😮😮😮
Cash & Salah or Chilwell & Bruno?
Similar team except  Mitoma for Mbeumo  & Baldock for Kaboré
seems like Kane is gonna stay, Would that be a good choice to buy him ?
What about Bundia..
Is Fernandes on penalties or is it Rashford? Whoever is on penalties is the better pick between the two. I know this video says it's Fernandes but is this confirmed?
Will you consider Kane in any draft if he stays? He’s had a class pre season
You doggy 😂  Full disclosure - I have no idea how to pronounce it, but surely that’s not right!
I have exactly that same team with salah in, but plus fernades when you go with a 4-4-2 formation 💪🏽
Triple United is bold.
Why is no one talking about Justin kluivert as a differential
I'm going Pickford and Turner. Had Leno and Pickford, but Turner does the same rotation for cheaper
In Salah draft, after doing Mitoma ➡️ 4.5 mid, you can easily upgrade def and play 4-4-2.. just a thought..
That my team tool has clouded your mind.  Guys like Alvarez are as locked as Martinelli but that tool gives Martinelli a huge score and Alvarez a small score dropping your team rank into the 80s.
I’ve gone ederson and ortega as keepers, expensive but it’s sure I’m getting a city keeper and stops me falling into pep roulette with haaland as well
Hi Andy! The last draft has been my team for the past week. I’m actually contemplating pickford to Areola and then 4.5m def to Ruben Dias/James.
I find it so funny how this guy makes the same exact videos again and again 😂
Dias or Stones ?
The Hub being so excited about Stones is crazy. He only got 23 more points than Chilwell - who barely played last season.   Stones also got less points than some Palace, Fulham, Spurs, Everton, Villa and Brentford defenders.
I think the double up in midfield with united is gonna be to your detriment, your united bias is kicking in
Is De Bruyne a safe starter this season u think?
Is foden still a good pick, had him in for a while as I figured he’d start at the beginning of the season but I’m starting to have my doubts.
Isn't mbuemo flagged????
Would you rather. Pickford and Fernandes with James on the bench. Or. Onana and Rashford with Botman on the bench. This is in a Mo salah and Haaland draft btw..
Turner is still showing as an arsenal player for me so I can't pick him as I already have three arsenal outfielders..... How come he's showing as Forest for you?
Oooooh!!!!STOP IT ANDY!!! Where is the talk about Salah coming from  I though we've all agreed that we will be going without Salah...😂😂😃
Mbuemo+eduard or eze+wissa
My team looks really similar to this
Mbeumo or Eze? Diaz, Jota or Foden? Martinelli or Odegaard? Rashford or Fernandes? Joao Pedro or Wissa? Any thoughts?
Pronounciation of Udogie is winding me up lol, its Udo-ji not U-doggy 🤦🏾‍♂️
Me thinking if I should swipe this team 🤪😉
Nobody talking about Mitrovic?
With Højlund out for a month and no clear striker, is Garnacho worth a punt as he’s the clear left wing replacement as Rashford will be playing down the middle
How can you have turner, gab, martinelli and saka???? That's 4 arsenal
4 players in and so far defence and GK is the same bench is different but I like having some value on the bench for the next few weeks
How about Luke Shaw, if you go for pickford instead of Onana? Highly owned but in the fpl-community people consider chilwell before Shaw. Today I prefer chilwell but given his past injuries he is a risk.
Is no one considering branthwaite of Everton at 4.0 for a sub player? Returned from psv on loan last year where he recieved massive praise, psv tried to resign him but couldnt afford evertons asking price of 25m, Been linked with man u and lpool, ive been watching everton preseason and he has been their best player hes a tower at the back 6 foot 4
Are you not worried about mbuemo’s injury??? 75% chance of playing? Great vid
Mbeumo says he has a dead leg and might be a doubt for GW1, do you think he needs to be replaced or is it a good idea to keep him?
Thoughts on Lewis Hall?
Chilwell definitely isn’t the worst pick against Liverpool considering the last 4 games they’ve played against eachother have ended 0-0
Great video , a lot of points that i hadnt considered im really digging that last salah haaland draft ❤
Raul jiminez is 5.5
Torres at 4.5?
Will joao pedro be a starter for brighton ?
We all know Salah will be in the final draft!
Going for expense picks like Salah and trent first as it’s easier to get rid of them than get them if they start well
Why not Mitoma instead of Mbeumo. Mitoma has better fixtures?
You have 4 arsenal players(
i have the exact same team right now except i have henry and baldock on my bench 🤣. (I am probably going to Maddison tho instead of martinelli)
bloody hel if west ham arent as strong this year we are going down
what about Douglas Luiz from Aston Villa? he looks good for me. Any 5.5 mil midfielder to go for instead?
i will try 3-4-3 ;  Onana ;  Rúben, Estupiñán, Gabriel ;   Rashford, Saka, Mitoma, Eze ;  Haaland, Kane, João Pedro!    Оn the bench: Turner, Colwill, Baldock, Chukwuemeka
ofcourse you'll end up with Salah again like always 😉
Just to clarify with Turner - Forest have confirmed the signing but he's not been moved from Arsenal to Forest in FPL yet. I just changed the graphic as if he had. He'll be moved before GW1 so don't panic.
Will you put your final nailed on team up
Still not feeling B.Fernandes. Mounts going to take up the space he would drift into moving forward and he'll end up dropping deeper to dictate play from there. I'm looking at a cheaper forward to partner Haaland and sticking with Salah (who loves a goal against Chelsea).
Wouldn’t that make it 4 Arsenal players? Seeing as Turner is still classified as an Arsenal player?
Why chilwell over james?
I'm am staying away from Chelsea defense right now. I think Colwill is first choice but with Disasi signed and Badiashile coming back from injury I am just not sure who will get the most starts.
Not long too go 🎉 that team needs a wildcard
shaw over chillwell for me
I've caved in and gone with Salah in a 343 with Watkins and JP up front 🤞
Isn't steele nailed on as starter?
You’re currently on 666 likes 😮
Why is Gabriel always talked about over Saliba? Am I missing something? I rate Saliba higher, is Gabriel more threatning on the other end of the pitch?
By GW3, Gvardiol could be a starter for Man City. Same price as Estupinan.
Turner gone through yet? 4 arsenal there?
I just can’t see Martinelli starting, especially after how good Trossard was in the final. I’ve got him in, especially at only a price point of 7m.
Thoughts on Foden / other Man City midfielders?
Congrats on 350 Andy, you helped me to top 100k 2 years ago in my first season, had an absolute shocker last year and gave up but excited to be back!!
i wanna kane so badly.
Turner still listed as an Arsenal player?!? Amazing video - Congrats to 350 k Andy :)
Thoughts on jota as a differential?
anyone else not think son is great value at 9m , his ceiling is huge and a big differential .
I want to brind Turner in, but he's still listed under Arsenal and seeing as I already have three other Arsenal players, it's not possible to get him now. Any chance they will update him before the season starts?
Chelsea  fans please help, is Chukwuemeka going to start while  nkunku is injured???
Come on Andy, I need someone to share the pain with me with a Salah draft & he’s your  🐐 after all! I’m going Johnstone, Stones, Fernandes & Eze rather than your Pickford, Colwill, Rashford & Mitoma though. Good luck & thanks for the great content as always!
why is nobody on Kane and we are talking about Salah?  He is still on Spurs and is rolling in preseason
rate my team Pickford Arnold estupiñane stones Gabriel Mitoma Saka rashford foden Bruno Haland
Why no one choose KDB in fantasy?
i think jackson and a 5.5mil defender such as stones is better than watkins and a 4.5mil defender
question here, why are you more certain of mbuemo (with a knock) over mitoma?
I don’t understand why people don’t have Trent he’s classed as a defender and he plays as a midfielder and he’s a bonus point magnet and he takes free kicks and corners and gets a clean sheet here and there
I have one simple question. Bruno or Odegaard?
Forget about it, Colwil will suffer a lot of rotation ... little bit risky when you have more 6 CB on squad (my opinon)
Andy + Salah name a more iconic duo?😂
Pickford, estupinan, gabriel, Chilwell, Rashford, Saka, Eze, Salah, Garnacho (trust), Haaland, Joao Pedro  Turner, Udogie, Baldock, Mubama  2mil in the bank to upgrade Garnacho/Eze after a few gameweeks
"What is going on everyone my name is Andy, welcome back to  another FPL video and this is my 35 711th  team selection for gameweek 1................"
Play Baldock gw4 Kabore gw5 (everton at home then fulham away) you would save the money or deploy it elsewhere
Andy which one would u go for? Salah + Maddison (0.5 bank) or Kane + Jota?
Udogie is not pronounced u-doggie😂
Why pickford, what about Johnstone also seems to rotate nicely and palace much better defence than Everton?
What are people’s thoughts on Solly March this year?
HELP!! Should i have trent, mbeumo and Jackson or Stones, martinelli and Watkins in a 3-4-3
Just worried about trossard coming on early in games for martinelli that puts me off
A 4-4-2 with salah,  Pickford Etsu-Gabriel-stones-colwill  Rashford-saka-mbuemo-salah Haaland-watkins  Bench turner-chukwuemka or anderson-kabore-mubama
I am on the samé boat for GW one. But diiff. benchmark. GL Andy..I do want to beat you this season!
About draft with Salah. I prefer switch Colwill, Mbeumo and Mitoma to Maddison, Shaw and Anderson and play 4-4-2 with Anderson on 1st bench slot. I really dont want to start without any FCL offensive player.
I don't think I've seen any drafts with Callum Wilson. They seem to have scored against everyone last season. Should we be sleeping on him?
My team, Steele, Gabriel, Estupinan and stones. Midfield: Rashford, Bruno, Saka, Mitoma and Eze. Haaland and Watkins up front. subs: Onana on bench first game, Gvardiol, Baldock and Mubama. GW rating 98%, Team rating 99% and Predicted points 68.2. £0.5m in the bank. Not bad for my first FPL if I say so myself.
how insane is going with salah + kane and removing haaland? its my first fpl season
Opinions on Robert Sanchez at 4.5 andy? Will he start?
What watkins over Jackson
Martinelli and watkins or salah and wissa?
i am confused between mbeumo and maddison and martinelli please help
My team is now boiling down to 0.5 million - leave it in the bank or small "upgrade" in defence or attack
Great analysis as always Andy
Thoughts on Shaw & Gusto? My defense is currently - Pickford, Shaw, Gabriel, Botman, Gusto & Stones. With Gusto & Botman on the bench.
Not having any Defs or Gks from City seems crazy to me...surely there's plenty of clean sheet potential there!?
Congrats, Andy. Fancy joining another FPL league anyone? Code is :  fj1mp3
😮350k🎉🎉
Mitoma instead of Mbeumo ???
Not that it’s bad but this is as template as it gets 🥱
What's Fantasy Football Hub never heard of it before!
Think ppl are sleeping on Chelsea....
Why are you so scared of Colwill alot of people seem to think he's pretty nailed. For the price he seems great
last draft is exactly my team except eze over mitoma 😂
What about fixtures of Kane?
Kane + March + Baldock Or Joao Pedro + Salah + Botman  Despite being hard on Kane all preseason I'm leaning towards the latter because it gives me botman and 0.5 in the bank. Salah is in great form, good fixtures, and I have martinelli to swap out later and upgrade joao Pedro if needed
Can i go for shaw instead of chillwell?
The average is about 6 common players among teams... template wise
350k before gw1! 🎉
Turner is still from arsenal not Nottingham when are they going to change it?
Is Trossard a viable option?
How do you have 4 Arsenal? The app is still saying Turner is at Arsenal?
Andy have you considered Schade as a differential. Could start up front and is 1m cheaper than mbeumo
Would it be mad to go with both Joao Pedro and Mubama? It frees up so much funds and allows for a very good draft with Salah. It also allows for 2 6.5m midfielders so I've now put Diaby in my draft so im not missing out on the villa attack by not having Watkins. Thoughts?
Why no one speak about steele??
Martinelli and rashford or Bruno and odegaard? (I already have saka)
I like Botman more than Pinnock as he rotates well with estu and gab and better defense. Also Thomas Frank said in preseason that he would rather win 3-2 than 1-0.
Andy gave in to the temptation 👑🇪🇬 Don’t blame you at all. By the way Johnson should rotate better with Turner don’t you think? 👽
Maguire to West Ham!
Im surprised u don’t want to go with Salah. U can get really good and balanced squad with him especially if u are not sure about Martinelli and Fernandes. I have this changes in my squad Onana>Johnstone Bruno>Salah Watkins>Joao Pedro Martinelli>Foden/Maddison
You can’t go with Martinelli.  There’s a good chance Trossard and Nkeitah start  Havertz might start on the 8
Andy do u play fpl draft and if yes, can u share info on how to play it
The closer we get to start of the season the more tempted I am to go for salah.
Stop met cheaten Evert xxx
Why don’t you sell onana and get steel and then sell Estupinan and get Luke shaw?
Does anyone play other leagues Fantasy? or Champions League Fantasy?
Videowe!
Trossard and Johnstone, Diaby and Onana or Maddison, Johnstone and Udogie is replaced by a second 4 mil defender? Love the videos !
How do you feel about a 4-3-3 formation with Jackson, Haaland and Joao Pedro up front so I can also get Salah and Trent?
Nice one Andy
