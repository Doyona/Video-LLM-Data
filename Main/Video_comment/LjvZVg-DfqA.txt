Hell yeah I get Joel miller Arthur Morgan and geralt of riva a lot from people so them being s tier is awesome now I don't feel so bad about how I look 😂😂
Makes sense Youtube is supporting this cuckholdry with their comments
The witcher 3 is the greatest game oat
"Luigi is not sexy"  That didn't age well
not a single one from dmc?
S tier video honestly
You forgot Bowsette
There should've been a 'Hit it and Quit it' category
The tiering and ranking are so random and chaotic. Love it. 😂👍
I always assumed the "Boyfriend" in these videos wasn't real. I thought it was a channel run by two girls.
If this video came out after bg3 was released, Astarion would've cleared
Toad laughing at all those characters getting ranked while he sits on Shelby’s lap. 🐐
Line piece fills your holes in the best ways when they show up, but isn't always available when you need them the most. Because of that, I would drop line piece from marriage tier to long term that didn't work tier, lol
Why was Lara Croft not ranked in this? FALSE ADVERTISING!
Trevor lol
What, no Garrus?
"How about this one: Master Chief"  "Ah--"  AD BREAK LOL
Waiting for the Astarion-only remake of this video 😆
Trevor!? It's always the quiet ones...
When you were leading into TP Link, I thought it was going to be Daddy Gannondorf from TOTK and I'm sad he didn't even get an honorable mention 😢
Yall are great!
I’m Commander Shepard and I disapprove of this message
No kiryu kazuma?
Matt where did you get that shirt?? Also, congrats!!
Where is Goro Majima?
DUDE DID JOEL DIRTY
I'm kinda disappointed there was no mention of Dante from Devil May Cry. He was actually ranked as the hottest video game character by AI
I choked on my burger when i saw Joel and her reaction😭😂
This is so cuck
I'm a Sagittarius 🥲
Need the uncensored version stat!
This is hilarious, god I love you guys
Existem muitas referências masculinas em videogames, às vezes ser sexy não significa atratividade e nem o desejo de um relacionamento.
Can we put Matt's editing in God Tier too!?
list is also Matt's not so low-key men he finds attractive especially ass out Luigi
Love the video you two newly weds. Hello fresh lost of plastic packets but should I be worried ordering them for 3 meals a day?
I miss someone from the DMC They didn't even fit in the honorable mentions
Ammmmm Ezio?!?!
No Devil May Cry Dante? What a shame!
shouldve added totk ganondorf too
This is uncomfortable to watch
Nearly spit out my drink on several occasions I love the comedy of this channel
Guys, about Joel, would you kindly? TLOU 2 is still a PS5 exclusive, PS5s have been difficult to get a hold of at all, let alone in Argentina where the peso to dollar ratio is close to 500. I've been trying to avoid as much shit as I could, did you have to use an image from probably the most important part of the game?
Are you going to rename the channel wifey reviews?
Shelby do I still have a chance?  I’m great at Tetris
The master chief review reminds me of a comic. Husband is waiting while wife says from the bathroom "ready"? She comes out in zero suit samus cosplay. Husband: ".... that's the wrong suit..."
You forgot the great and mighty poo
I can't believe Wario's butt isn't here 💔
A short term relationship one would of been cool too
That line piece edit into Shelby’s mouth made me cackle
Theyre afraid to even mention Harry Potter now lol, meanwhile the people who were giving them shit have all pirated the game and are eagerly looking forward to the new HBO series by now
I feel like this list is going to change A LOT after Matt plays FFXVI.
Slippery slope...
The monster inc. reference haha
The add placement at 7:55 is goated
Leon Kennedy is literally my favourite character to ever exist
SHELBY - can you tell me where you got your glasses / frames?? I love them!
"leon is so sweet"  cut to leon throwing ashley off the jetski
You forgot DANTE from Devil May Cry 🤩
You're so cool together
GOAT!
You guys still cutting up in lines?
8:14 "Armored stoic protagonists" forgot about Samus smh
what's the name of the song in the background when mr mime appeared??
Video too horny
I love that they can laugh about the harry potter incident now 😂 we love our mature king and queen
Chill, you can talk about Harry Potter.
No Cloud Strife???
Heyyy u guuuuyyyss! 👋 where I iz???
Lots of good picks. Hard to choose.
cant believe there are no jojo characters
How’s the TOTK video coming!!!!??????!!!!!?????
This is a master class of segues
Are you SERIOUSLY this late in dropping a TOTK hour long gf review?  How is this a thing.  50 points from gryffindor!
Cant wait for that tears of the kingdom review
Congrats guys i wish u a happy marrige.
Missed out on some Devil May Cry
where is Zelda Tears of the Kingdom?!
wait we cant even talk about harry potter now? - i get the issues with hogwarts legacy's release, but can people just get over it
I could listen to you guys talk about this for six hours straight. Please do an extended version XD
WHAT ABOUT CHRIS DADDY REDFIELD????
Are they still doing videos?
Not one of the Snakes?? C’mon Metal Gear is iconic
Congratulations Shelby and Matt! You are almost there! Have fun at your wedding 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
You guy's really do hate Joel lol
Where is the presentation? 😂😂😂
Play Star Wars squadrons, please
HOW COULD SHE NOT NAME CAPTAIN TITUS WHEN TALKING ABOUT STOIC, ARMORED PROTAGONISTS!??  Just kidding, great video, I nearly died of laughter :D.
so wife reviews now  no more girlfriend ???
TEARS OF THE KINGDOM???????
Yo, Bloodborne?
Got dang, no kirbo
Tears of the kingdom when???
6:41 I love that the Tetris piece that everyone is waiting for is only 4 squares long the perfect size.
Hopefully you two are spending your honeymoon climbing and falling off the hills and sky islands of Hyrule on crazy cockamamie contraptions
On your honeymoon, y’all should play Gollum…
You missed a silent armored protagonist: Gordon Freeman.
@8:51 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can't wait for this channel to be called "The Wife Reviews" 🤭
Surprised Johnny Silverhand isnt on there.  I mean come on its keanu reeves
So, is this the last 'Girlfriend' Reviews? Are we calling it Wifey Reviews from now on?
Great choices, but it begs the question: have you guys played the Mass Effect games?🤔
Lucky man! 😮‍💨
Please try to do a review of sniper elite game or the strange brigade please you will not regret it
You guys should do Banjo Kazooie & Donkey Kong 64!! Two of my all time favorite games from my childhood.
As a heterosexual man.... Geralt... all day
Y’all should review the Mass Effect games :D
Please make a girlfriend reviews on outer wilds, its the only thing i need rn
Fun and spicy GF reviews are my favorite!
Now that Star Wars Jedi Survivor has launched, you two should do a video on it and see how it compares to Fallen Order.
Congrats Matt and Shelby
They didn't say Arthur Morgan cause it would be too much truth to bear
Wow you are getting married! All my felicitations, I just discovered this channel last week but you do great
Shelby sounds extra Ash Ketchum-y this whole video and I cannot unhear it.
Everyone is waiting for a Zelda Tears of the Kingdom video ❤😂
Its disgusting that you would support the molestation of children. I guess it shouldnt be a shock based off how you guys look
dawg how you gonna add Captain Falcon onto your thumbnail and not even put him on your list???
When r u guys going to play Hi-fi rush
Have you guys played Nier Replicant ?
that sonic and peach will live with me forever...christ
@7:52 Master Cheeks!
WHAT Girl freind reveiw  Is evolving  is now wife reveiws❤🎉😂 so happy for you two
No love for my boi Jinpachi!???
Did they buy this format at the Buzzfeed fire sale?
I get the TLOU “fans” did you dirty but you gotta stop spoiling the second game in otherwise unrelated videos.
He sure be a cuck but its alright that make the couple spicy
I’d like to thank Matt for sacrificing his search history for this video
5:43 NOOOOOOOOOOOO SONIC IS FIFTEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lol. Master Cheeks got rejected hard.
I'm so thankful to have been invited to this Bachelorette Party. I had a great time.
Is the channel name changing to Wife reviews? Love you guys ❤
That Joel picture made me cackle. Well done! 😂  And good thinking, getting Leon out of the way first. Talk about a Grade A dream hunk, god damn. 🔥🔥🔥 So gorgeous.  Awesome video, lol. You guys are great.
Have you ever thought about back sitting and reviewing katana zero?
I have to watch this in snippets so I can make it last.
The PS1 Hagrid made me spit out my coffee.
Wait so this Wife Reviews now? don't roll off the tongue well but it must be done lol
No SOLID snake ;)
In case it is not obvious, Matt will NOT be ranking the hotness of female videogame characters 🙈
I just realized I really want a game that features Doom Guy, Masterchief, Samus Aran and Duke Nukem. The four player co-op would be insane. Not to mention the plot!
No Kazama Kiryu? C'mon
I just like how the soon to be husband is put in the "S Tier" & not the God Tier😂😂 Well, until the next vid....Congrats on the wedding & take care. 😊
It's a shame after all this work that they're going to have to destroy this channel completely and start again!  Can't be Girlfriend Reviews without a girlfriend!😂
Is the channel going to become Wife Reviews?
Your reviews were good once. Fun videos which made me laugh. I started watching your twitch for Jedi survivor and Hogwarts legacy. I'm sorry but I think my opinions differ from yours a lot. So all the best you guys and I wish you a happy married life.  Good bye GF reviews.
Shelby came up with some excellent honorable mentions.
Congratulations 🎉
Would love a part 2 of this!
lmao, shouldn't Kratos also go in God Tier?
I am so honored to be a part of this Bachelorette party ❤  Congrats to you both
Congrats, you two!
I wish all other Guys you Show at 00:40 also were in ranking. you only put 3 out of 16 you show there I mean Isaacs Clark, Ezio Auditore, Batman, Corvo Attano and Bayonetta defiantly deserve to be on that list. For Ezio the old wise version from AC2R is marriage material, and younger one form original AC2 is long term but didn't work.
King Zora got all the gamer gals frothing
Left out Samus for stoic people in armor SAD
i cant believe the line piece from tetris didnt go in LONG term relationship but didnt work out
Commiserations
Congratulations, you two. I wish you a fantastic wedding and an even better life together.
Genuinely hilarious video from front to back, I spat out my drink at the picture of Joel and Shelby's reaction
bro look like baldur
How long does it take king Zora to move?       A week
Alistair from Dragon Age I
re8 vr
I like to think Shelby always smacks Matt with a Toad plush every time she gets hungry.
Matt putting out the quality content
The fact Prince Sidon is not in this list is a war crime.
After uou guys marry, will this channel be renamed to "Wife reviews"?
Yes! I bless this union! Thanks for the hilarious video and congratulations to you both!!
XD
I'm sorry, Shelby, but Line Piece is not marriage material at all.   You spend your entire Tetris life shaping yourself around receiving the Line Piece, but he never comes. You'll have four-stacks, and eight-stacks, and then because he never comes when you need him to, you have to either settle for a lesser two-line or three-line clear, or clutter your life with the other pieces, waiting for the Line Piece. And he only comes when it's most inconvenient for you.
Although the tongue thing is kinda weird, I also admit Ghirahim has a something. I was straight before playing Hyrule Warriors (where I met him), that's all I can say.
"Luigi is not sexy."  Alright, unsubscribed. I just cannot bear this anymore. Preposterous.
Not only the hottest but also funniest video ever. I couldn't stop laughing at some of Matt's choices.  Congrats again on your marriage, I can't wait to see al the pictures and videos
Genius Idea. Congrats to you both! I know in my friend circle there would be a large Garrus from Mass Effect vote.
Congrats on your degenerate khazar waifu bro
Congrats. Wish you a happy wedding.
Minute 10+. What would she do with those honourable mentions.   She would do....  Inappropriate guys ...
it feels bad to point this out but looking at the boyfriend and then looking at the top ranked guys; i don't think it's going to work out long term. the taste trend also leads me to believe that she **was** on the pill when they started dating but now isn't.
This video is how i found this channel. Boy, ive been missing out! Now binging past videos.  Anyway, i wish they had an archive of their twitch streams! Having just found them, i wish i could see them play through both TLoU games but twitch dont have them anymore. Any chance they decide to move their streams to YouTube?
You really needed a category for "Hot Weekend Fling, but not long-term".
Shoulda included dante bruh 💀💀💀
Well damn. Good luck to ya Shelby
Guys congrats, video was awesome
Snake, snake, snaaakeeee
I hope Shelby won't be recast, just find a new name for the channel :)
No one:  Me: SHEPARD
omg this is CUTEEEEEEE
Loved this, as always. Tho wer is the cast from animal crossing!
I make my wife watch your videos even though she has no context and doesn’t care.
guys you forgot king of cockiness... Dante
MIssed Kiryu and Majima my guy
My wife’s due date for our kid is in a month. Welp, I guess that’s just gonna have to wait until I’m done crying at the beautiful union of Shelby and Joel…..er, I mean Matt
You guys should revisit Returnal, it has coop now. My wife and I have really enjoyed it.
LeanBeefPatty got a gaming channel?
NTR we accept you one of us, NTR we accept you one of us hahahahhahah
"Girlfriend Reviews" is coming to a close. 😞 That being said remember to subscribe to Shelby's new channel "Wife Reviews." 😂
Um Alex from Stardew Valley?
The Tetris part dropping into Shelby’s open mouth ended me.
I know it's silly and most of us already know about it, but probably should've avoided spoiling the Last of Us. Especially with season 2 of the show coming
This channel needs more GF and less of whatever his name is (swapmeet Eric Voss)
Do you think you'll do a Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores review?
Luigi is very sexy miss 😂
hi shelby
links to all the blurred images? you know, for science
Congratulations on the wedding Wish u a very blessed wedding
What is the shirt Matt is wearing? I'm trying to find it
Can we get Matt’s opinion on the same list
Solid Snake, Canderous Ordo, Ezio, Allistair (Dragonage), Garrus Vakarian.
How can any guy compete against the hotness of Line-Piece Tetris Block?
Congratulations you two! Are you going to change the name of the channel? 'Girlfriend Reviews' is a pretty valuable brand now
Incredible Cuck behaviour. Truly Stupendous 💯💯
What about Raiden!!!???
I'd have thrown Jehuty from Zone of the Enders in there...With it's "cockpit" and all.
Is the girlfriend riffing on og  ashley's haircut ?
not the hagrid— 😂
Show some love for Trevor ❤
n1
Should have thrown Krew from jack 2 into the mix 😂
She looks like leanbeefpatty but without muscles
Im glad to see she looks exactly like she sounds. And congrats on marriage.
You forgot "ALUCARD AND DRACULA" from castlevania symphony of the night version
Just Squarsh Me!
KK Slider must be a sagittarius
Imagine not doing Solid Snake, Duke Nukem, or John Madden from 1988 John Madden Football.
"PS1 Hagrid"...THEN SHE HESITATES!!
Where is WARIO!
Kratos is too big and too fatherly? If she was Greek, Kratos would've banged her already because...well...just play GOW 1-3. You people know why...
Congratulations on your marriage!! You both are a match made in heaven! To many 🎉beautiful years together!!!!!
This guy looks and sounds like exactly the type of guy who wants to be cucked by his own woman.
including animal crossing characters, that's smart lol
Bashed-in-head Joel is obviously the winner here
Master Cheeks
You forgot Batman from the Arkham games :0
Parappa the Rapper
beautiful
I just realized this but Shelby looks like Lean beef Patty
Congrats guys!! 🍻🍻
Stoic armored protagonist face off WITHOUT Samus Aran?!!! HERESY
Where is dante?
I feel like this shoulda been fk marry kill
Watched to make sure Arthur Morgan got a top spot, stayed because you two are fricken adorable. Congrats on the upcoming wedding!
"I forgot we weren't supposed to talk about Harry Potter"  Lmao, I love it.
TREVOR FROM GTA?! no no no
No characters from the mASS Effect franchise? I am disappoint.
TRAVOR!!!!! Marriage Material!!!!❤
WHERE WAS DAGOTH UR?????
I’m so happy for you guys!
No Dr. Darling, really?!
This is your best episode by far
congrats! hope the party gonna be awesome and filled with happiness ^^ sooo... the channel gonna be changed into wife review?
The Tetris piece going in her mouth never failed to crack me up lol...
I literally look like Kratos. RIP
No Dante from DMC?!
This mean you gotta change the channel name to Wifefriend Reviews?
Muy girlfriend said she would cheat on me with Joseph seed farcry 5 and maybe aloy horizon forbidden west hahaha
PS1 Hagrid deserved better
Is girlfriend reviews changing its name to wife reviews?
I can’t believe that Arthur Morgan and Geralt bathing were on the list  but not my boy Jin Sakai bathing in the hot springs
Never been jealous of the boyfriend till she mentioned King Dedede and Trevor from her personal smash list. When they ask if there will be any objections to their holy matrimony I'm there. Call me 🤙🏽
Honorable mentions - top tier selection.
A month? I still got time to interrupt the wedding!
The way that you make her laugh gives me dopamine :) <3
😂😂😂😂
no Big Boss or Solid Snake? smh
Will the channel title change after marriage?
Great vid! congrats again!
wife reviews may not have the same ring, but congratulations anyways
This was one of the funniest and creative videos I've seen in a while. I added it to a couple of my playlists. Thanks!
I really hope Carlos from Resident Evil 3 Remake is in this! *watches
What about the king of all cosmos?
Love the bisexual lighting
Those tacos look so good, I almost forgot about the Sonic/Peach incident
omg i'm crying 😂 "jigglypuff in a sunhat" caught me off guard but freakin' King Zora just SENT ME
It goes without saying that we're now waiting for the "Boyfriend reviews" ver.
Love you guys! So cool. Best of luck
Watching this on the bus didn't work out great for me due to all the sexyness. Missed my stop. Missed my next stop. I am now far away from home. Can't leave my seat. Elderly is hitting me with a cane because I won't get up and give her my seat. The driver is getting involved. It's between letting them see my huge erection or standing (or rather sitting) my ground. Ok, last update... They arrested me for public indecency and I am now on a list.
Big Boss isn't on here. I vote for Girlfriend/wife reviews to tackle the entire Metal Gear franchise next plz
Okay but Im mad, where the heck is Garrus Vakarian?! Known hot boy that is absolutely strewn everywhere in all hot boy list
The audio profile sounds very podcast radio-ey, but in a bad way. don't like it. Please change it!!
Guys. Can you post the censored images somewhere? For science!
I'm beginning to question the seriousness of this ranking, after having seen the tetris block be marriage material. Clearly it's just an object of attraction.
this was hilarious!  needed this after a long week, especially the Hargid drop 🤣
now do a vid on the hottest Hogwarts legacy characters... ill wait 🍿 🍿 🍿
This might be my favorite video you guys have ever done 😂
How the hell did she land a hot guy like that?!
Gotta flip this arround now and expose matts kinks make him do a tier list too 😂
I wondering if the channel will be rename to *Wife Reviews* after their marriage.
This was amazing, love your humor matt!
Matt do the same!
I would have included Jin Sakai and his backside at a hot spring.
where's the tears of the kingdom final trailer reaction review ?
Master Chief? more like Master Cheeks
No Kiryu? Guys...
After a month we will see a new channel named , Wife Reviews 😂 . I am really happy for Matt and Shelby ...
"Wife Reviews" incoming
What if they broke up like 2 years ago and it became ex reviews
Where are ezio and shepard
Dang, can't believe Shelby is going to be recast in less than a month after she is no longer girlfriend.
How did you leave out Samus Aran!?!?
I hope one day they play the 1st kingdom hearts.
She has excellent taste. I mean it. Congrats in advance you two.
What's the name of the character from Persona 5?
So is this channel going to transition to Wife Reviews?
Commander Shepherd is disappointed
What the hell am I’m watching?   “I should stop smoking that ZAZA”
Yo yo yo Stardew Valley board game on display??? That’s a great game!
I aint gey but why is Vergil Not on the List?????????
I started this video thinking "Arthur and Geralt in bath tubs will be featured."  Great minds.
Samus beats doomguy and master chief in that category
what about Dante and Trevor Belmont?
4:35 killed me😂
He is SO Sagittarius, Shelby. Spot on
This video is very very concerning
Okay, hear me out, this is going to cause a lot of controversy but bouldy is mid at best.
Nathan Drake is a capricorn
With hades I if I could marry a voice I would marry Meg's voice.
How the hell Sexyroth is not marriage material?!
Damn no love for Waluigi?  Congrats and all but dang
+1 for inappropriate and horny video!  Congrats on the imminent nuptials, as well!
Where's Knack?
U guys are funny as shit, good shit
Now do it for matt
No Snake from MGS?
the samus erasure from armored protags smh
This video is IMPOSSIBLE to not laugh at.
grats on getting married!
no more gf reviews,  wife reviews
Umm Snake? Marcus Fenix?
Cursed Sonic and Cat Peach 😂
...sir we were promised Captain Falcon and you did NOT deliver.
Shelby is dead on about those sagittarius vibes
I wanna see the peach and sonic pic
the joel pic was so toxic lmao
No Dante from Devil May Cry? Fake tier list.
I was FULLY expecting the joke one for the bathtub thing to be Bowser at the end of Sunshine. Yours was so much better.
I always wish these videos were like half an hour long.
Wait, y'all getting married!?!? Is channel being renamed Wife Reviews 😂
The best vibes
The s in leon s kennedy  stands for s tier
Nice jizz shirt. 🎶
Mistress reviews comming?
Tetris line piece is definitely husband material but I would probably end up cheating on him with T piece. The way he spins into all of those impossible to reach positions...the tactfulness...I would leave my wife and two kids broke and homeless to be with Tetris T piece  Also, if delta was on there in addition to a regular big daddy he would definitely be marriage material
I'm going to get you a ground beef chopper for your wedding.
Only GF reviews can create wholesome, yet graphic, content like this.
Why no Leon S Kennedy?
What the hell...   where's Dante??
The fact that Solid Snake was not on this list is deeply upsetting..
Why cant talk bout Harry Potter?
Dante.... from devil may cry.
As a Sagittarius, I am hurt Shelby. How dare you.
So you gonna change the name to wife reviews?
Really surprised they left off solid snake lol
No toad?
Please do this with Matt!
Love this couple Matt is so funny 😂
You can’t talk about Harry Potter anymore huh…?
6:31 glad to know I’m not the only one who says this every time my GF brings up zodiac stuff 😂
What’s with the channel still being called girlfriend? Also the title - isn’t she your fiancé not girlfriend…?
How was Donkey Kong not included here?
No solid snake!? 😢 😂
Where was Garrus Vakarian?
This is Ezio Auditore erasure. How can you leave out the hottest of them all? The smoldering, the mystery, the ACCENT
Why? Shouldn't she be busy changing diapers?
I thought the line piece was xanax
I could watch hours of this.
How come no Kiryu taking a shower?
WAIT, NO MENTION TO ZS/SAMUS???
the only problem I have with Hello Fresh is that they don't include Cheese Tax in the portions
TREVOR???
luigi is the bluepring of sexy men... L take
Congratulations to you both!
Love it 😂😂😂 P.S. Please be nice to Jedi Survivor
I'm scared to ask what was in the Sonic and Peach picture
DO A REVIEW OF HARRY POTTER HOGGWARTS LEGACY!!! IT'S SUCH A GOOD GAME!:)
cuk activities.
Jin Sakai…hot springs version.
11:48 THE CHEESE TAX THE CHEESE  TAX
King Zora role play killed me. 😂
My wife just went "yup" along the whoooole video so cheers for that 😂
Learning that I really need to play Hades
Ooh! OOH! I know how to keep the girlfriend in Girlfriend Reviews!   Shelby, get one of your friends-who-is-also-a-girl (possibly a gamer herself😇) to join the channel and play the games while you review them! It will be like the early days of The View! 🤩  Just be cautious about how many “girlfriends” you bring in. With Matt involved, you don’t want things to devolve into Derry Girls. 🤪
Best of luck to you two
Hahahahahahahaha 8:49
No solid snake?
shark prince guy from BotW was missing
Waddabout Solid Snake
9:25 Bro chill out 😂😂. She was legit embarrassed.
Will you change your channel "Girlfriend Reviews" to "Fiancé/Wife Reviews" ?
“That’s make-believe nonsense” 😂
Well, this video was sweet and adorable. Five jigglypuffs with sun hats out of five.
are you guys gonna change your youtube channel name once you  got married?
It will still be Girlfriend Reviews, but the twist is that it will be Shelby's girlfriend
I still feel Uncle from RDR should have been included!
Girlfriend reviews new girlfriend casting.
Please makes a tier for Hades characters individually
Congrats on the marriage! Its about time!
Ah yes, the artists of Hades were very successful with their intentions. The beauty of Hades characters came from the fact that Greek statues and the myriad depictions of the mythical characters are always pretty, so the artists made Hades characters as gorgeous as possible, wherever and whenever possible.  P.S. King Zora instead of Sidon?! Freakin’ trolls you memeing castards! 😂😂
Why do white guys have "my girlfriend" reviews or reactions  BE A MAN and stop being a beta simp dude
Ezio?? He had a tub scene !
You missed that guy from The Forest 2 . omg . Derek?
What did I just watch?
We need a flipped around version now🙌🏼😂 bachelor party edition
I thought y'all already got married during the Hawaii trip?
the pictures that matt picked out lol 😆also congrats you two, almost time for your special day
Cast of SEKIRO!
This was a fun video
Balthier from ffxii, and Luxord from kingdom hearts can get it!
I'm just gonna say it without even watching it the witcher
Yo that line piece is pretty 🔥 though
❌ Girlfriend review ✅ Wife review
now that you two are getting married (Congrats Btw), let's see a crossover with @Razbuten and the lady he lives with!
Wait, are they going to change the channel to wife reviews
Congrats with the upcoming marriage ❤🎉❤🎉😊
thank you for this video, i was laugh crying! 🤣
WHERE IS DANTE????
~ 5:30 I liked
Now do the dude version without being cancelled
This video made me laugh. Good job! Mazel tov to you both!
You gotta pay the cheese tax
Mara got shafted
I WISH YOU GUYS A HAPPY MARRIAGE!!!!
Also, will the channel change it's name for Wife Review?
How's Kazuma Kiryu not in the list???
2:42 (flashbacks to the concept art and lore) 🤢   Yeah that’s a “I will help you end your suffering” tier for me
Heckin cute
Lederhosen Luigi deserves the S-tier.
what about the knight from 'hollow knight'?
your the bestttttttt!!!!! 1+1=3
6:38 hilarious edit
You missed Travis Touchdown
I completely forgot about giant penis from Persona 5.
Shelby is the marriage material.
Luigi shoud be in god tier
what i learned from this video: the gf review really likes  muscle men emoboy band  faces.
My personal marriage material is of corse…. Garrus Vakarian…. and i am sure Shelby would get it
Lol this was great. Congrats on your upcoming nuptials
Shelby has range.
Hey guys, congratulations! Just a slight issue with the audio on this vid, can hear a buzzing in the right channel
Time for the inverse, where Matt also ranks hotties.
Whats the name of the soundtrack at 4:16
Hottest video game characters?  We gotta put Lara Croft (OG not the new one) as also one of the original icons of gaming.  Then we got Liara T'soni and Tali'Zorah from Mass Effect. You may not see Tali's face, but those hips don't lie.  If we're talking about RE girls, you can't ignore Ada Wong. Remember, you're wrong if it's not Wong. Chun Li has thighs that can kill...literally If you're okay with a girl who likes to bite, Mileena is still pretty damn hot, provided you don't take off the mask.  There's definitely more, but these are the ones that I rank as the top of the top of hotties.
Sephiroth, but no Cloud?
Now we need Matt to make a tier list of hottest video game characters!!
1:30 is a great meme template material. Matt with perfect proud shit eating grin and disgusted Shelby
Prince Sidon PRINCE SIDON❤❤❤❤
But why did you make THREE tacos?
We have a mold of that hand in our bedroom…… You heard it here first, Shelby pegs her man
I’m so confused right now😂  Congratulations on your upcoming wedding!
You guys are so natural, its a pleasure to watch. I even like watching the ad, you should get Matt to cook the Hello Fresh next time.
Sometimes inappropriate bachlorette party? Isn't that exactly how it should be? :D
Wife Reviews - can’t wait
Shiet, no ranking or honorable mention for Dagoth Ur? It must have slipped you're mind, because this is GOD TIER material1
Shelby doesn't pay proper cheese taxes smh
Congrats on becoming Wife Reviews
That Harry Potter reference... you two are too sweet for your own good.
10:27 Helpful advice for all you single guys! I did the king zora scootch as well and now we‘re married! works 100% all the time.
Congrats and also ❤ Jigglypuff in a sun hat!!!
I do not get the fuss for Leon... he's... completely average
Whats the Persona 5 thing? For research purposes.
Okay I know this is just a silly tier list, but I think I've never laughed out loud more to a youtube video.
If I hadn't just started playing Last of Us 2 I would have been very upset.
Yo, she had that list of honorable mentions ready to recite pretty quick. And yet aside from Ghirahim, none of those would've been expected...
Lol! The f&%k is wrong with being a Sagittarius?!
Is it gonna be called wife reviews now
Well.. thats one for history books. NEXT!
We needed dante here :D
congrats you two!  Can't wait for the rebrand to "Wife Reviews" lmao.  Seriously though, congratulations! :]
I lost it on Stonedigger Troll. Now it is only right that we get Matt to do a Bachelor list
Where is snake, you spend literally 5 games looking at his well defined 🍑
i was expecting Cody from It Takes Two.
Linda? How did you know I’m a beautiful woman
For me there should also have been Snake from metal gear solid and Carlos from re3.
You do realize you need to make one of these for Matt now, right?? 😂
That PS1 Hagrid 😂
Matt um, terrible choices of pics for Joel and Kratos. Come on man lol
Congrats
somethings off with the audio but i cant pinpoint what. congrats on getting married soon!
Doom guy: "Rip and tear" Her: "Sign me up"
Where's the Sonic and Catpeach image? Feel like Matt has a lot of competition.
I’ve been a fan for so long I feel I’m getting married to both of you too
This is the kind of content I’m subscribed for.
How did Bayonetta not make the list?!!!
Why aren't they supposed to talk about Harry Potter?
Can't believe that it's a month away from your wedding. Would love to see it ♥ .Congratulations to you both
damn this made me realize there's practically 0 black dudes in mc roles that we're supposed to find hot
I guess they will have to change their channel to Wife Reviews
Finally they are going to lose their virginity
Your videos never cease to make me laugh, I love your content and I'm so happy for your marriage, sending love ❤
What's the link to the Sonic the Hedgehog and Peach the Cat photo?
"Future Ex-Wife" Reviews....hmmm
“This is giving me sagittarius and I’m not about it .” I must have one of the most cursed Zodiac signs…
OK, putting the line piece in Shelby's mouth led to some cackling.
Come on. You can't compare armored stoic protagonists and not include Samus in the list!
Where is goro majima from Yakuza 0 on this list?????
This was too hilarious! Congratulations on your wedding! 🥳
advanced congrats!!!! finally the evolution to wifey reviews is upon us soon!!!! Then come wife and kiddos reviews bwaahhahahahaha!!!
So Shelby swallows long pieces.  No wonder Matt is marrying her.
I have never clicked so fast on a video so fast in my life. 10/10 content
Ok, fun time is over. I have to know the soundtrack name on 4:16! If you won't talk i'll put that one dislike button that'll lead you to dismarriage! From the ashes of world filled with sins i'll bring down apostles of hatred on thy doomed souls! The Flame of Purification will embrace thy foul thoughts and trampled morality! For your sake and forgiveness — give me the name!   P.S. Sorry for English. P.P.S. No hate. Have a good Day, sires and ladies. P.P.P.S. Please give us the name!..
No dante what
The hades characters are an ideal harem. Guys or girls
I love this video so much!
I'm gonna need to play Persona 5, for no reason.
why cant you talk about harry potter anymore?
Matt: Sonic and Peach in a bath together Me: what kind of fanfiction have you been reading???   Congrats on your upcoming marriage once again guys 🎉
Waluigi?
This video, honestly, made me laugh so much 😂
trevor from gta killed me. great mention shelby
Her: "I'm hungry"  Him: 😮
Holy shit someone has discovered the OTT preset on ableton...God dayum the audio is insane
Congrats you guys! You’re an adorable couple!
did they do a re-upload? i remember seeing a different thumbnail and title for this before going to bed last night
Jetstream Sam will always be hottest video game character imo
This was great and really cute
Girffriend reviews turned so slowly into MxR plays that we didn't even notice...
You know, if you two ever get divorced I think I'll lose all faith in all relationships forever
so will the channel's name change to Wife Reviews or?
This reminded me how Hades soundtrack is so damn good. What a great game, man.
Hottest Female Video Game Characters isn't worth doing.  Too easy. 3. Lara Croft 2. Tifa 1. Bayonetta
Dang, Shelby, Leave some Matt for the rest of us! Why you gotta take him off the market like that?! But fo real, super congrats for next month guys!!!
So my wife and I love your content, but she isn't really a gamer. So imagine my surprise when my wife (who loves TLoU show) sees the image of Beaten-to-death Joel... Guys!!!!
this video so cute. so wholesome.
Can we put Ps1 Hagrid ABOVE marriage material? Maybe soulmate?
Wow I can't believe King K Rool wasn't on here that's crazyyyyyy
HARRY POTTER?? *MANGLED JARGON* still love you ☺️
yall forgot dante vergil and nero from the dmc series 🤕
This is like my second favorite YouTube couple. Only after Henry and Jeannie
they really did my boy waluigi dirty this time
No love for everyone's favorite battle toad, Wrex?
If this was the other way around. There’s no way Matt can ignore Ivy from SoulCalibur. He would be whipped by her like he’s never been whipped b4.
The only man Shelby will hold on to longer than Matt is clearly Toad. I mean look at him. He’s adorable!
Something tells me that dirty Tetris joke was not something Shelby knew beforehand 😂
She would do Trevor???? Wow. Somewhere Trevor is half naked & drunk but rather happy….
Master Chief checking himself out naked like that clearly was a sign that he was wondering if Cortana was ready to peg him. The Chief was ready for it.
woke
Congratulations you two
Wait they're dating?!?  Jk, congrats!
Lee Chaolan is a ladies man & wants to join the list. “Excellent!”
So, channel become wife review? Lol
1:14 Wait is he throwing her into the ocean? lmao
Sooooo adorable. Omg, wow.
This video had me smiling and laughing the whole way
Nathan Drake is WAAAY too charismatic to be a Sagittarius. Source: am a Sagittarius.
I need a gf like this
This is one of the funniest vids y'all have ever made! Freaking relationship goals right there. Congrats guys!
This was just another way for Matt to flex on us again that he is indeed marrying Shelby and we are not. "Look at all these hot guys (and also you) that Shelby isn't marrying because she's marrying me" - Matt, probably.
Please make more horny videos thank you from Pakistan
I hope all the plans for the wedding are going well and you guys have a fantastic flawless day!!!
Can’t believe kiryu wasn’t on the list
I think a lot of foot- and leg-liking gen Y's were awakened when they saw the detailed polygonical magic that was King Zora's calves, ankles and heels in Ocarina of Time.
No Garrus??
Big WHAT from P5?
This was pure gold!
The Zelda Butt.
I hope Matt is next.
No Shepard from Mass Effect?
Girlfriend Reviews will soon be upgraded into Wife Reviews lol
I can't believe Dante didn't make the cut.
love you guys! all the best!!🎉
What no love for Rico from Just Cause?????  Who are you even??
You kids seem great together.  I hope you make it.
How could you not include Commander Shepard, with the face and body of Dutch underwear model Mark Vanderloo?
1:13 wasn't she complaining about this game before because of Ashley the real sexiest character in gaming lol
My Sagittarius self took that comment about Nathan Drake very personally and I'm crushed, probably because I'm a Sagitta-
"We can show that" - Bruce Green
*pushes up glasses* "umm, actually, big **** from persona 5 is not exclusive to 5.  Mara is a long running classic fan favorite going all the way back to the first megaten."
Solid Snake?!  Where does he go?
You guys are literally my favorite functioning lesbian couple!
Congrats!
Do this for girl game characters and get canceled. Lol
Wifey Reviews!!!
I would totally marry kratos
No Garrus Vakarian?!
Congratulations on the nuptials 🎉wish you guy the best
Wife Reviews incoming!
Wife reviews incoming 🎉🎉🎉
0:39 it’s a sin to put the Dante from DMC there instead of the real Dante
Congratulations amazing!
Good video but no Kiyru?!?!
Strangely enough, i find this presentation very compelling, smart, fun and funny. 😂 .congrats on the future of ex-girlfriend reviews!
You don't have to give up these hotties, if Matt is a true gamer hes into most of them too.
So hear me out here: Tifa
Bad ending: Ex-Girlfriend Reviews Good ending: Wife Reviews
That Captain Falcon stripper is going to feel so awkward when he sees he didn't even make the honorable mentions
I saw the video title and was 100% sure the DMC boys would be on the list but i guess they'll make an appearance another time.
Venom Snake. Connor from Detroit become  human. the cat from stray
Solid Snake not being in this list is a crime! 😂
Ok, what is that Persona 5 character?
you guys get a like on your makeshift monitor stand.
Dude the line from Tetris made me LOL
The edits are amaze as always - so fun to watch you two laughing together
Miithew!
There's something wrong with the list when you have too many in S tier.
super fun video 😂 happy wedding, you crazy kids~ 🎉
Oh my god that csi Vegas clip, that was my first introductions to furrys and I was 6 or 8 years old. I did not understand then and honestly don’t think I fully understand it now lol
After bathing Sonic always reads the newspaper
Love this channel. You are the two palest people on the planet. Smeagal would tell yall to get a tan.
4:17 how come this face of Mr. mine looked like Mr Mine 😂😂
Such a cute video idea. Lolz. 😂
Title of next tier list: which character would you let raise your children for a year
Where were all the mass effect characters? Garrus is in shambles
V from cyberpunk??? Either gender hah
😂 love it
Less than a month?!? Seriously? Wow, so happy for you both! Much love from México!.
Ok, I think you missed a grand opportunity to see if Shelby would like Commander Shepherd to dance at her hen night
I’m a heterosexual guy and I’ve always thought only about girls but damn is that Tetris block fine!
Line piece is not marriage material. He shows up, gives you momentary pleasure, and then disappears.
Rex from xenoblade chronicles 3: future redeemed. Actually, you could include most xenoblade characters there too.
This was genius 😂
Now I need the reverse of her doing this to him. This is amazing.
Matt's turn
I thought this was gonna be a Hottest Female Sonic characters kind of deal 🤣
Day 2 of asking when you're reviewing Hogwarts Legacy
Wife material⭕️ Maya fey (ace attorney) TESTAMENT (guilty gear)  S tier ⭕️ Aoko (Melty Blood/Tsukihime) -she’s like a less angry Baiken with magic powers. Red hair down to her butt, plays guitar. Emotionally unavailable. JACK-O (guilty gear) Aliph (even the ocean) Chizuru (KOF)  A tier⭕️ Baiken (GUILTY GEAR) -emotionally unavailable baddie Ichiban kasuga (like a dragon 7) -loyalty is so sexy Whip (KOF) A shorty widda whip 🌀duh. VICE & MATURE (KOF) -80s-era boss lady assassins 😮‍💨 Makoto (street fighter)  B tier⭕️ JURI (street fighter) -I simp for emotionally unavailable baddies IRL too 🫠 B Jenet (KOF) Shermie (KOF) KARA (NEET Girl date night) LINK in those fem clothes  -5 years ago I swore off twinks, but we could be a sneaky link lmao SEPHIROTH (FF7) -long hair evil sexy man AXL LOW (guilty gear) -long hair nice sexy man IBUKI (street fighter)  Orgy tier ⭕️ cast of hades  Yeah. It’s fair to say that getting into fighting games was brought about a moment of clarity: I’m living through my weeb arc 🤓
No Duke nukem?🤔
These make so much sense but especially the Hades cast ranking
i too think tetris xanax is marriage material
Where’s Garrus? 😂
Time for a rebranding of the channel
I need a Majima 😢
Majima and Kiryu should have swept
So the channel’s turning into Wife Reviews now? Cool! 😁Lol.
Was that Koramora?
I just honestly can’t believe how good her list of additional mentions was at the end just off the top of her head like that. Truly incredible
Congratulations!!!!!! I happy for you guys!!!!!
As a Sagittarius I don't think I will ever recover from this...
That butt crack chin though.....
SNAAAAAAAAAAKE?
No fish guy from Breath of the Wild?
If funky kong isnt a option its a crime
So great of Matt to show you this line of handsome and beautiful eyecandies. What a great guy! Happy for you both!
Joel....that's rough.😬
Very nice idea of bachelorette party! Congratz for your marriage and I wish you many happy years!
I love this couple very much, lol.
Leon Kennedy is the hottest
Damn the bachelor party version boutta be wild
How the heck was Toad not mentioned?! She was even holding a Toad plushie!
you two are so funny!
My wife and I (recently married) had so much fun with this one! We paused the video and add our own rankings — lot of overlapping taste 😆. Huge fans of the channel, congrats y’all on the marriage 🎉
Where's commander Shepard!?
Yo where’s Dante and Virgil at man
Congratulations on the upcoming marriage!
Matt is in the same league as Leon S Kennedy! they’re both “marriage material!”
congrats but comon dante and vergil?
Note to self: Shelby hates Sagittarius. Gee thx😂
Not the CSI episode 😂😂😂😂
Oh myyy, only if i could like this video 2nd time for this Hades cast placement, believe me i would.
Soon will come the final Girlfriend Review to usher in a new age.
This was the greatest, cutest thing yall. 😂😂😂😂 A perfect wedding ring out of 10
Matt picked some real winners here Especially Luigi
Joel Miller ... That's the only picture i could find of him 😂😂😂😂 this man went to the dark side so quick
Where is Soild Snake on the list?
Marriage? The same month as Zelda Tears of the Kingdom? This is cursed.
D'aww... you two are so cute. 😊 Congratulations, both of you!
Girlfriend Reviews ascended to “God Tier” with this video. There isn't enough space in this comment box for the superlatives.
: )
Using THAT image of Joel is certainly an idea...  Anyway. Congrats on the wedding!  2:21 LOL
Please... Uncensored version... LMAO
This video seriously confused me sexually
Hahahahah y’all are the best 😂😂❤
Glad we can all agree Link is hot
Never been so happy for 2 strangers to get married! The most wholesome couple on YouTube ❤️
Shelby did not honorably mention Sidon, best fish man. I am crushed.
But what about Toad?
PS1 Hagrid was awesome 😂😂
Now we need to see what wifey material is worthy of dating Matt 😮
I'm pretty sure I was promised a Captain falcon stripper at the end of this video and I am very disappointed 😂
WIFE REVIEWS!!! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Does that mean the channel need to rebrand to wifu review??
Nice to see another Dedede appreciator.
Another banger
I’m glad I’m not the only person who saw that penis-lookin enemy in persona and thought “it’s just cock and ball.” Like what else is it supposed to be? IT LOOKS SO PHALLIC.
This marriage is nerdier than when Steve Wozniak married Steve Jobs
Dusa should be in her own tier above God
What about... Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake!!!??
This was soooooooo cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuute!
No Kiryu or Majima?  Well, I suppose I wouldn't include them either if I wanted to keep my girlfriend...
I think I need to go make my funeral arrangements, because this video killed me. Y'all are frigging adorable.
I will never understand what girls always feel. They have to wear these giant bug eyeglasses they look so goofy
How is a 2 gonna rate hot 😮
Do this again, but with live action game adaptations.
Sorry to hear what happen to you guys, my condolences on the marriage, so sad to hear the news.
Lotta Street Fighter characters were missed. 😂 Congrats y’all!!!!🎉
Brace yourself for Wife Reviews!
Solid Snake snubbed!
Congratulations y’all!
Where are Solid Snake, Big Boss and Raiden?
The next video should be "My boyfriend ranks the hottest video game characters" for balance...       ... as all things should be.
Wow getting married🎉🎉.i guess channel name change is coming😂.
How is Snake not in here.  His names Snake.
Sephiroth is deffo an incel.
You forgot bt7274 >:(
I'm so distracted thinking Shelby looks like @leanbeefpatty if she wasn't buff.
Congrats to you both!! Are you going to be changing the channel name to “Wife Reviews”?
This was fuckin hilarious. I loved every bit of it
Matt, I'm equally offended and delighted you used that picture for Joel. I couldn't stop laughing.
I knew the first one was going to be Leon.
So the Captain Falcon stripper was a joke? Damn it. 😢
Can't believe flukemarm didn't make the cut :(
Commander Shepard  Well bang ok 👍
when that picture of father joel appeared on the screen, a million redditors suddenly dropped to the floor in anguish without knowing why
Who/What was that Persona 5 creature?
I don't think I can look at the line piece  from tetris the same ever again
Gunna have to rename the channel to "Wife Reviews"
I wonder if my Mii is still alive.
Loved the video, but come on, Matt. No Dante? No one from Devil May Cry at all? Impossible!
I hope Shelby has a real bachelorette party with her pals (whether it is strippers with sausage & lederhosen or bespoke scents & crotchet), and that the wedding / love party is fun, meaningful, and memorable in a good way.
Are we gonna get a Secretary w/ guns 3 review?
So that's what S in Leon S. Kennedy is for.  Okay, I'm gonna miss you Shelby for portraying the role of "girlfriend". Can't wait to see the new cast.
the hades cast getting their own tier is the only correct answer
I got a thing for catwoman, but also must mention a forgotten fox...Kate Archer
So she's got to make a list for him now, right? Peach, Bayonetta, Pokemon nurse, Mrs. Pacman, etc.
LeanBeefPatty is a gamer??
*BONK!*
HIlarious and great content LOL
What's the song from the ad read?
Dante wasnt on the options cause nobody else would then stand a chance
They're so cute together. Congrats on the marriage.
Pleass do this again but reverse the roles
It didn't work out between Sephiroth and Shelby because he stabbed her in the back. :)
What about Sidon from Breath of the Wild????? :P
Tifa. Hands down
Shelby is the alternate timeline LeanBeefPatty where she got into gaming hehe
Leon was a strong start, but I know for sure that King Zoro can finish strong ;)
GOOD THUMBNAIL CHOICES
What are you naming the baby?
It's literally impossible to play Ocarina of Time and not mimic King Zora when you get to that part where he shimmies across the ledge.
Matt was very wise to make the whole cast of Hades. Too much hotness to pick just one.
i'm really gonna miss shelby
How could you forget the sexiest, most bangable video game character ever created? I'm of course referring to Waluigi. SMH my head.
Matt wisely did not show his new bride to Mr Duke "Balls of Steel" Nukem. 😁  Thanks for the fun vid, and congrats to you both!
Shelby is surely getting an award for having the hottest videogame boyfriend (no homo)
That Joel edit was gold: "This is hard because, uhhh, S, marriage material." 😂
I can't believe you didn't include Solid Snake's Ass in this tier list.
When Shelby said she was, "gonna get Zodiac on you" about Nathan Drake, thought it was her roundabout way of meaning meant "cryptic", but oh well.
Is it just me or the audio was EXTREMELY sibilant?
Shelby if you decide to marry the line piece instead, I would like to marry Matt. Thank you.
No Chadasaurus Rex makes me sad
A list of "hottest video game characters" should really include everyone from Tekken and Soul Calibur...
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU GUYS BABY ANNOUNCEMENT WHEN THO?
no GARRUS? no RAIDEN FROM MGS? BOMBASTIC SIDE EYE
You two are perfect for each other. I was just wondering where the next video was and BAM, funniest upload so far. Happy wedding day!
How do I get a hold of the unedited version of this vid!! So funny!! Thank YOU!
the cackling from peach and sonic was hilarious! y'all are too much....fun video.
Tetris Long Block x2 🤣
What about Samus in the armoured stoic protagonist category?
I wish I could marry you both 😂 love you guys so much
Tingle!😅
Just going to throw it out there but what about Ezio from Assassins Creed?
The omission of solid snake infuriates me
Master cheeks
Congrats on your marriage!!!
Rebrand as Wifey Reviews?
7:19 Fun fact, this is the exact moment when it aired that I had to explain to my preacher father (with 40 years in the business) what a furry was.  The look on his face was worth the awkwardness.  He never looked at mascots the same way again.  13/10 would recommend.
Don’t go looking for the sonic and peach fan art. I didn’t find it, but I found a lot worse
"Trevor from GTA"-damn, you're more twisted than I thought.  Good luck, Matt
So is this gonna be a "Wife Review" from now on?
Will be Wife Reviews ,or we will miss you guys ?
Can I come to your wedding? Don’t need a plate and I’ll bring my own booze thanks!
Lol why change the thumbnail?
Did you just assume their genders?
PsOne Hagrid fans will never forgive this intransigence.
Matt set Shelby up with the classic "Sexy Bath, Sexy Bath, Sonic Bath"
Funny, cute, and super sweet 😸 Mazel Tov!!! 🎉🎉
I have two that I believe should have been included. 1.) The King of All Cosmos from Katamari? 2.) Going back to stoic protagonists in suits of armor that cover their faces...... Samus? I initially thought maybe this was only male characters but she did say Aphrodite was hot, and Big Mommy was also on the list.
6:39 tetris moment is just pure gold
Prince Sidon is sorely missed.
Looking forward to ex-girlfriend / first wife Shelby
Matt sharing his "algebra" folder content that he locked under a password for this very same reason...
THAT CSI DEEP CUT! Lived to see it referenced.
I Hope you revisit that Idea at some Point Because this list feels very incomplete
You guys are just both amazing
A lot more furry content here than I was expecting lmao
that sagittarius comment tho TT^TT (but ngl i agree as a sag myself)
Shelby, season your meat before cooking in the pan, leave it resting for some time, and when it is in room temperature cook it. It will make hello fresh meals even better 😉
No Dante and Virgil...
Do a video of the reverse
this is like an episode of "hot Ones" in many ways
what an amazing video, loved it!
Are you going to rename your channel to Wife Reviews now?
You go Shelby!
Okay, hold on now.  You were HOLDING Toad and didnt even give him an honorable mention?  Haha, no this was a hilarious and awesome video. Congrats and wishing you two the best and hope to see the new Wife Reviews channel soon! ❤
Shelby has great taste, that's not surprising
Do you guys still hate trans people or have you changed?
If they ever play the Judgement games, she's going to definitely add kaito and yagami to the list.
haram!
The channel should definitely get renamed to "Wife Reviews" when you get married. Wish you all the best 🎉
ya'll might end up spoiling the show for people on that joel shot lol
The entire Hades cast aka greek mythology. Absolutely not unless your into every type of abuse.
6:33 - Matt speaks the truth
No DMC chars?? Anyway, congratulations!
He looks like Ralphie from A Christmas Story
This list needs Solid Snake!!
I’m excited to start Hades today. I shall… draw myself a bath…
Ive Never noticed the massive bi4bi energy these two give off
You guys are adorable. 😁 Congrats on getting married soon! ♥
Solid Snake was too much to even be mentioned
This video was a lot of fun and I would love to see a tier list like this for the characters for Romancelvania
I was honestly waiting for Matt to take off that shirt and do a captain Falcon impersonation and strip lol
Shelby had to pay her dog the cheese tax. da rules are da rules
u need to get them tortillas toasty on a skillet right berfore serving. keep em warm with a big fabric napkin
Lmfao line piece just sneaking in
So it is "wife reviews" next? Good luck for your marriage.
I love everything about this. It's great just watching you two being silly and having a laugh.
Congrats! Love your videos and this one is just next level
As usual 100% correct answers from Shelby.
I would add Altair, Ezio, and Bayek
"we do not talk about Harry Potter on this channel". 🥺  I'm sorry about what happened Shelby. Hope you feel better.
Lol  All Playstation exclusives main characters are hot and not for me 😂😂😂😂❤
Conspiracy, Lean Beef Patty and Shelby are the same person.
Sooooo...... wife reviews?
Glad to see the Hades cast getting the attention they deserve
You guys missed batman
Nobodys gonna comment the "I like the hand size" thing? ok...
Mama nyx from hades is the hottest. Fight me
GOLD😂
Trevor from GTA is nasty 🤦‍♂️
Stonedigger troll? Now THAT is a lady of class.
bro how you gonna start with my boi leon, like do you WANT to get married?
Joel and Kratos are a little too old for me. Great guys though.  Too much dads, kinda deals a little bit of damage to their daddy status for someone who's not married and doesn't have kids like myself 🤣  If I were though, they'd totally both be daddies.
Why does he remind me so much of Paige Steele's boyfriend...?
Dante from Devil may cry.  Congratulations btw We were wondering when you guys would make it official
video is awesome, but why it is at least twise as loud as average youtube video?
Petition for Channel name Change: Wifey Reviews
Don't do this video for hottest girls. Your audience would cancel you.
Your fiance would marry literally anybody 😂❤
I hope we can see a marriage video! Happy for you both!
The sound for this seems messed  up for me. It's kinda tiny and thin, hurts my ears.
Congratulations to you both - this channel has been fantastic from the beginning, such talent game-skill wise, musically, editingly, and comedically.  All the best to you!
less funny than expected
I can't believe Luigi isn't S tier
Matt rethinks his life choices for 12 minutes and 22 seconds
hearing "big penis from persona 5" really remind me that we need a new proper SMT game
Loathsome dung eater snubbed
Uhh, Wife Reviews?  Is this currently Fiance Reviews??
8:49 I'm dying 😂😂
Congratulations 🎉, 🎊🎉🎊🎉
I knew Leon (our favorite himbo) would be first, but Tetris line block is my close #2. Like a stud of a superhero that swoops in to rescue you whenever you need them.
the shock and laughter that came from me after seeing sonic and peach like that
we need a new name for this channel, waifu reviews is defly on the table, or couple reviews?
10:20 Trevor from GTA is borderline concerning...
Wife Reviews
I love them so much it hurts
Can’t believe you made s tier marriage material and not Kobe beef 😢 1:29
Poor Jin Sakai and his hot tub butt
I love this!
New name for the channel: Waifu Reviews.
that tetris edit omg
This is the content we wanted.
Lolololololololol
Anyone else notice that this guy is kinda built like luigi?
I mean, I think she should've rated sonic and peach by themselves as well
The entire poll is invalidated by the absence of Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima.
This have been fun!
You two are so cute! Congratulations  on the upcoming wedding!
Recurring line piece jokes 10/10
I've got bad news for Shelby when it comes to Ghirahim
Man, I wish my gf could understand a ‘Down Smash’ joke.
Speaking of Harry Potter and horny - Professor Garlick.
Good to see Luigi getting the recognition he deserves
I'll be waiting for the Hottest Video Game Characters but for the BF
Finally getting married
God, Shelby's giggle is food for my soul!
Shelby ranking all the hotties, but Toad is the real one for being her constant companion through the ep.
I want to see that pic at 5:24
“That’s a putthatthingbackwhereitcamefromorsohelpme” I nearly spat out my chocolate mochi lmao
2:51 GIGAAAAA  DRRRRRRIL  BREAAAAAAK
Some of those pictures that were used lol😂😂🙌❤️💀. Great editing btw and Such a fun presentation. Congrats and wishing you guys all the best and so much love. Yeayy! lol😄😄❤️🙌🥳🥳🥰 Oww, oww, I got one to add. Where would you put Date on that list, from DMC?
Is she a Roy or a Ken girl?  I must know.
S-tier content.
oh, that 4x1 tetris block...
If I had a nickel for every time a bespectacled gamer girl who specialises in video production professed a fetishistic love for King Dede, I’d have two nickels.   Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice.   (It’s Shelby and A-chan)
Carlos from RE3 is hotter than Leon im9
Next do a smash or pass
This...was...adorable! ❤
Congratulations on your marriage!!
Waifu or Wife WHO?
Missed you guys (I know it’s only been 3 weeks but still)
Matt has super strong cuck energy. Amazing.
Congetulations my doods
there's waifu and then there's Why-fu?
No DANTE is an absolute CRIME BRUH CRIME
i need a hour long version of this video
11:41 What is that sweet baby's name and do THEY HAVE THEIR OWN INSTAGRAM?
I wanna see the boyfriend tier list next!!!
no samus?
8:04 what about Samus!
Arthur Morgan has tuberculosis. From an infection control standpoint, he automatically goes into the "get that away from me" tier until he is no longer contagious.
This needs to be a GOTY category. Geoff Keighley take notes
😂😂😂
Maximum WTF?! achieved!  *KILLER COMBO!!!*
soooooooooooooo the Channel will change name to Wife Reviews? =D
Hades cast is "S++ Would orgy daily"
Please, more goofy fun tier lists! This was such a fun video.
The evil chuckle from Matt right before he put sonic and peach up there gave me a sense of dread feeling which was IMMEDIATELY CONFIRMED by that accursed image
TV Master Chief is the best Master Chief because he’s actually had sex.
Metroid wasn't on the list, smh 😔
3:28 FKIJGJHFADSGHADSIJ WHEN I TELL YOU I DIED LOLLLLLLLL I NEVER SAW IT COMINGGGGG that was a brilliant play by Matt holy heck 🤣
What did Shelby do to put Joel out like that on the floor? Did he forget the safe word or something?
Wait so it wont be girlfriend  review  no more it work be wife review 😂 now
W
1:52 YOU TAKE THAT BACK!!
ya'll are so much fun 💘
No Dante though?
Shelby so fine. You wife her up Matt and Wife her up hard.
We need a link to the uncensored version of those censored pics 🤷🏻‍♂️
Why is Shelby so attractive in this video?
what about "Alexios" from AC Odyssey?? :0
9:26 That look lmao
He is more pale than white cheese 😅❤️ Btw love your shows
Why Mara?! WHY?!  I'm still traumatized from getting a Mara during a Fusion Accident. I'd gone through Persona 3 and 4 without ever having a Mara in my Compendium, and then along comes Persona 5 Royal to ruin that record.
I'd say all Greek gods from Hades are f*ckable material but stay away for long term
Fiancé*
Wife Reviews. Yay
The editing was *chef's kiss*
Congratulations to the both of you, wishing you all the best going forward.
Love the Harry Potter little diss lmaooo
Aww, they were able to crack a joke about HP. Perhaps wounds are starting to heal. Hope so.
You should toast those tortillas over open flame before serving they taste a lot better
wow i cant believe you guys didnt include vergil from dmc 5
This seems to be the end of Girlfriend Reviews    and the beginning of Wife Reviews, much shorter
I think matt is just running tests to try and be better then her S tier characters
If Hades cast wasn't in god tier I would riot.
shelby is so adorable 😭
Leon "S" Kennedy can only be in S Tier, we all know it.
1:17 - Matt's face upon realising he's up there with Leon S Kennedy
7:19 where is that from?
The picture of Joel you used is hilarious 😂
that down smash joke 0:23 *chef's kiss*  ...and if she didn't laugh at it you would've had to call the wedding off tbh.
That edit with the Tetris line piece was sheer perfection.
you made me laugh today :)
Shelby tryna marry more people than a Mormon
Lmaoooo im liking for “oops”
9:49 I was really hoping Shelby was gonna say "oops." haha
I love how Jewish Shelby’s mannerisms get in this. Shalom sister!
Congratulations
Nice
WOW..Best video in a while..LOL
you forgor the leper from darkest dungeon
#1 Marcus Kruber
"oops"
So, will you rename the channel Wife Reviews?
the Hades ranking is objectively correct
I'm surprised V from DMC5 isn't on here, that dude is a walking, talking pantie dropper
how can you make a hottest video game character ranking and leave out the hottest character of all waluigi
5:19 Yeah I paused the video to try and find that
¿Why they can't talk about Harry Potter anymore?
What was the Persona 5 character they rated?
I was expecting the peak of male performance in video games to show up, Kiryu Kazuma or Goro Majima
Ah… a spicy video 😂 love that we can be a part of this bachelorette 💅🏻
Best video yet guys.
you're next mister !!
This is only content i need
No Joel? :'(
I hope this doesn’t awaken anything in me
Sephiroth but neither Tifa nor Aerith? I am disappoint.
You guys are so fun! This has become probably my favorite video game channel!
amazing video! was dying after the tetris line piece edit
Its feel warming and kind of happy That you both are going to be married soon❤
Congratulations and God bless you guys. I hope you stay safe, happy, fortunate and unencumbered by the world around you. May you find more joy in life together than you already have and  don't forget to send me an invite to the wedding! 😂
This was hilarious. I hope you do one for your soon-to-be husband to rate.
come on man where is Dante??
no 2B😥
So the honeymoon will be Cat Shelby and Sonic Matt in a hot tub?
This is what I call quality content
Wanted to tell yall me and my wife treat your show like a good TV series. We always say we will wait to watch it till we can watch it together but SOMEONE just cant wait so they watch it twice.   That person is me. I'm sorry baby.
John Marston Red 2,all the girls FF7R, Zelda BOTW,Cloud FF7R. Who else?
I don't know what the hell this list was, but I like it.
Solid Snake??Ryu Hayabusha??Spongebob?Aloy??Conker?
Master Cheeks is where it’s at
Can we get those censored pics uploaded somewhere? I mean Sonic and Peach taking bubblebath. Dang, sing me up!
How DARE you forget crash bandicoot, sephiroth and Waluigi sir! i demand a part 2!
congratulations 😁
Big what from persona 5? I now needs to know!! :o
King Dedede? A-chan approves.
How about princess peach!
Hilarious episode. This was a great idea.
Nathan Drake looks like Steven Crowder and that's an immediate disqualification.
While I do agree with tier for the entire casting of Hades, I would say that Dusa is an angel and a 100% marriage material
I love that Shelby couldn't remember Ghirahim's name but Stonedigger Troll was an immediate pull from memory.
I'll admit it.  I was like...this is dumb.  And then watched the whole thing and laughed my ass off like a big fat dummy.  You win.  GG.  :D
Nah man, where's Dante!
I love that I came into thinking will we get to know Shelly's opinion on Trevor Phillips, and. YES. YES WE DID.
Technically "Hot, but not for me" are the type of guys women find most attractive
What? no Ezio ranking?! come on!!
No solid snake?  Heh heh snake.
Funniest video I've seen in a while
Yo, so in a month we'll start having "Wife reviews"?
Is this channel gonna be called Wife Reviews?
Why do i feel like Matt needs to clear his search history?
That Tetris stick joke was an s tier joke Matt. Good job
1:19 sorry shelby but chris redfield only have his sister for Leon
Big question is does Shelby like a bit of Solid Snake.
Dante and Vergil are missing
I can't wait for Wife Reviews
The title of this video should be “Matt just wanted to do something nice for Shelby and you can enjoy it too”
2:50  Matt: We have a mold of that hand in our bedroom Shelby: (in slowmo) nOoOoO
you forgot me though. rank me
Wife Reviews
what about the lady from control 2019? or the tomb raider chick, what's her name or captain Rex from lego star wars? you fellas have no culture
I appreciate the shout out to Jigglypuff in the sun hat, my Smash main is also a main smash.
The line piece going into Shelby's mouth! OMG lol
Is Daphne an English Setter?
Where's Dante?
The ultimate Girlfriend Review a Girlfriend Review of your wedding would be so fun to watch
can't believe my man Dante didn't even make it to the list
Yo that straight Tetris piece tho!
Much love for both of you! congrats on the soon to be marriage
Shelby is definitely marriage material
So one more month and then Fiancé Reviews will evolve once again.
6:37 loooool
That is Shelby's real laugh ladies and gentlemen
great video!!! You two had me dying but I survived.
Lets all be honest here. The only reason Sephiroth isn't higher on the tierlist is cos he's already in a committed relationship with Cloud
LMFAO Matt picking the best lineup possible for this very important celebration of their upcoming marriage.  This is honestly the funniest video on the channel so far
1:28 It's been THREE YEARS and whenever I see Joel like that, I still feel like it's too soon. 😂
dang it, wanted to show this video to my wife, but she doesn't know what happens to Joel x(
Where tf is King Dedede?!?!  Edit: Oh shit nvm 😆
Congrats on the upcoming nuptials!
Careful talking about Potter.Dont want the Twitter reich to come goose-stepping in here again
I expected the Mii character but not the way it looked 😂
Did NOT expect generic tired white guy/fiancé to be number 1
7:51 Master Cheeks
Gabriel Belmont was done dirty
She said so little yet so much about Nathan.
For real congrats for both of ya❤️❤️❤️
That "Sephiroth" sound bite 😂😂
Can't wait to see who's gonna be Matt's new girlfriend now
Wife reviews: ⏳️⏳️⏳️⏳️
Please post more vids 😢😢
The "oops" Hagrid killed me
Wheres Kaz
Is Shelby named after  a car?
Me, a Saggitarius: I never felt more attacked by Shelby than right now
Matt did Shelby so dirty with the Tetris block 😂😂
Is this just showing porn to my girlfriend?
Your content is gold.
Will there be a my Boyfriend ranking hottest video game character coming?
Wait, if you guys are going to marry, does that mean... that "GIRLFRIEND" reviews is OVER????!?!?!11!
6:39 I didn't know youtube allowed that...
I would marry Dante, Vergil is hot but not for me, and Nero is long term but it didn't work out
I'm surprised there isn't a "smash 'em and drop 'em" category between marriage material and LTR that didn't work out.
What is this redlettermedia set up
Came to see where Hades was placed. I was not disappointed
Hot and crispy pill bug for the happy couple  🎉🎉🎉  Mazel Tov
Jimmy Rings goes in the “Oops” category
Nooooo i was really hoping for Papyrus from Undetale, with a nice "bone" joke D:
Best part obviously at the end was Matt's King Zora impression, and I know you 100% do that on the bed. You don't just come up with that impression off the top.
Congrats you guys!!! This was hilarious
How are you going to splice clips from the office in to your wedding?
Congrats you two!  Hope you're wedding day is amazing!
My girlfriend would like to be a part of your bridal party since she says you're best friends and watches your videos for comfort. She would also like to add they you knit and she crochets and you both love Isabelle from Animal crossing and talk about her like shes a real life friend. P.S. Thanks for uploading and congrats on your marriage
She thinks everyone is marriage material. That explains a lot 🤔
Congrats y’all!
That's a quality I didn't know women were into.  The number and quality of attachments for my arm.
It is a crime that 2B wasn’t in this video
Lunar Princess Ranni?
Congrats on getting married! So does this mean the channel name is gonna change to Wife Reviews?
Can you guys do a video and review of the Stardew board game? Always looking forward to the next video!
Congratulations for a month's time!!!! Also love seeing the new upload.
shame you have to censor drawings
How could u forget the Queen of hotness, Bayonetta! 😭
i lold
Thumbs up before the video even starts
This is pure joy.
Congrats!!!
I piece of tetris is actually the one that everyone want but didn't get. They always have S and +
When they showed Joel, my mouth DROPPED
Hades cast hottest: Artemis and Nyx.  Don't disagree with me on this.
Trevor from GTA definitely has all the stds.
Wonder how much they laughted filming this!
Man I love you guys 😂
Love you guys !!! greetings from Colombia!!!
TOTK Ganondorf the only other god tier.
I'm actually heartbroken that Abigail from Stardew Valley isn't on the list
No Dante from Capcom's hit game series, Devil May Cry?!
if i subscribe to the patreon will i get the uncensored sonic and cat peach bathing photo
SNAAAKKKKKKEEEEE
This was such a good and funny idea, well done matth and shelb
1:28 I just love Shelby's smile turns into shock and almost like she was about to vomit when Matt shows daddy Joel's picture 😂😂😂
That was fun and cute.😂
it's gonna be wifey review soon i guess
Holy crap will you change the name of the channel to Wife reviews?
paid the cheese tax in the ad read, nice
I was hoping for Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn/Forbidden West to be in there.
What? Girlfriend Reviews is evolving!  Girlfriend Reviews evolved to Wife Reviews!
So is it gonna be wife reviews afterwards then?
Joel is so sexy that Matt HAD to use that specific picture, to give other characters a chance. The power Joel has!! Lol
Ok, now we gotta get Matt to rank the hottest video game women lol
Jill Valentine will always be the goat!
I want to see Matt’s sonic and cat peach drawing uncensored
Da queen and da king is back baby they neva miss
Matt you dingus. If you wanted to get strippers you should've gotten a Doom Slayer wearing nothing but a thong, helmet, and the blood of a billion demons.
So wife reviews soon?
I’m surprised Cloud Strife wasn’t mentioned
"Sagittarius... and I am not about it" Not the first time I've heard that 💀
Where was the captain falcon stripper...
👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Lmao the Sonic and Peach I had to show my boyfriend
Nice video
Amazing content
Hi boys
As someone who wishes every bachelor(ette) party came in the form of a horny TED talk this channel is once again a godsend.
Ima need a source for that Sonic and Peach fanart
STONEDIGGER TROLL 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Unrelated but my boy Matt is looking GOOD
Congratulations! Very happy for you two and your dogs!
Dante didn't even get an honorable mention?
Haven't you 2 been cameod in a game yet. You're sure to take the number one spot 😉
So is the channel name switching to Wife Reviews or...?
Can we come to the wedding👉🏼🥺👈🏼
Finals week is killing me. God bless y’all for making this
Congratulations, guys! Also, 2 minutes in, I'm going to be really disappointed if there isn't a joke about the controller vibration setting somewhere in this video.
Congrats guys, I’m happy for you both 🤘 Also, as a Sagittarius and a huge Nathan Drake/Uncharted fan, Shelby offended me. Don’t worry, I’m still subscribed 🤣
Congratulations !!!!!!!!!
Will we still have "girlfriend reviews" or will we have "wife reviews" now
You can’t do Joel like that
Imagine the shit ResetEra would be flipping if the roles were reversed here. Hi ResetEra, you humourless twonks!
The Joel picture 😭😂☠️
Hey! It's the closest I've ever been to first! 😀
That Joel Miller pic was just out of hand. Too soon
Finally! A video worthy of my time. For 11 minutes. Another video. God i spend too much time on youtube
Hearing Shelby and Matt are getting married is awesome, congrats, you guys are couple goals, props for 4 years of dedication
I expect Leon to be #1
I love you guys
Congratulations in advance on your wedding!!! 😁😁😁
Lmao I was clicking a different notification, then this one popped up and moved the other one right as my finger was coming down on the screen. So now I'm here haha
Mazel tov! 🎉
objectifying men pffft thought we was past this
Hi guys!
First
This is a interestingly informative video
Congrats on the engagement!
But you two are the hottest characters.
Bloody love your channel
Primerooooo
