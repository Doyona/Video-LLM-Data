2025 and we got a trash spirit empress...
love coming back to this vid for some classic nostalgia
7:09 why is it easy🤨
Watching this at 2025 it all lies
Bro archer queen does not wear shoes
5:16 when book of books was $5 😢😢
oj what happened to this channel :(
We didn’t get larry
2024 and we still havent gotten larry 😢
The Spiked club was not sharpe while the fish is sharper
As in 2024 this is pretty balanced 1:20
“Ohhhhhhh getting wrecked by the archer queen” 4:29
Brok costume is hard. You need to have dadrk skin colour for it to work
I have the reason why fisherman deals more damage. It because when you are slapped with the fish, not only you take physical damage, Your dignity suffers as well. Skilled fighter, slapped with a fish and eventually defeated by the fish. That is what called EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
7:16 this part pains me because it’s not Louis but Luis pronounced something like Lu-ease
1:24 we still didnt get larry
as a person who exists in 2024 we unfortunately don't have *LARRY*
Fishslap
Where is our Larry and infinity levels 😢😢😢
I also want daily gifts back.
I always disconnect 2v2 because I use my grandpa's old phone. Its a wiki/android and It really sucks
Miners health is to high and it’s damage is to low
I got a legendary from a silver chest once😁
3:40 how about getting a legendary from a silver chest (I got a magic Archer)
Max leveled golden knight when it just came out lil timmy got his hands on his moms credit card
Im luis
duplicator card: mirror but the opponents card instead
Hi i'm from the future I'm f2p and haven't maxed a single champion
After coming back a year later , SK finally got a buff , no one will probably come to read my comment.. but hey now he can counter every kind of swarm , even barbarians if they are not evolved but yeah every swarm of skeletons of goblins is just giving him free souls so finally SK is worth more than the golden knight , I think
4:25  "Getting recked by the archer queen" Sure buddy,😂
The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy. Strategy His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand. The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells. A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more. The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball. However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter. Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible. It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value. In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation. Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage. When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings. Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building. Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox. If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique. For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed. For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa. They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower. The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push. A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower. This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower. The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it. A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower. Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense. The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is. A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily. A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they happen to react to him fast enough.
THEY TOOK THE RED PILLL 😭😭😭😭😭😭
you thought that was bad?
3:20 then you probovly dident see my enemes in kid ladder playing e barbs miror pump rage skelis and all spirits exept fire sycle

6:03 me Being a f2p: "you guys are above level 10?"
5:36 do you want to use your book of books
The guy requesting a refund because he thought lvl 13 was the max level is a fool. Did that person never consider the fact that updates increasing max levels is highly possible? “Felt deceived”? What a joke. The fact that they actually got a refund baffles me.
5:57 he said mega pekka
Hog 2.6 is based
It’s cause skeleton does área damage
In 5:25 it’s talking about the distraction for PEKKA but he isn’t in that arena

thanks. i used the e-barbs carry and went up in matches directly
I'm  stuck in arena 3 because the prince.
skeleton king is just barbarian king on coc
Whoever spends money on a game thinking that it will never be updated and there will never be new content added is a dumbass. If you expect a refund because they add more content to try and make the game BETTER and appeal to more people doesn't mean that you should get one. How dumb are you to expect a game to never get updated, and how stupid do you have to be to feel offended by the fact that they UPDATE and CARE about their game.
0:19 i feel like a better solution would be a chat ban for a week
Cool story but i got chromatic surge from a free box and have been playing only for about 1-2 months
I'm playing the most annoying deck because I'm stuck at electro valley    😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
I got Fisherman from a common chest once
i really good clash royale doesn’t become what pixel gun has become
I had no idea the chances of getting legendary from gold chest is so low since i just unlocked the mega knight from a gold chest
i used the word n@zi in roblox and i got kicked from the game lmao
Istg everyone uses Mega Knight (they brought it to low Arena in my opinion) and it's so annoying even if I can counter it
2.6 hog players basically they’ll kite and ice Spirit until the musketeer and canno kills a pekka
I found someone with a champion who was only king tower lvl 13. WTH
Oj: For one elixir he just destroyed the mega knight  His mind: POSITIVE ELIXIR TRADE!!
In 2024 no ones gonna use normal cards anymore with LARRY
I’m f2p and I’m level 14

Played against level 14 champion(queen I guess) on 4900,it was 2nd day after update
Lol I loved daily gifts and quests
there is one time that there is a legendary chest in my daily gift I get my first legendary which is bandit from there
1:33 This is actually a magic item in Clash Quests
1:24 but skeleton king is Larry!
2v2 with randoms are the worst , red did a 16-elixir push , I don’t remember exactly but it included spear goblins and a skeleton giant , we had the counters to that , by “we” I mean me only , my teammate put a Skeleton Army to “defend” a VALKYRIE , and Spear Goblins to “defend” a Baby Dragon. To this day , I’m still thinking how he got to Arena 3
I actually got a legendary from a small box          Btw it was Amber XD
Atleast skeleton king is third best champion right now!
wdyn Oj i collected the dayly  gifts
4:44 Wenn du deutschsprachig bist und das lesen kannst:
its a good thing that activision didn't buy clash royale from supercell, because if they did no one is going to play the damn game
Remember quests that you could get chests from
I always used the daily gifts
1:49 plot twist she does not have shoes I'm a clash of clans player got that Queen before some of you no Lvl 14 required
They did fix the level 11 being 14 but my friend had the glitch, and he kept the two champions he unlocked
Golden Knight is just like Knight Good stats for the cost

3:27 LMFAO as a 2.6 player, I spit out my drink. Don't come too hard on us tho, we lose against heavy decks or air decks most of the time.
Yah the Skeleton King feels like he should just have a small club instead of that Mace that’s huge. Are they scared of having him with some actual damage? His ability cost 2 elixir already
i beat 2.6 players ass everytime
Skeleton King is strong💪
Calavera piper is from hyuga  clan look at her eyes
1:47 she doesn't have shoes bruh,it's in the loading screen...that triggers me so extremely much

8:36 I just nwo realized that the roza vs surge is an infinity war reference, you can see bea disappearing in the background.
Baby spike making baby squeaks.  Hold up
9:40 i think that Lola with stu is the starr Park trio
hey oj i have an idea when ur teammate leaves u in 2v2. if u just get their part of elixir also but not their cards u can deffend two at once. so for example ur teamate left during single elixir so once u start getting his elixir too only u get double elixir while your opponents continue to get single elexir. similarly while u proceed to double elixir in the match ( 60 seconds left) you should get quadruple elixir so that way u can make the match more fair and juicy cause think about it when u enter 3x elixir u'll get 6x elixir which is like getting infinite elixir!! now this is some juice!!!!!!!
Oj can you help me I think my brawl stars account is glitched I don't have any legendary tho I am lvl 100 experience...and around 15000 trophies

Average Archer Queen fan : feeble Average Skeleton King enjoyer : chad
add clash mini to meme mondays plz
This update is actually going to kill clash royale if they don’t make major changes soon, they should make it so that every crown is worth like 250 gold or something all the time because otherwise it is literally impossible to max without spending
Ash actually belongs to the Gift Shop Employees : Colette Edgar Ash
I am 13k Trophies and have 0 legendary
My friend got sandy, byron, gene and ash (last season) from 1 mega box.... on his 2000 trophy acct

1:23 it's funny because skeletons are one of the best cards in the game
11 11 is my bday
These permanent bans are absolutely crazy! OJ, can you and other major players help fix this? A lifetime ban in-game and forums can happen for things like someone trying to hack your account, language, etc. However, I've seen high-level players join a clan, convince the leader to give them elder or co so they can "invite their friends". They then promoted friends and mass kicked the clan over and over again. These guys NEVER got banned. This system is really broken. I'd like to see Supercell unban all permanent bans and come up with a system. Maybe start with a 1-year ban, followed by a 5-year ban, followed by a permanent ban? This also allows young people a chance to mature and not make foolish mistakes and be able to play the game again. Would love to see this change implemented!
"Its time for You to start asking your self the big questions" Me *HOW CAN THE FISHERMEN PULL A FULL ON GOLEM AT LEAST 3 TIMES HEAVIER THEN THE TOWER BUT CAN'T PULL A TOWER.*

7:05 *me who got Lou from the basic chest* WEAK!
Can someone explain the knight "I know what youre thinking, thats why we are friends"
Hey I collected the daily gifts I miss it
You guys are upset with getting the Skeleton King? Ok then give it to me :)
I've noticed some lvl 13's with champions, is it normal? It's too much of a shock
I don't play hot 2.6 i play hot fish the deck had log cannon hog fisherman spires guards skeleton and rocket
Is it just me, or does every Knight in the game have good stats for their cost  Knight is tanky and deals decent damage for 3 elixer  Golden Knight being able to kill or weaken groups for 1 elixer and have fast attack speed dealing some relatively high damage and being tanky for 4 elixer  Mega Knight can destroy entire pushes and counterpush right after, even with half HP the potential is still there, having area damage makes and a Jump makes it difficult to counter without tanks, all this for 7 elixer
In an age where there are so many bad, lying news channels, the Juicy News Network never fails to deliver.
Fun fact: If you got the bug where you got pushed to level 14 by the glitch in the game and got a champion when the patch came out and moved those players down to their right levels you got to keep the champion
;-; is this a reupload or am i trippin
1:43 Pov: you just realised that archer queen doesn't have shoes and already is showing her feet
Archer queen doesn't wear shoes lol
In archer queen challenge archer queen counters mega knight
GOLD REFUNDS!
Archer queen has no shoes
Nice!

I honestly thought that the thumbnail would show papyrus with a crown
Clash of clans skeleton King is coc reality's favourite

7:02 i rarely play brawl stars, and once when i was with a friend i unlocked sandy, he was freaking out was quite mad that i got it befote him  i still have no idea what the card does and i have never used it lmao
Wow Very cool
Im still confuse why people say skeleton king is bad just use a witch or a night witch but then again im bad at the game right now as an old player who has been in challenger 2 so dont fully trust my tips on this one
7:00 when you have 14k trophies and no legendarys :/
Memes.... Clash ROyale....perfect combination

Skele King should use fish bro
You should also add Cookie Run news
10:08 HA!
Its always a good day when the JNN uploads
I love how Skeleton King just blocked the Hog Rider. At least he can do something really effectively.
But hey atleast Skeleton King is the top 3 best champion currently in the game!
can anyone explain 4:33 to me
Yah the Skeleton King feels like he should just have a small club instead of that Mace that’s huge. Are they scared of having him with some actual damage? His ability cost 2 elixir already

I wanted to learn a classic cycle Deck after playing megaknight. I choose 2.6 and I regret nothing. I'm Level 11 with mostly 11 and 10 cards. Destroyed a Level 12 with Level 14 Pekka.
“They will defend a 30 elixer push with a ice spirit and cannon” No cap

Perfect video to eat my sandwich with : )
there's a reason november is censored  😏
The memes are the best thing of this channel
It sucks how the game made me 14 then took it away. I don't care if it was a bug, I had so much fun with Skeleton King and climbing ladder  This Game's glitches are absolutely Stupid, I can use use Skeleton King still and I'm level 12
Hi
Before I was good at brawl stars my friend got leon out of a free box from the shop and then my other friend got max from the shop but 1 and a half years later I have all of the brawlers (except for meg and lola  just came out shush) It was so annoying
0:46 No golden stats for the cost
4:34 I don’t get it?
XD first to dislike  I’m gonna like btw
I love this channel
If you’re level 13 and have a champion, it doesn’t allow you to put it into a deck buttttt if you were able to put it into a deck before being reset down, you can use it still lol
No I can confirm... Cloaking still makes her immun to knockback and tornado. Which is freaking op. So many good counters don't work.... Fix or remove that and she is fine.
the chat filter issue would be an insanely huge embarrassment for any other dev team, but for the clash royale dev team, that in addition to the champions they clearly didnt playtest, level fourteen which only makes the game worse for every single player, scamming everyone with slash royale and not reimbursing the gold, not balancing cards when theyve been too weak/strong for months like rage (which has been objectively broken for years, like freeze before they fixed it), furnace (nearly impossible to get an equal elixir trade on), the clone glitch that shouldve been spotted weeks before the update was sent out, and not bothering to undo clan wars II despite everyone hating it; ALL of this is just what has come to be expected. this is just how the dev team is, lazy and apathetic. can you imagine the clash of clans or brawl stars devs doing something like this; being this awful? or the btd6 devs? the minecraft devs? for gods sake, the FORTNITE devs wouldnt be caught dead being this lazy! it truly feels like whoever made the game in 2016 up and died, and someone with no interest in the game whatsoever was given a handsome check to continue their work.   i still play the game almost every day, because i keep believing that the NEXT update will fix the problems; theyre gonna remove clan wars II in the NEXT update, theyre gonna fix rage in the NEXT update, theyre gonna start caring in the NEXT update! i keep thinking that. yknow, like an idiot. theyre never going to change, and i know that, but i keep hoping anyways.   the only good thing, the only thing that is good and only good that they released this update is the challenge changes, where all players get all the cards at tournament level standard. thats the ONLY good thing they released. they released three new cards, which is neat, but 2/3 were (and still are) unbalanced, and all of them require you to level them up before theyre usable, since they didnt even bother boosting them this season. you cant even get them early and then level them up as you progress, because you only get them once youre max level, which, in case youve forgotten, is even HARDER to reach now.  the artists are the only people i can say are really doing a good job in this game. nothing clash royale has ever released has LOOKED bad (old fireball art? what old fireball art?). consistently, the tower skins, emotes, and card designs are great. thats the only thing i can praise the dev team for, and the artists arent even really developers. its sad and pathetic.  heres to hoping the december update/balance changes fix all the problems i mentioned (it wont)
Meme monday on Monday wow 🤣🤣
1:49 are they wrong tho?
Love it
