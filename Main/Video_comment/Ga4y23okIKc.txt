Andy zrehabilitujcie się jeśli chcecie. Nie pozwolą mi wpuścić do Nigerii trzystu algierczyków. Płyńcie tam. Trzeba zajebać typów którzy zaatakowali katolików i ich Zabili. 50 osób umarło, zniszczyli kościół. To pomoże de la Hoji. W walce o naród , honor i substytuty w przyszłości. Trzymam kciuki. Będe pytał jak ta sprawa była załatwiona.
Andrew. Nie rób "pizdy" nie dawaj im przed koki i teczki jarania dla mnie konfidentą. Abym jeszcze jechał po nią 20 kilometrów. Okey?. Rozumiem. Będziecie mieć swoje przydziały w obozach pracy w United. CBD te sprawy. Może nawet topa. Ale wiesz jak wygląda top który nie smakuje. Daj sobie spokój. Wiesz że dla mnie ta planeta to tylko poczekalnia. Mówie że kocham. Ale jak mówie to wtedy o tym myśle. Ale naprawde tak pomiędzy nami to info. 🤫🤫🤫🤫.
To wszystko przez was. Gdyby nie problemy w Ameryce Północnej. Z budowy największej siły armii północ której główne dowodzenie powierzyłem głównej siłę niemieckiej i amerykańskiej. Byłbym dziś jeszcze na wakacjach. A tak musze się zastanowić jak zapełnić luke gdy meksykanie mówią mi nie i myślą chujem zamiast mózgiem.
Uwielbiam ci wchodzić na psyche. Nic sobie z ciebie nie robie. Wiesz czemu?. Macie bohatera tak jak Ukraińcy gdzie jest już wojna. Waszym bohaterem jest Roy Jones jr. Ja mam tak że za każdego kata którego spotkałem wtedy. Odpowiada cały naród. Już wiesz. Macie swoje zjebania co się stało wtedy. Ale mimo wszystko. Żyjcie z nimi. Uśmiechajcie się. Aż w końcu drzwi wyjebią w powietrze i obozy pracy.
Przyjmuje to do wiadomości. Napisze ci tak. Ruszyłeś temat i pozbawiłeś ją podróżowania. Dowiem się wszystkiego. W czarnej skrzydlatej postaci poznam tajemnice o każdym. Biore pod uwage iż w tej piramidzie znajde miejsce dla wojowników którzy wiedzieli że kocham akurat te kobiety. Wiesz mi czy z jej woli czy bez jej. Rodziny tych którzy w tym uczestniczyli przestaną istnieć. W chwili obecnej jak mi podpowiedziałeś uważam się za księcia królestwa w którym mieszkam. Znają mnie tysiące osób. Nie mam kredytów. Mam własne mieszkanie. Mój tata to szef wszystkich szefów i jako emerytowany funkcjonariusz NYPD może Ci skomplikować życia w każdej chwili. Także nie myśl że będe się kajał za kostką haszu. Wyjedziesz gdziekolwiek i też nic nie znajdziesz. Także. Hamuj uśmiech? Bo zgaśniesz na starcie.
Witam witam. Jak tam jak tam. Synka przysłałeś już do Werci w popłochu twojej fortuny. Wiesz. Dadzą rade panowie z karteli na prace w Stanach Zjednoczonych w obozach pracy jak mur minie. Szanujecie zapewne danie wam szansy przezemnie. Czuje to. De La Hoya i wasza nadzieje. Ty nie jesteś crazy. Ja nim jestem. I odowodnie to wam. Tak szybko jak to się uda. Za utrate życia. Roy Jones jr. Przyczynił się do tego. I ty mnie szmaciarzu od szaleńców nazywasz. Chyba że chodzi Ci że jestem opętany. Jak przestane w to wierzyć. To będzie depresja.
HEY ANDY IF YOU READ THIS FIGHT USYC
He still didn’t get an opponent
Usyk and Ruiz are polar opposites.  Ruiz is all hand work. Usyk is all footwork. Ruiz is very active because of how many punches he throws, Usyk is very active because of how much he moves around and prepares/positions for punches, Ruiz doesn't move around so much and Usyk doesn't throw too many punches (speaking relatively for both of course)
What a nice guy Ruiz is, I thought he would be a mad fat man but he is not.
So happy Andy got his teeth did :)
Yeah this guy could’ve just laughed at AJ but he’s being mature about it
Don’t forget this humble Man knockin out the giant Anthony Joshua respect to Andy
Just like his humility...big up champ
Andy vs Wilder would be entertaining
Top guy Andy Ruiz is! Can deffo see him making a comeback him vs Wilder would be a good fight
Is Ruiz the nicest perso or what
Nice guy. They all are  except that ass Wilder. Fury talks shit.  But its part of his strategy.  At the end of the day he's humble. Now Tyson was a fricken mad dog. Although  early  on he seemed genuinely concerned about the fighters he knocked out. He would walk over  to see if they were alright  and even try and help  them up. Money fucked Tyson up combined with his upbringing.
Usyk will win the rematch w/ AJ too....Usyk looks so determined in his fights and now that he has a couple legs of the Heavyweight Championship he’s going to keep them for awhile. If I was TF I’d just enjoy 1 belt and be happy.
I’d love to see a trilogy fight with AJ in a couple years
I’m still disappointed with Andy’s reaction/lack of focus after winning the title. He’s hands-down a better fighter than Joshua but he gave it away.. 1. By not staying fit 2. Accepting the conditions of the fight aka not fighting in the USA and allowing an enlarged ring which benefitted Joshua
The man who snatched AJ’s soul at Madison Square Garden 😂
Wilder comments vs Ruiz . Wilder should learn from this man
Andy could beat Wilder.
What a gentleman!
One of the few heavyweight champs you'd actually enjoy going for a beer with. Respect, Andy.
What a nice man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He beats on the other guy then throws the fight.  Big payday
he is a very likeable person! humble and having fun with what he is doing!
such a good guy
Am glad Andy hasn't turned bitter he has stayed humble respect to his man
Happy to stumble on this video... Never knew that this guy have so wholesome, humble and nice personality, quite surprised really. My new favorite hw based on this alone, go Ruiz!
Nice bloke
I wish he couldve stayed relevant in hw boxing. I like the hell outta this guy.
If AJ gets the belts back he going to be the yoyo champ
I love how Andy didn't use his chances to derogate AJ. But I am still 💯 percent sure AJ will not speak ill if he were in his shoes also.  Respect
Ruiz, Fury and Usyk are making boxing great again!
Joshua is trash. If Usyk could punch he would have put Joshua to sleep.
Can’t wait till Parker n Ruiz fight for all world titles I know this prediction trust
Love Ruiz but I don't like the king kong fight for Ruiz. You cannot be an easy target against Luis Ortiz cause he is too accurate and a good pressure fighter. Ruiz has fast hands but i am not sure he has good enough head movement or power to keep Ortiz off.
Why would some irrelevant guys opinion matter
Cant help but really enjoy people like him
Joshua is a better fighter when he tries his Mayweather impersonation.
He looks like a kid from UP the movie.
hes a genuinely good bloke! Looking forward to seeing Ruiz back in action!
Shout out to you Ruiz please stay in shape and keep your head in the game and you will be champion once more
Didn't this dude fire his coach because he got too fat and lost the rematch? So much for personal responsibility 🙄
He is a perfect gentleman!
Love this guy!
ANDY RUIZ, what a respectful and nice human being. He's a good man
What a nice and well spoken man.
Legendary fat man who exposed Joshua first… nice
Ruiz is actually is a skilled boxer with more training he can be a world champion again
I love Mexican people. But Andy is too sweet.  Greetings from Ukraine Andy
What a lovely man Andy is.
Seems rare nowadays to see boxers , entertainers and people in general speaking without hate , Salute 💯💯💯
Didn’t expect him to be such a sweet guy
Charles martin next? Really? This guy is above that level already
where's the pizza, and burgers?  tubby lazy ruiz, this interview probably made him hungry and tired.
yup. andies o.k.
Andys to nice. He needs to throw some shade towards Fury! Fury calls him the short fat Mexican 🤦‍♂️😂 hope Ruiz gets fit an comes back strong love his fighting style 🥊🥊
Love Andy , he still looks like the kid from UP tho😂
Andy is a good man
Interesting Ruiz thinks its 50/50 for Fury v Wilder....
Andy Ruiz Vs Whyte would be a good match
Andy need to stop getting drunk and destroying his career... I don't think he will ever be a champ again.
Nice guy
Andy is genuine and cool guy, he is definitely good for boxing
Joshua is under MK - ultra how can u not see he was not in his mind. R all u people that dumb. He has the same treatment Conor Mc had.. he has a handler how can u not see he is out his mind
Andy smashed him to bits in the first fight and Joshua danced about like a fairy in the second. Great fighter and great words.
Manteca le tiene miedo a king Kong Ortiz
Great guy. God Bless ya big man
What a nice guy
He look good and in shape can't wait to see him in the ring again
ANDY RUIZ looking fresh. Look forward to his next fight.
So sad he’s looking forward to Charles Martin, instead of going for Hughie, Del Boy, Joyce as a boxing fan and knowing my fellow uk boxing fans we would welcome Andy with open arms after he gained our respect that night in USA.
Great bloke 👍👍
dude is such a killa but also a sweet dude, that's how you know he's real, lot's of heart
Andy battered him he should try and fight Usyk himself or maybe Whyte
Humble brother, It will surely turn back your favour.. We are with you brother.. Best regards from your  pacific fans.
Top guy  All the best  👍
Who wants a 3rd fighhhhht
Sympatischer Boxer.💪
Please fight Luis Ortiz
Hands down my favourite boxer this guy. always humble and thankful.
What a humble guy, class act. Natural boxer.
Doesn’t have a shot
Ни хуя не понял...
The all new AJ grill better than the George foreman grill......idea pitch because Anthony you done.
wow what a great gentle humble guy ! would be great to see him back, particularly against Ortiz
anthony joshua was always a B grade fighter in a weak modern heavyweight imo. Usyk just had well rounded skillset with nothing special and picked joshua apart. andy ruiz has power but poor stamina and can't do anything if the guy doesn't let him connect solidly, so i'd put him slightly lower than anthony joshua.
I from uk I love Andy better than AJ
Andy Ruiz IS the Kung Fu Panda.
I can’t wait for this guy to be champ again such a nice boxer.
Every time I see this guy..I like him even more. I love how he phrased his potential match with his friend as being able to "Bless one another" rather than fight. Good luck Andy!
Andy got paid to not whoop AJ IN THAT SECOND FIGHT
pleasant energy
How can you not like Andy Ruiz! He’s the most humble guy out there
I would like to see Ruiz vs Usyx
Andy gets kidnapped  Andy "I'm so blessed to be here "
This kid is such a true gentleman and champion. I wanna see Ruiz fight Wilder and Fury. I don’t think either one could deal with Ruiz’ speed and power. AJ has to get his killer instinct fired up. That’s why he lost to Usyk. He wasn’t confident in himself.
Ruiz is a hell of a guy.
Can andy beat usyk?
luis ortiz   vs andy ruiz  is time now
Hats off to Andy Ruiz. Getting those belts back. Great attitude
Was waiting for Andy to say "It was a blessing"
Brilliiiaaaaantttt AJ
Comes across as a diamond geezer
Boy is a bum. How he look fatter everytime you see him tho.
wooow...he doesnt make fun of AJ...nice
Ruiz is a true respectful fighter . The mark of a real man . Total respect to him . . Hope all is well for his return after surgery . From UK . .
Cause alot of the HW's trouble if he stays in a good shape. Him vs Whyte would be a good one.
How nice boxing is with such fair play attitude champions.
Starting of saying ruiz the heavyweight champion of the world “no he’s not” AJ had the wrong game plan the man ain’t F#CKEN super man he takes the big fights unlike most people like fury & wilder even ruiz,because fury wilder and ruiz have turned down offers from dillian whyte,so being AJ if you swim with sharks your going to get bit at some point,in fury & wilders case “you swim with gold fish and you’ll be safe”  Ruiz is a good fighter but he’s nothing he’s been made out to be,he got a win of AJ and that made him,but I’m glad people are writing of AJ because it makes the win that much better AJ showed everyone why not to write him of last time so it would be stupid to do it again
Dyllian whyte needs to get a piece of ruiz. Be a great fight, power vs skills
Definition of fat and happy.
The Ukrainian/Russian mobs are taking over boxing.For the next 20 years atleast.
Andy is optimistic , positive, childish looking , which is good
Hey, this dude is cooler than I thought, he just won a fan after this interview, cheers Andy. I'm looking to subscribe to his channel if he has one.
Nice guy!😉🥰
Lets review your second fight with anthony joshua and your return fight with over the hill class C fighter arreola.
Damn that chin can fit another mouth..
what a nice dude!
Good lucky Andy would love to see you back in a title fight one day!
AJ is a powerful puncher but not the best in ring IQ in 12 rounds. Meaning he can't adapt to a tactical opponent and beat him in 12 rounds, however, he will watch the fight, take lessons from the loss and come back a better boxer and if Usyk fights the same fight in the rematch, AJ beats him.
what a nice guy!
Ruiz v Usyk would be a great fight, hurry up and get fit Andy …………………….
This interview has made made me love Andy more..He's the realiest..
Hope to see Ruiz back at the top Great talent
I feel bad for AJ but man, that loss opens the door for so many matchups. The combinations and storylines are endless.
Andy is class...He made a lot of fans from the UK during his two AJ fights...Top bloke....Andy fan from the UK
You just failed badly to do the dance with AJ last fight to much eating and partying.
I'm a fan of his. I believe in him and I think that he'll end up with one of the 25 belts that are out there. Go Andy ✊🏾✊🏾
he has mark on top lip
Wonder how he afforded them WHITE NASHERS
Cmon Andy let’s see u back in the ring we miss ya
Buen boxeador Andy Ruiz quisiera ver una pelea entre el y el Cubano Luis Ortiz y el que gane que vaya por un título.
1:18 somebody had some good frijoles and shit
Andy total gentleman and class act 👌 him and Joseph Parker two nicest heavyweights in boxing 🙏
Good for you Andy :-) Get those belts back !
Former*
Ruiz is high caliber. I think he's greater than his showing vs Joshua.
Usyk vs Ruiz
Andy is such a sweetheart
Kernowski lol
Imperial county California!!
Fury Wilder III a 50, 50 fight, LOL
RUIZ IS THE BEST SKILL POWER HIT IN THE HW RANK. HE CAN BEAT ANY OF THE TOP 10 RANK
U have to love this guy...
So nice 😊 and a fkn killer ☠️
The main problem with Joshua is his attitude and mentality. It's almost like he doesn't want/like the throne. He needs to be hungry or maybe his heart is not into it anymore.
He’s looking in excellent shape
Andy new teeth ruiz
Love that dude. Nicest and realest dudes ever.
You should be able to fight the winner of Wilder or fury
I like that every fighter has to take responsibility!
Sounds like a a sound guy,
The truculent snowstorm occasionally bow because lumber steadily preach absent a pleasant debt. ludicrous, vulgar clover
Great to see Ruiz with a bright glint in his eyes again. Hard not to like him when he's grounded and focused.
If can loose a little weight, he might do better at cruiserweight
You gotta respect this guy ! Did well. No bitterness against AJ despite the right. Just honesty and grafting behind the scenes! Gotta rate it
Andy has some pretty silly looking dental veneers going on.
Ruiz seems like a really nice guy!
Minor hiccups; but Andy's personality and character is still top class.
The top ten heavyweights in the world today would never have made it in the 80s and 90s when the best fought the best and even the contenders were monsters.  The world celebrates mediocrity nowadays in everything, sport, music and film has fallen badly.
"CHAOS IS A LADDER " LOL
Andy has a good future he needs to train very hard
Good Luck Andy..!
Very humble guy to be fair I do like Ruiz I hope he can fight his way to top 5 would be interesting tbh
a.j. needs george foreman in his corner
I have met Andy stand up guy
Like to see him fight Usyk
I'd love to see Andy in action, he brings it on !!
yeah he seems like a really cool guy! peace to Andy!
Andy's such a good dude always with a clean spirit and a happy mood. Wish you the best Andy everybody loves you kid.
Usyjk and Joshua s fight was just a simulation.
Ruiz should fight dillian whyte
Need a few tune ups before those names. Don't rush Ruiz
Wow. Spoke some realness.
I wouldn’t take any advice from this one punch wonder, who than throws it all away by being an undisciplined ass
I always find it so funny when Ruiz and Wilder say they blessed their opponent while they knocked them the spark out lol
if he was dedicated he could probably make cruiserweight
I remember when Andy Ruiz had Anthony Joshua fans really worried .
Gang member..
I'm a big fan of ruiz since his fight with aj. Not just because of the size of the upset but I think hes one of the most exciting boxers in the heavyweight division. His fights are always exciting and hes so so dangerous. Takes a hit like a sponge and great handspeed too. Have a lot of respect for him despite his tendencies to lose focus and discipline.
Ruiz wat a lovely guy respect Manchester England 🤟😎💪👍
🤣🤣🤣👍 Tyson's the boss he gna  whip wilder boring yet again retire undefeated he's the boss guys 💪👍
What? Did I hear well?  50-50 chances for wilder vs Fury!!! It has to be a joke!😁 Fury dominate him, beaten him two times easy so it's more 9 to 1 chance in favor of Fury. Fury would beat easily Joshua and would beat Usyk too but less easily.
Forget ruiz lmao. This guy is out of the conversation
Seen him in a couple of his fights very impressed with his strength and fighting instinct Ill be rooting for him after seeing this interview
Andy disapointed me on the AJ rematch. Had chance to stay Champion but decided to screw camp and go on a Taco eating spree.
Good guy Andy👍
NOW ... Rulz, making comeback  and winning the TITTLE BELTS.. would be UP there in BOXING HISTORY  also...  If Rulz did get to fight Tyson GYPSY KING Fury  could the venue please be behind the local shops
I think Andy could give usyk a good fight. His hand speed is quicker than usyk and just as good a boxer only down fall is his fitness. If Andy can train like a sprinter along with his boxing training, do more cardio and sprint work to improve stamina fast twitch fibres with leg and arm explosive moments would make Andy a real force.
lets see you vs chisora
What a class act. Mr Wilder take note.
I think Joshua had to much Respect for Usyk from start to finish and he showed it a little too much. Joshua definately held back and didnt seem his usual self similar to the first fight with Ruiz.
Wen he said medicine he almost said steroids lol 😂
Humble guy
he's a true fighter he has respect  for fighters and talked a lot of sence
A REALLY REALLY NICE GUY!!!
After the interview he went to McDonald's.
I’m not a fan of Ruiz but he’s very polite I like him
I just hear Jack Black everytime he talks
This guy is very likable. 🙂
Well said, what a nice guy
Ruiz is classy person and what he said was facts 🇬🇧
Get back in shape champ and see you soon in the ring. Top guy 👍
Wow This is the first time I've ever really listened to Andy Ruiz speaking. What a very humble man. I like this guy 👍🙂👍
I'm sure Andy has new bling bling teeth 😁
Andy seems like a happy & sound guy stay healthy & grounded top guy 🙏
AJ found out once again. Where have all his fanboys gone??
I think a very fit ruiz gives usyk problems Great hands Solid chin But again has to be very fit and improve foot speed
Like a little kid, happy about Somone else's Demise. Sad little man is in the world and money now rums his emotions and the thought of being a contender......humble is out of the window🤨
so chilled and cool nice dude and good fighter
What a nice bloke👍
I really thought Ruiz would kick AJ a little bit.
Andy the man who finished Joshua's career by exposing his chin .  2. Making joshua conscious about his chin. Joshua wont get close to fighters anymore.  Thus his title reign is done .
How i wish u could fight Usyk. I like your fighting style.
Love Andy Ruiz a very good boxer
Andy got no chance getting the belts back. He was bullied by AJ in second fight He doesn’t have the boxing skill of Usyk to outclass the bigger boxers
I'd have asked Ruiz how he knows Wilder and Fury well and whether they made friends with Ruiz so they don't have to fight him
Everyone roots for Ruiz secretly.
50/50 Fury vs wilder is he crazy its öike 99/1 Fury will fucking kill Wilder
I love this man, so humble and respectful  😊😊 l do hope he wins the title again.
what is it that almost all people withening there teeth?un natural
Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world, so that those who do not see may see and those who see may become blind."
recover well, get fit and train young man - go get it !
What a guy,no trash talking,no finger pointing just honest assessment of the situation👏✌️🥊
Andy check out my HW boxing book Champion. It has a gym setting at Big Bear and another one at Salton Sea
In all honesty I believe you fought the fittest and most determined Chris we have seen in years
Looking great Andy  Let's see the Tie-Breaker vs Aj
Andy you legend, big heart
Top bloke. Would love to see him beat AJ again.
AJ didn't know how to fight usyk at all, and AJ was a lot taller and stronger for sure but instead of fighting tall and letting usyk fall into his range and unload... he let usyk dictate everything... that's only my opinion though. Usyk is really good though and a bad match up for AJ specially he has this habit of fighting as small dude when he's not.
No one mentions Eje Ajagba, I would not either.
Andy needs to get back in the ring and snag that belt back
Usyk would ko Ruiz in Five or six
My manz Andy Ruiz jr took joshua's soul.  I was a fan of Andy before the parker fight, not some casual who gave him sh!t because of his weight then jumped on the bandwagon after he beat joshua.
I LOVE this guy. His victory over AJ was the things dreams are made of. Yes...he made many mistakes afterwards, but who among us hasn't made big mistakes?? It's clear he learned from them and I expect great things from this awesome dude in the future!
Thought hed lost weight?
So humble and real, kudos to you , Ruiz...
Love seeing Ruiz there looking all sweaty and healthy on the road to bringing that title back to SOCAL!!!  #ANDYRUIZARMY !!
Use his boxing abilities 🤔🤔 am English he should never have boxed with usyk, usyk is o Lightyears ahead of Joshua at boxing
Andy's speed would be a great match for Usyk.
I always like how the guys who can crack people's skulls open are usually humble and nice people.
50/50 how do you come to that conclusion after seeing both fighters 😂😂
He turned very arregant when he got that bag more so the win
He’s a genuinely nice guy. No bluster or bullshit.
He’s too nice
Usyk way under estimated  ,, the level of boxing ability is the very best ,  they wouldn't go down a weight to fight him , truly ignorant from msm towards usyk,  if Joshua had won the talk !??!?
I like this guy way of seeing perspective for the future fights.
Broooo I just met Andy yesterday at gens Korean bqq in SD shit was wild I just happened to Sit right behind his group haha thought I was dreaming
That Ortiz fight is all up to you, Mr smiles, and you won't take it. He would dismember you like a child does with a toy. You will look for other way to get a title shot.
Nice guy and very dangerous.  Wonderful puncher
Why did you give him the second fight Ruiz???
Everyone can say what they want about Ruiz  but this dude took AJ's confidence and soul and never gave it back.
Andy partied like it was 1999 and paid for it in the second fight with AJ
AJ didn’t “run around” in the second fight Andy. He whooped your fat behind. YOU QUIT the fight when you decided not to train for the rematch you quitter. You cheated your fans that bought tickets to watch you make history. 🖕
Ruiz should fight AJ, now that AJ doesn’t have any belts so path should be clear
Ruiz  you are the man
what a lovely guy
You came in 30lb heavier full blown fatty he can’t do that to usyk
Andy the real champ he is undefeated he clearly won the fight with Parker and the second fight with Joshua was rigged and staged. Not the body the elite boxers want to see. Andy I know the truth
All respect to rob but he was away with the England squad when Joshua needed him more than ever
Next world champ, right mindset right camp.
Now's your chance to get back in the mix :-)
Still fat and out of shape but with fresh veneers... come on man, is this seriously a contender?
you are humbal man....and god bless you..bro.... you are a good man..
have u been working on ur neck? these guys are always asking this or that but never to the fighter about the fighter. we seen u look real good and adapting the new style but the loss of weight took something out of ur shock absorbers have u and ur coach fixed it? what type of exercise has he added on. just my thought on it.
...But why These new tooth?
In the second fight with you he fought scared and ran away but the problem is you were not in shape. You could have either wise pressed it more. AJ is a poor boxer.
Aj is done , needs to work at a gym or something can’t box too slow sorry brudda time is up
Andy Great Boxer.And man,Hope we see you soon,All the best from,Essex Englan.
What a dude most humbled person he's such a lovely fella respect
If I had a argument with him on the phone, I'd hands down meet up with him  for a fight...
god dam Andy Ruiz is such a frickin nice guy !
Ruiz ruined AJ.
Love andy ❤️❤️❤️
Andy is a genuine good human…
Buster Douglas 2.0
Na. Joshua just can’t take a hit. Period. Brain concussion?? Something internally going on??
Good luck Andy what a nice guy👍
I always admire this kid, he stays so simple, humble and straight forward, always happy like a little kid. I'm hoping he gets another shot as he's still within the top rated heavyweights.
R.E.S.P.E.C.T , good sportsmanship . Didn't hate on any fighters, even the ones he lost to. Good MAN
Не понимаю я по вашему
he lowkey have such a wholesome voice
Andy is obviously a likable guy.. but I’m still disappointed in him for being so out of shape I’m the rematch. Slap in the face to every fan he won in the first fight.
Really.cool dude is Andy
how can you not like Andy? love when boxers show their contemporaries respect
Ruiz definitely had his teeth sorted
I agree with Andy. You can't only blame the trainer and AJ did not look like himself.
Give him credit - he's not so delusional as to think he's entitled to a title shot again anytime soon, or without winning his way back into one.
This man has ruined AJ's career. AJ is now scared to fight. Big UP Ruiz, I hope you come back strong. From the Uk
I always liked Ruiz as a fighter. For some reason some guys just can't deal with success. Hopefully Andy learned something about himself and he'll get another shot  at the title. Whatever happens he can always say he was champ.
Heavyweight champion of the world?
JOSHUA RUIZ III ?
100% CLASS
no one cares
I think Joshua knows fighting Usik 3 times beating him the rematch and creating a trilogy can make more money and less risk a guy coming up from light heavyweight better option for him than fighting Wilder, or Fury
Kownacki...Yeah....awesome
What a nice guy, respect brother ✊🏼 💯
What a top fella Ruiz is .
Andrew is such a nice guy .Who could not love him.
oh  fuch, a btcher put knife pn his knee., NOT A GOOD DEAL, DOCTORS ARE LIKE CAR MECHANICS especially her in the USA.
How can you not like this happy lad?
If Andy Ruiz would have lost weight for the second fight and been in shape he would have beat AJ in the second fight! Andy let himself and his team down!
Maybe USYK was just far to Good Mr Pork Pie..
andy Ruiz vs usyk will be good
Andy who ??? Is he back to fighting bums again
Great man get better soon 🙏👍👊💯
total gentleman
This will happen in box. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6wadFAs7VQ
He’s a lovely lad and a great boxer and he will come back soon
Love to see Andy come back and make a few jaws drop. Come on son 👍
Heavyweights are the nicest guys.
Andy will shock the world again an be proud as the greatest Mexican hw  in history - he deserves it as top guy an sweet skills- respect ar.... Uk
Ruiz always humble & smiling 🙂 if more people was like him the world would be a better place..
They should go a 3rd time it's 1-1
Hurry up and fight someone with a pulse tubby!
Andy looks like he is back in shape  Can’t wait to see him back in action
Has he got new teeth?🧐
Clenbuterol!
Lots of respect for Andy in the UK.  Biggups champ, look forward to your next fight.
And maybe just maybe Joshua was told to lay down and take the next payday rematch.
Love him
Meilleur boxeur du monde extra
There’s nothing I can say bad about Ruiz he’s a true gentleman I hope he has another chance at the title again the belts are now up for grabs
Усик Топ! №1 Andy №2!!!
Anthony Joshua fought on the wrong night. Poor coaching strategy
Everyone boxer here
Exactly...can't blame everybody. This sort of thing always happens after fighter losses... bad strategy, bad trainer and on and on...what would happen if AJ won?  then the strategy was fine, the trainer was god...wtf? people always say stupid shit like that it's our nature
You ain’t never gonna be champ- USYK A Beast…..
A J. Developed a New Syndrome . Called.. "SSO" *Speedy Short Opponents* That Came Originally from  The Iron Man   Mike Tyson. The Beats in Boxing History.   *TBBH*
Who cares what cheeseburger says
Nice guy but he looks like the guy that ate the ruiz who beat AJ.
You and Usyk 2 different fighters Usyk will beat you easily Andy sm
Looking forward to seeing you fight again. All the best Andy.
Let's be clear ...AJ only won the Ruiz 2nd fight by running around the ring .
Andy has turned a new leaf and mentally fit! I'm happy to see him in this mode; Best of luck champ!
Everybody loves Mexican fighter not only because they are hell of a fighters but all of them are humble and modest.
Seems like a solid nice bloke, and a very good boxer, good luck to him as he offers something different to the heavyweight scene
Shame of Mexico talking bs..
Luiz Ortiz is one hard man, he was beating Wilder X2 untill he got caught. Would be an interesting fight against Ruiz.
Andy’s a lovely guy. Be nice to see him back on top.
Hell. I'm embarrassed I called Ruiz a bum a couple of days ago because he's a really good nice guy and It caught me totally by surprise. I expected him to trash-talk Joshua all the time but he was just the opposite and was respectful and polite about Joshua.......and after that performance it is JOSHUA that is the bum and not Andy Ruiz. Andy.....you are a gentleman and I apologise for my flippant remark made in the heat of the moment.
With the potato farm, it is better to use kelp, you can make a small kelp farm on top and also make fuel out of the dried kelp. Video on my channel if your not sure.
Ruiz vs whyte would be a fight I would love to see
Andy pretends he's Mexican. he's never even lived in Mexico.
Much love and respect from the UK Champ. Looking forward to watching you fight again.
Nice Chap
All these heavyweights are nice guys or tough who can’t really fight
I wonder why AJ didn't or couldn't move around. Usyk was rotating and giving him the angles and feints all day long
Fun fact, ANDY RUIZ has never been sick (never thrown up/puked). He wrote it in his autobiography, which is a really good read by the way.
andy seems hungry
Andy sweats  as he speaks   seems that his power blows everypart of his body even through his mouth like wanting to chew Anthon again!
Did he say get BACK in shape?😂
I like ARs fight IQ. I hope he works his way into training or promoting
Plenty of epic battles left in you Andy 🥰🥇🦾✝️
Great guy, so complimentary and chilled.
He look like the little boy off the movie UP 🎈
I can see Andy dominating the heavy weight division. True kind hard working fighter with sharp fast bararges of heavy punches.
Anthony's one of those fighters who likes the chase and wants to feel like an underdog. He gets lazy when he's champion.
A positive minded man 💯
Na Andy mate it’s quite simple really.... YOU humbled AJ and you’ve put the fear of god into him getting clipped on the button, massive respect from the U.K. Champ 🥊 🇲🇽 🇬🇧.
Ever since he beat AJ, AJ has never been the same.
Usyk and Ruiz will be a good fight..
If ruiz got in shape he would defeat usyk.
This guy was a on one an still is nice one
I would love to see Ruiz vs Whyte!! That would be an absolutely awesome stupendous exciting fight!!!!
What a nice guy.
Andy a kool chill dude. Like him a lot. All the best.
Props to Andy good guy.
Seems a nice guy but he's as far from them belts as I am from hanging out the back of Taylor swift.😃
Joshua controls his own corner ,, he’s gun shy and they all know it ? That’s why he didn’t go after USYK , add in USYK hurt Joshua early and late in the fight ,, Joshua could well get stopped in the rematch ,, as for this Numpty the 3 fighters he mentioned as possibly his next fight !! Bums , they are all avoiding the Brits ,, horizontal YANKS that’s all you have in the heavyweight division ,, the Brits have it the Brits have it 😜🍻👏🏼
I think Andy Ruiz done the right thing , he's a decent boxer but he's never going to be heavy weight world champion again.  He fully enjoyed and made the most of becoming Mexicos first Heavy weight champion. Good lad 👍👍👍
Andy ‘he’s a good friend of mine’ ruiz
Andy should go back to the trainer who made him champion..
Great guy top man
Ah man.. I thought ruiz would fight someone more interesting next... Man boxiing is so disapointing
My favourite fighter.....
AJ is scared to get hit in the face, Andy is not....
This guy just can't stop eating !!
This man got robbed the trilogy
Andy shouldn't drop to much weight.. just be himself...strong with quick hands...i definitely wanna see him fight Ortiz...if andy can take some names i feel the 3rd Joshua fight is a real possibility...wilder to even fury...big big paydays 👌
I like this guy and he’s a good dude and hope he makes a comeback!
I love Ruiz,  he is always nothing but class,  never talks shit or brags  just does his job would love to see him against Oysk.
Hes right more chaos in the division there are more opportunity for diversity
He should fight Dillan.
It's a lot easier moving and boxing against Ruiz compared to Usyk
Damn, sounds humble and intelligent. Respect.
Mike Tyson vs Andy Ruiz 2021 December Let's Get It Done!!!
Ruiz looks like some guy from high school that you get together to play video games with 🤣
He will never be Champ 🏆 again  he took it for granted. You see in his last fight he looked like shit 😳
Dude is likeable
Highly underrated heavyweight.
I want to see Ruiz vs Frank Sanchez... would never happen though
Looks like he gained the weight back
Nice to see you back, Andy. I believe you can beat Usyk, if you are well prepared!
The heavyweight division is wide open!! Who wants it???
50/50 fight lol Fury does him in Ruiz, u wouldnt stand a chance vs Fury an u know it 🤣
Glad to see andy turn himself around. he went a little savage after he won against aj. beef all over the place
Stick in there Andy get yourself in shape you can be the best of the best! At your peak bye bye AJ, bye bye Usyk, bye bye Wilder and you would knock the biggest fake of them all Fury!!
Such a genuinely good kid! Refreshing and props to his pops!
True champion
I think Andy feels blessed
1:00 Ironic how he's being asked this question, when ruiz kicked his coach out of his team cuz he lost to Joshua
Ruiz already ready exposed aj no speed
Les hope he whips AJ's racist arse again!
Got some safe fights in mind! Got to do a bit more to.get shot at the title mate. Love the guy and want him.to do better. Maybe a fight with Wilder when he looses would do him.good.
Doesnt look like he lost much weight lol
Can't wait for Andy to back in the belt running, AJ just got his arse whooped by Usyk.
Cools boxer
Too many fights needs to happen. Ruiz Vz Usyk, Ruiz vs Deyonte, AJ v Fury, Usyk vs Fury. Lets ket more dates happening.
Ruiz the Man. Can't wait to see you in the ring agian. ❤ bro
When AJ got up from Klitchko and put him down that was amazing so was the ruiz vs AJ 1st fight... this heavyweight boxing era is a real treat
As he had his teeth done
we love RUIZ IN THE RING AND OUT THE RING.
the best personalty in boxing ANDY RUIZ
Ortiz would be a good fight for Ruiz
Hats off for Andy  giving a fair and balanced response without gloating over AJ's loss
WTF ?? People wake up why you worshiping AJ as a God. He was the most overated boxer on the planet. Stop crying.  Do u think rematch will be different? He'll no Usyk will not relax and second time he will be twice effective.
Dillian Whyte deserves his title shot, but i would love to see Andy Ruiz fight Dillian Whyte. I think I'd back Andy Ruiz to win it but it would be a war.
I like Andy Ruiz man he's so likeable and he's definitely got the potential to be up there with the best
I think he loss the first time to avoid wilder. This time he really just lost because he wasn’t good enough. He’s a bum.
I like this guy!!!
Andy has the heart of A Lion, unpredictable  fast hands with heavy weight knock out power , my all time favorites have always been Ali ,  Tyson , Hagler , & now RuiZ is part of my G O A T list.
All the best for Andy.  He's got so much talent and potential.  If he can stay committed to training, I'd love to see him get another title shot after the dust settles around the big 4.
Just because is well spoken and conducts like a gentleman he is gay ? I bet Any Ruiz will knock the homophobic rage right out of you.. Andy Ruiz is a class act...go home haters ..
shouldnt he say former heavyweight champ of the world when referring to ruiz?
There's just nothing to not like about Andy Ruiz. He is an inspiration to all of Mexico and a true, pure, fighter. I Truly believe, that we will see ARJ in another heavyweight title fight. He is a superb brawler, exciting to watch and of course... He was the Heavyweight Champion of the World. Let's never forget that.
It speaks volumes that all these guys at the "top" are claiming AJ stumbled instead of calling it how it is. Usyk is the best technical fighter in the division.
If I didn't know better and someone told me Ruiz was just an old looking 22 year old I'd believe them
You mean Former Heavyweight champ smart guy
Andy is a very nice man and I love to see him fight.
Kownacki, Martin, Ortiz......All PBC guys......Boxing, especially PBC makes me wonder why I'm a fan.
Only cowards talk shite about a fellow fighter losing. Good to see andy isn't one ❤️🤜
50/50 hahahahahahahahahahah more like 5/95
If it can be made and they both keep on winning, would love to see Ruiz vs Usyk in due course.
Damn Andy is looking fit and healthy. his glowing..... that size is much better for him then when he dropped all that weight
Would be interesting usyk v ruiz.
You vs Ortiz, would be great
He didn’t run from you it’s called boxing 🥊
Humble champ
God bless yoy Ruiz, you are such a re3al man, how could he keep his fist idle there from rounds to rounds, usyk did not do anything special order that his usual thing, there was no big deal in the fight rather it was the most ridiculous showdown to watch, l think AJ played a game with us, he had better get back there and use those idle fists of his in the rematch, if you did nothing in a fight , your opponent will try to do what you did not do, that was the fight he fought, usyk was not formidablye to him , he hit usyk once and we could see that his punch was so heavy on usyk , then he stopped fighting, AJ come get back and collect those belts you just gave out. fans are angry with your complasence in the match
I love when he beat aj
Ruiz is a good guy but is lucky to have held those belts.
I feel I very feel
Real piss off he didn't take that second fight serious
the man who exposed AJ for the fraud he is. AJ till this day is scared to let his hands go.
Just knowing how really sweet n respectfully nice Ruiz is. God bless him
Love to see Ruiz and King Kong… great fight!!
RE-SKY REPORTER ON THE JOSHUA USYK FIGHT> JOHNNY NELSON, USED TO LOOK VERY VERVOUS ( IN HIS SHEFFIELD GYM ) EVERY TIME GLENN Mc CROY'S NAME WAS MENTIONED, ( YES HE NEVER FOUGHT GLENN McCRORY ) OR EVER ANYONE WITH ANY SOUL ! HE STOLE THE TITLE FROM CARL THOMSON  ( WHACH THE FIGHT AND YOU WILL SEE >SHAMEFUL HOW HE COULD THINK HE WAS THE NEW TITLE HOLDER ) JUST ANOTHER CLOWN WHO WENT INTO THE RING TO TRY TO RIDICULE HIS OPPONETS TRY TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE  ( SCHOOLBOY TACTICTS BY A VERY NERVOUS EGOISTIC PRODUCT OF THE BRENDEN INGLE GYM ALONG WITH JOKE NASEEM HAMED ) A REAL SHAME THAT USYK WASN'T AROUND TO FIGHT THE CLOWN IN THE GOWN JOHNNY THE JOKE NELSON AND EXPOSES HIM FOR WHAT HE WAS, JOHNNY NELSON WOULD HAVE BRICKED HIMSELF AND CLIMBED BACK OUT OF THE RING 🤡
How can you not love Ruiz? Always humble and positive. His victory celebration after the TKO of AJ is straight out of a Hollywood feel-good movie
Great to see Andy ! I hope he doesnt rush back into the ring, no one wants to see Andy fight too many contender caliber fights. So great to hear that Ruiz is in discussions to fight a guy (Kownacki) that is scheduled to fight Helenius next week. That just shows you how serious Andy is about his career. Lets hope Andy takes his time and if he cant make the Kownacki fight work out for late 2022 he can find the perfect opponent for his 2023 return to the ring. Great pace Andy , I know the sanctioning body HW rankings are going to wait for you.
This is a good hard puncher. I hope He gets his self in great fighting shape and gets another shot at the title. And the man has a good chin.
The amount of people who kicked this man when he was down was disgusting.
Man is a fan boy of canelo
Dude seems like a very good regular guy
Everybody has to take responsibility for himself....but didn't this guy fire his trainer after he lost his rematch with A.J. ?
Ruiz is cool
( Former) heavy weight champion of the world.
I like the way he laughs all the time 😂🤣 he's a sympathyc man
Late 22?I mean i get it usyk  gonna be a busy guy for a distant future, there is Fury/Wilder winner, plus AJ rematch. In a perfect world Ruiz already should be in talks for a title fight
Such a nice guy...I really like him and his dope tattoos,I'll cheer Andy on aslong as he's not fighting a UK guy
Joshua's corner men are rubbish! They can't give good advice in the corner during the fight.
Haha Andy laugh at beginning
Andy seems a total gentleman and all round nice bloke..
Ruiz v usyk would be a good fight ruiz hits hard in the pocket and ruiz would be wanting range to get the jab off
AJ just lost with the wrong tactics,Rematch surely going win!!
Maybe fight Robert Helenius, whos going to KO Adam Kownacki again, in Fury vs Wilder fight night
Get that title back Ruiz!
Personally l think Andy Ruiz Junior is the nicest heavyweight champion out there - such a likeable guy - sure he is an ex champion but fingers crossed he will get another shot and he is big trouble for anybody- good luck ARJ 👍🥊🥊🇬🇧
I definitely think he’ll win the heavyweight championship again
Ruiz was unfit. Massively Overweight. and all partied out when he went into the second fight against AJ and he still took him the distance. I think a fit Ruiz would have won the second fight too.
Andy Ruiz can beat any heavy weight boxers 👍Andy Ruiz is a good fighter 👍♥️♥️♥️🥊🥊🥊
its easy to say that until your fighting him, Usyk wins rematch as well 😂
Man loves food more than boxing, it's a shame really he could of been a really good champ
Fight Dillian whyte or you to scared
good brudda this
Love this guy. He could rule the roost if he was disciplined & had a like minded crew around him.
he sounds like po from kungfu panda
Shit happen when u underestimated your fight,same happened a.j vs ruiz 1
Usyk vs Ruiz? Both very skillful. Ruiz would come to fight and avoid going the distance.... this would be more exciting that Usyk vs Fury. What do you think??
AJ's trainer gets the blame for his loss, but Noone on the planet has ever talked about How Lomachencko's father told him not to engage the first 6 rounds of his fight vs Teofimez. These trainers can lose a fight for a fighter especially when they listen exactly to their coach and trust them. I have seen this for years.
Andy Ruiz first fight with Joshua really got to Joshua.. he’s not the same guy after that
Ruiz and Usyk...... two of the nicest guys around. I know some of you are Wilder and Fury fans..... but their attitude, mouth, the way they are towards other boxers is more like bloody american wrestling, always sounding like they are shouting abuse from a script.... it is a joke. These guys are true gents
I love Ruiz, he's a freaking tank. Anyone facing his power has to think twice. Hopefully he'll drop a few pounds, pick up a bit more head movement and ring generalship. I think he could be unstoppable if he focuses in on the couple things he needs to round out his game.
I highly doubt Andy will become a world champ again. You can tell he's not hungry anymore. He's a nice guy but not HW champ material anymore.
Don't blame the trainer Joshua just can't fight
Respect Ruiz for his humbleness I wasn't expecting it
I'd love to see Whyte or Ortiz vs Ruiz. That would be entertaining
Did he just compare Oleksander Usyk to Chris Arreola 😯
I'd like to see Dylan White v ruiz  that would be a hell of a flight
Andy will annihilate Usyk in a hot dog eating competition.
The interviewer literally said it if AJ beat usyk and fury won basiclly the division would of been locked up AJ losing opens up more ooprtunities to keep the division going starting to think it wa a fix
GOOD GUY, not talking rubbish about others!
Every man that gets in the ring is a warrior there will nearly always be a winner and a loser and often if can be any one of them, the public show such disrespect to the loser when many of them wouldn't even have the stones to have a white collar boxing 🥊 match
Loves the LORD - my type of person
Too late he had his chance and chucked it away
Let’s Go Champ 👍👍
Charles Martin isn't in the same league I want to see him fight Whyte,  Joyce, Chisora boxers of quality.
Can’t wait to see Ruiz back in the ring…🥊🥊🥊
Andy Ruiz and Anthony Joshua are both humble in victory and in defeat.  Much appreciation for these two fine gentlemen and athletes.  They are the type men we all would like to have a beer with.  God Bless them and their families.
PS.Thanks for Respect regarding AJ and fellow fighters.🙏💯👍🥊
Well done Andy.your a Real fella and christian.people really respect you and hopefully see you soon.God Bless 👍🙏🙏🙏💯
Andy would KO WIlder if they fought
Ruiz vs Usyk would be great and the Winner face Fury vs Wilder.
If Ruiz can lose a few stone and train hatlrd he be unstoppable this guy can hit
He gives me po vibes
Would love to see Usyk vs Andy
He knows better how Aj going to come back …
Good guy. Hope you recover soon and also lose some fat and get fit.
Lets go champ! AR future 2 time champ!
Andy Ruiz tienes todos los attributos para ser un gran campeon no mames no desperdicies tantas bendiciones hermano
He is a baby faced assassin
Can't wait to see Andy fight again, he's fun to watch with crazy hands when he wants to let them fly
Fury and Wilder 50/50? Ruiz is pathetic.
Crap take on the actual fight. Few people within boxing can admit they were completely wrong about the outcome. It's all -"Wrong strategy. Underestimated.". What garbage. All excuses.
Bruh you can’t help but nothing to like Andy because he’s cool asf 💯
Something about Andy I don’t like. I feel he always puts a fake smile and try’s to act humble when he’s not. That’s why when he was at top he lack training and motivation.
Really like this guy. Legitimate Gladiator.  Best of luck.
Andys first class act very respectful young man
No 3rd fight for Andy they did him dirty
Ruiz encontró el punto débil de Anthony y demostró que no importa lo grande que seas todo hombre caí a la lona
Andy Ruiz is a winner in this life and more importantly the next one. What a Spirit!
He is not heavy weight champion it’s former
AJ may not have a problem losing since the Ruiz fight. Don’t be surprised if AJ wins the rematch just in order to regain the title back and potentially get a bigger payday with more eyes tuning in to see the rematch.
What a genuinely nice guy. Hope he’s enjoying life it sure looks like he is in a healthier manner now!
Man you lucky. Your last opponent was close.
How wonderfully refreshing to hear a man in the boxing world speak so respectfully, and nice to see him back in training and I wish him all the best for his future fights….
Andy Ruiz has very bright positive looking eyes and expressions. He’s humble indeed!
Don’t know why some of these? Boxers are discrediting usyk for a great performance,there just jealous of him,there all making the mistake of thinking usyk had a bad fight against derek,they don’t realise usyk was injured before the fight
Is there a deli in that gym?
Wilder always rooted for you now you turn your back on him wow what a clown you are
Joshua cant defend too good when his oponent throws punches in bunches like Andy Ruiz. when he dodges shaking his head a lot he gets dizzy and his feet get tangles up.
There is something very likeable about Andy Ruiz, simplicity, no pretense whatsoever, courage. When he got knocked down by AJ in the first fight, instead of being intimidated, Andy got up and went after AJ when AJ tried to finish Andy.  Met fire with fire, that was a boxing moment that went into history!👍
Andy can beat Uzyk
They are mean, ok.
Ruiz should fight looser of Wilder Fury match, to set up himself for title shot.
Go eat tacos so u can get lucky again
Bruhhh... Ruiz VS Ortiz would be Fireeee!
Apart of cheater camp
The only problem is that Joshua isn’t a good fighter 🤷🏽‍♂️ I’ve been telling people this looooong before Ruiz beat him. He’s just better than the bums who he’s fought up until Ruiz. Klitchko was older than dirt when they fought and Klitchko wasn’t good either. He ruled the weakest decade of heavyweight boxing history and people forget.
Andy is a good boxer I like watching him fight.
I like this messican I hope he wins again
👽👁️👁️🛸
I love the video length
Andy👍
Still humble  man I love this  guy.instead of  mocking  aj hes  just  being  himself.
Great man and boxer much respect
Ruiz is just happy in his life,
Let’s see Andy Ruiz vs Ortiz that would put him up in the ranking to be champ again
Gotta say i like andy hes a respectful humble person and a gud fighter too whos coming bk up for those top fighters and really can see him doing sum gud things again in not to far future  theres guna be sum gud fights and fans bk in the arenas too!!! From bidzy westmids Gypsy England 🥊🥊🇬🇧💯🙌👍👌
I think ruiz and Adam would be a great fight
Yeah, he was just waiting to be hit, he was vulnerable
I like Ruiz, he is a very classy guy
Dude looks like he's 12 froth kid from up ..would not dare say it to his face ..lol
Fight Dillian Whyte, I reckon you would beat him easily with your hand speed
I love watching ruiz throw his hands so beautiful
Either he bleached his teeth or got new dentures 🧐🤔😁
This guys 2 minute fame lasted long he ate to much pizzza
Andy “This is what I’ve been dreaming for” Ruiz  His five minutes of fame are long gone
AJ doe's not have the bad boy killer instinct any more,him being a huge man did not let his bombs go,when you know you cannot match the boxing skill's and speed of your opponent,that's when you let your bomb's go,try to knock him out or get knocked out trying, your gonna lose the fight anyway.He needs to sack his trainer ASAP.
I still think Andy sold out that 2nd fight.
Call on Big Baby
In honest reality this guy aj just hasn't been the same since the ass whooping ruiz gave him. .
He should fight Joe Joyce or Daniel Dubois
Ruiz Usyk is gonna be a good fight and I put Ruiz to win
Come on ruiz get in shape pls. We need to see some real fights and ur the man. Love from 🇦🇱
So hard not to be a fan of Andy. He seems like such a nice genuine dude. And a hell of a boxer
Joshua lost more from boredom. Hearn is over protecting him. JOshua wants Fury or Wilder yesterday.
Gotta love this guy!!
Wow, the knee op gave Ruiz babyface looks and shiny, white Hollywood teeth! (or, was that his AJ fight purse!?)😁 Lol, jk, he's great!💯😊
Respect Andy for you💪💪👊🙏🏼never gif up!!!
This is the face of the man who made AJ an ordinary fighter 😒.
I love his honest opinions...very humble guy.
Ruiz beats Usyk easily.
He didn't run around when you too fought. Ring is limited space. You were VERY out of shape, and all you had was a punchers chance, which he didn't give to you. Called effective movement.
Why ppl surprised andy not being a dick? He’s a cool guy, always has been
He reminds of that kid on stranger things.
Respect to you Andy Ruiz, you showed the blue print to get up and put it on him, hope you get back in the ring soon Bro and your looking good salute to you and your team 🙏🥊
Andy you are a real man respect from Serbia 🇷🇸!!!!!!!!!
🌹
Hes deffo had his teeth done...nice interview though
After Usyk, I'm not so sure AJ would take it vs AR 3
he was trying to protect those new teeth from aeriola. I like ruiz deseptivley quick
AJ is and always will be over rated glad he loss because it just shows there is nothing special about him
I'd love to see Ruiz vs Ortiz or even Martin!
Geez how can you not love Andy? Such a genuine guy! Look forward to his next fight!
…… why did he call him the heavyweight champion of the world 🤦🏿‍♂️
‘I thought they could’ve done better’ Says the guy who changed his accent after beating AJ and then came in 3 stone overweight for the rematch?
Decent guy
Andy "he dint fight like that with me" no shit you showed out of shape making it real easy on Aj on the second fight. Usyk showed up in shape with head movement angles a real technician not the same.
Who really cares what Ruiz thinks
Joshua chin and heart is suspect he really wanted to quit. But I think Joshua is a rematch type of guy he only wants to beat guys who beat him already I’ve said a lot the names on Joshua resume aren’t all that some guys aged and some to young for a.j but I think he does better in rematch
my mind is focused in getting those belts back.   Andy 2021
Ruiz is a man, I love the way he talks, he says “I feel blessed” he never spoke down on anybody
Ruiz is cool af he just thankful for everything he’s been given and worked for
Andy top man. Got he’s place in history. Love him. 🤗
Losing 8-2 on score cards what shall ya do carry on same tactics or change, we all know
AJ has to do what Dell boy done, just go for it and have loads of head movement just copy Usyk ducking diving leaning on him light on ya feet and loads of movement so Uysk can’t connect and score play him at his own game be quicker and sharper pump the jab out cut him up break his spirit that’s the only way and train flat out for 5 min 15 rounds so there’s no stamina issues even lose a bit more weight
Andy took a couple of good shots from AJ and he still got up and came back to win that a true champ !
New teeth
This guy doesn't even take boxing seriously. Dude has no credibility.Got lucky With a awkward high on the head shot that hurt Joshua. Came back a fat out of shape slob in the rematch. Was given a gift of a decision against Arreola. Back to b-level irrelevant status.
Great man great boxer.
Andy I like the guy just get rid of the belly man.
I just want to see Andy Ruiz beat Usyk and become champion again. 😌
No one thinks Andy is a scrub, he just didn't have the discipline of a HOFer.
Ruiz should fight Whyte, Parker, Hunter or Rivas.
Kill em with kindness Andy👍
I love your humility and respect for other boxers
Damn heavyweight is getting more and more interesting
Andy is such a humble guy. It shows that he has a good character and integrity not to rub AJ's loss to Usyk in his face. Good job. And he'll go far in boxing and in life with this type of attitude!
Right now he's just come out of surgery and ended up with a set of teeth that red rum would be proud of 🙈🤣🤣
Real shit AJ bs he the best fighter but he fight fo the money he lose on purpose
take dillan whyte
If he’d beat AJ the second time AJ literally wouldn’t have a career anymore…Joshua should’ve been exposed long ago by Fury or Wilder.
Those new teeth don’t suite him. 🤣🤣
He’s got it spot on Joshua had to options  go beseark and go for the ko or stay on the outside get the jab out and clinch when he gets close but he seemed to be flat footed just outside the pocket which made it easy for usyk to close the distance and move off
Ruiz should step up and fight another top 10 or up and comer. Kownacki , Martin and Ortiz would make sense.
Onwards and 'UP'wards
Andy spoke so well- he knows that the heavyweight division is wide open now and he stands a great chance for another title fight. This gentleman has the hand speed and fortitude to go 12 rounds in each fight. A real warrior. I wish him the best
He should fight AJ again and end him for good
He should shave and change his nick name to the baby face assassin
Ruiz is my favorite heavyweight right now. Can't remember when I've been this excited about the heavyweight division.
I like ruiz hes a great boxer .....he could beat them all ......but then theres the big gk   king of the heavyweight boxing world    ....nobody beats tyson fury
Great guy, just like Usyk. They let their craft do the talking and don't fall for the dis show. Fight in the ring, not outside. Respect! :)
The man has media skills👍
Rob set him up 🤦🏽‍♂️ Joshua is gonna be as useful as a fart is to the wind in the rematch
Taco-ruiz !
That was very kind from Andy ,it s the first time i see him talking and he seems very nice guy
Do not fight Ortiz. Man, two guys with your styles is like a coin toss.
Andy looks like he is staying fit. Good for him and for boxing.
Andyyy ijolesss este bato si trae más boxeos que fury ,wilder ya valioooooo madre…
He speak so politely ,like it😁
This man Andy seems like a classy kind of guy. A true champion!
He’s so mature now after his big film Up!
Ruiz just seems like such a nice bloke 👍
Andy very humble guy he’s could of shit it on AJ on his performance but he’s didn’t , les go champ
Love you Andy. All the best for you
If you wasn’t such an idiot Andy with the partying and weight gain ,  I have no doubt you would have beaten AJ in the rematch
He should probably have a tuneup before facing Luis Ortiz.
Have you heard, we're gonna eat turd
classy Andy!
Is there anyone who counted how many times did McCracken shout brilliant to AJ, including the moments when he was getting battered?
He's a good guy. There should be Ruiz Joshua III.
Ruiz style would do well again Usyk.
Great dude
I don't think he'd beat Luis Ortiz
All Iv seen the past few days is how AJ didn’t look right and AJ this, AJ that. How AJ is “done” and how he’s just an overrated champ. Iv only seen a few people actually acknowledge how good Usyk is. Aj is not overrated or a bad boxer, Usyk is underrated and a GREAT boxer.
he looks like matured actually. good to see him being wiser and calmer.
I didnt know he could speak english
Andy Ruiz, champion of the world intro?
Andy vs Dillian would be great
Joshua is an overrated fighter its been proven
Fantastic man .He don’t talk shit about  other fighters.Loosing is part of the game.Big UP Andy wish you the best 👊🏼✊🏿👍
Andy is very underrated. I believe he is very much a threat in the Heavyweight division. Got to control his culinary tendencies and got to get the right opponents. Actually, Fury is probably the only guy I think he should avoid. At least until he can make mega bucks taking the “L”. Just too damn big WITH superb boxing skills.
Andy is the most down to earth guy that's why I like him
I’d like to see Ruiz Jr fighting some of the other top British heavyweights. Joyce, Dubois, Whyte. Not an old man like Ortiz
With out a doubt Andy has very low self if steem. He is so worried about what people  think about his body image He doesent want the  camera to film him from the chichis down.  He is so traumatized by his body,  My man don't worry about that crap thats some  dumb crap as long as your healthy.
Great dude, and his English has got top notch!
Ruiz you exposed AJ, he will never be the same again.
AJ underestimated Usyk like he did Ruiz the first time.  We'll see if AJ can recover, but props to Ruiz for being a stand up guy.  For someone that has beaten AJ, even he was shocked AJ didn't look as good as he did in their 2nd fight.  I want Ruiz to get a shot at other heavyweights, and he definitely should get his hands on Wilder or Fury or even Whyte; Whyte/Ruiz would be great as both love to throw hands!
Aj is good when he's hitting a still target   different story whe the target moves quick verry quick
hes like the nicest dude.... that can also kick the shit out of you.. ever
Such a chill dude.
Very lovable guy
Top guy Such a nice man
"cant blame trainer" Didnt this guy lowkey blame his trainer by firing him after loosing to AJ 2nd match or am i remembering wrong?
That's cos usyk isn't as fat as fuck and Joshua couldn't run away
Ruiz,a heavy weight champ who I like to be pal with,and Mike Tyson too..to not get beaten up😁 👍❤️
He is finally back in shape after gaining 75pounds when he held the belts lol Sure would be awesome to see him knock everyone out. Please don't fight Tyson Fury though Andy, I have pure respect and love for you man Tyson can't be touched for atleast another 6-7 years
I love his face whenever he's got a camera on him, like a little kid who's nervous.
Na, it's time for Joshua to move forward with a new coach
hes the former heavyweight champion lol
Andy never took anything from AJ, AJ is just willing to take chances and fight top guys. Ali did the same and lost
Руиз єто мешок с руками.
Luis ortiz will be a hell of a challenge
Haha, Fury v Wilder ain't 50/50!!!
We haven't seen the last of big Andy......
AJ made enough money according to Eddie Hearn so he might as well retire since his heart and mind is no longer in boxing...
Come on Andy.... Even a snicker bar eating 7th rated lazy heavyweight fighter like you who ate yourself out of a career world champion fight knocked out "Glass Jaw" Joshua....
Man this guys put Joshua to shame his interview always sound too cocky and arrogant …
Respect to Andy
Former 🤔
This man is still undefeated in my books. He and Tyson fury are the best heavyweights around
Ruiz vs Usyk-Next fight!
Honest speaking ruiz
I think ruiz on his best condition would beat usik, but ruiz has to prove that he has grown up!
If Usyk Vs. Andy goes down, that will be heavy weight bout of the year. I see fireworks with these 2.
Andy Ruiz is a really tough guy.
ANDY & LUIS ORTIZ WOULD BE CRAZY 🔥🔥
Seams like the kind of guy you could get stupid drunk with. 🍻
Nice dude is Andy Ruiz
Was heavy champion no longer is get it right
such a chill guy : )
Nice guy, but him becoming champion in the first place was a fluke. I don't see him ever getting any belts back.
100% sure that this guy is going  to beat usyk  hands down
Ruiz is such a sweet heart in person yet a monster in the ring. I wish him the best Ruiz in top shape is dangerous
Andy took A J's confidence in that first fight.Up until then A J probably felt pretty bulletproof but all those knockdowns and that temple shot seems to have put a permanent dent in Joshua's appetite for battle.
Andy is such a sunny, bubbly and courteous champion-angel. God bless him.
Such a humble and polite spoken guy... Rarely says anything bad about anybody in the sport. "Ruiz you have my full respect lad"
Stay away from ortiz andy
I hope Ruiz loses the fat, gains a bit more muscle & gets back in business.
I click to watch a video of Andy Ruiz & I have an ad for burgers, everything fine so far.. No disrespect he's a great champ
He could have said Joshua was never the same after he knocked him out.
What a pleasant guy - fastest hands among the heavies?
Looks like he was about to say they gave him steroid injections for his knee, then had second thoughts and said they gave me medicines lol
Andy should have been given the trilogy with Overrated Antonio Joshua
GO Ruiz Usyk. That's interesting 😁
Andy Ruiz deserves more credit he’s a great boxer and destroyed AJ far better than usyk did!why all the sudden best boxer ever for usyk when this guy did it better? Maybe AJ will Come back and beat him and people will say it was a fluke like for Andy Ruiz! This guy is so humble and beautiful so is usyk and it’s nice to see the good guys win for once!
Everyone likes Andy, seems a really decent bloke
I love Ruiz hes such a good man
I think the loss to Ruiz had a huge impact on the USYK fight making him afraid of taking shots.
Fat boy beat Joshua well in the first fight, but then was a disgrace in the rematch as he never trained and took it seriously, thus allowing Joshua to box very cautiously to a win.
Great to see this gentleman in good spirits! 👊💪
Do like Ruiz Nice geeza Just hope he doesn't have no drugs from RENEYSO REMEDY PHARMACY BUTCHERS NEXT DOOR
Looks like a nice fella.
You ain't focused on nothing but easy fights. Nobody is going to respect you if you fight charles Martin over Ortiz
Ruiz looks like a pixar character
All his friends he was partying with when he had the Belt are all gone now… Lesson learnt🤦🏽‍♂️
Andy is a bum period! He Lacks respect for the boxing 🥊 profession. He is indiscipline and disgrace to the sports! You can’t eat your cake and have it mate.
Evidently , you weren't thinking bout the same person
respect to Ruiz , he was pretty solid about AJ I respect that.
Ruiz would probably knock usyk out
The potential to be heavy weight champion again without doubt
get the decider with joshua
Good dude. Sounds like a very nice guy.
Fight with Adam Kownacki would be great to watch!
Damn he is so humble and kind Andy is a really really great guy
The No1 Mexican heavyweight champion      .. El Rey Gitanos
man i love andy, hope to see him fight soon
He became the heavyweight champion how did he not get another chance right after his loss..
Humble fella, if only he could stop inhaling sausages.
Has this guy got a new set of teeth lol
Speaks like a angel, fights like a demon
AJ now want to be three time champion, but its rare of rarest n even doesn't sound cool as two time.
Ruiz Is genuinely a good guy .
I think its a waist of any top level fightrs time to fight Charles Martins given his disgraceful title defence against Joshua lol. I wrekon Ruiz should be fighting the likes of dillian whyte or even povetkin they should give him a busy night for sure.
Ruiz is not going to blame AJ for not being " ready"...when Ruiz was so insanely overweight for his rematch with AJ.
Why did this man not get a trilogy ???
This guy is the main reason he lost.
Whyte vs Ruiz would be something I'd pay to see.
Ruiz seems so nice. what genuinely cool guy
Andy Ruiz has know AJ tactics after the second fight with AJ
What a nice guy.
I met Andy Ruiz on a flight the day after his fight against Tor Hamer back in 2013. He was super nice and very affable. He was sitting in economy back then and was entertaining everyone around him. He said, "One day, I'll be the Heavyweight Champ." He wasn't lying.
The Federal Reserve is a conflict of interest.
Hard Work Really Payz Off!
Funny how he's scared about being operated on the meniscus but not afraid to get in the ring with heavyweight behemoths.
Sometimes these fights looked planned because he wasn't letting his hands go but it's real though. Happy for USYK!
He reminds me of Russell from UP
Andy Ruiz is the People's Champion. Accountability, Discipline, Integrity, Honest, Humility.
Since Ruiz beat AJ up he’s not been the same. Mr Ruiz you’ve mentally scared AJ and it’s not getting any better for him!
Any Ruiz heavyweight champion of the world…are you guys stupid or thick like 2 planks of wood
AJ is a Boxer. He is no Fighter. He is Warrior. He should fire his Team. Ruiz is a Fighter. Usyk is a Fighter. Fury is a Fighter. Wilder is a Fighter. ....AJ is Just A Popstar with Muscels.
Ruiz-joshua should be next
Nice guy with positive attitude
If you don’t love this guy, you’re a waste of space.
No you're wrong, there are no more opportunities, there are less-Yet another rematch. Joe Joyce beat Daniel Dubois was promise a title shot   and hasn't fought since.
Son tullos ESOS sintorones Andy Ruiz be a entrenar en El serro de la sima go geret tiger 🐅
You can tell he is a man of God !
Who else thought he was wearing gumshield those teeth too white
How have 66 people 👎 this video, Andy ruiz Jr is a quality bloke and always polite and courteous towards people, nothing wrong with this interview at all and no reason for the dislike
Ruiz such a humble dude, hope he gets another shot at the title...
Happy dude Andy 👍👍👍
Top man Andy, so humble, can't wait for your next fight bro, need that title fight leesss get it
Very nice man so humble
Joshua 'fell asleep' that happens to athletes especially in boxing when it seems like the person is suffering from some type of mental block.. .check out what happened to Pacquiao vs Ugas, Pacquiao couldn't make his usual moves, his brain couldn't dictate the action, his legs 'gave up' on him and so he got hit a lot. The condition is actually 'mental fatigue' which stops alertness, awareness, and focus dead on its tracks.
The guy who has changed AJ forever.
Didn't ruiz blame his trainer and sack him?
Well that was a surprise. I never realised what a decent polite young man Andy Ruiz is. For a bloke that earns his living punching people in the head , he is a real gentleman. Let’s hope he gets fit & back in the ring soon. 👍👍
I seriously wonder what qualifies Andy Ruiz for comment.
Like Ruiz great guy good boxer , hes got a good Amateur record and I think he should fight wilder who I think gets beat again off Fury, I think Ruiz beats wilder
As far as I can see AJ used the same strategy he used against the Ruiz rematch. That was for a fairly immobile overweight man. For Usyk who is naturally lighter and faster, and without that truly devestating heavyweight power, I think AJ should have used his superior strength and size to bully Usyk and get the KO.
Always a great respectful guy Andy.Love to see him get another grap at them belts.
hes on PED or sumthing he seems to friendly 🤔
This is the guy who ruined Anthony Joshua’s career.. he destroyed his mindset and it might never be same again
Set match
You didn't take responsibility,  you blamed KFC
Good bloke.  I wish him well.
Can’t not love this guy aye . And man can he throw them thangs .
How can you not love Andy Ruiz!
You were to heavy in your second fight and yes he ran around.  I like you as a boxer but I think Hearns bought you from aj. Why would you lose that fight.  Or gain that much weight.  I think you got power and hands but I think 244is your weight for power and speed.
Those teeth 😂
Ruiz lost the second fight but he has left joshua scared after the first bout.  Joshua doesn’t want to engage and fight. You Dont box a superior boxer with 350 amateur fights, you make it rough and dirty and lay on him. But again maybe it was usyk who didn’t allowed him to do that.  Usyk used to spar with klitschko brothers and he know every bit and grit of how to fight a bigger man plus his iq and mentality is second to nun.  Overall what a great fight , i have watched the dazn highlights almost 4-5 times after watching it live.   A fully prepared andy can beat joshua if the trilogy happens.
Such a honest comment...big up Ruiz
Man heavyweight is booming right now.
Usyk vs Ruiz a must..... Different styles... Wud be a great match
Why don't he correct him he is not the heavy weight champion
🤣 this guy has no chance of ever getting that belt of Usyk. Usyk would dismantle and demolish this guys
Ruiz vs Usyk.....fight i bet Usyk will win ......
What a humble gentleman "a credit to boxers" its a shame others within the heavy weight division  aren't as respectful !!!
Keep the weight bro we need that guy,combined wide da sweet science, just makes sense
Once again, barely any credit to Usyk! It's all what Aj didn't do 🙄 In the rematch, Usyk will be MUCH BETTER! He's now adjusting to being a proper heavyweight! He's back training this Saturday! He's not like Ruiz who enjoyed being a superstar! Usyk wants to be undisputed heavyweight champion! He WILL achieve that goal and y'all doubters will STILL have excuses 😂🥊🇺🇦
I have very high hope for ANdy Ruiz to win WBC. His style is best. Like if you accept.
Sumo wrestling awaits this guy once he retires from boxing. With his particular daily diet making 500-600 pounds shouldn't be an issue.
I still consider Ruiz basically top 3 Heavyweights in the world
Luis Ortiz please, not those other guys
Usyk is better cause he is white #respect
Fury wilder 50/50 i dont agree Fury will destroy all of em
Ruiz is a realy nice guy
AJ has been lost since he lost to Ruiz. AJ has got to beat his demons, and that means he needs to actually beat Ruiz, not run around for 12 rounds.
He had his chance, won, lost.... Andy is probably well down the peaking order now, not sure he would get any title shots
Ruiz could pose serious problem for usyk with his fast hand and come forward sit on your chest style and ability to effectively stay in the pocket. However, he doesn't have the footwork that Usyk has and the Mexican style can be very open to traps which the Ukrainian is a master at setting
Get back in shape? 🤣 Have you ever been in shape?
Very nice guy
Usyk vs Ruiz would be a great fight!!
Humility is before greatness, and that's Andy Ruiz. I like him a lot. Class Act! It's funny I like a lot of these guys including fury and AJ. I do respect Usyk. I hoped AJ would win but that's how it goes. I'm a huge fan of Andy Ruiz.
very nice and cool guy ...
All the latinos back on the band wagon
Seems a nice guy ..
A fit and keen Ruiz always beats AJ. But where are you Andy? You need to get fighting again.
This guy is nice. Well brought up
Why he call him the heavyweight champ tho? Lol
Andy is the illegal alien living rent free in AJs head.
Nicest looking heavyweight in the world
Ruiz looks so adorable and chill. All the best man.
Imagine a fight between Usyk and Andy... Usyk would set up a boxing clinic.
I never wanna hear anything Ruiz have to say I commented during commercials
Give this talented fighter a big title shot he been excercising his ass off is in mint condition again no more excuses boxibg commission give andy the fight he deserves winner out wilder3 or Usyk
Get the belts back once and for all
See the new ink work Andy looks badasss fam rest up so u can get back in the ring and kick some major asss
Ruiz vs Usyk is what we want to c Andy can defeat him he is the best of the best right behind iron Mike Tyson this is the mexican Rocky
Ruiz/Joshua need a Rocky 3 style training montage
which belts?
Andy is great guy, let him have a serious fight, he deserves it.
Ruiz vs. Whyte would be a good fight.
He used the same style he used against Ruiz in the 2nd fight which makes no sense cuz Ruiz can't move like Usyk smh
His strategy for your 2nd fight was to wait for you to get fat…
Hard not to like this dude 🤙🏼
i really like Ruiz
Yes Joshua lose his 2nd fight but only Andy Ruiz knock him out. Power and heart wasn’t enough for Joshua vs Ruiz 2 , but now Ruiz has legs to chase those runners! .
hes a humble man and great boxer
Ruiz vs Wilder next please..
Andy vs Luis!!! 👍
check this out the trilogy .andy tells joshua.i am your father!!!!like starwars
Everyone is in on this acting like they Didnt know that the fight was fixed its fake he took a dive for money just like most of these fights are same as the NBA and the NFL, MMA...  PEOPLE NEED TO WAKE UP!
praying for a trilogy
get them belts bro!
wheres the blingbling?
torn maniskis.oh no!!!whats the maniskis?
Look what he said though he said they're blaming Joshua's coach and asking him to change that's the first thing he did he gave up his coach when he lost and it was all him drinking and letting that money get to his head
Getting those belts back? Focus on getting at least one. Make sure you make it known you're a champion by winning your fights without a doubt because so far it's not looking too good, and it should because now you have the best team Canelo.
It's too bad Andy got lazy and ate himself out of tens of millions of dollars. Hope it was worth it.
This is what we do know, neither Ruiz nor AJ will ever be champ. Never again. The elite standard is beyond both of them now. When we say elite, that means 1,2 & 3. Even when you compare the differences between USYK Wilder & Fury, the difference in levels between Usyk & Fury may as well be light years. No matter how technically good, Usyk can't do squat to Fury. You would think that AJ would make like the same, but that literally isn't the case. AJ should have won that fight. Could have won, should win the rematch by ko, but will he? Don't bet on that, as he lost so dismally last time. Too slow. Nowhere near enough finesse.
i like Andy, i can't wait to see him fight again as i will be supporting all his fights. Go get them Andy
Andy just a very humble dude 💪
Good on Andy for realizing he needs to correct the mistakes he made in the Arreola fight...all that new footwork training was evident at times but he lapsed back to his usual awkwardness style footwork when he could least afford it and got caught. He looks fresher than I've ever seen him , amazing what a no nonsense gym can achieve but I can't see him having a title shot till 2023 as there is too much going on for the foreseeable 18mths , if he's content with that knowledge and sticks with the discipline being instilled upon him he'll be a formidable opponent for anyone in the top ranks.
Fight Joe Joyce you barney
Andy is fat. He came in heavier in the second Joshua fight. He is finished
Ruiz biggest cheese out in heavyweight history.
Too heavy. Knees won't take it anymore if you do not lose at least 30 pounds.
Damn does his face look slimmer ? Or is this just what we want to see. ARJ let's get it done baby !!! VAAAmOOOSSSS
Nice Easter egg with the 4:20 mark
Andy cool guy but an assissin...
This guy vs usyk by a million miles the best fight for both? before the rematch! andys speed and power vs technique and grit fluidity etc of usyk? I have Andy by KO, but usyk is the man! he pulled it off so far! otherwise? tyson furyyyy! gypsy king is the one and only champ for this time in history and him vs usyk??? no chance!?? tysons to big, to clever and to strong etc... he'll slaughter him! Tyson should beat Anthony up, then fight ruiz and usyk at the same time!!! with his right hand in his pocket wearing gysy pants after downing a keg of beer! at thirty stone! on Christmas day! 2022!
keep busy Andy we want to see you in the ring
you are on that stuff to Ruiz so shut up
This guy I like holifield said he good
Soon to be 2x World Heavyweight Champion! I like each of the potential matchups he named. Luis Ortiz is by far my favorite! That would go down as a classic among the greatest fights of all!
Wreck ortiz please
Can't wait for the Parker rematch  🇲🇽 🇲🇽
Kugan sounds different here
Ruiz-Uzyk would be a really good fight.
1:20 Exactly the whole world saw he was sacred to be counted
AR looks solid Can’t wait for his next match
🚨sorry bro, your Dr. finessed you! You’re never “100%” after ANY knee surgery! 🤷‍♂️🚨
Love this guy. Speaks from the heart.
Dam Charles Martin aint retire yet?
Who's AndyRuiz next fight👊👊👊👊👊
Andy probably was a bully at some point lol,he seems to be a very sweet guy,I'm sure he is,but he probably was a bully at some point in his life.But I can be wrong.
Is that a big ass HERPE on his upper lip ??
Next usyk vs ruiz game on
That big O happy meal smile makes me wana smile. It’s a shame they easily forgot he knocked down AJ 3 times and gave him a concussion.
Lmao I know why you're smiling Ruiz but if you want the belts back you're gonna have to train for Usyk now
Such a humble dude. Hope he gets back at it and becomes champ again.
them teeth tho g'damn
He sounds alot smarter lol he had alot less to say before .
The Fat Man has spoken
Now he can get that 3 fight but i think he be a perfect opponent for usyk it be a great fight 2 fast hand HW
Usky vs Andy Ruiz.
It’s nice to hear a realistic HW with a realistic plan to climb back to world title level.  Not calling out the champs, but talking about a solid 3-4 fight plan.
Povetkin would be a a good option, more so that Ortiz imo
This man took aj chin since he got beat buy Andy he ant been the same
Andy a one-man wrecking crew - love watching Andy in the ring. -Like a cat.  Even when you know he-has-it he still surprises you.  Hands come out of nowhere.
Andy seems such a nice guy but can't honestly see him ever getting the belts back again think that ship has sailed.
Andy made my dream came true. I always wanted to have the body of world champion!!!!
great sprit respect andy!
Re simpatico Andy
You embarrassed all your fans you got lucky with Joshua
Good guy , Andy is .
Love this guy great ambassador for boxing
Usyk v Ruiz 🤔🥊
Hows this guy so chilled after all them performance enhancers
Honestly Ruiz vs Joshua 3 seems like the perfect fight rn. Because tbh Joshua doesn’t beat Usyk or Fury
That need title eliminator type fights in hw! Ruiz, AJ, Fury, Wilder and Usk! But boxing is messed up to do it! If this was UFC they would fight
Hey Andy, get a fight with Usyk, I think you can beat him.
Andy need more fights.
Would love to see him fight Ortiz.
Andy lost the eye of the tiger
PREDICTION!! LOOK AT RUIZ FACE! HES A BABY! IM 40 NOW I DEVELOPED IN MY EARLY 30'S HES GONNA TAKE OVER THE DIVISION! I THINK HIS ABILITY IS DEEEEEPPPP! IF HE COULD FIGHT LIKE THAT, AS OUT OF SHAPE AS HES BEEN! NO TELLIUN WHAT HE DOES WHEN HE DEVELOPES,,,,THATS IF HE GETS AND STAYS IN SHAPE, IMAGINE HOW FAST HED BE THEN?..... SCARY!  ANDY, IF YOU READ THIS? I SAY THIS WITH LOVE AND RESPECT, I THINK YOUR MORE GIFTED THEN ALL OF THESE HEAVYWEIGHTS! GET RIPPED AND WATCH WHAT YOU DO IN THIS DIVISION! IM NOT A GAMBLER, BUT ID BET THE HOUSE ON YOU @ 212 LBS AND IN CRAZY SHAPE... THIS IS A FACT!
Ruiz vs Ortiz in December!!!🤩
Ruiz would smash Usyk.
There’s something about Andy he’s special. Really respectful and genuine
He needs to take his fat ass some place and sit down andy is a joke of a fighter but he is a great guy
Also, he sounds like Jack Black
Andy Ruiz, I surely love his optimism and I can see he is a complete gentleman
Respect
Ruiz v Whyte 😐😐
Run the fight back with parker i reckon that would b a good fight since parker kickd ur arse in the 1st fight andy
Ruiz makes excuses hes just more soft spoken . I don't see him ever winning a title back
He's lost a lot of weight since he started training with Canelo.  Ppl notice AJ didn't look like he was throwing his jab hard?
Ruiz vs Whyte should get made.
This guy is respectful and well mannered.
Always classy
I feel like Ruiz really lost steam and hype. He lost all the weight, got with one of the best trainers’, had a ton of buzz, and then it all went away after his fight with Arreola. That fight was his moment to shine and make a big splash. Unfortunate.
Ruiz is a really cool guy, and very respectful. I wouldn’t think any less of him if he cussed McCracken and Joshua’s crap strategy, because it was. Joshua could do well to see out the rest of his career with Kronk or other elite boxing gym, at least well away from the clueless McCracken camp.
The man who sacked his trainer after a loss telling us that you can't blame a loss on the trainer! Comical
Que se calle y siga entrenando si quiere ser protagonista nuevamente
Andy was that happy Mexican kid that stares at you in public then asks "hey you got any games on your phone?"
Ruiz vs Ortiz is wassup
You are good Boxer.speed up your hand and every matches ko! 😀 Good luck! / From HUNGARY? / HÚNGARO
This man changed Joshua, he's afraid to exchange in hope he don't get TKO'd.
Literally why are you still fat. If you took your rematch with Joshua seriously maybe you would still have the belts...
What the hell is that freakish tattoo of a face on AR's right clavicle  area ???
Nice guy 🇦🇺
Ruiz seems like he’s back on the grind
Ever since Andy beat him aj been not the same
This guy since being humbled I really hope he gets the belts back fr ♥️🔥🔥
God bless Andy top bloke 🙏🙏
NEVER DISCLOSE AN INJURY!!!!!
Finally some fucking update from this Mexican 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Andy Ruiz x Luis Ortiz would be great! Make it guys.
Andy is the nicest, classiest active boxer right now.  No shit talking, confident humility, 100% positive & respecful towards his fellow fighters & the fans.  Just a class act, & a helluva good boxer.
Fast hands..talks a good game but lazy and little discipline for eating the right foods.
Andy’s gaining it back
Wilder will win on points
If this Ruiz gets focused he can be an absolute threat in the HW division
andy would destroy usyk strong chin fast hands and heavy hands at least heavy enough for usyk.
I can't be the only one here who thinks Ruiz vs Ortiz would be a banger. No way that fight goes the distance
Love this guy, always a smile, down to earth, very humble and a good sense of humor when he says....  "I'm getting back in shape now" 😂😂👊
Such a likable and respectful champ. The first Mexican HW champion.
Really good fighter and really nice bloke 👍🏻
Andy Ruiz one of the most dangerous fighters with natural pure talent..
I wanna see Andy vs Oritiz or Andy vs Whyte
Andy proved he's the real deal with a stunning 256 entrance and excellent win last time. Now, a win over a solid Top 10 guy (again, 260 is the idea here) and I will need to see Andy get the titles back vs.. well.. whoever the hell is left standing as champ.
I low key want to see Usyk/Ruiz. Style makes fight!
Thanks ruiz bro, i appreciate you. You are still a good fighter. Both of you and joshua are my favourite fighters, thanks good luck.
ANDY RUIZ TOOK SOMETHING OUT OF AJ : SUFFERING ALL THOSE KNOCKDOWNS DURING THERE 1ST FIGHT IS PLAYING ON JOSHUA'S MENTALITY
RUIZ VS UZYK RUIZ TAKES THE BELTS FROM HIM N MAKES THE 3RD FIGHT WITH AJ 4 THE BELTS AGAIN 😲
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha title shot
Anyone remember when this tomatoe can won a fight?
Great guy.
Luis Ortiz would be a good fight
Want to see Ruiz get a rematch with Parker.
I was at MSG when Ruiz won the title. that was a great night.
Ruiz vs Usyk, A good fight
I feel like something was up with AJ
I don't know Andy Ruiz of course , but he seems like a very likable , nice young man . I'd like to see him get another shot at the title. GO DESTROYER!!
All that money and Andy has those jailhouse fucking tattoos on his body he needs to stop letting his fucking homey‘s tattoo him that shit is horrible 🤣😂
Fluffy getting them tacos 🌮 in stomach again lol
Love to see Ruiz Ortiz
Nice guy is Andy....
OMG! Si he fought AJ w/ an MCL injury? whow!
I still cant believe how lazy he got after being champ....such a waste.
Aj is all about the money now first it was the belts but bad men got there claws into him so it's money money now
It was a Brilliant fight
ANDY RUIZ volverá a ser Campeón mundial tiene todo para HACERLO
Andy vs Ortiz? The most technical fire fight you’d see in the Heavyweight division.
Canelo vs Usyk definitely a good fight? Why not If Canelo move up weight & Usyk to come down to agreeable level.
Who the hell is this Mexican dude
No way he needs a tune up fight to fight Luis Ortiz
Andy seems like a great guy .. Like to see him do well .
This man is the reason why AJ has lost it.
You gotta love Andy. He’s respectful towards every fighter, but you gotta believe he’s kicking himself in the ass after see usyk dominate AJ. It should’ve been him but he ate himself to defeat. No doubt he’s championship material but it’s a shame he even has to take dangerous fights to get back on top.  He looks like he’s learned his lesson though.
The only boxer who is able to beat usyk is Ruiz . I'm sur of that
AJ got a glass jaw and Ruiz is the one who exposed it
This gays is not rud like the older generation,,ALI.......
Andy is a good dude
This guy is pretty humble and chilled ..!! May he be blessed 🙏🏾
Este broder perdió la oportunidad de su vida por no entrenar bien cuando era necesario.
He needs to stay away from the tea and the meat for sure I actually enjoy watching his fights.
Goodluck Andy
I love this guy
Reckon Andy Ruiz takes it to Usyk... I’m sure Usyk can just box him but I feel like Andy Ruiz has that style to bewilder people
Well spoken by Andy Ruiz
This is such a nice dude. You definitely feel there’s a lot more respect for other fighters at the top in the heavyweight division. Even Fury and Wilder respected each other before the last fight. You don’t see as much of this in the other divisions. Big ups Andy 💪🏻
Andy, Joshua and Usyk.........class acts.
Chum Lee from pawn stars
Luis Ortiz is like 40 years old lol why not fight someone who’s actually going to be a challenge
What a nice guy and a true sportsman
I like this new humble Ruiz.
Good luck Andy
1st Mexican heritage boxer to  become World Heavyweight champion....yes   am sure u made your Parents proud and your Country proud of you....looking forward to your next fight
Andy Ruiz would now beat both Usyk & AJ I’m sure of it.
Ruiz is a gentleman, humble and respectful.
Cannot wait to see him fight. Class act!!!
This man is genuinely happy. Gotta love it.
Can't wait for AR-15 to get Back in the Hunt for another Shot @ the Title...AR-15 is Top 5 Heavyweight...💥🥊🇲🇽🥊💥
Andy Ruiz has already made history once by Winning title's Anthony Joshua had and hes not even bitter talkin about him....Now that's what you call a Champ ... This is how Mexicans do it....Respect Andy Ruiz Junior....
Ruiz has broken AJs spirit. He is terrified of getting hit ever since.
Andy Ruiz is so modest. Everyone knows Joshua has never been the same (mentally) since Andy connected with the left hook
Whomever Ruiz fights next, he's put himself in the position that he's going to have to go through White in order to get a chance to get those belts back.
I don’t wanna see him fight the likes of Ortiz I feel andys above that maybe a Joyce fight someone with a better ranking although Ruiz is a risky fight
The fighter is now too big for the trainer. My point of view only
In first aj fight this guy was ready and ruined aj forever . Second fight Andy not in shape aj run for his life couldn’t even knock Andy out . It’s 1-1 they have to run that back for trilogy . Aj don’t want that smoke at all !!! In shape Andy is a problem !!
Fury vs Wilder III is 50-50?
Joshua would win a rematch with Usyk just like he did with Ruiz, Joshua is a boxer you have to force to fight he needs killer instinct
If Andy Ruiz wouldn’t of eaten a full horse before the second fight with AJ he might still be the champion now !
Ruiz vs White would be a sweet 🤔
I wanna see Ruiz vs Usyk
Ruiz' looking great 💪
Same aj will rematch ang win again
No it's more like 80/20 Fury wins, Wilder only has a puncher's chance & Fury is to smart for Wilder. I really miss the 80's & 90's boxing, just alot more quality boxer's. 👊🇺🇲🗽🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👊
He's already got the belts, he needs the titles.
Doesn't carry himself like a tattooed boxer. I'm confused.
Respect!
"they always win the rematch by running and grabbing to beat you by points"  pretty much
Ruiz gave AJ ptsd
Cant wait for ruiz to get back. Fast hands for a big guy. Wish him all the best 🇬🇧
Nice humble guy👍👍👍👍
Great fighter and nice guy 👍🏾 🥊
Would like to see u box in Britain. big from Scotland 👍.
...usyk and ruiz would be a good fight...for late next year...
Ruiz has so much potential it’s a shame he isn’t more disciplined
Ruiz would be a much harder fight for Usyk than AJ was, Ruiz is strong, a big puncher , rock solid chin and has much faster hands than AJ
still a fair n nice humble taco lover Andy.  Respect
How is this guy fighting a tune up for ahother tuneup, he becoming the new wildernfighting bums
A true  gentleman  very  respectful
Met Andy on a few occasions and he’s just as humble in person as he was in this interview. Very kind dude
Ruiz looks in a good place. Good luck to him, seems like a really good guy.
Ruiz vs Ortiz is the fight
You win some and you lose some. Usyk was a better fighter that night. Next fight could be different and will be more competitive. Andy hopefully you will fight for title again. Two time baby!!!
Ruiz is really cool decent guy who can be loved by milloins of fans
Andy Ruiz is legit a nice guy
Behold I saw a skilled Andy take his belts and then witness a ill Ruiz or it could've  been a pale horse give them back and all of Mars candy company followed with him
Some people might not like me for saying this lol but I do think ruiz can beat usyk. And wilder vs fury 3 gonna be exciting!
AJ makes money by loosing boxers whose name not heard of. AJ give fame to his opponents by loosing first then beat them and hit the jackpot. That is what happened AJ vs Ruiz, and AJ vs Uysk. AJ is disgrace of boxing sport.
Ever heard the saying "Sun shines on a dogs ass sometimes"?> \Your looking at the visual definition of it.
Good man, Andy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why Is it nobody in America can pronounce usyk name correctly? It's Pronounced ood-sick like OO in Wood
Andy ruiz,gentlemen though & though.
Why do they open with Andy Ruiz heavyweight champ of the world when he ain’t champ
love this guy!
Usyk is a highly skilled in shape version of Ruiz. There was no way AJ could box with Usyk.
"It was surprisingly" I stopped watching. Listening to American boxers talk is like tires screeching, him and Wilder need English lessons.
At least AJ wasn't beat by a dinner plate. And with all due respect to Andy shouldn't he be focusing on why he lost and not why Anthony lost. Cuz I'll guarantee you all usyk is going to keep that belt as long as Andy Ruiz did. Worst thing you want to do with Anthony is showing how to beat you and make him mad. 😂 and everyone bad-mouthing him again is making him mad, and usyk has already given him the blueprint of how he fights. When Andy Ruiz gets another belt and he can start telling world champions what to do. Until then he is the former heavyweight world champion because of 1 fight with AJ. Anthony Joshua earned every single one of those belts the hard way and is the former two-time world champion and will be the new three time world champion. I guarantee it
What a stand up guy. Positive vibes for you. Would love to see you in another title fight. Hand speed and apparently one of the hardest hitters according to Parker
Andy no disrespect I had you winning the 1st fight have always been a fan, with that said you had more to do with AJ looking good in the 2nd fight than anything AJ did won a bunch on 1st and out my ass on 2nd based on those leaked reports how good of shape Ruiz was in 🙂😉😀😃😁😆🥰😅
Andy ruiz  I like you but the reason aj didn't move around as much and box on the outside was because usyk aint a overweight man with slow legs .
AJ has lost faith in his chin
AJ boxed Ruiz easily because he was a 300 pound obese who couldn't throw more than two punches and couldn't carry his own weight in that second fight. Usyk has exceptional footwork, speed, boxing IQ, etc. Joshua tried to not get hit, tried to outbox Usyk but came short because Usyk is a better boxer, simple as that. It was a mistake for Joshua to try to outbox the most skilled fighter in the division, his only chance of winning is risking it, go for it, he could catch Usyk and knock him out, or get knocked out himself with counters(Usyk could also make him miss get him tired and then knock him out).
I like Ruiz and wouldn’t mind seeing him be champ again. But I don’t see anyway he beats Fury. Very unlikely he beats Usyk, and even a prepared Joshua. I do see him pressuring Wilder and winning that
Teeth
The Bigger Andy with more discipline and Training would have beat all the Heavyweights!
"Im pretty sure that..."  About to say fury will win then Realises hes signed deals with same people as wilder... " its a 50 50 fight " 😅😅
I love me some Ruiz..so respectful and that's not usually the case from certain camps towards black fighters.
Strong Boxer and very humble . God bless
Scary tattoo just below neck! Don't look there 🤡
The first man to expose Joshua as mediocre. Come back soon.
He showed tremendous heart to get up and beat Joshua, I hope he can win a few more fights and get into the title mix
🌮🌯🍕🍟🍔🍨🍦🥧🍰🎂🧁🍭🍬🍫🍩🍪
Love this guy! Wish nothing but the best for him! How could DAZN rank Whyte over Andy? Lol
Kowanski or Robert Helinus would be good fights for Ruiz, needs those tough opponents.
I like Andy, but i do think Usyk would beat him. 1. Fury 2. Usyk 3. Ruiz 4. AJ 5. Wilder
Another humble boxer, we are getting spoilt....l hope he does well 👍
Such a great Champion
Ruiz would smash Usyk to bits with his formula n style
wasn't surprising at all, to me.
Joshua gave him a shot and made him a lifetime fortune and fame. Set him up for life. He can’t say anything bad, he respects him.
Ruiz then: AJ i want a third fight! Ruiz now: Oh never mind man.
The robe did Joshua in after wearing that weight his legs were gone and the game had changed 😁
Nice guy Andy 👌💯
4:20 ok no problem ;d
I still can't believe he beat AJ. Lol @ him getting back into shape.
AJ missing shots BRILLIANT JOSHUA!
AJ's loss just made Ruiz look even worse. You were outboxed by a guy who just got outboxed!
I'm not sure if you could take Ortiz. If Luis Ortiz was around 30 to 33 years old he would be the undisputed King of the heavyweight division. Wilder is lucky he beat him
He’s a good guy!
new teeth bro
ruiz vs usyk is a nice fight - good clash of styles.
ANDY RUIZ VS CHARLES MARTIN OR LUIZ ORTIZ AT DECEMBER
OLEXANDR USYK IS DIFFICULT OPPONENTS FOR JOSHUA THAN ANDY RUIZ
Likeable dude, always humble!!!
Ruiz is dangerous for anyone in the division if he knuckles down and stays focused, he's deceptively quick and has big power.
the more i see him the more i think he simply got lucky with AJ in their first match
I cant wait for the trilogy fight with ruiz and aj i just want to no who’s the better boxer out of the two
The nicest bloke in heavyweight
Ruiz vs Hunter would be a good fight
damn Ruiz is cute baby bear😍😎
He should try for dillian whyte
Andy is a good guy. I sure hope he becomes champion again
Ruiz beats usyk very easy
Good v bad...andy v wilder........ Big up ruiz  love ya chilled persona
This is your best chance Andy  to challenge and fight Usik , you Will knockout Usik , because Usik is not and his figthing style ( usik)  favors your style as well.
Man is still eating his snickers 😂
LEGENDARY
Hurry up back Andy ur 1 ov me favs, an I know u cud give any ov the top 3 a scare and even more mayb, bri from uk
Those teeth look mad weird
Hoping to see you win mate ☺️😊
Don't like ruiz at all, the way he acted after he beat the racist AJ was a disgrace, he didn't even train for the 2nd fight 🇬🇧👎🇬🇧
Jake Paul would sleep Ruiz, AJ and Usyk in a consecutive match one after the other
We need to hear a real fighter worth the salt speak, when will you get Jake Paul on here to analyze the match and give some actual real expert input and commentary?
Lol lmaooo it’s your fault he like this lol
I do have to give credit to Andy for not taking the opportunity to rub it in. He's a good dude.
This is the nicest guy in the world i want to put him in my pocket x
I'm happy Ruiz isn't bitter and talking shit about AJ, he's respectful and unbiased. Massive respect.
He's so nice.
Andy took Ajs chakraa smh never been the same after
Joshua has no confidence since he thought Ruiz he had more reach than usky heavy and taller and still lost he need to brawl usky like chrisora did
Such a nice fella Andy Ruiz
Dude just seems so nice.
Joshua fought kind of like Andy Ruiz Jr. fought against him, just a bad night.
I like Andy Ruiz so much.  Top guy 👍🏻🇬🇧
They all love to mention Luis Ortiz but they end up not facing him
Fuerza Ruiz from Colombia .
It’s a shame you didn’t take responsibility of your 2nd loss to AJ and sacked your coach you hypocrite
Ruiz took something from Ajay that he never got back.
Andy "I only diet when I'm sleeping" Ruiz.
Everyone needs to stop putting wilder in the top 3/4 bracket, if you’re a boxing fan and you watched the usyk vs Joshua fight and didn’t recognise the boxing ability/skill gap that was showcased that night then just stay out the comments haha… wilder boxing ability is absolutely abysmal, literally the only thing he has is a right hand. When fury beats him again on sat I just hope he gets the recognition he deserves, of how terrible he actually is.
Torn meniscus shit that’s a serious injury
Dillion white
That night at MSG will never happen again
id pay twice to see ruiz vs Usik,that wud be a helluva  barnburner.All six of RUIZ fast arms & Usik doing the moving Matrix.
Andy is such a great guy and boxer.
I didn't want to like this guy but I love him, the way he talks and carries himself.
I BETTER SEE A TWO PACK IN YOUR NEXT FIGHT ANDY
AHHH TYPICAL MEN KNOCKING EACHOTHER SENELESS 🙄
I like Ruiz man he’s a decent guy, shame he didn’t win the second with aj but like he said he ain’t making the same mistakes twice. Good to see him come back
Boy is a real life kungfoo panda lol !!😂
En español Andy o te pongo un achinga
seeing him so chilled out and optimistic makes me happy, hope to see him back in the ring soon
Why is fatty laughing ? He got his ass beat by AJ
He would never get them belts again 😔 he fuq that package up
Every fighter has to take responsibility for themselves? You fired your trainer Andy....
That smile at the beginning of the video, you could literally feel it.
Andy RUIZ JR is the only one that can beat Usyk. Andy RUIZ JR speed will destroy USYK. Andy RUIZ JR VS USYK let's make it happen. And let's see real boxing
The truth is Ruiz took AJs  bottle and smashed it to smithereens!!!!!!!!
Lmaooooo Joshua don’t give af anymore that nigga done got the bag got hella endorsements he don’t give a shit anymore he don’t need this
Ruiz Biggest Mistake Is Leaving Manny Robles, He Hasn’t Realized That He Made The Mistake In The Rematch Not His Trainer. Ruiz Got Lucky & Hasn’t Fought World Class Boxers Since He Loss. If Ruiz Believes He Can Beat Usyk He Needs To Challenge A Southpaw Like Luis Ortiz 1st
Hope to see him back on top soon!
Andy if only you trained and entered the ring looking like your sponsored by under armour in stead of Burger King you would of got the win still upsets me how u let that chance blow away
andy is such a nice guy
Awesome guy
Ruiz is good but he not beating Ortiz that's not happening
Andy Ruiz sounds like an awesome dude, down to earth🤔cool
Ruiz vs Whyte
These fighters wild corny these days
It’s mad too think Andy is only missing one belt on the wall also
We know why AJ didn’t want wilder . Because unlike Fury he has no heart
Aerola Rematch first then , 🥊make it with Wilder . That’s what the real Boxing fans want 🥊
Aj learnt from the ruiz fight that he can lose first fight win second fight get paid twice best mafs on earf
Andy's such a great guy, but man he frustrates me. He was the unified Heavyweight champion of the world and the first Mexican HW champ. How do you not train and get even fatter for the Joshua rematch? Honestly I'd rather see other guys get the opportunity for a title shot before him.
>.> 50 50 fight against wilder, DOUBT
Former Champion.
I lost my respect to ruiz he was a better fighter with weight why not fight king kong ortiz i think he will loose to ortiz
Love this guy...cool cat...
keep puttin in work the HW division is any mans game
It’s quite annoying that ufc fighters can fight every few months but boxers only three times a year if your lucky. Promoters are ruining everything. There’s like 10 different fighters that haven’t fought in ages that I want to see again.
I think Andy could take out Dillion White,that will be a good fight!
Ironic how Andy and Ryan are with defensive heavy Reynosos and their defense got worse and got dropped
I think Ruiz would lose to Usyk as well.
Ruiz if he's focused and in shape can beat Joshua again and maybe even Wilder.
Ruiz vs Kownacki and Ortiz are both great fights.
Pinche capulina del boxeo, no se aguite wey es carrilla de la buena! Arriba Mexico cab!....
Hey Andy can you give Joshua his Heart back?? He needs it.
Andy ruiz will get knocked out by joshua or wilder right now... he made a mistake losing that weight. Areola caused him problems... being fat 250lb is his natural weight believe it or not
All those photo shop photos he don't look like them🤣🤣🤣
Martin one would be interesting cuz of Martin's trainer that's if Robles still training him
Looks like Fat Andy is back. Hopefully he'll take punches better now.
Bro, you can trilogy him & easily ko AJ.
Andy should wilder after he loses to fury..would love to see that..Andy looking a lot better and HEALTHY.....
