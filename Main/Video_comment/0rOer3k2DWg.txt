I can't listen to this monster hit from one of Africa's best in the industry. Suffice it to say that: it's high time we changed the nomenclature - afro-hip-hop to afro--genre or afro-tainment.
The optimistic hope in there eyes is unbelievable
Nice
The question is still the same and they will never get an answer 💯

Burna boy all you had to do is to tell your fans that your timing is coming! Not hating on him and saying calm down I know how to deal with people like him. He deserved that award at that time just like you deserved it this time.Right now you can’t celebrate with a fellow legend because this song of yours where you let us all know that you didn’t accept his win! Love from Uganda 🇺🇬
Sooooooooooo cooooooloool
Very humble celeb
Don Jazzy, original Big Boy...Alaye.
🙌💙
🇨🇮 depuis la côte d'Ivoire ont te kiffe bravo à toi champions 🇨🇮
Mother children relationship is very important, but no one should ever mess with the FATHER CHILDREN RELATIONSHIP. We've seen people looking for their fathers wakiwa wakubwa na at times pia well off. They just want that FATHER FIGURE IN THEIR LIFE! You should see the older Egyptian baby when the Father is talking to him(kanainamisha hadi kichwa)  and a woman is talking to him. Another close example is my brothers, kuwaambia to "Nitakustaki kwa daddy!" is enough threat.
Can someone translate what the kids were saying for me please? Do Nigerians speak French as well? They go so hard with the English dialect that I forgot they speak different languages
when you go win grammy... hahahaha

This man's smile can light up the lowest heart.
That smile is everything ❤️🇯🇲
BIG UP BURNA from Jamaica... Burna use his platform for politics not just pop music and thats why i rate burna boy ! highlight the life of the common man
When I saw the problem in Metropol I didn't want to address it Based on my belief (protect the leaders nakedness) But I was told I had to. So I had to face it....right now, I'm in "another level " so when I try to avoid matters "religion" I have my own reasons. Nonetheless, I still respect it based from where I come from(we don't chose where to be born or race) and the positive role it has played in our society.
eeeii😍😍😍 government how are you FINE BOY😘
This man is gorgeous. Infectious smile! I'm in love!!

Love this song and video
Thank Don Jazzy
❤❤
Father of many nations 😂🤣😂🤣💋❣💯
They thought giving my brother custody of my son was doing me a favour. At least he is no longer property of the ministry. They don't own it - like the videos they used to feed me to frustrate and break me after they stole him. No! Not good enough. Won't do ever!  My son belongs to and WITH me. He was happy with me when you stole him and attacked and invaded my home.  Nothing but back with me will do.  WAR!
Question? Indeed. The moves have now become pathetic at this point. Classless!
So handsome ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Incroyable j'adore 🇨🇵
the song is wagwan💥🔥🔥

Burna boy is good and talented. I know this when I watched him on nprc tiny desk performance
Burna Boy,  this is a good piece of work. "Nigeria Youths are not lazy". They are working. Just that they have asked some" QUESTIONS" that answers were not provided because the "QUESTIONEE" did not know the answer. I listened to this song early this morning over the radio. When i got to the office today (07/07/2022) i repeatedly played this music and my colleagues wondered why i picked on this song. The rythm, the pitch and voice woke me up this morning and i can't stop playing it. Thank you Burna boy. Keep winning international grammy awards.
You have the kindest, nicest face I've ever seen. Someone who genuinely cares. I wish you as much success as a random Australian stranger could. Keep smiling, it lights up the world.
From 🇬🇼👌
I love booooorna boy🤗♥️

When I do my cannabis videos on my YouTube channel Catherine the Cannabis Connoisseur I use to listen to 70’s music in the background but now since I discovered Burna Boys music I play Afrobeats in the background. Love your music discovered your music 2 months ago and the concert at Madison Square Gardens OMG Awesome

I’m confused by the video. Why are there so many kiddos in the beginning and then it transitions to burning buildings, a dead body, and riches? I thought children represent innocence 🙄
I love this song
Burna boy is the most unique artists that I have ever seen in Africa. Great song.
That line with tomato and ketchup (homophone of "catch up") contains so much imagery, metaphor. Burna boy is so talented
Congratulation, high song 🇨🇲🙏🏿

Burna Boy...Look how much influence you have on the little ones with your talent.

You are too talented now to use those other distractions to get different types of audience!  You dont need it.  ❤

We go koukou say Don Jazzy be african DJ Khaled
Idole 🌹
This beat slaps hard
Sorry, I'm just just from a listening of Fela Kuti O.D.O.O. (overtake Don overtake overtake)[been binge playing Fela, lately, though] and all these so-called modern afrobeats just sound plastic to my hearing! I hope that is even normal, because, I thought these guys, especially burna, were actually doing great before. I now have to struggle against not expecting these gifted generation to do the impossible....play music like Fela, who himself is a god of music!
Basically, he has responded to Davido's { FEM }  2:33 where is your baby?  2:43  when you go win Grammy?
Burna Boy has such a beautiful smile
Love this man
If u dislike this masterpiece u be enemy walai. And insha Allah u go meet people way pass u for front🕺
burna stays in his own...lane..best lane ever

Pour les mauvais commentaire 🖕🖕🖕👎
Nobody can describe my love for burna boy and his music's 💪✋✋♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
He is the African Giant for reason.❤
okay let me say this, before watching the video... The audio brought me to tears, I was 8 years old when we migrated to America, Burna Boy and Don Jazzy managed to capture the essence of childhood back in the mid 90's/early 00's. I was screaming!! like did the sample daddy showkey??!!😭😍🥰🔥 This took me to Ikoyi Lagos mid 90's summer. Something about this track took me directly 8 year old Chi, when we looked up to people like Daddy Showkey the voice of the youth!!! To that torch being passed down to our generation while the babies now looking up to us🤯✨ MAAAAAAAN KEEP IT COMING!! NAIJA TO THE WORLD🇳🇬
DOPEEst Crazy Keep it simple Don The Trust
I love you I love you I love you I love you @Burnaboy and Don Jazzy................
❤️❤️❤️
And he say inshallah or whatever Arab word he said like a good Muslim maybe he just be like boko haram who think education is bad
Yoruba religion someone remove it Internet Shango is one of the worst so called Orisha he is very bad
Nobody be god
big love to you man from Morocco 🇲🇦 i think this song is because your house set on fire but our god is always helping us. hope you're visiting us someday why not doing you show love this music and specially "on the low" one thanks man
This song hits different wllh😭
Africa giant 🔥🔥🔥🔥⚠️
I want to be Don Jazzy in this case lol
💃🏽🎶🎵😊
And when you look at my name don’t be thinking I’m a superhero or something I’m ancestors of millions of Nigerians only Nigerians especially Yoruba’s
It's Burna's smile for me. 😊 Now let's put this on repeat ✌🏾
The Shango is just imagination of what people in superhero films with lightning we will us Africans stop thinking gods are real?
I had no idea there was a bomb!
Your are right Man no be god you should of said there is no god as-well Nigeria believe in many gods who are not tell that to your Yorúbà ancestors who worship Yoruba religion or outside who don’t know
All those beautiful babies 🔥😍
Love from Nepal

World star your songs are so particular and different and good beat ♥️♥️
Hit a like if this song is your best
This is a banger. Don Jazzy has joined in using the piano buzz to bring in color to the beats.  This song is a continuation of his beef with Davido. That's why he told Don Jazzy to spit the lines as a decoy for him. “I hear say you rugged” . He threw shade at his relationship with Chioma- “Wey you baby o”. He threw shade at his inability to win grammy- “when you go win grammy”.  The beef is getting personal and Don Jazzy don follow.
African king

Amazing 😍😍
The smile on these kids faces  captivating
🔥🔥🔥🔥. Am a musician from Ghana🇬🇭
This video reminds me a lot of memories in Africa:    The Good ones: Playing in the street with my old friends, playing with the ball, running without shoes going back home with dirty clothes and feet , lol! My mom was yelling at me « Again!? I don’t know what I’m going to do with you , stubborn !» 🤣. Taking shower outside, eating with hands in one big plate with friends ! Dammmnn childhood in Africa, was magical!   The Bad ones :  Seing your parents struggling every day to get money to buy foods, to pay your scholarship.  Even worst Not being able sometimes to sleep because of insecurity.   Well! Let’s stay positive and be greatful  There is beauty in poverty sometimes !  You enjoy what you have, you’re not complaining, you’re surrounded by your family and friends no matter what.   Thanks for this beautiful video!
2021 🇳🇦👏👏🔥🔥🔥 marked ✅

The explosion made me skip a heart beat because the music was on speakers and it was an alarm going off
If you like (haters )chop all the tomatoes, you no go fit ketchup (catch up) Favourite line😍😍😍
The "African child" the most happiest kids on the face of this planet! Even without nuthin their happiness is always genuine and infectious. First world kids have it all yet still self- mutilate or suicidal! True happiness can't be bought with ps5 or iPads etc
Burna fans where are you at?
Spiritual ✊🏿
We’re gonna be great!!

Burna boy: smiles   Me: fainting
As a Kenyan I can confidently say without any iota of doubt, ambivalence or double speak not persuaded by any indoctrinations bedeviling this space or any pre existing musical contraptions, I reiterate the obvious notable predominant incontrovertible and irrefutable subsisting notion concerning our sub conscious dalliance with African music is undeniable.
Love from Morocco ❤️
A wish I could be like you ☺️

This Track is so nice!!!
Jesus said that all we need for salvation is faith  in him; but what does this mean? Who is Jesus? He is the most sacrade of gods creation in heaven who paid our bail so we can be free; the only question is, will you choose to stay in prison or run free to salvation. He is the messenger of god whom is one with the father and the Holy Spirit. But we know Jesus by his word which is what he’s talking about here. So, live according to everything jesus taught and you will be saved from eternal damnation. Not to say you will not make mistakes, but god is loving, repent and he will forgive. Good luck brothers and sisters, I hope to see you all in the next life.  Amen

10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. Despite the cost of living, have you noticed how it remains so popular? 2. Save the whales. Collect the whole set. 3. A day without sunshine is like, night. 4. The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. 5. Corduroy pillows: They're making headlines! 6. Gravity: It's not just a good idea, it's the LAW! 7. Life is too complicated in the morning. 8. We are all part of the ultimate statistic -- ten out of ten die. 9. Nobody's perfect. I'm a nobody. 10. Ask me about my vow of silence.       Perhaps the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

Hey guys Jesus loves you  He wants you to come as you are He died for your sins past,present,and future. He was buried then rose again on the third day so you can be saved,so that you can have the free gift of Salvation.If you want God in your life just seek Him truly put your faith in Him and accept Him as your Lord and savior.It is by God’s grace you can be saved❤️‼️💝🙌🏾

I see 3 punch lines directed towards Davido.  but I may be wrong though...  The beef lines were...    And you no get level (meaning he has no influence to bring home d Grammy).    Where ur baby? (Chioma and Davido break up)    When you go win Grammy (Burna and Wiz has Grammy which means it was directed at Davido considering he is top 3 names Naija music with dis award).  make of it what u will...
Simply the Greatest of all time ❤️

Making the root better is the way forward
When una go win Grammy????..... questions
Jazzy costume was poor, seems he cut out jazzys part
Attitude aside, we cannot deny that Burna boy is the truth. Wizkid is nice but comparing him to this genius is unfair. His ability to make diverse songs as opposed to Wiz's one dimensional style of serenading the females is applaudable. Burna, I appreciate you.
Listening since it drop, I think i'm going to sleep with this song cause ano get the answer. Much love Burna.
Directed to davido  I hear say you rugged with ⚒ sign by Don jazzy and then where your baby oh(Where Chioma) then when you go win Grammy.  Lolz. Like you both.  No need for the beef. Burna and OBO 🙌
I love this!
The Don 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆☑️🔥❤️
I like this video , it’s different, more power to you , children is the future they need inspiration in a good way ,and you are doing it , I’m proud of you from America
Gangster burna

Don jazzzzz,i remove cap for u here,this song is tge real life of an african boy life,
I am going to say this everyday until the Lord raptures the body of Christ for it is our responsibility to be a shofar and warn the habitants of the earth! If the Lord can send me to YouTube to open a channel to be a voice in theses end times, then know the hour is near! Yahushua HaMashiach Jesus the Messiah loves the body of Christ so much! He doesn't want to see anyone perish. Woe to lukewarm Christians. Turn away from iniquity! I will shout this everyday until the Lord returns! I do not want blood on my hands! MARANATHA 🔥✝️ Shalom beloved 🙏❤️
