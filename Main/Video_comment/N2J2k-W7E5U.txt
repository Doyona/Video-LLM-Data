Who do you want to see in the next episode of  Go To Bed With Me? ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️
I LOOOOVE James ❤
My favorite skincare YouTuber ❤
Great job James! ❤
I find it interesting to hear that he says that there used to be a lot of make up trends, and now there's a bunch of skincare trends. I used to see make-up mostly as a way to cover up your face and all its imperfections. Now that good quality skincare is available and the knowledge is being spread, the quality of your skin improves, thus reducing the need for high coverage foundations.   OBVIOUSLY some people really just enjoy the high glam, high coverage look! And that's fine! I just feel like a lot of us use make up for creativity now and no longer to really hide.
Thank you again for sharing your expertise
just rinse your face, put on one serum and one moisturizer and stop wasting your money. give the money you save to the needy.
my fave 🤍
No way!!! This is so exciting to see😭😭❤️
Yay james. ✨ skin care 101
I love how knowledgeable he is and can cover the topics that are relevant. I neeeever knew my face would need certain types of products on 1 part more than others. It makes sense!
i love it here
He izz just obsessed w cosrx n me either😊
I am trying so hard to had more shiny and pretty skin. I barely use make up (my skin isn't problematic), just hydrating  and cleaning it and trying to understand the need of my skin better. But I still want better and better skin
Nil 💅 god is it for gents or you are???????
I’m only 24 but it’s one of my pet peeves when someone in they’re 30’s talks as If they’re ancient.. lol does this annoy anyone else??
YAAAY loved to see James here!!! Robert's next!
Jesus loves you.
How did I not know James did this?
I have used most of the products you use. My skin type has a different structure than most skin types. I wish it could work on my skin. Some products were good for my acne, but after a while it started to have no effect. I have an oily skin. However, I have been using a cream called RWLMAX for 4 months. It cleared up almost all the pimples on my face. This is like a miracle for me. The instructions for use are a little different than other creams, but they are easy. I really can't believe it made such an impact in 4 months. I would definitely recommend going to their website and checking it out.
COSRX GOTTA LOVE HIM
💓💓💓
I love this man so much. So happy for him to do this
Next,Cassandra Bankson
James!!! 👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉❤️❤️❤️
I love him sm😭😭😭 u go James!!!
<3 James!!!
James is such a panty dropper
Finally!!!
Best go to bed with me, thank you Harper bazaar for this gem 💎💎💎
I did it with Weedborn CBD products!
It always baffles me to see the so called skin experts completely avoiding to wash and treat their neck...
I can’t believe you didn’t use your rice toner. 😂 I need to get one of those reusable masks before winter
💜💜💜
Goddess Hecate, please light the torch necessary so that he sees this comment.  Gurl, could you help me out? When I finish my routine, I have a slight gloss on my forehead and nose. What can I do to remove the shininess?  Blessed be, Chris
I tried these many steps to skincare before and it only damages my skin in the long run. It also becomes more sensitive. So now I only wash my face with soap, sprinkle with floral water and put non comedogenic oil on in the evening. And I only splash some water on my face in the morning. I do it about twice a week. Usually it’s only water that I use on my face. Works wonders. Remember that when you put so much on your skin, especially if it has “anti ageing” ingredients or any acids (hyaluronic etc.), it makes your body stop produce your own and instead rely on the product. Which is great for the manufacturer, but not you
Well Cerave is not cheap anymore. I went to get a moisturizer that I have been using forever and found out its now 30$😕 I remember buying it for 12 dollars when no one knew knew about them
When you watch James Welsh, you always learn something new and helpful. Thanks.
We have the same skin type, but I'm "poor",  so my skin is both dry and oily at the same time if that makes any sense😅 I just use whatever I can afford, most of it doesn't fit my skin type I guess🙄
Great video great tips ❤
Omg I use that moisturizer!! Yesssss. I’m doing something right! 😍😍
10:11 wdym that glow, your skin was already glowing from the getgo
How do we get the krave cleanser if we live in the U.K.??
Very happy to see James on here! This was amazing! Congratulations!
You deserve it!!
yes jamesssss
U see how other skincare influencers and fans positively cheer comments here... skincare community❤️
James should react to his own skincare routine.
Thankyou so much harper's bazaar for having james.... i love him
He is soo good looking and nice... his voice is sooo soothing... i love the way he tals about products
Skin goals!!!
James has such a soothing voice
they did him dirty on that thumbnail
Yay!
The ceaseless parallelogram relevantly skip because star individually trick inside a flaky hub. gaping, cluttered mailbox
Would LOVE to see Charlotte Parler soon!
Omg why I am I only seeing this now?!?! Love James ❤️❤️❤️
Has Hyram reacted to this yet?🤓😂🤣
Wait.... does James still live in the UK? If so how did he get the hemp matcha cleanser? I'm so jealous 😫
Guy is an idiot and proponent of snake oil. 1 hour for skincare. All those products. All you need is a vitamin c+e, suncream, (both for the morning; then tretinoin, and a basic moisturiser and a single cleanser to use maybe once at night. Cheap. Quick. Simple. Good compliance. Double cleanser is for women with makeup. A lot of hyper neurotic homosexual men on youtube seem to think they are women. Finally I am the same age as him, and have MUCH MUCH MUCH better skin + looks younger. You've got to remember he's in good lighting and a bit away from the camera - he has uneven skin tone, texture issues, some wrinkling (you can't quite see with the lighting, but I can see he does when I look closely) and quite a bit of acne. Putting a lot of products and messing about with his skin is part of the problem.
This is the only video i care about today
Por qué nadie me avisó que existía este video?!
OMG how did I not know this happened! 😱 I love James his content. Congratulations James, you deserve it ❤️
Glad to see Deviant skincare getting a mention, such an underrated brand.
I have oily skin + very sensitive I never use  makeup .... I  need cleansing balm or not???
Please get shawn mendes to do this 🙌🏻
❤️❤️❤️
omg i’m so happy for him 🤍🤍 !!
I adore james welsh 💜💜💖💖
Congratulations James so happy for you ❤️👌🏽
Do you guys think you need a separate cleanser like a oil or balm to remove sunscreen or could you just cleanse twice with one cleanser
FINALLYYYYY
krave beauty and that dual bottle cosrx thingy still not available in my contry :")
I LOVE the fact that he was conscious about putting his hair back before he begins his skincare routine. I have seen so many other youtubers neglect that step and will wash their face with bangs down and all???? Their hair gets wet and all other their face and it makes me cringe. How are people comfortable with rubbing hair product all over their face?
My least favorite among the skin care gurus 🤪
This is who we needed!!
YES DEVIANT IS THE BEST BRAND EVER
Congrats woo hooooo
THE WAY SKINFLUENCERS ARE HAPPY FOR HIM JUST MADE MY DAY.
OMGGG BABESSS
I have a weird question. First, when I do my nightly routine, if I press my moisture into my eye area I ALWAYS wake up with puffy eyes and bags. Yes, I’m 40 years old, but if I tap a smaller amount it doesn’t puff up. My skin has turned nasty dry in the last year and a half. So, my question is do I really need to get an eye cream to resolve this issue? Nasty dry or nasty puffy😢🤷🏼‍♀️😭
OMG ITS JAMESSS
Giving me Patrick bateman vibes!
Is that a face or a bulb that glow is BLINDING ✨✨✨
why does he look a lot like avan jogia
Can we...leave snails out of our skincare in 2021 please :/ Tf
It was easier before when I thought there was just one of you 😂 now when a video pop up I never know who is of you
So if you are using suncream every day, than you should necessarily  double cleans?😳   I thought double cleansing is for those days when you're wearing makeup.
omg !!! ATLAST !!! about time!!
YES!!!! The prince of skincare, been waiting for this one!!!!!! Love James!
the fact that his face was glowing even before his routine— 😳😳
Really want to try the Krave match cleanser but it's $75 to get in on amazon :( doesnt ship to Canada through Krave site
His skin is shinning like a crystal ball.
Ohhhh yes James! Finally 😍
🤔 no retinol?
Jaaameesssss. I'm so late. I love this 😍 Yaaasss 🙌🏻
I've always wanted to go to bed with James Welsh.
So happy to see James here
Are we going to talk about how James takes his skincare down to his nipples? No? OK.
I love all of the messages that James is sending! Preaching skinimalism and sticking with what works for you is everything
Your nails are gorgeous x

Please please please try some A-Beauty! The Go-To, bangbody, frank body, LA Clinica, Aséop, Jurlique, Kevin Murphy and ere Perez! The price point is amazing, and I’m not seeing many international ppl looking at A-Beauty!
What a great choice to have selected James Welsh!  His genuine, knowledgeable, real life philosophy and perspective on skincare is refreshing to see.  Even to the older crowd - I’m a big fan at 52.
If you use only one good moisturizer then his skin still going to look same. And what's the point of damping face every time . Just wasting product. Smdh
I thought he is more into makeup . Now everyone is jumping on skin care bandwagon.
So happy to see James on here! He’s perfect for this series with his chill vibes and voice. So happy to see him getting recognition he deserves ❤️❤️❤️
James, you are my favourite YouTuber ever. I've learned so much from your videos as noone dermatologist had been told me. My skin now is in it's best condition so far and all because of your advices. Please keep me yourself and continue to provide us with such useful content! Love you! 💜💜💜
Congratulations, James.

YASSSSSSS JAMESSS !

I so agree with the dugstore comment, I was like that for awhile but I've been mixing in drugstore products in my routine and I find e.l.f is doing a good job with some products, specifically the happy hydration moisturizer

Absolutely he is most lovable and charming person 🙌 i ever seen on YouTube.  Loads of love .
Im so happy for james! Been his subscriber when he still has 120k subscribers. I feel like a proud mother 😭😭😭
I’d love to see Liah Yooh! 💜
Congratulations 🥰🥰
James staying true to his love for cosrx..🥰
The fact that the skincare lines he’s been using are all affordable 🥰
I stopped using Corsx when I discovered that snail mucin is the substance that snails secrete when they’re under extreme stress. They get mucin by force feeding snails salt water. There are better cruelty free options for basic moisturiser ingredient.
*WE DID IT — okay Cassandra next, internet do your job again!*
Omg..finally..it happened 😍
OHMYGOD FINALLLYYYYYY!!! BEEN WAITING HERE FOR A LONG TIMEEE!!!
Can i do oil cleansing eveyday and for how many minutes i should do ? I have an oily skin with all prblms . Lol

James,girl,really?!?!Never seen dermatologist?!?!OMG! Girl! Dermatologist practically saved me tonne of money and following their advice I have no wrinkles been 50 years young!?They can correct your routine and adjust it with ingredients.
It was about time Bazaar had this awesome man
Can we just talk about the 💅 . He always has black done but I have a feeling he had a professional manicure done for this special occasion 😁👏🏾👏🏾they look great James!
Thanks to James i started to use COSRX products half a year ago. My skin couldn't be happier!
So happy and proud to this guy! 🤍
I thought the beginning was the post skincare routine look #thatglowup
This is happening! ❤️🥺✨
Sorry mate it must be a girl
SCREAMING!!!!! Love it!
Are we going to talk about how James takes his skincare down to his nipples? No? OK.

Celebrating your accomplishments now and always - I hope more people find out how amazing you and Robert are from this video. Xoxo from the U.S.A.
It's about timmmmmeeeee! ♥
Finally James love him ❤
ICONIC!!!! I'm so happy for you❤❤❤
Omg been waiting for you to be featured here
👏James 💜 Well done video 💜
Very well deserved and long overdue. Congratulations James. I just think there was too much of Cosrx in there, though as long time fans we know James love Cosrx, but could have switched brand for one of those products essence(Neogen/Missha), serum (glow recipe) and moisturiser. But it is just my opinion. Way to go man, more success and power to you :)
I just want to comment 😊😊
JAMES OH MY GOD CONGRATS YESSSS
Seeing James finally making it here after Susane and hyram just made my day ❤

I don't get why so much layering and massaging, It basically blends everything and you have one film of milion products and you don't know  how it affects all the formulas.
Thank you for showing us your routine. I learned a lot. For example,  that I can use two serums! I always alternate my serums.  James, did you see the thing o sent you on Instagram about the Hylouronic Essence by Hanskin? I think you would love it. I believe I sen you an Amazon link
Yeaaaaa

YASSSS!!!!!! Been waiting for this 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Dr Dray pleaseeeeee
James and Hyram are the only reasons for me coming to this channel. I don’t care about the celebrities, I just care about them. Also, they are the only ones who actually give legit advice. And good advice! They really know their stuff. Everyone should listen to them.
Happy for you James ✨✨✨
YESSSSS!! Finally!!!!!!
So exited for you James, Congrats!! Huge accomplishment
YASSS JAMESSSS♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
Yessss finally!!
Finallyyy!
Ya’ll need to do Dr Dray. She does her routine on her page but putting her in this platform can educate more people.   Shes my YouTube fave. To her, yes skincare is selfcare without the useless hype plus a huge dollop of PubMed references:
YAAAAYYY JAMES!!!!!!
Drop everything. The moment has arrived. James is changing the whole conversation to be about skin types and what works for the individual. It's about being gentle on your skin to help it be as healthy as it can be, not using a bunch of expensive products or thumbnail-clickbait DIY exfoliators. It's common-sense skin-care. James has had a huge impact on how I treat my skin and this is an incredibly well-deserved moment of recognition for them.
Yes!!!!
Congrats James. We are so proud!!!!!!!!!! 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Chefs 💋
YESSS 😍😍😍😍
Omg JAMES 🥺😍 👏🏽
Yessssssss I’m so proud!!!
I💛him
So excited to see James on here!🤗
Omg clicked so fast!
gasp!! finally!
IM SO PROUD OF JAMES 😭💕
Fragrance  James welsh: i'm not against them actually Hyram: if i can ban one thing..i will ban fragrance Cassandra bankson: umm...fragrance is not the worst thing in the world if u don't have sensitive skin
Yay! Congrats, James! 🎉🎊🥳
oMG OMG @Hyram we need ur reaction to this 😍
Yay! Congratulations James Welsh! So happy for you.
Gigi Hadid please♥️ and Taylor Swift (who never ages🥺) and Harry Styles
I hate to mention it but that silicone mask is meant  to be worn over a sheet mask (to push in the ingredients) and not meant to be worn on it's own. It is at times like this you realise the difference between a skincare "enthusiast" like James, and a skincare expert.
Oh snap.... Get it James
YES YES YES
YESSSS i love James!!! so glad you made a video with him! DO A SERIES WITH HIM🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 so many people would watch!!!
YESSS HARPER'S BAZAAR! YOU LISTENED TO US
OMG JAMES!!! ❤️❤️
Is that Cosrx moisturizer really thick?  Looking for a really good winter skin care cream. Gets dry in Colorado in the winter!  Sweet chef has a great one but looking for something thicker. Idw to break out tho!  Thx
hyraam pleaaase react to this x
I just bought the cleansing balm thank you !  @James Welsh
Ahhh James!!!
Finallyyyyyy
Cameron Diaz or Jessica Chastain  or Michael B. Jordan 💞
Finally! :D
we love skin care influencers having the spotlight 🥺❤️❤️
🤍🤍
Oh my gosh this is so exciting!! I’m so happy for you James 🤩
Well deserved!
I'll say this, Proactiv, which is benzoyl peroxide based, made my skin worse, where I developed cysts, so I started using Clean and Clear Advantage, salicylic acid, never looked back. However, my very Irisb grandmother never taught me anything other than "I got a face lift at 40", but my other Native American grandmother drilled using spf in me since childhood.
Congratulations James on your GTBWM debut! Much deserved.
The derms in uk are still the same...don't recommend anything for brown spots!
U learn a lot w h ole getting a facial.
Omggggggg I’m so excited! This was long overdue! Good on you HB! Congrats James, you sexy beast! ❤️
Omg!!!! So happy to see you featured James ❤️

About time! Congrats James  <3  So happy for you
Hi im just worried that your skin will lose its ability to monitor and itself if one over uses products esp at night. Have you heard about Dr. Hauschka's philosophy? He said that one should use min products at night because your skin will get lazy...i think haha
Omg this is fabulous! Congrats James 💛💛
YESS FINALLY WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!
About time!
OMG THIS WAS OVERDUE YES JAMES
Yesss 🙌🏽 love James 💜💜💜🌙🌙🌙

i love this sm congrats james very well deserved 🥰🥰
It is soooooo ridiculous!!!! All you need is a good Vitamin C Serum and simple Moisturizer. Oh, Jesus !!!!!!!!     All those products is a weekly Salary for some People. People suffer from Covid Job loss and you introduce stupid costly Products. Oh, God bless you.... 😘😘😘😘
I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS 🤩🤩 Congratulations James, you deserve it!!
Thank you Harper Bazaar! Love him
Yayyy i love you james
I’m so happy for you James ! I’m going to watch this over and over again 😍
Oh Dear, all those Products have soooo many Oils in them. Very bad. One Cream you used has Coconut Oil in it -- it clogs up the pores so badly. 😘😘😘😘♥️♥️♥️♥️😘😘😘😘
Oh God. What a beautiful person. Love his voice, his routine. ❤️ Will just listen again and again... Congrats to James!!

OMGGGGG IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU JAMES !!! i literally squealed when i saw this on my homepage ;_;
OMG IM SO HAPPY! I’ve been waiting for this video! James is a legenddddddd
I'm the same way with my esthetician, she has to tell me each product that she's using just in case I have a reaction later then I know that it had to be something that she used.
Yes james congrats
Ahhh!❤ He made it!
Never freaked out soo much as much as I did seeing James on here !!! Cannot wait for his buddy Hyram to react!!
His routine is one of the best I’ve ever seen!
💜💜
One of my top 2 favorite YouTube resources for skincare and has been for years now!! 💜 People — if you’re not already following him, you really should! Have gotten so many valuable and informative tips and bluntly honest reviews and recs from him over the years! Congrats, James! 👏
Omgggggggg 😍✨
OMG! Im so happy for you James! ✨🥰
I got a lil emotional when I saw James made it to Harper's bazaar. Absolute icon

He uses several products with similar functions and interchangeable ingredients, looks totally unnecessary, but he probably has fun with it. I know I'd have fun with it.

YESS FINALLY
Definitely here for James!! Congrats on the feature 👏🏻🙋🏼‍♀️
You are the physical manifestation of coolness ☯️🖤💜🖤 I can listen to your voice for so long 🎧
YAY!!! THE LIVING, BREATHING LEGEND WHO LIVES AND BREATHES SKINCARE GETS HIS DAY!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Loved it, James! You nailed it! Love the reusable mask and when you were scandalized by forgetting to mention your skin type. Side note: Facials for me we're unthinkable because I used to pick my skin, but I healed from that with help from people like you and now facials are so satisfying cuz I ask her really informed questions, feel validated or learn something new, and feel f*cking great afterwards because another skincare maniac is pampering me.
FINALLY!!! 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Giving the people what they want!
