Tsimikas in this game🔥🔥🔥
Crazy that a benfica player was called “Everton” and was playing at anfield 😂
This match described Nunez perfectly
"Looks offside to me" I don't know who was more blind Martin Keown or the linesman
0:52 it says 1-0 but then 0:55 it says 0-0
He certainly knows where the back of the net is 😂😂😅tell that to him now 😂
Bayern with Vertonghen?
0:50 Bayern did very well there
0:50 Bayern?
Why is there so much offsides and checks …
That was the game where I think Liverpool decided to buy Nunez and they did.
Imagine Firmino kicking Salah when he scored his second
Two of the worst commentators in hte land, worse than female commenatators, hard to listen to
The commentary that Nunez was playing like it was an audition for a top club couldn't have been more prophetic.
0:51 - BT predicted Liverpool would go 1-0 up it seems.  Also, this seems to be the game that made them move for Nunez (I believe they were monitoring him anyway, though).
Darwin Núñez is pretty good I hope he joins Liverpool some day
7:50
Brilliant signing by Liverpool of Diaz(Porto), Carvalho(Fulham) & now Nunez(Benfica)
That Nunez guy could be a good player for Liverpool i think we should get him
Watching this back since we signed nunez now for liverpool
Nunez is now a Liverpool player. Who’s watching this to check him out?
Klopp had a good look at Nunez on this performance...and his mind was made up to sign him and Liverpool  knew in January  that mane was leaving in the summer
We're in the semi finals of the CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
0:51 liverpool scored 1?
Martin Keown MUST be removed for all comms from now on
No wonder there buying him
Who’s here to watch Nunez after hearing he could be a Liverpool player.
Welcome to Nunez watch
Firmino and Kostas need more game time there world class
This was probably the most boring 3-3 game ever
Nunes to Liverpool
This Benfica team knocked out Ajax (who topped their group) and pushed Liverpool. They must be a really good side
7:32 that FIFA glich 😂😂😂
0:52 Liverpool score randomly goes up
Yoo half of the match was offside like come on they could’ve had a comeback
The bias on these English commentators
Big move is waiting for Nuñez. He just keeps on scoring and it doesn't matter if he's onside or offside. Villarreal won't beat LFC. Easy two games for Brits.
lol commentator got it wrong twice on offside , so obvious both benifcas goals where onside
This partide for Benfica was against Referee and Liverpool
Martin Keown calling an onside goal rightly given as 'stunning'!  🤣
I'm sorry Liverpool isn't getting a quadruple
7:46 Great play from Salah, he should have taken the shot himself here. He's getting back to his best self.
Never thought I would see liverpool play a weakened team in the champions league quarters
Liverpool seems on course.....
Insane how many var checks some record
“looked a tad offside” He looked miles on
Fair play to Benfica they acc gave Liverpool two good games which I never thought they would do👏🏾👏🏾as a United fan I wouldn’t mind seeing Nunez playing for us next season he’s a proper threat something we desperately need up front these days ffs🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Shut up Martin Keown
We’ve got to better than this if we’re going to go any further
That linesman…. A few weeks off 🤦‍♂️
Darwin Nunez will probably be at Liverpool soon lol
theese two games were un necessarily dramatic and amazing
Keown needs his eyes checked lol
posers
Bollocks to the Quadruple  Nothing being said about City emulating Utds Treble
0:51 why does it say liverpool 1-0 then go back to 0-0
FALSE  if we dont rest 7 we cruise . We play our 2cnd team like its the EFL cup
0:50 - Liverpool vs Bayern Munich?
Liverpool play Joe Gomez, and concede goals. Usual story. Also the difference without Van Dijk
Good game from my Benfica! We are back!
Welcome to Liverpool Nunez
0:51 for some reason liverpool have a second when there winning before the goal🧐
Can't believe the commentators trying to say everything was offside
Бенфика выиграл 🥇 для меня
lololololol martin keown
Keown for specsavers
Tsimikas was utterly sensational good performance from him and fair play Benfica dug in and didn’t give up
Mane never looks happy! Does he want to be at Liverpool? Even when he scores he don’t look happy, amazing player, Liverpool or city are winning it this year, I’m a Chelsea fan so it kills me to say that, but both teams are a cut above the rest,  O and Nunez come and join Chelsea mate, what a player 😮 All the best Liverpool
LOL Martin Keown needs to buy a pair of glasses! 😀
omg buy Nunez what a player
Liverpool City CL final
Come on Liverpool got to win the champions league this season
That side line ref was clearly on Liverpool's payroll lol
Liverpool is like Man U Chelsea  they’ve won every Mager football trophy going
Konate is so big wth
0:54 why it 1-0
Amazing club Liverpool
Benfica it’s not a club it’s a nation !!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Martin Keown "Mane looks like he's just onside to me"
Come on Liverpool great game next man City  Big game
Best team in the world their fans say, cant even beat Benfica at home 🤣😂🙈
Amazing game wish I was there
Keown needs to understand the VAR rules. Anyone but the scousers
Last goal was offside clearly
Commentator, “….Dream of a quadruple as unlikely it might be…”… uh! ?
0:49 Bayern???😂😂
The bloody offsides
Who cares who is in the semi,s 🥰
At 0:49 it's 0-0, then 2 seconds later the score in top left-hand corner says 1-0, then it's back to 0-0 again. I guess Klopp's future facial expression was more suited to the past...
Here's the Petition to take the comentator to specsavers. Sign by hitting the like button
Liverpool we’re lucky.
Thank goodness Gomez isnt our first choice RB. He's become shambolic in his defending, looks slower and hes lazy to keep the defensive line or run back. The 2nd Benfica goal is a good example of what im on about
Nunez too Newcastle...Please
7:25 couldn't have done much better there, what a cracking effort followed by a cracking save!
Liverpool's defending is nothing short of criminal, they will not win CL defending like this, Benfica could have scored 10. City will destroy them in Semi on Sunday,
Are these commentators blind???
Martin Keown is stealing a wage
15 goal thriller that ended 3-3 due to VAR :-)
Fair play to Benfica. Yes they went out 6-4 on aggregate, but they showed that they won't go down easily. And for them to get to this stage of the Champions League is an achievement in itself. However fair play to Liverpool and we'll see how they get on against Villareal in the next round.
The linesman took his fifteen minutes and squeezed the offside out of it
Curse of Bela Guttman strikes again. He said in 1963 that they would not be European champions for 100 years. 2063 then...
English commentators are a disgrace
Is funny how the commentators have no ideea when is an offside or not 😂😂😂
Did Martin Keown forget his glasses or something, specially for Benificas second 😂 English commentators are hilarious.
There was no marking on the 3rd goal due to how class the set piece was
Big day for the linesmens
kloop will sign nunez to replace origi
We're thru again to the semis had to work a bit though, Benfica were better here, Allison and Firmino were both massive, YNWA
Liverpool won
00:53 How come the score says 1-0 with 19 mins played and then back to 0-0 again?
Lets go liverpool semi final here we come
Fire this commentary team. Dreadful.
BT SPORT >commentators: did not see the first goal of  the Benfica was  regular  and the Var was not applied.
the commentators were so quiet, proper worried liverpool would lose it. Benefica were awesome, Darwin Nunez is something else
Is a shame from Benfica's defenders 😤😤
“I think he is off.” !?! The bias got even worse.  Doesn’t make any sense. Liverpool were still comfortably going through. No need to bullshit.
Martin Keown seems like a nice guy, but this has to be his last year commentating...
Fair play to Benfica for putting up a fight. Nunez knows where the back of the net is, he's just a bit hazy on the last defender.
4 goals for nunez if all counted
Nunez pls join
Great ball in from Tsimikas 👏🏽 he can sometimes get forgotten amongst all the great players at Liverpool but he’s been fantastic every time he’s played, would be great to see more of him.
Will we ever get a video without mentioning the atmosphere on a European night at anfield. Nope...
Footeeey!
Offside, VAR, Offside, VAR, Offside, VAR...All this offside by a hair line is spoiling too many games.  Should only be offside if a player clearly has daylight between himself and the last man in defence!!
Is Kloop still endorsing the vaccines? He looks rough and like he's aged about 10 years in the last few months.
I'm embarrassed to share a first name with Martin Keown after that. The bloke is clueless!
Someone give a refresher course to Martin Keown about the offside rule please
🦅❤️ Que lindo é vermelho e branco ❤️🦅
Third goal was offside. When his foot connects with the ball Joa Mario had already gone. Insane decision.
At 19:25 it says 1-0
Liverpool will not win this competition mark my words!
Someone explain the offside rule to Martin Keown. Or better still buy him a new pair of glasses
How many times: the flags up, it’s an offside but it’ll be checked Secs later: it’s ganna count it’s a goal!!
Martin keown certainly knows his offside knowledge 🙄🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is this bt tv or we want Benfica to be offside everytime tv
2 things I learnt. Liverpool reserves scored 3 goals against Benfica main team. The commentators are lunatics.
the linesman is a scouser
Martin Keown proves he's almost as bad as a commentator as he is as a pundit
Gomez, should be given a free transfer. 1990,s defending.
"They sometimes struggle, against Everton"?
That Lino 😂
In terms of flair  and ability  the 1987 to 1991 team was miles better and more explosive
Well done REDMEN YNWA 👏 Onwards and upwards 👍
i don’t know the point in a linesman if every single call he makes gets checked by VAR anyway
For all the talk about how the premier league's the best league to play in & watch just how good is this Competition from other  night's game with Real & Chelsea then last night's game with Athletico & ManC to this game all three games just brilliant advertisements for the EPL & Champions league
Martin Keown can’t see if anything is onside or offside 😂
Bayern scramble it away?
Great strikers
Nuñez has a really bright future ahead of him!
Liverpool smashing it again can't wait for the semis 👊
Without vvd that defence is not the same.good effort from benfica
Martin keoyne is not on our planet no more y this idiot commentates beyond me
VAR CHAMPIONS .
Respect benfica
Poor old nunez
Benfica could have actually won that game if all those decisions went their way
Name me a better 2nd choice left back than Tsimikas-5 assists as a defender and he never starts!
Just shows Liverpool can be BEAT
Tsimkas underrated 💯
Actually considering the 7 changes Liverpool played really well well then fake it didn't create a lot when they did they were prolific.
I'm a Liverpool fan lot of good goals in this game benfica finished their goals wonderfully
Basically Benfica scored 6 goals in 2 matches, to be checked by Klopp if they go against Real Madrid in the final…
Nunez get yourself to Newcastle lad!!
Someone get Martin Keown a new pair of specs. Awful co-commentator.
Keown… what a doughnut
Darwin is a baller
The linesman is having Benfica offside by default.
Liverpool took the Mickey with that line up. Disrespected Benfica.
Seriously we defend poorly
Konate and Van Da need to play last all Prem League games he’s much better
Did the commentator say bayern
Game was fixed
This defensive line has looked very vulnerable the last two matches
What have Benfica got to lose? When Liverpool 6 2 up?
gotta give it to benfica, one of the most under rated teams in the champions league posed a huge threat to liverpool!!
Benfica robbed
Magnificent!!
Commentator said bayern!!
Martin keown would make a shocking linesman his punditry isn't much better
To be honest many people could not believe the team we put out there, but this is  where Liverpool always wanted to be, this same team played 2 or 3 champions league games and cup football this season.
Poor editing by BT… yas missed the first Liverpool goal?? Wtf?????
Commentator is such a mong calling benfica bayern😂
Liverpool's reserves nearly beat Benfica lmao
A great match brilliant to watch n the right side won,well done Liverpool
remember that vvd trent robbo Salah and mane all didn't start and all 3 of Benfica's goals were really close to being offside
Martin Keown stealing a living as a commentator and pundit 🤡
Well played Benfica, Nunez for me is a star striker definitely on a big team books for next season, worth a punt at Man City if they fail to get Haaland. 😁
Is it me or the commentator says “Bayern” instead of Liverpool 0:51
If it wasn't for some very silly lapses in concentration for Benficas defence, they should of easily of beaten Liverpool. Liverpool always seem to get lucky and easier draws in the champions league
Firmino been really good
Keown such a woeful commentator!
Those crosses from Tsimikas are a thing of beauty. So satisfying to witness.
Finally a team that has chipped and gone round Alisson. Been saying it for ages, he's ripe for it. In one on ones he always rushes out and goes to ground early.
Should have gone to specsavers
Benefical were a credit to CL. Don't have the resources of some but played bloody good football.
Benfica were unlucky with them offside goals, Nunez is on fire
How much klop pay linesman
Martin Keown simply hasn't got a clue. How he works in the media is beyond belief.
Bruh how many disallowed goals in this game. Especially for Benfica (and Nunez). He was so unlucky lmao. But what a player he is. Wow he’s truly a special talent. Going to be interesting to see what team he ends up signing for.   But fair play to Benfica for the result. Was hoping they could somehow pull off an upset but it was always unlikely to happen. Still scoring 4 goals against Liverpool is impressive.
i actually thought there was like a world record or something for the most time the offside flag was raised in a game.
Lineo having a horrible day, if var wasn't about there goals wouldn't of counted, linemans needs a new job
Pretty sure in total nunez scored like 5 or 6 goals against liverpool and only 2 have counted
Martin keown doesn’t actually know what offside is does he. Awful commentary
"a tad offside" he was MILES onside 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man City better of buying Nunez than haaland
is martin keown blind??????????
Oh yeah Liverpool were really shaking 🤣🤣6-2 up on aggregate benfica score two late goals yes Liverpool were shaking !!!🤣🤣
These linemen’s need there eyes checked
Why is Martin Keown still allowed to commentate?
The linesmen need glasses please
Offside: The Movie
Martin keown pls stop talking Jesus
YNWA
Martin Keown is blind hahahaha
GREAT PERFORMANCE FROM BOTH TEAMS AND WHAT A FAIR PLAY
“and bayern, with vertonghen…” yea mate well done
This match should have been some sort of record for offsides, jeeez. How many damn offsides? 🤦‍♂️😂
2 goals disallowed !!!
Honestly, Benfica could have evened this on aggregate. What a talent Nunez is.
"Looks to me as if he's a tad offside there" *is clearly miles onside* Good job punditry team...
2:40 - Point blank raaanj 😂😂😂
Got to say benfica had this one if not for all the offsides. Liverpool very very lucky last night
What a great hat-trick by darwin  nunez. What am i saying offside hat trick.
Beautiful game c
about 30 offside goals
How does Martin Keown have a job!
I am sure this commentator said Bayern instead of Benfica. In the Chelsea game, he got a couple of players COMPLETELY wrong - some weren't even in the teams... I am worried about him.
0:50 and Bayern (?) just about scramble it away
was Gomez in a world of his own last night or is it just me ?
How milner can still play at this level when his max speed is about that of a tank is beyond me.
Not gonna lie nunes reminds me of harland when he was bursting on the  scene better grab him quick
Does donkey know the offside rule? Joker.
They talk about robertson setting records for assists, but tsimikas alway puts in a good delivery, another 2 assists
The finals are definitely going to be Liverpool vs real madrid
Was a great game liverpool played very open with a few changes but when changes came liverpool did control more but played attacking allowing benfica to come on to them. Well played benfica tho. Made for a fun game. Liverpool will be bit more disciplined vs villareal I think
The commentary is so so biase...smh
Imagine newcastle get nunez in the summer
Nunez scored 4 goals in my book
can we all admit it would be so cool to see benfica go through to semis! for me benfica shouldve won dont come at me its my opinion
LiVARpool
Honestly in my opinion that last goal shouldnt have been given but hey-ho it was and thats how it is I guess.   Good play last night from both teams I think and Im glad Liverpool got the better end of it as they won 3-1 last game against Benfica.   Ik Im a Liverpool fan but that is not why I say the last goal by Benfica should have been ruled out. Its just how Im seeing it tbh.
It was a free flow football from both sides. Great game overall though. Liverpool Fc will definitely get their new striker in the summer.
Liverpool win
Oh it’s aggregate
their was so much var in this game
Liverpool suppposed to win I say 3-1
Fair play Benfica gave Liverpool a good game
Nunez is something special he will be on few radars in summer for sure
Come on Liverpool, get Nunez signed up
Very entertaining game
The commentators were awful in guessing those offside decisions literally got every decision wrong 🤣
Think Keown needs to go to Specsavers..shocking analysis
It's a good job Martin Keown isn't a linesman.
Can't wait to see Nunez at Arsenal next season, Arsenal have a young team, if Nunez buys into the process, a young team that will only improve 👌🏼
Thru to semis again , fantastic , but carry on defending like that , and we will be punished , said it time and time again , to many good teams will split defense to easy  , it needs sorted , we have world class strikers , who can score , but last night a good side made it look easy at times , bet there were some arses nipping in the last 15 mins , just should not happen
Off side record
Fantastic finishing from Benicia, great to watch.
Was Martin Keown born without eyes?
I am Leicester fan but I give respect for Liverpool
Where would Liverpool be without konate what a great goal scoring defender 💯🔥
benfica deserved to go through
Did no one notice that at 19.25 it said liverpool 1-0 benfica yet no one scored
Plenty of goals love to see it ⚽️🔥
A game of offside.
That linesman so so in favour of Liverpool
The usual insightful nonsense from Keown, how does that Neanderthal still get commentary gigs. Clown
Tsmiskas baller.
No one celebrates anymore because of VAR
those commentators are complete mince, neither of those look offside at all, either during play or on the replays and they're convinced they are
If offside wasn’t a thing benfica would’ve won
Come on benfica I know Liverpool won but for benfica it’s a win
This vid Proves Martin keown is blind
And the player of the evening is a guy named Offside.
I'm glad Martin Keown isn't a linesman 🤣
We did it 💖
0:51 1-0 Liverpool
would love to see Darwin at LFC but not really our type of player.
Martin Keown 😂😂 what a Wally.  Yer he looks offside, it’s on, wow!! 😂
Commentator was blind, the 2nd goal was onside.
Konates goal and the clip before are in the wrong order
Keown needs to go 2 Specsavers
Liverpool just do enough. When it comes to the crunch they show up. This season could be special
7 changes, no problem. Liverpool were always in control. They were never going to let this slip away.
commentaor and lino should be sacked XD
Busiest linesmen ever
Wouldn't be surprised if the linesman called offside for the kick off
How was Benfica's third goal given? That was well offside!
One love Liverpool fc😂😂😂
8:18 Salah has tape on his back, is he not 100% fit or something would explain his lack of goals since the world cup play offs, I know his movement and passing are still top notch but could that explain why he's not at his best.
Name a more iconic duo: Nuñez and Offside goals
Why does Martin Keown get commentary work? What an absolute muppet brain.
Liverpool should sign Nunez to further strengthen their front line for all the games they need to play… what a player he is.
“And the Ukrainians pull it away but it’s off site”
If both of them benfica offside goals weren't offside, benfica would of won and shocked liverpool
i fell sad for benfica they played really good
If Keown says its offside, chances are its not.
Despite VAR trying to stop benfica from scoring it was a great effort   Every time a side score against Liverpool they are so quick to try and find a way to rule it out
Bobby ❤️‍🔥
"Looks offside x3" 3 goals given.  Terrible commentary
I can’t be the one who noticed how SPARKLING WHITE Firmino’s teeth are in the close ups 😂
Linesman trying to save varpool
Var ruining footie how 2 benefuca goals flagged offside when goals cant celerbrate
Is it just me. Or did the corner for the 1st goal go out of play?
Two great teams, a joy to watch!
Tbh without the our fans in our home stadium, this could’ve been a different outcome
3 offside goals bar and the ref were awful
I think we can rule out VAR as a career path for Martin Keown. At least he gave it a go
Liverpool give so many chances to the opposition, if they play like that against man city they will get hammered.
"Think he's just a tad offside" ..... guys about a mile onside
that 2nd goal was ridiculously bad defending
Roberto Firmino = Brazillian Lesbian
Liverpool are scouse......... ....And Villareal nickname is Yellow Submarine........ ....A song by the beatles........ .......Who are also scouse........... ........A merseyside derby?.....
Absolute horror show from the linesmen
I think we can all agree alisson is again clear of mendy
Think the commentary team need their eyes checking. Both of those were clearly onside.
mistake in the score at 0:54
Benfica played well that match. Shows how Liverpool can crumble without key players such as vvd and robbo
This match was really intense. So mamy offsides , so much drama. I think Benfica deserved to get the goals and go on extra time. Really good game
Martin Keowen doesn't get straight lines
that salah play at the end was incredible and he easily could’ve scored if he didn’t pass to mane he was 6 yards out, further pushes his interview the other day where he said idc about scoring aslong as the team does
great
These commentators are so ridiculously biased towards the English teams it's laughable
I’m waiting for the Portuguese to say “BENFICA CARALHO 🇵🇹”
Lesson learnt, if Keown says it’s offside, it’s onside
Why does Martin keown call firmino firminio, fks me off
Darwin Nunez finishing is top quality 👌
Villereal next!!!
Co commentator on every single Benfica goal - "yeah defo offside, no doubt about that"  3 seconds later - freeze frame shows player's about 2 foot onside  😵‍💫😵‍💫😅
Seven changes made by Klopp in a CL Q Final is ridiculous.
We played half of our team so I’m not  supried with  this result  but fair play to benfica
FANTASTIC GAME BY LIVERPOOL TEAM
What a game
Fun fact: We have never been knocked out from a UCL semifinal under Klopp.
Nunez what a player 😮
1-0 Liverpool at 19:24
2 years ago benfica would have turned this tie around if VAR wasn’t there
Am a Chelsea fan,   I hope Liverpool win the champions league title now as  Chelsea are out, Not City and Madrid GO ON LIVERPOOL STAY STRONG  💪💪💪💪💪💪
What a BIAS commentary from these two pillocks... If against Liverpool they must be offside. What a two halfwits
Who else noticed that the score went 1-0 randomly in the start of the game
That nunez is some player. Be a good signing for Liverpool he would.
How in God's name do people like Keown etc get jobs as pundits/ co commentators ? Benficas 2nd and 3rd goals were clearly onside, yet he's adamant they're off. Think he should go to specsavers 🤓🤓
The stupid commentator hasn't got a clue what offside is.
I feel like the flagsman felt a bit lonely that night.
Benfica are proper historic club, they were winning European cups when Liverpool were still in Division 2, before they were bankrolled by Premier league greed.
As a Liverpool fan I have to admit Benfica played very well, great match.
Benfica 🤯 shame their defence didn’t have the same belief their attack did to go through. Otherwise Liverpool would of been humiliated at Anfield yet again
That var check for benfica goal 1... The ball is still being controlled by benfica player a full touch before he passes.
It's a bit mad to play the offside trap with four defenders who've never played together but that's the Liverpool way. We were always going to score three, so as long as we didn't concede five we'd be fine! Having said that, we caught them offside about four times. How did Sadio manage to get caught off when there was no defender he couldn't see? I am so glad we didn't have to play Atletico Madrid. Champions League tickets are too expensive to watch a foreign Burnley.
keown 2/2 wrong with the offsides
I have to say, Benfica put up a great display but overall. Liverpool made the most intelligent attacking.
Good job UEFA invested in the Amazon 3 for 2 linesmen flags offer last weekend.
Could of been 5-5
Imagine if there's no VAR, referees was invalid 2 legal goals from Benfica, such a shame.
Sounds like commentator momentarily thought Liverpool were playing Bayern...
Linesman should be sacked, what's the point of having them? I get that they were close called but why not just let VAR do the job
3-3 but Liverpool is better the play only whit Half off is force Liverpool save some players because the want to win the premier league
This linesman needs binning off doesn’t he? Two wrong offside calls! VAR doing it’s job
Worrying how easily they wandered straight through our midfield & defence🤔
to think if the offside rule didn't exist Benfica could've won the match
That was actually a great save by Alisson to deny their 4th, low and bouncing one hand full stretch save
Keown had a stinker with these offsides lol
I just loved watching the Benfica fans still singing and still waiting for the players to come out again. I have supported Liverpool for 51 years now but great spirit they had tonight and I give credit where is due, but this is the beauty of football and to see Benfica fans still singing after the game even though they where knock out just where happy to get this far in the competition that no one gave them a chance to me fair play to them and there fans, oh and I loved the White Benfica top was beautiful May even buy one myself. YNWA
without VAR this match would have been finished 3- 1 for Liverpool :-D Good job, Ref!
Tsimikas whips in a great dead ball.
forwards and midfield look good , but defence looks dodgy . city or real madrid will be a different cookie .
Darwin Nunez’ wife gets pregnant:  ‘Of course it will be checked for offside’
Battle of the strikers in the semi final......Benzema v Salah & Mane
Me thinks that Konate is really starting to settle and is gaining in confidence week by week.👏👍🤝
Talk about making it difficult for yourself!
Nunez is going to be some player, my days, finishing just comes natural
Note to bommentator, , Liverpool played benfica not bayern
Fantastic deliveries for those Firmino goals and Nunez...... He's some player
liverpool real madrid final i think , real will be to much for city Benzema on fire , van dyke to keep him quirt in the final liverpool 1 real o
The stunning inability to comprehend offside by the commentary team is hilarious. Not gonna lie!
I really wanted Liverpool to not go through today but fair play to them for holding on to their first leg win.
United need to go all out for Nuenez
Perder com Ingleses, seja ela que equipa for, é Vergonha. Faltou mais um bocadinho, Liverpool Manchester Inglaterra, correr com eles todos.
should be some cracking semis
What a save from Allison at the end. Kept Liverpool in it. Hopefully a City V Liverpool final.
Benfica did brilliantly. Gave Liverpool a good run for their money.
RS23 should change his name to……….. fair play 🤪
Good job Keown isn’t on VAR he’s got less sight than Stevie Wonder 🤣 the pitch literally showed they were both onside
Are the commentators blind with these offside calls
We didn’t have a full team out for most of the game yet still played class but to be fair benfica are such an underrated team and that nunez wow class
Alisson had no buisiness making that save from Nune's volley. Incredible stop!
Well done benfica they play better than Liverpool, was too lucky I can’t believed honestly 3 gol was gool but they didn’t accepting they gave them outside? Not true game …….!!!!!!!????
This is why Liverpool won't win
liVARpool
Martin Keown headed too many footballs.
If benfica had a good keeper, would have been even more tasty
Come on Liverpool ❤️
Are the pundits blind? The 3rd Benfica goal was clearly on side.
Nuñez did a very well chip
Utd need to make a move for Nunez in the summer if we want to challenge again. Could be a top no 9 for years to come!
Benfica knocked themselves out with with goals given away and errors at the back
Brilliant game. Seeing Salah this year, how is he not been awarded world player of the year. He is easily better than Messi by a country mile. Only a move to Barca or Madrid seemingly will change that. I even believe Mane is better than Messi
"Of course, it will be checked". Yes, we feckin' know!!!
That linesman had a shitter today 🤣🤣
Imagine if they got those offside goals on point, Liverpool would have had a shocker!
Martin “he’s clearly offside” keown.
Konate definitely one to watch on them corners 👌
Darwin is class. A number 9 is the best possible sense though Goncalo Ramos is also a massive prospect. Shame for West Ham they didn't get a deal over the line for Nunez in January as there will be far more teams looking now especially those who miss out on Haaland. Liverpool included
Raucous home fans. Some serious polite applause tonight.
Certainly got your monies worth,,cracking game,,benfica were unlucky.
For better or for worse…I absolutely hate VAR.
That was the worst game of the season how are we not beating Benfica
LiVARpool
0:52 its says liverpool have scored but they havent
Hilarious offside rulings. Both miles on side and yet Keown and the linesman can’t see it lol
Half of Liverpool’s chances came from Tsimikas and Diaz
Does anyone think we should just go out and get Nunez, he was superb last night!
That linesman needs to be sacked!!! Some woeful decisions
That flag just didn't wanna stay down tonight, ey?! For crying out loud!!! Lol 😂  Good game tho!
How does Martin Keown keep getting employed?
Soup
Commentators: he’s offside Me: he’s clearly on!  😒
Liverpool Vs Real Madrid in the final again?
That commentator hasn’t got a clue what he’s talking about
These linesman actually get a salary?
Liverpool need to sign Darwin Nunez… ASAP!!
Are the commentators okay? Need to go to specsavers
Keown out
Damn not a score line I was expecting too see but that's 2 english teams into semi finials what a game though
World record for most false offside calls lol
Arsenal need a manager like benfica manager … what a man … what a manager and arsenal need to grab that benfica’s number 9 then arsenal sorted believe me … otherwise arsenal will dream of finishing top 4 for another 20 years forget the title
Liverpool ain't winning no more trophies!
That has to be a record! In the champions league there was like or 5 dissalowed goals
The offside game 😅
Liverpool just switched off after Bobby’s goals, people sleep on him still a class player.
Just LUCK!
Keown, the gift that keeps on giving. What an awful commentator
Benifa show great team comebk fair play 2 them :) what a entertaining game :) Nunez where he going.. great 4 any team :)
I'm glad martin Keown doesn't do VAR.........his offside views are about as useful as his personality commentating.......non existent!
If Nuñez watched his lines just a bit more, I think Benfica could’ve just about done it
Martin Keown really is a clueless buffoon.
0:51 look at the score?
Called them Bayern 🤣👍
Nunes what a player. Top level elite striker.
If it was other way round he wouldn't be saying wow. They was blatantly onside. Why the wow n depression in voice like he got a bet on 🤣
Does Keown know what offside actually is?
As a Chelsea fan I pray either Liverpool or real win this year I can’t watch city win I literally cannot flipping do it
Nobody cares…. Glory Glory Man United
I can't believe how much football has been damaged through var. Every goal celebration on ice until confirmation. The human element disappeared..
Judd trump the linesman
can someone teach the co commentator the offside rule please
Martin Keown to specsavers
Nunez can finish
Darwin Nunez gives me haaland vibes.
All of Benfica's goals were initially canceled as offside. We can undestand now how Liverpool has done all these years in Europe and England....
literally flagged every benfica attempt offside
Konate & Tmiskas!: Van Dyke & Alexander- Arnold weren't even missed!  Nothing gives a team more confidence than your big defender scoring headers from corners! Tmiskas: Fantastic, World class curling crosses! Klopp  keeps improving players more than any coach in World! Gaurdiola just buys finished product fr massive money. Last season I didn't Konate n Tmiskas would make grade at Liverpool! Klopp is incredible Coach, he can see a player now, n how he can improve them to a higher future level! Villarreal got no chance! Their final was Beating Bayern. Liverpool different level in Champs League. Liverpool v Madrid Final, City will crumble under pressure again, but win Premier League cus they will have to! FA Cup anyones! If Liverpool win Champs League or Premier League again, u have to say this is one of best/maybe the best Liverpool side ever! And even stronger next year! 😲😀
Error. 00:51 showing 1-0 LOL
How could that commentator not tell that he was well on-side ?
I was waiting for another offsite goal
Linesman really didn't have a clue did he 🤣🤣🤣
Distant alarm bells? From where? Mars????
Anfield goin silent after YNWA again
Portugal 🇵🇹 where the talent is definitely
Martin Keown not understanding the offside rule despite playing in the famous Arsenal back four 😂
Bretford : hold my beer
Cheeky of Klopp, complained all week about having the toughest schedule then played his second team.
Klopp really got schooled at home after what he said before hand
Tsimikas played really well... proud of him as a LFC fan 🙌
0:51 the scoreboard changed to one nill before liverpool scored
That linesman should be sacked or needs to get glasses.
0:52 liverpool have not scored but it says 1-0 liverpool 😭
Was the goal offside?
Why does firmino always enter martial arts mode
If it wasn’t for offsides Benguela would have won
Martin keown worst commentator I’ve heard In long while everything this muppet says is wrong 🤣
what a match 😊
Their second goal wasn’t offside, he was behind the line on grass 😂
Next big match against city again lets get ficuse
Nunez in the PL next season
Why at 0:51 does the score say 1-0 to Liverpool before the goal was scored hello EA
Nuniez looks like a player. Konate is looking like a top signing as well. I think Liverpool will win the CL and City the Prem.
0:52 guys , the score is already 1-0 before the goal  ahahaha
LiVARpool paying the refs again
Amazing save by Allison at the end that the commentators seemed to ignore
Says 1 0 before Liverpool scored
Konate not interested in the header? But he’s the first one in the mix and jumped the highest 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️😂😂
Very entertaining game! Some lovely, well taken goals and a super save from Alison too. Nunez looks really sharp! Into the semis we march.
Was sat in anfeild road the next block over from the benfica fans and Jesus they can make some noise
Fair play Nuñez. Benfica 2 off side Goals Disallowed
Nunez is a brilliant player ! Get him to the prem
Not a bad result for Liverpool reserves
only thing I've learnt from this is that Martin keown needs glasses
Lino had a nightmare this game
The best unselfish striker i have ever seen. Roberto Firmino. He could score 4 if he was just playing for his name. and could play every game. but unselfish person can not be selfish never. and that is what peaple is asking him. to play for his name not for the team. Just who really knows football can see how complete player is Firmino. Whether he scores or not. his prensence if very important.
Anyone notice at 51 seconds in it says Liverpool have a goal when they didn’t score
Darwin has some crazy finishing whoever signs him in the summer have themselves a ballwr
Not sure has worse eyesight, Martin Keown or the Linesman
4:45 Firmino's volley was 10/10.
Such an amaizing game
We put Liverpool to the sword, painful to see us go out... we move
I miss the days when ITV and Sky shared the champions league. The punditry on these games from BT is dreadful more often than not.
Why did the commentary say Bayern?
0:50 was this match fixed.  The score says 1-0 3mins before the goal is scored.
LiVARpool back at it again 😂
Drawing 3-3 to Liverpool at their stadium ego are one of the best teams in the world is impressive
A future United played showing Liverpool what’s up
Someone tell Darwin the offside rule will ya?
Is Martin Keown drunk here?
9
NUNEZ FINISHES IS QUALITY
I have to say, Nunez looks like a phenomenal talent!  Very good touch and a superb finisher!
This would have been a 0-0 if it wasn't for var
Good job we have VAR that would have been 2 clean goals from benfica disallowed it makes the game so much better. Btw I think we should look at getting nunez
Darwin please come to arsenal
Might be the hardest game they’ve played all season
That's linesman drinks in Arkles six nights a week.
These BT commentators are so biased towards English teams, the amount of wrong offside comments and saying wow when they were given against Liverpool, when they were clearly onside, then when Liverpool got the offside he goes quiet and says nothing...same with the Madrid v Chelsea game, so much bias when it comes to english teams, makes the commentary so bad to listen to, rather have the option to turn it off.
Liverpool 3 Vs 3 offside 😜Lol
befica give it 100% .made a real game of it.our back lot were a bit of a shamble without virgil.var was busy .anyways...next game please.ynwa
That Darwin nunes playing for the move. Arsenal waiting guy.
Agreed, a change in the back 4 clearly made the difference when Liverpool were put under too much pressure in the last 15-20 minutes. A lack of experience is all. Tsimikas rivalling Robertson with those corners and crosses!
YÖō Brüddä England, So we now know it's The Mighty E,P,L Vs La Liga,  Well bring it bumbaklarrt on. #🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿PREMIERLEAGUERULES 🇪🇺
Very good game, this is what UCL is about. And to those saying the VAR decisions looked "dodgy"... when it comes to the offside rule, remember the arms don't count. That's why the player looks offside at 06:44, but he most definitely is not
0:50 commentator calls benfica bayern
That nunez goal was clear as the sky
VAR has definitely ruined football for life
How BT still employ Martin Keown is beyond me
Im a liverpool fan, are these commentators deluded if they think benfica’s 2nd and 3rd was offside. Also the linesman needs a new job i think
Martin Keown: yep I think he is offside to me - is 200000 miles onside 🤡🤡🤡
0:50 did he say Bayern?😭
That lines man was having fun 😂
Benfica was just unlucky with the offsides
Very different performances from the two assistant referees
Love the sound of the English celebration compared to other Europe teams celebration. It’s either yeeeee or oooooohhhhhhh
It's worth noting that this defensive line up hasn't played much together. Having the normal back-four of Robertson, van Dijk, Matip and Alexander-Arnold is very different as they have played together for 3 or 4 seasons. Individually the back-four that played tonight are very good players, they just need some time to form chemistry.
0:50 - Did he just say Bayern?
Beneficia got so unlucky, I feel bad for them
Konate has been brilliant so far!!
Martin Keown literally needs bifocals guys blind af
Are these commentators okay? They're clearly onside
how many offside
Nunez is the Portuguese Werner but he can actually score haha 😂
Bloody good match..
VAR shocking today for killing the vibe after a goal, feel sorry for nunez and yaremchuk didn't get to enjoy the moment
Whoever signs Darwin… wow
Great play for both teams more credit to benfica for not giving up and made Liverpool shake abit but great match today well done for the 22 men👏👏👏👏
How Martin Keown thought that second Benfica goal was offside, is beyond a joke
Nunez is some baller. Great game of football. I Hope he signs for us. What a player.
good thing those 2 aren't linesman, jesus
Where in the semis credit to benfica though grest striker they got
How benficas third has giving after the forward touch it in a offside position is beyond me
Liverpool did alright as they was palying there second team
Nunez what a player he is. Klopp should have a look at him as the future of our frontline he’s brilliant, him and Diaz would be electric together.
Still waiting for us to start playing well.  Wana see how much damage we can do to a team. Swear somebodys getting a hiding from the reds soon 🔴👊🏻⭐️
Shame on the lines man whose double offside calls were overturned by VAR. That’s one too many…
Great football Club Liverpool
That third was obviously offside
Martin had a stinker 🤣🤣🤣
gg benefica
I can't lie if all of benficas goals counted liverpool would've got slapped
shocking defending by Liverpool. absolutely terrible.
Tsimikas >>>> Robertson
Commentators very bias...saying it is offside when it clearly isn't
The linesman will be ruled out for a few weeks with a shoulder injury caused by excessive flag use 😯
Quadruple still on…
Those linesmen are crazy didnt get a single decision correct
Klopp is gonna buy Nunez watch
Commentators got all the offsides wrong haha
Good game let down by the current state of football
IM LOVING IT....🤣🤣 Big Boys.👍
nunez is a quality finisher
Those commentators must be blind, given replays and sure they were offside.
The ball was in the net 15 times over the 2 legs, but only 10 of them counted.
Var gave the right decision end of who ever did it tonight must do premier league games
huge props to big ibou konate. his heading abilities and calmness and composure under pressure is insane for his age. also plays a wicked ball out to the wingers. MOTM performance iyam
I've heard 'Pool were 1 of the clubs interested in Darwin Nuñez... he was obviously out to impress tonight! Great game, all-in-all.
Darwin Nunez, welcome to Old Trafford
Amazing games both sides played outstanding our defensive back line is a little bit shakey with out trent and vvd nunez caused a hassle hes a brilliant player also firminos performance was outstanding and allisons save kept us calm towards the end great game
Firmnio is gonna fly kick someones head off for real by accident one of these days lol
Keown needs glasses 😂
congrats martin keown on his first commentary, but next time needs to bring his glasses cause his offside calls were ridiculous 😂
Beautiful strike by Diaz. Amazing signing, he looks like he’s been playing for Liverpool for years
If Liverpool played their regular team it wudda been murder,that seemed like Klopp ran a test run team
One day, even after him playing for Liverpool for 7 years now, the commentators might learn that Firmino doesn't have an 'h' in his name. No matter how many times Ian Darke pronounced his name correctly, Martin Keown would continue to say 'Firminho' throughout.
Linesmans had a shocker and then one half of the commentary seemed like he was backing Liverpool all the way seeming baffled by the goals being allowed
Nunez is top class
Time for Keown to go Specsavers I think. My great nan could see those goals clearly should stand and she been dead nearly a decade…how do these guys get a job commentating haha.
Two very confident shouts of "definitely offside" by Keown... and two onside goals!  The guy doesn't have a clue.
LiVARpool bin dipping murderers
Damn I watched the wrong game   Liverpool looking *really* strong contenders for the UCL this year
Need to get rid of that linesman. 2 wrong decisions
Officials really wanted benfica to be offside
if liverpool are home first next round villarreal will definitely take advantage
No atmosphere for that first goal
Is Martin Keown blind 😂😂😂😂? “The cut of the grass makes it look tight” right??? So have u not noticed 2 Liverpool players in the next batch of grass 😂😂 to make them onside. Arsenal eh
Benfica should of won like 6 4 they put Liverpool through a tough game
Nuniez looks good
I hate it how BT sports has the result in massive lettering and in the title. Sometimes I don't know the result of matches,  and would like to keep it that way before watching.
0:49 and who?...
Awful defensive performance from Livarpool
No Van Dijk to command the defence. Very risky B team line up by Klopp that almost backfired.
Am I the only one who noticed the scoreboard say 1-0 at 19:25 without a shot on goal?!
That Darwin Nunez looks decent for 22 years old. I'd say he'd be a good prospect for Liverpool
why was mané that far offside for that long??
These commentators have such Liverpool bias it’s clearly onside I’m gonna go back to watching games on mute
Defensive mistakes from Benfica - its seems anyway - Benfica were unlucky last week - unlucky again this week.
Livarpool strike again
What was that chant before the second Firmino goal?
What a match
Liverpool fans are awful, didn’t celebrate at all
“What an atmosphere” - ground was dead silent
Nunez is the best football player ever
Did anyone notice 0:50 the goal changing from 1-0 to 0-0 🤣
I've heard Man Utd are favourites to sign Benfica striker Nunes in the summer.
Anyone else notice luis diaz doing a fair amount of moaning at his teammates when attacks don’t go right 👀
Martin keown really doesn't have a clue what offside is
Imagine what the score could have been without VAR 😂😂
0:49 “and bayern with vertonghen gets it away” Is that commentator going senile?
Martin Keown whenever someone is visibly on-side, 'he looks offside to me'
Nunez to lfc that was his trail
Anyone else see it said 1-0 to Liverpool at 0:54
.....does anybody in that commentary box understand the offside rule.....he's definitely offside...well no he isn't...its marginal..that's why they are using VAR...
City ground atmosphere> Anfield
I love seeing firmino score so much 😭😭❤️❤️
I really hope Arsenal have a Liverpool like reinvigoraton one day. Being a Gooner is nothing but pain😢
Nunez .. looks like a good striker... ... knows how to finish.
Without VAR, Benfica would have won this 5-3. The first ‘goal’ was offside? By what? A centimetre?
Origi looks set to leave and with firmino hitting 30 Darwin Nunez looks like the perfect replacement
6-2
Martin keown needs an eye inspection
Nunez looks like a young zlatan
That linesman had an absolutely awful game 😂😂
Money makes players like Ruben Dias, cancelo, Silva, ederson (and I'm only mentioning a few) leave Benfica its a great club but in this modern football where Americans ,Arabs and Russians take over football clubs , teams like benfica seem to have disappeared...but just to remind that Benfica once again is in the semi finals of the youth champions League and no ,Liverpool ain't there coz u can't buy the success of a youth team u have to grow it and in that Benfica is number 1 in the world 🙌
What a nonsense! Benfica can't celebrate goals because flag constantly up! Line ref sacks.
Liverpool took it easy today. Coasted through the game. Villarreal in for a tough assignment!
The linesman had a howler
Like schoolboy football
i love to see it
Martin Keown is the worst
Núñez is quality. Would definitely love to see him in a premier league teams shirt. YNWA ❤️❤️
That little "POP" at 9:19 with firmino was beautiful. Lol
Darwin Nunez is world class, forget Haaland I’d rather gamble on Nunez.
This really highlights how bad Martin Keown is as a commentator. Every offside wrong, described Konate’s goal in an inaccurate way... the guy is blind.
no offence but conceding 3 goals at home is not a good look for Liverpool
7:30 If only that went in this game could have ended very differently
Shocking linesman, commentators also love the fact that every goal was offside and was surprised when given even by var haha
Can these commentators not see the pitch or something? Of course the goals that were given were onside, by a yard…and they act surprised…
The damage was already done in the first leg but Liverpool don't look like a great team to me especially defensively. Nunez looks like a great player. Can see many teams trying to sign him in the summer.
Allison way too hesitant with those two goals
Konate same goal against same team
so the linesman has to flag in case he's wrong so he can get mugged off by VAR, so why have a lino anymore?
Well done Liverpool but as others have said fair play to Benfica they made it very tough for us! What a match and a cracking semifinal line ups!
Nunez is a underrated finisher
Liverpool won't win the CL They concede more than the rest. VVD needs to go at the end of season
BT sport commentators, and especially co-commentators, are.... not good.
we,Liverpool,need to get that under dog mentality back soon.
Tsimikas 🤐
Another champion's league semi... Get in....
Congrats, Liverpool
5:49 linesman is defo Russian 🤣
Fair play to benfica. They kept going and although they didn't get the result to go through, a 3-3 draw is a fine effort especially after being 3-1 down. Nunez looks like a quality player.
Proud of Liverpool and benfica but up a fight
Nunez is really good.
0:51 Liverpool magically got a goal for a second there lol
Bobby and Kostas were just sublime, fair play to Benfica too
Not another english champions league final, just shows the premier league is the best in the world
0:51 think commentator says bayern instead of benfica lol
one of the biggest flaws in football is the offside rule, no one knows how its applied
I’m happy to see Greek players like Tsimikas and Odysseas thrive abroad
Mad that it could've been like 6-3 if not for offsides
2:42 from point blank ranj
Allison’s save omd 👏🏼
The linesman had a mare
That save wtf
As a Liverpool fan, I have to be honest that this offside trap is only making us concede more goals. On Sunday, most times, City would launch the ball behind our defence and their players would escape Liverpool’s offside trap. The same happened today. I’m happy that we are through to the semi-finals but if we keep risking this offside trap strategy in big games such as the FA Cup and UCL, it could lose us games. Fair play to Benfica for giving us a test. Onto next game now.
Can’t believe Bayern didn’t concede that early chance
martin keown made to sound a mug lol
nunez is absolutely quality
Tsimkas would start in ALOT of teams he’s top draw 👍🏽👍🏽
0:53 bt randomly giving Liverpool a 1-0 lead
Thank god martin keown isnt operating VAR
A few clubs could benefit from getting Nunez. When he learns to time his runs better he’ll be a monster 🔥
0:51 BT Sport predicted the game before it happened
Mane disallowed goal at the end was definitely a brilliant piece of skill from Salah VAR is a joke sometimes! (Semifinals here we commmmmeeeeeeeee!❤️👍🏾⚽️🏆💯)
Tsimikas is brilliant ngl
Benfica gave us a hard game they put 100% they had lots of good chance but we held on firmino is playing at his best 👌💪💯
Benfica could’ve won that if they had luck on their side
Darwin Núñez is gonna be hot on the transfer market after this
Keown needs to get to Specsavers. His offside calls are atrocious. 😁
Referees useless
Brighton nearly signed Darwin Nunez and if they had they'd be fighting for a place in Europe
Had the game a week  ago been a different result, benfica would of gone through.
Nobody gonna talk about the MOST tightest onside I HAVE EVER SEEN????
Benfica can be proud of themselves. Getting to the quarters of the Champions League is not easy considering the turmoil at the club atm. Goes to show how important defending set pieces is as it can at times define games.
Linesman was Liverpools best defender tonight
Goodness me nuñez could have won that game all on his own mate! Mala suerte mi amigo
how is Benfica's third not offside? and how was Sterling not onside on sunday? wtf has happened to the offside law
gatunos
KONATE MAN 😍😍😍 what a header!!
This Benfica in the premier league would be a title contestant, they literally trashed liverpool defense and always seemed to score so easy, different playing angles and made liverpool defense non existent
this game will be known by the offside game.... where liver without a pool showed off its weakness in offside trap. anyways benfica is shiet
very annoying Firminio didn’t do a no look tap in
Anyone else notice the 1-0 scoreline pop up about 4 seconds before the goal went in for Liverpool? 😳
Still not convinced by the VAR decision for 3rd benfica goal. Looks clear offside and they came to a decision pretty quickly
What a great game, benfica tried
Such biased commentary!
to me Liverpool are the classic case of mostly average individuals that do brilliantly together.
Keown needs new glasses got virtually every offside call wrong.
Something must be seriously wrong with that assistant referee. He should never be in a top-level game again.
Why does it say 1:0 at 0:51 lmao
Amazing Benfica 👋🏼
LFC are lucky as fck. Great draw against Villarreal they can't complain they get all the luck. Hope City stuff them in the final. As a neutral Im sick of the Scouse self entitled chavs and their vile dump of a City. Come on City, do the Country a favour and hammer the fckn chavs
Shame mane was offside, that skill by Salah to set the chance up was sublime.
Anyone who needs to explain the offside rule to somebody; as tempting as it is, don't use this game. *Hope the linesmen are alright. Cup of tea and pat on the back for them both.
Numez needs to move to go barcelona or uk he looks fire 🤜🏼🤛🏼
Man utd should buy nunes what a finisher
Is that commentator blind?? On Benfica's third, saying he's a foot off when looking at the freeze frame when he's clearly close to level or just on. Crazy
HE NEARLY BEHEADED SALAH WITH THAT KUNGFU CELEBRATION KICK......................
Are the commentators on drugs? both the second and third Benfica goal was both clearly onside... Like Clearly
darwin nunez is a serious serious player
This Liverpool side is beatable.
Like if Liverpool will win the quadruple 🔥
Some pundits these days who should be football experts are terrible. The Benfica player was clearly onside for one of their goals and he said "he looks off to me".
Early on the score said 1-0 before it was even 1-0? Was something cut?
Flaggy mans got a well easy job, see's a goal.. *FLAG IT*
David Nunez could be the next Luis Suarez
I’m really pleased this was put on YouTube because I was working and I was unable to record the match. This should be done for all games
Nunez looks a top player.  Be surprised if some of the big money clubs don't come looking in the summer.
Heartbreak for benfica. I had a feeling they would make a comeback but it wasn't their night. They did Portugal proud.
well done to benfica for getting a draw at anfield!
BonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBonerBoner
Bloody hell fair play to Benfica
Benfica did well. Villereal won't be easy but Liverpool will be the favourites for that game
A hatrick of offside goals 😂
The linesman should be sacked for life!!! 3 goals, 3 mistakes!!! Unacceptable
How does Martin Keown not see that those Benfica goals are both onside in the replays?
Man united need to sign nunez he looking good
nunez looks aight we need him at arsenal. arteta best have watched this match
3:36 is is just me or does that line not look straight
It is comical how many offsides there were.
Nunez has a very bright future
Nunez is the real deal
Nunez with the quasi hatrick
That save from Alison was actually huge. Could have been a very uncomfortable finish otherwise
Did anyone else hear He commentators say Bayern instead of benfica
Liverpool with the easiest draw and jsut being let off the hook
Imagine Everton scoring against Liverpool at anfield
It would have been nice if the commentator had known what he was talking about.
Sign nunez
How bad are these commentators eyesight?
No Van Dijk, No defence 😓 amazing play by Tsimikas and Bobby showing who's the original boss 👏 YNWA.
Nunez, wow.. Looks a baller,!
It was a bad bad night for Benfica. Not only did they get knocked out, Nunez just put himself on every big clubs shopping list this summer!
Wish the liverpool Gk would stay on his line !
point blank raaaange 2:41
i’m an lfc fan but props to benfica i started getting a little nervous tbf
Happy we (Liverpool) made it through to the semis but fair play to Benfica they gave us a match tonight. That Darwin Nunez looks a proper decent player.
If Brighton had landed Núñez last summer they'd actually be in a European spot! The guy is on fire, goal machine
We want nunez!!
Is Martin Keown blind??
0:49-0:51 Bayern?
So Many Offside for Benfica Unlucky
Welcome to Arsenal Nunez
Firmino is class! Such a creative player!! YNWA!
Manes goal was onside
Who is Nunez he has scored like 5 goals today!!
2 offside goals from benfica
"haHaHaHa liVARpool pAy tHE reFs"
Think Klopp should be enquiring about Nunez if he hasn't already.
Vertonghen has been such a good signing for Bayern
Not bad for benfica doing one of their worst season in the past few years and managing to be in the last 8 , shame that rafa silva probably benfica best player was injured for this game . Congrats Liverpool although I think Real got this one.
Martin Keown is a simpleton.
if we play like that against City we will get smashed
How many offside goals?
Great game from Benfica 🇵🇹
Clueless commentary from Keown.
Keowns blind
What's the new definition for "Tank"?    Ibrahima Konate! Man's got thighs thicker than oak trunks!
Prison TV.
BT need to get better commentators. Was that Keown saying the guy was a foot offside without waiting for VAR? What an idiot.
Boom 💥
The linesmen in this game were utterly atrocious, great game but good god, they both need the sack
What the hell is that card display at the start terrible support
Offside trap was horrendous today. Just shows how much of a difference having Van dijk in there makes on the defensive line. Full backs weren’t staying in line either. Back to business this weekend hopefully 🤞🏼
Benfica’s second goal: “looks like he’s offside” , he must be legally blind.
If there is one thing this game has taught me it’s that Martin Keown has got a terrible eye for offsides.
How many goals can be denied lmao
*easily onside*  Martin Keown: Yeh he’s definitely offside
3rd Benfica goal looking at the wrong offside depends if the central benfica player touched it or not if he did then Nunez was offside again if he didn't touch it Nunez was well onside and no need for VAR....but I wonder what they looked at ?
Linesman had a shocker and Martin Tyler can't see lines on a pitch even when the picture is frozen. Honestly...
Firmino 😎 🤙🤙
offside score was higher =)) than normal one
This is what happens when we don't play Van Dijk
Another ten fifteen mins and benfica were thru! Liverpool will bottle against whoever they play in the final
Some great goals tonight, but Benfica’s first was immaculately taken. Alisson’s save at the bottom corner was top drawer too.
Great match , the young striker needs to be in the Premiership.
commentators blind, well onside
Gomez to blame for 2 goals, bit of a concern tbh
VAR actually be moving players from where they really were, istg
If it wasn't for VAR, all 3 Benfica goals would've been ruled out LOL
I'm sorry but the atmosphere looked so dead. Everytime Liverpool scored the fans would give a half hearted clap but some didn't even care! they would just look at their phones and not even celebrate. Honestly it was nearly as bad as City at the Emptyhad!
Poor Benfica man, didn't get to celebrate any of their goals they all got wrongly flagged then checked.. nonetheless should be proud of that performance Vs Liverpool and in Anfield coming back with 3 goals
Lino having a stinker
Appaling commentary really, Martin Keown calling everything a foot offside when it clearly isn't, and the main commentator calling Benfica 'Bayern'...
Love this team full of character from manger to players for sure will go down in the history books ♥️
I hope Marin Keown never had a few drinks before his offside blunders.
Love foreign fans , especially the massive ooooooooooooo they get when scoring
Arsenal need to buy nunez asap
As a Liverpool fan it's so good to finally be able to field a pretty much fully changed team to our B-team and still play well. Been wanting this squad depth for years. Shame we couldn't win but getting through was the main thing! Onwards and upwards and big respect to Benfica. Showed great heart
@2:41 pon blank ranj hahaha
The linesman didn't want Benfica to celebrate their goals naturally 😂
We have to sign Nunez
Konate is becoming a beast and still very young
How much are these referees being paid
IF VAR did not exist City would have won 3-2 on Sunday
😂😂 does Martin keown know the offside rule??
Commentators are so biased in making offside calls
Thanks Benfica for great game of football. Great to watch,love football for games like this.
well done to benefica. they could of crumbled at 3-1 but were honest and continued to show fight till the end. we move on to the semi. ynwa.
got to be a record of most goals that have gone to var that were given or disallowed
NUFC could regret not going all out for nunez in Jan. I'm still quietly confident that selling him the vision and him wearing our famous number 9 for many years to come will be enough to get him along with a big money contract! Let's face it will swoop whilst the current big boys are chasing Mbappe & Halaand
Martin Keown is a truely awful commentator!
If Liverpool play like this against Villareal they are going to come unstuck.
0:50 commentated is a Bayern Fan
Shoutout to Martin keown getting every offside call wrong even with replays and freezeframes
World record for most diss allowed goals?
Bayern ??????
0:50 is cut weird it goes 0:0 to  1;0 to 0:0 and back to 1:0
Var has ruined the game
Fair play to Benfica, they really made Liverpool shake a bit, fair play to the fans for making noise as well. Darwin Nuñez is gonna be scouted by many teams in the summer, Benfica shall go again next season. 🦅 fair play Liverpool.
Jesus Klopp has got some guts leaving out many of the main players in the quarter final of the Champions League. They were only 2 goals in front going into it..
Can anyone explain to me the stages of mitosis and what they’re called? (3marks)
Darwin come to Barca 🤣
Brilliant atmosphere from all 4 stands wow, kop and away stand were loudest though, I was singing the whole game another semi ❤❤❤🎉
The Red Jurgenaut keeps on rolling
Konate looking good 👍
Man of the match should go to the linesman that guy was a constant threat to benfica all game 🤣
Firmino played extraordinary today! I just wished he could've bagged that hat trick today! 😣
VAR was on Benfica’s side tonight
Klopp is looking tired recently, I wonder if he might take a break at the end of the season
Martin Keown is an absolute gerbil. Is that offside gerbil?
Liverpool and Man city was exhausted from the last h2h game? I expected they would have won at least.
Anybody notice that the commentator said bayern at 50 seconds
Fosgasse a nossa defesa e bem podre pa
"and of course, this'll be checked"  it would be much more fun if nothing was checked !
Weren't the Liverpool fans meant to hold those coloured papers as the players walk onto the pitch? English fans can't do basic choreographies 😂
City should sign Nunes.
Murderers
That last benfica goal was 100% offside! Whoever was on various tonight needs to get their eyes checked for real!
Liverpool would be stupid not to try and get Darwin nunez quality player him definitely knows where the goal is.
VAR ruining games as usual!!!
Liverpool's defence looked like the one that lost to Aston Villa 7-2.
Villareal will be a different type of game! I expect it to be hard!!! Unai emery must practice voodoo or sumit hes some boy! I see a liverpool city final brewing nicely
only top top teams go 3-1 up to benfica and end up drawing 3-3 👀 those top top teams will win a european comp this season watp 🇬🇧
if Benfica knew how to stay inside they could have chinned the scumbags
took your time with this upload
How many offside goals ???? lol
Konate is good
Darwin Nunez Man of the Match 🔥🔥
Nobody: Linesman’s when Benfica score: 🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳🏳
commentators blind ASF, so obvious the goals were onside xD
Darwin Nunez is going to evolve into some player.
What on earth is Liverpool’s defence doing 🤦‍♂️
Tsimikas is wild
Both elite English teams through and the media are looking for 100 ways to keep Manchester United relevant.
Keown is rubbish at calling offsides even after slow motion replays.
yessss bobby! well done
Why did the commentator call them Bayern just before Liverpool’s first?
Vlachodimos was simply awful
Linesman and co-commentator couldn't spot an offside if the lines were drawn for them anyways 🥴
That Nunez looks useful 😜
Good game...think Liverpool switched off a bit after going 3-1 up,but credit to Benfica
liVARpool
Martin keown is so good at spotting offsides
Darwin Nunez actually looks class, needs a bit of improvement on his offside
Nunes is quality 👏
Huge props to Tsimikas, has been an immense every start he’s had this season! 🇬🇷👏
Offside League games are the best 🤣
Let's buy nunez
The linesman’s flag has seen more action then I have also Benficas kit is nice
if none of the goals were diallowed then it would've been like 7-7 on aggregate. Fair play Benfica
Great Effort Boys!!!! Very Well done!!!!!! YNWA!!!!!!!!!!!
The comeback was never really on, Liverpool just took their foot off the gas and benfica where clinical. Even showed at the end if they needed at any time they could have turned it on and scored more. Credit to benfica for getting this far but it was always ending here. Teams like Madrid and Liverpool just seem to excel in the UCL.
Liverpools defensive IQ is just 🤩 to see how many offsides benfica had jurgen klopp managed them well
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.
Nooony ez is a bit tasty isn’t he
Inter, Benfica, Villarreal. LFC have had it very easy this year
my fave playa moe sola
Martin Keown Man.
Great match between Liverpool, Benfica and VAR.
Easy duz it Liverpool 😎
whens the next
sick game
I can see Tsimikas pushing Robertson hard next season.  They both get up and down the wing, and both can put a good ball into the box. I'd say Robbo is still the better player defensively, but not much in it going forward.
Benfica put up an unbelievable fight tonight. They made Liverpool struggle  at times.
Give the ball to Bobby and he will score🎶
commentators don’t know what offside is
Big balls from Klopp to field mostly his B team tonight... And still performed well. Could have backfired 😂
7:01 that slo-mo of Nunez running backwards, watching his goal go in, is cold 🥶
Fair play to Benfica. Not Liverpools first team but still a very strong side, they've got incredible depth. Benfica gave it a real go and deserve credit for scoring three at Anfield
Offside rule needs to be removed in modern football.
0:50 is it me or did he say Bayern
martin embarrassing himself with the offsides as usual
why can't er jusgget rid of city had them at thr weekend got at the weekend and again and now in the UCL semis 😐
Why can’t that second commentator not see straight lines? 😅
Phweee
0:18 klopp 💭 "Did I turn the oven off?"
I think it's real vs vivareal in final viva 2-1 Rma
Its liverpool's now!
Martin keown is phenomenal at offsides
How many offside goals?   Linesmen: Yes
I need to witness a European night at Anfield!!! YNWA boys
Praying for a Real Madrid remafch in the final❤️❤️🦁🦁🦁
If Darwin Nunez comes to the Premier League he has a real chance to be one of the best in the world, what a finish for both goals and he could have scored 4! And he could have eliminated Liverpool
to the people of france- the scousers are coming!!
While Atleti were trying to have a punchup with City, Liverpool and Benfica came for a game of footy
Vamoss Benfica come again next year very proud ❤️🦅
So lpools run to the final reads, inter milan benfica and villarreal, is this the europa conference league or the champions league 🤷🏼‍♂️😂
Darwin gave me Torres vibes 💫
Nunez, going 1 on 1 in his league and racking up goals in the CL as well. Only 22 years, some talent!
Firmino was Excellent tonight, having competition for places can only help him to become an even better player.
Good match👏🏻
Another konate header👏
So LIVERPOOL'S B TEAM still scored 3 against BENFICAS 1ST TEA?..
Fair play to Benfica they played really well tonight good luck to them for the rest of the season
What a match
Great to see Firmino scoring goals ! 😁
Respect to Benfica ✊ for putting the effort in and not giving up
What a game
I think it was a very intense match that had everyone on the edge of their seats kinda like the Chelsea vs Meal Madrid match also soooo good to see Firmino score and both teams deserved a win
0:50 didn’t know Benfica were Bayern
I know this was not Liverpool starting midfield but after City game on the weekend . This club have to sign 2 quality midfielders this summer , outside the top 6 they have the weakest on paper
Today showed that Liverpool's defence are actually human without Van Dijk 😅
There's just something about BT highlights of top quality games at Anfield, this gave me Liverpool Vs Barca vibes and so many others in the past few seasons
Really Really want Newcastle to Sign Darwin Nunez what a talented player.
We make things look easy 🤥⚽️ YNWA
So glad Bobby scored, he needed that after getting replaced by Jota. Great for his confidence
Klopp played the B team
Fraudulent Paper currency 0 - Gold 1000.
What a game, what a night, what a win!! 🔴🔴🔴
I can't believe I missed this! I missed Real vs Chelsea too 😅
Fair play to Benfica. Gave us a game. On to the semis!
Liverpool will win this year for sure! Man City will beat Real only to bottle the final AGAIN.
What a time to be a scouser ❤️❤️❤️
Nothing beats the atmosphere at Anfield on a European night. It’s something else
City vs Liverpool final 👀
Klopp took a team who where losing 6-1 to Stoke to there 3rd champions league semi final in 5 years what a job
Lfc on top
Liverpool to beat Real Madrid in the final.
why did the commentator refer to benfica as bayern lol
Manchester City will win the Champions league this season, they will beat Real Madrid and Liverpool or Villarreal in the final, it’s finally their year.
Up the fckin reds Paris here we come fckin get in YNWA
Tsimikas best second choice left back in the league. Would start for most teams. Great performance.
I'm not a Liverpool fan but they played really well!! Fair play.
I think the final will be yet another clash between city and Liverpool and I’m here for it
The fight of benfica was amazing tonight benfica should be proud regroup and come back next year
Hi
Bring in nunez
Respect to benfica for scoring 3 goals well played benfica.
Darwin Nunez is the next Edinson Cavani
Well done to both sides tonight, both very professional and never gave up - intriguing semi-final clash for Liverpool coming up, Villarreal will be much tougher than people think. 🙌🏻
some much better than city's game
24th
Second
It is unacceptable that Guardiola and the City players are scathing about Simeone's defensive playing style and are using the style of falling to the ground to waste time!!  Liverpool will always be clear
So so Glad we’re through but need some work defence wise , city or Madrid will punish us if we play like that
Respect to Benifica
IM ACTUALLY SURPRISED FIRMINO FINALLY SCORED AFTER A LONG TIME
Credit to Benfica coming from 3-1 down vs Liverpool at anfield was going to be a tough ask but they gave it a shot and played their part in making it a great game of football
As a Liverpool fan I got scared for a moment that they could’ve came back lol near the end
First comment! Smell it
Well done reds YNWA
What a game from both sides 👏🏻
Second
He may have lost his place to jota  But it’s great to see firmino still scoring  And he may not be first choice  But when he plays tsimikas always puts puts in a good performance- two assists
Second
What a game
