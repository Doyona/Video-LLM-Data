"I've never felt wind like th- IT'S HURTING MY TEETH" 😭😂
7:52 not a super baddie but definetly still naturally beautiful 😍
9:10 bad naton
With a thumb.nail like that, it's an easy decision to not watch the video and avoid this channel.
https://youtu.be/7b8QMcGfsvY?si=sRK8VyDy7ThJLn4z video on another ship:
When you met the second ship, it was filming a global video about the North Pole. Don't worry, you've been mentioned and featured in this video! https://youtu.be/7b8QMcGfsvY?si=sRK8VyDy7ThJLn4z
I've been watching you guys since I was in 6th grade, I'm about to finish high school right now and I LOVE YOUR CRUISE VIDEOS SO MUCH
All these comments about his damn hat, mind your own business, he's cleaned up and can clearly afford to go on all these expensive trips. The man can look however he pleases and yall will still watch.
They are so rich 😮
💖💙🥰
Out of all the videos you have made, this is the trip I would love to take. Alas, too expensive for a retired music teacher.😢
BRO THE FOOD IS FREE??
6:11 MUSTARRRRRRRRRD! 😂😂😂
I love how it’s WARMER at the North Pole than it is in Montana 🤣🤣🤣 they’re talking about a windchill of 10 and I’m like, what?
156 pounds! You making me feel fat considering I am 10 years younger but around 15 pounds heavier.
I thought the captain talking was Nate doing an accent 😂
I love how many adventurers you have done and I do some times get jealous of all of the amazing things you do ❤
$50.000 per person 😂.. even if Santa  🎅 was seating there waiting for me I would not spend that kinda money to see ice and water for 16 days lol
I rewatch your vids and these north pole ones are some of my favorites. You two are so funny that whole wind part was classic. "Nature" hahahah
Best indoor snowball fight ever ❤
that snow fight had to be the cutest thing ive seen in awhile
Never ever ever ever trust anyone wearing a mask
3:39
Im so watching this whole series!
Nate, wear your hat wherever you want. the "no hats inside" people are aboslite Karen's
Love it! All of it!
VPN DOESN'T PROTECT YOU FROM VIRUS. BIT DEFENDER TOTAL PROTECTION DOES. IT ALSO HAS A VPN, THAT WORKS GREAT.
the snowball fight was soo good! hahaha
You're on fire! Another awesome video. Loved every bit of it.
that looks so cool I would like to do that one it is on my bucket list
Nate you be you
never wearing gloves in winter, WOW :P
Where can you buy those snow parkas? I need one.
Hands down my favorite series on YouTube! these cruise ship videos are so dopamine rich!! I wish to one day afford a trip like this and invite a girl to come with me and FILM it all. Just like you guys.  P.S. Whos here in 2024 and have watched this like 7 times?
The Russian RosAtomFlot passing by smothly and comfidently like nobodys bussiness in a harshest terengt in the world
It must been the real good feeling to see another ship in the place like the North Pole where all you see when you look out is the ice . While that is very peaceful  I can imagen how happy feeling it brings for to see more life and that big majestetic russian icebreakers with loads of scientist omboard and the whole lot is just so good.  I seen a couple of icebreakers when I lived in Sweden and they are or were big. Some of them is now retired .    You get a feeling of respect them and happyness over what they do and can do...   Gives you such a security feeling and proundess over their work and courage it did to me.
Usualy there is scientis people from many coutnries on the ICEBREAKERS.
I just love how Nate picks on Kara like a schoolboy. The snowball fight would have angered many women. I just love their youthfulness. I hope they never lose that.
Wow amazing video 🇩🇰🙂
Just WOW! The minute you come across with the Russian icebreaker... made me unconsciously cry! Such emotional moment ❤
you guys have a really nice vibe, i like it!
I like how you brought up the phone / internet addiction. It’s very real & I definitely have it as well. We all do & I can’t stand it.
You saying you don't know for the knots . Is 42 is 50 to 80 wind Strength
Nate u look like Ronaldo
Lol I love this channel
This is so amazing ❤ty so much!
OMG What an Incredible video woooohooooo ❤
@12:30 do you know how easy y'all coulda been blown by the wind over the rail!?🌬. ✌
12:55  the wind was around 48.5 (48.33)  mph
This womans legs were shaped by the gods
Why am I crying when the two ships were together? It's so lovely to see people happy and wrlcoming 😊
3:03 i can relate to the food part bot not to the exresice one,im a lazy one [ i love ur vids <3 ]
Привет, есть здесь ещё люди, которые видели их на канале ТОПЛЕС?
You guys seem so friendly. I think a vacation with you would be the best
The UK gets 97mph of wind
14:36 greatest reaction ever :)
LOve your videos guys! one thig I've noticed, watching this the 2nd time round is that Nate gave Kara his jacket when they went out in the strong wind! what a gentleman :)
This looks so fun! I love your guys and Nate I am sorry about all those mean comments about your hat that’s not ok how rude there being❤
15:05
nice to see some love between the humans up north :D
Name of the cruise ship please. Thanks
You guys are my  favourite YouTubers ever my family travels a lot to
Amazing content, thank you for sharing!!
That dude dove for his life to pick up that cap. 😂
I Know English, Et français canadien
Je suis un Canadien français
U should come to Ireland 🇮🇪
Do you like when people get in your video cuz it sounded like you didn't like it
4:10 God damn Kara you have the prettiest eyes ever ;o;
O they were absolute cutties
I have just decided that I am going to live my life watching Kara and Nates vlogs..It is so satisfying that I feel like I am a part of this journey. This is as close I'm getting to the North Pole.
Idc that you wore your hat to dinner, honestly didn't notice it until you said it out aloud, just wear decent clothes like you've been doing that's plenty... cheers mate!
I want to go on a cruise sooooooo bad!!!!!!!!!😩😩😩😩
А ведь на ледоколе «50 лет победы» тоже находился один ютубер с командой…
fish beef chicken and pork../.................
hong kong singapore taiwan korea
why did u guys cover the apple logo on the laptop at 10:30? copyright?
Too cold Nah..
[Musica]
I looked up how much it cost to go on one , one day and its $30,000-$40,000 ! I guess this will be the closet i get to the north pole
10/10
I wanna go to the north pole to take pictures to show santa isnf real
the way the guy ran to get the cap for the olive oil
Please just take off your hat
hi
1 kiloes
Кто тоже из канала ТОПЛЕС?
Is there internet onboard?
Camera almost falls over at dinner table.😨 BEST VLOGGER CATCH EVER!😲😁
Did u meet santa?
Grox is the best
A children's expedition is on the Russian icebreaker
Wearing a hat in a dining room is rude and very poor manners, ESPECIALLY on a French or other NON-U.S. line.   People will immediately identify you as American!!   BTW, I am American.
I watch kara and nate every day to get my mood up 😂😂😂
Where do you book this?
That so epic,passing the other ship in north pole,Kara goes out in her robe😂 should have gone out in bikini,that would been stellar
Everyone waving and cheering at the end was so wholesome 🥺 what an amazing experience
If you have money everything is very SWEET :)
Kara has man calves.... not good.
I mean it’s cool but icebreakers are not the best…
Kate and Nate videos are always amazing and informative!   But the hat in the restaurant ....lol
Drink is free!!!!hahahaha Don’t forget you paid for it!!
Yayyyy for Tennessee , me to
it's incomprehensible that this video has so many dislikes ... to be honest ? you guys are representing the kind of relationship that I envy a lot nowadays. wish you all the best
Just don't end up like the HMS Erebus.
Hi. Can we see more of her in a bikini?
how can i go do this XD
What a terrible display of craziness - no one needs those ships, those people up there - Dijon mustard is a revelation? What a nutcase
How much is this cruis? Ballpark?
can you review the "On Running" shoes...you seem to have a bunch of them! keep up the good work!
Honestly it requires all my strength to not stuff my face when I have my hard workout weeks lol I do a lot of jogging and Vinyasa/Ashtanga yoga which is intense and even gained 10lbs because I am SOOOOO HUNGRY from all the exercise. Totally understand.
That must have been an amazing trip. I really enjoy watching you all’s adventures. Please be safe and continue your adventures ❤❤
What is the passenger capacity of that ship? It looks deserted.
IM GONNA PASS OUT MY NAN WAS ON THE OTHER BOAT I GOT A JACKET WITH IT AND SHE WENT LIKE 7-8 months ago OMG
Hearing you say bonjour with your retainer lisp was the funniest thing I’ve seen all day 😂 ❤
Where's the other cruisers? All I see is empty seats and staff.
I loved this video!  Was initially just planing to skip through it but it was great Also i love how you workout to eat! And the russian boat Also that you included your thoughts about your phone, reading, browsing, the food, the strong wind, the snowballfight and the sauna just everything about this video makes me wanna jump right on there and have a Journey with u
The gentlemen that literally sprinted for the olive oil cap… whatever he’s making $$$… he deserves a raise.
i cannot believe all the comments about his hat… i would’ve never even thought twice about that 🤣🤣
I wanna know what other questions were on your list to google once you were connected to internet again! 😂
Doesn't look like many ppl are on the ship ahha how much does something like this cost?
I would be afraid they hit an ice burg like the titanic.  But that's neat they snow room gets you prepared for plunge I did that one not at north pole but it was cold but neat once in a lifetime thing. I love yalls channel I live threw yall. I don't like the cold tho. They say cold baths are very good for you
Greeting of russian terrorists, well done! Next time please give them your ship, your bed, your life, because you are connected in a strange way as you mentioned. They will be very happy.
I cried when the boats passed
I've been Living Vicariously through you guys as a disabled person, keep it up! love your videos
I haven’t been able to watch in awhile (career change) and I am SO HAPPY I’m back. You both are such a joy and blessing. My heart is full this Saturday morning.
kara is by far the fakest human i’ve seen in my life time
I love watching you guys! Such an inspiration!
We are all humans and we have care for each other
What is cost of the ship
The rock is canaidian
🤌
having to take off hats indoors to show respect is such a funny social norm. 😅
You haven't had time to take your cap AT the table? Guy, you have gotten this cruise for free, the least you could do is being polite with your host, as they help you to create content. Is it that difficult to remember that you're not in Amerika?
What is amazing is you randomly have a Russian ship and a ..........well NON Russian ship passing each other where literally no one else is for a thousand miles and I guarantee you probably 99% of the people both ships combined disagree and are against the war in Ukraine!!!!!! The wrong people are running our governments!!!!!
Love watching you guys but do have to agree with the ‘hat’ in the dining room comments. Just a tad arrogant and you both seem to be so nice!
I hope that people who have bought cruise tour on the "50 let pobedi" icebreaker are sleeping well knowing that they sponsor russian terrorist attacks in Ukraine. every day russia is bombing ukrainian peaceful cities. because they have money to do this! it is happening right now when you're reading this! just stop make business with them to stop this genocide of us, ukrainians! please
Заметили, что это самый просматриваемый из серии про северный полюс? Это все фанаты топлес💙
camera quality is so nice. kara's pretty
why are ppl still wearing masks, enough of that nonsense
when it shows 10pm it’s so light! like i would not be able to sleep…..
bruh the way i cringed when i saw the comments telling him off for wearing a hat like he went into the restaurant with swimming trunks 💀💀💀💀
did you find santa
Did you see Santa ? Why don't u try surviving in a desert
fuck my life
what is the exact itinerary? Or what is the itinerary called?
Привет из России )))))
Long time watcher first time commenter - just have to know where my gf and I can get those sleek supple black jogger sets, love how they look on Kara and Nate! Any help appreciated thanks!
The point where you hit that ice and the boat tip was crazy! Wow!!! I have never seen this before! One thing would love to know is how much this actually cost you guys as me and my husband really want to do it one day!  Also, will check out the links, but would be cool to see if you guys got a discount or any hacks on this.  As well as you made me laugh so hard kara when you could not get out of the ice room for a moment thought youbwere locked in - that would send me into panic mode as well lol! 🤣
I subscribed to your channel and have been watching all of them!! I looove them!  Kara, you are such a kind, sweet person!! You two are very cute!! Look forward to watching many more!! Take care and be safe!
do u pay for the food
Broooo your from Tennessee! I'm from Texas, a backwards cap is the small town top hat of today🎩
I love this channel so much <3
Was that Hotel California on the violin ?
I am 56 years old and my daughter gave me my 1st EVER cell phone. (Christmas gift) Yep, 1st one. Apple 12 and it was her old phone b/c she got a newer one. And to say that I am intimated and lost on how to use the thing, is an understatement. But the world, will force you into, it's mold. Sad
$45k a head to sail on on that Russian ice breaker.
I think the magnetic North Pole is like ok the earth is sourounded by magnetic fields and that’s the northern lights so I think that’s the closest you can get to the magnetic field
Nate, what is your height in cm?
Nice trip. Do they not serve any good food? Hamburgers, BBQ, steaks, chili, etc?
You know that country of the the ship has invaded Ukraine? Killed thousands of people? You were happy to meet them? So embarrassing.
Where is the  john snow
3:00 YES!!! I can relate to you omg 😍😍😍
Just cut the carbs and you wont have to worry about calories at all.
The two ships warms me
How much did his cruise cost u...
Her eyes so pretty
This is best Chanel I just discovered!
Am i the only one wondering how much 16 days on a ship like that costs ?
Super cool!
You have nice eyes.
Closer and closer
Are you kidding?
Congrats you get paid to show how you do nothing besides leech resources and people's time. Go away
What is the point of going there?
I would of gave her at least 2 inches in there
Kara definitely looks like she's starting to get a little middle age pudge on her, no matter how hard she tries to fight it....
It's so nice to see both ships together
in 10 years we'll be watching a netflix documentary about how these two got murdered
What was that vacation u went on. Looks like fun would like to do it with my wife
Yes on the workout to eat hungry when I exercise
5:45 the server in the background ran to pick up that dropped cap, bless his heart 🙃
love the snow room
Gosh, you two are having lots of fantastic experiences, thank you for sharing those cool stuff AND FOR THIS EXPERIENCE IN PARTICULAR
There are ships breaking ice out there while the rest of us are being blamed for global warming. It makes no sense
why am i tearing when two ships meet and greet each other?!
hou much is cost this trip ??😱😱😱😱
Almost threw up there
Does anyone know the name of that gym machine which was “broken”? Thanks
The coolest shit I’ve ever seen
I would be afraid of the snow room door freezing shut
i was watching with my little cousin and she has asked me to let you know to say hi to santa for her 😂❤
I’m a big fan of seeing these one of things, I would be nerding out if I saw that Russian ice breaker from that close! That is such an insane and rare thing to ever see
omg how can u eat soooo much??????
So many russian terrorists are writing something in the comments
You both are doing great job guys , I already have seen your journy visting south pole n i think this journy is the same
ha! I wondered about your perfect teeth (my son is getting braces soon) keep wearing your retainer at least a few nights a week forever! I regret stopping wearing mine when I was pregnant and had to eat in the night, now my teeth have separated, not bad, but not as good as they were.  my son's orthodonist said to keep wearing your retainer until you are ready to no longer have perfect teeth.  wish I had know that.  also, love your videos.  I went back to watch the old ones because you mention how bad they are.  and I don't know why they are so much worse, but you have improved a lot over the years.  thanks for the adventures from this person that perfers to be at home!
Y’all I’m trippin out about polar bears being in the middle of the ocean. Idk where I though they lived but it wasn’t all the way out there😅
Sure wish you would clean your lens. A big dot in the middle of most of your shots.
Where can I get more info about this cruise?
Oh I am loving your videos! Your videos of going to the north pole are epic thank you for sharing
Are those Filipino Chef I've seen on the Pantry? 😲Wow!!!
Kids when u get to the north pole where's santa
Why is that I feel like most of the crew are Filipinos?☺️
to skip the sponser 7:33
You’re on a Ponant cruise!?!? I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and they have a cruise that goes to Canada and around the Great Lakes from our lakefront harbor. Luxurious indeed…
Hi from Russia
I know this sounds weird but i would be tempted to jump off because its just like I can’t explain but i love snow but thats not why i would be tempted it would be because i never saw anything like the seanery
I love Japanese blogger…mostly they focus camera on subjects, stuffs, landscape etc…they barely shows or never, there face…the other blogger 80%  talking toooo much facing camera….
19:11 It's nice, everyone met each other, despite the situation in the world  :)
It's so funny to see two Americans so much excited on the idea that in fact there is a whole world outside the US..
You guys are the best! ❤
Hi Kara! Super random question lol, what’s the brand of your training shoes?
I’m sorry but you will not be able to see Santa…
Welcome to being in the Navy. NO INTERNET!!
You DEF still should NEVER be wearing a HAT WHILE YOU ARE EATING BRO.  Shows a lack of respect for yourself and Kate!!
Hi from TOPLES
Pink Floyd - Shine on you crazy diamond https://youtube.com/shorts/nk2pj7_0zB8?feature=share
20:00 there is a Russian blogger "toples" on this icebreaker😁
why does the coffe machine sound like an air compresser
5:48 Man sprints like his life depends on it. :)
Gym or not, hats off lol
Ya'll are too cute!! The impromptu snowball fight after sauna was wholesome af and made me LOL.. I really have come to enjoy every video, relatively new subscriber still binging my way thru!! Love you both and wish you nothing but the absolute best!!
I love how your questions show the difference of depth your conversations have been also.
Masks... on a cruise ship... in the north pole... presumably after a negative test...
I would think the ship would sink like the Titanic
The two ships meeting was so awesome and must’ve been so special
Im probably too late with this comment for you guys to see it, but I saw you guys still use tape to cover your macbook logo, why dont you guys get some nice stickers of your logo made to permanently place over it?  Just a thought.  Keep up the great vids and Go Vols!
The trick is to undercook the onions [ploop]
The waiter running for the lid so she dosent have to get it 😊❤
Wish I had a partner life sucks being alone
5:46 he ran for that lid like he was gonna rescue a baby from a fire that’s service
At first I was a bit confused about the meeting of ships and then I realized that it was a Russian ship and people are commenting from Russia and the people on the other ship waving and saying hello was so magical and swing the comments are also special, so heartwarming.
This costs 31000 dollars? Wow
I love your loving dynamic which you two have--especially shown in the Snow Room where you guys had a snow fight!  You both have lots of fun all of the time on your adventures! 👏💓
You two are in the best shape ever. Keep up the teamwork. 👍
Ниче такая  встреча)
people from U.S: kilos?.... the rest of the world: TY FOR USING STANDARD UNITS
I see Filipinos on board. Wohoo
as somebody who has a very close heart to the cold this looks absolutly wonderful, im from sweden and we're pretty far up in the north but not quite as far at the north pole! i can imagine its really cold there. this cruise does look like a very nice place to be in that climate tho, so luxurious!!
I just first time on this channel, and can say following:  - How much show off has this video? - Yes  And dislike for russian icebreaker greetings
Привет из России🤍 19:09
Wear your hat inside all you want. Hopefully it makes people mad.
3,000,000 plus views. Hmmm… Thumbnail of Kara in bikini gets more views. 👍🏼👍🏼
Snowball fight was the cutest thing ever 😊😊
Привет с канала (ТОПЛЕС)!! Вас там тоже засняли) Hello from (ТОПЛЕС) channel!! You were also filmed there)

привет от Топлеса
Great production value for a vlog. You can tell you two put a lot of errort into this. Wonderful use of nats sound.
Hi from Yan

Привет от Топлеса
There were schoolchildren on the Russian ship. There is a video on the Topless channel about the Arctic
Привет вам с канала Топлес, именно он был на российском ледоколе

19:10 you met Russian schoolchildren who went on a trip for free :)
There was a russian youtuber and vlogger Yan from TOPLES channel on the 50 years of victory ship. The episode from their trip just arrived on his channel some days ago, it's more a scientific and documentary video showing us the history, crew members stories and how certain things work. Also he made a proposal to his gf while being in the center of the Northern Pole, truly amazing.
Hello from Toples <3

Это видео должно было быть связью между абсолютно разными народами с разной культурой. Но обиженные украинцы и тут испортили впечатления от наших соседей по исследованию Северного полюса

Если от Топлеса 19:20
THANK YOU FOR CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE! YOUR KIDS WILL BE PROUD!
what a waste of energy and resources
Shame on you
I wouldn't go in the snow room cause that reason snowball fight lol
into the sauna you don't wear swimming suits but only towel
I dont care about cap off, but this facemask???? WOW stop with this facemask and covid fraud
Just wondering that no one is interested, how much it costs It's just interesting
а где остальные туристы? или это лайнер на двоих?
Lmao :D The humanity is really fucked up :D Going to north pole without the fun... just on cruise ship as tourist... same as going to Everest with big team and air support... even without taking your bag by yourself :D
🤩❤️❤️❤️
It sound like they need to up their entertainment game.
What is the name of the drone pls
I started googling her questions because I'm curious
Let's burn 5 tons of CO2 to visit the Artic ice before it's all gone due to global warming, yeah 🥳
I really enjoyed seeing you two smiling, relaxed and happy through the video 😄
pre par ludi sa spotrebuje tolko energie ako pre male mesto a to len preto aby sa mohli tocit na YT a zarabat peniaze. tieto plavajuce molochy su ekologicka katastrofa. mrzi ma ze som klikol na toto video a nechtiac ho podporil
most people here for thumbnail
form Indonesia 🥰
you met rob, wondering where he's been.
This kind of cruises is why the world will end
Here we are. The icecaps are melting, life on the poles is dying off. One of he main reasons being: emissions from ships such as this. So my question is: how on earth are doing this cruise with a clean conscience?
I really liked your videos, but shame on you for going on a cruise ship
Why is there a cruise ship to the North Pole? It’s causing so much damage over there to the animals, the ozone and especially to the icebergs. As if they aren’t already to an all time low and this ship just causally breaks them as it proceeds
I’m going to admit I clicked on the video because there was a fit girl in a bikini and curious but I fell in love with you guys so don’t worry I won’t snatch er up and became a sub instead lol 🎉
If I was on this boat and I see the other ship, I'm flipping middle finger!! LMAOOOO
Would love to know how much something like this cost. Would love to be able to do it in the next few years if possible but I have a feeling it will be an easy 10k+
2:45 flexible brunette amateur making yoga
A complete climate catastrophy
u guys have the best life
Lol people really got mad for him wearing a hat. There are so many other things people need to worry about..ahhahah
❤
WOW, 50 years of victory, what a meeting! A nuclear icebreaker, of course, it is not intended for cruise flights, according to its design. And I took it in St. Petersburg at the factory and we distilled it to Murmansk. Greetings to all from a sailor from Murmansk))
would fk here
Thanks for the video! Like it, esp. the snow fight in a bikini! No need for me to think about polar cruise any more, as almost everything can be done so easily & much cheaper right here in Canada. Oh, yeah!
These cruisers should be banned. Nothing to be celebrate about.
You people live in a fairytale
lol 5:24 the couple looks scared to be in the shot. like huddle in the corner.
goodnight , que foda que mandava na sauna ^^
Shackleton is rolling over in his grave.
Sorry kara, but your Tennessee-an came out when you said “bon-jour” 😆😆🥰🥰🥰
Amazing environmentalists arent screaming about this. As a non environmentalist even I get enraged seeing sauna rooms, dumping toilets, ships inward production of warmth radiating outward into surroundings, slow oil and fuel drips from grinding forwards, plus a hundred other things that is just like why.   Why because your bored and probably want to feel good about yourself bc you did a thing w pictures of colot contrasting images to show others like this video, to bring that machine there. Do it on foot with the thousands of guides like all the people who wondered what it was like to go and see there.   Psychotic you don't know what that ships footprint is in the north pole versus not being there is
only clicked to seee kara in bikini
48 knots is 88KM
This video is everything that is wrong with humanity.
that behind me is a heated pool..
The staff member rushed to pick up the cap like it was his duty to not allow kara to pick it up. This is hospitality on an other level.
what a shitshow
Its looking really great and different experience. Would love to know how much does it cost and where to book from ?
But why
That sauna is definitely not hot enough.
What a waste of energy at the expense of our environment and our climate
why are you cheering on those russian orcs?
Yes, correct choice not picking the soviet nuclear icebreaker, even modern ships still don't use proper nuclear particle shielding.
You're so lucky to have found such an amazing woman!
Holy cow my heart actually starts fluttering at 9:40, and I quickly remember they couldn't upload if they're trapped.
9:17, hey, sometimes you don't know until it happens
Kara, I'm a fitness professional and that is also 100% my main reason to workout. Because I absolutely love food
So we are doing a cruise where we break up the ice of the north pole, while we are worried about the ice melting... How is this not a an environmental disaster, created by humans, for leisure?
какая же она шикарная милфа
You wonder why there isn't any polar bear at sight ? Just for info, 20 years ago there was plenty. If today there is none, it is because of people like you not taking their environnemental responsibility. Thank to you that drive us in a futur world with +8C° on summer
We are in 2022, climate issues are razing up, and there is still people making THE MOST POLLUTED HOLIDAY on earth. Even worse, they are proud to do so.
im coming next time
People are uptight about wearing a hat inside or at a restaurant. DON'T GET MRE STARTED!!!
This is your best video. Such a unique trip. I loved it. Especially when you guys saw the other boat.
Oh my god, the price for this is insane lol
I really enjoy watching your YouTube adventures. Thank you for sharing them with us. You are so fun and interesting to see. God bless you
That has got to be one of the worst cruises out there haha
this honestly looks like a dream, just fantastic! but as i was watching i found myself wondering, isnt the breaking of the ice bad for the animals living there? and what would happen if there was an animal in the direction the cruise was going in?
I am dazed from the dazzle of decadence and constantly reminded of death.
Gobal warming and we have "Cruises to the north pole". No wonder the world is f**ked. Do you know just how much fuel these thing consume?  a Mazda MX5 (miata) can drive 1050miles to 1 mile on the smaller style cruse ship or 1750miles vs large cruise ships.
This is very good, thank you for sharing this with the world
I cannot think of something dumber than this cruise when we re in full blown climate crisis
Just Wow! We are litterly destroing our Planet with melting down the poles and u r doing a trip to it with a cruise ship to make it even worse. That is the bigst joke ever.
Making a Trip with one of the worst CO2 footprints possible enjoying exactly what CO2 is destroying.
Fantastic journey, well worth it.
destroying the pristine arctic for the sake of social media likes... this is exactly how human civilization ends.
Mate take your hat off.
Wearing a mask that there is no scientific evidence that it is protected makes me disgust to keep looking. What a pity
Eco friendly :D
Nice masks losers
Pretty wild to see people taping up Apple Logos on their Macs. Its a fucking trillion dollar company. get over yourselves.
And then the world shouts out for climate change.  Keep up the ice-breaking and have more harsh summers + forest fires + water shortage.
Just shows how taking away the governmental aspect will show you how the civilian population really feels about others.  As the pausing of the Russian and French ship to cheer each other.  We could all learn alot from this.
Nate looked like he was Michael Jackson because of the wind
Training to eat more? reminds me of people vomiting up their food at festivals in ancient rome to make rome for more
This is how insane my emission-rich western life style must look like to average people from, say, Pakistan. Completely bonkers.
yeah, take a look at the arctic before she is no more .. from a cruise ship... gosh
As soon as they remove the poison 🚫 from the compulsory vaccination ⛔⚠, I will also go to one
best wishes
So this trip was $80k???
Rodney made the cut! "You can tell it is a spruce tree, because that is what it is" - Neature Time is the best content ever created.
ok
What time is it in the north pole when all lines of longitude meet there and that's how we go by time. Every 15 degrees.
wow...you know people stay in the sea up here fishing.... I been 20 year on a longliner.  Its cold,but its a work
True love still lives
https://youtu.be/y837qD_AO6Q
The way that he was walking remind me of that music video Michael Jackson
can't get out of snow room. in america, we have bars for push and handles for pull.... and people act like we are always the dumb ones.
Why in the world would you make a video advertising a $40,000 trip to your subscribers you got for free. Careless and senseless.
I'm so jealous!!
Your videos are great and are fun to watch.  But I couldn't help but thinking while watching how you should give many thanks to climate change for making this trip possible!  It would be nice if you guys committed to donating all the money you make from these videos to the people in Pakistan whose lives are being destroyed by catastrophic floods at the same time that these videos are being posted.
Sauna with their swimsuits on? never seen that before :D looks like a nice view tho
highlight of the journey is a russian ship, loved this, specially in these times  wish we just could all get a long
TRANSLATOR DEVICE for other languages
I see you finally found out, that if you put Kara  as a thumbnail with little to no clothes on, you get more likes.... its stupid.. but it works.. and its sad.. that just means that people aint here for the content..
rich get richer. always.
Global warming, melting glaciers and poles… and people go on a cruise with sauna to the north pole. Still dont know if this is more sad or retarded.
I also was just talking about how we use muscle memory on our phones and when my screen went black I was still able to use my core apps, crazy how I'm not the only one lol 😅
That snow ball fight definitely got me rolling 🤣 😂
He reminds me of Renaldo ⚽️
Awww.. such a nice way to ruin the planet! :)
a place further than the universe
holy smoke the ship is incredabile
yeah so fun ... you gotta go fast to visit the icebergs with a cruise ship... because there wont be anymore of them soon (totaly not because of people like you guys)
Don't you guys have a kid? Who watches the baby while you two are off adventuring?
no offence but i feel like if this cruise were to break down and you all got stranded on the ice, you two would be the first to get eaten.  I dont know why, its just a gut feeling.
I like the chance encounter with the Russian icebreaker 50 Years of Victory.  Yet with the difficulty entering Russia by air from pretty much anywhere but a Middle-Eastern country or territory, entering the North Pole from a Western country is so much easier these days.
Hello, men of culture!
So this is a 25 minute video of.. what two rich people do on a fancy boat. And people watch this?
How many passengers does this ship carry?
Here because of Ludwig :c
30-40k for this trip dam sure is expensive
Sup wit da hat bro? You aint in da hood nomore.
Hi all At 19:28, a Russian icebreaker is carrying talented schoolchildren on its second tourist flight in 2022 from the North Pole For them, this trip is free, as well as on the first flight)) I was on the third flight, reached the north pole on August 6, 2022 On the way back we went to the Franz Josef Land archipelago with a landing on one of the islands Fantastic trip! Link to the second trip with children (meeting the French icebreaker at 12:24) https://youtu.be/nn1v7OrIPkI?t=744
This has to be the most excessive and wasteful thing to do. Harming the environment for what purpose?
@8:07 no hair down there
21000 € for 14 days holy shit
Of course the lady in underwear has to be on the thumbnail.
Imagine going in to the sauna with your swimming stuff on you lol yes breath in all that poison hahahah
If you want to know how good the quality of service is after Kara dropped the cap he literally ran to pick it up before her.
Kara please share your exercise routine. How do you get your lean strong body…?!
Wow, a Neature Walk reference? I love it. Thanks for sharing, stedda just Kara and Nate knowin' about it.
Please learn some sauna etiquette. Without towels is Unhygienic and a little bit disgusting.
And yet the rich ppl want the poor people to change their lifestyle to help reduce global warming. shm. don't fall for their traps ppl.
50 years of victory goes to 90 degree exactly
Here is a video from the Russian Ice breaker!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBP4-k5n_8A&ab_channel=RealReporter  You chose wisely.
12:00 in which country the time is 17 : 59 ?  In north pole you enter different time zones in a short time :)
omg Kara girl, you are so flexible!!
Thanks for destroying our Planet with that massive polluter
how to naivly destroy the future
This is so cool. The wildest thing to me is that, in the middle of this desolate place, with no human beings for miles and absolutely no amenities, there is a floating sauna where you can get saffron pasta
why goin on a cruise in the arctic? isnt it destroyed enough already?
Disgusting!
$43k CDN for the trip! What a steal!
how much does this trip cost all up?
I definitely clicked on this video because I'm interested in your life and not for any other reason
The titanic could never
I'm gonna wear my hat more often while dinning out just in spite of the puritans.
I love knowing how u could freeze to death outside and u pop back in side and appreciate the warm and enjoyable things in life way better than sweating non stop in 40* heat
I dont normally give much a shit about the whole plastic and destroying the ocean crap, but you got to respect the captain for purposely avoiding the ice and not just cutting straight through it.
~17 minutes in = internet detox !! I just know EXACTLY what you mean! Some things we just take for granted, and when that just isnt available... Gahh, took me a good 3-4 weks before that almost compulsive behavior left my system, Almost always when i visit my wifes home country of Mongolia we usually leave the cities to travel far outside any inhabited area and you literally have no  phone reception or even electricity, unless you have a car and use  the cigarette lighter plug or have some sort of solar power ! And you are far away from any help if you hurt yourself. A wonderful country with wonderful people. Hope to go back soon.
Ships library
14:37 Nate’s face when the camera fell🤣🤣
How do you justify destroying the nature and polluting the world, yet claiming you love the nature?
Don’t give a shit if you wear a hat or not you paid to be there wear what you want
Ahhhh...spoiled kids
Interesting to see that he still doesn’t think it’s wrong to wear a hat at a restaurant. I never saw the old video he mentioned where he wore one but, Nate, if you see this hear me out. You might not have been brought up in a place where wearing hats at the dinner table is inappropriate and that’s totally fine. However, in a lot of Europe and some parts of the States it is considered rude. You don’t have to live your life worried of offending the delicate sensibilities of each and every person, but i would consider folding on this one..
Thank you for destroying the environment you selfish a....
how much did this cruise cost you guys ? I'm curious now if just anyone can decide to go or if its just select groups.
Beer on sauna rocks > aromatic oils. Try it!
Yeah this is totally cool for the environment and climate no worries
kind of creepy to put a girl in a bikini as the thumbnail. maybe that's just the standard for YouTubers.
No polar bears ? :D of couse because of people like you, there will be no polar bears ever again
Yeah super cool going on a luxury cruise to the north pole. Super necessary as well. Some places do not need tourism.
Clicked on it for the screen capture.  Then she keeps her clothes on for like the whole video.  0/10.
more adds u fokin need
I guess this is good for climate change....
which cruiser is this?
I hate to ask, but from my own research it seems this cruise came nowhere near the actual geographic north pole. According to their website, the trip takes passengers 700km away from land at a 90 degree angle towards North, and yet the distance between Longyearbyen and the geographic north pole is approx 1300km, or nearly double the 700km journey. So what's going on, why would you pay 30,000 euro for going to the north pole when you're not actually going to the north pole?
$20k per person for that trip!!! Only rich people can afford that holy hell.
screw the hat haters lol.
16:45 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨
Seeing that boat really just goes to show you how not so fucked up we humans are. We genuinely care about each other. The media tries to tell us otherwise. It's also classic to wave at another boat going by.  In this case a masice ice breaker cruise ship to the North Pole hahhaa
4:30 - why does this make me so mad?
Hahahaha Kara crying at the other ship
Kara doesn't even know her own strength  breaking gym equipment lol
I love you guys so much!!! You guys are amazing!! Love the aditude
I wanted to go on this cruise but when I found out it’s $80,000 for the room, I just put it at the back of my mind and just enjoyed the views LOL. 😂😭
I love watching y'all. Nate bringing Kara coffee in the morning STILL is so cute and wholesome.
U have to break the ice to reach the North Pole?? Isn't that...really bad? Melting ice is already a big issue without people sending ships through it to break the ice
Impromptu snow fight cracked me up XD
I don't even want to know how expensive this must be.
white bread
People still get offended by wearing a hat in the dinning room? Grow up already :D
"Polar bear sight seeing" lol.. These animals are actually going extinct because of people like you doing touristy cruise ship luxury "adventures".
How much is it? All that space, barely people around. It looks like it would be expensive.
This is extremely polluting to th environment just for some 1% Snobs to enjoy their wealth. People that likely have enough money to just dont care about the consequences of their doing.  Please stop polluting the atmosphere w hundreds of tons of CO2 just for jour enjoyment.   It looks cool and the video is extremely well made but i just cannot support its content.
thats the most unheated sauna ive ever seen
Someone should show this video and cruise to flat earthers that think the north pole is off limits to keep people away from the "giant ice wall"
Seems like a good way to destroy the North Pole.
16 Days €37,389  Fuck me.....
alright, you got my like for the "neature" reference lmao
This big cruise must destroyed the eco system even faster in north pole. Polar bears cannot find a big enough ice to rest on after swimming hours... but this big cruise ship breaks all ices when passing by... why do we have go there just because food are nice in cruise and we are running out of places to have fun??
So you would go on a russian ship while they are raping and murdering? Just found this channel, wont be coming back.
if you hit an ice berg, let Nate share the door please
yes, i will also add my 2 cents worth. men wearing hats indoors and especially at a table is RUDE. dirty hair, combed sweaty hair is much more acceptable. wearing a hat at the table is considered disrespectful...........i hate it when i see persons doing that
yes just go ahead and promote breaking up the polar ice in your polluting cruise ship just so you can touch the facking north pole.
Tell me you're rich without telling me you're rich.
where are your kids?
Great....  so we destroy the planet and now bring polluting luxury cruises to enjoy the catastrophe we've created whist sipping whine and looking on from our outdoor hot tub.  Nothing against you two specifically, but the whole concept is disgusting.
The catch with the Russian ship is that it's cheaper but you can ever leave Russia and they will likely throw you in prison at the end of the trip.
No wonder Cristiano Ronaldo isn't scoring any goals at ManU. He's spending his time at the freakin' northpole!
Why are they all so happy about the Russian ship passing by? Thought everyone hated russians in all kinds of forms
02:43  BBC is her reason
Very nice! You can see the damage that you do inmediatly in front of you’re eyes! Life ice melting how cool is that!
nice click baity crap...piss off!!
A really nice trip, with a really nice couple. I'd like to be in board while  you are there.
Dude looks a bit like Christiano Ronaldo
оо
Are  you allowed to keep the Jacket?
Think about this comment when your old and the north pole is no more due to people like you promoting things that are destroying our world as it is. :)
Oh yeah, we're burning thousands of gallons of diesel to watch the icebergs melt. Very sustainable, very eco-friendly :(
nobodies show their lives, who cares? Losers?
Remember the days when people profited off their romantic trips together? Oh wait they didn’t,people used to just take pictures and share their memories with their family….
We love your series and I have just a goofy question: Why hide the logo on the laptop?  I've seen it in TV shows and YouTube episodes, and am just not sure of the exact reasoning.  And thanks for all the entertainment!
How much cost the tour
am i just watching rich people do rich people things
This should be illegal how can a massive ship like that breaking all the ice go to the North Pole not for Scientific exploration
Its rude to wear a hat in a restaurant. You must be american.
Still with the phuking mask 😆😆🐑🐑
Kara I’m wondering what workout do you do I rly wanna know
I hate cruise ships. Dirty machines which speed up the destruction of the world even faster.
You can watch the ice melt real time. Many people have the false assumption that cruising is greener than flying. While both emit pollution into the atmosphere, cruise ships are far worse. Per passenger, per mile, a cruise emits almost double the carbon dioxide. Cruise ship emissions are also harmful to marine environments and its inhabitants.
i see on the internet the red shiff cost like 24k for 13 days
climate
What is this bullshit. Everything is wrong on this kind of tourism.
Sorry dude, but even in a deep country southern Bojangles, you should still remove the hat. Just remember, a hat is a fashion accessory, not an excuse to go out with nasty hair. IMHO.
More pics of Kara in a bikini. Nice thumbnail, y’all know what you guys are doing.
"15 mins in sauna" *Laughs in Finish*
great idea for upload, but would never go on such a cruise. waste of money IMO, less sense is only in cruise on the submarine :)
Looks to me there was nothing to do there, except the awesome views. Everything else was like living in a home. nothing special
Was it necessary to mention russians? No respect to your followers from Ukraine
у чювака слишком белые зубы, это не нормально
30 is the new 15.
If i had a wife as pretty as Kate id put her in the thumbnail too.
@17:07 And that is the reason i dont have anything really on my phone. No facebook, only my second email for important stuff(which is linked to my main email, so dont have to check it), no account on youtube(well.. got youtube premium but its for youtube music only), and i never use instagram or tiktok.  All i got is a reading app which i use during breakfast/lunch breaks to read books. Dont even have games on it.. PC MASTER RACE! *ahem*.
nice👍👌🏻
it is nice to see N-pole. I have a question....is it really necessary to travel N-pole burning a lot of oil and gases? is it environment friendly? Is it important to disturb nature around in N-pole?
Where is the bikini lady?
It seems paradox to go to the North Pole on a cruise ship - a place that is also endangered because of the pollution of such cruise ships... Just a thought...
Our friend did that cruise for their 20th honeymoon $35,000  each.
Bro, don't pimp out your wife on the thumbnails like that.
I just keep coming back to this video. The way you vlog is mesmerizing. Love this!
Hat at a restaurant on a cruise YOU paid for …. I see no problems there😂
She lays in bed? What does she lay in bed?
0:01 "we are currently burning tons of CO2, to see the last patch of ice before ppl like us destroy it"
I came here for the feet.
North Pole Cruise from $37,160 per person.... Never going to happen for the average Joe.  Entertaining video though.
5:46 the guy was so quick xD
These fking icebreakers are a major factor in the north pole melting! Stop this!
Wow what a fantastic trip!!
Absolute and utter consumerism. Its disgusting that people don't give two shits about nature and climate. Heated pool on a north pole? Are you fucking kidding me?
putain , baguette, vin rouge , fromage ! :D
That´s probably among to most stupid shit you can do right now. RIP Planet earth.
I feel sorry for flat earthers since they can't never go there...
Where can I find information as to what cameras you guys were using they took fabulous footage would love to know what equipment and where purchased if possible. I am sure amazon sell it as well
A thought for North Pole. 😢
Thank you guys for sharing! I am definitely putting this on my bucket list :) my kind of cruise!
Now you know what sauna means to finnish people.We have over 2 million saunas.
Why on earth do you go inside a sauna wearing a bikini, eg. swimmshorts??? You have to be naked inside.. This is ridiculous! Or is it just because you Americans are afraid of almost anything? :)
I wonder what the impact of your cruise on the local environment is there
Damn, starting price of 30.000 euro per person for a two week holiday......
My god, how much did this cost?
Since when do you wear clothes in a Sauna?
I JUST got off this today - I am premiering my first episode in a few hours on my channel.  Kara and Nate - I hope you watch mine also!  Did you love Charcot?  Captain Garcia was our captain.  Stella (observatory bar) says hello!  :). They said your ship had a TON of Russians!
people so happy to see russkiy voenniy korabl... 🤦‍♂
yall were 15minutes in the sauna and didnt come out steaming hot 😭
Would love to know who the chef is with that amazing food!
The carbon footprint of this journey must be off the chart
Great quality video to a destination I can only make here through you (mainly for 🥶 Ts), so thanks about your lovely and PRO description!  I’ve a question, regarding my second point I can’t do such a cruise, NATURE related: don’t you think that breaking all that ice could also break or kill some local equilibriums, or even destroy some animals ecosystems??!??
The  fresh sidecar temporarily lock because gear operationally satisfy down a willing cornet. ill-informed, lying second
You know it’s fancy when they have lululemon yoga mats
Stop talking about food. Stop talking about exercise. Find some counseling. You know the cafeteria serves recycled food - leftovers - on cruise ships
Nice ! But learn to dress for snow ! Nos socks in the front deack, in running shoes ? LOL ! -12 is not ... cold when you wear the right stuff... ! #quebecbord
Which cruise line is this?
Classic French captain
I know you two know that masks do not do a damn thing other then HARM you. Take them off and be an example
Best YouTube video I have ever watched🤓
It's that for me, my day to day life involves the phone and social media and the web but when you can you should live in the moment and enjoy what's right in front of you.
You two are just the best!!!  Passing the other ship was just waaaay too cool.
how much does a trip like this cost?
“Tell you I hate the environment without telling you I hate the environment”
good idea  break the ice help it melt quicker !  Enjoy your pancakes
I really can't understand that in these times of climate changes, some young people need to use a touristic boat to visit the North Pole. What's the goal ? I can't understand the need to travel everywhere on this planet, more times a year.... Can't you simply explore your country, your region, your neighbourhood ?  There SOOOOO many video on YT of SOOOOOO many places on the planet... Why should people nowdays need to get in person at these places, to finally simply take a picture and share it to their friends ? A trip for about 1 or 2 days, often sleeping in the same hotel brand.... I don't get it.
Bro if people get upset about you wearing a hat at the dinner table people would HATE living in the south (or at least the area I live in) we wear our hats wherever we want
Lets destroy the world together 😍
Should those cruises brake through the ice like that? I mean, we been complaining about icebergs breaking apart.
this woman is way too American. My gosh I could not finish. Couldve been a nice vlog otherwise.
is kara older than nate?
The crew looks filipino
If only these were a bit less than 35k euro minimum.
Looked up the cruise...wish I had $40k per person to go on something like that.
Bruh, how crazy expensive must this be? Look at those breakfasts and lunches
Cost is $50,000 PER PERSON???
And the point of going to the North Pole was???
Russia  is killing Ukrainian women and children. You should not have celebrated! GLORY TO UKRAINE!
Cruisen on a ship which is one of the reasons for climate change  with ice melting and wondering why there r no ice bears...
I wonder why they heated the pool
I hope this wasn’t filmed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine
Yea that sauna looks amazing.
Para var huzur var bir de üstüne bela arayışı var...
Is this a reupload of an old video?
It seems much more fun on a Soviet icebreaker!
This is episode 2 of 5.  Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb4cCdLiuSg Episode 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU23Oe912sM
Wouldn't recognise you without your hat 🤠😂
Nuclear I/B is better for journey. I recommend.
You know how its disrespectful to, i dont know, burn the american flag, so people shouldnt do it? Well Some folks find wearing a hat at a table disrespectful, nice how you show no concern over it though, hope you dont get upset when people do something you find disrespectful.
Why are people being forced to wear those USELESS face diapers????
Aww Kara. I love that you show your tears openly.
6:31  I like the comment about not wearing a hat properly, with the brim in the back.  Man, I am JEALOUS if they worst thing going on in your life is getting worked up about someone wearing a backwards hat.
❤❤❤
let me tell you something, Kara you are my hero because just imagine be in that cruise, I feel dizzy :(
dijon is the method of making it's not the place
I'll wear a hate if I fucking want to XD. It's kinda pathetic to harp on a guy for wearing a hat while eating.
How much did that trip cost?
What costs such a journey?
Do you really think the captain is navigating. It's the first, second and third mate.
The thing that Kara said about feeling connected to the people on the other ship, I kind of felt it too. Beautiful moment!
Why exactly do we need to go on cruises to the north pole and break a ton of ice on the way?
Y’all looks like the titanic love you guys🥴😝
Росатомфлот, это вам не Багдад, и не Кабул...
where is the naked woman from the thumbnail
Not knowing that Dijon mustard comes from Dijon is the best bit 🤦‍♂
Kara has such a tight body. Have you guys considered making adult content. Obviously not with Nate, but a model like Jason Luv from Blacked HD?
Traffic Jam at the North Pole - who'd have thought 🚢🚤
We're entuned into our phones, computers, and jobs. It hurts.
What an amazing journey this is.. looks awesome.
Sowas sollte verboten werden
this trip looks amazing
irony, of watching north pole melt live from a sauna
hay whats your 3 word loctation? ill meet you there
All that fuel pollution and ice destruction, sad
Wonder why glaciers breaking 🤔 😕 😢 🙄 😪 😑 🤔 😕
the guy at 5:47 is wonderful. look how he jumps into action! all for the cap.
These people must’ve never seen “Titanic”..
What does a cruise like this cost?
I clicked on this video after looking Video image 😂
bucket list
Thank you for destroying the environment. Cruise ships are bad, but a cruise ship on the north pol is just stupid.
it's crazy how white folks wear shoes in bed.
This is wonderful! Travel by the most questionable way. Why not travel the north pole every year, so you can compare the results of your pollution: each year more water, less ice.
arn't you lucky
I would love to go on this ship but the price is too high
Old people🤦🏿‍♂️
Cruise ships have often been described as ‘floating cities’, and as environmental groups have pointed out that they are just as if not more polluting. A passenger’s carbon footprint triples in size when taking a cruise and the emissions produced can contribute to serious health issues. On top of the pollution caused by their exhaust fumes, cruise ships have been caught discarding trash, fuel, and sewage directly into the ocean.
yeah !!! *u*k the climate !
NICE CRUISE!
How fun !
Fastest way to fuck the planet
and this video is exact my point why i refuse to take environment saving serious. some rich wankers go to do stupid stuff and brag about it. with money they get from poorer people via donations. and are proud of it. and then we found out global heating and shit happens and they dont get the conclusion to get a cruise to the polar with heated outside pools has something to do with it. while burning heavy oil ... so and then i should try to save the planet with not heating, bcs reasons ...
I was really like "oh i should do this" until i found out the tickets are $40,000
Wearing a hat backwards is really low class and shows that you lack any sense of style.
what are you doing here ? It's the last wild space in the world. Not a touristic destination. You just bring pollution in  a awesome wild natural space.. no intesrest...
going to the north pole and not one mention of santa claus??
Exercise is the perfect way to really enjoy food
I think it's disrespectful to use ur wife in a bikini to get YouTube videos. Your just sexifying her basically. That's wrong I wouldn't do that to my wife
Fun video! New subscriber✅ Y’all are very entertaining 🤠
Yall make this trip look so amazing! I was interested in the link you provided to book... $31K for 14 days. Well I guess I will just live this adventure through you two. 😭
Kara, there are no miles on the north pole!!  You are not in Alabama!!
This is contributing to climate change so much. It's disgusting. The fuel being burned puts soot on ice that collects more solar energy, melting it faster. The pleasure cruise through the ice is damaging the entire planet.
Very nice place.
feels soooo scripted and payed for.... sorry but it does
You guys should eat a steak and stop posting these wack wannabe videos. Grow up.
Not sure if its a good idea breaking ice all the way there, just for whims
this is awesome but I would be too afraid to go
Cool
Nothing like actually destroying the polar caps with a giant icebreaker for recreation and clicks...  🔥🌎 🤦‍♂ 🤮
7:52 If you're here because of the thumbnail, here you go
white teeth = yankees
Yea, lets burn a whole lot of fuel to watch the ice as long its still there!
why your teeth is so not natural ?
No swimming wear in the sauna. nude only. damn muricans
the tickets on the Russian ice breaker are 40 grand USD per person :D
Well, I'm assuming this isn't helping the depleting ice caps. Totally unnecessary and harmful trip
At the North pole all are friends. Wish it were that way everywhere.
I love the crew member sprinting to get the olive oil cap before Kara can. What a great crew team.
This is amazing!
It looks awesome, but man it is pricey :/ more than 66 000 euro for two, I'm the person that thinks how many things I could buy for that instead, like small flat in Poland or 4 new forklifts
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩❤️
Haha, who dafuq checks their email :D
Not everyone will be able to understand how important the moment of the meeting of the two ships was. I don't know when this episode was filmed, but the fact that ordinary people still treat each other like human beings and are happy to see each other touches my heart. I am from Russia and this is very important for me. Kara and Nate, thank you for being human
The way that guy ran for the cap at 5:46 was so funny 😂
Fore the censored part at 4:45  , she said “nate’s trying to run 5 miles” lol
I love that captains accent it was so fun to listen to haha
Titanic 2.0 anyone? No? Just me? K.
5:40 cheating on italy
Anyone who says literally will always be addicted to their phones.
*2 million views in 10 days ... I think you've now got it. The more blonde skin you show, the more views and more money starts to flow in.*
9:40 it's a TRAP!
They still do the mask charade? :D
New goal; Go To The North Pole!🐻‍❄️❄️ This series has been so fun! The way you two support each other brings me joy🤍
Fuck the planet right? Luxury vacation comes first!
What is this, you are not naked in the sauna, this is against the rules. You should get a towel and sit on a bench in the sauna and sweat naked!!!
The rock is from Durban ❤️❤️
36K per person on that cruise , yeah F that !!! Lol
I love this video but don't you feel like using an ice-breaker cruise is disturbing the north pole's ice floors? Not a climate activist, just wondering if I am thinking in the right direction
You spent $37,000 minimum each????? Good god lol
The food looks amazing.
Running on a treadmill on a cruise is really trippy. I can still feel it!
never seen a snow room like that... i wanna do this cruise now
What ship are you on?
This just feels like some prequel for ship horror movie.
2:40 good time to pause. You're welcome.
How much money was it?
I wish I could sell my privacy for money and become a vbloggar .
Thanks all these people for melting ice and destroy our planet. Sure your kids will appreciate
I could just watch the ice breaking it’s so relaxing ! Great series guys I am loving it, hopefully I can do this one day 😍
pretty boring video. 80% sitting in restaurant and eating. or telling about yourselves  "mini problems"  this is so unique trip! you can tell and show huge info about ship, share more sight scenes . but no! half of video is you are eating. but scenes with nature are great
I’m confused, so did you get invited for the cruise or did you plan to visit and researched between the two boats and decided this one?
Next time the Russian ship will torpedo the cruise ship. Why? Because they can.
Hi
I couldn't care less about the hat in the restaurant. But wearing clothes in the sauna? Now that is odd!
Hello, guys from the Russian nuclear icebreaker, I was there on July 12
Kara!! You got the best shoes.. ON
The nice thing about that trip is no chance of mosquito bites or malaria.
Shameless bikini thumbnail.
The door should have been designed to open towards the inside!
This looked so amazing wow
Rich & Spoiled.
What is the price of such cruise on that luxury ship?
40k cruise wow!
Just break all the ice and then cry about rising water levels. Such hypocrisy
They’re still wearing masks in the North Pole
Great for the environment!
Environment destroying
How neat is that?! Neature is pretty neat
what a horrible trip. everyone who supports these kind of trips doesnt care about pollution climate change.
you guys just destroy the nature the cruis ships is one of the most deadly environment killer which currently exists dont do this.
Looks lovely, but as a Finnish person I'm getting triggered by the sauna being cold :D if its actually hot you shouldn't be able to stand up while throwing water (="löyly").
OMG what a privilege passing by the '50 Let Pobedy' traveling to the North Pole
Guys, as someone who has followed your adventures from literally day 1, I can't express on how much you've widened my perspective on this great big blue marble we call Earth. From pushing ice chunks on a black sand beach in Iceland, to sleeping in a pod on the side of a cliff in South America, to your wonderful adventures on Mt Everest with the wacky charming Chucky Moon, you're both the vloggers that I admire and cherish. Always upbeat (though we all know that there are rough times too), and so cheerful.👍👍👍❤️🌈❤️🌈
People have fun like this until they  develop pneumonia. Then they stay warm.
Not pronounced soona..it’s a sauna. Look it up ffs
Havn't you seen Titanic 😂
That snow fight was one of the cutest things I have seen in a while.  And now I know how people disappear on cruise ships, they get blown off!
loss the hat ,if hat wear it fornt
You did not mention the name of the ship or the cruise company - WTF?
I love you guys and have been following your adventures (and shenanigan's) for years.  Keep up the fun!
This video made me want to go to Tennesse!! ;)
7:56 stop bs people, there's no steam :)
if i just had 100 grand laying around
wow I still remember their trip to the antartica 😂
How ironic, doing a luxury cruise to visit a place that gets destroyed by exactly this ignorance :D
Everybody still wearing their panic masks. Morons.
I really like your videos, but can you even go to sauna in the swimsuit? Most saunas i have been to, it is a huge no no.
looks like real fur on ur jackets...not cool bra
Some people be taking him wearing a hat to dinner way to seriously, like it ain't that deep.
I don't care about cell service at the N.Pole.. but I do wonder if anyone has ever died there ???  you could just 'jump ship' and be done in minutes.....
To be fair, we need solos of Nate in Speedos as a thumbnail for the thirsty ladies.   It's Kara AND Nate show.
you can call me karen all you want but don't come at me crying about not seeing polar bears when you're sitting on a ship that produces more co2 than over 12000 cars.
7:57
only £33.565 for this trip. thats some serious wonga!!
Auf anderer Leute Kosten Urlaub machen. Das sind mir die Richtigen....  Kümmert euch mal lieber um Nachwuchs statt die Zeit mit Influenzen totzuschlagen.
as a finn im annoyed about the sauna not being hot enough. the water at 8:12 should evaporate in under a second
Очень вежливые русские. Украинцы ценят отстраненность от Путлера ;)   .
Wow!! I will definitely be looking into this cruise! I’m not the biggest fan of cruises (just a floating hotel) but I love a good expedition. I’ve spent a decent amount of time in Alaska and fell in love with polar climates. Thanks for bringing us along!
Truly an amazing experience! You guys deserve it. I hope that one day I'll be able to board such a luxurious cruise ship. I would love to see polar bears in real life
That's not how you use a sauna. you're supposed to be sitting on the bench and throw the water (also be there for more than 15 minutes, this is coming from an Finnish person)
3:00 permission to dock
Bumped into your video for the very first time Kara and Nate. I thought I will be entertained for 22 long minutes and will virtually experience the cruiseliner but the video is all about you two and not the cruise. Sorry to say, I was disappointed.
I was brought up to take off my hat at the dinner table. Goes along with not speaking with your mouth full. But it's the backward hat that I can't get over, I think it's a dumb looking fashion. Even worse if the wearer also pairs it with sunglasses on a bright day.
Global warming is BS
You guys are the best! Love this episode so much!
I find these two insufferable
The way Nate was walking with the wind made me cackle🤣i love this series
42 knots = 48 mph
Take that flat earthers!
A sauna and a gym on a cruise ship next to all the melting ice? Wonderful touristic experience to see up close what YOUR trip is actually doing to the North Pole and the rest of our planet. I guess you don't want your kids to have a future.
How do you guys afford so manny trips together
Mit Maske ein no go 😭
Omg I’m laughing so much with Nate walking in the wind
Wow. I would have NEVER thought a cruise to the North Pole as an options. The cruise looks AWESOME, so long as the ship does not sink. MAY I ENQUIRE AS TO THE PRICE?  Your video is killing me with jealousy.
if someone fell over board, they would definitely die
got dang
When men never confront their own jealousy within, they attack other men socially. Then they call it “alpha”.  When many men possess this psychology, they feel comfortable and secure being violent bullies out in the open socially. They think they can get away with it.  When a lot of men all at once in abundance possess this psychology in agreement, then a religion is formed to make hatred look stronger socially than love.  Men use this psychology in the attempt to take away choice from women. They want to control what kinds of romantic decisions women are allowed to make, but without sharing honesty, humility, and respect first.  A male can never be honest and alpha simultaneously. “Dominating” and character development are always at odds with each other.  Human beings will always focus on the mind and attitude of a person, not the religion. If a mind is angry, conceited, and authoritarian, it is filled with lying and hatred.  Love and religion have never been synonymous. They have always been at odds. One is violent and authoritarian. The other is non-violence and free-thinking. It really is that simple.
My Wife and I have been huge fans of yours now for over 2-3 years but seeing  you both waving, saluting , hoping the best for the Russian Ice Breaker  "50 yrs of Victory" and smiling to them and yelling to them good luck. I mean how tone death are you both,  Russia Navy  is the one that runs that Ice Breaker and the Russian Military has killing hundred if not thousands of Ukrainian Children with their missiles. You both need to understand how the entire western world is against Russia and you supporting a ship that the Russian Navy supports is not a good look...
I think these people are rich enough to pay more in taxes.
Was blown away by the 40k rooms. Then saw all the 100k + rooms are already full. F'in rich people. Nothing left for the schmucks of the world to do but work
This looks like a fun trip but I could never do it bc I would get sea sick
Bait click! Hey it worked
Is it bad to break the ice up? Seems like it could melt the ice caps
Having just got back from my first cruise experience, this definitely made me want to try a cold cruise experience
no clothes in the sauna...that is not hygienic 😛
Any polar bear
Is this a national geographic cruise?
Love the snowball fight in the snow room . Y’all are so cute together 🥰
15:00 watching the ice go by... you guys were hauling ass!
48.3 mph wind
Are you the only people on this boat?
Nice
How does a ship like that, not have Starlink internet?
I love taking breaks from watching all your videos so I can binge them over a week! So if your videos drop in views and then shoot up. It's because of fans like me. Love you guys!
Looks like the Yatch map of Rainbow Six Siege.
What a life, using your wife as a clickbait poster. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I did the app rearranging thing but my brain got used to the new switch so fast it makes no difference 😭
Just had a question war all the meals included or no
I cannot watch this obvious destruction of beautiful nature.
Literally noone in the comments seems to care about them being on a fucking cruise ship heading the northpole while we are in the middle of a climate change crisis. And people love those 2 guys for the fancy expensive trip they make?   wtf is this
Some people in norway be like a its so hot and some people from usa and hot plasses be like ahhh its so fricking cold
40k each... FML
Thanks for sharing your amazing experiences! Kudos for NOT having tattoos.
Hahaha KARA!! You sound exactly like me on a cruise ship. I literally workout every single day on there JUST to work up my appetite so I can eat as much as I can. Ludvig does a lot of heavy weight lifting while I do a lot of HIIT or running coz that seems to make us hungriest. Totally with ya!
Madam ne gut !!!
Kara & Nate: lets go on a cruise Everyone: where? how? Kata & Nate: The cruiseship is an icebreaker, the captain is french and it sails to the north pole while eating French-style haute cuisine
I AM SO HAPPY! 🥰<--- this saying I picked from you, Kara! The weird thing is I only say it when I watch your adventures. It makes me really, really happy! *Thank you, the Internet and Youtube, and all the wonderful people behind those inventions for making it possible for almost every person in the world to travel to places they might never see.*☺I am so happy.
This is me not knowing any better, but isn't that boat going through the ice where animals live kind of like a bulldozer going through a forest?
Must be nice
9:07 never heard Nate laugh like that 🤣🤣
How many people are on the cruise with you guys?
It drives me nuts how people pronounce sauna!!!😣
I’ve always wanted to ask if Kara is a former gymnast? I get that hint from the backflips in tuck position off of a boat.
It's not that you wore a hat in the restaurant but that you wore it BACKWARDS!
Santa? Where rrrrr uuuuu? Saaaantaaaa?!
10c is not that cold!
Magnetic North Pole is apparently where you guys went; geographic North Pole is where Santa lives.
The Rock is from California, born in 1972...May he's a Taurus :)
Santa?
Anybody else watch this just to see Kara? …asking for a friend.
“I have no clue what that means…. but it’s FAST 😳”
I doubt you have actually been to the north pole. maybe a pole in the ground! lol sorry
this is only possible because we're melting all the ice, soon there won't be any ice left and the planet will be flooded
That bed looks so comfy. I'd be napping all the time.
I'm eating right now Kara.
This channel honestly keeps me sane. Remembering that there is so much more than what's just in my head. Love you guys
Hey, finally stiff.
Ok, this ship looks like an absolute DREAM! How amazing to be on this in such a remote corner of our planet!
The damage you do to the environment with such a trip is enormous. Please reconsider such a lifestyle. Your children will appreciate it.
I would wear a front facing hat eating in a restaurant
You guys! You r videos are so freakishly entertaining that I NEVER look at my phone while watching them.  Thanks for taking us along and making such a high quality material.
are yall Swedish or something?
How much for two?
I would love to see the CO2 carbone bilan of this trip AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Wow, I couldn’t imagine being on a cruise ship that empty. We went on the new, Carnival- Mardi Gras Cruise, earlier this year to the Bahamas and a couple other stops.  That ship was so packed with people. It was a good time, but I think I’d prefer to just relax and do, a whole lot of absolutely NOTHING on this cruise!  Plus, my hot flashes won’t stand a chance in the North Pole. :)  Then again, the North Pole might not stand a chance against my HOT FLASHES! .. LoL 🥵
Can you tell me how much this pleasure cost? Just for science :D
Is anyone else on the ship looks like you and the crew?
That view of you both at the table was an interesting sight because you're mostly only watching Kara eat. When the camera tipped I just thought to myself, "well, that was the extent of Kara and Nate both in view at the table," LOL. I LOVE your guys videos. I love following all of your adventures. I hope I win the trip to meet you in Nashville but even if I don't just the idea of meeting you guys was exciting lol. You are just so awesome. I'm working hard at what I do so I can book trips like this.
Waw a Ponant Croisière is one of the best goals a human can have. Congrats.
I'm so lost how many people apparently live their lives through this couple.   And then the couple itself is filming everything all the time. How do you enjoi anything if its always just for the others?  This has to be exhausting as hell
Masks suck
Is all the food and like drinks free? And how expensive is the ticket per person
Kara, this is also why I got rid of my smartphone. I am ALWAYS unplugged. It's freeing.
GOOD for you guys, FINALLY relaxing!! You don't do that enough!
“NAYCHrrr” 😂😂😂
Ronaldo?
Cruise ships burn a lot of fossil fuel and making a cruise trip to watch polar bears and melting ice bergs is ethically dubious. I do like your other videos though.
But didn’t u go to Antarctica 🇦🇶?
first time i see one of your video, already felt in love! :) you both are great! may i ask you what is your equipment  to record those beautiful videos? i saw a gopro  but not a lot more :) thx a lot
Just imagine the fuel consumption of one of these ships, and the fumes that they're belching out right into that pristine Arctic ecosystem so that you can live in absolute luxury in one of the Earth's most hostile environments. And some other poor sod worrying about getting an electric car. What a time to be alive!
wonder why there arent cruises to Antarctica
Otra forma de que el propio polo norte desaparezca: ir allí en un crucero en plan "aventura", que pena, de verdad.
The only part i took from this is rearranging my apps because i hate that i use my phone a lot, but in turn i do use it mostly for informative things
iNTRESTING TRIP, TO BAD YOU NEARLY ALWAYS SHOW YOURSELF AND TRY TO BE FUNNY ON THE VIDEO. MAKES IT DULL.
Hi
The Rock is from Hawaii and I sure don't know the answer to the other question lol
Hi Guys Looks Great!!! How do I find out HOW MUCH, and can you tell me what type of rocks they are in the Suana Please?
Yes, let's go and pollute the pole DIRECTLY, because everyone knows that Arctic ice needs more diesel soot thrown onto it... 🤬  "Still no polar bears" she says. Yeah, wonder why that is, uh?! Let's encourage the stupid cruise industry a lot more and see if there will be more of them in a decade, okay? 🙄People are so stupid that we earned what's now happening on this planet.
OMG.........Officially my NEW DREAM.....How much is that Cruise going for??
almost $40k a ticket
Anybody that wears a mask I will not watch . you are a fool
I have 80 mph wind before at my house I went outside to hold the tree up and I was holding on to the door handle and my body lifted up thankfully I was holding on but it was very scary
My daughter is yalls biggest fan lol she always says they don't live far from us I want to meet them lol
What cruise company did you use?
nice destruction of nature. thank for the co2
The look on Nate's face as he saw the camera begin to fall was marvelous.  Seeing the Russian Icebreaker was marvelous also.  What an amazing trip.
I wonder if they were able to use the drone, while they were on the ship.
when the camera feel, i thought nat was acting like he was gonna turn it off to scold u for not working out.
Interesting choice of thumbnail.
say hi to santa!!
It's 2022. Wear a hat wherever you like.  All these "manners" people can stay at home if they don't like it.
I don’t know how 1.5 million people can listen to this girl talk…..🤮 “like omg basically” I would throw her off the side. American women 🤢
Y’all are so full of it
What the name of the ship, you’re guy’s talk to fast to really get of sense of what you’re want the view to really enjoy your video🤷‍♀️
Were there kids on the cruise? Would love to bring them.
maybe this why ice bergs are breaking apart lol
How much carbon did you emit on your North Pole adventure? It’s a little bit sick, here we are in Europe facing a 10x increase in energy cost, the worst drought in 500 years and you guys are in a sauna at the North Pole.  I mean I don’t want to be Dr. Doom but it is slightly pathetic. I have two kids, I know that they will have it tougher than me. Maybe as you have no kids you can somehow morally convince yourself it’s all just fun!
One really nice cruise ship, great video. Thanks for sharing.
How could u upload it with no internet? Or did u get back vary quickly? Amazing footage btw
Damn this cruise is near $50,000 USD per person that shits wild.. I wish
wear a hat wherever the hell you want this isnt 1865
YOU GUYS ARE LIVING MY TRAVELLING DREAM 24/7 😭😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍
Titanic still wondering how the heck that ship can sale thru icebergs without sinking
We push and push into the last untouched corners of the wild to get some new experience of luxury service.  These people are the logical endpoint of humanity..
Anyone else hoping for kara’s OF link drops?
NEATURE IS NEAT!!!!
Not going to lie ... all I would be able to think of is the Titanic sinking. Apparently I have a fear of big ships in the icy waters and I didn't even realize it until you started showing the footage of the water and ice breaking. I'd  also probably be to scared to go on the deck 😆  Beautiful cruise but I'm to anxious to handle it
The food looks so dam good that buffet  food looks amazing
Sauna at the north pole - perfect idea :) Thanks for great video.
that wind sounded haunted😂
I don't get why people are so offended by you wearing a hat. I wear a backwards cap always when I go out somewhere because I don't feel comfortable without one, even when I go out to dinner. I say do whatever makes you comfortable!
fuck me 33 and never tried Dijon mustard..
How do you post videos on the ship?
Try this on for a moment.. 30 days sitting under water on the bottom near the north pole. No one knows where you are.. not even the navy that gave you the sub you are in.. LOL
Nautical milrs vs statute mile; 1 Nautical mile= 1.15 statute mile. So Knots are basically 1 Nautical mile per hour.  1 kn=1.15 mph.
this can be you for only 30 k  pp   have fun
Wow...what a great adventure.. was wondering if the meals they served on board is Halal Muslim friendly or not.?
just take your hat off????????????????  WTF
how much did this cruise cost?
I'm honestly surprised that this day and age that there are people who still care about people wearing hats indoors. It has always seemed without a clear line of logic and arbitrary.
I was on an aircraft carrier for months at a time out to sea I think I had my fill of  ships, But hey have a good time
What a great video! I loved this, and can't wait for the other parts 🤩 one notion though, it doesn't get dark during summertime, in winter it doesn't get light at all, polar night.
I’m going up to the front of the ship. I see you are up to speed with ship nautical terms.
I think you two live the best lives 🤩
Fancy having a holiday and wearing a surgical mask all day.  Stuck onboard that can with these covidiots, all jabbed up supercilious drones
LOVE your videos!   Thank you so much for providing me with so many hours of entertainment and adventure!  💕
do I see correct that it costs 32k USD per person? *cries in poor*
The only thing good about this video it the chick spreading her legs and the bikini scene
I like ur daily routine in the ship..please continue to update..
AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!!!!! There is not much more to say!!!!!! Thanks for leaving the links to the companies cause North Pole is on my bucket list!!!! 😁😁😁😁
people that wear masks are zomies.
A wonderful vlog, thank you! 🤗 BUT!! Visiting a sauna in bathing clothes?! One doesn‘t do that!
I’m really curious… do you have internet on this cruise?
The Rock is from Samoa 🇼🇸 he’s my cousin
They’re from Nashville! Happy to find their channel! Please do a meet and greet in Nash.
Wow so brave
Cruises are killing our planet, but you don't care
I saw so many Indonesians on the cruise!
Always love your videos!! What a COOL experience 😍
It is funny that they called a big chunk of ice a continent.
I feel like you guys live in a rush for live everything in a full excitement mode. When reality is just not like that at all. Recording everything (of course) for the revenues (which are definitely needed when you’re an independent creator in YouTube).   What I would propose to you guys is to find new investment options. So you can be more loose, with more time free. To be less anxious, or at least not to see like that. Rather than enjoying your vlogs lately, it feels like a rush (as I said before) of excitement when at some point it just feels fake.   I have already done investments myself and I’m more loose. You guys should find your own options. Hope and wish the best for you both. You guys deserve what you’re living. Hopefully you’ll enjoy the things you’ll definitely enjoy at the moment. Chill more and leave those cameras and equipments aside sometimes.
You were thinking about going to Russia and going on a russian cruise ship. You should of been giving that ship the bird not waving at it.
Yep, before having access to the internet on a smartphone, you had to like bring books and magazines and other things to pass the time when going to doctor's offices, etc.
This is insufferable
The fact that it’s summer😂
That was a fun video! Thanks Nate and Kara!
My dad loved the Arctic (told me it was the most beautiful place on all the Earth) and I wish I could make this same trip with him but he passed in 2003, however I think he would have been so mad to see the Russian ship. He did many missions in the RCAF and Canadian Forces in the Arctic claiming the North Pole for Canada.
Long live Ukraine! 🇺🇦
Thanks for the video, now I know this will never be a cruise that I care to do.
Love it
Me: Walk against the wind and that is my exercise for the day.   I lived in the high arctic for a year and that was enough for me. I was at 60⁰ North of the Arctic Circle. A cruise like that could change my mind though. I would nope out of the polar dip though. I live in a generally temperate part of Atlantic Canada. We rarely even have snow for Christmas. I like it that way.   I can handle the cold because, I am Canadian after all, but I have small caperilleries and when the cold makes them constrict, it is quite painful as my circulation gets cut off to the affected areas. It is called Raynaud's Syndrome.  I frequently change my apps around. I don't do it on purpose though. I do it when I am sleepy and then have to look for them lol.
I’m TOTALLY adding this trip to my bucket list. 👏🏻❤️
Kara they other people on the other ship where saying bonne voyage which have a good trip
What is your mic set up? It sounds great even when you are on the deck which is obviously super windy.
❤️❤️❤️
Never mind found it 🙂
Yeah that "50 let pobedy" ship is old but sturdy , I didn't know they launched a new cruise ship to the north pole, definitely an improvement over the older ship. Great video, well done.
Can I get the info on that cruise I’m really interested ?
How much does the cruise cost ?
I think I’d lose my mind with the maskretarfation I am seeing in this video.
Looks so much fun of the day ...that was so great day 😊
You guys are awesome! I love the adventures, despite them making me jealous. :) FYI,  at above 45 kts of wind on a US aircraft carrier only essential personnel are allowed out on deck - that wind is no joke! and it being so cold!? Nate you're a champ. Kara, I'd sit inside with you.
Looks like a cool trip.  Too bad the destination is literally pointless.  This would be more about the journey for me.  And at least now you have an argument against flat earthers.  I'd probably have sat internet I cant be without I work and run a business online.  I grew up in the 70's and 80's and we didn't have google of course we were just dumb and accepted it. :P
I was giggling right along with Kara and Nate. Thanks for all you do to show us the many ways to interact with the world, to travel, to enjoy life
That russian ship is government owned. While the war in Ukraine is ongoing it is immoral and tone deaf to show them on your channel, thus promoting them, consider them for travelling and casually with a smile on your face wave at that ship (and people travelling there who basically gave money to continue war ), and scream “bonjour”
Still wondering what kind of man Nate is always using his wife's half naked body as click bate. Smh
I wish to travel there one day
beautiful footage for nice travel.enjoy it. but why are you obsessed with getting fat. it is so strange to see you obsessing about food and exercise and goal setting all for not getting fat. were you so conditioned by your education? so narrow....
"Is the North Pole melting?!" "Yes." "What should we do about it?" "Well... CRUISES to pump more CO2 into the atmosphere of course!"
I love cruising but THIS IS MY TYPE OF CRUISING EXPERIENCE!!! I am so impressed.
Steph Rocks!!!!!
Anyone know what brand that black sweatshirt Nate is wearing is?
Kara, I work out to eat and eat to work out. I feel you 100%!
So you're going back to the Caribbean after this trip, right?!
super cool and trip of a lifetime, but damn almost 40k per person is a bit much for me
Destroying the earth, one cruise at a time..
I’m so incredibly jealous. This looks incredible
It’s ok to pig out...your body needs more calories in extreme cold...your body burns it faster.
Why are your ankles not covered? You are at the north pole. That doens't make sense at all.
Did you see any night walkers?
Kate: Merrrrciiiii! Chef: you're welcome
Kind request, guys. Next time you consider or even mention ʳussia, please take the following actions: 1) mention that russiaisaterroriststate ; 2) donate few dollar to United24, Prytulafoundation, ComeBackAlive or any other fund that supports Ukraine. Thank you in advance.
russiaisaterroriststate
the rock is from samoa
32k for the cruise on a nuclear powered ice breaker. Super cool but way out of my price range.
Kara, to satisfy your curiosity about the 2 North Poles, of course, geographic is where you're headed, and at present magnetic (which is always moving) is presently just east of the International Date Line north of Russia. Although I don't speak but a few words of Russian (I can count to 10, and be polite), I can read it; the ship's name is Rosatomflot, and the only part google translate could translate was 'flot', which is 'fleet', as in the Russian airline, Aeroflot.
Goodlord the comments on the hate at the table were ridiculous. Worry about what you're wearing to the table and let Nate worry about himself. Kara is a big girl if she is bothered she will say something.
Girl in a bikini on the thumbnail - more than one million views! You´ve done it!
Who is your cameraman is
Trying to imagine the carbon offset costs. . .
Rich people doing rich people things, NICE POG.
$48,000 for the budget trip, $57,000 for the luxury trip.
The cruise starts at 47,000k
Just curious: How much was all of this?
he is just in the nederland wit that wind
Absolutely fabulous. I am exploring going on this cruise. When you guys retire from travelling the world please get a farm and do gardening chickens and life . Then do home stays xxxx
so this is why huge ass icebergs keep breaking off
@19:16 nate sounds just like Michael Scott lmao
I wouldn’t greet the ruzzian ship so cheerfully in today’s circumstances. ruzzia is a terrorist state, it started the war in Ukraine and the war is still here. Just a reminder.
If you play violin well enough you can get to the North pole :)
can't wait to know the daily life of all the nature and diversity spoiled by this kind of selfish endeavor to "live" but of course only in first class. In a context of global warming et mass extinction this kind of beaviour is really "out of this world"
You two are such a beautiful couple
If its unlimited devices can't we all just get your password and use your access?  lol
What song is being played at 13:45?
Kara is hella annoying.  Leave her at the North Pole 😂😂😂
Kara, aren’t you cold wearing a strappy dress to dinner?  (You look great, as always, just wondering:))
What shoes does Nate have on at 10:50 those are clean!
Love all your episodes. Great quality videos. What camera do you currently use?
Congrats to be the first person I come across on the toilet 😂😂
Damn Nate is lucky.   Kara in the spa....damn
🤔🤔 hotel California by violin.......so French
So y’all think those 2 ships were the only 2 up there your forgetting about the 2 or 3 nuclear subs that are below the ice from the USA alone.
definitely isn't a carnivore cruise...love this type of travel
Throws up Ukraine flag
I think these 2 are getting a bit too expensive for my taste. This trip is about $30k per person not really backpacking and showing us what we can do on a budget.
The snowball fight had me cracking up! Love you guys!
Kara has the worst skin I've ever seen. Instead of 'detoxing' on juice, how about drinking water sometime?
you two are nuts love watching your vides it looks like you enjoy yourselveswith  with all of your adventures
My favorite of your videos so far!!
Whats up with the masks
The food looks incredible. It's about flavor and textures, not filling you up with calories. The boat and your destination are incredible. Another incredible trip I get to live thru you two. Much appreciated.
The magnetic North Pole is on the move......it's is halfway down in the middle of Siberia.
So embarrassing a 33 year old man wearing a hat BACKWARDS to dinner
Is this video about a trip to the North Pole or about close ups of this woman's face and body?
O honey look at all the beautiful nature we're polluting so nice to see it before it's gone
what an intresting hair due
Just wondering, do they require that you wear a mask sometimes?
THIS IS CLEARLY A FRENCH SHIP  hahahhaha cocorico accent right there
watching glaciers collapse is a travesty we shouldn't be seeing, if we want this world to continue. you're not seeing polar bears cuz there's no food for them anymore.  cruising is one of the worst ecological ways to see the earth; and yet - i'm here, watching this, cuz i myself won't go. i am, ipso facto, also part of the problem, and i know this. but having a gym and hot tubs on an already environment crushing situation - SUPREME LUXURIES - so i had to say something.   onto being a glutton thru osmosis. ty for listening to my ted talk
Was liking video until you supported the Russians why don’t you start a “I kill babies channel “ wake up dumb fs
How much it costs?
You guys are awesome! Please don’t stop making videos
Where's the lobster and king crab legs?
Stopped watching this channel cuz Kara is almost half naked in every video 😂 getting ridiculous
Nate Keep wearing hats on dinner tables, it looks good. Btw great series about the North Pole. We hope to go one day, thanks for inspiring!
sssuuurrrreeeeeeeee
Absolutely brilliant video, Thank you. Hugs UK
this is first video i have watched from yr channel. very cringey ....peace out
You guys make this look like SO MUCH FUN! I actually would really like this. Maybe it should go on my bucket list. Also, you guys should include the menus or a description of what you are eating. I would love to know! Everything looked delicious. 😋🥰
Hold on! You are so happy to see Russian ice breaker? Are you living in this world? Only right solution is to show middle finger for them. Wake up!
Absolutely the most annoying duo on YouTube.   Utmost respect for what you have achieved mind.
🙌🥳
classy, nice and elegant
I cant find your ship on the booking Website can you help?
What an adventure!
These cruises are like $50K 🤯
The hat off crew are usually the same people who would save an animal before an actual human being. Superstition. Same people who tell you ban the headscarf calling others snowflakes but are the biggest cry babies but here they are trying to enforce 'code of dress'.

it's bloody cold up north you will have to eat like a horse to gain weight
You have had a lot of amazing moments over the years but the ending of this video has to be the best! That was a shocker and amazing!
The spa is incredible and the snow fight had me laughing!! I cannot believe that wind💨 so glad y’all didn’t get blown away!! I was curious if there was many other people on the ship with y’all and I was able to see some throughout the video..... nice
, but this is my favorite series from y’all.  Totally loving it!
42 kts of wind is actually really fast, there are funny videos of small light planes flying against that kind of strong wind and it looks like they are floating in mid air because the engine cant over power it.
No need to be rude and delete a simple question guys....you could even acknowledge it privately if you don't want what I said seen
You came here for 7:54
Hi Kara and Nate!!  I just found your Vlogs now 6 years after you started and I have been binge watching you constantly!!  I’m finally after about a week and a half to Vlog 279 I think, the one where you are in Argentina and telling your story about how you became YouTube Vloggers.  It really touched my heart how sweet you two are and now I try to keep up with your current Vlogs as well as going in order from the beginning.  I truly enjoy watching and I moved from Wisconsin to a city in Colorado that you stayed at an RV park once…Montrose Colorado!!!  And I just want to say if you’re ever back this way I would absolutely just die to have an adventure with you two.  I can’t wait to see more adventures as I continue binging.  You guys are really down to earth, so sweet and have so much fun.  Love you guys!!!!!!
Just personal opinion, I think it's very weird how so many people commented abt Nate wearing the hat backwards like chill down
❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍🙌🙌🙌
$15k PER PERSON!!!  That is an experience for the %1.  I hope to join all you done people one day
I’m the new subscriber :) Love all of your travel vlogs!
Of course u won’t see polar bears ur destroying there home
so its climate change thats causing the ice caps to melt , or idiots like you on holiday breaking the ice caps for no reason other than the bragging rights to say  i've been to the North Pole. 😪
Keep wearing hats wherever you wanna wear hats! 😂
Omg at 5:46 it was so cute when the waitress ran to get the lid on the floor
I really enjoyed this video. You two are wonderful.
Great video, but how older is your gf than you??? It looks like 15 years...
Let's burn some carbon. Wait, let's burn some filthy bunker oil carbon while we go exploit the last of what we are destroying.
I’m here for Kara’s North Pole. if you know what im sayin 😂
I dont mean to be negative but humans really can't leave natural wild world alone,look now they are in ice poles desturbing seals and defrosting ice with their machines!That will affect wild life there for fact!We just cant let these natural places be!
Oh christ on a bike... so you're on holiday.  Good for you.
It would be worth every penny to sit in that steam room!!
It's a little known fact that the mustard seed for most French mustard comes from Canada - Cliff Claven.
🤔 I Wonder how long people are able to cruise around on those ships ( polluting the air)….. breaking through ice ( as long as there is ice)….looking for Polar bears( as long as there are some…..) 🤷🏻‍♀️
Next time the wind is that strong jump
The orange an yellow coats or how you name it, you get it from the ship or did you buy it yourself?
https://youtu.be/58mr5raL-NEhttps://youtu.be/58mr5
Start of the Video me thinking wow I wish I could weigh what Nate weighs, watching those winds happier I way what i do haha, Great video Guys.
yall taking an arctic cruise and I need to use goddamn paper straw
Kara, you look amazing.  Jeesh, hubba hubba.
Have you ever made a video of your shooting “process”….that is, how your every move is sort of thought out with regards to filming….and then how Kara edits it all.     Thanks for this trip!   Wish I could do this one day.
nice carbon footprint
What does this cruise cost?
The captain's huge and very French sigh ❤️❤️
Is it possible to take a  vtol and land onto the landing platform of this ship to take part for a couple of days or something like that? Seems like a really cool business retreat for a couple of days. Would get a lot of work done in an environment like that if I went alone 🤔
seeing that russia cutter was so awesome.  thats my fav part so far.  that would have been so exciting.  you two are very lucky.  living the life thats for sure
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So amazing. Thank you
North Pole cruises are the dumbest thing you can do, you literally drive through the part you’re melting w/ your ship right now 🤦🏼‍♂️
you guys are funny...love it. Stay safe
imagine you are sitting naked in the sauna you turn around and 50 russians are waving at you from the other ship !!🤣
K you are an addict. N you are a true sunshine boy. That wind was not even bad.
Oh wow. That’s so cool!
Wooooow that’s so awesome u we’re choosing between Russian and American icebreaker. That’s so thoughtful. And u were soooo happy when u saw it. It’s definitely the best thing ever.   And just so u know that icebreaker belongs to the government of that terrorist country. And with every penny they make they are torturing and killing Ukrainians. But yeah sure why not to be so happy bout it. It’s not u guys right?  I’ll never believe u didn’t know about that so don’t try to convince me otherwise. Sure u can delete the comment if u got nothing to say. But actually u know it’s such a disrespect for all people of Ukraine. It’s disgusting
I LOVE THESE EPISODES!!! Thank you for sharing your adventures!! I'm sure I will never see this in my lifetime especially at $41,000.00 per person lol... but I love watching you guys!!
I wonder how coincidental that meeting was, seeing they would probably plan their voyages along the same routes especially when going to the north pole, one reason being for safety if one ship were to have an incident/emergency. They were probably looking at each other on radar for days planning to meet up along the route :) just my thoughts, but im no seafarer. Could also be that they dont talk to each other at all, but I find it unlikely. Some countries are setting up rules fr ships that travel into remote areas, making them travel in "pairs" in case one has an emergency, so that there is a ship close by
Great for making babies 👍 North Pole 👶
What time do they use near the north pole, do they use French time or is there a special time?
🌨☃🚢🐻‍❄🐧🦭🐋🐳❤
I have been looking at these cruises for so long now, definitely is a goal of mine to go on! Looks amazing!
It is so cool to see people enjoing the food because i am the noe in charge of suppling the ship with goods on Svalbard☺️ Nice to see the other side of traveling to the north pole
be so careful that the wind doesn't blow you off and over the boat. That could happen if it's that strong and that would be the end and so awful. BE CAREFUL! funny people bother you about your hat!
Russians always goes Nuclear lol
3:13 I taped a 20 minute workout on my machine, and played it back at high speed so it only took 10 minutes. I got a great workout...lol
Love the jackets where did yall get them from ?
It’s like you are on a spaceship.
I dream to met your guys in person because I love to travel
*goes to snow room to relax*  *has snow fight*  LOVE THE ENERGY
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This video is SO chaotic — never seen Kara and Nate quite like this and I LOVE it! 😍  Love seeing you two some how open up more and more and more, and continuously grow. Such beautiful humans.  Love you guys. 💖💖
What a wild wonderful beautiful luxurious adventure!  Kudos.
The people from the other boat were saying bon voyage, which means they were saying have a nice trip (voyage = travel) and bon being good or nice) ! Love your videos by the way !
Waiting on the third installment……😅
BOOZE..... that is the BAD HABIT... Not a good example for kids watching
Them seeing the other boat was so cute
That was so cute in the snow room 😩
The dessert for lunch looked incredible
You can see the progression as the ice gets thicker and they get closer to the North Pole when they film the ocean during the transitions
Omg the snow fight!! I love you guys.. you are both so awesome 😄😄
The Rock was born:  Hayward , California
You asked where is the Rock from he's from Hawaii. I think?
watching you guys videos makes me feel so wholesome. I love you guys and enjoy your trip!!!
Anyone else casually eating a can of fruit?
show us some bush
Ya
Why are you only sometimes wearing one of those useless masks? Yes…hats indoors and especially in restaurants are considered rude.
Love you too yoots
You don’t have to give us your weight at the end of the trip, or justify your eating choices. In fact, it’s probably better that you don’t, as you have folks in the audience who are dealing with EDs already, and that restrictive talk is pretty triggering. Thanks!
the mindless socials thing is real. When it started annoying me was when I just deleted all my socials. Doesn't work for everybody -- especially folks who make a living through social -- but it was really good for me.
Question: how do you two afford all that you do? I imagine is get a chunk from YouTube but we’re also do you get it?
You look like you had the ship to yourselves!?
The Rock is from Cali.
I wish they would use wireless mics it's hard to hear them
First time comment. My husband and I watch every video for the last 2 years.  I was curious if your fitness plan kara, I noticed you were going to do a video with Nate’s fitness but I’d like to hear your fitness plan as well.
I swear it’s like tradition for them to bang their first nights on a cruise 😂
03:04 yes i can relate to you kara  but the point is i only eat  i don't workout i'm fat😝
How can this cruise even take place. I thought Global Warning destroyed all the ice and glaciers. I don't believe it, I think this was made in Hollywood.
How dare you make me wait for the next episode.  I love your content. You both are awesome.  Thank you for what you do!!
By the way, that Ship seems so cool (no pun intended)!?
Why does it matter if u wear a hat ? It's just a random rule that humans made up because they felt offended. Who cares? There is no purpose to that rule besides people just nit liking it .
The difference between the geographic and magnetic north pole is: Geographic goes off by latitude and magnetic goes off by the earths natural magnets. The reason why their is a difference is the earth magnets always moves so south and north always change.
If there's only water at the North Pole, what about Santa?
I am 12 years old and I love your videos!! I wish I could meet you guys!! y'all are so cool!!
Gotta love how her leggings become see-through as she stretchs 👌
If I wasn't addicted to my phone, I wouldn't be watching this.
wear ur hat don't listen to the goobers
Kara and Nate..  did you experience sea sick?
Neature Walk!
just wondering how you did a google search about the Nt, pole with no internett
How many other people were on the ship with you guys? Everything always looks so empty! And how many can the boat hold?
Kara keeping it real with talking about going off the grid! Thanks for sharing that experience 😊 and this whole experience in general!!
guys, you missed an opportunity here, to talk about SANTA! haha
Can we have your flexibility workout routine? I can barely touch my toes haha :D
It’s so wonderful to see the joy between the two ships. There’s so much more that connects us, than divides us
I have followed your journey from the beginning and the adventures just keep getting better and better! You are such an inspiration that this old lady learned how to edit and started my own travel channel = Amazing Places with Amy
We’ve looked up stuff in the encyclopedias in cruise ship libraries! I mean they prob don’t have anything about The Rock. But I’m sure you could read up on the North Pole! 🤣
The hat thing is a question of respect to the people serving you, fellow guests and the crew in general--I am guessing that you have not paid a cent for this trip so perhaps a modicome of respect should be shown to your benefactors.
When I saw that Russian ice breaker.. I felt the human connection, which is so rare these days. Faith in Humanity restored!
I think this is my favourite video of you guys🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Very beautiful! We won't miss the episide 3! :)
HOW DOES NATE NOT WEAR LONG SOCKS OUTSIDE 🤯🥶
She called him Noah when they were throwing snow
#StandWithUkraine You've got a dislike from me for waving at the ship of the terrorist's country. It's a great video, a great trip, and you're both great. But think twice about what you are doing and try to better understand the world in which you live. I don't think your ancestors would have waved and smiled at a German ship during World War II.
Congrats I voted for you guys on the Travel Influencer of the year
Cruise ships 2022.. humans ain't learning...
Just imagine that 30 years ago, breaking this ice would have been an absolute challenge even with the most modern ice breaker. In summer, not on about winter. It tooks us less than 30 years to turn that into an easy job for a simple ice breaker.
I love how much camaraderie the 2 ships had! Just goes to show you. The human experience supercedes war and at the end of the day people are much more alike than we know..our leaders can fight all day long but we can always be together no matter what they do or say.
ONLY costs 31k per person :P
Sorry, but cruise ships are just incredibly harmful to the environment...
Is this a $20K+ trip?!? Per person?!?  Looks amazing though.
New read for the internet section: The Shallows | what the internet is doing to our brains By Nicholas Carr  I read it in high school. Used the book for references in college. And apply it as a new mom. It’s a great and easy read!
hahaha i switched the app around ones did that all the time love you guys keep up the good work❤❤
When are the kids coming
When is the kids coming
😂😂😂in the cooling off room i thought when kara tried to open the door it didn’t budge ( 😱 i thought the door had frozen )  Looks an absolutely stunning Ship ) aww Nice to see the other ship going back, does give goosebumps to think indeed  Only 2 ships go that way .  Looking forward to to your adventure when do Reach the North pole . But what an Experience ,something you will for sure Treasure for ever looking back at your photos / films at some point over the years 🥰.  Take care 🥰🥰
Hello there! I love seeing all your challenges - well done for everything you have accomplished so far ! I have not yet watched ALL your videos, but wondering if you ever thought about walking the “Camino Del Rey”….
Woah, starting at 41k. Once in a lifetime for sure but that’s a down payment on a house.
Would have loved to see them bust out a Ukrainian Flag when the Russian ship passed.
About the app addiction, I have the same problem, so I delete Instagram sometimes, so I don't waste hours on watching reels. This time I need it to be in contact with people. I tried using the meta business suite, but it's hard since you don't get emails when you actually get a message about something.
6:07 so you have travelled to >100 countries and you didnt know Dijon mustard comes from Dijon, France? Sheesh...maybe better to slow down and explore each country properly
tomorrow is hopefully a new vid i am so excited!! when i grow up i also want to travel throught the world when im an adult. u guys are doing such a great job with the vids and they are cool. i hope u upload more, but i know how hard the editing is.
I love this, but random (possibly stupid) question... how come you guys aren't taking drone shots?
kara: there are the french fries. in my mind: oooo french fries besties. ye
Saying this again and not sure Kara and Nate will ever see it but as influencers it would be great of you could promote actually good things for once: sustainable travel for example and not the largest carbon polluter on Earth: a cruise ship, and not any cruise ship but a luxury cruise ship POLLUTING THE ARCTIC! Especially as you guys have a majority American audience…you said you went plant based for this reason…you just look like hypocrites.
What's with the hat criticism? Wear a beanie instead? Ladies tie their messy hair, guys wear cap.
Hey! I just wanted to say that it was so so cool to see Kara and Bec in Kingston a few days ago, you guys were so kind and I just wanted to say thanks for posting these awesome videos for us. 💕💕
He's from California
F*ck that russian boat, they started war in Ukraine. Their ships have to banned.
Hello Kara an Nate l just saw you guys up on the big screen on-board Symphony of the Seas
You should have yelled 'you are terorists!!!' to that russian ship and thair passangers. Because these people supporting their government of killing children and civiliance in Ukraine! Love you guys anyway
The wind is fast as hell, Kara just standing near the window and the wind just saying to let it in😂😂😂
It looks like such an awesome trip. I always like disconnecting from the internet on trips/vacations. You really get to appreciate the simple things and your surroundings a lot more.
Kara is me.  Love it.  Eating and having fun.
Kara has such a magnetic personality, she just draws everybody in💞 And our Nate...🙈Distinguished gentleman🙂💖
my irl name is nathan
It seems like you're on the ship by yourselves. Looks like an amazing cruise. Wish I could afford to do something like this.
Jesus Christ is god
Thank you from nz for weighing in kilos lol
Love it 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Cruise ships are literally the worst pollution emitters, glad you saw the north pole one last time before it melts
"And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works.  Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone NOT FOUND written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire." (REVELATION 20:12-15 NKJV)   Today, while you are still alive and able, may you repent from your sins, believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that JESUS CHRIST is your Lord and Savior, so that through Him, your name will be written in the Book of Life.    "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever BELIEVES in Him  should not perish but have everlasting life.  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved." (JOHN 3:16-17 NKJV)   ✝️ By God's GRACE, the gift of Salvation and Eternal Life is available to all. You can RECEIVE it. You can REJECT it. May you choose wisely.
I'm definitely addicted to my phone!!!  Sometimes I leave it at home by mistake when I leave for work.   And I really feel like I'm going through phone withdrawal.   But after 8 hours of not having it, I never knew what I needed it for anyway.   I do watch alot of YouTube though!!!
Qualoty cruise lines have amazing food
The Russian icebreaker reminds me of a guy I knew who had been stationed in Panama. Every week he would buy a bunch of cassette tapes from the PX bargain bin, then each Saturday morning stand on the bank of the Canal. Whenever a Russian tanker or navy ship went by, the Russian sailors would yell AMERICA! ROCK N ROLL!! He would throw them some cassettes and they would always throw something back to him. He had a Soviet compass watch, a bayonet, some rank pins, black market Soviet porn magazines (sailors are sailors everywhere 😁). He only smoked one of the Russian cigarettes. Who know how much some of that stuff was worth to collectors?
Too bad that we can't put Kara and Nate on ship to Mars.  I think they'd make that look fun!  Lord knows Mars would be excited to have them!   Love all of your videos.  Here's to your health and happiness!
Çok paradır bu tur be,  Türkiyede bir çok insanın hayatını değişterecek türden bi para.
If you destroy the ice at the pole you make it thinner and with time the ice will be gone so ship for pleasure as absolutely no business there you are dispicable
Your doing great
Keep the good work uppp
That snow room looks brutally cold. Highlight of the video was the camera falling 😱
I just loved the snowball fight :D!
Omg I love u guys!!! I just started watching your travels and its amazing! Kara u are so cute and funny. I love how you mention all the stuff that are included and how u love free stuff and are going to try all the smoothies cause it's all  included! Every time i think of a question about cost you mention the answer! I love how u exercise to eat more! Right back at u😁! Looking forward to watching more of your travels 🥰🥰
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
11:53 that kind of wind speeds can be pretty normal in winter where I live (north of Scotland)
LEAKED:  Nate's challenge is trying to run a marathon on a cruise ship :p
i just wanna know what the trainers (sorry i'm English, Sneakers) are that you've been wearing? the black and white ones?
I know im addicted to my phone idk what to do without it all the time. That wind was blowing so hard.
There is no internet on the ship??? Omg definitely the only con 😂 I get disconnecting for a few days but almost three weeks is a lot for me😂
that moment 9:40 give the movie locked in sauna vibes
Nope 👎 @10:20 that Stirfry/Fried ice cream from Thailand,Teppanyaki ice cream is Japanese way to pan fried/ hot iron cooking You where right they are wrong unless the tteatime is in a Japanese restaurant then it would be called Teppanyaki
The most beautiful part of this video is near the end where you encountered the Russian nuclear powered icebreaker with it's friendly and enthusiastic passengers all up on deck waving flags and shouting "Bonjour".  The passengers on your ship seemed a little less enthusiastic but at least I didn't see any middle fingers being raised.   In that moment you could see how insane it is that the US Zio-media and US government (ZOG) have demonized the Russian people in order to foment this insane war with Ukraine which could easily turn nuclear destroying life on earth as we know it.   Your brand new ship is very beautiful and luxurious but it has a lot of new unproven propulsion technologies for a ship designed to go to the North Pole. If your ship becomes disabled (or subsequent voyages) it will be Russian nuclear powered Icebreakers like that one that will come to your rescue. It won't be the U.S. Coast Guard! It won't be the French Navy!  There is NO ONE but the Russians who can come to your aid in time to save your life if your ship to the North Pole breakdowns and becomes stranded in an ice field at the top of the world.  Under such a scenario how long do you think they could keep the 5-star service on-board going?  It could be said that the Russian icebreaker makes these voyages possible.  Hopefully all the American (and NATO country) passengers on this ship got a better appreciation of Russia after seeing that Russian icebreaker and it's welcoming crew and passengers.
How much a cruise like this cost?
I can’t describe how much I want to do this trip.  I expected it to be a lot of money, but looking into it, with the single supplement they charge, it’s just way too much, and despite how amazing it would be, just too much enough for it probably not to be worth the years of saving for it.  Oh well, back to living vicariously through Kara & Nate….
💕
Think seeing the icebreaker was a highlight?   Consider:  The sailors on the Russian icebreaker had been and would be out there for a lot longer.   Now multiply your excitement.
Loving this series!
I am touched more by some commentators who sincerely believe that the war is somewhere out there and it will not affect them, and the Russian people are very against it, Putin is just such a bad one. In Russia, for years they have been talking about American enemies, and enemies around the country in general. At the same time, they were infuriated that these "enemies" live well, unlike Russians. And now hundreds of thousands of ordinary Russians go to shows dedicated to supporting murders, rapes and bombings in the territory of another country.Yeah, that's just "wonderful" people live there.
"Where is The Rock from?" I DIEEEDDD HHAHAHA
I SO NEED TO GO ON THIS CRUISE 🛳  GAHHHH!
no regerts....... eat the pancakes hah
How many bones are in the human hand?      A handful of them.
Not the server RUNNING for that olive oil cap! Just shows the amazing service from this cruise
Looks like an amazing trip! I mean, it would cool to say you'd been the North Pole but that amazing ship is what is giving me vacation envy. I'd be in that sauna every day! Plus, the two of you always are such cheerful travelers, I enjoy watching you enjoy the trip. 🙂
It just doesn't have enough activities on board.
11:11 the beginning of the scene where they reference neature. Screaming😂😂
What kind of stone is on your engagement ring finger? I understand you travel a lot so you're not wearing your diamond (for safety reasons). And by the way your trip to the North Pole looks really fascinating. It looks like the both of you are having a good time. I love to watch your travels . You two make me feel like I'm right there with you, thank you.
You are kidding right? Did I really just see a section devoted to cheering and celebrating a Russian state-owned icebreaker? Are you two completely tone deaf? And you post your video on the 6-month anniversary of the terrible war Russia has inflicted on the people of Ukraine. And on that day Russia attacked civilians at a train station and killed at least 22. But hey, you two cheer on the murderous people of Russia and enjoy your spas and free sponsored trips. Its not like YOU TWO are suffering is it? I will unsubscribe and stick with the much better traveling couple (with the redhead wife). The couple where the wife doesn't sing and hand-style her way through life like a Price is Right flunky. Bye Felecia! Slava Ukraine!
this is thrilling! incredible journey, with incredible people.
I love how Kara tears up seeing the Russian ship! You're the best
Its says i won a prize just cant find where to reply its from this video ?? Is it a scam says something like telegram me reply here you won a prize but when i click on it  under notifications its not here .
haha americans can be so annoying in just beeing and talking.. :*
i am ALWAYS hungrier when i workout - i 100% agree, a great workout to put in a good mood for the day and all. the. food - i never want to waste a meal! :P
14:08 the one doing ✌️ is kinda cute. I’m sorry😅
I never really wore hats regularly growing up so I was never explicitly told to take off my hat but I *know* in churches and like the national anthem and everything to take it off but in terms of dinner and nice restaurants... I find it so baffling when people make such a big deal about it... I see it as just another piece of clothing. I don't see a possible unnecessary rude accessory being specifically worn.  That would be like "take off ur shirt! its rude to wear that" like i see no difference in importance of the clothing item and rudeness..
That other boat ran on Nuclear energy.
Loved the ted talk in between 😛
Never thought I would ever see a snow ball fight inside of a ship.
You're aware that Russia is busy killing Ukrainians by the thousands currently and that most Russians support this war?  They are not fun party friends.
Nate, It’s a SHIP.  It is NOT a  BOAT.   There is a difference ! Love ya’ll anyway.
Loved this episode. Curiosity for those of us that suffer motion sickness with even the slightest, did you have that motion levels where you felt the rocking and ice splitting? It seemed rough that one say and the boat looked rocky.  That is my only hesitancy with Arctic cruises…the terrible motion sickness I would suffer.
Kara is my spirit animal. “My main reason for going to the gym is so I can eat more.” Same girl, same!!!
Kara,  Poley weather is my favorite 🤠❤️
I'm going to open a special savings account so maybe one day I can go on that ship to the north pole!!
Nate and his no show socks at the North Pole is KILLING me...it's August in NJ and I am freezing just looking at him and his ankles walking around the deck after dinner!
Kara crying after seeing the other ship is ME. I teared up on a Carnival cruise honking back and forth to another Carnival cruise 😂😂
Thank you guys for taking us to see something that we probably won’t get to do ourselves and also keeping it so fun and spending time so well!!!
Although I "love" you.... I've been on a few VERY expensive cruises (I know... very privileged etc etc)... but you, Nate, in the restaurant with your hat on backwards was the very FIRST thing that came into my head. PLEASE respect the crew and the other customers by not doing that again.  Bad on you!  LOL.. back to the video!
Well I’m upset cause we love cruising and really mentally added this one to my bucket list until I saw that this ships cruise to north pole averaged 40000. I mean how. Dang I should’ve idk maybe stayed in school even longer lol.  Guess I would’ve been in the engine deck of the Russian ship lol.
Please make a comment about Steve Wallis and his wife's passing. Thanks, guys
This is so cool!! I’d totally be exercising to be extra hungry like Kara 🤣
I am loving y'all so much! I am sooooo addicted to my phones rearranged my apps, and I am basically lost.lol
If I had the money I'd definitely do this cruise, ship is amazing and reaching North Pole would be awesome experience! Can't wait for the next episode 😁
So,  have you guys been paying attention to what is going on in Ukraine.  So many people are being killed, raped, tortured, kids kidnapped, possessions stolen.  All by or supported by Russians.  loved the rest of the show but was really turned off by your jubilance at seeing a russian ship.
Not me getting cold watching Kara and Nate outside watching the snow 😂
I am planning a cruise…. What a great adventure!!  You guys Are always so fun and informative❣️❣️❣️
I love you guys so much it’s crazy
I love the cold weather please enjoy it for me 🙏🏽😭
This is a dream yo
What an incredible experience.  And LOLOL at Kara’s hair after being in the wind.  And the snow room, what fun!  The staff seem fabulous and fun while being professional.  Glad there were activities for such a long ‘at sea’ time.  Thanks for sharing this and all your incredible experiences.  Some of the things the two of you have done I’ve never even heard of like the crazy races you find; but each video is so much fun. Thanks for being there for us
"Forced" to go off grid on a cruise to the north pole, god that's gotta be tough.
If you have to wear a mask on any of these cruises I’m  out. there’s no way I’m wearing an effing mask they don’t work and you don’t need them
Say hi to Santa for me!
Kara I feel that😂 I also workout to eat more hahahah
Kara I feel that😂 I also workout to eat more hahahah
I loved the ending!
I cry every time Kara cries! The exchange with the Russian ship was just beautiful.
Jesus loves you
Gleefully waving at a Russian ship - I'm embarrassed for both of you on how insensitive that is to the free world while you jaunt around like spoiled children
thank goodness for girls with no class or self respect
My dad used to say fix your hat or I'll fix your head to match your hat.  To each his own but nobody will take you seriously if you wear your hat backwards.
That cruise ship must have INCREDIBLE insulation for you two to be able to run around in your robe and slippers despite the outside temp being SO cold! Also, I imagine being so close to the North Pole, you had 24-seven daylight  (and would have six months of nightfall had you gone in winter). Great seeing that other ship so close! Look forward to hearing about you two reaching the Pole!  I hope Santa and company appreciated your stopping by 😄! Thanks for this!
New sub here just found you on Ludwig channel he went through the 50 trending on YouTube and I found this video it looked so awesome great job subbed and liked
05:22 Come on, those French Fries were too big to be French fries - they were chunky chips
The snow fight was great...I was laughing right along with you! I loved Nate's apology before he threw the first  "punch". Hope you find a polar bear!
Hi "If you're like me, you think about living out these glorious cruises every day! Kara and Nate's new healthy habit (gym) really hit me, because who wouldn't want to go to the gym with those breathtaking views and topnotch service? Quickest way to a lifestyle filled with these beautiful experiences is through knowledge on building wealth. Knowledge is POWER
Its lovely snow fight.love u guys
Very helpful in me getting my Concealed weapons permit
Knowledge is POWER.
"If you're like me, you think about living out these glorious cruises every day

Wow it's very beautiful 😻
Just Loved It✨️ Keep It Up👏
lovely this video. Excellent explanation.
newest comment
This video is one of the best important & helpful video. We need more this type video. Thank you
Did you ever see anyone else walking around the deck or swimming? Xxx
Amazing video. Explanation too good and understanding. Thank you for your sharing.
It,s great video
I need to be off the grid. I am so addicted to my phone!
The people on the boat are so cute 😭😭❤
dont forget to say hi to santa when you get there.
Kara and Nate you should go to Scotland soon ……..Orkney  magical……
My grandparents just went on a cruise to the North Pole and my first thought was “I wonder if Kara and Nate are on that?” Still wondering if it’s the same one! Gonna have to ask them about it when they get back. UPDATE: MY GRANDMA IS IN THE BACK OF THE FIRST BREAKFAST CLIP
Probably a couple of submarines down below too.
The way Kara said “Bonjour” at 20:02 put a smile on my face
I very annoyed !! I want the other parts!. I need parts 3 to 5 allrready!
who else feels aggravated with jealousy after watching these videos?
Loving this North Pole series! And Kara, I totally agree about our addiction to phones or just looking up EVERYTHING on Google.  Great tip about rearranging apps on your phone!  Can't wait to see you guys get to the North Pole! Peace and love❤
Love it!!!  You have really captured the highlights of an amazing adventure!!!
Wow now that's a cool cruise. 10/10
If you ever wondered what being married to your best friend looks like ❤️🙏🏽😇 #choosewisely #greatlife
I’m sorry but Santa clause lives in the North Pole. Can’t be just water and frozen water
You are just adorable, guys! Especially Kara-- I love your honesty and fun. You seem to live fixing around, and it's so much fun watching. No fake stuff!!
Nates thick, polar jacket plus exposed ankles at about 11.5 minutes in 🤣
It looks like a good trip. You guys are awesome. Continue traveling..... 🥰😍😘🤩
I prob won't ever be able to afford this...but so happy to live vicariously through these videos! Looks amazing
Hello; ok let me start with I love you both and your channel , for many years now. BUT. I am the (single) mom to a teenage daughter who recently developped anorexia and happens to follow you too. I just wanyed to make you aware that influencers such as you have a huge impact, especially when it comes to lifestyle and diet... Just to put things in perspective, my girl has now been going twice to the ER and full hospi because of her anorexia and how bad she was from it close to heart failure. Now i am not here to lecture you, or blame you,just wanted to make you aware of what an imapct you, as content creators you can have
Really? Come to Therme Erding (the largest saunas in the world) we will teach you proper sauna culture. 🤣😉
The sauna with that view is amazing 🤩
Boring both of them  Get out there back side there like little kids hate to be anywhere with them
The transitions with the ice were really cool ❄️
Geographic north (also called "true north") is the direction towards the fixed point we call the North Pole. Magnetic north is the direction towards the north magnetic pole, which is a wandering point where the Earth's magnetic field goes vertically down into the planet.
Wear that damn hat to eat or whenever you feel like it!  Anyone that has a problem with your hat needs to focus on fixing themselves to perfection.  SMH
What a great way to disconnect!
Omg I wanna do this
Thank you for publishing this video and sharing your experience of your trip. I probably will never go on a cruise to the North Pole in my lifetime. So this is the closest experience I can get from you showing this on youtube. You did a wonderful job on this video, thanks again for sharing!
This is awesome but just so incredibly expensive. $40,000 per person for 17 days… insane.
these two have very BAD/unhealthy skin!
Not saying single word of support to Ukraine, crying because of russian propaganda ship. Well done, Yep, not all russians are bad, putin bombing cities all by himself
14:48 almost lost the camera and her wine but the bread was safe 😂😂😂
Romans 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
Real life "Sorry,..Not Sorry" when Nate picks up the snow ❄️ and it immediately turns into a laughing snowfight! 🛳❄️🌬🥶☃️ 🤣 Almost thought for a second that Nate was genuinely shocked when Kara said she took a nap instead of working out...then he had to lunge for the falling camera 📷! lol!
It's crazy how people can tell you what to do and if you do something wrong there after you telling you your Wrong but if you tell them there doing something wrong there offended 😂 It's TOTALLY fine if you wear a hat in a restaurant if you have to 😁you guys are the BEST 🤣🥰Love yall
That camera catch though!!
oh thats neat! love that they threw in neature show refferance
1:45 You don't have to worry about eating bad Nate if you are consuming AG1 from Athletic Greens
To answer Kara’s question about who else exercises to improve their appetite, there is one famous example: Winnie The Pooh, so you’re in good company 😁
Love this, and the whole series! Can't wait for the next episode!!
Ik Denmark when it's serious we get 40 m/s or roughly 140kmh
7:59 onwards, to save the guys scrolling. Shame she hasn't got a better rack 🤣
Omg! How much does this cost????
"An OLD ice breaker.. who knows when" *ice breaker built in my year of birth* Me: olldd??I've never been so triggered xD Jokes aside, Thanks for showing us trips that most of us will never get to go on. Living vicariously through the both of you. Keep it up!
I don't know why I watch this to be honest,. Chasing dreams that will never be fulfilled..i want to travel the world and experience culture so bad, but even if I put in 70 hours a week, there's no hope..
Hello,sir, I am the marketing agent of CoinPark. We have been following your YouTube account for a long time. We sincerely hope to cooperate with you to promote our platform, and we will pay you commission。 If you are interested in learning more, please reply to me
Your travel vlogs are so innovative and so much different. Usually, I find out from your vlogs that such kind of weird tourism exist in this world. Before this video, I thought only scientists visits North pole. Why on Earth, you will visit North pole as tourist? I was so wrong. This is just so beautiful and so informative at the same time. Cheers from India!
The thought that you were thinking about joining this expedition on RUSSIAN ship while this terrible war is happening - is just blowing my mind. No comments.
you guys HAVE TO visit zimbabwe sometime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And stay in malilangwe at pamushana lodge ITS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I live here and I can tell you honestly ITS AMAZING... well the bush is... not so much the towns 😅
🖤
The man running to pick up the lid for u was sooo sweet
Definitely not digging the love and joy towards the Russian ship.  That made me feel uncomfortable and quite grossed out.  Just saying....
Thank you guys, this was so fun to watch. I would love to go to the North Pole on a cruise.
Do it again in 6 months. Lol :D
How privileged are you!!!  This is my ultimate DREAM NR 1 ON MY BUCETLIST!!!!! Where can I find a sponsor for me and my daughter to do this????
As someone who loves snow and doesn’t have 40 some thousand dollars. You’re making me really want to do this 😂
0h you make me want to go to the North Pole!
I remember 12 days ago 9:36 he said as long as it isn't line dancing...10:13 KARA: which I should totally attend lol
One thing I was thinking about, was the fact that in order to enjoy yourself you must have to stay in the present moment no matter what! If you don’t you run the risk of not enjoying yourself lol. I think this is super awesome though. I just went on vacation on a plane for the first time in about eight years and let me tell you what, walking through the airport for an hour and a half before your flight and then getting on your flight for another hour and a half or more depending on who you are. All of that mixed with getting out of the airport getting your luggage going to the hotel man it’s exhausting! It must be difficult on another side of things to do all of that traveling and you have to love it or you wouldn’t do it because it is exhausting! Although I still want to travel one day and get paid for it and I would love to have a YouTube Channel someday! Hope you guys are having a wonderful day! And keep doing your thing because I love watching your videos and you always inspire me to do more!
who cares abt where and whene u where your hat, youre living the dream, love u guys, from across the pond :)
This is literally amazing and so fun! I hope one day I can do this!
Bunch of hat nazis, sheesh.  Times change and hats inside are totally acceptable in today's society.  I got the same grief from my dad growing up, and despite his best efforts to make me not wear hats indoors or at dinner tables, it never stuck, and nobody else has ever seemed to care.
@14:39 I died laughing at my desk at Kara's reaction. Too cute!!!!
i love this omg
Please use metrics only in the future.
the food they eating at that fancy dinner really looks healthy
I spent almost three weeks in the South African bush. I refused to look at email. And when we did get even spotty wifi in the evening, i used it to listen to music and send my obligation whatsapp message to my family that I'm still alive with like three pictures. Then I go back to the boma and talk with my friends around the fire. I told my best friend tell me about the work craziness with the inmates when I get back. I guess what I'm saying is that when you take a trip like that, make it a consensus decision to mentally not even bother to check once you get on the plane to go.
What’s wrong with the hat!?!? Wear it as much as you want!!!!
The boat is breaking the ice faster than it has too :( it’s actually really bad for the environment these north pole cruises :/
So much fun in the snow room! What about jumping into the ice water after the sauna? Huh, that would be the memory of life!
Wait! How long does a polar bear mom take care of her cubs?!
Hi Kara & Nate. My Wife and I sure do enjoy watching your videos from America, but we love our country, and refuse to watch any videos from other countries. Is Nate going to wear his Buckee's outfit in India? I guess we will never know. As soon as you start posting videos from other countries, we will be unsubscribing from your channel. Thank you so much for all the enjoyment we have gotten, and good luck over seas.
Haha y’all are the best
😊😊😊
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO SO MUCH
Oh wow just had a serendipity moment watching the video when Nate said it's 11:02 pm it was exactly 11:02am on my phone wow crazy.
so funny we have 2 guests on a multi million dollar ice breaker cruise ship and they are having a snowball fight  luv it way to go guys
Nate and Kara this boat is so pretty. Olson much to do. I have vertigo it would be bad fore to be on a boat. Looks really amazing to be on that  boat. Enjoy 😍🥰🤣😂😜😃
Yes Kara relate 100%
YALL SHOULD TRAVEL TO TRINIDAD  💻
Omg!! The snowball fight was epic!  Nate you crack me up.
have you found Santa yet?
Somehow my mind wandered to, “So if something wipes out civilization while you’re gone, your two ships will be responsible for repopulating the earth.” It’s nice that your blind date with them went so well. 😉🤔
Omg this video made me so happy. Haha why was I cheesing along with you guys when the ship was passing hahaha
Loving this Arctic Adventure 💯🥰🥰🥰
I really enjoy your videos but miss the bumbling  inexperienced Yankees of old. However when you doing advertorials or paid promotions like this it would be helpful if upfront you mentioned this and perhaps de monetised content where the content is paid or promoting a product or service. Honesty is your greatest asset.
How much is the total cost
i have not watched yall in so long 😭😭😭
I like there's an adventure to this trip... completely new and different to Antarctica. That said, I feel like you guys can explore many more train rides across countries like New Zealand and Australia! Please do :D
Are Kara and Nate polyamorous?
Ooooohhh -12C! I live in Winnipeg Manitoba and we often get -45C when you add temperature and wind together ( that’s what makes wind chill).  😂
The captain speaking along with the font and font animation had me dying 🤣😂💀
Shout-out to the Pinoy crew onboard! You guys rock!
The end part of the vid gave me goosebumps Nice video as always 😊❤️
Let's hope the Russians take better care of the reactor on that ship than the one they invaded in Ukraine.  Love your channel guys, but this made my blood go cold. Almost as if I was on the ice with you.
This makes my fear of cruises less terrifying! I think I would love this!
I think that’s the most we’ve ever heard Nate laugh!! I demand more of this! 😂😂
You make me laugh you are awesome
Probably the first time in history someone actually was happy to come across Russians, anywhere. Glad to know you are the type of people who considered financing genocide just to save some money on your trip, until you convinced some French cruise line to comp you for your trip.
You guys are amazing!!! Kara’s laugh is everything! Love you guys ❤️
You picked the right boat to go to the North pole! Definitely the better choice! Loved the snow fight! Stay safe!
When does the next episode drop?
Nate’s face when he almost got blow away by wind was so funney
you guys are awesome, happy you went back on the road, I'll defenetly start saving for this cruise 😁
Love love love your videos! So inspirational and the best editing I’ve ever seen!!!! Love everything. 🥰 But Nate, that hat, you’ll go bald so much sooner if you keep wearing it, trust me..! 😋 You guys missed the eastern coast of VIC, NSW and QLD Australian… beautiful coast line and inner travel line is as equally beautiful…! Also so much more to see in vic…;)
i never take my hat off... it shouldnt matter to anyone what im wearing, if it does.. oh well. lol
My favorite people on YouTube!! I love you guys! Y’all are the highlight of my week!!!
The way Kara talks, she’s brilliant
That was a fun episode. I had a good laugh seeing your two reactions when you came in from the windy balcony. 😆😆 “nature” 😆
Just imagine falling into that ocean
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
😂😂😂
Omg this is sooo wonderful I’m not a cold weather person so I’m living vicariously through y’all keep having fun I’m glad I found y’all I just subscribed today 🥰🥰🥰
Hey Nate I got a challenge for you to do so the ironman triathlon a 2.4 Mike swim a 112 mile bike and marathon the one in Hawaii you got quality for that one
Wowowow, i just went to check the prices of the cruise...starting at 35.000€/$ all the way up 120.000 per person......oups, I'll have to win the lottery...glad Kara & Nate can discover it for us!
That ship is pure luxury ..too bad I get sea sick ( & definitely can't afford it) or I would've loved to experience that trip of a lifetime!.. You two look like the youngest by far on there so maybe it's out of a lot of people's reach! ..My Daughter turns 6 tomorrow (!6! Omg time goes way too fast!! ) & I've been feeling all teary eyed.. My Son just turned 1 ..I'm losing my babies lol ..this video cheered me up no end! A huge thank you for the upload from little old me 😄🥰
I love the channel and love the content. One thing a lot of creators do that I don't understand. Why the black tape on the laptop logo or any product logo? The idea of "sponsor me, or I'm not showing your product" drives me nuts. If you use their product and it helps make your life easier, didn't they do a good job? Isn't that enough to promote or give them credit by showing their branding? I might be completely wrong, and there's a whole other reason for that; if so, please someone explain.
Happy for you but really do we really need to go north pole and add to the pollution.
So wholesome 🥰
Giggling so hard at the snowball fight! Favorite video yet! And I’ve watched allll of them!!
I’m sorry but Kara trying to speak French hurts me 🤣
So, I lost how much Nate weighs in the past year and would love to lose what Kara weighs in the next year or so. I'm so motivated to get fit again! And think I deserve a cruise like this one when I have succeeded 😁
can giuoc town waiting you two?
So, you saw Orcs. I can see you want to keep the energy positive by not mentioning a thing of what actually matters.
I wish i could do this, but it's so expensive 😭😍🫣
Hello from Minnesota USA!! Really fantastic episode!!
I can relate to you Kara. I love food too but unlike you I hate working out. I prefer to do 45 minute workouts 4 days a week and do intermittent fasting. Ps. You have the nicest legs on YouTube.
Santa….?
What time is it at the North Pole or what time zone is the North Pole in? Did you see Santa Clauses home?
nate grow a beard not a go t
I am sorry to say this, but as a true Belgian citizen, I have to. We have sometimes some problems with the word: French fries, this because Belgians believe it is from our country, and it is. So please, if it is possible, say Belgian fries or just fries instead of French fries. Thank you from a happy Belgian guy.
Wow. People actually go on vacation to intentionally break through ice when the ice melt is progressing so rapidly?  And there is actual excitement as the ship plows through the ice?
It’s wonderful to see your daily routine and inspiring that you are keeping in shape. Definitely understand working out to be more hungry so you can enjoy the amazing food offered! The visuals in this video are just out of this world! Love that you keep showing metric and standard distances/temps/etc.
Since you have traveled almost everywhere.. have you thought about where and/or how you’ll retire someday… when your ready to? I’m just curious.
I Love It !!!!
Completely amazing.....so gladyou are sharing with us....most of us would never be able to afford or take this trip.
where Santa
You guys keep adding the expensive trips on my list😂. I just live through your videos
Now you can say you have been to both the South and the North pole
Looks amazing !  Checked out the website, 16 night cruise starts from $50,000.00 AUD. OMG !!!!!
Nate really enjoyed the snow fight hahaha
The phone addiction struggle is real. Switching around apps is a good idea!  (Anyone else miss bloops?)
The food is amazing when you consider that it cannot be delivered fresh to the ship every day. Most will be from the freezer by the end of the cruise.
Your edits have came so HILARIOUSLY FAR!!!! I love this!!!!
I actually paused the video to read some of those comments on screen about you wearing a hat to the restaurant. How actually sad that people feel the need to be negative. If you want to be a KAREN don't bother commenting
Movie DATE NIGHT (2010) with Steve Carell and Tina Fey.... When Tina's character puts in her retainer before bed,  Steve's character knows he is not getting any......  Hahaha
Loved the snow fight!
I know you guys can’t really film other people but I swear it looks like you guys are the only passengers on the boat. 🤣
Seeing that red icebreaker was quite something….I’m looking forward to ep 3! 🇳🇿🇳🇿🐑🐑NZ
The snow fight was great! And the ship passing by was so heartfelt. Loving this series ❤️
omg i’m litterally on a ponant ship rn as i watch this !!!
I only wish I could be on that boat, one of my bucket list, so great to follow y’all around on your trips, makes my day!  Can’t wait for the next one! Y’all should take a break and hit Dollywood!!
Os vídeos de vocês só melhoram, amei!! Loved it!
Yet another fantastic adventure! I'm curious how you offset the CO2 from all your travels?
Hi Kara and Nate 😊 I am from New Zealand and I absolutely love watching your videos and have been following your journey for years! You’re my inspiration and I hope to travel with someone I love just like you two 🛫
Keep up the good work. It's amazing that you guys are doing this it's a lot more experience for you guys. Have fun😀😀😀😀😀
Wow, what a trip and what a ship. I am definitely putting this on my bucketlist but the price of this cruise is out of this world £30k per person 😅😆 One day I’ll do it. You guys are so lucky!
Kara and Nate, in fact, our meeting near the North Pole can really be considered historical. We, the passengers of the ship, were just as insanely pleased to meet you. (By the way, there were 66 most talented children from all over Russia on board the ship, and I am one of them 🙃🙃🙃) Thank you for the incredible videos, they allow me to plunge into those incredible days again and again and realize that the cold Arctic  left the most heartwarming memories in my life, which are unlikely to ever be forgotten
So I changed the order of apps on my phone . I moved the app icon of insta.. it's working great.  But there is a food app in the same place now and I order more food now .. now I am fat 😅
Waving to the Russian ship is the bottom
Fantastic video I laughed so much
Hey! Well done! Just one commercial in this vlog . . . but then, wait a minute, add on to that the youtube ads that seem to come on every 5 mins. PLUS the fact that the vlog was probably sponsored by the cruise company, THEN you realise that the whole vlog and everything in it is one long commercial . . . all done with the usual pearly white smiles . . . . AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHGG!!!!!!
you guys should get castify cases for your macs (if they are macs) instead of duct tape lmao
Nate laughing while obliterating Kara with snow was hysterical.  The Russian ship passing was my favorite part
How much is this trip???
It's sad to see you're ignorant to war situation that is happening because of Russia and even worse that you were considering going on a cruise with them.  And I really liked your videos.. This will definitely decrease the number of people who watch you. Unless you don't really care who watches..
AAAAND , you are just close to half o the trip, you need to come back :)
Nate, please take off your ball cap when you are inside. Especially when you are in a church (not a synagogue, leave it on in a synagogue). Especially take your ball cap off in a dining facility and a hospital or nursing home. When you're exercising, use a sweat band. Then you don't wind up with a smelly ball cap.   At 15:00 or thereabouts, you had a lovely jazz track as you fed each other dinner -- very, very nice!
I love the last moment! I think I got teary eyed too 😭😭
8:52 all it takes is for someone to ruin the snow spa room with a little yellow….😤
im 5ft 3 and i eat so much for my height because im so active like you Kara, so its definitely a benefit because we get to eat more hehee xx
One thing for how much time you spend on it... my phone has a section where it shows how much time you spend on each app... it can be surprising how much time you spend on the phone.
My fav part Is the snowball fight
That guy literally ran to pick up that olive oil cap, thats some amazing service
Can't believe that you are so happy to see Russian icebreaker in 2022. Russia is killing thousands of us these days.
The Captain's voice is so relaxing!
Well! That was fun, especially the other ice breaker.  😊❄️
Your videos never get old love watching you to .. also Nate I still like my coffee haha 😂
Hola kara and Nate! Once again THANKS for sharing your beautiful experiences and adventures! This Artic Cruise is just been added to my bucket list for a great vacation! Miguel 🇵🇷
One of my favorite videos of yours. Nate running to the camera saying don't fall in the ocean made me laugh to hard cause he looked like a toddler running because he was so stiff lol. And just so many real like clips in this video which is my favorite thing ugh I JUST LOVE THIS SERIES SO FAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everyone is life should get to experience things like this . Like a bucket list paid for by the state at least one . That is magical . Why does life have to be rough for most people .
Magnetic north pole is actually the South pole
There's not many passengers on  that cruise. I know the ship is new but that must be a very specialized market of cruisers. Ponant must be worried about low sales. Maybe that's why Nate and Kara are making a five part infomercial for them. I would be bored out of my mind with that white on white on white monotony.
Definitely a bucket list trip
I typically do not get jealous of other people....,but  BUT I'M TOTALLY JEALOUS!!!!!!!  Absolutely Amazing!
32 grands for one person? How is this even possible.
Thank you for showing us this cool polar scenery when its 95 degrees here 🥵 😂 living vicariously through you guys
It’s still a completely bogan thing to wear a hat to dinner. Totally cringe. The fact that you took no notice of prior comments says a lot about you. All confidence and no class. You’re punching above your weight with Kara. You’re still young enough to lift your game,
This episode was so joyful. You get me leaning in to watch and not miss anything.   🦭 Great eyes finding the seal.  🚢 What fun seeing the other only ship and everyone out on deck and waving with the horns blowing. A beautiful memory forever. Thank you.
EYE 2 LOVE FOOD
can't wait for episode 3
bro imagine complaining about someone just wearing a hat backwards 💀
Thumbnail 7:53
Why would you want to support a russian company during this terrible time!?
The fact that the guy was so serious on the boat  picking up that cap he like rushed lol 😝
Russians.. They are freaking everywhere.
The Rock is from here in Hawaii!!! Where you guys need to come! I love you guy’s videos, can’t wait to see the rest of the series!!!
A Bucket List item I never knew I wanted...THANK YOU
Come all the way to the North pole only to greet your fellow travelers in a bathrobe. That's worse than wearing a hat to the dining hall! 😂😂 I kid of course!! Such an awesome video and amazing experience!!!
I was just imagining both of you jumping and screaming when you realised this trip, of anyone’s lifetime, was confirmed.
If was me seeing the Russian ice breaker ship I would be waving  the Ukrainian flag at them !
I never knew this was a thing but I’d like to experience it
wow!!! you lovely couples are having the best time of your life.. both of you are living my dream and millions more❤️ How blessed will be your kids to watch all of your amazinh adventures. K&N always inspires to travel and enjoy life to the fullest..
Bro fucking jumped for that olive oil cap!
I thought I’d book tickets for one of these cruises, but it was £30k! So I won’t be doing that.
This is the most North Poley weather we've had yet 🤣 And you can totally tell by the buffet tour how very little Kara cares about desserts! Snow fight, wind battles and passing ships; what a great vlog!
Working out to be hungry so I can eat again is the only reason I workout 🏋️‍♂️
This series may be the best one yet 😍😍
For pov of being a baby about to fall out of a chair, skip to 14:36
I can relate Kara! :D
YOU ARE AMAZING GUYS🤩😍LOVE U💛💙
Work out all you want Kara you still look 45
Funny I was actually Googling "Is the North Pole on land"......and it showed me a map of North Pole AK.  (=  Love this series!!!!
You guys need to put on sunscreen
I’ve never thought of taking a boat to the North Pole, but it’s suddenly on my bucket list! Thanks for this guys
It’s like a hurricane reporting 💨💨
The ship should have a dance party to “ I’m on top of the world” by imagine dragons one you get To the North Pole
travel Channel don't have sh*t on Kara and Nate.
$35,000 per person to do this.... damn!
I love this so much
Winds here in newfoundland quite often reach 100+ km
Snowball fight was awesome 😎
Kara is 59kls but skinny and why Im 60kls and chubby! 😅🤣😂
omg Kara...the part about being addicted to ur phone....RELATABLE 💯‼️Girl....I feel ya!!
I think it would be valuable if you two held off on the fat phobic comments. You have so many subscribers are people who look up to you so it’s important you don’t comment on calories or working out etc to earn food as many folks struggle with eating disorders etc
I’m really surprised you guys didn’t have internet on this cruise. I was on an ice breaker’97-99 and we were able to go online and send and receive emails from the polar regions even way back then.
Live when the two ships were talking to each other.
I had to laughed out loud when Kara came in from the wind.  Her hair.  The snowball fight🤣 great content too!
i just looked to see how much this cost, because it looks fantastic.  OMG!  i couldn't afford this in a gazillion years!
I would love to see you two hike the Pacific Crest Trail.
The most "North poly" weather....   WHY DID THIS MAKE ME LAUGH SO HARD.... 💀
What a unique, once in a lifetime experience!  Definitely fun videos to watch.
Kara - “always have French fries. My favorite.”  Me - “Mine too!! 😄
Hat? That's an issue? Lol, I had to rewind that section of the video to make sure I got it right, and the comments! Oh goodness - so many opinions on a hat! Lol, I didn't even notice you wore one - it really doesn't matter to me. But then, I'm Norwegian, and we have different social rules I guess :D
Did you know that ‘Arctic’ means bears (or near the bear) and ‘Antarctic’ means no bears  (or away, or opposite, the bear). I think the ‘Bear’ refers to ‘The Great Bear’ constellation, but how freaky that there are actually no bears in Antarctica 🤯
Hey I wear my hat in church!👊🙌💯🙏 hat love dude
Geographic, True, North pole is where your off too, The magnetic one, which moves constantly as the earth wobbles on its axis is currently somewhere near Ellesmere Island. A difference of about 500 miles. "The Rock", or Dwanye Johnson, Is of the Samoan Miavia family, but he is from Hayward California.
Watched this and thinking I should do this before I die someday... Googled the price of the cruise and immediately changed my mind.🤣 I guess watching this VLOG is enough for now.
After years of following you, you guys just keep getting funnier. “Where is the rock” from killed me
In.credible!  👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Wow!! It’s a dream
People telling you not to wear a hat in a restaurant? I hate to use the phrase but Ok boomers I'm 32 I wear hats all the time who cares.
Nate I love you better with a hat on😎
Not disagreement but a debate. I’m just waiting thoroughly enjoying your beautiful cruise to the North Pole
Love the video, but call me crazy, I just can't get behind a commercial cruise liner smashing through precious ice sheets seals, polar bears, and other animals call home. It reminds me of the movie Avatar. The ice sheets are already melting  and breaking away and I feel like this is just accelerating the process.
Is there any place you guys haven't explored? OMG...... God bless you both. Travel safe...
You know what I never want to experience on an expensive luxury cruise? A man playing Hotel California on a violin. Lol
Mask theater in the North Pole
Ooh, the ice cream! Yum!
I'm really impressed with your video guys!! It's incredible 😻 it actually changed my mood!! This is the first time I wrote a comment for a YouTuber "celebrity" in general. But it's worth tho!🤍 I'm one of your fans actually following you for a while. Keep doing that guys. Love you all the way from 🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦. You have to come over to Connecticut.
19:50 Kara with her retainers on might be the most adorable thing I've seen in some time.
The they you
How much is this exact cruise?
Throwing a snowball at your wife, Nate, might be grounds.....
What's the difference or the relationship between Ponant and Swoop?
Kara I totally agree with the working out to get more hungry! Amazing video guys! Can’t wait for more!!!
How much?
You guys need to travel to Barrow Alaska it is the most northern point in the United States. They have polar bears there. My sister lived there for a few months while working at the hospital. In the Winter they have no sunlight and in the summer they have there long days of the sun.
French fries on a french ship who would have thunk it.🤣
It’s funny how the titanic crashed while going threw ice and now we just bust threw it
Would like to do this !
Yep, Kara more energy burned usually means more energy needed to burn it so eating more from exercising is a fairly normal experience.
Would never go to such a horrible place.
42 knots = 48.33289 MILES PER HR. WIND
It made my day when both ships were excited to see each other. Initially I thought there would be political squabbling but nope! Just goes to show that there is more to unite us than divide us...plus how actions of a few don't reflect everyone!
Super video again! Fun, yummy, new routine onboard, wind walking, waving at the passing vessel is grand!! and scenery!
I follow another YouTuber/Instagrammer who was on that other ship. He posted some highlights on his Instagram but not the whole video yet. Adding this cruise to my bucket list as well as turning off internet for 16 days and just doing nothing.
The Rock was born in Florida, I believe,  But his nationality is Samoan/Pacific Islander and Black/African American :D
That was SOOOOOO COOOOOOL!
“Where is the rock from?” 😂 I love this video.
What is the "Nature" clip you added in here? Can we watch it on YouTube?
I know that you don't want to show any kind of politics views in your videos but that can be achieved by showing a lot less enthusiasm at the sight of a Russian ship called Rosatomflot. Very disappointing especially for your Ukrainian subscribers. I think you owe those who did not unsubscribe some apologies.
You do need to lose that hat Nate!
I just have one thing to say. Nate is one of the luckiest men on the face of the Earth. Not only does he get to travel the globe (literally), but, he gets to travel with a funny, vibrant, and beautiful person like Kara.
SANTA, IS THAT YOU?
The wind??? Those are the elves
You guys are amazing thank you for sharing this with me this is a place I'll never get to go so seeing this with you guys through your perspective means so much to me not only this traveling adventure but all the other ones :-) I've been a subscriber to your channel for a few months now and I am totally addicted. Love you guys thanks again can't wait for the next video
It was Nate’s snowball fight laughter for me
LOVE the meeting of the ships & pure joy of the passengers :)
Kara,  I am a yoga teacher and I never ever and will never step on my yoga mat with shoes on.  Great video!
Loving these guys more and more, and I started watching when they hadn't even visited 100 countries (they were well below 1 mil subs at that point, like maybe 250k and I would wonder how they could afford what they are doing). This video might be the first where they just let go and be themselves. Which honestly, was nice to see. You get hints of that in other videos, but this might be the first one where they didn't play up to the camera and were just themselves and I loved that. (also love Kara's hair.) dumbest thing I remember from years ago, think it is 13 months. Looking up now to see if I am right. It was 8 months, so even I was wrong - lol.
This would be absolutely incredible that’s something you’ll never forget awesome video guys.
The snow ball fight might be my most favorite thing I’ve seen you guys do 😆 😆 ❄️
Jesus, Nate is at my high school peak. Use to run for an hour with the treadmill set to 7 MPH. But that was in high school. He is a beast to still be doing that.
This looks like an amazing cruise.  Love your schedule on board…breakfast, workout, lunch, spa, afternoon nap!😀  Love how you go to the juice bar after each work out, just because you can! I would do the same!  I also love your workout shoes.☺️ May I ask the brand name? Would love to get a pair like that, they look super comfy and cool!  Thanks for sharing this amazing adventure! You two look like you have a lot of fun.
Good luck finding Dijon mustard from Dijon France. Apparently there's a shortage. Because this is 2022, so of course there is.
Loving this series
Not sure exactly why, but this is my favorite series from y’all.  Totally loving it! 😌😌
Im loving this series, you two are so adorable. I loved the part when the Russians came and stopped by to say hello. Hilarious and perfect, Kara you are such an empathic sweetheart. Much love to you both.
At first I was like "Oh this seems like a great vacation!" and then I looked at the price tag and its $30k+. Cool to watch, but something 99% of your followers will never get to do haha.
Are yall the only guests on the ship? 🚢 ⚓
The way the man ran to go get the cap from the oil 😭❤️ so sweet oh my gosh
I need to know. For people prone to motion sickness would you not recommend this cruise?
It’s not an argument.😂 It is an academic conversation or Socratic discussion.
To be on a cruise like that & NOT partake of all of it's offerings would be silly! Eat, enjoy, work out, walk outside in the cold to burn calories & get back to your normal routine when you're back home! No problem! 💙💜
Nate’s laugh in the cold room!!
I’m so happy these videos are averaging 1,000,000 views per video!
The staff is so cute and wholesome lol
Slava Ukraini, we don't acknowledge the terrible Russian should've sunk their ship if you ask me.
The Rock is from Hawaii.
I love you guys I hope to have a wife like Kara when I’m older ❤️
Cute lil flat bih
Wait, what? 467k views in 12 hrs for Kara and Nate...  Viral? Kind of for them...  Cheers!
This whole episode was great✌️💜
I love both of you guys but my goodness. I wish I was Kara. Just her personality is so amazing. Her confidence. This is my favorite channel to watch!
Love that the Russians waved hello!! So warm. I love that.
Calories don't count at the North Pole, Nate.  Keep eating those pancakes for breakfast!
Free bar? That cruise had to be about $20,000 for one of you right? It's definitely not free lol, awesome video, I loved it
if u want to see polar bears come to Barrow Alaska winter time.
That ending!  Wow!
You two kids are living your best life,thank you for sharing it with all of us!!! Cant wait for the next video!!
Approximately $40,000.00 luxury cruise. Incredible!
for sure opening the social media these days is just like the habits for all of us. we just checking and scrolling, knowing life around us. and the tips from you is good i think, to rearrange the place of the app in your phone. gonna try it next.
My flight to Thailand is in March and your videos have helped so much. Blessings
The way the worker rushed to pick up the olive oil cap 🥹🥹🥹
You guys are amazing and An inspiration. I’m actually working 60hour weeks so I can follow in your journey. Such amazing content thank you seriously.
Nate going to try Run a marathon at the North Pole
I love this adventure. It’s my favorite.   That ship passing was amazing. Tears in my eyes.
Love, love, love!!!!!!!!
Love your work but this ship is callous as hell, given the fact how bad climate change is impacting us , rich would do this trip and post they love nature.. 😑
This is freaking awesome!
0:04, 20:02. The ice is melting and we even speed up to that process. Oh well, "life finds a way".
Great video as always, thank you for sharing. I have to ask, what is the retail price of the package that you are enjoying? Trust me everyone wants to know...
When Nate gave Kara the big warm orange jacket that was so cute he went outside without that much covering was so sweet  😄
I truly think this episode was even cooler than the last one! ;-)
Ugh, really disappointed with the weighing in this video. As someone in recovery from disordered eating this was really distracting and unhelpful. I love your videos but this isn’t what I come here to watch :/
"HOW DARE YOU WEAR A HAT AT DINNER??? YOU'RE SO DISGUSTING AND RUDE" get some real problems i beg ... one thing is calmly informing Nate if you thought he was unaware of this rule and another is rudely (ironic, since "rudeness" is what they're calling out) throwing a fit in the comments section
Did you see Santa? 🎅
This cruise is over $100,000 for two people, crazy
Hot and Cold at the same time. How Cool is that. 😁😁 Harriet and Jim. Richmond, Va.
Jesus loves you
I wear my hat always. I don’t take it off when eating.
YES I GET YOU KARA about the only hungry when working out. I'm super active for hours every day and eat a ton. Then i sprained my ankle and was out for 3 weeks, and I struggled to eat half the food id normally eat.
lol Kara’s question about polar bears in harsh weather made me curious.  Based on a quick Google search, polar bears occasionally dig out snow dens for shelter but usually they’re pretty well equipped to just handle the harsh conditions.
We’re you required to wear masks indoors or was it just your preference?
So funny, my Grandmother would never allow hats at the table. No way, so I have continued the tradition.  I am HAPPY  to hear  yall young folks objecting to wearing a cap at the table. Carry on.  Love that ship. I priced that cruise.  Per person. Omgosh. Amazing.
5 parts!?!
!!!!
I LOVE this series guys. You nailed it so far. 🙌🏼 I’m mean, how cool!!
SOOOOOOOOO, I deff say this about every other video, but this is one of my favoritesssss. I WAS CACKLINGGGGGGG the whole time lol
The Rock is from Hawaii.
Guys we just got back Svalbard and Greenland. We reached  80 degrees latitude on the Scenic Eclipse Crusie.  We are definitly going back to Svalbard and onto the North Pole !!!   Your boat looks amazing... Can't wait to see the POLE
Nate, your hair looks fine. Take the hat off! Lol I can see you guys are having a great time. I'm almost jealous, except I hate being cold! I'll just stay home and watch you!
Fantastic video.
Wind of 48 mph !!!!! I'm from Kansas and Tornado winds and storms hit that and it stinks!!! I can't imagine the wind on top of freezing cold 🥶 !
NATE WALKING THROUGH THE WIND WAS SO FUNNY
LOVE the ship scene!
Mabuhay to my fellow Peenoi seafarers on board the ship :)
Kara and Nate, please inquire about the age of the oldest person on the ship?
I never realized how badly I too *need* to know where The Rock is from until Kara mentioned it.
The wind was so funny!! I love you guys. Too precious.
How do you post without internet
HELLO TO ALL FILIPINOS IN THE SHIP!
$20K cruise for a week
I want more!
Kara, you know how you wondered how they would light up the ship at night? Well, I just told hubby, Wow, in that footage where Nate was on the 9th floor, before fighting the wind, you could actually see the curvature of the earth! I rewind to show him.  He says I think that’s the camera lens dear.  Well, I say, they are almost to the North Pole!  He looks at me.  I then say, oh, I guess any spot on a ball is like any other spot as far as seeing that, huh!? 🤦🏻‍♀️
Holy shiiiiit! I was thinking “free drinks? Everyday? Wow that’s kinda crazy, must cost the cruise line a lot…” and then I looked up how much this cruise was…MINIMUM $32,000 per person…I love seeing these luxurious once in a lifetime experiences but honestly I miss when y’all seemed like normal, nonwealthy people traveling achievably.
Incredible. 💯
Have you guys thought about the fact that Russians are committing genocide on Ukrainians? You have control over your video editing. Use it.
Because wearing a had inside ANYWHERE is just so RUDE!
Loved coming along with y’all for a day on the ship🛳  The spa is incredible and the snow fight had me laughing!! I cannot believe that wind💨 so glad y’all didn’t get blown away!! I was curious if there was many other people on the ship with y’all and I was able to see some throughout the video, especially when the other ship went by, which was so cool👋🏼 What an incredible experience this is!! Thank you for giving me a glimpse into this once in a lifetime trip! Stay you ✌🏼
Also, these videos are definitely a highlight to my week!!!! 😻😻
I LOVE that you guys went to the North Pole! It's my dream and I'm so glad you get to share your incredible experiences with us! Love you both, you beautiful amazing souls!!! 💚💚
My son, 6 years old, said “ they are going to the North Pole!!!”
WOW! Now that looked like an incredible cruise. Definitely different and special. You two are great. Loved the video.
theres probably people on that boat having a bottle of champagne for breakfast everyday, don't feel bad about the pancakes!!!
The ships passing each other was great 😃 Nate and Kara's snowball fight was fun.
Great video as always. 11 minutes in please don’t wear that Theranos collar.
Did y’all meet any other people on the ship?  Sometimes it seems like you’re the only two on the ship
8:40, wow 👌, rub it in. You guys are having fun.  I am enjoying it as well. I would love to experience that.
Tell me you all have gloves 🧤? I’m sure you need fingers for the cameras, but haven’t seen one glove or mitten yet!
Brrrr feel frozen to the bone watching you in the decks lol but what amazing stuff so far!!!
Another great video!  How do you guys afford to travel so much?  Seriously, you are so very lucky, I would love to travel like this!
I was having such a bad day today, but this has helped me so much to change my mood. You guys are awesome. I think of all the places you have gone; this is my favorite. Thank You:0)
The Rock is from Hayward, California.
Hayward California
people are so serious like its a hat and everyones saying "did you ever learn manners" girl chill.
another Great Adventure! Love it!!
Looks like the Captain tries to avoid ice as much as possible! 🤗🤗🤗
Loved the snowball fight the trip looks like a lot of fun and relaxing too!
I don’t normally comment on videos, but this was outstanding! I am definitely going to look into this trip. Can’t wait to see your next video.
Hi Kara and Nate! I'm 15 years old and just recently stumbled across your channel! I can't stop watching you guys! I love the content you post and appreciate the amount of thought and effort you put in each upload! Continue the good work! Have fun at the North Pole!
Love this!
The “it’s a video” part made me LOL
Sooo beautiful y’all did it big on this one, long way from the no Ferris wheel for Kara days jk
your videos just hit the spot every time ahh!! love it
I love how you guys can go on these amazing adventures all the time. (Side note- I thought the wind was a human screaming - lol)
please bring back bloopers! i loved them
You both are like a kid in a candy store, I am so happy to be sharing the adventure with you all. Looking forward to part3
Great video.   Kara rock’n the flip flops at the North Pole….classic.
Kara now has my curiosity about the Rock . Ugh!
It's a French ship!  Of course there are French fries!
How do you deal with motion sickness being on a ship for so long?
It has to feel so weird to travel on some of these trips like this and without doubt be the poorest guests on the boat, its something im sure you guys have to laugh about sometimes, because it really is so cool the opportunities you guys have had via youtube. This is not a jab at you guys, you guys have absolutely killed it! But the tax bracket that can afford this trip is multi multi millionaires, and to mingle amongst that crowd has to feel like a great sense of accomplishment and a little humorous at the same time!
Awesome video. I loved when you bleeped out when you were talking about Nate. It’s like you were calling home bad names 😂. It is just so awesome of an experience. Can’t wait to watch the rest of your videos in this series
Wish Norway would capture the other icebreaker an impound it. #standwithukraine
Magnetic or geographic north pole?
Luved this video. Highlight was the two ships passing. That was amazing 💜🥰
11:19 is my favourite part. Nate trying to find Kara and the door swinging open as well as HIS FACE when he finally gets in. I WAS DYING😂
What are the chances that someone on the other ship was vlogging and they filmed you guys? That'd be amazing.
The extra *oomph* in the editing is 🤌🏽
I just absolutely love watching you guys!! Always cheers me up watching all the incredible things y’all do. Not to mention how amazing you both are, so upbeat and fun! Thanks for sharing your adventures with everyone!❤️  ps, hello from Arkansas 👋 your Tennessee neighbor😊
The meeting of the ships was literally MAGICAL! Incredible!
You guys oh my gosh!!!! What a great video. Seeing that Russian Ship!!!!!! It was seriously awesome. Brought tears to my eyes. Can’t wait to see the next one. Have fun. <3
Why did the two boats meeting make me tear up
I love Kara & Nate so much.  But...:)  When you read about the early explorers of the North Pole like Ernest Shackleton and others that risked their lives and many who died, it seems off that they are in those same waters living in luxury.  Read the book Endurance and you'll see what I mean.
Not many people on board eh?
i think yours is the better/nicer ship than the russian one
$38,000 cruise
I hope you guys are wearing sunscreen everyday, knowing how much you're usually in the sun and Nate's cancer scare. Just from watching videos I am concerned that you both have far too much sun damage already on your faces for your age.
I noticed that a lot of the cruise staff are Filipinos!! ✨😀
GPS pic would be cool !
Hi guys! Does Kara have any ballet or gymnastics background? That's some impressive flexibility!!!
Might be a dumb question LOL but i thought trees provide us oxygen so if there are no trees around, how are y’all breathing?
I mean... not for nothing but this is a cruise for the 1%, for those wondering its like $25k per person....just sayin...
The Rocks from the North Pole... he's a mystical creature..
Dinner while watching Kara and Nate!!! Loving this series already!
Oh my gosh you guys are so awesome sharing this adventure with all of us.
I love you guys please tock with me so i can go with you in this ship. 💔
Hi from Canada, 0 degree -12 wind chill, lolll cute!!
❤️❤️
8:20 in video
6 weeks Prego? Indentions in stomach and hip bones?! 😊
Watching this during a heat wave 😆
an indoor snowball fight sounds amazing
I cannot believe you visited many countries but Iran 🇮🇷 is not on your list. It is much safer than you can imagine, every foreigner who visited the country could not believe the degree of hospitality and safety. Just search on youtube Peter Santanello and his advice.
To my grandmother, you might as WELL have walked in naked as to have your hat on at the dinner table!
I love Nate's mispronunciation of words: 'expresso' instead of espresso and 'in route' instead of en route 😝
my new dream vacation
Me a Canadian watching this series: looks like a normal winter day in Alberta 😂
Just looked up the north pole cruses....37 to 41,000 ??? Not for your average joe !!!! Holy crap
Of course Kara had to be in a bikini in the thumbnail to get those views...
Woah that wind😂😂
I would love to take this trip!  My wife would not. 😞
This is what I used to wish the Travel Channel like when I was a kid:)
Filipino crew? hello to all our Kabayans!! :D
i’m so worried if they saying oh one of the last episode😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
At approx 19:00: To answer those questions, Kara, isn’t there a library on board? A librarian?
Loved the interaction between the two boats. We are social beings, let's keep it that way, shall we?.
Episode number 2 was fantastic guys! The life on board is not boring, that floating city is wonderful  ! Looking forward to episode number 3!
This looks so amazing! I was definitely thinking I need to start planning for this trip in the next few years then i looked at the price tag and i was like nopeee maybe in 10-20 years 🤣🤣
I can't help this, lol.  Dijon mustard actually comes from Canada, hahaha.  The seeds are shipped to france where they finish the mustard.  I'm sorry, I just really couldn't help myself.  I love you guys and this looks like an amazing trip.  Hi from Calgary
Genuinely curious how bad breaking ice with a ship like this (or uneeded) it is for the environment? This can’t be good.. respectfully.
Astonishing!!!
You guys have been so funny on this trip, I have laughed so hard at this series!   Also can totally relate to having no internet and having a million random questions. When we had no Wi-Fi in Europe, one of the questions I wrote down to look up was “where is Abraham Lincoln from” 🤣🤣  who knew I googled so many weird things throughout the day.
Feeling like your core temperature is hot sounds like the first symptom of hypothermia!
Have no doubt. You both deserve every second. Thanks for all the joy xx
I love your videos but the insanity of the masks makes me almost unable to watch them. It’s so evident that the powers that be are trying to control the masses with stupid facial diapers that do nothing except make you look like you are kowtowing to powers that want to control and destroy us.
Love love love this, looking forward to the next one.
Am I blind? Since when did Kara get a nose piercing?
glad your having a great time looks fun blessings sent .stay safe  dear familylove the snowball fight so cool
:-)
Amazing!! Thank you for sharing!! Great filming and video! Loved the encounter with the other ship! Yours looks amazing and so does the food! Loved the bit in the spa cold room… su a fun snow ball fight!! Lol
It's amazing how it seems like you have the entire boat to yourselves, esp. out on the decks. Didn't anyone else come to experience the outside, too? P.S. Nate you've got great hair. Show it off while you can. No indoor hats required. Ha.
I saw the ad on my FB about the boat you are on, it looked amazing and now I am watching you on it, it makes me wanna go on this cruise too and I seriously don't like cruises generally 😅 This trip looks amazing!!!
Maybe because of when I was born, I actually miss the wall phone and in a car, I turn my phone off.  I play mostly solitaire not needing WI-fi.
😘🎈
I was 156 lbs in primary school
My dad went to the North Pole about 8 years ago on that same Russian ice breaker. He was in his 80s. He would be so envious of your ship. But his experience was once in a lifetime, amazing. They had a party on the ice and even a hot air balloon.  He has some great pictures. Can't wait to see yours. Enjoy every moment.
I hate to break it to you Kara and Nate but literally nobody gives a rats ass about the sponsors
Kara, how do you still so fit with all the traveling? What are your habits for fitness while living life on the road?
OH MY GOD PEOPLE LEAVE NATE THE HELL ALONE!!!! Let the man wear a fucking baseball cap on a cruise ship Jesus!!!! Haters.
You should put your Fairdrop logo on your computer to cover the computer logo
maybe there's no polar bears because you're breaking all their ice
dude pimping his wife out
I love you both but 24 hours from North Pole and should be all five six seven year ice what I'm seeing right now is maybe one or two your ice that's not good Open water this time of year is not good
Did you guys clean the olive oil bottle stopper before putting it back on after dropping it coz if you guys didn't i think it is kinda unhygienic
When are y'all having kids? How much fun do you need? life is more.
Strong thumbnail game
A climate change talking point is about the ice breaking off the North Pole.  Cannot imagine plowing a ship through the ice to the 90° parallel helps keep the polar ice solid...
Amazing trip, guys!
THIS would be a once in a lifetime experience. Lucky you!
6:10 You guys are funny. Definetely discovering a lot of French things, huh? Come to France, then, will you? French class all over that ship.
OMG Nate saying all the replys when he wore the hat cracked me up. Then I started laughing remembering how many people were furious with him when he didn't take Kara on that Ferris Wheel years ago. 🤣🤣🤣🤣  WE LOVE YOU NATE!!
Well that looks like a super cool cruise that I would like, but unfortunately the ship looks like it's way below maximum capacity. I see very few other passengers.  So I'm thinking it's like a 20K trip.  Yea sorry love to do that but I don't think I could afford it reasonably.  You guys should mention what it would cost for someone without travel benefits, club cards, sponsorship, youtube bene's whatever else you  get.  I mean like just a normal person booking the trip.  Would like to hear what it would cost an everyday person that doesnt have a lot of travel benefits.  I'm guessing not affordable for your average person.
WTF? NO Internet?!?! Why not STARLINK?!?!?
80% of the crew on that ship are Filipinos!!! Wow!
What happend to the van life
*Dwayne The Rock Johnson was born in calofornia*
Those water shots are amazing!!
You guys are goof balls I love it…..always a laugh from you two
#KARAANDNATE HAD YOU REALLY ANNOUNCED MY NAME TO HAVE A IPHONE13?? I GOT THAT MESSAGE AND NOW ITS DEALING WITH SHIPPING COSTS?
When you two kids get to the North Pole I hope somebody has set up a Santa's workshop and house just for you.  I will give it a standing ovation even though I live alone:)  Absolutely loved when Nate said I'm sorry for this and hit Kara with a snow ball.  Kara just remember when he says sorry for this DUCK and grab snow.
Aaaw, isn't it sweet that the highlight of this video is seeing other humans.  What sweeties.
This is one of a few videos i wish i could like more than once.
Thank you, you make me happy and laugh!
I totally relate with you Kara! The best part of working out often and consistently is getting to eat more🤙🏼💪🏼🌯🥙
What cruise line is this? My husband and I would love to do this trip.
Contrary to popular belief, polar bears this time of year can be found on or near land to hunt seals and fish. If you really want to get close encounter with these magnificent beasts, I would suggest a trip to Churchill, Canada.
It's not about wearing a cap...it;s about wearing it like a white boy !!! Beal forward !!!!
Nate running to the camera saying "don't fall in the ocean" was the cutest thing ever.! Lol Don't know how to describe it but he looked like a toddler happily running to someone special.
I think a trip like this is now on my bucket list
lol that timing on the "wow we're breaking ice" while nate pulled his chair in looked like he shook the boat
Kara, I relate so hard to working out to eat! I share this motivation!
North Poley... lol
We searched the price of this trip, we can't do it. How are you financing this trip? Please share if you want of course.
My favorite part is the snow ball fight between you and Nate. Thank you for putting a smile on my face in each video! I love to travel with you guys. 💛
The hat comments on a cruise... those people can suck one 🤣🤣
Re: not being able to google something - my husband and I stayed at an apartment in San Sebastián that had no internet (and this was before smart phones). There was a complete Encyclopedia Brittanica in the apartment.  We spent a whole night looking up our random questions in the encyclopedia!!
What a goal!!! Top 'O the World! Good for you and great for your viewers to get to "see" this with our favorite YT channel videographers, editors, just plain outstanding presenters, and so much fun!!
Was the staff member who gave you the menu and wine during dinner  Filipino? :)
I totally laughed my ass off at the snowball fight, i actually snorted!
I had the habit of checking my phone for notifications while on a deployment in the navy, even after like 60+ days you still do it, I couldn't break the habit lol.
Love this adventure!!!!!
Nate - life is short, eat pancakes!
Was watching this video (watch all your videos)... paused it to do something. The spot I happened to pause it at looks like a professionally shot/posed ad for winter wear. See 16:10. Seriously. That's award winning marketing for parkas. :)
Not wanna complain, I love your videos and you two seems to be wonderful person's, but hello, 34400 USD for the cheapest ticket on your cruise ship? That's insane, I understand why they offer so much "free", they have already got payed for it normally 🙂👍 Continue to enjoy your travel, gonna watch all your episodes, very interesting
How adorable!!  I love how giddy Nate got with the snowball fight and coming inside from the strong winds. I love watching Kara and Nate because they have a love for one another,  for other people, and for life that is so wholesome. Their energy and joy comes through the tv and I feel uplifted by them just being themselves.  It is rare for me to see in myself and the people around me this kind of passion for life.  I have been watching since video 1 and I am an all-in fan!
You’re snowball fight is the most wholesome content 😊😊
I've always wanted to go on the 50 Years of Victory. Such a cool ship!
I love how Keira is so happy that the other people were smiling and laughing and having a great time she is so empathetic and so selfless I absolutely love you Kearny and I hope you guys keep on making the contact that you’re making and affecting other people in a great way! Btw that trip looks sooooooooooo fun😁😁😃🤩😃🤩😃!
Full of sh**t
Comment
Kara, I absolutely love you! You seem like such a genuine person and I love how positive you are in every situation. You and Nate are both really cool people.... But Kara is just an inspiration to other women!!! Love both y'all! Keep making videos 😊❤️
Awesome!
How do you post on YouTube without internet
Kara:  "North Polie weather"...lol !   Loved that last horn blast by the Russian ship...it was kind of a tearful feeling.
Omg I'm so happy you guys are having a wonderful time and I'm glad you are on the right ship☺🎉🎉🎉
Don't know why. Seeing the other ship brought tear to my eyes
Wow really people commented about you wearing a hat on the boat? That just makes me want to take a cruse just to wear my hat the whole time and piss stupid people off. If you get upset about someone wearing a hat inside you got problems.
Really enjoyed this!!! 💜
why do you guys cover your apple logos on your macs?
I'm just loving the amazing vibe that Kara and have.  Living vicariously through the two of you is amazing.  Thanks for including us on your wonderful travels.  Stay safe and have the time of your lives.
I’ve been watching you guys for a year and I love you so much!!! I have the same coffee addiction as Kara!! ☕️ I hope I can travel the world like you guys some day!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This seems like such a fun trip
The day you posted this we got introduced to the titanic unit
Love the videos glad you share thank you
Ithink this is the endfor me, You hve now become elitists. Sorry not interested in wht the 15 can afford,Godbye but not goodluck
The mustard thing made me laught, but it's not that shocking that you dont know it, it's just like champain a lot of people don't know that it as to come from the Champagne region otherwise they're not allowed to call it champain
How you could resist getting butt naked and flashing the Russians since you had your own balcony is beyond me.
This might be a dumb question, but how do they avoid hitting animals on the ice
I'm just loving these videos so far! Best series yet!
It’s like watching Discovery Channel but free
Omg if you stop in alaska (anchorage area) we would absolutely love to take you fly fishing or something!!
How many cabins on your ship and how many passengers on this voyage? The ship seems empty.
thank you, this is amazing to watch
Very much relate to working out more to build up a larger appetite so I can eat more!!! I’ve never been one to over eat, so when I tell you the sadness I get when I pass up an amazing looking meal because I’m simply not hungry 🥲
I want to marry this couple.
Great a again!
This is honestly the best part of my day especially when I get home from school. I feel like I am there with you💕
What does she mean when she says Nate’s channel?
I want to go to the kids so badly
Every time we see you both walking away, I think to myself, ‘now somebody has to go back for the camera…. That’s a lot of work…’
That was so nice kara said she was connected with people on another ship.😌😌😌
At $45,000  at a starting point you should definitely eat as much as you can …. And drink…. And work out ….and be given your own personal seal to hang out with on your deck.
Next video: Nate gets plastered trying all the alcoholic bevvies challenge 😂
Kara looks way older than Nate.. but considering he acts like a child maybe that helps make her look older!
It’s not a disagreement. It’s the search for truth.
Man…it’s wild that two people I absolutely had classes with at the University of Tennessee are world famous…be nice to all your classmates. Never know who’s gonna make it big.
I agree wit Kara, I workout to eat more on vacations. Makes u feel better at the end
I just looked up, and realized that The Rock was born in CA. I thought he was born in Hawaii. His mother is Samoan. So I thought he grew up in Hawaii.
I love remembering that it's Wednesday. It means Kara and Nate day. I love you guys. You give me a smile when I need it. Have fun.
Kara when she gets internet: “where is the rock from?” 🤣🤣
I love that neature video!!!
It's nice to know you understand wearing your hat at while dining is considered bad manners. My father would have made you eave the table.  LOL
That was a awesome video thanks for sharing ☕️ ☕️ ☕️ ☕️ 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👍👍👍❤️🥰🚢🛳🌎
Nobody is talking about how this cruise costs $40k per person.   I presume K&N get a deal for promoting it :).  Looks like another trip of a lifetime!   You’ve had so many
Been a subscriber for ever - I loved your videos from Antarctica.  I was stationed there for one year while I was in the Navy at McMurdo Station.  Now you are heading to the North Pole.  I was over the North Pole on numerous occasions while I was in the Navy on a nuclear submarine.
The video quality is amazing!! Did you guys get a new lens??? I would like to buy 😍
Omg the Russian cruisers saying « Bon voyage » ( safe travels in French ) at the end, I died 🥰
Loving this series! Can'twait for the next episode! I never want your videos to end.
I think Nate is trying to run to the North Pole and possibly back... because that's just something Nate would do..
Aw! That’s how I felt when I saw the Canadian ship at Niagara Falls lol 😂
I was cold just watching this.
21:36 *episode
You guys are amazing. Love how humbled you both are for these absolutely amazing experiences and bringing us all along. Kara coming in from the very very windy outside with her hair in her face made me laugh out loud. 🤣
Where did you get that black dress/jomper from? Its beautiful
Aha! Neature walk!
The snowball fight omg LOL
A trip of a lifetime 💕
Your spa time is my favorite thing too!
Wait… it’s only -12c with wind chill… dang that’s seems warmer than I expected
considering the tension between Russia and many other parts of the world its nice to see that the tension doesn't extend to curse ships. this is such an awesome video series to watch
I laugh so hard every time you guys mention Polar bears I don't think you'll find them while at sea you have a better chance if you where in Svalbard before you left hehe
Yes, Kara, I relate. I do the same thing lol
V Bro can relate ever since I started sorting out I'm always HUNGRY
the rock is from Hayward,CA
When Kara was talking about reading and said, “It blows my mind,” my 9-year-old daughter said, “Of course it blows your mind, it’s so windy out there.” I just thought it was hilarious 😂 Also great tips about rearranging apps!
I love Kara reaction on the patio when the boat passed,just something about it, the pure raw reaction when you open the sliding door
I wish I could give a double thumbs up! This is the coolest experience I’ve ever watched. Between the luxury and the uniqueness of the arctic surroundings, weather. Just so happy for you two for getting to share this and thank you for sharing it with us!
This can’t be good for the environment
Imagine growing up without the Internet Kara.
I was panicked for you in the snow room!
Hey, I’ve been following you guys for a few years and I really enjoy your videos. I just wanted to let you know that as a person recovering from an eating disorder, your comments about needing to “earn” your food and “work off” your food etc are very triggering. You’ve made similar comments in many of the videos that I have seen. I know I’m not the only one who feels this way so on the off chance that you see this comment, I just wanted to let you know. Thanks for all your content. I love living vicariously through your adventures.
What do you mean there is no land at the North Pole?  Where does 🎅🏾 and the elves live?
Goku solos
Loving this series plus the little clips of the nature boy and the office in this video made me laugh so much 🤣 Can’t wait to see the rest of the North Pole videos!❤️
In case you haven’t figured it out yet, geographic North Pole is the physical point on earth at North 90 degrees; Magnetic North is an imaginary point. The earth’s magnetic pole shifts every so often and so magnetic pole changes it’s location as well. Since magnetic north (and therefore also magnetic south) is the only thing we could measure reasonably, navigators uses magnetic north as the reference, and depending on where in the world they are at, correct for the magnetic declination (variation), which will derive to geographic north 😁 hope this make some sense
What kind of ship is that, that it doesn't have Starlink? 🧐
Did you meet any fun people on board?!
Nate there was no choice...the ship you are on totally! What an amazing adventure! Love the colors of ice in the water. Kara you are so flexible keep that!
I honestly love the the cruises to the colder climate places.
What a wonderful adventure you both are having
So reminds me of the Titanic when Nate mentioned take the New one over the other and everyone's standing👋👋👋
How many people are on the ship?
Absolutely love your videos and you’re personalities crack me up. Awesome content yaw! Safe travels
Kara I think there is most likely some Russians and American sailors a few hundred feet below you as well not just the two ships passing in the night. 😂
I hope someday I find my soulmate to travel the world with🙏🏻🌎🤍
Please tell me yall tried the pool outside!! Lol
Wow!! What an awesome cruse, I didn’t know something like that existed. 🧡🧡🚐💨🪶🦦
Hey! I teach Navigation - among other things - and here is the difference between magnetic North Pole and geographic North Pole! The geographic North Pole is just that. The very top of the earth. In latitude and longitude it is 90 degrees north latitude. The geographic center of the northern hemisphere. Longitude lines all meet at the Geographic North Pole (and at the geographic South Pole) The Magnetic North Pole is where compasses point, (it is currently located at 86.50°N and 164.04°E ) which is off set (and always moving a little) from the geographic North Pole. So the earth, is actually a big ball with an iron core, like a bar magnet. That bar magnet is floating in liquid rock. A compass points to the north end of the bar magnet. The difference between magnetic north and geographic north is called declination or magnetic variation. And we need to account for it when doing navigation.
love love love this vlog I can say it make us feel like we are there with y'all. I love the part of y'all playing in the snow so cool and so much fun.. passing the other boat make my heart happy.. everyone seem so happy to see everyone else <3
Wow, just amazing
I write down random questions too when I need to goggle it later 😂
The crew member in me is living for the cringy moments of my fellow seamen 😂 “it’s a video” that killed me 🤣 but also it’s so cool to see cruising from a guest perspective. My first ship was an ice breaker. And I totally relate the the inconsistent treadmill runs on a small ship with the rocking.  But I don’t know, I did two trans crosses and the longest we were on land was for 6 days, not to mention my COVID quarentine which was 21 days…. Glad you had fun but I don’t know how you managed to keep busy! I would be dying of boredom 😅
I think if y’all can go to the North Pole, y’all can come to Alaska. 😍 I would suggest the Mt. Marathon race in Seward on the 4th of July. Thanks for sharing your adventures and for being great people and examples that I can share with my daughter.
Russian ship!
Omg it was AMAZING to hear y’all laugh together in the snow room!!!
My mother would turn over in her grave if she saw you at dinner with a hat on.  I think that rule is a bit dated.    Snowball fight was aawesome
42 knots equals to 48.333 miles per hr
The Rock is form Hawaii
Your Alaska cruise was the first video I had ever watched of your guys 🥲
Brilliant!
I know you guys said you don’t want to be on your phones, but watching you guys is so fun! How do you come up with your crazy adventures? By research or recommendations?
If I ever win the lottery I'm taking this trip.
DEE - JOHN not dijon 🤣🤣🤣
Great video
Love this series! Always love your energy, enthusiasm, and positivity.
I love this series! ❤️
Enjoying this series. Thanks y’all
Kara: "Merci" Chef (who is noticeably french): "You're welcome"  🤠
That one guy In school who were’s shorts no matter who what when where why on this boat
He just went running hahaha
I am loving every second of this trip!
Roll ice cream
I was wheezing when Kara had to grab the door to come Inside from the crazy wind😭😭
What a cool adventure! Y’all should watch the North Pole episodes of Big Bang Theory and compare it to your experience 😂
I definitely want to go to the north pole and to Antarctica, south pole.
When Nate said "42 knots of wind" all I heard in my head was Riley's voice saying "iT's A SquALL!!!!!!" 😆😆😆😆
Working out uses energy food is energy. Everyone knows how you feel like, literally everyone who works out feels hungrier after working out then not doing anything 🤦🏼‍♂️
guys I love what you do.... but is this filmed in Aug 2022... after Russia's invasion of Ukraine?      if it is then I am so amazed that there are some of Russia's population who are still behaving as citizens of the world... or is this way before Feb 2022
Fun video. Great that you are able to kick back and relax.
Idk why but I felt so emotional when you saw the other ship!
This is my dream!! I absolutely LOVE y’all’s videos. A North Pole cruise is amazing! Love your videos! XOXO Annie <3
Kara, please can you narrate more than Nate.
The only way to have a sauna on a boat is to burn diesel fuel to run the generators.
I loved the part where the other IceBreaker goes by and everyone is screaming there lungs out, weirdly and beautifully heartwarming. Also the part where y’all are in the Snow Room was cool that was the least expected thing on the ship, y’all looked so happy to be on this Trip. So far #1 thing on my bucket list! Love you guys can’t wait for Part 3!!
Are there others on this trip? Looks amazing
The hat in the restaurant was a funny point...I LOVE THIS ADVENTURE!!!
Kara, I totally get what you are saying about working out so you can eat more.  It's not that you are concerned with gaining weight, it's just expending energy makes you more hungry.  And with great food choices such as the ones you are being presented with, I also would want to go to the breakfast/lunch/and dinner table as hungry as possible!
I just priced out this trip.....Yep, you managed to make the Antarctic look cheap. After my wife watched your videos on Tahiti, I had to push back my retirement by a year, if she catches this series, i'm never retiring.....
What a great surprise at the end seeing the other ship. That was awesome
The cruise ship part looks like fun, but i already live in Winnipeg so i freeze my ass off enough every winter and i'm not sure going to the north pole would be much different xD.
You could have at least said 'Putin, stop the war in Ukraine!" to the Russians!
Screw the people who gave you shit for wearing a cap to diner! I asked for simple clarification a few weeks ago about what kind of foot wear for one particular restaurant on a cruise I'm going on next month and I got so much crap about the rest of the dress code even though I didn't ask about that! God damn there were a bunch of asses!! I don't get why it bothers people so much.
My favorite Kara quotes this vid: Ya, we’re just goal setters.” and “This is definitely the most north poley weather yet.” 😆👌🏽🫶🏻
Kara!!! That’s totally me… i workout because I want to eat. So… 😆😜
Where are the other passengers so few?
its crazy how you guys are literally wearing parkas and where i am from we are waering summer dresses and shorts lol have fun on your adventure
You have eaten at some really cool places, but I have to know where have you had the best food of your life?
Kara and Nate u truly helped me this week. My husband and I were hiking up a steep mountain in Italy with out teen kids and I found it so hard,  but I kept thinking about u guys. First all the physical challenges that Kera dose that is out of her comfort zone and second when nate says u can to almost anything for ten minutes.  I made it up the mountain and the view was beautiful.  Thanks for being so inspiring 💜 looks like u r haveing a great time 👌🏻
no cuz i already cannot wait for the next episode !!! i’m loving this series so much, i kinda get to see all of this through your eyes :))
its crazy how you guys are literally wearing parkas and where i am from we are waering summer dresses and shorts lol have fun on your adventure
love me a good kara and nate series!
I've introduced my sister to yall's channel and she has fallen in love with you two.   She and Kara have so many similarities its wild!
WOW NATURE!  Kara’s quote of the month😂
This is one of the best posts you guys have ever made! The snowball fight had me belly laughing 🤣
Nate chucking snow at Kara and her trying to kick it away was too funny 🤣
“I’m really sorry for this”.    Right.
The onboard snowball fight was very cool. The best part would be seeing the only other ship to the North Pole is awesome. Safe travels.
It would be interesting to see what you both packed for North Pole. :)
When the ship starts listing towards your berth you’ll know you’ve gained weight.
Really enjoying this series! I was wondering how many guests are on the cruise?
you two should go to Churchill Manitoba its the polar bear capital of the world
Still aaaamazing!!!!
That other ship sent so much love to you guys it made me tear up lol.  Not sure why but that was an emotional meet on top of the world. Much love.
Hello Kara and Nate! I’m a new subscriber from Toronto area and binge watching your videos. Very entertaining and easy to watch 4 hours of videos in one sitting. This was a great episode as well as the Antarctic episode. Very very good productions. Btw, what kind of camera do you record with? I’m curious as o record my two bulldogs but need a much better care. Take care, God bless.
Love your videos and so glad to see your having a nice time on your next adventure, but I can’t help but wonder the impact this has on the environment, global warming and Ice caps which are already melting. If anyone could shed some light on this i would appreciate it. Thanks
I love this so much! You guys are seriously on fire this year can’t wait for the next video🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶
Here's a great explanation of magnetic north versus true north. Oh yeah, for when you get back. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD6bPNZRRbQ&t=919s (Start watching at 8:30 for the physics lesson)
I’m 100% uninterested in cruising until these moronic mask and vaccine rules go away. Ruins the freedom feeling of a cruise.
Why did I search where Is “the rock” from too its literally still in my safari
🎶Swoop there it is…swoop there it is…🎶 The maestros of polar expeditions them Swoopsters! The Swooperonis! The Swoopy McSwoopertons!!! The McSwoopilations!!!!! I could go ALL day with the Swooptacular names but Swoop there it is is the beat I’m hummin’. 🤓
Dam I love you guys your so genuine that snowball fight though lol
It's always a great thing to agree to disagree with your significant other. Thats what life is all about... discovery of each other and how to relate to each other :-) Great stuff Kara and Nate!
When you're on a $60K cruise, and you think the juice-bar is free🤣🤣
Doesn’t anybody find it ironic that this trip is possible because of polar ice melting and they’re on a ship also helping that ice melt faster?
Y'all this is what true love looks like I swear 😍😍😍
How much the full tour cost in the cruise?May i know plz?i love ur vlogs so much..keep spread happiness u both are doing so well.good luck for ur future trips
Why is there no Wi-Fi?
This is such a DREAM experience, especially since I absolutely love the cold 🥶💙  Why is it 40 000$ 💔💔💔😭😭😭 Thank you guys for letting me live this through your videos❤️!!
You two are just sooo cute.  I love looking at the world through your eyes.... as I'm typing away at my keyboard at work.  Yes, not getting much work done, but it's sooo hot in Boise, ID, my boss is okay with my somewhat slacker-tude.
Say HELLO to Santa when you get there!
What an amazing trip you guys took! Very jealous. I bet the sights, sounds and of course the cuisine was unforgettable. Thanks Kara and Nate for sharing this adventure with all of us 🙂
Kara is very flexible
It’s like omg humans 🤣🤣🤣🤣
💯 on workout to eat!!  🏋🏻‍♀️ 🍔 ✨
All those people complaining about the hat need to get over it. It's a hat. It literally changes nothing. If you want to be miserable, keep it to yourself.
The snow ball fight was the best! 🤣🤣🤣
Now I want to do this cruise! This looks so cool!
Were you freaked out about being SO FAR from land?! You both are amazing... love your sense of adventure and desire to discover new places, people and things!
Kara is so flexible
So, lately, there has been a lot of "this is going to sound spoiled, but...".    At this point in your YT career, you *are* spoiled.  But you have *earned* this status, you deserve it.  Years back, you were lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time, and you were smart and skilled enough to make the most of it. If you were trust fund kids who expected only the finest, you would be so irritating, but that's not you.  You're a young couple from Tennessee with very good hearts, and it seems you appreciate every opportunity that continues to come your way.  Sometimes we in your community get jealous and that's natural too. Please just keep doing your thing, keep feeling gratitude, and the rest of us will keep enjoying all the adventures life has to offer, thanks to you sharing yours. 💛
I wish you would do a video of Longyearbyen as well, home to many of us ❤️
I been to the North Pole but I didn’t take a cruise
Wow that looks so fun. Great video of thr amazing  boat. Thanks for sharing
Is it really £27,000 ? Looks amazing though just wish I had the money
I am watching my dreams I LOVE IT!!!!!
Is there truly no one else on the ship with you aside from staff? I don’t think I’ve seen anyone else. What an adventure!
I can guarantee every one of the people complaining about you wearing a hat are all over the age of 60
Kara, I wanted to say thanks for sharing your weight. I think it goes a long way when influencers share the “normal” parts of their lives. Young girls need to know they don’t have to be size 0 and under 100 lbs to be beautiful. 🥰
Kara give a listen to the podcast Modern Wisdom, the episode with Andrew Huberman. He gives some fascinating insight into why we get addicted to our phones and how to train your brain to stop. Fascinating stuff.
How are they posting then if they have no internet
12:57 Is that Steve Holt!!
You guys never fail to impress. I am sure you won't see this but just wanted to say watching your videos are the most interesting thing I watch all week. Thanks for taking us to this amazing cruise.
How'd you guys sleep on the boat if there is no sunset? :) Does the boat have black outs?
That server ran for the cap when he saw you try to go grab it. Love it
It's nice seeing how neat nature is instead of Lenny and Rodney just knowing it 😂
Tom Scott has a few videos on his trip to the North Pole on the Russian icebreaker, I’d recommend it to anyone :)
It was amazing!!
The rock is from samosa I think
9:39 scared me for a second hahahaha
Did you tell us how much to cruise is?
When you crossed paths with the Russian icebreaker, I started crying.  Our governments are hateful but we, the people, still have love for one another. ❤️ I’ve only been watching for a few months, but this has been my favorite by far! The snowball fight was fantastic. 😂 you two are just so adorable together.
The most hilarios chapter you ever made. Nate is totaly enlightend!! Maybe because you dont have to plan ahead, so you can just live the moment. And so is Kara... I love you two so much❤👍
Kara&Nate ❤️❤️❤️
Kara coming in after that wind was cracking me up 🤣
Too many adds :-( boring :-(
Wait, why is there no Internet. That's one reason I wouldn't book this trip
Kara looked so cozy and comfy prior to her wind excursion...💨🌊🌬.   And at first, when Nate was feeding Kara some dessert, I thought it was the waiter doing it....lmao
Thank you for sharing your adventures with us! I am enjoying your adventures!
19:51 this icebreaker?  https://youtu.be/bKaVhXn49xY at 1:20
how are u guys uploading if you don’t have internet?
Lekker man lekker 🇿🇦
Oh my what fun!!  What a treat to see another icebreaker out there! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, for taking us all along on such a wonderful experience.
The food looks amazing 🤩 idk if I'd so much like the ❄️ cold🥶 though!?!? I'm more of a ....warm sunshine kinda person! Maybe for a three day cruise;)
How many people are on this cruise? Every time at dinner it looks like nobody is around or when you were listening to music it doesn't look like many people are there. But I guess that sounds nice, instead of some of those ship where they pack people in like sardines! lol  Also watching Nate try and walk on the ship with the wind was hilarious! May have gone back and rewatched that a couple times. :)
Way to luxurious for a trip like this. Was expecting to see much more of the Arctic itself, instead of the western lifestyle we all know.
I find it quite decadent to go there with a huge ship just because you can! Apparently you have not heard that just ships have an enormous output of greenhouse gases and the engine noise for the marine life is the purest stress. Think about it!
Great video as always. Enjoying this series of the North Pole and your snow ball fight in the snow room. I also love Surf Shark and have been using it for some time now. keep up the good work.
5:46 that man was like oooooh noooo
Love this series. The comment about the hat vs naked cracked me up Nate! 😂 it never ceases to amaze me the crazy things people say to you guys LOL
Yes Kara!!!! We FEEL YOU on the working out to eat more 🤸‍♀️🍕🥘🥧🍫
I need to know how much this cost!!🤩
I dated a guy in the Coast Guard in Seattle that was stationed on one of their ice breakers.
I get the social media addiction TO AN EXTENT and I do mindlessly click things but... you are a social media influencer, and I want to be a social media person as well, it's kind of mandatory to be on social media a lot.
A complete different taste of sight seeing 😋 but I love 💘 it. Normally people can't see this type of blogs. What a ship! Ice breaking scenes are really fantastic. So much love 💘 from Bangladesh.
If my future marriage doesn't include a snowball fight on a ship going to the North Pole then I don't want it 😂
Lol, we’ve all been there - push don’t pull the door handle. My heart stopped a minute thinking you were stuck in there then I belly laughed. What a great series!!
That moment when Kara and Nate thought they were locked in the snow room before they realized they needed to push not pull the door was priceless.
As the two ships pass each other, isn’t it neat how everyone is peaceful & feels a certain camaraderie!!   I really think most people are just people, just wanting to live & work & enjoy family & friends & neighbors in peace! The way it should be ..
OMG best snow fight ever! I was giggling with ya'll  I think I neeeed to do that cruise!!  Thanks for the great video's you do !!
Episode 3: A deep dive into the Calculator app. 🤣
Thank you Kara and Nate for taking us along on your North Pole Cruise Adventure..... So fun to watch..! The snowball fight was too funny..:)  I request you two have more snow ball fights in the future..:) Safe Journey and may God continue to bless you both..!!
You should sit on a towel when sweating in a sauna. It's actually not hygenic and disgusting sitting in/on someone elses sweat.
maybe wave a few Ukrainian flags at the Russian Ice breaker.
I know it’s likely too late to ask this question, but I think it would be neat to see the staff accommodations & where they hang out, how long they work in a day, is it a contract job, there obviously has to be lots of folks making it happen ! ( Plus I just think everyone should remember,  that every job someone is doing, is an important in some way  ,& no one should ever be devalued!)
top 5 youtube series on the internet!
Great advertising for the ship. Well done guys. God bless you all, both of you and the ship.
1000% resoNATE with that Kara! The worst part of working out on a cruise is actually working out... feeling good about eating the rest of the day is the BEST
Amazing views from sauna
Kara out on the balcony in her bath robe waving like crazy at the Russians wondering what the Russians were yelling back at her.........Покажи нам свои сиськи! Покажи нам свои сиськи!
4:53 sounds like dead souls in a movie lol
Tell me why I wanted to cry when the two ships were passing lol
Curious if breaking the ice is negatively affecting the environment? Will the ice easily fuse back together, is it disrupting the wildlife’s land?
Absolutely love this series ! Giving me Antarctica series vibe ! Love it thank you !
Top notch fun!
Everyone should disconnect once a year for a few days such a breath of fresh air
Looks AMAZING! Love the vid <3 One question- don't you get sea sick?
Viewer 135577
I found out my grandma was about to pass away while I was watching you throw snowballs. I’m adding this to my bucket list. It’s the only thing I keep watching now.
It’s like the titanic but didt hi an ice burg and is going to the North Pole and it’s me fancy
I wouldn't consider pancakes a bad habit lol
When you said exercise builds up your appetite I will have steal that advice.
That's too funny all those people bothered about Nate and his hats. Can we just talk about how that waiter _lunged_ forward to retrieve Kara's olive oil cap? Pro hospitality levels.
the emissions from the cruise are the very reason you weren't seeing any wildlife outside the cruise
The best series EVER!!
I loved the moment when you met the other ship. Because it was Russian. With all the crap that’s going on in the world there were just human people that met in the cold isolation of the North Pole like in outa space... we are all just human beings and long for company when we are isolated. This was so wholesome. We should see beyond nationalities and borders and cherish humanity and strive towards peace for mankind on earth... sigh
They both have amazing fit bodies… I hate this 😂 you’d think since those trips start at like 24k they could get some of that maritime starlink going for internet.
Did any of you suffer with sea sickness on this cruise?
I'm glad you didn't choose the Russian ship considering the war going on :)
No Hat Nate!!!!
Can anyone else appreciate that they have different chapters in every video. I love it.
manche menschen werden auch durch sport nicht attraktiver!
That’s like 50 mph of wind 😂
I am absolutely IN LOVE with your channel <3 These videos are a highlight of my day and bring such a big smile on my face! Keep on enjoying life together <3
Kara in her retainer saying Bonjour was hilarious 😂
03:41 Beautiful beautiful color grade
I can relate to you Kate, on being hungrier when I work out. I noticed a huge change in my apatite at the start of last Lent when I started walking three miles every single day, for health reasons...to loose weight...lol. the irony.
You are incredible and so talented.   Well done!! The videos about  North  Pole are so interesting.
Well did you see Santa
Tell us about your new wedding ring, Kara.
The announcements over the speaker remind me a Frankie so much
42 knots is 48.3327 MPH
I don't know why, but this channel is like my comfort. <3
Kara my thumb (and brain!) does the same thing! I move my apps around so my thumb goes to open youtube and hits a weather app instead, makes me think! Phone addiction is real!
Nate.. Take off your hat when eating :)
I'm so glad I checked to see if you posted this just made my day  ❤
Not gonna lie... having a snowball fight on a cruise is one of the weirdest things I've ever heard of or seen. But it looks like a lot of fun.
New bucket list item: Take a Ponant Cruise.
Kara, you are absolutely not wrong to work out in order to eat more. In fact, you may be the sanest person alive right now.
There seem to be almost no other passengers
$40,000 per person FUCK ME
Wish I could give 100 upvotes for the neature clip
Wow
Really enjoying this series! Great videos guys, enjoy your time in the Arctic
The meeting of these two ships was absolutely heartwarming and shows that such simple circumstances can connect people from all kinds of places who might have more in common than they would have thought. Such an emotional and beautiful, connecting moment <3 <3 <3
I'm not going to lie, I got a little teary eyed as well when the other ship passed. What a wonderful moment of human connection right there. As always, great video!
You people are awesome!! keep it up and safe travels
The wind sounded like someone was screaming 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i just want to now is there internet
I live in a place where I’m just a rain shower we get 45 mph wind on just a normal day the faster wind I’ve ever been is 105 mph
i don't see links to the boat tours on the description
Nate running towards the camera “DONT FALL IN THE OCEAN” had me 😂😂😂
Just googled what a Nautical Mile was! It was a good school day 🚢
Ok I love how when the Russian boat past Kara was in her robe and her big jacket. Not gonna lie I'd do that as well. ♥️♥️
Kara saying "I don't care when we get into North Pole" is such a vibe! Love every episode ❤️❤️❤️
Love so many things about this vid, amazing insight into something most of us will never do...so interesting and cool seeing all the facilities in this almost alternate universe..   But have to say Kara's advice about moving apps on our phones homescreen is so true!!  Defo worthwhile and our dumb thumbs can bring us to other apps or just not at all for a while!!
I am 15 years old 6,0 rugby player and way 72.22 kg I'm so heavy compared to nate
When was this filmed?
You two have the right idea to be on the move. The way this world has become I don't blame you to keep moving in hopes you don't see the chaos that has become so in your face. Your videos have become my escape. Thank you and blessings to you and Nate.
My man is working out hard with daily pancakes lol
Wait this trip costs......$40,000?!?!?!
I love watching these videos. ❤️ I wish I was there with you guys. Thanks for sharing your adventures with us. 😘
Spreads legs wide open “I’m working out so I can eat more” 😉
During the wind scene ..... All the people inside were saying "why are they doing that"  When really you found the fun
As much as I love this video, there is no way I'd be secluded on a ship for that many days.  Now if you were newly married....maybe...lol.
One can only dream, this is a once in a lifetime trip which I would love to do, but, I looked it up, 37'160 US$. I will continue to live vicariously through you guys, looking forward to your arrival at the North Pole.
I hope you guys get to see SANTA!!!!
12:45 Nate turned into Alan Walker ❤️😂
LOL, Nate enjoying (or being scared of) the strong wind made me laugh :D What a great trip!
Kara and Nate I absolutely love your videos!! I am really enjoying this north pole series, can't wait for the next one 💟
Love the snow fight so much.  I was literally laughing out loud!  Can't wait for the next video!  Make memories ;)
I would love to go to the North Pole, What company goes there?
This is Amazing
I love going on these excursions with you!  So refreshing and it definitely brings a smile and sometimes a tear to my eye.  Thank you for your incredible videos and for making me feel like I'm right there with you!
Where is the rock from he is from Hayward calafornia
wait how do they post without wifi
Signed up for fare drop and been get emails for some awesome deals! You guys are truly amazing! I can not wait to start traveling and using fare drop internationally !!!
My nickname on the Peloton is moves4macros. I can totally relate to you Kara. I move to eat. lol
12:45 looks like alan walker :D nobody one the ship ? :P
I wonder if y’all met Cecilia Blomdahl
Uhm y’all are putting way to much eucalyptus in the sauna haha
You two are having the time of your lives I’m loving this trip! I love cruises now this is on my bucket list!
I love how the staff ran like it was is life getting thrown jus to the olive oil cap i love that. 5:48
Think about THAT for a while. 🤯
Looks amazing but holy $$$$$$$ looked up the cost for my husband and I in Canadian, $55,000 each wow. The drinks aren’t really free 😂😂😂 I’m still loving this series but the dream of going there is slightly crushed. Glad you guys are sharing it with us!
I love your philosophy behind working out. It makes me feel like I should just get back to working out. I love food too.
nate got spidey senses
Love this series and the ship is BEAUTIFUL!
Ah this is such an amazing experience! How cool to see another icebreaker so far from everything! AND OMG ALL THE FOOD, that would be my favorite part of the day even though I definitely love a nice toasty sauna haha
Soon!
Kara!! Rocking that bikini in the Arctic 🤣.  You're in fantastic shape and stretching in the gym like it was nothing. I wish I were that flexible.  Nate, hope you don't get trolled again for the hat thing. ❤️
I laughed out loud, with tears in my eyes, at Nate walking in the wind 😂😂
I dream of that energy when u guys was throwing the snow at each other 😂😂
Kara and Nate, I've been subscribed to your channel for years and I really loved watching your videos.  The episode of you tearfully rejoicing over the russian ship is a slap in the face to all Ukrainians, Americans, Brits and all other nations that fight against russia. Too bad you don't realize that all these people on the ship are sponsoring the daily killing of civilians in Ukraine, who are being fired missiles at from russian naval ships.  Which you greet so joyfully in your video.
You guys I love seeing you have so much fun keep enjoying be safe and I’ll look forward to your new video
Часть с ледоколом, самая лучшая!
I've been watching your YouTube channel for years and I still love it so much!! brings me tons of joy and happiness love how you guys come up with new fascinating travel ideas!!
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Dare you to watch Titanic….
Cool video!
Snow ball fight, in a snow room, on a cruise ship, to the north pole... if this is not living, I don't know what is.
WOW I NEED TO GO ON THIS ❤️🔥🤩 you guys are great!!
Yay another episode of north pole experience that want to do on my bucket list
I wish there was more info on whether or not breaking all this ice is ok for the north pole considering how much ice is being lost there. Makes me sad for the polar bears.
NATE TAKE OFF YOUR HAT WHEN EATING AT A RESTAURANT!! SHOW SOME RESPECT TO KATE!! EVEN 14 YEAL OLD BOYS IN TENNESSEE WOULD NEVER DO THAT!!  OMG!!
When I saw you both outside, trying to fight against the wind and snow, I suddenly felt very grateful that you went there in the high summer. 😄😄😄
I can't believe people care THAT much that you wore a hat at the dinner table. Either way, love the video as always!
You guys were NOT alone up there.  I have been to the north pole, magnetic north pole (Yes, I know the difference) and have circumnavigated the globe several times (Yes, we did donuts around the north pole) but there are many submarines up there and they know EXACTLY where you are and they track everything.  We also help with scientific stuff, but our main mission is to keep track of anything that moves.  :)
Aww. The moment Kara was outside in her robe waving to the Russian ship and feeling emotional about the connection to the tourists on that vessel. ❣️ Can't wait for Part 3!
What an amazing adventure to be able to experience!  It would be fun to know some facts about this ice-breaker as you near the North Pole. What’s a typical ice depth as you get closer?  What’s the max depth of ice this boat can break through?  What is the possibility that the boat could actually get stuck in the ice, i.e. an Ernest Shackleton type of scenario?  Do you ever get off the boat to be able to walk on the ice?
I have to admit the food and amenities on this ship looks so good that if I wasn't retired and living on a S.S. check I'd book a cabin immediately.
Is there a time when the ship can’t sail because of ice thickness?
Sauna culture = unknown in the U.S. 😆🤣😂😅 I envy you though. The ship’s amazing.
Yeah, don't know why but I started crying when the Russian ship came near your ship... now I need to figure that out.  Glad Kara did it, too.  Awesome cruise!
This looks so fun! I hope someday I get to experience this!
We’re also with SWOOP and we’re scheduled for Antarctica Nov. 2023
I hope you explain the helicopter it seems to move what do they use it for?
Please consider limiting the content around weight and calories. I usually watch your videos with my kids but will not be sharing this one with them. I appreciate Kara qualifying it not being about weight but the rest of the video, the scale being brought out and talk of off setting calories can influence disordered eating and mindsets around food. Love you guys and am enjoying this series otherwise!
The rock is from Hayward California
I can help with only one of those questions Kara, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is from Hayward, California. Just FYI Zendaya is from Oakland, California. Both locations are about 40 minutes from San Francisco as the crow flies.
Awesome
Awesome video! Looks like a fun day in the life day. And how awesome to be apart of a small group. Just too much fun lol
Looks like a fine cruise!!
Please keep the vlogs flowing. They are A-mazing🥰
I do not want this series to end! Loving this!
💜💜💜
Enjoying your videos.  Please ask Ponant why they charge Americans more than others to go on their cruises.  Prices on their EU website is much lower than on their US website.  Thank you.  Happy travels.
It was great seeing you guys on Instagram live. I love your spirit and enthusiasm
Just two questions: 1) What dates was this shot? 2) Did you pay for this cruise?
We can totally relate! We get super hungry when we work out too. The food looked so so delicious. Those arctic winds are crazy 😱
This video will confuse flat Earthers
I was scared when Kara tried to open the Snow Room's door and it wasn't opening. It was such a relieve to see she was just trying to open it the wrong way 😅😅😅
Awesome video! This looks like an amazing adventure. It’s going on my bucket list. Im excited for the next video!
...but most of the seeds for Dijon mustard grown in France come from Canada! 😀
Look nice
Amazing😃
Is this really a 40000 dollar trip per person? Yikes!
42 knots = approx. 48 mph
21:37 - "episide" :D
I love these videos and looking forward to the remaining 3. Since you've covered the World from pole to pole now the only places left are either under the sea, in the air, or in near space. (hint, hint).
You should have a meet up with Cecilia Blomdahl . I follow her channel. She is from Longyearbyen Swalbart. My bucket list trip! Enjoy yourselves and keep these videos coming!
It is amazing to see the differences between Antarctica and the North Pole. Looking out it is nothing but flat white. In the Antarctica series there were lots of towering glaciers and more wildlife. And the last scene with the two boats passing by..what an experience.  There is that connection and all differences in politics in the world are cast aside for that moment.
Can’t wait for more to watch during my lunch breaks! Definitely loving vicariously through you guys!
How much is this cruise?
That must be like a 35k USD trip?
This video was so fun and I love getting to watch the experience! The ONLY thing I have to say is be careful ordering anything saffron because it harvested in a VERY unethical way. I will not go into detail here because it is gruesome and not appropriate, but if it can be avoided, please do ! Or if you can get clarification about the farm it came from that is great too ! Love you guys, keep up the AMAZING content <3
Its littarly soo pretty 😁💕
So much fun! Seeing that other ship was cool!
What is Nate reading?
This is y’all’s best video yet. Love this series so much
If Don Henley hears that violin playing Hotel California, he'll file a copywright infringement against you. He's psycho about it.
Well don't Nate! (with the snow on Kara!)
You should stop taking a cruise.. really really bad
I just keep thinking how close you are getting to Russia. As the ice melts North Pole area is becoming increasingly more strategic.
My favorite of your series so far has been Antarctica, and this one is right up there as well!  BTW - "episode" is spelled wrong @ 21:37.
8:25 , Where did you get your bathing suit from?!?!  🥰
If you got blown off of the deck, there would be NO rescue ~!!!
amazing!  mahalo
no words you both are most beautiful and luckiest couple enjoying your life through journeys 😊 loads of love from Andhra Pradesh, India ❤️🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳❤️
Can you please put the links for SWOOP (21:40), PONANT (21:44) and "Places to Visit in the Artic" article (21:49) in the article? As well as the specific ship you took to the North Pole? Would love to check it out! Thanks!
👍
Not that it matters now but the Rock Is from HAYWARD CALIFORNIA!! Where I current live. 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
During your snowball fight in the snow room my 4 year old daughter was yelling, “Get him Kara!!!” 😁
42 knots of wind equals 48 mph! That was somw wind!!!
can you guys come to st.vincent please
In one video Kara and Nate are living, eating in luxury and in the other video they are drinking from garbage and I am here for it
Were there other passengers on this cruise? Seems you guys were alone, or the only one using the gym and spa Edit: I did see a few people during happy hour & dinner.
Baby Nate from 2017 my God. I criiii
Fantastic trip😁
The way Nate is looking for Kara from outside is just too funny. Holesome video you made me laugh multiple times!
We love your videos!  Look forward to them every week. We travel vicariously thru your videos.  About the food thing...could you put in a screen shot of the menus where ever you are eating? So we could see what we would eat?  That would be awesome!🍔🍕🌮🍉
The highlight of the trip so far is  snowball fight on a cruise. ⛄️❄️ How FUN! 😄
I am 11 and i am fan kara and nate  live in sa
I just check and check for your next video. I am 64 and retired. I am seeing the world through you. I LOVE  your videos. I have been voting every 24 hrs for you guys for Travel content creators of the year.😁💜
Should have pulled out a Ukrainian flag when you passed that Russian ship.
🏳️‍🌈🤮
My mouth just dropped open when I saw the buffet spread.  Well wow -  looks amazingly yum.    And!  -  I am so glad that I am not the only one who gets so immersed in a book that when I come up for air, I am surprised by my surroundings.
Have been waiting for this
God bless your adventure amazing couple!
wait....where are the links? Did I miss it? I want to plan a polar trip also! 😀
Whenever Kara cried for some reason it made me tear up too, love seeing other people so happy it is contagious 💗
They say rich people can be more miserable because of having so much, but I think if I was super wealthy I'd definitely do doing these cruises on the regular. It's so nice and so pampery.. looks heavenly.
I hope who ever is reading this has a great day and know that god is by ur side
I laughed. I had tears. Loved the frozen snow fight!!
Such a wonderful couple!
I've got no problem with a hat / cap in that restaurant!
I am enjoying this series as well! And whenever Kara cries I tend to cry to. You both generally seem fun to be around. I'm not a huge traveler but have enjoyed learning about new places with you!
what shoes is Nate wearing?!
The snowfight was such a wholesome moment with Nate giggling like a little kid. Enjoy it guys!
This is such an awesome series! Two videos a week should be a thing!
I was so excited when the other ship had everyone waving flags and yelling Bonjour! Oh my gosh, that was an incredible experience! 🥲🥹
Kara -Dwayne Johnson is from Hayward, CA
There arent any sharks in north pole?? what iss? Loved your channel tho
I love how you to have such a good connection and it was funny as the other ship that you were going to go on you went passed and the fight 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
HEY KARA you need to get eye surgery NOW they are gonna buldge out of your head and ripping at the seams
I adore your videos. These adventures are so inspiring to me! Thank you for including us!
@12:36 She's the queen of the world!!  (Just standing in the wrong spot)
Hilarious that you passed the "other ship" that could take you to the North Pole!  Matching outfits with their ship too!  haha. Sadly, I've experienced that level/temp wind you felt...and it wasn't 120 miles from the North Pole, it was just outside Boston in the winter.  Ok it was during a Nor'Easter....but it was cold fun.  Love Kara's plan....workout so you can eat more.  Haha.  Until next week!!
Actuall Dijon area of France no longer grows the mustard plant needed to make the sauce. Canada does.
Have you guys watched Cecilia Blomdahl? She is a YouTuber who lives in Longyearbyen! I started watching her clogs about a year ago and they are so interesting! I was excited to see you guys, Kara and Nate, departing on the North Pole cruise from there! You should check out Cecilia if you haven’t yet.
I never have wanted to go on a cruise…until now.  Love the experience you are having in the North.
I wanna go right now! Is there a way one can win that trip? 😜✌️
Marathon on a cruise ship calling it
YOU ARE GREAT!!! Great at making me feel like I'm there, Great at making it exciting, Great at making it interesting, and Great at making it completely FUN! I may never get to go, but it does my soul good to know I could. It takes a lot to put your videos together for US, just know speaking for myself, I am very grateful. David and Archer my German Shepherd service Dog
It's weird to hear them say "tonight" when it's super bright outside
So random , but why do you the tap over your macbook now?
The ship passing made me want to cry of happiness haha 😂 I Did not expect everyone to jump out there and say like “Bonjour” knowing it’s a French ship 😭 that’s so sweet! The comradely!!
No casino on aboard?
You guys made a wise choice picking the French ship as opposed to the Russian one, which is  - as you pointed out - built in 1989 (the good ol' days LOL) and is an actual atomic icebreaker! Glow in the dark, anyone? LMAO
I want to say that I have really enjoyed your videos, but I have to now unsubscribe from your channel.  While I do support the fact that everyone can make their own choice, I can not support your channel any longer after the comment at the end of the video where you said you considered taking the trip on the Russian ship.  With all the things the Russians are doing to the Ukraine, the many people, children who have died and to hear that you even considered supporting anything Russian is just against everything I stand for.  I wish you both the best, but I can no longer follow you on your life journey.
LOVE how much fun you guys have wherever you go.  My goal is to be just like you when I grow up...even though you're much younger than me!
She’s more FLEXIBLE THAN ME AND IM 10 😭
That Was a fun video.  I loved it
That staff member should be fired for not having cleaned that cap for the olive oil. Other people have to eat from that and you CAN NOT eat from the floor. So disgusting. Floorliveoil.
Brilliant xx
I’m loving this series already. Honestly it’s my dream to make this trip. Either ice breaker will do. Love you’re having the best time.
Kara  I like u
Funny how Mr Covid knows not to infect you as soon as you sit down. You couldn’t make it up!
The ship looks amazing. Its the size of cruise ship I think I would like and the trip itself is a once in a life time experience. Might have to go and win the Euromillions a few times before I can afford it.
Why are you still wearing masks?
Dude, concerning your hat, you do you!!  Don’t worry about haters!!
Wow, those super close ups of the ice chucks from the ship was amazing. Love your guy's routine so far, so fun! And good tip on rearranging phone apps!!!
Damn, you made me check where The Rock is from! 😂
So are they going to give you a compass to see what the needle does while you are at the North Pole?  Being right at the north  Pole i would expect for the needle to not move or spin. Which would be a geographic north I imagine it as being that since you are at the pole you would have to us visual to get around not a compass if you where lost. So the stars or the sun or the moon? Being in just say Canada you pull out the compass and you know at least the direction of north cause the needle is actually pointing north any way you turn. That’s the magnetic part of it.    ❤️🇨🇦
Always shower before a sauna, so as to keep the sauna hygienic. It also dries and damages your hair if it´s not wet before entering :)
Love it. ❤
I remember on your voyage to Antarctica you both took Dramamine for seasickness. What are you taking for this trip?
I love how you used the water and ice as transitions between scenes :) Looks so satisfying to watch!
so good!  i omg... I what  to on that cruise !!! ok ! one day 😄
Today is the 6 months anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To bad there weren't any Ukrainian flags to wave at them instead you wave welcome and talk about the Russian icebreaker and how you decided between taking it and the one you're own. Today I unsubscribed from Kara and Nate.
I'm so loving this exceptional series! Can't wait for the next installment! You both inspire me to set more goals for myself! Thank you!
I actually can not find the right words to best describe the excitement I get from watching your videos... This series in particular though, has been so so inspiring. Thank you Kara and Nate ❤
Subscribed & watching from the northern part of Saskatchewan, Canada 🇨🇦 love watching your travels makes me feel like I can literally taste the food or like I’m there with both of you … I’m for ever impatiently waiting for your next video ❤️
Hey Nate! I know you love wearing baseball caps but they will start to cause hair breakage with continual wear. I would suggest taking breaks as well as putting some type of satin inside of your favorite cap.
I have been watching you guys non stop for the past 2 months <3
How unwatchable have these two grown to be?
I wonder how much this costs. I’d love to do this.
The Rock is from the kitchen.
The snowball fight was the best!
Amazing vlog series y'all 🤠💚
Kara cracked us up waving at the other ship! "Bonjour! I don't know what you're saying!" 😂
See I don't think I could be a foody kinda person and try and stay fit. I'd pass out after eating. Xx
great job with the content it makes me feel better about myself
Seriously, you guys make my day. I've said this before but thank you so much for sharing your adventures. They are all so inspiring and I love how you connect with all of us. 🙂
Can I just say how jealous I am that one day many many years from now your going to be looking back sitting in your backyard as an old couple holding hands proud 🥹 and in utter disbelief that you saw most of the world. I have never been out of the u.s. ur accomplishing what most only dream of . Seeing the world is what life is about. 🫶🏼
Early
I hate it when guys don’t take their hats off in restaurants.  It’s disrespectful.
The most I’ve ever heard Nate laugh lol you guys are too stinkin cute! My God continue to bless your marriage. The boat is beautiful and that blue water is just saw awe inspiring
My favorite part was also the Russian ship with everyone waving and so excited!!  What a heart warming moment especially  with what's happening in the world today.  Thanks for a great video!
You two inspire me to be a better me. Love the energy you guys give.
Can’t wait for video #3!!!!  Hi from Lubbock, Texas!!
in the snow room kara was like NATE NATE 😡😡 NaTe😡. LOL I LOVE KARA SHES SUCH A KIND PERSON
I think I already watched this vlog? did you just re-upload this or you guys went there again? haha confused.
That is very cool!! I never new you could boat up there so cool and majestic!!!
It seems like y'all are the only ones on the ship
Great vlog as always! The magnetic pole is in Northern Canada. Imagine in the old days when the bridge of the ship was open, not closed. Cold and hot. You bet. Love vlogs like these. Safe voyage!
The captain is soooo french.
I recently discovered y’all’s channel and I love it! So much fun and I love all the laughs.❤️
Nate’s face after the strong wind 😅 I love Kara’s “windy do” after experiencing it too 😂 ya’ll are the best!
Great video & really enjoying this series! As I quite fancy doing the same trip, just checked out the cost 😱 Bit out of my price range, Guys 🤦‍♀️
So much fun. I live in Quebec City and here we have a insane freezing like North pole winter... and it's sooooo long. By the way, I came from Brazil. hihihi. What a hack am I doing here? hahahaha... I believe Santa lives just around the corner. ;-) Do you know about the Canadian Northwest Passage? The Northwest Passage (NWP) is the sea route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Arctic Ocean, along the northern coast of North America via waterways through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. For years Russia and US try to get this part for them.
Kate you’re exactly like my wife 😂 . she does that every single time we get into little what she calls spats. she has to feel like she has to Google it just to prove a point and the only way I know if I’m right is if she googles it and doesn’t bring it back up just sits there in silence and murders okay maybe you were right 😆. But God for bid if she’s right I’ll never hear the end of it.🥲
My favorite YouTubers hands down!😁
Never go into a club at a military base with your hat on unless you are ready to purchase a round for everyone. :)
If ever I find myself with time and resources to take this kind of trip, I know which boat to choose!
Fun fact- Kara always cry when she see cute, good, beautiful, etc etc.
Must be nice ….😅
this is amazing😌
Great series! Can't wait until  the next video!
Going weeks without internet just sounds so appealing right now. I wish it were easier to do.
There was something really moving about that moment when you encountered the Russian icebreaker. In moments like that, I realize that we're all in this together. Governments may fight with each other but our shared humanity is undeniable.
Hey Kara rock grow up in Florida in Hawaii
That’s just such a fabulous trip.  Thanks for taking us along with you!  My husband and I often talk about how great it is to now be able to answer our questions with the ease that the internet brings.  Better than having to run to a library or find someone that could answer your question. lol. Can’t wait to find out how Nate is challenging himself, this time. lol
I love Kara and Nate so much like I look forward to them literally every week! You guys are the absolute best and I hope you know how much you make my day!!
You guys are my favorite YouTubers loving this series thank you!
It really is a wake up call that people are not their government. I hear Russian and I think Putin and Ukraine. People hear American / French and they think of whatever stupid thing the political leaders do. Then there's the people on vacation, fishing, and just living their lives, having no part in what their government is doing. Just waving and saying hi to another country without all the political crap that we see every day. It's pretty refreshing.
First thing i Google after first video was this cruise price.. 32k or something.. 😬😬Im sad i have to settle with these videos :( but your videos are great too :)
What are the mask rules? Seems to be no rhyme or reason.
The mid-bread wide-eyed realization that the camera was falling was my highlight for this video 😂
Unfortunately I’m going to unsubscribe. I really enjoyed the van life videos much more as they didn’t feel like some crazy unobtainable lifestyle/goal, and you guys seemed way more down to earth- but these videos nowadays all just feel so non personal and they’re always just another big “flex” of how much money you have. Average people like us viewers are never gonna be able to “take the most expensive train ride in the world” or “get a private flight” or “travel to 60+ countries” blah blah. Sorry, these videos are getting a real Logan Paul feel to them, just flexing luxuries on viewers at every chance while our views continue to fund this lifestyle in the first place.
Guys, I really admire you both a lot. Love your videos and I wish to meet you some day. Can I ask how do you both manage to remain lean and in shape all the time in spite of traveling a lot? Do you eat whatever you want or follow a diet?
Why you just eat and dont feel guilty?. Been watching you for a long time and yeah. Got to the conclusion. That you are that superficial.
Stay safe god bless
This is such an interesting journey...dying to know what it costs.
12:52 best part ✨🍃NaTuRe✨🍃 14:50 second fav part🤣 almost lost the camera and ✨mY WinE✨
a great life hack u r in chine or korean contrys like that use a VPN  to go on the internet  like insta or youtube 😘 hopr it hepls ❣❣🙉🙉
Looks like there are a small number of passengers on the cruise.
You are the only ones there?Seems like that😃.Hugs guys
Wow! Bucket list addition, North Pole Icebreaker Expedition? Yes please!
is this cruise seriously 40 grand a person??
The rock is actually from Hawaii but he lives in LA
bonjur
Fuckin lit 😍
What an experience this trip must be! So cool!!! Looking forward to the next update! God bless!🙏🙏
Haha Man! I can't believe people have so little to worry about that they are so upset about you wearing a hat. I mean... your life, your comfort, you do what you want! It ain't hurting nobody
I just can't let it slide im sorry! 😂  Dijon Mustard used to be grown and processed in all of France, but in the early nineteen-hundreds, the Frenchmen discovered a new type of mustard seed. The Seed they were growing at the time was the commonly used white mustard seed. But the seed they discovered in the town of Dijon where a black one, thereby the name of Dijon. It proved hard to make the black seeded plant grow tho, and therefore black seeded farms slowly shifted to a new country with better conditions for growing them.  CAN you guess the country?  Hint: the First word of my last sentence. Yes! correct, it's Canada. For some weird reason, black seeds grow better in cold environments and are therefore normally grown in Canada.  It is still considered true Dijon if the mustard in the glass contains more than 25% of locally grown seeds from Dijon and is packaged in Dijon France.            -Your dose of completely random unnecessary facts. You're Welcome!
I love the way Kara looks back and says "They're saying Bonjour" at 20:01 haha! Loved this, I also felt so emotional especially when the other ship was beeping whilst parting ways!
Loving this series!! What an awesome experience!
LOL, Nate wearing his baseball cap...........indoors? I would not have noticed, or cared for that matter, unless someone brought it my attention. What's a cowboy without his hat? A few men in my life wear a hat, like a woman wears a bra. It's customary.
why are ppl so pressed abt wearing a hat in a restraunt like its JUST  a hat
Don’t worry, as Americans we don’t expect you to understand hat etiquette 😘
at 1:37 Nate is looking into his phone and the words "show your forehead" are at the bottom of the screen. Is that for identification to go through the buffet?
This is so cool!!! Y’all are living my dream life! Thanks for letting us experience it all through you! ☺️
Is that one of those Carbon neutral crises?  I thought CO2 melted the ice caps?
i love u
“We are currently on an icebreaker ship”  the people who were on the Titanic 👁 👄 👁
7:50.  You're welcome
Nate turned a kind will snow fighting 🤣
I must book a cruise like this soon, very very soon
So curious what the other people on the cruise do for a living to afford this …
🧓🏻Another fantastic video ❣️ thank you for bringing travel joy into my life.   Kara I love your humanity. I was deeply moved by the expressions of camaraderie while the ships 🚢 passed each other. I honestly enjoyed every second of the video,  I wish it went on for another 30 minutes. 🙏🏻 I hope that you two remain grounded, humble & grateful, and continue growing, in knowledge and wisdom as you experience the world and people around you. 🙏🏻may God bless and keep you safe always.    Love,   your ‘other Grama 😉
i wear a hat every dinner just so they have enterainment by complaining about it lol
I can totally relate, I 100% workout so I can still eat pretty much whatever I want
I have seen the polar bear in 2016 When I turn 50 years old
Would have been cool to wave a Ukrainian flag at the Russians.
loved the snow ball fight!
How much was the cost for the entire trip?
Question …if the earth rotates at 1000 miles per hour do you feel dizzy at the North Pole axis ???? Lol
what's the cruise line?
Yay it’s finally up 😃
I love how at 14:36 you see kara have to decide between saving the wine and saving the camera.  For nate there was no choice
I just checked my email as soon as you said it.
This is one of my favorite series so far. Thank you for taking us along with you! This is weird but I cried when you guys were waving to the passengers on the other boat. I imagined that it was me,not seeing other human being for days in the middle of nowhere (aside from the passengers on your boat) and then all of sudden there’s this other boat with people waving enthusiastically at you. Like what Kara said,she felt connected to them. 😁
I'd love to know what Kara said that had to be bleep ed out
Thanks for contributing to the destruction of the northern ice shield you pathetic attention whores
I like the juice glass GLASS STRAW, classy Kara. Anyone that has traveled on a ship knows about yummy pancakes Nate.  It's like a scout badge sort of. Their attitude about everything doth slay, so encouraging.  It is the difference between the spectator and the doer. Any chance you caught up with Santa?  Rearranging, WORD.
Kara I can understand why you got emotional 🥲 it’s such a wild experience and feels like a community with people all over the world. It’s eye opening!
I'm so hype for this series, South Pole was amazing, But now we get somewhat of a flashback of the last series.
i wanan do what they do but i don’t know where to start and i hate it bc i’m so jealous and y’all are gorgeous and i’m so happy for yall but HOWWW
I love to see the world through this channel. I always wanted to travel the world but not everyone is lucky like you guys. Hope you continue and one day we will be like you guys. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I am loving this! I know y’all are on a once in a lifetime cruise, but that one moment in the snow room you two shared, is the type of moment you’ll truly never forget and you will cherish forever. I love the type of laughter that makes you so weak you can’t function lol.
This North Pole videos are awesome!!!  I feel i could live on that ship! ❤️😁🛳️
You picked the lid up off of the floor and then put it on the olive oil. Lol. And THAT is why I don't trust condiments in restaurants. Looks like a nice experience.
I haven't had this much fun watching a video in a long time! Have to admit, I'm a little jealous and have added something new to my bucket list. Thanks guys!
I wonder how many people can say they have been stuck in a traffic jam  in the middle of the north pole 🤣
Kara is my spirit animal😂I love her❤️
This ship is so cool! Love this series!! Do you guys ever get sea sick on these trips? I would be worried about spending a lot of money to go on something so amazing and spend the whole time eating crackers and drinking ginger ale.
That is a brilliant hack to know if you are addicted to your phone or an app
It's really nice to see you guys, I also feel connected. I am a big fan from Bhutan 🇧🇹🇧🇹🇧🇹🇧🇹🇧🇹🇧🇹🇧🇹🇧🇹🇧🇹🇧🇹🇧🇹🇧🇹
42knots is 48mph  This trip looks like fun 🤩
@Kara where’s the bikini from??? Love it
If you liked this spa you should go to sky lagoon in Iceland, absolutely incredible experience
I think I look for the app before I click. I think that's cause I have two, work and personal. Both have the same apps but they're arranged differently.
That wind in the north is no joke! My dad was stationed at CFS Alert (during 6 months of darkness) and told us they had ropes between all of the buildings to hold onto so you didn’t get blown away. Upside of the tour was that he was Celine Dion’s military escort. He didn’t know who she was (it was the early 90s) but it’s a fun story now 😆
I think this is probably one of my favorite series/places yall have done! Can't wait for   the next one.
Loving this North Pole adventure.
Ok I love you guys not that I didn’t already up your snow fight melted my cold heart 💜
Thank you for sharing your travels with us, as a young adult this really makes me want to see travel the world and have a connection with nature. I’ve been a subscriber for a while and plan to stay a subscriber. ❤️
Incredible.  I have soooo much fun to watch ur north pole series. I am smiling..giggling..enjoying the superb food..sipping a cocktail..relaxing in the sauna..feel connected with the people on the Russian ship..and being grateful for all your work you do that I can watch finally your wonderful adventures. Love from Bali.
“Am I the only one making their bucket list watching this beautiful couple….!”
Kara, you’re hilarious I just love you!  When you came in from the crazy wind and said, “nature” I carried laughing.. the edit was on point 😂
🙏
My guess is Nate’s secret challenge is run marathon in the North Pole( on the ship of course)
OMG, truly amazing!  Definitely something I'd love to do. Your snow fight was hilarious 😂 You're both SOOO adorable! Thanks for sharing this once-in-a-lifetime experience! 💙🌀🌍
This makes me miss being on the MSC cruise
A snowball fight INSIDE the ship in the arctic! That's bizarre!  Have fun. You bring me and others so much joy.
So much fun! Thank you! 🎉
Wouldnt it be nice if the people on the russian boat are AGAINST whats happening to Ukrain and they are showing their solidarity.  My eyes are watering
You can’t complain about the cold and walk around outside in the deck with no socks on!
Nates running a marathon
Missed you guys! Not sure why I stopped getting notified of your adventures. Anyway.. love to see ya!
Amazing
The best part about this video is knowing there are still 3 more to come!
This should be a show on the travel channel or bravo!!!  You guys deserve your own show for sure!!!!!!!
Seeing the relationship/bestfriendship/partnership between you two has made me realize what I deserve and also seeing you two travel made me realize what I want out of life! I've been here for 4 of your 6 years now and you guys have remained so grounded and adorably funny and sweet! I'm a huge fan and get so excited when I see a new post!  Have the most wonderful time!   Don't ever change!  -- Dana -- (going onto 27-years-old and inspired)
Hey Kara and Nate! I love this video series - I just wanted to point out in your banner - it should read 'We've travelled to 100 countries and not 'We travelled' - I know this is very minor but I thought I would point it out as I would want to know if I was a content creator :) Freaking love you guys!!! ALSO I would love to design a banner for you guys if you are interested? Please let me know :) So happy to see you guys are enjoying Kingston, ON, Canada. I live about 30 mins from Eamon and Bec xxxx
Please do a food review of the ship
we were on Holiday in Dijon this past summer, the moustarde is phenomenal. btw very tempted to put this whole cruise and adventure on our bucket list.
Seriously love these videos
I just need, one time, for you to keep a shot of Nate running back to get the camera 😂
This series is so fun!!! I have watch every single one of y'all's videos at LEAST once, and these may be my new favs. <3
Kara & Nate! You Rock!! Loving this series! ❤️
4:27 Kara is 59 kg / 130lbs (maybe 57/125 without clothes). She has very low body fat so she must have a lot muscle or she’s 5ft 10 inches tall.
Great video and by the way the rock is from a lot of different places but he did go to school not too far from where I live in Pennsylvania.
Omg I’m laughing so hard about your hat Nate!  Years ago, my cousin brought her now ex boyfriend over to my grandparents house and he always had a hat on. It drove my grandfather nuts!!  Let’s just say Popadore was very happy when my cousin was no longer dating the hat man 😂
This series is AMAZING!!
Thank you for letting us live vicariously through you. We booked a cruise on Viking to Antarctica after seeing your video of your expedition.  You two have worked hard to be at the level of success you are benefiting from. Enjoy it all while you are young.  Keep on keeping on.
401st comment, I know y’all never read this but me and my wife love y’all. We sit down during family time and watch y’all’s content. Y’all bring joy and excitement to our day, we hope to become like y’all one day.   THANK YOU FOR ALL THE GREAT CONTENT KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK
I’m honestly so jealous of y’all but at the same time I cry every episode because you both are so sweet and I’m so happy for y’all
I love yalls videos! sending love from San Antonio Texas ❤  I hope all is well 🙏
Incredible video!!! Love seeing the world through your eyes!!! This video came out on my Birthday and it made me feel like I got to go on a cruise for my birthday!!! Thank you!!! Safe travels!!!
I love the 2 of you having a snowball fight in the cold room. Kara watching you dry your runners with a dryer last week was funny. You should check out Vessi shoes. They are waterproof.  I wore mine all winter through rain, snow and slush and no wet shoes , socks or feet. They are lightweight  and comfortable.
I just found your channel about a few weeks ago and I have binge watching every video. I love love love the content you beautiful couple put out!!!!! 😍😍😍😍💖💖💖💖💖
I could not stop cracking up after seeing your guys’ reaction to the camera falling at the dinner table haha ! Kara you are too funny 🤣🤣
Yay top 397 comments. Love this content. Best to you and your families. Happy Wednesday.
Very cool experience indeed❣️ Especially meeting up with the Russian icebreaker ship 🚢
Why did I cry when you passed the other ship??? 🥲
First one
You dont like captain’s french accent?! 😂😂
I love your vids so so much Kara you are the  best part
What is the name of the ship please
You know Everybody, throughout the history of human beings, whenever a couple is cloistered together, sometimes a wonderful thing can happen in about 40 weeks. So, I am wondering what week this is??????
These videos are too good! I just can’t wait to see all episodes! This is one of my biggest dreams, to board this ship to the North and South Pole, if it wasn’t 50k$ I was going to be on one right now, it’s just an extraordinary experience! I’m curious which pole you enjoyed more, I think they are very different even though it looks similar. If I need to pick I guess I’ll go first to the South Pole, I would like to know which one is your favorite 🤩
Awe 🫢 snow ball fight that’s was so cute, y’all look like teenagers falling in love all over again
I love the 2 of you having a snowball fight in the cold room. Seeing Kara drying her shoes last week with a dryer was funny. Kara you should check out Vessi shoes. They are water proof. I wore mine in the rain, snow and slush in Calgary Alberta. No wet feet. They are lightweight and comfortable.
I'm so addicted to my phone, that we like old married couple who never live their life without each other.
Your videos are so good I have watched your videos each time like 10 times that
Kara, the Rock is from Hayward, CA. :) Love your videos!
I’ve been away for like a month and I really need to catch up on your videos haha<3
Why the fuck does this come up when I looked up 1960 corvette?
What a fun series!
That snow fight was the SWEETEST thing I’ve ever seen! Just adore y’all so much 💓 Absolutely love y’all’s love ☺️☺️☺️
Now you’ve seen firsthand why the polar ice caps are melting, it’s not global warming, it’s all the icebreakers keeping the water flowing and everyone knows the running water doesn’t freeze. Stop the icebreakers and let it freeze back up…..
So you can't take your hat off when you're eating? It takes 1 second. Freaking Americans...
Wow...I was so glad to hear that I wasn't the only one crying over the greetings between ships. It wzs a true sign that people operating independent of political propaganda are lovely loving creatures all Over the world. So, so touching.
I absolutely love all these videos so much. You guys are my fav youtubers <3  But like a part of me is also curious what impact this has on the environment. Like each time I hear that the ship is breaking Glaciers, I'm left wondering if that's okay or not. I can only hope that those who have created it have taken care of it and also that the frequency of these ships isn't that huge or else they have the potential to damage so much.   Still love your videos and it's definitely cool to see the north pole. I guess in a way this helps because I can see it from the confines of my room but won't have to use the ship ever in life, not that I can afford it anyway :P
This cruise looks doper than the Caribbean ones, but it also looks damn expensive
The joy you felt when passing the Russian icebreaker was so contagious, I had tears in my eyes! One of my favourite episodes on your channel so far🤍
Blackpink or this
How the elite live
I love this you guys keep bringing such amazing content.  Watching for years and I still can't wait for the next .  Love you guys
I'm loving this series!! Thank you for sharing with us!!
Another great vlog you two. Keep them coming Kara because I know Nate is out with Eamon right now and it's just you and Bec and Oso, so relax but keep working too lmao!
This actually looks really fun .  Not having a bunch of stops that you feel like you have to go and do excursions off the ship gives you the ability to truly relax and do nothing if you want .
I died of laughter when Nate was trying to get through the wind
Dont worry about the hat. They can build a bridge and get over it.
Was this a gratis trip by Ponant?
The people who discovered and explored the north pole in the early early years are ROLLING in their graves at your heated pool and dining rooms
So excited to follow you guys on this epic journey!
Still wearing swimwear in sauna, you have been to finland, sweden and baltics, you should know better !
I got emotional when the two ships were greeting each other. With so much turmoil & uncertainty I know I felt a sense of Peace & Love. Thank you.  Safe Travels.
no one cares about the war in Ukraine?
You guys always, and I mean always, make my day!! Now I go to work and think about the episode....and be happy!! Thank you....I love you guys!
Love love love this series! Favorite so far.
The crew members were so nice! One time I was tenting in a storm with 130 km/h winds! (80 mp/h) u couldn't even walk in a straight line! It left like I cou,d go thr speed of light when I was walking with the wind
"Links to the companies, in the description below" .  Cant find the links....
Kara and nate’s life and relationship TOTALLY doesnt make me jealous 🥹🥹🥹
they are rgularly scheduled trips russia and this one so I imagine that they cross paths several times per year. sorry nate.
So this is how the 1% live.  Crazy luxury .thanks for sharing
out of curiosity what song was nate listening to whist he was running ?
This series continues to be epic! Cheers outa Boston from a former native Nashvillian!
Amazing
$66,000 total for their cabin (2 tickets at $33,000). HOwever the company does offer smaller packages nearer to $4000-$10,000.
Broken ice melts faster, I think no ship should be there, otherwise there won't be any wild life to observe soon.
😘😘😘
Honestly, who cares what you wear on your head when you eat. That's really annoying that they made you feel like that Nate, keep the hat on as much as you like!
All I can think about watching these North Pole episodes is the movie where'd you go bernadette!
What's with the multiple helicopters? Commuters?
Where are the links? Am I the only not seeing them??
I know what you mean Kara. I routinely set goals starting from 5-6pm every evening I actually abandon  my phone , tv, internet because I have to use it for university and do activities that relaxing and quiet so my brain will be calm before bed.  It is challenging , but you will get use to it and it is so worth it.
42 knots! The tiny plane I flew a while ago could only take off under 20 knots (it was a tiny plane) and you managed to walk in double that. Oh my word I’m genuinely shocked 😂
I love y'all my heart skips a beat every time I see you on a cruise ship that breaks icebergs
I have a crazy question: isn't it bad for big ices in the North Pole that this ice breaker ship breaks them? Is it ok for nature to do it?!!! 🤔😉😀
16:14 -16:26 🤣🤣🤣 I love that! And it is an interesting way to think about it, I have never thought about it that way. But it cracked me up good the way Nate said it 😂😁
Nate’s giggling during the snowball fight had me cracking up 😂 You guys are like big kids, in the best way possible.
Wow 🎉. Amazing excursion! ! !
I actually admire how much joy Kara radiates through the screen. Love your video's so much!!!!!! Keep up the amazing work! Much love from Belgium <3
I mean technically it's more an ice crusher then a breaker
is china virus still alive and well on cruise ships that go to the north pole?
One thing I hope Kara and Nate touch on is the melting ice caps. I know this isn't a political channel but I'm pretty certain this trip might not have been possible 50 years ago (I may be wrong, they are doing it in the heart of summer). If that's the case I think its worth noting and if it's not the case, well that's kind of interesting too. Just my 2 cents. Not trying to cause any trouble. Love the channel, wish I could be more like you.
Yes to the YES!
WTF? Sauna with a bikini on?!?! Phone addiction? Just get rid of the stupid not so smartphone and use an old school mobile phone.
Can y’all list what you had for dinner the night you did this video?    Someone better tie a rope around Kara in that wind! lol  ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS:  Dwayne Douglas Johnson, also known as The Rock, was born on May 2, 1972 in Hayward, California.  Another awesome video!
Looks beautiful
hey try roling in the snow then going in the sauna amazing felling :)
Love to watch you guys travelling all around the world. Although I don't have the opportunity to travel, I love to watch these vlogs and I personally enjoy a lot watching the excitement in you guys when visiting these lovely places. Keep doing these amazing vlogs. Love you guys ❤️❤️. Stay safe and blessed ❤️.
Dears I have enjoyed a lot the 2 episodes and I am waiting to watch the third one. The trip to the north pole is very interesting and is an adventure one. Thank you for these series of videos and waiting more
thats some neature
You have taken cold weather travel to the next level! You guys are so much fun to watch! Such a luxurious excursion….the snowball fight was the BEST! 😂
So awesome!
A cruise like that is 30k so the food better be good
Your videos make me feel like I'm there! I love all of your videos!
Kara’s Body is Incredible
Super interesting and cool.!
I could watch JUST the breaking of the ice for HOURS
I thought my cruise to the Artic was badass.  This is 10x better!
I’m loving these videos ! Absolute dream come true that ship looks amazing , I’m not jealous…honest 😉✌🏻😬
Just listening to them giggling while throwing snow at each other- so therapeutic
If the North Pole is just frozen water, where does Santa live?     Y’all better look for him up there….  😉
Sweet for breakfast? For Norwegians, it is limited to Saturdays when the TV is switched on and the family gathers.
SHIP SHIP SHIIIIIIP! Lol, not a boat!
Wonderful Wednesday with Kara and Nate! Will be watching later with my wife.  Being from Southern Manitoba, the North Pole seems a doable adventure some day yet it still so far away.
That is nice how you make her a coffee everyday
I don't know where they are taking you but no one outside of the elite are allowed at the actual pole.
From where did you book this trip? Any promising resources who has enough experience who arranges this trip for travelers?
Guys I was looking on the website which exact sailing is this one?
Ive been watching your channel like a hawk for the recent couple days, I am so excited to see the  episodes to come. Love ya Kara and Nate!!!!
Have your shoes dried yet Kara?😂😂
Amazing series
It looks so fun there!!
I'm attached to my phone but because I'm in the news business. It's my job to be plugged in 24/7. So when I do get vacation time, my go-to is a little Air BNB cabin near me that is in the woods and has no wifi. I bring like 7 books and just motor through them.
I do the same thing Kara! I've sorta fixed it by limiting my social apps(email included) to about 30 minutes (maybe longer if I need to talk to someone). But I HATE when I scroll through Instagram, then close the app and mindlessly reopen Instagram 🤣🙄😵
Oh my, I'm green with envy!  I love cruises and you two are just having so much fun!!  Great times!!
Your videos could be one hour long with no additional content and I would still devour them from start to finish.
This is so inspiring! what an adventure. Out of curiosity, which specific tour did you book? there are many options for arctic cruises at the companies you mention
I love the videos, but I am kind of sad how you guys are oblivious to how much ice is being melted by doing this.
So excited when I see these videos come up. Absolutely stunning!! Kara crying when she saw the other people is absolutely priceless but that’s just her. Can’t wait to see the polar bears.
Is anyone else always starving after swimming
That snowball fight hahaha
I love you guys I’m 12 like I love to watch traveling like stuff like that and I love to travel like me and my parents travel so much even no we have a sibling that has a disability but we travel a lot like it’s so fun to watch you guys and now my parents are starting to watch you and stuff so yeah
Hahaha the fact that they care that much about your hat.... i say get a life people. Who are you to say that to these legends??? Huh? 🤣🤣
X×1.15=MPH.
Norwegian polar exploring heroes Nansen Amundsen and more did it the HARD way
Experts: The ice room spa cools your heated muscles, stimulates and revitalizes your skin cells.  Kara and Nate: Snowball fight!!! 😂
You guys are the best YouTubers ever!!!
Nice testimonial about internet / iphone / smartphone addiction, Kara! I believe you should get: 1) A phone for calling 2) A miniature camera for photos 3) An iPad or other tablet for YouTube and browsing 4) A Laptop for E-Mails / Editing / Work That way you may leave your tablet when you go to dinner, so you don't browse. Take your phone and laptop to the coffee shop to do some work. Take your tablet if you want to browse YouTube.  The trick is to do one thing at a time, multitasking is supposed to be bad for you.
Thanks for taking us along! I’ve been smiling ear to ear throughout this entire video!!!😊 You two are the best.
The Captain sounds like a evil mastermind……
I’ve never seen two more self absorbed people.  People are struggling and losing all they have , verge of war, probable famines, economic collapse and these two living in fantasy land drinking their coffee in luxury.  Not a hater. I started out liking their personalities and more simple way of life. I’m not saying their show should be doom and gloom.  They just seem devoid of reality now. Almost narcissistic. What happened to the two that went on mission trips and seemed to believe in God?   I miss that couple. Maybe true life will catch up with them one day again.
Traditionally it is rude to wear a hat in a restaurant, it's just that nobody follows tradition or cares about being classic anymore. But on a cruise ship Traditionally again, people dressed up to go to dinner So men wouldn't wear a hat while eating.
If you are wearing a hat, then wear it the right way.
Y'all are living/working my dream life and career! I know some influencers are weird about sharing their ways, but it would be dope to hear some tips from y'all on how to get started, and maintain a career in travel content creation
When Kara tried to pull the push door in the snow room makes my heart pound. That is giving final destination vibe. Please don't make me panic like that 😭😭😭😭
That was a beautiful video! Definitely on my bucket list now!
I know that your life is one continuous working vacation but this feels like a real one. Super comforting to watch.👌
That was a fast 22 minutes. This is an awesome series.
Yes the hat indoors does take your class factor down a few notches.  Loose the hat.
Love that you just popped up on gay travel vlog search!  Because I am gay, and love you guys!  Lol. Had to share.
I can't do ships but I am getting so much joy out of watching you guys having fun on one!
the rock is from samoa
Kara, I absolutely love you for relating eating with hunger and not weight and that you love to eat food. Such a positive way to think about it! I cannot physically take in the amount of protein I am supposed to if I don't work out!
Its 35°C where I live right now, this video helps cooling me ; )
Congratulations ur tour
YAYYYY this video was so fun!! i can’t wait until the next one!!! ty kara and nate for living out my childhood dreams🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
hello
The ship looks absolutely beautiful! Wow!!
It’s not the hat in the restaurant, it’s the backward hat. Anyone over 30 shouldn’t have to be wearing a backward hat in public🤭 trust me you will look back on some of these a few years down the road and say what was I thinking with the backward hat, sorry just looks ridiculous at your age.  But that’s just me. Other than the hat love your videos. Damn The torpedoes full speed ahead.
hi
It would be a dream come true if you were to reply
You guys must be incredibly rich. You are living the life that I would do if I could afford it. Your videos are all unique and I love them!
The way you said “Bonjour” with your retainer in lol 😂
I LOVE YOU GUYS 😢❤ MY INSPIRATION
What kind of a sauna is that the when you can breath in the steam and not recoil
16 Days with out internet to the cell phone. How many apps needed updating lol
I don’t know why but I swear every time Kara cries, good or bad, it makes me cry. She has the most beautiful soul and I’m just so happy I get to watch your videos and live vicariously through you guys!
U dont count cruise in days, just in kg😎
I hate cold but this trip just changed my mind, I'd love to visit the North pole someday, hopefully, I don't freeze to death!I don't know how you eat Kara after workouts, I completely lose appetite after a workout.
I love this.
Why cant humans be this nice to each other all the time and everywhere? I felt that human connection free from all prejudice it actually made me tear up!
When you're on a cruise, calories DO NOT exist. Lol.
so rude to wear a hat when you eat so for as long as you have had your phone how often do you actually make calls
I’m so loving this series!  And yes.. phone addition is real!  I was in Yellowstone for 4 days and like to went mad!  Of course I was alone so wanted to talk to my hubby!
Yassss queennnnn
A icebreaker from Sweden used to be on the north pole. But it's not a cruise
Is there a way you can see how many times a video has been paused?
Did you forget the war in Ukraine?
Kara! I loved your "Pretty Woman" moment with the cap of the olive oil instead of an escargot!
I enjoy y’all channel so much! Im finally here for an early upload 🔥🔥
Sart 🥰
You two make me so happy.  I am envious, but happy for the two of you.  This adventure has to be the best one ever.  I love to cruise and I sooooooooooooo wish I could be there with you.  The peacefulness of it all is amazing and you are giving me and thousands of others the chance to see the North Pole.  I have never thought about the fact that there is no land there, but it makes sense.  I guess we really do not know all these things unless we venture into them.  Love you guys.
Hey hey! Me and my family love your videos! I've added "whoa baby" to my daily vocabulary
I love the way you think Kara, I also love food and love to eat but it never occurred to me to offset that love w/ a healthy habit like exercising.   I just let myself get to almost 300 lbs, then I went to Mexico and got weight loss surgery lol I couldn't make myself quit eating like a bear gearing up for Winter so I had to literally have 85% of my stomach removed so I couldn't physically eat as much as I used to.  It definitely worked but I still miss being able to eat as much as I wanted.
Where did you board the ship?
Ironically, watching the snowball fight really warmed my heart! Keep on being awesome, you two
It's feels like I'm watching Kdrama series on Netflix. 😆 Excited for the next episode. I hope it's 1hr video. Haha
Too many ads
Growing up north of 60, it has always been a dream of mine to experience the North Pole. What a transformative and inspiring place on this planet. Thank you for the fun idea of how to make that happen. I’m excited that I finally caught up with all of your videos and am able to watch as they come now. Keep adventuring and having a great time, it’s been such a joy to follow and laugh along(and inspiring for future travels). **check out Yellowknife (and the surrounding area)NWT sometime(my home town). Lots of fun adventures and a very artistic community. ❤️
Am I the only one with tears after seeing the  two ships pass?  Something about being in such a remote place,  then meeting another large group of people in that same remote place, moved my soul.
I have a feeling Nate is trying a lazy ironman. Rubbing, biking and swimming the iron man length on you own time...
Love love love this series! And so happy you are reunited with Eamon and Bec right now!
Johnson was born in Hayward, California on May 2, 1972 😉
I am finding this trip relaxing, like a school snow day with hot chocolate and watching the snow falling. This is a once in a lifetime trip, a place no one ever will go but it amazingly beautiful. I can’t wait to see the northern polar plunge if it’s anything like Antarctic trip it going to be fun. I imagine instead of vodka, it going to be champagne 🍾
I love watching your content because I can't do these thing that you guys do!
Oh my good lord!  North Pole trip... wow!  You guys are just finding the most amazing places to visit... keep up the adventure Kara and Nate!
cannot wait for the next episode!!! love your channel and hello from the Uk 🥰🥰
Hello. I Love watching you 2. I'm unable to travel due to Health issues so I LOVEEEE watching you 2 cuz it's like I'm able to travel along with you guys to all the beautiful and  exciting places I'd LOVE to go too but cant. I LOVE how welcoming, inviting, informative, detailed and friendly you 2 are in all ur amazing videos so Thank you for all ur weekly videos they enhance my life.
I loved this….. love it… love love love
no internet? how are you going to verify your GPS coordinates are actually 90° N?
Throw away the hat
I really love this series! So interesting and exciting!
❄❄☃⛄🌨🐻‍❄🐻‍❄🦭🦭💙💙 BEAUTIFUL AMAZING TRIP. I have always said I would never go on a cruise ship...UNTIL THIS VIDEO...I would love to go on this ship!! Amazing job to the Captain & Crew!! 🌊⚓  got rid of my iPhone 12+ years ago...dont miss it what so ever...LIVE IN 1983 !! (not in 1984).
Naked snow ball fights 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I have been waiting on this video all week. Couldn’t wait to see the adventures in the North Pole. I love you guy’s ❤️
I think the first thing you ate for dinner was moujadara which is Lebanese I love itt
And yes Kara I do agree with you-you are not the only one working out just to eat more delicious food!!! I do that all the time!😂😂
im convinced if cara and nate lived in the future...the boat would be a space ship...and they would upload videos on "daily life onboard of the space something bla bla bla ship" and make tours on activititys you can do such taking a bath in front of plants hahaha. (Love ya guys) :D
I love your content ❤️🥰 and I love the view of the icey 💦🌊. God bless you both 👼👼👼👼
Simply stunning .. happy tears, how crazy 😂🙄🤣🥴🫣😂
Wow and wow So glad you've taken this cruise an sharing your fabulous adventures
Nate is looking awesome since that post pandemic video where he said something about getting a gut
Kara is such an empath I love it!
sitting here being JELLY of your adventures, keep sharing and having fun. About the hat thing, tell people to mind their own business. I never understood in this wild world why it's ok for females to wear hats anywhere b/c they are "dressy" and yet men can't. I say NAY on that. A hat isn't disrespectful in any place. It's just a hat. People are going to hate. Be you!
The last part 🥹🥹❤️❤️ BONJOUR!!!
I didn't want this video to end.
HELLO
I completely agree with Kara on loving to eat! And I do the same thing!
Lmao fancy is just not for us man 😂
🚁🛥⛴🛳🚤 THAT WOULD BE SO COOL TO GO TO THE NORTH POLE WOW ..⛴🛳🚤⛵☃❄⛄
Hmm  that didn't sound like wind.. they're probably experimenting on seals somewhere on that ship😬😱💀
Wait!  Why does the ship have big steel blast doors outside the regular sliding glass doors at 16:51 ?
Kara's Tennessee accent saying "Bonjour" is everything
Snow room, favorite clip of the series so far! Hahaha! Marriage goals
I am loving your trip. Thank you so much for showing us this ship and the journey to the North Pole. Loved the 'two ship passing in the night'.
I’ve been waiting for this one :))
How the weiter run to pick the lid up!!!!!! 🙏🙏🙏😍😍😍
I love the North Pole series! Excited to see the rest of your journey.  You two also have reignited the travel bug in me, and I’m planning a crazy trip around the world. I blame and thank you both! 😉
I totally love watching your videos….. you are the sweetest couple ever!!!!!!!
I so wanna watch this episode in slow mo just so I could make the most of the 22 minutes I am OBSESSED with this new series 😍
A few years back I was in Santa Monica, CA and a huge wind storm blew in. I was on my bike and had to get off and hold a pole; a headwind more than 50 mph. This old lady was running because the wind was pushing her, she almost went into PCH! I ended up holding on to the pole until the bus came while trying to keep my road bike from becoming a kite.
I guess hats in restaurants is a status thing. In “ye olden days” you couldn’t wear a hat inside. Until recently all the rich successful people were old (or raised by people from those times). Now there is more “young money” and therefore hats in restaurants are ok. Just like the guy wearing dirty jeans and a t-shirt earning more than the guy in a suit and tie is ok.
What an amazing adventure! Thanks for sharing your journey with us!!!
the food looks amazing.
Who cares about dumb societal rules. Wear the hatttt 😎🤙🏼
Probably one of your most coolest experiences ☺️
The way the other boat's passengers coordinated yelling greetings at your ship was so heartwarming!
That was so cool seeing the other ice breaker.
That's an amazing experience! You definitely have a much better ship!!! I watched videos from that Russian one, and it's so much worse comparing to yours.
Love to watch you guys. And I sometime like to daydream that I am  doing what you two are doing.
The highlight of the week when you post a new video
It’s going to be an ultramarathon isn’t it? I was to call out my guess from Kara’s bleeped spoiler.
Hey guys loved your Antarctica series And I liking this series. Have a good day
You two remind me of Howard and Hilda in your orange jackets. 😂 (🇬🇧 Sit Com)
The fact you managed to get the Neature guy in this video is fantastic
This series literally got me searching all about the ship because I legit want to do this now!! Love love love the series ❤️
Such a fun adventure! I will have to enjoy it through your eyes as I looked up the $$$ of this trip and almost fainted.
I’m so early!!! I love you both!!!
I love y’all putting the hat hate comments on blast 😂 #LongLiveTheHat
We need to know how much it costs?
Amazing 👏
My heart missed a beat when Kara couldn't open the door at the first try 😅
Hello im Norwegian
Simply just love this mini serie 💛 Wish that it never would end 🙈🤍✨💛
I've been following you for over a year now and have watched every single video. I love your work and you two, you guys are such an inspiration to me to be kind and to follow my dreams. thank you!! <3
Plot Twist: That snow was made from the frozen sweat of other people. LMAO. I am so happy you guys are having a great time. Thanks for taking us with you!!!! I love your adventures.
do not pick on nate. he needs the security that the hat gives him. plus he needs the cool factor of wearing the hat wrong. phew so coool.
You guys should try heliskiing I would recommend Viking Heliskiing in Siglufjörður,Iceland
PS Kara ads NIiiiiiice to wearing her bikini, also Wow,
i clicked on this video faster than James Charles says hey sisters
He ran. He FREAKIN ran to give you the olive oil cap back. This man is on another level.
My first video I've watched was your trip to Antarctica ❤️ you guys are the greatest! Thank you for sharing your journey
This journey would be a dream
I have been looking forward to see all your video's xx I love all your video's xx
I was in love with this series from the first episode! And 22:00 minutes is too short :) More!
thank you for always posting o time its really fun to look forward to!!!
Almost one of the best travel Youtubers second place
D😍
yesssssssssssssssssssssss
feels illegal to be this early
Hey how can we recognize you without your cap, you ad cool to wearing caps, great video as usual
Your both going to be sorry for living your lives like this was all there is.  YOU must be born again.
Nates trying to run a certain number of kilometers?
Same Kara same I love to eat as well 🤣
Love you and You’re Contant. I’m from Norway 🇳🇴🇳🇴🇳🇴🇳🇴
I workout so I can eat more too! I’m only 5 feet and weigh 97lbs and my goal is to eat at least 2000 calories,currently 1875, cause I love food especially sweets so in order to enjoy all that food and keep my physique the same I have to workout and get more muscle on me
both of you have excellent weights.
North poly weather👍😁
Just what I needed today 😊 Love 'spending time' with you guys 😅
I think Nate laughing like a little kid ,as he throws snow at Kara, is my favorite part 🤣
The way the staff member went SPRINTING toward the olive oil cap for Kara 😂😂😂 everyone there seems wonderful 🥰
i love your videos
Love you guys been watching for 4 years
I love yall
Friends don't let friends "line dance"  It's a rule!
Tnx for the taking me to the trip to North pole..
Great way to live. I'm all about exercising to eat. Great goals!  Love the snow room❄️   Thanks for sharing!
I cant with the guy running a foot to get Kara's dropped olive oil cap! XD
People get so testy when it comes to wearing a hat in a restaurant 🙄🙄
Well, great but…is anyone else is confused why an icebreaker tour when we are in the middle of the August?
Hi
Thank you!!! finally an American fellow who discovers & admits that the French moutarde de Dijon is way better than the US sweet mustard!
Omg this is so lovely and wonderful vlog guys ❤️🥰🥰
I love your videos!!
Yes! So happy for a video today. Hope you're having fun with eamon and bec ♥️ I'm so glad Bec is healthy enough for y'all to visit. That russian ship was so cool!
I love how even when you are doing something epic, you add more challenge to make it even awesome.
Love you guys and all your adventures. Can’t wait to see your adventures with Eamon and Bec.
I feel like  Kara and Nate are basically our virtual tour guides of the world
Congrats on figuring out life!  You may not think you have but with outside perspective…job well done!  You give so many people joy while creating a life for yourselves.  What more can you ask for.  See u down the road!  Thank u!

Dear Kara and Nate , we have been following your channel since 2016.Coincidently this was also the year we got married and you guys had just began with your 100 countries adventure. We feel super proud of what you have achieved over the last 6 years and serve as an inspiration for couples around the world who want to choose a career around travel film making. Having said that, we decided to transition full time into travel filmmaking last month. Thank you for showing us how its done and making us believe in this. All the very best to you guys and we hope to cross paths some day. -Pooja & Shravan

I totally agree that working out makes eating way more enjoyable
Such a good vlog!
I love you guys! 🤗 You make me want to go on this cruise!
100% can relate to feeling more hungry after you work out. I love travelling to hike in new areas, but being able to guilt free stuff my face with foods at the end of a hiking day is equally as good!
I love your videos so much!! I want to travel the world even more when I watch you guys!!  I love cruising and and this cruise to the north pole looks really cool!

I’m so excited for this!! ❄️
I am a Zookeeper in Chicago and I regularly feed the Hippos day old sausages so they have a taste of their home. I put strings on the Sausages and swing them around the Hippos they get so mad at me and Scream but it's an obsession and the hippos try and Break out of their cages but I keep swinging those hotdogs in Wide Circles over their heads. Luckily my boss doesn't know HAHA 😎 😉
Yay
LOVE
First! So excited to watch!
