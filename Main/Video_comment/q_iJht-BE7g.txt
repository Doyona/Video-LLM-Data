John 3:16-18    Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Whoever you worship on earth is who you will worship in the afterlife. Repent before it is too late Please i plead with you for the sake of God and your souls.

Where's the original vid gone?
Another slapper 🔋🔋🔋🔥🔥🔥
💣💣💣💣
i aint being rude..just because  I ain't feeling a certain tune, it dnt mean it ain't no good.. I mean who the feck am I. as Bugsy is amazing  and I wish him all the best he has pure TALENT. so i writing this with No hate at all but just my opinion.. anyways  that beat sounds a bit like pop, I guess it all depends on what type of people they are trying to attract,  the real youngens will prob love this, shame this didn't get released in time for the begining of the summer ,in time for the youngens clubbing in Ibiza etc.  they could more than likely make a pretty packet , This tune  almost reminds me of That old tune called "Sweet like chocolate ".  BUGSYS  vocals r fire tho.  😊 fair play to  Bugsy , hes doing it and winning All the best n looking forward  to hearing more of Bugsy.😊
Only mist can release a video with same bars twice 😂
Been a fan of bugzy almost 8 years and Mist almost as long, so great to see the collab 🍾

Big Up Bugzy and Mist 🇵🇱
This is a mad link up here before a million views this is so wavey
I liked this music
Why did it get reuploaded ?
Cold
Fire
Rights
Git up
Oh yeah baby
I see u ed
So it's just a rehash of their original music video (I know their other got taken down), on a GRM Daily set... right. I expect better from Bugzy, he knows full well how to play his "fans" on social media. It's not unreasonable to have expected a new track, based on how he presented it. He needs to release the collaboration he did with Meekz Manny, that was heard playing in the car on their Instagram post.
