What a comeback NZ♥️I didn't really think NZ will score 250+...Well played Blundell & Conway👏👏♥️
Open stadiums cold temperature beautiful pitches cricket in newzealand hits different
prime video is not telecasting 2nd test match..pathethic amazon prime..why they buy right of tour if you can not livestream.absolutely pathethic amazon prime videos
5:33 that insane reflex from *Root* 😱
Playing Cricket in sena>>>Playing Cricket in asia
7:16 for a moment I thought it was Harsha Bhogle
Hi
England is gonna change the way Test Cricket is played. Unfortunately, I am worried that it may lose its credibility since Test Cricket is supposed to be the toughest format and if bowlers get thrashed like they do in T20s then, it would no more be called as the 'Test'
why u so late dety ho highlights bhnchod 😢
We need complete highlight not only ur key moments
Sensational innings from Tom blundell
just love watching it

Man robinson is some bowler 🤛
Ind vs aus test series india win 4-0
The way England is Playing Aggressive Cricket next WTC they will surely win Championship
Can't wait to see INDIA at the top spot in all 3 formats at a time. Proud to be an Indian. Jai Bharat. India will be No.1 in tests in just a few days
For a moment, I thought he was Eminem but he was convay with the beard
Conway, Harry brook, Labuchange way better than Babar azam but i dont know why they are so underrated

Played. https://www.youtube.com/@Everybody-Loves-Honey
Stokes knows how to place fields perfectly thus getting the wickets
Robinson is a talented bowler but his fitness is a concern as a professional athlete
NZ fired so many bouncers to broad in revenge. Broad coming on his feet off the field is a mystery
Where is jofra 🎯
is that rubber ball
I don't understand why Stuart broad didn't want to play on Pakistan and now he's playing here. It's such double standards by cricketers these days.
Robinson is Mr beast
NZ doing well with a B bowling attack
Well played newzealand im a great suppoter of u

These two sides' clash is really something great ✌️💞
Great game great ground, well done to NZ for getting back in the game. The ground looks great with the grassy bank all the way round, a great venue for a day night game. Have just been watching Australia in India, playing on a ground covered in a haze of pollution, the stadium being a concrete monstrosity with the crowd sitting behind a grid of metal fencing. You couldn’t get more of a contrast. How long are Broad and Anderson going to play on for, both have had such a lengthy career.
Beautiful weather, crowd watching on grass, good cricket,game in the balance, great watch 👍 😁
Wagner is better off with old ball defo not with newer one
Bring blundell,wagner&kugernnel in every 3 format of game....you have to do that....rather then downfall of blackcaps
Without boult black caps not win
Make 20 min highlights mother fuckers🤬
OH NO bright sunny weather today  ....... poor CLOUERSON only got 1  wicket !!! 😢😭😭😭😭
I think "Mr cricket" nickname must be passed on from the legend Michael Hussey to the upcoming batting legend Devon Conway. What a career he has had till now.
Sorry but this day /night test cricket is not Test Cricket! Its more like 4 x50over matches where who is bowling when the light fails has the upper hand .. cracking innings from the NZ wicket keeper 👏 I just can't take this pink ball seriously 🙄
@primevideoindia kuchh to Sharm Karo..where is ind vs aus.
Anderson is 🐐
England.  This is newziland not pakistan hold on
You missed loads of boundaries from Blundell after his hundred

https://youtube.com/@simranabdulvlogs5848
England are at least one bowler short with Anderson now needing careful handling and Broad not the force he was. Woakes and Archer should be here.
If nz had either of boult or lockie the game would have been more evenly poised..
A team who shows off their brand of cricket as so called fearless cricket, feared to send Root on the crease when the EOD was near. LOL 🤣🤣🤣
Love this commentary side the ones in Australian matches is  so cringe!!!
England are playing unbelievable test cricket I think no team in the world can play like them💥💥💥
Poor shot selection by Blundell, could have taken a lead if he had played for longer period of time
The Nighthawk!!!
why u guys block thses vids in pak?
Pink ball seems to travel quicker off the bat than the red ball. If NZ can restrict England to lead of 225-230, things could get interesting. More than that, England would romp home comfortably.
Love the positive attitude shown by both sides in this match. A result is guaranteed if the weather holds and that is always the best result, no matter who wins.
I can't understand y England approach play like 50 over cricket test match beauty is play like test
https://youtube.com/shorts/CwEdPVqI81A?feature=share
Thanks prime video for amazing match highlights
Miss  Trent  bolt ⚡
Eng score 178-7 day 3 🙄🙄🙄🙄
India score 75-4 day 2 😁😁😁😁 Virat 55 run 7 fours 🙏🙏🙏
New Zealand keeps producing top wicket keeper batsmen... McCullum, Watling and now Blundell
Tom blundel..he just Loves batting under pressure..he has produced lot of magical Innings bt this is right up there...single handedly brought back NZ into the game else they were almost gone..
Nz what a come back one man army  blundell sar🥰🙏💯🖤
Bhujiya-ball will get ripped apart by Bangladesh alone, hehehe.
crawley is kl rahul of england.
Why no show of the dropped catch of “nighthawk” Broad? A true chuckle brothers moment
blundel good one
Blundell saved from collapse many times in these days
Great day of cricket. Eng Vs NZ and Aus Vs Ind well done
Day 2 80.5 Overs 348 Runs 9 Wickets
plz release longer highlights, so many of Blundell's boundaries missed
Where is jamieson????
Blundell has been so underrated
Wow England are making test cricket look like ODI and T20 cricket with the pace that they are scoring, they might even declare their 2nd innings tomorrow 😂😏💯🔥
I think devin Conway will be the best player in all formats for newzealand after some years 👍
Tickner looks perfect newzeland citizen😁
Outstanding Blundell🔥
Piz ind vs aus test
Csk fan seeing match with so happy and sad (stokes bowl and conway out!😭)     NB:I am csk Fan 💛💛💛
I still don't see what Leach offers this side
What if Rohit Sharma get this ground..?
Beautiful match. But England team spoiled the whole test team format......
Gill,Sky,Iyer,Dussen,Conway Brook,these all are new to International cricket but have looked comfortable since debut Amazing players they are Edit: I forgot Tegnarine from WI he also has shown potential in his debut series
in my opinion nz doesn't have that fire in there bowling department due to unavailability of boult, Jamison,matt henry
I have say this many times in the past and I'm saying this again Devon Conway is the best all format batsman right now
BLUNDELL worthy successer of WATLING!!!
Rishab Pant and Tom Blundell - Two are the best Wicket keeper Batters of Test sides. Very impressive and another valuable contribution from this Man. Well played!👏
https://youtube.com/shorts/xQCxuvoB9ek?feature=share
Bhencho nz aur eng se jyada to ye match indians dekh rhe h😂😂
and delhi and india have polluted weather
Has Trent Boult retired from cricket ??   He is the best bowler in Kiwi lineup ...without him the side is too weak to reach test championship finals
BazBall approach does not work , DEAR ENGLAND, NEW ZEALAND IS NEITHER PAKISTAN nor they have FLAT HIGHWAY PITCHES like Pakistan to improve stats of individual Players, I Want Ben stokes & CO  to play Bazball on turning pitches of Kanpur, Lucknow, Chennai. Newzealand played proper Cricket still got decent score on board Tom Blundell & other few players of Newzealand ensured England get literally Zero Benefit of that Bazball approach, at the end all english players looked frustrated BENSTOKES lets see if you have same guts to declare even in 2nd innings
Mitchell should've reviewed.
james anderson this man fitness level top notch he can play till next ashes in australia 2025 great legend bowler i dont think any fast bowler will come close to his wickets tally at all
England 😍😍
Williamson is struggling nowadays he should be retiring from all forms of cricket
NZ has beautiful grounds  NZ has cool and calm players New Zealand is just PERFECT.
This test >>>> ind vs aus
Most exciting match by England and New Zealand Not IND vs AUS 😉
Ollie Robinson is a massive flog
Darrell Mitchell and Neesham is a waste player for NZ 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Broad as "Nighthawk" new term in cricket 🏏 arena ♥️💯
From where is that applauding and cheering sound coming 😄😄 Ohh they have put microphones near crowd Come to asia to see real fanbase
Conway 🔥 is so talented ♥️💯
Where is Kyle Jamieson
Ham rahte to stuard broad ko 6 ball me 10 six Marta .
A fine ton by Tom Blundell. It kept New Zealand in this game on day 2
મેચ ભારત વચ્ચે ચેમ્પિયન બનશે પ્રાર્થના જીત માટે પ્રાર્થના કરે છે
England playing very attacking game...
Eng lose this match
What is this bazball In actual this is mentality of indian gully cricket  Nothing new and shocking  in this
Crawley Crawley Crawley…
Tom blundle's knock is quite similar to Virat Kohli's 149 in Edgbaston..... Century with tail enders in pressure situation
Where is blundell's quickfire after 100??
50/50
What a beautiful day for test cricket❤
Tommy Blundell brilliant batting son 😀
Missing boult😔😔😔😔
Blundell boundaries after 100 should have been added more..
England bazball can survive in India i don't think so 🤣🤣🤣
Blundell saved this
This series > current BGT 🙌
Kiwis are going to win either way
Hey Kiwis please stop Englands bazball .
Cricket win 🏏❤
I hope New Zealand wins this match
New Zealand
Jamieson bolut Southi kha h
NZL🖤
Lovely test match with beautiful stadium 🙂
Good Innings by Conway and Blundell 👍👍
Why it is not live telecasted in prime?
Perfact test match wicket ....
Well played Blundell and Conway ♥️
Trent boult miss you
Nice innings from blundell but new Zealand will need to play exceptionally well to win this test match
Stokes is never wrong with his field placements. Even though the batsman is attacking he will make sure atleast 5-6 fielders are around the circle. This Eng side doesn't care about the result.
England ka Attacking mode reason lose england
New Zealand win
Blundell and Conway makes recovery for newzealand  But the masterplan of stokes to get Conway out was spectacular 🔥
https://youtu.be/uIITPduhaP0
Stokes & Mcullum be like: apne hi Desh ko pelna alag hi mza hai🫠😅😅
Poore din ki highlight sirf 8 minute ki sharm aayi video upload karte huye ya nhi
I expected better from Amazon Prime Video. The highlights aren't just cut better enough to provide us all the action of the entire day. So so many Boundaries are missing, players are randomly jumping from 40 to 80 without us showing what happened.  Please Prime Video upload some better quality highlights for us Cricket Fans🙏🙏
Why are the full highlights not available for prime video UK?
Super nice super💕👌💕👌💕👌
Olie Pope technique similar like Ian Bell
Bahut hi acha hai❤😍❤😍❤
Come to India for baseball 😅😅😅😅😅 your baseball becomes Dead ball
NZ to Mccullum be like: *Saala jiss thaali mein khaaya, ab usi mein chedd kar rha hai* 😂😂🤣🤣
James Anderson is 100 times better than bumrah .....
Sad to see that 2 batsmen of the Fab 5 (Root & Kohli) are struggling with poor form in test cricket. Root needs to start batting again at no.3
wha Brandam Mchulam The Bazbaall
In IPL 🏏 Conway Form Will Be Help To Chennai Super Kings 👑
😍😍😍😍
That Was Sad Moment  Williamson 🥶 Vs Anderson 🥵
New Zealand 🇳🇿 Were Struggling 83/5 To 306/10 Because Of Blundell 138* & Conway 77* Help To Reach A Score
England play test cricket top level....
Tom Blundell plays the real Bazball today😎😍.... Sensational innings by the way.
Black cap win. Nz.
Devon Conway 💛
Two South Africans representing New Zealand started the day as the two batters against the team of a New Zealander representing England 😂😂😂🤣🤣🇳🇿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇿🇦
Blundell is a batter typically suited for test cricket. He's a kind of batter who sticks to the pitch and it's difficult to get rid off him. He's Watling, Hussey, type batter who with tailenders can make the scoreboard ticking without panicking. In terms of batting with tailenders, Kiwis got one of the best batter, if not the best one.
Why New Zealand Not Played Henry??
Blundell did it after 5 years scoring century at home after this many years is a great feeling. And he definitely gonna put this inning on top.
Leach Again Great Bowling 😃
Look at the Olie Robinson reaction
Stuart broad and Jimmy Anderson Goat 🐐
❤️❤️😘
Well played Devon Conway 👏👏👏
Brilliant century Tom Blundell
England win 🦁🦁🦁
🥰😇
England win the test series 2-0
Prime video worst cricket telecast and also worst provider of match highlight I can't find much shots of ghis match
Come on England 🦁🦁🦁

What an Innings from Tom Blundell(138 runs). He played exceptional and was the saviour of NZ team and batted well in such a tough situation. Same goes to Conway also for scoring good runs(77 runs) 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Stokes is best
Ajay
🧿🧿
After Watling it's Blundell show of Taking responsibility & Bat Long 🔥. This 138 has proved his ability to keep the team Afloat in a Tough situation. Well Played 👏
Blundell always Ignored with Contributions by Williamson, Conway & Mitchell but now he stood apart with 138 against Fierce pace attack of England 🔥.
Devon Conway Sir Is Not Simply Batting 💥 , He Is Just Living In His Representative Team And Scoring Consistently Winning The Team 😍
