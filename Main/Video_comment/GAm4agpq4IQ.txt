Yes, the cap is vented on the reservoir.
Rudy is now "THE MAN" as he rescued the man.......
I see an ale 8 bottle! That’s locally made where I’m from!
Is the rudican better than the banana, or is it the driver
Rudy, while we all appreciate your effort to branch off on your own, it is important to remember to be humble and grateful for the support and assistance you have garnered from your father.  Without him your 250k followers would be closer to 25-250 followers.  Word around town is that you have told your family that you could have done this on your own, but you are wrong.  Such attitude simply makes you look ungrateful, as most people do not have the privilege you have been favored with.  Some people just don't have the entrepreneur capability and require something like an inheritance to make it all work.  Don't be ashamed, but also don't get ahead of yourself..
I 've seen the video just now, but I have a question you maybe now can answer even more accurately: You installed that clear plastic hose, i guess to check the fluid level. It had no steel wire reinforcement  or such. Did it survive the year of pressure and temperature, or did you upgrade after it maybe blew, melted or somehow failed? I did my own tank for my Holiday Rambler RV with a Cummins, and did some research before I installed a hose , able to take 220 PSI and 250° Fahrenheit, but im still checking every time I drove .
should install shut off valves for the tubing sight glass incase hose breaks
What did I miss, why don’t I see Rudy in Matt’s videos anymore?
I'm hooked on your channel bud!  Ya got sum gumption man!!!  I dig how you have gone on your own!  Well done !!!!
Love your videos! Great to see you rescuing your Dad 1
SolidWorks for the win! Brother ✊
I'm  impressed of your GO, and I like that you are making your ovn business, and I lIke that your brothers are with you, go on brothers!!!
Such a dope video. Loved the reservoir
Just started watching your channel, but I had no idea your dad was Matt’s recovery. I’ve seen him a lot on bleepin’s channel. Cheers!
👍👍👍👍
Never run over a recovery rope.  It's bad ju ju.
Got to love an xj!
I totally enjoyed today's video I think I might have seen it before probably not exciting and make sure you have your Mom watch this she could learn something from Janelle instead of wearing them flip-flops when she goes into a Jeep Janelle's well warrants cowboy boots look like the ideal shut up until they feel full of sand LOL
It's wild to me that they don't make better tow points on side x sides Love your channel!
Nice Solidworks skills!
Rudy you did a better job building your jeep than your dad did the banana
What happens with you and your dad? In this video, there are few frames in which you can barely see his face ...
Most have a vent, like the work
That is a very nice can. Great job on the design and assembly!!! Keep up the great work!!
Nice of you to rescue your dad.  I hope you gave him a shirt.
The dog breathing on that incline sounded like a lifter tick lol
Anytime You are welding, cutting, grinding, or drilling, you must be wearing eye protection.
Jenelle you are very much appreciated, these vids are great & its awesome to see you two together on recoveries.
Amazing build Rudy, you have a gift my friend, makes me wish I took auto shop more seriously as a kid!!! lol. How did you come to have such an amazing shop full of tools and welder at a very young age??
I love it mannnnn!!!keep em coming!!!!😂👍🏿
Is this ya'alls shop or are you borrowing a shop. Just curious?
Hahahaha.   Of course
Rudy to the rescue
Use your plas table to make your bend marks.  That way you don't have to lay them out by hand.
i would love to have one of them hats you were Rudy
Yaaaay !!!
Honestly, Rudy's girlfriend has the best camera work of any of the three channels I watch, Matt's off-road rescue, fabrats and Robbie Layton.
Still a little unsure why you wouldn't just use a plastic reservoir and save the time and the weight...
Awesome
Rudy ROCKS!!!!
Never realized Rudy was such an ham. Also a skilled young machinist
Keep an eye on the water  electrolysis with that added metal to your cooling system. I do like the hexagon you made nice bends.
I didn’t know you had your own channel. It’s good to be here
The plasma cutter cnc is cool.
Man, that is fascinating country.  The legacy, I believe, of the Great Pangaean Range.
Hey why was that thing sounding like chitty chitty  bang bang?
Im sorry dude ... But your welding skills are a bit lacking 🤕
I noticed you have an Ale8one connection. I grew up in KY drinking those.
How did the banana get stuck , and how did you connect that tank you made?
The coolant tank needs to breathe so the level can go up and down without causing pressure or vacuum. Just a small hole in the cap would do.
Are not apart of Matt’s recovering anymore ??
Rudys jeep is the best for sure who agerees
Dang Rudy i’m all caught up on your videos now what?
Nice videos.
ah... so that's how he got out! Thanks.
Nice rescue Rudy 👍
Murphy says: Metal fatigue will break the coolant tank mtg bracket.
wow nice.
Very good!!! I liked!!!
It's amazing to see the Rudicon planted so firmly as it hoisted up the sand rail.
Bro, that logo you drew up is RAD!
Why don’t you do more videos
Gha again rudy
I'm diggin' the chick. She's a keeper Rudy.
Awesome over flow  tank!!!!Do you edit your own videos
@12:18... She says: "It's Pretty Steep"... So I click on "Enter Full Screen"! 😮😮 @13:14... Poor Skeeter! 🥵🥵 @14:18... Down is FUN! Up, SUCKS!!!
Thats pretty nice, maybe a little big. But awesome job👍
Jenelle is a cutie.👍
Finally came over from you Dad's page, good job getting him out...............................
Hi Rudy,  Seems like your channel is growing pretty fast. Keep up the good work and just be amazing. God Bless!
You should do more colabs with your dad.  I bet your subs had a boost today.
Excellent jerb on the reservoir tank... and another successful rescue of dad...  The '1/2 Dun' is coming along nicely 👍   Thanks 🙏🏻 for sharing
great video, nice tank. what all does RAD do besides making cool stuff for your jeep? thanks for saving your dad.
👍
I get that this is a fab channel but you can get way better radiator overflow cans off of Scamazon for peanuts and then the time could have been spent working on something worthwhile, or you could have found an appropriate wrecker part. Oh well you learn by doing things I guess.
Love the vid but FYI, flat faced dogs really struggle to keep cool. Your Boston sounds like a train. Not a good breed to have hang out in the heat.
Rudy, my man, it looks like your designing is the adventure.....lol
!RAD
So you have your own channel also!! Thought I was caught up!! Very good..
You gonna keep them name 1/2 Dun?
Morr* videos por favor!!! Good stuff.
Rudy great job but a 10 in. piece of 8 in. stainless pipe would have saved you 90% of the work and looked just as nice. Also you could have bought preformed ends.
Do you have an English wheel yet??
Fantastic Yall!!
Where is your new video Rudy?
good
Nice work on the coolant reservoir.  Could double as a massive oil catch can with some internal baffles and wire mesh LOL.
Good day" RUDY . . . 👍👍😊
Awesome , both.
Awesome job on the reservoir!
One guy standing at a drop off looking down is not a good sign.
oh man that is sweet, didn't realize he was your pops. There are SOOOOO many people trying to capitalize their videos using Matt's channel these days, it's is hard to know who is legit, and who is looking for views.
Rudy, Rudy, Rudy! I hope you're wearing hearing protection when you're using power tools. That's why manly men who are 50 can't hear anything--power tools in their 20's without ear protection.
Great recovery job well done, make a dad proud!!! Thanks for sharing the adventure, that was some hill but not as bad as the hill with the tower on it.
They've been coming up with some very clever videos they just happen to be in the area so they got a call to come and get about I've been to that same Hill many times in those little razors or whatever can make it every time just got to do a video got to do it
There's a guy from Arizona that has a nice home made AC that is great for tailgating. It won't cool the entire jeep down but you can have it blow on you while you work.
That looked a bit too much for this old man. Glad you got 'em all out safely.
10:00 Holy Hair Batman!!! 😳🤪😁🤣
Wait? Rudy has his own channel? How did I not know this?
Enjoying watching the Rudicon progression. Has to be a pretty good compliment when Matt calls you for help,even though you know it's gonna be a tough job😉
Nice design on the reservoir nothing gives you a better feeling than tried and true
Nice shop!!
Is that a returnable ALE8 bottle… all the way out in Utah‽
Should have just used an old wd-40 can. Why didn't you drill the holes b4 welding?
Nice to see that Rudy does the same stupid things that I do... burn myself,  grab the wrong bit, but it's all part of the fun
Rudy use the plasma table to make ED a custom front plate for the nugget . Maybe a custom key chain too. Make a metal horse for lizzy for her birthday or carismas to hang on her wall she would love that .
how are you going to keep it from rusting is it stainless ??
Oops,   Measure twice cut once. 🤣😂
Big fan of  your Dad's channel. This was hard to watch. That asinine background music was more than I could take.
The music : Ruuuuudeee!!!!!
So what broke when we heard the bang? no mention later on.
Tidy job 👍 Might have done three sides with each end, but that's just a personal thing for making it easier to bend.  With the 'rescue', if you could drive round, why not do that in the first place?
Glad to see that all of your family is strong and that you help everyone including your customers.
If you're gonna bring your French bulldog out in weather over 85°,  you need to bring something to cool their body. Little thing was panting like crazy!
I love the less edited video style like this. Watch any  "big" Youtuber, your dad included, and watch their early videos, it's real!!
Are you doing your own thing now Rudy? I haven't seen you on Matt's off road in a while
You are a machinest?
Sheet metal worker? Fabricator.
Rudicon is soo beefy!!!
You mean you got a call from your Dad? and I'm thinking an old coffee can would have worked a little faster. Just saying.....
Wait!!! Matts your dad?!?!? Mind blown
since when does Rudy have a channel
Perfect timing!
I like this I finally found Rudy's show yay
Is that your own shop? At first I figured you work there but you seem to be doing quite a bit of your personal work there so was wondering.
I think RAD should stand for "Rudy Aided Design"
We'd all like to know what the fee is when Dad makes a call LOL
Never Done
What’s your honest though on the badlands winches. My son has a 04 grand with a 4in long travel life on 33s with a Goliath bumper setup for a winch that we take to the sand dunes when we’re out with our atvs and he’s thinking of doing a recovery vehicle but is not sure what winch he wants to go with.
You live & work in such beautiful part of the US.  Just amazing scenery.  Great fab work on the Rig too Rudy !
Great job w coolant box and awesome job on recovery, ottis panting in back round made me hot .lo👍🇺🇸
How long before this recovery tank rusts out? Why didn't you fabricate it out of Aluminum?
18:52 that engine does not sound good.. maybe a vacuum leak?
Nice work Rudy.  The Morrvair is laughing.  Miss you on your dad's site
Hey Rudy what program are you using to draw with? Looks like solidworks? That is what I use here at my work, Been doing Cad for the last 30 plus years.
"The family that trucks together, gets unstuck together"
It's awesome you make a point to wear your safely glasses.
Cool video & recovery 😁. I hadn't realized you had your own channel, should have known,lol. Thanks for Posting.
I captured captain Morgan's parrot ..I put him in the cage he was a yellow belly sea wench , didn't want to tell me where was the Captain's gold ... So a ringged his neck till he started to sign language something.. he said that the captain drank the rum, and buried the gold ..but asked for one thing ...he signed language for a cracker...So I got him a cracker, after his cracker I repeated were was the gold , he said he was drunk too and don't remember..
What about it rusting from the inside out?
Awesome video! Great work!
Competition... 😀😀😀
nice going.  that's a good enough reason for me to always have an extra 75' of winch rope extension with me.
Good job pulling out the LEMON.
So you're not going to just whack away at some steel plate with an angle grinder, welder, and eyecrometer? You're actually, like, measuring and stuff?? That's a strange way to fabricate.  😂
Janelle, truly the Mistress of Understatement. "That's pretty steep" It's always nice how she sums everything up and always looks like 'we should be working'.  Nice fab job on the overflow tank and great job on the recovery
I might have missed something why are you no longer with your dad's company?
I thought that dog panting was a noise your jeep was making lol.
Matt aka Dad made a call!
Rudicon and the Banana working together like they should do! Just like Matt and Rudy!! Good I missed this!!!
I like that reservoir. But as soon as you called it a “can” all I could imagine is how cool it’d be to make it from a large tin can of beans or a coffee can or something.
I'm throughly impressed with the overflow tank fab work 👌
"The battery which is mounted in the back." I think the term "mounted" is a stretch, and having a battery inside your vehicle, with a bag of conductive shackles on the seat above it is just asking for an explosion.
that is the coolest looking overflow reservoir ever Rudy! What a shakedown run! Looked super steep and very hot. Keep up the great videos Rudy!
At that angle I questioned who would dare back back up it.  Glad to see the other side came around.
Was thinking, would motorcycle tank sealant be a good idea for the inside, so it doesn't rust or anything like that?
Could totally sell those metal RAD plates.
Takes some talent to get stuck going down hill!  Good entertaining video!!
Fueling up??  Before going out on a rescue??  How unlike your Dad!!  Whew!  That was a long pull, and what a slope!  Got everyone out, though - good job!
I like the sun/safety glasses while running the plasma cutter and grinder.
Love if!
Awesome recovery buddy!! Also I thought that the catch can for your radiator definitely looked good and hopefully worked out good for you also!!! A catch can is also something that I’m needing to add to my 1969 Chevy 1Ton 4x4!! I haven’t had any issues yet though with out one!! But definitely need to get one put in!! Just all the little things can definitely take for ever!! Well Rudy awesome video buddy and remember keep up all the hard work buddy!!!
That gas tank drives me crazy man
Oh you know you can rub that in, getting your dad out :P
Great job Rudy, did your dad break another front axle?
Mate... please use ear protection when grinding etc... I have a bit of deafness now cause of not wearing muffs... its not worth it. Love the vids and Hello from New Zealand
What part of Utah? It is gorgeous!
Most plasma CNC controls have a option 5o cut a hole starting from center. So you can mark your center and place the torch on the mark and cut the hole. May be easier than drilling.
good job rudy..
Why did you make the reservoir so large?
Nice!
Best Rudy content yet. Feels like you are finding your own voice with this one. And Jenelle and Otis are integral to that voice.
Wow, got it done just in time.
Test the leaks with gasoline.
Nice bro👍
Nice reservoir!  The clear vinyl hose may work for a while but the heat from the radiator will soften it and cause it to break. There is similar hose with string webbing in it that should work.
I see u are wearing ur RAD T Shirt are u selling them as a Pro mo 🤔
What this really shows is how damn good that blue painters tape is.
That's the most jank battery setup lol
Love that family stuff. Thanks  And yea camera never shows how  steep the trail actually is.
#49 on Trending. Cool.
How come Rudy says "Measurements" properly and Matt doesn't?   ( sounds like 'masurement') :)
Please tell me you gave him a shirt lol
You just got a subscriber.😀 actually i thought i was already subscribed.🤷😁
Rudy - are you completely out of the MORR channel now? I mean other than rescuing your dad.
Great content!
Pretty cool reservoir well finished. Great job rescuing your dad.
Great job guys!

Really wish i had your setup an knew how to run it i have always wanted a plasma table or water jet never could afford one
Steep Slope on that one.
2:16 - I don't know this arm.
Don't you want to teach CNC usage to Paul ? 🤣 9:03 Like father, like son 😋 By the way, nice job Rudy, you looked so proud that your dad ask you for the rescue :D
Rudy has more fabrication machines than Matt n do know more about it
Glad to see a Linux logo once i user Linux cnc
Batman has a light, Rudi has a phone. lol
Rudy will probably give Matt a shirt for Christmas
Cameras usually don’t do justice for the incline but we could definitely see it here!
Great job Rudy, that Rudicon is a monster!
Should have bought a prefab
What kind of rope do you use in your winch?
Wow, controlling the machine with Linux, cool! I guess there is software to do that after all.
18:53 I thought it was a pulley... Then remembered the dog 😅
A bit of an explainer video about the workshop would be interesting, is it yours or are you using a friends? Are you doing fabrication work there as well or just YouTube?
The reservoir turned out good, nice little side project
Was that just regular water?
Nice to see you doing a recovery "With" dad, Sucks not seeing you on his Channel!  #BuiltByBo
Great job Rudy . What a beast.
good job, both the reservoir and saving your Dads ass! Nicely filmed and edited.
love ittt..... halfff off halfs!!! Cheers
Matt made a call! Nice work.
It is surprising how many humans do not feel they have the divine right to experience an abundant life. This is so sad, when you consider that true abundance isn't something bought, or given, it is something that is shared. Till at last we rise forever in the arms of perfect love.
rudddyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What is the recovery fee when you have to go recover the recovery guy?
That battery in the passenger compartment is really really not a good thing. Please box that in and put a vent on it.
Matt's off road recovery recovery..  Good job 👍🏼👍🏼
A  $12.99 cheapie generic one at Carquest is not bullet proof...I will build one say's a real-man.  I always wanted to see him have his own channel.  I'm glad to watch his channel grow maybe meet/visit one day!!!
Where did you get an ALE-8?
Your dad still doesn't have that Dana  60 in the front end of that thing !
Good job on the CNC and the welder!!!🤙
Probably already said but would have been much easier to put the holes in prior to welding it up.
I enjoy watching your progress! How much you selling the reservoirs for? ;)
Also, if you are going to be mig welding threaded bungs; you need to be threading the plug, or whatever fitting into the bung while you weld it so that it serves two functions. One, to act as a heat sink to keep the bung as cool as possible. And two, to keep the bung from warping as much as physically possible while you're pouring all that heat into it.   You need to learn to tig
YO what the hell???? Who's burn table is that????
One way I learn that get rid of the air in the cooling system after you fill up the radiator take off the top hose fill it up with water and a failed safe thermostat it let water flow into the block I think check one out
We need more of Otis.
Sorry to say this Rudy, but, Lizzy is a better welder than you..
Rrruuuuddddyyyyy you forgot the spoiler alert..  cuz i guess this video is coming on your dad's channel. 🤣😉
Jesus Christ loves us and wants us to repent  https://youtu.be/RQL_Pq-1hqM
Don't run over the rope.
The plasma cutting machine! Is it an Esap? Worked for 25 years for a KOIKE Europe in holland. So have some experience in cutting and cutting machines. Now i am retired and Enjoying the videos from off road recovery thanks for these. Also 👍Matt, paul,Rory,bleep jeep those guys does some good and difficult work there in Utah. Greetings ✋️👍🌞😎
Super nice car. But you should protect your ears. Trust me. Too much noise will give you tinnitus and thats a living hell.
Interesting to see your creativity come out with this build, from an oversized DIY roof hatch to a custom coolant reservoir, it's been interesting seeing the work that goes into the Rudicon.
You need to come up with a Matt signal or an emogee for cell phones in the shape of Matt's beard.
I love the background engine noise (hot dog breath panting)!!!
You just made my 4 July great it about time matt got STUCK!
That looks really good nice job
Is their going to be a new shirt i got a call to tow dad out ?
Good work Rudi.  The reservoir is quite cool.  Nice!
great job! That angle!!!!
argh!!! that drill press should be running under 1000 rpm for a 1 inch hole @6:50 somewhere around 700 with sharp tools   I want you to go to titans of cnc and do all the courses.
Rudy, great videi!  I did a whole lot of engineering work on engine coolant flow and testing.  We first tried using clear vinyl hose.  Terrible idea.  That clear hose will not hold the heat.  Our fix was to use traditional rubber hoses with clamps and a glass tube.  Glass makes it easy to see what's going on and will definitely contain the heat.  Good luck with  the build!
Awesome fabrication work. Keep up the great work and videos coming.
Nice build on the reservoir!!!!! It looks good and works well and great job on getting your Dad out.☺️☺️☺️👍👍👍👍
Happy, Safe And Blessed July the Fourth🎆😇🇺🇸
'The Winds of Change'😎 LOL🌟
that microphone looks uncomfortable to wear, rip the neck on all your shirts :D
Touch my camera through the fence!
I seen the ale 8 in the background i live in Kentucky where it is made . and i love it that is all i drank. Happy 4th of July.
Nice 👍
you should weld in a cross brace on those purple supports. tie a piece of string* and go off roading, lets see the flex in the frame      *that does not stretch like (a strand of a synthetic winch cable is the same stuff if you have that) lash-it-zing-it
Hey brother. At the end there was a drone shot. I know it's a pain In the ass, but.. you should send it up more often for b roll. Great video
As a fellow Utahn, thanks for representing us Rudy! You and your duel Canadian citizenship are great ambassadors. We live in a beautiful state, albeit dry, but a great place to be in this lifetime.
Ale8 in UT?  I wish we could get it.   Love the spicy Ginger dew.
I didn’t see your weld a bung in for the radiator overflow tube, I must have blinked. Great video.
More lies from Schifty Schiff is running ads on this video.  Schiff is a POS!
Great fabrication work as always Rudy. Did Matt really snap another U joint or axle?
We are enjoying your videos Rudy.  I liked watching you design and cut the parts.
Do you guys own the machine shop ?
Now you’re supposed to give him a T shirt right? 🤷🏻‍♂️
So next do we see the Rudicon get painted?
@6:30, When I was a rookie machinist an old guy walked by and looking at my setup said, "One clamp is not a clamp."  "What is it then?", I asked.   His answer has stayed with me for 30 years. He said, "It's a pivot."
Rudy, great soup to nuts video of day-in-the-life of you & your shop's activities!
Nice logo!  Have you got merch for sale yet?
Did Matt talk you into filing a fraudulent insurance claim?
Rudy, if you tell me the size of the threads on your drill press quill, and the diameter of the knob, I think I can locate a knob to replace the missing one. I have a nice collection of them I take to the flea market each August. They don't seem to get smaller in quantity as I keep finding more at scrap yards.
Y'all can just take turns pulling each other out every other day and people will watch
You did a good job on putting the motor in the rudicon
Great job!! Btw,, Jenelle is so beautiful 👌😍
Great to see you getting your rig sorted, and back out doing recoverys, all the best to yous and your loved ones
I've noticed you're tower cross tube hasn't been connected for a bit. Any reason?
Great job on the recovery and video.
Great job Rudy. So if I missed it do you have a design degree or just life’s schooling? Either nice.
It won't be The Rudicon if it's all done, there's always room for new ideas and improvements, trials and tribulations, triumph and desperation. I'm glad to be here, MORR is still good but I miss your cheerful it'll-be-fine-disposition. It's a flashback to my younger self before my life became overshadowed by chronic depression and anxiety 24/7. 👍
🤙🏽🤙🏽
you guys are nuts things yall do for fun good thing you all look out for one another....nice fab work!!!
wow, then you added brass to the system. I hope you don't have the problems I've run into with cooling systems and mixing different  metals.  Some builds have had close to 3 volts in the coolant after a few months of running. Crazy eh?
I miss playin with a plasma table. I've been wanting to get a smaller table with the THC on it. I think that option is the best ever.
Can't belive no-one said it yet. But that's a RAD coolant tank ;)
Always nice to rescue dad from time to time. Great job on the reservoir.
seems like you should have made out of stainless or aluminum to keep electrolysis to a minimum.
Harbor Freight should pay you for the wench advertising 😂
Hay Matt! Looks like Rudy knows about putting on safety goggles 🥽
Cool design!! Any concerns of the tank rusting?
Many people don’t realize that bending metal on a bender takes skill. It’s a feel, it’s the accuracy, it’s the patience to learn
I actually do miss Rudy on Matt's channel but I'm glad he has this one tho
How RAD is that?  Keep up the good work.
Like father like son. You also have some crazy skills
So Who shop is that you’re working in Rudy ?? America 🇺🇸 💪🏼🤙🏼🔧🔩
GLAD TO SEE UR TECH SAVVY AND SAFETY SMART!!
Nice work on the tank. When running that drill press you may want to remove your gloves. Just like with a lathe or a mill, wearing gloves can cause you to get pulled onto the machine. No gloves or loose clothing when running manual machines.
Great video Rudy! I am glad to see that you don’t edit out all the stuff that happens to all of us in the shop!👍👍👍👍
"it is tomorrow now" what? No, today is today
Good Job Rudy!
What did you charge them?
cutting the hole in the flat piece before ya weld it on keeps metal flake out of the tank , eh?
Okay, Rudy, I saw an Ale81 bottle in the first part of the video. How in the heck did you get that all the way out there? I'm an old Kentucky boy, and grew up with that stuff. Now that I live in Michigan, I have to bring back cases of it whenever I go back home.
Hey Rudy, wouldn’t you want a pressure relief cap on the new degas tank?  (just thinking about some of the factory set-ups I’m familiar with) I think it keeps it from over-pressurizing if it happens to over heat, wouldn’t want to blow a hose off or split the rad.
Pleas tell me your going to put a clamp on the site tube
You need a over flow thanks for sharing 👍😀
Steep indeed!
Nice fab job. Thanks for the video
Gotta have a win sometimes, good result.
You need to be careful mounting the battery inside the passenger compartment due to venting - if that's where it's going to finish up.
That is what a good son and father doe’s
You were on matt's your dad's channel a this time. Now all of a sudden you got  a call. LMAO
Man I don't know what got into you you're always happy but you're a little more happy than usual with that smile like a movie star oh wait you are a movie star 💯
I'm a Dad too....good to be able to help you Dad eh?..... I'm also a Dad with hearing aids, because I used a lot of high pitch  tools without ear plugs or ear muffs.... Great Videos Rudy....I live near Vancouver in the Okanagan Valley, maybe you got there when you lived in Canada....
i like the craftsmanship. this reminds me of my chopper days. guys would have some crusty stuff but have one really cool one off part everyone would geek out over.
Nice 🐂💩story
I thought the vehicle was running weird.. at the very end while he was watering his dog I realized it was the dog panting then entire time. 😵‍💫😵‍💫   Let me rephrase that.. I thought the Rudicon was running **ruff** but it was just the dog.
Well done Rudy 💖
Rudy  Just normal diesel in a plant spray squeezey thing, spray round, wait 5 minutes,  if you got a leak , it'll find it, trust me Much better than water.
why the sad opening music?  you guys do good things :)
is the best Rudi .regards from Indonesia
Half dun doing ALL dun level work
👍👍👍👍👍
So lucky he has you and your experience. The new Rudicon is a beast....That pop has to be getting old...Have a feeling a conversion is coming soon.
me: Rudy just made a coffee can (2 seconds later) Rudy: That was a lot of work to make a can
Thanks, you just helped me figure out what this metal box was that I found in some rocks at the beach, fluid reservoir from a boat that must have sunk offshore and the debris washed up. It had the same fittings and a level window. I was wondering what it was for and now I know.
Your dad seems like a cool guy.
great vid!
👍👍
"This should never be attempted at home....... CLANG......THUD" hahaha #nailedit
good job stay funny luv ur vids HAPPY 4 TH !!!
sweet design
damn that was steep, good timing finishing the reservoir .
G,day Rudy from Sydney Australia. The heavy wrecker would be ideal for that job? 🌏🇦🇺
So, what broke?
Excellent job on the reservoir Rudy and Saving Matt
👽~ 𝓒𝓸𝓸𝓵 𝓑𝓮𝓪𝓷𝓼 ~👽  ...430
👍👍Good one!
Boom !  Nice work !  Being there for each other is great  :- )  Nice welding on that too!
Gotta upgrade that axle, Matt… if only the days were just a few hours longer to make time for the improvements.
way to go Super Rudy and Super Jenelle
Rudy you got a cheapskate dad didn't even give you a t-shirt. And there was no weather report. Thank you for watching my comments.👌🏽👍🏽🤙🏾🤟🏽🙏🏽🌶😱😰😳🙌🏽✋🏽🤷🏽‍♂️🙋🏽‍♂️.
--------------------->  NVR DUN
At one moment i thought rudy was running a compressor because of the overpressure valve sound. 5 seconds later i see the dog hahaha
So steep! The camera doesn’t show it very well but holy cow!
Good work.
Good recovery Rudy
Rudy fueling up!?!? Fake news hahaha
Another great job Rudy.  Keep em coming!
Hey Rudy, how’s that badlands winch treating you? Worth the money?
Other names for your Jeep,half done , quarter done,Eighth done , sixteenth done ................... Battery location,you could go to two small batteries?eg : two 6volts in a space that leaves room to move ?
Great job Rudy!! You need to do more VLOG's!
Anyone else would just buy a generic overflow tank, lots of respect for saying forget that and building a cool and unique one from scratch!
The Rudicon strikes again…
Really nice work, Rudy. 💕
Great seeing you out again. And rescuing Dad no less 😂 Your logo cut out was a great idea. You should offer them for sale 😊
So this was the very first official call you have received. I was impressed I give you guys credit you define getting a workout on calls like that. Janelle did an amazing job behind the camera you two work good together
Great job on the tank, it will outlass everything else in the cooling system. I've often thought about how you and your Dad both are keeping the recovery vehicle in place while using the winch? Park gear in the transmission will only take so much before the pin snaps. The e brake works on the rear wheels and then thru the trans and driveline holds the front I assume. It just seems safer if the front brakes had a hydraulic line lock/valve to lock them separately. Or even 2 locks, one for front and rear just to be safe. It could get messy if one of the jeeps took off while pulling.
💛💛💛💛💛💛💛Thxs for sharing
Rudy, We love ya .🤣. You're a natural born comedian.. Don't do this at home.. I grabbed the wrong hole saw. Priceless..
Nice fab skills Rudy,  and a good rescue
Awesome! Started watching from your Dads videos. Love what you are doing, cool style and audio really good. Looking forward to the next one.
Rudy to the rescue lol
Great work Rudy.God bless.
Another awesome video.
Where’d you put the relief valve ?
That was quite the slope. Cool reservoir tank. I'm not sure i would have gone with mild steel but it'll probably last a long time. Wish i had a plasma table.
Well, that was fun and what success looks like. Much respect.
Good work, Rudy, both in the shop and out there in the field! Oh, thanks to your faithful sidekick Janelle!
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Rudy you and your Dad are true warriors and you both have ice water running through your veins. That was scary just watching it. 👀
Why not use a plastic reservoir off another jeep? Would have been easier and not rust. Not a good idea cutting the hole when already enclosed, it will leave metal shavings and smaller pieces in the reservoir. Should have drilled before enclosing.
Eye protection?  05:09
Good job always take care of pops
So RAD rapid assistance driver in this case that one loo,ed steep on camera so I can only imagine just how steep it actually was and nicework on that  Reservoir looks the goods. Matt seriously needs to build those new axles
I am very proud of you ! You are making a difference , remain humble my friend and you will continue to excell toward excellence.
How can we get the merchandise!?
Rudy to the rescue
lmfao. the same old gas tank. would have thought you'd have a sick custom built fuel cell by now
Rudy, ... you're using Linux ?? ... Ata Boy !!!
Family isn't everything, it's the only thing!
Where would Matt be without Rudy?
I was in a situation like this-- it was much steeper, but a dirt cliff-- not sand...   but we didnt' have enough rope, so I ended up using 100' extension cord..  It was close enough where I could wrap the cord around three times, and then tie it off... and it pulled the truck up the cliff, and didn't even break the cord;  we used it the next day.   If you try to use an extension cord as a straight single pull-- it will break quite easily, but loop it 3 times or more-- and it has enough copper there to not break.  Pretty cool.... I tied the ends with a bowline-- so it was easy to untie.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤟🏻
what hill that looks flat .. oh wait I just fixed my computer screen yes that's a hill lol .. will you need too coat the over flow tank  for rust ??
I am not sure that plastic site tube will hold up to the heat of the coolant, better have some kind of back up!  I stand corrected after watching the rescue video!
Or maybe never attempted at work. Lol 😆
That's one hell of a beast you've been building pretty impressive man! Be safe and God bless happy fourth.
Rudy the booty how's it going👍 You guys are awesome
WOO HOO!  Good job Rudy and Jenelle!
Howdy!
I like the creativity Rudy but I’d probably have just used a coffee can or something .. lol Nice work .. hope you guys have a great 4th
McMastercar
Like it
Do more videos with your dad.
No Matt interview!?🤷🏽‍♂️😩
Nice fab job!
I been watching your dad site for awhile just couldn't remember why you went on your own nothing wrong with that just wondering.
Why wouldn't you pressure test the tank before install?
So, your plasma table is run by a Linux Operating System??  Doesn't get any better than that!!!  You need to do an episode or 2 telling us about your new shop, where you learned cad, what kind of business you're doing outside of just working on the Rudi-Con...  I see huge amounts of steel, plasma table, computers (which I didn't know you were able to use), etc.
brush those welds with diesel on one side and if there is the smallest hole it will show up on the other side. about as good as pressure testing
That was a fun video, but walking up a steep hill with 2 feet of loose sand on top did NOT look fun! LOL I absolutely love your fabrication work! 🔥
I think the Rudicon being half dun has run it’s course! 🧐🙏☘️
That would be an awesome sledding hill!
Matt made a call. Hope he got a RAD shirt
And to think no one ran out of gas! It was a good day.
Nice job Rudy.💪👍👍
I have an ExTerra 2002.  The check oil light kept flickering on and off .and A/C not working so good.   has happened before----Filled radiator back up and ta da oil light off and A/C works.  Kinda like slamming back door to get toilet to flush
Love your videos and your designs
Please buy some greens
great job always enjoy the show
5:21 bro, who got you ale 8? I didn't think it got that far west.
That was awesome Rudy.  You knew exactly what to do.  👍👍👍👍    Have a safe and happy 4th.  God bless 👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️🌟🌟🌟🌟🙏🙏
Excellent
Rudy, you are an excellent welder! Have you dabbled with tig welding? That would have been cool to see that reservoir tig welded, but nonetheless, it still looks awesome. Great work Rudy!
How convenient 🙄
Nice improvement in audio. Keep up the great work.
You should hose clamp the fluid level hose!
I thought something was mechanically wrong with the jeep at the end there.  Like a fan or a pump out of balance.  It was the dog panting.  Ha.
Hi , Rudy.  Another great video . I was curious if the software on your plasma table was Linux cnc ?  I was also curious was  cad platform you use for design ? That's  cool Janelle comes along and helps and of course , Otis as supervisor 😀   when will you have the V8 ready to put back in ? Hope you guys have a happy fourth of July  . Take care gang and stay safe .  Terry
Love to see you working with your dad! At least it wasn’t to take him gas
Time to change the name to the RADicon
The camera gives it no justice to  how step the hill is.
Nice can. Sheet metal fabrication is awesome.
I see Tux ; is that program Linux ?
All the ladies in the dorm rec room wanted Rudy to take his shirt off when he was welding, I said that might kinda hurt, like when not wearing gloves. Like being attacked by little bees.
At least he didn’t run out of gas.
Ya know, if you are going uphill and ya got a rope next to you, you can use it to get up the hill easier, just saying.
Good job Rudy and co.
Rudy.  Yo.  Hi.
Wouldn't the inside rust and introduce it to the entire system?
Grinder.  I ❤️ it. Back in business 😎
Oh did he break another axle hahahahaha 😆
Thanks Guys
MORRDUN
You should of presented your dad with a shirt, he made the call.
I like your new logo, that’s rad, ha ha.
Nice job on that can...and it works which makes it even better! so ya got a call to help your dad and then get him out. Great days work ~ have a safe Forth . .Rudy, Jenelle and The wonder Dog Otis.
Awesome work as usual but thing im wondering is , does dad get a shirt since he made a call ?
Rudy how did dad feel giving you a call. And I think it is Awesome that you helped your dad out and you and your dad are Awesome
Your the man Rudy. Love seeing your work and rescues. Take care from Québec Canada
if you want to go really over the top cool/hightec, run the sight gauge hose into the cab, and have it readable on  dash
NEXT ON TO DO LIST FOR THE RUDYCON..FAB UP A GAS TANK. ☺☺☺😅👌
very creative use of tools to make a can! Did you considered buying a plastic one for about 20 bucks? Just wondering.
18:53 That engine doesn't sound too healthy... 19:35 Oh it was the dog! 😂
Just a tip. Diesel works really well for finding leaks. Works better then water
That background music is distracting and bites.
This guys voice sounds similar to that red bearded guy over at MORR. LOL
Did you give your dad a T-shirt?
Nice Work on the Tank, Rudy and the Bail-Out of your Dad too👍
Hey Rudy that expansion tank looks awesome. However I think that you may find that it needs a vent tube to function as and open cooling system like Chrysler intended. cheers! The rudicon is looking great
🇺🇲🦅Happy 4th Of July 🦅🇺🇲🍻🇺🇸🦅🦬
that's a lot of work to make a milk jug...
Rudy, half done , is better than halfass done. Keep on going, and build it to your vision.  Looks great from here. 👍
As someone once said, There are old pilots and there are bold pilots and there are no old bold piliots. Drill press operators.
Nice scenery to be driving thru
how will you keep the inside of the overflow tank from rusting?
RADS RECOVERY TO THE RESCUE!?!? $$?
Rudy…..way to represent Winchester Ky home of Ale8!!!! Love all your projects. Keep them coming. Send me your address low key and I’ll send you some authentic Ale8. Possible sponsor???? They are an awesome hometown company and sent me several cases while I was in Afghanistan. Have a wonderful 4th!!!!!
I missed something that shop is Rudy’s ?
Always love watching your welding/fabricating skills :-)
At 19:00 there seemed to be a strange knocking, or ticking noise coming that sounded like it was coming from the engine. But it's Otis!
Almost need a dry sump oil system when you are working on those kind of angles...?   Have a good 4th of July down there eh!
Great video. Man sometimes you sound just like your dad (that’s a compliment)!
That poor dog.  good grief 😲
Want more Otis!  HA!
dang old folks are always needing something it always feels great to be needed and able to help.inguess next thing youll be changeing diapers for the babys.time sure flys when your having fun
Nice Rudy! You're a damn genius, and seem to be very kind hearted to those in need, keep it up!
Well ! That sure was Different ! Thanks for Sharing !
👏👊👍🏆🙏
0:06 MORR-Dun
Looks nice I thought it would be easier to just make it square but it really fits nice.
What software are you using for the design work?
Awesome tank and great job with the recovering and God bless from GA
Getting better.
if you are going to leave your battery there, put it in a box with a vent out of the cabin. and make sure its strapped good.
Hey Rudy nice to see you back nice to see you a few more times a week THX
I hope that battery is tied down well.
Awesome recovery Rudy your dad at that😂
Love the reservoir and your sight window on the tank. Pretty darn slick
The Rudicon is starting to prove itself!
Dang man you left us hanging.  Was that one of your chrome moly that broke or something else?    If you could go out the bottom, why winch the UTV up the hill??  Love the shop and how far you have come.  Janelle and Otis are great additions.
You need to do a rename to NVRDN
So what all do you build at your shop.
Like the logo too
ahhhh, yes,,it does feel good to get Dad out once in awhile doesn't it.
Great video, very capable rig you got there. AC should definitely be top of the to do list. Hope you all have a fantastic 4th of July.
👍
Time to get that tape off and put your logo on the Rudicon!  Stub shaft busted on the Banana? Seems to eat them like candy!
Go get em Rudy and his little man als your special lady !! 🇺🇸Happy 4th🇺🇸👍🏻🦅😎
That reservoir turned out really nice. Good work on the recovery as well.👍
So, nice shop you have there. Looks like fun!
We have a plasma table at work that plays music as the cut head moves around, when it's not cutting. G&R, AC/DC etc. It is a hell of a lot of coding!
Love your vid . Your lady friend needs to give us the weather.
Love the design of the overflow reservoir Rudy!  Man you sure have talent and skill when it comes to modifications!  Keep them videos coming!  Have you started to sell any merch yet?  The hat and shirt look great.
Rudy seems to be walking on eggshells,  what's up with that? stress or camera girl issues.
Y’all need a hands free kit, man.
So safe, it is OSHA approved, ha ha
so did he get a shirt?
It was just Otis panting , I thought something was broken.
Wow that was pretty steep...  nice CAD work too 👍🏼   🤘🏼🇺🇲
That was a great video bro !!!! Great job on Savin your Dad
GOOD JOB! LOOKING GOOD!...
will the Rudicon be renamed the Radicon?
Can hardly wait to see Matt's video of this rescue and why he made the call 🤣
Ale 8 1, Yeah buddy! Plant is next city from me. :)
That reservoir is gnarly!
next video has Rudy sportin pig tails ..... cause it's fashionable
Another great instalment and installation. Loving your content. Thanks for sharing.
I love your videos. Down home showing everyone can actually do there own work. Just like Eric O says on south main  auto. " just remember viewer's,  if I can do it, so can you"
I think your going to need some temperature rated tubing for engine coolant.
The reservoir turned out good, nice little side project. With all of the steel and equipment you have in your shop, you might have to build your own heavy wrecker. Rudcon did good, glad you had the extra motor for it. The channel going pretty good!
Nice job on the tank fab and recovery.  I will comment the sight tube may give a false level reading when the fluid temp in the resrvoir heats up if it is not vented. The airspace above the fluid will heat up and pressurize. With the larger surface area of the fluid in the tank vs the sight tube, the fluid will be pushed up higher in the tube, just like capillary action. Just vent the can and it will be ok.
Ok music got better. Thank you
Nice one Rudy, good luck with your new channel.
Please change depressing background music to something more upbeat. Love the content tho!
Rudy, you've got some cool machines in your shop and designing and building that reservoir was very interesting 👍.  Great job Recovering the Banana 🍌 👍. That hill was something!!!  Happy 4th of July to all of you.
Careful that clear tubing may not be rated for the pressure.
Could of bought ome and spent less money on it's time is money
IMHO  .....  It looked kind of " Staged " to me. I hope not.
What type of winch do you use ?
Happy 4th Rudy
Hey Rudy and Crew great job 👍❤️✌️🇺🇸Happy 4th of July
good job
Great video, I appreciate how you explain what’s going on. Continued success my friend.
Nice save Rudy 👍
Rudy, Is that an Ale8 1 drink on your plasma table? If so had did you get it??
It's awesome to see the Rudicon back out on recoveries! Glad your reservior worked as designed!
@9:05 Hot! Like father, like son.
Next time  on rad ,Rudy puts an ac in the rudicon.
I believe catch tank should be vented Rudy. Try and see.
Pausing at 0:38 - As one working in infosec, that backdrop on the CNC, the Tux penguin with "Command and CNC" was epic!
Dude that’s dope! Son to the rescue 🛟!! Sometimes the good old man needs a hand or two here an there. & remember even a good superhero needs help.
Thx 4th the vid .
Now let's put A/C in it! =)
Nice work.   Do you throw a cloth cover - an old sheet - or something similar over your PC and related electronics next to the plasma cutter when not in use?
All that work, welding, fittings, etc, for a recovery bottle that can be had for around $ 20.
Rudy to the rescue.
You know the sand is deep when it comes over the top of your boots.
Great job, Rudy!
That's a tough material to weld with 035
Looking really good fabrication and laying out Rudy, great job brother!
Little tidbit of advice. Shades to protect your eyes need to be UV-a and UV-b blockers. Also side protection is a must as light reflecting off the backside of the linse can damage your eyes. Even though we can't see it, the UV coming off the plasma is very bright and will damage your eyes, especially if its reflecting off the back side of the linse.
Rudy!! You are quite the welder, metalworker and mechanic.
Dude good luck to you and your future
Rudy great job you have become a very good welder and fabricator. Another name for that break is a "finger " break. Your overflow tank was a piece of art, but we know in real life for the average jeepers they would go to the yard find a tank out of another vehicle but it's nice to see you use and learn how to use your tools better keep up the great job oh and did you have a shirt to give to your dad lol...
Some fab work and a recovery, what more could we ask for.  Thanks!
How did you get the use of such an awesome facility for fab and repair?
good job Rudy you need a Tig welder . Roy
You're going to need a vent hole in that plug
RAD is my initials! That's pretty damn RAD
Someone suggested you keep updating the fractions on the side of the Rudicon...they will kill your kid brother! 😂 Nice save.
Good job, Rudy.
21st century steam punk design, truly adorable! And here’s why: form still follows function, steam punk or not!!!!!! Oh, and this: that orange and those skies? Phenomenally beautiful! Thanks for warming my heart!
… I thought the dog hastling was the fan belt ticking
Sounds like it's time to put tooth on axles in the 🍌
Love the tank build and love that Matt HAD to be rescued...lol..great job Rudy...
Great video. 5⭐Rudy, God Bless and have a safe 4th of July. 🇺🇸
Rudi is quite the fabricator!   Now sell these custum build cookie tins  on your website!
You might want to consider putting some small hose clamps on your sight glass hose, last thing you need is that coming off mid wheeling/recovery
nice one :D but couldn't you make two videos out of that? like one for working on your jeep and one for "rescue jobs"?
Oh man, you're going to get all the internet rumors started up again 😂
19:00 I'm glad you showed your dog, for a minute I thought that was your girlfriend panting.
Rudy got them out
I am seeing progress in your production...keep working!
I lked this video starting to become a little more dynamic. You are progressing man! 💪🤙
I want a T-Shirt like you have on, Where?
Awesome!
when are you gonna tell us how you acquired your new shop and equipment? it looks impressive,  the people want to know.....or did I miss something?
Is RUDY a shy person or what, i mean its. OK but he seems a little nervous .But keep doing those videos , we miss seeing you with MAT M.O.R.R.👍😊
Win win.
Good job 👍.  Hey that’s a “RAD” logo you DESIGNED…🧐
Poor Otis. He was like “when’s this rig getting some AC?  I ain’t built for this heat!”
Shouldn't it be the 1/2 done RADicone now?
That took me off guard seeing an Ale8 on your table hope u enjoy the KY SWAMP WATER awesome videos
It looks like you need a set of annular cutters. Bi-metal hole saw bits are only technically capable of being used on metal but not designed for it at all. Annular cutters are truly designed for drilling large holes in steel.
You would think the ratchet strapped gas tank and what ever was going on with filling it would be a much higher priority
As you get the Rudicon "more done", you could change the fraction on the side.......19/32 Dun......23/32 Dun.  Blow everyone's mind.  They'd be like, "What?  How do you know it's 27/32 Dun?"  LOL  (I like fractions)  Loved the part when the hole saw fell out of the drill press and your reaction.  Love your videos!!
What do you manufacture in that shop beside working on your 4x4 ?
The overflow tank turned out slick.  Pretty steep hill he found there.  What broke at 18:43?
Nice job
Great job on the overflow tank
Jeez was that steep
Would a coffee can have worked?
Dumb question: isn't that reservoir going to rust inside?
Rudy, You need to do a "Background" video of how you and your Dad got into the Jeep XJs. What year is your XJ and is it the first one you owned? They are by far one of the best offroad vehicles, the size of the XJ gives it an advantage over other offroad rigs as you can get in and out of some very tight trails that full size vehicles just can't do. Keep up the great content!
My comment for the algorithm
Yes, the cap is vented on the reservoir.
Bring some gas for Matt just incase.....   lol
RUDY, you need to fix the battery setup etc instead of making cute stuff,
Good job helping your dad  your recovery jug looks good
😊 it's Allway's COOOL to help ur Pop's get unStuck 👍 Since im sure the ole man has saved U from a few Problem's u got urself into 👍👍 P.S maybe 5/8 done now 🤔
THEY GET BETTER AND BETTER !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love ur channel but do miss u at Matt’s u tube also do u rent that garage or do u live there keep up the great work
Hahahaha. Still rescuing your dad as always.
dumb question, but we've all heard Rudy call Matt his dad. Never heard him call Jamie, mom. Maybe I just haven't watched enough MORR videos to have caught it but I was just wondering if Jamie is Rudy's biological mom.  Not that it matters one damn bit, just something that bounced through my brain. I'm here for the fabricobbling and shenanigans. This channel is awesome!
You may need to schedule a training session with Paul and learn about his advanced Cardboard Assisted Design.
Kinda disappointed you made that reservoir in the shape of a simple hexagon, instead of a Rhombicosidodecahedron. But, hey - it works, sooo...
Who's shop is that with the CNC machine?
Tape and pipe dope Rudy, it's the plumbers creed!
Hopefully you added a vent to that reservoir can. Looks good
Great video! Love the RAD design!
One of these times that you rescue Matt, you need to have a bin of your shirts and give him one after you "get em out"
Matt's family ROCK
Remember all the times we've all called our dad's to get out of a pickle... it's nice to have the favor returned. I know he appreciates it a LOT!!! Nice job on the RAD too!!!
PVC hose will fail at about 140F.
Great job Rudy  , your jeep is "KILLER " enjoy the 4th of July weekend with family and friends.
JUST LIKE YOUR DAD :)
Nice to see you guys are still on good terms
Coffee can would've been cool. Glad you're back doing videos again it's been awhile. Happy 4th to you and the family.
Nicely done! Thanks!
Rudicon to the rescue. 😁😁😁 Have a fun and safe 4th of July weekend Rudy and family.
You should of gave your dad a shirt..
Happy 4th of July, FYI the back ground music you were playing at end is the intro music to PACKAST you tube channel
I like the idea that Rory has to carry a spare winch line.  It's lighter than carrying three extra ropes and easier to deploy and stow.  It's not cheap, but quite useful and versatile.
Love your channel, Rudy! Well done on the reservoir and the recovery!
That even looked steep on camera
Rad
No one likes a leaky can!
33%  done = 1/2 DUN 55% done = 1/2 DUN 78% done = 1/2 DUN 98.6% done - 1/2 DUN DUN, DUN-DUN, DUN... DUN!
Rudy: Painstakingly fabricates a reservoir. Me: Grabs an empty milk jug and a bungee cord. Me also: I don't have all those cool tools.
Use a brass cap, but if its stainless, it's ok, G.I. will disappoint you
You should put  your logo on shirts... and on the back it should say "I get Dad out!"
I'm happy for you and your friend it's cool to watch you grow up and do your own thing and tell your dad if he keeps saying awesome I'm going to puke lol
I still love that rack and cage you built for the Rudicon.
Good work, just need a vent on that tank
😎👍
I am only halfway through but had to stop to say I am enjoying this episode a lot.  I like your curved mounting bracket and hose clamps. Simple and elegant, and allows for easy removal. Good engineering, Rudy.
Good job on the coolant tank!  You need to make another RAD sign to put on the back of the Rudicon!
If you want to get the Rubicon more done you’re gonna have to go to the More family lol
Amazing work all around Rudy!!! Great seeing what you are up to!! 😋
Guess I was wondering how the fluid got from the radiator to the tank!  There was no line from the radiator.
Jeep looks great Rudy! Lose the tape.
Shouldn't you add some padding between the tank mount and the strut tower?
👍🥸
That Was CRAZY
Happy 4th Rudy & Janelle, nice job on the overflow can, that's a serious slope getting that razor & your Dad out, if you get any RAD swag let us know, great video ❤😉👍
Good job on the recovery tank Rudy. You got dad out also, you are just an OK son to have around.
Please make sure that your reservoir has a vent in it so it doesn't create a closed system
Vents have been mentioned but I don't see that it's connected to the radiator.
Hello Rudys, can you send me the size of the banana jeep tires because I want to buy the same tires as your car. Greetings from Finland❤
The Rudicon has come a long way since I first saw it. I welded in a sheet metal shop, and having the shears and brakes save a lot of time. Great job  on the overflow tank !!
Is this you shop business
I love this truck. And here is where the battery used to be, only now I have this little nuclear reactor I built, so—yeah. It's like the Theseus' ship of trucks, if Theseus hadn't bothered putting parts back where they started, only improving all of the time. "Theseus, buddy, what happened to your ship?" I improved it. "Improved it?" Yup. "Looks a bit funny." Come over here, I wanna show you something. "Oh yeah?" It's called a cannon port.
Yay great job!!!
Happy July 4th to you and the family. Your Jeep is slowing coming along. Miss seeing you do rescues with your Dad.
Like it hope that is stainless
11:25  I bet you will find out soon that your new overflow bottle needs to be vented, not sealed.
Matt made a call and you didn't have a shirt for him lol.
Nice work too all!   Got em out 😁👍👍💪💪
So what is it about not using funnels to pour liquids into holes? Funnels are cheaper than dirt, never hurts to keep a few around! ;)
The timing of the call was perfect.  "Reservoir is done, now we have an excuse to go roading."  *ring, ring*  Love the new logo, Rudy!
Tune in next time when we see Rudy put air conditioning in the Rudicon. Happy 4th of July everyone ! 🇺🇸💥🇺🇸💥🇺🇸💥🇺🇸
So when you rescue Pops does he say: And the student becomes the Master ?
Nice looking radiator reservoir and it even works too ! 👍
Nice job you three, it sounded like Otis was feeling the heat also.
Gassing up before the rescue?  That’s breaking with family tradition! 😉
No vent
so glad to see the rudicon back in action lol doing what it does best going on rescues!
Recovery nice
Vent the cap
Golly that thing is steep, even on camera.
That's RAD!!
I'm really trying to get into your videos, because I'm subscribed to Matt's channel. At this point it's a struggle.
What’s size are your Patagonia’s
Does the plasma table run Linux as its operating system?
no breather?
OMG you know what be cool … get an old firehouse … so when you get a call you can slide down the pole … just like in ghost busters 🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Does Matt get a Rudy's Adventure and Design shirt?  He made a call!
Happy 4th💣💥🗽
Well done young Man
You Need golden nugget in your workshop
Does look cooler than just one of those regular 1 gal vegetable can 👍🏻👍🏻
❤️👍👍👍👍👍😎
Good work, all of it! You would make any father quite proud.
Ask Robby To Paint The RUDICON Bright Orange :-)))))))))))))
Oh yeah....Happy 4th  to all !
Almost could’ve just used those 1 gal cans that cafeterias get their vegetables and stuffs in 🤷🏻‍♂️
👍👍👍👍👍
Great video Rudy....you better keep your honey hydrated
Nice Work!  Solid Fab and Recovery!
now that's a Hill
Always good to see you and your dad working together. That was quite the hill.
Most project's are mostly "Half Done" ! ! !
👍 Ruuudy!!
Nice to see Rudy again do recoveries with Matt good job Rudy
Vented lead acid batteries vent little or no gas during discharge. However, when they are being charged, they can produce explosive mixtures of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gases, which often contain a mist of sulphuric acid. Hydrogen gas is colorless, odorless, lighter than air and highly flammable.
loved it!!
When it's 100ft uphill but you end up walking 1/4 mile because you sink back to where you stepped away from.
Need to change to 5/8 done😁👍👍
Too belt-driven, high profit margin, flimsy toys out on the real trails. A dirt bike would be more fun and you may or may not get stuck. Ok, maybe you will need to be a Trials athlete in some places, but bikes ain't no toys.
μεταφραση?
Twelfth 👊🏻💪🏻
Good timing on that completely coincidental call just after u finished 11:24 😅
Love your videos Rudy
✌️🇲🇽✌️🇲🇽✌️
Rudy if you turn your c clamp over it won't spin and give you more room.
Happy 4th of July Rudy to you and your family🇺🇲
Matt is old school and eye balls. You have technology and a huge plasma cutter, etc. I love seeing the 2 generations working with their hands creating amazing off-roaders - using the machines of their generation! Wish you continued success! Would love to meet you one day! ❤️🐞
Please keep caption on thank you
👍🏻
Im first
First today
Good day everyone
