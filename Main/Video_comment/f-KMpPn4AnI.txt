I thought click was gone
OG RELEAED A YEAR AGO???????????
Has muselk realised slap battles is a game in Roblox
10:14 nah their coping roblox
6:51
10:25
3:07  that’s criminal.Literally 😂
why couldnt chappdoodle mantle🤦‍♂️
Bro why didnt chappadoodle just mantle onto the stairs
Excuse me how the hell did he make a 13 minute SHORT
Here are the summaries for this video: * The video is about re-creating iconic Fortnite moments from the past. * The video starts with the first ever Fortnite video of the player, where he sky-based and shot an insane snipe. * The player then re-creates a two-for-one meme where he used to break fall damage with a porta. * The player then re-creates a moment where he used the Love Ranger skin to disguise himself and get kills. * The player and his friend tried to build all the way to spawn island, and they re-create that moment as well. * The player trolls his friend by impulses him off a cliff. * The player and Chapad Doodle re-create a classic moment where the player saved Chapad Doodle from being stuck off the side of a cliff.
CHAPPADOODLE???
5:00-10:02 Legendary and hilarious moment
Rip chappadoodle
They put the cup because of the kill with the love ranger skin there if I’m not incorrect
Chappadoodle video is how I found Muselk and I can’t be the only one!
Yo click is still a thing?
8:50 that's what she said
CHAPPADOODLE YEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
You made my day😂❤
My first game of og season I went looking for the grave lol. That game I ended up chappedoodling my friend and hitting him into water.
How has bro not hit 10 million it’s been four years💀
You sunn of a ( gun shots)
I remember watching this channel 6 years ago in my dorm room. Trying to get better at Fortnite. So fun to see it all come back😂 makes me feel old now
10:48 Askeladd vs Thorfinn in a nutshell
3:08  - 3:13    the disrespect to one the ogs.
bro chapadoodle is so chill and funny i love him
Add the cliff in the map (with his gravestone)
Chappadoodle just casually walks around his own grave
Lightning in a bottle moment insisted on being a lightning in a bottle moment and god it had me laughing my ass off. Thanks muselk.
Musie, this was fun! Hope you are well and ready for the next chapter in your career! From a long time, but not quite OG, fan. Be well.
The ultimate cameo/comeback character: Chaperdoodle
Chapter 3 kids be like: just mantle
lachy and muselk reunion
Love it when fortnite map makers copy roblox games
Sad to see the Old moments go by so fast, but someone it trying to bring the OG times back…
New players: Why didn't Chappdoodle just mantle?  OGs: smh...
1:00 the graphics difference is CRAZY
Elliot mentioned click
Muselk from 2021 9 million subs
Chappadoodle is back yessssss
10:02 thats from roblox
That was it ? Why's the video so short?
W Vids as always muselk keep it up!
who long you don't do that in this map? i'm remember whem i see your frist video and how thiswork so hard on that time kkkkk
BRO YOU NEED A ICON SKIN
Chappadoodle!!!!!!
Yup, heard "OG Fortnite" was making a comeback, first question was "did they bring back the Chappadoodle memorial?" How time flies...
Facecam?
Bro barely even plays fn
I miss save the world 😢
I forgot all about the statue skin Tom foolery 😂😂😂😂😂
Let me tell you how I searched you yesterday didn’t see a new video and was so sad and I saw the clip just now on shorts and had to come watch the full video
"I'm trash, I'm trash, I need to retire" 🤣😭😂😂😂😭
Can I just say no facecam Muselk is better
just watching muselk with no cam is so og
8:07 chappdoodle dies
Went and payed my respects to chappodoole with I bow for one of the best and most funny clips in Fortnite history
Do a other video with chapadoddle
We need more muselk
Jesus i haven’t seen this man in years
I don't know if the Traps are back in I haven't gotten one but the jump pads are. We need an OG Muselk Trap Tower!
Where  is  your  content  men!!!! Keep  this stuff going I'm  in your channel daily
lololol!!!
Muselk is back !!!!!! Love you dawg keep posting!
Your a fucking legend bro my fav YouTuber like 4 or 5 years ago
Can chapadoodle add me so we can play with u 2 I wanna also learn about the history of u 2 and memes lol
You gotta recreate covering dust divot bro
jesus what a trip down memory lane with this vid, very fun!!!!! <3
Can you bring back the "random skin rarity = gun rarity" plsss
Bro I've been watching muselk since I was 11. I'm a grown fucking adult now this is crazy
I haven’t watched Muselk in awhile, so can someone please tell me why he isn’t using a face cam anymore??
🤣I cantt find the hole … sotry of my life🤣😭🤣omfgg( they secretly added code that chappadoddle can’t be hit off map with atk) 😭
Give this man his own skin
Would have made more sense recreating the Chappadoodle moment but instead saving him the way you originally planned
I was really hoping for the 2017 version. Some of the best times of my life playing fortnite with my friends my junior year of high school. Now we’re all adults with jobs, kids and have all gone our separate ways in life. It’s sad to think about. Time flies kids. Enjoy it while you can because you can’t go back!
Mr muselk Still can’t fight just like back in season 5 seriously how did you miss your shotgun edit you missed 5 bullets
skin woon 33 62 705 wowe out off
nice
Get this man to 90million, I swear he is one of the reasons I started playing Fortnite
5:42
What a video man. I genuinely felt so emotional as I watched this. Please come back, we need you
Muselk! Retail row talking fish!!!
Let s gooo Muselk s back
That cup on the rock is cause of you muselk
2018  Muselk: oh no, this guy is stuck, I’m gonna (try to) help him  2023  Muselk: Oh no, chappadoodle is stuck, I’m gonna try to hit him with my car
Man i remember the first video of yours i ever watched was the one were you were testing the build limit in save the world
Yooo I killed u there 😂 3:00  Saw ur pants lol
I saw that I Paid My Respects
i beg you,cray and bazza make a vid for the og season
You Are Back!
Y Aren't U Back in OW2? U Need MORE views that = cash. Don't even know this game but kinda on PURPOSE, just sayin...
Omg the nostalgia and the wholesome feels of Muselk reuniting with Chappadoodle and actually hearing him talk was an amazing feeling
Missed you 🎉
You can still break fall damage with porta forts ( i did an insane clutch with my friends when skybasing and i threw it last second and the tire spawned right before i touched the ground)
The goat is back🐐🔥🙌🏽
that was so long ago it just like wow
too much profanity
This was hilarious😂
I’m so glad to see another fortnite video! Hopefully more to come.
More muselk for og fort !
pls come back to make more fortnite content
Woaaahhhhh! My guy Muselk is finally back! Been patiently waiting for this, bruv. Glad to see it.
there's a new hilarious clip of a troly taking out a whole squad
Lets goo muselk!!
rip chapodoodle
cover dusty with builds again
Lets ho the king returned
Great to see it now all we need is bazaaaaa
Y not build downwards out of wall and then downwards against the wall with fall limit for wagon towards the wall...then it will not bounce into sea?
Nice
y’all bullied him out of using a face cam :/
Didn’t think FN could bring a tear to my eye but goddamn you’ve bloody done it
me and my friends said as a joke "lets skybase this game" and we actually commited and won😂
Muselk where the HECK have u been
Wow real Chappadoodle so swag and cool
Thank God you're back. I missed these
I hope you make more vids we missed you and i miss your funny vids soo i hope you Upload more
Wow
honestly just retire at this point
CHAPPADOODLE!
theory: while we go through og fortnite, things will change and be slightly different than they used to, this will lead to us going through the entierty of fortnite again, but differently,
missed you muselk welcome back
Welcome back
Glad to see you back
Should have called it slappadoodle
Good to see you back man. You and click should reunite, I think a lot of your viewers would love that a LOT.
Maybe they put that cup there for u
When we needed him the most, he returned 😊
So glad your back
I immediately searched your name when I realized skybasing was still a thing
It's nice to see you back on fortnite muselk. It's been a longggg 2 months without watching your vids 😮
U should start making daily fort vids
Chappadoodle has newfound plot armor
bro stole a roblox game and put it on fortnite
Why Diddnt he just mantel?
went straight to ur channel when i heard about the old map drop, you are my favorite nostalgic fortnite youtuber for sure
The impulses suck and the grapplers are mid, sheilds are so hard to find, and it's near impossible to find good guns off spawn because of the lack of chests. The map is so simple with pretty much no cover anywhere. I understand that it's just for nostalgia but come on. If I try playing build mode I just get absolutely destroyed because I'm mid at building. The guns do basically no damage and as someone with really good aim, having no assault rifles with a scope that does decent damage is really frustrating. I can't wait for chapter 5.
cant believe muselk ripped off a roblox game😂
dont ever leave me for 2 months again!
They  put a rift there now
I saw the thumbnail and had to see it, seeing Chappadoodle reunited with Muselk is too wholesome 😭😭
Chapperdoodle! I remember the times, Elliot!
Come back man you my last YouTuber I grew up that still was uploading a lot I miss you man
From when is click back??
CHAPPADOODLE 😁😁😁😁😁
Ah man I miss these days.
be carefull of tencell the owner of roblox slap battles lol
Petition to bring back facecam
Why do u feel like that’s not really chapadoddle
"Oh no I'm being knocked by an ATK" 🤣
The fact that he actually got chappadoodle in a game is amazing
Now we wait for the Junk rift so he can once again find the chosen one
This man has so many people… all of them reminiscing, maybe about old Fortnite, maybe about something else, either way. Good Job, Muselk.
Chappadoodle is back
I Like ur videos and is it possible to see ur face like with facecam
I’m sad we didn’t get the og muselk intro too 😭
He’s back!!!!!!❤
You should play more games with chappadoodle
im gonna cry 😭 i love that iconic moments
I'm sorry, but your video's are boring without facecam.. why did you stop with that?...
Bro literally failed recreating every meme. Can't help but get disappointed by the fact that this is the upload after so many days, months!!
He's back
I thought click was done for?
Wow I remember wondering what happened to chappadoodle when watching the video the day it came out glad to see he’s still doing fine
This is honestly one of the best parts of the season. That original video plus Epic’s response (I don’t think there’d ever been a player acknowledgement or anything like it) are so iconic.  As this seems to be a celebration of all the old memories, what better time for a five year reunion and a hug? It’s cool to finally hear it from Chappadoodle’s perspective too.  Btw, trying to hit him and him apparently having ‘golf cart protection’ now was hilarious.
Og Muselk is back
So glad your back man!!
You said you'll make a minecraft episode if you get 75k or something likes, this was in your last episode of minecraft, where's the episode huh??
It’s a 1 in a million chance or something
finally he returns to fort!!!!
Good video I enjoyed it
You should do your OG challenges again 😂
The difficulty of recreating the chappadoodle rescue was hilarious 😂 😂
WHY IS THIS MAN NOT AT 10 MIL YET????
One of the best moments in Fortnite history.
How original...(slap battle)
even though i don't play much fortnite you're my favorite fortnite youtuber :)
The memories
We want chapter 5
Damn the death montage had me DYING bro lmfao OOOOMG
he's back yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
Where’s the face cam
He's back😢😢😢 full blast of serotonin
The king is back!!
#1 fortnite youtuber back in the day 💪🏼
I’ve taken a long break from Fortnite & the content that went with but bloody hell have I missed your laugh.
I tried to skybase but got knocked down 15 times out of 14🙃😬
I know u were missing it and glad ur playing
“Trying to find the hole bro… Story of my life” had my dying 😂😂
Knew you would come back
Bring back face cam
it’s like they put an anti atk forcefield around chappadoodle so he never has to experience the trauma of being hit by an atk ever again
The very first video I came to look for was yours - the og meme master himself. I’ve really been missing your videos on your break. I hope you continue to upload during this season. It wouldn’t be og Fortnite without you, Muselk!
I’m so happy that you are back muselk, I have been her in this channel since day 1, and old OG Fortnite
YAY
You haven't made a video in months. You haven't done anything fun for years. And of course you come out with this weird dribble when OG fortnite returns.
Did he say click or am i tripping cause i thought that wad gone
Nice video
As soon as I heard they were bringing the OG map back, I instantly thought of Muselk and how I would watch his videos back in highschool when a new fortnite update would drop
How are there more likes than views or am i triplin
Bro i havevnt watched muselk since i stopped playing 4 yrs ago😭😭😭i jus recently remembered the name muselk and i rannnn to yt😭😭😭😭❤️
ily chappadoodle
Oh god, i remember watching your video about chappa when it released just because you appeared in my recommended and oh god... Im just gonna cry out of nostalgia. Also bro was just reviewing every possible scenario and timeline of the chappadoodle incident
Is Elliot ok? Has he become a bit self conscious because where has the face cam gone?
CHAPADOODLE!!
Thanks for making my childhood muselk, preciate you brotha
the amount of times muselk fails to save chappadoodle just goes to show how legendary of a moment that was
He’s back on fortnite
Should of called the map "Slappadoodle"
my favourite youtubers back🎉
We want more chappadoddle!!!
4:52 🤣
Aww this brings back so many memories! Whenever i drop Paradise Palms I always gotta stop by the Chappadoodle grave 😆
Love to see you back! I have already used Chappdoodle's rift like 7 times and taught my sister a history lesson lol
I saw the post on the fortnite subreddit so apparently, I'm here now lol.
😭 forgot about chappadoodle that's how I found your channel
I haven't played fortnite in 4 years and I'm reinstalling it
R.I.P chapadoodle
I started playing fortnite because of the chapadoodle video.
So happy ur back! We’ve all missed ur content
And you are back too this video is a banger one I remember watching everyday 2018 19 17 12 am before sleeping and after playing fortnite all day 💔❤️‍🩹❣️❤️❤️‍🔥
How tf is it 5 years
what a masterpiece edit: having it with chappdoddle is even more of a masterpiece
The Love Ranger video was my first Muselk video, and literally inspired me to download the game…. It’s been a good run since then 😂
Keep posting bro 😢
Hes back!
Miss u bro
We need you back, sir. Remember what your grandmother taught you, Elliot… NEVER LET YOUR MEMES BECOME DREAMS.
Muselks channel is dead

Missing the muselk BR meme videos

Wish I could give this video 100 likes. Such a blast of nostalgia! I went yesterday to see if they'd put the gravestone back and was so happy to see  it. Such a serendipitous moment could never be recreated, but it sure was fun to see you guys try. ❤
Please make more regular content Muselk
Muselk, chapter 1, memes. Yes.
Blud getting copyrighted by Roblox fr

It is good to see you back @muslek. i have miss your video's of doing funny things. i starting watching you when i first started playing back in season 3 and have watched all of your videos. I would love it if you could do an old fashioned rage deathrun with fresh again i loved the ones from season 8 with the quad crahsers. keep it up.
OMG, TRYING to recreate the death of Chapadoodle was hilarious
I haven’t watched or played Fortnite in ages, as soon as I heard the OG map was coming back I immediately came back to your channel/my favorite fortnite youtuber. Thank you Muselk for the memories my friend.
It felt so good watching this family reunion.

Chappadoodle coming back is honestly insane
MUSELK IS BACKKKKKKK
YES! FINALLY!
Why has meuselk been gone
9:35 name of music
2017 Fortnite with Muselk the GOAT still hits different.. I have't Muselk in a hot minute because he has not uploaded fortnite in a while but especially his OG content of how it was back in chapter 1 and it really is similar to that vibe we once had!
I hate how they didn’t change the defaults like bro
OG IMPULSE TEAMMATE MEME
Keep uploading bro let’s get you to 10 mil 🤝🏾
I hate to admit, but I accidentally destroyed chappadoodle’s grave when I fell off the mountain with a golf cart
7:03 But... Manslaughter is... By definition. Accidental homicide.
Oh yeah daddy 😫
Bro said "thats criminal" while he was wearing a criminal skin🤓🤓🤓
Pls make more videos
10:10 "me and the amazing people at Click" CLICK IS RETURNING?! 👀
was waiting for your video. Watched you all those years ago, and now im missing the return to OG cause of work, time flies huh.
Muslik  Hi🥹
After 5 years. We got the answer. The other guy wasn't saving chappadoodle. What a relief.
Muselk finally returns to this channel :)
Thank you
He’s baaack
Yooo😭🙏
MUSELK THE GOAT
the heavy feels like ass. i would take a green pump over it
Love your video
Finally….
Yay, Muselk's back 😁
Watch out chapperdoodle!!!
I managed to get my first win this season doing a skybase after tryharding all day trying to the umbrella. Feels great to have memes winning on the og map.
I KNEW HED COME BACK
I missed ya man
I love the part when Muselk and Chappadoodle kissed at the end of the video
We just need a Muselk and Lachy putting down a jump pad and running off the skybase for the old school reenactments to be complete.
Finally
I love this .. very wholesome moment recreation of another one
I love this .. very wholesome moment recreation of another one
Pls cover up dusty again with that was legendary
Finally muselk is back
I immediately went to go look for Chappdoodle’s gravestone on the map and I was so glad to know that they kept it in. It literally was the first time that Epic memorialized a player in the game, so it’s nice that they kept it around after all these years.
bro really made a fortnite map based off of a roblox game
CHAPPADOODLE!!!
Como estas bebe
He's still alive!? 😅😮
Upload more
Fire video
those Muselk 2017 christmas videos coming home from school just hit different
