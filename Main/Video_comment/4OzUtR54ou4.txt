That face tells it all
Meanwhile pep ask for return policy.
135m +160m +145m = 440m on three players  Their wages are also close to 100m
What a messi affair
Messi to Leeds?
Messi didn't "quit". Jesus.
ho ho ho when it becomes true by seeing messi in another side running on the oval >>>>>>>..i will believe it !!!!!
Messi didn't quit Barcelona...get your facts right
No Messi nooooooō
dude i'm used to this guy getting frustrated and making me laugh but now he's all serious and it's making me sad. he's basically doing an impression of every non barca fan. they're sad or in disbelief that he's leaving, they acknowledge messi has been at barca forever and then they wonder where he will go next.   which ever club leo will go to will automatically get like 3 billion followers and fans 🤣
Messi quits??? Bro what????
You guys don't need to worry about Messi where is gone
Messi ‘quits’? Are you tapped?
The squeamish police thessaly consist because fowl natively fade times a available state. wakeful, lovely morning
Messi has nothing to prove, it's irrelevant if he plays in Epl or Ligue 1 the point is he's going to destroy any league he plays in.
I'm no more fan of barca 💔
Messi to Stoke, c'mon son... come live the dream 💪
Just to witness him in the premier league would be great and a better challenge for him but we all know he's going to take the easy route to PSG.
I believe PSG with the Neymar and Di Maria connection plus all the new signings with the old like Mbappe is just the obvious choice. Manchester City is 2nd with the Pep connection and with a pristine squad as well. If Messi wants more of a challenge then going to City is the choice. Chelsea have no chance unless they offer a hell of a lot more than the other two clubs mentioned above but I believe Messi won’t just care about the money for he wants to enjoy his football with friends and have that golden connection with those mentioned above.
Only because hed have to take a pay cut
He will be linked with West ham everyone is lol
At times you TALK thrash.. What do you mean by MANCHESTER UNITED CANT AFFORD MESSI.....
messi on his way to Liverpool
Messi if he ends up at Arsenal be like:   ''My garden shed is bigger than this....."
Trending!!
Very sad that Messi has to leave. Barca have done this to themselves.
Shocking that Barca have cheated so badly, they are destroyed.
Harry is back at Spurs.... I did say it hahahahaha
Mannn  i can't picture messi in another jersey...
Even Gretzky got traded - they said that couldn't happen, and it happened a few times. So Messi is no different. This is great for the world of football, especially if he goes to England
<<<<< Crazy Scary
Mark: Chelsea, Man city and Paris are owned by billionaires  The Glazers: *Sad leech noises*
You think Ole will try to cancel Jadon and Varane’S contract to sign Messi ?
She join man city or psg Never united 😂😂😂
Fans chealsea be like "papa abramovic please do your magic"😂
I think messi really just want to leave barcelona, cause is 21 years that ia so long carrer
Hey Mark you should to a video about Chelsea offering 120 million for Lukaku .
Respect to u when u say that messi is the best player in the world.
I'm really happy I chose not to put Messi on my Barca shirt. that said, the player name I did choose ended up leaving before he did, who was Suárez.
Heartbreaking💔 for football⚽
Its their own fault for buying flops like coutinho griezmann and dembele
would he go to the MLS - maybe LA Galaxy - a longhsot i know.
Messi should just stay and take what they can afford. He's already got huge wealth. It's just dirty taking Oil FC money at this stage.
Rip Messi 😂 byby bacrlona hahaha
He could go to boca or he could play in serie a an become a Maradona/batistuta
Messi domt care about fotbal he care about moer moyen be rich. That why go Psg
Jac grhils is tresh player he dont won eour ? Engalan lol play in vila ,  bet Cyti sttt This bench domt let he play ,
Messi to Psg faire  team Psg tickte France liga make more moyen. Shirts be bigg bussin mabpe Neymar Messi  wIn champonslague
omg omg  What NFL team did he play for ?  lmao     lolol  whe cares !
Messi is not suitable for premier league. He was too many years in LaLiga to adopt to Premier League game style. Maybe PSG or 🙄🙄🙄🙄... maybe retirement
Aguero and Depay join barcelona to play with messi.. **Messi move from Barcelona** Aguero and Depay : 😃?
Messi arsenal
Imagine if Lionel Messi joins Juventus???
Him an CR7 at Juventus will be fantastic
Go to Juventus with CR7
Imagine if psg get messi and ronaldo with likes of neymar mbape in team that would be fireworks
ANYONE TOUTING MESSI TO MANCHESTER UNITED ARE NOT REAL SUPPORTERS OR FANS OF OUR CLUB AND ARE TOTALLY DISRESPECTING OUR WORLD CLASS HERO RONALDO IN THE PROCESS.  I`M PLEASED MESSI IS LEAVING BARCELONA, JUST TO WATCH ALL YOU FAKE SHYTES COME OUT THE WOODWORK CLAMOURING FOR OUR MANCHESTER UNITED TO SIGN HIM. IF OLE EVEN TRYS IT HE SHOULD BE SACK AND ANY MANCHESTER UNITED FOOTBALL CHANNEL SUPPORTING THIS FARCE SHOULD ALSO BE SHUT DOWN TOO.
Messi coming to white hart lane. You heard it here first.
I want him at Chelsea but he will go to PSG in my opinion
Can he do it at windy cold stoke
Confirmed : Messi to Southampton  after Danny Ings' departure .
United can afford to pay messi, just won’t do it
LaLiga is dead Messi Ronaldo Ramos Neymar Varane are gone and the biggest clubs are nearly bankrupt
He's probably going to psg they have more money its an easier league
Imagine if Messi goes to Juve and plays alongside CR7
Man I feel bad for aguero
could go wrexham
Messi dovrebbe andare alla Juventus per Ronaldo. Yin e Yang dovrebbero stare insieme.
Chelsea wont get him, our wage structure doesnt allow for him, our highest earner is havertz who earns around 300 grand a week if you believe some reports
Please join non league side Southend United and make them league two title contenders again… pleeeeaaaase
These thumbnails are a pisstake surely
This is an end of an era
I really wanna see Messi in the prem
Messi going to the MLS 🤫
I think this is going to be the start of some real dark times for Barcelona. The same as AC Milan
Hes always welcome at utd
Rumour has it a Plymouth Argyle are looking at Messi!
Imagine if Messi came to the prem and flopped 😭
Messi to City.....................fingers crossed
just imagine what Sergio Aguero is going through right now 😵‍💫😔😔
laporta made him an offer he literally couldn’t refuse
Am i the only one thinks that messi is going to either his boyhood club Newell or David Beckham’s Inter Miami? He has expressed his desires before that he wants to play MLS and retire at his boyhood club
if messi goes to psg pogba will stay and sign a new contract then kane can sign for city
Heard it all before
Also I think if city sign grealish Kane and Messi! The prem is going to be dominated by Man City..plus they will just carry the whole team..
Pep is looking for Grealish's receipt 🧾 for a refund .
I dont think he will leave. Think its a play by barca against la ligas constraints on salary
Confirmed : Messi to Southampton  after Danny Ings' departure .
But don't you guys think it's all a trick.
why does the prospect of seeing the best player in the world playing in a new team not excite all football fans?
City prepares to sign Lionel Messi after exit - Fabrizio Romano WOW !!!!
Geez. Just sad
Messi Grealish Combination would be insane for City
Never know he might just retire..
He might stay at barca coz barca are playing a game with laliga bcoz of super league and because of his importance to laliga
Come to Chelsea
Aguero:😭😭😭
aston villa are listening to complete there trio
Man I feel sad for Harry Kane. Even though Messi is my favourite player. Kane has long been a player who has been a world class player but not winning troohies he deserves. Hope that Pep can work it out and get both. Messi, Kane and Sterling. It's gonna be a good trio. Kane is that pure striker whom you need to just feed balls to get goals and Messi is the best player who can help with that.
“He’ll go to Ligue 1 with PSG because it’s easier” - after PSG lost the title to Lille. Buying a team guarantees nothing.
I have no sympathy for Barca poorly run and never forget they are the still one of the main protagonists of the super league. If he leaves you reap what you sow.
If Messi goes to PSG, I can see Mbappe leaving.
He didn’t leave, he couldn’t stay because Barca are Broke
MESSI TO LAKERS CONFIRMED BY FAB💯
Messi's next club will be PSG or Manchester City, one of the two.
The Neymar Messi friendship and the fact that he’s really good friends with paredes and Di Maria could actually lead him to Paris… my god that front line Neymar, Mbappe, Messi, Icardi and Di Maria would be the backups 
honestly I don't think he should come to the prem, he would have to settle for rotation with bernardo silva and others but if he goes to PSG he will make the most money and be the starter
Messi has contributed hugely to Barcelona’s financial problems with his insane amount of greed! No player in World football should ever be on his wages!
Hes coming celtic no question
I hear Burnley are interested.
What hurts more is that he didn’t even want to leave Barca and messi we’re ready for the announcement it came out of nowhere
Messi is not coming to chelsea and we dont need him because we are building a good team right now not focused on one man
man city dosent have a striker and pep's barca didnt play with a striker as a man utd fan i hope he dosent come to city.😒
Barca cannot sell the ruined players and they're selling messi🤡😭😭😭💔
Add a public comment
messi is a money backpack and he is now ot so good
pep is canceling jack transfer
Messi to Burnley
Was Messi waiting for City to buy Grealish 😶
If he goes to city, the debate will surely be over 😭
I would really love Leo to go to Inter. It would actually be a 'challenge' to become league and European champions
best player in the world who hasnt played outside spain..would be interesting to see now
I Never watched soccer before
Change title
Imagine Chelsea doesn't go in with an improved bid for Lukaku and signs Messi as their goal scorer. They can afford to pay so much to his wages by saving on the transfer fee. And Messi is someone you can break your wage structure on.
Barca is the only competition for Woodward😂
would love to see Messi and Ronaldo in the same team... even for a season.
Jack Grealish as to give his number 10 to Messi if he joins city 😂😂
I still hope Lionel Messi joins Manchester United
MeSsI tO NeW yOrK rEd BuLLs
Solskjaer: we can get messi.... Glazers: less money for us? Noooooo.
A MAN WHO DEMAND THE CLUB THAT GIVE HIM EVERYTHING IS A COWARD  HES LIVING VAY THE BACK DOOR
Barcelona fans are crying  in after this newa💔
LOVE TO THE CLUB HE ONLY LOV THE MONEY
Ik he'll probably go to PSG but I want to see him at Chelsea as I believe they have enough passion for him and he'd be playing in the prem.
Forget about Harry Kane, City should go all the way to get Messi now.
It's BLUFF
No team in the world is beating that PSG team with Neymar, Messi, and Mbappe up front and Ramos at the back😶
This is the worst moment for me as a Barca fan
Culer is a endangered  species 😂😂lol
Announce Messi to Manchester United
Messi realize Barca standard has dropped massively base on the type of players coming into the club..
If City gets Messi. You might as well hand City the title for next 2-3 seasons in advance. And If PSG get him. No teams should bother turning up at the Champions League. Either way its daunting. But I guess the only silver lining is that there has to be some delusional Arsenal fans out there. Actually thinking they have a good shot of signing Messi. And that warms my heart.
All their flop 100mill signings and messi's insane contract has bankrupt them it's not feasible for Leo to stay at his age and money. Just remeber the memories of this god
tbh I wouldn't be surprised if China or Dubai get serious about him. For me more likely than any top 5 league teams.
Only one way to finish off his career and in style and that is to go to Napoli! Follow in Maradona’s footsteps
Messi goes to wolves
Messi isn't going anywhere.
Anyone that signs Messi isn't just signing the best player itw and all his magic and creativity. They're also signing a UCL type money every season from shirt sales and merchandise
Just imagine Messi doesn’t go to city and psg but instead he retires
Imagine Being Sergio Aguero now lol
Stoke better get promoted next season 👀
Welcome to Anfield
Aguero went to barcelona coz one of the reasons was he wanted to play with messi. That's a mere dream now.
Get real mark it's just city or psg not Chelsea..The highest wage is of kante who is on 290k a week..
Roman abrahimovic love messi... who knows what will be happened...
Messi come to Brentford
Funniest thing I’ve ever seen
Nah, Chelsea couldn't afford his wage. It'd be man city or psg
Messi is gonna end up in burnley fc.
Dont count out sean dyche picking up messi.
Shaking to see where Messi goes now
I think you are forgetting the MLS
Misleading title to be honest. Shouldve been, "MESSI CANNOT RE-JOIN BARCELONA"
I wish he comes to Chelsea but I can't see it happening.
It's always funny seeing United fans forgetting that they also are in the hands of billionaires lol
Mbape and Haaland need to learn from this. The way players like demanding stupid money because of their ability, like Messi, they could find themselves out of football without a club that can afford them at an early age.
Everybody:sad about Messi leaving Barca Aguero and Depay went to Barca to play with Messi:BeTRayEd
Pep x Messi, it’s happening
No one says ‘Hello Everybody’ quicker than Goldbridge
I'm never watching football again
Messi can choose where to go probably Man City or PSG
Arsenal will now break the bank. Arteta, make it happen.
Yes yes yes
Messi and Sergio ramos hate each other
Welcome to Chelsea
So when Cavani retires who gonna be his replacement? Nobody thought about this huh lol. Calvert-Lewin wouldn't be half bad for utd🤓🤷🏾‍♂️
LF Neymar RF Mbappe          CF/CAM Messi    No one will be stopping that lol.
Hoping if the glazers sign messi. It’s a dream 😂
Fabrizo couldn't even call this week 🤯
Could you imagine Messi going to Juventus? That would be insane to have Ronaldo and Messi in the same team
will we finally see Neymar and messi play together again?
spanish league in tatters
How the universe would be if messi went to england in his 20s , u think would still he the best player
Aguero: I cant wait to play with Messi Messi:                                                                                                                                                                                               *No*
Feel bad for aguero
“Arguably ONE of the worlds best footballers” understatement of the century 🤣
What about seeing him in an Arsenal shirt
No way
Transfer windows are becoming very toxic
Lets see him go to Juve and pair with ronaldo, just for a season
Has the 'Lenders' stock market fund dried up, so sorry 😜
The only way for Barcelona to get out of this mess is to go and find a bunch of Arab syeikhs to pour their unlimited oil money onto the club. Simple as that. Lol
As a Chelsea fan, I can confirm he isn’t coming to Chelsea. His salary is something  Chelsea will not do. Chelsea hasn’t paid any body £15 million a year not talking of a player that earned £100 million a year at Barca. Even is pay cut was £50 million a year. Chelsea isn’t that money crazy.
why do you keep referencing fabrizio romano lol, whats IndyKaila had to say on the matter?
Kane probably in his bed crying 😢😭🤣
The title of the video is wrong. Messi didn't 'quit' Barcelona, Barcelona didn't have the finances to give him a new contract
Definitely PSG
Messi goes to city, Ronaldo comes to utd... imagine
Messi to city most likely maybe psg
It's not gonna feel right now that messi wont be in a barca shirt
Calling it now - he will join PSG and ‘MNM’ (messi / neymar / mbappe) will be the new thing people say.
Now they need to retire the number 10 shirt for the 🐐
Messi is nailed on to go to PSG
imagine grealish has to give up the number 10 if messi joins city
Confirmed: Mikel Arteta convinces Messi to join Arsenal as he likes the prospect linking up with  young hector bellerin
Messi didn’t rlly quit on Barca
Oh how would I love for Messi to come to Liverpool 😁😁😁
Reckon PSG but perhaps Man City. Would like to see him play in England. The premiership hasn’t had a world star since ronaldo.
I think it's impossible for Messi move to City, City are now focused on Harry Kane, maybe PSG can take Messi for now
PSG didn't win the league last season
Messi to Arsenal confirmed
I mean you just would put your house on it that he will end up at PSG. Surely their wage structure would have to be checked for FFP cause I ain’t sure about Ramos mbappe neymar and Messi etc 🤭
Messi might go to MLS
Roman is on call rn to cancel Lukaku plan & get Messi onboard. I ain't a fan of Chelsea but it makes sense. They aren't getting Haaland, their main target anyway. So Lukaku or Messi should be an easy enough decision, no?
So ramos and messi will play together and incase mbappe leaves ronaldo will join them together
I doubt he would come to the prem. The prem is a tough league at the best of times he isn't a spring chicken anymore. My money is on PSG or America or China somewhere.
Doubt Chelsea could afford this tbh
PSG will be now on the way to signing Messi.
He should retire at the not so top of his game, PSG is really he only destination,. Because he won't like the premier league Messi getting shut out by a inspired burnley defense on a Wednesday night in November with it lashing down with rain, Messi is not the greatest ever player, Ronaldo is, he's done the business everywhere, Messi is a one club man.
Dare I say this but how about - "Let's be the only club 2 of the best ever players played for. I say why the hell not?"
PSG: “can’t not win that league anyway”  Ummm, check the table from last season, mate
OOF
Messi -> Arsenal :( :(😂😂
It’s crazy to think that Messi and ramos will be in the same team 😂
I want messi with bayern
PSG the most likely destination for Messi in my opinion.
Count out Juve at your peril. I'd put money on it right now! Arguably the 2 greatest players in history with the chance to play together.. Mark my words😎
PSG will sign him
Maybe we can finally see Messi and Ronald play together. Please go to juve
I swear its over. If PSG get Messi with Ramos at the back and other World Class its over.
4:56 Arsenal are looking at relegation they won’t be doing that if they get Messi
Hopefully he goes to man United
Can you feel sorry for a team that always outspent you, even when they didn't have to?
Messi to city ronaldo to united imagine that derby.
“Daryl from Norwich” 🤣🤣
Hell go to PSG cos it’s an easier league, then possibly MLS $$$
how can you say he quits thats not fair
Man City I think. He will sign a 5 year contract...spend 2 or 3 years in the prem, then 2 or 3 years at the sister club in America (New York is it?)
all this because of Bartomeu. Thank you clown
messi to villa after grealish departure
Chelsea is such an un realistic transfer and the way things are looking for Chelsea, they probably won’t take messi
I don’t think we have a chance against city anymore just stupid how much money they spend
Juventus should sign Messi
Chelsea can also take messi they have the money for him
China
Man U are in with a shout with Adidas sponsoring them both. Doubt they would want a Nike team getting him 😂
Come to Spurs
Even if Messi goes to Man City they still probably won’t win the UCL🤣🤣
If Messi comes to city, epl teams will start aiming for 2nd spot. Just imagine the fear all  epl teams and coaches  will have when they know they have to Face Messi Pep and Kevin DeBruyne😅
Part in good ways but they should have sold him
As a Madrid fan, I am very happy
I know exactly what Barca fans feel like losing Messi this evening - my beloved team lost the irreplaceable Ronaldo 12 years ago. But they will get over it. No choice.
Pep to Jack: "I need the #10 shirt back"
Mark just a note PSG didn't win the league last season. With Messi you would think they would but it is PSG they somehow always underperform even when they do win things.
Starting off your video with a lie to get views
Can’t imagine Messi and Ramos playing together😂😂
I don't have much sympathy for Barcelona, they've had the best player in the world for his whole career and he's leaving when he's maybe got 1 or 2 years at a high level left in him.
Providing they don’t do ANOTHER U-TURN on this, and ‘sort out’ the particular ‘economical’ problem. I believe he ll go to PSG. I am dreaming to see him in the Prem though. I want Pep to go all out and ditch the Kane deal and even resell grealish if it means he gets messi loool, that’s how much I want to see him in the Prem!!
This video is getting more views than what Sky Sports News has posted about Messi leaving Barcelona. MARK IS THE GOAT!
United could do the deal if they wanted to easily by throwing money at him if he goes to city or chelsea they cant buy lukaku or kane so think psg is most likely
I dont think he will only go somewhere for the money, he will go where he feels he can get what he wants from the rest of his career, the money will not limit him
He’s going to Aston Villa obviously….Messi with Emi Martinez and Buendia.
I'm happy for him. Should try new things for a change!!
Gold and Sullivan better cough up their savings from pimping women and sign him to play alongside Michail Antonio
PSG, Man C or MLS. In that order.
I’m hopeful my Palace might land Messi 🦅 🙏
Grealish got no. 10... City out of the race!!
who wants a player that wants 100m a year? no thanks.
aguero signs for barca and messi signs for man city wtf🤤
Please somebody tells me it's a fake 😭😭😭
Literally all the top clubs are owned by billionaires
what about juventes ronaldo and messi is a two
100M per year crazy
Goldbridge wanted to see Messi in the Prem in his 20s playing for Southampton it seems like
If juventus signs him and fields Ronaldo, Chiesa, Messi, it's gg
If Liverpool sign messi be ready for a great title fight
Football CHANNELS can be misleading. Messi is not quitting Barcelona, Barcelona can afford Messi and is not earning 1 million a week.
goodbye grealish. It was nice seeing you in a man city shirt
this is the result of spending 300m on Coutinho, Dembele and Griezmann.
Playing in Paris almost a certain outcome but I would love to watch him week in week out in the Premier league regardless of club its been to long the EPL hasn't had one of the top 4 players in world football
Ronaldo is the worlds best player. Messi is a close 2nd.
no one calling inter miami?
He didn't Quit Barcelona did he??! Honest to god!! both partys wanted a new contract sorted and it wasn't financially possible! Hardly quitting
Christian Pulisic will not be giving up that Number 10 shirt
> Aguero moved in to play with his pal. > Messi out of contract. > Probably goes for Man city > Aguero 😧
Bartomeow is to be blamed for all of this s..t!!!!!
I would love Messi to go back to Newells old boys. But that would never happen. If he goes to Man City or P$G, European football will be dead
It's only right he plays with the best midfielder in the world. Kante!
Aguero, Depay and co are PISSED imagine you sign to play with Messi and HE LEAVES the same season after like 100 years there 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
arsenal will get messi linked with us many times
If you told someone 5 years ago that Neymar, Messi, Ramos, and Keylor Navas would play together you wouldn’t know what to think 😂
Messi will go to PSG because Messi will want to earn big money in a rubbish league , easy money for doing nothing
Shocking😲
He should just go to China or retire. It would be like Giggs or Scholes playing against united.
It’s basically the  hunger games in the transfer window winner takes Messi
This is the biggest football news of the century
Psg are the favourites. Man City have bought jack grealish. Chelsea don't seem like they are able to buy him. Messi's friend , Neymar is playing in PSG plus Messi knows PSG can win everything single handenly
My god this is a terrible
I can see him going to PSG and Ronaldo going there as well.
If he goes to Chelsea it will be very intresting as they aren't clear favourites of anything and they are looking for a striker anyway and they can quite easily afford it with the money they have
Man U go get MESSI
Perhaps he just hangs it up. His heart isn’t going to be in it anywhere
He'll go PSG I think
I can see Harry Kane at practice at Spurs next week...... hahaha
Barcelona can move on now can really rebuild..Messu.needs a baby sitter hes never stepped out of.Catalonia
Wow! Barcelona certainly have serious financial issues. Sad really
He’s off PSG I don’t see him coming to the prem at all
Man u sell pogba? Get Messi? Long shot but maybe
Go to Juve and play with Ronaldo.
Aguero should be on suicide watch
This is why Barcelona etc were/are so desperate for the super League. They are broke.
Man City running back to Aston Villa to return Grealish: 🏃🏃🏃🏃
Ole would put Messi on the bench for a season so he can adapt to the PL
He fancies playing for Grimsby Town After watching the 🍿 movie 🎥
Every team and fans drooling for messi 🤣🤣
Come on London Blues
Messi to colchester, I would love to see him rip up the English lower leagues and bring colchester the FA Cup
The world’s greatest player is Cristiano Ronaldo
PSG!!!!
Man Utd need to buy Messi  Fliipping Glazers they better get Messi they steal all the money and all the money have they can't even get a proper trim they can do one and get Messi flipping disgrace mugs Glazers 🤢🤢
OFFICIAL: Man City want refund of Jack Grealish in pursuit of Messi
Man United could become the only club to have Messi and Ronaldo play for them
I presume psg now...
Deal with Chelsea is confirmed messi is joining chelsea
confirmed messi to bristol city
It's f**kin 💔
Messi to Astonvilla they can afford him 😂😂
I hope Messi comes to Manchester United
One of the most shocking moments of football history
Everybody expected Kane, Grealish and Mbappe to be the focal point of this transfer window.......but Messi stole the show !!!
Ronaldo and Messi combination at Juve. We can only dream
Are u dumb not Chelsea tiny club hes going to play in Argentina
I’m sure he’ll go to PSG
He’ll go to the MLS
man city im afraid
He’s chatting with Les Ferdinand as we speak
Messi has been without a contract for months and no one but Barcelona has made a move. I don't think anyone would want to bite that cookie.
Messi earns 2m a week and why do you keep putting Madrid and Barcelona in the same sentence
If I had a twitter account, I would have warned Romano that someone were seriously playing him. It was reported over a month ago by Sid of the Guardian that Barcelona can't sign someone like Messi unless they make someone expensive leave.
He won't leave  Mark my words
Why does fabrizo get credit una
Perhaps, Messi, will end up in U.S.A?
Neymar x Mbappe x Messi | What a line-up that could be
Breaking news. Tottenham have shown interest in Lionel playing at the London Stadium. If the deal can be done he's promised to sing 'All Night Long' and a host of his other best hits. Daniel Levy is in advanced negotiations to make it a double swoop with Gary Barlow to also sign. Tickets due out soon.
The embarrassed crook admittedly employ because football thirdly wrestle despite a plausible stinger. obtainable, slimy scarf
He will stay at Barca the league will change the rule for Barcelona and let them go over the salary cap.  he’ll sign his deal it’s all a ploy and they’ll sell a few players. Also he didn’t leave Barca they both wanted the contract signed but unable too as they haven’t sold anyone
Poor aguero the only reason he went to barca is for messi
If Messi goes to psg that would be so underwhelming
Feel bad for Kane if the possibility of city goes out the window because of messi wouldn’t wanna see Kane anywhere but the prem and no other clubs gonna buy him could be no club trophy’s for Harry for another couple years
DEPAY was so happy to play with messi looks like that's never ever gonna happen for him🤣🤣
No way will he come to England to old, legs have gone not strong enough. 99%  going to France. Or maybe back home if he doesn't care about making more money.
Messi to Man Utd 💯
watch messi lower his wages just to join Suarez in Madrid
Not sad... When you pay a player inflated money what do you expect.. Fans are ripped off just to see someone kick a ball around..would we pay you £1m a week of course not.. Regards Tony
I'll be so angry if he ends up at PSG. Buying the CL.
I would be gutted if he went to PSG, I would love to see him in the prem
hes going mci
It's kinda exciting but I wish he was younger when it happened. I'd like to see him at city to see how he goes in the premier league but I reckon he'll go to PSG with Neymar and Mbape. Plus the lifestyle would be more similar rather than in England. I feel sorry for Aguero... thought he was gonna play with his buddy, now he's moved on. And I can't believe I'm saying all that as im a united fan for 26 years, I just want to see how he goes in another league, preferably premier league ( but not cause I don't want to see city get better)..
I don’t reckon he would come to the premier league tbh
Barcelona fan here I just woke up to this news, my heart is in absolute pieces. I can't even begin to wrap my head around the situation it feels like the worst nightmare
I think if he will play this season it going to be in USA
I’m not even a Barcelona fan but I feel sad about this news 😔
I think PSG will try to its fullest ways to sign him.
If messi went to jevenntus Ronald +messi = wow
City be on phone to villa trying to return grealish 😂
Calling it heading Crystal Palace 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
PSG  next season =  Neymar         mbappe          messi                         Veratti            Wijnaldum     gueye Kurzawa ramos  Marquinhos  hakimi                       Donnaruma  Manager : pochettino  It's over  go home they will win every game they play
Maradona was better than messi he left barca and they got over it they will get over messi
Should they retire the number 10
I read this at work.. and it genuinely felt heavy.. like I had to stop for a second.. been a Barca fan for so many years firstly because of Ronaldinho but then it was always Leo.. This genuinely hurts..
He will just retire... His family don't want to move and he has nothing to prove.
No phone calls are happening. The deal was already done before the announcement.
City should use this to scare levy into selling kane QUICK
Why is it sad?
If you love football, you gotta hate psg…
History repeats itself! CR7 wins international trophy leaves Madrid! Messi wins international trophy leaves Barcelona! Coincidence or by design?
"darl from norwich in his messi kit will be crying" IM DEADDD
Leicester’s RW next season
Messi needs to come to the best league  in the world = the premier league
Don’t believe anything until he’s holding up another clubs shirt.
The best it’s no question at all. I want him at PSG him and Neymar back together will be so good
The best player that has ever lived so sad to see him leave Barcelona keep up the good content Mark ❤️
:(
Barca deserved this
I feel for Barca fans ❤👊🏾
Football is Changing
This is worse than 8-2... absolutely gutted
The nr.10 should be retired at Barcelona
Bayern also could so this
If he goes to city or psg they will rule
Aguero : Great now I can play with Leo Barcelona : No, you are the replacement
where ever he goes i will be a fan of that club
Wouldnt be surprising if he went to an mls team
Leo Messi, is he any good?
Now, Harry Kane will surely show up for training 🤣
He should join romero and lo celso at spurs
Kane . Awwww Lukaku . Awwwwwww Messi . Awwwwwwwwwww  Kane . Out of the way you   Aww
Man United should try get him we need a st /  cf and if we sell deadwood we will have the funds for wages
Honestly as a city fan with us just signing grealish I think there's no chance of us even going for him his wages are astronomical. PSG is the only place I'd imagine he has friends there and they're not afraid of stupid wages. He'll be in America within 2 years
I think he *might* just retire and *maybe* resign with barca at some point in the near future
A true legend honestly sad it ended that way still has at least five years at the top of the game still in him...think he might go psg and help them win the CL
werent they just saying he signed a new 5 year deal? what happened there?
Mark he did not quit Barca they are broke, skint, bankrupt not helped by us British fans, saying no to the SPL !!! Real are not in much better shape neither is Juve and are the Milan teams. And for the record, just how much do United owe creditors? He will be going to City and not Kane, can United afford Kane? maybe a pair of new boots for him and a box of hankies !!
What I'd give to see Messi and Ronaldo on the same side
It'll feel really weird to not see Leo not in Barcelona shirt that's for sure.
I hope he goes to Roma to join Mourinho
I think it depends if messi wants to have fun and relax psg, if he wants to dominate football man city w/ pep. But please join chelsea 🤣🤣 (chelsea fan)
City can have him  million pound a game
Messi, Mbappe, Neymar....MNM is going to rule Europe, with Ramos and Donnarumma.....
Aston villa got a few quid spare ,cover his wages for a couple of seasons
Poor Aguero now....came to Barcelona for Messi and now he's gone
Peps looking for his receipt for Jack Grealish
So hope he comes to Prem, how exciting this will be for the country
I bet Messi goes back to Argentina, maybe Psg or even the mls
Chinese club???
Just imagine if City sells sterling, Benardo, Jesus and gets Messi and Harry Kane. 😳
China could come calling
I also see an option that he won't join another European team at all for same reasons that Iniesta decided to go to Japan and Xavi to Qatar, they just didn't want to compete with or possibly even play against Barca. Now this would be an insane expectation but I'd love to see it. The options would either be the MLS, his home Argentina or even a career end
This is lesson to clubs trying to spend crazy money the books goto be balanced you want a club to exist after players move on
😂😂😂😂😂😂City just dumped 100 mill on Grealish.😂😂 Timing 😉
PEP OBVIOUSLY KNOWS MESSI REALLY WELL AND I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF CITY DONT SHOW INTEREST.......NOT ROCKET SCIENCE
He's not leaving
Scenes when PSG acquires CR7 & Messi and essentially have the most star studded team of all times.
Grealish signs for Manchester City
You got played 😅 I’m positive this is a trick by Barcelona to force the La Lega to relax its rules to allow them to sign Messi. The Spanish league yet to sign $2.7b deal with CBS network. If Messi leaves Spain, the deal is definitely off.
Son Kane messi
Would be great to see him in the Premier league.. But l think it will PSG.
He’ll stay at Barca.
Just imagine Messi helping City to finally win the champions league and the saying that Pep can’t win it without him becomes a reality 🤯
Of course someone think Messi leaves because of super league. Another AGENDA yet again.  Million pounds a week for what? It doesn’t take a million pounds to be fit. Lebron James spend $1 mil per year on being the best shape. But a week?   They should’ve sold him this summer and be done with it. Messi can sign with a cheap $100k a week contract and You can add signing bonuses and clauses to make more money..
What about Juve?
Peps about to open up a case with PayPal for a refund. No Pep, all sales are final.
Go to juve with ronaldo
The fact that Barcelona could have sold him last year for 100 million but were too stubborn and are now losing him for nothing because their finances are a disaster. I can’t help but laugh
PSG, Chelsea, man city, laliga football on it knee's 🤭🤭🤭
It’s ok, Fati will be the new Barcelona legend, just you watch.
This is so heartbreaking for the world of football💔
As a messi fan, I would like to see messi leaving Barca because the load on Messi's shoulder is a lot right now. I know the feelings of Barca fans too. Still it would be nice to see if he joints with pep for One Last Dance.
One reason : Josip Maria Bartomeu.
Thank god Messi will leave Barcelona
A change of massive proportions for the entire football world.
Messie will either go to PSG or Man City.
If man city get messi i wont hear the end of it 😂
pls go to juventus! I wanna see him and cr7 finally be teammates
Bruh I’m an arsenal and Barca fan, so I have a feeling, I’m going to have years worse, than I already have had soon.
Trully sad to see this, but im really excited to see whats going to happen next
Messi going to Spurs 🤣
when mark Goldbridge says Messi is leaving, then we all know that Messi is leaving Barcelona
Don't want him in Chelsea, as great as he is. Depending on one player so much is unhealthy.
Villa I reckon he has buendia posters on his wall
This is madness. The Transfer window now is going too crazy. We're going to have many clubs talking now. Messi NEEDS to take a pay cut now but if he doesn't then I wouldn't want him 1M a week no thank you.  Messi and Ronaldo in the same team for once I'll be anything for that! I
He’s not really leaving..
I thought we had it bad with Grealish.
🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️ City trying to return grealish
Messi might be able to show if he can do it on a rainy night in Stoke now
As a Barca fan I'm absolutely gutted. I was privileged to see messi a few times in the flesh at camp nou and it'll be strange watching Barca without messi.
Don’t understand why this is a shock…Messi wanted out last summer.
He will continue at Barcelona you heard it here 🔥🔥😒🙄
The worst news possible for Harry Kane hearing this lol! End of an era 100%
Looks like PSG won't mind selling Mbappe this window 😝
Why not just admitting you wish Man U signs him
He'll go to Stoke and do it every Tuesday night just to prove the haters wrong
This window keeps throwing up surprises. Grealish, Ings and now Messi. However I am sorry Barcelona deserve this punishment for creating the ESL and that are still in it.
I want to see Messi dealing with Premier League clubs.
Moment of silence for Aguero,Memphis🤣🤣🤣
RIP the GOAT
Barcelona have got no one to blame but thenselves
Kane deal to Man City is on the line
Can't wait to see the plastic Barcelona fans that only support because of Messi leave Barcelona
Quits?!?!!!
alright mark, i partially agree, as recent barca have been crap with making decisions financially , dembele, Griezmann ect, but back in the day, they were undoubtedly one of the best if not the best clubs at financially investing in players and buying players with huge potential and making them stars
Why can’t he just go on a lower wage? Stick him on 300 quid a week and he’s sorted.
Barca screwed themselves and I don't feel sorry for them.
I will be very surprised if he doesn’t sign for PSG
To even think that messi will eventually play alongside ramos is just speechless..
City have already ruled themselves out of the Messi race, it’s not financially viable even at City, Messi was earning £2.3m a week at Barcelona
At least Phil Jones is still at United.
Ed Woodward will be running around like a headless chicken trying to sign messi like when he did with fabregas
Don't think there will be that many clubs in for him. Who can afford his wages
If Messi goes to PSG and if PSG sign Suarez SNM is back
Wondering if Kane is worried now he might not get city move now. City wanted Messi for years
Spot on - only 3 clubs can stump up his wages.  Massive story.  I'd bet on PSG snagging him.
I find it hard to believe Messi couldn’t have taken less money. He’s made and will make more money than 99.9999999% of people in the world, you’ve tarnished your Barca story
will he retire??
As a Chelsea fan i just wish them russians will man up and put up like 200m for Messi, seeing Messi in a Chelsea shirt will make me buss.
Breaking news! MESSI HAS RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING HE’S RETIRING INSTEAD.
You know something about football??? Or you talk just to don’t shut up???
Inter Miami. (kidding)... calm down.
There’s gonna be such a transfer domino effect with this messi saga
Its tough, but im happy messi isnt being forced to play for a club. He deserves better!
Grealish to city just Confirmed
Barca no. 10 shirt without Messi unimaginable , never imagined
PSG most likely
Shocking
MESSI TO BURNLEY
My friend is a Barcelona Fan and I wonder whats he up to. Plus he doesn't usually keep tabs on transfer news, so his in for a surprise.
I predict it's PSG or City, but bold prediction, he goes to Roma and becomes what Maradona was for Napoli
Messi leaving Barcelona is like Fergie leaving United - the last piece of the last 15 years of Barca is gone
For everyone asking I will not be joining Barcelona this summer
Messi said he would like to go back to his boyhood club Boca Juniors.Don't be surprised if he signs for them
The end of Barcelona has come!
Sell Pogba...Bring Messi
Every top club in Europe knows that Messi is a cash cow even in his 30s he was responsible for approximately a 3rd or Barcelona revenues  Manchester United need to offer him a contract if they sign him i will buy 2 of that new jersey with that crappy new sponsor logo, the only competition for United is PSG, Italian clubs are trying to sell to get some money back in, bayern they have never set the market alight with any signing so they are out right there, City signed a player named grelish for 100 million i have no idea who that is, saw him make an appearance at the euro and got beat up by the Italian defence and that was it for him, Liverpool not gonna pursue him as long as Klopp is the manager, Chelsea already has a good midfield i wouldn't upset the team culture there so the only option in England is United, Manchester United just has to make the offer and lets be honest the midfield is talented at united but is poorly managed by Ole, lacks leadership and is missing a piece to take it to that next level the only thing that midfield is good at is being aggressive.  United need to offer Messi a deal Manchester may not be a vacation destination or is cosmopolitan like London but money move mountains.
Why you disappointing United fans Mark!! Why are you rulling us out of the potentially of getting Messi! Why not we can, we are United!! It's a good business deal for the Glazzers.
Messi at 34 is better than 99.9999999% of the players in the EPL.
Messi to Liverpool: James Pearce
Messi and Ramos in same team. 🤣  Who would have imagined.
Football is gone mad
Why you disappointing United fans Mark!! Why are you rulling us out of the potentially of getting Messi! Why not we can, we are United!! It's a good business deal for the Glazzers.
If City knew they wouldn't sign Grealish I guess
The goat will prove all the haters wrong now
If Messi goes to City then you can hand them the league now. No sarcasm, they've just got way too much quality to not win the leaghe
Pogba for Messi lol
Because of Chelsea's sales and potential sales, I think they could get Messi and Lukaku, considering what they spent last year. Man City just signing Grealish means they would have sooooo many wingers and so Messi would play as a false nine and Kane definitely wouldn't happen. Tbh I only see him going to PSG which is a shame cause I would have loved to see him in the Prem.
They always depend on messi to pull them out of a whole who do they depend on now?
If Messi joins City or Chelsea our goose cook 🍳. Continue hope that PSG get him
Do you think juventus could go for him ?!?!!
Unbelievable  moment in football history
Be interesting this is
Wenger “ I tried to sign messi in 2010”
If we get Messi to Man City and Ronaldo to man Utd we have a war on our hands.
Messi wouldn't go to chelsea😂😂😂 inter have a better chance of signing him than Chelsea
I’m off my phone for an hour...
Grealish is gonna fail his Man city medical beacuse of the serious issue that he isnt Lionel Messi
Him going to psg will be devastating, it'll just be for the money and I want him to properly challenge teams, not to a farmers league
Lmao poor aguero, went to barca to play with messi, and messi is now a candidate to join agueros former club
Look even if Messi ends up joining one of the top 4 team in the premier League seeing messi for me the goat for 38 games just watching him is a dream come true
Mark is so negative, all the other United channels say we have a good chance of landing Messi. Its all about feeling positive and Mark doesnt offer this. He even includes Chelsea as potential destination and always applause them for their transfer businesses when chelsea fans admit their transfer actions the last 10 years are crap and they cant even land Kounde.
END OF AN ERA ❤️
The investment needed was only available if they left the Super League and they wouldn't leave,
Can united sign him?
I SEE A 99 RATED END OF AN ERA FIFA 21 FUT CARD
Tears in my eyes
Its great for Barcelona. He's a massive headache and it'll release the future for Barcelona instead of waiting for the wonderful freak to pack it in.
Miami imo
All transfer froze after this shocking Messi News😂
how anyone could say no to having him in the Prem i dont know, if you love football, you want to see messi week-in-week-out
I wish i never meet Bartomou. If i do i might .....
Is any PL club going to pay £1m a week for Messi? It'll destabilise the club...
Messi according to reports is heartbroken. He's in shock. He wanted more than anything to stay.
ILL NEVER REMEMBER MESSI, NEVER RATED HIM, NEVER CARED FOR HIM SIUUUUUÙUUUUUCR7 the goat
Barca is just bluffing Laliga officials. I have a feeling he will still sign with Barca, they want the league to bend the rules for them. Lets wait and see.
Barcelona has a club of clowns running the show
Title misleading he didn’t “quit”
This is a massive day for football with this and grelish, will go down in football history and we were their!!
Messi didn't quit. He can't stay it's not possible. Because of la ligas new regulations.
It'll be so weird to see messi in a football shirt that isn't barcelona
If you were gonna sign Kane for 150 million I would sign Messi for a million quid a week for the next 3 years and still not have to pay Kanes wages
Comon united
Will be sad if Kun&Leo don't play for the same club together, thought we'd see them smash it at Barca
Just finished my fantasy pl team and now I hear messi might be coming to the prem 😭
It's all Barca fault .they had a whole window to sell there biggest earners like umtit,coutinho, griezamnn to fund the deal but they didn't want to beacuse they didn't wanted to get lowball offer . You're in a situation where you either sell these guys or you lose Messi and all the commercial value he brings .
Messi to PSG makes sense. He'll play with great players, be up against league rivals that financially have had to offload and probably win the league.
Clearly wants to play with Greenwood
Messi isn't winning the CL with Barca anytime soon, has maybe has two years left at the top!  PSG would be the favourite 100% as Paris is just as glamorous as Barcelona although colder in winter! But not as bad as the UK!
Messi actually joining Chelsea 🤩
Don’t forget Messi doesn’t want to quit it’s just all down to La Ligas silly financial fair play rules.
If Messi goes to man City does an man City fan want to swap my Newcastle fan ship for their man City fan ship ?
Either Chelsea, psg or city
The mastermind of the "Super League" just had a "super Blow"! LOL
Psg: 👀👀👀
It's £500k a week I believe and he was willing to take a 50% pay cut and also signed the contract but it's still not enough. It was only half the work from Barcelona's side. The other half was to reduce the wage bill which they didnt.
He's coming to arsenal. Arsenal board would give messi 250k a week 😂😂
Messi absolutely carried Barca in the last couple of years, feels weird tbh
I don’t think this is wise Barca is broke and that they need like almost €200m..plus they would be a bit more broke doing agüeros wages
More like Barca quit messi no way they chose super league over him yhe disrespect
PSG bound I think. I can’t picture Messi in a citeh kit. Just can’t envision it
So Ronaldo and Messi on same team anybody??
I think Messi would only want to go to psg or city. Chelsea can afford him but Messi wouldn’t want to go here. I’m a chelsea fan:)
I think David Beckham is gonna make a deal for Lionel Messi to come to Inter Miami over in MLS, Messi stated before that he actually wants to play in our crap league someday
He is coming to Leeds
Aston Villa will replace Jack Grealish with Messi.
Chelsea maybe?
if city took messi would united get kane ??
3:14 Let's not forget that PSG failed to win the league last season 🤣
He'll replace Kane. COYS!
Barca kept messi to make money
If Man City gets Messi, football will be ruined 😅
Barca are finished
Barca kept messi because of fans
Barca ain’t shxt without messi
I cant even imagine Messi in a different jersey than Barca's. So weird
he will retire
messi peaked 8-9 years ago
Good for Yusuf Demir👍
I dont care what team Messi goes to as long as he is in Premier League
He should go to juventus so him and Ronaldo can finnaly play together.
Poor Aguero 😂😂
Imagine Messi Playing Against Burnley 😆😆😆😆😆😆
Buying success on debt has its pitfalls it seems.
the end of an era, hopefully this doesn’t change barca’s career for the worst. it can only get better from here
Messi would never go to Chelsea
If Chelsea can get Messi then sell Werner, Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech. They dont need them anymore. Maybe even Reece James. That will  more than pay his salary. And no 90 million for Lukaku.
Mark, most of the top club owners are billionaires but most of them are stingy and not ambitious
Messis record against English teams ,is just something else😅😅. U don't want him in a Chelsea or city shirt
Any Daryls from Norwich here?
This is legit kinda sad       In other news I think he should join spurs! 😁😁
pep+messi= champions league
Mad to think the goat is without a contract📄
I go out on a date with a girl and pandemonium happens...
If he goes to City, would be epic for CR7 to return to Man U
Barcelona will struggle more without Messi then Real did without Ronaldo
Messi should come to America, which would promote football aka ‘soccer’ to heights.
Barcelona need a new striker. Liverpool need to offload Divock Origi and Takumi Minamino. This could be a win win
united should go for pedri next year
Messi wearing different jersey is looking weird
Apparently Tebas would have facilitated Messi's inscription if Barca left the Super League for good, and Laporta said no. Makes you wonder how much we should still be worried about the Super League
Would mbappe stay at psg if they signed messi ??
Messi to city here we go incoming, Barcelona getting what they deserve, good riddance for a while
If it's upto Messi to chose a club Where he wants to go. PSG will definitely get him bcz of Neymar.
Aguero said he moved to Barcelona because it's always been a dream to play with Messi at Club level... well that's out the Window
If Man City sign him I am packing up watching football and rest of us must do the same for it is now becoming a farce.
This video was recommended to me and at first glance, I thought it was a joke but then looked more carefully and read the comments. Can’t believe this is true! Guess I won’t be getting any sleep tonight..
Kane better go back to training 🤣
Bartmoeu made barca so financially worse that messi was forced to leave. A masterstroke right here!
I damn hope he goes to PSG. If he goes to Man City we will all have no chance. I also don’t think he would want to go to Chelsea. Come to Liverpool, Messi! 😂
he made me love Barcelona can't believe we will be seeing Barcelona without Messi ,very sad.idk if Im gonna like the team Messi gonna join or Barca more becoz that's how much Messi made me love barca.
He will be back at barca this is just a power move to add more wage allowance
PSG are not even champions now.
Barca are never gonna be the same without messi😢
Barcelona, new Arsenal. History, Traditions, on the decline every season and gets wacked by Bayern
Just in: City demanding for a 10 day return policy on Jack Grealish
Can imagine in an office at city right now.... Look lads, we can either sign grealish for 100mil pay him 200k a week n sell 100,000 shirts.... Or backhand Messi 2mil signing bonus, pay him 400k a week out of money we don't spend on grealish n sell million shirts n tons of other Messi merchandise......
I would want him in any epl club if not in man utd.
He should join arsenal and help them reach 7th !!
I can't imagine messi in anything other than the Barcelona shirt
It's official Messi going to city
If city don't get Kane then pep might get a sniff
Marina Granovskaia... PICK UP THE PHONE
psg will be too overpowered with messi and if he joins city all city fans won't stop talking it's gonna be hell😂
Barcelona are imploding and it's such sweet, sweet justice.
This is a powerplay too quick Barcelona have 4 weeks to negotiate and quit on Messi that quickly This is surely some game from laporta And no farewell is announced till now only a press conference with laporta
RIP Laliga 😂
The worst thing that can happened is Messi playing against Barcelona
Messi would be a decent grealish replacement for villa
He was the world's best player....34 years old now and not worth the wages....I'd rather halland....
I am shivvering now this is not happening
If Messi goes to city Kane is left behind its a shame honestly
This day was obviously gonna happen but I wasn’t ready 😯
When neymar leaves Barce to get out of messis shadow, and ends up in messi & mbappes shadow
Forget lukaku her messi
This is nuts. I’d love to see him in the Prem but I just can’t imagine seeing him go from sunny barcelona to the miserable weather of England
3 oil clubs in chelsea city and psg - every trophy they win is plastic and worthless
Messi: joins Chelsea  Pulisic: 😩❤️‍🩹😠
He won't come to chelsea, we only offer players over 30, 1 year deals.... 😂😂😂
Would man utd fans take messi and accept he's the best ever player to play for man united ?? Just a stupid question.
Aguero thought he would be playing with messi loool bye
If the goes to paris… Sell Icardi…bro is Dangerous😂👀
The city of Barcelona will loose their mind now.. they will never forgive everyone who converted the world's best football club into ruins
So this is what a heartbreak feels like 💔
I’m not going to lie when I say this but when you where talking about I literally was about to break into tiers cause I’m a Barcelona fan but there’s other reasons why I love Barca but it’s just hard to take this in because I grew up watching Messi and I always be a Barca fan with or without Messi
Anyone else thinks there is a big chance he goes back home and play for his boyhood club
If Messi goes PSG!  NEYMAR  MBAPPE  MESSI  OH MY😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
BREAKING NEWS! Aston Villa are in talks with Lionel Messi to replace Jack Grealish
For Barcelona loosing Messi means loosing all Argentine fans & that doesn’t means only citizens of Argentina but a greater population from all around the world where our countries doesn’t play football in nation or club category where Messi & Argentina is supported by 75% of these countries people.
Take back Graellish, keep the change, have our condolences.
FC Barcelona is the whole circus.
👀 ronaldo — dybala — messi
He is going to city..its all a bit last minute but city chairman scrambling to get a deal togfether
harry kane is sh*tting bricks rn
Aguero should have stayed
p l e a s e  ANSU FATI – MEMPHIS – MOUKOKO
Messi to stoke city let's go!!
City should sign him for sure leave Kane
Do you think he'll retire because of this?
PSG will be unbeatable now
Pep: Hello Mr. Villa, I would like return Jack right now. Also pep: Hello Mr potato head, I would like to withdraw our interests and offers for Harry, we no longer want him.
He just wants more money… just like a lot of footballers… he’s greedy AF
Harry Kane going back to Spurs with his tail between his legs 😂😂
I'm sorry but Lionel Messi isn't the best player in the world stats don't lie and the stats say that CR7 is the best player in the world....?
Pep: when you have Messi on the bench cuz he doesn’t get the chemistry
Messi to arsenal
He’s going Aston Villa grealish replacement inbound
According to my sources he wants to experience a cold wet night in Stoke and see if it's all that
I believe he's always dreamed of playing for Liverpool 😉😂😂😂🙏
All I know what ever messi does jn his league might be all that but he will never choose epl knowing he wont be the best player in epl at all
Poor old Harry Kane must be crying in his missus arms that he will be staying for another 3 years challenging for conference leaugue 😭😭😭
Cancel grealish
I would drop Kane now and sign MESSI🤣🤣🤣
He goes to United it changes so much 🙈
Majority of us are united fans here but this news hurt a lot 💔
im done hala madrid
Messi potentially in the prem? Am I dreaming?
I think it's disrespectful not to include Liverpool in the race for Messi   John W Henry needs to step up. The coronavirus is not an excuse. If your not up to the challenge pack your bags and leave because one signing isn't enough.
This is why Southampton sold Danny Ings. We all know it has been a lifelong dream of Messi's to play alongside Theo Walcott
United need to go in for him ASAP
Pep talking Harry Kane and hears Messi is available: Wait a minute, who aaaare you???
Barce gonna become the new AC Milan
Messi has a strong familial connection to Italy. I wonder if any of the three big Italian clubs have the cash?
BREAKING: Villa sign Messi ‼️
Its not because barcelona doesn't have the money to pay messi. Its because of la liga's new wage cap from this season
Mark do something to sign Lionel Messi
dont worry hes coming to liverpool
If there is any reason for United to get rid of players, this is it
End of an era , gracias Leo, thanks for the memories
If Messi joins a primer league club it will end the debate of the greatest footballer in the league 😤
City will drop the kane idea which they should and they go straight for messi.
city will get him for 1 season until they sign haaland. To many egos  at Psg
Please not man city, PLEASE NOT MAN CITY!
One of the saddest days in football. Never thought this would happen, it’s officially the end of an era.
aguero:WTF am i here for then
I wouldn't even be mad if he went to city, he deserves to play on what would be one of if not the best team ever... and id love to see him play in the prem
Damn right Kane will be worried, i see Messi at City or PSG myself
Honestly this does not make sense. Messi not in a Barca shirt is heartbreaking for me and other Barca fans. We can only blame our ownership but we are all heartbroken right now.
CITY IF GET MESSI WILL WIN CL NEXT YEAR -THEY CAN PAY 1 MILLION POUND WEEK
Man u should sign him and prove that ole cannot win even with messi
Mark - I wouldn't turn my nose up at messy playing at United - you bet you wouldn't.
This is all La Liga's fault
end of an era.
This is Bartomeu's fault. He has the biggest amount of blood in football history on his hands.
It's really official. Barca lead by IDIOTS! They knew the rules and they still waited for his contranct to expire. They even signed Aguero only because of Messi. Such a disrespectful way to say farewell to a living Legend! BTW Messi never gonna go to the Prem os PSG if he won't retire he will go to MLS he said it him self he want to go there for 2 years and after that he will come back to Barca for another role.
I will never forget Messi in Barca he will always be true Messi for me
Barca and real are where United was 4-5 yrs ago
Harry Kane is shitting himself now lololol.
CHELSEA CANCEL RL AND GET MESSI IN PREM - LOVE TO SEE MESSI IN PREM LEAGUE -
RIP Aguero
Arsenal are going to offer him a trial 🤣🤣🤣
I LOVED BARCA BECAUSE OF MESSI,I LOVED FOOTBALL BECAUSE OF MESSI!!!!!!!!! MY HEART IS BROKEN!1
If Messi goes to Man utd ill have to leave mah london blues🤒
Honestly this doesn’t make sense. I never expected too see Messi not in a Barca shirt. As a Barcelona fan I am heartbroken. When I was a kid I always watched him cheating him on and now he’s gone… I’m really dissapointed in our owners their fault but now I’m just heartbroken.
Barcelona has left Barcelona
Messi is leaving is because Barcelona couldn’t get rid of Griezmann wage 700k a week,it was either Griezmann or Messi to leave to leave
My top 5 contenders for signing Messi (%): 1.PSG 40% 2.Manchester City 39% 3.Chelsea 19% 4.Manchester United 1,5% 5. Liverpool 0,4% That leves 0.1 % for the rest of the world.
Pep returning Grealish to Villa🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
I think he will go to PSG is easy league and 99% he win some trophy there
If PSG get Messi and CR7 next season they will win the Champions League for sure
It is actually insane that Messi just now followed Man City on Instagram… yayyy I hope messi comes to city, we won’t need Kane then
Man city want a grealish refund
Cancel that cheque to Aston Villa....
Breaking News : *Man City have the receipt and will return Jack Grealish*
PSG get messi and Kylian goes to madrid and ronaldo goes to psg🤔🤔
Bayern?
Simply as a football fan, this is deeply saddening.
Arsenal fans getting hyped now
I mean the tables have turned is all I can say cause yes it’s sad because clearly his intentions was to retire at barca but they’ll finally know how it feels to lose their greatest player and it is completely their fault
If there is one club I would like to see Messi go to as a Barca fan, is Juventus. Just so we can watch him and Ronaldo play in their final years.
Goldbridge, I really enjoy your channel but stop pretending United are Oliver Twist!  Your Net spend is higher than CFC along with players on absolutely massive wages.  Narrative is getting weak!
So now City will just buy the league. It's over guys if they get Messi or Kane its over almost no chance for anyone else
If I watched anything other than the Premier League I'd probably be devastated.
Even if Messi goes to Manchester City, as a Manchester United supporter it will be tough to see the best footballer to ever grace this game arguably to play for your city rivals so is frustrating, but imagine Messi playing in the best league in the world, the premier league, that would be incredible.
Can we go in for him at UTD  or is going PSG / CITY / CHELSEA
Grealish calling his lawyer trying to figure out if his contract with city cannot be taken back
PSG would be the best choice for him.
City or PSG are the only options imo
I find this hilarious, this club and fanbase is getting exactly what it deserves
Messi won't go to psg coz of ramos
Scenes when rocks up at Aston Villa 😂😂😂
Messi took one look at Memphis Depay’s finishing and thought “That’s it, I’m off.”
This channel never lets an opportunity for a few clicks go begging does it lol
Kane to city officially off next 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 he is stuck at spurs. No way in hell pep doesn't go in for him now
messi cr mbappe neymar at psg
LIONEL MESSI WELCOME TO INTER MIAMI
Messi, grealish,kane  for Man City
Man City front 3: Grealish Kane Messi lol
I’d love to see him in the premier league, maybe Man City knew he was leaving so didn’t dive in with the £160m for Kane 🤔
1 2 3 now its .... Nobody😢😢😭
😭😭😭😭😭
Imagine a Messi,Neymar,Mbappe in the French league.  I feel for the French teams
It's Michael Jordan leaving the bulls and going to Orlando magic where he peters out, becomes mediocre and retires
Will city really smash their wage structure? I kind of hope they do and then all their other stars will want the same
messi "quits" what sort of title is that
Um....this is rather shocking...no?
what the hell you mean he quits? it’s a problem of management, he wanted to continue
Love your content , Mark !
Im hurt and crying but Farwell to my goat Messi and my idol I love you bro have a good career in wherever you go next and I will be rooting for u to lift the well needed UCL
Soooo thats why Southampton sold Ings
Tuchel just stopped lukaku transfer !!!!
He should come to Watford, he would be a good back up for Ismaïla Sarr, we need competition in that spot
Messi needs to win the World Cup to be the best player ever
Imagine Ramos Messi Neymar mbappe and probably Ronaldo nxt summer 😂😂😂
Just saw the news and it stopped my heart honestly. I was hoping to see him in Barca for a couple more years, but never thought it would happen now. Im gutted. Shame on Barcelona for ruining it all.
This is the biggest moment in transfer and football history
If we look at it liverpool could benefit the most because they don't have a creative midfielder ( thiago is just a box to box ).
If Messi goes to Pep and Man City we might as well just hand them the Premier League title right now especially after Jack Grealish.
Wait, what
Messi is going to psg cause in his vacation at Ibiza Neymar was there Paredes is there   verrati is there and Dimaria
I can’t even imagine Messi without a Barcelona jersey on
Pinch me
TOOK EM LONG ENOUGH?
Evening being a united fan, it feels so sad and heartbreaking 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭.
messi leavs  manchester city : well the league is ours then lads
Welcome to Chelsea
We might find his hero was Stanley Matthew’s and he has always had a deep-seated desire to play for Stoke or Blackpool.
Messi leaving Barcelona is one of the shocking moments in the history of sport
Messi - City Ronaldo - United would be a dream for the premier league rivals to have the two No.1 players of the last 10+ years to finish off their careers
Pain
Premier league waiting for that huge cash, revenue kit and viewing if messi somehow land on english team 😂😂
Sad day for football, doesn’t matter who you support
Confirmed : Messi to Southampton  after Danny Ings' departure .
Messi screws up all the plans everyone had, Haaland could now go united PSG or barca
Man City or PSG are definitely Messi's next destination 💯👀
This is NOT a surprise! This is reality biting
I think he should go to PSG
Aguero will be fuming if he goes to city
Yeah this is the start of a six month depression for me
Think that’s probably the Spanish league finished then. Why else would u watch the league?
No way he goes to Premier League, he'll break.
Imagine city get him
😮😮😮😮
I would love to se leo in the prem Chelsea or shiity
Messi to City. Next Year Ronaldo to Man U
Messi's 100% going PSG, just look at instagram posts by Di Maria for example, Messi is chilling with players which are all from PSG
I want to see Ronaldo and Messi in the same team……
Last Year Was The Worst Year For The World And This Year Is The Worst Year For Football Fans,Ramos,Varane,Messi Is Gone....End Of The Era
Has to be a Nike club!
Barcelona fans trying to blame Messi for his wages when the club have wasted money on players like Dembele, Coutinho and Griezman
absolutely shocking
You all failing to realize that now pogba has a reason to go to psg if Messi is heading the same way 😭
Gonna go to city or psg
In a parallel universe where he goes to Burnley...
The possibility of Xavier comming to coach Barca now is out. Koaman about to be fired soon.
Whichever team he signs with, I'm going with him🥺❤
Imagine he joins Juve probably won't happen but that would be soo good to see him and Cr7
Barcelona have been falling but now they've finnaly hit the ground
Villa will have him
City will get him no financial fair play this year thryll just say we'll have him
I think it’s interesting that messi posted a picture with 5 other PSG players
He won’t leave lololol.
I am crying
Sky sports 2030- man united are yet to agree personal terms with messi’s camp
This is a win for football. It means regulations still have to somewhat be followed and big clubs can't just do whatever they want
Was waiting for this🍻
One of the saddest days in football history
Kane can go back to Totenham training now😂😂😂
The biggest news in football history
can imagine pep trying to go back to aston villa with the grealish receipt
If he where to play for United, where would you play him. Jadon as an lw and Messi as an rw. Benching rashford martial and Greenwood
I can really see Chelsea getting him if the Inter board fall for the fan guilt of promising not to sell Lukaku
So Harry Kane is staying at a Spurs 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Messi needs £1m pw minimum
FINALLY THE TRANSFER MARKET HAS SOME EXCITEMENT !!!!!!!!
Nobody's gunna get fees for players on huge wages anymore that's a fact
Chelsea had just pull out of lukaku deal 🤔🤔
Saul to LFC ✅✅
Plot Twist: Chelsea knew Messi wasn’t going to resign for Barcelona. That’s why that haven’t bought any players this summer transfer window. So they can get Messi unopposed because no one can afford his wages!
I know Barca fans already hate bartomeu but after Messi leaving and knowing he had the biggest part to play in Barca recent fall. Jeez I don’t think he can even walks the streets of Barcelona 😂😂😂
Glazers we trust you...do your thing..LM10
Aguero 🤪
Mann I'd love to see Messi to play with Cristiano Ronaldo.
He'll surely go to Leeds, with his fellow Argentinian as coach and all
Wonder whats going on with the Kane deal now
odds on messi ends up at bradford city
Messi if i ever leave barcelona to another european club it will be to liverpool Can't wait for him to join us good backup for harvey elliot
Man City to sell grealish so they can get messi
The 🐐 is arsenal bound 😁
Imagine if he goes to juventus 😳
Should go back to newells old boy’s
We need a striker
People sleeping on Atletico Madrid
😔
Pep will have already had conversations with Messi, long before this announcement.
Pep punching in the air rite now
I was waiting mark! ❤️
*UNBELIEVABLE!!!*
Aguero is running away to city
I actually hope he goes to psg, then to see them take cr7. Would love to see that. Also would be hilarious to see psg psg up the champions league with that squad and lose it again😂
There’s only 3 clubs can really afford him and 2 of them have had a huge window already
forget Jack Grealish to man city, Messi has left Barca 😳
Messi has changed the face of sports without actually doing anything
Bet you united stands gonna have a show that’s gonna read “ messi to united” ???
Im literally crying🔵🔴🔵🔴😭😭😭
Hope he comes prem waste to go PSG !!
I swear if he retires, its gonna be so sad.
Grealish Kane messi that would actually be scary with de bruynes service aswell are you mad 🤯
Messi for £0 or Kane for £160m, I know what Man City would rather do
Agüero right now:🤡
The St position at City is vacant tho Kane hasn't signed yet
I feel bad for Sergio Augero. 🤣🤣
I think a reunion with neymar at psg is where he will go
It would be biblical if messi went city and Ronaldo come to united
Never thought I'd see the day
Will he retire ?
Spare a thought for the parents that have forked out 100 quid for little jimmy from Birmingham  to have messi on his new barca top Hahaha
imagine if he goes to chelsea i support them we would win the league by miles i swear.
If Messi goes to City then the title race is already over for the next season ..
He might want to go to another club with Football 'Eritage
A moment in history, I’m a United fan but if it meant he had to go to city for me to see him in the premier league then I want it to happen.
If only this came earlier; Pep would ditch Grealish. I worry for Kane
He is going to Real, we know this!!!!!!!!!! I think Bayern could get him.
Rumor has it not of the stipulations in Messi's contract was actually that if he were to resign, Barcelona must not join the Super League. They disagreed and Messi said deuces
I would absolutely love to see messi and cr7 play together whether it be at psg or juventus but i really doubt it will happen
Messi has been my childhood football player it’s sad to see him leaving Barca will miss him a ton
If Messi can wait just a bit longer and if we can make the transfers he can come
Daniel Levy masterclass incoming.
Sad day for football
I am soooooooooooooooooo sad 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Fantasy football will be interesting if Messi is in the premier league
MBAPPE TO MADRID , MESSI TO PSG. WHAT IS THIS TRANSFER WINDOW OMDS 😭
This shows how much Bartomeu ruined Barcelona.
Laliga is finished
I hope he doesn't end up like Ronaldinho
Nah I have goosebumps 😱 This Day will Go Down In History
He should go to Dortmund with haaland Reina and Bellingham, may have a chance of winning the league
end of a generation
Would love to see Messi in the prem.  Not at Citeh however but lol
PSG. Now we know why ManC went cold on Kane.
It is a shame that he is leaving Barca. I'd love to see him at City but I think he goes to PSG.
I'm a barca fan I'm in teers I can't believe this
Messi is a money grabber
Messi and pep go together like red wine and steak
This is Ronaldo’s chance.
*W h A t . . .*
There is no one in this world to replace him at barca.or never will be in this century.
He had an agreement with Barca, went on vacation with psg players and the deal fell off im convinced he will join psg
The greatest player moves on...
Mark Messi discount 50% of his wages to sign a new contract but now can that help other clubs to buy him
He should join Burton Albion
Give him no.7 shirt
Hope he joins juve just imagine.
the goat was never supposed to leave Barcelona :(
My bet is he is going to PSG. Too many reasons for him to choose them. Pochettino is his countryman. Neymar is there. PSG are on course to win CL. And they are team full of superstars.
aguero get done by messi
Messi is coming to liverpool . (In my dreams🥲)
Surely City can’t sign him after grealish deal? Thought FFP still has some part to play?
He’s going to psg. Mark my words
Finally he can do the dream move and take Burnley to the Champions League
Most likely to go to PSG because of neymar.
If Chelsea get's Messi everyone else is screwed
Wow! Wow! Wow! Never would I have thought this day would happen, hope he comes to the prem so can watch him live.
He'll probably wind up at Man City too.
after all the talk of an extension, this is heartbreaking
The end of an era, a legend, a eternal he made me love Barcelona will miss him. It is very hard to imagine watching Barcelona without him. I wish him the best of luck in his life. Will continue to watch him wherever he goes. Thank you leo
As a united fan and knowing we definitely won't sign him, I'd be gutted to see him gone to city or chelsea...
Will go PSG or City, I hope PSG but Pep could convince him. Thought Kane and Grealish would be bad but Messi and Grealish, not good for English football because no one can compete with that business on top of the team they've already got
The Neymar Messi friendship and the fact that he’s really good friends with paredes and Di Maria could actually lead him to Paris… my god that front line Neymar, Mbappe, Messi, Icardi and Di Maria would be the backups 😂😂
Aston Villa really let Grealish go, knowing Messi was leaving. Dean Smith you genius. youve done it again
If Messi goes to PSG man then it’s over
I'll take um at scunthorpe
I've been waiting to see him perform in another league
He will become an END OF AN ERA 99. AND EVERYONE SHOULD DO IT 😓😥😰❤️❤️
This hits more bad than super league
No way he’ll come to the premier league, he’ll go to psg 100%
Sky Sports! Jim White!
Chelsea, Bayern, PSG & if City sacks Pep will have a chance to pile up Champions League Trophies over the next 5+ years b/c there is No one who can compete w/ them on the European landscape
My fear is that Messi played quite a bit at CF under Pep at Barca, it feels written in the stars
Sadly, he’ll probably go to PSG or Man City
First Puyol, then Xavi, Iniesta, and now Lionel Messi, the golden generation of La Masia is coming to an end 😔 Note: i know Busquets is still at the club
Chelsea should forget lukaku and spend all their money on messi
Pep: Hello Mr Villa, we would like to return Jack Grealish...yes Sir, he was a few sizes too big
ANNOUNCE MESSI
If Messi goes to PSG, Mbappé will sign a new deal.
I swear United can do this deal. No transfer fee, just give him the 50 million contract offer they gave to Pogba which he declined. £450,000 a week, plus give Messi £10M sign on fee to sweeten him. 4 year deal. I want “Here We Go”…! Please I pray 🙏🏾
Whoever gets messi in the PL will be unstoppable.  Please be Man Utd.  Please.   If Utd don’t get messi. They have to get haaland this year.
Unpopular opinion : I would not be surprised if Messi retired; he is 34 which is retirement age, he has now won an international trophy which means he has won most things individually and as a team that u can in football, he is seen as the goat by many, he wants to stay loyal and be at Barca for his whole career, and his wages would be too much for clubs at 800k-1 mill a week at Barca. Laugh at me if u want by I would not be surprised if this happened.
I feel for Kane. It's horrible for us as well Mark, I don't think we can get 21 in a year or two.
Messi to Tottenham???
lets hope he comes to united ay. LOL
Abramovic leaving Milan rn and forgetting about Lukaku to go sign Messi
Messi at chelsea and it's all done ✅
💔.
That’s Everton’s winger issue fixed
If man city get grealish kane and messi what a team lol
I only see him coming to PSG
it would feel so wierd to see Messi in a jersy other than Barca or Argentina.
End of an era. He'll either go to the Prem or return back home to Argentina
Shocking.
He will go to Chelsea. PSG or city.  They will give him £100M signing on fee  £250k a week and then likely £100M in paintings as a gift
I think he should go to Chelsea
Barcelona aren’t getting top 4 this season
I think liverpool have a real shout. Salah Messi Mane front 3. That's the best front 3 in the world. And this is from a United fan
This is still not as shocking to me as when beckham left man United
Messi didn't quit Barca, Barca quit on him with the stupid transfers they had done in the past couple of years.
Out of all the scenarios I envisioned where messi would ever and i mean EVER leave barcelona, this would probably be last, sad day for football, for barcelona, this is probably the equivalent of the big bang for them, they're gonna have to reset massively, and absolutely change the whole infrastructure at the club, because like it or not, messi is probably like 50% of barcelona whole revenue (spansors, merchandises, tactics revolving around him, etc etc)  advertisement)
I hope he goes to city. And makes even more of a mockery of the premiership .
I think that Barcelona we will go downhill because if you let one of the best players who is played at your club also do you feel sorry for the Barcelona fans about this situation with Messi leaving their club.
great news for Derby County though, they are only allowed to sign players who are out of contract 👀
I heard it's to do with Messi wanted Barca to sign Cristian Romero
Harry Kane will be training at Spurs tomorrow 🤣🤣🤣
He’ll go to PSG, no way will Messi fancy a Tuesday night against Tarkovski and Ben Mee at turf Moore…
Shame that he will choose an Oil club
Someone bring cr7 n messi together...make our fifa dreams real😂
All good things must come to an end
PSG are where all his friends are and Man City is where Pep is....so interesting
Get him to stoke
Barcelona quits messi
MESS MESS, IS HEADING TO MAN CITY😂
Newcastle fan here I’d love to see him at Man City or Chelsea be amazing to see him in the prem my team doesn’t invest but still love them but love to see the greatest player ever in the best league in the world
FEEL SAD FOR AGUERO 🥲
1 club...PSG
I honestly couldn't care I only care about Manchester United
imagine glazers get messi in united only for saling t shirts 🤣🤣
1 52 arguably come on goldbridge
So the day has come.
Next few days / weeks will be very interesting. Will City go and get him instead of getting Kane and / or Grealish. Will Chelsea go and get him instead of Lukaku? PSG will definitely have something to say. I don’t see United going for him. Liverpool could be enticing for him. Could he go to Italy? Or even go to the MLS early? It’s going to be very entertaining no matter what happens.
*Aguero joins Barca to play with Messi* *Messi Leaves Barca* Aguero:Am I A Joke To You
Messi to Dortmund as Sanchos replacement confirmed 💛🖤
I think he’s staying
Oh wow. 😢
Terrible business for Barca. They got offered 100 million and 4 good players for Messi last year from city. They knew they couldn’t afford him.
To Arsenal he goes
Lets get him at old trafford
start a go fund me for barcelona
Harry Kane might be better getting back to training now tbh
Messi coming to arsenal
Genuinely, watch this space, this is something the Glazers would do to ensure they never get protests again. United would offer stupid wages for this bloke...
Augero be like: Man City buy me again pweeze
I wont believe until hes holding up another clubs shirt. Heard it all before and it the last minute messi gets more money
😭😭😭😭 Hala Madrid
Where is he going to??
Mike Ashley too break the bank and sign Messi just too make more money on shirt sales heard it here first
Wow
god id love love him in the prem even if he would repeatedly destroy my team
Here’s where he just goes the mls
what an absolute madness of a football transfer this year
Omg imagine Messi and grealish
The only two clubs who could afford his wages is PSG and City tbh. 1 has Neymar and 1 has Pep. Messi you choose 😭
Why do you keep doing these cringe thumbnails with a cringe expression why not just do a normal face and stop being a beg
I could see Chelsea and PSG in for him
He could go to America.... shame if he did
Messi to Arsenal
I bet Harry Kane is gutted!
'prime Barcelona' isn't prime anymore
I hear that Norwich are preparing a bid to sign him.
Gonna be weird to see him in another shirt
Leo Messi at Barcelona:  ♦️778 games ⚽672 goals 🎯305 assists 👑6 Ballond's 🏆36 trophies
END OF AN ERA!
sky sports jim sports, Messi at PSG
The man had the grace to embarrass Scholes,the trickery to bamboozle Nani,the strength to bounce off Vida,the blance to glide past Giggs,and scored a header! between Rio and Josh,past VDR. I HATED Barce in those days.Pique played out from the back with incredibly courage.Xavi/Iniesta's keep ball skills,killed Rooney's determination,Busquets fell over whenever touched..... But I simply couldn't hate Messi.He has brought us all so many wonderful memory's,which is what sport boils down to at the end.  Lauda v Hunt Federer v Nadal Ali v Frazier ,none of these rivalries comes close to M10 v CR7,they made the post 08 recession bearable.
If city get Messi, I can imagine there will be a lot more city fans  Jokes aside
Messi,Neymar,Mbappe.. MNM(M&M)
Guardiola: We made a mistake, we thought we were signing Grealish in FUT, can we give him back to Villa, please? I want Messi.
PSG needs to be stopped
We never thought this day would happen that messi would leave Barcelona
Messi used to take 7% out of the club and bring in 35% of Barcelona money
I reckon he's Chelsea bound
Chelsea to Messi😂😂😂
man I'm depressed
i honestly still do not believe what happened, what a shock
Messi x Mbappe x Neymar That should be illegal
Wait if messi goes to Man City surely Ronaldo has to come to United as a last dance Goat vs Goat
Imagine City take Messi and forget about Kane. Would be unbelievable craic
Messi to City, Ronaldo to united
Bad news, Missing Messi in BARCELONA Jersey, CANNOT think
man city playing real life fifa if they get him and kane, soon we wont be only club to win treble then
Id love to see Messi in the Prem. Even if he joins a rival opposition. Watching him week in week out on MOTD is what dreams are made off
The end of an era man crazy how he’s leaving
You're saying you feel bad for Barca fans but I promise you 95 percent of Barca's fanbase except for Catalonia will follow Messi to whatever team he goes. They are plastics.
A good example of why United should not pay Pogba £500k per week. Once you set that precedent, good luck keeping your wage bill under control!
City gonna cancel grealish contract and go for Messi now 🤣
First Ronaldo and now Messi 💔
Messi leaving cause eibar is relegated😂
ed woodward sign messi you wasteman
I'm a Liverpool fan. Some might not like what I'm about to say but, and I honestly would love to see Messi play for any top PL side. Yes, even our biggest rivals United. I just love English football, its the biggest, most glamour, sexiest.. and Messi would fit in perfectly. Its good for everyone if you think about it.
☹️
I want a refund from villa
Since when is chelsea not an oil club😂
messi to napoli confirmed to make maradona proud
he goes to PSG i think
Grealish joins City just to get benched by messi lmao
He will go to Man City
Imagine the GOAT at a mid table club in the prem 😮
Such a sad moment in football
WOOOOAAAAAAAHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!
"PSG cant not win that league", Lille enters the chat
City, psg: allow me to introduce myself
Barca going bankrupt
It’s actually quite insane and also sad to think we will never see Lionel Messi in a Barcelona shirt at the Camp Nou ever again.. one of footballs most famous chapters has closed in such an insane way.
Classic Ed Woodward signing
Psg so
Monumental shift in the game
GraciasLeo End Of An Era
I would have never gussed that so many big moves would be  happening this summer
I will always be a barça fan ❤️💙
No way who else was not expecting this
A million a week epitomises what's wrong with football.🎯
Maybe he goes to juve to play with ronaldo 🤞🏽
Would love to see him at Juventus. Ronaldo + Messi.
As a barcalona fan i just cannot see him at any other club. This is just heartbreaking.
Losing him will suck for Barca and their fans. Do look at the upside Barca fans: your club might invest more since they can’t relay on 1 player. Maybe more youngsters who could be the next great could make it through with an open spot. Not saying this is a good scenario but at least a couple good things will come form this.
He is going to Villa to replace Grealish and hook up with his new best friend Emi Martinez.
Stamford bridge is waiting for you. Roman bring him in 👍
Oil Fc:Write that down...write that down!
If messi goes to psg he will unstoppable with neymar but I still hate that he is going out of Barca
Can't wait to see Messi at Turf Moor
Forget Kane go get Messi Pep...
Hope barca retire the no10
He's on the phone to Bielsa as we speak.....
could we see messi and ronaldo playing in the same team?
I CAN’T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING! We may see the GOAT playing in the premier league.
😂😂😂this guys thumbnails
I probably need to bleach my eyes if I see Messi wearing any other kit beside Barcelona
Man Utd getting thrashed 7-0 to City if he comes to City 😭
If he ends up at City this League is done!
It is sad for both parts, but I think it is also very exciting
I literally forgot all, everything in the world for a moment.It's painful.ngl I wanted Messi to go to a place where he can have UCL winning project, even I was  Barca follower from few years only but my heart just skipped a beat. Adios GOAT Leo.
Could he go to MLS now🤔
This is the craziest thing ive ever seen and all i have to say is please not psg or man city please!!
I think he will go to PSG and be with neymar
barcelona's gonna end up in the europa leauge now messi I think he will go to the premier league chelsea is a possible
He should come to arsenal
Him at Juventus would be brilliant
end of an era!
Messi to Chelsea makes a lot of sense, sign him on a 1 year deal, and then he can go back to Barcelona and Chelsea sign Haaland
Pep guardiola : come to me son  Messi : am coming ,plz wait for me
he'll retire or go back to Newell's Old Boys
im just shocked as barca fan...
10k views in 5 minutes shows how big messi is
Swap Pogba for Messi
My childhood but Manchester United will leave the light on for you like a motel 6 Leo 😀 But Messi going to Stoke I heard to prove that he could play rainy nights.
End of an era to say the least never thought this day would come 🥲
I honestly can't see him in any other shirt and I ain't even a Barca fan, can't even begin to know how Barca fans feel
PSG
Get Messi Glazers just like you got Brady and won the SB. Get him now
Barca can't afford his wages barca in the mud 😂
Chelsea
Liverpool need a backup for salah
Do you think City regret buying Grealish now?
Man U should sign Messi play him on the rw and have sancho on the Lw as rashy is out realistically longer than 2 months and then next year put him CF? we wish
If he go to city I'm not watching football imagine how many follower manchester city will get manchester united is in a mud
Messi to Manchester United if Glazer sign the best NFL player for their NFL team. They should do same with Manchester United and sign the best player in world.
He's not the greatest player stop
This came out of nowhere till yesterday it was all smooth but to here Messi is no more Barca player is shocking . Oh my god still can’t believe it
where would he go?
This is deffo the craziest and surprising window arsenal spending money on actual good players aston villa buying bailey and ings out of nowhere man city signing grealish Chelsea and lukaku man utd varane and the list goes on
Honestly never thought this would happen but barcelona have put them selfs in this situation with the the amount of money they pay to players and spent on transfers
Why shouldn't we laugh at them. They are one of the super league teams. Karma
Has to be PSG
Its PSG for me
He's going to Leeds!!!
😭😢
Chelsea is a very interesting one! They can afford him, they need someone.. could easily happen! But if Pep comes knocking he may join him... very interesting
Benardo Silva to Barcelona?
I am a chelsea fan and i couldn't be happier that Barcelona are crumbling like a pack of cards
Omg this is the most shocking news ever
Love to see him in prem, but more likely to go to paris.
Will it be PSG or City?
I hope he goes to either Man city or PSG
Fellow commenters and mark: where will he go? My money would be on city. He can finally play in the prem which is probably the best league rn, and they have the most money to throw at him. It would also mean Kane would stay since they can’t get both him and Messi. It saves city the Kane money to get a top tier forward. Thoughts?
Messi to City ... Kane to stay at Tottenham??
Kane will turn up to training tomorrow 🤣
This was inevitable, did Barcelona really think they could have cleared over €200M in wages?
Would love to see him in the prem
Can’t wait to see him at arsenal, good back up for Saka
I'm u utd fan but I want messi to go to man city
Messi at City , Ronaldo at united one can dream
as a spurs fan i’d love to see him join any prem team just to watch him week in week out city do ur thing
Who else just watched the vid of oh my goal and 99%
Griezmann punching the air rn, finally gets to play in his position
Barca statement says its not financial
Ramos, Messi, Neymar, Mbappe 🔥 🔥
It's sad that he won't be going back to Barca, but I'm happy as long as he doesn't go to PSG.
Messi just shattered Harry Kane's future
Chelsea here to get Messi
I'm happy... He can finally join a good club that he deserves...
He deserves more. Legend
Pep is trying to cancel the Jack Grealish deal to sign Messi 😂😂 😂😂
I don’t think I’ll ever be able to accept it
Bring him to Manchester United
very scared of the thought of him at city, perfect for peps false 9 system absolutely perfect
PSG: Neymar Mbappe (Mbappe leaves psg) PSG: Neymar Messi Ronaldo  🤣 Imagine
heartbreaking and i’m not even a barca fan
Mark the quick uploads are sick keep up the sick work🙏🔥
City he will go
Aguero joined for Messi to leave😭
Any club that wanted to sign Messi will probably benefit alot from that deal. Jersey sale, revenue etc etc
Someone pinch me I might be dreaming! 😍😍😍
This is one of the biggest shocks football has ever seen
will be really boring if he goes to PSG
He will go Man City kane deal off
Hope he goes to juventus
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that's them in for every good player that's up for sale in the next few weeks 🤑🤑🤑
😮😮😮😮
Messi could move to Bayern?
The goat has left man. I can't believe it
Man City rushing to cancel Grealish’s contract rn
I hope he joins Juventus, to see Messi and Ronaldo play next to each other would be amazing, even if it’s for one year only
PSG 😐
Messi to Man Utd ! Yeah right... I am guessing he will end up in Italy
This guy kept me alive during lockdown
Someone protect Laporta and get him out of the city, he’s in real danger
I'm so excited!
Ladies and gentlemen Please can we have a moment of silence. we have just heard that Lionel Messi has just left Barcelona since he was 14 he was in Barca wow
Villa’s new signing
WAIT WHAT!!!
EOAE Messi?
